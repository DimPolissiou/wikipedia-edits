I ended up managing them and producing them and writing with them.\"<ref name=\"CRAugust\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/features/iron-maidens-steve-harris-on-british-lion-solo-project/ |title=Exclusive: Iron Maiden\u2019s Steve Harris talks about his British Lion solo project |accessdate=8 September 2012 |last=Brannigan |first=Paul |date=27 August 2012 |magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020112709/http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/features/iron-maidens-steve-harris-on-british-lion-solo-project/ |archivedate=20 October 2013 }}</ref> After the original band split up, he \"kept in touch with Richie [Taylor, vocals] and Graham, and then Richie was working with another guitarist called David Hawkins, who's a really talented guy, and so we started writing songs together.\"<ref name=\"CRAugust\"/> After several years of work, due to Harris being occupied with Iron Maiden, the album ultimately consists of \"six songs written with Richie and David, there's one with just me and Richie, and the others are me, Richie, Graham and a couple of other guys that were around at the time.\"<ref name=\"CRAugust\"/> In an interview published by ''[[Kerrang!]]'' in September, Harris said that he considers ''British Lion'' \"more of a side-project\" than a solo record.<ref name=\"kerrang lion\"/>\n\nStylistically, Harris argues that the record is \"more mainstream rock than metal, very British sounding, very 70s-influenced and quite commercial\u2026 but good commercial. There's all kinds of stuff going on, with nods to [[the Who]] and [[UFO (band)|UFO]] and some classic British rock bands, but it's not the progressive rock album some might be expecting.\"<ref

as letting his strings \"go dead\".<ref>{{cite episode | title = Iron Maiden | series = [[That Metal Show]] | serieslink =  | credits = [[Eddie Trunk]], [[Jim Florentine]], [[Don Jamieson

''[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]]'' also gave it a score of 3/5, although they praised the \"cohesive\" song-writing and referred to Taylor as \"a compelling hard-rock singer\".<ref

The album was announced on 18 July 2012 and released on 24 September.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/iron-maidens-steve-harris-announces-first-ever-solo-album-british-lion/ |title=Iron Maiden's Steve Harris Announces First Ever Solo Album ''British Lion'' |magazine=[[Metal Hammer]] |date=18 July 2012 |accessdate=18 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223010938/http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/iron-maidens-steve-harris-announces-first-ever-solo-album-british-lion/ |archivedate=23 February 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==[[British Lion (Band)|British Lion Band]] Background==\nFollowing the initial announcement of the album's release in July 2012, ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' revealed that the project originated with a band, named [[British Lion (Band)|British Lion]], which Harris had been mentoring in the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/news/maidens-harris-announces-solo-album/ |title=Maiden's Harris announces solo album |accessdate=8 September 2012 |last=Kielty |first=Martin |date=18 July 2012 |magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130119104531/http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/news/maidens-harris-announces-solo-album/ |archivedate=19 January 2013 }}</ref> Harris confirmed this during an interview with ''Classic Rock'' the following month, explaining that he became involved after \"Graham Leslie [guitar] came to me with a cassette of songs... and I thought they were really good, so I said I\u2019d try to help his band do something. I ended up managing them and producing them and writing with them.\"<ref name=\"CRAugust\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/features/iron-maidens-steve-harris-on-british-lion-solo-project/ |title=Exclusive: Iron Maiden\u2019s Steve Harris talks about his British Lion solo project |accessdate=8 September 2012 |last=Brannigan |first=Paul |date=27 August 2012 |magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020112709/http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/features/iron-maidens-steve-harris-on-british-lion-solo-project/ |archivedate=20 October 2013 }}</ref> After the original band split up, he \"kept in touch with Richie [Taylor, vocals] and Graham, and then Richie was working with another guitarist called David Hawkins, who's a really talented guy, and so we started writing songs together.\"<ref name=\"CRAugust\"/> After several years of work, due to Harris being occupied with Iron Maiden, the album ultimately consists of \"six songs written with Richie and David, there's one with just me and Richie, and the others are me, Richie, Graham and a couple of other guys that were around at the time.\"<ref name=\"CRAugust\"/> In an interview published by ''[[Kerrang!]]'' in September, Harris said that he considers ''British Lion'' \"more of a side-project\" than a solo record.<ref name=\"kerrang lion\"/>\n\nStylistically, Harris argues that the record is \"more mainstream rock than metal, very British sounding, very 70s-influenced and quite commercial\u2026 but good commercial. There's all kinds of stuff going on, with nods to [[the Who]] and [[UFO (band)|UFO]] and some classic British rock bands, but it's not the progressive rock album some might be expecting.\"<ref

as letting his strings \"go dead\".<ref>{{cite episode | title = Iron Maiden | series = [[That Metal Show]] | serieslink =  | credits = [[Eddie Trunk]], [[Jim Florentine]], [[Don Jamieson

stage, remarking that, although \"there are no shows arranged yet\", \"I know we\u2019ll be playing clubs, which is great because I\u2019ve not played clubs for years\", and that he intends to release

''[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]]'' also gave it a score of 3/5, although they praised the \"cohesive\" song-writing and referred to Taylor as \"a compelling hard-rock singer\".<ref

The film received positive reviews, but was a [[box office bomb|box office disappointment]]. It is also the first animated feature film to be theatrically released by Warner Bros.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story is set in 1895 [[France]] and takes place predominantly in [[Paris]]. However, it begins on a farm in rural [[Provence]]. The lovely cat Mewsette and the accomplished but shy mouser Jaune Tom are in love (\"Mewsette\"), until the former is frustrated with his plebeian ways (and those of the farm), to the point of calling him a \"clumsy country clod\". Inspired by the human Jeanette's stories of [[Belle \u00c9poque|glamour and sophistication in Paris]] (\"Take My Hand, Paree\"), Mewsette runs away by taking a train to the big city (\"Roses Red, Violets Blue\"), where she encounters the slick con-cat Meowrice ([[Paul Frees]]). Taking advantage of the country kitty's naivete, he puts her in the care of the sultry Madame Henretta Reubens-Chatte, who promises to turn Mewsette into a dainty [[debutante]] known as \"The Belle of all Paris\". Unbeknownst to Mewsette, Meowrice is grooming her to be the [[mail-order bride]] of a rich [[Americans|American]] cat in [[Pittsburgh]] known as \"Mr. Henry Phtt\" (\"The Money Cat\"). Meanwhile, Jaune Tom and his sidekick Robespierre arrive in Paris, searching for Mewsette.\n\nTraining does not go well. Just as Mewsette is about to give up and return to the farm, Meowrice takes her out to see the cat side of Paris, the [[Eiffel Tower]], the [[Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]] and the [[Moulin Rouge|Mewlon Rouge]] and then take a buggy ride back home (\"The Horse Won't Talk\"). Reinvigorated, she returns to her studies. Jaune Tom and Robespierre arrive just at that moment but get waylaid by one of Meowrice's shadowy cat henchmen and barely escape drowning in Paris's famous labyrinthine [[sanitary sewer|sewer]]s.

The film received positive reviews, but was a [[box office bomb|box office disappointment]]. It is also the first animated feature film to be theatrically released by Warner Bros.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story is set in 1895 [[France]] and takes place predominantly in [[Paris]]. However, it begins on a farm in rural [[Provence]]. The lovely cat Mewsette and the accomplished but shy mouser Jaune Tom are in love (\"Mewsette\"), until the former is frustrated with his plebeian ways (and those of the farm), to the point of calling him a \"clumsy country clod\". Inspired by the human Jeanette's stories of [[Belle \u00c9poque|glamour and sophistication in Paris]] (\"Take My Hand, Paree\"), Mewsette runs away by taking a train to the big city (\"Roses Red, Violets Blue\"), where she encounters the slick con-cat Meowrice ([[Paul Frees]]). Taking advantage of the country kitty's naivete, he puts her in the care of the sultry Madame Henretta Reubens-Chatte, who promises to turn Mewsette into a dainty [[debutante]] known as \"The Belle of all Paris\". Unbeknownst to Mewsette, Meowrice is grooming her to be the [[mail-order bride]] of a rich [[Americans|American]] cat in [[Pittsburgh]] known as \"Mr. Henry Phtt\" (\"The Money Cat\"). Meanwhile, Jaune Tom and his sidekick Robespierre arrive in Paris, searching for Mewsette.\n\nTraining does not go well. Just as Mewsette is about to give up and return to the farm, Meowrice takes her out to see the cat side of Paris, the [[Eiffel Tower]], the [[Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]] and the [[Moulin Rouge|Mewlon Rouge]] and then take a buggy ride back home (\"The Horse Won't Talk\"). Reinvigorated, she returns to her studies. Jaune Tom and Robespierre arrive just at that moment but get waylaid by one of Meowrice's shadowy cat henchmen and barely escape drowning in Paris's famous labyrinthine [[sanitary sewer|sewer]]s. By coincidence, Jaune Tom displays his incredible mouse-hunting skills in front of Meowrice (known as \"Virtue-Mousety\"), who sees a money-making opportunity, gets them drunk (\"Bubbles\"), and sells them as mousers to a ship bound for [[Alaska]]. On the ship, Robespierre consoles a depressed Jaune Tom, telling him that any problem, regardless of size, can be broken up into manageable pieces, by remarking that even the mighty ocean is made up of little drops of water. Jaune Tom has a vision of Mewsette singing about how no problem is unconquerable, and the importance of never giving up (\"Little Drops of Rain\").\n\nMewsette finishes her training and is now lovely enough to impress even Meowrice, who commissions a series of [[painting]]s of her by such famous artists as [[Claude Monet]], [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Georges Seurat]], [[Henri Rousseau]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Edgar Degas]], [[Auguste Renoir]], [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], [[Paul Gauguin]] and [[Pablo Picasso]] (an opportunity for the animators to indulge in some artistic [[Parody|parodies]]), so that he can send them to Mr. Phtt. Meowrice quietly writes a check to pay his \"sister\", Madame Reubens-Chatte (using [[disappearing ink]], so that the check is worthless), and takes Mewsette to his hideout in [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]]. There, he reveals his plan to ship her to America and tries to coerce her to enter a luggage crate, but after seeing a portrait of Mr. Phtt depicting him as fat and old, she manages to escape Meowrice and his sidekicks.

The design, finalized in December 1969<ref name=\"Taylor2013\">{{cite book|author=James Taylor|title=Mercedes-Benz S-Class 1972-2013|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hpMmBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT40|date=15 December 2013| publisher=Crowood| isbn=978-1-84797-596-6|page=40}}</ref> was a dramatic leap forward, with more masculine lines that combined to create an elegant and sporty character. The basic design concept carried through the themes originally introduced on the [[Mercedes-Benz R107|R107]] [[Mercedes-Benz SL-Class|SL-Class]] [[Roadster (automobile)|roadster]], especially the front and rear lights.<ref name=\"w116.org\"/> As for the SL, the W116 received the ridged lamp covers which kept dirt accumulation at bay; this was to remain a Mercedes-Benz design theme into the 21st century.<ref name=KB0516>{{cite journal | ref = MS16 | journal = Klassiska Bilar | title = \u00c5rets vinnare | trans-title = The year's winner | language = Swedish | date = June 2016 | number = 5 | publisher = Bonnier Tidskrifter AB | location = Stockholm, Sweden | page = 40 | first = Mikael | last = Stjerna | volume = 5 }}</ref> The W116 was [[Friedrich Geiger]]'s last design for Mercedes-Benz; his career had started with the [[Mercedes-Benz 500K]] in 1933.\n\nThe car was presented in September 1972. The model range initially included two versions of the M110 engine (Straight-six with 2746&nbsp;cc displacement)\u2014the 280 S (using a Solex carburetor) and the 280 SE (using Bosch D-Jetronic injection), plus the 350 SE, powered by the M116 engine (V8 with 3499&nbsp;cc displacement). After the 1973 Fuel Crisis, a long-wheelbase version of the 280 was added to the lineup.\n\nHalf a year later, in early 1973, two new models powered by the M117 engine (V8 with 4520&nbsp;cc displacement) were added to the range\u2014the 450 SE and the 450 SEL (with a 100&nbsp;mm longer body). The 450 had {{convert|225|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} in most markets, federalized cars offered {{convert|190|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} while Swedish market cars had an [[Exhaust gas recirculation|EGR-valve]] and {{convert|200|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} until 1976.<ref name=KB0516/> The 450s received a plusher interior as well, with velour or leather seats rather than the checkered cloth of the lesser models. The door insides were also of a different design, being pulled up around the windows.<ref name=KBp42>[[#MS16|Stjerna]], p. 42</ref>\n\nThe most notable W116 was the high-performance, limited-production [[Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9|450 SEL 6.9]], which was introduced in 1975. This model boasted by far the largest engine installed in a post-war Mercedes-Benz (and any non-American production automobile) up to that time,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.classicdriver.com/en/article/cars/lap-luxury-mercedes-s-class-w116 |title=In the lap of luxury: The Mercedes S-Class W116 &#124; Classic Driver Magazine |publisher=Classicdriver.com |date=2013-07-11 |accessdate=2016-07-16}}</ref> and also featured [[self-leveling suspension|self-leveling]] [[hydropneumatic suspension]].\n\nThe 300 SD sedan (American market only) had a turbocharged 3.0-litre [[Straight-five engine|inline-five]] [[diesel engine]] developed from the [[Mercedes-Benz C111|C111]] experimental vehicle. \n\nThe 450 SE was named the [[European Car of the Year]] in 1974, even though the W116 range was first introduced at the [[Paris Motor Show]] in the fall of 1972.<ref name=KBp39>[[#MS16|Stjerna]], p. 39</ref> The W116 range became the first production car to use an electronic four-wheel multi-channel [[anti-lock braking system]] (ABS) from [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] as an option from 1978 on.\n\nProduction totaled 473,035 units. The W116 was succeeded by the [[Mercedes-Benz W126|W126]] S-Class in 1979. The W116 was sold throughout Europe, the Americas, Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Australia.\n\n==Models==\n[[File:1978 M110 2.8 Litre 6 cylinder Engine.jpg|thumb|1978 M110 Engine, Twin cam straight 6.

A slight power reduction was a result of this update. In 1978, a series of engine upgrades restored original performance levels with new fuel injection systems. Initially the early models (1973-1974) of the W116 with the Twin Cam inline 6 used the D-[[Jetronic]] fuels injection system with computers and MAP sensor that are both prone to failure after more than 20 years of use. From 1975 onward they used the [[K-Jetronic]] mechanical fuel injection system, a less complicated system that proved to be much more reliable in the long run and injectors cost 6x less than the D-jetronic system. The W116 equipped with the K-Jetronic system, used a cast-iron fuel distributor, which can be prone to rust over time if moisture or water is present in the fuel. This was changed to an alloy fuel distributor in the following model [[W126]] and is not subject to corrosion.\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n!Chassis code\n!Model Years\n!Model\n!Engine\n!No. built<ref name=\"Oswald\">{{cite book |title=Deutsche Autos 1945\u20131990, Band 4 |lang = de | last= Oswald |first=Werner | date =2003 |publisher=Motorbuch Verlag |location=Stuttgart |isbn=3-613-02131-5 |pages=80, 86}}</ref>\n|-\n|W116.020||1973\u20131980||280 S sedan|| 2.8 L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M110 engine|M110]]'' [[Straight-six engine|I6]] || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 122,848\n|-\n|W116.024||1973\u20131980||280 SE sedan|| 2.8 L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M110 engine|M110]]'' I6 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 150,593\n|-\n|W116.025||1974\u20131980|| 280 SEL sedan|| 2.8 L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M110 engine|M110]]'' I6 || style=\"text-align:right;\"|7,032\n|-\n|W116.028||1973\u20131980|| 350 SE sedan|| 3.5 L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M116 engine|M116]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]] || style=\"text-align:right;\"|51,100\n|-\n|W116.029||1973\u20131980|| 350 SEL sedan|| 3.5 L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M116 engine|M116]]'' V8 || style=\"text-align:right;\"|4,266\n|-\n|W116.032  ||1973\u20131980|| 450 SE sedan|| 4.5 L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M117 engine|M117]]'' V8 || style=\"text-align:right;\"|41,604\n|-\n|W116.033  ||1973\u20131980|| 450 SEL sedan|| 4.5 L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M117 engine|M117]]'' V8 || style=\"text-align:right;\"|59,578\n|-\n|W116.036||1975\u20131980|| [[Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9|450 SEL 6.9]] || 6.9 L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M100 engine|M100]]'' V8 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 7,380\n|-\n|W116.120||1978\u20131980|| 300 SD sedan||  3.0 L [[Mercedes-Benz OM617 engine|OM617]] [[Straight-five engine|I5]] [[turbodiesel]] <br/> (United States and Canada only) || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 28,634\n|}\n\n=={{anchor|6.9}}450 SEL 6.9==\n{{main article|Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9}}\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1 = 450SELI 0411.jpg\n| image2 = Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9 US.jpg\n| caption2 = US market 450 SEL 6.9\n}}\n\nThe high-performance 450 SEL 6.9 version of the [[Mercedes-Benz S-Klasse|S-Class]] was built on its own assembly line by [[Daimler-Benz]] in [[Stuttgart]], Germany and based on the long-wheelbase version of the W116 chassis. The model was generally referred to in the company's literature as the \"6.9\", to separate it from the regular 450 SEL.\n\nThe 6.9 was first shown to the motoring press at the [[Geneva Auto Show#1974|Geneva Auto Show]] in 1974, and produced between 1975 and 1981 in extremely limited numbers. It was billed as the flagship of the Mercedes-Benz car line, and the successor to [[Mercedes-Benz]]'s original high-performance sedan, the [[Mercedes-Benz 300SEL 6.3|300 SEL 6.3]]. The 6.9's successor\u2014the top of range [[Mercedes-Benz W126|500 SEL]]\u2014continued the 6.9's remarkable [[self-levelling suspension|self-leveling]] [[hydropneumatic]] suspension as an extra-cost option.\n\n===Special features===\nThe 6.9 was the first Mercedes-Benz to be fitted with the [[hydropneumatic]] [[self-levelling suspension]] system introduced by [[Citro\u00ebn]] in 1954, unlike the 600 and 6.3 which employed [[air suspension]]s. Using a combination of fluid-filled struts and nitrogen-filled pressure vessels or \"[[hydraulic accumulator|accumulators]]\" in lieu of conventional [[shock absorber]]s and springs, the system was pressurized by a hydraulic pump driven by the engine's timing chain. Compared to the new Mercedes-Benz system, Citro\u00ebn's was belt-driven, exactly like a conventional power steering pump; failure of the Citro\u00ebn system thus might result in loss of suspension. Conversely, every unit of the 6.9 was shipped with hard rubber emergency dampers that served as temporary springs and allowed the car to be driven in the event of a hydraulic failure. The special [[hydraulic fluid]] required by the system was stored in a tank inside the engine compartment. Not only was the system totally self-adjusting, [[ride height]] could be altered by a dash-mounted push-pull knob under the speedometer that raised the car an additional two inches (50&nbsp;mm) for increased ground clearance.\n\nThe suspension system gave the {{convert|4200|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} car the benefits of a both a [[ride quality|smooth ride]] and [[car handling|handling]] that allowed it, in the words of automotive journalist [[David E. Davis]], to be \"tossed about like a [[Mini]].\" The car also featured a model W3B 050 three-speed [[automatic transmission]] unique to the 6.9 and a standard ZF [[limited slip differential]] both for enhanced [[roadholding]] performance on dry pavement and enhanced [[traction (engineering)|traction]] in inclement weather.\n\nFour-wheel [[disc brake]]s and four-wheel independent suspension were standard on these top-of-the-line models. The [[Mercedes-Benz M100 engine|M100 engine]] is a [[cast iron]] [[V8 engine|V8]] with single overhead camshafts which was a bigger version of the engine also used in the [[Mercedes-Benz 600]] and the [[Mercedes-Benz 300SEL 6.3]]. Notable is the Bosch [[K-jetronic|K-Jetronic]] electromechanical [[fuel injection]], forged crankshaft, connecting rods and pistons, and a \"[[dry sump]]\" engine [[lubrication]] system. As a result, the engine itself had no dipstick for checking the oil level. Rather, the dipstick was attached to the inside of the tank's filler cap (accessible from the engine compartment) and the oil level was checked with the engine running and at [[operating temperature]]. The non-American market trim version of the 6.9&nbsp;[[litre|l]] (6,834&nbsp;cc or 417&nbsp;in\u00b3) power plant was rated at {{convert|286|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and 405&nbsp;lb\u00b7ft (549&nbsp;N\u00b7m) of [[torque]], helping to compensate for the 2.65 to 1 final [[mechanical advantage|drive ratio]] necessary for sustained high-speed cruising. The dry sump system also had the benefit of extending the oil change interval to 12,500 miles (20,000&nbsp;km). This, along with hydraulic valve lifters which required no adjusting and special cylinder head gaskets which eliminated the need for periodic retorquing of the head bolts, made the 6.9 relatively easy to maintain and service for its first 50,000 miles (80,500&nbsp;km). The 6.9 required little basic service other than coolant, minor tune-ups, oil changes, and replacement of the air, fuel, oil and power steering filters.\n\n===Performance===\nTop speed was factory-rated at 140&nbsp;mph (225&nbsp;km/h), but some journalists testing the car saw speeds approaching 150&nbsp;mph (241&nbsp;km/h). Among those journalists was [[Brock Yates]]. Yates was approached by the factory to write promotional literature about the 6.9 for advertising purposes. He agreed under the condition that he could list the car's faults as well as its positives and create an unbiased review. Daimler-Benz agreed and Yates was given an American-market spec 6.9 to drive from [[Manhattan]] to the [[Road Atlanta]] grand prix race track in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. There, Yates would drive the car in as-arrived condition at racing speeds for a full 40 laps or just over 100 miles (160&nbsp;km). His complaint on this long drive on public roads was that the magnetic CB antenna blew off at 130 miles per hour. The only change made to the car upon its arrival at Road Atlanta was an adjustment of tire pressure. Driving 40 laps was a difficult task for the street-legal full size luxury sedan primarily designed and geared for comfortable [[Autobahn]] cruising. The 6.9 suffered no major mechanical problems and averaged a respectable 72&nbsp;mph (116&nbsp;km/h) throughout the test, completing it with little more than excess dust on the bodywork from the [[Michelin]] [[radial tyre|radial]] street tires on which the car was driven to Atlanta. Yates was so comfortable driving the 6.9 around the track that he reported having run at least one lap with the sunroof open and the radio on, but the high price of the car made him think better of such risky driving and he finished the test with the radio off and both hands on the wheel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.m-100.cc/6point9/brochure/brockyates/index.html|title=6.9 Brochure \u2013 Brock Yates Story|work=m-100.cc}}</ref>\n\n===Price and interior features===\n[[File:450SEL6.9 dash.jpg|thumb|Interior]]\n\nAll of this technology came at a very high price. At a time when the most expensive [[Cadillac (automobile)|Cadillac]]s, the mid-sized [[Cadillac Seville|Seville]] and [[full-size]]d [[Cadillac Fleetwood]] [[Cadillac Series 70#1971\u20131976|Series Seventy-Five]] [[limousine]] each listed for about US$16,000, the 6.9 listed for around $40,000, more than the Big Three but less than most [[Rolls-Royce car|Rolls-Royce]]s. When the car was officially introduced into the North American market for the 1977 model year, the price was well past $40,000 and was $52,995 by the end of production. Though the 6.9 was undeniably a luxury car, the decor was rather austere compared to the sheer opulence available in a Rolls-Royce or full-sized Cadillac. The interior was identical to that in the less expensive models except for the push-pull suspension control knob just under the speedometer, a low suspension pressure warning and height adjustment indicator lights in the instrument cluster, and wood trim finished in burled [[walnut]] veneer on the dash and console. The rest of the W116 lineup was trimmed in striated [[zebrano]] veneer. US models also had different bumper rubbers fitted to the more protruding \"park bench\" impact absorbing bumpers. \n\nThe 6.9 lacked expected luxury touches such as power-adjustable outside mirrors or front seats, although a unique power rear seat, heated seats and even orthopedically designed front seats were options. Buyers outside North America could also opt for headlight wipers and washers and/or headlights with a special vacuum-operated linkage whose aim could be adjusted at the dash depending on vehicle load. There was also a new standard feature in 1976: most Mercedes-Benz automobiles that year were equipped with a sophisticated electronic climate control system developed for [[Chrysler Corporation]] for use in their top models. The system turned on the heater, air conditioner or both, depending on the thermostat's setting and ambient temperature, automatically maintaining whatever temperature the driver selected. The compressor was an American import as well, supplied by the Harrison division of [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]].\n\nFar more modern than the contemporary Cadillac, which still had a [[live axle|live rear axle]], and both faster and larger inside than the either the Rolls-Royce or Cadillac, the 6.9 was indistinguishable from its W116 stablemates save for a modest \"6.9\" badge on the decklid and wider tires.<ref name=\"candd77\">{{citation|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/car/archive/mercedes-benz_450sel_6.9-archived_road_test|title=Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9 \u2013 Archived Road Test|author=David E. Davis Jr.|date=July 1977|publisher=Car and Driver}}</ref>  As discreet as the badge was, it could be deleted/ordered with option 261 ''omission of the displacement figure on the trunk lid'' at extra cost for those who wanted to avoid attention either from drivers of other high-performance cars or from law enforcement. In the words of [[David E. Davis]], the 6.9 was \"a $50,000 exercise in going fast.\" \n\nFor fans of the discontinued 6.3 or for those that wanted a car that ''Car and Driver'' proclaimed to be \"the greatest Mercedes-Benz ever built,\" the price was inconsequential. At its launch in 1975, the 450 SEL 6.9 cost [[German mark|DM]] 69,930. In the last year of production, and by 1979, the price had risen DM 81,247. Regardless of the price Mercedes-Benz marketing strategies strategists resulted in a total production of 7,380 units by 1980, and most of these were exported to the USA. This volume is quite respectable considering the overall sales trend of powerful luxury cars following the [[1973 energy crisis]].\n\n===Today===\nIn a poll conducted by Britain's ''Classic & Sports Car'' magazine and printed in their April 1999 edition, the Mercedes-Benz 6.9 ranked fourth on their list of the \"world's greatest [[sedan (car)|saloons]].\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.m-100.cc/6point9/magazines/classicandsportscar_0499/index.html|title=Classic & Sports Car, April 1997 \u2013 Best Saloons Ever|work=m-100.cc|access-date=2013-06-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129191324/http://www.m-100.cc/6point9/magazines/classicandsportscar_0499/index.html|archive-date=2018-01-29|url-status=dead}}</ref> The May 2004 edition of another British publication, ''Mercedes Enthusiast'' magazine, ranked the 6.9 number fifteen on their all-time top twenty list of great Mercedes-Benz automobiles. Even with such accolades, a 6.9 is a reasonably priced collectible automobile despite its rarity. The online NADA Used Car Guide lists a top value of US$40,000. At present, the market for cars of this type is somewhat soft, and a prime example can be had for considerably less. As is often the case with older cars that contain exotic engineering and parts unique to that one model, however, running and maintenance costs for a 6.9 can quickly overshadow a low initial purchase price.\n\n===== LeMons Racing =====\nIn September 2013, a 1979 W116 300 SD was campaigned in the [[24 Hours of LeMons]] at Carolina Motorsports Park, where it completed 166 laps at an average speed of 54.8 MPH.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mylaps.com/en/classification/2961871|title=Classification \u2013 details \u2013 MYLAPS Sports Timing|work=mylaps.com}}</ref> It won the highest prize of the event, the Index of Effluency. Other than mild issues relating to brake and tire wear, no mechanical issues were encountered. After numerous modifications to handling, the car was again run in February 2014 at Barber Motorsports park in Birmingham, AL. It placed 44th, but turned 281 laps at an average pace of 59.6 MPH. One of the key advantages of the 300 SD in long distance racing is its exceptional fuel economy on track, where it burns just 2.5 GPH (Roughly 18MPG). In July 2014 it placed first in class at Sebring.

This system prevents the wheels from locking while braking. The system improves steering control during hard braking situations, and to shorten brake distances.\n* Strengthened body structure.  The W116 featured a more stable security passenger cell with a stiffened roof frame structure. High strength roof and door pillars, along with other reinforced zones, provided enhanced vehicle occupant protection.\n* Deformation zones (crumple zones) in the front and rear.\n* A padded dashboard, deformable switches and controls, and a four-spoke steering wheel with impact absorber and broad impact cushion aimed to reduce occupant injury during collisions.\n* The fuel tank was no longer fitted at the rear end, but was now placed above the rear axle for added protection.\n* Wraparound turn signals made it easier to communicate with nearby drivers.\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n\n====General====\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Alder |first=Trevor |title=Mercedes-Benz S-Class Saloons, 1972\u201391: Road Tests & Articles |series= |year=1996 |publisher=Transport Source Books |location=|asin=B005U5LANQ }}\n* {{Barrett-IBG-MB-2}}\n* {{H\u00e4u\u00dfermann-MBS-1952}}\n* {{cite book |last=Hofner |first=Heribert |title=Die S-Klasse von Mercedes-Benz: von der Kultur des Fahrens |trans-title=The S-Class from Mercedes-Benz: from the culture of driving |year=1997 |publisher=Bechterm\u00fcnz Verlag |location=Augsburg |isbn=3-86047-589-4 |language=de}}\n* {{Hofner-Schrader-MBA-2}}\n* {{Kittler-TMB-1}}\n* {{Kittler-TMB-2}}\n* {{Niemann-PvMB}}\n* {{Oswald-MBP-2}}\n* {{R\u00f6cke-GMSK}}\n* {{R\u00f6cke-NGMSK}}\n* {{Schlegelmilch-M-2013}}\n* {{cite book |last=Storz |first=Alexander Franc |title=Mercedes-Benz S-Klasse: Baureihe W 116 |series=Schrader-Typen-Chronik series |year=2010 |publisher=Motorbuch Verlag |location=Stuttgart |isbn=9783613031838 |language=de}}\n* {{Taylor-MB since 1945-3|pages=6\u201322, 61\u201388, 127\u2013129, 133\u2013135, 139\u2013140 }}\n* {{Taylor-MB S-Class}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==== Workshop manuals ====\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Chilton-MCSW 1974-84}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Schauwecker |first1=Steve |last2=Haynes |first2=John H. |title=Mercedes-Benz 350 and 450: 1971 thru 1980 3.5 and 4.5 liter V8: 350 SL, 450 SE, 450 SEL, 450 SL, 450 SLC: series 107 and 116 models with fuel-injected V8 engines and automatic transmissions |series=Haynes Service and Repair Manual Series |year=1987 |publisher=Haynes |location=Sparkford, UK |isbn=0856966983 }}\n* {{cite book |title=Mercedes S-Klasse, Serie 116, ab 1972: 280S/280SE/350SE/450SE/450/SEL |edition= |series=Reparaturanleitung series, Band 1042. |year=2012 |publisher=Verlag Bucheli |location=Zug, Switzerland |isbn=9783716817933 |language=de}}\n* {{cite book |title=Mercedes 280 S / 280 SE / 350 SE / 340 SE / 450 SEL bis Aug 79 |edition= |series=Reparaturanleitung series, Band 267/268. |year=2013 |publisher=Verlag Bucheli |location=Zug, Switzerland |isbn=9783716813317 |language=de}}\n* {{Bentley-MB Technical}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Mercedes-Benz W116}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070401173934/http://www.m-100.cc/ International M-100 Group] \u2014 Factory-authorized site with information on all M-100-powered Mercedes-Benz automobiles, (including technical forums and maintenance information).

This was the first Mercedes saloon to feature the brand new corporate styling theme which was to be continued until 1993 when the 190 was discontinued.

The basic design concept carried through the themes originally introduced on the [[Mercedes-Benz R107|R107]] [[Mercedes-Benz SL-Class|SL-Class]] [[Roadster (automobile)|roadster]], especially the front and rear lights.<ref name=\"w116.org\"/> As for the SL, the W116 received the ridged lamp covers which kept dirt accumulation at bay; this was to remain a Mercedes-Benz design theme into the 21st century.<ref name=KB0516>{{cite journal | ref = MS16 | journal = Klassiska Bilar | title = \u00c5rets vinnare | trans-title = The year's winner | language = Swedish | date = June 2016 | number = 5 | publisher = Bonnier Tidskrifter AB | location = Stockholm, Sweden | page = 40 | first = Mikael | last = Stjerna | volume = 5 }}</ref> The W116 was [[Friedrich Geiger]]'s last design for Mercedes-Benz; his career had started with the [[Mercedes-Benz 500K]] in 1933.\n\nThe car was presented in September 1972. The model range initially included two versions of the M110 engine (Straight-six with 2746&nbsp;cc displacement)\u2014the 280 S (using a Solex carburetor) and the 280 SE (using Bosch D-Jetronic injection), plus the 350 SE, powered by the M116 engine (V8 with 3499&nbsp;cc displacement). After the 1973 Fuel Crisis, a long-wheelbase version of the 280 was added to the lineup.\n\nHalf a year later, in early 1973, two new models powered by the M117 engine (V8 with 4520&nbsp;cc displacement) were added to the range\u2014the 450 SE and the 450 SEL (with a 100&nbsp;mm longer body). The 450 had {{convert|225|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} in most markets, federalized cars offered {{convert|190|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} while Swedish market cars had an [[Exhaust gas recirculation|EGR-valve]] and {{convert|200|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} until 1976.<ref name=KB0516/> The 450s received a plusher interior as well, with velour or leather seats rather than the checkered cloth of the lesser models. The door insides were also of a different design, being pulled up around the windows.<ref name=KBp42>[[#MS16|Stjerna]], p. 42</ref>\n\nThe most notable W116 was the high-performance, limited-production [[Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9|450 SEL 6.9]], which was introduced in 1975. This model boasted by far the largest engine installed in a post-war Mercedes-Benz (and any non-American production automobile) up to that time,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.classicdriver.com/en/article/cars/lap-luxury-mercedes-s-class-w116 |title=In the lap of luxury: The Mercedes S-Class W116 &#124; Classic Driver Magazine |publisher=Classicdriver.com |date=2013-07-11 |accessdate=2016-07-16}}</ref> and also featured [[self-leveling suspension|self-leveling]] [[hydropneumatic suspension]].\n\nThe 300 SD sedan (American market only) had a turbocharged 3.0-litre [[Straight-five engine|inline-five]] [[diesel engine]] developed from the [[Mercedes-Benz C111|C111]] experimental vehicle. \n\nThe 450 SE was named the [[European Car of the Year]] in 1974, even though the W116 range was first introduced at the [[Paris Motor Show]] in the fall of 1972.<ref name=KBp39>[[#MS16|Stjerna]], p. 39</ref> The W116 range became the first production car to use an electronic four-wheel multi-channel [[anti-lock braking system]] (ABS) from [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] as an option from 1978 on.\n\nProduction totaled 473,035 units. The W116 was succeeded by the [[Mercedes-Benz W126|W126]] S-Class in 1979. The W116 was sold throughout Europe, the Americas, Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Australia.\n\n==Models==\n[[File:1978 M110 2.8 Litre 6 cylinder Engine.jpg|thumb|1978 M110 Engine, Twin cam straight 6.

A slight power reduction was a result of this update. In 1978, a series of engine upgrades restored original performance levels with new fuel injection systems. Initially the early models (1973-1974) of the W116 with the Twin Cam inline 6 used the D-[[Jetronic]] fuels injection system with computers and MAP sensor that are both prone to failure after more than 20 years of use. From 1975 onward they used the [[K-Jetronic]] mechanical fuel injection system, a less complicated system that proved to be much more reliable in the long run and injectors cost 6x less than the D-jetronic system. The W116 equipped with the K-Jetronic system, used a cast-iron fuel distributor, which can be prone to rust over time if moisture or water is present in the fuel. This was changed to an alloy fuel distributor in the following model [[W126]] and is not subject to corrosion.\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n!Chassis code\n!Model Years\n!Model\n!Engine\n!No. built<ref name=\"Oswald\">{{cite book |title=Deutsche Autos 1945\u20131990, Band 4 |lang = de | last= Oswald |first=Werner | date =2003 |publisher=Motorbuch Verlag |location=Stuttgart |isbn=3-613-02131-5 |pages=80, 86}}</ref>\n|-\n|W116.020||1973\u20131980||280 S sedan|| 2.8 L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M110 engine|M110]]'' [[Straight-six engine|I6]] || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 122,848\n|-\n|W116.024||1973\u20131980||280 SE sedan|| 2.8 L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M110 engine|M110]]'' I6 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 150,593\n|-\n|W116.025||1974\u20131980|| 280 SEL sedan|| 2.8 L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M110 engine|M110]]'' I6 || style=\"text-align:right;\"|7,032\n|-\n|W116.028||1973\u20131980|| 350 SE sedan|| 3.5 L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M116 engine|M116]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]] || style=\"text-align:right;\"|51,100\n|-\n|W116.029||1973\u20131980|| 350 SEL sedan|| 3.5 L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M116 engine|M116]]'' V8 || style=\"text-align:right;\"|4,266\n|-\n|W116.032  ||1973\u20131980|| 450 SE sedan|| 4.5 L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M117 engine|M117]]'' V8 || style=\"text-align:right;\"|41,604\n|-\n|W116.033  ||1973\u20131980|| 450 SEL sedan|| 4.5 L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M117 engine|M117]]'' V8 || style=\"text-align:right;\"|59,578\n|-\n|W116.036||1975\u20131980|| [[Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9|450 SEL 6.9]] || 6.9 L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M100 engine|M100]]'' V8 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 7,380\n|-\n|W116.120||1978\u20131980|| 300 SD sedan||  3.0 L [[Mercedes-Benz OM617 engine|OM617]] [[Straight-five engine|I5]] [[turbodiesel]] <br/> (United States and Canada only) || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 28,634\n|}\n\n=={{anchor|6.9}}450 SEL 6.9==\n{{main article|Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9}}\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1 = 450SELI 0411.jpg\n| image2 = Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9 US.jpg\n| caption2 = US market 450 SEL 6.9\n}}\n\nThe high-performance 450 SEL 6.9 version of the [[Mercedes-Benz S-Klasse|S-Class]] was built on its own assembly line by [[Daimler-Benz]] in [[Stuttgart]], Germany and based on the long-wheelbase version of the W116 chassis. The model was generally referred to in the company's literature as the \"6.9\", to separate it from the regular 450 SEL.\n\nThe 6.9 was first shown to the motoring press at the [[Geneva Auto Show#1974|Geneva Auto Show]] in 1974, and produced between 1975 and 1981 in extremely limited numbers. It was billed as the flagship of the Mercedes-Benz car line, and the successor to [[Mercedes-Benz]]'s original high-performance sedan, the [[Mercedes-Benz 300SEL 6.3|300 SEL 6.3]]. The 6.9's successor\u2014the top of range [[Mercedes-Benz W126|500 SEL]]\u2014continued the 6.9's remarkable [[self-levelling suspension|self-leveling]] [[hydropneumatic]] suspension as an extra-cost option.\n\n===Special features===\nThe 6.9 was the first Mercedes-Benz to be fitted with the [[hydropneumatic]] [[self-levelling suspension]] system introduced by [[Citro\u00ebn]] in 1954, unlike the 600 and 6.3 which employed [[air suspension]]s. Using a combination of fluid-filled struts and nitrogen-filled pressure vessels or \"[[hydraulic accumulator|accumulators]]\" in lieu of conventional [[shock absorber]]s and springs, the system was pressurized by a hydraulic pump driven by the engine's timing chain. Compared to the new Mercedes-Benz system, Citro\u00ebn's was belt-driven, exactly like a conventional power steering pump; failure of the Citro\u00ebn system thus might result in loss of suspension. Conversely, every unit of the 6.9 was shipped with hard rubber emergency dampers that served as temporary springs and allowed the car to be driven in the event of a hydraulic failure. The special [[hydraulic fluid]] required by the system was stored in a tank inside the engine compartment. Not only was the system totally self-adjusting, [[ride height]] could be altered by a dash-mounted push-pull knob under the speedometer that raised the car an additional two inches (50&nbsp;mm) for increased ground clearance.\n\nThe suspension system gave the {{convert|4200|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} car the benefits of a both a [[ride quality|smooth ride]] and [[car handling|handling]] that allowed it, in the words of automotive journalist [[David E. Davis]], to be \"tossed about like a [[Mini]].\" The car also featured a model W3B 050 three-speed [[automatic transmission]] unique to the 6.9 and a standard ZF [[limited slip differential]] both for enhanced [[roadholding]] performance on dry pavement and enhanced [[traction (engineering)|traction]] in inclement weather.\n\nFour-wheel [[disc brake]]s and four-wheel independent suspension were standard on these top-of-the-line models. The [[Mercedes-Benz M100 engine|M100 engine]] is a [[cast iron]] [[V8 engine|V8]] with single overhead camshafts which was a bigger version of the engine also used in the [[Mercedes-Benz 600]] and the [[Mercedes-Benz 300SEL 6.3]]. Notable is the Bosch [[K-jetronic|K-Jetronic]] electromechanical [[fuel injection]], forged crankshaft, connecting rods and pistons, and a \"[[dry sump]]\" engine [[lubrication]] system. As a result, the engine itself had no dipstick for checking the oil level. Rather, the dipstick was attached to the inside of the tank's filler cap (accessible from the engine compartment) and the oil level was checked with the engine running and at [[operating temperature]]. The non-American market trim version of the 6.9&nbsp;[[litre|l]] (6,834&nbsp;cc or 417&nbsp;in\u00b3) power plant was rated at {{convert|286|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and 405&nbsp;lb\u00b7ft (549&nbsp;N\u00b7m) of [[torque]], helping to compensate for the 2.65 to 1 final [[mechanical advantage|drive ratio]] necessary for sustained high-speed cruising. The dry sump system also had the benefit of extending the oil change interval to 12,500 miles (20,000&nbsp;km). This, along with hydraulic valve lifters which required no adjusting and special cylinder head gaskets which eliminated the need for periodic retorquing of the head bolts, made the 6.9 relatively easy to maintain and service for its first 50,000 miles (80,500&nbsp;km). The 6.9 required little basic service other than coolant, minor tune-ups, oil changes, and replacement of the air, fuel, oil and power steering filters.\n\n===Performance===\nTop speed was factory-rated at 140&nbsp;mph (225&nbsp;km/h), but some journalists testing the car saw speeds approaching 150&nbsp;mph (241&nbsp;km/h). Among those journalists was [[Brock Yates]]. Yates was approached by the factory to write promotional literature about the 6.9 for advertising purposes. He agreed under the condition that he could list the car's faults as well as its positives and create a genuine extensive review. Daimler-Benz agreed in turn, and Yates was given an American-market spec 6.9 to drive from [[Manhattan]] to the [[Road Atlanta]] grand prix race track in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. There, Yates would drive the car in as-arrived condition at racing speeds for a full 40 laps or just over 100 miles (160&nbsp;km). His complaint on this long drive on public roads was that the magnetic CB antenna blew off at 130 miles per hour. The only change made to the car upon its arrival at Road Atlanta was an adjustment of tire pressure. Driving 40 laps was a difficult task for the street-legal full size luxury sedan primarily designed and geared for comfortable [[Autobahn]] cruising. The 6.9 suffered no major mechanical problems and averaged a respectable 72&nbsp;mph (116&nbsp;km/h) throughout the test, completing it with little more than excess dust on the bodywork from the [[Michelin]] [[radial tyre|radial]] street tires on which the car was driven to Atlanta. Yates was so comfortable driving the 6.9 around the track that he reported having run at least one lap with the sunroof open and the radio on, but the high price of the car made him think better of such risky driving and he finished the test with the radio off and both hands on the wheel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.m-100.cc/6point9/brochure/brockyates/index.html|title=6.9 Brochure \u2013 Brock Yates Story|work=m-100.cc}}</ref>\n\n===Price and interior features===\n[[File:450SEL6.9 dash.jpg|thumb|Interior]]\n\nAll of this technology came at a very high price. At a time when the most expensive [[Cadillac (automobile)|Cadillac]]s, the mid-sized [[Cadillac Seville|Seville]] and [[full-size]]d [[Cadillac Fleetwood]] [[Cadillac Series 70#1971\u20131976|Series Seventy-Five]] [[limousine]] each listed for about US$16,000, the 6.9 listed for around $40,000, more than the Big Three but less than most [[Rolls-Royce car|Rolls-Royce]]s. When the car was officially introduced into the North American market for the 1977 model year, the price was well past $40,000 and was $52,995 by the end of production. Though the 6.9 was undeniably a luxury car, the decor was rather austere compared to the sheer opulence available in a Rolls-Royce or full-sized Cadillac. The interior was identical to that in the less expensive models except for the push-pull suspension control knob just under the speedometer, a low suspension pressure warning and height adjustment indicator lights in the instrument cluster, and wood trim finished in burled [[walnut]] veneer on the dash and console. The rest of the W116 lineup was trimmed in striated [[zebrano]] veneer.\n\nThe 6.9 lacked expected luxury touches such as power-adjustable outside mirrors or front seats, although a unique power rear seat, heated seats and even orthopedically designed front seats were options. Buyers outside North America could also opt for headlight wipers and washers and/or headlights with a special vacuum-operated linkage whose aim could be adjusted at the dash depending on vehicle load. There was also a new standard feature in 1976: most Mercedes-Benz automobiles that year were equipped with a sophisticated electronic climate control system developed for [[Chrysler Corporation]] for use in their top models. The system turned on the heater, air conditioner or both, depending on the thermostat's setting and ambient temperature, automatically maintaining whatever temperature the driver selected. The compressor was an American import as well, supplied by the Harrison division of [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]].\n\nFar more modern than the contemporary Cadillac, which still had a [[live axle|live rear axle]], and both faster and larger inside than the either the Rolls-Royce or Cadillac, the 6.9 was indistinguishable from its W116 stablemates save for a modest \"6.9\" badge on the decklid and wider tires.<ref name=\"candd77\">{{citation|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/car/archive/mercedes-benz_450sel_6.9-archived_road_test|title=Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9 \u2013 Archived Road Test|author=David E. Davis Jr.|date=July 1977|publisher=Car and Driver}}</ref> US models also had different bumper rubbers fitted to the more protruding \"park bench\" impact absorbing bumpers. As discreet as the badge was, it could be deleted/ordered with option 261 ''omission of the displacement figure on the trunk lid'' at extra cost for those who wanted to avoid attention either from drivers of other high-performance cars or from law enforcement. In the words of [[David E. Davis]], the 6.9 was \"a $50,000 exercise in going fast.\"\n\nStill, for fans of the discontinued 6.3 or for those who simply had to have a car which ''Car and Driver'' proclaimed to be \"the greatest Mercedes-Benz ever built,\" it seemed that money was no object. At its launch in 1975, the 450 SEL 6.9 cost [[German mark|DM]] 69,930. In the last year of production, 1979, the car was available at a price of DM 81,247. Even though this was far from inexpensive, the courage of the Mercedes-Benz strategists in launching the car onto the market paid off. A total of 7,380 units were built by 1980, and most of these were exported to the USA. This volume is quite respectable considering the overall sales trend of powerful luxury cars following the [[1973 energy crisis]].\n\n===Today===\nIn a poll conducted by Britain's ''Classic & Sports Car'' magazine and printed in their April 1999 edition, the Mercedes-Benz 6.9 ranked fourth on their list of the \"world's greatest [[sedan (car)|saloons]].\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.m-100.cc/6point9/magazines/classicandsportscar_0499/index.html|title=Classic & Sports Car, April 1997 \u2013 Best Saloons Ever|work=m-100.cc|access-date=2013-06-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129191324/http://www.m-100.cc/6point9/magazines/classicandsportscar_0499/index.html|archive-date=2018-01-29|url-status=dead}}</ref> The May 2004 edition of another British publication, ''Mercedes Enthusiast'' magazine, ranked the 6.9 number fifteen on their all-time top twenty list of great Mercedes-Benz automobiles. Even with such accolades, a 6.9 is a reasonably priced collectible automobile despite its rarity. The online NADA Used Car Guide lists a top value of US$40,000. At present, the market for cars of this type is somewhat soft, and a prime example can be had for considerably less. As is often the case with older cars that contain exotic engineering and parts unique to that one model, however, running and maintenance costs for a 6.9 can quickly overshadow a low initial purchase price.\n\n===== LeMons Racing =====\nIn September 2013, a 1979 W116 300 SD was campaigned in the [[24 Hours of LeMons]] at Carolina Motorsports Park, where it completed 166 laps at an average speed of 54.8 MPH.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mylaps.com/en/classification/2961871|title=Classification \u2013 details \u2013 MYLAPS Sports Timing|work=mylaps.com}}</ref> It won the highest prize of the event, the Index of Effluency. Other than mild issues relating to brake and tire wear, no mechanical issues were encountered. After numerous modifications to handling, the car was again run in February 2014 at Barber Motorsports park in Birmingham, AL. It placed 44th, but turned 281 laps at an average pace of 59.6 MPH. One of the key advantages of the 300 SD in long distance racing is its exceptional fuel economy on track, where it burns just 2.5 GPH (Roughly 18MPG). In July 2014 it placed first in class at Sebring. It is still active in the series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mylaps.com/en/classification/2879916|title=Classification \u2013 details \u2013 MYLAPS Sports Timing|work=mylaps.com}}</ref>\n\n==Technical data==\nTechnical data Mercedes-Benz W116 <ref name=Oswald4>{{cite book |last=Oswald |first=Werner |authorlink= |title= Deutsche Autos 1945\u20131990, Band 4|year=2001 |publisher=Motorbuch Verlag |location=Stuttgart |isbn=3-613-02131-5}}</ref> (Manufacturer's figures except where stated)\n\n<div class=\"NavContent\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \n! style=\"width:16%;\"|Mercedes-Benz\n! style=\"width:14%;\"|280&nbsp;S <br/> (W116 V28)\n! style=\"width:14%;\"|280&nbsp;SE <br/>(W116 E28)\n! style=\"width:14%;\"|350&nbsp;SE <br/>(W116 E35)\n! style=\"width:14%;\"|450&nbsp;SE <br/>(W116 E45)\n! style=\"width:14%;\"|450&nbsp;SEL 6.9 <br/>(W116 E69)\n! style=\"width:14%;\"|300&nbsp;SD <br/>(W116 D30A)\n|- \n| Chassis code:&nbsp; || style=\"text-align:center;\"|116.020 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| SE: 116.024 <br/> SEL: 116.025 || style=\"text-align:center;\"|SE: 116.028 <br/> SEL: 116.029 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| SE: 116.032 <br/> SEL: 116.033 || style=\"text-align:center;\"|116.036 || style=\"text-align:center;\"|116.120\n|- \n| Produced:&nbsp; || style=\"text-align:center;\"|1972\u20131980 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| SE: 1972 \u2013 1980 <br/> SEL: 1974 \u2212 1980 || style=\"text-align:center;\"|SE: 1972 \u2013 1980 <br/> SEL: 1973 \u2212 1980 || style=\"text-align:center;\"|1972\u20131980 || style=\"text-align:center;\"|1975\u20131980 || style=\"text-align:center;\"|1977\u20131980\n|- \n| Engine:&nbsp; || colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Straight-six engine|6-cylinder-inline engine]] ([[four-stroke]]), front-mounted || colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 90\u00b0 [[V8 engine|8-cylinder-V engine]] ([[four-stroke]]), front-mounted || style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Straight-5|5-cylinder-inline engine]] ([[four-stroke]]), front-mounted \n|- \n| Bore x Stroke:&nbsp; || colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|86&nbsp;mm x 78.8&nbsp;mm || style=\"text-align:center;\"|92&nbsp;mm x 65.8&nbsp;mm || style=\"text-align:center;\"|92&nbsp;mm x 85&nbsp;mm || style=\"text-align:center;\"|107&nbsp;mm x 95&nbsp;mm || style=\"text-align:center;\"|90.9&nbsp;mm x 92.4&nbsp;mm\n|- \n| Displacement:&nbsp; || colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2746 cc || style=\"text-align:center;\"|3499 cc || style=\"text-align:center;\"|4520 cc || style=\"text-align:center;\"|6834 cc || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 3005 cc before 1979<br>2998 cc after 1979\n|- \n| Engine code:&nbsp; || style=\"text-align:center;\"|M110.922 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| D-Jet: M110.983 <br/> K-Jet: M110.985 || style=\"text-align:center;\"|D-Jet: M116.983 <br/> K-Jet: M116.985 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| D-Jet: M117.983 <br/> K-Jet: M117.986 || style=\"text-align:center;\"|M100.985 || style=\"text-align:center;\"|OM617.950\n|- \n| Max.

The W116 featured a more stable security passenger cell with a stiffened roof frame structure. High strength roof and door pillars, along with other reinforced zones, provided enhanced vehicle occupant protection.\n* Deformation zones (crumple zones) in the front and rear.\n* A padded dashboard, deformable switches and controls, and a four-spoke steering wheel with impact absorber and broad impact cushion aimed to reduce occupant injury during collisions.\n* The fuel tank was no longer fitted at the rear end, but was now placed above the rear axle for added protection.\n* Wraparound turn signals made it easier to communicate with nearby drivers.\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n\n====General====\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Alder |first=Trevor |title=Mercedes-Benz S-Class Saloons, 1972\u201391: Road Tests & Articles |series= |year=1996 |publisher=Transport Source Books |location=|asin=B005U5LANQ }}\n* {{Barrett-IBG-MB-2}}\n* {{H\u00e4u\u00dfermann-MBS-1952}}\n* {{cite book |last=Hofner |first=Heribert |title=Die S-Klasse von Mercedes-Benz: von der Kultur des Fahrens |trans-title=The S-Class from Mercedes-Benz: from the culture of driving |year=1997 |publisher=Bechterm\u00fcnz Verlag |location=Augsburg |isbn=3-86047-589-4 |language=de}}\n* {{Hofner-Schrader-MBA-2}}\n* {{Kittler-TMB-1}}\n* {{Kittler-TMB-2}}\n* {{Niemann-PvMB}}\n* {{Oswald-MBP-2}}\n* {{R\u00f6cke-GMSK}}\n* {{R\u00f6cke-NGMSK}}\n* {{Schlegelmilch-M-2013}}\n* {{cite book |last=Storz |first=Alexander Franc |title=Mercedes-Benz S-Klasse: Baureihe W 116 |series=Schrader-Typen-Chronik series |year=2010 |publisher=Motorbuch Verlag |location=Stuttgart |isbn=9783613031838 |language=de}}\n* {{Taylor-MB since 1945-3|pages=6\u201322, 61\u201388, 127\u2013129, 133\u2013135, 139\u2013140 }}\n* {{Taylor-MB S-Class}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==== Workshop manuals ====\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Chilton-MCSW 1974-84}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Schauwecker |first1=Steve |last2=Haynes |first2=John H. |title=Mercedes-Benz 350 and 450: 1971 thru 1980 3.5 and 4.5 liter V8: 350 SL, 450 SE, 450 SEL, 450 SL, 450 SLC: series 107 and 116 models with fuel-injected V8 engines and automatic transmissions |series=Haynes Service and Repair Manual Series |year=1987 |publisher=Haynes |location=Sparkford, UK |isbn=0856966983 }}\n* {{cite book |title=Mercedes S-Klasse, Serie 116, ab 1972: 280S/280SE/350SE/450SE/450/SEL |edition= |series=Reparaturanleitung series, Band 1042. |year=2012 |publisher=Verlag Bucheli |location=Zug, Switzerland |isbn=9783716817933 |language=de}}\n* {{cite book |title=Mercedes 280 S / 280 SE / 350 SE / 340 SE / 450 SEL bis Aug 79 |edition= |series=Reparaturanleitung series, Band 267/268. |year=2013 |publisher=Verlag Bucheli |location=Zug, Switzerland |isbn=9783716813317 |language=de}}\n* {{Bentley-MB Technical}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Mercedes-Benz W116}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070401173934/http://www.m-100.cc/ International M-100 Group] \u2014 Factory-authorized site with information on all M-100-powered Mercedes-Benz automobiles, (including technical forums and maintenance information).

In Saudi Arabia's case this includes [[amputation]]s of [[hands]] and feet for [[robbery]], and [[flogging]] for lesser crimes such as \"sexual deviance\" and [[drunkenness]].  In the 2000s, it was reported that women were sentenced to lashes for adultery; the women were actually victims of rape, but because they could not prove who the perpetrators were, they were deemed guilty of committing adultery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=3899920|title=Exclusive: Saudi Rape Victim Tells Her Story|author=ABC News|work=ABC News|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref> The number of lashes is not clearly prescribed by law and is varied according to the discretion of judges, and ranges from dozens of lashes to several hundred, usually applied over a period of weeks or months.  In 2004, the [[United Nations Committee Against Torture]] criticized Saudi Arabia over the [[amputations]] and [[flogging]]s it carries out under [[Sharia]]. The Saudi delegation responded defending \"legal [[traditions]]\" held since the inception of Islam 1,400 years ago and rejected interference in its legal system.\n\nThe courts continue to impose sentences of flogging as a principal or additional punishment for many offences. At least five defendants were sentenced to flogging of 1,000 to 2,500 lashes. Flogging was carried out in prisons.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amnestyusa.org/research/reports/annual-report-saudi-arabia-2013?page=3 |title=Annual Report: Saudi Arabia 2013 &#124; Amnesty International USA |publisher=Amnestyusa.org |date=2013-05-23 |accessdate=2015-12-04}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Mazen Abdul-Jawad was sentenced to 1,000 lashes and five years in prison for bragging on a Saudi TV show about his sexual exploits.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/saudiarabia/6269161/Saudi-man-jailed-and-gets-1000-lashes-for-talking-about-sex.html|title=Saudi man jailed and gets 1,000 lashes for talking about sex|date=7 October 2009|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesundaily.my/node/150525|title=Saudi man gets 1,000 lashes and five years for TV sex boasts|website=www.thesundaily.my|access-date=2016-11-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123060151/http://www.thesundaily.my/node/150525|archive-date=2016-11-23}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Saudi blogger [[Raif Badawi]]'s sentence was increased to 1,000 lashes and ten years' imprisonment after he was accused of [[apostasy]] in 2012.

In 2004, the [[United Nations Committee Against Torture]] criticized Saudi Arabia over the [[amputations]] and [[flogging]]s it carries out under [[Sharia]]. The Saudi delegation responded defending \"legal [[traditions]]\" held since the inception of Islam 1,400 years ago and rejected interference in its legal system.\n\nThe courts continue to impose sentences of flogging as a principal or additional punishment for many offences. At least five defendants were sentenced to flogging of 1,000 to 2,500 lashes.

Originally the term referred only to [[musket]]s that had been produced as a [[smoothbore]] weapon and later had their [[Gun barrel|barrels]] replaced with [[Rifling|rifled]] barrels. The term later included rifles that directly replaced, and were of the same design overall as, a particular model of smoothbore musket.\n\n==History and development==\nIn the early 19th century, there were [[rifle]]s, and there were [[musket]]s. Muskets were smoothbore [[Muzzleloader|muzzle-loading]] weapons, firing round lead balls or [[buck and ball]] ammunition, that were also designed to accept a [[bayonet]]. Rifles were similar in that they used the same kind of [[flintlock]] or [[caplock]] firing mechanism, but the main difference was that their barrels were rifled &ndash; that is, their barrels had grooves cut into the interior surface which would cause the bullet to spin as it left the barrel.\n\nRifles have the advantage of long range accuracy, because spinning bullets have far flatter and more stable trajectories than balls fired from smoothbore muskets. Muskets had the advantage of a faster rate of fire. A muzzle-loaded weapon required the bullet to fit snugly into the barrel. For a smoothbore weapon this can be a somewhat loose fit, but in the case of a rifle, the helical rifling lands in the barrel have to cut into the bullet to make it spin. The fit needs to be sufficiently tight for the bullet to engage the lands in order to impart spin; otherwise the bullet will wobble as it goes down the barrel, destroying its accuracy. Furthermore, if the barrel-to-bullet seal is not tight, gases will blow through the rifling grooves and around the bullet, compromising muzzle velocity, accuracy and the bullet's [[Terminal ballistics|terminal energy]] at the target. Their greater accuracy and range made rifles ideal for hunting, but the slower rate of fire was a significant impediment for widespread military use, along with the [[fouling]] caused by normal firing which made them steadily more difficult to load.\n\nThe smooth-bore musket was the main weapon of the line infantry and light infantry, and rifles were used only by snipers and other specialist troops. All muskets were supplied with bayonets, which allowed them to be used in melee combat.  At the time, the Russian and French armies actively used light infantry (rangers and voltigeurs), and sometimes scattered whole infantry battalions as skirmishers to fight long-term on rough terrain.<ref>http://www.museum.ru/museum/1812/Library/Borodino_conf/2006/Celorungo.pdf</ref> Although rifles had better shooting accuracy than smoothbore muskets, their effective fire range was the same. For example, in the British Army, light infantrymen armed with ordinary muskets were trained for 300\u2013400 yards.<ref>https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28260455-british-light-infantry-rifle-tactics-of-the-napoleonic-wars</ref> Since they were used as pikes, muskets tended to be fairly long and heavy weapons. They tended to be about four to six feet in length (six to eight feet including the bayonet), with a weight of around {{convert|10|to|12|lb|kg}}, as longer and heavier weapons were found to be too unwieldy.<ref>{{cite book |title=The evolution of weapons and warfare |authorlink=Trevor Nevitt Dupuy |first=Trevor Nevitt |last=Dupuy |publisher=[[Da Capo Press]] |date=March 21, 1990}}</ref> The length of a musket also allowed them to be fired by ranks, minimizing the risk that the men in the rear ranks would accidentally shoot the men in the front ranks in the back of the head, or, more likely, scorch their faces and burst their eardrums with the muzzle blast. Muskets six feet in length could be fired in three ranks without fear of accidents.<ref>{{cite book\n |title=Rifles and rifle practice: an elementary treatise upon the theory of rifle firing\n |authorlink=Cadmus M. Wilcox |first=Cadmus Marcellus |last=Wilcox |year=1861}}</ref>\n\nThe relative inaccuracy and short range of the musket was not considered to be significant on the battlefield, because smoke from the [[black powder]] used at the time quickly obscured the battlefield and rendered the longer range of the rifle useless, especially as a battle progressed.<ref>{{cite book\n |title=Civil War Firearms: Their Historical Background and Tactical Use\n <!-- |authorlink=Joseph G. Bilby --> |year=1996 |first=Joseph G. |last=Bilby}}</ref> \n\nRifles were more expensive to make than muskets, and were typically used by small units of specialized riflemen trained not to fight in closed ranks, but in open order, spread out as [[skirmisher]]s or [[sharpshooter]]s. Since they were not fired over other men\u2019s shoulders or designed for close-combat bayonet fighting, military rifles could be much shorter than muskets, which also made loading from the muzzle easier and reduced the difficulties associated with fitting the bullet into the barrel, although the rate of fire was still slower than that of a musket. \n\n[[Image:Minie Balls.jpg|thumb|right|Various rifled musket projectiles]]\nThe problem of slow loading of rifles caused by barrel fouling was solved by the [[Mini\u00e9 ball]], which was invented in the 1840s by French inventor [[Claude-\u00c9tienne Mini\u00e9]]. Despite its name, the Mini\u00e9 ball was not a round ball at all \u2013 it was long and conical, with an expanding skirt at the rear of the bullet.  The skirt allowed the mini\u00e9 ball to be smaller than the barrel's bore, so it would slip in as easily as the ball of a smoothbore.   When the weapon was fired, the skirt expanded to fit tightly against the inside of the rifle barrel, with less energy wasted in blow-by around the projectile and insuring that the rifling lands and grooves would impart a stabilizing spin to the mini\u00e9 ball.<ref>{{cite book |year=2002 |lccn=2002014682 |isbn=1576072681 |location=[[Santa Barbara, California]]\n |title=Guns in American Society: An Encyclopedia of History, Politics, Culture, and the Law\n <!-- |authorlink=Gregg Lee Carter --> |first=Gregg Lee |last=Carter |publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1840s and 1850s, many smoothbore muskets had their barrels replaced with similar barrels that were rifled so that they could fire the new bullet. These \"rifled muskets\" or \"rifle muskets\" were long enough to serve the function of muskets in close formations of line and square, were as quick to load as the old muskets and as easy to use with minimal training. Yet the [[Mini\u00e9 rifle|Mini\u00e9-type]] rifled muskets were much more accurate than smoothbore muskets. Tests of a rifled musket firing Mini\u00e9 ball, and a smoothbore musket firing round ball, at various ranges against a 10 by 10 inches (25 cm \u00d7 25 cm) target, showed much higher accuracy for the rifled musket.<ref>Claud E. Fuller, ''The Rifled Musket''</ref> From a smooth-bore musket, from 42% to 48% of bullets hit the target at a distance of 200 yards. At a distance of 300 yards, 18% of the bullets hit the target. For a rifle, the results were much better. From a rifle, 46% to 58% of bullets hit the target at a distance of 300 yards; 24% to 42% at 500 yards.<ref>Justin Stanage (2002).

Nevertheless, the musket was still a formidable force on the battlefield. At the beginning of the American Civil War, some infantry regiments chose to keep smooth-bore muskets, preferring them because they could shoot \"ball and buck\".<ref>Davide Pedersoli.

The term was only used for weapons that directly replaced smoothbore muskets. For example, the [[Springfield Model 1861]] with its typical musket style lock mechanism and long barrel length was called a \"rifled musket\". In contrast, the [[Henry Rifle]] produced in the same time period did not replace a musket and did not have other musket-like characteristics, and was just referred to as a \"rifle\". {{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nIn the late 1860s, rifled muskets were replaced by [[Breech-loading weapon|breech-loading]] rifles. Weapons like the [[Springfield Model 1868]] were produced by simply changing out the lock mechanism of a rifled musket. However, once this change was made, the weapon was no longer referred to as a rifled-musket and was instead referred to as simply a \"rifle\".\n\n==Characteristics of rifled muskets==\nIn general, rifle muskets were the same length as the smoothbore muskets they replaced. This meant that they typically had a barrel length of about {{convert|40|in|cm}} and an overall length of about {{convert|55|to|60|in|cm}}. Period U.S. Armory nomenclature described rifles and rifle-muskets as newly made firearms specifically designed and manufactured with rifling. Rifled muskets were smoothbore firearms returned to the armory or contractors for rifling.  Considerable numbers of armory-stored smoothbores were converted in this way in the 1850s upon adoption of the Mini\u00e9 ball as the standard projectile.  Rifle muskets tended to be of smaller caliber than their smoothbore predecessors, for example, the .58 caliber U.S. [[Springfield Model 1855]] or the .577 caliber British [[Pattern 1853 Enfield]]. Tests conducted by the U.S. Army in the mid-1850s showed that the smaller caliber was more accurate at longer ranges. The cylindro-conical shape of the Mini\u00e9 ball also meant that the smaller-diameter but longer .58 caliber Mini\u00e9 ball had roughly the same amount of lead and weight as the larger .69 round ball. While the caliber was reduced, the overall length of the barrel was not. Shorter rifles could have easily been made (and were made for specific branches or arms such as [[mounted infantry]] and [[Rifleman|riflemen]]) that would have been more accurate than the smoothbore muskets they replaced, but military commanders still used tactics like firing by ranks, and feared that with a shorter weapon the soldiers in the rear ranks might accidentally shoot the front rank soldiers in the back of the head. Military commanders at the time also believed that bayonet fighting would continue to be important in battles, which also influenced the decision to retain existing barrel lengths.\n\nIn the US and British service standardized infantry firearms were produced in a longer \"rifle musket\" version and a shorter \"rifle\" version, such as the Springfield Model 1855. The rifle musket version had a 40-inch barrel and an overall length of {{convert|56|in|cm}}. The rifle version had a {{convert|33|in|cm|adj=on}} barrel and an overall length of {{convert|49|in|cm}}.<ref>{{cite book\n |location=[[St. Paul, Minnesota]] |lccn=2006284543 |isbn=9781853676925\n |title=The Guns That Won the West: Firearms on the American Frontier, 1848\u20131898\n <!-- |authorlink=John Walter born 1951--> |first=John |last=Walter\n |publisher=[[MBI Publishing Company]] |year=2006}}</ref> In the British forces the distinction was retained between the full-length musket issued to the infantry as a whole, and the shorter and handier version of the Enfield produced for specialist rifle regiments and marines. The long version had the barrel held to the stock by three metal bands, while the shorter version needed just two, so they are referred to as \u201c3-band\u201d and \u201c2-band\u201d Enfields respectively.\n\nRifle muskets typically used [[percussion lock]] systems, with some exceptions like the Springfield Model 1855, which also was equipped with the [[Maynard tape primer]] system.\n\nSince rifle muskets were meant as a direct replacement for smoothbore muskets, they were fitted with bayonets. Their designers envisioned that they would be used in battle much like the bayonets on older smoothbore muskets. However, in practice, the longer range of the rifle musket and changes in tactics rendered the bayonet almost obsolete. During the U.S. Civil War, bayonets accounted for less than one percent of battlefield casualties.\n\nIn military use, rifle musket loading was simplified somewhat through the use of [[paper cartridge]]s, which were significantly different from modern [[Cartridge (firearms)|metallic cartridge]]s. They typically consisted of rolled-up tubes of paper containing a premeasured amount of black powder and a greased Mini\u00e9 ball. Unlike the smoothbore cartridge, the entire cartridge was not simply shoved into the weapon. Instead, the paper was torn open (typically by the shooter's teeth), the powder was poured down the barrel, the Mini\u00e9 ball was placed into the barrel and rammed down on top of the powder with the [[ramrod]].  The paper was discarded. Also differing from a modern cartridge, a separate [[percussion cap]] had to be placed onto the percussion lock's cone before the weapon could be fired. The Maynard tape primer system attempted to speed up this last step by using paper strips similar to those used in modern toy [[cap gun]]s in place of the percussion cap, but this proved to be unreliable in field service and was abandoned on later weapons.\n\nAn exception to this method is the Enfield rifle-musket cartridge.  There were no lubrication rings moulded or swaged into the Enfield projectile. The projectile was inserted upside down in the cartridge and the outside of the cartridge paper was greased at the projectile end and intended to be inserted and used as a paper patch. A ramrod was used to fully seat the round.\n\n==Use in battle==\nRifled muskets were heavily used in the [[American Civil War]]. The American-made [[Springfield Model 1861]] was the most widely used weapon in the war, followed by the British [[Pattern 1853 Enfield]].  The [[Lorenz rifle]] was the third most used rifle during the Civil War<ref>Thomas Dean, and Earl J. Coates (1996). ''An Introduction to Civil War Small Arms''</ref>\n\nThe Enfield was also used in the [[Crimean War]] where its greater range was a significant advantage over the much shorter-ranged [[Russian Empire|Russian]] smoothbore muskets.\n\nHowever, soldiers armed with rifled muskets were not always successful on the battlefield.  In the [[Second Italian War of Independence|Italian War of 1859]], \n[[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] troops armed with rifled muskets were defeated by [[Second French Empire|French]] forces using aggressive skirmishing tactics and rapid bayonet assaults at close range.<ref>{{cite book\n |title=War in the Age of Technology: Myriad Faces of Modern Armed Conflict\n <!-- |authorlink1=Geoffrey Jensen --> |first1=Geoffrey |last1=Jensen\n <!-- |authorlink2=Andrew Wiest --> |first2=Andrew |last2=Wiest |publisher=[[NYU Press]] |year=2001}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Muzzle-loading rifle]]\n*[[Springfield rifle]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.enfield-snider.com/Home.htm The Enfield Pattern 1853 through to its culmination as the Snider MkIII]\n* [http://www.svartkrutt.net/articles/vis.php?id=5 Rifle Musket and Mini\u00e9 Ball]\n* [http://www.svartkrutt.net/articles/vis.php?id=2 The Enfield Pattern 1856 Rifle Musket]\n\n[[Category:Rifled muskets| ]]\n", "text_old": "[[Image:Springfield Model 1861 Rifled Musket.jpg|thumb|[[Springfield Model 1861]] Rifle Musket]]\n[[Image:Pattern1853Rifle.jpg|thumb|[[Pattern 1853 Enfield]] Rifle Musket]]\n\nA '''rifled musket''', '''rifle musket''', or '''rifle-musket''' is a type of firearm made in the mid-19th century.

Furthermore, if the barrel-to-bullet seal is not tight, gases will blow through the rifling grooves and around the bullet, compromising muzzle velocity, accuracy and the bullet's [[Terminal ballistics|terminal energy]] at the target. Their greater accuracy and range made rifles ideal for hunting, but the slower rate of fire was a significant impediment for widespread military use, along with the [[fouling]] caused by normal firing which made them steadily more difficult to load.\n\nThe smooth-bore musket was the main weapon of the line infantry and light infantry, and rifles were used only by snipers and other specialist troops. All muskets were supplied with bayonets, which allowed them to be used in melee combat.  At the time, the Russian and French armies actively used light infantry (rangers and voltigeurs), and sometimes scattered whole infantry battalions as skirmishers to fight long-term on rough terrain.<ref>http://www.museum.ru/museum/1812/Library/Borodino_conf/2006/Celorungo.pdf</ref> Although rifles had better shooting accuracy than smoothbore muskets, their effective fire range was the same. For example, in the British Army, light infantrymen armed with ordinary muskets were trained for 300-400 yards.<ref>https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28260455-british-light-infantry-rifle-tactics-of-the-napoleonic-wars</ref> Since they were used as pikes, muskets tended to be fairly long and heavy weapons. They tended to be about four to six feet in length (six to eight feet including the bayonet), with a weight of around {{convert|10|to|12|lb|kg}}, as longer and heavier weapons were found to be too unwieldy.<ref>{{cite book |title=The evolution of weapons and warfare |authorlink=Trevor Nevitt Dupuy |first=Trevor Nevitt |last=Dupuy |publisher=[[Da Capo Press]] |date=March 21, 1990}}</ref> The length of a musket also allowed them to be fired by ranks, minimizing the risk that the men in the rear ranks would accidentally shoot the men in the front ranks in the back of the head, or, more likely, scorch their faces and burst their eardrums with the muzzle blast. Muskets six feet in length could be fired in three ranks without fear of accidents.<ref>{{cite book\n |title=Rifles and rifle practice: an elementary treatise upon the theory of rifle firing\n |authorlink=Cadmus M. Wilcox |first=Cadmus Marcellus |last=Wilcox |year=1861}}</ref>\n\nThe relative inaccuracy and short range of the musket was not considered to be significant on the battlefield, because smoke from the [[black powder]] used at the time quickly obscured the battlefield and rendered the longer range of the rifle useless, especially as a battle progressed.<ref>{{cite book\n |title=Civil War Firearms: Their Historical Background and Tactical Use\n <!-- |authorlink=Joseph G. Bilby --> |year=1996 |first=Joseph G. |last=Bilby}}</ref> \n\nRifles were more expensive to make than muskets, and were typically used by small units of specialized riflemen trained not to fight in closed ranks, but in open order, spread out as [[skirmisher]]s or [[sharpshooter]]s. Since they were not fired over other men\u2019s shoulders or designed for close-combat bayonet fighting, military rifles could be much shorter than muskets, which also made loading from the muzzle easier and reduced the difficulties associated with fitting the bullet into the barrel, although the rate of fire was still slower than that of a musket. \n\n[[Image:Minie Balls.jpg|thumb|right|Various rifled musket projectiles]]\nThe problem of slow loading of rifles caused by barrel fouling was solved by the [[Mini\u00e9 ball]], which was invented in the 1840s by French inventor [[Claude-\u00c9tienne Mini\u00e9]]. Despite its name, the Mini\u00e9 ball was not a round ball at all - it was long and conical, with an expanding skirt at the rear of the bullet.  The skirt allowed the mini\u00e9 ball to be smaller than the barrel's bore, so it would slip in as easily as the ball of a smoothbore.   When the weapon was fired, the skirt expanded to fit tightly against the inside of the rifle barrel, with less energy wasted in blow-by around the projectile and insuring that the rifling lands and grooves would impart a stabilizing spin to the mini\u00e9 ball.<ref>{{cite book |year=2002 |lccn=2002014682 |isbn=1576072681 |location=[[Santa Barbara, California]]\n |title=Guns in American Society: An Encyclopedia of History, Politics, Culture, and the Law\n <!-- |authorlink=Gregg Lee Carter --> |first=Gregg Lee |last=Carter |publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1840s and 1850s, many smoothbore muskets had their barrels replaced with similar barrels that were rifled so that they could fire the new bullet. These \"rifled muskets\" or \"rifle muskets\" were long enough to serve the function of muskets in close formations of line and square, were as quick to load as the old muskets and as easy to use with minimal training. Yet the [[Mini\u00e9 rifle|Mini\u00e9-type]] rifled muskets were much more accurate than smoothbore muskets. Tests of a rifled musket firing Mini\u00e9 ball, and a smoothbore musket firing round ball, at various ranges against a 10 by 10 inches (25 cm \u00d7 25 cm) target, showed much higher accuracy for the rifled musket.<ref>Claud E. Fuller, ''The Rifled Musket''</ref> From a smooth-bore musket, from 42% to 48% of bullets hit the target at a distance of 200 yards. At a distance of 300 yards, 18% of the bullets hit the target. For a rifle, the results were much better. From a rifle, 46% to 58% of bullets hit the target at a distance of 300 yards; 24% to 42% at 500 yards.<ref>Justin Stanage (2002).

Nevertheless, the musket was still a formidable force on the battlefield. At the beginning of the American Civil War, some infantry regiments chose to keep smooth-bore muskets, preferring them because they could shoot \"ball and buck\".<ref>Davide Pedersoli.

The term was only used for weapons that directly replaced smoothbore muskets. For example, the [[Springfield Model 1861]] with its typical musket style lock mechanism and long barrel length was called a \"rifled musket\". In contrast, the [[Henry Rifle]] produced in the same time period did not replace a musket and did not have other musket-like characteristics, and was just referred to as a \"rifle\". {{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nIn the late 1860s, rifled muskets were replaced by [[Breech-loading weapon|breech-loading]] rifles. Weapons like the [[Springfield Model 1868]] were produced by simply changing out the lock mechanism of a rifled musket. However, once this change was made, the weapon was no longer referred to as a rifled-musket and was instead referred to as simply a \"rifle\".\n\n==Characteristics of rifled muskets==\nIn general, rifle muskets were the same length as the smoothbore muskets they replaced. This meant that they typically had a barrel length of about {{convert|40|in|cm}} and an overall length of about {{convert|55|to|60|in|cm}}. Period U.S. Armory nomenclature described rifles and rifle-muskets as newly made firearms specifically designed and manufactured with rifling. Rifled muskets were smoothbore firearms returned to the armory or contractors for rifling.  Considerable numbers of armory-stored smoothbores were converted in this way in the 1850s upon adoption of the Mini\u00e9 ball as the standard projectile.  Rifle muskets tended to be of smaller caliber than their smoothbore predecessors, for example, the .58 caliber U.S. [[Springfield Model 1855]] or the .577 caliber British [[Pattern 1853 Enfield]]. Tests conducted by the U.S. Army in the mid-1850s showed that the smaller caliber was more accurate at longer ranges. The cylindro-conical shape of the Mini\u00e9 ball also meant that the smaller-diameter but longer .58 caliber Mini\u00e9 ball had roughly the same amount of lead and weight as the larger .69 round ball. While the caliber was reduced, the overall length of the barrel was not. Shorter rifles could have easily been made (and were made for specific branches or arms such as [[mounted infantry]] and [[Rifleman|riflemen]]) that would have been more accurate than the smoothbore muskets they replaced, but military commanders still used tactics like firing by ranks, and feared that with a shorter weapon the soldiers in the rear ranks might accidentally shoot the front rank soldiers in the back of the head. Military commanders at the time also believed that bayonet fighting would continue to be important in battles, which also influenced the decision to retain existing barrel lengths.\n\nIn the US and British service standardized infantry firearms were produced in a longer \"rifle musket\" version and a shorter \"rifle\" version, such as the Springfield Model 1855. The rifle musket version had a 40-inch barrel and an overall length of {{convert|56|in|cm}}. The rifle version had a {{convert|33|in|cm|adj=on}} barrel and an overall length of {{convert|49|in|cm}}.<ref>{{cite book\n |location=[[St. Paul, Minnesota]] |lccn=2006284543 |isbn=9781853676925\n |title=The Guns That Won the West: Firearms on the American Frontier, 1848\u20131898\n <!-- |authorlink=John Walter born 1951--> |first=John |last=Walter\n |publisher=[[MBI Publishing Company]] |year=2006}}</ref> In the British forces the distinction was retained between the full-length musket issued to the infantry as a whole, and the shorter and handier version of the Enfield produced for specialist rifle regiments and marines. The long version had the barrel held to the stock by three metal bands, while the shorter version needed just two, so they are referred to as \u201c3-band\u201d and \u201c2-band\u201d Enfields respectively.\n\nRifle muskets typically used [[percussion lock]] systems, with some exceptions like the Springfield Model 1855, which also was equipped with the [[Maynard tape primer]] system.\n\nSince rifle muskets were meant as a direct replacement for smoothbore muskets, they were fitted with bayonets. Their designers envisioned that they would be used in battle much like the bayonets on older smoothbore muskets. However, in practice, the longer range of the rifle musket and changes in tactics rendered the bayonet almost obsolete. During the U.S. Civil War, bayonets accounted for less than one percent of battlefield casualties.\n\nIn military use, rifle musket loading was simplified somewhat through the use of [[paper cartridge]]s, which were significantly different from modern [[Cartridge (firearms)|metallic cartridge]]s. They typically consisted of rolled-up tubes of paper containing a premeasured amount of black powder and a greased Mini\u00e9 ball. Unlike the smoothbore cartridge, the entire cartridge was not simply shoved into the weapon. Instead, the paper was torn open (typically by the shooter's teeth), the powder was poured down the barrel, the Mini\u00e9 ball was placed into the barrel and rammed down on top of the powder with the [[ramrod]].  The paper was discarded. Also differing from a modern cartridge, a separate [[percussion cap]] had to be placed onto the percussion lock's cone before the weapon could be fired. The Maynard tape primer system attempted to speed up this last step by using paper strips similar to those used in modern toy [[cap gun]]s in place of the percussion cap, but this proved to be unreliable in field service and was abandoned on later weapons.\n\nAn exception to this method is the Enfield rifle-musket cartridge.  There were no lubrication rings moulded or swaged into the Enfield projectile. The projectile was inserted upside down in the cartridge and the outside of the cartridge paper was greased at the projectile end and intended to be inserted and used as a paper patch. A ramrod was used to fully seat the round.\n\n==Use in battle==\nRifled muskets were heavily used in the [[American Civil War]]. The American-made [[Springfield Model 1861]] was the most widely used weapon in the war, followed by the British [[Pattern 1853 Enfield]].  The [[Lorenz rifle]] was the third most used rifle during the Civil War<ref>Thomas Dean, and Earl J. Coates (1996). ''An Introduction to Civil War Small Arms''</ref>\n\nThe Enfield was also used in the [[Crimean War]] where its greater range was a significant advantage over the much shorter-ranged [[Russian Empire|Russian]] smoothbore muskets.\n\nHowever, soldiers armed with rifled muskets were not always successful on the battlefield.  In the [[Second Italian War of Independence|Italian War of 1859]], \n[[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] troops armed with rifled muskets were defeated by [[Second French Empire|French]] forces using aggressive skirmishing tactics and rapid bayonet assaults at close range.<ref>{{cite book\n |title=War in the Age of Technology: Myriad Faces of Modern Armed Conflict\n <!-- |authorlink1=Geoffrey Jensen --> |first1=Geoffrey |last1=Jensen\n <!-- |authorlink2=Andrew Wiest --> |first2=Andrew |last2=Wiest |publisher=[[NYU Press]] |year=2001}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Muzzle-loading rifle]]\n*[[Springfield rifle]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.enfield-snider.com/Home.htm The Enfield Pattern 1853 through to its culmination as the Snider MkIII]\n* [http://www.svartkrutt.net/articles/vis.php?id=5 Rifle Musket and Mini\u00e9 Ball]\n* [http://www.svartkrutt.net/articles/vis.php?id=2 The Enfield Pattern 1856 Rifle Musket]\n\n[[Category:Rifled muskets| ]]\n", "name_user": "Srich32977", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifled_musket"}

Clocks aboard an interstellar ship would run slower than Earth clocks, so if a ship's engines were capable of continuously generating around 1&nbsp;g of acceleration (which is comfortable for humans), the ship could reach almost anywhere in the galaxy and return to Earth within 40 years ship-time (see diagram). Upon return, there would be a difference between the time elapsed on the astronaut's ship and the time elapsed on Earth.\n\nFor example, a spaceship could travel to a star 32 light-years away, initially accelerating at a constant 1.03g (i.e., 10.1&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup>) for 1.32 years (ship time), then stopping its engines and coasting for the next 17.3 years (ship time) at a constant speed, then decelerating again for 1.32 ship-years, and coming to a stop at the destination. After a short visit, the astronaut could return to Earth the same way. After the full round-trip, the clocks onboard the ship show that 40 years have passed, but according to those on Earth, the ship comes back 76 years after launch.\n\nFrom the viewpoint of the astronaut, onboard clocks seem to be running normally. The star ahead appears to be approaching at a speed of 0.87 light-years per ship-year. The universe would appear contracted along the direction of travel to half the size it had when the ship was at rest; the distance between that star and the Sun would seem to be 16 light-years as measured by the astronaut.\n\nAt higher speeds, the time on board will run even slower, so the astronaut could travel to the center of the [[Milky Way]] (30,000 light-years from Earth) and back in 40 years ship-time. But the speed according to Earth clocks will always be less than one light-year per Earth year, so, when back home, the astronaut will find that more than 60 thousand years will have passed on Earth.\n\n==== Constant acceleration ====\n{{See also|Space travel using constant acceleration}}\n\n[[File:Roundtriptimes.png|thumb|upright=1.4|This plot shows a ship capable of 1-[[Gravitational acceleration|g]] (10&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup> or about 1.0 ly/y<sup>2</sup>) \"felt\" or proper-acceleration<ref>{{cite web | title= Clock paradox III | url= http://www.eftaylor.com/pub/spacetime/STP1stEdExercP81to100.pdf | access-date= 2014-08-31 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170721192831/http://www.eftaylor.com/pub/spacetime/STP1stEdExercP81to100.pdf | archive-date= 2017-07-21 | url-status= dead }} {{cite book | author1= Taylor, Edwin F. | author2= Wheeler, John Archibald | date= 1966 | title= Spacetime Physics | chapter-url= https://archive.org/details/spacetimephysics0000tayl | chapter-url-access= registration | publisher= W.H.

A constant acceleration journey is one where the propulsion system accelerates the ship at a continuous rate for the first half of the trip, and then decelerates for the second half, so that it arrives at the destination stationary relative to where it began.  If this were performed with an acceleration similar to that experienced at the Earth's surface, it would have the added advantage of producing artificial \"gravity\" for the crew. Supplying the energy required, however, would be prohibitively expensive with current technology.<ref>Crowell, Benjamin (2011), Light and Matter Section 4.3</ref>\n\nFrom the perspective of a planetary observer, the ship will appear to accelerate steadily at first, but then more gradually as it approaches the speed of light (which it cannot exceed).

As part of this, distances between objects in the direction of the ship's motion will gradually contract until the ship begins to decelerate, at which time an onboard observer's experience of the gravitational field will be reversed.\n\nWhen the ship reaches its destination, if it were to exchange a message with its origin planet, it would find that less time had elapsed on board than had elapsed for the planetary observer, due to [[time dilation]] and [[length contraction]].\n\nThe result is an impressively fast journey for the crew.\n\n== Propulsion ==\n\n=== Rocket concepts ===\nAll rocket concepts are limited by the [[rocket equation]], which sets the characteristic velocity available as a function of exhaust velocity and mass ratio, the ratio of initial (''M''<sub>0</sub>, including fuel) to final (''M''<sub>1</sub>, fuel depleted) mass.\n\nVery high [[Power-to-weight ratio|specific power]], the ratio of thrust to total vehicle mass, is required to reach interstellar targets within sub-century time-frames.<ref>{{cite journal | title= VISTA \u2013 A Vehicle for Interplanetary Space Transport Application Powered by Inertial Confinement Fusion | author= Orth, C.

In an ion engine, electric power is used to create charged particles of the fuel, usually the gas xenon, and accelerate them to extremely high velocities. The exhaust velocity of conventional rockets is limited by the chemical energy stored in the fuel's molecular bonds, which limits the thrust to about 5&nbsp;km/s. They produce a high thrust (about 10\u2076 N), but they have a low specific impulse, and that limits their top speed. By contrast, ion engines have low force. Still, the top speed in principle is limited only by the electrical power available on the spacecraft and the gas ions being accelerated. The exhaust speed of the charged particles range from 15&nbsp;km/s to 35&nbsp;km/s.<ref name=\"http://www.iflscience.com\">{{citation | url= http://www.iflscience.com/space/dawn-new-era-revolutionary-ion-engine-took-spacecraft-ceres | title= Dawn Of A New Era: The Revolutionary Ion Engine That Took Spacecraft To Ceres}}</ref>\n\n==== Nuclear fission powered ====\n\n===== Fission-electric =====\nNuclear-electric or plasma engines, operating for long periods at low thrust and powered by fission reactors, have the potential to reach speeds much greater than chemically powered vehicles or nuclear-thermal rockets.

This treaty would, therefore, need to be renegotiated. However, a project on the scale of an interstellar mission using currently foreseeable technology would probably require international cooperation on at least the scale of the [[International Space Station]].\n\nAnother issue to be considered, would be the [[g-force]]s imparted to a rapidly accelerated spacecraft, cargo, and passengers inside (see [[Inertia negation]]).\n\n==== Nuclear fusion rockets ====\n[[Fusion rocket]] starships, powered by [[nuclear fusion]] reactions, should conceivably be able to reach speeds of the order of 10% of that of light, based on energy considerations alone. In theory, a large number of stages could push a vehicle arbitrarily close to the speed of light.<ref name=\"L.D. Jaffe 1963, pp. 49-58\" /> These would \"burn\" such light element fuels as deuterium, tritium, <sup>3</sup>He, <sup>11</sup>B, and <sup>7</sup>Li. Because fusion yields about 0.3\u20130.9% of the mass of the nuclear fuel as released energy, it is energetically more favorable than fission, which releases <0.1% of the fuel's mass-energy. The maximum exhaust velocities potentially energetically available are correspondingly higher than for fission, typically 4\u201310% of c. However, the most easily achievable fusion reactions release a large fraction of their energy as high-energy neutrons, which are a significant source of energy loss. Thus, although these concepts seem to offer the best (nearest-term) prospects for travel to the nearest stars within a (long) human lifetime, they still involve massive technological and engineering difficulties, which may turn out to be intractable for decades or centuries.\n\n[[File:Daedalus ship.png|thumb|Daedalus interstellar vehicle.]]Early studies include [[Project Daedalus]], performed by the [[British Interplanetary Society]] in 1973\u20131978, and [[Project Longshot]], a student project sponsored by [[NASA]] and the [[US Naval Academy]], completed in 1988.

First, in the annihilation of antimatter, much of the energy is lost as high-energy [[gamma radiation]], and especially also as [[neutrino]]s, so that only about 40% of ''mc''<sup>2</sup> would be available if the antimatter were simply allowed to annihilate into radiations thermally.<ref name=\"crawist\" /> Even so, the energy available for propulsion would be substantially higher than the ~1% of ''mc''<sup>2</sup> yield of nuclear fusion, the next-best rival candidate.\n\nSecond, heat transfer from the exhaust to the vehicle seems likely to transfer enormous wasted energy into the ship (e.g., for 0.1''g'' ship acceleration, approaching 0.3 trillion watts per ton of ship mass), considering the large fraction of the energy that goes into penetrating gamma rays. Even assuming shielding was provided to protect the payload (and passengers on a crewed vehicle), some of the power would inevitably heat the vehicle. It may thereby prove a limiting factor if useful accelerations are to be achieved.\n\nMore recently, [[Friedwardt Winterberg]] proposed that a matter-antimatter GeV gamma ray laser photon rocket is possible by a relativistic proton-antiproton pinch discharge, where the recoil from the laser beam is transmitted by the [[M\u00f6ssbauer effect]] to the spacecraft.<ref name=\"AA-20120821\">{{cite journal |last=Winterberg |first=F. |title=Matter\u2013antimatter gigaelectron volt gamma ray laser rocket propulsion |date=21 August 2012 |journal=[[Acta Astronautica]] |volume=81 |issue=1 |pages=34\u201339 |bibcode = 2012AcAau..81...34W |doi = 10.1016/j.actaastro.2012.07.001 }}</ref>\n\n==== Rockets with an external energy source ====\nRockets deriving their power from external sources, such as a [[laser]], could replace their internal energy source with an energy collector, potentially reducing the mass of the ship greatly and allowing much higher travel speeds.

Bussard]] proposed the [[Bussard ramjet]], a fusion rocket in which a colossal scoop would collect the diffuse hydrogen in interstellar space, \"burn\" it on the fly using a [[proton\u2013proton chain reaction]], and expel it out of the back. Later calculations with more accurate estimates suggest that the thrust generated would be less than the drag caused by any conceivable scoop design.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Yet the idea is attractive because the fuel would be collected ''en route'' (commensurate with the concept of ''energy harvesting''), so the craft could theoretically accelerate to near the speed of light. The limitation is because the reaction can only accelerate the fuel to 0.12c. Thus the drag of catching interstellar dust and the thrust of accelerating that same dust to 0.12c would be the same when the speed is 0.12c, preventing further acceleration.\n\n==== Beamed propulsion ====\n[[File:Forward-sailcraft-scheme.png|thumb|This diagram illustrates [[Robert L. Forward]]'s scheme for slowing down an interstellar [[solar sail|light-sail]] at the star system destination.]]\n\nA [[solar sail|light sail]] or [[magnetic sail]] powered by a massive [[laser]] or particle accelerator in the home star system could potentially reach even greater speeds than a rocket- or pulse propulsion methods because it would not need to carry its own [[reaction mass]] and therefore would only need to accelerate the craft's [[Payload (air and space craft)|payload]]. [[Robert L. Forward]] proposed a means for decelerating an interstellar light sail in the destination star system without requiring a laser array to be present in that system. In this scheme, a smaller secondary sail is deployed to the rear of the spacecraft, whereas the large primary sail is detached from the craft to keep moving forward on its own. Light is reflected from the large primary sail to the secondary sail, which is used to decelerate the secondary sail and the spacecraft payload.<ref name=\"Forward1984RoundtripInterstellar\">{{cite journal | author=Forward, R.L. | title=Roundtrip Interstellar Travel Using Laser-Pushed Lightsails | journal=J Spacecraft | volume=21 | issue=2 | pages=187\u2013195 | date=1984 | doi=10.2514/3.8632 |bibcode = 1984JSpRo..21..187F }}</ref> In 2002, [[Geoffrey A.

Clocks aboard an interstellar ship would run slower than Earth clocks, so if a ship's engines were capable of continuously generating around 1&nbsp;g of acceleration (which is comfortable for humans), the ship could reach almost anywhere in the galaxy and return to Earth within 40 years ship-time (see diagram). Upon return, there would be a difference between the time elapsed on the astronaut's ship and the time elapsed on Earth.\n\nFor example, a spaceship could travel to a star 32 light-years away, initially accelerating at a constant 1.03g (i.e. 10.1&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup>) for 1.32 years (ship time), then stopping its engines and coasting for the next 17.3 years (ship time) at a constant speed, then decelerating again for 1.32 ship-years, and coming to a stop at the destination. After a short visit, the astronaut could return to Earth the same way. After the full round-trip, the clocks on board the ship show that 40 years have passed, but according to those on Earth, the ship comes back 76 years after launch.\n\nFrom the viewpoint of the astronaut, onboard clocks seem to be running normally. The star ahead seems to be approaching at a speed of 0.87 light years per ship-year. The universe would appear contracted along the direction of travel to half the size it had when the ship was at rest; the distance between that star and the Sun would seem to be 16 light years as measured by the astronaut.\n\nAt higher speeds, the time on board will run even slower, so the astronaut could travel to the center of the [[Milky Way]] (30,000 light years from Earth) and back in 40 years ship-time. But the speed according to Earth clocks will always be less than 1 light year per Earth year, so, when back home, the astronaut will find that more than 60 thousand years will have passed on Earth.\n\n==== Constant acceleration ====\n{{See also|Space travel using constant acceleration}}\n\n[[File:Roundtriptimes.png|thumb|upright=1.4|This plot shows a ship capable of 1-[[Gravitational acceleration|g]] (10&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup> or about 1.0 ly/y<sup>2</sup>) \"felt\" or proper-acceleration<ref>{{cite web | title= Clock paradox III | url= http://www.eftaylor.com/pub/spacetime/STP1stEdExercP81to100.pdf | access-date= 2014-08-31 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170721192831/http://www.eftaylor.com/pub/spacetime/STP1stEdExercP81to100.pdf | archive-date= 2017-07-21 | url-status= dead }} {{cite book | author1= Taylor, Edwin F. | author2= Wheeler, John Archibald | date= 1966 | title= Spacetime Physics | chapter-url= https://archive.org/details/spacetimephysics0000tayl | chapter-url-access= registration | publisher= W.H.

A constant acceleration journey is one where the propulsion system accelerates the ship at a constant rate for the first half of the journey, and then decelerates for the second half, so that it arrives at the destination stationary relative to where it began.  If this were performed with an acceleration similar to that experienced at the Earth's surface, it would have the added advantage of producing artificial \"gravity\" for the crew. Supplying the energy required, however, would be prohibitively expensive with current technology.<ref>Crowell, Benjamin (2011), Light and Matter Section 4.3</ref>\n\nFrom the perspective of a planetary observer, the ship will appear to accelerate steadily at first, but then more gradually as it approaches the speed of light (which it cannot exceed).

As part of this, distances between objects in the direction of the ship's motion will gradually contract until the ship begins to decelerate, at which time an onboard observer's experience of the gravitational field will be reversed.\n\nWhen the ship reaches its destination, if it were to exchange a message with its origin planet, it would find that less time had elapsed on board than had elapsed for the planetary observer, due to [[time dilation]] and [[length contraction]].\n\nThe result is an impressively fast journey for the crew.\n\n== Propulsion ==\n\n=== Rocket concepts ===\nAll rocket concepts are limited by the [[rocket equation]], which sets the characteristic velocity available as a function of exhaust velocity and mass ratio, the ratio of initial (''M''<sub>0</sub>, including fuel) to final (''M''<sub>1</sub>, fuel depleted) mass.\n\nVery high [[Power-to-weight ratio|specific power]], the ratio of thrust to total vehicle mass, is required to reach interstellar targets within sub-century time-frames.<ref>{{cite journal | title= VISTA \u2013 A Vehicle for Interplanetary Space Transport Application Powered by Inertial Confinement Fusion | author= Orth, C.

In an ion engine, electric power is used to create charged particles of the propellant, usually the gas xenon, and accelerate them to extremely high velocities. The exhaust velocity of conventional rockets is limited by the chemical energy stored in the fuel's molecular bonds, which limits the thrust to about 5&nbsp;km/s. They produce a high thrust (about 10\u2076 N), but they have a low specific impulse, and that limits their top speed. By contrast, ion engines have low force, but the top speed in principle is limited only by the electrical power available on the spacecraft and on the gas ions being accelerated. The exhaust speed of the charged particles range from 15&nbsp;km/s to 35&nbsp;km/s.<ref name=\"http://www.iflscience.com\">{{citation | url= http://www.iflscience.com/space/dawn-new-era-revolutionary-ion-engine-took-spacecraft-ceres | title= Dawn Of A New Era: The Revolutionary Ion Engine That Took Spacecraft To Ceres}}</ref>\n\n==== Nuclear fission powered ====\n\n===== Fission-electric =====\nNuclear-electric or plasma engines, operating for long periods at low thrust and powered by fission reactors, have the potential to reach speeds much greater than chemically powered vehicles or nuclear-thermal rockets. Such vehicles probably have the potential to power solar system exploration with reasonable trip times within the current century. Because of their low-thrust propulsion, they would be limited to off-planet, deep-space operation. [[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion]] powered by a portable power-source, say a [[nuclear reactor]], producing only small accelerations, would take centuries to reach for example 15% of the [[velocity of light]], thus unsuitable for interstellar flight during a single human lifetime.<ref name=\"scholar.googleusercontent.com\">{{citation|url=http://daedalus-zvezdolet.narod.ru/doceng/07eng.doc |title=Project Daedalus: The Propulsion System Part 1; Theoretical considerations and calculations. 2.

A nuclear pulse drive starship powered by fusion-antimatter catalyzed nuclear pulse propulsion units would be similarly in the 10% range and pure matter-antimatter annihilation rockets would be theoretically capable of obtaining a velocity between 50% to 80% of the speed of light. In each case saving fuel for slowing down halves the maximum speed. The concept of using a [[magnetic sail]] to decelerate the spacecraft as it approaches its destination has been discussed as an alternative to using propellant, this would allow the ship to travel near the maximum theoretical velocity.<ref>{{cite journal | title= Use of Mini-Mag Orion and superconducting coils for near-term interstellar transportation | author1= Lenard, Roger X. | author2= Andrews, Dana G. | journal= Acta Astronautica | date= June 2007 | volume= 61 | issue= 1\u20136 | url= http://www.space-nation.org/images/a/a1/Mini-Mag_Orion_and_superconducting_coils_for_near-term_interstellar_transportation_LenardAndrews.pdf | doi= 10.1016/j.actaastro.2007.01.052 | pages=450\u2013458|bibcode = 2007AcAau..61..450L }}</ref> Alternative designs utilizing similar principles include [[Project Longshot]], [[Project Daedalus]], and [[Mini-Mag Orion]].

This treaty would, therefore, need to be renegotiated, although a project on the scale of an interstellar mission using currently foreseeable technology would probably require international cooperation on at least the scale of the [[International Space Station]].\n\nAnother issue to be considered, would be the [[g-force]]s imparted to a rapidly accelerated spacecraft, cargo, and passengers inside (see [[Inertia negation]]).\n\n==== Nuclear fusion rockets ====\n[[Fusion rocket]] starships, powered by [[nuclear fusion]] reactions, should conceivably be able to reach speeds of the order of 10% of that of light, based on energy considerations alone. In theory, a large number of stages could push a vehicle arbitrarily close to the speed of light.<ref name=\"L.D. Jaffe 1963, pp. 49-58\" /> These would \"burn\" such light element fuels as deuterium, tritium, <sup>3</sup>He, <sup>11</sup>B, and <sup>7</sup>Li. Because fusion yields about 0.3\u20130.9% of the mass of the nuclear fuel as released energy, it is energetically more favorable than fission, which releases <0.1% of the fuel's mass-energy. The maximum exhaust velocities potentially energetically available are correspondingly higher than for fission, typically 4\u201310% of c. However, the most easily achievable fusion reactions release a large fraction of their energy as high-energy neutrons, which are a significant source of energy loss. Thus, although these concepts seem to offer the best (nearest-term) prospects for travel to the nearest stars within a (long) human lifetime, they still involve massive technological and engineering difficulties, which may turn out to be intractable for decades or centuries.\n\n[[File:Daedalus ship.png|thumb|Daedalus interstellar vehicle.]]Early studies include [[Project Daedalus]], performed by the [[British Interplanetary Society]] in 1973\u20131978, and [[Project Longshot]], a student project sponsored by [[NASA]] and the [[US Naval Academy]], completed in 1988.

First, in the annihilation of antimatter, much of the energy is lost as high-energy [[gamma radiation]], and especially also as [[neutrino]]s, so that only about 40% of ''mc''<sup>2</sup> would actually be available if the antimatter were simply allowed to annihilate into radiations thermally.<ref name=\"crawist\" /> Even so, the energy available for propulsion would be substantially higher than the ~1% of ''mc''<sup>2</sup> yield of nuclear fusion, the next-best rival candidate.\n\nSecond, heat transfer from the exhaust to the vehicle seems likely to transfer enormous wasted energy into the ship (e.g. for 0.1''g'' ship acceleration, approaching 0.3 trillion watts per ton of ship mass), considering the large fraction of the energy that goes into penetrating gamma rays. Even assuming shielding was provided to protect the payload (and passengers on a crewed vehicle), some of the energy would inevitably heat the vehicle, and may thereby prove a limiting factor if useful accelerations are to be achieved.\n\nMore recently, [[Friedwardt Winterberg]] proposed that a matter-antimatter GeV gamma ray laser photon rocket is possible by a relativistic proton-antiproton pinch discharge, where the recoil from the laser beam is transmitted by the [[M\u00f6ssbauer effect]] to the spacecraft.<ref name=\"AA-20120821\">{{cite journal |last=Winterberg |first=F. |title=Matter\u2013antimatter gigaelectron volt gamma ray laser rocket propulsion |date=21 August 2012 |journal=[[Acta Astronautica]] |volume=81 |issue=1 |pages=34\u201339 |bibcode = 2012AcAau..81...34W |doi = 10.1016/j.actaastro.2012.07.001 }}</ref>\n\n==== Rockets with an external energy source ====\nRockets deriving their power from external sources, such as a [[laser]], could replace their internal energy source with an energy collector, potentially reducing the mass of the ship greatly and allowing much higher travel speeds.

Bussard]] proposed the [[Bussard ramjet]], a fusion rocket in which a huge scoop would collect the diffuse hydrogen in interstellar space, \"burn\" it on the fly using a [[proton\u2013proton chain reaction]], and expel it out of the back. Later calculations with more accurate estimates suggest that the thrust generated would be less than the drag caused by any conceivable scoop design.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Yet the idea is attractive because the fuel would be collected ''en route'' (commensurate with the concept of ''energy harvesting''), so the craft could theoretically accelerate to near the speed of light. The limitation is due to the fact that the reaction can only accelerate the propellant to 0.12c. Thus the drag of catching interstellar dust and the thrust of accelerating that same dust to 0.12c would be the same when the speed is 0.12c, preventing further acceleration.\n\n==== Beamed propulsion ====\n[[File:Forward-sailcraft-scheme.png|thumb|This diagram illustrates [[Robert L. Forward]]'s scheme for slowing down an interstellar [[solar sail|light-sail]] at the star system destination.]]\n\nA [[solar sail|light sail]] or [[magnetic sail]] powered by a massive [[laser]] or particle accelerator in the home star system could potentially reach even greater speeds than rocket- or pulse propulsion methods, because it would not need to carry its own [[reaction mass]] and therefore would only need to accelerate the craft's [[Payload (air and space craft)|payload]]. [[Robert L. Forward]] proposed a means for decelerating an interstellar light sail in the destination star system without requiring a laser array to be present in that system. In this scheme, a smaller secondary sail is deployed to the rear of the spacecraft, whereas the large primary sail is detached from the craft to keep moving forward on its own. Light is reflected from the large primary sail to the secondary sail, which is used to decelerate the secondary sail and the spacecraft payload.<ref name=\"Forward1984RoundtripInterstellar\">{{cite journal | author=Forward, R.L. | title=Roundtrip Interstellar Travel Using Laser-Pushed Lightsails | journal=J Spacecraft | volume=21 | issue=2 | pages=187\u2013195 | date=1984 | doi=10.2514/3.8632 |bibcode = 1984JSpRo..21..187F }}</ref> In 2002, [[Geoffrey A.

It has been reported that at the 2008 Joint Propulsion Conference, multiple experts opined that it was improbable that humans would ever explore beyond the Solar System.<ref name=\"O\u2019Neill\">{{cite web |first=Ian |last=O\u2019Neill |date=Aug 19, 2008 |work=Universe Today |title=Interstellar travel may remain in science fiction |url=http://www.universetoday.com/2008/08/19/bad-news-insterstellar-travel-may-remain-in-science-fiction/ }}</ref> Brice N. Cassenti, an associate professor with the Department of Engineering and Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, stated that at least 100 times the total energy output of the entire world [in a given year] would be required to send a probe to the nearest star.<ref name=\"O\u2019Neill\" />\n\nAstrophysicist Sten Odenwald stated that the basic problem is that through intensive studies of thousands of detected exoplanets, most of the closest destinations within 50 light years do not yield Earth-like planets in the star's habitable zones.<ref name=\"Odenwald\">{{cite web |first=Sten |last=Odenwald |date=April 2, 2015 |work=Huffington Post Blog |title=Interstellar travel: Where should we go?|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-sten-odenwald/interstellar-travel-so-where-should-we-go_b_6971584.html }}</ref> Given the multitrillion-dollar expense of some of the proposed technologies, travelers will have to spend up to 200 years traveling at 20% the speed of light to reach the best known destinations. Moreover, once the travelers arrive at their destination (by any means), they will not be able to travel down to the surface of the target world and set up a colony unless the atmosphere is non-lethal. The prospect of making such a journey, only to spend the rest of the colony's life inside a sealed habitat and venturing outside in a spacesuit, may eliminate many prospective targets from the list.\n\nMoving at a speed close to the speed of light and encountering even a tiny stationary object like a grain of sand will have fatal consequences. For example, a gram of matter moving at 90% of the speed of light contains a kinetic energy corresponding to a small nuclear bomb (around 30kt TNT).\n\n=== Interstellar missions not for human benefit ===\n\nExplorative high-speed missions to [[Alpha Centauri]], as planned for by the [[Breakthrough Starshot|Breakthrough Starshot initiative]], are projected to be realizable within the 21st century.<ref>{{Cite journal|arxiv=1710.10732|last1=Kulkarni|first1=Neeraj|title=Relativistic Spacecraft Propelled by Directed Energy|journal=The Astronomical Journal|volume=155|issue=4|pages=155|last2=Lubin|first2=Philip|last3=Zhang|first3=Qicheng|year=2017|doi=10.3847/1538-3881/aaafd2|bibcode=2018AJ....155..155K}}</ref> It is alternatively possible to plan for unmanned slow-cruising missions taking millennia to arrive.

'''US$''' and referred to as the '''dollar''', '''U.S. dollar''', or '''American dollar''') is the official [[currency]] of the [[United States]] and its [[territories of the United States|territories]] per the [[Coinage Act of 1792]]. One dollar is divided into 100 [[cent (currency)|cent]]s (symbol: \u00a2) or 1000 [[mill (currency)|mill]]s (for accounting purposes and for taxing; symbol: \u20a5). The Coinage Act of 1792 created a decimal currency by creating the following coins: [[Dime (United States coin)|tenth dollar]], [[Half dime|one-twentieth dollar]], [[Penny (United States coin)|one-hundredth dollar]]. In addition the act created the [[Dollar coin (United States)|dollar]], [[Half dollar (United States coin)|half dollar]], and [[Quarter (United States coin)|quarter dollar]] coins. All of these coins are still minted in 2020.\n\nIn addition, several [[Series (United States currency)|forms of paper money]] were introduced by Congress over the years. The latest of these, the [[Federal Reserve Note]], was authorized by the [[Federal Reserve Act of 1913]], while all existing U.S. currency remains legal tender.<ref>{{cite web |title=FAQs |url=https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/currency_12768.htm |publisher=BOARD OF GOVERNORS of the FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM |accessdate=3 January 2020 |date=8 October 2013 |quote=All U.S. currency remains legal tender, regardless of when it was issued.}}</ref>\nIssuance of the previous form of the currency ([[United States Note|U.S. notes]]) was discontinued in January 1971.<ref>{{cite web |title=Legal Tender Status |url = https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/faqs/Currency/Pages/legal-tender.aspx |website=U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY |access-date=3 January 2020 |date=4 Jan 2011 |quote=United States notes serve no function that is not already adequately served by Federal Reserve notes.

In 1792 the [[2nd United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] passed a [[Coinage Act of 1792|Coinage Act]].

Section 20 of the act provided, \"That the money of account of the United States shall be expressed in dollars, or units... and that all accounts in the public offices and all proceedings in the courts of the United States shall be kept and had in conformity to this regulation\".

Both one-dollar coins and notes are produced today, although the note form is significantly more common.

The term ''[[Eagle (United States coin)|eagle]]'' was used in the [[Coinage Act of 1792]] for the denomination of ten dollars, and subsequently was used in naming gold coins. Paper currency less than one dollar in denomination, known as \"fractional currency\", was also sometimes pejoratively referred to as \"shinplasters\". In 1854, [[James Guthrie (American politician)|James Guthrie]], then [[Secretary of the Treasury]], proposed creating $100, $50 and $25 gold coins, which were referred to as a \"Union\", \"Half Union\", and \"Quarter Union\",<ref>Mehl, B.

The German word for valley is ''thal'', or nowadays usually ''Tal'' (cognate with \"dale\" in English). St. Joachim's Valley is now known as [[J\u00e1chymov]], in the [[Czech Republic]] (then part of the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]]).<ref name=\"NatGeo\">National Geographic. June 2002. p. 1. ''Ask US''.</ref> Joachimstaler was later shortened to the German ''[[Thaler|Taler]]'', a word that eventually found its way into many languages, including Danish and Swedish as ''daler'', Norwegian as ''dalar'' and ''daler'', Dutch as ''daler'' or ''daalder'', Ethiopian as ''talari'', Hungarian as ''tall\u00e9r'', Italian as ''tallero'', and English as ''dollar''.<ref name=\"NatGeo\"/> Alternatively, ''thaler'' is said to come from the German coin ''[[Guldengroschen]]'' (\"great guilder\", being of silver but equal in value to a gold guilder), minted from the silver from Joachimsthal.\n\nThe coins minted at Joachimsthal soon lent their name to other coins of similar size and weight from other places. One such example, was a Dutch coin depicting a lion, hence its Dutch name ''[[leeuwendaalder|leeuwendaler]]'' (in English: \"lion dollar\").\n\nThe ''leeuwendaler'' was authorized to contain 427.16 grains of .75 fine silver and passed locally for between 36 and 42 [[stuiver]]s. It was lighter than the large-denomination coins then in circulation, thus it was more advantageous for a Dutch merchant to pay a foreign debt in leeuwendalers and it became the coin of choice for foreign trade.\n\nThe ''leeuwendaler'' was popular in the [[Dutch East Indies]] and in the Dutch North American [[New Netherland|New Netherland Colony]] (today the [[New York metropolitan area]]), and circulated throughout the [[Thirteen Colonies]] during the 17th and early 18th centuries. It was also separately popular throughout Eastern Europe, where it led to the current Romanian and Moldovan currency being called [[Romanian leu|leu]] (literally \"lion\").\n\nAmong the English-speaking community, the Dutch coin came to be popularly known as lion dollar&nbsp;\u2013 and is the origin of the English ''dollar''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://coins.lakdiva.org/netherlands/1644_wes_lion_daalder_ag.html |title=Dutch Colonial&nbsp;\u2013 Lion Dollar |publisher=Coins.lakdiva.org |date= |accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref> The modern American-English pronunciation of ''dollar'' is still remarkably close to the 17th-century Dutch pronunciation of ''daler''.<ref name=\"etymologiebank.nl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.etymologiebank.nl/trefwoord/dollar |title=etymologiebank.nl |publisher=etymologiebank.nl |date= |accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\nBy analogy with this lion dollar, Spanish pesos&nbsp;\u2013 with the same weight and shape as the lion dollar&nbsp;\u2013 came to be known as ''Spanish'' dollars.<ref name=\"etymologiebank.nl\"/> By the mid-18th century, the lion dollar had been replaced by the [[Spanish dollar]], the famous \"piece of eight\", which was distributed widely in the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonies in the New World]] and in the [[Philippines]].<ref name = \"nqteor\">{{cite journal\n  | last =Julian\n  | first =R.W.\n  | title =All About the Dollar\n  | publisher =Numismatist\n  | year = 2007\n  | page =41 }}</ref>\nEventually, dollar became the name of the official American currency.\n\n===Nicknames===\n{{see also|Slang terms for money#United States}}\nThe [[colloquialism]] \"''[[Wikt:buck|buck]]''\"(s) (much like the British word \"''[[pound sterling|quid]]''\"(s, pl) for the pound sterling) is often used to refer to dollars of various nations, including the U.S. dollar.

Other well-known names of the dollar as a whole in denominations include \"''greenmail''\", \"''green''\" and \"''dead presidents''\" (the last because deceased presidents are pictured on most bills).\n\nThe term ''greenback'' is also used by foreign exchange traders with reference to the U.S. dollar as a currency,<ref name=forex/> and by the financial press in other countries, such as Australia,<ref name=BI/> New Zealand,<ref name=MW/> South Africa,<ref name=Reuters/> and India.<ref name=BT/>\n\nA \"''[[1000 (number)#In popular culture|grand]]''\", sometimes shortened to simply \"''G''\", is a common term for the amount of $1,000. The suffix \"''K''\" or \"''k''\" (from \"[[kilo-]]\") is also commonly used to denote this amount (such as \"$10k\" to mean $10,000). However, the $1,000 note is no longer in general use. A \"''large''\" or \"''stack''\", it is usually a reference to a multiple of $1,000 (such as \"''fifty large''\" meaning $50,000). The $100 note is nicknamed \"''Benjamin''\", \"''Benji''\", \"''Ben''\", or \"''Franklin''\" (after [[Benjamin Franklin]]), \"''C-note''\" (C being the [[Roman numeral]] for 100), \"''Century note''\" or \"''bill''\" (e.g. \"''two bills''\" being $200). The $50 note is occasionally called a \"''yardstick''\" or a \"''grant''\" (after President [[Ulysses S. Grant]], pictured on the obverse). The $20 note is referred to as a \"''double sawbuck''\", \"''Jackson''\" (after [[Andrew Jackson]]), or \"double eagle\". The $10 note is referred to as a \"''sawbuck''\", \"''ten-spot''\" or \"''Hamilton''\" (after [[Alexander Hamilton]]). The $5 note as \"''Lincoln''\", \"''fin''\", \"''fiver''\" or \"''five-spot''\". The infrequently-used $2 note is sometimes called \"''deuce''\", \"''Tom''\", or \"''Jefferson''\" (after [[Thomas Jefferson]]). The $1 note as a \"''single''\" or \"''buck''\". The dollar has also been referred to as a \"''bone''\" and \"''bones''\" in plural (e.g. \"''twenty bones''\" is equal to $20). The newer designs, with portraits displayed in the main body of the obverse (rather than in cameo insets), upon paper color-coded by denomination, are sometimes referred to as \"''bigface''\" notes or \"[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]] money\".\n\n\"''[[Piastre]]''\" was the original French word for the U.S. dollar, used for example in the French text of the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. Calling the dollar a piastre is still common among the speakers of [[Cajun French]] and [[New England French]]. Modern French uses ''dollar'' for this unit of currency as well. The term is still used as slang for U.S. dollars in the [[French West Indies#French Caribbean|French-speaking Caribbean]] islands, most notably [[Haiti]].\n\n==Dollar sign==\n{{Main|Dollar sign}}\n\n[[File:Potosi Real.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Spanish real|Spanish silver ''real]]'' or [[peso]] of 1768]]\n\nThe symbol '''$''', usually written before the numerical amount, is used for the U.S. dollar (as well as for many other currencies). The sign was the result of a late 18th-century evolution of the [[scribal abbreviation]] \"p<sup>s</sup>\" for the [[peso]], the common name for the [[Spanish dollars]] that were in wide circulation in the [[New World]] from the 16th to the 19th centuries.

These [[Pillars of Hercules]] on the silver Spanish dollar coins take the form of two vertical bars (||) and a swinging cloth band in the shape of an \"S\".\n\nYet another explanation suggests that the dollar sign was formed from the capital letters U and S written or printed one on top of the other.

The first dollar coins issued by the [[United States Mint]] (founded 1792) were similar in size and composition to the Spanish dollar, minted in Mexico and Peru. The Spanish, U.S. silver dollars, and later, Mexican silver pesos circulated side by side in the United States, and the Spanish dollar and Mexican peso remained legal tender until the [[Coinage Act of 1857]]. The coinage of various English colonies also circulated. The [[lion dollar]] was popular in the Dutch New Netherland Colony (New York), but the lion dollar also circulated throughout the English colonies during the 17th century and early 18th century. Examples circulating in the colonies were usually worn so that the design was not fully distinguishable, thus they were sometimes referred to as \"dog dollars\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://coins.nd.edu/ColCoin/ColCoinIntros/Lion-Dollar.intro.html |title=The Lion Dollar: Introduction |publisher=Coins.nd.edu |accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn the 6th of July 1785, the [[Continental Congress]] resolved that the money unit of the United States, the dollar, would contain 375.64 [[Grain (unit)|grains]] of fine silver; on the 8th of August 1786, the Continental Congress continued that definition and further resolved that the money of account, corresponding with the division of coins, would proceed in a [[Decimalisation|decimal ratio]], with the sub-units being mills at 0.001 of a dollar, cents at 0.010 of a dollar, and dimes at 0.100 of a dollar.<ref name=\"contcongress1\"/>\n\nAfter the adoption of the [[United States Constitution]], the U.S. dollar was defined by the Coinage Act of 1792, which specified a \"dollar\" to be based in the Spanish milled dollar and of 371 [[grain (unit)|grain]]s and 4 sixteenths part of a grain of pure or {{convert|416|gr}} of standard silver and an \"eagle\" to be 247 and 4 eighths of a grain or {{convert|270|gr}} of gold (again depending on purity).<ref>{{cite web|last=Mint|first=U.S.|title=Coinage Act of 1792|url=https://www.usmint.gov/learn/history/historical-documents/coinage-act-of-april-2-1792|publisher=U.S. treasury}}</ref> The choice of the value 371 grains arose from [[Alexander Hamilton]]'s decision to base the new American unit on the average weight of a selection of worn Spanish dollars. Hamilton got the treasury to weigh a sample of Spanish dollars and the average weight came out to be 371 grains. A new Spanish dollar was usually about 377 grains in weight, and so the new U.S. dollar was at a slight discount in relation to the Spanish dollar.\n\nThe same coinage act also set the value of an eagle at 10 dollars, and the dollar at {{frac|10}} eagle. It called for 90% silver alloy coins in denominations of 1, {{frac|2}}, {{frac|4}}, {{frac|10}}, and {{frac|20}} dollars; it called for 90% gold alloy coins in denominations of 1, {{frac|2}}, {{frac|4}}, and {{frac|10}} eagles. The value of gold or silver contained in the dollar was then converted into relative value in the economy for the buying and selling of goods. This allowed the value of things to remain fairly constant over time, except for the influx and outflux of gold and silver in the nation's economy.<ref>See [https://www.ecominoes.com/2013/01/the-definitive-inflation-chart.html].</ref>\n\nThe early currency of the United States did not exhibit faces of presidents, as is the custom now;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oanda.com/currency/iso-currency-codes/USD|title=United States Dollar|publisher=OANDA|accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref> although today, by law, only the portrait of a deceased individual may appear on United States currency.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/5114|title=Engraving and printing currency and security documents:Article b|publisher=Legal Information Institute|accessdate=December 19, 2013}}</ref> In fact, the newly formed government was against having portraits of leaders on the currency, a practice compared to the policies of European monarchs.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/28312/money-everything-you-ever-wanted-know-about-coin-portraits|title=On the Money: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Coin Portraits|author=Matt Soniak|magazine=Mental Floss|date=July 22, 2011|accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref> The currency as we know it today did not get the faces they currently have until after the early 20th century; before that \"heads\" side of coinage used profile faces and striding, seated, and standing figures from Greek and Roman mythology and composite Native Americans.

Freed from British monetary regulations, they each issued [[\u00a3sd]] paper money to pay for military expenses. The [[Continental Congress]] also began issuing \"Continental Currency\" denominated in Spanish dollars. The dollar was valued relative to the states' currencies at the following rates:\n* 5 shillings \u2013 [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]\n* 6 shillings \u2013 [[Connecticut]], [[Massachusetts]], [[New Hampshire]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Virginia]]\n* {{frac|7|1|2}} shillings \u2013 [[Delaware]], [[Maryland]], [[New Jersey]], [[Pennsylvania]]\n* 8 shillings \u2013 New York, [[North Carolina]]\n* {{frac|32|1|2}} shillings \u2013 [[South Carolina]]\n\nContinental currency [[depreciation (currency)|depreciated]] badly during the war, giving rise to the famous phrase \"not worth a continental\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Newman|first1=Eric P.|title=The Early Paper Money of America|date=1990|publisher=Krause Publications|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=0-87341-120-X|page=17|edition=3}}</ref> A primary problem was that monetary policy was not coordinated between Congress and the states, which continued to issue bills of credit.

The gold coins that were minted were not given any denomination and traded for a market value relative to the Congressional standard of the silver dollar. 1834 saw a shift in the [[gold standard]] to {{convert|23.2|gr}}, followed by a slight adjustment to {{convert|23.22|gr}} in 1837 (16:1 ratio).{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}\n\nIn 1862, paper money was issued without the backing of precious metals, due to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Silver and gold coins continued to be issued and in 1878 the link between paper money and coins was reinstated. This disconnection from gold and silver backing also occurred during the [[War of 1812]]. The use of paper money not backed by precious metals had also occurred under the Articles of Confederation from 1777 to 1788. With no solid backing and being easily counterfeited, the continentals quickly lost their value, giving rise to the phrase \"not worth a continental\". This was a primary reason for the \"No state shall... make any thing but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts\" clause in [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 10: Limits on the States|article 1, section 10]] of the United States Constitution.\n\nIn order to finance the [[War of 1812]], Congress authorized the issuance of [[Treasury Note (19th century)|Treasury Note]]s, interest-bearing short-term debt that could be used to pay public dues. While they were intended to serve as debt, they did function \"to a limited extent\" as money. Treasury Notes were again printed to help resolve the reduction in public revenues resulting from the [[Panic of 1837]] and the [[Panic of 1857]], as well as to help finance the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] and the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].\n\nIn addition to Treasury Notes, in 1861, Congress authorized the Treasury to borrow $50 million in the form of [[Demand Notes]], which did not bear interest but could be redeemed on demand for precious metals. However, by December 1861, the Union government's supply of specie was outstripped by demand for redemption and they were forced to suspend redemption temporarily. The following February, Congress passed the [[Legal Tender Cases|Legal Tender Act of 1862]], issuing [[United States Notes]], which were not redeemable on demand and bore no interest, but were [[legal tender]], meaning that creditors had to accept them at face value for any payment except for public debts and import tariffs. However, silver and gold coins continued to be issued, resulting in the depreciation of the newly printed notes through [[Gresham's Law]]. In 1869, Supreme Court ruled in [[Hepburn v. Griswold]] that Congress could not require creditors to accept United States Notes, but overturned that ruling the next year in the [[Legal Tender Cases]]. In 1875, Congress passed the [[Specie Payment Resumption Act]], requiring the Treasury to allow US Notes to be redeemed for gold after January 1, 1879. The Treasury ceased to issue United States Notes in 1971.\n\nThe [[Gold Standard Act]] of 1900 abandoned the bimetallic standard and defined the dollar as {{convert|23.22|gr}} of gold, equivalent to setting the price of 1 [[troy ounce]] of gold at $20.67. Silver coins continued to be issued for circulation until 1964, when all silver was removed from dimes and quarters, and the half dollar was reduced to 40% silver. Silver half dollars were last issued for circulation in 1970. Gold coins were confiscated by [[Executive Order 6102]] issued in 1933 by Franklin Roosevelt. The gold standard was changed to {{convert|13.71|gr}}, equivalent to setting the price of 1 troy ounce of gold at $35. This standard persisted until 1968.\n\nBetween 1968 and 1975, a variety of pegs to gold were put in place, eventually culminating in a sudden end, on August 15, 1971, to the convertibility of dollars to gold later dubbed the [[Nixon Shock]]. The last peg was $42.22 per ounce{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} before the U.S. dollar was allowed to freely float on [[Foreign exchange market|currency markets]].\n\nAccording to the [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]], the largest note it ever printed was the $100,000 Gold Certificate, Series 1934. These notes were printed from December 18, 1934, through January 9, 1935, and were issued by the Treasurer of the United States to Federal Reserve Banks only against an equal amount of gold bullion held by the Treasury. These notes were used for transactions between Federal Reserve Banks and were not circulated among the general public.\n\n==Coins==\n{{Main|Coins of the United States dollar}}\n\nOfficial United States coins have been produced every year from 1792 to the present.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"background:#2E8B57;\"\n!

Published April 25, 2005.</ref> [[United States dollar coin|Silver dollars]] were minted intermittently from 1794 through 1935; a copper-nickel dollar of the same large size, featuring President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], was minted from 1971 through 1978. Gold dollars were also minted in the 19th century. The [[Susan B. Anthony]] [[Susan B. Anthony dollar|dollar]] coin was introduced in 1979; these proved to be unpopular because they were often mistaken for quarters, due to their nearly equal size, their milled edge, and their similar color. Minting of these dollars for circulation was suspended in 1980 (collectors' pieces were struck in 1981), but, as with all past U.S. coins, they remain [[legal tender]]. As the number of Anthony dollars held by the Federal Reserve and dispensed primarily to make change in postal and transit vending machines had been virtually exhausted, additional Anthony dollars were struck in 1999. In 2000, a [[Sacagawea dollar|new dollar coin]] featuring [[Sacagawea]] was introduced, which corrected some of the problems of the Anthony dollar by having a smooth edge and a gold color, without requiring changes to vending machines that accept the Anthony dollar. However, this new coin has failed to achieve the popularity of the still-existing dollar bill and is rarely used in daily transactions. The failure to simultaneously withdraw the dollar bill and weak publicity efforts have been cited by coin proponents as primary reasons for the failure of the dollar coin to gain popular support.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gao.gov/new.items/d02896.pdf |title=Report to the Subcommittee on Treasury and General Government, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate |publisher=USGAO |date= |accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2007, the [[U.S. Mint]], under the [[Presidential $1 Coin Act of 2005]],<ref>Pub. L. No. 109-145, 119 Stat. 2664 (December 22, 2005).</ref> introduced a new $1 U.S. Presidential dollar coin. Based on the success of the \"[[50 State Quarters]]\" series, the new coin features a sequence of presidents in order of their inaugurations, starting with [[George Washington]], on the obverse side. The reverse side features the [[Statue of Liberty]]. To allow for larger, more detailed portraits, the traditional inscriptions of \"[[E Pluribus Unum]]\", \"[[In God We Trust]]\", the year of minting or issuance, and the mint mark will be inscribed on the edge of the coin instead of the face. This feature, similar to the edge inscriptions seen on the [[One pound (British decimal coin)|British \u00a31]] coin, is not usually associated with U.S. coin designs. The inscription \"Liberty\" has been eliminated, with the Statue of Liberty serving as a sufficient replacement. In addition, due to the nature of U.S. coins, this will be the first time there will be circulating U.S. coins of different denominations with the same president featured on the obverse (heads) side ([[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]]/[[Penny (United States coin)|penny]], [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]]/[[Nickel (United States coin)|nickel]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]/[[Dime (United States coin)|dime]], [[George Washington|Washington]]/[[Quarter (United States coin)|quarter]], [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]]/[[Half dollar (United States coin)|half dollar]], and [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]]/[[Dollar coin (United States)|dollar]]). Another unusual fact about the new $1 coin is [[Grover Cleveland]] will have two coins with two different portraits issued due to the fact he was the only U.S. President to be elected to two non-consecutive terms.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usmint.gov/news/press-releases/20120619-united-states-mint-releases-2012-presidential-1-fourcoin-set-on-june-26 |title=United States Mint Releases 2012 Presidential $1 Four\u2013Coin Set on June 26 |publisher=Usmint.com |date=June 19, 2012 |accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\nEarly releases of the Washington coin included [[error coins]] shipped primarily from the Philadelphia mint to Florida and Tennessee banks. Highly sought after by collectors, and trading for as much as $850 each within a week of discovery, the error coins were identified by the absence of the edge impressions \"E PLURIBUS UNUM IN GOD WE TRUST 2007 P\". The mint of origin is generally accepted to be mostly Philadelphia, although identifying the source mint is impossible without opening a mint pack also containing marked units. Edge lettering is minted in both orientations with respect to \"heads\", some amateur collectors were initially duped into buying \"upside down lettering error\" coins.<ref>[http://ap.washingtontimes.com/dynamic/stories/G/GODLESS_DOLLARS Godless Dollars]{{dead link|date=March 2018}}</ref> Some cynics also erroneously point out that the Federal Reserve makes more profit from dollar bills than dollar coins because they wear out in a few years, whereas coins are more permanent. The fallacy of this argument arises because new notes printed to replace worn out notes, which have been withdrawn from circulation, bring in no net revenue to the government to offset the costs of printing new notes and destroying the old ones. As most [[vending machines]] are incapable of making change in [[banknotes]], they commonly accept only $1 bills, though a few will give change in dollar coins.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n===Mint marks===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Mint\n!Mint mark\n!Metal minted\n!Year established\n!Current status\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"| [[Denver Mint|Denver]]\n|bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"| D\n|bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"| All metals\n|bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"| 1906\n|bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"| Facility open\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"| [[Philadelphia Mint|Philadelphia]]\n|bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"| P ''or'' ''none''{{refn| group = lower-alpha | The letter \"P\" is used for the Philadelphia mint mark on all coins (except cents) released from 1980 onward.

Notes above the $100 denomination stopped being printed in 1946 and were officially withdrawn from circulation in 1969. These notes were used primarily in inter-bank transactions or by [[organized crime]]; it was the latter usage that prompted President [[Richard Nixon]] to issue an executive order in 1969 halting their use. With the advent of electronic banking, they became less necessary. Notes in denominations of $500, $1,000, $5,000, $10,000, and $100,000 were all produced at one time; see [[large denomination bills in U.S. currency]] for details. With the exception of the $100,000 bill (which was only issued as a Series 1934 Gold Certificate and was never publicly circulated; thus it is illegal to own), these notes are now collectors' items and are worth more than their face value to collectors.\n\nThough still predominantly green, post-2004 series incorporate other colors to better distinguish different denominations. As a result of a 2008 decision in an accessibility lawsuit filed by the [[American Council of the Blind]], the [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]] is planning to implement a raised tactile feature in the next redesign of each note, except the $1 and the current version of the $100 bill.

Commercial banks can freely withdraw in cash any excess reserves from their reserve account at the Federal Reserve.

In other instances, monetary policy might instead entail the targeting of a specific exchange rate relative to some foreign currency or else relative to gold. For example, in the case of the United States the Federal Reserve targets the [[federal funds rate]], the rate at which member banks lend to one another overnight. The other primary means of conducting monetary policy include: (i) [[Discount window]] lending (as [[lender of last resort]]); (ii) Fractional deposit lending (changes in the reserve requirement); (iii) Moral suasion (cajoling certain market players to achieve specified outcomes); (iv) \"[[Open mouth operations]]\" (talking monetary policy with the market).\n\n==Value==\n{| cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"{{float right}}\"\n|+ Buying power of one U.S. dollar compared to 1775 [[Continental Currency|Continental currency]]\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0;\"\n|-\n!&nbsp;Year&nbsp;\n!style=\"width: 40pt; font-size: 95%;\"|&nbsp;Equivalent&nbsp; buying power\n|-\n|1775||&nbsp;$1.00\n|-\n|1780||&nbsp;$0.59\n|-\n|1790||&nbsp;$0.89\n|-\n|1800||&nbsp;$0.64\n|-\n|1810||&nbsp;$0.66\n|-\n|1820||&nbsp;$0.69\n|-\n|1830||&nbsp;$0.88\n|-\n|1840||&nbsp;$0.94\n|-\n|1850||&nbsp;$1.03\n|-\n|1860||&nbsp;$0.97\n|}\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0;\"\n|-\n!&nbsp;Year&nbsp;\n!style=\"width: 40pt; font-size: 95%;\"|&nbsp;Equivalent&nbsp; buying power\n|-\n|1870||&nbsp;$0.62\n|-\n|1880||&nbsp;$0.79\n|-\n|1890||&nbsp;$0.89\n|-\n|1900||&nbsp;$0.96\n|-\n|1910||&nbsp;$0.85\n|-\n|1920||&nbsp;$0.39\n|-\n|1930||&nbsp;$0.47\n|-\n|1940||&nbsp;$0.56\n|-\n|1950||&nbsp;$0.33\n|-\n|1960||&nbsp;$0.26\n|}\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0;\"\n|-\n!&nbsp;Year&nbsp;\n!style=\"width: 40pt; font-size: 95%;\"|&nbsp;Equivalent&nbsp; buying power\n|-\n|1970||&nbsp;$0.20\n|-\n|1980||&nbsp;$0.10\n|-\n|1990||&nbsp;$0.06\n|-\n|2000||&nbsp;$0.05\n|-\n|2007||&nbsp;$0.04\n|-\n|2008||&nbsp;$0.04\n|-\n|2009||&nbsp;$0.04\n|-\n|2010||&nbsp;$0.035\n|-\n|2011||&nbsp;$0.034\n|-\n|2012||&nbsp;$0.03\n|}\n|}\n\n[[File:US Consumer Price Index Graph.svg|thumb|upright=2.1|U.S. Consumer Price Index, starting from 1913]]\n\nThe 6th paragraph of [[Coinage clause|Section 8]] of Article 1 of the U.S. Constitution provides that the U.S. Congress shall have the power to \"coin money\" and to \"regulate the value\" of domestic and foreign coins.

'''US$''' and referred to as the '''dollar''', '''U.S. dollar''', or '''American dollar''') is the official [[currency]] of the [[United States]] and its [[territories of the United States|territories]] per the [[Coinage Act of 1792]]. One dollar is divided into 100 [[cent (currency)|cent]]s (symbol: \u00a2) or 1000 [[mill (currency)|mill]]s (for accounting purposes and for taxing; symbol: \u20a5). The Coinage Act of 1792 created a decimal currency by creating the following coins: [[Dime (United States coin)|tenth dollar]], [[Half dime|one-twentieth dollar]], [[Penny (United States coin)|one-hundredth dollar]]. In addition the act created the [[Dollar coin (United States)|dollar]], [[Half dollar (United States coin)|half dollar]], and [[Quarter (United States coin)|quarter dollar]] coins. All of these coins are still minted in 2020.\n\nIn addition, several [[Series (United States currency)|forms of paper money]] were introduced by Congress over the years.

The German word for valley is ''thal'', or nowadays usually ''Tal'' (cognate with \"dale\" in English). St. Joachim's Valley is now known as [[J\u00e1chymov]], in the [[Czech Republic]] (then part of the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]]).<ref name=\"NatGeo\">National Geographic. June 2002. p. 1. ''Ask US''.</ref> Joachimstaler was later shortened to the German ''[[Thaler|Taler]]'', a word that eventually found its way into many languages, including Danish and Swedish as ''daler'', Norwegian as ''dalar'' and ''daler'', Dutch as ''daler'' or ''daalder'', Ethiopian as ''talari'', Hungarian as ''tall\u00e9r'', Italian as ''tallero'', and English as ''dollar''.<ref name=\"NatGeo\"/> Alternatively, ''thaler'' is said to come from the German coin ''[[Guldengroschen]]'' (\"great guilder\", being of silver but equal in value to a gold guilder), minted from the silver from Joachimsthal.\n\nThe coins minted at Joachimsthal soon lent their name to other coins of similar size and weight from other places. One such example, was a Dutch coin depicting a lion, hence its Dutch name ''[[leeuwendaalder|leeuwendaler]]'' (in English: \"lion dollar\").\n\nThe ''leeuwendaler'' was authorized to contain 427.16 grains of .75 fine silver and passed locally for between 36 and 42 [[stuiver]]s. It was lighter than the large-denomination coins then in circulation, thus it was more advantageous for a Dutch merchant to pay a foreign debt in leeuwendalers and it became the coin of choice for foreign trade.\n\nThe ''leeuwendaler'' was popular in the [[Dutch East Indies]] and in the Dutch North American [[New Netherland|New Netherland Colony]] (today the [[New York metropolitan area]]), and circulated throughout the [[Thirteen Colonies]] during the 17th and early 18th centuries. It was also separately popular throughout Eastern Europe, where it led to the current Romanian and Moldovan currency being called [[Romanian leu|leu]] (literally \"lion\").\n\nAmong the English-speaking community, the Dutch coin came to be popularly known as lion dollar&nbsp;\u2013 and is the origin of the English ''dollar''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://coins.lakdiva.org/netherlands/1644_wes_lion_daalder_ag.html |title=Dutch Colonial&nbsp;\u2013 Lion Dollar |publisher=Coins.lakdiva.org |date= |accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref> The modern American-English pronunciation of ''dollar'' is still remarkably close to the 17th-century Dutch pronunciation of ''daler''.<ref name=\"etymologiebank.nl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.etymologiebank.nl/trefwoord/dollar |title=etymologiebank.nl |publisher=etymologiebank.nl |date= |accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\nBy analogy with this lion dollar, Spanish pesos&nbsp;\u2013 with the same weight and shape as the lion dollar&nbsp;\u2013 came to be known as ''Spanish'' dollars.<ref name=\"etymologiebank.nl\"/> By the mid-18th century, the lion dollar had been replaced by the [[Spanish dollar]], the famous \"piece of eight\", which was distributed widely in the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonies in the New World]] and in the [[Philippines]].<ref name = \"nqteor\">{{cite journal\n  | last =Julian\n  | first =R.W.\n  | title =All About the Dollar\n  | publisher =Numismatist\n  | year = 2007\n  | page =41 }}</ref>\nEventually, dollar became the name of the official American currency.\n\n===Nicknames===\n{{see also|Slang terms for money#United States}}\nThe [[colloquialism]] \"''[[Wikt:buck|buck]]''\"(s) (much like the British word \"''[[pound sterling|quid]]''\"(s, pl) for the pound sterling) is often used to refer to dollars of various nations, including the U.S. dollar.

The suffix \"''K''\" or \"''k''\" (from \"[[kilo-]]\") is also commonly used to denote this amount (such as \"$10k\" to mean $10,000). However, the $1,000 note is no longer in general use. A \"''large''\" or \"''stack''\", it is usually a reference to a multiple of $1,000 (such as \"''fifty large''\" meaning $50,000). The $100 note is nicknamed \"''Benjamin''\", \"''Benji''\", \"''Ben''\", or \"''Franklin''\" (after [[Benjamin Franklin]]), \"''C-note''\" (C being the [[Roman numeral]] for 100), \"''Century note''\" or \"''bill''\" (e.g. \"''two bills''\" being $200). The $50 note is occasionally called a \"''yardstick''\" or a \"''grant''\" (after President [[Ulysses S. Grant]], pictured on the obverse). The $20 note is referred to as a \"''double sawbuck''\", \"''Jackson''\" (after [[Andrew Jackson]]), or \"double eagle\". The $10 note is referred to as a \"''sawbuck''\", \"''ten-spot''\" or \"''Hamilton''\" (after [[Alexander Hamilton]]). The $5 note as \"''Lincoln''\", \"''fin''\", \"''fiver''\" or \"''five-spot''\". The infrequently-used $2 note is sometimes called \"''deuce''\", \"''Tom''\", or \"''Jefferson''\" (after [[Thomas Jefferson]]). The $1 note as a \"''single''\" or \"''buck''\". The dollar has also been referred to as a \"''bone''\" and \"''bones''\" in plural (e.g. \"''twenty bones''\" is equal to $20). The newer designs, with portraits displayed in the main body of the obverse (rather than in cameo insets), upon paper color-coded by denomination, are sometimes referred to as \"''bigface''\" notes or \"[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]] money\".\n\n\"''[[Piastre]]''\" was the original French word for the U.S. dollar, used for example in the French text of the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. Calling the dollar a piastre is still common among the speakers of [[Cajun French]] and [[New England French]]. Modern French uses ''dollar'' for this unit of currency as well. The term is still used as slang for U.S. dollars in the [[French West Indies#French Caribbean|French-speaking Caribbean]] islands, most notably [[Haiti]].\n\n==Dollar sign==\n{{Main|Dollar sign}}\n\n[[File:Potosi Real.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Spanish real|Spanish silver ''real]]'' or [[peso]] of 1768]]\n\nThe symbol '''$''', usually written before the numerical amount, is used for the U.S. dollar (as well as for many other currencies).

The first dollar coins issued by the [[United States Mint]] (founded 1792) were similar in size and composition to the Spanish dollar, minted in Mexico and Peru. The Spanish, U.S. silver dollars, and later, Mexican silver pesos circulated side by side in the United States, and the Spanish dollar and Mexican peso remained legal tender until the [[Coinage Act of 1857]]. The coinage of various English colonies also circulated. The [[lion dollar]] was popular in the Dutch New Netherland Colony (New York), but the lion dollar also circulated throughout the English colonies during the 17th century and early 18th century. Examples circulating in the colonies were usually worn so that the design was not fully distinguishable, thus they were sometimes referred to as \"dog dollars\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://coins.nd.edu/ColCoin/ColCoinIntros/Lion-Dollar.intro.html |title=The Lion Dollar: Introduction |publisher=Coins.nd.edu |accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn the 6th of July 1785, the [[Continental Congress]] resolved that the money unit of the United States, the dollar, would contain 375.64 [[Grain (unit)|grains]] of fine silver; on the 8th of August 1786, the Continental Congress continued that definition and further resolved that the money of account, corresponding with the division of coins, would proceed in a [[Decimalisation|decimal ratio]], with the sub-units being mills at 0.001 of a dollar, cents at 0.010 of a dollar, and dimes at 0.100 of a dollar.<ref name=\"contcongress1\"/>\n\nAfter the adoption of the [[United States Constitution]], the U.S. dollar was defined by the Coinage Act of 1792, which specified a \"dollar\" to be based in the Spanish milled dollar and of 371 [[grain (unit)|grain]]s and 4 sixteenths part of a grain of pure or {{convert|416|gr}} of standard silver and an \"eagle\" to be 247 and 4 eighths of a grain or {{convert|270|gr}} of gold (again depending on purity).<ref>{{cite web|last=Mint|first=U.S.|title=Coinage Act of 1792|url=https://www.usmint.gov/learn/history/historical-documents/coinage-act-of-april-2-1792|publisher=U.S. treasury}}</ref> The choice of the value 371 grains arose from [[Alexander Hamilton]]'s decision to base the new American unit on the average weight of a selection of worn Spanish dollars. Hamilton got the treasury to weigh a sample of Spanish dollars and the average weight came out to be 371 grains. A new Spanish dollar was usually about 377 grains in weight, and so the new U.S. dollar was at a slight discount in relation to the Spanish dollar.\n\nThe same coinage act also set the value of an eagle at 10 dollars, and the dollar at {{frac|10}} eagle. It called for 90% silver alloy coins in denominations of 1, {{frac|2}}, {{frac|4}}, {{frac|10}}, and {{frac|20}} dollars; it called for 90% gold alloy coins in denominations of 1, {{frac|2}}, {{frac|4}}, and {{frac|10}} eagles. The value of gold or silver contained in the dollar was then converted into relative value in the economy for the buying and selling of goods. This allowed the value of things to remain fairly constant over time, except for the influx and outflux of gold and silver in the nation's economy.<ref>See [https://www.ecominoes.com/2013/01/the-definitive-inflation-chart.html].</ref>\n\nThe early currency of the United States did not exhibit faces of presidents, as is the custom now;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oanda.com/currency/iso-currency-codes/USD|title=United States Dollar|publisher=OANDA|accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref> although today, by law, only the portrait of a deceased individual may appear on United States currency.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/5114|title=Engraving and printing currency and security documents:Article b|publisher=Legal Information Institute|accessdate=December 19, 2013}}</ref> In fact, the newly formed government was against having portraits of leaders on the currency, a practice compared to the policies of European monarchs.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/28312/money-everything-you-ever-wanted-know-about-coin-portraits|title=On the Money: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Coin Portraits|author=Matt Soniak|magazine=Mental Floss|date=July 22, 2011|accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref> The currency as we know it today did not get the faces they currently have until after the early 20th century; before that \"heads\" side of coinage used profile faces and striding, seated, and standing figures from Greek and Roman mythology and composite Native Americans.

Freed from British monetary regulations, they each issued [[\u00a3sd]] paper money to pay for military expenses. The [[Continental Congress]] also began issuing \"Continental Currency\" denominated in Spanish dollars. The dollar was valued relative to the states' currencies at the following rates:\n* 5 shillings \u2013 [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]\n* 6 shillings \u2013 [[Connecticut]], [[Massachusetts]], [[New Hampshire]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Virginia]]\n* {{frac|7|1|2}} shillings \u2013 [[Delaware]], [[Maryland]], [[New Jersey]], [[Pennsylvania]]\n* 8 shillings \u2013 New York, [[North Carolina]]\n* {{frac|32|1|2}} shillings \u2013 [[South Carolina]]\n\nContinental currency [[depreciation (currency)|depreciated]] badly during the war, giving rise to the famous phrase \"not worth a continental\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Newman|first1=Eric P.|title=The Early Paper Money of America|date=1990|publisher=Krause Publications|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=0-87341-120-X|page=17|edition=3}}</ref> A primary problem was that monetary policy was not coordinated between Congress and the states, which continued to issue bills of credit.

The gold coins that were minted were not given any denomination and traded for a market value relative to the Congressional standard of the silver dollar. 1834 saw a shift in the [[gold standard]] to {{convert|23.2|gr}}, followed by a slight adjustment to {{convert|23.22|gr}} in 1837 (16:1 ratio).{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}\n\nIn 1862, paper money was issued without the backing of precious metals, due to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Silver and gold coins continued to be issued and in 1878 the link between paper money and coins was reinstated. This disconnection from gold and silver backing also occurred during the [[War of 1812]]. The use of paper money not backed by precious metals had also occurred under the Articles of Confederation from 1777 to 1788. With no solid backing and being easily counterfeited, the continentals quickly lost their value, giving rise to the phrase \"not worth a continental\". This was a primary reason for the \"No state shall... make any thing but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts\" clause in [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 10: Limits on the States|article 1, section 10]] of the United States Constitution.\n\nIn order to finance the [[War of 1812]], Congress authorized the issuance of [[Treasury Note (19th century)|Treasury Note]]s, interest-bearing short-term debt that could be used to pay public dues. While they were intended to serve as debt, they did function \"to a limited extent\" as money. Treasury Notes were again printed to help resolve the reduction in public revenues resulting from the [[Panic of 1837]] and the [[Panic of 1857]], as well as to help finance the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] and the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].\n\nIn addition to Treasury Notes, in 1861, Congress authorized the Treasury to borrow $50 million in the form of [[Demand Notes]], which did not bear interest but could be redeemed on demand for precious metals. However, by December 1861, the Union government's supply of specie was outstripped by demand for redemption and they were forced to suspend redemption temporarily. The following February, Congress passed the [[Legal Tender Cases|Legal Tender Act of 1862]], issuing [[United States Notes]], which were not redeemable on demand and bore no interest, but were [[legal tender]], meaning that creditors had to accept them at face value for any payment except for public debts and import tariffs. However, silver and gold coins continued to be issued, resulting in the depreciation of the newly printed notes through [[Gresham's Law]]. In 1869, Supreme Court ruled in [[Hepburn v. Griswold]] that Congress could not require creditors to accept United States Notes, but overturned that ruling the next year in the [[Legal Tender Cases]]. In 1875, Congress passed the [[Specie Payment Resumption Act]], requiring the Treasury to allow US Notes to be redeemed for gold after January 1, 1879. The Treasury ceased to issue United States Notes in 1971.\n\nThe [[Gold Standard Act]] of 1900 abandoned the bimetallic standard and defined the dollar as {{convert|23.22|gr}} of gold, equivalent to setting the price of 1 [[troy ounce]] of gold at $20.67. Silver coins continued to be issued for circulation until 1964, when all silver was removed from dimes and quarters, and the half dollar was reduced to 40% silver. Silver half dollars were last issued for circulation in 1970. Gold coins were confiscated by [[Executive Order 6102]] issued in 1933 by Franklin Roosevelt. The gold standard was changed to {{convert|13.71|gr}}, equivalent to setting the price of 1 troy ounce of gold at $35. This standard persisted until 1968.\n\nBetween 1968 and 1975, a variety of pegs to gold were put in place, eventually culminating in a sudden end, on August 15, 1971, to the convertibility of dollars to gold later dubbed the [[Nixon Shock]]. The last peg was $42.22 per ounce{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} before the U.S. dollar was allowed to freely float on [[Foreign exchange market|currency markets]].\n\nAccording to the [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]], the largest note it ever printed was the $100,000 Gold Certificate, Series 1934. These notes were printed from December 18, 1934, through January 9, 1935, and were issued by the Treasurer of the United States to Federal Reserve Banks only against an equal amount of gold bullion held by the Treasury. These notes were used for transactions between Federal Reserve Banks and were not circulated among the general public.\n\n==Coins==\n{{Main|Coins of the United States dollar}}\n\nOfficial United States coins have been produced every year from 1792 to the present.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"background:#2E8B57;\"\n!

Another type of proof set is the Presidential Dollar Proof Set where the four special $1 coins are minted each year featuring a president. Because of budget constraints and increasing stockpiles of these relatively unpopular coins, the production of new Presidential dollar coins for circulation was suspended on December 13, 2011, by U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F.

Written by Gordon T. Anderson. Published April 25, 2005.</ref> [[United States dollar coin|Silver dollars]] were minted intermittently from 1794 through 1935; a copper-nickel dollar of the same large size, featuring President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], was minted from 1971 through 1978. Gold dollars were also minted in the 19th century. The [[Susan B. Anthony]] [[Susan B. Anthony dollar|dollar]] coin was introduced in 1979; these proved to be unpopular because they were often mistaken for quarters, due to their nearly equal size, their milled edge, and their similar color. Minting of these dollars for circulation was suspended in 1980 (collectors' pieces were struck in 1981), but, as with all past U.S. coins, they remain [[legal tender]]. As the number of Anthony dollars held by the Federal Reserve and dispensed primarily to make change in postal and transit vending machines had been virtually exhausted, additional Anthony dollars were struck in 1999. In 2000, a [[Sacagawea dollar|new dollar coin]] featuring [[Sacagawea]] was introduced, which corrected some of the problems of the Anthony dollar by having a smooth edge and a gold color, without requiring changes to vending machines that accept the Anthony dollar. However, this new coin has failed to achieve the popularity of the still-existing dollar bill and is rarely used in daily transactions. The failure to simultaneously withdraw the dollar bill and weak publicity efforts have been cited by coin proponents as primary reasons for the failure of the dollar coin to gain popular support.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gao.gov/new.items/d02896.pdf |title=Report to the Subcommittee on Treasury and General Government, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate |publisher=USGAO |date= |accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2007, the [[U.S. Mint]], under the [[Presidential $1 Coin Act of 2005]],<ref>Pub. L. No. 109-145, 119 Stat. 2664 (December 22, 2005).</ref> introduced a new $1 U.S. Presidential dollar coin. Based on the success of the \"[[50 State Quarters]]\" series, the new coin features a sequence of presidents in order of their inaugurations, starting with [[George Washington]], on the obverse side. The reverse side features the [[Statue of Liberty]]. To allow for larger, more detailed portraits, the traditional inscriptions of \"[[E Pluribus Unum]]\", \"[[In God We Trust]]\", the year of minting or issuance, and the mint mark will be inscribed on the edge of the coin instead of the face. This feature, similar to the edge inscriptions seen on the [[One pound (British decimal coin)|British \u00a31]] coin, is not usually associated with U.S. coin designs. The inscription \"Liberty\" has been eliminated, with the Statue of Liberty serving as a sufficient replacement. In addition, due to the nature of U.S. coins, this will be the first time there will be circulating U.S. coins of different denominations with the same president featured on the obverse (heads) side ([[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]]/[[Penny (United States coin)|penny]], [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]]/[[Nickel (United States coin)|nickel]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]/[[Dime (United States coin)|dime]], [[George Washington|Washington]]/[[Quarter (United States coin)|quarter]], [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]]/[[Half dollar (United States coin)|half dollar]], and [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]]/[[Dollar coin (United States)|dollar]]). Another unusual fact about the new $1 coin is [[Grover Cleveland]] will have two coins with two different portraits issued due to the fact he was the only U.S. President to be elected to two non-consecutive terms.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usmint.gov/news/press-releases/20120619-united-states-mint-releases-2012-presidential-1-fourcoin-set-on-june-26 |title=United States Mint Releases 2012 Presidential $1 Four\u2013Coin Set on June 26 |publisher=Usmint.com |date=June 19, 2012 |accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\nEarly releases of the Washington coin included [[error coins]] shipped primarily from the Philadelphia mint to Florida and Tennessee banks. Highly sought after by collectors, and trading for as much as $850 each within a week of discovery, the error coins were identified by the absence of the edge impressions \"E PLURIBUS UNUM IN GOD WE TRUST 2007 P\". The mint of origin is generally accepted to be mostly Philadelphia, although identifying the source mint is impossible without opening a mint pack also containing marked units. Edge lettering is minted in both orientations with respect to \"heads\", some amateur collectors were initially duped into buying \"upside down lettering error\" coins.<ref>[http://ap.washingtontimes.com/dynamic/stories/G/GODLESS_DOLLARS Godless Dollars]{{dead link|date=March 2018}}</ref> Some cynics also erroneously point out that the Federal Reserve makes more profit from dollar bills than dollar coins because they wear out in a few years, whereas coins are more permanent. The fallacy of this argument arises because new notes printed to replace worn out notes, which have been withdrawn from circulation, bring in no net revenue to the government to offset the costs of printing new notes and destroying the old ones. As most [[vending machines]] are incapable of making change in [[banknotes]], they commonly accept only $1 bills, though a few will give change in dollar coins.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n===Mint marks===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Mint\n!Mint mark\n!Metal minted\n!Year established\n!Current status\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"| [[Denver Mint|Denver]]\n|bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"| D\n|bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"| All metals\n|bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"| 1906\n|bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"| Facility open\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"| [[Philadelphia Mint|Philadelphia]]\n|bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"| P ''or'' ''none''{{refn| group = lower-alpha | The letter \"P\" is used for the Philadelphia mint mark on all coins (except cents) released from 1980 onward.

Notes above the $100 denomination stopped being printed in 1946 and were officially withdrawn from circulation in 1969. These notes were used primarily in inter-bank transactions or by [[organized crime]]; it was the latter usage that prompted President [[Richard Nixon]] to issue an executive order in 1969 halting their use. With the advent of electronic banking, they became less necessary. Notes in denominations of $500, $1,000, $5,000, $10,000, and $100,000 were all produced at one time; see [[large denomination bills in U.S. currency]] for details. With the exception of the $100,000 bill (which was only issued as a Series 1934 Gold Certificate and was never publicly circulated; thus it is illegal to own), these notes are now collectors' items and are worth more than their face value to collectors.\n\nThough still predominantly green, post-2004 series incorporate other colors to better distinguish different denominations. As a result of a 2008 decision in an accessibility lawsuit filed by the [[American Council of the Blind]], the [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]] is planning to implement a raised tactile feature in the next redesign of each note, except the $1 and the current version of the $100 bill.

This money is not transferred from any existing funds\u2014it is at this point that the Federal Reserve has created new [[high-powered money]]. Commercial banks can freely withdraw in cash any excess reserves from their reserve account at the Federal Reserve. To fulfill those requests, the Federal Reserve places an order for printed money from the U.S. Treasury Department.<ref>{{cite web |title=Fact Sheets: Currency & Coins |publisher=United States Department of the Treasury |url=https://www.treasury.gov/about/education/Pages/edu_fact-sheets_currency_index.aspx |accessdate=October 17, 2018 }}</ref> The Treasury Department in turn sends these requests to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (to print new [[Federal Reserve notes|dollar bills]]) and the Bureau of the Mint (to stamp the coins).\n\nUsually, the short-term goal of open market operations is to achieve a specific short-term interest rate target. In other instances, monetary policy might instead entail the targeting of a specific exchange rate relative to some foreign currency or else relative to gold. For example, in the case of the United States the Federal Reserve targets the [[federal funds rate]], the rate at which member banks lend to one another overnight. The other primary means of conducting monetary policy include: (i) [[Discount window]] lending (as [[lender of last resort]]); (ii) Fractional deposit lending (changes in the reserve requirement); (iii) Moral suasion (cajoling certain market players to achieve specified outcomes); (iv) \"[[Open mouth operations]]\" (talking monetary policy with the market).\n\n==Value==\n{| cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"{{float right}}\"\n|+ Buying power of one U.S. dollar compared to 1775 [[Continental Currency|Continental currency]]\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0;\"\n|-\n!&nbsp;Year&nbsp;\n!style=\"width: 40pt; font-size: 95%;\"|&nbsp;Equivalent&nbsp; buying power\n|-\n|1775||&nbsp;$1.00\n|-\n|1780||&nbsp;$0.59\n|-\n|1790||&nbsp;$0.89\n|-\n|1800||&nbsp;$0.64\n|-\n|1810||&nbsp;$0.66\n|-\n|1820||&nbsp;$0.69\n|-\n|1830||&nbsp;$0.88\n|-\n|1840||&nbsp;$0.94\n|-\n|1850||&nbsp;$1.03\n|-\n|1860||&nbsp;$0.97\n|}\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0;\"\n|-\n!&nbsp;Year&nbsp;\n!style=\"width: 40pt; font-size: 95%;\"|&nbsp;Equivalent&nbsp; buying power\n|-\n|1870||&nbsp;$0.62\n|-\n|1880||&nbsp;$0.79\n|-\n|1890||&nbsp;$0.89\n|-\n|1900||&nbsp;$0.96\n|-\n|1910||&nbsp;$0.85\n|-\n|1920||&nbsp;$0.39\n|-\n|1930||&nbsp;$0.47\n|-\n|1940||&nbsp;$0.56\n|-\n|1950||&nbsp;$0.33\n|-\n|1960||&nbsp;$0.26\n|}\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0;\"\n|-\n!&nbsp;Year&nbsp;\n!style=\"width: 40pt; font-size: 95%;\"|&nbsp;Equivalent&nbsp; buying power\n|-\n|1970||&nbsp;$0.20\n|-\n|1980||&nbsp;$0.10\n|-\n|1990||&nbsp;$0.06\n|-\n|2000||&nbsp;$0.05\n|-\n|2007||&nbsp;$0.04\n|-\n|2008||&nbsp;$0.04\n|-\n|2009||&nbsp;$0.04\n|-\n|2010||&nbsp;$0.035\n|-\n|2011||&nbsp;$0.034\n|-\n|2012||&nbsp;$0.03\n|}\n|}\n\n[[File:US Consumer Price Index Graph.svg|thumb|upright=2.1|U.S. Consumer Price Index, starting from 1913]]\n\nThe 6th paragraph of [[Coinage clause|Section 8]] of Article 1 of the U.S. Constitution provides that the U.S. Congress shall have the power to \"coin money\" and to \"regulate the value\" of domestic and foreign coins.
