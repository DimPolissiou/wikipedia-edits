Rather than pre-selecting a few genes based on literature and known information at a given time, supervised learning from the entire expressed genome gives it farsighted utility as the knowledge of cancer biology evolves. Furthermore, development using ''untreated'' tumors allows physicians to know their patient\u2019s risk of recurrence, without any treatment bias or assumptions, before making a patient's treatment plan.\n\n== Clinical Utility ==\nMolecular diagnostics are used in combination with traditional clinicopathologic factors to decide on a treatment plan. MammaPrint provides a binary result, either high risk or low risk. Patients with a low risk result are unlikely to develop distant metastases and are therefore unlikely to benefit from chemotherapy. Since many breast cancers are considered genomically low-risk independent from clinicopathology, a significant number of patients can be saved from overtreatment with chemotherapy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/elaineschattner/2016/04/21/mammaprint-a-molecular-breast-cancer-test-is-having-a-moment-early-mindact-trial-results/#353722ed5b39|title=MammaPrint, Agendia's Breast Cancer Test, Is Having A U.S. Moment.

This will be a prospective observational, case-only, study of MammaPrint in patients with an Oncotype DX intermediate score (18-30). The clinical data is to be entered online. There will be two Case Report Forms (CRF). The first CRF must be completed before receiving the MammaPrint result. This CRF will capture baseline patient characteristics, pathology information, Oncotype DX score and the recommended treatment plan without knowing the MammaPrint result. The second CRF will be completed within 4 weeks after receiving the MammaPrint result and will capture the recommended treatment based on MammaPrint. It is expected that approximately 20-30 institutions in the US will participate. Around 300 patients will be enrolled in 2 years.\n\nThis study has the following objectives:\n\n* Describe the frequency of chemotherapy + endocrine versus endocrine alone decisions in Oncotype DX intermediate score patients\n* Assess the impact of MammaPrint on chemotherapy + endocrine versus endocrine alone treatment decisions\n* Assess the distribution of MammaPrint Low and High Risk in patients with an intermediate recurrence score\n* Assess concordance of TargetPrint ER, PR and Her2 results with Oncotype DX ER, PR and Her2 and with locally assessed IHC/FISH ER, PR and Her2\n* Compare clinical subtype based on IHC/FISH ER, PR, Her2 and Ki-67 (if available) with BluePrint molecular subtype\n\n===I-SPY I and I-SPY II===\n(CALGB 150007/150012 & ACRIN 6657)\n\nAgendia\u2019s MammaPrint signature and its [[microarray technology]] are integral components of [[Biomarker (medicine)|biomarker]] analysis and molecular prediction in the landmark [[National Cancer Institute]] supported I-SPY I and [http://www.ispytrials.org/home II I-SPY II] breast cancer clinical trials which focus on the prediction of therapeutic response in the neoadjuvant setting.

Patients with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) are often treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy to shrink the tumor before definitive surgery is performed.  This allows oncologists to measure a patients response to a given chemotherapy regimen in vivo.  Achievement of a complete pathologic response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy allows for a better prediction of the prospect for a favorable outcome.\n\nGenomics assays that measure specific gene expression patterns in a patient's primary tumor have become important prognostic tools for breast cancer patients.  This study is designed to test the ability of MammaPrint\u00ae in combination with TargetPrint\u00ae, BluePrint\u00ae, and TheraPrint\u00ae, as well as traditional pathologic and clinical prognostic factors, to predict responsiveness to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with LABC.\n\nThis study has the following objectives:''\n\n* To determine the predictive power of chemosensitivity of the combination of MammaPrint and BluePrint as measured by pCR.\n* To compare TargetPrint single gene read out of ER, PR and HER2 with local and centralized IHC and/or CISH/FISH assessment of ER, PR and HER2.\n* To identify possible correlations between the TheraPrint Research Gene Panel outcomes and chemoresponsiveness.\n* To identify and/or validate predictive gene expression profiles of clinical response/resistance to chemotherapy.\n* To compare the three BluePrint molecular subtype categories with IHC-based subtype classification.\n\n=== NBRST ===\n\nProspective neo-adjuvant REGISTRY trial linking MammaPrint, Subtyping and treatment response: Neoadjuvant Breast Registry - Symphony\u2122 Trial [https://web.archive.org/web/20121105012019/http://www.agendia.com/pages/nbrst/479.php (NBRST)] (pronounced \u201cin breast\u201d.)  This is a prospective observational, case-only, study linking MammaPrint, BluePrint, TargetPrint, TheraPrint and possible additional profiles of interest to treatment response, Recurrence Free Survival (RFS) and Distant Metastases Free Survival (DMFS). Only patients who receive neo-adjuvant therapy can participate. For this project, approximately 20-30 institutions in the US will be invited to contribute clinical patient data from enrolled patients after a MammaPrint, TargetPrint, BluePrint and TheraPrint test has been successfully performed and the patient has started neo-adjuvant therapy. Treatment is at the discretion of the physician, adhering to NCCN approved regimens or a recognized alternative.\n\nThe clinical data is to be entered online at 4 time points; amounting to four Case Report Forms (CRFs). Data will be collected on an ongoing basis, the first CRF must be completed within 6 weeks after the MammaPrint, BluePrint, TargetPrint, and TheraPrint result was provided. The second CRF should be completed by 4 weeks after definitive surgery. CRF 3 and CRF4 will be completed 2-3 and 5 years after surgery. It is expected that we will enroll around 500 patients in 4 years.\n\nThis registry study has the following objectives:''\n* Measure chemosensitivity (as defined by pCR) or endocrine sensitivity (as defined by decrease in longest tumor diameter or RCB1) in the molecular subgroups as determined by combining MammaPrint and BluePrint results.\n* Correlate chemosensitivity (as defined by pCR) to TheraPrint Therapy Gene Assay results.\n* Compare local IHC and FISH results (if available) with TargetPrint results.\n* Compare the three BluePrint molecular subgroups with IHC-based subtype classification.\n* Document impact of MammaPrint, TargetPrint and BluePrint result on treatment decision.\n* Assess the 2-3 and 5 years DMFS and RFS for the different molecular subgroups.\n* Measure chemosensitivity or endocrine sensitivity correlation with novel expression profiles.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Breast cancer classification]]\n* [[Personalized Medicine]]\n* [[Personal genomics]]\n* [[Cancer genomics]] ([[Oncogenomics]])\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.agendia.com Agendia]\n*[http://knowyourbreastcancer.com KnowYourBreastCancer.com]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{cite journal | author = Buyse M | display-authors = etal | year = 2006| title = Validation and clinical utility of a 70-gene prognostic signature for women with node-negative breast cancer | url = | journal = JNCI | volume = 98 | issue = 17| pages = 1183\u20131192 | pmid = 16954471 | doi = 10.1093/jnci/djj329 }}\n*{{cite journal | pmid = 23371464 | doi=10.1002/ijc.28082 | volume=133 | title=A prospective evaluation of a breast cancer prognosis signature in the observational RASTER study | pmc=3734625 | year=2013 | journal=Int.

Rather than pre-selecting a few genes based on literature and known information at a given time, supervised learning from the entire expressed genome gives it farsighted utility as the knowledge of cancer biology evolves. Furthermore, development using ''untreated'' tumors allows physicians to know their patient\u2019s risk of recurrence, without any treatment bias or assumptions, before making a patient's treatment plan.\n\n== Clinical Utility ==\nMolecular diagnostics are used in combination with traditional clinicopathologic factors to decide on a treatment plan. MammaPrint provides a binary result, either high risk or low risk. Patients with a low risk result are unlikely to develop distant metastases and are therefore unlikely to benefit from chemotherapy.

This will be a prospective observational, case-only, study of MammaPrint in patients with an Oncotype DX intermediate score (18-30). The clinical data is to be entered online. There will be two Case Report Forms (CRF). The first CRF must be completed before receiving the MammaPrint result. This CRF will capture baseline patient characteristics, pathology information, Oncotype DX score and the recommended treatment plan without knowing the MammaPrint result. The second CRF will be completed within 4 weeks after receiving the MammaPrint result and will capture the recommended treatment based on MammaPrint. It is expected that approximately 20-30 institutions in the US will participate. Around 300 patients will be enrolled in 2 years.\n\nThis study has the following objectives:\n\n* Describe the frequency of chemotherapy + endocrine versus endocrine alone decisions in Oncotype DX intermediate score patients\n* Assess the impact of MammaPrint on chemotherapy + endocrine versus endocrine alone treatment decisions\n* Assess the distribution of MammaPrint Low and High Risk in patients with an intermediate recurrence score\n* Assess concordance of TargetPrint ER, PR and Her2 results with Oncotype DX ER, PR and Her2 and with locally assessed IHC/FISH ER, PR and Her2\n* Compare clinical subtype based on IHC/FISH ER, PR, Her2 and Ki-67 (if available) with BluePrint molecular subtype\n\n===I-SPY I and I-SPY II===\n(CALGB 150007/150012 & ACRIN 6657)\n\nAgendia\u2019s MammaPrint signature and its [[microarray technology]] are integral components of [[Biomarker (medicine)|biomarker]] analysis and molecular prediction in the landmark [[National Cancer Institute]] supported I-SPY I and [http://www.ispytrials.org/home II I-SPY II] breast cancer clinical trials which focus on the prediction of therapeutic response in the neoadjuvant setting.

Patients with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) are often treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy to shrink the tumor before definitive surgery is performed.  This allows oncologists to measure a patients response to a given chemotherapy regimen in vivo.  Achievement of a complete pathologic response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy allows for a better prediction of the prospect for a favorable outcome.\n\nGenomics assays that measure specific gene expression patterns in a patient's primary tumor have become important prognostic tools for breast cancer patients.  This study is designed to test the ability of MammaPrint\u00ae in combination with TargetPrint\u00ae, BluePrint\u00ae, and TheraPrint\u00ae, as well as traditional pathologic and clinical prognostic factors, to predict responsiveness to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with LABC.\n\nThis study has the following objectives:''\n\n* To determine the predictive power of chemosensitivity of the combination of MammaPrint and BluePrint as measured by pCR.\n* To compare TargetPrint single gene read out of ER, PR and HER2 with local and centralized IHC and/or CISH/FISH assessment of ER, PR and HER2.\n* To identify possible correlations between the TheraPrint Research Gene Panel outcomes and chemoresponsiveness.\n* To identify and/or validate predictive gene expression profiles of clinical response/resistance to chemotherapy.\n* To compare the three BluePrint molecular subtype categories with IHC-based subtype classification.\n\n=== NBRST ===\n\nProspective neo-adjuvant REGISTRY trial linking MammaPrint, Subtyping and treatment response: Neoadjuvant Breast Registry - Symphony\u2122 Trial [https://web.archive.org/web/20121105012019/http://www.agendia.com/pages/nbrst/479.php (NBRST)] (pronounced \u201cin breast\u201d.)  This is a prospective observational, case-only, study linking MammaPrint, BluePrint, TargetPrint, TheraPrint and possible additional profiles of interest to treatment response, Recurrence Free Survival (RFS) and Distant Metastases Free Survival (DMFS). Only patients who receive neo-adjuvant therapy can participate. For this project, approximately 20-30 institutions in the US will be invited to contribute clinical patient data from enrolled patients after a MammaPrint, TargetPrint, BluePrint and TheraPrint test has been successfully performed and the patient has started neo-adjuvant therapy. Treatment is at the discretion of the physician, adhering to NCCN approved regimens or a recognized alternative.\n\nThe clinical data is to be entered online at 4 time points; amounting to four Case Report Forms (CRFs). Data will be collected on an ongoing basis, the first CRF must be completed within 6 weeks after the MammaPrint, BluePrint, TargetPrint, and TheraPrint result was provided. The second CRF should be completed by 4 weeks after definitive surgery. CRF 3 and CRF4 will be completed 2-3 and 5 years after surgery. It is expected that we will enroll around 500 patients in 4 years.\n\nThis registry study has the following objectives:''\n* Measure chemosensitivity (as defined by pCR) or endocrine sensitivity (as defined by decrease in longest tumor diameter or RCB1) in the molecular subgroups as determined by combining MammaPrint and BluePrint results.\n* Correlate chemosensitivity (as defined by pCR) to TheraPrint Therapy Gene Assay results.\n* Compare local IHC and FISH results (if available) with TargetPrint results.\n* Compare the three BluePrint molecular subgroups with IHC-based subtype classification.\n* Document impact of MammaPrint, TargetPrint and BluePrint result on treatment decision.\n* Assess the 2-3 and 5 years DMFS and RFS for the different molecular subgroups.\n* Measure chemosensitivity or endocrine sensitivity correlation with novel expression profiles.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Breast cancer classification]]\n* [[Personalized Medicine]]\n* [[Personal genomics]]\n* [[Cancer genomics]] ([[Oncogenomics]])\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.agendia.com Agendia]\n*[http://knowyourbreastcancer.com KnowYourBreastCancer.com]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\nBuyse M. et al.

The substance can be solid particles, liquid droplets, or gases. A pollutant can be of natural origin or man-made.\nPollutants are classified as primary or secondary. Primary pollutants are usually produced by processes such as ash from a volcanic eruption. Other examples include [[carbon monoxide]] gas from motor vehicle exhausts or [[sulfur dioxide]] released from factories. Secondary pollutants are not emitted directly. Rather, they form in the air when primary pollutants react or interact. [[Ground level ozone]] is a prominent example of a secondary pollutant. Some pollutants may be both primary and secondary: they are both emitted directly and formed from other primary pollutants.\n[[File:Air pollution by industrial chimneys.jpg|thumb|Before [[flue-gas desulfurization]] was installed, the emissions from this power plant in [[New Mexico]] contained excessive amounts of [[sulfur dioxide]].]]\n\n[[File:Air Pollution-Causes&Effects.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|Schematic drawing, causes and effects of air pollution: (1) [[greenhouse effect]], (2) [[Particulate pollution|particulate contamination]], (3) increased [[UV radiation]], (4) [[acid rain]], (5) increased [[ground-level ozone]] concentration, (6) increased levels of [[nitrogen oxides]].]]\n[[File:Thermal-oxidizer-rto.jpg|thumb|[[Thermal oxidiser]]s are air pollution abatement options for [[hazardous air pollutant]]s (HAPs), [[volatile organic compounds]] (VOCs), and odorous emissions]]\n\nPollutants emitted into the atmosphere by human activity include:\n\n* [[Carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}}) \u2013 Because of its role as a [[greenhouse gas]] it has been described as \"the leading pollutant\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Air Pollution Causes, Effects, and Solutions|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/pollution/|publisher=National Geographic|date=9 October 2016}}</ref> and \"the worst climate pollutant\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Vaidyanathan, ClimateWire|first1=Gayathri|title=The Worst Climate Pollution Is Carbon Dioxide|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-worst-climate-pollution-is-carbon-dioxide/|publisher=Scientific American}}</ref> Carbon dioxide is a natural component of the  atmosphere, essential for plant life and given off by the human [[respiratory system]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Keith|title=How Carbon Dioxide Became a 'Pollutant'|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124001537515830975|website=Wall Street Journal|date=18 April 2009}}</ref> This question of terminology has practical effects, for example as determining whether the U.S. [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] is deemed to regulate {{CO2}} emissions.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Barbalace|first1=Roberta C.|title=CO2 Pollution and Global Warming: When does carbon dioxide become a pollutant?|url=https://environmentalchemistry.com/yogi/environmental/200611CO2globalwarming.html|date=November 7, 2006|website=Environmentalchemistry.com}}</ref> {{CO2}} currently forms about 410 parts per million (ppm) of earth's atmosphere, compared to about 280 ppm in pre-industrial times,<ref>{{cite web|title=Graphic: The relentless rise of carbon dioxide|url=https://climate.nasa.gov/climate_resources/24/|website=Climate Change: Vital Signs of the Planet|publisher=NASA}}</ref> and billions of metric tons of {{CO2}} are emitted annually by burning of [[fossil fuels]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = How much of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions are associated with electricity generation?|url = http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=77&t=11|accessdate = 2016-12-16}}</ref> {{CO2}} increase in earth's atmosphere has been accelerating.<ref name=\"MaunaMonthly\">{{cite web|title=Full Mauna Loa CO2 record|url=https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/full.html|website=Earth System Research Laboratory|accessdate=10 January 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Sulfur oxide]]s (SO<sub>x</sub>) \u2013 particularly sulfur dioxide, a chemical compound with the formula SO<sub>2</sub>. SO<sub>2</sub> is produced by volcanoes and in various industrial processes. Coal and petroleum often contain sulfur compounds, and their combustion generates sulfur dioxide. Further oxidation of SO<sub>2</sub>, usually in the presence of a catalyst such as NO<sub>2</sub>, forms H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and thus [[acid rain]] is formed.[2] This is one of the causes for concern over the environmental impact of the use of these fuels as power sources.\n* [[Nitrogen oxide]]s (NO<sub>x</sub>) \u2013 Nitrogen oxides, particularly [[nitrogen dioxide]], are expelled from high temperature combustion, and are also produced during [[thunderstorms]] by [[electric discharge]].

They are categorized as either methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) or non-methane (NMVOCs). Methane is an extremely efficient greenhouse gas which contributes to enhanced [[global warming]]. Other hydrocarbon VOCs are also significant greenhouse gases because of their role in creating ozone and prolonging the life of [[Atmospheric methane|methane in the atmosphere]].

The exposure to an air pollutant must integrate the concentrations of the air pollutant with respect to the time spent in each setting and the respective inhalation rates for each subgroup for each specific time that the subgroup is in the setting and engaged in particular activities (playing, cooking, reading, working, spending time in traffic, etc.). For example, a small child's inhalation rate will be less than that of an adult. A child engaged in vigorous exercise will have a higher respiration rate than the same child in a sedentary activity. The daily exposure, then, needs to reflect the time spent in each micro-environmental setting and the type of activities in these settings. The air pollutant concentration in each microactivity/microenvironmental setting is summed to indicate the exposure.<ref name=\"Daniel A. Vallero\"/> For some pollutants such as [[black carbon]], traffic related exposures may dominate total exposure despite short exposure times since high concentrations coincide with proximity to major roads or participation to (motorized) traffic.<ref name=\"Dons et al.\">{{cite journal| last = Dons| first = E|title = Impact of time-activity patterns on personal exposure to black carbon| journal = Atmospheric Environment| volume = 45  | issue = 21  | pages = 3594\u20133602  | year = 2011  | doi = 10.1016/j.atmosenv.2011.03.064| bibcode = 2011AtmEn..45.3594D}}</ref> A large portion of total daily exposure occurs as short peaks of high concentrations, but it remains unclear how to define peaks and determine their frequency and health impact.<ref name=\"Dons et al. 2019\">{{cite journal\n  | last = Dons  | first = E  | title = Transport most likely to cause air pollution peak exposures in everyday life: Evidence from over 2000 days of personal monitoring\n  | journal = Atmospheric Environment  | volume = 213  | pages = 424\u2013432  | year = 2019\n  | doi = 10.1016/j.atmosenv.2019.06.035| bibcode = 2019AtmEn.213..424D }}</ref>\n\n==Indoor air quality==\n{{main|Indoor air quality}}\n\n[[File:New Delhi Met Office, India 02.jpg|thumb|Air quality monitoring, [[New Delhi, India]].]]\n\nA lack of ventilation indoors concentrates air pollution where people often spend the majority of their time. [[Radon]] (Rn) gas, a [[carcinogen]], is exuded from the Earth in certain locations and trapped inside houses. Building materials including [[carpet]]ing and [[plywood]] emit [[formaldehyde]] (H<sub>2</sub>CO) gas. Paint and solvents give off [[volatile organic compounds]] (VOCs) as they dry. [[Lead]] paint can degenerate into [[dust]] and be inhaled. Intentional air pollution is introduced with the use of [[air freshener]]s, [[incense]], and other scented items. Controlled wood fires in stoves and [[fireplace]]s can add significant amounts of smoke particulates into the air, inside and out.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://sapiens.revues.org/index130.html |title=Indoor air pollution, health and economic well-being |journal=S.A.P.I.EN.S |volume=1 |issue=1  |date= 2008-11-26|accessdate=2010-08-29|last1=Duflo |first1=Esther |last2=Greenstone |first2=Michael |last3=Hanna |first3=Rema }}</ref> Indoor pollution fatalities may be caused by using [[pesticide]]s and other chemical sprays indoors without proper ventilation.\n\nCarbon monoxide poisoning and fatalities are often caused by faulty vents and chimneys, or by the burning of [[charcoal]] indoors or in a confined space, such as a tent.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bucknell tent death: Hannah Thomas-Jones died from carbon monoxide poisoning|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-21059594|accessdate=22 September 2015|publisher=BBC News|date=17 January 2013}}</ref> Chronic [[carbon monoxide poisoning]] can result even from poorly-adjusted [[pilot light]]s. Traps are built into all domestic [[plumbing]] to keep sewer gas and [[hydrogen sulfide]], out of interiors. Clothing emits [[tetrachloroethylene]], or other dry cleaning fluids, for days after [[dry cleaning]].\n\nThough its use has now been banned in many countries, the extensive use of [[asbestos]] in industrial and domestic environments in the past has left a potentially very dangerous material in many localities. [[Asbestosis]] is a chronic [[Inflammation|inflammatory]] medical condition affecting the tissue of the [[lung]]s. It occurs after long-term, heavy exposure to asbestos from asbestos-containing materials in structures. Sufferers have severe [[dyspnea]] (shortness of breath) and are at an increased risk regarding several different types of [[lung cancer]]. As clear explanations are not always stressed in non-technical literature, care should be taken to distinguish between several forms of relevant diseases. According to the [https://web.archive.org/web/20110524203454/http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0015/123072/AQG2ndEd_6_2_asbestos.PDF World Health Organization (WHO)], these may defined as; [[asbestosis]], ''lung cancer'', and ''[[Peritoneal Mesothelioma]]'' (generally a very rare form of cancer, when more widespread it is almost always associated with prolonged exposure to asbestos).\n\nBiological sources of air pollution are also found indoors, as gases and airborne particulates. [[Pet]]s produce dander, people produce dust from minute skin flakes and decomposed hair, [[House dust mite|dust mites]] in bedding, carpeting and furniture produce enzymes and micrometre-sized fecal droppings, inhabitants emit methane, [[mold]] forms on walls and generates [[mycotoxins]] and spores, [[air conditioning]] systems can incubate [[Legionellosis|Legionnaires' disease]] and mold, and [[houseplant]]s, soil and surrounding [[gardens]] can produce [[pollen]], dust, and mold. Indoors, the lack of air circulation allows these airborne pollutants to accumulate more than they would otherwise occur in nature.\n\n==Health effects==\n{{see also|Neuroplastic effects of pollution}}\nIn 2012, air pollution caused premature deaths on average of 1 year in Europe, and was a significant [[risk factor]] for a number of [[List of pollution-related diseases|pollution-related diseases]], including [[respiratory infection]]s, [[heart disease]], [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|COPD]], [[stroke]] and [[lung cancer]].<ref name=WHO2014/> The health effects caused by air pollution may include difficulty in breathing, wheezing, coughing, [[asthma]] and worsening of existing respiratory and cardiac conditions. These effects can result in increased medication use, increased doctor or [[emergency department]] visits, more hospital admissions and premature death. The human health effects of poor air quality are far reaching, but principally affect the body's respiratory system and the cardiovascular system. Individual reactions to air pollutants depend on the type of pollutant a person is exposed to, the degree of exposure, and the individual's health status and genetics.<ref name=\"Daniel A.

In most developed countries, land-use planning is an important part of social policy, ensuring that land is used efficiently for the benefit of the wider economy and population, as well as to protect the environment.\n\nBecause a large share of air pollution is caused by combustion of [[fossil fuels]] such as [[coal]] and [[oil]], the reduction of these fuels can reduce air pollution drastically. Most effective is the switch to clean power sources such as [[wind power]], [[solar power]], [[hydro power]] which don't cause air pollution.<ref name=\"Jacobson\" /> Efforts to reduce pollution from mobile sources includes primary regulation (many developing countries have permissive regulations),{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} expanding regulation to new sources (such as cruise and transport ships, farm equipment, and small gas-powered equipment such as [[string trimmer]]s, [[chainsaw]]s, and [[snowmobiles]]), increased fuel efficiency (such as through the use of [[hybrid vehicle]]s), conversion to cleaner fuels or conversion to [[electric vehicle]]s.\n\n[[Titanium dioxide]] has been researched for its ability to reduce air pollution.

Electrostatic precipitators are highly efficient filtration devices that minimally impede the flow of gases through the device, and can easily remove fine particulates such as dust and smoke from the air stream.\n** [[Dust collector#Types of baghouses|Baghouses]] Designed to handle heavy dust loads, a dust collector consists of a blower, dust filter, a filter-cleaning system, and a dust receptacle or dust removal system (distinguished from air cleaners which utilize disposable filters to remove the dust).\n** [[Wet scrubber|Particulate scrubbers]] Wet scrubber is a form of pollution control technology. The term describes a variety of devices that use pollutants from a furnace flue gas or from other gas streams. In a wet scrubber, the polluted gas stream is brought into contact with the scrubbing liquid, by spraying it with the liquid, by forcing it through a pool of liquid, or by some other contact method, so as to remove the pollutants.\n* '''[[Scrubber]]s'''\n** [[Baffle spray scrubber]]\n** [[Cyclonic spray scrubber]]\n** [[Ejector venturi scrubber]]\n** [[Mechanically aided scrubber]]\n** [[Spray tower]]\n** [[Wet scrubber]]\n* '''[[Nitrogen oxide|NOx control]]'''\n** [[LO-NOx burner|Low NOx burners]]\n** [[Selective catalytic reduction]] (SCR)\n** [[Selective non-catalytic reduction]] (SNCR)\n** [[Wet scrubber|NOx scrubbers]]\n** [[Exhaust gas recirculation]]\n** [[Catalytic converter]] (also for VOC control)\n* '''[[Volatile organic compound|VOC abatement]]'''\n** [[Adsorption|Adsorption systems]], using [[activated carbon]], such as [[Fluidized bed concentrator|Fluidized Bed Concentrator]]\n** [[Gas flare|Flares]]\n** [[Thermal oxidizer]]s\n** [[Catalytic converter]]s\n** [[Biofilter]]s\n** [[Wet scrubber|Absorption (scrubbing)]]\n** [[Cryogenic]] [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condensers]]\n** [[Vapor recovery|Vapor recovery systems]]\n* '''[[Acid gas|Acid Gas]]/[[sulfur dioxide|SO<sub>2</sub>]] control'''\n** [[Wet scrubber]]s\n** [[Scrubber#Dry scrubbing|Dry scrubbers]]\n** [[Flue-gas desulfurization]]\n* '''[[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] control'''\n** Sorbent Injection Technology\n** Electro-Catalytic Oxidation (ECO)\n** K-Fuel\n* '''[[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|Dioxin]] and [[furan]] control'''\n* '''Miscellaneous associated equipment'''\n** Source capturing systems\n** [[Continuous emissions monitoring system]]s (CEMS)\n{{colend}}\n\n==Regulations==\n\n[[File:Cairo in smog.jpg|thumb|Smog in [[Cairo]]]]\n{{main|Air quality law}}\nIn general, there are two types of air quality standards. The first class of standards (such as the U.S. [[National Ambient Air Quality Standards]] and E.U. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110511090225/http://ec.europa.eu/environment/air/quality/legislation/directive.htm Air Quality Directive]) set maximum atmospheric concentrations for specific pollutants. Environmental agencies enact regulations which are intended to result in attainment of these target levels. The second class (such as the North American [[air quality index]]) take the form of a scale with various thresholds, which is used to communicate to the public the relative risk of outdoor activity. The scale may or may not distinguish between different pollutants.\n\n===Canada===\nIn Canada, air pollution and associated health risks are measured with the [[Air Quality Health Index (Canada)|Air Quality Health Index]] or (AQHI). It is a health protection tool used to make decisions to reduce short-term exposure to air pollution by adjusting activity levels during increased levels of air pollution.\n\nThe Air Quality Health Index or \"AQHI\" is a federal program jointly coordinated by [[Health Canada]] and [[Environment Canada]]. However, the AQHI program would not be possible without the commitment and support of the provinces, municipalities and NGOs. From air quality monitoring to health risk communication and community engagement, local partners are responsible for the vast majority of work related to AQHI implementation. The AQHI provides a number from 1 to 10+ to indicate the level of health risk associated with local air quality. Occasionally, when the amount of air pollution is abnormally high, the number may exceed 10. The AQHI provides a local air quality current value as well as a local air quality maximums forecast for today, tonight and tomorrow and provides associated health advice.\n\n{|  style=\"margin:auto; background:Black; color:White;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|  style=\"width:35px; height:35px; background:#9cf;\"| '''1''' ||  style=\"text-align:center; width:35px; height:35px; background:#6cf;\"| '''2''' ||  style=\"text-align:center; width:35px; height:35px; background:#0cf;\"| '''3''' ||  style=\"text-align:center; width:35px; height:35px; background:#9cc;\"| '''4''' ||  style=\"height:35px; height:35px; text-align:center; width:35px; text-align:center; width:35px; background:#999;\"| '''5''' ||  style=\"text-align:center; width:35px; height:35px; background:#996;\"| '''6''' ||  style=\"text-align:center; width:35px; height:35px; background:#960;\"| '''7''' ||  style=\"text-align:center; width:35px; height:35px; background:#963;\"| '''8''' ||  style=\"width:18px; width:35px; text-align:center; text-align:center; height:35px; background:#930;\"| '''9'''||  style=\"width:18px; width:35px; text-align:center; text-align:center; height:35px; background:#600;\"| '''10''' ||  style=\"text-align:center; width:35px; height:35px; background:#f00;\"| '''+'''\n|}\n{|  style=\"margin:auto; background:white; color:black;\"\n|-\n||'''Risk:'''|| Low '''(1-\u20133)'''|| Moderate '''(4-\u20136)'''|| High '''(7-\u201310)''' || Very high '''(above 10)'''\n|}\n\nAs it is now known that even low levels of air pollution can trigger discomfort for the sensitive population, the index has been developed as a continuum: The higher the number, the greater the health risk and need to take precautions. The index describes the level of health risk associated with this number as 'low', 'moderate', 'high' or 'very high', and suggests steps that can be taken to reduce exposure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/cas-aqhi/default.asp?lang=En&n=065BE995-1 |title=Environment Canada \u2013 Air Quality |website=Ec.gc.ca |date=2007-09-10 |accessdate=2011-11-11}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Significantly, all three of these pollutants can pose health risks, even at low levels of exposure, especially among those with pre-existing health problems.\n\nWhen developing the AQHI, Health Canada's original analysis of health effects included five major air pollutants: particulates, [[ozone]], and [[nitrogen dioxide]] (NO2), as well as [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO<sub>2</sub>), and [[carbon monoxide]] (CO). The latter two pollutants provided little information in predicting health effects and were removed from the AQHI formulation.\n\nThe AQHI does not measure the effects of odour, [[pollen]], dust, heat or humidity.\n\n===Germany===\n\n[[TA Luft]] is the German air quality regulation.\n\n==Hotspots==\n{{Main|Toxic Hotspots}}\n\nAir pollution hotspots are areas where air pollution emissions expose individuals to increased negative health effects.<ref>{{cite web|title=Air pollution hot spot|url=http://www.greenfacts.org/glossary/abc/air-pollution-hot-spot.htm|accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref> They are particularly common in highly populated, urban areas, where there may be a combination of stationary sources (e.g. industrial facilities) and mobile sources (e.g. cars and trucks) of pollution. Emissions from these sources can cause respiratory disease, childhood asthma, cancer, and other health problems. Fine particulate matter such as diesel soot, which contributes to more than 3.2 million premature deaths around the world each year, is a significant problem. It is very small and can lodge itself within the lungs and enter the bloodstream. Diesel soot is concentrated in densely populated areas, and one in six people in the U.S. live near a diesel pollution hot spot.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pettit|first=David|title=Global Toll of Air Pollution: Over 3 Million Deaths Each Year|publisher=Switchboard NRDC|url=http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/dpettit/global_toll_of_air_pollution_o.html|date=14 December 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508061609/http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/dpettit/global_toll_of_air_pollution_o.html|archivedate=8 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n{{ external media\n| width  = 220px\n| video1 = [https://airvisual.com/earth ''AirVisual Earth''] \u2013 realtime map of global wind and air pollution <ref>[http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/11/watch-air-pollution-flow-across-planet-real-time Watch air pollution flow across the planet in real time] ''Science Magazine News'', 28 November 2016.</ref>\n}}\n\nWhile air pollution hotspots affect a variety of populations, some groups are more likely to be located in hotspots. Previous studies have shown disparities in exposure to pollution by race and/or income. Hazardous land uses (toxic storage and disposal facilities, manufacturing facilities, major roadways) tend to be located where property values and income levels are low. Low socioeconomic status can be a proxy for other kinds of [[social vulnerability]], including race, a lack of ability to influence regulation and a lack of ability to move to neighborhoods with less environmental pollution.

They can be seen as a brown [[haze]] dome above or a [[plume (hydrodynamics)|plume]] downwind of cities. Nitrogen dioxide is a chemical compound with the formula NO<sub>2</sub>. It is one of several nitrogen oxides. One of the most prominent air pollutants, this reddish-brown toxic gas has a characteristic sharp, biting odor.\n* [[Carbon monoxide]] (CO) \u2013 CO is a colorless, odorless, toxic gas.<ref>{{Cite Web|url=https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/carbon-monoxide-poisoning/|title=Carbon Monoxide Poisoning \u2013 NHS|date=2017-10-17}}</ref> It is a product of [[combustion]] of fuel such as natural gas, coal or wood. Vehicular exhaust contributes to the majority of carbon monoxide let into our atmosphere. It creates a smog type formation in the air that has been linked to many lung diseases and disruptions to the natural environment and animals.\n* [[Volatile organic compounds]] (VOC) \u2013 VOCs are a well-known outdoor air pollutant. They are categorized as either methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) or non-methane (NMVOCs). Methane is an extremely efficient greenhouse gas which contributes to enhanced [[global warming]]. Other hydrocarbon VOCs are also significant greenhouse gases because of their role in creating ozone and prolonging the life of [[Atmospheric methane|methane in the atmosphere]]. This effect varies depending on local air quality. The aromatic NMVOCs benzene, toluene and xylene are suspected carcinogens and may lead to leukemia with prolonged exposure. 1,3-butadiene is another dangerous compound often associated with industrial use.\n* [[Particulate matter]] / particles, alternatively referred to as particulate matter (PM), atmospheric particulate matter, or fine particles, are tiny particles of solid or liquid suspended in a gas. In contrast, [[aerosol]] refers to combined particles and gas. Some particulates occur naturally, originating from volcanoes, dust storms, forest and grassland fires, living vegetation, and sea spray. Human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels in vehicles, power plants and various industrial processes also generate significant amounts of aerosols. Averaged worldwide, anthropogenic aerosols\u2014those made by human activities\u2014currently account for approximately 10 percent of our atmosphere.

This would account for daily exposure in various settings (e.g. different indoor micro-environments and outdoor locations). The exposure needs to include different age and other demographic groups, especially infants, children, pregnant women and other sensitive subpopulations. The exposure to an air pollutant must integrate the concentrations of the air pollutant with respect to the time spent in each setting and the respective inhalation rates for each subgroup for each specific time that the subgroup is in the setting and engaged in particular activities (playing, cooking, reading, working, spending time in traffic, etc.). For example, a small child's inhalation rate will be less than that of an adult. A child engaged in vigorous exercise will have a higher respiration rate than the same child in a sedentary activity. The daily exposure, then, needs to reflect the time spent in each micro-environmental setting and the type of activities in these settings. The air pollutant concentration in each microactivity/microenvironmental setting is summed to indicate the exposure.<ref name=\"Daniel A.

In most developed countries, land-use planning is an important part of social policy, ensuring that land is used efficiently for the benefit of the wider economy and population, as well as to protect the environment.\n\nBecause a large share of air pollution is caused by combustion of [[fossil fuels]] such as [[coal]] and [[oil]], the reduction of these fuels can reduce air pollution drastically. Most effective is the switch to clean power sources such as [[wind power]], [[solar power]], [[hydro power]] which don't cause air pollution.<ref name=\"Jacobson\" /> Efforts to reduce pollution from mobile sources includes primary regulation (many developing countries have permissive regulations),{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} expanding regulation to new sources (such as cruise and transport ships, farm equipment, and small gas-powered equipment such as [[string trimmer]]s, [[chainsaw]]s, and [[snowmobiles]]), increased fuel efficiency (such as through the use of [[hybrid vehicle]]s), conversion to cleaner fuels or conversion to [[electric vehicle]]s.\n\n[[Titanium dioxide]] has been researched for its ability to reduce air pollution. [[Ultraviolet]] light will release free electrons from material, thereby creating free radicals, which break up VOCs and NOx gases. One form is [[Superhydrophilicity|superhydrophilic]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15694973|author=Jason Palmer|title='Smog-eating' material breaking into the big time|date= 12 November 2011|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, [[Tony Ryan (scientist)|Prof. Tony Ryan]] and [[Simon Armitage|Prof. Simon Armitage]] of [[University of Sheffield]] prepared a 10 meter by 20 meter-sized poster coated with microscopic, pollution-eating nanoparticles of titanium dioxide.

According to a study published in [[Energy and Environmental Science]] in 2015 the switch to [[100% renewable energy]] in the United States would eliminate about 62,000 premature mortalities per year and about 42,000 in 2050, if no biomass were used. This would save about $600 billion in [[health costs]] a year due to reduced air pollution in 2050, or about 3.6% of the 2014 U.S. gross domestic product.<ref name=\"Jacobson\">[[Mark Z.

They can either destroy [[contaminant]]s or remove them from an exhaust stream before it is emitted into the atmosphere.\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* '''Particulate control'''\n** Mechanical collectors ([[Cyclonic separation|dust cyclones]], multicyclones)\n** [[Electrostatic precipitator]]s An electrostatic precipitator (ESP), or electrostatic air cleaner is a particulate collection device that removes particles from a flowing gas (such as air), using the force of an induced electrostatic charge. Electrostatic precipitators are highly efficient filtration devices that minimally impede the flow of gases through the device, and can easily remove fine particulates such as dust and smoke from the air stream.\n** [[Dust collector#Types of baghouses|Baghouses]] Designed to handle heavy dust loads, a dust collector consists of a blower, dust filter, a filter-cleaning system, and a dust receptacle or dust removal system (distinguished from air cleaners which utilize disposable filters to remove the dust).\n** [[Wet scrubber|Particulate scrubbers]] Wet scrubber is a form of pollution control technology. The term describes a variety of devices that use pollutants from a furnace flue gas or from other gas streams. In a wet scrubber, the polluted gas stream is brought into contact with the scrubbing liquid, by spraying it with the liquid, by forcing it through a pool of liquid, or by some other contact method, so as to remove the pollutants.\n* '''[[Scrubber]]s'''\n** [[Baffle spray scrubber]]\n** [[Cyclonic spray scrubber]]\n** [[Ejector venturi scrubber]]\n** [[Mechanically aided scrubber]]\n** [[Spray tower]]\n** [[Wet scrubber]]\n* '''[[Nitrogen oxide|NOx control]]'''\n** [[LO-NOx burner|Low NOx burners]]\n** [[Selective catalytic reduction]] (SCR)\n** [[Selective non-catalytic reduction]] (SNCR)\n** [[Wet scrubber|NOx scrubbers]]\n** [[Exhaust gas recirculation]]\n** [[Catalytic converter]] (also for VOC control)\n* '''[[Volatile organic compound|VOC abatement]]'''\n** [[Adsorption|Adsorption systems]], using [[activated carbon]], such as [[Fluidized bed concentrator|Fluidized Bed Concentrator]]\n** [[Gas flare|Flares]]\n** [[Thermal oxidizer]]s\n** [[Catalytic converter]]s\n** [[Biofilter]]s\n** [[Wet scrubber|Absorption (scrubbing)]]\n** [[Cryogenic]] [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condensers]]\n** [[Vapor recovery|Vapor recovery systems]]\n* '''[[Acid gas|Acid Gas]]/[[sulfur dioxide|SO<sub>2</sub>]] control'''\n** [[Wet scrubber]]s\n** [[Scrubber#Dry scrubbing|Dry scrubbers]]\n** [[Flue-gas desulfurization]]\n* '''[[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] control'''\n** Sorbent Injection Technology\n** Electro-Catalytic Oxidation (ECO)\n** K-Fuel\n* '''[[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|Dioxin]] and [[furan]] control'''\n* '''Miscellaneous associated equipment'''\n** Source capturing systems\n** [[Continuous emissions monitoring system]]s (CEMS)\n{{colend}}\n\n==Regulations==\n\n[[File:Cairo in smog.jpg|thumb|Smog in [[Cairo]]]]\n{{main|Air quality law}}\nIn general, there are two types of air quality standards. The first class of standards (such as the U.S. [[National Ambient Air Quality Standards]] and E.U. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110511090225/http://ec.europa.eu/environment/air/quality/legislation/directive.htm Air Quality Directive]) set maximum atmospheric concentrations for specific pollutants. Environmental agencies enact regulations which are intended to result in attainment of these target levels. The second class (such as the North American [[air quality index]]) take the form of a scale with various thresholds, which is used to communicate to the public the relative risk of outdoor activity. The scale may or may not distinguish between different pollutants.\n\n===Canada===\nIn Canada, air pollution and associated health risks are measured with the [[Air Quality Health Index (Canada)|Air Quality Health Index]] or (AQHI). It is a health protection tool used to make decisions to reduce short-term exposure to air pollution by adjusting activity levels during increased levels of air pollution.\n\nThe Air Quality Health Index or \"AQHI\" is a federal program jointly coordinated by [[Health Canada]] and [[Environment Canada]]. However, the AQHI program would not be possible without the commitment and support of the provinces, municipalities and NGOs. From air quality monitoring to health risk communication and community engagement, local partners are responsible for the vast majority of work related to AQHI implementation. The AQHI provides a number from 1 to 10+ to indicate the level of health risk associated with local air quality. Occasionally, when the amount of air pollution is abnormally high, the number may exceed 10. The AQHI provides a local air quality current value as well as a local air quality maximums forecast for today, tonight and tomorrow and provides associated health advice.\n\n{|  style=\"margin:auto; background:Black; color:White;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|  style=\"width:35px; height:35px; background:#9cf;\"| '''1''' ||  style=\"text-align:center; width:35px; height:35px; background:#6cf;\"| '''2''' ||  style=\"text-align:center; width:35px; height:35px; background:#0cf;\"| '''3''' ||  style=\"text-align:center; width:35px; height:35px; background:#9cc;\"| '''4''' ||  style=\"height:35px; height:35px; text-align:center; width:35px; text-align:center; width:35px; background:#999;\"| '''5''' ||  style=\"text-align:center; width:35px; height:35px; background:#996;\"| '''6''' ||  style=\"text-align:center; width:35px; height:35px; background:#960;\"| '''7''' ||  style=\"text-align:center; width:35px; height:35px; background:#963;\"| '''8''' ||  style=\"width:18px; width:35px; text-align:center; text-align:center; height:35px; background:#930;\"| '''9'''||  style=\"width:18px; width:35px; text-align:center; text-align:center; height:35px; background:#600;\"| '''10''' ||  style=\"text-align:center; width:35px; height:35px; background:#f00;\"| '''+'''\n|}\n{|  style=\"margin:auto; background:white; color:black;\"\n|-\n||'''Risk:'''|| Low '''(1-\u20133)'''|| Moderate '''(4-\u20136)'''|| High '''(7-\u201310)''' || Very high '''(above 10)'''\n|}\n\nAs it is now known that even low levels of air pollution can trigger discomfort for the sensitive population, the index has been developed as a continuum: The higher the number, the greater the health risk and need to take precautions. The index describes the level of health risk associated with this number as 'low', 'moderate', 'high' or 'very high', and suggests steps that can be taken to reduce exposure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/cas-aqhi/default.asp?lang=En&n=065BE995-1 |title=Environment Canada \u2013 Air Quality |website=Ec.gc.ca |date=2007-09-10 |accessdate=2011-11-11}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Significantly, all three of these pollutants can pose health risks, even at low levels of exposure, especially among those with pre-existing health problems.\n\nWhen developing the AQHI, Health Canada's original analysis of health effects included five major air pollutants: particulates, [[ozone]], and [[nitrogen dioxide]] (NO2), as well as [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO<sub>2</sub>), and [[carbon monoxide]] (CO). The latter two pollutants provided little information in predicting health effects and were removed from the AQHI formulation.\n\nThe AQHI does not measure the effects of odour, [[pollen]], dust, heat or humidity.\n\n===Germany===\n\n[[TA Luft]] is the German air quality regulation.\n\n==Hotspots==\n{{Main|Toxic Hotspots}}\n\nAir pollution hotspots are areas where air pollution emissions expose individuals to increased negative health effects.<ref>{{cite web|title=Air pollution hot spot|url=http://www.greenfacts.org/glossary/abc/air-pollution-hot-spot.htm|accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref> They are particularly common in highly populated, urban areas, where there may be a combination of stationary sources (e.g. industrial facilities) and mobile sources (e.g. cars and trucks) of pollution. Emissions from these sources can cause respiratory disease, childhood asthma, cancer, and other health problems. Fine particulate matter such as diesel soot, which contributes to more than 3.2 million premature deaths around the world each year, is a significant problem. It is very small and can lodge itself within the lungs and enter the bloodstream. Diesel soot is concentrated in densely populated areas, and one in six people in the U.S. live near a diesel pollution hot spot.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pettit|first=David|title=Global Toll of Air Pollution: Over 3 Million Deaths Each Year|publisher=Switchboard NRDC|url=http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/dpettit/global_toll_of_air_pollution_o.html|date=14 December 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508061609/http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/dpettit/global_toll_of_air_pollution_o.html|archivedate=8 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n{{ external media\n| width  = 220px\n| video1 = [https://airvisual.com/earth ''AirVisual Earth''] \u2013 realtime map of global wind and air pollution <ref>[http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/11/watch-air-pollution-flow-across-planet-real-time Watch air pollution flow across the planet in real time] ''Science Magazine News'', 28 November 2016.</ref>\n}}\n\nWhile air pollution hotspots affect a variety of populations, some groups are more likely to be located in hotspots. Previous studies have shown disparities in exposure to pollution by race and/or income. Hazardous land uses (toxic storage and disposal facilities, manufacturing facilities, major roadways) tend to be located where property values and income levels are low. Low socioeconomic status can be a proxy for other kinds of [[social vulnerability]], including race, a lack of ability to influence regulation and a lack of ability to move to neighborhoods with less environmental pollution. These communities bear a disproportionate burden of environmental pollution and are more likely to face health risks such as cancer or asthma.<ref name=\"Drury\">{{cite journal|last=Drury|first=Richard|last2=Belliveau|first2=Michael|last3=Kuhn|first3=J Scott|last4=Shipra|first4=Bansal|title=Pollution Trading and Environmental Justice: Los Angeles' Failed Experiment in Air Pollution Policy|journal=Duke Environmental Law & Policy Forum|date=Spring 1999|volume=9|issue=231}}</ref>\n\nStudies show that patterns in race and income disparities not only indicate a higher exposure to pollution but also higher risk of adverse health outcomes.<ref name=\"Morello-Frosch 2011\">{{cite journal|last=Morello-Frosch|first=Rachel|last2=Zuk|first2=Miriam|last3=Jerrett|first3=Michael|last4=Shamasunder|first4=Bhavna|last5=Kyle|first5=Amy D.|title=Understanding the Cumulative Impacts of Inequalities in Environmental Health: Implications for Policy|journal=Health Affairs|year=2011|volume=30|issue=5| doi = 10.1377/hlthaff.2011.0153|pmid=21555471|pages=879\u201387|doi-access=free}}</ref> Communities characterized by low socioeconomic status and racial minorities can be more vulnerable to cumulative adverse health impacts resulting from elevated exposure to pollutants than more privileged communities.<ref name=\"Morello-Frosch 2011\"/> Blacks and Latinos generally face more pollution than whites and Asians, and low-income communities bear a higher burden of risk than affluent ones.<ref name=\"Drury\"/> Racial discrepancies are particularly distinct in suburban areas of the [[Southern United States]] and metropolitan areas of the [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] and [[Western United States]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Racial and Socioeocnomic Disparities in Residential Proximity|journal=American Journal of Public Health|year=2009|volume=99|issue=3|doi=10.2105/ajph.2007.131383|pages=S649\u201356|pmid=19890171|pmc=2774179 | last1 = Mohai | first1 = P | last2 = Lantz | first2 = PM | last3 = Morenoff | first3 = J | last4 = House | first4 = JS | last5 = Mero | first5 = RP}}</ref> Residents in public housing, who are generally low-income and cannot move to healthier neighborhoods, are highly affected by nearby refineries and chemical plants.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lerner|first=Steve|journal=Port Arthur, Texas: Public Housing Residents Breathe Contaminated Air from Nearby Refineries and Chemical Plants|title=Sacrifice Zones: The Front Lines of Toxic Chemical Exposure in the United States|publisher=MIT Press|year=2010}}</ref>\n\n==Cities==\n{{see also|List of most polluted cities in the world by particulate matter concentration}}\n[[File:Global air pollution map.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Nitrogen dioxide concentrations as measured from satellite 2002\u20132004]]\n[[File:Deaths from air pollution.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Deaths from air pollution in 2004]]\nAir pollution is usually concentrated in densely populated metropolitan areas, especially in developing countries where environmental regulations are relatively lax or nonexistent.<ref>{{Cite journal | pages = 170\u201377 | last1 = Ostachuk| first1 = A. | last2 = Evelson | first2 = P. | last3 = Martin | first3 = S. | last4 = Dawidowski | first4 = L. | last5 = Yakisich | first5 = J.S. | last6 = Tasat | first6 = D.R. | title = Age-related lung cell response to urban Buenos Aires air particle soluble fraction | volume = 107 | issue = 2 | journal = Environmental Research | year = 2008 | doi=10.1016/j.envres.2008.01.007| pmid = 18313661| bibcode = 2008ER....107..170O}}</ref> However, even populated areas in developed countries attain unhealthy levels of pollution, with [[Los Angeles]] and [[Rome]] being two examples.<ref>{{Cite journal | pmc = 1757645 |jstor=27730990 | pages = 605\u201310 | last1 = Michelozzi | first1 = P. | last2 = Forastiere | first2 = F. | last3 = Fusco | first3 = D. | last4 = Perucci | first4 = C.

Cambridge award a [[Cambridge blue|blue]] for either game, though Oxford award a [[Oxford blue|blue]] for the four-day game only. At the same time, Oxford players have also played in the Oxford University Centre of Cricketing Excellence (Oxford UCCE, also including [[Oxford Brookes University]], now superseded by the [[Oxford MCC University|Oxford MCCU]]), and Cambridge players in the Cambridge University Centre of Cricketing Excellence (Cambridge UCCE, including [[Anglia Ruskin University]] and now the [[Cambridge MCC University|Cambridge MCCU]]). However, only those at Oxford and Cambridge Universities are eligible to play in the University Match(es).<ref>The Oxford and Cambridge UCCE teams were rebranded as [[Oxford MCC University|Oxford MCCU]] and [[Cambridge MCC University|Cambridge MCCU]] prior to the 2010 season.</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{further|History of English amateur cricket#University cricket from 1827 to 1863}}\n\nThe match was first played in 1827 at the instigation of [[Charles Wordsworth]] who was also responsible for founding the [[Boat Race]] in 1829. It was traditionally an annual three-day [[first-class cricket|first-class]] fixture, normally held at [[Lord's]].<ref>Until 1854, with the exceptions of 1841 and 1850, it was played over two days instead of three.</ref> From the 1830s until 1939, it was among the most important fixtures of the season, attracting large crowds and widespread press coverage.  It was still a major social, as well as sporting, event as recently as just after [[World War II]] . According to ''[[The Cricketer]]'' (1954), the 1954 match attracted over 13,000 paying spectators as well as MCC members.\n\nIn terms of the clubs concerned, the University Match is the oldest first-class fixture still being played. Matches between county teams prior to formation of the current county clubs have a longer history, with the oldest known county fixture between [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent]] and [[Surrey county cricket teams|Surrey]], which dates back to 1709 at least.\n\nThe next two University matches were in 1829 and 1836. From 1838 it has been played annually, except for the war years of 1915-1918 and 1940-45. (From 1941-45, a one-day fixture was played at Lord's, but these matches are not counted in the official records.) The first match was played at Lord's, but it was only in 1851 that Lord's became the permanent venue, five of the early matches having been played in the vicinity of Oxford.\n\nDespite never matriculating, [[Tom Wills]] was allowed to play for Cambridge in the 1856 match. He went on to found [[Australian rules football]] and coach the [[Australian Aboriginal cricket team in England in 1868|first Australian cricket team to tour England]].\n\nSome of the most dramatic matches in the long history of the fixture occurred in the 1870s. The first of these was [[Frank Cobden#The 1870 University Match|'Cobden's Match']] in 1870. [[Frank Cobden|F. C. Cobden]] took the last three Oxford wickets in consecutive balls to give Cambridge victory by 2 runs. The following year [[Samuel Butler (cricketer)|S. E. Butler]] took 10-38 in the Cambridge first innings (the only instance of a bowler taking all ten), followed by five more wickets in the second innings. In 1873 Oxford won by only three wickets. The 1875 match was almost as close an affair as that in 1870. Needing 175 to win, Cambridge were 161-7 at one point, but were all out for 168 to lose by six runs.\n\nAnother notable match was in 1923, which became known as the \"Thunderstorm match\". Oxford had run up a good score, and a torrential storm for much of the night rendered the pitch almost unplayable, so that Cambridge were quickly dismissed in two innings.\n\n[[William Yardley (cricketer)|William Yardley]] of Cambridge has the distinction of scoring the first two hundreds made in the series: 100 in 1870 in Cobden's Match and 130 in 1872.\n\n[[Robin Marlar]]'s bowling figures for Cambridge are worth noting:\n* 1951: 5-41 and 1-64\n* 1952: 7-104 and 2-25\n* 1953: 5-94 and 7-49\n\nPlayers who became (or in a few instances were already) famous to have appeared in the match include: [[Alfred Lyttelton]] (Cantab. 1876-9), [[Allan Steel]] (Cantab. 1878-81), [[Stanley Jackson]] (Cantab. 1890-3), [[C. B. Fry]] (Ox. 1892-5), [[K. S. Ranjitsinhji]] (Cantab. 1893), [[Pelham Warner]] (Ox. 1895-6), [[Gilbert Jessop]] (Cantab. 1896-9), [[Tip Foster|R. E. Foster]] (Ox. 1897-1900), [[Bernard Bosanquet (cricketer)|Bernard Bosanquet]] (Ox. 1898-1900), [[Percy Chapman]] (Cantab. 1920-2), [[Douglas Jardine]] (Ox. 1920-1, 1923), [[Gubby Allen]] (Cantab. 1922-3), [[Duleepsinhji|K. S. Duleepsinhji]] (Cantab. 1925-8), [[Iftikhar Ali Khan Pataudi|Nawab of Pataudi snr]] (Ox. 1929-31), [[Ken Farnes]] (Cantab. 1931-3), [[Martin Donnelly (cricketer)|Martin Donnelly]] (Ox. 1946-7), [[Abdul Kardar]] (Ox. 1947-9), [[Peter May (cricketer)|Peter May]] (Cantab. 1950-2), [[David Sheppard]] (Cantab. 1950-2), [[Colin Cowdrey]] (Ox. 1952-4), [[M. J. K. Smith]] (Ox. 1954-6), [[Ted Dexter]] (Cantab. 1956-8), [[Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi|Nawab of Pataudi jnr]] (Ox. 1960-1, 1963), [[Tony Lewis]] Cantab 1960-62), [[Mike Brearley]] (Cantab. 1961-4), [[Majid Khan (cricketer, born 1946)|Majid Khan]] (Cantab. 1971-3), [[Imran Khan]] (Ox. 1973-5) and [[Mike Atherton]] (Cantab. 1987, 1989). It can be seen that the majority were batsmen rather than bowlers and that the 1890s and 1950s to early 1960s were particularly fertile periods. At the time of writing, the most recent Oxbridge international cricketers are [[Ed Smith (cricketer)|Ed Smith]] (Cantab. 1996-7) in Tests, and [[Jamie Dalrymple|James Dalrymple]] (Ox. 2001-3) in limited-overs internationals.\n\nFrom 2001 the match has been replaced by two fixtures each year: a one-day match played at Lord's and a four-day first-class fixture played in alternate years at [[Fenner's]] in Cambridge and [[The Parks]] in Oxford. [[University Sporting Blue|Blues]] are awarded to those appearing in either match for Cambridge players but only to Oxford players who appear in the first-class four-day game. Unless otherwise stated, statistics quoted in this article are for the first-class fixtures only.\n\nIn 2008, for the first time a [[Twenty20]] fixture was also played.<ref>[http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/202/202742.html Scorecard of 2008 T20 fixture]</ref>\n\n== Records ==\n\n=== Results ===\nUp to and including 2019, 175 matches have been scheduled. Cambridge have won 60, Oxford have won 58, 56 have been drawn and one match (in 1988) was abandoned without a ball being bowled.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\"\n! bgcolor=\"#efefef\" colspan=6 | List of University matches\n|- bgcolor=\"#efefef\"\n!No.\n!Date\n!Venue\n!Winners \n!Winning margin\n!Notes\n|-\n|1\n|4 June 1827\n|Lord's\n|bgcolor=\"#FFEBAD\"|Drawn\n|\n|<small>2-day match;

Cambridge award a [[Cambridge blue|blue]] for either game, though Oxford award a [[Oxford blue|blue]] for the four-day game only. At the same time, Oxford players have also played in the Oxford University Centre of Cricketing Excellence (Oxford UCCE, also including [[Oxford Brookes University]], now superseded by the [[Oxford MCC University|Oxford MCCU]]), and Cambridge players in the Cambridge University Centre of Cricketing Excellence (Cambridge UCCE, including [[Anglia Ruskin University]] and now the [[Cambridge MCC University|Cambridge MCCU]]). However, only those at Oxford and Cambridge Universities are eligible to play in the University Match(es).<ref>The Oxford and Cambridge UCCE teams were rebranded as [[Oxford MCC University|Oxford MCCU]] and [[Cambridge MCC University|Cambridge MCCU]] prior to the 2010 season.</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{further|History of English amateur cricket#University cricket from 1827 to 1863}}\n\nThe match was first played in 1827 at the instigation of [[Charles Wordsworth]] who was also responsible for founding the [[Boat Race]] in 1829. It was traditionally an annual three-day [[first-class cricket|first-class]] fixture, normally held at [[Lord's]].<ref>Until 1854, with the exceptions of 1841 and 1850, it was played over two days instead of three.</ref> From the 1830s until 1939, it was among the most important fixtures of the season, attracting large crowds and widespread press coverage.  It was still a major social, as well as sporting, event as recently as just after [[World War II]] . According to ''[[The Cricketer]]'' (1954), the 1954 match attracted over 13,000 paying spectators as well as MCC members.\n\nIn terms of the clubs concerned, the University Match is the oldest first-class fixture still being played. Matches between county teams prior to formation of the current county clubs have a longer history, with the oldest known county fixture between [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent]] and [[Surrey county cricket teams|Surrey]], which dates back to 1709 at least.\n\nThe next two University matches were in 1829 and 1836. From 1838 it has been played annually, except for the war years of 1915-1918 and 1940-45. (From 1941-45, a one-day fixture was played at Lord's, but these matches are not counted in the official records.) The first match was played at Lord's, but it was only in 1851 that Lord's became the permanent venue, five of the early matches having been played in the vicinity of Oxford.\n\nDespite never matriculating, [[Tom Wills]] was allowed to play for Cambridge in the 1856 match. He went on to found [[Australian rules football]] and coach the [[Australian Aboriginal cricket team in England in 1868|first Australian cricket team to tour England]].\n\nSome of the most dramatic matches in the long history of the fixture occurred in the 1870s. The first of these was [[Frank Cobden#The 1870 University Match|'Cobden's Match']] in 1870. [[Frank Cobden|F. C. Cobden]] took the last three Oxford wickets in consecutive balls to give Cambridge victory by 2 runs. The following year [[Samuel Butler (cricketer)|S. E. Butler]] took 10-38 in the Cambridge first innings (the only instance of a bowler taking all ten), followed by five more wickets in the second innings. In 1873 Oxford won by only three wickets. The 1875 match was almost as close an affair as that in 1870. Needing 175 to win, Cambridge were 161-7 at one point, but were all out for 168 to lose by six runs.\n\nAnother notable match was in 1923, which became known as the \"Thunderstorm match\". Oxford had run up a good score, and a torrential storm for much of the night rendered the pitch almost unplayable, so that Cambridge were quickly dismissed in two innings.\n\n[[William Yardley (cricketer)|William Yardley]] of Cambridge has the distinction of scoring the first two hundreds made in the series: 100 in 1870 in Cobden's Match and 130 in 1872.\n\n[[Robin Marlar]]'s bowling figures for Cambridge are worth noting:\n* 1951: 5-41 and 1-64\n* 1952: 7-104 and 2-25\n* 1953: 5-94 and 7-49\n\nPlayers who became (or in a few instances were already) famous to have appeared in the match include: [[Alfred Lyttelton]] (Cantab. 1876-9), [[Allan Steel]] (Cantab. 1878-81), [[Stanley Jackson]] (Cantab. 1890-3), [[C. B. Fry]] (Ox. 1892-5), [[K. S. Ranjitsinhji]] (Cantab. 1893), [[Pelham Warner]] (Ox. 1895-6), [[Gilbert Jessop]] (Cantab. 1896-9), [[Tip Foster|R. E. Foster]] (Ox. 1897-1900), [[Bernard Bosanquet (cricketer)|Bernard Bosanquet]] (Ox. 1898-1900), [[Percy Chapman]] (Cantab. 1920-2), [[Douglas Jardine]] (Ox. 1920-1, 1923), [[Gubby Allen]] (Cantab. 1922-3), [[Duleepsinhji|K. S. Duleepsinhji]] (Cantab. 1925-8), [[Iftikhar Ali Khan Pataudi|Nawab of Pataudi snr]] (Ox. 1929-31), [[Ken Farnes]] (Cantab. 1931-3), [[Martin Donnelly (cricketer)|Martin Donnelly]] (Ox. 1946-7), [[Abdul Kardar]] (Ox. 1947-9), [[Peter May (cricketer)|Peter May]] (Cantab. 1950-2), [[David Sheppard]] (Cantab. 1950-2), [[Colin Cowdrey]] (Ox. 1952-4), [[M. J. K. Smith]] (Ox. 1954-6), [[Ted Dexter]] (Cantab. 1956-8), [[Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi|Nawab of Pataudi jnr]] (Ox. 1960-1, 1963), [[Tony Lewis]] Cantab 1960-62), [[Mike Brearley]] (Cantab. 1961-4), [[Majid Khan (cricketer, born 1946)|Majid Khan]] (Cantab. 1971-3), [[Imran Khan]] (Ox. 1973-5) and [[Mike Atherton]] (Cantab. 1987, 1989). It can be seen that the majority were batsmen rather than bowlers and that the 1890s and 1950s to early 1960s were particularly fertile periods. At the time of writing, the most recent Oxbridge international cricketers are [[Ed Smith (cricketer)|Ed Smith]] (Cantab. 1996-7) in Tests, and [[Jamie Dalrymple|James Dalrymple]] (Ox. 2001-3) in limited-overs internationals.\n\nFrom 2001 the match has been replaced by two fixtures each year: a one-day match played at Lord's and a four-day first-class fixture played in alternate years at [[Fenner's]] in Cambridge and [[The Parks]] in Oxford. [[University Sporting Blue|Blues]] are awarded to those appearing in either match for Cambridge players but only to Oxford players who appear in the first-class four-day game. Unless otherwise stated, statistics quoted in this article are for the first-class fixtures only.\n\nIn 2008, for the first time a [[Twenty20]] fixture was also played.<ref>[http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/202/202742.html Scorecard of 2008 T20 fixture]</ref>\n\n== Records ==\n\n=== Results ===\nUp to and including 2019, 175 matches have been scheduled. Cambridge have won 60, Oxford have won 58, 56 have been drawn and one match (in 1988) was abandoned without a ball being bowled.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\"\n! bgcolor=\"#efefef\" colspan=6 | List of University matches\n|- bgcolor=\"#efefef\"\n!No.\n!Date\n!Venue\n!Winners \n!Winning margin\n!Notes\n|-\n|1\n|4 June 1827\n|Lord's\n|bgcolor=\"#FFEBAD\"|Drawn\n|\n|<small>2-day match;

The first generation used a six-speed version, and the second generation uses a five-speed version, model 5AMT130. Input from floor-mounted shifter or optional steering-wheel-mounted paddles controls a servo-operated clutch and sequential automated gearbox. The vehicle may be driven in automatic mode (early models had the option of full automatic mode, or standard \"soft-tip\" which was manual mode indicated by no button on the gearshift) or in semi-automatic (half automatic) mode via paddle shifters, where the operator controls the shift points but cannot feather or adjust the speed of the clutch.\n\nFrom 2009, revised transmission software enabled smoother and faster gear changes. The software, available via an ECU upgrade, was also made available for 2008 second generation cars, with a new battery as required.<ref>{{cite web|last='qwcdirect' |title=SMART FOURTWO |url=http://www.houndgear.org/category/smart/ |accessdate=10 September 2010 |date=13 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228054019/http://www.houndgear.org/category/smart/ |archivedate=December 28, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last='tampasmart'|title=Do you need smart 2.0 upgrade?|url=http://www.smartcarofamerica.com/forums/f25/do-you-need-smart-2-0-upgrade-21725/|work= Smart Car of America Forums|accessdate=10 September 2010|date=4 November 2009}}</ref>\n\nThird generation models receive a five-speed manual transmission or dual clutch automated manual transmission.\n\n===Parking===\nWith an overall length (first generation: 2.5&nbsp;m (98.4&nbsp;in)) approximately equal to the width of regular parking space, a smart Fortwo can park perpendicularly in spaces typically designed for [[parallel parking]], allowing two Smarts to park in one space\u2014a manner of parking not permissible in many jurisdictions worldwide (e.g. Austria, New Zealand and California<ref>{{cite web|title=Section 22502 \u2013 Curb Parking|url=http://dmv.ca.gov/pubs/vctop/d11/vc22502.htm|work=California Vehicle Code|publisher=California DMV|accessdate=16 August 2011}}</ref>).\n\n=={{anchor|1|W450}}First generation (Build series W450, 1998\u20132007)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image = Smart Fortwo passion front.JPG\n| production = 1998\u20132007\n| name = First generation (W450)\n| aka = Smart City Coup\u00e9 (1998\u20132002)<br />Smart Fortwo (facelift)\n| body_style = 3-door [[hatchback]]\n| front_suspension =\n| rear_suspension =\n| wheelbase = {{convert|71.3|in|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| length = {{convert|98.4|in|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| width = {{convert|59.6|in|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| height = {{convert|61|in|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| weight = {{convert|1610|lb|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| engine = {{ubl\n  |0.6\u20130.7 L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M160 engine|M160]]'' [[Straight-three engine|I3]] [[turbocharger|turbo]] (petrol)\n  |0.8 L ''[[Mercedes-Benz OM660 engine|OM660]]'' [[Straight-three engine|I3]] [[turbocharger|turbo]] (diesel)\n  }}\n| transmission = 6-speed [[Semi-automatic transmission|automated manual]]\n| sp = uk\n}}\n\nThe first generation, build series W450, debuted in 1998 and received a [[facelift (automotive)|facelift]] in 2002.\n\n===Engine===\nThe engines are [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] with [[straight-3|three cylinders]].

Trim levels include the Pure, Pulse, and Passion. Pure models are fitted with the standard audio system but nothing else; Pulse models are fitted with alloy wheels, panoramic glass roof and paddle-shifters on the steering wheel (2004+); and finally, the Passion models are fitted with air-conditioning and ability to select between fully automatic and sequential gearbox.\n* '''Limited 1''': The first limited edition of which 7500 were made, all left-hand drive. It was released at the original launch in 1998. It had a black Tridion cell and white body panels. It also had alloy wheels, a Limited 1 insignia, and a blue interior with beige leather finishings. It was supplied with a certificate showing which number out of the 7500, and a plaque with this number below the windshield on the inside.\n* '''SE''': This was the second limited edition that smart made; it was sold in mid 2001 (Mk5) and all were left hand drive. They were all Pulse specification with a redesigned steering wheel, soft touch, air conditioning, CD Multichanger and drinks holder as standard. The engine power was upped to 61BHP from the standard 55BHP normally applied to the Pulse in the 600cc G1 cars. It was designated by a SE badge on the boot and was sold in Bay Grey with grey interior and dark blue twist fabric.\n* '''Cdi''': has the world's smallest production [[common rail|common-rail direct injection]] [[diesel engine]]. With a consumption of 3.3 litres ([[New European Driving Cycle|NEDC]]) per 100 kilometres (71.2 mpg) and [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] emissions of just 88&nbsp;grams per kilometre, it has the lowest current production car CO<sub>2</sub> emissions worldwide, since [[Audi]] and [[Volkswagen]] retired its 3-cylinder cars, the [[Audi A2#1.2 TDI|A2 1.2 TDI]] and the [[Volkswagen Lupo#Lupo 3L|Lupo 1.2 TDI]] respectively.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web|last=Abuelsamid |first=Sam |url=http://www.autobloggreen.com/2007/09/11/frankfurt-2007-smart-fortwo-micro-hybrid-launches/ |title=Frankfurt 2007: Smart Fortwo micro hybrid launched |publisher=AutoblogGreen |date=2007-09-11 |accessdate=2010-10-17}}</ref>\n* '''Crossblade''': a 2002 limited-edition variant of the city cabrio, a roadster without a windshield, roof or conventional doors.

After [[Robbie Williams]] purchased Crossblade number 008, Smart began a marketing association with him, using him to promote the brand and the new [[Forfour]].\n* '''[[Smart Crosstown|Crosstown]]''': a convertible with a foldable windshield based on the Fortwo, was presented at IAA Frankfurt in 2005. No plans have been announced to bring this model to market.\n* '''Nightrun''': includes instrument panels, steering wheel, paddles, shifter, Monoblock VI alloy wheels, leather seats and engine upgrade from Brabus.

It also featured wider wheels, revised front spoiler and grille, and a revised rear exhaust.\n* '''K''': launched in October 2001, exclusively for the [[Japan]]ese market. It was designed to fit the [[Japan]]ese [[kei car]] regulations by adopting specially developed rear fenders and narrowing the track width and tire dimensions and the width reduced to 1.47&nbsp;m. The engine displacement remains unchanged at 598 cc, as specified in the standard. Safety features include ESP ([[Electronic Stability Program]]) and BAS ([[Brake Assist System]]) as standard.

Smart claims the standard power soft top will open or close in 12 seconds, and can be operated at any speed. At market launch, 5 soft top colors were offered; black, red, grey, beige and brown. Grey, beige and brown tops were marketed as BRABUS tailor made soft tops.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2017-smart-fortwo-cabriolet-us-spec-first-drive-review |title=2017 Smart Fortwo Cabriolet U.S. Spec |accessdate=2016-09-30 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161128131001/http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2017-smart-fortwo-cabriolet-us-spec-first-drive-review |archivedate=2016-11-28 |date=2016-09-30 }}</ref>\n\nThe smart fortwo cabrio features removable roof bars that stow into an integrated storage space in the fortwo's rear tailgate.

Smart subsequently designed a floorpan for right-hand-drive models.  The Fortwo is now marketed in 37 countries worldwide.\n\n'''Australia''': The Smart Fortwo was marketed through select [[Mercedes-Benz]] dealers in [[Australia]] from 2003 to 2015 in only the middle 'Pulse' range, and with the petrol engine. In 2007, the base price for the Fortwo coup\u00e9 was [[Australian dollar|A$]]19,900, and the Fortwo cabriolet was $22,900.

It was offered with the \"micro-hybrid drive\"  natural aspirated engine (mhd) in standard configuration with a special edition named \"Brazilian Edition\" which was offered only in yellow (in reference to the Brazilian Flag) with a Brazilian flag sticker on both sides, and turbocharged versions named \"standard\" (no name), Tritop and Passion. The mhd were offered only in \"coup\u00e9\" configuration with no sunroof, and turbocharged versions were offered in both coup\u00e9 (with sunroof) and cabrio variants.\n\nA few units of the fortwo Brabus were also offered in Brazil in the year 2010.\n\nIn 2016, Mercedes-Benz decided to discontinue offer of the fortwo in Brazilian market, hence Brazilian customers never had the option of the 453.\n\nThere are also a few W450s in Brazil, although they weren't officially imported by Mercedes-Benz and have no official support.\n\n'''China''':\nIn April 2008, Smart premiered at the 2008 [[Beijing Auto Show]]. In October 2008, the Smart \"[[vending machine]]\" road show had the first stop in [[Shenyang]] and began the Fortwo's pre-order period.\n\n'''Japan''': The Fortwo is the only non-Japanese car ever to fulfil the regulations for [[Kei car]]s.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} There is a Japan-only variant of the first generation Smart Fortwo, called the Smart K.\n\n===Canada===\n{{refimprove section|date=April 2014}}\n[[File:2013 Smart Fortwo -- 2012 NYIAS.JPG|thumb|2013 Smart Fortwo]]\n\nThe smart fortwo was introduced in [[Canada]] in September 2004 and sold through Mercedes-Benz dealers. Only the turbo-diesel powerplant was offered for the 450 coup\u00e9 and 450 convertible models because the fuel vapour recovery system for the gasoline-powered car would have had to be redesigned to meet Transport Canada standards.  Diesels do not require such a system because the fuel is not volatile, so the cdi was certified instead.  Demand was initially heavy, with up to six-month waiting lists in major urban areas in the spring of 2005. 10,242 cdi cars were imported in model years 2005 and 2006.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gregwilliams.ca/?tag%3Dsmart-car-history |title=Greg Williams \u2013 Motor Writer \u2014 Automobiles, Trucks, Motorcycles old and new |accessdate=2015-04-07 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304094615/http://www.gregwilliams.ca/?tag=smart-car-history |archivedate=2016-03-04 }}</ref>  Two or three of these were used in Transport Canada crash testing.\n\nCanada received three special versions of the 450 cdi: the grandstyle\u2014only available in dark green with silver, and beige leather\u2014of which 200 were imported in coup\u00e9 and cabriolet forms, the BRABUS nightrun\u2014equipped with BRABUS accessories at the Hambach factory, which only came as a black on black (with blue-grey leather) coup\u00e9, and 50 of those were delivered, and finally the BRABUS Tailor Made Canada 1 models, of which only four were produced, three red on red and one white on white, all with highest equipment levels and all BRABUS accessories, high-quality dyed-through leather and Alcantara interiors.  The white car is a cabriolet, as are two of the red ones.  The sole Canada 1 coup\u00e9 has a fixed glass roof.\n\nIn 2008, Canada received only the gasoline 451 model because the diesel version did not meet 2007 Canadian emission standards. The 451 fortwo carries a 1.0-litre engine that delivers up to {{convert|70|hp}} and a re-engineered automated-manual 5-speed transmission with a slightly larger body.  This engine has been the sole powertrain for Canada since the 451 was introduced\u2014even the BRABUS models only have 70 HP. The 451 has sold very well in Canada: over 12,600 were registered between the start of 2008 and the end of 2012.  The lack of a diesel option has hindered 451 sales to some owners of the diesel 450s.\n\nCanada received several special versions of the 451 as well: the limited 1, the limited 3, the highstyle, the greystyle, the edit10n BRABUS Tailor Made (ten coup\u00e9s), one all orange \"Ultimate\" BRABUS Tailor Made, the sharpred, among others.\n\nSmart Canada released ten 10th anniversary edition smart Fortwo cars in February 2009. Each car started life as a Canadian BRABUS model before being converted into 10th anniversary editions by BRABUS in Germany.  All examples feature arctic grey metallic paint with brown and alcantara leather interiors and black BRABUS Monoblock 7 wheels. The cars carry a number plate on the dash to signify its production number out of ten.\n\nSmart Canada also commissioned Busch Automodelle GmbH to produce 1:87 scale versions (with a black tridion), of which 10,000 were made.\n\n===United States===\n[[File:Smart-ForTwo.jpg|thumb|right|G & K Auto Conversion Model in the US]]\n\nIn June 2002, a Smart Fortwo was exhibited in the U.S. at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA) affiliate [[MoMA PS1|P.S. 1]] in [[Queens]], [[New York City|New York]].\n\nIn January 2005, DaimlerChrysler showed the Smart brand at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan.

The first generation used a six-speed version, and the second generation uses a five-speed version, model 5AMT130. Input from floor-mounted shifter or optional steering-wheel-mounted paddles controls a servo-operated clutch and sequential automated gearbox. The vehicle may be driven in automatic mode (early models had the option of full automatic mode, or standard \"soft-tip\" which was manual mode indicated by no button on the gearshift) or in semi-automatic (half automatic) mode via paddle shifters, where the operator controls the shift points but cannot feather or adjust the speed of the clutch.\n\nFrom 2009, revised transmission software enabled smoother and faster gear changes. The software, available via an ECU upgrade, was also made available for 2008 second generation cars, with a new battery as required.<ref>{{cite web|last='qwcdirect' |title=SMART FOURTWO |url=http://www.houndgear.org/category/smart/ |accessdate=10 September 2010 |date=13 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228054019/http://www.houndgear.org/category/smart/ |archivedate=December 28, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last='tampasmart'|title=Do you need smart 2.0 upgrade?|url=http://www.smartcarofamerica.com/forums/f25/do-you-need-smart-2-0-upgrade-21725/|work= Smart Car of America Forums|accessdate=10 September 2010|date=4 November 2009}}</ref>\n\nThird generation models receive a five-speed manual transmission or dual clutch automated manual transmission.\n\n===Parking===\nWith an overall length (first generation: 2.5&nbsp;m (98.4&nbsp;in)) approximately equal to the width of regular parking space, a smart Fortwo can park perpendicularly in spaces typically designed for [[parallel parking]], allowing two Smarts to park in one space\u2014a manner of parking not permissible in many jurisdictions worldwide (e.g. Austria, New Zealand and California<ref>{{cite web|title=Section 22502 \u2013 Curb Parking|url=http://dmv.ca.gov/pubs/vctop/d11/vc22502.htm|work=California Vehicle Code|publisher=California DMV|accessdate=16 August 2011}}</ref>).\n\n=={{anchor|1|W450}}First generation (Build series W450, 1998\u20132007)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image = Smart Fortwo passion front.JPG\n| production = 1998\u20132007\n| name = First generation (W450)\n| aka = Smart City Coup\u00e9 (1998\u20132002)<br />Smart Fortwo (facelift)\n| body_style = 3-door [[hatchback]]\n| front_suspension =\n| rear_suspension =\n| wheelbase = {{convert|71.3|in|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| length = {{convert|98.4|in|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| width = {{convert|59.6|in|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| height = {{convert|61|in|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| weight = {{convert|1610|lb|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| engine = {{ubl\n  |0.6\u20130.7 L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M160 engine|M160]]'' [[Straight-three engine|I3]] [[turbocharger|turbo]] (petrol)\n  |0.8 L ''[[Mercedes-Benz OM660 engine|OM660]]'' [[Straight-three engine|I3]] [[turbocharger|turbo]] (diesel)\n  }}\n| transmission = 6-speed [[Semi-automatic transmission|automated manual]]\n| sp = uk\n}}\n\nThe first generation, build series W450, debuted in 1998 and received a [[facelift (automotive)|facelift]] in 2002.\n\n===Engine===\nThe engines are [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] with [[straight-3|three cylinders]].

Trim levels include the Pure, Pulse, and Passion. Pure models are fitted with the standard audio system but nothing else; Pulse models are fitted with alloy wheels, panoramic glass roof and paddle-shifters on the steering wheel (2004+); and finally, the Passion models are fitted with air-conditioning and ability to select between fully automatic and sequential gearbox.\n* '''Limited 1''': The first limited edition of which 7500 were made, all left-hand drive. It was released at the original launch in 1998. It had a black Tridion cell and white body panels. It also had alloy wheels, a Limited 1 insignia, and a blue interior with beige leather finishings. It was supplied with a certificate showing which number out of the 7500, and a plaque with this number below the windshield on the inside.\n* '''SE''': This was the second limited edition that smart made; it was sold in mid 2001 (Mk5) and all were left hand drive. They were all Pulse specification with a redesigned steering wheel, soft touch, air conditioning, CD Multichanger and drinks holder as standard. The engine power was upped to 61BHP from the standard 55BHP normally applied to the Pulse in the 600cc G1 cars. It was designated by a SE badge on the boot and was sold in Bay Grey with grey interior and dark blue twist fabric.\n* '''Cdi''': has the world's smallest production [[common rail|common-rail direct injection]] [[diesel engine]]. With a consumption of 3.3 litres ([[New European Driving Cycle|NEDC]]) per 100 kilometres (71.2 mpg) and [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] emissions of just 88&nbsp;grams per kilometre, it has the lowest current production car CO<sub>2</sub> emissions worldwide, since [[Audi]] and [[Volkswagen]] retired its 3-cylinder cars, the [[Audi A2#1.2 TDI|A2 1.2 TDI]] and the [[Volkswagen Lupo#Lupo 3L|Lupo 1.2 TDI]] respectively.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web|last=Abuelsamid |first=Sam |url=http://www.autobloggreen.com/2007/09/11/frankfurt-2007-smart-fortwo-micro-hybrid-launches/ |title=Frankfurt 2007: Smart Fortwo micro hybrid launched |publisher=AutoblogGreen |date=2007-09-11 |accessdate=2010-10-17}}</ref>\n* '''Crossblade''': a 2002 limited-edition variant of the city cabrio, a roadster without a windshield, roof or conventional doors.

No plans have been announced to bring this model to market.\n* '''Nightrun''': includes instrument panels, steering wheel, paddles, shifter, Monoblock VI alloy wheels, leather seats and engine upgrade from Brabus. Edition Nightrun is only available with the Fortwo coup\u00e9/cabrio.\n* '''Truestyle''': painted in metallic ruby red, available in pure trim.\n* '''i-move''': a special edition run of 70 Fortwo cabrios, based on the Passion cabrio specs with [[Brabus]] Monobloc VI wheels, leather interior trim, Lite White panels, an iPod cradle with special edition 20Gb 3G iPod, and an aluminium name plate on the dash confirmed its special edition status.\n* '''Forfun2 Concept''': an off-road version of the Fortwo introduced at the 2005 Athens Motor Show by Greek 4x4 Rally Champion Stefan Attart.

It also featured wider wheels, revised front spoiler and grille, and a revised rear exhaust.\n* '''K''': launched in October 2001, exclusively for the [[Japan]]ese market. It was designed to fit the [[Japan]]ese [[kei car]] regulations by adopting specially developed rear fenders and narrowing the track width and tire dimensions and the width reduced to 1.47&nbsp;m.

Smart subsequently designed a floorpan for right-hand-drive models.  The Fortwo is now marketed in 37 countries worldwide.\n\n'''Australia''': The Smart Fortwo was marketed through select [[Mercedes-Benz]] dealers in [[Australia]] from 2003 to 2015 in only the middle 'Pulse' range, and with the petrol engine. In 2007, the base price for the Fortwo coup\u00e9 was [[Australian dollar|A$]]19,900, and the Fortwo cabriolet was $22,900.

It was offered with the \"micro-hybrid drive\"  natural aspirated engine (mhd) in standard configuration with a special edition named \"Brazilian Edition\" which was offered only in yellow (in reference to the Brazilian Flag) with a Brazilian flag sticker on both sides, and turbocharged versions named \"standard\" (no name), Tritop and Passion. The mhd were offered only in \"coup\u00e9\" configuration with no sunroof, and turbocharged versions were offered in both coup\u00e9 (with sunroof) and cabrio variants.\n\nA few units of the fortwo Brabus were also offered in Brazil in the year 2010.\n\nIn 2016, Mercedes-Benz decided to discontinue offer of the fortwo in Brazilian market, hence Brazilian customers never had the option of the 453.\n\nThere are also a few W450s in Brazil, although they weren't officially imported by Mercedes-Benz and have no official support.\n\n'''China''':\nIn April 2008, Smart premiered at the 2008 [[Beijing Auto Show]]. In October 2008, the Smart \"[[vending machine]]\" road show had the first stop in [[Shenyang]] and began the Fortwo's pre-order period.\n\n'''Japan''': The Fortwo is the only non-Japanese car ever to fulfil the regulations for [[Kei car]]s.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} There is a Japan-only variant of the first generation Smart Fortwo, called the Smart K.\n\n===Canada===\n{{refimprove section|date=April 2014}}\n[[File:2013 Smart Fortwo -- 2012 NYIAS.JPG|thumb|2013 Smart Fortwo]]\n\nThe smart fortwo was introduced in [[Canada]] in September 2004 and sold through Mercedes-Benz dealers. Only the turbo-diesel powerplant was offered for the 450 coup\u00e9 and 450 convertible models because the fuel vapour recovery system for the gasoline-powered car would have had to be redesigned to meet Transport Canada standards.  Diesels do not require such a system because the fuel is not volatile, so the cdi was certified instead.  Demand was initially heavy, with up to six-month waiting lists in major urban areas in the spring of 2005. 10,242 cdi cars were imported in model years 2005 and 2006.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gregwilliams.ca/?tag%3Dsmart-car-history |title=Greg Williams \u2013 Motor Writer \u2014 Automobiles, Trucks, Motorcycles old and new |accessdate=2015-04-07 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304094615/http://www.gregwilliams.ca/?tag=smart-car-history |archivedate=2016-03-04 }}</ref>  Two or three of these were used in Transport Canada crash testing.\n\nCanada received three special versions of the 450 cdi: the grandstyle\u2014only available in dark green with silver, and beige leather\u2014of which 200 were imported in coup\u00e9 and cabriolet forms, the BRABUS nightrun\u2014equipped with BRABUS accessories at the Hambach factory, which only came as a black on black (with blue-grey leather) coup\u00e9, and 50 of those were delivered, and finally the BRABUS Tailor Made Canada 1 models, of which only four were produced, three red on red and one white on white, all with highest equipment levels and all BRABUS accessories, high-quality dyed-through leather and Alcantara interiors.  The white car is a cabriolet, as are two of the red ones.  The sole Canada 1 coup\u00e9 has a fixed glass roof.\n\nIn 2008, Canada received only the gasoline 451 model because the diesel version did not meet 2007 Canadian emission standards. The 451 fortwo carries a 1.0-litre engine that delivers up to {{convert|70|hp}} and a re-engineered automated-manual 5-speed transmission with a slightly larger body.  This engine has been the sole powertrain for Canada since the 451 was introduced\u2014even the BRABUS models only have 70 HP. The 451 has sold very well in Canada: over 12,600 were registered between the start of 2008 and the end of 2012.  The lack of a diesel option has hindered 451 sales to some owners of the diesel 450s.\n\nCanada received several special versions of the 451 as well: the limited 1, the limited 3, the highstyle, the greystyle, the edit10n BRABUS Tailor Made (ten coup\u00e9s), one all orange \"Ultimate\" BRABUS Tailor Made, the sharpred, among others.\n\nSmart Canada released ten 10th anniversary edition smart Fortwo cars in February 2009. Each car started life as a Canadian BRABUS model before being converted into 10th anniversary editions by BRABUS in Germany.  All examples feature arctic grey metallic paint with brown and alcantara leather interiors and black BRABUS Monoblock 7 wheels. The cars carry a number plate on the dash to signify its production number out of ten.\n\nSmart Canada also commissioned Busch Automodelle GmbH to produce 1:87 scale versions (with a black tridion), of which 10,000 were made.\n\n===United States===\n[[File:Smart-ForTwo.jpg|thumb|right|G & K Auto Conversion Model in the US]]\n\nIn June 2002, a Smart Fortwo was exhibited in the U.S. at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA) affiliate [[MoMA PS1|P.S. 1]] in [[Queens]], [[New York City|New York]].\n\nIn January 2005, DaimlerChrysler showed the Smart brand at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan.

Initially, it was an [[Nazi ghettos#Types of ghettos|open ghetto]]; many Jews worked on labor projects for various local firms, especially the railway and the [[Luftwaffe]]. Beginning in May 1941, the ghetto became a collection center with Jews sent there from the [[Opole Ghetto|Opole]] and [[Warsaw Ghetto|Warsaw]] ghettos. In 1942, two thousand Jews [[deportation of Jews from Slovakia|arrived from Slovakia]] and hundreds more from nearby ghettos that had been liquidated.{{efn|name=liquidation|Liquidation refers to the Nazi action of shutting down a ghetto, with the inhabitants forced to move, deported, or murdered nearby.{{sfn|Aronson|Longerich|2001|p=194}}}}\n\nThe first deportation was in May 1942 and took around 2,500 Jews to [[Sobib\u00f3r extermination camp]]. In October that same year, the ghetto was liquidated; about 2,500 Jews were deported to [[Treblinka extermination camp]] while some 1,400 Jews were retained as inmates of forced-labor camps in the town. Unusually, the labor camp operated by the Luftwaffe\u2014employing, at its peak, about a thousand Jews\u2014was allowed to exist until 22 July 1944.

The motive was probably to keep Jews away from the two nearby military installations, a Luftwaffe airfield and a Wehrmacht base, which were filled with troops in preparation for the [[Operation Barbarossa|1941 invasion of the Soviet Union]]. (The decree establishing the ghetto was not formally issued until 1942).{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=637}} Until 1942,{{sfn|Yad Vashem|2009|p=156}} Irena was an [[Nazi ghettos#Types of ghettos|open ghetto]] (there was no physical fence, although the penalty for unauthorized departure was death) consisting of six streets. Its boundaries were initially Ok\u00f3lna Street, the Irenka River, Bankowa, and Staromiejska Streets. Staromiejska Street was removed from the ghetto in September 1942; its residents moved to Bankowa. Initially, Poles were allowed to enter and perhaps live in the ghetto, so many of the Jews were able to survive by trading material goods for food with them.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=637}} A Polish-language secular school, run by Aida Milgroijm-Citronbojm, instructed 70 to 100 pupils.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=637}}{{sfn|Rubin|2006|p=92}}\n\nIn late 1941, Poles were banned from entering the ghetto, resulting in waste piling up and [[typhus]] and [[dysentery]] epidemics. The sick were treated at a thirty-bed hospital run by Isaar Kawa, a doctor from [[Konin]]; with the help of Polish doctors, medicines were imported from Warsaw.{{sfn|Yad Vashem|2009|p=157}}{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=637}}  Simultaneously,  new restrictions were imposed by the Germans: the use of stoves was banned, winter clothing requisitioned, and fuel imports forbidden.{{sfn|Rubin|2006|p=92}}{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=637}} More Jews began to leave the ghetto to obtain essentials, resulting in twenty young women being shot after being captured.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=638}} Because conditions were better in Lublin District than in Warsaw, some Jews fled to towns there including D\u0119blin\u2013Irena;{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=196}} twenty Jews were shot for being unregistered refugees. The {{lang|de|Judenrat}}{{'}}s command altered again as Drayfish was executed, accused of filing complaints with the Pu\u0142awy County administration; he was replaced by the businessman Yisrael Weinberg.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=638}}\n\nIn March 1941, 3,750 Jews lived in the ghetto, including 565 who were not from the area. These consisted mainly of Jews expelled from [[Pu\u0142awy]] and the [[Warthegau]] region, as well as some Jews who had come to live with relatives to avoid being trapped in the [[Warsaw Ghetto]]. Overcrowding was severe; there were 7\u201315 people per room. More Jews arrived in May 1941: 1,000 from the ghettos at Warsaw, [[Cz\u0119stochowa Ghetto|Cz\u0119stochowa]], and [[Opole Ghetto|Opole]], although they were not housed in the ghetto but at work sites in the area.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=637}} On 13 and 14&nbsp;May 1942, two transports totalling 2,042 [[Slovak Jews]]  [[List of Holocaust transports from Slovakia|arrived from Pre\u0161ov]].{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=638}}{{sfn|B\u00fcchler |1991| p=166}} Although they brought food with them, they were unused to the harsh conditions and many died of typhus due to the poor sanitation.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=638}}{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=62}} More than 2,000 Jews were brought to D\u0119blin\u2013Irena from nearby towns, having survived the liquidation{{efn|name=liquidation}} of their communities because they had been selected to work.

They also built a barbed-wire-enclosed complex adjacent to the runway for craftsmen to work.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=64}} Following the completion of the project in October, the workers were dispersed to various projects around the town, an action which may have been related to the typhus epidemic.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=637}}{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=64}} Some of the Jews from Vienna stayed at the airfield, having obtained permits to work on gravel transportation and building fuel tanks; they were the nucleus for the later labor camp. After the deportation of 6&nbsp;May 1942, additional Jews tried to secure permits, often fictitious ones obtained through bribery, to avoid deportation. By October 1942, the camp had 543 legal residents.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=64}} At this point there were five forced-labor camps around D\u0119blin: the Luftwaffe camp, the fortress, the train station (300 Jews), Lipova Street (200 Jews and Poles), and another near the municipal boundary (300 Jews).{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=400}}\n\n== Deportation, murder, and liquidation ==\n===First deportation (6 May 1942)===\nThe first deportation was on 6&nbsp;May 1942,{{sfn|Weinstein|2006|p=459}}{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=638}} to clear space for the Slovak deportees who arrived a week later.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=608}}{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=638}}{{sfn|Musia\u0142|2000|p=244}} A force composed of German and Ukrainian police and a few German SS and Ukrainian SS auxiliaries ordered Jews to assemble in the main square at 09:00&nbsp;hours.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=638}} According to [[Yad Vashem]], the [[Blue Police]] also participated.{{sfn|Yad Vashem|2009|p=158}} Probably because the Luftwaffe was seeking permission to recruit more laborers, the Jews had to wait for five hours.

Under the command of {{lang|de|SS-Obersturmf\u00fchrer}} Grossman; gendarmes, Luftwaffe soldiers, and police auxiliaries rounded up the remaining Jewish population.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=638}} Many Jews tried to enter the Luftwaffe camp, which at that time had 543 official residents, but they were turned away by the Jewish police there. Talia Farkash estimates that about 500, including 60\u201390 young children, managed to get in, mostly by paying bribes.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=638}}{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=66}} Silberklang's estimate is that 1,000 Jews entered the camp, including 280 women and 100 children.{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=400}} The Jewish elder, Hermann Wenkert, later claimed that if he had allowed non-registered Jews entry, and they were discovered, everyone in the camp would have been killed. Instead, he bribed the Germans to obtain legal permits for an additional 400 Jews, which were mostly given to the wives and children of current residents.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=66}}\n\nMany of the Slovak Jews, not knowing what to expect, had lingered in the ghetto while packing their bags.

Either on that day or within the next few weeks, 1,000 people were removed from the labor camps, including the 200 workers at D\u0119blin Fortress and 200\u2013500 of the Luftwaffe's workers.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=638}}{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=63}} They were deported to Ko\u0144skowola{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=63}} or Treblinka.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=638}}\n\nAfter this, Farkash estimates that there were about 1,400 Jews were still alive in the labor camps around Irena.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=63}} Estimates of the number at the Luftwaffe camp range frmo 1,000 (''[[Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos]]''){{sfn|Crago|2012|p=638}} to 2,000 (Silberklang),{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=400}} with another 300 at a railway camp near the passenger station, and 120 at another camp near the railway loading station.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=63}} During May or July 1943, most of the remaining prisoners in the railway camps were deported to [[Poniatowa concentration camp|Poniatowa]] via the transit ghetto in Ko\u0144skowola; the rest were deported in late 1943.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=638}}{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=63}}  In the remaining labor camps in Pu\u0142awy County, where hundreds of Jews were still alive, they were murdered during [[Operation Harvest Festival]] (2\u20133&nbsp;November 1943). This operation also killed the prisoners of Poniatowa but did not affect the Jews at the Luftwaffe camp in D\u0119blin\u2013Irena,{{sfn|Farkash|2014|pp=60\u201361, 63}}{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=402}} who were unaware of it.{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=409}} Following Operation Harvest Festival, there were ten labor camps for Jews in the Lublin District with more than 10,000 Jews still alive.{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=365}}\n\n== Luftwaffe camp ==\n===Camp leader===\n[[File:UT 2 w Szkole Orlat w Deblinie.jpg|thumb|alt= Polish Air Force Academy airfield with four planes and a number of men around them |[[Polish Air Force Academy]] in D\u0119blin, 1947]]\nThe camp leader ({{lang-de|[[Lager\u00e4lteste]]}}) at the Luftwaffe camp was Hermann Wenkert, a Jewish lawyer from Vienna who had been deported to Opole in 1941 and came to Irena with the volunteers.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=65}}  According to Wenkert's account,{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=402}} soon after his arrival he happened upon Eduard Bromofsky, an Austrian Luftwaffe officer with whom Wenkert had served during World War I. Bromofsky convinced the commander of the camp to promote Wenkert to his position. Even after Bromofsky was reassigned, the relationships that Wenkert had cultivated with the German authorities enabled him to retain his position.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=65}} Wenkert populated the administration with other Viennese Jews, insisted on extra rations for himself and his family, and had his family transferred from Opole to Irena. Because of his close association with the German authorities and use of his position for personal benefit, some survivors considered him to be a collaborator.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=65}}{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=401}} When it was possible, Wenkert negotiated with the authorities and paid bribes to avoid punishment; he also consulted respected prisoners in cases where the matter had not come to German attention. However, when he thought there was no other option and the survival of the camp was in the balance, Wenkert turned Jews accused of wrongdoing over to the Germans even though he knew that this would result in their deaths.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=67}} In general, German-speaking Jews had a more positive impression of him than the local Jews, who spoke Yiddish.{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=66}} According to Silberklang, both views of Wenkert may be true: that he tried to secure benefits for himself personally while also working to keep the other Jewish prisoners alive.{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|pp=401\u2013402}}\n\n===Conditions===\nConditions were relatively good compared to other camps.{{sfn|Rubin|2006|p=93}}{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=365}} Residents received food rations of about 1,700 [[kilocalories]] daily (enough to live), weekly baths, medical care, and were allowed to practice their religion.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=78}}{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=400}} The presence of 100 young children\u2014whose existence was justified by increasing the productivity of their parents\u2014was particularly unusual and not equalled elsewhere in the Lublin District after Operation Harvest Festival. The children received education in Polish, but had to hide when the SS conducted inspections.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|pp=72\u201373}} According to Israeli historian Talia Farkash, Wenkert's positive relationship with the camp command was partially responsible for the good conditions.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=69}} Wenkert managed to get religious Jews exempted from working on [[Shabbat]] and allowed a [[chevra kadisha]] society to operate, burying the dead according to Jewish law. In 1943, about 80 Jews (including Wenkert) received kosher food for the week of [[Passover]].{{sfn|Farkash|2014|pp=73\u201374}}{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=401}}\n\nThe camp had three German commanders, all at the rank of Sergeant Major:  Kattengel (through March 1943), Dusy, and Rademacher (during the last two months). Although Kattengel was distrusted, because he roamed the camp with a dog and whip, both Dusy and Rademacher were described positively by survivors. Dusy even arranged for one woman to receive treatment at a German hospital after she was badly injured. Wiszniewski, a local {{lang|de|Volkesdeutscher}}, was the lead foreman of the Jewish laborers and did not mistreat them. Autheried engineer Kozak brought food to the Jews he worked with.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|pp=69\u201370}} Both theft and having foreign currency were punishable by death. Punishment could be excessive and arbitrary\u2014nine Jews were shot for causing a fire, even though it was proved to be accidental\u2014but less so than other Nazi camps.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|pp=74\u201375}} According to Farkash, in 1943, Wenkert allowed a group of [[Jewish partisans]] seeking refuge from a hostile unit of the Polish [[Home Army]] resistance group into the camp.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=67}} The Slovak Jews at the camp were the last major group to survive of the almost 40,000 Slovak Jews deported to the Lublin District in 1942.{{sfn|B\u00fcchler |1991| p=159}}{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=296}} The [[The Holocaust in Slovakia#Hiatus (1943)|Jews remaining in Pre\u0161ov]] hired couriers (non-Jews from the Polish\u2013Slovak border) to travel to the camp regularly until it was dissolved, carrying letters and bringing valuables and money. A committee was formed in the camp to distribute the aid among the Slovak Jews. Cases of theft by Polish Jews led to friction between the two communities.{{sfn|B\u00fcchler |1991|p=159}}{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=70}}\n\nDespite the relatively good conditions, some Jews tried to escape because they feared that the camp would be liquidated. The Luftwaffe camp command imposed [[collective punishment]] to deter escapees.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=74}} According to a 1943 [[Home Army]] report, the local Polish population was hostile to Jewish fugitives. The organization itself accused Jews of joining Communist partisan groups and stealing from Polish peasants.{{sfn|Zimmerman|2015|pp=213, 361}} Most Jews who tried to escape were captured, and others returned to the camp.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=74}} Several members of the Kowalczyk family were honored as [[Righteous Among the Nations]] for sheltering Jews who had escaped from the camp.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kowalczyk family |url=https://righteous.yadvashem.org/?search=Deblin&searchType=righteous_only&language=en&itemId=4034962&ind=1 |website=The Righteous Among the Nations Database |publisher=[[Yad Vashem]]|accessdate=1 January 2020}}</ref> \u00c1rp\u00e1d Szab\u00f3, a Hungarian military doctor, was similarly recognized for smuggling a Slovak Jewish couple to Hungary.<ref>{{cite web |title=Szab\u00f3 \u00c1rp\u00e1d |url=https://righteous.yadvashem.org/?search=Deblin&searchType=righteous_only&language=en&itemId=4044388&ind=2 |website=The Righteous Among the Nations Database |publisher=[[Yad Vashem]] |accessdate=1 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Liquidation===\n[[File:Cz\u0119stochowa - Hasag-Pelcery plaque 2.jpg|thumb|alt=Plaque with Star of David and Hebrew letters|left|Memorial plaque at the former HASAG camp in Cz\u0119stochowa]]\nThe camp was liquidated on 22&nbsp;July 1944, the same day that the Red Army reached Lublin.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=638}} At the time of the deportation, some 800 to 900 Jews were still alive, of whom 400 to 600 were from  D\u0119blin\u2013Irena,{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=638}} 40 from Vienna,{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=70}} and 70 to 80  from Slovakia.{{sfn|B\u00fcchler |1991|p=159}} Two{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=75}} or three{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=409}} transports departed from D\u0119blin\u2013Irena on 17 and 22&nbsp;July.  (Silberklang reports a third on 20 July).{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=409}} Since no one was willing to volunteer, the first transport carried about 200 people who had few connections in the camp, including single adults and fifteen children between three and six years of age. On the orders of camp security officer Georg Bartenschlager, the fifteen children were shot upon their arrival in Cz\u0119stochowa. The rest of the prisoners, including Wenkert and 33 young children, departed on the second transport with Rademacher, the German camp commander, who carried a letter of protection from the airfield commander.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=75}} About fifty Jews escaped from the camp during the evacuation, but most were killed. The second transport arrived in Cz\u0119stochowa on 25 July; the young children were kept separated for two and a half days but were not killed. The reason for this is not clear, but likely involved negotiations with Bartenschlager.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|pp=76\u201377}} In Cz\u0119stochowa, the Jews worked at the four  [[Hugo Schneider AG]] plants. Some were deported to [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]] and [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]] in January 1945 while others were liberated by the Red Army.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=77}} About half survived.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=638}}\n\nAccording to Farkash, the airfield camp at D\u0119blin\u2013Irena is a \"singular case\" in the Lublin district and possibly in the entirety of occupied Poland.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=58}} One unusual aspect of the camp was that it was run from start to finish by the Luftwaffe rather than the SS, although during 1943 and 1944, the SS tried to expand its role.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=68}} According to Silberklang, being run by the Wehrmacht helped to ensure the camp's survival.{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=364}} However, other camps (such as three in Zamo\u015b\u0107 county) were run by the Luftwaffe and yet were still liquidated before the end of 1943.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|pp=68, 78}} Another reason was the importance of Jewish workers at D\u0119blin to the German war effort,{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=411}}{{sfn|Farkash|2014|pp=78\u201379}} which was continually emphasized by Wenkert in his dealings with the Germans. Overall, luck played a major role in the fortuitous combination of Jewish leadership, relatively friendly Germans, and the evacuation of the camp to Cz\u0119stochowa rather than [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]].{{sfn|Farkash|2014|pp=78\u201379}} Ninety-nine percent of the Jews from Lublin District were killed in the Holocaust,{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=431}} but hundreds from D\u0119blin\u2013Irena survived the war.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|pp=78\u201379}}\n\n== Aftermath ==\nD\u0119blin was liberated by the [[1st Polish Army]] by 27&nbsp;July 1944.{{sfn|Weinstein|2006|p=536}} Some of the Jewish survivors, who attempted to return home in January 1945, were told by the local [[Milicja Obywatelska]] chief that it was illegal for them to settle in town.{{sfn|Rubin|2004|p=88}}{{sfn|Rice|2017|p=[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=L0MwDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=D%C4%99blin+1942+jews&ots=4YMln6eUay&sig=R5NCwbZQA85AeAzLL2NuAiYSdwA&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=D%C4%99blin&f=false 29]}}{{sfn|Ko\u017ami\u0144ska-Frejlak|2014|p=154}} In March 1945, survivors \u0141aja, Gitla and Fryda Luksemburg were murdered with the involvement of local police.{{sfn|Krzy\u017canowski|2013|p=253}}<ref name=\"Miasto\" /> Ester Kaminska suffered repeated harassment and extortion from local Poles, one of whom had obtained her family's bakery from the Nazis, which led to her departure to Palestine in 1947.{{sfn|Rice|2017|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=L0MwDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=D%C4%99blin+1942+jews&ots=4YMln6eUay&sig=R5NCwbZQA85AeAzLL2NuAiYSdwA&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=D%C4%99blin&f=false 119\u2013120]}} Other Jews received threatening letters.

Initially, it was an [[Nazi ghettos#Types of ghettos|open ghetto]]; many Jews worked on labor projects for various local firms, especially the railway and the [[Luftwaffe]]. Beginning in May 1941, the ghetto became a collection center with Jews sent there from the [[Opole Ghetto|Opole]] and [[Warsaw Ghetto|Warsaw]] ghettos. In 1942, two thousand Jews [[deportation of Jews from Slovakia|arrived from Slovakia]] and hundreds more from nearby ghettos that had been liquidated.{{efn|name=liquidation|Liquidation refers to the Nazi action of shutting down a ghetto, with the inhabitants forced to move, deported, or murdered nearby.{{sfn|Aronson|Longerich|2001|p=194}}}}\n\nThe first deportation was in May 1942 and took around 2,500 Jews to [[Sobib\u00f3r extermination camp]]. In October that same year, the ghetto was liquidated; about 2,500 Jews were deported to [[Treblinka extermination camp]] while some 1,400 Jews were retained as inmates of forced-labor camps in the town. Unusually, the labor camp operated by the Luftwaffe\u2014employing, at its peak, about a thousand Jews\u2014was allowed to exist until 22 July 1944.

The motive was probably to keep Jews away from the two nearby military installations, a Luftwaffe airfield and a Wehrmacht base, which were filled with troops in preparation for the [[Operation Barbarossa|1941 invasion of the Soviet Union]]. (The decree establishing the ghetto was not formally issued until 1942).{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=637}} Until 1942,{{sfn|Yad Vashem|2009|p=156}} Irena was an [[Nazi ghettos#Types of ghettos|open ghetto]] (there was no physical fence, although the penalty for unauthorized departure was death) consisting of six streets. Its boundaries were initially Ok\u00f3lna Street, the Irenka River, Bankowa, and Staromiejska Streets. Staromiejska Street was removed from the ghetto in September 1942; its residents moved to Bankowa. Initially, Poles were allowed to enter and perhaps live in the ghetto, so many of the Jews were able to survive by trading material goods for food with them.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=637}} A Polish-language secular school, run by Aida Milgroijm-Citronbojm, instructed 70 to 100 pupils.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=637}}{{sfn|Rubin|2006|p=92}}\n\nIn late 1941, Poles were banned from entering the ghetto, resulting in waste piling up and [[typhus]] and [[dysentery]] epidemics.

Bromofsky convinced the commander of the camp to promote Wenkert to his position. Even after Bromofsky was reassigned, the relationships that Wenkert had cultivated with the German authorities enabled him to retain his position.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=65}} Wenkert populated the administration with other Viennese Jews, insisted on extra rations for himself and his family, and had his family transferred from Opole to Irena. Because of his close association with the German authorities and use of his position for personal benefit, some survivors considered him to be a collaborator.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=65}}{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=401}} When it was possible, Wenkert negotiated with the authorities and paid bribes to avoid punishment; he also consulted respected prisoners in cases where the matter had not come to German attention. However, when he thought there was no other option and the survival of the camp was in the balance, Wenkert turned Jews accused of wrongdoing over to the Germans even though he knew that this would result in their deaths.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=67}} In general, German-speaking Jews had a more positive impression of him than the local Jews, who spoke Yiddish.{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=66}} According to Silberklang, both views of Wenkert may be true: that he tried to secure benefits for himself personally while also working to keep the other Jewish prisoners alive.{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|pp=401\u2013402}}\n\n===Conditions===\nConditions were relatively good compared to other camps.{{sfn|Rubin|2006|p=93}}{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=365}} Residents received food rations of about 1,700 [[kilocalories]] daily (enough to live), weekly baths, medical care, and were allowed to practice their religion.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=78}}{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=400}} The presence of 100 young children\u2014whose existence was justified by increasing the productivity of their parents\u2014was particularly unusual and not equalled elsewhere in the Lublin District after Operation Harvest Festival. The children received education in Polish, but had to hide when the SS conducted inspections.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|pp=72\u201373}} According to Israeli historian Talia Farkash, Wenkert's positive relationship with the camp command was partially responsible for the good conditions.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=69}} Wenkert managed to get religious Jews exempted from working on [[Shabbat]] and allowed a [[chevra kadisha]] society to operate, burying the dead according to Jewish law. In 1943, about 80 Jews (including Wenkert) received kosher food for the week of [[Passover]].{{sfn|Farkash|2014|pp=73\u201374}}{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=401}}\n\nThe camp had three German commanders, all at the rank of Sergeant Major:  Kattengel (through March 1943), Dusy, and Rademacher (during the last two months). Although Kattengel was distrusted, because he roamed the camp with a dog and whip, both Dusy and Rademacher were described positively by survivors. Dusy even arranged for one woman to receive treatment at a German hospital after she was badly injured. Wiszniewski, a local {{lang|de|Volkesdeutscher}}, was the lead foreman of the Jewish laborers and did not mistreat them.

The Vijayanagar rulers installed viceroys to rule over various parts of the empire. In 1532 CE, [[Achyuta Deva Raya]], the brother and successor of [[Krishnadevaraya|Krishna Deva Raya]] of Vijayanagar granted Sevappa Nayak, the governor of Thanjavur, permission to establish a feudatory kingdom following his Southern Campaigns against the last Chola ruler.\n{{TNhistory}}\n\n==Literature==\n{{Expand section|date=December 2019}}\n[[Telugu literature]] flourished during the reign of Nayakas in [[Tanjavur]] which was referred to as Southern School of Telugu Literature.<ref name=tel1>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=ZOlNv8MAXIEC&pg=PA269&dq=literature+tajavur+nayaks+telugu&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjhsbHr683mAhU7wjgGHTe3DGUQ6AEIVjAF#v=onepage&q=literature%20tajavur%20nayaks%20telugu&f=false|title=The Garland Encyclopedia of World Music: South Asia : the Indian subcontinent|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=1998|language=en}}</ref> Many Telugu Musicians and Pandits were part of their court.<ref name=tel1 />\n\n==Nayak kings==\n\n===Chevvappa Nayak===\n{{HistoryOfSouthAsia}}\n[[Chevvappa Nayak]] a.k.a. Sevappa Nayak (1532\u20131580), was the first Thanjavur Nayak king.  He was the son of Timmappa Nayak, a Vijayanagara viceroy in the [[Arcot]] region from his wife Bayyambika. The work ''[[Raghunathabhyudayam]]'' written by [[Vijayaraghava Nayaka]] gives some genealogical details of Timmappa. Timmappa or ''Timmabhupati'' was the ruler of North Arcot with his capital at Nedungunram.<ref name=\"Tanjore p.27\">''Nayaks of Tanjore'', by V. Vriddhagirisan, p.27</ref> The epigraphs of all of the Tanjore Nayaks show that they belonged to Nedungunram.<ref name=\"Tanjore p.27\"/> One of Krishnadevaraya's epigraphs mentions that Timmappa also had the high privilege of serving him as a door keeper (vasal) and was the emperor's ''dalavay'' (commander) who took part in the Raichur campaign.<ref>[{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=GD_6ka-aYuQC |page=26 }} ''Nayaks of Tanjore'', by V. Vriddhagirisan, p.27]</ref> According to historian V. Vriddhagirisan, Timmappa Nayak was the brother of Nagama Nayak.<ref>''Nayaks of Tanjore'' by V. Vriddhagirisn, p.151</ref> Nagama Nayak was the father of [[Madurai Nayak Dynasty#Visvanatha Nayakka Ayyar .5B21.5D|Visvanatha Nayak]] (founder of the Madurai Nayak dynastic line). Hence Viswanatha Nayak and Chevvappa Nayak were cousins.\n\nThe work ''Raghunathabhyudayam'' mentions that Timmappa and Bayambika had 4 sons: Pedda Seva, Chinna Seva, Pedda Malla and Chinna Malla. However, not much is known of the other 3 sons. Of the 4 sons, Chinna Seva alias Sevappa Nayak seems to have distinguished himself.\n\nBefore assuming power of the Tanjore kingdom, Sevvappa had distinguished himself under Krishnadavaraya as an administrator and a builder. Sevappa's wife Murtimamba was the sister-in-law of [[Achyuta Deva Raya]] and the sister of the Vijayanagara Queen, Thirumalamba. Some sources suggest that Sevappa acquired the Thanjavur Kingdom as ''[[Stridhana]]'' (dowry) from Achyutadeva Raya. Sevappa was also a ceremonial [[betel]] bearer to [[Achyuta Deva Raya]], the brother of [[Krishnadevaraya]].\n\nAccording to the book ''Arunachala: A short history of hill and temple in Tiruvannamalai'' (pg 54-55), the \"position of a ceremonial betel bearer or ''adaiappan'' (''thambul karandivan'') was a post given to a very trusted subordinate.. and Sevappa being a powerful and influential man of the locality was appointed the first nayak\". The position of a betel bearer was usually not given to an outsider, as this position would make the man privy to all of the king's personal details. Therefore, the position was usually given to a trusted member within the family.\n\n===Achuthappa Nayak===\nSevappa's son, [[Achuthappa Nayak]] (1560\u20131614), was named in memory of Achyuta Deva Raya. He led a peaceful reign of 54 years. Up until 1580 Achuthappa Nayak co-ruled with his father under the Yuvaraja title while immediately after that he was joined by his heir, son Raghunatha Nayak. He was said to be deeply religious and was well considered a master in the art of warfare. His minister was [[Govinda Dikshitar]], a great scholar and a shrewd administrator. His long reign was of comparative peace apart from the internal struggles enabling him to contribute much to spiritual and public utility development.\n\n====Conflicts and wars====\n\n=====Wars with Madurai=====\nDuring Achuthappa's reign, the Vijayanagara Empire was defeated by the [[Deccan sultanates]] armies at the [[battle of Talikota]]. Later when the Vijaynagara rulers re-established their capital in Chandragiri and Vellore under Sriranga Rayas, Achuthappa Nayak continued his loyalty while Gingee and Madurai Nayaks intended to break free by refusing to pay tribute. This would also lead to bitter animosity between the [[Madurai Nayaks]] and the Tanjore Nayaks ultimately leading to the Battle at Vallamprakara where the Tanjore army with the Rayas fought against Veerappa Nayak of Madurai by defeating the latter. Same time when the Rayas of [[Chandragiri]] were waging wars with the Deccan Sultanates in southern [[Andhra Pradesh]] Achuthappa Nayak provided support.\n\n=====Wars with Portugal=====\nPortugal controlled the [[Nagapattinam]] territory as well as the Colombo province in [[Ceylon]] and the entire West Coast of India. The King of [[Jaffna kingdom]] went into a war against Portugal against the methods adopted by the missionary conversions in Jaffna. Later King of Jaffna sought help from the Tanjore Nayaks in repelling Portuguese advances through many battles<ref>['Nayek of Tanjore sends an army of Vadugas with King Varuna Gulata (Varnakula Aditya/Nilayitta) of the Karieas to assist'; The temporal and spiritual conquest of Ceylon, Fern\u00e3o de Queyroz, p. 468]</ref>\n\nAchuthappa Nayak provided land grants to the new Italian settlers who escaped the [[Siege of Malta (1565)|Siege of Malta]] by the [[Ottoman Empire]] with the demand of their conversion to Hinduism.<ref name=\"Nayaks of Tanjore\"/>\n\n====Public contributions====\nAchuthappa Nayak was deeply religious from his young days and the fertile nature of his country helped him make large contributions in gifts and infrastructure to major Temples and also important irrigation systems. The main benefactor was the Srirangam Temple. His assistant and advisor was his [[Minister (government)|minister]] Govinda Dikshita.\n\n=====Srirangam Temple=====\n[[File:Srirangam 1909 stonecarving.jpg|Stone carving at Ranganathaswamy temple in Srirangam.

The Golden Vimana of the inner most shrines (Temple Flag) and the image of God studded with Crown jewels was presented by Achuthappa Nayak.<ref name=\"Nayaks of Tanjore\"/>\n\n=====Other Temples=====\nHis other major contributions include the Pushyamantapas (Halls) with steps leading to river [[Cauvery]] in [[Mayavaram]], [[Tiruvidaimarudur]], Tiruvadi and [[Kumbakonam]] and Golden Kalasas of [[Tiruvannamalai]] Temple Gopurams (Towers) some of the Gopurams in Rameswaram. Several temples in Arcot and [[Tanjore]] regions namely Temples in Tiruvidaimarudur and [[Chidambaram]] received villages as grants.\n\n=====Irrigation=====\nHis one remarkable contribution is the construction of a dam across Cauvery near Tiruvadi leading to efficient irrigation in its vicinity.\n\n=====Housing=====\n\nNumerous [[Agraharam|Agraharas]] (housing for [[Brahmin]]s) in [[Tanjore]] country were built in his period.\n\n====Final years====\nDuring his last days the Rayas now ruling from Chandragiri and [[Vellore]] had rival claimants within the family to the title and were heading for a war with the other Nayak kings taking sides with some suited to their vested interests.\n\n===Raghunatha Nayak===\n[[Raghunatha Nayak]] (1600\u20131634) is regarded as the greatest in the Thanjavur Nayak dynasty. He is famous for his patronage of literature other scholarly research. One of his wives, Ramabhadramba was highly educated and a gifted poet. During his time he granted military assistance to the [[Chandragiri]] ruler [[Venkatapati Deva Raya|Venkata II]] to recover most of his lost areas from the [[Golconda]] forces. In 1620 Raghunatha Nayak permitted a Danish settlement at [[Tarangambadi]].  This encouraged the English to seek trade with the Thanjavur Nayaks. The Tanjore cannon or Raghunatha cannon, supposed to be the largest cannon in the world was installed during Raghunatha Nayak, built with Danish metallurgy know how.<ref name=\"The Hindu\">{{cite web|title= Living History: A cannon in monumental neglect - The Hindu\n|url= http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/history-and-culture/living-history-a-cannon-in-monumental-neglect/article2848696.ece|publisher=The Hindu|date=2012-01-02}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Thanjavur cannon.jpg|thumb|Thanjavur cannon installed during <ref name=\"The Hindu\"/>\n reign]]\n\nRaghunatha was a gifted scholar in [[Sanskrit]], [[Kannada]] and [[Telugu language]]s, as well as a talented musician.

[[Govinda Dikshita]]'s son Yajnanarayana has written an account on Raghunatha's rule in his work ''Sahitya Ratnakara''. Raghunatha was a gifted scholar and an expert in the art of swordplay, a fine marksman and a skilled master in horse riding. In the field of music, Raghunatha created new ragas, talas, and melas like Jayanta sena (Ragam), Ramananda (Talam), Sargita vidya and Raghunatha (Mela). His Sanskrit treatise on music, ''Sangita Sudha'' opened the secrets of music to all. Raghunatha also composed kavyas and dance-dramas like Prabandkas, Parijatapaharana, Valmika Charitra Kavya, Achyutendrabhyudayam, Gajendramoksham, Nala Caritiam and '''Rukmini Krishna Vivaha Yakshagana'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tamilartsacademy.com/journals/volume18/articles/article7.htm |title=Introduction To Sangitasudha |publisher=Tamilartsacademy.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=GD_6ka-aYuQC |page=108 }} |title=Nayaks of Tanjore - V.

Gobburi Jagga Raya, brother of the previous ruler Venkata II's favourite Queen Obayamma claimed her putative son as the King and murdered [[Sriranga II]] along with his family in the Vellore Prison. Jagga Raya was strongly challenged by Yachamanedu, the chief of [[Nayaks of Kalahasti|Kalahasti]] who claimed the throne for Rama Deva, the rightful heir whom he had smuggled out from the Vellore Prison. Jagga Raya sought help from the [[Nayaks of Gingee|Gingee Nayak]] and Muttu Virappa of [[Madurai Nayaks|Madurai]] to attack Yachamanedu and Rama Deva.  Yachamanedu and Ramadeva sought support from Raghunatha, who still treated the Vijaynagar as his authority.\n\n=====The Battle of Toppur=====\n{{main|Battle of Toppur}}\nJagga Raya assembled a large army near [[Tiruchirappalli]], the capital of Muttu Virappa comprising the armies of [[Nayaks of Gingee|Gingee]], [[Chera Dynasty|Chera]], [[Madurai Nayak Dynasty|Madurai]], and some Portuguese from the coast. Yachama led the forces of [[Vijayanagar Empire|Vijayanagara]] and [[Nayaks of Kalahasti|Kalahasti]] from [[Vellore]] and was joined midway by [[Tanjore Nayaks|Tanjore]] forces headed by Raghunatha.Yachama's army was further strengthened by  nobles from [[Karnataka]] and (according to some accounts) Dutch and [[Jaffna]] armies.\n\nBoth the Armies met at the Toppur, at an open field on the northern banks of River [[Cauvery]], between Tiruchirappalli and [[Grand Anicut]] in late months of 1616.  The huge assembly of forces on either side is estimated to be as many as a million soldiers (according to Dr. Barradas in Sewell's Book) and considered to be one of the biggest battles in southern India.\n\n=====Result=====\nIn the Battle Jagga Raya's troops could not withstand the aggression generated by the imperial forces.  Yachama and Raghunatha, the generals of the imperial camp led their forces with great discipline.  Jagga Raya was slain by Yachama, and his army broke the ranks and took flight.  Yethiraja, the brother of Jagga Raya, had to run for his life.  Muttu Virappa tried to escape, he was pursued by Yachama's general Rao Dama Nayani who captured him near [[Tiruchirapalli]].  The Nayak of [[Gingee]] in the encounter lost all his forts except [[Gingee Fort]] and the putative son of [[Venkata II]], cause of all trouble was captured.  The Victory was celebrated by the imperial armies headed by Raghunatha and Yachamanedu, who planted pillars of Victory and crowned Rama Deva as Rama Deva Raya, in early months of 1617.  Rama Deva Raya was barely 15 years old when he ascended the throne.\n\n===Vijaya Raghava Nayak===\n[[Vijaya Raghava Nayak]] (1634\u20131673), was the last of the Nayak Kings of Thanjavur.  He was also called ''Mannaru Dasa''; and like the rest of his family, he built prakaras, gopurams, mandapams and tanks in the Mannargudi Rajagopalaswamy temple.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/mag/2004/05/23/stories/2004052300310400.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Shrine in the forest | date=2004-05-23}}</ref> Vijayaraghava's long reign witnessed a large amount of literary output both in music and Telugu literature. Vijayaraghava's court had a number of poets and literary scholars. Vijayaraghava Nayak wrote more than thirty books in Telugu.<ref name=raghunatha1/> His long reign was sadly brought to an abrupt end by [[Chokkanatha Nayak]] of Madurai.\n\n==End of Nayak rule==\n{{See also|Chokkanatha Nayak}}\nThe end of the Thanjavur Nayak dynasty was brought on by Chokkanatha Nayak, the [[Nayak of Madurai]].  The dispute was due to the refusal of Vijaya Ragava Nayak to give his daughter in marriage to Chokkanatha Nayak.  Chokkantha determined to fetch the maiden by force back into their capital, successfully stormed the Thanjavur palace in 1673 after flattening much of the fort walls by cannons.  But Chokkanatha Nayak was thwarted in his attempts by Vijaya Ragava Nayak, when  he, in a gruesome act of defiance, blew up his daughter and all the other ladies of the palace.  He then charged at the attacking army with his son and his body-guard. He was captured after a brief fight, and was beheaded by the Madurai General Samukham Venkata Krishnappa Nayak.\n\n==Maratha conquest==\nChokkanatha placed his younger brother [[Alagiri Nayak]] on the throne of Thanjavur, but within a year the latter threw off his allegiance, and Chokkanatha was forced to recognise the independence of Thanjavur. A son of Vijaya Raghava induced the Bijapur Sultan to help him get back  the Thanjavur throne. In 1675, the Sultan of Bijapur sent a force commanded by the Maratha general [[Venkoji]] (alias Ekoji) to drive away the Madurai usurper. Venkaji defeated Alagiri with ease, and occupied Thanjavur. He did not, however, place his protege on the throne as instructed by the Bijapur Sultan, but seized the kingdom and made himself king. Thus ended the reign of Nayaks and the start of [[Thanjavur Maratha kingdom|Maratha power]] in Thanjavur.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Madurai Nayak dynasty]]\n* [[Nayaks of Gingee]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Nagaswamy, R ''Tamil Coins- a study'', (1970), State Department of Archaeology, Government of Tamil Nadu\n* Vriddhagirisan V, ''Nayaks of Tanjore'', {{ISBN|8120609964}}, Reprint Annamalainagar 1942 edn., 1995\n* Velcheru Narayana Rao|Rao, David Shulman and Sanjay Subrahmanyam.

The Vijayanagar rulers installed viceroys to rule over various parts of the empire. In 1532 CE, [[Achyuta Deva Raya]], the brother and successor of [[Krishnadevaraya|Krishna Deva Raya]] of Vijayanagar granted Sevappa Nayak, the governor of Thanjavur, permission to establish a feudatory kingdom following his Southern Campaigns against the last Chola ruler.\n{{TNhistory}}\n\n==Literature==\n{{Expand section|date=December 2019}}\n[[Telugu literature]] flourished during the reign of Nayakas in [[Tanjavur]] which was referred to as Southern School of Telugu Literature.<ref name=tel1>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=ZOlNv8MAXIEC&pg=PA269&dq=literature+tajavur+nayaks+telugu&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjhsbHr683mAhU7wjgGHTe3DGUQ6AEIVjAF#v=onepage&q=literature%20tajavur%20nayaks%20telugu&f=false|title=The Garland Encyclopedia of World Music: South Asia : the Indian subcontinent|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=1998|language=en}}</ref> Many Telugu Musicians and Pandits were part of their court.<ref name=tel1 />\n\n==Nayak kings==\n\n===Chevvappa Nayak===\n{{HistoryOfSouthAsia}}\n[[Chevvappa Nayak]] a.k.a. Sevappa Nayak (1532\u20131580), was the first Thanjavur Nayak king.  He was the son of Timmappa Nayak, a Vijayanagara viceroy in the [[Arcot]] region from his wife Bayyambika. The work ''[[Raghunathabhyudayam]]'' written by [[Vijayaraghava Nayaka]] gives some genealogical details of Timmappa. Timmappa or ''Timmabhupati'' was the ruler of North Arcot with his capital at Nedungunram.<ref name=\"Tanjore p.27\">''Nayaks of Tanjore'', by V. Vriddhagirisan, p.27</ref> The epigraphs of all of the Tanjore Nayaks show that they belonged to Nedungunram.<ref name=\"Tanjore p.27\"/> One of Krishnadevaraya's epigraphs mentions that Timmappa also had the high privilege of serving him as a door keeper (vasal) and was the emperor's ''dalavay'' (commander) who took part in the Raichur campaign.<ref>[{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=GD_6ka-aYuQC |page=26 }} ''Nayaks of Tanjore'', by V. Vriddhagirisan, p.27]</ref> According to historian V. Vriddhagirisan, Timmappa Nayak was the brother of Nagama Nayak.<ref>''Nayaks of Tanjore'' by V. Vriddhagirisn, p.151</ref> Nagama Nayak was the father of [[Madurai Nayak Dynasty#Visvanatha Nayakka Ayyar .5B21.5D|Visvanatha Nayak]] (founder of the Madurai Nayak dynastic line). Hence Viswanatha Nayak and Chevvappa Nayak were cousins.\n\nThe work ''Raghunathabhyudayam'' mentions that Timmappa and Bayambika had 4 sons: Pedda Seva, Chinna Seva, Pedda Malla and Chinna Malla. However, not much is known of the other 3 sons. Of the 4 sons, Chinna Seva alias Sevappa Nayak seems to have distinguished himself.\n\nBefore assuming power of the Tanjore kingdom, Sevvappa had distinguished himself under Krishnadavaraya as an administrator and a builder. Sevappa's wife Murtimamba was the sister-in-law of [[Achyuta Deva Raya]] and the sister of the Vijayanagara Queen, Thirumalamba. Some sources suggest that Sevappa acquired the Thanjavur Kingdom as ''[[Stridhana]]'' (dowry) from Achyutadeva Raya. Sevappa was also a ceremonial [[betel]] bearer to [[Achyuta Deva Raya]], the brother of [[Krishnadevaraya]].\n\nAccording to the book ''Arunachala: A short history of hill and temple in Tiruvannamalai'' (pg 54-55), the \"position of a ceremonial betel bearer or ''adaiappan'' (''thambul karandivan'') was a post given to a very trusted subordinate.. and Sevappa being a powerful and influential man of the locality was appointed the first nayak\". The position of a betel bearer was usually not given to an outsider, as this position would make the man privy to all of the king's personal details. Therefore, the position was usually given to a trusted member within the family.\n\n===Achuthappa Nayak===\nSevappa's son, [[Achuthappa Nayak]] (1560\u20131614), was named in memory of Achyuta Deva Raya. He led a peaceful reign of 54 years. Up until 1580 Achuthappa Nayak co-ruled with his father under the Yuvaraja title while immediately after that he was joined by his heir, son Raghunatha Nayak. He was said to be deeply religious and was well considered a master in the art of warfare. His minister was [[Govinda Dikshitar]], a great scholar and a shrewd administrator. His long reign was of comparative peace apart from the internal struggles enabling him to contribute much to spiritual and public utility development.\n\n====Conflicts and wars====\n\n=====Wars with Madurai=====\nDuring Achuthappa's reign, the Vijayanagara Empire was defeated by the [[Deccan sultanates]] armies at the [[battle of Talikota]]. Later when the Vijaynagara rulers re-established their capital in Chandragiri and Vellore under Sriranga Rayas, Achuthappa Nayak continued his loyalty while Gingee and Madurai Nayaks intended to break free by refusing to pay tribute. This would also lead to bitter animosity between the [[Madurai Nayaks]] and the Tanjore Nayaks ultimately leading to the Battle at Vallamprakara where the Tanjore army with the Rayas fought against Veerappa Nayak of Madurai by defeating the latter. Same time when the Rayas of [[Chandragiri]] were waging wars with the Deccan Sultanates in southern [[Andhra Pradesh]] Achuthappa Nayak provided support.\n\n=====Wars with Portugal=====\nPortugal controlled the [[Nagapattinam]] territory as well as the Colombo province in [[Ceylon]] and the entire West Coast of India. The King of [[Jaffna kingdom]] went into a war against Portugal against the methods adopted by the missionary conversions in Jaffna. Later King of Jaffna sought help from the Tanjore Nayaks in repelling Portuguese advances through many battles<ref>['Nayek of Tanjore sends an army of Vadugas with King Varuna Gulata (Varnakula Aditya/Nilayitta) of the Karieas to assist'; The temporal and spiritual conquest of Ceylon, Fern\u00e3o de Queyroz, p. 468]</ref>\n\nAchuthappa Nayak provided land grants to the new Italian settlers who escaped the [[Siege of Malta (1565)|Siege of Malta]] by the [[Ottoman Empire]] with the demand of their conversion to Hinduism.<ref name=\"Nayaks of Tanjore\"/>\n\n====Public contributions====\nAchuthappa Nayak was deeply religious from his young days and the fertile nature of his country helped him make large contributions in gifts and infrastructure to major Temples and also important irrigation systems. The main benefactor was the Srirangam Temple. His assistant and advisor was his [[Minister (government)|minister]] Govinda Dikshita.\n\n=====Srirangam Temple=====\n[[File:Srirangam 1909 stonecarving.jpg|Stone carving at Ranganathaswamy temple in Srirangam.

The Golden Vimana of the inner most shrines (Temple Flag) and the image of God studded with Crown jewels was presented by Achuthappa Nayak.<ref name=\"Nayaks of Tanjore\"/>\n\n=====Other Temples=====\nHis other major contributions include the Pushyamantapas (Halls) with steps leading to river [[Cauvery]] in [[Mayavaram]], [[Tiruvidaimarudur]], Tiruvadi and [[Kumbakonam]] and Golden Kalasas of [[Tiruvannamalai]] Temple Gopurams (Towers) some of the Gopurams in Rameswaram. Several temples in Arcot and [[Tanjore]] regions namely Temples in Tiruvidaimarudur and [[Chidambaram]] received villages as grants.\n\n=====Irrigation=====\nHis one remarkable contribution is the construction of a dam across Cauvery near Tiruvadi leading to efficient irrigation in its vicinity.\n\n=====Housing=====\n\nNumerous [[Agraharam|Agraharas]] (housing for [[Brahmin]]s) in [[Tanjore]] country were built in his period.\n\n====Final years====\nDuring his last days the Rayas now ruling from Chandragiri and [[Vellore]] had rival claimants within the family to the title and were heading for a war with the other Nayak kings taking sides with some suited to their vested interests.\n\n===Raghunatha Nayak===\n[[Raghunatha Nayak]] (1600\u20131634) is regarded as the greatest in the Thanjavur Nayak dynasty. He is famous for his patronage of literature other scholarly research. One of his wives, Ramabhadramba was highly educated and a gifted poet. During his time he granted military assistance to the [[Chandragiri]] ruler [[Venkatapati Deva Raya|Venkata II]] to recover most of his lost areas from the [[Golconda]] forces. In 1620 Raghunatha Nayak permitted a Danish settlement at [[Tarangambadi]].  This encouraged the English to seek trade with the Thanjavur Nayaks. The Tanjore cannon or Raghunatha cannon, supposed to be the largest cannon in the world was installed during Raghunatha Nayak, built with Danish metallurgy know how.<ref name=\"The Hindu\">{{cite web|title= Living History: A cannon in monumental neglect - The Hindu\n|url= http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/history-and-culture/living-history-a-cannon-in-monumental-neglect/article2848696.ece|publisher=The Hindu|date=2012-01-02}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Thanjavur cannon.jpg|thumb|Thanjavur cannon installed during <ref name=\"The Hindu\"/>\n reign]]\n\nRaghunatha was a gifted scholar in [[Sanskrit]], [[Kannada]] and [[Telugu language]]s, as well as a talented musician.

[[Govinda Dikshita]]'s son Yajnanarayana has written an account on Raghunatha's rule in his work ''Sahitya Ratnakara''. Raghunatha was a gifted scholar and an expert in the art of swordplay, a fine marksman and a skilled master in horse riding. In the field of music, Raghunatha created new ragas, talas, and melas like Jayanta sena (Ragam), Ramananda (Talam), Sargita vidya and Raghunatha (Mela). His Sanskrit treatise on music, ''Sangita Sudha'' opened the secrets of music to all. Raghunatha also composed kavyas and dance-dramas like Prabandkas, Parijatapaharana, Valmika Charitra Kavya, Achyutendrabhyudayam, Gajendramoksham, Nala Caritiam and '''Rukmini Krishna Vivaha Yakshagana'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tamilartsacademy.com/journals/volume18/articles/article7.htm |title=Introduction To Sangitasudha |publisher=Tamilartsacademy.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=GD_6ka-aYuQC |page=108 }} |title=Nayaks of Tanjore - V.

Gobburi Jagga Raya, brother of the previous ruler Venkata II's favourite Queen Obayamma claimed her putative son as the King and murdered [[Sriranga II]] along with his family in the Vellore Prison. Jagga Raya was strongly challenged by Yachamanedu, the chief of [[Nayaks of Kalahasti|Kalahasti]] who claimed the throne for Rama Deva, the rightful heir whom he had smuggled out from the Vellore Prison. Jagga Raya sought help from the [[Nayaks of Gingee|Gingee Nayak]] and Muttu Virappa of [[Madurai Nayaks|Madurai]] to attack Yachamanedu and Rama Deva.  Yachamanedu and Ramadeva sought support from Raghunatha, who still treated the Vijaynagar as his authority.\n\n=====The Battle of Toppur=====\n{{main|Battle of Toppur}}\nJagga Raya assembled a large army near [[Tiruchirappalli]], the capital of Muttu Virappa comprising the armies of [[Nayaks of Gingee|Gingee]], [[Chera Dynasty|Chera]], [[Madurai Nayak Dynasty|Madurai]], and some Portuguese from the coast. Yachama led the forces of [[Vijayanagar Empire|Vijayanagara]] and [[Nayaks of Kalahasti|Kalahasti]] from [[Vellore]] and was joined midway by [[Tanjore Nayaks|Tanjore]] forces headed by Raghunatha.Yachama's army was further strengthened by  nobles from [[Karnataka]] and (according to some accounts) Dutch and [[Jaffna]] armies.\n\nBoth the Armies met at the Toppur, at an open field on the northern banks of River [[Cauvery]], between Tiruchirappalli and [[Grand Anicut]] in late months of 1616.  The huge assembly of forces on either side is estimated to be as many as a million soldiers (according to Dr. Barradas in Sewell's Book) and considered to be one of the biggest battles in southern India.\n\n=====Result=====\nIn the Battle Jagga Raya's troops could not withstand the aggression generated by the imperial forces.  Yachama and Raghunatha, the generals of the imperial camp led their forces with great discipline.  Jagga Raya was slain by Yachama, and his army broke the ranks and took flight.  Yethiraja, the brother of Jagga Raya, had to run for his life.  Muttu Virappa tried to escape, he was pursued by Yachama's general Rao Dama Nayani who captured him near [[Tiruchirapalli]].  The Nayak of [[Gingee]] in the encounter lost all his forts except [[Gingee Fort]] and the putative son of [[Venkata II]], cause of all trouble was captured.  The Victory was celebrated by the imperial armies headed by Raghunatha and Yachamanedu, who planted pillars of Victory and crowned Rama Deva as Rama Deva Raya, in early months of 1617.  Rama Deva Raya was barely 15 years old when he ascended the throne.\n\n===Vijaya Raghava Nayak===\n[[Vijaya Raghava Nayak]] (1634\u20131673), was the last of the Nayak Kings of Thanjavur.  He was also called ''Mannaru Dasa''; and like the rest of his family, he built prakaras, gopurams, mandapams and tanks in the Mannargudi Rajagopalaswamy temple.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/mag/2004/05/23/stories/2004052300310400.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Shrine in the forest | date=2004-05-23}}</ref> Vijayaraghava's long reign witnessed a large amount of literary output both in music and Telugu literature. Vijayaraghava's court had a number of poets and literary scholars. Vijayaraghava Nayak wrote more than thirty books in Telugu.<ref name=raghunatha1/> His long reign was sadly brought to an abrupt end by [[Chokkanatha Nayak]] of Madurai.\n\n==End of Nayak rule==\n{{See also|Chokkanatha Nayak}}\nThe end of the Thanjavur Nayak dynasty was brought on by Chokkanatha Nayak, the [[Nayak of Madurai]].  The dispute was due to the refusal of Vijaya Ragava Nayak to give his daughter in marriage to Chokkanatha Nayak.  Chokkantha determined to fetch the maiden by force back into their capital, successfully stormed the Thanjavur palace in 1673 after flattening much of the fort walls by cannons.  But Chokkanatha Nayak was thwarted in his attempts by Vijaya Ragava Nayak, when  he, in a gruesome act of defiance, blew up his daughter and all the other ladies of the palace.  He then charged at the attacking army with his son and his body-guard. He was captured after a brief fight, and was beheaded by the Madurai General Samukham Venkata Krishnappa Nayak.\n\n==Maratha conquest==\nChokkanatha placed his younger brother [[Alagiri Nayak]] on the throne of Thanjavur, but within a year the latter threw off his allegiance, and Chokkanatha was forced to recognise the independence of Thanjavur. A son of Vijaya Raghava induced the Bijapur Sultan to help him get back  the Thanjavur throne. In 1675, the Sultan of Bijapur sent a force commanded by the Maratha general [[Venkoji]] (alias Ekoji) to drive away the Madurai usurper. Venkaji defeated Alagiri with ease, and occupied Thanjavur. He did not, however, place his protege on the throne as instructed by the Bijapur Sultan, but seized the kingdom and made himself king. Thus ended the reign of Nayaks and the start of [[Thanjavur Maratha kingdom|Maratha power]] in Thanjavur.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Madurai Nayak dynasty]]\n* [[Nayaks of Gingee]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Nagaswamy, R ''Tamil Coins- a study'', (1970), State Department of Archaeology, Government of Tamil Nadu\n* Vriddhagirisan V, ''Nayaks of Tanjore'', {{ISBN|8120609964}}, Reprint Annamalainagar 1942 edn., 1995\n* Velcheru Narayana Rao|Rao, David Shulman and Sanjay Subrahmanyam.

Farming households lower their food costs substantially and can generate income by selling excess produce, which is significant, as urban poor commonly spend 50-70% of their income on food.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>  In addition to farming jobs, peri-urban agriculture can spark a need for traders, input suppliers, processors, marketers, and others. Peri-urban agriculture gives women and other non-heads of household a low-barrier occupation through which to support their families, adding to household productivity and giving women an outlet to assert themselves.<ref name=\"URBAN AND PERI-URBAN AGRICULTURE\"/>\n\nProducing food in areas nearby to cities shortens supply chains, which aids quality and cost. The proximity of peri-urban farms to urban areas incurs cost savings compared to those in rural areas, as farms are still able to take advantage of [[economies of scale]], to an extent, and require less transportation infrastructure to bring food in from city outskirts.<ref name=\"link.springer.com\"/> Perishable products are more easily preserved.

Competition for resources with other urban sectors, aspects of agriculture that may be unpleasant for city dwellers, and quality of inputs must all be monitored.\n\nWise resource allocation is a quintessential struggle for agriculture, and is especially greater for peri-urban agriculture than rural agriculture due to its proximity to greater numbers of people and to existing stresses on the urban environment.

Farming households lower their food costs substantially and can generate income by selling excess produce, which is significant, as urban poor commonly spend 50-70% of their income on food.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>  In addition to farming jobs, peri-urban agriculture can spark a need for traders, input suppliers, processors, marketers, and others.

There are physical, chemical, and [[fungal]] threats in the form of roadway exhaust and debris, dense urban populations, water and soil pollution by organic pollutants, industrial chemicals, heavy metals, and [[antibiotics]], and fungal and secondary metabolites.\n\n===Uncertainty of land ownership===\n\nAnother major challenge to the viability of both urban and peri-urban agriculture is land availability due to changing land rights, uses, and values. High population densities lead to competition and conflicts over land and natural resources as land is converted from agricultural to residential and business uses, and as the intensity of agriculture practiced on scarce spaces available increases.<ref name=\"URBAN AND PERI-URBAN AGRICULTURE\"/>  In addition, many urban and peri-urban farmers are urban poor and are frequently women, who tend to be economically vulnerable.<ref>Zhu Keliang and Roy Prosterman, [http://www.chinabusinessreview.com/land-reform-efforts-in-china \"Land Reform Efforts in China\"] China Business Review, 2012</ref><ref name=\"URBAN AND PERI-URBAN AGRICULTURE\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Urban agriculture]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Urban agriculture]]\n", "name_user": "Zanzybar", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peri-urban_agriculture"}
