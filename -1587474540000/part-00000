The WHO calls ''alcoholism'' \"a term of long-standing use and variable meaning\", and use of the term was disfavored by a 1979 WHO expert committee. ''[[The Big Book (Alcoholics Anonymous)|The Big Book]]'' (from [[Alcoholics Anonymous]]) states that once a person is an alcoholic, they are always an alcoholic (but others note that many do recover), but does not define what is meant by the term ''alcoholic'' in this context. In 1960, [[Bill W.]], co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), said:\n:We have never called alcoholism a [[disease]] because, technically speaking, it is not a disease entity. For example, there is no such thing as [[heart disease]]. Instead there are many separate heart ailments, or combinations of them. It is something like that with alcoholism. We did not wish to get in wrong with the medical profession by pronouncing alcoholism a disease entity. We always called it an [[illness]], or a [[malady]]&nbsp;\u2013 a far safer term for us to use.<ref name=\"McGovernWhite2003\">{{Cite book|first1=Thomas F.|last1= McGovern|first2=William L. |last2=White|title=Alcohol Problems in the United States: Twenty Years of Treatment Perspective|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=3gRwmYohuooC|page=7}}|accessdate=17 April 2010|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-7890-2049-9|pages=7\u2013}}</ref>\n\nIn professional and research contexts, the term \"alcoholism\" sometimes encompasses both alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence,<ref>{{DorlandsDict|one/000002709|alcoholism}}</ref> and sometimes is considered equivalent to alcohol dependence. Talbot (1989) observes that alcoholism in the classical disease model follows a progressive course: if a person continues to drink, their condition will worsen. This will lead to harmful consequences in their life, physically, mentally, emotionally and socially.<ref name=Thomb1999>{{cite book|last=Thombs|first=Dennis L|title=Introduction To Addictive Behaviors 2ed|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=Aze4azm9XkQCIntroduction}}|year=1999|publisher=The Guildford Press|location=London|pages=64\u201365}}</ref> Johnson (1980) explores the emotional progression of the addict's response to alcohol. He looks at this in four phases. The first two are considered \"normal\" drinking and the last two are viewed as \"typical\" alcoholic drinking.<ref name=Thomb1999/> Johnson's four phases consist of:\n# Learning the mood swing. A person is introduced to alcohol (in some cultures this can happen at a relatively young age), and the person enjoys the happy feeling it produces.  At this stage, there is no emotional cost.\n# Seeking the mood swing. A person will drink to regain that feeling of euphoria experienced in phase 1; the drinking will increase as more intoxication is required to achieve the same effect. Again at this stage, there are no significant consequences.\n# At the third stage there are physical and social consequences, i.e., hangovers, family problems, work problems, etc. A person will continue to drink excessively, disregarding the problems.\n# The fourth stage can be detrimental, as Johnson cites it as a risk for premature death. As a person now drinks to feel normal, they block out the feelings of overwhelming guilt, remorse, anxiety, and shame they experience when sober.<ref name=Thomb1999/>\n\n====Milam & Ketcham's physical deterioration stages====\nOther theorists such as Milam & Ketcham (1983) focus on the physical deterioration that alcohol consumption causes. They describe the process in three stages:\n# Adaptive stage \u2013 The person will not experience any negative symptoms, and they believe they have the capacity for drinking alcohol without problems. Physiological changes are happening with the increase in tolerance, but this will not be noticeable to the drinker or others.\n# Dependent stage \u2013 At this stage, symptoms build up gradually. [[Hangover]] symptoms from excessive drinking may be confused with withdrawal symptoms. Many addicts will maintain their drinking to avoid withdrawal sickness, drinking small amounts frequently.

Those who approach alcoholism as a medical condition or disease recommend differing treatments from, for instance, those who approach the condition as one of social choice. Most treatments focus on helping people discontinue their alcohol intake, followed up with life training and/or social support to help them resist a return to alcohol use. Since alcoholism involves multiple factors which encourage a person to continue drinking, they must all be addressed to successfully prevent a relapse. An example of this kind of treatment is detoxification followed by a combination of supportive therapy, attendance at self-help groups, and ongoing development of coping mechanisms. The treatment community for alcoholism typically supports an abstinence-based [[zero tolerance]] approach; however, some prefer a [[Harm reduction|harm-reduction]] approach.<ref name=\"Gabbard\"/>\n\n===Detoxification===\n{{Main|Alcohol detoxification}}\n[[Alcohol detoxification]] or 'detox' for alcoholics is an abrupt stop of alcohol drinking coupled with the substitution of drugs, such as [[benzodiazepines]], that have similar effects to prevent [[Alcohol withdrawal syndrome|alcohol withdrawal]].

Individuals at risk of a severe withdrawal syndrome as well as those who have significant or acute comorbid conditions are generally treated as inpatients.

Biblical, Egyptian and Babylonian sources record the history of abuse and dependence on alcohol. In some ancient cultures alcohol was worshiped and in others, its abuse was condemned. Excessive alcohol misuse and drunkenness were recognized as causing social problems even thousands of years ago. However, the defining of habitual drunkenness as it was then known as and its adverse consequences were not well established medically until the 18th century. In 1647 a Greek monk named Agapios was the first to document that chronic alcohol misuse was associated with toxicity to the nervous system and body which resulted in a range of medical disorders such as seizures, paralysis, and internal bleeding. In 1920 the effects of alcohol abuse and chronic drunkenness boosted membership of the [[temperance movement]] and led to the [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition of alcohol in the United States]], a nationwide constitutional ban on the production, importation, transportation, and sale of alcoholic beverages that remained in place until 1933; this policy resulted in the decline of death rates from cirrhosis and alcoholism.<ref name=\"Blocker2006\">{{cite journal |last1=Blocker |first1=Jack S. |title=Did Prohibition Really Work?

Alcohol use is a major contributing factor for [[head injury|head injuries]], [[motor vehicle accident]]s (due to [[drunk driving]]), [[domestic violence]], and assaults.

The WHO calls ''alcoholism'' \"a term of long-standing use and variable meaning\", and use of the term was disfavored by a 1979 WHO expert committee. ''[[The Big Book (Alcoholics Anonymous)|The Big Book]]'' (from [[Alcoholics Anonymous]]) states that once a person is an alcoholic, they are always an alcoholic (but others note that many do recover), but does not define what is meant by the term ''alcoholic'' in this context. In 1960, [[Bill W.]], co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), said:\n:We have never called alcoholism a [[disease]] because, technically speaking, it is not a disease entity. For example, there is no such thing as [[heart disease]]. Instead there are many separate heart ailments, or combinations of them. It is something like that with alcoholism. We did not wish to get in wrong with the medical profession by pronouncing alcoholism a disease entity. We always called it an [[illness]], or a [[malady]]&nbsp;\u2013 a far safer term for us to use.<ref name=\"McGovernWhite2003\">{{Cite book|first1=Thomas F.|last1= McGovern|first2=William L. |last2=White|title=Alcohol Problems in the United States: Twenty Years of Treatment Perspective|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=3gRwmYohuooC|page=7}}|accessdate=17 April 2010|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-7890-2049-9|pages=7\u2013}}</ref>\n\nIn professional and research contexts, the term \"alcoholism\" sometimes encompasses both alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence,<ref>{{DorlandsDict|one/000002709|alcoholism}}</ref> and sometimes is considered equivalent to alcohol dependence. Talbot (1989) observes that alcoholism in the classical disease model follows a progressive course: if a person continues to drink, their condition will worsen. This will lead to harmful consequences in their life, physically, mentally, emotionally and socially.<ref name=Thomb1999>{{cite book|last=Thombs|first=Dennis L|title=Introduction To Addictive Behaviors 2ed|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=Aze4azm9XkQCIntroduction}}|year=1999|publisher=The Guildford Press|location=London|pages=64\u201365}}</ref> Johnson (1980) explores the emotional progression of the addict's response to alcohol. He looks at this in four phases. The first two are considered \"normal\" drinking and the last two are viewed as \"typical\" alcoholic drinking.<ref name=Thomb1999/> Johnson's four phases consist of:\n# Learning the mood swing. A person is introduced to alcohol (in some cultures this can happen at a relatively young age), and the person enjoys the happy feeling it produces.  At this stage, there is no emotional cost.\n# Seeking the mood swing. A person will drink to regain that feeling of euphoria experienced in phase 1; the drinking will increase as more intoxication is required to achieve the same effect. Again at this stage, there are no significant consequences.\n# At the third stage there are physical and social consequences, i.e., hangovers, family problems, work problems, etc. A person will continue to drink excessively, disregarding the problems.\n# The fourth stage can be detrimental, as Johnson cites it as a risk for premature death. As a person now drinks to feel normal, they block out the feelings of overwhelming guilt, remorse, anxiety, and shame they experience when sober.<ref name=Thomb1999/>\n\n====Milam & Ketcham's physical deterioration stages====\nOther theorists such as Milam & Ketcham (1983) focus on the physical deterioration that alcohol consumption causes. They describe the process in three stages:\n# Adaptive stage \u2013 The person will not experience any negative symptoms, and they believe they have the capacity for drinking alcohol without problems. Physiological changes are happening with the increase in tolerance, but this will not be noticeable to the drinker or others.\n# Dependent stage \u2013 At this stage, symptoms build up gradually. [[Hangover]] symptoms from excessive drinking may be confused with withdrawal symptoms. Many addicts will maintain their drinking to avoid withdrawal sickness, drinking small amounts frequently.

Those who approach alcoholism as a medical condition or disease recommend differing treatments from, for instance, those who approach the condition as one of social choice. Most treatments focus on helping people discontinue their alcohol intake, followed up with life training and/or social support to help them resist a return to alcohol use. Since alcoholism involves multiple factors which encourage a person to continue drinking, they must all be addressed to successfully prevent a relapse. An example of this kind of treatment is detoxification followed by a combination of supportive therapy, attendance at self-help groups, and ongoing development of coping mechanisms. The treatment community for alcoholism typically supports an abstinence-based [[zero tolerance]] approach; however, some prefer a [[Harm reduction|harm-reduction]] approach.<ref name=\"Gabbard\"/>\n\n===Detoxification===\n{{Main|Alcohol detoxification}}\n[[Alcohol detoxification]] or 'detox' for alcoholics is an abrupt stop of alcohol drinking coupled with the substitution of drugs, such as [[benzodiazepines]], that have similar effects to prevent [[Alcohol withdrawal syndrome|alcohol withdrawal]].

Individuals at risk of a severe withdrawal syndrome as well as those who have significant or acute comorbid conditions are generally treated as inpatients.

Biblical, Egyptian and Babylonian sources record the history of abuse and dependence on alcohol. In some ancient cultures alcohol was worshiped and in others, its abuse was condemned. Excessive alcohol misuse and drunkenness were recognized as causing social problems even thousands of years ago. However, the defining of habitual drunkenness as it was then known as and its adverse consequences were not well established medically until the 18th century. In 1647 a Greek monk named Agapios was the first to document that chronic alcohol misuse was associated with toxicity to the nervous system and body which resulted in a range of medical disorders such as seizures, paralysis, and internal bleeding. In 1920 the effects of alcohol abuse and chronic drunkenness boosted membership of the [[temperance movement]] and led to the [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition of alcohol in the United States]], a nationwide constitutional ban on the production, importation, transportation, and sale of alcoholic beverages that remained in place until 1933; this policy resulted in the decline of death rates from cirrhosis and alcoholism.<ref name=\"Blocker2006\">{{cite journal |last1=Blocker |first1=Jack S. |title=Did Prohibition Really Work?

Alcohol use is a major contributing factor for [[head injury|head injuries]], [[motor vehicle accident]]s (due to [[drunk driving]]), [[domestic violence]], and assaults.

In the early years, between 1920 and 1950, an Italian [[Catholic]] [[Mission (station)|mission]] was set up in the area. This saw the establishment of St. Joseph's Technical college. Later, in the early 1970s, the technical school was transformed into a government aided secondary school.\n\nFollowing the overthrow of [[Idi Amin Dada]], the then President of Uganda, in 1979, who happened to have his origins there (Amin was a son of the soil, so to speak), Ombaci became the scene of a bloody massacre.\n\nAfter Amin's overthrow during the war, many of his ethnic community sought refuge at the Catholic mission for fear of their lives. However, in 1982, forces of the newly installed government attacked the Catholic mission and killed over 2,000 civilians for belonging to the same ethnic group. Scores were  killed in firing squads in both the Catholic mission and majorly in the secondary school which happens to share a common fence. The Catholic mission grounds have four large mass graves where the victims of this massacre were buried.\n\n==See also==\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[\n\n{{Authority

In the early years, between 1920 and 1950, an Italian [[Catholic]] [[Mission (station)|mission]] was set up in the area. This saw the establishment of St. Joseph's Technical college. Later, in the early 1970s, the technical school was transformed into a government aided secondary school.\n\nFollowing the overthrow of [[Idi Amin Dada]], the then President of Uganda, in 1979, who happened to have his origins there (Amin was a son of the soil, so to speak), Ombaci became the scene of a bloody massacre.\n\nAfter Amin's overthrow during the war, many of his ethnic community sought refuge at the Catholic mission for fear of their lives. However, in 1982, forces of the newly installed government attacked the Catholic mission and killed over 2,000 civilians for belonging to the same ethnic group. Scores were  killed in firing squads in both the Catholic mission and majorly in the secondary school which happens to share a common fence. The Catholic mission grounds have four large mass graves where the victims of this massacre were buried.\n\n==See also==\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{Arua District}}\n\n[[Category:Arua District]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Uganda]]\n[[Category:Cities in the Great Rift Valley]]\n[[Category:West Nile sub-region]]\n[[Category:Northern Region, Uganda]]\n", "name_user": "Fsmatovu", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eOverview", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ombaci"}

It has been at its present site in the [[Culduthel]] area of the city since 1977.\n\n== Catchment area ==\n\nThe school is a six-year comprehensive school serving an extensive area. The associated primary schools are Stratherrick, Aldourie, Cauldeen, Farr, Foyers, Hilton, [[Holm Primary School|Holm]] and Lochardil. Children living within the catchment area who attended St. Joseph's and Bishop Eden primaries also transfer there after Primary 7. Parents living outwith the catchment area can request that their children be placed there. At present around one hundred children live outwith the catchment area and attend the academy.\n\n== History ==\nTracing its history back to the school established by Dominican Friars in 1223 through the town Grammar School in 1668 to the founding of the Academy in 1792, the school has been located at the following locations around the city.\n* Friars Street area (Dominican Priory) 1223-1668\n* Church Street (now the Dunbar Centre) 1668-1792\n* Academy Street (formerly New Street) 1792-1895\n* Midmills building (previously of UHI-Inverness College) 1895 - 1980 and{{Clarify|date=September 2017}}\n* Culduthel Road 1977\u2013 2016\n* Culduthel Road 2016\u2013present\nTHe school is amaingly great @ shinty\nThe school's continuous existence as a developing institution cannot be demonstrated from the surviving evidence, and it is probably safer to interpret that as a succession of educational provisions in and mainly for the burgh, rather than the survival of a single school. There is, however, evidence that concentration on a single site and within a single building was favoured increasingly (as was the pattern elsewhere in Britain and the transatlantic colonies, from which many of the early Academy subscriptions came) in the later eighteenth century, and that the [[grammar school]] would be the focus of this, notably during the Rectorship of Hector Fraser, who taught many of the merchants and lawyers involved in the establishment of the Royal Academy, which was from the first an innovative and self-contained project aiming, as its first minute book amply demonstrates, to provide something like a stepping stone to full university status for the burgh, with a curriculum designed in the light of the ideas of the Enlightenment and dominated not by the Classics but by the sciences and mathematics.\n\nFor the first quarter-century of the Academy's existence something like this ideal was sustained, and the appointments of its Rectors showed a bias towards the emerging sciences - for example that of Alexander Nimmo, who became a disciple of Telford, and left in 1811 to work on civil engineering projects in the West of Ireland.  He was followed by a mathematician, Matthew Adam.\n\nThe Academy was open to girls from the start, and in its English, writing and drawing classes provided the sort of education for girls that middle-class parents were happy with, although there seems also to have been an enthusiasm for geography. In the mid-nineteenth century one girl was adjudged the best mathematics pupil in the school, but could not be awarded the appropriate medal, which went only to boys.\n\nFrom the opening of the Academy in 1792 (when pupils came from all over the Highlands and across the Atlantic, especially the Caribbean - some are shown in the surviving rolls as \"coloured\") a continuous existence can safely be traced, in which major milestones after 1792 were the adaptation to compulsory schooling after 1872, and the demands of the professions generally, which led to the establishment of the new building on the Crown in 1895.\n\nThe school's management was by the Inverness School Board after 1910, and later by Inverness County Council and Highland Regional Council.\n\nOn 28 April 1962 when the school's outdoor club was climbing on [[Stac Pollaidh]], a 15-year-old boy slipped and fell 40 feet to his death.\n\n===Comprehensive===\nThere was movement in the 1950s and 1960s (when Gaelic speaking pupils from the Western Isles were still accepted and housed in the Hostel on Culduthel Road) from fee-paying and selectivity to the status of area comprehensive in the mid and late 1970s, again on a new site.\n\nOn 26 June 1992 the school was visited by [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York]] to celebrate its bi-centenary, with [[Lachlan Mackintosh of Mackintosh]]. On 23 November 2009 his brother, Prince Edward, visited the school, having also visited on 11 June 2003.\n\n==School building==\nThe new school building has 4 floors for a variety of subjects. The ground floor has the guidance base, Year head base, 4 technology workshops, P.E classrooms, 2 large games halls, the learning support department as well as the reception in the front, the canteen under the larger atrium and the cafe area under the smaller atrium. The first floor is home to the theatre located above the staircase in the first floor with a drama studio attached. The fitness suite, the dance studio, geography, history, modern studies, Business studies Graphic communication, engineering science, music and home economics classrooms. The second Floor has the English, Gaelic, French and Maths classrooms as well as a computer room and 2 unisex toilets. The third floor is home to the science classrooms (Physics, Biology and Chemistry), the second computer room and art department with four classrooms.\n\nThe school was awarded \u00a346 million recently in order to construct the new building. The construction commenced in summer 2014 and has recently been completed.

It has been at its present site in the [[Culduthel]] area of the city since 1977.\n\n== Catchment area ==\n\nThe school is a six-year comprehensive school serving an extensive area. The associated primary schools are Stratherrick, Aldourie, Cauldeen, Farr, Foyers, Hilton, [[Holm Primary School|Holm]] and Lochardil. Children living within the catchment area who attended St. Joseph's and Bishop Eden primaries also transfer there after Primary 7. Parents living outwith the catchment area can request that their children be placed there. At present around one hundred children live outwith the catchment area and attend the academy.\n\n== History ==\nTracing its history back to the school established by Dominican Friars in 1223 through the town Grammar School in 1668 to the founding of the Academy in 1792, the school has been located at the following locations around the city.\n* Friars Street area (Dominican Priory) 1223-1668\n* Church Street (now the Dunbar Centre) 1668-1792\n* Academy Street (formerly New Street) 1792-1895\n* Midmills building (previously of UHI-Inverness College) 1895 - 1980 and{{Clarify|date=September 2017}}\n* Culduthel Road 1977\u2013 2016\n* Culduthel Road 2016\u2013present\n\nThe school's continuous existence as a developing institution cannot be demonstrated from the surviving evidence, and it is probably safer to interpret that as a succession of educational provisions in and mainly for the burgh, rather than the survival of a single school. There is, however, evidence that concentration on a single site and within a single building was favoured increasingly (as was the pattern elsewhere in Britain and the transatlantic colonies, from which many of the early Academy subscriptions came) in the later eighteenth century, and that the [[grammar school]] would be the focus of this, notably during the Rectorship of Hector Fraser, who taught many of the merchants and lawyers involved in the establishment of the Royal Academy, which was from the first an innovative and self-contained project aiming, as its first minute book amply demonstrates, to provide something like a stepping stone to full university status for the burgh, with a curriculum designed in the light of the ideas of the Enlightenment and dominated not by the Classics but by the sciences and mathematics.\n\nFor the first quarter-century of the Academy's existence something like this ideal was sustained, and the appointments of its Rectors showed a bias towards the emerging sciences - for example that of Alexander Nimmo, who became a disciple of Telford, and left in 1811 to work on civil engineering projects in the West of Ireland.  He was followed by a mathematician, Matthew Adam.\n\nThe Academy was open to girls from the start, and in its English, writing and drawing classes provided the sort of education for girls that middle-class parents were happy with, although there seems also to have been an enthusiasm for geography. In the mid-nineteenth century one girl was adjudged the best mathematics pupil in the school, but could not be awarded the appropriate medal, which went only to boys.\n\nFrom the opening of the Academy in 1792 (when pupils came from all over the Highlands and across the Atlantic, especially the Caribbean - some are shown in the surviving rolls as \"coloured\") a continuous existence can safely be traced, in which major milestones after 1792 were the adaptation to compulsory schooling after 1872, and the demands of the professions generally, which led to the establishment of the new building on the Crown in 1895.\n\nThe school's management was by the Inverness School Board after 1910, and later by Inverness County Council and Highland Regional Council.\n\nOn 28 April 1962 when the school's outdoor club was climbing on [[Stac Pollaidh]], a 15-year-old boy slipped and fell 40 feet to his death.\n\n===Comprehensive===\nThere was movement in the 1950s and 1960s (when Gaelic speaking pupils from the Western Isles were still accepted and housed in the Hostel on Culduthel Road) from fee-paying and selectivity to the status of area comprehensive in the mid and late 1970s, again on a new site.\n\nOn 26 June 1992 the school was visited by [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York]] to celebrate its bi-centenary, with [[Lachlan Mackintosh of Mackintosh]]. On 23 November 2009 his brother, Prince Edward, visited the school, having also visited on 11 June 2003.\n\n==School building==\nThe new school building has 4 floors for a variety of subjects. The ground floor has the guidance base, Year head base, 4 technology workshops, P.E classrooms, 2 large games halls, the learning support department as well as the reception in the front, the canteen under the larger atrium and the cafe area under the smaller atrium. The first floor is home to the theatre located above the staircase in the first floor with a drama studio attached. The fitness suite, the dance studio, geography, history, modern studies, Business studies Graphic communication, engineering science, music and home economics classrooms. The second Floor has the English, Gaelic, French and Maths classrooms as well as a computer room and 2 unisex toilets. The third floor is home to the science classrooms (Physics, Biology and Chemistry), the second computer room and art department with four classrooms.\n\nThe school was awarded \u00a346 million recently in order to construct the new building. The construction commenced in summer 2014 and has recently been completed. The pupils moved into the new school on 18 August 2016.\n\n==Notable former pupils==\n{{alumni|date=October 2012}}\n{{See also|Category:People educated at Inverness Royal Academy}}\n\n===Grammar school===\n* [[James Macpherson|Seumas B\u00e0n Mac A' Phearsain]] (James MacPherson) - writer of the works he alleged to be translations of works of the Scottish Bard \"Ossian\" which had an enormous influence on European literature, and briefly a Government place-holder in Florida\n\n===Royal Academy===\n* [[Jane Elizabeth Waterston]] (1843\u20131932), (art pupil at the Academy): missionary, teacher, and physician, a member (in 1873) of the first-ever group of women physicians trained in London (by Sophia Jex-Blake) and recognised as the first woman doctor in Southern Africa.\n* Prof Dame [[Sue Black (anthropologist)|Sue Black]] (born 1961) DBE OBE, forensic anthropologist<ref>{{cite web |title=BBC Radio 4 - Woman's Hour, Woman's Hour Power List - Professor Sue Black OBE |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/5mg3lGX2qnzBrctXkTPfQ9S/professor-sue-black-obe |website=BBC |accessdate=27 May 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Murdo Fraser]], Conservative MSP since 2001 for [[Mid Scotland and Fife (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|Mid Scotland and Fife]]\n* [[Iain Gray]], Labour MSP since 2007 for [[East Lothian (Scottish Parliament constituency)|East Lothian]] and [[Edinburgh Pentlands (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Edinburgh Pentlands]] from 1999\u20132003\n* [[Edward Strathearn Gordon]] (1814-1879), created a Lord of Appeal in 1879 with the title Baron Gordon of Drumearn, and twice Disraeli's Lord Advocate.\n* Prof [[G.W.S.

A handful of sides during their [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick]] period were issued by [[Vocalion Records|Vocalion]].\n\nThey signed to [[Decca Records|Decca]] in 1934, formed a touring band, with Tommy as front man, and a rather unusual line up of one trumpet, three trombones, three saxes and four rhythm. The band performed live mainly in the New England area, with acrimony between the brothers steadily building up, until a definitive falling out between Tommy and Jimmy over the tempo of \"[[I'll Never Say Never Again Again]]\" in May 1935, after which Tommy walked off the stage. [[Glenn Miller]] composed four songs for the Dorsey Brothers when he was a member in 1934 and 1935, \"[[Annie's Cousin Fanny|Annie's Cousin Fannie]]\", on which both Tommy and Glenn share the rather racy vocal, \"[[Dese Dem Dose]]\", \"[[Harlem Chapel Chimes]]\", and \"[[Tomorrow's Another Day (1935 song)|Tomorrow's Another Day]]\".<ref name=\"Red\">{{cite web |title=Dorsey Brothers Orchestra |url=http://www.redhotjazz.com/dorseybros.html |website=Redhotjazz.com |accessdate=19 July 2018}}</ref>. Miller left in late 1934 to take up the job as [[Ray Noble]]'s musical director and arranger.\n\nIn 1935, the Dorsey Brothers Orchestra had two No. 1 recordings on Decca, including \"[[Lullaby of Broadway (song)|Lullaby of Broadway]]\" with [[Bob Crosby]] on vocals, topping the charts for two weeks and No. 1 for three weeks.<ref name=\"Reader\">{{cite book|last1=Studwell|first1=William Emmett |last2=Baldin|first2=Mark |title=The Big Band Reader: Songs Favored by Swing Era Orchestras and Other Popular Ensembles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iyJsVIs_L2sC&pg=PA51|accessdate=18 July 2018|year=2000|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-7890-0914-2|pages=51\u2013}}</ref>\n\nTommy Dorsey permanently left the orchestra in 1935 to take over the Joe Haymes band, turning it into Tommy Dorsey and his Orchestra, with the nucleus of the Dorsey Brothers' Orchestra carrying on under Jimmy's leadership. Tommy's chair was filled by the 16-year-old Bobby Byrne. The Dorseys reunited on March 15, 1945 to record a [[V-Disc]] at Liederkranz Hall in New York City. Released in June 1945, the disc contained \"[[More Than You Know (1929 song)|More Than You Know]]\" and \"Brotherly Jump\". The songs were performed by the combined orchestras of Jimmy and Tommy Dorsey. They reunited again in 1947 for the film ''The Fabulous Dorseys''. In 1950, Jimmy disbanded his orchestra and joined Tommy's band on a permanent basis. In the 1950s, they had a network TV series, ''[[Stage Show]]''. [[Elvis Presley]] made his national television debut on their show in 1956. [[Charlie Parker]], who as a fledgling altoist expressed an admiration for Jimmy, died in front of the TV while watching a Dorsey Brothers' show. When in November 1956 Tommy died in his sleep from choking on his own vomit, Jimmy, already desperately ill, carried on for some months with Tommy's silent trombone displayed on stage, until in June 1957 he succumbed to lung cancer.\n\nJimmy and Tommy appeared as the Mystery Guests on the October 16, 1955 airing of ''[[What's My Line?]]''. They were guessed by [[Dorothy Kilgallen]].\n\nIn 1996, the U.S. Postal Service issued a commemorative postage stamp in honor of Jimmy Dorsey and Tommy Dorsey.\n\n[[File:Dorsey Brothers Orchestra Studio 1934.jpg|thumb|Dorsey Brothers Orchestra in the studio, 1934: Pictured are (Back row, l-r): Don Mattison, trombone; Ray McKinley, drums; George Thow, trumpet; Glenn Miller, trombone; Bobby Van Epps, piano.

They started recording in 1928 for OKeh Records.\n\n==History==\nThe Dorsey Brothers recorded songs for the dime store labels ([[Banner Records|Banner]], [[Cameo Records|Cameo]], [[Domino Records (1924)|Domino]], Jewel, Oriole, [[Perfect Records|Perfect]]). A handful of sides during their [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick]] period were issued by [[Vocalion Records|Vocalion]].\n\nThey signed to [[Decca Records|Decca]] in 1934, formed a touring band, with Tommy as front man, and a rather unusual line up of one trumpet, three trombones, three saxes and four rhythm. The band performed live mainly in the New England area, with acrimony between the brothers steadily building up, until a definitive falling out between Tommy and Jimmy over the tempo of \"[[I'll Never Say Never Again Again]]\" in May 1935, after which Tommy walked off the stage. [[Glenn Miller]] composed four songs for the Dorsey Brothers when he was a member in 1934 and 1935, \"[[Annie's Cousin Fanny|Annie's Cousin Fannie]]\", on which both Tommy and Glenn share the rather racy vocal, \"[[Dese Dem Dose]]\", \"[[Harlem Chapel Chimes]]\", and \"[[Tomorrow's Another Day (1935 song)|Tomorrow's Another Day]]\".<ref name=\"Red\">{{cite web |title=Dorsey Brothers Orchestra |url=http://www.redhotjazz.com/dorseybros.html |website=Redhotjazz.com |accessdate=19 July 2018}}</ref>. Miller left in late 1934 to take up the job as Ray Noble's musical director and arranger.\n\nIn 1935, the Dorsey Brothers Orchestra had two No. 1 recordings on Decca, including \"[[Lullaby of Broadway (song)|Lullaby of Broadway]]\" with [[Bob Crosby]] on vocals, topping the charts for two weeks and No. 1 for three weeks.<ref name=\"Reader\">{{cite book|last1=Studwell|first1=William Emmett |last2=Baldin|first2=Mark |title=The Big Band Reader: Songs Favored by Swing Era Orchestras and Other Popular Ensembles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iyJsVIs_L2sC&pg=PA51|accessdate=18 July 2018|year=2000|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-7890-0914-2|pages=51\u2013}}</ref>\n\nTommy Dorsey permanently left the orchestra in 1935 to take over the Joe Haymes band, turning it into Tommy Dorsey and his Orchestra, with the nucleus of the Dorsey Brothers' Orchestra carrying on under Jimmy's leadership. Tommy's chair was filled by the 16-year-old Bobby Byrne. The Dorseys reunited on March 15, 1945 to record a [[V-Disc]] at Liederkranz Hall in New York City. Released in June 1945, the disc contained \"[[More Than You Know (1929 song)|More Than You Know]]\" and \"Brotherly Jump\". The songs were performed by the combined orchestras of Jimmy and Tommy Dorsey. They reunited again in 1947 for the film ''The Fabulous Dorseys''. In 1950, Jimmy disbanded his orchestra and joined Tommy's band on a permanent basis. In the 1950s, they had a network TV series, ''[[Stage Show]]''. [[Elvis Presley]] made his national television debut on their show in 1956. Charlie Parker, who as a fledgling altoist expressed an admiration for Jimmy, died in front of the TV while watching a Dorsey Brothers' show. When in November 1956 Tommy died in his sleep from choking on his own vomit, Jimmy, already desperately ill, carried on for some months \n with Tommy's silent trombone displayed on stage, until in June 1957 he succumbed to lung cancer.\n\nJimmy and Tommy appeared as the Mystery Guests on the October 16, 1955 airing of ''[[What's My Line?]]''. They were guessed by [[Dorothy Kilgallen]].\n\nIn 1996, the U.S. Postal Service issued a commemorative postage stamp in honor of Jimmy Dorsey and Tommy Dorsey.\n\n[[File:Dorsey Brothers Orchestra Studio 1934.jpg|thumb|Dorsey Brothers Orchestra in the studio, 1934: Pictured are (Back row, l-r): Don Mattison, trombone; Ray McKinley, drums; George Thow, trumpet; Glenn Miller, trombone; Bobby Van Epps, piano.
