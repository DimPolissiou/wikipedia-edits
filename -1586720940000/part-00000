It is part of a temple complex on the revered island. It is a [[Buddhist]] temple dedicated to the goddess [[Benzaiten]]. Also, it is said to have first been built in 724 CE under the order of [[Emperor Sh\u014dmu]].<ref name=\"Watsky\">Watsky, A. M. (2004). ''Chikubushima: Deploying the sacred arts in momoyama japan.'' Seattle, WA: University of Washington Press.</ref> The temple has been rebuilt a few times over the years, with a major rebuilding around 1602 CE by the Japanese court officials [[Toyotomi Hideyori]] and [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]].<ref name=\"Watsky\"/> The temple looks to be of Amida style architecture.<ref name=\"Parent\">Parent, M. N. (1983). ''The roof in japanese buddhist architecture.'' New York, NY: Weatherhill/ Kajima.</ref> The temple's gate is originally from the Toyokuni Shrine in Kyoto, but was moved to Chikubu Island during the renovations in 1602. The artwork on the temple's gate has features reminiscent of the Momoyama Period.<ref name=\"Hickman\">Hickman, M. L., Carpenter, J. T., Coats, B. A., Guth, C., Pekarik, A. J., Rosenfield, J. M., & Rousmaniere, N. C. (1996). ''Japan\u2019s golden age: Momoyama.'' New Haven, CT: Yale University Press.</ref>\n\n==Significance of location==\nThe Hogon-ji Temple is special because of its location on Chikubu Island in the Shiga Prefecture in Japan (see fig. 1). Chikubu Island is supposedly one of the places where the goddess Benzaiten, who is related to water and one of the Seven Gods of Luck, lived.<ref name=\"Piggott\">Piggott, J. R. (1997). ''The emergence of Japanese kingship.'' Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press.</ref> [[File:Chikubu island01s3200.jpg|thumb|Figure 1 Chikubu Island]] As Benzaiten supposedly had lived on the island since it had formed, the story goes that one day Amaterasu OmiKami, the goddess who is said to have built Japan, appeared to the reigning Emperor Sh\u014dmu and told him to build structures in order to worship Benzaiten. Thus in 724, the temple complex that includes the Hogon-ji Temple and the nearby Tsukubusuma Hall was originally built.<ref name=\"Watsky\"/> The temple ranks with the Enoshima Shrine in the Kanto Region, and the Itsukushima Shrine in the Chugoku Region as the three great Japanese shrines dedicated to the goddess Benzaiten. The area of Lake Biwa and the surrounding mountains are mentioned many times in the famous story of ''The Tale of Genji''.\n\n==Significance of religion==\nThe Emperor Sh\u014dmu who had the temple originally built was a practitioner of Buddhism.<ref>Hanayama, S. (1966). ''A history of Japanese buddhism.'' ( K. Yamamoto, Trans.). Tokyo, Japan: Bukkyo Dendo Kyokai. (Original work published 1960).</ref> This is important in that the Hogon-ji Temple was built in honor of the goddess Benzaiten, the Japanese adaptation of the Indian goddess [[Sarasvati]], who is also the goddess of eloquence, learning, military prowess, and a musician.<ref>Gunsaulus, H. C. (1924). ''Gods and heroes of japan.'' Chicago, IL: Field Museum of Natural History.</ref> The original temple was rebuilt in 1602 so there is no real documentation on what it actually looked like. However, the rebuilt Hogon-ji Temple strongly resembles the common architectural attributes of a Buddhist Amida Hall. Amida Halls, however, did not reportedly start being built until around 1051 CE<ref>Nishi, K., & Hozumi, K. (1983). ''What is Japanese architecture?.'' (H. M. Horton, Trans.) New York, NY: Kondansha International Ltd.</ref> It is therefore apparent that the style of architecture changed with the reconstruction.\n\nThe Hogon-ji Temple is home to statues and a miniature pagoda in memorial to other deities, as well. There is a statue of [[Acala]], a Buddhist deity that is attributed as being the protector of Buddhism and to aid all beings in showing them the law of the Buddha. Acala is most always seen as having a stern facial expression, holding a sword in his right hand and a rope in his left, and also being surrounded by fire.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shingon.org/deities/jusanbutsu/fudo.html |title=Shingon Buddhist Intl. Institute: Fudo Myoo |publisher=Shingon.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706201137/http://www.shingon.org/deities/jusanbutsu/fudo.html |archive-date=2008-07-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This particular statue is made of a single piece of wood, and is from around the 12th century.<ref name=\"yamasa\">{{cite web|url=http://www.yamasa.org/japan/english/destinations/shiga/chikubu.html |title=Chikubu Island, Lake Biwa, Shiga Prefecture |publisher=Yamasa.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}</ref> The mandorla, or halo around the entire body, of flames are painted and look very intricate. At one time the entire statue may have been painted. The statue's musculature looks very detailed and slightly rounded and soft, a trait reminiscent of Indian works of art. Also, the deity appears to be standing on a rock. This stance on a rock is supposedly another common trait of the iconography of Acala that symbolizes the serenity that he imparts to his followers.<ref name=\"yamasa\"/>\n\nAnother statue is that of a miniature pagoda (see fig. 2). The pagoda is made out of stone supposedly from the famous Mount Hiei. [[File:Hogonji16s3200.jpg|thumb|left|Figure 2 Stone Pagoda]] Due to its special origin, it is only one of seven stone monuments like it.<ref name=\"yamasa\"/> It is five tiered and has an umbrella-like decoration on the top of it. This spire decoration is symbolic of the Buddha and his royalty. Also, on the bottom tier on each side is a picture of Buddha.<ref name=\"yamasa\"/> The architectural style of the pagoda is reminiscent of the style of the Kamakura Period. This is evidenced in the increased incline of the top story roof.<ref name=\"Parent\"/>\n[[File:Hogonji12s3200.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Benzaiten]]]]\nThere is also a sculpture of Benzaiten herself at the temple. Of the three most famous sculptures of this goddess in Japan, the one at Hogon-ji is supposedly the oldest.<ref name=\"yamasa\"/> Also, each year during the very important Lotus Festival a new sculpture of Benzaiten is made and enshrined at the Hogon-ji Temple. An example of these sculptures is this representation of Uga Benzaiten that dates to around 1614 CE (see fig. 3). This sculpture is painted wood, and is approximately 65 centimeters tall.<ref name=\"Watsky\"/> [[File:Benzaiten Sculpture.jpg|thumb|Figure 3 Benzaiten Sculpture]] Uga Benzaiten is a representation of Benzaiten that emphasized her martial qualities and divine power.<ref name=\"Watsky\"/> As shown, Benzaiten is pictured with eight arms, a Buddhist trait, thus emphasizing her greatness and divinity. She is shown holding several types of weapons such as a bow, and sword. However, in her middle right hand she is holding a key. The key along with the magic jewel she is holding in the left hand closest to the middle, are symbols of her abilities in bringing good fortune.<ref name=\"Watsky\"/> On her head is a torii gate for her crown, along with a figure that has a body of a snake and the head of an old man.<ref name=\"Watsky\"/> The lines of the sculpture are very curvy, rounded, and softer looking; yet, because the sculpture is made of wood, Benzaiten looks very stiff and iconic. Because of these stylistic traits, the sculpture was probably influenced by Indian Buddhist iconography.\n\nThe Hogon-ji Temple is also part of the Saigoku Kannon Pilgrimage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://taleofgenji.org/saigoku_pilgrimage.html |title=Saigoku Kannon Pilgrimage |publisher=Taleofgenji.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}</ref> The Saigoku Kannon Pilgrimage, also known as the [[Kansai Kannon Pilgrimage]], is one of the many traditional religious pilgrimages one can take. This particular one is dedicated to Kannon, the Japanese Buddhist adaptation of the Boddhisattva [[Guanyin]] and the Boddhisattva Avalokitasvara.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shingon.org/deities/jusanbutsu/kannon.html |title=Shingon Buddhist Intl. Institute: Kannon Bosatsu |publisher=Shingon.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}</ref> Kannon is mainly represented in 33 different forms; therefore, there are 33 temples in the pilgrimage. In Japan, Kannon's form as the \"Goddess of Mercy\" is especially popular. In this pilgrimage the Hogon-ji Temple is number 30 on the list of 33 temples. The Saigoku Kannon Pilgrimage is a \"miracle pilgrimage,\" for each temple is somehow related to a miracle of Kannon. An example is the Kannonsho-ji Temple that was supposedly built at the request of a merman so that he could worship Kannon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taleofgenji.org/kannonshoji.html |title=Kannonshoji Temple - Saigoku Kannon Pilgrimage |publisher=Taleofgenji.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}</ref>\n\n==Significance of remodeling==\nAs previously stated, the Hogon-ji Temple was majorly rebuilt in 1602 by the court officials Toyotomi Hideyori and Toyotomi Hideyoshi. The temple's architecture must have been altered from the original style because the temple's style looks to be closely related to the popular Buddhist Amida style halls. Also, the renovation in 1602 was when the gate from the Toyokuni Shrine in Kyoto was moved to Chikubu Island and made the gate for the Hogon-ji Temple. The gate has features reminiscent of Momoyama Period artwork. Then later in 1942 the temple was rebuilt again.<ref name=\"Watsky\"/>\n\n==Architectural style==\nThe Hogon-ji Temple (see fig. 4) seen today is very reminiscent of the Amida style Buddhist halls and is a good example of traditional Japanese twists on Chinese architecture. This can be seen in the Chinese trait of the temple being off the ground on a base platform. However, despite the fact that the temple is on an elevated platform, it does not make the building look isolated and removed from its environment as some Chinese structures appear to be, but instead the Japanese architects have made it appear as if it is floating on the terrain and integrated with the environment. The fact that the Hogon-ji Temple was built in honor of Benzaiten probably explains why the temple looks like it is floating on the ground and why flowing lines in the architecture are important. [[File:Hogonji27s3200.jpg|thumb|Figure 4 Hogon-ji Temple]] The temple obviously uses the traditional Chinese and Japanese post-and-lintel style. This is evidenced in the vertical columns that support horizontal beams. The front of the temple appears to have three bays or architectural sections, kens in Japanese terms: one bay on the left side of the doors, the bay with the three doors, and the bay on the right side of the doors. On top of the wooden vertical columns in the front of the temple are typical Japanese 3-on-1 bracket complexes. These bracket complexes are what support the horizontal beams above them. The three part eave on the front of the temple is a stylistic trait of the Amida Halls. The middle section of the temple's exterior makes the temple look as if it is more than one story; however, due to the style of Amida Halls it is most likely just a mokoshi. A mokoshi being a gap in the architectural rafters that make a structure appear more stories than it actually is. Mokoshis also make a structure appear as if it has one roof over another. Note the three-stepped bracket complexes that support the actual roof. Three-stepped bracket complexes are composed of three of the 3-on-1 looking brackets stacked on top of each other with each 3-on-1 bracket supporting a ceiling beam. The ends of these beams can be seen decoratively sticking out from the structure at the corners of the actual roof. This bracket system is a very common trait of traditional Japanese architecture. Also it is documented that the more complex a structure's bracket system is, the more important it supposedly is. Therefore, the Hogon-ji Temple would have been pretty important seeing how it has the complex three-stepped bracketing system. The square flying rafters that extend just to the edge of the underside of the eave roofs and actual roof are an excellent touch that both accentuates the curvature of the roofs and adds a natural element of simple decoration. As apparent, the roof is indeed curved, a trait carried over from Chinese architecture. However, Chinese curved roofs were curved much shallower than their Japanese successors. As seen in fig. 4, the curvature of the temple's actual roof is quite drastic. Also, the downward angle of the actual roof itself is quite steep. This angle is most likely to help with rainwater run-off and symbolic of apotropaic qualities. Curved roofs were commonly believed to ward off evil spirits because evil spirits hated curves and that they would also fall off of the roof due to its drastic angle. Thus, curved roofs are very commonly used in Chinese and Japanese architecture. The sag in both the eave roof and the actual roof is a trait reminiscent of Chinese architecture. Yet, the upward turned corners of the roof are a distinctly Japanese trait that was not seen in Japanese architecture before the Heian period.<ref>Suzuki, K. (1980). ''Early buddhist architecture in japan.'' ( M. N. Parent, & N. S. Steinhardt, Trans.) New York, NY: Harper & Row Publishers, Inc.</ref> The temple has what is termed a hogy\u014d, a pyramidal roof that converges at a central point. Also commonly seen in Chinese and Japanese architecture are ridges curving along the top curves of the actual roof. Overall, the architecture of the temple is very plain and undecorated compared to some of the more ornate temples. This could be because the temple is Buddhist and therefore, its patrons hold to the idea of moderation in life. Yet, because of its simplicity it looks very elegant, flowing, and natural in the surrounding environment.\n\n==Hogon-ji's gate==\nThe Gate of the Hogon-ji Temple, known as the Karamon Gate, was moved to its current location during the temple's renovation in 1602 (see fig. 5). [[File:Karamon Gate Side 1.jpg|thumb|Figure 5 Karamon Gate Side 1]]It was originally from the Toyokuni Shrine in Kyoto that was dedicated to Toyotomi Hideyoshi.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://taleofgenji.org/toyokuni.html |title=Toyokuni Shrine - Kyoto, Japan |publisher=Taleofgenji.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}</ref> The gate itself is an excellent example of Momoyama Period artwork known for its extensive decoration and vibrant colors, even though the architecture of the gate is more Chinese than Japanese. Another aspect to notice is the presence of Buddhist iconography in the gate's artwork. One facet of the Karamon Gate's Chinese architecture is that it uses the previously mentioned post-and-lintel style. Also, the structure uses the common 3-on-1 bracket complexes in holding up the gate and the gate's roof. The gate has a karahafu, or \"Chinese gable\" roof.<ref name=\"Hickman\"/> As seen in fig. 5, the gate has a unique roof curvature that is distinctly Chinese in style. The gate is highly decorated with wood carvings, metal ornaments, polychrome, and sculptural forms. The roof is ornately decorated with embellished tiles that cover the ridges on the rooftop (see fig. 6). [[File:Karamon Gate Side 2.jpg|thumb|left|Figure 6 Karamon Gate Side 2]] The round tiles appear to have the image of a wheel-like flower, the wheel being significant in that it is a symbol of the Dharma, or Buddhist law, cosmology, and the cycle of reincarnation. There is bright gold floral scroll work on the beams of the eaves, at the tops of the doors, and on various joints of the gate. Paintings and carvings of flowers are vastly used overall in the gate's d\u00e9cor, and one entire side of the doors is covered in wood carvings of Peonies. Also, seen in the triangular space on the side of the roof is a bright gold phoenix sculptural figure and cloud decorations. Phoenixes are also a popular decoration for this gate. Not only are phoenixes seen on the side of the roof, but they are also seen at the top of the door on side 1 (see fig. 5). Phoenixes are not the only mythological creature portrayed in the decorations of this gate. On Side 2 of the Karamon Gate, above the door on the left appears to be a dragon and above the door on the right appears to be a horse-like figure (see fig. 7). [[File:Karamon Gate Side 2 Details.jpg|thumb|Figure 7 Detailed View of Side 2]] On the bracket complex on the left door post appears to be the head of a Japanese Lion Dog.<ref>{{cite web|author=Mark Schumacher |url=http://www.onmarkproductions.com/html/shishi.shtml |title=Shishi - Lion Protector in Japanese Buddhism and Shintoism |publisher=Onmarkproductions.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}</ref> Japanese Lion Dogs are also seen painted on each of the panels of the doors on Side 2. These dogs are a common thing to see near Japanese temples and shrines. This is because they are seen as apotropaic, and supposedly ward off evil spirits. They are most often seen in pairs, representing the duality of life. They are Buddhist in origin because their image originated from the lion, which was a symbol of Buddha. The paintings of these dogs on the doors of Side 2 are very colorful, with each dog slightly different from the others. Also, notice that the dogs are in pairs, with two in one row of one door, and two in one row of the other door. The amount of decoration and vibrancy of colors used on the Karamon Gate appear to be a complete antithesis to the Hogon-ji Temple itself. By the differences in style, architecture, and decoration, it is obvious that the gate is not a part of the original temple complex.\n\nFrom the Karamon Gate is the open Funa Corridor that leads to another shrine on the island, Tsukubusuma Shrine (see fig. 8).[[File:Hogonji01s3200.jpg|thumb|left|Figure 8 Funa Corridor]] The Funa Corridor is special because it is built of the wood of the \"Nihonmaru,\" Toyotomi Hideyoshi's ship.\n\n==Hogon-ji's pagoda==\nUp a flight of stairs from the Hogon-ji Temple is the temple complex's pagoda (see fig. 9). It burned down in the early Edo Period and was rebuilt following the original plan.<ref name=\"yamasa\"/> The pagoda is three tiered and reminiscent of traditional Japanese style pagodas in architecture. It is of traditional orange and red coloring. Also, it uses the traditional post-and-lintel style, as previously explained. It has three-stepped bracket complexes, as previously discussed. It consists of three bays, and a central core that runs the entire height of the structure ending in the finial on top. The central pole is evidence that pagodas are like Indian stupas in that it is a common trait in the architecture. The finial [[File:Hogonji115247.jpg|thumb|Figure 9 Hogon-ji's Pagoda]] on top is a symbol of the Buddha, in that it represents an umbrella. An umbrella being significant in that it is a symbol of the historical Buddha's royal lineage and prestige. Pagodas in general are a Japanese adaptation of the Indian [[stupa]]. This is also evidenced by the fact that pagodas were for inducing meditation, circumambulation, and supposedly held a relic of Buddha. This pagoda has two main apotropaic characteristics. One is the obvious curved roof. The other characteristic is the bells hanging at the corners of the roofs that supposedly scare off evil spirits. Overall, the architecture of this structure looks much more decorated than that of the Hogon-ji Temple in its complex use of intersecting beams on the exterior as ornamentation.\n\n==Hogon-ji's treasure house==\nNext to the temple complex's pagoda is the Treasure House. Here several important artifacts relevant to the temple's history are stored.<ref name=\"yamasa\"/> An example of such artifacts include: tapestries, pipes, N\u014d masks, swords, and Buddhas. A tapestry of Benzaiten resides there. In it she is portrayed with only two arms and a ''biwa'', or Japanese lute. This form that emphasized her musical attributes was very popular in Japanese artwork. Seen around her head is a halo, thus emphasizing her divinity. Her robes look very soft due to the curvy lines used. This image is much more reminiscent of the Japanese iconography of deities than that of Indian iconography because the figure appears as organic and soft, not a stiff, stern, and untouchable being. Another evidence of this is the fact that the lines used are not geometric, a trait common in the Indian iconography of deities.\n\n[[File:Chikubushima noh actor.jpg|thumb|left|Figure 11 N\u014d Actor Wearing Mask]] N\u014d masks worn by the actors in that type of theatre (see fig. 11) are especially relevant to the temple's history in that Chikubu Island was the location and Benzaiten was the subject of the famous N\u014d play, ''[[Chikubushima]]''. The play follows the pilgrimage of a court official to Chikubu Island in his journey to pay homage to the deity there. He arrives at the island by an old couples fishing boat and then learns his lesson of judging people because it actually turns out that the old woman is Benzaiten, and the old man the Dragon God of Lake Biwa. The play finally ends with Benzaiten and the Dragon God of Lake Biwa returning to their divine abodes after they both have performed marvelous dances.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Three Great Shrines of Benzaiten]]\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Lady Murasaki.

It is part of a temple complex on the revered island. It is a [[Buddhist]] temple dedicated to the goddess [[Benzaiten]]. Also, it is said to have first been built in 724 CE under the order of [[Emperor Sh\u014dmu]].<ref name=\"Watsky\">Watsky, A. M. (2004). ''Chikubushima: Deploying the sacred arts in momoyama japan.''

New York, NY: Weatherhill/ Kajima.</ref> The temple's gate is originally from the Toyokuni Shrine in Kyoto, but was moved to Chikubu Island during the renovations in 1602.

M., & Rousmaniere, N. C. (1996). ''Japan\u2019s golden age: Momoyama.'' New Haven, CT: Yale University Press.</ref>\n\n==Significance of location==\nThe Hogon-ji Temple is special because of its location on Chikubu Island in the Shiga Prefecture in Japan (see fig. 1). Chikubu Island is supposedly one of the places where the goddess Benzaiten, who is related to water and one of the Seven Gods of Luck, lived.<ref name=\"Piggott\">Piggott, J. R. (1997). ''The emergence of japanese kingship.'' Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press.</ref> [[File:Chikubu island01s3200.jpg|thumb|Figure 1 Chikubu Island]] As Benzaiten supposedly had lived on the island since it had formed, the story goes that one day Amaterasu OmiKami, the goddess who is said to have built Japan, appeared to the reigning Emperor Sh\u014dmu and told him to build structures in order to worship Benzaiten. Thus in 724, the temple complex that includes the Hogon-ji Temple and the nearby Tsukubusuma Hall was originally built.<ref name=\"Watsky\"/> The temple ranks with the Enoshima Shrine in the Kanto Region, and the Itsukushima Shrine in the Chugoku Region as the three great Japanese shrines dedicated to the goddess Benzaiten. The area of Lake Biwa and the surrounding mountains are mentioned many times in the famous story of ''The Tale of Genji''.\n\n==Significance of religion==\nThe Emperor Sh\u014dmu who had the temple originally built was a practitioner of Buddhism.<ref>Hanayama, S. (1966). ''A history of japanese buddhism.'' ( K. Yamamoto, Trans.). Tokyo, Japan: Bukkyo Dendo Kyokai. (Original work published 1960).</ref> This is important in that the Hogon-ji Temple was built in honor of the goddess Benzaiten, the Japanese adaptation of the Indian goddess [[Sarasvati]], who is also the goddess of eloquence, learning, military prowess, and a musician.<ref>Gunsaulus, H. C. (1924). ''Gods and heroes of japan.'' Chicago, IL: Field Museum of Natural History.</ref> The original temple was rebuilt in 1602 so there is no real documentation on what it actually looked like. However, the rebuilt Hogon-ji Temple strongly resembles the common architectural attributes of a Buddhist Amida Hall. Amida Halls, however, did not reportedly start being built until around 1051 CE<ref>Nishi, K., & Hozumi, K. (1983). ''What is Japanese architecture?.'' (H. M. Horton, Trans.) New York, NY: Kondansha International Ltd.</ref> It is therefore apparent that the style of architecture changed with the reconstruction.\n\nThe Hogon-ji Temple is home to statues and a miniature pagoda in memorial to other deities, as well. There is a statue of [[Acala]], a Buddhist deity that is attributed as being the protector of Buddhism and to aid all beings in showing them the law of the Buddha. Acala is most always seen as having a stern facial expression, holding a sword in his right hand and a rope in his left, and also being surrounded by fire.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shingon.org/deities/jusanbutsu/fudo.html |title=Shingon Buddhist Intl.

At one time the entire statue may have been painted. The statue's musculature looks very detailed and slightly rounded and soft, a trait reminiscent of Indian works of art. Also, the deity appears to be standing on a rock. This stance on a rock is supposedly another common trait of the iconography of Acala that symbolizes the serenity that he imparts to his followers.<ref name=\"yamasa\"/>\n\nAnother statue is that of a miniature pagoda (see fig. 2). The pagoda is made out of stone supposedly from the famous Mount Hiei. [[File:Hogonji16s3200.jpg|thumb|left|Figure 2 Stone Pagoda]] Due to its special origin, it is only one of seven stone monuments like it.<ref name=\"yamasa\"/> It is five tiered and has an umbrella-like decoration on the top of it. This spire decoration is symbolic of the Buddha and his royalty. Also, on the bottom tier on each side is a picture of Buddha.<ref name=\"yamasa\"/> The architectural style of the pagoda is reminiscent of the style of the Kamakura Period. This is evidenced in the increased incline of the top story roof.<ref name=\"Parent\"/>\n[[File:Hogonji12s3200.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Benzaiten]]]]\nThere is also a sculpture of Benzaiten herself at the temple. Of the three most famous sculptures of this goddess in Japan, the one at Hogon-ji is supposedly the oldest.<ref name=\"yamasa\"/> Also, each year during the very important Lotus Festival a new sculpture of Benzaiten is made and enshrined at the Hogon-ji Temple. An example of these sculptures is this representation of Uga Benzaiten that dates to around 1614 CE (see fig. 3). This sculpture is painted wood, and is approximately 65 centimeters tall.<ref name=\"Watsky\"/> [[File:Benzaiten Sculpture.jpg|thumb|Figure 3 Benzaiten Sculpture]] Uga Benzaiten is a representation of Benzaiten that emphasized her martial qualities and divine power.<ref name=\"Watsky\"/> As shown, Benzaiten is pictured with eight arms, a Buddhist trait, thus emphasizing her greatness and divinity. She is shown holding several types of weapons such as a bow, and sword. However, in her middle right hand she is holding a key. The key along with the magic jewel she is holding in the left hand closest to the middle, are symbols of her abilities in bringing good fortune.<ref name=\"Watsky\"/> On her head is a torii gate for her crown, along with a figure that has a body of a snake and the head of an old man.<ref name=\"Watsky\"/> The lines of the sculpture are very curvy, rounded, and softer looking; yet, because the sculpture is made of wood, Benzaiten looks very stiff and iconic. Because of these stylistic traits, the sculpture was probably influenced by Indian Buddhist iconography.\n\nThe Hogon-ji Temple is also part of the Saigoku Kannon Pilgrimage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://taleofgenji.org/saigoku_pilgrimage.html |title=Saigoku Kannon Pilgrimage |publisher=Taleofgenji.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}</ref> The Saigoku Kannon Pilgrimage, also known as the [[Kansai Kannon Pilgrimage]], is one of the many traditional religious pilgrimages one can take. This particular one is dedicated to Kannon, the Japanese Buddhist adaptation of the Boddhisattva [[Guanyin]] and the Boddhisattva Avalokitasvara.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shingon.org/deities/jusanbutsu/kannon.html |title=Shingon Buddhist Intl. Institute: Kannon Bosatsu |publisher=Shingon.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}</ref> Kannon is mainly represented in 33 different forms; therefore, there are 33 temples in the pilgrimage. In Japan, Kannon's form as the \"Goddess of Mercy\" is especially popular. In this pilgrimage the Hogon-ji Temple is number 30 on the list of 33 temples. The Saigoku Kannon Pilgrimage is a \"miracle pilgrimage,\" for each temple is somehow related to a miracle of Kannon. An example is the Kannonsho-ji Temple that was supposedly built at the request of a merman so that he could worship Kannon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taleofgenji.org/kannonshoji.html |title=Kannonshoji Temple - Saigoku Kannon Pilgrimage |publisher=Taleofgenji.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}</ref>\n\n==Significance of remodeling==\nAs previously stated, the Hogon-ji Temple was majorly rebuilt in 1602 by the court officials Toyotomi Hideyori and Toyotomi Hideyoshi.

By the differences in style, architecture, and decoration, it is obvious that the gate is not a part of the original temple complex.\n\nFrom the Karamon Gate is the open Funa Corridor that leads to another shrine on the island, Tsukubusuma Shrine (see fig. 8).[[File:Hogonji01s3200.jpg|thumb|left|Figure 8 Funa Corridor]] The Funa Corridor is special because it is built of the wood of the \"Nihonmaru,\" Toyotomi Hideyoshi's ship.\n\n==Hogon-ji's pagoda==\nUp a flight of stairs from the Hogon-ji Temple is the temple complex's pagoda (see fig. 9). It burned down in the early Edo Period and was rebuilt following the original plan.<ref name=\"yamasa\"/> The pagoda is three tiered and reminiscent of traditional Japanese style pagodas in architecture. It is of traditional orange and red coloring. Also, it uses the traditional post-and-lintel style, as previously explained. It has three-stepped bracket complexes, as previously discussed. It consists of three bays, and a central core that runs the entire height of the structure ending in the finial on top. The central pole is evidence that pagodas are like Indian stupas in that it is a common trait in the architecture. The finial [[File:Hogonji115247.jpg|thumb|Figure 9 Hogon-ji's Pagoda]] on top is a symbol of the Buddha, in that it represents an umbrella. An umbrella being significant in that it is a symbol of the historical Buddha's royal lineage and prestige. Pagodas in general are a Japanese adaptation of the Indian [[stupa]]. This is also evidenced by the fact that pagodas were for inducing meditation, circumambulation, and supposedly held a relic of Buddha. This pagoda has two main apotropaic characteristics. One is the obvious curved roof. The other characteristic is the bells hanging at the corners of the roofs that supposedly scare off evil spirits. Overall, the architecture of this structure looks much more decorated than that of the Hogon-ji Temple in its complex use of intersecting beams on the exterior as ornamentation.\n\n==Hogon-ji's treasure house==\nNext to the temple complex's pagoda is the Treasure House. Here several important artifacts relevant to the temple's history are stored.<ref name=\"yamasa\"/> An example of such artifacts include: tapestries, pipes, N\u014d masks, swords, and Buddhas. A tapestry of Benzaiten resides there. In it she is portrayed with only two arms and a ''biwa'', or Japanese lute. This form that emphasized her musical attributes was very popular in Japanese artwork. Seen around her head is a halo, thus emphasizing her divinity. Her robes look very soft due to the curvy lines used. This image is much more reminiscent of the Japanese iconography of deities than that of Indian iconography because the figure appears as organic and soft, not a stiff, stern, and untouchable being. Another evidence of this is the fact that the lines used are not geometric, a trait common in the Indian iconography of deities.\n\n[[File:Chikubushima noh actor.jpg|thumb|left|Figure 11 N\u014d Actor Wearing Mask]] N\u014d masks worn by the actors in that type of theatre (see fig. 11) are especially relevant to the temple's history in that Chikubu Island was the location and Benzaiten was the subject of the famous N\u014d play, ''[[Chikubushima]]''. The play follows the pilgrimage of a court official to Chikubu Island in his journey to pay homage to the deity there. He arrives at the island by an old couples fishing boat and then learns his lesson of judging people because it actually turns out that the old woman is Benzaiten, and the old man the Dragon God of Lake Biwa. The play finally ends with Benzaiten and the Dragon God of Lake Biwa returning to their divine abodes after they both have performed marvelous dances.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Three Great Shrines of Benzaiten]]\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Lady Murasaki.

R. (2006). ''The Periodic Table: Its Story ad Its Significance''; New York City, New York; Oxford University Press.</ref> Around 330 BCE, the [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]] [[Aristotle]] proposed that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more ''roots'', an idea that had originally been suggested by the [[Sicily|Sicilian]] philosopher [[Empedocles]]. The four roots, which were later renamed as ''elements'' by [[Plato]], were ''[[earth (classical element)|earth]]'', ''[[water (classical element)|water]]'', ''[[air (classical element)|air]]'' and ''[[fire (classical element)|fire]]''. Similar ideas about these four elements also existed in other ancient traditions, such as [[Indian philosophy]].\n\n== First categorizations ==\n\nThe history of the periodic table is also a history of the [[Timeline of chemical elements discoveries|discovery of the chemical elements]]. The first person in history to discover a new element was [[Hennig Brand]], a [[Bankruptcy|bankrupt]] [[Germans|German]] merchant. Brand tried to discover the [[Philosopher's Stone]]\u2014a mythical object that was supposed to turn inexpensive base [[metal]]s into gold. In 1669 (or later), his experiments with [[Distillation|distilled]] human [[urine]] resulted in the production of a glowing white substance, which he called \"cold fire\" (''kaltes Feuer'').<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/discoveryoftheel002045mbp#page/n135/mode/2up|title=Discovery of the Elements|last1=Weeks|first1=Mary|date=1956|publisher=Journal of Chemical Education|edition=6th|location=Easton, Pennsylvania, USA|page=122}}</ref> He kept his discovery secret until 1680, when [[Robert Boyle]] rediscovered phosphorus and published his findings.

Lavoisier defined an element as a substance that cannot be broken down into a simpler substance by a chemical reaction.<ref>Lavoisier with Robert Kerr, trans. (1790) ''Elements of Chemistry''. Edinburgh, Scotland: William Creech. [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=gri.ark:/13960/t5v735k9h;view=1up;seq=30 From p. xxiv:] \"I shall therefore only add upon this subject, that if, by the term ''elements'', we mean to express those simple and indivisible atoms of which matter is composed, it is extremely probable we know nothing at all about them; but, if we apply the term ''elements'', or ''principles of bodies'', to express our idea of the last point which analysis is capable of reaching, we must admit, as elements, all substances into which we are capable, by any means, to reduce bodies by decomposition. Not that we are entitled to affirm, that these substances we consider as simple may not be compounded of two, or even of a greater number of principles; but, since these principles cannot be separated, or rather since we have not hitherto discovered means of separating them, they act with regard to us as simple substances, and we ought never to suppose them compounded until experiment and observation has proved them to be so.\"</ref> This simple definition served for a century and lasted until the discovery of [[subatomic particle]]s. Lavoisier's book contained a list of \"simple substances\" that Lavoisier believed could not be broken down further, which included [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], [[hydrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[zinc]] and [[sulfur]], which formed the basis for the modern list of elements. Lavoisier's list also included '[[light]]' and '[[Caloric theory|caloric]]', which at the time were believed to be material substances. He classified these substances into metals and nonmetals. While many leading [[chemist]]s refused to believe Lavoisier's new revelations, the ''Elementary Treatise'' was written well enough to convince the younger generation.

In 1864, a book of his was published; it contained an early version of the periodic table containing 28 elements, and classified elements into six families by their [[valence (chemistry)|valence]]\u2014for the first time, elements had been grouped according to their valence. Works on organizing the elements by atomic weight had until then been stymied by inaccurate measurements of the atomic weights.<ref name=\"Meyer table\" /> In 1868, he revised his table, but this revision was published as a draft only after his death. In a paper dated December 1869 which appeared early in 1870, Meyer published a new periodic table of 55 elements, in which the series of periods are properly ended by an element of the alkaline earth metal group. The paper also included a line chart of relative atomic volumes, which illustrated periodic relationships of physical characteristics of the elements, and which assisted Meyer in deciding where elements should appear in his periodic table. By this time he had already seen the publication of Mendeleev's first periodic table, but his work appears to have been largely independent.<ref name=scerri06/>\n\nRussian chemist [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] arranged the elements by [[atomic mass]], corresponding to relative [[molar mass]].

Mendeleev also figured some spots in his ordering had no element to match, and he left gaps on account of future discoveries of these elements, using the elements before and after those missing ones to predict their properties.

He correctly determined the atomic number of all elements up to atomic number 50 ([[tin]]), though he made several errors with heavier elements. However, Broek did not have any method to experimentally verify the atomic numbers of elements; thus, they were still believed to be a consequence of atomic weight, which remained in use in ordering elements.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nMoseley was determined to test Broek's hypothesis.<ref name=moseley2010/> After a year of investigation of the [[Fraunhofer lines]] of various elements, he found a relationship between the X-ray [[wavelength]] of an element and its atomic number.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Moseley|first1=H.G.J.|title=The high-frequency spectra of the elements|journal=Philosophical Magazine|date=1914|volume=27|pages=703\u2013713|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x002266051;view=1up;seq=731|series=6th series|doi=10.1080/14786440408635141}}</ref> With this, Moseley obtained the first accurate measurements of atomic numbers and determined an absolute sequence to the elements, allowing him to restructure the periodic table.

The determination of atomic numbers also clarified the order of chemically similar rare earth elements; it was also used to confirm that [[Georges Urbain]]'s claimed discovery of a new rare earth element ([[celtium]]) was invalid, earning Moseley acclamation for this technique.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nIn 1914, Swedish physicist [[Johannes Rydberg]] noticed that the atomic numbers of the noble gases was equal to doubled sums of squares of simple numbers: 2 = 1<sup>2</sup>, 10 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup>), 18 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup>), 36 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup>), 54 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup>), 86 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 4<sup>2</sup>).

Lavoisier defined an element as a substance that cannot be broken down into a simpler substance by a chemical reaction.<ref>Lavoisier with Robert Kerr, trans. (1790) ''Elements of Chemistry''.

Not that we are entitled to affirm, that these substances we consider as simple may not be compounded of two, or even of a greater number of principles; but, since these principles cannot be separated, or rather since we have not hitherto discovered means of separating them, they act with regard to us as simple substances, and we ought never to suppose them compounded until experiment and observation has proved them to be so.\"</ref> This simple definition served for a century and lasted until the discovery of [[subatomic particle]]s. Lavoisier's book contained a list of \"simple substances\" that Lavoisier believed could not be broken down further, which included [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], [[hydrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[zinc]] and [[sulfur]], which formed the basis for the modern list of elements. Lavoisier's list also included '[[light]]' and '[[Caloric theory|caloric]]', which at the time were believed to be material substances. He classified these substances into metals and nonmetals. While many leading [[chemist]]s refused to believe Lavoisier's new revelations, the ''Elementary Treatise'' was written well enough to convince the younger generation.

Works on organizing the elements by atomic weight had until then been stymied by inaccurate measurements of the atomic weights.<ref name=\"Meyer table\" /> In 1868, he revised his table, but this revision was published as a draft only after his death.

The paper also included a line chart of relative atomic volumes, which illustrated periodic relationships of physical characteristics of the elements, and which assisted Meyer in deciding where elements should appear in his periodic table.

He correctly determined the atomic number of all elements up to atomic number 50 ([[tin]]), though he made several errors with heavier elements. However, Broek did not have any method to experimentally verify the atomic numbers of elements; thus, they were still believed to be a consequence of atomic weight, which remained in use in ordering elements.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nMoseley was determined to test Broek's hypothesis.<ref name=moseley2010/> After a year of investigation of the [[Fraunhofer lines]] of various elements, he found a relationship between the X-ray [[wavelength]] of an element and its atomic number.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Moseley|first1=H.G.J.|title=The high-frequency spectra of the elements|journal=Philosophical Magazine|date=1914|volume=27|pages=703\u2013713|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x002266051;view=1up;seq=731|series=6th series|doi=10.1080/14786440408635141}}</ref> With this, Moseley obtained the first accurate measurements of atomic numbers and determined an absolute sequence to the elements, allowing him to restructure the periodic table. Moseley's research immediately resolved discrepancies between atomic weight and chemical properties, where sequencing strictly by atomic weight would result in groups with inconsistent chemical properties. For example, his measurements of X-ray wavelengths enabled him to correctly place [[argon]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;18) before [[potassium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;19), [[cobalt]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;27) before [[nickel]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;28), as well as [[tellurium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;52) before [[iodine]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;53), in line with [[periodic trends]]. The determination of atomic numbers also clarified the order of chemically similar rare earth elements; it was also used to confirm that [[Georges Urbain]]'s claimed discovery of a new rare earth element ([[celtium]]) was invalid, earning Moseley acclamation for this technique.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nIn 1914, Swedish physicist [[Johannes Rydberg]] noticed that the atomic numbers of the noble gases was equal to doubled sums of squares of simple numbers: 2 = 1<sup>2</sup>, 10 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup>), 18 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup>), 36 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup>), 54 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup>), 86 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 4<sup>2</sup>). This finding was accepted as an explanation of the fixed lengths of periods and led to repositioning of the noble gases from the left edge of the table to the right.<ref name=\"Trifonov\" /> Unwillingness of the noble gases to engage in chemical reaction was explained in the alluded stability of closed noble gas electron configurations; the from this notion emerged the [[octet rule]].<ref name=\"Trifonov\" /> Among the notable works that established the importance of the periodicity of eight were the [[valence bond theory]], published in 1916 by American chemist [[Gilbert N.

The [[Bohr model]] was developed during this time, and championed the idea of [[electron configuration]]s that determine chemical properties.

He explained the chemical properties of transition elements as a consequence of the filling of an inner subshell rather than the valence shell. This proposition, based upon the work of American chemist [[Gilbert N.

Many agreed that the next noble gas after radon would most likely have the atomic number 118, from which it followed that the transition series in the [[period 7 element|seventh period]] should resemble those in the [[period 6 element|sixth]]. Although it was thought that these transition series would include a series analogous to the rare earth elements, characterized by filling of the 5f shell, it was unknown where this series began. Predictions ranged from atomic number 90 (thorium) to 99, many of which proposed a beginning beyond the known elements (at or beyond atomic number 93). The elements from [[actinium]] to uranium were instead believed to form part of a fourth series of transition metals because of their high [[oxidation state]]s; accordingly, they were placed in groups 3 through 6.<ref name=seaborg2>{{cite book |last=Seaborg |first=G. |title=Lanthanides/Actinides: Chemistry |chapter=Origin of the Actinide Concept |series=Handbook on the Physics and Chemistry of Rare Earths |volume=18 |edition=1 |date=1994 |isbn=9780444536648 |id=LBL-31179 |chapter-url=https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt7cz371hx/qt7cz371hx.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIn 1940, [[neptunium]] and [[plutonium]] were the first [[transuranic element]]s to be discovered; they were placed in sequence beneath [[rhenium]] and [[osmium]], respectively. However, preliminary investigations of their chemistry suggested a greater similarity to uranium than to lighter transition metals, challenging their placement in the periodic table.<ref name=clark/> During his [[Manhattan Project]] research in 1943, [[Glenn T. Seaborg]] experienced unexpected difficulties in isolating the elements [[americium]] and [[curium]], as they were believed to be part of a fourth series of transition metals.

The actinide series is the second row of the f-block (5f series), and comprises the elements from [[actinium]] to [[lawrencium]]. In both the actinide and lanthanide series, an inner [[electron shell]] is being filled.\n\nSeaborg's subsequent elaborations of the actinide concept theorized a series of [[Transuranium element|superheavy elements]] in a [[transactinide]] series comprising elements from [[Rutherfordium|104]] to [[Unbiunium|121]] and a [[superactinide]] series of elements from [[Unbibium|122]] to 153.<ref name=clark /> He proposed an [[extended periodic table]] with an additional period of 50&nbsp;elements (thus reaching element&nbsp;168); this eighth period was derived from an extrapolation of the [[Aufbau principle]] and placed elements&nbsp;121 to&nbsp;138 in a g-block, in which a new g subshell would be filled.<ref name=transu1>{{cite book |last=Hoffman |first=D.C |last2=Ghiorso |first2=A. |last3=Seaborg |first3=G.T. |title=The Transuranium People: The Inside Story |publisher=Imperial College Press |date=2000 |isbn=978-1-86094-087-3 |page=435\u2013436}}</ref> Seaborg's model, however, did not take into account [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]] resulting from high atomic number and electron orbital speed.

Any newly discovered elements will thus be placed in an eighth period.\n\nDespite the completion of the seventh period, experimental chemistry of some transactinides has been shown to be inconsistent with the periodic law. In the 1990s, Ken Czerwinski at [[University of California, Berkeley]] observed similarities between rutherfordium and plutonium and dubnium and protactinium, rather than a clear continuation of periodicity in groups&nbsp;4 and&nbsp;5. More recent experiments on [[copernicium]] and [[flerovium]] have yielded inconsistent results, some of which suggest that these elements behave more like the noble gas [[radon]] rather than mercury and lead, their respective [[congener (chemistry)|congener]]s. As such, the chemistry of many superheavy elements has yet to be well-characterized, and it remains unclear whether the periodic law can still be used to extrapolate the properties of undiscovered elements.<ref name=\"NYT-20190827\">{{cite news |last=Roberts |first=Siobhan |title=Is It Time to Upend the Periodic Table? - The iconic chart of elements has served chemistry well for 150 years.
