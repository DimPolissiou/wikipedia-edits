About 2,500 years ago, mound-building Native Americans settled in the area and built the complex that now forms the [[Crystal River Archaeological State Park|Crystal River Archeological Site]].

Planned industrial development surrounding the construction of the [[Cross Florida Barge Canal]] never came to fruition when the partially-built canal was terminated after environmental opposition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citrusbocc.com/aboutus/history.htm|title=Citrus County - A Little History|website=www.citrusbocc.com}}</ref>  A later attempt to create a port ('''Port Citrus''') from the portion of the canal that was completed resulted in no significant progress and the county voted in 2015 to scuttle the project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://citrustimesonline.com/port-citrus-scuttled-2/2015/01/31/.html|title=Port Citrus Scuttled|author=|date=February 1, 2015|website=citrustimesonline.com}}</ref>\n\nThe original Citrus County seat was Mannfield (also spelled, incorrectly, Mansfield or Mannsfeld in some sources).

A native of Utica, New York, Wuest was heavily influenced by the [[Germany|German]] electronic music scene of the 1970s, including [[Klaus Schulze]], [[Popol Vuh (German band)|Popol Vuh]], [[Tangerine Dream]], [[Kraftwerk]], and [[Harmonia (band)|Harmonia]].  Around the same time, Utica guitarist Dennis Rea had founded what he describes as an \"eccentric [[progressive rock]] band,\" Zuir.  According to Rea, \"...being the only two adventurous music acts in town, collaboration between Craig and the members of Zuir was inevitable.\"<ref name=\"Expose\"/>\n\nRea also recalls concerts during the Utica period: \"The group performed live only a handful of times, mostly at inappropriate venues like roadhouse bars and college beer halls, with predictable results.\"<ref name=\"Expose\"/>\n\n=== 1979\u20131983 (Germany and Sky) ===\n\nCraig Wuest was an admirer of electronic music pioneer [[Klaus Schulze]], with whom he struck up a correspondence.  Schulze encouraged Wuest and Earthstar to come to Germany, intending to sign them to his [[Innovative Communications]] record label.  Wuest sold his grand piano, which had played a prominent part on ''Salterbarty Tales,'' to finance the move.<ref name=\"Expose\"/>\n\nWhile much of ''French Skyline'' was recorded at Klaus Schulze studios in [[Hamb\u00fchren]], [[West Germany]], with additional recording taking place at IC Studios in [[Ovelg\u00f6nne]], Schulze's label never signed Earthstar. The group's next three albums were released by [[Hamburg]]-based Sky Records instead, beginning with ''French Skyline'' in 1979,<ref name=\"Sky\">{{cite web\n  | last =\n  | first =\n  | authorlink =\n  | title =SKY\n  | work =\n  | publisher = Thunder Collectors pages\n  | date = 2006-02-20\n  | url =http://www.tom-thunder.de/Music-Archive/Sky.htm\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate =2007-10-29  }}</ref><ref name=\"Sky2\">{{cite web\n  | last =\n  | first =\n  | authorlink =\n  | title = Sky Records\n  | work =\n  | publisher = Discogs\n  | url =http://www.discogs.com/label/Sky+Records\n  | format =\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 2007-10-29}}</ref> which was co-produced by Schulze and Wuest.

Nein, Danke!]]'' (literally \"Nuclear power?  No, thank you!\"), was an environmental [[tone poem]].  The album was recorded in 1979 and 1980 and was released on February 1, 1981.  The Planet Mellotron Web site describes it as \"more laid back\" than ''French Skyline'' and \"...an ideal opportunity to hear the rarest tape-replay instrument,\" the Birotron.<ref name=\"Mellotron\"/>\n \nA third album for Sky, ''[[Humans Only]]'', was recorded in 1981 and released the following year.  The album was the result of a partnership between Wuest and Utica-based guitarist and songwriter Dan Hapanowicz.<ref name=\"GEPR\"/>\n\n=== Later works? ===\n\nAccording to Dennis Rea, Earthstar dissolved not long after the release of ''Humans Only.''<ref name=\"GEPR\"/>  A now defunct earthstarmusic.com Web site listed three later releases.

A native of Utica, New York, Wuest was heavily influenced by the [[Germany|German]] electronic music scene of the 1970s, including [[Klaus Schulze]], [[Popol Vuh (German band)|Popol Vuh]], [[Tangerine Dream]], [[Kraftwerk]], and [[Harmonia (band)|Harmonia]].  Around the same time, Utica guitarist Dennis Rea had founded what he describes as an \"eccentric [[progressive rock]] band,\" Zuir.  According to Rea, \"...being the only two adventurous music acts in town, collaboration between Craig and the members of Zuir was inevitable.\"<ref name=\"Expose\"/>\n\nRea also recalls concerts during the Utica period: \"The group performed live only a handful of times, mostly at inappropriate venues like roadhouse bars and college beer halls, with predictable results.\"<ref name=\"Expose\"/>\n\n=== 1979\u20131983 (Germany and Sky) ===\n\nCraig Wuest was an admirer of electronic music pioneer [[Klaus Schulze]], with whom he struck up a correspondence.  Schulze encouraged Wuest and Earthstar to come to Germany, intending to sign them to his [[Innovative Communications]] record label.  Wuest sold his grand piano, which had played a prominent part on ''Salterbarty Tales,'' to finance the move.<ref name=\"Expose\"/>\n\nWhile much of ''French Skyline'' was recorded at Klaus Schulze studios in [[Hamb\u00fchren]], [[West Germany]], with additional recording taking place at IC Studios in [[Ovelg\u00f6nne]], Schulze's label never signed Earthstar.

Cain is said to have fled from his father, married a princess whom he met at a well, and was involved with metalworkers. Most of the heroes of Genesis met their wives at sacred wells or springs. Abraham married Keturah at the Well of Sheba (Beersheva). Issac (Yitzak) found a wife at a well in Aram. Moses encountered his wife at a well sacred to the Midianites and won her hand after he delivered the women and flocks from Egyptian raiders.\n\nThe antiquity of the Hausa origins account is believed to be attested by the role which water plays in the story. In the ancient world shrines were built along rivers and at wells or springs from West Central Africa to the Indus River Valley. Serpents inhabited these places and were both venerated and feared.

Linsley, maintains that Bayajidda's closest biblical counterpart is Cain [http://jandyongenesis.blogspot.com/2010/01/conversation-with-hausa-muslim.html]. Cain is said to have fled from his father, married a princess whom he met at a well, and was involved with metalworkers. Most of the heroes of Genesis met their wives at sacred wells or springs. Abraham married Keturah at the Well of Sheba (Beersheva). Issac (Yitzak) found a wife at a well in Aram. Moses encountered his wife at a well sacred to the Midianites and won her hand after he delivered the women and flocks from Egyptian raiders.\n\nThe antiquity of the Hausa origins account is believed to be attested by the role which water plays in the story. In the ancient world shrines were built along rivers and at wells or springs from West Central Africa to the Indus River Valley. Serpents inhabited these places and were both venerated and feared. In Sanskrit serpent is ''naaga'', in Hebrew ''nahash'', and in Hausa the serpent is ''naja''.\n\nIn his 1989 book ''An Imperial Twilight'', Gawain Bell suggests that the marriage of Bayajidda and Daurama signals a \"change from a matriarchal to a patriarchal system.\"<ref name=aip>{{cite book |last=Bell |first=Gawain |title= An Imperial Twilight|url= https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1870915062&id=CrAgAAAAMAAJ&q=abuyazidu&dq=abuyazidu&pgis=1 |accessdate= 2007-03-15|year= 1989|publisher= Lester Crook Academic Publishing|isbn= 1-870915-06-2|oclc= |doi= |id= |chapter=|quote=|page= 290 }}</ref> (Prior to the arrival of Bayajidda, the Daura monarchy would have been exclusively female.)\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Barth, Heinrich: ''Travel and Discoveries in North and Central Africa'', 3 vols., New York, 1857-9.\n* Hallam, W.

These missions occasionally provoked reactions, sometimes hostile, from behind the Iron Curtain. On April 8, 1950, Soviet [[Lavochkin La-11]] fighters shot down a Lyautey-based PB4Y-2 Privateer (BUNO 59645) over the Baltic Sea, off the coast of Liep\u0101ja, Latvia with the loss of all ten aircrew<ref name=\"StaHypo1\">{{Cite web|title = History Of VQ-2.

As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines. Having lost an aircraft and lives to hostile Soviet action, the aircrew appreciated the added takeoff and combat speed of the two [[Allison J33-A-10A]] turbojet engines mounted in the aft of the [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360-20A Wasp Major]] radial's nacelles<ref name=\"East\">East, Don C.</ref>. \n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A. By mid-1954, four P4M-1Qs and one [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2V-2 Neptune]] were at Lyautey. The P2V-2, stripped of ASW equipment, served as a trainer and logistics aircraft<ref name=\"StaHypo2\">{{Cite web|title = History Of VQ-2.

Regular deployment sites were [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik]], [[RAF Mildenhall|Mildehnall], [[Lucius D.

At commissioning, Commander Morris L. Kalin led a total complement of 24 officers and 78 enlisted men<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant.]]\n[[File:P2V-5 NAS Jacksonville 1952.jpg|thumb|left|P2V-5 with nose turret in 1952. The Lyautey P2V-5Fs had additional turbojets mounted on nacelles where the rockets are in this photo.]]\nThe squadron continued using the six P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. In addition, they obtained three Lockheed P2V-5Fs. The P2V-5Fs were reconfigured onsite from the standard maritime reconnaissance to similar electronic suites as the P-4Ms. Of note, the P2v-5Fs had the same dash speed capability as the P4Ms from two [[Westinghouse J34]]-WE-34 turbojets mounted on their own nacelles outboard the [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone|Wright R-3350-32W Cyclone Turbo-compound]] radials. The squadron used the P2V-3 for pilot training and logistics, since it was not configured for electronic reconnaissance (this became a standard squadron practice when possible; using a \"bare bones airframe of one of its models for training and logistics)<ref name=\"East\" />. The four Neptunes would serve alongside the Mercators until 1960.\n\nIn September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron. The A3D-1Q, nicknamed \"The Whale\" was a reconfigured A3D-1 with the bombay closed and an electronic reconnaissance suite installed similar to those of the P4M-1Q and P2V-5F<ref name=\"Francillon\">Francillon</ref><ref name=\"Heinemann\">Heinemann</ref><ref name=\"Gunston\">Gunston</ref>. The Whale was a carrier-capable high-wing, twin-jet aircraft with a crew of four<ref name= \"Winchester\">Winchester 2006, p. 75.</ref>. The A-3 was also one of the fastest non-afterburner aircraft in the US Armed Forces with a service ceiling significantly higher than the Mercators and Neptunes which gave the aircraft a greater area of coverage<ref name=East\" />. The squadron also received an A3D-1 which it use like the P2V-3<ref name=\"East\" />. Although the pilots and navigators came to the command after carrier-qualifying, the squadron operated the A-3 from land bases until the next decade unlike her sister squadron VQ-1<ref name=\"Hypo2\" /><ref name=\"East\" />. With the high tempo of operations and depot-level maintenance for the three models back in the continental United States (CONUS), it is unsurprising that on 1 June 1957, the command had three P4M-1Q,, two A3D-1Q, two P2V-5F, one A3D-1, and one P2V-3 reported in its table of organization (TOE)<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\nThe [[1958 Lebanon crisis|Lebanon Crisis in 1958]] on 15 July 1958, saw a p4M-1Q and aircrew shift south from Incirlik to fly out of Beirut while the US Marines and US Army were deployed there at the behest of [[Camille Chamoun]], the President. VQ-2 operated out of [[Beirut Airport]] through the remainder of the summer and into the fall, departing with the withdrawal of US forces after stabilization in October 1958.\n\n===Homeport Change===\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\nThe relocation of the squadron to Rota began in late 1958 into the first days of 1959. The shift of the squadron CO, XO, and department heads (DHs) was completed by 14 January 1959, but it would take another year to transfer all command assets to Rota<ref name=\"East\" />. All assets at Lyautey had to be surveyed, packed up, and moved. \n\nDuring this evolution, five seven-seat A3D-2Q aircraft arrived to replace the four-seat A3D-1Qs. These new aircraft had the bulkhead between the  cockpit and the bomb bay removed, the bomb bay sealed, and three more seats and equipment added in the former bay.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"East\" />. This unarmed version (the tail gun had been removed<ref name=\"Francillon\" />) brought an increase in capability to the community.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the eleven aircrew fatalities and three aircraft in three mishaps:\n# On 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name='VPNavy'>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Mishaps|url =https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html|website = www.vpnavy.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> lost an engine on approach.

All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\n==1960s==\n\n===Change===\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. On 14 January 1960, with all equipment and personnel out of Lyautey, VQ-2 officially transferred to Naval Station. \n\nThe Navy had recognized that the maintenance costs of the aging, worn P4M-1Q and P2V-5F airframes were increasingly more expensive to maintain, and these planes needed replacement. Washington opted for a larger, more capable aircraft, the [[EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. The \"Willie Victors,\" unarmed like the A3D-2Qs<ref name=\":0\" />, could carry a crew of twenty-six. On 26 February 1960, the first two WV-2Q arrived. By the end of the first quarter in 1960, 31 March, VQ-2'aircraft inventory were five A3D-2Q, three P2V-5F, two P4M-1Q, and two WV-2Q. The P2V-5F and P4M-1Q aircraft were soon to be phased out as all hands quickly adapted to the A3D-2Q and WV-2Q airframes. Meanwhile, the\u00b7squadron continued its business of airborne electronic reconnaissance. By the summer of 1960, the Mercators and Neptunes were gone.\n\nOn 18 September 1962, the Department of Defense (DoD) initiated its Tri-Service Aircraft Designation System which replaced the 1922 USN Aircraft Designation System. The new unified system for designating all US military aircraft was a ''Type/Model/Series'' (T/M/S).<ref name=\"TMS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.info/usmilav/aircraft.html|title=Current Designations of U.S. Military Aircraft|website = www.designation-systems.info|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref>. With this change, the A3D-2Q became the EA-3B and the WV-2Q became the EC-121M<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\n===In Theater Operations===\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs with A3D-2Qs filling in as needed<ref name=\":0\" />. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nFollowing the Cuban Missile Crisis was [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant<ref name=\"East\"/>. Afterwards, a series of eastern Mediterranean crises provided ample opportunities for VQ-2 to perform timely reconnaissance<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />. A major factor in the more direct tactical reconnaissance shipboard role was the rapidly growing and modernizing Soviet Navy that established a continuous presence in the Mediterranean, concurrent with the Cyprus Crisis. In response to these crises, VQ-2 started operating EA-3B detachments aboard a Mediterranean-based carriers like her sister squadron, VQ-1 did in the Pacific. In January of 1965, the first planes went aboard the [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS Saratoga (CVA-60)]]. Detachments aboardupport to the Mediterranean deployed carriers.\n\nWhile operating in Vietnam and the Philippines, the political tensions in the Middle East and North Africa were building. In June of 1967, armed conflict erupted into the [[Six-Day War]] where Israel defeated its enemies. The loss of the [[USS Liberty]] during the war at the hands of the IDF reaffirmed the relative safety of using aircraft for fleet reconnaissance<ref name=\"East\" />. This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cessation of strife in Cyprus. The coup in Libya in 1969 combined with the ever increasing presence of the Soviet Navy to counter the presence of the NATO navies in the Mediterranean kept the command operating at a high tempo.\n\nAs the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe from various NATO bases, from US Sixth Fleet carriers, as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n===Cuban Missile Crisis===\n\nIn October 1962 the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] developed. Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in CONUS<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />, VQ-2 deployed a number of EA-3B and an EC-121M aircraft to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba. After this major superpower crisis was defused, the assets returned to Spain. The squadron's rapidity and flexibility demonstrated in Florida<ref name=\"VQH\" /> kept it very busy when it returned to Europe where it resumed missions in the Mediterranean, Baltic, and central Europe. \n===Vietnam===\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown by EA-3Bs and EC-121Ms into the theater to support US Navy combat operations in Vietnam. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam in 1966, VQ-2 EA-3Bs joined them operating almost exclusively from there as VQ-2 DET BRAVO<ref name=\"East\" />. From both locations, VQ-2 aircraft provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]<ref name=\"East\" />. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the fifty-two aircrew fatalities and five aircraft in seven mishaps.\n# Two days after the official move, on 16 January 1960, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124365) crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]].

Tensions came to a head with the 1973 Yom Kippur War. This tempo lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nOn 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses. In 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US Presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf.

These missions occasionally provoked reactions, sometimes hostile, from behind the Iron Curtain. On April 8, 1950, Soviet [[Lavochkin La-11]] fighters shot down a Lyautey-based PB4Y-2 Privateer (BUNO 59645) over the Baltic Sea, off the coast of Liep\u0101ja, Latvia with the loss of all ten aircrew<ref name=\"StaHypo1\">{{Cite web|title = History Of VQ-2.

As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines. Having lost an aircraft and lives to hostile Soviet action, the aircrew appreciated the added takeoff and combat speed of the two [[Allison J33-A-10A]] turbojet engines mounted in the aft of the [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360-20A Wasp Major]] radial's nacelles<ref name=\"East\">East, Don C.</ref>. \n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A. By mid-1954, four P4M-1Qs and one [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2V-2 Neptune]] were at Lyautey. The P2V-2, stripped of ASW equipment, served as a trainer and logistics aircraft<ref name=\"StaHypo2\">{{Cite web|title = History Of VQ-2.

Regular deployment sites were [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik]], [[RAF Mildenhall|Mildehnall], [[Lucius D.

At commissioning, Commander Morris L. Kalin led a total complement of 24 officers and 78 enlisted men<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant.]]\n[[File:P2V-5 NAS Jacksonville 1952.jpg|thumb|left|P2V-5 with nose turret in 1952. The Lyautey P2V-5Fs had additional turbojets mounted on nacelles where the rockets are in this photo.]]\nThe squadron continued using the six P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. In addition, they obtained three Lockheed P2V-5Fs. The P2V-5Fs were reconfigured onsite from the standard maritime reconnaissance to similar electronic suites as the P-4Ms. Of note, the P2v-5Fs had the same dash speed capability as the P4Ms from two [[Westinghouse J34]]-WE-34 turbojets mounted on their own nacelles outboard the [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone|Wright R-3350-32W Cyclone Turbo-compound]] radials. The squadron used the P2V-3 for pilot training and logistics, since it was not configured for electronic reconnaissance (this became a standard squadron practice when possible; using a \"bare bones airframe of one of its models for training and logistics)<ref name=\"East\" />. The four Neptunes would serve alongside the Mercators until 1960.\n\nIn September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron. The A3D-1Q, nicknamed \"The Whale\" was a reconfigured A3D-1 with the bombay closed and an electronic reconnaissance suite installed similar to those of the P4M-1Q and P2V-5F<ref name=\"Francillon\">Francillon</ref><ref name=\"Heinemann\">Heinemann</ref><ref name=\"Gunston\">Gunston</ref>. The Whale was a carrier-capable high-wing, twin-jet aircraft with a crew of four<ref name= \"Winchester\">Winchester 2006, p. 75.</ref>. The A-3 was also one of the fastest non-afterburner aircraft in the US Armed Forces with a service ceiling significantly higher than the Mercators and Neptunes which gave the aircraft a greater area of coverage<ref name=East\" />. The squadron also received an A3D-1 which it use like the P2V-3<ref name=\"East\" />. Although the pilots and navigators came to the command after carrier-qualifying, the squadron operated the A-3 from land bases until the next decade unlike her sister squadron VQ-1<ref name=\"Hypo2\" /><ref name=\"East\" />. With the high tempo of operations and depot-level maintenance for the three models back in the continental United States (CONUS), it is unsurprising that on 1 June 1957, the command had three P4M-1Q,, two A3D-1Q, two P2V-5F, one A3D-1, and one P2V-3 reported in its table of organization (TOE)<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\nThe [[1958 Lebanon crisis|Lebanon Crisis in 1958]] on 15 July 1958, saw a p4M-1Q and aircrew shift south from Incirlik to fly out of Beirut while the US Marines and US Army were deployed there at the behest of [[Camille Chamoun]], the President. VQ-2 operated out of [[Beirut Airport]] through the remainder of the summer and into the fall, departing with the withdrawal of US forces after stabilization in October 1958.\n\n===Homeport Change===\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\nThe relocation of the squadron to Rota began in late 1958 into the first days of 1959. The shift of the squadron CO, XO, and department heads (DHs) was completed by 14 January 1959, but it would take another year to transfer all command assets to Rota<ref name=\"East\" />. All assets at Lyautey had to be surveyed, packed up, and moved. \n\nDuring this evolution, five seven-seat A3D-2Q aircraft arrived to replace the four-seat A3D-1Qs. These new aircraft had the bulkhead between the  cockpit and the bomb bay removed, the bomb bay sealed, and three more seats and equipment added in the former bay.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"East\" />. This unarmed version (the tail gun had been removed<ref name=\"Francillon\" />) brought an increase in capability to the community.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the eleven aircrew fatalities and three aircraft in three mishaps:\n# On 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name='VPNavy'>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Mishaps|url =https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html|website = www.vpnavy.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> lost an engine on approach.

All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\n==1960s==\n\n===Change===\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. On 14 January 1960, with all equipment and personnel out of Lyautey, VQ-2 officially transferred to Naval Station. \n\nThe Navy had recognized that the maintenance costs of the aging, worn P4M-1Q and P2V-5F airframes were increasingly more expensive to maintain, and these planes needed replacement. Washington opted for a larger, more capable aircraft, the [[EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. The \"Willie Victors,\" unarmed like the A3D-2Qs<ref name=\":0\" />, could carry a crew of twenty-six. On 26 February 1960, the first two WV-2Q arrived. By the end of the first quarter in 1960, 31 March, VQ-2'aircraft inventory were five A3D-2Q, three P2V-5F, two P4M-1Q, and two WV-2Q. The P2V-5F and P4M-1Q aircraft were soon to be phased out as all hands quickly adapted to the A3D-2Q and WV-2Q airframes. Meanwhile, the\u00b7squadron continued its business of airborne electronic reconnaissance. By the summer of 1960, the Mercators and Neptunes were gone.\n\nOn 18 September 1962, the Department of Defense (DoD) initiated its Tri-Service Aircraft Designation System which replaced the 1922 USN Aircraft Designation System. The new unified system for designating all US military aircraft was a ''Type/Model/Series'' (T/M/S).<ref name=\"TMS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.info/usmilav/aircraft.html|title=Current Designations of U.S. Military Aircraft|website = www.designation-systems.info|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref>. With this change, the A3D-2Q became the EA-3B and the WV-2Q became the EC-121M<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\n===In Theater Operations===\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs with A3D-2Qs filling in as needed<ref name=\":0\" />. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nFollowing the Cuban Missile Crisis was [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant<ref name=\"East\"/>. Afterwards, a series of eastern Mediterranean crises provided ample opportunities for VQ-2 to perform timely reconnaissance<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />. A major factor in the more direct tactical reconnaissance shipboard role was the rapidly growing and modernizing Soviet Navy that established a continuous presence in the Mediterranean, concurrent with the Cyprus Crisis. In response to these crises, VQ-2 started operating EA-3B detachments aboard a Mediterranean-based carriers like her sister squadron, VQ-1 did in the Pacific. In January of 1965, the first planes went aboard the [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS Saratoga (CVA-60)]]. Detachments aboardupport to the Mediterranean deployed carriers.\n\nWhile operating in Vietnam and the Philippines, the political tensions in the Middle East and North Africa were building. In June of 1967, armed conflict erupted into the [[Six-Day War]] where Israel defeated its enemies. The loss of the [[USS Liberty]] during the war at the hands of the IDF reaffirmed the relative safety of using aircraft for fleet reconnaissance<ref name=\"East\" />. This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cessation of strife in Cyprus. The coup in Libya in 1969 combined with the ever increasing presence of the Soviet Navy to counter the presence of the NATO navies in the Mediterranean kept the command operating at a high tempo.\n\nAs the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe from various NATO bases, from US Sixth Fleet carriers, as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n===Cuban Missile Crisis===\n\nIn October 1962 the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] developed. Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in CONUS<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />, VQ-2 deployed a number of EA-3B and an EC-121M aircraft to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba. After this major superpower crisis was defused, the assets returned to Spain. The squadron's rapidity and flexibility demonstrated in Florida<ref name=\"VQH\" /> kept it very busy when it returned to Europe where it resumed missions in the Mediterranean, Baltic, and central Europe. \n===Vietnam===\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown by EA-3Bs and EC-121Ms into the theater to support US Navy combat operations in Vietnam. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam in 1966, VQ-2 EA-3Bs joined them operating almost exclusively from there as VQ-2 DET BRAVO<ref name=\"East\" />. From both locations, VQ-2 aircraft provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]<ref name=\"East\" />. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the fifty-two aircrew fatalities and five aircraft in seven mishaps.\n# Two days after the official move, on 16 January 1960, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124365) crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there<ref name=\":0\" />.

To observers on the ground, WV-2Q seemed explode with the tail separating from the main fuselage over [[Markt Schwaben]], 17 km south of Munich Airport. The main fuselage and tail section crashed several hundred yards apart in fields southwest of the town. The aircraft was totally destroyed killing all twenty-two Navy and four Army aircrew.

The aircraft iced up, the engines flamed out, and it stalled into a spin. The pilot ordered the crew to bail out. The four aircrew in the aft compartment bailed. Just as the crew chief was getting ready to go, the pilot got a restart and recovered out of the spin. The aircraft with the pilot, navigator and crew chief made it back to DET ALFA. The other four perished with only one body recovered and the personal effects of the other three.<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /><ref name=\"StaHypo\" />\n# On 3 November 1966, an EA-3B (BUNO 146458)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> struck the water aft of the ship inbound to a night recovery on the [[USS Independence (CV-62)|USS Independence (CVA-62)]] in the central Mediterranean off [[Sicily]]. All six aircrew aboard were lost at sea.\n# Returning from a mission along the East German/Czech border in the during the \"[[Prague Spring]]\" of 1968, an EA-3B was entering the landing pattern at Ramstein AFB when it had a slat malfunction pitching nose-up turn.<ref name=\"East\" />.  With the plane seeming to enter a stall, the pilot signalled for a crew bail out. The four aircrew in the aft compartment bailed but at 1200 feet altitude. Again, just as the crew chief was getting ready to go, the slat suddenly operated allowing a recovery at Ramstein. Although bailing out at a low altitude, the four back end crew survived.<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /><ref name=\"StaHypo\" />\n# On 4 June 1968, an EA-3B (BUNO 142670)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" />, flown by the new (by barely beyond a month)squadron CO, CDR T.E.

The Whale lost an engine just after takeoff descended slowly until hitting the ground on the down slope of a hill cartwheeling into a sugar beet field approximately one mile east of the Rota runway. CDR Daum and three of his department heads who were aboard were killed. The crew chief and another petty officer survived. Two squadron junior officers on their way in to the command were the first people to the crash site.<ref name=\"AvSafety\">{{Cite web|title =Accident Douglas EA-3B Skywarrior 142670, 04 Jun 1968|url =https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/158670|website = aviation-safety.net|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref>\n# In the summer of 1968, a rocket attack on Danang damaged the nose and cockpit of EA-3B (BUNO 144848)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" />. DET BRAVO shipped the airframe to CONUS for repairs via sealift. In rough weather in Tokyo Bay on 14 December 1968, the plane broke loose from its tie downs and was lost overboard.\n\n==1970s==\n[[File:EP-3E Orion of VQ-2 parked c1971.jpg|thumb|EP-3E Aries of VQ-2 parked in 1971]]\nOn 26 February 1970, an EA-3B (BUNO 144851)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> was lost while operating from [[USS Franklin D.

The [[Aircraft catapult|catapult]] system malfunctioned in mid-stroke, also known as a 'cold cat,\" resulting in the Whale \u201cdribbling\u201d off the bow and being run over by the carrier<ref name=\"East\" />. Four of the crew members died in the accident<ref name=\":2\"/>\n\nVQ-2 continued to operate and maintain EC-121M aircraft into 1974. \n\nIn the second decade of the squadron's forward basing in Spain, the American presence in Rota saw the relocation of the destroyer squadron that had been based in Athens arrive just as the submarine squadron returned to CONUS. <ref name=\"East\"/> The greater availability of assignments at the Aviation Intermediate Maintenance Depot (AIMD) across the hangar fro the squadron saw an increase in \"homesteading\" (remaining at one location as long as one's career would allow) by enlisted personnel as the rate of intermarriage with Spanish host nationals increased.\n\nOn 31 July 1971, the squadron received its first delivery of the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries]] aircraft.<ref name=\":0\" /> This relatively newer airframe gave the squadron a more reliable platform due to its commonality with the VP P-3s and the availability of parts.\n\nIncreasing terrorism related to strife in the Middle East and the increasing Libyan radicalization after the 1969 coup led to a continued high operational tempo. Tensions came to a head with the 1973 Yom Kippur War. This tempo lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nOn 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses. In 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US Presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf. VQ-2 shared the manning of carrier and Diego Garcia detachments.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"East\" /> This manning would continue until the third phase of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1982.\n\n==1980s==\n[[File:EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on USS Saratoga (CV-60) c1986.jpg|left|thumb|EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS]] Saratoga inn 1986.]]\nAs VQ-2 entered the mid-1980s, the frenzied pace of operations including [[Operation Mole Cricket 19]](Arab-Israel [[Beqaa Valley|Beqaa]] War), and continuing with 1982 - 1983 [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|Beirut Crisis]] with the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|U.S. Marine barracks bombing]], and the [[United States Sixth Fleet|Sixth Fleet]] December [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|1983 air strike into Lebanon]], allowed little leisure time for the squadron.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nVQ-2 was awarded the [[Navy Expeditionary Medal]] for participation in the Beirut evacuation and operations in the vicinity of [[Libya]] during [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Operation El Dorado Canyon]], 12\u201317 April 1986.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 25 January 1987, an EA-3B crashed on the USS Nimitz killing all seven crew members.\n\n==1990s==\nIn the summer of 1990, the squadron provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of 2000 non-combatant personnel from war-stricken [[Liberia]] in [[operation Sharp Edge]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Lockheed EP-3E Orion (ARIES), USA - Navy AN2094464.jpg|thumb|EP-3E of VQ-2 based at Rota, Spain, seen arriving for [[Royal International Air Tattoo|RIAT]] '92.]]\nFrom August 1990 to April 1991, VQ-2 provided combat reconnaissance during operations [[Gulf War|Desert Shield/Desert Storm]], Proven Force, and [[Operation Provide Comfort|Provide Comfort]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 29 June 1991, the first EP-3E Aries II aircraft arrived in Rota and on 20 September 1991, the squadron retired the EA-3B Skywarrior the same year.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStarting in July 1992, VQ-2 flew support missions with Operations [[Operation Deny Flight|Deny Flight]], Provide Promise, Sharp Guard, Joint Endeavor, Decisive Endeavor, and Deliberate Guard providing combat reconnaissance and intelligence to [[NATO]] and [[United Nations]] forces in the Former [[Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs of 1997, VQ-2 operated four EP-3E Aries II aircraft and two [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3C Orion]] aircraft from its home-base at Rota and two-plane detachment at [[Souda Bay|Naval Support Activity Souda Bay, Crete]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn March 1997, VQ-2 provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of non-combatant personnel from [[Albania]] following unrest from a failed [[Pyramid scheme|pyramid savings scheme]] during [[Operation Silver Wake]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==2000s==\nVQ-2 relocated from NS Rota, Spain, to NAS Whidbey Island, effective 1 September 2005.

They headlined sold-out shows worldwide with everyone from [[Skrillex]] and [[Knife Party]] to [[Steve Aoki]] and [[DJ Snake]]. They also made notable appearances at festivals like [[Electric Daisy Carnival|EDC]], [[Glastonbury Festival]], [[SXSW]], [[Pukkelpop]], [[Winter Music Conference|WMC]], [[Tomorrowland]] and countless others.\n\nOn 19 March they released their first full-length album ''Irreverence'' on [[Dim Mak Records]].

It features notable collaborations with [[Steve Aoki]], [[Foreign Beggars]], and [[Modestep]].\n\n===2015: ''Write Your Future''===\nIn early 2014, Thomas Desbouvrie resigned from the band to pursue his aspirations in Art. Although one member short, the band lost no speed and continued touring at major festivals worldwide. Finding a second wind in the studio, Dirtyphonics released a collaboration with [[Zeds Dead]], ''Where Are You Now'' feat. Bright Lights on [[Mad Decent]]. In February 2015, the band released their sophomore ''Write Your Future'' EP  on [[Dim Mak Records]] including collaborations with UZ, [[12th Planet (musician)|12th Planet]], [[Trinidad James]], Matt Rose and Julie Hardy. The band toured the US and Europe while keeping writing lots of music. Back from tour, the band released ''Anonymous'' in homage of their Drum and Bass roots and as a strong statement of their sound. Quickly after, the ''Write Your Future \u2013 Remixes'' EP came out on [[Dim Mak Records]] with remixes from Habstrakt, [[FuntCase]], High Maintenance and Infuze.

They also made notable appearances at festivals like [[Electric Daisy Carnival|EDC]], [[Glastonbury Festival]], [[SXSW]], [[Pukkelpop]], [[Winter Music Conference|WMC]], [[Tomorrowland]] and countless others.\n\nOn 19 March they released their first full-length album ''Irreverence'' on [[Dim Mak Records]]. The album is a heavy mix of anthemic electro, frenetic drum-step, thrash guitars, and pounding drums. It features notable collaborations with [[Steve Aoki]], [[Foreign Beggars]], and [[Modestep]].\n\n===2015: ''Write Your Future''===\nIn early 2014, Thomas Desbouvrie resigned from the band to pursue his aspirations in Art. Although one member short, the band lost no speed and continued touring at major festivals worldwide. Finding a second wind in the studio, Dirtyphonics released a collaboration with [[Zeds Dead]], ''Where Are You Now'' feat. Bright Lights on [[Mad Decent]]. In February 2015, the band released their sophomore ''Write Your Future'' EP  on [[Dim Mak Records]] including collaborations with UZ, [[12th Planet (musician)|12th Planet]], [[Trinidad James]], Matt Rose and Julie Hardy. The band toured the US and Europe while keeping writing lots of music. Back from tour, the band released ''Anonymous'' in homage of their Drum and Bass roots and as a strong statement of their sound. Quickly after, the ''Write Your Future \u2013 Remixes'' EP came out on [[Dim Mak Records]] with remixes from Habstrakt, [[FuntCase]], High Maintenance and Infuze. On 21 October 2015, the band released \"Hoverboard\", a song they wrote in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hendo 2.0 Hoverboard Goes 'Back to the Future' on Oct. 21|url=http://uk.pcmag.com/consumer-electronics-reviews-ratings/72276/news/hendo-20-hoverboard-goes-back-to-the-future-on-oct-21|website=uk.pcmag.com|accessdate=12 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2018}}\n\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:14em;\"| Title\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:25.5em;\"| Album details\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Irreverence''\n|\n*Released: 19 April 2013\n*Label: [[Dim Mak Records]]\n|}\n\n===Extended plays===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:14em;\"| Title\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:25.5em;\"| Album details\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Vandals''\n|\n*Released: 25 May 2009\n*Label: [[AudioPorn Records]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Teleportation''\n|\n*Released: 14 December 2009\n*Label: [[AudioPorn Records]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Write Your Future''\n|\n*Released: 13 February 2015\n*Label: [[Dim Mak Records]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Night Ride''<br>{{small|(with [[Virtual Riot]] and [[Example (musician)|Example]])}}\n|\n*Released: 10 February 2017\n*Label: [[Buygore]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Vantablack (EP)|Vantablack]]''<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.altpress.com/news/dirtyphonics_sullivan_king_vantablack/ |title=Rockers Dirtyphonics and Sullivan King debut electronic-infused new EP\u2014listen |date=3 November 2017 |website=Alternative Press |language=en-US |access-date=12 June 2019}}</ref><br>{{small|(with Sullivan King)}}\n|\n*Released: 3 November 2017\n*Label: [[Monstercat]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Scars''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://music.apple.com/us/album/scars-ep/1462033654 |title=Scars EP by Dirtyphonics on Apple Music |website=iTunes Store |accessdate=13 June 2019}}</ref>\n|\n*Released: 22 May 2019\n*Label: Disciple Records\n|}\n\n===Singles===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!width=\"40\"|Year\n!Title\n!Label\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"2\"|2008\n|valign=\"top\"|''French F**k''\n| rowspan=\"7\"|[[AudioPorn Records]]\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|''Bonus Level''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"4\"|2009\n|valign=\"top\"|''The Secret''<br>{{small|(featuring Tali)}}\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|''Quarks''\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|''Lottery''\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|''Glow''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |2010\n|valign=\"top\"|''Lost In The Game''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"3\"|2011\n|valign=\"top\"|''Tarantino''\n| rowspan=\"2\"|[[Dim Mak Records]]\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|''Oakwood''\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|''French F**k VIP''\n| rowspan=\"2\"|Self-released\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"2\"|2012\n|valign=\"top\"|''I Need Your Love''\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|''DIRTY''\n|rowspan=\"5\"|[[Dim Mak Records]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"4\"|2013\n|valign=\"top\"|''Walk In The Fire''\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|''No Stopping Us''<br>{{small|(featuring [[Foreign Beggars]])}}\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|''Hanging On Me''\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|''Los Angeles''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2014\n|valign=\"top\"|''Where Are You Now''<br>{{small|(with [[Zeds Dead]]) (featuring [[Heather Bright|Bright Lights]])}}\n|[[Mad Decent]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"3\"|2015\n|valign=\"top\"|''Anonymous''\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Self-released\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|''Hoverboard''\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|''Anonymous VIP''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"2\"|2016\n|valign=\"top\"|''Neckbreaker''<br>{{small|with [[FuntCase]]}}\n|[[Circus Records]]\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|''Holy Sh*t''\n|[[Dim Mak Records]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"2\"|2017\n|valign=\"top\"|''Watch Out''<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/7744302/bassnectar-dirtyphonics-ragga-twins-new-song-watch-out-listen |title='Watch Out' For This New Dirtyphonics, Bassnectar and Ragga Twins Track: Listen |website=Billboard |access-date=12 June 2019}}</ref><br>{{small|(with [[Bassnectar]]) (featuring [[Ragga Twins]])}}\n|rowspan=\"3\"|[[Monstercat]]\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|''Got Your Love''<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.edmtunes.com/2017/07/dirtyphonics-riot-got-your-love/ |title=Dirtyphonics x RIOT -

[[Overseas Minangkabau]] leave their home town to start a career in other Indonesian cities as well as neighbouring countries, and [[Padang food|Padang restaurants]], Minangkabau eating establishments that are ubiquitous in Indonesian cities, spring up. These Padang restaurants have introduced and popularised rendang and other [[Padang food]] dishes across Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and the wider world.\n\n[[Andalas University]] historian, Prof. Gusti Asnan suggests that rendang began to spread across the region when Minangkabau merchants and migrant workers began to trade and migrate to [[Malacca Sultanate|Malacca]] in the 16th century, \"Because the journey through the river waterways in Sumatra took much time, a durable preserved dry rendang is suitable for long journey.\"<ref name=\"urangminang.com\"/> The dried Padang rendang is a durable food, good to consume for weeks, even when left at room temperature.<ref name=\"William Wongso\"/>\n\n==Types==\n[[File:Nasi ramas rendang.JPG|thumb|right|''Nasi ramas padang'', rendang served with [[steamed rice]], [[cassava]] leaf, [[egg]] and ''[[gulai]]'' sauce in [[Surabaya]] \u2013 [[Indonesia]].]]\nIn Minangkabau culinary tradition, there are three recognised stages in cooking meat in spicy coconut milk. The dish which results is categorised according to the liquid content of the cooked coconut milk, which ranges from the most wet and soupy to the most dry: ''[[Gulai]] \u2014 Kalio \u2013 Rendang''.<ref>{{cite web | author=Dian Kelana | title=Gulai, Kalio, atau Rendang? | publisher=Kompasiana | date=17 March 2010 | url=http://wisata.kompasiana.com/jalan-jalan/2010/03/18/gulai-kalio-atau-rendang-96187.html | language=Indonesian | accessdate=14 September 2014 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140914201307/http://wisata.kompasiana.com/jalan-jalan/2010/03/18/gulai-kalio-atau-rendang-96187.html | archivedate=14 September 2014 }}</ref> The ingredients of ''gulai'', ''kalio'' and rendang are almost identical with the exceptions that ''gulai'' usually has less red chilli pepper and more turmeric, while rendang has richer spices.\n\nIf pieces of meat are cooked in spicy coconut milk and the process stopped right when the meat is done and the coconut milk has reached its boiling point, the dish is called ''gulai''. If the process continues until the coconut milk is partly evaporated and the meat has started to brown, the dish is called ''kalio''. For a traditional dry rendang, the process continues hours beyond this, until the liquid has all but completely evaporated and the colour turns to a dark brown, almost black colour. Thus not only liquid content but also colour indicate which type of rendang is involved: ''gulai'' is light yellow, ''kalio'' is brown and rendang is very dark brown. Today, one mostly finds only two simpler categories of rendang: either dry or wet.\n\n===Dried rendang===\nAccording to Minangkabau tradition, their true rendang is the dry one. Rendang is diligently stirred, attended and cooked for hours until the coconut milk evaporated and the meat absorbed the spices. It is still served for special ceremonial occasions or to honour guests. If cooked properly, dried rendang can last for three to four weeks stored in room temperature and still good to consume.<ref name=\"William Wongso\" /> It can even last months stored in a refrigerator, and up to six months if frozen.\n\n===Wet rendang or ''kalio''===\n[[File:Rendang dish closeup.jpg|thumb|right|Most rendang in the Netherlands is actually a ''kalio'' because it still contains some liquid]]\nWet rendang, more accurately identified as ''kalio'', is a type of rendang that is cooked for a shorter period of time and much of the coconut milk liquid has not evaporated. If stored at room temperature, ''kalio'' lasts less than a week.<ref name=\"Lipoeto2001\"/> Kalio usually has a light golden brown colour, paler than dry rendang.\n\n==Variations==\n[[File:Rendang hati.JPG|thumb|right|Beef liver rendang]]\nRendang is made from beef (or occasionally [[beef liver]], [[Chicken (food)|chicken]], [[mutton]], [[domestic buffalo|water buffalo]], [[Duck (food)|duck]], or vegetables like [[jackfruit]] or [[cassava]]). Chicken or duck rendang also contains [[tamarind]] and is usually not cooked for as long as beef rendang.<ref>{{cite book |title=Indonesian Regional Food and Cookery |last=Owen |first=Sri |publisher=Frances Lincoln Ltd |year=1999 |isbn=0-7112-1273-2}}</ref>\n\nThe original Indonesian-Minangkabau rendang has two categories, ''rendang darek'' and ''rendang pesisir''. ''Rendang darek'' (\u2018land rendang\u2019) is an umbrella term for dishes from old regions in mountainous areas of Minangkabau such as [[Batusangkar]], [[Agam Regency|Agam]], [[Limapuluh Koto Regency|Lima Puluh Kota]], [[Payakumbuh]], [[Padang Panjang]] and [[Bukittinggi]]. It mainly consists of beef, offal, poultry products, jackfruit, and many other vegetables and animal products which are found in these places. ''Rendang pesisir'' (\u2018coastal rendang\u2019) is from the coastal regions of Minangkabau such as Pariaman, Padang, Painan and Pasaman. ''Rendang pesisir'' mainly consists of seafood, although it is not unusual for them to incorporate beef or water buffalo meat in their rendang.\n\nIndonesian Rendang variations:<ref name=\"urangminang.com\"/>\n# '''Rendang daging''': meat rendang. The most common rendang is made from beef, but may also be from [[water buffalo]], goat, [[mutton]] or [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]], speciality of [[Padang]].\n# '''Rendang ayam''': chicken rendang, speciality of Batusangkar and Bukittinggi.\n# '''Rendang baluik (rendang belut)''': [[eel]] rendang, speciality of [[Solok]].

Malaysian rendang has several variants, such as the Kelantanese rendang and the Negri Sembilan rendang. Malaysian styles of rendang are typically cooked for shorter periods and use ''[[kerisik]]'' (toasted grated coconut) to thicken the spice,<ref name=\"William Wongso\"/> instead of stirring over a low heat for many hours to evaporate the coconut milk as Indonesian rendang requires. Nonetheless, in Malaysia, the ''rendang Tok'' variant, found in the state of [[Perak]], is a dry one.\n\nIn the Philippines, rendang is most commonly associated with the cuisine of the Muslim [[Maranao people]] of [[Mindanao]]. It differs from the Indonesian versions in the use of the native spice mix ''[[Palapa (condiment)|palapa]]'' as well as the addition of ''[[muscovado]]'' sugar.<ref name=\"Fenix\">{{cite web |last1=Fenix |first1=Micky |title=Kitchens of Mindanao: Durian custard, \u2018piyaparan a manok,\u2019 Tausug \u2018tiyula\u2019 |url=https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/303843/kitchens-mindanao-durian-custard-piyaparan-manok-tausug-tiyula/ |work=Philippine Daily Inquirer |accessdate=20 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Popular Muslim Cuisine and Delicacies in CdeO |url=http://aboutcagayandeoro.com/popular-muslim-cuisine-delicacies-cdeo/ |website=About Cagayan de Oro |accessdate=20 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=How to Cook Beef Rendang of The Maranao People |url=https://lynsojor.wordpress.com/2019/02/17/how-to-cook-beef-rendang-of-the-maranao-people/ |website=Lyn Sojor |accessdate=20 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nOther ethnic groups in Indonesia also have adopted a version of rendang into their daily diet. For example, in Java, the rendang \u2013 aside from the Padang variety sold in Padang restaurants \u2014 tend to be wet, slightly sweeter and less spicy to accommodate Javanese tastes. Through colonial ties the Dutch are also familiar with rendang and often serve the wet ''kalio'' version in the [[Netherlands]] \u2014 usually as part of a ''[[rijsttafel]]''.\n\n==Fusion rendang==\n[[File:7-Eleven Frozen Spaghetti Rendang.JPG|thumb|right|Spaghetti rendang sold in [[7-Eleven]] convenience store, Jakarta.]]\nRendang ''[[bumbu (seasoning)|bumbu]]'' is sometimes used as the base of other [[Fusion cuisine|fusion dishes]].

[[Overseas Minangkabau]] leave their home town to start a career in other Indonesian cities as well as neighbouring countries, and [[Padang food|Padang restaurants]], Minangkabau eating establishments that are ubiquitous in Indonesian cities, spring up. These Padang restaurants have introduced and popularised rendang and other [[Padang food]] dishes across Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and the wider world.\n\n[[Andalas University]] historian, Prof. Gusti Asnan suggests that rendang began to spread across the region when Minangkabau merchants and migrant workers began to trade and migrate to [[Malacca Sultanate|Malacca]] in the 16th century, \"Because the journey through the river waterways in Sumatra took much time, a durable preserved dry rendang is suitable for long journey.\"<ref name=\"urangminang.com\"/> The dried Padang rendang is a durable food, good to consume for weeks, even when left at room temperature.<ref name=\"William Wongso\"/>\n\n==Types==\n[[File:Nasi ramas rendang.JPG|thumb|right|''Nasi ramas padang'', rendang served with [[steamed rice]], [[cassava]] leaf, [[egg]] and ''[[gulai]]'' sauce in [[Surabaya]] \u2013 [[Indonesia]].]]\nIn Minangkabau culinary tradition, there are three recognised stages in cooking meat in spicy coconut milk. The dish which results is categorised according to the liquid content of the cooked coconut milk, which ranges from the most wet and soupy to the most dry: ''[[Gulai]] \u2014 Kalio \u2013 Rendang''.<ref>{{cite web | author=Dian Kelana | title=Gulai, Kalio, atau Rendang? | publisher=Kompasiana | date=17 March 2010 | url=http://wisata.kompasiana.com/jalan-jalan/2010/03/18/gulai-kalio-atau-rendang-96187.html | language=Indonesian | accessdate=14 September 2014 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140914201307/http://wisata.kompasiana.com/jalan-jalan/2010/03/18/gulai-kalio-atau-rendang-96187.html | archivedate=14 September 2014 }}</ref> The ingredients of ''gulai'', ''kalio'' and rendang are almost identical with the exceptions that ''gulai'' usually has less red chilli pepper and more turmeric, while rendang has richer spices.\n\nIf pieces of meat are cooked in spicy coconut milk and the process stopped right when the meat is done and the coconut milk has reached its boiling point, the dish is called ''gulai''. If the process continues until the coconut milk is partly evaporated and the meat has started to brown, the dish is called ''kalio''. For a traditional dry rendang, the process continues hours beyond this, until the liquid has all but completely evaporated and the colour turns to a dark brown, almost black colour. Thus not only liquid content but also colour indicate which type of rendang is involved: ''gulai'' is light yellow, ''kalio'' is brown and rendang is very dark brown. Today, one mostly finds only two simpler categories of rendang: either dry or wet.\n\n===Dried rendang===\nAccording to Minangkabau tradition, their true rendang is the dry one. Rendang is diligently stirred, attended and cooked for hours until the coconut milk evaporated and the meat absorbed the spices. It is still served for special ceremonial occasions or to honour guests. If cooked properly, dried rendang can last for three to four weeks stored in room temperature and still good to consume.<ref name=\"William Wongso\" /> It can even last months stored in a refrigerator, and up to six months if frozen.\n\n===Wet rendang or ''kalio''===\n[[File:Rendang dish closeup.jpg|thumb|right|Most rendang in the Netherlands is actually a ''kalio'' because it still contains some liquid]]\nWet rendang, more accurately identified as ''kalio'', is a type of rendang that is cooked for a shorter period of time and much of the coconut milk liquid has not evaporated. If stored at room temperature, ''kalio'' lasts less than a week.<ref name=\"Lipoeto2001\"/> Kalio usually has a light golden brown colour, paler than dry rendang.\n\n==Variations==\n[[File:Rendang hati.JPG|thumb|right|Beef liver rendang]]\nRendang is made from beef (or occasionally [[beef liver]], [[Chicken (food)|chicken]], [[mutton]], [[domestic buffalo|water buffalo]], [[Duck (food)|duck]], or vegetables like [[jackfruit]] or [[cassava]]). Chicken or duck rendang also contains [[tamarind]] and is usually not cooked for as long as beef rendang.<ref>{{cite book |title=Indonesian Regional Food and Cookery |last=Owen |first=Sri |publisher=Frances Lincoln Ltd |year=1999 |isbn=0-7112-1273-2}}</ref>\n\nThe original Indonesian-Minangkabau rendang has two categories, ''rendang darek'' and ''rendang pesisir''. ''Rendang darek'' (\u2018land rendang\u2019) is an umbrella term for dishes from old regions in mountainous areas of Minangkabau such as [[Batusangkar]], [[Agam Regency|Agam]], [[Limapuluh Koto Regency|Lima Puluh Kota]], [[Payakumbuh]], [[Padang Panjang]] and [[Bukittinggi]]. It mainly consists of beef, offal, poultry products, jackfruit, and many other vegetables and animal products which are found in these places. ''Rendang pesisir'' (\u2018coastal rendang\u2019) is from the coastal regions of Minangkabau such as Pariaman, Padang, Painan and Pasaman. ''Rendang pesisir'' mainly consists of seafood, although it is not unusual for them to incorporate beef or water buffalo meat in their rendang.\n\nIndonesian Rendang variations:<ref name=\"urangminang.com\"/>\n# '''Rendang daging''': meat rendang. The most common rendang is made from beef, but may also be from [[water buffalo]], goat, [[mutton]] or [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]], speciality of [[Padang]].\n# '''Rendang ayam''': chicken rendang, speciality of Batusangkar and Bukittinggi.\n# '''Rendang baluik (rendang belut)''': [[eel]] rendang, speciality of [[Solok]]. In the Solok dialect, it is also called \u2018''randang baluk''\u2019.\n# '''Rendang cubadak (rendang nangka)''': jackfruit rendang, speciality of Payakumbuh.\n# '''Rendang hati''': cow liver rendang, speciality of Minangkabau.\n# '''Rendang itiak (rendang bebek)''': duck rendang, speciality of Bukittinggi.\n# '''Rendang jamur''': mushroom rendang\n# '''Rendang jantung pisang''': [[Banana#Flower|banana blossom]] rendang, speciality of Minangkabau.\n# '''Rendang jariang (rendang jengkol)''': ''[[Archidendron pauciflorum|jengkol]]'' rendang, speciality of Bukittinggi.\n# '''Rendang jo kantang''': beef rendang with baby potatoes, speciality of [[Kapau]].\n# '''Rendang lokan (rendang tiram)''': marsh clam rendang, speciality of coastal Minangkabau regions such as [[Pariaman]], [[Painan]] and [[Pesisir Selatan]].\n# '''Rendang paru''': cow's lung rendang, speciality of Payakumbuh.\n# '''Rendang pucuak ubi (rendang daun singkong)''': cassava leaf rendang, speciality of Minangkabau.\n# '''Rendang runtiah (rendang suir)''': shredded beef or poultry rendang, speciality of Payakumbuh.\n# '''Rendang tahu''': tofu rendang, speciality of Minangkabau.\n# '''Rendang talua (rendang telur)''': egg rendang, speciality of Payakumbuh.\n# '''Rendang tempe''': [[tempeh|''tempe'']] rendang, speciality of Minangkabau.\n# '''Rendang tongkol''': mackerel tuna rendang, speciality of coastal Minangkabau regions.\n\n==In other countries==\nOutside of its native land in Minangkabau, rendang is also known in neighbouring countries such as Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, southern Thailand, and the southern [[Philippines]].<ref name=\"rendang origin and popularity\"/><ref name=\"thomas\">{{cite web |last1=Thomas |first1=Amanda |title=Regional Cuisine of Mindanao |url=https://balay.ph/best-mindanao-cuisine/ |website=Balay.ph |accessdate=20 April 2019}}</ref> Most Malaysian rendang is more like ''kalio'', lighter in colour and taste when compared with its Minangkabau counterpart. Malaysian rendang has several variants, such as the Kelantanese rendang and the Negri Sembilan rendang. Malaysian styles of rendang are typically cooked for shorter periods and use ''[[kerisik]]'' (toasted grated coconut) to thicken the spice,<ref name=\"William Wongso\"/> instead of stirring over a low heat for many hours to evaporate the coconut milk as Indonesian rendang requires. Nonetheless, in Malaysia, the ''rendang Tok'' variant, found in the state of [[Perak]], is a dry one.\n\nIn the Philippines, rendang is most commonly associated with the cuisine of the Muslim [[Maranao people]] of [[Mindanao]]. It differs from the Indonesian versions in the use of the native spice mix ''[[Palapa (condiment)|palapa]]'' as well as the addition of ''[[muscovado]]'' sugar.<ref name=\"Fenix\">{{cite web |last1=Fenix |first1=Micky |title=Kitchens of Mindanao: Durian custard, \u2018piyaparan a manok,\u2019 Tausug \u2018tiyula\u2019 |url=https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/303843/kitchens-mindanao-durian-custard-piyaparan-manok-tausug-tiyula/ |work=Philippine Daily Inquirer |accessdate=20 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Popular Muslim Cuisine and Delicacies in CdeO |url=http://aboutcagayandeoro.com/popular-muslim-cuisine-delicacies-cdeo/ |website=About Cagayan de Oro |accessdate=20 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=How to Cook Beef Rendang of The Maranao People |url=https://lynsojor.wordpress.com/2019/02/17/how-to-cook-beef-rendang-of-the-maranao-people/ |website=Lyn Sojor |accessdate=20 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nOther ethnic groups in Indonesia also have adopted a version of rendang into their daily diet. For example, in Java, the rendang \u2013 aside from the Padang variety sold in Padang restaurants \u2014 tend to be wet, slightly sweeter and less spicy to accommodate Javanese tastes. Through colonial ties the Dutch are also familiar with rendang and often serve the wet ''kalio'' version in the [[Netherlands]] \u2014 usually as part of a ''[[rijsttafel]]''.\n\n==Fusion rendang==\n[[File:7-Eleven Frozen Spaghetti Rendang.JPG|thumb|right|Spaghetti rendang sold in [[7-Eleven]] convenience store, Jakarta.]]\nRendang ''[[bumbu (seasoning)|bumbu]]'' is sometimes used as the base of other [[Fusion cuisine|fusion dishes]]. Some chefs in Indonesian [[sushi]] establishments for example, have developed a Japanese-Indonesian fusion cuisine with recipes for krakatau roll, [[gado-gado]] roll, rendang roll and [[gulai]] ramen.<ref name=\"Suntiang\">{{cite web | title=New: Suntiang, When Padang Marries Japanese Food | url=http://www.culinarybonanza.com/2014/02/suntiang-the-first-padang-japanese-fusion-restaurant.html | date=6 February 2014 |publisher=Culinary Bonanza| accessdate=8 November 2015}}</ref> Several chefs and food industries have experimented with fusing rendang with [[sandwich]]es, [[Hamburger|burger]]s and [[spaghetti]].
