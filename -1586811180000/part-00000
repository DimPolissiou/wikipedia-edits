Major constraints control its practice despite it being legal.<ref name=Ling-Jomo/> Police unofficially tolerate and monitor a limited number of brothels, where the prostitutes are regularly screened for health check-ups; however prostitution outside these brothels also exists such as via social escort agencies that usually adopt an internet website or [[Facebook]] presence. Prostitution outside the informally designated red-light areas operates via three main channels: internet advertising, street solicitation, and [[karaoke box]] and [[massage parlor]] work. The internet-advertised sex workers are based in anonymous hotels, and the profile of each sex worker is available from the internet advertisement. Interested [[Client (prostitution)|clients]] contact the sex worker's agent through [[SMS]], who arranges the timing and gives the hotel address to the client. Sex workers operating via such illegal pimps come primarily from [[Thailand]], [[China]] and [[Philippines]] to Singapore for a short tourist visit, and therefore are not screened for health check-ups. There are also local Singaporean masseurs, therapists, [[call girl]]s or social escorts in the industry working as sex workers on the pretext of being students at a local educational institution such as a [[Institute of technology|polytechnic]], models, working office professionals or ex-[[air stewardess]]es. Some of these say that they are certified therapists. Apart from the usual bilingual [[Chinese Singaporeans|Singaporean Chinese]] that speak [[English language|English]] as well as a mother tongue such as [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], other ethnic races on the island such as [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[Indian people|Indian]] women also work as social escorts often using an [[English name]], alongside Eurasians and Russians. Vietnamese prostitutes in Singapore charge high prices for their services.<ref>{{cite news |last= |first= |date=9 August 2014 |title=More bang for your buck: How new technology is shaking up the oldest business |url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21611074-how-new-technology-shaking-up-oldest-business-more-bang-your-buck |newspaper=The Economist |location= |access-date= }}</ref>\n\nThere are grey areas such as social escorts which do not infringe on the women's charter in Singapore's law.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nApart from these regulated brothels, commercial sex workers can be found in many \"massage\" or \"spa\" establishments.

Major constraints control its practice despite it being legal.<ref name=Ling-Jomo/> Police unofficially tolerate and monitor a limited number of brothels, where the prostitutes are regularly screened for health check-ups; however prostitution outside these brothels also exists such as via social escort agencies that usually adopt an internet website or [[Facebook]] presence. Prostitution outside the informally designated red-light areas operates via three main channels: internet advertising, street solicitation, and [[karaoke box]] and [[massage parlor]] work. The internet-advertised sex workers are based in anonymous hotels, and the profile of each sex worker is available from the internet advertisement. Interested [[Client (prostitution)|clients]] contact the sex worker's agent through [[SMS]], who arranges the timing and gives the hotel address to the client. Sex workers operating via such illegal pimps come primarily from [[Thailand]], [[China]] and [[Philippines]] to Singapore for a short tourist visit, and therefore are not screened for health check-ups. There are also local Singaporean masseurs, therapists, [[call girl]]s or social escorts in the industry working as sex workers on the pretext of being students at a local educational institution such as a [[Institute of technology|polytechnic]], models, working office professionals or ex-[[air stewardess]]es. Some of these say that they are certified therapists. Apart from the usual bilingual [[Chinese Singaporeans|Singaporean Chinese]] that speak [[English language|English]] as well as a mother tongue such as [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], other ethnic races on the island such as [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[Indian people|Indian]] women also work as social escorts often using an [[English name]], alongside Eurasians and Russians.

It educates 1 boy between the ages of 11 and 16 and is a specialist [[Engineering College (English specialist school)|Engineering]] and [[Business and Enterprise College]]. It is one of only three maintained boys' schools in West Sussex, and liaises closely with [[Millais School]], the girls' school in the town. It was formerly an 11{{ndash}}18 [[secondary modern school]], becoming an 11{{ndash}}16 comprehensive in 1976.\n\n== History ==\nThe school began following the separation of the Oxford Road senior school into separate schools for boys and girls in the mid-1940s. The boys' school - then named Horsham Secondary Modern School for Boys - moved to its current campus in Comptons Lane in 1954. In 1958, the girls' school was relocated to a nearby site, and both schools were renamed under the Forest name, leading to the opening of the Forest secondary boys school.<ref name=\"vic\">{{cite journal | author=T.P. Hudson (Ed.)| title=Horsham: Education| journal=A History of the County of Sussex: Bramber Rape (North-Western Part) Including Horsham| year=1986| volume=6| issue=2| pages=198\u2013202| url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=18358}}</ref>\n\nIn 1976, education in the town was reorganised to form three comprehensive schools and a separate [[sixth form college]] in place of the existing [[grammar school|grammar]] and secondary modern structure. The Forest school was reconstituted as an 11{{ndash}}16 boys comprehensive, with sixth form provision moving to [[The College of Richard Collyer]].<ref name=\"vic\"/>\n\nFor a period of time which included 1979{{ndash}}1985, the school was divided into departments or \"Houses\", each its own colour.\n\nBrunel - Art/Design/Metalwork/Woodwork (Pink), \nFaraday - Sciences (Yellow), \nMansion - Languages (Light Blue), \nNewton - Mathematics (Red), \nShelley - English language/Literature (Dark Blue), \nTyler - Humanities (Green)\n\nIn the late '70's and early '80's, the first computers arrived and these were Commodore Pets (2 with 1Kb memory and 1 with 32Kb memory).  These were under the care of the Mathematics department and were later joined by a batch of 16Kb \"Pets\" and a BBC Micro. The Science Department procured a Sinclair ZX80, then a ZX81 as their first computers.\n\nIn 2008, the past Houses (Tudor, Stuart, Lancaster, and York) were disbanded, and new \"communities\" were formed (Dyson, Hawking, Branson and Marconi respectively). The school has introduced a '[[vertical tutoring|Vertical Tutor Group]]' system, which was put into practice in June 2009. \n\n\nThis was edited in September 2019, when Year 11's were removed from Vertical Tutor groups and placed in Year 11-only groups, purportedly to help them revise, although the effectiveness of this move is debatable.\n\nAt the end of 2009 The Forest School Radio was launched. The station was ran by students, and the episodes were downloadable podcasts usually available weekly, however, it has since been discontinued.\n\nIn April 2010 the redesigned school website was launched complete with virtual learning facilities, which are now used mostly for homework and revision material. The website was created by Cleverbox,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cleverbox.co.uk/36/website-showcase |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213183335/http://www.cleverbox.co.uk/36/website-showcase |archivedate=2013-12-13 }}</ref> who also designed other materials for the school, including prospectus designs and van artwork.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cleverbox.co.uk/35/portfolio |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213183619/http://www.cleverbox.co.uk/35/portfolio |archivedate=2013-12-13 }}</ref>\n\nIn March 2018 the Forest Newspaper was founded.\n[[File:Forestboysschool.jpg|thumb|left|Entrance]]\n\nIn July 2018, the school's long serving headteacher, Siobhan Denning, left after 11 years at Forest School, which saw the school go from almost a 'special measures' [[Ofsted]] rating to a 'good' rating. <ref>https://www.wscountytimes.co.uk/news/people/headteacher-who-revolutionised-her-school-says-a-fond-farewell-1-8574287</ref>\n\n== Campus ==\nThe school's current buildings were first opened in 1974, and many of the present buildings date from that time.

Prefects wear the same uniform except for the shirt, where instead of white they wear blue and a thinner-striped community-coloured tie.\n\nSenior Prefects wear a badge stating their role. It is worn on the tie and is the Community colour. Furthermore, the Senior Prefects wear all-black ties, with  logos in their respective community colours. There are 20 Senior Prefects, including the Head Boy and Deputy Head Boy. Head Boy and Deputy Head Boy have an all black tie with a blue stripe along the bottom, also with a badge.\n\nIn 2010, a new summer uniform was introduced which consists of a black polo shirt with the school's logo and community name, instead of the usual white shirt with tie. The uniform returns to normal during the winter.\n\n== Events ==\n* The school hosts events organised by staff and pupils. This includes football matches between the students and the teachers. \n* There is an annual Performance Evening, which is drama, dance, PE, music, and art. \n* In June 2009, an annual event was introduced called 'The FM Factor', a talent show featuring pupils from both Forest and Millais school (hosted at Forest) in which pupils perform dancing, singing, acting, and stand up comedy. In 2009, the contest was won by [[Michael Jackson]] Tribute Group \"The Thrillerz\", who performed a medley of Jacksons hits from the 1980s.\n* In July 2009, three pupils organised and choreographed a 'Teachers got Talent' show featuring musical performances from the staff - and featuring successful acts from the 2009 FM Factor. The event raised \u00a3500 which went towards a local school for children with disabilities. \n* In July 2010 the school collaborated with [[Millais School]] to produce a production of [[Billy Elliot the Musical|'Billy Elliot: The Musical']] in celebration of the shows 5th anniversary in the London West End. It was performed at The Capitol Theatre in Horsham and had three sell-out performances. \n* On the second to last night of the summer term the school held the second FM Factor, the winners being [[Tribal Gaffa Tape]] who performed The Tesco Song.\n* In April 2011 the school put on a production of \"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat\". \n* The school is regular entrants to the [[Rock Challenge UK|UK Rock Challenge]]. Its awards from this include 'Performers Choice' and 'Drugs Awareness Award' in 2009, 'Best Staging' in 2010, and 'Best Backstage Crew' in both 2009 and 2010.\nIn March 2012 the school put on a production of [[We Will Rock You (musical)]] with four performances over three days.\n\n== Charity ==\n* The school raises money for charity with events such as non-uniform days, cake sales, and teacher vs. pupil events. Pupils brought in items from their homes to send to [[Haiti]] after the devastating earthquakes.\n* In November 2013, the school raised \u00a31500 for the [[Typhoon Haiyan|2013 Philippines Disaster]] <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theforestschool.com/49/latest-news/article/72/fantastic-response-to-philippines-disaster-appeal |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213182842/http://www.theforestschool.com/49/latest-news/article/72/fantastic-response-to-philippines-disaster-appeal |archivedate=2013-12-13 }}</ref><ref>https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=586824304699165</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Schools in West Sussex}}\n\n[[Category:Horsham]]\n[[Category:Boys' schools in West Sussex]]\n[[Category:Comprehensive schools in West Sussex]]\n[[Category:Community schools in West Sussex]]\n[[Category:Secondary schools in West Sussex]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2019}}\n{{Infobox school \n| name          = The Forest School\n| image         = Forest School, Horsham Logo.png\n| image_size          =\n| coordinates   = {{coord|51.05948|-0.30672|type:edu_region:GB_dim:100|format=dms|display=inline,title}}\n| motto         = Where Boys Learn Best\n| established   = c. 1944\n| closed        = \n| type          = Boys' [[Comprehensive school|comprehensive]] [[Secondary school|secondary]]\n| religious_affiliation      = \n| president     = \n| head_label    = \n| head          = Mr I Straw<ref name=\"Staff\">{{cite web |title=The Forest School Teaching Staff |url=https://4905753ff3cea231a868-376d75cd2890937de6f542499f88a819.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/forest/uploads/document/Teaching-Staff-010918-1.pdf?ts=1537301401 |accessdate=18 September 2018}}</ref>\n| r_head        = \n| chair_label   = Chair of Governors\n| chair         = Mr C Purvis\n| founder       = \n| specialist    = [[Engineering College (English specialist school)|Engineering College]], [[Business and Enterprise College]]\n| address        = Comptons Lane\n| city          = [[Horsham]]\n| county        = [[West Sussex]]\n| country       = [[England]]\n| postcode      = RH13 5NW\n| local_authority           = [[West Sussex]]\n| ofsted        = yes\n| urn           = 126065\n| staff         = 120\n| enrolment    = 1100\n| gender        = Boys\n| lower_age     = 11\n| upper_age     = 16\n| communities        = Branson (Red), Dyson (Yellow), Hawking (Green), Marconi (Blue)\n| colours       = \n| publication   = \n| free_label_1  = \n| free_1        = \n| free_label_2  = \n| free_2        = \n| free_label_3  = \n| free_3        = \n| website       = http://www.theforestschool.com/\n}}\n\n'''The Forest School''' is a school full of sex slaves |comprehensive]] [[secondary school]] for boys in [[Horsham]], [[West Sussex]], [[England]].

The Forest school was reconstituted as an 11{{ndash}}16 boys comprehensive, with sixth form provision moving to [[The College of Richard Collyer]].<ref name=\"vic\"/>\n\nFor a period of time which included 1979{{ndash}}1985, the school was divided into departments or \"Houses\", each its own colour.\n\nBrunel - Art/Design/Metalwork/Woodwork (Pink), \nFaraday - Sciences (Yellow), \nMansion - Languages (Light Blue), \nNewton - Mathematics (Red), \nShelley - English language/Literature (Dark Blue), \nTyler - Humanities (Green)\n\nIn the late '70's and early '80's, the first computers arrived and these were Commodore Pets (2 with 1Kb memory and 1 with 32Kb memory).  These were under the care of the Mathematics department and were later joined by a batch of 16Kb \"Pets\" and a BBC Micro. The Science Department procured a Sinclair ZX80, then a ZX81 as their first computers.\n\nIn 2008, the past Houses (Tudor, Stuart, Lancaster, and York) were disbanded, and new \"communities\" were formed (Dyson, Hawking, Branson and Marconi respectively). The school has introduced a '[[vertical tutoring|Vertical Tutor Group]]' system, which was put into practice in June 2009. \n\n\nThis was edited in September 2019, when Year 11's were removed from Vertical Tutor groups and placed in Year 11-only groups, purportedly to help them revise, although the effectiveness of this move is debatable.\n\nAt the end of 2009 The Forest School Radio was launched. The station was ran by students, and the episodes were downloadable podcasts usually available weekly, however, it has since been discontinued.\n\nIn April 2010 the redesigned school website was launched complete with virtual learning facilities, which are now used mostly for homework and revision material. The website was created by Cleverbox,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cleverbox.co.uk/36/website-showcase |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213183335/http://www.cleverbox.co.uk/36/website-showcase |archivedate=2013-12-13 }}</ref> who also designed other materials for the school, including prospectus designs and van artwork.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cleverbox.co.uk/35/portfolio |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213183619/http://www.cleverbox.co.uk/35/portfolio |archivedate=2013-12-13 }}</ref>\n\nIn March 2018 the Forest Newspaper was founded.\n[[File:Forestboysschool.jpg|thumb|left|Entrance]]\n\nIn July 2018, the school's long serving headteacher, Siobhan Denning, left after 11 years at Forest School, which saw the school go from almost a 'special measures' [[Ofsted]] rating to a 'good' rating. <ref>https://www.wscountytimes.co.uk/news/people/headteacher-who-revolutionised-her-school-says-a-fond-farewell-1-8574287</ref>\n\n== Campus ==\nThe school's current buildings were first opened in 1974, and many of the present buildings date from that time.

Prefects wear the same uniform except for the shirt, where instead of white they wear blue and a thinner-striped community-coloured tie.\n\nSenior Prefects wear a badge stating their role. It is worn on the tie and is the Community colour. Furthermore, the Senior Prefects wear all-black ties, with  logos in their respective community colours. There are 20 Senior Prefects, including the Head Boy and Deputy Head Boy. Head Boy and Deputy Head Boy have an all black tie with a blue stripe along the bottom, also with a badge.\n\nIn 2010, a new summer uniform was introduced which consists of a black polo shirt with the school's logo and community name, instead of the usual white shirt with tie. The uniform returns to normal during the winter.\n\n== Events ==\n* The school hosts events organised by staff and pupils. This includes football matches between the students and the teachers. \n* There is an annual Performance Evening, which is drama, dance, PE, music, and art. \n* In June 2009, an annual event was introduced called 'The FM Factor', a talent show featuring pupils from both Forest and Millais school (hosted at Forest) in which pupils perform dancing, singing, acting, and stand up comedy. In 2009, the contest was won by [[Michael Jackson]] Tribute Group \"The Thrillerz\", who performed a medley of Jacksons hits from the 1980s.\n* In July 2009, three pupils organised and choreographed a 'Teachers got Talent' show featuring musical performances from the staff - and featuring successful acts from the 2009 FM Factor. The event raised \u00a3500 which went towards a local school for children with disabilities. \n* In July 2010 the school collaborated with [[Millais School]] to produce a production of [[Billy Elliot the Musical|'Billy Elliot: The Musical']] in celebration of the shows 5th anniversary in the London West End. It was performed at The Capitol Theatre in Horsham and had three sell-out performances. \n* On the second to last night of the summer term the school held the second FM Factor, the winners being [[Tribal Gaffa Tape]] who performed The Tesco Song.\n* In April 2011 the school put on a production of \"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat\". \n* The school is regular entrants to the [[Rock Challenge UK|UK Rock Challenge]]. Its awards from this include 'Performers Choice' and 'Drugs Awareness Award' in 2009, 'Best Staging' in 2010, and 'Best Backstage Crew' in both 2009 and 2010.\nIn March 2012 the school put on a production of [[We Will Rock You (musical)]] with four performances over three days.\n\n== Charity ==\n* The school raises money for charity with events such as non-uniform days, cake sales, and teacher vs. pupil events. Pupils brought in items from their homes to send to [[Haiti]] after the devastating earthquakes.\n* In November 2013, the school raised \u00a31500 for the [[Typhoon Haiyan|2013 Philippines Disaster]] <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theforestschool.com/49/latest-news/article/72/fantastic-response-to-philippines-disaster-appeal |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213182842/http://www.theforestschool.com/49/latest-news/article/72/fantastic-response-to-philippines-disaster-appeal |archivedate=2013-12-13 }}</ref><ref>https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=586824304699165</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Schools in West Sussex}}\n\n[[Category:Horsham]]\n[[Category:Boys' schools in West Sussex]]\n[[Category:Comprehensive schools in West Sussex]]\n[[Category:Community schools in West Sussex]]\n[[Category:Secondary schools in West Sussex]]\n", "name_user": "81.157.145.216", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_School,_Horsham"}

Young was imprisoned for refusing to be conscripted.\n\nThe party suffered its first split during this period with John MacCormick leaving the party in 1942, owing to his failure to change the party's policy from supporting all out independence to [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|Home Rule]] at that year's conference in Glasgow. McCormick went on to form the [[Scottish Covenant Association]], a non-partisan political organisation campaigning for the establishment of a devolved Scottish Assembly.\n\nHowever, wartime conditions also enabled the SNP's first parliamentary success at the [[1945 Motherwell by-election|Motherwell by-election]] in 1945, but [[Robert McIntyre]] MP lost the seat at the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|general election]] three months later. The 1950s were characterised by similarly low levels of support, and this made it difficult for the party to advance. Indeed, in most general elections they were unable to put up more than a handful of candidates.\n\nThe 1960s, however, offered more electoral successes, with candidates polling credibly at [[Glasgow Bridgeton by-election, 1961|Glasgow Bridgeton]] in 1961, [[1962 West Lothian by-election|West Lothian]] in 1962 and [[1967 Glasgow Pollok by-election|Glasgow Pollok]] in 1967. Indeed, this foreshadowed [[Winnie Ewing]]'s surprise victory in [[1967 Hamilton by-election|a by-election]] at the previously safe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] seat of [[Hamilton (UK Parliament constituency)|Hamilton]]. This brought the SNP to national prominence, leading to the establishment of the [[Royal Commission on the Constitution (United Kingdom)|Kilbrandon Commission]].\n\n=== Becoming a major force (1970s) ===\n[[File:United Kingdom general election 1974 Oct in Scotland.svg|thumb|In [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974]] the SNP won 11 constituencies, a record that would stand until [[Nicola Sturgeon]] assumed the party's leadership.|350x350px]]\nDespite this breakthrough, the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]] was to prove a disappointment for the party as despite an increase in vote share, Ewing failed to retain her seat in Hamilton. The party did receive some consolation with the capture of the [[Western Isles (UK Parliament constituency)|Western Isles]], making [[Donald Stewart (MP)|Donald Stewart]] the party's only MP. This was to be the case until the [[1973 Glasgow Govan by-election|1973 by-election]] at [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] where a hitherto safe Labour seat was claimed by [[Margo MacDonald]].\n\n1974 was to prove something of an [[annus mirabilis]] for the party as it deployed its highly effective ''[[It's Scotland's oil]]'' campaign.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/4241-dilemmas-of-over-development-scottish-nationalism-and-the-future-of-the-union|title=Dilemmas of Over-Development: Scottish Nationalism and the Future of the Union|website=Versobooks.com|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> The SNP gained 6 seats at the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February general election]] before hitting a high point in the [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October re-run]], polling almost a third of all votes in Scotland and returning 11 MPs to Westminster. Furthermore, during that year's [[1974 Scottish local elections|local elections]] the party claimed overall control of [[Cumbernauld and Kilsyth]]. \n\nThis success was to continue for much of the decade, and at the [[1977 Scottish local elections|1977 district elections]] the SNP saw victories at councils including [[East Kilbride (district)|East Kilbride]] and [[Falkirk Council|Falkirk]] and held the balance of power in [[1977 Glasgow City District Council election|Glasgow]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Faux|first=Ronald|url=|title=Labour lose control of Glasgow|date=4 May 1977|work=The Times, p. 1|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> However, this level of support was not to last and by 1978 Labour revival was evident at three by-elections ([[1978 Glasgow Garscadden by-election|Glasgow Garscadden]], [[1978 Hamilton by-election|Hamilton]] and [[1978 Berwick and East Lothian by-election|Berwick and East Lothian]]) as well as the [[1978 Scottish regional elections|regional elections]].\n\nThis was to culminate when the party experienced a large drop in its support at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]], precipitated by the party [[1979 vote of no confidence in the Callaghan ministry|bringing down]] the incumbent Labour minority government following the controversial failure of that year's [[1979 Scottish devolution referendum|devolution referendum]]. Reduced to just 2 MPs, the successes of October 1974 were not to be surpassed until the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]].\n\n=== Factional divisions and infighting (1980s) ===\n[[File:Scottish National Party 79 Group Logo.svg|left|thumb|112x112px|The [[79 Group]] sought to define the party on the [[Left-wing politics|left]]. ]]\nFollowing this defeat, a period of internal strike occurred within the party, culminating with the formation of two internal groups: the proto-fascist [[Siol nan Gaidheal|Siol nan Gaidhea]]<nowiki/>l<ref>{{Cite book|last=Devine, T. M. (Thomas Martin)|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1004568536|title=The Scottish nation : a modern history|isbn=978-0-7181-9673-8|location=London|oclc=1004568536}}</ref> and left-wing [[79 Group]]. Traditionalists within the party, centred around [[Winnie Ewing]], by this time an [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]], responded by establishing the [[Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland]] which sought to ensure that the primary objective of the SNP was campaigning for independence outwith a traditional left-right orientation, despite the fact that this would have undone the work of figures such as [[William Wolfe]], who developed a clearly [[Social democracy|social democratic]] policy platform throughout the 1970s.\n\nThese events ensured the success of a leadership motion at the party's annual conference of 1982, in [[Ayr]], despite the 79 Group being bolstered by the merger of [[Jim Sillars|Jim Sillars']] [[Scottish Labour Party (1976)|Scottish Labour Party (SLP)]] although this influx of ex-SLP members further shifted the characteristics of the party leftwards. Despite this, traditionalist figure [[Gordon Wilson (Scottish politician)|Gordon Wilson]] remained party leader through the electoral dissapointments of [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]] and [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987]], where he lost his own [[Dundee East (UK Parliament constituency)|Dundee East]] seat won 13 years prior. \n\nThrough this period, Sillars grew influence in the party, developing a clear socio-economic platform including ''Independence in Europe,'' reversing the SNP's previous opposition to membership of the [[European Union|then-EEC]] which had been unsuccessful in a [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|1975 referendum]]. This position was enhanced further by Sillars reclaiming [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] in a [[1988 Glasgow Govan by-election|by-election]] in 1988. \n\nDespite this moderation, the party did not join [[Scottish Labour|Labour]], the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrats]] and the [[Scottish Greens|Greens]] as well as civil society in the [[Scottish Constitutional Convention]] which developed a blueprint for a devolved [[Scottish Parliament]] due to the unwillingness of the convention to discuss independence as a constitutional option.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thetarge.co.uk/article/current-affairs/0165/ex-mp-scotland-in-trouble-if-lax-on-constitution|title=Ex-MP: Scotland \u2018in trouble\u2019 if lax on constitution - The Targe|website=thetarge.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> \n\n=== First Salmond era (1990s) ===\n[[File:Tayside Regional Council 1994.svg|thumb|181x181px|In [[1994 Tayside Regional Council election|1994]] the SNP gained control of [[Tayside]], the only time the party controlled a regional council, albeit without a majority.]]\n[[Alex Salmond]] had been elected MP for [[Banff and Buchan (UK Parliament constituency)|Banff and Buchan]] in 1987, after the re-admittance of 79 Group members, and was able to seize the party leadership after Wilson's resignation in [[1990 Scottish National Party leadership election|1990]] after a contest with [[Margaret Ewing]]. This was a surprise victory as Ewing had the backing of much of the party establishment, including Sillars and then-Party Secretary [[John Swinney]]. The defection of Labour MP [[Dick Douglas]] further evidenced the party's clear left-wing positioning, particularly regarding opposition to the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|poll tax]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-27388579|title=Former MP Dick Douglas dies aged 82|date=2014-05-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-04-05|language=en-GB}}</ref> Despite this, Salmond's leadership was unable to avert a fourth successive general election disappointment in [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]] with the party reduced back from 5 to 3 MPs.\n\nThe mid-90s offered some successes for the party, with [[North East Scotland (European Parliament constituency)|North East Scotland]] being gained at the [[1994 European Parliament election|1994 European elections]] and the party securing a [[1995 Perth and Kinross by-election|by-election]] at [[Perth and Kinross (UK Parliament constituency)|Perth and Kinross]] in 1995 after a near miss at [[1994 Monklands East by-election|Monklands East]] the previous year.\n[[File:Scottish devolution referendum, 1997 Question 1 results.svg|left|thumb|The party was part of the successful [[History of Scottish devolution|devolution]] campaign in [[1997 Scottish devolution referendum|1997]].]]\n1997 offered the party's most successful [[1997 United Kingdom general election|general election]] for 23 years, although in the face of the Labour landslide the party was unable to match either 1974 election.

There are also regular meetings of the National Assembly, which provides a forum for detailed discussion of party policy by party members.\n\nThe party has an active youth wing, the [[Young Scots for Independence]], as well as a student wing, the [[Federation of Student Nationalists]]. There is also an [[SNP Trade Union Group]]. There is an independently owned monthly newspaper, ''[[The Scots Independent]]'', which is highly supportive of the party.\n\nThe SNP's leadership is vested in its National Executive Committee (NEC), which is made up of the party's elected office bearers and six elected members (voted for at conference).

Members of the 79 Group - including future party leader and [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] [[Alex Salmond]] - were expelled from the party. This produced a response in the shape of the [[Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland]] from those who wanted the SNP to remain a \"broad church\", apart from arguments of left vs. right. The 1980s saw the SNP further define itself as a party of the political left, such as campaigning against the introduction of the [[community charge|poll tax]] in Scotland in 1989; one year before the tax was imposed on the rest of the UK.<ref name=\"Lynch\"/>\n\nIdeological tensions inside the SNP are further complicated by arguments between the so-called [[SNP gradualist]]s and [[SNP fundamentalist]]s. In essence, gradualists seek to advance Scotland to independence through further devolution, in a \"step-by-step\" strategy. They tend to be in the moderate left grouping, though much of the [[79 Group]] was gradualist in approach. However, this 79 Group gradualism was as much a reaction against the fundamentalists of the day, many of whom believed the SNP should not take a clear left or right position.<ref name=\"Lynch\"/>\n\n===Economic policies ===\n[[File:Revenue Scotland logo.png|left|thumb|The [[First Sturgeon government|Sturgeon Government]] created [[Revenue Scotland]] in 2015.]]\nWith the SNP's policy base being mostly in the mainstream Western European [[social democracy|social democratic]] tradition, the party is committed to polices such as [[progressive tax|progressive personal taxation]].

Young was imprisoned for refusing to be conscripted.\n\nThe party suffered its first split during this period with John MacCormick leaving the party in 1942, owing to his failure to change the party's policy from supporting all out independence to [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|Home Rule]] at that year's conference in Glasgow. McCormick went on to form the [[Scottish Covenant Association]], a non-partisan political organisation campaigning for the establishment of a devolved Scottish Assembly.\n\nHowever, wartime conditions also enabled the SNP's first parliamentary success at the [[1945 Motherwell by-election|Motherwell by-election]] in 1945, but [[Robert McIntyre]] MP lost the seat at the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|general election]] three months later. The 1950s were characterised by similarly low levels of support, and this made it difficult for the party to advance. Indeed, in most general elections they were unable to put up more than a handful of candidates.\n\nThe 1960s, however, offered more electoral successes, with candidates polling credibly at [[Glasgow Bridgeton by-election, 1961|Glasgow Bridgeton]] in 1961, [[1962 West Lothian by-election|West Lothian]] in 1962 and [[1967 Glasgow Pollok by-election|Glasgow Pollok]] in 1967. Indeed, this foreshadowed [[Winnie Ewing]]'s surprise victory in [[1967 Hamilton by-election|a by-election]] at the previously safe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] seat of [[Hamilton (UK Parliament constituency)|Hamilton]]. This brought the SNP to national prominence, leading to the establishment of the [[Royal Commission on the Constitution (United Kingdom)|Kilbrandon Commission]].\n\n=== Becoming a major force (1970s) ===\n[[File:United Kingdom general election 1974 Oct in Scotland.svg|thumb|In [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974]] the SNP won 11 constituencies, a record that would stand until [[Nicola Sturgeon]] assumed the party's leadership.|350x350px]]\nDespite this breakthrough, the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]] was to prove a disappointment for the party as despite an increase in vote share, Ewing failed to retain her seat in Hamilton. The party did receive some consolation with the capture of the [[Western Isles (UK Parliament constituency)|Western Isles]], making [[Donald Stewart (MP)|Donald Stewart]] the party's only MP. This was to be the case until the [[1973 Glasgow Govan by-election|1973 by-election]] at [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] where a hitherto safe Labour seat was claimed by [[Margo MacDonald]].\n\n1974 was to prove something of an [[annus mirabilis]] for the party as it deployed its highly effective ''[[It's Scotland's oil]]'' campaign.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/4241-dilemmas-of-over-development-scottish-nationalism-and-the-future-of-the-union|title=Dilemmas of Over-Development: Scottish Nationalism and the Future of the Union|website=Versobooks.com|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> The SNP gained 6 seats at the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February general election]] before hitting a high point in the [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October re-run]], polling almost a third of all votes in Scotland and returning 11 MPs to Westminster. Furthermore, during that year's [[1974 Scottish local elections|local elections]] the party claimed overall control of [[Cumbernauld and Kilsyth]]. \n\nThis success was to continue for much of the decade, and at the [[1977 Scottish local elections|1977 district elections]] the SNP saw victories at councils including [[East Kilbride (district)|East Kilbride]] and [[Falkirk Council|Falkirk]] and held the balance of power in [[1977 Glasgow City District Council election|Glasgow]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Faux|first=Ronald|url=|title=Labour lose control of Glasgow|date=4 May 1977|work=The Times, p. 1|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> However, this level of support was not to last and by 1978 Labour revival was evident at three by-elections ([[1978 Glasgow Garscadden by-election|Glasgow Garscadden]], [[1978 Hamilton by-election|Hamilton]] and [[1978 Berwick and East Lothian by-election|Berwick and East Lothian]]) as well as the [[1978 Scottish regional elections|regional elections]].\n\nThis was to culminate when the party experienced a large drop in its support at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]], precipitated by the party [[1979 vote of no confidence in the Callaghan ministry|bringing down]] the incumbent Labour minority government following the controversial failure of that year's [[1979 Scottish devolution referendum|devolution referendum]]. Reduced to just 2 MPs, the successes of October 1974 were not to be surpassed until the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]].\n\n=== Factional divisions and infighting (1980s) ===\n[[File:Scottish National Party 79 Group Logo.svg|left|thumb|112x112px|The [[79 Group]] sought to define the party on the [[Left-wing politics|left]]. ]]\nFollowing this defeat, a period of internal strike occurred within the party, culminating with the formation of two internal groups: the proto-fascist [[Siol nan Gaidheal|Siol nan Gaidhea]]<nowiki/>l<ref>{{Cite book|last=Devine, T. M. (Thomas Martin)|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1004568536|title=The Scottish nation : a modern history|isbn=978-0-7181-9673-8|location=London|oclc=1004568536}}</ref> and left-wing [[79 Group]]. Traditionalists within the party, centred around [[Winnie Ewing]], by this time an [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]], responded by establishing the [[Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland]] which sought to ensure that the primary objective of the SNP was campaigning for independence outwith a traditional left-right orientation, despite the fact that this would have undone the work of figures such as [[William Wolfe]], who developed a clearly [[Social democracy|social democratic]] policy platform throughout the 1970s.\n\nThese events ensured the success of a leadership motion at the party's annual conference of 1982, in [[Ayr]], despite the 79 Group being bolstered by the merger of [[Jim Sillars|Jim Sillars']] [[Scottish Labour Party (1976)|Scottish Labour Party (SLP)]] although this influx of ex-SLP members further shifted the characteristics of the party leftwards. Despite this, traditionalist figure [[Gordon Wilson (Scottish politician)|Gordon Wilson]] remained party leader through the electoral dissapointments of [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]] and [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987]], where he lost his own [[Dundee East (UK Parliament constituency)|Dundee East]] seat won 13 years prior. \n\nThrough this period, Sillars grew influence in the party, developing a clear socio-economic platform including ''Independence in Europe,'' reversing the SNP's previous opposition to membership of the [[European Union|then-EEC]] which had been unsuccessful in a [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|1975 referendum]]. This position was enhanced further by Sillars reclaiming [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] in a [[1988 Glasgow Govan by-election|by-election]] in 1988. \n\nDespite this moderation, the party did not join [[Scottish Labour|Labour]], the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrats]] and the [[Scottish Greens|Greens]] as well as civil society in the [[Scottish Constitutional Convention]] which developed a blueprint for a devolved [[Scottish Parliament]] due to the unwillingness of the convention to discuss independence as a constitutional option.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thetarge.co.uk/article/current-affairs/0165/ex-mp-scotland-in-trouble-if-lax-on-constitution|title=Ex-MP: Scotland \u2018in trouble\u2019 if lax on constitution - The Targe|website=thetarge.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> \n\n=== First Salmond era (1990s) ===\n[[File:Tayside Regional Council 1994.svg|thumb|181x181px|In [[1994 Tayside Regional Council election|1994]] the SNP gained control of [[Tayside]], the only time the party controlled a regional council, albeit without a majority.]]\n[[Alex Salmond]] had been elected MP for [[Banff and Buchan (UK Parliament constituency)|Banff and Buchan]] in 1987, after the re-admittance of 79 Group members, and was able to seize the party leadership after Wilson's resignation in [[1990 Scottish National Party leadership election|1990]] after a contest with [[Margaret Ewing]]. This was a surprise victory as Ewing had the backing of much of the party establishment, including Sillars and then-Party Secretary [[John Swinney]]. The defection of Labour MP [[Dick Douglas]] further evidenced the party's clear left-wing positioning, particularly regarding opposition to the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|poll tax]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-27388579|title=Former MP Dick Douglas dies aged 82|date=2014-05-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-04-05|language=en-GB}}</ref> Despite this, Salmond's leadership was unable to avert a fourth successive general election disappointment in [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]] with the party reduced back from 5 to 3 MPs.\n\nThe mid-90s offered some successes for the party, with [[North East Scotland (European Parliament constituency)|North East Scotland]] being gained at the [[1994 European Parliament election|1994 European elections]] and the party securing a [[1995 Perth and Kinross by-election|by-election]] at [[Perth and Kinross (UK Parliament constituency)|Perth and Kinross]] in 1995 after a near miss at [[1994 Monklands East by-election|Monklands East]] the previous year.\n[[File:Scottish devolution referendum, 1997 Question 1 results.svg|left|thumb|The party was part of the successful [[History of Scottish devolution|devolution]] campaign in [[1997 Scottish devolution referendum|1997]].]]\n1997 offered the party's most successful [[1997 United Kingdom general election|general election]] for 23 years, although in the face of the Labour landslide the party was unable to match either 1974 election.

There is also an [[SNP Trade Union Group]]. There is an independently owned monthly newspaper, ''[[The Scots Independent]]'', which is highly supportive of the party.\n\nThe SNP's leadership is vested in its National Executive Committee (NEC), which is made up of the party's elected office bearers and six elected members (voted for at conference).

Members of the 79 Group - including future party leader and [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] [[Alex Salmond]] - were expelled from the party. This produced a response in the shape of the [[Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland]] from those who wanted the SNP to remain a \"broad church\", apart from arguments of left vs. right.

However, it has been noted such solutions are not unique in general, in violation of [[determinism]], [[unitarity]] and [[linearity]].\n\nThe application of self-consistency to quantum mechanical time machines has taken two main routes. [[Novikov self-consistency principle|Novikov's rule]] applied to the density matrix itself gives the Deutsch prescription. Applied instead to the state vector, the same rule gives nonunitary physics with a dual description in terms of post-selection.\n\n== Deutsch's prescription ==\n{{Dispute about|Deutsch's prescription not involving the many worlds interpretation|date=May 2016}}\nIn 1991, [[David Deutsch]]<ref>{{cite journal\n| last1        = Deutsch\n| first1       = David\n| authorlink1  = David Deutsch\n| date         = 15 Nov 1991\n| title        = Quantum mechanics near closed timelike lines\n| journal      = Physical Review\n| volume       = 44\n| issue        = 10\n| series       = D\n| pages        = 3197\u20133217\n| doi          = 10.1103/PhysRevD.44.3197\n| pmid = 10013776\n|bibcode = 1991PhRvD..44.3197D }}\n</ref> came up with a proposal for the time evolution equations, with special note as to how it resolves the [[grandfather paradox]] and nondeterminism. However, his resolution to the grandfather paradox is considered unsatisfactory to some people, because it states the time traveller reenters another [[Many-worlds interpretation|parallel universe]], and that the actual [[quantum state]] is a [[quantum superposition]] of states where the time traveller does and does not exist.\n\nHe made the simplifying assumption that we can split the quantum system into a subsystem A external to the closed timelike curve, and a CTC part. Also, he assumed that we can combine all the time evolution between the exterior and the CTC into a single [[unitary operator]] ''U''. This presupposes the [[Schr\u00f6dinger picture]]. We have a [[tensor product]] for the combined state of both systems. He makes the further assumption there is no correlation between the initial density state of A and the density state of the CTC. This assumption is not time-symmetric, which he tried to justify by appealing to measurement theory and the second law of thermodynamics. He proposed that the density state restricted to the CTC is a fixed-point of\n:<math>\\rho_{\\text{CTC}} = \\text{Tr}_A \\left[ U \\left( \\rho_A \\otimes \\rho_{\\text{CTC}} \\right) U^\\dagger\\right]</math>.\nHe showed that such [[Renormalization group|fixed points]] always exist. He justified this choice by noting the [[expectation value]] of any CTC observable will match after a loop. However, this could lead to \"multivalued\" histories if memory is preserved around the loop. In particular, his prescription is incompatible with [[path integral formulation|path integrals]] unless we allow for multivalued fields. Another point to note is in general, we have more than one fixed point, and this leads to [[Indeterminism|nondeterminism]] in the time evolution. He suggested the solution use is the one with the [[maximum entropy principle|maximum entropy]]. The final external state is given by <math>\\text{Tr}_{\\text{CTC}} \\left[ U \\left( \\rho_A \\otimes \\rho_{\\text{CTC}} \\right) U^\\dagger\\right]</math>. Pure states can evolve into mixed states.\n\nThis leads to seemingly paradoxical resolutions to the grandfather paradox. Assume the external subsystem is irrelevant, and only a qubit travels in the CTC. Also, assume during the course around the time machine, the value of the qubit is flipped according to the unitary operator\n:<math>U = \\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1\\\\1 & 0\\end{pmatrix}</math>.\nThe most general fixed-point solution is given by\n:<math>\\rho_{\\text{CTC}} = \\begin{pmatrix}\\frac{1}{2} & a\\\\a & \\frac{1}{2}\\end{pmatrix}</math>\nwhere ''a'' is a real number between <math>-1/2</math> and <math>1/2</math>. This is an example of the nonuniqueness of solutions. The solution maximizing the [[von Neumann entropy]] is given by <math>a=0</math>. We can think of this as a mixture (not superposition) between the states <math>\\left( \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle + \\left| 1 \\right\\rangle \\right)/\\sqrt{2}</math> and <math>\\left( \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle - \\left| 1 \\right\\rangle \\right)/\\sqrt{2}</math>. This leads to an interesting interpretation that if the qubit starts off with a value of 0, it will end up with a value of 1, and vice versa, but this should not be problematic according to Deutsch because the qubit ends up in a different parallel universe in the [[many worlds interpretation]].\n\nLater researchers have noted that if his prescription turned out to be right, computers in the vicinity of a time machine can solve [[PSPACE-complete]] problems.<ref>{{cite journal\n| last1        = Aaronson\n| first1       = Scott\n| authorlink1  = Scott Aaronson\n| last2        = Watrous\n| first2       = John\n| authorlink2  = John Watrous (computer scientist)\n|date=Feb 2009\n| title        = Closed Timelike Curves Make Quantum and Classical Computing Equivalent\n| journal      = Proceedings of the Royal Society\n| volume       = 465\n| issue        = 2102\n| series       = A\n| pages        = 631\u2013647\n| arxiv        = 0808.2669\n| bibcode      = 2009RSPSA.465..631A\n| doi          = 10.1098/rspa.2008.0350\n}}</ref>\n\nHowever, it was shown in an article by Tolksdorf and Verch that Deutsch's CTC fixed point condition can be fulfilled to arbitrary precision in any quantum system described according to relativistic [[quantum field theory]] on spacetimes where CTCs are excluded, casting doubts on whether Deutsch's condition is really characteristic of quantum processes mimicking CTCs in the sense of [[general relativity]].<ref>{{cite journal\n| last1        = Tolksdorf\n| first1       = Juergen\n| authorlink1  = \n| last2        = Verch\n| first2       = Rainer\n| authorlink2  = \n|date=2018\n| title        = Quantum physics, fields and closed timelike curves: The D-CTC condition in quantum field theory\n| journal      = Communications in Mathematical Physics\n| volume       = 357\n| issue        = 1\n| series       = \n| pages        = 319\u2013351\n| arxiv        = 1609.01496\n| bibcode      =2018CMaPh.357..319T \n| doi          =  10.1007/s00220-017-2943-5\n}}</ref>\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|study in quantum mechanics}}\nUntil recently, most studies on [[time travel]] are based upon [[classical physics|classical]] [[general relativity]].

This leads to an interesting interpretation that if the qubit starts off with a value of 0, it will end up with a value of 1, and vice versa, but this should not be problematic according to Deutsch because the qubit ends up in a different parallel universe in the [[many worlds interpretation]].\n\nLater researchers have noted that if his prescription turned out to be right, computers in the vicinity of a time machine can solve [[PSPACE-complete]] problems.<ref>{{cite journal\n| last1        = Aaronson\n| first1       = Scott\n| authorlink1  = Scott Aaronson\n| last2        = Watrous\n| first2       = John\n| authorlink2  = John Watrous (computer scientist)\n|date=Feb 2009\n| title        = Closed Timelike Curves Make Quantum and Classical Computing Equivalent\n| journal      = Proceedings of the Royal Society\n| volume       = 465\n| issue        = 2102\n| series       = A\n| pages        = 631\u2013647\n| arxiv        = 0808.2669\n| bibcode      = 2009RSPSA.465..631A\n| doi          = 10.1098/rspa.2008.0350\n}}</ref>\n\nHowever, it was shown in an article by Tolksdorf and Verch that Deutsch's CTC fixed point condition can be fulfilled to arbitrary precision in any quantum system described according to relativistic [[quantum field theory]] on spacetimes where CTCs are excluded, casting doubts on whether Deutsch's condition is really characteristic of quantum processes mimicking CTCs in the sense of [[general relativity]].<ref>{{cite journal\n| last1        = Tolksdorf\n| first1       = Juergen\n| authorlink1  = \n| last2        = Verch\n| first2       = Rainer\n| authorlink2  = \n|date=2018\n| title        = Quantum physics, fields and closed timelike curves: The D-CTC condition in quantum field theory\n| journal      = Communications in Mathematical Physics\n| volume       = 357\n| issue        = 1\n| series       = \n| pages        = 319\u2013351\n| arxiv        = 1609.01496\n| bibcode      =2018CMaPh.357..319T \n| doi          =  10.1007/s00220-017-2943-5\n}}</ref>\n\n== Lloyd's prescription ==\n\nAn alternative proposal was later presented by [[Seth Lloyd]]<ref>{{cite journal\n| last1        = Lloyd\n| first1       = Seth\n| authorlink1  = Seth Lloyd\n| last2        = Maccone\n| first2       = Lorenzo\n| authorlink2  = Lorenzo Maccone\n| last3        = Garcia-Patron\n| first3       = Raul\n| authorlink3  = Raul Garcia-Patron\n| last4        = Giovannetti\n| first4       = Vittorio\n| authorlink4  = Giovannetti Vittorio\n| last5        = Shikano\n| first5       = Yutaka\n| authorlink5  = Yutaka Shikano\n| last6        = Pirandola\n| first6       = Stefano\n| authorlink6  = Stefano Pirandola\n| last7        = Rozema\n| first7       = Lee A.\n| authorlink7  = Lee A.

In particular, the path integral is over single-valued fields, leading to self-consistent histories. He assumed it is ill-defined to speak of the actual density state of the CTC itself, and we should only focus upon the density state outside the CTC. His proposal for the time evolution of the external density state is\n:<math>\\rho_f = \\frac{C\\rho_i C^\\dagger}{\\text{Tr}\\left[ C\\rho_i C^\\dagger\\right]}</math>, where <math>C = \\text{Tr}_{\\text{CTC}}\\left[ U \\right]</math>.\nIf <math>\\text{Tr}\\left[ C\\rho_i C^\\dagger\\right]=0</math>, no solution exists due to [[destructive interference]] in the path integral.

Each time traveling qubit has an associated [[negentropy]], given approximately by the logarithm of the noise of the communication channel. Each use of the time machine can be used to extract as much work from a thermal bath. In a brute force search for a randomly generated password, the entropy of the unknown string can be effectively reduced by a similar amount. Because the negentropy and computational power diverge as the noise term goes to zero, complexity class may not be the best way to describe the capabilities of time machines.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Novikov self-consistency principle]]\n* [[Grandfather paradox]]\n* [[Ontological paradox]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Quantum mechanics topics}}\n{{Time travel}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Quantum Mechanics Of Time Travel}}\n[[Category:Time travel]]\n[[Category:Quantum mechanics]]\n[[Category:Quantum gravity]]\n", "name_user": "24.188.48.103", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(BOIII)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics_of_time_travel"}

He was the [[List of ages of popes|oldest]] pope (reigning until the age of 93), and had the [[List of popes by length of reign|third-longest confirmed pontificate]], behind those of [[Pius IX]] (his immediate predecessor) and [[John Paul II]].\n\nHe is well known for his intellectualism and his attempts to define the position of the Catholic Church with regard to modern thinking. In his famous 1891 encyclical ''[[Rerum novarum]]'', Pope Leo outlined the rights of workers to a fair wage, safe working conditions, and the formation of [[trade unions]], while affirming the rights of property and free enterprise, opposing both [[socialism]] and [[laissez-faire]] [[capitalism]]. He influenced [[Mariology of the Catholic Church]] and promoted both the [[rosary]] and the [[scapular]].\n\nLeo XIII issued a record of eleven papal encyclicals on the [[rosary]] earning him the title as the \"'''Rosary Pope'''\". In addition, he approved two new Marian [[scapular]]s and was the first pope to fully embrace the concept of Mary as [[Mediatrix]]. He was the first pope to have never held any control over the [[Papal States]], after they had been dissolved by 1870. He was briefly buried in the grottos of Saint Peter's Basilica before his remains were later transferred to the [[Basilica of Saint John Lateran]].\n\n== Early life and education, 1810\u20131836 ==\n[[File:Carpineto italiano paolucci.jpg|thumb|left|170px|The house in [[Carpineto Romano]], in which the Pecci brothers grew up]]\nBorn in [[Carpineto Romano]], near Rome, he was the sixth of the seven sons of Count Ludovico Pecci and his wife Anna Prosperi Buzzi. His brothers included [[Giuseppe Pecci|Giuseppe]] and Giovanni Battista Pecci. Until 1818 he lived at home with his family, \"in which religion counted as the highest grace on earth, as through her, salvation can be earned for all eternity\".{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=7}} Together with his brother Giuseppe, he studied in the Jesuit College in [[Viterbo]], where he stayed until 1824.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=12}} He enjoyed the [[Latin]] language and was known to write his own Latin poems at the age of eleven.\n\nIn 1824 he and his older brother Giuseppe were called to Rome where their mother was dying. Count Pecci wanted his children near him after the loss of his wife, and so they stayed with him in Rome, attending the Jesuit [[Collegium Romanum]].\n\nIn 1828, 18-year-old Vincenzo decided in favour of [[secular clergy]], while his brother Giuseppe entered the Jesuit order.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=20}} He studied at the ''[[Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy|Academia dei Nobili]]'', mainly diplomacy and law. In 1834, he gave a student presentation, attended by several [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]], on ''papal judgements''. For his presentation he received awards for academic excellence, and gained the attention of Vatican officials.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=23}} [[Cardinal Secretary of State]] [[Luigi Lambruschini]] introduced him to Vatican congregations. During a cholera epidemic in Rome he assisted [[Giuseppe Antonio Sala|Cardinal Sala]] in his duties as overseer of all the city hospitals.<ref name=Benigni>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09169a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Pope Leo XIII|website=www.newadvent.org}}</ref> In 1836 he received his doctorate in theology and doctorates of civil and [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]] in Rome.\n\n==Provincial administrator, 1837\u20131843==\n[[File:Carpineto romano illustration 1878.jpg|thumb|Illustration of the [[Carpineto Romano]] as seen in 1860]]\nOn 14 February 1837, [[Pope Gregory XVI]] appointed the 27 year old Pecci as personal [[prelate]] even before he was ordained priest on 31 December 1837, by the [[Cardinal Vicar|Vicar of Rome]], [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Carlo Odescalchi]]. He celebrated his first mass together with his priest brother Giuseppe.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=24}} Shortly thereafter, [[Gregory XVI]] appointed Pecci as legate (provincial administrator) to [[Benevento]], the smallest of papal provinces, including about 20,000&nbsp;people.<ref name=Benigni />\n\nThe main problems facing Pecci were a decaying local economy, insecurity because of widespread bandits, and pervasive [[Camorra|Mafia or Camorra]] structures, which were often allied with aristocratic families. Pecci arrested the most powerful aristocrat in Benevento, and his troops captured others, who were either killed or imprisoned by him. With the public order restored, he turned to the economy and a reform of the tax system to stimulate trade with neighboring provinces.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=31}}\n\nPecci was first destined for [[Spoleto]], a province of 100,000. On 17 July 1841, he was sent to [[Perugia]] with 200,000 inhabitants.<ref name=Benigni /> His immediate concern was to prepare the province for a papal visitation in the same year. Pope Gregory XVI visited hospitals and educational institutions for several days, asking for advice and listing questions. The fight against corruption continued in Perugia, where Pecci investigated several incidents. When it was claimed that a bakery was selling bread below the prescribed pound weight, he personally went there, had all bread weighed, and confiscated it if below legal weight. The confiscated bread was distributed to the poor.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=37}}\n\n==Nuncio to Belgium, 1843==\n[[File:Leo13nuncio.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Archbishop Pecci as [[Apostolic Nuncio to Belgium|Nuncio]] in [[Brussels]]]]\nIn 1843, Pecci, only thirty-three years old, was appointed [[Apostolic Nuncio to Belgium]],<ref name=Miranda>[http://www2.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1853-ii.htm#Pecci Miranda, Salvador. \"Pecci, Gioacchino\", ''The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church'']</ref> a position which guaranteed the Cardinal's hat after completion of the tour.\n\nOn 27 April 1843, Pope Gregory XVI appointed Pecci [[Archbishop]] and asked his Cardinal Secretary of State Lambruschini to consecrate him.<ref name=Miranda /> Pecci developed excellent relations with the royal family and used the location to visit neighbouring Germany, where he was particularly interested in the resumed construction of the [[Cologne Cathedral]].\n\nIn 1844, upon his initiative, a [[Belgian college (Rome)|Belgian College]] in Rome was opened, where 102 years later, in 1946, the future [[Pope John Paul II]] would begin his Roman studies. He spent several weeks in England with Bishop [[Nicholas Wiseman]], carefully reviewing the condition of the [[Catholic Church in England#Nineteenth century|Catholic Church in that country]].{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=52}}\n\nIn Belgium, the school question was sharply debated between the Catholic majority and the [[Liberalism|Liberal]] minority. Pecci encouraged the struggle for Catholic schools, yet he was able to win the good will of the Court, not only of the pious [[Louise-Marie of France|Queen Louise]], but also of [[Leopold I of Belgium|King Leopold I]], strongly Liberal in his views. The new nuncio succeeded in uniting the Catholics. At the end of his mission, the King granted him the Grand Cordon in the [[Order of Leopold (Belgium)|Order of Leopold]].<ref>Laatste Nieuws (Het) 1 January 1910</ref>\n\n==Archbishop-Bishop of Perugia, 1846\u20131878==\n\n===Papal assistant===\n[[File:Leo entryperugia.jpg|thumb|Archbishop Pecci enters [[Perugia]] in 1846]]\nIn 1843, Pecci had been named [[Assistant at the Pontifical Throne|papal assistant]]. From 1846 to 1877 he was considered a popular and successful [[Archbishop of Perugia|Archbishop-Bishop of Perugia]]. In 1847, after [[Pope Pius IX]] granted unlimited freedom for the press in the Papal States,<ref>K\u00fchne 62</ref> Pecci, who had been highly popular in the first years of his episcopate, became the object of attacks in the media and at his residence.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=66}} In 1848, [[Revolutions of 1848|revolutionary movements]] developed throughout Western Europe, including France, Germany and Italy. Austrian, French and Spanish troops reversed the revolutionary gains, but at a price for Pecci and the Catholic Church, who could not regain their former popularity.\n\n===Provincial council===\nPecci called a provincial council{{when|date=July 2017}} to reform the religious life in his dioceses. He invested in enlarging the seminary for future priests and in hiring new and prominent professors, preferably [[Thomist]]s. He called on his brother [[Giuseppe Pecci]], a noted Thomist scholar, to resign his professorship in Rome and teach in Perugia instead.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=76}} His own residence was next to the seminary, which facilitated his daily contacts with the students.\n\n===Charitable activities===\n[[File:Leopoor.jpg|thumb|Archbishop Pecci aids the poor in Perugia]]\nPecci developed several activities{{when|date=July 2017}} in support of [[Catholic charities]]. He founded [[homeless shelter]]s for boys, girls and elderly women. Throughout his dioceses he opened branches of a ''Bank, Monte di Piet\u00e0,'' which focused on low-income people and provided [[low-interest loan]]s.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=78}}  He created [[soup kitchen]]s, which were run by the Capuchins. In the consistory of 19 December 1853, he was elevated to the [[College of Cardinals]], as [[Cardinal-Priest]] of ''[[San Crisogono|S. Crisogono]]''.<ref name=Miranda /> In light of continuing earthquakes and floods, he donated all resources for festivities to the victims. Much of the public attention turned on the conflict between the [[Papal States]] and Italian nationalism, aiming at the papal states' annihilation to achieve the [[Unification of Italy]].\n\n===Defending the papacy===\nPecci defended the papacy and its claims. When Italian authorities expropriated convents and monasteries of Catholic orders, turning them into administration or military buildings, Pecci protested but acted moderately. When the Italian state took over Catholic schools, Pecci, fearing for his theological seminary, simply added all secular topics from other schools and opened the seminary to non-theologians.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=102}} The new government also levied taxes on the Church and issued legislation,{{when|date=July 2017}} according to which all Episcopal or papal utterances were to be approved by the government before their publication.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=105}}\n\n===Organizing the First Vatican Council===\nOn 8 December 1869, an [[Catholic Ecumenical Councils|ecumenical council]], which became known as the [[First Vatican Council]], was to take place in the Vatican per Pope Pius IX. Pecci was likely well informed, since the Pope named his brother Giuseppe to help prepare the event.\n\nDuring the 1870s in his last years in Perugia, Pecci addressed the role of the Church in modern society several times, defining the Church as ''the mother of material civilization'', because it upheld human dignity of working people, opposed the excesses of industrialization, and developed large scale charities for the needy.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=129}}\n\nIn August 1877, on the death of Cardinal [[Filippo de Angelis]], Pope Pius IX appointed him [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church|Camerlengo]], which meant he had to reside in Rome.<ref name=Oreilly>[https://archive.org/stream/lifepopeleoxiii00ldgoog#page/n296/mode/2up O'Reilly, Bernard.

It was also debated that the conclave be moved elsewhere, but Pecci decided otherwise. On 18 February 1878 the conclave assembled in Rome.

Leo's intellectual and diplomatic skills helped regain much of the prestige lost with the fall of the Papal States. He tried to reconcile the Church with the working class, particularly by dealing with the social changes that were sweeping Europe. The new economic order had resulted in the growth of an impoverished working class who had increasing anti-clerical and socialist sympathies. Leo helped reverse this trend.\n\nWhile Leo XIII was no radical in either theology or politics, his papacy did move the Catholic Church back to the mainstream of European life. Considered a great diplomat, he managed to improve relations with Russia, Prussia, Germany, France, Britain and other countries.\n\nPope Leo XIII was able to reach several agreements in 1896 that resulted in better conditions for the faithful and additional appointments of bishops. During the [[Fifth cholera pandemic]] in 1891 he ordered the construction of a [[hospice]] inside the Vatican. That building would be torn down in 1996 to make way for construction of the [[Domus Sanctae Marthae]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/HolySee/Interregnum/domus.asp |title=Domus Sanctae Marthae & The New Urns Used in the Election of the Pope |publisher=EWTN |date=22 February 1996 |accessdate=15 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nLeo was a drinker of the [[cocaine]]-infused wine tonic [[Vin Mariani]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Poison Pills: The Untold Story of the Vioxx Drug Scandal|last=Nesi|first=Thomas|date=2008|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books|isbn=9780312369590|edition=1st|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/poisonpillsuntol0000nesi/page/53 53]|oclc=227205792|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/poisonpillsuntol0000nesi/page/53}}</ref> He awarded a [[Vatican City|Vatican]] gold medal to the wine's creator, [[Angelo Mariani (chemist)|Angelo Mariani]] and also appeared on a poster endorsing it.<ref name=inciardi>{{cite book |last=Inciardi |first=James A. |title=The War on Drugs II |publisher=Mayfield Publishing Company |year=1992 |page=6 |isbn=978-1-55934-016-8}}</ref> Leo XIII was a [[Semi-vegetarianism|semi-vegetarian]].

In his first [[papal consistory|consistory]] in 1879, he elevated his older brother, [[Giuseppe Pecci|Giuseppe]], to the cardinalate. He had to defend the freedom of the Church against what Catholics considered Italian persecutions and attacks in the area of education, expropriation and violation of Catholic Churches, legal measures against the Church and brutal attacks, culminating in anticlerical groups attempting to throw the body of the deceased Pope Pius IX into the Tiber river on 13 July 1881.{{Sfn|Schmidlin|1934|p=413}} The Pope even considered moving his residence to [[Trieste]] or [[Salzburg]], two cities in [[Austria]], an idea that the Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]] gently rejected.{{Sfn|Schmidlin|1934|p=414}}\n\n====United Kingdom====\nAmong the activities of Leo XIII that were important for the English-speaking world, he [[Restoration of the Scottish hierarchy|restored the Scottish hierarchy]] in 1878.

In [[British India]], too, Leo established a Catholic hierarchy in 1886, and regulated some long-standing conflicts with the Portuguese authorities.  A Papal Rescript (20 April 1888) condemned the Irish [[Plan of Campaign#Papal Encyclical 1888|Plan of Campaign]] and all clerical involvement in it as well as boycotting, followed in June by the Papal encyclical \"Saepe Nos\"<ref>{{Citation |last=Pecci |first=Vincenzo Gioacchino Raffaele Luigi |author-link=Pope Leo XIII |publisher=New Advent |url=http://www.newadvent.org/library/docs_le13sn.htm |title=S\u00e6pe nos |language=Latin}}.</ref> that was addressed to all the Irish bishops.

Leo XIII issued some 46 [[apostolic letter]]s and [[encyclical]]s dealing with central issues in the areas of marriage and family and state and society. He also wrote two prayers for the [[intercession]] of [[Michael (archangel)|Michael the Archangel]] after allegedly having a vision of Michael and the [[end time]]s,<ref name=queen>{{cite web|url=http://www.thequeenofangels.com/the-angelic-host/archangel-michael/|title=Archangel Michael|publisher=}}</ref> although the story of the alleged vision may be merely [[apocryphal]], as historians note that the story does not appear in any writings of Pope Leo XIII.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.traditionalmass.org/images/articles/Russia-Leonine.pdf |title=Russia and the Leonine Prayers |last=Cekada |first=Rev.

In 1885 he approved the [[Scapular of the Holy Face]], (also known as ''The Veronica'') and elevated the ''Priests of the Holy Face'' to an archconfraternity.<ref>Henry Charles Lea, 2002, ''A History of Auricular Confession and Indulgences in the Latin Church'', Adamant Media Corp. {{ISBN|1-4021-6108-5}} page 506</ref> He also approved the Scapular of [[Our Lady of Good Counsel]] and the [[Scapular of St. Joseph]], both in 1893, and the [[Scapular of the Sacred Heart]] in 1900.<ref>Francis de Zulueta, 2008, ''Early Steps In The Fold'', Miller Press, {{ISBN|978-1-4086-6003-4}} page 317</ref>\n\n====Thomism====\nAs pope, he used all his authority for a revival of [[Thomism]], the theology of [[Thomas Aquinas]]. On 4 August 1879, Leo XIII promulgated the encyclical ''[[Aeterni Patris]]'' (\"Eternal Father\") which, more than any other single document, provided a charter for the revival of Thomism\u2014the medieval theological system based on the thought of Aquinas\u2014as the official philosophical and theological system of the Catholic Church. It was to be normative not only in the training of priests at church seminaries but also in the education of the laity at universities.\n\nFollowing this encyclical Pope Leo XIII created the [[Pontifical Academy of St. Thomas Aquinas]] on 15 October 1879 and ordered the publication of the critical edition, the so-called [[Leonine Edition]], of the complete works of the ''doctor angelicus''. The superintendence of the leonine edition was entrusted to [[Tommaso Maria Zigliara]], professor and rector of the ''Collegium Divi Thomae de Urbe '' the future [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']].  Leo XIII also founded the ''Angelicum's'' Faculty of Philosophy in 1882 and its Faculty of [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]] in 1896.\n\n====Consecrations====\n[[File:Maria Droste zu Vischering.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Blessed [[Mary of the Divine Heart|Sister Mary of the Divine Heart]] was a nun from the [[Congregation of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd]] who requested Pope Leo XIII to consecrate the entire world to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.<ref>{{Citation |last=Chasle |first=Louis |title=Sister Mary of the Divine Heart, Droste zu Vischering, religious of the Good Shepherd, 1863\u20131899 |publisher=Burns & Oates |place=London |year=1906}}.</ref>]]\nPope Leo XIII performed a number of consecrations, at times entering new theological territory. After he received many letters from [[Mary of the Divine Heart|Sister Mary of the Divine Heart]], the countess of [[Droste zu Vischering]] and [[wikt:Special:Search/mother superior|Mother Superior]] in the Convent of the [[Congregation of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd|Good Shepherd Sisters]] in [[Porto]], Portugal, asking him to consecrate the entire world to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, he commissioned a group of theologians to examine the petition on the basis of revelation and sacred tradition. The outcome of this investigation was positive, and so in the encyclical letter ''[[Annum sacrum]]'' (on 25 May 1899) he decreed that the consecration of the entire human race to the Sacred Heart of Jesus should take place on 11 June 1899.\n\nThe encyclical letter also encouraged the entire Catholic episcopate to promote the [[First Friday Devotions]], established June as the Month of the Sacred Heart, and included the [[Prayer of Consecration to the Sacred Heart]].<ref>{{Citation |first=Ann |last=Ball |year=2003 |title=Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices |isbn=978-0-87973-910-2 |page=166}}.</ref> His consecration of the entire world to the [[Sacred Heart of Jesus]] presented theological challenges in consecrating non-Christians. Since about 1850, various congregations and States had consecrated themselves to the Sacred Heart, and, in 1875, this consecration was made throughout the Catholic world.\n\n====Scriptures====\nIn his 1893 encyclical ''[[Providentissimus Deus]],'' he described the importance of scriptures for theological study. It was an important encyclical for Catholic theology and its relation to the Bible, as Pope Pius XII pointed out fifty years later in his encyclical ''Divino Afflante Spiritu''.<ref>{{Citation |title=Divino Afflante Spiritu |at=1\u201312}}.</ref>\n\n====Relations with Eastern Orthodox Churches====\nPope Leo XIII fostered relations of goodwill, particularly towards the churches of the East, who were not in communion with the Apostolic See. He also opposed efforts to Latinize the [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Rite]] Churches, stating that they constitute a most valuable ancient tradition and symbol of the divine unity of the Catholic Church. He expressed this in his encyclical \"Orientalium Dignitas\" of 1894, writing, \"The Churches of the East are worthy of the glory and reverence that they hold throughout the whole of Christendom in virtue of those extremely ancient, singular memorials that they have bequeathed to us.\"\n\n====Theological research====\n[[File:Newmanhenry.jpg|thumb|145px|left|[[John Henry Newman]] was raised into the College of Cardinals by Pope Leo XIII.]]\nLeo XIII is credited with great efforts in the areas of scientific and historical analysis. He opened the [[Vatican Archive]]s and personally fostered a twenty-volume comprehensive scientific study of the Papacy by [[Ludwig von Pastor]], an Austrian historian.<ref>{{Citation |first=Ludwig |last=von Pastor |title=Errinnerungen |year=1950 |language=German}}.</ref>\n\n====Mariology====\n{{Main|Mariology of Pope Leo XIII}}\nHis predecessor, [[Pope Pius IX]], became known as the Pope of the [[Immaculate Conception]] because of the dogmatization in 1854. Leo XIII, in light of his unprecedented promulgation of the [[rosary]] in eleven encyclicals, was called the [[Rosary Pope]]. In eleven encyclicals on the rosary he promulgates Marian devotion. In his encyclical on the fiftieth anniversary of the Dogma of the Immaculate Conception, he stresses her role in the redemption of humanity, mentioning Mary as [[Mediatrix]] and [[Co-Redemptrix]].\n\n====Social teachings====\n{{Main|List of encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII}}\n\n=====Church and state=====\nLeo XIII worked to encourage understanding between the Church and the modern world, though he preferred a cautious view on freedom of thought, stating that it \"is quite unlawful to demand, defend, or to grant unconditional freedom of thought, or speech, of writing or worship, as if these were so many rights given by nature to man\". Leo's social teachings are based on the Catholic premise that God is the Creator of the world and its Ruler. Eternal law commands the natural order to be maintained, and forbids that it be disturbed; men's destiny is far above human things and beyond the earth.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n=====''Rerum novarum''=====\n[[File:Papst Leo XIII.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Portrait by [[Philip de L\u00e1szl\u00f3]], 1900]]\nHis encyclicals changed the Church's relations with temporal authorities, and, in the 1891 encyclical ''[[Rerum novarum]],'' for the first time addressed social inequality and social justice issues with Papal authority, focusing on the rights and duties of capital and labour. He was greatly influenced by [[Wilhelm Emmanuel von Ketteler]], a German bishop who openly propagated siding with the suffering working classes in his book ''Die Arbeiterfrage und das Christentum''. Since Leo XIII, Papal teachings have expanded on the rights and obligations of workers and the limitations of private property: [[Pope Pius XI]] [[Quadragesimo anno]], the [[Social teachings of Pope Pius XII]] on a huge range of social issues, [[John XXIII]] [[Mater et magistra]] in 1961, [[Pope Paul VI]], the encyclical ''[[Populorum progressio]]'' on world development issues, and [[Pope John Paul II]], ''[[Centesimus annus]]'', commemorating the 100th anniversary of ''Rerum novarum''. Leo XIII had argued that both capitalism and communism are flawed. ''Rerum novarum'' introduced the idea of [[subsidiarity (Catholicism)|subsidiarity]], the principle that political and social decisions should be taken at a local level, if possible, rather than by a central authority, into Catholic social thought.  A list of all of Leo's encyclicals can be found in the [[List of Encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII]].\n\n===Canonizations and beatifications===\nLeo XIII canonized the following saints during his pontificate:\n* 8 December 1881: [[Clare of Montefalco]] (d. 1308), [[John Baptist de Rossi]] (1696\u20131764), [[Lawrence of Brindisi]] (d. 1619), and [[Benedict Joseph Labre]] (1748\u201383)\n* 15 January 1888: Seven Holy Founders of the [[Servite Order]], [[Peter Claver]] (1581\u20131654), [[John Berchmans]] (1599\u20131621), and [[Alphonsus Rodriguez]] (1531\u20131617)\n* 27 May 1897: [[Anthony Maria Zaccaria|Antonio Maria Zaccaria]] (1502\u201339) and [[Peter Fourier]] (1565\u20131640)\n* 24 May 1900: [[John Baptist de la Salle]] (1651\u20131719) and [[Rita of Cascia]] (1381\u20131457)\n\nLeo XIII also beatified several of his predecessors: [[Urban II]] (14 July 1881), [[Victor III]] (23 July 1887) and [[Innocent V]] (9 March 1898).

In honor of your Jubilee, permit me to enter Carmel at the age of 15!\"  Leo XIII answered, \"Well, my child, do what the superiors decide.\" Th\u00e9r\u00e8se replied, \"Oh!

He was the [[List of ages of popes|oldest]] pope (reigning until the age of 93), and had the [[List of popes by length of reign|third-longest confirmed pontificate]], behind those of [[Pius IX]] (his immediate predecessor) and [[John Paul II]].\n\nHe is well known for his intellectualism and his attempts to define the position of the Catholic Church with regard to modern thinking. In his famous 1891 encyclical ''[[Rerum novarum]]'', Pope Leo outlined the rights of workers to a fair wage, safe working conditions, and the formation of [[trade unions]], while affirming the rights of property and free enterprise, opposing both [[socialism]] and [[laissez-faire]] [[capitalism]]. He influenced [[Mariology of the Catholic Church]] and promoted both the [[rosary]] and the [[scapular]].\n\nLeo XIII issued a record of eleven papal encyclicals on the [[rosary]] earning him the title as the \"'''Rosary Pope'''\". In addition, he approved two new Marian [[scapular]]s and was the first pope to fully embrace the concept of Mary as [[Mediatrix]]. He was the first pope to have never held any control over the [[Papal States]], after they had been dissolved by 1870. He was briefly buried in the grottos of Saint Peter's Basilica before his remains were later transferred to the [[Basilica of Saint John Lateran]].\n\n== Early life and education, 1810\u20131836 ==\n[[File:Carpineto italiano paolucci.jpg|thumb|left|170px|The house in [[Carpineto Romano]], in which the Pecci brothers grew up]]\nBorn in [[Carpineto Romano]], near Rome, he was the sixth of the seven sons of Count Ludovico Pecci and his wife Anna Prosperi Buzzi. His brothers included [[Giuseppe Pecci|Giuseppe]] and Giovanni Battista Pecci. Until 1818 he lived at home with his family, \"in which religion counted as the highest grace on earth, as through her, salvation can be earned for all eternity\".{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=7}} Together with his brother Giuseppe, he studied in the Jesuit College in [[Viterbo]], where he stayed until 1824.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=12}} He enjoyed the [[Latin]] language and was known to write his own Latin poems at the age of eleven.\n\nIn 1824 he and his older brother Giuseppe were called to Rome where their mother was dying. Count Pecci wanted his children near him after the loss of his wife, and so they stayed with him in Rome, attending the Jesuit [[Collegium Romanum]].\n\nIn 1828, 18-year-old Vincenzo decided in favour of [[secular clergy]], while his brother Giuseppe entered the Jesuit order.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=20}} He studied at the ''[[Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy|Academia dei Nobili]]'', mainly diplomacy and law. In 1834, he gave a student presentation, attended by several [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]], on ''papal judgements''. For his presentation he received awards for academic excellence, and gained the attention of Vatican officials.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=23}} [[Cardinal Secretary of State]] [[Luigi Lambruschini]] introduced him to Vatican congregations. During a cholera epidemic in Rome he assisted [[Giuseppe Antonio Sala|Cardinal Sala]] in his duties as overseer of all the city hospitals.<ref name=Benigni>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09169a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Pope Leo XIII|website=www.newadvent.org}}</ref> In 1836 he received his doctorate in theology and doctorates of civil and [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]] in Rome.\n\n==Provincial administrator, 1837\u20131843==\n[[File:Carpineto romano illustration 1878.jpg|thumb|Illustration of the [[Carpineto Romano]] as seen in 1860]]\nOn 14 February 1837, [[Pope Gregory XVI]] appointed the 27 year old Pecci as personal [[prelate]] even before he was ordained priest on 31 December 1837, by the [[Cardinal Vicar|Vicar of Rome]], [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Carlo Odescalchi]]. He celebrated his first mass together with his priest brother Giuseppe.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=24}} Shortly thereafter, [[Gregory XVI]] appointed Pecci as legate (provincial administrator) to [[Benevento]], the smallest of papal provinces, including about 20,000&nbsp;people.<ref name=Benigni />\n\nThe main problems facing Pecci were a decaying local economy, insecurity because of widespread bandits, and pervasive [[Camorra|Mafia or Camorra]] structures, which were often allied with aristocratic families. Pecci arrested the most powerful aristocrat in Benevento, and his troops captured others, who were either killed or imprisoned by him. With the public order restored, he turned to the economy and a reform of the tax system to stimulate trade with neighboring provinces.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=31}}\n\nPecci was first destined for [[Spoleto]], a province of 100,000. On 17 July 1841, he was sent to [[Perugia]] with 200,000 inhabitants.<ref name=Benigni /> His immediate concern was to prepare the province for a papal visitation in the same year. Pope Gregory XVI visited hospitals and educational institutions for several days, asking for advice and listing questions. The fight against corruption continued in Perugia, where Pecci investigated several incidents. When it was claimed that a bakery was selling bread below the prescribed pound weight, he personally went there, had all bread weighed, and confiscated it if below legal weight. The confiscated bread was distributed to the poor.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=37}}\n\n==Nuncio to Belgium, 1843==\n[[File:Leo13nuncio.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Archbishop Pecci as [[Apostolic Nuncio to Belgium|Nuncio]] in [[Brussels]]]]\nIn 1843, Pecci, only thirty-three years old, was appointed [[Apostolic Nuncio to Belgium]],<ref name=Miranda>[http://www2.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1853-ii.htm#Pecci Miranda, Salvador. \"Pecci, Gioacchino\", ''The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church'']</ref> a position which guaranteed the Cardinal's hat after completion of the tour.\n\nOn 27 April 1843, Pope Gregory XVI appointed Pecci [[Archbishop]] and asked his Cardinal Secretary of State Lambruschini to consecrate him.<ref name=Miranda /> Pecci developed excellent relations with the royal family and used the location to visit neighbouring Germany, where he was particularly interested in the resumed construction of the [[Cologne Cathedral]].\n\nIn 1844, upon his initiative, a [[Belgian college (Rome)|Belgian College]] in Rome was opened, where 102 years later, in 1946, the future [[Pope John Paul II]] would begin his Roman studies. He spent several weeks in England with Bishop [[Nicholas Wiseman]], carefully reviewing the condition of the [[Catholic Church in England#Nineteenth century|Catholic Church in that country]].{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=52}}\n\nIn Belgium, the school question was sharply debated between the Catholic majority and the [[Liberalism|Liberal]] minority. Pecci encouraged the struggle for Catholic schools, yet he was able to win the good will of the Court, not only of the pious [[Louise-Marie of France|Queen Louise]], but also of [[Leopold I of Belgium|King Leopold I]], strongly Liberal in his views. The new nuncio succeeded in uniting the Catholics. At the end of his mission, the King granted him the Grand Cordon in the [[Order of Leopold (Belgium)|Order of Leopold]].<ref>Laatste Nieuws (Het) 1 January 1910</ref>\n\n==Archbishop-Bishop of Perugia, 1846\u20131878==\n\n===Papal assistant===\n[[File:Leo entryperugia.jpg|thumb|Archbishop Pecci enters [[Perugia]] in 1846]]\nIn 1843, Pecci had been named [[Assistant at the Pontifical Throne|papal assistant]]. From 1846 to 1877 he was considered a popular and successful [[Archbishop of Perugia|Archbishop-Bishop of Perugia]]. In 1847, after [[Pope Pius IX]] granted unlimited freedom for the press in the Papal States,<ref>K\u00fchne 62</ref> Pecci, who had been highly popular in the first years of his episcopate, became the object of attacks in the media and at his residence.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=66}} In 1848, [[Revolutions of 1848|revolutionary movements]] developed throughout Western Europe, including France, Germany and Italy. Austrian, French and Spanish troops reversed the revolutionary gains, but at a price for Pecci and the Catholic Church, who could not regain their former popularity.\n\n===Provincial council===\nPecci called a provincial council{{when|date=July 2017}} to reform the religious life in his dioceses. He invested in enlarging the seminary for future priests and in hiring new and prominent professors, preferably [[Thomist]]s. He called on his brother [[Giuseppe Pecci]], a noted Thomist scholar, to resign his professorship in Rome and teach in Perugia instead.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=76}} His own residence was next to the seminary, which facilitated his daily contacts with the students.\n\n===Charitable activities===\n[[File:Leopoor.jpg|thumb|Archbishop Pecci aids the poor in Perugia]]\nPecci developed several activities{{when|date=July 2017}} in support of [[Catholic charities]]. He founded [[homeless shelter]]s for boys, girls and elderly women. Throughout his dioceses he opened branches of a ''Bank, Monte di Piet\u00e0,'' which focused on low-income people and provided [[low-interest loan]]s.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=78}}  He created [[soup kitchen]]s, which were run by the Capuchins. In the consistory of 19 December 1853, he was elevated to the [[College of Cardinals]], as [[Cardinal-Priest]] of ''[[San Crisogono|S. Crisogono]]''.<ref name=Miranda /> In light of continuing earthquakes and floods, he donated all resources for festivities to the victims. Much of the public attention turned on the conflict between the [[Papal States]] and Italian nationalism, aiming at the papal states' annihilation to achieve the [[Unification of Italy]].\n\n===Defending the papacy===\nPecci defended the papacy and its claims. When Italian authorities expropriated convents and monasteries of Catholic orders, turning them into administration or military buildings, Pecci protested but acted moderately. When the Italian state took over Catholic schools, Pecci, fearing for his theological seminary, simply added all secular topics from other schools and opened the seminary to non-theologians.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=102}} The new government also levied taxes on the Church and issued legislation,{{when|date=July 2017}} according to which all Episcopal or papal utterances were to be approved by the government before their publication.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=105}}\n\n===Organizing the First Vatican Council===\nOn 8 December 1869, an [[Catholic Ecumenical Councils|ecumenical council]], which became known as the [[First Vatican Council]], was to take place in the Vatican per Pope Pius IX. Pecci was likely well informed, since the Pope named his brother Giuseppe to help prepare the event.\n\nDuring the 1870s in his last years in Perugia, Pecci addressed the role of the Church in modern society several times, defining the Church as ''the mother of material civilization'', because it upheld human dignity of working people, opposed the excesses of industrialization, and developed large scale charities for the needy.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=129}}\n\nIn August 1877, on the death of Cardinal [[Filippo de Angelis]], Pope Pius IX appointed him [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church|Camerlengo]], which meant he had to reside in Rome.<ref name=Oreilly>[https://archive.org/stream/lifepopeleoxiii00ldgoog#page/n296/mode/2up O'Reilly, Bernard.

Leo's intellectual and diplomatic skills helped regain much of the prestige lost with the fall of the Papal States. He tried to reconcile the Church with the working class, particularly by dealing with the social changes that were sweeping Europe. The new economic order had resulted in the growth of an impoverished working class who had increasing anti-clerical and socialist sympathies. Leo helped reverse this trend.\n\nWhile Leo XIII was no radical in either theology or politics, his papacy did move the Catholic Church back to the mainstream of European life. Considered a great diplomat, he managed to improve relations with Russia, Prussia, Germany, France, Britain and other countries.\n\nPope Leo XIII was able to reach several agreements in 1896 that resulted in better conditions for the faithful and additional appointments of bishops. During the [[Fifth cholera pandemic]] in 1891 he ordered the construction of a [[hospice]] inside the Vatican.

In his first [[papal consistory|consistory]] in 1879, he elevated his older brother, [[Giuseppe Pecci|Giuseppe]], to the cardinalate. He had to defend the freedom of the Church against what Catholics considered Italian persecutions and attacks in the area of education, expropriation and violation of Catholic Churches, legal measures against the Church and brutal attacks, culminating in anticlerical groups attempting to throw the body of the deceased Pope Pius IX into the Tiber river on 13 July 1881.{{Sfn|Schmidlin|1934|p=413}} The Pope even considered moving his residence to [[Trieste]] or [[Salzburg]], two cities in [[Austria]], an idea that the Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]] gently rejected.{{Sfn|Schmidlin|1934|p=414}}\n\n====United Kingdom====\nAmong the activities of Leo XIII that were important for the English-speaking world, he [[Restoration of the Scottish hierarchy|restored the Scottish hierarchy]] in 1878.

In [[British India]], too, Leo established a Catholic hierarchy in 1886, and regulated some long-standing conflicts with the Portuguese authorities.  A Papal Rescript (20 April 1888) condemned the Irish [[Plan of Campaign#Papal Encyclical 1888|Plan of Campaign]] and all clerical involvement in it as well as boycotting, followed in June by the Papal encyclical \"Saepe Nos\"<ref>{{Citation |last=Pecci |first=Vincenzo Gioacchino Raffaele Luigi |author-link=Pope Leo XIII |publisher=New Advent |url=http://www.newadvent.org/library/docs_le13sn.htm |title=S\u00e6pe nos |language=Latin}}.</ref> that was addressed to all the Irish bishops.

Leo XIII issued some 46 [[apostolic letter]]s and [[encyclical]]s dealing with central issues in the areas of marriage and family and state and society. He also wrote two prayers for the [[intercession]] of [[Michael (archangel)|Michael the Archangel]] after allegedly having a vision of Michael and the [[end time]]s,<ref name=queen>{{cite web|url=http://www.thequeenofangels.com/the-angelic-host/archangel-michael/|title=Archangel Michael|publisher=}}</ref> although the story of the alleged vision may be merely [[apocryphal]], as historians note that the story does not appear in any writings of Pope Leo XIII.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.traditionalmass.org/images/articles/Russia-Leonine.pdf |title=Russia and the Leonine Prayers |last=Cekada |first=Rev.

In 1885 he approved the [[Scapular of the Holy Face]], (also known as ''The Veronica'') and elevated the ''Priests of the Holy Face'' to an archconfraternity.<ref>Henry Charles Lea, 2002, ''A History of Auricular Confession and Indulgences in the Latin Church'', Adamant Media Corp. {{ISBN|1-4021-6108-5}} page 506</ref> He also approved the Scapular of [[Our Lady of Good Counsel]] and the [[Scapular of St. Joseph]], both in 1893, and the [[Scapular of the Sacred Heart]] in 1900.<ref>Francis de Zulueta, 2008, ''Early Steps In The Fold'', Miller Press, {{ISBN|978-1-4086-6003-4}} page 317</ref>\n\n====Thomism====\nAs pope, he used all his authority for a revival of [[Thomism]], the theology of [[Thomas Aquinas]]. On 4 August 1879, Leo XIII promulgated the encyclical ''[[Aeterni Patris]]'' (\"Eternal Father\") which, more than any other single document, provided a charter for the revival of Thomism\u2014the medieval theological system based on the thought of Aquinas\u2014as the official philosophical and theological system of the Catholic Church. It was to be normative not only in the training of priests at church seminaries but also in the education of the laity at universities.\n\nFollowing this encyclical Pope Leo XIII created the [[Pontifical Academy of St. Thomas Aquinas]] on 15 October 1879 and ordered the publication of the critical edition, the so-called [[Leonine Edition]], of the complete works of the ''doctor angelicus''. The superintendence of the leonine edition was entrusted to [[Tommaso Maria Zigliara]], professor and rector of the ''Collegium Divi Thomae de Urbe '' the future [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']].  Leo XIII also founded the ''Angelicum's'' Faculty of Philosophy in 1882 and its Faculty of [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]] in 1896.\n\n====Consecrations====\n[[File:Maria Droste zu Vischering.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Blessed [[Mary of the Divine Heart|Sister Mary of the Divine Heart]] was a nun from the [[Congregation of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd]] who requested Pope Leo XIII to consecrate the entire world to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.<ref>{{Citation |last=Chasle |first=Louis |title=Sister Mary of the Divine Heart, Droste zu Vischering, religious of the Good Shepherd, 1863\u20131899 |publisher=Burns & Oates |place=London |year=1906}}.</ref>]]\nPope Leo XIII performed a number of consecrations, at times entering new theological territory. After he received many letters from [[Mary of the Divine Heart|Sister Mary of the Divine Heart]], the countess of [[Droste zu Vischering]] and [[wikt:Special:Search/mother superior|Mother Superior]] in the Convent of the [[Congregation of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd|Good Shepherd Sisters]] in [[Porto]], Portugal, asking him to consecrate the entire world to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, he commissioned a group of theologians to examine the petition on the basis of revelation and sacred tradition. The outcome of this investigation was positive, and so in the encyclical letter ''[[Annum sacrum]]'' (on 25 May 1899) he decreed that the consecration of the entire human race to the Sacred Heart of Jesus should take place on 11 June 1899.\n\nThe encyclical letter also encouraged the entire Catholic episcopate to promote the [[First Friday Devotions]], established June as the Month of the Sacred Heart, and included the [[Prayer of Consecration to the Sacred Heart]].<ref>{{Citation |first=Ann |last=Ball |year=2003 |title=Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices |isbn=978-0-87973-910-2 |page=166}}.</ref> His consecration of the entire world to the [[Sacred Heart of Jesus]] presented theological challenges in consecrating non-Christians. Since about 1850, various congregations and States had consecrated themselves to the Sacred Heart, and, in 1875, this consecration was made throughout the Catholic world.\n\n====Scriptures====\nIn his 1893 encyclical ''[[Providentissimus Deus]],'' he described the importance of scriptures for theological study. It was an important encyclical for Catholic theology and its relation to the Bible, as Pope Pius XII pointed out fifty years later in his encyclical ''Divino Afflante Spiritu''.<ref>{{Citation |title=Divino Afflante Spiritu |at=1\u201312}}.</ref>\n\n====Relations with Eastern Orthodox Churches====\nPope Leo XIII fostered relations of goodwill, particularly towards the churches of the East, who were not in communion with the Apostolic See. He also opposed efforts to Latinize the [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Rite]] Churches, stating that they constitute a most valuable ancient tradition and symbol of the divine unity of the Catholic Church. He expressed this in his encyclical \"Orientalium Dignitas\" of 1894, writing, \"The Churches of the East are worthy of the glory and reverence that they hold throughout the whole of Christendom in virtue of those extremely ancient, singular memorials that they have bequeathed to us.\"\n\n====Theological research====\n[[File:Newmanhenry.jpg|thumb|145px|left|[[John Henry Newman]] was raised into the College of Cardinals by Pope Leo XIII.]]\nLeo XIII is credited with great efforts in the areas of scientific and historical analysis. He opened the [[Vatican Archive]]s and personally fostered a twenty-volume comprehensive scientific study of the Papacy by [[Ludwig von Pastor]], an Austrian historian.<ref>{{Citation |first=Ludwig |last=von Pastor |title=Errinnerungen |year=1950 |language=German}}.</ref>\n\n====Mariology====\n{{Main|Mariology of Pope Leo XIII}}\nHis predecessor, [[Pope Pius IX]], became known as the Pope of the [[Immaculate Conception]] because of the dogmatization in 1854. Leo XIII, in light of his unprecedented promulgation of the [[rosary]] in eleven encyclicals, was called the [[Rosary Pope]]. In eleven encyclicals on the rosary he promulgates Marian devotion. In his encyclical on the fiftieth anniversary of the Dogma of the Immaculate Conception, he stresses her role in the redemption of humanity, mentioning Mary as [[Mediatrix]] and [[Co-Redemptrix]].\n\n====Social teachings====\n{{Main|List of encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII}}\n\n=====Church and state=====\nLeo XIII worked to encourage understanding between the Church and the modern world, though he preferred a cautious view on freedom of thought, stating that it \"is quite unlawful to demand, defend, or to grant unconditional freedom of thought, or speech, of writing or worship, as if these were so many rights given by nature to man\". Leo's social teachings are based on the Catholic premise that God is the Creator of the world and its Ruler. Eternal law commands the natural order to be maintained, and forbids that it be disturbed; men's destiny is far above human things and beyond the earth.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n=====''Rerum novarum''=====\n[[File:Papst Leo XIII.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Portrait by [[Philip de L\u00e1szl\u00f3]], 1900]]\nHis encyclicals changed the Church's relations with temporal authorities, and, in the 1891 encyclical ''[[Rerum novarum]],'' for the first time addressed social inequality and social justice issues with Papal authority, focusing on the rights and duties of capital and labour. He was greatly influenced by [[Wilhelm Emmanuel von Ketteler]], a German bishop who openly propagated siding with the suffering working classes in his book ''Die Arbeiterfrage und das Christentum''. Since Leo XIII, Papal teachings have expanded on the rights and obligations of workers and the limitations of private property: [[Pope Pius XI]] [[Quadragesimo anno]], the [[Social teachings of Pope Pius XII]] on a huge range of social issues, [[John XXIII]] [[Mater et magistra]] in 1961, [[Pope Paul VI]], the encyclical ''[[Populorum progressio]]'' on world development issues, and [[Pope John Paul II]], ''[[Centesimus annus]]'', commemorating the 100th anniversary of ''Rerum novarum''. Leo XIII had argued that both capitalism and communism are flawed. ''Rerum novarum'' introduced the idea of [[subsidiarity (Catholicism)|subsidiarity]], the principle that political and social decisions should be taken at a local level, if possible, rather than by a central authority, into Catholic social thought.  A list of all of Leo's encyclicals can be found in the [[List of Encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII]].\n\n===Canonizations and beatifications===\nLeo XIII canonized the following saints during his pontificate:\n* 8 December 1881: [[Clare of Montefalco]] (d. 1308), [[John Baptist de Rossi]] (1696\u20131764), [[Lawrence of Brindisi]] (d. 1619), and [[Benedict Joseph Labre]] (1748\u201383)\n* 15 January 1888: Seven Holy Founders of the [[Servite Order]], [[Peter Claver]] (1581\u20131654), [[John Berchmans]] (1599\u20131621), and [[Alphonsus Rodriguez]] (1531\u20131617)\n* 27 May 1897: [[Anthony Maria Zaccaria|Antonio Maria Zaccaria]] (1502\u201339) and [[Peter Fourier]] (1565\u20131640)\n* 24 May 1900: [[John Baptist de la Salle]] (1651\u20131719) and [[Rita of Cascia]] (1381\u20131457)\n\nLeo XIII also beatified several of his predecessors: [[Urban II]] (14 July 1881), [[Victor III]] (23 July 1887) and [[Innocent V]] (9 March 1898).

Even though she was strictly forbidden to speak to him because she was told it would prolong the audience too much, in her autobiography, ''Story of a Soul'', she wrote that after she kissed his slipper and he presented his hand, instead of kissing it, she took it in her own hand and said through tears, \"Most Holy Father, I have a great favor to ask you.  In honor of your Jubilee, permit me to enter Carmel at the age of 15!\"  Leo XIII answered, \"Well, my child, do what the superiors decide.\" Th\u00e9r\u00e8se replied, \"Oh! Holy Father, if you say yes, everybody will agree!\" Finally, the Pope said, \"Go... go... ''You will enter if God wills it''\" [italics hers] after which time two guards lifted Th\u00e9r\u00e8se (still on her knees in front of the Pope) by her arms and carried her to the door where a third gave her a medal of the Pope. Shortly thereafter, the [[Bishop of Bayeux]] authorized the prioress to receive Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, and in April 1888, she entered Carmel at the age of 15.\n\n==Death==\n[[File:TOMB LEO xiii.jpg|thumb|180px|right|The monument and tomb to Leo XIII in the Basilica of Saint John Lateran.]]\nLeo XIII was the first pope to be born in the 19th century and was also the first to die in the 20th century: he lived to the age of 93, dying on 20 July 1903,<ref>John-Peter Pham, ''Heirs of the Fisherman: Behind the Scenes of Papal Death and Succession'', (Oxford University Press, 2004), 98.</ref> the longest-lived pope ever ({{as of|2020|lc=y}}).

The aphids' impact is especially important on vegetable crops such as courgette, melon, cucumber, aubergine and strawberry and on cotton, citrus and mallow.<ref name=\"DAISIE\"/>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q2557995}}\n\n[[Category:Aphis]]\n[[Category:Agricultural pest insects]]\n[[Category:Insects described in 1877]]\n[[Category:Hemiptera of Africa]]\n", "name_user": "Polinizador", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphis_gossypii"}

{"title_page": "Copper Basin (Tennessee)", "text_new": "{{Other uses|Copper Basin (disambiguation){{!}}Copper Basin}}\n{{short description|Geological area in southeastern Tennessee, United States}}\nThe '''Copper Basin''', also known as the '''Ducktown Basin''', is a [[geology|geological]] region located primarily in [[Polk County, Tennessee]] that contains deposits of [[copper]] ore and covers approximately 60,000 acres. Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the nearby landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south. The basin has an average elevation of {{convert|1,650|ft|m}} above sea level.<ref name=ross95>Ross 1935, p. 95-96</ref><ref>Emmons, Laney 1926, p. 13</ref>\n\nThe [[Ocoee River]] flows through the southwestern section of the Copper Basin, entering from Georgia, where it is known as the Toccoa, and exiting via a scenic gorge between Big Frog Mountain and Little Frog Mountain to the west. The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.<ref name=ross95/>\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]]. The city of [[Copperhill, Tennessee|Copperhill]] is located on the southern portion of the basin near the Tennessee-Georgia border, and directly borders [[McCaysville, Georgia]]. Other communities include Postelle in the northwest section of the basin, Isabella in the eastern portion, and Harbuck, [[Turtletown, Tennessee|Turtletown]], and [[Farner, Tennessee|Farner]] just north of the basin.<ref>{{cite map |author = Tennessee Department of Transportation Long Range Planning Division Office of Data Visualization|title = Polk County|year = 2018|url =https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/tdot/maps/county-maps-(us-shields)/o-w/Polk%20County.pdf|publisher = [[Tennessee Department of Transportation]]}}</ref> The Copper Basin is also included in the [[Cleveland metropolitan area, Tennessee|Cleveland, Tennessee metropolitan area]].<ref>{{cite press release|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=OMB Designates 49 New Metropolitan Statistical Areas|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/assets/OMB/pubpress/2003-18.pdf|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=[[Executive branch of the United States government]]|agency=[[Office of Management and Budget]]|date=June 6, 2003|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>\n\nMost of the rocks in the Copper Basin are [[metamorphic rock]]s deposited during the [[Cambrian|Lower Cambrian period]], but also include some [[igneous rock]]s.

In 1876, the companies began importing logs from Fannin County, Georgia. The smelting process released [[sulfur]] gas, which reacted with [[water vapor]] in the atmosphere, forming [[sulfuric acid]] and precipitating as [[acid rain]]. This subsequently killed the majority of the vegetation in the basin, and [[Stormwater runoff|ran off]] into the Ocoee River and surrounding tributaries, killing most aquatic life. Due to the removal of the forests, this also resulted in erosion of the topsoil, much of which ended up in the Ocoee River.<ref name=gms/> The reddish-brown landscape that resulted, which consisted mostly of iron and copper ore, was often compared to the surface of [[Mars]], and was distinctly visible from space.<ref>{{cite news|last=Benton|first=Ben|date=2020-01-01|title=Copper Basin restoration work earns engineering award|url=https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/local/story/2020/jan/01/copper-basin-work-engineering-award/511930/|work=[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]]|location=Chattanooga, Tennessee|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> A total of 32,000 acres were affected.<ref name=tva>{{cite web|url=https://www.tva.gov/Environment/Environmental-Stewardship/Land-Management/The-Greening-of-Copper-Basin|title=The Greening of Copper Basin|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=tva.gov|publisher=Tennessee Valley Authority|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref>\n\nThe state of Georgia began suing the Tennessee Copper Company in the mid 1880s, claiming that the mining operations were causing damage to forests and crops in northern Georgia.

Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the nearby landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south.

The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.<ref name=ross95/>\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]]. The city of [[Copperhill, Tennessee|Copperhill]] is located on the southern portion of the basin near the Tennessee-Georgia border, and directly borders [[McCaysville, Georgia]].

In 1876, the companies began importing logs from Fannin County, Georgia. The smelting process released [[sulfur]] gas, which reacted with [[water vapor]] in the atmosphere, forming [[sulfuric acid]] and precipitating as [[acid rain]]. This subsequently killed the majority of the vegetation in the basin, and [[Stormwater runoff|ran off]] into the Ocoee River and surrounding tributaries, killing most aquatic life. Due to the removal of the forests, this also resulted in erosion of the topsoil, much of which ended up in the Ocoee River.<ref name=gms/> The reddish-brown landscape that resulted, which consisted mostly of iron and copper ore, was often compared to the surface of [[Mars]], and was distinctly visible from space.<ref>{{cite news|last=Benton|first=Ben|date=2020-01-01|title=Copper Basin restoration work earns engineering award|url=https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/local/story/2020/jan/01/copper-basin-work-engineering-award/511930/|work=[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]]|location=Chattanooga, Tennessee|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> A total of 32,000 acres were affected.<ref name=tva>{{cite web|url=https://www.tva.gov/Environment/Environmental-Stewardship/Land-Management/The-Greening-of-Copper-Basin|title=The Greening of Copper Basin|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=tva.gov|publisher=Tennessee Valley Authority|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref>\n\nThe state of Georgia began suing the Tennessee Copper Company in the mid 1880s, claiming that the mining operations were causing damage to forests and crops in northern Georgia.
