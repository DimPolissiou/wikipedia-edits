In fact, everything becomes meaningful with their opposite; e.g. if there is no cold we never understand what heat is. So sin is that which hurts us. When God says \"Do not\", He means \"do not hurt yourself\". An Islamic principle related to ''haram'' is that if something is prohibited or forbidden, then anything that leads to it is also considered a ''haram act''. A similar principle is that the sin of ''haram'' is not limited to the person who engages in the prohibited activity, but the sin also extends to others who support the person in the activity, whether it be material or moral support.<ref>{{cite book|last=Al-Qardawi|first=Yusuf|title=The Lawful and the Prohibited in Islam|year=1999|publisher=American Trust Publications|page=22}}</ref>\n\nThe five categories of {{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0623\u062d\u0643\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0645\u0633\u0629}} [[Ahkam|''al-\u02beA\u1e25k\u0101m al-\u1e34amsa'']] or the hierarchy of acts from permitted to non-permitted are:<ref name=\"Adamec 2009 102\"/><ref>{{cite book|last=Gibb|first=H.

Examples include money earned through cheating, stealing, corruption, murder and Interest or any means that involves harm to another human being. Also, a deal or sale during Friday's prayers [[Jumu'ah|salat al-jumu'ah]]. It is prohibited in Islam for a Muslim to profit from such haram actions. Any believer who benefits from or lives off wealth obtained through haram is a [[sin]]ner.\n#* Prayer in a house taken illegally.\n\nThe religious term ''haram'', based on the [[Quran]], is applied to:\n* Actions, such as cursing, fornication, murder and disrespecting your parents.\n* Policies, such as [[riba]] (usury, interest).\n* Certain food and drink, such as pork and alcohol.\n* Some \u1e25al\u0101l objects, foods or actions that are normally halal but under some conditions become haram. For example, halal food and drinks at noon-time during [[Ramadan]], or a cow or another halal animal that is not slaughtered in the Islamic way and in the name of Allah (God).\n* Certain inaction, such as abandoning the [[salah]].\n\n== Culture ==\nLinguistically, the root of the term haram [compare Ancient Hebrew ''[[Herem (priestly gift)|herem]]'', meaning 'devoted to God', 'forbidden for profane use'] is used to form a wide range of other terms that have legal implications, such as ''hariim'' (a harem) and ''ihraam'' (a state of purity).  In addition, the same word ''(haram)'' is used in the Quran to denote the sacred nature of the Ka'ba and the areas of Mecca, Medina, and Jerusalem.<ref>{{cite journal|last=McAuliffe|first=Jane Dammen|title=Forbidden|journal=Encyclopaedia of the Qur'an|date=2001|volume=2|pages=224\u2013225}}</ref>  This category of sacred, holy, and inviolable also includes spouses and university campuses.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Al Jallad|first=Nader|title=The concepts of al-haram in the Arab-Muslim culture: a translational and lexicographical study|journal=Language Design|year=2008|volume=10|page=80|url=http://elies.rediris.es/Language_Design/LD10/LD_10_02_Nader_Pazeado.pdf}}</ref> As such, the legal use of the root \u062d-\u0631-\u0645 is based on an idea of boundaries between the profane and the sacred, as opposed to prohibitions, as is normally assumed.\n\nColloquially, the word ''haram'' takes on different meanings and operates more closely as a dichotomy with ''[[halal]]'', which denotes the permissible.  In Arabic-speaking countries, saying \"''haram''\" can mean 'what a shame' or 'what a pity' (this meaning has been adopted by [[Modern Hebrew]] [[slang]] as well, and is alike to the Italian use of ''[[sin|peccato]]''). The term can be used formally as a method for chastising strangers who behave inappropriately, or between friends as a form of teasing. The word is also used to instruct children in how to behave by telling them that harming other children or animals is ''haram'', among other things.\n\nThe binary concepts of halal and haram are used in a number of cultural phrases, most notably ''ibn'' (boy) ''al-halal'' and ''bint'' (girl) ''al-halal''.  These phrases are often used to refer to appropriate spouses in marriage, and stand in contrast to ''ibn al-haram'' or ''bint al-haram,'' which are used as insults.  In this case, the term ''haram'' is used to mean ill-mannered or indecent, instead of strictly meaning 'unlawful'.  Halal and haram are also used in regards to money ''(mal)''.  ''Mal al-haram'' means ill-gotten money, and brings destruction on those who make their living through such means.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Al Jallad|first=Nader|title=The concepts of ''al-halal'' and ''al-haram'' in the Arab-Muslim culture: a translational and lexicographical study|journal=Language Design|year=2008|volume=10|pages=81\u201384}}</ref>\n\nThese cultural interpretations of what is haram influence and are influenced by the legal definitions used at the local level.  This means that popular conceptions of haram are partly based on formal Islamic Jurisprudence and partly on regional culture, and the popular conceptions in turn change how the legal system defines and punishes haram actions.<ref>{{cite book|last=Nanji|first=Azim A, editor|title=The Muslim Almanac: A Reference Work on the History, Faith, Culture, and Peoples of Islam|year=1996|publisher=Gale Research Inc.|location=Detroit|page=273}}</ref>\n\n==Forbidden categories of action==\n\n===Food and intoxicants===\nIn Islam, prohibitions on illegal acts or objects are observed by Muslims in accordance to their obedience to the Quranic commands.<ref>{{cite book|last=Siddiqui|first=Mona|title=The Good Muslim|year=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=88}}</ref> In Islamic law, dietary prohibitions are said to help with the understanding of divine will.\n\nRegarding haram meat, Muslims are prohibited from consuming flowing [[blood as food|blood]].

In fact, everything becomes meaningful with their opposite; e.g. if there is no cold we never understand what heat is. So sin is that which hurts us. When God says \"Do not\", He means \"do not hurt yourself\". An Islamic principle related to ''haram'' is that if something is prohibited or forbidden, then anything that leads to it is also considered a ''haram act''. A similar principle is that the sin of ''haram'' is not limited to the person who engages in the prohibited activity, but the sin also extends to others who support the person in the activity, whether it be material or moral support.<ref>{{cite book|last=Al-Qardawi|first=Yusuf|title=The Lawful and the Prohibited in Islam|year=1999|publisher=American Trust Publications|page=22}}</ref>\n\nThe five categories of {{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0623\u062d\u0643\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0645\u0633\u0629}} [[Ahkam|''al-\u02beA\u1e25k\u0101m al-\u1e34amsa'']] or the hierarchy of acts from permitted to non-permitted are:<ref name=\"Adamec 2009 102\"/><ref>{{cite book|last=Gibb|first=H.

Examples include money earned through cheating, stealing, corruption, murder and Interest or any means that involves harm to another human being. Also, a deal or sale during Friday's prayers [[Jumu'ah|salat al-jumu'ah]]. It is prohibited in Islam for a Muslim to profit from such haram actions. Any believer who benefits from or lives off wealth obtained through haram is a [[sin]]ner.\n#* Prayer in a house taken illegally.\n\nThe religious term ''haram'', based on the [[Quran]], is applied to:\n* Actions, such as cursing, fornication, murder and disrespecting your parents.\n* Policies, such as [[riba]] (usury, interest).\n* Certain food and drink, such as pork and alcohol.\n* Some \u1e25al\u0101l objects, foods or actions that are normally halal but under some conditions become haram. For example, halal food and drinks at noon-time during [[Ramadan]], or a cow or another halal animal that is not slaughtered in the Islamic way and in the name of Allah (God).\n* Certain inaction, such as abandoning the [[salah]].\n\n== Culture ==\nLinguistically, the root of the term haram [compare Ancient Hebrew ''[[Herem (priestly gift)|herem]]'', meaning 'devoted to God', 'forbidden for profane use'] is used to form a wide range of other terms that have legal implications, such as ''hariim'' (a harem) and ''ihraam'' (a state of purity).  In addition, the same word ''(haram)'' is used in the Quran to denote the sacred nature of the Ka'ba and the areas of Mecca, Medina, and Jerusalem.<ref>{{cite journal|last=McAuliffe|first=Jane Dammen|title=Forbidden|journal=Encyclopaedia of the Qur'an|date=2001|volume=2|pages=224\u2013225}}</ref>  This category of sacred, holy, and inviolable also includes spouses and university campuses.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Al Jallad|first=Nader|title=The concepts of al-haram in the Arab-Muslim culture: a translational and lexicographical study|journal=Language Design|year=2008|volume=10|page=80|url=http://elies.rediris.es/Language_Design/LD10/LD_10_02_Nader_Pazeado.pdf}}</ref> As such, the legal use of the root \u062d-\u0631-\u0645 is based on an idea of boundaries between the profane and the sacred, as opposed to prohibitions, as is normally assumed.\n\nColloquially, the word ''haram'' takes on different meanings and operates more closely as a dichotomy with ''[[halal]]'', which denotes the permissible.  In Arabic-speaking countries, saying \"''haram''\" can mean 'what a shame' or 'what a pity' (this meaning has been adopted by [[Modern Hebrew]] [[slang]] as well, and is alike to the Italian use of ''[[sin|peccato]]''). The term can be used formally as a method for chastising strangers who behave inappropriately, or between friends as a form of teasing. The word is also used to instruct children in how to behave by telling them that harming other children or animals is ''haram'', among other things.\n\nThe binary concepts of halal and haram are used in a number of cultural phrases, most notably ''ibn'' (boy) ''al-halal'' and ''bint'' (girl) ''al-halal''.  These phrases are often used to refer to appropriate spouses in marriage, and stand in contrast to ''ibn al-haram'' or ''bint al-haram,'' which are used as insults.  In this case, the term ''haram'' is used to mean ill-mannered or indecent, instead of strictly meaning 'unlawful'.  Halal and haram are also used in regards to money ''(mal)''.  ''Mal al-haram'' means ill-gotten money, and brings destruction on those who make their living through such means.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Al Jallad|first=Nader|title=The concepts of ''al-halal'' and ''al-haram'' in the Arab-Muslim culture: a translational and lexicographical study|journal=Language Design|year=2008|volume=10|pages=81\u201384}}</ref>\n\nThese cultural interpretations of what is haram influence and are influenced by the legal definitions used at the local level.  This means that popular conceptions of haram are partly based on formal Islamic Jurisprudence and partly on regional culture, and the popular conceptions in turn change how the legal system defines and punishes haram actions.<ref>{{cite book|last=Nanji|first=Azim A, editor|title=The Muslim Almanac: A Reference Work on the History, Faith, Culture, and Peoples of Islam|year=1996|publisher=Gale Research Inc.|location=Detroit|page=273}}</ref>\n\n==Forbidden categories of action==\n\n===Food and intoxicants===\nIn Islam, prohibitions on illegal acts or objects are observed by Muslims in accordance to their obedience to the Quranic commands.<ref>{{cite book|last=Siddiqui|first=Mona|title=The Good Muslim|year=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=88}}</ref> In Islamic law, dietary prohibitions are said to help with the understanding of divine will.\n\nRegarding haram meat, Muslims are prohibited from consuming flowing [[blood as food|blood]].
