They are the first installments in the eighth generation of the [[Pok\u00e9mon (video game series)|''Pok\u00e9mon'' video game series]] and the second in the series, after [[Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!|''Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu!'' and ''Let's Go, Eevee!'']], to be released on a [[home game console]]. Originally teased at [[E3 2017]] and announced in February 2019, ''Pok\u00e9mon Sword'' and ''Shield'' were released on November 15, 2019.\n\n''Sword'' and ''Shield''{{'s}} concept planning began immediately following the completion of [[Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon|''Pok\u00e9mon Sun'' and ''Moon'']] in 2016, while full production began a year later in September 2017. Like previous installments, they chronicle the journey of a young Pok\u00e9mon trainer aiming to become the Pok\u00e9mon Champion, this time in the new Galar region, which is based on the [[United Kingdom]]. The main objective of the games is to dethrone the Pok\u00e9mon League Champion, Leon, in a tournament that various other Gym Leaders and rivals also take part in, whilst dealing with Team Yell and a nefarious conspiracy within the League. ''Sword'' and ''Shield'' introduce [[List of generation VIII Pok\u00e9mon|81 new Pok\u00e9mon]] alongside [[List of generation VIII Pok\u00e9mon#Galarian Forms|13 regional variants]] of pre-existing Pok\u00e9mon; Dynamaxing, which increases the size of Pok\u00e9mon under certain conditions; Gigantamaxing, which additionally changes the form of certain Pok\u00e9mon; and the Wild Area, which is a large, open-world area with free camera movement that contains co-op raid battles. The two games also reintroduce features previously seen in ''Sun'' and ''Moon'' and ''Let's Go, Pikachu!'' and ''Let's Go, Eevee!'', such as regional variants and roaming Pok\u00e9mon depicted in the overworld. The games will receive two [[expansion pack]]s in 2020, ''The Isle of Armor'' and ''The Crown Tundra''.\n\nThe decision to not include all pre-existing Pok\u00e9mon in ''Sword'' and ''Shield'' was met with backlash from a segment of the fan community, resulting in trends such as \"Dexit\" and \"Bring Back National Dex\" and calls for a [[boycott]] months ahead of their release. Despite this, ''Sword'' and ''Shield'' received generally positive reviews from critics. Particular praise was aimed at the creature design, new features, and the emphasis on simplicity, player freedom, and streamlined encounters, although some criticized the game's smaller Pok\u00e9dex and a perceived lack of polish or depth. By the end of 2019, ''Sword'' and ''Shield'' had sold more than sixteen million copies worldwide, becoming the fastest-selling games on the Switch. \n\n==Gameplay==\n{{see also|Gameplay of Pok\u00e9mon}}\n''Pok\u00e9mon Sword'' and ''Shield'' are [[role-playing video game]]s with [[adventure game|adventure]] elements,<ref name=\"introduction\">{{cite web |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/pokemon-sword-shield-release-date-trailer-details-2019-2 |title=Everything we know about 'Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield,' the newly released Pok\u00e9mon games for Nintendo Switch |last=Webb |first=Kevin |work=[[Business Insider]] |date=November 15, 2019 |accessdate=March 14, 2020}}</ref> and in most cases it is presented in a [[Virtual camera system#Fixed|fixed camera]], [[third-person (video games)|third-person]] perspective; in certain instances [[Virtual camera system#Interactive|free camera movement]] is available.<ref name=\"introduction\"/> The player controls a young trainer who goes on a quest to catch and train creatures known as Pok\u00e9mon, and win [[Pok\u00e9mon battle|battles]] against other trainers. By defeating opposing Pok\u00e9mon in turn-based battles, the player's Pok\u00e9mon gains [[experience points|experience]], allowing them to level up and increase their battle statistics, learn new battle techniques, and in some cases, [[Pok\u00e9mon evolution|evolve]] into more powerful Pok\u00e9mon. Players can capture wild Pok\u00e9mon, found during wild encounters, by weakening them in battle and catching them with [[Pok\u00e9 Ball]]s, allowing them to be added to their [[party (role-playing games)|party]]. Players are also able to battle and [[Pok\u00e9mon trading|trade]] Pok\u00e9mon with other human players using the Nintendo Switch connectivity features. As with previous games in the series, certain Pok\u00e9mon are only obtainable in either ''Sword'' or ''Shield'', with players encouraged to trade with others in order to obtain all Pok\u00e9mon from both versions.<ref name=\"introduction\"/>\n\n''Sword'' and ''Shield'' takes place in the Galar region, based on the [[United Kingdom]]. As with all regions, Galar consists of a number of cities and towns connected by \"Routes\"; however, there is also an [[open world]] area in the center of the region known as the \"Wild Area\", a concept new to the series. [[Random encounter]]s with wild Pok\u00e9mon may take place in tall grass or in bodies of water along routes or in the Wild Area. Wild Pok\u00e9mon may also be encountered outside of tall grass and elsewhere in the environment, and may chase or run away from the player depending on their disposition. The player occasionally battles Trainers in cities, towns, along routes, and in the Wild Area. The driving force bringing the player to travel around the Galar region is to take part in the \"Gym Challenge\", an open-tournament to decide the greatest Pok\u00e9mon Trainer in the region, dubbed the Champion. Eight of the game's cities and towns are homes to stadiums housing \"Gym Leaders\", powerful Trainers specializing in certain types of Pok\u00e9mon; beating a Gym Leader gives the player a \"Badge\".<ref name=\"introduction\"/> After attaining eight Badges the player will be able to take part in the \"Champion Cup\", where they will face off in a [[single-elimination tournament]] against the previously faced Gym Leaders and other Trainers remaining in the Gym Challenge. After emerging victorious the player will face the Champion of the Galar region.<ref name=\"introduction\"/>\n\n===New features===\n{{see also|List of generation VIII Pok\u00e9mon}}\n[[File:Pokemon Sword and Shield Max Raid.jpg|thumb|Here, the player and three [[Non-player character|NPCs]] work together to take down a Dynamaxed Pok\u00e9mon|alt=]]\nSeveral new features for the games are also firsts for the series, including cooperative [[raid (video gaming)|raid]] encounters, akin to those seen in ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Go]]''; the Wild Area, a fully explorable [[open world]] area with free camera movement and dynamic weather, which has implications on which Pok\u00e9mon species appear at a given time;<ref name=\"Wild Area\">{{cite web|publisher=The Pok\u00e9mon Company|year=2019|accessdate=July 14, 2019|title=Check Out the Natural Beauty of the Wild Area|url=https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/gameplay/wild-area/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190708173055/https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/gameplay/wild-area/|archive-date=July 8, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> and \"Dynamaxing\" and \"Gigantamaxing\", both of which temporarily allow Pok\u00e9mon to grow to larger sizes.<ref name=kotaku-june5>{{cite web |url=https://kotaku.com/pokemon-sword-and-shield-will-have-co-op-raids-and-eve-1835266586 |title=Pok\u00e9mon Sword And Shield Will Have Co-Op Raids (And Everything Else We Learned Today) |website=[[Kotaku]] |date=June 5, 2019 |access-date=June 6, 2019 |first=Gita |last=Jackson |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190605222216/https://kotaku.com/pokemon-sword-and-shield-will-have-co-op-raids-and-eve-1835266586 |archive-date=June 5, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-sword-and-shield-reveal-more-new-gen-8-pok/1100-6467390/ |title=Pokemon Sword And Shield Reveal More New Gen 8 Pokemon |website=[[Gamespot]] |date=June 6, 2019 |access-date=June 6, 2019 |first=Kevin |last=Knezevic |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190606151943/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-sword-and-shield-reveal-more-new-gen-8-pok/1100-6467390/ |archive-date=June 6, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Gigantamaxing is limited to select Pok\u00e9mon and feature different forms from the Pok\u00e9mon's normal appearance.<ref name=\"TV_0708\"/> A new mechanic called \"Pok\u00e9 Jobs\" tasks the player's Pok\u00e9mon with completing requests, such as assisting in construction or cooking, to gain experience or rare items.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=The Pok\u00e9mon Company|date=August 7, 2019|accessdate=August 7, 2019|series=''Pok\u00e9mon Sword'' and ''Shield'' Gameplay|title=Pok\u00e9 Jobs|url=https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/gameplay/pokejobs/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190807153659/https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/gameplay/pokejobs/|archive-date=August 7, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> In addition, Pok\u00e9mon native to the game's region can be transferred to the games from the [[Nintendo 3DS]] app ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Bank]]'', ''Pok\u00e9mon Go'', and [[Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu!

The player and their best friend, Hop, receive one of three [[starter Pok\u00e9mon]]: Grookey, Scorbunny, or Sobble from Leon, Champion of the Galar region and Hop's older brother. Afterward, the two explore a forest called the Slumbering Weald but are driven off by a powerful Pok\u00e9mon. During their subsequent visit to the region's Pok\u00e9mon Professor, Magnolia, they convince Leon to endorse them to take part in the Gym Challenge. After traveling to the next city to register for the Gym Challenge, they encounter rivals Bede and Marnie along with Team Yell, a devout group of hooligans who act as Marnie's unintentional fanbase and are determined to stop anyone else from completing the Challenge.\n\n[[File:Westminster (59295502).jpeg|left|thumb|The Galar region was heavily inspired by the United Kingdom, with the main city\u2014Wyndon\u2014being a representation of [[London]] (pictured). The in-game city has the Rose of the Rondelands, a building inspired by the [[Houses of Parliament]].|alt=]]\nAs their quest continues, the player and Hop learn about two Legendary Pok\u00e9mon who saved Galar from an ancient crisis called the Darkest Day and deduce that they are the same Pok\u00e9mon they encountered in the Slumbering Weald. After beating the 8 Gym Leaders, including the leader of Team Yell, the player makes their way to Wyndon where they compete in the Champion's Cup for the opportunity to fight Leon. After winning the tournament, the player and Leon agree to have their battle the next day and decide to go have dinner together with Hop. They meet at the hotel, but Leon doesn't show up. The player and Hop find him discussing something with Chairman Rose. The next day, before the battle between the player and Leon can commence, Chairman Rose awakens the Pok\u00e9mon Eternatus in an attempt to harness its power to provide energy to Galar, triggering a second Darkest Day. The player and Hop return to the Slumbering Weald and secure the aid of the legendary Pok\u00e9mon, Zacian and Zamazenta, to defeat Chairman Rose and Eternatus, after which the player catches Eternatus. The player then faces and defeats Leon in a battle and becomes the new Champion of the Galar region.\n\nAfter defeating Leon, the player and Hop return to the Slumbering Weald to return Zacian and Zamazenta's artifacts to their rightful place. However, they are confronted by Sordward and Shielbert, two brothers claiming to be descendants of ancient Galarian kings. The two steal one of the relics and begin forcing innocent Pok\u00e9mon to Dynamax. The player and Hop work with the Gym Leaders to subdue the Dynamax Pok\u00e9mon and then track down and confront the brothers. They use Dynamax energy to drive Zamazenta (in ''Sword'') or Zacian (in ''Shield'') berserk, and the player drives them off with the help of Zacian (in ''Sword'') or Zamazenta (in ''Shield''). They then are challenged to a battle by the Legendary Pok\u00e9mon and allowed to catch it, while Hop follows Zamazenta/Zacian back to the Slumbering Weald and calms it down, being chosen by it as its Trainer. The player and Hop have a final battle, after which Hop decides to become a Pok\u00e9mon Professor.\n\n==Development==\n{{see also|List of generation VIII Pok\u00e9mon#Design and development}}\nDevelopment of ''Pok\u00e9mon Sword'' and ''Shield'' began immediately following the development of ''Sun'' and ''Moon'' in autumn 2016. Shigeru Ohmori, who previosuly directed Sun and Moon, formed a team who begun thinking about ideas for the title. Kazumasa Iwao, director of [[Pok\u00e9mon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon]] later joined the project as planning director and full production started in September 2017. One of the first ideas the team had was making Pok\u00e9mon giant because you now could play Pok\u00e9mon in the TV in a big screen, so then Ohmori thought about having a sword and a shield Pok\u00e9mon to defeat the giant Pok\u00e9mon; that's how the games titles were decided.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamefreak.co.jp/recruit/projectstory-pokemon/|title=\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc1\uff5c\u63a1\u7528\u60c5\u5831\uff5cGAME FREAK \u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30af|website=\u63a1\u7528\u60c5\u5831\uff5cGAME FREAK \u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30af|language=ja|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref><ref name=\"pokemon.com2019-06-13\">{{cite web |url=https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/we-interview-junichi-masuda-and-shigeru-ohmori-about-pokemon-sword-and-pokemon-shield/ |title=We Interview Junichi Masuda and Shigeru Ohmori about Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Pok\u00e9mon Shield |publisher=The Pok\u00e9mon Company |date=June 13, 2019 |access-date=June 16, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190616081647/https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/we-interview-junichi-masuda-and-shigeru-ohmori-about-pokemon-sword-and-pokemon-shield/ |archive-date=June 16, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nApproximately 1,000&nbsp;people from multiple companies were involved in the development, marketing, and public relations associated with ''Sword'' and ''Shield''.

''Pok\u00e9mon Sword'' and ''Pok\u00e9mon Shield'' received \"generally favorable reviews\" according to [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].<ref name=\"MetaSword\" /><ref name=\"MetaShield\" /> Critics praised the games' simplicity, new elements such as Dynamaxing, and streamlined battle encounters but criticized the incomplete Pok\u00e9dex and not taking full advantage of the games' potential.\n\nBrian Shea from ''[[Game Informer]]'' particularly praised the new Dynamax feature for being visually and strategically exciting without being overused: \"while the Dynamax mechanic has the potential to disrupt the flow of any battle, it doesn't factor into most encounters, since it can only be used in Gym battles and select other situations\".<ref name=\"GameInformer\" /> Casey DeFreitas for ''[[IGN]]'' also praised ''Sword'' and ''Shield'' for their fun gameplay and lack of monotonous activities, while criticizing aspects such as cutscenes and lack of a full Pok\u00e9dex.<ref name=\"IGN\" /> Writing for ''[[GameSpot]]'', Kallie Plagge also praised the pair for easy-to-understand game systems and a sense of freedom stating, \"you're not held back by overly complicated back-end systems or hoops to jump through; from the outset, you can start wandering the Galar region, seeing its new Pok\u00e9mon, and trying out its new battle strategies with very little in your way.\"\n\nConversely, Chris Tapsell for ''[[Eurogamer]]'' criticized the games, commenting that it lacked substance and did not live up to previous titles in the series. Tapsell commented \"this is a new generation of ''Pok\u00e9mon'' games that promises much, with brilliant new Pok\u00e9mon, a raft of intricate system-tinkering for long-term fans and a series-first stab at an 'open-world' area. But all that's new seems to have come at a cost \u2013 and the cost is almost everything else in the game.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Tapsell |first1=Chris |title=Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield review \u2013 a shadow of a former great |url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-13-pokemon-sword-and-shield-review-a-shadow-of-a-former-great |website=[[Eurogamer]] |accessdate=November 13, 2019 |date=November 13, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191113142048/https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-13-pokemon-sword-and-shield-review-a-shadow-of-a-former-great |archive-date=November 13, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> James Grebey and Tom Philip of ''[[GQ]]'' also felt somewhat underwhelmed, praising the Wild Area but stating that the games were \"satisfying but pedestrian\" and feel like \"proof of concept [with] another stage of evolution left for console ''Pok\u00e9mon'' games\".

They are the first installments in the eighth generation of the [[Pok\u00e9mon (video game series)|''Pok\u00e9mon'' video game series]] and the second in the series, after [[Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!|''Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu!'' and ''Let's Go, Eevee!'']], to be released on a [[home game console]]. Originally teased at [[E3 2017]] and announced in February 2019, ''Pok\u00e9mon Sword'' and ''Shield'' were released on November 15, 2019.\n\n''Sword'' and ''Shield''{{'s}} concept planning began immediately following the completion of [[Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon|''Pok\u00e9mon Sun'' and ''Moon'']] in 2016, while full production began a year later in September 2017. Like previous installments, they chronicle the journey of a young Pok\u00e9mon trainer aiming to become the Pok\u00e9mon Champion, this time in the new Galar region, which is based on the [[United Kingdom]]. The main objective of the games is to dethrone the Pok\u00e9mon League Champion, Leon, in a tournament that various other Gym Leaders and rivals also take part in, whilst dealing with Team Yell and a nefarious conspiracy within the League. ''Sword'' and ''Shield'' introduce [[List of generation VIII Pok\u00e9mon|81 new Pok\u00e9mon]] alongside [[List of generation VIII Pok\u00e9mon#Galarian Forms|13 regional variants]] of pre-existing Pok\u00e9mon; Dynamaxing, which increases the size of Pok\u00e9mon under certain conditions; Gigantamaxing, which additionally changes the form of certain Pok\u00e9mon; and the Wild Area, which is a large, open-world area with free camera movement that contains co-op raid battles. The two games also reintroduce features previously seen in ''Sun'' and ''Moon'' and ''Let's Go, Pikachu!'' and ''Let's Go, Eevee!'', such as regional variants and roaming Pok\u00e9mon depicted in the overworld. The games will receive two [[expansion pack]]s in 2020, ''The Isle of Armor'' and ''The Crown Tundra''.\n\nThe decision to not include all pre-existing Pok\u00e9mon in ''Sword'' and ''Shield'' was met with backlash from a segment of the fan community, resulting in trends such as \"Dexit\" and \"Bring Back National Dex\" and calls for a [[boycott]] months ahead of their release. Despite this, ''Sword'' and ''Shield'' received generally positive reviews from critics. Particular praise was aimed at the creature design, new features, and the emphasis on simplicity, player freedom, and streamlined encounters, although some criticized the game's smaller Pok\u00e9dex and a perceived lack of polish or depth. By the end of 2019, ''Sword'' and ''Shield'' had sold more than sixteen million copies worldwide, becoming the fastest-selling games on the Switch. \n\n==Gameplay==\n{{see also|Gameplay of Pok\u00e9mon}}\n''Pok\u00e9mon Sword'' and ''Shield'' are [[role-playing video game]]s with [[adventure game|adventure]] elements,<ref name=\"introduction\">{{cite web |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/pokemon-sword-shield-release-date-trailer-details-2019-2 |title=Everything we know about 'Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield,' the newly released Pok\u00e9mon games for Nintendo Switch |last=Webb |first=Kevin |work=[[Business Insider]] |date=November 15, 2019 |accessdate=March 14, 2020}}</ref> and in most cases it is presented in a [[Virtual camera system#Fixed|fixed camera]], [[third-person (video games)|third-person]] perspective; in certain instances [[Virtual camera system#Interactive|free camera movement]] is available.<ref name=\"introduction\"/> The player controls a young trainer who goes on a quest to catch and train creatures known as Pok\u00e9mon, and win [[Pok\u00e9mon battle|battles]] against other trainers. By defeating opposing Pok\u00e9mon in turn-based battles, the player's Pok\u00e9mon gains [[experience points|experience]], allowing them to level up and increase their battle statistics, learn new battle techniques, and in some cases, [[Pok\u00e9mon evolution|evolve]] into more powerful Pok\u00e9mon. Players can capture wild Pok\u00e9mon, found during wild encounters, by weakening them in battle and catching them with [[Pok\u00e9 Ball]]s, allowing them to be added to their [[party (role-playing games)|party]].

As with all regions, Galar consists of a number of cities and towns connected by \"Routes\"; however, there is also an [[open world]] area in the center of the region known as the \"Wild Area\", a concept new to the series. [[Random encounter]]s with wild Pok\u00e9mon may take place in tall grass or in bodies of water along routes or in the Wild Area. Wild Pok\u00e9mon may also be encountered outside of tall grass and elsewhere in the environment, and may chase or run away from the player depending on their disposition. The player occasionally battles Trainers in cities, towns, along routes, and in the Wild Area. The driving force bringing the player to travel around the Galar region is to take part in the \"Gym Challenge\", an open-tournament to decide the greatest Pok\u00e9mon Trainer in the region, dubbed the Champion. Eight of the game's cities and towns are homes to stadiums housing \"Gym Leaders\", powerful Trainers specializing in certain types of Pok\u00e9mon; beating a Gym Leader gives the player a \"Badge\".<ref name=\"introduction\"/> After attaining eight Badges the player will be able to take part in the \"Champion Cup\", where they will face off in a [[single-elimination tournament]] against the previously faced Gym Leaders and other Trainers remaining in the Gym Challenge.

The player and their best friend, Hop, receive one of three [[starter Pok\u00e9mon]]: Grookey, Scorbunny, or Sobble from Leon, Champion of the Galar region and Hop's older brother. Afterward, the two explore a forest called the Slumbering Weald but are driven off by a powerful Pok\u00e9mon. During their subsequent visit to the region's Pok\u00e9mon Professor, Magnolia, they convince Leon to endorse them to take part in the Gym Challenge. After traveling to the next city to register for the Gym Challenge, they encounter rivals Bede and Marnie along with Team Yell, a devout group of hooligans who act as Marnie's unintentional fanbase and are determined to stop anyone else from completing the Challenge.\n\n[[File:Westminster (59295502).jpeg|left|thumb|The Galar region was heavily inspired by the United Kingdom, with the main city\u2014Wyndon\u2014being a representation of [[London]] (pictured). The in-game city has the Rose of the Rondelands, a building inspired by the [[Houses of Parliament]].|alt=]]\nAs their quest continues, the player and Hop learn about two Legendary Pok\u00e9mon who saved Galar from an ancient crisis called the Darkest Day and deduce that they are the same Pok\u00e9mon they encountered in the Slumbering Weald. After beating the 8 Gym Leaders, including the leader of Team Yell, the player makes their way to Wyndon where they compete in the Champion's Cup for the opportunity to fight Leon. After winning the tournament, the player and Leon agree to have their battle the next day and decide to go have dinner together with Hop. They meet at the hotel, but Leon doesn't show up. The player and Hop find him discussing something with Chairman Rose. The next day, before the battle between the player and Leon can commence, Chairman Rose awakens the Pok\u00e9mon Eternatus in an attempt to harness its power to provide energy to Galar, triggering a second Darkest Day. The player and Hop return to the Slumbering Weald and secure the aid of the legendary Pok\u00e9mon, Zacian and Zamazenta, to defeat Chairman Rose and Eternatus, after which the player catches Eternatus. The player then faces and defeats Leon in a battle and becomes the new Champion of the Galar region.\n\nAfter defeating Leon, the player and Hop return to the Slumbering Weald to return Zacian and Zamazenta's artifacts to their rightful place. However, they are confronted by Sordward and Shielbert, two brothers claiming to be descendants of ancient Galarian kings. The two steal one of the relics and begin forcing innocent Pok\u00e9mon to Dynamax. The player and Hop work with the Gym Leaders to subdue the Dynamax Pok\u00e9mon and then track down and confront the brothers. They use Dynamax energy to drive Zamazenta (in ''Sword'') or Zacian (in ''Shield'') berserk, and the player drives them off with the help of Zacian (in ''Sword'') or Zamazenta (in ''Shield''). They then are challenged to a battle by the Legendary Pok\u00e9mon and allowed to catch it, while Hop follows Zamazenta/Zacian back to the Slumbering Weald and calms it down, being chosen by it as its Trainer. The player and Hop have a final battle, after which Hop decides to become a Pok\u00e9mon Professor.\n\n==Development==\n{{see also|List of generation VIII Pok\u00e9mon#Design and development}}\nDevelopment of ''Pok\u00e9mon Sword'' and ''Shield'' began immediately following the development of ''Sun'' and ''Moon'' in autumn 2016.

Kazumasa Iwao, director of [[Pok\u00e9mon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon]] later joined the project as planning director and full production started in September 2017. One of the first ideas the team had was making Pok\u00e9mon giant because you now could play Pok\u00e9mon in the TV in a big screen, so then Ohmori thought about having a sword and a shield Pok\u00e9mon to defeat the giant Pok\u00e9mon; that's how the games titles were decided.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamefreak.co.jp/recruit/projectstory-pokemon/|title=\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc1\uff5c\u63a1\u7528\u60c5\u5831\uff5cGAME FREAK \u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30af|website=\u63a1\u7528\u60c5\u5831\uff5cGAME FREAK \u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30af|language=ja|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref><ref name=\"pokemon.com2019-06-13\">{{cite web |url=https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/we-interview-junichi-masuda-and-shigeru-ohmori-about-pokemon-sword-and-pokemon-shield/ |title=We Interview Junichi Masuda and Shigeru Ohmori about Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Pok\u00e9mon Shield |publisher=The Pok\u00e9mon Company |date=June 13, 2019 |access-date=June 16, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190616081647/https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/we-interview-junichi-masuda-and-shigeru-ohmori-about-pokemon-sword-and-pokemon-shield/ |archive-date=June 16, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nApproximately 1,000&nbsp;people from multiple companies were involved in the development, marketing, and public relations associated with ''Sword'' and ''Shield''.

''Pok\u00e9mon Sword'' and ''Pok\u00e9mon Shield'' received \"generally favorable reviews\" according to [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].<ref name=\"MetaSword\" /><ref name=\"MetaShield\" /> Critics praised the games' simplicity, new elements such as Dynamaxing, and streamlined battle encounters but criticized the incomplete Pok\u00e9dex and not taking full advantage of the games' potential.\n\nBrian Shea from ''[[Game Informer]]'' particularly praised the new Dynamax feature for being visually and strategically exciting without being overused: \"while the Dynamax mechanic has the potential to disrupt the flow of any battle, it doesn't factor into most encounters, since it can only be used in Gym battles and select other situations\".<ref name=\"GameInformer\" /> Casey DeFreitas for ''[[IGN]]'' also praised ''Sword'' and ''Shield'' for their fun gameplay and lack of monotonous activities, while criticizing aspects such as cutscenes and lack of a full Pok\u00e9dex.<ref name=\"IGN\" /> Writing for ''[[GameSpot]]'', Kallie Plagge also praised the pair for easy-to-understand game systems and a sense of freedom stating, \"you're not held back by overly complicated back-end systems or hoops to jump through; from the outset, you can start wandering the Galar region, seeing its new Pok\u00e9mon, and trying out its new battle strategies with very little in your way.\"\n\nConversely, Chris Tapsell for ''[[Eurogamer]]'' criticized the games, commenting that it lacked substance and did not live up to previous titles in the series. Tapsell commented \"this is a new generation of ''Pok\u00e9mon'' games that promises much, with brilliant new Pok\u00e9mon, a raft of intricate system-tinkering for long-term fans and a series-first stab at an 'open-world' area. But all that's new seems to have come at a cost \u2013 and the cost is almost everything else in the game.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Tapsell |first1=Chris |title=Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield review \u2013 a shadow of a former great |url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-13-pokemon-sword-and-shield-review-a-shadow-of-a-former-great |website=[[Eurogamer]] |accessdate=November 13, 2019 |date=November 13, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191113142048/https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-13-pokemon-sword-and-shield-review-a-shadow-of-a-former-great |archive-date=November 13, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> James Grebey and Tom Philip of ''[[GQ]]'' also felt somewhat underwhelmed, praising the Wild Area but stating that the games were \"satisfying but pedestrian\" and feel like \"proof of concept [with] another stage of evolution left for console ''Pok\u00e9mon'' games\".

He argues that Canadian reformers took their inspiration from the [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism of the American Revolution]]. The rebels believed that the right of citizens to participate in the political process through the election of representatives was the most important right, and they sought to make the legislative council elective rather than appointed. Rebellion in Upper Canada (and Lower Canada also) broke out after the 1836 Legislative Assembly elections were corrupted. It seemed then that the reformers' struggles could only be settled outside the framework of existing colonial institutions. The [[British military]] crushed the rebellions, ending any possibility the two Canadas would become republics.<ref>Michel Ducharme, [http://www.americanantiquarian.org/proceedings/44539644.pdf \"Closing the Last Chapter of the Atlantic Revolution: The 1837\u201338 Rebellions in Upper and Lower Canada,\"] ''Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society,'' Oct 2006, Vol. 116 Issue 2, pp 413\u2013430</ref> Some historians see ties to the [[Chartism|Chartist]] [[Newport Rising|Newport Uprising]] of 1839 in Wales, suppressed by [[Sir Francis Bond Head]]'s cousin, Sir [[Edmund Walker Head]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Schrauwers|first=Albert|title=Union is Strength: W.L.

Many of the rebels (including Mackenzie) fled to the [[United States]]. Mackenzie established a short-lived \"[[Republic of Canada]]\" on [[Navy Island]] in the Niagara River, but withdrew from armed conflict soon thereafter. [[Charles Duncombe (Upper Canada Rebellion)|Charles Duncombe]] and [[Robert Nelson (insurrectionist)|Robert Nelson]], in contrast, helped foment a largely American militia, the [[Hunters' Lodges|Hunters' Lodge]]/[[Fr\u00e8res chasseurs]], which organised a convention in Cleveland in September 1838 to declare another [[Republic of Lower Canada]].

In Lower Canada they were known as the [[Ch\u00e2teau Clique]]; in Upper Canada they were known as the [[Family Compact]]. Both office-holding oligarchies were affiliated with more broadly based \"[[Tory]] parties\" and opposed by a Reform opposition that demanded a radically more democratic government than existed in each colony.{{sfn|Greer|1995|p=10}}\n[[File:L'Assembl\u00e9e des six comt\u00e9s \u00e0 Saint-Charles-sur-Richelieu, en 1837 by Charles Alexander 1891.tif|thumb|Establishment of the ''[[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Fils de la Libert\u00e9]]'', 1837. Reformers in both colonies created political unions that were used to organize protests, and eventually rebellion.]]\nThe governments in both provinces were viewed by the Reformers as illegitimate. In Lower Canada acute conflict between the elected and appointed elements of the legislature brought all legislation to a halt, leaving the Tories to impose [[Lord John Russell]]'s Ten Resolutions, allowing them to rule without elected accountability. In Upper Canada the 1836 elections had been marred by political violence and fraud organized by the new Lt. Governor, [[Sir Francis Bond Head]]. [[William Lyon Mackenzie]] and [[Samuel Lount]] lost their seats in the result. The Tories passed a bill allowing them to continue to sit in disregard of the established practice of dissolving the House on the death of a monarch ([[King William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]] died in June 1837).{{sfn|Greer|1995|p=11}}\n\nIn the midst of this crisis of legitimacy, the Atlantic economy was thrown into recession, with the greatest impact being on farmers. These farmers barely survived widespread crop failures in 1836\u201337, and now faced lawsuits from merchants trying to collect old debts. The collapse of the international financial system imperiled trade and local banks, leaving large numbers in abject poverty.\n\nIn response, Reformers in each province organized radical democratic \"political unions.\" The Political Union movement in Britain was largely credited with the passing of the [[Great Reform Bill]] of 1832. In Lower Canada the Patriots organized the [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Fils de la Libert\u00e9]] (\"Sons of Liberty\"). William Lyon Mackenzie helped organize the Toronto Political Union in July 1837. Both organizations became the vehicles for politically organizing protests, and eventually rebellion. As the situation in Lower Canada approached crisis the British concentrated their troops there, making it apparent that they planned on using armed force against the Patriots. With no troops left in Upper Canada, an opportunity for a sympathetic revolt was opened.{{sfn|Greer|1995|pp=13\u201314}}\n\n===Differences===\n{{Wikisource|Report on the Affairs of British North America}}\nSince the time of [[Lord Durham's Report]] on the Rebellions, the Lower Canada Rebellion has been attributed to tensions between the English and the French, that the conflict was \"'racial' and, as a consequence, it was sharper than\u2013indeed fundamentally different from\u2014the milder strife that disturbed 'English' Upper Canada.\"{{sfn|Greer|1995|p=9}} Despite being true, this interpretation underestimates the republicanism of the Patriots.\n\nThe Lower Canada rebellion was widely supported by the populace, due to economic and political subordination of the French Canadians, resulting in mass actions over an extended period of time, such as boycotts, strikes and sabotage. These drew harsh punitive reprisals such as the burning of entire villages, rapes and other forms of psychological humiliation{{sfn|Greer|1993|p=4}} by government troops and militias, which had been concentrated in Lower Canada to deal with the crisis. By contrast, the Upper Canada Rebellion was not as broadly supported by local populations, was quickly quelled by relatively small numbers of pro-government militias and volunteers and was consequently less widespread and brutal by comparison.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{main|Province of Canada|Act of Union 1840|Responsible government}}\n[[File:United Canada 1840.png|thumb|275px|Government structure of the [[Province of Canada]] under the ''[[Act of Union 1840]]''. Shortly after the rebellions, [[Lower Canada|Lower]] and [[Upper Canada]] were combined into one province.]]\nThose rebels who were arrested in Upper Canada following the 1837 uprisings were put on trial, and most were found guilty of [[insurrection]] against the Crown. One of the most severe punishments was the sentencing of 100 Canadian rebels and American sympathizers to life in Britain's [[Convicts in Australia|Australian prison colonies]]. Many were publicly hanged, most notably [[Samuel Lount]] and Peter Matthews. The public hangings of the rebels took place in Court House Square, in between Toronto's new jail and courthouse. The Foreman of Public Works, [[Joseph Sheard]], was expected to share in the work of building the scaffold for Lount's and Matthews' execution. However, he claimed the men had done nothing that he wouldn't have and refused to assist. The Orange militia stood guard during the execution to deter a rescue.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Peppiatt|first1=Liam|title=Chapter 34: The Jails of the County|url=http://www.landmarksoftoronto.com/the-jails-of-the-county/|website=Robertson's Landmarks of Toronto Revisited}}</ref>\n\nThe root cause of resentment in Upper Canada was not so much against distant rulers in Britain, but rather against the corruption and injustice by local politicians\u2014the so-called \"Family Compact\". However, the rebels were not really convicted because their views aligned with the liberalism of the US, and thus caused some kind of offense to the [[Tory]] values of the Canadian colonies. Rather, as revealed in the ruling of [[Chief Justice]] [[Sir John Robinson, 1st Baronet, of Toronto|Sir John Robinson]], a [[John Locke|Lockean]] justification was given for the prisoners' condemnation, and not a [[Edmund Burke|Burkean]] one: the Crown, as protector of the lives, liberty and prosperity of its subjects, could \"legitimately demand allegiance to its authority.\" Robinson went on to say that those who preferred republicanism over monarchism were free to emigrate, and thus the participants in the uprisings were guilty of [[treason]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fierlbeck |first=Katherine |title=Canada: more liberal than Tory?

They proved to be influential when the British government sent [[John George Lambton, Earl of Durham|Lord Durham]], a prominent reformer, to investigate the cause of the troubles. Among the recommendations in [[Report on the Affairs of British North America|his report]] was the establishment of [[responsible government]] for the colonies, one of the rebels' original demands (although it was not achieved until 1849). Durham also recommended the merging of Upper and Lower Canada into a single political unit ([[Act of Union 1840|the Act of Union]]), which became the nucleus for modern-day Canada.  More controversially, he recommended the government-sponsored [[cultural assimilation]] of French Canadians to the English language and culture.<ref>{{cite book|author=John George Lambton Earl of Durham|title=Lord Durham's Report on the Affairs of British North America: Text of the report|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qTozAQAAIAAJ&dq=lord+durham+report&hl=fr&source=gbs_navlinks_s|publisher=Clarendon Press|pages=294\u2013295}}</ref> In fact, the merging of the Upper and Lower Canada was intended to take any form of self-government away from the French Canadians, forcing them into becoming a smaller part of the new, larger, political unit.<ref>{{cite book|author=John George Lambton Earl of Durham|title=Lord Durham's Report on the Affairs of British North America: Text of the report|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qTozAQAAIAAJ&dq=lord+durham+report&hl=fr&source=gbs_navlinks_s|publisher=Clarendon Press|page=296}}</ref>\n\nIn geopolitical terms the Rebellions and the subsequent Patriot War altered the landscape of relations between Britain and British colonial authorities on one hand, and the American government on the other. Both nations were dedicated to a peace policy due to a budding financial crisis and to a sense of perceived disadvantage which both felt equally. Both were legitimately concerned about the disruption in relations which radical ideas might foment through further rebellion and raids. An unprecedented level of cooperation occurred in diplomatic and military circles. Far from the Rebellions being entirely domestic events, the administration of American president Martin Van Buren had little choice but to implement mitigating measures on US soil to prevent escalation. As they evolved into the Patriot War, the Rebellions contributed to the construction of more recent Anglo-American and Canada-US relations.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lacroix |first=Patrick |title=Choosing Peace and Order: National Security and Sovereignty in a North American Borderland, 1837\u201342 |url= |journal=International History Review |publisher= |volume= |issue= |pages= | date=6 October 2015 |doi=10.1080/07075332.2015.1070892 }}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nIn 1937, exactly one century after the Rebellion, the names of William Mackenzie and Louis-Joseph Papineau were applied to the [[Mackenzie\u2013Papineau Battalion]] or the Mac-Paps, a battalion of officially unrecognised Canadian volunteers who fought on the Republican side in Spain during the [[Spanish Civil War]].

He argues that Canadian reformers took their inspiration from the [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism of the American Revolution]]. The rebels believed that the right of citizens to participate in the political process through the election of representatives was the most important right, and they sought to make the legislative council elective rather than appointed. Rebellion in Upper Canada (and Lower Canada also) broke out after the 1836 Legislative Assembly elections were corrupted. It seemed then that the reformers' struggles could only be settled outside the framework of existing colonial institutions. The [[British military]] crushed the rebellions, ending any possibility the two Canadas would become republics.<ref>Michel Ducharme, [http://www.americanantiquarian.org/proceedings/44539644.pdf \"Closing the Last Chapter of the Atlantic Revolution: The 1837\u201338 Rebellions in Upper and Lower Canada,\"] ''Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society,'' Oct 2006, Vol. 116 Issue 2, pp 413\u2013430</ref> Some historians see ties to the [[Chartism|Chartist]] [[Newport Rising|Newport Uprising]] of 1839 in Wales, suppressed by [[Sir Francis Bond Head]]'s cousin, Sir [[Edmund Walker Head]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Schrauwers|first=Albert|title=Union is Strength: W.L.

Many of the rebels (including Mackenzie) fled to the [[United States]]. Mackenzie established a short-lived \"[[Republic of Canada]]\" on [[Navy Island]] in the Niagara River, but withdrew from armed conflict soon thereafter. [[Charles Duncombe (Upper Canada Rebellion)|Charles Duncombe]] and [[Robert Nelson (insurrectionist)|Robert Nelson]], in contrast, helped foment a largely American militia, the [[Hunters' Lodges|Hunters' Lodge]]/[[Fr\u00e8res chasseurs]], which organised a convention in Cleveland in September 1838 to declare another [[Republic of Lower Canada]].

In Lower Canada they were known as the [[Ch\u00e2teau Clique]]; in Upper Canada they were known as the [[Family Compact]]. Both office-holding oligarchies were affiliated with more broadly based \"[[Tory]] parties\" and opposed by a Reform opposition that demanded a radically more democratic government than existed in each colony.{{sfn|Greer|1995|p=10}}\n[[File:L'Assembl\u00e9e des six comt\u00e9s \u00e0 Saint-Charles-sur-Richelieu, en 1837 by Charles Alexander 1891.tif|thumb|Establishment of the ''[[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Fils de la Libert\u00e9]]'', 1837. Reformers in both colonies created political unions that were used to organize protests, and eventually rebellion.]]\nThe governments in both provinces were viewed by the Reformers as illegitimate. In Lower Canada acute conflict between the elected and appointed elements of the legislature brought all legislation to a halt, leaving the Tories to impose [[Lord John Russell]]'s Ten Resolutions, allowing them to rule without elected accountability. In Upper Canada the 1836 elections had been marred by political violence and fraud organized by the new Lt. Governor, [[Sir Francis Bond Head]]. [[William Lyon Mackenzie]] and [[Samuel Lount]] lost their seats in the result. The Tories passed a bill allowing them to continue to sit in disregard of the established practice of dissolving the House on the death of a monarch ([[King William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]] died in June 1837).{{sfn|Greer|1995|p=11}}\n\nIn the midst of this crisis of legitimacy, the Atlantic economy was thrown into recession, with the greatest impact being on farmers. These farmers barely survived widespread crop failures in 1836\u201337, and now faced lawsuits from merchants trying to collect old debts. The collapse of the international financial system imperiled trade and local banks, leaving large numbers in abject poverty.\n\nIn response, Reformers in each province organized radical democratic \"political unions.\" The Political Union movement in Britain was largely credited with the passing of the [[Great Reform Bill]] of 1832. In Lower Canada the Patriots organized the [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Fils de la Libert\u00e9]] (\"Sons of Liberty\"). William Lyon Mackenzie helped organize the Toronto Political Union in July 1837. Both organizations became the vehicles for politically organizing protests, and eventually rebellion. As the situation in Lower Canada approached crisis the British concentrated their troops there, making it apparent that they planned on using armed force against the Patriots. With no troops left in Upper Canada, an opportunity for a sympathetic revolt was opened.{{sfn|Greer|1995|pp=13\u201314}}\n\n===Differences===\n{{Wikisource|Report on the Affairs of British North America}}\nSince the time of [[Lord Durham's Report]] on the Rebellions, the Lower Canada Rebellion has been attributed to tensions between the English and the French, that the conflict was \"'racial' and, as a consequence, it was sharper than\u2013indeed fundamentally different from\u2014the milder strife that disturbed 'English' Upper Canada.\"{{sfn|Greer|1995|p=9}} Despite being true, this interpretation underestimates the republicanism of the Patriots.\n\nThe Lower Canada rebellion was widely supported by the populace, due to economic and political subordination of the French Canadians, resulting in mass actions over an extended period of time, such as boycotts, strikes and sabotage. These drew harsh punitive reprisals such as the burning of entire villages, rapes and other forms of psychological humiliation{{sfn|Greer|1993|p=4}} by government troops and militias, which had been concentrated in Lower Canada to deal with the crisis. By contrast, the Upper Canada Rebellion was not as broadly supported by local populations, was quickly quelled by relatively small numbers of pro-government militias and volunteers and was consequently less widespread and brutal by comparison.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{main|Province of Canada|Act of Union 1840|Responsible government}}\n[[File:United Canada 1840.png|thumb|275px|Government structure of the [[Province of Canada]] under the ''[[Act of Union 1840]]''. Shortly after the rebellions, [[Lower Canada|Lower]] and [[Upper Canada]] were combined into one province.]]\nThose rebels who were arrested in Upper Canada following the 1837 uprisings were put on trial, and most were found guilty of [[insurrection]] against the Crown. One of the most severe punishments was the sentencing of 100 Canadian rebels and American sympathizers to life in Britain's [[Convicts in Australia|Australian prison colonies]]. Many were publicly hanged, most notably [[Samuel Lount]] and Peter Matthews. The public hangings of the rebels took place in Court House Square, in between Toronto's new jail and courthouse. The Foreman of Public Works, [[Joseph Sheard]], was expected to share in the work of building the scaffold for Lount's and Matthews' execution. However, he claimed the men had done nothing that he wouldn't have and refused to assist. The Orange militia stood guard during the execution to deter a rescue.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Peppiatt|first1=Liam|title=Chapter 34: The Jails of the County|url=http://www.landmarksoftoronto.com/the-jails-of-the-county/|website=Robertson's Landmarks of Toronto Revisited}}</ref>\n\nThe root cause of resentment in Upper Canada was not so much against distant rulers in Britain, but rather against the corruption and injustice by local politicians\u2014the so-called \"Family Compact\". However, the rebels were not really convicted because their views aligned with the liberalism of the US, and thus caused some kind of offense to the [[Tory]] values of the Canadian colonies. Rather, as revealed in the ruling of [[Chief Justice]] [[Sir John Robinson, 1st Baronet, of Toronto|Sir John Robinson]], a [[John Locke|Lockean]] justification was given for the prisoners' condemnation, and not a [[Edmund Burke|Burkean]] one: the Crown, as protector of the lives, liberty and prosperity of its subjects, could \"legitimately demand allegiance to its authority.\" Robinson went on to say that those who preferred republicanism over monarchism were free to emigrate, and thus the participants in the uprisings were guilty of [[treason]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fierlbeck |first=Katherine |title=Canada: more liberal than Tory?

They proved to be influential when the British government sent [[John George Lambton, Earl of Durham|Lord Durham]], a prominent reformer, to investigate the cause of the troubles. Among the recommendations in [[Report on the Affairs of British North America|his report]] was the establishment of [[responsible government]] for the colonies, one of the rebels' original demands (although it was not achieved until 1849). Durham also recommended the merging of Upper and Lower Canada into a single political unit ([[Act of Union 1840|the Act of Union]]), which became the nucleus for modern-day Canada.  More controversially, he recommended the government-sponsored [[cultural assimilation]] of French Canadians to the English language and culture.<ref>{{cite book|author=John George Lambton Earl of Durham|title=Lord Durham's Report on the Affairs of British North America: Text of the report|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qTozAQAAIAAJ&dq=lord+durham+report&hl=fr&source=gbs_navlinks_s|publisher=Clarendon Press|pages=294\u2013295}}</ref> In fact, the merging of the Upper and Lower Canada was intended to take any form of self-government away from the French Canadians, forcing them into becoming a smaller part of the new, larger, political unit.<ref>{{cite book|author=John George Lambton Earl of Durham|title=Lord Durham's Report on the Affairs of British North America: Text of the report|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qTozAQAAIAAJ&dq=lord+durham+report&hl=fr&source=gbs_navlinks_s|publisher=Clarendon Press|page=296}}</ref>\n\nIn geopolitical terms the Rebellions and the subsequent Patriot War altered the landscape of relations between Britain and British colonial authorities on one hand, and the American government on the other. Both nations were dedicated to a peace policy due to a budding financial crisis and to a sense of perceived disadvantage which both felt equally. Both were legitimately concerned about the disruption in relations which radical ideas might foment through further rebellion and raids. An unprecedented level of cooperation occurred in diplomatic and military circles. Far from the Rebellions being entirely domestic events, the administration of American president Martin Van Buren had little choice but to implement mitigating measures on US soil to prevent escalation. As they evolved into the Patriot War, the Rebellions contributed to the construction of more recent Anglo-American and Canada-US relations.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lacroix |first=Patrick |title=Choosing Peace and Order: National Security and Sovereignty in a North American Borderland, 1837\u201342 |url= |journal=International History Review |publisher= |volume= |issue= |pages= | date=6 October 2015 |doi=10.1080/07075332.2015.1070892 }}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nIn 1937, exactly one century after the Rebellion, the names of William Mackenzie and Louis-Joseph Papineau were applied to the [[Mackenzie\u2013Papineau Battalion]] or the Mac-Paps, a battalion of officially unrecognised Canadian volunteers who fought on the Republican side in Spain during the [[Spanish Civil War]].

The film was released by [[20th Century Fox]] and released on video by [[CBS/Fox Video|Key Video]]  (a division of CBS/FOX Video), and is now out of print.  The special effects were by [[Stan Winston]].<ref name=pallister/><ref name=fsr/>\n\n==Plot==\nCarl Lehman ([[David McIlwraith]]) is a scientist working on a next-generation [[space suit]] for the ARC corporation, run by the sinister Alex Whyte ([[Richard Cox (actor)|Richard Cox]]), where all kinds of high-tech research is being conducted. One of these projects is developing \"rage program\" software that can sense when a user is provoked/endangered and take over its brain to destroy the attacker and then return to normal once the threat has been eliminated.  The software is shown to be tested on monkeys, one of which dies after Whyte, out of curiosity, has the rage factor turned up beyond safe levels.\n\nAfter Carl confronts Whyte about some suspicious funding cuts, Whyte sends his employee Massey to rig an explosion in Carl's lab to kill him and disguise the death as a lab accident.\n\nARC informs Carl's pregnant wife Lauren ([[Teri Austin]]) and daughter Catherine ([[Catherine Disher]]) that Carl has died. In reality, Whyte is keeping Carl's charred body in a suspension of oxygenating fluid which keeps his brain functioning. Using Carl's space suit and ARC's cutting-edge [[prosthetics]] technology, they build Carl a cyborg body and dub him \"Project Frankenstein\". The rage program is also installed, with a remote control unit acting as a safeguard. The reanimation initially fails, so researcher Gail Vernon (Lynda Mason Green) disassembles the suit. After the remote control unit is removed, a short circuit causes Carl to suddenly revive.  When she tries to reinstall his control unit, he pushes Gail away.  She falls onto a control panel, which releases all of the lab monkeys.  They attack Gail in a rage and kill her.\n\nCarl sneaks out of the building and stows away on a [[garbage truck]], which drops him into an incinerator.  His flight suit is burned away, revealing the cybernetic prosthetics underneath. However, thanks to his immense strength, he is able to break out and heads for his residence. On the way, some street thugs chase him into an alley.  When they attack him, his suit activates and sends him into a rage and he brutally overpowers and kills all of them. Realizing that the rage program forbids close contact with people, he talks to his wife from outside their house through a faulty ground wire in the synthesizer in their living room that they had earlier discovered receives radio signals. \n\nLater, the thugs' bodies are discovered. Whyte, fearing a police investigation of Project Frankenstein, hires the elite assassin Hunter ([[Pam Grier]]) to track down and eliminate Carl.\n\nThe next day, Lauren visits Carl's colleague and friend Burt Arthurs ([[Maury Chaykin]]) to tell him about her conversation with Carl. Burt shows her security footage of the accident to convince her of Carl's death. In the evening, Carl's voice comes over the synthesizer again; this time, however, Whyte's accomplice Kessler is monitoring them. Carl learns that Massey signed his autopsy report and death certificate, and sets out to confront him. At his home, secured by Hunter's forces, Massey is snorting [[cocaine]] and evicting his girlfriend Lisa, when Carl appears to interrogate him. In doing so, Carl learns that if he can get to the suit's programming, he can remove the rage program. Massey shoots Carl in panic, which causes Carl to again lose control and he throws Massey out of the window. Lisa bears witness, so Hunter kills her to cover up the project.\n\nCarl flees down the [[sewerage|sewers]], and Hunter gives pursuit along with her men. They corner Carl, and their guns damage his life-support system. Carl defends himself by ripping open a [[Natural gas|gas]] line and manages to incinerate Hunter's men as well as Kessler, then escapes. Hunter confronts Whyte, who had not disclosed the Frankenstein enhancements, and he admits that the enhanced Carl is nearly indestructible. Meanwhile, Carl arranges a meeting with Lauren by coded message. Upset over his grotesque appearance, he exhorts her to leave him and move far away. He also asks her to summon Burt's help, which she does.  Carl meets with him but, unbeknownst to Carl, Burt has betrayed him and is working for Whyte and the two have set a trap for Carl.  He falls through a weakened floor into a trap of quick-setting resin. Whyte sends the block of resin to ARC, but Carl's strength prevails and he breaks out during transport.  Meanwhile, Whyte tells Burt that he has to get rid of Lauren as well if he wants to keep his high paying position.\n\nBurt goes to the Lehman residence, where he confesses his love for Lauren and suggests that they should escape and be together and become a family. Lauren rebuffs him so he angrily assaults her by [[strangulation]]. Catherine comes home and attacks Burt and she and Lauren overpower him.  As they are trying to escape, Hunter arrives and kills Catherine and Burt knocks Lauren unconscious. Burt knows that he is ruined if Lauren escapes, so Hunter advises that he take Lauren and Catherine and dump them in the nearby lake.  \n\nCarl shows up and, in a panic, Burt rams him repeatedly with his car.  Carl is sent into another rage and he crushes Burt's car, killing him, but not before Lauren slips out of the passenger door.  However, she is captured by Hunter and taken to ARC to lure Carl. Meanwhile, Whyte's girlfriend is being interrogated by the police, hinting that Project Frankenstein will be investigated and defused.\n\nAt ARC, Carl manages to evade the security cameras for some time, so Hunter goes on the [[intercom]] and threatens to kill Lauren unless he comes to the laboratory to bargain for her. There, Hunter throws Lauren onto Carl to provoke him, but he does not go into a rage, since he reprogrammed himself in the computer room while the cameras weren't monitoring him. Realizing she is no match for the cyborg, Hunter commits [[suicide]]. Carl and Lauren get to Whyte, who has continued his experiment by turning the corpses of Gail and Kessler into cyborgs and has programmed them to protect him.  Whyte is also wearing one of the suits himself. Carl, his life-support failing, battles Whyte while Lauren dispatches the others by pulling their own life-support [[umbilical cables]]. As Whyte begins to overpower Carl, Lauren hands him an umbilical, which he connects to Whyte's suit and drowns him by filling his suit with fluid. His own fluid supply exhausted, Carl expires.\n\nYears later, Lauren is visiting an aeronautics museum with her son Carl Jr. There, they admire a display of the suits, one of which is Carl's original suit.  A guide is heard explaining a fabricated story that Carl was the first to valiantly test the suit and that as a result of his suit being torched, they were able to fix its weaknesses and were able to then successfully deploy them on Mars.  Meanwhile, Carl Jr. asks if he was a hero, to which Lauren responds that he was.\n\n==Cast==\n\n*[[David McIlwraith]] as Carl\n*[[Teri Austin]] as Lauren\n*[[Richard Cox (actor)|Richard Cox]] as Whyte\n*[[Pam Grier]] as Hunter\n*[[Maury Chaykin]] as Burt\n==Production==\n''The Vindicator'' was filmed in Montreal.<ref name=pallister/>\n\n==Critical reaction==\nJanis L.

The series is a sequel to the 1953 film ''[[The War of the Worlds (1953 film)|The War of the Worlds]]'', a loose adaptation of the [[The War of the Worlds|novel of the same title]] by [[H. G. Wells]], using the same [[Tripod (War of the Worlds)|war machine]] designs and often incorporating aspects from the film, [[The War of the Worlds (radio)|radio adaptation]], and the original novel into its mythology.\n\nThough the original film's producer, [[George Pal]], envisioned a TV series from the same film sometime in the 1970s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.war-ofthe-worlds.co.uk/war_of_the_worlds_tv_pal.htm|title=George Pal's War Of The Worlds TV Series (Circa 1975)|work=War of the Worlds \u2013 Invasion: The Historical Perspective|accessdate=March 20, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303174259/http://www.war-ofthe-worlds.co.uk/war_of_the_worlds_tv_pal.htm|archivedate=March 3, 2016}}</ref> it was not until the late 1980s that a series was finally realized, this time by television producer Greg Strangis. The show was a part of the boom of first-run syndicated television series being produced at the time. It was later shown in reruns on the [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]].\n\nThe series was filmed in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada.\n\n== Premise ==\nAccording to the series, rather than being killed outright by [[Microorganism|germ]]s at the end of the 1953 film, the aliens had all slipped into a state of [[suspended animation]]. Their bodies were stored away in toxic waste drums and shipped to various disposal sites within the United States (ten such sites are known to exist in the country<ref>Dumpsite locations are visible on a map from the episode \"The Last Supper\".</ref>), and a widespread government [[cover-up]] combined with a condition dubbed \u201c[[selective amnesia]]\u201d has convinced most people that the invasion had never happened.\n\nAlthough the original movie narration had explicitly stated that the aliens were Martians (even featuring artwork indicating an alien city on the planet [[Mars (planet)|Mars]]), since 1953 the concept of vastly intelligent life on Mars had lost plausibility. In the series, the aliens are revealed to actually be from [[Mor-Tax]]\u2014a garden planet 40 [[light-year]]s away in the [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus constellation]] orbiting a dying sun.\n\nThirty-five years later, in 1988 (modern day when the series began), a terrorist group calling itself the People's Liberation Party accidentally irradiates the drums containing the aliens while raiding the dumpsite near Fort Jericho. The radiation destroys the bacteria that were keeping the aliens unconscious. Once free, the aliens take possession of the bodies of the six terrorists who overran the site. From there they use a series of human bodies and crudely adapted Earth technology to find means of appropriating the planet, both in removing humanity and developing a permanent means to inoculate themselves against the planet's indigenous bacteria. Their attempt to successfully make Earth into their new homeworld is imperative for in roughly five years, three million colonists from Mor-Tax are expected to arrive.\n\n== Plot ==\n=== First season ===\nOpening narration (spoken in [[voice-over]] by Martin in character as Blackwood):\n\n{{Quote|''In 1953, Earth experienced a War of the Worlds. Common bacteria stopped the aliens, but it didn't kill them. Instead, the aliens lapsed into a state of deep hibernation. Now the aliens have been resurrected, more terrifying than before. In 1953, the aliens started taking over the world; today, they're taking over our bodies!''<ref>This is the quote originally used. For reasons unknown a different take of Martin's reading is used in the second half of the season. The quote is verbatim of the first except he now says that the aliens are \"more terrifying than {{em|ever}} before.\"</ref>}}\n\nAlong with other [[science fiction|sci-fi]]/[[horror fiction|horror]] series that ran in syndication in the late 1980s (such as ''[[Friday the 13th: The Series]]'' and ''[[Freddy's Nightmares]]''), ''War of the Worlds'' constantly pushed the \u201cacceptable content\u201d envelope, regularly featuring violence on par with the [[MPAA film rating system|R-rated]] horror movies of the time. Gore is commonplace in the first season: dead aliens and their tossed-away hosts\u2019 bodies melt in a grotesque puddle and the ruthless Mor-Taxans have no compunctions about torturing or mutilating any human who gets in their way. One of their trademark methods of murder would be gouged-out eyes courtesy of the third arm that would often burst out from their chest.\n\nDuring the first season, the aliens are led by a [[triumvirate]] known as the Advocacy. They are a part of their society's ruling class, overseeing the invasion force on Earth while their leaders, the invisible and never heard Council, remain back on Mor-Tax. Outfitted throughout most of the season in contamination suits that pump coolant to counteract the killing heat of the radiation they need, they stay in their base of operation: a cavern in the [[Nevada]] desert, which is perfect due to the ambient radiation from [[nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]] tests. Due to the risks to their lives, they rarely venture into the outside world because without the Advocacy the lower classes would have no guidance and be useless.\n\nTheir goal is to pick up where they left off in 1953 by making way on Earth for the three million colonists heading in exodus from their dying world. Their major objective in order to accomplish this [[terraforming]] is to remove humanity from the planet. The aliens\u2019 hatred of human beings goes beyond simple prejudice. Having come from a planet that can be compared to the [[Garden of Eden]] based on its description, the aliens see that humans do nothing but desecrate what they would call a paradise, and most importantly, a new home. Without humans in the way, they can restore the vegetation, and better replicate the conditions of their deceased world. To carry out a successful war, they seek out weapons (some of which are their own left behind from previous visitations), help amass their army, and engage in infiltration and all sorts of acts of warfare. But to make things more problematic, they must also find immunity against the germs that befell them in 1953.\n\nThe simplicity of the alien invasion storyline is countered in the first season by the addition of anomalous entities whose motives are only partially explained:\n\n* Quinn: An alien trapped in a human host since the invasion of \u201953, mysteriously immune to bacteria, and ready to play both of the major warring factions against each other for his own favor.\n* The Qar\u2019To: An unknown alien race represented by a synthetic lifeform sent to Earth, they want the [[Mor-Taxan]]s dead and humanity preserved, but for sinister reasons.\n* Project 9: A shadow government organization much like the Blackwood Project, but more interested in alien research than in resisting or countering the Mor-Taxan invasion plans.\n\nA number of recurring allies are presented for the Blackwood team. Sylvia Van Buren (a character from the George Pal film reprised by the original actress, [[Ann Robinson]]), who was a colleague of Dr. Forrester, has since the end of the war developed the ability to sense the aliens and is prone to fairly accurate precognitive visions. The aliens\u2019 scientific arsenal has little power over the supernatural powers of shaman Joseph Lonetree (whose presence is seemingly foreshadowed in the first episode). The team even makes friends with the remaining [[Grover's Mill]] militia of 1938 who had their own run-in with the aliens.\n\nA recurring element in the series is the [[3 (number)|number three]]. This is an extension of the film, wherein the aliens\u2019 physiology, technology and society are rooted in multiples of three: from their caste system (ruling class, soldiers, and scientists) to their bodies (three arms with three fingers), weaponry (in \u201cThe Resurrection\u201d, they make [[bolas]] with three weighted ends), and even their mating cycle is every nine years (three times three years). The appearance of the number in some form is sprinkled throughout the season in reference to the aliens.\n\nThe episodes all had (often ironic) [[Bible|Biblical]] titles, such as \"The Walls of Jericho\", \"To Heal the Leper\", and \"Among the Philistines\".\n\n\u201cTo Life Immortal\u201d (''too doe nakotae''<ref>This spelling can be seen onscreen in \"Among the Philistines\" on Norton's computer monitor. Another spelling variation is visible as well, but it is not seen clearly enough.</ref> as it would be said in the aliens\u2019 [[first language|native tongue]]), a phrase by which the aliens seem to sum up their belief system, is a common exchange between aliens, as a pledge to their shared goal or as a battle cry before honorable self-sacrifice. It later became a popular [[catchphrase]] among the show's fans.\n\n=== Second season ===\nOpening voice-over:\n\n{{Quote|There's rioting breaking out through the city. Fire is continuing to burn everywhere. Troops are shooting people. My God, I...I don't know why! There's a woman dying in front of me, and no one's helping her! There are conflicting reports about who or what started the chaos. Will someone tell me what's happening? This is madness! What is this world coming to?|source=Off screen news reporter as the camera flies around a model night-time cityscape}}\n\nThe creative team of Season 1 was replaced, bringing in [[Frank Mancuso, Jr.]], who was also busy producing ''[[Friday the 13th: The Series]]''. Many aspects of the show were retooled, such as the title sequence and music, and much of the black humor and Biblical references were removed. Norton and Ironhorse, two major characters from the first season, are killed off in the season premiere and replaced by mercenary John Kincaid ([[Adrian Paul]]).\n\nThe modern-day setting of the first season shifted to a not-too-distant future of \"Almost Tomorrow\" where the world has since spiraled into a dismal state with its economy, environment, and government all beaten down. The antagonists of the first season are replaced by the Morthren, from Mothrai; while the first season aliens were said to be from the planet Mor-Tax, there is a half-hearted explanation for this change in the final episode. The Morthren exterminate all the aliens from the first season for their failure to eradicate humanity.\n\nWhereas bacteria and radiation are constant problems for the aliens in the first season, the Morthren have quickly found a cure-all means for this by transmutating into human bodies. With this, they forwent the ability to possess human bodies, retaining only one human body. These bodies are however easily damaged; as seen in the series a single bullet wound is enough to cause the aliens' human form to break down, killing them. Their equivalent of body-swapping is a cloning machine that makes exact copies of someone, only differing in that the duplicates would be loyal to the Morthren cause and their existence tied to the original. Ironically, as sores are the telltale signs of alien possession in the first season, a lack of scars or any physical flaw was a telltale sign of a clone, as the Morthren are fixated with perfection. While the Eternal is their god, the Morthren are led by Malzor (played by [[Denis Forest]], who had a large part in the Season 1 episode \u201cVengeance Is Mine\u201d). Just under him was the scientist Mana ([[Catherine Disher]], whose husband also played a major role in a Season 1 episode) with Ardix ([[Julian Richings]] who appeared briefly in \u201cHe Feedeth Among the Lillies\u201d) as her assistant.\n\nMeanwhile, with General Wilson missing, the Cottage destroyed, and two team members lost in battle, the remnants of the team, with mercenary Kincaid, seek shelter. They take up base in an underground hideout in the sewers.  Some of the characters experience shifts, such as Harrison carrying a gun, becoming more sullen and losing his more quirky personality traits. The friction between the militaristic Ironhorse and the other team members was not transferred with Kincaid, who got along well with everyone, who themselves became more militaristic in season 2. The show's theme of warfare between two races, and all the issues that come with it, was replaced by a theme of a bleak life on a desolate world.\n\nAlthough the series was canceled after 14 episodes had been broadcast, six more episodes were completed. This also gave the production team the opportunity to create a finale, \"The Obelisk\", which offers a conclusive ending to the series as a whole.\n\n== Cast ==\n=== Main cast ===\nAn eclectic group is formed by the government to deal with the new alien threat, and the series follows their missions and adventures (and often failures) in fighting the aliens. The Blackwood Project, named after its central member, consists of the following:\n\n* Dr. Harrison Blackwood ([[Jared Martin]]): [[astrophysics|Astrophysicist]] whose parents were killed in the 1953 invasion. He was adopted following the events of the film by [[Doctor Clayton Forrester (War of the Worlds)|Dr. Clayton Forrester]] and Blackwood's character is played very much to resemble Forrester down to his demeanor, dress, and even his speech and appearance. He is a [[pacifism|pacifist]] and a [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]], and is often seen practicing many alternative health techniques such as [[yoga]] during the first season, but becomes grittier in the second.\n* Dr. Suzanne McCullough (Lynda Mason Green): [[Microbiology|Microbiologist]] and single mother to Debi. She firmly embraces standard procedure in her work, which causes friction with Blackwood and his chaotic and eccentric work habits.\n* Debi McCullough ([[Rachel Blanchard]])\n* Norton Drake ([[Philip Akin]], season 1): A long-time friend of Harrison, he is a [[paraplegic]] computer genius who is granted mobility via a voice-activated wheelchair named Gertrude. He is often portrayed as being cool and laid back with a good sense of humor. In earlier episodes he had a pseudo-Caribbean accent; this was later dropped.\n* Lt. Col. Paul Ironhorse ([[Richard Chaves]], season 1): Military man. He is rather conservative and often clashes with the other members of the team, especially Blackwood who is his political and philosophical opposite.\n* John Kincaid ([[Adrian Paul]], season 2): Human resistance member\n* Malzor ([[Denis Forest]], season 2): Alien commander\n* Mana ([[Catherine Disher]], season 2): Alien scientist\n\n=== Notable guest stars ===\nThe first season featured some recognisable actors in the series. Aside from getting [[Ann Robinson]] to reprise her role as Sylvia van Buren from the film, the series also obtained [[John Colicos]] (from ''[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'') as rogue alien Quinn who, while only appearing twice, was no doubt intended to play an integral part of the series as it went on (the character's power-hungry nature and middleman status between two worlds is noticeably reminiscent of Colicos\u2019 role as [[Count Baltar]]). The list of notable guests begins in the show's very start with [[John Vernon]] appearing in the first two episodes as General Wilson. Other actors throughout the series: [[Patrick Macnee]], [[Greg Morris]], [[Jeff Corey]], [[John Ireland (actor)|John Ireland]], [[Colm Feore]], and [[James Hong]].\n\nThe series was also the early working ground for future stars (including [[Chris Potter (actor)|Chris Potter]] who made his acting debut in episode two). Aside from exclusive season two star [[Adrian Paul]] (of ''[[Highlander (TV series)|Highlander]]'' fame), the second season also featured the first onscreen appearance of (a then very young) [[Mia Kirshner]]. The second season also gave more screentime to [[Rachel Blanchard]], who only had minor play in the first season.\n\n== Episodes ==\n===Season 1 (1988\u201389)===\n{{Episode table\n|background=#B0171F\n|overall=5\n|season=5\n|title=22\n|director=17\n|writer=34\n|airdate=17\n|episodes=\n\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 1<hr />2\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 1<hr />2\n| Title           = The Resurrection\n| DirectedBy      = Colin Chilvers\n| WrittenBy       = Greg Strangis\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1988|10|7}}\n| ShortSummary    = In 1953, a worldwide alien invasion would have eliminated humanity had the extraterrestrial invaders not been vulnerable to the indigenous bacteria on the planet.

M. Dillard.

A common criticism of the DVDs has been the poor image quality; fans in particular also point out the omission of the alien hand animation from the opening credits that had been inexplicably removed from every episode.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.war-of-the-worlds.org/Series/Schedules.shtml|title=Brief DVD review at The Complete War of the Worlds Website|work=War-of-the-Worlds.org|accessdate=March 20, 2016}}</ref> The set contains no special features. It does, however, allow the viewer to jump to a chapter, which are divided by act, including the opening and closing credits, but are not available via any menu.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} It also includes [[closed captioning]], but these may not be entirely reliable as there are several clear errors - for example, it is inconsistent in how it spells the name of the [[Mor-Tax|aliens' homeworld]], neither of which is the canonical spelling. By contrast, however, in a few episodes, the captioning refers to the Advocates by the name of their original host bodies from the pilot episode (i.e. Chambers, Urick, and Einhorn), even in the absence of the original actors.{{original research inline|date=May 2012}}\n\nThe second and final season was released on October 26, 2010, nearly five years after the release of the first season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/War-Worlds-Season-2/14212|title=\"War of the Worlds: The Second Invasion\" Comes to DVD At Last with the Second and Final Season|last=Lambert|first=David|work=TV Shows on DVD|date=August 9, 2010|accessdate=March 20, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401100232/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/War-Worlds-Season-2/14212|archivedate=April 1, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn Region 2, [[Revelation Films]] has released both seasons on DVD in the UK.

The series is a sequel to the 1953 film ''[[The War of the Worlds (1953 film)|The War of the Worlds]]'', a loose adaptation of the [[The War of the Worlds|novel of the same title]] by [[H. G. Wells]], using the same [[Tripod (War of the Worlds)|war machine]] designs and often incorporating aspects from the film, [[The War of the Worlds (radio)|radio adaptation]], and the original novel into its mythology.\n\nThough the original film's producer, [[George Pal]], envisioned a TV series from the same film sometime in the 1970s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.war-ofthe-worlds.co.uk/war_of_the_worlds_tv_pal.htm|title=George Pal's War Of The Worlds TV Series (Circa 1975)|work=War of the Worlds \u2013 Invasion: The Historical Perspective|accessdate=March 20, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303174259/http://www.war-ofthe-worlds.co.uk/war_of_the_worlds_tv_pal.htm|archivedate=March 3, 2016}}</ref> it was not until the late 1980s that a series was finally realized, this time by television producer Greg Strangis. The show was a part of the boom of first-run syndicated television series being produced at the time. It was later shown in reruns on the [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]].\n\nThe series was filmed in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada.\n\n== Premise ==\nAccording to the series, rather than being killed outright by [[Microorganism|germ]]s at the end of the 1953 film, the aliens had all slipped into a state of [[suspended animation]]. Their bodies were stored away in toxic waste drums and shipped to various disposal sites within the United States (ten such sites are known to exist in the country<ref>Dumpsite locations are visible on a map from the episode \"The Last Supper\".</ref>), and a widespread government [[cover-up]] combined with a condition dubbed \u201c[[selective amnesia]]\u201d has convinced most people that the invasion had never happened.\n\nAlthough the original movie narration had explicitly stated that the aliens were Martians (even featuring artwork indicating an alien city on the planet [[Mars (planet)|Mars]]), since 1953 the concept of vastly intelligent life on Mars had lost plausibility. In the series, the aliens are revealed to actually be from [[Mor-Tax]]\u2014a garden planet 40 [[light-year]]s away in the [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus constellation]] orbiting a dying sun.\n\nThirty-five years later, in 1988 (modern day when the series began), a terrorist group calling itself the People's Liberation Party accidentally irradiates the drums containing the aliens while raiding the dumpsite near Fort Jericho. The radiation destroys the bacteria that were keeping the aliens unconscious. Once free, the aliens take possession of the bodies of the six terrorists who overran the site. From there they use a series of human bodies and crudely adapted Earth technology to find means of appropriating the planet, both in removing humanity and developing a permanent means to inoculate themselves against the planet's indigenous bacteria. Their attempt to successfully make Earth into their new homeworld is imperative for in roughly five years, three million colonists from Mor-Tax are expected to arrive.\n\n== Plot ==\n=== First season ===\nOpening narration (spoken in [[voice-over]] by Martin in character as Blackwood):\n\n{{Quote|''In 1953, Earth experienced a War of the Worlds. Common bacteria stopped the aliens, but it didn't kill them. Instead, the aliens lapsed into a state of deep hibernation. Now the aliens have been resurrected, more terrifying than before. In 1953, the aliens started taking over the world; today, they're taking over our bodies!''<ref>This is the quote originally used. For reasons unknown a different take of Martin's reading is used in the second half of the season. The quote is verbatim of the first except he now says that the aliens are \"more terrifying than {{em|ever}} before.\"</ref>}}\n\nAlong with other [[science fiction|sci-fi]]/[[horror fiction|horror]] series that ran in syndication in the late 1980s (such as ''[[Friday the 13th: The Series]]'' and ''[[Freddy's Nightmares]]''), ''War of the Worlds'' constantly pushed the \u201cacceptable content\u201d envelope, regularly featuring violence on par with the [[MPAA film rating system|R-rated]] horror movies of the time. Gore is commonplace in the first season: dead aliens and their tossed-away hosts\u2019 bodies melt in a grotesque puddle and the ruthless Mor-Taxans have no compunctions about torturing or mutilating any human who gets in their way. One of their trademark methods of murder would be gouged-out eyes courtesy of the third arm that would often burst out from their chest.\n\nDuring the first season, the aliens are led by a [[triumvirate]] known as the Advocacy. They are a part of their society's ruling class, overseeing the invasion force on Earth while their leaders, the invisible and never heard Council, remain back on Mor-Tax. Outfitted throughout most of the season in contamination suits that pump coolant to counteract the killing heat of the radiation they need, they stay in their base of operation: a cavern in the [[Nevada]] desert, which is perfect due to the ambient radiation from [[nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]] tests. Due to the risks to their lives, they rarely venture into the outside world because without the Advocacy the lower classes would have no guidance and be useless.\n\nTheir goal is to pick up where they left off in 1953 by making way on Earth for the three million colonists heading in exodus from their dying world. Their major objective in order to accomplish this [[terraforming]] is to remove humanity from the planet. The aliens\u2019 hatred of human beings goes beyond simple prejudice. Having come from a planet that can be compared to the [[Garden of Eden]] based on its description, the aliens see that humans do nothing but desecrate what they would call a paradise, and most importantly, a new home. Without humans in the way, they can restore the vegetation, and better replicate the conditions of their deceased world. To carry out a successful war, they seek out weapons (some of which are their own left behind from previous visitations), help amass their army, and engage in infiltration and all sorts of acts of warfare. But to make things more problematic, they must also find immunity against the germs that befell them in 1953.\n\nThe simplicity of the alien invasion storyline is countered in the first season by the addition of anomalous entities whose motives are only partially explained:\n\n* Quinn: An alien trapped in a human host since the invasion of \u201953, mysteriously immune to bacteria, and ready to play both of the major warring factions against each other for his own favor.\n* The Qar\u2019To: An unknown alien race represented by a synthetic lifeform sent to Earth, they want the [[Mor-Taxan]]s dead and humanity preserved, but for sinister reasons.\n* Project 9: A shadow government organization much like the Blackwood Project, but more interested in alien research than in resisting or countering the Mor-Taxan invasion plans.\n\nA number of recurring allies are presented for the Blackwood team. Sylvia Van Buren (a character from the George Pal film reprised by the original actress, [[Ann Robinson]]), who was a colleague of Dr. Forrester, has since the end of the war developed the ability to sense the aliens and is prone to fairly accurate precognitive visions. The aliens\u2019 scientific arsenal has little power over the supernatural powers of shaman Joseph Lonetree (whose presence is seemingly foreshadowed in the first episode). The team even makes friends with the remaining [[Grover's Mill]] militia of 1938 who had their own run-in with the aliens.\n\nA recurring element in the series is the [[3 (number)|number three]]. This is an extension of the film, wherein the aliens\u2019 physiology, technology and society are rooted in multiples of three: from their caste system (ruling class, soldiers, and scientists) to their bodies (three arms with three fingers), weaponry (in \u201cThe Resurrection\u201d, they make [[bolas]] with three weighted ends), and even their mating cycle is every nine years (three times three years). The appearance of the number in some form is sprinkled throughout the season in reference to the aliens.\n\nThe episodes all had (often ironic) [[Bible|Biblical]] titles, such as \"The Walls of Jericho\", \"To Heal the Leper\", and \"Among the Philistines\".\n\n\u201cTo Life Immortal\u201d (''too doe nakotae''<ref>This spelling can be seen onscreen in \"Among the Philistines\" on Norton's computer monitor. Another spelling variation is visible as well, but it is not seen clearly enough.</ref> as it would be said in the aliens\u2019 [[first language|native tongue]]), a phrase by which the aliens seem to sum up their belief system, is a common exchange between aliens, as a pledge to their shared goal or as a battle cry before honorable self-sacrifice. It later became a popular [[catchphrase]] among the show's fans.\n\n=== Second season ===\nOpening voice-over:\n\n{{Quote|There's rioting breaking out through the city. Fire is continuing to burn everywhere. Troops are shooting people. My God, I...I don't know why! There's a woman dying in front of me, and no one's helping her! There are conflicting reports about who or what started the chaos. Will someone tell me what's happening? This is madness! What is this world coming to?|source=Off screen news reporter as the camera flies around a model night-time cityscape}}\n\nThe creative team of Season 1 was replaced, bringing in [[Frank Mancuso, Jr.]], who was also busy producing ''[[Friday the 13th: The Series]]''. Many aspects of the show were retooled, such as the title sequence and music, and much of the black humor and Biblical references were removed. Norton and Ironhorse, two major characters from the first season, are killed off in the season premiere and replaced by mercenary John Kincaid ([[Adrian Paul]]).\n\nThe modern-day setting of the first season shifted to a not-too-distant future of \"Almost Tomorrow\" where the world has since spiraled into a dismal state with its economy, environment, and government all beaten down. The antagonists of the first season are replaced by the Morthren, from Mothrai; while the first season aliens were said to be from the planet Mor-Tax, there is a half-hearted explanation for this change in the final episode. The Morthren exterminate all the aliens from the first season for their failure to eradicate humanity.\n\nWhereas bacteria and radiation are constant problems for the aliens in the first season, the Morthren have quickly found a cure-all means for this by transmutating into human bodies. With this, they forwent the ability to possess human bodies, retaining only one human body. These bodies are however easily damaged; as seen in the series a single bullet wound is enough to cause the aliens' human form to break down, killing them. Their equivalent of body-swapping is a cloning machine that makes exact copies of someone, only differing in that the duplicates would be loyal to the Morthren cause and their existence tied to the original. Ironically, as sores are the telltale signs of alien possession in the first season, a lack of scars or any physical flaw was a telltale sign of a clone, as the Morthren are fixated with perfection. While the Eternal is their god, the Morthren are led by Malzor (played by [[Denis Forest]], who had a large part in the Season 1 episode \u201cVengeance Is Mine\u201d). Just under him was the scientist Mana ([[Catherine Disher]], whose husband also played a major role in a Season 1 episode) with Ardix ([[Julian Richings]] who appeared briefly in \u201cHe Feedeth Among the Lillies\u201d) as her assistant.\n\nMeanwhile, with General Wilson missing, the Cottage destroyed, and two team members lost in battle, the remnants of the team, with mercenary Kincaid, seek shelter. They take up base in an underground hideout in the sewers.  Some of the characters experience shifts, such as Harrison carrying a gun, becoming more sullen and losing his more quirky personality traits. The friction between the militaristic Ironhorse and the other team members was not transferred with Kincaid, who got along well with everyone, who themselves became more militaristic in season 2. The show's theme of warfare between two races, and all the issues that come with it, was replaced by a theme of a bleak life on a desolate world.\n\nAlthough the series was canceled after 14 episodes had been broadcast, six more episodes were completed. This also gave the production team the opportunity to create a finale, \"The Obelisk\", which offers a conclusive ending to the series as a whole.\n\n== Cast ==\n=== Main cast ===\nAn eclectic group is formed by the government to deal with the new alien threat, and the series follows their missions and adventures (and often failures) in fighting the aliens. The Blackwood Project, named after its central member, consists of the following:\n\n* Dr. Harrison Blackwood ([[Jared Martin]]): [[astrophysics|Astrophysicist]] whose parents were killed in the 1953 invasion. He was adopted following the events of the film by [[Doctor Clayton Forrester (War of the Worlds)|Dr. Clayton Forrester]] and Blackwood's character is played very much to resemble Forrester down to his demeanor, dress, and even his speech and appearance. He is a [[pacifism|pacifist]] and a [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]], and is often seen practicing many alternative health techniques such as [[yoga]] during the first season, but becomes grittier in the second.\n* Dr. Suzanne McCullough ([[Lynda Mason Green]]): [[Microbiology|Microbiologist]] and single mother to Debi. She firmly embraces standard procedure in her work, which causes friction with Blackwood and his chaotic and eccentric work habits.\n* Debi McCullough ([[Rachel Blanchard]])\n* Norton Drake ([[Philip Akin]], season 1): A long-time friend of Harrison, he is a [[paraplegic]] computer genius who is granted mobility via a voice-activated wheelchair named Gertrude. He is often portrayed as being cool and laid back with a good sense of humor. In earlier episodes he had a pseudo-Caribbean accent; this was later dropped.\n* Lt. Col. Paul Ironhorse ([[Richard Chaves]], season 1): Military man. He is rather conservative and often clashes with the other members of the team, especially Blackwood who is his political and philosophical opposite.\n* John Kincaid ([[Adrian Paul]], season 2): Human resistance member\n* Malzor ([[Denis Forest]], season 2): Alien commander\n* Mana ([[Catherine Disher]], season 2): Alien scientist\n\n=== Notable guest stars ===\nThe first season featured some recognisable actors in the series. Aside from getting [[Ann Robinson]] to reprise her role as Sylvia van Buren from the film, the series also obtained [[John Colicos]] (from ''[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'') as rogue alien Quinn who, while only appearing twice, was no doubt intended to play an integral part of the series as it went on (the character's power-hungry nature and middleman status between two worlds is noticeably reminiscent of Colicos\u2019 role as [[Count Baltar]]). The list of notable guests begins in the show's very start with [[John Vernon]] appearing in the first two episodes as General Wilson. Other actors throughout the series: [[Patrick Macnee]], [[Greg Morris]], [[Jeff Corey]], [[John Ireland (actor)|John Ireland]], [[Colm Feore]], and [[James Hong]].\n\nThe series was also the early working ground for future stars (including [[Chris Potter (actor)|Chris Potter]] who made his acting debut in episode two). Aside from exclusive season two star [[Adrian Paul]] (of ''[[Highlander (TV series)|Highlander]]'' fame), the second season also featured the first onscreen appearance of (a then very young) [[Mia Kirshner]]. The second season also gave more screentime to [[Rachel Blanchard]], who only had minor play in the first season.\n\n== Episodes ==\n===Season 1 (1988\u201389)===\n{{Episode table\n|background=#B0171F\n|overall=5\n|season=5\n|title=22\n|director=17\n|writer=34\n|airdate=17\n|episodes=\n\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 1<hr />2\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 1<hr />2\n| Title           = The Resurrection\n| DirectedBy      = Colin Chilvers\n| WrittenBy       = Greg Strangis\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1988|10|7}}\n| ShortSummary    = In 1953, a worldwide alien invasion would have eliminated humanity had the extraterrestrial invaders not been vulnerable to the indigenous bacteria on the planet.

M. Dillard. While following the same narrative structure of the episode, the book contains characters from the 1953 film and scenes not included in the final cut of the pilot; it also explores more deeply the aliens' political motivations, and emphasizes denial instead of the \"selective amnesia\" aspect of the plot.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.trenchcoatsoft.com/2015/09/30/parenthesis-jm-dillards-novelization-of-war-of-the-worlds-the-resurrection/|title=Parenthesis: JM Dillard\u2019s Novelization of War of the Worlds: The Resurrection|date=September 30, 2015|accessdate=September 19, 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Home media ===\nOn November 1, 2005, [[Paramount Home Media Distribution]] released season 1 on DVD in Region 1.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/War-Worlds/3894|title=War of the Worlds - Paramount's official package shot for the 1st season|last=Lambert|first=David|work=TV Shows on DVD|date=August 12, 2005|accessdate=March 20, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401154748/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/War-Worlds/3894|archivedate=April 1, 2016}}</ref>  The set's release coincided with the DVD re-release of the 1953 film from which the show was spawned (the [[War of the Worlds (2005 film)|updated version]] from Steven Spielberg being released on DVD later the same month). A common criticism of the DVDs has been the poor image quality; fans in particular also point out the omission of the alien hand animation from the opening credits that had been inexplicably removed from every episode.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.war-of-the-worlds.org/Series/Schedules.shtml|title=Brief DVD review at The Complete War of the Worlds Website|work=War-of-the-Worlds.org|accessdate=March 20, 2016}}</ref> The set contains no special features. It does, however, allow the viewer to jump to a chapter, which are divided by act, including the opening and closing credits, but are not available via any menu.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} It also includes [[closed captioning]], but these may not be entirely reliable as there are several clear errors - for example, it is inconsistent in how it spells the name of the [[Mor-Tax|aliens' homeworld]], neither of which is the canonical spelling. By contrast, however, in a few episodes, the captioning refers to the Advocates by the name of their original host bodies from the pilot episode (i.e. Chambers, Urick, and Einhorn), even in the absence of the original actors.{{original research inline|date=May 2012}}\n\nThe second and final season was released on October 26, 2010, nearly five years after the release of the first season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/War-Worlds-Season-2/14212|title=\"War of the Worlds: The Second Invasion\" Comes to DVD At Last with the Second and Final Season|last=Lambert|first=David|work=TV Shows on DVD|date=August 9, 2010|accessdate=March 20, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401100232/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/War-Worlds-Season-2/14212|archivedate=April 1, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn Region 2, [[Revelation Films]] has released both seasons on DVD in the UK.
