Ledoux calls police headquarters and is told to go to the graveyard to thwart any theft. Meanwhile the police arrest the mad professor.

It is the northernmost [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] in the country, and also the smallest, both in population and land area. Its [[capital city|capital]] is [[Basco, Batanes|Basco]] located on the island of [[Batan Island|Batan]].<!--Batanes means \"Islands of batan\"-->\n\nThe island group is located approximately {{convert|162|km}} north of the [[Luzon]] mainland and about {{convert|190|km|mi|abbr=off}} south of [[Taiwan]], separated from the [[Babuyan Islands]] of [[Cagayan|Cagayan Province]] by the [[Balintang Channel]], and from Taiwan by the [[Bashi Channel]]. The entire province is listed in the [[UNESCO]] tentative list for inscription in the [[World Heritage List]]. The government has been finalizing the site's inscription, establishing museums and conservation programs since 2001. The government aims to push for the site's inclusion between 2018 and 2019. Seven intangible heritage elements of the Ivatan have been set by the Philippine government in its initial inventory in 2012. The elements are undergoing a process to be included in the [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists]] between 2018 and 2025.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Batanes'' derives from the words ''Batan'', the local word for the Ivatan people.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ivatan Man.jpg|thumb|An Ivatan holding one of many types of traditional Ivatan baskets.]]\nThe ancestors of today's Ivatans descended from Austronesians who migrated to the islands 4,000 years ago during the Neolithic period. They lived in fortified mountain areas called ''[[Batanes castles|idjangs]]'' and drank sugar-cane wine, or ''palek''. They also used gold as currency and produced a thriving agriculture-based industry. They were also seafarers and boat-builders.\n\nIn 1687, a crew of English [[Filibuster (military)|freebooters]] headed by [[William Dampier]] came with a Dutch crew and named the islands in honour of their country's nobility. Itbayat was named \"Orange Isle\" after [[William III of England|William of Orange]], and Batan was named \"Grafton Isle\" after [[Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Grafton]]. Sabtang Isle was named \"Monmouth Isle\" after [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth]]. Capt. Dampier stayed for less than three months, and did not claim the islands for the British crown.\n\nIn 1783, the Spanish claimed Batanes as part of the Philippines under the auspices of [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor-General]] [[Jos\u00e9 Basco y Vargas]]. The Bashi Channel was increasingly used by English East India Company ships and the Spanish authorities brought the islands under their direct administration to prevent them falling under British control.<ref>Howard T. Fry, \"The Eastern Passage and Its Impact on Spanish Policy in the Philippines, 1758\u20131790\", ''Philippine Studies,'' vol.33, First Quarter, 1985, pp.3\u201321, p.18.</ref> The [[Ivatan people|Ivatan]] remained on their ''[[Batanes castles|idjangs]]'', or mountain fortresses for some time. In 1790, Governor Guerrero {{Clarify|date=February 2007|reason=The Governor-general of the Philippines at this point in time is [[F\u00e9lix Berenguer de Marquina]], unless Guerrero refers to a governor of Batanes.}} decreed that Ivatans were to live in the lowlands and leave their remote ''idjang''. The mangpus, the indigenous Ivatan leader of the islands during that time, made a revolution against the Spaniards afterwards. With much ammunition and steel armors, the Spanish authorities quelled the uprising, effectively subjugating the rebels. Basco and Ivana were the first towns established under full Spanish control. Mahatao was then administered by Basco, while Uyugan and Sabtang, by Ivana. Itbayat was not organized until the 1850s, its coast being a ridge. Soon, Ilocanos came to the islands and integrated with the local population. Roads, ports, bridges, churches and government buildings were built in this time. Limestone technology used by the Spanish was also spread to the islands, making bridges strong and fortified. Some of these bridges still remain at Ivana and Mahatao. By 1890, many Ivatans were in Manila, and became ''ilustrados'', who then brought home with them the revolutionary ideas of the [[Katipunan]]. These Ivatans, who were then discontented with Spanish rule, killed the ruling General Fortea and declared the end of Spanish rule.\n\nToward the end of the Spanish administration, Batanes was made a part of Cagayan. In 1909, the new American authorities organized it into an independent province. During the American colonial period, additional public schools were constructed and more Ivatan became aware of their place in the Philippines. In 1920, the first wireless telegraph was installed, followed by an airfield in 1930. New roads were constructed and the Batanes High School was instituted.\n\nBecause of their strategic location, the islands was one of the first points occupied by invading Japanese imperial forces at the outbreak of the [[World War II|Pacific War]]. The morning of December 8, 1941, the Batan Task Force from [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Taiwan]] landed on the Batan Islands, which became the first American territory occupied by the Japanese. The purpose of the invasion was to secure the existing small airfield outside Basco, which was accomplished without resistance. Japanese fighters from Basco took part in the raid on [[History of Clark Air Base|Clark Air Base]] the following day. However, over the next several days, the success of the Japanese bombing of Clark Field rendered a base at Basco unnecessary, and on December 10, 1941, the naval combat force was withdrawn to participate in the [[Japanese invasion of Camiguin Island|invasion of Camiguin]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The First Landings|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-P-PI/USA-P-PI-6.html|accessdate=18 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nOne of the first School Superintendents on Batan was [[Victor de Padua]], an Ilocano, who in 1942\u201345 during the Japanese occupation was made Provincial Governor. Early in 1945 the island was liberated by the Philippine Commonwealth forces of the 1st and 12th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army. In 1984, [[Pacita Abad]], the foremost Ivatan visual artist, became the first woman to be awarded the Ten Outstanding Young Men (TOYM) award, breaking 25 years of male dominance. In her acceptance speech, she said, \"it was long overdue that Filipina women were recognized, as the Philippines was full of outstanding women\u201d and referred proudly to her mother.<ref>https://www.pacitaabad.com/Activities/Awards.php</ref>\n[[File:Oldest House in Ivatan.jpg|thumb|A ''Sinadumparan'' Ivatan house, one of the oldest structures in the Batanes islands. The house is made of [[limestone]] and [[coral]] and its roofing of [[Imperata cylindrica|cogon grass]].]]\nIn 1993, the Batanes Protected Landscape and Seascape, which encompassed the entire province, was listed in the Tentative List of the Philippines for [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] inscription in the future.<ref>https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/521/</ref> In 1997, the Indigenous Peoples Rights act or IPRA was passed in Philippine Congress. the law paved the way for the indigenous territorial rights of the Ivatans. The province has since promoted its Ivatan roots. Part of the Ilocano population has returned to mainland Luzon. In December 7, 2004, [[Pacita Abad]] died after finishing her last international art work while suffering from cancer.<ref>http://www.artnet.com/artists/pacita-abad/biography</ref>\n\n{{Back to contents}}\n\n==Geography==\n\nThe province has a total area of {{convert|{{PH wikidata|area}}|km2}}{{PSGC detail|nscb}} comprising ten islands situated within the [[Luzon Strait]] between the Balintang Channel and [[Taiwan]]. The islands are sparsely populated and subject to frequent typhoons. The three largest islands, [[Batan Island|Batan]], [[Itbayat Island|Itbayat]], and [[Sabtang Island|Sabtang]], are the only inhabited islands.\n\nThe northernmost island in the province, also the northernmost land in the entire Philippines, is [[Mavulis Island|Mavulis (or Y'ami) Island]]. Other islands in the chain are Misanga (or North), Ditarem, [[Siayan Island|Siayan]], Diogo (or Dinem), [[Ivuhos]], and [[Dequey]]. The islands are part of the [[Luzon Volcanic Arc]].\n\n===Topography===\nAlmost one-half of Batanes is [[hill]]s and [[mountain]]s. [[Batan Island]] is generally mountainous on the north and southeast. It has a basin in the interior. [[Itbayat Island]] slopes gradually to the west, being mountainous and hilly along its northern, eastern coast. As for Sabtang, mountains cover the central part, making the island slope outward to the coast.\n\nThe islands are situated between the vast expanse of the waters of [[Bashi Channel]] and [[Balintang Channel]], where the Pacific Ocean merges with the China Sea. The area is a sea lane between the [[Philippines]] and [[Japan]], [[China]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Taiwan]]. It is rich with marine resources, including the rarest sea [[coral]]s in the world.{{Which|date=May 2012}}\n\n[[File:Batanes Hills.png|thumb|right|Batanes Hills]]\n\nThe province is hilly and mountainous, with only 1,631.5 hectares or 7.1% of its area level to undulating, and 78.2% or 17,994.4 hectares varying from rolling to steep and very steep. Forty two percent (42%) or 9,734.40 hectares are steep to very steep land. Because of the terrain of the province, drainage is good and prolonged flooding is non-existent. The main island of Batan has the largest share of level and nearly level lands, followed by Itbayat and Sabtang, respectively. Itbayat has gently rolling hills and nearly level areas on semi-plateaus surrounded by continuous massive cliffs rising from {{convert|20|to(-)|70|m|ft|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]], with no shorelines. Sabtang has its small flat areas spread sporadically on its coasts, while its interior is dominated by steep mountains and deep canyons. Batan Island and Sabtang have intermittent stretches of sandy beaches and rocky shorelines.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nThe terrain of the province, while picturesque at almost every turn, has limited the potential for expansion of agriculture in an already very small province.\n\n[[File:Batanes Stone house.jpg|thumb|Batanes Stone house]]\n\n===Climate===\nBatanes has a [[tropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Am''). The average yearly temperature is {{convert|26.0|C|F|1}}, and the average monthly temperature ranges from {{convert|22.0|C|F|1}} in January to {{convert|28.5|C|F|1}} in July, similar to that of Southern Taiwan. Precipitation is abundant throughout the year; the rainiest month is August while the driest month is April. November to February are the coldest months. There is a misconception that Batanes is constantly battered by typhoons.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Batanes is mentioned frequently in connection with typhoons, because it holds the northernmost weather station in the Philippines, thus, it is also a reference point for all typhoons that enter the Philippine area; however, in September 2016, [[Typhoon Meranti (2016)|Typhoon Meranti]] impacted the entire province, including a landfall on Itbayat.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Clark|first1=Steven|title=Eye of typhoon Meranti passes over Philippines' Itbayat|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/eye-of-typhoon-meranti-passes-over-philippines-itbayat/3125510.html|accessdate=14 September 2016|work=Channel NewsAsia|date=14 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Administrative divisions===\nBatanes is subdivided into 6 [[Philippine municipality|municipalities]], all encompassed by a [[Legislative district of Batanes|lone congressional district]].\n[[File:Ph fil batanes.png|thumb|upright=0.9|{{center|Political divisions}}]]\n\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"table-layout:fixed;text-align:right;background-color:white;font-size:95%;border-collapse:collapse;margin:auto;\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n!

The northern half of the Ivatan homeland, [[Taiwan|Formosa]] and Orchid Island which were formally part of the [[New Spain|Viceroyalty of New Spain]], fell to the Dutch who were in turn expelled in 1662 by forces of the Chinese [[Southern Ming]] dynasty, led by the Chinese pirate [[Koxinga]] who then set himself up as The [[Kingdom of Tungning|King of Taiwan]].\n\nThe southern half of the Ivatan homeland, the islands of Batanes, was reinforced and fortified by Spanish refugees from Formosa before being formally joined in the 18th century with the Spanish government in Manila.\n\nThe main languages spoken in Batanes are [[Ivatan language|Ivatan]], which is spoken on the islands of Batan and Sabtang; [[Itbayaten]], which is spoken primarily on the island of Itbayat. The Ivatan which is dominant in the province is considered to be one of the [[Austronesian languages]].

Although it is reportedly growing in some other places such as coasts of [[Luzon]], [[Catanduanes]] and even [[Taiwan]], full blossoming and fruiting are observed only in Batanes. Its fruiting capacity on the island remains a mystery but is likely due to several factors such as climate, soil and type of substratum of the island.\n\nSeveral species of birds, bats, reptiles and amphibians also inhabit the island; many of those are [[endemic]] to the Philippines. The island is also a sanctuary of different [[bird migration|migratory bird]]s during winter in the [[Northern Hemisphere]].\n\n==Economy==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\nAbout 75% of the [[Ivatan people|Ivatans]] are farmers and fishermen. The rest are employed in the government and services sector. Garlic and cattle are major cash crops. Ivatans also plant ''camote'' (sweet potato), cassava, ''gabi'' or tuber and a unique variety of white uvi. Sugarcane is raised to produce ''palek'', a kind of native wine, and vinegar.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nIn recent years, fish catch has declined due to the absence of technical know-how. Employment opportunities are scarce. Most of the educated Ivatans have migrated to urban centers or have gone abroad.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nA [[Wind-Diesel Hybrid Power Systems|wind diesel]] generating plant was commissioned in 2004.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nDistance and bad weather work against its economic growth.

There are 3 flights per week from [[Manila]] by SkyJetAir, and from [[Tuguegarao]] (Cagayan) by small local airliners (as of January 2013).

The prime motivator of the cultural values of the Ivatans are imbibed in their pre-colonial belief systems of respecting [[nature]] and all people. The Ivatans, both the older and younger generations, have one of the highest incidences of social acceptance to minority groups in the country. The Ivatans also have a high respect for the elderly and the prowess of natural phenomena such as waves, sea breeze, lightning, thunders, earthquakes, and wildlife congregations. Discriminating someone based on skin color, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, and traditions on nature is unacceptable in Ivatan values. [[Land grabbing]] is also a grave crime in Ivatan societies, making ancestral domain certification an important part of Ivatan jurisprudence since the enactment of the IPRA Law. {{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Heritage==\n{{Specific section|date=June 2016}}\n\n===Natural===\n[[File:Sabtang Island, Batanes.JPG|thumb|right|White sand beach at [[Sabtang, Batanes|Sabtang]] island]]\n* ''[[Sabtang Island]]'' is undisturbed and unspoiled.

During heavy storms it was also a time for bayanihan of the residents as they helped each other tie down roofs.\n\n===Manmade===\n\n* ''Radar Tukon'' was a United States weather station on a hilltop. It offers a magnificent 360-degree view of Batan Island, the South China Sea, Mt. Iraya, Basco proper, boulder lined cliffs and the Pacific Ocean.

It is the northernmost [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] in the country, and also the smallest, both in population and land area. Its [[capital city|capital]] is [[Basco, Batanes|Basco]] located on the island of [[Batan Island|Batan]].<!--Batanes means \"Islands of batan\"-->\n\nThe island group is located approximately {{convert|162|km}} north of the [[Luzon]] mainland and about {{convert|190|km|mi|abbr=off}} south of [[Taiwan]], separated from the [[Babuyan Islands]] of [[Cagayan|Cagayan Province]] by the [[Balintang Channel]], and from Taiwan by the [[Bashi Channel]]. The entire province is listed in the [[UNESCO]] tentative list for inscription in the [[World Heritage List]]. The government has been finalizing the site's inscription, establishing museums and conservation programs since 2001. The government aims to push for the site's inclusion between 2018 and 2019. Seven intangible heritage elements of the Ivatan have been set by the Philippine government in its initial inventory in 2012. The elements are undergoing a process to be included in the [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists]] between 2018 and 2025.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Batanes'' derives from the words ''Batan'', the local word for the Ivatan people.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ivatan Man.jpg|thumb|An Ivatan holding one of many types of traditional Ivatan baskets.]]\nThe ancestors of today's Ivatans descended from Austronesians who migrated to the islands 4,000 years ago during the Neolithic period. They lived in fortified mountain areas called ''[[Batanes castles|idjangs]]'' and drank sugar-cane wine, or ''palek''. They also used gold as currency and produced a thriving agriculture-based industry. They were also seafarers and boat-builders.\n\nIn 1687, a crew of English [[Filibuster (military)|freebooters]] headed by [[William Dampier]] came with a Dutch crew and named the islands in honour of their country's nobility. Itbayat was named \"Orange Isle\" after [[William III of England|William of Orange]], and Batan was named \"Grafton Isle\" after [[Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Grafton]]. Sabtang Isle was named \"Monmouth Isle\" after [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth]]. Capt. Dampier stayed for less than three months, and did not claim the islands for the British crown.\n\nIn 1783, the Spanish claimed Batanes as part of the Philippines under the auspices of [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor-General]] [[Jos\u00e9 Basco y Vargas]]. The Bashi Channel was increasingly used by English East India Company ships and the Spanish authorities brought the islands under their direct administration to prevent them falling under British control.<ref>Howard T. Fry, \"The Eastern Passage and Its Impact on Spanish Policy in the Philippines, 1758\u20131790\", ''Philippine Studies,'' vol.33, First Quarter, 1985, pp.3\u201321, p.18.</ref> The [[Ivatan people|Ivatan]] remained on their ''[[Batanes castles|idjangs]]'', or mountain fortresses for some time. In 1790, Governor Guerrero {{Clarify|date=February 2007|reason=The Governor-general of the Philippines at this point in time is [[F\u00e9lix Berenguer de Marquina]], unless Guerrero refers to a governor of Batanes.}} decreed that Ivatans were to live in the lowlands and leave their remote ''idjang''. The mangpus, the indigenous Ivatan leader of the islands during that time, made a revolution against the Spaniards afterwards. With much ammunition and steel armors, the Spanish authorities quelled the uprising, effectively subjugating the rebels. Basco and Ivana were the first towns established under full Spanish control. Mahatao was then administered by Basco, while Uyugan and Sabtang, by Ivana. Itbayat was not organized until the 1850s, its coast being a ridge. Soon, Ilocanos came to the islands and integrated with the local population. Roads, ports, bridges, churches and government buildings were built in this time. Limestone technology used by the Spanish was also spread to the islands, making bridges strong and fortified. Some of these bridges still remain at Ivana and Mahatao. By 1890, many Ivatans were in Manila, and became ''ilustrados'', who then brought home with them the revolutionary ideas of the [[Katipunan]]. These Ivatans, who were then discontented with Spanish rule, killed the ruling General Fortea and declared the end of Spanish rule.\n\nToward the end of the Spanish administration, Batanes was made a part of Cagayan. In 1909, the new American authorities organized it into an independent province. During the American colonial period, additional public schools were constructed and more Ivatan became aware of their place in the Philippines. In 1920, the first wireless telegraph was installed, followed by an airfield in 1930. New roads were constructed and the Batanes High School was instituted.\n\nBecause of their strategic location, the islands was one of the first points occupied by invading Japanese imperial forces at the outbreak of the [[World War II|Pacific War]]. The morning of December 8, 1941, the Batan Task Force from [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Taiwan]] landed on the Batan Islands, which became the first American territory occupied by the Japanese. The purpose of the invasion was to secure the existing small airfield outside Basco, which was accomplished without resistance. Japanese fighters from Basco took part in the raid on [[History of Clark Air Base|Clark Air Base]] the following day. However, over the next several days, the success of the Japanese bombing of Clark Field rendered a base at Basco unnecessary, and on December 10, 1941, the naval combat force was withdrawn to participate in the [[Japanese invasion of Camiguin Island|invasion of Camiguin]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The First Landings|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-P-PI/USA-P-PI-6.html|accessdate=18 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nOne of the first School Superintendents on Batan was [[Victor de Padua]], an Ilocano, who in 1942\u201345 during the Japanese occupation was made Provincial Governor. Early in 1945 the island was liberated by the Philippine Commonwealth forces of the 1st and 12th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army. In 1984, [[Pacita Abad]], the foremost Ivatan visual artist, became the first woman to be awarded the Ten Outstanding Young Men (TOYM) award, breaking 25 years of male dominance. In her acceptance speech, she said, \"it was long overdue that Filipina women were recognized, as the Philippines was full of outstanding women\u201d and referred proudly to her mother.<ref>https://www.pacitaabad.com/Activities/Awards.php</ref>\n[[File:Oldest House in Ivatan.jpg|thumb|A ''Sinadumparan'' Ivatan house, one of the oldest structures in the Batanes islands. The house is made of [[limestone]] and [[coral]] and its roofing of [[Imperata cylindrica|cogon grass]].]]\nIn 1993, the Batanes Protected Landscape and Seascape, which encompassed the entire province, was listed in the Tentative List of the Philippines for [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] inscription in the future.<ref>https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/521/</ref> In 1997, the Indigenous Peoples Rights act or IPRA was passed in Philippine Congress. the law paved the way for the indigenous territorial rights of the Ivatans. The province has since promoted its Ivatan roots. Part of the Ilocano population has returned to mainland Luzon. In December 7, 2004, [[Pacita Abad]] died after finishing her last international art work while suffering from cancer.<ref>http://www.artnet.com/artists/pacita-abad/biography</ref>\n\n{{Back to contents}}\n\n==Geography==\n\nThe province has a total area of {{convert|{{PH wikidata|area}}|km2}}{{PSGC detail|nscb}} comprising ten islands situated within the [[Luzon Strait]] between the Balintang Channel and [[Taiwan]]. The islands are sparsely populated and subject to frequent typhoons. The three largest islands, [[Batan Island|Batan]], [[Itbayat Island|Itbayat]], and [[Sabtang Island|Sabtang]], are the only inhabited islands.\n\nThe northernmost island in the province, also the northernmost land in the entire Philippines, is [[Mavulis Island|Mavulis (or Y'ami) Island]]. Other islands in the chain are Misanga (or North), Ditarem, [[Siayan Island|Siayan]], Diogo (or Dinem), [[Ivuhos]], and [[Dequey]]. The islands are part of the [[Luzon Volcanic Arc]].\n\n===Topography===\nAlmost one-half of Batanes is [[hill]]s and [[mountain]]s. [[Batan Island]] is generally mountainous on the north and southeast. It has a basin in the interior. [[Itbayat Island]] slopes gradually to the west, being mountainous and hilly along its northern, eastern coast. As for Sabtang, mountains cover the central part, making the island slope outward to the coast.\n\nThe islands are situated between the vast expanse of the waters of [[Bashi Channel]] and [[Balintang Channel]], where the Pacific Ocean merges with the China Sea. The area is a sea lane between the [[Philippines]] and [[Japan]], [[China]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Taiwan]]. It is rich with marine resources, including the rarest sea [[coral]]s in the world.{{Which|date=May 2012}}\n\n[[File:Batanes Hills.png|thumb|right|Batanes Hills]]\n\nThe province is hilly and mountainous, with only 1,631.5 hectares or 7.1% of its area level to undulating, and 78.2% or 17,994.4 hectares varying from rolling to steep and very steep. Forty two percent (42%) or 9,734.40 hectares are steep to very steep land. Because of the terrain of the province, drainage is good and prolonged flooding is non-existent. The main island of Batan has the largest share of level and nearly level lands, followed by Itbayat and Sabtang, respectively. Itbayat has gently rolling hills and nearly level areas on semi-plateaus surrounded by continuous massive cliffs rising from {{convert|20|to(-)|70|m|ft|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]], with no shorelines. Sabtang has its small flat areas spread sporadically on its coasts, while its interior is dominated by steep mountains and deep canyons. Batan Island and Sabtang have intermittent stretches of sandy beaches and rocky shorelines.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nThe terrain of the province, while picturesque at almost every turn, has limited the potential for expansion of agriculture in an already very small province.\n\n[[File:Batanes Stone house.jpg|thumb|Batanes Stone house]]\n\n===Climate===\nBatanes has a [[tropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Am''). The average yearly temperature is {{convert|26.0|C|F|1}}, and the average monthly temperature ranges from {{convert|22.0|C|F|1}} in January to {{convert|28.5|C|F|1}} in July, similar to that of Southern Taiwan. Precipitation is abundant throughout the year; the rainiest month is August while the driest month is April. November to February are the coldest months. There is a misconception that Batanes is constantly battered by typhoons.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Batanes is mentioned frequently in connection with typhoons, because it holds the northernmost weather station in the Philippines, thus, it is also a reference point for all typhoons that enter the Philippine area; however, in September 2016, [[Typhoon Meranti (2016)|Typhoon Meranti]] impacted the entire province, including a landfall on Itbayat.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Clark|first1=Steven|title=Eye of typhoon Meranti passes over Philippines' Itbayat|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/eye-of-typhoon-meranti-passes-over-philippines-itbayat/3125510.html|accessdate=14 September 2016|work=Channel NewsAsia|date=14 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Administrative divisions===\nBatanes is subdivided into 6 [[Philippine municipality|municipalities]], all encompassed by a [[Legislative district of Batanes|lone congressional district]].\n[[File:Ph fil batanes.png|thumb|upright=0.9|{{center|Political divisions}}]]\n\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"table-layout:fixed;text-align:right;background-color:white;font-size:95%;border-collapse:collapse;margin:auto;\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n!

The northern half of the Ivatan homeland, [[Taiwan|Formosa]] and Orchid Island which were formally part of the [[New Spain|Viceroyalty of New Spain]], fell to the Dutch who were in turn expelled in 1662 by forces of the Chinese [[Southern Ming]] dynasty, led by the Chinese pirate [[Koxinga]] who then set himself up as The [[Kingdom of Tungning|King of Taiwan]].\n\nThe southern half of the Ivatan homeland, the islands of Batanes, was reinforced and fortified by Spanish refugees from Formosa before being formally joined in the 18th century with the Spanish government in Manila.\n\nThe main languages spoken in Batanes are [[Ivatan language|Ivatan]], which is spoken on the islands of Batan and Sabtang; [[Itbayaten]], which is spoken primarily on the island of Itbayat. The Ivatan which is dominant in the province is considered to be one of the [[Austronesian languages]]. From college level down to elementary level, the language is widely spoken.<ref>[http://www.batanesonline.com/LiteraryArts/IvatanLanguage.htm www.BatanesOnline.com<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212194455/http://www.batanesonline.com/LiteraryArts/IvatanLanguage.htm |date=2007-12-12 }}</ref>\n\n===Religion===\nThe large majority (94%) of the island's people adhere to [[Roman Catholicism in the Philippines|Roman Catholicism]]. The remaining faiths are other Christian Churches.\n\n==Ecology==\n[[File:Goats in Batanes.png|thumb|Livestock freely roaming in the green hills in Batanes]]\n\nAn extensive survey of the [[ecology]] of Batanes<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quantum-conservation.org/BatanesSurvey20082.htm|title=Final Report Batanes Biodiversity Survey<!-- Bot generated title -->|website=quantum-conservation.org|accessdate=31 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113171159/http://www.quantum-conservation.org/BatanesSurvey20082.htm|archive-date=13 January 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> provided the scientific basis for confirming the need for a national park in Batanes protecting the Batanes protected landscapes and seascapes, proposed as a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]], submitted on 15 August 1993.

Although it is reportedly growing in some other places such as coasts of [[Luzon]], [[Catanduanes]] and even [[Taiwan]], full blossoming and fruiting are observed only in Batanes. Its fruiting capacity on the island remains a mystery but is likely due to several factors such as climate, soil and type of substratum of the island.\n\nSeveral species of birds, bats, reptiles and amphibians also inhabit the island; many of those are [[endemic]] to the Philippines. The island is also a sanctuary of different [[bird migration|migratory bird]]s during winter in the [[Northern Hemisphere]].\n\n==Economy==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\nAbout 75% of the [[Ivatan people|Ivatans]] are farmers and fishermen. The rest are employed in the government and services sector. Garlic and cattle are major cash crops. Ivatans also plant ''camote'' (sweet potato), cassava, ''gabi'' or tuber and a unique variety of white uvi. Sugarcane is raised to produce ''palek'', a kind of native wine, and vinegar.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nIn recent years, fish catch has declined due to the absence of technical know-how. Employment opportunities are scarce. Most of the educated Ivatans have migrated to urban centers or have gone abroad.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nA [[Wind-Diesel Hybrid Power Systems|wind diesel]] generating plant was commissioned in 2004.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nDistance and bad weather work against its economic growth. Certain commodities like rice, soft drinks, and gasoline carry a 75% to 100% mark-up over Manila retail prices.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Transportation==\nThe island province of Batanes is accessible by air via the [[Basco Airport]] and [[Itbayat Airport]]. There are 3 flights per week from [[Manila]] by SkyJetAir, and from [[Tuguegarao]] (Cagayan) by small local airliners (as of January 2013). [[PAL Express]] flies to Batanes every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday since May 1, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pinoyadventurista.com/2013/02/airphil-express-to-launch-manila-batanes-flights-on-may.html|title=Airphil Express flies Manila to Basco (Batanes) starting May 2013|author=|date=|website=pinoyadventurista.com|accessdate=31 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Values==\nThe Ivatan people of Batanes are one of the most [[egalitarian]] societies in the Philippines. The prime motivator of the cultural values of the Ivatans are imbibed in their pre-colonial belief systems of respecting [[nature]] and all people. The Ivatans, both the older and younger generations, have one of the highest incidences of social acceptance to minority groups in the country. The Ivatans also have a high respect for the elderly and the prowess of natural phenomena such as waves, sea breeze, lightning, thunders, earthquakes, and wildlife congregations. Discriminating someone based on skin color, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, and traditions on nature is unacceptable in Ivatan values. [[Land grabbing]] is also a grave crime in Ivatan societies, making ancestral domain certification an important part of Ivatan jurisprudence since the enactment of the IPRA Law. {{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Heritage==\n{{Specific section|date=June 2016}}\n\n===Natural===\n[[File:Sabtang Island, Batanes.JPG|thumb|right|White sand beach at [[Sabtang, Batanes|Sabtang]] island]]\n* ''[[Sabtang Island]]'' is undisturbed and unspoiled. It has intermittent white sand beaches with steep mountains and deep canyons with small level areas sporadically found along the coastline. Southwest of Batan Island, Sabtang is accessible by 30-minute falowa ride from Radiwan Port in Ivana. Sabtang Island is also the take off point for [[Ivuhos]] Island from Barangay Nakanmuan.\n* ''[[Itbayat Island]]'' is located north of Batan Island. Itbayat is shaped like a giant bowl. The island is surrounded by massive boulders and cliffs rising from {{convert|20|to(-)|70|ft|m|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]] and has no shoreline. It has a dirt airstrip for light aircraft.

It is {{convert|8|km|mi|spell=in|abbr=off}} from Basco.\n* ''White Beach'' at Vatang, Hapnit and Mavatuy Point, all in Mahatao.\n* ''Storm-proof'' Stone houses in Batanes many residents during typhoon made up their already-fortified houses with wood and secured the roofs with nets and ropes. This was done to ensure that the structures\u2014which symbolize the Ivatan's strength and resilience against disasters\u2014outlast the high-pressure winds of typhoon that is expected to unleash. Tapangkos or covering were also installed on the doors and windows of several buildings in Batanes, including the capitol building. During heavy storms it was also a time for bayanihan of the residents as they helped each other tie down roofs.\n\n===Manmade===\n\n* ''Radar Tukon'' was a United States weather station on a hilltop. It offers a magnificent 360-degree view of Batan Island, the South China Sea, Mt. Iraya, Basco proper, boulder lined cliffs and the Pacific Ocean.

Trials on various prototypes based on the [[AKM]] were carried out by the [[Armament Research and Development Establishment]] (ARDE) in [[Pune]]. On the completion of the trial, The Indian Small Arms System (INSAS) was adopted in 1990. However, to phase out  the still in use bolt-action [[Lee\u2013Enfield]] rifles as quickly as possible, India had to acquire 100,000 7.62\u00d739mm AKM-type rifles from Russia, Hungary, Romania and Israel in 1990\u201392.<ref name=\"Walter2006\">{{cite book|author=John Walter|title=Rifles of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Eq2Dnj4sDZIC&pg=PA210|accessdate=28 May 2014|date=25 March 2006|publisher=Krause Publications|isbn=0-89689-241-7|pages=209\u2013210|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140708204553/http://books.google.com/books?id=Eq2Dnj4sDZIC&pg=PA210|archive-date=8 July 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOriginally, three variants were planned in the INSAS system, a [[rifle]], a [[carbine]] and a [[squad automatic weapon]] (SAW) or [[Light machine gun]] (LMG).

It can fire a three-round [[Burst mode (weapon)|burst]] or in semi-automatic mode. The cyclic rate averages at 650 rpm. The transparent plastic magazine was adapted from the [[Steyr AUG]]. The rear [[Iron sights|sight]] lies on one end of the [[Breechblock|breech cover]] and is calibrated to 400 meters. The furniture is either made for wood or polymer.<ref name=\"Cutshaw2011\"/> The polymer [[Stock (firearms)|butt]] and forend assemblies differ from the AKM and are more similar to that of [[IMI Galil]]. Some variants have a folding butt. A [[bayonet]] can also be attached to it.<ref name=\"Walter2006\"/> The guns take 20- or 30-round polymer magazines.

The basic gas operated [[Gas-operated reloading#Long-stroke piston|long stroke piston]] and the [[rotating bolt]] are similar to the [[AKM]]/[[AK-47]].<ref name=\"Cutshaw2011\"/>\n\n[[File:Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry (JAK LI) soldier.jpg|thumb|A [[Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry|JAK LI soldier]] guarding the [[India Gate]] with INSAS rifle.]]\n[[File:INSAS RIFLE.jpg|thumb|An Indian soldier uniform with the INSAS rifle.]]\n\nIt has a manual gas regulator, similar to that of [[FN FAL]], and a gas cutoff for launching grenades.

It can fire a three-round [[Burst mode (weapon)|burst]] or in semi-automatic mode. The cyclic rate averages at 650 rpm. The transparent plastic magazine was adapted from the [[Steyr AUG]]. The rear [[Iron sights|sight]] lies on one end of the [[Breechblock|breech cover]] and is calibrated to 400 meters. The furniture is either made for wood or polymer.<ref name=\"Cutshaw2011\"/> The polymer [[Stock (firearms)|butt]] and forend assemblies differ from the AKM and are more similar to that of [[IMI Galil]].

One of the strongest recommendations of the report was: \"The first priority for government action on domestic violence should be the establishment of a central, co-ordinated policy for refuge provision throughout the country. We believe that this could well be the single greatest cost-saving measure that could be taken\".

Influenced by evidence from Southall Black Sisters the report also raised awareness of the problems of domestic servants who faced deportation if they complained about being abused and this later led to changes in the immigration rules when Mike O\u2019Brien became Immigration Minister.<ref>Home Truths About Domestic Violence: Feminist Influences on Policy and Practice - A Reader Jalna Hanmwer Catherine Itzin</ref>\n\nMike O'Brien introduced a Private Members Bill on 21 April 1993, the Criminal Justice Amendment (No.2) Bill, to allow previous convictions to be taken into account when sentencing a convicted person.

He criticised the cabinet secretary for allowing himself to be used to investigate whether a Minister Secretary Jonathan Aitken had stayed at a Paris Hotel. \u201cSir Robin was, at best, ill qualified to undertake any such investigation, as he did not in any previous incarnation have experience of being a policeman, a private investigator or a barrister trained in interrogation.

Once admitted they will have to show that the relationship has subsisted for a further year before being granted settlement''\".
