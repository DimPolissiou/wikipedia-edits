The [[Old English language|Old English]] name was \"Earninga Straete\" (1012), named after a tribe called the ''Earningas'', who inhabited a district later known as ''Armingford Hundred'', around [[Arrington, Cambridgeshire]] and [[Royston, Hertfordshire]].<ref>P.H.Blair, ''An Introduction to Anglo-Saxon England'' (Cambridge,2003),p.256</ref> \"Armingford\", and \"Arrington\" share the same Old English origin. The original [[Common Brittonic|Celtic]] and [[Latin language|Roman]] names for the route remain unknown. It is also known as the '''Old North Road''' from London to where it joins the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]] [[Great North Road (United Kingdom)|Great North Road]] near [[Godmanchester]].\n\n==Course==\nErmine Street begins at [[Bishopsgate]], where one of the seven gates in the wall surrounding [[Roman London]] was located. From here it runs north up [[Norton Folgate]], [[Shoreditch High Street]] and [[Kingsland Road]] through [[Stoke Newington]] (forming Stoke Newington Road and Stoke Newington High Street), [[Tottenham]], [[Edmonton, London|Edmonton]] and Eastern [[London Borough of Enfield|Enfield]] (Ponders End, Enfield Highway, Enfield Wash and Freezywater) to [[Royston, Hertfordshire|Royston]]. This section of Ermine Street from [[London]] to Royston is now largely part of the [[A10 road (Great Britain)|A10]]. At this point it crosses the [[Icknield Way]].  From Royston, it was formerly the [[A14 road (Great Britain)|A14]] to the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]] but now it is the [[A1198 road|A1198]] to [[Godmanchester]] (''Durovigutum''). Ignoring bypasses and modern diversions, the road through [[Huntingdon]] to the Alconbury junction on the A1 gives the line. The section from [[Alconbury]] to [[Water Newton]], ignoring modern bypasses such as that at [[Stilton]], follows the A1. Ermine street used to pass through ''[[Durobrivae (Water Newton)|Durobrivae]]'', the slight remains of which can be seen to the east, alongside the A1 at Peterborough. The modern road returns to Ermine Street north-west of [[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]], near [[Great Casterton]], through which Ermine Street ran.\n\nThe post-Roman road wandered off for two and half miles ({{convert|2.5|mi|abbr=out|disp=output only}}) through [[Colsterworth]], but Ermine Street continues as the B6403, through [[Ancaster, Lincolnshire|Ancaster]]  to the [[A17 road (Great Britain)|A17]].

The route from Colsterworth, through Ancaster, to Bracebridge Heath is known as [[High Dyke, Lincolnshire|High Dike]]. It runs roughly parallel with and to the east of the A607 between [[Carlton Scroop]] and [[Harmston]]. High Dike takes to the level, open, dry country of the [[Lincolnshire]] Heath while the A607 wanders through the villages on the [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] line below.  From the [[Antonine Itinerary]] there is known to have been a Roman Settlement on the road in South Lincolnshire, called  ''[[Causennae]]'' which has been variously identified with [[Ancaster Roman Town]] or [[Little Ponton and Stroxton|Saltersford, south of Grantham]].<ref name=PS1>{{cite PastScape|mnumber=325760|mname=|accessdate=15 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Whitewell|first=J.B.|title=Roman Lincolnshire|publisher=Lincolnshire local history society|pages=64, 65|year=1970|series=History of Lincolnshire|volume=2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Ivan D. |last=Margary |title=Roman Roads in Britain |publisher=John Baker |location=London |year=1967}}</ref>\n\nAnother long section remains, now the [[A15 road (Great Britain)|A15]], running north out of Lincoln, past [[RAF Scampton]] and [[Caenby]] Corner, past [[Kirton in Lindsey]] at grid reference SE9698, and continuing almost to the [[Humber]] at [[Winteringham]]. Before the diversion was made round the extended runway at Scampton, with a very slight diversion at [[Broughton, Lincolnshire|Broughton]], it was possible to travel about 33 miles, from the Newport Arch, the Roman north gate at Lincoln, to the [[Parish]] of Winteringham along a road so slightly curved as to be regarded as straight.\n\nRoman Winteringham was the terminal for the ferry to ''[[Petuaria]]'' ([[Brough, East Riding of Yorkshire|Brough]]) on the north shore of the Humber.

The son of [[John, King of England|King John]] and [[Isabella of Angoul\u00eame]], Henry assumed the throne when he was only nine in the middle of the [[First Barons' War]]. [[Cardinal Guala]] declared the war against the rebel barons to be a religious crusade and Henry's forces, led by [[William Marshal]], defeated the rebels at the battles of [[Battle of Lincoln (1217)|Lincoln]] and [[Battle of Sandwich (1217)|Sandwich]] in 1217. Henry promised to abide by the [[Magna Carta#Great Charter of 1225|Great Charter of 1225]], which limited royal power and protected the rights of the major barons.<!--Note: the 1225 date is correct in this context, and shouldn't be confused with the 1215 charter--> His early rule was dominated first by [[Hubert de Burgh]] and then [[Peter des Roches]], who re-established royal authority after the war. In 1230, the King attempted to reconquer the [[Angevin Empire|provinces of France]] that had once belonged to his father, but [[English invasion of France (1230)|the invasion]] was a debacle. A revolt led by William Marshal's son, [[Richard Marshal]], broke out in 1232, ending in a peace settlement negotiated by [[Catholic Church|the Church]].\n\nFollowing the revolt, Henry ruled England personally, rather than governing through senior ministers. He travelled less than previous monarchs, investing heavily in a handful of his favourite [[Castles in Great Britain and Ireland#Palace-fortresses|palaces and castles]]. He married [[Eleanor of Provence]], with whom he had five children. Henry was known for his [[piety]], holding lavish religious ceremonies and giving generously to charities; the King was particularly devoted to the figure of [[Edward the Confessor]], whom he adopted as his [[patron saint]]. He extracted huge sums of money from the [[Jews in England]], ultimately crippling their ability to do business, and as attitudes towards the Jews hardened, he introduced the [[Statute of Jewry]], attempting to segregate the community. In a fresh attempt to reclaim his family's lands in France, he [[Saintonge War|invaded Poitou]] in 1242, leading to the disastrous [[Battle of Taillebourg]]. After this, Henry relied on diplomacy, cultivating an alliance with [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Henry supported his brother [[Richard of Cornwall]] in his bid to become [[King of the Romans]] in 1256, but was unable to place his own son [[Edmund Crouchback]] on the throne of [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]], despite investing large amounts of money. He planned to go on [[crusade]] to the [[Levant]], but was prevented from doing so by rebellions in [[Gascony]].\n\nBy 1258, Henry's rule was increasingly unpopular, the result of the failure of his expensive foreign policies and the notoriety of his [[Poitiers|Poitevin]] half-brothers, the [[Lusignans]], as well as the role of his local officials in collecting taxes and debts. A coalition of his barons, initially probably backed by Eleanor, seized power in a coup d'\u00e9tat and expelled the Poitevins from England, reforming the royal government through a process called the [[Provisions of Oxford]]. Henry and the baronial government enacted a [[Treaty of Paris (1259)|peace with France]] in 1259, under which Henry gave up his rights to his other lands in France in return for [[King Louis IX]] recognising him as the rightful ruler of Gascony. The baronial regime collapsed but Henry was unable to reform a stable government and instability across England continued.\n\nIn 1263, one of the more radical barons, [[Simon de Montfort]], seized power, resulting in the [[Second Barons' War]]. Henry persuaded Louis to support his cause and mobilised an army. The [[Battle of Lewes]] occurred in 1264, where Henry was defeated and taken prisoner. Henry's eldest son, [[Edward I of England|Edward]], escaped from captivity to defeat de Montfort at the [[Battle of Evesham]] the following year and freed his father. Henry initially enacted a harsh revenge on the remaining rebels, but was persuaded by the Church to mollify his policies through the [[Dictum of Kenilworth]].

[[Cardinal Guala]] declared the war against the rebel barons to be a religious crusade and Henry's forces, led by [[William Marshal]], defeated the rebels at the battles of [[Battle of Lincoln (1217)|Lincoln]] and [[Battle of Sandwich (1217)|Sandwich]] in 1217. Henry promised to abide by the [[Magna Carta#Great Charter of 1225|Great Charter of 1225]], which limited royal power and protected the rights of the major barons.<!--Note: the 1225 date is correct in this context, and shouldn't be confused with the 1215 charter--> His early rule was dominated first by [[Hubert de Burgh]] and then [[Peter des Roches]], who re-established royal authority after the war. In 1230, the King attempted to reconquer the [[Angevin Empire|provinces of France]] that had once belonged to his father, but [[English invasion of France (1230)|the invasion]] was a debacle. A revolt led by William Marshal's son, [[Richard Marshal]], broke out in 1232, ending in a peace settlement negotiated by [[Catholic Church|the Church]].\n\nFollowing the revolt, Henry ruled England personally, rather than governing through senior ministers. He travelled less than previous monarchs, investing heavily in a handful of his favourite [[Castles in Great Britain and Ireland#Palace-fortresses|palaces and castles]]. He married [[Eleanor of Provence]], with whom he had five children. Henry was known for his [[piety]], holding lavish religious ceremonies and giving generously to charities; the King was particularly devoted to the figure of [[Edward the Confessor]], whom he adopted as his [[patron saint]]. He extracted huge sums of money from the [[Jews in England]], ultimately crippling their ability to do business, and as attitudes towards the Jews hardened, he introduced the [[Statute of Jewry]], attempting to segregate the community. In a fresh attempt to reclaim his family's lands in France, he [[Saintonge War|invaded Poitou]] in 1242, leading to the disastrous [[Battle of Taillebourg]]. After this, Henry relied on diplomacy, cultivating an alliance with [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Henry supported his brother [[Richard of Cornwall]] in his bid to become [[King of the Romans]] in 1256, but was unable to place his own son [[Edmund Crouchback]] on the throne of [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]], despite investing large amounts of money. He planned to go on [[crusade]] to the [[Levant]], but was prevented from doing so by rebellions in [[Gascony]].\n\nBy 1258, Henry's rule was increasingly unpopular, the result of the failure of his expensive foreign policies and the notoriety of his [[Poitiers|Poitevin]] half-brothers, the [[Lusignans]], as well as the role of his local officials in collecting taxes and debts. A coalition of his barons, initially probably backed by Eleanor, seized power in a coup d'\u00e9tat and expelled the Poitevins from England, reforming the royal government through a process called the [[Provisions of Oxford]]. Henry and the baronial government enacted a [[Treaty of Paris (1259)|peace with France]] in 1259, under which Henry gave up his rights to his other lands in France in return for [[King Louis IX]] recognising him as the rightful ruler of Gascony. The baronial regime collapsed but Henry was unable to reform a stable government and instability across England continued.\n\nIn 1263, one of the more radical barons, [[Simon de Montfort]], seized power, resulting in the [[Second Barons' War]]. Henry persuaded Louis to support his cause and mobilised an army. The [[Battle of Lewes]] occurred in 1264, where Henry was defeated and taken prisoner. Henry's eldest son, [[Edward I of England|Edward]], escaped from captivity to defeat de Montfort at the [[Battle of Evesham]] the following year and freed his father. Henry initially enacted a harsh revenge on the remaining rebels, but was persuaded by the Church to mollify his policies through the [[Dictum of Kenilworth]]. Reconstruction was slow and Henry had to acquiesce to various measures, including further suppression of the Jews, to maintain baronial and popular support. Henry died in 1272, leaving Edward as his successor. He was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]], which he had rebuilt in the second half of his reign, and was moved to his current tomb in 1290. Some [[miracle]]s were declared after his death; however, he was not [[canonised]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Background and childhood==\n{{main|Angevin Empire|First Barons' War}}\n[[File:Angevin empire in France c. 1200 (simplified).png|thumb|alt=A coloured map of medieval France, showing the Angevin territories in France|King [[John of England|John]]'s lands in France, c. 1200]]\nHenry was born in [[Winchester Castle]] on 1 October 1207.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|2013|pp=45\u201346}}</ref> He was the eldest son of [[John, King of England|King John]] and [[Isabella of Angoul\u00eame]].<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|2013|p=45}}</ref> Little is known of Henry's early life.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|2013|p=46}}; {{harvnb|Cole|2002|p=230}}</ref> He was initially looked after by a [[wet nurse]] called Ellen in the south of England, away from John's itinerant court, and probably had close ties to his mother.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|2013|p=46}}; {{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |title=Henry III (1207\u20131272) |website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, online edition |publication-date=September 2010 |year=2004 |last=Ridgeway |first=Huw W. |accessdate=17 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053239/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |archivedate=21 September 2013 |mode=cs2 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/12950 |publisher=Oxford University Press |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Henry had four legitimate younger brothers and sisters \u2013 [[Richard of Cornwall|Richard]], [[Joan of England, Queen of Scotland|Joan]], [[Isabella of England|Isabella]] and [[Eleanor of England, Countess of Leicester|Eleanor]] \u2013 and various older illegitimate siblings.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|2013|p=47}}</ref> In 1212 his education was entrusted to [[Peter des Roches]], the [[Bishop of Winchester]]; under his direction, Henry was given military training by Philip D'Aubigny and taught to ride, probably by Ralph of St Samson.<ref name=ODNB>{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |title=Henry III (1207\u20131272) |website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, online edition |publication-date=September 2010 |year=2004 |last=Ridgeway |first=Huw W. |accessdate=17 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053239/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |archivedate=21 September 2013 |mode=cs2 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/12950 |publisher=Oxford University Press |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nLittle is known about Henry's appearance; he was probably around {{convert|1.68|m}} tall, and accounts recorded after his death suggested that he had a strong build, with a [[Ptosis (eyelid)|drooping eyelid]].<ref name=ODNB/>{{efn|The description of Henry's eyelid, written after his death, comes from the chronicler [[Nicholas Trevet]].

Henry David Thoreau (1817\u20131862), uno de los escritores pr\u00f3ximos al movimiento de la filosof\u00eda trascendentalista, es uno de los m\u00e1s conocidos. Su obra m\u00e1s representativa es Walden, aparecida en 1854, aunque redactada entre 1845 y 1847, cuando Thoreau decide instalarse en el aislamiento de una caba\u00f1a en el bosque, y vivir en \u00edntimo contacto con la naturaleza, en una vida de soledad y sobriedad. De esta experiencia, su filosof\u00eda trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armon\u00eda de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por Jonh Zerzan. Para George Woodcock, esta actitud puede estar tambi\u00e9n motivada por una cierta idea de resistencia al progreso y de rechazo al materialismo creciente que caracteriza la sociedad norteamericana de mediados de siglo XIX.\"[http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf \"Voluntary non-submission.

The second type is the amoral self-serving rationality of [[Egoist anarchism|egoism]] as most associated with [[Max Stirner]]. The third type is \"found in [[Herbert Spencer]]'s early predictions, and in that of some of his disciples such as [[Wordsworth Donisthorpe]], foreseeing the redundancy of the state in the source of social evolution\". The fourth type retains a moderated form of egoism and accounts for social cooperation through the advocacy of market relationships.<ref name=\"Freeden, Michael pp. 313\u2013314\"/> Individualist anarchism of different kinds have a few things in common. These are the following:\n# The concentration on the [[individual]] and their will in preference to any construction such as morality, ideology, social custom, religion, metaphysics, ideas or the will of others.<ref name=\"individualism\">\"En la vida de todo \u00fanico, todo v\u00ednculo, independientemente de la forma en que \u00e9ste se presente, supone una cadena que condiciona, y por tanto elimina la condici\u00f3n de persona libre.

First amongst these is the abstraction \"Man\", into which all unique individuals are submerged and lost. As he put it, \"liberalism is a religion because it separates my essence from me and sets it above me, because it exalts 'Man' to the same extent as any other religion does to God ... it sets me beneath Man.\" Indeed, he \"who is infatuated with Man leaves persons out of account so far as that infatuation extends, and floats in an ideal, sacred interest.

Greene]] introduced Proudhon's works to the United States. Greene adapted Proudhon's mutualism to American conditions and introduced it to [[Benjamin Tucker]].<ref>Tucker, Benjamin R., \"On Picket Duty\", ''Liberty (Not the Daughter but the Mother of Order)'' (1881\u20131908); 5 January 1889; 6, 10; APS Online p. 1</ref>\n\nProudhon opposed government privilege that protects capitalist, banking and land interests and the accumulation or acquisition of property (and any form of [[coercion]] that led to it) which he believed hampers competition and keeps wealth in the hands of the few. Proudhon favoured a right of individuals to retain the product of their labour as their own property, but believed that any property beyond that which an individual produced and could possess was illegitimate. Thus he saw private property as both essential to liberty and a road to tyranny, the former when it resulted from labour and was required for labour and the latter when it resulted in exploitation (profit, interest, rent and tax). He generally called the former \"possession\" and the latter \"property\". For large-scale industry, he supported workers associations to replace wage labour and opposed the ownership of land.\n\nProudhon maintained that those who labour should retain the entirety of what they produce and that [[monopoly|monopolies]] on credit and land are the forces that prohibit such. He advocated an economic system that included private property as possession and exchange market, but without profit, which he called [[mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]]. It is Proudhon's philosophy that was explicitly rejected by [[Joseph Dejacque]] in the inception of anarcho-communism, with the latter asserting directly to Proudhon in a letter that \"it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature\". An individualist rather than anarcho-communist,<ref name=\"Encyclopedia Americana\"/><ref name=\"Hamilton 1995 79\"/><ref name=\"Faguet 1970 147\"/> Proudhon said that \"communism ... is the very denial of society in its foundation\"<ref>Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph.

BiblioBazaar, LLC (2006). {{ISBN|1-4264-0908-7}} p. 217</ref> and famously declared that \"[[property is theft]]!\" in reference to his rejection of ownership rights to land being granted to a person who is not using that land.\n\nAfter Dejacque and others split from Proudhon due to the latter's support of individual property and an exchange economy, the relationship between the individualists (who continued in relative alignment with the philosophy of Proudhon) and the anarcho-communists was characterised by various degrees of antagonism and harmony. For example, individualists like Tucker on the one hand translated and reprinted the works of [[collectivist anarchism|collectivists]] like [[Mikhail Bakunin]] while on the other hand rejected the economic aspects of collectivism and communism as incompatible with anarchist ideals.\n\n==== Mutualism ====\n{{socialism sidebar}}\n{{main|Mutualism (economic theory)}}\nMutualism is an [[anarchist school of thought]] which can be traced to the writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, who envisioned a society where each person might possess a [[means of production]], either individually or collectively, with trade representing equivalent amounts of labor in the [[free market]].<ref>[http://www.mutualist.org/ Mutualist.org Introduction]</ref> Integral to the scheme was the establishment of a mutual-credit bank which would lend to producers at a minimal interest rate only high enough to cover the costs of administration.<ref>Miller, David. 1987. \"Mutualism.\" The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Political Thought.

Thoreau was an American author, poet, naturalist, tax resister, [[Development criticism|development critic]], surveyor, historian, philosopher and leading [[transcendentalist]]. He is best known for his book ''[[Walden]]'', a reflection upon [[simple living]] in natural surroundings; and his essay, ''[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]'', an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state. His thought is an early influence on [[green anarchism]], but with an emphasis on the individual experience of the natural world influencing later [[Anarcho-naturism|naturist]] currents,<ref name=\"thoreau\"/> [[simple living]] as a rejection of a [[Economic materialism|materialist]] lifestyle<ref name=thoreau/> and self-sufficiency were Thoreau's goals and the whole project was inspired by transcendentalist philosophy. Many have seen in Thoreau one of the precursors of ecologism and [[anarcho-primitivism]] represented today in [[John Zerzan]]. For [[George Woodcock]], this attitude can be also motivated by certain idea of resistance to progress and of rejection of the growing materialism which is the nature of American society in the mid 19th century.<ref name=\"naturismo\"/>\n\nThe essay [[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]] (''Resistance to Civil Government'') was first published in 1849. It argues that people should not permit governments to overrule or atrophy their consciences and that people have a duty to avoid allowing such [[acquiescence]] to enable the government to make them the agents of injustice. Thoreau was motivated in part by his disgust with slavery and the [[Mexican\u2013American War]].

This rejection galvanized the movement into fierce debates, with the natural rights proponents accusing the egoists of destroying libertarianism itself. So bitter was the conflict that a number of natural rights proponents withdrew from the pages of ''Liberty'' in protest even though they had hitherto been among its frequent contributors. Thereafter, ''Liberty'' championed egoism although its general content did not change significantly.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DdHseFmQiSUC Wendy Mcelroy. \"Benjamin Tucker, Individualism, & Liberty: Not the Daughter but the Mother of Order\"]</ref>\n\nSeveral periodicals were undoubtedly influenced by ''Liberty'''s presentation of egoism.

Henry David Thoreau (1817\u20131862), uno de los escritores pr\u00f3ximos al movimiento de la filosof\u00eda trascendentalista, es uno de los m\u00e1s conocidos. Su obra m\u00e1s representativa es Walden, aparecida en 1854, aunque redactada entre 1845 y 1847, cuando Thoreau decide instalarse en el aislamiento de una caba\u00f1a en el bosque, y vivir en \u00edntimo contacto con la naturaleza, en una vida de soledad y sobriedad. De esta experiencia, su filosof\u00eda trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armon\u00eda de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por Jonh Zerzan. Para George Woodcock, esta actitud puede estar tambi\u00e9n motivada por una cierta idea de resistencia al progreso y de rechazo al materialismo creciente que caracteriza la sociedad norteamericana de mediados de siglo XIX.\"[http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf \"Voluntary non-submission.

The second type is the amoral self-serving rationality of [[Egoist anarchism|egoism]] as most associated with [[Max Stirner]]. The third type is \"found in [[Herbert Spencer]]'s early predictions, and in that of some of his disciples such as [[Wordsworth Donisthorpe]], foreseeing the redundancy of the state in the source of social evolution\". The fourth type retains a moderated form of egoism and accounts for social cooperation through the advocacy of market relationships.<ref name=\"Freeden, Michael pp. 313\u2013314\"/> Individualist anarchism of different kinds have a few things in common.

First amongst these is the abstraction \"Man\", into which all unique individuals are submerged and lost. As he put it, \"liberalism is a religion because it separates my essence from me and sets it above me, because it exalts 'Man' to the same extent as any other religion does to God ... it sets me beneath Man.\" Indeed, he \"who is infatuated with Man leaves persons out of account so far as that infatuation extends, and floats in an ideal, sacred interest. Man, you see, is not a person, but an ideal, a spook.\" [p. 176 and p. 79] Among the many \"spooks\" Stirner attacks are such notable aspects of capitalist life as private property, the division of labour, the state, religion, and (at times) society itself.

To better understand the nature of these associations, which will replace the state, Stirner lists the relationships between friends, lovers, and children at play as examples.

Such associations are based on mutuality and a free and spontaneous co-operation between equals. As Stirner puts it, \"intercourse is mutuality, it is the action, the commercium, of individuals.\" [p.&nbsp;218] Its aim is \"pleasure\" and \"self-enjoyment.\" Thus Stirner sought a broad egoism, one which appreciated others and their uniqueness, and so criticised the narrow egoism of people who forgot the wealth others are:\n:\"But that would be a man who does not know and cannot appreciate any of the delights emanating from an interest taken in others, from the consideration shown to others.

Thus while people have the right to private property, they should give it away as enlightened [[altruists]]. This was to be based on [[utilitarian]] principles and he said: \"Every man has a right to that, the exclusive possession of which being awarded to him, a greater sum of benefit or pleasure will result than could have arisen from its being otherwise appropriated\".<ref name=pj/> However, benevolence was not to be enforced, being a matter of free individual \"private judgement\".

Greene]] introduced Proudhon's works to the United States. Greene adapted Proudhon's mutualism to American conditions and introduced it to [[Benjamin Tucker]].<ref>Tucker, Benjamin R., \"On Picket Duty\", ''Liberty (Not the Daughter but the Mother of Order)'' (1881\u20131908); 5 January 1889; 6, 10; APS Online p. 1</ref>\n\nProudhon opposed government privilege that protects capitalist, banking and land interests and the accumulation or acquisition of property (and any form of [[coercion]] that led to it) which he believed hampers competition and keeps wealth in the hands of the few. Proudhon favoured a right of individuals to retain the product of their labour as their own property, but believed that any property beyond that which an individual produced and could possess was illegitimate. Thus he saw private property as both essential to liberty and a road to tyranny, the former when it resulted from labour and was required for labour and the latter when it resulted in exploitation (profit, interest, rent and tax). He generally called the former \"possession\" and the latter \"property\". For large-scale industry, he supported workers associations to replace wage labour and opposed the ownership of land.\n\nProudhon maintained that those who labour should retain the entirety of what they produce and that [[monopoly|monopolies]] on credit and land are the forces that prohibit such. He advocated an economic system that included private property as possession and exchange market, but without profit, which he called [[mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]]. It is Proudhon's philosophy that was explicitly rejected by [[Joseph Dejacque]] in the inception of anarcho-communism, with the latter asserting directly to Proudhon in a letter that \"it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature\". An individualist rather than anarcho-communist,<ref name=\"Encyclopedia Americana\"/><ref name=\"Hamilton 1995 79\"/><ref name=\"Faguet 1970 147\"/> Proudhon said that \"communism ... is the very denial of society in its foundation\"<ref>Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph. ''The Philosophy of Misery: The Evolution of Capitalism''. BiblioBazaar, LLC (2006). {{ISBN|1-4264-0908-7}} p. 217</ref> and famously declared that \"[[property is theft]]!\" in reference to his rejection of ownership rights to land being granted to a person who is not using that land.\n\nAfter Dejacque and others split from Proudhon due to the latter's support of individual property and an exchange economy, the relationship between the individualists (who continued in relative alignment with the philosophy of Proudhon) and the anarcho-communists was characterised by various degrees of antagonism and harmony. For example, individualists like Tucker on the one hand translated and reprinted the works of [[collectivist anarchism|collectivists]] like [[Mikhail Bakunin]] while on the other hand rejected the economic aspects of collectivism and communism as incompatible with anarchist ideals.\n\n==== Mutualism ====\n{{socialism sidebar}}\n{{main|Mutualism (economic theory)}}\nMutualism is an [[anarchist school of thought]] which can be traced to the writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, who envisioned a society where each person might possess a [[means of production]], either individually or collectively, with trade representing equivalent amounts of labor in the [[free market]].<ref>[http://www.mutualist.org/ Mutualist.org Introduction]</ref> Integral to the scheme was the establishment of a mutual-credit bank which would lend to producers at a minimal interest rate only high enough to cover the costs of administration.<ref>Miller, David. 1987. \"Mutualism.\" The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Political Thought.

However, they argue for conditional titles to land, whose private ownership is legitimate only so long as it remains in use or occupation (which Proudhon called \"possession\").<ref>Swartz, Clarence Lee.

He further says: \"What I have in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am the proprietor of the thing\" and that \"I do not step shyly back from your property, but look upon it always as my property, in which I respect nothing.

Thoreau was an American author, poet, naturalist, tax resister, [[Development criticism|development critic]], surveyor, historian, philosopher and leading [[transcendentalist]]. He is best known for his book ''[[Walden]]'', a reflection upon [[simple living]] in natural surroundings; and his essay, ''[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]'', an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state. His thought is an early influence on [[green anarchism]], but with an emphasis on the individual experience of the natural world influencing later [[Anarcho-naturism|naturist]] currents,<ref name=\"thoreau\"/> [[simple living]] as a rejection of a [[Economic materialism|materialist]] lifestyle<ref name=thoreau/> and self-sufficiency were Thoreau's goals and the whole project was inspired by transcendentalist philosophy. Many have seen in Thoreau one of the precursors of ecologism and [[anarcho-primitivism]] represented today in [[John Zerzan]]. For [[George Woodcock]], this attitude can be also motivated by certain idea of resistance to progress and of rejection of the growing materialism which is the nature of American society in the mid 19th century.<ref name=\"naturismo\"/>\n\nThe essay [[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]] (''Resistance to Civil Government'') was first published in 1849. It argues that people should not permit governments to overrule or atrophy their consciences and that people have a duty to avoid allowing such [[acquiescence]] to enable the government to make them the agents of injustice. Thoreau was motivated in part by his disgust with slavery and the [[Mexican\u2013American War]].

This rejection galvanized the movement into fierce debates, with the natural rights proponents accusing the egoists of destroying libertarianism itself. So bitter was the conflict that a number of natural rights proponents withdrew from the pages of ''Liberty'' in protest even though they had hitherto been among its frequent contributors. Thereafter, ''Liberty'' championed egoism although its general content did not change significantly.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DdHseFmQiSUC Wendy Mcelroy. \"Benjamin Tucker, Individualism, & Liberty: Not the Daughter but the Mother of Order\"]</ref>\n\nSeveral periodicals were undoubtedly influenced by ''Liberty'''s presentation of egoism.
