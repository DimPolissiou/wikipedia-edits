The case was the first that clearly established that the judiciary can and must interpret what the Constitution permits and invalidate laws which are contrary to the Constitution.

The case was the first that clearly established that the judiciary can and must interpret what the Constitution permits and invalidate laws which are contrary to the Constitution. Thus, the Judiciary Act of 1789 was the first act of Congress to be partially invalidated by the Supreme Court.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/supremecourt/democracy/landmark_marbury.html Supreme Court History: The Court and Democracy, Marbury v.

In his work he called the quantity basic reproduction rate and denoted it by ''Z''<sub>0</sub>. Calling the quantity a \"rate\" can be misleading, insofar as it can be interpreted as number per unit of time. The expressions number or ratio are now preferred.\n\n== Definitions in specific cases ==\n=== Reproductive number as it relates to contact rate and infectious period ===\n[[File:R Naught Ebola and Flu Diagram.svg|thumb|''R''<sub>0</sub> is the average number of people infected from one other person, for example, Ebola has an ''R''<sub>0</sub> of two, so on average, a person who has Ebola will pass it on to two other people.]]\n\nSuppose that infectious individuals make an average of <math>\\beta</math> infection-producing contacts per unit time, with a mean infectious period of <math>\\tau</math>. Then the basic reproduction number is:\n\n:<math> R_0 = \\beta\\,\\tau</math>\n\nThis simple formula suggests different ways of reducing ''R''<sub>0</sub> and ultimately infection propagation. It is possible to decrease the number of infection-producing contacts per unit time <math>\\beta</math> by reducing the number of contacts per unit time (for example staying at home if the infection requires contact with others to propagate) or the proportion of contacts that produces infection (for example wearing some sort of protective equipment). It is also possible to decrease the infectious period <math>\\tau</math> by finding and then isolating, treating or eliminating (as is often the case with animals) infectious individuals as soon as possible.\n\n=== With varying latent periods ===\nIn cases of diseases with varying latent periods, the basic reproduction number can be calculated as the sum of the reproduction number for each transition time into the disease. An example of this is tuberculosis. Blower and coauthors calculated from a simple model of TB the following reproduction number:<ref>{{cite journal |last=Blower |first=S. M. |last2=Mclean |first2=A.

The definition must account for the fact that a typical infected individual may not be an average individual. As an extreme example, consider a population in which a small portion of the individuals mix fully with one another while the remaining individuals are all isolated. A disease may be able to spread in the fully mixed portion even though a randomly selected individual would lead to fewer than one secondary case. This is because the typical infected individual is in the fully mixed portion and thus is able to successfully cause infections. In general, if the individuals who become infected early in an epidemic may be more (or less) likely to transmit than a randomly chosen individual late in the epidemic, then our computation of ''R''<sub>0</sub> must account for this tendency. An appropriate definition for ''R''<sub>0</sub> in this case is \"the expected number of secondary cases produced by a typical infected individual early in an epidemic\".<ref name=\"Diekmann\">{{cite journal|author=O Diekmann|author2=J.A.P.

In his work he called the quantity basic reproduction rate and denoted it by ''Z''<sub>0</sub>. Calling the quantity a \"rate\" can be misleading, insofar as it can be interpreted as number per unit of time. The expressions number or ratio are now preferred.\n\n== Definitions in specific cases ==\n=== Reproductive number as it relates to contact rate and infectious period ===\n[[File:R Naught Ebola and Flu Diagram.svg|thumb|''R''<sub>0</sub> is the average number of people infected from one other person, for example, Ebola has an ''R''<sub>0</sub> of two, so on average, a person who has Ebola will pass it on to two other people.]]\n\nSuppose that infectious individuals make an average of <math>\\beta</math> infection-producing contacts per unit time, with a mean infectious period of <math>\\tau</math>. Then the basic reproduction number is:\n\n:<math> R_0 = \\beta\\,\\tau</math>\n\nThis simple formula suggests different ways of reducing ''R''<sub>0</sub> and ultimately infection propagation. It is possible to decrease the number of infection-producing contacts per unit time <math>\\beta</math> by reducing the number of contacts per unit time (for example staying at home if the infection requires contact with others to propagate) or the proportion of contacts that produces infection (for example wearing some sort of protective equipment). It is also possible to decrease the infectious period <math>\\tau</math> by finding and then isolating, treating or eliminating (as is often the case with animals) infectious individuals as soon as possible.\n\n=== With varying latent periods ===\nIn cases of diseases with varying latent periods, the basic reproduction number can be calculated as the sum of the reproduction number for each transition time into the disease. An example of this is tuberculosis. Blower and coauthors calculated from a simple model of TB the following reproduction number:<ref>{{cite journal |last=Blower |first=S. M. |last2=Mclean |first2=A.

The definition must account for the fact that a typical infected individual may not be an average individual. As an extreme example, consider a population in which a small portion of the individuals mix fully with one another while the remaining individuals are all isolated. A disease may be able to spread in the fully mixed portion even though a randomly selected individual would lead to fewer than one secondary case. This is because the typical infected individual is in the fully mixed portion and thus is able to successfully cause infections. In general, if the individuals who become infected early in an epidemic may be more (or less) likely to transmit than a randomly chosen individual late in the epidemic, then our computation of ''R''<sub>0</sub> must account for this tendency. An appropriate definition for ''R''<sub>0</sub> in this case is \"the expected number of secondary cases produced by a typical infected individual early in an epidemic\".<ref name=\"Diekmann\">{{cite journal|author=O Diekmann|author2=J.A.P.

In the early stages of an epidemic, growth is exponential, with a logarithmic growth rate{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n:<math>K = \\frac{d\\ln(N)}{dt}.</math>\n\nFor exponential growth, <math>N</math> can be interpreted as the cumulative number of diagnoses (including individuals who have recovered) or the present number of diagnosed patients; the logarithmic growth rate is the same for either definition. In order to estimate <math>R_0</math>, assumptions are necessary about the time delay between infection and diagnosis and the time between infection and starting to be infectious.\n\n=== Latent infectious period, isolation after diagnosis ===\nIn this model, an individual infection has the following stages:\n\n# Exposed: an individual is infected, but has no symptoms and does not yet infect others. The duration of the exposed state is <math>\\tau_E</math>.\n# Latent infectious: an individual is infected, has no symptoms, but does infect others. The duration of the latent infectious state is <math>\\tau_I</math>.

The mosque has played a significant role in the urban character of the town from the 17th to 20th centuries. Its construction was followed by the appearance of the [[craft]]smanship around it, which increased the importance of the town. The mosque holds historical value and is viewed of as a [[sacred]] monument.

halfway between the cities of [[Pe\u0107]] and [[Prizren]]. It is approximately {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} inland from the [[Adriatic Sea]]. \nThe city is situated some 208 kilometres north-east of [[Tirana]], 145 kilometres north-west of [[Skopje]], 80 kilometres west of the capital [[Pristina]], 435 kilometres south of [[Belgrade]] and 263 kilometres east of [[Podgorica]].\n\nThe city of Gjakova has been populated since the prehistoric era. During the [[Ottoman Kosovo|Ottoman period]], Gjakova served as a trading center on the route between [[Shkod\u00ebr]] and [[Istanbul]]. It was also one of the most developed trade centers at that time in the [[Balkans]].\n\n== Name ==\nThe Albanian name for the town is ''Gjakova'', while the Serbian name is ''\u0110akovica'' with the common ''-ica'' [[diminutive]] placename [[suffix]]. There are several theories on the origin of the village name, such as from the personal name ''[[Jakov]]''; the Serbian word ''[[wikt:\u0111ak|\u0111ak]]'' (pupil); or from the Albanian word for \"blood\" (''[[wikt:gjak|gjak]]'').<ref name=\"\u0427\u0443\u043f\u0438\u045b1898\">{{cite book|author=\u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430

Around the cornerstone of the town, the [[Old Bazaar, Gjakova|Old Bazaar]] \u2013 the center of trade and craftsmanship \u2013 was created. By 1900, the bazaar housed around 1000 enterprises.

It suffered damage during the [[Kosovo War]] but has since been renovated. The [[Hadum Mosque]], built in the 16th century, lies by the bazaar, and includes a highly decorated graveyard, where the town notables were buried. Within the mosque complex were the ''[[Turkish bath|hamam]]'' which was destroyed in 2008,{{why|date=July 2014}} the \"Old library\" from 1671, damaged in the [[Kosovo War]],  and also a ''meytepi'' from 1777. The Bazaar is linked to the city centre, just five minutes away via the Islam-Beg Bridge. The bazaar covers an area of about  {{convert|35000|m2|abbr=on}} and the length of its main road is 1&nbsp;km, with about 500 shops situated along it. It is, however, still home to an active mosque, several [[t\u00fcrbe]]s, and a clocktower.<ref>Broshura p\u00ebr promovimin e Gjakov\u00ebs,CBDC</ref>\n[[File:14 Kisha Sh\u00ebn Palit & Pjetrit 02.jpg|230px|thumb|View of the Saint Paul and Saint Peter Church]]\nThe '''[[Hadum Mosque]]''', located in the Old Bazaar, built in 1594 by Ottoman architect [[Mimar Sinan]] and financed by Hadum Aga. The mosque has played a significant role in the urban character of the town from the 17th to 20th centuries. Its construction was followed by the appearance of the [[craft]]smanship around it, which increased the importance of the town. The mosque holds historical value and is viewed of as a [[sacred]] monument. The great Tekke (\"Teqja e Madhe\"), built by the end of 16th century by Shejh Suleyman Axhiza Baba, a sufi mystic from Shkodra. It belongs to the [[Sufi order|Saadi order of sufism]]. The complex includes ''turbe'' (small [[mausoleums]]), ''samahanes'' (ritual prayer-halls), houses and fountains. It is characterized with detailed sacral architecture, with wood-carved elements.\n[[File:19 Gjakov\u00eb Muzeu Etnografik - Etnographic Museum.JPG|230px|thumb|left|The Ethnographic Museum of Gjakova was built in 1830. It has been under legal protection since 1955.]]\nGjakova is also characterized with two main Catholic Churches, which are part of the cultural heritage. The '''Saint Paul and Saint Peter Church''' (Albanian: Kisha e Sh\u00ebn Palit dhe Sh\u00ebn Pjetrit) is one of the tallest monuments in Gjakova, which can be seen from different points of the town. The arrival of the Albanian Catholics form [[Malesia]] resulted in rejuvenation of Saint Peter's Church in Gjakova in 1703, while in 1851 Gjakova's parish is rejuvenated. In 1999, after the [[Kosovo War|War]] it was totally destroyed. In the same site the new cathedral has been built.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|url=http://gjakovaportal.com/en/Culture/ArtMID/542/ArticleID/1289735|title=Churches|website=Gjakovaportal.com|accessdate=2017-08-28}}</ref>\n\nThe '''Saint Ndou Church''', was once called also the church of Padre Mila, who had built it in 1882, but it was later destroyed. In 1931, Padre Lorenc Mazrreku built in the same place the church that exists today, which was renovated few times, adding to it the guestrooms, offices and restrooms, but complying with the original architectural concept.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe '''Clock Tower''', built just after the Hadum Mosque at a place known as ''Field of the Clock'', characterizes the rapid economic development of Gjakova at that time. It was destroyed during the [[Balkan Wars]], while the belfry was removed and transported to Montenegro. With sides 4.10m long and a height of about 30 meters, a new clock tower was built later near the foundations of the previous one. Constructed mainly of stone with the wooden observation area and the roof covered in lead, the clock tower is unique of its kind.\n\n=== Events and festivals ===\n{{main|Events and festivals in Gjakova}}\nEvents and festivals in Gjakova are not as much in numbers, as they are highly valued. The historic city of Gjakova, Kosovo, especially the Old Town, is the hub of many outdoor and indoor festivals, cultural events and street parades. Many of them are seasonal and take place only one time, while others are organised annually for many years by various festival societies. All of them draw interest from the locals and visitors alike. Some of the events are organised by the city, some by private companies as well.\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n{{wide image|Gjakova n\u00eb Dimer.jpg|1200px|Panoramic view of Gjakova in winter.}}\n\n== Sport ==\nApart from being a culture and educative center of the [[Kosovo]], Gjakova is also known as a sport center. The best example of this is the fact of having 38 clubs, which compete in all leagues over Kosovo.\nGjakova's most successful team is [[KF V\u00ebllaznimi]] which has won 9 titles of [[Football Superleague of Kosovo|Kosovar Superliga]] and 4 Kosovo Cups.\n\"Shani Nushi\" is the city's sports hall, which has a capacity of 3500 seats, while the [[Gjakova City Stadium]] has a capacity of 6000 seats.\n\n==International relations==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Kosovo}}\n\nGjakova is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:\n{|class=\"wikitable\" \n|- valign=\"center\" \n|- align=\"center\"\n|\n*{{flagicon|ALB}} [[Shkod\u00ebr]] ([[Albania]])\n||\n*{{flagicon|US}} [[Jamestown, New York]] ([[United States]])\n||\n*{{flagicon|FRA}} [[Lod\u00e8ve]] ([[France]]) <ref>{{cite web |url=http://kk.rks-gov.net/gjakove/News/Binjakezohen-Gjakova-dhe-Lodeve-e-Frances.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102083657/http://kk.rks-gov.net/gjakove/News/Binjakezohen-Gjakova-dhe-Lodeve-e-Frances.aspx |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n||\n*{{flagicon|US}} [[Fort Dodge, Iowa]] ([[United States]])\n|}\n\n== Notable people==\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n*[[Amir Abrashi]], Albanian footballer\n*[[Fehmi Agani]], Albanian sociologist, academic and politician\n*[[Mahmut Bakalli]], Kosovo Albanian communist\n*[[Lorik Cana]], Albanian footballer and captain on National football team of Albania\n*[[Besim Dina]], Albanian television host\n*[[Masar Caka]], Albanian painter\n*[[Gent Cakaj]], Albanian minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs \n*[[Bardhyl \u00c7aushi]], Kosovo Albanian dean of law of the University of Pristina\n*[[Bajram Curri]], Albanian, founding member of the Committee for the National Defence of Kosovo\n*[[Bo\u017eidar Deli\u0107]] (born 1956), retired Yugoslav general and Serbian politician\n*[[Teki Dervishi]], Albanian playwright\n*[[Rauf Dhomi]], Albanian composer\n*[[Mladen Dodi\u0107]], Serbian football coach\n*[[Abdullah Pash\u00eb Dreni]], Albanian pasha \n*[[Emin Duraku]], Albanian, partisan\n*[[Bekim Fehmiu]], Yugoslav-Albanian actor, the first Eastern European to star in Hollywood during the Cold War\n*[[G\u00ebzim Lala]], Kosovar Albanian football player who played for FK Galenika Zemun.\n*[[Ardian Gashi]], Albanian-Norwegian footballer\n*[[Riza bej Gjakova]], Albanian nationalist and guerrilla fighter\n*[[Eros Grezda]], Albanian footballer \n*[[Besnik Hasi]], Albanian footballer and coach\n*[[Fadil Hoxha]], Albanian, first Prime Minister of AP Kosovo\n*[[Atifete Jahjaga]], Albanian, former President of Kosovo\n*[[Benet Kaci]], Albanian media personality\n*[[Valonis Kadrijaj]], Albanian-German footballer\n*[[Gjon Nikolle Kazazi]] was an Albanian Catholic bishop of Skopje, known for discovering Meshari of Gjon Buzuku.\n*[[Ardian Kozniku]], former Albanian-Croatian footballer\n*[[Ahmet Koronica]], Albanian nationalist\n*[[Flaka Krelani]], Albanian singer\n*[[Naim Kryeziu]], Albanian footballer, part of AS Roma's first Serie A win\n*[[Burim Kukeli]], Albanian footballer\n*[[Festina Mejzini]], Albanian singer\n*[[Mimoza Kusari Lila]], Kosovo Albanian politician\n*[[Din Mehmeti]], Albanian poet\n*[[Avni Mula]], Albanian musician\n*[[Blerim Mula]], Albanian footballer and manager\n*[[Muslim Mulliqi]], Albanian impressionist and expressionist painter \n*[[Fadil Nimani]], KLA fighter\n*[[Dimitar Obshti]], Bulgarian revolutionary\n*[[Fanol Perdedaj]], Albanian-German footballer\n*[[Ali Podrimja]], Albanian poet \n*[[Mirlinda Kusari Purrini]], Kosovo Albanian economist\n*[[Aleksandar Tijani\u0107]], Serbian journalist and former RTS director\n*[[Esat Valla]], Albanian painter\n*[[Miodrag Vlahovi\u0107 (foreign minister)|Miodrag Vlahovi\u0107]], Montenegrin former foreign minister\n*[[Liza Vorfi]], Albanian actress\n*[[Vladimir Durkovi\u0107]], Serbian football player and Olympic champion\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Notes==\n{{notes\n| notes =\n{{efn|name = status|{{Kosovo-note}}}}\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|\u0110akovica}}\n*{{wikivoyage-inline|Gjakova}}\n*{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Jakova|short=x}}\n\n{{Kosovo municipalities}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2011}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dakovica}}\n[[Category:Municipalities of Kosovo]]\n[[Category:Cities in Kosovo]]\n[[Category:Gjakova| ]]\n", "name_user": "94.189.236.23", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gjakova"}

The oldest of five children growing up in Greek culture, Zenos admired, respected, and was drawn to Greek sculpture. Greek art influenced his aesthetic vision; additional inspiration came from sculptors [[Michelangelo]], [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]], [[Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux|Carpeaux]] and [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]]. The poetry of [[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]], [[Robert Frost|Frost]], [[Theodore Roethke|Roethke]] and [[Robert Graves|Graves]], is important to Zenos, as is philosophy.\n\n\nBorn in 1951 in [[San Francisco]], Frudakis was raised in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], and [[Gary, Indiana]], where he worked in the steel mills. He began drawing at a very young age, and in 1972 came to Philadelphia to study at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]]. He studied sculpture with two [[Prix de Rome]] winners: his elder brother, sculptor Evangelos Frudakis, and painter James Hanes. At the [[University of Pennsylvania]], he earned bachelor's and master's degrees in Fine Art.<ref>Sarah Blackman, \"Sculpting a Life\" (feature article on Frudakis), ''The Pennsylvania Gazette'', Class of '82, November/December 2002, p. 3.</ref>\n\n\n==International Sculptures==\n* ''[[Reaching (sculpture)|Reaching]]''.

The oldest of five children growing up in Greek culture, Zenos admired, respected, and was drawn to Greek sculpture. Greek art influenced his aesthetic vision; additional inspiration came from sculptors [[Michelangelo]], [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]], [[Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux|Carpeaux]] and [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]]. The poetry of [[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]], [[Robert Frost|Frost]], [[Theodore Roethke|Roethke]] and [[Robert Graves|Graves]], is important to Zenos, as is philosophy.\n\n\nBorn in 1951 in [[San Francisco]], Frudakis was raised in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], and [[Gary, Indiana]], where he worked in the steel mills. He began drawing at a very young age, and in 1972 came to Philadelphia to study at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]]. He studied sculpture with two [[Prix de Rome]] winners: his elder brother, sculptor Evangelos Frudakis, and painter James Hanes. At the [[University of Pennsylvania]], he earned bachelor's and master's degrees in Fine Art.<ref>Sarah Blackman, \"Sculpting a Life\" (feature article on Frudakis), ''The Pennsylvania Gazette'', Class of '82, November/December 2002, p. 3.</ref>\n\n\n==International Sculptures==\n* ''[[Reaching (sculpture)|Reaching]]''.

Sponge cakes became the cake recognized today when bakers started using beaten eggs as a rising agent in the mid-18th century. The Victorian creation of [[baking powder]] by English food manufacturer [[Alfred Bird]] in 1843 allowed the addition of butter to the traditional sponge recipe, resulting in the creation of the [[#Victoria_sponge|Victoria Sponge]].\n\n==Background==\nThe earliest known recipe for sponge cake (or biscuit bread) from Gervase Markham's ''The English Huswife'' (1615) is prepared by mixing flour and sugar into eggs, then seasoning with [[anise]] and [[coriander]] seeds.<ref name=cake>{{cite book |last=Humble |first=Nicola |title=Cake: A Global History}}</ref> 19th century descriptions of [[avral]] vary from place to place but it sometimes described as \"sponge biscuits\" or a \"crisp sponge\" with a light dusting of sugar \".<ref name=oxford>''Oxford Companion of Sugar and Sweets''</ref> Traditional American sponge recipes diverged from earlier methods of preparation, adding ingredients like vinegar, baking powder, hot water or milk.<ref name=byrn /> \n\nSponge cake covered in boiled icing was very popular in [[American cuisine]] during the 1920s and 1930s. The delicate texture of sponge and angel food cakes, and the difficulty of their preparation, meant these cakes were more expensive than daily staple [[pies]].

In 1747 [[Hannah Glasse]] adds [[syllabub]] and currant jelly over the custard. Similar recipes are known for the same time with the sponge soaked in sherry, wine or fruit juice. [[Eliza Acton]]'s recipe for \"Duke's Custard\" was made from custard poured over brandied cherries rolled in sugar with sponge fingers (or macaroons) and pink whipped cream.

Therefore, the beating of egg whites in the mix to achieve the aeration is an essential characteristic of any Passover sponge recipe. Many families have at least one recipe they pass down through generations, and matzo meal-based cake mixes are available commercially. Several brands are easily found in kosher stores, especially before Passover. Typical flavorings include almonds, apples, dark chocolate, lemon, pecans, and poppy seeds. Apple or orange juice is the liquid ingredient. Milk is avoided, because it cannot be included in a dessert to be served after a meat based meal. The sponge, or a heavier variant in the form of an almond pudding, may be included as an element of the dessert in the Passover meal during the [[Seder]] service, when it is often combined in serving with a fruit [[compote]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Shalom Boston \u2013 Traditional Passover Seder Menu|url=http://www.shalomboston.com/Food/Menus/agentType/View/PropertyID/835.aspx |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Nathan |first=Joan |authorlink=Joan Nathan |date=1998 |title=Jewish Cooking in America |isbn=9780375402760}}</ref>\n\n===On Christmas===\nThe [[Yule log (cake)|Yule log]] is a [[Christmas dessert]] made from a sheet of sponge cake spread with filling and rolled up.

Sponge cakes became the cake recognized today when bakers started using beaten eggs as a rising agent in the mid-18th century. The Victorian creation of [[baking powder]] by English food manufacturer [[Alfred Bird]] in 1843 allowed the addition of butter to the traditional sponge recipe, resulting in the creation of the [[#Victoria_sponge|Victoria Sponge]].\n\n==Background==\nThe earliest known recipe for sponge cake (or biscuit bread) from Gervase Markham's ''The English Huswife'' (1615) is prepared by mixing flour and sugar into eggs, then seasoning with [[anise]] and [[coriander]] seeds.<ref name=cake>{{cite book |last=Humble |first=Nicola |title=Cake: A Global History}}</ref> 19th century descriptions of [[avral]] vary from place to place but it sometimes described as \"sponge biscuits\" or a \"crisp sponge\" with a light dusting of sugar \".<ref name=oxford>''Oxford Companion of Sugar and Sweets''</ref> Traditional American sponge recipes diverged from earlier methods of preparation, adding ingredients like vinegar, baking powder, hot water or milk.<ref name=byrn /> \n\nSponge cake covered in boiled icing was very popular in [[American cuisine]] during the 1920s and 1930s. The delicate texture of sponge and angel food cakes, and the difficulty of their preparation, meant these cakes were more expensive than daily staple [[pies]]. At the historic [[Frances Virginia Tea Room]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] sponge cake with lemon filling and boiled icing was served, while New York City's [[Crumperie]] served not only [[crumpets]] but toasted sponge cake as well.<ref>{{cite book|title=Tea at the Blue Lantern Inn: A Social History of the Tea Room Craze in America|publisher= St. Martin's Press|date= 2002|page= 44}}</ref><ref name=byrn />\n\nVariations on the theme of a cake lifted, partially or wholly, by trapped air in the batter exist in most places where European [[patisserie]] has spread, including the Anglo-Jewish \"plava\",<ref>{{cite book |author=Roden, Claudia |title=The Book of Jewish Food |location=New York |publisher=Alfred A.

In 1747 [[Hannah Glasse]] adds [[syllabub]] and currant jelly over the custard. Similar recipes are known for the same time with the sponge soaked in sherry, wine or fruit juice. [[Eliza Acton]]'s recipe for \"Duke's Custard\" was made from custard poured over brandied cherries rolled in sugar with sponge fingers (or macaroons) and pink whipped cream.

Therefore, the beating of egg whites in the mix to achieve the aeration is an essential characteristic of any Passover sponge recipe. Many families have at least one recipe they pass down through generations, and matzo meal-based cake mixes are available commercially. Several brands are easily found in kosher stores, especially before Passover. Typical flavorings include almonds, apples, dark chocolate, lemon, pecans, and poppy seeds. Apple or orange juice is the liquid ingredient. Milk is avoided, because it cannot be included in a dessert to be served after a meat based meal. The sponge, or a heavier variant in the form of an almond pudding, may be included as an element of the dessert in the Passover meal during the [[Seder]] service, when it is often combined in serving with a fruit [[compote]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Shalom Boston \u2013 Traditional Passover Seder Menu|url=http://www.shalomboston.com/Food/Menus/agentType/View/PropertyID/835.aspx |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Nathan |first=Joan |authorlink=Joan Nathan |date=1998 |title=Jewish Cooking in America |isbn=9780375402760}}</ref>\n\n===On Christmas===\nThe [[Yule log (cake)|Yule log]] is a [[Christmas dessert]] made from a sheet of sponge cake spread with filling and rolled up.

{"title_page": "Oval track racing", "text_new": "{{for|the variant of cycling|Track cycling}}\n{{short description|Form of auto racing where competitors duel on an oval shaped track}}\n\n'''Oval track racing''' is a form of closed-circuit [[motorsport|automobile racing]] that is contested on an oval-shaped track. An oval track differs from a [[Road racing|road course]] in that the layout resembles an [[oval]] with turns in only one direction, and the direction of traffic is almost universally counter-clockwise. Oval tracks are dedicated motorsport circuits, used predominantly in the United States. They often have [[banked turn]]s and some, despite the name, are not precisely oval, and the shape of the track can vary.\n[[Image:Martinsville Backstretch.JPG|right|thumb|350px|[[Martinsville Speedway]], a symmetrical oval, following a race.]]\n\nMajor forms of oval track racing include [[stock car racing]], [[open-wheel|open-wheel racing]], [[sprint car racing]], [[modified car racing]], [[midget car racing]] and [[Track racing|dirt track motorcycles]].\n\nOval track racing is the predominant form of auto racing in the United States. According to the 2013 National Speedway Directory, the total number of oval tracks, drag strips and road courses in the United States is 1,262, with 901 of those being oval tracks and 683 of those being dirt tracks. Among the most famous oval tracks in North America are the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]], [[Daytona International Speedway]] and [[Talladega Superspeedway]].\n\nNotable ovals in other countries include [[Aut\u00f3dromo Ciudad de Rafaela|Rafaela]] in Argentina, [[Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez|Mexico City]] in Mexico, [[Twin Ring Motegi|Motegi]] in Japan, [[EuroSpeedway Lausitz|Lausitzring]] in Germany, the [[Calder Park Thunderdome]] in Australia, [[Brooklands]] and [[Rockingham Motor Speedway|Rockingham]] in the United Kingdom, [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]] in Italy, and [[Autodrome de Linas-Montlh\u00e9ry|Montlh\u00e9ry]] in France.\n\n== Oval racing ==\n\n===Pack racing===\n[[File:Three-wide multiple row back.JPG|thumb|right|350px|Pack racing at [[Daytona International Speedway]].]]\nPack racing is a phenomenon found on fast, high-banked superspeedways. It occurs when the vehicles racing are cornering at their limit of [[aerodynamic drag]], but within their limit of [[Traction (engineering)|traction]]. This allows drivers to race around the track constantly at [[wide open throttle]]. Since the vehicles are within their limit of traction, [[Drafting (racing)|drafting]] through corners will not hinder a vehicle's performance. As cars running together are faster than cars running individually, all cars in the field will draft each other simultaneously in one large pack. In [[stock car racing]] this is often referred to as \"[[restrictor plate racing]]\" because [[NASCAR]] mandates that each car on its two longest high-banked ovals, [[Talladega Superspeedway|Talladega]] and [[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]], use an [[air restrictor]] to reduce [[horsepower]].\n\nThe results of pack racing may vary. As drivers are forced to race in a confined space, [[overtaking]] is very common as vehicles may travel two and three abreast. This forces drivers to use strong mental discipline in negotiating traffic. There are drawbacks, however. Should an accident occur at the front of the pack, the results could block the track in a short amount of time. This leaves drivers at the back of the pack with little time to react and little room to maneuver. The results are often catastrophic as numerous cars may be destroyed in a single accident. This type of accident is often called \"[[The Big One (NASCAR)|The Big One]]\".<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/motorsports/nascar_plus/news/2001/04/20/strategy_fish/ CNNSI]\"Hangin' Back\" retrieved November 17, 2007</ref>\n\n===Comparison with road racing===\nOval track racing requires different tactics than road racing. While the driver doesn't have to shift gears nearly as frequently, brake as heavily or as often, or deal with turns of various radii in both directions as in road racing, drivers are still challenged by negotiating the track. Where there is generally one preferred line around a road course, there are many different lines which can work on an oval track. The preferred line depends on many factors including track conditions, car set-up, and traffic. The oval track driver must choose which line to use each time he approaches a corner. On a short track in a 25 lap feature race, a driver might not run any two laps with the same line. Both types of racing place physical demands on the driver. A driver in an [[IndyCar Series|IndyCar]] race at [[Richmond International Raceway]] may be subject to as many lateral [[g-force]]s (albeit in only one direction) as a [[Formula One]] driver at [[Istanbul Park]].\n\nWeather also plays a different role in each discipline. Road racing offers a variety of fast and slow corners that allow the use of [[rain tire]]s. Paved oval tracks generally don't run with a wet track surface. Dirt ovals will sometimes support a light rain. Some tracks (e.g., Evergreen Speedway in Monroe, WA) have \"rain or shine\" rules requiring races to be run in rain.\n\nSafety has also been a point of difference between the two. While a road course usually has abundant [[run-off area]]s, gravel traps, and tire barriers, oval tracks usually have a concrete retaining wall separating the track from the fans. Innovations have been made to change this, however. The [[SAFER barrier]] was created to provide a less dangerous alternative to a traditional concrete wall. The barrier can be retrofitted onto an existing wall or may take the place of a concrete wall completely.\n\n==Track classification (size)==\n[[Image:West row stadium.jpg|thumb|right|275px|A dirt oval track]]\nOval tracks are classified based upon their size, surface, banking, and shape.  Their size can range from only a few hundred feet to over two and a half miles.  Track surfaces can be [[Dirt track racing|dirt]], concrete, asphalt, or a combination of concrete and asphalt. Some ovals in the early twentieth century had [[board track racing|wood]] surfaces.\n\nThe definitions used to differentiate track sizes have changed over the years. While some tracks use terms such as \"speedway\" or \"superspeedway\" in their name, they may not meet the specific definitions used in this article.\n\n==={{Visible anchor|Short track}}===\n[[File:Bristol Motor Speedway in Bristol.jpg|thumb|[[Bristol Motor Speedway]], a short oval]]\nA short track is an oval track less than one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) long, with the majority being 0.5 miles (0.8&nbsp;km) or shorter. Drivers seeking careers in oval track racing generally serve their apprenticeship on short tracks before moving up to series which compete on larger tracks. Due to their short length and fast action, these tracks are often nicknamed \"[[bullring]]s\". Professional-level NASCAR races on short tracks usually use a 500-lap or 400-lap distance. Short tracks in many cases have lights installed and routinely host night races. The short ovals still form the backbone of NASCAR in the feeder series. Three race tracks of this type are also represented in the Cup: Bristol, Martinsville and Richmond. At the request of some fans on social media, there are plans to hold more races on this oval type in the future. Tracks with potential for future cup races are the Iowa Speedway built in 2006, the Nashville Fairgrounds Speedway used until 1984 in the Cup, and the Memphis Motorsports Park, which had races of the Busch Series back then until the 2000s.\n\n==={{Visible anchor|Mile oval}}===\nSynonymous with the name, a 1-mile (1.61&nbsp;km) oval is a popular and common length for oval track racing. The exact measurements, however, can vary by as much as a tenth of a mile and still fall into this category. Most mile ovals are relatively flat-banked, with [[Dover International Speedway|Dover]] being a notable exception. In NASCAR, the 1-mile oval tracks are among the intermediate tracks. IndyCar rated this tracks as short ovals, since they usually do not run on ovals shorter than 3/4 of a mile. The one-mile ovals have lost a great deal of their former importance for oval racing. Most of the racetracks abandoned by NASCAR or IndyCar in the 2000s were of this type. These include the Chicago Motor Speedway and the Walt Disney World Speedway, which were build during the 1990th construction boom but only used for 4 years. The historic Nazareth Speedway, which was paved in 1986, was completely abandoned after the 2004 season. Physically, the Milwaukee Mile, the oldest oval race track in the world, as well as the Rockingham Speedway and the Pikes Peak Raceway still exist. However, these racetracks have not been used by nationally important motorsports events for years. There are only three one milers left in the NASCAR racing calendar: Phoenix, Loudon and Dover. IndyCar has not been driving an oval of this length since 2018.\n\n==={{Visible anchor|Intermediate}}===\n[[File:Nascarvegas03.jpg|thumb|[[Las Vegas Motor Speedway]]]]\nAlso referred to with the general term of \"speedway\", these courses are 1 to 2 miles (1.6 to 3.2&nbsp;km) in length, but the term is particularly reserved for 1.5-mile (2.4&nbsp;km) tracks. At the beginning of the history of NASCAR and IndyCar, this oval size was not very common. Until 1990 there were only five examples: Two of these, the Marchbanks Speedway (1.4 miles) and the Trenton Speedway (1.5 miles), were demolished in the 1970s and 1980s. Only three of them, Charlotte Motor Speedway, Atlanta Motor Speedway and Darlington Raceway have survived to this day. All other ovals of this type were built after 1994. During the race track construction boom of the late 1990s, these tracks began to be labeled with the rather derogatory term \"cookie cutter\" tracks, as their differences were perceived to be minimal. \nIn 1992, [[Charlotte Motor Speedway|Charlotte]] became the first intermediate track to install lights and allow for night racing. It is now commonplace for these types of tracks to host night races. Intermediate tracks usually have moderate to steep banking. Almost all modern race tracks that are still used in NASCAR and IndyCar today are of this type. Since their size allows them to compromise high speeds with sightlines, especially tri- and quad-ovals of 1.5 mile length have become commonplace in major racing series that use oval tracks.\n\n==={{Visible anchor|Superspeedway}}===\nA superspeedway is at least 2.0 miles (3.2&nbsp;km) in length.  There are seven superspeedways in the United States, the most famous being [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] and [[Daytona International Speedway]], both {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} long.  These tracks were built in 1909 and 1959 respectively.  Indianapolis Motor Speedway was built as a facility for the automotive industry to conduct research and development.<ref>[http://www2.indystar.com/library/factfiles/sports/autoracing/indy500.html Indystar.com]\"History of the Indianapolis 500\" Retrieved November 19, 2007</ref>  Daytona International Speedway was built as a replacement for the [[Daytona Beach Road Course]], which combined the town's main street and its famous beach. Daytona hosts the [[Daytona 500]], NASCAR's most prestigious race, while the Indianapolis Motor Speedway is home to the [[Indianapolis 500]] and the [[Brickyard 400]].\n[[Image:Ims aerial.jpg|thumb|right|320px|[[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]]]]\n\nThe longest superspeedway is the [[Talladega Superspeedway]] in [[Talladega, Alabama]].  Built in 1969, it is {{convert|2.66|mi|km|2|abbr=off|sp=us}} long, and holds the current record for fastest speed in a stock car, lapping at an average of {{convert|216.309|mi/h|km/h|3|abbr=on}} and reaching {{convert|228|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} at the end of the backstretch.<ref>[http://www.nascar.com/2004/news/headlines/cup/06/10/rwallace_talladega/index.html NASCAR.com&nbsp;\u2013 Rusty Wallace hits {{convert|228|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} in Talladega trial&nbsp;\u2013 June 10, 2004<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Daytona and Talladega are the pinnacle of stock car superspeedway racing, where [[restrictor plate]]s are mandated by the sport's ruling body to reduce the high speeds accommodated by their steep banking since 1988.\n\nOther superspeedways used by NASCAR include the [[Michigan International Speedway]] (2.0 miles), [[Auto Club Speedway]] (known as California Speedway prior to February 2008) (2.0 miles), and [[Pocono Raceway]] (2.5 miles). Auto Club Speedway and Michigan are often considered intermediate tracks by NASCAR due to their similarities with 1.5-mile tracks, while Pocono and Indianapolis are sometimes classified separately, as they are the only long, flat tracks on the schedule.

Michigan Speeway was part of the series from 2002 to 2007, AutoClub Speedway from 2002 to 2005 and a second time from 2012 to 2015, Pocono was used by IndyCar between 2014 and 2019. In NASCAR they are still an essential part of the racing calendar.\n\nThe seventh superspeedway is [[Texas World Speedway]], which is the original \"sister track\" to Michigan. The two-mile oval, with its 22-degree banking, was the site of Mario Andretti's closed-course record of {{convert|214.158|mph|km/h|3|abbr=on}} which stood for 12 years. No major professional series have raced at TWS since the 1990s, however, the track's 1.8, 2.9 and 3.1-mile road courses are very popular with amateur racing clubs.\n\n== Track classification (shape) ==\nA typical oval track consists of two parallel straights, connected by two 180\u00b0 turns. Although most ovals generally have only two radii curves, they are usually advertised and labeled as four 90\u00b0 turns. While many oval tracks conform to the traditional symmetrical design, asymmetrical tracks are not uncommon.\n\n=== Classical geometric shapes ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"10%\" |Shape !! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"50%\" |Description !! width=40% colspan=\"4\"|Examples\n|-\n! Short Track !! Mile Oval !! Intermediate !! Superspeedway\n|-\n| Paper clip oval || One sub-classification of the traditional oval shape is the \"paper clip\" oval. The layout consists of two long straights, connected by two sharp, tight-radius turns, giving the track a shape resembling a [[paper clip]]. The courses are usually very challenging, and usually offer little banking, making the turns very slow and tight to maneuver. This is the classic layout of short tracks or mile ovals. Most short tracks are paper clips. But there exist some tracks about 1 mile length with this shape, too. || [[File:Martinsville_Speedway_track_map.png|left|thumb|100px|[[Martinsville Speedway]]]]|| [[File:Chicago Motor Speedway.svg|left|thumb|100px|[[Chicago Motor Speedway]]]]||[[File:Ovalo Miguel E.

Pursuant to its name, the track shape resembles a rectangle, with two long straights and two short straights, connected by four separate turns. The primary characteristic of a rounded-off rectangle that differentiates it from a traditional oval shape, is the presence of two \"short chutes\", one between turns one and two, and one between turns three and four. While most traditional ovals have two continuous 180\u00b0 radii (advertised as four 90\u00b0 turns), this shape actually has four distinct 90\u00b0 curves.  When it was first constructed, the Homestead-Miami Speedway was designed to this layout and touted as a \"mini-Indy.\" However, at only 1.5 miles (one mile shorter than Indy), the track proved to be uncompetitive, owing largely to the sharp corners, and was soon reconfigured as a traditional oval. Indianapolis remains as the only major track to this specification. Tracks of this shape have been avoided due to grandstand sight line issues, slow corners, and dangerous impact angles. However, numerous private manufacturers' test tracks use this type of layout. The only major short track with a rectangular layout has the shape of a rounded-off square with four nearly identical straights and turns. || [[File:FlemingtonSpeedwayMap.svg|left|thumb|100px|[[Flemington Speedway]], a square]] || - ||[[File:Homestead-Miami Speedway track map--Speedway.svg|left|thumb|120x120px|[[Homestead\u2013Miami Speedway|Homestead-Miami Speedway]]]]||[[File:Indianapolis Oval.svg|thumb|100px|left|[[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]]]]\n|-\n| Rounded-off trapezoid || A very rare layout is a trapezoid oval course. The difference to rounded-off rectangle is the shorter back straight and longer front straight. So, the Turns 1 and 4 are tighter than the Turns 2 and 3.  || - || - || [[File:Jacarepagu\u00e1-oval.svg|left|thumb|100px|[[Emerson Fittipaldi Speedway]]]] || -\n|-\n| Rounded-off triangle || The classic triangular layout is rare in oval courses, too. Technically, there are tri-ovals. In the strict sense, the modern oval tracks are called tri-oval, which rather are similar to a '''D'''. <small>See next section.</small> The Pocono Raceway is a triangular course with three distinct, widely varying turns. Due to its layout the \"Pocono Raceway\" is often described with the words: \"It is an oval course, which drives like a road course.\" The triangle is a popular oval shape outside the United States. There are some triangular oval tracks in Canada, Germany and Mexico. || [[File:Sanair_Super_Speedway_map.svg|left|thumb|100px|[[Sanair Super Speedway]], an equilateral triangle]] || - || [[File:Marchbanks_Speedway_(Hanford_Motor_Speedway)_map.svg|left|thumb|75px|[[Marchbanks Speedway]]]] || [[File:Pocono_Raceway.svg|left|thumb|100px|[[Pocono Raceway]]]]\n|-\n|}\n\nAdditional prominent examples:<gallery>\nFile:EvergreenSpeedway.svg|[[Evergreen Speedway]]\nFile:NashvilleSpeedwayMap.svg|[[Fairgrounds Speedway]]\nFile:IndianapolisRacewayParkMap.svg|[[Indianapolis Raceway Park|Indianapolis Raceway]]\nFile:MesaMarinSpeedwayMap.svg|[[Mesa Marin Raceway|Mesa Marin Speedway]]\nFile:USA International Speedway - Lakeland Fl.svg|[[USA International Speedway]]\nFile:ThompsonInternationalSpeedwayMap.svg|[[Thompson Speedway Motorsports Park|Thompson International Speedway]]\nFile:NorthWilkesboroSpeedwayMap.svg|[[North Wilkesboro Speedway]]\nFile:Milmilelayout.PNG|[[Milwaukee Mile]]\nFile:New Hampshire Motor Speedway.PNG|[[New Hampshire Motor Speedway]]\nFile:SalemSpeedwayMap.svg|[[Salem Speedway]]\nFile:Rockingham Motor Speedway.png|[[Rockingham Motor Speedway]]\nFile:EuroSpeedway Lausitz tri-oval diagram.svg|[[EuroSpeedway Lausitz]]\nFile:Tri\u00f3valo Bernardo Obreg\u00f3n.png|[[Tri\u00f3valo Bernardo Obreg\u00f3n]]\nFile:Atlanta International Speedway.svg|[[Atlanta Motor Speedway|Atlanta International Speedway]]\nFile:NorthWilkesboroSpeedwayMap.svg|[[:File:NorthWilkesboroSpeedwayMap.svg|North Wilkesboro Speedway]]\n</gallery>\n\n=== Tri-ovals ===\n{{main|Tri-oval}}\n\nThe tri-oval is the common shape of the ovals from the construction booms of the 1960s and 1990s. The use of the tri-oval shape for automobile racing was conceived by [[Bill France, Sr.]] during the planning for Daytona. The triangular layout allowed fans in the grandstands an angular perspective of the cars coming towards and moving away from their vantage point. Traditional ovals (such as [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway|Indianapolis]]) offered only limited linear views of the course, and required fans to look back and forth much like a tennis match. The tri-oval shape prevents fans from having to \"lean\" to see oncoming cars, and creates more forward sight lines. The modern tri-ovals were often called as ''cookie cutters'' because of their (nearly) identical shape and identical kind of races.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"10%\" |Shape !! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"50%\" |Description !! width=40% colspan=\"4\"|Examples\n|-\n! Short Track !! Mile Oval !! Intermediate !! Superspeedway\n|-\n| Tri-oval || A tri-oval resembles an isosceles triangle with rounded-off corners. The circuits typically have a straight backstretch, while the main straightaway where the pit area and most grandstands are located, has a \"tri-oval\" curve (sometimes characterized as a fifth curve) that makes the mainstretch skewed. Tri-ovals have become preferable to track builders as they offer superior sightlines. Generally on tri-ovals the start-finish line is located on the apex of the tri-oval curve. Two exceptions are Talladega and Walt Disney World Speedway, where the start-finish line are located on the straight between the curve and turn one.  || - || [[File:Walt_Disney_World_Speedway_diagram.svg|left|thumb|100px|[[Walt Disney World Speedway]]]] ||[[File:Las_Vegas_Motor_Speedway_diagram.svg|left|thumb|100px|The [[Las Vegas Motor Speedway]]]] || [[File:Daytona International Speedway.svg|left|thumb|100px|[[Daytona International Speedway]]]]<br />\n|-\n| Quad-oval || A tri-oval with a \"double dogleg\" is often called a \"quad-oval\". A quad-oval is very similar to a tri-oval in sightlines and layout. One specific feature is that the start-finish line segment actually falls on a straight section, rather than along a curve. The shape has become a signature for [[Speedway Motorsports]], which owns all major quad-ovals in the United States. The [[Calder Park Thunderdome]] in [[Melbourne]], Australia, is also an example of a quad-oval speedway, though since its opening in 1987 it has generally been referred to as a tri-oval. || [[File:Birmingham_Interational_Raceway.svg|left|thumb|50px|[[Birmingham International Raceway]]]] || - || [[File:Charlotte_Motor_Speedway_diagram.svg|left|thumb|100px|[[Charlotte Motor Speedway]]]] || -\n|-\n| D-shaped oval || A variation of tri-oval is the \"D-shaped oval\". Similar to a tri-oval, a D-shaped oval has a straight backstretch, but a long, sweeping frontstretch, giving the circuit a layout resembling the letter ''D''. The shape originated with a pair of sister tracks built in the 1960s: Michigan International Speedway and Texas World Speedway. Initially, this design has been used only for superspeedways. But there are now some short tracks with this shape, too. ||[[File:Richmond International Speedway.png|left|thumb|100px|[[Richmond Raceway|Richmond (International) Raceway]]]] || [[File:Rockingham Speedway.svg|left|thumb|100px|[[Rockingham Speedway]]]] || - || <br />[[File:Michigan International Speedway track map.png|left|thumb|100px|[[Michigan International Speedway]]]]\n|-\n|}\n\nAdditional prominent examples:<gallery>\nFile:Chicagoland Speedway diagram.svg|[[Chicagoland Speedway]]\nFile:Kansas Speedway diagram.svg|[[Kansas Speedway]]\nFile:Kentucky Speedway.svg|[[Kentucky Speedway]]\nFile:Nashville Superspeedway diagram.svg|[[Nashville Superspeedway]]\nFile:Phakisa Freeway - Speedway.svg|[[Phakisa Freeway]]\nFile:Atlanta Motor Speedway.svg|[[Atlanta Motor Speedway]]\nFile:TexasMotorSpeedway.svg|[[Texas Motor Speedway]]\nFile:Calder Park (Australia) track map--Thunderdome Speedway.svg|[[Calder Park Raceway|Calder Park Thunderdome Superspeedway]]\nFile:Ovalo de Chiapas.png|[[Aut\u00f3dromo Chiapas|Autodromo Chiapas]]\nFile:Ovalo Aguascalientes.png|[[Ovalo Aguascalientes M\u00e9xico|Ovalo Aguascalientes]]\nFile:Iowa Speedway track map.png|[[Iowa Speedway]]\nFile:Memphis International Raceway diagram.svg|[[Memphis International Raceway]]\nFile:MyrtleBeachSpeedwayMap.png|[[Myrtle Beach Speedway]]\nFile:Pikes Peak International Raceway.svg|[[Pikes Peak International Raceway]]\nFile:Auto Club Speedway (formerly California Speedway) - Speedway.svg|[[Auto Club Speedway]]\nFile:Texas World Speedway-Superspeedway.svg|[[Texas World Speedway]]\nFile:Talladega Superspeedway.svg|[[Talladega Superspeedway]]\n</gallery>\n\n=== Unique shapes ===\nThere are a lot of oval tracks, which neither have a classical geometric shape nor still represent a modern tri-oval in the strict sense. <!--The term \"Roval\" has been used to loosely describe an oval track with an asymmetrical, unusual, or [[rectangle|oblong]] shape, or atypical features {{cn|no google results|date=July 2016}}. The name is a [[portmanteau]] of \"road course\" and \"oval.\" --> While these courses still technically fall under the category of ovals, their unique shape, flat corners, hard braking zones, or increased difficulty, often produces driving characteristics similar to those of a road course.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! width=20%| Shape !! width=60%| Description !! width=20%|Examples\n|-\n| Egg-shape || There are some tracks, which were planned as a classic ovals, but had to be built for reasons of space in egg shape. An egg-shaped oval substantially corresponds to the classical form, however, the two straights are non-parallel arranged. A straight line is slightly longer than the other and the two curves have different radii. ||[[File:Darlington_raceway.svg|thumb|100px| [[Darlington Raceway]]|alt=|center]]\n|-\n| Dogleg || Some oval tracks have minor variations, such as kinks or doglegs. A \"dogleg\" is a defined as a soft curve down one of the straights, either inward or outward, which skews the oval into a non-symmetric or non-traditional shape. While the extra curve would seemingly give the oval five turns, the dogleg is normally omitted from identification, and the ovals are still labeled with four turns. ||[[File:Nazareth Speedway Trackmap.png|thumb|100px|[[Nazareth Speedway]]|alt=|center]]\n|-\n| Kidney-bean-shape || A Kidney-bean-shape had a unique right-hand dogleg.

The now defunct [[Ascot Speedway]] featured 1/2 mile and 1/4 mile dirt oval tracks, and [[Irwindale Speedway]] features 1/2 mile and 1/3 mile concentric paved oval tracks. Pocono Raceway once had a 3/4 mile oval which connected to the main stretch, and circled around the garage area.\n\nIn 1991, Charlotte Motor Speedway connected the quad oval start-finish straight to the pit lane with two 180 degree turns, resulting in a concentric 1/4-mile oval layout. The 1/4-mile layout became a popular venue for [[legends car racing]]. The name \"legends oval\" was derived from this use. They have also seen use with go-karts, short track stock cars, and other lower disciplines. This idea was adopted by numerous tracks including Texas Motor Speedway, Atlanta Motor Speedway, [[Kentucky Speedway]], [[Las Vegas Motor Speedway]], and [[Iowa Speedway]] which has a 1/8 mile version.\n\nPerhaps the most unusual concentric oval facility is Dover Speedway-[[Dover Downs]]. The one-mile oval track encompasses a 0.625-mile [[Horse racing|harness racing]] track inside.\n\n==Track classification (banking)==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F003014-0010, Berlin, Autorennen auf der Avus.jpg|thumb|right|300px|41\u00b0 banking of [[AVUS]], Germany]]\n[[File:Monza banking 2003.JPG|thumb|right|300px|38.69\u00b0 banking of [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]], Italy]]\nOval tracks usually have slope in both straight and in curves, but the slope on the straights is less, circuits without any slope are rare to find, low-slope are usually old or small tracks, high gradient are more common in new circuits.\n\nCircuits like [[Milwaukee Mile]] and [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] are approximately 9\u00b0 tilt in curves are considered low slope, superspeedways like [[Talladega Superspeedway|Talladega]] have up to 33\u00b0 of tilt in curves, [[Daytona International Raceway|Daytona]] has up to 32\u00b0, both are considered high inclination.

It\u2019s a ROVAL, and it\u2019s in Charlotte. |author= C Jackson Cowart |date= 23 May 2017 |publisher= Charlotte Observer }}</ref>) is an oval track racing facility that features a road course in the infield (or outfield), that is usually linked to the oval circuit. This type of course makes for a multi-purpose track, and allows the facility to be used for both oval and road racing. A typical combined road course consists of the oval portion of the track, using the same start/finish line, and same pit area, but a mid-course diversion to a winding road circuit in the infield (or outfield). At some point, the circuit leads back to the main oval, and completes the rest of the lap. On some of the faster ovals, a [[chicane]] is present on long back-straights, to keep speeds down, and create additional braking/passing zones. Some more complex facilities feature a stand-alone road course layout(s) in the infield not directly linked to the oval layout, or otherwise using only a short portion of the oval.\n\nCombined road courses combine the high speed characteristics of ovals with the technical precision of [[road racing|road courses]]. It allows road racing disciplines the unique experience of being held in the stadium style atmosphere of an oval superspeedway. Numerous combined road courses saw widespread use with sports cars in the 1970s and early 1980s. However, their use has since diminished considerably, since most layouts lacked the desirable topography and competitive challenges of natural road courses. In addition, most combined road course circuits offer poor sightlines for fans sitting in the grandstands. Oftentimes the challenging infield portion is obscured or not visible at all from the grandstands that line the circumference of the oval track, so many fans choose to view from the ground level inside the infield - leaving the grandstands mostly empty and unsightly.\n\nMany combined road course layouts have been abandoned, or are only used for testing and [[Sports Car Club of America|amateur race meets]]. Since 1962, the most famous race continuously held on a combined road course has been the [[24 Hours of Daytona]].\n\nIn 2018 [[NASCAR]] held the [[Bank of America Roval 400]] on a combined course at the [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]].\n\nIn some rare examples, the combined road course layout is run in the opposite direction as the oval circuit. For instance, at [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway|Indianapolis]] the oval is run counter-clockwise, but the combined road course used during the [[IndyCar Series]] [[Grand Prix of Indianapolis]] is run clockwise. However the  [[Indianapolis motorcycle Grand Prix|Moto GP]]  races were run counter-clockwise, with some reconfigured corners to fix corner apex problems. [[Michigan International Speedway|Michigan]] was also an example of a clockwise combined road course. Another example is the [[Adelaide International Raceway]] in [[Australia]] which combines a 2.41&nbsp;km (1.50&nbsp;mi) road course with an 0.805&nbsp;km (0.500&nbsp;mi) speedway bowl. The Bowl forms a permanent part of the road course and also runs clockwise. At many tracks, multiple configurations are available for the combined road course layout(s).\n\nAn example of an outfield combined road course can be seen at the [[Calder Park Raceway]] in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. The Calder Park complex has a 1.119&nbsp;mi (1.801&nbsp;km) high-banked oval speedway called the Thunderdome as well as a separate road course. The road course and the oval can be linked via two short roads that connect the front straight of the road course to the back straight of the oval. As they are separate tracks, this creates a unique situation where different races can actually be run on both the oval and the full road course at the same time. Also unique is that unlike most combined circuits which use the oval track's start/finish line and pits, in the case of Calder Park it is the road course start/finish line and pits that are used. Unfortunately this configuration was only used twice (both in 1987) and has not been used for major motor racing since hosting [[1987 Bob Jane T-Marts 500|Round 9]] of the [[1987 World Touring Car Championship season|1987 World Touring Car Championship]].\n{{-}}\n\n==Oval track construction booms==\nThere have been two distinct oval race track construction [[Economic boom|\"booms\"]] in the United States. The first took place in the 1960s, and the second took place in the mid-to-late 1990s. The majority of tracks from the 1960s boom and the 1990s boom have survived, but some tracks failed to achieve long term financial success. Incidentally, these two booms loosely coincided with the similar construction boom of the baseball/football [[Multi-purpose stadium|cookie-cutter stadiums]] of the 1960s and 1970s, and the subsequent sport-specific stadium construction boom that began in the 1990s.\n\n===Tracks built during the 1960s boom===\n*[[Daytona International Speedway]] (1959)\n*[[Charlotte Motor Speedway]] (1960)\n*[[Atlanta Motor Speedway]] (1960; substantially reconstructed in 1997)\n*[[Rockingham Speedway|North Carolina Motor Speedway]] (1965; demoted to primarily a test facility since 2005)\n*[[Dover International Speedway]] (1966)\n*[[Michigan International Speedway]] (1968)\n*[[Texas World Speedway]] (1969; primarily amateur racing and testing from 1981-2016; closed 2017)\n*[[Talladega Superspeedway]] (1969)\n*[[Ontario Motor Speedway]] (1970; demolished 1980)\n*[[Pocono Raceway]] (1971)\n\n===Tracks built during the 1990s boom===\n*[[Homestead-Miami Speedway]] (1995)\n*[[Las Vegas Motor Speedway]] (1996)\n*[[Texas Motor Speedway]] (1996)\n*[[Gateway Motorsports Park|Gateway International Raceway]] (1997)\n*[[Pikes Peak International Raceway]] (1997; hosting only non-major events since 2008)\n*[[Auto Club Speedway]] (1997)\n*[[Memphis Motorsports Park|Memphis International Raceway]] (1998)\n*[[Kentucky Speedway]] (2000)\n*[[Kansas Speedway]] (2001)\n*[[Chicagoland Speedway]] (2001)\n\n===Track built during the 1990s that have been closed or demolished===\n*[[Walt Disney World Speedway]] (1996; demolished 2015\u20132016)\n*[[Chicago Motor Speedway]] (1999; demolished in 2009)\n*[[Nashville Superspeedway]] (2001; closed 2011)\n\n==See also==\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n*[[Board track racing]]\n*[[Dirt track racing]]\n*[[Dragstrip]]\n*[[Road racing]]\n*[[Track racing]]\n{{Col-break}}\n*[[List of auto racing tracks in Canada#Paved ovals|List of paved ovals in Canada]]\n*[[List of auto racing tracks in Mexico#Ovals|List of paved ovals in Mexico]]\n*[[List of auto racing tracks in the United States#Paved ovals|List of paved ovals in US]]\n*[http://f1stockcars.com/ UK Formula 1 Stockcars]\n{{Col-break}}\n{{Wikipedia books|Auto racing in North America}}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Auto racing by type]]\n[[Category:Stock car racing]]\n[[Category:Open wheel racing]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the variant of cycling|Track cycling}}\n{{short description|Form of auto racing where competitors duel on an oval shaped track}}\n\n'''Oval track racing''' is a form of closed-circuit [[motorsport|automobile racing]] that is contested on an oval-shaped track. An oval track differs from a [[Road racing|road course]] in that the layout resembles an [[oval]] with turns in only one direction, and the direction of traffic is almost universally counter-clockwise. Oval tracks are dedicated motorsport circuits, used predominantly in the United States. They often have [[banked turn]]s and some, despite the name, are not precisely oval, and the shape of the track can vary.\n[[Image:Martinsville Backstretch.JPG|right|thumb|350px|[[Martinsville Speedway]], a symmetrical oval, following a race.]]\n\nMajor forms of oval track racing include [[stock car racing]], [[open-wheel|open-wheel racing]], [[sprint car racing]], [[modified car racing]], [[midget car racing]] and [[Track racing|dirt track motorcycles]].\n\nOval track racing is the predominant form of auto racing in the United States. According to the 2013 National Speedway Directory, the total number of oval tracks, drag strips and road courses in the United States is 1,262, with 901 of those being oval tracks and 683 of those being dirt tracks. Among the most famous oval tracks in North America are the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]], [[Daytona International Speedway]] and [[Talladega Superspeedway]].\n\nNotable ovals in other countries include [[Aut\u00f3dromo Ciudad de Rafaela|Rafaela]] in Argentina, [[Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez|Mexico City]] in Mexico, [[Twin Ring Motegi|Motegi]] in Japan, [[EuroSpeedway Lausitz|Lausitzring]] in Germany, the [[Calder Park Thunderdome]] in Australia, [[Brooklands]] and [[Rockingham Motor Speedway|Rockingham]] in the United Kingdom, [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]] in Italy, and [[Autodrome de Linas-Montlh\u00e9ry|Montlh\u00e9ry]] in France.\n\n== Oval racing ==\n\n===Pack racing===\n[[File:Three-wide multiple row back.JPG|thumb|right|350px|Pack racing at [[Daytona International Speedway]].]]\nPack racing is a phenomenon found on fast, high-banked superspeedways. It occurs when the vehicles racing are cornering at their limit of [[aerodynamic drag]], but within their limit of [[Traction (engineering)|traction]]. This allows drivers to race around the track constantly at [[wide open throttle]]. Since the vehicles are within their limit of traction, [[Drafting (racing)|drafting]] through corners will not hinder a vehicle's performance. As cars running together are faster than cars running individually, all cars in the field will draft each other simultaneously in one large pack. In [[stock car racing]] this is often referred to as \"[[restrictor plate racing]]\" because [[NASCAR]] mandates that each car on its two longest high-banked ovals, [[Talladega Superspeedway|Talladega]] and [[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]], use an [[air restrictor]] to reduce [[horsepower]].\n\nThe results of pack racing may vary. As drivers are forced to race in a confined space, [[overtaking]] is very common as vehicles may travel two and three abreast. This forces drivers to use strong mental discipline in negotiating traffic. There are drawbacks, however. Should an accident occur at the front of the pack, the results could block the track in a short amount of time. This leaves drivers at the back of the pack with little time to react and little room to maneuver. The results are often catastrophic as numerous cars may be destroyed in a single accident. This type of accident is often called \"[[The Big One (NASCAR)|The Big One]]\".<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/motorsports/nascar_plus/news/2001/04/20/strategy_fish/ CNNSI]\"Hangin' Back\" retrieved November 17, 2007</ref>\n\n===Comparison with road racing===\nOval track racing requires different tactics than road racing. While the driver doesn't have to shift gears nearly as frequently, brake as heavily or as often, or deal with turns of various radii in both directions as in road racing, drivers are still challenged by negotiating the track. Where there is generally one preferred line around a road course, there are many different lines which can work on an oval track. The preferred line depends on many factors including track conditions, car set-up, and traffic. The oval track driver must choose which line to use each time he approaches a corner. On a short track in a 25 lap feature race, a driver might not run any two laps with the same line. Both types of racing place physical demands on the driver. A driver in an [[IndyCar Series|IndyCar]] race at [[Richmond International Raceway]] may be subject to as many lateral [[g-force]]s (albeit in only one direction) as a [[Formula One]] driver at [[Istanbul Park]].\n\nWeather also plays a different role in each discipline. Road racing offers a variety of fast and slow corners that allow the use of [[rain tire]]s. Paved oval tracks generally don't run with a wet track surface. Dirt ovals will sometimes support a light rain. Some tracks (e.g., Evergreen Speedway in Monroe, WA) have \"rain or shine\" rules requiring races to be run in rain.\n\nSafety has also been a point of difference between the two. While a road course usually has abundant [[run-off area]]s, gravel traps, and tire barriers, oval tracks usually have a concrete retaining wall separating the track from the fans. Innovations have been made to change this, however. The [[SAFER barrier]] was created to provide a less dangerous alternative to a traditional concrete wall. The barrier can be retrofitted onto an existing wall or may take the place of a concrete wall completely.\n\n==Track classification (size)==\n[[Image:West row stadium.jpg|thumb|right|275px|A dirt oval track]]\nOval tracks are classified based upon their size, surface, banking, and shape.  Their size can range from only a few hundred feet to over two and a half miles.  Track surfaces can be [[Dirt track racing|dirt]], concrete, asphalt, or a combination of concrete and asphalt. Some ovals in the early twentieth century had [[board track racing|wood]] surfaces.\n\nThe definitions used to differentiate track sizes have changed over the years. While some tracks use terms such as \"speedway\" or \"superspeedway\" in their name, they may not meet the specific definitions used in this article.\n\n==={{Visible anchor|Short track}}===\n[[File:Bristol Motor Speedway in Bristol.jpg|thumb|[[Bristol Motor Speedway]], a short oval]]\nA short track is an oval track less than one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) long, with the majority being 0.5 miles (0.8&nbsp;km) or shorter. Drivers seeking careers in oval track racing generally serve their apprenticeship on short tracks before moving up to series which compete on larger tracks. Due to their short length and fast action, these tracks are often nicknamed \"[[bullring]]s\". Professional-level NASCAR races on short tracks usually use a 500-lap or 400-lap distance. Short tracks in many cases have lights installed and routinely host night races. The short ovals still form the backbone of NASCAR in the feeder series. Three race tracks of this type are also represented in the Cup: Bristol, Martinsville and Richmond. At the request of some fans on social media, there are plans to hold more races on this oval type in the future. Tracks with potential for future cup races are the Iowa Speedway built in 2006, the Nashville Fairgrounds Speedway used until 1984 in the Cup, and the Memphis Motorsports Park, which had races of the Busch Series back then until the 2000s.\n\n==={{Visible anchor|Mile oval}}===\nSynonymous with the name, a 1-mile (1.61&nbsp;km) oval is a popular and common length for oval track racing. The exact measurements, however, can vary by as much as a tenth of a mile and still fall into this category. Most mile ovals are relatively flat-banked, with [[Dover International Speedway|Dover]] being a notable exception. In NASCAR, the 1-mile oval tracks are among the intermediate tracks. IndyCar rated this tracks as short ovals, since they usually do not run on ovals shorter than 3/4 of a mile. The one-mile ovals have lost a great deal of their former importance for oval racing. Most of the racetracks abandoned by NASCAR or IndyCar in the 2000s were of this type. These include the Chicago Motor Speedway and the Walt Disney World Speedway, which were build during the 1990th construction boom but only used for 4 years. The historic Nazareth Speedway, which was paved in 1986, was completely abandoned after the 2004 season. Physically, the Milwaukee Mile, the oldest oval race track in the world, as well as the Rockingham Speedway and the Pikes Peak Raceway still exist. However, these racetracks have not been used by nationally important motorsports events for years. There are only three one milers left in the NASCAR racing calendar: Phoenix, Loudon and Dover. IndyCar has not been driving an oval of this length since 2018.\n\n==={{Visible anchor|Intermediate}}===\n[[File:Nascarvegas03.jpg|thumb|[[Las Vegas Motor Speedway]]]]\nAlso referred to with the general term of \"speedway\", these courses are 1 to 2 miles (1.6 to 3.2&nbsp;km) in length, but the term is particularly reserved for 1.5-mile (2.4&nbsp;km) tracks. At the beginning of the history of NASCAR and IndyCar, this oval size was not very common. Until 1990 there were only five examples: Two of these, the Marchbanks Speedway (1.4 miles) and the Trenton Speedway (1.5 miles), were demolished in the 1970s and 1980s. Only three of them, Charlotte Motor Speedway, Atlanta Motor Speedway and Darlington Raceway have survived to this day. All other ovals of this type were built after 1994. During the race track construction boom of the late 1990s, these tracks began to be labeled with the rather derogatory term \"cookie cutter\" tracks, as their differences were perceived to be minimal. \nIn 1992, [[Charlotte Motor Speedway|Charlotte]] became the first intermediate track to install lights and allow for night racing. It is now commonplace for these types of tracks to host night races. Intermediate tracks usually have moderate to steep banking. Almost all modern race tracks that are still used in NASCAR and IndyCar today are of this type. Since their size allows them to compromise high speeds with sightlines, especially tri- and quad-ovals of 1.5 mile length have become commonplace in major racing series that use oval tracks.\n\n==={{Visible anchor|Superspeedway}}===\nA superspeedway is at least 2.0 miles (3.2&nbsp;km) in length.  There are seven superspeedways in the United States, the most famous being [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] and [[Daytona International Speedway]], both {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} long.

Michigan Speeway was part of the series from 2002 to 2007, AutoClub Speedway from 2002 to 2005 and a second time from 2012 to 2015, Pocono was used by IndyCar between 2014 and 2019. In NASCAR they are still an essential part of the racing calendar.\n\nThe seventh superspeedway is [[Texas World Speedway]], which is the original \"sister track\" to Michigan. The two-mile oval, with its 22-degree banking, was the site of Mario Andretti's closed-course record of {{convert|214.158|mph|km/h|3|abbr=on}} which stood for 12 years. No major professional series have raced at TWS since the 1990s, however, the track's 1.8, 2.9 and 3.1-mile road courses are very popular with amateur racing clubs.\n\n== Track classification (shape) ==\nA typical oval track consists of two parallel straights, connected by two 180\u00b0 turns. Although most ovals generally have only two radii curves, they are usually advertised and labeled as four 90\u00b0 turns. While many oval tracks conform to the traditional symmetrical design, asymmetrical tracks are not uncommon.\n\n=== Classical geometric shapes ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! width=10%|Shape !! width=50%|Description !! width=40% colspan=\"4\"|Examples\n|-\n! !! !! Short Track !! Mile Oval !! Intermediate !! Superspeedway\n|-\n| Paper clip oval || One sub-classification of the traditional oval shape is the \"paper clip\" oval. The layout consists of two long straights, connected by two sharp, tight-radius turns, giving the track a shape resembling a [[paper clip]]. The courses are usually very challenging, and usually offer little banking, making the turns very slow and tight to maneuver. This is the classic layout of short tracks or mile ovals. Most short tracks are paper clips. But there exist some tracks about 1 mile length with this shape, too. || [[File:Martinsville_Speedway_track_map.png|left|thumb|100px|[[Martinsville Speedway]]]]|| [[File:Chicago Motor Speedway.svg|left|thumb|100px|[[Chicago Motor Speedway]]]]||[[File:Ovalo Miguel E.

In contrast to the paperclip, the straight lines are relatively short compared to the curves. It is the form closest to a circle. The curves usually shows a high banking. || [[File:Bristol_Motor_Speedway_map.png|left|thumb|100px|[[Bristol Motor Speedway]]]] || [[File:Dover International Speedway.PNG|left|thumb|100px|[[Dover International Speedway]]]]||[[File:Homestead-Miami Speedway track map--Speedway.svg|left|thumb|100px|[[Homestead-Miami Speedway|Homestead (altered design)]]]]\n|-\n| Rounded-off rectangle or square || One prominent, but now uncommon shape is the \"rounded-off rectangle\". Pursuant to its name, the track shape resembles a rectangle, with two long straights and two short straights, connected by four separate turns. The primary characteristic of a rounded-off rectangle that differentiates it from a traditional oval shape, is the presence of two \"short chutes\", one between turns one and two, and one between turns three and four. While most traditional ovals have two continuous 180\u00b0 radii (advertised as four 90\u00b0 turns), this shape actually has four distinct 90\u00b0 curves.  When it was first constructed, the Homestead-Miami Speedway was designed to this layout and touted as a \"mini-Indy.\" However, at only 1.5 miles (one mile shorter than Indy), the track proved to be uncompetitive, owing largely to the sharp corners, and was soon reconfigured as a traditional oval. Indianapolis remains as the only major track to this specification. Tracks of this shape have been avoided due to grandstand sight line issues, slow corners, and dangerous impact angles. However, numerous private manufacturers' test tracks use this type of layout. The only major short track with a rectangular layout has the shape of a rounded-off square with four nearly identical straights and turns. || [[File:FlemingtonSpeedwayMap.svg|left|thumb|100px|[[Flemington Speedway]], a square]] || - ||[[File:Homestead-Miami Speedway track map--Speedway.svg|left|thumb|120x120px|[[Homestead\u2013Miami Speedway|Homestead-Miami Speedway]]]]||[[File:Indianapolis Oval.svg|thumb|100px|left|[[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]]]]\n|-\n| Rounded-off trapezoid || A very rare layout is a trapezoid oval course. The difference to rounded-off rectangle is the shorter back straight and longer front straight. So, the Turns 1 and 4 are tighter than the Turns 2 and 3.  || - || - || [[File:Jacarepagu\u00e1-oval.svg|left|thumb|100px|[[Emerson Fittipaldi Speedway]]]] || -\n|-\n| Rounded-off triangle || The classic triangular layout is rare in oval courses, too.

In the strict sense, the modern oval tracks are called tri-oval, which rather are similar to a '''D'''. <small>See next section.</small> The Pocono Raceway is a triangular course with three distinct, widely varying turns. Due to its layout the \"Pocono Raceway\" is often described with the words: \"It is an oval course, which drives like a road course.\" The triangle is a popular oval shape outside the United States. There are some triangular oval tracks in Canada, Germany and Mexico. || [[File:Sanair_Super_Speedway_map.svg|left|thumb|100px|[[Sanair Super Speedway]], an equilateral triangle]] || - || [[File:Marchbanks_Speedway_(Hanford_Motor_Speedway)_map.svg|left|thumb|75px|[[Marchbanks Speedway]]]] || [[File:Pocono_Raceway.svg|left|thumb|100px|[[Pocono Raceway]]]]\n|-\n|}\n\nAdditional prominent examples:<gallery>\nFile:EvergreenSpeedway.svg|[[Evergreen Speedway]]\nFile:NashvilleSpeedwayMap.svg|[[Fairgrounds Speedway]]\nFile:IndianapolisRacewayParkMap.svg|[[Indianapolis Raceway Park|Indianapolis Raceway]]\nFile:MesaMarinSpeedwayMap.svg|[[Mesa Marin Raceway|Mesa Marin Speedway]]\nFile:USA International Speedway - Lakeland Fl.svg|[[USA International Speedway]]\nFile:ThompsonInternationalSpeedwayMap.svg|[[Thompson Speedway Motorsports Park|Thompson International Speedway]]\nFile:NorthWilkesboroSpeedwayMap.svg|[[North Wilkesboro Speedway]]\nFile:Milmilelayout.PNG|[[Milwaukee Mile]]\nFile:New Hampshire Motor Speedway.PNG|[[New Hampshire Motor Speedway]]\nFile:SalemSpeedwayMap.svg|[[Salem Speedway]]\nFile:Rockingham Motor Speedway.png|[[Rockingham Motor Speedway]]\nFile:EuroSpeedway Lausitz tri-oval diagram.svg|[[EuroSpeedway Lausitz]]\nFile:Tri\u00f3valo Bernardo Obreg\u00f3n.png|[[Tri\u00f3valo Bernardo Obreg\u00f3n]]\nFile:Atlanta International Speedway.svg|[[Atlanta Motor Speedway|Atlanta International Speedway]]\nFile:NorthWilkesboroSpeedwayMap.svg|[[:File:NorthWilkesboroSpeedwayMap.svg|North Wilkesboro Speedway]]\n</gallery>\n\n=== Tri-ovals ===\n{{main|Tri-oval}}\n\nThe tri-oval is the common shape of the ovals from the construction booms of the 1960s and 1990s. The use of the tri-oval shape for automobile racing was conceived by [[Bill France, Sr.]] during the planning for Daytona. The triangular layout allowed fans in the grandstands an angular perspective of the cars coming towards and moving away from their vantage point. Traditional ovals (such as [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway|Indianapolis]]) offered only limited linear views of the course, and required fans to look back and forth much like a tennis match. The tri-oval shape prevents fans from having to \"lean\" to see oncoming cars, and creates more forward sight lines. The modern tri-ovals were often called as ''cookie cutters'' because of their (nearly) identical shape and identical kind of races.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! width=10%|Shape !! width=50%|Description !! width=40% colspan=\"4\"|Examples\n|-\n! !! !! Short Track !! Mile Oval !! Intermediate !! Superspeedway\n|-\n| Tri-oval || A tri-oval resembles an isosceles triangle with rounded-off corners. The circuits typically have a straight backstretch, while the main straightaway where the pit area and most grandstands are located, has a \"tri-oval\" curve (sometimes characterized as a fifth curve) that makes the mainstretch skewed. Tri-ovals have become preferable to track builders as they offer superior sightlines. Generally on tri-ovals the start-finish line is located on the apex of the tri-oval curve. Two exceptions are Talladega and Walt Disney World Speedway, where the start-finish line are located on the straight between the curve and turn one.  || - || [[File:Walt_Disney_World_Speedway_diagram.svg|left|thumb|100px|[[Walt Disney World Speedway]]]] ||[[File:Las_Vegas_Motor_Speedway_diagram.svg|left|thumb|100px|The [[Las Vegas Motor Speedway]]]] || [[File:Daytona International Speedway.svg|left|thumb|100px|[[Daytona International Speedway]]]]<br />\n|-\n| Quad-oval || A tri-oval with a \"double dogleg\" is often called a \"quad-oval\". A quad-oval is very similar to a tri-oval in sightlines and layout. One specific feature is that the start-finish line segment actually falls on a straight section, rather than along a curve. The shape has become a signature for [[Speedway Motorsports]], which owns all major quad-ovals in the United States. The [[Calder Park Thunderdome]] in [[Melbourne]], Australia, is also an example of a quad-oval speedway, though since its opening in 1987 it has generally been referred to as a tri-oval. || [[File:Birmingham_Interational_Raceway.svg|left|thumb|50px|[[Birmingham International Raceway]]]] || - || [[File:Charlotte_Motor_Speedway_diagram.svg|left|thumb|100px|[[Charlotte Motor Speedway]]]] || -\n|-\n| D-shaped oval || A variation of tri-oval is the \"D-shaped oval\". Similar to a tri-oval, a D-shaped oval has a straight backstretch, but a long, sweeping frontstretch, giving the circuit a layout resembling the letter ''D''. The shape originated with a pair of sister tracks built in the 1960s: Michigan International Speedway and Texas World Speedway. Initially, this design has been used only for superspeedways. But there are now some short tracks with this shape, too. ||[[File:Richmond International Speedway.png|left|thumb|100px|[[Richmond Raceway|Richmond (International) Raceway]]]] || [[File:Rockingham Speedway.svg|left|thumb|100px|[[Rockingham Speedway]]]] || - || <br />[[File:Michigan International Speedway track map.png|left|thumb|100px|[[Michigan International Speedway]]]]\n|-\n|}\n\nAdditional prominent examples:<gallery>\nFile:Chicagoland Speedway diagram.svg|[[Chicagoland Speedway]]\nFile:Kansas Speedway diagram.svg|[[Kansas Speedway]]\nFile:Kentucky Speedway.svg|[[Kentucky Speedway]]\nFile:Nashville Superspeedway diagram.svg|[[Nashville Superspeedway]]\nFile:Phakisa Freeway - Speedway.svg|[[Phakisa Freeway]]\nFile:Atlanta Motor Speedway.svg|[[Atlanta Motor Speedway]]\nFile:TexasMotorSpeedway.svg|[[Texas Motor Speedway]]\nFile:Calder Park (Australia) track map--Thunderdome Speedway.svg|[[Calder Park Raceway|Calder Park Thunderdome Superspeedway]]\nFile:Ovalo de Chiapas.png|[[Aut\u00f3dromo Chiapas|Autodromo Chiapas]]\nFile:Ovalo Aguascalientes.png|[[Ovalo Aguascalientes M\u00e9xico|Ovalo Aguascalientes]]\nFile:Iowa Speedway track map.png|[[Iowa Speedway]]\nFile:Memphis International Raceway diagram.svg|[[Memphis International Raceway]]\nFile:MyrtleBeachSpeedwayMap.png|[[Myrtle Beach Speedway]]\nFile:Pikes Peak International Raceway.svg|[[Pikes Peak International Raceway]]\nFile:Auto Club Speedway (formerly California Speedway) - Speedway.svg|[[Auto Club Speedway]]\nFile:Texas World Speedway-Superspeedway.svg|[[Texas World Speedway]]\nFile:Talladega Superspeedway.svg|[[Talladega Superspeedway]]\n</gallery>\n\n=== Unique shapes ===\nThere are a lot of oval tracks, which neither have a classical geometric shape nor still represent a modern tri-oval in the strict sense. <!--The term \"Roval\" has been used to loosely describe an oval track with an asymmetrical, unusual, or [[rectangle|oblong]] shape, or atypical features {{cn|no google results|date=July 2016}}. The name is a [[portmanteau]] of \"road course\" and \"oval.\" --> While these courses still technically fall under the category of ovals, their unique shape, flat corners, hard braking zones, or increased difficulty, often produces driving characteristics similar to those of a road course.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! width=20%| Shape !! width=60%| Description !! width=20%|Examples\n|-\n| Egg-shape || There are some tracks, which were planned as a classic ovals, but had to be built for reasons of space in egg shape. An egg-shaped oval substantially corresponds to the classical form, however, the two straights are non-parallel arranged. A straight line is slightly longer than the other and the two curves have different radii. ||[[File:Darlington_raceway.svg|thumb|100px| [[Darlington Raceway]]|alt=|center]]\n|-\n| Dogleg || Some oval tracks have minor variations, such as kinks or doglegs. A \"dogleg\" is a defined as a soft curve down one of the straights, either inward or outward, which skews the oval into a non-symmetric or non-traditional shape. While the extra curve would seemingly give the oval five turns, the dogleg is normally omitted from identification, and the ovals are still labeled with four turns. ||[[File:Nazareth Speedway Trackmap.png|thumb|100px|[[Nazareth Speedway]]|alt=|center]]\n|-\n| Kidney-bean-shape || A Kidney-bean-shape had a unique right-hand dogleg.

The now defunct [[Ascot Speedway]] featured 1/2 mile and 1/4 mile dirt oval tracks, and [[Irwindale Speedway]] features 1/2 mile and 1/3 mile concentric paved oval tracks. Pocono Raceway once had a 3/4 mile oval which connected to the main stretch, and circled around the garage area.\n\nIn 1991, Charlotte Motor Speedway connected the quad oval start-finish straight to the pit lane with two 180 degree turns, resulting in a concentric 1/4-mile oval layout. The 1/4-mile layout became a popular venue for [[legends car racing]]. The name \"legends oval\" was derived from this use. They have also seen use with go-karts, short track stock cars, and other lower disciplines. This idea was adopted by numerous tracks including Texas Motor Speedway, Atlanta Motor Speedway, [[Kentucky Speedway]], [[Las Vegas Motor Speedway]], and [[Iowa Speedway]] which has a 1/8 mile version.\n\nPerhaps the most unusual concentric oval facility is Dover Speedway-[[Dover Downs]]. The one-mile oval track encompasses a 0.625-mile [[Horse racing|harness racing]] track inside.\n\n==Track classification (banking)==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F003014-0010, Berlin, Autorennen auf der Avus.jpg|thumb|right|300px|41\u00b0 banking of [[AVUS]], Germany]]\n[[File:Monza banking 2003.JPG|thumb|right|300px|38.69\u00b0 banking of [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]], Italy]]\nOval tracks usually have slope in both straight and in curves, but the slope on the straights is less, circuits without any slope are rare to find, low-slope are usually old or small tracks, high gradient are more common in new circuits.\n\nCircuits like [[Milwaukee Mile]] and [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] are approximately 9\u00b0 tilt in curves are considered low slope, superspeedways like [[Talladega Superspeedway|Talladega]] have up to 33\u00b0 of tilt in curves, [[Daytona International Raceway|Daytona]] has up to 32\u00b0, both are considered high inclination. [[Charlotte Motor Speedway|Charlotte]] and [[Dover International Speedway|Dover]] are the intermediate with the highest bank, 24\u00b0 tilt.

It\u2019s a ROVAL, and it\u2019s in Charlotte. |author= C Jackson Cowart |date= 23 May 2017 |publisher= Charlotte Observer }}</ref>) is an oval track racing facility that features a road course in the infield (or outfield), that is usually linked to the oval circuit. This type of course makes for a multi-purpose track, and allows the facility to be used for both oval and road racing. A typical combined road course consists of the oval portion of the track, using the same start/finish line, and same pit area, but a mid-course diversion to a winding road circuit in the infield (or outfield). At some point, the circuit leads back to the main oval, and completes the rest of the lap. On some of the faster ovals, a [[chicane]] is present on long back-straights, to keep speeds down, and create additional braking/passing zones. Some more complex facilities feature a stand-alone road course layout(s) in the infield not directly linked to the oval layout, or otherwise using only a short portion of the oval.\n\nCombined road courses combine the high speed characteristics of ovals with the technical precision of [[road racing|road courses]]. It allows road racing disciplines the unique experience of being held in the stadium style atmosphere of an oval superspeedway. Numerous combined road courses saw widespread use with sports cars in the 1970s and early 1980s. However, their use has since diminished considerably, since most layouts lacked the desirable topography and competitive challenges of natural road courses. In addition, most combined road course circuits offer poor sightlines for fans sitting in the grandstands. Oftentimes the challenging infield portion is obscured or not visible at all from the grandstands that line the circumference of the oval track, so many fans choose to view from the ground level inside the infield - leaving the grandstands mostly empty and unsightly.\n\nMany combined road course layouts have been abandoned, or are only used for testing and [[Sports Car Club of America|amateur race meets]]. Since 1962, the most famous race continuously held on a combined road course has been the [[24 Hours of Daytona]].\n\nIn 2018 [[NASCAR]] held the [[Bank of America Roval 400]] on a combined course at the [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]].\n\nIn some rare examples, the combined road course layout is run in the opposite direction as the oval circuit. For instance, at [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway|Indianapolis]] the oval is run counter-clockwise, but the combined road course used during the [[IndyCar Series]] [[Grand Prix of Indianapolis]] is run clockwise. However the  [[Indianapolis motorcycle Grand Prix|Moto GP]]  races were run counter-clockwise, with some reconfigured corners to fix corner apex problems. [[Michigan International Speedway|Michigan]] was also an example of a clockwise combined road course. Another example is the [[Adelaide International Raceway]] in [[Australia]] which combines a 2.41&nbsp;km (1.50&nbsp;mi) road course with an 0.805&nbsp;km (0.500&nbsp;mi) speedway bowl. The Bowl forms a permanent part of the road course and also runs clockwise. At many tracks, multiple configurations are available for the combined road course layout(s).\n\nAn example of an outfield combined road course can be seen at the [[Calder Park Raceway]] in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. The Calder Park complex has a 1.119&nbsp;mi (1.801&nbsp;km) high-banked oval speedway called the Thunderdome as well as a separate road course. The road course and the oval can be linked via two short roads that connect the front straight of the road course to the back straight of the oval. As they are separate tracks, this creates a unique situation where different races can actually be run on both the oval and the full road course at the same time. Also unique is that unlike most combined circuits which use the oval track's start/finish line and pits, in the case of Calder Park it is the road course start/finish line and pits that are used.
