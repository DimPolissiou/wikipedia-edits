This is an [[epicuticular wax]] coating and is known as \"wax bloom\".

The commercially important plum trees are medium-sized, usually pruned to 5\u20136 metres height. The tree is of medium hardiness.<ref>{{cite web|title=Plum, prune, European type|publisher=Purdue University|year=1999|url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/Crops/Plum_prune.html|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412183755/http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/Crops/Plum_prune.html|archivedate=2012-04-12}}</ref> Without pruning, the trees can reach 12 metres in height and spread across 10 metres. They blossom in different months in different parts of the world; for example, in about January in Taiwan and early April in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Prunus+domestica|title=Prunus domestica Plum, European plum PFAF Plant Database|work=pfaf.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122110734/http://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Prunus+domestica|archivedate=2012-11-22}}</ref>\n\nFruits are usually of medium size, between 2 and 7 centimetres in diameter, globose to oval. The flesh is firm and juicy. The fruit's peel is smooth, with a natural waxy surface that adheres to the flesh. The plum is a [[drupe]], meaning its fleshy fruit surrounds a single hard seed.\n[[File:Plum blossom on the first day of spring - geograph.org.uk - 1214413.jpg|thumb|Plum flowers]]\n\n==Cultivation and uses==\n[[File:Closeup of blackthorn aka sloe aka prunus spinosa sweden 20050924.jpg|thumb|Sloe or blackthorn, ''Prunus spinosa'']]\n\nPlum [[cultivar]]s include:\n* [[Damson]] (purple or black skin, green flesh, clingstone, astringent)\n* [[Greengage]] (firm, green flesh and skin even when ripe)\n* [[Mirabelle Plum|Mirabelle]] (dark yellow, predominantly grown in northeast [[France]])\n* [[Satsuma plum]] (firm red flesh with a red skin)\n* [[Victoria plum|Victoria]] (yellow flesh with a red or mottled skin)\n* [[Yellowgage (plum)|Yellowgage]] or golden plum (similar to greengage, but yellow)\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Different plum cultivars\">\nFile:Slivka.JPG|Damsons\nFile:Greengages 0.jpg|Greengages\nFile:Mirabellen.jpg|Mirabelles\nFile:Prunus domestica 'Reine Victoria'.jpg|Victoria plums\n</gallery>\n\nWhen it flowers in the early spring, a plum tree will be covered in [[blossom]]s, and in a good year approximately 50% of the flowers will be pollinated and become plums. Flowering starts after 80 [[growing degree day]]s.\n\nIf the weather is too dry, the plums will not develop past a certain stage, but will fall from the tree while still tiny, green buds, and if it is unseasonably wet or if the plums are not harvested as soon as they are ripe, the fruit may develop a fungal condition called [[Monilinia fructicola|brown rot]]. Brown rot is not toxic, and some affected areas can be cut out of the fruit, but unless the rot is caught immediately, the fruit will no longer be edible. Plum is used as a food plant by the [[larva]]e of some [[Lepidoptera]], including [[November moth]], [[willow beauty]] and [[short-cloaked moth]].\n[[File:970718-DriedGoldenPlum-IMG 7527-2.jpg|thumb|Dried yellow plums]]\n\nThe taste of the plum fruit ranges from sweet to tart; the skin itself may be particularly tart.  It is juicy and can be eaten fresh or used in [[jam]]-making or other recipes. Plum juice can be fermented into [[plum wine]]. In central England, a cider-like alcoholic beverage known as [[plum jerkum]] is made from plums. Dried, salted plums are used as a snack, sometimes known as ''[[saladitos|saladito]]'' or ''salao''. Various flavors of dried plum are available at Chinese grocers and specialty stores worldwide. They tend to be much drier than the standard prune. Cream, [[ginseng]], spicy, and salty are among the common varieties. [[Licorice]] is generally used to intensify the flavor of these plums and is used to make salty plum drinks and toppings for [[slush (beverage)|shaved ice]] or ''[[baobing]]''. Pickled plums are another type of preserve available in Asia and international specialty stores. The Japanese variety, called ''[[umeboshi]]'', is often used for rice balls, called ''onigiri'' or ''omusubi''.  The ''[[ume]]'', from which ''umeboshi'' are made, is more closely related, however, to the [[apricot]] than to the plum. In the [[Balkans]], plum is converted into an alcoholic drink named ''[[slivovitz]]'' (plum brandy) (Serbian: ''[[\u0161ljivovica]]'').<ref>{{cite journal|title=Aroma Constituents of Plum Brandy|author=Crowell and Guymon|journal=[[American Journal of Enology and Viticulture|American Journal of Enology]]|year= 1973|volume= 24|number=4|pages=159\u2013165}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=The neutral volatile components of Czechoslovak plum brandy|author1=Jan Vel\u00ed\u0161ek |author2=Franti\u0161ek Pudil |author3=Ji\u0159\u00ed Dav\u00eddek |author4=Vladislav Kubelka |journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Lebensmittel-Untersuchung und -Forschung A|volume= 174|number= 6|year=1982|pages= 463\u2013466|doi= 10.1007/BF01042726}}</ref> A large number of plums, of the Damson variety, are also grown in Hungary, where they are called ''szilva'' and are used to make ''[[lekvar]]'' (a plum paste jam), ''[[palinka]]'' (traditional fruit brandy), plum dumplings, and other foods.\n\nAs with many other members of the [[Rosaceae|rose family]], plum kernels contain [[Glycosides#Cyanogenic glycosides|cyanogenic glycosides]], including [[amygdalin]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Burrows, G.E. |author2=Tyrl, R.J. |date=2012 |title= Toxic Plants of North America |chapter= Rosaceae Juss. |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell  |pages= 1064\u20131094}}</ref> Prune kernel oil is made from the fleshy inner part of the pit of the plum.

The commercially important plum trees are medium-sized, usually pruned to 5\u20136 metres height. The tree is of medium hardiness.<ref>{{cite web|title=Plum, prune, European type|publisher=Purdue University|year=1999|url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/Crops/Plum_prune.html|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412183755/http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/Crops/Plum_prune.html|archivedate=2012-04-12}}</ref> Without pruning, the trees can reach 12 metres in height and spread across 10 metres. They blossom in different months in different parts of the world; for example, in about January in Taiwan and early April in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Prunus+domestica|title=Prunus domestica Plum, European plum PFAF Plant Database|work=pfaf.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122110734/http://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Prunus+domestica|archivedate=2012-11-22}}</ref>\n\nFruits are usually of medium size, between 2 and 7 centimetres in diameter, globose to oval. The flesh is firm and juicy. The fruit's peel is smooth, with a natural waxy surface that adheres to the flesh. The plum is a [[drupe]], meaning its fleshy fruit surrounds a single hard seed.\n[[File:Plum blossom on the first day of spring - geograph.org.uk - 1214413.jpg|thumb|Plum flowers]]\n\n==Cultivation and uses==\n[[File:Closeup of blackthorn aka sloe aka prunus spinosa sweden 20050924.jpg|thumb|Sloe or blackthorn, ''Prunus spinosa'']]\n\nPlum [[cultivar]]s include:\n* [[Damson]] (purple or black skin, green flesh, clingstone, astringent)\n* [[Greengage]] (firm, green flesh and skin even when ripe)\n* [[Mirabelle Plum|Mirabelle]] (dark yellow, predominantly grown in northeast [[France]])\n* [[Satsuma plum]] (firm red flesh with a red skin)\n* [[Victoria plum|Victoria]] (yellow flesh with a red or mottled skin)\n* [[Yellowgage (plum)|Yellowgage]] or golden plum (similar to greengage, but yellow)\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Different plum cultivars\">\nFile:Slivka.JPG|Damsons\nFile:Greengages 0.jpg|Greengages\nFile:Mirabellen.jpg|Mirabelles\nFile:Prunus domestica 'Reine Victoria'.jpg|Victoria plums\n</gallery>\n\nWhen it flowers in the early spring, a plum tree will be covered in [[blossom]]s, and in a good year approximately 50% of the flowers will be pollinated and become plums. Flowering starts after 80 [[growing degree day]]s.\n\nIf the weather is too dry, the plums will not develop past a certain stage, but will fall from the tree while still tiny, green buds, and if it is unseasonably wet or if the plums are not harvested as soon as they are ripe, the fruit may develop a fungal condition called [[Monilinia fructicola|brown rot]]. Brown rot is not toxic, and some affected areas can be cut out of the fruit, but unless the rot is caught immediately, the fruit will no longer be edible. Plum is used as a food plant by the [[larva]]e of some [[Lepidoptera]], including [[November moth]], [[willow beauty]] and [[short-cloaked moth]].\n[[File:970718-DriedGoldenPlum-IMG 7527-2.jpg|thumb|Dried yellow plums]]\n\nThe taste of the plum fruit ranges from sweet to tart; the skin itself may be particularly tart.  It is juicy and can be eaten fresh or used in [[jam]]-making or other recipes. Plum juice can be fermented into [[plum wine]]. In central England, a cider-like alcoholic beverage known as [[plum jerkum]] is made from plums. Dried, salted plums are used as a snack, sometimes known as ''[[saladitos|saladito]]'' or ''salao''. Various flavors of dried plum are available at Chinese grocers and specialty stores worldwide. They tend to be much drier than the standard prune. Cream, [[ginseng]], spicy, and salty are among the common varieties. [[Licorice]] is generally used to intensify the flavor of these plums and is used to make salty plum drinks and toppings for [[slush (beverage)|shaved ice]] or ''[[baobing]]''. Pickled plums are another type of preserve available in Asia and international specialty stores. The Japanese variety, called ''[[umeboshi]]'', is often used for rice balls, called ''onigiri'' or ''omusubi''.  The ''[[ume]]'', from which ''umeboshi'' are made, is more closely related, however, to the [[apricot]] than to the plum. In the [[Balkans]], plum is converted into an alcoholic drink named ''[[slivovitz]]'' (plum brandy) (Serbian: ''[[\u0161ljivovica]]'').<ref>{{cite journal|title=Aroma Constituents of Plum Brandy|author=Crowell and Guymon|journal=[[American Journal of Enology and Viticulture|American Journal of Enology]]|year= 1973|volume= 24|number=4|pages=159\u2013165}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=The neutral volatile components of Czechoslovak plum brandy|author1=Jan Vel\u00ed\u0161ek |author2=Franti\u0161ek Pudil |author3=Ji\u0159\u00ed Dav\u00eddek |author4=Vladislav Kubelka |journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Lebensmittel-Untersuchung und -Forschung A|volume= 174|number= 6|year=1982|pages= 463\u2013466|doi= 10.1007/BF01042726}}</ref> A large number of plums, of the Damson variety, are also grown in Hungary, where they are called ''szilva'' and are used to make ''[[lekvar]]'' (a plum paste jam), ''[[palinka]]'' (traditional fruit brandy), plum dumplings, and other foods.\n\nAs with many other members of the [[Rosaceae|rose family]], plum kernels contain [[Glycosides#Cyanogenic glycosides|cyanogenic glycosides]], including [[amygdalin]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Burrows, G.E. |author2=Tyrl, R.J. |date=2012 |title= Toxic Plants of North America |chapter= Rosaceae Juss. |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell  |pages= 1064\u20131094}}</ref> Prune kernel oil is made from the fleshy inner part of the pit of the plum.

Set in [[Albert Square]] in the [[East End of London]] in the fictional borough of [[Walford]], the programme follows the stories of local residents and their families as they go about their daily lives. Initially there were two 30-minute episodes per week, later increasing to three, but since 2001, episodes have been broadcast on every [[weekday]] except Wednesday (outside of special occasions). On 18 March 2020, BBC made the decision to suspend production of the programme until further notice, in addition to reducing the broadcast frequency to two 30-minute episodes per week. This was due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]] with the reduced broadcast frequency being a temporary measure to preserve the ongoing broadcast of filmed episodes.\n\nWithin eight months of the show's launch, it reached the number one spot in [[Broadcaster's Audience Research Board|BARB]]'s TV ratings and has consistently remained among the top rated series in Britain. In 2013, the average audience share for an episode was around 30 per cent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a502337/coronation-street-79m-watch-paul-and-lloyds-showdown.html|title='Coronation Street': 7.9m watch Paul and Lloyd's showdown|website=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=9 August 2015|date=30 July 2013}}</ref> Today, ''EastEnders'' remains a significant programme in terms of the BBC's success and audience share, and also in the history of British television drama, tackling many dilemmas that are considered to be controversial and [[taboo]] issues in [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British culture]] and social life previously unseen on UK mainstream television.<ref>Pamela Demory, Christopher Pullen (2013). \"Queer Love in Film and Television: Critical Essays\". p. 35.

However, delving further into the East End of London, they found exactly what they had been searching for: a real East End spirit\u2014an inward-looking quality, a distrust of strangers and authority figures, a sense of territory and community that the creators summed up as \"Hurt one of us and you hurt us all\".<ref name=\"20years p11\" />\n\nWhen developing ''EastEnders'', both Smith and Holland looked at influential models like ''Coronation Street'', but they found that it offered a rather outdated and nostalgic view of working-class life. Only after ''EastEnders'' began, and featured the characters of [[Tony Carpenter]] and [[Kelvin Carpenter]], did ''Coronation Street'' start to feature black characters, for example.<ref>\"[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2001/02/03/bfpa03.xml Hole at the heart of the BBC]\", ''The Telegraph''.

However this show, which graduated from one showing a week to two in three separate series (the latter series being shown in different time slots across the ITV network) was very different in style and approach from ''EastEnders''. The British Film Institute described ''Market In Honey Lane'' thus: \"It was not an earth-shaking programme, and certainly not pioneering in any revolutionary ideas in technique and production, but simply proposed itself to the casual viewer as a mildly pleasant affair.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Market on Honey Lane / Honey Lane (1967\u201369)|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1400806/index.html|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|accessdate=28 May 2014}}</ref> ''EastEnders'', while also featuring an East End street market, would be very different in its approach and impact.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe target launch date was originally January 1985.<ref name=\"Insidestory p24\">{{Harvnb|Smith|Holland|1987|p=24}}</ref> Smith and Holland had eleven months in which to write, cast and shoot the whole thing. However, in February 1984, they did not even have a title or a place to film. Both Smith and Holland were unhappy about the January 1985 launch date, favouring November or even September 1984 when seasonal audiences would be higher, but the BBC stayed firm, and Smith and Holland had to concede that, with the massive task of getting the Elstree Studios operational, January was the most realistic date.

Jack, Pearl and Tracey Watts were created to bring \"flash, trash, and melodrama\" to the Square (they were later renamed [[Den Watts|Den]], [[Angie Watts|Angie]] and [[Sharon Watts]]). The characters of [[Andy O'Brien (EastEnders)|Andy O'Brien]] and [[Debbie Wilkins]] were created to show a modern couple with outwardly mobile pretensions, and [[Lofty Holloway]] to show an outsider; someone who did not fit in with other residents. It was decided that he would be a former soldier, as Holland's personal experiences of ex-soldiers were that they had trouble fitting into society after being in the army. When they compared the characters they had created, Smith and Holland realised they had created a cross-section of East End residents. The Beale and Fowler family represented the old families of the East End, who had always been there. The Osmans, Jefferys and Carpenters represented the more modern diverse ethnic community of the East End. Debbie, Andy and Mary represented more modern-day individuals.<ref name=\"20years\" />\n\nOnce they had decided on their 23 characters, they returned to London for a meeting with the BBC. Everyone agreed that ''EastEnders'' would be tough, violent on occasion, funny and sharp\u2014set in [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s Britain\u2014and it would start with a bang (namely the death of [[Reg Cox]]). They decided that none of their existing characters were wicked enough to have killed Reg, so a 24th character, [[Nick Cotton]] was added to the line-up. He was a racist thug, who often tried to lead other young characters astray.<ref name=\"20years p20\">{{Harvnb|Smith|2005|p=20}}</ref> When all the characters had been created, Smith and Holland set about casting the actors for the show.\n\n==== Final preparations ====\n[[File:Eastendersearly.jpg|thumb|right|''EastEnders'' original titles sequence, 1985\u20131993|alt=refer to caption]]\nThrough the next few months, the set was growing rapidly at Elstree, and a composer and designer had been commissioned to create the title sequence.

Smith was uneasy about the late start as ''EastEnders'' no longer had the winter months to build up a loyal following before the summer ratings lull. The press were invited to Elstree to meet the cast and see the lot, and stories immediately started circulating about the show, about a rivalry with [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] (who were launching their own market-based soap, ''[[Albion Market]]'') and about the private lives of the cast.<ref name=\"20years page 17\">{{Harvnb|Smith|2005|p=17}}</ref> Anticipation and rumour grew in equal measure until the first transmission at 7{{nbsp}}p.m. on 19 February 1985.<ref name=\"20years page 17\" /> Both Holland and Smith could not watch; they both instead returned to the place where it all began, Albertine's Wine Bar on Wood Lane.<ref name=\"20years page 17\" /> The next day, viewing figures were confirmed at 17{{nbsp}}million.<ref name=\"20years page 17\" /> The reviews were largely favourable,<ref name=\"20years page 17\" /> although, after three weeks on air, BBC1's early evening share had returned to the pre-''EastEnders'' figure of seven million, though ''EastEnders'' then climbed to highs of up to 23{{nbsp}}million later on in the year.<ref name=\"Rating 1986\">{{harvnb|Slide|1996|p=35}}</ref> Following the launch, both group discussions and telephone surveys were conducted to test audience reaction to early episodes.

With public interest so high, the media began investigating the private lives of the show's popular stars. Within days, a scandalous headline appeared \u2013 \"EASTENDERS STAR IS A KILLER\". This referred to [[Leslie Grantham]], and his prison sentence for the murder of a taxi driver in an attempted robbery nearly 20 years earlier.

The early 2000s saw a shift in attention towards the newly introduced female [[Slater family (EastEnders)|Slater clan]], before a renewal of emphasis upon the restored Watts family beginning in 2003. Since 2006, ''EastEnders'' has largely been dominated by the Mitchell, Ahmed and [[Branning family|Branning]] families, though the early 2010s also saw a renewed focus on the Moon family, and from 2013 onwards, on the Carters. In 2014, the [[Fowler family|Fowlers]] were revived and merged with the Slaters, with [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin Fowler]] ([[James Bye (actor)|James Bye]]) marrying [[Stacey Slater]] ([[Lacey Turner]]).

He classed 1989's changes as a brave experiment, and suggested that while some found this period of ''EastEnders'' entertaining, many other viewers felt that the comedy stretched the programme's credibility.<ref name=\"First10Years p70\" /> Although the programme still covered many issues in 1989, such as domestic violence, drugs, rape and racism, Brake reflected that the new emphasis on a more balanced mix between \"light and heavy storylines\" gave the illusion that the show had lost a \"certain edge\".<ref name=\"First10Years p70\" />\n\nAs the show progressed into the 1990s, ''EastEnders'' still featured hard-hitting issues such as [[Mark Fowler]] ([[Todd Carty]]) revealing he was [[HIV]] positive<ref name=\"issues\" /> in 1991, the death of his wife [[Gill Fowler|Gill]] (Susanna Dawson) from an AIDS-related illness in 1992, murder, [[adoption]], [[abortion]], [[Peggy Mitchell]]'s ([[Barbara Windsor]]) battle with [[breast cancer]],<ref name=\"issues\" /> and [[Phil Mitchell]]'s ([[Steve McFadden]]) alcoholism and violence towards wife Kathy.

As noted in the 1994 behind-the-scenes book, ''EastEnders: The First 10 Years'', after filming, tapes were sent to the videotape editor, who then edited the scenes together into an episode. The videotape editor used the director's notes so they knew which scenes the director wanted to appear in a particular episode. The producer might have asked for further changes to be made.<ref name=\"First10Years p142\">{{Harvnb|Brake|1995|p=142}}</ref> The episode was then copied onto [[D-3 (video)|D3 video]]. The final process was to add the audio which included background noise such as a train or a jukebox music and to check it met the [[BBC]]'s technical standard for broadcasting.<ref name=\"First10Years p143\">{{Harvnb|Brake|1995|p=143}}</ref>\n\nSince 2010, ''EastEnders'' no longer uses tapes in the recording or editing process. After footage is recorded, the material is sent digitally to the post production team. The editors then assemble all the scenes recorded for the director to view and note any changes that are needed. The sound team also have the capability to access the edited episode, enabling them to dub the sound and create the final version.<ref name=\"EastEnders Case Study\">{{cite web|title=EastEnders|url=https://www.bbcstudioworks.com/?case_study=eastenders|publisher=[[BBC Studios]]|accessdate=9 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Budgets and costs ===\nAccording to the book ''How to Study Television'', in 1995 ''EastEnders'' cost the BBC \u00a340,000 per episode on average.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sun, Sea, Sex, Sand and Conservatism in the Australian Television Soap Opera|url=http://eprints.qut.edu.au/62594/2/62594.pdf#page=3|publisher=[[Queensland University of Technology]]|accessdate=18 June 2016}}</ref> A 2012 agreement between the BBC, the [[Writers' Guild of Great Britain]] and the Personal Managers' Association set out the pay rate for ''EastEnders'' scripts as \u00a3137.70 per minute of transmission time (\u00a34,131 for 30 minutes), which is 85 per cent of the rate for scripts for other BBC television series.

She regarded ''EastEnders'' as a fundamental assault on the family and morality itself. She made reference to representation of family life and emphasis on psychological and emotional violence within the show. She was also critical of language such as \"bleeding\", \"bloody hell\", \"bastard\" and \"for Christ's sake\". However, Whitehouse also praised the programme, describing [[Michelle Fowler]]'s decision not to have an abortion as a \"very positive storyline\". She also felt that ''EastEnders'' had been cleaned up as a result of her protests, though she later commented that ''EastEnders'' had returned to its old ways. Her criticisms were widely reported in the tabloid press as ammunition in its existing hostility towards the BBC. The stars of ''Coronation Street'' in particular aligned themselves with Mary Whitehouse, gaining headlines such as \"STREETS AHEAD! RIVALS LASH SEEDY EASTENDERS\" and \"CLEAN UP SOAP! Street Star Bill Lashes 'Steamy' EastEnders\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Buckingham|1987|p=129}}</ref>\n\n''EastEnders'' has been criticised for being too violent, most notably during a [[domestic violence]] storyline between [[Little Mo Mitchell|Little Mo Morgan]] ([[Kacey Ainsworth]]) and her husband [[Trevor Morgan (EastEnders)|Trevor Morgan]] ([[Alex Ferns]]). As ''EastEnders'' is shown pre-watershed, there were worries that some scenes in this storyline were too graphic for its audience. Complaints against a scene in which Little Mo's face was pushed in gravy on Christmas Day were upheld by the Broadcasting Standards Council. However, a helpline after this episode attracted over 2000 calls. [[Erin Pizzey]], who became internationally famous for having started one of the first [[Women's shelter|women's refuges]], said that ''EastEnders'' had done more to raise the issue of violence against women in one story than she had done in 25 years.<ref>{{cite web|title=EastEnders: Faith, Morality and Hope in the Community|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/speeches/stories/yorke_stalbans.shtml|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=30 April 2017|date=4 September 2002}}</ref> The character of [[Phil Mitchell]] (played by [[Steve McFadden]] since early 1990) has been criticised on several occasions for glorifying violence and proving a bad role model to children.

Set in [[Albert Square]] in the [[East End of London]] in the fictional borough of [[Walford]], the programme follows the stories of local residents and their families as they go about their daily lives. Initially there were two 30-minute episodes per week, later increasing to three, but since 2001, episodes have been broadcast on every [[weekday]] except Wednesday (outside of special occasions). On 18 March 2020, BBC made the decision to suspend production of the programme until further notice, in addition to reducing the broadcast frequency to two 30-minute episodes per week. This was due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]] with the reduced broadcast frequency being a temporary measure to preserve the ongoing broadcast of filmed episodes.\n\nWithin eight months of the show's launch, it reached the number one spot in [[Broadcaster's Audience Research Board|BARB]]'s TV ratings and has consistently remained among the top rated series in Britain. In 2013, the average audience share for an episode was around 30 per cent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a502337/coronation-street-79m-watch-paul-and-lloyds-showdown.html|title='Coronation Street': 7.9m watch Paul and Lloyd's showdown|website=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=9 August 2015|date=30 July 2013}}</ref> Today, ''EastEnders'' remains a significant programme in terms of the BBC's success and audience share, and also in the history of British television drama, tackling many dilemmas that are considered to be controversial and [[taboo]] issues in [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British culture]] and social life previously unseen on UK mainstream television.<ref>Pamela Demory, Christopher Pullen (2013). \"Queer Love in Film and Television: Critical Essays\". p. 35.

However, delving further into the East End of London, they found exactly what they had been searching for: a real East End spirit\u2014an inward-looking quality, a distrust of strangers and authority figures, a sense of territory and community that the creators summed up as \"Hurt one of us and you hurt us all\".<ref name=\"20years p11\" />\n\nWhen developing ''EastEnders'', both Smith and Holland looked at influential models like ''Coronation Street'', but they found that it offered a rather outdated and nostalgic view of working-class life. Only after ''EastEnders'' began, and featured the characters of [[Tony Carpenter]] and [[Kelvin Carpenter]], did ''Coronation Street'' start to feature black characters, for example.<ref>\"[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2001/02/03/bfpa03.xml Hole at the heart of the BBC]\", ''The Telegraph''.

However this show, which graduated from one showing a week to two in three separate series (the latter series being shown in different time slots across the ITV network) was very different in style and approach from ''EastEnders''. The British Film Institute described ''Market In Honey Lane'' thus: \"It was not an earth-shaking programme, and certainly not pioneering in any revolutionary ideas in technique and production, but simply proposed itself to the casual viewer as a mildly pleasant affair.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Market on Honey Lane / Honey Lane (1967\u201369)|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1400806/index.html|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|accessdate=28 May 2014}}</ref> ''EastEnders'', while also featuring an East End street market, would be very different in its approach and impact.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe target launch date was originally January 1985.<ref name=\"Insidestory p24\">{{Harvnb|Smith|Holland|1987|p=24}}</ref> Smith and Holland had eleven months in which to write, cast and shoot the whole thing.

The early 2000s saw a shift in attention towards the newly introduced female [[Slater family (EastEnders)|Slater clan]], before a renewal of emphasis upon the restored Watts family beginning in 2003. Since 2006, ''EastEnders'' has largely been dominated by the Mitchell, Ahmed and [[Branning family|Branning]] families, though the early 2010s also saw a renewed focus on the Moon family, and from 2013 onwards, on the Carters.

As noted in the 1994 behind-the-scenes book, ''EastEnders: The First 10 Years'', after filming, tapes were sent to the videotape editor, who then edited the scenes together into an episode. The videotape editor used the director's notes so they knew which scenes the director wanted to appear in a particular episode. The producer might have asked for further changes to be made.<ref name=\"First10Years p142\">{{Harvnb|Brake|1995|p=142}}</ref> The episode was then copied onto [[D-3 (video)|D3 video]].

After footage is recorded, the material is sent digitally to the post production team. The editors then assemble all the scenes recorded for the director to view and note any changes that are needed. The sound team also have the capability to access the edited episode, enabling them to dub the sound and create the final version.<ref name=\"EastEnders Case Study\">{{cite web|title=EastEnders|url=https://www.bbcstudioworks.com/?case_study=eastenders|publisher=[[BBC Studios]]|accessdate=9 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Budgets and costs ===\nAccording to the book ''How to Study Television'', in 1995 ''EastEnders'' cost the BBC \u00a340,000 per episode on average.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sun, Sea, Sex, Sand and Conservatism in the Australian Television Soap Opera|url=http://eprints.qut.edu.au/62594/2/62594.pdf#page=3|publisher=[[Queensland University of Technology]]|accessdate=18 June 2016}}</ref> A 2012 agreement between the BBC, the [[Writers' Guild of Great Britain]] and the Personal Managers' Association set out the pay rate for ''EastEnders'' scripts as \u00a3137.70 per minute of transmission time (\u00a34,131 for 30 minutes), which is 85 per cent of the rate for scripts for other BBC television series.

She regarded ''EastEnders'' as a fundamental assault on the family and morality itself. She made reference to representation of family life and emphasis on psychological and emotional violence within the show. She was also critical of language such as \"bleeding\", \"bloody hell\", \"bastard\" and \"for Christ's sake\". However, Whitehouse also praised the programme, describing [[Michelle Fowler]]'s decision not to have an abortion as a \"very positive storyline\". She also felt that ''EastEnders'' had been cleaned up as a result of her protests, though she later commented that ''EastEnders'' had returned to its old ways. Her criticisms were widely reported in the tabloid press as ammunition in its existing hostility towards the BBC. The stars of ''Coronation Street'' in particular aligned themselves with Mary Whitehouse, gaining headlines such as \"STREETS AHEAD! RIVALS LASH SEEDY EASTENDERS\" and \"CLEAN UP SOAP! Street Star Bill Lashes 'Steamy' EastEnders\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Buckingham|1987|p=129}}</ref>\n\n''EastEnders'' has been criticised for being too violent, most notably during a [[domestic violence]] storyline between [[Little Mo Mitchell|Little Mo Morgan]] ([[Kacey Ainsworth]]) and her husband [[Trevor Morgan (EastEnders)|Trevor Morgan]] ([[Alex Ferns]]). As ''EastEnders'' is shown pre-watershed, there were worries that some scenes in this storyline were too graphic for its audience. Complaints against a scene in which Little Mo's face was pushed in gravy on Christmas Day were upheld by the Broadcasting Standards Council. However, a helpline after this episode attracted over 2000 calls. [[Erin Pizzey]], who became internationally famous for having started one of the first [[Women's shelter|women's refuges]], said that ''EastEnders'' had done more to raise the issue of violence against women in one story than she had done in 25 years.<ref>{{cite web|title=EastEnders: Faith, Morality and Hope in the Community|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/speeches/stories/yorke_stalbans.shtml|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=30 April 2017|date=4 September 2002}}</ref> The character of [[Phil Mitchell]] (played by [[Steve McFadden]] since early 1990) has been criticised on several occasions for glorifying violence and proving a bad role model to children.

The semi-official term ''Bulgarian millet'', was used by the Sultan for the first time in 1847, and was his tacit consent to a more ethno-linguistic definition of the Bulgarians as a nation.

The Orthodox Christians were included into the [[Rum Millet]]. Belonging to this Orthodox community grew more important to the common people than their ethnic origins and the Balkan Orthodox people identified themselves simply as Christians. Nevertheless, ethnonymes never disappeared and some form of ethnic identification was preserved as evident from a Sultan's [[Firman]] from 1680, which lists the ethnic groups in the Balkan lands as follows: Greeks (Rum), Albanians (Arnaut), Serbs (Sirf), Vlachs (Eflak) and Bulgarians (Bulgar).<ref>\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0431\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435. \u041a\u044a\u0441\u043d\u043e \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0435 \u0438 \u0412\u044a\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0435, \u0442\u043e\u043c 2, \u0413\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0438 \u0411\u0430\u043a\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0432, TRUD Publishers, 2004, {{ISBN|954-528-467-6}}, \u0441\u0442\u0440. 23. (Bg.)</ref>\n\nDuring the late 18th century, the Enlightenment in Western Europe provided influence for the initiation of the [[National awakening of Bulgaria|National awakening of the Bulgarian people]]. The awakening process met opposition with the [[rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire]] in the early 19th century. According to the proponents of Bulgarian national awakening, Bulgarians were oppressed as an ethnic community not only by the Turks, but also by the [[Greeks]]. They considered the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Greek Patriarchal clergy]] to be the main oppressor. forced Bulgarians to educate their children in Greek schools and imposed Church services exclusively in Greek in order to [[Hellenize]] the Bulgarian population.\n\n===School and Church struggle===\nDuring the early nineteenth century, national elites used ''ethno-linguistic'' principles to differentiate between \"Bulgarian\" and \"Greek\" identity into the Rum millet. Bulgarians wanted to create their own schools in a common modern literary standard.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=1jSg3lxgSy8C&pg=PA134&dq=common+macedonian+bulgarian+language+bulgarian&hl=bg&sa=X&ei=9RJ8UdX9OfKL4gSByoGQDw&ved=0CDsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=common%20macedonian%20bulgarian%20language%20bulgarian&f=false Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Macedonia Historical Dictionaries of Europe], Dimitar Bechev, Scarecrow Press, 2009, {{ISBN|0-8108-6295-6}}, p. 134.</ref> In the Balkans, Bulgarian education stimulated nationalist sentiments in the middle of the 19th century. Most wealthy Bulgarian merchants, sent their children for a secular education, turning some of them into Bulgarian national activists. At that time secular Bulgarian schools were spreading throughout [[Moesia]], Thrace and Macedonia, aided by modern classroom methods. This expanding set of Bulgarian schools began to come into contact with Greek schools setting the stage for nationalist conflict.<ref>For more see: Julian Brooks, The Education Race for Macedonia, 1878\u20141903 in The Journal of Modern Hellenism, Vol 31 (2015) pp. 23\u201358.</ref> \n\nBy the middle of the century, Bulgarian activists shifted their attention from language to religion and started debate on the establishment of a separate Bulgarian church.<ref>From Rum Millet to Greek and Bulgarian Nations: Religious and National Debates in the Borderlands of the Ottoman Empire, 1870\u20131913,  [https://aha.confex.com/aha/2011/webprogram/Paper5169.html Theodora Dragostinova, Ohio State University, 2011, Columbus, OH.]</ref> As a consequence, until the 1870s, the focus of the [[Bulgarian National Revival]] switched to the struggle for a Bulgarian Church, independent from the Patriarchate of Constantinople. Cultural, administrative and even political independence from the Patriarchate could only be obtained through the establishment of a separate millet or ''[[nation]]''. The coordinated actions aimed at the recognition of a separate millet constitute the so-called \"Church Struggle\". The actions were carried out by Bulgarian national leaders and supported by the majority of the Slavic population in today Bulgaria, Eastern Serbia, North Macedonia and Northern Greece.\n\nBulgarians often relied on the Ottoman authorities as allies in their confrontations with the Patriarchists. The Sultan Firman of 1847 was the first official document  was issued, in which the name ''Bulgarian millet'' was mentioned.<ref>History of the Literary Cultures of East-Central Europe, Marcel Cornis-Pope, John Neubauer, John Benjamins Publishing, 2004, {{ISBN|90-272-3453-1}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5pAwqsSyTlsC&pg=PA403&dq=firman+of+sultan+bulgarian+millet&hl=bg&sa=X&ei=01KoUsSeIeT4ygOpuIDoDg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 403.]</ref> In 1849 the Sultan granted the Bulgarian millet the right to construct [[Bulgarian St. Stephen Church|its own church in Istanbul]],<ref>The Establishment of the Balkan National States, 1804\u20131920, Charles Jelavich, Barbara Jelavich, University of Washington Press, 1986, {{ISBN|0-295-80360-6}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LBYriPYyfUoC&pg=PA132&dq=firman+of+sultan+bulgarian+millet&hl=bg&sa=X&ei=01KoUsSeIeT4ygOpuIDoDg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 132.]</ref> The church subsequently hosted the Easter Sunday of 1860 when the autocephalous [[Bulgarian Exarchate]] was first de facto proclaimed.<ref>A Short History of Modern Bulgaria, R.

Scholars argue that the millet system was instrumental to transforming the \nBulgarian Exarchate into an entity that promoted ethnoreligious nationalism amongst Orthodox Bulgarians.<ref name='Bremer' />\n\nOn 11 May 1872 in the Bulgarian St. Stephen Church in Constantinople, which had been closed by the Ecumenical Patriarch's order, the Bulgarian hierarchs, celebrated a liturgy, whereafter the autocephaly of the Bulgarian Church was declared. The decision on the unilateral declaration of [[autocephaly]] by the Bulgarian Church was not accepted by the [[Patriarchate of Constantinople]]. In this way, the term ''[[phyletism]]'' was coined at the Holy pan-Orthodox Synod that met in [[Istanbul]] on 10 August. The Synod issued an official condemnation of  [[Ethnic religion|ecclesiastical nationalism]], and declared on 18 September the  [[Bulgarian schism|Bulgarian Exarchate schismatic]].\n\n===Independence of Bulgaria===\n\nHaving achieved religious independence, Bulgarian nationalists focused on gaining political independence as well.  \nTwo revolutionary movements started to develop in the beginning of the 1870s: the [[Internal Revolutionary Organisation]] and the [[Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee]]. Their armed struggle reached its peak with the [[April Uprising]] which broke out in 1876. It resulted in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u20131878, and led to the [[Liberation of Bulgaria|foundation of the third Bulgarian state]] after the [[Treaty of San Stefano]]. The treaty set up a Principality Bulgaria which territory included the wide area between the Danube and the Balkan mountain range, most of today Eastern Serbia, Northern Thrace, parts of Eastern Thrace and nearly all of Macedonia. At that time the clergy's shifts from the Orthodox to the Catholic Church and vice versa were symptomatic of the foreign powers' game that the clergy got involved after the 1878 [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Berlin Treaty]], that partitioned the stipulated territory of the new Principality. Thus, in the interplay between the Orthodox and the Uniat doctrine, Bulgaria supported the Orthodox Exarchate. [[Russia]] supported Bulgaria. The Greek [[Patriarchate of Constantinople]] supported the [[Greece|Greek]] national idea. France and the [[Austria-Hungary|Habsburg Empire]] supported the Uniats. The Ottoman Empire's attitude was depending on how it had to balance its own interests in the game with the [[Great Powers]].\n\n===Thrace and Macedonia===\nThe ideas of [[Bulgarian nationalism]] grew up in significance, following the [[Congress of Berlin]] which took back the regions of Macedonia and Southern Thrace, returning them under the control of the Ottoman Empire. Also an autonomous Ottoman province, called [[Eastern Rumelia]] was created in [[Northern Thrace]]. As a consequence, the Bulgarian nationalist movement proclaimed as its aim the inclusion of most of Macedonia and Thrace under Greater Bulgaria. Eastern Rumelia was annexed to Bulgaria in 1885 through bloodless revolution. During the early 1890s, two [[Bulgarophile|pro-Bulgarian]] revolutionary organizations active in Macedonia and Southern Thrace were founded: the [[Bulgarian Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Committees]] and the [[Supreme Macedonian-Adrianople Committee]]. The [[Macedonian Slavs]] then, were regarded and self-identified predominantly as [[Macedonian Bulgarians]].<ref>''During the 20th century, Slavo-Macedonian national feeling has shifted. At the beginning of the 20th century, Slavic patriots in Macedonia felt a strong attachment to Macedonia as a multi-ethnic homeland&nbsp;... Most of these Macedonian Slavs also saw themselves as Bulgarians. By the middle of the 20th. century, however Macedonian patriots began to see Macedonian and Bulgarian loyalties as mutually exclusive. Regional Macedonian nationalism had become ethnic Macedonian nationalism&nbsp;... This transformation shows that the content of collective loyalties can shift.''

That was followed by series of conflicts between Greeks and Bulgarians into both regions. The tension were result of the  different concepts of nationality. The Slavic villages became divided into followers of the Bulgarian national movement and so-called ''[[grecomans]].'' The [[Young Turk Revolution]] of 1908 restored the Ottoman Parliament, which had been suspended by the Sultan in 1878. After the Revolution armed factions laid down their arms and joined the legal struggle. The Bulgarians founded the [[Peoples' Federative Party (Bulgarian Section)]] and the [[Union of the Bulgarian Constitutional Clubs]] and participated in Ottoman elections. Soon, the [[Young Turks]] turned increasingly [[Ottomanism|Ottomanist]] and sought to suppress the national aspirations of the various minorities in Macedonia and Thrace.\n\n===Dissolution===\nThe effect of the [[Balkan Wars]] in 1912\u20131913 was the partition of [[Ottoman empire]] territories in Europe, which was followed by an anti-Bulgarian campaign in areas of Macedonia and Thrace, that came under [[Serbia]]n and [[Greece|Greek]] administration.

The semi-official term ''Bulgarian millet'', was used by the Sultan for the first time in 1847, and was his tacit consent to a more ethno-linguistic definition of the Bulgarians as a nation. Officially as a separate Millet in 1860 were recognized the [[Bulgarian Uniat Church|Bulgarian Uniates]], and then in 1870 the [[Bulgarian Exarchate|Bulgarian Orthodox Christians]] (''Eksarhh\u00e2ne-i Millet i Bulgar'').<ref>Evolutionary Theory and Ethnic Conflict\nPraeger Series in Political Communication, Patrick James, David Goetze, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2001, {{ISBN|0-275-97143-0}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=lIpUdr5gRTIC&pg=PA159&dq=bulgarian+millet+national+church&hl=bg&sa=X&ei=afmdUqKaJKaNywOX5YFA&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 159\u2013160.]</ref> At that time the classical Ottoman [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Millet]]-system began to degrade with the continuous identification of the religious creed with ethnic identity and the term ''millet'' was used as a synonym of ''nation''.<ref>Nationalist Exclusion and Ethnic Conflict: Shadows of Modernity, Andreas Wimmer, Cambridge University Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-521-01185-X}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DbMA5o4rweoC&pg=PA171&dq=ottoman+millet+system+nation+RISE+NATIONALISM&hl=bg&sa=X&ei=BTOeUor5B8yshQeviYAI&ved=0CEcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 171\u2013172.]</ref> In this way, in the struggle for recognition of a separate Church, the modern Bulgarian nation was created.<ref>A Concise History of Bulgaria, R.

The Orthodox Christians were included into the [[Rum Millet]]. Belonging to this Orthodox community grew more important to the common people than their ethnic origins and the Balkan Orthodox people identified themselves simply as Christians. Nevertheless, ethnonymes never disappeared and some form of ethnic identification was preserved as evident from a Sultan's [[Firman]] from 1680, which lists the ethnic groups in the Balkan lands as follows: Greeks (Rum), Albanians (Arnaut), Serbs (Sirf), Vlachs (Eflak) and Bulgarians (Bulgar).<ref>\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0431\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435. \u041a\u044a\u0441\u043d\u043e \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0435 \u0438 \u0412\u044a\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0435, \u0442\u043e\u043c 2, \u0413\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0438 \u0411\u0430\u043a\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0432, TRUD Publishers, 2004, {{ISBN|954-528-467-6}}, \u0441\u0442\u0440. 23. (Bg.)</ref>\n\nDuring the late 18th century, the Enlightenment in Western Europe provided influence for the initiation of the [[National awakening of Bulgaria|National awakening of the Bulgarian people]]. The awakening process met opposition with the [[rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire]] in the early 19th century. According to the proponents of Bulgarian national awakening, Bulgarians were oppressed as an ethnic community not only by the Turks, but also by the [[Greeks]]. They considered the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Greek Patriarchal clergy]] to be the main oppressor. forced Bulgarians to educate their children in Greek schools and imposed Church services exclusively in Greek in order to [[Hellenize]] the Bulgarian population.\n\n===School and Church struggle===\nDuring the early nineteenth century, national elites used ''ethno-linguistic'' principles to differentiate between \"Bulgarian\" and \"Greek\" identity into the Rum millet. Bulgarians wanted to create their own schools in a common modern literary standard.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=1jSg3lxgSy8C&pg=PA134&dq=common+macedonian+bulgarian+language+bulgarian&hl=bg&sa=X&ei=9RJ8UdX9OfKL4gSByoGQDw&ved=0CDsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=common%20macedonian%20bulgarian%20language%20bulgarian&f=false Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Macedonia Historical Dictionaries of Europe], Dimitar Bechev, Scarecrow Press, 2009, {{ISBN|0-8108-6295-6}}, p. 134.</ref> In the Balkans, Bulgarian education stimulated nationalist sentiments in the middle of the 19th century. Most wealthy Bulgarian merchants, sent their children for a secular education, turning some of them into Bulgarian national activists. At that time secular Bulgarian schools were spreading throughout [[Moesia]], Thrace and Macedonia, aided by modern classroom methods. This expanding set of Bulgarian schools began to come into contact with Greek schools setting the stage for nationalist conflict.<ref>For more see: Julian Brooks, The Education Race for Macedonia, 1878\u20141903 in The Journal of Modern Hellenism, Vol 31 (2015) pp. 23\u201358.</ref> \n\nBy the middle of the century, Bulgarian activists shifted their attention from language to religion and started debate on the establishment of a separate Bulgarian church.<ref>From Rum Millet to Greek and Bulgarian Nations: Religious and National Debates in the Borderlands of the Ottoman Empire, 1870\u20131913,  [https://aha.confex.com/aha/2011/webprogram/Paper5169.html Theodora Dragostinova, Ohio State University, 2011, Columbus, OH.]</ref> As a consequence, until the 1870s, the focus of the [[Bulgarian National Revival]] switched to the struggle for a Bulgarian Church, independent from the Patriarchate of Constantinople. Cultural, administrative and even political independence from the Patriarchate could only be obtained through the establishment of a separate millet or ''[[nation]]''. The coordinated actions aimed at the recognition of a separate millet constitute the so-called \"Church Struggle\". The actions were carried out by Bulgarian national leaders and supported by the majority of the Slavic population in today Bulgaria, Eastern Serbia, North Macedonia and Northern Greece.\n\nBulgarians often relied on the Ottoman authorities as allies in their confrontations with the Patriarchists. The Sultan Firman of 1847 was the first official document  was issued, in which the name ''Bulgarian millet'' was mentioned.<ref>History of the Literary Cultures of East-Central Europe, Marcel Cornis-Pope, John Neubauer, John Benjamins Publishing, 2004, {{ISBN|90-272-3453-1}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5pAwqsSyTlsC&pg=PA403&dq=firman+of+sultan+bulgarian+millet&hl=bg&sa=X&ei=01KoUsSeIeT4ygOpuIDoDg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 403.]</ref> In 1849 the Sultan granted the Bulgarian millet the right to construct [[Bulgarian St. Stephen Church|its own church in Istanbul]],<ref>The Establishment of the Balkan National States, 1804\u20131920, Charles Jelavich, Barbara Jelavich, University of Washington Press, 1986, {{ISBN|0-295-80360-6}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LBYriPYyfUoC&pg=PA132&dq=firman+of+sultan+bulgarian+millet&hl=bg&sa=X&ei=01KoUsSeIeT4ygOpuIDoDg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 132.]</ref> The church subsequently hosted the Easter Sunday of 1860 when the autocephalous [[Bulgarian Exarchate]] was first de facto proclaimed.<ref>A Short History of Modern Bulgaria, R.

Scholars argue that the millet system was instrumental to transforming the \nBulgarian Exarchate into an entity that promoted ethnoreligious nationalism amongst Orthodox Bulgarians.<ref name='Bremer' />\n\nOn 11 May 1872 in the Bulgarian St. Stephen Church in Constantinople, which had been closed by the Ecumenical Patriarch's order, the Bulgarian hierarchs, celebrated a liturgy, whereafter the autocephaly of the Bulgarian Church was declared. The decision on the unilateral declaration of [[autocephaly]] by the Bulgarian Church was not accepted by the [[Patriarchate of Constantinople]]. In this way, the term ''[[phyletism]]'' was coined at the Holy pan-Orthodox Synod that met in [[Istanbul]] on 10 August. The Synod issued an official condemnation of  [[Ethnic religion|ecclesiastical nationalism]], and declared on 18 September the  [[Bulgarian schism|Bulgarian Exarchate schismatic]].\n\n===Independence of Bulgaria===\n\nHaving achieved religious independence, Bulgarian nationalists focused on gaining political independence as well.  \nTwo revolutionary movements started to develop in the beginning of the 1870s: the [[Internal Revolutionary Organisation]] and the [[Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee]]. Their armed struggle reached its peak with the [[April Uprising]] which broke out in 1876. It resulted in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u20131878, and led to the [[Liberation of Bulgaria|foundation of the third Bulgarian state]] after the [[Treaty of San Stefano]]. The treaty set up a Principality Bulgaria which territory included the wide area between the Danube and the Balkan mountain range, most of today Eastern Serbia, Northern Thrace, parts of Eastern Thrace and nearly all of Macedonia. At that time the clergy's shifts from the Orthodox to the Catholic Church and vice versa were symptomatic of the foreign powers' game that the clergy got involved after the 1878 [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Berlin Treaty]], that partitioned the stipulated territory of the new Principality. Thus, in the interplay between the Orthodox and the Uniat doctrine, Bulgaria supported the Orthodox Exarchate. [[Russia]] supported Bulgaria. The Greek [[Patriarchate of Constantinople]] supported the [[Greece|Greek]] national idea. France and the [[Austria-Hungary|Habsburg Empire]] supported the Uniats. The Ottoman Empire's attitude was depending on how it had to balance its own interests in the game with the [[Great Powers]].\n\n===Thrace and Macedonia===\nThe ideas of [[Bulgarian nationalism]] grew up in significance, following the [[Congress of Berlin]] which took back the regions of Macedonia and Southern Thrace, returning them under the control of the Ottoman Empire. Also an autonomous Ottoman province, called [[Eastern Rumelia]] was created in [[Northern Thrace]]. As a consequence, the Bulgarian nationalist movement proclaimed as its aim the inclusion of most of Macedonia and Thrace under Greater Bulgaria. Eastern Rumelia was annexed to Bulgaria in 1885 through bloodless revolution. During the early 1890s, two [[Bulgarophile|pro-Bulgarian]] revolutionary organizations active in Macedonia and Southern Thrace were founded: the [[Bulgarian Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Committees]] and the [[Supreme Macedonian-Adrianople Committee]]. The [[Macedonian Slavs]] then, were regarded and self-identified predominantly as [[Macedonian Bulgarians]].<ref>''During the 20th century, Slavo-Macedonian national feeling has shifted. At the beginning of the 20th century, Slavic patriots in Macedonia felt a strong attachment to Macedonia as a multi-ethnic homeland&nbsp;... Most of these Macedonian Slavs also saw themselves as Bulgarians. By the middle of the 20th. century, however Macedonian patriots began to see Macedonian and Bulgarian loyalties as mutually exclusive. Regional Macedonian nationalism had become ethnic Macedonian nationalism&nbsp;... This transformation shows that the content of collective loyalties can shift.''

That was followed by series of conflicts between Greeks and Bulgarians into both regions. The tension were result of the  different concepts of nationality. The Slavic villages became divided into followers of the Bulgarian national movement and so-called ''[[grecomans]].'' The [[Young Turk Revolution]] of 1908 restored the Ottoman Parliament, which had been suspended by the Sultan in 1878. After the Revolution armed factions laid down their arms and joined the legal struggle. The Bulgarians founded the [[Peoples' Federative Party (Bulgarian Section)]] and the [[Union of the Bulgarian Constitutional Clubs]] and participated in Ottoman elections. Soon, the [[Young Turks]] turned increasingly [[Ottomanism|Ottomanist]] and sought to suppress the national aspirations of the various minorities in Macedonia and Thrace.\n\n===Dissolution===\nThe effect of the [[Balkan Wars]] in 1912\u20131913 was the partition of [[Ottoman empire]] territories in Europe, which was followed by an anti-Bulgarian campaign in areas of Macedonia and Thrace, that came under [[Serbia]]n and [[Greece|Greek]] administration.
