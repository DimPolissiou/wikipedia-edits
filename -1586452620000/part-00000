{"title_page": "George Washington and slavery", "text_new": "[[File:GW-painting.jpg|thumb|right|''George Washington'' ([[John Trumbull]], 1780), with [[William Lee (valet)|William Lee]], Washington's enslaved personal servant|alt=painting]]\n{{Use mdy dates|date=September 2016}}\n\n'''George Washington''' was a [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Father of the United States]] and slaveowner who became uneasy with the institution of slavery but provided for the emancipation of his slaves only after his death. [[Slavery in the colonial United States|Slavery]] was ingrained in the economic and social fabric of [[Colony of Virginia|colonial Virginia]], and [[George Washington|Washington]] inherited his first ten slaves at the age of eleven on the death of his father in 1743. In adulthood his personal slaveholding increased through inheritance, purchase and natural increase. In 1759, he gained control of [[Dowry|dower]] slaves belonging to the Custis estate on his marriage to [[Martha Dandridge Custis]]. Washington's early attitudes to slavery reflected the prevailing Virginia [[Planter class|planter]] views of the day, and so he demonstrated no moral qualms about the institution. He became skeptical about the economic efficacy of slavery before the [[American Revolutionary War]], and expressed support in private for abolition by a gradual legislative process after the war. Washington remained dependent on slave labor, and by the time of his death in 1799 there were 317 slaves at his [[Mount Vernon]] estate, 124 owned by Washington and the remainder managed by him as his own property but belonging to other people.\n\nWashington was a demanding master. He provided his slaves with basic food, clothing and accommodation comparable to general practice at the time but not always adequate, and with medical care. In return, he expected them to work diligently from sunrise to sunset over the six-day working week that was standard at the time. Some three-quarters of the slaves labored in the fields, while the remainder worked at the main residence as domestic servants and artisans. They supplemented their diet by hunting, trapping, and growing vegetables in their free time, and bought extra rations, clothing and housewares with income from the sale of game and produce. They built their own community around marriage and family, though because Washington allocated slaves to farms according to the demands of the business without regard for their relationships, many husbands lived separately from their wives and children. Washington used both reward and punishment to encourage and discipline his slaves, but was constantly disappointed when they failed to meet his exacting standards. They resisted enslavement by various means, including theft to supplement food and clothing and as another source of income, by feigning illness, and by running away.\n\nWashington's first doubts about slavery were entirely economic, prompted by his transition from tobacco to grain crops in the 1760's which left him with a costly surplus of slaves. As commander-in-chief of the Continental Army in 1775, he initially refused to accept African-Americans, free or slave, into the ranks, but reversed this position due to the demands of war. The first indication of moral doubt appeared during efforts to sell some of his slaves in 1778, when Washington expressed his distaste for selling them at a public venue and his desire that slave families not be split up as a result of the sale. His public words and deeds at the end of the American Revolutionary War betrayed no antislavery sentiments. Politically, Washington was concerned that such a divisive issue as [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] should not threaten national unity, and he never spoke publicly about the institution. Privately, Washington considered plans in the mid 1790s to free all the slaves he controlled, but they could not be realized because of his failure to secure his own financial security and the refusal of his family to cooperate. His will provided for the emancipation of his own slaves, the only [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Father]] to do so. Because many of his slaves were married to Martha's dower slaves, whom he could not legally free, Washington stipulated that, with the exception of his valet William Lee who was freed immediately, his slaves be emancipated on the death of Martha. She freed them in 1801, a year before her own death, but her dower slaves were passed to her grandchildren and remained in bondage.\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|History of slavery in Virginia}}\n[[File:The Leading Facts of American History (1910) - The First Negro Slaves Brought to Virginia.png|thumb|First slaves arriving in Virginia|alt=Black and white illustration]]\nSlavery was introduced into the English [[colony of Virginia]] when the first Africans were transported to [[Old Point Comfort|Point Comfort]] in 1619. Those who accepted Christianity became \"Christian servants\" with time-limited servitude, or even freed, but this mechanism for ending bondage was gradually shut down. In 1667, the [[Virginia General Assembly|Virginia Assembly]] passed a law that barred [[baptism]] as a means of conferring freedom. Africans who had been baptised before arriving in Virginia could be granted the status of [[Indentured servitude|indentured servant]] until 1682, when another law declared them to be slaves. Whites and people of African descent in the lowest stratum of Virginian society shared common disadvantages and a common lifestyle, which included intermarriage until the Assembly made such unions punishable by banishment in 1691.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 41\u201343</ref>\n\nIn 1671, Virginia counted 6,000 white indentured servants among its 40,000 population but only 2,000 people of African descent, up to a third of whom in some counties were free. Towards the end of the 17th century, British policy shifted in favor of retaining cheap labor rather than shipping it to the colonies, and the supply of indentured servants in Virginia began to dry up; by 1715, annual immigration was in the hundreds, compared with 1,500\u20132,000 in the 1680s. As tobacco planters put more land under cultivation, they made up the shortfall in labor with increasing numbers of slaves. The institution was rooted in race with the [[Virginia Slave Codes of 1705]], and from around 1710 the growth in the slave population was fueled by natural increase. Between 1700 and 1750 the number of slaves in the colony increased from 13,000 to 105,000, nearly eighty percent of them born in Virginia.<ref>Wiencek 2003 43\u201346</ref> In Washington's lifetime, slavery was deeply ingrained in the economic and social fabric of Virginia, where some forty percent of the population and virtually all African Americans were enslaved.<ref>Henriques 2008 p. 146</ref>\n\nGeorge Washington was born February 22, 1732, the first child of his father [[Augustine Washington|Augustine]]'s second marriage. Augustine was a tobacco planter with some {{convert|10,000|acre|ha}} of land and 50 slaves. On his death in 1743, he left his {{convert|2,500|acre|ha|adj=on}} Little Hunting Creek to George's older half-brother [[Lawrence Washington (1718\u20131752)|Lawrence]], who renamed it [[Mount Vernon]]. Washington inherited the {{convert|260|acre|ha|adj=on}} [[Ferry Farm]] and ten slaves.<ref>Chernow 2010 pp. 22\u201328</ref> He leased Mount Vernon from Lawrence's widow two years after his brother's death in 1752 and inherited it in 1761.<ref>Chernow 2010 pp. 82, 137</ref> He was an aggressive land speculator, and by 1774 he had amassed some {{convert|32,000|acre|ha}} of land in the [[Ohio Country]] on Virginia's western frontier.

Horses and mules were bred in stables there, and tropical plants were grown in a greenhouse. Trades such as blacksmithing, carpentry, barrel making (coopering), food production and preservation, spinning, weaving and shoe making were carried out in other buildings at Mansion House Farm.

This was replaced in 1792 by brick-built accommodation wings either side of the greenhouse comprising four rooms in total, each of some {{convert|600|sqft|m2}}. The [[Mount Vernon Ladies' Association]] have concluded these rooms were communal areas furnished with bunks that allowed little privacy for the predominantly male occupants. Other slaves at Mansion House Farm lived over the outbuildings where they worked or in log cabins.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 162\u2013164, 166\u2013167</ref> Such cabins were the standard slave accommodation at the outlying farms, comparable to the accommodation occupied by the lower strata of free white society across the [[Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake area]] and by slaves on other Virginia plantations.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 162, 167, 169</ref> They provided a single room that ranged in size from 168 square feet (15.6 m2) to 246 square feet (22.9 m2) to house a family.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 168\u2013169</ref> The cabins were often poorly constructed, daubed with mud for draft- and water-proofing, with dirt floors. Some cabins were built as duplexes; some single-unit cabins were small enough to be moved on carts.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 168, 170</ref> There are few sources which shed light on living conditions in these cabins, but one visitor in 1798 wrote, \"husband and wife sleep on a mean pallet, the children on the ground; a very bad fireplace, some utensils for cooking, but in the middle of this poverty some cups and a teapot.\" Other sources suggest the interiors were smoky, dirty and dark, with only a shuttered opening for a window and the fireplace for illumination at night.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 170\u2013172</ref>\n\nWashington provided slaves with a blanket each fall at most, which they used for their own bedding and which they were required to use to gather leaves for livestock bedding.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 175\u2013176</ref> Slaves at the outlying farms were issued with a basic set of clothing each year, comparable to the clothing issued on other Virginia plantations. Slaves slept and worked in their clothes, leaving them to spend many months in garments that were worn, ripped and tattered.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 177\u2013178</ref> Domestic slaves at the main residence who came into regular contact with visitors were better clothed; butlers, waiters and body servants were dressed in a [[livery]] based on the three-piece suit of an 18th-century gentleman, and maids were provided with finer quality clothing than their counterparts in the fields.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 179\u2013181</ref>\n\nWashington desired his slaves to be fed adequately but no more.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 244\u2013245</ref> Each slave was provided with a basic daily food ration of {{convert|1|USqt|l|spell=in}} or more of [[cornmeal]], up to {{convert|8|oz|g|spell=in}} of herring and occasionally some meat, a fairly typical ration for slaves in Virginia that was adequate in terms of the calorie requirement for a young man engaged in moderately heavy agricultural labor but nutritionally deficient.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 221\u2013222, 245</ref> The basic ration was supplemented by slaves' own efforts hunting (for which some slaves were allowed guns) and trapping game. They grew their own vegetables in small garden plots they were permitted to maintain in their own time, on which they also reared poultry.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 229\u2013231</ref>\n\nWashington often tipped slaves on his visits to other estates, and it is likely that his own slaves were similarly rewarded by visitors to Mount Vernon. Slaves occasionally earned money through their normal work or for particular services rendered{{snd}}for example, Washington rewarded three of his own slaves with cash for good service in 1775, a slave received a fee for the care of a mare that was being bred in 1798 and the chef [[Hercules (chef)|Hercules]] profited well by selling slops from the presidential kitchen.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 193\u2013194</ref> Slaves also earned money from their own endeavors, by selling to Washington or at the market in [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] food they had caught or grown and small items they had made.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 197, 231</ref> They used the proceeds to purchase from Washington or the shops in Alexandria better clothing, housewares and extra provisions such as flour, pork, whiskey, tea, coffee and sugar.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 194, 195\u2013196, 232</ref>\n\n===Family and community===\n[[File:Slave Cabin interior 01 - Mount Vernon.jpg|thumb|Interior of the reconstructed slave cabin at Mount Vernon|alt=Photograph showing single bedding on a pallet on a dirt floor]]\nAlthough the law did not recognize slave marriages, Washington did, and by 1799 some two-thirds of the adult slaves at Mount Vernon were married.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 128</ref> To minimize time lost in getting to the workplace and thus increase productivity, slaves were accommodated at the farm on which they worked. Because of the unequal distribution of males and females across the five farms, slaves often found partners on different farms, and in their day to day lives husbands were routinely separated from their wives and children. Only thirty-six of the ninety-six married slaves at Mount Vernon in 1799 lived together, while thirty-eight had spouses who lived on separate farms and twenty-two had spouses who lived on other plantations.<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 122</ref><ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 132\u2013133</ref> The evidence suggests couples that were separated did not regularly visit during the week, and doing so prompted complaints from Washington that slaves were too exhausted to work after such \"night walking\", leaving Saturday nights/Sundays and holidays as the main time such families could spend together.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 134, 136, 202</ref> Despite the stress and anxiety caused by this indifference to family stability{{snd}}on one occasion an overseer wrote that the separation of families \"seems like death to them\"{{snd}}marriage was the foundation on which slaves established their own community, and longevity in these unions was not uncommon.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 127, 130\u2013131, 132</ref><ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 123</ref>\n\nLarge families that covered multiple generations, along with their attendant marriages, were part of a slave community-building process that transcended ownership. Washington's head carpenter Isaac, for example, lived with his wife Kitty, a dower-slave milkmaid, at Mansion House Farm. The couple had nine daughters ranging in age from six to twenty-seven in 1799, and the marriages of four of those daughters had extended the family to other farms within and outside the Mount Vernon estate and produced three grandchildren.<ref name=\"Thompson 2019 p. 135\">Thompson 2019 p. 135</ref><ref>Morgan 2005 p. 421</ref> Children were born into slavery, their ownership determined by the ownership of their mothers.<ref name=\"Thompson 2019 p. 309\">Thompson 2019 p. 309</ref> The value attached to the birth of a slave child, if it was noted at all, is indicated in the weekly report of one overseer, which stated, \"Increase 9 Lambs & 1 male child of Lynnas.\" New mothers received a new blanket and three to five weeks of light duties to recover. An infant remained with its mother at her place of work.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 151\u2013152</ref> Older children, the majority of whom lived in single-parent households in which the mother worked from dawn to dusk, performed small family chores but were otherwise left to play largely unsupervised until they reached an age when they could begin to be put to work for Washington, usually somewhere between eleven and fourteen years old.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 158\u2013160</ref> In 1799, nearly sixty percent of the slave population was under nineteen years old and nearly thirty-five percent under nine.<ref name=\"Thompson 2019 p. 135\"/>\n\nThere is evidence that slaves passed on their African cultural values through telling stories, among them the tales of [[Br'er Rabbit]] which, with their origins in Africa and stories of a powerless individual triumphing through wit and intelligence over powerful authority, would have resonated with the slaves.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 203</ref> African-born slaves brought with them some of the religious rituals of their ancestral home, and there is an undocumented tradition of voodoo being practiced at one of the Mount Vernon farms.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 211\u2013213</ref> Although the slave condition made it impossible to adhere to the [[Five Pillars of Islam]], some slave names betray a Muslim cultural origin.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 213\u2013214</ref> [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]] reached out to American-born slaves in Virginia, and some of the Mount Vernon slaves are known to have been christened before Washington acquired the estate. There is evidence in the historical record from 1797 that Mount Vernon slaves had contacts with [[Baptists]], [[Methodism|Methodists]] and [[Quakers]].<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 208\u2013209</ref> The three religions advocated abolition, raising hopes of freedom among the slaves, and the congregation of the Alexandria Baptist Church, founded in 1803, included slaves formerly owned by Washington.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 209, 210\u2013211</ref>\n\n===Mulattoes===\nIn 1799 there were some twenty [[mulatto]] (mixed race) slaves at Mount Vernon. The probability of paternal relationships between slaves and hired white workers is indicated by some surnames: Betty and Tom Davis, probably the children of Thomas Davis, a white weaver at Mount Vernon in the 1760s; George Young, likely the son of a man of the same name who was a clerk at Mount Vernon in 1774; and [[Oney Judge]] and her sister Delphy, the daughters of Andrew Judge, an indentured tailor at Mount Vernon in the 1770s and 1780s.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 136, 138\u2013139</ref> There is evidence to suggest that white overseers{{snd}}working in close proximity to slaves under the same demanding master and physically and socially isolated from their own peer group, a situation that drove some to drink{{snd}}indulged in sexual relations with the slaves they supervised.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 140\u2013141</ref> Some white visitors to Mount Vernon seemed to have expected slave women to provide sexual favors.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 141\u2013142</ref> The living arrangements left some slave females alone and vulnerable, and the Mount Vernon research historian Mary V. Thompson writes that relationships \"could have been the result of mutual attraction and affection, very real demonstrations of power and control, or even exercises in the manipulation of an authority figure.\"<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 136, 140</ref>{{efn|There is an oral tradition among the descendants of the freedman [[West Ford (slave)|West Ford]] that he was the son of Washington and Venus, a slave belonging to Washington's brother [[John Augustine Washington]]. A case made by the historian Henry Wiencek is, according to the historian Philip Morgan, \"so circumstantial as to be fanciful,\" and there is no evidence that Washington ever met Venus, let alone fathered a child by her.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 147\u2013151</ref><ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 419, 420 n26</ref>}}\n\n===Resistance===\n[[File:Oney Judge Runaway Ad.jpg|thumb|left|Advertisement placed in the ''Pennsylvania Gazette'' after Oney Judge absconded from the President's House in 1796|alt=Newspaper clipping]]\nThe frequent comments Washington made about \"rogueries\" and \"old tricks\" indicate the resistance displayed by the slaves against the system.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 261</ref> The most common act of resistance was theft, so common that Washington made allowances for it as part of normal wastage. Food was stolen both to supplement rations and to sell, and Washington believed the selling of tools was another source of income for slaves. Because cloth and clothing were commonly stolen, Washington required seamstresses to show the results of their work and the leftover scraps before issuing them with more material. Sheep were washed before shearing to prevent the theft of wool, and storage areas were kept locked and keys left with trusted individuals.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 269\u2013271</ref> In 1792, Washington ordered the culling of slaves' dogs he believed were being used in a spate of livestock theft and ruled that slaves who kept dogs without authorization were to be \"severely punished\" and their dogs hanged.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 201</ref>\n\nAnother means by which slaves resisted, one that was virtually impossible to prove, was feigning illness. Over the years Washington became increasingly skeptical about absenteeism due to sickness among his slaves and concerned about the diligence or ability of his overseers in recognizing genuine cases. Between 1792 and 1794, while Washington was away from Mount Vernon as President, the number of days lost to sickness increased tenfold compared to 1786, when he was resident at Mount Vernon and able to control the situation personally. In one case, Washington suspected a slave of frequently avoiding work over a period of decades through acts of deliberate self harm.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 261\u2013263, 264\u2013265</ref>\n\nSlaves asserted some independence and frustrated Washington by the pace and quality of their work.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 105, 265</ref> In 1760, Washington noted that four of his carpenters quadrupled their output of timber under his personal supervision.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 93\u201394</ref> Thirty-five years later, he described his carpenters as an \"idle...set of rascals\" who would take a month or more to complete at Mount Vernon work that was being done in two or three days in [[Philadelphia]]. The output of seamstresses dropped off when Martha was away, and spinners found they could slacken by playing the overseers off against her.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 266\u2013267</ref> Tools were regularly lost or damaged, thus stopping work, and Washington despaired of employing innovations that might improve efficiency because he believed the slaves were too clumsy to operate the new machinery involved.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 266, 268</ref>\n\nThe most emphatic act of resistance was to run away, and between 1760 and 1799 at least forty-seven slaves under Washington's control did so.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 275</ref> Seventeen of these, fourteen men and three women, escaped to a British warship that anchored in the [[Potomac River]] near Mount Vernon in 1781.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 278, 279</ref> In general, the best chance of success lay with second- or third-generation African-American slaves who had good English, possessed skills that would allow them to support themselves as free people and were in close enough contact with their masters to receive special privileges. Thus it was that Judge, an especially talented seamstress, and Hercules escaped in 1796 and 1797 respectively and eluded recapture.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 281, 284\u2013286</ref> Washington took seriously the recapture of fugitives, and in three cases an escaped slave was sold off in the West Indies after recapture, effectively a death sentence in the severe conditions slaves had to endure there.<ref name=\"Wiencek 2003 p. 132\">Wiencek 2003 p. 132</ref><ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 411\u2013412</ref><ref>Chernow 2010 p. 161</ref>\n\n===Control===\n{{Quote box\n|align=right\n|salign=right\n|width=25%\n|quote=Slavery was a system in which enslaved people lived in fear; fear of being sold, fear of being separated from their families or their children or their parents, fear of not being in control of their bodies or their lives, fear of never knowing freedom.

By 1766, he had transitioned his business from the labor-intensive planting of tobacco to the less demanding farming of grain crops. His slaves were employed on a greater variety of tasks that needed more skills than tobacco planting required of them; as well as the cultivation of grains and vegetables, they were employed in cattle herding, spinning, weaving and carpentry. The transition left Washington with a surplus of slaves and revealed to him the inefficiencies of the slave labor system.<ref name=Morgan2005p413>Morgan 2005 p. 413</ref><ref name=Twohig118>Twohig 2001 p. 118</ref>\n\nThere is little evidence that Washington seriously questioned the ethics of slavery before the Revolution.<ref name=Twohig118 /> In the 1760s he often participated in tavern lotteries, events in which defaulters' debts were settled by raffling off their assets to a high-spirited crowd.<ref>Chernow 2010 p. 162</ref> In 1769, Washington co-managed one such lottery in which fifty-five slaves were sold, among them six families and five females with children.

The volumes covered subjects that generally were of importance to him, such as agriculture, the Revolution, the [[Society of the Cincinnati]] and politics. The single pre-1788 pamphlet of the six in ''Tracts on Slavery'' was ''A Serious Address to the Rulers of America, on the Inconsistency of Their Conduct Respecting Slavery'', published in 1783. It was the first pamphlet in the volume, and Washington had written his signature on the cover, as he did with the first pamphlet in each of the thirty-six volumes. Of the eleven pamphlets on slavery that were, presumably, not considered to be worth binding, eight were published before 1788. One of them, published in 1785, was never read. The implication is that Washington became more interested in the subject in the early 1790s.<ref>Furstenberg 2011 pp. 251\u2013253, 260, 263\u2013264</ref>}} All six shared common themes that slaves first had to be educated about the obligations of liberty before they could be emancipated, a belief Washington is reported to have expressed himself in 1798, and that abolition should be realized by a gradual legislative process, an idea that began to appear in Washington's correspondence during the [[Confederation Period|Confederation period]].<ref>Furstenberg 2011 pp. 250\u2013253, 273\u2013275, 285</ref><ref name=\"Hirschfeld 1997 pp. 72\u201373\">Hirschfeld 1997 pp. 72\u201373</ref>\n\nWashington was not impressed by what Dorothy Twohig{{snd}}a former editor-in-chief of [[The Washington Papers]]{{snd}}described as the \"imperious demands\" and \"evangelical piety\" of Quaker efforts to advance abolition, and in 1786 he complained about their \"tamper[ing] with & seduc[ing]\" slaves who \"are happy & content to remain with their present masters.\"<ref>Twohig 2001 p. 129</ref><ref name=Morgan2005p419>Morgan 2005 p. 419</ref> Only the most radical of abolitionists called for immediate emancipation.

On returning to France, Lafayette purchased a plantation in the French colony of Cayenne, modern-day [[French Guiana]], and advised Washington of his progress by letter in 1786. Lafayette had taken concerns about the abrupt emancipation of slaves into account, paying and educating the slaves he settled on the plantation before freeing them. He became a leading figure in the French movement against the slave trade and a corresponding member of the British movement. Washington would not have known of Lafayette's antislavery activities in Cayenne or Europe from Lafayette himself; although the two continued to correspond for the rest of Washington's life, the subject of slavery virtually disappeared from their letters.

He presided over the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] in 1787, during which it became obvious just how explosive the issue was and how willing the antislavery faction was to accept the preservation of slavery to ensure national unity and the establishment of a strong federal government. The support of the southern states for the new constitution was secured by granting them concessions that protected slavery, including the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]] and the [[Fugitive Slave Clause]], plus clauses that guaranteed the transatlantic slave trade for at least twenty years and federal aid for the suppression of any slave rebellion.<ref>Morgan 2005 p. 422</ref><ref>Twohig 2001 pp. 124\u2013125</ref>\n\nWashington's preeminent position ensured that any actions he took with regard to his own slaves would become a statement in a national debate about slavery that threatened to divide the country. Wiencek suggests Washington considered making precisely such a statement on taking up the presidency in 1789. A passage in the notebook of Washington's biographer [[David Humphreys (soldier)|David Humphreys]]{{efn|Humphreys was a former aide to Washington and had begun an eighteen-month stay at Mount Vernon in 1787 to assist Washington with his correspondence and write his biography.<ref>Ellis 2004 p. 153</ref>}} dated to late 1788 or early 1789 recorded a statement that resembled the emancipation clause in Washington's will a decade later. Wiencek argues the passage was a draft for a public announcement Washington was considering in which he would declare the emancipation of some of his slaves. It marks, Wiencek believes, a moral epiphany in Washington's thinking, the moment he decided not only to emancipate his slaves but also to use the occasion to set the example Lafayette had urged in 1783.<ref name=\"Wiencek272\u2013275\">Wiencek 2003 pp. 272\u2013275</ref> Other historians dispute Wiencek's conclusion; Henriques and [[Joseph Ellis]] concur with Philip Morgan's opinion that Washington experienced no epiphanies in a \"long and hard-headed struggle\" in which there was no single turning point. Morgan argues that Humphreys' passage is the \"private expression of remorse\" from a man unable to extricate himself from the \"tangled web\" of \"mutual dependency\" on slavery, and that Washington believed public comment on such a divisive subject was best avoided for the sake of national unity.<ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 421\u2013423, 425</ref><ref>Ellis 2004 p. 311 n22</ref><ref name=Henriques159 />{{efn|Wiencek bases his argument on the fact that the passage was written in the past tense and appears in Humphreys' notebook amid drafts Humphreys had written for public statements Washington was to make about assuming the presidency.<ref name=\"Wiencek272\u2013275\" /> Philip Morgan points out that the passage was Humphreys' words in Washington's voice and appears just after a summary Humphreys had written of [[Thomas Clarkson]]'s 1788 ''An Essay on the Impolicy of the African Slave Trade''.<ref>Morgan 2005 p. 423 n31</ref> Kenneth Morgan characterizes the passage as \"a remark made in [Washington's] voice by David Humphreys.\"<ref name=Morgan2000p298 /> Fritz Hirschfeld writes that the passage was written by Humphreys during direct dictation or from memory of Washington's exact words, and believes it highly improbable that they were not Washington's own words.<ref>Hirschfeld 1997 p. 213 n5</ref>}}\n\n====As President====\n{{See also|Presidency of George Washington}}\n[[File:George Washington 1795.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|''President George Washington'' by Gilbert Stuart (1795) |alt=Portrait painting]]\nWashington took up the presidency at a time when revolutionary sentiment against slavery was giving way to a resurgence of proslavery interests.

This plan would have involved breaking up slave families, but it was designed with an end goal of raising enough finances to fund their eventual emancipation (a detail Washington kept secret) and prevent the Custis heirs from permanently splitting up families by sale.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 339\u2013342</ref><ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 303\u2013304</ref>{{efn|The dower slaves had already begun to be transferred to Martha's granddaughters as the Custis heirs married.

Peter had begun selling off slaves soon after his marriage, splitting up families and systematically separating girls as young as four years old from their parents. Wiencek suggests Martha's servant [[Oney Judge|Ona Judge]], who as a dower slave was destined to become Custis property, fled from Philadelphia in 1796 to avoid being sold.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 338\u2013342</ref>}} None of these schemes could be realized because of his failure to sell or rent land at the right prices, the refusal of the Custis heirs to agree to them and his own reluctance to separate families.<ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 423\u2013424</ref><ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 342</ref> Wiencek speculates that, because Washington gave such serious consideration to freeing his slaves knowing full well the political ramifications that would follow, one of his goals was to make a public statement that would sway opinion towards abolition.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 342\u2013343</ref> Philip Morgan argues that Washington freeing his slaves while President in 1794 or 1796 would have had no profound effect, and would have been greeted with public silence and private derision by white southerners.<ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 428\u2013429</ref>\n\nAs Washington subordinated his desire for emancipation to his efforts to secure financial independence, he took care to retain his slaves.<ref>Ellis 2004 pp. 258\u2013260</ref> In 1791, he arranged for those who served in his personal retinue while he was President in Philadelphia to be rotated out of the state before they became eligible for emancipation after six months residence per [[An Act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery|Pennsylvanian law]]. Not only would Washington have been deprived of their services if they were freed, most of the slaves he took with him to Philadelphia were dower slaves, which meant that he would have had to compensate the Custis estate for the loss. Because of his concerns for his public image and that the prospect of emancipation would generate discontent among the slaves before they became eligible for emancipation, he instructed that they be shuffled back to Mount Vernon \"under pretext that may deceive both them and the Public.\"<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 59\u201360</ref>\n\nWashington spared no expense in efforts to recover Hercules and Judge when they absconded. In Judge's case, Washington persisted for three years. He tried to persuade her to return when his agent eventually tracked her to New Hampshire, but refused to promise her freedom after his death; \"However well disposed I might be to a gradual emancipation,\" he said, \"or even to an entire emancipation of that description of People (if the latter was in itself practicable at this moment) it would neither be politic or just to reward unfaithfulness with a premature preference.\" Both Hercules and Judge eluded capture.<ref name=\"Ellis 2004 p. 260\"/> Washington's search for a new chef to replace Hercules in 1797 is the last known instance in which he considered buying a slave, despite his resolve \"never to become the Master of another Slave by purchase\", though in the end he chose to hire a white chef.<ref>Hirschfeld 1997 p. 15</ref>\n\n==Posthumous emancipation==\n[[File:GW-will.jpg|thumb|Washington's will published in the Connecticut Journal, February 20, 1800|alt=newspaper clipping]]\nIn July 1799, five months before his death, Washington wrote his will, in which he stipulated that his slaves should be freed. In the months that followed, he considered a plan that betrayed a continuing prioritization of profit above his concerns about the institution of slavery. The plan involved repossessing tenancies in [[Berkeley County, West Virginia|Berkeley]] and [[Frederick County, Virginia|Frederick]] Counties and transferring half of his Mount Vernon slaves to work them. It would, Washington hoped, \"yield more nett profit\" which might \"benefit myself and not render the [slaves'] condition worse\", despite the disruption such relocation would have had on the slave families. The plan died with Washington on December 14, 1799.<ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 404, 424</ref>{{efn|Philip Morgan speculates on the unlikely possibility that, had the plan proved profitable, Washington might have changed his will and retracted the manumission of his slaves.<ref>Morgan 2005 p. 425</ref>}}\n\nWashington's slaves were the subjects of the longest provisions in the twenty-nine-page will, taking three pages in which his instructions were more forceful than in the rest of the document. His valet, William Lee, was freed immediately and his remaining 123 slaves were to be emancipated on the death of Martha.<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 5</ref><ref name=Morgan2005p404 /> The deferral was intended to postpone the pain of separation that would occur when his slaves were freed but their spouses among the dower slaves remained in bondage, a situation which affected twenty couples and their children. It is possible Washington hoped Martha and her heirs who would inherit the dower slaves would solve this problem by following his example and emancipating them.<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 354</ref><ref>Hirschfeld 1997 p. 216</ref><ref name=\"Thompson 2019 p. 309\"/> Those too old or infirm to work were to be supported by his estate, as mandated by state law. Washington went beyond the legal requirement to support and maintain younger slaves until adulthood, stipulating that those children whose education could not be undertaken by parents were to be taught reading, writing and a useful trade by their masters and then be freed at the age of twenty-five.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 294</ref> Washington was particularly pointed in forbidding the sale or transportation of any of his slaves out of Virginia before their emancipation.<ref name=Morgan2005p404 /> Including the Dandridge slaves, who were emancipated under similar terms, more than 160 slaves were freed.<ref name=\"Morgan2005pp404\u2013405\" /><ref name=gwpapers /> Although he was not alone among Virginian slaveowners in freeing their slaves, he was the only Founding Father to do so.<ref>Morgan 2005 p. 427</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Slave Memorial - Mt.

By 1812, Free Town in [[Truro Parish, Virginia|Truro Parish]], the earliest known free African-American settlement in Fairfax County, contained seven households of former Washington slaves. By the mid 1800s, a son of Washington's carpenter Davy Jones and two grandsons of his [[postilion]] Joe Richardson had each bought land in Virginia. Francis Lee, younger brother of William, was well known and respected enough to have his obituary printed in the ''Alexandria Gazette'' on his death at Mount Vernon in 1821. Sambo Anderson{{snd}}who hunted game, as he had while Washington's slave, and prospered for a while by selling it to the most respectable families in Alexandria{{snd}}was similarly noted by the ''Gazette'' when he died near Mount Vernon in 1845.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 317\u2013319</ref> Research published in 2019 has concluded that Hercules worked as a cook in New York, where he died on May 15, 1812.<ref>Ganeshram 2019</ref>\n\nA decade after Washington's death, the Pennsylvanian jurist [[Richard Peters (Continental Congress)|Richard Peters]] wrote that Washington's servants \"were devoted to him; and especially those more immediately about his person.

Washington \"disdained to hold his fellow-creatures in abject domestic servitude,\" wrote the Massachusetts Federalist [[Timothy Bigelow (lawyer)|Timothy Bigelow]] before calling on \"fellow-citizens in the South\" to emulate Washington's example. In this narrative, Washington was a proto-abolitionist who, having added the freedom of his slaves to the freedom from British slavery he had won for the nation, would be mobilized to serve the antislavery cause.<ref>Furstenberg 2006 pp. 84\u201386</ref>\n\nAn alternative narrative more in line with proslavery sentiments embraced rather than excised Washington's ownership of slaves. Washington was cast as a paternal figure, the benevolent father not only of his country but also of a family of slaves bound to him by affection rather than coercion.<ref>Furstenberg 2006 pp. 92\u201394</ref> In this narrative, slaves idolized Washington and wept at his deathbed, and in an 1807 biography, [[Aaron Bancroft]] wrote, \"In domestick{{sic}} and private life, he blended the authority of the master with the care and kindness of the guardian and friend.\"<ref>Furstenberg 2006 pp. 94, 96\u201397</ref> The competing narratives allowed both [[Union (American Civil War)|North]] and [[Confederate States of America|South]] to claim Washington as the father of their countries during the [[American Civil War]] that ended slavery more than half a century after his death.<ref>Furstenberg 2006 pp. 100\u2013101</ref>\n\n===Memorial===\nIn 1929, a plaque was embedded in the ground at Mount Vernon less than {{convert|50|yd|m|round=5}} from the crypt housing the remains of Washington and Martha, marking a plot neglected by both groundsmen and tourist guides where slaves had been buried in unmarked graves.

[[Slavery in the colonial United States|Slavery]] was ingrained in the economic and social fabric of [[Colony of Virginia|colonial Virginia]], and [[George Washington|Washington]] inherited his first ten slaves at the age of eleven on the death of his father in 1743. In adulthood his personal slaveholding increased through inheritance, purchase and natural increase. In 1759, he gained control of [[Dowry|dower]] slaves belonging to the Custis estate on his marriage to [[Martha Dandridge Custis]]. Washington's early attitudes to slavery reflected the prevailing Virginia [[Planter class|planter]] views of the day, and so he demonstrated no moral qualms about the institution. He became skeptical about the economic efficacy of slavery before the [[American Revolutionary War]], and expressed support in private for abolition by a gradual legislative process after the war. Washington remained dependent on slave labor, and by the time of his death in 1799 there were 317 slaves at his [[Mount Vernon]] estate, 124 owned by Washington and the remainder managed by him as his own property but belonging to other people.\n\nWashington was a demanding master. He provided his slaves with basic food, clothing and accommodation comparable to general practice at the time but not always adequate, and with medical care. In return, he expected them to work diligently from sunrise to sunset over the six-day working week that was standard at the time. Some three-quarters of the slaves labored in the fields, while the remainder worked at the main residence as domestic servants and artisans. They supplemented their diet by hunting, trapping, and growing vegetables in their free time, and bought extra rations, clothing and housewares with income from the sale of game and produce. They built their own community around marriage and family, though because Washington allocated slaves to farms according to the demands of the business without regard for their relationships, many husbands lived separately from their wives and children. Washington used both reward and punishment to encourage and discipline his slaves, but was constantly disappointed when they failed to meet his exacting standards. They resisted enslavement by various means, including theft to supplement food and clothing and as another source of income, by feigning illness, and by running away.\n\nWashington's first doubts about slavery were entirely economic, prompted by his transition from tobacco to grain crops in the 1760's which left him with a costly surplus of slaves. As commander-in-chief of the Continental Army in 1775, he initially refused to accept African-Americans, free or slave, into the ranks, but reversed this position due to the demands of war. The first indication of moral doubt appeared during efforts to sell some of his slaves in 1778, when Washington expressed his distaste for selling them at a public venue and his desire that slave families not be split up as a result of the sale. His public words and deeds at the end of the American Revolutionary War betrayed no antislavery sentiments. Politically, Washington was concerned that such a divisive issue as [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] should not threaten national unity, and he never spoke publicly about the institution. Privately, Washington considered plans in the mid 1790s to free all the slaves he controlled, but they could not be realized because of his failure to secure his own financial security and the refusal of his family to cooperate. His will provided for the emancipation of his own slaves, the only [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Father]] to do so. Because many of his slaves were married to Martha's dower slaves, whom he could not legally free, Washington stipulated that, with the exception of his valet William Lee who was freed immediately, his slaves be emancipated on the death of Martha. She freed them in 1801, a year before her own death, but her dower slaves were passed to her grandchildren and remained in bondage.\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|History of slavery in Virginia}}\n[[File:The Leading Facts of American History (1910) - The First Negro Slaves Brought to Virginia.png|thumb|First slaves arriving in Virginia|alt=Black and white illustration]]\nSlavery was introduced into the English [[colony of Virginia]] when the first Africans were transported to [[Old Point Comfort|Point Comfort]] in 1619. Those who accepted Christianity became \"Christian servants\" with time-limited servitude, or even freed, but this mechanism for ending bondage was gradually shut down. In 1667, the [[Virginia General Assembly|Virginia Assembly]] passed a law that barred [[baptism]] as a means of conferring freedom. Africans who had been baptised before arriving in Virginia could be granted the status of [[Indentured servitude|indentured servant]] until 1682, when another law declared them to be slaves. Whites and people of African descent in the lowest stratum of Virginian society shared common disadvantages and a common lifestyle, which included intermarriage until the Assembly made such unions punishable by banishment in 1691.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 41\u201343</ref>\n\nIn 1671, Virginia counted 6,000 white indentured servants among its 40,000 population but only 2,000 people of African descent, up to a third of whom in some counties were free. Towards the end of the 17th century, British policy shifted in favor of retaining cheap labor rather than shipping it to the colonies, and the supply of indentured servants in Virginia began to dry up; by 1715, annual immigration was in the hundreds, compared with 1,500\u20132,000 in the 1680s. As tobacco planters put more land under cultivation, they made up the shortfall in labor with increasing numbers of slaves. The institution was rooted in race with the [[Virginia Slave Codes of 1705]], and from around 1710 the growth in the slave population was fueled by natural increase. Between 1700 and 1750 the number of slaves in the colony increased from 13,000 to 105,000, nearly eighty percent of them born in Virginia.<ref>Wiencek 2003 43\u201346</ref> In Washington's lifetime, slavery was deeply ingrained in the economic and social fabric of Virginia, where some forty percent of the population and virtually all African Americans were enslaved.<ref>Henriques 2008 p. 146</ref>\n\nGeorge Washington was born February 22, 1732, the first child of his father [[Augustine Washington|Augustine]]'s second marriage. Augustine was a tobacco planter with some {{convert|10,000|acre|ha}} of land and 50 slaves. On his death in 1743, he left his {{convert|2,500|acre|ha|adj=on}} Little Hunting Creek to George's older half-brother [[Lawrence Washington (1718\u20131752)|Lawrence]], who renamed it [[Mount Vernon]]. Washington inherited the {{convert|260|acre|ha|adj=on}} [[Ferry Farm]] and ten slaves.<ref>Chernow 2010 pp. 22\u201328</ref> He leased Mount Vernon from Lawrence's widow two years after his brother's death in 1752 and inherited it in 1761.<ref>Chernow 2010 pp. 82, 137</ref> He was an aggressive land speculator, and by 1774 he had amassed some {{convert|32,000|acre|ha}} of land in the [[Ohio Country]] on Virginia's western frontier.

Horses and mules were bred in stables there, and tropical plants were grown in a greenhouse. Trades such as blacksmithing, carpentry, barrel making (coopering), food production and preservation, spinning, weaving and shoe making were carried out in other buildings at Mansion House Farm. Some crops were grown at this farm, but the main agricultural business was conducted at the four outlying farms located in a radius of between {{convert|1+1/2|mi|km|spell=in}} and {{convert|3|mi|km|spell=in}} from the mansion: Dogue Run Farm, Muddy Hole Farm, Union Farm (formed from the earlier Ferry Farm and French's Farm) and River Farm.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 4</ref> A farm manager responsible for the running of the estate reported directly to Washington, while an overseer was employed at each of the farms.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 78\u201379</ref>}}\n\n[[File:A Map of Washington's Farms at Mt.

They were kept busy year round, their tasks varying with the season.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 117\u2013118</ref> The remainder worked as domestic servants in the main residence or as artisans, such as carpenters, [[joiner]]s, [[Cooper (profession)|coopers]], [[Hand spinning|spinners]] and seamstresses.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 109\u2013111</ref> Between 1766 and 1799, seven dower slaves worked at one time or another as overseers.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 86, 343\u2013344</ref> Slaves were expected to work from sunrise to sunset over a six-day work week that was standard on Virginia plantations. With two hours off for meals, their workdays would range between seven and a half hours to thirteen hours, depending on season. They were given three or four days off at Christmas and a day each at Easter and [[Whitsunday]].<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 106\u2013107, 122\u2013123</ref> Domestic slaves started early, worked into the evenings and did not necessarily have Sundays and holidays free.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 110, 124, 134</ref> On special occasions when slaves were required to put in extra effort, such as working through a holiday or bringing in the harvest, they were paid or compensated with extra time off.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 123\u2013124</ref>\n\nThere were elements of patriarchy and paternalism in Washington's attitudes to his workforce; he thought of his workers as part of an extended family in which he occupied the position of a father figure, with mutual obligations between master and servant.<ref>Morgan 2000 p. 282</ref><ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 45\u201348</ref> He instructed his overseers to treat slaves \"with humanity and tenderness\" when sick.<ref name=Morgan2005-410 /> Slaves who were less able, through injury, disability or age, were given light duties, while those too sick to work were generally, though not always, excused work while they recovered.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 120, 125</ref> Washington provided them with good, sometimes costly medical care{{snd}}when a slave named Cupid fell ill with [[pleurisy]], Washington had him taken to the main house where he could be better cared for and personally checked on him throughout the day.<ref>Twohig 2003 p. 117</ref><ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 100</ref> The humanitarian concern for the welfare of his slaves was mixed with an economic consideration for the lost productivity arising from sickness and death among the labor force.<ref name=\"Twohig 2001 p. 116\">Twohig 2001 p. 116</ref><ref>Ellis 2004 p. 46</ref> Although Washington insisted on an emotional distance between master and slave, there are examples of genuine affection, such as was the case with his valet [[William Lee (valet)|William Lee]], and evidence that slaves were able to approach him with their concerns and grievances.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 51\u201353, 97</ref>\n\n===Living conditions===\n[[File:Slave cabin at pioneer farm - Mount Vernon.jpg|thumb|left|Modern reconstruction of a slave cabin at Mount Vernon|alt=Photograph]]\nAt Mansion House Farm, most slaves were housed in a two-story [[Framing (construction)|frame building]] known as the \"Quarters for Families\". This was replaced in 1792 by brick-built accommodation wings either side of the greenhouse comprising four rooms in total, each of some {{convert|600|sqft|m2}}. The [[Mount Vernon Ladies' Association]] have concluded these rooms were communal areas furnished with bunks that allowed little privacy for the predominantly male occupants. Other slaves at Mansion House Farm lived over the outbuildings where they worked or in log cabins.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 162\u2013164, 166\u2013167</ref> Such cabins were the standard slave accommodation at the outlying farms, comparable to the accommodation occupied by the lower strata of free white society across the [[Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake area]] and by slaves on other Virginia plantations.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 162, 167, 169</ref> They provided a single room that ranged in size from 168 square feet (15.6 m2) to 246 square feet (22.9 m2) to house a family.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 168\u2013169</ref> The cabins were often poorly constructed, daubed with mud for draft- and water-proofing, with dirt floors. Some cabins were built as duplexes; some single-unit cabins were small enough to be moved on carts.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 168, 170</ref> There are few sources which shed light on living conditions in these cabins, but one visitor in 1798 wrote, \"husband and wife sleep on a mean pallet, the children on the ground; a very bad fireplace, some utensils for cooking, but in the middle of this poverty some cups and a teapot.\" Other sources suggest the interiors were smoky, dirty and dark, with only a shuttered opening for a window and the fireplace for illumination at night.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 170\u2013172</ref>\n\nWashington provided slaves with a blanket each fall at most, which they used for their own bedding and which they were required to use to gather leaves for livestock bedding.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 175\u2013176</ref> Slaves at the outlying farms were issued with a basic set of clothing each year, comparable to the clothing issued on other Virginia plantations. Slaves slept and worked in their clothes, leaving them to spend many months in garments that were worn, ripped and tattered.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 177\u2013178</ref> Domestic slaves at the main residence who came into regular contact with visitors were better clothed; butlers, waiters and body servants were dressed in a [[livery]] based on the three-piece suit of an 18th-century gentleman, and maids were provided with finer quality clothing than their counterparts in the fields.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 179\u2013181</ref>\n\nWashington desired his slaves to be fed adequately but no more.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 244\u2013245</ref> Each slave was provided with a basic daily food ration of {{convert|1|USqt|l|spell=in}} or more of [[cornmeal]], up to {{convert|8|oz|g|spell=in}} of herring and occasionally some meat, a fairly typical ration for slaves in Virginia that was adequate in terms of the calorie requirement for a young man engaged in moderately heavy agricultural labor but nutritionally deficient.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 221\u2013222, 245</ref> The basic ration was supplemented by slaves' own efforts hunting (for which some slaves were allowed guns) and trapping game. They grew their own vegetables in small garden plots they were permitted to maintain in their own time, on which they also reared poultry.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 229\u2013231</ref>\n\nWashington often tipped slaves on his visits to other estates, and it is likely that his own slaves were similarly rewarded by visitors to Mount Vernon. Slaves occasionally earned money through their normal work or for particular services rendered{{snd}}for example, Washington rewarded three of his own slaves with cash for good service in 1775, a slave received a fee for the care of a mare that was being bred in 1798 and the chef [[Hercules (chef)|Hercules]] profited well by selling slops from the presidential kitchen.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 193\u2013194</ref> Slaves also earned money from their own endeavors, by selling to Washington or at the market in [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] food they had caught or grown and small items they had made.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 197, 231</ref> They used the proceeds to purchase from Washington or the shops in Alexandria better clothing, housewares and extra provisions such as flour, pork, whiskey, tea, coffee and sugar.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 194, 195\u2013196, 232</ref>\n\n===Family and community===\n[[File:Slave Cabin interior 01 - Mount Vernon.jpg|thumb|Interior of the reconstructed slave cabin at Mount Vernon|alt=Photograph showing single bedding on a pallet on a dirt floor]]\nAlthough the law did not recognize slave marriages, Washington did, and by 1799 some two-thirds of the adult slaves at Mount Vernon were married.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 128</ref> To minimize time lost in getting to the workplace and thus increase productivity, slaves were accommodated at the farm on which they worked. Because of the unequal distribution of males and females across the five farms, slaves often found partners on different farms, and in their day to day lives husbands were routinely separated from their wives and children. Only thirty-six of the ninety-six married slaves at Mount Vernon in 1799 lived together, while thirty-eight had spouses who lived on separate farms and twenty-two had spouses who lived on other plantations.<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 122</ref><ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 132\u2013133</ref> The evidence suggests couples that were separated did not regularly visit during the week, and doing so prompted complaints from Washington that slaves were too exhausted to work after such \"night walking\", leaving Saturday nights/Sundays and holidays as the main time such families could spend together.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 134, 136, 202</ref> Despite the stress and anxiety caused by this indifference to family stability{{snd}}on one occasion an overseer wrote that the separation of families \"seems like death to them\"{{snd}}marriage was the foundation on which slaves established their own community, and longevity in these unions was not uncommon.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 127, 130\u2013131, 132</ref><ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 123</ref>\n\nLarge families that covered multiple generations, along with their attendant marriages, were part of a slave community-building process that transcended ownership. Washington's head carpenter Isaac, for example, lived with his wife Kitty, a dower-slave milkmaid, at Mansion House Farm. The couple had nine daughters ranging in age from six to twenty-seven in 1799, and the marriages of four of those daughters had extended the family to other farms within and outside the Mount Vernon estate and produced three grandchildren.<ref name=\"Thompson 2019 p. 135\">Thompson 2019 p. 135</ref><ref>Morgan 2005 p. 421</ref> Children were born into slavery, their ownership determined by the ownership of their mothers.<ref name=\"Thompson 2019 p. 309\">Thompson 2019 p. 309</ref> The value attached to the birth of a slave child, if it was noted at all, is indicated in the weekly report of one overseer, which stated, \"Increase 9 Lambs & 1 male child of Lynnas.\" New mothers received a new blanket and three to five weeks of light duties to recover. An infant remained with its mother at her place of work.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 151\u2013152</ref> Older children, the majority of whom lived in single-parent households in which the mother worked from dawn to dusk, performed small family chores but were otherwise left to play largely unsupervised until they reached an age when they could begin to be put to work for Washington, usually somewhere between eleven and fourteen years old.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 158\u2013160</ref> In 1799, nearly sixty percent of the slave population was under nineteen years old and nearly thirty-five percent under nine.<ref name=\"Thompson 2019 p. 135\"/>\n\nThere is evidence that slaves passed on their African cultural values through telling stories, among them the tales of [[Br'er Rabbit]] which, with their origins in Africa and stories of a powerless individual triumphing through wit and intelligence over powerful authority, would have resonated with the slaves.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 203</ref> African-born slaves brought with them some of the religious rituals of their ancestral home, and there is an undocumented tradition of voodoo being practiced at one of the Mount Vernon farms.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 211\u2013213</ref> Although the slave condition made it impossible to adhere to the [[Five Pillars of Islam]], some slave names betray a Muslim cultural origin.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 213\u2013214</ref> [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]] reached out to American-born slaves in Virginia, and some of the Mount Vernon slaves are known to have been christened before Washington acquired the estate. There is evidence in the historical record from 1797 that Mount Vernon slaves had contacts with [[Baptists]], [[Methodism|Methodists]] and [[Quakers]].<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 208\u2013209</ref> The three religions advocated abolition, raising hopes of freedom among the slaves, and the congregation of the Alexandria Baptist Church, founded in 1803, included slaves formerly owned by Washington.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 209, 210\u2013211</ref>\n\n===Mulattoes===\nIn 1799 there were some twenty [[mulatto]] (mixed race) slaves at Mount Vernon. The probability of paternal relationships between slaves and hired white workers is indicated by some surnames: Betty and Tom Davis, probably the children of Thomas Davis, a white weaver at Mount Vernon in the 1760s; George Young, likely the son of a man of the same name who was a clerk at Mount Vernon in 1774; and [[Oney Judge]] and her sister Delphy, the daughters of Andrew Judge, an indentured tailor at Mount Vernon in the 1770s and 1780s.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 136, 138\u2013139</ref> There is evidence to suggest that white overseers{{snd}}working in close proximity to slaves under the same demanding master and physically and socially isolated from their own peer group, a situation that drove some to drink{{snd}}indulged in sexual relations with the slaves they supervised.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 140\u2013141</ref> Some white visitors to Mount Vernon seemed to have expected slave women to provide sexual favors.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 141\u2013142</ref> The living arrangements left some slave females alone and vulnerable, and the Mount Vernon research historian Mary V. Thompson writes that relationships \"could have been the result of mutual attraction and affection, very real demonstrations of power and control, or even exercises in the manipulation of an authority figure.\"<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 136, 140</ref>{{efn|There is an oral tradition among the descendants of the freedman [[West Ford (slave)|West Ford]] that he was the son of Washington and Venus, a slave belonging to Washington's brother [[John Augustine Washington]]. A case made by the historian Henry Wiencek is, according to the historian Philip Morgan, \"so circumstantial as to be fanciful,\" and there is no evidence that Washington ever met Venus, let alone fathered a child by her.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 147\u2013151</ref><ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 419, 420 n26</ref>}}\n\n===Resistance===\n[[File:Oney Judge Runaway Ad.jpg|thumb|left|Advertisement placed in the ''Pennsylvania Gazette'' after Oney Judge absconded from the President's House in 1796|alt=Newspaper clipping]]\nThe frequent comments Washington made about \"rogueries\" and \"old tricks\" indicate the resistance displayed by the slaves against the system.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 261</ref> The most common act of resistance was theft, so common that Washington made allowances for it as part of normal wastage. Food was stolen both to supplement rations and to sell, and Washington believed the selling of tools was another source of income for slaves. Because cloth and clothing were commonly stolen, Washington required seamstresses to show the results of their work and the leftover scraps before issuing them with more material. Sheep were washed before shearing to prevent the theft of wool, and storage areas were kept locked and keys left with trusted individuals.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 269\u2013271</ref> In 1792, Washington ordered the culling of slaves' dogs he believed were being used in a spate of livestock theft and ruled that slaves who kept dogs without authorization were to be \"severely punished\" and their dogs hanged.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 201</ref>\n\nAnother means by which slaves resisted, one that was virtually impossible to prove, was feigning illness. Over the years Washington became increasingly skeptical about absenteeism due to sickness among his slaves and concerned about the diligence or ability of his overseers in recognizing genuine cases. Between 1792 and 1794, while Washington was away from Mount Vernon as President, the number of days lost to sickness increased tenfold compared to 1786, when he was resident at Mount Vernon and able to control the situation personally. In one case, Washington suspected a slave of frequently avoiding work over a period of decades through acts of deliberate self harm.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 261\u2013263, 264\u2013265</ref>\n\nSlaves asserted some independence and frustrated Washington by the pace and quality of their work.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 105, 265</ref> In 1760, Washington noted that four of his carpenters quadrupled their output of timber under his personal supervision.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 93\u201394</ref> Thirty-five years later, he described his carpenters as an \"idle...set of rascals\" who would take a month or more to complete at Mount Vernon work that was being done in two or three days in [[Philadelphia]]. The output of seamstresses dropped off when Martha was away, and spinners found they could slacken by playing the overseers off against her.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 266\u2013267</ref> Tools were regularly lost or damaged, thus stopping work, and Washington despaired of employing innovations that might improve efficiency because he believed the slaves were too clumsy to operate the new machinery involved.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 266, 268</ref>\n\nThe most emphatic act of resistance was to run away, and between 1760 and 1799 at least forty-seven slaves under Washington's control did so.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 275</ref> Seventeen of these, fourteen men and three women, escaped to a British warship that anchored in the [[Potomac River]] near Mount Vernon in 1781.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 278, 279</ref> In general, the best chance of success lay with second- or third-generation African-American slaves who had good English, possessed skills that would allow them to support themselves as free people and were in close enough contact with their masters to receive special privileges. Thus it was that Judge, an especially talented seamstress, and Hercules escaped in 1796 and 1797 respectively and eluded recapture.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 281, 284\u2013286</ref> Washington took seriously the recapture of fugitives, and in three cases an escaped slave was sold off in the West Indies after recapture, effectively a death sentence in the severe conditions slaves had to endure there.<ref name=\"Wiencek 2003 p. 132\">Wiencek 2003 p. 132</ref><ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 411\u2013412</ref><ref>Chernow 2010 p. 161</ref>\n\n===Control===\n{{Quote box\n|align=right\n|salign=right\n|width=25%\n|quote=Slavery was a system in which enslaved people lived in fear; fear of being sold, fear of being separated from their families or their children or their parents, fear of not being in control of their bodies or their lives, fear of never knowing freedom.

By 1766, he had transitioned his business from the labor-intensive planting of tobacco to the less demanding farming of grain crops. His slaves were employed on a greater variety of tasks that needed more skills than tobacco planting required of them; as well as the cultivation of grains and vegetables, they were employed in cattle herding, spinning, weaving and carpentry. The transition left Washington with a surplus of slaves and revealed to him the inefficiencies of the slave labor system.<ref name=Morgan2005p413>Morgan 2005 p. 413</ref><ref name=Twohig118>Twohig 2001 p. 118</ref>\n\nThere is little evidence that Washington seriously questioned the ethics of slavery before the Revolution.<ref name=Twohig118 /> In the 1760s he often participated in tavern lotteries, events in which defaulters' debts were settled by raffling off their assets to a high-spirited crowd.<ref>Chernow 2010 p. 162</ref> In 1769, Washington co-managed one such lottery in which fifty-five slaves were sold, among them six families and five females with children. The more valuable married males were raffled together with their wives and children; less valuable slaves were separated from their families into different lots. Robin and Bella, for example, were raffled together as husband and wife while their children, twelve-year-old Sukey and seven-year-old Betty, were listed in a separate lot. Only chance dictated whether the family would remain together, and with 1,840 tickets on sale the odds were not good.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 178\u2013180</ref>\n\nThe historian [[Henry Wiencek]] concludes that the repugnance Washington felt at this cruelty in which he had participated prompted his decision not to break up slave families by sale or purchase, and marks the beginning of a transformation in Washington's thinking about the morality of slavery.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 135, 188</ref> Wiencek writes that in 1775 Washington took more slaves than he needed rather than break up the family of a slave he had agreed to accept in payment of a debt.<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 188</ref> The historians [[Philip D.

Morgan writes that in 1772, Washington was \"all business\" and \"might have been buying livestock\" in purchasing more slaves who were to be, in Washington's words, \"strait Limb'd, & in every respect strong & likely, with good Teeth & good Countenance.\" Morgan gives a different account of the 1775 purchase, writing that Washington resold the slave because of the slave's resistance to being separated from family and that the decision to do so was \"no more than the conventional piety of large Virginia planters who usually said they did not want to break up slave families{{snd}}and often did it anyway.\"<ref name=Morgan2005p412>Morgan 2005 p. 412</ref><ref name=Henriques159>Henriques 2008 p. 159</ref>\n\n===American Revolution===\n[[File:List of George Washington's taxable property in Truro Parish Virginia including slaves 1788.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Washington's taxable property in April 1788: 121 slaves, 98 horses, 4 mules and a chariot|alt=Original document]]\nFrom the late 1760s, Washington became increasingly radicalized against the North American colonies' subservient status within the [[British Empire]].<ref>Ferling 2009 p. 69</ref> In 1774 he was a key participant in the adoption of the [[Fairfax Resolves]] which, alongside the assertion of colonial rights, condemned the [[Atlantic slave trade|transatlantic slave trade]] on moral grounds.<ref>Ferling 2009 p. 75</ref><ref name=Twohig118 /> He began to express the growing rift with [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] in terms of slavery, stating in the summer of 1774 that the British authorities were \"endeavouring by every piece of Art & despotism to fix the Shackles of Slavry{{sic}}\" upon the colonies. Two years later, on taking command of the [[Continental Army]] at Cambridge at the start of the [[American Revolutionary War]], he wrote in orders to his troops that \"it is a noble Cause we are engaged in, it is the Cause of virtue and mankind...freedom or Slavery must be the result of our conduct.\"<ref>Thompson 2019 p.64</ref> The hypocrisy inherent in slave owners characterizing a war of independence as a struggle for their own freedom from slavery was not lost on the British writer [[Samuel Johnson]], who asked, \"How is it that we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of Negroes?\"<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 191</ref>\n\nWashington shared the common southern concern about arming African-Americans or slaves and initially refused to accept either into the ranks of the Continental Army. He reversed his position on the recruitment of free African-Americans when the royal governor of Virginia, [[John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore|Lord Dunmore]], issued a [[Dunmore's Proclamation|proclamation]] in November 1775 offering freedom to rebel-owned slaves who enlisted in the British forces.

He sought to liberate himself from an economically unviable system, not to liberate his slaves. They were still a property from which he expected to profit.

On returning to France, Lafayette purchased a plantation in the French colony of Cayenne, modern-day [[French Guiana]], and advised Washington of his progress by letter in 1786. Lafayette had taken concerns about the abrupt emancipation of slaves into account, paying and educating the slaves he settled on the plantation before freeing them. He became a leading figure in the French movement against the slave trade and a corresponding member of the British movement. Washington would not have known of Lafayette's antislavery activities in Cayenne or Europe from Lafayette himself; although the two continued to correspond for the rest of Washington's life, the subject of slavery virtually disappeared from their letters. The Cayenne experiment came to an end in 1792, when the plantation was sold by the French Revolutionary government after Lafayette's imprisonment by the Austrians.<ref>Hirschfeld 1997 pp. 122\u2013128</ref><ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 261\u2013264</ref>}} Washington privately expressed support for emancipation to prominent Methodists [[Thomas Coke (bishop)|Thomas Coke]] and [[Francis Asbury]] in 1785, but declined to sign their petition.

He presided over the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] in 1787, during which it became obvious just how explosive the issue was and how willing the antislavery faction was to accept the preservation of slavery to ensure national unity and the establishment of a strong federal government. The support of the southern states for the new constitution was secured by granting them concessions that protected slavery, including the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]] and the [[Fugitive Slave Clause]], plus clauses that guaranteed the transatlantic slave trade for at least twenty years and federal aid for the suppression of any slave rebellion.<ref>Morgan 2005 p. 422</ref><ref>Twohig 2001 pp. 124\u2013125</ref>\n\nWashington's preeminent position ensured that any actions he took with regard to his own slaves would become a statement in a national debate about slavery that threatened to divide the country. Wiencek suggests Washington considered making precisely such a statement on taking up the presidency in 1789. A passage in the notebook of Washington's biographer [[David Humphreys (soldier)|David Humphreys]]{{efn|Humphreys was a former aide to Washington and had begun an eighteen-month stay at Mount Vernon in 1787 to assist Washington with his correspondence and write his biography.<ref>Ellis 2004 p. 153</ref>}} dated to late 1788 or early 1789 recorded a statement that resembled the emancipation clause in Washington's will a decade later. Wiencek argues the passage was a draft for a public announcement Washington was considering in which he would declare the emancipation of some of his slaves. It marks, Wiencek believes, a moral epiphany in Washington's thinking, the moment he decided not only to emancipate his slaves but also to use the occasion to set the example Lafayette had urged in 1783.<ref name=\"Wiencek272\u2013275\">Wiencek 2003 pp. 272\u2013275</ref> Other historians dispute Wiencek's conclusion; Henriques and [[Joseph Ellis]] concur with Philip Morgan's opinion that Washington experienced no epiphanies in a \"long and hard-headed struggle\" in which there was no single turning point. Morgan argues that Humphreys' passage is the \"private expression of remorse\" from a man unable to extricate himself from the \"tangled web\" of \"mutual dependency\" on slavery, and that Washington believed public comment on such a divisive subject was best avoided for the sake of national unity.<ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 421\u2013423, 425</ref><ref>Ellis 2004 p. 311 n22</ref><ref name=Henriques159 />{{efn|Wiencek bases his argument on the fact that the passage was written in the past tense and appears in Humphreys' notebook amid drafts Humphreys had written for public statements Washington was to make about assuming the presidency.<ref name=\"Wiencek272\u2013275\" /> Philip Morgan points out that the passage was Humphreys' words in Washington's voice and appears just after a summary Humphreys had written of [[Thomas Clarkson]]'s 1788 ''An Essay on the Impolicy of the African Slave Trade''.<ref>Morgan 2005 p. 423 n31</ref> Kenneth Morgan characterizes the passage as \"a remark made in [Washington's] voice by David Humphreys.\"<ref name=Morgan2000p298 /> Fritz Hirschfeld writes that the passage was written by Humphreys during direct dictation or from memory of Washington's exact words, and believes it highly improbable that they were not Washington's own words.<ref>Hirschfeld 1997 p. 213 n5</ref>}}\n\n====As President====\n{{See also|Presidency of George Washington}}\n[[File:George Washington 1795.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|''President George Washington'' by Gilbert Stuart (1795) |alt=Portrait painting]]\nWashington took up the presidency at a time when revolutionary sentiment against slavery was giving way to a resurgence of proslavery interests. No state considered making slavery an issue during the ratification of the new constitution, southern states reinforced their slavery legislation and prominent antislavery figures were muted about the issue in public. Washington understood there was little widespread organized support for abolition.<ref>Twohig 2001 pp. 125\u2013126</ref> He had a keen sense both of the fragility of the fledgling Republic and of his place as a unifying figure, and he was determined not to endanger either by confronting an issue as divisive and entrenched as slavery.<ref>Twohig 2001 pp. 126\u2013128</ref><ref>Morgan 2000 pp. 290, 295</ref> He was president of a government that passed a resolution in 1790 affirming states' rights to regulate treatment of slaves and legislate on slavery free of congressional interference, provided materiel and financial support in French efforts to suppress the [[Haitian Revolution|Saint Domingue slave revolt]] in 1791 and implemented the proslavery [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1793]].<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 275\u2013276</ref><ref>Twohig 2001 p. 130</ref><ref name=Morgan2000-297>Morgan 2000 p. 297</ref> He also signed into law the [[Slave Trade Act of 1794]] that sought to limit American involvement in the [[Atlantic slave trade|international slave trade]].<ref>Stathis 2014 pp. 17\u201318</ref> Washington never spoke publicly on the issue of slavery during his eight years as president, nor did he respond to, much less act upon, any of the antislavery petitions he received. He described a 1790 Quaker petition to [[United States Congress|Congress]] urging an immediate end to the slave trade as \"an illjudged piece of business\" that \"occasioned a great waste of time.\" The issue of slavery was not mentioned in either his last address to Congress or his [[George Washington's Farewell Address|Farewell Address]].<ref>Twohig 2001 p. 126</ref><ref>Boller 1961 pp. 85, 87</ref><ref>Ferling 2009 p. 363</ref>\n\nLate in his presidency, Washington told his [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], [[Edmund Randolph]], that in the event of a confrontation between North and South, he had \"made up his mind to remove and be of the Northern.\"<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 362</ref> In 1798, he imagined just such a conflict when he said, \"I can clearly foresee that nothing but the rooting out of slavery can perpetuate the existence of our union.\"<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 361\u2013362</ref><ref name=\"Hirschfeld 1997 pp. 72\u201373\"/> But there is no indication Washington ever favored an immediate end to slavery.

This plan would have involved breaking up slave families, but it was designed with an end goal of raising enough finances to fund their eventual emancipation (a detail Washington kept secret) and prevent the Custis heirs from permanently splitting up families by sale.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 339\u2013342</ref><ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 303\u2013304</ref>{{efn|The dower slaves had already begun to be transferred to Martha's granddaughters as the Custis heirs married.

The plan involved repossessing tenancies in [[Berkeley County, West Virginia|Berkeley]] and [[Frederick County, Virginia|Frederick]] Counties and transferring half of his Mount Vernon slaves to work them. It would, Washington hoped, \"yield more nett profit\" which might \"benefit myself and not render the [slaves'] condition worse\", despite the disruption such relocation would have had on the slave families.

Five freedwomen were listed as remaining: an unmarried mother of two children; two women, one of them with three children, married to Washington slaves too old to work; and two women who were married to dower slaves.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 311\u2013312</ref> William Lee remained at Mount Vernon, where he worked as a shoemaker.<ref>Schwartz 2017 p. 27</ref> After Martha's death on May 22, 1802, most of the remaining dower slaves passed to her grandson, [[George Washington Parke Custis]], to whom she bequeathed the only slave she held in her own name.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 341, 358</ref>\n\nThere are few records of how the newly freed slaves fared.<ref>Schwartz 2017 p. 35</ref> Custis later wrote that \"although many of them, with a view to their liberation, had been instructed in mechanic trades, yet they succeeded very badly as freemen; so true is the axiom, 'that the hour which makes man a slave, takes half his worth away'.\" The son-in-law of Custis's sister wrote in 1853 that the descendants of those who remained slaves, many of them now in his possession, had been \"prosperous, contented and happy,\" while those who had been freed had led a life of \"vice, dissipation and idleness\" and had, in their \"sickness, age and poverty\", become a burden to his in-laws.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 316</ref> Such reports were influenced by the innate racism of the well-educated, upper-class authors and ignored the social and legal impediments that prejudiced the chances of prosperity for former slaves, which included laws that made it illegal to teach freedpeople to read and write and, in 1806, required newly freed slaves to leave the state.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 317, 449 n83</ref><ref>Hirschfeld 1997 p. 215</ref>\n\nThere is evidence that some of Washington's former slaves were able to buy land, support their families and prosper as free people. By 1812, Free Town in [[Truro Parish, Virginia|Truro Parish]], the earliest known free African-American settlement in Fairfax County, contained seven households of former Washington slaves. By the mid 1800s, a son of Washington's carpenter Davy Jones and two grandsons of his [[postilion]] Joe Richardson had each bought land in Virginia. Francis Lee, younger brother of William, was well known and respected enough to have his obituary printed in the ''Alexandria Gazette'' on his death at Mount Vernon in 1821. Sambo Anderson{{snd}}who hunted game, as he had while Washington's slave, and prospered for a while by selling it to the most respectable families in Alexandria{{snd}}was similarly noted by the ''Gazette'' when he died near Mount Vernon in 1845.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 317\u2013319</ref> Research published in 2019 has concluded that Hercules worked as a cook in New York, where he died on May 15, 1812.<ref>Ganeshram 2019</ref>\n\nA decade after Washington's death, the Pennsylvanian jurist [[Richard Peters (Continental Congress)|Richard Peters]] wrote that Washington's servants \"were devoted to him; and especially those more immediately about his person. The survivors of them still venerate and adore his memory.\" In his old age, Anderson said he was \"a much happier man when he was a slave than he had ever been since,\" because he then \"had a good kind master to look after all my wants, but now I have no one to care for me.\"<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 322\u2013323</ref> When Judge was interviewed in the 1840s, she expressed considerable bitterness, not at the way she he had been treated as a slave, but at the fact that she had been enslaved. When asked, having experienced the hardships of being a freewoman and having outlived both husband and children, whether she regretted her escape, she replied, \"No, I am free, and have, I trust, been made a child of God by [that] means.\"<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 288\u2013289</ref>\n\n===Political legacy===\nWashington's will was both private testament and public statement on the institution.<ref name=Morgan2005p404>Morgan 2005 p. 404</ref><ref name=Morgan2000p298>Morgan 2000 p. 298</ref> It was published widely{{snd}}in newspapers nationwide, as a pamphlet which, in 1800 alone, extended to thirteen separate editions, and included in other works{{snd}}and became part of the nationalist narrative.<ref>Furstenberg 2006 pp. 84\u201385</ref> In the eulogies of the antislavery faction, the inconvenient fact of Washington's slaveholding was downplayed in favor of his final act of emancipation. Washington \"disdained to hold his fellow-creatures in abject domestic servitude,\" wrote the Massachusetts Federalist [[Timothy Bigelow (lawyer)|Timothy Bigelow]] before calling on \"fellow-citizens in the South\" to emulate Washington's example. In this narrative, Washington was a proto-abolitionist who, having added the freedom of his slaves to the freedom from British slavery he had won for the nation, would be mobilized to serve the antislavery cause.<ref>Furstenberg 2006 pp. 84\u201386</ref>\n\nAn alternative narrative more in line with proslavery sentiments embraced rather than excised Washington's ownership of slaves. Washington was cast as a paternal figure, the benevolent father not only of his country but also of a family of slaves bound to him by affection rather than coercion.<ref>Furstenberg 2006 pp. 92\u201394</ref> In this narrative, slaves idolized Washington and wept at his deathbed, and in an 1807 biography, [[Aaron Bancroft]] wrote, \"In domestick{{sic}} and private life, he blended the authority of the master with the care and kindness of the guardian and friend.\"<ref>Furstenberg 2006 pp. 94, 96\u201397</ref> The competing narratives allowed both [[Union (American Civil War)|North]] and [[Confederate States of America|South]] to claim Washington as the father of their countries during the [[American Civil War]] that ended slavery more than half a century after his death.<ref>Furstenberg 2006 pp. 100\u2013101</ref>\n\n===Memorial===\nIn 1929, a plaque was embedded in the ground at Mount Vernon less than {{convert|50|yd|m|round=5}} from the crypt housing the remains of Washington and Martha, marking a plot neglected by both groundsmen and tourist guides where slaves had been buried in unmarked graves. The inscription read, \"In memory of the many faithful colored servants of the Washington family, buried at Mount Vernon from 1760 to 1860. Their unidentified graves surround this spot.\" The site remained untended and ignored in the visitor literature until the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association erected a more prominent monument surrounded with plantings and inscribed, \"In memory of the Afro Americans who served as slaves at Mount Vernon this monument marking their burial ground dedicated September 21, 1983.\" In 1985, a [[ground-penetrating radar]] survey identified sixty-six possible burials. As of late 2017, an archaeological project begun in 2014 has identified, without disturbing the contents, sixty-three burial plots in addition to seven plots known before the project began.<ref>Hirschfeld 1997 pp. 217\u2013218</ref><ref>MVLA Slave Burial Ground Archaeology</ref><ref>MVLA Forgotten No Longer</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |last=Chernow |first=Ron |authorlink=Ron Chernow |title=Washington, A Life |title-link=Washington: A Life |type=e-book |publisher=Allen Lane |location=London, United Kingdom |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-141-96610-6 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Ellis |first=Joseph J. |authorlink=Joseph Ellis |title=His Excellency: George Washington |publisher=Alfred A.

His most productive season came in 1927, when he posted career-highs with a .316 [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]], 92 [[run batted in|RBI]], 57 [[run (baseball)|runs]], and 152 [[games played|games]] while playing three different infield positions for the Giants and Braves, being considered in the [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|National League MVP]] vote at the end of the season. He played exclusively at shortstop 132 games for the 1928 Braves and also won a [[World Series ring]] with the [[1932 World Series|Yankees 1932 World Champions]], despite he did not play in the Series.\n\nIn a nine-season career, Farrell was a .260 hitter (467-for-1799) with ten [[home run]]s and 213 RBI in 591 games, including 181 runs, 63 [[double (baseball)|doubles]], eight [[triple (baseball)|triples]], and 14 [[stolen base]]s. As a fielder, he appeared in 553 games at shortstop (376), [[second baseman|second base]] (118), [[third baseman|third base]] (56) and [[first baseman|first base]] (3).\n\nFarrell died in [[Livingston, New Jersey]], just six days shy of his 65th birthday. In his last will and testament, he requested that none of his grandchildren become fans of the Yankees organization due to issues with the team\u2019s administration in his final year with the team.\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.baseball-reference.com/f/farredo01.shtml Baseball Reference]\n\n{{1932 New York Yankees}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Farrell, Doc}}\n[[Category:Boston Braves players]]\n[[Category:Boston Red Sox players]]\n[[Category:Chicago Cubs players]]\n[[Category:New York Giants (NL) players]]\n[[Category:New York Yankees players]]\n[[Category:St. Louis Cardinals players]]\n[[Category:Major League Baseball shortstops]]\n[[Category:Baseball players from New York (state)]]\n[[Category:1901 births]]\n[[Category:1966 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Johnson City, New York]]\n", "name_user": "50.0.246.56", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Farrell"}

The show follows the loves and lives of the people living in the Orange County coastal area named Sunset Beach, on the coast of [[California]]. Although there is a town in California called [[Sunset Beach, California|Sunset Beach]], the show's beach scenes were shot on nearby [[Seal Beach]]. The show was co-produced by NBC and [[Spelling Television]].\n\n''Sunset Beach'' won two [[Daytime Emmy Awards]] and was nominated another eleven times. The show also received twenty-two nominations for various other awards.<ref>\"[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118484/awards Emmy Awards]\" ''NBC'', URL last accessed 2008-06-16</ref>\n\n==Conception and development==\n''Sunset Beach'' was created in 1996, in an attempt to rebuild the [[NBC Daytime]] lineup and target the younger audience. It was the first daytime soap opera produced by [[Aaron Spelling]], the chief of [[Spelling Television]] (Spelling had also produced several primetime soap operas, and was the executive producer of the 1991 film ''[[Soapdish]]'', a satirical look at daytime soap operas). Jonathan Levin, one of the show's consulting producers, commented on the change that a new soap opera brings to the lineup, and the tough process of a viewer getting to know a new soap: \"It is very difficult to change the loyalty of the daytime viewer, and we\u2019re talking about shows that have been on for 30 years. That's one of the reasons we\u2019re targeting young viewers \u2014 they\u2019re the most available and the most flexible in their viewing habits.\"<ref>[http://boards.soapoperanetwork.com/index.php?showtopic=25459&st=0 Levin comment]</ref>\n\nIn the process of making the show, Spelling liked the idea of naming it ''Never Say Goodbye'', as suggested by [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]] chairman [[Sumner Redstone]] during a dinner with Spelling, but later tests proved that the viewers were more drawn to the title ''Sunset Beach''. Upon its premiere, ''Sunset Beach'' was made part of the NBC Daytime programming block.  At first, the show was given a one-year deal, with 255 episodes to produce. The show was renewed again for another year, and then picked up in six-month intervals for its final year in 1999.\n\nBefore getting cancelled, the show was renewed twice, but it failed to grab the show's audience. Through its short existence, ''Sunset Beach'' remained in the daytime [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] basement. However, during the ''Shockwave'' storyline, it received its best ratings and showed signs that it might move off the bottom. This spike proved to be brief and was not sustained.<ref>[[List of US daytime soap opera ratings|Nielsen Ratings]], ''Info on Nielsen Ratings''</ref>\n\n==Cast and crew==\n{{Main|List of Sunset Beach characters|List of Sunset Beach crew|List of Sunset Beach cast members}}\n[[Image:Cast01.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Cast circa 1997.<br />First row: Cole, Annie, Tim<br />Second row: Caitlin, Mark, Meg, Eddie<br />Third row: Tiffany, Ricardo, Paula, Ben, Vanessa, Michael, Sean]]\nWhen the show first aired, it started with 21 contract characters, of which 7 left the show during its first year and a half. The first actress to leave the series was [[Adrienne Frantz]]. Her character was recast with Jennifer Banko Stewart, but the change didn't work out, resulting in the character eventually being written out. [[Kelly Hu]] left the show in June 1997, due to her character not mixing well with the others. By the end of the year, when [[Meg Bennett]] took over as a new head writer, [[Leigh Taylor-Young]] and [[Laura Harring]] also left the series, followed by the exit of [[Nick Stabile]], whose character was written out in a serial killer storyline. [[Elizabeth Alley]] had a short stint in the role of Melinda Fall. The final original character to be written off was Eddie Connors, played by [[Peter Barton (actor)|Peter Barton]], who exited in mid-1998.\n\nThe remaining 14 original characters stayed on the show until its end, and three of those characters were recast during the three-year run. The first recast happened soon after the show started airing. The role of [[Cole Deschanel]] a male jewel thief, initially played by [[Ashley Hamilton]], was recast with [[Eddie Cibrian]]. In mid-1998, following contract disputes, [[Vanessa Dorman]] vacated the role of Cole's girlfriend, later wife [[Caitlin Deschanel]], and [[Kam Heskin]] was cast. The final recast was a temporary one. When [[Susan Ward]] left for a while to film a movie, [[Sydney Penny]] stepped in to replace her, with Ward later returning to play the character for the show's final few weeks. Shortly after the show premiered, [[Dominique Jennings]], [[V. P. Oliver]], and [[Russell Curry]] joined the cast. Oliver was let go in December 1997, and his character, Jimmy Harrison, was recast with a younger actor, [[Jeffery Wood]]. Both Jennings and Wood were written off by March 1999, exactly two years after the introduction of their characters.\n\nThe exits of many characters opened the doors to the introduction of new ones. [[Carol Potter (actress)|Carol Potter]] and [[John Martin (actor)|John Martin]], who had been recurring during the show's first year, were promoted to contract status, and the expansion of Meg's family also included the arrival of her sister [[Sara Cummings|Sara]]. The role was first played by then-unknown actress [[Lauren Woodland]], but she was fired two weeks later and replaced by [[Shawn Batten]], who played the role for the remainder of the series. Aside from Meg's family, [[Ricardo Torres (Sunset Beach)|Ricardo]] got his family expanded, including the introduction of his mother Carmen ([[Margarita Cordova]]), brother Antonio ([[Nick Kiriazis]]), and the sudden reappearance of his sister Maria ([[Christina Chambers]]), Ben Evans' presumed dead wife.\n\nThe teen scene was revived in 1998, when Bette's daughter Emily ([[Cristi Harris]]) arrived in town and fell in love with Sean, prompting Amy (Krissy Carlson) and Brad ([[Michael Strickland (actor)|Michael Strickland]]) to intervene. The final teen cast was Leo Deschanel, Cole's brother ([[David Mathiessen]]), but he was quickly written out. A long-time legend and Cole's father, A.J. Deschanel, was also cast in the form of [[Gordon Thomson (actor)|Gordon Thomson]], and a female jewel thief named Francesca ([[Lisa Guerrero]]) was added to the cast in mid-1998. However, Guerrero was written out in early 1999 since her character was killed by Gregory.\n\nIn 1999, the show cast only three contract roles, the first two being in March, when [[Tracy Melchior|Tracy Lindsey Melchior]] and [[Chase Parker]] stunned the soap with their sudden arrival in town. The final role to be cast on the show was the one played by [[Sean Kanan]] in late August. Things changed at the end of the year, when fan favorite [[Eddie Cibrian]] left the show to pursue a career in primetime. Several other cast members, including a few original ones, considered leaving, but the show's cancellation came before they could make a decision.\n\nDuring its three-year run, ''Sunset Beach'' was executive produced by [[Aaron Spelling]], [[E. Duke Vincent]], and [[Gary Tomlin]]. However, the head writing history was much different. [[Robert Guza Jr.]] was the first head writer (and also a co-creator), but he exited the show on October 21, 1997, when [[Meg Bennett]], who had been serving as Associate Head Writer was promoted as head writer as of October 22. Four months after being the sole head writer, Bennett received a co-head writer in the form of [[Christopher Whitesell]], on January 8, 1998. Bennett was dismissed during the summer of 1998 and her final episode aired October 5, 1998. She was replaced by [[Margaret DePriest]], who stayed with the show until its cancellation.\n\n==Storylines==\nStorylines in its nearly three-year run ranged from the traditional to the [[supernatural]]. One of the first storylines concerned an Internet romance. Kansas farm girl [[Meg Cummings]] discovered her fianc\u00e9, [[Tim Truman (Sunset Beach)|Tim Truman]], cheating on her on their wedding day. Meg had been talking online with SB, a man who lived in Sunset Beach, California. And after catching Tim with her maid of honor, Meg fled to Sunset Beach in search of SB, who turned out to be wealthy, widowed businessman [[Ben Evans (Sunset Beach)|Ben Evans]].\n\n{{quotation|When the moon rises early, just as the Santa Ana winds kicks up out of nowhere, and the sun is just dropping out of sight, whoever you meet at the far side of the pier, is who you're destined to be with.

A side plot showed the antagonistic relationship between Meg and [[Annie Douglas Richards|Annie Douglas]], Ben's longtime best friend. Meg hated Annie for being close to Ben and wanted to cut her out of his life; Annie hated Meg out of jealousy for her developing romance with Ben. Their problems reached a head with a physical fight in a hot tub. Meg's ex-fianc\u00e9 Tim Truman followed her to Sunset Beach to win her back, and ended up becoming Annie's ally and almost love interest. Once Meg and Annie had overcome their differences, Meg soon had a new problem when she began to suspect Ben was a murderer, although this plot line was developed to lead up to the Terror Island storyline. After the Terror Island/Derek storyline (see below) none of the issues raised were ever mentioned again.\n\nMeg and Ben became one of the show's first couples, along with jewel thief [[Cole Deschanel]] and local heiress [[Caitlin Richards Deschanel|Caitlin Richards]]. Cole slept with and impregnated both Caitlin and Caitlin's unhappy alcoholic mother [[Olivia Richards|Olivia]]. Olivia and her fiendish ex-husband, [[Gregory Richards|Gregory]], planned to steal Caitlin's baby and pass it off as Olivia's (telling Caitlin her baby had died) in order to break up Caitlin's relationship with Cole, who her parents disapproved of because of his criminal past. Caitlin lost the child in a car accident when she found out about her parents' horrible plan, and planned to fake the rest of her pregnancy and adopt a baby to pass off as her own, as she was worried her inability to have children (caused by the accident) would cause problems in her marriage to Cole. She enlisted the help of Annie, who was secretly trying to break up Olivia and Gregory, due to a term in her father's will that stated she would only get her inheritance if she wed Gregory (her father's way of breaking up his marriage to Olivia, who he had been having an affair with) Annie drugged Olivia and stole her baby, telling her the baby had been stillborn. Caitlin (unknowingly) raised her baby half-brother (who was also her step-son, having been fathered by her husband) until a grief-stricken Olivia discovered the truth. Olivia was eventually reunited with her son.\n\nWhen the show began, it was the only soap on the air featuring Asian-American characters, though they were written off before the end of the first year. The show also had daytime television's only African-American villainess, [[Virginia Harrison]], who schemed to break up [[lifeguard]] [[Michael Bourne]] and reporter [[Vanessa Hart]] so she could have Michael for herself.\n\n===Prominent storylines===\nIn one of the most outrageous storylines on the show, Virginia drugged Vanessa and, using a [[turkey baster]] and some stolen sperm, impregnated her with the child of [[Tyus Robinson]], to make it appear Vanessa had been unfaithful to Michael, who was [[Infertility|sterile]].\n\nThe show was known for other outrageous storylines, such as ''Terror Island'' in which several of the show's main characters were stranded on an island with a masked serial killer (whose costume bore a close resemblance to that of the killer from ''[[Scream (film series)|Scream]]'') intent on killing them, especially Meg. A handful of characters were killed by the maniac, mostly minor characters introduced as serial killer-fodder, but also one lead character, young runaway made good [[Mark Wolper]]. In his dying moments Mark pulled off the killer's mask and audiences were stunned to see Ben's face behind it. As it turned out, Ben had an evil twin, [[Derek Evans (Sunset Beach)|Derek]], who plagued Ben and Meg's lives off and on for the rest of the run of the show. Derek was killed after being shot in a struggle with Ben during the show's final weeks, following a long storyline where Derek kidnapped and impersonated his twin for months, sleeping with Ben's wife [[Maria Torres|Maria]] (having previously also slept with Meg).\n\n[[Maria Torres Evans]], who had wed Ben when she was still a teenager and he was barely in his twenties, had disappeared and been presumed drowned after a boating accident that took place some years prior to the start of the show. Ben was haunted by the terrible secret that he had caught her in bed with Derek (it was later revealed that Derek\u2014who had impersonated Ben to Maria, who was unaware Ben had a twin\u2014had not slept with Maria, as she had stabbed him with scissors when he tried to rape her). Ben's guilt and grief over Maria caused a shadow over his relationship with Meg from the beginning, which worsened when an amnesiac Maria came back from the dead at Ben and Meg's October 1998 wedding. Ben and Maria grew closer while he helped her to regain her memory, and once she did, Ben flip flopped between the two women for much of the rest of the show's run. During the show's last year a strange woman, Tess, turned up on his doorstep with a son she claimed was Ben and Maria's. After a positive paternity test they raised the child, [[Benjy Evans|Benjy]], together, causing even more problems for Meg, who left Ben and briefly started dating her sister's boyfriend, [[Casey Mitchum|Casey]]. Derek (who was also wrongfully presumed dead) returned to kidnap Ben again, and it was revealed he and Tess were Benjy's parents.\n\nAnother outrageous storyline was the earthquake/[[tsunami]] story, in which Sunset Beach was struck by a massive earthquake, trapping many characters \u2013 most of them each other's rival \u2013 together in life and death situations. While half the cast battled the disaster on land, the rest of the cast was on a pleasure cruise aboard a ship that was overturned \u2013 \u00e0 la ''[[The Poseidon Adventure (novel)|The Poseidon Adventure]]'' \u2013 by a tsunami created by the earthquake. This storyline was in many ways similar to the plot of ''The Poseidon Adventure''.\n\nThe tsunami storyline proved so popular that two weeks' worth of episodes were compiled and turned into an hour-long show that was included on NBC's lineup for one night in August 1998. The show took a [[supernatural]] turn for a while with some cursed jewels, stolen from a religious icon, that turned those who'd touched them into shriveled mummies. The story culminated on [[Christmas Eve]] with the return of the jewels to the Madonna just in time to prevent the deaths of several key characters.\n\nThe show also featured two murder mysteries in its run. The first was the murder of Annie's father Del Douglas by [[Elaine Stevens]]. Del had kidnapped Cole as a baby and convinced Elaine the child was dead). The second murder mystery involved the death of seductress and jewel thief [[Francesca Vargas]], whom just about everyone in town wanted dead. The twist in the Who Shot Francesca storyline and the killer was main antagonist character [[Gregory Richards]].\n\n===Cancellation===\nThe show was cancelled just before the third anniversary of its original air date. Most of the main characters were given happy endings.<ref>[http://www.tv.com/sunset-beach/episode-755/episode/469509/recap.html Final Episode Recap]</ref> Ben and Meg and Michael and Vanessa married in a double wedding. Casey and Sara got engaged, Cole and Caitlin were happy in their marriage, and Olivia was happily raising her children alone. Maria gave Ben a divorce so he could marry Meg and met a new man, Ross English. Maria also adopted Benjy, the little boy she had regarded as her own, and she and Ben planned to raise him together. The 'baddies' all got their comeuppances. Derek was accidentally shot and killed by Ben; his accomplice Tess went to jail, as did Gregory Richards (Francesca's real killer). Tim Truman, who though not a villain spent most of the three years causing problems for Ben and Meg, was murdered by Derek. Virginia remained in a mental hospital of the criminally insane, while reformed Annie also got a happy ending, finding love with relatively new character Jude.\n\nIn a twist ending, Meg appeared to wake up in [[Kansas]] and realize that the entire three years in Sunset Beach had been a dream \u2013 and the characters from the show were actually her friends and family in Kansas (a reference to ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'').{{Original research inline|date=August 2010}} However, at the last minute, Meg woke up in Sunset Beach and was in bed with Ben, the day after their wedding. Probably the dream was poking fun at how many writers use the sloppy ending of \"it was all a dream\" to bring a story to a close, as was done in stories such as ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'' or more aptly, evoking the dream (9th) season of the prime-time soap, ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]''.\n\nThe show gained a cult following in the UK, doing especially well in the ratings for [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]], with some universities holding ''Sunset Beach'' parties where students would go dressed as their favorite character. Channel 5 tried to save the show when its cancellation was announced, offering partially to fund it and trying to get other networks involved, as had happened previously with ''[[Baywatch]]'', but NBC was not interested. It did buy NBC's other soap opera, ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'', to air in ''Sunset Beach''\u2019s place, even running promos during ''Sunset Beach''\u2019s final week, but the show failed to catch on and Channel 5 dropped ''Days'' approximately a year later.\n\nTo date, ''Sunset Beach'' is the last regularly-scheduled NBC network program to air at 12:00&nbsp;p.m. Some NBC affiliates did not air ''Sunset Beach'' at its scheduled time due to the affiliates' longstanding practice of airing local newscasts or other syndicated programming in the noon hour; this resulted in some affiliates airing the show in a different spot on their schedule while others did not air it at all. In some media markets (especially in [[WKBD-TV|Detroit]] and [[KTXH|Houston]], where [[Post-Newsweek Stations]], the owner of [[WDIV-TV|WDIV]] and [[KPRC-TV]] at the time, preempted it for its entire run), ''Sunset Beach'' aired on affiliates of other networks or independent stations. In most markets that did air the show at its regular time, its second half-hour went up against the first half-hour of ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' on CBS and ''[[Port Charles]]'' on ABC. After the series ended, NBC returned the 12:00&nbsp;p.m. time slot to its affiliates.\n\n==International broadcasting==\n{{cleanup section|date=October 2011}}\n\nIn Australia, ''Sunset Beach'' aired on [[Network Ten]] from 1998 to 2000 in an early morning time slot.\n\nIn Bulgaria, ''Sunset Beach'' aired on [[Nova Television (Bulgaria)|Nova Television]] weekdays in 2001-2004 (all episodes), and on [[CBS Drama]] since January 2015.\n\nIn Canada, ''Sunset Beach'' aired at 3:00PM on independent station [[CHCH]] in Hamilton, Ontario; the show was broadcast the same day as NBC.<ref>{{Cite pressrelease|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970103004725/http://www.chch.com/press/current/sunset.htm |title=\"Sunset Beach\" a sizzling new daytime drama from Aaron Spelling, premieres January 6, 1997 on CHCH-TV |date=December 24, 1996 |archivedate=January 3, 1997 |accessdate=March 16, 2012 |publisher=Niagara Television Limited|url=http://www.chch.com/press/current/sunset.htm }}</ref>\n\nIn Croatia, ''Sunset Beach'' aired on [[Croatian radio television|HRT1]] (all episodes) weekdays at 6.30pm from September 1998 to May 2001.\n\nIn France, ''Sunset Beach'' aired on [[Fox life|TF1]].\n\nIn Ireland, ''Sunset Beach'' aired on [[TV3 (Ireland)|TV3]] weekdays at 2.30pm from 20 September 1998 to August 2001 - all 755 episodes aired.

Sara went on to develop a relationship with local lifeguard Casey Mitchum, and their relationship and her sibling rivalry with her sister (who at one point started an affair with Casey) made up the bulk of Sara's storylines, although she was also famous for her TV show-inspired fantasy sequences, which included spoofs of the opening titles for ''Friends'' and ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]''.\n\nOther notable guest appearances include [[Finola Hughes]] as Cole's ex-fianc\u00e9e Helena, [[Christopher Darden]] as Les Gordon, [[John O'Hurley]] as the host of ''Wheel of Misfortune'', [[Kim Alexis]] as a hotel maid, [[Jack Wagner (actor)|Jack Wagner]] as a thief named Jacques Dumont, and [[Barbara Mandrell]] as Casey's ill mother Alex Mitchum.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.facebook.com/pages/Sunset-Beach/103110746395508?fref=ts Sunset Beach] at [[Facebook]]\n*{{IMDb title|id=0118484|title=Sunset Beach}}\n*{{Tv.com show|sunset-beach|Sunset Beach}}\n*[https://sunsetbeachonline.com Sunset Beach Online - Website about the soap opera Sunset Beach ]\n*[http://antonio-gabi.xooit.com/index.php French forum about Antonio and Gabi's story \u2665 ]\n\n{{Sunset Beach (TV series)}}\n{{US daytime soaps}}\n{{Soap operas in the United Kingdom}}\n{{Aaron Spelling}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sunset Beach (TV Series)}}\n[[Category:1997 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1999 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:1990s American drama television series]]\n[[Category:American television soap operas]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:NBC original programming]]\n[[Category:Television series by Spelling Television]]\n[[Category:Television series by Universal Television]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in Orange County, California]]\n[[Category:NBC network soap operas]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television\n| show_name = Sunset Beach\n| image = Subelogo.jpg\n| caption = <small>An image from the second opening title sequence of ''Sunset Beach'' (introduced on August 4, 1997)<ref>\"[http://www.tv.com/sunset-beach/episode-140/episode/409359/summary.html]\", ''Episode 140''.

The show follows the loves and lives of the people living in the Orange County coastal area named Sunset Beach, on the coast of [[California]]. Although there is a town in California called [[Sunset Beach, California|Sunset Beach]], the show's beach scenes were shot on nearby [[Seal Beach]]. The show was co-produced by NBC and [[Spelling Television]].\n\n''Sunset Beach'' won two [[Daytime Emmy Awards]] and was nominated another eleven times. The show also received twenty-two nominations for various other awards.<ref>\"[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118484/awards Emmy Awards]\" ''NBC'', URL last accessed 2008-06-16</ref>\n\n==Conception and development==\n''Sunset Beach'' was created in 1996, in an attempt to rebuild the [[NBC Daytime]] lineup and target the younger audience. It was the first daytime soap opera produced by [[Aaron Spelling]], the chief of [[Spelling Television]] (Spelling had also produced several primetime soap operas, and was the executive producer of the 1991 film ''[[Soapdish]]'', a satirical look at daytime soap operas). Jonathan Levin, one of the show's consulting producers, commented on the change that a new soap opera brings to the lineup, and the tough process of a viewer getting to know a new soap: \"It is very difficult to change the loyalty of the daytime viewer, and we\u2019re talking about shows that have been on for 30 years. That's one of the reasons we\u2019re targeting young viewers \u2014 they\u2019re the most available and the most flexible in their viewing habits.\"<ref>[http://boards.soapoperanetwork.com/index.php?showtopic=25459&st=0 Levin comment]</ref>\n\nIn the process of making the show, Spelling liked the idea of naming it ''Never Say Goodbye'', as suggested by [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]] chairman [[Sumner Redstone]] during a dinner with Spelling, but later tests proved that the viewers were more drawn to the title ''Sunset Beach''. Upon its premiere, ''Sunset Beach'' was made part of the NBC Daytime programming block.  At first, the show was given a one-year deal, with 255 episodes to produce. The show was renewed again for another year, and then picked up in six-month intervals for its final year in 1999.\n\nBefore getting cancelled, the show was renewed twice, but it failed to grab the show's audience. Through its short existence, ''Sunset Beach'' remained in the daytime [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] basement. However, during the ''Shockwave'' storyline, it received its best ratings and showed signs that it might move off the bottom. This spike proved to be brief and was not sustained.<ref>[[List of US daytime soap opera ratings|Nielsen Ratings]], ''Info on Nielsen Ratings''</ref>\n\n==Cast and crew==\n{{Main|List of Sunset Beach characters|List of Sunset Beach crew|List of Sunset Beach cast members}}\n[[Image:Cast01.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Cast circa 1997.<br />First row: Cole, Annie, Tim<br />Second row: Caitlin, Mark, Meg, Eddie<br />Third row: Tiffany, Ricardo, Paula, Ben, Vanessa, Michael, Sean]]\nWhen the show first aired, it started with 21 contract characters, of which 7 left the show during its first year and a half. The first actress to leave the series was [[Adrienne Frantz]]. Her character was recast with Jennifer Banko Stewart, but the change didn't work out, resulting in the character eventually being written out. [[Kelly Hu]] left the show in June 1997, due to her character not mixing well with the others. By the end of the year, when [[Meg Bennett]] took over as a new head writer, [[Leigh Taylor-Young]] and [[Laura Harring]] also left the series, followed by the exit of [[Nick Stabile]], whose character was written out in a serial killer storyline. [[Elizabeth Alley]] had a short stint in the role of Melinda Fall. The final original character to be written off was Eddie Connors, played by [[Peter Barton (actor)|Peter Barton]], who exited in mid-1998.\n\nThe remaining 14 original characters stayed on the show until its end, and three of those characters were recast during the three-year run. The first recast happened soon after the show started airing. The role of [[Cole Deschanel]] a male jewel thief, initially played by [[Ashley Hamilton]], was recast with [[Eddie Cibrian]]. In mid-1998, following contract disputes, [[Vanessa Dorman]] vacated the role of Cole's girlfriend, later wife [[Caitlin Deschanel]], and [[Kam Heskin]] was cast. The final recast was a temporary one. When [[Susan Ward]] left for a while to film a movie, [[Sydney Penny]] stepped in to replace her, with Ward later returning to play the character for the show's final few weeks. Shortly after the show premiered, [[Dominique Jennings]], [[V. P. Oliver]], and [[Russell Curry]] joined the cast. Oliver was let go in December 1997, and his character, Jimmy Harrison, was recast with a younger actor, [[Jeffery Wood]]. Both Jennings and Wood were written off by March 1999, exactly two years after the introduction of their characters.\n\nThe exits of many characters opened the doors to the introduction of new ones. [[Carol Potter (actress)|Carol Potter]] and [[John Martin (actor)|John Martin]], who had been recurring during the show's first year, were promoted to contract status, and the expansion of Meg's family also included the arrival of her sister [[Sara Cummings|Sara]]. The role was first played by then-unknown actress [[Lauren Woodland]], but she was fired two weeks later and replaced by [[Shawn Batten]], who played the role for the remainder of the series. Aside from Meg's family, [[Ricardo Torres (Sunset Beach)|Ricardo]] got his family expanded, including the introduction of his mother Carmen ([[Margarita Cordova]]), brother Antonio ([[Nick Kiriazis]]), and the sudden reappearance of his sister Maria ([[Christina Chambers]]), Ben Evans' presumed dead wife.\n\nThe teen scene was revived in 1998, when Bette's daughter Emily ([[Cristi Harris]]) arrived in town and fell in love with Sean, prompting Amy (Krissy Carlson) and Brad ([[Michael Strickland (actor)|Michael Strickland]]) to intervene. The final teen cast was Leo Deschanel, Cole's brother ([[David Mathiessen]]), but he was quickly written out. A long-time legend and Cole's father, A.J. Deschanel, was also cast in the form of [[Gordon Thomson (actor)|Gordon Thomson]], and a female jewel thief named Francesca ([[Lisa Guerrero]]) was added to the cast in mid-1998. However, Guerrero was written out in early 1999 since her character was killed by Gregory.\n\nIn 1999, the show cast only three contract roles, the first two being in March, when [[Tracy Melchior|Tracy Lindsey Melchior]] and [[Chase Parker]] stunned the soap with their sudden arrival in town. The final role to be cast on the show was the one played by [[Sean Kanan]] in late August. Things changed at the end of the year, when fan favorite [[Eddie Cibrian]] left the show to pursue a career in primetime. Several other cast members, including a few original ones, considered leaving, but the show's cancellation came before they could make a decision.\n\nDuring its three-year run, ''Sunset Beach'' was executive produced by [[Aaron Spelling]], [[E. Duke Vincent]], and [[Gary Tomlin]]. However, the head writing history was much different. [[Robert Guza Jr.]] was the first head writer (and also a co-creator), but he exited the show on October 21, 1997, when [[Meg Bennett]], who had been serving as Associate Head Writer was promoted as head writer as of October 22. Four months after being the sole head writer, Bennett received a co-head writer in the form of [[Christopher Whitesell]], on January 8, 1998. Bennett was dismissed during the summer of 1998 and her final episode aired October 5, 1998. She was replaced by [[Margaret DePriest]], who stayed with the show until its cancellation.\n\n==Storylines==\nStorylines in its nearly three-year run ranged from the traditional to the [[supernatural]]. One of the first storylines concerned an Internet romance. Kansas farm girl [[Meg Cummings]] discovered her fianc\u00e9, [[Tim Truman (Sunset Beach)|Tim Truman]], cheating on her on their wedding day. Meg had been talking online with SB, a man who lived in Sunset Beach, California. And after catching Tim with her maid of honor, Meg fled to Sunset Beach in search of SB, who turned out to be wealthy, widowed businessman [[Ben Evans (Sunset Beach)|Ben Evans]].\n\n{{quotation|When the moon rises early, just as the Santa Ana winds kicks up out of nowhere, and the sun is just dropping out of sight, whoever you meet at the far side of the pier, is who you're destined to be with. [[Elaine Stevens]] ''(the legend of Sunset Beach)''<ref name=\"TV.com\">{{cite news| title= Sunset Beach Season 1 Episode 1 |publisher=[[TV.com]]|accessdate=2008-06-16|url=http://www.tv.com/sunset-beach/episode-001/episode/299451/trivia.html#notes Legend of SuBe}}</ref>}}The first year of the show revolved around Meg's pursuit of Ben (including her briefly breaking into his house, stealing a journal she found there, and dressing up in his late wife's clothes), who was initially not interested in her, and the gradual development of a romance between them. A side plot showed the antagonistic relationship between Meg and [[Annie Douglas Richards|Annie Douglas]], Ben's longtime best friend. Meg hated Annie for being close to Ben and wanted to cut her out of his life; Annie hated Meg out of jealousy for her developing romance with Ben. Their problems reached a head with a physical fight in a hot tub. Meg's ex-fianc\u00e9 Tim Truman followed her to Sunset Beach to win her back, and ended up becoming Annie's ally and almost love interest. Once Meg and Annie had overcome their differences, Meg soon had a new problem when she began to suspect Ben was a murderer, although this plot line was developed to lead up to the Terror Island storyline. After the Terror Island/Derek storyline (see below) none of the issues raised were ever mentioned again.\n\nMeg and Ben became one of the show's first couples, along with jewel thief [[Cole Deschanel]] and local heiress [[Caitlin Richards Deschanel|Caitlin Richards]]. Cole slept with and impregnated both Caitlin and Caitlin's unhappy alcoholic mother [[Olivia Richards|Olivia]]. Olivia and her fiendish ex-husband, [[Gregory Richards|Gregory]], planned to steal Caitlin's baby and pass it off as Olivia's (telling Caitlin her baby had died) in order to break up Caitlin's relationship with Cole, who her parents disapproved of because of his criminal past. Caitlin lost the child in a car accident when she found out about her parents' horrible plan, and planned to fake the rest of her pregnancy and adopt a baby to pass off as her own, as she was worried her inability to have children (caused by the accident) would cause problems in her marriage to Cole. She enlisted the help of Annie, who was secretly trying to break up Olivia and Gregory, due to a term in her father's will that stated she would only get her inheritance if she wed Gregory (her father's way of breaking up his marriage to Olivia, who he had been having an affair with) Annie drugged Olivia and stole her baby, telling her the baby had been stillborn. Caitlin (unknowingly) raised her baby half-brother (who was also her step-son, having been fathered by her husband) until a grief-stricken Olivia discovered the truth. Olivia was eventually reunited with her son.\n\nWhen the show began, it was the only soap on the air featuring Asian-American characters, though they were written off before the end of the first year. The show also had daytime television's only African-American villainess, [[Virginia Harrison]], who schemed to break up [[lifeguard]] [[Michael Bourne]] and reporter [[Vanessa Hart]] so she could have Michael for herself.\n\n===Prominent storylines===\nIn one of the most outrageous storylines on the show, Virginia drugged Vanessa and, using a [[turkey baster]] and some stolen sperm, impregnated her with the child of [[Tyus Robinson]], to make it appear Vanessa had been unfaithful to Michael, who was [[Infertility|sterile]].\n\nThe show was known for other outrageous storylines, such as ''Terror Island'' in which several of the show's main characters were stranded on an island with a masked serial killer (whose costume bore a close resemblance to that of the killer from ''[[Scream (film series)|Scream]]'') intent on killing them, especially Meg. A handful of characters were killed by the maniac, mostly minor characters introduced as serial killer-fodder, but also one lead character, young runaway made good [[Mark Wolper]]. In his dying moments Mark pulled off the killer's mask and audiences were stunned to see Ben's face behind it. As it turned out, Ben had an evil twin, [[Derek Evans (Sunset Beach)|Derek]], who plagued Ben and Meg's lives off and on for the rest of the run of the show. Derek was killed after being shot in a struggle with Ben during the show's final weeks, following a long storyline where Derek kidnapped and impersonated his twin for months, sleeping with Ben's wife [[Maria Torres|Maria]] (having previously also slept with Meg).\n\n[[Maria Torres Evans]], who had wed Ben when she was still a teenager and he was barely in his twenties, had disappeared and been presumed drowned after a boating accident that took place some years prior to the start of the show. Ben was haunted by the terrible secret that he had caught her in bed with Derek (it was later revealed that Derek\u2014who had impersonated Ben to Maria, who was unaware Ben had a twin\u2014had not slept with Maria, as she had stabbed him with scissors when he tried to rape her). Ben's guilt and grief over Maria caused a shadow over his relationship with Meg from the beginning, which worsened when an amnesiac Maria came back from the dead at Ben and Meg's October 1998 wedding. Ben and Maria grew closer while he helped her to regain her memory, and once she did, Ben flip flopped between the two women for much of the rest of the show's run. During the show's last year a strange woman, Tess, turned up on his doorstep with a son she claimed was Ben and Maria's. After a positive paternity test they raised the child, [[Benjy Evans|Benjy]], together, causing even more problems for Meg, who left Ben and briefly started dating her sister's boyfriend, [[Casey Mitchum|Casey]]. Derek (who was also wrongfully presumed dead) returned to kidnap Ben again, and it was revealed he and Tess were Benjy's parents.\n\nAnother outrageous storyline was the earthquake/[[tsunami]] story, in which Sunset Beach was struck by a massive earthquake, trapping many characters \u2013 most of them each other's rival \u2013 together in life and death situations. While half the cast battled the disaster on land, the rest of the cast was on a pleasure cruise aboard a ship that was overturned \u2013 \u00e0 la ''[[The Poseidon Adventure (novel)|The Poseidon Adventure]]'' \u2013 by a tsunami created by the earthquake. This storyline was in many ways similar to the plot of ''The Poseidon Adventure''.\n\nThe tsunami storyline proved so popular that two weeks' worth of episodes were compiled and turned into an hour-long show that was included on NBC's lineup for one night in August 1998. The show took a [[supernatural]] turn for a while with some cursed jewels, stolen from a religious icon, that turned those who'd touched them into shriveled mummies. The story culminated on [[Christmas Eve]] with the return of the jewels to the Madonna just in time to prevent the deaths of several key characters.\n\nThe show also featured two murder mysteries in its run. The first was the murder of Annie's father Del Douglas by [[Elaine Stevens]]. Del had kidnapped Cole as a baby and convinced Elaine the child was dead). The second murder mystery involved the death of seductress and jewel thief [[Francesca Vargas]], whom just about everyone in town wanted dead. The twist in the Who Shot Francesca storyline and the killer was main antagonist character [[Gregory Richards]].\n\n===Cancellation===\nThe show was cancelled just before the third anniversary of its original air date. Most of the main characters were given happy endings.<ref>[http://www.tv.com/sunset-beach/episode-755/episode/469509/recap.html Final Episode Recap]</ref> Ben and Meg and Michael and Vanessa married in a double wedding. Casey and Sara got engaged, Cole and Caitlin were happy in their marriage, and Olivia was happily raising her children alone. Maria gave Ben a divorce so he could marry Meg and met a new man, Ross English. Maria also adopted Benjy, the little boy she had regarded as her own, and she and Ben planned to raise him together. The 'baddies' all got their comeuppances. Derek was accidentally shot and killed by Ben; his accomplice Tess went to jail, as did Gregory Richards (Francesca's real killer). Tim Truman, who though not a villain spent most of the three years causing problems for Ben and Meg, was murdered by Derek. Virginia remained in a mental hospital of the criminally insane, while reformed Annie also got a happy ending, finding love with relatively new character Jude.\n\nIn a twist ending, Meg appeared to wake up in [[Kansas]] and realize that the entire three years in Sunset Beach had been a dream \u2013 and the characters from the show were actually her friends and family in Kansas (a reference to ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'').{{Original research inline|date=August 2010}} However, at the last minute, Meg woke up in Sunset Beach and was in bed with Ben, the day after their wedding. Probably the dream was poking fun at how many writers use the sloppy ending of \"it was all a dream\" to bring a story to a close, as was done in stories such as ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'' or more aptly, evoking the dream (9th) season of the prime-time soap, ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]''.\n\nThe show gained a cult following in the UK, doing especially well in the ratings for [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]], with some universities holding ''Sunset Beach'' parties where students would go dressed as their favorite character. Channel 5 tried to save the show when its cancellation was announced, offering partially to fund it and trying to get other networks involved, as had happened previously with ''[[Baywatch]]'', but NBC was not interested. It did buy NBC's other soap opera, ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'', to air in ''Sunset Beach''\u2019s place, even running promos during ''Sunset Beach''\u2019s final week, but the show failed to catch on and Channel 5 dropped ''Days'' approximately a year later.\n\nTo date, ''Sunset Beach'' is the last regularly-scheduled NBC network program to air at 12:00&nbsp;p.m. Some NBC affiliates did not air ''Sunset Beach'' at its scheduled time due to the affiliates' longstanding practice of airing local newscasts or other syndicated programming in the noon hour; this resulted in some affiliates airing the show in a different spot on their schedule while others did not air it at all. In some media markets (especially in [[WKBD-TV|Detroit]] and [[KTXH|Houston]], where [[Post-Newsweek Stations]], the owner of [[WDIV-TV|WDIV]] and [[KPRC-TV]] at the time, preempted it for its entire run), ''Sunset Beach'' aired on affiliates of other networks or independent stations. In most markets that did air the show at its regular time, its second half-hour went up against the first half-hour of ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' on CBS and ''[[Port Charles]]'' on ABC. After the series ended, NBC returned the 12:00&nbsp;p.m. time slot to its affiliates.\n\n==International broadcasting==\n{{cleanup section|date=October 2011}}\n\nIn Australia, ''Sunset Beach'' aired on [[Network Ten]] from 1998 to 2000 in an early morning time slot.\n\nIn Bulgaria, ''Sunset Beach'' aired on [[Nova Television (Bulgaria)|Nova Television]] weekdays in 2001-2004 (all episodes), and on [[CBS Drama]] since January 2015.\n\nIn Canada, ''Sunset Beach'' aired at 3:00PM on independent station [[CHCH]] in Hamilton, Ontario; the show was broadcast the same day as NBC.<ref>{{Cite pressrelease|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970103004725/http://www.chch.com/press/current/sunset.htm |title=\"Sunset Beach\" a sizzling new daytime drama from Aaron Spelling, premieres January 6, 1997 on CHCH-TV |date=December 24, 1996 |archivedate=January 3, 1997 |accessdate=March 16, 2012 |publisher=Niagara Television Limited|url=http://www.chch.com/press/current/sunset.htm }}</ref>\n\nIn Croatia, ''Sunset Beach'' aired on [[Croatian radio television|HRT1]] (all episodes) weekdays at 6.30pm from September 1998 to May 2001.\n\nIn France, ''Sunset Beach'' aired on [[Fox life|TF1]].\n\nIn Ireland, ''Sunset Beach'' aired on [[TV3 (Ireland)|TV3]] weekdays at 2.30pm from 20 September 1998 to August 2001 - all 755 episodes aired.
