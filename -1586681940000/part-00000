Yankovic's first top ten ''[[Billboard charts|Billboard]]'' album (''[[Straight Outta Lynwood]]'') and single (\"[[White & Nerdy]]\") were both released in 2006, nearly three decades into his career. His latest album, ''[[Mandatory Fun]]'' (2014), became his first number-one album during its debut week.\n\nYankovic's success comes in part from his effective use of music video to further parody popular culture, the song's original artist, and the original music videos themselves, scene-for-scene in some cases. He directed later videos himself and went on to direct for other artists, including [[Ben Folds]], [[Hanson (band)|Hanson]], [[The Black Crowes]], and [[The Presidents of the United States of America (band)|The Presidents of the United States of America]]. With the decline of [[music television]] and the onset of [[social media]], Yankovic used [[YouTube]] and other video sites to publish his videos; this strategy proved integral, helping to boost sales of his later albums, including ''Mandatory Fun''. Yankovic has stated that he may forgo traditional albums in favor of timely releases of singles and EPs following on this success.\n\nIn addition to recording his albums, Yankovic wrote and starred in the film ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' (1989) and the television series ''[[The Weird Al Show]]'' (1997).

Yankovic had been called \"Weird Al\" originally as a more derogatory nickname from others within the dormitory he shared, as he was seen at the strange outcast compared to other residents.<Ref name=\"nytimes apr2020\"/> Though he initially took it as an insult, Yankovic eventually \"took it on professionally\" as his persona for the station.<ref name=\"booklet\"/> In 1978, he released his first recording (as Alfred Yankovic), \"Take Me Down\", on the LP, ''Slo Grown'', as a benefit for the Economic Opportunity Commission of [[San Luis Obispo County, California|San Luis Obispo County]]. The song mocked famous nearby landmarks such as [[Bubblegum Alley]] and the fountain toilets at the [[Madonna Inn]].\n\nIn mid-1979, shortly before his senior year, \"[[My Sharona]]\" by [[The Knack]] was on the charts and Yankovic took his accordion into the restroom across the hall from the radio station to take advantage of the [[echo chamber]] acoustics and recorded a parody titled \"[[My Bologna]]\".<ref name= takingoff/> He sent it to Dr. Demento, who played it to good response from listeners.  Yankovic met The Knack after a show at his college and introduced himself as the author of \"My Bologna\". The Knack's lead singer, [[Doug Fieger]], said he liked the song and suggested that [[Capitol Records]] vice president [[Rupert Perry]] release it as a single.<ref name=\"booklet\"/> \"My Bologna\" was released as a single with \"School Cafeteria\" as its B-side, and the label gave Yankovic a six-month recording contract.  Yankovic, who was \"only getting average grades\" in his architecture degree, began to realize that he might make a career of comedic music.<ref name=\"booklet\"/>\n\nOn September 14, 1980, Yankovic was a guest on the ''Dr. Demento Show'', where he was to record a new parody live. The song was called \"[[Another One Rides the Bus]]\", a parody of [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s hit, \"[[Another One Bites the Dust]]\". While practicing the song outside the sound booth, he met [[Jon Schwartz (drummer)|Jon \"Bermuda\" Schwartz]], who told him he was a drummer and agreed to bang on Yankovic's accordion case to help Yankovic keep a steady beat during the song. They rehearsed the song just a few times before the show began.<ref name=\"booklet\"/> \"Another One Rides the Bus\" became so popular that Yankovic's first television appearance was a performance of the song on ''[[Tomorrow (TV series)|The Tomorrow Show]]'' (April 21, 1981) with [[Tom Snyder]].<ref>{{cite document |title=TV Listings, Tuesday, April 21 |work=The Baltimore Sun |date=April 19, 1981 |page=TV24 |id={{ProQuest|535950110}} }}</ref> On the show, Yankovic played his accordion, and again, Schwartz banged on the accordion case and provided comical sound effects.

His stage act in a [[Phoenix, Arizona]], nightclub caught the eye of manager Jay Levey, who was \"blown away\".<ref name=\"booklet\"/> Levey asked Yankovic if he had considered creating a full band and doing his music as a career. Yankovic admitted that he had, so Levey held auditions. [[Steve Jay]] became Yankovic's bass player, and Jay's friend [[Jim West (guitarist)|Jim West]] played guitar. Schwartz continued on drums. Yankovic's first show with his new band was on March 31, 1982.<ref name=\"livepage\"/>  Several days later, Yankovic and his band were the opening act for [[Missing Persons (band)|Missing Persons]].\n\nYankovic recorded \"[[I Love Rocky Road]]\", (a parody of \"[[I Love Rock 'n' Roll]]\" originally recorded by [[Arrows (British band)|The Arrows]]) which was produced by [[Rick Derringer]], in 1982. The song was a hit on Top 40 radio, leading to Yankovic's signing with [[Scotti Brothers Records]]. In 1983, Yankovic's first [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic (album)|self-titled album]] was released on Scotti Bros. The song \"[[Ricky (song)|Ricky]]\" was released as a single and the music video received exposure on the still-young [[MTV]]. \"Ricky\" broke the top 100 videos on MTV at the time, which Yankovic took as a sign that his career was in music, quitting his job as a mailroom clerk at the local offices of [[Westwood One (1976-2011)|Westwood One]] to pursue the music career.<ref name=\"wapost feb2017\"/>\n\nYankovic released his second album ''[[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic in 3-D]]'' in 1984. The first single \"[[Eat It]]\", a parody of the [[Michael Jackson]] song \"[[Beat It]]\", became popular, thanks in part to the music video, a shot-for-shot parody of Jackson's \"Beat It\" music video, and what Yankovic described as his \"uncanny resemblance\" to Jackson. \"Eat It\" was also aided by the first of Yankovic's ''[[Al TV]]'' specials that aired on [[MTV]] on April 1, 1984, the network looking to Yankovic's rising popularity to help fill its programming time.<Ref name=\"nytimes apr2020\"/> Peaking at No.  12 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] on April 14, 1984,<ref>{{cite web |title=Eat It \u2013 Weird Al Yankovic |url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=weird al yankovic|chart=all}} |work=Billboard}}</ref> \"Eat It\" remained Yankovic's highest-charting single until \"[[White & Nerdy]]\" placed at No.  9 in October 2006.<ref>{{cite news |title=White & Nerdy |url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=weird al yankovic|chart=all}} |work=Billboard}}</ref>\n\nIn 1985, Yankovic co-wrote and starred in a [[mockumentary]] of his own life titled ''[[The Compleat Al]]'' (the title being a parody of the 1982 documentary ''[[The Compleat Beatles]]''), which intertwined the facts of his life up to that point with fiction. The movie also featured some clips from Yankovic's trip to Japan and some clips from the ''[[Al TV]]'' specials. ''The Compleat Al'' was co-directed by Jay Levey, who would direct ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' four years later.

He says that some songs have taken him weeks to compose the lyrics to as he permeates the various choices, sometimes entering a \"zombie phase\" as he mulls these over in his home. For example, Yankovic believes he could have written a completely different version of \"White & Nerdy\" based on the alternative choices of lyrics he had come up with and had discarded for the final song. He has also done significant research for other song parodies to get facts and keywords for certain areas of knowledge, such as for \"I Think I'm a Clone Now\" or hospitals for \"Like a Surgeon\".

A number of songs use the phrase \"internal organs\". Also, a [[hamster]] called [[Harvey the Wonder Hamster]] is a recurring character in ''[[The Weird Al Show]]'' and the ''Al TV'' specials, as well as the subject of an original song on ''[[Alapalooza]]''. Other recurring jokes include Yankovic borrowing, or being owed, $5. In a number of ''Al TV'' interviews, he often asks if he can borrow $5, being turned down every time. This motif also occurs in \"[[Poodle Hat|Why Does This Always Happen to Me?]]\", in which his deceased friend owes him $5. Another recurring joke is his attraction to female nostrils or nostrils in general. This also appears in numerous ''Al TV'' interviews as well as in several of his songs (\"[[Albuquerque (song)|Albuquerque]]\" and \"[[Poodle Hat|Wanna B Ur Lovr]]\" to name a few.) Yankovic also asks his celebrity guests if they could \"shave his back for a nickel.\" This also appears in the song \"[[Albuquerque (song)|Albuquerque]]\". Yankovic has also put two [[backmasking]] messages into his songs. The first, in \"Nature Trail to Hell\", said \"Satan Eats [[Cheez Whiz]]\"; the second, in \"I Remember Larry\", said \"Wow, you must have an awful lot of free time on your hands.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.al-oholicsanonymous.com/faq/#secret|title=Al-oholics Anonymous' Frequently Asked Questions|accessdate=August 24, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060829151229/http://www.al-oholicsanonymous.com/faq/| archivedate= August 29, 2006<!--Added by DASHBot-->}}</ref>\n\n=== Music videos ===\nWhile Yankovic's musical parodies generally do not include references to the songs or the artists of the original songs, Yankovic's music videos will sometimes parody the original song's music video in whole or in part.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/23/5926693/the-8-most-best-weird-al-parodies-video | title = The 8 best Weird Al parody videos | publisher = [[The Verge]] | date = July 23, 2014 | accessdate = July 25, 2014 }}</ref> Most notably, the video for \"[[Smells Like Nirvana]]\" uses an extremely similar set to [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s \"[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]\", including using several of the same actors.

[[Dr. Demento]] appeared in several of Yankovic's earlier videos, such as \"[[I Love Rocky Road]]\" and \"[[Ricky (song)|Ricky]]\". Actor [[Dick Van Patten]] is featured in both \"Smells Like Nirvana\" and \"[[Bedrock Anthem]]\"; [[Drew Carey]], [[Emo Philips]] and [[Phil LaMarr]] appeared in \"It's All About the Pentiums\"; [[Keegan-Michael Key]], [[Jordan Peele]], [[Donny Osmond]], [[Judy Tenuta]] and [[Seth Green]] appeared in \"White & Nerdy\"; and [[Ruth Buzzi]] and [[Pat Boone]] appeared in \"Gump\". The video for \"[[I Lost on Jeopardy]]\" includes an appearance by [[Greg Kihn]], the artist whose song, \"Jeopardy\", was being parodied, along with [[Don Pardo]] and [[Art Fleming]], Jeopardy's original announcer and host, as themselves. [[Florence Henderson]] plays an Amish seductress in \"Amish Paradise\".\n\nWhile most videos that Yankovic creates are aired on music channels such as MTV and [[VH1]], Yankovic worked with animation artists to create music videos for release with extended content albums. The [[DualDisc]] version of ''Straight Outta Lynwood'' features six videos set to songs from the release, including videos created by [[Bill Plympton]] and [[John Kricfalusi]]; one video, \"Weasel Stomping Day\" was created by the producers of the show ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', and aired as a segment of that program. For the 2010 ''Alpocalypse'', Yankovic produced videos for every song; four of those were previously released for each of the songs on the EP ''[[Internet Leaks]]'', with the videos for the remaining songs released via social media sites and included in the deluxe edition of ''Alpocalypse''. These live-action and animated videos were produced by both previous collaborators such as Plympton for \"TMZ\",<ref name=\"coedmag plympton\"/> video content providers like [[Jib-Jab]] and [[SuperNews!]], and other directors and animators.\n\nTo help promote his 2014 album ''Mandatory Fun'' in social media circles, Yankovic produced eight music videos for the album releasing them over eight consecutive days with release of the album, believing it \"would make an impact because people would be talking about the album all week long\".<ref name=\"foxnews 8days\">{{cite web | url = http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2014/07/18/weird-al-yankovic-adapint-to-digital-age/ | title = Weird Al Yankovic adapting to digital age | first = Ashley | last = Dvohrik | date = July 18, 2014 | accessdate = July 19, 2014 | publisher = [[Fox News]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = http://time.com/2949882/weird-al-yankovic-not-that-weird/ | title = The Al Yankovic Paradox: He Doesn't Seem That Weird Anymore | first = Lily | last = Rothman | date = July 2, 2014 | accessdate = July 2, 2014 | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] }}</ref> RCA Records opted not to fund production of any of these videos, and Yankovic turned to various social media portals including [[Funny or Die]] and [[CollegeHumor]] which he had worked with in the past; these sites helped to cover the production cost of the videos with Yankovic foregoing any ad video revenue.

It was designed to be part of CBS's mandated [[E/I|Educational or Informative]] programming to teach children morals. The show had a troubled production due to this requirement and the desire by CBS to follow in the success of ''[[Pee-wee's Playhouse]]'', leading to the show's cancellation after one 13-episode season.

His two commercial failures (his film ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' and his 1986 album ''[[Polka Party!]]'') were presented as having a larger impact on the direction of his career than they really had. Also, [[Coolio]]'s later disapproval of \"[[Amish Paradise]]\" was played up as a large feud.

DASHBot-->}}</ref> His works have earned him five [[Grammy Award]]s and a further eleven nominations, four [[RIAA certification|gold records]], and six [[RIAA certification|platinum records]] in the United States. Yankovic's first top ten ''[[Billboard charts|Billboard]]'' album (''[[Straight Outta Lynwood]]'') and single (\"[[White & Nerdy]]\") were both released in 2006, nearly three decades into his career. His latest album, ''[[Mandatory Fun]]'' (2014), became his first number-one album during its debut week.\n\nYankovic's success comes in part from his effective use of music video to further parody popular culture, the song's original artist, and the original music videos themselves, scene-for-scene in some cases. He directed later videos himself and went on to direct for other artists, including [[Ben Folds]], [[Hanson (band)|Hanson]], [[The Black Crowes]], and [[The Presidents of the United States of America (band)|The Presidents of the United States of America]]. With the decline of [[music television]] and the onset of [[social media]], Yankovic used [[YouTube]] and other video sites to publish his videos; this strategy proved integral, helping to boost sales of his later albums, including ''Mandatory Fun''. Yankovic has stated that he may forgo traditional albums in favor of timely releases of singles and EPs following on this success.\n\nIn addition to recording his albums, Yankovic wrote and starred in the film ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' (1989) and the television series ''[[The Weird Al Show]]'' (1997). He has also made guest appearances and performed voice acting roles on many television shows and video web content, in addition to starring in ''[[Al TV]]'' specials on [[MTV]].<ref name=allmusic>{{cite news|last=Ankeny |first=Jason |title=Weird Al Yankovic Biography |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/weird-al-yankovic-mn0000817315/biography |publisher=[[AllMusic.com]] ([[Rovi]]) |accessdate=July 24, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6aGZzJGWM?url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/weird-al-yankovic-mn0000817315/biography |archivedate=July 24, 2015 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref> He has also written two children's books, ''When I Grow Up'' and ''My New Teacher and Me!''\n\n== Early life ==\n{{external media | width = 210px | float = right | headerimage=[[File:\"Weird Al\" Yankovic.JPG|210px]] | video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LyNbCRQsck 'Weird Al' Yankovic \u2013 Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction?], 7:02, [[Diffuser.fm]]<ref name=\"forf\">{{cite web | title ='Weird Al' Yankovic Plays 'Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction?' | website = | publisher =[[Diffuser.fm]] | date = July 30, 2014 | url =http://diffuser.fm/weird-al-wikipedia-fact-or-fiction/ | accessdate =September 29, 2015 }}</ref> }}\n\nYankovic was born in [[Downey, California]] and raised in [[Lynwood, California]].

Yankovic had been called \"Weird Al\" originally as a more derogatory nickname from others within the dormitory he shared, as he was seen at the strange outcast compared to other residents.<Ref name=\"nytimes apr2020\"/> Though he initially took it as an insult, Yankovic eventually \"took it on professionally\" as his persona for the station.<ref name=\"booklet\"/> In 1978, he released his first recording (as Alfred Yankovic), \"Take Me Down\", on the LP, ''Slo Grown'', as a benefit for the Economic Opportunity Commission of [[San Luis Obispo County, California|San Luis Obispo County]]. The song mocked famous nearby landmarks such as [[Bubblegum Alley]] and the fountain toilets at the [[Madonna Inn]].\n\nIn mid-1979, shortly before his senior year, \"[[My Sharona]]\" by [[The Knack]] was on the charts and Yankovic took his accordion into the restroom across the hall from the radio station to take advantage of the [[echo chamber]] acoustics and recorded a parody titled \"[[My Bologna]]\".<ref name= takingoff/> He sent it to Dr. Demento, who played it to good response from listeners.  Yankovic met The Knack after a show at his college and introduced himself as the author of \"My Bologna\". The Knack's lead singer, [[Doug Fieger]], said he liked the song and suggested that [[Capitol Records]] vice president [[Rupert Perry]] release it as a single.<ref name=\"booklet\"/> \"My Bologna\" was released as a single with \"School Cafeteria\" as its B-side, and the label gave Yankovic a six-month recording contract.  Yankovic, who was \"only getting average grades\" in his architecture degree, began to realize that he might make a career of comedic music.<ref name=\"booklet\"/>\n\nOn September 14, 1980, Yankovic was a guest on the ''Dr. Demento Show'', where he was to record a new parody live. The song was called \"[[Another One Rides the Bus]]\", a parody of [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s hit, \"[[Another One Bites the Dust]]\". While practicing the song outside the sound booth, he met [[Jon Schwartz (drummer)|Jon \"Bermuda\" Schwartz]], who told him he was a drummer and agreed to bang on Yankovic's accordion case to help Yankovic keep a steady beat during the song. They rehearsed the song just a few times before the show began.<ref name=\"booklet\"/> \"Another One Rides the Bus\" became so popular that Yankovic's first television appearance was a performance of the song on ''[[Tomorrow (TV series)|The Tomorrow Show]]'' (April 21, 1981) with [[Tom Snyder]].<ref>{{cite document |title=TV Listings, Tuesday, April 21 |work=The Baltimore Sun |date=April 19, 1981 |page=TV24 |id={{ProQuest|535950110}} }}</ref> On the show, Yankovic played his accordion, and again, Schwartz banged on the accordion case and provided comical sound effects.

His stage act in a [[Phoenix, Arizona]], nightclub caught the eye of manager Jay Levey, who was \"blown away\".<ref name=\"booklet\"/> Levey asked Yankovic if he had considered creating a full band and doing his music as a career. Yankovic admitted that he had, so Levey held auditions. [[Steve Jay]] became Yankovic's bass player, and Jay's friend [[Jim West (guitarist)|Jim West]] played guitar. Schwartz continued on drums. Yankovic's first show with his new band was on March 31, 1982.<ref name=\"livepage\"/>  Several days later, Yankovic and his band were the opening act for [[Missing Persons (band)|Missing Persons]].\n\nYankovic recorded \"[[I Love Rocky Road]]\", (a parody of \"[[I Love Rock 'n' Roll]]\" originally recorded by [[Arrows (British band)|The Arrows]]) which was produced by [[Rick Derringer]], in 1982. The song was a hit on Top 40 radio, leading to Yankovic's signing with [[Scotti Brothers Records]]. In 1983, Yankovic's first [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic (album)|self-titled album]] was released on Scotti Bros. The song \"[[Ricky (song)|Ricky]]\" was released as a single and the music video received exposure on the still-young [[MTV]]. \"Ricky\" broke the top 100 videos on MTV at the time, which Yankovic took as a sign that his career was in music, quitting his job as a mailroom clerk at the local offices of [[Westwood One (1976-2011)|Westwood One]] to pursue the music career.<ref name=\"wapost feb2017\"/>\n\nYankovic released his second album ''[[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic in 3-D]]'' in 1984. The first single \"[[Eat It]]\", a parody of the [[Michael Jackson]] song \"[[Beat It]]\", became popular, thanks in part to the music video, a shot-for-shot parody of Jackson's \"Beat It\" music video, and what Yankovic described as his \"uncanny resemblance\" to Jackson. \"Eat It\" was also aided by the first of Yankovic's ''[[Al TV]]'' specials that aired on [[MTV]] on April 1, 1984, the network looking to Yankovic's rising popularity to help fill its programming time.<Ref name=\"nytimes apr2020\"/> Peaking at No.  12 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] on April 14, 1984,<ref>{{cite web |title=Eat It \u2013 Weird Al Yankovic |url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=weird al yankovic|chart=all}} |work=Billboard}}</ref> \"Eat It\" remained Yankovic's highest-charting single until \"[[White & Nerdy]]\" placed at No.  9 in October 2006.<ref>{{cite news |title=White & Nerdy |url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=weird al yankovic|chart=all}} |work=Billboard}}</ref>\n\nIn 1985, Yankovic co-wrote and starred in a [[mockumentary]] of his own life titled ''[[The Compleat Al]]'' (the title being a parody of the 1982 documentary ''[[The Compleat Beatles]]''), which intertwined the facts of his life up to that point with fiction. The movie also featured some clips from Yankovic's trip to Japan and some clips from the ''[[Al TV]]'' specials. ''The Compleat Al'' was co-directed by Jay Levey, who would direct ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' four years later.

Yankovic's parodies are often satirical of [[popular culture]], including television (''see [[The TV Album]]''), movies (\"[[The Saga Begins]]\"), and food (''see [[The Food Album]]'').

Madonna's friend was a mutual friend of Yankovic's manager, Jay Levey, and eventually Yankovic himself heard the story from Levey.<ref name=\"booklet\"/> In writing his parodies as well as his original songs, Yankovic spends a great deal of time in deciding the right words that not only match the beat of the original song but that fit theme of the parody. He says that some songs have taken him weeks to compose the lyrics to as he permeates the various choices, sometimes entering a \"zombie phase\" as he mulls these over in his home. For example, Yankovic believes he could have written a completely different version of \"White & Nerdy\" based on the alternative choices of lyrics he had come up with and had discarded for the final song. He has also done significant research for other song parodies to get facts and keywords for certain areas of knowledge, such as for \"I Think I'm a Clone Now\" or hospitals for \"Like a Surgeon\". Yankovic has documented all these past lyrical attempts, first through binders and then computerized in case he needs to go back for future songs. <ref name=\"nytimes apr2020\"/>\n\n===Polka medleys===\nMost of Yankovic's studio albums include a [[polka]] medley of about a dozen contemporary songs at the time of the album, with the choruses or memorable lines of various songs juxtaposed for humorous effect. In Yankovic's early career, before recording his first album, he had performed such polka medleys in live shows in California, though then using songs from lesser-known bands like [[Bad Brains]] and the [[Plasmatics]]. He had been inspired to do so from Spike Jones, who had transitioned classical music into polka.<ref name=\"avbook book excerpt\">{{cite web | url = https://www.avclub.com/exclusive-book-excerpt-weird-al-isnt-just-a-parody-mas-1819695905 | title = Exclusive book excerpt: Weird Al isn't just a parody master | first = Ray | last = Padgett | date = October 25, 2017 | accessdate = November 15, 2017 | work = [[The A.V.

He had originally just pulled the number 27 as a random figure to use in filling out lyrics, but as his fans started to notice the reuse of the number after the first few times, he began to purposely drop references to 27 within his lyrics, videos, and album covers.

A number of songs use the phrase \"internal organs\". Also, a [[hamster]] called [[Harvey the Wonder Hamster]] is a recurring character in ''[[The Weird Al Show]]'' and the ''Al TV'' specials, as well as the subject of an original song on ''[[Alapalooza]]''. Other recurring jokes include Yankovic borrowing, or being owed, $5. In a number of ''Al TV'' interviews, he often asks if he can borrow $5, being turned down every time. This motif also occurs in \"[[Poodle Hat|Why Does This Always Happen to Me?]]\", in which his deceased friend owes him $5. Another recurring joke is his attraction to female nostrils or nostrils in general. This also appears in numerous ''Al TV'' interviews as well as in several of his songs (\"[[Albuquerque (song)|Albuquerque]]\" and \"[[Poodle Hat|Wanna B Ur Lovr]]\" to name a few.) Yankovic also asks his celebrity guests if they could \"shave his back for a nickel.\" This also appears in the song \"[[Albuquerque (song)|Albuquerque]]\". Yankovic has also put two [[backmasking]] messages into his songs. The first, in \"Nature Trail to Hell\", said \"Satan Eats [[Cheez Whiz]]\"; the second, in \"I Remember Larry\", said \"Wow, you must have an awful lot of free time on your hands.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.al-oholicsanonymous.com/faq/#secret|title=Al-oholics Anonymous' Frequently Asked Questions|accessdate=August 24, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060829151229/http://www.al-oholicsanonymous.com/faq/| archivedate= August 29, 2006<!--Added by DASHBot-->}}</ref>\n\n=== Music videos ===\nWhile Yankovic's musical parodies generally do not include references to the songs or the artists of the original songs, Yankovic's music videos will sometimes parody the original song's music video in whole or in part.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/23/5926693/the-8-most-best-weird-al-parodies-video | title = The 8 best Weird Al parody videos | publisher = [[The Verge]] | date = July 23, 2014 | accessdate = July 25, 2014 }}</ref> Most notably, the video for \"[[Smells Like Nirvana]]\" uses an extremely similar set to [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s \"[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]\", including using several of the same actors.

[[Dr. Demento]] appeared in several of Yankovic's earlier videos, such as \"[[I Love Rocky Road]]\" and \"[[Ricky (song)|Ricky]]\". Actor [[Dick Van Patten]] is featured in both \"Smells Like Nirvana\" and \"[[Bedrock Anthem]]\"; [[Drew Carey]], [[Emo Philips]] and [[Phil LaMarr]] appeared in \"It's All About the Pentiums\"; [[Keegan-Michael Key]], [[Jordan Peele]], [[Donny Osmond]], [[Judy Tenuta]] and [[Seth Green]] appeared in \"White & Nerdy\"; and [[Ruth Buzzi]] and [[Pat Boone]] appeared in \"Gump\". The video for \"[[I Lost on Jeopardy]]\" includes an appearance by [[Greg Kihn]], the artist whose song, \"Jeopardy\", was being parodied, along with [[Don Pardo]] and [[Art Fleming]], Jeopardy's original announcer and host, as themselves. [[Florence Henderson]] plays an Amish seductress in \"Amish Paradise\".\n\nWhile most videos that Yankovic creates are aired on music channels such as MTV and [[VH1]], Yankovic worked with animation artists to create music videos for release with extended content albums. The [[DualDisc]] version of ''Straight Outta Lynwood'' features six videos set to songs from the release, including videos created by [[Bill Plympton]] and [[John Kricfalusi]]; one video, \"Weasel Stomping Day\" was created by the producers of the show ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', and aired as a segment of that program. For the 2010 ''Alpocalypse'', Yankovic produced videos for every song; four of those were previously released for each of the songs on the EP ''[[Internet Leaks]]'', with the videos for the remaining songs released via social media sites and included in the deluxe edition of ''Alpocalypse''. These live-action and animated videos were produced by both previous collaborators such as Plympton for \"TMZ\",<ref name=\"coedmag plympton\"/> video content providers like [[Jib-Jab]] and [[SuperNews!]], and other directors and animators.\n\nTo help promote his 2014 album ''Mandatory Fun'' in social media circles, Yankovic produced eight music videos for the album releasing them over eight consecutive days with release of the album, believing it \"would make an impact because people would be talking about the album all week long\".<ref name=\"foxnews 8days\">{{cite web | url = http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2014/07/18/weird-al-yankovic-adapint-to-digital-age/ | title = Weird Al Yankovic adapting to digital age | first = Ashley | last = Dvohrik | date = July 18, 2014 | accessdate = July 19, 2014 | publisher = [[Fox News]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = http://time.com/2949882/weird-al-yankovic-not-that-weird/ | title = The Al Yankovic Paradox: He Doesn't Seem That Weird Anymore | first = Lily | last = Rothman | date = July 2, 2014 | accessdate = July 2, 2014 | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] }}</ref> RCA Records opted not to fund production of any of these videos, and Yankovic turned to various social media portals including [[Funny or Die]] and [[CollegeHumor]] which he had worked with in the past; these sites helped to cover the production cost of the videos with Yankovic foregoing any ad video revenue.

The show had a troubled production due to this requirement and the desire by CBS to follow in the success of ''[[Pee-wee's Playhouse]]'', leading to the show's cancellation after one 13-episode season.

Also, [[Coolio]]'s later disapproval of \"[[Amish Paradise]]\" was played up as a large feud. Much was also made over his apparent lack of a love life, though he got married shortly after the program aired. The episode was updated and re-released in early 2012 as part of the \"Behind the Music Remastered\" series.\n\nYankovic performed at the [[66th Primetime Emmy Awards]] singing a comedic medley of songs based on the themes of several Emmy-nominated shows such as ''[[Mad Men]]'' and ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.vulture.com/2014/08/watch-weird-al-emmys-tv-theme-song-medley.html | title = Watch Weird Al's Emmys TV Theme-Song Medley | first = Gilbert | last = Cruz | date = August 25, 2014 | accessdate=  August 25, 2014 | work = [[Vulture (blog)|Vulture]] }}</ref>\n\n=== Animation and voice work ===\nYankovic has done voice-overs for several animated series.

The Dali Lama was interested in whether the brain impacts the mind or if it might be the other way around. Mayberg pointed out the impact of DBS on severely depressed individuals. Their informal hypothesis was that, based on experiments that examined brain behavior from people practicing meditation, and experiments involving DBS, it was likely that meditation could improve brain waves that are important to mental health \u2014 yet when a patient experiences a certain degree of depression, it takes biological treatment to restore the patient to where they can meditate at all.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/buddhists-meet-mind-scientists-conference-meditation-and-depression|title=Buddhists Meet Mind Scientists in Conference on Meditation and Depression|last=Charles L.

The rebuttal is that severely depressed individuals often have lost a sense of self and that invasive procedures can block the barrier that might be the root cause of the loss of self, thereby restoring it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfn.org/sitecore/content/Home/OMP/Articles/Professional-Development/2016/When-It-Comes-to-Issues-of-Identity-and-Authenticity-in-DBS-Let-Patients-Have-a-Voice|title=When It Comes to Issues of Identity and Authenticity in DBS, Let Patients Have a Voice|website=www.sfn.org|access-date=2019-12-11}}</ref>\n\nMayberg gave a presentation in 2014 at the [[Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues]], where she expressed her clinical and experiential lessons in [[neuroethics]]. Her commentary focused on how severely depressed patients are rarely irrational, and that there needs to be open communication and a two-way understanding of expectations. She also asserted in publications that DBS patients should have their own words reflected in the medical literature.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bioethicsarchive.georgetown.edu/pcsbi/node/4004.html|title=Transcript, Meeting 18, Session 3 {{!}} Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues|website=bioethicsarchive.georgetown.edu|access-date=2019-12-11}}</ref>\n\n===== Neurolaw =====\n[[Neurolaw]], related to [[Neurocriminology]], is based on the concept that MRI and PET scans as well as other means of examining of a person\u2019s brain composition, can be used to hold harmless an alleged perpetrator in a court of law. Or, conversely, to justify a conviction. [[Adrian Raine]] was among those who postulated this theory in the 1980s, and it gained attention in the press after the trial and conviction of [[John Hinckley Jr.]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-neurolaw-coming-soon-to-a-courtroom-near-you/|title=Is \"Neurolaw\" Coming Soon to a Courtroom Near You?|last=Magazine|first=Eryn Brown,Knowable|website=Scientific American|language=en|access-date=2019-12-11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/11/magazine/11Neurolaw.t.html|title=Neuroscience - Law - The Brain on the Stand - Jeffrey Rosen|last=Rosen|first=Jeffrey|date=2007-03-11|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-12-11|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nOther scholars, including Mayberg, have argued in editorials and interviews that science of the brain cannot be used, at least at this point, to offer evidence for a conviction.

The Dali Lama was interested in whether the brain impacts the mind or if it might be the other way around. Mayberg pointed out the impact of DBS on severely depressed individuals. Their informal hypothesis was that, based on experiments that examined brain behavior from people practicing meditation, and experiments involving DBS, it was likely that meditation could improve brain waves that are important to mental health \u2014 yet when a patient experiences a certain degree of depression, it takes biological treatment to restore the patient to where they can meditate at all.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/buddhists-meet-mind-scientists-conference-meditation-and-depression|title=Buddhists Meet Mind Scientists in Conference on Meditation and Depression|last=Charles L.

The rebuttal is that severely depressed individuals often have lost a sense of self and that invasive procedures can block the barrier that might be the root cause of the loss of self, thereby restoring it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfn.org/sitecore/content/Home/OMP/Articles/Professional-Development/2016/When-It-Comes-to-Issues-of-Identity-and-Authenticity-in-DBS-Let-Patients-Have-a-Voice|title=When It Comes to Issues of Identity and Authenticity in DBS, Let Patients Have a Voice|website=www.sfn.org|access-date=2019-12-11}}</ref>\n\nMayberg gave a presentation in 2014 at the [[Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues]], where she expressed her clinical and experiential lessons in [[neuroethics]]. Her commentary focused on how severely depressed patients are rarely irrational, and that there needs to be open communication and a two-way understanding of expectations. She also asserted in publications that DBS patients should have their own words reflected in the medical literature.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bioethicsarchive.georgetown.edu/pcsbi/node/4004.html|title=Transcript, Meeting 18, Session 3 {{!}} Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues|website=bioethicsarchive.georgetown.edu|access-date=2019-12-11}}</ref>\n\n===== Neurolaw =====\n[[Neurolaw]], related to [[Neurocriminology]], is based on the concept that MRI and PET scans as well as other means of examining of a person\u2019s brain composition, can be used to hold harmless an alleged perpetrator in a court of law. Or, conversely, to justify a conviction.
