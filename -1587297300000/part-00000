An [[aircraft]] flying through such a cloud sees an abrupt crystallization of these droplets, which can result in the formation of ice on the aircraft's wings or blockage of its instruments and probes, unless the aircraft is equipped with an appropriate [[de-icing]] system. [[Freezing rain]] is also caused by supercooled droplets.\n\nThe process opposite to supercooling, the melting of a solid above the freezing point, is much more difficult, and a solid will almost always melt at the same [[temperature]] for a given [[pressure]]. For this reason, it is the melting point which is usually identified, using [[melting point apparatus]]; even when the subject of a paper is \"freezing-point determination\", the actual methodology is \"the principle of observing the disappearance rather than the formation of ice\".<ref>\"[http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/26/1/57.pdf A new method of freezing-point determination for small quantities]\", J.

Supercooling is the cooling of a liquid below its freezing point without it becoming solid.  Freezing point depression is when a [[solution]] can be cooled below the freezing point of the corresponding pure liquid due to the presence of the [[Solution|solute]]; an example of this is the freezing point depression that occurs when [[salt]] is added to pure water.\n\n==Constitutional supercooling==\n[[File:Constitutional supercooling - phase diagram, concentration, and temperature.png|thumb|Constitutional supercooling \u2013 phase diagram, concentration, and temperature]]\n\nConstitutional supercooling, which occurs during solidification, is due to compositional solid changes, and results in cooling a liquid below the freezing point ahead of the [[solid\u2013liquid interface]].  When solidifying a liquid, the interface is often unstable, and the velocity of the solid\u2013liquid interface must be small in order to avoid constitutional supercooling.\n\nSupercooled zones are observed when the [[liquidus]] temperature gradient at the interface is larger than the temperature gradient.\n\n: <math>\\left.\\frac{\\partial T_L}{\\partial x}\\right|_{x=0} > \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}</math>\n\nor\n\n: <math>m \\left.\\frac{\\partial C_L}{\\partial x}\\right|_{x=0} > \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}</math>\n\nThe slope of the liquidus phase boundary on the phase diagram is <math>m = \\partial T_L / \\partial C_L</math>\n\nThe concentration gradient is related to points, <math>C^{LS}</math> and <math>C^{SL}</math>, on the phase diagram:\n\n: <math>\\left.\\frac{\\partial C_L}{\\partial x}\\right|_{x=0} = - \\frac{C^{LS} - C^{SL}}{D/v}</math>\n\nFor steady-state growth <math>C^{SL}=C_0</math> and the partition function <math>k=\\frac{C^{SL}}{C^{LS}}</math> can be assumed to be constant.

There are many techniques that aid in maintaining a liquid state, such as the production of [[antifreeze protein]]s, or AFPs, which bind to ice crystals to prevent water molecules from binding and spreading the growth of ice.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal |author=J.G.

Fish that rely on supercooling for survival must also live well below the water surface, because if they came into contact with ice nuclei they would freeze immediately. Animals that undergo supercooling to survive must also remove ice-nucleating agents from their bodies because they act as a starting point for freezing. Supercooling is also a common feature in some insect, reptile, and other [[ectotherm]] species. The potato cyst nematode larva [[Globodera_rostochiensis|(''Globodera rostochiensis'')]] could survive inside their cysts in a supercooled state to temperatures as low as {{convert|-38|C}}, even with the cyst encased in ice.\n\nSupercooling is a last resort for animals. The best option is to move to a warmer environment if possible. As an animal gets farther and farther below its original freezing point the chance of spontaneous freezing increases dramatically for its internal fluids, as this is a thermodynamically unstable state. The fluids eventually reach the supercooling point, which is the temperature at which the supercooled solution freezes spontaneously due to being so far below its normal freezing point.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=C.H.

An [[aircraft]] flying through such a cloud sees an abrupt crystallization of these droplets, which can result in the formation of ice on the aircraft's wings or blockage of its instruments and probes, unless the aircraft is equipped with an appropriate [[de-icing]] system. [[Freezing rain]] is also caused by supercooled droplets.\n\nThe process opposite to supercooling, the melting of a solid above the freezing point, is much more difficult, and a solid will almost always melt at the same [[temperature]] for a given [[pressure]]. For this reason, it is the melting point which is usually identified, using [[melting point apparatus]]; even when the subject of a paper is \"freezing-point determination\", the actual methodology is \"the principle of observing the disappearance rather than the formation of ice\".<ref>\"[http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/26/1/57.pdf A new method of freezing-point determination for small quantities]\", J. A. Ramsay, ''[[J. Exp.

Supercooling is the cooling of a liquid below its freezing point without it becoming solid.  Freezing point depression is when a [[solution]] can be cooled below the freezing point of the corresponding pure liquid due to the presence of the [[Solution|solute]]; an example of this is the freezing point depression that occurs when [[salt]] is added to pure water.\n\n== Constitutional supercooling ==\n[[File:Constitutional supercooling - phase diagram, concentration, and temperature.png|thumb|Constitutional supercooling \u2013 phase diagram, concentration, and temperature]]\n\nConstitutional supercooling, which occurs during solidification, is due to compositional solid changes, and results in cooling a liquid below the freezing point ahead of the [[solid\u2013liquid interface]].  When solidifying a liquid, the interface is often unstable, and the velocity of the solid\u2013liquid interface must be small in order to avoid constitutional supercooling.\n\nSupercooled zones are observed when the [[liquidus]] temperature gradient at the interface is larger than the temperature gradient.\n\n: <math>\\left.\\frac{\\partial T_L}{\\partial x}\\right|_{x=0} > \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}</math>\n\nor\n\n: <math>m \\left.\\frac{\\partial C_L}{\\partial x}\\right|_{x=0} > \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}</math>\n\nThe slope of the liquidus phase boundary on the phase diagram is <math>m = \\partial T_L / \\partial C_L</math>\n\nThe concentration gradient is related to points, <math>C^{LS}</math> and <math>C^{SL}</math>, on the phase diagram:\n\n: <math>\\left.\\frac{\\partial C_L}{\\partial x}\\right|_{x=0} = - \\frac{C^{LS} - C^{SL}}{D/v}</math>\n\nFor steady-state growth <math>C^{SL}=C_0</math> and the partition function <math>k=\\frac{C^{SL}}{C^{LS}}</math> can be assumed to be constant.

There are many techniques that aid in maintaining a liquid state, such as the production of [[antifreeze protein]]s, or AFPs, which bind to ice crystals to prevent water molecules from binding and spreading the growth of ice.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal |author=J.G.

Fish that rely on supercooling for survival must also live well below the water surface, because if they came into contact with ice nuclei they would freeze immediately. Animals that undergo supercooling to survive must also remove ice-nucleating agents from their bodies because they act as a starting point for freezing. Supercooling is also a common feature in some insect, reptile, and other [[ectotherm]] species. The potato cyst nematode larva [[Globodera_rostochiensis|(''Globodera rostochiensis'')]] could survive inside their cysts in a supercooled state to temperatures as low as {{convert|-38|C}}, even with the cyst encased in ice.\n\nSupercooling is a last resort for animals. The best option is to move to a warmer environment if possible. As an animal gets farther and farther below its original freezing point the chance of spontaneous freezing increases dramatically for its internal fluids, as this is a thermodynamically unstable state. The fluids eventually reach the supercooling point, which is the temperature at which the supercooled solution freezes spontaneously due to being so far below its normal freezing point.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=C.H.

After a series of 3 trial matches on 27 June both the New Zealand team and Auckland teams were selected. Officials had declared that \"give us fine weather and we will get an attendance of 20,000\". Unfortunately the weather did not oblige and it was in fact described as \"the worst experienced this season ... in one place there was a miniature lake.\" This resulted in a crowd many times smaller, however thousands came into the ground to watch the main match between North Island and South Island, won by the former 27 points to 9.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =The Minor Trial Games/A Win for South Auckland/Play Marred by the Rain\n| page =12 \n| work= [[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume=LXII |issue=19056\n| date = 1925-06-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250629.2.140.4\n| accessdate = 2019-09-12}}</ref> Auckland then played against the [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] team and lost 9 points to 16. Following this they played a Northern Union Challenge Cup match against the holders South Auckland and were victorious by 24 points to 16. After the New Zealand team returned from their tour of [[Australia]] they again played Auckland at [[Carlaw Park]] and they used the experience they had gained to trounce Auckland by 41 points to 17, employing tactics that the Auckland team were not prepared for. Two weeks later Auckland played [[Queensland rugby league team|Queensland]] who were being touted as the finest league team in the world at the time in the first of three matches. They drew the first, before narrowly losing the second and then being well and truly outclassed in the 3rd match by 54 points to 14.\n\n===Representative Fixtures===\nAfter the trial matches were played the New Zealand team was selected by Mr Liversedge, Pearce, and Harding, and 14 Auckland players made the side. They were: C. Dufty, P. Gregory, Lou Brown, A. Brisbane, F. Delgrosso, J. Kirwan, B. Laing, M. Wetherill, W. Wilson-Hall, C. Webb, B. Avery, E. Herring, J. O'Brien, and H. Dixon.

After a series of 3 trial matches on 27 June both the New Zealand team and Auckland teams were selected. Officials had declared that \"give us fine weather and we will get an attendance of 20,000\". Unfortunately the weather did not oblige and it was in fact described as \"the worst experienced this season ... in one place there was a miniature lake.\" This resulted in a crowd many times smaller, however thousands came into the ground to watch the main match between North Island and South Island, won by the former 27 points to 9.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =The Minor Trial Games/A Win for South Auckland/Play Marred by the Rain\n| page =12 \n| work= [[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume=LXII |issue=19056\n| date = 1925-06-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250629.2.140.4\n| accessdate = 2019-09-12}}</ref> Auckland then played against the [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] team and lost 9 points to 16. Following this they played a Northern Union Challenge Cup match against the holders South Auckland and were victorious by 24 points to 16. After the New Zealand team returned from their tour of [[Australia]] they again played Auckland at [[Carlaw Park]] and they used the experience they had gained to trounce Auckland by 41 points to 17, employing tactics that the Auckland team were not prepared for. Two weeks later Auckland played [[Queensland rugby league team|Queensland]] who were being touted as the finest league team in the world at the time in the first of three matches. They drew the first, before narrowly losing the second and then being well and truly outclassed in the 3rd match by 54 points to 14.\n\n===Representative Fixtures===\nAfter the trial matches were played the New Zealand team was selected by Mr Liversedge, Pearce, and Harding, and 14 Auckland players made the side. They were: C. Dufty, P. Gregory, Lou Brown, A. Brisbane, F. Delgrosso, J. Kirwan, B. Laing, M. Wetherill, W. Wilson-Hall, C. Webb, B. Avery, E. Herring, J. O'Brien, and H. Dixon.

In either case, the processor(s) used may be types ranging from general purpose to those specialized in a certain class of computations, or even custom designed for the application at hand. A common standard class of dedicated processors is the [[digital signal processor]] (DSP).\n\nSince the embedded system is dedicated to specific tasks, [[design engineer]]s can optimize it to reduce the size and cost of the product and increase the reliability and performance. Some embedded systems are mass-produced, benefiting from [[economies of scale]].\n\nEmbedded systems range from portable devices such as [[digital watch]]es and [[MP3 player]]s, to large stationary installations like [[Traffic light control and coordination|traffic light controllers]], [[programmable logic controller]]s, and large complex systems like [[hybrid vehicles]], [[medical imaging]] systems, and [[avionics]]. Complexity varies from low, with a single microcontroller chip, to very high with multiple units, [[peripheral]]s and networks mounted inside a large [[equipment rack]].\n\n==History==\n=== Background ===\n{{See also|Microprocessor chronology}}\n\nThe origins of the [[microprocessor]] and the [[microcontroller]] can be traced back to the [[MOS integrated circuit]], which is an [[integrated circuit]] chip [[semiconductor device fabrication|fabricated]] from [[MOSFET]]s (metal-oxide-semiconductor [[field-effect transistor]]s) and was developed in the early 1960s. By 1964, MOS chips had reached higher [[transistor density]] and lower manufacturing costs than [[bipolar junction transistor|bipolar]] chips. MOS chips further increased in complexity at a rate predicted by [[Moore's law]], leading to [[large-scale integration]] (LSI) with hundreds of [[transistors]] on a single MOS chip by the late 1960s. The application of MOS LSI chips to [[computing]] was the basis for the first microprocessors, as engineers began recognizing that a complete [[computer processor]] system could be contained on several MOS LSI chips.<ref name=\"ieee\">{{cite journal |last1=Shirriff |first1=Ken |title=The Surprising Story of the First Microprocessors |journal=[[IEEE Spectrum]] |volume=53 |issue=9 |pages=48\u201354 |date=30 August 2016 |publisher=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] |url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-history/silicon-revolution/the-surprising-story-of-the-first-microprocessors |accessdate=13 October 2019|doi=10.1109/MSPEC.2016.7551353 }}</ref>\n\nThe first multi-chip microprocessors, the [[Four-Phase Systems AL1]] in 1969 and the [[Garrett AiResearch]] [[MP944]] in 1970, were developed with multiple MOS LSI chips. The first single-chip microprocessor was the [[Intel 4004]], released in 1971. It was developed by [[Federico Faggin]], using his [[silicon-gate]] MOS technology, along with [[Intel]] engineers [[Marcian Hoff]] and [[Stan Mazor]], and [[Busicom]] engineer [[Masatoshi Shima]].<ref>{{cite web |title=1971: Microprocessor Integrates CPU Function onto a Single Chip |website=The Silicon Engine |url=https://www.computerhistory.org/siliconengine/microprocessor-integrates-cpu-function-onto-a-single-chip/ |publisher=[[Computer History Museum]] |accessdate=22 July 2019}}</ref><!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\n=== Development ===\nOne of the very first recognizably modern embedded systems was the [[Apollo Guidance Computer]],{{citation needed|reason=linked article claims it is the first IC-based computer. nothing there supports it being the first embedded system.|date=August 2018}} developed ca. 1965 by [[Charles Stark Draper]] at the [[MIT Instrumentation Laboratory]]. At the project's inception, the Apollo guidance computer was considered the riskiest item in the Apollo project as it employed the then newly developed [[monolithic integrated circuit]]s to reduce the size and weight. \n\nAn early mass-produced embedded system was the [[D-17B|Autonetics D-17 guidance computer]] for the [[Minuteman (missile)|Minuteman missile]], released in 1961. When the Minuteman II went into production in 1966, the D-17 was replaced with a new computer that was the first high-volume use of integrated circuits.\n\nSince these early applications in the 1960s, embedded systems have come down in price and there has been a dramatic rise in processing power and functionality. An early [[microprocessor]], the [[Intel 4004]] (released in 1971), was designed for [[calculator]]s and other small systems but still required external memory and support chips. By the early 1980s, memory, input and output system components had been integrated into the same chip as the processor forming a [[microcontroller]]. As the cost of microprocessors and microcontrollers fell it became feasible to replace expensive knob-based [[Analogue electronics|analog]] components such as [[potentiometer]]s and [[variable capacitor]]s with up/down buttons or knobs read out by a microprocessor even in consumer products. Microcontrollers find applications where a general-purpose computer would be too costly.\n\nToday, a comparatively low-cost microcontroller may be programmed to fulfill the same role as a large number of separate components. Although in this context an embedded system is usually more complex than a traditional solution, most of the complexity is contained within the microcontroller itself. Very few additional components may be needed and most of the design effort is in the software. Software prototype and test can be quicker compared with the design and construction of a new circuit not using an embedded processor.\n\n==Applications==\n[[File:Accupoll-embedded-computer.jpg|thumb|Embedded Computer Sub-Assembly for Accupoll Electronic Voting Machine<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/|title=Electronic Frontier Foundation|website=Electronic Frontier Foundation}}</ref>]]\n\nEmbedded systems are commonly found in consumer, industrial, [[Automotive industry|automotive]], [[home appliance]]s, medical, commercial and military applications.\n\n[[Telecommunication]]s systems employ numerous embedded systems from [[telephone switch]]es for the network to [[Mobile phone|cell phones]] at the [[end user]].\nComputer networking uses dedicated [[Router (computing)|routers]] and [[network bridge]]s to route data.\n\n[[Consumer electronics]] include [[MP3 player]]s, mobile phones, [[video game console]]s, [[digital camera]]s, [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] receivers, and [[computer printer|printers]].\nHousehold appliances, such as [[microwave oven]]s, [[washing machine]]s and [[dishwashers]], include embedded systems to provide flexibility, efficiency and features. Advanced [[HVAC]] systems use networked [[thermostat]]s to more accurately and efficiently control temperature that can change by time of day and [[season]]. [[Home automation]] uses wired- and wireless-networking that can be used to control lights, climate, security, audio/visual, surveillance, etc., all of which use embedded devices for sensing and controlling.\n\nTransportation systems from flight to automobiles increasingly use embedded systems.\nNew airplanes contain advanced [[avionics]] such as [[inertial guidance system]]s and [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] receivers that also have considerable safety requirements.\nVarious electric motors \u2014 [[brushless DC motor]]s, [[induction motor]]s and [[DC motor]]s \u2014 use electric/electronic [[motor controller]]s.\n[[Automobile]]s, [[electric vehicle]]s, and [[hybrid vehicle]]s increasingly use embedded systems to maximize efficiency and reduce pollution.\nOther automotive safety systems include [[anti-lock braking system]] (ABS), [[Electronic Stability Control]] (ESC/ESP), [[Traction control system|traction control]] (TCS) and automatic [[four-wheel drive]].\n\n[[Medical equipment]] uses embedded systems for [[vital signs]] monitoring, [[electronic stethoscope]]s for amplifying sounds, and various [[medical imaging]] ([[Positron emission tomography|PET]], [[Single photon emission computed tomography|SPECT]], [[Computed tomography|CT]], and [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]]) for non-invasive internal inspections. Embedded systems within medical equipment are often powered by industrial computers.<ref>[http://content.dell.com/us/en/enterprise/oem-industry-solutions-build-your-product-with-dell Embedded Systems Dell OEM Solutions | Dell].

In dealing with security, the embedded systems can be self-sufficient and be able to deal with cut electrical and communication systems.\n\nA new class of miniature wireless devices called [[mote (sensor)|motes]] are networked wireless sensors. Wireless sensor networking, [[WSN]], makes use of miniaturization made possible by advanced IC design to couple full wireless subsystems to sophisticated sensors, enabling people and companies to measure a myriad of things in the physical world and act on this information through IT monitoring and control systems. These motes are completely self-contained, and will typically run off a battery source for years before the batteries need to be changed or charged.\n\nEmbedded Wi-Fi modules provide a simple means of wirelessly enabling any device that communicates via a serial port.\n\n==Characteristics==\nEmbedded systems are designed to do some specific task, rather than be a general-purpose computer for multiple tasks. Some also have [[Real-time computing|real-time]] performance constraints that must be met, for reasons such as safety and usability; others may have low or no performance requirements, allowing the system hardware to be simplified to reduce costs.\n\nEmbedded systems are not always standalone devices. Many embedded systems consist of small parts within a larger device that serves a more general purpose. For example, the [[Gibson Robot Guitar]] features an embedded system for tuning the strings, but the overall purpose of the Robot Guitar is, of course, to play music.<ref>[http://www.embedded.com/underthehood/207401418 Embedded.com \u2013 Under the Hood: Robot Guitar embeds autotuning] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708195311/http://embedded.com/underthehood/207401418 |date=2008-07-08 }} By David Carey, TechOnline EE Times (04/22/08, 11:10:00 AM EDT)Embedded Systems Design \u2013 Embedded.com</ref> Similarly, an embedded system in an [[automobile]] provides a specific function as a subsystem of the car itself.\n\n[[File:ESOM270 eSOM300 Computer on Modules.jpg|thumb|e-con Systems eSOM270 & eSOM300 Computer on Modules]]\nThe program instructions written for embedded systems are referred to as [[firmware]], and are stored in read-only memory or [[flash memory]] chips. They run with limited computer hardware resources: little memory, small or non-existent keyboard or screen.\n\n===User interface===\n[[File:MicroVGA TUI demoapp.jpg|thumb|Embedded system [[text user interface]] using MicroVGA<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"MicroVGA\">For more details of MicroVGA see this [http://www.microvga.com/pdf/uvga-text-ds.pdf PDF].</ref>]]\n\nEmbedded systems range from [[Headless system|no user interface]] at all, in systems dedicated only to one task, to complex [[Desktop operating system#Graphical user interfaces|graphical user interfaces]] that resemble modern computer desktop operating systems.\nSimple embedded devices use [[Push-button|buttons]], [[LED]]s, graphic or character [[LCD]]s ([[Hitachi HD44780 LCD controller|HD44780 LCD]] for example) with a simple [[menu (computing)|menu system]].\n\nMore sophisticated devices that use a graphical screen with [[touch screen|touch]] sensing or screen-edge buttons provide flexibility while minimizing space used: the meaning of the buttons can change with the screen, and selection involves the natural behavior of pointing at what is desired. [[Mobile device|Handheld systems]] often have a screen with a \"joystick button\" for a pointing device.\n\nSome systems provide user interface remotely with the help of a serial (e.g. [[RS-232]], [[USB]], [[I\u00b2C]], etc.) or network (e.g. [[Ethernet]]) connection. This approach gives several advantages: extends the capabilities of embedded system, avoids the cost of a display, simplifies [[Board support package|BSP]] and allows one to build a rich user interface on the PC. A good example of this is the combination of an [[Embedded HTTP server|embedded web server]] running on an embedded device (such as an [[IP camera]]) or a [[Router (computing)|network router]]. The user interface is displayed in a [[web browser]] on a PC connected to the device, therefore needing no software to be installed.\n\n===Processors in embedded systems===\nExamples of properties of typical embedded computers, when compared with general-purpose counterparts, are low power consumption, small size, rugged operating ranges, and low per-unit cost. This comes at the price of limited processing resources, which make them significantly more difficult to program and to interact with. However, by building intelligence mechanisms on top of the hardware, taking advantage of possible existing sensors and the existence of a network of embedded units, one can both optimally manage available resources at the unit and network levels as well as provide augmented functions, well beyond those available.<ref name=\"Alippi2014\">C.Alippi: ''Intelligence for Embedded Systems.'' Springer, 2014, 283pp, {{ISBN|978-3-319-05278-6}}.</ref> For example, intelligent techniques can be designed to manage power consumption of embedded systems.<ref>S. Mittal, \"[https://www.academia.edu/4186102/A_survey_of_techniques_for_improving_energy_efficiency_in_embedded_computing_systems A survey of techniques for improving energy efficiency in embedded computing systems]\", IJCAET, 6(4), 440\u2013459, 2014.</ref>\n\nEmbedded processors can be broken into two broad categories. Ordinary microprocessors (\u03bcP) use separate integrated circuits for memory and peripherals. Microcontrollers (\u03bcC) have on-chip peripherals, thus reducing power consumption, size and cost. In contrast to the personal computer market, many different basic [[CPU architecture]]s are used since the software is custom-developed for an application and is not a commodity product installed by the end user. Both [[Von Neumann architecture|Von Neumann]] as well as various degrees of [[Harvard architecture]]s are used. [[RISC]] as well as non-RISC processors are found. Word lengths vary from 4-bit to 64-bits and beyond, although the most typical remain 8/16-bit. Most architectures come in a large number of different variants and shapes, many of which are also manufactured by several different companies.\n\n[[List of common microcontrollers|Numerous microcontrollers]] have been developed for embedded systems use. General-purpose microprocessors are also used in embedded systems, but generally, require more support circuitry than microcontrollers.\n\n====Ready-made computer boards====\n[[PC/104]] and PC/104+ are examples of standards for ''ready-made'' computer boards intended for small, low-volume embedded and ruggedized systems, mostly x86-based. These are often physically small compared to a standard PC, although still quite large compared to most simple (8/16-bit) embedded systems. They often use [[DOS]], [[Linux]], [[NetBSD]], or an embedded [[real-time operating system]] such as [[MicroC/OS-II]], [[QNX]] or [[VxWorks]]. Sometimes these boards use non-x86 processors.\n\nIn certain applications, where small size or power efficiency are not primary concerns, the components used may be compatible with those used in general-purpose x86 personal computers. Boards such as the VIA [[EPIA]] range help to bridge the gap by being PC-compatible but highly integrated, physically smaller or have other attributes making them attractive to embedded engineers. The advantage of this approach is that low-cost commodity components may be used along with the same software development tools used for general software development. Systems built in this way are still regarded as embedded since they are integrated into larger devices and fulfill a single role. Examples of devices that may adopt this approach are [[Automated teller machines|ATMs]] and [[arcade machines]], which contain code specific to the application.\n\nHowever, most ready-made embedded systems boards are not PC-centered and do not use the ISA or PCI busses. When a [[system-on-a-chip]] processor is involved, there may be little benefit to having a standardized bus connecting discrete components, and the environment for both hardware and software tools may be very different.\n\nOne common design style uses a small system module, perhaps the size of a business card, holding high density [[Ball grid array|BGA]] chips such as an [[ARM architecture|ARM]]-based [[system-on-a-chip]] processor and peripherals, external [[flash memory]] for storage, and [[Dynamic random access memory|DRAM]] for runtime memory. The module vendor will usually provide boot software and make sure there is a selection of operating systems, usually including [[Linux]] and some real-time choices. These modules can be manufactured in high volume, by organizations familiar with their specialized testing issues, and combined with much lower volume custom mainboards with application-specific external peripherals.\n\nImplementation of embedded systems has advanced so that they can easily be implemented with already-made boards that are based on worldwide accepted platforms. These platforms include, but are not limited to, [[Arduino]] and [[Raspberry Pi]].\n\n====ASIC and FPGA solutions====\nA common array for very-high-volume embedded systems is the [[system on a chip]] (SoC) that contains a complete system consisting of multiple processors, multipliers, caches and interfaces on a single chip. SoCs can be implemented as an [[application-specific integrated circuit]] (ASIC) or using a [[field-programmable gate array]] (FPGA).\n\n===Peripherals===\n[[File:SMSC LAN91C110 ethernet chip.jpg|thumb|A close-up of the SMSC LAN91C110 (SMSC 91x) chip, an embedded [[Ethernet]] chip]]\n\nEmbedded systems talk with the outside world via [[peripheral]]s, such as:\n* Serial Communication Interfaces (SCI): [[RS-232]], [[RS-422]], [[RS-485]], etc.\n* Synchronous Serial Communication Interface: [[I2C]], [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus|SPI]], SSC and ESSI (Enhanced Synchronous Serial Interface)\n* [[Universal Serial Bus]] (USB)\n* Multi Media Cards (SD cards, Compact Flash, etc.)\n* Networks: [[Ethernet]], [[LonWorks]], etc.\n* [[Fieldbus]]es: [[Controller Area Network|CAN-Bus]], [[Local Interconnect Network|LIN-Bus]], [[PROFIBUS]], etc.\n* Timers: [[Phase-locked loop|PLL]](s), Capture/Compare and [[Time Processing Unit]]s\n* Discrete IO: aka [[General Purpose Input/Output]] (GPIO)\n* Analog to Digital/Digital to Analog ([[Analog-to-digital converter|ADC]]/[[Digital-to-analog converter|DAC]])\n* Debugging: [[JTAG]], [[In-System Programming|ISP]], [[Background Debug Mode interface|BDM]] Port, BITP, and DB9 ports.\n\n===Tools===\nAs with other software, embedded system designers use [[compiler]]s, [[Assembly language|assemblers]], and [[debugger]]s to develop embedded system software. However, they may also use some more specific tools:\n* In circuit debuggers or emulators (see next section).\n* Utilities to add a checksum or [[Cyclic redundancy check|CRC]] to a program, so the embedded system can check if the program is valid.\n* For systems using [[digital signal processing]], developers may use a math workbench to simulate the mathematics.\n* System-level modeling and simulation tools help designers to construct simulation models of a system with hardware components such as [[processors]], [[memories]], [[Direct memory access|DMA]], [[Interface (computing)|interface]]s, buses and software behavior flow as a state diagram or flow diagram using configurable library blocks. Simulation is conducted to select right components by performing power vs. performance trade-off, reliability analysis and bottleneck analysis. Typical reports that help a designer to make architecture decisions includes application latency, device throughput, device utilization, power consumption of the full system as well as device-level power consumption.\n* A model-based development tool creates and simulates graphical data flow and UML state chart diagrams of components like digital filters, motor controllers, communication protocol decoding and multi-rate tasks.\n* Custom compilers and linkers may be used to optimize specialized hardware.\n* An embedded system may have its own special language or design tool, or add enhancements to an existing language such as [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]] or [[BASIC Stamp|Basic]].\n* Another alternative is to add a [[real-time operating system]] or [[embedded operating system]]\n* Modeling and code generating [[UML tool|tools]] often based on [[UML state machine|state machines]]\n\nSoftware tools can come from several sources:\n* Software companies that specialize in the embedded market\n* Ported from the [[GNU]] software development tools\n* Sometimes, development tools for a personal computer can be used if the embedded processor is a close relative to a common PC processor\n\nAs the complexity of embedded systems grows, higher-level tools and operating systems are migrating into machinery where it makes sense. For example, [[cellphone]]s, [[personal digital assistant]]s and other consumer computers often need significant software that is purchased or provided by a person other than the manufacturer of the electronics. In these systems, an open programming environment such as [[Linux]], [[NetBSD]], [[OSGi]] or [[Embedded Java]] is required so that the third-party software provider can sell to a large market.\n\nEmbedded systems are commonly found in consumer, cooking, industrial, automotive, and medical applications.\nSome examples of embedded systems are MP3 players, mobile phones, video game consoles, digital cameras, DVD players, and GPS. Household appliances, such as microwave ovens, washing machines and dishwashers, include embedded systems to provide flexibility and efficiency.\n\n==Debugging==\nEmbedded [[debugging]] may be performed at different levels, depending on the facilities available. The different metrics that characterize the different forms of embedded debugging are: does it slow down the main application, how close is the debugged system or application to the actual system or application, how expressive are the triggers that can be set for debugging (e.g., inspecting the memory when a particular [[program counter]] value is reached), and what can be inspected in the debugging process (such as, only memory, or memory and registers, etc.).\n\nFrom simplest to most sophisticated they can be roughly grouped into the following areas:\n* Interactive resident debugging, using the simple shell provided by the embedded operating system (e.g. Forth and Basic)\n* External debugging using logging or serial port output to trace operation using either a monitor in flash or using a debug server like the [[Remedy Debugger]] that even works for heterogeneous [[Multi-core processor|multicore]] systems.\n* An in-circuit debugger (ICD), a hardware device that connects to the microprocessor via a [[JTAG]] or [[Nexus (standard)|Nexus]] interface.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tancreti|first=Matthew|last2=Hossain|first2=Mohammad Sajjad|last3=Bagchi|first3=Saurabh|last4=Raghunathan|first4=Vijay|date=2011|title=Aveksha: A Hardware-software Approach for Non-intrusive Tracing and Profiling of Wireless Embedded Systems|journal=Proceedings of the 9th ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems|series=SenSys '11|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=288\u2013301|doi=10.1145/2070942.2070972|isbn=9781450307185}}</ref> This allows the operation of the microprocessor to be controlled externally, but is typically restricted to specific debugging capabilities in the processor. \n* An [[in-circuit emulator]] (ICE) replaces the microprocessor with a simulated equivalent, providing full control over all aspects of the microprocessor.\n* A complete [[emulator]] provides a simulation of all aspects of the hardware, allowing all of it to be controlled and modified, and allowing debugging on a normal PC. The downsides are expense and slow operation, in some cases up to 100 times slower than the final system.\n* For SoC designs, the typical approach is to verify and debug the design on an FPGA prototype board. Tools such as Certus<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eejournal.com/archives/articles/20121030-tektronix/ | title=Tektronix Shakes Up Prototyping, Embedded Instrumentation Boosts Boards to Emulator Status| publisher=Electronic Engineering Journal | date= 2012-10-30|accessdate=2012-10-30}}</ref> are used to insert probes in the FPGA RTL that make signals available for observation. This is used to debug hardware, firmware and software interactions across multiple FPGA with capabilities similar to a logic analyzer.\n* Software-only debuggers have the benefit that they do not need any hardware modification but have to carefully control what they record in order to conserve time and storage space.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tancreti|first=Matthew|last2=Sundaram|first2=Vinaitheerthan|last3=Bagchi|first3=Saurabh|last4=Eugster|first4=Patrick|date=2015|title=TARDIS: Software-only System-level Record and Replay in Wireless Sensor Networks|journal=Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks|series=IPSN '15|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=286\u2013297|doi=10.1145/2737095.2737096|isbn=9781450334754}}</ref>\n\nUnless restricted to external debugging, the programmer can typically load and run software through the tools, view the code running in the processor, and start or stop its operation. The view of the code may be as [[High-level programming language|HLL]] [[source-code]], [[assembly code]] or mixture of both.\n\nBecause an embedded system is often composed of a wide variety of elements, the debugging strategy may vary. For instance, debugging a software- (and microprocessor-) centric embedded system is different from debugging an embedded system where most of the processing is performed by peripherals (DSP, FPGA, and co-processor).\nAn increasing number of embedded systems today use more than one single processor core. A common problem with multi-core development is the proper synchronization of software execution. In this case, the embedded system design may wish to check the data traffic on the busses between the processor cores, which requires very low-level debugging, at signal/bus level, with a [[logic analyzer]], for instance.\n\n===Tracing===\n\nReal-time operating systems ([[RTOS]]) often supports [[tracing (software)|tracing]] of operating system events. A graphical view is presented by a host PC tool, based on a recording of the system behavior. The trace recording can be performed in software, by the RTOS, or by special tracing hardware. RTOS tracing allows developers to understand timing and performance issues of the software system and gives a good understanding of the high-level system behaviors.\n\n===Reliability===\nEmbedded systems often reside in machines that are expected to run continuously for years without errors, and in some cases recover by themselves if an error occurs. Therefore, the software is usually developed and tested more carefully than that for personal computers, and unreliable mechanical moving parts such as disk drives, switches or buttons are avoided.\n\nSpecific reliability issues may include:\n* The system cannot safely be shut down for repair, or it is too inaccessible to repair. Examples include space systems, undersea cables, navigational beacons, bore-hole systems, and automobiles.\n* The system must be kept running for safety reasons. \"Limp modes\" are less tolerable. Often backups are selected by an operator. Examples include aircraft navigation, reactor control systems, safety-critical chemical factory controls, train signals.\n* The system will lose large amounts of money when shut down: Telephone switches, factory controls, bridge and elevator controls, funds transfer and market making, automated sales and service.\n\nA variety of techniques are used, sometimes in combination, to recover from errors\u2014both software bugs such as [[memory leak]]s, and also [[soft error]]s in the hardware:\n* [[watchdog timer]] that resets the computer unless the software periodically notifies the watchdog subsystems with redundant spares that can be switched over to software \"limp modes\" that provide partial function\n* Designing with a [[Trusted Computing Base]] (TCB) architecture<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://c59951.r51.cf2.rackcdn.com/5557-528-heiser.pdf |title=Your System is secure?

This may also allow a subsystem to be automatically shut down and restarted on fault detection.\n* [[Immunity Aware Programming]]\n\n===High vs. low volume===\nFor high volume systems such as [[Digital audio player|portable music players]] or [[mobile phone]]s, minimizing cost is usually the primary design consideration. Engineers typically select hardware that is just \u201cgood enough\u201d to implement the necessary functions.\n\nFor low-volume or prototype embedded systems, general-purpose computers may be adapted by limiting the programs or by replacing the operating system with a [[real-time operating system]].\n\n==Embedded software architectures==\n{{Main|Embedded software}}\n\nIn 1978 [[National Electrical Manufacturers Association]] released a standard for programmable microcontrollers, including almost any computer-based controllers, such as single board computers, numerical, and event-based controllers.\n\nThere are several different types of software architecture in common use today.\n\n===Simple control loop===\nIn this design, the software simply has a [[loop (computing)|loop]]. The loop calls [[subroutine]]s, each of which manages a part of the hardware or software. Hence it is called a simple control loop or control loop.\n\n===Interrupt-controlled system===\nSome embedded systems are predominantly controlled by [[interrupt]]s. This means that tasks performed by the system are triggered by different kinds of events; an interrupt could be generated, for example, by a timer in a predefined frequency, or by a serial port controller receiving a byte.\n\nThese kinds of systems are used if event handlers need low latency, and the event handlers are short and simple. Usually, these kinds of systems run a simple task in a main loop also, but this task is not very sensitive to unexpected delays.\n\nSometimes the interrupt handler will add longer tasks to a queue structure. Later, after the interrupt handler has finished, these tasks are executed by the main loop. This method brings the system close to a multitasking kernel with discrete processes.\n\n===Cooperative multitasking===\nA non-preemptive multitasking system is very similar to the simple control loop scheme, except that the loop is hidden in an [[Application programming interface|API]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"Barr-glossary\" /> The programmer defines a series of tasks, and each task gets its own environment to \u201crun\u201d in. When a task is idle, it calls an idle routine, usually called \u201cpause\u201d, \u201cwait\u201d, \u201cyield\u201d, \u201cnop\u201d (stands for ''no operation''), etc.\n\nThe advantages and disadvantages are similar to that of the control loop, except that adding new software is easier, by simply writing a new task, or adding to the queue.\n\n===Preemptive multitasking or multi-threading===\nIn this type of system, a low-level piece of code switches between tasks or threads based on a timer (connected to an interrupt). This is the level at which the system is generally considered to have an \"operating system\" kernel. Depending on how much functionality is required, it introduces more or less of the complexities of managing multiple tasks running conceptually in parallel.\n\nAs any code can potentially damage the data of another task (except in larger systems using an [[Memory management unit|MMU]]) programs must be carefully designed and tested, and access to shared data must be controlled by some synchronization strategy, such as [[message queue]]s, [[semaphore (programming)|semaphores]] or a [[non-blocking synchronization]] scheme.\n\nBecause of these complexities, it is common for organizations to use a [[real-time operating system]] (RTOS), allowing the application programmers to concentrate on device functionality rather than operating system services, at least for large systems; smaller systems often cannot afford the overhead associated with a ''generic'' real-time system, due to limitations regarding memory size, performance, or battery life. The choice that an RTOS is required brings in its own issues, however, as the selection must be done prior to starting to the application development process. This timing forces developers to choose the embedded operating system for their device based upon current requirements and so restricts future options to a large extent.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.clarinox.com/docs/whitepapers/Whitepaper_06_CrossPlatformDiscussion.pdf\n|title= Working across Multiple Embedded Platforms\n|publisher=clarinox\n|accessdate=2010-08-17\n}}</ref> The restriction of future options becomes more of an issue as product life decreases. Additionally, the level of complexity is continuously growing as devices are required to manage variables such as serial, USB, TCP/IP, [[Bluetooth]], [[Wireless LAN]], trunk radio, multiple channels, data and voice, enhanced graphics, multiple states, multiple threads, numerous wait states and so on. These trends are leading to the uptake of [[embedded middleware]] in addition to a real-time operating system.\n\n===Microkernels and exokernels===\nA [[microkernel]] is a logical step up from a real-time OS. The usual arrangement is that the operating system kernel allocates memory and switches the CPU to different threads of execution. User-mode processes implement major functions such as file systems, network interfaces, etc.\n\nIn general, microkernels succeed when task switching and intertask communication is fast and fail when they are slow.\n\n[[Exokernel]]s communicate efficiently by normal subroutine calls. The hardware and all the software in the system are available to and extensible by application programmers.\n\n===Monolithic kernels===\nIn this case, a relatively large kernel with sophisticated capabilities is adapted to suit an embedded environment. This gives programmers an environment similar to a desktop operating system like [[Linux]] or [[Microsoft Windows]], and is therefore very productive for development; on the downside, it requires considerably more hardware resources, is often more expensive, and, because of the complexity of these kernels, can be less predictable and reliable.\n\nCommon examples of embedded monolithic kernels are [[embedded Linux]], [[VXWorks]] and [[Windows CE]].\n\nDespite the increased cost in hardware, this type of embedded system is increasing in popularity, especially on the more powerful embedded devices such as [[wireless router]]s and [[Automotive navigation system|GPS navigation systems]]. Here are some of the reasons:\n* Ports to common embedded chip sets are available.\n* They permit re-use of publicly available code for [[device driver]]s, [[web server]]s, [[Firewall (networking)|firewalls]], and other code.\n* Development systems can start out with broad feature-sets, and then the distribution can be configured to exclude unneeded functionality, and save the expense of the memory that it would consume.\n* Many engineers believe that running application code in user mode is more reliable and easier to debug, thus making the development process easier and the code more portable.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n* Features requiring faster response than can be guaranteed can often be placed in [[Programmable logic device|hardware]].\n\n===Additional software components===\nIn addition to the core operating system, many embedded systems have additional upper-layer software components. These components consist of networking protocol stacks like [[Controller\u2013area network|CAN]], [[TCP/IP]], [[FTP]], [[HTTP]], and [[HTTPS]], and also included storage capabilities like [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] and flash memory management systems. If the embedded device has audio and video capabilities, then the appropriate drivers and codecs will be present in the system. In the case of the monolithic kernels, many of these software layers are included.

In either case, the processor(s) used may be types ranging from general purpose to those specialized in a certain class of computations, or even custom designed for the application at hand. A common standard class of dedicated processors is the [[digital signal processor]] (DSP).\n\nSince the embedded system is dedicated to specific tasks, [[design engineer]]s can optimize it to reduce the size and cost of the product and increase the reliability and performance. Some embedded systems are mass-produced, benefiting from [[economies of scale]].\n\nEmbedded systems range from portable devices such as [[digital watch]]es and [[MP3 player]]s, to large stationary installations like [[Traffic light control and coordination|traffic light controllers]], [[programmable logic controller]]s, and large complex systems like [[hybrid vehicles]], [[medical imaging]] systems, and [[avionics]]. Complexity varies from low, with a single microcontroller chip, to very high with multiple units, [[peripheral]]s and networks mounted inside a large [[equipment rack]].\n\n==History==\n=== Background ===\n{{See also|Microprocessor chronology}}\n\nThe origins of the [[microprocessor]] and the [[microcontroller]] can be traced back to the [[MOS integrated circuit]], which is an [[integrated circuit]] chip [[semiconductor device fabrication|fabricated]] from [[MOSFET]]s (metal-oxide-semiconductor [[field-effect transistor]]s) and was developed in the early 1960s. By 1964, MOS chips had reached higher [[transistor density]] and lower manufacturing costs than [[bipolar junction transistor|bipolar]] chips. MOS chips further increased in complexity at a rate predicted by [[Moore's law]], leading to [[large-scale integration]] (LSI) with hundreds of [[transistors]] on a single MOS chip by the late 1960s. The application of MOS LSI chips to [[computing]] was the basis for the first microprocessors, as engineers began recognizing that a complete [[computer processor]] system could be contained on several MOS LSI chips.<ref name=\"ieee\">{{cite journal |last1=Shirriff |first1=Ken |title=The Surprising Story of the First Microprocessors |journal=[[IEEE Spectrum]] |volume=53 |issue=9 |pages=48\u201354 |date=30 August 2016 |publisher=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] |url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-history/silicon-revolution/the-surprising-story-of-the-first-microprocessors |accessdate=13 October 2019|doi=10.1109/MSPEC.2016.7551353 }}</ref>\n\nThe first multi-chip microprocessors, the [[Four-Phase Systems AL1]] in 1969 and the [[Garrett AiResearch]] [[MP944]] in 1970, were developed with multiple MOS LSI chips. The first single-chip microprocessor was the [[Intel 4004]], released in 1971. It was developed by [[Federico Faggin]], using his [[silicon-gate]] MOS technology, along with [[Intel]] engineers [[Marcian Hoff]] and [[Stan Mazor]], and [[Busicom]] engineer [[Masatoshi Shima]].<ref>{{cite web |title=1971: Microprocessor Integrates CPU Function onto a Single Chip |website=The Silicon Engine |url=https://www.computerhistory.org/siliconengine/microprocessor-integrates-cpu-function-onto-a-single-chip/ |publisher=[[Computer History Museum]] |accessdate=22 July 2019}}</ref><!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\n=== Development ===\nOne of the very first recognizably modern embedded systems was the [[Apollo Guidance Computer]],{{citation needed|reason=linked article claims it is the first IC-based computer. nothing there supports it being the first embedded system.|date=August 2018}} developed ca. 1965 by [[Charles Stark Draper]] at the [[MIT Instrumentation Laboratory]]. At the project's inception, the Apollo guidance computer was considered the riskiest item in the Apollo project as it employed the then newly developed [[monolithic integrated circuit]]s to reduce the size and weight. \n\nAn early mass-produced embedded system was the [[D-17B|Autonetics D-17 guidance computer]] for the [[Minuteman (missile)|Minuteman missile]], released in 1961. When the Minuteman II went into production in 1966, the D-17 was replaced with a new computer that was the first high-volume use of integrated circuits.\n\nSince these early applications in the 1960s, embedded systems have come down in price and there has been a dramatic rise in processing power and functionality. An early [[microprocessor]], the [[Intel 4004]] (released in 1971), was designed for [[calculator]]s and other small systems but still required external memory and support chips. By the early 1980s, memory, input and output system components had been integrated into the same chip as the processor forming a [[microcontroller]]. As the cost of microprocessors and microcontrollers fell it became feasible to replace expensive knob-based [[Analogue electronics|analog]] components such as [[potentiometer]]s and [[variable capacitor]]s with up/down buttons or knobs read out by a microprocessor even in consumer products. Microcontrollers find applications where a general-purpose computer would be too costly.\n\nToday, a comparatively low-cost microcontroller may be programmed to fulfill the same role as a large number of separate components. Although in this context an embedded system is usually more complex than a traditional solution, most of the complexity is contained within the microcontroller itself. Very few additional components may be needed and most of the design effort is in the software. Software prototype and test can be quicker compared with the design and construction of a new circuit not using an embedded processor.\n\n==Applications==\n[[File:Accupoll-embedded-computer.jpg|thumb|Embedded Computer Sub-Assembly for Accupoll Electronic Voting Machine<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/|title=Electronic Frontier Foundation|website=Electronic Frontier Foundation}}</ref>]]\n\nEmbedded systems are commonly found in consumer, industrial, [[Automotive industry|automotive]], [[home appliance]]s, medical, commercial and military applications.\n\n[[Telecommunication]]s systems employ numerous embedded systems from [[telephone switch]]es for the network to [[Mobile phone|cell phones]] at the [[end user]].\nComputer networking uses dedicated [[Router (computing)|routers]] and [[network bridge]]s to route data.\n\n[[Consumer electronics]] include [[MP3 player]]s, mobile phones, [[video game console]]s, [[digital camera]]s, [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] receivers, and [[computer printer|printers]].\nHousehold appliances, such as [[microwave oven]]s, [[washing machine]]s and [[dishwashers]], include embedded systems to provide flexibility, efficiency and features. Advanced [[HVAC]] systems use networked [[thermostat]]s to more accurately and efficiently control temperature that can change by time of day and [[season]]. [[Home automation]] uses wired- and wireless-networking that can be used to control lights, climate, security, audio/visual, surveillance, etc., all of which use embedded devices for sensing and controlling.\n\nTransportation systems from flight to automobiles increasingly use embedded systems.\nNew airplanes contain advanced [[avionics]] such as [[inertial guidance system]]s and [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] receivers that also have considerable safety requirements.\nVarious electric motors \u2014 [[brushless DC motor]]s, [[induction motor]]s and [[DC motor]]s \u2014 use electric/electronic [[motor controller]]s.\n[[Automobile]]s, [[electric vehicle]]s, and [[hybrid vehicle]]s increasingly use embedded systems to maximize efficiency and reduce pollution.\nOther automotive safety systems include [[anti-lock braking system]] (ABS), [[Electronic Stability Control]] (ESC/ESP), [[Traction control system|traction control]] (TCS) and automatic [[four-wheel drive]].\n\n[[Medical equipment]] uses embedded systems for [[vital signs]] monitoring, [[electronic stethoscope]]s for amplifying sounds, and various [[medical imaging]] ([[Positron emission tomography|PET]], [[Single photon emission computed tomography|SPECT]], [[Computed tomography|CT]], and [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]]) for non-invasive internal inspections. Embedded systems within medical equipment are often powered by industrial computers.<ref>[http://content.dell.com/us/en/enterprise/oem-industry-solutions-build-your-product-with-dell Embedded Systems Dell OEM Solutions | Dell].

In dealing with security, the embedded systems can be self-sufficient and be able to deal with cut electrical and communication systems.\n\nA new class of miniature wireless devices called [[mote (sensor)|motes]] are networked wireless sensors. Wireless sensor networking, [[WSN]], makes use of miniaturization made possible by advanced IC design to couple full wireless subsystems to sophisticated sensors, enabling people and companies to measure a myriad of things in the physical world and act on this information through IT monitoring and control systems. These motes are completely self-contained, and will typically run off a battery source for years before the batteries need to be changed or charged.\n\nEmbedded Wi-Fi modules provide a simple means of wirelessly enabling any device that communicates via a serial port.\n\n==Characteristics==\nEmbedded systems are designed to do some specific task, rather than be a general-purpose computer for multiple tasks. Some also have [[Real-time computing|real-time]] performance constraints that must be met, for reasons such as safety and usability; others may have low or no performance requirements, allowing the system hardware to be simplified to reduce costs.\n\nEmbedded systems are not always standalone devices. Many embedded systems consist of small parts within a larger device that serves a more general purpose. For example, the [[Gibson Robot Guitar]] features an embedded system for tuning the strings, but the overall purpose of the Robot Guitar is, of course, to play music.<ref>[http://www.embedded.com/underthehood/207401418 Embedded.com \u2013 Under the Hood: Robot Guitar embeds autotuning] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708195311/http://embedded.com/underthehood/207401418 |date=2008-07-08 }} By David Carey, TechOnline EE Times (04/22/08, 11:10:00 AM EDT)Embedded Systems Design \u2013 Embedded.com</ref> Similarly, an embedded system in an [[automobile]] provides a specific function as a subsystem of the car itself.\n\n[[File:ESOM270 eSOM300 Computer on Modules.jpg|thumb|e-con Systems eSOM270 & eSOM300 Computer on Modules]]\nThe program instructions written for embedded systems are referred to as [[firmware]], and are stored in read-only memory or [[flash memory]] chips. They run with limited computer hardware resources: little memory, small or non-existent keyboard or screen.\n\n===User interface===\n[[File:MicroVGA TUI demoapp.jpg|thumb|Embedded system [[text user interface]] using MicroVGA<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"MicroVGA\">For more details of MicroVGA see this [http://www.microvga.com/pdf/uvga-text-ds.pdf PDF].</ref>]]\n\nEmbedded systems range from [[Headless system|no user interface]] at all, in systems dedicated only to one task, to complex [[Desktop operating system#Graphical user interfaces|graphical user interfaces]] that resemble modern computer desktop operating systems.\nSimple embedded devices use [[Push-button|buttons]], [[LED]]s, graphic or character [[LCD]]s ([[Hitachi HD44780 LCD controller|HD44780 LCD]] for example) with a simple [[menu (computing)|menu system]].\n\nMore sophisticated devices that use a graphical screen with [[touch screen|touch]] sensing or screen-edge buttons provide flexibility while minimizing space used: the meaning of the buttons can change with the screen, and selection involves the natural behavior of pointing at what is desired. [[Mobile device|Handheld systems]] often have a screen with a \"joystick button\" for a pointing device.\n\nSome systems provide user interface remotely with the help of a serial (e.g. [[RS-232]], [[USB]], [[I\u00b2C]], etc.) or network (e.g. [[Ethernet]]) connection. This approach gives several advantages: extends the capabilities of embedded system, avoids the cost of a display, simplifies [[Board support package|BSP]] and allows one to build a rich user interface on the PC. A good example of this is the combination of an [[Embedded HTTP server|embedded web server]] running on an embedded device (such as an [[IP camera]]) or a [[Router (computing)|network router]]. The user interface is displayed in a [[web browser]] on a PC connected to the device, therefore needing no software to be installed.\n\n===Processors in embedded systems===\nExamples of properties of typical embedded computers, when compared with general-purpose counterparts, are low power consumption, small size, rugged operating ranges, and low per-unit cost. This comes at the price of limited processing resources, which make them significantly more difficult to program and to interact with. However, by building intelligence mechanisms on top of the hardware, taking advantage of possible existing sensors and the existence of a network of embedded units, one can both optimally manage available resources at the unit and network levels as well as provide augmented functions, well beyond those available.<ref name=\"Alippi2014\">C.Alippi: ''Intelligence for Embedded Systems.'' Springer, 2014, 283pp, {{ISBN|978-3-319-05278-6}}.</ref> For example, intelligent techniques can be designed to manage power consumption of embedded systems.<ref>S. Mittal, \"[https://www.academia.edu/4186102/A_survey_of_techniques_for_improving_energy_efficiency_in_embedded_computing_systems A survey of techniques for improving energy efficiency in embedded computing systems]\", IJCAET, 6(4), 440\u2013459, 2014.</ref>\n\nEmbedded processors can be broken into two broad categories. Ordinary microprocessors (\u03bcP) use separate integrated circuits for memory and peripherals. Microcontrollers (\u03bcC) have on-chip peripherals, thus reducing power consumption, size and cost. In contrast to the personal computer market, many different basic [[CPU architecture]]s are used since the software is custom-developed for an application and is not a commodity product installed by the end user. Both [[Von Neumann architecture|Von Neumann]] as well as various degrees of [[Harvard architecture]]s are used. [[RISC]] as well as non-RISC processors are found. Word lengths vary from 4-bit to 64-bits and beyond, although the most typical remain 8/16-bit. Most architectures come in a large number of different variants and shapes, many of which are also manufactured by several different companies.\n\n[[List of common microcontrollers|Numerous microcontrollers]] have been developed for embedded systems use. General-purpose microprocessors are also used in embedded systems, but generally, require more support circuitry than microcontrollers.\n\n====Ready-made computer boards====\n[[PC/104]] and PC/104+ are examples of standards for ''ready-made'' computer boards intended for small, low-volume embedded and ruggedized systems, mostly x86-based. These are often physically small compared to a standard PC, although still quite large compared to most simple (8/16-bit) embedded systems. They often use [[DOS]], [[Linux]], [[NetBSD]], or an embedded [[real-time operating system]] such as [[MicroC/OS-II]], [[QNX]] or [[VxWorks]]. Sometimes these boards use non-x86 processors.\n\nIn certain applications, where small size or power efficiency are not primary concerns, the components used may be compatible with those used in general-purpose x86 personal computers. Boards such as the VIA [[EPIA]] range help to bridge the gap by being PC-compatible but highly integrated, physically smaller or have other attributes making them attractive to embedded engineers. The advantage of this approach is that low-cost commodity components may be used along with the same software development tools used for general software development. Systems built in this way are still regarded as embedded since they are integrated into larger devices and fulfill a single role. Examples of devices that may adopt this approach are [[Automated teller machines|ATMs]] and [[arcade machines]], which contain code specific to the application.\n\nHowever, most ready-made embedded systems boards are not PC-centered and do not use the ISA or PCI busses. When a [[system-on-a-chip]] processor is involved, there may be little benefit to having a standardized bus connecting discrete components, and the environment for both hardware and software tools may be very different.\n\nOne common design style uses a small system module, perhaps the size of a business card, holding high density [[Ball grid array|BGA]] chips such as an [[ARM architecture|ARM]]-based [[system-on-a-chip]] processor and peripherals, external [[flash memory]] for storage, and [[Dynamic random access memory|DRAM]] for runtime memory. The module vendor will usually provide boot software and make sure there is a selection of operating systems, usually including [[Linux]] and some real-time choices. These modules can be manufactured in high volume, by organizations familiar with their specialized testing issues, and combined with much lower volume custom mainboards with application-specific external peripherals.\n\nImplementation of embedded systems has advanced so that they can easily be implemented with already-made boards that are based on worldwide accepted platforms. These platforms include, but are not limited to, [[Arduino]] and [[Raspberry Pi]].\n\n====ASIC and FPGA solutions====\nA common array for very-high-volume embedded systems is the [[system on a chip]] (SoC) that contains a complete system consisting of multiple processors, multipliers, caches and interfaces on a single chip. SoCs can be implemented as an [[application-specific integrated circuit]] (ASIC) or using a [[field-programmable gate array]] (FPGA).\n\n===Peripherals===\n[[File:SMSC LAN91C110 ethernet chip.jpg|thumb|A close-up of the SMSC LAN91C110 (SMSC 91x) chip, an embedded [[Ethernet]] chip]]\n\nEmbedded systems talk with the outside world via [[peripheral]]s, such as:\n* Serial Communication Interfaces (SCI): [[RS-232]], [[RS-422]], [[RS-485]], etc.\n* Synchronous Serial Communication Interface: [[I2C]], [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus|SPI]], SSC and ESSI (Enhanced Synchronous Serial Interface)\n* [[Universal Serial Bus]] (USB)\n* Multi Media Cards (SD cards, Compact Flash, etc.)\n* Networks: [[Ethernet]], [[LonWorks]], etc.\n* [[Fieldbus]]es: [[Controller Area Network|CAN-Bus]], [[Local Interconnect Network|LIN-Bus]], [[PROFIBUS]], etc.\n* Timers: [[Phase-locked loop|PLL]](s), Capture/Compare and [[Time Processing Unit]]s\n* Discrete IO: aka [[General Purpose Input/Output]] (GPIO)\n* Analog to Digital/Digital to Analog ([[Analog-to-digital converter|ADC]]/[[Digital-to-analog converter|DAC]])\n* Debugging: [[JTAG]], [[In-System Programming|ISP]], [[Background Debug Mode interface|BDM]] Port, BITP, and DB9 ports.\n\n===Tools===\nAs with other software, embedded system designers use [[compiler]]s, [[Assembly language|assemblers]], and [[debugger]]s to develop embedded system software. However, they may also use some more specific tools:\n* In circuit debuggers or emulators (see next section).\n* Utilities to add a checksum or [[Cyclic redundancy check|CRC]] to a program, so the embedded system can check if the program is valid.\n* For systems using [[digital signal processing]], developers may use a math workbench to simulate the mathematics.\n* System-level modeling and simulation tools help designers to construct simulation models of a system with hardware components such as [[processors]], [[memories]], [[Direct memory access|DMA]], [[Interface (computing)|interface]]s, buses and software behavior flow as a state diagram or flow diagram using configurable library blocks. Simulation is conducted to select right components by performing power vs. performance trade-off, reliability analysis and bottleneck analysis. Typical reports that help a designer to make architecture decisions includes application latency, device throughput, device utilization, power consumption of the full system as well as device-level power consumption.\n* A model-based development tool creates and simulates graphical data flow and UML state chart diagrams of components like digital filters, motor controllers, communication protocol decoding and multi-rate tasks.\n* Custom compilers and linkers may be used to optimize specialized hardware.\n* An embedded system may have its own special language or design tool, or add enhancements to an existing language such as [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]] or [[BASIC Stamp|Basic]].\n* Another alternative is to add a [[real-time operating system]] or [[embedded operating system]]\n* Modeling and code generating [[UML tool|tools]] often based on [[UML state machine|state machines]]\n\nSoftware tools can come from several sources:\n* Software companies that specialize in the embedded market\n* Ported from the [[GNU]] software development tools\n* Sometimes, development tools for a personal computer can be used if the embedded processor is a close relative to a common PC processor\n\nAs the complexity of embedded systems grows, higher-level tools and operating systems are migrating into machinery where it makes sense. For example, [[cellphone]]s, [[personal digital assistant]]s and other consumer computers often need significant software that is purchased or provided by a person other than the manufacturer of the electronics. In these systems, an open programming environment such as [[Linux]], [[NetBSD]], [[OSGi]] or [[Embedded Java]] is required so that the third-party software provider can sell to a large market.\n\nEmbedded systems are commonly found in consumer, cooking, industrial, automotive, and medical applications.\nSome examples of embedded systems are MP3 players, mobile phones, video game consoles, digital cameras, DVD players, and GPS. Household appliances, such as microwave ovens, washing machines and dishwashers, include embedded systems to provide flexibility and efficiency.\n\n==Debugging==\nEmbedded [[debugging]] may be performed at different levels, depending on the facilities available. The different metrics that characterize the different forms of embedded debugging are: does it slow down the main application, how close is the debugged system or application to the actual system or application, how expressive are the triggers that can be set for debugging (e.g., inspecting the memory when a particular [[program counter]] value is reached), and what can be inspected in the debugging process (such as, only memory, or memory and registers, etc.).\n\nFrom simplest to most sophisticated they can be roughly grouped into the following areas:\n* Interactive resident debugging, using the simple shell provided by the embedded operating system (e.g. Forth and Basic)\n* External debugging using logging or serial port output to trace operation using either a monitor in flash or using a debug server like the [[Remedy Debugger]] that even works for heterogeneous [[Multi-core processor|multicore]] systems.\n* An in-circuit debugger (ICD), a hardware device that connects to the microprocessor via a [[JTAG]] or [[Nexus (standard)|Nexus]] interface.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tancreti|first=Matthew|last2=Hossain|first2=Mohammad Sajjad|last3=Bagchi|first3=Saurabh|last4=Raghunathan|first4=Vijay|date=2011|title=Aveksha: A Hardware-software Approach for Non-intrusive Tracing and Profiling of Wireless Embedded Systems|journal=Proceedings of the 9th ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems|series=SenSys '11|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=288\u2013301|doi=10.1145/2070942.2070972|isbn=9781450307185}}</ref> This allows the operation of the microprocessor to be controlled externally, but is typically restricted to specific debugging capabilities in the processor. \n* An [[in-circuit emulator]] (ICE) replaces the microprocessor with a simulated equivalent, providing full control over all aspects of the microprocessor.\n* A complete [[emulator]] provides a simulation of all aspects of the hardware, allowing all of it to be controlled and modified, and allowing debugging on a normal PC. The downsides are expense and slow operation, in some cases up to 100 times slower than the final system.\n* For SoC designs, the typical approach is to verify and debug the design on an FPGA prototype board. Tools such as Certus<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eejournal.com/archives/articles/20121030-tektronix/ | title=Tektronix Shakes Up Prototyping, Embedded Instrumentation Boosts Boards to Emulator Status| publisher=Electronic Engineering Journal | date= 2012-10-30|accessdate=2012-10-30}}</ref> are used to insert probes in the FPGA RTL that make signals available for observation. This is used to debug hardware, firmware and software interactions across multiple FPGA with capabilities similar to a logic analyzer.\n* Software-only debuggers have the benefit that they do not need any hardware modification but have to carefully control what they record in order to conserve time and storage space.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tancreti|first=Matthew|last2=Sundaram|first2=Vinaitheerthan|last3=Bagchi|first3=Saurabh|last4=Eugster|first4=Patrick|date=2015|title=TARDIS: Software-only System-level Record and Replay in Wireless Sensor Networks|journal=Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks|series=IPSN '15|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=286\u2013297|doi=10.1145/2737095.2737096|isbn=9781450334754}}</ref>\n\nUnless restricted to external debugging, the programmer can typically load and run software through the tools, view the code running in the processor, and start or stop its operation. The view of the code may be as [[High-level programming language|HLL]] [[source-code]], [[assembly code]] or mixture of both.\n\nBecause an embedded system is often composed of a wide variety of elements, the debugging strategy may vary. For instance, debugging a software- (and microprocessor-) centric embedded system is different from debugging an embedded system where most of the processing is performed by peripherals (DSP, FPGA, and co-processor).\nAn increasing number of embedded systems today use more than one single processor core. A common problem with multi-core development is the proper synchronization of software execution. In this case, the embedded system design may wish to check the data traffic on the busses between the processor cores, which requires very low-level debugging, at signal/bus level, with a [[logic analyzer]], for instance.\n\n===Tracing===\n\nReal-time operating systems ([[RTOS]]) often supports [[tracing (software)|tracing]] of operating system events. A graphical view is presented by a host PC tool, based on a recording of the system behavior. The trace recording can be performed in software, by the RTOS, or by special tracing hardware. RTOS tracing allows developers to understand timing and performance issues of the software system and gives a good understanding of the high-level system behaviors.\n\n===Reliability===\nEmbedded systems often reside in machines that are expected to run continuously for years without errors, and in some cases recover by themselves if an error occurs. Therefore, the software is usually developed and tested more carefully than that for personal computers, and unreliable mechanical moving parts such as disk drives, switches or buttons are avoided.\n\nSpecific reliability issues may include:\n* The system cannot safely be shut down for repair, or it is too inaccessible to repair. Examples include space systems, undersea cables, navigational beacons, bore-hole systems, and automobiles.\n* The system must be kept running for safety reasons. \"Limp modes\" are less tolerable.

This may also allow a subsystem to be automatically shut down and restarted on fault detection.\n* [[Immunity Aware Programming]]\n\n===High vs. low volume===\nFor high volume systems such as [[Digital audio player|portable music players]] or [[mobile phone]]s, minimizing cost is usually the primary design consideration. Engineers typically select hardware that is just \u201cgood enough\u201d to implement the necessary functions.\n\nFor low-volume or prototype embedded systems, general-purpose computers may be adapted by limiting the programs or by replacing the operating system with a [[real-time operating system]].\n\n==Embedded software architectures==\n{{Main|Embedded software}}\n\nIn 1978 [[National Electrical Manufacturers Association]] released a standard for programmable microcontrollers, including almost any computer-based controllers, such as single board computers, numerical, and event-based controllers.\n\nThere are several different types of software architecture in common use today.\n\n===Simple control loop===\nIn this design, the software simply has a [[loop (computing)|loop]]. The loop calls [[subroutine]]s, each of which manages a part of the hardware or software. Hence it is called a simple control loop or control loop.\n\n===Interrupt-controlled system===\nSome embedded systems are predominantly controlled by [[interrupt]]s. This means that tasks performed by the system are triggered by different kinds of events; an interrupt could be generated, for example, by a timer in a predefined frequency, or by a serial port controller receiving a byte.\n\nThese kinds of systems are used if event handlers need low latency, and the event handlers are short and simple. Usually, these kinds of systems run a simple task in a main loop also, but this task is not very sensitive to unexpected delays.\n\nSometimes the interrupt handler will add longer tasks to a queue structure. Later, after the interrupt handler has finished, these tasks are executed by the main loop. This method brings the system close to a multitasking kernel with discrete processes.\n\n===Cooperative multitasking===\nA non-preemptive multitasking system is very similar to the simple control loop scheme, except that the loop is hidden in an [[Application programming interface|API]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"Barr-glossary\" /> The programmer defines a series of tasks, and each task gets its own environment to \u201crun\u201d in. When a task is idle, it calls an idle routine, usually called \u201cpause\u201d, \u201cwait\u201d, \u201cyield\u201d, \u201cnop\u201d (stands for ''no operation''), etc.\n\nThe advantages and disadvantages are similar to that of the control loop, except that adding new software is easier, by simply writing a new task, or adding to the queue.\n\n===Preemptive multitasking or multi-threading===\nIn this type of system, a low-level piece of code switches between tasks or threads based on a timer (connected to an interrupt). This is the level at which the system is generally considered to have an \"operating system\" kernel. Depending on how much functionality is required, it introduces more or less of the complexities of managing multiple tasks running conceptually in parallel.\n\nAs any code can potentially damage the data of another task (except in larger systems using an [[Memory management unit|MMU]]) programs must be carefully designed and tested, and access to shared data must be controlled by some synchronization strategy, such as [[message queue]]s, [[semaphore (programming)|semaphores]] or a [[non-blocking synchronization]] scheme.\n\nBecause of these complexities, it is common for organizations to use a [[real-time operating system]] (RTOS), allowing the application programmers to concentrate on device functionality rather than operating system services, at least for large systems; smaller systems often cannot afford the overhead associated with a ''generic'' real-time system, due to limitations regarding memory size, performance, or battery life. The choice that an RTOS is required brings in its own issues, however, as the selection must be done prior to starting to the application development process. This timing forces developers to choose the embedded operating system for their device based upon current requirements and so restricts future options to a large extent.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.clarinox.com/docs/whitepapers/Whitepaper_06_CrossPlatformDiscussion.pdf\n|title= Working across Multiple Embedded Platforms\n|publisher=clarinox\n|accessdate=2010-08-17\n}}</ref> The restriction of future options becomes more of an issue as product life decreases. Additionally, the level of complexity is continuously growing as devices are required to manage variables such as serial, USB, TCP/IP, [[Bluetooth]], [[Wireless LAN]], trunk radio, multiple channels, data and voice, enhanced graphics, multiple states, multiple threads, numerous wait states and so on. These trends are leading to the uptake of [[embedded middleware]] in addition to a real-time operating system.\n\n===Microkernels and exokernels===\nA [[microkernel]] is a logical step up from a real-time OS. The usual arrangement is that the operating system kernel allocates memory and switches the CPU to different threads of execution. User-mode processes implement major functions such as file systems, network interfaces, etc.\n\nIn general, microkernels succeed when task switching and intertask communication is fast and fail when they are slow.\n\n[[Exokernel]]s communicate efficiently by normal subroutine calls. The hardware and all the software in the system are available to and extensible by application programmers.\n\n===Monolithic kernels===\nIn this case, a relatively large kernel with sophisticated capabilities is adapted to suit an embedded environment. This gives programmers an environment similar to a desktop operating system like [[Linux]] or [[Microsoft Windows]], and is therefore very productive for development; on the downside, it requires considerably more hardware resources, is often more expensive, and, because of the complexity of these kernels, can be less predictable and reliable.\n\nCommon examples of embedded monolithic kernels are [[embedded Linux]], [[VXWorks]] and [[Windows CE]].\n\nDespite the increased cost in hardware, this type of embedded system is increasing in popularity, especially on the more powerful embedded devices such as [[wireless router]]s and [[Automotive navigation system|GPS navigation systems]]. Here are some of the reasons:\n* Ports to common embedded chip sets are available.\n* They permit re-use of publicly available code for [[device driver]]s, [[web server]]s, [[Firewall (networking)|firewalls]], and other code.\n* Development systems can start out with broad feature-sets, and then the distribution can be configured to exclude unneeded functionality, and save the expense of the memory that it would consume.\n* Many engineers believe that running application code in user mode is more reliable and easier to debug, thus making the development process easier and the code more portable.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n* Features requiring faster response than can be guaranteed can often be placed in [[Programmable logic device|hardware]].\n\n===Additional software components===\nIn addition to the core operating system, many embedded systems have additional upper-layer software components. These components consist of networking protocol stacks like [[Controller\u2013area network|CAN]], [[TCP/IP]], [[FTP]], [[HTTP]], and [[HTTPS]], and also included storage capabilities like [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] and flash memory management systems. If the embedded device has audio and video capabilities, then the appropriate drivers and codecs will be present in the system. In the case of the monolithic kernels, many of these software layers are included. In the RTOS category, the availability of the additional software components depends upon the commercial offering.\n\n===Domain-specific architectures===\nIn the automotive sector, [[AUTOSAR]] is a standard architecture for embedded software.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Communications server]]\n* [[Cyber-physical system]]\n* [[Digital signal processing|DSP]]\n* [[Electronic control unit]]\n* [[Hypervisor]]\n* [[Embedded operating system]]s\n* [[Embedded software]]\n* [[Firmware]]\n* [[FPGA]]\n* [[Information appliance]]\n* [[Microprocessor]]\n* [[Microcontroller]]\n* [[Silicon compiler]]\n* [[Real-time operating system]]\n* [[Software engineering]]\n* [[System on a chip]]\n* [[System on module]]\n* [[Ubiquitous computing]]\n* [[Photonically Optimized Embedded Microprocessors]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n<references group=\"nb\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite book |title=Designing Embedded Hardware, 2nd Edition |author=John Catsoulis |date=May 2005 |publisher=O'Reilly |isbn=0-596-00755-8}}\n* {{Cite book |title=Embedded Systems, An Introduction Using the Renesas RX62N Microcontroller |author1=James M.

[[Henry Evans Maude|H.E. Maude]] and Niel Gunson had both assumed it to be the very whaler ''Mary,'' as owned by John Lydekker (1778\u20131832) and that her captain, a Edward Reed Lacy, had named the island. The one entry for August 5, 1824, of that ''Mary's'' logbook, however, makes no mention of a discovery or a vessel ''Ph\u0153nix''. The ship ''Mary'' that was truly there that day (her captain was presumably Abijah Lock) happened to be also a whaler from London yet was in fact owned by ''Hill, Boulcott & Hill'', a firm that consisted of the two brothers James & Amon Hill and their brother-in-law [[John Ellerker Boulcott]].

During this time, the American party claimed the island for the United States, erecting a small monument with two American flags. According to one account, the British warship [[HMS Wellington (U65)|HMS ''Wellington'']] fired a shot across the bow of the [[USS Avocet (AVP-4)|USS ''Avocet'']], when the latter refused to cede the choicest anchorage spot to the British vessel.<ref>Degener & Gillaspy, pp. 8\u20139.</ref> The American ship allegedly responded in kind, following which both captains agreed to \"cease fire\" until instructions could be received from their respective governments. [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] and [[London]] quickly ordered no further escalation, and both parties observed the solar eclipse together, \"though officially a bit cool.\"<ref>Degener & Gillaspy, p. 10.</ref>\n\nIn response to the British reoccupation of Kanton in August&nbsp;1937, seven Americans from the [[American Equatorial Islands Colonization Project]] landed on the island on 7&nbsp;March 1938. Although the British ambassador to the United States requested removal of markers claiming U.S. sovereignty, President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] formally placed the island under control of the U.S. Interior department on 3&nbsp;March 1938. Both parties continued to press their competing claims until 6&nbsp;April 1939, when the U.S. and Britain agreed to hold Kanton under joint control for the next fifty years as the [[Canton and Enderbury Islands]] [[condominium (international law)|condominium]]. The U.S./U.K. tenure proved cordial and cooperative thereafter, with each party enjoying the other's hospitality and working together to ensure smooth operation of island facilities.

[[British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines]] (BCPA), Australia's first trans-Pacific airline, served the island via a cooperative agreement with [[Australian National Airways]] (ANA) initially with Douglas DC-4's on a routing of Sydney - Auckland - Fiji - Kanton Island - Honolulu - San Francisco - Vancouver, with the inaugural flight departing Australia on 15&nbsp;September 1946.  BCPA then began flying luxurious [[Douglas DC-6B]]s on the Sydney to Vancouver route. [[Qantas]] took over this service shortly thereafter as BCPA subsequently ceased all operations and went out of business. [[Canadian Pacific Airlines]] also used the island as well for its Douglas DC-4 service between Vancouver and the southern hemisphere.<ref>Degener & Gillaspy, p. 12.</ref> A full-scale community was established to support these airline operations, including an electrical power station, a hotel for the airline passengers' use, a medical dispensary, school for dependent children of station personnel, and other necessary facilities. The island was jointly administered by the United Kingdom and the United States, and the British and American post offices were both operated from a single building. The American administrator, who was an employee of the [[Civil Aeronautics Administration (United States)|Civil Aeronautics Administration]] (predecessor to the [[FAA]]) and island manager for that agency, also served as the U.S. resident administrator under the Department of the Interior and as a U.S. special deputy marshal under the Department of Justice. William J. Evans held this position from 1952\u20131956, during which time a crew from ''[[National Geographic Magazine|National Geographic]]'' magazine visited the island and highlighted it in the magazine's January 1955 issue.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Walker |first=Howell |title=Air age grings life to Canton Island |magazine=The [[National Geographic Magazine]] |date=January 1955 |pages=117\u2013132}}</ref>\n\nVice-President [[Richard Nixon]] and his wife visited the island in October&nbsp;1953, en route to New Zealand, where they stayed overnight and were interviewed by Fred Carpenter for the local radio station KIBS.<ref>{{cite web |title=RNZI Airs new Radio Heritage Feature - The Lost Nixon Tape - KIBS Canton Island 1953 |publisher=Radio Heritage Foundation |url=http://www.radioheritage.net/RHF_Media_Release_20121008_RNZI.pdf |date=8 October 2012 | accessdate=23 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Sounds Historical - 16&nbsp;June 2013 - Show Notes - 8:23 Mr and Mrs&nbsp;Nixon |publisher=Radio New Zealand | url = http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/soundshistorical |date=16 June 2013 |accessdate=23 June 2013}}</ref>  By 1956, Pan Am was operating a [[Boeing 377 Stratocruiser]] service into the airport from Los Angeles and San Francisco, via a stop in Honolulu, with these flights continuing on to [[Sydney]] with a stop at [[Nadi Airport]] in [[Fiji]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.timetableimages.com |date=1 July 1956 |title=Pan American World Airways system timetable}}</ref>\n\nUltimately, the introduction of long-range jet aircraft spelled the end of Kanton's usefulness as an aircraft refueling station, and all airlines ended their operations there by the late 1950s&mdash;except for Pan Am, which continued a monthly service with [[Douglas DC-7C]] prop aircraft via Auckland, Nadi, Pago Pago, Kanton, Honolulu and return. This service was conducted using the outbased DC-7C aircraft N743PA and N744PA, which provided feeder service from Auckland to three points on the jet service schedules. The last Pan Am flight was in November 1965 when the final DC-7C returned to Miami after the opening of a new airport in Auckland, enabling New Zealand to be added to Pan Am's [[Boeing 707]] jet routes. Kanton's airport remained operational, however, as an emergency landing field.\n\n[[File:Kanton Island 02.jpg|thumb|left|House on Kanton Island, 2008.]]\n\n===After the airlines===\nIn 1960 a tracking station for the [[Mercury program]] was built on Kanton, and used through November&nbsp;1965. The U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Space and Missile Systems Organization continued to use the island for missile-tracking operations through 1976. That year marked the complete end of the American presence; the airfield was abandoned and all U.S. personnel were removed.<ref>http://www.tighar.org/TTracks/14_1/Kanton_Mission.html.</ref> The British closed their [[post office]], ending their presence on Kanton as well. With the independence of [[Kiribati]] from Britain in 1979, the Anglo-American condominium was formally terminated, and the island transferred to Kiribati sovereignty. Kanton's post office was reopened by the Kiribati government, and the island was repopulated with a few people from the more crowded atolls of the [[Gilbert Islands]], who reside in several of the abandoned residences left over from the Anglo-American presence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uscg.mil/d14/units/kukui/Kanton.htm |title=USCGC Kukui (WLB - 203)|author=|date=|website=www.uscg.mil|accessdate=4 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nKanton is occasionally visited by Republic of Kiribati vessels, the [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] and various fishing boats.

[[Henry Evans Maude|H.E. Maude]] and Niel Gunson had both assumed it to be the very whaler ''Mary,'' as owned by John Lydekker (1778\u20131832) and that her captain, a Edward Reed Lacy, had named the island. The one entry for August 5, 1824, of that ''Mary's'' logbook, however, makes no mention of a discovery or a vessel ''Ph\u0153nix''. The ''Mary'' that was truly there that day (her captain was presumably Abijah Lock) happened to be also a whaler from London yet was in fact owned by ''Hill, Boulcott & Hill'', a firm that consisted of the two brothers James & Amon Hill and their brother-in-law [[John Ellerker Boulcott]]. He was married to a Mary Boulcott, n\u00e9e Hill, and it was she whom this island was named for.

During this time, the American party claimed the island for the United States, erecting a small monument with two American flags. According to one account, the British warship [[HMS Wellington (U65)|HMS ''Wellington'']] fired a shot across the bow of the [[USS Avocet (AVP-4)|USS ''Avocet'']], when the latter refused to cede the choicest anchorage spot to the British vessel.<ref>Degener & Gillaspy, pp. 8\u20139.</ref> The American ship allegedly responded in kind, following which both captains agreed to \"cease fire\" until instructions could be received from their respective governments. [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] and [[London]] quickly ordered no further escalation, and both parties observed the solar eclipse together, \"though officially a bit cool.\"<ref>Degener & Gillaspy, p. 10.</ref>\n\nIn response to the British reoccupation of Kanton in August&nbsp;1937, seven Americans from the [[American Equatorial Islands Colonization Project]] landed on the island on 7&nbsp;March 1938. Although the British ambassador to the United States requested removal of markers claiming U.S. sovereignty, President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] formally placed the island under control of the U.S. Interior department on 3&nbsp;March 1938. Both parties continued to press their competing claims until 6&nbsp;April 1939, when the U.S. and Britain agreed to hold Kanton under joint control for the next fifty years as the [[Canton and Enderbury Islands]] [[condominium (international law)|condominium]]. The U.S./U.K. tenure proved cordial and cooperative thereafter, with each party enjoying the other's hospitality and working together to ensure smooth operation of island facilities. A United States office was open between 1940 and 1965 and from 1970.<ref name=\"Post Office\">{{Cite web  |last=Premier Postal History |title=Post Office List |publisher=Premier Postal Auctions |url = https://www.premierpostal.com/cgi-bin/wsProd.sh/Viewpocdwrapper.p?SortBy=ge&country= |accessdate=5 July 2013}}</ref> Canton Island Post Office opened on 25&nbsp;January 1941 and closed around February 1968.\n\n===Airplane oasis===\n[[Pan American World Airways]] (Pan Am) arrived on Kanton on 18&nbsp;May 1939, to build facilities for their planned [[New Zealand]] flying boat service.<ref name=\"JRi\"/> Service commenced on 12&nbsp;July 1940 with the [[Boeing 314 Clipper]].

[[British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines]] (BCPA), Australia's first trans-Pacific airline, served the island via a cooperative agreement with [[Australian National Airways]] (ANA) initially with Douglas DC-4's on a routing of Sydney - Auckland - Fiji - Kanton Island - Honolulu - San Francisco - Vancouver, with the inaugural flight departing Australia on 15&nbsp;September 1946.  BCPA then began flying luxurious [[Douglas DC-6B]]s on the Sydney to Vancouver route. [[Qantas]] took over this service shortly thereafter as BCPA subsequently ceased all operations and went out of business. [[Canadian Pacific Airlines]] also used the island as well for its Douglas DC-4 service between Vancouver and the southern hemisphere.<ref>Degener & Gillaspy, p. 12.</ref> A full-scale community was established to support these airline operations, including an electrical power station, a hotel for the airline passengers' use, a medical dispensary, school for dependent children of station personnel, and other necessary facilities. The island was jointly administered by the United Kingdom and the United States, and the British and American post offices were both operated from a single building. The American administrator, who was an employee of the [[Civil Aeronautics Administration (United States)|Civil Aeronautics Administration]] (predecessor to the [[FAA]]) and island manager for that agency, also served as the U.S. resident administrator under the Department of the Interior and as a U.S. special deputy marshal under the Department of Justice. William J. Evans held this position from 1952\u20131956, during which time a crew from ''[[National Geographic Magazine|National Geographic]]'' magazine visited the island and highlighted it in the magazine's January 1955 issue.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Walker |first=Howell |title=Air age grings life to Canton Island |magazine=The [[National Geographic Magazine]] |date=January 1955 |pages=117\u2013132}}</ref>\n\nVice-President [[Richard Nixon]] and his wife visited the island in October&nbsp;1953, en route to New Zealand, where they stayed overnight and were interviewed by Fred Carpenter for the local radio station KIBS.<ref>{{cite web |title=RNZI Airs new Radio Heritage Feature - The Lost Nixon Tape - KIBS Canton Island 1953 |publisher=Radio Heritage Foundation |url=http://www.radioheritage.net/RHF_Media_Release_20121008_RNZI.pdf |date=8 October 2012 | accessdate=23 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Sounds Historical - 16&nbsp;June 2013 - Show Notes - 8:23 Mr and Mrs&nbsp;Nixon |publisher=Radio New Zealand | url = http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/soundshistorical |date=16 June 2013 |accessdate=23 June 2013}}</ref>  By 1956, Pan Am was operating a [[Boeing 377 Stratocruiser]] service into the airport from Los Angeles and San Francisco, via a stop in Honolulu, with these flights continuing on to [[Sydney]] with a stop at [[Nadi Airport]] in [[Fiji]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.timetableimages.com |date=1 July 1956 |title=Pan American World Airways system timetable}}</ref>\n\nUltimately, the introduction of long-range jet aircraft spelled the end of Kanton's usefulness as an aircraft refueling station, and all airlines ended their operations there by the late 1950s&mdash;except for Pan Am, which continued a monthly service with [[Douglas DC-7C]] prop aircraft via Auckland, Nadi, Pago Pago, Kanton, Honolulu and return. This service was conducted using the outbased DC-7C aircraft N743PA and N744PA, which provided feeder service from Auckland to three points on the jet service schedules. The last Pan Am flight was in November 1965 when the final DC-7C returned to Miami after the opening of a new airport in Auckland, enabling New Zealand to be added to Pan Am's [[Boeing 707]] jet routes. Kanton's airport remained operational, however, as an emergency landing field.\n\n[[File:Kanton Island 02.jpg|thumb|left|House on Kanton Island, 2008.]]\n\n===After the airlines===\nIn 1960 a tracking station for the [[Mercury program]] was built on Kanton, and used through November&nbsp;1965. The U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Space and Missile Systems Organization continued to use the island for missile-tracking operations through 1976. That year marked the complete end of the American presence; the airfield was abandoned and all U.S. personnel were removed.<ref>http://www.tighar.org/TTracks/14_1/Kanton_Mission.html.</ref> The British closed their [[post office]], ending their presence on Kanton as well. With the independence of [[Kiribati]] from Britain in 1979, the Anglo-American condominium was formally terminated, and the island transferred to Kiribati sovereignty. Kanton's post office was reopened by the Kiribati government, and the island was repopulated with a few people from the more crowded atolls of the [[Gilbert Islands]], who reside in several of the abandoned residences left over from the Anglo-American presence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uscg.mil/d14/units/kukui/Kanton.htm |title=USCGC Kukui (WLB - 203)|author=|date=|website=www.uscg.mil|accessdate=4 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nKanton is occasionally visited by Republic of Kiribati vessels, the [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] and various fishing boats.

The first wine queen was Ruth Bachrodt<ref name=\"hagen\">{{cite web |author=Lilo Hagen |title=Die Theysohns |url=http://www.lilo-hagen.de/die-theysohns.htm |access-date=2012-09-13 \n}} \u2013 Reference for the correct spelling of the name Bachrodt \u2013 mit dt</ref> of [[Pirmasens]] in the Southwest Palatinate. This part of the Palatinate has no vineyards and Bachrodt owed her election to the fact that the organizers felt she was the prettiest girl in the audience in the festival hall (the ''Saalbau'' in Neustadt) and the judges upheld their proposal.<ref name=\"bachrodt\">{{cite web |author=pfaelzische-weinkoenigin.de |title=Historisches |url=http://www.pfaelzische-weinkoenigin.de/kroenung/historisches.php |access-date=2012-09-13}}</ref> The  candidate had previously been asked the question, \"What does a wine queen in all circumstances?\" Bachrodt had replied, \"you definitely need a pair of good shoes, so you can work in the vineyard.\" With that she also impressed the Pirmasens shoe manufacturer, Daniel Theysohn, and they were married in 1938.<ref name=\"hagen\" />\n\nBecause the Palatine Wine Queen in Germany was the only wine queen for many years, she also represented German wine as a whole until 1939 and then again from 1947 to 1949 without needing to go through any further competition. In 1949, too, there was only one competition, but subsequently [[Elizabeth Gies|Elisabeth Kuhn, later Gies]] from [[Diedesfeld]] officially became the [[German Wine Queen]] and was thus the only person to hold the titles of Palatine Wine Queen and German Wine Queen in the same year.<ref name=\"yoopress\">{{cite web |author=Arthur Wirtzfeld |title=Im k\u00f6niglichen R\u00fcckblick: Elisabeth Gies \u2013 German Wine Queen vor 60 Jahren |url=http://www.yoopress.com/de/weinnews/weinkollektive/dwi-deutsches-weininstitut/2932.Im_koeniglichen_Rueckblick_Elisabeth_Gies_-_German_Weinkoenigin_vor__Jahren.html |date=2010-09-01 |access-date=2012-09-13}}</ref>\n\n== Competition process ==\nThe election of the Palatine Wine Queen traditionally takes place during the [[German Wine Festival]], in the ''Saalbau'' in the town of [[Neustadt an der Weinstra\u00dfe]], on the Friday of the first weekend of the festival at the end of September or early October.

{"title_page": "Sexual slavery in Islam", "text_new": "'''Sexual slavery in Islam''' results from the permission in [[Islamic law]] for men to have sexual intercourse with the female slaves they own. Legal and literary documents show that those slaves used for sexual service were differentiated at slave markets from those who were intended mainly for domestic services. These slave girls were called \"slaves for pleasure\" (mu\u1e6d\u02bfa, ladhdha) or \u201cslave-girls for sexual intercourse\u201d (jaw\u0101r\u012b al-wa\u1e6d). Many female slaves became concubines to their owners and bore their children. Others were just used for sex before being transferred. The allowance for men to use contraception with female slaves assisted in thwarting unwanted pregnancies.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=196\u2013197}} \n\nEarly sources indicate that [[Sexual slavery|sexual slavery]] of women was viewed as both a male privilege and a privilege for the victor over the defeated. Islamic legal texts state that sexual pleasure was a male privilege over women. Men were permitted to have as many concubines as they could afford. Some men purchased female slaves, whereas [[Muslims|Muslim]] soldiers in the [[Early Muslim conquests|early Islamic conquests]] were given female captives as a reward for military participation. As the slaves for pleasure were typically more expensive, they were a privilege for elite men.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=203}}\n==Islamic legal sanction==\nIn Islam, it is the male's ownership of a woman's [[Vagina|sexual organs]] which makes sex licit. [[Faq\u012bh|Islamic jurists]] also describe marriage as a kind of sale where the wife's private parts are purchased. However, there are some differences between the rights of a [[wife]] and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}} The term ''suriyya'' (concubine) was used for female slaves with whom masters enjoyed sexual relations. It was not a secure status as the [[Concubinage|concubine]] could be traded as long as the master had not impregnated her.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=51}}\n\nIslamic law and Sunni ulama recognise two categories of concubines:{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=22}}\n*War Captives: \n**These are originally free non-Muslims who are captured in battle.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}{{sfn|Badawi|2019|p=17}} The entire population of a conquered territory can be enslaved, thus providing women who are otherwise rare on the battlefield. This paves the path for concubinage.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27}} The Muslim military commander is allowed to choose between unconditionally releasing, ransoming or enslaving war captives.{{sfn|Mufti|2019|p=5}} If a person converted to Islam after being enslaved, their emancipation would be considered a pious act but not obligatory.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=22}} Islamic law does not allow enslavement of free-born Muslims.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=142}}\n**Islamic jurists permitted slave raiding and kidnapping of non-Muslims from Dar al Harb.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27-28}} South Asian scholars ruled that jihad was not needed to seize non-muslims nor was it necessary to invite them to Islam before seizing them. Raiders were free to take and enslave any non-muslim.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=28}} However, Shafi'i jurists held that non-muslims who had formal pacts with Muslims were to be protected from enslavement.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27-28}} \n*Slave-girls by descent: \n**These are born to slave mothers.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=22}} Owners who would marry off their female slaves to someone else, would also be the masters of any children born from that marriage.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=57}} Thus, Islamic law made slave-breeding possible.{{sfn|Erdem|1996|p=52}}\n\nThe concubines were owned by their masters. The owners could obtain the slave-girls through purchase, capture or receive them as a gift.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} Islam permits men to have sexual intercourse with them and there is no limit on the number of concubines they could keep, unlike in [[Polygyny in Islam|polygamy]] where there is a limit of four wives.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=243}} The master could also sell her or gift her to someone else. The female slave was essentially a chattel. An owner's slave could also be inherited by an heir.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245}} While she was under her master's control the slave girl could not have sex with anyone else.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}}\n\n==The issue of consent==\nThe classical Islamic jurists make an analogy between the marriage contract and sale of concubines. They state that the factor of male ownership in both is what makes sex lawful with both a wife and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}}\n\nThe [[Hanafi]] scholars allow the husband to have sex with his wife against her will, as long as he has paid her dowry.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=83}} The [[Shafi\u2018i|Shafi'i]], [[Maliki]] and [[Hanbali]] schools do not forbid a husband from forcing his wife to have sex nor do they expressly say anything in favour of it. For all Sunni law schools the concept of marital rape is an oxymoron.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=120}} According to the Islamic jurists, rape is either a kind of zina or a property crime, which by definition cannot be committed by a husband or master, since he is the owner of his wife and slave's sexual capacity.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149-150}}\n\nThere is no requirement in any of the Sunni law schools for the master to have his female slave's consent before he has sex with her.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=148}} A slave, by legal definition, does not have the capacity to refuse consent.{{sfn|Seedat|2016|p=34}} The Hanafis explicitly state that a man may force the woman to sexually satisfy him.{{sfn|Nancy|2009|quote=The followers of Imam Abu Hanifah said: \"The right of the sexual pleasure belongs to the man, not the woman, by that it is meant that the man has the right to force the woman to gratify himself sexually.}} It is mentioned in Kitab al-Maghazi that [[Uthman|Uthman ibn Affan]] had sexual intercourse with a war captive, Zaynab bint Hayyan, and that she \"detested\" him.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\n[[Muhammad]] and his Companions took for granted the allowance of having sex with female war captives. The consent of the women was irrelevant. Some modern Muslim writers seek to defend Islam by claiming that Islam permits men to have sex with female captives as a way of integrating them into society.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=60}} But in the case of the women from the [[Banu Mustaliq]] tribe who were captured by the [[Companions of the Prophet|Companions]], their captors wanted to practice [[coitus interruptus]] during sex with them because if these women became pregnant their captors would not be able to return them in exchange for ransom. According to Kecia Ali, modern Muslim scholarship is silent on the question  of what it means to accept that Muhammad implicitly permitted Muslim soldiers to rape the female captives.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=61}}\n\nAll four law schools also have a consensus that the master can marry off his female slave to someone else without her consent.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A master can also practice coitus interruptus during sex with his female slave without her permission.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A man having sex with someone else's female slave constitutes [[zina]].{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}} According to [[Imam Shafi'i]] if someone other than the master coerces a slave-girl to have sex, the rapist will be required to pay compensation to her master.{{sfn|Ali|2011|p=76}} If a man  marries off his own female slave and has sex with her even though he is then no longer allowed to have sexual intercourse with her, that sex is still considered a lesser offence than zina and the jurists say he must not be punished. It is noteworthy that while formulating this ruling, it is the slave woman's marriage and not her consent which is an issue.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}}\n\n==Sexual enslavement, the concept of honour and humiliation==\nEnslavement was intended both as a debt and form of [[humiliation]]. The sexual relationship between a concubine and her master was viewed as a debt of humiliation upon the woman until she gave birth to her master's child and the master's later death.{{sfn|Willis|2014}} Becoming a slave meant losing one's [[honour]] and one's rights.{{sfn|McMahon|2013|p=18}} The ulama asserted that slavery was a divine punishment for not being a Muslim. In the words of az-Aziz b.Ahmad al-Bukhari \"servitude is a vestige of obstinacy in refusing to believe in one God\". [[Al-Sharif al-Jurjani]] stated that slavery in Islamic law was a \"penalty for unbelief.\" An Algerian scholar who lived in Morocco, [[Ahmad al-Wansharisi]], described the purpose of slavery as a \"humiliation\" for previous or continuing disbelief.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27}}\n\n==Umm Walad (slave mother)==\n''Umm walad'' (mother of child) is a title given to a woman who gave birth to her master's child.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} If a female slave gave birth to her master's child she still remained a slave. However, the master would no longer be allowed to sell her. She would also become free once he died. The Sunni law schools disagree on the concubine's entitlement to this status. Many Maliki jurists ruled that the concubine becomes entitled to the status of ''umm walad'' even if her master does not acknowledge that the child is his. However, Hanafi jurists state that the ''umm walad'' status is contingent on the master acknowledging paternity of the child. If he does not accept that he is the father of the child then both the mother and child remain slaves.{{sfn|Brockopp|2000|p=195\u2013196}}\n\n==Forced conversion for concubinage==\nMost traditional scholars require the conversion of a [[Paganism|pagan]] slave-girl before sex, even through force if necessary.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176\u2013177}} The majority of jurists do not allow sexual intercourse with Zoroastrian or pagan female captives. They require a conversion of these women before sex can take place. [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal|Ibn Hanbal]] allowed sexual intercourse with pagan and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] female captives if they are forced to become Musim. Many traditions state that the female captives should be forced to accept Islam if they do not convert willingly. [[Hasan al-Basri]] narrates that Muslims would achieve this objective through various methods. They would order the Zoroastrian slave-girl to face the [[qibla]]h, utter the [[shahada]] and perform [[Wudu|wudhu]]. Her captor would then have sex with her after one menstrual cycle. However, others add the condition that the slave-girl must be taught to pray and purify herself before the master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=107}}\n\nThe scholars significantly lower the threshold of conversion for the girls so that the master may be able to have sex with her as soon as possible. Only a few early scholars permitted sex with pagan and Zoroastrian slaves girls without conversion.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=108}} Al-Mujahid and Safiid bin al-Musayyab say the master can still have sex with his Zoroastrian or pagan female slave even if she refuses to convert.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176-177}}\n\n[[Al-Shafi\u2018i|Imam Shafi'i]] claims that the Companions of Muhammad did not have sexual intercourse with Arab captives until they converted to Islam.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=177}} But [[Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya|Ibn Qayyim]] argues that the Companions of the Prophet had sexual intercourse with Arab captives, such as the women of the Banu Mustaliq tribe, without making the sex conditional on the conversion of the women. He also asserted that no tradition required the conversion of a slave-girl before her master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=178}}\n\n==Sexual slavery in Pre-Islamic Arabia and Early Islam==\nThe pre-Islamic Arabs used to practice [[female infanticide]]. They would bury their daughters alive upon birth. One of the motivations for fathers burying their daughters alive was the fear that when they grew up an enemy tribe could take them captive and dishonour them.{{sfn|Giladi|1990|p=192}}{{sfn|Munir|2005|p=192}} A study of the Arab genealogical text Nasab Quraysh records the maternity of 3,000 [[Quraysh|Quraishi]] tribesmen, most of whom lived in between 500 and 750 CE.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=11}} The data shows that there was a massive increase in the number of children born to concubines with the emergence of Islam.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=11}} An analysis of the data found that no children were born from concubines before the generation of Muhammad's grandfather.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=16}} There were a few cases of children being born from concubines before Muhammad but they were only in his father's and grandfather's generation. The analysis of the data thus showed that concubinage was not common before the time of Muhammad, but increased for men of his generation as a result of military conquests.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=17}} Due to these conquests, a large number of female slaves were available to the conquerors. Although there were more births, the attitude towards children born from slaves still remained negative.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=12}}  Some early Arab Muslims discriminated against those people who were born fron non-Arab female slaves. However, there is no indication that these attitudes were ever acted upon.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=20-21}}\n\nOne of the earliest surviving Christian texts from the Islamic period in Syria, dated by scholars to around 640 CE, describes the rise of Islam in this way: \n\n{{quote|They take the wife away from her husband and slay him like a sheep.

So, we asked the Prophet about this matter, and this Ayah (verse) was revealed, Also (forbidden are) women already married, except those whom your right hands possess). Consequently, we had sexual relations with these women.\"</blockquote>\n\nMuhammad gave a girl called Zaynab bint Hayyan to Uthman ibn Affan. Uthman had sexual intercourse with her and she detested him. A woman was given to [['Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf|Abdurrahman ibn Awf]]. He resisted having sexual intercourse with her until her menses were over and then he had sex with her by virtue of her being his property. Jubayr bin Mu'tim also received a slave girl, who was not impregnated. [[Talhah|Talha ibn Ubaydullah]] had sexual intercourse with the female captive given to him. [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah|Abu Ubaydah ibn Jarrah]] impregnated the slave girl he was given.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\nA delegation from the Hawazin tribe came to Muhammad and converted to Islam. Once they had given allegiance to Muhammad they asked about their captured families and property. They said \"Those who you have brought as captives are our mothers, sisters and aunts and they alone bring disgrace to peoples. O Prophet, we ask for your kindness and gerosity. Free our women.\" Muhammad gave them a choice between reclaiming their property or their women and children.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=267}} The Hawazin tribesmen responded that if they had to choose between reclaiming their property or their honour, they would choose their honour (their womenfolk).{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}}\n\nMuhammad returned their women and children to them.{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}} The girl who had been given to Abdurrahman ibn Awf was given a choice to stay with him or return to her family. She chose her family. Likewise, the girls given to Talha, Uthman, [[Abdullah ibn Umar|Ibn Umar]] and Safwan bin Umayya were also returned to their families. However, the girl who had been given to [[Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas|Saad ibn Abi Waqas]] chose to stay with him. Uyanya had taken an old woman. Her son approached him to ransom her for 100 camels. The old woman asked her son why would he pay a 100 camels when Uyanya would leave her anyway without taking ransom. This angered Uyanya.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=466}}\n\n==Overview of slave-concubines' experiences==\nBecoming a concubine for her master could translate to gaining security and standing and other material benefits. If she bore her master a child and if he accepted paternity she could obtain the position of an umm walad. If she bacame an umm walad her daily life would probably resemble that of a free wife, but with a lower position. There are many instances of slave concubines in Muslim history who rose to positions of great influence. However, this position did not lighten the suffering that the slaves experienced in their lives. Many of them had been forcibly taken from their homes and permanently separated from their families. They were displayed at slave markets and humiliated and subjected to forced labour, forced marriages and sex.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}}\n\nMany slaves went through a period of distress, when they were first enslaved, which was typically a violent occasion. Between the 800s and 1200s the four main ways to enslave a person were kidnapping, slave raids, piracy, and poverty. Islamic law only gave female slaves protection from sexual exploitation by anyone who was not their owner. The owner was obliged by Islamic law to provide his female slaves with food, clothing, and shelter.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} The disciplinary hitting of the slave was considered to be for the master's own good.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ayesha S.

While some idealise the lives of elite female slaves, many in practice suffered from abuse by both their owners and others.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because bearing her master's child could lead to freedom for a slave-girl, some female slaves had a motive to have sex with their owners. This angered the master's wives who would often punish such slaves.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}} The most regular opposition to concubinage came from free wives. Early moral stories depicted wives as victims of concubinage.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=81}}\n\nThe female slaves were traded as chattel.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because female slaves were traded among men and many of them had been owned by up to thirty men consecutively, they had a great deal of knowledge about sexual intercourse and were able to tutor elite adolescent males about sexual techniques.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}} Slave girls were seen as sexual commodities and were not allowed to cover themselves.{{sfn|Kamrava|2011|p=193}} Before being bought many women's bodies were examined. The Hanafis allowed potential male buyers to uncover and touch a female slave's arms, breasts and legs.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=218}} [[Umar]] prohibited slave girls from resembling free women and forbade them from covering their hair.{{sfn|El Fadl|2014|p=198}} Slave women did not veil and like prostitutes were exempt from a lot of the gender restrictions upon upper-class women. If a slave fornicated she also received less punishment than a respectable woman.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=81}}\n\nThe most fortunate female captives were women like [[Safiyya bint Huyayy|Safiyya]] and [[Juwayriyya bint al-Harith|Juwayriah]] who were freed from slavery and married Muhammad. The lives of female captives depended on whether her tribe could ransom her or if her captor chose to marry her. If neither of the two happened such women suffered because their captors owned their bodies and lives. If they were unattractive the captors would keep them as servants and if they were beautiful the captors were allowed to keep them as their concubines. The captors were also allowed to sell her. Due to this some female captives committed suicide.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}} There is an account of a woman called Sakhra, who was a female captive from the [[Banu Amir]] tribe. She committed suicide by throwing herself to the ground from a camel.{{sfn|Jones|1981|p=16}}\n\n==Socio-economic variations in historical concubinage==\nWhile Muslim cultures acknowledged concubinage, as well as a polygamy, as a man's legal right, in reality these were usually practiced only by the royalty and elite sections of society.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203}} The most highly desired slave-concubines in the Muslim world were not African women, but white girls, typically of Circassian or Georgian origin. However, they were very expensive.{{sfn|Miers|1975|p=56}} The large-scale availability of women for sexual slavery had a strong influence on Muslim thought, even though the \"[[harem]]\" culture of the elite was not mirrored by most of the Muslim population.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=52}} \n===Abbasid Caliphate===\nThe royals and nobles during the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] kept large numbers of concubines.

The Caliph [[al-Mutawakkil]] was reported to own 4,000 concubines.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=89}}\n\n===Andalusia===\nIn Muslim society in general, [[monogamy]] was common because keeping multiple wives and concubines was not affordable for many households.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=155}} The practice of keeping concubines was common in the Muslim upper class. Muslim rulers preferred having children with concubines because it helped them avoid the social and political complexities arising from marriage and kept their lineages separate from the other lineages in society.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}} One Umayyad ruler, [[Abd al-Rahman III]], was known to have possessed more than 6000 concubines.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=89}}\n\n===Ottoman Empire===\nThe [[Ottoman Sultans|Ottoman rulers]] would keep hundreds, even thousands, of concubines. Female war captives were often turned into concubines for the Ottoman rulers. Ambitious slave families associated with the palace would also frequently offer their daughters up as concubines.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203-204}} Slave traders would abduct and sell [[Circassians|Circassian]] girls.{{sfn|Yelbasi|2019|p=14}} Circassian and [[Georgians|Georgian]] women were systematically trafficked to eastern harems. This practice lasted into the 1890s.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203-204}} [[Fynes Moryson]] noted that some Muslim men would keep their wives in various cities while others would keep them in a single house and would keep adding as many women as their lusts permitted. He wrote that \"They buy free women to be their wives, or they buy \"conquered women\" at a lesser price to be their concubines.\"{{sfn|Witte|2015|p=283}} Ottoman society had provided avenues for men who wished to have extramarital sex. They could either marry more wives while wealthy men could possess slaves and use them for sex.{{sfn|Kia|2011|p=206}}\n\nSince the late 1300s Ottoman sultans would only permit heirs born from concubines to inherit their throne. Each concubine was only permitted to have one son. Once a concubine would bear a son she would spend the rest of her life plotting in favour of her son. If her son was to successfully become the next Sultan, she would become an unquestionable ruler. After the 1450s the Sultans stopped marrying altogether. Because of this there was great surprise when Sultan Sulayman fell in love with his concubine and married her. An Ottoman Sultan would have sexual relationships with only some women from his large collection of slave girls. This meant that a lot of the concubines were not given a family life if they were not desired by the Sultan. This effectively meant these women would have to spend the rest of their lives in virtual imprisonment. Some of these women would break the sharia by having [[Lesbian|homosexual]] relations.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=89}}\n\nResearch into Ottoman records show that polygamy was absent or rare in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.{{sfn|Irwin|2010|p=531}} Concubinage and polygamy were quite uncommon outside the elite.

The wife would punish the slave-girl later.{{sfn|Lal|2005|p=40}}\n\nLower class Muslims were generally monogamous. Since they hardly had any rivals, women of the lower and middle class sections of society fared better than upper-class women who had to contend with their husbands' other wives, slave-girls and concubines.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=61}} Shireen Moosvi has discovered Muslim marriage contracts from Surat, dating back to the 1650s. One stipulation in these [[Nikah|marriage contracts]] was that the husband was not to marry a second wife. Another stipulation was that the husband would not take a slave girl. These stipulations were common among middle-class Muslims in Surat. If the husband took a second wife the first wife would gain an automatic right of divorce, thus indicating the preference for monogamy among the merchants of Surat. If the husband took a slave-girl the wife could sell, free or give away that slave-girl, thereby separating the female slave from her husband.{{sfn|Faroqhi|2019|p=244}}\n\nThere is no evidence that concubinage was practiced in [[Kashmir]] where, unlike the rest of the medieval Muslim world, slavery was abhorred and not widespread.

There are several accounts of  such women of humble birth who associated with powerful Muslim men. While the associations were initially forced, the captivity gave women a taste for access to power. Diplomats wrote with disappointment about apostate women who wielded political influence over their masters-turned-husbands. Christian male slaves also recorded the presence of authoritative convert women in Muslim families. [[Christians|Christian]] women who converted to Islam and then became politically assertive and tyrannical were regarded by Europeans as traitors to the faith.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=59}} Enslaved Christian women lost all hope of returning home through ransom once they entered a Muslim household.

In 1296 approximately 16,000 women committed jauhar to save themselves from [[Alauddin Khalji|Alauddin Khalj]]<nowiki/>i's army.{{sfn|Roy|2012|p=182}} Rajput women would commit it when they saw that defeat and enslavement was imminent for their people.{{sfn|Kitts|2018|p=143}} In 1533 in [[Chittorgarh]] nearly 13,000 women and children killed themselves instead of being taken captive by [[Bahadur Shah]]'s army.{{sfn|Kitts|2018|p=144}} For them sexual intercourse was the worst form of humiliation. Rajputs practised jauhar mainly when their opponents were Muslims.{{sfn|Naravane|1999|p=45}}\n\nThe womenfolk of enemies were captured both to humiliate their men and to use the beautiful maidens for various purposes.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=57}} Beautiful female captives were mostly used for sex.{{sfn|Singh|2016|p=72}} After the period of Akbar's rule enslavement of women continued to be used to punish their men. [[Jahangir]] explicitly ordered the destruction of the domain of the rebellious zamindar of [[Jaitpur State|Jaitpur]] and the capture of his women. Thus, his daughters and wives were captured and brought to the harem.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=354}} Aurangzeb would enslave rebellious peasants.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=91}} [[Manucci]] records that, during Mughal rule, when faujdars would enter rebellious villages they would take the most attractive girls and present them to the king. The rest would either be sold or kept for themselves.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=354}} [[Ahmad Shah Durrani|Ahmad Shah Abdali']]<nowiki/>s army captured Maratha women to fill Afghan harems.{{sfn|Singh|2006|p=68}} The Sikhs attacked Abdali and rescued 2,2000 Maratha girls.{{sfn|Singh|2015|p=78}}\n\n===Sexual enslavement of Muslim women by non-Muslim men===\nMuslim historical sources see the capture and concubinage of non-Muslim women as legitimate violence against women. The capture and enslavement of non-muslim women is described in a matter-of-fact way in the Muslim sources. However, the same practice was criticised when Christians captured Muslim women. In the eleventh century Christians began an aggressive policy towards Muslims in Andalus. Christian military leaders captured Muslim women and included eight year old Muslim [[Virginity|virgins]] as part of their war booty.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=171}} When [[Granada]] passed from Muslim rule to Christian rule, thousands of Moorish women were enslaved and trafficked to Europe.{{sfn|Capern|2019|p=22}} Muslim families tried to ransom their daughters, mothers and wives who had been captured and enslaved.{{sfn|Salzmann|2013|p=397}} Muslim women were kept as concubines by Christian men.<ref>{{cite book|author=Margaret C. Schaus|title=Women and Gender in Medieval Europe: An Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zb22AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA593|date=20 September 2006|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-135-45967-3|pages=593\u2013}}</ref>\n\nFor both Christians and Muslims, the capture of women from the other religion was a show of power, while the capture and sexual use of their own women by men of the other religion was a cause of shame. Many women would convert to their master's religion.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}} In one case an Algerian woman, Fatima, was captured and enslaved. She converted to Christianity and refused the ransom which the [[Turkish people|Turks]] had sent for her release. Other enslaved Muslim women had more \"harrowing\" experiences in being converted to [[Christianity]].{{sfn|Bekkaoui|2010|p=10}}\n\nIn India, the Hindu  elites and rulers would take revenge by taking Muslim women into their own harems.{{sfn|Singh|2016|p=72}} [[Rana Kumbha]] captured Muslim women. Under [[Medini Rai]] in [[Malwa]], the Rajputs took Muslim and [[Syed|Sayyid]] women as slave girls.{{sfn|Sharma|2011|p=101}} According to [[Niccolao Manucci|Manucci]], the Marathas and [[Sikhs]] would also capture Muslim women because 'the Mahomedans had interfered with Hindu women.'{{sfn|Singh|2016|p=72}}\n\n===Sexual enslavement of Muslim women by Muslim men===\nIslamic jurists had completely forbidden the enslavement of Muslims. However, Muslims have still at times enslaved Muslims from other ethnic groups.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=53}} The [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] caliph [[Muhammad II of C\u00f3rdoba]] gave orders that the Berber houses in [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|Cordoba]] be looted and that Berber women be captured and sold in Dar-al Banat.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=166}} In another case the Andalusian ruler of [[M\u00e1laga|Malaga]], Ibn Hassun, unsuccessfully attempted to kill his female relatives before the Berber [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads]] could capture them. He committed suicide but his daughters survived. These girls were then sold and some of them were taken as concubines by Almohad military commanders.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=168}}\n\nIn India attitudes towards women ignored their religious background if they belonged to enemies or rebels. [[Ferishta]] narrates that Baban captured female supporters of the rebellious noble [[Tughral Tughan Khan|Tughral]]. The atrocities of [[Alauddin Khalji|Alauddin Khilji]] on women have been documented in [[Tabaqat-i-Akbari]] by [[Nizamuddin Ahmad]].  [[Khusrau Khan]] humiliated [[Qutbuddin Mubarak Shah|Sultan Qutb ud din Mubarak]] by marrying his widow and allowing Hindus to take away his other female relatives. [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abu Fazl]] records atrocities by [[Kamran Mirza|Kamran]] on the female relatives of [[Humayun]]'s supporters. [[Sher Shah Suri|Sher Shah]] was reported to have sold the wives of rebellious zamindars.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=64}}\n\n[[Kurds]] in the Ottoman-Persian frontier would enslave both Shias and Yazidis. The Ottoman jurist [[Ebussuud Efendi|Ebu Su'ud]] upheld the permissibility of wars against the Shia but he forbade the taking of Shias as captives. In particular, he also declared that sexual intercourse with Shia female captives was unlawful. However, he endorsed enslavement of Shias in a later fatwa.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=43}} In 1786-7 an Ottoman general enslaved the wives and children of [[Mamluk]] emirs. In the region of modern day [[Chad]], Muslim women and children from [[Sultanate of Bagirmi|Bagirmi]] were enslaved by the ruler of Wadai around 1800.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=44}} \n\n==Modern Muslim attitudes==\nWhile classical [[Sharia|Islamic law]] permits sexual slavery, the vast majority of Muslims today oppose it. This contradiction is demonstrated by Ahmed Hassan, a twentieth century translator of Sahih Muslim, who prefaced the translated chapter on marriage by claiming that Islam only allows sex within marriage. This was despite the fact that the same chapter included many references to Muslim men having sex with slave-girls.{{sfn|Hazelton|2010|p=107}} Most ordinary Muslims ignore the existence of slavery and concubinage in Islamic history and texts. Most also ignore the millennia old consensus permitting it and a few writers even claim that those Islamic jurists who allowed sexual relations outside marriage with female slaves were mistaken.{{sfn|Hazelton|2010|p=108}} For example, [[Muhammad Asad]], rejected the notion of any sexual relationship outside of marriage.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Asad|first=Muhammad|title=The Message of the Quran.

However, Kecia Ali states that this view is not found anywhere in the pre-modern Islamic legal tradition.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=148}} \n===Abolition===\nColonial governments and independent Muslim states restricted slave raids and the slave trade in response to pressure from Western liberals and weak Muslim abolitionist movements. Eliminating slavery was an even more difficult task. Many Muslim governments refused to sign the international treaties against slavery which the [[League of Nations]] was co-ordinating since 1926. This refusal was also an issue at the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and at the [[Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery|1956 Anti-Slavery Convention]].{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=11}} It was mostly because of the pressure from European colonial powers and economic changes that slavery was abolished. White the institution was eventually abolished, there was no internally well-developed Islamic narrative against slave-ownership.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=54}}\n\nA group of ulama led by Waji al-Din Saharanpuri gave a fatwa in the 1830s that it was lawful to enslave men and women \"who sought refuge\" after battle. Sayyed Imdad Ali Akbarabadi led ulama in publishing a lot of material in defence of traditional kinds of slavery. Sayyid Muhammad Askari condemned the idea of abolishing slavery. A conservative [[Deobandi]] scholar published a book in [[Lahore]] in 1946 in which he denied that the Prophet had ever encouraged the abolition of slavery.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=135}} [[Armenians]] and other Christian rebels who had been enslaved in [[World War I]] were considered to be \"people of the book\" who had violated their contract. Hence, one [[Palestinian]] shaykh ruled that Muslims could buy those Christian girls from the slave markets in the Levant.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=141-142}}\n\nIn the 19th century some ulama in Cairo refused to allow slave girls, who had been freed under secular law, to marry unless they had obtained permission from their owner.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=138}} Most ulama in [[West Africa]] opposed abolition.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=144-145}} They ruled that concubinage was still allowed with women of slave descent.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=145}} In 1911 one Qadi ruled that no government can free a slave without the owner's permission.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=146}} [[J. Spencer Trimingham|Spencer Trimingham]] observed that masters continued to take concubines from slave families because the descendants of slaves are still enslaved under religious law even if they have been freed according to secular law.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=147}} \n\nAfter 1947, the ulama in Pakistan called for the revival of slavery. The wish to enslave enemies and take concubines was noted in the [[Punjab Disturbances Court of Inquiry|Munir Commission Report]]. When [[Zia ul Haq]] came to power in 1977 and started applying sharia, some argued that the reward for freeing slaves meant that slavery should not be abolished \"since to do so would be to deny future generations the opportunity to commit the virtuous deed of freeing slaves.\"{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=189}} [[Muhammad Taqi Usmani|Mufti Taqi Usmani]] states that slavery and turning captives into concubines is still allowed by Islam. However, he states that due to the fact that most Muslim countries have signed international treaties which prohibit enslavement, the Muslim countries should not enslave prisoners of war as long as other nations also refrain from enslavement.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Usmani |first1=Muftii Taqi |title=Slavery in Islam |url=https://www.deoband.org/2013/01/hadith/hadith-commentary/slavery-in-islam/ |website=Deoband.org}}</ref>\n\nA lot of ulama in Mauritania did not recognise the legitimacy of abolishing slavery. In 1981 a group of ulama argued that only owners could free their slaves and that the Mauritanian government was breaking a fundamental religious rule. In 1997 one [[Mauritanian]] scholar stated that abolition:{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=147}}\n\n<blockquote>\"is contrary to the teachings of the fundamental text of Islamic law, the Koran... [and] amounts to the expropriation from Muslims of their gods, goods that were acquired legally. The state, if it is Islamic, does not have the right to seize my house, my wife or my slave.\"</blockquote>\n\nIn response to the enslavement of [[Yazidis|Yazidi]] women by [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] the [[Council on American\u2013Islamic Relations|Council on American-Islamic Relations]] and Fiqh Council of North America claimed that no scholar disputes the abolition of slavery was one of the aims of Islam. However, [[Kecia Ali]] finds this claim dishonest. While there was definitely  an \u201cemancipatory ethic\u201d (encouragement for freeing slaves) in Islamic jurisprudence, slavery was never actually abolished.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=6}} The translator of [[Ibn Kathir]]'s treatise on slaves, Umar ibn Sulayman Hafyan, felt obliged to explain why he published a slave treatise when [[slavery]] no longer exists. He states that just because slavery no longer exists does not mean that the laws about slavery have been abrogated. Moreover, slavery was only abolished half a century ago and could return in the future.  His comments were a reflection of the predicament modern Muslims find themselves in.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=304}}\n\n==Modern manifestations==\n===Middle East===\nArmenians underwent a [[Armenian Genocide|genocide]] in the Ottoman Empire, which climaxed around 1915-16. It has been accepted as the first  genocide of the 20th century by scholars of genocide and historians of the late Ottoman period.{{sfn|Sjoberg|2016|p=90}} The Ottomans had intended to destroy the Armenians.{{sfn|Eltringham|2014|p=14}} Derderuan notes that after being separated from their men who were killed, the Armenian women and children were raped, forcibly converted to Islam and subjected to sexual slavery. [[Eliz Sanasarian]] also notes the involvement of Turkish women in perpetrating violence against Armenian women by selling them into sexual slavery.{{sfn|Sjoberg|2016|p=91}} Women who were deemed beautiful were sold as sex slaves to military officials. The remaining women would be beaten and raped.{{sfn|Crawford|2017|p=13}} The women were also often forced into prostitution or forcibly married with non-Armenians.{{sfn|Demirdjian|2016|p=126}} Kidnapped Armenian girls were sorted on the basis of their age, beauty and marital status. The \"first choice\" was given to high-level Ottoman officials. Outside [[Mezre]], purchasers asked doctors to check the girls for diseases and to verify their virginity. One German reported the sale of girls in [[Ras al-Ayn]] and testified that the policemen carried out the trade in girls.{{sfn|Connellan|2017|p=141}} A few slave markers were set up in the vicinity of government buildings while Armenian captive sex slaves were kept in the Red Crescent Hospital in Trebizond.{{sfn|Connellan|2017|p=141-142}}\n\nA large number of free [[Baloch people|Baloch]] women were kidnapped in the first half of the 20th century by slave traders and sold across the [[Persian Gulf]]. For example, Yuri bint Lapek was abducted after raiders killed her husband.{{sfn|Suzuki|2013|p=214}} Another notable case was that of  Marzuq who was kidnapped from [[Makran]] and sold in [[Sharjah]]. Marzuq was purchased by Rashid bin Ali who had sex with her. When she became pregnant he married her off to another Baluchi to avoid taking responsibility for the child.{{sfn|Suzuki|2013|p=218}} Many slave owners arranged  marriages for their female slaves, just so they would not have to take responsibility for impregnating their slaves.{{sfn|Suzuki|2013|p=219}}\n\n===South Asia===\nThe most widespread [[raptio]] in modern times was the [[Violence against women during the partition of India|kidnapping of tens of thousands of girls during the Partition of India]].{{sfn|Collins|1975|p=336}} These women were kept as captives or forced wives{{sfn|Khan|2007|p=135}} and concubines.{{sfn|Khan|2007|p=39}} For instance, one account from Kirpal Singh mentions how [[Pakistan Army|Pakistani soldiers]] in Kamoke took 50 Hindu girls after killing most of their men.{{sfn|D'Costa|2010|p=57-58}} After being taken, Hindu and Sikh girls would be forcibly converted to Islam to be \"worthy\" of their captors' harems.{{sfn|Collins|1975|p=336}} [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] tribesmen captured a large number of non-Muslim girls from Kashmir and sold them as slave-girls in [[West Punjab]].{{sfn|Major|1995|p=62}} In [[Mirpur District|Mirpur]], many of the Hindu women captured by Pakistani soldiers committed jauhar, the old practice of Hindu women to escape Muslim soldiers.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bal K.

Legal and literary documents show that those slaves used for sexual service were differentiated at slave markets from those who were intended mainly for domestic services. These slave girls were called \"slaves for pleasure\" (mu\u1e6d\u02bfa, ladhdha) or \u201cslave-girls for sexual intercourse\u201d (jaw\u0101r\u012b al-wa\u1e6d). Many female slaves became concubines to their owners and bore their children. Others were just used for sex before being transferred. The allowance for men to use contraception with female slaves assisted in thwarting unwanted pregnancies.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=196\u2013197}} \n\nEarly sources indicate that [[Sexual slavery|sexual slavery]] of women was viewed as both a male privilege and a privilege for the victor over the defeated. Islamic legal texts state that sexual pleasure was a male privilege over women. Men were permitted to have as many concubines as they could afford. Some men purchased female slaves, whereas [[Muslims|Muslim]] soldiers in the [[Early Muslim conquests|early Islamic conquests]] were given female captives as a reward for military participation. As the slaves for pleasure were typically more expensive, they were a privilege for elite men.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=203}}\n==Islamic legal sanction==\nIn Islam, it is the male's ownership of a woman's [[Vagina|sexual organs]] which makes sex licit. [[Faq\u012bh|Islamic jurists]] also describe marriage as a kind of sale where the wife's private parts are purchased. However, there are some differences between the rights of a [[wife]] and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}} The term ''suriyya'' (concubine) was used for female slaves with whom masters enjoyed sexual relations. It was not a secure status as the [[Concubinage|concubine]] could be traded as long as the master had not impregnated her.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=51}}\n\nIslamic law and Sunni ulama recognise two categories of concubines:{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=22}}\n*War Captives: \n**These are originally free non-Muslims who are captured in battle.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}{{sfn|Badawi|2019|p=17}} The entire population of a conquered territory can be enslaved, thus providing women who are otherwise rare on the battlefield. This paves the path for concubinage.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27}} The Muslim military commander is allowed to choose between unconditionally releasing, ransoming or enslaving war captives.{{sfn|Mufti|2019|p=5}} If a person converted to Islam after being enslaved, their emancipation would be considered a pious act but not obligatory.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=22}} Islamic law does not allow enslavement of free-born Muslims.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=142}}\n**Islamic jurists permitted slave raiding and kidnapping of non-Muslims from Dar al Harb.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27-28}} South Asian scholars ruled that jihad was not needed to seize non-muslims nor was it necessary to invite them to Islam before seizing them. Raiders were free to take and enslave any non-muslim.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=28}} However, Shafi'i jurists held that non-muslims who had formal pacts with Muslims were to be protected from enslavement.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27-28}} \n*Slave-girls by descent: \n**These are born to slave mothers.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=22}} Owners who would marry off their female slaves to someone else, would also be the masters of any children born from that marriage.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=57}} Thus, Islamic law made slave-breeding possible.{{sfn|Erdem|1996|p=52}}\n\nThe concubines were owned by their masters. The owners could obtain the slave-girls through purchase, capture or receive them as a gift.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} Islam permits men to have sexual intercourse with them and there is no limit on the number of concubines they could keep, unlike in [[Polygyny in Islam|polygamy]] where there is a limit of four wives.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=243}} The master could also sell her or gift her to someone else. The female slave was essentially a chattel. An owner's slave could also be inherited by an heir.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245}} While she was under her master's control the slave girl could not have sex with anyone else.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}}\n\n==The issue of consent==\nThe classical Islamic jurists make an analogy between the marriage contract and sale of concubines. They state that the factor of male ownership in both is what makes sex lawful with both a wife and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}}\n\nThe [[Hanafi]] scholars allow the husband to have sex with his wife against her will, as long as he has paid her dowry.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=83}} The [[Shafi\u2018i|Shafi'i]], [[Maliki]] and [[Hanbali]] schools do not forbid a husband from forcing his wife to have sex nor do they expressly say anything in favour of it. For all Sunni law schools the concept of marital rape is an oxymoron.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=120}} According to the Islamic jurists, rape is either a kind of zina or a property crime, which by definition cannot be committed by a husband or master, since he is the owner of his wife and slave's sexual capacity.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149-150}}\n\nThere is no requirement in any of the Sunni law schools for the master to have his female slave's consent before he has sex with her.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=148}} A slave, by legal definition, does not have the capacity to refuse consent.{{sfn|Seedat|2016|p=34}} The Hanafis explicitly state that a man may force the woman to sexually satisfy him.{{sfn|Nancy|2009|quote=The followers of Imam Abu Hanifah said: \"The right of the sexual pleasure belongs to the man, not the woman, by that it is meant that the man has the right to force the woman to gratify himself sexually.}} It is mentioned in Kitab al-Maghazi that [[Uthman|Uthman ibn Affan]] had sexual intercourse with a war captive, Zaynab bint Hayyan, and that she \"detested\" him.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\n[[Muhammad]] and his Companions took for granted the allowance of having sex with female war captives. The consent of the women was irrelevant. Some modern Muslim writers seek to defend Islam by claiming that Islam permits men to have sex with female captives as a way of integrating them into society.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=60}} But in the case of the women from the [[Banu Mustaliq]] tribe who were captured by the [[Companions of the Prophet|Companions]], their captors wanted to practice [[coitus interruptus]] during sex with them because if these women became pregnant their captors would not be able to return them in exchange for ransom. According to Kecia Ali, modern Muslim scholarship is silent on the question  of what it means to accept that Muhammad implicitly permitted Muslim soldiers to rape the female captives.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=61}}\n\nAll four law schools also have a consensus that the master can marry off his female slave to someone else without her consent.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A master can also practice coitus interruptus during sex with his female slave without her permission.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A man having sex with someone else's female slave constitutes [[zina]].{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}} According to [[Imam Shafi'i]] if someone other than the master coerces a slave-girl to have sex, the rapist will be required to pay compensation to her master.{{sfn|Ali|2011|p=76}} If a man  marries off his own female slave and has sex with her even though he is then no longer allowed to have sexual intercourse with her, that sex is still considered a lesser offence than zina and the jurists say he must not be punished. It is noteworthy that while formulating this ruling, it is the slave woman's marriage and not her consent which is an issue.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}}\n\n==Sexual enslavement, the concept of honour and humiliation==\nEnslavement was intended both as a debt and form of [[humiliation]]. The sexual relationship between a concubine and her master was viewed as a debt of humiliation upon the woman until she gave birth to her master's child and the master's later death.{{sfn|Willis|2014}} Becoming a slave meant losing one's [[honour]] and one's rights.{{sfn|McMahon|2013|p=18}} The ulama asserted that slavery was a divine punishment for not being a Muslim. In the words of az-Aziz b.Ahmad al-Bukhari \"servitude is a vestige of obstinacy in refusing to believe in one God\". [[Al-Sharif al-Jurjani]] stated that slavery in Islamic law was a \"penalty for unbelief.\" An Algerian scholar who lived in Morocco, [[Ahmad al-Wansharisi]], described the purpose of slavery as a \"humiliation\" for previous or continuing disbelief.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27}}\n\n==Umm Walad (slave mother)==\n''Umm walad'' (mother of child) is a title given to a woman who gave birth to her master's child.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} If a female slave gave birth to her master's child she still remained a slave. However, the master would no longer be allowed to sell her. She would also become free once he died. The Sunni law schools disagree on the concubine's entitlement to this status. Many Maliki jurists ruled that the concubine becomes entitled to the status of ''umm walad'' even if her master does not acknowledge that the child is his. However, Hanafi jurists state that the ''umm walad'' status is contingent on the master acknowledging paternity of the child. If he does not accept that he is the father of the child then both the mother and child remain slaves.{{sfn|Brockopp|2000|p=195\u2013196}}\n\n==Forced conversion for concubinage==\nMost traditional scholars require the conversion of a [[Paganism|pagan]] slave-girl before sex, even through force if necessary.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176\u2013177}} The majority of jurists do not allow sexual intercourse with Zoroastrian or pagan female captives. They require a conversion of these women before sex can take place. [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal|Ibn Hanbal]] allowed sexual intercourse with pagan and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] female captives if they are forced to become Musim. Many traditions state that the female captives should be forced to accept Islam if they do not convert willingly. [[Hasan al-Basri]] narrates that Muslims would achieve this objective through various methods. They would order the Zoroastrian slave-girl to face the [[qibla]]h, utter the [[shahada]] and perform [[Wudu|wudhu]]. Her captor would then have sex with her after one menstrual cycle. However, others add the condition that the slave-girl must be taught to pray and purify herself before the master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=107}}\n\nThe scholars significantly lower the threshold of conversion for the girls so that the master may be able to have sex with her as soon as possible. Only a few early scholars permitted sex with pagan and Zoroastrian slaves girls without conversion.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=108}} Al-Mujahid and Safiid bin al-Musayyab say the master can still have sex with his Zoroastrian or pagan female slave even if she refuses to convert.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176-177}}\n\n[[Al-Shafi\u2018i|Imam Shafi'i]] claims that the Companions of Muhammad did not have sexual intercourse with Arab captives until they converted to Islam.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=177}} But [[Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya|Ibn Qayyim]] argues that the Companions of the Prophet had sexual intercourse with Arab captives, such as the women of the Banu Mustaliq tribe, without making the sex conditional on the conversion of the women. He also asserted that no tradition required the conversion of a slave-girl before her master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=178}}\n\n==Sexual slavery in Pre-Islamic Arabia and Early Islam==\nThe pre-Islamic Arabs used to practice [[female infanticide]]. They would bury their daughters alive upon birth. One of the motivations for fathers burying their daughters alive was the fear that when they grew up an enemy tribe could take them captive and dishonour them.{{sfn|Giladi|1990|p=192}}{{sfn|Munir|2005|p=192}} A study of the Arab genealogical text Nasab Quraysh records the maternity of 3,000 [[Quraysh|Quraishi]] tribesmen, most of whom lived in between 500 and 750 CE.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=11}} The data shows that there was a massive increase in the number of children born to concubines with the emergence of Islam.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=11}} An analysis of the data found that no children were born from concubines before the generation of Muhammad's grandfather.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=16}} There were a few cases of children being born from concubines before Muhammad but they were only in his father's and grandfather's generation. The analysis of the data thus showed that concubinage was not common before the time of Muhammad, but increased for men of his generation as a result of military conquests.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=17}} Due to these conquests, a large number of female slaves were available to the conquerors. Although there were more births, the attitude towards children born from slaves still remained negative.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=12}}  Some early Arab Muslims discriminated against those people who were born fron non-Arab female slaves. However, there is no indication that these attitudes were ever acted upon.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=20-21}}\n\nOne of the earliest surviving Christian texts from the Islamic period in Syria, dated by scholars to around 640 CE, describes the rise of Islam in this way: \n\n{{quote|They take the wife away from her husband and slay him like a sheep. They throw the babe from her mother and drive her into slavery; the child calls out from the ground and the mother hears, yet what is she to do?...They separate the children from the mother like the soul from within the body, and she watches as they divide her loved ones from off her lao, two of them go to two masters, herself to another[...] Her children cry out in lament, their eyes hot with tears. She turns to her loved ones, milk pouring forth from her breast: \"Go in peace, my darlings, and may God accompany you.\"|[[Seeing Islam As Others Saw It: A Survey and Evaluation of Christian, Jewish and Zoroastrian Writings on Early Islam]], [[Robert G. Hoyland]]{{sfn|Hoyland|1997|p=262}}}}\n\n===Women of Hawazin===\nThe Banu [[Thaqif]] and Banu [[Hawazin]] tribes decided to go to war against Muhammad under the leadership of Malik ibn Awf.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=259}} Malik had the unfortunate idea of bringing the women, children and livestock with his army.{{sfn|Saron|1986|p=266}} He believed that by bringing their women and children with the army, all his soldiers would fight more courageously to defend them.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=259}} When Muhammad was informed that the Hawazin had brought their women, children and livestock with them, he smiled and said \"Inshaa Allah, all these will become the booty of war for the Muslims.\"{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=260-261}}\n\nThe Muslim army defeated the Hawazin and captured their women and children. The pagan soldiers fled.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=262}} The war booty which the Muslims obtained was 24,000 camels, more than 40,000 goats, 160,000 dirhams worth of silver and 6,000 women and children.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=263}} Muhammad waited ten days for the Hawazin to repent and reclaim their families and properties. However, none of them came. Finally, Muhammad distributed the war booty among the Muslim soldiers.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=264}} The Muslim soldiers initially hesitated to have sex with the married female captives, until a verse was revealed giving them permission to have sex with them:<ref>{{cite book|author=\u0623\u0628\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0641\u062f\u0627\u0621 \u0625\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0639\u064a\u0644 \u0628\u0646 \u0639\u0645\u0631/\u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0645\u0634\u0642\u064a|title=THE EXEGESIS OF THE GRAND HOLY QUR'AN 1-4 Ibn Katheer VOL 2: \u062a\u0641\u0633\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631 &#91;\u0627\u0646\u0643\u0644\u064a\u0632\u064a&#93; 1/4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MCxuDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA41|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Dar Al Kotob Al Ilmiyah \u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0629|pages=40\u201341|id=GGKEY:47J6TBSZ6R8}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said, \"We captured some women from the area of Awtas who were already married, and we disliked having sexual relations with them because they already had husbands. So, we asked the Prophet about this matter, and this Ayah (verse) was revealed, Also (forbidden are) women already married, except those whom your right hands possess). Consequently, we had sexual relations with these women.\"</blockquote>\n\nMuhammad gave a girl called Zaynab bint Hayyan to Uthman ibn Affan. Uthman had sexual intercourse with her and she detested him. A woman was given to [['Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf|Abdurrahman ibn Awf]]. He resisted having sexual intercourse with her until her menses were over and then he had sex with her by virtue of her being his property. Jubayr bin Mu'tim also received a slave girl, who was not impregnated. [[Talhah|Talha ibn Ubaydullah]] had sexual intercourse with the female captive given to him. [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah|Abu Ubaydah ibn Jarrah]] impregnated the slave girl he was given.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\nA delegation from the Hawazin tribe came to Muhammad and converted to Islam. Once they had given allegiance to Muhammad they asked about their captured families and property. They said \"Those who you have brought as captives are our mothers, sisters and aunts and they alone bring disgrace to peoples. O Prophet, we ask for your kindness and gerosity. Free our women.\" Muhammad gave them a choice between reclaiming their property or their women and children.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=267}} The Hawazin tribesmen responded that if they had to choose between reclaiming their property or their honour, they would choose their honour (their womenfolk).{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}}\n\nMuhammad returned their women and children to them.{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}} The girl who had been given to Abdurrahman ibn Awf was given a choice to stay with him or return to her family. She chose her family. Likewise, the girls given to Talha, Uthman, [[Abdullah ibn Umar|Ibn Umar]] and Safwan bin Umayya were also returned to their families. However, the girl who had been given to [[Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas|Saad ibn Abi Waqas]] chose to stay with him. Uyanya had taken an old woman. Her son approached him to ransom her for 100 camels. The old woman asked her son why would he pay a 100 camels when Uyanya would leave her anyway without taking ransom. This angered Uyanya.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=466}}\n\n==Overview of slave-concubines' experiences==\nBecoming a concubine for her master could translate to gaining security and standing and other material benefits. If she bore her master a child and if he accepted paternity she could obtain the position of an umm walad. If she bacame an umm walad her daily life would probably resemble that of a free wife, but with a lower position. There are many instances of slave concubines in Muslim history who rose to positions of great influence. However, this position did not lighten the suffering that the slaves experienced in their lives. Many of them had been forcibly taken from their homes and permanently separated from their families. They were displayed at slave markets and humiliated and subjected to forced labour, forced marriages and sex.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}}\n\nMany slaves went through a period of distress, when they were first enslaved, which was typically a violent occasion. Between the 800s and 1200s the four main ways to enslave a person were kidnapping, slave raids, piracy, and poverty. Islamic law only gave female slaves protection from sexual exploitation by anyone who was not their owner.

While some idealise the lives of elite female slaves, many in practice suffered from abuse by both their owners and others.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because bearing her master's child could lead to freedom for a slave-girl, some female slaves had a motive to have sex with their owners. This angered the master's wives who would often punish such slaves.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}} The most regular opposition to concubinage came from free wives. Early moral stories depicted wives as victims of concubinage.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=81}}\n\nThe female slaves were traded as chattel.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because female slaves were traded among men and many of them had been owned by up to thirty men consecutively, they had a great deal of knowledge about sexual intercourse and were able to tutor elite adolescent males about sexual techniques.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}} Slave girls were seen as sexual commodities and were not allowed to cover themselves.{{sfn|Kamrava|2011|p=193}} Before being bought many women's bodies were examined. The Hanafis allowed potential male buyers to uncover and touch a female slave's arms, breasts and legs.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=218}} [[Umar]] prohibited slave girls from resembling free women and forbade them from covering their hair.{{sfn|El Fadl|2014|p=198}} Slave women did not veil and like prostitutes were exempt from a lot of the gender restrictions upon upper-class women. If a slave fornicated she also received less punishment than a respectable woman.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=81}}\n\nThe most fortunate female captives were women like [[Safiyya bint Huyayy|Safiyya]] and [[Juwayriyya bint al-Harith|Juwayriah]] who were freed from slavery and married Muhammad. The lives of female captives depended on whether her tribe could ransom her or if her captor chose to marry her. If neither of the two happened such women suffered because their captors owned their bodies and lives. If they were unattractive the captors would keep them as servants and if they were beautiful the captors were allowed to keep them as their concubines. The captors were also allowed to sell her. Due to this some female captives committed suicide.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}} There is an account of a woman called Sakhra, who was a female captive from the [[Banu Amir]] tribe. She committed suicide by throwing herself to the ground from a camel.{{sfn|Jones|1981|p=16}}\n\n==Socio-economic variations in historical concubinage==\nWhile Muslim cultures acknowledged concubinage, as well as a polygamy, as a man's legal right, in reality these were usually practiced only by the royalty and elite sections of society.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203}} The most highly desired slave-concubines in the Muslim world were not African women, but white girls, typically of Circassian or Georgian origin. However, they were very expensive.{{sfn|Miers|1975|p=56}} The large-scale availability of women for sexual slavery had a strong influence on Muslim thought, even though the \"[[harem]]\" culture of the elite was not mirrored by most of the Muslim population.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=52}} \n===Abbasid Caliphate===\nThe royals and nobles during the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] kept large numbers of concubines.

The Caliph [[al-Mutawakkil]] was reported to own 4,000 concubines.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=89}}\n\n===Andalusia===\nIn Muslim society in general, [[monogamy]] was common because keeping multiple wives and concubines was not affordable for many households.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=155}} The practice of keeping concubines was common in the Muslim upper class. Muslim rulers preferred having children with concubines because it helped them avoid the social and political complexities arising from marriage and kept their lineages separate from the other lineages in society.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}} One Umayyad ruler, [[Abd al-Rahman III]], was known to have possessed more than 6000 concubines.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=89}}\n\n===Ottoman Empire===\nThe [[Ottoman Sultans|Ottoman rulers]] would keep hundreds, even thousands, of concubines. Female war captives were often turned into concubines for the Ottoman rulers. Ambitious slave families associated with the palace would also frequently offer their daughters up as concubines.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203-204}} Slave traders would abduct and sell [[Circassians|Circassian]] girls.{{sfn|Yelbasi|2019|p=14}} Circassian and [[Georgians|Georgian]] women were systematically trafficked to eastern harems. This practice lasted into the 1890s.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203-204}} [[Fynes Moryson]] noted that some Muslim men would keep their wives in various cities while others would keep them in a single house and would keep adding as many women as their lusts permitted. He wrote that \"They buy free women to be their wives, or they buy \"conquered women\" at a lesser price to be their concubines.\"{{sfn|Witte|2015|p=283}} Ottoman society had provided avenues for men who wished to have extramarital sex. They could either marry more wives while wealthy men could possess slaves and use them for sex.{{sfn|Kia|2011|p=206}}\n\nSince the late 1300s Ottoman sultans would only permit heirs born from concubines to inherit their throne. Each concubine was only permitted to have one son. Once a concubine would bear a son she would spend the rest of her life plotting in favour of her son. If her son was to successfully become the next Sultan, she would become an unquestionable ruler. After the 1450s the Sultans stopped marrying altogether. Because of this there was great surprise when Sultan Sulayman fell in love with his concubine and married her. An Ottoman Sultan would have sexual relationships with only some women from his large collection of slave girls. This meant that a lot of the concubines were not given a family life if they were not desired by the Sultan. This effectively meant these women would have to spend the rest of their lives in virtual imprisonment. Some of these women would break the sharia by having [[Lesbian|homosexual]] relations.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=89}}\n\nResearch into Ottoman records show that polygamy was absent or rare in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.{{sfn|Irwin|2010|p=531}} Concubinage and polygamy were quite uncommon outside the elite.

However, some kept Abyssinian slaves who were less costly than maintaining a wife. While white slave-girls would be in the keep of wealthy Turks, the concubines kept by upper and middle class Egyptians were usually Abyssinians.{{sfn|Lewis|1992|p=74}}\n\n===Indian subcontinent===\nOvington, a voyager who wrote about his journey to [[Surat]], stated that Muslim men had an \"extraordinary liberty for women\" and kept as many concubines as they could afford.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=59}} [[Akbar]] had a harem of at least 5000 women and [[Aurangzeb]]'s harem was even larger.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=354}} The nobles in India could possess as many concubines as they wanted.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=357}} Ismail Quli Khan, a Mughal noble, possessed 1200 girls.

If he felt attracted to any slave-girl he would call her to him for his enjoyment while the wife would not dare to show her anger. The wife would punish the slave-girl later.{{sfn|Lal|2005|p=40}}\n\nLower class Muslims were generally monogamous. Since they hardly had any rivals, women of the lower and middle class sections of society fared better than upper-class women who had to contend with their husbands' other wives, slave-girls and concubines.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=61}} Shireen Moosvi has discovered Muslim marriage contracts from Surat, dating back to the 1650s. One stipulation in these [[Nikah|marriage contracts]] was that the husband was not to marry a second wife. Another stipulation was that the husband would not take a slave girl. These stipulations were common among middle-class Muslims in Surat. If the husband took a second wife the first wife would gain an automatic right of divorce, thus indicating the preference for monogamy among the merchants of Surat. If the husband took a slave-girl the wife could sell, free or give away that slave-girl, thereby separating the female slave from her husband.{{sfn|Faroqhi|2019|p=244}}\n\nThere is no evidence that concubinage was practiced in [[Kashmir]] where, unlike the rest of the medieval Muslim world, slavery was abhorred and not widespread.

Many of these had been captured in raids or wars and were then gifted to the elite Muslim soldiers as war booty or were sold as slaves in Muslim markets.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}} [[Berbers|Berber]] pirates trafficked [[French people|French]], [[Italians|Italian]], [[Spaniards|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] women to North Africa. Christian females were enslaved more than any other religious demographic.{{sfn|Capern|2019|p=22}} It is difficult to track down the experienced of European female slaves because they would have accounted for 5 percent of the slaves trafficked to North Africa and even fewer women were freed from slavery than men between the 16th and 19th centuries. During those centuries, at least 50,000 to 75,000 [[Europeans|European]] girls were forcibly taken and most of them never returned home.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=57}} One male [[English people|English]] slave narrated an account of a young English girl who was given as concubine to the Moroccan king, [[Ismail Ibn Sharif|Mulley Ismail]]. She tried to resist his sexual advances. He then ordered his black slaves to whip and torture her until she gave in.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=58}}\n\nEnslaved European men also narrated accounts of women who \"apostasised.\" The life stories of these women were similar to [[Hurrem Sultan|Roxelana]], who rose from being a Christian slave-girl into the chief advisor of her husband, [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Sultan Suleyman]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. There are several accounts of  such women of humble birth who associated with powerful Muslim men. While the associations were initially forced, the captivity gave women a taste for access to power. Diplomats wrote with disappointment about apostate women who wielded political influence over their masters-turned-husbands. Christian male slaves also recorded the presence of authoritative convert women in Muslim families. [[Christians|Christian]] women who converted to Islam and then became politically assertive and tyrannical were regarded by Europeans as traitors to the faith.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=59}} Enslaved Christian women lost all hope of returning home through ransom once they entered a Muslim household. The women were forced to enter a life of sexual subjugation to their new husbands. There is also evidence that many \"privileged\" female captives wanted to escape if they were given the chance. There is an account of an [[Irish people|Irish]] mother who attacked her [[Algerians|Algerian]] male captors when she learnt that her enslavement meant that she was going to be separated from her children forever. She was later subdued.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=60}}\n\nThe [[Delhi Sultanate|Muslim Sultanates]] in India before the Mughal Empire captured large numbers of non-Muslims from the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]. The Muslim masters would impregnate their non-Muslim slaves and the children they fathered would be raised as Muslims. Non-Muslim girls were socially ostracised by their own communities for the sexual relationships Muslim soldiers and nobles would have with them, therefore, many of them preferred to convert to Islam.{{sfn|Hardy|1972|p=9}} When Muslims would surround [[Rajput]] citadels, the Rajput women would commit [[jauhar]] (collective suicide) to save themselves from being dishonoured by their enemies.

The capture and enslavement of non-muslim women is described in a matter-of-fact way in the Muslim sources. However, the same practice was criticised when Christians captured Muslim women. In the eleventh century Christians began an aggressive policy towards Muslims in Andalus. Christian military leaders captured Muslim women and included eight year old Muslim [[Virginity|virgins]] as part of their war booty.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=171}} When [[Granada]] passed from Muslim rule to Christian rule, thousands of Moorish women were enslaved and trafficked to Europe.{{sfn|Capern|2019|p=22}} Muslim families tried to ransom their daughters, mothers and wives who had been captured and enslaved.{{sfn|Salzmann|2013|p=397}} Muslim women were kept as concubines by Christian men.<ref>{{cite book|author=Margaret C.

However, Muslims have still at times enslaved Muslims from other ethnic groups.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=53}} The [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] caliph [[Muhammad II of C\u00f3rdoba]] gave orders that the Berber houses in [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|Cordoba]] be looted and that Berber women be captured and sold in Dar-al Banat.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=166}} In another case the Andalusian ruler of [[M\u00e1laga|Malaga]], Ibn Hassun, unsuccessfully attempted to kill his female relatives before the Berber [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads]] could capture them.

The atrocities of [[Alauddin Khalji|Alauddin Khilji]] on women have been documented in [[Tabaqat-i-Akbari]] by [[Nizamuddin Ahmad]].  [[Khusrau Khan]] humiliated [[Qutbuddin Mubarak Shah|Sultan Qutb ud din Mubarak]] by marrying his widow and allowing Hindus to take away his other female relatives. [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abu Fazl]] records atrocities by [[Kamran Mirza|Kamran]] on the female relatives of [[Humayun]]'s supporters. [[Sher Shah Suri|Sher Shah]] was reported to have sold the wives of rebellious zamindars.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=64}}\n\n[[Kurds]] in the Ottoman-Persian frontier would enslave both Shias and Yazidis. The Ottoman jurist [[Ebussuud Efendi|Ebu Su'ud]] upheld the permissibility of wars against the Shia but he forbade the taking of Shias as captives. In particular, he also declared that sexual intercourse with Shia female captives was unlawful. However, he endorsed enslavement of Shias in a later fatwa.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=43}} In 1786-7 an Ottoman general enslaved the wives and children of [[Mamluk]] emirs.

However, Kecia Ali states that this view is not found anywhere in the pre-modern Islamic legal tradition.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=148}} \n===Abolition===\nColonial governments and independent Muslim states restricted slave raids and the slave trade in response to pressure from Western liberals and weak Muslim abolitionist movements. Eliminating slavery was an even more difficult task. Many Muslim governments refused to sign the international treaties against slavery which the [[League of Nations]] was co-ordinating since 1926. This refusal was also an issue at the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and at the [[Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery|1956 Anti-Slavery Convention]].{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=11}} It was mostly because of the pressure from European colonial powers and economic changes that slavery was abolished. White the institution was eventually abolished, there was no internally well-developed Islamic narrative against slave-ownership.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=54}}\n\nA group of ulama led by Waji al-Din Saharanpuri gave a fatwa in the 1830s that it was lawful to enslave men and women \"who sought refuge\" after battle. Sayyed Imdad Ali Akbarabadi led ulama in publishing a lot of material in defence of traditional kinds of slavery. Sayyid Muhammad Askari condemned the idea of abolishing slavery. A conservative [[Deobandi]] scholar published a book in [[Lahore]] in 1946 in which he denied that the Prophet had ever encouraged the abolition of slavery.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=135}} [[Armenians]] and other Christian rebels who had been enslaved in [[World War I]] were considered to be \"people of the book\" who had violated their contract. Hence, one [[Palestinian]] shaykh ruled that Muslims could buy those Christian girls from the slave markets in the Levant.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=141-142}}\n\nIn the 19th century some ulama in Cairo refused to allow slave girls, who had been freed under secular law, to marry unless they had obtained permission from their owner.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=138}} Most ulama in [[West Africa]] opposed abolition.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=144-145}} They ruled that concubinage was still allowed with women of slave descent.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=145}} In 1911 one Qadi ruled that no government can free a slave without the owner's permission.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=146}} [[J.

The wish to enslave enemies and take concubines was noted in the [[Punjab Disturbances Court of Inquiry|Munir Commission Report]]. When [[Zia ul Haq]] came to power in 1977 and started applying sharia, some argued that the reward for freeing slaves meant that slavery should not be abolished \"since to do so would be to deny future generations the opportunity to commit the virtuous deed of freeing slaves.\"{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=189}} [[Muhammad Taqi Usmani|Mufti Taqi Usmani]] states that slavery and turning captives into concubines is still allowed by Islam.

In 1981 a group of ulama argued that only owners could free their slaves and that the Mauritanian government was breaking a fundamental religious rule. In 1997 one [[Mauritanian]] scholar stated that abolition:{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=147}}\n\n<blockquote>\"is contrary to the teachings of the fundamental text of Islamic law, the Koran... [and] amounts to the expropriation from Muslims of their gods, goods that were acquired legally. The state, if it is Islamic, does not have the right to seize my house, my wife or my slave.\"</blockquote>\n\nIn response to the enslavement of [[Yazidis|Yazidi]] women by [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] the [[Council on American\u2013Islamic Relations|Council on American-Islamic Relations]] and Fiqh Council of North America claimed that no scholar disputes the abolition of slavery was one of the aims of Islam. However, [[Kecia Ali]] finds this claim dishonest. While there was definitely  an \u201cemancipatory ethic\u201d (encouragement for freeing slaves) in Islamic jurisprudence, slavery was never actually abolished.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=6}} The translator of [[Ibn Kathir]]'s treatise on slaves, Umar ibn Sulayman Hafyan, felt obliged to explain why he published a slave treatise when [[slavery]] no longer exists. He states that just because slavery no longer exists does not mean that the laws about slavery have been abrogated. Moreover, slavery was only abolished half a century ago and could return in the future.  His comments were a reflection of the predicament modern Muslims find themselves in.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=304}}\n\n==Modern manifestations==\n===Middle East===\nArmenians underwent a [[Armenian Genocide|genocide]] in the Ottoman Empire, which climaxed around 1915-16. It has been accepted as the first  genocide of the 20th century by scholars of genocide and historians of the late Ottoman period.{{sfn|Sjoberg|2016|p=90}} The Ottomans had intended to destroy the Armenians.{{sfn|Eltringham|2014|p=14}} Derderuan notes that after being separated from their men who were killed, the Armenian women and children were raped, forcibly converted to Islam and subjected to sexual slavery. [[Eliz Sanasarian]] also notes the involvement of Turkish women in perpetrating violence against Armenian women by selling them into sexual slavery.{{sfn|Sjoberg|2016|p=91}} Women who were deemed beautiful were sold as sex slaves to military officials. The remaining women would be beaten and raped.{{sfn|Crawford|2017|p=13}} The women were also often forced into prostitution or forcibly married with non-Armenians.{{sfn|Demirdjian|2016|p=126}} Kidnapped Armenian girls were sorted on the basis of their age, beauty and marital status. The \"first choice\" was given to high-level Ottoman officials. Outside [[Mezre]], purchasers asked doctors to check the girls for diseases and to verify their virginity. One German reported the sale of girls in [[Ras al-Ayn]] and testified that the policemen carried out the trade in girls.{{sfn|Connellan|2017|p=141}} A few slave markers were set up in the vicinity of government buildings while Armenian captive sex slaves were kept in the Red Crescent Hospital in Trebizond.{{sfn|Connellan|2017|p=141-142}}\n\nA large number of free [[Baloch people|Baloch]] women were kidnapped in the first half of the 20th century by slave traders and sold across the [[Persian Gulf]]. For example, Yuri bint Lapek was abducted after raiders killed her husband.{{sfn|Suzuki|2013|p=214}} Another notable case was that of  Marzuq who was kidnapped from [[Makran]] and sold in [[Sharjah]]. Marzuq was purchased by Rashid bin Ali who had sex with her. When she became pregnant he married her off to another Baluchi to avoid taking responsibility for the child.{{sfn|Suzuki|2013|p=218}} Many slave owners arranged  marriages for their female slaves, just so they would not have to take responsibility for impregnating their slaves.{{sfn|Suzuki|2013|p=219}}\n\n===South Asia===\nThe most widespread [[raptio]] in modern times was the [[Violence against women during the partition of India|kidnapping of tens of thousands of girls during the Partition of India]].{{sfn|Collins|1975|p=336}} These women were kept as captives or forced wives{{sfn|Khan|2007|p=135}} and concubines.{{sfn|Khan|2007|p=39}} For instance, one account from Kirpal Singh mentions how [[Pakistan Army|Pakistani soldiers]] in Kamoke took 50 Hindu girls after killing most of their men.{{sfn|D'Costa|2010|p=57-58}} After being taken, Hindu and Sikh girls would be forcibly converted to Islam to be \"worthy\" of their captors' harems.{{sfn|Collins|1975|p=336}} [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] tribesmen captured a large number of non-Muslim girls from Kashmir and sold them as slave-girls in [[West Punjab]].{{sfn|Major|1995|p=62}} In [[Mirpur District|Mirpur]], many of the Hindu women captured by Pakistani soldiers committed jauhar, the old practice of Hindu women to escape Muslim soldiers.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bal K.
