Animation]], the tenth incarnation of [[Hanna-Barbera]]'s ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' franchise.<ref name=Perlmutter>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |pages=534-538}}</ref>\n\nThe show debuted on September 23, 2006, and ran for two seasons during the [[Kids' WB]] Saturday morning block of [[The CW|The CW Television Network]]. It was the final animated series produced by Hanna-Barbera's co-founder [[Joseph Barbera]] before his death. The second season premiered in Canada on [[Teletoon]] on September 6, 2008, and was also available online at Cartoon Network Online. It won 17 grammies and a couple of oscars and all together brung in an estimated 72.8 billion.\n\n==Production==\nThe characters have also been re-designed to look like animated versions of how they appeared in the [[Scooby-Doo (film)|live-action ''Scooby-Doo'' film]]. For instance, Scooby is drawn with dot eyes.  Thus, it is the third show in the Scooby-Doo series, after ''[[A Pup Named Scooby-Doo]]'' and followed by ''[[Be Cool, Scooby-Doo!]]'', that is not animated or drawn in the usual Hanna-Barbera style. This is also the first series in which [[Casey Kasem]] does not voice Shaggy, but is instead done by [[Scott Menville]], although [[Scott Innes]] or [[Billy West]] portrayed the character in many of the Scooby-Doo animated movies made for television or home video. However, in this series, Kasem does voice Shaggy's rich and on-the-run Uncle Albert. Another noticeable difference is that Shaggy now wears a white short-sleeved shirt with a green strip across the middle and green sleeves instead of his trademark green T-shirt. [[Frank Welker]] still does Scooby's voice. In addition, Shaggy and Scooby's cowardice tendencies have been considerably toned down and are shown to be quite skilled.\n\nMuch like ''[[The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo]]'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 1985 (which had actual ghosts and monsters) and the [[Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo (1980 TV series)|''Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo'' shorts]] in 1980, this show is different from the usual \"crooks masquerading as [[ghosts]] and [[monsters]]\" series. Fred Jones, Daphne Blake and Velma Dinkley are downgraded, but not completely absent as they were in the ''Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo'' shorts. They cameo in the first episode and have full guest appearances in another season one episode. Fred and Daphne appear as silent cameos in one season two episode when they were not allowed to Dr. Phibes's \"attractive people\" party. Their silhouettes run across the screen in the opening credits in amongst the silhouettes of all the show's regular cast, suggesting they were supposed to be primary characters at some point, but were downgraded in production.\n\n==Plot==\nThe premise of the show revolves around the fact that [[Shaggy Rogers]]' incredibly rich Uncle Albert Shaggleford disappears and names Shaggy as his sole heir for an inheritance.<ref>{{cite book |last1=O'Melia |first1=Gina |title=Japanese Influence on American Children's Television: Transforming Saturday Morning |date=2019 |publisher=Palmgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-3030174156 |page=49 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rAGiDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA49&dq=Shaggy+%26+Scooby-Doo+Get+a+Clue!&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiL2vumqK_oAhUyNX0KHfYABdkQ6AEwBHoECC0QAg#v=onepage&q=Shaggy%20%26%20Scooby-Doo%20Get%20a%20Clue!&f=false |accessdate=23 March 2020}}</ref> With the help of the inheritance, Shaggy has upgraded the [[Mystery Machine]], giving it the ability to transform itself into a number of other different vehicles, like the \"Hotdog Making Machine\".\n\nDr. Albert Shaggleford had made some enemies before disappearing. Among the most dangerous is the archetypal evil genius and [[technology]] [[pirate]] out to take over the world and or become [[Immortality|immortal]]\u2014Dr. Phineas Phibes (who gets his name from the [[Vincent Price]] villain ''[[The Abominable Dr. Phibes]]''). Dr. Phibes recruits other sidekicks and minions to help him with his plans, among them Dr. Trebla.\n\nIt appears that the supposedly late Dr. Shaggleford was, beyond being rich, an inventor in his own right, and his clueless young heir is now in possession of some very interesting [[nano technology]]. The top secret nanotech formula has been mixed in with [[Scooby Snacks]], which, when eaten, cause a variety of day-saving side effects.\n\nShaggy and Scooby-Doo have a mission: armed with an updated Mystery Machine, a loyal robot servant named Robi, their new riches, and the new and improved Scooby Snacks, they must stop the evil plans of Phineas Phibes and save the world. In episode 2, Shaggy upgrades the Mystery Machine from its original form, to a high-tech transforming vehicle. However, it usually transforms into machines inappropriate for the tasks at hand (however, in episode 11, it does transform into vehicles appropriate to finish the Polar Bear 3000). In their spare time, Shaggy and Scooby are fans of the show ''Chefs of Steel'', and the famous mystery solver Chad Chaddington.\n\n==Characters==\n{{main|List of Scooby-Doo characters}}\n===Main===\n* [[Shaggy Rogers|Norville \"Shaggy\" Rogers]] (voiced by [[Scott Menville]]): Shaggy is no longer a vegetarian in the series. \n* [[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby-Doo]] (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]): Shaggy's pet and best friend. He usually saves the day by consuming a nano-infused Scooby Snack which gives him an incredible power of some such.\n* Robi (voiced by [[Jim Meskimen]]): A loyal robotic servant of Shaggy and Scooby-Doo. He is either defective or a failed experimental butler, but either way he has a tendency to bust through walls and other highly destructive things without second thoughts. Robi would also have different uses for Shaggy and Scooby, though he is a rather lousy cook, various impressions, and giving out safety tips (in a style similar to ''[[Inspector Gadget (1983 TV series)|Inspector Gadget]]''). He also projects holograms of Uncle Albert when he wants to talk with Shaggy. Robi also usually calls Scooby \"Rooby Roo\" due to misunderstanding Scooby's voice.\n* Dr. Albert Shaggleford (voiced by [[Casey Kasem]]): Shaggy's rich uncle who is a genius inventor. He always sends a transmission to Shaggy from an undisclosed location on Phibes' doings. As of the final episode, it is revealed that he was undercover as Dr. Trebla all along (when you invert Trebla it is spelled Albert) and transmitting from Phibes' lair. He is allergic to [[peanut]]s.\n* Dr. Phineus Phibes (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]): The primary antagonist of the series. In his younger age, Phibes conducted a highly dangerous experiment with electricity, which cost him his left hand (he wears a [[prosthetic]] that seems to function as a high-tech [[Swiss Army knife]]) and makes him a living [[lightning rod]]\u2014hence, he seldom ventures outdoors, as doing so makes him susceptible to being struck by lightning, regardless of the weather. Producer [[Eric Radomski]] had this to say about Dr. Phibes: \"Dr. Phibes' exterior lair is deco influenced, and in the 13th episode, we introduce a feline friend of Dr. Phibes.  Ray DeLaurentis would need to confirm, but I believe your assumption is correct. Dr. Phibes is [[Hogan's Heros#Colonel Klink|Col. Klink]] plus [[Dr. Evil]] divided by [[Dr. Strangelove|Strangelove]].\"<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=80725]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070222080501/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=80725 |date=February 22, 2007 }}</ref>\n* Dr. Trebla (voiced by Scott Menville): Dr. Trebla is Dr. Phibes' right-hand man who gives him advice and sees to his needs like his constant companion. In the series finale he is revealed to have been Uncle Albert working undercover all along revealing how he could give info on Phibes regularly to Shaggy and Scooby.  A clue before this revelation is that his name is in fact Albert spelled backwards.\n* Agent 1 (voiced by [[Jim Meskimen]]): Agent 1 is serious and hates Shaggy and Scooby. He often works with Agent 2, much to his chagrin, and the second in command. Agent 1 is also the one never to believe what his agents ever tell him, until he sees proof, as seen in \"Zoinksman\". He is often told to smack Agent 2 when he annoys Dr. Phibes. He is the only one who is more easily annoyed by Agent 2 than Dr. Phibes is.\n* Agent 2 (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]): Agent 2 is a somewhat dimwitted and heavyset man who resents his [[feces|name]] and wishes to be called something else. Among other personas he's adopted was a ninja in \"High Society Scooby\" and a racer called Dr. Speed. In one episode, his real name is revealed to be Jeff, a reference on his voice actor's name.\n\n===Supporting===\n* Agent 3 (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]): Agent 3 is a timid, but honest agent.\n* Agent 4 (voiced by [[Scott Menville]]): Agent 4 is a strong agent.\n* Agent 13 (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]): Dr. Phibes' elderly father.\n* Ricky and Mark (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]] and [[Jim Meskimen]]): Dr. Phibes' \"techies.\" They are parodies of [[Napoleon Dynamite]] and his brother Kip Dynamite. They work for Dr. Phibes and make evil inventions for his own use. Even though they work for Dr. Phibes they will help Shaggy and Scooby if they need it.\n* Menace (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]): A super-strong villain who is Dr. Phibes' latest minion. After trying the nanotech formula, his strength was increased, but after a while, began to lose his mind. He developed a fondness for kittens (unfortunate for Dr. Phibes, who at the time had used some stolen nanotech to turn himself into a cat) and had smiley faces on his biceps. An obvious parody of [[Bane (comics)|Bane]].\n\n==Other features of the show==\nThis is the first Scooby-Doo animated series since 1991 to make extensive use of the [[Castle thunder (sound effect)|Castle Thunder]] sound effect, which Hanna-Barbera began to stop using around 1994, and was very rarely used on ''What's New, Scooby-Doo?'' and on none of the post-2003 direct-to-video Scooby-Doo movies, to be replaced with new digitally-recorded thunderclaps.\n\nIn episode 8, there is one scene where actual footage from a few of the Scooby-Doo direct-to-video movies is used. Shaggy even converses about the events in that movie.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a Clue! episodes}}\n{{Series overview\n| color1     = #F37C17\n| link1      = List of Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a Clue! episodes#Season 1 (2006\u201307)\n| episodes1  = 13\n| start1     = {{Start date|2006|9|23}}\n| end1       = {{Start date|2007|5|5}}\n\n| color2     = #009CF1\n| link2      = List of Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a Clue! episodes#Season 2 (2007\u201308)\n| episodes2  = 13\n| start2     = {{Start date|2007|9|22}}\n| end2       = {{Start date|2008|3|15}}\n}}\n\n==Home media==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n|+Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a Clue! home video releases\n! colspan=2 rowspan=2|Season\n! rowspan=2|Episodes\n! rowspan=2|Year active\n!

Animation]], the tenth incarnation of [[Hanna-Barbera]]'s ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' franchise.<ref name=Perlmutter>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |pages=534-538}}</ref>\n\nThe show debuted on September 23, 2006, and ran for two seasons during the [[Kids' WB]] Saturday morning block of [[The CW|The CW Television Network]]. It was the final animated series produced by Hanna-Barbera's co-founder [[Joseph Barbera]] before his death. The second season premiered in Canada on [[Teletoon]] on September 6, 2008, and was also available online at Cartoon Network Online.\n\n==Production==\nThe characters have also been re-designed to look like animated versions of how they appeared in the [[Scooby-Doo (film)|live-action ''Scooby-Doo'' film]]. For instance, Scooby is drawn with dot eyes.  Thus, it is the third show in the Scooby-Doo series, after ''[[A Pup Named Scooby-Doo]]'' and followed by ''[[Be Cool, Scooby-Doo!]]'', that is not animated or drawn in the usual Hanna-Barbera style. This is also the first series in which [[Casey Kasem]] does not voice Shaggy, but is instead done by [[Scott Menville]], although [[Scott Innes]] or [[Billy West]] portrayed the character in many of the Scooby-Doo animated movies made for television or home video. However, in this series, Kasem does voice Shaggy's rich and on-the-run Uncle Albert. Another noticeable difference is that Shaggy now wears a white short-sleeved shirt with a green strip across the middle and green sleeves instead of his trademark green T-shirt. [[Frank Welker]] still does Scooby's voice. In addition, Shaggy and Scooby's cowardice tendencies have been considerably toned down and are shown to be quite skilled.\n\nMuch like ''[[The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo]]'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 1985 (which had actual ghosts and monsters) and the [[Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo (1980 TV series)|''Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo'' shorts]] in 1980, this show is different from the usual \"crooks masquerading as [[ghosts]] and [[monsters]]\" series. Fred Jones, Daphne Blake and Velma Dinkley are downgraded, but not completely absent as they were in the ''Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo'' shorts. They cameo in the first episode and have full guest appearances in another season one episode. Fred and Daphne appear as silent cameos in one season two episode when they were not allowed to Dr. Phibes's \"attractive people\" party. Their silhouettes run across the screen in the opening credits in amongst the silhouettes of all the show's regular cast, suggesting they were supposed to be primary characters at some point, but were downgraded in production.\n\n==Plot==\nThe premise of the show revolves around the fact that [[Shaggy Rogers]]' incredibly rich Uncle Albert Shaggleford disappears and names Shaggy as his sole heir for an inheritance.<ref>{{cite book |last1=O'Melia |first1=Gina |title=Japanese Influence on American Children's Television: Transforming Saturday Morning |date=2019 |publisher=Palmgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-3030174156 |page=49 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rAGiDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA49&dq=Shaggy+%26+Scooby-Doo+Get+a+Clue!&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiL2vumqK_oAhUyNX0KHfYABdkQ6AEwBHoECC0QAg#v=onepage&q=Shaggy%20%26%20Scooby-Doo%20Get%20a%20Clue!&f=false |accessdate=23 March 2020}}</ref> With the help of the inheritance, Shaggy has upgraded the [[Mystery Machine]], giving it the ability to transform itself into a number of other different vehicles, like the \"Hotdog Making Machine\".\n\nDr. Albert Shaggleford had made some enemies before disappearing. Among the most dangerous is the archetypal evil genius and [[technology]] [[pirate]] out to take over the world and or become [[Immortality|immortal]]\u2014Dr. Phineas Phibes (who gets his name from the [[Vincent Price]] villain ''[[The Abominable Dr. Phibes]]''). Dr. Phibes recruits other sidekicks and minions to help him with his plans, among them Dr. Trebla.\n\nIt appears that the supposedly late Dr. Shaggleford was, beyond being rich, an inventor in his own right, and his clueless young heir is now in possession of some very interesting [[nano technology]]. The top secret nanotech formula has been mixed in with [[Scooby Snacks]], which, when eaten, cause a variety of day-saving side effects.\n\nShaggy and Scooby-Doo have a mission: armed with an updated Mystery Machine, a loyal robot servant named Robi, their new riches, and the new and improved Scooby Snacks, they must stop the evil plans of Phineas Phibes and save the world. In episode 2, Shaggy upgrades the Mystery Machine from its original form, to a high-tech transforming vehicle. However, it usually transforms into machines inappropriate for the tasks at hand (however, in episode 11, it does transform into vehicles appropriate to finish the Polar Bear 3000). In their spare time, Shaggy and Scooby are fans of the show ''Chefs of Steel'', and the famous mystery solver Chad Chaddington.\n\n==Characters==\n{{main|List of Scooby-Doo characters}}\n===Main===\n* [[Shaggy Rogers|Norville \"Shaggy\" Rogers]] (voiced by [[Scott Menville]]): Shaggy is no longer a vegetarian in the series. \n* [[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby-Doo]] (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]): Shaggy's pet and best friend. He usually saves the day by consuming a nano-infused Scooby Snack which gives him an incredible power of some such.\n* Robi (voiced by [[Jim Meskimen]]): A loyal robotic servant of Shaggy and Scooby-Doo. He is either defective or a failed experimental butler, but either way he has a tendency to bust through walls and other highly destructive things without second thoughts. Robi would also have different uses for Shaggy and Scooby, though he is a rather lousy cook, various impressions, and giving out safety tips (in a style similar to ''[[Inspector Gadget (1983 TV series)|Inspector Gadget]]''). He also projects holograms of Uncle Albert when he wants to talk with Shaggy. Robi also usually calls Scooby \"Rooby Roo\" due to misunderstanding Scooby's voice.\n* Dr. Albert Shaggleford (voiced by [[Casey Kasem]]): Shaggy's rich uncle who is a genius inventor. He always sends a transmission to Shaggy from an undisclosed location on Phibes' doings. As of the final episode, it is revealed that he was undercover as Dr. Trebla all along (when you invert Trebla it is spelled Albert) and transmitting from Phibes' lair. He is allergic to [[peanut]]s.\n* Dr. Phineus Phibes (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]): The primary antagonist of the series. In his younger age, Phibes conducted a highly dangerous experiment with electricity, which cost him his left hand (he wears a [[prosthetic]] that seems to function as a high-tech [[Swiss Army knife]]) and makes him a living [[lightning rod]]\u2014hence, he seldom ventures outdoors, as doing so makes him susceptible to being struck by lightning, regardless of the weather. Producer [[Eric Radomski]] had this to say about Dr. Phibes: \"Dr. Phibes' exterior lair is deco influenced, and in the 13th episode, we introduce a feline friend of Dr. Phibes.  Ray DeLaurentis would need to confirm, but I believe your assumption is correct. Dr. Phibes is [[Hogan's Heros#Colonel Klink|Col. Klink]] plus [[Dr. Evil]] divided by [[Dr. Strangelove|Strangelove]].\"<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=80725]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070222080501/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=80725 |date=February 22, 2007 }}</ref>\n* Dr. Trebla (voiced by Scott Menville): Dr. Trebla is Dr. Phibes' right-hand man who gives him advice and sees to his needs like his constant companion. In the series finale he is revealed to have been Uncle Albert working undercover all along revealing how he could give info on Phibes regularly to Shaggy and Scooby.  A clue before this revelation is that his name is in fact Albert spelled backwards.\n* Agent 1 (voiced by [[Jim Meskimen]]): Agent 1 is serious and hates Shaggy and Scooby. He often works with Agent 2, much to his chagrin, and the second in command. Agent 1 is also the one never to believe what his agents ever tell him, until he sees proof, as seen in \"Zoinksman\". He is often told to smack Agent 2 when he annoys Dr. Phibes. He is the only one who is more easily annoyed by Agent 2 than Dr. Phibes is.\n* Agent 2 (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]): Agent 2 is a somewhat dimwitted and heavyset man who resents his [[feces|name]] and wishes to be called something else. Among other personas he's adopted was a ninja in \"High Society Scooby\" and a racer called Dr. Speed. In one episode, his real name is revealed to be Jeff, a reference on his voice actor's name.\n\n===Supporting===\n* Agent 3 (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]): Agent 3 is a timid, but honest agent.\n* Agent 4 (voiced by [[Scott Menville]]): Agent 4 is a strong agent.\n* Agent 13 (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]): Dr. Phibes' elderly father.\n* Ricky and Mark (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]] and [[Jim Meskimen]]): Dr. Phibes' \"techies.\" They are parodies of [[Napoleon Dynamite]] and his brother Kip Dynamite. They work for Dr. Phibes and make evil inventions for his own use. Even though they work for Dr. Phibes they will help Shaggy and Scooby if they need it.\n* Menace (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]): A super-strong villain who is Dr. Phibes' latest minion. After trying the nanotech formula, his strength was increased, but after a while, began to lose his mind. He developed a fondness for kittens (unfortunate for Dr. Phibes, who at the time had used some stolen nanotech to turn himself into a cat) and had smiley faces on his biceps. An obvious parody of [[Bane (comics)|Bane]].\n\n==Other features of the show==\nThis is the first Scooby-Doo animated series since 1991 to make extensive use of the [[Castle thunder (sound effect)|Castle Thunder]] sound effect, which Hanna-Barbera began to stop using around 1994, and was very rarely used on ''What's New, Scooby-Doo?'' and on none of the post-2003 direct-to-video Scooby-Doo movies, to be replaced with new digitally-recorded thunderclaps.\n\nIn episode 8, there is one scene where actual footage from a few of the Scooby-Doo direct-to-video movies is used.

This unit was one of the last to carry [[Network SouthEast]] livery. It was nicknamed the \"Great Escape\" after it was exported to Germany for a while for testing. After a failed attempt to preserve it, the unit was scrapped.]]\nThe '''British Rail Class 423''' (or [[British Rail unit designations|4 VEP (Vestibuled Electro-Pneumatic brake)]]) [[electrical multiple unit]]s were built by [[British Rail]] (BR) at [[Holgate Road carriage works, York|York Works]] from 1967 to 1974, although the [[British Rail coach designations|MBSOs and TSO]]s of the first 20, 7701-7720, were constructed at [[Derby Litchurch Lane Works|Derby Works]]. They feature manually opening doors next to every seating row and were the last coaching stock built in this pattern for BR. They were mostly found working outer suburban services in [[South London]], and rural services in [[Kent]] and [[Sussex]], up to 2005 when they were finally replaced by [[Electrostar]] and [[Siemens Desiro|Desiro]] units. The fleet had a lifespan of 38 years.\n\n==Description==\n===Standard units===\nOrdered in 1965, 194 standard four-car '4 VEP' units were built between 1967 and 1974, numbered 7701-7894; subsequently becoming class 423 under TOPS. They were subsequently renumbered in the 1980s into the 30xx and 31xx series, in order to make numbers [[TOPS]] compliant. Between 1988 and 1990 the units were internally facelifted. The work involved fitting fluorescent lighting and public address equipment, and also rebuilding the MBS (motor brake second) vehicles with an additional two bays of seating in space formerly used for luggage. On refurbishment only the first 20 units were renumbered in order, in the 34xx series. All other units were renumbered from 3421 onwards, in the order they were refurbished. All units ended up swapping motor vehicles on refurbishment - the additional work on these cars made the work take longer than that carried out on trailer vehicles.\n\n===8 VAB unit===\nIn 1968, due to a shortage of suitable stock for the [[Bournemouth]] electrification scheme, BR formed an eight-carriage [[British Rail unit designations|8 VAB]] unit, no. 8001. The unit was formed of carriages from three standard sets, nos. 7739/41/42, plus a conventional locomotive-hauled buffet carriage. Three MBSOs were required within the make-up as the standard 'TRB' was not through-wired for traction power distribution. In view of this the two MBSOs in the five-car portion had collector shoes fitted to one bogie on each. The unit worked on occasions with a 4TC; this usually had a Class 33 attached to provide ETH and train lighting in the TC unit, as the 8 VAB was not fitted with ETH jumper cables on the unit ends. Its normal running formation was with another 4 VEP to make a 12-car set. The 'TRB' vehicle retained its gas-powered appliances so, unlike 4 REP buffet cars, was able to provide hot food and beverages while on diversions away from third-rail areas. Adjacent MBSO 62203 had most of its doors locked out of use and tables fitted across them for the service of meals on a 2-and-2 basis (across seats intended for five persons normally); this vehicle also had most of its luggage racks removed. The unit was later reclassified as '''Class 480''' following the introduction of [[TOPS]].\n\nThe numbering of individual vehicles are shown in the table below.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Unit No.\n!DTCoL\n!MBSO\n!TRB\n!MBSO\n!DTCoL\n!DTCoL\n!MBSO\n!DTCoL\n|-\n|align=center|8001\n|align=center|76375\n|align=center|62203\n|align=center|1759\n|align=center|62200\n|align=center|76376\n|align=center|76373\n|align=center|62202\n|align=center|76374\n|-\n|}\n\nThe unit was disbanded in 1974, following deliveries of [[British Rail Class 432|4 REP]] stock, but at least one of the original units was not reformed, as spare vehicles from the unit had replaced crash-damaged VEP vehicles in the meantime.\n\n===4 VEG units===\nIn 1978, 12 units, nos. 7788-7799, were fitted with extra luggage racks (by removing the squabs{{technical inline|date=April 2020}} and backs from certain seats) and reclassified as '''Class 427''' [[British Rail unit designations|4 VEG]] units. The units were renumbered into the range 7901-7912. These units were dedicated to the '''[[Gatwick Express]]''' services from [[London Victoria station|London Victoria]] to [[Gatwick Airport]]. Externally these units were marked by an orange/yellow (dayglo) coloured band at cantrail level with lettering 'London-Gatwick express service'. They were used on Victoria to Bognor Regis services attached at the rear from Victoria and detached at Gatwick Airport so that airline passengers did not have to rush to get off the train. The unit unit then attached to the front of an Up Bognor Regis service back to Victoria\n\nIn 1984 they were replaced on this service by [[British Rail Class 73|Class 73]] electro-diesel locomotives operating in [[push-pull train|push-pull]] with [[British Rail Class 488|Class 488]] coaching sets and [[British Rail Class 489|Class 489]] luggage vans. The twelve units were then converted back to standard sets, and regained their original unit numbers.\n\n===Vehicle numbering===\nThe numbering of individual vehicles and details of when units were built are shown in the table below.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Unit Nos.\n!Years Built\n!DTCsoL\n!MBSO\n!TSO\n!DTCsoL\n|-\n|7701-7720\n|align=center|1967\n|76231-76269 (odd)\n|62121-62140\n|70781-70800\n|76230-76268 (even)\n|-\n|7721-7755\n|align=center|1967-68\n|76333-76401 (odd)\n|62182-62216\n|70872-70906\n|76334-76402 (even)\n|-\n|7756-7805\n|align=center|1968-69\n|76441-76539 (odd)\n|62217-62266\n|70907-70956\n|76442-76540 (even)\n|-\n|7806-7815\n|align=center|1970\n|76541-76559 (odd)\n|62267-62276\n|70957-70966\n|76542-76560 (even)\n|-\n|7816-7854\n|align=center|1970-73\n|76641-76715 (odd)\n|62317-62354\n|70997-71034\n|76642-76716 (even)\n|-\n|7855-7894\n|align=center|1973-74\n|76861-76941 (odd)\n|62435-62475\n|71115-71155\n|76862-76942 (even)\n|-\n|}\n\n==Final operations==\nFollowing the [[privatisation of British Rail]] the three southern train operators all inherited large fleets of Vep units. The fleet of each franchise is described below.\n\n[[File:3445 at Waterloo East.jpg|thumb|right|Class 423/1, no. 3445 at [[Waterloo East railway station|Waterloo East]] on 8 February 2003, with a service to [[Charing Cross railway station|Charing Cross]]. This unit is painted in [[Connex South Eastern]] livery.]]\n\n===South Eastern Trains===\n[[South Eastern Trains]] operated the largest fleet of 4Vep units. The franchise was originally operated as [[Connex South Eastern]], which lost the franchise in 2003. The fleet contained several unusual units, included no. 3473, which contained a driving trailer with the compartments removed, and no. 3582, which contained former [[British Rail Class 438|4TC]] driving trailer 76275.\n\nMany units survived into 2005 because of the closure of the Folkestone\u2014Dover section of railway for tunnel refurbishment. This ended in September 2005. The final passenger service was operated on 7 October 2005, using units 3565, 3545 and 3568. Incidentally unit 3545 contained 62121, the first 4Vep MBSO built.\n\nAll the South Eastern Trains 4Vep units have now been withdrawn. One driving trailer from unit 3568, and another from 4Vep 3545, have been claimed by the [[National Railway Museum]], and the former 4TC driving trailer from unit 3582 have been preserved.\n\n[[File:3514 at London Victoria.jpg|thumb|right|Class 423/1, no. 3514 at [[London Victoria]] on 29 March 2003. This was the only unit to be painted in [[Southern (train operating company)|Southern's]] green livery and was one of the last units still in traffic with Southern.]]\n\n===South Central/Southern===\nThe [[Network SouthCentral]] division inherited a fleet of 50 standard '''Class 423/1''' units. The franchise was originally won by [[Connex South Central]], which soon applied its yellow and white livery to the fleet. However, following poor levels of service, the franchise was transferred to South Central Trains in 2000, which was later renamed as [[Southern (train operating company)|Southern]] in 2004. Only one unit, no. 3514, was ever repainted in Southern's green livery.\n\nIn 1998-1999, whilst still under the control of Connex, 19 units were modified to operate inner suburban South London \"Metro\" services. The work involved removal of internal compartments and declassification of 1st class seating. The units were reclassified as '''Class 423/9''' (or [[SR Multiple Unit Numbering and Classification#DC third rail EMUs|4 VOP]]) and renumbered in the range 3901-3919. Due to the lack of first class seating and toilets, these units were generally not used on long-distance services.\n\nIn 2003, with the general run-down of [[slam door trains]], it was decided to reform some of the 4Vop units by swapping one driving trailer with that from a standard unit. The new hybrid units were reclassified as '''Class 423/8''' (or [[SR Multiple Unit Numbering and Classification#DC third rail EMUs|4 VIP]]) and renumbered in the range 3813-3844. This was to give all units some 1st-class seating, thus making diagramming of units easier. But in the event only eight units were reformed, namely nos. 3813/14/21/22/41-44.\n\nBy 2004 Southern had started to introduce [[British Rail Class 377|Class 377]] \"Electrostar\" units into service. Although first introduced in 2002, this did not initially affect the Class 423 as the older 'Phase 1' [[British Rail Class 421|Class 421]] units were withdrawn first, due to their age and lower [[seating capacity]]. However, as more new units entered traffic, the first Class 423 units were withdrawn. Units selected for withdrawal were usually those with high mileage or in poor condition. By mid-2005 only a handful of units remained in traffic. The final diagrammed passenger service out of London was the 17:17 London Victoria to [[Eastbourne]] and [[Seaford, East Sussex|Seaford]] on 19 August 2005, formed of units 3486 and 3535, plus [[British Rail Class 421|4Cig]] 1866. Six units were subsequently retained for emergency cover. Unit 3514 was used on the Sussex Slammer railtour on Saturday 19 November 2005. \n\nThe following Saturday saw the final slam door trains on Southern, when units 3490, 3505 and 3535 formed the 09:19 Brighton to London Victoria and 11:06 London Victoria to Brighton services (via Lewes due to engineering works); this being the last scheduled mainline passenger service using southern-electric slam-door stock (the very last passenger being an off-duty HM Inspector of Railways). Following this trip the stock was withdrawn from service and initially put into Lover's Walk depot before being moved (under its own power) to Battersea Stewart's Lane Depot (road 12) from where it was hauled away at 12:26hrs on 3rd January 2006 by a class 47 locomotive for scrapping.\n\nOne complete 4 VIP unit has been preserved, and two 4 VOP units remained in departmental use until March 2013.\n\n[[File:3414 and 3419 at London Waterloo.JPG|thumb|right|Class 423/1, nos. 3414 and 3419 at [[London Waterloo railway station|London Waterloo]] on 19 July 2003. These units are painted in [[South West Trains]] livery. They have both since been withdrawn and scrapped.]]\n\n===South West Trains===\n[[South West Trains]] (SWT) inherited the second-largest number of units, with an initial fleet size of 62 units. The entire fleet was composed of standard '''Class 423/1''' units. Later, a further four units (nos. 3809-3812) were transferred from Connex South Eastern. These were also standard units, but were numbered in the 38xx series to denote they were leased from [[Porterbrook]] rather than [[HSBC Rail]].\n\nSWT quickly repainted its fleet of units into a new livery, based on the previous [[Network SouthEast]] (NSE) livery, but with the addition of an orange stripe and the absence of the grey band. All but four units (3415 and 3809-3811) were repainted. These four units were deliberately retained in NSE livery, meaning that in the final days of slam-door trains they attained \"celebrity\" status among [[railfans|rail enthusiasts]].\n\nIn 2001 SWT placed an order for 785 new carriages with [[Siemens AG]] to allow it to replace its fleet of slam-door trains, in accordance with its franchise commitment to do so by 2005. To assist Siemens in the design of [[third rail]] units, 4Vep no. 3810 was transferred to a test site in Germany to undergo tests. Following its return to Britain it became popularly known as the \"Great Escape\".\n\nSouth West Trains started to replace its slam-door fleet from early 2004, with the introduction of the first [[British Rail Class 444|Class 444]] and [[British Rail Class 450|Class 450]] [[Siemens Desiro|Desiro]] units. Around this time SWT repainted one unit, no. 3417, into its original [[Rail Blue|BR Blue]] livery to commemorate the final months in traffic of the slam-door fleet. This unit was chosen because it was one of the last to receive major works attention, and therefore had the longest life-expectancy. It was named Gordon Pettitt after a former manager of the [[Southern Region of British Railways]].\n\nIn the final months of traffic several units, including the first-built, no. 3401, were reformed in order to allow the vehicles in the best condition to be retained in service. Withdrawals of units picked up pace, with several large culls of units, the last of which occurred in March 2005. Beyond this date only a handful of units remained in traffic, namely nos. 3401/17/81 3516/20/36/76 and 3811. The final normal passenger service was operated on 26 May 2005 from [[London Waterloo railway station|London Waterloo]] to [[Bournemouth railway station|Bournemouth]], using 4 VEP 3536 sandwiched between [[British Rail Class 421|4 CIG units]] 1396 and 1398. Following withdrawal most units were rapidly towed away for scrap. The \"celebrity\" blue unit, no. 3417, has been since been sold to the [[Bluebell Railway]].\n\n[[File:Portsmouth Harbour Station 22-07-04.jpg|thumb|right|Old meets new: A Class 423 next to a Class 444 at Portsmouth Harbour.]]\n\n==Further use==\nFollowing withdrawal from normal service, several vehicles have seen further use in departmental service.\n*4 VOP units 3905 and 3918 were converted into tractor units. They were used to haul [[British Rail Class 375|Class 375]] units to and from [[Ashford railway works|Ashford]] Works.\n*MBSO 62138 (ex-unit 3567) was renumbered to 977981 and was used as a motor coach in the [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]] [[British Rail Class 960#Electric Units|V-Train no. 960201]] during [[third-rail]] testing. It has since been scrapped.\n\n==Accidents and incidents==\n*On 26 January 1985, units 7754 and 7703 formed a train with [[4 CIG]] 7395 which was halted by a landslip at [[Popham, Hampshire]] and was run into by [[British Rail Class 33|class 33]] locomotive 33 104 due to the traincrew failing to protect the rear of the stranded train. Twelve people were injured.

In addition the former [[British Rail Class 438|4TC]] driving vehicle from set 3582 has been preserved.\n\nThe more high-profile unit preserved is the former [[South West Trains]] (SWT) \"celebrity\" unit painted in BR blue livery with painted aluminium window frames, number 3417. The unit was initially used on Wimbledon depot as a [[shunter]], but with SWT needing to get it off its books it was sold to the [[Bluebell Railway]] for the nominal sum of \u00a31. It was moved to Eastleigh Works for storage, after having been used initially as the centrepiece for the Bluebell in a ceremony at [[East Grinstead railway station]] to mark the commencement of work at the station site as part of the line's work on the northern extension. The unit returned to East Grinstead for further use and storage in September 2010. In late April, the unit sustained minor damage to its shoegear as it was being driven from sidings at Clapham Junction Yard print to movement under tow to the Swanage Railway. This resulted in the traction current being discharged in the yard whilst repairs were carried out. The unit was then moved back into the sidings and then dragged to Swanage the following day. The unit was for some time stabled in the open at Clapham Junction, having previously been stored in the shed at the yard. The unit was then moved to Ilford as part of a deal brokered by the unit's support group for a full repaint. After the completion of this body work restoration, the unit was transferred to Strawberry Hill in South West London where it remains, undergoing long-term restoration by volunteers from the Southern Electric Traction Group.\n\nThe second set, 3905 was turned into a tractor unit before being used as spares by the 5 BEL Trust to restore a [[British Rail Class 403|5-Bel]] Set, It was donated for preservation and was stored at the [[Dartmoor Railway]]. In 2016 the termination of lease by [[Dartmoor Railway]] meant the unit would leave the railway and find a new home at The East Kent Railway in Sheperdswell. \n\nOne other set was briefly preserved until 2010 when it was scrapped, 3822, was located at the Churnet Valley Railway and was partially restored. In 2008 half of the set was returned to as-built BR Blue and received internal repairs. The other half remained in \"as withdrawn\" Connex condition, and the set operated at several special events throughout that year.\n\nThere was an attempt to preserve unit 3810 (the unit that was briefly exported to Germany), but this failed and the unit was scrapped.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=4|Unit number <br><small>(current in bold)</small>\n!valign=\"top\"|Type\n!valign=\"top\"|DTCsoL \n!valign=\"top\"|MBSO\n!valign=\"top\"|TSO\n!valign=\"top\"|DTCsoL\n!valign=\"top\" align=left|Livery\n!valign=\"top\" align=left|Location\n!valign=\"top\" align=left|Notes\n|- bgcolor=fedcba\n|align=center|7717\n|align=center|3017\n|align=center|'''3417'''\n|align=center|-\n|align=center|4 VEP\n|align=center|76262\n|align=center|62236\n|align=center|70797\n|align=center|76263\n|BR Blue\n|[[Bluebell Railway]]\n|align=left|<small>Owned by the [[Bluebell Railway]].

This unit was one of the last to carry [[Network SouthEast]] livery. It was nicknamed the \"Great Escape\" after it was exported to Germany for a while for testing. After a failed attempt to preserve it, the unit was scrapped.]]\nThe '''British Rail Class 423''' (or [[British Rail unit designations|4 VEP (Vestibuled Electro-Pneumatic brake)]]) [[electrical multiple unit]]s were built by [[British Rail]] (BR) at [[Holgate Road carriage works, York|York Works]] from 1967 to 1974, although the [[British Rail coach designations|MBSOs and TSO]]s of the first 20, 7701-7720, were constructed at [[Derby Litchurch Lane Works|Derby Works]]. They feature manually opening doors next to every seating row and were the last coaching stock built in this pattern for BR. They were mostly found working outer suburban services in [[South London]], and rural services in [[Kent]] and [[Sussex]], up to 2005 when they were finally replaced by [[Electrostar]] and [[Siemens Desiro|Desiro]] units. The fleet had a lifespan of 38 years.\n\n==Description==\n===Standard units===\nOrdered in 1965, 194 standard four-car '4 VEP' units were built between 1967 and 1974, numbered 7701-7894; subsequently becoming class 423 under TOPS. They were subsequently renumbered in the 1980s into the 30xx and 31xx series, in order to make numbers [[TOPS]] compliant. Between 1988 and 1990 the units were internally facelifted. The work involved fitting fluorescent lighting and public address equipment, and also rebuilding the MBS (motor brake second) vehicles with an additional two bays of seating in space formerly used for luggage. On refurbishment only the first 20 units were renumbered in order, in the 34xx series. All other units were renumbered from 3421 onwards, in the order they were refurbished. All units ended up swapping motor vehicles on refurbishment - the additional work on these cars made the work take longer than that carried out on trailer vehicles.\n\n===8 VAB unit===\nIn 1968, due to a shortage of suitable stock for the [[Bournemouth]] electrification scheme, BR formed an eight-carriage [[British Rail unit designations|8 VAB]] unit, no. 8001. The unit was formed of carriages from three standard sets, nos. 7739/41/42, plus a conventional locomotive-hauled buffet carriage. Three MBSOs were required within the make-up as the standard 'TRB' was not through-wired for traction power distribution. In view of this the two MBSOs in the five-car portion had collector shoes fitted to one bogie on each. The unit worked on occasions with a 4TC; this usually had a Class 33 attached to provide ETH and train lighting in the TC unit, as the 8 VAB was not fitted with ETH jumper cables on the unit ends. Its normal running formation was with another 4 VEP to make a 12-car set. The 'TRB' vehicle retained its gas-powered appliances so, unlike 4 REP buffet cars, was able to provide hot food and beverages while on diversions away from third-rail areas. Adjacent MBSO 62203 had most of its doors locked out of use and tables fitted across them for the service of meals on a 2-and-2 basis (across seats intended for five persons normally); this vehicle also had most of its luggage racks removed. The unit was later reclassified as '''Class 480''' following the introduction of [[TOPS]].\n\nThe numbering of individual vehicles are shown in the table below.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Unit No.\n!DTCoL\n!MBSO\n!TRB\n!MBSO\n!DTCoL\n!DTCoL\n!MBSO\n!DTCoL\n|-\n|align=center|8001\n|align=center|76375\n|align=center|62203\n|align=center|1759\n|align=center|62200\n|align=center|76376\n|align=center|76373\n|align=center|62202\n|align=center|76374\n|-\n|}\n\nThe unit was disbanded in 1974, following deliveries of [[British Rail Class 432|4 REP]] stock, but at least one of the original units was not reformed, as spare vehicles from the unit had replaced crash-damaged VEP vehicles in the meantime.\n\n===4 VEG units===\nIn 1978, 12 units, nos. 7788-7799, were fitted with extra luggage racks (by removing the squabs and backs from certain seats) and reclassified as '''Class 427''' [[British Rail unit designations|4 VEG]] units. The units were renumbered into the range 7901-7912. These units were dedicated to the '''[[Gatwick Express]]''' services from [[London Victoria station|London Victoria]] to [[Gatwick Airport]]. Externally these units were marked by an orange/yellow (dayglo) coloured band at cantrail level with lettering 'London-Gatwick express service'. They were used on Victoria to Bognor Regis services attached at the rear from Victoria and detached at Gatwick Airport so that airline passengers did not have to rush to get off the train. The unit unit then attached to the front of an Up Bognor Regis service back to Victoria\n\nIn 1984 they were replaced on this service by [[British Rail Class 73|Class 73]] electro-diesel locomotives operating in [[push-pull train|push-pull]] with [[British Rail Class 488|Class 488]] coaching sets and [[British Rail Class 489|Class 489]] luggage vans. The twelve units were then converted back to standard sets, and regained their original unit numbers.\n\n===Vehicle numbering===\nThe numbering of individual vehicles and details of when units were built are shown in the table below.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Unit Nos.\n!Years Built\n!DTCsoL\n!MBSO\n!TSO\n!DTCsoL\n|-\n|7701-7720\n|align=center|1967\n|76231-76269 (odd)\n|62121-62140\n|70781-70800\n|76230-76268 (even)\n|-\n|7721-7755\n|align=center|1967-68\n|76333-76401 (odd)\n|62182-62216\n|70872-70906\n|76334-76402 (even)\n|-\n|7756-7805\n|align=center|1968-69\n|76441-76539 (odd)\n|62217-62266\n|70907-70956\n|76442-76540 (even)\n|-\n|7806-7815\n|align=center|1970\n|76541-76559 (odd)\n|62267-62276\n|70957-70966\n|76542-76560 (even)\n|-\n|7816-7854\n|align=center|1970-73\n|76641-76715 (odd)\n|62317-62354\n|70997-71034\n|76642-76716 (even)\n|-\n|7855-7894\n|align=center|1973-74\n|76861-76941 (odd)\n|62435-62475\n|71115-71155\n|76862-76942 (even)\n|-\n|}\n\n==Final operations==\nFollowing the [[privatisation of British Rail]] the three southern train operators all inherited large fleets of Vep units. The fleet of each franchise is described below.\n\n[[File:3445 at Waterloo East.jpg|thumb|right|Class 423/1, no. 3445 at [[Waterloo East railway station|Waterloo East]] on 8 February 2003, with a service to [[Charing Cross railway station|Charing Cross]]. This unit is painted in [[Connex South Eastern]] livery.]]\n\n===South Eastern Trains===\n[[South Eastern Trains]] operated the largest fleet of 4Vep units. The franchise was originally operated as [[Connex South Eastern]], which lost the franchise in 2003. The fleet contained several unusual units, included no. 3473, which contained a driving trailer with the compartments removed, and no. 3582, which contained former [[British Rail Class 438|4TC]] driving trailer 76275.\n\nMany units survived into 2005 because of the closure of the Folkestone\u2014Dover section of railway for tunnel refurbishment. This ended in September 2005. The final passenger service was operated on 7 October 2005, using units 3565, 3545 and 3568. Incidentally unit 3545 contained 62121, the first 4Vep MBSO built.\n\nAll the South Eastern Trains 4Vep units have now been withdrawn. One driving trailer from unit 3568, and another from 4Vep 3545, have been claimed by the [[National Railway Museum]], and the former 4TC driving trailer from unit 3582 have been preserved.\n\n[[File:3514 at London Victoria.jpg|thumb|right|Class 423/1, no. 3514 at [[London Victoria]] on 29 March 2003. This was the only unit to be painted in [[Southern (train operating company)|Southern's]] green livery and was one of the last units still in traffic with Southern.]]\n\n===South Central/Southern===\nThe [[Network SouthCentral]] division inherited a fleet of 50 standard '''Class 423/1''' units. The franchise was originally won by [[Connex South Central]], which soon applied its yellow and white livery to the fleet. However, following poor levels of service, the franchise was transferred to South Central Trains in 2000, which was later renamed as [[Southern (train operating company)|Southern]] in 2004. Only one unit, no. 3514, was ever repainted in Southern's green livery.\n\nIn 1998-1999, whilst still under the control of Connex, 19 units were modified to operate inner suburban South London \"Metro\" services. The work involved removal of internal compartments and declassification of 1st class seating. The units were reclassified as '''Class 423/9''' (or [[SR Multiple Unit Numbering and Classification#DC third rail EMUs|4 VOP]]) and renumbered in the range 3901-3919. Due to the lack of first class seating and toilets, these units were generally not used on long-distance services.\n\nIn 2003, with the general run-down of [[slam door trains]], it was decided to reform some of the 4Vop units by swapping one driving trailer with that from a standard unit. The new hybrid units were reclassified as '''Class 423/8''' (or [[SR Multiple Unit Numbering and Classification#DC third rail EMUs|4 VIP]]) and renumbered in the range 3813-3844. This was to give all units some 1st-class seating, thus making diagramming of units easier. But in the event only eight units were reformed, namely nos. 3813/14/21/22/41-44.\n\nBy 2004 Southern had started to introduce [[British Rail Class 377|Class 377]] \"Electrostar\" units into service. Although first introduced in 2002, this did not initially affect the Class 423 as the older 'Phase 1' [[British Rail Class 421|Class 421]] units were withdrawn first, due to their age and lower [[seating capacity]]. However, as more new units entered traffic, the first Class 423 units were withdrawn. Units selected for withdrawal were usually those with high mileage or in poor condition. By mid-2005 only a handful of units remained in traffic. The final diagrammed passenger service out of London was the 17:17 London Victoria to [[Eastbourne]] and [[Seaford, East Sussex|Seaford]] on 19 August 2005, formed of units 3486 and 3535, plus [[British Rail Class 421|4Cig]] 1866. Six units were subsequently retained for emergency cover. Unit 3514 was used on the Sussex Slammer railtour on Saturday 19 November 2005. \n\nThe following Saturday saw the final slam door trains on Southern, when units 3490, 3505 and 3535 formed the 09:19 Brighton to London Victoria and 11:06 London Victoria to Brighton services (via Lewes due to engineering works); this being the last scheduled mainline passenger service using southern-electric slam-door stock (the very last passenger being an off-duty HM Inspector of Railways). Following this trip the stock was withdrawn from service and initially put into Lover's Walk depot before being moved (under its own power) to Battersea Stewart's Lane Depot (road 12) from where it was hauled away at 12:26hrs on 3rd January 2006 by a class 47 locomotive for scrapping.\n\nOne complete 4 VIP unit has been preserved, and two 4 VOP units remained in departmental use until March 2013.\n\n[[File:3414 and 3419 at London Waterloo.JPG|thumb|right|Class 423/1, nos. 3414 and 3419 at [[London Waterloo railway station|London Waterloo]] on 19 July 2003. These units are painted in [[South West Trains]] livery. They have both since been withdrawn and scrapped.]]\n\n===South West Trains===\n[[South West Trains]] (SWT) inherited the second-largest number of units, with an initial fleet size of 62 units. The entire fleet was composed of standard '''Class 423/1''' units. Later, a further four units (nos. 3809-3812) were transferred from Connex South Eastern. These were also standard units, but were numbered in the 38xx series to denote they were leased from [[Porterbrook]] rather than [[HSBC Rail]].\n\nSWT quickly repainted its fleet of units into a new livery, based on the previous [[Network SouthEast]] (NSE) livery, but with the addition of an orange stripe and the absence of the grey band. All but four units (3415 and 3809-3811) were repainted. These four units were deliberately retained in NSE livery, meaning that in the final days of slam-door trains they attained \"celebrity\" status among [[railfans|rail enthusiasts]].\n\nIn 2001 SWT placed an order for 785 new carriages with [[Siemens AG]] to allow it to replace its fleet of slam-door trains, in accordance with its franchise commitment to do so by 2005. To assist Siemens in the design of [[third rail]] units, 4Vep no. 3810 was transferred to a test site in Germany to undergo tests. Following its return to Britain it became popularly known as the \"Great Escape\".\n\nSouth West Trains started to replace its slam-door fleet from early 2004, with the introduction of the first [[British Rail Class 444|Class 444]] and [[British Rail Class 450|Class 450]] [[Siemens Desiro|Desiro]] units. Around this time SWT repainted one unit, no. 3417, into its original [[Rail Blue|BR Blue]] livery to commemorate the final months in traffic of the slam-door fleet. This unit was chosen because it was one of the last to receive major works attention, and therefore had the longest life-expectancy. It was named Gordon Pettitt after a former manager of the [[Southern Region of British Railways]].\n\nIn the final months of traffic several units, including the first-built, no. 3401, were reformed in order to allow the vehicles in the best condition to be retained in service. Withdrawals of units picked up pace, with several large culls of units, the last of which occurred in March 2005. Beyond this date only a handful of units remained in traffic, namely nos. 3401/17/81 3516/20/36/76 and 3811. The final normal passenger service was operated on 26 May 2005 from [[London Waterloo railway station|London Waterloo]] to [[Bournemouth railway station|Bournemouth]], using 4 VEP 3536 sandwiched between [[British Rail Class 421|4 CIG units]] 1396 and 1398. Following withdrawal most units were rapidly towed away for scrap. The \"celebrity\" blue unit, no. 3417, has been since been sold to the [[Bluebell Railway]].\n\n[[File:Portsmouth Harbour Station 22-07-04.jpg|thumb|right|Old meets new: A Class 423 next to a Class 444 at Portsmouth Harbour.]]\n\n==Further use==\nFollowing withdrawal from normal service, several vehicles have seen further use in departmental service.\n*4 VOP units 3905 and 3918 were converted into tractor units. They were used to haul [[British Rail Class 375|Class 375]] units to and from [[Ashford railway works|Ashford]] Works.\n*MBSO 62138 (ex-unit 3567) was renumbered to 977981 and was used as a motor coach in the [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]] [[British Rail Class 960#Electric Units|V-Train no. 960201]] during [[third-rail]] testing. It has since been scrapped.\n\n==Accidents and incidents==\n*On 26 January 1985, units 7754 and 7703 formed a train with [[4 CIG]] 7395 which was halted by a landslip at [[Popham, Hampshire]] and was run into by [[British Rail Class 33|class 33]] locomotive 33 104 due to the traincrew failing to protect the rear of the stranded train. Twelve people were injured.

In addition the former [[British Rail Class 438|4TC]] driving vehicle from set 3582 has been preserved.\n\nThe more high-profile unit preserved is the former [[South West Trains]] (SWT) \"celebrity\" unit painted in BR blue livery with painted aluminium window frames, number 3417. The unit was initially used on Wimbledon depot as a [[shunter]], but with SWT needing to get it off its books it was sold to the [[Bluebell Railway]] for the nominal sum of \u00a31. It was moved to Eastleigh Works for storage, after having been used initially as the centrepiece for the Bluebell in a ceremony at [[East Grinstead railway station]] to mark the commencement of work at the station site as part of the line's work on the northern extension. The unit returned to East Grinstead for further use and storage in September 2010. In late April, the unit sustained minor damage to its shoegear as it was being driven from sidings at Clapham Junction Yard print to movement under tow to the Swanage Railway. This resulted in the traction current being discharged in the yard whilst repairs were carried out. The unit was then moved back into the sidings and then dragged to Swanage the following day. The unit was for some time stabled in the open at Clapham Junction, having previously been stored in the shed at the yard. The unit was then moved to Ilford as part of a deal brokered by the unit's support group for a full repaint. After the completion of this body work restoration, the unit was transferred to Strawberry Hill in South West London where it remains, undergoing long-term restoration by volunteers from the Southern Electric Traction Group.\n\nThe second set, 3905 was turned into a tractor unit before being used as spares by the 5 BEL Trust to restore a [[British Rail Class 403|5-Bel]] Set, It was donated for preservation and was stored at the [[Dartmoor Railway]]. In 2016 the termination of lease by [[Dartmoor Railway]] meant the unit would leave the railway and find a new home at The East Kent Railway in Sheperdswell. \n\nOne other set was briefly preserved until 2010 when it was scrapped, 3822, was located at the Churnet Valley Railway and was partially restored. In 2008 half of the set was returned to as-built BR Blue and received internal repairs. The other half remained in \"as withdrawn\" Connex condition, and the set operated at several special events throughout that year.\n\nThere was an attempt to preserve unit 3810 (the unit that was briefly exported to Germany), but this failed and the unit was scrapped.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=4|Unit number <br><small>(current in bold)</small>\n!valign=\"top\"|Type\n!valign=\"top\"|DTCsoL \n!valign=\"top\"|MBSO\n!valign=\"top\"|TSO\n!valign=\"top\"|DTCsoL\n!valign=\"top\" align=left|Livery\n!valign=\"top\" align=left|Location\n!valign=\"top\" align=left|Notes\n|- bgcolor=fedcba\n|align=center|7717\n|align=center|3017\n|align=center|'''3417'''\n|align=center|-\n|align=center|4 VEP\n|align=center|76262\n|align=center|62236\n|align=center|70797\n|align=center|76263\n|BR Blue\n|[[Bluebell Railway]]\n|align=left|<small>Owned by the [[Bluebell Railway]].
