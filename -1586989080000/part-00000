Upon leaving Blood Island, the ship carrying Dr. Bill Foster (John Ashley), Sheila Willard, her father and Carlos Lopez explodes and sinks after mutated \"chlorophyll creature\" Don Ramon Lopez (the titular \"Beast\") is found secreted on board and goes on a rampage, destroying the ship. The monstrous Don Ramon washes up back on Blood Island and heads into the jungle. Dr. Foster is the only other survivor, and after a few months recovering in a hospital, he heads back to Blood Island on another ship. On board is reporter Myra Russell ([[Celeste Yarnall]]), who is investigating the explosion of the ship.\n\nWhen Foster and Russell arrive on the island, they find the natives in a state of fear, believing that the old Lopez mansion is cursed. With the village headman Ramu ([[Alfonso Carvajal (actor)|Alfonso Carvajal]]) and the ship's captain (played by co-producer Beverly Miller), they search the house and find Razak (Bruno Punzalan) alive. The \"green men\" return and after a fight, Myra is captured and taken to the evil Dr. Lorca ([[Eddie Garcia]]), who is still alive, but horribly scarred from his seeming demise in the earlier film.\n\nDr. Foster and Laida (Liza Belmonte) search the mountains and find Dr. Lorca's hidden lab. Laida goes back to the village for help and Lorca shows Foster his latest experiments. He has removed Don Ramon's head and has attached it to machines, while the decapitated body remains strapped to a table. Lorca knows the head can speak, but it refuses to say anything.\n\nThe captain, Laida and Ramu lead an attack on Lorca's headquarters and fight with his men. Laida finds her father, who shows signs of the chlorophyll poisoning, and rescues him. Foster shoots Razak. Don Ramon's head controls his body from afar and wills it to attack and apparently kill Dr. Lorca, crushing his head with a piece of machinery. Lorca's lab explodes, killing all inside, and Foster and the group leave with a box of Dr. Lorca's papers and notes.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[John Ashley (actor)|John Ashley]] as Dr. Bill Foster \n*[[Celeste Yarnall]] as Myra J.

It runs from [[Interstate 280 (California)|I-280]] and [[California State Route 17|State Route 17]] (SR&nbsp;17) in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] to [[Interstate 80 in California|I-80]] and [[Interstate 580 (California)|I-580]] in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], running parallel to the eastern shore of [[San Francisco Bay]]. For most of its route, I-880 is officially known as the '''Nimitz Freeway''', after [[World War II]] fleet admiral [[Chester Nimitz]], who retired to the Bay Area and lived on [[Yerba Buena Island]]. The northernmost five miles is also commonly referred to as the '''Cypress Freeway''', after the former alignment of the freeway, and its subsequent replacement.\n\n==Route description==\n[[File:I-880 Hayward May 2011 001.jpg|thumb|left|I-880 approaching CA-92 in Hayward]]\n\nThe southern terminus of I-880 is at its interchange with [[Interstate 280 (California)|I-280]] and [[California State Route 17|SR 17]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]. From there, it heads roughly northeast past the [[San Jose International Airport]] to [[U.S. Route 101 in California|U.S. Route 101]] (US&nbsp;101). The Nimitz Freeway then turns northwest, running parallel to the southeastern shore of [[San Francisco Bay]], connecting the cities of [[Milpitas, California|Milpitas]], [[Fremont, California|Fremont]], [[Newark, California|Newark]], [[Union City, California|Union City]], [[Hayward, California|Hayward]], and [[San Leandro, California|San Leandro]] before reaching [[Oakland, California|Oakland]]. In [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], I-880 passes by [[Oakland International Airport]], [[Oakland\u2013Alameda County Coliseum]] and [[Downtown Oakland]]. The northern terminus of I-880 is in Oakland at the junction with [[Interstate 80 in California|I-80]] and [[Interstate 580 (California)|I-580]] (known as the [[MacArthur Maze]]), near the eastern approach of the [[San Francisco\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge|Bay Bridge]].\n\nI-880 between [[Interstate 238|I-238]] in San Leandro and the MacArthur Maze is used as an alternate truck route; trucks over {{convert|4.5|ST|t}} are prohibited through Oakland on I-580.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/traffops/trucks/routes/restrict-hist-580.htm |title = California Interstate Route 580 Special Restriction History |publisher = California Department of Transportation |accessdate = July 16, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nI-880 is part of the [[California Freeway and Expressway System]],<ref name=\"cafes\">{{CAFESystem}}</ref> and is part of the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]],<ref name=fhwa-nhs>{{FHWA NHS map|region=sanfrancisco|accessdate=July 23, 2017}}</ref> a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the [[Federal Highway Administration]].<ref name=NHS-FHWA>{{FHWA NHS}}</ref> Officially, the Nimitz Freeway designation is Route 880 from Route 101 to Route 80, as named by Senate Concurrent Resolution 23, Chapter 84 in 1958.<ref>{{CA Named Freeways | pages=85}}</ref>\n\nSince the late 1990s, an infamous misconception for certain commuters and businesses in San Jose is that I-880 extends from I-280 to [[California State Route 85|SR 85]] in [[Los Gatos, California|Los Gatos]] (which would extend the length to {{convert|50|mi|km|1|disp=sqbr}}).\n\n==History==\n[[File:Interstate 880 and BART cable car.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Oakland Airport Connector]] traverses I-880 in Oakland, with [[Oakland\u2013Alameda County Coliseum]] and [[Oracle Arena]] right of center]]\nThe state legislature added the proposed [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]-[[Richmond, California|Richmond]] [[East Shore Highway]] to the state highway system in 1933, and it became an extension of the previously short ([[San Rafael, California|San Rafael]] to the bay) [[Legislative Route 69 (California pre-1964)|Legislative Route 69]],<ref>{{cite CAstat|year=1933|ch=767|p=2036}}: \"San Jose to Richmond (East Shore Highway).\"</ref><ref>{{cite CAstat|year=1935|ch=29|p=280}}: \"Route 69 is from: (a) Route 1 near San Rafael to Point San Quentin.

For most of its route, I-880 is officially known as the '''Nimitz Freeway''', after [[World War II]] fleet admiral [[Chester Nimitz]], who retired to the Bay Area and lived on [[Yerba Buena Island]]. The northernmost five miles is also commonly referred to as the '''Cypress Freeway''', after the former alignment of the freeway, and its subsequent replacement.\n\n==Route description==\n[[File:I-880 Hayward May 2011 001.jpg|thumb|left|I-880 approaching CA-92 in Hayward]]\n\nThe southern terminus of I-880 is at its interchange with [[Interstate 280 (California)|I-280]] and [[California State Route 17|SR 17]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]. From there, it heads roughly northeast past the [[San Jose International Airport]] to [[U.S. Route 101 in California|U.S. Route 101]] (US&nbsp;101). The Nimitz Freeway then turns northwest, running parallel to the southeastern shore of [[San Francisco Bay]], connecting the cities of [[Milpitas, California|Milpitas]], [[Fremont, California|Fremont]], [[Newark, California|Newark]], [[Union City, California|Union City]], [[Hayward, California|Hayward]], and [[San Leandro, California|San Leandro]] before reaching [[Oakland, California|Oakland]]. In [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], I-880 passes by [[Oakland International Airport]], [[Oakland\u2013Alameda County Coliseum]] and [[Downtown Oakland]]. The northern terminus of I-880 is in Oakland at the junction with [[Interstate 80 in California|I-80]] and [[Interstate 580 (California)|I-580]] (known as the [[MacArthur Maze]]), near the eastern approach of the [[San Francisco\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge|Bay Bridge]].\n\nI-880 between [[Interstate 238|I-238]] in San Leandro and the MacArthur Maze is used as an alternate truck route; trucks over {{convert|4.5|ST|t}} are prohibited through Oakland on I-580.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/traffops/trucks/routes/restrict-hist-580.htm |title = California Interstate Route 580 Special Restriction History |publisher = California Department of Transportation |accessdate = July 16, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nI-880 is part of the [[California Freeway and Expressway System]],<ref name=\"cafes\">{{CAFESystem}}</ref> and is part of the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]],<ref name=fhwa-nhs>{{FHWA NHS map|region=sanfrancisco|accessdate=July 23, 2017}}</ref> a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the [[Federal Highway Administration]].<ref name=NHS-FHWA>{{FHWA NHS}}</ref> Officially, the Nimitz Freeway designation is Route 880 from Route 101 to Route 80, as named by Senate Concurrent Resolution 23, Chapter 84 in 1958.<ref>{{CA Named Freeways | pages=85}}</ref>\n\nSince the late 1990s, an infamous misconception for certain commuters and businesses in San Jose is that I-880 extends from I-280 to [[California State Route 85|SR 85]] in [[Los Gatos, California|Los Gatos]] (which would extend the length to {{convert|50|mi|km|1|disp=sqbr}}).\n\n==History==\n[[File:Interstate 880 and BART cable car.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Oakland Airport Connector]] traverses I-880 in Oakland, with [[Oakland\u2013Alameda County Coliseum]] and [[Oracle Arena]] right of center]]\nThe state legislature added the proposed [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]-[[Richmond, California|Richmond]] [[East Shore Highway]] to the state highway system in 1933, and it became an extension of the previously short ([[San Rafael, California|San Rafael]] to the bay) [[Legislative Route 69 (California pre-1964)|Legislative Route 69]],<ref>{{cite CAstat|year=1933|ch=767|p=2036}}: \"San Jose to Richmond (East Shore Highway).\"</ref><ref>{{cite CAstat|year=1935|ch=29|p=280}}: \"Route 69 is from: (a) Route 1 near San Rafael to Point San Quentin.

The track was built in [[2001 in sports|2001]] and is currently closed to all competitive events, but has been used for driving schools and [[GT Academy]].\n\nIt is a [[concrete]] oval track 1{{fraction|1|3}}&nbsp;miles (2.145&nbsp;km) long. Nashville Superspeedway is owned [[Dover Motorsports Incorporated]], which also owns [[Dover International Speedway]]. Nashville Superspeedway was the longest concrete oval in NASCAR during the time it was on the NASCAR [[Xfinity Series]] and NASCAR [[Camping World Truck Series]] circuits. Current permanent [[seating capacity]] is approximately 50,000.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20040622143927/http://www.nashvillesuperspeedway.com/aboutUs.html Welcome to Nashville Superspeedway<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Additional portable seats are brought in for some events, and seating capacity can be expanded to 150,000.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050413012726/http://www.nashvillesuperspeedway.com/aboutUs.html Welcome to Nashville Superspeedway<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Infrastructure is in place to expand the facility to include a short track, drag strip, and road course.\n\n==History==\nAt its peak, the facility hosted four major races each year: two NASCAR Xfinity Series races and two NASCAR Camping World Truck Series races (one per year prior to 2010). The [[IndyCar Series]] [[Firestone Indy 200]] was run at the track from its opening until 2008. Each feature event was usually accompanied by a companion event from lower-tier series such as [[Automobile Racing Club of America|ARCA]] and [[Firestone Indy Lights|Indy Lights]]. NASCAR continually showed little interest in staging a [[Sprint Cup Series]] race at the track.\n\nIn October 2009, Dover Motorsports decided to close [[Memphis Motorsports Park]], and the Memphis Truck race originally scheduled for late June 2010 was moved to Nashville Superspeedway on April 2, one day prior to the annual Nationwide Series race at the track.  The April Truck race was known as the \"Nashville 200\". Nashville Superspeedway became the only facility on the circuit to host two Truck Series races without hosting a NASCAR Cup event.\n\nAs is a Nashville metropolitan tradition, specially-designed [[Gibson Les Paul]] guitars are presented to race winners in place of conventional trophies.<ref name=\"Unique Trophies\">{{cite web |url=https://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/gallery/2014/07/10/unique-trophies-in-nascar.html#miles3 |title=Unique trophies in NASCAR |publisher=[[NASCAR]] |date=September 25, 2014 |accessdate=April 26, 2018}}</ref> The track also has a reputation for producing many first-time winners.\n\nThe track is referred by the classic term of a \"superspeedway\" (a track of one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) or longer, compared to a short track), and is named to differentiate itself from the .596&nbsp;mile [[Fairgrounds Speedway]] (previously known as Nashville Speedway USA) at the Tennessee State Fairgrounds near downtown Nashville. Until 1984, Nashville Speedway USA had conducted a pair of 420-lap Cup races, but NASCAR pulled its sanctioning license from the circuit after disputes over who would manage the track took place prior to the start of the 1985 season.\n\n===Records===\n* NASCAR Xfinity Series Qualifying: [[David Stremme]], 28.811 sec.

The track was built in [[2001 in sports|2001]] and is currently closed to all competitive events, but has been used for driving schools and [[GT Academy]].\n\nIt is a [[concrete]] oval track 1{{fraction|1|3}}&nbsp;miles (2.145&nbsp;km) long. Nashville Superspeedway is owned [[Dover Motorsports Incorporated]], which also owns [[Dover International Speedway]]. Nashville Superspeedway was the longest concrete oval in NASCAR during the time it was on the NASCAR [[Xfinity Series]] and NASCAR [[Camping World Truck Series]] circuits. Current permanent [[seating capacity]] is approximately 50,000.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20040622143927/http://www.nashvillesuperspeedway.com/aboutUs.html Welcome to Nashville Superspeedway<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Additional portable seats are brought in for some events, and seating capacity can be expanded to 150,000.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050413012726/http://www.nashvillesuperspeedway.com/aboutUs.html Welcome to Nashville Superspeedway<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Infrastructure is in place to expand the facility to include a short track, drag strip, and road course.\n\n==History==\nAt its peak, the facility hosted four major races each year: two NASCAR Xfinity Series races and two NASCAR Camping World Truck Series races (one per year prior to 2010). The [[IndyCar Series]] [[Firestone Indy 200]] was run at the track from its opening until 2008. Each feature event was usually accompanied by a companion event from lower-tier series such as [[Automobile Racing Club of America|ARCA]] and [[Firestone Indy Lights|Indy Lights]]. NASCAR continually showed little interest in staging a [[Sprint Cup Series]] race at the track.\n\nIn October 2009, Dover Motorsports decided to close [[Memphis Motorsports Park]], and the Memphis Truck race originally scheduled for late June 2010 was moved to Nashville Superspeedway on April 2, one day prior to the annual Nationwide Series race at the track.  The April Truck race was known as the \"Nashville 200\". Nashville Superspeedway became the only facility on the circuit to host two Truck Series races without hosting a NASCAR Cup event.\n\nAs is a Nashville metropolitan tradition, specially-designed [[Gibson Les Paul]] guitars are presented to race winners in place of conventional trophies.<ref name=\"Unique Trophies\">{{cite web |url=https://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/gallery/2014/07/10/unique-trophies-in-nascar.html#miles3 |title=Unique trophies in NASCAR |publisher=[[NASCAR]] |date=September 25, 2014 |accessdate=April 26, 2018}}</ref> The track also has a reputation for producing many first-time winners.\n\nThe track is referred by the classic term of a \"superspeedway\" (a track of one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) or longer, compared to a short track), and is named to differentiate itself from the .596&nbsp;mile [[Fairgrounds Speedway]] (previously known as Nashville Speedway USA) at the Tennessee State Fairgrounds near downtown Nashville. Until 1984, Nashville Speedway USA had conducted a pair of 420-lap Cup races, but NASCAR pulled its sanctioning license from the circuit after disputes over who would manage the track took place prior to the start of the 1985 season.\n\n===Records===\n* NASCAR Xfinity Series Qualifying: [[David Stremme]], 28.811 sec.

{"title_page": "History of the Outer Hebrides", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{History of Scotland}}\n\nThe [[Hebrides]] were settled early on in the [[Prehistoric Scotland|settlement of the British Isles]], perhaps as early as the [[Mesolithic|Mesolithic era]], around 8500\u20138250 BC, after the climatic conditions improved enough to sustain human settlement.  There are examples of structures possibly dating from up to 3000 BC, the finest example being the standing stones at [[Callanish]], but some archaeologists date the site as [[Bronze Age]]. Little is known of the people who settled in the Hebrides but they were likely of the same [[Celts|Celtic]] stock that had settled in the rest of [[Scotland]]. Settlements at [[Northton]], [[Harris, Outer Hebrides|Harris]], have both [[Beaker culture|Beaker]] & [[Neolithic]] dwelling houses, the oldest in the [[Western Isles]], attesting to the settlement.\n\n==Celtic Era==\nThe earliest written mention of the Outer Hebrides was by the Greek historian Diodorus Siculus in 55 BC.  He wrote that there was an island called Hyperborea (which means \"Far to the North\") where a round temple stood from which the moon appeared only a little distance above the earth every 19 years, an apparent reference to the stone circle at Callanish.  Pomponius Mela, a Roman-Spanish writer of the first century, refers to a group of seven islands to which he gave the name Haemodae (Hebrides???).  Other ancient writers such as [[Pliny the Elder]], the Egyptian astronomer [[Ptolemy]], and Solinus (3 AD) all seem to mention the Hebrides, attesting to some contact of the peoples there with the Roman world.\n\nLittle is known of the history of the peoples of the Hebrides before the 6th century as they, like the rest of Scotland, were in the depths of what centuries later became known as the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]. The first written records of the islands come with the arrival of [[St. Columba]] in the 6th century. It was this Irish-Scottish saint who first brought Christianity to the islands, founding several churches.\n\n==Kingdom of the Isles==\n{{main|Kingdom of the Isles}}\nThe Kingdom of the Isles (also known as the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles) was a [[Norsemen|Norse]] [[monarchy|kingdom]] that existed in the [[British Isles]] from 1079 until 1266.\n\nThe kingdom was formed by [[Godred Crovan]] when he seized the Isle of Man from other Vikings, probably from Dublin in 1079. In the first two attempts at capturing the island Godred was defeated; it was only with his third try that he was victorious near [[Ramsey, Isle of Man|Ramsey]]. Previously, the islands had been taken between c.700\u2013900 AD, during the Viking invasions of the British Isles. Up until the arrival of Godred the islands had been administered by the Norse Kingdoms of [[Dublin]] and [[Orkney]]. The later Kingdom of Mann was centred around the Isle of Man but also contained the Outer Hebrides, the Inner Hebrides forming the Kingdom of the Hebrides.\n\n==The Hebrides under Norse control==\nKnown as ''Su\u00f0reyar'' or southern islands in [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]]. [[Norsemen|Norse]] control of the Hebrides was formalised in 1098 when [[Edgar of Scotland]] recognised the claim of [[Magnus III of Norway]].  The Scottish acceptance of Magnus III as King of the Isles came after the Norwegian king had conquered the [[Orkney Islands]], the Hebrides and the [[Isle of Man]] in a swift campaign earlier the same year, directed against the local Norwegian leaders of the various islands.  By capturing the islands Magnus III subdued the [[Norsemen]] who had seized the islands centuries earlier and imposed a more direct royal control.\n\nThe Norwegian control of both the Inner and Outer Hebrides would see almost constant warfare until being ultimately resolved by the partitioning of the Western Isles in 1156. The Outer Hebrides would remain under the [[Kingdom of Mann and the Isles]] while the Inner Hebrides broke out under [[Somerled]], the Norse-Celtic kinsman of both [[Lulach]] and the Manx royal house. Although the Inner Hebrides, from 1156 known as the Kingdom of the Hebrides, was still nominally under the sovereignty of Norway, the leaders were Scottish in language and Gaelic in culture rather than Norse.\n\nTwo years after his victory of 1156 Somerled went on to seize control over the Isle of Man itself and become the last King of the Isle of Man and the Isles to rule over all the islands that the kingdom had once included. After Somerled's death in 1164 the rulers of Mann would no longer be in control of the Inner Hebrides.\n\n==Scottish Control==\n[[File:HakonTheOldAndSkule-Flateyjarbok.jpg|thumb|right|An illustration of H\u00e1kon, King of Norway, and [[Skule B\u00e5rdsson]], from [[Flateyjarb\u00f3k]]]]In 1262 there was a Scottish raid on Skye, causing [[Haakon IV]], King of Norway, to set sail for Scotland to settle the issue. Late in 1263 Haakon headed for Scotland with a large invasion force consisting of 200 ships and 15,000 men. The storms around the coast of Scotland took their toll on the Norwegian fleet, which at one point meant dragging forty ships overland to Loch Lomond. In the end a minor skirmish took place at the [[Battle of Largs]] where the Norwegians and their Manx allies under [[Magnus Olafsson|Magnus Olafsson of Mann and the Isles]] failed to achieve anything more than a minor tactical victory against the Scots led by Alexander Stewart. After the battle, bad weather forced the Norwegian-Manx fleet to sail back to the Orkney Islands. After arriving in [[Kirkwall]], Haakon decided to winter in [[Bishop's Palace, Kirkwall|Bishop's Palace]] before resuming his campaign the following summer. This failed to occur as the king was struck by illness and died in his palace in December that same year. The death of Haakon left the crown to his son [[Magnus VI of Norway|Magnus the Lawmaker]], who considered peace with the Scots more important than holding on to the Norwegian possessions off western Scotland and in the [[Irish Sea]]. The [[Treaty of Perth]] of 1266 left the Hebrides and the Isle of Man to Scotland for 4,000 marks and an annual payment of 100 marks. The treaty also included that Scotland confirmed Norwegian sovereignty over Shetland and Orkney. Still, Scottish rule over the Isle of Man was finally confirmed only after the Manx under [[Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r Magn\u00fasson]] were decisively defeated in the 1275 [[Battle of Ronaldsway]].\n\n==History of Specific Islands==\n===Barra===\n{{main|Barra}}\n[[File:Kisimul Castle.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kisimul Castle]], [[Barra]]]]The [[Clan MacNeil]] has strong ties to the Isle of [[Barra]] and can trace its lineage back to the [[O'Neill dynasty|O'Neill]]s of Ulster who came to Barra from Ireland around the year 1000.

At that time, people began to settle in permanent farms rather than following their herds.  The small houses of these people have been found throughout the [[Western Isles]], in particular, at [[Dail Mor]] in Lewis. The more striking great monuments of this period are the temples and communal burial cairns at places like [[Calanais]].\n* About 500 BC, island society moved into the [[Iron Age]]. The buildings became larger and more prominent, resulting in the [[broch]]s which were circular dry-stone towers belonging to the local chieftains, the best example of which in Lewis is at [[Dun Carloway|Dun Charlabhagh]].\n* 7th and 8th centuries AD: Christianity began to spread throughout the islands.\n* 9th century AD: The [[Vikings]] arrived, intermarrying with local families and abandoning their pagan beliefs. At this time, most buildings changed their forms from round to rectangular, following the Scandinavian style. At this time, Lewis was part of the [[Kingdom of Mann and the Isles]] and officially part of [[Norway]]. The [[Lewis chessmen]], which were found on the island in 1831, date from the time of Viking rule. The people were called the Gall-Ghaidheil, the 'Foreigner Gaels', reflecting their mixed Scandinavian/Gaelic background and probably their bilingual speech.<ref name=\"http://www.cne-siar.gov.uk/factfile/cultureheritage/history/index.htm\">[http://www.cne-siar.gov.uk/factfile/cultureheritage/history/index.htm  Local Authority Web Site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017033104/http://www.cne-siar.gov.uk/factfile/cultureheritage/history/index.htm |date=17 October 2007 }}</ref>\n* 1263 \u2013 The Battle of [[Largs]]: While not taking place in Lewis, it had a significant effect on [[Scotland]]'s defeat of the [[Viking]]s, leading to Lewis, and the rest of the Islands, being ceded to Scotland in 1266.\n* Amie MacRuari, wife of [[John of Islay]], built [[Borve Castle, Benbecula|Borve Castle]] on [[Benbecula]] Island sometime between 1344 and 1363<ref>http://www.rcahms.gov.uk/pls/portal/newcanmore.newcandig_details_gis?inumlink=9962</ref>\n* 14th century: The [[Lord of the Isles|Lordship of the Isles]] emerged as the most important power in northwestern Scotland. The Lords of the Isles were based on [[Islay]], but controlled all of the [[Hebrides]]. They were descended from [[Somerled]] (Somhairle) Mac Gillibride, a Gall-Gaidheil lord who had held the Hebrides and West Coast two hundred years earlier.\n* 18th century:  Following the 1745 rebellion, and [[Bonnie Prince Charlie|Prince Charles Edward Stewart]]'s flight to France, the use of Gaelic was discouraged, rents were demanded in cash rather than kind, and the wearing of folk dress was made illegal. Emigration to the New World increasingly became an escape for those who could afford it during the latter half of the century.\n* 19th century: Clearances by landlords forced vast numbers of people off their lands, and increased again the flood of emigrants. Lewis was the site of numerous 'land struggles' which have recently been commemorated in modern cairn-style monuments in various villages.\n* 1914\u20131918: During the [[First World War]], thousands of islanders served in the forces, many losing their lives.\n* 1919: The Isle of Lewis suffered a terrible blow with the [[Iolaire|sinking of the ''Iolaire'']] on New Year's Day at the close of the [[First World War]]. The Admiralty yacht \"HMY Iolaire\" sank within sight of Stornoway's harbour, killing over 200 naval reservists from the island who were returning home.\n* 1939\u20131945: Again, Lewis contributed to the forces during the [[Second World War]] with most serving in the [[Royal Navy|Royal]] and [[Merchant Navy]]. Again, many lives were lost. Following the war, many more inhabitants emigrated to the Americas and mainland Scotland.\n* Medieval development of Stornoway was spurred on by the construction of the original castle in the [[High Middle Ages]] by the Nicolson (or MacNicol) family of Viking descent. Infighting between rival clans continued throughout the [[Late Middle Ages]] and resisted an attempt by [[James VI]] to colonise Lewis in 1597.  The castle was destroyed by [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s forces in the mid 17th century, and the ownership of Lewis passed from the MacKenzies of Kintail through the Seaforth family and [[Sir James Matheson]] (and his descendants) to [[William Lever, 1st Viscount Leverhulme]].\n* Lord Leverhulme finally gifted the town's parish to the Stornoway Trust, whose ownership remains to this day.\n\n===North Uist===\n{{main|North Uist}}\nNorth Uist has many prehistoric structures, including the [[Barpa Langass]] [[chambered cairn]], the [[Pobull Fhinn]] [[stone circle]] and the [[Fir Bhreige]] [[standing stone]]s.\n\n===Scalpay===\n{{main|Scalpay, Outer Hebrides}}\n[[Eilean Glas, Scalpay|Eilean Glas]] a tiny peninsula on Scalpay's eastern shore is home to the first [[lighthouse]] to be built in the Outer Hebrides.\n\n===South Uist===\n{{main|South Uist}}\n[[File:South Uist.jpg|thumb|Looking west to Nicolson's Leap.

The islands were historically part of the domain of the [[Clan MacLeod|MacLeods]] of [[Harris, Outer Hebrides|Harris]] whose steward was responsible for the collection of rents in kind and other duties. The first report of a visit to the islands dates from 1549.\n\nMacaulay (1764) reports the existence of five druidic altars including a large circle of stones fixed perpendicularly in the ground, by the Stallir House on [[Boreray, St Kilda|Boreray]].<ref>Macaulay, Rev Kenneth (1764) ''History of St Kilda''. London</ref>\n\n[[File:Stkildachurch.jpg|right|thumb|The schoolroom (on the right of the photo) was added to the side of the church in 1884.]]\nVisiting ships in the 18th century brought [[cholera]] and [[smallpox]] and in 1727 the loss of life was so high that there were not enough men to man the boats and new families were brought in from [[Harris, Outer Hebrides|Harris]] to replace them. By 1758 the population had risen to 88 and reached just under 100 by the end of the century. This figure remained fairly constant until 1851 when 36 islanders emigrated to Australia on board the ''Priscilla'', a loss from which the island never fully recovered.\n\n[[File:Insidestkildachurch.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The interior of the church at Oiseabhal, St Kilda]]\nTourism had a destabilising impact on St Kilda. During the 19th century steamers began to visit Hirta, enabling the islanders to earn money from the sale of [[tweed (fabric)|tweed]]s and birds' eggs but at the expense of their self-esteem as the tourists clearly regarded them as curiosities.\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century formal schooling had become a feature of the islands and in 1906 the church was extended to make a schoolhouse. All the children now learned English in addition to their native Gaelic. Improved [[midwifery]] skills reduced the problems of childhood tetanus. There had been some talk of an evacuation in 1875 but despite occasional food shortages and a 'flu epidemic in 1913 the population was stable at 75 to 80 people, and there was no obvious sign that within a few years the millennia-old occupation of the island was to end.\n\n====World War One====\nEarly in [[World War I]] the [[Royal Navy]] erected a signal station on Hirta and daily communications with the mainland were established for the first time in St Kilda's history. In a belated response, a German submarine arrived in Village Bay on the morning of 15 May 1918 and after issuing a warning, started shelling the island. Seventy two shells in all were fired and the wireless station was destroyed. The manse, church, and jetty storehouse were also damaged.\n\nAs a result of this attack a Mark II QF gun was erected on a promontory overlooking Village Bay, but it was never [[fired in anger]]. Of greater long-term significance to the islanders was the introduction of regular contact with the outside world and the slow development of a money-based economy, both of which made life easier but less self-reliant. These were both factors in the evacuation of the island only a little more than a decade later.\n\n====Evacuation====\n[[File:Boreray and the Stacs.jpg|thumb|[[Boreray, St Kilda|Boreray]], Stac Lee, and Stac an Armin (left) from the heights of Conachair]]\nThe advent of tourism and the presence of the military in World War One had enabled the islanders to understand that there were alternatives to the privations they had routinely suffered. Despite the provision of a small jetty in 1902 the islands remained at the mercy of the weather. The authorities were unable to do much to assist them, although reliable radios and other infrastructure denied to the civilian islanders were later to be provided for the military base at a cost of millions of pounds.\n\nAfter World War One most of the young men left the island and the population fell from 73 in 1920 to 37 in 1928. After the death of four men from [[influenza]] in 1926, and a succession of crop failures in the 1920s, the last straw came with the death from [[appendicitis]] of a young woman, Mary Gillies, in January 1930. On 29 August 1930, the last 36 inhabitants were evacuated to [[Morvern]] on the Scottish mainland at their own request.\n\n====Later military events====\nIn 1955 the British government decided to incorporate St Kilda into a missile tracking range based in [[Benbecula]], where test firings and flights are carried out. Thus in 1957 St Kilda became permanently inhabited once again. A variety of new military buildings and masts have since been erected, including the island's first licensed premises, the 'Puff Inn'. The [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] leases St Kilda from the National Trust for Scotland for a nominal fee. The main island of Hirta is still occupied all year round by a small number of civilians working in the military base there.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[History of Scotland]]\n* [[Hebrides]]\n* [[Barra]]\n* [[Benbecula]]\n* [[Berneray, North Uist]]\n* [[Eriskay]]\n* [[Flannan Isles]]\n* [[Great Bernera]]\n* [[Harris, Outer Hebrides|Harris]]\n* [[Isle of Lewis]]\n* [[North Uist]]\n* [[Rockall]]\n* [[Scalpay, Outer Hebrides]]\n* [[South Uist]]\n* [[St Kilda, Scotland]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Scandinavian Scotland|state=autocollapse}}\n{{History of the British Isles|bar=yes}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History of the Outer Hebrides}}\n[[Category:Viking Age sites in Scotland]]\n[[Category:History of the Outer Hebrides]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{History of Scotland}}\n\nThe [[Hebrides]] were settled early on in the [[Prehistoric Scotland|settlement of the British Isles]], perhaps as early as the [[Mesolithic|Mesolithic era]], around 8500-8250 BC, after the climatic conditions improved enough to sustain human settlement.  There are examples of structures possibly dating from up to 3000 BC, the finest example being the standing stones at [[Callanish]], but some archaeologists date the site as [[Bronze Age]]. Little is known of the people who settled in the Hebrides but they were likely of the same [[Celts|Celtic]] stock that had settled in the rest of [[Scotland]]. Settlements at [[Northton]], [[Harris, Outer Hebrides|Harris]], have both [[Beaker culture|Beaker]] & [[Neolithic]] dwelling houses, the oldest in the [[Western Isles]], attesting to the settlement.\n\n==Celtic Era==\nThe earliest written mention of the Outer Hebrides was by the Greek historian Diodorus Siculus in 55 BC.  He wrote that there was an island called Hyperborea (which means \"Far to the North\") where a round temple stood from which the moon appeared only a little distance above the earth every 19 years, an apparent reference to the stone circle at Callanish.  Pomponius Mela, a Roman-Spanish writer of the first century, refers to a group of seven islands to which he gave the name Haemodae (Hebrides???).  Other ancient writers such as [[Pliny the Elder]], the Egyptian astronomer [[Ptolemy]], and Solinus (3 AD) all seem to mention the Hebrides, attesting to some contact of the peoples there with the Roman world.\n\nLittle is known of the history of the peoples of the Hebrides before the 6th century as they, like the rest of Scotland, were in the depths of what centuries later became known as the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]. The first written records of the islands come with the arrival of [[St. Columba]] in the 6th century. It was this Irish-Scottish saint who first brought Christianity to the islands, founding several churches.\n\n==Kingdom of the Isles==\n{{main|Kingdom of the Isles}}\nThe Kingdom of the Isles (also known as the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles) was a [[Norsemen|Norse]] [[monarchy|kingdom]] that existed in the [[British Isles]] from 1079 until 1266.\n\nThe kingdom was formed by [[Godred Crovan]] when he seized the Isle of Man from other Vikings, probably from Dublin in 1079. In the first two attempts at capturing the island Godred was defeated; it was only with his third try that he was victorious near [[Ramsey, Isle of Man|Ramsey]]. Previously, the islands had been taken between c.700-900 AD, during the Viking invasions of the British Isles. Up until the arrival of Godred the islands had been administered by the Norse Kingdoms of [[Dublin]] and [[Orkney]]. The later Kingdom of Mann was centred around the Isle of Man but also contained the Outer Hebrides, the Inner Hebrides forming the Kingdom of the Hebrides.\n\n==The Hebrides under Norse control==\nKnown as ''Su\u00f0reyar'' or southern islands in [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]]. [[Norsemen|Norse]] control of the Hebrides was formalised in 1098 when [[Edgar of Scotland]] recognised the claim of [[Magnus III of Norway]].  The Scottish acceptance of Magnus III as King of the Isles came after the Norwegian king had conquered the [[Orkney Islands]], the Hebrides and the [[Isle of Man]] in a swift campaign earlier the same year, directed against the local Norwegian leaders of the various islands.  By capturing the islands Magnus III subdued the [[Norsemen]] who had seized the islands centuries earlier and imposed a more direct royal control.\n\nThe Norwegian control of both the Inner and Outer Hebrides would see almost constant warfare until being ultimately resolved by the partitioning of the Western Isles in 1156. The Outer Hebrides would remain under the [[Kingdom of Mann and the Isles]] while the Inner Hebrides broke out under [[Somerled]], the Norse-Celtic kinsman of both [[Lulach]] and the Manx royal house. Although the Inner Hebrides, from 1156 known as the Kingdom of the Hebrides, was still nominally under the sovereignty of Norway, the leaders were Scottish in language and Gaelic in culture rather than Norse.\n\nTwo years after his victory of 1156 Somerled went on to seize control over the Isle of Man itself and become the last King of the Isle of Man and the Isles to rule over all the islands that the kingdom had once included. After Somerled's death in 1164 the rulers of Mann would no longer be in control of the Inner Hebrides.\n\n==Scottish Control==\n[[File:HakonTheOldAndSkule-Flateyjarbok.jpg|thumb|right|An illustration of H\u00e1kon, King of Norway, and [[Skule B\u00e5rdsson]], from [[Flateyjarb\u00f3k]]]]In 1262 there was a Scottish raid on Skye, causing [[Haakon IV]], King of Norway, to set sail for Scotland to settle the issue. Late in 1263 Haakon headed for Scotland with a large invasion force consisting of 200 ships and 15,000 men. The storms around the coast of Scotland took their toll on the Norwegian fleet, which at one point meant dragging forty ships overland to Loch Lomond. In the end a minor skirmish took place at the [[Battle of Largs]] where the Norwegians and their Manx allies under [[Magnus Olafsson|Magnus Olafsson of Mann and the Isles]] failed to achieve anything more than a minor tactical victory against the Scots led by Alexander Stewart. After the battle, bad weather forced the Norwegian-Manx fleet to sail back to the Orkney Islands. After arriving in [[Kirkwall]], Haakon decided to winter in [[Bishop's Palace, Kirkwall|Bishop's Palace]] before resuming his campaign the following summer. This failed to occur as the king was struck by illness and died in his palace in December that same year. The death of Haakon left the crown to his son [[Magnus VI of Norway|Magnus the Lawmaker]], who considered peace with the Scots more important than holding on to the Norwegian possessions off western Scotland and in the [[Irish Sea]]. The [[Treaty of Perth]] of 1266 left the Hebrides and the Isle of Man to Scotland for 4,000 marks and an annual payment of 100 marks. The treaty also included that Scotland confirmed Norwegian sovereignty over Shetland and Orkney. Still, Scottish rule over the Isle of Man was finally confirmed only after the Manx under [[Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r Magn\u00fasson]] were decisively defeated in the 1275 [[Battle of Ronaldsway]].\n\n==History of Specific Islands==\n===Barra===\n{{main|Barra}}\n[[File:Kisimul Castle.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kisimul Castle]], [[Barra]]]]The [[Clan MacNeil]] has strong ties to the Isle of [[Barra]] and can trace its lineage back to the [[O'Neill dynasty|O'Neill]]s of Ulster who came to Barra from Ireland around the year 1000.

There was also a certain Flann, son of an Abbot of [[Iona]] called Maol-duine who died in 890, and who may have loaned his name to these isolated isles.\n\nThe [[archipelago]] is also known as 'The Seven Hunters', and in the Middle Ages they may also have been called the 'Seven Haley (Holy) Isles'.<ref>Munro, Sir Donald (1594) ''Description of the Western Isles of Scotland''.</ref> [[Martin Martin]] (1703) lists a number of unusual customs associated with regular pilgrimages to Eilean M\u00f2r such as removing one's hat and making a [[sunwise]] turn when reaching the plateau.<ref>Martin, Martin (1703) ''[http://www.appins.org/martin.htm A Description of the Western Isles of Scotland including A Voyage to St. Kilda] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313003106/http://www.appins.org/martin.htm |date=13 March 2007 }}''</ref> It is possible that the saint or his acolytes lived on Eilean M\u00f2r and perhaps Eilean Taighe as well. However, it is unlikely that there were permanent residents on the islands once the [[Celtic Church]] fell into decline in the [[Hebrides]] (as a result of 9th century [[Viking]] invasions), until the construction of the lighthouse and its occupation very shortly before the dawn of the 20th century.\n\n===Great Bernera===\n{{main|Great Bernera}}\n[[File:CalanishVIII25.jpg|thumb|right|\"Tursachan\", the ''[[Callanish VIII]]'' megalithic monument on [[Great Bernera]] overlooks the bridge from Lewis]]\nThe main settlement on the island is [[Breaclete]] (Scottish Gaelic: ''Breacleit''), home to a small museum. Bernera is also known for its [[Iron Age]] (or possibly [[Picts|Pictish]]) settlement at Bostadh, discovered in 1992 and now covered by sand to preserve it. A replica Iron Age house matching those now buried is sited nearby. The island was also the location of the [[Bernera Riot]], where [[croft (land)|crofter]]s resisted the [[Highland clearances]].\n\n===Lewis===\n{{main|Isle of Lewis}}\n\n====Historical Sites====\n[[File:Callanish standing stones 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Callanish Stones]]]]The Isle of Lewis has a variety of locations of historical and archaeological interest including:\n* [[Callanish Stones]];\n* [[Dun Carloway]] Broch;\n* [[Iron Age]] houses near Bostadh ([[Great Bernera]]);\n* The [[Blackhouse|Black House]] village at [[Garenin]] (''Na Gearannan''), near Carloway and the Black House at [[Arnol]];\n* [[St. Columba]]'s church in [[Aignish]];\n* [[Teampull Mholuaidh]] in [[Ness, Outer Hebrides|Ness]];\n* [[Clach an Truiseil]] [[monolith]];\n* [[Bonnie Prince Charlie]]'s Monument, Arnish;\n* [[Lews Castle]];\n* [[Butt of Lewis]] cliffs and [[Butt of Lewis Lighthouse]];\n* [[D\u00f9n \u00c8istean]].\nThere are also numerous 'lesser' stone circles and remains of brochs.\n\n====Historical Events====\n[[File:UigChessmen SelectionOfKings.jpg|thumb|right|Two kings and two queens from the [[Lewis chessmen]] at the [[British Museum]]]]\n* The first evidence of human habitation of the islands is found in [[peat]] samples which indicate that about 8,000 years ago, much of the native woodland was torched to make way for grassland to allow [[deer]] to graze.\n* The earliest [[archaeology|archaeological]] remains in Lewis date from about 5,000 years ago. At that time, people began to settle in permanent farms rather than following their herds.  The small houses of these people have been found throughout the [[Western Isles]], in particular, at [[Dail Mor]] in Lewis. The more striking great monuments of this period are the temples and communal burial cairns at places like [[Calanais]].\n* About 500 BC, island society moved into the [[Iron Age]]. The buildings became larger and more prominent, resulting in the [[broch]]s which were circular dry-stone towers belonging to the local chieftains, the best example of which in Lewis is at [[Dun Carloway|Dun Charlabhagh]].\n* 7th and 8th centuries AD: Christianity began to spread throughout the islands.\n* 9th century AD: The [[Vikings]] arrived, intermarrying with local families and abandoning their pagan beliefs. At this time, most buildings changed their forms from round to rectangular, following the Scandinavian style. At this time, Lewis was part of the [[Kingdom of Mann and the Isles]] and officially part of [[Norway]]. The [[Lewis chessmen]], which were found on the island in 1831, date from the time of Viking rule. The people were called the Gall-Ghaidheil, the 'Foreigner Gaels', reflecting their mixed Scandinavian/Gaelic background and probably their bilingual speech.<ref name=\"http://www.cne-siar.gov.uk/factfile/cultureheritage/history/index.htm\">[http://www.cne-siar.gov.uk/factfile/cultureheritage/history/index.htm  Local Authority Web Site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017033104/http://www.cne-siar.gov.uk/factfile/cultureheritage/history/index.htm |date=17 October 2007 }}</ref>\n* 1263 - The Battle of [[Largs]]: While not taking place in Lewis, it had a significant effect on [[Scotland]]'s defeat of the [[Viking]]s, leading to Lewis, and the rest of the Islands, being ceded to Scotland in 1266.\n* Amie MacRuari, wife of [[John of Islay]], built [[Borve Castle, Benbecula|Borve Castle]] on [[Benbecula]] Island sometime between 1344 and 1363<ref>http://www.rcahms.gov.uk/pls/portal/newcanmore.newcandig_details_gis?inumlink=9962</ref>\n* 14th century: The [[Lord of the Isles|Lordship of the Isles]] emerged as the most important power in northwestern Scotland. The Lords of the Isles were based on [[Islay]], but controlled all of the [[Hebrides]]. They were descended from [[Somerled]] (Somhairle) Mac Gillibride, a Gall-Gaidheil lord who had held the Hebrides and West Coast two hundred years earlier.\n* 18th century:  Following the 1745 rebellion, and [[Bonnie Prince Charlie|Prince Charles Edward Stewart]]'s flight to France, the use of Gaelic was discouraged, rents were demanded in cash rather than kind, and the wearing of folk dress was made illegal. Emigration to the New World increasingly became an escape for those who could afford it during the latter half of the century.\n* 19th century: Clearances by landlords forced vast numbers of people off their lands, and increased again the flood of emigrants. Lewis was the site of numerous 'land struggles' which have recently been commemorated in modern cairn-style monuments in various villages.\n* 1914\u20131918: During the [[First World War]], thousands of islanders served in the forces, many losing their lives.\n* 1919: The Isle of Lewis suffered a terrible blow with the [[Iolaire|sinking of the ''Iolaire'']] on New Year's Day at the close of the [[First World War]]. The Admiralty yacht \"HMY Iolaire\" sank within sight of Stornoway's harbour, killing over 200 naval reservists from the island who were returning home.\n* 1939\u20131945: Again, Lewis contributed to the forces during the [[Second World War]] with most serving in the [[Royal Navy|Royal]] and [[Merchant Navy]]. Again, many lives were lost. Following the war, many more inhabitants emigrated to the Americas and mainland Scotland.\n* Medieval development of Stornoway was spurred on by the construction of the original castle in the [[High Middle Ages]] by the Nicolson (or MacNicol) family of Viking descent. Infighting between rival clans continued throughout the [[Late Middle Ages]] and resisted an attempt by [[James VI]] to colonise Lewis in 1597.  The castle was destroyed by [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s forces in the mid 17th century, and the ownership of Lewis passed from the MacKenzies of Kintail through the Seaforth family and [[Sir James Matheson]] (and his descendants) to [[William Lever, 1st Viscount Leverhulme]].\n* Lord Leverhulme finally gifted the town's parish to the Stornoway Trust, whose ownership remains to this day.\n\n===North Uist===\n{{main|North Uist}}\nNorth Uist has many prehistoric structures, including the [[Barpa Langass]] [[chambered cairn]], the [[Pobull Fhinn]] [[stone circle]] and the [[Fir Bhreige]] [[standing stone]]s.\n\n===Scalpay===\n{{main|Scalpay, Outer Hebrides}}\n[[Eilean Glas, Scalpay|Eilean Glas]] a tiny peninsula on Scalpay's eastern shore is home to the first [[lighthouse]] to be built in the Outer Hebrides.\n\n===South Uist===\n{{main|South Uist}}\n[[File:South Uist.jpg|thumb|Looking west to Nicolson's Leap.

Organisation within [[Iron Age]] [[Roundhouse (dwelling)|roundhouse]]s appears to have been very different from 19th century ''blackhouses'' in which the dwelling was shared with stock.  Stock sharing living space with people is often regarded as a traditional Hebridean arrangement reflecting [[Norsemen|Norse]] influence.<ref>Smith, H., Marshall, P. and Parker Pearson, M. 2001.

Kluwer Academic Publishers.</ref>\n\nAn excavation at Bornais on the Isle of South Uist revealed what is probably the largest Viking settlement in Scotland.\n\nThe [[archaeology|archaeological]] site of [[Cladh Hallan]] on South Uist is the only site in the British Isles where prehistoric [[mummy|mummies]] have been found.\n\n===St Kilda===\n{{main|St Kilda, Scotland}}\nSt Kilda was continuously inhabited for two millennia or more, from the Bronze Age to the 20th century.<ref>[http://www.kilda.org.uk/StKildaCultHerExtractFINALB38477.pdf St Kilda: Revised Nomination of St Kilda for inclusion in the World Heritage Site List] Retrieved 21 March 2007</ref> However, little is known of the early history, the first written record of which dates from the late 14th century. The islands were historically part of the domain of the [[Clan MacLeod|MacLeods]] of [[Harris, Outer Hebrides|Harris]] whose steward was responsible for the collection of rents in kind and other duties. The first report of a visit to the islands dates from 1549.\n\nMacaulay (1764) reports the existence of five druidic altars including a large circle of stones fixed perpendicularly in the ground, by the Stallir House on [[Boreray, St Kilda|Boreray]].<ref>Macaulay, Rev Kenneth (1764) ''History of St Kilda''. London</ref>\n\n[[File:Stkildachurch.jpg|right|thumb|The schoolroom (on the right of the photo) was added to the side of the church in 1884.]]\nVisiting ships in the 18th century brought [[cholera]] and [[smallpox]] and in 1727 the loss of life was so high that there were not enough men to man the boats and new families were brought in from [[Harris, Outer Hebrides|Harris]] to replace them. By 1758 the population had risen to 88 and reached just under 100 by the end of the century. This figure remained fairly constant until 1851 when 36 islanders emigrated to Australia on board the ''Priscilla'', a loss from which the island never fully recovered.\n\n[[File:Insidestkildachurch.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The interior of the church at Oiseabhal, St Kilda]]\nTourism had a destabilising impact on St Kilda. During the 19th century steamers began to visit Hirta, enabling the islanders to earn money from the sale of [[tweed (fabric)|tweed]]s and birds' eggs but at the expense of their self-esteem as the tourists clearly regarded them as curiosities.\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century formal schooling had become a feature of the islands and in 1906 the church was extended to make a schoolhouse. All the children now learned English in addition to their native Gaelic. Improved [[midwifery]] skills reduced the problems of childhood tetanus. There had been some talk of an evacuation in 1875 but despite occasional food shortages and a 'flu epidemic in 1913 the population was stable at 75 to 80 people, and there was no obvious sign that within a few years the millennia-old occupation of the island was to end.\n\n====World War One====\nEarly in [[World War I]] the [[Royal Navy]] erected a signal station on Hirta and daily communications with the mainland were established for the first time in St Kilda's history. In a belated response, a German submarine arrived in Village Bay on the morning of 15 May 1918 and after issuing a warning, started shelling the island. Seventy two shells in all were fired and the wireless station was destroyed. The manse, church, and jetty storehouse were also damaged.\n\nAs a result of this attack a Mark II QF gun was erected on a promontory overlooking Village Bay, but it was never [[fired in anger]]. Of greater long-term significance to the islanders was the introduction of regular contact with the outside world and the slow development of a money-based economy, both of which made life easier but less self-reliant. These were both factors in the evacuation of the island only a little more than a decade later.\n\n====Evacuation====\n[[File:Boreray and the Stacs.jpg|thumb|[[Boreray, St Kilda|Boreray]], Stac Lee, and Stac an Armin (left) from the heights of Conachair]]\nThe advent of tourism and the presence of the military in World War One had enabled the islanders to understand that there were alternatives to the privations they had routinely suffered. Despite the provision of a small jetty in 1902 the islands remained at the mercy of the weather. The authorities were unable to do much to assist them, although reliable radios and other infrastructure denied to the civilian islanders were later to be provided for the military base at a cost of millions of pounds.\n\nAfter World War One most of the young men left the island and the population fell from 73 in 1920 to 37 in 1928. After the death of four men from [[influenza]] in 1926, and a succession of crop failures in the 1920s, the last straw came with the death from [[appendicitis]] of a young woman, Mary Gillies, in January 1930. On 29 August 1930, the last 36 inhabitants were evacuated to [[Morvern]] on the Scottish mainland at their own request.\n\n====Later military events====\nIn 1955 the British government decided to incorporate St Kilda into a missile tracking range based in [[Benbecula]], where test firings and flights are carried out. Thus in 1957 St Kilda became permanently inhabited once again. A variety of new military buildings and masts have since been erected, including the island's first licensed premises, the 'Puff Inn'. The [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] leases St Kilda from the National Trust for Scotland for a nominal fee. The main island of Hirta is still occupied all year round by a small number of civilians working in the military base there.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[History of Scotland]]\n* [[Hebrides]]\n* [[Barra]]\n* [[Benbecula]]\n* [[Berneray, North Uist]]\n* [[Eriskay]]\n* [[Flannan Isles]]\n* [[Great Bernera]]\n* [[Harris, Outer Hebrides|Harris]]\n* [[Isle of Lewis]]\n* [[North Uist]]\n* [[Rockall]]\n* [[Scalpay, Outer Hebrides]]\n* [[South Uist]]\n* [[St Kilda, Scotland]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Scandinavian Scotland|state=autocollapse}}\n{{History of the British Isles|bar=yes}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History of the Outer Hebrides}}\n[[Category:Viking Age sites in Scotland]]\n[[Category:History of the Outer Hebrides]]\n", "name_user": "Dawnseeker2000", "label": "safe", "comment": "fixeddashesusing ascript", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Outer_Hebrides"}
