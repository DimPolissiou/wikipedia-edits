It is the seat of the [[Ostalbkreis]] district and is its largest town. It is also the largest town in the [[Ostw\u00fcrttemberg]] region. Since 1956, Aalen has had the status of [[Gro\u00dfe Kreisstadt]] (major district town). It is noted for its many [[half-timbered]] houses constructed from the 16th century through the 18th century.<ref name=munro/>\n\nWith an area of 146.63&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, Aalen is ranked 7th in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and 2nd within the [[Stuttgart (region)|Government Region of Stuttgart]], after Stuttgart. With a population of about 66,000, Aalen is the 15th most-populated settlement in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg.\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n== Geography ==\n=== Situation ===\n[[File:Aalen Luftbild.JPG|thumb|left|Aerial view of the district of Unterkochen (the town centre is partly covered and in the background), the Aalen lowlands well perceptible in the back]]\nAalen is situated on the upper reaches of the river [[Kocher]], at the foot of the [[Swabian Jura]] which lies to the south and south-east, and close to the hilly landscapes of the [[Ellwangen Hills]] to the north and the ''Welland'' to the north-west.\n\nThe west of Aalen's territory is on the foreland of the eastern Swabian Jura, and the north and north-west is on the [[Swabian-Franconian Forest]], both being part of the [[Swabian Keuper-Lias Plains]]. The south-west is part of the [[Albuch]], the east is part of the [[H\u00e4rtsfeld]], these two both being parts of the Swabian Jura.<ref>{{harvnb|LUBW State Institute for Environment, Measurements, and Nature Conservation Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg|2010}}</ref>\n\nThe Kocher enters the town's territory from [[Oberkochen]] to the south, crosses the district of Unterkochen, then enters the town centre, where the ''Aal'' flows into it. The ''Aal'' is a small river located only within the town's territory. Next, the Kocher crosses the district of Wasseralfingen, then leaves the town for [[H\u00fcttlingen, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg|H\u00fcttlingen]]. Rivers originating near Aalen are the [[Rems (river)|Rems]] (near [[Essingen]], west of Aalen) and the [[Jagst]] (near [[Unterschneidheim]], east of Aalen), both being tributaries of the [[Neckar]], just like the Kocher.\n\nThe elevation in the centre of the market square is {{convert|430|m|ft}} relative to [[Normalh\u00f6hennull]]. The territory's lowest point is at the [[Lein (Kocher)|Lein]] river near Rodamsd\u00f6rfle, the highest point is the Gr\u00fcnberg's peak near Unterkochen at {{convert|733|m|ft}}.<ref name=\"bauer9\">{{harvnb|Bauer|1983|p=9}}</ref>\n\n=== Geology ===\nAalen's territory ranges over all [[Group (stratigraphy)|lithostratigraphic groups]] of the [[South German Jurassic]]: Aalen's south and the ''Flexner'' massif are on top of the [[White Jurassic]], the town centre is on the [[Brown Jurassic]], and a part of Wasseralfingen is on the [[Black Jurassic]]. As a result, the town advertises itself as a \"Geologist's Mecca\".<ref>{{harvnb|Sauerborn|2002}}</ref>\n\nMost parts of the territory are on the ''Opalinuston-Formation'' (Opalinum Clay [[Formation (stratigraphy)|Formation]]) of the [[Aalenian]] subdivision of the [[Jurassic]] Period, which is named after Aalen.<ref name=munro/> On the ''Sandberg'', the ''Schnaitberg'' and the ''Schradenberg'' hills, all in the west of Aalen, the ''Eisensandstein'' (Iron Sandstone) formation emerges to the surface. On the other hills of the city, [[sand]]s ''(Goldsh\u00f6fer Sande)'', [[gravel]] and residual [[rubble]] prevail.\nThe historic centre of Aalen and the other areas in the Kocher valley are founded completely on [[Holocene|holocenic]] [[floodplain]] [[loam]] ''(Auelehm)'' and riverbed gravel that have filled in the valley.\n\nMost parts of Dewangen and Fachsenfeld are founded on formations of ''Jurensismergel'' (Jurensis [[Marl]]), ''Posidonienschiefer'' (cf. [[Posidonia Shale]]), ''Amaltheenton'' (Amalthean Clay), ''Numismalismergel'' (Numismalis Marl) and ''Obtususton'' (Obtusus Clay, named after [[Asteroceras obtusum]] ammonites) moving from south to north, all belonging to the Jurassic and being rich in fossils. They are at last followed by the ''Trossingen Formation'' already belonging to the [[Late Triassic]].\n\nUntil 1939 iron ore was mined on the ''Braunenberg'' hill. (see [[#Tiefer Stollen|Tiefer Stollen]] section).\n\n=== Extent of the borough ===\nThe maximum extent of the town's territory amounts to {{convert|18|km|mi}} in a north\u2013south dimension and {{convert|25|km|mi}} in an east\u2013west dimension.

Tools made of [[flint]] and traces of [[Mesolithic]] human settlement dated between the 8th and 5th millennium BC were found on several sites on the margins of the Kocher and Jagst valleys. On the ''Schlo\u00dfbaufeld'' plateau (appr. {{convert|650|by|350|m|ft}}), situated behind ''Kocherburg'' castle near Unterkochen, a hill-top settlement was found, with the core being dated to the [[Bronze Age]]. In the ''Appenwang'' forest near Wasseralfingen, in Goldsh\u00f6fe, and in Ebnat, [[Tumulus|tumuli]] of the [[Hallstatt culture]] were found. In Aalen and Wasseralfingen, gold and silver coins left by the [[Celts]] were found. The Celts were responsible for the fortifications in the Schlo\u00dfbaufeld settlement consisting of sectional embankments and a stone wall. Also, Near Heisenberg (Wasseralfingen), a Celtic [[nemeton]] has been identified; however it is no longer readily apparent.<ref name=\"bauer25\">{{harvnb|Bauer|1983|p=25}}</ref>\n\n==== Roman era ====\n[[File:Limesmuseum Aalen principia.jpg|thumb|The Roman fort's excavated foundation walls]]\nAfter abandoning the [[Alb Limes]] (a ''[[Limes (Roman Empire)|limes]]'' generally following the ridgeline of the Swabian Jura) around 150 [[Anno Domini|AD]], Aalen's territory became part of the [[Roman Empire]], in direct vicinity of the then newly erected [[Rhaetian Limes]]. The Romans erected a [[castrum]] to house the [[cavalry]] unit ''[[Ala (Roman military)|Ala]] II Flavia milliaria''; its remains are known today as ''Kastell Aalen'' (\"Aalen Roman fort\"). The site is west of today's town centre at the bottom of the ''Schillerh\u00f6he'' hill. With about 1,000 horsemen and nearly as many [[groom (horse)|groom]]s, it was the greatest fort of [[auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliaries]] along the Rhaetian Limes. There were Civilian settlements adjacent along the south and the east. Around 260 AD, the Romans gave up the fort as they withdrew their presence in unoccupied [[Germania]] back to the [[Rhine]] and [[Danube]] rivers, and the [[Alamanni]] took over the region.<ref name=\"ostalbkreis_315\">{{harvnb|Winter|1992|pp=315\u2013320}}</ref><ref name=\"aalen-antike\">{{harvnb|City of Aalen|2013k}}</ref> Based on 3rd- and 4th-century coins found, the civilian settlement continued to exist for the time being. However, there is no evidence of continued civilization between the Roman era and the [[Middle Ages]].<ref name=\"bauer25\"/>\n\n==== Foundation ====\nBased on discovery of alamannic graves, archaeologists have established the 7th century as the origination of Aalen. In the northern and western walls of St. John's church, which is located directly adjacent to the eastern gate of the Roman fort, Roman stones were incorporated. The building that exists today probably dates to the 9th century.\n\nThe first mention of Aalen was in 839, when emperor [[Louis the Pious]] reportedly permitted the [[Fulda monastery]] to exchange land with the Hammerstadt village, then known as ''Hamarstat''.<ref name=\"ostalbkreis_123\">{{harvnb|Winter|1992|p=123}}</ref>\nAalen itself was first mentioned in an inventory list of [[Ellwangen Abbey]], dated ca. 1136, as the village ''Alon'', along with a lower nobleman named Conrad of Aalen. This nobleman probably had his ancestral castle at a site south of today's town centre and was subject first to Ellwangen abbey, later to the [[House of Hohenstaufen]], and eventually to the [[House of Oettingen]]. 1426 was the last time a member of that house was mentioned in connection with Aalen.\nDocuments, from the Middle Ages, indicate that the town of Aalen was founded by the Hohenstaufen some time between 1241 and 1246, but at a different location than the earlier village, which was supposedly destroyed in 1388 during the war between the Alliance of Swabian Cities and the Dukes of Bavaria.\nLater, it is documented that the counts of Oettingen ruled the town in 1340. They are reported to have pawned the town to Count [[Eberhard II, Count of W\u00fcrttemberg|Eberhard II]] and subsequently to the [[House of W\u00fcrttemberg]] in 1358 or 1359 in exchange for an amount of money.<ref name=\"bauer82\">{{harvnb|Bauer|1983|p=82}}</ref>\n\n==== Imperial City ====\n{{Infobox country\n|native_name = ''Reichsstadt Aalen''\n|conventional_long_name = Imperial City of Aalen\n|common_name = Aalen\n|era = Early modern period\n|status = [[Imperial State|Imperial Estate]]\n|empire = Holy Roman Empire\n|government_type = Republic\n|year_start = 1360\n|year_end = 1803\n|event_pre = Town founded\n|date_pre = 13th century\n|event_start = Gained [[Imperial immediacy]]\n|date_start =\n|event1 = [[Protestant Reformation]]\n|date_event1 = 1575\n|event2 = [[Counter-Reformation]]\n|date_event2 = 1628\u201332\n|event3 = Devastated by fire\n|date_event3 = 1634\n|event_end = [[German Mediatisation|Mediatised]] to [[Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg|W\u00fcrttemberg]]\n|date_end =\n|p1 = County of Oettingen\n|flag_p1 = 0193 Oettingen evetezett alapon pajzs \u00e9s har\u00e1ntkereszt.svg\n|border_p1 = no\n|p2 = County of W\u00fcrttemberg\n|flag_p2 = Wuerttemberg Arms.svg\n|border_p2 = no\n|s1 = Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg\n|flag_s1 = Wappen Herzogtum W\u00fcrttemberg.svg\n|border_s1 = no\n|capital = Aalen\n|footnotes = Before 1360, the town belonged to the [[County of Oettingen|Counts of Oettingen]] who pawned them into the [[County of W\u00fcrttemberg]] in 1358 or 1359.\n}}\n\n===== Designation as Imperial City =====\nDuring the war against W\u00fcrttemberg, Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] took the town without a fight after a siege. On 3 December 1360, he declared Aalen an [[Free imperial city|Imperial City]], that is, a city or town responsible only to the emperor, a status that made it a quasi-sovereign city-state and that it kept until 1803.<ref>{{harvnb|Canby|1984|p=1}}</ref> In 1377, Aalen joined the Alliance of Swabian Cities, and in 1385, the term ''civitas'' appears in the town's seal for the first time. In 1398, Aalen was granted the right to hold markets, and in 1401 Aalen obtained proper jurisdiction.\n\n[[File:Aalen 1528.jpg|thumb|Town view of 1528]]\nThe oldest artistic representation of Aalen was made in 1528. It was made as the basis of a lawsuit between the town and the Counts of Oettingen at the [[Reichskammergericht]] in Speyer. It shows Aalen surrounded by walls, towers, and double moats. The layout of the moats, which had an embankment built between them, is recognizable by the present streets named ''N\u00f6rdlicher, \u00d6stlicher, S\u00fcdlicher'' and ''Westlicher Stadtgraben'' (Northern, Eastern, Southern and Western Moat respectively). The wall was about {{convert|6|m|ft}} tall, 1518 [[Pace (unit)|single paces]] ({{convert|990|m|ft}}) long and enclosed an area of {{convert|5.3|ha|acre}}. During its early years, the town had two [[town gate]]s: The ''Upper'' or ''[[Ellwangen]] Gate'' in the east, and St. Martin's gate in the south; however due to frequent floods, St. Martin's gate was bricked up in the 14th century and replaced by the ''Lower'' or ''[[Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd|Gm\u00fcnd]] Gate'' built in the west before 1400. Later, several minor side gates were added. The central street market took place on the ''Wettegasse'' (today called ''Marktplatz'', \"market square\") and the ''Reichsst\u00e4dter Stra\u00dfe''. So the market district stretched from one gate to the other, however in Aalen it was not straight, but with a 90-degree curve between southern (St. Martin's) gate and eastern (Ellwangen) gate.\n\nAround 1500, the civic graveyard was relocated from the town church to St. John's Church,<ref name=\"bauer82\"/> and in 1514, the ''Vierundzwanziger'' (\"Group of 24\") was the first assembly constituted by the citizens.\n\n===== Reformation =====\nDelegated by W\u00fcrttemberg's Duke [[Louis III, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Louis III]], on 28 June 1575, nearly 30 years after [[Martin Luther]]'s death, [[Jakob Andreae]], professor and chancellor of the [[University of T\u00fcbingen]], arrived in Aalen. The sermon he gave the following day convinced the mayor, the council, and the citizens to adopt the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in the town. Andreae stayed in Aalen for four weeks to help with the change.<ref name=\"bauer82\"/> This brought along enormous changes, as the council forbade the Roman Catholic priests to celebrate masses and give sermons. However, after victories of the imperial armies at the beginning of the [[Thirty Years' War]], the [[Prince-Provost]]ry of Ellwangen, which still held the [[Jus patronatus|right of patronage]] in Aalen, were able to temporarily bring Catholicism back to Aalen; however after the military successes of the [[Protestant Union]], Protestant church practices were instituted again.\n\n===== Fire of 1634 =====\nOn the night of 5 September 1634,<ref name = GA>{{harvnb|Geschichtsverein Aalen (Historical Society of Aalen)|2013}}</ref> two ensigns of the army of [[Bernard of Saxe-Weimar]] who were fighting with the Swedes and retreating after the [[Battle of N\u00f6rdlingen (1634)|Battle of N\u00f6rdlingen]] set fire to two powder carriages, to prevent the war material to fall into Croatian hands and to prevent their advance. The result was a conflagration, that some say destroyed portions of the town. There are differing stories regarding this fire. According to 17th-century accounts, the church and all the buildings, except of the ''Schw\u00f6rturm'' tower, were casualties of the fire, and only nine families survived. 19th century research by Hermann Bauer, Lutheran pastor and local historian, discovered that the 17th-century account is exaggerated, but he does agree that the town church and buildings in a \"rather large\" semicircle around it were destroyed. The fire also destroyed the town archive housed in an addition to the church, with all of its documents.<ref name=\"bauer82\"/> After the fire, soldiers of both armies went through the town looting.<ref>{{harvnb|Anon|2013a}}</ref> It took nearly 100 years for the town to reach its population of 2,000.\n\n[[File:Free Imperial City of Aalen.JPG|thumb|Territory of the Imperial City of Aalen]]\n\nFrench troops marched through Aalen in 1688 during the [[Nine Years' War]]; however, unlike other places, they left without leaving severe damages. The French came through again in 1702 during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] and in 1741 during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]],<ref name=\"bauer82\"/> the latter also caused imperial troops to move through in 1743.<ref>{{harvnb|Bauer|2012|p=135}}</ref>\n\nThe town church's tower collapsed in 1765, presumably because proper building techniques were not utilized during the reconstruction after the fire of 1634. The collapsing tower struck two children of the tower watchman who died of their injuries, and destroyed the nave, leaving only the altar cross intact. The remaining walls had to be knocked down due to the damage. Reconstruction began the same year, creating the building that exists today.<ref name=\"bauer82\"/>\n\nOn 22 November 1749, the so-called ''Aalen protocol'' regulating the cohabitation of Lutherans and Roman Catholics in the jointly ruled territory of Oberkochen was signed in Aalen by the Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg and the Prince-Provostry of Ellwangen. Aalen had been chosen because of its neutral status as a Free Imperial City.\n\n===== Napoleonic era and end of the Imperial City of Aalen =====\n[[File:Angriff auf Aalen 1796.jpg|thumb|French attack on Aalen of 1796]]\nDuring the [[War of the First Coalition]] (1796), Aalen was looted.<ref name=\"bauer82\"/> The War of the Second Coalition concluded in 1801 with the signing of the [[Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville]], which led to the [[German Mediatisation]] of 1803 that assigned most Imperial Cities to the neighbouring principalities. Aalen was assigned to the [[Prince-elector|electorate]] of W\u00fcrttemberg, which later became the Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg, and became seat of the District (\"Oberamt\") of Aalen. During the [[War of the Third Coalition]], on 6 October 1805, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] arrived in Aalen, with an army of 40,000. This event, along with Bavarian and Austrian troops moving in some days later, caused miseries that according to the town clerk \"no feather could describe\".<ref name=\"bauer145\">{{harvnb|Bauer|1983|p=145}}</ref>\n\nIn 1811, the municipality of Unterrombach was formed out of some villages previously belonging to Aalen, some to the Barons of W\u00f6llwarth, and the eastern villages were assigned to the municipality of Unterkochen.\n\nIn the age of the Napoleonic wars, the [[town wall]]s were no longer of use, and in the 18th century, with the maintenance of walls, gates and towers becoming more neglected Finally, due to the fact that the funds were lacking, starting in 1800, most towers were demolished, the other buildings followed soon.<ref name=\"bauer145\"/>\n\n==== Industrial revolution ====\n[[File:Aalen nach 1861.jpg|thumb|Railway station and town after 1861]]\nBefore the [[industrial revolution]], Aalen's economy was shaped by its rural setting. Many citizens were pursuing farming besides their craft, such as [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]]. In the mid 19th century, there were twelve tanneries in Aalen, due to the proximity of [[Ulm]], an important sales market. Other crafts that added to the economy were [[Weaving|weaving mills]], which produced linen and woolen goods, and baking of sweet pastry and gingerbread.<ref name=\"bauer122\">{{harvnb|Bauer|1983|p=122}}</ref><ref name=\"eb1911\">{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911|p=2}}</ref>\n\nIn Aalen, industrialisation was a slow process. The first major increase was in the 1840s, when three factories for [[Nail (fastener)|nails]] and some other factories emerged.<ref name=\"bauer122\"/> It was the link with the railway network, by the opening of the [[Rems Railway]] from [[Cannstatt]] to Wasseralfingen in 1861, that brought more industry to Aalen, along with the royal [[steel mill]] (later ''Schw\u00e4bische H\u00fcttenwerke'') in Wasseralfingen. The Rems Railway's extension to N\u00f6rdlingen in 1863, the opening of the [[Brenz Railway]] in 1864 and of the [[Upper Jagst Railway]] in 1866 turned Aalen into a [[railway hub]]. Furthermore, between 1901 and its shutdown in 1972, the [[H\u00e4rtsfeld Railway]] connected Aalen with [[Dillingen an der Donau]] via [[Neresheim]]. Part of becoming a rail hub entailed more jobs based on the rail industry. These included, a maintenance facility, a [[Railway roundhouse|roundhouse]], an administrative office, two track maintenance shops, and a freight station with an industrial [[branch line]]. This helped shape Aalen into what today's historians call a \"railwayman's town\".<ref name=\"Hafner Stadtf\u00fchrer\">{{harvnb|Hafner|1989|p=5}}</ref> Starting in 1866, the utilities in town all began to be upgraded. Starting with the Aalen [[gasworks]] which were opened and [[gas lighting]] was introduced. Then in 1870, a modern [[water supply]] system was started and in 1912 the [[mains electricity]]. Finally, in 1935, the first electrically powered [[street light]]s were installed.<ref name=\"bauer122\"/>\n\n[[File:Aalen-um-1900.jpg|thumb|left|Aalen by 1900]]\nTo fight housing shortage during and immediately after [[World War I]], the town set up barracks settlement areas at the ''Schlauch'' and ''Alter Turnplatz'' grounds. In spite of the industry being crippled by the [[Great Depression]] of 1929, the public baths at the Hirschbach creek where modernized, extended and re-opened in 1931.<ref name=\"Hafner Stadtf\u00fchrer\" />\n\n==== Nazi era ====\nIn the [[German federal election, November 1932|federal election of 1932]], the [[Nazi Party]] performed below average in Aalen with 25.8% of votes compared to 33.1% on the national level, thus finishing second to the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]] which had 26.6% (11.9% nationwide) of the votes, and ahead of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] with 19.8% (20.4%). However, the [[German federal election, March 1933|March 1933 federal elections]] showed that the sentiment had changed as the Nazi Party received 34.1% (still below German average 43.9% nationwide), but by far the leading vote-getter in Aalen, followed by the Centre party at 26.6% (11.3% nationwide) and the Social Democrats 18.6% (18.3% nationwide).<ref>{{harvnb|Bauer|1984|p=273}}</ref>\n\nThe democratically elected mayor Friedrich Schwarz remained in office until the Nazis removed him from office, in 1934, and replaced him by chairman of the Nazi Party town council head and brewery owner Karl Barth. Karl Barth was a provisional mayor until the more permanent solution of Karl Sch\u00fcbel. In August 1934, the Nazi consumer fair [[Braune Messe]] (\"brown fair\") was held in Aalen.<ref name=\"Braune Messe\">{{harvnb|Anon|1934}}</ref>\n\nDuring [[Nazi Germany|Nazi rule in Germany]], there were many military offices constructed in Aalen, starting with, in 1936, a [[military district (Germany)|military district]] riding and driving school. The Nazis also built an army replenishment office ''(Heeresverpflegungsamt)'', a branch arsenal office ''(Heeresnebenzeugamt)'' and a branch army ammunitions institute ''(Heeresnebenmunitionsanstalt)''.\n\nStarting in 1935, [[Merger (politics)|mergers]] of neighbouring towns began. In 1938, the Oberamt was transformed into the [[Districts of Germany|Landkreis]] of Aalen and the municipality of Unterrombach was disbanded. Its territory was mostly added to Aalen, with the exception of Hammerstadt, which was added to the municipality of Dewangen. Forst, Rauental and Vogelsang were added to Essingen (in 1952 the entire former municipality of Unterrombach was merged into Aalen, with the exception of Forst, which is part of Essingen until present).\n\nIn September 1944, the ''Wiesendorf'' [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]], a [[List of subcamps of Natzweiler-Struthof|subcamp]] of [[Natzweiler-Struthof]], was constructed nearby. It was designated for between 200 and 300 prisoners who were utilized for [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labor in industrial businesses]] nearby. Until the camp's dissolution in February 1945, 60 prisoners died.<ref name=\"Sch\u00e4tzle\">{{harvnb|Sch\u00e4tzle|1980|p=66}}</ref> Between 1946 and 1957, the camp buildings were torn down; however, its foundations are still in place in house ''Moltkestra\u00dfe 44/46''. Also, there were several other labour camps which existed where prisoners of war along with women and men from occupied countries occupied by Germany were pooled. The prisoners at these other camps had to work for the arms industry in major businesses like ''Schw\u00e4bische H\u00fcttenwerke'' and the ''Alfing Ke\u00dfler'' machine factory.<ref name=\"gedenkstaetten\">{{harvnb|Puvogel|Stankowski|Graf|1995|p=20}}</ref>\n\nIn the civic hospital, the [[deaconess]]es on duty were gradually replaced by [[National Socialist People's Welfare]] nurses. [[Nazi eugenics]] led to [[compulsory sterilization]] of some 200 persons there.<ref name=\"Einhorn 140\">{{harvnb|Nu\u00dfbaumer|2008|p=297}}</ref>\n\nFortunately, Aalen avoided most of the combat activity during [[World War II]]. It was only during the last weeks of the war that Aalen became a target of [[Air warfare of World War II|air warfare]], which led to the destruction and severe damage of parts of the town, the train station, and other railway installations. A series of air attacks lasting for more than three weeks reached its peak on 17 April 1945, when [[United States Army Air Forces]] planes bombed the branch arsenal office and the train station. During this raid, 59 people were killed, more than half of them buried by debris, and more than 500 lost their homes.<ref name=\"Aalen Luftangriffe\">{{harvnb|City of Aalen|2013l}}</ref> Also, 33&nbsp;residential buildings, 12&nbsp;other buildings and 2&nbsp;bridges were destroyed, and 163&nbsp;buildings, including 2&nbsp;churches, were damaged.<ref name=\"bauer145\"/> Five days later, the Nazi rulers of Aalen were unseated by the US forces.\n\n==== Post-war era ====\nAalen became part of the State of [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], upon its creation in 1952. Then, with the Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg territorial reform of 1973, the District of Aalen was merged into the [[Ostalbkreis]] district. Subsequently, Aalen became seat of that district, and in 1975, the town's borough attained its present size ([[#Mergings|see below]]).\n\nThe population of Aalen exceeded the limit of 20,000, which was the requirement for to gain the status of [[Gro\u00dfe Kreisstadt]] (\"major district town\") in 1946. On 1 August 1947, Aalen was declared ''Unmittelbare Kreisstadt'' (\"immediate district town\"), and with the creation of the [[Gemeindeordnung]] (municipal code) of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg on 1 April 1956, it was declared ''Gro\u00dfe Kreisstadt''.\n\n=== Religions ===\nOn 31 December 2008, 51.1&nbsp;percent of Aalen were members of the [[Catholic Church]], 23.9&nbsp;percent were members of the [[Evangelical-Lutheran Church in W\u00fcrttemberg|Evangelical-Lutheran Church]]. About 25&nbsp;percent belong to other or no religious community or gave no information.<ref>{{harvnb|City of Aalen|2010}}</ref> The district of Waldhausen was the district with the highest percentage of Roman Catholic inhabitants at 75.6&nbsp;percent, and the central district was the one with the highest percentage of Evangelical-Lutheran inhabitants at 25.6&nbsp;percent, as well as those claiming no religious preference at 32.5&nbsp;percent.<ref name=\"stat. Jahrbuch\"/>\n\n==== Protestantism ====\nAalen's population originally was subject to the [[jus patronatus]] of Ellwangen Abbey, and thus subject to the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Augsburg]].\n\nWith the assistance of the Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg, in 1575, the [[reformation]] was implemented in Aalen. Subsequently, Aalen has been a predominantly Protestant town for centuries, with the exception of the years from 1628 until 1632 (see [[#Reformation|reformation]] section). Being an Imperial City, Aalen could govern its clerical matters on its own, so Clerics, organists and choir masters were direct subjects to the council, which thus exerted bishop-like power. There was even a proper hymn book for Aalen.<ref name=\"bauer82\"/> After the transition to W\u00fcrttemberg, in 1803, Aalen became seat of a [[deanery]], with the dean church being the Town Church (with the building constructed from 1765 to 1767 and existing until present). Another popular church is [[John the Baptist|St. John's]] Church, located on the cemetery and refurbished in 1561.\n\nAs Aalen's population grew in the 20th century, more parishes were founded: [[Mark the Evangelist|St. Mark's]] parish with its church building of 1967 and [[Martin of Tours|St. Martin's]] parish with its church of 1974. In the borough of Unterrombach, Aalen had implemented the [[reformation]] as well, but the community remained a [[chapel of ease|chapel-of-ease]] of Aalen. A proper church, the Christ Church, was erected in 1912 and a proper parish was established in 1947. In Fachsenfeld, the ruling family of Woellwarth resp. of Leinroden implemented the reformation. A parish church was built in 1591, however with an influx of Catholics in the 18th century, a Catholic majority was established. The other districts of present-day Aalen remained mostly catholic after the reformation, however Wasseralfingen established a Lutheran parish in 1891 and a church, St. Magdalene's Church, in 1893. In Unterkochen, after World War II, a parish was established and a church was built in 1960. All four parishes belong to the deanery of Aalen within the [[Evangelical-Lutheran Church in W\u00fcrttemberg]]. Furthermore, in Aalen there are [[Pietism|Old Pietistic]] communities.\n\n==== Catholicism ====\n[[File:Salvatorkirche aalen.jpg|thumb|upright|Salvator's Church]]\nThe few Catholics of today's central district were covered by the parish of Unterkochen until the 19th century, a situation which continued for some years even after completion of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|St. Mary's]] Church in 1868, which was constructed by [[Georg Morlok]].<ref name=\"bauer145\"/> However, in 1872 Aalen got its proper parish again, and in 1913, a second Catholic church, Salvator's Church, was completed, and in 1969 the Holy Cross Church was also finished. In 1963, a second parish was set up, and in 1972 it got a new Church, the new St. Mary's Church, which has been erected in place of the old St. Mary's church, which had been torn down in 1968. Another church of the second parish was St. Augustine's Church, which was completed in 1970. Finally, in 1976 and 1988, St. Elizabeth's Church and St. Thomas' Church were completed. Furthermore, in 1963, the St. Michael pastoral care office was built.\n\nHofherrnweiler has its own Catholic church, [[Saint Boniface|St. Boniface's]], since 1904. The villages of Dewangen, Ebnat, Hofen, Waldhausen and Wasseralfingen had remained Catholic after reformation, so old parishes and churches persist there. The ''Assumption of Mary'' Church in Dewangen has an [[Gothic art|early Gothic]] tower and a newly built nave (1875). [[Immaculate Conception|Mary's Immaculate Conception]] Church in Ebnat was constructed in 1723; however the church was first mentioned in 1298.\n\n[[File:Marienwallfahrtskirche Unterkochen.jpg|thumb|upright|St. Mary, Unterkochen]]\nHofen's [[Saint George]]'s Church is a [[fortified church]], whose current nave was built between 1762 and 1775.<ref>{{harvnb|Simla|2005}}</ref> Alongside the church, the Late Gothic [[Odile of Alsace|St. Odile's]] Chapel is standing, whose entrance has the year 1462 engraved upon it. Foundations of prior buildings have been dated to the 11th and 13th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Simla|2005a}}</ref>\n\nSt. Mary's Church of Unterkochen was first mentioned in 1248, and has served the Catholics of Aalen for a long time. Waldhausen's parish church of [[Saint Nicholas|St. Nicholas]] was built between 1699 and 1716. Wasseralfingen at first was a [[chapel of ease]] for Hofen, but has since had its own chapel, [[Saint Stephen|St. Stephen]], built. It was presumably built in 1353 and remodeled in 1832. In 1834, a proper parish was established, which built a new St. Stephen's Church. This new building utilized the [[Romanesque Revival architecture]] style and was built between 1881 and 1883, and has since remained the parish's landmark. Also, Fachsenfeld received its own church, named [[Sacred Heart]] in 1895. All Catholic parishes within Aalen are today incorporated into four pastoral care units within the ''Ostalb'' Deanery of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Rottenburg-Stuttgart|Diocese of Rottenburg-Stuttgart]]; however these units also comprise some parishes outside of Aalen. Pastoral Care Unit two comprises the parishes of Essingen, Dewangen and Fachsenfeld, unit four comprises Hofen and Wasseralfingen, unit five comprises both parishes of Aalen's centre and Hofherrnweiler, unit five comprises Waldhausen, Ebnat, Oberkochen and Unterkochen.{{clarify|date=April 2013}}\n\n==== Other christian communities ====\nIn addition to the two major religions within Aalen, there are also [[free church]]es and other communities, including the [[United Methodist Church]], the [[Baptists]], the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] and the [[New Apostolic Church]].\n\n==== Other religions ====\nUntil the late 19th century, no [[Jew]]s were documented within Aalen. In 1886 there were four Jews were living in Aalen, a number that rose to ten in 1900, fell to seven in 1905, and remained so until 1925. Upon the Nazis' rise to power in 1933, seven Jews, including two children, lived in Aalen.<ref name=\"Juden 1984\">{{harvnb|Bauer|1984|pp=302\u2013344}}</ref> During the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, the vitrines of the three Jewish shops in the town were smashed and their proprietors imprisoned for several weeks. After their release, most Aalen Jews emigrated. The last Jews of Aalen, Fanny Kahn, was forcibly resettled to [[Oberdorf am Ipf]], which had a large Jewish community. Today, a street of Aalen is named after her. The Jew Max Pfeffer returned from Brussels to Aalen in 1948 to continue his shop, but emigrated to Italy in 1967.<ref name=\"Juden 1984\"/>\n\nIn Aalen, there is an Islamic [[Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs|Ditib]] community, which maintains the ''D.I.T.I.B. Mosque of Aalen (Central Mosque)'' located at Ulmer Stra\u00dfe.<ref name=\"Moscheesuche Ditib\">{{harvnb|Anon|2013b}}</ref> The mosque's construction started on 30 August 2008. The [[Mill\u00ee G\u00f6r\u00fc\u015f]] organisation maintains the [[Mehmed II|Fatih]] Mosque, as well at Ulmer Stra\u00dfe.<ref name=\"Moscheesuche IGMG\">{{harvnb|Anon|2013c}}</ref>\n\n==== Mergings ====\nThe present-day make up of Aalen was created on 21 June 1975 by the unification of the cities of Aalen and Wasseralfingen,<ref name=munro>{{harvnb|Munro|1995|p=1}}</ref> with the initial name of ''Aalen-Wasseralfingen''. This annexation made Aalen's territory one third larger than its prior size. On 1 July 1975, the name ''Aalen'' was revived. Prior to this merger, the town of Aalen had already annexed the following municipalities:\n* 1938: Unterrombach\n* 1 January 1970: Waldhausen\n* 1 July 1972: Ebnat\n* 1 January 1973: Dewangen, Fachsenfeld (including the village of Hangendenbach, which was transferred from Abtsgm\u00fcnd in 1954) and Unterkochen. The merging of Dewangen nearly doubled the territory of Aalen.\n\n=== Population\u2019s progression and structure ===\n[[File:Population development Aalen.png|thumb|upright=2|Progression of Aalen's population]]\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[early modern period]], Aalen was just a small town with a few hundred inhabitants. The population grew slowly due to numerous wars, famines and epidemics. It was the beginning of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the 19th century where Aalen's growth accelerated. Whereas in 1803, only 1,932 people inhabited the town, in 1905 it had already increased to 10,442. The number continued to rise and reached 15,890 in 1939.\n\nThe influx of refugees and [[Heimatvertriebene|ethnic Germans]] from Germany's former eastern territories after [[World War II]] pushed the population to 31,814 in 1961. The merger with Wasseralfingen on 21 June 1975 added 14,597 persons and resulted in a total population of 65,165 people. On 30 June 2005, the population, which was officially determined by the [[List of statistical offices in Germany|Statistical Office of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], was 67,125.\n\nThe following overview shows how the population figures of the borough were ascertained. Until 1823, the figures are mostly estimates, thereafter census results or official updates by the state statistical office. Starting in 1871, the figures were determined by non-uniform method of tabulation using extrapolation.\n\n{|\n| valign=\"top\" |\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year\n!

In the 16th century, the town had two, sometimes three mayors, and in 1552, the council had 13 members. Later, the head of the administration was reorganized several times. In the W\u00fcrttemberg era, the mayor's title was initially called ''B\u00fcrgermeister'', then from 1819 it was [[Schulthei\u00df]], and since 1947 it is ''Oberb\u00fcrgermeister''. The mayor is elected for a term of eight years, and he is chairman and a voting member of the council. He has one deputy with the official title of ''Erster B\u00fcrgermeister'' (\"first mayor\") and one with the official title of ''B\u00fcrgermeister'' (\"mayor\").\n[[File:Aalen Flag.svg|thumb|upright|Flag of Aalen]]\n'''Heads of town in Aalen since 1802'''\n* 1802\u2013{{0|0000}}: Theodor Betzler\n* 1812\u20131819: Ludwig H\u00f6lder\n* 1819\u20131829: Theodor Betzler\n* 1829:{{0|\u20130000}} Palm\n* 1829\u20131848: Philipp Ehmann\n* 1848\u20131873: Gustav Oesterlein\n* 1873\u20131900: Julius Bausch\n* 1900\u20131902: Paul Maier\n* 1903\u20131934: Friedrich Schwarz\n* 1935\u20131945: [[Karl Sch\u00fcbel]]\n* 1945\u20131950: [[Otto Balluff]]\n* 1950\u20131975: Karl Sch\u00fcbel\n* 1976\u20132005: [[Ulrich Pfeifle]] ([[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]])\n* 2005\u20132013: [[Martin Gerlach]] (independent)\n* 2013\u2013{{0|0000}}: [[Thilo Rentschler]] ([[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]])\n\n=== Coat of arms and flag ===\n[[File:Stadtwappen Aalen 1766.JPG|thumb|100px|left|Coat of arms of 1766 with eagle and eel]]\nAalen's [[coat of arms]] depicts a black eagle with a red tongue on golden background, having a red shield on its breast with a bent silver [[eel]] on it. Eagle and eel were first acknowledged as Aalen's heraldic animals in the seal of 1385, with the eagle representing the town's [[imperial immediacy]].<ref name=\"bauer9\"/> After the territorial reform, it was bestowed again by the [[Stuttgart (region)|Administrative District of Stuttgart]] on 16 November 1976.\n\nThe coat of arms' [[blazon]] reads: \u201cIn gold, the black imperial eagle, with a red breast shield applied to it, therein a bent silver eel\u201d ''(In Gold der schwarze Reichsadler, belegt mit einem roten Brustschild, darin ein gekr\u00fcmmter silberner Aal)''.\n\nAalen's flag is striped in red and white and contains the coat of arms.\n\nThe origin of the town's name is uncertain. [[Matth\u00e4us Merian]] (1593\u20131650) presumed the name to originate from its location at the Kocher river, where \"frequently eels are caught\", while ''Aal'' is German for \"eel\". Other explanations point to Aalen as the garrison of an [[Ala (Roman allied military unit)|ala]] during the Roman empire, respectively to an abridgement of the Roman name \"Aquileia\" as a potential name of the Roman fort, a name that nearby [[Heidenheim an der Brenz]] bore as well. Another interpretation points to a Celtic word '''aa''' meaning \"water\".<ref name=\"bauer9\"/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Twin towns \u2013 sister cities===\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Germany}}\nThe \"Twin Cities Society of Aalen\" ''(St\u00e4dtepartnerschaftsverein Aalen e.&nbsp;V.)'' promotes \"friendly relations\" between Aalen and its [[Twin towns and sister cities|twin cities]],<ref>{{harvnb|City of Aalen|2013m}}</ref> which comprises mutual exchanges of sports and cultural clubs, schools and other civic institutions.

It opened in 1964.<ref name=EB>{{harvnb|Hoiberg|2010|p=2}}</ref> The museum exhibits numerous objects from the Roman era. The ruins of the cavalry fort located beside the museum is open to museum visitors. Every other year, a Roman festival is held in the area of the museum ([[#Roman Festival|see below]]).\n\nIn the Geological-Paleontological Museum located in the historic town hall, there are more than 1500 fossils from the Swabian Jura, including [[ammonite]]s, [[ichthyosaur]]s and [[coral]]s, displayed.\n\nIn the Waldhausen district the ''Heimatst\u00fcble'' museum of local history has an exhibition on agriculture and rural living.\n\nIn the Wasseralfingen district, there are two more museums: The ''Museum Wasseralfingen'' comprises a local history exhibition and an art gallery including works of [[Hermann Plock]], [[Helmut Schuster]] and [[Sieger K\u00f6der]]. Also, the [[stove]] plate collection of the ''Schw\u00e4bische H\u00fcttenwerke'' steel mill is exhibited, with artists, modellers and the production sequence of a cast plate from design to final product being presented.\n\n==== Memorial sites ====\n[[File:Gedenkstein Schillerlinde Wasseralfingen.jpg|thumb|upright|Memorial stone at ''Schillerlinde'']]\nThere is memorial stone at the ''Schillerlinde'' tree above Wasseralfingen's ore pit dedicated to four prisoners of the subcamp of Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp killed there. Also in Wasseralfingen, in the cemetery a memorial with the Polish inscription \"To the victims of Hitler\" which commemorates the deceased forced labourers buried there.<ref name=\"gedenkstaetten\" />\n\nIn 1954, on the ''Schillerh\u00f6he'' hill the town erected a bell tower as a memorial to Aalen's victims of both world wars and to the [[Heimatvertriebene|displacement of ethnic Germans]]. The tower was planned by [[Emil Leo]], the bell was endowed by Carl Schneider. The tower is open on request. Every evening at 18:45 (before 2003: at 19:45), the memorial's bell rings.<ref>{{harvnb|City of Aalen|2004}}</ref>\n\n=== Buildings ===\n==== Churches ====\n[[File:Johanneskirche Aalen.jpg|thumb|St. John's Church]]\n[[File:St. Stephanus, Wasseralfingen.jpg|thumb|upright|St. Stephen's Church, Wasseralfingen]]\nThe town centre is dominated by the Evangelical-Lutheran [[Saint Nicholas|St. Nicholas']] Church in the heart of the pedestrian area. The church, in its present shape being built between 1765 and 1767, is the only major [[Rococo|Late Baroque]] building in Aalen and is the main church of the Evangelical-Lutheran parish of Aalen.\n\n''St. John's Church'' is located inside of St. John's cemetery in the western centre. The building presumably is from the 9th century and thus is one of W\u00fcrttemberg's oldest existing churches. The interior features [[fresco]]s from the early 13th century.\n\nFor other churches in Aalen, see the [[#Religions|Religions]] section.\n\n==== Historic Town Hall with \"Spy\" ====\n[[File:Spionturm Aalen.jpg|thumb|upright|\"Spy's Tower\"]]\nThe Historic Town Hall was originally built in the 14th century. After the fire of 1634, it was re-constructed in 1636. This building received a clock from Lauterburg,<ref name=\"bauer82\"/> and the Imperial City of [[Nuremberg]] donated a [[Carillon]]. It features a figurine of the \"Spy of Aalen\" and historically displayed other figurines, however the latter ones were lost by a fire in 1884. Since then, the Spy resides inside the reconstructed tower and has become a symbol of the town. The building was used as the town hall until 1907. Since 1977, the Geological-Paleontological Museum resides in the Historic Town Hall.<ref name=\"Citybummel\">{{harvnb|City of Aalen|2013r}}</ref>\n\nAccording to legend, the citizens of Aalen owe the \"Spy of Aalen\" ''(Spion von Aalen)'' their town having been spared from destruction by the emperor's army:\n\n<blockquote>The Imperial City of Aalen once was were in quarrel with the emperor, and his army was shortly before the gates to take the town. The people of Aalen got scared and thus dispatched their \u201cmost cunning\u201d one out into the enemy\u2019s camp to spy out the strength of their troops. Without any digression, he went straight into the middle of the enemy camp, which inescapably led to him being seized and presented to the emperor. When the emperor asked him what he had lost here, he answered in [[Swabian German]]: \"Don't frighten, high lords, I just want to peek how many cannons and other war things you've got, since I am the spy of Aalen\". The emperor laughed upon such a blatancy and ''acted'' na\u00efvety, steered him all through the camp and then sent him back home. Soon the emperor withdrew with his army as he thought a town such ''wise guys'' reside in deserved being spared.<ref>{{harvnb|Meier|2013|p=368}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==== Old Town Hall ====\nThe earliest record of the Old Town Hall was in 1575. Its outside wall features the oldest known coat of arms, which is of 1664. Until 1851, the building also housed the ''Krone-Post'' hotel, which coincided with being a station of the [[Thurn-und-Taxis-Post|Thurn und Taxis postal company]]. It has housed many notable persons. Thus the so-called \"Napoleon Window\" with its \"N\" painted on reminds of the stay of French emperor [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] in 1805. According to legend, he rammed his head so hard it bled on this window, when he was startled by the noise of his soldiers ridiculing the \"Spy of Aalen\".<ref name=\"bauer145\"/> The building was used as Aalen's town hall from 1907 until 1975. Today it houses a cabaret caf\u00e9 and the stage of the Theatre of the Town of Aalen. The town has adopted the ''Wischau Linguistic Enclave Society'' due to their godparenthood and stores their traditional costumes in the building.\n\n==== B\u00fcrgerspital ====\nThe ''B\u00fcrgerspital'' (\"Civic Asylum\") is a [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] house erected on ''Spritzenhausplatz'' (\"Fire Engine House Square\") in 1702. Until 1873, it was used as civic hospital, then, later as a retirement home. After a comprehensive renovation in 1980 it was turned into a senior citizen's community centre.<ref name=\"Citybummel\"/>\n\n==== Limes-Thermen ====\nOn a slope of the ''Langert'' mountain, south of the town, the ''Limes-Thermen'' (\"Limes [[Thermae]]\") [[hot spring]]s are located. They were built in ancient Roman style and opened in 1985. The health spa is supplied with water about {{convert|34|to|36|C|F}}.\n\n==== Market square ====\nThe market square is the historic hub of Aalen and runs along about {{convert|150|m|ft}} from the town hall in the south to the Historic Town Hall and the Old Town Hall in the north, where it empties into ''Radgasse'' alley. Since 1809, it is site of the weekly market on Wednesday and Saturday. About {{convert|10|m|ft}} in front of the ''Reichsst\u00e4dter Brunnen'' fountain at the town hall, the coats of arms of Aalen, its twinned cities and of the Wischau linguistic enclave are paved into the street as mosaic.\n\n===== Market fountain =====\n[[File:Marktbrunnen Aalen.jpg|thumb|Statue depicting [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph&nbsp;I]] at the market fountain]]\nIn 1705, for the water supply of Aalen a well casing was erected at the northern point of the market square, in front of the Historic Town Hall. It was a present of duke [[Eberhard Louis, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Eberhard Louis]]. The fountain bore a statue of emperor [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph&nbsp;I.]], who was enthroned in 1705 and in 1707 renewed Aalen's Imperial City privileges.<ref name=\"bauer82\"/> The fountain was supplied via a wooden pipe. Excessive water was dissipated through ditches branched from Kocher river. When in the early 1870s Aalen's water network was constructed, the fountain was replaced by a smaller fountain about {{convert|100|m|ft}} distant. In 1975, the old market fountain was re-erected in baroque style. It bears a replica of the emperor's statue, with the original statue exhibited in the new town hall's lobby. The [[cast iron]] casing plates depict the 1718 coat of arms of the Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg and the coats of arms of Aalen and of the merged municipalities.\n\n===== Reichsst\u00e4dter Brunnen =====\nThe ''Reichsst\u00e4dter Brunnen'' fountain (\"Imperial Civic Fountain\") is located in front of the town hall at the southern point of the market square. It was created by sculptor [[Fritz Nuss]] in 1977 to commemorate Aalen's time as an Imperial City (1360\u20131803). On its circumference is a [[frieze]] showing bronze figurines illustrating the town's history.<ref name=\"Citybummel\"/>\n\n==== Radgasse ====\nThe ''Radgasse'' (\"Wheel Alley\") features Aalen's oldest fa\u00e7ade. Originally a small pond was on its side. The buildings were erected between 1659 and 1662 for peasants with citizenry privileges and renovated in the mid-1980s. The namesake for the alley was the \"Wheel\" tavern, which was to be found at the site of today's address ''Radgasse 15''.<ref name=\"Citybummel\"/>\n\n==== Tiefer Stollen ====\n[[File:Eingang Besucherbergwerk Tiefer Stollen heute.JPG|thumb|''Tiefer Stollen'' tourist mine]]\nThe former iron ore pit ''Wilhelm'' at Braunenberg hill was converted into the ''Tiefer Stollen'' tourist mine in order to remind of the old-day miners' efforts and to maintain it as a memorial of early industrialisation in the Aalen area. It has a mining museum open for visitors, and a [[mine railway]] takes visitors deep into the mountain. The Town of Aalen, a sponsorship association, and many citizens volunteered several thousand hours of labour to put the mine into its current state. As far as possible, things were left in the original state. In 1989, a sanitary gallery was established where respiratory diseases are treated within rest cures.{{clarify|date=April 2013}} Thus the Aalen village of R\u00f6thard, where the gallery is located, was awarded the title of \"Place with sanitary gallery service\" in 2004.<ref>{{harvnb|Pfeifle|2004}}</ref>\n\n==== Observatory ====\nThe Aalen Observatory was built in 1969 as school observatory for the Schubart [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]. In 2001, it was converted to a public observatory. Since then, it has been managed by the ''Astronomische Arbeitsgemeinschaft Aalen'' (\"Aalen Astronomical Society\"). It is located on Schillerh\u00f6he hill and features two [[refractive telescope]]s. They were manufactured by [[Carl Zeiss AG]] which has its headquarters in nearby Oberkochen and operates a manufacturing works in Aalen ([[#Economy and infrastructure|see below]]). In the observatory, guided tours and lectures are held regularly.\n\n==== Windpark Waldhausen ====\n[[File:Windrad Waldhausen 02.JPG|thumb|Wind turbine at Windpark Waldhausen]]\nThe ''Windpark Waldhausen'' [[wind farm]] began operations in early 2007. It consists of seven [[REpower]] MM92 wind turbines with a [[nameplate capacity]] of 2 MW each.<ref name=\"windpark_waldhausen\">{{harvnb|Windpark Waldhausen|2013}}</ref> The hub height of each wind turbine is {{convert|100|m|ft}}, with a rotor diameter of {{convert|92|m|ft}}.\n\n==== Aalb\u00e4umle observation tower ====\n[[File:Aalb\u00e4umle.jpg|thumb|upright|''Aalb\u00e4umle'' observation tower]]\nThe {{convert|26|m|ft}} tall ''Aalb\u00e4umle'' observation tower is built atop ''Langert'' mountain.

It is the seat of the [[Ostalbkreis]] district and is its largest town. It is also the largest town in the [[Ostw\u00fcrttemberg]] region. Since 1956, Aalen has had the status of [[Gro\u00dfe Kreisstadt]] (major district town). It is noted for its many [[half-timbered]] houses constructed from the 16th century through the 18th century.<ref name=munro/>\n\nWith an area of 146.63&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, Aalen is ranked 7th in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and 2nd within the [[Stuttgart (region)|Government Region of Stuttgart]], after Stuttgart. With a population of about 66,000, Aalen is the 15th most-populated settlement in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg.\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n== Geography ==\n=== Situation ===\n[[File:Aalen Luftbild.JPG|thumb|left|Aerial view of the district of Unterkochen (the town centre is partly covered and in the background), the Aalen lowlands well perceptible in the back]]\nAalen is situated on the upper reaches of the river [[Kocher]], at the foot of the [[Swabian Jura]] which lies to the south and south-east, and close to the hilly landscapes of the [[Ellwangen Hills]] to the north and the ''Welland'' to the north-west.\n\nThe west of Aalen's territory is on the foreland of the eastern Swabian Jura, and the north and north-west is on the [[Swabian-Franconian Forest]], both being part of the [[Swabian Keuper-Lias Plains]]. The south-west is part of the [[Albuch]], the east is part of the [[H\u00e4rtsfeld]], these two both being parts of the Swabian Jura.<ref>{{harvnb|LUBW State Institute for Environment, Measurements, and Nature Conservation Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg|2010}}</ref>\n\nThe Kocher enters the town's territory from [[Oberkochen]] to the south, crosses the district of Unterkochen, then enters the town centre, where the ''Aal'' flows into it. The ''Aal'' is a small river located only within the town's territory. Next, the Kocher crosses the district of Wasseralfingen, then leaves the town for [[H\u00fcttlingen, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg|H\u00fcttlingen]]. Rivers originating near Aalen are the [[Rems (river)|Rems]] (near [[Essingen]], west of Aalen) and the [[Jagst]] (near [[Unterschneidheim]], east of Aalen), both being tributaries of the [[Neckar]], just like the Kocher.\n\nThe elevation in the centre of the market square is {{convert|430|m|ft}} relative to [[Normalh\u00f6hennull]]. The territory's lowest point is at the [[Lein (Kocher)|Lein]] river near Rodamsd\u00f6rfle, the highest point is the Gr\u00fcnberg's peak near Unterkochen at {{convert|733|m|ft}}.<ref name=\"bauer9\">{{harvnb|Bauer|1983|p=9}}</ref>\n\n=== Geology ===\nAalen's territory ranges over all [[Group (stratigraphy)|lithostratigraphic groups]] of the [[South German Jurassic]]: Aalen's south and the ''Flexner'' massif are on top of the [[White Jurassic]], the town centre is on the [[Brown Jurassic]], and a part of Wasseralfingen is on the [[Black Jurassic]]. As a result, the town advertises itself as a \"Geologist's Mecca\".<ref>{{harvnb|Sauerborn|2002}}</ref>\n\nMost parts of the territory are on the ''Opalinuston-Formation'' (Opalinum Clay [[Formation (stratigraphy)|Formation]]) of the [[Aalenian]] subdivision of the [[Jurassic]] Period, which is named after Aalen.<ref name=munro/> On the ''Sandberg'', the ''Schnaitberg'' and the ''Schradenberg'' hills, all in the west of Aalen, the ''Eisensandstein'' (Iron Sandstone) formation emerges to the surface. On the other hills of the city, [[sand]]s ''(Goldsh\u00f6fer Sande)'', [[gravel]] and residual [[rubble]] prevail.\nThe historic centre of Aalen and the other areas in the Kocher valley are founded completely on [[Holocene|holocenic]] [[floodplain]] [[loam]] ''(Auelehm)'' and riverbed gravel that have filled in the valley.\n\nMost parts of Dewangen and Fachsenfeld are founded on formations of ''Jurensismergel'' (Jurensis [[Marl]]), ''Posidonienschiefer'' (cf. [[Posidonia Shale]]), ''Amaltheenton'' (Amalthean Clay), ''Numismalismergel'' (Numismalis Marl) and ''Obtususton'' (Obtusus Clay, named after [[Asteroceras obtusum]] ammonites) moving from south to north, all belonging to the Jurassic and being rich in fossils. They are at last followed by the ''Trossingen Formation'' already belonging to the [[Late Triassic]].\n\nUntil 1939 iron ore was mined on the ''Braunenberg'' hill. (see [[#Tiefer Stollen|Tiefer Stollen]] section).\n\n=== Extent of the borough ===\nThe maximum extent of the town's territory amounts to {{convert|18|km|mi}} in a north\u2013south dimension and {{convert|25|km|mi}} in an east\u2013west dimension.

Tools made of [[flint]] and traces of [[Mesolithic]] human settlement dated between the 8th and 5th millennium BC were found on several sites on the margins of the Kocher and Jagst valleys. On the ''Schlo\u00dfbaufeld'' plateau (appr. {{convert|650|by|350|m|ft}}), situated behind ''Kocherburg'' castle near Unterkochen, a hill-top settlement was found, with the core being dated to the [[Bronze Age]]. In the ''Appenwang'' forest near Wasseralfingen, in Goldsh\u00f6fe, and in Ebnat, [[Tumulus|tumuli]] of the [[Hallstatt culture]] were found. In Aalen and Wasseralfingen, gold and silver coins left by the [[Celts]] were found. The Celts were responsible for the fortifications in the Schlo\u00dfbaufeld settlement consisting of sectional embankments and a stone wall. Also, Near Heisenberg (Wasseralfingen), a Celtic [[nemeton]] has been identified; however it is no longer readily apparent.<ref name=\"bauer25\">{{harvnb|Bauer|1983|p=25}}</ref>\n\n==== Roman era ====\n[[File:Limesmuseum Aalen principia.jpg|thumb|The Roman fort's excavated foundation walls]]\nAfter abandoning the [[Alb Limes]] (a ''[[Limes (Roman Empire)|limes]]'' generally following the ridgeline of the Swabian Jura) around 150 [[Anno Domini|AD]], Aalen's territory became part of the [[Roman Empire]], in direct vicinity of the then newly erected [[Rhaetian Limes]]. The Romans erected a [[castrum]] to house the [[cavalry]] unit ''[[Ala (Roman military)|Ala]] II Flavia milliaria''; its remains are known today as ''Kastell Aalen'' (\"Aalen Roman fort\"). The site is west of today's town centre at the bottom of the ''Schillerh\u00f6he'' hill. With about 1,000 horsemen and nearly as many [[groom (horse)|groom]]s, it was the greatest fort of [[auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliaries]] along the Rhaetian Limes. There were Civilian settlements adjacent along the south and the east. Around 260 AD, the Romans gave up the fort as they withdrew their presence in unoccupied [[Germania]] back to the [[Rhine]] and [[Danube]] rivers, and the [[Alamanni]] took over the region.<ref name=\"ostalbkreis_315\">{{harvnb|Winter|1992|pp=315\u2013320}}</ref><ref name=\"aalen-antike\">{{harvnb|City of Aalen|2013k}}</ref> Based on 3rd- and 4th-century coins found, the civilian settlement continued to exist for the time being. However, there is no evidence of continued civilization between the Roman era and the [[Middle Ages]].<ref name=\"bauer25\"/>\n\n==== Foundation ====\nBased on discovery of alamannic graves, archaeologists have established the 7th century as the origination of Aalen. In the northern and western walls of St. John's church, which is located directly adjacent to the eastern gate of the Roman fort, Roman stones were incorporated. The building that exists today probably dates to the 9th century.\n\nThe first mention of Aalen was in 839, when emperor [[Louis the Pious]] reportedly permitted the [[Fulda monastery]] to exchange land with the Hammerstadt village, then known as ''Hamarstat''.<ref name=\"ostalbkreis_123\">{{harvnb|Winter|1992|p=123}}</ref>\nAalen itself was first mentioned in an inventory list of [[Ellwangen Abbey]], dated ca. 1136, as the village ''Alon'', along with a lower nobleman named Conrad of Aalen. This nobleman probably had his ancestral castle at a site south of today's town centre and was subject first to Ellwangen abbey, later to the [[House of Hohenstaufen]], and eventually to the [[House of Oettingen]]. 1426 was the last time a member of that house was mentioned in connection with Aalen.\nDocuments, from the Middle Ages, indicate that the town of Aalen was founded by the Hohenstaufen some time between 1241 and 1246, but at a different location than the earlier village, which was supposedly destroyed in 1388 during the war between the Alliance of Swabian Cities and the Dukes of Bavaria.\nLater, it is documented that the counts of Oettingen ruled the town in 1340. They are reported to have pawned the town to Count [[Eberhard II, Count of W\u00fcrttemberg|Eberhard II]] and subsequently to the [[House of W\u00fcrttemberg]] in 1358 or 1359 in exchange for an amount of money.<ref name=\"bauer82\">{{harvnb|Bauer|1983|p=82}}</ref>\n\n==== Imperial City ====\n{{Infobox country\n|native_name = ''Reichsstadt Aalen''\n|conventional_long_name = Imperial City of Aalen\n|common_name = Aalen\n|era = Early modern period\n|status = [[Imperial State|Imperial Estate]]\n|empire = Holy Roman Empire\n|government_type = Republic\n|year_start = 1360\n|year_end = 1803\n|event_pre = Town founded\n|date_pre = 13th century\n|event_start = Gained [[Imperial immediacy]]\n|date_start =\n|event1 = [[Protestant Reformation]]\n|date_event1 = 1575\n|event2 = [[Counter-Reformation]]\n|date_event2 = 1628\u201332\n|event3 = Devastated by fire\n|date_event3 = 1634\n|event_end = [[German Mediatisation|Mediatised]] to [[Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg|W\u00fcrttemberg]]\n|date_end =\n|p1 = County of Oettingen\n|flag_p1 = 0193 Oettingen evetezett alapon pajzs \u00e9s har\u00e1ntkereszt.svg\n|border_p1 = no\n|p2 = County of W\u00fcrttemberg\n|flag_p2 = Wuerttemberg Arms.svg\n|border_p2 = no\n|s1 = Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg\n|flag_s1 = Wappen Herzogtum W\u00fcrttemberg.svg\n|border_s1 = no\n|capital = Aalen\n|footnotes = Before 1360, the town belonged to the [[County of Oettingen|Counts of Oettingen]] who pawned them into the [[County of W\u00fcrttemberg]] in 1358 or 1359.\n}}\n\n===== Designation as Imperial City =====\nDuring the war against W\u00fcrttemberg, Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] took the town without a fight after a siege. On 3 December 1360, he declared Aalen an [[Free imperial city|Imperial City]], that is, a city or town responsible only to the emperor, a status that made it a quasi-sovereign city-state and that it kept until 1803.<ref>{{harvnb|Canby|1984|p=1}}</ref> In 1377, Aalen joined the Alliance of Swabian Cities, and in 1385, the term ''civitas'' appears in the town's seal for the first time. In 1398, Aalen was granted the right to hold markets, and in 1401 Aalen obtained proper jurisdiction.\n\n[[File:Aalen 1528.jpg|thumb|Town view of 1528]]\nThe oldest artistic representation of Aalen was made in 1528. It was made as the basis of a lawsuit between the town and the Counts of Oettingen at the [[Reichskammergericht]] in Speyer. It shows Aalen surrounded by walls, towers, and double moats. The layout of the moats, which had an embankment built between them, is recognizable by the present streets named ''N\u00f6rdlicher, \u00d6stlicher, S\u00fcdlicher'' and ''Westlicher Stadtgraben'' (Northern, Eastern, Southern and Western Moat respectively). The wall was about {{convert|6|m|ft}} tall, 1518 [[Pace (unit)|single paces]] ({{convert|990|m|ft}}) long and enclosed an area of {{convert|5.3|ha|acre}}. During its early years, the town had two [[town gate]]s: The ''Upper'' or ''[[Ellwangen]] Gate'' in the east, and St. Martin's gate in the south; however due to frequent floods, St. Martin's gate was bricked up in the 14th century and replaced by the ''Lower'' or ''[[Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd|Gm\u00fcnd]] Gate'' built in the west before 1400. Later, several minor side gates were added. The central street market took place on the ''Wettegasse'' (today called ''Marktplatz'', \"market square\") and the ''Reichsst\u00e4dter Stra\u00dfe''. So the market district stretched from one gate to the other, however in Aalen it was not straight, but with a 90-degree curve between southern (St. Martin's) gate and eastern (Ellwangen) gate.\n\nAround 1500, the civic graveyard was relocated from the town church to St. John's Church,<ref name=\"bauer82\"/> and in 1514, the ''Vierundzwanziger'' (\"Group of 24\") was the first assembly constituted by the citizens.\n\n===== Reformation =====\nDelegated by W\u00fcrttemberg's Duke [[Louis III, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Louis III]], on 28 June 1575, nearly 30 years after [[Martin Luther]]'s death, [[Jakob Andreae]], professor and chancellor of the [[University of T\u00fcbingen]], arrived in Aalen. The sermon he gave the following day convinced the mayor, the council, and the citizens to adopt the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in the town. Andreae stayed in Aalen for four weeks to help with the change.<ref name=\"bauer82\"/> This brought along enormous changes, as the council forbade the Roman Catholic priests to celebrate masses and give sermons. However, after victories of the imperial armies at the beginning of the [[Thirty Years' War]], the [[Prince-Provost]]ry of Ellwangen, which still held the [[Jus patronatus|right of patronage]] in Aalen, were able to temporarily bring Catholicism back to Aalen; however after the military successes of the [[Protestant Union]], Protestant church practices were instituted again.\n\n===== Fire of 1634 =====\nOn the night of 5 September 1634,<ref name = GA>{{harvnb|Geschichtsverein Aalen (Historical Society of Aalen)|2013}}</ref> two ensigns of the army of [[Bernard of Saxe-Weimar]] who were fighting with the Swedes and retreating after the [[Battle of N\u00f6rdlingen (1634)|Battle of N\u00f6rdlingen]] set fire to two powder carriages, to prevent the war material to fall into Croatian hands and to prevent their advance. The result was a conflagration, that some say destroyed portions of the town. There are differing stories regarding this fire. According to 17th-century accounts, the church and all the buildings, except of the ''Schw\u00f6rturm'' tower, were casualties of the fire, and only nine families survived. 19th century research by Hermann Bauer, Lutheran pastor and local historian, discovered that the 17th-century account is exaggerated, but he does agree that the town church and buildings in a \"rather large\" semicircle around it were destroyed. The fire also destroyed the town archive housed in an addition to the church, with all of its documents.<ref name=\"bauer82\"/> After the fire, soldiers of both armies went through the town looting.<ref>{{harvnb|Anon|2013a}}</ref> It took nearly 100 years for the town to reach its population of 2,000.\n\n[[File:Free Imperial City of Aalen.JPG|thumb|Territory of the Imperial City of Aalen]]\n\nFrench troops marched through Aalen in 1688 during the [[Nine Years' War]]; however, unlike other places, they left without leaving severe damages. The French came through again in 1702 during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] and in 1741 during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]],<ref name=\"bauer82\"/> the latter also caused imperial troops to move through in 1743.<ref>{{harvnb|Bauer|2012|p=135}}</ref>\n\nThe town church's tower collapsed in 1765, presumably because proper building techniques were not utilized during the reconstruction after the fire of 1634. The collapsing tower struck two children of the tower watchman who died of their injuries, and destroyed the nave, leaving only the altar cross intact. The remaining walls had to be knocked down due to the damage. Reconstruction began the same year, creating the building that exists today.<ref name=\"bauer82\"/>\n\nOn 22 November 1749, the so-called ''Aalen protocol'' regulating the cohabitation of Lutherans and Roman Catholics in the jointly ruled territory of Oberkochen was signed in Aalen by the Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg and the Prince-Provostry of Ellwangen. Aalen had been chosen because of its neutral status as a Free Imperial City.\n\n===== Napoleonic era and end of the Imperial City of Aalen =====\n[[File:Angriff auf Aalen 1796.jpg|thumb|French attack on Aalen of 1796]]\nDuring the [[War of the First Coalition]] (1796), Aalen was looted.<ref name=\"bauer82\"/> The War of the Second Coalition concluded in 1801 with the signing of the [[Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville]], which led to the [[German Mediatisation]] of 1803 that assigned most Imperial Cities to the neighbouring principalities. Aalen was assigned to the [[Prince-elector|electorate]] of W\u00fcrttemberg, which later became the Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg, and became seat of the District (\"Oberamt\") of Aalen. During the [[War of the Third Coalition]], on 6 October 1805, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] arrived in Aalen, with an army of 40,000. This event, along with Bavarian and Austrian troops moving in some days later, caused miseries that according to the town clerk \"no feather could describe\".<ref name=\"bauer145\">{{harvnb|Bauer|1983|p=145}}</ref>\n\nIn 1811, the municipality of Unterrombach was formed out of some villages previously belonging to Aalen, some to the Barons of W\u00f6llwarth, and the eastern villages were assigned to the municipality of Unterkochen.\n\nIn the age of the Napoleonic wars, the [[town wall]]s were no longer of use, and in the 18th century, with the maintenance of walls, gates and towers becoming more neglected Finally, due to the fact that the funds were lacking, starting in 1800, most towers were demolished, the other buildings followed soon.<ref name=\"bauer145\"/>\n\n==== Industrial revolution ====\n[[File:Aalen nach 1861.jpg|thumb|Railway station and town after 1861]]\nBefore the [[industrial revolution]], Aalen's economy was shaped by its rural setting. Many citizens were pursuing farming besides their craft, such as [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]]. In the mid 19th century, there were twelve tanneries in Aalen, due to the proximity of [[Ulm]], an important sales market. Other crafts that added to the economy were [[Weaving|weaving mills]], which produced linen and woolen goods, and baking of sweet pastry and gingerbread.<ref name=\"bauer122\">{{harvnb|Bauer|1983|p=122}}</ref><ref name=\"eb1911\">{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911|p=2}}</ref>\n\nIn Aalen, industrialisation was a slow process. The first major increase was in the 1840s, when three factories for [[Nail (fastener)|nails]] and some other factories emerged.<ref name=\"bauer122\"/> It was the link with the railway network, by the opening of the [[Rems Railway]] from [[Cannstatt]] to Wasseralfingen in 1861, that brought more industry to Aalen, along with the royal [[steel mill]] (later ''Schw\u00e4bische H\u00fcttenwerke'') in Wasseralfingen. The Rems Railway's extension to N\u00f6rdlingen in 1863, the opening of the [[Brenz Railway]] in 1864 and of the [[Upper Jagst Railway]] in 1866 turned Aalen into a [[railway hub]]. Furthermore, between 1901 and its shutdown in 1972, the [[H\u00e4rtsfeld Railway]] connected Aalen with [[Dillingen an der Donau]] via [[Neresheim]]. Part of becoming a rail hub entailed more jobs based on the rail industry. These included, a maintenance facility, a [[Railway roundhouse|roundhouse]], an administrative office, two track maintenance shops, and a freight station with an industrial [[branch line]]. This helped shape Aalen into what today's historians call a \"railwayman's town\".<ref name=\"Hafner Stadtf\u00fchrer\">{{harvnb|Hafner|1989|p=5}}</ref> Starting in 1866, the utilities in town all began to be upgraded. Starting with the Aalen [[gasworks]] which were opened and [[gas lighting]] was introduced. Then in 1870, a modern [[water supply]] system was started and in 1912 the [[mains electricity]]. Finally, in 1935, the first electrically powered [[street light]]s were installed.<ref name=\"bauer122\"/>\n\n[[File:Aalen-um-1900.jpg|thumb|left|Aalen by 1900]]\nTo fight housing shortage during and immediately after [[World War I]], the town set up barracks settlement areas at the ''Schlauch'' and ''Alter Turnplatz'' grounds. In spite of the industry being crippled by the [[Great Depression]] of 1929, the public baths at the Hirschbach creek where modernized, extended and re-opened in 1931.<ref name=\"Hafner Stadtf\u00fchrer\" />\n\n==== Nazi era ====\nIn the [[German federal election, November 1932|federal election of 1932]], the [[Nazi Party]] performed below average in Aalen with 25.8% of votes compared to 33.1% on the national level, thus finishing second to the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]] which had 26.6% (11.9% nationwide) of the votes, and ahead of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] with 19.8% (20.4%). However, the [[German federal election, March 1933|March 1933 federal elections]] showed that the sentiment had changed as the Nazi Party received 34.1% (still below German average 43.9% nationwide), but by far the leading vote-getter in Aalen, followed by the Centre party at 26.6% (11.3% nationwide) and the Social Democrats 18.6% (18.3% nationwide).<ref>{{harvnb|Bauer|1984|p=273}}</ref>\n\nThe democratically elected mayor Friedrich Schwarz remained in office until the Nazis removed him from office, in 1934, and replaced him by chairman of the Nazi Party town council head and brewery owner Karl Barth. Karl Barth was a provisional mayor until the more permanent solution of Karl Sch\u00fcbel. In August 1934, the Nazi consumer fair [[Braune Messe]] (\"brown fair\") was held in Aalen.<ref name=\"Braune Messe\">{{harvnb|Anon|1934}}</ref>\n\nDuring [[Nazi Germany|Nazi rule in Germany]], there were many military offices constructed in Aalen, starting with, in 1936, a [[military district (Germany)|military district]] riding and driving school. The Nazis also built an army replenishment office ''(Heeresverpflegungsamt)'', a branch arsenal office ''(Heeresnebenzeugamt)'' and a branch army ammunitions institute ''(Heeresnebenmunitionsanstalt)''.\n\nStarting in 1935, [[Merger (politics)|mergers]] of neighbouring towns began. In 1938, the Oberamt was transformed into the [[Districts of Germany|Landkreis]] of Aalen and the municipality of Unterrombach was disbanded. Its territory was mostly added to Aalen, with the exception of Hammerstadt, which was added to the municipality of Dewangen. Forst, Rauental and Vogelsang were added to Essingen (in 1952 the entire former municipality of Unterrombach was merged into Aalen, with the exception of Forst, which is part of Essingen until present).\n\nIn September 1944, the ''Wiesendorf'' [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]], a [[List of subcamps of Natzweiler-Struthof|subcamp]] of [[Natzweiler-Struthof]], was constructed nearby. It was designated for between 200 and 300 prisoners who were utilized for [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labor in industrial businesses]] nearby. Until the camp's dissolution in February 1945, 60 prisoners died.<ref name=\"Sch\u00e4tzle\">{{harvnb|Sch\u00e4tzle|1980|p=66}}</ref> Between 1946 and 1957, the camp buildings were torn down; however, its foundations are still in place in house ''Moltkestra\u00dfe 44/46''. Also, there were several other labour camps which existed where prisoners of war along with women and men from occupied countries occupied by Germany were pooled. The prisoners at these other camps had to work for the arms industry in major businesses like ''Schw\u00e4bische H\u00fcttenwerke'' and the ''Alfing Ke\u00dfler'' machine factory.<ref name=\"gedenkstaetten\">{{harvnb|Puvogel|Stankowski|Graf|1995|p=20}}</ref>\n\nIn the civic hospital, the [[deaconess]]es on duty were gradually replaced by [[National Socialist People's Welfare]] nurses. [[Nazi eugenics]] led to [[compulsory sterilization]] of some 200 persons there.<ref name=\"Einhorn 140\">{{harvnb|Nu\u00dfbaumer|2008|p=297}}</ref>\n\nFortunately, Aalen avoided most of the combat activity during [[World War II]]. It was only during the last weeks of the war that Aalen became a target of [[Air warfare of World War II|air warfare]], which led to the destruction and severe damage of parts of the town, the train station, and other railway installations. A series of air attacks lasting for more than three weeks reached its peak on 17 April 1945, when [[United States Army Air Forces]] planes bombed the branch arsenal office and the train station. During this raid, 59 people were killed, more than half of them buried by debris, and more than 500 lost their homes.<ref name=\"Aalen Luftangriffe\">{{harvnb|City of Aalen|2013l}}</ref> Also, 33&nbsp;residential buildings, 12&nbsp;other buildings and 2&nbsp;bridges were destroyed, and 163&nbsp;buildings, including 2&nbsp;churches, were damaged.<ref name=\"bauer145\"/> Five days later, the Nazi rulers of Aalen were unseated by the US forces.\n\n==== Post-war era ====\nAalen became part of the State of [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], upon its creation in 1952. Then, with the Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg territorial reform of 1973, the District of Aalen was merged into the [[Ostalbkreis]] district. Subsequently, Aalen became seat of that district, and in 1975, the town's borough attained its present size ([[#Mergings|see below]]).\n\nThe population of Aalen exceeded the limit of 20,000, which was the requirement for to gain the status of [[Gro\u00dfe Kreisstadt]] (\"major district town\") in 1946. On 1 August 1947, Aalen was declared ''Unmittelbare Kreisstadt'' (\"immediate district town\"), and with the creation of the [[Gemeindeordnung]] (municipal code) of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg on 1 April 1956, it was declared ''Gro\u00dfe Kreisstadt''.\n\n=== Religions ===\nOn 31 December 2008, 51.1&nbsp;percent of Aalen were members of the [[Catholic Church]], 23.9&nbsp;percent were members of the [[Evangelical-Lutheran Church in W\u00fcrttemberg|Evangelical-Lutheran Church]]. About 25&nbsp;percent belong to other or no religious community or gave no information.<ref>{{harvnb|City of Aalen|2010}}</ref> The district of Waldhausen was the district with the highest percentage of Roman Catholic inhabitants at 75.6&nbsp;percent, and the central district was the one with the highest percentage of Evangelical-Lutheran inhabitants at 25.6&nbsp;percent, as well as those claiming no religious preference at 32.5&nbsp;percent.<ref name=\"stat. Jahrbuch\"/>\n\n==== Protestantism ====\nAalen's population originally was subject to the [[jus patronatus]] of Ellwangen Abbey, and thus subject to the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Augsburg]].\n\nWith the assistance of the Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg, in 1575, the [[reformation]] was implemented in Aalen. Subsequently, Aalen has been a predominantly Protestant town for centuries, with the exception of the years from 1628 until 1632 (see [[#Reformation|reformation]] section). Being an Imperial City, Aalen could govern its clerical matters on its own, so Clerics, organists and choir masters were direct subjects to the council, which thus exerted bishop-like power. There was even a proper hymn book for Aalen.<ref name=\"bauer82\"/> After the transition to W\u00fcrttemberg, in 1803, Aalen became seat of a [[deanery]], with the dean church being the Town Church (with the building constructed from 1765 to 1767 and existing until present). Another popular church is [[John the Baptist|St. John's]] Church, located on the cemetery and refurbished in 1561.\n\nAs Aalen's population grew in the 20th century, more parishes were founded: [[Mark the Evangelist|St. Mark's]] parish with its church building of 1967 and [[Martin of Tours|St. Martin's]] parish with its church of 1974. In the borough of Unterrombach, Aalen had implemented the [[reformation]] as well, but the community remained a [[chapel of ease|chapel-of-ease]] of Aalen. A proper church, the Christ Church, was erected in 1912 and a proper parish was established in 1947. In Fachsenfeld, the ruling family of Woellwarth resp. of Leinroden implemented the reformation. A parish church was built in 1591, however with an influx of Catholics in the 18th century, a Catholic majority was established. The other districts of present-day Aalen remained mostly catholic after the reformation, however Wasseralfingen established a Lutheran parish in 1891 and a church, St. Magdalene's Church, in 1893. In Unterkochen, after World War II, a parish was established and a church was built in 1960. All four parishes belong to the deanery of Aalen within the [[Evangelical-Lutheran Church in W\u00fcrttemberg]]. Furthermore, in Aalen there are [[Pietism|Old Pietistic]] communities.\n\n==== Catholicism ====\n[[File:Salvatorkirche aalen.jpg|thumb|upright|Salvator's Church]]\nThe few Catholics of today's central district were covered by the parish of Unterkochen until the 19th century, a situation which continued for some years even after completion of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|St. Mary's]] Church in 1868, which was constructed by [[Georg Morlok]].<ref name=\"bauer145\"/> However, in 1872 Aalen got its proper parish again, and in 1913, a second Catholic church, Salvator's Church, was completed, and in 1969 the Holy Cross Church was also finished. In 1963, a second parish was set up, and in 1972 it got a new Church, the new St. Mary's Church, which has been erected in place of the old St. Mary's church, which had been torn down in 1968. Another church of the second parish was St. Augustine's Church, which was completed in 1970. Finally, in 1976 and 1988, St. Elizabeth's Church and St. Thomas' Church were completed. Furthermore, in 1963, the St. Michael pastoral care office was built.\n\nHofherrnweiler has its own Catholic church, [[Saint Boniface|St. Boniface's]], since 1904. The villages of Dewangen, Ebnat, Hofen, Waldhausen and Wasseralfingen had remained Catholic after reformation, so old parishes and churches persist there. The ''Assumption of Mary'' Church in Dewangen has an [[Gothic art|early Gothic]] tower and a newly built nave (1875). [[Immaculate Conception|Mary's Immaculate Conception]] Church in Ebnat was constructed in 1723; however the church was first mentioned in 1298.\n\n[[File:Marienwallfahrtskirche Unterkochen.jpg|thumb|upright|St. Mary, Unterkochen]]\nHofen's [[Saint George]]'s Church is a [[fortified church]], whose current nave was built between 1762 and 1775.<ref>{{harvnb|Simla|2005}}</ref> Alongside the church, the Late Gothic [[Odile of Alsace|St. Odile's]] Chapel is standing, whose entrance has the year 1462 engraved upon it. Foundations of prior buildings have been dated to the 11th and 13th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Simla|2005a}}</ref>\n\nSt. Mary's Church of Unterkochen was first mentioned in 1248, and has served the Catholics of Aalen for a long time. Waldhausen's parish church of [[Saint Nicholas|St. Nicholas]] was built between 1699 and 1716. Wasseralfingen at first was a [[chapel of ease]] for Hofen, but has since had its own chapel, [[Saint Stephen|St. Stephen]], built. It was presumably built in 1353 and remodeled in 1832. In 1834, a proper parish was established, which built a new St. Stephen's Church. This new building utilized the [[Romanesque Revival architecture]] style and was built between 1881 and 1883, and has since remained the parish's landmark. Also, Fachsenfeld received its own church, named [[Sacred Heart]] in 1895. All Catholic parishes within Aalen are today incorporated into four pastoral care units within the ''Ostalb'' Deanery of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Rottenburg-Stuttgart|Diocese of Rottenburg-Stuttgart]]; however these units also comprise some parishes outside of Aalen. Pastoral Care Unit two comprises the parishes of Essingen, Dewangen and Fachsenfeld, unit four comprises Hofen and Wasseralfingen, unit five comprises both parishes of Aalen's centre and Hofherrnweiler, unit five comprises Waldhausen, Ebnat, Oberkochen and Unterkochen.{{clarify|date=April 2013}}\n\n==== Other christian communities ====\nIn addition to the two major religions within Aalen, there are also [[free church]]es and other communities, including the [[United Methodist Church]], the [[Baptists]], the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] and the [[New Apostolic Church]].\n\n==== Other religions ====\nUntil the late 19th century, no [[Jew]]s were documented within Aalen. In 1886 there were four Jews were living in Aalen, a number that rose to ten in 1900, fell to seven in 1905, and remained so until 1925. Upon the Nazis' rise to power in 1933, seven Jews, including two children, lived in Aalen.<ref name=\"Juden 1984\">{{harvnb|Bauer|1984|pp=302\u2013344}}</ref> During the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, the vitrines of the three Jewish shops in the town were smashed and their proprietors imprisoned for several weeks. After their release, most Aalen Jews emigrated. The last Jews of Aalen, Fanny Kahn, was forcibly resettled to [[Oberdorf am Ipf]], which had a large Jewish community. Today, a street of Aalen is named after her. The Jew Max Pfeffer returned from Brussels to Aalen in 1948 to continue his shop, but emigrated to Italy in 1967.<ref name=\"Juden 1984\"/>\n\nIn Aalen, there is an Islamic [[Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs|Ditib]] community, which maintains the ''D.I.T.I.B. Mosque of Aalen (Central Mosque)'' located at Ulmer Stra\u00dfe.<ref name=\"Moscheesuche Ditib\">{{harvnb|Anon|2013b}}</ref> The mosque's construction started on 30 August 2008. The [[Mill\u00ee G\u00f6r\u00fc\u015f]] organisation maintains the [[Mehmed II|Fatih]] Mosque, as well at Ulmer Stra\u00dfe.<ref name=\"Moscheesuche IGMG\">{{harvnb|Anon|2013c}}</ref>\n\n==== Mergings ====\nThe present-day make up of Aalen was created on 21 June 1975 by the unification of the cities of Aalen and Wasseralfingen,<ref name=munro>{{harvnb|Munro|1995|p=1}}</ref> with the initial name of ''Aalen-Wasseralfingen''. This annexation made Aalen's territory one third larger than its prior size. On 1 July 1975, the name ''Aalen'' was revived. Prior to this merger, the town of Aalen had already annexed the following municipalities:\n* 1938: Unterrombach\n* 1 January 1970: Waldhausen\n* 1 July 1972: Ebnat\n* 1 January 1973: Dewangen, Fachsenfeld (including the village of Hangendenbach, which was transferred from Abtsgm\u00fcnd in 1954) and Unterkochen. The merging of Dewangen nearly doubled the territory of Aalen.\n\n=== Population\u2019s progression and structure ===\n[[File:Population development Aalen.png|thumb|upright=2|Progression of Aalen's population]]\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[early modern period]], Aalen was just a small town with a few hundred inhabitants. The population grew slowly due to numerous wars, famines and epidemics. It was the beginning of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the 19th century where Aalen's growth accelerated. Whereas in 1803, only 1,932 people inhabited the town, in 1905 it had already increased to 10,442. The number continued to rise and reached 15,890 in 1939.\n\nThe influx of refugees and [[Heimatvertriebene|ethnic Germans]] from Germany's former eastern territories after [[World War II]] pushed the population to 31,814 in 1961. The merger with Wasseralfingen on 21 June 1975 added 14,597 persons and resulted in a total population of 65,165 people. On 30 June 2005, the population, which was officially determined by the [[List of statistical offices in Germany|Statistical Office of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], was 67,125.\n\nThe following overview shows how the population figures of the borough were ascertained. Until 1823, the figures are mostly estimates, thereafter census results or official updates by the state statistical office. Starting in 1871, the figures were determined by non-uniform method of tabulation using extrapolation.\n\n{|\n| valign=\"top\" |\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year\n!

In the W\u00fcrttemberg era, the mayor's title was initially called ''B\u00fcrgermeister'', then from 1819 it was [[Schulthei\u00df]], and since 1947 it is ''Oberb\u00fcrgermeister''. The mayor is elected for a term of eight years, and he is chairman and a voting member of the council. He has one deputy with the official title of ''Erster B\u00fcrgermeister'' (\"first mayor\") and one with the official title of ''B\u00fcrgermeister'' (\"mayor\").\n[[File:Aalen Flag.svg|thumb|upright|Flag of Aalen]]\n'''Heads of town in Aalen since 1802'''\n* 1802\u2013{{0|0000}}: Theodor Betzler\n* 1812\u20131819: Ludwig H\u00f6lder\n* 1819\u20131829: Theodor Betzler\n* 1829:{{0|\u20130000}} Palm\n* 1829\u20131848: Philipp Ehmann\n* 1848\u20131873: Gustav Oesterlein\n* 1873\u20131900: Julius Bausch\n* 1900\u20131902: Paul Maier\n* 1903\u20131934: Friedrich Schwarz\n* 1935\u20131945: [[Karl Sch\u00fcbel]]\n* 1945\u20131950: [[Otto Balluff]]\n* 1950\u20131975: Karl Sch\u00fcbel\n* 1976\u20132005: [[Ulrich Pfeifle]] ([[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]])\n* 2005\u20132013: [[Martin Gerlach]] (independent)\n* 2013\u2013{{0|0000}}: [[Thilo Rentschler]] ([[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]])\n\n=== Coat of arms and flag ===\n[[File:Stadtwappen Aalen 1766.JPG|thumb|100px|left|Coat of arms of 1766 with eagle and eel]]\nAalen's [[coat of arms]] depicts a black eagle with a red tongue on golden background, having a red shield on its breast with a bent silver [[eel]] on it. Eagle and eel were first acknowledged as Aalen's heraldic animals in the seal of 1385, with the eagle representing the town's [[imperial immediacy]].<ref name=\"bauer9\"/> After the territorial reform, it was bestowed again by the [[Stuttgart (region)|Administrative District of Stuttgart]] on 16 November 1976.\n\nThe coat of arms' [[blazon]] reads: \u201cIn gold, the black imperial eagle, with a red breast shield applied to it, therein a bent silver eel\u201d ''(In Gold der schwarze Reichsadler, belegt mit einem roten Brustschild, darin ein gekr\u00fcmmter silberner Aal)''.\n\nAalen's flag is striped in red and white and contains the coat of arms.\n\nThe origin of the town's name is uncertain. [[Matth\u00e4us Merian]] (1593\u20131650) presumed the name to originate from its location at the Kocher river, where \"frequently eels are caught\", while ''Aal'' is German for \"eel\". Other explanations point to Aalen as the garrison of an [[Ala (Roman allied military unit)|ala]] during the Roman empire, respectively to an abridgement of the Roman name \"Aquileia\" as a potential name of the Roman fort, a name that nearby [[Heidenheim an der Brenz]] bore as well.

The church, in its present shape being built between 1765 and 1767, is the only major [[Rococo|Late Baroque]] building in Aalen and is the main church of the Evangelical-Lutheran parish of Aalen.\n\n''St. John's Church'' is located inside of St. John's cemetery in the western centre. The building presumably is from the 9th century and thus is one of W\u00fcrttemberg's oldest existing churches. The interior features [[fresco]]s from the early 13th century.\n\nFor other churches in Aalen, see the [[#Religions|Religions]] section.\n\n==== Historic Town Hall with \"Spy\" ====\n[[File:Spionturm Aalen.jpg|thumb|upright|\"Spy's Tower\"]]\nThe Historic Town Hall was originally built in the 14th century. After the fire of 1634, it was re-constructed in 1636. This building received a clock from Lauterburg,<ref name=\"bauer82\"/> and the Imperial City of [[Nuremberg]] donated a [[Carillon]]. It features a figurine of the \"Spy of Aalen\" and historically displayed other figurines, however the latter ones were lost by a fire in 1884. Since then, the Spy resides inside the reconstructed tower and has become a symbol of the town. The building was used as the town hall until 1907. Since 1977, the Geological-Paleontological Museum resides in the Historic Town Hall.<ref name=\"Citybummel\">{{harvnb|City of Aalen|2013r}}</ref>\n\nAccording to legend, the citizens of Aalen owe the \"Spy of Aalen\" ''(Spion von Aalen)'' their town having been spared from destruction by the emperor's army:\n\n<blockquote>The Imperial City of Aalen once was were in quarrel with the emperor, and his army was shortly before the gates to take the town. The people of Aalen got scared and thus dispatched their \u201cmost cunning\u201d one out into the enemy\u2019s camp to spy out the strength of their troops. Without any digression, he went straight into the middle of the enemy camp, which inescapably led to him being seized and presented to the emperor. When the emperor asked him what he had lost here, he answered in [[Swabian German]]: \"Don't frighten, high lords, I just want to peek how many cannons and other war things you've got, since I am the spy of Aalen\". The emperor laughed upon such a blatancy and ''acted'' na\u00efvety, steered him all through the camp and then sent him back home. Soon the emperor withdrew with his army as he thought a town such ''wise guys'' reside in deserved being spared.<ref>{{harvnb|Meier|2013|p=368}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==== Old Town Hall ====\nThe earliest record of the Old Town Hall was in 1575. Its outside wall features the oldest known coat of arms, which is of 1664. Until 1851, the building also housed the ''Krone-Post'' hotel, which coincided with being a station of the [[Thurn-und-Taxis-Post|Thurn und Taxis postal company]]. It has housed many notable persons. Thus the so-called \"Napoleon Window\" with its \"N\" painted on reminds of the stay of French emperor [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] in 1805. According to legend, he rammed his head so hard it bled on this window, when he was startled by the noise of his soldiers ridiculing the \"Spy of Aalen\".<ref name=\"bauer145\"/> The building was used as Aalen's town hall from 1907 until 1975. Today it houses a cabaret caf\u00e9 and the stage of the Theatre of the Town of Aalen. The town has adopted the ''Wischau Linguistic Enclave Society'' due to their godparenthood and stores their traditional costumes in the building.\n\n==== B\u00fcrgerspital ====\nThe ''B\u00fcrgerspital'' (\"Civic Asylum\") is a [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] house erected on ''Spritzenhausplatz'' (\"Fire Engine House Square\") in 1702. Until 1873, it was used as civic hospital, then, later as a retirement home. After a comprehensive renovation in 1980 it was turned into a senior citizen's community centre.<ref name=\"Citybummel\"/>\n\n==== Limes-Thermen ====\nOn a slope of the ''Langert'' mountain, south of the town, the ''Limes-Thermen'' (\"Limes [[Thermae]]\") [[hot spring]]s are located. They were built in ancient Roman style and opened in 1985. The health spa is supplied with water about {{convert|34|to|36|C|F}}.\n\n==== Market square ====\nThe market square is the historic hub of Aalen and runs along about {{convert|150|m|ft}} from the town hall in the south to the Historic Town Hall and the Old Town Hall in the north, where it empties into ''Radgasse'' alley. Since 1809, it is site of the weekly market on Wednesday and Saturday. About {{convert|10|m|ft}} in front of the ''Reichsst\u00e4dter Brunnen'' fountain at the town hall, the coats of arms of Aalen, its twinned cities and of the Wischau linguistic enclave are paved into the street as mosaic.\n\n===== Market fountain =====\n[[File:Marktbrunnen Aalen.jpg|thumb|Statue depicting [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph&nbsp;I]] at the market fountain]]\nIn 1705, for the water supply of Aalen a well casing was erected at the northern point of the market square, in front of the Historic Town Hall. It was a present of duke [[Eberhard Louis, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Eberhard Louis]]. The fountain bore a statue of emperor [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph&nbsp;I.]], who was enthroned in 1705 and in 1707 renewed Aalen's Imperial City privileges.<ref name=\"bauer82\"/> The fountain was supplied via a wooden pipe. Excessive water was dissipated through ditches branched from Kocher river. When in the early 1870s Aalen's water network was constructed, the fountain was replaced by a smaller fountain about {{convert|100|m|ft}} distant. In 1975, the old market fountain was re-erected in baroque style. It bears a replica of the emperor's statue, with the original statue exhibited in the new town hall's lobby. The [[cast iron]] casing plates depict the 1718 coat of arms of the Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg and the coats of arms of Aalen and of the merged municipalities.\n\n===== Reichsst\u00e4dter Brunnen =====\nThe ''Reichsst\u00e4dter Brunnen'' fountain (\"Imperial Civic Fountain\") is located in front of the town hall at the southern point of the market square. It was created by sculptor [[Fritz Nuss]] in 1977 to commemorate Aalen's time as an Imperial City (1360\u20131803). On its circumference is a [[frieze]] showing bronze figurines illustrating the town's history.<ref name=\"Citybummel\"/>\n\n==== Radgasse ====\nThe ''Radgasse'' (\"Wheel Alley\") features Aalen's oldest fa\u00e7ade. Originally a small pond was on its side. The buildings were erected between 1659 and 1662 for peasants with citizenry privileges and renovated in the mid-1980s. The namesake for the alley was the \"Wheel\" tavern, which was to be found at the site of today's address ''Radgasse 15''.<ref name=\"Citybummel\"/>\n\n==== Tiefer Stollen ====\n[[File:Eingang Besucherbergwerk Tiefer Stollen heute.JPG|thumb|''Tiefer Stollen'' tourist mine]]\nThe former iron ore pit ''Wilhelm'' at Braunenberg hill was converted into the ''Tiefer Stollen'' tourist mine in order to remind of the old-day miners' efforts and to maintain it as a memorial of early industrialisation in the Aalen area. It has a mining museum open for visitors, and a [[mine railway]] takes visitors deep into the mountain. The Town of Aalen, a sponsorship association, and many citizens volunteered several thousand hours of labour to put the mine into its current state. As far as possible, things were left in the original state. In 1989, a sanitary gallery was established where respiratory diseases are treated within rest cures.{{clarify|date=April 2013}} Thus the Aalen village of R\u00f6thard, where the gallery is located, was awarded the title of \"Place with sanitary gallery service\" in 2004.<ref>{{harvnb|Pfeifle|2004}}</ref>\n\n==== Observatory ====\nThe Aalen Observatory was built in 1969 as school observatory for the Schubart [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]].

Many of these young people had gone off to the war right after high school or during high school and wanted to have a true college experience complete with athletic teams. The first football team included center Louis F. Avino, who also came up with the team's Golden Eagles mascot. The team was led by Robert Boozer who went on to a long career as an educator and coach at Brockport, the athletic field at Special Olympic Stadium was named Bob Boozer Field in his honor in 2006. The original locker room was a cold room located under the stairwell in Heartwell Hall. Brockport made it to the NCAA DIII postseason for the first time in school history in 2000 and went four consecutive times under coach Salomone's lead.\nIn [[2002 NCAA Division III football season#Postseason|2002]], Brockport made it all the way to the NCAA quarterfinals before losing to John Carroll in overtime. After a 15 year drought, the Golden Eagles qualified for the [[2017 NCAA Division III football season#Postseason|2017 NCAA Playoffs]] following an undefeated regular season.

Many of these young people had gone off to the war right after high school or during high school and wanted to have a true college experience complete with athletic teams. The first football team included center Louis F. Avino, who also came up with the teams Golden Eagles mascot. The team was led by Robert Boozer who went on to a long career as an educator and coach at Brockport, the athletic field at Special Olympic Stadium was named Bob Boozer Field in his honor in 2006. The original locker room was a cold room located under the stairwell in Heartwell Hall. Brockport made it to the NCAA DIII postseason for the first time in school history in 2000 and went four consecutive times under coach Salomone's lead.\nIn [[2002 NCAA Division III football season#Postseason|2002]], Brockport made it all the way to the NCAA quarterfinals before losing to John Carroll in overtime. After a 15 year drought, the Golden Eagles qualified for the [[2017 NCAA Division III football season#Postseason|2017 NCAA Playoffs]] following an undefeated regular season. In 2018 the Golden Eagles would once again go undefeated in the regular season and qualify for the [[2018_NCAA_Division_III_football_season#Postseason|2018 NCAA Division III Playoffs]]. The 2019 Season the Golden Eagles would once again find their way to the [[2019 NCAA Division III football season]]  playoffs with a win against Western New England and advance to play Muhlenberg. \n\n'''History in the NCAA Division III Playoffs'''\n\n{| cellpadding=\"1\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n!bgcolor=\"#00573C\"| <span style=\"color:white;\">Year</span>\n!bgcolor=\"#00573C\"| <span style=\"color:white;\">NCAA Division</span>\n!bgcolor=\"#00573C\"| <span style=\"color:white;\">Coach</span>\n!bgcolor=\"#00573C\"| <span style=\"color:white;\">Record</span>\n!bgcolor=\"#00573C\"| <span style=\"color:white;\">NCAA Division III Playoffs</span>\n!bgcolor=\"#00573C\"| <span style=\"color:white;\">Opponent</span>\n!bgcolor=\"#00573C\"| <span style=\"color:white;\">PF</span>\n!bgcolor=\"#00573C\"| <span style=\"color:white;\">PA</span>\n!bgcolor=\"#00573C\"| <span style=\"color:white;\">Location</span>\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 2000 Brockport State Football || [[Division III (NCAA)|III]] || Rocco Salomone || 8-1 || [[2000 NCAA Division III football season|2000 Division III Playoffs 2nd Round]]  || Springfield || 6 || 13 || [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver Stadium]]\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 2001 Brockport State Football || [[Division III (NCAA)|III]] || Rocco Salomone || 9-2 || [[2001 NCAA Division III football season|2001 Division III Playoffs 1st Round]]  || Rowan || 17 || 40 || [[ Glassboro, New Jersey]]\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 2002 Brockport State Football || [[Division III (NCAA)|III]] || Rocco Salomone || 9-2 || [[2002 NCAA Division III football season|2002 Division III Playoffs 1st Round]]  || Springfield || 16 || 0 || [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver Stadium]]\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 2002 Brockport State Football || [[Division III (NCAA)|III]] || Rocco Salomone || 10-2 || [[2002 NCAA Division III football season|2002 Division III Playoffs 2nd Round]]  || Rowan || 15 || 12 || [[ Glassboro, New Jersey]]\n|- align=\"center\"Yockel, Joseph. \"The Birth of Brockport Football: The Robert Ellsworth Boozer Years\", The Spectrum: A Scholars Day Journal\nVolume 1 Article 11, 2012\n| 2002 Brockport State Football || [[Division III (NCAA)|III]] || Rocco Salomone || 10-3 || [[2002 NCAA Division III football season|2002 Division III Playoffs Quarterfinals]]  || John Carroll || 10 || 16 || [[Rochester, New York]]\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 2003 Brockport State Football || [[Division III (NCAA)|III]] || Rocco Salomone || 9-2 || [[2003 NCAA Division III football season|2003 Division III Playoffs 1st Round]]  || Ithaca || 9 || 14 || [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver Stadium]]\n|- align=\"center\"<ref>(https://digitalcommons.brockport.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1010&context=spectrum)</ref>\n| 2017 Brockport State Football || [[Division III (NCAA)|III]] || Jason Mangone || 11-0 || [[2017 NCAA Division III football season|2017 Division III Playoffs 1st Round]]  || Plymouth State || 66 || 0 || [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver Stadium]]\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 2017 Brockport State Football || [[Division III (NCAA)|III]] || Jason Mangone || 12-0 || [[2017 NCAA Division III football season|2017 Division III Playoffs 2nd Round]]  || Wesley || 49 || 28 || [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver Stadium]]\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 2017 Brockport State Football || [[Division III (NCAA)|III]] || Jason Mangone || 13-0 || [[2017 NCAA Division III football season|2017 Division III Playoffs Quarterfinals]]  || Delaware Valley || 31 || 28 || [[Doylestown, Pennsylvania]]\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 2017 Brockport State Football || [[Division III (NCAA)|III]] || Jason Mangone || 13-1 || [[2017 NCAA Division III football season|2017 Division III Playoffs Semifinals]]  || M.

It is known for its ornate [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature]] leaves and border decorations.\n\nSeveral artists were employed in the production. It was completed in two separate stages, each with a distinctive style. The earlier leaves were painted by artists influenced by [[Jean Pucelle]], the later by artists working in the vanguard of the [[International Gothic]] period of Gothic art. Because of this, the ''Petites Heures'' exemplifies the \"rupture in style\" that occurred in French illumination in the final two decades of the fourteenth century.<ref>[http://archivesetmanuscrits.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cc784809 Latin 18014] archivesetmanuscrits.bnf</ref>\n\nA high-resolution facsimile was published in 1988, with monographs by Avril, Dunlop and [[William Brunsdon Yapp|Yapp]].<ref>Husband, p. 45</ref>\n\n== History ==\nJean de Berry commissioned six books of hours between 1375 and 1416.
