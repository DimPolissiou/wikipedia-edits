It is based on the [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]] [[Courtney Whitmore|of the same name]] created by Johns and Lee Moder. The series follows Courtney Whitmore, portrayed by [[Brec Bassinger]], who discovers the cosmic staff and becomes the inspiration for a new generation of superheroes who become the [[Justice Society of America]].\n\nDC Universe ordered the series in July 2018. Bassinger was cast in September 2018, with additional castings for her family members, the Justice Society of America, and the [[Injustice Society]] through February 2019. Filming for the series began by March 2019 in the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]] in Georgia.\n\n''Stargirl'' is set to premiere on May 18, 2020.

The pilot is set to be written by [[Geoff Johns]] who will executive produce alongside [[Greg Berlanti]] and [[Sarah Schechter]]. Production companies involved with the series are Mad Ghost Productions, Berlanti Productions, and [[Warner Bros. Television]]. The series was said to be a \"reimagining\" of [[Courtney Whitmore|Stargirl]].<ref name=\"SeriesOrder\" />\n\n===Writing===\nJohns described ''Stargirl'' as having a similar tone to 1980s films such as ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' and ''[[Back to the Future]]''. The start of the series sees the deaths of the original members of the [[Justice Society of America]] (JSA). With the younger generation taking up their mantle, Johns said their \"paths aren't complete. They don't know where they're going to be or what they're going to be. And so, there's all sorts of mistakes they can make and choices they can make, and who knows what their ultimate destiny will be?... It makes for a lot of fun and a lot of unpredictability.\" The members of the [[Injustice Society]] mirrors those on the JSA team, with Johns teasing that just about everyone who has been a member of the Injustice Society in the comics would appear in the series. Speaking to classic JSA members such as [[Alan Scott]] and [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]], Johns called them the \"elderly statesmen\" and that they \"are spoken of and they exist in the JSA\" with \"their legacies... felt throughout the show\". There were also \"plans in the future for things\". For the first season, star [[Brec Bassinger]] felt the original [[Charles McNider|Doctor Mid-Nite, Charles McNider]] would have \"a significant role to play\", while Johns added the season would establish the [[Seven Soldiers of Victory]] and the first superhero team before the JSA and explore the history of the Cosmic Staff.<ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" />\n\n===Casting===\nIn September 2018, it was announced that [[Brec Bassinger]] had been cast as [[Courtney Whitmore|Courtney Whitmore / Stargirl]].<ref name=\"Bassinger\" /> Johns called the casting of Stargirl a difficult process, auditioning hundreds of actress for the role. On why Bassinger was perfect for the role, Johns said, \"Immediately... I knew she was Courtney. She has the humor, she has the enthusiasm, the energy, the innate optimism, and Brec really embodies who Stargirl is\".<ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" /> In November 2018, the following roles were cast: Anjelika Washington as [[Doctor Mid-Nite#Beth Chapel|Beth Chapel / Doctor Mid-Nite]],<ref name=\"Washington\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" /> [[Yvette Monreal]] as [[Wildcat (Yolanda Montez)|Yolanda Montez / Wildcat]], and Christopher James Baker as [[Brainwave (comics)|Henry King / Brainwave]].<ref name=\"MonrealBaker\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" /> The next month, [[Joy Osmanski]] was cast as [[Tigress (DC Comics)|Paula Brooks / Tigress]], [[Neil Hopkins]] was cast as [[Sportsmaster|Lawrence \u201cCrusher\u201d Crock / Sportsmaster]], and [[Nelson Lee]] was cast as [[Dragon King (DC Comics)|Dr. Ito / Dragon King]], members of the [[Injustice Society]].<ref name=\"InjusticeSociety\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" /> In January 2019, [[Luke Wilson]] was cast as [[Pat Dugan|Pat Dugan / S.T.R.I.P.E.]]<ref name=\"Wilson\" /> Cameron Gellman joined the cast as [[Hourman (Rick Tyler)|Rick Tyler / Hourman]] the next month,<ref name=\"Gellman\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" /> along with [[Amy Smart]] as Barbara Whitmore,<ref name=\"Final4Starring\" /> [[Neil Jackson]] as [[Icicle (comics)|Jordan Mahkent / Icicle]],<ref name=\"Final4Starring\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" /> Trae Romano as Mike Dugan, and Hunter Sansone in an undisclosed role rounding out the cast.<ref name=\"Final4Starring\" />\n\nIn December 2018, the following members of the [[Justice Society of America]] were cast, all recurring roles: [[Joel McHale]] as [[Sylvester Pemberton|Sylvester Pemberton / Starman]],<ref name=\"McHale\" /> [[Lou Ferrigno, Jr.]] as [[Hourman (Rex Tyler)|Rex Tyler / Hourman]],<ref name=\"Ferrigno\" /> Brian Stapf as [[Wildcat (Ted Grant)|Ted Grant / Wildcat]],<ref name=\"Stapf\" /> and [[Henry Thomas]] as [[Charles McNider|Charles McNider / Doctor Mid-Nite]].<ref name=\"Thomas\" /> In February 2019, Jake Austin Walker was cast in an undisclosed role and Meg Delacy was cast as Cindy Burman.<ref name=\"WalkerDeLacy\" /> In April 2019, Hina Khan was cast in an undisclosed role said to be a principal.<ref name=\"Khan\" />\n\n===Filming===\nFilming had began by March 14, 2019,<ref name=\"AtlantaFilmingStart\" /> with [[Glen Winter]] directing the pilot.<ref name=\"Winter\" /> Filming occurs throughout the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]], including: [[Marietta, Georgia|Marietta]], [[Virginia\u2013Highland]], [[Duluth, Georgia|Duluth]], [[Lithia Springs, Georgia|Lithia Springs]], [[Dallas, Georgia|Dallas]],<ref name=\"AtlantaFilmingStart\" /> [[Marietta Square]], [[West End, Atlanta|West End]], [[Westlake High School (Georgia)|Westlake High School]], the Atlanta Center for Medical Research,<ref name=\"AtlantaFilming2\" /> Campbell Middle School, [[Paulding County, Georgia|Paulding County]], [[Smyrna, Georgia|Smyrna]], [[Arbor Place]] Mall, [[Vinings, Georgia|Vinings]],<ref name=\"AtlantaFilming3\" /> [[Mableton, Georgia|Mableton]], and [[Douglas County High School (Douglasville, Georgia)|Douglas County High School]].<ref name=\"AtlantaFilming4\" />\n\n===Music===\nIn June 2019, [[Pinar Toprak]] revealed she would be composing for the series.<ref name=\"Toprak\" />\n\n==Release==\n''Stargirl'' is scheduled to begin airing on DC Universe on May 18, 2020.<ref name=\"NewRelease\" /> The series was originally intended to begin airing on May 11, 2020.<ref name=\"OriginalReleaseDate\" /> In November 2019, it was announced that [[The CW]] would broadcast each episode the day after it premieres on the streaming service, with each episode available to stream on The CW's online platforms after its broadcast.<ref name=\"The CW\" /> It will start airing on The CW on May 19, 2020, at 8 pm.<ref name=\"NewRelease\" />\n\n===Marketing===\nOn December 7, 2019, a teaser trailer was released.<ref name=\"FirstTrailer\" />\n\n==Arrowverse==\n{{Main|Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)}}\nStargirl and her team were briefly introduced in the [[Arrowverse]] crossover \"[[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|Crisis on Infinite Earths]]\" in January 2020.

In April 2020, Johns said, \"right now the main concern is making sure that this show is great, that these characters are great, that they have their own stories and they get the proper screen time and the proper episodes to develop on their own. So hopefully in the future we can do something fun, but the first season is all about making sure that ''Stargirl'' is the best show it can possibly be.\" Bassinger added that there had already been preliminary discussion about crossing over with ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', and she was hopeful to be able to crossover with [[Melissa Benoist]] on ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]''.<ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"SeriesOrder\">{{cite web |last1=Patten |first1=Dominic |title=Geoff Johns To Write & Produce \u2018Stargirl\u2019 Series For DC Universe \u2013 Comic-Con |url=https://deadline.com/2018/07/geoff-johns-stargirl-tv-series-dc-universe-greg-berlanti-wbtv-comic-con-1202429776/ |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |accessdate=July 19, 2018 |date=July 19, 2018}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"LegendsStargirl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/legends-tomorrow-legion-doom-season-913953|title=Comic-Con: ''Legends of Tomorrow'' to Tackle Legion of Doom Villain Team In Season 2|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|last=Bucksbaum|first=Sydney|date=July 23, 2016|accessdate=April 3, 2020}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Bassinger\">{{cite web |last1=Boucher |first1=Geoff |title=\u2018Stargirl\u2019 Discovered: Warner Bros Takes Shine To Brec Bassinger As DC Universe Superhero |url=https://deadline.com/2018/09/stargirl-brec-bassinger-dc-universe-series-1202468446/ |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |accessdate=September 20, 2018 |date=September 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Washington\">{{cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/dc/2018/11/02/stargirl-casts-anjelika-washington-in-undisclosed-dc-role/|title='Stargirl' Casts Anjelika Washington in Undisclosed DC Role|last=Burlingame|first=Russ|work=Comicbook.com|date=November 2, 2018|accessdate=November 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"MonrealBaker\">{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2018/11/stargirl-yvette-monreal-christopher-james-baker-set-as-regulars-in-dc-universe-series-1202510976/|title=\u2018Stargirl\u2019: Yvette Monreal & Christopher James Baker Set As Regulars In DC Universe Series|last=Petski|first=Denise|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=November 29, 2018|accessdate=November 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"McHale\">{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/joel-mchale-starman-dc-universe-stargirl-exclusive-1203087415/|title=Joel McHale Cast as Starman in DC Universe\u2019s \u2018Stargirl\u2019 (EXCLUSIVE)|last=Turchiano|first=Danielle|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=December 12, 2018|accessdate=January 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Ferrigno\">{{cite web|url=https://tvline.com/2018/12/13/stargirl-casts-hourman-lou-ferrigno-jr-dc-universe/|title=Stargirl Casts Lou Ferrigno Jr. as Hourman, Founding Member of JSA|last=Mitovitch|first=Matt Webb|work=[[TV Line]]|date=December 13, 2018|accessdate=January 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Stapf\">{{cite web|url=https://www.tvinsider.com/738208/dc-universe-stargirl-wildcat-brian-stapf/|title=DC Universe's 'Stargirl' Casts Brian Stapf as Wildcat|last=Holbrook|first=Damian|work=[[TV Insider]]|date=December 13, 2018|accessdate=January 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Thomas\">{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/tv/2018/12/17/stargirl-henry-thomas-mid-nite-dc-universe/|title=DC Universe's Stargirl casts Haunting of Hill House star as the JSA's Dr. Mid-Nite|last=Agard|first=Chancellor|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=December 17, 2018|accessdate=January 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"InjusticeSociety\">{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2018/12/stargirl-casting-meet-three-members-of-injustice-society-1202524168/|title=\u2018Stargirl\u2019 Casting: Meet Three Members Of Injustice Society|last=Boucher|first=Geoff|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=December 20, 2018|accessdate=January 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Wilson\">{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/01/stargirl-luke-wilson-dc-comics-geoff-johns-1202531355/|title=\u2018Stargirl\u2019: Luke Wilson Joins Cast Of DC Universe Series|last=Boucher|first=Geoff|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=January 8, 2019|accessdate=January 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Winter\">{{cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/dc/2019/01/10/arrow-veteran-glen-winter-to-direct-dc-universes-stargirl-pilot/|title='Arrow' Veteran Glen Winter To Direct DC Universe's 'Stargirl' Pilot|last=Burlingame|first=Russ|work=Comicbook.com|date=January 11, 2019|accessdate=April 3, 2020}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"WalkerDeLacy\">{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2019/02/stargirl-dc-universe-series-jake-austin-walker-and-meg-delacy-1202549066/|title='Stargirl': DC Universe Series Adds Jake Austin Walker and Meg DeLacy |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |first=Geoff |last=Boucher |date=February 4, 2019 |accessdate=April 2, 2020}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Gellman\">{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/02/stargirl-casts-cameron-gellman-carmela-zumbado-you-1202561735/|title=\u2018Stargirl\u2019 Casts Cameron Gellman;

It is based on the [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]] [[Courtney Whitmore|of the same name]] created by Johns and Lee Moder. The series follows Courtney Whitmore, portrayed by [[Brec Bassinger]], who discovers the cosmic staff and becomes the inspiration for a new generation of superheroes who become the [[Justice Society of America]].\n\nDC Universe ordered the series in July 2018. Bassinger was cast in September 2018, with additional castings for her family members, the Justice Society of America, and the [[Injustice Society]] through February 2019. Filming for the series began by March 2019 in the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]] in Georgia.\n\n''Stargirl'' is set to premiere on May 18, 2020. The series will also air the following day on [[The CW]], as well as be available on The CW's digital platforms. Ahead of the series premiere, characters from the series were featured in the [[Arrowverse]] crossover \"[[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|Crisis on Infinite Earths]]\", establishing ''Stargirl'' as existing on [[Earth-2 (Arrowverse post-Crisis)|a parallel earth to the Arrowverse series]].\n\n==Premise==\nHigh school sophomore [[Courtney Whitmore]] discovers a powerful cosmic staff, and after learning that her step-father [[Pat Dugan]] used to be a hero sidekick, becomes the inspiration for a new generation of superheroes.<ref name=\"Bassinger\" />\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Main===\n* [[Brec Bassinger]] as [[Courtney Whitmore|Courtney Whitmore / Stargirl]]:<br />A high school sophomore who discovers a powerful cosmic staff and becomes the hero Stargirl.<ref name=\"Bassinger\" /> She is the leader of the new [[Justice Society of America]].<ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" /> Bassinger did not look at the previous portrayals of the character by [[Britt Irvin]] on ''[[Smallville]]'' or [[Sarah Grey]] on ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'' because they were depicted as \"older, more mature version[s]\" of Stargirl. Bassinger added the series followed the comic ''[[Stars and S.T.R.I.P.E.]]'' more \"in that she's young, high school, naive, which I wanted to bring that into this version of Stargirl.\"<ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" />\n* Anjelika Washington as [[Doctor Mid-Nite#Beth Chapel|Beth Chapel / Doctor Mid-Nite]]: A member of the new Justice Society of America.<ref name=\"Washington\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" />\n* [[Yvette Monreal]] as [[Wildcat (Yolanda Montez)|Yolanda Montez / Wildcat]]: A member of the new Justice Society of America.<ref name=\"MonrealBaker\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" />\n* Christopher James Baker as [[Brainwave (comics)|Henry King / Brainwave]]: A member of the [[Injustice Society]].<ref name=\"MonrealBaker\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" />\n* [[Joy Osmanski]] as [[Tigress (DC Comics)|Paula Brooks / Tigress]]: A member of the Injustice Society who hunts the world's most dangerous humans.<ref name=\"InjusticeSociety\" />\n* [[Neil Hopkins]] as [[Sportsmaster|Lawrence \"Crusher\" Crock / Sportsmaster]]: A member of the Injustice Society who feels all of his targets are part of a game to win.<ref name=\"InjusticeSociety\" />\n* [[Nelson Lee]] as [[Dragon King (DC Comics)|Dr. Ito / Dragon King]]: A member of the Injustice Society and a controversial scientist who hides his face and experiments on himself and his patients.<ref name=\"InjusticeSociety\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" />\n* [[Luke Wilson]] as [[Pat Dugan|Pat Dugan / S.T.R.I.P.E.]]:<br />Courtney's stepfather, the former sidekick to Starman (when he was known as Stripesy), and a mechanic who pilots a 15-foot robot of his own creation.<ref name=\"Wilson\" /> He is a member of the new Justice Society of America.<ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" />\n* Cameron Gellman as [[Hourman (Rick Tyler)|Rick Tyler / Hourman]]: A member of the new Justice Society of America.<ref name=\"Gellman\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" />\n* [[Amy Smart]] as Barbara Whitmore: Courtney's mother and wife of Pat Dugan striving to balance her work and home life.<ref name=\"Final4Starring\" />\n* [[Neil Jackson]] as [[Icicle (comics)|Jordan Mahkent / Icicle]]: A member of the Injustice Society.<ref name=\"Final4Starring\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" />\n* Hunter Sansone<ref name=\"Final4Starring\" />\n* Trae Romano as Mike Dugan: Pat Dugan's son and Courtney's stepbrother.<ref name=\"Final4Starring\" />\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Joel McHale]] as [[Sylvester Pemberton|Sylvester Pemberton / Starman]]: A member of the original Justice Society of America who used an anti-gravity cosmic staff that Courtney finds.<ref name=\"McHale\" />\n* [[Lou Ferrigno, Jr.]] as [[Hourman (Rex Tyler)|Rex Tyler / Hourman]]: A member of the original Justice Society of America, who is \"a master chemist and adrenaline junkie\" with the ability to acquire super-strength for one hour a day.<ref name=\"Ferrigno\" />\n* Brian Stapf as [[Wildcat (Ted Grant)|Ted Grant / Wildcat]]: A member of the original Justice Society of America, who is a former heavyweight boxer.<ref name=\"Stapf\" />\n* [[Henry Thomas]] as [[Charles McNider|Charles McNider / Doctor Mid-Nite]]: A member of the original Justice Society of America, who is a detective and a brilliant and forward-thinking medical pioneer.<ref name=\"Thomas\" />\n\n===Guest===\n* Jake Austin Walker<ref name=\"WalkerDeLacy\" />\n* Meg DeLacy as Cindy Burman: The daughter of Dragon King and the most popular student at Blue Valley High who is determined to follow in her father's footsteps.<ref name=\"WalkerDeLacy\" />\n* Hina Khan as a principal<ref name=\"Khan\" />\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Episode table |background=#12223A |overall= |title= |director= |writer= |airdate= |prodcode= |released=y |episodes=\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 1\n| Title           = Pilot\n| RTitle          = <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BuuwJytAyi9/|title=IT.

The pilot is set to be written by [[Geoff Johns]] who will executive produce alongside [[Greg Berlanti]] and [[Sarah Schechter]]. Production companies involved with the series are Mad Ghost Productions, Berlanti Productions, and [[Warner Bros. Television]]. The series was said to be a \"reimagining\" of [[Courtney Whitmore|Stargirl]].<ref name=\"SeriesOrder\" />\n\n===Writing===\nJohns described ''Stargirl'' as having a similar tone to 1980s films such as ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' and ''[[Back to the Future]]''. The start of the series sees the deaths of the original members of the [[Justice Society of America]] (JSA). With the younger generation taking up their mantle, Johns said their \"paths aren't complete. They don't know where they're going to be or what they're going to be. And so, there's all sorts of mistakes they can make and choices they can make, and who knows what their ultimate destiny will be?... It makes for a lot of fun and a lot of unpredictability.\" The members of the [[Injustice Society]] mirrors those on the JSA team, with Johns teasing that just about everyone who has been a member of the Injustice Society in the comics would appear in the series. Speaking to classic JSA members such as [[Alan Scott]] and [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]], Johns called them the \"elderly statesmen\" and that they \"are spoken of and they exist in the JSA\" with \"their legacies... felt throughout the show\". There were also \"plans in the future for things\".

It is Cartoon Network's first animated series to be created solely by a woman. It is the [[coming-of-age story]] of a young boy, [[Steven Universe (character)|Steven Universe]] (voiced by [[Zach Callison]]), who lives with the Crystal Gems\u2014magical, humanoid aliens named [[Garnet (Steven Universe)|Garnet]] ([[Estelle (musician)|Estelle]]), [[Amethyst (Steven Universe)|Amethyst]] ([[Michaela Dietz]]), and [[Pearl (Steven Universe)|Pearl]] ([[Deedee Magno Hall]])\u2014in the fictional town of Beach City. Steven, who is half-Gem, has adventures with his friends and helps the Gems protect the world from their own kind. Its pilot was first shown on May 21, 2013, and the series premiered on November 4, 2013. Its fifth and final season concluded in January 2019. The TV film ''[[Steven Universe: The Movie]]'' was released on September 2, 2019, and an epilogue [[Limited series (television)|limited series]], ''[[Steven Universe Future]]'', premiered on December 7, 2019 and ended on March 27, 2020.\n\nThe themes of the series include love, family, and the importance of healthy interpersonal relationships. Sugar based the lead character on her younger brother Steven, who is an artist for the series. She developed ''Steven Universe'' while she was a writer and storyboard artist on ''[[Adventure Time]]'', which she left when Cartoon Network commissioned her series for full production. The series is storyboard-driven; when episodes are being produced the show's storyboard artists are responsible for writing the dialogue and creating the action. Books, comics and video games based on the series have been released. \n\nThe series has developed a broad fan base and has been critically acclaimed for its design, music, voice acting, characterization, prominence of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] themes and [[science fantasy]] worldbuilding. The series won its first [[GLAAD Media Award]] for Outstanding Kids & Family Program in [[30th GLAAD Media Awards|2019]], becoming the first animated series to win the award. It also received its first [[Peabody Award]] for Children's & Youth Programming in 2019. It has been nominated for five [[Primetime Emmy Award for Short-format Animation|Emmy Awards]] and five [[Annie Awards]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n''Steven Universe'' is set in the fictional town of Beach City, [[Delmarva]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sugar|first1=Rebecca|title=I am Rebecca Sugar, creator of Steven Universe, and former Adventure Time storyboarder, AMA!|date=August 20, 2014|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2e4gmx/i_am_rebecca_sugar_creator_of_steven_universe_and/cjw4mo6|website=[[Reddit]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151213200144/https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2e4gmx/i_am_rebecca_sugar_creator_of_steven_universe_and/cjw4mo6|archivedate=December 13, 2015|df=}}</ref> where the Crystal Gems live in an ancient beachside temple and protect humanity from monsters and other threats. The Gems are ageless alien warriors who project female humanoid forms from magical gemstones at the core of their being. The Crystal Gems comprise Garnet, Amethyst, Pearl and Steven\u2014a young, half-human, half-Gem boy who inherited his gemstone from his mother, the Crystal Gems' former leader Rose Quartz. As Steven tries to understand his gradually expanding range of powers, he spends his days with his father Greg, his best friend Connie, his magical pet lion, other residents of Beach City, and the Gems. He explores the abilities inherited from his mother, which include fusion\u2014the ability of Gems to merge their bodies and abilities to form new, more powerful personalities.\n\nThe series's first season gradually reveals that the Crystal Gems are remnants of a great interstellar empire. During their missions they visit ruins that were once important to Gem culture but have been derelict for millennia. The Gems are cut off from the Gem homeworld, and Steven learns that many of the monsters and artifacts they encounter are Gems who were corrupted by a Gem weapon of mass destruction and can no longer maintain rational, humanoid form. By the end of the first season, Steven learns that, millennia ago, the Gem empire intended to sterilize the Earth to incubate new Gems, but Rose Quartz led her supporters, the Crystal Gems, in a violent and apparently successful rebellion against this genocidal plan. The discovery and release of Lapis Lazuli, a Gem trapped on Earth for millennia, puts the Crystal Gems at risk from the Gem empire once more, leading to the arrival of hostile envoys Peridot and Jasper.\n\nIn the second season, Peridot allies with and eventually joins the Crystal Gems to prevent Earth's destruction by a Gem \"geo-weapon\" buried in the planet. During the third season, Lapis Lazuli decides to live on Earth with Peridot; Jasper is defeated and captured; and Steven learns that his mother assassinated one of the Gem empire's matriarchs, Pink Diamond. In the fourth season, as Steven wrestles with his conflicted feelings about his mother's actions, the Gem empire leaders Blue Diamond and Yellow Diamond begin to turn their full attention to Earth. In the fifth and final season, Steven learns that in fact his mother ''was'' Pink Diamond, who faked her death to assume the identity of Rose Quartz; he uses this revelation to persuade the other Diamonds to try to take responsibility for and fix the damage they have caused.\n\n==Conception==\n[[File:Rebecca Sugar Speaking at New York Comic Con 2014 - Peter Dzubay (cropped).jpeg|thumb|upright|alt=Rebecca Sugar, a smiling, bespectacled young woman|Rebecca Sugar (creator of ''Steven Universe'') is the first woman to create a show for Cartoon Network.]]\nIn 2011, after former Cartoon Network vice-president of comedy animation Curtis Lelash asked the staff for ideas for a new series, Rebecca Sugar\u2014an artist working for the network's series ''[[Adventure Time]]''\u2014described her initial ideas for what would become ''Steven Universe'', and the project was chosen for development. While developing her show, Sugar continued working on ''Adventure Time''.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=19}}</ref> The series evolved from a short story written by Sugar entitled \"Ballad of Margo and Dread\", about a sensitive child helping teenagers with problems they cannot verbalize.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=14}}</ref>\n\nCartoon Network executives commissioned the show after the crew's art presentation and Sugar became the first woman to create a show independently for the network.<ref name=\":8\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=25}}</ref> Before a production team had been appointed, Sugar tried to alter elements of the show's plot and developed the character's identity so her crew would have the freedom she did when she worked for ''Adventure Time''.<ref name=\":3\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=43}}</ref>\n\n=== Development ===\nWhen Sugar's show was commissioned, she resigned from her role as a storyboard artist on ''Adventure Time'' to focus on her own series.<ref name=\":3\" /> Sugar focused the pilot short on the main characters and their personalities to demonstrate the series' humor. The pilot is a [[Slice of life|slice-of-life]] episode that does not involve major events because the series' world was still in development.<ref name=\":0\" /> Sugar and her production team focused the plot on interaction between the Crystal Gems and Steven.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=24\u201325}}</ref> Sugar strove to make her pilot distinctive in terms of its artistic and aesthetic detail but the time limit imposed upon her by Cartoon Network hampered her. This unsuccessful experience helped Sugar develop the show's concept; she said, \"to know that there is so much more that you can't see and the way that knowledge frustrates and excites and confuses and scares you\".<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nThe title character Steven is loosely based on Steven Sugar, Rebecca's younger brother.<ref name=\"Cavna 2013-11-01\" /> During ''Steven Universe''{{'s}} development, Sugar repeatedly asked her brother whether naming the show after him was a good idea; she stopped asking when it was commissioned. Her brother had no problem with it and trusted Sugar to use his name wisely.<ref name=\":4\" /> In an interview with the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]],'' Sugar discussed developing the background of the show's protagonist, saying she wanted to base the character's viewpoint on her brother growing up \"where you're so comfortable in your life because you get all the attention, but you also want to rise up and not be the little brother\".<ref name=\"Ito 2013-07-26\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/28/movies/rising-animators-spring-into-motion.html|title=Rising Animators Spring Into Motion|last=Ito|first=Robert|date=July 26, 2013|work=New York Times|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130803055430/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/28/movies/rising-animators-spring-into-motion.html|archivedate=August 3, 2013|url-status=live|author2=Jeremy Egner|df=}}</ref>\n\nWhen the original pilot was presented to Cartoon Network executives, they told the crew the series would air in 2013.<ref name=\":8\" /> Cartoon Network released the original pilot in May 2013. Sugar and her team panicked because the series was going to be very different from the pilot episode. The pilot was popular when it was released, engendering forum discussions in which people expressed their hopes of seeing it on the air soon. Those who knew Rebecca Sugar from ''Adventure Time'' were also interested. Positive reaction to the show reassured its crew.<ref name=\":9\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=77}}</ref>\n\nTo prepare for the show's commissioning by Cartoon Network, Sugar began assembling a production crew.<ref name=\":3\" /> Jackie Buscarino was engaged as a producer in September 2012 and was tasked with hiring people and supervising the show's crew.<ref name=\":5\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=48}}</ref> During this period of development, Sugar and her team were moved to a building behind the main Cartoon Network studio and based on the same floor as the crew of ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]'' CGI special. Some artists who had worked on the special, such as colorist Tiffany Ford and art directors Kevin Dart, Ellie Michalka and Jasmin Lai, were later invited to join the ''Steven Universe'' team.<ref name=\":6\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=49}}</ref> Cartoon Network also provided Sugar with a list of suggested writers; when she saw Ben Levin and Matt Burnett (former writers for ''[[Level Up (U.S. TV series)|Level Up]]'') on the list she immediately asked them to join her team because she was familiar with their work.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=48\u201349}}</ref> Freelance artist Danny Hynes, whom the former supervising director Ian Jones-Quartey knew from his own project ''[[OK K.O.!

Michalka did the painting.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=62}}</ref>\n\n=== Design ===\nDuring the development of the ''Steven Universe'' pilot, Sugar focused much attention on the design of the world, adding notes to her drawings.<ref name=\":1\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=20}}</ref> Inspired by the idea of foreign figures (Gems) living human lives, she drew many sketches depicting their world and history. The series' design was also inspired by her and her brother's interest in video games, comics and animation.<ref name=\":0\" /> After the series was commissioned, Sugar decided to redesign everything to make the series \"flexible and simple\" for future production staff to add ideas of their own.<ref name=\":3\" /> During this time, the art director was Kevin Dart, followed by Jasmin Lai, Elle Michalka, and Ricky Cometa.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=169}}</ref> Dart's artistic style has remained a great influence on the show long after his departure. Steven Sugar praised Dart's work and was inspired by him in college years, saying Dart had more ideas for the art than he did.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nIn the pilot, only two locations appeared (the Temple and the Big Donut). The Temple was designed by Ian Jones-Quartey, Steven Sugar, Ben Levin, Matt Burnett and [[Andy Ristaino]]. The Temple's dual faces were based on Guy Davis' ideas.<ref name=\":7\" /> Steven Sugar designed the rest of Beach City for the series; he was painstaking in his attention to detail. Sugar also designed people, houses, cars, buildings and restaurants. Because of Rebecca Sugar's redesigned drawings, the two original locations had to be redrawn.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nTo find inspiration for the show's backgrounds, the Sugars and Jones-Quartey went to their favorite beaches.<ref name=\":7\" /> The series' setting, Beach City, is loosely based on Delaware beaches [[Rehoboth Beach, Delaware|Rehoboth Beach]], [[Bethany Beach, Delaware|Bethany Beach]] and [[Dewey Beach, Delaware|Dewey Beach]], all of which Rebecca Sugar visited as a child.<ref name=\"Cavna 2013-11-01\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/tv/steven-universe-creator-rebecca-sugar-is-an-idealistic-trailblazer/2013/11/01/fe622da2-4338-11e3-a751-f032898f2dbc_story.html |title='Steven Universe' creator Rebecca Sugar is a Cartoon Network trailblazer |last=Cavna |first=Michael |date=November 1, 2013 |work=The Washington Post |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111171925/https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/tv/steven-universe-creator-rebecca-sugar-is-an-idealistic-trailblazer/2013/11/01/fe622da2-4338-11e3-a751-f032898f2dbc_story.html |archive-date=November 11, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref> Steven Sugar drew Beach City with a boardwalk lined with a variety of shops.<ref name=\":6\" /> He wanted it to have a \"specific style\" so viewers could believe it was based on a real location; he drew the roads and shops consistently oriented with the Temple and a water tower.<ref name=\":7\" /> The concept for the primary setting was inspired by [[Akira Toriyama]]'s ''[[Dr. Slump]]'', which features a small environment in which the recurring characters live where they work.

The Gems' ability to shape-shift is a reference to older cartoons such as [[Tex Avery]]'s work for [[MGM]], where characters would change at will.

The series' storyboard artists are also its writers.]]\nDuring storyboard meetings, artists draw their ideas on [[post-it note]]s, which are then attached to walls, table and boxes in the corners of their conference room. The drawings play a major role in forming episode ideas; Sugar looks at these designs and occasionally makes changes to key poses. Sugar likes to review and re-draw scenes and characters to add extra pathos and emotion to storyboards.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=207}}</ref> Each episode's storyboards are created by two artists, each of whom writes half of the dialogue and draws panels similar to comic strips. This process can be quite complex; the storyboard artists must create the [[cinematography]] and focus on [[scenic design]] in a way similar to film production. After the panels are made, the thumbnail-storyboard artists draw mannerisms and dialogue based on their own experiences; Sugar draws \"quintessential\" scenes from her memories of hanging out with her brother after school.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=118}}</ref> The storyboard artists then discuss their work with the rest of the crew and make any necessary changes.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=119}}</ref> After the team discussion, the storyboard artists draw a revised board\u2014based on the thumbnail board\u2014on a full-size panel with notes. The storyboards are again discussed, corrected and finally approved.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=124}}</ref>\n\n=== Writing ===\nDuring the pilot development, Sugar wrote and sketched a number of plot ideas that later became episodes.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=21}}</ref> The series' initial premise focused mostly on Steven's human side, rather than his magic side, but the premise was later changed.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=43; 48}}</ref> Sugar developed the Gems' history in conjunction with the pilot episode.<ref name=\":0\" /> While the first season of the show introduced the human and Gem characters and their relationships, Sugar began to plot and explore second-season storylines involving the Crystal Gems.<ref name=\":16\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=111}}</ref> Eventually, Sugar created a chart with taped printouts about a 2,000-year Gem and Earth history, with a number of events needing to be \"fleshed out\" for production. Although the series' overall plot is established, the writers improvise to arrive at its ending; according to Matt Burnett, the storylines will be resolved by the series' end.<ref name=\":10\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=105}}</ref> Sugar wanted the series to focus on comedy and positivity before exploring controversial subjects involving the main characters, thinking it was \"more honest\" to begin the show with happiness instead of action or drama.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe writers\u2014formerly Levin and Burnett\u2014would write the premises and outlines while the storyboarders wrote and drew the episodes.<ref name=\":13\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=107}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://ianjq.tumblr.com/post/74241332119/hey-i-am-a-screenwriting-student-from-emerson |title=Hey!

They discuss episode pacing and vary each season's texture by balancing \"lighter\" and \"heavier\" story arcs.<ref name=\":17\" /> Changes in major-character appearances\u2014such as Yellow Diamond\u2014in a storyline can be difficult for the writers.<ref name=\":15\" /> According to Ben Levin, writing a season of ''Steven Universe'' is like a \"jigsaw puzzle\" because the writing team must assemble a number of plot ideas, which are discarded if they do not benefit character growth. After further discussion and questions about the writing, an idea becomes an episode. After discussing a season's proposed episodes the \"puzzle\" is complete, and they begin writing a major story arc or a season finale. Burnett said writing a season is like an algebraic equation \"where one side is the season finale, and the x's and y's are the episodes we need for that solution to make sense\"; he cited \"Ocean Gem\", \"[[Steven the Sword Fighter]]\", \"Monster Buddies\", \"An Indirect Kiss\" and \"Serious Steven\" as examples. Those episodes led to the season-one finale as a minor story arc.<ref name=\":17\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=106}}</ref> To develop new ideas for episodes, the writers play writing games. In one, a scenario with characters is drawn and passed to another writer. The second writer adds a few sentences before giving it to a third, until the drawing has a three-act story. Episodes such as \"Island Adventure\", \"Future Boy Zoltron\" and \"Onion Friend\" were written this way.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=107\u2013108}}</ref> The writers also play drawing games, which design new Gem characters and technological ideas. Burnett said he and Levin use fewer ideas from the storyboarders than they previously did; storyboarders change fewer things than they did before because the episodes have a \"stronger continuity\".<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nAccording to Levin, he and Burnett try to balance the focus between the main characters\u2014with Steven in the center\u2014and the theme of episodes in their writing. The balance indicates Steven has the same interests on his human side as he does on his Gem side. Levin said the Gem mythology and drama would have been less interesting if Steven was not as well-developed in the first few episodes. Grateful to work on a show which is unafraid to be \"sincere and vulnerable\", he said if every episode was emotional the series would become formulaic; happy episodes balance out emotional ones.<ref name=\":17\" /> Levin said he and Burnett have found ways to integrate Steven's powers into the plot. The character's powers and home-world technology are revealed at a \"measured (very slow) pace\", satisfying the viewer and keeping the series clear of superhero territory.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nBefore significant plotlines air, the writers reveal information relevant to a \"climactic\" episode for the audience. According to storyboard artist Hilary Florido, much of the series' action and magic are narrative climaxes, demonstrating the characters' discoveries, difficulties and views. Florido said if a character's evolution is not directly related to the plot, there is no drama.<ref name=\":15\" /> The crew is discouraged from breaking perspective involving episode development as they want the audience to know the protagonist's point of view. Although the writers could hint at future events, they prefer to focus on plot and develop Steven in real time. Levin said if the pilot tried to present Gem history in five minutes, the audience and protagonist would be equally confused.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\n=== Backgrounds ===\nThe production of background art begins after the approved storyboards are received. If the characters visit old locations, the pre-existing backgrounds are modified for authenticity; it is likely locations would change slightly over time. Steven Sugar likes to hide narrative bits in the backgrounds because he believes the key to world-building is \"having a cohesive underlying structure to everything\".<ref name=\":22\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=174}}</ref> Former art director Elle Michalka said the backgrounds' artistic style was inspired by French post-impressionist painter [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], whose apparent lack of focus belied detail and specificity. The art was also inspired by [[Tao Te Ching]], whose work highlights the importance of empty spaces, \"like the space within a vase as being part of the vase that makes it useful\".<ref name=\":22\"/> During the painting phase, the painters see the lines as \"descriptive bones\" and color is used loosely, meaning the color is intentionally slightly off register, highlighting the distinction between color and line.<ref name=\":22\"/> The painters used \"superimposed\" watercolor texture before switching to [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]] because the former made the backgrounds \"very chunky\". When painting the backgrounds, they use one primary and several secondary colors; Amanda Winterston and Jasmin Lai found suitable color combinations. After the primary backgrounds are painted, they are sent to the color stylist, who chooses colors for a character or prop from model sheets, matching and complementing the storyboard and background. The lines of the character or prop are rarely colored. The lines are removed when scenes need light effects. The coloring in early season-one episodes was experimental because the stylist would have difficulty if a storyboard's character and background mixed together or a bright character walked unchanged into a shadow. Mistakes became rare as the crew planned and checked storyboards. The primary backgrounds are made in Burbank; the secondary ones by Korean artists.<ref name=\":23\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=175}}</ref>\n\n=== Animation ===\nAfter the crew finishes constructing an episode, the production team sends it to animators in Korea. The animation is produced by [[Sunmin Image Pictures]] and [[Rough Draft Studios|Rough Draft Korea]]. The production team and animators communicate by email and sometimes use video chat when animating a major episode. Before sending the episode to one of the studios, animation director Nick DeMayo and his team create a plan for the animators after reviewing the [[Storyboard#Animatics|animatics]].<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=197}}</ref> They then add character movements on [[exposure sheet]]s to guide the animators. Mouth assignments for the characters, describing mouth shapes and timing for lip-syncing, follow.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=197\u2013198}}</ref> The episode is then sent to one of the animation studios. The black-and-white version is sent first, followed about two weeks later by the colored version<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=198}}</ref> The animation is drawn and inked on paper, then scanned and colored digitally. The crew then arranges a \"work print\" meeting to discuss the episode and review it for errors. DeMayo notes any errors, removes them and sends the episode back to the animation studio or to Cartoon Network's post-production department to fix any remaining issues.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=199}}</ref> Minor animation mistakes or omissions are fixed by the crew.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=202}}</ref>\n\n=== Voice cast ===\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=220\n| image1 = Zach Callison January 2015.jpg  |width1=1182|height1=1769 |alt1= Zach Callison smiling, wearing a blue \"85\" numbered shirt\n| image2 = Michaela Dietz at the Florida Supercon 2016 (4) (cropped).jpg  |width2=1791|height2=2602 |alt2= Michaela Dietz, smiling and holding a microphone\n| image3 = Deedee Magno Hall (2010).jpg  |width3=1096|height3=1677 |alt3= A smiling Deedee Magno in a black jacket.\n| image4 = Estelle Swaray (headshot).jpg|width4=197|height4=244 |alt4= Estelle, smiling, in a blue jacket\n| footer = The main voice cast ''(clockwise from top left''): [[Zach Callison]] ([[Steven Universe (character)|Steven]]), [[Michaela Dietz]] ([[Amethyst (Steven Universe)|Amethyst]]), [[Estelle (musician)|Estelle]] ([[Garnet (Steven Universe)|Garnet]]) and [[Deedee Magno]] ([[Pearl (Steven Universe)|Pearl]]) \n}}\nAmerican actor [[Zach Callison]] voices Steven.

Sound motifs and palettes were also created for locations, objects and abstract concepts.<ref name=\":21\" /> When Sugar or the other writers write a song for an episode, they record a demo that is sent to the composers. The same musical style for a song and the character singing it is used for each song. Over time, the songs have become increasingly complex and production has become more difficult because the show's original musical style no longer fits perfectly with the newer lyrical themes. An example is \"Here Comes a Thought\", sung by Estelle and [[AJ Michalka]] (who voices Stevonnie).

This is reflected in the series' outreach to minorities that seldom appear elsewhere in animation and its broader themes; instead of delivering genre-typical, mustache-twirling villains, ''Steven Universe'' \"deals with issues of extraordinary violence and horror, depicts its characters in shades of grey, and subtly plays with matters of philosophy, morality, and interpersonal conflicts, all while refusing to reset any development to a ''status quo''\".<ref name=\"Pop Matters 15 January 2016\" />\n\n====Gender and sexuality====\n[[File:Pearl and Rose embracing in Steven Universe.jpg|thumb|Pearl (left) and Steven's mother, Rose Quartz, embrace in a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] shot edited out of the British broadcast.

Whitbrook characterized the series as being \"about love\u2014''all'' kinds of love\", including non-traditional forms such as the motherly and friendly bond between Steven and the Gems; and Garnet as the \"physical embodiment of a lesbian relationship\".<ref name=\"io9 16 June 2015\" />\n\nWhen placing the series on the honor list of the 2015 [[James Tiptree Jr. Award|Tiptree Award]], which recognizes works of science fiction or fantasy that explore and expand gender roles, the jury wrote; \"In the context of children's television, this show deals with gender in a much more open and mature way than is typical for the genre, and has some of the best writing of any cartoon&nbsp;...

This, according to Rude, reflects the growing prominence of these themes in children's cartoons; previous depictions were subtextual or minimal, such as the 2011 ''Adventure Time'' episode \"[[What Was Missing]]\", the 2014 series ''[[Clarence (2014 TV series)|Clarence]]'' or (more explicit but unexplored) the 2014 finale of Nickelodeon's ''[[The Legend of Korra]]''.

In her view, queer youth deserve to see themselves in stories as much as other children\u2014and, given pervasive [[heteronormativity]], not allowing them to do so can be harmful.

Its pilot was first shown on May 21, 2013, and the series premiered on November 4, 2013. Its fifth and final season concluded in January 2019. The TV film ''[[Steven Universe: The Movie]]'' was released on September 2, 2019, and an epilogue [[Limited series (television)|limited series]], ''[[Steven Universe Future]]'', premiered on December 7, 2019 and ended on March 27, 2020.\n\nThe themes of the series include love, family, and the importance of healthy interpersonal relationships. Sugar based the lead character on her younger brother Steven, who is an artist for the series. She developed ''Steven Universe'' while she was a writer and storyboard artist on ''[[Adventure Time]]'', which she left when Cartoon Network commissioned her series for full production. The series is storyboard-driven; when episodes are being produced the show's storyboard artists are responsible for writing the dialogue and creating the action. Books, comics and video games based on the series have been released. \n\nThe series has developed a broad fan base and has been critically acclaimed for its design, music, voice acting, characterization, prominence of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] themes and [[science fantasy]] worldbuilding. The series won its first [[GLAAD Media Award]] for Outstanding Kids & Family Program in [[30th GLAAD Media Awards|2019]], becoming the first animated series to win the award. It also received its first [[Peabody Award]] for Children's & Youth Programming in 2019. It has been nominated for five [[Primetime Emmy Award for Short-format Animation|Emmy Awards]] and five [[Annie Awards]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n''Steven Universe'' is set in the fictional town of Beach City, [[Delmarva]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sugar|first1=Rebecca|title=I am Rebecca Sugar, creator of Steven Universe, and former Adventure Time storyboarder, AMA!|date=August 20, 2014|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2e4gmx/i_am_rebecca_sugar_creator_of_steven_universe_and/cjw4mo6|website=[[Reddit]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151213200144/https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2e4gmx/i_am_rebecca_sugar_creator_of_steven_universe_and/cjw4mo6|archivedate=December 13, 2015|df=}}</ref> where the Crystal Gems live in an ancient beachside temple and protect humanity from monsters and other threats. The Gems are ageless alien warriors who project female humanoid forms from magical gemstones at the core of their being. The Crystal Gems comprise Garnet, Amethyst, Pearl and Steven\u2014a young, half-human, half-Gem boy who inherited his gemstone from his mother, the Crystal Gems' former leader Rose Quartz. As Steven tries to understand his gradually expanding range of powers, he spends his days with his father Greg, his best friend Connie, his magical pet lion, other residents of Beach City, and the Gems. He explores the abilities inherited from his mother, which include fusion\u2014the ability of Gems to merge their bodies and abilities to form new, more powerful personalities.\n\nThe series's first season gradually reveals that the Crystal Gems are remnants of a great interstellar empire. During their missions they visit ruins that were once important to Gem culture but have been derelict for millennia. The Gems are cut off from the Gem homeworld, and Steven learns that many of the monsters and artifacts they encounter are Gems who were corrupted by a Gem weapon of mass destruction and can no longer maintain rational, humanoid form. By the end of the first season, Steven learns that, millennia ago, the Gem empire intended to sterilize the Earth to incubate new Gems, but Rose Quartz led her supporters, the Crystal Gems, in a violent and apparently successful rebellion against this genocidal plan. The discovery and release of Lapis Lazuli, a Gem trapped on Earth for millennia, puts the Crystal Gems at risk from the Gem empire once more, leading to the arrival of hostile envoys Peridot and Jasper.\n\nIn the second season, Peridot allies with and eventually joins the Crystal Gems to prevent Earth's destruction by a Gem \"geo-weapon\" buried in the planet. During the third season, Lapis Lazuli decides to live on Earth with Peridot; Jasper is defeated and captured; and Steven learns that his mother assassinated one of the Gem empire's matriarchs, Pink Diamond. In the fourth season, as Steven wrestles with his conflicted feelings about his mother's actions, the Gem empire leaders Blue Diamond and Yellow Diamond begin to turn their full attention to Earth. In the fifth and final season, Steven learns that in fact his mother ''was'' Pink Diamond, who faked her death to assume the identity of Rose Quartz; he uses this revelation to persuade the other Diamonds to try to take responsibility for and fix the damage they have caused.\n\n==Conception==\n[[File:Rebecca Sugar Speaking at New York Comic Con 2014 - Peter Dzubay (cropped).jpeg|thumb|upright|alt=Rebecca Sugar, a smiling, bespectacled young woman|Rebecca Sugar (creator of ''Steven Universe'') is the first woman to create a show for Cartoon Network.]]\nIn 2011, after former Cartoon Network vice-president of comedy animation Curtis Lelash asked the staff for ideas for a new series, Rebecca Sugar\u2014an artist working for the network's series ''[[Adventure Time]]''\u2014described her initial ideas for what would become ''Steven Universe'', and the project was chosen for development.

The pilot was popular when it was released, engendering forum discussions in which people expressed their hopes of seeing it on the air soon. Those who knew Rebecca Sugar from ''Adventure Time'' were also interested. Positive reaction to the show reassured its crew.<ref name=\":9\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=77}}</ref>\n\nTo prepare for the show's commissioning by Cartoon Network, Sugar began assembling a production crew.<ref name=\":3\" /> Jackie Buscarino was engaged as a producer in September 2012 and was tasked with hiring people and supervising the show's crew.<ref name=\":5\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=48}}</ref> During this period of development, Sugar and her team were moved to a building behind the main Cartoon Network studio and based on the same floor as the crew of ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]'' CGI special.

After further discussion and questions about the writing, an idea becomes an episode. After discussing a season's proposed episodes the \"puzzle\" is complete, and they begin writing a major story arc or a season finale. Burnett said writing a season is like an algebraic equation \"where one side is the season finale, and the x's and y's are the episodes we need for that solution to make sense\"; he cited \"Ocean Gem\", \"[[Steven the Sword Fighter]]\", \"Monster Buddies\", \"An Indirect Kiss\" and \"Serious Steven\" as examples. Those episodes led to the season-one finale as a minor story arc.<ref name=\":17\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=106}}</ref> To develop new ideas for episodes, the writers play writing games. In one, a scenario with characters is drawn and passed to another writer. The second writer adds a few sentences before giving it to a third, until the drawing has a three-act story. Episodes such as \"Island Adventure\", \"Future Boy Zoltron\" and \"Onion Friend\" were written this way.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=107\u2013108}}</ref> The writers also play drawing games, which design new Gem characters and technological ideas. Burnett said he and Levin use fewer ideas from the storyboarders than they previously did; storyboarders change fewer things than they did before because the episodes have a \"stronger continuity\".<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nAccording to Levin, he and Burnett try to balance the focus between the main characters\u2014with Steven in the center\u2014and the theme of episodes in their writing. The balance indicates Steven has the same interests on his human side as he does on his Gem side. Levin said the Gem mythology and drama would have been less interesting if Steven was not as well-developed in the first few episodes. Grateful to work on a show which is unafraid to be \"sincere and vulnerable\", he said if every episode was emotional the series would become formulaic; happy episodes balance out emotional ones.<ref name=\":17\" /> Levin said he and Burnett have found ways to integrate Steven's powers into the plot. The character's powers and home-world technology are revealed at a \"measured (very slow) pace\", satisfying the viewer and keeping the series clear of superhero territory.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nBefore significant plotlines air, the writers reveal information relevant to a \"climactic\" episode for the audience. According to storyboard artist Hilary Florido, much of the series' action and magic are narrative climaxes, demonstrating the characters' discoveries, difficulties and views. Florido said if a character's evolution is not directly related to the plot, there is no drama.<ref name=\":15\" /> The crew is discouraged from breaking perspective involving episode development as they want the audience to know the protagonist's point of view. Although the writers could hint at future events, they prefer to focus on plot and develop Steven in real time. Levin said if the pilot tried to present Gem history in five minutes, the audience and protagonist would be equally confused.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\n=== Backgrounds ===\nThe production of background art begins after the approved storyboards are received. If the characters visit old locations, the pre-existing backgrounds are modified for authenticity; it is likely locations would change slightly over time. Steven Sugar likes to hide narrative bits in the backgrounds because he believes the key to world-building is \"having a cohesive underlying structure to everything\".<ref name=\":22\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=174}}</ref> Former art director Elle Michalka said the backgrounds' artistic style was inspired by French post-impressionist painter [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], whose apparent lack of focus belied detail and specificity. The art was also inspired by [[Tao Te Ching]], whose work highlights the importance of empty spaces, \"like the space within a vase as being part of the vase that makes it useful\".<ref name=\":22\"/> During the painting phase, the painters see the lines as \"descriptive bones\" and color is used loosely, meaning the color is intentionally slightly off register, highlighting the distinction between color and line.<ref name=\":22\"/> The painters used \"superimposed\" watercolor texture before switching to [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]] because the former made the backgrounds \"very chunky\". When painting the backgrounds, they use one primary and several secondary colors; Amanda Winterston and Jasmin Lai found suitable color combinations. After the primary backgrounds are painted, they are sent to the color stylist, who chooses colors for a character or prop from model sheets, matching and complementing the storyboard and background. The lines of the character or prop are rarely colored. The lines are removed when scenes need light effects. The coloring in early season-one episodes was experimental because the stylist would have difficulty if a storyboard's character and background mixed together or a bright character walked unchanged into a shadow. Mistakes became rare as the crew planned and checked storyboards. The primary backgrounds are made in Burbank; the secondary ones by Korean artists.<ref name=\":23\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=175}}</ref>\n\n=== Animation ===\nAfter the crew finishes constructing an episode, the production team sends it to animators in Korea. The animation is produced by [[Sunmin Image Pictures]] and [[Rough Draft Studios|Rough Draft Korea]]. The production team and animators communicate by email and sometimes use video chat when animating a major episode. Before sending the episode to one of the studios, animation director Nick DeMayo and his team create a plan for the animators after reviewing the [[Storyboard#Animatics|animatics]].<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=197}}</ref> They then add character movements on [[exposure sheet]]s to guide the animators. Mouth assignments for the characters, describing mouth shapes and timing for lip-syncing, follow.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=197\u2013198}}</ref> The episode is then sent to one of the animation studios. The black-and-white version is sent first, followed about two weeks later by the colored version<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=198}}</ref> The animation is drawn and inked on paper, then scanned and colored digitally. The crew then arranges a \"work print\" meeting to discuss the episode and review it for errors. DeMayo notes any errors, removes them and sends the episode back to the animation studio or to Cartoon Network's post-production department to fix any remaining issues.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=199}}</ref> Minor animation mistakes or omissions are fixed by the crew.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=202}}</ref>\n\n=== Voice cast ===\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=220\n| image1 = Zach Callison January 2015.jpg  |width1=1182|height1=1769 |alt1= Zach Callison smiling, wearing a blue \"85\" numbered shirt\n| image2 = Michaela Dietz at the Florida Supercon 2016 (4) (cropped).jpg  |width2=1791|height2=2602 |alt2= Michaela Dietz, smiling and holding a microphone\n| image3 = Deedee Magno Hall (2010).jpg  |width3=1096|height3=1677 |alt3= A smiling Deedee Magno in a black jacket.\n| image4 = Estelle Swaray (headshot).jpg|width4=197|height4=244 |alt4= Estelle, smiling, in a blue jacket\n| footer = The main voice cast ''(clockwise from top left''): [[Zach Callison]] ([[Steven Universe (character)|Steven]]), [[Michaela Dietz]] ([[Amethyst (Steven Universe)|Amethyst]]), [[Estelle (musician)|Estelle]] ([[Garnet (Steven Universe)|Garnet]]) and [[Deedee Magno]] ([[Pearl (Steven Universe)|Pearl]]) \n}}\nAmerican actor [[Zach Callison]] voices Steven.

When a recording session begins, Sugar explains the storyboards and describes the sequences, character intention and the relationship between them; Osborne does the recording.

The same musical style for a song and the character singing it is used for each song. Over time, the songs have become increasingly complex and production has become more difficult because the show's original musical style no longer fits perfectly with the newer lyrical themes. An example is \"Here Comes a Thought\", sung by Estelle and [[AJ Michalka]] (who voices Stevonnie).

This is reflected in the series' outreach to minorities that seldom appear elsewhere in animation and its broader themes; instead of delivering genre-typical, mustache-twirling villains, ''Steven Universe'' \"deals with issues of extraordinary violence and horror, depicts its characters in shades of grey, and subtly plays with matters of philosophy, morality, and interpersonal conflicts, all while refusing to reset any development to a ''status quo''\".<ref name=\"Pop Matters 15 January 2016\" />\n\n====Gender and sexuality====\n[[File:Pearl and Rose embracing in Steven Universe.jpg|thumb|Pearl (left) and Steven's mother, Rose Quartz, embrace in a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] shot edited out of the British broadcast.

Club'', who noted that \"the show's superheroes are all women\".<ref name=\"A.V. Club 4 November 2015\" /> As a self-aware pastiche of \"[[magical girl]]\" anime, the series subverts the genre's premises by having Steven embody the loving femininity of the typical magical-girl protagonist without ridicule or losing his masculine side. Whitbrook characterized the series as being \"about love\u2014''all'' kinds of love\", including non-traditional forms such as the motherly and friendly bond between Steven and the Gems; and Garnet as the \"physical embodiment of a lesbian relationship\".<ref name=\"io9 16 June 2015\" />\n\nWhen placing the series on the honor list of the 2015 [[James Tiptree Jr. Award|Tiptree Award]], which recognizes works of science fiction or fantasy that explore and expand gender roles, the jury wrote; \"In the context of children's television, this show deals with gender in a much more open and mature way than is typical for the genre, and has some of the best writing of any cartoon&nbsp;...

This, according to Rude, reflects the growing prominence of these themes in children's cartoons; previous depictions were subtextual or minimal, such as the 2011 ''Adventure Time'' episode \"[[What Was Missing]]\", the 2014 series ''[[Clarence (2014 TV series)|Clarence]]'' or (more explicit but unexplored) the 2014 finale of Nickelodeon's ''[[The Legend of Korra]]''.

With the release came the announcement that ''Music for Cars'' was no longer an album, but rather an \"era\" containing two albums, scrapping the planned ''Drive Like I Do'' album in favour of releasing a fourth studio album in May 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Beats1/status/1002263450632925184|title=Beats 1 on Twitter|date=|website=Twitter|access-date=2 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn 21 February 2019, the band announced that the first single from the album would release on 31 May, with the album following \"before [[Reading Festival]]\", which took place on 23 August 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://substreammagazine.com/2019/02/matty-healy-confirms-the-1975s-first-notes-on-a-conditional-form-single-will-be-out-may-31st/|title=Matty Healy confirms the 1975's first 'Notes on a Conditional Form' single will be out May 31st|date=|website=substreammagazine.com|access-date=5 Mar 2019}}</ref>\n\nDuring a [[r/IAmA|Reddit AMA]] on 5 March 2019, a fan asked if the album would be an emo record, to which Healy responded \"Kind of yeah\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/the1975/comments/axrn49/its_me_im_here_im_watching/ehvmaj8/|title=ACKLIOS comments on It's me I'm here I'm Watching |work=Reddit |accessdate=18 April 2019}}</ref> He later reiterated the comment in an article with ''[[NME]]'' on 15 April 2019; \"I'm an active emo man I suppose I'd call myself, I think that bands when they get to a stage that maybe we're in they wanna kind of graduate into being like a massive rock band whereas we wanna graduate like into being a small emo band, if you know what I mean\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/matty-healy-teases-details-and-artwork-of-the-1975s-sort-of-emo-new-album-notes-on-a-conditional-form-2476868|title=Matty Healy teases details and artwork of The 1975\u2019s \u201csort of emo\u201d new album, 'Notes On A Conditional Form'|work=NME |accessdate=18 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn 14 April 2019, Healy also shared a promotional image on [[Twitter]] teasing artwork for the album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Truman_Black/status/1117532166060224513|title=matty on Twitter: Notes On A Conditional Form |work=NME |accessdate=18 April 2019}}</ref> Three days later, Healy retweeted a video of him performing an unreleased song titled \"Jesus Christ 2005 God Bless America\", and adding the caption \"Notes\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Truman_Black/status/1118676264414367744|title=matty on Twitter: Notes | via=Twitter|access-date=18 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn 23 July 2019, as with all other eras, all social media pages associated with the band became deactivated. The next day, all band accounts were reactivated and the first song on the album, ''The 1975'', was released, featuring a monologue from climate change activist [[Greta Thunberg]].
