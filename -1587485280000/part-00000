Billy Graham conducted 417 crusades in 185 countries and territories on six continents. The first Billy Graham evangelistic campaign, held September 13\u201321, 1947, in the Civic Auditorium in Grand Rapids, Michigan, was attended by 6,000 people. He would rent a large venue, such as a stadium, park, or street. As the sessions became larger, he arranged a group of up to 5,000 people to sing in a choir. He would preach the [[gospel]] and invite people to come forward to ask Jesus to be their saviour and pray together. The inquirers were often given a copy of the [[Gospel of John]] or a [[Bible]] study booklet. In [[Durban]], South Africa, in 1973, the crowd of some 100,000 was the first large mixed-race event in [[apartheid]] South Africa.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cswc.div.ed.ac.uk/2018/03/billy-graham-1918-2018-prophet-of-world-christianity/|title=Billy Graham (1918\u20132018): Prophet of World Christianity?|last=Stanley|first=Brian|authorlink=Brian Stanley (historian)|date=March 2, 2018|website=Centre for the Study of World Christianity|language=en-GB|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=April 13, 2020}}</ref> In [[Moscow]], in 1992, one-quarter of the 155,000 people in Graham's audience went forward at his call.<ref name=\"time1993\">Nancy Gibbs & Richard N.

Billy Graham conducted 417 crusades in 185 countries and territories on six continents. The first Billy Graham evangelistic campaign, held September 13\u201321, 1947, in the Civic Auditorium in Grand Rapids, Michigan, was attended by 6,000 people. He would rent a large venue, such as a stadium, park, or street. As the sessions became larger, he arranged a group of up to 5,000 people to sing in a choir. He would preach the [[gospel]] and invite people to come forward to ask Jesus to be their saviour and pray together. The inquirers were often given a copy of the [[Gospel of John]] or a [[Bible]] study booklet. In [[Durban]], South Africa, in 1973, the crowd of some 100,000 was the first large mixed-race event in [[apartheid]] South Africa.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cswc.div.ed.ac.uk/2018/03/billy-graham-1918-2018-prophet-of-world-christianity/|title=Billy Graham (1918\u20132018): Prophet of World Christianity?|last=Stanley|first=Brian|authorlink=Brian Stanley (historian)|date=March 2, 2018|website=Centre for the Study of World Christianity|language=en-GB|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=April 13, 2020}}</ref> In [[Moscow]], in 1992, one-quarter of the 155,000 people in Graham's audience went forward at his call.<ref name=\"time1993\">Nancy Gibbs & Richard N.

Prince Paul was overthrown, and a new anti-German government under [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter II]] and [[Du\u0161an Simovi\u0107]] took power. The new government withdrew its support for the Axis, but did not repudiate the [[Tripartite Pact]]. Nevertheless, Axis forces, led by [[Nazi Germany]] [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded Yugoslavia]] in April 1941.\n\nThe [[Independent State of Croatia]] was proclaimed by the [[Usta\u0161e]] - a Croatian fascist, racist, ultra-nationalist and terrorist organization - on 10 April 1941. Within the new state lived approximately 40,000 Jews, only 9,000 of whom would ultimately survive the war.<ref>[[Ivo Goldstein|Goldstein, Ivo]]. ''Croatia: A History'', C. Hurst & Co. Ltd., London, 1999. (p. 136)</ref>\n\nAlready prior to the war the Usta\u0161e forged close ties to fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. In 1933 the Usta\u0161e presented \"[[The Seventeen Principles]]\", which proclaimed the uniqueness of the Croatian nation, promoted collective rights over individual rights, and declared that people who were not Croat by race and blood, would be excluded from political life. In 1936, the Usta\u0161e leader, Ante Paveli\u0107, wrote in \"The Croat Question\":\n\n''\u2033Today, practically all finance and nearly all commerce in Croatia is in Jewish hands. This became possible only through the support of the state, which thereby seeks, on one hand, to strengthen the pro-Serbian Jews, and on the other, to weaken Croat national strength. The Jews celebrated the establishment of the so-called Yugoslav state with great joy, because a national Croatia could never be as useful to them as a multi-national Yugoslavia; for in national chaos lies the power of the Jews... In fact, as the Jews had foreseen, Yugoslavia became, in consequence of the corruption of official life in Serbia, a true Eldorado of Jewry...The entire press in Croatia is also in Jewish-masonic hands\u2026''\" <ref>Ante Pavelic: The Croat Question |http://chnm.gmu.edu/history/faculty/kelly/blogs/h312/wp-content/sources/pavelic.pdf</ref>\n\n==The Holocaust==\n[[File:Jewish prisoner in Jasenovac.jpg|thumb|200px|A Jewish prisoner is forced to remove his ring upon arrival in the [[Jasenovac concentration camp]].]]\n[[Image:Usta\u0161e militia execute prisoners near the Jasenovac concentration camp.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Usta\u0161e]] executing people over a mass grave near Jasenovac.]]\n\n===Anti-Semitic legislation and start of persecution===\nThe main race laws in the Independent State of Croatia were adopted and signed by the [[Usta\u0161e]] leader [[Ante Paveli\u0107]] on 30 April 1941: the \"Legal Decree on Racial Origins\" (''Zakonska odredba o rasnoj pripadnosti'') and the \"Legal Decree on the Protection of Aryan Blood and the Honour of the Croatian People\" (''Zakonska odredba o za\u0161titi arijske krvi i \u010dasti hrvatskog naroda'').<ref name =\"Zivakovic\">\u017divakovi\u0107-Ker\u017ee, Zlata. ''[http://hrcak.srce.hr/file/11347 Od \u017eidovskog naselja u Tenji do sabirnog logora]''</ref> The \"Legal Decree on the Nationalization of the Property of Jews and Jewish Companies\" was declared on 10 October 1941.\n\nActions against Jews began immediately after the [[Independent State of Croatia]] was founded. On 10\u201311 April 1941 a group of prominent Jews in Zagreb was arrested by the [[Usta\u0161e]] and held for ransom. On 13 April the same was done in Osijek, where Usta\u0161e and Volksdeutscher mobs destroyed the synagogue and Jewish graveyard.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jewish Virtual Library|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0015_0_15241.html}}</ref> This procedure was repeated in 1941 and 1942 several times with groups of Jews.\n\n===Anti-Semitic propaganda===\nThe [[Usta\u0161e]] immediately initiated intensive anti-Semitic propaganda. A day after the signing of the main race laws on 30 April 1941, the newspaper of the Usta\u0161e movement, ''Hrvatski narod (Croatian Nation)'', published across its entire front page: \"The Blood and Honor of the Croatian people protected by special provisions\".<ref name=\"Bo\u0161ko Zuckerman 1943\">Bo\u0161ko Zuckerman, \"Prilog prou\u010davanju antisemitizma i protu\u017eidovske propagande u vode\u0107em zagreba\u010dkom usta\u0161kom tisku (1941-1943)\" Zavod za hrvatsku povijest, vol 42, Zagreb (2010).<!--ISSN/ISBN needed--></ref>\n\nTwo days later, the newspaper ''Novi list'' concluded that Croatians must \"be more alert than any other ethnic group to protect their racial purity, ... We need to keep our blood clean of the Jews\". The newspaper also wrote that Jews are synonymous with \"treachery, cheating, greed, immorality and foreigness\", and therefore \"wide swaths of the Croatian people always despised the Jews and felt towards them natural revulsion\".<ref name=\"Bo\u0161ko Zuckerman 1943\"/> ''Nova Hrvatska'' (New Croatia) added that according to the Talmud, \"this toxic, hot well-spring of Jewish wickedness and malice, the Jew is even free to kill Gentiles\".<ref name=\"Bo\u0161ko Zuckerman 1943\"/>\n\nOne of the main claims of Usta\u0161e propaganda was that the Jews have always been against an independent Croatian state and against the Croatian people.

Prince Paul was overthrown, and a new anti-German government under [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter II]] and [[Du\u0161an Simovi\u0107]] took power. The new government withdrew its support for the Axis, but did not repudiate the [[Tripartite Pact]]. Nevertheless, Axis forces, led by [[Nazi Germany]] [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded Yugoslavia]] in April 1941.\n\nThe [[Independent State of Croatia]] was proclaimed by the [[Usta\u0161e]] - a Croatian fascist, racist, ultra-nationalist and terrorist organization - on 10 April 1941. Within the new state lived approximately 40,000 Jews, only 9,000 of whom would ultimately survive the war.<ref>[[Ivo Goldstein|Goldstein, Ivo]]. ''Croatia: A History'', C. Hurst & Co. Ltd., London, 1999. (p. 136)</ref>\n\nAlready prior to the war the Usta\u0161e forged close ties to fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. In 1933 the Usta\u0161e presented \"[[The Seventeen Principles]]\", which proclaimed the uniqueness of the Croatian nation, promoted collective rights over individual rights, and declared that people who were not Croat by race and blood, would be excluded from political life. In 1936, the Usta\u0161e leader, Ante Paveli\u0107, wrote in \"The Croat Question\":\n\n''\u2033Today, practically all finance and nearly all commerce in Croatia is in Jewish hands. This became possible only through the support of the state, which thereby seeks, on one hand, to strengthen the pro-Serbian Jews, and on the other, to weaken Croat national strength. The Jews celebrated the establishment of the so-called Yugoslav state with great joy, because a national Croatia could never be as useful to them as a multi-national Yugoslavia; for in national chaos lies the power of the Jews... In fact, as the Jews had foreseen, Yugoslavia became, in consequence of the corruption of official life in Serbia, a true Eldorado of Jewry...The entire press in Croatia is also in Jewish-masonic hands\u2026''\" <ref>Ante Pavelic: The Croat Question |http://chnm.gmu.edu/history/faculty/kelly/blogs/h312/wp-content/sources/pavelic.pdf</ref>\n\n==The Holocaust==\n[[File:Jewish prisoner in Jasenovac.jpg|thumb|200px|A Jewish prisoner is forced to remove his ring upon arrival in the [[Jasenovac concentration camp]].]]\n[[Image:Usta\u0161e militia execute prisoners near the Jasenovac concentration camp.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Usta\u0161e]] executing people over a mass grave near Jasenovac.]]\n\n===Anti-Semitic legislation and start of persecution===\nThe main race laws in the Independent State of Croatia were adopted and signed by the [[Usta\u0161e]] leader [[Ante Paveli\u0107]] on 30 April 1941: the \"Legal Decree on Racial Origins\" (''Zakonska odredba o rasnoj pripadnosti'') and the \"Legal Decree on the Protection of Aryan Blood and the Honour of the Croatian People\" (''Zakonska odredba o za\u0161titi arijske krvi i \u010dasti hrvatskog naroda'').<ref name =\"Zivakovic\">\u017divakovi\u0107-Ker\u017ee, Zlata.

On 10\u201311 April 1941 a group of prominent Jews in Zagreb was arrested by the [[Usta\u0161e]] and held for ransom. On 13 April the same was done in Osijek, where Usta\u0161e and Volksdeutscher mobs destroyed the synagogue and Jewish graveyard.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jewish Virtual Library|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0015_0_15241.html}}</ref> This procedure was repeated in 1941 and 1942 several times with groups of Jews.\n\n===Anti-Semitic propaganda===\nThe [[Usta\u0161e]] immediately initiated intensive anti-Semitic propaganda. A day after the signing of the main race laws on 30 April 1941, the newspaper of the Usta\u0161e movement, ''Hrvatski narod (Croatian Nation)'', published across its entire front page: \"The Blood and Honor of the Croatian people protected by special provisions\".<ref name=\"Bo\u0161ko Zuckerman 1943\">Bo\u0161ko Zuckerman, \"Prilog prou\u010davanju antisemitizma i protu\u017eidovske propagande u vode\u0107em zagreba\u010dkom usta\u0161kom tisku (1941-1943)\" Zavod za hrvatsku povijest, vol 42, Zagreb (2010).<!--ISSN/ISBN needed--></ref>\n\nTwo days later, the newspaper ''Novi list'' concluded that Croatians must \"be more alert than any other ethnic group to protect their racial purity, ... We need to keep our blood clean of the Jews\". The newspaper also wrote that Jews are synonymous with \"treachery, cheating, greed, immorality and foreigness\", and therefore \"wide swaths of the Croatian people always despised the Jews and felt towards them natural revulsion\".<ref name=\"Bo\u0161ko Zuckerman 1943\"/> ''Nova Hrvatska'' (New Croatia) added that according to the Talmud, \"this toxic, hot well-spring of Jewish wickedness and malice, the Jew is even free to kill Gentiles\".<ref name=\"Bo\u0161ko Zuckerman 1943\"/>\n\nOne of the main claims of Usta\u0161e propaganda was that the Jews have always been against an independent Croatian state and against the Croatian people. In April 1941 the newspaper ''Hrvatski narod'' (The Croatian People) accused Jews of being responsible for the \"many failures and misfortunes of so many Croatian people\", which led the Poglavnik [the Usta\u0161e leader Ante Pavelic] to \"eradicate these evils\".<ref name=\"Bo\u0161ko Zuckerman 1943\"/> A ''Spremnost'' article stated that the Usta\u0161a movement defines \"Judaism as one of the greatest enemies of the people\".<ref name=\"Bo\u0161ko Zuckerman 1943\"/>\n\nSome in the Catholic Church joined the anti-Semitic propaganda. Thus the Catholic Bishop of Sarajevo, Ivan \u0160ari\u0107, published in his diocesan newspaper that \"the movement to free the world of Jews, represents the movement for the restoration of human dignity. Omniscient and omnipotent God is behind this movement \".{{sfn|Phayer|2000|p=35}} And in July 1941, the Franciscan priest, Dionysius Juri\u010dev, in ''Novi list'' wrote that \"it is no longer a sin to kill a seven year-old child\".{{sfn|Phayer|2000|p=34}}\n\n===Usta\u0161e concentration camps===\nAlready in April 1941 the [[Usta\u0161e]] established the concentration camps Danica<ref>{{cite web|last=Despot|first=Zvonimir|title=Kako je osnovan prvi usta\u0161ki logor u NDH|url=http://blog.vecernji.hr/zvonimir-despot/2012/02/09/kako-je-osnovan-prvi-ustaski-logor-u-ndh/|publisher=Vecernji list}}</ref> (near Koprivnica), [[Kru\u0161\u010dica concentration camp]] near Travnik<ref name=\"Gilbert2002\">{{cite book|last=Gilbert|first=Martin|title=The Routledge Atlas of the Holocaust|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pYs5OSnsrHwC&pg=PA75|date=January 2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-28145-4|page=75|quote= Kruscica concentration camp set up in April 1941}}</ref> and Kerestinec, where along with communists and other political opponents, the [[Usta\u0161e]] imprisoned Jews.\n\nIn May 1941, the [[Usta\u0161e]] rounded up 165 Jewish youth in Zagreb, ages 17\u201325, most of them members of the Jewish sports club Makabi, and sent them to the Danica concentration camp (all but 3 were killed by the Usta\u0161e).<ref>{{cite web|title=HAP\u0160ENJE 165 JEVREJSKIH OMLADINACA U ZAGREBU U MAJU 1941.

Inside he discovers thirteen [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] tapes recorded by [[Hannah Baker]], his deceased classmate who killed herself two weeks earlier. On the tapes, Hannah unfolds an intensely emotional audio diary, detailing why she decided to end her life. It appears each person who receives this package of old-style tapes is fundamentally related to why she killed herself. Clay is not the first to receive the tapes, but there is an implication that he should pass the tapes on after hearing them. There appears to be an order to distribution of the tapes, with an additional copy held by an overseer should the plan go awry. Each tape recording refers to a different person involved in Hannah's life contributing to a reason for her suicide (mostly referring to both her friends and enemies).<ref>[https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Differences-Between-13-Reasons-Why-Book-TV-Show-4340472519 Big Differences Between the Book and TV Show Versions of 13 Reasons Why|POPSUGAR Entertainment]</ref>\n\nIn season two, months after Hannah's suicide, Clay and the other people mentioned on the tapes, as well as close friends and Hannah's family members, become embroiled in a civil legal battle between Hannah's parents and Liberty High School. Alleging negligence on the part of the school, Hannah's mother pursues her perception of justice, while her reluctance to settle pre-trial and her personal circumstances eventually break up her marriage with Hannah's father. The story unfolds with narratives illustrating Hannah's story told by those who were present in court at the trial.\n\nClay, who perceives himself as Hannah's failed protector, embarks on an investigation using whatever evidence he can find in an effort to impact on the civil case between Hannah's parents and the school. Clay also endeavors to expose the corrupted culture of the high school and its favor of wealthy [[Jock (stereotype)|jocks]] over the average student, which especially compromises the integrity of young girls such as Hannah.\n\nSeason three is set eight months after the end of season two. Clay and his friends are struggling to cope with the cover-up of Tyler's attempted massacre at the Spring Fling, while helping him towards recovery. However, acrimonious tensions reach a boiling point during Liberty High's Homecoming game, which results in the murder of Bryce Walker. The students of Liberty High are once again forced under the microscope as the investigation into Bryce's death threatens to expose their darkest secrets. <!-- , while the factual basis of the dramatic portrayals of the various events increasingly blur between actual portrayal and the desired perception of the various characters who present before the court during the trial. --> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popsugar.com/node/43405054|title=4 Reasons There Should Not Be Another Season of 13 Reasons Why|last=Robson|first=Shannon Vestal|date=April 28, 2017|website=POPSUGAR Entertainment|language=en-US|access-date=October 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{multiple image\n| align  = right\n| footer = [[Dylan Minnette]] and [[Katherine Langford]]\n| image1 = Dylan Minnette in 2018.jpg\n| width1 = 136\n| image2 = Katherine Langford in 2018.jpg\n| width2 = 120\n}}\n\n===Main===\n* [[Dylan Minnette]] as [[Clay Jensen]], a close friend of Hannah who becomes obsessed with finding out what happened to her<ref name=\"S1Cast\" />\n* [[Katherine Langford]] as [[Hannah Baker]] (seasons 1\u20132), a teenager whose suicide and recorded audio cassettes spark the events of the series<ref name=\"S1Cast\" />\n* [[Christian Navarro]] as Tony Padilla, Clay's best friend at Liberty High who tries to help him deal with Hannah's death\n* [[Alisha Boe]] as Jessica Davis, a student who starts attending Liberty High at the same time as Hannah<ref name=\"S1Cast\" />\n* [[Brandon Flynn]] as Justin Foley,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/09/241936/who-is-13-reasons-why-brandon-flynn-dating-now|title=Is Brandon Flynn Of 13 Reasons Why Dating Anyone After His Last Big Breakup?| first=Alexis|last=Reliford|date=September 1, 2019|accessdate=February 24, 2020|work=[[Refinery29]]}}</ref> a student at Liberty High who comes from an abusive family and is in a relationship with Jessica.<ref name=\"S1Cast\" /> He is responsible for setting the events of the series into motion by being the first person to humiliate Hannah after their first date.

Schedeen of [[IGN]] praised the cast, particularly Minnette and Langford, stating: \"Langford shines in the lead role{{nbsp}}... [and] embodies that optimism and that profound sadness [of Hannah's] as well. Minnette's Clay is, by design, a much more stoic and reserved character{{nbsp}}... and does a fine job in what's often a difficult role.\"<ref name=\"IGNresponse\" /> Gilbert of ''The Boston Globe'' praised the chemistry of Langford and Minnette, saying that \"watching these two young actors together is pure pleasure\", while Schedeen of IGN also agreed, saying that they are \"often at their best together, channeling just the right sort of warm but awkward chemistry you'd expect from two teens who can't quite admit to their feelings for one another\". Feinberg of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' also praises both actors: \"Langford's heartbreaking openness makes you root for a fate you know isn't possible. The actress' performance is full of dynamic range, setting it against Minnette's often more complicated task in differentiating between moods that mostly go from uncomfortable to gloomy to red-eyed, hygiene-starved despair.\"<ref name=\"THRresponse\" />\n\nRyan of ''Variety'' also gave praise to not only the two leads, but also the supporting cast of actors, particularly Kate Walsh's performance as Hannah's mother, which Ryan describes as \"career-best work\".<ref name=\"Varietyresponse\" /> Positive mentions from various critics, such as Ryan, Feinberg and Schedeen, were also given to the supporting cast of actors (most particularly Alisha Boe, Miles Heizer and Christian Navarro's respective performances of Jessica, Alex and Tony).

Mike Hale of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote a critical review, writing, \"the show doesn't make [Hannah's] downward progress convincing. It too often feels artificial, like a very long public service announcement.\" He also criticized the plot device that has Clay listening to the tapes one by one instead of all in one sitting like the other teens did, which Hale felt was unbelievable: \"It makes no sense as anything but a plot device, and you'll find yourself, like Clay's antagonists, yelling at him to listen to the rest of tapes already.\"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hale |first1=Mike |title=Review: '13 Reasons Why' She Killed Herself, Drawn Out on Netflix |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/arts/television/netflix-13-reasons-why-tv-review.html |accessdate=April 10, 2017 |work=The New York Times |date=March 30, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410165508/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/arts/television/netflix-13-reasons-why-tv-review.html |archivedate=April 10, 2017}}</ref>\n\nWriting for ''[[The Guardian]]'', Rebecca Nicholson praised some aspects of the series, including the performances from Minnette and Walsh, but was troubled by much of the plot, writing, \"a storyline that suggests the love of a sweet boy might have sorted all this out added to an uneasy feeling that stayed with me\". Nicholson was skeptical that the series would appeal to older viewers, unlike other series set in high school such as ''[[Freaks and Geeks]]'' and ''[[My So-Called Life]]'': \"It lacks the crossover wit of its forebears{{nbsp}}... It's too tied up in conveying the message that terrible behaviour can have horrible consequences to deal in any subtleties or shades of feeling.

At times, [Hannah] is self-possessed and indifferent at best to the behavior of the popular kids.

Alex Moen, a [[school counselor]] in Minneapolis, took issue with the series' entire plotline as \"essentially a fantasy of what someone who is considering suicide might have\u2014that once you commit suicide, you can still communicate with your loved ones, and people will suddenly realize everything that you were going through and the depth of your pain{{nbsp}}... That the cute, sensitive boy will fall in love with you and seek justice for you, and you'll be able to orchestrate it, and in so doing kind of still be able to live.\"<ref name=\"Slate piece\" /> Other counselors criticized the depiction of Hannah's attempt to reach out to Mr. Porter as dangerously misleading, since not only does he miss obvious signs of her suicidal ideations, but says he cannot report her sexual assault to the police without her identifying the assailant. School counselors are often portrayed as ineffective or clueless in popular culture, Moen says, but Porter's behavior in the series goes beyond that, to being unethical and possibly illegal. \"It's ridiculous! Counselors are not police. We don't have to launch an investigation. We bring whatever information we do have to the police\", she told ''[[Slate (website)|Slate]]''.<ref name=\"Slate piece\" />\n\nIn May 2017, the [[Canadian Mental Health Association]] (CMHA) along with the Centre for Suicide Prevention (CSP) released a statement with similar concerns to the ones raised by NASP. CMHA believed that the series may glamorize suicide, and that some content may lead to distress in viewers, particularly in younger viewers. Furthermore, the portrayal of Hannah's suicide does not follow the media guidelines as set out by the Canadian Association for Suicide Prevention (CASP) and the [[American Association of Suicidology]]. CMHA and CASP did praise the series for raising awareness about \"[[suicide|this preventable health concern]],\" adding that, \"Raising awareness needs to be done in a safe and responsible manner. A large and growing body of Canadian and international research has found clear links between increases in suicide rates and harmful media portrayals of suicide.\" Ways in which the portrayals of suicide may cause harm, according to CMHA and CASP, include the following: \"They may simplify suicide, such as, by suggesting that bullying alone is the cause; they may make suicide seem romantic, such as, by putting it in the context of a Hollywood plot line; they may portray suicide as a logical or viable option; they may display graphic representations of suicide which may be harmful to viewers, especially young ones; and/or they may advance the false notion that suicides are a way to teach others a lesson.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmha.ca/news/cmha-national-statement-responding-netflix-series-13-reasons/ |title=CMHA National Statement Responding to Netflix Series: 13 Reasons Why \u2013 Canadian Mental Health Association |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170504044326/http://www.cmha.ca/news/cmha-national-statement-responding-netflix-series-13-reasons/ |archivedate=May 4, 2017}}</ref><ref>[http://www.nasponline.org/assets/documents/Resources%20and%20Publications/Resources/Crisis/13%20Reasons%20Why%20Guidance_FINAL.pdf National Association of School Psychologists.

for [[Netflix]] as limited series by [[Brian Yorkey]], based on the 2007 novel ''[[Thirteen Reasons Why]]'' by [[Jay Asher]]. The series revolves around seventeen-year-old high school student [[Clay Jensen]] and his deceased friend [[Hannah Baker]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/13-reasons-why/1032508|title=13 Reasons Why |website=TVGuide.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref> who takes her own life after having to face a culture of gossip, bullying and sexual assault at her high school and a lack of support from her friends, her family and her school. A box of [[Compact Cassette|cassette tapes]] recorded by Hannah in the weeks preceding her suicide detail why she chose to end her life. The series is produced by July Moon Productions, Kicked to the Curb Productions, [[Anonymous Content]] and [[Paramount Television]], with Yorkey and [[Diana Son]] serving as [[showrunners]].\n\n[[Dylan Minnette]] stars as Clay Jensen, while [[Katherine Langford]] plays [[Hannah Baker]].

A film from [[Universal Pictures]] based on ''Thirteen Reasons Why'' began development in February 2011, with [[Selena Gomez]] set to star as Hannah, before being shelved in favor of a television series and Netflix ordering an adaptation as a limited series in October 2015, with Gomez instead serving as an executive producer. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/selena-gomez-13-reasons-why-netflix-1201620194/ |title=Netflix Adapting '13 Reasons Why' Into Selena Gomez Series (Exclusive) |last=Wagmeister |first=Elizabeth |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=October 29, 2015 |accessdate=June 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe first season was released on Netflix on March 31, 2017.

Inside he discovers thirteen [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] tapes recorded by [[Hannah Baker]], his deceased classmate who killed herself two weeks earlier. On the tapes, Hannah unfolds an intensely emotional audio diary, detailing why she decided to end her life. It appears each person who receives this package of old-style tapes is fundamentally related to why she killed herself. Clay is not the first to receive the tapes, but there is an implication that he should pass the tapes on after hearing them. There appears to be an order to distribution of the tapes, with an additional copy held by an overseer should the plan go awry. Each tape recording refers to a different person involved in Hannah's life contributing to a reason for her suicide (mostly referring to both her friends and enemies).<ref>[https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Differences-Between-13-Reasons-Why-Book-TV-Show-4340472519 Big Differences Between the Book and TV Show Versions of 13 Reasons Why|POPSUGAR Entertainment]</ref>\n\nIn season two, months after Hannah's suicide, Clay and the other people mentioned on the tapes, as well as close friends and Hannah's family members, become embroiled in a civil legal battle between Hannah's parents and Liberty High School. Alleging negligence on the part of the school, Hannah's mother pursues her perception of justice, while her reluctance to settle pre-trial and her personal circumstances eventually break up her marriage with Hannah's father. The story unfolds with narratives illustrating Hannah's story told by those who were present in court at the trial.\n\nClay, who perceives himself as Hannah's failed protector, embarks on an investigation using whatever evidence he can find in an effort to impact on the civil case between Hannah's parents and the school. Clay also endeavors to expose the corrupted culture of the high school and its favor of wealthy [[Jock (stereotype)|jocks]] over the average student, which especially compromises the integrity of young girls such as Hannah.\n\nSeason three is set eight months after the end of season two. Clay and his friends are struggling to cope with the cover-up of Tyler's attempted massacre at the Spring Fling, while helping him towards recovery. However, acrimonious tensions reach a boiling point during Liberty High's Homecoming game, which results in the murder of Bryce Walker. The students of Liberty High are once again forced under the microscope as the investigation into Bryce's death threatens to expose their darkest secrets. <!-- , while the factual basis of the dramatic portrayals of the various events increasingly blur between actual portrayal and the desired perception of the various characters who present before the court during the trial. --> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popsugar.com/node/43405054|title=4 Reasons There Should Not Be Another Season of 13 Reasons Why|last=Robson|first=Shannon Vestal|date=April 28, 2017|website=POPSUGAR Entertainment|language=en-US|access-date=October 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{multiple image\n| align  = right\n| footer = [[Dylan Minnette]] and [[Katherine Langford]]\n| image1 = Dylan Minnette in 2018.jpg\n| width1 = 136\n| image2 = Katherine Langford in 2018.jpg\n| width2 = 120\n}}\n\n===Main===\n* [[Dylan Minnette]] as [[Clay Jensen]], a close friend of Hannah who becomes obsessed with finding out what happened to her<ref name=\"S1Cast\" />\n* [[Katherine Langford]] as [[Hannah Baker]] (seasons 1\u20132), a teenager whose suicide and recorded audio cassettes spark the events of the series<ref name=\"S1Cast\" />\n* [[Christian Navarro]] as Tony Padilla, Clay's best friend at Liberty High who tries to help him deal with Hannah's death\n* [[Alisha Boe]] as Jessica Davis, a student who starts attending Liberty High at the same time as Hannah<ref name=\"S1Cast\" />\n* [[Brandon Flynn]] as Justin Foley,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/09/241936/who-is-13-reasons-why-brandon-flynn-dating-now|title=Is Brandon Flynn Of 13 Reasons Why Dating Anyone After His Last Big Breakup?| first=Alexis|last=Reliford|date=September 1, 2019|accessdate=February 24, 2020|work=[[Refinery29]]}}</ref> a student at Liberty High who comes from an abusive family and is in a relationship with Jessica.<ref name=\"S1Cast\" /> He is responsible for setting the events of the series into motion by being the first person to humiliate Hannah after their first date.

Schedeen of [[IGN]] praised the cast, particularly Minnette and Langford, stating: \"Langford shines in the lead role{{nbsp}}... [and] embodies that optimism and that profound sadness [of Hannah's] as well. Minnette's Clay is, by design, a much more stoic and reserved character{{nbsp}}... and does a fine job in what's often a difficult role.\"<ref name=\"IGNresponse\" /> Gilbert of ''The Boston Globe'' praised the chemistry of Langford and Minnette, saying that \"watching these two young actors together is pure pleasure\", while Schedeen of IGN also agreed, saying that they are \"often at their best together, channeling just the right sort of warm but awkward chemistry you'd expect from two teens who can't quite admit to their feelings for one another\". Feinberg of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' also praises both actors: \"Langford's heartbreaking openness makes you root for a fate you know isn't possible. The actress' performance is full of dynamic range, setting it against Minnette's often more complicated task in differentiating between moods that mostly go from uncomfortable to gloomy to red-eyed, hygiene-starved despair.\"<ref name=\"THRresponse\" />\n\nRyan of ''Variety'' also gave praise to not only the two leads, but also the supporting cast of actors, particularly Kate Walsh's performance as Hannah's mother, which Ryan describes as \"career-best work\".<ref name=\"Varietyresponse\" /> Positive mentions from various critics, such as Ryan, Feinberg and Schedeen, were also given to the supporting cast of actors (most particularly Alisha Boe, Miles Heizer and Christian Navarro's respective performances of Jessica, Alex and Tony). Liz Shannon Miller of ''[[Indiewire]]'', who enjoyed the series and gave it a positive score of B+, gave praise to the racial, gender and complex diversity of its supporting cast of teens.<ref name=\"Varietyresponse\" /><ref name=\"IGNresponse\" /><ref name=\"THRresponse\" /><ref name=\"Indiewireresponse\" />\n\nAnother aspect frequently mentioned within reviews was the series's mature and emotional approach to its dark and adult subject matter. This was favorably reviewed by critics, such as Miller of ''Indiewire'', particularly her statement that \"the adult edges to this story ring with honesty and truth.\"<ref name=\"Indiewireresponse\">{{cite web |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2017/03/13-reasons-why-review-netflix-suicide-1201799484/ |title='13 Reasons Why' review: Netflix brings a brutally adult edge to a tale of teen suicide |website=[[Indiewire]] |date=March 31, 2017 |last=Miller |first=Liz Shannon |accessdate=April 8, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410050418/https://www.indiewire.com/2017/03/13-reasons-why-review-netflix-suicide-1201799484/ |archivedate=April 10, 2017}}</ref> Miller, and Feinberg of ''The Hollywood Reporter'', also stated that the series can be difficult to watch at times,<ref name=\"THRresponse\" /> while Schedeen of IGN states that it is \"an often depressing and even uncomfortable show to watch{{nbsp}}... a pretty emotionally draining experience, particularly towards the end as the pieces really start to fall into place.\"<ref name=\"IGNresponse\" />\n\nCritics also praised several other aspects of the series. Feinberg highlighted the series' directors, saying: \"A Sundance-friendly gallery of directors including Tom McCarthy, Gregg Araki and Carl Franklin keeps the performances grounded and the extremes from feeling exploitative\",<ref name=\"Indiewireresponse\" /> while Gilbert of ''The Boston Globe'' praised the storytelling: \"The storytelling techniques are powerful{{nbsp}}... [as it] builds on the world established in the previous hour, as we continually encounter new facets of Hannah's life and new characters. The background on the show keeps getting deeper, richer.\"<ref name=\"BGresponse\" />\n\nConversely, the series has also received criticism over its portrayal of teen angst. Mike Hale of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote a critical review, writing, \"the show doesn't make [Hannah's] downward progress convincing. It too often feels artificial, like a very long public service announcement.\" He also criticized the plot device that has Clay listening to the tapes one by one instead of all in one sitting like the other teens did, which Hale felt was unbelievable: \"It makes no sense as anything but a plot device, and you'll find yourself, like Clay's antagonists, yelling at him to listen to the rest of tapes already.\"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hale |first1=Mike |title=Review: '13 Reasons Why' She Killed Herself, Drawn Out on Netflix |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/arts/television/netflix-13-reasons-why-tv-review.html |accessdate=April 10, 2017 |work=The New York Times |date=March 30, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410165508/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/arts/television/netflix-13-reasons-why-tv-review.html |archivedate=April 10, 2017}}</ref>\n\nWriting for ''[[The Guardian]]'', Rebecca Nicholson praised some aspects of the series, including the performances from Minnette and Walsh, but was troubled by much of the plot, writing, \"a storyline that suggests the love of a sweet boy might have sorted all this out added to an uneasy feeling that stayed with me\". Nicholson was skeptical that the series would appeal to older viewers, unlike other series set in high school such as ''[[Freaks and Geeks]]'' and ''[[My So-Called Life]]'': \"It lacks the crossover wit of its forebears{{nbsp}}... It's too tied up in conveying the message that terrible behaviour can have horrible consequences to deal in any subtleties or shades of feeling. It's largely one-note \u2013 and that note is horrifying.

He praised Langford's \"stunning performance\" but noted, \"There are times when we simply don't believe the characters, when what they do or say isn't consistent with who we've been led to believe they are{{nbsp}}... At times, [Hannah] is self-possessed and indifferent at best to the behavior of the popular kids. At other times, though, relatively minor misperceived slights seem to send her into an emotional tailspin.

Alex Moen, a [[school counselor]] in Minneapolis, took issue with the series' entire plotline as \"essentially a fantasy of what someone who is considering suicide might have\u2014that once you commit suicide, you can still communicate with your loved ones, and people will suddenly realize everything that you were going through and the depth of your pain{{nbsp}}... That the cute, sensitive boy will fall in love with you and seek justice for you, and you'll be able to orchestrate it, and in so doing kind of still be able to live.\"<ref name=\"Slate piece\" /> Other counselors criticized the depiction of Hannah's attempt to reach out to Mr. Porter as dangerously misleading, since not only does he miss obvious signs of her suicidal ideations, but says he cannot report her sexual assault to the police without her identifying the assailant. School counselors are often portrayed as ineffective or clueless in popular culture, Moen says, but Porter's behavior in the series goes beyond that, to being unethical and possibly illegal. \"It's ridiculous! Counselors are not police. We don't have to launch an investigation. We bring whatever information we do have to the police\", she told ''[[Slate (website)|Slate]]''.<ref name=\"Slate piece\" />\n\nIn May 2017, the [[Canadian Mental Health Association]] (CMHA) along with the Centre for Suicide Prevention (CSP) released a statement with similar concerns to the ones raised by NASP. CMHA believed that the series may glamorize suicide, and that some content may lead to distress in viewers, particularly in younger viewers. Furthermore, the portrayal of Hannah's suicide does not follow the media guidelines as set out by the Canadian Association for Suicide Prevention (CASP) and the [[American Association of Suicidology]]. CMHA and CASP did praise the series for raising awareness about \"[[suicide|this preventable health concern]],\" adding that, \"Raising awareness needs to be done in a safe and responsible manner. A large and growing body of Canadian and international research has found clear links between increases in suicide rates and harmful media portrayals of suicide.\" Ways in which the portrayals of suicide may cause harm, according to CMHA and CASP, include the following: \"They may simplify suicide, such as, by suggesting that bullying alone is the cause; they may make suicide seem romantic, such as, by putting it in the context of a Hollywood plot line; they may portray suicide as a logical or viable option; they may display graphic representations of suicide which may be harmful to viewers, especially young ones; and/or they may advance the false notion that suicides are a way to teach others a lesson.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmha.ca/news/cmha-national-statement-responding-netflix-series-13-reasons/ |title=CMHA National Statement Responding to Netflix Series: 13 Reasons Why \u2013 Canadian Mental Health Association |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170504044326/http://www.cmha.ca/news/cmha-national-statement-responding-netflix-series-13-reasons/ |archivedate=May 4, 2017}}</ref><ref>[http://www.nasponline.org/assets/documents/Resources%20and%20Publications/Resources/Crisis/13%20Reasons%20Why%20Guidance_FINAL.pdf National Association of School Psychologists.
