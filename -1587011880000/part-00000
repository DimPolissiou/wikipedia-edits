Nevertheless, prewar Polish-Jewish relations in the town were relatively good. At their most tense, when a Jewish woman was killed in Jedwabne and a Polish peasant in another town was killed a few days later, a rumor began that the Jedwabne Jews had taken revenge. The Jews anticipated a pogrom, but the local priest and rabbi stepped in, addressing the matter together.{{sfn|Gross|2001|p=39}}\n\n[[File:Jewish children and their teacher, Jedwabne, 1938.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Jewish children with their schoolteachers, [[Jedwabne]], 1938]]\nResidents of Jedwabne had memory of the nearby [[Radzi\u0142\u00f3w pogrom#Background|Radzi\u0142\u00f3w pogrom]] of 1933, organized by National Democracy's far-right faction, the [[Camp of Great Poland]] (OWP). The organization referred to the violence as a \"revolution\" against the Polish state, which it saw as a protector of Jews. One Jew was killed by the pogromists and four pogromists were killed by the Polish police; the OWP was then banned by Poland in 1934 for anti-state and racist activities.{{sfn|Bikont|2015|p=9}} According to [[Anna Bikont]], archival documents show Poland's government at this time was hostile to the Polish nationalist movement, because of the latter's attacks on Jews as well as its opposition to the Polish state; the government felt responsible for Jews and tried to protect them (arresting violent nationalists) and it perceived Jews as trying to show loyalty to the Polish state.{{sfn|Bikont|2015|p=31}}\n\n===World War II===\nThe start of [[European Theatre of World War II|World War II in Europe]] began with the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invasion of Poland]] by [[Nazi Germany]] on 1 September 1939.

The same day, two wives of Jewish activists for the Soviets who had evacuated with the Red Army committed suicide with their children.

According to Persak, the Germans probably also allowed the formation of a Polish volunteer [[town guard]].

The witnesses said after the pogrom that they believed the meeting had been held to discuss murdering the town's Jews.

The witnesses were fairly unanimous in assigning the role of pogrom organizers to members of the temporary municipal authorities, with Mayor Karolak at the head. Probably a significant part of the massacre was performed by members of the order service subordinated to them, of which, however, we know very little.{{pb}}\"Far less clear is the role played in Jedwabne by representatives of the German occupation authorities.

According to testimony of the then-messenger at the gendarmerie post, Jerzy Lauda\u0144ski, before the pogrom 'four or five Gestapo men had arrived in a cab, and they began to talk in the town hall.' In colloquial Polish, a 'cab' (''taks\u00f3wka'') denoted a motor car, and 'Gestapo man' referred to any German in a black uniform.

Nevertheless, prewar Polish-Jewish relations in the town were relatively good. At their most tense, when a Jewish woman was killed in Jedwabne and a Polish peasant in another town was killed a few days later, a rumor began that the Jedwabne Jews had taken revenge. The Jews anticipated a pogrom, but the local priest and rabbi stepped in, addressing the matter together.{{sfn|Gross|2001|p=39}}\n\n[[File:Jewish children and their teacher, Jedwabne, 1938.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Jewish children with their schoolteachers, [[Jedwabne]], 1938]]\nResidents of Jedwabne had memory of the nearby [[Radzi\u0142\u00f3w pogrom#Background|Radzi\u0142\u00f3w pogrom]] of 1933, organized by National Democracy's far-right faction, the [[Camp of Great Poland]] (OWP). The organization referred to the violence as a \"revolution\" against the Polish state, which it saw as a protector of Jews. One Jew was killed by the pogromists and four pogromists were killed by the Polish police; the OWP was then banned by Poland in 1934 for anti-state and racist activities.{{sfn|Bikont|2015|p=9}} According to [[Anna Bikont]], archival documents show Poland's government at this time was hostile to the Polish nationalist movement, because of the latter's attacks on Jews as well as its opposition to the Polish state; the government felt responsible for Jews and tried to protect them (arresting violent nationalists) and it perceived Jews as trying to show loyalty to the Polish state.{{sfn|Bikont|2015|p=31}}\n\n===World War II===\nThe start of [[European Theatre of World War II|World War II in Europe]] began with the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invasion of Poland]] by [[Nazi Germany]] on 1 September 1939.

Steinlauf]].{{sfn|Steinlauf|1997|p=31}}\n\n===Tension in Jedwabne===\nThree days into the invasion, six Poles (three ethnic Poles and three Jews) who had collaborated with the Soviets were lynched in Jedwabne; they were reportedly either tortured to death by the locals or beaten by locals then shot by the Germans. The same day, two wives of Jewish activists for the Soviets who had evacuated with the Red Army committed suicide with their children. Other Jews faced robberies and attacks, which the Germans tolerated. Anti-Jewish sentiment was high in Jedwabne and antisemitic violence broke out in pogroms across the newly German-occupied [[Podlasie]] region.{{sfn|Persak|2011|p=411}} In the first days of the occupation of Jedwabne, Persak writes, the Germans set up a Field Gendarmerie (''[[Feldgendarmerie#Operations|Feldgendarmerie]]''), staffed by eight or eleven military police.{{sfn|Persak|2011|pp=411\u2013412}} These established cooperation with a new town council, headed by the brother-in-law of a previous mayor, Marian Karolak. According to Persak, the Germans probably also allowed the formation of a Polish volunteer [[town guard]]. Some of these may have been resistance fighters during the Soviet occupation who later joined the German auxiliary police, because Polish testimonials refer to them as ''szucman'', from ''[[Schutzmannschaft]]''.{{sfn|Persak|2011|p=412}}\n\n===Pogroms===\nPolish villagers participated in massacres of Jews, with varying degrees of German involvement, in 23 localities of the \u0141om\u017ca and Bia\u0142ystok areas of the [[Podlasie]] region after the occupation.

In his view it was a reference to functionaries of the German Security Police or Security Service (''[[Sicherheitspolizei]]'' or ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'') meeting with town-hall officials. The witnesses said after the pogrom that they believed the meeting had been held to discuss murdering the town's Jews. The mayor, Marian Karolak, is said by witnesses to have played a central role; his brother-in-law ran the town's temporary municipal board.{{sfn|Persak|2011|p=412}}{{efn|Krzysztof Persak (2011): \"The direct perpetrators of those crimes was a sizeable group of residents of Jedwabne and neighboring villages. Those involved in the pogrom took different roles: some killed the victims with their own hands, others supervised the Jews assembled in the market square and escorted them to the execution site in the barn, while some robbed Jewish homes or simply formed a hostile crowd of onlookers. The witnesses were fairly unanimous in assigning the role of pogrom organizers to members of the temporary municipal authorities, with Mayor Karolak at the head. Probably a significant part of the massacre was performed by members of the order service subordinated to them, of which, however, we know very little.{{pb}}\"Far less clear is the role played in Jedwabne by representatives of the German occupation authorities. Undoubtedly, they fully approved and possibly inspired the murder. According to testimony of the then-messenger at the gendarmerie post, Jerzy Lauda\u0144ski, before the pogrom 'four or five Gestapo men had arrived in a cab, and they began to talk in the town hall.' In colloquial Polish, a 'cab' (''taks\u00f3wka'') denoted a motor car, and 'Gestapo man' referred to any German in a black uniform. This reference, no doubt, relates to the meeting of the temporary municipal authorities with\u2014probably\u2014 functionaries of the German Security Police or Security Service (''Sicherheitspolizei'' or ''Sicherheitsdienst''), mentioned by other witnesses as well. Although accounts regarding that issue are all secondhand, their common denominator is that during that 'conference' the decision to murder the Jedwabne Jews was taken.\"{{sfn|Persak|2011|p=412}}}}\n\nThe IPN found that some Jews had been alerted by non-Jewish acquaintances the evening before the pogrom that \"a collective action was being prepared against the Jews\".{{sfn|Findings of Investigation S1/00/Zn, July 2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=AfeGB5yz0ooC&pg=PA133 133]}} According to another account, by historian [[Tomasz Strzembosz]], men from nearby villages arrived by order of the German-appointed Jedwabne mayor Marian Karolak and the German paramilitaries (''[[Feldgendarmerie#Operations|Feldgendarmerie]]'') billeted to the town.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} According to [[Peter Longerich]], \"closer analysis of the crime\" shows that the pogrom was \"engineered by a unit of the German Security Police\", probably a unit from the [[Zichenau]] Gestapo office that had been assigned to ''[[Einsatzgruppe B]]'', and which \"had recruited local Poles as auxiliary 'pogrom police'\".{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=196}} Several witnesses reported seeing German photographers take pictures of the massacre.

The collection features archival documents and essays covering the entire 1939\u20131941 period.

It was well preplanned, initiated by the Germans, and utterly lacked any pogrom-like spontaneity.\" Chodakiewicz good arguments, Wr\u00f3bel wrote, are \"overshadowed by numerous flaws\", lack a sense of proportion, and make selective use of information from sources that support Chodakiewicz's view. According to Wr\u00f3bel, the book has a \"visible political agenda\" and is \"difficult to read, unoriginal, irritating, and unconvincing\".{{sfn|Wr\u00f3bel|2006b}}\n\nReviewing the book for ''[[History (journal)|History]]'', [[Peter D. Stachura]] agreed with Chodakiewicz that the pogrom had been \"conceived, supervised and executed by German police, with only limited involvement from a very small number of Poles\". He alleged that the Polish collaborators had included \"''Volksdeutsche'' (Polish citizens of German origin) and petty criminals\".{{sfn|Stachura|2007}} In response, [[Joanna Michlic]] and [[Antony Polonsky]] wrote a letter in 2008 to the editor of ''History'', expressing their strong disagreement with the \"content and tone\" of Stachura's review. According to Michlic and Polonsky, Chodakiewicz's and Stachura's conclusions were \"very far from those reached by most historians\", including Poland's [[Institute of National Remembrance]]. They wrote that Chodakiewicz and Stachura \"uphold a view of the Polish past which seeks to return to an untenable vision of modern Poland as solely victim and hero&nbsp;... It is a matter of considerable regret to us that you have allowed your journal to be used to advance this neo-nationalist agenda.\"{{sfn|Michlic|Polonsky|2008}} Stachura took exception to their letter.

The most important recorded episodes are his birth somewhere in [[Boeotia]], his visit to [[Chios]] where he met [[Merope (Oenopion)|Merope]] and after he [[Rape|violated]] her, was blinded by her father, [[Oenopion]], the recovery of his sight at [[Lemnos]], his hunting with [[Artemis]] on [[Crete]], his death by the bow of Artemis or the sting of the giant scorpion which became [[Scorpius|Scorpio]], and his elevation to the heavens.<ref>[[Scholia]] on ''[[Homer]], [[Iliad]]'' 18.486 citing Pherecydes</ref> Most ancient sources omit some of these episodes and several tell only one. This is created very long ago, but the gods are not true.\n\nIn Greek literature he first appears as a great hunter in [[Homer]]'s epic the ''[[Odyssey]]'', where [[Odysseus]] sees his shade in the [[underworld]]. The bare bones of Orion's story are told by the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] and Roman collectors of myths, but there is no extant literary version of his adventures comparable, for example, to that of [[Jason]] in [[Apollonius of Rhodes]]' ''[[Argonautica]]'' or [[Euripides]]' ''[[Medea]]''; the entry in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'' for May 11 is a poem on the birth of Orion, but that is one version of a single story. The surviving fragments of legend have provided a fertile field for speculation about Greek prehistory and myth. This proves many theories.\n\nOrion served several roles in [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] culture. The story of the adventures of Orion, the hunter, is the one for which there is the most evidence (and even for that, not very much); he is also the personification of the constellation of the same name; he was venerated as a [[Greek hero cult|hero]], in the Greek sense, in the region of Boeotia; and there is one [[etiology|etiological]] passage which says that Orion was responsible for the present shape of the [[Strait of Sicily]].\n\n==Legends==\n\n===Homer and Hesiod===\nOrion is mentioned in the oldest surviving works of Greek literature, which probably date back to the 7th or 8th&nbsp;century&nbsp; BC, but which are the products of an oral tradition with origins several centuries earlier. In [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' Orion is described as a constellation, and the star [[Sirius]] is mentioned as his dog.<ref>Il.[https://archive.today/20120712215800/http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hom.+Il.+18.388 \u03a3 486\u2013489], on the shield of Achilles, and [https://archive.today/20120629052324/http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hom.+Il.+22.1 \u03a7 29], respectively.</ref> In the ''[[Odyssey]]'', Orion is essentially the godfather of hunting, Odysseus sees him hunting in the underworld with a bronze club, a great slayer of animals; In some legends Orion claims to be able to hunt any animal in existence. He is also mentioned as a constellation, as the lover of the [[Eos|Goddess Dawn]], as slain by [[Artemis]], and as the most handsome of the earthborn.<ref>\u03bb 572\u2013577 (as a hunter); \u03b5 273\u2013275, as a constellation (= \u03a3 487\u2013489); \u03b5 121\u2013124; \u03bb 572\u201377; \u03bb 309\u2013310; Rose (''A Handbook,'' p.117) notes that Homer never identifies the hunter and the constellation, and suggests that they were not originally the same.</ref> In the ''[[Works and Days]]'' of [[Hesiod]], Orion is also a constellation, one whose rising and setting with the sun is used to reckon the year.<ref>ll. 598, 623</ref>\n<span id=\"Seiter painting\"></span> \n[[Image:Diane aupr\u00e8s du cadavre d'Orion.jpg|thumb|[[Daniel Seiter]]'s 1685 painting of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] over Orion's corpse, before he is placed in the heavens]]\nThe legend of Orion was first told in full in a lost work by Hesiod, probably the ''[[Astronomia]]'' (simple references to \u2018''Hesiod''\u2019, below will refer to the lost text from ''[[Astronomia]]'', unless otherwise stated). This version is known through the work of [[Eratosthenes]] on the constellations, who gives a fairly long summary of Hesiod's episode on Orion.<ref>[[Eratosthenes]], ''[[Catasterismi]]''; translation in {{gutenberg|no=348|name=Hesiod, the Homeric Hymns, and Homerica by Hesiod|author=Evelyn-White, Hugh G.|year=1914}} Whether these works are actually by Hesiod and Eratosthenes themselves is doubtful; pseudo-Eratosthenes does not specify the work of Hesiod he is summarizing, but the modern assumption that it is the same work which other authors call the ''Astronomy'' is not particularly controversial. It is certainly neither the ''Theogony'' nor the ''Works and Days''.</ref> According to this version, Orion was likely the son of the sea-god [[Poseidon]] and Euryale,<ref>The summary of Hesiod simply says Euryale, but there is no reason to conflate her with [[Euryale (Gorgon)|Euryale]] the Gorgon, or to Euryale the Amazon of [[Gaius Valerius Flaccus]]; other ancient sources say explicitly Euryale, daughter of Minos.</ref> daughter of [[Minos]], King of Crete. Orion could walk on the waves because of his father; he walked to the island of [[Chios]] where he got drunk and attacked [[Merope (Oenopion)|Merope]],<ref>Apparently unrelated to the Merope who was one of the [[Pleiades (mythology)|Pleiades]].</ref> daughter of [[Oenopion]], the ruler there. In vengeance, Oenopion blinded Orion and drove him away. Orion stumbled to [[Lemnos]] where [[Hephaestus]] \u2014 the smith-god \u2014 had his forge. Hephaestus told his servant, [[Cedalion]], to guide Orion to the uttermost East where [[Helios]], the Sun, healed him; Orion carried Cedalion around on his shoulders. Orion returned to Chios to punish Oenopion, but the king hid away underground and escaped Orion's wrath. Orion's next journey took him to [[Crete]] where he hunted with the goddess [[Artemis]] and her mother [[Leto]], and in the course of the hunt, threatened to kill every beast on Earth. Mother [[Gaia (mythology)|Earth]] ([[Apollo]] in some versions, disapproving of his sister's relationship with a male) objected and sent a giant scorpion to kill Orion. The creature succeeded, and after his death, the goddesses asked [[Zeus]] to place Orion among the constellations. Zeus consented and, as a memorial to the hero's death, added the [[Scorpius|Scorpion]] to the heavens as well.<ref>[[Scorpion]] is here a type of creature, Greek ''\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c1\u03c0\u03af\u03bf\u03c2,'' not a proper name. The constellation is called [[Scorpius (constellation)|Scorpius]] in astronomy; colloquially, [[Scorpio (astrology)|Scorpio]], like the related astrological sign \u2014 both are Latin forms of the Greek word. Cicero used ''Nepa,'' the older Latin word for \"scorpion.\" See Kubiak's paper in the bibliography.</ref>\n\n===Other sources===\nAlthough Orion has a few lines in both Homeric poems and in the ''Works and Days'', most of the stories about him are recorded in incidental allusions and in fairly obscure later writings. No great poet standardized the legend.<ref>Rose, ''A Handbook'', p.116\u2013117</ref> The ancient sources for Orion's legend are mostly notes in the margins of ancient poets ([[scholia]]) or compilations by later scholars, the equivalent of modern reference works or encyclopedias; even the legend from Hesiod's ''Astronomy'' survives only in one such compilation. In several cases, including the summary of the ''Astronomy'', although the surviving work bears the name of a famous scholar, such as [[Apollodorus of Athens]], [[Eratosthenes]], or [[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], what survives is either an ancient forgery or an abridgement of the original compilation by a later writer of dubious competence; editors of these texts suggest that they may have borne the names of great scholars because they were abridgments, or even pupil's notes, based on the works of the scholars.<ref>''Oxford Classical Dictionary''. Under \"Apollodorus of Athens (6)\" it describes the [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]] as an uncritical forgery some centuries later than Apollodorus; it distinguishes \"Hyginus (4)\", the author of the ''Fabulae'' and ''Astronomy'', from \"Hyginus (1)\", (C. Julius) adding of the former that the \"absurdities\" of this \"abbreviated\" compilation are \"partly due to its compiler's ignorance of Greek.\" Under \"Eratosthenes\", it dismisses the surviving ''Catasterismi'' as pseudo-Eratosthenic. See Frazer's Loeb Apollodorus, and Condos's translation of the other two (as ''Star myths of the Greeks and Romans'' Phanes, 1997, {{ISBN|1-890482-92-7}}) for the editorial opinions.</ref>\n\nThe margin of the Empress [[Aelia Eudocia|Eudocia]]'s copy of the Iliad has a note summarizing a Hellenistic poet<ref>[[Euphorion of Chalcis]], who wrote in the 2nd century BC. The MS is Allen's [[Venetus A]], scholion to \u03a3 486 Dindorf ''Scholia in Iliadem'' II, 171, l.7\u201320; Erbse's Scholia at line cited (Vol.4).</ref> who tells a different story of Orion's birth.

A bull would be an appropriate sacrifice to male gods.</ref> When they offer him a favor, he asks for the birth of sons. The gods take the bull's hide and [[urinate]] into it<ref>Both are represented by the same Greek participle, ''ourion'', thus explaining Orion's name; the version that has come down to us as [Pseudo]-[[Palaephatus]], ''On Unbelievable Tales'' \u00a751 uses ''apespermenan'' (\"to spread seed\") and ''our\u0113sai'' (the infinitive of ''ourion'') in different sentences. The Latin translations by Hyginus are ambiguous. Ejaculation of semen is the more obvious interpretation here, and Kerenyi assumes it; but [[John Peter Oleson]] argued, in the note to p.28 of [https://www.jstor.org/stable/294109 A Possible Physiological Basis for the Term urinator, \"diver\"] (''The American Journal of Philology, Vol. 97'', No. 1.

Here Orion is described as earthborn and enormous in stature. This version also mentions Poseidon and Euryale as his parents. It adds a first marriage to [[Side (mythology)|Side]] before his marriage to Merope. All that is known about Side is that [[Hera]] threw her into [[Hades]] for rivalling her in beauty. It also gives a different version of Orion's death than the ''[[Iliad]]'': [[Eos]], the Dawn, fell in love with Orion and took him to [[Delos]] where Artemis killed him.<ref>The ''[[Bibliotheke]]'' [https://archive.today/20120905022144/http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Apollod.+1.4.3 1.4.3\u20131.4.5].

Paragraphing according to [[Ghislane Vir\u00e9]]'s 1992 [[Teubner]] edition. Modern scholarship holds that these are not the original work of Hyginus either, but latter condensations: a teacher's, possibly a student's, notes.</ref> It begins with the oxhide story of Orion's birth, which this source ascribes to [[Callimachus]] and Aristomachus, and sets the location at [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] or Chios.<ref>Aristomachus of Soli wrote on bee-keeping (''Oxford Classical Dictionary'': \"Bee-keeping\").</ref> Hyginus has two versions. In one of them he omits Poseidon;<ref>In the [http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusAstronomica2.html#34 ''Astronomia;''] the [http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae4.html#195 ''Fabulae''] have Poseidon.</ref> a modern critic suggests this is the original version.<ref>Fontenrose, ''Orion''.</ref>\n\nThe same source tells two stories of the death of Orion. The first says that because of his \"living joined in too great a friendship\" with [[Oenopion]], he boasted to [[Artemis]] and [[Leto]] that he could kill anything which came from Earth. Gaia (the personification of Earth in Greek mythology) objected and created the Scorpion.<ref>''prope nimia conjunctum amicitia vixisse''. Hyginus, ''Ast.'', 2.26</ref> In the second story, Apollo, being jealous of Orion's love for Artemis because he charmed Artemis with his Bow and arrow skills, with the blessing of Artemis, Orion has archery skills unparalleled to any other archers in history; which might even have made her willing to marry him, arranged for her to kill him. Seeing Orion swimming in the ocean, a long way off, he said that Artemis could not possibly hit that black thing in the water. Feeling challenged, she sent an arrow right through it and killed Orion; when his body washed up on shore, she wept copiously, and decided to place Orion among the stars.<ref>Hyginus, ''Ast.'' 2.34, quoting Istrus. Robert Graves divides  ''[[The Greek Myths]]'' into his own retelling of the myths and his explanations; in retelling Hyginus, Graves adds that Apollo challenged Artemis to hit \"that rascal [[Candaon]]\"; this is for narrative smoothness. It is not in his source.</ref> He connects Orion with several constellations, not just Scorpio. Orion chased [[Pleione (mythology)|Pleione]], the mother of the [[Pleiades (mythology)|Pleiades]], for seven years, until Zeus intervened and raised all of them to the stars.<ref>2.21</ref> In ''Works and Days'', Orion chases the Pleiades themselves. [[Canis Minor]] and [[Canis Major]] are his dogs, the one in front is called [[Procyon]]. They chase [[Lepus (constellation)|Lepus]], the hare, although Hyginus says some critics thought this too base a prey for the noble Orion and have him pursuing [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]], the bull, instead.<ref>Hyginus, ''Astr.'' 2.33, 35\u201336; which also present these as the dogs of [[Procris]].</ref> A Renaissance mythographer adds other names for Orion's dogs: Leucomelaena, [[Maera (hound)|Maera]], Dromis, Cisseta, Lampuris, [[Lycoctonus]], Ptoophagus, Arctophonus.<ref>Natalis Comes, ''Mythologiae'', translated by Mulryan and Brown, p. 457/II 752. Whatever his interpretations, he is usually scrupulous about citing his sources, which he copies with \"stenographic accuracy\". Here, however, he says merely ''commemorantur'', ''adderunt'', which have the implied subject \"ancient writers\". The dog's names mean \"White-black\" (or perhaps \"gray\"), \"Sparkler\", \"Runner\", \"Yearned-for\", \"Shining\", \"Wolf-slayer\", \"Fear-eater\"(?) and \"Bear-slayer\".</ref>\n\n===Variants===\nThere are numerous variants in other authors. Most of these are incidental references in poems and [[scholia]]sts. The Roman poet [[Virgil]] shows Orion as a giant wading through the [[Aegean Sea]] with the waves breaking against his shoulders; rather than, as the mythographers have it, walking on the water.<ref>''[[Aeneis]]'' [https://archive.today/20120712032039/http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Verg.+A.+10.755 10, 763\u2013767]</ref> There are several references to Hyrieus as the father of Orion that connect him to various places in [[Boeotia]], including [[Hyria (Boeotia)|Hyria]]; this may well be the original story (although not the first attested), since Hyrieus is presumably the [[:wikt:eponym|eponym]] of Hyria. He is also called Oeneus, although he is not the [[Oeneus|Calydonian Oeneus]].<ref>Pack, p.200; giving Hyginus's etymology for Urion, but describing it as \"fantastic\".

In the second variant, Orion died of the Scorpion's sting as he does in Hesiod. Although Orion does not defeat the Scorpion in any version, several variants have it die from its wounds. Artemis is given various motives. One is that Orion boasted of his beast-killing and challenged her to a contest with the [[discus]]. Another is that he assaulted either Artemis herself or [[Nymphai Hyperboreioi|Opis]], a [[Hyperborean]] maiden in her band of huntresses.<ref>Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheke'', and Frazer's notes. Artemis is called Opis in [[Callimachus]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Call.+H.+3+hymns+3.170 Hymn 3.204''f''] and elsewhere (Fontenrose, ''Orion'', p. 13).</ref> [[Aratus]]'s brief description, in his ''Astronomy'', conflates the elements of the myth: according to Aratus, Orion attacks Artemis while hunting on ''Chios'', and the Scorpion kills him there.<ref>Aratus, ''Phaenomena'' I, 634\u2013646. quoted in Kubiak, p. 14.</ref> [[Nicander]], in his ''Theriaca'', has the scorpion of ordinary size and hiding under a small (''oligos'') stone.<ref>Nicander, ''Theriaca'', lines 15\u201320.</ref> Most versions of the story that continue after Orion's death tell of the gods raising Orion and the Scorpion to the stars, but even here a variant exists: Ancient poets differed greatly on whom [[Aesculapius]] brought back from the dead;<ref>Zeus slew Aesculapius for his presumption in raising the dead, so there was only one subject.</ref> the Argive epic poet [[Telesarchus]] is quoted as saying in a scholion that Aesculapius resurrected Orion.<ref>[[Pherecydes of Athens]] ''Testimonianze i frammenti'' ed. Paola Dolcetti 2004; frag. 160 = 35a ''Frag. Hist. Gr'' = 35 Fowler.

One source refers to Merope as Oenopion's wife, not his daughter. Another refers to Merope as the daughter of Minos and not of Oenopion.<ref>Kerenyi, ''Gods of the Greeks'', pp. 201\u2013204; for Merope as the wife of Oenopion, he cites the scholiast on [[Nicander]], ''Theriaca'' 15.

Unlike most of Parthenius' stories, no source is noted in the MS.</ref> It describes Orion as slaying the wild beasts of Chios and looting the other inhabitants to make a bride-price for Oenopion's daughter, who is called A\u00ebro or Leiro.<ref>Both are emendations of Parthenius's text, which is Haero; ''A\u00ebro'' is from [[Stephen Gaselee (diplomat)|Stephen Gaselee]]'s Loeb edition; ''Leiro'' \"lily\" is from J. L. Lightfoot's 1999 edition of Parthenius, p.495, which records the several emendations suggested by other editors, which include Maero and Merope. \"Leiro\" is supported by a Hellenistic inscription from Chios, which mentions a ''Liro'' as a companion of Oenopion.</ref> Oenopion does not want to marry her to someone like Orion, and eventually Orion, in frustration, breaks into her bedchamber and rapes her. The text implies that Oenopion blinds him on the spot.\n\n[[Image:Orion constellation Hevelius.jpg|thumb|[[Johannes Hevelius]] drew the Orion constellation in ''Uranographia'', his celestial catalogue in 1690]] [[Lucian]] includes a picture with Orion in a rhetorical description of an ideal building, in which Orion is walking into the rising sun with Lemnos nearby, Cedalion on his shoulder.

He ravished her; when his father heard of this, he banished Orion. Orion consulted an oracle, which told him that if he went east, he would regain the glory of kingship.

At the end of this part of the work, he tells the story of Orion and two wonder-stories of his mighty earth-works in [[Sicily]].

He was then \"numbered among the stars of heaven and thus won for himself immortal remembrance\".<ref>[[Diodorus Siculus]] iv 85.5; the intervening passage deals with the opposite aetiology of the Straits of Messina: that Sicily was once connected to the mainland, and the sea (or an earthquake) broke them apart.

Published in 1617.]]\nMythographers have discussed Orion at least since the [[Renaissance]] of classical learning; the Renaissance interpretations were allegorical. In the 14th century, Boccaccio interpreted the oxhide story as representing human conception; the hide is the womb, Neptune the moisture of semen, Jupiter its heat, and Mercury the female coldness; he also explained Orion's death at the hands of the moon-goddess as the Moon producing winter storms.<ref>Boccaccio, ''Genealogie'', Book 11 \u00a719, pp. 558 l. 30 to p.559 l.11.</ref> The 16th-century Italian mythographer [[Natalis Comes]] interpreted the whole story of Orion as an [[allegory]] of the evolution of a storm cloud: Begotten by air (Zeus), water (Poseidon), and the sun (Apollo), a storm cloud is diffused (Chios, which Comes derives from \u03c7\u03ad\u03c9, \"pour out\"), rises though the upper air ([[Air (classical element)|A\u00ebrope]], as Comes spells Merope), chills (is blinded), and is turned into rain by the moon (Artemis). He also explains how Orion walked on the sea: \"Since the subtler part of the water which is rarefied rests on the surface, it is said that Orion learned from his father how to walk on water.\"<ref>Gombrich (1994); Natalis Comes, ''Mythologiae'', translated by Mulryan and Brown, 459/II 754\u2013755.</ref> Similarly, Orion's conception made him a symbol of the [[Filius philosophorum|philosophical child]], an allegory of philosophy springing from multiple sources, in the Renaissance as in alchemical works, with some variations. The 16th-century German alchemist [[Michael Maier]] lists the fathers as Apollo, Vulcan and Mercury,<ref>\nMaier, Michael (1617).

There are some points of general agreement between them: for example, that the attack on Opis is an attack on Artemis, for Opis is one of the names of Artemis.<ref>Fontenrose, ''Orion'', p.13 and note, but also Graves, Kerenyi and Rose.</ref>\n\nThere was a movement in the late nineteenth century to interpret all the Boeotian heroes as merely personifications of the constellations;<ref>Farnell (''Greek Hero Cults'' p. 21) doubts it, even of Orion.</ref> there has since come to be wide agreement that the myth of Orion existed before there was a constellation named for him. Homer, for example, mentions Orion, the Hunter, and Orion, the constellation, but never confuses the two.<ref>Fontenrose, ''Orion'', p. 27; Graves; Kerenyi, ''Dionysus'', several mentions; the observation on Homer is from Rose, ''A Handbook'', p.117. The early nineteenth-century mythographer [[Karl Otfried M\u00fcller]] considered Orion the \"only purely mythological figure in the heavens\" and had also divided the myths into the original myths of the giant, and the figurative expressions of [[star lore]] after he was later identified with the constellation. [[Karl Otfried M\u00fcller]]: (1844 translation by John Leitch). ''Introduction to a Scientific System of Mythology'', pp. 133\u2013134. Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans.</ref> Once Orion was recognized as a constellation, astronomy in turn affected the myth. The story of Side may well be a piece of astronomical mythology. The Greek word ''side'' means [[pomegranate]], which bears fruit while Orion, the constellation, can be seen in the night sky.<ref>Frazer's notes to Apollodorus, citing a lexicon of 1884. Fontenrose is unconvinced.</ref> Rose suggests she is connected with Sidae in Boeotia, and that the pomegranate, as a sign of the Underworld, is connected with her descent there.<ref>Rose, ''A Handbook'', p. 116</ref>\n\nThe 19th-century German classical scholar [[Erwin Rohde]] viewed Orion as an example of the Greeks erasing the line between the gods and mankind. That is, if Orion was in the heavens, other mortals could hope to be also.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rohde |first=Erwin |year=1925 |title=Psyche: the cult of souls and belief in immortality among the Greeks |location=New York |publisher=Harcourt |oclc=2454243 |page=58}}</ref>\n\nThe Hungarian mythographer [[Karl Ker\u00e9nyi]], one of the founders of the modern study of Greek mythology, wrote about Orion in ''Gods of the Greeks'' (1951). Ker\u00e9nyi portrays Orion as a giant of [[Titan (mythology)|Titanic]] vigor and criminality, born outside his mother as were [[Tityos]] or [[Dionysus]].<ref>Ker\u00e9nyi believes the story of Hyrieus to be original, and that the pun on Orion/''ourion'' was made for the myth, rather than the other way around.</ref> Ker\u00e9nyi places great stress on the variant in which Merope is the wife of Oenopion. He sees this as the remnant of a lost form of the myth in which Merope was Orion's mother (converted by later generations to his stepmother and then to the present forms). Orion's blinding is therefore parallel to that of [[Aegypius (mythology)|Aegypius]] and [[Oedipus]].\n\nIn ''Dionysus'' (1976), Ker\u00e9nyi portrays Orion as a shamanic hunting hero, surviving from Minoan times (hence his association with Crete). Ker\u00e9nyi derives Hyrieus (and Hyria) from the Cretan dialect word ''\u1f55\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd - hyron'', meaning \"beehive\", which survives only in ancient dictionaries. From this association he turns Orion into a representative of the old [[mead]]-drinking cultures, overcome by the wine masters Oenopion and Oeneus. (The Greek for \"wine\" is ''oinos''.) Fontenrose cites a source stating that Oenopion taught the Chians how to make wine before anybody else knew how.<ref>Fontenrose, ''Orion'', p. 9, citing [[Theopompus]]. 264 GH.</ref>\n\n[[Joseph Fontenrose]] wrote ''Orion : the Myth of the Hunter and the Huntress'' (1981) to show Orion as the [[type specimen]] of a variety of grotesque hero. Fontenrose views him as similar to [[C\u00fachulainn]], that is, stronger, larger, and more potent than ordinary men and the violent lover of the Divine Huntress; other heroes of the same type are [[Actaeon]], [[Leucippus (mythology)|Leucippus]] (son of [[Oenomaus]]), [[Cephalus]], [[Teiresias]], and [[Zeus]] as the lover of [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]]. Fontenrose also sees Eastern parallels in the figures of [[Aqhat]], [[Attis]], [[Dumuzid the Shepherd|Dumuzi]], [[Gilgamesh]], [[Dushyanta]], and [[Prajapati]] (as pursuer of [[Ushas]]).\n\nIn ''The Greek Myths'' (1955), [[Robert Graves]] views Oenopion as his perennial [[Year-King]], at the stage where the king pretends to die at the end of his term and appoints a substitute, in this case Orion, who actually dies in his place. His blindness is iconotropy from a picture of Odysseus blinding the [[Cyclopes|Cyclops]], mixed with a purely Hellenic solar legend: the Sun-hero is captured and blinded by his enemies at dusk, but escapes and regains his sight at dawn, when all beasts flee him. Graves sees the rest of the myth as a syncretism of diverse stories. These include Gilgamesh and the Scorpion-Men, Set becoming a scorpion to kill Horus and the story of [[Aqhat]] and Yatpan from [[Ras Shamra]], as well as a conjectural story of how the priestesses of Artemis Opis killed a visitor to their island of Ortygia. He compares Orion's birth from the bull's hide to a West African rainmaking charm and claims that the son of Poseidon should be a rainmaker.<ref>Graves, ''Greek Myths'', \u00a741, 1\u20135</ref>\n\n==Cultural references==\nThe ancient Greek and Roman sources which tell more about Orion than his being a gigantic huntsman are mostly both dry and obscure, but poets do write of him: The brief passages in Aratus and Virgil are mentioned [[#Variants|above]]. [[Pindar]] celebrates the [[Pankration|pancratist]] Melissus of Thebes \"who was not granted the build of an Orion\", but whose strength was still great.<ref>''Isthmian Odes'' 4.49; 3.67 for those who combine this Ode with the preceding one, also on Melissus. Quote from Race's Loeb translation.</ref>\n\n[[Cicero]] translated Aratus in his youth; he made the Orion episode half again longer than it was in the Greek, adding the traditional Latin [[literary topos|topos]] of madness to Aratus's text. Cicero's ''Aratea'' is one of the oldest Latin poems to come down to us as more than isolated lines; this episode may have established the technique of including [[Epic poetry|epyllia]] in non-epic poems.<ref>Kubiak, who quotes the passage. (33.418\u2013435 Soubiran).</ref>\n\nOrion is used by [[Horace]], who tells of his death at the hands of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]/[[Artemis]],<ref>[https://archive.today/20120717020804/http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hor.+Carm.+3.4.1 ''Carmina'' 3.4.70]. The Roman goddess Diana was identified very early with Artemis, and her name was conventionally used to ''translate'' Artemis into Latin by Horace's time. This system of translation continued to be used, in Latin and English, up through the nineteenth century, and this article will use it for Roman poetry and for the Renaissance.

The most important recorded episodes are his birth somewhere in [[Boeotia]], his visit to [[Chios]] where he met [[Merope (Oenopion)|Merope]] and after he [[Rape|violated]] her, was blinded by her father, [[Oenopion]], the recovery of his sight at [[Lemnos]], his hunting with [[Artemis]] on [[Crete]], his death by the bow of Artemis or the sting of the giant scorpion which became [[Scorpius|Scorpio]], and his elevation to the heavens.<ref>[[Scholia]] on ''[[Homer]], [[Iliad]]'' 18.486 citing Pherecydes</ref> Most ancient sources omit some of these episodes and several tell only one. This is created very long ago, but the gods are not true.\n\nIn Greek literature he first appears as a great hunter in [[Homer]]'s epic the ''[[Odyssey]]'', where [[Odysseus]] sees his shade in the [[underworld]]. The bare bones of Orion's story are told by the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] and Roman collectors of myths, but there is no extant literary version of his adventures comparable, for example, to that of [[Jason]] in [[Apollonius of Rhodes]]' ''[[Argonautica]]'' or [[Euripides]]' ''[[Medea]]''; the entry in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'' for May 11 is a poem on the birth of Orion, but that is one version of a single story. The surviving fragments of legend have provided a fertile field for speculation about Greek prehistory and myth.\n\nOrion served several roles in [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] culture. The story of the adventures of Orion, the hunter, is the one for which there is the most evidence (and even for that, not very much); he is also the personification of the constellation of the same name; he was venerated as a [[Greek hero cult|hero]], in the Greek sense, in the region of Boeotia; and there is one [[etiology|etiological]] passage which says that Orion was responsible for the present shape of the [[Strait of Sicily]].\n\n==Legends==\n\n===Homer and Hesiod===\nOrion is mentioned in the oldest surviving works of Greek literature, which probably date back to the 7th or 8th&nbsp;century&nbsp; BC, but which are the products of an oral tradition with origins several centuries earlier. In [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' Orion is described as a constellation, and the star [[Sirius]] is mentioned as his dog.<ref>Il.[https://archive.today/20120712215800/http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hom.+Il.+18.388 \u03a3 486\u2013489], on the shield of Achilles, and [https://archive.today/20120629052324/http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hom.+Il.+22.1 \u03a7 29], respectively.</ref> In the ''[[Odyssey]]'', Orion is essentially the godfather of hunting, Odysseus sees him hunting in the underworld with a bronze club, a great slayer of animals; In some legends Orion claims to be able to hunt any animal in existence. He is also mentioned as a constellation, as the lover of the [[Eos|Goddess Dawn]], as slain by [[Artemis]], and as the most handsome of the earthborn.<ref>\u03bb 572\u2013577 (as a hunter); \u03b5 273\u2013275, as a constellation (= \u03a3 487\u2013489); \u03b5 121\u2013124; \u03bb 572\u201377; \u03bb 309\u2013310; Rose (''A Handbook,'' p.117) notes that Homer never identifies the hunter and the constellation, and suggests that they were not originally the same.</ref> In the ''[[Works and Days]]'' of [[Hesiod]], Orion is also a constellation, one whose rising and setting with the sun is used to reckon the year.<ref>ll. 598, 623</ref>\n<span id=\"Seiter painting\"></span> \n[[Image:Diane aupr\u00e8s du cadavre d'Orion.jpg|thumb|[[Daniel Seiter]]'s 1685 painting of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] over Orion's corpse, before he is placed in the heavens]]\nThe legend of Orion was first told in full in a lost work by Hesiod, probably the ''[[Astronomia]]'' (simple references to \u2018''Hesiod''\u2019, below will refer to the lost text from ''[[Astronomia]]'', unless otherwise stated). This version is known through the work of [[Eratosthenes]] on the constellations, who gives a fairly long summary of Hesiod's episode on Orion.<ref>[[Eratosthenes]], ''[[Catasterismi]]''; translation in {{gutenberg|no=348|name=Hesiod, the Homeric Hymns, and Homerica by Hesiod|author=Evelyn-White, Hugh G.|year=1914}} Whether these works are actually by Hesiod and Eratosthenes themselves is doubtful; pseudo-Eratosthenes does not specify the work of Hesiod he is summarizing, but the modern assumption that it is the same work which other authors call the ''Astronomy'' is not particularly controversial. It is certainly neither the ''Theogony'' nor the ''Works and Days''.</ref> According to this version, Orion was likely the son of the sea-god [[Poseidon]] and Euryale,<ref>The summary of Hesiod simply says Euryale, but there is no reason to conflate her with [[Euryale (Gorgon)|Euryale]] the Gorgon, or to Euryale the Amazon of [[Gaius Valerius Flaccus]]; other ancient sources say explicitly Euryale, daughter of Minos.</ref> daughter of [[Minos]], King of Crete. Orion could walk on the waves because of his father; he walked to the island of [[Chios]] where he got drunk and attacked [[Merope (Oenopion)|Merope]],<ref>Apparently unrelated to the Merope who was one of the [[Pleiades (mythology)|Pleiades]].</ref> daughter of [[Oenopion]], the ruler there. In vengeance, Oenopion blinded Orion and drove him away. Orion stumbled to [[Lemnos]] where [[Hephaestus]] \u2014 the smith-god \u2014 had his forge. Hephaestus told his servant, [[Cedalion]], to guide Orion to the uttermost East where [[Helios]], the Sun, healed him; Orion carried Cedalion around on his shoulders. Orion returned to Chios to punish Oenopion, but the king hid away underground and escaped Orion's wrath. Orion's next journey took him to [[Crete]] where he hunted with the goddess [[Artemis]] and her mother [[Leto]], and in the course of the hunt, threatened to kill every beast on Earth. Mother [[Gaia (mythology)|Earth]] ([[Apollo]] in some versions, disapproving of his sister's relationship with a male) objected and sent a giant scorpion to kill Orion. The creature succeeded, and after his death, the goddesses asked [[Zeus]] to place Orion among the constellations. Zeus consented and, as a memorial to the hero's death, added the [[Scorpius|Scorpion]] to the heavens as well.<ref>[[Scorpion]] is here a type of creature, Greek ''\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c1\u03c0\u03af\u03bf\u03c2,'' not a proper name. The constellation is called [[Scorpius (constellation)|Scorpius]] in astronomy; colloquially, [[Scorpio (astrology)|Scorpio]], like the related astrological sign \u2014 both are Latin forms of the Greek word. Cicero used ''Nepa,'' the older Latin word for \"scorpion.\" See Kubiak's paper in the bibliography.</ref>\n\n===Other sources===\nAlthough Orion has a few lines in both Homeric poems and in the ''Works and Days'', most of the stories about him are recorded in incidental allusions and in fairly obscure later writings. No great poet standardized the legend.<ref>Rose, ''A Handbook'', p.116\u2013117</ref> The ancient sources for Orion's legend are mostly notes in the margins of ancient poets ([[scholia]]) or compilations by later scholars, the equivalent of modern reference works or encyclopedias; even the legend from Hesiod's ''Astronomy'' survives only in one such compilation. In several cases, including the summary of the ''Astronomy'', although the surviving work bears the name of a famous scholar, such as [[Apollodorus of Athens]], [[Eratosthenes]], or [[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], what survives is either an ancient forgery or an abridgement of the original compilation by a later writer of dubious competence; editors of these texts suggest that they may have borne the names of great scholars because they were abridgments, or even pupil's notes, based on the works of the scholars.<ref>''Oxford Classical Dictionary''. Under \"Apollodorus of Athens (6)\" it describes the [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]] as an uncritical forgery some centuries later than Apollodorus; it distinguishes \"Hyginus (4)\", the author of the ''Fabulae'' and ''Astronomy'', from \"Hyginus (1)\", (C. Julius) adding of the former that the \"absurdities\" of this \"abbreviated\" compilation are \"partly due to its compiler's ignorance of Greek.\" Under \"Eratosthenes\", it dismisses the surviving ''Catasterismi'' as pseudo-Eratosthenic. See Frazer's Loeb Apollodorus, and Condos's translation of the other two (as ''Star myths of the Greeks and Romans'' Phanes, 1997, {{ISBN|1-890482-92-7}}) for the editorial opinions.</ref>\n\nThe margin of the Empress [[Aelia Eudocia|Eudocia]]'s copy of the Iliad has a note summarizing a Hellenistic poet<ref>[[Euphorion of Chalcis]], who wrote in the 2nd century BC. The MS is Allen's [[Venetus A]], scholion to \u03a3 486 Dindorf ''Scholia in Iliadem'' II, 171, l.7\u201320; Erbse's Scholia at line cited (Vol.4).</ref> who tells a different story of Orion's birth. Here the gods [[Zeus]], [[Hermes]], and [[Poseidon]] come to visit [[Hyrieus]] of [[Tanagra]], who roasts a whole bull for them.<ref>The ancient sources for this story all phrase it so that this could be either a bull or a cow; translations vary, although \"bull\" may be more common. A bull would be an appropriate sacrifice to male gods.</ref> When they offer him a favor, he asks for the birth of sons. The gods take the bull's hide and [[urinate]] into it<ref>Both are represented by the same Greek participle, ''ourion'', thus explaining Orion's name; the version that has come down to us as [Pseudo]-[[Palaephatus]], ''On Unbelievable Tales'' \u00a751 uses ''apespermenan'' (\"to spread seed\") and ''our\u0113sai'' (the infinitive of ''ourion'') in different sentences. The Latin translations by Hyginus are ambiguous. Ejaculation of semen is the more obvious interpretation here, and Kerenyi assumes it; but [[John Peter Oleson]] argued, in the note to p.28 of [https://www.jstor.org/stable/294109 A Possible Physiological Basis for the Term urinator, \"diver\"] (''The American Journal of Philology, Vol. 97'', No. 1.

Here Orion is described as earthborn and enormous in stature. This version also mentions Poseidon and Euryale as his parents. It adds a first marriage to [[Side (mythology)|Side]] before his marriage to Merope. All that is known about Side is that [[Hera]] threw her into [[Hades]] for rivalling her in beauty. It also gives a different version of Orion's death than the ''[[Iliad]]'': [[Eos]], the Dawn, fell in love with Orion and took him to [[Delos]] where Artemis killed him.<ref>The ''[[Bibliotheke]]'' [https://archive.today/20120905022144/http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Apollod.+1.4.3 1.4.3\u20131.4.5].

Paragraphing according to [[Ghislane Vir\u00e9]]'s 1992 [[Teubner]] edition. Modern scholarship holds that these are not the original work of Hyginus either, but latter condensations: a teacher's, possibly a student's, notes.</ref> It begins with the oxhide story of Orion's birth, which this source ascribes to [[Callimachus]] and Aristomachus, and sets the location at [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] or Chios.<ref>Aristomachus of Soli wrote on bee-keeping (''Oxford Classical Dictionary'': \"Bee-keeping\").</ref> Hyginus has two versions. In one of them he omits Poseidon;<ref>In the [http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusAstronomica2.html#34 ''Astronomia;''] the [http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae4.html#195 ''Fabulae''] have Poseidon.</ref> a modern critic suggests this is the original version.<ref>Fontenrose, ''Orion''.</ref>\n\nThe same source tells two stories of the death of Orion. The first says that because of his \"living joined in too great a friendship\" with [[Oenopion]], he boasted to [[Artemis]] and [[Leto]] that he could kill anything which came from Earth. Gaia (the personification of Earth in Greek mythology) objected and created the Scorpion.<ref>''prope nimia conjunctum amicitia vixisse''. Hyginus, ''Ast.'', 2.26</ref> In the second story, Apollo, being jealous of Orion's love for Artemis because he charmed Artemis with his Bow and arrow skills, with the blessing of Artemis, Orion has archery skills unparalleled to any other archers in history; which might even have made her willing to marry him, arranged for her to kill him. Seeing Orion swimming in the ocean, a long way off, he said that Artemis could not possibly hit that black thing in the water. Feeling challenged, she sent an arrow right through it and killed Orion; when his body washed up on shore, she wept copiously, and decided to place Orion among the stars.<ref>Hyginus, ''Ast.'' 2.34, quoting Istrus. Robert Graves divides  ''[[The Greek Myths]]'' into his own retelling of the myths and his explanations; in retelling Hyginus, Graves adds that Apollo challenged Artemis to hit \"that rascal [[Candaon]]\"; this is for narrative smoothness. It is not in his source.</ref> He connects Orion with several constellations, not just Scorpio. Orion chased [[Pleione (mythology)|Pleione]], the mother of the [[Pleiades (mythology)|Pleiades]], for seven years, until Zeus intervened and raised all of them to the stars.<ref>2.21</ref> In ''Works and Days'', Orion chases the Pleiades themselves. [[Canis Minor]] and [[Canis Major]] are his dogs, the one in front is called [[Procyon]]. They chase [[Lepus (constellation)|Lepus]], the hare, although Hyginus says some critics thought this too base a prey for the noble Orion and have him pursuing [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]], the bull, instead.<ref>Hyginus, ''Astr.'' 2.33, 35\u201336; which also present these as the dogs of [[Procris]].</ref> A Renaissance mythographer adds other names for Orion's dogs: Leucomelaena, [[Maera (hound)|Maera]], Dromis, Cisseta, Lampuris, [[Lycoctonus]], Ptoophagus, Arctophonus.<ref>Natalis Comes, ''Mythologiae'', translated by Mulryan and Brown, p. 457/II 752. Whatever his interpretations, he is usually scrupulous about citing his sources, which he copies with \"stenographic accuracy\". Here, however, he says merely ''commemorantur'', ''adderunt'', which have the implied subject \"ancient writers\". The dog's names mean \"White-black\" (or perhaps \"gray\"), \"Sparkler\", \"Runner\", \"Yearned-for\", \"Shining\", \"Wolf-slayer\", \"Fear-eater\"(?) and \"Bear-slayer\".</ref>\n\n===Variants===\nThere are numerous variants in other authors. Most of these are incidental references in poems and [[scholia]]sts. The Roman poet [[Virgil]] shows Orion as a giant wading through the [[Aegean Sea]] with the waves breaking against his shoulders; rather than, as the mythographers have it, walking on the water.<ref>''[[Aeneis]]'' [https://archive.today/20120712032039/http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Verg.+A.+10.755 10, 763\u2013767]</ref> There are several references to Hyrieus as the father of Orion that connect him to various places in [[Boeotia]], including [[Hyria (Boeotia)|Hyria]]; this may well be the original story (although not the first attested), since Hyrieus is presumably the [[:wikt:eponym|eponym]] of Hyria. He is also called Oeneus, although he is not the [[Oeneus|Calydonian Oeneus]].<ref>Pack, p.200; giving Hyginus's etymology for Urion, but describing it as \"fantastic\".

In the second variant, Orion died of the Scorpion's sting as he does in Hesiod. Although Orion does not defeat the Scorpion in any version, several variants have it die from its wounds. Artemis is given various motives. One is that Orion boasted of his beast-killing and challenged her to a contest with the [[discus]]. Another is that he assaulted either Artemis herself or [[Nymphai Hyperboreioi|Opis]], a [[Hyperborean]] maiden in her band of huntresses.<ref>Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheke'', and Frazer's notes.

Published in 1617.]]\nMythographers have discussed Orion at least since the [[Renaissance]] of classical learning; the Renaissance interpretations were allegorical. In the 14th century, Boccaccio interpreted the oxhide story as representing human conception; the hide is the womb, Neptune the moisture of semen, Jupiter its heat, and Mercury the female coldness; he also explained Orion's death at the hands of the moon-goddess as the Moon producing winter storms.<ref>Boccaccio, ''Genealogie'', Book 11 \u00a719, pp. 558 l. 30 to p.559 l.11.</ref> The 16th-century Italian mythographer [[Natalis Comes]] interpreted the whole story of Orion as an [[allegory]] of the evolution of a storm cloud: Begotten by air (Zeus), water (Poseidon), and the sun (Apollo), a storm cloud is diffused (Chios, which Comes derives from \u03c7\u03ad\u03c9, \"pour out\"), rises though the upper air ([[Air (classical element)|A\u00ebrope]], as Comes spells Merope), chills (is blinded), and is turned into rain by the moon (Artemis). He also explains how Orion walked on the sea: \"Since the subtler part of the water which is rarefied rests on the surface, it is said that Orion learned from his father how to walk on water.\"<ref>Gombrich (1994); Natalis Comes, ''Mythologiae'', translated by Mulryan and Brown, 459/II 754\u2013755.</ref> Similarly, Orion's conception made him a symbol of the [[Filius philosophorum|philosophical child]], an allegory of philosophy springing from multiple sources, in the Renaissance as in alchemical works, with some variations. The 16th-century German alchemist [[Michael Maier]] lists the fathers as Apollo, Vulcan and Mercury,<ref>\nMaier, Michael (1617).

There are some points of general agreement between them: for example, that the attack on Opis is an attack on Artemis, for Opis is one of the names of Artemis.<ref>Fontenrose, ''Orion'', p.13 and note, but also Graves, Kerenyi and Rose.</ref>\n\nThere was a movement in the late nineteenth century to interpret all the Boeotian heroes as merely personifications of the constellations;<ref>Farnell (''Greek Hero Cults'' p. 21) doubts it, even of Orion.</ref> there has since come to be wide agreement that the myth of Orion existed before there was a constellation named for him. Homer, for example, mentions Orion, the Hunter, and Orion, the constellation, but never confuses the two.<ref>Fontenrose, ''Orion'', p. 27; Graves; Kerenyi, ''Dionysus'', several mentions; the observation on Homer is from Rose, ''A Handbook'', p.117. The early nineteenth-century mythographer [[Karl Otfried M\u00fcller]] considered Orion the \"only purely mythological figure in the heavens\" and had also divided the myths into the original myths of the giant, and the figurative expressions of [[star lore]] after he was later identified with the constellation. [[Karl Otfried M\u00fcller]]: (1844 translation by John Leitch). ''Introduction to a Scientific System of Mythology'', pp. 133\u2013134. Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans.</ref> Once Orion was recognized as a constellation, astronomy in turn affected the myth. The story of Side may well be a piece of astronomical mythology. The Greek word ''side'' means [[pomegranate]], which bears fruit while Orion, the constellation, can be seen in the night sky.<ref>Frazer's notes to Apollodorus, citing a lexicon of 1884. Fontenrose is unconvinced.</ref> Rose suggests she is connected with Sidae in Boeotia, and that the pomegranate, as a sign of the Underworld, is connected with her descent there.<ref>Rose, ''A Handbook'', p. 116</ref>\n\nThe 19th-century German classical scholar [[Erwin Rohde]] viewed Orion as an example of the Greeks erasing the line between the gods and mankind. That is, if Orion was in the heavens, other mortals could hope to be also.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rohde |first=Erwin |year=1925 |title=Psyche: the cult of souls and belief in immortality among the Greeks |location=New York |publisher=Harcourt |oclc=2454243 |page=58}}</ref>\n\nThe Hungarian mythographer [[Karl Ker\u00e9nyi]], one of the founders of the modern study of Greek mythology, wrote about Orion in ''Gods of the Greeks'' (1951). Ker\u00e9nyi portrays Orion as a giant of [[Titan (mythology)|Titanic]] vigor and criminality, born outside his mother as were [[Tityos]] or [[Dionysus]].<ref>Ker\u00e9nyi believes the story of Hyrieus to be original, and that the pun on Orion/''ourion'' was made for the myth, rather than the other way around.</ref> Ker\u00e9nyi places great stress on the variant in which Merope is the wife of Oenopion. He sees this as the remnant of a lost form of the myth in which Merope was Orion's mother (converted by later generations to his stepmother and then to the present forms). Orion's blinding is therefore parallel to that of [[Aegypius (mythology)|Aegypius]] and [[Oedipus]].\n\nIn ''Dionysus'' (1976), Ker\u00e9nyi portrays Orion as a shamanic hunting hero, surviving from Minoan times (hence his association with Crete). Ker\u00e9nyi derives Hyrieus (and Hyria) from the Cretan dialect word ''\u1f55\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd - hyron'', meaning \"beehive\", which survives only in ancient dictionaries. From this association he turns Orion into a representative of the old [[mead]]-drinking cultures, overcome by the wine masters Oenopion and Oeneus. (The Greek for \"wine\" is ''oinos''.) Fontenrose cites a source stating that Oenopion taught the Chians how to make wine before anybody else knew how.<ref>Fontenrose, ''Orion'', p. 9, citing [[Theopompus]]. 264 GH.</ref>\n\n[[Joseph Fontenrose]] wrote ''Orion : the Myth of the Hunter and the Huntress'' (1981) to show Orion as the [[type specimen]] of a variety of grotesque hero. Fontenrose views him as similar to [[C\u00fachulainn]], that is, stronger, larger, and more potent than ordinary men and the violent lover of the Divine Huntress; other heroes of the same type are [[Actaeon]], [[Leucippus (mythology)|Leucippus]] (son of [[Oenomaus]]), [[Cephalus]], [[Teiresias]], and [[Zeus]] as the lover of [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]]. Fontenrose also sees Eastern parallels in the figures of [[Aqhat]], [[Attis]], [[Dumuzid the Shepherd|Dumuzi]], [[Gilgamesh]], [[Dushyanta]], and [[Prajapati]] (as pursuer of [[Ushas]]).\n\nIn ''The Greek Myths'' (1955), [[Robert Graves]] views Oenopion as his perennial [[Year-King]], at the stage where the king pretends to die at the end of his term and appoints a substitute, in this case Orion, who actually dies in his place. His blindness is iconotropy from a picture of Odysseus blinding the [[Cyclopes|Cyclops]], mixed with a purely Hellenic solar legend: the Sun-hero is captured and blinded by his enemies at dusk, but escapes and regains his sight at dawn, when all beasts flee him. Graves sees the rest of the myth as a syncretism of diverse stories. These include Gilgamesh and the Scorpion-Men, Set becoming a scorpion to kill Horus and the story of [[Aqhat]] and Yatpan from [[Ras Shamra]], as well as a conjectural story of how the priestesses of Artemis Opis killed a visitor to their island of Ortygia. He compares Orion's birth from the bull's hide to a West African rainmaking charm and claims that the son of Poseidon should be a rainmaker.<ref>Graves, ''Greek Myths'', \u00a741, 1\u20135</ref>\n\n==Cultural references==\nThe ancient Greek and Roman sources which tell more about Orion than his being a gigantic huntsman are mostly both dry and obscure, but poets do write of him: The brief passages in Aratus and Virgil are mentioned [[#Variants|above]]. [[Pindar]] celebrates the [[Pankration|pancratist]] Melissus of Thebes \"who was not granted the build of an Orion\", but whose strength was still great.<ref>''Isthmian Odes'' 4.49; 3.67 for those who combine this Ode with the preceding one, also on Melissus. Quote from Race's Loeb translation.</ref>\n\n[[Cicero]] translated Aratus in his youth; he made the Orion episode half again longer than it was in the Greek, adding the traditional Latin [[literary topos|topos]] of madness to Aratus's text. Cicero's ''Aratea'' is one of the oldest Latin poems to come down to us as more than isolated lines; this episode may have established the technique of including [[Epic poetry|epyllia]] in non-epic poems.<ref>Kubiak, who quotes the passage. (33.418\u2013435 Soubiran).</ref>\n\nOrion is used by [[Horace]], who tells of his death at the hands of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]/[[Artemis]],<ref>[https://archive.today/20120717020804/http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hor.+Carm.+3.4.1 ''Carmina'' 3.4.70]. The Roman goddess Diana was identified very early with Artemis, and her name was conventionally used to ''translate'' Artemis into Latin by Horace's time. This system of translation continued to be used, in Latin and English, up through the nineteenth century, and this article will use it for Roman poetry and for the Renaissance. Hence Jupiter=Zeus; Neptune= Poseidon, and so forth.

The story is set on the Greek island of [[Delos]] and focuses on Diana's love for Orion as well as on her rival, Aurora.

Orion, sung by a [[castrato]], is in love with Candiope, the daughter of Oenopion, King of Arcadia but his arrogance has offended Diana. Diana's oracle forbids him to marry Candiope and foretells his glory and death. He bids a touching farewell to Candiope and marches off to his destiny. Diana allows him his victory and then kills him, offstage, with her arrow.
