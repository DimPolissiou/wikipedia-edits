It took its name from the road that curved torturously beneath the line just to the south of the halt, the platform of which consisted of simple ground level sleeper-built construction. Being so close to Dyserth, the resident population was limited to a small scattering of cottages, though it was close to Dyserth Hall. The main reason for opening the halt was the hope to attract tourists, who could alight to view waterfalls and the ruins of Dyserth Castle. The line at this point curved around the base of Graig Fawr and passengers could also climb 502 feet to the top for a view over Dyserth and out towards the North Wales coast. The station opened as Alt-y-Graig either in error or as a poor attempt at anglicizing the name. Either way within five months it had been renamed Allt-y-Graig. The opening of the halt had done nothing to stem the hemorrhaging losses that the line was making and less than fifteen months after renaming the halt closed when all passenger services on the branch ceased. It had had an operational life of less than two years. The line remained in use to serve a quarry at Dyserth until that closed in 1973, though the branch continued to see sporadic use until 1980. The trackbed has been converted into a footpath though no trace at all of the halt can be found. The slope up from Allt-y-Graig, which once gave access to the platform, now gives access to the Dyserth Railway Path.\n\n{{Disused Rail Start}}\n{{Rail line\n|previous={{rws|Dyserth}}<br /><small>Line and station closed</small>\n|next={{rws|Meliden}}<br /><small>Line and station closed</small>\n|route=[[London and North Western Railway]]<br /><small>[[Dyserth Branch Line]]</small>\n|col={{LNWR colour}} }}\n{{rail end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{Butt-Stations}}\n*{{Quick-Stations}}\n{{refend}}\n==External links==\n*[http://www.disused-stations.org.uk/a/alt_y_graig_halt/ disused-stations.org.uk]\n\n{{Closed stations Denbighshire}}\n\n[[Category:Disused railway stations in Denbighshire]]\n[[Category:Former London, Midland and Scottish Railway stations]]\n[[Category:Railway stations opened in 1929]]\n[[Category:Railway stations closed in 1930]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2018}}\n{{Use British English|date=March 2018}}\n{{Infobox UK disused station\n| name         = Alt-y-Craig railway station\n| manager      = \n| locale       = \n| borough      = \n| platforms    = 1\n| image_name   = \n| imagesize    = \n| caption      = \n| owner        = \n| coordinates  = {{coord|53.310410|-3.414402|type:railwaystation_region:GB|display=inline,title}}\n| gridref      = SJ058802\n| start        = \n| original     = [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway|LMSR]]\n| pregroup     = \n| postgroup    = \n| years        = 1 Feb 1929\n| events       = Opened as ''Alt-y-Craig''\n| years1       = 8 July 1929\n| events1      = Renamed ''Allt-y-Graig''\n| years2       = 22 Sep 1930\n| events2      = Closed{{sfn|Quick|2009|p=58}}{{sfn|Butt|1995|pp=15 & 16}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.disused-stations.org.uk/a/alt_y_graig_halt/index.shtml |title=The station and line |website=Disused Stations }}</ref>\n| other_name   = Allt-y-Graig\n}}\n{{Dyserth Branch Line|collapse=yes}}\n'''Alt-y-Craig railway station''' (later renamed Allt-y-Graig) was an unstaffed [[Train station#Halt|halt]] on the [[Dyserth branch line]].

On a national level, the standards and numbering for the system are handled by the [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]] (AASHTO), while the highways in Michigan are maintained by the [[Michigan Department of Transportation]] (MDOT).\n\nThe original highways were approved on November 11, 1926, by AASHTO including 14&nbsp;mainline highways. A handful of these original highway designations no longer run within Michigan, and a few numbers have been added since the 1930s. Since 1999, there have been 13 mainline highways, and with the creation of a [[U.S. Route 131 Business (Constantine, Michigan)|business route]] for [[Constantine, Michigan|Constantine]], there are a total of 30 [[special route]]s in the state. Several highways have been converted to [[freeway]]s, some of which are now [[Interstate Highways]] and no longer part of the US Highway System. These freeway conversions started in the 1940s and 1950s and continued through to the turn of the 21st century.\n\n==Description==\nMDOT is the agency responsible for the day-to-day maintenance and operations of the [[Michigan State Trunkline Highway System|State Trunkline Highway System]], which includes the U.S. Highways in Michigan.

On a national level, the standards and numbering for the system are handled by the [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]] (AASHTO), while the highways in Michigan are maintained by the [[Michigan Department of Transportation]] (MDOT).\n\nThe original highways were approved on November 11, 1926, by AASHTO including 14&nbsp;mainline highways. A handful of these original highway designations no longer run within Michigan, and a few numbers have been added since the 1930s. Since 1999, there have been 13 mainline highways, and with the creation of a [[U.S. Route 131 Business (Constantine, Michigan)|business route]] for [[Constantine, Michigan|Constantine]], there are a total of 30 [[special route]]s in the state. Several highways have been converted to [[freeway]]s, some of which are now [[Interstate Highways]] and no longer part of the US Highway System. These freeway conversions started in the 1940s and 1950s and continued through to the turn of the 21st century.\n\n==Description==\nMDOT is the agency responsible for the day-to-day maintenance and operations of the [[Michigan State Trunkline Highway System|State Trunkline Highway System]], which includes the U.S. Highways in Michigan.

The first highway renumbered as an Interstate was [[U.S. Route 24A in Michigan|US&nbsp;24A]] in the southeastern corner of the state, which became part of [[Interstate 75 in Michigan|Interstate 75]] (I-75) in 1959.<ref name=HP1959-10-13/>\n\nMajor numbering changes started in the 1960s as Michigan retired or rerouted its US Highways with the completion of Interstates. [[U.S. Route 12 in Michigan|US&nbsp;12]] replaced US&nbsp;112 in 1962 when the [[Interstate 94 in Michigan|I-94]] designation supplanted most of the original US&nbsp;12.<ref name=changed/> Later that year, [[U.S. Route 16 in Michigan|US&nbsp;16]] was decommissioned in favor of [[Interstate 96|I-96]].<ref name=\"MSHD62/63-K8-M14\" /> This trend continued into the 1970s when [[U.S. Route 25 in Michigan|US&nbsp;25]] was decommissioned as redundant to sections of I-75 and I-94.<ref name=eliminate/>\n\nNot all freeway conversions of existing US Highways resulted in the removal of US Highway numbers. In 1968, the state submitted a request for additional Interstate Highway mileage to the federal government, including a proposal to convert [[U.S. Route 131|US&nbsp;131]].<ref name=argus68>{{cite news |url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tTciAAAAIBAJ&sjid=X6sFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3348,1518663&dq=us+131+freeway&hl=en |title = Highway Additions Requested By State |work = The Owosso Argus-Press |agency = Associated Press |date = November 14, 1968 |page = 7 |access-date = December 5, 2010 |oclc = 9802802 |via = [[Google News]] }}</ref> This specific project was not approved although the state continued its own efforts to convert the highway, including various segments opened in the 1970s<ref name=LDN76>{{cite news |title = News Capsules: Freeway |url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/21840804/news_capsules/ |date = November 2, 1976 |page = 1 |work = Ludington Daily News |access-date = July 13, 2018 |oclc = 27033604 |via = Newspapers.com }} </ref> and 1980s.<ref name=hoogterp>{{cite news |last = Hoogterp |first = Ed |title = US&nbsp;131 Won't Hit the Straits |work = [[The Grand Rapids Press]] |date = January 18, 1981 |pages = 1F, 2F |oclc = 9975013 }}</ref> Other highways converted to freeways included [[U.S. Route 10 in Michigan|US&nbsp;10]], [[U.S. Route 23 in Michigan|US&nbsp;23]], [[U.S. Route 27 in Michigan|US&nbsp;27]], [[U.S. Route 31 in Michigan|US&nbsp;31]] and [[U.S. Route 127 in Michigan|US&nbsp;127]].<ref name=RM13/>\n\nAt the end of the 1970s, MDOT took part in a [[Federal Highway Administration]]-backed initiative called the Positive Guidance Demonstration Project, and the two agencies audited signage practices in the vicinity of the I-96/M-37 and I-296/US&nbsp;131 interchange in [[Walker, Michigan|Walker]], north of [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]].
