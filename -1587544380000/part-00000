Some areas of the conquered world were more affected by Greek influences than others. The term Hellenistic also implies that the Greek populations were of majority in the areas in which they settled, but in many cases, the Greek settlers were actually the minority among the native populations. The Greek population and the native population did not always mix; the Greeks moved and brought their own culture, but interaction did not always occur.\n\n==Sources==\nWhile a few fragments exist, there is no complete surviving historical work which dates to the hundred years following Alexander's death. The works of the major Hellenistic [[historians]] [[Hieronymus of Cardia]] (who worked under Alexander, [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus|Antigonus&nbsp;I]] and other successors), [[Duris of Samos]] and [[Phylarchus]] which were used by surviving [[Primary source|sources]] are all lost.<ref name=\"Walbank\">F.W. Walbank et al. THE CAMBRIDGE ANCIENT HISTORY, SECOND EDITION, VOLUME VII, PART I: The Hellenistic World, p. 1.</ref> The earliest and most credible surviving source for the Hellenistic period is [[Polybius]] of [[Megalopolis, Greece|Megalopolis]] (c. 200\u2013118), a statesman of the [[Achaean League]] until 168&nbsp;BC when he was forced to go to Rome as a hostage.<ref name=\"Walbank\"/> His ''[[The Histories (Polybius)|Histories]]'' eventually grew to a length of forty books, covering the years 220 to 167&nbsp;BC.\n\nThe most important source after Polybius is [[Diodorus Siculus]] who wrote his ''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'' between 60 and 30&nbsp;BC and reproduced some important earlier sources such as Hieronymus, but his account of the Hellenistic period breaks off after the [[battle of Ipsus]] (301&nbsp;BC). Another important source, [[Plutarch]]'s ({{circa|AD&nbsp;50|120}}) ''[[Parallel Lives]]'' although more preoccupied with issues of personal character and morality, outlines the history of important Hellenistic figures. [[Appian]] of Alexandria (late 1st century AD\u2013before 165) wrote a history of the [[Roman empire]] that includes information of some Hellenistic kingdoms.\n\nOther sources include [[Justin (historian)|Justin]]'s (2nd century AD) [[epitome]] of [[Pompeius Trogus]]' ''Historiae Philipicae'' and a summary of [[Arrian]]'s ''Events after Alexander'', by [[Photios&nbsp;I of Constantinople]].

In the field of philosophy, [[Diogenes La\u00ebrtius]]' ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]'' is the main source; works such as [[Cicero]]'s ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'' also provide some further detail of philosophical schools in the Hellenistic period.\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|Philip II of Macedon|Alexander the Great|Wars of Alexander the Great}}\n[[File:Napoli BW 2013-05-16 16-24-01.jpg|left|thumb|[[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] fighting the Persian king [[Darius III of Persia|Darius&nbsp;III]]. From the [[Alexander Mosaic]], [[Naples National Archaeological Museum]].]]\nAncient Greece had traditionally been a fractious collection of fiercely independent city-states. After the [[Peloponnesian War]] (431&ndash;404&nbsp;BC), Greece had fallen under a [[Spartan hegemony]], in which [[Sparta]] was pre-eminent but not all-powerful. Spartan hegemony was succeeded by a [[Thebes (Greece)|Theban]] [[Theban hegemony|hegemony]] after the [[Battle of Leuctra]] (371&nbsp;BC), but after the [[Battle of Mantinea (362&nbsp;BC)]], all of Greece was so weakened that no one state could claim pre-eminence. It was against this backdrop that the ascendancy of [[Macedon]] began, under king [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip&nbsp;II]]. Macedon was located at the periphery of the Greek world, and although its royal family claimed Greek descent, the Macedonians themselves were looked down upon as semi-barbaric by the rest of the Greeks. However, Macedon had a relatively strong and centralized government, and compared to most Greek states, directly controlled a large area.\n\nPhilip&nbsp;II was a strong and expansionist king and he took every opportunity to expand Macedonian territory. In 352&nbsp;BC he annexed [[Thessaly]] and [[Magnesia Prefecture|Magnesia]]. In 338&nbsp;BC, Philip defeated a combined Theban and Athenian army at the [[Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)|Battle of Chaeronea]] after a decade of desultory conflict. In the aftermath, Philip formed the [[League of Corinth]], effectively bringing the majority of Greece under his direct sway. He was elected ''Hegemon'' of the league, and a campaign against the [[Achaemenid Empire]] of Persia was planned. However, while this campaign was in its early stages, he was assassinated.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n[[File:MacedonEmpire.jpg|thumb|right|Alexander's empire at the time of its maximum expansion.]]\nSucceeding his father, Alexander took over the Persian war himself. During a decade of campaigning, Alexander [[Wars of Alexander the Great|conquered the whole Persian Empire]], overthrowing the Persian king [[Darius&nbsp;III]]. The conquered lands included [[Asia Minor]], [[Assyria]], the [[Levant]], [[Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Medes|Media]], [[Persia]], and parts of modern-day [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], and the [[steppes]] of central Asia. The years of constant campaigning had taken their toll however, and Alexander died in 323&nbsp;BC.\n\nAfter his death, the huge territories Alexander had conquered became subject to a strong Greek influence ([[Hellenization]]) for the next two or three centuries, until the rise of [[Roman Empire|Rome]] in the west, and of [[Parthian Empire|Parthia]] in the east. As the Greek and Levantine cultures mingled, the development of a hybrid [[Hellenistic civilisation|Hellenistic culture]] began, and persisted even when isolated from the main centres of Greek culture (for instance, in the [[Greco-Bactrian kingdom]]).\n\nIt can be argued that some of the changes across the [[Macedonian Empire]] after Alexander's conquests and during the rule of the [[Diadochi]] would have occurred without the influence of Greek rule. As mentioned by [[Peter Green (historian)|Peter Green]], numerous factors of conquest have been merged under the term [[Hellenistic Period]]. Specific areas conquered by Alexander's invading army, including Egypt and areas of [[Asia Minor]] and [[Mesopotamia]] \"fell\" willingly to conquest and viewed Alexander as more of a liberator than a conqueror.<ref name=\"autogenerated2007\"/>\n\nIn addition, much of the area conquered would continue to be ruled by the [[Diadochi]], Alexander's generals and successors. Initially the whole empire was divided among them; however, some territories were lost relatively quickly, or only remained nominally under Macedonian rule. After 200 years, only much reduced and rather degenerate states remained,<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> until the conquest of Ptolemaic Egypt by Rome.\n\n==The Diadochi==\n{{Main|Diadochi|Wars of the Diadochi|Partition of Babylon}}\n{{further information|History of Macedonia (ancient kingdom)}}\n[[File:Diadochi satraps babylon.png|thumb|upright=1.15|The distribution of [[satrap]]ies in the [[Macedonian Empire]] after the [[Partition of Babylon|Settlement in Babylon (323&nbsp;BC)]].]]\n\nWhen Alexander the Great died (10 June 323&nbsp;BC), he left behind a huge empire which was composed of many essentially autonomous territories called [[satrap]]s. Without a chosen successor there were immediate disputes among his generals as to who should be king of Macedon. These generals became known as the Diadochi ({{lang-grc-gre|\u0394\u03b9\u03ac\u03b4\u03bf\u03c7\u03bf\u03b9}}, ''Diadokhoi'', meaning \"Successors\").\n\n[[Meleager (general)|Meleager]] and the infantry supported the candidacy of Alexander's half-brother, [[Philip III of Macedon|Philip Arrhidaeus]], while [[Perdiccas]], the leading cavalry commander, supported waiting until the birth of Alexander's child by [[Roxana]]. After the infantry stormed the palace of [[Babylon]], a compromise was arranged &ndash; [[Arrhidaeus]] (as Philip&nbsp;III) should become king, and should rule jointly with Roxana's child, assuming that it was a boy (as it was, becoming [[Alexander IV of Macedon|Alexander&nbsp;IV]]). Perdiccas himself would become regent (''epimeletes'') of the empire, and Meleager his lieutenant. Soon, however, Perdiccas had Meleager and the other infantry leaders murdered, and assumed full control.<ref>Green, Peter (1990); Alexander to Actium, the historical evolution of the Hellenistic age. University of California Press. Pages 7-8.</ref> The generals who had supported Perdiccas were rewarded in the [[partition of Babylon]] by becoming [[satrap]]s of the various parts of the empire, but Perdiccas' position was shaky, because, as [[Arrian]] writes, \"everyone was suspicious of him, and he of them\".<ref>Green (1990), page 9.</ref>\n\nThe first of the [[Diadochi wars]] broke out when [[Perdiccas]] planned to marry Alexander's sister [[Cleopatra of Macedonia|Cleopatra]] and began to question [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus]]' leadership in [[Asia Minor]]. Antigonus fled for Greece, and then, together with [[Antipater]] and [[Craterus]] (the satrap of [[Cilicia]] who had been in Greece fighting the [[Lamian war]]) invaded [[Anatolia]]. The rebels were supported by [[Lysimachus]], the satrap of [[Thrace]] and Ptolemy, the satrap of Egypt. Although [[Eumenes]], satrap of [[Cappadocia]], defeated the rebels in Asia Minor, Perdiccas himself was murdered by his own generals [[Peithon]], [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]], and [[Antigenes (general)|Antigenes]] (possibly with Ptolemy's aid) during his invasion of Egypt ({{circa|21 May}} to 19 June, 320&nbsp;BC).<ref>Green (1990), page 14.</ref> Ptolemy came to terms with Perdiccas's murderers, making Peithon and [[Arrhidaeus]] regents in his place, but soon these came to a new agreement with Antipater at the [[Treaty of Triparadisus]]. Antipater was made regent of the Empire, and the two kings were moved to Macedon. Antigonus remained in charge of Asia Minor, Ptolemy retained Egypt, Lysimachus retained Thrace and [[Seleucus&nbsp;I]] controlled [[Babylon]].\n\nThe second Diadochi war began following the death of [[Antipater]] in 319&nbsp;BC. Passing over his own son, [[Cassander]], Antipater had declared [[Polyperchon]] his successor as [[Regent]]. Cassander rose in revolt against Polyperchon (who was joined by Eumenes) and was supported by Antigonus, Lysimachus and Ptolemy. In 317&nbsp;BC, [[Cassander]] invaded Macedonia, attaining control of Macedon, sentencing [[Olympias]] to death and capturing the boy king [[Alexander IV of Macedon|Alexander&nbsp;IV]], and his mother. In Asia, [[Eumenes]] was betrayed by his own men after years of campaign and was given up to Antigonus who had him executed.\n\n[[File:Diadoch.png|upright=1.15|thumb|right|The Kingdoms of Antigonos and his rivals {{circa|303&nbsp;BC}}.]]\nThe third war of the Diadochi broke out because of the growing power and ambition of Antigonus. He began removing and appointing satraps as if he were king and also raided the royal treasuries in [[Ecbatana]], [[Persepolis]] and [[Susa]], making off with 25,000 [[Talent (measurement)|talents]].<ref>Green (1990), page 21.</ref> Seleucus was forced to flee to Egypt and Antigonus was soon at war with Ptolemy, Lysimachus, and Cassander. He then invaded [[Phoenicia]], laid siege to [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], stormed [[Gaza City|Gaza]] and began building a fleet. Ptolemy invaded Syria and defeated Antigonus' son, [[Demetrius I of Macedon|Demetrius Poliorcetes]], in the [[Battle of Gaza (312 BC)|Battle of Gaza]] of 312&nbsp;BC which allowed [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]] to secure control of [[Babylonia]], and the eastern satrapies. In 310&nbsp;BC, Cassander had young King Alexander&nbsp;IV and his mother [[Roxana]] murdered, ending the [[Argead Dynasty]] which had ruled Macedon for several centuries.\n\nAntigonus then sent his son [[Demetrius I Poliorcetes|Demetrius]] to regain control of Greece. In 307&nbsp;BC he took Athens, expelling [[Demetrius of Phaleron]], Cassander's governor, and proclaiming the city free again. Demetrius now turned his attention to Ptolemy, defeating his fleet at the [[Battle of Salamis in Cyprus (306 BC)|Battle of Salamis]] and taking control of Cyprus. In the aftermath of this victory, Antigonus took the title of king (''[[basileus]]'') and bestowed it on his son [[Demetrius Poliorcetes]], the rest of the Diadochi soon followed suit.<ref>Green (1990), page 30\u201331.</ref> Demetrius continued his campaigns by [[Siege of Rhodes (305 BC)|laying siege to Rhodes]] and conquering most of Greece in 302&nbsp;BC, creating a league against Cassander's Macedon.\n\nThe decisive engagement of the war came when Lysimachus invaded and overran much of western Anatolia, but was soon isolated by Antigonus and Demetrius near Ipsus in [[Phrygia]]. Seleucus arrived in time to save Lysimachus and utterly crushed Antigonus at the [[Battle of Ipsus]] in 301&nbsp;BC. Seleucus' war elephants proved decisive, Antigonus was killed, and Demetrius fled back to Greece to attempt to preserve the remnants of his rule there by recapturing a rebellious Athens. Meanwhile, Lysimachus took over [[Ionia]], Seleucus took [[Cilicia]], and Ptolemy captured [[Cyprus]].\n[[File:Diadochen1.png|thumb|right|\n\nKingdoms of the Diadochi after the battle of Ipsus, {{circa|301&nbsp;BC}}.\n{{legend|#787CAD|Kingdom of [[Ptolemy&nbsp;I Soter]]}}\n{{legend|#50A249|Kingdom of [[Cassander]]}}\n{{legend|#C38833|Kingdom of [[Lysimachus]]}}\n{{legend|#C3B933|Kingdom of [[Seleucus I Nicator]]}}\n]]\nAfter Cassander's death in {{circa|298&nbsp;BC}}, however, Demetrius, who still maintained a sizable loyal army and fleet, invaded Macedon, seized the Macedonian throne (294&nbsp;BC) and conquered [[Thessaly]] and most of central Greece (293\u2013291&nbsp;BC).<ref>Green (1990), page 126.</ref> He was defeated in 288&nbsp;BC when [[Lysimachus]] [[Thrace|of Thrace]] and [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]] invaded Macedon on two fronts, and quickly carved up the kingdom for themselves. Demetrius fled to central Greece with his mercenaries and began to build support there and in the northern Peloponnese. He once again laid siege to Athens after they turned on him, but then struck a treaty with the Athenians and Ptolemy, which allowed him to cross over to Asia Minor and wage war on Lysimachus' holdings in [[Ionia]], leaving his son [[Antigonus Gonatas]] in Greece. After initial successes, he was forced to surrender to Seleucus in 285&nbsp;BC and later died in captivity.<ref>Green (1990), page 129.</ref> Lysimachus, who had seized Macedon and Thessaly for himself, was forced into war when Seleucus invaded his territories in Asia Minor and was defeated and killed in 281&nbsp;BC at the [[Battle of Corupedium]], near [[Sardis]]. Seleucus then attempted to conquer Lysimachus' European territories in Thrace and Macedon, but he was assassinated by [[Ptolemy Ceraunus]] (\"the thunderbolt\"), who had taken refuge at the Seleucid court and then had himself acclaimed as king of Macedon. Ptolemy was killed when Macedon was [[Celtic settlement of Eastern Europe#Invasions of Greece|invaded by Gauls in 279&nbsp;BC]]\u2014his head stuck on a spear\u2014and the country fell into anarchy. Antigonus II Gonatas invaded Thrace in the summer of 277 and defeated a large force of 18,000 Gauls. He was quickly hailed as king of Macedon and went on to rule for 35 years.<ref>Green (1990), page 134.</ref>\n\nAt this point the tripartite territorial division of the Hellenistic age was in place, with the main Hellenistic powers being [[Macedon]] under Demetrius's son [[Antigonus&nbsp;II Gonatas]], the [[Ptolemaic kingdom]] under the aged [[Ptolemy&nbsp;I]] and the [[Seleucid empire]] under Seleucus' son [[Antiochus&nbsp;I Soter]].\n\n==Southern Europe==\n\n===Kingdom of Epirus===\n{{Main|Epirus (ancient state)}}\n[[File:Pyrrhus and his Elephants.gif|right|thumb|upright=0.7|Pyrrhus and his elephants.]]\n[[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]] was a [[Doric Greek#Northwest Greek|northwestern Greek]] kingdom in the western [[Balkans]] ruled by the [[Molossian]] [[Aeacidae]] dynasty. Epirus was an ally of [[Macedon]] during the reigns of Philip&nbsp;II and Alexander.\n\nIn 281 [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]] (nicknamed \"the eagle\", ''aetos'') invaded southern Italy to aid the city state of [[History of Taranto|Tarentum]]. Pyrrhus defeated the Romans in the [[Battle of Heraclea]] and at the [[Battle of Asculum]]. Though victorious, he was forced to retreat due to heavy losses, hence the term \"[[Pyrrhic victory]]\". Pyrrhus then turned south and invaded Sicily but was unsuccessful and returned to Italy. After the [[Battle of Beneventum (275 BC)|Battle of Beneventum]] (275&nbsp;BC) Pyrrhus lost all his Italian holdings and left for Epirus.\n\n[[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]] then went to war with Macedonia in 275&nbsp;BC, deposing [[Antigonus&nbsp;II Gonatas]] and briefly ruling over Macedonia and [[Thessaly]] until 272. Afterwards he invaded southern Greece, and was killed in battle against [[Argos]] in 272&nbsp;BC. After the death of Pyrrhus, Epirus remained a minor power. In 233&nbsp;BC the Aeacid royal family was deposed and a federal state was set up called the [[Epirote League]]. The league was conquered by Rome in the [[Third Macedonian War]] (171\u2013168&nbsp;BC).\n\n===Kingdom of Macedon===\n{{Main|Antigonid dynasty}}\n[[File:Philip V of Macedon.jpg|thumb|right|[[Philip V of Macedon|Philip&nbsp;V]], \"''the darling of Hellas''\", wearing the [[Monarchy|royal]] [[diadem (personal wear)|diadem]].]] \n[[Antigonus&nbsp;II]], a student of [[Zeno of Citium]], spent most of his rule defending Macedon against [[Epirus]] and cementing Macedonian power in Greece, first against the Athenians in the [[Chremonidean War]], and then against the [[Achaean League]] of [[Aratus of Sicyon]]. Under the Antigonids, Macedonia was often short on funds, the [[Pangaion Hills|Pangaeum mines]] were no longer as productive as under Philip&nbsp;II, the wealth from Alexander's campaigns had been used up and the countryside pillaged by the [[Celtic settlement of Eastern Europe#Invasions of Greece|Gallic invasion]].<ref>Green (1990), p. 199</ref> A large number of the Macedonian population had also been resettled abroad by Alexander or had chosen to emigrate to the new eastern Greek cities.

Doson led Macedon to victory in the war against the Spartan king [[Cleomenes III]], and occupied [[Sparta]].\n\n[[Philip V of Macedon|Philip&nbsp;V]], who came to power when Doson died in 221&nbsp;BC, was the last Macedonian ruler with both the talent and the opportunity to unite Greece and preserve its independence against the \"cloud rising in the west\": the ever-increasing power of Rome. He was known as \"the darling of Hellas\". Under his auspices the Peace of Naupactus (217&nbsp;BC) brought the latest war between Macedon and the Greek leagues ([[Social War (220\u2013217 BC)|the Social War]] of 220\u2013217&nbsp;BC) to an end, and at this time he controlled all of Greece except Athens, Rhodes and Pergamum.\n\nIn 215&nbsp;BC Philip, with his eye on [[Illyria]], formed an alliance with Rome's enemy [[Hannibal]] of [[Carthage]], which led to Roman alliances with the [[Achaean League]], Rhodes and Pergamum. The [[First Macedonian War]] broke out in 212&nbsp;BC, and ended inconclusively in 205&nbsp;BC. Philip continued to wage war against Pergamum and Rhodes for control of the Aegean (204\u2013200&nbsp;BC) and ignored Roman demands for non-intervention in Greece by invading Attica. In 198&nbsp;BC, during the [[Second Macedonian War]] Philip was decisively defeated at [[Battle of Cynoscephalae|Cynoscephalae]] by the Roman proconsul [[Titus Quinctius Flamininus]] and Macedon lost all its territories in Greece proper. Southern Greece was now thoroughly brought into the Roman [[sphere of influence]], though it retained nominal autonomy. The end of Antigonid Macedon came when Philip&nbsp;V's son, Perseus, was defeated and captured by the Romans in the [[Third Macedonian War]] (171\u2013168&nbsp;BC).\n\n===Rest of Greece===\n{{Main|Hellenistic Greece}}\n[[File:Macedonia and the Aegean World c.200.png|upright=1.15|thumb|Greece and the Aegean World {{circa|200&nbsp;BC}}.]]\nDuring the Hellenistic period the importance of [[Greek peninsula|Greece proper]] within the Greek-speaking world declined sharply. The great centers of [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic culture]] were [[Alexandria]] and [[Antioch]], capitals of [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] and [[Seleucid dynasty|Seleucid Syria]] respectively. The conquests of Alexander greatly widened the horizons of the Greek world, making the endless conflicts between the cities which had marked the 5th and 4th centuries BC seem petty and unimportant. It led to a steady emigration, particularly of the young and ambitious, to the new Greek empires in the east. Many Greeks migrated to [[Alexandria]], [[Antioch]] and the many other new Hellenistic cities founded in Alexander's wake, as far away as modern [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]].\n\nIndependent city states were unable to compete with Hellenistic kingdoms and were usually forced to ally themselves to one of them for defense, giving honors to Hellenistic rulers in return for protection. One example is [[Athens]], which had been decisively defeated by [[Antipater]] in the [[Lamian war]] (323\u2013322&nbsp;BC) and had its port in the [[Piraeus]] garrisoned by Macedonian troops who supported a conservative [[oligarchy]].<ref>Green, Peter; Alexander to Actium, the historical evolution of the Hellenistic age, page 11.</ref> After [[Demetrius Poliorcetes]] captured Athens in 307&nbsp;BC and restored the [[Athenian democracy|democracy]], the Athenians honored him and his father Antigonus by placing gold statues of them on the [[agora]] and granting them the title of king. Athens later allied itself to [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] to throw off Macedonian rule, eventually setting up a religious cult for the Ptolemaic kings and naming one of the city's [[phyle]]s in honour of Ptolemy for his aid against Macedon. In spite of the Ptolemaic monies and fleets backing their endeavors, [[Athens]] and [[Sparta]] were defeated by [[Antigonus&nbsp;II]] during the [[Chremonidean War]] (267\u2013261&nbsp;BC). Athens was then occupied by Macedonian troops, and run by Macedonian officials.\n\n[[Sparta]] remained independent, but it was no longer the leading military power in the [[Peloponnese]]. The Spartan king [[Cleomenes&nbsp;III]] (235\u2013222&nbsp;BC) staged a military coup against the conservative [[ephors]] and pushed through radical social and land reforms in order to increase the size of the shrinking Spartan citizenry able to provide military service and restore Spartan power. Sparta's bid for supremacy was crushed at the [[Battle of Sellasia]] (222&nbsp;BC) by the Achaean league and Macedon, who restored the power of the [[ephors]].\n\nOther [[city states]] formed [[federated states]] in self-defense, such as the [[Aetolian League]] ({{abbr|est.|established}} 370&nbsp;BC), the [[Achaean League]] ({{abbr|est.|established}} 280&nbsp;BC), the [[Boeotian league]], the \"Northern League\" ([[Byzantium]], [[Chalcedon]], [[Heraclea Pontica]] and [[Tium]])<ref>McGing, BC. The Foreign Policy of Mithridates&nbsp;VI Eupator, King of Pontus, P. 17.</ref> and the \"[[Nesiotic League]]\" of the [[Cyclades]]. These [[federations]] involved a central government which controlled [[foreign policy]] and military affairs, while leaving most of the local governing to the city states, a system termed [[Sympoliteia (treaty)|sympoliteia]]. In states such as the Achaean league, this also involved the admission of other ethnic groups into the federation with equal rights, in this case, non-[[Achaeans (tribe)|Achaeans]].<ref>Green (1990), p. 139.</ref> The Achean league was able to drive out the Macedonians from the Peloponnese and free Corinth, which duly joined the league. \n[[File:Colosse de Rhodes (Barclay).jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|The [[Colossus of Rhodes]], one of the seven wonders of the ancient world.]]\nOne of the few city states who managed to maintain full independence from the control of any Hellenistic kingdom was [[Rhodes]]. With a skilled navy to protect its trade fleets from pirates and an ideal strategic position covering the routes from the east into the Aegean, Rhodes prospered during the Hellenistic period. It became a center of culture and commerce, its coins were widely circulated and its philosophical schools became one of the best in the Mediterranean. After holding out for [[Siege of Rhodes (305 BC)|one year under siege by Demetrius Poliorcetes]] (305\u2013304&nbsp;BC), the Rhodians built the [[Colossus of Rhodes]] to commemorate their victory. They retained their independence by the maintenance of a powerful navy, by maintaining a carefully neutral posture and acting to preserve the balance of power between the major Hellenistic kingdoms.<ref>[[Richard Berthold|Berthold, Richard M.]], ''Rhodes in the Hellenistic Age'', Cornell University Press, 1984, p. 12.</ref>\n\nInitially Rhodes had very close ties with the Ptolemaic kingdom. Rhodes later became a Roman ally against the Seleucids, receiving some territory in [[Caria]] for their role in the [[Roman\u2013Seleucid War]] (192\u2013188&nbsp;BC). Rome eventually turned on Rhodes and annexed the island as a Roman province.\n\n===Balkans===\n[[File:Thracian Tomb of Kazanlak.jpg|thumb|Painting of a groom and bride from the Hellenistic [[Thracian Tomb of Kazanlak]], near the ancient city of [[Seuthopolis]], 4th century BC.]] \nThe west [[Balkan]] coast was inhabited by various [[List of ancient tribes in Illyria|Illyrian]] tribes and kingdoms such as the kingdom of the [[Dalmatae]] and of the [[Ardiaei]], who often engaged in [[piracy]] under [[Queen Teuta]] (reigned 231\u2013227&nbsp;BC).

Hellenistic monarchs ran their kingdoms as royal estates and most of the heavy tax revenues went into the military and paramilitary forces which preserved their rule from any kind of revolution.

In 305&nbsp;BC, he declared himself King Ptolemy&nbsp;I, later known as \"Soter\" (saviour) for his role in helping the Rhodians during the [[Siege of Rhodes (305 BC)|siege of Rhodes]]. Ptolemy built new cities such as [[Ptolemais Hermiou]] in [[upper Egypt]] and settled his veterans throughout the country, especially in the region of the [[Faiyum]]. [[Alexandria]], a major center of Greek culture and trade, became his capital city. As Egypt's first port city, it was the main grain exporter in the Mediterranean.\n\nThe [[Egyptians]] begrudgingly accepted the Ptolemies as the successors to the [[pharaoh]]s of independent Egypt, though the kingdom went through several native revolts. The Ptolemies took on the traditions of the Egyptian [[Pharaohs]], such as marrying their siblings ([[Ptolemy&nbsp;II]] was the first to adopt this custom), having themselves portrayed on public monuments in Egyptian style and dress, and participating in Egyptian religious life. The Ptolemaic ruler cult portrayed the Ptolemies as gods, and temples to the Ptolemies were erected throughout the kingdom. Ptolemy I even created a new god, [[Serapis]], who was combination of two Egyptian gods: Apis and Osiris, with attributes of [[Greek gods]]. Ptolemaic administration was, like the Ancient Egyptian bureaucracy, highly centralized and focused on squeezing as much revenue out of the population as possible though tariffs, excise duties, fines, taxes and so forth. A whole class of petty officials, tax farmers, clerks and overseers made this possible. The Egyptian countryside was directly administered by this royal bureaucracy.<ref>Green (1990), p. 193.</ref> External possessions such as Cyprus and Cyrene were run by ''strategoi'', military commanders appointed by the crown.\n\n[[File:Ring with engraved portrait of Ptolemy VI Philometor (3rd\u20132nd century BCE) - 2009.jpg|thumb|Ring of [[Ptolemy&nbsp;VI Philometor]] as Egyptian [[pharaoh]].

He and his successors also fought a series of wars with the Seleucids, known as the [[Syrian wars]], over the region of [[Coele-Syria]]. [[Ptolemy&nbsp;IV]] won the great [[battle of Raphia]] (217&nbsp;BC) against the Seleucids, using native Egyptians trained as [[phalangites]].

The most famous member of the line was the last queen, [[Cleopatra&nbsp;VII]], known for her role in the Roman political battles between [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Pompey]], and later between [[Augustus Caesar|Octavian]] and [[Mark Antony]].

His descendant, [[Attalus&nbsp;I]], defeated the invading [[Galatia]]ns and proclaimed himself an independent king. [[Attalus&nbsp;I]] (241\u2013197&nbsp;BC), was a staunch ally of Rome against [[Philip&nbsp;V of Macedon]] during the [[First Macedonian War|first]] and [[Second Macedonian War|second]] [[Macedonian Wars]]. For his support against the [[Seleucid dynasty|Seleucids]] in 190&nbsp;BC, [[Eumenes&nbsp;II]] was rewarded with all the former Seleucid domains in [[Asia Minor]]. Eumenes&nbsp;II turned Pergamon into a centre of culture and science by establishing the [[library of Pergamum]] which was said to be second only to the [[library of Alexandria]]<ref>{{cite book|title=Pergamum|website=Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th Edition, 1.}}</ref> with 200,000 volumes according to [[Plutarch]]. It included a reading room and a collection of paintings. Eumenes&nbsp;II also constructed the [[Pergamon Altar|Pergamum Altar]] with friezes depicting the [[Gigantomachy]] on the [[acropolis]] of the city. [[Pergamum]] was also a center of [[parchment]] (''charta pergamena'') production.

[[Capitoline Museums]], Rome.]]\nThe Celts who settled in [[Galatia]] came through [[Thrace]] under the leadership of Leotarios and [[Leonnorius|Leonnorios]] {{circa|270&nbsp;BC}}. They were defeated by [[Seleucus&nbsp;I]] in the 'battle of the Elephants', but were still able to establish a Celtic territory in central [[Anatolia]]. The Galatians were well respected as warriors and were widely used as mercenaries in the armies of the successor states. They continued to attack neighboring kingdoms such as [[Bithynia]] and [[Pergamon]], plundering and extracting tribute. This came to an end when they sided with the renegade Seleucid prince [[Antiochus Hierax]] who tried to defeat [[Attalus I|Attalus]], the ruler of [[Pergamon]] (241\u2013197&nbsp;BC). Attalus severely defeated the Gauls, forcing them to confine themselves to Galatia. The theme of the ''[[Dying Gaul]]'' (a famous statue displayed in [[Pergamon]]) remained a favorite in Hellenistic art for a generation signifying the victory of the Greeks over a noble enemy. In the early 2nd century BC, the Galatians became allies of [[Antiochus III|Antiochus the Great]], the last Seleucid king trying to regain suzerainty over Asia Minor. In 189&nbsp;BC, Rome sent [[Gnaeus Manlius Vulso (consul 189 BC)|Gnaeus Manlius Vulso]] on an expedition against the Galatians. Galatia was henceforth dominated by Rome through regional rulers from 189 BC onward.\n\nAfter their defeats by Pergamon and Rome the Galatians slowly became hellenized and they were called \"Gallo-Graeci\" by the historian [[Justin (historian)|Justin]]<ref>Justin, ''Epitome of Pompeius Trogus'', 25.2 and 26.2; the related subject of copulative compounds, where both are of equal weight, is exhaustively treated in Anna Granville Hatcher, ''Modern English Word-Formation and Neo-Latin: A Study of the Origins of English'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University), 1951.</ref> as well as {{lang|grc|\u1f19\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03bf\u03b3\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9}} (''Hell\u0113nogal\u00e1tai'') by [[Diodorus Siculus]] in his ''Bibliotheca historica'' v.32.5, who wrote that they were \"called Helleno-Galatians because of their connection with the Greeks.\"<ref>This distinction is remarked upon in William M.

After Alexander's conquests the region of Bithynia came under the rule of the native king Bas, who defeated Calas, a general of Alexander the Great, and maintained the independence of Bithynia. His son, [[Zipoetes&nbsp;I of Bithynia]] maintained this autonomy against [[Lysimachus]] and [[Seleucus&nbsp;I]], and assumed the title of king (''basileus'') in 297&nbsp;BC. His son and successor, [[Nicomedes&nbsp;I]], founded [[Nicomedia]], which soon rose to great prosperity, and during his long reign ({{circa|278|255&nbsp;BC}}), as well as those of his successors, the kingdom of Bithynia held a considerable place among the minor monarchies of Anatolia. Nicomedes also invited the Celtic Galatians into Anatolia as mercenaries, and they later turned on his son Prusias I, who defeated them in battle. Their last king, Nicomedes&nbsp;IV, was unable to maintain himself against Mithridates&nbsp;VI of Pontus, and, after being restored to his throne by the Roman Senate, he bequeathed his kingdom by will to the Roman republic (74&nbsp;BC).\n\n===Cappadocia===\n{{Main|Cappadocia}}\nCappadocia, a mountainous region situated between Pontus and the Taurus mountains, was ruled by a Persian dynasty. [[Ariarathes&nbsp;I]] (332\u2013322&nbsp;BC) was the satrap of Cappadocia under the Persians and after the conquests of Alexander he retained his post. After Alexander's death he was defeated by Eumenes and [[crucifixion|crucified]] in 322&nbsp;BC, but his son, Ariarathes&nbsp;II managed to regain the throne and maintain his autonomy against the warring Diadochi.\n\nIn 255&nbsp;BC, Ariarathes&nbsp;III took the title of king and married Stratonice, a daughter of Antiochus&nbsp;II, remaining an ally of the Seleucid kingdom. Under Ariarathes&nbsp;IV, Cappadocia came into relations with Rome, first as a foe espousing the cause of [[Antiochus the Great]], then as an ally against Perseus of Macedon and finally in a war against the Seleucids. Ariarathes&nbsp;V also waged war with Rome against Aristonicus, a claimant to the throne of Pergamon, and their forces were annihilated in 130&nbsp;BC. This defeat allowed Pontus to invade and conquer the kingdom.\n\n===Kingdom of Pontus===\n{{Main|Kingdom of Pontus}}\n[[File:Mithridates VI Louvre.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|Bust of [[Mithridates&nbsp;VI]] sporting a lion pelt headdress, a symbol of [[Herakles]].]]\nThe [[Kingdom of Pontus]] was a Hellenistic kingdom on the southern coast of the [[Black Sea]]. It was founded by [[Mithridates I of Pontus|Mithridates&nbsp;I]] in 291&nbsp;BC and lasted until its conquest by the Roman Republic in 63&nbsp;BC. Despite being ruled by a dynasty which was a descendant of the Persian [[Achaemenid Empire]] it became hellenized due to the influence of the Greek cities on the Black Sea and its neighboring kingdoms. Pontic culture was a mix of Greek and Iranian elements; the most hellenized parts of the kingdom were on the coast, populated by Greek colonies such as [[Trapezus, Arcadia|Trapezus]] and [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]], the latter of which became the capital of the kingdom. Epigraphic evidence also shows extensive Hellenistic influence in the interior. During the reign of Mithridates&nbsp;II, Pontus was allied with the Seleucids through dynastic marriages. By the time of Mithridates&nbsp;VI Eupator, Greek was the official language of the kingdom, though Anatolian languages continued to be spoken.\n\nThe kingdom grew to its largest extent under [[Mithridates&nbsp;VI]], who conquered [[Colchis]], [[Cappadocia]], [[Paphlagonia]], [[Bithynia]], Lesser Armenia, the [[Bosporan Kingdom]], the Greek colonies of the Tauric [[Chersonesus|Chersonesos]] and, for a brief time, the Roman province of Asia. Mithridates, himself of mixed Persian and Greek ancestry, presented himself as the protector of the Greeks against the 'barbarians' of Rome styling himself as \"King Mithridates Eupator Dionysus\"<ref name=\"The Foreign Policy of Mithridates VI Eupator, King of Pontus\">{{cite book | last = McGing | first = B.

Mithridates also depicted himself with the ''anastole'' hairstyle of Alexander and used the symbolism of [[Herakles]], from whom the Macedonian kings claimed descent. After a long struggle with Rome in the Mithridatic wars, Pontus was defeated; part of it was incorporated into the Roman Republic as the province of Bithynia, while Pontus' eastern half survived as a client kingdom.\n\n===Armenia===\n{{Main|Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)}}\n[[File:Maps of the Armenian Empire of Tigranes.gif|thumb|upright=1.05|Tigranes the Great's Armenian Empire]]\n[[Orontid Dynasty|Orontid Armenia]] formally passed to the empire of Alexander the Great following his conquest of Persia. Alexander appointed an Orontid named Mithranes to govern Armenia. Armenia later became a vassal state of the [[Seleucid Empire]], but it maintained a considerable degree of autonomy, retaining its native rulers. Towards the end 212&nbsp;BC the country was divided into two kingdoms, Greater Armenia and Armenia [[Sophene]], including [[Commagene]] or Armenia Minor. The kingdoms became so independent from Seleucid control that [[Antiochus&nbsp;III the Great]] waged war on them during his reign and replaced their rulers.\n\nAfter the Seleucid defeat at the [[Battle of Magnesia]] in 190&nbsp;BC, the kings of [[Sophene]] and Greater Armenia revolted and declared their independence, with [[Artaxias I|Artaxias]] becoming the first king of the [[Artaxiad dynasty]] of Armenia in 188&nbsp;BC. During the reign of the Artaxiads, Armenia went through a period of [[hellenization]]. [[Numismatic]] evidence shows Greek artistic styles and the use of the Greek language. Some coins describe the Armenian kings as \"[[Philhellenes]]\". During the reign of [[Tigranes the Great]] (95\u201355&nbsp;BC), the kingdom of Armenia reached its greatest extent, containing many Greek cities, including the entire [[Syrian tetrapolis]]. [[Cleopatra of Pontus|Cleopatra]], the wife of [[Tigranes the Great]], invited Greeks such as the [[Rhetoric|rhetor]] Amphicrates and the historian [[Metrodorus of Scepsis]] to the Armenian court, and\u2014according to Plutarch\u2014when the Roman general Lucullus seized the Armenian capital, Tigranocerta, he found a troupe of Greek actors who had arrived to perform plays for Tigranes.<ref>Grousset pp.90-91</ref> Tigranes' successor [[Artavasdes&nbsp;II]] even composed Greek tragedies himself.\n\n===Parthia===\n{{also|Parthian Empire}}\n[[File:Orodesi.jpg|thumb|Coin of [[Phraates&nbsp;IV]] with Hellenistic titles such as Euergetes, Epiphanes and [[Philhellene]] (fond of Greek [culture])]]\n[[File:Sarbaz Nysa.jpg|thumb|150px|A sculpted head (broken off from a larger statue) of a Parthian wearing a [[Hellenistic armies|Hellenistic-style helmet]], from the Parthian royal residence and necropolis of [[Nisa, Turkmenistan]], 2nd century BC]]\n\n[[Parthia]] was a north-eastern Iranian [[satrapy]] of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] which later passed on to Alexander's empire. Under the Seleucids, Parthia was governed by various Greek [[satraps]] such as [[Nicanor (satrap)|Nicanor]] and [[Philip (satrap)|Philip]]. In 247&nbsp;BC, following the death of [[Antiochus&nbsp;II Theos]], [[Andragoras (Seleucid satrap)|Andragoras]], the Seleucid governor of Parthia, proclaimed his independence and began minting coins showing himself wearing a royal diadem and claiming kingship. He ruled until 238&nbsp;BC when [[Arsaces I of Parthia|Arsaces]], the leader of the [[Parni]] tribe conquered Parthia, killing Andragoras and inaugurating the [[Parthian Empire|Arsacid Dynasty]]. [[Antiochus&nbsp;III]] recaptured Arsacid controlled territory in 209&nbsp;BC from [[Arsaces&nbsp;II]]. Arsaces&nbsp;II sued for peace and became a vassal of the Seleucids. It was not until the reign of [[Phraates&nbsp;I]] ({{circa|176\u2013171&nbsp;BC}}), that the Arsacids would again begin to assert their independence.<ref>Bivar, A.D.H. (1983), \"The Political History of Iran under the Arsacids\", in Yarshater, Ehsan, Cambridge History of Iran 3.1, Cambridge UP, pp. 21\u201399.</ref>\n\nDuring the reign of [[Mithridates&nbsp;I of Parthia]], Arsacid control expanded to include [[Herat]] (in 167&nbsp;BC), [[Babylonia]] (in 144&nbsp;BC), [[Media (region)|Media]] (in 141&nbsp;BC), [[Persis|Persia]] (in 139&nbsp;BC), and large parts of [[Syria (region)|Syria]] (in the 110s&nbsp;BC). The [[Seleucid\u2013Parthian wars]] continued as the Seleucids invaded Mesopotamia under [[Antiochus&nbsp;VII Sidetes]] ({{reigned|138\u2013129&nbsp;BC}}), but he was eventually killed by a Parthian counterattack. After the fall of the Seleucid dynasty, the Parthians fought frequently against neighbouring Rome in the [[Roman\u2013Parthian Wars]] (66&nbsp;BC&nbsp;\u2013 AD&nbsp;217). Abundant traces of Hellenism continued under the Parthian empire. The Parthians used Greek as well as their own [[Parthian language]] (though lesser than Greek) as languages of administration and also used Greek [[drachma]]s as coinage. They enjoyed [[Greek theater]], and [[Greek art]] influenced [[Parthian art]]. The Parthians continued worshipping Greek gods [[Syncretism#Religious syncretism|syncretized]] together with Iranian deities. Their rulers established ruler cults in the manner of Hellenistic kings and often used Hellenistic royal [[epithets]].\n\nThe Hellenistic influence in Iran was significant in terms of scope, but not depth and durability\u2014unlike the Near East, the Iranian\u2013[[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] ideas and ideals remained the main source of inspiration in mainland Iran, and was soon revived in late Parthian and [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] periods.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Yarshater |first1=Ehsan |title=The Cambridge History of Iran |date=1983 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521200929 |page=1xi |language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Nabatean Kingdom===\n{{Main|Nabatean Kingdom}}\n[[File:Petra Jordan BW 21.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Al-Khazneh]] in [[Petra]] shows the Hellenistic influences on the Nabatean capital city]]\nThe [[Nabatean Kingdom]] was an [[Arab]] state located between the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. Its capital was the city of [[Petra]], an important trading city on the [[incense route]]. The Nabateans resisted the attacks of [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus|Antigonus]] and were allies of the Hasmoneans in their struggle against the [[Seleucids]], but later fought against [[Herod the Great]]. The hellenization of the Nabateans occurred relatively late in comparison to the surrounding regions. Nabatean [[material culture]] does not show any Greek influence until the reign of [[Aretas&nbsp;III]] Philhellene in the 1st century BC.<ref>Bedal, Leigh-Ann; The Petra Pool-complex: A Hellenistic Paradeisos in the Nabataean Capital, pg 178.</ref> Aretas captured [[Damascus]] and built the Petra pool complex and gardens in the Hellenistic style. Though the Nabateans originally worshipped their traditional gods in symbolic form such as stone blocks or pillars, during the Hellenistic period they began to identify their gods with Greek gods and depict them in figurative forms influenced by Greek sculpture.<ref>NABATAEAN PANTHEON, http://nabataea.net/gods.html</ref> Nabatean art shows Greek influences and paintings have been found depicting [[Dionysus|Dionysian]] scenes.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Alberge |first1=Dalya |title=Discovery of ancient cave paintings in Petra stuns art scholars |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/aug/22/hellenistic-wall-paintings-petra |website=Theguardian |date=21 August 2010}}</ref> They also slowly adopted Greek as a language of commerce along with Aramaic and Arabic.\n\n===Judea===\n{{Main|Coele-Syria}}\n{{further|Hellenistic Judaism|Hasmonean dynasty}}\n[[File:Jerusalem Modell BW 3.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Holyland Model of Jerusalem|Model]] of [[Herod's Temple]] (renovation of the [[Second Temple]]) in the [[Israel Museum]]]]\nDuring the Hellenistic period, [[Judea]] became a frontier region between the [[Seleucid Empire]] and [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] and therefore was often the frontline of the Syrian wars, changing hands several times during these conflicts.<ref>Green (1990), p. 499.</ref> Under the Hellenistic kingdoms, Judea was ruled by the hereditary office of the [[High Priest of Israel]] as a Hellenistic vassal. This period also saw the rise of a [[Hellenistic Judaism]], which first developed in the Jewish diaspora of Alexandria and Antioch, and then spread to Judea. The major literary product of this cultural syncretism is the [[Septuagint]] translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] from [[Biblical Hebrew]] and [[Biblical Aramaic]] to [[Koin\u00e9 Greek]]. The reason for the production of this translation seems to be that many of the Alexandrian Jews had lost the ability to speak Hebrew and Aramaic.<ref>Green (1990), p. 501.</ref>\n\nBetween 301 and 219&nbsp;BC the Ptolemies ruled Judea in relative peace, and Jews often found themselves working in the Ptolemaic administration and army, which led to the rise of a Hellenized Jewish elite class (e.g. the [[Tobiads]]). The wars of [[Antiochus&nbsp;III]] brought the region into the Seleucid empire; Jerusalem fell to his control in 198&nbsp;BC and the Temple was repaired and provided with money and tribute.<ref>Green (1990), p. 504.</ref> [[Antiochus&nbsp;IV Epiphanes]] sacked Jerusalem and looted the Temple in 169&nbsp;BC after disturbances in Judea during his abortive invasion of Egypt. Antiochus then banned key [[Judaism|Jewish religious rites and traditions]] in Judea. He may have been attempting to Hellenize the region and unify his empire and the Jewish resistance to this eventually led to an escalation of violence. Whatever the case, tensions between pro- and anti-Seleucid Jewish factions led to the 174\u2013135&nbsp;BC [[Maccabean Revolt]] of [[Judas Maccabeus]] (whose victory is celebrated in the Jewish festival of [[Hanukkah]]).\n\nModern interpretations see this period as a civil war between Hellenized and orthodox forms of Judaism.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/faithbased/2005/12/the_maccabees_and_the_hellenists.html |title=The Maccabees and the Hellenists |last=Ponet |first=James |date=22 December 2005 |work=Faith-based |publisher=Slate |accessdate=4 December 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"simpletoremember\">{{cite web |url=http://www.simpletoremember.com/articles/a/the_revolt_of_the_maccabees/ |title=The Revolt of the Maccabees |publisher=Simpletoremember.com |accessdate=2012-08-13}}</ref> Out of this revolt was formed an independent Jewish kingdom known as the [[Hasmonaean Dynasty]], which lasted from 165&nbsp;BC to 63&nbsp;BC. The Hasmonean Dynasty eventually disintegrated in [[Hyrcanus II#Deposition|a civil war]], which [[Hyrcanus II#Roman intervention|coincided with civil wars in Rome]]. The last Hasmonean ruler, [[Antigonus&nbsp;II Mattathias]], was captured by Herod and executed in 37&nbsp;BC. In spite of originally being a revolt against Greek overlordship, the Hasmonean kingdom and also the [[Herodian kingdom]] which followed gradually became more and more hellenized. From 37&nbsp;BC to 4&nbsp;BC, [[Herod the Great]] ruled as a Jewish-Roman client king appointed by the [[Roman Senate]]. He considerably enlarged the Temple (see [[Herod's Temple]]), making it one of the largest religious structures in the world. The style of the enlarged temple and other [[Herodian architecture]] shows significant Hellenistic architectural influence. His son, [[Herod Archelaus]], ruled from 4&nbsp;BC to AD&nbsp;6 when he was deposed for the formation of [[Roman Judea]].\n\n==Greco-Bactrians==\n{{Main|Greco-Bactrian kingdom}}{{see also|Hellenistic influence on Indian art}}\n[[File:Greco-BactrianKingdomMap.jpg|thumb|right|The Greco-Bactrian kingdom at its maximum extent ({{circa|180&nbsp;BC}}).]]\n[[File:DemetriusIMet.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.8|Silver coin depicting [[Demetrius&nbsp;I of Bactria]] (reigned {{circa|200\u2013180&nbsp;BC}}), wearing an elephant scalp, symbol of his conquests of areas in the northwest of [[South Asia]], where [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]] are today.<ref>Demetrius is said to have founded [[Taxila]] (archaeological excavations), and also [[Sagala]] in the Punjab, which he seemed to have called Euthydemia, after his father (\"the city of Sagala, also called Euthydemia\" (Ptolemy, Geographia, VII 1))</ref>]]\n\nThe Greek kingdom of Bactria began as a breakaway satrapy of the Seleucid empire, which, because of the size of the empire, had significant freedom from central control. Between 255 and 246&nbsp;BC, the governor of [[Bactria]], [[Sogdiana]] and [[Margiana]] (most of present-day [[Afghanistan]]), one [[Diodotus I|Diodotus]], took this process to its logical extreme and declared himself king. Diodotus&nbsp;II, son of Diodotus, was overthrown in about 230&nbsp;BC by [[Euthydemus I|Euthydemus]], possibly the satrap of Sogdiana, who then started his own dynasty. In {{circa|210&nbsp;BC}}, the Greco-Bactrian kingdom was invaded by a resurgent Seleucid empire under [[Antiochus&nbsp;III]]. While victorious in the field, it seems Antiochus came to realise that there were advantages in the status quo (perhaps sensing that Bactria could not be governed from Syria), and married one of his daughters to Euthydemus's son, thus legitimising the Greco-Bactrian dynasty. Soon afterwards the Greco-Bactrian kingdom seems to have expanded, possibly taking advantage of the defeat of the Parthian king [[Arsaces II of Parthia|Arsaces&nbsp;II]] by Antiochus.\n\nAccording to [[Strabo]], the Greco-Bactrians seem to have had contacts with China through the [[silk road]] trade routes (Strabo, XI.11.1). Indian sources also maintain religious contact between Buddhist monks and the Greeks, and some Greco-Bactrians did convert to [[Buddhism]]. [[Demetrius I of Bactria|Demetrius]], son and successor of Euthydemus, invaded north-western India in 180&nbsp;BC, after the destruction of the Mauryan Empire there; the Mauryans were probably allies of the Bactrians (and Seleucids). The exact justification for the invasion remains unclear, but by about 175&nbsp;BC, the Greeks ruled over parts of northwestern India. This period also marks the beginning of the obfuscation of Greco-Bactrian history. Demetrius possibly died about 180&nbsp;BC; numismatic evidence suggests the existence of several other kings shortly thereafter. It is probable that at this point the Greco-Bactrian kingdom split into several semi-independent regions for some years, often warring amongst themselves. Heliocles was the last Greek to clearly rule Bactria, his power collapsing in the face of central Asian tribal invasions ([[Scythian]] and [[Yuezhi]]), by about 130&nbsp;BC. However, Greek urban civilisation seems to have continued in Bactria after the fall of the kingdom, having a hellenising effect on the tribes which had displaced Greek rule. The [[Kushan Empire]] which followed continued to use Greek on their coinage and Greeks continued being influential in the empire.\n\n==Indo-Greek kingdoms==\n{{Main|Indo-Greeks}}\n{{See also|Indo-Greek religions}}\n[[File:Indo-Greeks 100bc.jpg|thumb|right|Indo-Greek Kingdoms in 100&nbsp;BC.]]\n[[File:Buddha-Vajrapani-Herakles.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Heracles]] as protector of Buddha, [[Vajrapani]], 2nd-century [[Gandhara]].]]\nThe separation of the [[Indo-Greek kingdom]] from the [[Greco-Bactrian kingdom]] resulted in an even more isolated position, and thus the details of the Indo-Greek kingdom are even more obscure than for Bactria. Many supposed kings in India are known only because of coins bearing their name. The numismatic evidence together with archaeological finds and the scant historical records suggest that the fusion of eastern and western cultures reached its peak in the Indo-Greek kingdom.\n\nAfter Demetrius' death, civil wars between Bactrian kings in India allowed [[Apollodotus&nbsp;I]] (from {{circa|180/175&nbsp;BC}}) to make himself independent as the first proper Indo-Greek king (who did not rule from Bactria). Large numbers of his coins have been found in India, and he seems to have reigned in [[Gandhara]] as well as western [[Punjab]]. Apollodotus&nbsp;I was succeeded by or ruled alongside [[Antimachus&nbsp;II]], likely the son of the Bactrian king [[Antimachus&nbsp;I]].<ref>Bopearachchi, ''Monnaies'', p.63</ref> In about 155 (or 165) BC he seems to have been succeeded by the most successful of the Indo-Greek kings, [[Menander&nbsp;I]]. Menander converted to [[Buddhism]], and seems to have been a great patron of the religion; he is remembered in some Buddhist texts as 'Milinda'.

This inevitably weakened the Greek position, and territory seems to have been lost progressively. Around 70&nbsp;BC, the western regions of [[Arachosia]] and [[Paropamisadae]] were lost to tribal invasions, presumably by those tribes responsible for the end of the Bactrian kingdom. The resulting [[Indo-Scythians|Indo-Scythian]] kingdom seems to have gradually pushed the remaining Indo-Greek kingdom towards the east. The Indo-Greek kingdom appears to have lingered on in western Punjab until about AD&nbsp;10, at which time it was finally ended by the Indo-Scythians.\n\nAfter conquering the Indo-Greeks, the [[Kushan empire]] took over [[Greco-Buddhism]], the Greek language, [[Greek script]], Greek coinage and artistic styles. Greeks continued being an important part of the cultural world of India for generations. The depictions of the Buddha appear to have been influenced by Greek culture: Buddha representations in the Ghandara period often showed Buddha under the protection of Herakles.<ref name=\"sanujit\">Ghose, Sanujit (2011).

Hellenism or at least [[Philhellenism]] reached most regions on the frontiers of the Hellenistic kingdoms. Though some of these regions were not ruled by Greeks or even Greek speaking elites, certain Hellenistic influences can be seen in the historical record and [[material culture]] of these regions. Other regions had established contact with Greek colonies before this period, and simply saw a continued process of [[Hellenization]] and intermixing.\n\nBefore the Hellenistic period, Greek colonies had been established on the coast of the [[Crimean]] and [[Taman peninsula]]s. The [[Bosporan Kingdom]] was a multi-ethnic kingdom of Greek city states and local tribal peoples such as the [[Maeotians]], [[Thracians]], Crimean [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]] under the [[Spartocids|Spartocid dynasty]] (438\u2013110&nbsp;BC). The Spartocids were a hellenized Thracian family from [[Panticapaeum]]. The Bosporans had long lasting trade contacts with the [[Scythian]] peoples of the [[Pontic-Caspian steppe]], and Hellenistic influence can be seen in the Scythian settlements of the [[Crimea]], such as in the [[Scythian Neapolis]]. Scythian pressure on the Bosporan kingdom under Paerisades&nbsp;V led to its eventual vassalage under the Pontic king [[Mithradates&nbsp;VI]] for protection, {{circa|107&nbsp;BC}}. It later became a Roman client state. Other [[Scythians]] on the steppes of [[Central Asia]] came into contact with Hellenistic culture through the Greeks of Bactria. Many Scythian elites purchased Greek products and some [[Scythian art]] shows Greek influences. At least some Scythians seem to have become Hellenized, because we know of conflicts between the elites of the Scythian kingdom over the adoption of Greek ways. These Hellenized Scythians were known as the \"young Scythians\".<ref>Claessen & Skaln\u00edk (editors), The Early State, page 428.</ref> The peoples around [[Olbia, Ukraine|Pontic Olbia]], known as the ''Callipidae'', were intermixed and Hellenized Greco-Scythians.<ref>Gent, John.

Carthaginian culture came into contact with the Greeks through [[Punic]] colonies in [[Sicily]] and through their widespread Mediterranean trade network. While the Carthaginians retained their [[Punic]] culture and language, they did adopt some Hellenistic ways, one of the most prominent of which was their military practices. In 550&nbsp;BC, [[Mago&nbsp;I of Carthage]] began a series of military reforms which included copying the army of [[Timoleon]], [[Tyrant of Syracuse]].<ref>[[Justin (historian)|Justin]], 19, 1.1</ref> The core of Carthage's military was the Greek-style [[phalanx]] formed by citizen [[hoplite]] spearmen who had been [[conscripted]] into service, though their armies also included large numbers of mercenaries. After their defeat in the [[First Punic War]], Carthage hired a Spartan mercenary captain, [[Xanthippus of Carthage]], to reform their military forces. Xanthippus reformed the Carthaginian military along [[Ancient Macedonian army|Macedonian army]] lines.\n\nBy the 2nd century BC, the kingdom of [[Numidia]] also began to see Hellenistic culture influence its art and architecture. The Numidian royal monument at [[Chemtou]] is one example of Numidian Hellenized architecture. Reliefs on the monument also show the Numidians had adopted Greco-Macedonian type armor and shields for their soldiers.<ref>Prag & Quinn (editors). The Hellenistic West, pp. 229\u2013237.</ref>\n \nPtolemaic Egypt was the center of Hellenistic influence in Africa and Greek colonies also thrived in the region of [[Cyrene, Libya]]. The kingdom of [[Mero\u00eb]] was in constant contact with Ptolemaic Egypt and Hellenistic influences can be seen in their art and archaeology. There was a temple to [[Serapis]], the Greco-Egyptian god.\n\n==Rise of Rome==\n[[File:East-Hem 100bc.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Eastern hemisphere at the end of the 2nd century BC.]]\nWidespread Roman interference in the Greek world was probably inevitable given the general manner of the ascendancy of the [[Roman Republic]]. This Roman-Greek interaction began as a consequence of the Greek city-states located along the coast of southern Italy. Rome had come to dominate the Italian peninsula, and desired the submission of the Greek cities to its rule. Although they initially resisted, allying themselves with [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]], and defeating the Romans at several battles, the Greek cities were unable to maintain this position and were absorbed by the Roman republic. Shortly afterwards, Rome became involved in Sicily, fighting against the [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] in the [[First Punic War]]. The end result was the complete conquest of Sicily, including its previously powerful Greek cities, by the Romans.\n\nRoman entanglement in the Balkans began when Illyrian piratical raids on Roman merchants led to invasions of Illyria (the [[First Illyrian War|First]] and, [[Second Illyrian War]]s). Tension between Macedon and Rome increased when the young king of Macedon, [[Philip V of Macedon|Philip&nbsp;V]], harbored one of the chief pirates, [[Demetrius of Pharos]]<ref>{{cite book |title=Alexander The Great and the Hellenistic Age |pages=98\u201399 |last=Green |first=P |isbn=978-0-7538-2413-9|year=2008 }}</ref> (a former client of Rome). As a result, in an attempt to reduce Roman influence in the Balkans, Philip allied himself with Carthage after [[Hannibal]] had dealt the Romans a massive defeat at the [[Battle of Cannae]] (216&nbsp;BC) during the [[Second Punic War]]. Forcing the Romans to fight on another front when they were at a nadir of manpower gained Philip the lasting enmity of the Romans\u2014the only real result from the somewhat insubstantial [[First Macedonian War]] (215\u2013202&nbsp;BC).\n\nOnce the [[Second Punic War]] had been resolved, and the Romans had begun to regather their strength, they looked to re-assert their influence in the Balkans, and to curb the expansion of Philip. A pretext for war was provided by Philip's refusal to end his [[Cretan War (205\u2013200 BC)|war]] with [[Attalid dynasty|Attalid]] [[Pergamum]] and [[Rhodes]], both Roman allies.<ref>{{cite book |title=Alexander The Great and the Hellenistic Age |pages=102\u2013103 |last=Green |first=P |isbn=978-0-7538-2413-9|year=2008 }}</ref> The Romans, also allied with the [[Aetolian League]] of Greek city-states (which resented Philip's power), thus declared war on Macedon in 200&nbsp;BC, starting the [[Second Macedonian War]]. This ended with a decisive Roman victory at the [[Battle of Cynoscephalae]] (197&nbsp;BC). Like most Roman peace treaties of the period, the resultant 'Peace of Flaminius' was designed utterly to crush the power of the defeated party; a massive indemnity was levied, Philip's fleet was surrendered to Rome, and Macedon was effectively returned to its ancient boundaries, losing influence over the city-states of southern Greece, and land in Thrace and Asia Minor. The result was the end of Macedon as a major power in the Mediterranean.\n\nAs a result of the confusion in Greece at the end of the Second Macedonian War, the Seleucid Empire also became entangled with the Romans. The Seleucid [[Antiochus&nbsp;III]] had allied with Philip&nbsp;V of Macedon in 203&nbsp;BC, agreeing that they should jointly conquer the lands of the boy-king of Egypt, [[Ptolemy&nbsp;V]]. After defeating Ptolemy in the [[Fifth Syrian War]], Antiochus concentrated on occupying the Ptolemaic possessions in Asia Minor. However, this brought Antiochus into conflict with Rhodes and Pergamum, two important Roman allies, and began a 'cold war' between Rome and Antiochus (not helped by the presence of Hannibal at the Seleucid court).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Meanwhile, in mainland Greece, the [[Aetolian League]], which had sided with Rome against Macedon, now grew to resent the Roman presence in Greece. This presented Antiochus&nbsp;III with a pretext to invade Greece and 'liberate' it from Roman influence, thus starting the [[Roman-Syrian War]] (192\u2013188&nbsp;BC). In 191&nbsp;BC, the Romans under Manius Acilius Glabrio routed him at Thermopylae and obliged him to withdraw to Asia. During the course of this war Roman troops moved into Asia for the first time, where they defeated Antiochus again at the [[Battle of Magnesia]] (190&nbsp;BC). A crippling treaty was imposed on Antiochus, with Seleucid possessions in Asia Minor removed and given to Rhodes and Pergamum, the size of the Seleucid navy reduced, and a massive war indemnity invoked.\n[[File:Jean-Fran\u00e7ois-Pierre Peyron 001.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Perseus of Macedon surrenders to Paullus.

[[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]], [[Budapest]].]]\nThus, in less than twenty years, Rome had destroyed the power of one of the successor states, crippled another, and firmly entrenched its influence over Greece. This was primarily a result of the over-ambition of the Macedonian kings, and their unintended provocation of Rome, though Rome was quick to exploit the situation. In another twenty years, the Macedonian kingdom was no more. Seeking to re-assert Macedonian power and Greek independence, Philip&nbsp;V's son [[Perseus of Macedon|Perseus]] incurred the wrath of the Romans, resulting in the [[Third Macedonian War]] (171\u2013168&nbsp;BC). Victorious, the Romans abolished the Macedonian kingdom, replacing it with four puppet republics; these lasted a further twenty years before Macedon was formally annexed as a Roman province (146&nbsp;BC) after yet another rebellion under [[Andriscus]]. Rome now demanded that the Achaean League, the last stronghold of Greek independence, be dissolved. The Achaeans refused and declared war on Rome. Most of the Greek cities rallied to the Achaeans' side, even slaves were freed to fight for Greek independence. The Roman consul [[Lucius Mummius]] advanced from Macedonia and defeated the Greeks at [[Corinth]], which was razed to the ground. In 146&nbsp;BC, the Greek peninsula, though not the islands, became a Roman protectorate. Roman taxes were imposed, except in Athens and Sparta, and all the cities had to accept rule by Rome's local allies.\n\nThe Attalid dynasty of Pergamum lasted little longer; a Roman ally until the end, its final king [[Attalus&nbsp;III]] died in 133&nbsp;BC without an heir, and taking the alliance to its natural conclusion, willed Pergamum to the Roman Republic.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite book |title=Rubicon: Triumph and Tragedy in the Roman Republic |last=Holland |first=T |isbn=978-0-349-11563-4|year=2004 }}</ref> The final Greek resistance came in 88&nbsp;BC, when King [[Mithridates VI of Pontus|Mithridates]] of [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontus]] rebelled against Rome, captured Roman held Anatolia, and massacred up to 100,000 Romans and Roman allies across Asia Minor. Many Greek cities, including Athens, overthrew their Roman puppet rulers and joined him in the [[Mithridatic wars]]. When he was driven out of Greece by the Roman general [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]], the latter laid siege to Athens and razed the city. Mithridates was finally defeated by [[Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus]] (Pompey the Great) in 65&nbsp;BC. Further ruin was brought to Greece by the Roman civil wars, which were partly fought in Greece. Finally, in 27&nbsp;BC, [[Caesar Augustus|Augustus]] directly annexed Greece to the new [[Roman Empire]] as the [[Achaea Province, Roman Empire|province of Achaea]]. The struggles with Rome had left Greece depopulated and demoralised. Nevertheless, Roman rule at least brought an end to warfare, and cities such as Athens, Corinth, Thessaloniki and [[Patras]] soon recovered their prosperity.\n\nContrarily, having so firmly entrenched themselves into Greek affairs, the Romans now completely ignored the rapidly disintegrating Seleucid empire (perhaps because it posed no threat); and left the Ptolemaic kingdom to decline quietly, while acting as a protector of sorts, in as much as to stop other powers taking Egypt over (including the famous line-in-the-sand [[Gaius Popillius Laenas|incident]] when the Seleucid [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] tried to invade Egypt).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Eventually, instability in the near east resulting from the power vacuum left by the collapse of the Seleucid Empire caused the Roman [[proconsul]] [[Pompey the Great]] to abolish the Seleucid rump state, absorbing much of Syria into the Roman Republic.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Famously, the end of Ptolemaic Egypt came as the final act in the republican civil war between the Roman triumvirs [[Mark Antony|Mark Anthony]] and [[Augustus Caesar]]. After the defeat of Anthony and his lover, the last Ptolemaic monarch, [[Cleopatra&nbsp;VII]], at the [[Battle of Actium]], Augustus invaded Egypt and took it as his own personal fiefdom.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> He thereby completed both the destruction of the Hellenistic kingdoms and the Roman Republic, and ended (in hindsight) the Hellenistic era.\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:ancientlibraryalex.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Library of Alexandria|Library]] of [[Alexandria]] in the [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic Kingdom]], here shown in an artist's impression, was the largest and most significant [[List of libraries in the ancient world|library of the ancient world]].<ref name=\"Sagan, C. 1980\">Cosmos: A Personal Voyage, Sagan, C 1980, {{YouTube|Pa1ImgOcOPM|\"Episode 1: The Shores of the Cosmic Ocean\"}}</ref>]]\n[[File:Rosetta Stone.JPG|thumb|alt=\"A large dark grey-coloured slab of stone with text that uses Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, demotic and Greek script in three separate horizontal registers\"|The [[Rosetta Stone]], a trilingual Ptolemaic decree establishing the religious cult of [[Ptolemy&nbsp;V]]]]\n\nIn some fields Hellenistic culture thrived, particularly in its preservation of the past. The states of the Hellenistic period were deeply fixated with the past and its seemingly lost glories.<ref>Green (1990), pp. xx, 68\u201369.</ref> The preservation of many classical and archaic works of art and literature (including the works of the three great classical tragedians, [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]], and [[Euripides]]) are due to the efforts of the Hellenistic Greeks. The museum and library of Alexandria was the center of this conservationist activity. With the support of royal stipends, Alexandrian scholars collected, translated, copied, classified, and critiqued every book they could find. Most of the great literary figures of the Hellenistic period studied at Alexandria and conducted research there. They were scholar poets, writing not only poetry but treatises on Homer and other archaic and classical Greek literature.<ref>Bugh, Glenn R. (editor). The Cambridge Companion to the Hellenistic World, 2007. p. 190.</ref>\n\n[[Athens]] retained its position as the most prestigious seat of higher education, especially in the domains of philosophy and rhetoric, with considerable libraries and philosophical schools.<ref name=mcleod>{{cite book |author=Roy M.

Settlements such as [[Ai-Khanoum]], on trade routes, allowed Greek culture to mix and spread. The language of Philip&nbsp;II's and Alexander's court and army (which was made up of various Greek and non-Greek speaking peoples) was a version of [[Attic Greek]], and over time this language developed into [[Koine]], the [[lingua franca]] of the successor states.\n\nThe identification of local gods with similar Greek deities, a practice termed '[[Interpretatio graeca]]', stimulated the building of Greek-style temples, and Greek culture in the cities meant that buildings such as [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasia]] and [[Theatre of ancient Greece#Characteristics of the buildings|theaters]] became common. Many cities maintained nominal autonomy while under the rule of the local king or [[satrap]], and often had Greek-style institutions. Greek dedications, statues, architecture, and inscriptions have all been found. However, local cultures were not replaced, and mostly went on as before, but now with a new Greco-Macedonian or otherwise Hellenized elite. An example that shows the spread of Greek theater is [[Plutarch]]'s story of the death of [[Crassus]], in which his head was taken to the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] court and used as a prop in a performance of [[The Bacchae]]. Theaters have also been found: for example, in [[Ai-Khanoum]] on the edge of [[Bactria]], the theater has 35 rows \u2013 larger than the theater in [[Babylon]].\n\nThe spread of Greek influence and language is also shown through [[Ancient Greek coinage]]. Portraits became more realistic, and the obverse of the coin was often used to display a propagandistic image, commemorating an event or displaying the image of a favored god. The use of Greek-style portraits and Greek language continued under the Roman, [[Parthian empire|Parthian]], and [[Kushan empire]]s, even as the use of Greek was in decline.\n\n===Hellenization and acculturation===\n[[File:Gandhara Buddha (tnm).jpeg|thumb|One of the first representations of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], and an example of [[Greco-Buddhist art]], 1st-2nd century AD, [[Gandhara]]: [[Standing Buddha (Tokyo National Museum)]].]]\n[[File:Rampurva bull in Presidential Palace high closeup.jpg|thumb|Bull [[Capital (architecture)|capital]] from [[Rampurva]], one of the [[Pillars of Ashoka]], [[Maurya Empire]], 3rd century BC.

Notice the florals on the bull capital from Rampurva, and the style of the horse on the Sarnath capital, now the emblem of the Republic of India.\"</ref>]]\n{{Further|Hellenization}} omg\nThe concept of Hellenization, meaning the adoption of Greek culture in non-Greek regions, has long been controversial. Undoubtedly Greek influence did spread through the Hellenistic realms, but to what extent, and whether this was a deliberate policy or mere cultural diffusion, have been hotly debated.\n\nIt seems likely that Alexander himself pursued policies which led to Hellenization, such as the foundations of new cities and Greek colonies. While it may have been a deliberate attempt to spread Greek culture (or as Arrian says, \"to civilise the natives\"), it is more likely that it was a series of pragmatic measures designed to aid in the rule of his enormous empire.<ref name=\"Green, p. 21\">Green, p. 21.</ref> Cities and colonies were centers of administrative control and Macedonian power in a newly conquered region. Alexander also seems to have attempted to create a mixed Greco-Persian elite class as shown by the [[Susa weddings]] and his adoption of some forms of Persian dress and court culture. He also brought Persian and other non-Greek peoples into his military and even the elite cavalry units of the [[companion cavalry]]. Again, it is probably better to see these policies as a pragmatic response to the demands of ruling a large empire<ref name=\"Green, p. 21\"/> than to any idealized attempt to bringing [[Greek culture]] to the '[[barbarians]]'. This approach was bitterly resented by the Macedonians and discarded by most of the Diadochi after Alexander's death. These policies can also be interpreted as the result of Alexander's possible [[megalomania]]<ref name=\"Green, p. 23\">Green, p. 23.</ref> during his later years.\n\nAfter Alexander's death in 323&nbsp;BC, the influx of Greek colonists into the new realms continued to spread Greek culture into Asia. The founding of new cities and military colonies continued to be a major part of the Successors' struggle for control of any particular region, and these continued to be centers of cultural diffusion. The spread of Greek culture under the Successors seems mostly to have occurred with the spreading of Greeks themselves, rather than as an active policy.\n\nThroughout the Hellenistic world, these Greco-Macedonian colonists considered themselves by and large superior to the native \"barbarians\" and excluded most non-Greeks from the upper echelons of courtly and government life. Most of the native population was not Hellenized, had little access to Greek culture and often found themselves discriminated against by their Hellenic overlords.<ref>Green (1990), p. 313.</ref> [[Gymnasiums]] and their Greek education, for example, were for Greeks only. Greek cities and colonies may have exported Greek art and architecture as far as the [[Indus]], but these were mostly enclaves of Greek culture for the transplanted Greek [[elite]]. The degree of influence that Greek culture had throughout the Hellenistic kingdoms was therefore highly localized and based mostly on a few great cities like Alexandria and Antioch. Some natives did learn Greek and adopt Greek ways, but this was mostly limited to a few local elites who were allowed to retain their posts by the Diadochi and also to a small number of mid-level administrators who acted as intermediaries between the Greek speaking upper class and their subjects. In the Seleucid Empire, for example, this group amounted to only 2.5 percent of the [[official]] class.<ref>Green (1990), p. 315.</ref>\n\n[[Hellenistic art]] nevertheless had a considerable influence on the cultures that had been affected by the Hellenistic expansion. As far as the Indian subcontinent, [[Hellenistic influence on Indian art]] was broad and far-reaching, and had effects for several centuries following the forays of Alexander the Great.\n\nDespite their initial reluctance, the Successors seem to have later deliberately naturalized themselves to their different regions, presumably in order to help maintain control of the population.<ref>Green, p. 22.</ref> In the Ptolemaic kingdom, we find some Egyptianized Greeks by the 2nd century onwards. In the [[Indo-Greek kingdom]] we find kings who were converts to [[Buddhism]] (e.g., [[Menander I|Menander]]). The Greeks in the regions therefore gradually become 'localized', adopting local customs as appropriate. In this way, hybrid 'Hellenistic' cultures naturally emerged, at least among the upper echelons of society.\n\nThe trends of Hellenization were therefore accompanied by Greeks adopting native ways over time, but this was widely varied by place and by social class. The farther away from the Mediterranean and the lower in social status, the more likely that a colonist was to adopt local ways, while the Greco-Macedonian elites and royal families usually remained thoroughly Greek and viewed most non-Greeks with disdain. It was not until [[Cleopatra&nbsp;VII]] that a Ptolemaic ruler bothered to learn the [[Egyptian language]] of their subjects.\n\n===Religion===\n{{Main|Hellenistic religion}}\n[[File:Zeus Ammon (Antikensammlung M\u00fcnchen).jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Bust of [[Amun#Greece|Zeus-Ammon]], a deity with attributes from Greek and Egyptian gods.]]\nIn the Hellenistic period, there was much continuity in [[Ancient Greek religion|Greek religion]]: the [[Greek gods]] continued to be worshiped, and the same rites were practiced as before. However the socio-political changes brought on by the conquest of the Persian empire and Greek emigration abroad meant that change also came to religious practices. This varied greatly by location. Athens, Sparta and most cities in the Greek mainland did not see much religious change or new gods (with the exception of the Egyptian [[Isis]] in Athens),<ref>Bugh, pp. 206\u2013210.</ref> while the multi-ethnic Alexandria had a very varied group of gods and religious practices, including Egyptian, Jewish and Greek. Greek emigres brought their Greek religion everywhere they went, even as far as India and Afghanistan. Non-Greeks also had more freedom to travel and trade throughout the Mediterranean and in this period we can see Egyptian gods such as [[Serapis]], and the [[Greater Syria|Syria]]n gods [[Atargatis]] and [[Hadad]], as well as a Jewish [[synagogue]], all coexisting on the island of [[Delos]] alongside classical Greek deities.<ref>Bugh, p. 209.</ref> A common practice was to identify Greek gods with native gods that had similar characteristics and this created new fusions like Zeus-Ammon, [[Aphrodite]] Hagne (a Hellenized [[Atargatis]]) and [[Isis]]-[[Demeter]]. Greek emigres faced individual religious choices they had not faced on their home cities, where the gods they worshiped were dictated by tradition.\n[[File:Cybele Getty Villa 57.AA.19.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Cybele]], a [[Phrygia]]n mother Goddess, enthroned, with [[lion]], [[cornucopia]] and [[Mural crown]].]]\n\nHellenistic monarchies were closely associated with the religious life of the kingdoms they ruled. This had already been a feature of Macedonian kingship, which had priestly duties.<ref>Wallbank et al. (2008), p. 84.</ref> Hellenistic kings adopted patron deities as protectors of their house and sometimes claimed descent from them. The Seleucids for example took on [[Apollo]] as patron, the Antigonids had [[Herakles]], and the Ptolemies claimed [[Dionysus]] among others.<ref>Wallbank et al. (2008), p. 86.</ref>\n\nThe worship of dynastic ruler cults was also a feature of this period, most notably in Egypt, where the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]] adopted earlier Pharaonic practice, and established themselves as [[god-kings]]. These cults were usually associated with a specific temple in honor of the ruler such as the ''Ptolemaieia'' at Alexandria and had their own festivals and theatrical performances. The setting up of ruler cults was more based on the systematized honors offered to the kings (sacrifice, [[proskynesis]], statues, altars, hymns) which put them on par with the gods (''isotheism'') than on actual belief of their divine nature. According to Peter Green, these cults did not produce genuine belief of the divinity of rulers among the Greeks and Macedonians.<ref>Green (1990), p. 402.</ref> The worship of Alexander was also popular, as in the long lived cult at [[Erythrae]] and of course, at Alexandria, where his tomb was located.\n\nThe Hellenistic age also saw a rise in the disillusionment with traditional religion.<ref>Green (1990), p. 396.</ref> The rise of philosophy and the sciences had removed the gods from many of their traditional domains such as their role in the movement of the heavenly bodies and natural disasters. The [[Sophists]] proclaimed the centrality of humanity and [[agnosticism]]; the belief in [[Euhemerism]] (the view that the gods were simply ancient kings and heroes), became popular. The popular philosopher [[Epicurus]] promoted a [[Epicureanism#Religion|view of disinterested gods]] living far away from the human realm in [[metakosmia]]. The [[apotheosis]] of rulers also brought the idea of divinity down to earth. While there does seem to have been a substantial decline in religiosity, this was mostly reserved for the educated classes.<ref>Green (1990), p. 399.</ref>\n\n[[Magic in the Greco-Roman world|Magic]] was practiced widely, and this, too, was a continuation from earlier times. Throughout the Hellenistic world, people would consult [[oracle]]s, and use [[Amulet|charms]] and figurines to deter misfortune or to cast spells. Also developed in this era was the complex system of [[Hellenistic astrology|astrology]], which sought to determine a person's character and future in the movements of the [[sun]], [[moon]], and [[planets]]. Astrology was widely associated with the cult of [[Tyche]] (luck, fortune), which grew in popularity during this period.\n\n===Literature===\n[[File:Relief with Menander and New Comedy Masks - Princeton Art Museum.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Relief with Menander and New Comedy Masks (Roman, AD&nbsp;40\u201360). The masks show three New Comedy stock characters: youth, false maiden, old man. [[Princeton University Art Museum]]]]\nThe Hellenistic period saw the rise of [[New Comedy]], the only few surviving representative texts being those of [[Menander]] (born 342/341&nbsp;BC). Only one play, ''[[Dyskolos]]'', survives in its entirety. The plots of this new Hellenistic [[comedy of manners]] were more domestic and formulaic, stereotypical low born characters such as slaves became more important, the language was colloquial and major motifs included [[escapism]], marriage, romance and luck ([[Tyche]]).<ref>Green (1990), page 66-74.</ref> Though no Hellenistic tragedy remains intact, they were still widely produced during the period, yet it seems that there was no major breakthrough in style, remaining within the classical model. The ''Supplementum Hellenisticum'', a modern collection of extant fragments, contains the fragments of 150 authors.<ref>Green (1990), page 65.</ref>\n\n[[Hellenistic poetry|Hellenistic poets]] now sought patronage from kings, and wrote works in their honor. The scholars at the libraries in Alexandria and Pergamon focused on the collection, cataloging, and [[literary criticism]] of classical Athenian works and ancient Greek myths. The poet-critic [[Callimachus]], a staunch elitist, wrote hymns equating Ptolemy&nbsp;II to Zeus and Apollo. He promoted short poetic forms such as the [[epigram]], [[epyllion]] and the [[Iambus (genre)|iambic]] and attacked epic as base and common (\"big book, big evil\" was his doctrine).<ref>Green (1990), p. 179.</ref> He also wrote a massive catalog of the holdings of the library of Alexandria, the famous [[Pinakes]]. Callimachus was extremely influential in his time and also for the development of [[Augustan poetry]]. Another poet, [[Apollonius of Rhodes]], attempted to revive the epic for the Hellenistic world with his [[Argonautica]]. He had been a student of Callimachus and later became chief librarian (''prostates'') of the library of Alexandria. Apollonius and Callimachus spent much of their careers feuding with each other. [[Pastoral poetry]] also thrived during the Hellenistic era, [[Theocritus]] was a major poet who popularized the genre.\n\nThis period also saw the rise of the [[Ancient Greek novel]], such as [[Daphnis and Chloe]] and the [[Ephesian Tale]].\n\nAround 240&nbsp;BC Livius Andronicus, a Greek slave from southern Italy, translated Homer's ''Odyssey'' into Latin. Greek literature would have a dominant effect on the development of the [[Latin literature]] of the Romans. The poetry of [[Virgil]], [[Horace]] and [[Ovid]] were all based on Hellenistic styles.\n\n===Philosophy===\n[[File:Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico (Napoli, 1969) - BEIC 6353768.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Zeno of Citium]] founded [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosophy.]]\n{{Main|Hellenistic philosophy}}\nDuring the Hellenistic period, many different schools of thought developed, and these schools of Hellenistic philosophy had a significant influence on the Greek and Roman ruling elite. \n\nAthens, with its multiple philosophical schools, continued to remain the center of philosophical thought. However, Athens had now lost her political freedom, and Hellenistic philosophy is a reflection of this new difficult period. In this political climate, Hellenistic philosophers went in search of goals such as [[ataraxia]] (un-disturbedness), [[autarky]] (self-sufficiency), and [[apatheia]] (freedom from suffering), which would allow them to wrest well-being or [[eudaimonia]] out of the most difficult turns of fortune. This occupation with the inner life, with personal inner liberty and with the pursuit of [[eudaimonia]] is what all Hellenistic philosophical schools have in common.<ref>Green, Peter; Alexander to Actium, the historical evolution of the Hellenistic age, page 53.</ref>\n\nThe [[Epicureans]] and the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]] eschewed public offices and civic service, which amounted to a rejection of the [[polis]] itself, the defining institution of the Greek world. [[Epicurus]] promoted [[atomism]] and an [[asceticism]] based on freedom from pain as its ultimate goal. Cynics such as [[Diogenes of Sinope]] rejected all material possessions and social conventions (''nomos'') as unnatural and useless. The [[Cyrenaics]], meanwhile, embraced [[hedonism]], arguing that pleasure was the only true good. [[Stoicism]], founded by [[Zeno of Citium]], taught that [[virtue]] was sufficient for [[eudaimonia]] as it would allow one to live in accordance with Nature or [[Logos]]. The philosophical schools of [[Aristotle]] (the [[Peripatetics]] of the [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]]) and [[Plato]] ([[Platonism]] at the [[Platonic Academy|Academy]]) also remained influential. Against these [[dogma|dogmatic]] schools of philosophy the [[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonist]] school embraced [[philosophical skepticism]], and, starting with [[Arcesilaus]], Plato's Academy also embraced skepticism in the form of [[Academic Skepticism]]. \n\nThe spread of [[Christianity]] throughout the Roman world, followed by the [[spread of Islam]], ushered in the end of Hellenistic philosophy and the beginnings of [[Medieval philosophy]] (often forcefully, as under [[Justinian I#Suppression of religions|Justinian&nbsp;I]]), which was dominated by the three [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] traditions: [[Jewish philosophy]], [[Christian philosophy]], and [[early Islamic philosophy]]. In spite of this shift, Hellenistic philosophy continued to influence these three religious traditions and the [[Renaissance]] thought which followed them.\n\n===Sciences===\n\n[[File:Oxyrhynchus papyrus with Euclid's Elements.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.05|One of the oldest surviving fragments of Euclid's ''Elements'', found at [[Oxyrhynchus]] and dated to {{circa|AD&nbsp;100}} ([[Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 29|P.

Hellenistic science differed from Greek science in at least two ways: first, it benefited from the cross-fertilization of Greek ideas with those that had developed in the larger Hellenistic world; secondly, to some extent, it was supported by royal patrons in the kingdoms founded by Alexander's successors. Especially important to Hellenistic science was the city of Alexandria in Egypt, which became a major center of scientific research in the 3rd century BC.

Armies of the Hellenistic period differed from those of the classical period in being largely made up of professional soldiers and also in their greater specialization and technical proficiency in [[siege warfare]]. Hellenistic armies were significantly larger than those of classical Greece relying increasingly on Greek [[mercenaries]] (''misthophoroi''; men-for-pay) and also on non-Greek soldiery such as Thracians, Galatians, Egyptians and Iranians. Some ethnic groups were known for their martial skill in a particular mode of combat and were highly sought after, including [[Hellenistic armies#Tarantine cavalry|Tarantine cavalry]], Cretan archers, Rhodian slingers and Thracian [[peltasts]]. This period also saw the adoption of new weapons and troop types such as [[Thureophoroi]] and the [[Thorakitai]] who used the oval [[Thureos]] shield and fought with javelins and the [[machaira]] sword. The use of heavily armored [[cataphracts]] and also [[horse archers]] was adopted by the Seleucids, Greco-Bactrians, Armenians and [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontus]]. The use of [[war elephants]] also became common. Seleucus received Indian war elephants from the [[Mauryan empire]], and used them to good effect at the [[battle of Ipsus]]. He kept a core of 500 of them at [[Apamea (Euphrates)|Apameia]]. The Ptolemies used the smaller African elephant.\n[[File:Ancient Mechanical Artillery. Pic 01.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Ancient mechanical artillery: Catapults (standing), the chain drive of [[Polybolos]] (bottom center), [[Gastraphetes]] (on wall)]]\nHellenistic military equipment was generally characterized by an increase in size. [[Hellenistic-era warships]] grew from the [[trireme]] to include more banks of oars and larger numbers of rowers and soldiers as in the Quadrireme and Quinquereme. The Ptolemaic [[Tessarakonteres]] was the largest ship constructed in Antiquity. New siege engines were developed during this period. An unknown engineer developed the torsion-spring catapult ({{circa|360&nbsp;BC}}) and Dionysios of Alexandria designed a repeating [[ballista]], the [[Polybolos]].

In artistic terms this means that there is huge variety which is often put under the heading of \"Hellenistic Art\" for convenience.\n\nHellenistic art saw a turn from the idealistic, perfected, calm and composed figures of classical Greek art to a style dominated by [[Realism (arts)|realism]] and the depiction of emotion ([[pathos]]) and character ([[ethos]]). The motif of deceptively realistic [[Naturalism (arts)|naturalism]] in art (''aletheia'') is reflected in stories such as that of the painter [[Zeuxis]], who was said to have painted grapes that seemed so real that birds came and pecked at them.<ref>Green, Peter; Alexander to Actium, the historical evolution of the Hellenistic age, page 92.</ref> The [[female nude]] also became more popular as epitomized by the [[Aphrodite of Cnidos]] of [[Praxiteles]] and art in general became more erotic (e.g., [[Leda and the Swan#Eroticism|Leda and the Swan]] and [[Scopas#Pothos|Scopa's Pothos]]). The dominant ideals of Hellenistic art were those of sensuality and passion.<ref>Green (1990), p. 342.</ref>\n\nPeople of all ages and social statuses were depicted in the art of the Hellenistic age. Artists such as [[Peiraikos]] chose mundane and lower class subjects for his paintings. According to Pliny, \"He painted barbers' shops, cobblers' stalls, asses, eatables and similar subjects, earning for himself the name of ''rhyparographos'' [painter of dirt/low things]. In these subjects he could give consummate pleasure, selling them for more than other artists received for their large pictures\" ([[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]], Book XXXV.112). Even barbarians, such as the [[Galatia (Roman province)|Galatians]], were depicted in heroic form, prefiguring the artistic theme of the [[noble savage]]. The image of Alexander the Great was also an important artistic theme, and all of the diadochi had themselves depicted imitating Alexander's youthful look. A number of the best-known works of Greek sculpture belong to the Hellenistic period, including [[Laoco\u00f6n and his Sons]], [[Venus de Milo]], and the [[Winged Victory of Samothrace]].\n\nDevelopments in painting included experiments in [[chiaroscuro]] by [[Zeuxis]] and the development of [[landscape painting]] and [[still life]] painting.<ref>Green, Peter; Alexander to Actium, the historical evolution of the Hellenistic age, page 117\u2013118.</ref> Greek temples built during the Hellenistic period were generally larger than classical ones, such as the [[temple of Artemis]] at Ephesus, the temple of [[Artemis]] at [[Sardis]], and the temple of Apollo at Didyma (rebuilt by Seleucus in 300&nbsp;BC). The royal palace (''basileion'') also came into its own during the Hellenistic period, the first extant example being the massive 4th-century villa of Cassander at [[Vergina]].\n\nThis period also saw the first written works of [[art history]] in the histories of [[Duris of Samos]] and [[Xenocrates of Athens]], a sculptor and a historian of sculpture and painting.\n\nThere has been a trend in writing the history of this period to depict Hellenistic art as a decadent style, following the ''Golden Age'' of [[Classical Greece|Classical Athens]]. [[Pliny the Elder]], after having described the [[Greek sculpture|sculpture]] of the classical period, says: ''Cessavit deinde ars'' (\"then art disappeared\").<ref>[[Pliny the Elder]], ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' (XXXIV, 52)</ref> The 18th century terms ''[[Baroque]]'' and ''[[Rococo]]'' have sometimes been applied to the art of this complex and individual period. The renewal of the historiographical approach as well as some recent discoveries, such as the tombs of [[Vergina]], allow a better appreciation of this period's artistic richness.\n\n==Hellenistic period and modern culture==\n{{Further|Decadence|Degeneration}}\nThe focus on the Hellenistic period over the course of the 19th century by scholars and historians has led to an issue common to the study of historical periods; historians see the period of focus as a mirror of the period in which they are living. Many 19th-century scholars contended that the Hellenistic period represented a cultural decline from the brilliance of [[classical Greece]]. Though this comparison is now seen as unfair and meaningless, it has been noted that even commentators of the time saw the end of a cultural era which could not be matched again.<ref>Green, p. xv.</ref> This may be inextricably linked with the nature of government. It has been noted by [[Herodotus]] that after the establishment of the Athenian democracy:\n\n<blockquote>...the Athenians found themselves suddenly a great power. Not just in one field, but in everything they set their minds to...As subjects of a tyrant, what had they accomplished?...Held down like slaves they had shirked and slacked; once they had won their freedom, not a citizen but he could feel like he was labouring for himself\"<ref>Herodotus (Holland, T. ''Persian Fire'', p. 193.)</ref></blockquote>\n\nThus, with the decline of the Greek polis, and the establishment of monarchical states, the environment and social freedom in which to excel may have been reduced.<ref name=\"Green\">Green.</ref> A parallel can be drawn with the productivity of the city states of Italy during [[the Renaissance]], and their subsequent decline under autocratic rulers.\n\nHowever, [[William Woodthorpe Tarn]], between [[World War&nbsp;I]] and [[World War&nbsp;II]] and the heyday of the [[League of Nations]], focused on the issues of racial and cultural confrontation and the nature of colonial rule. [[Michael Rostovtzeff]], who fled the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], concentrated predominantly on the rise of the capitalist bourgeoisie in areas of Greek rule. [[Arnaldo Momigliano]], an [[Italian Jew]] who wrote before and after the Second World War, studied the problem of mutual understanding between races in the conquered areas. [[Moses Hadas]] portrayed an optimistic picture of synthesis of culture from the perspective of the 1950s, while [[Frank William Walbank]] in the 1960s and 1970s had a materialistic approach to the Hellenistic period, focusing mainly on class relations.

The Hellenistic period may be seen to end either with the final conquest of the Greek heartlands by [[Roman Republic|Rome]] in 146&nbsp;BC following the [[Achaean War]], with the final defeat of the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]] at the [[Battle of Actium]] in 31&nbsp;BC, or even the move by [[Roman emperor]] [[Constantine the Great]] of the capital of the [[Roman Empire]] to [[Constantinople]] in AD&nbsp;330.<ref name=eb>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/260307/Hellenistic-Age |title=Hellenistic Age |encyclopedia=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]] |publisher=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.]] |accessdate=8 September 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{cite book |title=Alexander The Great and the Hellenistic Age |page=xiii |last=Green |first=P |isbn=978-0-7538-2413-9|year=2008 }}</ref> \"Hellenistic\" is distinguished from \"Hellenic\" in that the first encompasses the entire sphere of direct ancient Greek influence, while the latter refers to [[Hellenistic Greece|Greece itself]].\n\n==Etymology==\n{{See also|Names of the Greeks}}\nThe word originated from the [[German language|German]] term ''hellenistisch'', from Ancient Greek {{lang|grc|\u1f19\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2}} (''Hell\u0113nist\u1e17s'', \"one who uses the Greek language\"), from {{lang|grc|\u1f19\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03c2}} (''Hell\u00e1s'', \"Greece\"); as if \"Hellenist\" + \"ic\".\n{{multiple image| align = right | direction = horizontal | header = | header_align = left/right/center | footer = '''Left image''': The [[Sampul tapestry]], a woolen wall hanging from [[Lop County]], [[Hotan Prefecture]], [[Xinjiang]], [[China]], showing a possibly [[Hellenistic civilization|Greek soldier]] from the [[Greco-Bactrian kingdom]] (250\u2013125&nbsp;BC), with [[blue eyes]], wielding a spear, and wearing what appears to be a ''[[diadem]]'' headband; depicted above him is a [[centaur]], from [[Greek mythology]], a common [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]] in [[Hellenistic art]]<br/> '''Right image''': painted clay and [[alabaster]] head of a [[Zoroastrian]] priest wearing a distinctive [[Bactria]]n-style headdress, [[Takhti-Sangin]], [[Tajikistan]], 3rd\u20132nd century&nbsp;BC | footer_align = left | image1 = UrumqiWarrior.jpg | width1 = 110 | caption1  = | image2 = BactrianZoroastrian.jpg | width2 = 180| caption2  = }}\n\"Hellenistic\" is a modern word and a 19th-century concept; the idea of a Hellenistic period did not exist in [[Ancient Greece]].

Some areas of the conquered world were more affected by Greek influences than others. The term Hellenistic also implies that the Greek populations were of majority in the areas in which they settled, but in many cases, the Greek settlers were actually the minority among the native populations. The Greek population and the native population did not always mix; the Greeks moved and brought their own culture, but interaction did not always occur.\n\n==Sources==\nWhile a few fragments exist, there is no complete surviving historical work which dates to the hundred years following Alexander's death. The works of the major Hellenistic [[historians]] [[Hieronymus of Cardia]] (who worked under Alexander, [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus|Antigonus&nbsp;I]] and other successors), [[Duris of Samos]] and [[Phylarchus]] which were used by surviving [[Primary source|sources]] are all lost.<ref name=\"Walbank\">F.W. Walbank et al. THE CAMBRIDGE ANCIENT HISTORY, SECOND EDITION, VOLUME VII, PART I: The Hellenistic World, p. 1.</ref> The earliest and most credible surviving source for the Hellenistic period is [[Polybius]] of [[Megalopolis, Greece|Megalopolis]] (c. 200\u2013118), a statesman of the [[Achaean League]] until 168&nbsp;BC when he was forced to go to Rome as a hostage.<ref name=\"Walbank\"/> His ''[[The Histories (Polybius)|Histories]]'' eventually grew to a length of forty books, covering the years 220 to 167&nbsp;BC.\n\nThe most important source after Polybius is [[Diodorus Siculus]] who wrote his ''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'' between 60 and 30&nbsp;BC and reproduced some important earlier sources such as Hieronymus, but his account of the Hellenistic period breaks off after the [[battle of Ipsus]] (301&nbsp;BC). Another important source, [[Plutarch]]'s ({{circa|AD&nbsp;50|120}}) ''[[Parallel Lives]]'' although more preoccupied with issues of personal character and morality, outlines the history of important Hellenistic figures. [[Appian]] of Alexandria (late 1st century AD\u2013before 165) wrote a history of the [[Roman empire]] that includes information of some Hellenistic kingdoms.\n\nOther sources include [[Justin (historian)|Justin]]'s (2nd century AD) [[epitome]] of [[Pompeius Trogus]]' ''Historiae Philipicae'' and a summary of [[Arrian]]'s ''Events after Alexander'', by [[Photios&nbsp;I of Constantinople]]. Lesser supplementary sources include [[Curtius Rufus]], [[Pausanias of Damascus|Pausanias]], [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], and the [[Byzantine]] [[encyclopedia]] the [[Suda]]. In the field of philosophy, [[Diogenes La\u00ebrtius]]' ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]'' is the main source; works such as [[Cicero]]'s ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'' also provide some further detail of philosophical schools in the Hellenistic period.\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|Philip II of Macedon|Alexander the Great|Wars of Alexander the Great}}\n[[File:Napoli BW 2013-05-16 16-24-01.jpg|left|thumb|[[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] fighting the Persian king [[Darius III of Persia|Darius&nbsp;III]]. From the [[Alexander Mosaic]], [[Naples National Archaeological Museum]].]]\nAncient Greece had traditionally been a fractious collection of fiercely independent city-states. After the [[Peloponnesian War]] (431&ndash;404&nbsp;BC), Greece had fallen under a [[Spartan hegemony]], in which [[Sparta]] was pre-eminent but not all-powerful. Spartan hegemony was succeeded by a [[Thebes (Greece)|Theban]] [[Theban hegemony|hegemony]] after the [[Battle of Leuctra]] (371&nbsp;BC), but after the [[Battle of Mantinea (362&nbsp;BC)]], all of Greece was so weakened that no one state could claim pre-eminence. It was against this backdrop that the ascendancy of [[Macedon]] began, under king [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip&nbsp;II]]. Macedon was located at the periphery of the Greek world, and although its royal family claimed Greek descent, the Macedonians themselves were looked down upon as semi-barbaric by the rest of the Greeks. However, Macedon had a relatively strong and centralized government, and compared to most Greek states, directly controlled a large area.\n\nPhilip&nbsp;II was a strong and expansionist king and he took every opportunity to expand Macedonian territory. In 352&nbsp;BC he annexed [[Thessaly]] and [[Magnesia Prefecture|Magnesia]]. In 338&nbsp;BC, Philip defeated a combined Theban and Athenian army at the [[Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)|Battle of Chaeronea]] after a decade of desultory conflict. In the aftermath, Philip formed the [[League of Corinth]], effectively bringing the majority of Greece under his direct sway. He was elected ''Hegemon'' of the league, and a campaign against the [[Achaemenid Empire]] of Persia was planned. However, while this campaign was in its early stages, he was assassinated.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n[[File:MacedonEmpire.jpg|thumb|right|Alexander's empire at the time of its maximum expansion.]]\nSucceeding his father, Alexander took over the Persian war himself. During a decade of campaigning, Alexander [[Wars of Alexander the Great|conquered the whole Persian Empire]], overthrowing the Persian king [[Darius&nbsp;III]]. The conquered lands included [[Asia Minor]], [[Assyria]], the [[Levant]], [[Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Medes|Media]], [[Persia]], and parts of modern-day [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], and the [[steppes]] of central Asia. The years of constant campaigning had taken their toll however, and Alexander died in 323&nbsp;BC.\n\nAfter his death, the huge territories Alexander had conquered became subject to a strong Greek influence ([[Hellenization]]) for the next two or three centuries, until the rise of [[Roman Empire|Rome]] in the west, and of [[Parthian Empire|Parthia]] in the east. As the Greek and Levantine cultures mingled, the development of a hybrid [[Hellenistic civilisation|Hellenistic culture]] began, and persisted even when isolated from the main centres of Greek culture (for instance, in the [[Greco-Bactrian kingdom]]).\n\nIt can be argued that some of the changes across the [[Macedonian Empire]] after Alexander's conquests and during the rule of the [[Diadochi]] would have occurred without the influence of Greek rule. As mentioned by [[Peter Green (historian)|Peter Green]], numerous factors of conquest have been merged under the term [[Hellenistic Period]]. Specific areas conquered by Alexander's invading army, including Egypt and areas of [[Asia Minor]] and [[Mesopotamia]] \"fell\" willingly to conquest and viewed Alexander as more of a liberator than a conqueror.<ref name=\"autogenerated2007\"/>\n\nIn addition, much of the area conquered would continue to be ruled by the [[Diadochi]], Alexander's generals and successors. Initially the whole empire was divided among them; however, some territories were lost relatively quickly, or only remained nominally under Macedonian rule. After 200 years, only much reduced and rather degenerate states remained,<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> until the conquest of Ptolemaic Egypt by Rome.\n\n==The Diadochi==\n{{Main|Diadochi|Wars of the Diadochi|Partition of Babylon}}\n{{further information|History of Macedonia (ancient kingdom)}}\n[[File:Diadochi satraps babylon.png|thumb|upright=1.15|The distribution of [[satrap]]ies in the [[Macedonian Empire]] after the [[Partition of Babylon|Settlement in Babylon (323&nbsp;BC)]].]]\n\nWhen Alexander the Great died (10 June 323&nbsp;BC), he left behind a huge empire which was composed of many essentially autonomous territories called [[satrap]]s. Without a chosen successor there were immediate disputes among his generals as to who should be king of Macedon. These generals became known as the Diadochi ({{lang-grc-gre|\u0394\u03b9\u03ac\u03b4\u03bf\u03c7\u03bf\u03b9}}, ''Diadokhoi'', meaning \"Successors\").\n\n[[Meleager (general)|Meleager]] and the infantry supported the candidacy of Alexander's half-brother, [[Philip III of Macedon|Philip Arrhidaeus]], while [[Perdiccas]], the leading cavalry commander, supported waiting until the birth of Alexander's child by [[Roxana]]. After the infantry stormed the palace of [[Babylon]], a compromise was arranged &ndash; [[Arrhidaeus]] (as Philip&nbsp;III) should become king, and should rule jointly with Roxana's child, assuming that it was a boy (as it was, becoming [[Alexander IV of Macedon|Alexander&nbsp;IV]]). Perdiccas himself would become regent (''epimeletes'') of the empire, and Meleager his lieutenant. Soon, however, Perdiccas had Meleager and the other infantry leaders murdered, and assumed full control.<ref>Green, Peter (1990); Alexander to Actium, the historical evolution of the Hellenistic age. University of California Press. Pages 7-8.</ref> The generals who had supported Perdiccas were rewarded in the [[partition of Babylon]] by becoming [[satrap]]s of the various parts of the empire, but Perdiccas' position was shaky, because, as [[Arrian]] writes, \"everyone was suspicious of him, and he of them\".<ref>Green (1990), page 9.</ref>\n\nThe first of the [[Diadochi wars]] broke out when [[Perdiccas]] planned to marry Alexander's sister [[Cleopatra of Macedonia|Cleopatra]] and began to question [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus]]' leadership in [[Asia Minor]]. Antigonus fled for Greece, and then, together with [[Antipater]] and [[Craterus]] (the satrap of [[Cilicia]] who had been in Greece fighting the [[Lamian war]]) invaded [[Anatolia]]. The rebels were supported by [[Lysimachus]], the satrap of [[Thrace]] and Ptolemy, the satrap of Egypt. Although [[Eumenes]], satrap of [[Cappadocia]], defeated the rebels in Asia Minor, Perdiccas himself was murdered by his own generals [[Peithon]], [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]], and [[Antigenes (general)|Antigenes]] (possibly with Ptolemy's aid) during his invasion of Egypt ({{circa|21 May}} to 19 June, 320&nbsp;BC).<ref>Green (1990), page 14.</ref> Ptolemy came to terms with Perdiccas's murderers, making Peithon and [[Arrhidaeus]] regents in his place, but soon these came to a new agreement with Antipater at the [[Treaty of Triparadisus]]. Antipater was made regent of the Empire, and the two kings were moved to Macedon. Antigonus remained in charge of Asia Minor, Ptolemy retained Egypt, Lysimachus retained Thrace and [[Seleucus&nbsp;I]] controlled [[Babylon]].\n\nThe second Diadochi war began following the death of [[Antipater]] in 319&nbsp;BC. Passing over his own son, [[Cassander]], Antipater had declared [[Polyperchon]] his successor as [[Regent]]. Cassander rose in revolt against Polyperchon (who was joined by Eumenes) and was supported by Antigonus, Lysimachus and Ptolemy. In 317&nbsp;BC, [[Cassander]] invaded Macedonia, attaining control of Macedon, sentencing [[Olympias]] to death and capturing the boy king [[Alexander IV of Macedon|Alexander&nbsp;IV]], and his mother. In Asia, [[Eumenes]] was betrayed by his own men after years of campaign and was given up to Antigonus who had him executed.\n\n[[File:Diadoch.png|upright=1.15|thumb|right|The Kingdoms of Antigonos and his rivals {{circa|303&nbsp;BC}}.]]\nThe third war of the Diadochi broke out because of the growing power and ambition of Antigonus. He began removing and appointing satraps as if he were king and also raided the royal treasuries in [[Ecbatana]], [[Persepolis]] and [[Susa]], making off with 25,000 [[Talent (measurement)|talents]].<ref>Green (1990), page 21.</ref> Seleucus was forced to flee to Egypt and Antigonus was soon at war with Ptolemy, Lysimachus, and Cassander. He then invaded [[Phoenicia]], laid siege to [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], stormed [[Gaza City|Gaza]] and began building a fleet. Ptolemy invaded Syria and defeated Antigonus' son, [[Demetrius I of Macedon|Demetrius Poliorcetes]], in the [[Battle of Gaza (312 BC)|Battle of Gaza]] of 312&nbsp;BC which allowed [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]] to secure control of [[Babylonia]], and the eastern satrapies. In 310&nbsp;BC, Cassander had young King Alexander&nbsp;IV and his mother [[Roxana]] murdered, ending the [[Argead Dynasty]] which had ruled Macedon for several centuries.\n\nAntigonus then sent his son [[Demetrius I Poliorcetes|Demetrius]] to regain control of Greece. In 307&nbsp;BC he took Athens, expelling [[Demetrius of Phaleron]], Cassander's governor, and proclaiming the city free again. Demetrius now turned his attention to Ptolemy, defeating his fleet at the [[Battle of Salamis in Cyprus (306 BC)|Battle of Salamis]] and taking control of Cyprus. In the aftermath of this victory, Antigonus took the title of king (''[[basileus]]'') and bestowed it on his son [[Demetrius Poliorcetes]], the rest of the Diadochi soon followed suit.<ref>Green (1990), page 30\u201331.</ref> Demetrius continued his campaigns by [[Siege of Rhodes (305 BC)|laying siege to Rhodes]] and conquering most of Greece in 302&nbsp;BC, creating a league against Cassander's Macedon.\n\nThe decisive engagement of the war came when Lysimachus invaded and overran much of western Anatolia, but was soon isolated by Antigonus and Demetrius near Ipsus in [[Phrygia]]. Seleucus arrived in time to save Lysimachus and utterly crushed Antigonus at the [[Battle of Ipsus]] in 301&nbsp;BC. Seleucus' war elephants proved decisive, Antigonus was killed, and Demetrius fled back to Greece to attempt to preserve the remnants of his rule there by recapturing a rebellious Athens. Meanwhile, Lysimachus took over [[Ionia]], Seleucus took [[Cilicia]], and Ptolemy captured [[Cyprus]].\n[[File:Diadochen1.png|thumb|right|\n\nKingdoms of the Diadochi after the battle of Ipsus, {{circa|301&nbsp;BC}}.\n{{legend|#787CAD|Kingdom of [[Ptolemy&nbsp;I Soter]]}}\n{{legend|#50A249|Kingdom of [[Cassander]]}}\n{{legend|#C38833|Kingdom of [[Lysimachus]]}}\n{{legend|#C3B933|Kingdom of [[Seleucus I Nicator]]}}\n]]\nAfter Cassander's death in {{circa|298&nbsp;BC}}, however, Demetrius, who still maintained a sizable loyal army and fleet, invaded Macedon, seized the Macedonian throne (294&nbsp;BC) and conquered [[Thessaly]] and most of central Greece (293\u2013291&nbsp;BC).<ref>Green (1990), page 126.</ref> He was defeated in 288&nbsp;BC when [[Lysimachus]] [[Thrace|of Thrace]] and [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]] invaded Macedon on two fronts, and quickly carved up the kingdom for themselves. Demetrius fled to central Greece with his mercenaries and began to build support there and in the northern Peloponnese. He once again laid siege to Athens after they turned on him, but then struck a treaty with the Athenians and Ptolemy, which allowed him to cross over to Asia Minor and wage war on Lysimachus' holdings in [[Ionia]], leaving his son [[Antigonus Gonatas]] in Greece.

Seleucus then attempted to conquer Lysimachus' European territories in Thrace and Macedon, but he was assassinated by [[Ptolemy Ceraunus]] (\"the thunderbolt\"), who had taken refuge at the Seleucid court and then had himself acclaimed as king of Macedon. Ptolemy was killed when Macedon was [[Celtic settlement of Eastern Europe#Invasions of Greece|invaded by Gauls in 279&nbsp;BC]]\u2014his head stuck on a spear\u2014and the country fell into anarchy. Antigonus II Gonatas invaded Thrace in the summer of 277 and defeated a large force of 18,000 Gauls. He was quickly hailed as king of Macedon and went on to rule for 35 years.<ref>Green (1990), page 134.</ref>\n\nAt this point the tripartite territorial division of the Hellenistic age was in place, with the main Hellenistic powers being [[Macedon]] under Demetrius's son [[Antigonus&nbsp;II Gonatas]], the [[Ptolemaic kingdom]] under the aged [[Ptolemy&nbsp;I]] and the [[Seleucid empire]] under Seleucus' son [[Antiochus&nbsp;I Soter]].\n\n==Southern Europe==\n\n===Kingdom of Epirus===\n{{Main|Epirus (ancient state)}}\n[[File:Pyrrhus and his Elephants.gif|right|thumb|upright=0.7|Pyrrhus and his elephants.]]\n[[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]] was a [[Doric Greek#Northwest Greek|northwestern Greek]] kingdom in the western [[Balkans]] ruled by the [[Molossian]] [[Aeacidae]] dynasty. Epirus was an ally of [[Macedon]] during the reigns of Philip&nbsp;II and Alexander.\n\nIn 281 [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]] (nicknamed \"the eagle\", ''aetos'') invaded southern Italy to aid the city state of [[History of Taranto|Tarentum]]. Pyrrhus defeated the Romans in the [[Battle of Heraclea]] and at the [[Battle of Asculum]]. Though victorious, he was forced to retreat due to heavy losses, hence the term \"[[Pyrrhic victory]]\". Pyrrhus then turned south and invaded Sicily but was unsuccessful and returned to Italy. After the [[Battle of Beneventum (275 BC)|Battle of Beneventum]] (275&nbsp;BC) Pyrrhus lost all his Italian holdings and left for Epirus.\n\n[[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]] then went to war with Macedonia in 275&nbsp;BC, deposing [[Antigonus&nbsp;II Gonatas]] and briefly ruling over Macedonia and [[Thessaly]] until 272. Afterwards he invaded southern Greece, and was killed in battle against [[Argos]] in 272&nbsp;BC. After the death of Pyrrhus, Epirus remained a minor power. In 233&nbsp;BC the Aeacid royal family was deposed and a federal state was set up called the [[Epirote League]]. The league was conquered by Rome in the [[Third Macedonian War]] (171\u2013168&nbsp;BC).\n\n===Kingdom of Macedon===\n{{Main|Antigonid dynasty}}\n[[File:Philip V of Macedon.jpg|thumb|right|[[Philip V of Macedon|Philip&nbsp;V]], \"''the darling of Hellas''\", wearing the [[Monarchy|royal]] [[diadem (personal wear)|diadem]].]] \n[[Antigonus&nbsp;II]], a student of [[Zeno of Citium]], spent most of his rule defending Macedon against [[Epirus]] and cementing Macedonian power in Greece, first against the Athenians in the [[Chremonidean War]], and then against the [[Achaean League]] of [[Aratus of Sicyon]]. Under the Antigonids, Macedonia was often short on funds, the [[Pangaion Hills|Pangaeum mines]] were no longer as productive as under Philip&nbsp;II, the wealth from Alexander's campaigns had been used up and the countryside pillaged by the [[Celtic settlement of Eastern Europe#Invasions of Greece|Gallic invasion]].<ref>Green (1990), p. 199</ref> A large number of the Macedonian population had also been resettled abroad by Alexander or had chosen to emigrate to the new eastern Greek cities. Up to two thirds of the population emigrated, and the Macedonian army could only count on a levy of 25,000 men, a significantly smaller force than under Philip&nbsp;II.<ref>Bugh, Glenn R. (editor). The Cambridge Companion to the Hellenistic World, 2007. p. 35</ref>\n\nAntigonus&nbsp;II ruled until his death in 239&nbsp;BC. His son [[Demetrius II of Macedon|Demetrius&nbsp;II]] soon died in 229&nbsp;BC, leaving a child (Philip&nbsp;V) as king, with the general [[Antigonus Doson]] as regent. Doson led Macedon to victory in the war against the Spartan king [[Cleomenes III]], and occupied [[Sparta]].\n\n[[Philip V of Macedon|Philip&nbsp;V]], who came to power when Doson died in 221&nbsp;BC, was the last Macedonian ruler with both the talent and the opportunity to unite Greece and preserve its independence against the \"cloud rising in the west\": the ever-increasing power of Rome. He was known as \"the darling of Hellas\". Under his auspices the Peace of Naupactus (217&nbsp;BC) brought the latest war between Macedon and the Greek leagues ([[Social War (220\u2013217 BC)|the Social War]] of 220\u2013217&nbsp;BC) to an end, and at this time he controlled all of Greece except Athens, Rhodes and Pergamum.\n\nIn 215&nbsp;BC Philip, with his eye on [[Illyria]], formed an alliance with Rome's enemy [[Hannibal]] of [[Carthage]], which led to Roman alliances with the [[Achaean League]], Rhodes and Pergamum. The [[First Macedonian War]] broke out in 212&nbsp;BC, and ended inconclusively in 205&nbsp;BC. Philip continued to wage war against Pergamum and Rhodes for control of the Aegean (204\u2013200&nbsp;BC) and ignored Roman demands for non-intervention in Greece by invading Attica. In 198&nbsp;BC, during the [[Second Macedonian War]] Philip was decisively defeated at [[Battle of Cynoscephalae|Cynoscephalae]] by the Roman proconsul [[Titus Quinctius Flamininus]] and Macedon lost all its territories in Greece proper. Southern Greece was now thoroughly brought into the Roman [[sphere of influence]], though it retained nominal autonomy. The end of Antigonid Macedon came when Philip&nbsp;V's son, Perseus, was defeated and captured by the Romans in the [[Third Macedonian War]] (171\u2013168&nbsp;BC).\n\n===Rest of Greece===\n{{Main|Hellenistic Greece}}\n[[File:Macedonia and the Aegean World c.200.png|upright=1.15|thumb|Greece and the Aegean World {{circa|200&nbsp;BC}}.]]\nDuring the Hellenistic period the importance of [[Greek peninsula|Greece proper]] within the Greek-speaking world declined sharply. The great centers of [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic culture]] were [[Alexandria]] and [[Antioch]], capitals of [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] and [[Seleucid dynasty|Seleucid Syria]] respectively. The conquests of Alexander greatly widened the horizons of the Greek world, making the endless conflicts between the cities which had marked the 5th and 4th centuries BC seem petty and unimportant. It led to a steady emigration, particularly of the young and ambitious, to the new Greek empires in the east. Many Greeks migrated to [[Alexandria]], [[Antioch]] and the many other new Hellenistic cities founded in Alexander's wake, as far away as modern [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]].\n\nIndependent city states were unable to compete with Hellenistic kingdoms and were usually forced to ally themselves to one of them for defense, giving honors to Hellenistic rulers in return for protection. One example is [[Athens]], which had been decisively defeated by [[Antipater]] in the [[Lamian war]] (323\u2013322&nbsp;BC) and had its port in the [[Piraeus]] garrisoned by Macedonian troops who supported a conservative [[oligarchy]].<ref>Green, Peter; Alexander to Actium, the historical evolution of the Hellenistic age, page 11.</ref> After [[Demetrius Poliorcetes]] captured Athens in 307&nbsp;BC and restored the [[Athenian democracy|democracy]], the Athenians honored him and his father Antigonus by placing gold statues of them on the [[agora]] and granting them the title of king. Athens later allied itself to [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] to throw off Macedonian rule, eventually setting up a religious cult for the Ptolemaic kings and naming one of the city's [[phyle]]s in honour of Ptolemy for his aid against Macedon. In spite of the Ptolemaic monies and fleets backing their endeavors, [[Athens]] and [[Sparta]] were defeated by [[Antigonus&nbsp;II]] during the [[Chremonidean War]] (267\u2013261&nbsp;BC). Athens was then occupied by Macedonian troops, and run by Macedonian officials.\n\n[[Sparta]] remained independent, but it was no longer the leading military power in the [[Peloponnese]]. The Spartan king [[Cleomenes&nbsp;III]] (235\u2013222&nbsp;BC) staged a military coup against the conservative [[ephors]] and pushed through radical social and land reforms in order to increase the size of the shrinking Spartan citizenry able to provide military service and restore Spartan power. Sparta's bid for supremacy was crushed at the [[Battle of Sellasia]] (222&nbsp;BC) by the Achaean league and Macedon, who restored the power of the [[ephors]].\n\nOther [[city states]] formed [[federated states]] in self-defense, such as the [[Aetolian League]] ({{abbr|est.|established}} 370&nbsp;BC), the [[Achaean League]] ({{abbr|est.|established}} 280&nbsp;BC), the [[Boeotian league]], the \"Northern League\" ([[Byzantium]], [[Chalcedon]], [[Heraclea Pontica]] and [[Tium]])<ref>McGing, BC. The Foreign Policy of Mithridates&nbsp;VI Eupator, King of Pontus, P. 17.</ref> and the \"[[Nesiotic League]]\" of the [[Cyclades]]. These [[federations]] involved a central government which controlled [[foreign policy]] and military affairs, while leaving most of the local governing to the city states, a system termed [[Sympoliteia (treaty)|sympoliteia]]. In states such as the Achaean league, this also involved the admission of other ethnic groups into the federation with equal rights, in this case, non-[[Achaeans (tribe)|Achaeans]].<ref>Green (1990), p. 139.</ref> The Achean league was able to drive out the Macedonians from the Peloponnese and free Corinth, which duly joined the league. \n[[File:Colosse de Rhodes (Barclay).jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|The [[Colossus of Rhodes]], one of the seven wonders of the ancient world.]]\nOne of the few city states who managed to maintain full independence from the control of any Hellenistic kingdom was [[Rhodes]]. With a skilled navy to protect its trade fleets from pirates and an ideal strategic position covering the routes from the east into the Aegean, Rhodes prospered during the Hellenistic period. It became a center of culture and commerce, its coins were widely circulated and its philosophical schools became one of the best in the Mediterranean. After holding out for [[Siege of Rhodes (305 BC)|one year under siege by Demetrius Poliorcetes]] (305\u2013304&nbsp;BC), the Rhodians built the [[Colossus of Rhodes]] to commemorate their victory. They retained their independence by the maintenance of a powerful navy, by maintaining a carefully neutral posture and acting to preserve the balance of power between the major Hellenistic kingdoms.<ref>[[Richard Berthold|Berthold, Richard M.]], ''Rhodes in the Hellenistic Age'', Cornell University Press, 1984, p. 12.</ref>\n\nInitially Rhodes had very close ties with the Ptolemaic kingdom. Rhodes later became a Roman ally against the Seleucids, receiving some territory in [[Caria]] for their role in the [[Roman\u2013Seleucid War]] (192\u2013188&nbsp;BC). Rome eventually turned on Rhodes and annexed the island as a Roman province.\n\n===Balkans===\n[[File:Thracian Tomb of Kazanlak.jpg|thumb|Painting of a groom and bride from the Hellenistic [[Thracian Tomb of Kazanlak]], near the ancient city of [[Seuthopolis]], 4th century BC.]] \nThe west [[Balkan]] coast was inhabited by various [[List of ancient tribes in Illyria|Illyrian]] tribes and kingdoms such as the kingdom of the [[Dalmatae]] and of the [[Ardiaei]], who often engaged in [[piracy]] under [[Queen Teuta]] (reigned 231\u2013227&nbsp;BC).

[[Alexandria]], a major center of Greek culture and trade, became his capital city. As Egypt's first port city, it was the main grain exporter in the Mediterranean.\n\nThe [[Egyptians]] begrudgingly accepted the Ptolemies as the successors to the [[pharaoh]]s of independent Egypt, though the kingdom went through several native revolts. The Ptolemies took on the traditions of the Egyptian [[Pharaohs]], such as marrying their siblings ([[Ptolemy&nbsp;II]] was the first to adopt this custom), having themselves portrayed on public monuments in Egyptian style and dress, and participating in Egyptian religious life. The Ptolemaic ruler cult portrayed the Ptolemies as gods, and temples to the Ptolemies were erected throughout the kingdom. Ptolemy I even created a new god, [[Serapis]], who was combination of two Egyptian gods: Apis and Osiris, with attributes of [[Greek gods]]. Ptolemaic administration was, like the Ancient Egyptian bureaucracy, highly centralized and focused on squeezing as much revenue out of the population as possible though tariffs, excise duties, fines, taxes and so forth. A whole class of petty officials, tax farmers, clerks and overseers made this possible.

His descendant, [[Attalus&nbsp;I]], defeated the invading [[Galatia]]ns and proclaimed himself an independent king. [[Attalus&nbsp;I]] (241\u2013197&nbsp;BC), was a staunch ally of Rome against [[Philip&nbsp;V of Macedon]] during the [[First Macedonian War|first]] and [[Second Macedonian War|second]] [[Macedonian Wars]]. For his support against the [[Seleucid dynasty|Seleucids]] in 190&nbsp;BC, [[Eumenes&nbsp;II]] was rewarded with all the former Seleucid domains in [[Asia Minor]]. Eumenes&nbsp;II turned Pergamon into a centre of culture and science by establishing the [[library of Pergamum]] which was said to be second only to the [[library of Alexandria]]<ref>{{cite book|title=Pergamum|website=Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th Edition, 1.}}</ref> with 200,000 volumes according to [[Plutarch]].

[[Capitoline Museums]], Rome.]]\nThe Celts who settled in [[Galatia]] came through [[Thrace]] under the leadership of Leotarios and [[Leonnorius|Leonnorios]] {{circa|270&nbsp;BC}}. They were defeated by [[Seleucus&nbsp;I]] in the 'battle of the Elephants', but were still able to establish a Celtic territory in central [[Anatolia]]. The Galatians were well respected as warriors and were widely used as mercenaries in the armies of the successor states. They continued to attack neighboring kingdoms such as [[Bithynia]] and [[Pergamon]], plundering and extracting tribute. This came to an end when they sided with the renegade Seleucid prince [[Antiochus Hierax]] who tried to defeat [[Attalus I|Attalus]], the ruler of [[Pergamon]] (241\u2013197&nbsp;BC). Attalus severely defeated the Gauls, forcing them to confine themselves to Galatia. The theme of the ''[[Dying Gaul]]'' (a famous statue displayed in [[Pergamon]]) remained a favorite in Hellenistic art for a generation signifying the victory of the Greeks over a noble enemy. In the early 2nd century BC, the Galatians became allies of [[Antiochus III|Antiochus the Great]], the last Seleucid king trying to regain suzerainty over Asia Minor. In 189&nbsp;BC, Rome sent [[Gnaeus Manlius Vulso (consul 189 BC)|Gnaeus Manlius Vulso]] on an expedition against the Galatians. Galatia was henceforth dominated by Rome through regional rulers from 189 BC onward.\n\nAfter their defeats by Pergamon and Rome the Galatians slowly became hellenized and they were called \"Gallo-Graeci\" by the historian [[Justin (historian)|Justin]]<ref>Justin, ''Epitome of Pompeius Trogus'', 25.2 and 26.2; the related subject of copulative compounds, where both are of equal weight, is exhaustively treated in Anna Granville Hatcher, ''Modern English Word-Formation and Neo-Latin: A Study of the Origins of English'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University), 1951.</ref> as well as {{lang|grc|\u1f19\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03bf\u03b3\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9}} (''Hell\u0113nogal\u00e1tai'') by [[Diodorus Siculus]] in his ''Bibliotheca historica'' v.32.5, who wrote that they were \"called Helleno-Galatians because of their connection with the Greeks.\"<ref>This distinction is remarked upon in William M.

After Alexander's conquests the region of Bithynia came under the rule of the native king Bas, who defeated Calas, a general of Alexander the Great, and maintained the independence of Bithynia. His son, [[Zipoetes&nbsp;I of Bithynia]] maintained this autonomy against [[Lysimachus]] and [[Seleucus&nbsp;I]], and assumed the title of king (''basileus'') in 297&nbsp;BC. His son and successor, [[Nicomedes&nbsp;I]], founded [[Nicomedia]], which soon rose to great prosperity, and during his long reign ({{circa|278|255&nbsp;BC}}), as well as those of his successors, the kingdom of Bithynia held a considerable place among the minor monarchies of Anatolia. Nicomedes also invited the Celtic Galatians into Anatolia as mercenaries, and they later turned on his son Prusias I, who defeated them in battle. Their last king, Nicomedes&nbsp;IV, was unable to maintain himself against Mithridates&nbsp;VI of Pontus, and, after being restored to his throne by the Roman Senate, he bequeathed his kingdom by will to the Roman republic (74&nbsp;BC).\n\n===Cappadocia===\n{{Main|Cappadocia}}\nCappadocia, a mountainous region situated between Pontus and the Taurus mountains, was ruled by a Persian dynasty. [[Ariarathes&nbsp;I]] (332\u2013322&nbsp;BC) was the satrap of Cappadocia under the Persians and after the conquests of Alexander he retained his post. After Alexander's death he was defeated by Eumenes and [[crucifixion|crucified]] in 322&nbsp;BC, but his son, Ariarathes&nbsp;II managed to regain the throne and maintain his autonomy against the warring Diadochi.\n\nIn 255&nbsp;BC, Ariarathes&nbsp;III took the title of king and married Stratonice, a daughter of Antiochus&nbsp;II, remaining an ally of the Seleucid kingdom. Under Ariarathes&nbsp;IV, Cappadocia came into relations with Rome, first as a foe espousing the cause of [[Antiochus the Great]], then as an ally against Perseus of Macedon and finally in a war against the Seleucids. Ariarathes&nbsp;V also waged war with Rome against Aristonicus, a claimant to the throne of Pergamon, and their forces were annihilated in 130&nbsp;BC. This defeat allowed Pontus to invade and conquer the kingdom.\n\n===Kingdom of Pontus===\n{{Main|Kingdom of Pontus}}\n[[File:Mithridates VI Louvre.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|Bust of [[Mithridates&nbsp;VI]] sporting a lion pelt headdress, a symbol of [[Herakles]].]]\nThe [[Kingdom of Pontus]] was a Hellenistic kingdom on the southern coast of the [[Black Sea]]. It was founded by [[Mithridates I of Pontus|Mithridates&nbsp;I]] in 291&nbsp;BC and lasted until its conquest by the Roman Republic in 63&nbsp;BC. Despite being ruled by a dynasty which was a descendant of the Persian [[Achaemenid Empire]] it became hellenized due to the influence of the Greek cities on the Black Sea and its neighboring kingdoms. Pontic culture was a mix of Greek and Iranian elements; the most hellenized parts of the kingdom were on the coast, populated by Greek colonies such as [[Trapezus, Arcadia|Trapezus]] and [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]], the latter of which became the capital of the kingdom. Epigraphic evidence also shows extensive Hellenistic influence in the interior. During the reign of Mithridates&nbsp;II, Pontus was allied with the Seleucids through dynastic marriages. By the time of Mithridates&nbsp;VI Eupator, Greek was the official language of the kingdom, though Anatolian languages continued to be spoken.\n\nThe kingdom grew to its largest extent under [[Mithridates&nbsp;VI]], who conquered [[Colchis]], [[Cappadocia]], [[Paphlagonia]], [[Bithynia]], Lesser Armenia, the [[Bosporan Kingdom]], the Greek colonies of the Tauric [[Chersonesus|Chersonesos]] and, for a brief time, the Roman province of Asia.

Mithridates also depicted himself with the ''anastole'' hairstyle of Alexander and used the symbolism of [[Herakles]], from whom the Macedonian kings claimed descent. After a long struggle with Rome in the Mithridatic wars, Pontus was defeated; part of it was incorporated into the Roman Republic as the province of Bithynia, while Pontus' eastern half survived as a client kingdom.\n\n===Armenia===\n{{Main|Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)}}\n[[File:Maps of the Armenian Empire of Tigranes.gif|thumb|upright=1.05|Tigranes the Great's Armenian Empire]]\n[[Orontid Dynasty|Orontid Armenia]] formally passed to the empire of Alexander the Great following his conquest of Persia. Alexander appointed an Orontid named Mithranes to govern Armenia. Armenia later became a vassal state of the [[Seleucid Empire]], but it maintained a considerable degree of autonomy, retaining its native rulers. Towards the end 212&nbsp;BC the country was divided into two kingdoms, Greater Armenia and Armenia [[Sophene]], including [[Commagene]] or Armenia Minor. The kingdoms became so independent from Seleucid control that [[Antiochus&nbsp;III the Great]] waged war on them during his reign and replaced their rulers.\n\nAfter the Seleucid defeat at the [[Battle of Magnesia]] in 190&nbsp;BC, the kings of [[Sophene]] and Greater Armenia revolted and declared their independence, with [[Artaxias I|Artaxias]] becoming the first king of the [[Artaxiad dynasty]] of Armenia in 188&nbsp;BC. During the reign of the Artaxiads, Armenia went through a period of [[hellenization]]. [[Numismatic]] evidence shows Greek artistic styles and the use of the Greek language. Some coins describe the Armenian kings as \"[[Philhellenes]]\". During the reign of [[Tigranes the Great]] (95\u201355&nbsp;BC), the kingdom of Armenia reached its greatest extent, containing many Greek cities, including the entire [[Syrian tetrapolis]]. [[Cleopatra of Pontus|Cleopatra]], the wife of [[Tigranes the Great]], invited Greeks such as the [[Rhetoric|rhetor]] Amphicrates and the historian [[Metrodorus of Scepsis]] to the Armenian court, and\u2014according to Plutarch\u2014when the Roman general Lucullus seized the Armenian capital, Tigranocerta, he found a troupe of Greek actors who had arrived to perform plays for Tigranes.<ref>Grousset pp.90-91</ref> Tigranes' successor [[Artavasdes&nbsp;II]] even composed Greek tragedies himself.\n\n===Parthia===\n{{also|Parthian Empire}}\n[[File:Orodesi.jpg|thumb|Coin of [[Phraates&nbsp;IV]] with Hellenistic titles such as Euergetes, Epiphanes and [[Philhellene]] (fond of Greek [culture])]]\n[[File:Sarbaz Nysa.jpg|thumb|150px|A sculpted head (broken off from a larger statue) of a Parthian wearing a [[Hellenistic armies|Hellenistic-style helmet]], from the Parthian royal residence and necropolis of [[Nisa, Turkmenistan]], 2nd century BC]]\n\n[[Parthia]] was a north-eastern Iranian [[satrapy]] of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] which later passed on to Alexander's empire. Under the Seleucids, Parthia was governed by various Greek [[satraps]] such as [[Nicanor (satrap)|Nicanor]] and [[Philip (satrap)|Philip]]. In 247&nbsp;BC, following the death of [[Antiochus&nbsp;II Theos]], [[Andragoras (Seleucid satrap)|Andragoras]], the Seleucid governor of Parthia, proclaimed his independence and began minting coins showing himself wearing a royal diadem and claiming kingship. He ruled until 238&nbsp;BC when [[Arsaces I of Parthia|Arsaces]], the leader of the [[Parni]] tribe conquered Parthia, killing Andragoras and inaugurating the [[Parthian Empire|Arsacid Dynasty]]. [[Antiochus&nbsp;III]] recaptured Arsacid controlled territory in 209&nbsp;BC from [[Arsaces&nbsp;II]]. Arsaces&nbsp;II sued for peace and became a vassal of the Seleucids. It was not until the reign of [[Phraates&nbsp;I]] ({{circa|176\u2013171&nbsp;BC}}), that the Arsacids would again begin to assert their independence.<ref>Bivar, A.D.H. (1983), \"The Political History of Iran under the Arsacids\", in Yarshater, Ehsan, Cambridge History of Iran 3.1, Cambridge UP, pp. 21\u201399.</ref>\n\nDuring the reign of [[Mithridates&nbsp;I of Parthia]], Arsacid control expanded to include [[Herat]] (in 167&nbsp;BC), [[Babylonia]] (in 144&nbsp;BC), [[Media (region)|Media]] (in 141&nbsp;BC), [[Persis|Persia]] (in 139&nbsp;BC), and large parts of [[Syria (region)|Syria]] (in the 110s&nbsp;BC). The [[Seleucid\u2013Parthian wars]] continued as the Seleucids invaded Mesopotamia under [[Antiochus&nbsp;VII Sidetes]] ({{reigned|138\u2013129&nbsp;BC}}), but he was eventually killed by a Parthian counterattack. After the fall of the Seleucid dynasty, the Parthians fought frequently against neighbouring Rome in the [[Roman\u2013Parthian Wars]] (66&nbsp;BC&nbsp;\u2013 AD&nbsp;217). Abundant traces of Hellenism continued under the Parthian empire. The Parthians used Greek as well as their own [[Parthian language]] (though lesser than Greek) as languages of administration and also used Greek [[drachma]]s as coinage. They enjoyed [[Greek theater]], and [[Greek art]] influenced [[Parthian art]]. The Parthians continued worshipping Greek gods [[Syncretism#Religious syncretism|syncretized]] together with Iranian deities. Their rulers established ruler cults in the manner of Hellenistic kings and often used Hellenistic royal [[epithets]].\n\nThe Hellenistic influence in Iran was significant in terms of scope, but not depth and durability\u2014unlike the Near East, the Iranian\u2013[[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] ideas and ideals remained the main source of inspiration in mainland Iran, and was soon revived in late Parthian and [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] periods.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Yarshater |first1=Ehsan |title=The Cambridge History of Iran |date=1983 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521200929 |page=1xi |language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Nabatean Kingdom===\n{{Main|Nabatean Kingdom}}\n[[File:Petra Jordan BW 21.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Al-Khazneh]] in [[Petra]] shows the Hellenistic influences on the Nabatean capital city]]\nThe [[Nabatean Kingdom]] was an [[Arab]] state located between the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and the [[Arabian Peninsula]].

The Nabateans resisted the attacks of [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus|Antigonus]] and were allies of the Hasmoneans in their struggle against the [[Seleucids]], but later fought against [[Herod the Great]].

This period also saw the rise of a [[Hellenistic Judaism]], which first developed in the Jewish diaspora of Alexandria and Antioch, and then spread to Judea. The major literary product of this cultural syncretism is the [[Septuagint]] translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] from [[Biblical Hebrew]] and [[Biblical Aramaic]] to [[Koin\u00e9 Greek]]. The reason for the production of this translation seems to be that many of the Alexandrian Jews had lost the ability to speak Hebrew and Aramaic.<ref>Green (1990), p. 501.</ref>\n\nBetween 301 and 219&nbsp;BC the Ptolemies ruled Judea in relative peace, and Jews often found themselves working in the Ptolemaic administration and army, which led to the rise of a Hellenized Jewish elite class (e.g. the [[Tobiads]]). The wars of [[Antiochus&nbsp;III]] brought the region into the Seleucid empire; Jerusalem fell to his control in 198&nbsp;BC and the Temple was repaired and provided with money and tribute.<ref>Green (1990), p. 504.</ref> [[Antiochus&nbsp;IV Epiphanes]] sacked Jerusalem and looted the Temple in 169&nbsp;BC after disturbances in Judea during his abortive invasion of Egypt. Antiochus then banned key [[Judaism|Jewish religious rites and traditions]] in Judea. He may have been attempting to Hellenize the region and unify his empire and the Jewish resistance to this eventually led to an escalation of violence. Whatever the case, tensions between pro- and anti-Seleucid Jewish factions led to the 174\u2013135&nbsp;BC [[Maccabean Revolt]] of [[Judas Maccabeus]] (whose victory is celebrated in the Jewish festival of [[Hanukkah]]).\n\nModern interpretations see this period as a civil war between Hellenized and orthodox forms of Judaism.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/faithbased/2005/12/the_maccabees_and_the_hellenists.html |title=The Maccabees and the Hellenists |last=Ponet |first=James |date=22 December 2005 |work=Faith-based |publisher=Slate |accessdate=4 December 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"simpletoremember\">{{cite web |url=http://www.simpletoremember.com/articles/a/the_revolt_of_the_maccabees/ |title=The Revolt of the Maccabees |publisher=Simpletoremember.com |accessdate=2012-08-13}}</ref> Out of this revolt was formed an independent Jewish kingdom known as the [[Hasmonaean Dynasty]], which lasted from 165&nbsp;BC to 63&nbsp;BC. The Hasmonean Dynasty eventually disintegrated in [[Hyrcanus II#Deposition|a civil war]], which [[Hyrcanus II#Roman intervention|coincided with civil wars in Rome]]. The last Hasmonean ruler, [[Antigonus&nbsp;II Mattathias]], was captured by Herod and executed in 37&nbsp;BC. In spite of originally being a revolt against Greek overlordship, the Hasmonean kingdom and also the [[Herodian kingdom]] which followed gradually became more and more hellenized. From 37&nbsp;BC to 4&nbsp;BC, [[Herod the Great]] ruled as a Jewish-Roman client king appointed by the [[Roman Senate]]. He considerably enlarged the Temple (see [[Herod's Temple]]), making it one of the largest religious structures in the world. The style of the enlarged temple and other [[Herodian architecture]] shows significant Hellenistic architectural influence.

Between 255 and 246&nbsp;BC, the governor of [[Bactria]], [[Sogdiana]] and [[Margiana]] (most of present-day [[Afghanistan]]), one [[Diodotus I|Diodotus]], took this process to its logical extreme and declared himself king. Diodotus&nbsp;II, son of Diodotus, was overthrown in about 230&nbsp;BC by [[Euthydemus I|Euthydemus]], possibly the satrap of Sogdiana, who then started his own dynasty. In {{circa|210&nbsp;BC}}, the Greco-Bactrian kingdom was invaded by a resurgent Seleucid empire under [[Antiochus&nbsp;III]]. While victorious in the field, it seems Antiochus came to realise that there were advantages in the status quo (perhaps sensing that Bactria could not be governed from Syria), and married one of his daughters to Euthydemus's son, thus legitimising the Greco-Bactrian dynasty. Soon afterwards the Greco-Bactrian kingdom seems to have expanded, possibly taking advantage of the defeat of the Parthian king [[Arsaces II of Parthia|Arsaces&nbsp;II]] by Antiochus.\n\nAccording to [[Strabo]], the Greco-Bactrians seem to have had contacts with China through the [[silk road]] trade routes (Strabo, XI.11.1). Indian sources also maintain religious contact between Buddhist monks and the Greeks, and some Greco-Bactrians did convert to [[Buddhism]]. [[Demetrius I of Bactria|Demetrius]], son and successor of Euthydemus, invaded north-western India in 180&nbsp;BC, after the destruction of the Mauryan Empire there; the Mauryans were probably allies of the Bactrians (and Seleucids). The exact justification for the invasion remains unclear, but by about 175&nbsp;BC, the Greeks ruled over parts of northwestern India. This period also marks the beginning of the obfuscation of Greco-Bactrian history. Demetrius possibly died about 180&nbsp;BC; numismatic evidence suggests the existence of several other kings shortly thereafter. It is probable that at this point the Greco-Bactrian kingdom split into several semi-independent regions for some years, often warring amongst themselves. Heliocles was the last Greek to clearly rule Bactria, his power collapsing in the face of central Asian tribal invasions ([[Scythian]] and [[Yuezhi]]), by about 130&nbsp;BC. However, Greek urban civilisation seems to have continued in Bactria after the fall of the kingdom, having a hellenising effect on the tribes which had displaced Greek rule. The [[Kushan Empire]] which followed continued to use Greek on their coinage and Greeks continued being influential in the empire.\n\n==Indo-Greek kingdoms==\n{{Main|Indo-Greeks}}\n{{See also|Indo-Greek religions}}\n[[File:Indo-Greeks 100bc.jpg|thumb|right|Indo-Greek Kingdoms in 100&nbsp;BC.]]\n[[File:Buddha-Vajrapani-Herakles.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Heracles]] as protector of Buddha, [[Vajrapani]], 2nd-century [[Gandhara]].]]\nThe separation of the [[Indo-Greek kingdom]] from the [[Greco-Bactrian kingdom]] resulted in an even more isolated position, and thus the details of the Indo-Greek kingdom are even more obscure than for Bactria. Many supposed kings in India are known only because of coins bearing their name. The numismatic evidence together with archaeological finds and the scant historical records suggest that the fusion of eastern and western cultures reached its peak in the Indo-Greek kingdom.\n\nAfter Demetrius' death, civil wars between Bactrian kings in India allowed [[Apollodotus&nbsp;I]] (from {{circa|180/175&nbsp;BC}}) to make himself independent as the first proper Indo-Greek king (who did not rule from Bactria). Large numbers of his coins have been found in India, and he seems to have reigned in [[Gandhara]] as well as western [[Punjab]]. Apollodotus&nbsp;I was succeeded by or ruled alongside [[Antimachus&nbsp;II]], likely the son of the Bactrian king [[Antimachus&nbsp;I]].<ref>Bopearachchi, ''Monnaies'', p.63</ref> In about 155 (or 165) BC he seems to have been succeeded by the most successful of the Indo-Greek kings, [[Menander&nbsp;I]]. Menander converted to [[Buddhism]], and seems to have been a great patron of the religion; he is remembered in some Buddhist texts as 'Milinda'. He also expanded the kingdom further east into Punjab, though these conquests were rather ephemeral.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| image1 = Heliodorus pillar inscription.jpg\n| width1 = 122\n| caption1  = <center>The [[Heliodorus pillar]], commissioned by Indo-Greek ambassador [[Heliodorus (votive erector)|Heliodorus]], one of the earliest recorded Indo-Greek converts to [[Hinduism]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Avari|first1=Burjor|title=India: The Ancient Past: A History of the Indian Subcontinent from C. 7000 BCE to CE 1200|date=2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317236733|page=167|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WTaTDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA167|language=en}}</ref></center>\n| image2 = MenandrosCoin.jpg\n| width2 = 200\n| caption2 = <center>[[Menander&nbsp;I]] converted to [[Buddhism]], as described in the [[Milinda Panha]].

This inevitably weakened the Greek position, and territory seems to have been lost progressively. Around 70&nbsp;BC, the western regions of [[Arachosia]] and [[Paropamisadae]] were lost to tribal invasions, presumably by those tribes responsible for the end of the Bactrian kingdom. The resulting [[Indo-Scythians|Indo-Scythian]] kingdom seems to have gradually pushed the remaining Indo-Greek kingdom towards the east. The Indo-Greek kingdom appears to have lingered on in western Punjab until about AD&nbsp;10, at which time it was finally ended by the Indo-Scythians.\n\nAfter conquering the Indo-Greeks, the [[Kushan empire]] took over [[Greco-Buddhism]], the Greek language, [[Greek script]], Greek coinage and artistic styles. Greeks continued being an important part of the cultural world of India for generations. The depictions of the Buddha appear to have been influenced by Greek culture: Buddha representations in the Ghandara period often showed Buddha under the protection of Herakles.<ref name=\"sanujit\">Ghose, Sanujit (2011). [http://www.ancient.eu.com/article/208/ \"Cultural links between India and the Greco-Roman world\"].

The [[Mahabharata]] compliments them as \"the all-knowing Yavanas\" (''sarvaj\u00f1\u0101 yavan\u0101''); e.g., \"The Yavanas, O king, are all-knowing; the Suras are particularly so.

Hellenism or at least [[Philhellenism]] reached most regions on the frontiers of the Hellenistic kingdoms. Though some of these regions were not ruled by Greeks or even Greek speaking elites, certain Hellenistic influences can be seen in the historical record and [[material culture]] of these regions. Other regions had established contact with Greek colonies before this period, and simply saw a continued process of [[Hellenization]] and intermixing.\n\nBefore the Hellenistic period, Greek colonies had been established on the coast of the [[Crimean]] and [[Taman peninsula]]s. The [[Bosporan Kingdom]] was a multi-ethnic kingdom of Greek city states and local tribal peoples such as the [[Maeotians]], [[Thracians]], Crimean [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]] under the [[Spartocids|Spartocid dynasty]] (438\u2013110&nbsp;BC). The Spartocids were a hellenized Thracian family from [[Panticapaeum]]. The Bosporans had long lasting trade contacts with the [[Scythian]] peoples of the [[Pontic-Caspian steppe]], and Hellenistic influence can be seen in the Scythian settlements of the [[Crimea]], such as in the [[Scythian Neapolis]]. Scythian pressure on the Bosporan kingdom under Paerisades&nbsp;V led to its eventual vassalage under the Pontic king [[Mithradates&nbsp;VI]] for protection, {{circa|107&nbsp;BC}}. It later became a Roman client state. Other [[Scythians]] on the steppes of [[Central Asia]] came into contact with Hellenistic culture through the Greeks of Bactria. Many Scythian elites purchased Greek products and some [[Scythian art]] shows Greek influences. At least some Scythians seem to have become Hellenized, because we know of conflicts between the elites of the Scythian kingdom over the adoption of Greek ways. These Hellenized Scythians were known as the \"young Scythians\".<ref>Claessen & Skaln\u00edk (editors), The Early State, page 428.</ref> The peoples around [[Olbia, Ukraine|Pontic Olbia]], known as the ''Callipidae'', were intermixed and Hellenized Greco-Scythians.<ref>Gent, John.

From the 6th century BC on, the multiethnic people in this region gradually intermixed with each other, creating a Greco-Getic populace.<ref>P\u00e2rvan, Vasile.

The kingdom of [[Colchis]], which later became a Roman client state, received Hellenistic influences from the Black Sea Greek colonies.\n\nIn Arabia, [[Bahrain]], which was referred to by the Greeks as [[Tylos]], the centre of pearl trading, when [[Nearchus]] came to discover it serving under [[Alexander the Great]].<ref name=\"Larsen\">{{cite book |title=Life and Land Use on the Bahrain Islands: The Geoarcheology of an Ancient Society |author=Curtis E.

Carthaginian culture came into contact with the Greeks through [[Punic]] colonies in [[Sicily]] and through their widespread Mediterranean trade network. While the Carthaginians retained their [[Punic]] culture and language, they did adopt some Hellenistic ways, one of the most prominent of which was their military practices. In 550&nbsp;BC, [[Mago&nbsp;I of Carthage]] began a series of military reforms which included copying the army of [[Timoleon]], [[Tyrant of Syracuse]].<ref>[[Justin (historian)|Justin]], 19, 1.1</ref> The core of Carthage's military was the Greek-style [[phalanx]] formed by citizen [[hoplite]] spearmen who had been [[conscripted]] into service, though their armies also included large numbers of mercenaries. After their defeat in the [[First Punic War]], Carthage hired a Spartan mercenary captain, [[Xanthippus of Carthage]], to reform their military forces. Xanthippus reformed the Carthaginian military along [[Ancient Macedonian army|Macedonian army]] lines.\n\nBy the 2nd century BC, the kingdom of [[Numidia]] also began to see Hellenistic culture influence its art and architecture. The Numidian royal monument at [[Chemtou]] is one example of Numidian Hellenized architecture. Reliefs on the monument also show the Numidians had adopted Greco-Macedonian type armor and shields for their soldiers.<ref>Prag & Quinn (editors). The Hellenistic West, pp. 229\u2013237.</ref>\n \nPtolemaic Egypt was the center of Hellenistic influence in Africa and Greek colonies also thrived in the region of [[Cyrene, Libya]]. The kingdom of [[Mero\u00eb]] was in constant contact with Ptolemaic Egypt and Hellenistic influences can be seen in their art and archaeology. There was a temple to [[Serapis]], the Greco-Egyptian god.\n\n==Rise of Rome==\n[[File:East-Hem 100bc.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Eastern hemisphere at the end of the 2nd century BC.]]\nWidespread Roman interference in the Greek world was probably inevitable given the general manner of the ascendancy of the [[Roman Republic]]. This Roman-Greek interaction began as a consequence of the Greek city-states located along the coast of southern Italy. Rome had come to dominate the Italian peninsula, and desired the submission of the Greek cities to its rule. Although they initially resisted, allying themselves with [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]], and defeating the Romans at several battles, the Greek cities were unable to maintain this position and were absorbed by the Roman republic. Shortly afterwards, Rome became involved in Sicily, fighting against the [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] in the [[First Punic War]]. The end result was the complete conquest of Sicily, including its previously powerful Greek cities, by the Romans.\n\nRoman entanglement in the Balkans began when Illyrian piratical raids on Roman merchants led to invasions of Illyria (the [[First Illyrian War|First]] and, [[Second Illyrian War]]s). Tension between Macedon and Rome increased when the young king of Macedon, [[Philip V of Macedon|Philip&nbsp;V]], harbored one of the chief pirates, [[Demetrius of Pharos]]<ref>{{cite book |title=Alexander The Great and the Hellenistic Age |pages=98\u201399 |last=Green |first=P |isbn=978-0-7538-2413-9|year=2008 }}</ref> (a former client of Rome). As a result, in an attempt to reduce Roman influence in the Balkans, Philip allied himself with Carthage after [[Hannibal]] had dealt the Romans a massive defeat at the [[Battle of Cannae]] (216&nbsp;BC) during the [[Second Punic War]]. Forcing the Romans to fight on another front when they were at a nadir of manpower gained Philip the lasting enmity of the Romans\u2014the only real result from the somewhat insubstantial [[First Macedonian War]] (215\u2013202&nbsp;BC).\n\nOnce the [[Second Punic War]] had been resolved, and the Romans had begun to regather their strength, they looked to re-assert their influence in the Balkans, and to curb the expansion of Philip. A pretext for war was provided by Philip's refusal to end his [[Cretan War (205\u2013200 BC)|war]] with [[Attalid dynasty|Attalid]] [[Pergamum]] and [[Rhodes]], both Roman allies.<ref>{{cite book |title=Alexander The Great and the Hellenistic Age |pages=102\u2013103 |last=Green |first=P |isbn=978-0-7538-2413-9|year=2008 }}</ref> The Romans, also allied with the [[Aetolian League]] of Greek city-states (which resented Philip's power), thus declared war on Macedon in 200&nbsp;BC, starting the [[Second Macedonian War]]. This ended with a decisive Roman victory at the [[Battle of Cynoscephalae]] (197&nbsp;BC). Like most Roman peace treaties of the period, the resultant 'Peace of Flaminius' was designed utterly to crush the power of the defeated party; a massive indemnity was levied, Philip's fleet was surrendered to Rome, and Macedon was effectively returned to its ancient boundaries, losing influence over the city-states of southern Greece, and land in Thrace and Asia Minor. The result was the end of Macedon as a major power in the Mediterranean.\n\nAs a result of the confusion in Greece at the end of the Second Macedonian War, the Seleucid Empire also became entangled with the Romans. The Seleucid [[Antiochus&nbsp;III]] had allied with Philip&nbsp;V of Macedon in 203&nbsp;BC, agreeing that they should jointly conquer the lands of the boy-king of Egypt, [[Ptolemy&nbsp;V]]. After defeating Ptolemy in the [[Fifth Syrian War]], Antiochus concentrated on occupying the Ptolemaic possessions in Asia Minor. However, this brought Antiochus into conflict with Rhodes and Pergamum, two important Roman allies, and began a 'cold war' between Rome and Antiochus (not helped by the presence of Hannibal at the Seleucid court).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Meanwhile, in mainland Greece, the [[Aetolian League]], which had sided with Rome against Macedon, now grew to resent the Roman presence in Greece. This presented Antiochus&nbsp;III with a pretext to invade Greece and 'liberate' it from Roman influence, thus starting the [[Roman-Syrian War]] (192\u2013188&nbsp;BC). In 191&nbsp;BC, the Romans under Manius Acilius Glabrio routed him at Thermopylae and obliged him to withdraw to Asia. During the course of this war Roman troops moved into Asia for the first time, where they defeated Antiochus again at the [[Battle of Magnesia]] (190&nbsp;BC). A crippling treaty was imposed on Antiochus, with Seleucid possessions in Asia Minor removed and given to Rhodes and Pergamum, the size of the Seleucid navy reduced, and a massive war indemnity invoked.\n[[File:Jean-Fran\u00e7ois-Pierre Peyron 001.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Perseus of Macedon surrenders to Paullus. Painting by [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Pierre Peyron]] from 1802. [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]], [[Budapest]].]]\nThus, in less than twenty years, Rome had destroyed the power of one of the successor states, crippled another, and firmly entrenched its influence over Greece. This was primarily a result of the over-ambition of the Macedonian kings, and their unintended provocation of Rome, though Rome was quick to exploit the situation. In another twenty years, the Macedonian kingdom was no more. Seeking to re-assert Macedonian power and Greek independence, Philip&nbsp;V's son [[Perseus of Macedon|Perseus]] incurred the wrath of the Romans, resulting in the [[Third Macedonian War]] (171\u2013168&nbsp;BC). Victorious, the Romans abolished the Macedonian kingdom, replacing it with four puppet republics; these lasted a further twenty years before Macedon was formally annexed as a Roman province (146&nbsp;BC) after yet another rebellion under [[Andriscus]]. Rome now demanded that the Achaean League, the last stronghold of Greek independence, be dissolved. The Achaeans refused and declared war on Rome. Most of the Greek cities rallied to the Achaeans' side, even slaves were freed to fight for Greek independence. The Roman consul [[Lucius Mummius]] advanced from Macedonia and defeated the Greeks at [[Corinth]], which was razed to the ground. In 146&nbsp;BC, the Greek peninsula, though not the islands, became a Roman protectorate. Roman taxes were imposed, except in Athens and Sparta, and all the cities had to accept rule by Rome's local allies.\n\nThe Attalid dynasty of Pergamum lasted little longer; a Roman ally until the end, its final king [[Attalus&nbsp;III]] died in 133&nbsp;BC without an heir, and taking the alliance to its natural conclusion, willed Pergamum to the Roman Republic.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite book |title=Rubicon: Triumph and Tragedy in the Roman Republic |last=Holland |first=T |isbn=978-0-349-11563-4|year=2004 }}</ref> The final Greek resistance came in 88&nbsp;BC, when King [[Mithridates VI of Pontus|Mithridates]] of [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontus]] rebelled against Rome, captured Roman held Anatolia, and massacred up to 100,000 Romans and Roman allies across Asia Minor. Many Greek cities, including Athens, overthrew their Roman puppet rulers and joined him in the [[Mithridatic wars]]. When he was driven out of Greece by the Roman general [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]], the latter laid siege to Athens and razed the city. Mithridates was finally defeated by [[Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus]] (Pompey the Great) in 65&nbsp;BC. Further ruin was brought to Greece by the Roman civil wars, which were partly fought in Greece. Finally, in 27&nbsp;BC, [[Caesar Augustus|Augustus]] directly annexed Greece to the new [[Roman Empire]] as the [[Achaea Province, Roman Empire|province of Achaea]]. The struggles with Rome had left Greece depopulated and demoralised. Nevertheless, Roman rule at least brought an end to warfare, and cities such as Athens, Corinth, Thessaloniki and [[Patras]] soon recovered their prosperity.\n\nContrarily, having so firmly entrenched themselves into Greek affairs, the Romans now completely ignored the rapidly disintegrating Seleucid empire (perhaps because it posed no threat); and left the Ptolemaic kingdom to decline quietly, while acting as a protector of sorts, in as much as to stop other powers taking Egypt over (including the famous line-in-the-sand [[Gaius Popillius Laenas|incident]] when the Seleucid [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] tried to invade Egypt).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Eventually, instability in the near east resulting from the power vacuum left by the collapse of the Seleucid Empire caused the Roman [[proconsul]] [[Pompey the Great]] to abolish the Seleucid rump state, absorbing much of Syria into the Roman Republic.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Famously, the end of Ptolemaic Egypt came as the final act in the republican civil war between the Roman triumvirs [[Mark Antony|Mark Anthony]] and [[Augustus Caesar]]. After the defeat of Anthony and his lover, the last Ptolemaic monarch, [[Cleopatra&nbsp;VII]], at the [[Battle of Actium]], Augustus invaded Egypt and took it as his own personal fiefdom.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> He thereby completed both the destruction of the Hellenistic kingdoms and the Roman Republic, and ended (in hindsight) the Hellenistic era.\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:ancientlibraryalex.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Library of Alexandria|Library]] of [[Alexandria]] in the [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic Kingdom]], here shown in an artist's impression, was the largest and most significant [[List of libraries in the ancient world|library of the ancient world]].<ref name=\"Sagan, C. 1980\">Cosmos: A Personal Voyage, Sagan, C 1980, {{YouTube|Pa1ImgOcOPM|\"Episode 1: The Shores of the Cosmic Ocean\"}}</ref>]]\n[[File:Rosetta Stone.JPG|thumb|alt=\"A large dark grey-coloured slab of stone with text that uses Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, demotic and Greek script in three separate horizontal registers\"|The [[Rosetta Stone]], a trilingual Ptolemaic decree establishing the religious cult of [[Ptolemy&nbsp;V]]]]\n\nIn some fields Hellenistic culture thrived, particularly in its preservation of the past. The states of the Hellenistic period were deeply fixated with the past and its seemingly lost glories.<ref>Green (1990), pp. xx, 68\u201369.</ref> The preservation of many classical and archaic works of art and literature (including the works of the three great classical tragedians, [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]], and [[Euripides]]) are due to the efforts of the Hellenistic Greeks. The museum and library of Alexandria was the center of this conservationist activity. With the support of royal stipends, Alexandrian scholars collected, translated, copied, classified, and critiqued every book they could find. Most of the great literary figures of the Hellenistic period studied at Alexandria and conducted research there. They were scholar poets, writing not only poetry but treatises on Homer and other archaic and classical Greek literature.<ref>Bugh, Glenn R. (editor).

Settlements such as [[Ai-Khanoum]], on trade routes, allowed Greek culture to mix and spread. The language of Philip&nbsp;II's and Alexander's court and army (which was made up of various Greek and non-Greek speaking peoples) was a version of [[Attic Greek]], and over time this language developed into [[Koine]], the [[lingua franca]] of the successor states.\n\nThe identification of local gods with similar Greek deities, a practice termed '[[Interpretatio graeca]]', stimulated the building of Greek-style temples, and Greek culture in the cities meant that buildings such as [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasia]] and [[Theatre of ancient Greece#Characteristics of the buildings|theaters]] became common. Many cities maintained nominal autonomy while under the rule of the local king or [[satrap]], and often had Greek-style institutions. Greek dedications, statues, architecture, and inscriptions have all been found. However, local cultures were not replaced, and mostly went on as before, but now with a new Greco-Macedonian or otherwise Hellenized elite. An example that shows the spread of Greek theater is [[Plutarch]]'s story of the death of [[Crassus]], in which his head was taken to the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] court and used as a prop in a performance of [[The Bacchae]]. Theaters have also been found: for example, in [[Ai-Khanoum]] on the edge of [[Bactria]], the theater has 35 rows \u2013 larger than the theater in [[Babylon]].\n\nThe spread of Greek influence and language is also shown through [[Ancient Greek coinage]]. Portraits became more realistic, and the obverse of the coin was often used to display a propagandistic image, commemorating an event or displaying the image of a favored god. The use of Greek-style portraits and Greek language continued under the Roman, [[Parthian empire|Parthian]], and [[Kushan empire]]s, even as the use of Greek was in decline.\n\n===Hellenization and acculturation===\n[[File:Gandhara Buddha (tnm).jpeg|thumb|One of the first representations of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], and an example of [[Greco-Buddhist art]], 1st-2nd century AD, [[Gandhara]]: [[Standing Buddha (Tokyo National Museum)]].]]\n[[File:Rampurva bull in Presidential Palace high closeup.jpg|thumb|Bull [[Capital (architecture)|capital]] from [[Rampurva]], one of the [[Pillars of Ashoka]], [[Maurya Empire]], 3rd century BC.

Notice the florals on the bull capital from Rampurva, and the style of the horse on the Sarnath capital, now the emblem of the Republic of India.\"</ref>]]\n{{Further|Hellenization}}\nThe concept of Hellenization, meaning the adoption of Greek culture in non-Greek regions, has long been controversial. Undoubtedly Greek influence did spread through the Hellenistic realms, but to what extent, and whether this was a deliberate policy or mere cultural diffusion, have been hotly debated.\n\nIt seems likely that Alexander himself pursued policies which led to Hellenization, such as the foundations of new cities and Greek colonies. While it may have been a deliberate attempt to spread Greek culture (or as Arrian says, \"to civilise the natives\"), it is more likely that it was a series of pragmatic measures designed to aid in the rule of his enormous empire.<ref name=\"Green, p. 21\">Green, p. 21.</ref> Cities and colonies were centers of administrative control and Macedonian power in a newly conquered region. Alexander also seems to have attempted to create a mixed Greco-Persian elite class as shown by the [[Susa weddings]] and his adoption of some forms of Persian dress and court culture. He also brought Persian and other non-Greek peoples into his military and even the elite cavalry units of the [[companion cavalry]]. Again, it is probably better to see these policies as a pragmatic response to the demands of ruling a large empire<ref name=\"Green, p. 21\"/> than to any idealized attempt to bringing [[Greek culture]] to the '[[barbarians]]'. This approach was bitterly resented by the Macedonians and discarded by most of the Diadochi after Alexander's death. These policies can also be interpreted as the result of Alexander's possible [[megalomania]]<ref name=\"Green, p. 23\">Green, p. 23.</ref> during his later years.\n\nAfter Alexander's death in 323&nbsp;BC, the influx of Greek colonists into the new realms continued to spread Greek culture into Asia. The founding of new cities and military colonies continued to be a major part of the Successors' struggle for control of any particular region, and these continued to be centers of cultural diffusion. The spread of Greek culture under the Successors seems mostly to have occurred with the spreading of Greeks themselves, rather than as an active policy.\n\nThroughout the Hellenistic world, these Greco-Macedonian colonists considered themselves by and large superior to the native \"barbarians\" and excluded most non-Greeks from the upper echelons of courtly and government life. Most of the native population was not Hellenized, had little access to Greek culture and often found themselves discriminated against by their Hellenic overlords.<ref>Green (1990), p. 313.</ref> [[Gymnasiums]] and their Greek education, for example, were for Greeks only. Greek cities and colonies may have exported Greek art and architecture as far as the [[Indus]], but these were mostly enclaves of Greek culture for the transplanted Greek [[elite]]. The degree of influence that Greek culture had throughout the Hellenistic kingdoms was therefore highly localized and based mostly on a few great cities like Alexandria and Antioch. Some natives did learn Greek and adopt Greek ways, but this was mostly limited to a few local elites who were allowed to retain their posts by the Diadochi and also to a small number of mid-level administrators who acted as intermediaries between the Greek speaking upper class and their subjects. In the Seleucid Empire, for example, this group amounted to only 2.5 percent of the [[official]] class.<ref>Green (1990), p. 315.</ref>\n\n[[Hellenistic art]] nevertheless had a considerable influence on the cultures that had been affected by the Hellenistic expansion. As far as the Indian subcontinent, [[Hellenistic influence on Indian art]] was broad and far-reaching, and had effects for several centuries following the forays of Alexander the Great.\n\nDespite their initial reluctance, the Successors seem to have later deliberately naturalized themselves to their different regions, presumably in order to help maintain control of the population.<ref>Green, p. 22.</ref> In the Ptolemaic kingdom, we find some Egyptianized Greeks by the 2nd century onwards. In the [[Indo-Greek kingdom]] we find kings who were converts to [[Buddhism]] (e.g., [[Menander I|Menander]]). The Greeks in the regions therefore gradually become 'localized', adopting local customs as appropriate. In this way, hybrid 'Hellenistic' cultures naturally emerged, at least among the upper echelons of society.\n\nThe trends of Hellenization were therefore accompanied by Greeks adopting native ways over time, but this was widely varied by place and by social class. The farther away from the Mediterranean and the lower in social status, the more likely that a colonist was to adopt local ways, while the Greco-Macedonian elites and royal families usually remained thoroughly Greek and viewed most non-Greeks with disdain. It was not until [[Cleopatra&nbsp;VII]] that a Ptolemaic ruler bothered to learn the [[Egyptian language]] of their subjects.\n\n===Religion===\n{{Main|Hellenistic religion}}\n[[File:Zeus Ammon (Antikensammlung M\u00fcnchen).jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Bust of [[Amun#Greece|Zeus-Ammon]], a deity with attributes from Greek and Egyptian gods.]]\nIn the Hellenistic period, there was much continuity in [[Ancient Greek religion|Greek religion]]: the [[Greek gods]] continued to be worshiped, and the same rites were practiced as before. However the socio-political changes brought on by the conquest of the Persian empire and Greek emigration abroad meant that change also came to religious practices. This varied greatly by location. Athens, Sparta and most cities in the Greek mainland did not see much religious change or new gods (with the exception of the Egyptian [[Isis]] in Athens),<ref>Bugh, pp. 206\u2013210.</ref> while the multi-ethnic Alexandria had a very varied group of gods and religious practices, including Egyptian, Jewish and Greek. Greek emigres brought their Greek religion everywhere they went, even as far as India and Afghanistan. Non-Greeks also had more freedom to travel and trade throughout the Mediterranean and in this period we can see Egyptian gods such as [[Serapis]], and the [[Greater Syria|Syria]]n gods [[Atargatis]] and [[Hadad]], as well as a Jewish [[synagogue]], all coexisting on the island of [[Delos]] alongside classical Greek deities.<ref>Bugh, p. 209.</ref> A common practice was to identify Greek gods with native gods that had similar characteristics and this created new fusions like Zeus-Ammon, [[Aphrodite]] Hagne (a Hellenized [[Atargatis]]) and [[Isis]]-[[Demeter]]. Greek emigres faced individual religious choices they had not faced on their home cities, where the gods they worshiped were dictated by tradition.\n[[File:Cybele Getty Villa 57.AA.19.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Cybele]], a [[Phrygia]]n mother Goddess, enthroned, with [[lion]], [[cornucopia]] and [[Mural crown]].]]\n\nHellenistic monarchies were closely associated with the religious life of the kingdoms they ruled. This had already been a feature of Macedonian kingship, which had priestly duties.<ref>Wallbank et al. (2008), p. 84.</ref> Hellenistic kings adopted patron deities as protectors of their house and sometimes claimed descent from them. The Seleucids for example took on [[Apollo]] as patron, the Antigonids had [[Herakles]], and the Ptolemies claimed [[Dionysus]] among others.<ref>Wallbank et al. (2008), p. 86.</ref>\n\nThe worship of dynastic ruler cults was also a feature of this period, most notably in Egypt, where the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]] adopted earlier Pharaonic practice, and established themselves as [[god-kings]]. These cults were usually associated with a specific temple in honor of the ruler such as the ''Ptolemaieia'' at Alexandria and had their own festivals and theatrical performances. The setting up of ruler cults was more based on the systematized honors offered to the kings (sacrifice, [[proskynesis]], statues, altars, hymns) which put them on par with the gods (''isotheism'') than on actual belief of their divine nature. According to Peter Green, these cults did not produce genuine belief of the divinity of rulers among the Greeks and Macedonians.<ref>Green (1990), p. 402.</ref> The worship of Alexander was also popular, as in the long lived cult at [[Erythrae]] and of course, at Alexandria, where his tomb was located.\n\nThe Hellenistic age also saw a rise in the disillusionment with traditional religion.<ref>Green (1990), p. 396.</ref> The rise of philosophy and the sciences had removed the gods from many of their traditional domains such as their role in the movement of the heavenly bodies and natural disasters. The [[Sophists]] proclaimed the centrality of humanity and [[agnosticism]]; the belief in [[Euhemerism]] (the view that the gods were simply ancient kings and heroes), became popular. The popular philosopher [[Epicurus]] promoted a [[Epicureanism#Religion|view of disinterested gods]] living far away from the human realm in [[metakosmia]]. The [[apotheosis]] of rulers also brought the idea of divinity down to earth. While there does seem to have been a substantial decline in religiosity, this was mostly reserved for the educated classes.<ref>Green (1990), p. 399.</ref>\n\n[[Magic in the Greco-Roman world|Magic]] was practiced widely, and this, too, was a continuation from earlier times. Throughout the Hellenistic world, people would consult [[oracle]]s, and use [[Amulet|charms]] and figurines to deter misfortune or to cast spells. Also developed in this era was the complex system of [[Hellenistic astrology|astrology]], which sought to determine a person's character and future in the movements of the [[sun]], [[moon]], and [[planets]]. Astrology was widely associated with the cult of [[Tyche]] (luck, fortune), which grew in popularity during this period.\n\n===Literature===\n[[File:Relief with Menander and New Comedy Masks - Princeton Art Museum.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Relief with Menander and New Comedy Masks (Roman, AD&nbsp;40\u201360). The masks show three New Comedy stock characters: youth, false maiden, old man. [[Princeton University Art Museum]]]]\nThe Hellenistic period saw the rise of [[New Comedy]], the only few surviving representative texts being those of [[Menander]] (born 342/341&nbsp;BC). Only one play, ''[[Dyskolos]]'', survives in its entirety. The plots of this new Hellenistic [[comedy of manners]] were more domestic and formulaic, stereotypical low born characters such as slaves became more important, the language was colloquial and major motifs included [[escapism]], marriage, romance and luck ([[Tyche]]).<ref>Green (1990), page 66-74.</ref> Though no Hellenistic tragedy remains intact, they were still widely produced during the period, yet it seems that there was no major breakthrough in style, remaining within the classical model. The ''Supplementum Hellenisticum'', a modern collection of extant fragments, contains the fragments of 150 authors.<ref>Green (1990), page 65.</ref>\n\n[[Hellenistic poetry|Hellenistic poets]] now sought patronage from kings, and wrote works in their honor. The scholars at the libraries in Alexandria and Pergamon focused on the collection, cataloging, and [[literary criticism]] of classical Athenian works and ancient Greek myths. The poet-critic [[Callimachus]], a staunch elitist, wrote hymns equating Ptolemy&nbsp;II to Zeus and Apollo. He promoted short poetic forms such as the [[epigram]], [[epyllion]] and the [[Iambus (genre)|iambic]] and attacked epic as base and common (\"big book, big evil\" was his doctrine).<ref>Green (1990), p. 179.</ref> He also wrote a massive catalog of the holdings of the library of Alexandria, the famous [[Pinakes]]. Callimachus was extremely influential in his time and also for the development of [[Augustan poetry]]. Another poet, [[Apollonius of Rhodes]], attempted to revive the epic for the Hellenistic world with his [[Argonautica]]. He had been a student of Callimachus and later became chief librarian (''prostates'') of the library of Alexandria. Apollonius and Callimachus spent much of their careers feuding with each other. [[Pastoral poetry]] also thrived during the Hellenistic era, [[Theocritus]] was a major poet who popularized the genre.\n\nThis period also saw the rise of the [[Ancient Greek novel]], such as [[Daphnis and Chloe]] and the [[Ephesian Tale]].\n\nAround 240&nbsp;BC Livius Andronicus, a Greek slave from southern Italy, translated Homer's ''Odyssey'' into Latin. Greek literature would have a dominant effect on the development of the [[Latin literature]] of the Romans. The poetry of [[Virgil]], [[Horace]] and [[Ovid]] were all based on Hellenistic styles.\n\n===Philosophy===\n[[File:Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico (Napoli, 1969) - BEIC 6353768.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Zeno of Citium]] founded [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosophy.]]\n{{Main|Hellenistic philosophy}}\nDuring the Hellenistic period, many different schools of thought developed, and these schools of Hellenistic philosophy had a significant influence on the Greek and Roman ruling elite. \n\nAthens, with its multiple philosophical schools, continued to remain the center of philosophical thought. However, Athens had now lost her political freedom, and Hellenistic philosophy is a reflection of this new difficult period. In this political climate, Hellenistic philosophers went in search of goals such as [[ataraxia]] (un-disturbedness), [[autarky]] (self-sufficiency), and [[apatheia]] (freedom from suffering), which would allow them to wrest well-being or [[eudaimonia]] out of the most difficult turns of fortune. This occupation with the inner life, with personal inner liberty and with the pursuit of [[eudaimonia]] is what all Hellenistic philosophical schools have in common.<ref>Green, Peter; Alexander to Actium, the historical evolution of the Hellenistic age, page 53.</ref>\n\nThe [[Epicureans]] and the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]] eschewed public offices and civic service, which amounted to a rejection of the [[polis]] itself, the defining institution of the Greek world. [[Epicurus]] promoted [[atomism]] and an [[asceticism]] based on freedom from pain as its ultimate goal. Cynics such as [[Diogenes of Sinope]] rejected all material possessions and social conventions (''nomos'') as unnatural and useless. The [[Cyrenaics]], meanwhile, embraced [[hedonism]], arguing that pleasure was the only true good. [[Stoicism]], founded by [[Zeno of Citium]], taught that [[virtue]] was sufficient for [[eudaimonia]] as it would allow one to live in accordance with Nature or [[Logos]]. The philosophical schools of [[Aristotle]] (the [[Peripatetics]] of the [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]]) and [[Plato]] ([[Platonism]] at the [[Platonic Academy|Academy]]) also remained influential. Against these [[dogma|dogmatic]] schools of philosophy the [[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonist]] school embraced [[philosophical skepticism]], and, starting with [[Arcesilaus]], Plato's Academy also embraced skepticism in the form of [[Academic Skepticism]]. \n\nThe spread of [[Christianity]] throughout the Roman world, followed by the [[spread of Islam]], ushered in the end of Hellenistic philosophy and the beginnings of [[Medieval philosophy]] (often forcefully, as under [[Justinian I#Suppression of religions|Justinian&nbsp;I]]), which was dominated by the three [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] traditions: [[Jewish philosophy]], [[Christian philosophy]], and [[early Islamic philosophy]]. In spite of this shift, Hellenistic philosophy continued to influence these three religious traditions and the [[Renaissance]] thought which followed them.\n\n===Sciences===\n\n[[File:Oxyrhynchus papyrus with Euclid's Elements.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.05|One of the oldest surviving fragments of Euclid's ''Elements'', found at [[Oxyrhynchus]] and dated to {{circa|AD&nbsp;100}} ([[Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 29|P.

Hellenistic science differed from Greek science in at least two ways: first, it benefited from the cross-fertilization of Greek ideas with those that had developed in the larger Hellenistic world; secondly, to some extent, it was supported by royal patrons in the kingdoms founded by Alexander's successors. Especially important to Hellenistic science was the city of Alexandria in Egypt, which became a major center of scientific research in the 3rd century BC.

Armies of the Hellenistic period differed from those of the classical period in being largely made up of professional soldiers and also in their greater specialization and technical proficiency in [[siege warfare]]. Hellenistic armies were significantly larger than those of classical Greece relying increasingly on Greek [[mercenaries]] (''misthophoroi''; men-for-pay) and also on non-Greek soldiery such as Thracians, Galatians, Egyptians and Iranians. Some ethnic groups were known for their martial skill in a particular mode of combat and were highly sought after, including [[Hellenistic armies#Tarantine cavalry|Tarantine cavalry]], Cretan archers, Rhodian slingers and Thracian [[peltasts]]. This period also saw the adoption of new weapons and troop types such as [[Thureophoroi]] and the [[Thorakitai]] who used the oval [[Thureos]] shield and fought with javelins and the [[machaira]] sword. The use of heavily armored [[cataphracts]] and also [[horse archers]] was adopted by the Seleucids, Greco-Bactrians, Armenians and [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontus]]. The use of [[war elephants]] also became common. Seleucus received Indian war elephants from the [[Mauryan empire]], and used them to good effect at the [[battle of Ipsus]]. He kept a core of 500 of them at [[Apamea (Euphrates)|Apameia]]. The Ptolemies used the smaller African elephant.\n[[File:Ancient Mechanical Artillery. Pic 01.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Ancient mechanical artillery: Catapults (standing), the chain drive of [[Polybolos]] (bottom center), [[Gastraphetes]] (on wall)]]\nHellenistic military equipment was generally characterized by an increase in size. [[Hellenistic-era warships]] grew from the [[trireme]] to include more banks of oars and larger numbers of rowers and soldiers as in the Quadrireme and Quinquereme. The Ptolemaic [[Tessarakonteres]] was the largest ship constructed in Antiquity. New siege engines were developed during this period. An unknown engineer developed the torsion-spring catapult ({{circa|360&nbsp;BC}}) and Dionysios of Alexandria designed a repeating [[ballista]], the [[Polybolos]].

In artistic terms this means that there is huge variety which is often put under the heading of \"Hellenistic Art\" for convenience.\n\nHellenistic art saw a turn from the idealistic, perfected, calm and composed figures of classical Greek art to a style dominated by [[Realism (arts)|realism]] and the depiction of emotion ([[pathos]]) and character ([[ethos]]). The motif of deceptively realistic [[Naturalism (arts)|naturalism]] in art (''aletheia'') is reflected in stories such as that of the painter [[Zeuxis]], who was said to have painted grapes that seemed so real that birds came and pecked at them.<ref>Green, Peter; Alexander to Actium, the historical evolution of the Hellenistic age, page 92.</ref> The [[female nude]] also became more popular as epitomized by the [[Aphrodite of Cnidos]] of [[Praxiteles]] and art in general became more erotic (e.g., [[Leda and the Swan#Eroticism|Leda and the Swan]] and [[Scopas#Pothos|Scopa's Pothos]]). The dominant ideals of Hellenistic art were those of sensuality and passion.<ref>Green (1990), p. 342.</ref>\n\nPeople of all ages and social statuses were depicted in the art of the Hellenistic age. Artists such as [[Peiraikos]] chose mundane and lower class subjects for his paintings. According to Pliny, \"He painted barbers' shops, cobblers' stalls, asses, eatables and similar subjects, earning for himself the name of ''rhyparographos'' [painter of dirt/low things]. In these subjects he could give consummate pleasure, selling them for more than other artists received for their large pictures\" ([[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]], Book XXXV.112). Even barbarians, such as the [[Galatia (Roman province)|Galatians]], were depicted in heroic form, prefiguring the artistic theme of the [[noble savage]]. The image of Alexander the Great was also an important artistic theme, and all of the diadochi had themselves depicted imitating Alexander's youthful look. A number of the best-known works of Greek sculpture belong to the Hellenistic period, including [[Laoco\u00f6n and his Sons]], [[Venus de Milo]], and the [[Winged Victory of Samothrace]].\n\nDevelopments in painting included experiments in [[chiaroscuro]] by [[Zeuxis]] and the development of [[landscape painting]] and [[still life]] painting.<ref>Green, Peter; Alexander to Actium, the historical evolution of the Hellenistic age, page 117\u2013118.</ref> Greek temples built during the Hellenistic period were generally larger than classical ones, such as the [[temple of Artemis]] at Ephesus, the temple of [[Artemis]] at [[Sardis]], and the temple of Apollo at Didyma (rebuilt by Seleucus in 300&nbsp;BC). The royal palace (''basileion'') also came into its own during the Hellenistic period, the first extant example being the massive 4th-century villa of Cassander at [[Vergina]].\n\nThis period also saw the first written works of [[art history]] in the histories of [[Duris of Samos]] and [[Xenocrates of Athens]], a sculptor and a historian of sculpture and painting.\n\nThere has been a trend in writing the history of this period to depict Hellenistic art as a decadent style, following the ''Golden Age'' of [[Classical Greece|Classical Athens]]. [[Pliny the Elder]], after having described the [[Greek sculpture|sculpture]] of the classical period, says: ''Cessavit deinde ars'' (\"then art disappeared\").<ref>[[Pliny the Elder]], ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' (XXXIV, 52)</ref> The 18th century terms ''[[Baroque]]'' and ''[[Rococo]]'' have sometimes been applied to the art of this complex and individual period. The renewal of the historiographical approach as well as some recent discoveries, such as the tombs of [[Vergina]], allow a better appreciation of this period's artistic richness.\n\n==Hellenistic period and modern culture==\n{{Further|Decadence|Degeneration}}\nThe focus on the Hellenistic period over the course of the 19th century by scholars and historians has led to an issue common to the study of historical periods; historians see the period of focus as a mirror of the period in which they are living. Many 19th-century scholars contended that the Hellenistic period represented a cultural decline from the brilliance of [[classical Greece]]. Though this comparison is now seen as unfair and meaningless, it has been noted that even commentators of the time saw the end of a cultural era which could not be matched again.<ref>Green, p. xv.</ref> This may be inextricably linked with the nature of government. It has been noted by [[Herodotus]] that after the establishment of the Athenian democracy:\n\n<blockquote>...the Athenians found themselves suddenly a great power. Not just in one field, but in everything they set their minds to...As subjects of a tyrant, what had they accomplished?...Held down like slaves they had shirked and slacked; once they had won their freedom, not a citizen but he could feel like he was labouring for himself\"<ref>Herodotus (Holland, T. ''Persian Fire'', p. 193.)</ref></blockquote>\n\nThus, with the decline of the Greek polis, and the establishment of monarchical states, the environment and social freedom in which to excel may have been reduced.<ref name=\"Green\">Green.</ref> A parallel can be drawn with the productivity of the city states of Italy during [[the Renaissance]], and their subsequent decline under autocratic rulers.\n\nHowever, [[William Woodthorpe Tarn]], between [[World War&nbsp;I]] and [[World War&nbsp;II]] and the heyday of the [[League of Nations]], focused on the issues of racial and cultural confrontation and the nature of colonial rule. [[Michael Rostovtzeff]], who fled the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], concentrated predominantly on the rise of the capitalist bourgeoisie in areas of Greek rule. [[Arnaldo Momigliano]], an [[Italian Jew]] who wrote before and after the Second World War, studied the problem of mutual understanding between races in the conquered areas. [[Moses Hadas]] portrayed an optimistic picture of synthesis of culture from the perspective of the 1950s, while [[Frank William Walbank]] in the 1960s and 1970s had a materialistic approach to the Hellenistic period, focusing mainly on class relations. Recently, however, [[papyrologist]] C. Pr\u00e9aux has concentrated predominantly on the economic system, interactions between kings and cities, and provides a generally pessimistic view on the period. [[Peter Green (historian)|Peter Green]], on the other hand, writes from the point of view of late-20th-century [[liberalism]], his focus being on [[individualism]], the breakdown of convention, experiments, and a postmodern disillusionment with all institutions and political processes.<ref name=\"autogenerated2007\">{{cite book |last=Green |first=Peter |year=2007 |title=The Hellenistic Age (A Short History) |location=New York |publisher=Modern Library Chronicles}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Greece}}\n{{col-float}}\n* [[Ancient Carthage]]\n* [[Dehellenization]]\n* [[Greco-Roman world]]\n* [[Han dynasty]]\n* [[Hellenism (Academia)]]\n* [[Hellenism (neoclassicism)]]\n* [[Hellenistic fortifications]]\n* [[Hellenistic glass]]\n* [[Kushan Empire]]{{col-float-break}}\n* [[La T\u00e8ne culture]]\n* [[Maurya Empire]]\n* [[Parthian Empire]]\n* [[Philhellenism]]\n* [[Pre-Roman Iron Age]]\n* [[Roman Republic]]\n* [[Scythians]]\n* [[Tashtyk culture]]\n{{col-float-end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*Austin, M.

African Parliament|twenty-seventh Parliament]] was first convened on 22 May 2019.\n\nFrom 1910 to 1994, members of Parliament were elected chiefly by the South African [[Whites in South Africa|white minority]].  The first elections with universal suffrage were held in [[South African general election, 1994|1994]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Before 1910===\n{{main|Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope}}\nThe predecessor of the Parliament of South Africa, before the 1910 [[Union of South Africa]], was the bicameral [[Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope]]. This was composed of the House of Assembly (the lower house) and the Legislative Council (the upper house). It dated back to the beginnings of Cape independence in 1853 and was elected according to the multi-racial [[Cape Qualified Franchise]] system, whereby suffrage qualifications were applied equally to all males, regardless of race.\n\nThe buildings of the Cape Parliament went on to house the Parliament of South Africa, after union.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/oldcapehousebein00kilpiala ''The old Cape House, being pages from the history of a legislative assembly''], Ralph Kilpin, T.M Miller, Cape Town, 1918</ref><ref>[http://www.andrewcusack.com/2009/11/03/die-parlementsgebou/ The Houses of Parliament, Cape Town], Andrew Cusack, 3 November 2009</ref>\n\n===1910 to 1961===\n{{anchor|1910|1930|1932}}<!-- Utilised by Template:Infobox legislation/images -->\nWhen the [[Union of South Africa]] was established in 1910,<ref name=saa>South Africa Act 1909</ref> the Parliament was [[bicameral]] and consisted of [[British monarch|the King]] or the [[Elizabeth II|Queen]], the [[Senate of South Africa|Senate]], and the [[House of Assembly of South Africa|House of Assembly]] (known in [[Afrikaans]] as the ''Volksraad'').\n* The King (from 1952, the [[Queen of South Africa]]) was represented by the [[Governor-General of South Africa|Governor-General]].\n* The Senate consisted of senators nominated by the four provinces, and by the Governor-General, initially for a period of ten years. The number of senators was changed from time to time. The Senate was chaired by a President of the Senate chosen by the senators from among themselves.\n* The House of Assembly consisted of members who were directly elected by the voters. Each MP represented an electoral district (constituency), and most of them were elected on the basis of their political party. The number of constituencies and parliamentary seats was increased from time to time, in line with increases in the population. The House was chaired by a Speaker chosen by the MPs from among themselves.\n* Only white men could be senators or MPs.\n* The franchise (right to vote) was originally granted to white men in all four provinces, to black men in the Cape Province and Natal, and to Coloured men in the Cape Province \u2013 in all cases, the minimum age was 21 years.\n\nThe composition of Parliament was changed by constitutional amendments from time to time:\n* From 1930, white women had the vote, and the right to serve as senators and MPs, on the same basis as white men.\n* In 1934, Parliament was declared \"the sovereign legislative power in and over the Union\".<ref name=sua>Status of the Union Act 1934</ref>\n* From 1937, black voters were separated from the other races \u2013 in the Senate they were represented by four elected senators (two for the Cape, one for Natal, one for the Orange Free State and Transvaal), and in the House of Assembly by three \"native representative\" MPs elected in separate black constituencies.<ref name=rna>Representation of Natives Act 1936</ref>\n* From 1950, white voters in [[South West Africa]], which was under South African administration at that time, were represented by four senators and six MPs.\n* From 1957, Coloured voters were separated from the whites \u2013 in the Senate, they were represented by separate senators, and in the House of Assembly by MPs elected in separate Coloured constituencies.<ref name=srva>Separate Representation of Voters Act 1956</ref> To pass this amendment in the face of strong opposition (and two Supreme Court rulings), prime minister [[Johannes Strijdom]] had to enlarge the Senate and appoint enough pro-government senators to get the two-thirds majority he needed to force through the constitutional change.<ref name=sa>Senate Act 1955</ref>\n* Representation of black voters was ended in 1960.\n* Voting age was lowered from 21 to 18 in 1960.\n\nIn a referendum held in 1960, a small majority of the white voters approved the conversion of the country from a Realm or Dominion of the British Commonwealth to a republic.\n\n===1961 to 1984===\n[[File:Coat of arms of the Parliament of South Africa 1932-2000.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Coat of arms of the Parliament of South Africa 1964\u20132007<ref>[http://www.hubert-herald.nl/RSA.htm REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA] Hubert de Vries.</ref>]]\nThe Republic of South Africa was established in 1961. The only change made to the composition of the Parliament was the substitution of the [[State President of South Africa|State President]] for the Queen.<ref name=rsaca>Republic of South Africa Constitution Act 1961</ref> A few significant changes were made later:\n* Coloured representation was ended in 1968, leaving both the Senate and the House of Assembly representing white voters only.\n* South West Africa ceased to be represented in Parliament from 1977.<ref>[http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/arc/SOUTH_AFRICA_1977_E.PDF SOUTH AFRICA Date of Elections: November 30, 1977], [[Inter-Parliamentary-Union]]</ref>\n* The Senate was abolished in 1981, changing Parliament to a [[unicameral legislature]].\n\n===1984 to 1994===\n{{Main|Tricameral Parliament}}\n\nA new Constitution, introduced in 1984, re-enfranchised the Coloured population (women as well as men) and enfranchised the Indian population. It retained the existing House of Assembly for whites and established a House of Representatives to represent the Coloureds, and a House of Delegates for the Indians, making Parliament a tricameral legislature. Blacks continued to be excluded.\n* Each house consisted of members elected to represent constituencies, plus a few additional members elected by the MPs, and some nominated by the State President.\n* Each house legislated on \"own affairs\" exclusive to its own race group, and they legislated jointly on \"general affairs\" affecting all races.<ref name=rsac>Republic of South Africa Constitution Act 1983</ref> In practice, the House of Assembly, which had more MPs than the other two houses combined, continued to dominate the legislature.\n* Each house was chaired by a chairman elected by its members from among themselves. They were coordinated by a Speaker of Parliament, elected by the members of all three houses in a joint sitting.\n* The existing House of Assembly, elected in 1981, was deemed to have been re-elected in 1984, to coordinate its term of office with those of the two new houses. However, this was later overturned by the Supreme Court, and a separate election had to be held for the House of Assembly in 1987. The House elected in 1987 was then dissolved with the other houses in 1989.\n\nThe black majority were still disfranchised, and the new system lacked legitimacy even among the Coloureds and Asians, many of whom boycotted elections. In a [[South African apartheid referendum, 1992|referendum held in 1992]], 68.73% of (only white) voters approved the reform process that effectively ended Apartheid. In late 1993, one of the last pieces of legislation passed by the tricameral Parliament was the [[Interim Constitution of South Africa|Interim Constitution]], which took effect on 27 April 1994, the same day as the first non-racial elections.\n\n===Since 1994===\n\nA new [[interim]] constitution, introduced in 1994 after four years of negotiation, finally introduced all-race democracy and enfranchised men and women of all races on equal terms, the minimum age remaining 18 years. Parliament was reconstituted to consist of a [[Senate of South Africa|Senate]] and a [[National Assembly (South Africa)|National Assembly]]. \n* The Senate consisted of 90 senators, ten nominated by each of the nine provinces. It was chaired by a President of the Senate elected by the senators from among themselves.\n*The National Assembly consists of 400 members, elected by voters on a proportional representation/party list system. There are no electoral districts, and each party is allocated a number of seats proportionate to the percentage of the votes it receives across the country. It is chaired by a Speaker elected by the MPs from among themselves.\n* In 1997, the current [[Constitution of South Africa]] came into force, in which the Senate was replaced by a 90-member [[National Council of Provinces]] (NCOP), made up of a 10-member delegation from each province (six delegates elected by the [[provincial legislature (South Africa)|provincial legislature]], the [[Premier (South Africa)|Premier]] and three other members of the provincial legislature). The NCOP is chaired by a Chairperson elected by the members from among themselves.\n\nThe parliamentary system uses proportional representation, with voters voting for political parties rather than for candidates. Proportional representation allows for smaller parties to have a chance of acquiring seats in parliament, although these parties often combine in order to have a stronger voice within the political system, especially against the ANC. The Independent Electoral Commission is charged with keeping elections fair, regular, and equal. Parties submit closed lists of candidates to the IEC, and the IEC fills the seats allotted to individual parties using the candidate lists after election results come in. The electoral system has seen little corruption since 1994. \n\n[[Minister of Higher Education and Training (South Africa)|Higher Education Minister]] [[Naledi Pandor]] has noted that during her term (starting 1994) a decline in political respectability had occurred in parliament, due to its members not engaging with one another in a courteous manner. She remarked that she felt undignified to be an observer of the crude behaviour, which also inhibited the conduct of successful politics.<ref name=\"cdup\">{{cite news |last1=du Plessis |first1=Carien |title=Naledi Pandor: 'Work has to go on, the nation has to continue to exist' |url=https://www.msn.com/en-za/news/politics/naledi-pandor-\u2018work-has-to-go-on-the-nation-has-to-continue-to-exist\u2019/ar-BBQMl3g?ocid=spartanntp |accessdate=11 December 2018 |agency=Daily Maverick |date=2018-12-10}}</ref>\n\n==Major political parties in parliament==\n[[African National Congress]]: The ANC was founded in 1912, but were banned by [[Charles Robberts Swart]] in 1960, remaining so until the ban was lifted thirty years later by [[F. W. De Klerk]]. The ANC became the leading political party in South Africa after the first multiracial election in 1994. The party's main platform rests on working towards racial equality and eradicating the socioeconomic classes which are often based on race. The ANC has been considered a party for native South Africans, especially before 2009 when party leader [[Jacob Zuma]] faced multiple accusations regarding corruption, particularly using public funds for his own purposes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.corruptionwatch.org.za/can-we-blame-you-now-president-zuma/|title=Can we blame you now, President Zuma? {{!}} Corruption Watch|date=2015-04-07|website=Corruption Watch|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-05-06}}</ref> The economic difficulties in South Africa, as well as police brutality have both been blamed on the ANC. Currently, the ANC holds 230 seats in parliament. Support for the ANC went down between the 2014 and the 2019 general elections, with violent protests erupting all over the country in response to the allegations of corruption within the ANC.\n\n[[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]]: The DA formed when the New National Party, the successor to the apartheid-era National Party, merged with the Democratic Party and the Federal Alliance in 2000 to form an alliance. The DA is the opposition party and has been traditionally supported by South Africa's minority communities (White, Coloured and Indian). In more recent years, the party has attempted to win votes from Black South Africans and as a result Black support for the DA has risen over the past several years, going from 1% to 6%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2014/05/09/south-africa-election-results-2014|title=South Africa election results 2014|last=Sapa|first=TimesLIVE|website=Times LIVE|access-date=2016-05-06}}</ref> The DA is a liberal party that favours free market policies. The DA was allotted 89 seats in parliament after the 2014 general election, but the party's seat total decreased to 84 seats following the 2019 general election.\n\n[[Economic Freedom Fighters]]: The EFF emerged eight months before the 2014 general election and won 25 seats in parliament. The EFF is a racist party which is pro-black. After the 2019 general elections, the EFF  increased their seats in parliament to 44, the only party of the top three parties that achieved an increase of members in parliament. The EFF is a far-left revolutionary socialist political party, advocating for land expropriation and for an end to corruption within parliament. The EFF has been widely accused of inflammatory hate speech against White and Indian South Africans.\n\n[[Inkatha Freedom Party]]: The IFP which was formed in 1990 which was the successor to the former government in the now defunct Kwazulu bantustan traditionally draws it support from the Zulu people and has however made inroads into the minority electorate of Whites and Indians. The Ifp was the third largest-party until it was unseated by the EFF and is one of the few parties to have consecutive representation in parliment since democracy in 1994. The IFP apart from the ANC was part of National Government for 10 years. The IFP champions the rights of traditional leaders and advocates for policies which favour free markets, the party is opposed to socialism and communist policies.\n\nBecause the ANC has such a large majority of parliament, smaller parties are constantly forming alliances and coalitions in order to act as a stronger opposition to the ANC-run legislative and executive branches.\n\n==Seat of Parliament==\n[[File:National Assembly of South Africa 2007.jpg|thumb|left|The [[debate chamber|chamber]] of the National Assembly]]\nParliament sits in [[Cape Town]], even though the seat of government is in [[Pretoria]]. This dates back to the foundation of the Union, when there was disagreement among the four provinces as to which city would be the national capital. As a compromise, Cape Town was designated the ''legislative'' capital, [[Bloemfontein]] the ''judicial'' capital, and Pretoria the ''administrative'' capital. The [[African National Congress]] (ANC) government has proposed moving Parliament to Pretoria, arguing that the present arrangement is cumbersome as ministers, civil servants and diplomats must move back and forth when Parliament is in session.\n\nHowever, many Capetonians have spoken out against such a move, accusing the ANC of trying to centralise power. Under the Constitution, there is provision for Parliament to sit elsewhere than Cape Town on grounds of public interest, security or convenience and Parliament is permitted to provide in its rules and orders for sittings outside Cape Town. Rule 24 of the National Assembly Rules accordingly allows the Speaker to direct that the House will sit at 'a place other than the Houses of Parliament in Cape Town' after consulting the Leader of the House and the Chief Whip of each party represented in the House. Rule 23 of the rules of the National Council of Provinces allows the Council to pass a resolution providing for it to sit elsewhere.\n\n==List of Parliaments==\n\n===Parliaments of the Union===\n* [[1st South African Parliament]] (1910\u20131915) \u2013 majority party : [[South African Party]]\n* [[2nd South African Parliament]] (1915\u20131920) \u2013 majority party : South African Party\n* [[3rd South African Parliament]] (1920\u20131921) \u2013 majority party : South African Party\n* [[4th South African Parliament]] (1921\u20131924) \u2013 majority party : South African Party\n* [[5th South African Parliament]] (1924\u20131929) \u2013 majority party : [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]]\n* [[6th South African Parliament]] (1929\u20131933) \u2013 majority party : National Party\n* [[7th South African Parliament]] (1933\u20131938) \u2013 majority party : [[United Party (South Africa)|United Party]]\n* [[8th South African Parliament]] (1938\u20131943) \u2013 majority party : United Party\n* [[9th South African Parliament]] (1943\u20131948) \u2013 majority party : United Party\n* [[10th South African Parliament]] (1948\u20131953) \u2013 majority party : National Party\n* [[11th South African Parliament]] (1953\u20131958) \u2013 majority party : National Party\n* [[12th South African Parliament]] (1958\u20131961) \u2013 majority party : National Party\n\n===Parliaments of the Republic===\n* [[13th South African Parliament]] (1961\u20131966) \u2013 majority party : National Party\n* [[14th South African Parliament]] (1966\u20131970) \u2013 majority party : National Party\n* [[15th South African Parliament]] (1970\u20131974) \u2013 majority party : National Party\n* [[16th South African Parliament]] (1974\u20131977) \u2013 majority party : National Party\n* [[17th South African Parliament]] (1977\u20131981) \u2013 majority party : National Party\n* [[18th South African Parliament]] (1981\u20131984) \u2013 majority party : National Party\n* [[19th South African Parliament]] (1984\u20131987) \u2013 majority party : National Party\n* [[20th South African Parliament]] (1987\u20131989) \u2013 majority party : National Party\n* [[21st South African Parliament]] (1989\u20131994) \u2013 majority party : National Party\n* [[22nd South African Parliament]] (1994\u20131999) \u2013 majority party : [[African National Congress]]\n* [[23rd South African Parliament]] (1999\u20132004) \u2013 majority party : African National Congress\n* [[24th South African Parliament]] (2004\u20132009) \u2013 majority party : African National Congress\n* [[25th South African Parliament]] (2009\u20132014) \u2013 majority party : African National Congress\n* [[26th South African Parliament]] (2014\u20132019) - majority party : African National Congress\n* [[27th South African Parliament]] (2019\u2013present) - majority party: African National Congress\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Acts of the Parliament of South Africa]]\n* [[Politics of South Africa]]\n* [[List of legislatures by country]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n* South Africa Act 1909\n* Constitution of the Republic of South Africa 1961\n* Constitution of the Republic of South Africa 1983\n* Constitution of the Republic of South Africa 1993\n* Constitution of the Republic of South Africa 1996\n* Kahn, E.

African Parliament|twenty-seventh Parliament]] was first convened on 22 May 2019.\n\nFrom 1910 to 1994, members of Parliament were elected chiefly by the South African [[Whites in South Africa|white minority]].  The first elections with universal suffrage were held in [[South African general election, 1994|1994]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Before 1910===\n{{main|Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope}}\nThe predecessor of the Parliament of South Africa, before the 1910 [[Union of South Africa]], was the bicameral [[Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope]]. This was composed of the House of Assembly (the lower house) and the Legislative Council (the upper house). It dated back to the beginnings of Cape independence in 1853 and was elected according to the multi-racial [[Cape Qualified Franchise]] system, whereby suffrage qualifications were applied equally to all males, regardless of race.\n\nThe buildings of the Cape Parliament went on to house the Parliament of South Africa, after union.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/oldcapehousebein00kilpiala ''The old Cape House, being pages from the history of a legislative assembly''], Ralph Kilpin, T.M Miller, Cape Town, 1918</ref><ref>[http://www.andrewcusack.com/2009/11/03/die-parlementsgebou/ The Houses of Parliament, Cape Town], Andrew Cusack, 3 November 2009</ref>\n\n===1910 to 1961===\n{{anchor|1910|1930|1932}}<!-- Utilised by Template:Infobox legislation/images -->\nWhen the [[Union of South Africa]] was established in 1910,<ref name=saa>South Africa Act 1909</ref> the Parliament was [[bicameral]] and consisted of [[British monarch|the King]] or the [[Elizabeth II|Queen]], the [[Senate of South Africa|Senate]], and the [[House of Assembly of South Africa|House of Assembly]] (known in [[Afrikaans]] as the ''Volksraad'').\n* The King (from 1952, the [[Queen of South Africa]]) was represented by the [[Governor-General of South Africa|Governor-General]].\n* The Senate consisted of senators nominated by the four provinces, and by the Governor-General, initially for a period of ten years. The number of senators was changed from time to time. The Senate was chaired by a President of the Senate chosen by the senators from among themselves.\n* The House of Assembly consisted of members who were directly elected by the voters. Each MP represented an electoral district (constituency), and most of them were elected on the basis of their political party. The number of constituencies and parliamentary seats was increased from time to time, in line with increases in the population. The House was chaired by a Speaker chosen by the MPs from among themselves.\n* Only white men could be senators or MPs.\n* The franchise (right to vote) was originally granted to white men in all four provinces, to black men in the Cape Province and Natal, and to Coloured men in the Cape Province \u2013 in all cases, the minimum age was 21 years.\n\nThe composition of Parliament was changed by constitutional amendments from time to time:\n* From 1930, white women had the vote, and the right to serve as senators and MPs, on the same basis as white men.\n* In 1934, Parliament was declared \"the sovereign legislative power in and over the Union\".<ref name=sua>Status of the Union Act 1934</ref>\n* From 1937, black voters were separated from the other races \u2013 in the Senate they were represented by four elected senators (two for the Cape, one for Natal, one for the Orange Free State and Transvaal), and in the House of Assembly by three \"native representative\" MPs elected in separate black constituencies.<ref name=rna>Representation of Natives Act 1936</ref>\n* From 1950, white voters in [[South West Africa]], which was under South African administration at that time, were represented by four senators and six MPs.\n* From 1957, Coloured voters were separated from the whites \u2013 in the Senate, they were represented by separate senators, and in the House of Assembly by MPs elected in separate Coloured constituencies.<ref name=srva>Separate Representation of Voters Act 1956</ref> To pass this amendment in the face of strong opposition (and two Supreme Court rulings), prime minister [[Johannes Strijdom]] had to enlarge the Senate and appoint enough pro-government senators to get the two-thirds majority he needed to force through the constitutional change.<ref name=sa>Senate Act 1955</ref>\n* Representation of black voters was ended in 1960.\n* Voting age was lowered from 21 to 18 in 1960.\n\nIn a referendum held in 1960, a small majority of the white voters approved the conversion of the country from a Realm or Dominion of the British Commonwealth to a republic.\n\n===1961 to 1984===\n[[File:Coat of arms of the Parliament of South Africa 1932-2000.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Coat of arms of the Parliament of South Africa 1964\u20132007<ref>[http://www.hubert-herald.nl/RSA.htm REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA] Hubert de Vries.</ref>]]\nThe Republic of South Africa was established in 1961. The only change made to the composition of the Parliament was the substitution of the [[State President of South Africa|State President]] for the Queen.<ref name=rsaca>Republic of South Africa Constitution Act 1961</ref> A few significant changes were made later:\n* Coloured representation was ended in 1968, leaving both the Senate and the House of Assembly representing white voters only.\n* South West Africa ceased to be represented in Parliament from 1977.<ref>[http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/arc/SOUTH_AFRICA_1977_E.PDF SOUTH AFRICA Date of Elections: November 30, 1977], [[Inter-Parliamentary-Union]]</ref>\n* The Senate was abolished in 1981, changing Parliament to a [[unicameral legislature]].\n\n===1984 to 1994===\n{{Main|Tricameral Parliament}}\n\nA new Constitution, introduced in 1984, re-enfranchised the Coloured population (women as well as men) and enfranchised the Indian population. It retained the existing House of Assembly for whites and established a House of Representatives to represent the Coloureds, and a House of Delegates for the Indians, making Parliament a tricameral legislature. Blacks continued to be excluded.\n* Each house consisted of members elected to represent constituencies, plus a few additional members elected by the MPs, and some nominated by the State President.\n* Each house legislated on \"own affairs\" exclusive to its own race group, and they legislated jointly on \"general affairs\" affecting all races.<ref name=rsac>Republic of South Africa Constitution Act 1983</ref> In practice, the House of Assembly, which had more MPs than the other two houses combined, continued to dominate the legislature.\n* Each house was chaired by a chairman elected by its members from among themselves. They were coordinated by a Speaker of Parliament, elected by the members of all three houses in a joint sitting.\n* The existing House of Assembly, elected in 1981, was deemed to have been re-elected in 1984, to coordinate its term of office with those of the two new houses. However, this was later overturned by the Supreme Court, and a separate election had to be held for the House of Assembly in 1987. The House elected in 1987 was then dissolved with the other houses in 1989.\n\nThe black majority were still disfranchised, and the new system lacked legitimacy even among the Coloureds and Asians, many of whom boycotted elections. In a [[South African apartheid referendum, 1992|referendum held in 1992]], 68.73% of (only white) voters approved the reform process that effectively ended Apartheid. In late 1993, one of the last pieces of legislation passed by the tricameral Parliament was the [[Interim Constitution of South Africa|Interim Constitution]], which took effect on 27 April 1994, the same day as the first non-racial elections.\n\n===Since 1994===\n\nA new [[interim]] constitution, introduced in 1994 after four years of negotiation, finally introduced all-race democracy and enfranchised men and women of all races on equal terms, the minimum age remaining 18 years. Parliament was reconstituted to consist of a [[Senate of South Africa|Senate]] and a [[National Assembly (South Africa)|National Assembly]]. \n* The Senate consisted of 90 senators, ten nominated by each of the nine provinces. It was chaired by a President of the Senate elected by the senators from among themselves.\n*The National Assembly consists of 400 members, elected by voters on a proportional representation/party list system. There are no electoral districts, and each party is allocated a number of seats proportionate to the percentage of the votes it receives across the country. It is chaired by a Speaker elected by the MPs from among themselves.\n* In 1997, the current [[Constitution of South Africa]] came into force, in which the Senate was replaced by a 90-member [[National Council of Provinces]] (NCOP), made up of a 10-member delegation from each province (six delegates elected by the [[provincial legislature (South Africa)|provincial legislature]], the [[Premier (South Africa)|Premier]] and three other members of the provincial legislature). The NCOP is chaired by a Chairperson elected by the members from among themselves.\n\nThe parliamentary system uses proportional representation, with voters voting for political parties rather than for candidates. Proportional representation allows for smaller parties to have a chance of acquiring seats in parliament, although these parties often combine in order to have a stronger voice within the political system, especially against the ANC. The Independent Electoral Commission is charged with keeping elections fair, regular, and equal. Parties submit closed lists of candidates to the IEC, and the IEC fills the seats allotted to individual parties using the candidate lists after election results come in. The electoral system has seen little corruption since 1994. \n\n[[Minister of Higher Education and Training (South Africa)|Higher Education Minister]] [[Naledi Pandor]] has noted that during her term (starting 1994) a decline in political respectability had occurred in parliament, due to its members not engaging with one another in a courteous manner. She remarked that she felt undignified to be an observer of the crude behaviour, which also inhibited the conduct of successful politics.<ref name=\"cdup\">{{cite news |last1=du Plessis |first1=Carien |title=Naledi Pandor: 'Work has to go on, the nation has to continue to exist' |url=https://www.msn.com/en-za/news/politics/naledi-pandor-\u2018work-has-to-go-on-the-nation-has-to-continue-to-exist\u2019/ar-BBQMl3g?ocid=spartanntp |accessdate=11 December 2018 |agency=Daily Maverick |date=2018-12-10}}</ref>\n\n==Major political parties in parliament==\n[[African National Congress]]: The ANC was founded in 1912, but were banned by [[Charles Robberts Swart]] in 1960, remaining so until the ban was lifted thirty years later by [[F. W. De Klerk]]. The ANC became the leading political party in South Africa after the first multiracial election in 1994. The party's main platform rests on working towards racial equality and eradicating the socioeconomic classes which are often based on race. The ANC has been considered a party for native South Africans, especially before 2009 when party leader [[Jacob Zuma]] faced multiple accusations regarding corruption, particularly using public funds for his own purposes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.corruptionwatch.org.za/can-we-blame-you-now-president-zuma/|title=Can we blame you now, President Zuma? {{!}} Corruption Watch|date=2015-04-07|website=Corruption Watch|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-05-06}}</ref> The economic difficulties in South Africa, as well as police brutality have both been blamed on the ANC. Currently, the ANC holds 230 seats in parliament. Support for the ANC went down between the 2014 and the 2019 general elections, with violent protests erupting all over the country in response to the allegations of corruption within the ANC.\n\n[[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]]: The DA formed when the New National Party, the successor to the apartheid-era National Party, merged with the Democratic Party and the Federal Alliance in 2000 to form an alliance. The DA is the opposition party and has been traditionally supported by South Africa's minority communities (White, Coloured and Indian). In more recent years, the party has attempted to win votes from Black South Africans and as a result Black support for the DA has risen over the past several years, going from 1% to 6%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2014/05/09/south-africa-election-results-2014|title=South Africa election results 2014|last=Sapa|first=TimesLIVE|website=Times LIVE|access-date=2016-05-06}}</ref> The DA is a liberal party that favours free market policies. The DA was allotted 89 seats in parliament after the 2014 general election, but the party's seat total decreased to 84 seats following the 2019 general election.\n\n[[Economic Freedom Fighters]]: The EFF emerged eight months before the 2014 general election and won 25 seats in parliament. After the 2019 general elections, the EFF  increased their seats in parliament to 44, the only party of the top three parties that achieved an increase of members in parliament. The EFF is a far-left revolutionary socialist political party, advocating for land expropriation and for an end to corruption within parliament. The EFF has been widely accused of inflammatory hate speech against White and Indian South Africans.\n\n[[Inkatha Freedom Party]]: The IFP which was formed in 1990 which was the successor to the former government in the now defunct Kwazulu bantustan traditionally draws it support from the Zulu people and has however made inroads into the minority electorate of Whites and Indians. The Ifp was the third largest-party until it was unseated by the EFF and is one of the few parties to have consecutive representation in parliment since democracy in 1994. The IFP apart from the ANC was part of National Government for 10 years. The IFP champions the rights of traditional leaders and advocates for policies which favour free markets, the party is opposed to socialism and communist policies.\n\nBecause the ANC has such a large majority of parliament, smaller parties are constantly forming alliances and coalitions in order to act as a stronger opposition to the ANC-run legislative and executive branches.\n\n==Seat of Parliament==\n[[File:National Assembly of South Africa 2007.jpg|thumb|left|The [[debate chamber|chamber]] of the National Assembly]]\nParliament sits in [[Cape Town]], even though the seat of government is in [[Pretoria]]. This dates back to the foundation of the Union, when there was disagreement among the four provinces as to which city would be the national capital. As a compromise, Cape Town was designated the ''legislative'' capital, [[Bloemfontein]] the ''judicial'' capital, and Pretoria the ''administrative'' capital. The [[African National Congress]] (ANC) government has proposed moving Parliament to Pretoria, arguing that the present arrangement is cumbersome as ministers, civil servants and diplomats must move back and forth when Parliament is in session.\n\nHowever, many Capetonians have spoken out against such a move, accusing the ANC of trying to centralise power. Under the Constitution, there is provision for Parliament to sit elsewhere than Cape Town on grounds of public interest, security or convenience and Parliament is permitted to provide in its rules and orders for sittings outside Cape Town. Rule 24 of the National Assembly Rules accordingly allows the Speaker to direct that the House will sit at 'a place other than the Houses of Parliament in Cape Town' after consulting the Leader of the House and the Chief Whip of each party represented in the House. Rule 23 of the rules of the National Council of Provinces allows the Council to pass a resolution providing for it to sit elsewhere.\n\n==List of Parliaments==\n\n===Parliaments of the Union===\n* [[1st South African Parliament]] (1910\u20131915) \u2013 majority party : [[South African Party]]\n* [[2nd South African Parliament]] (1915\u20131920) \u2013 majority party : South African Party\n* [[3rd South African Parliament]] (1920\u20131921) \u2013 majority party : South African Party\n* [[4th South African Parliament]] (1921\u20131924) \u2013 majority party : South African Party\n* [[5th South African Parliament]] (1924\u20131929) \u2013 majority party : [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]]\n* [[6th South African Parliament]] (1929\u20131933) \u2013 majority party : National Party\n* [[7th South African Parliament]] (1933\u20131938) \u2013 majority party : [[United Party (South Africa)|United Party]]\n* [[8th South African Parliament]] (1938\u20131943) \u2013 majority party : United Party\n* [[9th South African Parliament]] (1943\u20131948) \u2013 majority party : United Party\n* [[10th South African Parliament]] (1948\u20131953) \u2013 majority party : National Party\n* [[11th South African Parliament]] (1953\u20131958) \u2013 majority party : National Party\n* [[12th South African Parliament]] (1958\u20131961) \u2013 majority party : National Party\n\n===Parliaments of the Republic===\n* [[13th South African Parliament]] (1961\u20131966) \u2013 majority party : National Party\n* [[14th South African Parliament]] (1966\u20131970) \u2013 majority party : National Party\n* [[15th South African Parliament]] (1970\u20131974) \u2013 majority party : National Party\n* [[16th South African Parliament]] (1974\u20131977) \u2013 majority party : National Party\n* [[17th South African Parliament]] (1977\u20131981) \u2013 majority party : National Party\n* [[18th South African Parliament]] (1981\u20131984) \u2013 majority party : National Party\n* [[19th South African Parliament]] (1984\u20131987) \u2013 majority party : National Party\n* [[20th South African Parliament]] (1987\u20131989) \u2013 majority party : National Party\n* [[21st South African Parliament]] (1989\u20131994) \u2013 majority party : National Party\n* [[22nd South African Parliament]] (1994\u20131999) \u2013 majority party : [[African National Congress]]\n* [[23rd South African Parliament]] (1999\u20132004) \u2013 majority party : African National Congress\n* [[24th South African Parliament]] (2004\u20132009) \u2013 majority party : African National Congress\n* [[25th South African Parliament]] (2009\u20132014) \u2013 majority party : African National Congress\n* [[26th South African Parliament]] (2014\u20132019) - majority party : African National Congress\n* [[27th South African Parliament]] (2019\u2013present) - majority party: African National Congress\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Acts of the Parliament of South Africa]]\n* [[Politics of South Africa]]\n* [[List of legislatures by country]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n* South Africa Act 1909\n* Constitution of the Republic of South Africa 1961\n* Constitution of the Republic of South Africa 1983\n* Constitution of the Republic of South Africa 1993\n* Constitution of the Republic of South Africa 1996\n* Kahn, E.

Quoc Trung distinguishes himself as a man of vision with innovative approaches in the Music business. His creative works set the standards for Vietnamese pop culture and inspires numerous contemporaries and emerging artists.\n\n==Recent activities and on-going projects==\nA deep thinker and visionary, Quoc Trung yearns to reach out as far as his music with take him, beyond his birth country all the while introducing current new sounds to music listeners in Vietnam. One of his goals is moving the Vietnamese music industry towards more standardized practices with intellectual property and copyright laws.

He has taken part in esteemed music festivals such as the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] - [[France]], [[Roskilde Music Festival]] - [[Denmark]] and many other festivals in [[Asia]].  He recently announced he is gearing up to put forward Music Festivals in Vietnam that will bring more international music and performers from other parts of the globe. His Work and experience include:\n\n''The Hanoi Monsoon Music Festival'' 2014 is a 3-day event of live performances of various musical genres. With over 100 performers ranging from foreign and local artists such as Julien Sato (France), Dj Van Cliffe (Japan), 9Bach (Wales), Benjamin Schoos (Belgium), Carpark North (Denmark), Lulu Rouge (Denmark), Dominic Miller (UK-Argentina), Yi Sung Yol (South Korea).

Although his best contestant, Ha My, did not win the title, her songs, performances, sound arrangements under Quoc Trung's guidance showcased the artist's soul depth and maturity which were appreciated by more seasoned music listeners and audiophiles. With help from his collaborator/assistant  the talented female musician Thien Huong Luu, Quoc Trung team\u2019s contestants performances were most memorable throughout the episodes of season II.\n\n''The Roots'' is a cross-cultural project in collaboration with French-Vietnamese jazz guitarist [[Nguyen Le]]. The duo aim to bring Vietnamese folk sounds to a wider audience with the release of two albums in 2013 and through performances at international music festivals. This project was officially launched with a concert, billed as Kh\u1edfi Ngu\u1ed3n (The Roots- Beginning) on September 1, 2012 at the prestigious venue [[Hanoi Opera House]]. Alongside Quoc Trung and Nguyen Le, the concert featured Vietnamese pop diva Thanh Lam, traditional opera singer Kieu Anh, Tunisian musician Dhafer Youssef, and German percussion artist Rhani Krija.\n\nJudge for ''[[Vietnam Idol]]'', the televised singing competition (season 2010 and 2012). A veteran producer and well regarded by his peers, Quoc Trung first appeared on the 3rd season of Vietnam Idol in 2010. He is since dubbed and apprehended by many contestants as Sir Difficult due to his sharp observation, keen ears and unequivocal comments.

Being descendant of performers-artistes, born and raised in [[Hanoi]], Quoc Trung is considered a late-boomer musically, his musical sensibility only became apparent in his early teens, which is uncommon for a child of similar upbringing.\n\n==Academic Study==\nHis parents wanted Quoc Trung to follow the path of classical music. Despite his father's intent, young Quoc Trung rather played with his friends, and had only begun to seriously study classical piano at age 12. Quoc Trung progressed quickly with high marks. Unlike his father, a reputable tenor in classical and semi-classical, young Quoc Trung revealed an affinity for Pop music and sound-arrangement.  He opted to pursuit his passion and graduated from the Faculty of Composition at the Hanoi Conservatory of Music.  Quoc Trung was then sent for 2 years to National Music Academy of [[Sofia]] in [[Bulgaria]] for advanced learning. The National Music Academy of Sofia was unique and renowned musical institution of the Pop genre, in the then communist/socialist countries.\n\n==Personal and Love life==\nQuoc Trung and his wife Thanh Lam knew each other since childhood. When they fell in love they became the inspirational driving force behind each other's rising,  fame and success. Upon returning to Ha Noi, Vietnam in 1991, Quoc Trung founded a music band with like-minded musicians called The Orient. Within two years of its creation, The Orient reached the top spot in the National Music Band Festival. Through Quoc Trung's leadership he transformed the band into the most popular band in North Vietnam. For over a decade, Quoc Trung and his bandmates produced and propelled singer Thanh Lam to stardom and Queen of Pop status, being the first Vietnamese female singer with own band. As the Diva\u2019s singing performances and career gradually won over public's adulation, so grew the popularity of Quoc Trung and The Orient band from the North Vietnam to South Vietnam over the years.\n\nUnlike their art and collaboration in work that continues until today, the couple separated in 2004, after ten years. Both parted their own ways to collaborate with different entourage and artists. Ex-wife Thanh Lam bears two children s, a boy and a girl 17 and 19 as of 2015. Quoc Trung went on to build a major recording studio, produced most of Vietnam\u2019s biggest singing stars for more than 20 years.\n\nQuoc Trung remained single father for several years after the separation with his first-wife Thanh Lam. He finally found another half and is currently happy in a relationship with a women who can make his heart sings again.\n\n==Influences and Styles==\nThe distinct impression about Quoc Trung is that he possesses the ability to fuse and fine-tuning traditional Vietnamese sounds with modern electronic influences without losing his original pop and folklore identity. Quoc Trung incorporates many Vietnamese traditional strings instruments (Dan Bau, Dan Tranh, Dan Co, etc.), which he blends with digital mixers, samplers, and current Western instruments to create new revitalized tunes. As Quoc Trung gained more experience and exposure over the years in his musical journey, his style evolved and transitioned to what are now considered world/electronic/experimental/ambient/lounge all the while preserving his strong ties to the Vietnamese traditional instruments and sounds.\n\nQuoc Trung has said to be influenced by [[Phil Colins]], [[Peter Gabriel]], [[Annie Lennox]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[Moby]], [[Massive Attack]], [[The Prodigy]], [[Richard Bona]], [[Bj\u00f6rk]], [[Air (French band)]] etc.\n\n==Achievements==\nThroughout his lifetime Quoc Trung has received a wide range of honours and awards. His reputation firmly established as the top producer and musical authority in Vietnam's music industry. His opinions are flag-bearers and are well respected by the public, professional musicians, artists and producers. In 2012, Quoc Trung was very vocal about the digital intellectual property copyright issue and the distribution of music on Internet websites, who freely broadcast tracks from new Albums with no regards to the artists and their copyrights in Vietnam. He admitted that this is a worldwide problem for the entertainment industry and not unique to Vietnam. His contestation proved to bring results as the Vietnam government starts to clench, regulate and apply profit sharing barometers between these online websites and recording artists.\n\nBeside working as a producer, arranger, music director for shows and festivals, Quoc Trung has also ventured in to the cinema and TV, composed soundtrack commercials, most notably for the [[Sony]] brand. He has written music for a number of Asian feature films. His music was even played in the official ads for [[Vietnam Airlines]].\n\n==Collaborators==\n[[Thanh Lam]], [[Duong Thu]], [[Niels Lan Doky]], [[Nguyen Le]], Martin Hedin, [[Dhafer Youssef]], Rhani Krija, Hong Nhung, [[Stephan Eicher]], [[T\u00f9ng D\u01b0\u01a1ng]], [[Xavier Desandre Navarre]], Bui Huy Tuan, Manu Katche, Truong Anh Quan,\nBent Bitte Iversen, [[My Linh]], [[Tran Thu Ha]], [[Uyen Linh]] and others.\n\n==Discography==\nThe Roots (2012) - V\u00f2ng Tr\u00f2n (2011) - Wishing Upon the Moon (2011) - Nh\u01b0 c\u00e1nh v\u1ea1c bay (2006) - Road to Infinity (2005) - Khu v\u01b0\u1eddn y\u00ean t\u0129nh (2004) - M\u1ed9t ng\u00e0y m\u1edbi (2003) and more previous works.\n\n==Conclusion==\nQuoc Trung is also known as a devoted recording studio builder.

Collecting and redistributing studio equipment remain his hobby and it also what keeps this veteran young at heart.

Beatrice, niece of Leonato, a governor of Messina, asks the messenger about Benedick and makes sarcastic remarks about his ineptitude as a soldier. Leonato explains that \"There is a kind of merry war betwixt Signor Benedick and her.\"<ref name=\"shakespeare-navigators.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.shakespeare-navigators.com/ado/AdoText11.html#61|title=Much Ado About Nothing: Act 1, Scene 1|work=shakespeare-navigators.com|accessdate=6 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nUpon the soldiers' arrival, Leonato welcomes Don Pedro and invites him to stay for a month, Benedick and Beatrice resume their \"merry war\", and Pedro's illegitimate brother Don John is introduced. Claudio's feelings for Hero, Leonato's only daughter, are rekindled upon seeing her, and Claudio soon announces to Benedick his intention to court her. Benedick, who openly despises marriage, tries to dissuade his friend, but Don Pedro encourages the marriage. Benedick swears that he will never get married. Don Pedro laughs at him and tells him that when he has found the right person he shall get married.\n\nA [[masquerade ball]] is planned in celebration of the end of the war, giving a disguised Don Pedro the opportunity to [[Courtship|woo]] Hero on Claudio's behalf. Don John uses this situation to get revenge on him by telling Claudio that Don Pedro is wooing Hero for himself. A furious Claudio confronts Don Pedro, but the misunderstanding is quickly resolved and Claudio wins Hero's hand in marriage.\n\nMeanwhile, Benedick disguises himself and dances with Beatrice, who proceeds to tell this \"mystery man\" that Benedick is \"the prince's jester, a very dull fool.\" Enraged by her words, Benedick swears he will have revenge. Don Pedro and his men, bored at the prospect of waiting a week for the wedding, concoct a plan to match-make between Benedick and Beatrice. They arrange for the former to overhear a conversation in which they declare that the latter is madly in love with him, but is too afraid to tell him as their pride is the main impediment to their courtship. Meanwhile, Hero and her maid, Ursula, ensure Beatrice overhears them discuss Benedick's undying love for her. The tricks have the desired effect: both Benedick and Beatrice are delighted to think they are the object of [[unrequited love]], and both accordingly resolve to mend their faults and reconcile.\n\nMeanwhile, Don John, the \"bastard prince\", plots to stop the wedding, embarrass his brother, and wreak misery on Leonato and Claudio. He informs Don Pedro and Claudio that Hero is unfaithful, and arranges for them to see his associate, Borachio, enter her bedchamber and engage in an amorous liaison with her (though in reality it was Margaret, Hero's chambermaid). Claudio and Don Pedro are taken in, and the former vows to publicly humiliate Hero.\n\n[[File:Much Ado About Nothing by Alfred Elmore 1846.jpg|thumbnail|left|Swooning of Hero in the Church scene by [[Alfred Elmore]]]]\n\nAt the wedding the next day, Claudio denounces Hero before the stunned guests and storms off with Don Pedro, causing Hero to faint. A humiliated Leonato expresses his wish for her to die. The presiding friar intervenes, believing Hero to be innocent. He suggests the family must fake Hero's death in order to extract the truth and Claudio's remorse. Prompted by the day's stressful events, Benedick and Beatrice confess their love for each other. Beatrice then asks Benedick to kill Claudio as proof of his devotion, since he has slandered her kinswoman. Benedick is disgusted and at first denies her request. Leonato and his brother Antonio blame Claudio for Hero's apparent death and challenge him to a duel. Benedick then does the same, following Beatrice's commands as he is one of the few who believe Hero. Luckily, on the night of Don John's treachery, the local Watch apprehended Borachio and his ally, Conrade. Despite the comic ineptness of the Watch (headed by constable [[Dogberry]], a master of [[malapropism]]s), they have overheard the duo discussing their evil plans. The Watch arrest the villains and eventually obtain a confession, informing Leonato of Hero's innocence. Though Don John has fled the city, a force is sent to capture him. Claudio, stricken with remorse at Hero's supposed death, agrees to her father's demand that he marry Antonio's daughter, \"almost the copy of my child that's dead\"<ref name=\"shakespeare-navigators.com\"/> and carry on the family name.\n\nAt the wedding, the bride is revealed to be a still living Hero. Claudio is overjoyed. Beatrice and Benedick, prompted by their friends' interference, finally and publicly confess their love for each other. As the play draws to a close, a messenger arrives with news of Don John's capture, but Benedick proposes to postpone deciding Don John's punishment until tomorrow so the couples can enjoy their newfound happiness. Don Pedro expresses his loneliness since he hasn't found love, to which Benedick responds, \"Get thee a wife.\"\n\n==Sources==\nStories of lovers deceived into believing each other false were common currency in northern Italy in the sixteenth century. Shakespeare's immediate source could have been one of the ''Novelle'' (\"Tales\") by [[Matteo Bandello]] of [[Mantua]], dealing with the tribulations of Sir Timbreo and his betrothed Fenicia Lionata in Messina after [[Peter III of Aragon|King Piero's]] defeat of [[Charles of Anjou]], perhaps through the translation into French by [[Fran\u00e7ois de Belleforest]].<ref name=\"RasmussenShakespeare2007\">{{cite book|last1=Rasmussen|first1=Eric|authorlink1=|last2=Bate|first2=Jonathan|authorlink2=Jonathan Bate|title=The RSC Shakespeare: the complete works|year=2007|publisher=Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=978-0-230-00350-7|page=257|chapter=Much Ado About Nothing}}</ref> Another version featuring lovers Ariodante and Ginevra, with the servant Dalinda impersonating Ginevra on the balcony, appears in Book V of ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'' by [[Ludovico Ariosto]], published in an English translation in 1591.<ref name=\"Shakespeare1997\">{{cite book|last=Evans|first=G.

W. Norton & Company]], 1997 {{ISBN|0-393-97087-6}}) p.&nbsp;1387</ref> The earliest recorded performances are two that were given at Court in the winter of 1612\u20131613, during the festivities preceding the marriage of Princess [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Elizabeth]] with [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine]] (14 February 1613). The play was published in [[book size|quarto]] in 1600 by the stationers [[Andrew Wise]] and [[William Aspley]]. This was the only edition prior to the [[First Folio]] in 1623.\n\n==Analysis and criticism==\n\n===Style===\nThe play is predominantly written in prose.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shakespeare.mit.edu/much_ado/full.html |title=Much Ado About Nothing: Entire Play |publisher=Shakespeare.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=12 November 2012}}</ref> The substantial verse sections achieve a sense of decorum and provide energy to its audience.<ref name=arden>{{cite book|editor=A. R. Hunphreys| title=Much Ado About Nothing| publisher=Arden Edition| year=1981}}</ref>\n\n===Setting===\n''Much Ado About Nothing'' is set in [[Messina]], a port on the island of [[Sicily]], which is next to the toe of [[Italy]]. Sicily was [[History of Sicily#Spanish period|ruled by Aragon]] at the time the play was set.<ref>{{cite book|last= Bate|first=Jonathan|authorlink=Jonathan Bate|title=Soul of the Age: the Life, Mind and World of William Shakespeare|publisher=Viking|location=London|year=2008|page=305|isbn=978-0-670-91482-1}}</ref> The action of the play takes place mainly at the home and on the grounds of Leonato's Estate.\n\n===Themes and motifs===\n\n====Gender roles====\n[[File:Kill Claudio.jpg|thumb|Drawing of [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] as Benedick and [[Winifred Emery]] as Beatrice in a 1905 production. Act II, Scene v: \"Kill Claudio\".]]\nBenedick and Beatrice quickly became the main interest of the play, to the point where they are today considered the leading roles, even though their relationship is given equal or lesser weight in the script than Claudio and Hero's situation.  [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] even wrote 'Benedick and Beatrice' beside the title of the play in his copy of the [[Second Folio]].<ref>G. Blakemore Evans, ''The Riverside Shakespeare'', Houghton Mifflin, 1974; p.&nbsp;327.</ref> The provocative treatment of gender is central to the play and should be considered in its [[Renaissance]] context. While this was reflected and emphasized in certain plays of the period, it was also challenged.<ref name=\"McEachern\">McEachern, ''Much Ado About Nothing'', Arden; 3rd edition, 2005.</ref> Amussen<ref>Amussen, ''Ordered Society'', Columbia University Press (15 April 1994).</ref> notes that the undoing of traditional gender clich\u00e9s appears to have inflamed anxieties about the erosion of social order. It seems that comic drama could be a means of calming such anxieties. Ironically, we can see through the play's popularity that this only increased people's interest in such behavior. Benedick wittily gives voice to male anxieties about women's \"sharp tongues and proneness to sexual lightness\".<ref name=\"McEachern\" /> In the patriarchal society of the play, the men's loyalties were governed by conventional codes of honour and camaraderie and a sense of superiority to women.<ref name=\"McEachern\" /> Assumptions that women are by nature prone to inconstancy are shown in the repeated jokes on [[cuckold]]ry and partly explain Claudio's readiness to believe the slur against Hero. This stereotype is turned on its head in Balthazar's song \"Sigh No More,\" which presents men as the deceitful and inconstant sex that women must suffer.\n\n====Infidelity====\nA [[Theme (literature)|theme]] in Shakespeare is cuckoldry or the infidelity of a wife. Several of the characters seem to be obsessed by the idea that a man has no way to know if his wife is faithful and therefore women can take full advantage of that fact. Don John plays upon Claudio's pride and fear of cuckoldry, which leads to the disastrous first wedding. Many of the males easily believe that Hero is impure and even her father readily condemns her with very little proof. This [[Motif (narrative)|motif]] runs through the play, often in references to horns, a symbol of cuckoldry.\n\nIn contrast, Balthasar's song \"[[Sigh No More (Much Ado About Nothing)|Sigh No More]]\" tells women to accept men's infidelity and continue to live joyfully. Some interpretations say that Balthasar sings poorly, undercutting the message. This is supported by Benedick's cynical comments about the song, where he compares it to a howling dog. However, in the 1993 Branagh film Balthasar sings beautifully, the song is also given a prominent role in both the opening and finale and the message appears to be embraced by the women in the film.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Deleyto|first1= Celestino|year= 1997|title= Men in Leather: Kenneth Branagh's Much Ado about Nothing and Romantic Comedy|journal= Cinema Journal|volume= 36|issue= 3|pages= 91\u2013105|publisher= University of Texas Press |doi= 10.2307/1225677|jstor= 1225677}}</ref>\n\n====Deception====\nIn ''Much Ado About Nothing'', there are many examples of deception and self-deception. The games and tricks played on people often have the best intentions{{snd}}to make people fall in love, to help someone get what they want, or to lead someone to realize their mistake. However, not all are meant well, such as when Don John convinces Claudio that Don Pedro wants Hero for himself, or when Borachio meets 'Hero' (who is actually Margaret, pretending to be Hero) in Hero's bedroom window. These modes of deceit play into a complementary theme of emotional manipulation and the ease with which the characters' sentiments are redirected and their propensities exploited as a means to an end. The characters' feelings for each other are played as vehicles to reach an ultimate goal of engagement rather than seen as an end in themselves.\n\n====Masks and mistaken identity====\nPeople are constantly pretending to be others or being mistaken for other people. An example of this is Margaret who is mistaken for Hero, which leads to Hero's public disgrace at her wedding with Claudio. However, during a masked ball in which everyone must wear a mask, Beatrice rants about Benedick to a masked man who turns out to be Benedick himself but she acts unaware of this at the time. During the same celebration, Don Pedro, masked, pretends to be Claudio and courts Hero for him. After Hero is announced \"dead,\" Leonato orders Claudio to marry his \"niece,\" who is actually Hero in disguise.\n\n====Noting====\n[[File:Beatrice overhears Hero and Ursula.jpg|thumb|A watercolor by [[John Sutcliffe (artist)|John Sutcliffe]]: Beatrice overhears Hero and Ursula.]]\n\nAnother motif is the play on the words ''nothing'' and ''noting'', which in Shakespeare's day were near-[[homophone]]s.<ref>See Stephen Greenblatt's introduction to ''Much Ado about Nothing'' in ''The Norton Shakespeare'' ([[W. W. Norton & Company]], 1997 {{ISBN|0-393-97087-6}}), p.&nbsp;1383.</ref> Taken literally, the title implies that a great fuss (\"much ado\") is made of something which is insignificant (\"nothing\"), such as the unfounded claims of Hero's infidelity and the unfounded claims that Benedick and Beatrice are in love with each other. The title could also be understood as ''Much Ado About Noting''. Much of the action centers around interest in and critique of others, written messages, [[Espionage|spying]], and [[eavesdropping]]. This attention on others is directly mentioned several times, particularly concerning \"seeming,\" \"fashion,\" and outward impressions.\n\n''Nothing'' is also a [[double entendre]]; \"an O-thing\" (or \"n othing\" or \"no thing\") was Elizabethan slang for \"[[vagina]]\", evidently derived from the pun of a woman having \"nothing\" between her legs.<ref name=\"RasmussenShakespeare2007\" /><ref>See Gordon Williams ''A Glossary of Shakespeare's Sexual Language'' (Althone Press, 1997 {{ISBN|0-485-12130-1}}) at p.&nbsp;219: \"As Shakespeare's title ironically acknowledges, vagina and virginity are a nothing causing Much Ado.\"</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/8313901/Title-Deed-How-the-Book-Got-its-Name.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Gary | last=Dexter | title=Title Deed: How the Book Got its Name | date=13 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nExamples of noting as noticing occur in the following instances: (1.1.131\u2013132)\n{{quote|'''Claudio:''' Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signor Leonato?<br />\n'''Benedick:''' I noted her not, but I looked on her.}}\nand (4.1.154\u2013157).\n{{quote|'''Friar:''' Hear me a little,<br />\nFor I have only been silent so long<br />\nAnd given way unto this course of fortune<br />\nBy noting of the lady.}}\n\nAt (3.3.102\u2013104), Borachio indicates that a man's clothing doesn't indicate his character:\n{{quote|'''Borachio:''' Thou knowest that the fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a cloak is nothing to a man.}}\n\nA triple play on words in which noting signifies noticing, musical notes and nothing occurs at (2.3.47\u201352):\n{{quote|'''Don Pedro:''' Nay pray thee, come;<br />\nOr if thou wilt hold longer argument,<br />\nDo it in notes.<br />\n'''Balthasar:''' Note this before my notes:<br />\nThere's not a note of mine that's worth the noting.<br />\n'''Don Pedro:''' Why, these are very crotchets that he speaks \u2013<br />\nNote notes, forsooth, and nothing!}}\n\nDon Pedro's last line can be understood to mean, \"Pay attention to your music and nothing else!\" The complex layers of meaning include a pun on \"crotchets,\" which can mean both \"[[quarter note]]s\" (in music) and whimsical notions.\n\nThe following are [[pun]]s on notes as messages: (2.1.174\u2013176),\n{{quote|'''Claudio:''' I pray you leave me.<br />\n'''Benedick:''' Ho, now you strike like the blind man \u2013 'twas the boy that stole your meat, and you'll beat the post.}}\nin which Benedick plays on the word ''post'' as a pole and as mail delivery in a joke reminiscent of Shakespeare's earlier advice \"[[Shooting the messenger|Don't shoot the messenger]]\"; and (2.3.138\u2013142)\n\n{{quote|'''Claudio:''' Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember a [[wikt:pretty|pretty]] jest your daughter told us of.<br />\n'''Leonato:''' O, when she had writ it and was reading it over, she found Benedick and Beatrice between the sheet?}}\nin which Leonato makes a sexual innuendo concerning ''sheet'' as a sheet of paper (on which Beatrice's love note to Benedick is to have been written) and a bedsheet.\n\n==Performance history==\n[[File:Garrick as Benedick.jpg|thumb|[[David Garrick]] as Benedick, by {{Interlanguage link multi|Jean-Louis Fesch|fr}}, 1770]]\n\nThe play was very popular in its early decades, and continues to be a standard wherever Shakespeare is performed. In a poem published in 1640, [[Leonard Digges (writer)|Leonard Digges]] wrote, \"[\u2026] let but Beatrice&nbsp;/ And Benedick be seen, lo in a trice&nbsp;/ The [[Cockpit Theatre|Cockpit]] galleries, boxes, all are full.\"\n\n[[File:Gielgud and Leighton in Much Ado 1959.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|[[John Gielgud]] and [[Margaret Leighton]] in the 1959 Broadway production of ''Much Ado About Nothing''.]]\n\nAfter the theatres re-opened during the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]], Sir [[William Davenant]] staged ''The Law Against Lovers'' (1662), which inserted Beatrice and Benedick into an adaptation of ''[[Measure for Measure]]''. Another adaptation, ''The Universal Passion'', combined ''Much Ado'' with a play by [[Moli\u00e8re]] (1737). Shakespeare's text had been revived by [[John Rich (producer)|John Rich]] at [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]] (1721). [[David Garrick]] first played Benedick in 1748 and continued to play him until 1776.<ref>[[F. E. Halliday]], ''A Shakespeare Companion 1564\u20131964.'' Baltimore, Penguin, 1964, pp.&nbsp;326 f.</ref>\n\nThe great nineteenth-century stage team [[Henry Irving]] and [[Ellen Terry]] counted Benedick and Beatrice as their greatest triumph and [[Charles Kemble]] also had a great success as Benedick. [[John Gielgud]] made Benedick one of his signature roles between 1931 and 1959, playing the part opposite the Beatrice of [[Diana Wynyard]], [[Peggy Ashcroft]], and [[Margaret Leighton]]. The longest running Broadway production is [[A. J. Antoon]]'s 1972 staging starring [[Sam Waterston]], [[Kathleen Widdoes]], and [[Barnard Hughes]], and [[Derek Jacobi]] won a [[Tony Award]] for playing Benedick in 1984. Jacobi had also played Benedick in the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]]'s highly praised 1982 production. Director [[Terry Hands]] produced the play on a stage-length mirror, against an unchanging backdrop of painted trees. [[Sin\u00e9ad Cusack]] played Beatrice. In 2013 [[James Earl Jones]] and [[Vanessa Redgrave]] (then already in their seventies and eighties, respectively) played Benedick and Beatrice on stage at [[The Old Vic]], London.\n{{-}}\n\n===

Leonato explains that \"There is a kind of merry war betwixt Signor Benedick and her.\"<ref name=\"shakespeare-navigators.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.shakespeare-navigators.com/ado/AdoText11.html#61|title=Much Ado About Nothing: Act 1, Scene 1|work=shakespeare-navigators.com|accessdate=6 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nUpon the soldiers' arrival, Leonato welcomes Don Pedro and invites him to stay for a month, Benedick and Beatrice resume their \"merry war\", and Pedro's illegitimate brother Don John is introduced. Claudio's feelings for Hero, Leonato's only daughter, are rekindled upon seeing her, and Claudio soon announces to Benedick his intention to court her. Benedick, who openly despises marriage, tries to dissuade his friend, but Don Pedro encourages the marriage. Benedick swears that he will never get married. Don Pedro laughs at him and tells him that when he has found the right person he shall get married.\n\nA [[masquerade ball]] is planned in celebration of the end of the war, giving a disguised Don Pedro the opportunity to [[Courtship|woo]] Hero on Claudio's behalf. Don John uses this situation to get revenge on him by telling Claudio that Don Pedro is wooing Hero for himself. A furious Claudio confronts Don Pedro, but the misunderstanding is quickly resolved and Claudio wins Hero's hand in marriage.\n\nMeanwhile, Benedick disguises himself and dances with Beatrice, who proceeds to tell this \"mystery man\" that Benedick is \"the prince's jester, a very dull fool.\" Enraged by her words, Benedick swears he will have revenge. Don Pedro and his men, bored at the prospect of waiting a week for the wedding, concoct a plan to match-make between Benedick and Beatrice. They arrange for the former to overhear a conversation in which they declare that the latter is madly in love with him, but is too afraid to tell him as their pride is the main impediment to their courtship. Meanwhile, Hero and her maid, Ursula, ensure Beatrice overhears them discuss Benedick's undying love for her. The tricks have the desired effect: both Benedick and Beatrice are delighted to think they are the object of [[unrequited love]], and both accordingly resolve to mend their faults and reconcile.\n\nMeanwhile, Don John, the \"bastard prince\", plots to stop the wedding, embarrass his brother, and wreak misery on Leonato and Claudio. He informs Don Pedro and Claudio that Hero is unfaithful, and arranges for them to see his associate, Borachio, enter her bedchamber and engage in an amorous liaison with her (though in reality it was Margaret, Hero's chambermaid). Claudio and Don Pedro are taken in, and the former vows to publicly humiliate Hero.\n\n[[File:Much Ado About Nothing by Alfred Elmore 1846.jpg|thumbnail|left|Swooning of Hero in the Church scene by [[Alfred Elmore]]]]\n\nAt the wedding the next day, Claudio denounces Hero before the stunned guests and storms off with Don Pedro, causing Hero to faint. A humiliated Leonato expresses his wish for her to die. The presiding friar intervenes, believing Hero to be innocent. He suggests the family must fake Hero's death in order to extract the truth and Claudio's remorse. Prompted by the day's stressful events, Benedick and Beatrice confess their love for each other. Beatrice then asks Benedick to kill Claudio as proof of his devotion, since he has slandered her kinswoman. Benedick is disgusted and at first denies her request. Leonato and his brother Antonio blame Claudio for Hero's apparent death and challenge him to a duel. Benedick then does the same, following Beatrice's commands as he is one of the few who believe Hero. Luckily, on the night of Don John's treachery, the local Watch apprehended Borachio and his ally, Conrade. Despite the comic ineptness of the Watch (headed by constable [[Dogberry]], a master of [[malapropism]]s), they have overheard the duo discussing their evil plans. The Watch arrest the villains and eventually obtain a confession, informing Leonato of Hero's innocence. Though Don John has fled the city, a force is sent to capture him. Claudio, stricken with remorse at Hero's supposed death, agrees to her father's demand that he marry Antonio's daughter, \"almost the copy of my child that's dead\"<ref name=\"shakespeare-navigators.com\"/> and carry on the family name.\n\nAt the wedding, the bride is revealed to be a still living Hero. Claudio is overjoyed. Beatrice and Benedick, prompted by their friends' interference, finally and publicly confess their love for each other. As the play draws to a close, a messenger arrives with news of Don John's capture, but Benedick proposes to postpone deciding Don John's punishment until tomorrow so the couples can enjoy their newfound happiness. Don Pedro expresses his loneliness since he hasn't found love, to which Benedick responds, \"Get thee a wife.\"\n\n==Sources==\nStories of lovers deceived into believing each other false were common currency in northern Italy in the sixteenth century.

W.

The play was published in [[book size|quarto]] in 1600 by the stationers [[Andrew Wise]] and [[William Aspley]]. This was the only edition prior to the [[First Folio]] in 1623.\n\n==Analysis and criticism==\n\n===Style===\nThe play is predominantly written in prose.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shakespeare.mit.edu/much_ado/full.html |title=Much Ado About Nothing: Entire Play |publisher=Shakespeare.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=12 November 2012}}</ref> The substantial verse sections achieve a sense of decorum and provide energy to its audience.<ref name=arden>{{cite book|editor=A. R. Hunphreys| title=Much Ado About Nothing| publisher=Arden Edition| year=1981}}</ref>\n\n===Setting===\n''Much Ado About Nothing'' is set in [[Messina]], a port on the island of [[Sicily]], which is next to the toe of [[Italy]]. Sicily was [[History of Sicily#Spanish period|ruled by Aragon]] at the time the play was set.<ref>{{cite book|last= Bate|first=Jonathan|authorlink=Jonathan Bate|title=Soul of the Age: the Life, Mind and World of William Shakespeare|publisher=Viking|location=London|year=2008|page=305|isbn=978-0-670-91482-1}}</ref> The action of the play takes place mainly at the home and on the grounds of Leonato's Estate.\n\n===Themes and motifs===\n\n====Gender roles====\n[[File:Kill Claudio.jpg|thumb|Drawing of [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] as Benedick and [[Winifred Emery]] as Beatrice in a 1905 production. Act II, Scene v: \"Kill Claudio\".]]\nBenedick and Beatrice quickly became the main interest of the play, to the point where they are today considered the leading roles, even though their relationship is given equal or lesser weight in the script than Claudio and Hero's situation.  [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] even wrote 'Benedick and Beatrice' beside the title of the play in his copy of the [[Second Folio]].<ref>G. Blakemore Evans, ''The Riverside Shakespeare'', Houghton Mifflin, 1974; p.&nbsp;327.</ref> The provocative treatment of gender is central to the play and should be considered in its [[Renaissance]] context. While this was reflected and emphasized in certain plays of the period, it was also challenged.<ref name=\"McEachern\">McEachern, ''Much Ado About Nothing'', Arden; 3rd edition, 2005.</ref> Amussen<ref>Amussen, ''Ordered Society'', Columbia University Press (15 April 1994).</ref> notes that the undoing of traditional gender clich\u00e9s appears to have inflamed anxieties about the erosion of social order. It seems that comic drama could be a means of calming such anxieties. Ironically, we can see through the play's popularity that this only increased people's interest in such behavior. Benedick wittily gives voice to male anxieties about women's \"sharp tongues and proneness to sexual lightness\".<ref name=\"McEachern\" /> In the patriarchal society of the play, the men's loyalties were governed by conventional codes of honour and camaraderie and a sense of superiority to women.<ref name=\"McEachern\" /> Assumptions that women are by nature prone to inconstancy are shown in the repeated jokes on [[cuckold]]ry and partly explain Claudio's readiness to believe the slur against Hero. This stereotype is turned on its head in Balthazar's song \"Sigh No More,\" which presents men as the deceitful and inconstant sex that women must suffer.\n\n====Infidelity====\nA [[Theme (literature)|theme]] in Shakespeare is cuckoldry or the infidelity of a wife. Several of the characters seem to be obsessed by the idea that a man has no way to know if his wife is faithful and therefore women can take full advantage of that fact. Don John plays upon Claudio's pride and fear of cuckoldry, which leads to the disastrous first wedding. Many of the males easily believe that Hero is impure and even her father readily condemns her with very little proof. This [[Motif (narrative)|motif]] runs through the play, often in references to horns, a symbol of cuckoldry.\n\nIn contrast, Balthasar's song \"[[Sigh No More (Much Ado About Nothing)|Sigh No More]]\" tells women to accept men's infidelity and continue to live joyfully. Some interpretations say that Balthasar sings poorly, undercutting the message. This is supported by Benedick's cynical comments about the song, where he compares it to a howling dog.

The games and tricks played on people often have the best intentions{{snd}}to make people fall in love, to help someone get what they want, or to lead someone to realize their mistake. However, not all are meant well, such as when Don John convinces Claudio that Don Pedro wants Hero for himself, or when Borachio meets 'Hero' (who is actually Margaret, pretending to be Hero) in Hero's bedroom window. These modes of deceit play into a complementary theme of emotional manipulation and the ease with which the characters' sentiments are redirected and their propensities exploited as a means to an end. The characters' feelings for each other are played as vehicles to reach an ultimate goal of engagement rather than seen as an end in themselves.\n\n====Masks and mistaken identity====\nPeople are constantly pretending to be others or being mistaken for other people. An example of this is Margaret who is mistaken for Hero, which leads to Hero's public disgrace at her wedding with Claudio. However, during a masked ball in which everyone must wear a mask, Beatrice rants about Benedick to a masked man who turns out to be Benedick himself but she acts unaware of this at the time. During the same celebration, Don Pedro, masked, pretends to be Claudio and courts Hero for him. After Hero is announced \"dead,\" Leonato orders Claudio to marry his \"niece,\" who is actually Hero in disguise.\n\n====Noting====\n[[File:Beatrice overhears Hero and Ursula.jpg|thumb|A watercolor by [[John Sutcliffe (artist)|John Sutcliffe]]: Beatrice overhears Hero and Ursula.]]\n\nAnother motif is the play on the words ''nothing'' and ''noting'', which in Shakespeare's day were near-[[homophone]]s.<ref>See Stephen Greenblatt's introduction to ''Much Ado about Nothing'' in ''The Norton Shakespeare'' ([[W. W. Norton & Company]], 1997 {{ISBN|0-393-97087-6}}), p.&nbsp;1383.</ref> Taken literally, the title implies that a great fuss (\"much ado\") is made of something which is insignificant (\"nothing\"), such as the unfounded claims of Hero's infidelity and the unfounded claims that Benedick and Beatrice are in love with each other. The title could also be understood as ''Much Ado About Noting''. Much of the action centers around interest in and critique of others, written messages, [[Espionage|spying]], and [[eavesdropping]]. This attention on others is directly mentioned several times, particularly concerning \"seeming,\" \"fashion,\" and outward impressions.\n\n''Nothing'' is also a [[double entendre]]; \"an O-thing\" (or \"n othing\" or \"no thing\") was Elizabethan slang for \"[[vagina]]\", evidently derived from the pun of a woman having \"nothing\" between her legs.<ref name=\"RasmussenShakespeare2007\" /><ref>See Gordon Williams ''A Glossary of Shakespeare's Sexual Language'' (Althone Press, 1997 {{ISBN|0-485-12130-1}}) at p.&nbsp;219: \"As Shakespeare's title ironically acknowledges, vagina and virginity are a nothing causing Much Ado.\"</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/8313901/Title-Deed-How-the-Book-Got-its-Name.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Gary | last=Dexter | title=Title Deed: How the Book Got its Name | date=13 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nExamples of noting as noticing occur in the following instances: (1.1.131\u2013132)\n{{quote|'''Claudio:''' Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signor Leonato?<br />\n'''Benedick:''' I noted her not, but I looked on her.}}\nand (4.1.154\u2013157).\n{{quote|'''Friar:''' Hear me a little,<br />\nFor I have only been silent so long<br />\nAnd given way unto this course of fortune<br />\nBy noting of the lady.}}\n\nAt (3.3.102\u2013104), Borachio indicates that a man's clothing doesn't indicate his character:\n{{quote|'''Borachio:''' Thou knowest that the fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a cloak is nothing to a man.}}\n\nA triple play on words in which noting signifies noticing, musical notes and nothing occurs at (2.3.47\u201352):\n{{quote|'''Don Pedro:''' Nay pray thee, come;<br />\nOr if thou wilt hold longer argument,<br />\nDo it in notes.<br />\n'''Balthasar:''' Note this before my notes:<br />\nThere's not a note of mine that's worth the noting.<br />\n'''Don Pedro:''' Why, these are very crotchets that he speaks \u2013<br />\nNote notes, forsooth, and nothing!}}\n\nDon Pedro's last line can be understood to mean, \"Pay attention to your music and nothing else!\" The complex layers of meaning include a pun on \"crotchets,\" which can mean both \"[[quarter note]]s\" (in music) and whimsical notions.\n\nThe following are [[pun]]s on notes as messages: (2.1.174\u2013176),\n{{quote|'''Claudio:''' I pray you leave me.<br />\n'''Benedick:''' Ho, now you strike like the blind man \u2013 'twas the boy that stole your meat, and you'll beat the post.}}\nin which Benedick plays on the word ''post'' as a pole and as mail delivery in a joke reminiscent of Shakespeare's earlier advice \"[[Shooting the messenger|Don't shoot the messenger]]\"; and (2.3.138\u2013142)\n\n{{quote|'''Claudio:''' Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember a [[wikt:pretty|pretty]] jest your daughter told us of.<br />\n'''Leonato:''' O, when she had writ it and was reading it over, she found Benedick and Beatrice between the sheet?}}\nin which Leonato makes a sexual innuendo concerning ''sheet'' as a sheet of paper (on which Beatrice's love note to Benedick is to have been written) and a bedsheet.\n\n==Performance history==\n[[File:Garrick as Benedick.jpg|thumb|[[David Garrick]] as Benedick, by {{Interlanguage link multi|Jean-Louis Fesch|fr}}, 1770]]\n\nThe play was very popular in its early decades, and continues to be a standard wherever Shakespeare is performed. In a poem published in 1640, [[Leonard Digges (writer)|Leonard Digges]] wrote, \"[\u2026] let but Beatrice&nbsp;/ And Benedick be seen, lo in a trice&nbsp;/ The [[Cockpit Theatre|Cockpit]] galleries, boxes, all are full.\"\n\n[[File:Gielgud and Leighton in Much Ado 1959.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|[[John Gielgud]] and [[Margaret Leighton]] in the 1959 Broadway production of ''Much Ado About Nothing''.]]\n\nAfter the theatres re-opened during the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]], Sir [[William Davenant]] staged ''The Law Against Lovers'' (1662), which inserted Beatrice and Benedick into an adaptation of ''[[Measure for Measure]]''. Another adaptation, ''The Universal Passion'', combined ''Much Ado'' with a play by [[Moli\u00e8re]] (1737). Shakespeare's text had been revived by [[John Rich (producer)|John Rich]] at [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]] (1721). [[David Garrick]] first played Benedick in 1748 and continued to play him until 1776.<ref>[[F. E. Halliday]], ''A Shakespeare Companion 1564\u20131964.'' Baltimore, Penguin, 1964, pp.&nbsp;326 f.</ref>\n\nThe great nineteenth-century stage team [[Henry Irving]] and [[Ellen Terry]] counted Benedick and Beatrice as their greatest triumph and [[Charles Kemble]] also had a great success as Benedick. [[John Gielgud]] made Benedick one of his signature roles between 1931 and 1959, playing the part opposite the Beatrice of [[Diana Wynyard]], [[Peggy Ashcroft]], and [[Margaret Leighton]]. The longest running Broadway production is [[A. J. Antoon]]'s 1972 staging starring [[Sam Waterston]], [[Kathleen Widdoes]], and [[Barnard Hughes]], and [[Derek Jacobi]] won a [[Tony Award]] for playing Benedick in 1984. Jacobi had also played Benedick in the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]]'s highly praised 1982 production. Director [[Terry Hands]] produced the play on a stage-length mirror, against an unchanging backdrop of painted trees. [[Sin\u00e9ad Cusack]] played Beatrice. In 2013 [[James Earl Jones]] and [[Vanessa Redgrave]] (then already in their seventies and eighties, respectively) played Benedick and Beatrice on stage at [[The Old Vic]], London.\n{{-}}\n\n===

[[Human physiology]] dictates that a runner's near-top speed cannot be maintained for more than 30\u201335 seconds due to the depletion of [[phosphocreatine]] stores in muscles, and perhaps secondarily to excessive [[metabolic acidosis]] as a result of [[anaerobic glycolysis]].<ref name=\"400M\" />\n\nIn [[athletics (sport)|athletics]] and [[track and field]], '''sprints''' (or '''dashes''') are races over short distances. They are among the oldest running competitions, being recorded at the [[Ancient Olympic Games]]. Three sprints are currently held at the modern [[Summer Olympics]] and outdoor [[IAAF World Championships in Athletics|World Championships]]: the [[100 metres]], [[200 metres]], and [[400 metres]].\n\nAt the professional level, sprinters begin the race by assuming a crouching position in the [[starting blocks]] before driving forward and gradually moving into an upright position as the race progresses and momentum is gained. The set position differs depending on the start. The use of starting blocks allows the sprinter to perform an enhanced [[Isometric exercise#Isometric presses as preparation for explosive power movements|isometric preload]]; this generates muscular pre-tension which is channelled into the subsequent forward drive, making it more powerful. Body alignment is of key importance in producing the optimal amount of force. Ideally the athlete should begin in a 4-point stance and drive forwards, pushing off using both legs for maximum force production.<ref name=\"100 m \u2013 For the Expert\">[http://www.iaaf.org/community/athletics/trackfield/newsid=4666.html 100 m \u2013 For the Expert].

The ability to \"run a good bend\" is key at the distance, as a well conditioned runner will typically be able to run 200&nbsp;m in an average speed higher than their 100&nbsp;m speed. Usain Bolt, however, ran 200&nbsp;m in the world-record time of 19.19&nbsp;sec, an average speed of 10.422&nbsp;m/s, whereas he ran 100&nbsp;m in the world-record time of 9.58&nbsp;sec, an average speed of 10.438&nbsp;m/s.\n*Indoors, the race is run as one lap of the track, with only slightly slower times than outdoors.\n*A slightly shorter race (but run on a straight track), the [[Stadion (ancient sports)|stadion]], was the first recorded event at the [[ancient Olympic Games]] and the oldest known formal sports event in history.\n*The world record in this event is 19.19&nbsp;seconds, held by [[Usain Bolt]] and was set on 20 August 2009, at the [[2009 World Athletics Championships]].\n\n====400 m====\n*The '''[[400 metres]]''' is one lap around the track on the inside lane.

The distance was used in a race between 1996 Olympic champions, the 100&nbsp;m gold medalist [[Donovan Bailey]] (Canada) and 200&nbsp;m gold medalist [[Michael Johnson (athlete)|Michael Johnson]] (USA). It was to decide which of the two was really the 'fastest man on earth' (see [[Bailey\u2013Johnson 150-metre race]]).\n*The informal distance was used for an exhibition race during the Manchester Great CityGames in as part of the 2009 [[Great Manchester Run]] (UK).

Races commence with the firing of the [[Starting pistol|starter's gun]].<ref name=IAAF /> The starting commands are \"On your marks\" and \"Set\".<ref name=IAAF /> Once all athletes are in the set position, the starter's gun is fired, officially starting the race. For the 100&nbsp;m, all competitors are lined up side-by-side. For the 200&nbsp;m, 300&nbsp;m and 400&nbsp;m, which involve curves, runners are staggered for the start.\n\nIn the rare event that there are technical issues with a start, a green card is shown to all the athletes. The green card carries no penalty. If an athlete is unhappy with track conditions after the \"on your marks\" command is given, the athlete must raise a hand before the \"set\" command and provide the Start referee with a reason. It is then up to the Start referee to decide if the reason is valid. In the event that the Start referee deems the reason invalid, a yellow card (warning) is issued to that particular athlete. In the event that the athlete is already on a warning the athlete is disqualified.\n\n===False starts===\n{{mainarticle|False start#Athletics (track and field)}}\n[[File:Skyttis athletics tracks.jpg|thumb|Sprint lanes in [[\u00d6rnsk\u00f6ldsvik]], [[Sweden]] as seen from the 100 m starting point]]\nAccording to the IAAF rules, \"An athlete, after assuming a full and final set position, shall not commence his starting motion until after receiving the report of the gun, or approved starting apparatus. If, in the judgement of the Starter or Recallers, he does so any earlier, it shall be deemed a false start.\"<ref name=\"IAAF\"/>\n\nThe [[100 m]] Olympic Gold and Silver medallist [[Linford Christie]] of Great Britain famously had frequent false starts that were marginally below the legal reaction time of 0.1&nbsp;seconds. Christie and his coach, Ron Roddan, both claimed that the false starts were due to Christie's exceptional reaction times being under the legal time. His frequent false starting eventually led to his disqualification from the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] 100&nbsp;m final in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], US due to a second false start by Christie.  Since January 2010, under IAAF rules, a single false start by an athlete results in disqualification.\nIn 2012, a new development to the false start rule was added. Because certain athletes could be disqualified for twitching in the starting blocks but some athletes could make a twitch without the starter noticing and disqualifying the athlete, it was decided that twitching in the starting block while being in the 'set' position would only carry a maximum penalty of a yellow card or a warning. In order to instantly be disqualified for a false start, an athlete's hands must leave the track or their feet must leave the starting blocks, while the athlete is in their final 'set' position.\n\n===Lanes===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1987-0822-034, Sabine Busch, Cornelia Ulrich.jpg|thumb|upright|The finish of the 1987 East German athletics championships]]\nFor all Olympic sprint events, runners must remain within their pre-assigned lanes, which measure 1.22&nbsp;metres (4&nbsp;feet) wide, from start to finish.<ref>''2009 USATF Competition Rules'', Rule 160(1)</ref> The lanes can be numbered 1 through 8, 9, or rarely 10, starting with the inside lane. Any athlete who runs outside the assigned lane to gain an advantage is subject to disqualification. If the athlete is forced to run outside of his or her lane by another person, and no material advantage is gained, there will be no disqualification. Also, a runner who strays from his or her lane in the straightaway, or crosses the outer line of his or her lane on the bend, and gains no advantage by it, will not be disqualified as long as no other runner is obstructed.\n\n===The finish===\nThe first athlete whose torso reaches the vertical plane of the closest edge of the finish line is the winner. To ensure that the sprinter's torso triggers the timing impulse at the finish line rather than an arm, foot, or other body part, a double Photocell is commonly used. Times are only recorded by an electronic timing system when both of these Photocells are simultaneously blocked.\n[[Photo finish]] systems are also used at some track and field events.\n\n== Sprint training ==\n\nWhile genetics play a large role in one's ability to sprint,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lombardo|first=Michael P.|last2=Deaner|first2=Robert O.|date=2014-06-26|title=You can't teach speed: sprinters falsify the deliberate practice model of expertise|journal=PeerJ|language=en|volume=2|pages=e445|doi=10.7717/peerj.445|issn=2167-8359|pmc=4081292|pmid=25024914}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=ACTN3 and ACE genotypes in elite Jamaican and US sprinters|first1=Robert A.|last1=Scott|first2=Rachael|last2=Irving|first3=Laura|last3=Irwin|first4=Errol|last4=Morrison|first5=Vilma|last5=Charlton|first6=Krista|last6=Austin|first7=Dawn|last7=Tladi|first8=Michael|last8=Deason|first9=Samuel A.|last9=Headley|first10=Fred W.|last10=Kolkhorst|first11=Nan|last11=Yang|first12=Kathryn|last12=North|first13=Yannis P.|last13=Pitsiladis|date=1 January 2010|publisher=|journal=Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise|volume=42|issue=1|pages=107\u2013112|doi=10.1249/MSS.0b013e3181ae2bc0|pmid=20010124}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Genes for elite power and sprint performance: ACTN3 leads the way|first1=Nir|last1=Eynon|first2=Erik D.|last2=Hanson|first3=Alejandro|last3=Lucia|first4=Peter J.|last4=Houweling|first5=Fleur|last5=Garton|first6=Kathryn N.|last6=North|first7=David J.|last7=Bishop|date=1 September 2013|publisher=|journal=Sports Medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)|volume=43|issue=9|pages=803\u2013817|doi=10.1007/s40279-013-0059-4|pmid=23681449}}</ref> athletes must be dedicated to their training to ensure that they can optimize their performances. Sprint training includes various running workouts, targeting acceleration, speed development, speed endurance, special endurance, and tempo endurance. Additionally, athletes perform intense strength training workouts, as well as plyometric or jumping workouts.

The blocks helped her to [[Isometric exercise#Isometric presses as preparation for explosive power movements|isometrically preload]] her muscles when she adopted the 'set' position; this allowed her to drive forwards more powerfully and start faster.]]\n'''Sprinting''' is running over a short distance in a limited period of time.It is used in many [[sport]]s that incorporate running, typically as a way of quickly reaching a target or goal, or avoiding or catching an opponent. [[Human physiology]] dictates that a runner's near-top speed cannot be maintained for more than 30\u201335 seconds due to the depletion of [[phosphocreatine]] stores in muscles, and perhaps secondarily to excessive [[metabolic acidosis]] as a result of [[anaerobic glycolysis]].<ref name=\"400M\" />\n\nIn [[athletics (sport)|athletics]] and [[track and field]], '''sprints''' (or '''dashes''') are races over short distances. They are among the oldest running competitions, being recorded at the [[Ancient Olympic Games]]. Three sprints are currently held at the modern [[Summer Olympics]] and outdoor [[IAAF World Championships in Athletics|World Championships]]: the [[100 metres]], [[200 metres]], and [[400 metres]].\n\nAt the professional level, sprinters begin the race by assuming a crouching position in the [[starting blocks]] before driving forward and gradually moving into an upright position as the race progresses and momentum is gained. The set position differs depending on the start. The use of starting blocks allows the sprinter to perform an enhanced [[Isometric exercise#Isometric presses as preparation for explosive power movements|isometric preload]]; this generates muscular pre-tension which is channelled into the subsequent forward drive, making it more powerful. Body alignment is of key importance in producing the optimal amount of force. Ideally the athlete should begin in a 4-point stance and drive forwards, pushing off using both legs for maximum force production.<ref name=\"100 m \u2013 For the Expert\">[http://www.iaaf.org/community/athletics/trackfield/newsid=4666.html 100 m \u2013 For the Expert].

It is popular for training and testing in other sports (e.g., speed testing for [[American football]], although [[40-yard dash|40 yards]] is more common there).\n* The world record in this event is held by American sprinter [[Christian Coleman]] with a time of 6.34&nbsp;seconds.\n* 60-metres is used as an outdoor distance by younger athletes when starting sprint racing.\nNote: Indoor distances are less standardized as many facilities run shorter or occasionally longer distances depending on available space.  60m is the championship distance.\n\n====100 m====\n[[File:Nesta Carter Tyson Gay 2010 Memorial Van Damme.jpg|thumb|[[Tyson Gay]] completes a 100m race]]\n*The [[100 metres]] sprint takes place on one length of the home straight of a standard outdoor 400&nbsp;m track. Often, the world-record holder in this race is considered \"the world's fastest man/woman.\" The current [[Men's 100 metres world record progression|world record]] of 9.58&nbsp;seconds is held by [[Usain Bolt]] of [[Jamaica]] and was set on 16 August 2009, at the [[2009 World Athletics Championships]]. The [[Women's 100 metres world record progression|women's world record]] is 10.49&nbsp;seconds and was set by [[Florence Griffith-Joyner]].\n*World class male sprinters (sub 10.10s) need 41 to 50 strides to cover the whole [[100 metres]] distances.<ref>Jad Adrian (6 March 2011).

The ability to \"run a good bend\" is key at the distance, as a well conditioned runner will typically be able to run 200&nbsp;m in an average speed higher than their 100&nbsp;m speed. Usain Bolt, however, ran 200&nbsp;m in the world-record time of 19.19&nbsp;sec, an average speed of 10.422&nbsp;m/s, whereas he ran 100&nbsp;m in the world-record time of 9.58&nbsp;sec, an average speed of 10.438&nbsp;m/s.\n*Indoors, the race is run as one lap of the track, with only slightly slower times than outdoors.\n*A slightly shorter race (but run on a straight track), the [[Stadion (ancient sports)|stadion]], was the first recorded event at the [[ancient Olympic Games]] and the oldest known formal sports event in history.\n*The world record in this event is 19.19&nbsp;seconds, held by [[Usain Bolt]] and was set on 20 August 2009, at the [[2009 World Athletics Championships]].\n\n====400 m====\n*The '''[[400 metres]]''' is one lap around the track on the inside lane. Runners are staggered in their starting positions to ensure that everyone runs the same distance. While this event is classified as a sprint, there is more scope to use tactics in the race; the fact that 400&nbsp;m times are considerably more than four times a typical 100&nbsp;m time demonstrates this.\n*The world record is currently held by [[Wayde van Niekerk]] with a time of 43.03&nbsp;seconds in Rio Olympic 2016 in 400m final<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iaaf.org/records/by-category/world-records|title=IAAF: World Records {{!}} iaaf.org|website=iaaf.org|access-date=2016-08-15}}</ref>\n\n====Relay====\n[[File:AllysonFelixRelay4x400London2012.jpg|thumb|[[Allyson Felix]], at London 2012 Summer Olympics]]\n*The [[4\u00d7100 metres relay]] is another prestigious event, with an average speed that is quicker than the 100&nbsp;m, as the runners can start moving before they receive the baton. The world record in this event is 36.84&nbsp;seconds, held by the [[Jamaica]]n team as set 11 August 2012 at the [[Games of the XXX Olympiad]] held in London.\n*The [[4x400 metres relay]] is often held at track and field meetings, and is by tradition the final event at major championships.\n\n===Historical and uncommon distances===\n\n====50 yards (45.72 m)====\n*  The event was a common event for most American students, because it was one of the standardized test events as part of the [[President's Council on Fitness, Sports, and Nutrition#Awards|President's Award on Physical Fitness]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hhs.gov/fitness/index.html|title=President's Council on Sports, Fitness & Nutrition (PCSFN)|date=10 January 2017|website=HHS.gov}}</ref>\n\n====50 m====\nThe [[50 metres]] is an uncommon event and alternative to the [[60 metres]]. [[Donovan Bailey]] holds the men's world record with a time of 5.56 seconds and [[Irina Privalova]] holds the women's world record with a time of 5.96 seconds.\n\n====60 yards (54.864 m)====\n{{main|60-yard dash}}\n*  A rarely run sprinting event that was once more commonplace. The world record time of 5.99 is held by [[Lee McRae]], and was set in 1987. The time is often used for [[American Football]] speed training.\n\n====55 m====\nThe [[55 metres]] is an uncommon event that resulted from the metrication of the [[60-yard dash|60 yards]], and is an alternative to the [[60 metres]].\n\n====70 Yards====\n* An extremely rare sprinting event, that was occasionally run in the 1960s. The world record of 6.90 is held by [[Bob Hayes]]\n\n====100 yards (91.44 m)====\n* The outdoor standard in the English (imperial measured) speaking world.  It was part of the [[British Empire and Commonwealth Games|Commonwealth Games]] up until [[Athletics at the 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games|1966]] and was the premier event in American high school sprinting until the [[National Federation of State High School Associations|NFHS]] changed to metric in 1980, now only a secondary distance to the 100 metres.\n* The unofficial World Record Holder is Jamaican [[Asafa Powell]] with a time of 9.07 seconds.\n\n====150 m====\n[[File:Manchester City Games 2009 - Men's final 2 (crop2).jpg|thumb|right|150 metres final at the Manchester City Games 2009]]\n*The informal distance of [[150 metres]] (164.042 yards) can be used to work on a 100&nbsp;m runner's stamina, or a 200&nbsp;m runner's speed, and has been used as an exhibition distance. The distance was used in a race between 1996 Olympic champions, the 100&nbsp;m gold medalist [[Donovan Bailey]] (Canada) and 200&nbsp;m gold medalist [[Michael Johnson (athlete)|Michael Johnson]] (USA). It was to decide which of the two was really the 'fastest man on earth' (see [[Bailey\u2013Johnson 150-metre race]]).\n*The informal distance was used for an exhibition race during the Manchester Great CityGames in as part of the 2009 [[Great Manchester Run]] (UK). Stars included Triple Olympic Champion [[Usain Bolt]] (Jamaica) alongside [[Ivory Williams]] (USA), [[Simeon Williamson]] (UK) and other international track stars. The female race included 400&nbsp;m Olympic Champion, Christine Ohuruogu of Great Britain alongside [[Debbie Ferguson-McKenzie]] ([[Bahamas]]). Bolt ran the distance in a record time of 14.35&nbsp;seconds.<ref>[http://www.iaaf.org/LRR09/news/newsid=50606.html Bolt runs 14.35 sec for 150m; covers 50m-150m in 8.70 sec!]. [[IAAF]] (2009-05-17).

However, stadiums could vary in size and there was apparently no definite standard length for them e.g. the stadium at Delphi measures 177 m and the one at Pergamon 210 m.<ref>Spivey, Nigel, ''The Ancient Olympics'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004, p. 111\u2013112</ref>\n\n====300 m====\n*The [[300 metres]] is another informal distance, which could be used to aid a 200m runner's stamina, or a 400m runner's speed.

Junior girls in several countries run this distance instead of the 400 metres.\n\n====Diaulos====\nThe [[Diaulos (running race)|diaulos]] was an event contested in the Ancient Greek Olympia that was double the length of a [[Stadion (unit)|stadion]].\n\n==Rules==\n\n===The start===\n[[File:Start Jeremy Wariner 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Jeremy Wariner]] beginning a race from the starting blocks]]\n[[Starting blocks]] are used for all competition sprint (up to and including 400&nbsp;m) and relay events (first leg only, up to 4x400&nbsp;m).<ref name=IAAF>[http://www.iaaf.org/download/download?filename=7c4c7e46-8979-453d-a355-a736fdac2281.pdf&urlslug=Competition%20Rules%202012-13 Competition Rules 2012-13], IAAF</ref> The starting blocks consist of two adjustable footplates attached to a rigid frame. Races commence with the firing of the [[Starting pistol|starter's gun]].<ref name=IAAF /> The starting commands are \"On your marks\" and \"Set\".<ref name=IAAF /> Once all athletes are in the set position, the starter's gun is fired, officially starting the race. For the 100&nbsp;m, all competitors are lined up side-by-side. For the 200&nbsp;m, 300&nbsp;m and 400&nbsp;m, which involve curves, runners are staggered for the start.\n\nIn the rare event that there are technical issues with a start, a green card is shown to all the athletes. The green card carries no penalty. If an athlete is unhappy with track conditions after the \"on your marks\" command is given, the athlete must raise a hand before the \"set\" command and provide the Start referee with a reason. It is then up to the Start referee to decide if the reason is valid. In the event that the Start referee deems the reason invalid, a yellow card (warning) is issued to that particular athlete. In the event that the athlete is already on a warning the athlete is disqualified.\n\n===False starts===\n{{mainarticle|False start#Athletics (track and field)}}\n[[File:Skyttis athletics tracks.jpg|thumb|Sprint lanes in [[\u00d6rnsk\u00f6ldsvik]], [[Sweden]] as seen from the 100 m starting point]]\nAccording to the IAAF rules, \"An athlete, after assuming a full and final set position, shall not commence his starting motion until after receiving the report of the gun, or approved starting apparatus. If, in the judgement of the Starter or Recallers, he does so any earlier, it shall be deemed a false start.\"<ref name=\"IAAF\"/>\n\nThe [[100 m]] Olympic Gold and Silver medallist [[Linford Christie]] of Great Britain famously had frequent false starts that were marginally below the legal reaction time of 0.1&nbsp;seconds. Christie and his coach, Ron Roddan, both claimed that the false starts were due to Christie's exceptional reaction times being under the legal time. His frequent false starting eventually led to his disqualification from the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] 100&nbsp;m final in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], US due to a second false start by Christie.  Since January 2010, under IAAF rules, a single false start by an athlete results in disqualification.\nIn 2012, a new development to the false start rule was added. Because certain athletes could be disqualified for twitching in the starting blocks but some athletes could make a twitch without the starter noticing and disqualifying the athlete, it was decided that twitching in the starting block while being in the 'set' position would only carry a maximum penalty of a yellow card or a warning. In order to instantly be disqualified for a false start, an athlete's hands must leave the track or their feet must leave the starting blocks, while the athlete is in their final 'set' position.\n\n===Lanes===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1987-0822-034, Sabine Busch, Cornelia Ulrich.jpg|thumb|upright|The finish of the 1987 East German athletics championships]]\nFor all Olympic sprint events, runners must remain within their pre-assigned lanes, which measure 1.22&nbsp;metres (4&nbsp;feet) wide, from start to finish.<ref>''2009 USATF Competition Rules'', Rule 160(1)</ref> The lanes can be numbered 1 through 8, 9, or rarely 10, starting with the inside lane. Any athlete who runs outside the assigned lane to gain an advantage is subject to disqualification. If the athlete is forced to run outside of his or her lane by another person, and no material advantage is gained, there will be no disqualification. Also, a runner who strays from his or her lane in the straightaway, or crosses the outer line of his or her lane on the bend, and gains no advantage by it, will not be disqualified as long as no other runner is obstructed.\n\n===The finish===\nThe first athlete whose torso reaches the vertical plane of the closest edge of the finish line is the winner. To ensure that the sprinter's torso triggers the timing impulse at the finish line rather than an arm, foot, or other body part, a double Photocell is commonly used. Times are only recorded by an electronic timing system when both of these Photocells are simultaneously blocked.\n[[Photo finish]] systems are also used at some track and field events.\n\n== Sprint training ==\n\nWhile genetics play a large role in one's ability to sprint,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lombardo|first=Michael P.|last2=Deaner|first2=Robert O.|date=2014-06-26|title=You can't teach speed: sprinters falsify the deliberate practice model of expertise|journal=PeerJ|language=en|volume=2|pages=e445|doi=10.7717/peerj.445|issn=2167-8359|pmc=4081292|pmid=25024914}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=ACTN3 and ACE genotypes in elite Jamaican and US sprinters|first1=Robert A.|last1=Scott|first2=Rachael|last2=Irving|first3=Laura|last3=Irwin|first4=Errol|last4=Morrison|first5=Vilma|last5=Charlton|first6=Krista|last6=Austin|first7=Dawn|last7=Tladi|first8=Michael|last8=Deason|first9=Samuel A.|last9=Headley|first10=Fred W.|last10=Kolkhorst|first11=Nan|last11=Yang|first12=Kathryn|last12=North|first13=Yannis P.|last13=Pitsiladis|date=1 January 2010|publisher=|journal=Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise|volume=42|issue=1|pages=107\u2013112|doi=10.1249/MSS.0b013e3181ae2bc0|pmid=20010124}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Genes for elite power and sprint performance: ACTN3 leads the way|first1=Nir|last1=Eynon|first2=Erik D.|last2=Hanson|first3=Alejandro|last3=Lucia|first4=Peter J.|last4=Houweling|first5=Fleur|last5=Garton|first6=Kathryn N.|last6=North|first7=David J.|last7=Bishop|date=1 September 2013|publisher=|journal=Sports Medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)|volume=43|issue=9|pages=803\u2013817|doi=10.1007/s40279-013-0059-4|pmid=23681449}}</ref> athletes must be dedicated to their training to ensure that they can optimize their performances. Sprint training includes various running workouts, targeting acceleration, speed development, speed endurance, special endurance, and tempo endurance. Additionally, athletes perform intense strength training workouts, as well as plyometric or jumping workouts. Collectively, these training methods produce qualities which allow athletes to be stronger, more powerful, in hopes of ultimately running faster.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Sprint cycling]]\n* [[Athletics at the Summer Olympics]]\n** [[60 metres at the Olympics]]\n** [[100 metres at the Olympics]]\n** [[200 metres at the Olympics]]\n** [[400 metres at the Olympics]]\n** [[Sprint hurdles at the Olympics]]\n** [[400 metres hurdles at the Olympics]]\n** [[4\u00d7100 metres relay at the Olympics]]\n** [[4\u00d7400 metres relay at the Olympics]]\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20061117141347/http://www.sprintic.com/extras/greatest_sprint_races/ Top 10 greatest sprint races in history]\n*[https://iaaf.gekko.de/?a=sprints IAAF list of sprint records in XML]\n\n{{Running}}\n{{Athletics events}}\n{{Physical exercise}}\n{{Racing}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{Portal bar|Athletics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sprint (Race)}}\n[[Category:Sprint (running)|*]]\n[[Category:Athletics by type]]\n[[Category:Running by type]]\n", "name_user": "82.39.92.123", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)"}
