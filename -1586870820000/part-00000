The club was founded in 1973 with the purpose of building a successful football team that would be remembered for generations to come. They played their first season in 1974, winning the FAS Division Three League which earns a spot in [[Singapore National Football League|National Football League Division One]] the following year. They enjoyed their greatest successes in 1980s and 90s, winning six consecutive [[FAS Premier League]] titles.\n\nGeylang International has won the league championship twice, since the inception of a professional league in 1996. They have won the [[Singapore FA Cup|1997 Singapore FA Cup]] final and [[2009 Singapore Cup|Singapore Cup]] once. Their greatest season was 1996, when they became the first team to win the league championship and FA Cup. They also reached the [[Singapore FA Cup|1997 Singapore FA Cup]] final, [[Singapore Cup|2001 and 2003 Singapore Cup]] final, and the [[2012 Singapore League Cup]] final as runners-up.\n\nGeylang International has a tradition rivalry with closest neighbour [[Tampines Rovers FC|Tampines Rovers]]. Matches between these two are referred to as the \"Eastern derby\".\n\n==History==\n\n===1973&nbsp;\u2013 1995===\n\nFormally founded by [[Colin Ng]] in 1973 during a dinner gathering with [[Arshad Khamis]], [[Gulam Mohamed]] and [[Omar Ashiblie]], Ng planned to build one of the successful club in Singapore. They were soon known as International Contract Specialists (ICS) FC and played its first friendly match against [[Rollel FC]], a Singapore Business Houses Football League (SBHFL) Division One league club on 15 November 1973 with a 2\u20130 win.<ref>{{cite news|title=League tournaments to be resumed|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article.aspx?articleid=straitstimes19731010-1.2.111.1|newspaper=The Straits Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Surprise win by ICS|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article.aspx?articleid=straitstimes19731116-1.2.114.2|newspaper=The Straits Times}}</ref>\nThey made their season debut in 1974, walking away with 2 titles \u2013 FAS Division Three League & President's Cup with no losses. This was not too difficult for them as they had several star players and well-known footballers among their ranks. With the likes of [[Arshad Khamis]], [[Dollah Kassim]], [[Gulam Mohamed]], [[Samad Allapitchay]], [[Kamal Mohd Nor]] and [[Robert Sim]], they had a formidable side that receives the respect from oppositions. The team coached by The Yap Brothers, Sebastian and Andrew were no stranger to [[Football Association of Singapore]]. For the new season, in line with the [[Football Association of Singapore]] plans to streamline footballs and have teams on geographical consideration for the Division One League, ICS changed its name to Geylang International as their home ground was based at Geylang Field, Lorong 12. In 1975, they entered the [[Singapore National Football League|National Football League Division One]] and won it before adding another title in 1976. Their back to back victory was made sweeter by winning the 1976 President's Cup. {{fact|date=October 2018}}\n\nA relegation in 1981 prompted the arrival of a new management committee that guided the club back to the top division in 1983. In 1984, club president Kasim Chik financed the club and businessman Patrick Ang, who joined in 1986, managed to secure sponsors for them. Despite being relegated that year, they returned to Division 1 of the NFL the following season and the golden era began. In 1988, the FAS started a semi-professional league competition called the [[FAS Premier League]] as the top tier of the Singapore football league structure. they dominated all eight years of the league, winning six consecutive titles from 1988 to 1993 before finishing third in 1994 and second in 1995. Every game would see their home ground packed to the brim as fans clamoured to catch a game of the Eagles\u2019 skilful players. Subsequently, due to the huge fan following which numbered in the thousands, all their games had to be played either in [[Jalan Besar Stadium]] or [[National Stadium]]. The success behind winning the [[FAS Premier League]] was also aided by the players they had. Notably players such as Malik Awab, Razali Saad, Dollah Kassim, Samad Allapitchay and Robert Sim all contributed to the success of the team. These were players who would also go on to represent the country. It might not be known widely by many but they even managed to attract one of the biggest European stars of that era to turn up in their club's colours.  French forward and legend, [[Michel Platini]] visited Singapore to attend a football clinic conducted by them and played half a game for the Eagles to highlight the club's attraction.{{fact|date=October 2018}}\n\n===1996&nbsp;\u2013 2011===\n\nAs Geylang United Football Club, they were one of the eight teams in the inaugural season of the [[S.League]] in [[1996 S.League|1996]].

As the team was full of international stars such as [[Fandi Ahmad]], [[Kadir Yahaya]], [[David Lee (Singaporean footballer)|David Lee]], [[Hamid Reza Estili]], [[Mohammad Khakpour]], and Chris Riley, [[Vincent Subramaniam]] (Head Coach for SAFFC) identified them as the Manchester United of Singapore. As league champions, they qualified for the [[1997\u201398 Asian Club Championship]] but were eliminated after losing 8\u20132 on aggregate by [[Kashima Antlers]] in the first round.{{fact|date=August 2018}}\n\nThe 1997 season was a disappointing season for them. They failed to defend the S.League title, finishing fifth. The Eagles also failed to defend the FA Cup, after losing to [[SAFFC]] in the finals. They did not win any silverware till [[2001 S.League|2001]], when they won their second league title by a close margin. Both forwards, [[Aleksandar \u0110uri\u0107]] and [[Brian Bothwell]] scored 57 goals for the team. It was the best performing S.League season for the team; scoring 84 goals and conceding 28 goals. Just days after winning the league title, they suffered their worst defeat in history; losing 8\u20130 to [[Home United]] in the [[Singapore Cup]] finals. As league champions, they were guaranteed a slot in the qualifying round of the [[2002\u201303 AFC Champions League]] but were eliminated after losing to [[Shanghai Shenhua]] 5\u20131 on aggregate in the second round.{{fact|date=August 2018}}\n\nThe 2002 season saw Geylang United finish third in both the S.League and Singapore Cup. They came close to winning their third [[S.League]] title and first [[Singapore Cup]] in 2003, only to finish runners-up to [[Home United]] for both competitions. As runners-up, they qualified to play in the [[AFC Cup]] 2004 due to [[Home United]]'s double. Their debut in the [[AFC Cup 2004]] was an impressive one. Despite losing their opening match, they managed to stay unbeaten for their next five games in the group stage.

Usually decked in black and green, they come with loud drums and a strong set of lungs, roaring on the team and setting a matchday scene unlike anything most of Singapore have ever seen. The passionate supporters have also formed a close bond with the team. This is especially evident when the Ultras and The Eagles players and coaching staff  heartily participate in a post match song together, after every game, whether the team wins, loses, or draws. <ref>https://www.goal.com/en-sg/news/geylang-internationals-12th-man-the-geylang-ultras/1arnwebg4avzv12j3o8znota7y</ref>\n\n==Players==\n\n{{updated|27 February 2020}}\n\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no=1|nat=SIN|name=[[Hairul Syirhan]]|pos=GK}}\n{{Fs player|no=2|nat=Singapore|name=[[Shahrin Saberin]]|pos=DF|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=4|nat=SIN|name=[[Nurullah Hussein]]|pos=DF|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=5|nat=SIN|name=[[Darren Teh]]|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no=6|nat=SIN|name=[[Nur Luqman]]|pos=MF|other=}}<sup>'''U23'''</sup>\n{{Fs player|no=7|nat=SIN|name=[[Amy Recha]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=8|nat=NED|name=[[Barry Maguire]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=9|nat=SIN|name=[[Khairul Nizam]]|pos=FW}}\n{{Fs player|no=10|nat=SIN|name=[[Fareez Farhan]]|pos=FW}}\n{{Fs player|no=11|nat=SIN|name=[[Harith Kanadi]]|pos=MF}}<sup>'''U23'''</sup>\n{{Fs player|no=13|nat=SIN|name=[[Joshua Pereira]]|pos=MF|other=}}<sup>'''U23'''</sup>\n{{Fs player|no=14|nat=SIN|name=[[Iqbal Hussain]]|pos=FW|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=15|nat=KGZ|name=[[Kamolidin Tashiev]]|pos=DF}}<sup>'''U21'''</sup>\n{{Fs player|no=16|nat=SIN|name=[[Umar Akhbar]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs mid}}\n{{Fs player|no=17|nat=SIN|name=[[Firdaus Kasman]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=18|nat=SIN|name=[[Azri Suhaili]]|pos=MF}}<sup>'''U23'''</sup>\n{{Fs player|no=19|nat=SIN|name=[[Noor Ariff]]|pos=MF}}<sup>'''U23'''</sup>\n{{Fs player|no=21|nat=JPN|name=[[Yuki Ichikawa]]|pos=DF|other=[[Captain (association football)|Captain]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=22|nat=SIN|name=[[Christopher van Huizen]]|pos=MF|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=24|nat=GRE|name=[[Panagiotis Linardos]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=25|nat=SIN|name=[[Zainol Gulam]]|pos=GK}}\n{{Fs player|no=37  |nat=SIN|name=[[Zikos Chua]]|pos=FW}}\n<sup>'''U23'''</sup>\n{{Fs player|no=49|nat=SIN|name=[[Furqan Raoff]]|pos=MF}}<sup>'''U19'''</sup>\n{{Fs player|no=50|nat=SIN|name=[[Wayne Chew]]|pos=GK}}<sup>'''U19'''</sup>\n{{Fs player|no=55|nat=SIN|name=[[Danish Qayyum]]|pos=DF}}<sup>'''U19'''</sup>\n{{Fs player|no=68|nat=SIN|name=[[Ilhan Noor]]|pos=MF}}<sup>'''U19'''</sup>\n{{Fs player|no=70|nat=SIN|name=[[Danish Haziq]]|pos=FW}}<sup>'''U19'''</sup>\n<sup>'''U23'''</sup>\n{{Fs end}}\n<!--\n{{Fs player|no=1|nat=SIN|name=[[Jasper Chan]]|pos=GK}}\n{{Fs player|no=4|nat=SIN|name=[[Zulfadli Zainal Abidin]]|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no=7|nat=SIN|name=[[Ryan Syaffiq]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=8|nat=SIN|name=[[Azhar Sairudin]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=9|nat=SIN|name=[[Faud Ramli]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=10|nat=JPN|name=[[Fumiya Kogure]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=12|nat=SIN|name=[[Sadiq Rahim]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=13|nat=SIN|name=[[Ryson Yap]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=17|nat=SIN|name=[[Cameron Ayrton Bell]]|pos=FW}}\n{{Fs player|no=20|nat=SIN|name=[[Nor Azli Yusoff]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=22|nat=SIN|name=[[Taufiq Ghani]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=1|nat=SIN|name=[[Nur Amin Malik]]|pos=GK}}\n{{Fs player|no=4|nat=SIN|name=[[Isa Halim]]|pos=MF|other=[[captain (association football)|captain]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=8|nat=ARG|name=[[Ricardo Sendra]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=12|nat=SIN|name=[[Russell Santa Maria]]|pos=GK}}\n{{Fs player|no=13|nat=SIN|name=[[Indra Sahdan Daud]]|pos=FW}}\n{{Fs player|no=14|nat=SIN|name=[[Stanley Ng Yong Woo|Stanley Ng]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=16|nat=CRC|name=[[V\u00edctor Coto Ortega|V\u00edctor Coto]]|pos=FW}}\n{{Fs player|no=18|nat=SIN|name=[[Al-Qaasimy Rahman]]|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no=19|nat=SIN|name=[[Farish Khan]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=25|nat=SIN|name=[[Brandon Koh]]|pos=MF}}\n-->\n<!--\n===Players on loan===\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|nat=SIN|name=[[Anders Aplin]]|pos=DF|other=to [[Matsumoto Yamaga FC|Matsumoto Yamaga]]}}\n{{Fs end}}\n-->\n===Club Captains===\n\n{|\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Former Singapore national captain [[Indra Sahdan]] and [[Carlos Delgado]] were affected. It is believed that the club docked Indra's salary as it is displeased that he missed many training sessions while Delgado had some disagreement with the management over money. Club chairman, Ben Teng revealed that as many as 12 players signed two-year full-time contracts at the beginning of this season. The management committee made most of the decisions regarding the handing out of contracts last season, before Teng came on board to replace [[Leong Kok Fann]]. Teng added that he has spoken to all the players and will intend to honour their contracts. In addition, some players, who supplemented their income by driving for Uber, have been ordered to stop such off-field activity. Teng revealed his concern and decided to impose a ban on such activities. The players have signed declarations that they do not have other employment outside of football. As professional, players should be focused on raising our playing standards and should not be distracted by off-field activities.<ref>https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/football/cloud-over-eagles-amid-lean-times</ref>\n\n===2018 Foreign Players Recruitment===\n\nOn 13 February 2018, Geylang International attempted to recruit foreign players online.

The club was founded in 1973 with the purpose of building a successful football team that would be remembered for generations to come. They played their first season in 1974, winning the FAS Division Three League which earns a spot in [[Singapore National Football League|National Football League Division One]] the following year. They enjoyed their greatest successes in 1980s and 90s, winning six consecutive [[FAS Premier League]] titles.\n\nGeylang International has won the league championship twice, since the inception of a professional league in 1996. They have won the [[Singapore FA Cup|1997 Singapore FA Cup]] final and [[2009 Singapore Cup|Singapore Cup]] once. Their greatest season was 1996, when they became the first team to win the league championship and FA Cup. They also reached the [[Singapore FA Cup|1997 Singapore FA Cup]] final, [[Singapore Cup|2001 and 2003 Singapore Cup]] final, and the [[2012 Singapore League Cup]] final as runners-up.\n\nGeylang International has a tradition rivalry with closest neighbour [[Tampines Rovers FC|Tampines Rovers]]. Matches between these two are referred to as the \"Eastern derby\".\n\n==History==\n\n===1973&nbsp;\u2013 1995===\n\nFormally founded by [[Colin Ng]] in 1973 during a dinner gathering with [[Arshad Khamis]], [[Gulam Mohamed]] and [[Omar Ashiblie]], Ng plans to build one of the successful club in Singapore. They were soon known as International Contract Specialists (ICS) FC and played its first friendly match against [[Rollel FC]], a Singapore Business Houses Football League (SBHFL) Division One league club on 15 November 1973 with a 2\u20130 win.<ref>{{cite news|title=League tournaments to be resumed|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article.aspx?articleid=straitstimes19731010-1.2.111.1|newspaper=The Straits Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Surprise win by ICS|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article.aspx?articleid=straitstimes19731116-1.2.114.2|newspaper=The Straits Times}}</ref>\nThey made their season debut in 1974, walking away with 2 titles \u2013 FAS Division Three League & President's Cup with no losses. This was not too difficult for them as they had several star players and well-known footballers among their ranks. With the likes of [[Arshad Khamis]], [[Dollah Kassim]], [[Gulam Mohamed]], [[Samad Allapitchay]], [[Kamal Mohd Nor]] and [[Robert Sim]], they had a formidable side that receives the respect from oppositions. The team coached by The Yap Brothers, Sebastian and Andrew were no stranger to [[Football Association of Singapore]]. For the new season, in line with the [[Football Association of Singapore]] plans to streamline footballs and have teams on geographical consideration for the Division One League, ICS changed its name to Geylang International as their home ground was based at Geylang Field, Lorong 12. In 1975, they entered the [[Singapore National Football League|National Football League Division One]] and won it before adding another title in 1976. Their back to back victory was made sweeter by winning the 1976 President's Cup. {{fact|date=October 2018}}\n\nA relegation in 1981 prompted the arrival of a new management committee that guided the club back to the top division in 1983. In 1984, club president Kasim Chik financed the club and businessman Patrick Ang, who joined in 1986, managed to secure sponsors for them. Despite being relegated that year, they returned to Division 1 of the NFL the following season and the golden era began. In 1988, the FAS started a semi-professional league competition called the [[FAS Premier League]] as the top tier of the Singapore football league structure. they dominated all eight years of the league, winning six consecutive titles from 1988 to 1993 before finishing third in 1994 and second in 1995. Every game would see their home ground packed to the brim as fans clamoured to catch a game of the Eagles\u2019 skilful players. Subsequently, due to the huge fan following which numbered in the thousands, all their games had to be played either in [[Jalan Besar Stadium]] or [[National Stadium]]. The success behind winning the [[FAS Premier League]] was also aided by the players they had. Notably players such as Malik Awab, Razali Saad, Dollah Kassim, Samad Allapitchay and Robert Sim all contributed to the success of the team. These were players who would also go on to represent the country. It might not be known widely by many but they even managed to attract one of the biggest European stars of that era to turn up in their club's colours.  French forward and legend, [[Michel Platini]] visited Singapore to attend a football clinic conducted by them and played half a game for the Eagles to highlight the club's attraction.{{fact|date=October 2018}}\n\n===1996&nbsp;\u2013 2011===\n\nAs Geylang United Football Club, they were one of the eight teams in the inaugural season of the [[S.League]] in [[1996 S.League|1996]]. They won the first stage (the Tiger Beer Series) of the league season and finished fifth in the second stage (the Pioneer Series). They won the league after defeating [[SAFFC]] (the Pioneer Series champions) 2\u20131 in the Championship Play-off.<ref>{{cite news| title=Geylang wins S-League's Championship match| newspaper=The Straits Times}}</ref> They completed the season with another trophy, beating the same team on penalties in the [[Singapore FA Cup]]. As the team was full of international stars such as [[Fandi Ahmad]], [[Kadir Yahaya]], [[David Lee (Singaporean footballer)|David Lee]], [[Hamid Reza Estili]], [[Mohammad Khakpour]], and Chris Riley, [[Vincent Subramaniam]] (Head Coach for SAFFC) identified them as the Manchester United of Singapore. As league champions, they qualified for the [[1997\u201398 Asian Club Championship]] but were eliminated after losing 8\u20132 on aggregate by [[Kashima Antlers]] in the first round.{{fact|date=August 2018}}\n\nThe 1997 season was a disappointing season for them. They failed to defend the S.League title, finishing fifth. The Eagles also failed to defend the FA Cup, after losing to [[SAFFC]] in the finals. They did not win any silverware till [[2001 S.League|2001]], when they won their second league title by a close margin. Both forwards, [[Aleksandar \u0110uri\u0107]] and [[Brian Bothwell]] scored 57 goals for the team. It was the best performing S.League season for the team; scoring 84 goals and conceding 28 goals. Just days after winning the league title, they suffered their worst defeat in history; losing 8\u20130 to [[Home United]] in the [[Singapore Cup]] finals. As league champions, they were guaranteed a slot in the qualifying round of the [[2002\u201303 AFC Champions League]] but were eliminated after losing to [[Shanghai Shenhua]] 5\u20131 on aggregate in the second round.{{fact|date=August 2018}}\n\nThe 2002 season saw Geylang United finish third in both the S.League and Singapore Cup. They came close to winning their third [[S.League]] title and first [[Singapore Cup]] in 2003, only to finish runners-up to [[Home United]] for both competitions. As runners-up, they qualified to play in the [[AFC Cup]] 2004 due to [[Home United]]'s double. Their debut in the [[AFC Cup 2004]] was an impressive one. Despite losing their opening match, they managed to stay unbeaten for their next five games in the group stage.

The stadium has a natural grass football pitch, an 8-lane running track and some athletic facilities. The stadium are closed to the public during official events and S.League matches. The stadium can hold up to 3,900 spectators. The stadium is currently managed by the [[Singapore Sports Council]]. \n\nThe Eagles\u2019 home ground moved to [[Our Tampines Hub]] for the 2019 Singapore Premier League season, which they share with [[Tampines Rovers FC]].\n\nWherever The Eagles play, they are well supported by a loyal and vocal set of supporters called The Ultras Eagles. Usually decked in black and green, they come with loud drums and a strong set of lungs, roaring on the team and setting a matchday scene unlike anything most of Singapore have ever seen. The passionate supporters have also formed a close bond with the team. This is especially evident when the Ultras and The Eagles players and coaching staff  heartily participate in a post match song together, after every game, whether the team wins, loses, or draws. <ref>https://www.goal.com/en-sg/news/geylang-internationals-12th-man-the-geylang-ultras/1arnwebg4avzv12j3o8znota7y</ref>\n\n==Players==\n\n{{updated|27 February 2020}}\n\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no=1|nat=SIN|name=[[Hairul Syirhan]]|pos=GK}}\n{{Fs player|no=2|nat=Singapore|name=[[Shahrin Saberin]]|pos=DF|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=4|nat=SIN|name=[[Nurullah Hussein]]|pos=DF|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=5|nat=SIN|name=[[Darren Teh]]|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no=6|nat=SIN|name=[[Nur Luqman]]|pos=MF|other=}}<sup>'''U23'''</sup>\n{{Fs player|no=7|nat=SIN|name=[[Amy Recha]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=8|nat=NED|name=[[Barry Maguire]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=9|nat=SIN|name=[[Khairul Nizam]]|pos=FW}}\n{{Fs player|no=10|nat=SIN|name=[[Fareez Farhan]]|pos=FW}}\n{{Fs player|no=11|nat=SIN|name=[[Harith Kanadi]]|pos=MF}}<sup>'''U23'''</sup>\n{{Fs player|no=13|nat=SIN|name=[[Joshua Pereira]]|pos=MF|other=}}<sup>'''U23'''</sup>\n{{Fs player|no=14|nat=SIN|name=[[Iqbal Hussain]]|pos=FW|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=15|nat=KGZ|name=[[Kamolidin Tashiev]]|pos=DF}}<sup>'''U21'''</sup>\n{{Fs player|no=16|nat=SIN|name=[[Umar Akhbar]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs mid}}\n{{Fs player|no=17|nat=SIN|name=[[Firdaus Kasman]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=18|nat=SIN|name=[[Azri Suhaili]]|pos=MF}}<sup>'''U23'''</sup>\n{{Fs player|no=19|nat=SIN|name=[[Noor Ariff]]|pos=MF}}<sup>'''U23'''</sup>\n{{Fs player|no=21|nat=JPN|name=[[Yuki Ichikawa]]|pos=DF|other=[[Captain (association football)|Captain]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=22|nat=SIN|name=[[Christopher van Huizen]]|pos=MF|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=24|nat=GRE|name=[[Panagiotis Linardos]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=25|nat=SIN|name=[[Zainol Gulam]]|pos=GK}}\n{{Fs player|no=37  |nat=SIN|name=[[Zikos Chua]]|pos=FW}}\n<sup>'''U23'''</sup>\n{{Fs player|no=49|nat=SIN|name=[[Furqan Raoff]]|pos=MF}}<sup>'''U19'''</sup>\n{{Fs player|no=50|nat=SIN|name=[[Wayne Chew]]|pos=GK}}<sup>'''U19'''</sup>\n{{Fs player|no=55|nat=SIN|name=[[Danish Qayyum]]|pos=DF}}<sup>'''U19'''</sup>\n{{Fs player|no=68|nat=SIN|name=[[Ilhan Noor]]|pos=MF}}<sup>'''U19'''</sup>\n{{Fs player|no=70|nat=SIN|name=[[Danish Haziq]]|pos=FW}}<sup>'''U19'''</sup>\n<sup>'''U23'''</sup>\n{{Fs end}}\n<!--\n{{Fs player|no=1|nat=SIN|name=[[Jasper Chan]]|pos=GK}}\n{{Fs player|no=4|nat=SIN|name=[[Zulfadli Zainal Abidin]]|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no=7|nat=SIN|name=[[Ryan Syaffiq]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=8|nat=SIN|name=[[Azhar Sairudin]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=9|nat=SIN|name=[[Faud Ramli]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=10|nat=JPN|name=[[Fumiya Kogure]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=12|nat=SIN|name=[[Sadiq Rahim]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=13|nat=SIN|name=[[Ryson Yap]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=17|nat=SIN|name=[[Cameron Ayrton Bell]]|pos=FW}}\n{{Fs player|no=20|nat=SIN|name=[[Nor Azli Yusoff]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=22|nat=SIN|name=[[Taufiq Ghani]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=1|nat=SIN|name=[[Nur Amin Malik]]|pos=GK}}\n{{Fs player|no=4|nat=SIN|name=[[Isa Halim]]|pos=MF|other=[[captain (association football)|captain]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=8|nat=ARG|name=[[Ricardo Sendra]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=12|nat=SIN|name=[[Russell Santa Maria]]|pos=GK}}\n{{Fs player|no=13|nat=SIN|name=[[Indra Sahdan Daud]]|pos=FW}}\n{{Fs player|no=14|nat=SIN|name=[[Stanley Ng Yong Woo|Stanley Ng]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=16|nat=CRC|name=[[V\u00edctor Coto Ortega|V\u00edctor Coto]]|pos=FW}}\n{{Fs player|no=18|nat=SIN|name=[[Al-Qaasimy Rahman]]|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no=19|nat=SIN|name=[[Farish Khan]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=25|nat=SIN|name=[[Brandon Koh]]|pos=MF}}\n-->\n<!--\n===Players on loan===\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|nat=SIN|name=[[Anders Aplin]]|pos=DF|other=to [[Matsumoto Yamaga FC|Matsumoto Yamaga]]}}\n{{Fs end}}\n-->\n===Club Captains===\n\n{|\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Former Singapore national captain [[Indra Sahdan]] and [[Carlos Delgado]] were affected. It is believed that the club docked Indra's salary as it is displeased that he missed many training sessions while Delgado had some disagreement with the management over money. Club chairman, Ben Teng revealed that as many as 12 players signed two-year full-time contracts at the beginning of this season. The management committee made most of the decisions regarding the handing out of contracts last season, before Teng came on board to replace [[Leong Kok Fann]]. Teng added that he has spoken to all the players and will intend to honour their contracts. In addition, some players, who supplemented their income by driving for Uber, have been ordered to stop such off-field activity. Teng revealed his concern and decided to impose a ban on such activities. The players have signed declarations that they do not have other employment outside of football. As professional, players should be focused on raising our playing standards and should not be distracted by off-field activities.<ref>https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/football/cloud-over-eagles-amid-lean-times</ref>\n\n===2018 Foreign Players Recruitment===\n\nOn 13 February 2018, Geylang International attempted to recruit foreign players online.

The parish [[Vilar de Mouros]] is well known for the oldest rock festival in Portugal. The seat of the municipality is the town (or ''vila'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]) of Caminha, with 2,500 inhabitants.\n\nThe town is on [[the Portuguese Way]] path of the [[Camino de Santiago]].\n\nThe present Mayor is Lu\u00eds Miguel da Silva Mendon\u00e7a Alves. The municipal holiday is [[Easter Monday]].\n\n==General information==\nCaminha is located 2&nbsp;km from the [[Atlantic Ocean]], on the southern side of the [[Minho River|Minho]] estuary, where this river is met by the smaller and meandering Coura. Here the Minho reaches its widest point (about 2&nbsp;km) and marks the border between Portugal and [[Galiza]]. The highly scenic area, with the wide estuary marked by low-tide [[sandbar]]s, a pastoral and green rural landscape, and pine forests on the slopes of the granitic mountains is increasingly popular for second homes and as a summer resort.\n\n[[Image:Caminha-CCBYSA.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Caminha - Rua Direita, main street of the medieval old town.]]\n\n==History==\nDespite Strabo reference to [[Phoenicia]]n docks in the mouth of the Minho, no further evidence was found. An [[islet]] at the confluence of the Minho and Coura, now connected to the mainland, was the site of a small [[Hispania|Roman]] military settlement. Caminha was called ''Camenae'' or ''Camina'' during the period of [[Sueves|Sueve domination]] in the 5th century. The area was depopulated due to [[Arab]] and [[Normans|Norman]] raids, and slowly reoccupied after the 10th century. Around 1060, during the reign of [[Ferdinand I of Le\u00f3n]], Caminha was briefly a [[county]] and it is known that a castle existed in the area.\n\nIn the 13th century, Caminha was just a fishing village until [[Afonso III of Portugal|King Afonso III]] decided to build a modern castle and a fortified village following the ''bastide'' model, finished in 1260. At that time, the region was of great military importance, since it was located at the border with [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. The castle was later reinforced by Kings [[Dinis I of Portugal|Dinis I]], when reclaimed land finally connected the original island to the shore, and [[Ferdinand I of Portugal|Ferdinand I]]. Although most of the walls and towers were torn down or built over, the oval shape of the castle is still clearly visible in the design of some streets, and the [[keep]] tower is still intact and serves as entrance to the historical centre. The pinewood of ''Camarido'', stabilizing the sandbars at the mouth of the Minho, was another important initiative of Dinis I.\n\nThe first letter of feudal rights ([[foral]]) dates from 1284. Caminha belonged to the crown until [[Ferdinand I of Portugal|King Ferdinand I]] established in 1371 the County of Caminha, whose first count was \u00c1lvaro Pires de Castro. In 1390, King John I granted much freedom to the town (creating a ''p\u00f3voa mar\u00edtima''), leading maritime commerce to flourish. In the 15th and 16th centuries, it became one of the main ports in Northern Portugal, trading extensively with Northern Europe, Africa and India. A witness of this golden age is the main church (''Igreja Matriz''), built between the 15th and 16th centuries in an exuberant late [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]]-[[Portuguese Renaissance|Renaissance]] mixed style. [[Manuel I of Portugal|King Manuel I]] granted Caminha a new [[foral]] in 1512. King Manuel also rebuilt the \u00cdnsua Fort (''Forte da \u00cdnsua''), located in an island at sea and close to the village of Moledo.\n\n[[Image:Torre do Relogio - Caminha.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Old castle [[keep]] of Caminha, turned into a public clock tower in the 17th century. Its gate leads to the historical centre. The building to the right is the municipality.]]\nAfter Portugal regained its independence from Spain in 1640, [[John IV of Portugal|King John IV]] remodeled the fortifications of Caminha following modern ballistic advances. The \u00cdnsua Fort was also remodeled. Together with the fortifications of [[Viana do Castelo, Portugal|Viana do Castelo]], [[Valen\u00e7a, Portugal|Valen\u00e7a]], and [[Mon\u00e7\u00e3o]], the castle of Caminha was part of the defence line against the [[Kingdom of Castile|Castilians]] in the North.\n\nWith time, Caminha was superseded by Viana do Castelo in dominating maritime trade in Northern Portugal. Now Caminha lives from trade and tourism and it is connected to Spain by a car ferry and to the rest of the country by rail and highways.\n\n==Attractions==\nThe large Parish Church (begun 1488) is one of the most significant buildings illustrating the transition from [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] to [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] in Portugal, with [[Manueline]] influence. Several architects from Northern Spain participated in its long construction. The outstanding timber roof in the interior has rich decoration showing Moorish influences ([[Mud\u00e9jar]] style).\n\nOther major points of interest include the main square (Renaissance fountain of 1551), several Gothic and Renaissance houses in the old core and main square, and remains of medieval and 17th-century fortifications. Some pre-Roman archeological findings and ethnographic pieces are shown in the modest Municipal Museum.\n\nThe marshes along the Coura are protected and good for birdwatching.\n\nThe Atlantic beaches in the area are wide and have good sand but tend to be windy for part of the day; the Moledo beach (4&nbsp;km south) attracts surfers.  River and sea excursions can be arranged with local fishermen.\n\nSouth of the Coura, the small granitic range (\"Serra\") of Arga (823 m) provides ample opportunities for hiking, cyclocross and canyoning. In the wooded northern slopes is the small monastery of S. Jo\u00e3o de Arga (popular place for picnics, camping and exploring peaks and streams; also venue for a religious festival) and the village of Castanheira (scenic terraced fields and natural pools).\n\nA weekly market is held every Wednesday.

The parish [[Vilar de Mouros]] is well known for the oldest rock festival in Portugal. The seat of the municipality is the town (or ''vila'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]) of Caminha, with 2,500 inhabitants.\n\nThe town is on [[the Portuguese Way]] path of the [[Camino de Santiago]].\n\nThe present Mayor is Lu\u00eds Miguel da Silva Mendon\u00e7a Alves. The municipal holiday is [[Easter Monday]].\n\n==General information==\nCaminha is located 2&nbsp;km from the [[Atlantic Ocean]], on the southern side of the [[Minho River|Minho]] estuary, where this river is met by the smaller and meandering Coura. Here the Minho reaches its widest point (about 2&nbsp;km) and marks the border between Portugal and [[Galiza]]. The highly scenic area, with the wide estuary marked by low-tide [[sandbar]]s, a pastoral and green rural landscape, and pine forests on the slopes of the granitic mountains is increasingly popular for second homes and as a summer resort.\n\n[[Image:Caminha-CCBYSA.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Caminha - Rua Direita, main street of the medieval old town.]]\n\n==History==\nDespite Strabo reference to [[Phoenicia]]n docks in the mouth of the Minho, no further evidence was found. An [[islet]] at the confluence of the Minho and Coura, now connected to the mainland, was the site of a small [[Hispania|Roman]] military settlement. Caminha was called ''Camenae'' or ''Camina'' during the period of [[Sueves|Sueve domination]] in the 5th century. The area was depopulated due to [[Arab]] and [[Normans|Norman]] raids, and slowly reoccupied after the 10th century. Around 1060, during the reign of [[Ferdinand I of Le\u00f3n]], Caminha was briefly a [[county]] and it is known that a castle existed in the area.\n\nIn the 13th century, Caminha was just a fishing village until [[Afonso III of Portugal|King Afonso III]] decided to build a modern castle and a fortified village following the ''bastide'' model, finished in 1260. At that time, the region was of great military importance, since it was located at the border with [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. The castle was later reinforced by Kings [[Dinis I of Portugal|Dinis I]], when reclaimed land finally connected the original island to the shore, and [[Ferdinand I of Portugal|Ferdinand I]]. Although most of the walls and towers were torn down or built over, the oval shape of the castle is still clearly visible in the design of some streets, and the [[keep]] tower is still intact and serves as entrance to the historical centre. The pinewood of ''Camarido'', stabilizing the sandbars at the mouth of the Minho, was another important initiative of Dinis I.\n\nThe first letter of feudal rights ([[foral]]) dates from 1284. Caminha belonged to the crown until [[Ferdinand I of Portugal|King Ferdinand I]] established in 1371 the County of Caminha, whose first count was \u00c1lvaro Pires de Castro. In 1390, King John I granted much freedom to the town (creating a ''p\u00f3voa mar\u00edtima''), leading maritime commerce to flourish. In the 15th and 16th centuries, it became one of the main ports in Northern Portugal, trading extensively with Northern Europe, Africa and India. A witness of this golden age is the main church (''Igreja Matriz''), built between the 15th and 16th centuries in an exuberant late [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]]-[[Portuguese Renaissance|Renaissance]] mixed style. [[Manuel I of Portugal|King Manuel I]] granted Caminha a new [[foral]] in 1512. King Manuel also rebuilt the \u00cdnsua Fort (''Forte da \u00cdnsua''), located in an island at sea and close to the village of Moledo.\n\n[[Image:Torre do Relogio - Caminha.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Old castle [[keep]] of Caminha, turned into a public clock tower in the 17th century. Its gate leads to the historical centre. The building to the right is the municipality.]]\nAfter Portugal regained its independence from Spain in 1640, [[John IV of Portugal|King John IV]] remodeled the fortifications of Caminha following modern ballistic advances. The \u00cdnsua Fort was also remodeled. Together with the fortifications of [[Viana do Castelo, Portugal|Viana do Castelo]], [[Valen\u00e7a, Portugal|Valen\u00e7a]], and [[Mon\u00e7\u00e3o]], the castle of Caminha was part of the defence line against the [[Kingdom of Castile|Castilians]] in the North.\n\nWith time, Caminha was superseded by Viana do Castelo in dominating maritime trade in Northern Portugal. Now Caminha lives from trade and tourism and it is connected to Spain by a car ferry and to the rest of the country by rail and highways.\n\n==Attractions==\nThe large Parish Church (begun 1488) is one of the most significant buildings illustrating the transition from [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] to [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] in Portugal, with [[Manueline]] influence. Several architects from Northern Spain participated in its long construction. The outstanding timber roof in the interior has rich decoration showing Moorish influences ([[Mud\u00e9jar]] style).\n\nOther major points of interest include the main square (Renaissance fountain of 1551), several Gothic and Renaissance houses in the old core and main square, and remains of medieval and 17th-century fortifications. Some pre-Roman archeological findings and ethnographic pieces are shown in the modest Municipal Museum.\n\nThe marshes along the Coura are protected and good for birdwatching.\n\nThe Atlantic beaches in the area are wide and have good sand but tend to be windy for part of the day; the Moledo beach (4&nbsp;km south) attracts surfers.  River and sea excursions can be arranged with local fishermen.\n\nSouth of the Coura, the small granitic range (\"Serra\") of Arga (823 m) provides ample opportunities for hiking, cyclocross and canyoning. In the wooded northern slopes is the small monastery of S. Jo\u00e3o de Arga (popular place for picnics, camping and exploring peaks and streams; also venue for a religious festival) and the village of Castanheira (scenic terraced fields and natural pools).\n\nA weekly market is held every Wednesday. Work from local coppersmiths and lacemakers can be found around town.\n\n[[Image:Igreja Matriz de Caminha.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Parish church of Caminha (early 16th century).]]\n[[Image:Caminha and the Minho river.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Caminha and the Minho river]]\n\n==Parishes==\nAdministratively, the municipality is divided into 14 civil parishes (''[[freguesia (Portugal)|freguesias]]''):<ref>{{cite web|title=Law nr. 11-A/2013, pages 552 31-32|url=http://dre.pt/pdf1sdip/2013/01/01901/0000200147.pdf |accessdate=20 July 2014|author=''[[Di\u00e1rio da Rep\u00fablica]]''|language=Portuguese|format=pdf}}</ref>\n* \u00c2ncora\n* Arga (Baixo, Cima e S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o)\n* Argela\n* Caminha (Matriz) e Vilarelho\n* Dem\n* Gondar e Orbac\u00e9m\n* Lanhelas\n* Moledo e Cristelo\n* Riba de \u00c2ncora\n* Seixas\n* Venade e Azevedo\n* Vila Praia de \u00c2ncora\n* [[Vilar de Mouros]]\n* Vile\n\n==Population==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"9\" | Population of Caminha municipality (1801\u20132011)\n|- bgcolor=\"#C0C0C0\"\n| align=\"center\" | 1801 \n| align=\"center\" | 1849 \n| align=\"center\" | 1900 \n| align=\"center\" | 1930\n| align=\"center\" | 1960\n| align=\"center\" | 1981\n| align=\"center\" | 1991\n| align=\"center\" | 2001\n| align=\"center\" | 2011\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 9,251\n| align=\"center\" | 12,167\n| align=\"center\" | 15,288\n| align=\"center\" | 15,810\n| align=\"center\" | 16,688\n| align=\"center\" | 15,883\n| align=\"center\" | 16,207\n| align=\"center\" | 17,069\n| align=\"center\" | 16,684\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons}}\n*[http://www.cm-caminha.pt Municipality official website]\n\n{{Municipalities of Viana do Castelo}}\n\n[[Category:Municipalities of Portugal]]\n[[Category:Caminha| ]]\n", "name_user": "Markussep", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caminha"}

For example, a server has a list of stock prices (i.e. a resource) and the client would like to display these prices in some nice graphs.\n\nThere is a clear separation of concerns between the two. The server takes care of the back-end stuff (data storage, business rules, etc.) and the client handles the front-end stuff (user interfaces).\n\nThe separation means that there can be many different types of clients (web portals, mobile apps, BPM engines, etc.) that access the same server, and each of these can evolve independently of the other clients and the server (assuming that the interface between the clients and server is stable).\n\nThe separation also seriously reduces the complexity of the server, as it doesn\u2019t need to deal with UI stuff, which improves scalability.\n<br />\n\n=== Stateless ===\nTo further simplify interactions between clients and servers, the second constraint is that the communication between them must be stateless.\n\nThis means that all information about the client\u2019s session is kept on the client, and the server knows nothing of it (so no cookies, session variables, or other naughty stuff!) The consequence is that each request must contain all information necessary to perform the request (i.e. it cannot rely on any context information).\n<br />\n\n=== Cache ===\nThe last constraint on the client-server communication is that responses from servers must be marked as cacheable or non-cacheable.\n\nAn effective cache can reduce the number of client-server interactions, which contributes positively to the performance of the system. At least, from a user\u2019s point of view.\n\nProtocols, like SOAP, that only uses HTTP as a convenient way to get through firewalls (by using POST for all requests) miss out on the improved performance from HTTP caching, which reduces their performance (and also slightly undermines the basic purpose of a firewall.)\n<br />\n\n=== Cod ===\nCode-on-Demand (COD) is the only optional constraint in REST. It allows clients to improve its flexibility because in  fact it is the server who decides how certain things will be done. For instance, with Code-On-Demand, a client can download a javascript, java applet or even a flash application in order to encrypt communication so servers are not aware of any encryption routines / keys used in this process.\n\nHowever, using COD reduces visibility, which is why this constraint is optional. Also, not every API needs this kind of flexibility.\n\n\n==See also==\n*[[Remote evaluation]]\n*[[Code mobility]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Code On Demand}}\n[[Category:Internet Protocol based network software]]\n[[Category:Software distribution]]\n\n3. http://restcookbook.com/Basics/codeondemand/\n\n4. https://www.kennethlange.com/what-are-restful-web-services/\n\n5. https://www.pjohnson.info/2015/03/31/code-on-demand-what-is-it/\n\n6. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32094952/code-demand-constraint-for-restful-apis\n\n\n{{Comp-sci-stub}}\n", "text_old": "In [[distributed computing]], '''code on demand''' is any technology that sends executable software code from a server computer to a client computer upon request from the client's software.

It serves as the official [[app store]] for the [[Android (operating system)|Android operating system]], allowing users to browse and download applications developed with the [[Android software development|Android software development kit]] (SDK) and published through Google. Google Play also serves as a [[digital media]] store, offering music, books, movies, and television programs. It previously offered Google hardware devices for purchase until the introduction of a separate online hardware retailer, [[Google Store]], on March 11, 2015, and it also offered news publications and magazines before the revamp of [[Google News]] on May 15, 2018.\n\nApplications are available through Google Play either free of charge or at a cost. They can be downloaded directly on an Android device through the Play Store [[mobile app]] or by [[Software deployment|deploying]] the application to a device from the Google Play website. Applications exploiting hardware capabilities of a device can be targeted to users of devices with specific hardware components, such as a motion sensor (for motion-dependent games) or a front-facing camera (for online video calling). The Google Play store had over 82 billion app downloads in 2016 and has reached over 3.5 million apps published in 2017.<ref name=\"3.5 million apps\"/> It has been the subject of multiple issues concerning security, in which [[Malware|malicious software]] has been approved and uploaded to the store and downloaded by users, with varying degrees of severity.\n\nGoogle Play was launched on March 6, 2012, bringing together Android Market, Google Music, and the Google eBookstore under one brand, marking a shift in Google's digital distribution strategy. The services included in Google Play are [[Google Play Books]], [[Google Play Games]], [[Google Play Movies & TV]] and [[Google Play Music]].

The application used a [[JavaScript]] exploit to steal contacts, SMS messages, and photos, and was also capable of making the phone open arbitrary web pages or launch [[denial-of-service attack]]s. Nicholas Percoco, senior vice president of Trustwave's SpiderLabs advanced security team, stated that \"We wanted to test the bounds of what it's capable of\". The app stayed on Google Play for more than two weeks, being repeatedly scanned by the Bouncer system without detection, with Percoco further saying that \"As an attack, all a malware attacker has to do to get into Google Play is to bypass Bouncer\".

It serves as the official [[app store]] for the [[Android (operating system)|Android operating system]], allowing users to browse and download applications developed with the [[Android software development|Android software development kit]] (SDK) and published through Google. Google Play also serves as a [[digital media]] store, offering music, books, movies, and television programs. It previously offered Google hardware devices for purchase until the introduction of a separate online hardware retailer, [[Google Store]], on March 11, 2015, and it also offered news publications and magazines before the revamp of [[Google News]] on May 15, 2018.\n\nApplications are available through Google Play either free of charge or at a cost. They can be downloaded directly on an Android device through the Play Store [[mobile app]] or by [[Software deployment|deploying]] the application to a device from the Google Play website. Applications exploiting hardware capabilities of a device can be targeted to users of devices with specific hardware components, such as a motion sensor (for motion-dependent games) or a front-facing camera (for online video calling). The Google Play store had over 82 billion app downloads in 2016 and has reached over 3.5 million apps published in 2017.<ref name=\"3.5 million apps\"/> It has been the subject of multiple issues concerning security, in which [[Malware|malicious software]] has been approved and uploaded to the store and downloaded by users, with varying degrees of severity.\n\nGoogle Play was launched on March 6, 2012, bringing together Android Market, Google Music, and the Google eBookstore under one brand, marking a shift in Google's digital distribution strategy. The services included in Google Play are [[Google Play Books]], [[Google Play Games]], [[Google Play Movies & TV]] and [[Google Play Music]]. Following their re-branding, Google has gradually expanded the geographical support for each of the services.\n\n== Catalog content ==\n\n=== Android applications ===\n{{Further|Android (operating

The application used a [[JavaScript]] exploit to steal contacts, SMS messages, and photos, and was also capable of making the phone open arbitrary web pages or launch [[denial-of-service attack]]s. Nicholas Percoco, senior vice president of Trustwave's SpiderLabs advanced security team, stated that \"We wanted to test the bounds of what it's capable of\". The app stayed on Google Play for more than two weeks, being repeatedly scanned by the Bouncer system without detection, with Percoco further saying that \"As an attack, all a malware attacker has to do to get into Google Play is to bypass Bouncer\".

This season featured 11 teams of two, with a pre-existing relationship, in a race around the world.\n\nThe season premiered on Sunday, February 15, 2009, at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|ET]]/[[Pacific Time Zone|PT]] and aired on Sunday nights<ref name=TAR14>{{cite web|url=http://thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20081202cbs02|title=CBS Announced Mid-season Programming Plans|publisher=the Futon Critic|date=2008-12-02|accessdate=2008-12-03}}</ref> with the season finale on May 10, 2009. The show was again hosted by [[Phil Keoghan]].\n\nSiblings [[Tammy Jih Murray|Tamara Tien-Jan \"Tammy\"]] and [[Victor Jih]] were the winners of the ''Race'' and were the first [[Asian American]] contestants to win the competition.\n\nThe complete season was released on DVD on May 21, 2014.\n\n==Production==\n===Development and filming===\n[[File:HSL-47 Flyoff.jpg|thumb|Teams were brought to the Race's Starting Line at [[Joint Forces Training Base - Los Alamitos|Los Alamitos Joint Forces Training Base]] in [[California]] by [[Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk|Seahawks]].]]\n''The Amazing Race 14'' lasted for 22 days and traveled over {{convert|40000|mi|km}}. The teams raced in nine countries, including [[Romania]] and the region of [[Siberia]] for the first time, as well as: [[Switzerland]], [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[India]], [[China]], [[Thailand]], and [[Russia]] ([[Krasnoyarsk]] and [[Novosibirsk]]), with the Finish Line in [[Maui]], [[Hawaii]]. In an interview, [[executive producer]] [[Bertram van Munster]] revealed that the teams took a 13-hour train ride on the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]], and got into a [[Siberia]]n [[Winter storm|snowstorm]] with below-zero temperatures.<ref name=AP/><ref name=USAT>{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/travel/news/2009-02-12-amazing-race_N.htm|title='The Amazing Race' is back with more scenery, fewer days|last=Levin|first=Gary|date=2009-02-12|publisher=USATODAY.com|accessdate=2009-02-13}}</ref> He also revealed that the teams suffered extreme climates, intense Roadblocks, and less time in airports, which added up to an exhausting course for the racers. In addition, [[CBS]] revealed the ''Race'' included the world's second tallest [[bungee jumping|bungee jump]], suffocating heat in India, and an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]]-themed challenge that left the teams \"gasping for air.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=CBS reveals 'The Amazing Race's fourteenth season cast identities|last=Bracchitta|first=John|date=2009-01-26|publisher=Reality TV World}}</ref>\n\nThe show's route map was updated via [[Google Earth]], and according to Bertram van Munster prior to the show's debut, the season included new graphics, a new opening sequence (consequently, the team videos preceding a team's close up are updated throughout the season to reflect tasks that have already been completed), and a tuneup in the musical score (still keeping the key in B flat minor),<ref name=USAT/> as well as the use of a [[Split screen (filmmaking)|split screen]] to show several scenes at the same time. This season also changed its main team names and route info font from [[Microgramma (typeface)|Microgramma]] to [[Bank Gothic]].\n\nSeason 14 introduced a new twist to the [[U-Turn (The Amazing Race)|U-Turn]]: the U-Turn in Leg 4 was a Blind U-Turn, in which the team electing to use it did so anonymously; other U-Turns (and the [[The Amazing Race#Yield|Yields]] that were replaced) required teams utilizing them to acknowledge their use to subsequent teams. The U-Turn in the second half of Leg 10 was a normal U-Turn.\n\nLeg 10 was a [[The Amazing Race#Double-length legs|double-length leg]], a surprise feature of every ''Race'' from [[The Amazing Race 6|Season 6]] to [[The Amazing Race 10|Season 10]] but has not been seen since; however, this double-length leg was the first where it was revealed to the teams at a location that was explicitly called a Pit Stop but teams were not warned of an elimination in the clue. In previous seasons, teams were either given some implicit reference to a Pit Stop, such as \"go and meet [[Phil Keoghan]] at the mat\" and were handed their next clue by Keoghan or were given a clue to continue racing at a clue box where a clue directing teams to the Pit Stop would have been expected. This time however, after checking in, teams were told \"this leg of the ''Race'' is not over\" and were given a clue to continue racing.\n\nMel & Mike confirmed in a post-race interview that there was an unaired, unused, Fast Forward in Leg 7 that involved purchasing items for an orphanage using the team's own money.<ref name=\"UnairedFF\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fancast.com/blogs/the-amazing-race/the-amazing-race-mike-and-mel-failed-to-obey-the-law-of-the-pack/ |title=Mel & Mike interview |publisher=fancast.com |date=2009-03-31 |accessdate=2009-03-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401031033/http://www.fancast.com/blogs/the-amazing-race/the-amazing-race-mike-and-mel-failed-to-obey-the-law-of-the-pack/ |archivedate=April 1, 2009 }}</ref> This was the first season ever where no team took the Fast Forward option throughout the ''Race''.\n\nThe [[Maui]] Finish Line was the southernmost finish location in the American version of the ''Race''.\n\n===Cast===\n{{see also|List of The Amazing Race (American TV series) contestants}}\nApplications were due on May 28, 2008. Semi-finalist interviews were held sometime in June 2008, and the final casting interviews were held in [[Los Angeles]] around late June or early July 2008.

CBS posted short videos on its website after each episode aired in the Pacific time zone to show the eliminated teams interacting at the villa.\n*After '''Leg 1''', Preston & Jennifer were the first team eliminated and were sent to the villa. They expressed their disappointment at being eliminated first and believed that Steve & Linda would be eliminated next. They also discussed who they believe are strong teams and got into an argument over the factors that led to their elimination.\n*After '''Leg 2''', Steve & Linda were the second team eliminated and were sent to the villa. Steve openly complained about Preston & Jennifer refusing to form an alliance with him and Linda during the first leg, which irritated Preston. Later in the day, the two eliminated teams decided to take a trip to a local [[snake farm]], and then went out to eat. They then predicted that either Christie & Jodi or Jaime & Cara would be the next team eliminated.\n*After '''Leg 3''', Brad & Victoria were the third team eliminated and were sent to the villa. Their arrival surprised the other two eliminated teams. While recounting the events leading to her and Brad's elimination, Victoria broke down into tears. Tensions developed between Steve & Linda and Preston & Jennifer during the conversation, as Jennifer was perceived as an incessant talker, even interrupting Linda at one point. The next morning, the three eliminated teams visited a Buddhist temple, receiving a blessing of good luck from a monk.\n*After '''Leg 4''', Amanda & Kris were the fourth team eliminated and were sent to the villa. They talked about what happened during the Leg, erroneously deducing that it was either Christie & Jodi or Kisha & Jen who had U-Turned them. Afterward, the four eliminated teams went to the beach to celebrate [[Loy Krathong]].\n*'''Leg 5''' was a non-elimination leg, hence no new teams were sent to the villa. The eliminated teams received [[Thai massage]]s and went [[ziplining]].\n*After '''Leg 6''', Christie & Jodi were the fifth team eliminated and were sent to the villa. They first told Amanda & Kris that it was Margie & Luke who U-Turned them, which came as a shock to everyone. Tension developed between Steve and the rest of the group, especially Preston & Jennifer. Steve accused the group of shunning him and Linda, leading to an argument.\n*After '''Leg 7''', Mel & Mike were the sixth team eliminated and were sent to the villa. They noted how the remaining teams on the ''Race'' are becoming more competitive. Afterward, everyone went shopping at a nearby marketplace. Tension continued to grow between Preston & Jennifer when Preston became irritated with her over her buying another purse.\n*'''Leg 8''' was a non-elimination leg, so no new teams were eliminated. Due to their constant arguing, Preston & Jennifer chose to spend some time away from each other. The eliminated teams spent the day [[snorkeling]] and [[kayaking]] at an island.\n*After '''Leg 9''', Mark & Michael were the seventh team eliminated. Before receiving a phone call from the latest team that was eliminated, the eliminated teams at the villa went on a safari, most notably riding an elephant. Afterward, Mark & Michael called the villa to inform the other teams of their elimination and told them of the time penalties that led to their elimination. All teams agreed that they wanted to see Jaime & Cara eliminated next.\n*'''Leg 10''' is a double-length leg, shown over two episodes. A new episode of Elimination Station was posted after each half aired:\n**The first half ended with a Virtual Pit Stop (no elimination). Elimination Station showed the sequestered teams on their last day at the Elimination Station, where the teams discussed their time together and who they wanted to see win the ''Race''. As the eliminated teams packed for their trip to the End City, each of the teams further reminisced about their stay at the Elimination Station.\n**After the second half of the leg, Kisha & Jen were the eighth and final team eliminated. Elimination Station showed the six eliminated teams arriving at the End City in [[Maui, Hawaii]]. After arriving in Maui, the teams checked into a hotel. Once they checked in, they swam and snorkeled at the beach, then returned to the hotel to await a phone call from the eighth team eliminated. The six eliminated teams at the hotel were shocked and disappointed to hear about Kisha & Jen's elimination, especially Preston & Jennifer who wanted them to win. Kisha & Jen told them about what went wrong during the second half of Leg 10 and on the part where they were U-Turned by Tammy & Victor. Kisha & Jen said they wanted to see either Jaime & Cara or Tammy & Victor win, despite having been U-Turned by the latter. Kisha and Jen then told the other eliminated teams that they would meet again at the Finish Line before hanging up. The eliminated teams then shared their thoughts about the upcoming final leg of the ''Race'', many of them expressing their shock over the fact that Jaime & Cara were one of the final three teams.\n*'''Leg 11''' was the final leg of ''The Amazing Race 14''. Mark & Michael and Kisha & Jen reunited with the other eliminated teams at the Finish Line at [[King Kamehameha Golf Club]]. Many teams believed that Tammy & Victor would win the ''Race'', while Kisha & Jen noted that Margie & Luke had gotten more tense with each other. Teams expressed their opinions about the final three teams at the Finish Line along with their joys and disappointments.\n\n==Race summary==\n[[File:The Amazing Race 14 map.png|250px|thumb|The Route of the Race]]\n{{TAR Captionbox|Style3}}\n\n===Leg 1 (United States \u2192 Switzerland)===\n[[File:Embankment dam (2840437848).jpg|thumb|While in [[Switzerland]], teams traveled to [[Verzasca Dam]] near [[Locarno]] to perform the second-highest commercial bungee jump in the world.]]\n'''Airdate''': February 15, 2009\n*[[Los Alamitos, California|Los Alamitos]], [[California]] {{flagicon|California}}, '''[[United States]]''' {{flagicon|USA}} ([[Joint Forces Training Base - Los Alamitos|Los Alamitos Joint Forces Training Base]]) (Starting Line)\n*{{TAR travel|flight}} [[Los Angeles]] ([[Los Angeles International Airport]]) to [[Zurich metropolitan area|Z\u00fcrich]], '''[[Switzerland]]''' {{flagicon|SWI}} ([[Zurich Airport]]) ''or'' [[Milan metropolitan area|Milan]], [[Italy]] {{flagicon|ITA}} ([[Milan Malpensa Airport]])\n*{{TAR travel|train}} [[Kloten]] ([[Z\u00fcrich Airport railway station|Z\u00fcrich Airport Railway Station]]) ''or'' [[Chiasso]] ([[Chiasso railway station|Chiasso Railway Station]]) to [[Locarno]] ([[Locarno railway station|Stazione di Locarno]])\n*Locarno ([https://www.parrocchialocarno.ch/ Church of Sant'Antonio]) (Overnight Rest in [http://www.locarno.ch/pages/uff_content.aspx?id_contenuto=425 Parco Robinson])\n*[[Tenero-Contra]] ([[Contra Dam|Verzasca Dam]]) {{TAR clue|Roadblock|Who has nerves of steel?}}\n*{{TAR travel|train}} Locarno (Stazione di Locarno) to [[Interlaken]] ([[Interlaken Ost railway station|Interlaken Ost]])\n*Interlaken (Kleine Rugen Wiese) \n*[[Stechelberg]] ([[PostBus Switzerland|PostAuto Stop]] \u2013 [http://hotelstechelberg.tcnet.ch/ Hotel Stechelberg])\n*Stechelberg ([http://www.alpenhof-stechelberg.ch/pages/en/home.html Alpenhof Stechelberg]) {{TAR clue|Pit Stop|1}}\n\nThe first Roadblock of the ''Race'' required one team member to [[bungee jumping|bungee jump]] off the Verzasca Dam, the second highest commercial bungee in the world, at a height of 70 stories in order to receive their next clue.\n\n;Additional tasks\n*At the Church of Sant'Antonio, teams signed up for one of three departure times for the following morning. When they departed in the next morning, teams would be given a picture from a priest and were left to figure out the next clue was located at [[Verzasca Dam]]. \n*At Kleine Rugen Wiese in [[Interlaken]], teams had to transport four {{convert|50|lb|kg|adj=on}} wheels of [[cheese]] from a shed to the bottom of a hill using traditional [[Swiss cheese]] carriers. Once the cheese was stacked, they would get their next clue. This task would be featured again in [[The Amazing Race 22#Leg 8 (Botswana \u2192 Switzerland)|Season 22]] as a Switchback.\n*Once in [[Stechelberg]], teams had to listen to a group of [[yodeling|yodelers]], who would lead them to the Pit Stop mat.\n\n;Additional note\n*After the ''Race'' began, teams made their way to [[Los Angeles International Airport]] to reserve one of two flights. The first flight, which had room for six teams, would travel to [[Z\u00fcrich]], while the second flight traveled to [[Milan]], [[Italy]] 25 minutes later. After arriving in either city, teams had to take a train to [[Locarno]].\n\n===Leg 2 (Switzerland \u2192 Germany \u2192 Austria)===\n[[File:St.Bartholom\u00e4.jpg|thumb|While in [[Germany]], teams visited the lake town of [[Sch\u00f6nau am K\u00f6nigsee]] deep in the [[Bavarian Alps]].]]\n'''Airdate''': February 22, 2009\n*{{TAR travel|flight}} Z\u00fcrich (Zurich Airport) to [[Munich]], [[Bavaria]], '''[[Germany]]''' {{flagicon|GER}} ([[Munich Airport]])\n*{{TAR travel|gondola}} [[Ruhpolding]], [[Traunstein]] ([[Rauschberg]]) {{TAR clue|Roadblock|Who's ready to fly like an eagle?}}\n*[[Sch\u00f6nau am K\u00f6nigssee]], [[Berchtesgadener Land]] ([[K\u00f6nigssee bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton track|Bobsled Track]]) {{TAR clue|Detour|Balancing Dolly|Austrian Folly}}\n*Sch\u00f6nau am K\u00f6nigssee ([[Sawyer (occupation)|Holzs\u00e4ger]])\n*[[Salzburg]], '''[[Austria]]''' {{flagicon|AUT}} ([[Hellbrunn Palace|Schloss Hellbrunn]]) {{TAR clue|Pit Stop|2}}\n\nFor this Roadblock, one team member had to choose an instructor and tandem [[Paragliding|paraglide]] off a mountain {{convert|6000|ft|m}} below to a landing area, where their partner was waiting with their next clue. In the event of unfavorable winds, they had a choice between waiting an undetermined amount of time for optimal conditions or taking a 60-minute hike down the mountain.\n\nThe first Detour of the ''Race'' was a choice between Balancing Dolly or Austrian Folly. In Balancing Dolly, each team member had to navigate a [[Segway PT|Segways]] over a {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=on}} road obstacle course to get their next clue. In Austrian Folly, teams had to enter a party tent and throw Bavarian pies at a target, unaware that their target would be their partner's face. They had to take turns smacking each other in the face until they found a pie with cherry filling to receive their next clue.\n\n;Additional tasks\n*Upon arrival in [[Munich]], teams had to drive to the village of [[Ruhpolding]] and ride a cable car to [[Rauschberg]] for their next clue.\n*After completing the Detour, teams made their way to ''Holzs\u00e4ger'', a woodcutting workshop. Teams had to wait for the Tyrolean woodcutters to cut a piece of wood. Once teams had their piece of wood, it would be stamped with their next destination.\n\n===Leg 3 (Austria \u2192 Romania)===\n[[File:Bran Castle TB1.jpg|thumb|Teams ended the leg in [[Romania]] in the shadow of [[Bran Castle]] in [[Transylvania]], the fabled home of [[Dracula]].]]\n'''Airdate''': March 1, 2009\n*{{TAR travel|train}} Salzburg ([[Salzburg Hauptbahnhof]]) to [[Oberding]], Germany ([[Munich Airport Terminal station|Munich Airport Terminal Station]])\n*{{TAR travel|flight}} Munich (Munich Airport) to [[Bucharest]], '''[[Romania]]''' {{flagicon|ROU}} ([[Henri Coand\u0103 International Airport]])\n*Bucharest ([[Lia Manoliu]] [http://www.csnliamanoliu.ro/ National Sports Complex] {{in lang|ro}}) {{TAR clue|Roadblock|Who's ready to access their inner Nadia?}}\n*{{TAR travel|train}} Bucharest ([[Bucharest North railway station|Gara de Nord]]) to [[Bra\u0219ov]] ([[Bra\u0219ov railway station|Bra\u0219ov Railway Station]])\n*Bra\u0219ov ([[Biserica Neagr\u0103]]) {{TAR clue|Detour|Gypsy Moves|Vampire Remains}}\n*[[Bran, Bra\u0219ov|Bran]] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20120421033634/http://www.panoramic.ro/ Vila Panoramic] overlooking [[Bran Castle]]) {{TAR clue|Pit Stop|3}}\n\nThe Roadblock for this leg was in honor of notable gymnast [[Nadia Com\u0103neci]]. For this task, one team member had to go through a series of moves for three [[gymnastics]] disciplines: the [[balance beam]], the [[parallel bars]], and [[Floor (gymnastics)|floor exercises]] before receiving their next clue.\n\nThe Detour was a choice between Gypsy Moves or Vampire Remains. In Gypsy Moves, teams made their way to a [[Romani people|gypsy]] encampment and help a family of gypsies move from one camp to another by loading their belongings on a traditional horse-drawn cart and unloading them at another location. Once all of the belongings were stacked, the head of the family would give the team their next clue. In Vampire Remains, teams had to drag a chained coffin to a field of stakes in the shadow of [[Bran Castle]]. There, they had to undo the coffin's chains to find several antique frames which they then had to [[impalement|impale]] them by smashing the stakes, referencing [[Vlad the Impaler]], who inspired [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]'', until they found one containing a ''Race'' flag that they could trade them for their next clue.\n\n===Leg 4 (Romania \u2192 Russia)===\n[[File:Banknote 10 rubles 2004 back.jpg|right|thumb|After arriving in the city of [[Krasnoyarsk]] in [[Siberia]], teams were only given a 10 [[Russian ruble|ruble]] bill and were told to head to the location featured on the banknote: the [[Krasnoyarsk Dam]].]]\n'''Airdate''': March 8, 2009\n*{{TAR travel|flight}} Bucharest (Henri Coand\u01ce International Airport) to [[Krasnoyarsk]], [[Siberia]], '''[[Russia]]''' {{flagicon|RUS}} ([[Krasnoyarsk International Airport]])\n*[[Divnogorsk]] ([[Krasnoyarsk Dam|Krasnoyarsk Hydroelectric Dam]])\n*Divnogorsk ([[Ovsyanka, Krasnoyarsk Krai|Ovsyanka Village]] \u2013 Church of [[Innocent of Irkutsk|Saint Innokenty]]) {{TAR clue|Detour|Stack|Construct}}\n*Divnogorsk (Ovsyanka Village \u2013 Museum of The Last Bow) {{TAR clue|U-Turn|Margie & Luke|Amanda & Kris|blind=yes}}\n*Krasnoyarsk ([https://bobrovylog.ru/ Bobrovy Log Park]) {{TAR clue|Roadblock|Who's ready to speed read?}}\n*Krasnoyarsk ([[:ru:\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u044f\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0442\u0435\u0430\u0442\u0440|Krasnoyarsk Theater of Musical Comedy]] {{in lang|ru}}) {{TAR clue|Pit Stop|4}}\n\nThe Detour for the leg was a choice between Stack or Construct. In Stack, teams had to stack wood into a large wall formation in front of an existing stack. If their wall collapsed into the existing one, they would have to rebuild both. Once the wood was properly stacked, a lumberjack would give them their next clue.

This season also changed its main team names and route info font from [[Microgramma (typeface)|Microgramma]] to [[Bank Gothic]].\n\nSeason 14 introduced a new twist to the [[U-Turn (The Amazing Race)|U-Turn]]: the U-Turn in Leg 4 was a Blind U-Turn, in which the team electing to use it did so anonymously; other U-Turns (and the [[The Amazing Race#Yield|Yields]] that were replaced) required teams utilizing them to acknowledge their use to subsequent teams. The U-Turn in the second half of Leg 10 was a normal U-Turn.\n\nLeg 10 was a [[The Amazing Race#Double-length legs|double-length leg]], a surprise feature of every ''Race'' from [[The Amazing Race 6|Season 6]] to [[The Amazing Race 10|Season 10]] but has not been seen since; however, this double-length leg was the first where it was revealed to the teams at a location that was explicitly called a Pit Stop but teams were not warned of an elimination in the clue. In previous seasons, teams were either given some implicit reference to a Pit Stop, such as \"go and meet [[Phil Keoghan]] at the mat\" and were handed their next clue by Keoghan or were given a clue to continue racing at a clue box where a clue directing teams to the Pit Stop would have been expected. This time however, after checking in, teams were told \"this leg of the ''Race'' is not over\" and were given a clue to continue racing.\n\nMel & Mike confirmed in a post-race interview that there was an unaired, unused, Fast Forward in Leg 7 that involved purchasing items for an orphanage using the team's own money.<ref name=\"UnairedFF\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fancast.com/blogs/the-amazing-race/the-amazing-race-mike-and-mel-failed-to-obey-the-law-of-the-pack/ |title=Mel & Mike interview |publisher=fancast.com |date=2009-03-31 |accessdate=2009-03-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401031033/http://www.fancast.com/blogs/the-amazing-race/the-amazing-race-mike-and-mel-failed-to-obey-the-law-of-the-pack/ |archivedate=April 1, 2009 }}</ref> This was the first season ever where no team took the Fast Forward option throughout the ''Race''.\n\nThe [[Maui]] Finish Line was the southernmost finish location in the American version of the ''Race''.\n\n===Cast===\n{{see also|List of The Amazing Race (American TV series) contestants}}\nApplications were due on May 28, 2008.

CBS posted short videos on its website after each episode aired in the Pacific time zone to show the eliminated teams interacting at the villa.\n*After '''Leg 1''', Preston & Jennifer were the first team eliminated and were sent to the villa. They expressed their disappointment at being eliminated first and believed that Steve & Linda would be eliminated next. They also discussed who they believe are strong teams and got into an argument over the factors that led to their elimination.\n*After '''Leg 2''', Steve & Linda were the second team eliminated and were sent to the villa. Steve openly complained about Preston & Jennifer refusing to form an alliance with him and Linda during the first leg, which irritated Preston. Later in the day, the two eliminated teams decided to take a trip to a local [[snake farm]], and then went out to eat. They then predicted that either Christie & Jodi or Jaime & Cara would be the next team eliminated.\n*After '''Leg 3''', Brad & Victoria were the third team eliminated and were sent to the villa. Their arrival surprised the other two eliminated teams. While recounting the events leading to her and Brad's elimination, Victoria broke down into tears. Tensions developed between Steve & Linda and Preston & Jennifer during the conversation, as Jennifer was perceived as an incessant talker, even interrupting Linda at one point. The next morning, the three eliminated teams visited a Buddhist temple, receiving a blessing of good luck from a monk.\n*After '''Leg 4''', Amanda & Kris were the fourth team eliminated and were sent to the villa. They talked about what happened during the Leg, erroneously deducing that it was either Christie & Jodi or Kisha & Jen who had U-Turned them. Afterward, the four eliminated teams went to the beach to celebrate [[Loy Krathong]].\n*'''Leg 5''' was a non-elimination leg, hence no new teams were sent to the villa. The eliminated teams received [[Thai massage]]s and went [[ziplining]].\n*After '''Leg 6''', Christie & Jodi were the fifth team eliminated and were sent to the villa. They first told Amanda & Kris that it was Margie & Luke who U-Turned them, which came as a shock to everyone. Tension developed between Steve and the rest of the group, especially Preston & Jennifer. Steve accused the group of shunning him and Linda, leading to an argument.\n*After '''Leg 7''', Mel & Mike were the sixth team eliminated and were sent to the villa. They noted how the remaining teams on the ''Race'' are becoming more competitive. Afterward, everyone went shopping at a nearby marketplace. Tension continued to grow between Preston & Jennifer when Preston became irritated with her over her buying another purse.\n*'''Leg 8''' was a non-elimination leg, so no new teams were eliminated. Due to their constant arguing, Preston & Jennifer chose to spend some time away from each other. The eliminated teams spent the day [[snorkeling]] and [[kayaking]] at an island.\n*After '''Leg 9''', Mark & Michael were the seventh team eliminated. Before receiving a phone call from the latest team that was eliminated, the eliminated teams at the villa went on a safari, most notably riding an elephant. Afterward, Mark & Michael called the villa to inform the other teams of their elimination and told them of the time penalties that led to their elimination. All teams agreed that they wanted to see Jaime & Cara eliminated next.\n*'''Leg 10''' is a double-length leg, shown over two episodes. A new episode of Elimination Station was posted after each half aired:\n**The first half ended with a Virtual Pit Stop (no elimination). Elimination Station showed the sequestered teams on their last day at the Elimination Station, where the teams discussed their time together and who they wanted to see win the ''Race''. As the eliminated teams packed for their trip to the End City, each of the teams further reminisced about their stay at the Elimination Station.\n**After the second half of the leg, Kisha & Jen were the eighth and final team eliminated. Elimination Station showed the six eliminated teams arriving at the End City in [[Maui, Hawaii]]. After arriving in Maui, the teams checked into a hotel. Once they checked in, they swam and snorkeled at the beach, then returned to the hotel to await a phone call from the eighth team eliminated. The six eliminated teams at the hotel were shocked and disappointed to hear about Kisha & Jen's elimination, especially Preston & Jennifer who wanted them to win. Kisha & Jen told them about what went wrong during the second half of Leg 10 and on the part where they were U-Turned by Tammy & Victor.

Significant towns immediately outside the boundary of the national park include [[Millom]], [[Barrow-in-Furness]], [[Kendal]], [[Ulverston]], Dalton-in-Furness, [[Cockermouth]], [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]], and [[Grange-over-Sands]]; each of these has important economic links with the area.

It is flanked to the east by the [[A6 road (England)|A6 road]] which runs from Kendal to Penrith (though the National Park extension approved in 2015 is east of the A6). The [[A590 road|A590]] which connects the M6 to [[Barrow-in-Furness]], and the [[A5092 road|A5092]] trunk roads cut across its southern fringes and the [[A66 road|A66]] trunk road between Penrith and [[Workington]] cuts across its northern edge. Finally the [[A595 road|A595]] (linking the A66 with the A5092) forms the park boundary from Calder Bridge to Holmrook, then crosses the coastal plain of the park until turning inland at the Whicham Valley.\n\nBesides these, a few [[Great Britain road numbering scheme|A roads]] penetrate the area itself, notably the [[A591]] which runs north-westwards from Kendal to Windermere and then on to Keswick. It continues up the east side of [[Bassenthwaite Lake]]. \"The A591, Grasmere, Lake District\" was short-listed in the 2011 [[Google Street View]] awards in the Most Romantic Street category. The [[A593 road|A593]] and [[A5084 road (Great Britain)#Four-digit roads (50xx)|A5084]] link the Ambleside and Coniston areas with the A590 to the south whilst the [[A592 road|A592]] and [[A5074 road|A5074]] similarly link Windermere with the A590. The A592 also continues northwards from Windermere to [[Ullswater]] and Penrith by way of the [[Kirkstone Pass]].\n\nSome valleys which are not penetrated by A roads are served by [[Great Britain road numbering scheme|B roads]]. The B5289 serves Lorton Vale and [[Buttermere, Cumbria|Buttermere]] and links via the [[Honister Pass]] with [[Borrowdale]]. The [[B5292 road|B5292]] ascends the [[Whinlatter Pass]] from Lorton Vale before dropping down to [[Braithwaite]] near Keswick. The [[B5322 road|B5322]] serves the valley of [[St John's in the Vale]] whilst [[Great Langdale]] is served by the [[B5343 road|B5343]]. Other valleys such as [[Little Langdale]], [[Eskdale, Cumbria|Eskdale]] and [[Duddon Valley|Dunnerdale]] are served by minor roads. The last of these is connected with the first two by the [[Wrynose Pass|Wrynose]] and [[Hardknott Pass|Hardknott]] passes respectively; both of these passes are known for their steep gradients and are together one of the most popular [[Climbing specialist|climbs]] in the United Kingdom for cycling enthusiasts.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Britain's top 10 toughest cycle climbs |last=Warren |first=Simon |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/jul/20/britains-top-10-toughest-cycle-climbs |newspaper=The Guardian |date=20 July 2012 |accessdate=6 September 2012}}</ref> A minor road through the [[Newlands Valley]] connects via [[Newlands Hause]] with the B5289 at Buttermere.

There are networks of minor roads in the lower-lying southern part of the area, connecting numerous communities between Kendal, Windermere and Coniston.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\n==== Railways and ferries ====\nThe [[West Coast Main Line]] skirts the eastern edge of the Lake District and the [[Cumbrian Coast Line]] passes through the southern and western fringes of the area. A single railway line, the [[Windermere Branch Line]], penetrates from Kendal to Windermere via Staveley. Railways once served Broughton-in-Furness and Coniston (closed to passengers in 1958) and another ran from Penrith to Cockermouth via Keswick (closed west of Keswick in 1966 and completely in 1972). Part of the track of the latter is used by the improved A66 trunk road.\n\nThe [[Cumbrian Coast line]] has three stations within the boundaries of the national park (and additionally [[Drigg]], about a third of a mile from the park boundary). The line gives railway enthusiasts and others a flavour of a pre-[[Beeching cuts|Beeching]] railway line, with features like manually operated level crossing gates, as well as giving a good connection to the steam railway into Eskdale and providing access for cyclists and serious walkers to the Western Fells.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.visitcumbria.com/the-cumbrian-coast-railway/|website=Visit Cumbria|accessdate=25 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe narrow gauge [[Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway]] runs from [[Ravenglass]] on the west coast up Eskdale as far as Dalegarth Station near the hamlet of Boot, catering for tourists. Another [[heritage railway]], the [[Lakeside and Haverthwaite Railway]], runs between Lake Windermere and [[Haverthwaite]], and tourists can connect at Lakeside with the boats up the lake to Bowness.\n\nA vehicle-carrying [[cable ferry]], the [[Windermere Ferry]], runs frequent services across Windermere. There are also seasonal passenger boats on Coniston Water, Derwent Water and Ullswater.\n\n==== Footpaths and bridleways ====\nThere are many paths over which the public has a [[Rights of way in England and Wales|right of way]], all of which should be signposted. Within the area of the National Park in 2012 there were {{convert|2159|km|abbr=on}} of [[Public footpath (England and Wales)|public footpaths]],\n{{convert|875|km|abbr=on}} of [[Public bridleway (England and Wales)|public bridleways]],\n{{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}} of [[restricted byway]]s and\n{{convert|30|km|abbr=on}} of [[Byway open to all traffic|byways open to all traffic]].

However the apparent radial pattern is not from a central dome, but from an axial watershed extending west\u2013east from St Bees Head to Shap. Most of these valleys display the U-shaped cross-section characteristic of glacial origin, and often contain elongate lakes occupying sizeable [[bedrock]] hollows, with tracts of relatively flat ground at their infilled heads, or where they are divided by lateral tributaries (Buttermere-Crummock Water; Derwent Water-Bassenthwaite Lake). Smaller lakes known as [[tarn (lake)|tarns]] occupy [[cirque (landform)|glacial cirques]] at higher elevations. It is the abundance of both which has led to the area becoming known as the Lake District. The mountains of the Lake District are also known as the \"Cumbrian Mountains\", although this name is less frequently used than terms like \"the Lake District\" or \"the Lakeland Fells\". As the highest ground in England, [[Scafell Pike]] (978m/3210') naturally has a very extensive view on a clear day, ranging from the Galloway Hills of Scotland to the [[Mourne Mountains]] in Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man, and [[Snowdonia]] in Wales.\n{{wide image|Annotated Scafel Pike Panorama.jpg|3000px|A panorama from the summit of Scafell Pike, August 2007}}\n\nMany of the higher [[fell]]s are rocky, while [[moorland]] predominates at lower altitudes. Vegetation cover across better drained areas includes [[bracken]] and [[Calluna|heather]], though much of the land is [[bog]]gy, due to the high rainfall. Deciduous native woodland occurs on many of the  steeper slopes below the [[tree line]], but with native oak supplemented by extensive conifer plantations in many areas, particularly [[Grizedale Forest]] in the generally lower southern part of the area.  The Lake District extends to the sea to the west and south.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bing.com/maps/sharing|title=Maps|website=www.bing.com|accessdate=19 August 2019}}</ref>\n{{wide image|Wasdale screes.jpg|1000px|Panorama of the Wasdale screes descending into [[Wastwater]], the deepest lake in England.}}\n\n=== Valleys ===\n[[File:The Tongue Valley (looking from Dollywaggon Pike), near Troutbeck, Cumbria, at the Lake District National Park, United Kingdom, Europe (November 2008).jpg|thumb|The Tongue Valley (looking from ''Dollywaggon Pike'')]]\nThe principal radial valleys are (clockwise from the south) [[Dunnerdale]], [[Eskdale, Cumbria|Eskdale]], [[Wasdale]], [[Ennerdale Water|Ennerdale]], the Vale of Lorton and [[Buttermere]] valley, the [[River Derwent, Cumbria|Derwent Valley]] and [[Borrowdale]], the Ullswater valley, Haweswater valley, [[Longsleddale]], the [[Kentmere]] valley, those converging on the head of Windermere - Grasmere, [[Great Langdale]] and Little Langdale, and the Coniston Water valley. The valleys break the mountains up into separate blocks, which have been described by various authors in different ways. The most frequently encountered approach is that made popular by [[Alfred Wainwright]] who published seven separate area guides to the Lakeland Fells.\n\n=== Woodlands ===\nBelow the [[tree line]] are wooded areas, including British and European native [[oak]] woodlands and introduced softwood plantations. The woodlands provide habitats for native English wildlife. The native [[red squirrel]] is found in the Lake District and in a few other parts of England. In parts of the Lake District the rainfall is higher than in any other part of England. This gives [[Atlantic]] [[moss]]es, [[fern]]s, [[lichen]], and [[liverwort]]s the chance to grow. There is some [[ancient woodland]] in the National Park. Management of the woodlands varies: some are [[coppice]]d, some [[pollarding|pollarded]], some left to grow naturally, and some provide grazing and shelter.\n\n=== Fells (hills) ===\n[[File:Scafell massif.jpg|thumb|The impressive bulk of the [[Scafell]] massif, the highest ground in England, seen over [[Wasdale]].]]\n{{location map+|United Kingdom Lake District|relief=1|width=300|maplink=|float=|caption={{center|'''Some major fells and towns'''}}|places=\n<!-- Fells -->\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label='''[[Scafell Pike]]'''\n|label_size=100|mark=Montanya.svg|link=|marksize=16|position=right\n|lat=54.454222|long=-3.211528}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label='''[[Scafell]]'''\n|label_size=100|mark=Montanya.svg|link=|marksize=12|position=left\n|lat=54.448|long=-3.225}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label='''[[Scafell]]'''\n|label_size=100|mark=Montanya.svg|link=|marksize=12|position=left\n|lat=54.448|long=-3.225}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label='''[[Helvellyn]]'''\n|label_size=100|mark=Montanya.svg|link=|marksize=12|position=left\n|lat=54.527|long=-3.016}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label='''[[Skiddaw]]'''\n|label_size=100|mark=Montanya.svg|link=|marksize=12|position=right\n|lat=54.647|long=-3.146}}\n<!-- High Raise gets in the way and isn't very high\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[High Raise (Langdale)|Raise]]\n|label_size=100|mark=Blue Fire.svg|link=|marksize=9|position=right\n|lat=54.476|long=-3.113}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[High Raise (Langdale)|High]]\n|label_size=100|mark=Blue Fire.svg|link=|marksize=9|position=left\n|lat=54.476|long=-3.113}}-->\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[High Street (Lake District)|High Street]]\n|label_size=100|mark=Blue Fire.svg|link=|marksize=9|position=right\n|lat=54.492|long=-2.865}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Grasmoor]]\n|label_size=100|mark=Blue Fire.svg|link=|marksize=9|position=left\n|lat=54.571|long=-3.279}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Coniston Old Man]]\n|label_size=100|mark=Blue Fire.svg|link=|marksize=9|position=left\n|lat=54.37|long=-3.119}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Great Gable]]\n|label_size=100|mark=Blue Fire.svg|link=|marksize=9|position=left\n|lat=54.482|long=-3.219}}\n<!-- Places -->\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label={{font color|green|Kendal}}|label_size=|mark=Location dot green.svg|link=|marksize=6|position=right|lat=54.326|long=-2.745}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label={{font color|green|Penrith}}|label_size=|mark=Location dot green.svg|link=|marksize=6|position=right|lat=54.6648|long=-2.7548}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label={{font color|green|Keswick}}|label_size=|mark=Location dot green.svg|link=|marksize=6|position=right|lat=54.59|long=-3.14}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label={{font color|green|Ambleside}}|label_size=|mark=Location dot green.svg|link=|marksize=6|position=right|lat=54.4251|long=-2.9626}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label={{font color|green|Cockermouth}}|label_size=|mark=Location dot green.svg|link=|marksize=6|position=left|lat=54.6613|long=-3.362}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label={{font color|green|Windermere}}|label_size=|mark=Location dot green.svg|link=|marksize=6|position=right|lat=54.376|long=-2.907}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label={{font color|green|Grasmere}}|label_size=|mark=Location dot green.svg|link=|marksize=6|position=top|lat=54.45809|long=-3.02459}}\n}}\n{{See also|list of fells in the Lake District|list of hills in the Lake District}}\nThe four highest mountains in the Lake District exceed {{convert|3000|ft|m|0}}.

They culminate in the {{convert|931|m|ft|abbr=on}} peak of [[Skiddaw]]. Other notable peaks are [[Blencathra]] (also known as Saddleback) ({{convert|868|m|ft|abbr=on}}) and [[Carrock Fell]]. [[Bassenthwaite Lake]] occupies the valley between this massif and the North Western Fells.\n\n==== North Western Fells ====\nThe [[North Western Fells]] lie between [[Borrowdale]] and Bassenthwaite Lake to the east and [[Buttermere]] and [[Lorton Vale]] to the west. Their southernmost point is at [[Honister Pass]]. This area includes the Derwent Fells above the [[Newlands Valley]] and hills to the north amongst which are [[Dale Head]], [[Robinson (Lake District)|Robinson]]. To the north stand [[Grasmoor]], highest in the range at {{convert|852|m|ft|abbr=on}}, [[Grisedale Pike]] and the hills around the valley of [[Coledale (Cumbria)|Coledale]], and in the far north west is Thornthwaite Forest and [[Lord's Seat]]. The fells in this area are rounded [[Skiddaw slate]], with few tarns and relatively few rock faces.\n\n==== Western Fells ====\n[[File:Westmorland cairn Great Gable.jpg|thumb|The view towards [[Wast Water]] from the cairn built by the Westmorland brothers in 1876 to the SW of the summit of [[Great Gable]], which they considered the finest view in the district.]]\nThe [[Western Fells]] lie between Buttermere and [[Wasdale]], with [[Sty Head]] forming the apex of a large triangle. [[Ennerdale Water|Ennerdale]] bisects the area, which consists of the [[High Stile]] ridge north of Ennerdale, the [[Loweswater Fells]] in the far north west, the [[Pillar (Lake District)|Pillar]] group in the south west, and [[Great Gable]] ({{convert|2949|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}}) near Sty Head. Other tops include [[Seatallan]], [[Haystacks (Lake District)|Haystacks]] and [[Kirk Fell]]. This area is craggy and steep, with the impressive pinnacle of Pillar Rock its showpiece. [[Wastwater]], located in this part, is England's deepest lake.\n\n==== Central Fells ====\nThe [[Central Fells]] are lower in elevation than surrounding areas of fell, peaking at {{convert|762|m|ft|abbr=on}} at [[High Raise, Langdale|High Raise]]. They take the form of a ridge running between [[Derwent Water]] in the west and [[Thirlmere]] in the east, from [[Keswick, Cumbria|Keswick]] in the north to [[Langdale Pikes]] in the south. A spur extends south east to [[Loughrigg Fell]] above [[Ambleside]]. The central ridge running north over [[High Seat, Lake District|High Seat]] is exceptionally boggy.\n\n==== Eastern Fells ====\n[[File:Glenridding, Cumbria, England - June 2009.jpg|thumb|The village of [[Glenridding]] and [[Ullswater]] lake]]\nThe [[Eastern Fells]] consist of a long north-to-south [[ridge]], the [[Helvellyn range]], running from [[Clough Head]] to [[Seat Sandal]] with the {{convert|3118|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} [[Helvellyn]] at its highest point. The western slopes of these summits tend to be grassy, with rocky [[Cirque|corries]] and [[cliff|crags]] on the eastern side. The [[Fairfield (Lake District)|Fairfield]] group lies to the south of the range, and forms a similar pattern with towering rock faces and hidden valleys spilling into the [[Patterdale]] valley. It culminates in the height of [[Red Screes]] overlooking the [[Kirkstone Pass]].\n\n==== Far Eastern Fells ====\n[[File:Haweswater from Harter Fell 3.jpg|thumb|[[Haweswater Reservoir]] from [[Harter Fell (Mardale)|Harter Fell]]]]\nThe [[Far Eastern Fells]] refer to all of the Lakeland fells to the east of Ullswater and the A592 road running south to Windermere. At {{convert|828|m|ft|abbr=on}}, the peak known as [[High Street (Lake District)|High Street]] is the highest point on a complex ridge which runs broadly north\u2013south and overlooks the hidden valley of [[Haweswater Reservoir|Haweswater]] to its east. In the north of this region are the lower fells of Martindale Common and Bampton Common whilst in the south are the fells overlooking the [[Kentmere]] valley. Further to the east, beyond [[Mardale]] and [[Longsleddale]] is [[Shap]] Fell, an extensive area consisting of high [[moorland]], more rolling and [[Pennines|Pennine]] in nature than the mountains to the west.\n\n==== Southern Fells ====\n[[File:Coniston Water from Holme Fell.jpg|thumb|right|[[Coniston Water]] from [[Holme Fell]]]]\nThe [[Southern Fells]] occupy the southwestern quarter of the Lake District. They can be regarded as comprising a northern grouping between Wasdale, Eskdale and the two Langdale valleys, a southeastern group east of Dunnerdale and south of Little Langdale and a southwestern group bounded by Eskdale to the north and Dunnerdale to the east.\n\nThe first group includes England's highest mountains: [[Scafell Pike]] in the centre, at {{convert|3209|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} and [[Scafell]] {{convert|1|mi|spell=in}} to the southwest. Though it is slightly lower it has a {{convert|700|ft|m|-1|abbr=on}} rockface, Scafell Crag, on its northern side. It also includes the [[Wastwater Screes]] overlooking Wasdale, the [[Glaramara]] ridge overlooking Borrowdale, the three tops of [[Crinkle Crags]], [[Bowfell]] and [[Esk Pike]]. The core of the area is drained by the infant [[River Esk, Cumbria|River Esk]]. Collectively these are some of the Lake District's most rugged hillsides.\n\nThe second group, otherwise known as the [[Furness Fells]] or Coniston Fells, have as their northern boundary the steep and narrow  [[Hardknott Pass|Hardknott]] and [[Wrynose Pass|Wrynose]] passes. The highest are [[Old Man of Coniston]] and [[Swirl How]] which slightly exceed {{convert|800|m|-2|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe third group to the west of the Duddon includes [[Harter Fell, Eskdale|Harter Fell]] and the long ridge leading over [[Whitfell]] to [[Black Combe]] and the sea. The south of this region consists of lower forests and knolls, with [[Kirkby Moor]] on the southern boundary. The southwestern Lake District ends near the [[Furness]] peninsula and [[Barrow-in-Furness]], a town which many Lake District residents rely on for basic amenities.\n\n==== Southeastern area ====\nThe southeastern area is the territory between [[Coniston Water]] and [[Windermere]] and east of Windermere towards Kendal and south to Lindale. There are no high summits in this area which is mainly low hills, knolls and limestone [[cuesta]]s such as [[Gummer's How]] and [[Whitbarrow]]. Indeed, it rises only as high as {{convert|333|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} at [[Top o' Selside]] east of Coniston Water; the wide expanse of [[Grizedale Forest]] stands between the two lakes. [[Kendal]] and [[Morecambe Bay]] stand at the eastern and southern edges of the area.\n\n=== Lakes ===\n{{Wide image|Derwent Water, Keswick - June 2009.jpg|1200px|Derwent Water, one of 21 large water bodies in the Lake District}}\n{{See also|List of lakes in the Lake District}}\n{{location map+|United Kingdom Lake District|relief=1|width=300|maplink=|float=|caption={{center|'''Major lakes'''}}|places=\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Bassenthwaite Lake|Bassenthwaite]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=right|lat=54.65|long=-3.216667}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Brothers Water|Brotherswater]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=bottom|lat=54.505556|long=-2.925}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Buttermere|Butter-<br />mere]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=right|lat=54.533333|long=-3.266667}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Coniston Water|Coniston]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=left|lat=54.335|long=-3.08}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Crummock Water|Crummock]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=left|lat=54.56|long=-3.308}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Derwent Water|Derwent<br />Water]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=right|lat=54.574|long=-3.145}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Elter Water|Elterwater]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=left|lat=54.427469|long=-3.025875}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Ennerdale Water|Ennerdale]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=left|lat=54.52|long=-3.376111}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Esthwaite Water|Esthwaite]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=right|lat=54.359|long=-2.99}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Grasmere (lake)|Grasmere]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=left|lat=54.448834|long=-3.020897}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Haweswater Reservoir|Hawes-<br />water]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=right|lat=54.518889|long=-2.804722}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Loweswater]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=left|lat=54.5825|long=-3.355278}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Rydal Water]]'''|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=right|lat=54.446944|long=-2.996389}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Thirlmere]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=right|lat=54.533333|long=-3.066667}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Ullswater]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=right|lat=54.5775|long=-2.8751}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Wastwater]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=left|lat=54.441667|long=-3.291667}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Windermere]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=right|lat=54.390|long=-2.944}}\n}}\nOnly one of the lakes in the Lake District is called by that name, [[Bassenthwaite Lake]].

The intertidal zone of the combined estuaries includes sand, shingle and mudflats and [[saltmarsh]]. The dune systems on either side of the estuary are protected as nature reserves; Drigg Dunes and Gullery<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cwr.defra.gov.uk/default.aspx?Site=6167|title=Defra, UK - Rural Affairs|website=cwr.defra.gov.uk|accessdate=19 August 2019}}</ref> to the north and Eskmeals Dunes<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cumbriawildlifetrust.org.uk/nature-reserves/eskmeals-dunes|title=Eskmeals Dunes &#124; Cumbria Wildlife Trust|website=www.cumbriawildlifetrust.org.uk|accessdate=19 August 2019}}</ref> to the south. South of the estuary the coast is formed in low cliffs of glacial [[till]], sands and gravels.<ref>http://mapapps2.bgs.ac.uk/geoindex/home.html  BGS Geoindex Onshore</ref>\n\nThe district also extends to the tidal waters of [[Morecambe Bay]] and several of its estuaries alongside the [[Furness Peninsula|Furness]] and [[Cartmel Peninsula]]s, designated on M6 motorway signposts as the \"Lake District Peninsulas\", and the southern portions of which lie outside the park. These are the [[Duddon Estuary]], the [[River Leven, Cumbria|Leven Estuary]], and the western banks and tidal flats of the [[River Kent#Lower river|Kent Estuary]]. These areas are each characterised by sand and mudflats of scenic and wildlife interest. The coast is backed by extensive flats of raised marine deposits left when relative sea level was higher.\n\n== Geology ==\n{{main|Geology of the Lake District}}\n[[File:Lake District Geology Map.svg|thumb|Geological map of the Lake District showing the main structures and areas of mineralisation]]\n[[File:Skiddaw (cropped).JPG|thumb|Skiddaw seen from Derwentwater]]\nThe Lake District's geology is very complex but well-studied.<ref name=\"Gannon, Rock Trails Lakeland\">Gannon, ''Rock Trails Lakeland''</ref> A [[granite]] [[batholith]] beneath the area is responsible for this upland massif, its relatively low density causing the area to be \"buoyed up\". The granite can be seen at the surface as the Ennerdale, Skiddaw, Carrock Fell, Eskdale and Shap granites.\n\nBroadly speaking the area can be divided into three bands, the divisions between which run south west to north east. Generally speaking the rocks become younger from north west to south east. The north western band is composed of early to mid-[[Ordovician]] [[sedimentary rock]]s, largely [[mudstone]]s and [[siltstone]]s of marine origin. Together they comprise the [[Skiddaw Group]] and include the rocks traditionally known as the [[Skiddaw Slate]]s. Their [[friability]] generally leads to mountains with relatively smooth slopes such as Skiddaw itself.\n\nThe central band is a mix of [[volcanic]] and sedimentary rocks of mid-to-late Ordovician age comprising the [[lava]]s and [[tuff]]s of the [[Borrowdale Volcanic Group]], erupted as the former [[Iapetus Ocean]] was [[subduction|subducted]] beneath what is now the Scottish border during the [[Caledonian orogeny]]. The northern central peaks, such as Great Rigg, were produced by considerable lava flows. These lava eruptions were followed by a series of [[Pyroclastic flow|pyroclastic]] eruptions which produced a series of calderas, one of which includes present-day Scafell Pike. These pyroclastic rocks give rise to the craggy landscapes typical of the central fells.<ref name=\"Gannon, Rock Trails Lakeland\"/>\n\nThe south eastern band comprises the mudstones and [[wacke]]s of the [[Windermere Supergroup]] and which includes (successively) the rocks of the Dent, Stockdale, Tranearth, Coniston and Kendal groups. These are generally a little less resistant to erosion than the rocks sequence to the north and underlie much of the lower landscapes around Coniston and Windermere.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nLater [[intrusion]]s have formed individual outcrops of [[igneous rock]] in each of these groups.\nAround the edges of these Ordovician and Silurian rocks on the northern, eastern and southern fringes of the area is a semi-continuous outcrop of [[Carboniferous Limestone]] seen most spectacularly at places like [[Whitbarrow Scar]] and [[Scout Scar]].\n<ref>British Geological Survey Regional memoir ''Northern England'' 5th edn 2010</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lakedistrict.gov.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/171188/factsheet_geology.pdf|title=Geology Factsheet|publisher=Lake District National Park Authority Web|date=May 24, 2017|accessdate=December 2, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Climate ==\nThe Lake District's location on the northwest coast of England, coupled with its mountainous geography, makes it the wettest part of England. The UK [[Met Office]] reports average annual [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] of more than {{convert|2000|mm|in|-1|abbr=on}}, but with very large local variation.\n\nAlthough the entire region receives above average rainfall, there is a wide disparity between the amount of rainfall in the western and eastern lakes, as the Lake District experiences [[relief rainfall]]. [[Seathwaite, Allerdale|Seathwaite, Borrowdale]] is the wettest inhabited place in England with an average of {{convert|3300|mm|in|-1|abbr=on}} of rain a year,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/nw|title=UK regional climates|work=Met Office|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605003213/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/nw|archivedate=5 June 2011}}</ref> while nearby [[Sprinkling Tarn]] is even wetter, recording over {{convert|5000|mm|in|-1|abbr=on}} per year;<ref>{{cite web |last1=Visit Cumbria |title=Lake District weather |url=https://www.visitcumbria.com/lake-district-weather/ |website=visitcumbria.com |accessdate=17 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Lake District Weatherline |title=Overview of weather |url=https://www.lakedistrictweatherline.co.uk/ |website=Lake District Weatherline |accessdate=17 October 2019}}</ref> by contrast, Keswick, at the end of [[Borrowdale]] receives {{convert|1470|mm|in|abbr=on}} every year, and [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]] (just outside the Lake District) only {{convert|870|mm|in|abbr=on}}. March to June tend to be the driest months, with October to January the wettest, but at low levels there is relatively little difference between months.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nAlthough sheltered valleys experience [[gale]]s on an average of only five days a year, the Lake District is generally very windy with the coastal areas having 20 days of gales, and the fell tops around 100 days of gales per year. The maritime climate means that the Lake District experiences relatively moderate temperature variations through the year. Mean temperature in the valleys ranges from about {{convert|3|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}} in January to around {{convert|15|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}} in July. (By comparison, [[Moscow]], at the same latitude, ranges from {{convert|-10|to|19|C|F|abbr=on}}.)\n\nThe relatively low height of most of the fells means that, while snow is expected during the winter, they can be free of snow at any time of the year. Normally, significant snow fall only occurs between November and April. On average, snow falls on [[Helvellyn]] 67 days per year. During the year, valleys typically experience 20 days with snow falling, a further 200 wet days, and 145 dry days. Hill fog is common at any time of year, and the fells average only around 2.5 hours of sunshine per day, increasing to around 4.1 hours per day on the coastal plains.\n{{Weather box <!-- Infobox begins -->\n|collapsed=    <!-- Any entry in this line will make the template initially collapsed.

In 2002, the [[Environment Agency]] introduced a new fisheries byelaw, banning the use of all freshwater fish as live or dead bait in 14 of the lakes in the Lake District. Anglers not complying with the new byelaw can face fines of up to \u00a32,500. There are 14 lakes in the Lake District which are affected. These are: Bassenthwaite Lake, Brothers Water, Buttermere, Coniston Water, Crummock Water, Derwent Water, Ennerdale Water, Haweswater, Loweswater, Red Tarn, Thirlmere, Ullswater, Wast Water and Windermere.\n\nThe lakes and waters of the Lake District do not naturally support as many species of fish as other similar habitats in the south of the country and elsewhere in Europe. Some fish that do thrive there are particularly at risk from introduction of new species.\n\nThe introduction of non-native fish can lead to the predation of the native fish fauna or competition for food. There is also the risk of disease being introduced, which can further threaten native populations. In some cases, the introduced species can disturb the environment so much that it becomes unsuitable for particular fish. For example, a major problem has been found with [[ruffe]]. This non-native fish has now been introduced into a number of lakes in recent years. It is known that ruffe eat the eggs of vendace, which are particularly vulnerable because of their long incubation period. This means that they are susceptible to predators for up to 120 days. The eggs of other fish, for example [[Rutilus|roach]], are only at risk for as little as three days.\n\n== Economy ==\n\n=== Agriculture and forestry ===\n[[File:Forestry on Harter Fell.jpg|thumb|Forestry operations on [[Harter Fell, Eskdale|Harter Fell]]]]\n\nFarming, and in particular [[Domestic sheep|sheep farming]], has been the major industry in the region since [[Roman Britain|Roman]] times. The breed most closely associated with the area is the tough [[Herdwick]], with [[Rough Fell]] and [[Swaledale (sheep)|Swaledale]] sheep also common. Sheep farming remains important both for the economy of the region and for preserving the landscape which visitors want to see. Features such as [[dry stone wall]]s, for example, are there as a result of sheep farming. Some land is also used for [[silage]] and [[dairy farming]].\n\nThe area was badly affected by the outbreak of [[foot-and-mouth disease]] across the United Kingdom in 2001. The outbreak started in [[Surrey]] in February, but had spread to [[Cumbria]] by end of March.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Lake District 'nightmare' as fell farm is infected |last=Cadwalladr |first=Carole |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1327961/Lake-District-nightmare-as-fell-farm-is-infected.html |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=26 March 2001 |accessdate=27 August 2012}}</ref> Thousands of sheep, including the native [[Herdwick]]s which graze on the fellsides across the district, were destroyed.

There are extensive plantations of non-native pine trees.\n\n=== Industry ===\nWith its wealth of rock types and their abundance in the landscape, mining and quarrying have long been significant activities in the Lake District economy. In [[Neolithic]] times, the Lake District was a major source of stone [[axe]]s, examples of which have been found all over Britain. The primary site, on the slopes of the Langdale Pikes, is sometimes described as a \"stone axe factory\" of the [[Langdale axe industry]]. Some of the earliest [[stone circle]]s in Britain are connected with this industry.\n\nMining, particularly of copper, lead (often associated with quantities of silver), [[baryte]], [[graphite]] and [[slate]], was historically a major Lakeland industry, mainly from the 16th to 19th centuries. Coppiced woodland was used extensively to provide [[charcoal]] for smelting. Some mining still takes place today; for example, slate mining continues at the [[Honister Slate Mine|Honister Mines]], at the top of [[Honister Pass]]. Abandoned mine workings can be found on fellsides throughout the district. The locally mined graphite led to the development of the [[pencil]] industry, especially around [[Keswick, Cumbria|Keswick]].\n\n[[File:Lake District near Torver.jpg|thumb|A typical Lake District scene]]\n\nIn the middle of the 19th century, half the world textile industry's [[bobbin]] supply came from the Lake District area. Over the past century, however, tourism has grown rapidly to become the area's primary source of income.\n\n=== Development of tourism ===\n{{More citations needed|date=September 2011}}\nEarly visitors to the Lake District, who travelled for the education and pleasure of the journey, include [[Celia Fiennes]] who in 1698 undertook a journey the length of England, including riding through [[Kendal]] and over [[Kirkstone Pass]] into [[Patterdale]]. Her experiences and impressions were published in her book ''Great Journey to Newcastle and Cornwall'':\n\n<blockquote>As I walked down at this place I was walled on both sides by those inaccessible high rocky barren hills which hang over one\u2019s head in some places and appear very terrible; and from them springs many little currents of water from the sides and clefts which trickle down to some lower part where it runs swiftly over the stones and shelves in the way, which makes a pleasant rush and murmuring noise and like a snowball is increased by each spring trickling down on either side of those hills, and so descends into the bottoms which are a Moorish ground in which in many places the waters stand, and so form some of those Lakes as it did here.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=81JxDbc2KeIC&pg=PA183&dq=descends+into+the+bottoms+which+are+a+Moorish+ground&hl=en&ei=phdrTvmvHI_sOdbgrdcF&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=descends%20into%20the%20bottoms%20which%20are%20a%20Moorish%20ground&f=false An Anthology of Women's Travel Writing \u2013 Google Books].

He commented on [[Westmorland]] that it was:\n\n<blockquote>the wildest, most barren and frightful of any that I have passed over in England, or even Wales itself; the west side, which borders on Cumberland, is indeed bounded by a chain of almost unpassable mountains which, in the language of the country, are called fells.</blockquote>\n\nTowards the end of the 18th century, the area was becoming more popular with travellers. This was partly a result of wars in [[Continental Europe]], restricting the possibility of travel there. In 1778 [[Thomas West (priest)|Thomas West]] produced ''A Guide to the Lakes'', which began the era of modern tourism.\n\n[[File:Claife Station.jpg|thumb|Claife Station on the western shore of [[Windermere]]]]\nWest listed \"stations\", viewpoints where tourists could enjoy the best views of the landscape, being encouraged to appreciate the formal qualities of the landscape and to apply aesthetic values. At some of these stations, buildings were erected to help this process. The remains of Claife Station (on the western shore [[Windermere]] below [[Claife Heights]]) can be visited today.\n\n[[William Wordsworth]] published his ''Guide to the Lakes'' in 1810, and by 1835 it had reached its fifth edition, now called ''A Guide Through the District of the Lakes in the North of England''. This book was particularly influential in popularising the region. Wordsworth's favourite valley was Dunnerdale or the [[Duddon Valley]] nestling in the south west of the Lake District.\n\nThe railways led to another expansion in tourism. The [[Kendal and Windermere Railway]] was the first to penetrate the Lake District, reaching [[Kendal]] in 1846 and [[Windermere, Cumbria (town)|Windermere]] in 1847. The line to [[Coniston, Cumbria|Coniston]] opened in 1848 (although until 1857 this was only linked to the national network with ferries between [[Fleetwood]] and [[Barrow-in-Furness]]); the line from [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]] through [[Keswick, Cumbria|Keswick]] to [[Cockermouth]] in 1865; and the line to [[Lakeside, Cumbria|Lakeside]] at the foot of [[Windermere]] in 1869. The railways, built with traditional industry in mind, brought with them a huge increase in the number of visitors, thus contributing to the growth of the tourism industry. Railway services were supplemented by steamer boats on the major lakes of [[Ullswater]], Windermere, [[Coniston Water]], and [[Derwent Water]].\n\n[[File:STEAMER ON ULLSWATER.jpg|thumb|A steamer on [[Ullswater]]]]\n\nThe growth in tourist numbers continued into the age of the motor car, when railways began to be closed or run down. The formation of the [[Lake District National Park]] in 1951 recognised the need to protect the Lake District environment from excessive commercial or industrial exploitation, preserving that which visitors come to see, without any restriction on the movement of people into and around the district. The [[M6 Motorway]] helped bring traffic to the Lake District, passing up its eastern flank. The narrow roads present a challenge for traffic flow and, from the 1960s, certain areas have been very congested.\n\nWhilst the roads and railways provided easier access to the area, many people were drawn to Lakeland by the publication of the ''[[Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells]]'' by [[Alfred Wainwright]]. First published between 1955 and 1966, these books provided detailed information on 214 fells across the region, with carefully hand-drawn maps and panoramas, and also stories and asides which add to the colour of the area. They are still used by many visitors to the area as guides for walking excursions, with the ultimate goal of [[Peak bagging|bagging]] the complete list of ''[[List of Wainwrights|Wainwrights]]''. The famous guides were revised by [[Chris Jesty]] between 2005 and 2009 to reflect changes, mainly in valley access and paths, and are currently being revised by Clive Hutchby, the author of The Wainwright Companion. The first of the revised volumes, Book One: The Eastern Fells, was published in March 2015; the most recent, Book Six: The North Western Fells, was published in April 2019.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jun/13/books.ruralaffairs | work=The Guardian | first=Martin | last=Wainwright | title=Famed fells guides join the 21st century | date=13 June 2005}}</ref>\n\nSince the early 1960s, the National Park Authority has employed rangers to help cope with increasing tourism and development, the first being [[John Wyatt (writer)|John Wyatt]], who has since written a number of guide books. He was joined two years later by a second, and since then the number of rangers has been rising.\n\nThe area has also become associated with writer [[Beatrix Potter]]. A number of tourists visit to see her family home, with particularly large numbers coming from Japan.\n\nTourism has now become the park's major industry, with about 12&nbsp;million visitors each year, mainly from the UK's larger settlements, China, Japan, Spain, Germany and the US.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/holiday/destinations/lake_district_cartmel |title=Desintations: Lake District |publisher=BBC\\ |date=27 January 2005 |archivedate=27 January 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050127144348/http://www.bbc.co.uk/holiday/destinations/lake_district_cartmel/ }}</ref> Windermere Lake Steamers are Cumbria's most popular charging tourist attraction with about 1.35&nbsp;million paying customers each year, and the local economy is dependent upon tourists. The negative impact of tourism has been seen, however. [[Soil erosion]], caused by walking, is now a significant problem, with millions of pounds being spent to protect overused paths. In 2006, two [[Visitor center|tourist information centres]] in the National Park were closed.\n\nCycling is now popular in the Lake District National Park.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lakedistrict.gov.uk/visiting/things-to-do/cycling|title=Lake District cycling|date=2017-04-25|website=Lake District National Park|language=en|access-date=2019-05-29}}</ref> A number of long-distance cycle routes go through the Lake District, including coast to coast cycle routes such as the [[Coast to Coast Cycle Route|C2C]], Hadrian's Cycleway, the Reivers Route and the Walney to Wear route. Several towns have also become hubs for road-cycling holidays and cycle touring, such as [[Keswick, Cumbria|Keswick]] and [[Ambleside]]. Mountain bikers use the trails constructed at Whinlatter Forest<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forestryengland.uk/whinlatter/cycling-and-mountain-biking-trails-whinlatter|title=Cycling and mountain biking trails at Whinlatter|website=Forestry England|language=en|access-date=2019-05-29}}</ref> and Grizedale Forest and also have wilder routes available on bridleways.\n\nCultural tourism is becoming an increasingly important part of the wider tourist industry. The Lake District's links with a wealth of artists and writers and its strong history of providing summer theatre performances in the old Blue Box of Century Theatre are strong attractions for visiting tourists. The tradition of theatre is carried on by venues such as [[Theatre by the Lake]] in Keswick with its summer season of six plays in [[repertoire (theatre)|repertoire]], Christmas and Easter productions, and the many literature, film, mountaineering, jazz and creative arts festivals, such as the [[Kendal Mountain Festival]] and the [[Keswick Mountain Festival]].\n\n=== Gastronomy ===\nExcellent mutton and lamb has been produced locally for generations and traditionally formed the basis of the region's many rustic dishes, such as Tatie Pot, a potato-topped mutton casserole.

[[Thomas Gray]] was the first to bring the region to attention, when he wrote a journal of his [[Grand Tour]] in 1769, but it was [[William Wordsworth]] whose poems were most famous and influential. Wordsworth's poem \"[[I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud]]\", inspired by the sight of [[daffodils]] on the shores of Ullswater, remains one of the most famous in the English language. Out of his long life of eighty years, sixty were spent amid its lakes and mountains, first as a schoolboy at [[Hawkshead]], and afterwards living in [[Grasmere (village)|Grasmere]] (1799\u20131813) and [[Rydal Mount]] (1813\u201350). Wordsworth, [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]] and [[Robert Southey|Southey]] became known as the [[Lake Poets]].\n\nThe poet and his wife lie buried in the churchyard of Grasmere and very near to them are the remains of [[Hartley Coleridge]] (son of the poet [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]), who himself lived for many years in Keswick, Ambleside and Grasmere. [[Robert Southey]], the [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]] and friend of Wordsworth (who would succeed Southey as Laureate in 1843), was a resident of Keswick for forty years (1803\u201343), and was buried in [[St Kentigern's Church, Crosthwaite|Crosthwaite churchyard]]. Samuel Taylor Coleridge lived for some time in Keswick, and also with the Wordsworths at Grasmere. From 1807 to 1815 [[John Wilson (Scottish writer)|John Wilson]] lived at Windermere. [[Thomas de Quincey]] spent the greater part of the years 1809 to 1828 at Grasmere, in the first cottage which Wordsworth had inhabited. Ambleside, or its environs, was also the place of residence both of [[Thomas Arnold]], who spent there the vacations of the last ten years of his life and of [[Harriet Martineau]], who built herself a house there in 1845. At Keswick, Mrs Lynn Linton (wife of [[William James Linton]]) was born, in 1822. [[Brantwood]], a house beside Coniston Water, was the home of [[John Ruskin]] during the last years of his life. His assistant [[W. G. Collingwood]] the author, artist and antiquarian lived nearby, and wrote ''Thorstein of the Mere,'' set in the Norse period.\n\nIn addition to these residents or natives of the Lake District, a variety of other poets and writers made visits to the Lake District or were bound by ties of friendship with those already mentioned above. These include [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], [[Sir Walter Scott]], [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], [[Arthur Hugh Clough]], [[Henry Crabb Robinson]], [[Richard Sharp (politician)|\"Conversation\" Sharp]], [[Thomas Carlyle]], [[John Keats]], [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Lord Tennyson]], [[Matthew Arnold]], [[Felicia Hemans]] and [[Gerald Massey]].\n\nAlthough it is unlikely she ever went there, [[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]] produced no less than sixteen poems on subjects within the Lake District and its surroundings, all associated with engravings within Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Books, from 1832 to 1838. Also included there (1834) is ''Grasmere Lake (A Sketch by a Cockney)'', a skit on becoming a 'lakes poet'.\n\nThe English composer Sir [[Arthur Somervell]] (1863 \u2013 1937) was born in Windermere.\n \nDuring the early 20th century, the children's author [[Beatrix Potter]] was in residence at [[Hill Top, Cumbria|Hill Top]] Farm, setting many of her famous [[Peter Rabbit]] books in the Lake District. Her life was made into a [[Miss Potter|biopic film]], starring [[Ren\u00e9e Zellweger]] and [[Ewan McGregor]]. [[Arthur Ransome]] lived in several areas of the Lake District, and set five of his [[Swallows and Amazons series]] of books, published between 1930 and 1947, in a fictionalised Lake District setting. So did [[Geoffrey Trease]] with his five Black Banner school stories (1949\u201356), starting with ''[[No Boats on Bannermere]]''.\n\nThe novelist [[Hugh Walpole|Sir Hugh Walpole]] lived at \"Brackenburn\" on the lower slopes of [[Catbells]] overlooking Derwent Water from 1924 until his death in 1941. Whilst living at \"Brackenburn\" he wrote ''The Herries Chronicle'' detailing the history of a fictional Cumbrian family over two centuries. The noted author and poet [[Norman Nicholson]] came from the south west lakes, living and writing about [[Millom]] in the 20th century \u2013 he was known as the last of the [[Lake Poets]] and came close to becoming the Poet Laureate.\n\nThe Lakes has been an inspirations for many notable artists. Some of the most famous artists to depict the region in their work have been [[Alfred Heaton Cooper]] and [[William Heaton Cooper]].\n\nWriter and author [[Melvyn Bragg]] was brought up in the region and has used it as the setting for some of his work, such as his novel ''A Time to Dance'', later turned into a television drama.\n\nThe Lake District has been the setting for crime novels by [[Reginald Hill]], [[Val McDermid]] and [[Martin Edwards (author)|Martin Edwards]]. The region is also a recurring theme in [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s 1926 novella ''[[The Torrents of Spring]]'' and features prominently in [[Ian McEwan]]'s ''[[Amsterdam (novel)|Amsterdam]]'', which won the 1998 [[Booker Prize]]. The 1996 [[Eisner Award]] winning graphic novel [[The Tale of One Bad Rat]] by [[Bryan Talbot]] featured a young girl's journey to and subsequent stay in the Lake District.\n\nThe Lake District is mentioned in [[Jane Austen]]'s ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]''; [[Elizabeth Bennet]] looks forward to a holiday there with her aunt and uncle and is \"excessively disappointed\" upon learning they cannot travel that far.\n\nThe opening of [[Charlotte Turner Smith]]'s novel ''Ethelinde'' with its atmospheric description of [[Grasmere (village)|Grasmere]], complete with a Gothic abbey, is supposed to have induced Wordsworth into looking to it as a possible place of residence.\n\nFilm director [[Ken Russell]] lived in the Keswick/Borrowdale area from 1975 to 2007<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thelakedistrict.info/2008/11/coombe-cottage.html |title=Coombe Cottage |publisher=Thelakedistrict.info |date=11 July 2006 |accessdate=21 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218052207/http://www.thelakedistrict.info/2008/11/coombe-cottage.html |archivedate=18 February 2009}}</ref> and used it in films such as ''[[Tommy (1975 film)|Tommy]]'' and ''[[Mahler (film)|Mahler]]''.\n\nThe German artist [[Kurt Schwitters]] visited the Lake District while in exile in Great Britain and moved there permanently in June 1945, remaining there for the rest of his life.\n\nThe Lake District is the setting for the 1977 [[Richard Adams]] novel ''[[The Plague Dogs]]''. Adams' knowledge of the area offers the reader a precise view of the natural beauty of the Lake District. The story is based at a fictionalised version of the remote hill farm of Lawson Park, overlooking Coniston Water. The base of contemporary art commissioner and residency base [[Grizedale Arts]] since 2007, Lawson Park now hosts artists' residencies, opens to the public on occasion, and has developed a significant garden that includes art works alongside extensive plantings. Grizedale Arts has produced many internationally significant cultural projects and has proved instrumental in the careers of several [[Turner Prize]]-winning artists, making Laure Provoust's winning installation 'Wantee' at Lawson Park, and bringing the exhibition to Coniston's [[Ruskin Museum]] in 2013. It also supported the refurbishment of the historic [[Coniston, Cumbria|Coniston]] Institute and developed an Honest Shop there (opening in 2012), an unstaffed shop stocking local crafts and produce.\n\nThe [[Keswick School of Industrial Art]] at Keswick was started by [[Canon Rawnsley]], a friend of [[John Ruskin]].\n\nAlso set in the Lake District is Sophie Jackson's mystery novel ''The Woman Died Thrice''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Clara Fitzgerald Mysteries |url=http://sophiejackson1984.wixsite.com/sophiejackson/fiction |website=Sophie Jackson's website |date= |accessdate=19 May 2017 }}</ref> It was published in 2016 under Jackson's pen name Evelyn James.\n\n== Nomenclature ==\nA number of words and phrases are local to the Lake District and are part of the [[Cumbrian dialect]], though many are shared by other northern dialects. These include:\n\n*[[Fell]] \u2013 from [[Old Norse]] {{lang|non|fjallr}}, brought to England by [[Viking]] invaders and close to modern Norwegian {{lang|no|fjell}} and Swedish {{lang|sv|fj\u00e4ll}} meaning mountain\n*Howe \u2013 place name from the [[Old Norse]] ''haugr'' meaning hill, knoll, or mound\n*[[tarn (lake)|Tarn]] \u2013 a word that has been taken to mean a small lake situated in a [[Cirque|corrie]] (the local name for which is ''cove'' or ''comb''), a local phrase for any small pool of water. The word is derived from the [[Old Norse]], Norwegian and Swedish word ''tjern/tj\u00e4rn'', meaning small lake.\n*[[Yan tan tethera]] \u2013 the name for a system of sheep counting which was traditionally used in the Lake District.

Significant towns immediately outside the boundary of the national park include [[Millom]], [[Barrow-in-Furness]], [[Kendal]], [[Ulverston]], Dalton-in-Furness, [[Cockermouth]], [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]], and [[Grange-over-Sands]]; each of these has important economic links with the area. Villages such as [[Coniston, Cumbria|Coniston]], [[Threlkeld]], [[Glenridding]], [[Pooley Bridge]], [[Broughton-in-Furness]], [[Grasmere (village)|Grasmere]], [[Newby Bridge]], [[Staveley, Cumbria|Staveley]], [[Lindale, Cumbria|Lindale]], [[Gosforth, Cumbria|Gosforth]] and [[Hawkshead]] are more local centres.

It is flanked to the east by the [[A6 road (England)|A6 road]] which runs from Kendal to Penrith (though the National Park extension approved in 2015 is east of the A6). The [[A590 road|A590]] which connects the M6 to [[Barrow-in-Furness]], and the [[A5092 road|A5092]] trunk roads cut across its southern fringes and the [[A66 road|A66]] trunk road between Penrith and [[Workington]] cuts across its northern edge. Finally the [[A595 road|A595]] (linking the A66 with the A5092) forms the park boundary from Calder Bridge to Holmrook, then crosses the coastal plain of the park until turning inland at the Whicham Valley.\n\nBesides these, a few [[Great Britain road numbering scheme|A roads]] penetrate the area itself, notably the [[A591]] which runs north-westwards from Kendal to Windermere and then on to Keswick. It continues up the east side of [[Bassenthwaite Lake]]. \"The A591, Grasmere, Lake District\" was short-listed in the 2011 [[Google Street View]] awards in the Most Romantic Street category. The [[A593 road|A593]] and [[A5084 road (Great Britain)#Four-digit roads (50xx)|A5084]] link the Ambleside and Coniston areas with the A590 to the south whilst the [[A592 road|A592]] and [[A5074 road|A5074]] similarly link Windermere with the A590. The A592 also continues northwards from Windermere to [[Ullswater]] and Penrith by way of the [[Kirkstone Pass]].\n\nSome valleys which are not penetrated by A roads are served by [[Great Britain road numbering scheme|B roads]]. The B5289 serves Lorton Vale and [[Buttermere, Cumbria|Buttermere]] and links via the [[Honister Pass]] with [[Borrowdale]]. The [[B5292 road|B5292]] ascends the [[Whinlatter Pass]] from Lorton Vale before dropping down to [[Braithwaite]] near Keswick. The [[B5322 road|B5322]] serves the valley of [[St John's in the Vale]] whilst [[Great Langdale]] is served by the [[B5343 road|B5343]]. Other valleys such as [[Little Langdale]], [[Eskdale, Cumbria|Eskdale]] and [[Duddon Valley|Dunnerdale]] are served by minor roads. The last of these is connected with the first two by the [[Wrynose Pass|Wrynose]] and [[Hardknott Pass|Hardknott]] passes respectively; both of these passes are known for their steep gradients and are together one of the most popular [[Climbing specialist|climbs]] in the United Kingdom for cycling enthusiasts.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Britain's top 10 toughest cycle climbs |last=Warren |first=Simon |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/jul/20/britains-top-10-toughest-cycle-climbs |newspaper=The Guardian |date=20 July 2012 |accessdate=6 September 2012}}</ref> A minor road through the [[Newlands Valley]] connects via [[Newlands Hause]] with the B5289 at Buttermere.

For instance, Seatoller to Wasdale head is about 6 miles on foot, but 49 miles by road.}}, as are [[Longsleddale]] and the valleys at [[Haweswater Reservoir|Haweswater]] and [[Kentmere]]. There are networks of minor roads in the lower-lying southern part of the area, connecting numerous communities between Kendal, Windermere and Coniston.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\n==== Railways and ferries ====\nThe [[West Coast Main Line]] skirts the eastern edge of the Lake District and the [[Cumbrian Coast Line]] passes through the southern and western fringes of the area. A single railway line, the [[Windermere Branch Line]], penetrates from Kendal to Windermere via Staveley. Railways once served Broughton-in-Furness and Coniston (closed to passengers in 1958) and another ran from Penrith to Cockermouth via Keswick (closed west of Keswick in 1966 and completely in 1972). Part of the track of the latter is used by the improved A66 trunk road.\n\nThe [[Cumbrian Coast line]] has three stations within the boundaries of the national park (and additionally [[Drigg]], about a third of a mile from the park boundary). The line gives railway enthusiasts and others a flavour of a pre-[[Beeching cuts|Beeching]] railway line, with features like manually operated level crossing gates, as well as giving a good connection to the steam railway into Eskdale and providing access for cyclists and serious walkers to the Western Fells.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.visitcumbria.com/the-cumbrian-coast-railway/|website=Visit Cumbria|accessdate=25 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe narrow gauge [[Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway]] runs from [[Ravenglass]] on the west coast up Eskdale as far as Dalegarth Station near the hamlet of Boot, catering for tourists. Another [[heritage railway]], the [[Lakeside and Haverthwaite Railway]], runs between Lake Windermere and [[Haverthwaite]], and tourists can connect at Lakeside with the boats up the lake to Bowness.\n\nA vehicle-carrying [[cable ferry]], the [[Windermere Ferry]], runs frequent services across Windermere. There are also seasonal passenger boats on Coniston Water, Derwent Water and Ullswater.\n\n==== Footpaths and bridleways ====\nThere are many paths over which the public has a [[Rights of way in England and Wales|right of way]], all of which should be signposted. Within the area of the National Park in 2012 there were {{convert|2159|km|abbr=on}} of [[Public footpath (England and Wales)|public footpaths]],\n{{convert|875|km|abbr=on}} of [[Public bridleway (England and Wales)|public bridleways]],\n{{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}} of [[restricted byway]]s and\n{{convert|30|km|abbr=on}} of [[Byway open to all traffic|byways open to all traffic]].

However the apparent radial pattern is not from a central dome, but from an axial watershed extending west-east from St Bees Head to Shap. Most of these valleys display the U-shaped cross-section characteristic of glacial origin, and often contain elongate lakes occupying sizeable [[bedrock]] hollows, with tracts of relatively flat ground at their infilled heads, or where they are divided by lateral tributaries (Buttermere-Crummock Water; Derwent Water-Bassenthwaite Lake). Smaller lakes known as [[tarn (lake)|tarns]] occupy [[cirque (landform)|glacial cirques]] at higher elevations. It is the abundance of both which has led to the area becoming known as the Lake District. The mountains of the Lake District are also known as the \"Cumbrian Mountains\", although this name is less frequently used than terms like \"the Lake District\" or \"the Lakeland Fells\". As the highest ground in England, [[Scafell Pike]] (978m/3210') naturally has a very extensive view on a clear day, ranging from the Galloway Hills of Scotland to the [[Mourne Mountains]] in Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man, and [[Snowdonia]] in Wales.\n{{wide image|Annotated Scafel Pike Panorama.jpg|3000px|A panorama from the summit of Scafell Pike, August 2007}}\n\nMany of the higher [[fell]]s are rocky, while [[moorland]] predominates at lower altitudes. Vegetation cover across better drained areas includes [[bracken]] and [[Calluna|heather]], though much of the land is [[bog]]gy, due to the high rainfall. Deciduous native woodland occurs on many of the  steeper slopes below the [[tree line]], but with native oak supplemented by extensive conifer plantations in many areas, particularly [[Grizedale Forest]] in the generally lower southern part of the area.  The Lake District extends to the sea to the west and south.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bing.com/maps/sharing|title=Maps|website=www.bing.com|accessdate=19 August 2019}}</ref>\n{{wide image|Wasdale screes.jpg|1000px|Panorama of the Wasdale screes descending into [[Wastwater]], the deepest lake in England.}}\n\n=== Valleys ===\n[[File:The Tongue Valley (looking from Dollywaggon Pike), near Troutbeck, Cumbria, at the Lake District National Park, United Kingdom, Europe (November 2008).jpg|thumb|The Tongue Valley (looking from ''Dollywaggon Pike'')]]\nThe principal radial valleys are (clockwise from the south) [[Dunnerdale]], [[Eskdale, Cumbria|Eskdale]], [[Wasdale]], [[Ennerdale Water|Ennerdale]], the Vale of Lorton and [[Buttermere]] valley, the [[River Derwent, Cumbria|Derwent Valley]] and [[Borrowdale]], the Ullswater valley, Haweswater valley, [[Longsleddale]], the [[Kentmere]] valley, those converging on the head of Windermere - Grasmere, [[Great Langdale]] and Little Langdale, and the Coniston Water valley. The valleys break the mountains up into separate blocks, which have been described by various authors in different ways. The most frequently encountered approach is that made popular by [[Alfred Wainwright]] who published seven separate area guides to the Lakeland Fells.\n\n=== Woodlands ===\nBelow the [[tree line]] are wooded areas, including British and European native [[oak]] woodlands and introduced softwood plantations. The woodlands provide habitats for native English wildlife. The native [[red squirrel]] is found in the Lake District and in a few other parts of England. In parts of the Lake District the rainfall is higher than in any other part of England. This gives [[Atlantic]] [[moss]]es, [[fern]]s, [[lichen]], and [[liverwort]]s the chance to grow. There is some [[ancient woodland]] in the National Park. Management of the woodlands varies: some are [[coppice]]d, some [[pollarding|pollarded]], some left to grow naturally, and some provide grazing and shelter.\n\n=== Fells (hills) ===\n[[File:Scafell massif.jpg|thumb|The impressive bulk of the [[Scafell]] massif, the highest ground in England, seen over [[Wasdale]].]]\n{{location map+|United Kingdom Lake District|relief=1|width=300|maplink=|float=|caption={{center|'''Some major fells and towns'''}}|places=\n<!-- Fells -->\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label='''[[Scafell Pike]]'''\n|label_size=100|mark=Montanya.svg|link=|marksize=16|position=right\n|lat=54.454222|long=-3.211528}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label='''[[Scafell]]'''\n|label_size=100|mark=Montanya.svg|link=|marksize=12|position=left\n|lat=54.448|long=-3.225}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label='''[[Scafell]]'''\n|label_size=100|mark=Montanya.svg|link=|marksize=12|position=left\n|lat=54.448|long=-3.225}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label='''[[Helvellyn]]'''\n|label_size=100|mark=Montanya.svg|link=|marksize=12|position=left\n|lat=54.527|long=-3.016}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label='''[[Skiddaw]]'''\n|label_size=100|mark=Montanya.svg|link=|marksize=12|position=right\n|lat=54.647|long=-3.146}}\n<!-- High Raise gets in the way and isn't very high\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[High Raise (Langdale)|Raise]]\n|label_size=100|mark=Blue Fire.svg|link=|marksize=9|position=right\n|lat=54.476|long=-3.113}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[High Raise (Langdale)|High]]\n|label_size=100|mark=Blue Fire.svg|link=|marksize=9|position=left\n|lat=54.476|long=-3.113}}-->\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[High Street (Lake District)|High Street]]\n|label_size=100|mark=Blue Fire.svg|link=|marksize=9|position=right\n|lat=54.492|long=-2.865}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Grasmoor]]\n|label_size=100|mark=Blue Fire.svg|link=|marksize=9|position=left\n|lat=54.571|long=-3.279}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Coniston Old Man]]\n|label_size=100|mark=Blue Fire.svg|link=|marksize=9|position=left\n|lat=54.37|long=-3.119}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Great Gable]]\n|label_size=100|mark=Blue Fire.svg|link=|marksize=9|position=left\n|lat=54.482|long=-3.219}}\n<!-- Places -->\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label={{font color|green|Kendal}}|label_size=|mark=Location dot green.svg|link=|marksize=6|position=right|lat=54.326|long=-2.745}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label={{font color|green|Penrith}}|label_size=|mark=Location dot green.svg|link=|marksize=6|position=right|lat=54.6648|long=-2.7548}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label={{font color|green|Keswick}}|label_size=|mark=Location dot green.svg|link=|marksize=6|position=right|lat=54.59|long=-3.14}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label={{font color|green|Ambleside}}|label_size=|mark=Location dot green.svg|link=|marksize=6|position=right|lat=54.4251|long=-2.9626}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label={{font color|green|Cockermouth}}|label_size=|mark=Location dot green.svg|link=|marksize=6|position=left|lat=54.6613|long=-3.362}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label={{font color|green|Windermere}}|label_size=|mark=Location dot green.svg|link=|marksize=6|position=right|lat=54.376|long=-2.907}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label={{font color|green|Grasmere}}|label_size=|mark=Location dot green.svg|link=|marksize=6|position=top|lat=54.45809|long=-3.02459}}\n}}\n{{See also|list of fells in the Lake District|list of hills in the Lake District}}\nThe four highest mountains in the Lake District exceed {{convert|3000|ft|m|0}}.

They culminate in the {{convert|931|m|ft|abbr=on}} peak of [[Skiddaw]]. Other notable peaks are [[Blencathra]] (also known as Saddleback) ({{convert|868|m|ft|abbr=on}}) and [[Carrock Fell]]. [[Bassenthwaite Lake]] occupies the valley between this massif and the North Western Fells.\n\n==== North Western Fells ====\nThe [[North Western Fells]] lie between [[Borrowdale]] and Bassenthwaite Lake to the east and [[Buttermere]] and [[Lorton Vale]] to the west. Their southernmost point is at [[Honister Pass]]. This area includes the Derwent Fells above the [[Newlands Valley]] and hills to the north amongst which are [[Dale Head]], [[Robinson (Lake District)|Robinson]]. To the north stand [[Grasmoor]], highest in the range at {{convert|852|m|ft|abbr=on}}, [[Grisedale Pike]] and the hills around the valley of [[Coledale (Cumbria)|Coledale]], and in the far north west is Thornthwaite Forest and [[Lord's Seat]]. The fells in this area are rounded [[Skiddaw slate]], with few tarns and relatively few rock faces.\n\n==== Western Fells ====\n[[File:Westmorland cairn Great Gable.jpg|thumb|The view towards [[Wast Water]] from the cairn built by the Westmorland brothers in 1876 to the SW of the summit of [[Great Gable]], which they considered the finest view in the district.]]\nThe [[Western Fells]] lie between Buttermere and [[Wasdale]], with [[Sty Head]] forming the apex of a large triangle. [[Ennerdale Water|Ennerdale]] bisects the area, which consists of the [[High Stile]] ridge north of Ennerdale, the [[Loweswater Fells]] in the far north west, the [[Pillar (Lake District)|Pillar]] group in the south west, and [[Great Gable]] ({{convert|2949|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}}) near Sty Head. Other tops include [[Seatallan]], [[Haystacks (Lake District)|Haystacks]] and [[Kirk Fell]]. This area is craggy and steep, with the impressive pinnacle of Pillar Rock its showpiece. [[Wastwater]], located in this part, is England's deepest lake.\n\n==== Central Fells ====\nThe [[Central Fells]] are lower in elevation than surrounding areas of fell, peaking at {{convert|762|m|ft|abbr=on}} at [[High Raise, Langdale|High Raise]]. They take the form of a ridge running between [[Derwent Water]] in the west and [[Thirlmere]] in the east, from [[Keswick, Cumbria|Keswick]] in the north to [[Langdale Pikes]] in the south. A spur extends south east to [[Loughrigg Fell]] above [[Ambleside]]. The central ridge running north over [[High Seat, Lake District|High Seat]] is exceptionally boggy.\n\n==== Eastern Fells ====\n[[File:Glenridding, Cumbria, England - June 2009.jpg|thumb|The village of [[Glenridding]] and [[Ullswater]] lake]]\nThe [[Eastern Fells]] consist of a long north-to-south [[ridge]], the [[Helvellyn range]], running from [[Clough Head]] to [[Seat Sandal]] with the {{convert|3118|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} [[Helvellyn]] at its highest point. The western slopes of these summits tend to be grassy, with rocky [[Cirque|corries]] and [[cliff|crags]] on the eastern side. The [[Fairfield (Lake District)|Fairfield]] group lies to the south of the range, and forms a similar pattern with towering rock faces and hidden valleys spilling into the [[Patterdale]] valley. It culminates in the height of [[Red Screes]] overlooking the [[Kirkstone Pass]].\n\n==== Far Eastern Fells ====\n[[File:Haweswater from Harter Fell 3.jpg|thumb|[[Haweswater Reservoir]] from [[Harter Fell (Mardale)|Harter Fell]]]]\nThe [[Far Eastern Fells]] refer to all of the Lakeland fells to the east of Ullswater and the A592 road running south to Windermere. At {{convert|828|m|ft|abbr=on}}, the peak known as [[High Street (Lake District)|High Street]] is the highest point on a complex ridge which runs broadly north\u2013south and overlooks the hidden valley of [[Haweswater Reservoir|Haweswater]] to its east. In the north of this region are the lower fells of Martindale Common and Bampton Common whilst in the south are the fells overlooking the [[Kentmere]] valley. Further to the east, beyond [[Mardale]] and [[Longsleddale]] is [[Shap]] Fell, an extensive area consisting of high [[moorland]], more rolling and [[Pennines|Pennine]] in nature than the mountains to the west.\n\n==== Southern Fells ====\n[[File:Coniston Water from Holme Fell.jpg|thumb|right|[[Coniston Water]] from [[Holme Fell]]]]\nThe [[Southern Fells]] occupy the southwestern quarter of the Lake District. They can be regarded as comprising a northern grouping between Wasdale, Eskdale and the two Langdale valleys, a southeastern group east of Dunnerdale and south of Little Langdale and a southwestern group bounded by Eskdale to the north and Dunnerdale to the east.\n\nThe first group includes England's highest mountains: [[Scafell Pike]] in the centre, at {{convert|3209|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} and [[Scafell]] {{convert|1|mi|spell=in}} to the southwest. Though it is slightly lower it has a {{convert|700|ft|m|-1|abbr=on}} rockface, Scafell Crag, on its northern side. It also includes the [[Wastwater Screes]] overlooking Wasdale, the [[Glaramara]] ridge overlooking Borrowdale, the three tops of [[Crinkle Crags]], [[Bowfell]] and [[Esk Pike]]. The core of the area is drained by the infant [[River Esk, Cumbria|River Esk]]. Collectively these are some of the Lake District's most rugged hillsides.\n\nThe second group, otherwise known as the [[Furness Fells]] or Coniston Fells, have as their northern boundary the steep and narrow  [[Hardknott Pass|Hardknott]] and [[Wrynose Pass|Wrynose]] passes. The highest are [[Old Man of Coniston]] and [[Swirl How]] which slightly exceed {{convert|800|m|-2|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe third group to the west of the Duddon includes [[Harter Fell, Eskdale|Harter Fell]] and the long ridge leading over [[Whitfell]] to [[Black Combe]] and the sea. The south of this region consists of lower forests and knolls, with [[Kirkby Moor]] on the southern boundary. The southwestern Lake District ends near the [[Furness]] peninsula and [[Barrow-in-Furness]], a town which many Lake District residents rely on for basic amenities.\n\n==== Southeastern area ====\nThe southeastern area is the territory between [[Coniston Water]] and [[Windermere]] and east of Windermere towards Kendal and south to Lindale. There are no high summits in this area which is mainly low hills, knolls and limestone [[cuesta]]s such as [[Gummer's How]] and [[Whitbarrow]]. Indeed, it rises only as high as {{convert|333|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} at [[Top o' Selside]] east of Coniston Water; the wide expanse of [[Grizedale Forest]] stands between the two lakes. [[Kendal]] and [[Morecambe Bay]] stand at the eastern and southern edges of the area.\n\n=== Lakes ===\n{{Wide image|Derwent Water, Keswick - June 2009.jpg|1200px|Derwent Water, one of 21 large water bodies in the Lake District}}\n{{See also|List of lakes in the Lake District}}\n{{location map+|United Kingdom Lake District|relief=1|width=300|maplink=|float=|caption={{center|'''Major lakes'''}}|places=\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Bassenthwaite Lake|Bassenthwaite]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=right|lat=54.65|long=-3.216667}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Brothers Water|Brotherswater]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=bottom|lat=54.505556|long=-2.925}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Buttermere|Butter-<br />mere]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=right|lat=54.533333|long=-3.266667}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Coniston Water|Coniston]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=left|lat=54.335|long=-3.08}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Crummock Water|Crummock]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=left|lat=54.56|long=-3.308}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Derwent Water|Derwent<br />Water]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=right|lat=54.574|long=-3.145}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Elter Water|Elterwater]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=left|lat=54.427469|long=-3.025875}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Ennerdale Water|Ennerdale]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=left|lat=54.52|long=-3.376111}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Esthwaite Water|Esthwaite]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=right|lat=54.359|long=-2.99}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Grasmere (lake)|Grasmere]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=left|lat=54.448834|long=-3.020897}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Haweswater Reservoir|Hawes-<br />water]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=right|lat=54.518889|long=-2.804722}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Loweswater]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=left|lat=54.5825|long=-3.355278}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Rydal Water]]'''|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=right|lat=54.446944|long=-2.996389}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Thirlmere]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=right|lat=54.533333|long=-3.066667}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Ullswater]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=right|lat=54.5775|long=-2.8751}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Wastwater]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=left|lat=54.441667|long=-3.291667}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Windermere]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=right|lat=54.390|long=-2.944}}\n}}\nOnly one of the lakes in the Lake District is called by that name, [[Bassenthwaite Lake]].

The intertidal zone of the combined estuaries includes sand, shingle and mudflats and [[saltmarsh]]. The dune systems on either side of the estuary are protected as nature reserves; Drigg Dunes and Gullery<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cwr.defra.gov.uk/default.aspx?Site=6167|title=Defra, UK - Rural Affairs|website=cwr.defra.gov.uk|accessdate=19 August 2019}}</ref> to the north and Eskmeals Dunes<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cumbriawildlifetrust.org.uk/nature-reserves/eskmeals-dunes|title=Eskmeals Dunes &#124; Cumbria Wildlife Trust|website=www.cumbriawildlifetrust.org.uk|accessdate=19 August 2019}}</ref> to the south. South of the estuary the coast is formed in low cliffs of glacial [[till]], sands and gravels.<ref>http://mapapps2.bgs.ac.uk/geoindex/home.html  BGS Geoindex Onshore</ref>\n\nThe district also extends to the tidal waters of [[Morecambe Bay]] and several of its estuaries alongside the [[Furness Peninsula|Furness]] and [[Cartmel Peninsula]]s, designated on M6 motorway signposts as the \"Lake District Peninsulas\", and the southern portions of which lie outside the park. These are the [[Duddon Estuary]], the [[River Leven, Cumbria|Leven Estuary]], and the western banks and tidal flats of the [[River_Kent#Lower_river|Kent Estuary]]. These areas are each characterised by sand and mudflats of scenic and wildlife interest. The coast is backed by extensive flats of raised marine deposits left when relative sea level was higher.\n\n== Geology ==\n{{main|Geology of the Lake District}}\n[[File:Lake District Geology Map.svg|thumb|Geological map of the Lake District showing the main structures and areas of mineralisation]]\n[[File:Skiddaw (cropped).JPG|thumb|Skiddaw seen from Derwentwater]]\nThe Lake District's geology is very complex but well-studied.<ref name=\"Gannon, Rock Trails Lakeland\">Gannon, ''Rock Trails Lakeland''</ref> A [[granite]] [[batholith]] beneath the area is responsible for this upland massif, its relatively low density causing the area to be \"buoyed up\". The granite can be seen at the surface as the Ennerdale, Skiddaw, Carrock Fell, Eskdale and Shap granites.\n\nBroadly speaking the area can be divided into three bands, the divisions between which run south west to north east. Generally speaking the rocks become younger from north west to south east. The north western band is composed of early to mid-[[Ordovician]] [[sedimentary rock]]s, largely [[mudstone]]s and [[siltstone]]s of marine origin. Together they comprise the [[Skiddaw Group]] and include the rocks traditionally known as the [[Skiddaw Slate]]s. Their [[friability]] generally leads to mountains with relatively smooth slopes such as Skiddaw itself.\n\nThe central band is a mix of [[volcanic]] and sedimentary rocks of mid-to-late Ordovician age comprising the [[lava]]s and [[tuff]]s of the [[Borrowdale Volcanic Group]], erupted as the former [[Iapetus Ocean]] was [[subduction|subducted]] beneath what is now the Scottish border during the [[Caledonian orogeny]]. The northern central peaks, such as Great Rigg, were produced by considerable lava flows. These lava eruptions were followed by a series of [[Pyroclastic flow|pyroclastic]] eruptions which produced a series of calderas, one of which includes present-day Scafell Pike. These pyroclastic rocks give rise to the craggy landscapes typical of the central fells.<ref name=\"Gannon, Rock Trails Lakeland\"/>\n\nThe south eastern band comprises the mudstones and [[wacke]]s of the [[Windermere Supergroup]] and which includes (successively) the rocks of the Dent, Stockdale, Tranearth, Coniston and Kendal groups. These are generally a little less resistant to erosion than the rocks sequence to the north and underlie much of the lower landscapes around Coniston and Windermere.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nLater [[intrusion]]s have formed individual outcrops of [[igneous rock]] in each of these groups.\nAround the edges of these Ordovician and Silurian rocks on the northern, eastern and southern fringes of the area is a semi-continuous outcrop of [[Carboniferous Limestone]] seen most spectacularly at places like [[Whitbarrow Scar]] and [[Scout Scar]].\n<ref>British Geological Survey Regional memoir ''Northern England'' 5th edn 2010</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lakedistrict.gov.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/171188/factsheet_geology.pdf|title=Geology Factsheet|publisher=Lake District National Park Authority Web|date=May 24, 2017|accessdate=December 2, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Climate ==\nThe Lake District's location on the northwest coast of England, coupled with its mountainous geography, makes it the wettest part of England. The UK [[Met Office]] reports average annual [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] of more than {{convert|2000|mm|in|-1|abbr=on}}, but with very large local variation.\n\nAlthough the entire region receives above average rainfall, there is a wide disparity between the amount of rainfall in the western and eastern lakes, as the Lake District experiences [[relief rainfall]]. [[Seathwaite, Allerdale|Seathwaite, Borrowdale]] is the wettest inhabited place in England with an average of {{convert|3300|mm|in|-1|abbr=on}} of rain a year,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/nw|title=UK regional climates|work=Met Office|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605003213/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/nw|archivedate=5 June 2011}}</ref> while nearby [[Sprinkling Tarn]] is even wetter, recording over {{convert|5000|mm|in|-1|abbr=on}} per year<ref>{{cite web |last1=Visit Cumbria |title=Lake District weather |url=https://www.visitcumbria.com/lake-district-weather/ |website=visitcumbria.com |accessdate=17 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Lake District Weatherline |title=Overview of weather |url=https://www.lakedistrictweatherline.co.uk/ |website=Lake District Weatherline |accessdate=17 October 2019}}</ref>; by contrast, Keswick, at the end of [[Borrowdale]] receives {{convert|1470|mm|in|abbr=on}} every year, and [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]] (just outside the Lake District) only {{convert|870|mm|in|abbr=on}}. March to June tend to be the driest months, with October to January the wettest, but at low levels there is relatively little difference between months.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nAlthough sheltered valleys experience [[gale]]s on an average of only five days a year, the Lake District is generally very windy with the coastal areas having 20 days of gales, and the fell tops around 100 days of gales per year. The maritime climate means that the Lake District experiences relatively moderate temperature variations through the year. Mean temperature in the valleys ranges from about {{convert|3|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}} in January to around {{convert|15|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}} in July. (By comparison, [[Moscow]], at the same latitude, ranges from {{convert|-10|to|19|C|F|abbr=on}}.)\n\nThe relatively low height of most of the fells means that, while snow is expected during the winter, they can be free of snow at any time of the year. Normally, significant snow fall only occurs between November and April. On average, snow falls on [[Helvellyn]] 67 days per year. During the year, valleys typically experience 20 days with snow falling, a further 200 wet days, and 145 dry days. Hill fog is common at any time of year, and the fells average only around 2.5 hours of sunshine per day, increasing to around 4.1 hours per day on the coastal plains.\n{{Weather box <!-- Infobox begins -->\n|collapsed=    <!-- Any entry in this line will make the template initially collapsed.

In 2002, the [[Environment Agency]] introduced a new fisheries byelaw, banning the use of all freshwater fish as live or dead bait in 14 of the lakes in the Lake District. Anglers not complying with the new byelaw can face fines of up to \u00a32,500. There are 14 lakes in the Lake District which are affected. These are: Bassenthwaite Lake, Brothers Water, Buttermere, Coniston Water, Crummock Water, Derwent Water, Ennerdale Water, Haweswater, Loweswater, Red Tarn, Thirlmere, Ullswater, Wast Water and Windermere.\n\nThe lakes and waters of the Lake District do not naturally support as many species of fish as other similar habitats in the south of the country and elsewhere in Europe. Some fish that do thrive there are particularly at risk from introduction of new species.\n\nThe introduction of non-native fish can lead to the predation of the native fish fauna or competition for food. There is also the risk of disease being introduced, which can further threaten native populations. In some cases, the introduced species can disturb the environment so much that it becomes unsuitable for particular fish. For example, a major problem has been found with [[ruffe]]. This non-native fish has now been introduced into a number of lakes in recent years. It is known that ruffe eat the eggs of vendace, which are particularly vulnerable because of their long incubation period. This means that they are susceptible to predators for up to 120 days. The eggs of other fish, for example [[Rutilus|roach]], are only at risk for as little as three days.\n\n== Economy ==\n\n=== Agriculture and forestry ===\n[[File:Forestry on Harter Fell.jpg|thumb|Forestry operations on [[Harter Fell, Eskdale|Harter Fell]]]]\n\nFarming, and in particular [[Domestic sheep|sheep farming]], has been the major industry in the region since [[Roman Britain|Roman]] times. The breed most closely associated with the area is the tough [[Herdwick]], with [[Rough Fell]] and [[Swaledale (sheep)|Swaledale]] sheep also common. Sheep farming remains important both for the economy of the region and for preserving the landscape which visitors want to see. Features such as [[dry stone wall]]s, for example, are there as a result of sheep farming. Some land is also used for [[silage]] and [[dairy farming]].\n\nThe area was badly affected by the outbreak of [[foot-and-mouth disease]] across the United Kingdom in 2001. The outbreak started in [[Surrey]] in February, but had spread to [[Cumbria]] by end of March.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Lake District 'nightmare' as fell farm is infected |last=Cadwalladr |first=Carole |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1327961/Lake-District-nightmare-as-fell-farm-is-infected.html |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=26 March 2001 |accessdate=27 August 2012}}</ref> Thousands of sheep, including the native [[Herdwick]]s which graze on the fellsides across the district, were destroyed. In replacing the sheep, one problem to overcome was that many of the lost sheep were ''heafed'', that is, they knew their part of the unfenced fell and did not stray, with this knowledge being passed between generations. With all the sheep lost at once, this knowledge has to be relearnt and some of the fells have had discreet [[electric fence]]s strung across them for a period of five years, to allow the sheep to \"re-heaf\".<ref>{{Cite news |title=If they go, it is the end of Lakeland |last=Griffin |first=Harry |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/apr/11/footandmouth.features11 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=11 April 2001 |accessdate=27 August 2012}}</ref> At the time of the outbreak, worries existed about the future of certain species of sheep such as [[Ryeland]] and Herdwick in the district,<ref>{{Cite news |title=Rare breeds 'could be lost' |last=MacClean |first=Matt |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1233458.stm |work=BBC News |date=21 March 2001 |accessdate=27 August 2012}}</ref> however these fears have been allayed and sheep now occupy the district in abundance.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Sheep breed resurrected decade on from foot and mouth |last=Clarke |first=Tom |url=http://www.channel4.com/news/sheep-breed-resurrected-decade-on-from-foot-and-mouth |work=Channel 4 News |date=9 February 2011 |accessdate=27 August 2012}}</ref>\n[[File:Thirleme 069.jpg|thumb|A young [[Herdwick]] grazing above [[Thirlmere]]. Older sheep of this breed are grey or white.]]\n\nForestry has also assumed greater importance over the course of the last century with the establishment of extensive conifer plantations around [[Whinlatter Pass]], in [[Ennerdale Water|Ennerdale]] and at [[Grizedale Forest]] amongst other places. There are extensive plantations of non-native pine trees.\n\n=== Industry ===\nWith its wealth of rock types and their abundance in the landscape, mining and quarrying have long been significant activities in the Lake District economy. In [[Neolithic]] times, the Lake District was a major source of stone [[axe]]s, examples of which have been found all over Britain. The primary site, on the slopes of the Langdale Pikes, is sometimes described as a \"stone axe factory\" of the [[Langdale axe industry]]. Some of the earliest [[stone circle]]s in Britain are connected with this industry.\n\nMining, particularly of copper, lead (often associated with quantities of silver), [[baryte]], [[graphite]] and [[slate]], was historically a major Lakeland industry, mainly from the 16th to 19th centuries. Coppiced woodland was used extensively to provide [[charcoal]] for smelting. Some mining still takes place today; for example, slate mining continues at the [[Honister Slate Mine|Honister Mines]], at the top of [[Honister Pass]]. Abandoned mine workings can be found on fellsides throughout the district. The locally mined graphite led to the development of the [[pencil]] industry, especially around [[Keswick, Cumbria|Keswick]].\n\n[[File:Lake District near Torver.jpg|thumb|A typical Lake District scene]]\n\nIn the middle of the 19th century, half the world textile industry's [[bobbin]] supply came from the Lake District area. Over the past century, however, tourism has grown rapidly to become the area's primary source of income.\n\n=== Development of tourism ===\n{{More citations needed|date=September 2011}}\nEarly visitors to the Lake District, who travelled for the education and pleasure of the journey, include [[Celia Fiennes]] who in 1698 undertook a journey the length of England, including riding through [[Kendal]] and over [[Kirkstone Pass]] into [[Patterdale]]. Her experiences and impressions were published in her book ''Great Journey to Newcastle and Cornwall'':\n\n<blockquote>As I walked down at this place I was walled on both sides by those inaccessible high rocky barren hills which hang over one\u2019s head in some places and appear very terrible; and from them springs many little currents of water from the sides and clefts which trickle down to some lower part where it runs swiftly over the stones and shelves in the way, which makes a pleasant rush and murmuring noise and like a snowball is increased by each spring trickling down on either side of those hills, and so descends into the bottoms which are a Moorish ground in which in many places the waters stand, and so form some of those Lakes as it did here.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=81JxDbc2KeIC&pg=PA183&dq=descends+into+the+bottoms+which+are+a+Moorish+ground&hl=en&ei=phdrTvmvHI_sOdbgrdcF&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=descends%20into%20the%20bottoms%20which%20are%20a%20Moorish%20ground&f=false An Anthology of Women's Travel Writing \u2013 Google Books]. Books.google.com. Retrieved on 2014-04-12.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1724, [[Daniel Defoe]] published the first volume of ''A Tour Thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain''. He commented on [[Westmorland]] that it was:\n\n<blockquote>the wildest, most barren and frightful of any that I have passed over in England, or even Wales itself; the west side, which borders on Cumberland, is indeed bounded by a chain of almost unpassable mountains which, in the language of the country, are called fells.</blockquote>\n\nTowards the end of the 18th century, the area was becoming more popular with travellers. This was partly a result of wars in [[Continental Europe]], restricting the possibility of travel there. In 1778 [[Thomas West (priest)|Thomas West]] produced ''A Guide to the Lakes'', which began the era of modern tourism.\n\n[[File:Claife Station.jpg|thumb|Claife Station on the western shore of [[Windermere]]]]\nWest listed \"stations\", viewpoints where tourists could enjoy the best views of the landscape, being encouraged to appreciate the formal qualities of the landscape and to apply aesthetic values. At some of these stations, buildings were erected to help this process. The remains of Claife Station (on the western shore [[Windermere]] below [[Claife Heights]]) can be visited today.\n\n[[William Wordsworth]] published his ''Guide to the Lakes'' in 1810, and by 1835 it had reached its fifth edition, now called ''A Guide Through the District of the Lakes in the North of England''. This book was particularly influential in popularising the region. Wordsworth's favourite valley was Dunnerdale or the [[Duddon Valley]] nestling in the south west of the Lake District.\n\nThe railways led to another expansion in tourism. The [[Kendal and Windermere Railway]] was the first to penetrate the Lake District, reaching [[Kendal]] in 1846 and [[Windermere, Cumbria (town)|Windermere]] in 1847. The line to [[Coniston, Cumbria|Coniston]] opened in 1848 (although until 1857 this was only linked to the national network with ferries between [[Fleetwood]] and [[Barrow-in-Furness]]); the line from [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]] through [[Keswick, Cumbria|Keswick]] to [[Cockermouth]] in 1865; and the line to [[Lakeside, Cumbria|Lakeside]] at the foot of [[Windermere]] in 1869. The railways, built with traditional industry in mind, brought with them a huge increase in the number of visitors, thus contributing to the growth of the tourism industry. Railway services were supplemented by steamer boats on the major lakes of [[Ullswater]], Windermere, [[Coniston Water]], and [[Derwent Water]].\n\n[[File:STEAMER ON ULLSWATER.jpg|thumb|A steamer on [[Ullswater]]]]\n\nThe growth in tourist numbers continued into the age of the motor car, when railways began to be closed or run down. The formation of the [[Lake District National Park]] in 1951 recognised the need to protect the Lake District environment from excessive commercial or industrial exploitation, preserving that which visitors come to see, without any restriction on the movement of people into and around the district. The [[M6 Motorway]] helped bring traffic to the Lake District, passing up its eastern flank. The narrow roads present a challenge for traffic flow and, from the 1960s, certain areas have been very congested.\n\nWhilst the roads and railways provided easier access to the area, many people were drawn to Lakeland by the publication of the ''[[Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells]]'' by [[Alfred Wainwright]]. First published between 1955 and 1966, these books provided detailed information on 214 fells across the region, with carefully hand-drawn maps and panoramas, and also stories and asides which add to the colour of the area. They are still used by many visitors to the area as guides for walking excursions, with the ultimate goal of [[Peak bagging|bagging]] the complete list of ''[[List of Wainwrights|Wainwrights]]''. The famous guides were revised by [[Chris Jesty]] between 2005 and 2009 to reflect changes, mainly in valley access and paths, and are currently being revised by Clive Hutchby, the author of The Wainwright Companion. The first of the revised volumes, Book One: The Eastern Fells, was published in March 2015; the most recent, Book Six: The North Western Fells, was published in April 2019.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jun/13/books.ruralaffairs | work=The Guardian | first=Martin | last=Wainwright | title=Famed fells guides join the 21st century | date=13 June 2005}}</ref>\n\nSince the early 1960s, the National Park Authority has employed rangers to help cope with increasing tourism and development, the first being [[John Wyatt (writer)|John Wyatt]], who has since written a number of guide books. He was joined two years later by a second, and since then the number of rangers has been rising.\n\nThe area has also become associated with writer [[Beatrix Potter]]. A number of tourists visit to see her family home, with particularly large numbers coming from Japan.\n\nTourism has now become the park's major industry, with about 12&nbsp;million visitors each year, mainly from the UK's larger settlements, China, Japan, Spain, Germany and the US.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/holiday/destinations/lake_district_cartmel |title=Desintations: Lake District |publisher=BBC\\ |date=27 January 2005 |archivedate=27 January 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050127144348/http://www.bbc.co.uk/holiday/destinations/lake_district_cartmel/ }}</ref> Windermere Lake Steamers are Cumbria's most popular charging tourist attraction with about 1.35&nbsp;million paying customers each year, and the local economy is dependent upon tourists. The negative impact of tourism has been seen, however. [[Soil erosion]], caused by walking, is now a significant problem, with millions of pounds being spent to protect overused paths. In 2006, two [[Visitor center|tourist information centres]] in the National Park were closed.\n\nCycling is now popular in the Lake District National Park.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lakedistrict.gov.uk/visiting/things-to-do/cycling|title=Lake District cycling|date=2017-04-25|website=Lake District National Park|language=en|access-date=2019-05-29}}</ref> A number of long-distance cycle routes go through the Lake District, including coast to coast cycle routes such as the [[Coast to Coast Cycle Route|C2C]], Hadrian\u2019s Cycleway, the Reivers Route and the Walney to Wear route. Several towns have also become hubs for road-cycling holidays and cycle touring, such as [[Keswick, Cumbria|Keswick]] and [[Ambleside]]. Mountain bikers use the trails constructed at Whinlatter Forest<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forestryengland.uk/whinlatter/cycling-and-mountain-biking-trails-whinlatter|title=Cycling and mountain biking trails at Whinlatter|website=Forestry England|language=en|access-date=2019-05-29}}</ref> and Grizedale Forest and also have wilder routes available on bridleways. \n\nCultural tourism is becoming an increasingly important part of the wider tourist industry. The Lake District's links with a wealth of artists and writers and its strong history of providing summer theatre performances in the old Blue Box of Century Theatre are strong attractions for visiting tourists. The tradition of theatre is carried on by venues such as [[Theatre by the Lake]] in Keswick with its summer season of six plays in [[repertoire (theatre)|repertoire]], Christmas and Easter productions, and the many literature, film, mountaineering, jazz and creative arts festivals, such as the [[Kendal Mountain Festival]] and the [[Keswick Mountain Festival]].\n\n=== Gastronomy ===\nExcellent mutton and lamb has been produced locally for generations and traditionally formed the basis of the region's many rustic dishes, such as Tatie Pot, a potato-topped mutton casserole.

[[Thomas Gray]] was the first to bring the region to attention, when he wrote a journal of his [[Grand Tour]] in 1769, but it was [[William Wordsworth]] whose poems were most famous and influential. Wordsworth's poem \"[[I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud]]\", inspired by the sight of [[daffodils]] on the shores of Ullswater, remains one of the most famous in the English language. Out of his long life of eighty years, sixty were spent amid its lakes and mountains, first as a schoolboy at [[Hawkshead]], and afterwards living in [[Grasmere (village)|Grasmere]] (1799\u20131813) and [[Rydal Mount]] (1813\u201350). Wordsworth, [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]] and [[Robert Southey|Southey]] became known as the [[Lake Poets]].\n\nThe poet and his wife lie buried in the churchyard of Grasmere and very near to them are the remains of [[Hartley Coleridge]] (son of the poet [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]), who himself lived for many years in Keswick, Ambleside and Grasmere. [[Robert Southey]], the [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]] and friend of Wordsworth (who would succeed Southey as Laureate in 1843), was a resident of Keswick for forty years (1803\u201343), and was buried in [[St Kentigern's Church, Crosthwaite|Crosthwaite churchyard]]. Samuel Taylor Coleridge lived for some time in Keswick, and also with the Wordsworths at Grasmere. From 1807 to 1815 [[John Wilson (Scottish writer)|John Wilson]] lived at Windermere. [[Thomas de Quincey]] spent the greater part of the years 1809 to 1828 at Grasmere, in the first cottage which Wordsworth had inhabited. Ambleside, or its environs, was also the place of residence both of [[Thomas Arnold]], who spent there the vacations of the last ten years of his life and of [[Harriet Martineau]], who built herself a house there in 1845. At Keswick, Mrs Lynn Linton (wife of [[William James Linton]]) was born, in 1822. [[Brantwood]], a house beside Coniston Water, was the home of [[John Ruskin]] during the last years of his life. His assistant [[W. G. Collingwood]] the author, artist and antiquarian lived nearby, and wrote ''Thorstein of the Mere,'' set in the Norse period.\n\nIn addition to these residents or natives of the Lake District, a variety of other poets and writers made visits to the Lake District or were bound by ties of friendship with those already mentioned above. These include [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], [[Sir Walter Scott]], [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], [[Arthur Hugh Clough]], [[Henry Crabb Robinson]], [[Richard Sharp (politician)|\"Conversation\" Sharp]], [[Thomas Carlyle]], [[John Keats]], [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Lord Tennyson]], [[Matthew Arnold]], [[Felicia Hemans]] and [[Gerald Massey]].\n\nAlthough it is unlikely she ever went there, [[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]] produced no less than sixteen poems on subjects within the Lake District and its surroundings, all associated with engravings within Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Books, from 1832 to 1838. Also included there (1834) is ''Grasmere Lake (A Sketch by a Cockney)'', a skit on becoming a 'lakes poet'.\n\nThe English composer Sir [[Arthur Somervell]] (1863 \u2013 1937) was born in Windermere.\n \nDuring the early 20th century, the children's author [[Beatrix Potter]] was in residence at [[Hill Top, Cumbria|Hill Top]] Farm, setting many of her famous [[Peter Rabbit]] books in the Lake District. Her life was made into a [[Miss Potter|biopic film]], starring [[Ren\u00e9e Zellweger]] and [[Ewan McGregor]]. [[Arthur Ransome]] lived in several areas of the Lake District, and set five of his [[Swallows and Amazons series]] of books, published between 1930 and 1947, in a fictionalised Lake District setting. So did [[Geoffrey Trease]] with his five Black Banner school stories (1949\u201356), starting with ''[[No Boats on Bannermere]]''.\n\nThe novelist [[Hugh Walpole|Sir Hugh Walpole]] lived at \"Brackenburn\" on the lower slopes of [[Catbells]] overlooking Derwent Water from 1924 until his death in 1941. Whilst living at \"Brackenburn\" he wrote ''The Herries Chronicle'' detailing the history of a fictional Cumbrian family over two centuries. The noted author and poet [[Norman Nicholson]] came from the south west lakes, living and writing about [[Millom]] in the 20th century \u2013 he was known as the last of the [[Lake Poets]] and came close to becoming the Poet Laureate.\n\nThe Lakes has been an inspirations for many notable artists. Some of the most famous artists to depict the region in their work have been [[Alfred Heaton Cooper]] and [[William Heaton Cooper]].\n\nWriter and author [[Melvyn Bragg]] was brought up in the region and has used it as the setting for some of his work, such as his novel ''A Time to Dance'', later turned into a television drama.\n\nThe Lake District has been the setting for crime novels by [[Reginald Hill]], [[Val McDermid]] and [[Martin Edwards (author)|Martin Edwards]]. The region is also a recurring theme in [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s 1926 novella ''[[The Torrents of Spring]]'' and features prominently in [[Ian McEwan]]'s ''[[Amsterdam (novel)|Amsterdam]]'', which won the 1998 [[Booker Prize]]. The 1996 [[Eisner Award]] winning graphic novel [[The Tale of One Bad Rat]] by [[Bryan Talbot]] featured a young girl's journey to and subsequent stay in the Lake District.\n\nThe Lake District is mentioned in [[Jane Austen]]'s ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]''; [[Elizabeth Bennet]] looks forward to a holiday there with her aunt and uncle and is \"excessively disappointed\" upon learning they cannot travel that far.\n\nThe opening of [[Charlotte Turner Smith]]'s novel ''Ethelinde'' with its atmospheric description of [[Grasmere (village)|Grasmere]], complete with a Gothic abbey, is supposed to have induced Wordsworth into looking to it as a possible place of residence.\n\nFilm director [[Ken Russell]] lived in the Keswick/Borrowdale area from 1975 to 2007<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thelakedistrict.info/2008/11/coombe-cottage.html |title=Coombe Cottage |publisher=Thelakedistrict.info |date=11 July 2006 |accessdate=21 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218052207/http://www.thelakedistrict.info/2008/11/coombe-cottage.html |archivedate=18 February 2009}}</ref> and used it in films such as ''[[Tommy (1975 film)|Tommy]]'' and ''[[Mahler (film)|Mahler]]''.\n\nThe German artist [[Kurt Schwitters]] visited the Lake District while in exile in Great Britain and moved there permanently in June 1945, remaining there for the rest of his life.\n\nThe Lake District is the setting for the 1977 [[Richard Adams]] novel ''[[The Plague Dogs]]''. Adams' knowledge of the area offers the reader a precise view of the natural beauty of the Lake District. The story is based at a fictionalised version of the remote hill farm of Lawson Park, overlooking Coniston Water. The base of contemporary art commissioner and residency base [[Grizedale Arts]] since 2007, Lawson Park now hosts artists' residencies, opens to the public on occasion, and has developed a significant garden that includes art works alongside extensive plantings. Grizedale Arts has produced many internationally-significant cultural projects and has proved instrumental in the careers of several [[Turner Prize]]-winning artists, making Laure Provoust's winning installation 'Wantee' at Lawson Park, and bringing the exhibition to Coniston's [[Ruskin Museum]] in 2013. It also supported the refurbishment of the historic [[Coniston, Cumbria|Coniston]] Institute and developed an Honest Shop there (opening in 2012), an unstaffed shop stocking local crafts and produce.\n\nThe [[Keswick School of Industrial Art]] at Keswick was started by [[Canon Rawnsley]], a friend of [[John Ruskin]].\n\nAlso set in the Lake District is Sophie Jackson's mystery novel ''The Woman Died Thrice''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Clara Fitzgerald Mysteries |url=http://sophiejackson1984.wixsite.com/sophiejackson/fiction |website=Sophie Jackson's website |date= |accessdate=19 May 2017 }}</ref> It was published in 2016 under Jackson's pen name Evelyn James.\n\n== Nomenclature ==\nA number of words and phrases are local to the Lake District and are part of the [[Cumbrian dialect]], though many are shared by other northern dialects. These include:\n\n*[[Fell]] \u2013 from [[Old Norse]] {{lang|non|fjallr}}, brought to England by [[Viking]] invaders and close to modern Norwegian {{lang|no|fjell}} and Swedish {{lang|sv|fj\u00e4ll}} meaning mountain\n*Howe \u2013 place name from the [[Old Norse]] ''haugr'' meaning hill, knoll, or mound\n*[[tarn (lake)|Tarn]] \u2013 a word that has been taken to mean a small lake situated in a [[Cirque|corrie]] (the local name for which is ''cove'' or ''comb''), a local phrase for any small pool of water. The word is derived from the [[Old Norse]], Norwegian and Swedish word ''tjern/tj\u00e4rn'', meaning small lake.\n*[[Yan tan tethera]] \u2013 the name for a system of sheep counting which was traditionally used in the Lake District. Though now rare, it is still used by some and taught in local schools.\n*Heaf (a variant of [[wikt:heft|heft]]) \u2013 the \"home territory\" of a flock of sheep\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|North West England|Cumbria}}\n*[[Regions of England]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*Gannon, P.
