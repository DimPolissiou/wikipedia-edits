Among the smaller towns in the [[Central Transdanubia]] Region of Hungary, it lies between the [[V\u00e9rtes Mountains|V\u00e9rtes]] and [[Bakony]] Hills, in the northwestern corner of Fej\u00e9r County. The historic roots of the present town go back to the Celtic and Roman period. The town is the economical, institutional and cultural centre of the small region of M\u00f3r including 13 settlements. The development of the town began with the arrival of [[Germans of Hungary|ethnic German settlers]] and [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] monks in 1697.\n\nThe [[Battle of M\u00f3r]] on December 30, 1848 was a crucial victory for the [[Austrian Empire]]'s forces in crushing the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]].\n\n[[File:Volt Lamberg kast\u00e9ly (3720. sz\u00e1m\u00fa m\u0171eml\u00e9k) 2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Lamberg Palace of M\u00f3r]]\n\n==The Wine Region of M\u00f3r==\nAntiquarian artefacts show that [[Vitis|vine]] growing occurred even in the [[Roman period]]. Vine growing came to stay from the 11th century in this area. The ethnic [[Danube Swabians|German]] settlers and the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] monks started to grow grape vines in the beginning of the 18th century. The oenological boom lasted until the [[Phylloxera]] bane in 1875-1880 that killed most of the vineyards. Afterwards, ''Ezerj\u00f3'' became the most important type of wine in M\u00f3r, which now belongs to the Hungaricums. ''Ezerj\u00f3'' is a heavy, late-ripening sort of vine.\n\nUnlike other parts of Hungary that produce sweet dessert wines, the wines from Mor tend to be clear and dry similar to a sauvignon blanc.  Smaller, locally owned vineyards are giving away to commercial growers who have discovered Mor's perfect climate, soil, and humidity.\n\nTimed to coincide with the grape harvest is the annual Wine Days of Mor festival, usually occurring in late September or early October.  For one week each year, the town's population explodes to support this rural festival that highlights local culture.  It includes the selection of a \"Wine Princess\" who oversees the festival, a multi-national parade celebrating Hungary's equestrian roots as well as the local wine culture, a stage for music, drama and dance, row upon row of stalls filled with regional food, crafts, local wines and palinka.  On the final Saturday evening of the festival a street party is held and the entire town turns into a big dance party.\n\n== The M\u00f3r massacre ==\nOn May 9, 2002, around noon, two armed men entered an [[Erste Bank]] office in M\u00f3r. For reasons unknown, they shot everyone in the building, including the customers, and left with 7.3&nbsp;million [[Forint]]s. Six people died instantly, the two survivors died in the hospital the following day. The case was not only notable for the brutality shown by the perpetrators, but also for the police confusion that followed: four days after the incident, police claimed that they had apprehended the two gunmen, [[Szil\u00e1rd Horv\u00e1th]] (who voluntarily gave himself up) and [[R\u00f3bert Farkas]]; the claim turned out to be false, however, as Horv\u00e1th proved his alibi, and Farkas turned out to be an unlikely suspect as well.<ref>[http://index.hu/politika/bulvar/moriossz/ Index - Politika - A m\u00f3ri \u00fcgy \u00f6t \u00e9ve: k\u00e9pek, esem\u00e9nyek<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOn July 22, police arrested [[Ede Kaiser]] and [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Hajd\u00fa]], who were also suspected to have committed the robbery. This claim seemed more plausible, as both suspects had criminal records, and the witness reports seemed to fit their likeness; a month later, however, police major [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Ferenczi]] admitted that all evidence in the case was indirect, and that the DNA tests failed to bring a result.

Among the smaller towns in the [[Central Transdanubia]] Region of Hungary, it lies between the [[V\u00e9rtes Mountains|V\u00e9rtes]] and [[Bakony]] Hills, in the northwestern corner of Fej\u00e9r County. The historic roots of the present town go back to the Celtic and Roman period. The town is the economical, institutional and cultural centre of the small region of M\u00f3r including 13 settlements. The development of the town began with the arrival of [[Germans of Hungary|ethnic German settlers]] and [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] monks in 1697.\n\nThe [[Battle of M\u00f3r]] on December 30, 1848 was a crucial victory for the [[Austrian Empire]]'s forces in crushing the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]].\n\n[[File:Volt Lamberg kast\u00e9ly (3720. sz\u00e1m\u00fa m\u0171eml\u00e9k) 2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Lamberg Palace of M\u00f3r]]\n\n==The Wine Region of M\u00f3r==\nAntiquarian artefacts show that [[Vitis|vine]] growing occurred even in the [[Roman period]]. Vine growing came to stay from the 11th century in this area. The ethnic [[Danube Swabians|German]] settlers and the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] monks started to grow grape vines in the beginning of the 18th century. The oenological boom lasted until the [[Phylloxera]] bane in 1875-1880 that killed most of the vineyards. Afterwards, ''Ezerj\u00f3'' became the most important type of wine in M\u00f3r, which now belongs to the Hungaricums. ''Ezerj\u00f3'' is a heavy, late-ripening sort of vine.\n\nUnlike other parts of Hungary that produce sweet dessert wines, the wines from Mor tend to be clear and dry similar to a sauvignon blanc.  Smaller, locally owned vineyards are giving away to commercial growers who have discovered Mor's perfect climate, soil, and humidity.\n\nTimed to coincide with the grape harvest is the annual Wine Days of Mor festival, usually occurring in late September or early October.  For one week each year, the town's population explodes to support this rural festival that highlights local culture.  It includes the selection of a \"Wine Princess\" who oversees the festival, a multi-national parade celebrating Hungary's equestrian roots as well as the local wine culture, a stage for music, drama and dance, row upon row of stalls filled with regional food, crafts, local wines and palinka.  On the final Saturday evening of the festival a street party is held and the entire town turns into a big dance party.\n\n== The M\u00f3r massacre ==\nOn May 9, 2002, around noon, two armed men entered an [[Erste Bank]] office in M\u00f3r. For reasons unknown, they shot everyone in the building, including the customers, and left with 7.3&nbsp;million [[Forint]]s. Six people died instantly, the two survivors died in the hospital the following day. The case was not only notable for the brutality shown by the perpetrators, but also for the police confusion that followed: four days after the incident, police claimed that they had apprehended the two gunmen, [[Szil\u00e1rd Horv\u00e1th]] (who voluntarily gave himself up) and [[R\u00f3bert Farkas]]; the claim turned out to be false, however, as Horv\u00e1th proved his alibi, and Farkas turned out to be an unlikely suspect as well.<ref>[http://index.hu/politika/bulvar/moriossz/ Index - Politika - A m\u00f3ri \u00fcgy \u00f6t \u00e9ve: k\u00e9pek, esem\u00e9nyek<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOn July 22, police arrested [[Ede Kaiser]] and [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Hajd\u00fa]], who were also suspected to have committed the robbery.
