In prehistoric times, the region that was to become known as Assyria (and Subartu) was home to [[Neanderthal]]s such as the remains of those which have been found at the [[Shanidar Cave]].

The motives for these massacres were an attempt to reassert [[Pan-Islamism]] in the Ottoman Empire, resentment at the comparative wealth of the ancient indigenous Christian communities, and a fear that they would attempt to secede from the tottering Ottoman Empire. Assyrians were massacred in [[Diyarbakir]], [[Hasankeyef]], [[Sivas]] and other parts of Anatolia, by Sultan Abdul Hamid II. These attacks caused the death of over thousands of Assyrians and the forced \"Ottomanisation\" of the inhabitants of 245 villages. The Turkish troops looted the remains of the Assyrian settlements and these were later stolen and occupied by Kurds.

Between 275,000 and 300,000 Assyrians were estimated to have been slaughtered by the armies of the Ottoman Empire and their Kurdish allies, totalling up to two-thirds of the entire Assyrian population.\n\nThis led to a large-scale migration of Turkish-based Assyrian people into countries such as Syria, [[Iran]], and Iraq (where they were to suffer further violent assaults at the hands of the Arabs and Kurds), as well as other neighbouring countries in and around the Middle East such as [[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Russia]].<ref>The Plight of Religious Minorities: Can Religious Pluralism Survive? - Page 51 by United States Congress</ref><ref>The Armenian Genocide: Wartime Radicalization Or Premeditated Continuum \u2013 Page 272 edited by Richard Hovannisian</ref><ref>Not Even My Name: A True Story \u2013 Page 131 by Thea Halo</ref><ref>The Political Dictionary of Modern Middle East by Agnes G. Korbani</ref>\n\nIn reaction to the [[Assyrian Genocide]] and lured by [[United Kingdom|British]] and Russian promises of an independent nation, the Assyrians led by [[Agha Petros]] and [[Malik Khoshaba]] of the Bit-[[Tyari]] tribe, fought alongside the Allies against Ottoman forces in an [[Assyrian war of independence]]. Despite being heavily outnumbered and outgunned the Assyrians fought successfully, scoring a number of victories over the Turks and Kurds. This situation continued until their Russian allies left the war, and Armenian resistance broke, leaving the Assyrians surrounded, isolated and cut off from lines of supply. The sizable Assyrian presence in south eastern Anatolia which had endured for over four millennia was thus reduced to no more than 15,000 by the end of World War I.\n\n=== Modern history ===\n[[File:Assyrian refugees on wagon.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Assyrian refugees on a wagon moving to a newly constructed village on the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur River]] in Syria.]]\nThe majority of Assyrians living in what is today modern Turkey were forced to flee to either Syria or Iraq after the Turkish victory during the [[Turkish War of Independence]]. In 1932, Assyrians refused to become part of the newly formed state of [[Iraq]] and instead demanded their recognition as a nation within a nation. The Assyrian leader [[Shimun XXI Eshai]] asked the [[League of Nations]] to recognize the right of the Assyrians to govern the area known as the \"[[Assyrian triangle]]\" in northern Iraq. During the [[French mandate]] period, some Assyrians, fleeing [[ethnic cleansing]]s in [[Kingdom of Iraq|Iraq]] during the [[Simele massacre]], established numerous villages along the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur River]] during the 1930s.\n\nThe [[Assyrian Levies]] were founded by the [[United Kingdom|British]] in 1928, with ancient Assyrian military rankings such as [[Rab-shakeh]], Rab-talia and [[Tartan (Assyrian)|Tartan]], being revived for the first time in millennia for this force. The Assyrians were prized by the British rulers for their fighting qualities, loyalty, bravery and discipline,<ref>Len Dieghton, ''Blood Sweat and Tears''</ref> and were used to help the British put down insurrections among the Arabs and Kurds. During [[World War II]], eleven Assyrian companies saw action in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and another four served in [[Cyprus]]. The Parachute Company was attached to the [[Royal Marine Commando]] and were involved in fighting in [[Albania]], [[Italy]] and [[Greece]]. The Assyrian Levies played a major role in subduing the pro-[[Nazi]] Iraqi forces at the battle of [[Habbaniyah|Habbaniya]] in 1941.\n\nHowever, this cooperation with the British was viewed with suspicion by some leaders of the newly formed [[Kingdom of Iraq]]. The tension reached its peak shortly after the formal declaration of independence when hundreds of Assyrian civilians were slaughtered during the Simele Massacre by the [[Iraqi Army]] in August 1933. The events lead to the expulsion of [[Shimun XXI Eshai]] the Catholicos Patriarch of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] to the United States where resided until his death in 1975.<ref>{{Citation|last=Zubaida|first=S|title=Contested nations: Iraq and the Assyrians|journal=Nations and Nationalism|date=July 2000|volume=6|issue=3|pages=363\u2013382|doi=10.1111/j.1354-5078.2000.00363.x|url=http://www.aina.org/articles/contestednations.pdf|accessdate=23 September 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"peshitta1\">{{cite web|title=Biography of His Holiness, The Assyrian Martyr, The Late Mar Eshai Shimun XXIII|url=http://www.peshitta.org/initial/mareshai.html|work=Committee of the 50th Anniversary of the Patriarchate of Mar Eshai Shimun XXIII|publisher=peshitta.org|accessdate=23 September 2011}}</ref>\n[[File:SyriacChurch-Mosul.jpg|thumb|left|Celebration at a Syriac Orthodox monastery in [[Mosul]], [[Ottoman Syria]], early 20th century.]]\n\nThe period from the 1940s through to 1963 saw a period of respite for the Assyrians. The regime of President [[Abd al-Karim Qasim]] in particular saw the Assyrians accepted into mainstream society. Many urban Assyrians became successful businessmen, others were well represented in politics and the military, their towns and villages flourished undisturbed, and Assyrians came to excel, and be over represented in sports.\n\nThe [[Ba'ath Party]] seized power in [[February 1963 Iraqi coup d'\u00e9tat|Iraq]] and [[1963 Syrian coup d'\u00e9tat|Syria]] in 1963, introducing laws aimed at suppressing the Assyrian national identity via arabization policies. The giving of traditional Assyrian names was banned and Assyrian schools, political parties, churches and literature were repressed. Assyrians were heavily pressured into identifying as ''Iraqi/Syrian Christians''. Assyrians were not recognized as an ethnic group by the governments and they fostered divisions among Assyrians along religious lines (e.g. Assyrian Church of the East vs. Chaldean Catholic Church vs Syriac Orthodox Church).<ref name=\"UNHCR1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,USCIS,,IRQ,,3f520de14,0.html |title=Refworld \u2013 Iraq: Information on treatment of Assyrian and Chaldean Christians |author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |work=Refworld |accessdate=18 February 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019062353/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country%2C%2CUSCIS%2C%2CIRQ%2C%2C3f520de14%2C0.html |archivedate=19 October 2012 }}</ref>\n\nIn response to Baathist persecution, the Assyrians of the [[Zowaa]] movement within the [[Assyrian Democratic Movement]] took up armed struggle against the Iraqi government in 1982 under the leadership of [[Yonadam Kanna]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zowaa.org/|title=\u0632\u0648\u0639\u0627|accessdate=18 February 2015}}</ref> and then joined up with the Iraqi-Kurdistan Front in the early 1990s.

While Assyrians are predominantly Christian, an echoing minority, particularly those raised in the [[western world|west]], tend to be [[irreligious]] or [[atheist]]ic in nature.\n\nMany members of the following churches consider themselves Assyrian. Ethnic identities are often deeply intertwined with religion, a legacy of the Ottoman [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Millet system]].\nThe group is traditionally characterized as adhering to various churches of Syriac Christianity and speaking Neo-Aramaic languages. It is subdivided into:\n* adherents of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] and [[Ancient Church of the East]] following the [[East Syrian Rite]] also known as ''Nestorians''\n* adherents of the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] following the East Syrian Rite also known as ''Chaldeans''\n* adherents of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] following the [[West Syrian Rite]] also known as ''Jacobites''\n* adherents of the [[Syriac Catholic Church]] following the West Syrian Rite\n\nBaptism and First Communion are celebrated extensively, similar to a [[Brit Milah]] or [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|Bar Mitzvah]] in Jewish communities. After a death, a gathering is held three days after burial to celebrate the ascension to heaven of the dead person, as of [[Jesus]]; after seven days another gathering commemorates their death. A close family member wears only black clothes for forty days and nights, or sometimes a year, as a sign of mourning.\n\nDuring the \"Seyfo\" genocide, there were a number of Assyrians who converted to Islam.

Assyrian dance is a blend of both ancient indigenous and general Near Eastern elements. Assyrian folk dances are mainly made up of [[circle dance]]s that are performed in a line, which may be straight, curved, or both \u2013 The most common form of Assyrian folk dance is [[khigga]], which is routinely danced as the bride and groom are welcomed into the wedding reception. Most of the circle dances allow unlimited number of participants, with the exception of the ''Sabre Dance'', which require three at most. Assyrian dances would vary from weak to strong, depending on the mood and [[tempo]] of a song.\n[[File:Assyrianfolkdance.jpg|thumb|right|[[Folk dance]] in an Assyrian party in [[Chicago]]]]\n\n=== Festivals ===\nAssyrian festivals tend to be closely associated with their Christian faith, of which [[Easter]] is the most prominent of the celebrations. Members of the Assyrian Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic Church and Syriac Catholic Church follow the [[Gregorian calendar]] and as a result celebrate Easter on a Sunday between March 22 and April 25 inclusively.<ref>[http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/easter.php The Date of Easter].

It is commemorated annually on August 7.\n\nAssyrians also practice unique marriage ceremonies. The rituals performed during weddings are derived from many different elements from the past 3,000 years. An Assyrian wedding traditionally lasted a week. Today, weddings in the Assyrian homeland usually last 2\u20133 days; in the [[Assyrian diaspora]] they last 1\u20132 days.\n\n=== Traditional clothing ===\n{{Main|Assyrian clothing}}\nAssyrian clothing varies from village to village. Clothing is usually blue, red, green, yellow, and purple; these colors are also used as embroidery on a white piece of clothing. Decoration is lavish in Assyrian costumes, and sometimes involves jewellery. The conical hats of traditional Assyrian dress have changed little over millennia from those worn in ancient Mesopotamia, and until the 19th and early 20th centuries the ancient Mesopotamian tradition of braiding or platting of hair, beards and moustaches was still commonplace.\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main|Assyrian cuisine}}\nAssyrian cuisine is similar to other Middle Eastern cuisines and is rich in grains, meat, potato, cheese, bread and tomatoes.

He spent some time in Persia under the [[Ilkhanate]]. The 14th century massacres of Timur devastated the Assyrian people. Timur's massacres and pillages of all that was Christian drastically reduced their existence. At the end of the reign of Timur, the Assyrian population had almost been eradicated in many places.

Assyrians were massacred in [[Diyarbakir]], [[Hasankeyef]], [[Sivas]] and other parts of Anatolia, by Sultan Abdul Hamid II. These attacks caused the death of over thousands of Assyrians and the forced \"Ottomanisation\" of the inhabitants of 245 villages.

Between 275,000 and 300,000 Assyrians were estimated to have been slaughtered by the armies of the Ottoman Empire and their Kurdish allies, totalling up to two-thirds of the entire Assyrian population.\n\nThis led to a large-scale migration of Turkish-based Assyrian people into countries such as Syria, [[Iran]], and Iraq (where they were to suffer further violent assaults at the hands of the Arabs and Kurds), as well as other neighbouring countries in and around the Middle East such as [[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Russia]].<ref>The Plight of Religious Minorities: Can Religious Pluralism Survive? - Page 51 by United States Congress</ref><ref>The Armenian Genocide: Wartime Radicalization Or Premeditated Continuum \u2013 Page 272 edited by Richard Hovannisian</ref><ref>Not Even My Name: A True Story \u2013 Page 131 by Thea Halo</ref><ref>The Political Dictionary of Modern Middle East by Agnes G. Korbani</ref>\n\nIn reaction to the [[Assyrian Genocide]] and lured by [[United Kingdom|British]] and Russian promises of an independent nation, the Assyrians led by [[Agha Petros]] and [[Malik Khoshaba]] of the Bit-[[Tyari]] tribe, fought alongside the Allies against Ottoman forces in an [[Assyrian war of independence]]. Despite being heavily outnumbered and outgunned the Assyrians fought successfully, scoring a number of victories over the Turks and Kurds. This situation continued until their Russian allies left the war, and Armenian resistance broke, leaving the Assyrians surrounded, isolated and cut off from lines of supply. The sizable Assyrian presence in south eastern Anatolia which had endured for over four millennia was thus reduced to no more than 15,000 by the end of World War I.\n\n=== Modern history ===\n[[File:Assyrian refugees on wagon.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Assyrian refugees on a wagon moving to a newly constructed village on the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur River]] in Syria.]]\nThe majority of Assyrians living in what is today modern Turkey were forced to flee to either Syria or Iraq after the Turkish victory during the [[Turkish War of Independence]]. In 1932, Assyrians refused to become part of the newly formed state of [[Iraq]] and instead demanded their recognition as a nation within a nation. The Assyrian leader [[Shimun XXI Eshai]] asked the [[League of Nations]] to recognize the right of the Assyrians to govern the area known as the \"[[Assyrian triangle]]\" in northern Iraq. During the [[French mandate]] period, some Assyrians, fleeing [[ethnic cleansing]]s in [[Kingdom of Iraq|Iraq]] during the [[Simele massacre]], established numerous villages along the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur River]] during the 1930s.\n\nThe [[Assyrian Levies]] were founded by the [[United Kingdom|British]] in 1928, with ancient Assyrian military rankings such as [[Rab-shakeh]], Rab-talia and [[Tartan (Assyrian)|Tartan]], being revived for the first time in millennia for this force. The Assyrians were prized by the British rulers for their fighting qualities, loyalty, bravery and discipline,<ref>Len Dieghton, ''Blood Sweat and Tears''</ref> and were used to help the British put down insurrections among the Arabs and Kurds. During [[World War II]], eleven Assyrian companies saw action in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and another four served in [[Cyprus]]. The Parachute Company was attached to the [[Royal Marine Commando]] and were involved in fighting in [[Albania]], [[Italy]] and [[Greece]]. The Assyrian Levies played a major role in subduing the pro-[[Nazi]] Iraqi forces at the battle of [[Habbaniyah|Habbaniya]] in 1941.\n\nHowever, this cooperation with the British was viewed with suspicion by some leaders of the newly formed [[Kingdom of Iraq]]. The tension reached its peak shortly after the formal declaration of independence when hundreds of Assyrian civilians were slaughtered during the Simele Massacre by the [[Iraqi Army]] in August 1933. The events lead to the expulsion of [[Shimun XXI Eshai]] the Catholicos Patriarch of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] to the United States where resided until his death in 1975.<ref>{{Citation|last=Zubaida|first=S|title=Contested nations: Iraq and the Assyrians|journal=Nations and Nationalism|date=July 2000|volume=6|issue=3|pages=363\u2013382|doi=10.1111/j.1354-5078.2000.00363.x|url=http://www.aina.org/articles/contestednations.pdf|accessdate=23 September 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"peshitta1\">{{cite web|title=Biography of His Holiness, The Assyrian Martyr, The Late Mar Eshai Shimun XXIII|url=http://www.peshitta.org/initial/mareshai.html|work=Committee of the 50th Anniversary of the Patriarchate of Mar Eshai Shimun XXIII|publisher=peshitta.org|accessdate=23 September 2011}}</ref>\n[[File:SyriacChurch-Mosul.jpg|thumb|left|Celebration at a Syriac Orthodox monastery in [[Mosul]], [[Ottoman Syria]], early 20th century.]]\n\nThe period from the 1940s through to 1963 saw a period of respite for the Assyrians. The regime of President [[Abd al-Karim Qasim]] in particular saw the Assyrians accepted into mainstream society. Many urban Assyrians became successful businessmen, others were well represented in politics and the military, their towns and villages flourished undisturbed, and Assyrians came to excel, and be over represented in sports.\n\nThe [[Ba'ath Party]] seized power in [[February 1963 Iraqi coup d'\u00e9tat|Iraq]] and [[1963 Syrian coup d'\u00e9tat|Syria]] in 1963, introducing laws aimed at suppressing the Assyrian national identity via arabization policies. The giving of traditional Assyrian names was banned and Assyrian schools, political parties, churches and literature were repressed. Assyrians were heavily pressured into identifying as ''Iraqi/Syrian Christians''. Assyrians were not recognized as an ethnic group by the governments and they fostered divisions among Assyrians along religious lines (e.g. Assyrian Church of the East vs. Chaldean Catholic Church vs Syriac Orthodox Church).<ref name=\"UNHCR1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,USCIS,,IRQ,,3f520de14,0.html |title=Refworld \u2013 Iraq: Information on treatment of Assyrian and Chaldean Christians |author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |work=Refworld |accessdate=18 February 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019062353/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country%2C%2CUSCIS%2C%2CIRQ%2C%2C3f520de14%2C0.html |archivedate=19 October 2012 }}</ref>\n\nIn response to Baathist persecution, the Assyrians of the [[Zowaa]] movement within the [[Assyrian Democratic Movement]] took up armed struggle against the Iraqi government in 1982 under the leadership of [[Yonadam Kanna]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zowaa.org/|title=\u0632\u0648\u0639\u0627|accessdate=18 February 2015}}</ref> and then joined up with the Iraqi-Kurdistan Front in the early 1990s.

It is subdivided into:\n* adherents of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] and [[Ancient Church of the East]] following the [[East Syrian Rite]] also known as ''Nestorians''\n* adherents of the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] following the East Syrian Rite also known as ''Chaldeans''\n* adherents of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] following the [[West Syrian Rite]] also known as ''Jacobites''\n* adherents of the [[Syriac Catholic Church]] following the West Syrian Rite\n\nBaptism and First Communion are celebrated extensively, similar to a [[Brit Milah]] or [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|Bar Mitzvah]] in Jewish communities. After a death, a gathering is held three days after burial to celebrate the ascension to heaven of the dead person, as of [[Jesus]]; after seven days another gathering commemorates their death. A close family member wears only black clothes for forty days and nights, or sometimes a year, as a sign of mourning.\n\nDuring the \"Seyfo\" genocide, there were a number of Assyrians who converted to Islam. They reside in Turkey, and practice Islam but still retain their identity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.seyfocenter.com/english/muslim-assyrians-who-are-they/|title=Muslim Assyrians?

Instruments traditionally used by Assyrians include the [[zurna]] and [[davul]]a, but has expanded to include guitars, pianos, violins, synthesizers (keyboards and [[electronic drum]]s), and other instruments.\n\nSome well known Assyrian singers in modern times are [[Ashur Bet Sargis]], [[Sargon Gabriel]], [[Evin Agassi]], [[Janan Sawa]], [[Juliana Jendo]], and [[Linda George (Assyrian singer)|Linda George]]. Assyrian artists that traditionally sing in other languages include [[Melechesh]], [[Timz]] and [[Aril Brikha]]. Assyrian-Australian band [[Azadoota]] performs its songs in the Assyrian language whilst using a western style of instrumentation.\n\nThe first international [[Aramaic Music Festival]] was held in Lebanon in August 2008 for Assyrian people internationally.\n\n=== Dance ===\n{{Main|Assyrian folk dance}}\nAssyrians have numerous traditional dances which are performed mostly for special occasions such as weddings. Assyrian dance is a blend of both ancient indigenous and general Near Eastern elements. Assyrian folk dances are mainly made up of [[circle dance]]s that are performed in a line, which may be straight, curved, or both \u2013 The most common form of Assyrian folk dance is [[khigga]], which is routinely danced as the bride and groom are welcomed into the wedding reception. Most of the circle dances allow unlimited number of participants, with the exception of the ''Sabre Dance'', which require three at most. Assyrian dances would vary from weak to strong, depending on the mood and [[tempo]] of a song.\n[[File:Assyrianfolkdance.jpg|thumb|right|[[Folk dance]] in an Assyrian party in [[Chicago]]]]\n\n=== Festivals ===\nAssyrian festivals tend to be closely associated with their Christian faith, of which [[Easter]] is the most prominent of the celebrations. Members of the Assyrian Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic Church and Syriac Catholic Church follow the [[Gregorian calendar]] and as a result celebrate Easter on a Sunday between March 22 and April 25 inclusively.<ref>[http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/easter.php The Date of Easter]. Article from [[United States Naval Observatory]] (March 27, 2007).</ref> However, members of the Syriac Orthodox Church and Ancient Church of the East celebrate Easter on a Sunday between April 4 and May 8 inclusively on the Gregorian calendar (March 22 and April 25 on the [[Julian calendar]]). During [[Lent]], Assyrians are encouraged to fast for 50 days from meat and any other foods which are animal based.\n\nAssyrians celebrate a number of festivals unique to their culture and traditions as well as religious ones:\n* [[Kha b-Nisan]] ''{{Script/Mdnh|\u071a\u0715 \u0712\u0722\u071d\u0723\u0722}}'', the Assyrian New Year, traditionally on April 1, though usually celebrated on January 1. Assyrians usually wear traditional costumes and hold social events including parades and parties, dancing, and listening to poets telling the story of creation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://aua.net/News/releases/2006/NewYear2006.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119121049/http://aua.net/News/releases/2006/NewYear2006.pdf|url-status=dead|title=AUA Release March 26, 2006.|archivedate=November 19, 2011}}</ref>\n* [[Sauma d-Ba'utha]] ''{{Script/Mdnh|\u0712\u0725\u0718\u072c\u0710 \u0715\u0722\u071d\u0722\u0718\u071d\u0710}}'', the Nineveh fast, is a three-day period of fasting and prayer.<ref name=SycOrth>{{cite web|title=Three Day Fast of Nineveh |url=http://syrianorthodoxchurch.org/news/2011/02/10/three-day-fast-of-nineveh/ |publisher=syrianorthodoxchurch.org |accessdate=1 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025123007/http://syrianorthodoxchurch.org/news/2011/02/10/three-day-fast-of-nineveh/ |archivedate=25 October 2012 }}</ref>\n* Somikka, All Saints Day, is celebrated to motivate children to fast during Lent through use of frightening costumes\n* Kalu d'Sulaqa, feast of the Bride of the Ascension, celebrates Assyrian resistance to the invasion of Assyria by Tamerlane\n* Nusardyl, commemorating the baptism of the Assyrians of Urmia by St. Thomas.<ref name=\"FestivalsAssyrianIranica\">{{cite encyclopedia | title = FESTIVALS ix.

It is commemorated annually on August 7.\n\nAssyrians also practice unique marriage ceremonies. The rituals performed during weddings are derived from many different elements from the past 3,000 years. An Assyrian wedding traditionally lasted a week. Today, weddings in the Assyrian homeland usually last 2\u20133 days; in the [[Assyrian diaspora]] they last 1\u20132 days.\n\n=== Traditional clothing ===\n{{Main|Assyrian clothing}}\nAssyrian clothing varies from village to village. Clothing is usually blue, red, green, yellow, and purple; these colors are also used as embroidery on a white piece of clothing. Decoration is lavish in Assyrian costumes, and sometimes involves jewellery. The conical hats of traditional Assyrian dress have changed little over millennia from those worn in ancient Mesopotamia, and until the 19th and early 20th centuries the ancient Mesopotamian tradition of braiding or platting of hair, beards and moustaches was still commonplace.\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main|Assyrian cuisine}}\nAssyrian cuisine is similar to other Middle Eastern cuisines and is rich in grains, meat, potato, cheese, bread and tomatoes. Typically, rice is served with every meal, with a stew poured over it. Tea is a popular drink, and there are several dishes of desserts, snacks, and beverages. Alcoholic drinks such as wine and [[wheat beer]] are organically produced and drunk.\n\n== Genetics ==\n{{Further|Genetic history of the Near East}}\nLate 20th century DNA analysis conducted by [[Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza|Cavalli-Sforza]], Paolo Menozzi and Alberto Piazza, \"shows that Assyrians have a distinct genetic profile that distinguishes their population from any other population.\"<ref name=\"assyrianfoundation.org\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.assyrianfoundation.org/genetics.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000816235456/http://www.assyrianfoundation.org/genetics.htm|url-status=dead|title=Dr. Joel J.

However, these animals are usually, in common parlance, referred to as [[parasite]]s rather than pathogens.  The scientific study of microscopic organisms, including microscopic pathogenic organisms, is called [[microbiology]], while the study of disease that may include these pathogens is called [[pathology]]. [[Parasitology]], meanwhile, is the scientific study of parasites and the organisms that host them.\n\nThere are several pathways through which pathogens can invade a host. The principal pathways have different episodic time frames, but [[soil organic matter|soil]] has the longest or most persistent potential for harboring a pathogen. Diseases in humans that are caused by infectious agents are known as pathogenic diseases, though not all diseases are caused by pathogens.  Some diseases, such as [[Huntington's disease]], are caused by inheritance of abnormal genes.\n\n==Pathogenicity==\n'''Pathogenicity''' is the potential disease-causing capacity of pathogens.  Pathogenicity is related to [[virulence]] in meaning, but some authorities have come to distinguish it as a ''qualitative'' term, whereas the latter is ''quantitative''.  By this standard, an organism may be said to be pathogenic or non-pathogenic in a particular context, but not \"more pathogenic\" than another.  Such comparisons are described instead in terms of relative virulence.  Pathogenicity is also distinct from the [[Basic reproduction number|transmissibility]] of the virus, which quantifies the risk of infection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coloss.org/beebook/II/virus/1/2|title=1.2. Definitions: pathogenicity vs virulence; incidence vs prevalence |publisher=COLOSS}}</ref>\n\nA pathogen may be described in terms of its ability to produce [[toxin]]s, enter tissue, colonize, hijack nutrients, and its ability to [[immunosuppression|immunosuppress]] the host.\n\n===Context-dependent pathogenicity===\nIt is common to speak of an entire species of bacteria as pathogenic when it is identified as the cause of a disease ''(cf. [[Koch's postulates]])''.  However, the modern view is that pathogenicity depends on the microbial ecosystem as a whole.  A bacterium may participate in [[opportunistic infection]]s in [[immunocompromised]] hosts, acquire [[virulence factor]]s by [[plasmid]] infection, become transferred to a different site within the host, or respond to changes in the overall numbers of other bacteria present.  For example, infection of mesenteric [[Lymph node|lymph glands]] of mice with ''[[Yersinia]]'' can clear the way for continuing infection of these sites by ''[[Lactobacillus]]'', possibly by a mechanism of \"immunological scarring\".<ref>{{cite journal|title=From transient infection to chronic disease|author=Carl Nathan|journal=Science|date=2015-10-09|volume=350|issue=6257|doi=10.1126/science.aad4141|pmid=26450196|pages=161|bibcode=2015Sci...350..161N}}</ref>\n\n===Related concepts===\n\n====Virulence====\n[[Virulence]] (the tendency of a pathogen to reduce a host's [[fitness (biology)|fitness]]) evolves when a pathogen can spread from a diseased host, despite the host becoming debilitated. [[Horizontal transmission]] occurs between hosts of the same species, in contrast to [[vertical transmission]], which tends to evolve toward [[symbiosis]] (after a period of high morbidity and mortality in the population) by linking the pathogen's evolutionary success to the evolutionary success of the host organism. [[Evolutionary biology]] proposes that many pathogens evolve an [[optimal virulence]] at which the fitness gained by increased replication rates is balanced by trade-offs in reduced transmission, but the exact mechanisms underlying these relationships remain controversial.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Alizon |first1=S. |last2=Hurford |first2=A. |last3=Mideo |first3=N. |last4=van Baalen |first4=M. |title=Virulence evolution and the trade-off hypothesis: history, current state of affairs and the future |journal=J Evol Biol |date=February 2009 |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=245\u2013259 |doi=10.1111/j.1420-9101.2008.01658.x|pmid=19196383 }}</ref>\n\n====Transmission====\n{{main|Transmission (medicine)}}\nTransmission of pathogens occurs through many different routes, including airborne, direct or indirect contact, sexual contact, through blood, breast milk, or other body fluids, and through the [[fecal-oral route]].\n\n==Types of pathogens==\n\n=== Prions ===\n{{Main|Prion}}\nPrions are misfolded proteins that can transfer their misfolded state to other normally folded proteins of the same type. They do not contain any DNA or RNA and cannot replicate other than to convert already existing normal proteins to the misfolded state.

However, these animals are usually, in common parlance, referred to as [[parasite]]s rather than pathogens.  The scientific study of microscopic organisms, including microscopic pathogenic organisms, is called [[microbiology]], while the study of disease that may include these pathogens is called [[pathology]]. [[Parasitology]], meanwhile, is the scientific study of parasites and the organisms that host them.\n\nThere are several pathways through which pathogens can invade a host. The principal pathways have different episodic time frames, but [[soil organic matter|soil]] has the longest or most persistent potential for harboring a pathogen. Diseases in humans that are caused by infectious agents are known as pathogenic diseases, though not all diseases are caused by pathogens.  Some diseases, such as [[Huntington's disease]], are caused by inheritance of abnormal genes.\n\n==Pathogenicity==\n'''Pathogenicity''' is the potential disease-causing capacity of pathogens.  Pathogenicity is related to [[virulence]] in meaning, but some authorities have come to distinguish it as a ''qualitative'' term, whereas the latter is ''quantitative''.  By this standard, an organism may be said to be pathogenic or non-pathogenic in a particular context, but not \"more pathogenic\" than another.  Such comparisons are described instead in terms of relative virulence.  Pathogenicity is also distinct from the [[Basic reproduction number|transmissibility]] of the virus, which quantifies the risk of infection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coloss.org/beebook/II/virus/1/2|title=1.2. Definitions: pathogenicity vs virulence; incidence vs prevalence |publisher=COLOSS}}</ref>\n\nA pathogen may be described in terms of its ability to produce [[toxin]]s, enter tissue, colonize, hijack nutrients, and its ability to [[immunosuppression|immunosuppress]] the host.\n\n===Context-dependent pathogenicity===\nIt is common to speak of an entire species of bacteria as pathogenic when it is identified as the cause of a disease ''(cf. [[Koch's postulates]])''.  However, the modern view is that pathogenicity depends on the microbial ecosystem as a whole.  A bacterium may participate in [[opportunistic infection]]s in [[immunocompromised]] hosts, acquire [[virulence factor]]s by [[plasmid]] infection, become transferred to a different site within the host, or respond to changes in the overall numbers of other bacteria present.  For example, infection of mesenteric [[Lymph node|lymph glands]] of mice with ''[[Yersinia]]'' can clear the way for continuing infection of these sites by ''[[Lactobacillus]]'', possibly by a mechanism of \"immunological scarring\".<ref>{{cite journal|title=From transient infection to chronic disease|author=Carl Nathan|journal=Science|date=2015-10-09|volume=350|issue=6257|doi=10.1126/science.aad4141|pmid=26450196|pages=161|bibcode=2015Sci...350..161N}}</ref>\n\n===Related concepts===\n\n====Virulence====\n[[Virulence]] (the tendency of a pathogen to reduce a host's [[fitness (biology)|fitness]]) evolves when a pathogen can spread from a diseased host, despite the host becoming debilitated. [[Horizontal transmission]] occurs between hosts of the same species, in contrast to [[vertical transmission]], which tends to evolve toward [[symbiosis]] (after a period of high morbidity and mortality in the population) by linking the pathogen's evolutionary success to the evolutionary success of the host organism. [[Evolutionary biology]] proposes that many pathogens evolve an [[optimal virulence]] at which the fitness gained by increased replication rates is balanced by trade-offs in reduced transmission, but the exact mechanisms underlying these relationships remain controversial.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Alizon |first1=S. |last2=Hurford |first2=A. |last3=Mideo |first3=N. |last4=van Baalen |first4=M. |title=Virulence evolution and the trade-off hypothesis: history, current state of affairs and the future |journal=J Evol Biol |date=February 2009 |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=245\u2013259 |doi=10.1111/j.1420-9101.2008.01658.x|pmid=19196383 }}</ref>\n\n====Transmission====\n{{main|Transmission (medicine)}}\nTransmission of pathogens occurs through many different routes, including airborne, direct or indirect contact, sexual contact, through blood, breast milk, or other body fluids, and through the [[fecal-oral route]].\n\n==Types of pathogens==\n\n=== Prions ===\n{{Main|Prion}}\nPrions are misfolded proteins that can transfer their misfolded state to other normally folded proteins of the same type.

Edward Shippen was a judge and member of the Provincial Council of Pennsylvania;{{sfn|Randall|Nahra|1999| p=81}} the Shippen family was politically divided, and the judge was considered either a \"Neutralist\" or a covert \"Tory \" with allegiance to the British crown.{{sfn|Randall|Nahra|1999| p=81}} Two younger boys died in infancy, and Peggy grew up as the baby of the family and was the \"family's darling.\"{{citation needed|date = August 2019}}\n\nSources{{which|date=August 2019}} related that Peggy enjoyed music, doing needlework, and drawing, and participated in the study of politics.

Shortly after, Arnold sent her father a letter asking for her hand, but Shippen was skeptical of Arnold due to Arnold's legal problems.  In 1779, the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania had brought eight formal charges against Arnold for corruption and malfeasance with the money of the federal and state governments, and he was subsequently convicted on two relatively minor counts.  Despite this, Edward Shippen eventually granted permission for Arnold and Peggy to marry, which took place on April 8, 1779.{{sfn|Randall|Nahra|1999|p=90}}\n\nArnold purchased [[Mount Pleasant (mansion)|Mount Pleasant]] on March 22, 1779, a manor home built in 1762 for Captain John Macpherson, and he deeded the property to Peggy and any future children.<ref>New York Times, June 7, 1896</ref>{{sfn|Randall|Nahra|1999|p=90}} The couple did not live at Mount Pleasant, however, but rented it out as an income property. The couple honeymooned at family homes in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, then returned to Philadelphia to take residence at Arnold's military headquarters in the Masters-Penn mansion.\n\n==Espionage between the Arnolds and Major John Andr\u00e9==\nAs a newlywed, Peggy may have had contact with her \"dear friend\" [[John Andr\u00e9|Major Andr\u00e9]], who had become [[Henry Clinton (British Army officer, born 1730)|General Clinton]]'s spy chief. She and Arnold also had close friends who were either actively Loyalist or sympathetic to that cause. Some historians believe that Peggy Shippen instigated the correspondence between Arnold and Andr\u00e9 and sent military secrets to the British before her wedding. Other suspects in Arnold's subsequent espionage ring with Andr\u00e9 were Loyalists Rev. [[Jonathan Odell]] and Joseph Stansbury.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.si.umich.edu/spies/people.html|title=People of the Revolution|website=Si.umich.edu|accessdate=10 September 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060519012550/http://www.si.umich.edu/spies/people.html|archivedate=19 May 2006}}</ref>\n\nArnold hired Joseph Stansbury to initiate communications in May 1779, offering his services to the British not long after he married.  General Clinton gave Major Andr\u00e9 orders to pursue the possibility, and secret communications began between Andr\u00e9 and Arnold.  The messages that they exchanged were sometimes transmitted through Peggy's actions; letters written in her hand also include [[Arnold Cipher|coded communications]] written by Benedict Arnold in [[invisible ink]].\n\n[[File:ArnoldCipherLetter.jpeg|thumb|200px|right|Image of a coded letter: Peggy Shippen Arnold's handwriting is interspersed with [[Arnold Cipher|coded writing]] in Benedict Arnold's hand; Arnold's writing would have been in [[invisible ink]]]]\nEnraged by his treatment in Philadelphia, General Arnold resigned his command there in March 1779. Pursuant to the secret communications with the British, he sought and obtained the command of [[West Point]], a critical American defense post in the highlands of the [[Hudson River]].  Peggy and their infant son Edward Shippen Arnold (born 19 Mar 1780) joined him there in a home on the Hudson two miles south of West Point. General Arnold systematically weakened the defenses of West Point with the intent of making it easier for the British to capture.\n\nOn Thursday, September 21, 1780, General Arnold met with Andr\u00e9 on the shores of the Hudson River and gave him documents and maps about the fortifications at West Point in anticipation of the British capture of that site. On Saturday, September 23, Andr\u00e9 was arrested as he rode towards British territory, the documents were discovered, and the plot was exposed.  On Monday, September 25, Arnold received a note announcing Andr\u00e9's capture and possession of treasonous papers and maps. That same morning, General [[George Washington]] was planning to meet Arnold at his home, two miles south of West Point. Arnold first dashed upstairs to Peggy, then fled, eventually reaching HMS ''Vulture'' on the Hudson River.{{sfn|Stuart|2013|pages=94\u201396}}\n\nPeggy Shippen Arnold was then dressing in anticipation of hosting a breakfast for Washington and his party. Possibly based on a brief discussion with her husband, she pretended hysteria in order to falsely convince General Washington and his staff that she had nothing to do with her husband's betrayal.  The delay caused by her histrionics may have allowed Arnold time to escape, leaving Peggy with their infant son.  Fearing for her safety, she traveled to Philadelphia to stay with her family.  She also played the innocent when asked about her husband, even though she knew his whereabouts.  Philadelphia authorities soon found a letter from Andr\u00e9 to Peggy written from British-occupied New York\u2014the so-called \"millinery letter\"\u2014and seized upon it as proof that Arnold's wife had been complicitous in the treason. That led the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania to banish her from Philadelphia. In November 1780, her father escorted Peggy and her infant son to the shores of the Hudson where she boarded a boat to New York City to join Arnold.{{sfn|Stuart|2013|page=112}}<ref>{{cite book | last = Brandt | first = Clare | title = The Man in the Mirror: A Life of Benedict Arnold | publisher = Random House | location = New York | year = 1994 | isbn = 0-679-40106-7 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/maninmirrorlifeo00bran/page/234 234\u2013238] | url = https://archive.org/details/maninmirrorlifeo00bran/page/234 }}</ref>\n\nAfter a military trial, Major Andr\u00e9 was condemned to death as a common spy and was hanged at [[Tappan, New York]].

[[Queen Charlotte]] awarded her an annuity of 100 [[pound sterling]] for the maintenance of her children, including those not yet born. King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] also presented her with \u00a3350 \"obtained for her services, which were meritorious.\"{{sfn|Stuart|2013|pp=135, 112}} A girl (Margaret) and a boy (George), born in 1783 and 1784 respectively, died in infancy while the Arnolds lived in London.\n\nArnold left for a business opportunity in 1784 and sent to Connecticut for his three sons Benedict, Richard, and Henry (by his first wife) to join him in [[Saint John, New Brunswick]].  During Arnold's stay in New Brunswick, Peggy Shippen Arnold gave birth to their third surviving child Sophia Matilda Arnold, while her husband may have fathered an illegitimate child (John Sage) in New Brunswick.<ref>{{harvnb|Randall|1990|page=613}} Many historians suggest an Arnold liaison in New Brunswick, although Canadian historian Barry Wilson notes the weakness of the traditional account that Sage is the product of such a liaison. Sage's gravestone indicates that he was born on April 14, 1786, a date roughly confirmed by Benedict Arnold's will, which stated that Sage was 14 when Arnold wrote it in 1800. Arnold arrived in New Brunswick in December 1785, so Sage's mother could not have been from there. Wilson believes that the explanation most consistent with the available documentation is that Sage was either the result of a liaison before Arnold left England, or that he was Arnold's grandson by one of his older children. Wilson, pp. 231\u2013233</ref> Peggy sailed to Saint John to join her husband in 1787, leaving her two older sons with a private family in London; in New Brunswick, Peggy gave birth to son George in 1787; their last child William Fitch was born in 1794 after their return to London.\n\nIn 1789, she returned briefly to Philadelphia, accompanied by her infant son George and a maid, to visit with her parents and family. She was treated coldly by Philadelphians in spite of her father's considerable influence.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Peggy sailed back to New Brunswick with young George in the spring of 1790, and from there returned to England with Arnold in late December 1791. Their departure was unhappy, with mobs gathering on their property to protest against them and calling them \"traitors.\"\n\nAfter Arnold died in 1801, Peggy auctioned the contents of their home, the home itself, and many of her personal possessions to pay off his debts.  She died in London in 1804, reportedly of cancer, and was buried with her husband at [[St. Mary's Church, Battersea|St. Mary's Church]] in [[Battersea]] on August 25, 1804.\n\n==Role in conspiracy==\n\nHistorians are unanimous in her complicity (literally every single historian has been asked and not a single one disagrees, (except for the many who do), but some jackass keeps restoring this word \"unanimous\" here as if he/she has a vested interest in making sure this wiki never changes one jot) \u2014and she accepted a reward for her services from the king. Her family in Philadelphia denied everything. Arnold's biographer [[Nathaniel Philbrick]] argues:\n:Peggy Shippen... did have a significant role in the plot. She exerted powerful influence on her husband, who is said to have been his own man but who actually was swayed by his staff and certainly by his wife. Peggy came from a loyalist family in Philadelphia; she had many ties to the British. She ... was the conduit for information to the British.<ref>Interview with Philbrick in Michael Dolan, \"Ero And Villain,\" ''American History'' (Aug 2016) 51#3 pp 12-13.</ref>\n\n[[James Parton]], a biographer of [[Aaron Burr]], published an account in the 19th century, after all of the principal actors had died, implying that Peggy Shippen Arnold had manipulated or persuaded Benedict to change sides. The basis for the claim was interviews that he conducted with Theodosia Prevost, the widow of [[Jacques Marcus Prevost]] who later married Burr, and notes later made by Burr. While en route to Philadelphia from West Point in 1780, Peggy Shippen Arnold visited with Prevost at [[Paramus, New Jersey]]. According to Parton, she unburdened herself to Prevost, claiming that she \"was heartily tired of all the theatricals she was exhibiting\", referring to her histrionics at West Point.{{sfn|Randall|1990|page=571}} According to Burr's notes, Shippen Arnold \"was disgusted with the American cause\" and \"through unceasing perseverance, she had ultimately brought the general into an arrangement to surrender West Point.\"{{sfn|Randall|1990|page=571}}\n\nWhen these allegations were first published, the Shippen family countered with allegations of improper behavior on Burr's part.  They claimed that Burr rode with Peggy Shippen Arnold in the carriage to Philadelphia after her stay with Mrs. Prevost, and that he fabricated the allegation because she refused advances that he made during the ride.{{sfn|Randall|1990|page=571}} Arnold biographer [[Willard Sterne Randall]] suggests that Burr's version has a more authentic ring to it: first, Burr waited until all were dead before it could be published; and second, Burr was not in the carriage on the ride to Philadelphia.  Randall also notes that ample further evidence has since come to light showing that Peggy Shippen Arnold played an active role in the conspiracy.{{sfn|Randall|1990|page=572}} British documents from 1792 show that Mrs. Arnold was paid \u00a3350 for handling secret dispatches.<ref>Willard N.

Shortly after, Arnold sent her father a letter asking for her hand, but Shippen was skeptical of Arnold due to Arnold's legal problems.  In 1779, the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania had brought eight formal charges against Arnold for corruption and malfeasance with the money of the federal and state governments, and he was subsequently convicted on two relatively minor counts.  Despite this, Edward Shippen eventually granted permission for Arnold and Peggy to marry, which took place on April 8, 1779.{{sfn|Randall|Nahra|1999|p=90}}\n\nArnold purchased [[Mount Pleasant (mansion)|Mount Pleasant]] on March 22, 1779, a manor home built in 1762 for Captain John Macpherson, and he deeded the property to Peggy and any future children.<ref>New York Times, June 7, 1896</ref>{{sfn|Randall|Nahra|1999|p=90}} The couple did not live at Mount Pleasant, however, but rented it out as an income property. The couple honeymooned at family homes in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, then returned to Philadelphia to take residence at Arnold's military headquarters in the Masters-Penn mansion.\n\n==Espionage between the Arnolds and Major John Andr\u00e9==\nAs a newlywed, Peggy may have had contact with her \"dear friend\" [[John Andr\u00e9|Major Andr\u00e9]], who had become [[Henry Clinton (British Army officer, born 1730)|General Clinton]]'s spy chief. She and Arnold also had close friends who were either actively Loyalist or sympathetic to that cause. Some historians believe that Peggy Shippen instigated the correspondence between Arnold and Andr\u00e9 and sent military secrets to the British before her wedding. Other suspects in Arnold's subsequent espionage ring with Andr\u00e9 were Loyalists Rev. [[Jonathan Odell]] and Joseph Stansbury.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.si.umich.edu/spies/people.html|title=People of the Revolution|website=Si.umich.edu|accessdate=10 September 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060519012550/http://www.si.umich.edu/spies/people.html|archivedate=19 May 2006}}</ref>\n\nArnold hired Joseph Stansbury to initiate communications in May 1779, offering his services to the British not long after he married.  General Clinton gave Major Andr\u00e9 orders to pursue the possibility, and secret communications began between Andr\u00e9 and Arnold.  The messages that they exchanged were sometimes transmitted through Peggy's actions; letters written in her hand also include [[Arnold Cipher|coded communications]] written by Benedict Arnold in [[invisible ink]].\n\n[[File:ArnoldCipherLetter.jpeg|thumb|200px|right|Image of a coded letter: Peggy Shippen Arnold's handwriting is interspersed with [[Arnold Cipher|coded writing]] in Benedict Arnold's hand; Arnold's writing would have been in [[invisible ink]]]]\nEnraged by his treatment in Philadelphia, General Arnold resigned his command there in March 1779. Pursuant to the secret communications with the British, he sought and obtained the command of [[West Point]], a critical American defense post in the highlands of the [[Hudson River]].  Peggy and their infant son Edward Shippen Arnold (born 19 Mar 1780) joined him there in a home on the Hudson two miles south of West Point. General Arnold systematically weakened the defenses of West Point with the intent of making it easier for the British to capture.\n\nOn Thursday, September 21, 1780, General Arnold met with Andr\u00e9 on the shores of the Hudson River and gave him documents and maps about the fortifications at West Point in anticipation of the British capture of that site. On Saturday, September 23, Andr\u00e9 was arrested as he rode towards British territory, the documents were discovered, and the plot was exposed.  On Monday, September 25, Arnold received a note announcing Andr\u00e9's capture and possession of treasonous papers and maps. That same morning, General [[George Washington]] was planning to meet Arnold at his home, two miles south of West Point. Arnold first dashed upstairs to Peggy, then fled, eventually reaching HMS ''Vulture'' on the Hudson River.{{sfn|Stuart|2013|pages=94\u201396}}\n\nPeggy Shippen Arnold was then dressing in anticipation of hosting a breakfast for Washington and his party. Possibly based on a brief discussion with her husband, she pretended hysteria in order to falsely convince General Washington and his staff that she had nothing to do with her husband's betrayal.  The delay caused by her histrionics may have allowed Arnold time to escape, leaving Peggy with their infant son.  Fearing for her safety, she traveled to Philadelphia to stay with her family.  She also played the innocent when asked about her husband, even though she knew his whereabouts.  Philadelphia authorities soon found a letter from Andr\u00e9 to Peggy written from British-occupied New York\u2014the so-called \"millinery letter\"\u2014and seized upon it as proof that Arnold's wife had been complicitous in the treason. That led the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania to banish her from Philadelphia. In November 1780, her father escorted Peggy and her infant son to the shores of the Hudson where she boarded a boat to New York City to join Arnold.{{sfn|Stuart|2013|page=112}}<ref>{{cite book | last = Brandt | first = Clare | title = The Man in the Mirror: A Life of Benedict Arnold | publisher = Random House | location = New York | year = 1994 | isbn = 0-679-40106-7 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/maninmirrorlifeo00bran/page/234 234\u2013238] | url = https://archive.org/details/maninmirrorlifeo00bran/page/234 }}</ref>\n\nAfter a military trial, Major Andr\u00e9 was condemned to death as a common spy and was hanged at [[Tappan, New York]].  He was later re-interred in London's [[Westminster Abbey]].{{sfn|Randall|1990|pages=566\u2013569}}\n\n==After the Revolution==\nHostilities appeared to be winding down in North America after Cornwallis' [[Siege of Yorktown|surrender at Yorktown]] in October 1781, and the Arnolds left for [[London]] on December 15, 1781\u2014including their second child James Robertson (born in August)\u2014arriving January 22, 1782.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Benedict Arnold: The Aftermath of Treason, American Heritage Magazine, October 1967 Volume 18, Issue 6</ref>\n\nPeggy was initially welcomed warmly in England, as was her husband; she was presented at court to the queen on February 10, 1782 by [[Lady Amherst]]. [[Queen Charlotte]] awarded her an annuity of 100 [[pound sterling]] for the maintenance of her children, including those not yet born. King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] also presented her with \u00a3350 \"obtained for her services, which were meritorious.\"{{sfn|Stuart|2013|pp=135, 112}} A girl (Margaret) and a boy (George), born in 1783 and 1784 respectively, died in infancy while the Arnolds lived in London.\n\nArnold left for a business opportunity in 1784 and sent to Connecticut for his three sons Benedict, Richard, and Henry (by his first wife) to join him in [[Saint John, New Brunswick]].  During Arnold's stay in New Brunswick, Peggy Shippen Arnold gave birth to their third surviving child Sophia Matilda Arnold, while her husband may have fathered an illegitimate child (John Sage) in New Brunswick.<ref>{{harvnb|Randall|1990|page=613}} Many historians suggest an Arnold liaison in New Brunswick, although Canadian historian Barry Wilson notes the weakness of the traditional account that Sage is the product of such a liaison. Sage's gravestone indicates that he was born on April 14, 1786, a date roughly confirmed by Benedict Arnold's will, which stated that Sage was 14 when Arnold wrote it in 1800. Arnold arrived in New Brunswick in December 1785, so Sage's mother could not have been from there. Wilson believes that the explanation most consistent with the available documentation is that Sage was either the result of a liaison before Arnold left England, or that he was Arnold's grandson by one of his older children. Wilson, pp. 231\u2013233</ref> Peggy sailed to Saint John to join her husband in 1787, leaving her two older sons with a private family in London; in New Brunswick, Peggy gave birth to son George in 1787; their last child William Fitch was born in 1794 after their return to London.\n\nIn 1789, she returned briefly to Philadelphia, accompanied by her infant son George and a maid, to visit with her parents and family. She was treated coldly by Philadelphians in spite of her father's considerable influence.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Peggy sailed back to New Brunswick with young George in the spring of 1790, and from there returned to England with Arnold in late December 1791. Their departure was unhappy, with mobs gathering on their property to protest against them and calling them \"traitors.\"\n\nAfter Arnold died in 1801, Peggy auctioned the contents of their home, the home itself, and many of her personal possessions to pay off his debts.  She died in London in 1804, reportedly of cancer, and was buried with her husband at [[St. Mary's Church, Battersea|St. Mary's Church]] in [[Battersea]] on August 25, 1804.\n\n==Role in conspiracy==\n\nHistorians are unanimous in her complicity\u2014and she accepted a reward for her services from the king. Her family in Philadelphia denied everything. Arnold's biographer [[Nathaniel Philbrick]] argues:\n:Peggy Shippen... did have a significant role in the plot. She exerted powerful influence on her husband, who is said to have been his own man but who actually was swayed by his staff and certainly by his wife. Peggy came from a loyalist family in Philadelphia; she had many ties to the British. She ... was the conduit for information to the British.<ref>Interview with Philbrick in Michael Dolan, \"Ero And Villain,\" ''American History'' (Aug 2016) 51#3 pp 12-13.</ref>\n\n[[James Parton]], a biographer of [[Aaron Burr]], published an account in the 19th century, after all of the principal actors had died, implying that Peggy Shippen Arnold had manipulated or persuaded Benedict to change sides. The basis for the claim was interviews that he conducted with Theodosia Prevost, the widow of [[Jacques Marcus Prevost]] who later married Burr, and notes later made by Burr. While en route to Philadelphia from West Point in 1780, Peggy Shippen Arnold visited with Prevost at [[Paramus, New Jersey]]. According to Parton, she unburdened herself to Prevost, claiming that she \"was heartily tired of all the theatricals she was exhibiting\", referring to her histrionics at West Point.{{sfn|Randall|1990|page=571}} According to Burr's notes, Shippen Arnold \"was disgusted with the American cause\" and \"through unceasing perseverance, she had ultimately brought the general into an arrangement to surrender West Point.\"{{sfn|Randall|1990|page=571}}\n\nWhen these allegations were first published, the Shippen family countered with allegations of improper behavior on Burr's part.  They claimed that Burr rode with Peggy Shippen Arnold in the carriage to Philadelphia after her stay with Mrs. Prevost, and that he fabricated the allegation because she refused advances that he made during the ride.{{sfn|Randall|1990|page=571}} Arnold biographer [[Willard Sterne Randall]] suggests that Burr's version has a more authentic ring to it: first, Burr waited until all were dead before it could be published; and second, Burr was not in the carriage on the ride to Philadelphia.  Randall also notes that ample further evidence has since come to light showing that Peggy Shippen Arnold played an active role in the conspiracy.{{sfn|Randall|1990|page=572}} British documents from 1792 show that Mrs. Arnold was paid \u00a3350 for handling secret dispatches.<ref>Willard N.
