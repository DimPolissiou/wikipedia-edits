After having attended the reform sessions of a number of monasteries, Henry summoned his army at [[Stablo]], In July he joined with contingents at Goslar and deployed his entire army at [[Regensburg]]. He set out on 13&nbsp;August and was soon ambushed in the passes of the [[Bohemian Forest]] and forced to retreat with heavy losses at the [[Battle at Br\u016fdek]]. After the release of a large number of Bohemian hostages, including Bretislavs' son, did Henry procure the release of his prisoners and peace was established. Henry retreated hastily, avoided all grand arrayal and concluded the defeat. On his return to Germany, he appointed [[Pope Clement II|Suidger]] [[bishop of Bamberg]], the future Pope Clement&nbsp;II.<ref name=\"Steinhoff1865\"/>\n\nIn 1040, [[Peter, King of Hungary|Peter of Hungary]] was overthrown by [[Samuel Aba of Hungary|Samuel Aba]] and fled to Germany, where Henry welcomed him despite former enmities. Bretislav was now deprived of his former ally, upon which Henry prepared another campaign into Bohemia. On 15 August, almost exactly one year after his last expedition he set out once more, was victorious and signed a peace treaty with Bretislav at Regensburg.<ref name=\"Steinhoff1865\"/>\n[[File:Konrad und seine Gemahlin Gisela.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Conrad II and his wife Gisela kneel in front of the ''Majestas Domini'', [[Golden Gospels of Henry III|Codex Aureus Escorialensis]], around 1045/46, Madrid, Biblioteca del monasterio de San Lorenzo de El Escorial,]]\nHenry spent Christmas 1041 at [[Strasbourg]], received emissaries from the Duchy of Burgundy, where he travelled at new year and settled administrative and judicial matters. On the road near [[Basel]] he learnt of Hungarian raids into Bavaria and bestowed the duchy to a certain [[Henry VII, Duke of Bavaria|Henry VII]], a relative of the last independent duke. At Cologne, Henry summoned the royal princes, who unanimously declared war on Hungary. After he had sent a wedding delegation to [[Agnes de Poitou]] he set out in September 1042 and successfully subdued the western territories of Hungary. Aba fled to his eastern estates, as Henry installed a cousin as steward, who was however quickly removed after the emperor had left.\n\nAfter Christmas at his chosen imperial residence Goslar, he received foreign guests. Duke Bretislav appeared in person, a [[Kiev]]an marriage embassy was dismissed and the ambassadors of [[Casimir I of Poland]] were rejected as the duke did not show up in person. Henry left for the French border near [[Ivois]], in order to meet King [[Henry I of France]], most likely to discuss the impending marriage to the princess of [[Aquitaine]]. Henry next returned to Hungary and forced Aba to recognize the [[Danube|Danubian]] territories, a former donation of [[Stephen I of Hungary]], ''pro causa amicitiae'' (for friendship's sake). These territories had been ceded to Hungary after Conrad II's defeat of 1030. This border remained in place between Hungary and [[Austria]] until 1920.\n\n===Promotion of Speyer===\n\nGisela, Henry's mother, died in March 1043. She was solemnly buried in Speyer. The king appeared barefoot, in tears, and penitent robe at the funeral, his arms crossed, threw himself on the ground in front of the crowd and moved everyone to tears.  With Henry's emulation of Christian humble self-denial, he intended prove his ability to hold pious kingship. Historians refer since to the period of the ''\"Christomimetic royalty\"''. Henry promoted Speyer far more than his father Conrad. Shortly before leaving for Italy, he endowed the church with a magnificently illustrated gospel book, called the ''[[Golden Gospels of Henry III|Codex Aureus Escorialensis]]'', also known as the Speyer Gospel. The Dome of Speyer was gradually extended during the following years and a large burial sector was created for future rulers and royal continuity.<ref name=\"Reuter2006\">{{cite book|author=Timothy Reuter|title=Medieval Polities and Modern Mentalities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oGsN0Xbo-ZoC&pg=PA98|date=2 November 2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-45954-9|pages=98\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Arnold2014\">{{cite book|author=John H.

After he had taken a number of castles, lack of supplies forced him to leave. He garrisoned the ducal castles and cities to prevent any incursions and raids by Godfrey and left for Burgundy.

When Henry arrived, Reginald and Gerold [[County of Geneva|Count of Geneva]] paid homage and  Burgundy was subsequently incorporated into the empire.<ref name=\"Schneidm\u00fcllerWeinfurter2003\">{{cite book|author1=Bernd Schneidm\u00fcller|author2=Stefan Weinfurter|title=Die deutschen Herrscher des Mittelalters: historische Portraits von Heinrich I. bis Maximilian I.

In Goslar he invested [[Otto II, Duke of Swabia|Otto]] with the duchy of Swabia, the [[Count palatine]], [[Henry I, Count Palatine|Henry I]] with the [[Duchy of Lorraine|Lorraine]] and [[Baldwin VI of Flanders|Baldwin]] with the [[Margraviate of Antwerp]]. During the preparations of the jaunt to Hungary where Henry had intended to spend Pentecost with King Peter, a wooden floor collapsed in a residence where [[Bruno, Bishop of W\u00fcrzburg]] was killed. In Hungary, Peter presented Henry with the ''Golden Lance'' and pledged an oath of fealty among his nobles. The crown of Hungary was bestowed on Peter in perpetuity and the kingdoms of Germany and Hungary were at peace. In July, Godfrey surrendered and was imprisoned at [[Giebichenstein]].\n\n===War in Lorraine===\nHenry fell ill at [[Tribur]] in October, as Henry of Bavaria and Otto of Swabia already chose Otto's nephew and successor in the [[Count palatine]], [[Henry I, Count Palatine|Henry I]] of Lorraine as  successor. Henry III recovered, but remained heirless. In early 1046, Henry's old advisor, Eckard of Meissen, died, leaving Meissen to Henry. He bestowed it on [[Wilhelm IV of Weimar-Orlam\u00fcnde|William]], count of [[Orlam\u00fcnde]].<ref name=ordn/>\n\nHenry then moved to Lower Lorraine, where Gothelo II had just died and [[Dirk IV of Holland]] had seized [[Flushing, Netherlands|Flushing]]. Henry personally led a campaign against Count Dirk and recovered Flushing. He gave it to [[Bernold, Bishop of Utrecht]], and returned to Aachen to celebrate Pentecost and to decide on the fate of Lorraine. Henry restored Godfrey, but transferred the county of Verdun to the bishop of the city, which angered the duke. Henry bestowed the lower duchy to [[Frederick, Duke of Lower Lorraine]] and  appointed [[Adalbert of Bremen|Adalbert]] [[archbishop of Bremen]].\n\nThe right of a German court to try an Italian bishop was considered very controversial. The problem culminated in the [[Investiture Controversy]] that overshadowed the reigns of Henry's son and grandson. Henry moved on to Saxony and held imperial courts at [[Quedlinburg]], [[Merseburg]] (in June) and Meissen, where he appointed his daughter Beatrice abbess and ended the strife between [[Siemomys\u0142, Duke of Pomerania]] and [[Casimir I the Restorer|Casimir of Poland]].<ref name=bio/>\n\n===Imperial coronation===\n[[Image:Heinrich III. sieht den neuen Stern \u00fcber der Stadt Tivoli (Tyburtina).jpg|thumb|Henry before [[Tivoli, Italy|Tivoli]] in a 15th-century manuscript]]\n[[File:Pope Clement II.jpg|thumb|[[Pope Clement II]], illustration in ''The Lives and Times of the Popes'', Chevalier Artaud de Monto]]\nHenry summoned the senior princes of the empire and departed to Italy. His ally, Aribert of Milan, had recently died and the Milanese citizens had chosen [[Guido, Archbishop of Milan|Guido]] to succeed him. In Rome, the three popes [[Benedict IX]], [[Sylvester III]], and [[Pope Gregory VI|Gregory VI]] contested the pontifical honours.\n\nBenedict was a [[Tusculum|Tusculan]] who had previously renounced the throne, Sylvester a [[Crescentii|Crescentian]], and Gregory was a reformer ([[Simony|simoniac]]). Henry marched to [[Verona]] and [[Pavia]], where he held court and dispensed justice. He moved on to [[Sutri]] and held [[Council of Sutri|a second court]] on 20 December 1046 where he deposed all three papal candidates. In Rome he held a synod, declared all Roman priests unfit for office and as Adalbert of Bremen refused the honour, Henry appointed [[Pope Clement II|Suidger of Bamberg]], who was acclaimed by the people and clergy. He adopted the name [[Pope Clement II|Clement II]].<ref name=\"Stroll2011\">{{cite book|author=Mary Stroll|title=Popes and Antipopes: The Politics of Eleventh Century Church Reform|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RhLKFV63fYwC&pg=PA10|date=9 December 2011|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-21701-0|pages=10\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"ThorndikeShotwell1928\">{{cite book|author1=Lynn Thorndike|author2=James Thomson Shotwell|title=The History of Medieval Europe p.285|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xyfGDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1|year=1928|publisher=Dalcassian Publishing Company|pages=285\u2013|id=GGKEY:TY4HYGTG9WL}}</ref>\n\nOn Christmas Day 1046, Clement was consecrated, and Henry and Agnes crowned emperor and empress. The Roman citizen awarded Henry the ''Golden Chain of the Patriciate'' and elvated him to ''[[Patrikios|patricius]]''. Henry visited [[Frascati]], the capital of the [[counts of Tusculum]] and seized all castles of the Crescentii family. Joined by the pope he ventured to southern Italy and reverted most of his fathers policies.<ref name=ordn>{{cite web |url=https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/vuf/article/view/17742 |title=Ordnungskonfigurationen im Konflikt Das Beispiel Kaiser Heinrichs III. |publisher=  Uni Heidelberg  |author=Stefan Weinfurter |date=  |accessdate=February 16, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nAt [[Capua]], Henry was received by Prince [[Guaimar IV of Salerno]] and [[Prince of Capua|Capua]]. However, Henry returned Capua to the twice-deprived Prince [[Pandulf IV of Capua|Pandulf IV]], a highly unpopular choice. Guaimar had been acclaimed as [[Duke of Apulia and Calabria]] by the [[Italo-Normans|Norman]] mercenaries under [[William Iron Arm]] and his brother [[Drogo of Hauteville]].\n\nIn return, Guaimar had recognized the conquests of the Normans and invested William as his vassal with the [[Count|comital]] title. Henry made Drogo, William's successor in Apulia, a direct vassal of the imperial crown. He did likewise to [[Ranulf Drengot]], the count of [[Aversa]], who had been a vassal of Guaimar as Prince of Capua. Thus, Guaimar was deprived of his greatest vassals, his principality split in two, and his greatest enemy reinstated. These decisions  made Henry unpopular among the Lombards and [[Benevento]], although a papal vassal, would not approve of him. The Italian circuit was completed when he arrived at Verona in May 1047.<ref name=bio/>\n\n===Henry's appointments===\nUpon his return to Germany, Henry assigned the offices that had been left vacant. He transferred his last personal duchy to [[Welf, Duke of Carinthia|Welf]] duke of Carinthia, made his Italian [[chancellor]] Hunfried [[Bishop of Ravenna]] appointed several other chairs, installed Guido in [[Piacenza]], his chaplain Theodoric in Verdun, the provost Herman of Speyer in [[Strasbourg]] and his German chancellor Theodoric in Constance. The important Lorrainian bishoprics of [[Metz]] and [[Trier]] received respectively [[Adalbero III of Luxembourg|Adalbero]] and [[Eberhard, Archbishop of Trier|Eberhard]], a chaplain.<ref name=\"Steinhoff1865\"/>\n\nHenry was at Metz in July 1047 when a latent insurrection rose in rebellion. Godfrey was now allied with Baldwin of Flanders, his son (the margrave of Antwerp), Dirk of Holland, and [[Herman, Count of Hainaut]]. Henry gathered an army and went north, where he gave Adalbert of Bremen Godfrey's former lands and oversaw the trial by combat of Thietmar, the brother of [[Bernard II, Duke of Saxony]], accused of plotting to kill the king. Bernard, an enemy of Adalbert, was now clearly on Henry's bad side. Henry made peace with the new king of Hungary, [[Andrew I of Hungary|Andrew I]], and moved into the [[Netherlands]]. At Flushing, he was defeated by Dirk. The Hollanders sacked [[Charlemagne]]'s palace at [[Nijmegen]] and burnt Verdun. Godfrey then performed a public penance and assisted in the reconstruction of Verdun.<ref name=\"Steinhoff1865\"/>\n\nThe rebels besieged [[Li\u00e8ge (city)|Li\u00e8ge]], that was stoutly defended by Bishop [[Wazo]]. Henry gave Upper Lorraine to one [[Adalbert, Duke of Lorraine|Adalbert]] and left. The pope had died in the meantime and Henry chose Poppo of Brixen to succeed him, who adopted the name [[Damasus II]]. Henry gave Bavaria to one [[Cuno, Duke of Bavaria|Cuno]] and, at Ulm in January 1048, Swabia to [[Otto III, Duke of Swabia|Otto of Schweinfurt]], called ''the White''. Henry met Henry of France again, probably at Ivois in October and at Christmas, envoys from Rome came to seek a new pope, Damasus having died. Henry's most enduring papal selection was Bruno of Toul, who took office as [[Leo IX]], under whom the Church would be divided between East and West. Henry's final appointment of this long spate was a successor to Adalbert in Lorraine. For this, he appointed [[Gerard, Duke of Lorraine|Gerard of Chatenoy]], a relative of Adalbert and Henry himself.<ref name=\"Jaeger2013\">{{cite book|author=C.

Dirk of Holland was defeated and killed. Adalbert of Bremen managed a peace with Bernard of Saxony and negotiated a treaty with the missionary monarch [[Sweyn II of Denmark]]. With the assistance of Sweyn and [[Edward the Confessor]] of England, whose enemies Baldwin had harboured, Baldwin of Flanders was harassed by sea and unable to escape the onslaught of the imperial army. At Cologne, the pope excommunicated Godfrey and Baldwin. The former abandoned his allies and was imprisoned by the emperor again. Baldwin also gave in under Henry's pressure. Finally, the war had ended in the Low Countries and Lorraine.<ref name=wein>{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/31120508/Stefan_Weinfurter_Das_Jahrhundert_der_Salier_1024-1125_ |title=  Das Jahrhundert der Salier (1024-1125) | publisher =  Academia  |date=   |author=Stefan Weinfurter  |accessdate= February 16, 2020  }}</ref>\n\n==Final years==\n\nIn 1051, Henry undertook a third Hungarian campaign but suffered a major defeat. His troops fled the battlefield over a range of hills still called \"V\u00e9rtes\" (\"Armoured\") because discarded armour has been found there for centuries. In Lower Lorraine  [[Lambert II, Count of Leuven|Lambert, Count of Louvain]], and Richildis, widow of Herman of Mons and new bride of Baldwin of Antwerp, caused trouble. Godfrey was released and given Lower Lorraine, to safeguard the unstable peace attained two years before.\n\nIn 1052, Henry undertook a fourth campaign against Hungary, and besieged [[Bratislava|Pressburg]] without success, as the Hungarians sank his supply ships on the Danube river. Henry was unable to continue his campaign and in fact never tried again. Henry did send a Swabian army to assist Leo in Italy, but he recalled it quickly. At Christmas 1052, Cuno of Bavaria was summoned to Merseburg and deposed by a small council of princes for his conflict with [[Gebhard III, Bishop of Regensburg]]. Cuno revolted.<ref name=\"Steinhoff1865\"/>\n\n===Final wars in Germany===\nOn 26 June 1053, at Tribur, the young [[Emperor Henry IV|Henry]], born 11 November 1050, was elected king of Germany. Andrew of Hungary almost made peace, but Cuno convinced him otherwise. Henry appointed his young son duke of Bavaria and went to deal with the ongoing insurrection. Henry sent another army to assist Leo in the [[Mezzogiorno]] against the Normans he himself had confirmed in their conquests as his vassal. Leo, without assistance from Guaimar (distanced from Henry since 1047), was defeated at the [[Battle of Civitate]] on 18 June 1053 by [[Humphrey of Hauteville|Humphrey]], Count of Apulia. [[Robert Guiscard]], his younger brother; and Prince [[Richard I of Capua]]. The Swabians were cut to pieces.<ref name=\"Schneidm\u00fcllerWeinfurter2003\"/>\n\nIn 1054, Henry traveled north to deal with the bellicose Casimir of Poland. He transferred [[Silesia]] from Bretislav to Casimir. Bretislaus nevertheless remained loyal to the end. Henry turned westwards and crowned his young son at Aachen on July 17 and then marched into Flanders, as the two Baldwins had rebelled again. John of Arras, who had seized [[Cambrai]] before, had been forced out by Baldwin of Flanders and so turned to the Emperor. In return for inducing [[Liutpert, Bishop of Cambrai]], to give John the castle, John would lead Henry through Flanders. The Flemish campaign was a success, but Liutpert could not be convinced.\n\nBretislav, who had regained Silesia in a short war, died in 1054. The margrave [[Adalbert of Austria]], however, successfully resisted the depredations of Cuno and the raids of the king of Hungary. Henry could thus direct his attention elsewhere than rebellions for once. He returned to Goslar, the city where his son had been born and which he had raised to imperial and ecclesiastic grandeur with his palace and church reforms. He passed Christmas there and appointed [[Pope Victor II|Gebhard of Eichstedt]] as the next holder of the Petrine see, with the name Victor II. He was the last of Henry's four German popes.<ref name=ordn/>\n\n===Preparing Italy and Germany for his death===\n[[File:Reichsapfel Heinrich III.JPG|thumb|Imperial orb from the burial inventory of Henry III]]\n[[File:SargHeinrichDrei.jpg|thumb|Sarcophagus of Henry III in Goslar]]\nIn 1055, Henry turned south, to Italy again, for [[Boniface&nbsp;III of Tuscany]], ever an imperial ally, had died, and his widow, [[Beatrice of Bar]] had married Godfrey of Lorraine (1054). First, however, he gave his old hostage, [[Spytihn\u011bv II of Bohemia|Spitignev]], the son of Bretislaus to the Bohemians as duke. Spitignev did homage and Bohemia remained securely, loyally, and happily within the Imperial fold. By Easter, Henry had arrived in [[Mantua]]. He held several courts, one at [[Roncaglia (Piacenza)|Roncaglia]], where, a century later (1158), [[Frederick Barbarossa]] held a [[Diet of Roncaglia|far more important diet]], sent out his ''[[missi dominici]]'' to establish order. Godfrey, ostensibly the reason for the visit, was not well received by the people and returned to Flanders. Henry met the pope at [[Florence]] and arrested Beatrice for marrying a traitor, and her daughter [[Matilda of Tuscany|Matilda]], later to be such an enemy of Henry's son. The young [[Frederick of Tuscany]], son of Beatrice, refused to come to Florence and died within days.<ref name=\"Schneidm\u00fcllerWeinfurter2003\"/>\n\nHenry returned and at Christmas 1055 he arranged the subsequent marriage of his successor. In [[Zurich]], the heir to the throne, [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]], was engaged to [[Bertha of Savoy|Bertha]] of Turin of the [[House of Savoy]].<ref name=\"Houts2019\">{{cite book|author=Elisabeth van Houts|title=Married Life in the Middle Ages, 900-1300|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZuCGDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT296|date=31 January 2019|publisher=OUP inrichOxford|isbn=978-0-19-251974-0|pages=47\u2013}}</ref>\n\nHenry entered a Germany in turmoil. A staunch ally against Cuno in Bavaria, Gebhard of Regensburg, was implicated in a plot against the king along with Cuno and Welf of Carinthia. Sources diverge here: some claim only that the retainers of the princes plotted the undoing of the king. Whatever the case, it all came to naught, and Cuno died of [[Bubonic plague|plague]], and Welf soon following him to the grave. Baldwin of Flanders and Godfrey were at it again, besieging Antwerp, and they were defeated again. Henry's reign was clearly changing in character: old foes were dead or dying and old friends as well.<ref name=ordn/>\n\nHerman of Cologne died. Henry appointed his confessor, [[Anno II, archbishop of Cologne|Anno]], as Herman's successor. Henry of France, so long eyeing Lorraine greedily, met for a third time with the emperor at Ivois in May 1056. The French king, not renowned for his tactical or strategic prowess, but admirable for his personal valour on the field, had a heated debate with the German king and challenged him to single combat. Henry fled at night from this meeting. Once in Germany again, Godfrey made his final peace, and Henry went to the northeast to deal with a Slav uprising after the death of William of Meissen. He fell ill on the way and took to bed. He freed Beatrice and Matilda and had those with him [[designation (monarchy)|swear allegiance]] to the young Henry, whom he commended the pope, present.\n\nOn 5 October, not yet forty, Henry died at [[Bodfeld]], the imperial hunting lodge in the [[Harz Mountains]].{{sfn|Whitney|1968|p=31}} His heart was transferred to Goslar and his body to [[Speyer]], to rest next to his father's in the family vault of the [[Speyer Cathedral|cathedral of Speyer]]. Henry had been one of the most powerful of the Holy Roman Emperors. His authority as king in Burgundy, Germany, and Italy was only rarely questioned, his power over the church was at the root of what the reformers he sponsored later fought against in his son, and his achievement in binding to the empire her tributaries was clear. Nevertheless, his reign is often pronounced a failure in that he apparently left problems far beyond the capacities of his successors to handle. The [[Investiture Controversy]] was largely the result of his church politics, though his popemaking gave the Roman diocese to the reform party.<ref name=\"Giesebrecht1841\">{{cite book|author=Wilhelm von Giesebrecht|title=Annales Altahenses: eine Quellenschrift zur Geschichte des eilften Jahrhunderts aus Fragmenten und Excerpten hergestellt|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_fv1BAAAAYAAJ|year=1841|publisher=Duncker und Humblot|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_fv1BAAAAYAAJ/page/n219 125]\u2013}}</ref> He united all the great duchies save Saxony to himself at one point or another but gave them all away.

After having attended the reform sessions of a number of monasteries, Henry summoned his army at [[Stablo]], In July he joined with contingents at Goslar and deployed his entire army at [[Regensburg]]. He set out on 13&nbsp;August and was soon ambushed in the passes of the [[Bohemian Forest]] and forced to retreat with heavy losses at the [[Battle at Br\u016fdek]]. After the release of a large number of Bohemian hostages, including Bretislavs' son, did Henry procure the release of his prisoners and peace was established. Henry retreated hastily, avoided all grand arrayal and concluded the defeat. On his return to Germany, he appointed [[Pope Clement II|Suidger]] [[bishop of Bamberg]], the future Pope Clement&nbsp;II.<ref name=\"Steinhoff1865\"/>\n\nIn 1040, [[Peter, King of Hungary|Peter of Hungary]] was overthrown by [[Samuel Aba of Hungary|Samuel Aba]] and fled to Germany, where Henry welcomed him despite former enmities. Bretislav was now deprived of his former ally, upon which Henry prepared another campaign into Bohemia. On 15 August, almost exactly one year after his last expedition he set out once more, was victorious and signed a peace treaty with Bretislav at Regensburg.<ref name=\"Steinhoff1865\"/>\n[[File:Konrad und seine Gemahlin Gisela.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Conrad II and his wife Gisela kneel in front of the ''Majestas Domini'', [[Golden Gospels of Henry III|Codex Aureus Escorialensis]], around 1045/46, Madrid, Biblioteca del monasterio de San Lorenzo de El Escorial,]]\nHenry spent Christmas 1041 at [[Strasbourg]], received emissaries from the Duchy of Burgundy, where he travelled at new year and settled administrative and judicial matters. On the road near [[Basel]] he learnt of Hungarian raids into Bavaria and bestowed the duchy to a certain [[Henry VII, Duke of Bavaria|Henry VII]], a relative of the last independent duke. At Cologne, Henry summoned the royal princes, who unanimously declared war on Hungary. After he had sent a wedding delegation to [[Agnes de Poitou]] he set out in September 1042 and successfully subdued the western territories of Hungary. Aba fled to his eastern estates, as Henry installed a cousin as steward, who was however quickly removed after the emperor had left.\n\nAfter Christmas at his chosen imperial residence Goslar, he received foreign guests. Duke Bretislav appeared in person, a [[Kiev]]an marriage embassy was dismissed and the ambassadors of [[Casimir I of Poland]] were rejected as the duke did not show up in person. Henry left for the French border near [[Ivois]], in order to meet King [[Henry I of France]], most likely to discuss the impending marriage to the princess of [[Aquitaine]]. Henry next returned to Hungary and forced Aba to recognize the [[Danube|Danubian]] territories, a former donation of [[Stephen I of Hungary]], ''pro causa amicitiae'' (for friendship's sake). These territories had been ceded to Hungary after Conrad II's defeat of 1030. This border remained in place between Hungary and [[Austria]] until 1920.\n\n===Promotion of Speyer===\n\nGisela, Henry's mother, died in March 1043. She was solemnly buried in Speyer. The king appeared barefoot, in tears and penitent robe at the funeral, his arms crossed, threw himself on the ground in front of the crowd and moved everyone to tears.  With Henry's emulation of Christian humble self-denial, he intended prove his ability to hold pious kingship. Historians refer since to the period of the ''\"Christomimetic royalty\"''. Henry promoted Speyer far more than his father Conrad. Shortly before leaving for Italy, he endowed the church with a magnificently illustrated gospel book, called the ''[[Golden Gospels of Henry III|Codex Aureus Escorialensis]]'', also known as the Speyer Gospel. The Dome of Speyer was gradually extended during the following years and a large burial sector was created for future rulers and royal continuity.<ref name=\"Reuter2006\">{{cite book|author=Timothy Reuter|title=Medieval Polities and Modern Mentalities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oGsN0Xbo-ZoC&pg=PA98|date=2 November 2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-45954-9|pages=98\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Arnold2014\">{{cite book|author=John H.

Henry wintered at [[Speyer]] and prepared for the Lorraine campaign of 1045.\n\nIn early 1045, Henry entered Lorraine at the head of an army, besieged and conquered Godfrey's castle of [[Schlo\u00dfb\u00f6ckelheim|B\u00f6ckelheim]] (near [[Kreuznach]]). After he had taken a number of castles, lack of supplies forced him to leave. He garrisoned the ducal castles and cities to prevent any incursions and raids by Godfrey and left for Burgundy. Godfrey had stirred up rebellions in Burgundy by creating conflicts between the imperialist faction and the domestic royal faction, which supported an independent Burgundy. Louis [[County of Montb\u00e9liard|Count of Montb\u00e9liard]], challenged and defeated [[Reginald I, Count of Burgundy]]. When Henry arrived, Reginald and Gerold [[County of Geneva|Count of Geneva]] paid homage and  Burgundy was subsequently incorporated into the empire.<ref name=\"Schneidm\u00fcllerWeinfurter2003\">{{cite book|author1=Bernd Schneidm\u00fcller|author2=Stefan Weinfurter|title=Die deutschen Herrscher des Mittelalters: historische Portraits von Heinrich I. bis Maximilian I.

In Goslar he invested [[Otto II, Duke of Swabia|Otto]] with the duchy of Swabia, the [[Count palatine]], [[Henry I, Count Palatine|Henry I]] with the [[Duchy of Lorraine|Lorraine]] and [[Baldwin VI of Flanders|Baldwin]] with the [[Margraviate of Antwerp]]. During the preparations of the jaunt to Hungary where Henry had intended to spend Pentecost with King Peter, a wooden floor collapsed in a residence where [[Bruno, Bishop of W\u00fcrzburg]] was killed. In Hungary, Peter presented Henry with the ''Golden Lance'' and pledged an oath of fealty among his nobles. The crown of Hungary was bestowed on Peter in perpetuity and the kingdoms of Germany and Hungary were at peace. In July, Godfrey surrendered and was imprisoned at [[Giebichenstein]].\n\n===War in Lorraine===\nHenry fell ill at [[Tribur]] in October, as Henry of Bavaria and Otto of Swabia already chose Otto's nephew and successor in the [[Count palatine]], [[Henry I, Count Palatine|Henry I]] of Lorraine as  successor. Henry III recovered, but remained heirless. In early 1046, Henry's old advisor, Eckard of Meissen, died, leaving Meissen to Henry. He bestowed it on [[Wilhelm IV of Weimar-Orlam\u00fcnde|William]], count of [[Orlam\u00fcnde]].<ref name=ordn/>\n\nHenry then moved to Lower Lorraine, where Gothelo II had just died and [[Dirk IV of Holland]] had seized [[Flushing, Netherlands|Flushing]]. Henry personally led a campaign against Count Dirk and recovered Flushing. He gave it to [[Bernold, Bishop of Utrecht]], and returned to Aachen to celebrate Pentecost and to decide on the fate of Lorraine. Henry restored Godfrey, but transferred the county of Verdun to the bishop of the city, which angered the duke. Henry bestowed the lower duchy to [[Frederick, Duke of Lower Lorraine]] and  appointed [[Adalbert of Bremen|Adalbert]] [[archbishop of Bremen]].\n\nThe right of a German court to try an Italian bishop was considered very controversial. The problem culminated in the [[Investiture Controversy]] that overshadowed the reigns of Henry's son and grandson. Henry moved on to Saxony and held imperial courts at [[Quedlinburg]], [[Merseburg]] (in June) and Meissen, where he appointed his daughter Beatrice abbess and ended the strife between [[Siemomys\u0142, Duke of Pomerania]] and [[Casimir I the Restorer|Casimir of Poland]].<ref name=bio/>\n\n===Imperial coronation===\n[[Image:Heinrich III. sieht den neuen Stern \u00fcber der Stadt Tivoli (Tyburtina).jpg|thumb|Henry before [[Tivoli, Italy|Tivoli]] in a 15th-century manuscript]]\n[[File:Pope Clement II.jpg|thumb|[[Pope Clement II]], illustration in ''The Lives and Times of the Popes'', Chevalier Artaud de Monto]]\nHenry summoned the senior princes of the empire and departed to Italy. His ally, Aribert of Milan, had recently died and the Milanese citizens had chosen [[Guido, Archbishop of Milan|Guido]] to succeed him. In Rome, the three popes [[Benedict IX]], [[Sylvester III]], and [[Pope Gregory VI|Gregory VI]] contested the pontifical honours.\n\nBenedict was a [[Tusculum|Tusculan]] who had previously renounced the throne, Sylvester a [[Crescentii|Crescentian]], and Gregory was a reformer ([[Simony|simoniac]]). Henry marched to [[Verona]] and [[Pavia]], where he held court and dispensed justice. He moved on to [[Sutri]] and held [[Council of Sutri|a second court]] on 20 December 1046 where he deposed all three papal candidates. In Rome he held a synod, declared all Roman priests unfit for office and as Adalbert of Bremen refused the honour, Henry appointed [[Pope Clement II|Suidger of Bamberg]], who was acclaimed by the people and clergy. He adopted the name [[Pope Clement II|Clement II]].<ref name=\"Stroll2011\">{{cite book|author=Mary Stroll|title=Popes and Antipopes: The Politics of Eleventh Century Church Reform|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RhLKFV63fYwC&pg=PA10|date=9 December 2011|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-21701-0|pages=10\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"ThorndikeShotwell1928\">{{cite book|author1=Lynn Thorndike|author2=James Thomson Shotwell|title=The History of Medieval Europe p.285|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xyfGDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1|year=1928|publisher=Dalcassian Publishing Company|pages=285\u2013|id=GGKEY:TY4HYGTG9WL}}</ref>\n\nOn Christmas Day 1046, Clement was consecrated, and Henry and Agnes crowned emperor and empress. The Roman citizen awarded Henry the ''Golden Chain of the Patriciate'' and elvated him to ''[[Patrikios|patricius]]''. Henry visited [[Frascati]], the capital of the [[counts of Tusculum]] and seized all castles of the Crescentii family. Joined by the pope he ventured to southern Italy and reverted most of his fathers policies.<ref name=ordn>{{cite web |url=https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/vuf/article/view/17742 |title=Ordnungskonfigurationen im Konflikt Das Beispiel Kaiser Heinrichs III. |publisher=  Uni Heidelberg  |author=Stefan Weinfurter |date=  |accessdate=February 16, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nAt [[Capua]], Henry was received by Prince [[Guaimar IV of Salerno]] and [[Prince of Capua|Capua]]. However, Henry returned Capua to the twice-deprived Prince [[Pandulf IV of Capua|Pandulf IV]], a highly unpopular choice. Guaimar had been acclaimed as [[Duke of Apulia and Calabria]] by the [[Italo-Normans|Norman]] mercenaries under [[William Iron Arm]] and his brother [[Drogo of Hauteville]].\n\nIn return, Guaimar had recognized the conquests of the Normans and invested William as his vassal with the [[Count|comital]] title. Henry made Drogo, William's successor in Apulia, a direct vassal of the imperial crown. He did likewise to [[Ranulf Drengot]], the count of [[Aversa]], who had been a vassal of Guaimar as Prince of Capua. Thus, Guaimar was deprived of his greatest vassals, his principality split in two, and his greatest enemy reinstated. These decisions  made Henry unpopular among the Lombards and [[Benevento]], although a papal vassal, would not approve of him. The Italian circuit was completed when he arrived at Verona in May 1047.<ref name=bio/>\n\n===Henry's appointments===\nUpon his return to Germany, Henry assigned the offices that had been left vacant. He transferred his last personal duchy to [[Welf, Duke of Carinthia|Welf]] duke of Carinthia, made his Italian [[chancellor]] Hunfried [[Bishop of Ravenna]] appointed several other chairs, installed Guido in [[Piacenza]], his chaplain Theodoric in Verdun, the provost Herman of Speyer in [[Strasbourg]] and his German chancellor Theodoric in Constance. The important Lorrainian bishoprics of [[Metz]] and [[Trier]] received respectively [[Adalbero III of Luxembourg|Adalbero]] and [[Eberhard, Archbishop of Trier|Eberhard]], a chaplain.<ref name=\"Steinhoff1865\"/>\n\nHenry was at Metz in July 1047 when a latent insurrection rose in rebellion. Godfrey was now allied with Baldwin of Flanders, his son (the margrave of Antwerp), Dirk of Holland, and [[Herman, Count of Hainaut]]. Henry gathered an army and went north, where he gave Adalbert of Bremen Godfrey's former lands and oversaw the trial by combat of Thietmar, the brother of [[Bernard II, Duke of Saxony]], accused of plotting to kill the king. Bernard, an enemy of Adalbert, was now clearly on Henry's bad side. Henry made peace with the new king of Hungary, [[Andrew I of Hungary|Andrew I]], and moved into the [[Netherlands]]. At Flushing, he was defeated by Dirk. The Hollanders sacked [[Charlemagne]]'s palace at [[Nijmegen]] and burnt Verdun. Godfrey then performed a public penance and assisted in the reconstruction of Verdun.<ref name=\"Steinhoff1865\"/>\n\nThe rebels besieged [[Li\u00e8ge (city)|Li\u00e8ge]], that was stoutly defended by Bishop [[Wazo]]. Henry gave Upper Lorraine to one [[Adalbert, Duke of Lorraine|Adalbert]] and left. The pope had died in the meantime and Henry chose Poppo of Brixen to succeed him, who adopted the name [[Damasus II]]. Henry gave Bavaria to one [[Cuno, Duke of Bavaria|Cuno]] and, at Ulm in January 1048, Swabia to [[Otto III, Duke of Swabia|Otto of Schweinfurt]], called ''the White''. Henry met Henry of France again, probably at Ivois in October and at Christmas, envoys from Rome came to seek a new pope, Damasus having died. Henry's most enduring papal selection was Bruno of Toul, who took office as [[Leo IX]], under whom the Church would be divided between East and West. Henry's final appointment of this long spate was a successor to Adalbert in Lorraine. For this, he appointed [[Gerard, Duke of Lorraine|Gerard of Chatenoy]], a relative of Adalbert and Henry himself.<ref name=\"Jaeger2013\">{{cite book|author=C.

Dirk of Holland was defeated and killed. Adalbert of Bremen managed a peace with Bernard of Saxony and negotiated a treaty with the missionary monarch [[Sweyn II of Denmark]]. With the assistance of Sweyn and [[Edward the Confessor]] of England, whose enemies Baldwin had harboured, Baldwin of Flanders was harassed by sea and unable to escape the onslaught of the imperial army. At Cologne, the pope excommunicated Godfrey and Baldwin. The former abandoned his allies and was imprisoned by the emperor again. Baldwin also gave in under Henry's pressure. Finally, the war had ended in the Low Countries and Lorraine.<ref name=wein>{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/31120508/Stefan_Weinfurter_Das_Jahrhundert_der_Salier_1024-1125_ |title=  Das Jahrhundert der Salier (1024-1125) | publisher =  Academia  |date=   |author=Stefan Weinfurter  |accessdate= February 16, 2020  }}</ref>\n\n==Final years==\n\nIn 1051, Henry undertook a third Hungarian campaign but suffered a major defeat. His troops fled the battlefield over a range of hills still called \"V\u00e9rtes\" (\"Armoured\") because discarded armour has been found there for centuries. In Lower Lorraine  [[Lambert II, Count of Leuven|Lambert, Count of Louvain]], and Richildis, widow of Herman of Mons and new bride of Baldwin of Antwerp, caused trouble. Godfrey was released and given Lower Lorraine, to safeguard the unstable peace attained two years before.\n\nIn 1052, Henry undertook a fourth campaign against Hungary, and besieged [[Bratislava|Pressburg]] without success, as the Hungarians sank his supply ships on the Danube river. Henry was unable to continue his campaign and in fact never tried again. Henry did send a Swabian army to assist Leo in Italy, but he recalled it quickly. At Christmas 1052, Cuno of Bavaria was summoned to Merseburg and deposed by a small council of princes for his conflict with [[Gebhard III, Bishop of Regensburg]]. Cuno revolted.<ref name=\"Steinhoff1865\"/>\n\n===Final wars in Germany===\nOn 26 June 1053, at Tribur, the young [[Emperor Henry IV|Henry]], born 11 November 1050, was elected king of Germany. Andrew of Hungary almost made peace, but Cuno convinced him otherwise. Henry appointed his young son duke of Bavaria and went to deal with the ongoing insurrection. Henry sent another army to assist Leo in the [[Mezzogiorno]] against the Normans he himself had confirmed in their conquests as his vassal. Leo, without assistance from Guaimar (distanced from Henry since 1047), was defeated at the [[Battle of Civitate]] on 18 June 1053 by [[Humphrey of Hauteville|Humphrey]], Count of Apulia. [[Robert Guiscard]], his younger brother; and Prince [[Richard I of Capua]]. The Swabians were cut to pieces.<ref name=\"Schneidm\u00fcllerWeinfurter2003\"/>\n\nIn 1054, Henry traveled north to deal with the bellicose Casimir of Poland. He transferred [[Silesia]] from Bretislav to Casimir. Bretislaus nevertheless remained loyal to the end. Henry turned westwards and crowned his young son at Aachen on July 17 and then marched into Flanders, as the two Baldwins had rebelled again. John of Arras, who had seized [[Cambrai]] before, had been forced out by Baldwin of Flanders and so turned to the Emperor. In return for inducing [[Liutpert, Bishop of Cambrai]], to give John the castle, John would lead Henry through Flanders. The Flemish campaign was a success, but Liutpert could not be convinced.\n\nBretislav, who had regained Silesia in a short war, died in 1054. The margrave [[Adalbert of Austria]], however, successfully resisted the depredations of Cuno and the raids of the king of Hungary. Henry could thus direct his attention elsewhere than rebellions for once. He returned to Goslar, the city where his son had been born and which he had raised to imperial and ecclesiastic grandeur with his palace and church reforms. He passed Christmas there and appointed [[Pope Victor II|Gebhard of Eichstedt]] as the next holder of the Petrine see, with the name Victor II. He was the last of Henry's four German popes.<ref name=ordn/>\n\n===Preparing Italy and Germany for his death===\n[[File:Reichsapfel Heinrich III.JPG|thumb|Imperial orb from the burial inventory of Henry III]]\n[[File:SargHeinrichDrei.jpg|thumb|Sarcophagus of Henry III in Goslar]]\nIn 1055, Henry turned south, to Italy again, for [[Boniface&nbsp;III of Tuscany]], ever an imperial ally, had died, and his widow, [[Beatrice of Bar]] had married Godfrey of Lorraine (1054). First, however, he gave his old hostage, [[Spytihn\u011bv II of Bohemia|Spitignev]], the son of Bretislaus to the Bohemians as duke. Spitignev did homage and Bohemia remained securely, loyally, and happily within the Imperial fold. By Easter, Henry had arrived in [[Mantua]]. He held several courts, one at [[Roncaglia (Piacenza)|Roncaglia]], where, a century later (1158), [[Frederick Barbarossa]] held a [[Diet of Roncaglia|far more important diet]], sent out his ''[[missi dominici]]'' to establish order. Godfrey, ostensibly the reason for the visit, was not well received by the people and returned to Flanders. Henry met the pope at [[Florence]] and arrested Beatrice for marrying a traitor, and her daughter [[Matilda of Tuscany|Matilda]], later to be such an enemy of Henry's son. The young [[Frederick of Tuscany]], son of Beatrice, refused to come to Florence and died within days.<ref name=\"Schneidm\u00fcllerWeinfurter2003\"/>\n\nHenry returned and at Christmas 1055 he arranged the subsequent marriage of his successor. In [[Zurich]], the heir to the throne, [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]], was engaged to [[Bertha of Savoy|Bertha]] of Turin of the [[House of Savoy]].<ref name=\"Houts2019\">{{cite book|author=Elisabeth van Houts|title=Married Life in the Middle Ages, 900-1300|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZuCGDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT296|date=31 January 2019|publisher=OUP inrichOxford|isbn=978-0-19-251974-0|pages=47\u2013}}</ref>\n\nHenry entered a Germany in turmoil. A staunch ally against Cuno in Bavaria, Gebhard of Regensburg, was implicated in a plot against the king along with Cuno and Welf of Carinthia. Sources diverge here: some claim only that the retainers of the princes plotted the undoing of the king. Whatever the case, it all came to naught, and Cuno died of [[Bubonic plague|plague]], and Welf soon following him to the grave. Baldwin of Flanders and Godfrey were at it again, besieging Antwerp, and they were defeated again. Henry's reign was clearly changing in character: old foes were dead or dying and old friends as well.<ref name=ordn/>\n\nHerman of Cologne died. Henry appointed his confessor, [[Anno II, archbishop of Cologne|Anno]], as Herman's successor. Henry of France, so long eyeing Lorraine greedily, met for a third time with the emperor at Ivois in May 1056. The French king, not renowned for his tactical or strategic prowess, but admirable for his personal valour on the field, had a heated debate with the German king and challenged him to single combat. Henry fled at night from this meeting. Once in Germany again, Godfrey made his final peace, and Henry went to the northeast to deal with a Slav uprising after the death of William of Meissen. He fell ill on the way and took to bed. He freed Beatrice and Matilda and had those with him [[designation (monarchy)|swear allegiance]] to the young Henry, whom he commended the pope, present.\n\nOn 5 October, not yet forty, Henry died at [[Bodfeld]], the imperial hunting lodge in the [[Harz Mountains]].{{sfn|Whitney|1968|p=31}} His heart was transferred to Goslar and his body to [[Speyer]], to rest next to his father's in the family vault of the [[Speyer Cathedral|cathedral of Speyer]]. Henry had been one of the most powerful of the Holy Roman Emperors. His authority as king in Burgundy, Germany, and Italy was only rarely questioned, his power over the church was at the root of what the reformers he sponsored later fought against in his son, and his achievement in binding to the empire her tributaries was clear. Nevertheless, his reign is often pronounced a failure in that he apparently left problems far beyond the capacities of his successors to handle. The [[Investiture Controversy]] was largely the result of his church politics, though his popemaking gave the Roman diocese to the reform party.<ref name=\"Giesebrecht1841\">{{cite book|author=Wilhelm von Giesebrecht|title=Annales Altahenses: eine Quellenschrift zur Geschichte des eilften Jahrhunderts aus Fragmenten und Excerpten hergestellt|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_fv1BAAAAYAAJ|year=1841|publisher=Duncker und Humblot|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_fv1BAAAAYAAJ/page/n219 125]\u2013}}</ref> He united all the great duchies save Saxony to himself at one point or another but gave them all away.

In past times they were also famous for their ironworking skills, as the country and its neighbors possess rich deposits of iron.  Kissi smiths produced the famous \"[[Kissi penny]],\" iron money that was used widely in West and even Central Africa.\n\n==Economy==\nThe Kissi are primarily farmers. Rice, their staple crop, is grown on most hillsides and in low, [[swamp]]y areas. Other crops include peanuts, cotton, corn, bananas, potatoes, and melons. Beans, tomatoes, onions, and peppers are grown in small vegetable gardens, and coffee raised as a cash crop. Most of the farmers also raise some livestock.\n\nAgricultural work, such as sowing, weeding, and harvesting, is shared equally by the men and women. Additional responsibilities for the men include [[hunting]], fishing, and clearing land. The women's duties involve caring for the small vegetable gardens, tending to the chickens, trading in the local markets, and doing some fishing. Boys tend to livestock, which is usually cattle and goats. Cows are considered valuable animals, not for their milk, but as religious sacrifices.\n\n==Resistance to French conquest by Kissi Kaba Keita==\nIn Guinea, the Kissi warrior [[Kissi Kaba Keita]] managed to unite many Kissi chiefdoms under his reign and resist French conquest for many years. Before French attacks, he had rallied the [[Kuranko people|Kouranko's]] of Morige and the [[Lele people (Guinea)|Lele's]] of [[Yombiro]]. When the French arrived in 1892, he had to let the relatively autonomous chiefs of the respective areas defend themselves. Due to the French's technological superiority, Kissi Kaba resorted mainly to guerilla tactics, thus delaying their conquest of his kingdom. Still, by 1893 he realized that his resistance would fail and subjected himself to the French, who then recognized him as chief of the northern Kissi territory. However, his relationship with the French gradually worsened, which led to them appointing his rivals in a number of his chiefdoms, and eventually to his execution in [[Siguiri]].\n\n==Social systems==\nFor many generations, Kissi are well known as hard-working people. They are very age-oriented, dominated and led by the [[Tribal chief|chief]] and the elderly people. The Kissi live in small, self-governing [[villages]] that are tucked inside groves of mango or kola trees. Each village is compact, containing no more than about 150 people. Houses are usually raised slightly above the ground and are round with mud walls, cone-shaped thatch roofs, and verandahs. In the center of the village is a public square with a dwelling place for the village headman. He offers sacrifices at the village shrine and acts as judge over the community.\n\nTo the Kissi, a child is not considered \"complete\" and is thought of as dirty and impure. Therefore, when a boy or girl reaches [[puberty]], a [[Ritual purification| purification]] ritual is held. This ceremony, called a biriye, \"cleanses\" the child and ushers them into adulthood. Afterwards, the young adult is expected to take on adult responsibilities.\n\nMusic plays a unique role in the Kissi culture. Sometimes, it is used for certain types of communication. The music does not necessarily have a melody, but rather a rhythmic sound with much drumming and whistling.\n\n==Religion and spiritual beliefs==\nAlthough many Kissi have converted to Christianity, most of them continue to practice their traditional ethnic religion. [[Ancestor worship]] or praying to deceased relatives is a common practice among the Kissi. The Kissi believe that ancestral spirits act as mediators between them and the creator, god. Small stone statues are used to represent the spirits. They are worshipped and offered sacrifices by the village headmen.  Many carved [[soapstone]] figures and heads were produced by the Kissi people in the past prior to colonial contact with the Europeans. It is not clear why they were made; some scholars argue that they form part of ancestor worship while others say they may represent gods to increase agricultural yields. A large number can be seen in the [[British Museum]]'s collection.<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?searchText=Sierra+Leone+soapstone British Museum Collection]</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Kissi constantly live in fear of the [[supernatural]].

In past times they were also famous for their ironworking skills, as the country and its neighbors possess rich deposits of iron.  Kissi smiths produced the famous \"[[Kissi penny]],\" iron money that was used widely in West and even Central Africa.\n\n==Economy==\nThe Kissi are primarily farmers. Rice, their staple crop, is grown on most hillsides and in low, [[swamp]]y areas. Other crops include peanuts, cotton, corn, bananas, potatoes, and melons. Beans, tomatoes, onions, and peppers are grown in small vegetable gardens, and coffee raised as a cash crop. Most of the farmers also raise some livestock.\n\nAgricultural work, such as sowing, weeding, and harvesting, is shared equally by the men and women. Additional responsibilities for the men include [[hunting]], fishing, and clearing land. The women's duties involve caring for the small vegetable gardens, tending to the chickens, trading in the local markets, and doing some fishing. Boys tend to livestock, which is usually cattle and goats. Cows are considered valuable animals, not for their milk, but as religious sacrifices.\n\n==Resistance to French conquest by Kissi Kaba Keita==\nIn Guinea, the Kissi warrior [[Kissi Kaba Keita]] managed to unite many Kissi chiefdoms under his reign and resist French conquest for many years. Before French attacks, he had rallied the [[Kuranko people|Kuranko's]] of Morige and the [[Lele language (Guinea)|Lele's]] of [[Yombiro]]. When the French arrived in 1892, he had to let the relatively autonomous chiefs of the respective areas defend themselves. Due to the French's technological superiority, Kissi Kaba resorted mainly to guerilla tactics, thus delaying their conquest of his kingdom. Still, by 1893 he realized that his resistance would fail and subjected himself to the French, who then recognized him as chief of the northern Kissi territory. However, his relationship with the French gradually worsened, which led to them appointing his rivals in a number of his chiefdoms, and eventually to his execution in [[Siguiri]].\n\n==Social systems==\nFor many generations, Kissi are well known as hard-working people. They are very age-oriented, dominated and led by the [[Tribal chief|chief]] and the elderly people. The Kissi live in small, self-governing [[villages]] that are tucked inside groves of mango or kola trees. Each village is compact, containing no more than about 150 people. Houses are usually raised slightly above the ground and are round with mud walls, cone-shaped thatch roofs, and verandahs. In the center of the village is a public square with a dwelling place for the village headman. He offers sacrifices at the village shrine and acts as judge over the community.\n\nTo the Kissi, a child is not considered \"complete\" and is thought of as dirty and impure. Therefore, when a boy or girl reaches [[puberty]], a [[Ritual purification| purification]] ritual is held. This ceremony, called a biriye, \"cleanses\" the child and ushers them into adulthood. Afterwards, the young adult is expected to take on adult responsibilities.\n\nMusic plays a unique role in the Kissi culture. Sometimes, it is used for certain types of communication. The music does not necessarily have a melody, but rather a rhythmic sound with much drumming and whistling.\n\n==Religion and spiritual beliefs==\nAlthough many Kissi have converted to Christianity, most of them continue to practice their traditional ethnic religion. [[Ancestor worship]] or praying to deceased relatives is a common practice among the Kissi. The Kissi believe that ancestral spirits act as mediators between them and the creator, god. Small stone statues are used to represent the spirits. They are worshipped and offered sacrifices by the village headmen.  Many carved [[soapstone]] figures and heads were produced by the Kissi people in the past prior to colonial contact with the Europeans. It is not clear why they were made; some scholars argue that they form part of ancestor worship while others say they may represent gods to increase agricultural yields. A large number can be seen in the [[British Museum]]'s collection.<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?searchText=Sierra+Leone+soapstone British Museum Collection]</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Kissi constantly live in fear of the [[supernatural]]. They wear charms in order to protect themselves from the evil spirits. [[Witchcraft]] is also practiced by sorcerers and witches. Some of the elders and religious leaders communicate with spirits through trances and hypnosis. The biriye and other rituals are held in the forest since this is thought to be a sacred setting.\n\nThe Kissi reside in an area affected by the [[Ebola virus]], and the customs of the people are a substantial contributing factor to the spread of [[Ebola virus disease]].<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2014/07/04/health/ebola-outbreak-west-africa/ Ebola outbreak: 11 African nations agree to plan to tackle deadly epidemic]</ref>\n\n==Kissi people== \n*[[Kissi Kaba Keita]], a warrior who resisted French conquest from 1892 on.\n*[[Kai Londo]], great Kissi warrior from Sierra Leone who conquered a large territory and ruled with wisdom in Southern Sierra Leone.\n*[[Pascal Feindouno]], Guinean footballer\n*[[Tamba Hali]], defensive end for the [[Kansas City Chiefs]]\n*[[Simon Feindouno]], Guinean footballer\n*[[Joseph Boakai]], former vice president of Liberia\n*[[Fran\u00e7ois Kamano]], Guinean footballer\n*[[Tom Nyuma]], a retired colonel in the Sierra Leonean Armed Forces, and the current council chairman of [[Kailahun]] District\n*[[Jusu Sawie]], member of Sierra Leone's parliament representing Kailahun District\n*[[Kai Abdul Foday]], member of Sierra Leone's parliament representing [[Kono District]]\n*[[Augustine Kortu]], Sierra Leonean politician   \n*[[Tamba Borbor-Sawyer]], [[Sierra Leonean]] politician and a retired officer in the [[Sierra Leone Police]].\n*[[King James Cleveland]], [[:wiki: Euro-african|Euro-african]] son of Ndamba and [[William Clevland (king)|William Clevland]].\n*Daniel N.

The album was recorded by [[Bill Szymczyk]] at the [[Criteria Studios|Criteria]] and [[Record Plant]] studios between March and October 1976, and then released on [[Asylum Records|Asylum]] in December. It was their first album with guitarist [[Joe Walsh]], who had replaced founding member [[Bernie Leadon]], and is the last album to feature bassist [[Randy Meisner]]. The front cover is a photograph of [[the Beverly Hills Hotel]] by David Alexander. \n\n''Hotel California'' topped the US [[Billboard Top LPs & Tape|''Billboard'' Top LPs & Tapes]] chart. At the [[20th Annual Grammy Awards|20th Grammy Awards]], the Eagles won a [[Grammy Award]] for \"[[Hotel California]]\", which won [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]], and for \"[[New Kid in Town]]\". The album was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] but lost to [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s ''[[Rumours (album)|Rumours]]''. Three singles were released from the album, with two topping the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]: \"[[New Kid in Town]]\" and \"[[Hotel California]]\", whilst \"[[Life in the Fast Lane]]\" reached No. 11. \n\nA 40th anniversary special edition of ''Hotel California'' was released in November 2017. ''Hotel California'' is one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums of all time]]. It has been certified [[RIAA certification|26\u00d7 Platinum]] in the US, and has sold over 32 million copies sold worldwide, making it the band's best-selling album after ''[[Their Greatest Hits (1971\u20131975)]]''. It has been ranked as one of the greatest albums of all time. In 2003 and 2012, it was ranked number 37 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'s}} list of \"[[The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]\".\n\n==Theme==\nThe first song written for the album was \"[[Hotel California]]\", which became the theme for the album.<ref name=\"complete\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/eagles-complete-discography-don-henley-looks-back-20160610/hotel-california-1975-20160609 |title=Eagles' Complete Discography: Don Henley Looks Back |first=David |last=Browne|date=June 10, 2016 |work=Rolling Stone }}</ref> Henley said of the themes of the songs in the album: \n{{cquote|They're the same themes that run through all of our work: loss of innocence, the cost of naivet\u00e9, the perils of fame, of excess; exploration of the dark underbelly of the American dream, idealism realized and idealism thwarted, illusion versus reality, the difficulties of balancing loving relationships and work, trying to square the conflicting relationship between business and art; the corruption in politics, the fading away of the Sixties dream of \"peace, love and understanding.\"<ref name=\"complete\"/>}}\nOn the title \"Hotel California\", Henley said that \"the word, \"California,\" carries with it all kinds of connotations, powerful imagery, mystique, etc., that fires the imaginations of people in all corners of the globe. There's a built-in mythology that comes with that word, an American cultural mythology that has been created by both the film and the music industry.\"<ref name=\"complete\"/>  In an interview with the Dutch magazine ''[[ZigZag (magazine)|ZigZag]]'' shortly before the album's release, [[Don Henley]] said: \n{{cquote|This is a concept album, there's no way to hide it, but it's not set in the old West, the cowboy thing, you know.

For ''Hotel California'', the band made a conscious decision to move away from country rock, and wrote some songs that are more rock & roll, such as \"Victim of Love\" and \"[[Life in the Fast Lane]]\". Leadon was replaced by [[Joe Walsh]] who provided the opening guitar riff of \"Life in the Fast Lane\" that was then developed into the song. The title for \"Life in the Fast Lane\" was inspired by a conversation between Frey and his drug dealer during a high speed car ride.<ref name=\"rollingstone\"/>\n\nThe melody of the title track, \"Hotel California\", was written by [[Don Felder]]. [[Don Henley]] wrote most of the lyrics, with contributions from [[Glenn Frey]]. Henley noted that hotel had become a \"literal and symbolic focal point of their lives at that time\", and it became the theme of the song. Frey wanted the song to be \"more cinematic\", and to write it \"just like it was a movie\".  Henley sought inspiration for the lyrics by driving out into the desert, as well as from films and theatre.<ref name=\"crowe\">{{cite web |url=http://www.theuncool.com/journalism/the-very-best-of-the-eagles/ |title= Conversations With Don Henley and Glenn Frey|author= Cameron Crowe |date=August 2003 |work= The Uncool}}</ref> Parts of the lyrics of \"Hotel California\" as well as the song \"Wasted Time\" were based on Henley's break up with his then girlfriend [[Loree Rodkin]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=pcmmQgAACAAJ |title=To The Limit: The Untold Story Of The Eagles |first=Marc |last=Eliot |pages=123\u2013127, 148 |publisher=Da Capo Press |year=2004 |accessdate=January 21, 2016 |isbn=9780306813986 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/readers-poll-the-10-best-eagles-songs-20150729/wasted-time-20150729 |title= Readers' Poll: The 10 Best Eagles Songs }}</ref>\n\nFrey, in the \"Hotel California\" episode of ''[[In the Studio with Redbeard]]'', spoke about the writing of \"[[The Last Resort (Eagles song)|The Last Resort]]\".

It was considered for [[quadraphonic]] release in early 1977, but this idea was dropped following the demise of the quadraphonic format. On the album's 25th anniversary in 2001, it was released in a Multichannel 5.1 [[DVD-Audio]] disc. On August 17, 2011, the album was released on a hybrid [[Super Audio CD|SACD]] in Japan in [[The Warner Premium Sound series]], containing both a stereo and a [[5.1]] mix.<ref>[http://wmg.jp/sacdcd/?icid=top110810 Warner Premium Sound series website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813061646/http://www.wmg.jp/sacdcd/?icid=top110810 |date=August 13, 2011 }} (in Japanese).

The text reads: Side one: \"Is It 6 O'Clock Yet?\"; Side two: \"V.O.L. Is Five-Piece Live\", indicating that the song \"Victim of Love\" was recorded in a live session in studio, with no overdubbing.

The album was recorded by [[Bill Szymczyk]] at the [[Criteria Studios|Criteria]] and [[Record Plant]] studios between March and October 1976, and then released on [[Asylum Records|Asylum]] in December. It was their first album with guitarist [[Joe Walsh]], who had replaced founding member [[Bernie Leadon]], and is the last album to feature bassist [[Randy Meisner]]. The front cover is a photograph of [[the Beverly Hills Hotel]] by David Alexander. \n\n''Hotel California'' topped the US [[Billboard Top LPs & Tape|''Billboard'' Top LPs & Tapes]] chart. At the [[20th Annual Grammy Awards|20th Grammy Awards]], the Eagles won a [[Grammy Award]] for \"[[Hotel California]]\", which won [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]], and for \"[[New Kid in Town]]\". The album was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] but lost to [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s ''[[Rumours (album)|Rumours]]''. Three singles were released from the album, with two topping the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]: \"[[New Kid in Town]]\" and \"[[Hotel California]]\", whilst \"[[Life in the Fast Lane]]\" reached No. 11. \n\nA 40th anniversary special edition of ''Hotel California'' was released in November 2017. ''Hotel California'' is one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums of all time]]. It has been certified [[RIAA certification|26\u00d7 Platinum]] in the US, and has sold over 32 million copies sold worldwide, making it the band's best-selling album after ''[[Their Greatest Hits (1971\u20131975)]]''. It has been ranked as one of the greatest albums of all time. In 2003 and 2012, it was ranked number 37 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'s}} list of \"[[The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]\".\n\n==Theme==\nThe first song written for the album was \"[[Hotel California]]\", which became the theme for the album.<ref name=\"complete\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/eagles-complete-discography-don-henley-looks-back-20160610/hotel-california-1975-20160609 |title=Eagles' Complete Discography: Don Henley Looks Back |first=David |last=Browne|date=June 10, 2016 |work=Rolling Stone }}</ref> Henley said of the themes of the songs in the album: \n{{cquote|They're the same themes that run through all of our work: loss of innocence, the cost of naivet\u00e9, the perils of fame, of excess; exploration of the dark underbelly of the American dream, idealism realized and idealism thwarted, illusion versus reality, the difficulties of balancing loving relationships and work, trying to square the conflicting relationship between business and art; the corruption in politics, the fading away of the Sixties dream of \"peace, love and understanding.\"<ref name=\"complete\"/>}}\nOn the title \"Hotel California\", Henley said that \"the word, \"California,\" carries with it all kinds of connotations, powerful imagery, mystique, etc., that fires the imaginations of people in all corners of the globe. There's a built-in mythology that comes with that word, an American cultural mythology that has been created by both the film and the music industry.\"<ref name=\"complete\"/>  In an interview with the Dutch magazine ''[[ZigZag (magazine)|ZigZag]]'' shortly before the album's release, [[Don Henley]] said: \n{{cquote|This is a concept album, there's no way to hide it, but it's not set in the old West, the cowboy thing, you know. It's more urban this time (\u2026) It's our bicentennial year, you know, the country is 200 years old, so we figured since we are the Eagles and the Eagle is our national symbol, that we were obliged to make some kind of a little [[United States Bicentennial|bicentennial]] statement using [[California]] as a microcosm of the whole United States, or the whole world, if you will, and to try to wake people up and say 'We've been okay so far, for 200 years, but we're gonna have to change if we're gonna continue to be around.'\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Vaughan |first=Andrew |title=The Eagles FAQ: All That's Left to Know About Classic Rock's Superstars |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qky9CQAAQBAJ&pg=PT165 |page=165 |publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation |year=2015}}</ref>}}\n\n==Composition==\n[[Bernie Leadon]], who was the principal country influence in the band, left the band after the release of the previous album ''[[One of These Nights]]''.  For ''Hotel California'', the band made a conscious decision to move away from country rock, and wrote some songs that are more rock & roll, such as \"Victim of Love\" and \"[[Life in the Fast Lane]]\". Leadon was replaced by [[Joe Walsh]] who provided the opening guitar riff of \"Life in the Fast Lane\" that was then developed into the song. The title for \"Life in the Fast Lane\" was inspired by a conversation between Frey and his drug dealer during a high speed car ride.<ref name=\"rollingstone\"/>\n\nThe melody of the title track, \"Hotel California\", was written by [[Don Felder]]. [[Don Henley]] wrote most of the lyrics, with contributions from [[Glenn Frey]]. Henley noted that hotel had become a \"literal and symbolic focal point of their lives at that time\", and it became the theme of the song. Frey wanted the song to be \"more cinematic\", and to write it \"just like it was a movie\".  Henley sought inspiration for the lyrics by driving out into the desert, as well as from films and theatre.<ref name=\"crowe\">{{cite web |url=http://www.theuncool.com/journalism/the-very-best-of-the-eagles/ |title= Conversations With Don Henley and Glenn Frey|author= Cameron Crowe |date=August 2003 |work= The Uncool}}</ref> Parts of the lyrics of \"Hotel California\" as well as the song \"Wasted Time\" were based on Henley's break up with his then girlfriend [[Loree Rodkin]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=pcmmQgAACAAJ |title=To The Limit: The Untold Story Of The Eagles |first=Marc |last=Eliot |pages=123\u2013127, 148 |publisher=Da Capo Press |year=2004 |accessdate=January 21, 2016 |isbn=9780306813986 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/readers-poll-the-10-best-eagles-songs-20150729/wasted-time-20150729 |title= Readers' Poll: The 10 Best Eagles Songs }}</ref>\n\nFrey, in the \"Hotel California\" episode of ''[[In the Studio with Redbeard]]'', spoke about the writing of \"[[The Last Resort (Eagles song)|The Last Resort]]\".  Frey said: \"It was the first time that Don took it upon himself to write an epic story and we were already starting to worry about the environment\u2026 we're constantly screwing up paradise and that was the point of the song and that at some point there is going to be no more new frontiers.

The best parts were then spliced together, in all 33 edits on the two\u2011inch master, to create the final version.<ref name=\"sound on sound\"/> In contrast, \"Victim of Love\" was recorded in a live session in studio apart from the lead vocal and the harmony on the choruses which were added later. Don Felder initially sang the lead vocals in the many early takes for the song, but the band felt that his efforts were not up to the required standard, and Henley then took over as the lead.<ref name=\"rollingstone\"/>\n\nAccording to Henley in a 1982 interview, the Eagles \"probably peaked on ''Hotel California''.\" Henley said: \"After that, we started growing apart as collaborators and as friends.\"<ref>{{cite web |url= https://rockhall.com/inductees/the-eagles/bio/ |title=The Eagles Biography |work=Rock & Roll Hall of Fame }}</ref>\n\n==Artwork==\n[[File:The Eagles in Concert 2010 - Hotel California.jpg|thumb|Eagles performing \"Hotel California\" in 2010 with the image from the album cover in the background]]\nThe front [[cover art]]work is a photograph of [[The Beverly Hills Hotel]] shot just before sunset by David Alexander with design and art direction by [[Kosh (art director)|Kosh]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Ochs |first=Micheael |editor= |others= |title=1000 Record Covers |origyear= |month= |url= |edition= |series= |publisher=Taschen |isbn=3-8228-4085-8 |oclc= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= }}</ref>  According to Kosh, Henley wanted him to find a place that can portray the Hotel California of the album title, and \"portray it with a slightly sinister edge\".

As it proved difficult to bend real neon tubings into the desired shape of the script, the neon effect of the logo was achieved with [[airbrush]] by Bob Hickson. Additional portraits of the band used in the album package and promotional materials were shot by [[Norman Seeff]].<ref name=\"album cover\"/>\n\n==Release==\nThe album was released by [[Asylum Records]] on  December 8, 1976 in [[vinyl record|vinyl]], [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] and [[8-track tape|8-track cartridge]] formats. It was considered for [[quadraphonic]] release in early 1977, but this idea was dropped following the demise of the quadraphonic format. On the album's 25th anniversary in 2001, it was released in a Multichannel 5.1 [[DVD-Audio]] disc. On August 17, 2011, the album was released on a hybrid [[Super Audio CD|SACD]] in Japan in [[The Warner Premium Sound series]], containing both a stereo and a [[5.1]] mix.<ref>[http://wmg.jp/sacdcd/?icid=top110810 Warner Premium Sound series website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813061646/http://www.wmg.jp/sacdcd/?icid=top110810 |date=August 13, 2011 }} (in Japanese).

These also had text engraved in the run-out groove of each side, continuing an in-joke trend the band had started with their third album [[On the Border]]. The text reads: Side one: \"Is It 6 O'Clock Yet?\"; Side two: \"V.O.L. Is Five-Piece Live\", indicating that the song \"Victim of Love\" was recorded in a live session in studio, with no overdubbing. [[Joe Walsh]] and Glenn Frey confirm this on the inner booklet of ''[[The Very Best Of (Eagles album)|The Very Best Of]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.glennfreyonline.com/eagles/verybest/linernotes.htm |title=Liner Notes Booklet: Conversations with Don Henley and Glenn Frey by Cameron Crowe August 2003 |work=Glenn Frey Online }}</ref> This only referred to the instrumental track, however; the lead vocal and harmony for the chorus were added later. This was in response to those who criticized the Eagles' practice of copious overdubbing of instruments and that they were too clinical and soulless in the studio. They wanted to demonstrate that they could play together without overdubs if they wanted to.<ref name=\"rollingstone\"/>\n\nA 40th anniversary deluxe edition was released on 24 November 2017.

It was released in 1979, on [[Asylum Records|Asylum]] in the United States and in the United Kingdom. This was the first Eagles album to feature [[Timothy B. Schmit]], who had replaced founding member [[Randy Meisner]] and the last full studio album to feature [[Don Felder]] before his termination from the band in 2001.\n\nThis was the band's final studio album for [[Asylum Records]]. It also turned out to be their last studio album as the Eagles disbanded in 1980, until 2007's ''[[Long Road Out of Eden]]'' after the band had reformed in 1994.\n\nThree singles were released from the album, \"[[Heartache Tonight]]\", \"[[The Long Run (song)|The Long Run]]\", and \"[[I Can't Tell You Why]]\".  \"Heartache Tonight\" reached No. 1 on the singles chart and won a [[Grammy Award]]. The album was certified 7\u00d7 Platinum by the RIAA and has sold more than eight million copies in the US.\n\n==Background==\nThe album was originally intended to be a double album. The band could not come up with enough songs and the idea was therefore scrapped. The recording was protracted; they started recording in 1977, and the album took 18 months to record in five different studios, with the album finally released in September 1979.<ref name=\"ultimate\">{{cite web |url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/eagles-long-run/ |title=36 Years Ago: The Eagles Grind to a Halt with \u2018The Long Run\u2019 |first= Jeff|last= Giles |date=September 24, 2015|work=Ultimate Classic Rock }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/eagles-live-1980/ |title=35 Years Ago: The Eagles Limp Away With the Patched-Together \u2018Live\u2019 |first= Nick |last=DeRiso |date=November 7, 2015|work=Ultimate Classic Rock}}</ref> According to [[Don Henley]], the members of the band were \"completely burned out\" and \"physically, emotionally, spiritually and creatively exhausted\" from a long tour when they started recording the album, and they had few songs.<ref name=\"complete\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/eagles-complete-discography-don-henley-looks-back-20160610/the-long-run-1979-20160609 |title=Eagles' Complete Discography: Don Henley Looks Back |first=David |last=Browne|date=June 10, 2016 |work=Rolling Stone }}</ref> However, they managed to put together ten songs for the album, with contribution from their friends [[J.D. Souther]] and [[Bob Seger]] who co-wrote with Frey and Henley on \"[[Heartache Tonight]]\".<ref name=\"ultimate\"/> (Souther also got songwriting credit on \"Teenage Jail\" and \"The Sad Cafe\".)\n\nAccording to Henley, the title track was in part a response to press articles that said they were \"pass\u00e9\" as disco was then dominant and punk emerging, which inspired lines such as \"Who is gonna make it/ We'll find out in the long run\". He said that the inspiration for the lyrics was also \"irony\", as they wrote about longevity and posterity while the group \"was breaking apart, imploding under the pressure of trying to deliver a worthy follow-up to ''[[Hotel California (Eagles album)|Hotel California]]''\".<ref name=\"complete\"/>\n\nRandy Meisner decided to leave the Eagles after an argument in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]] during the Hotel California Tour in June 1977.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/flashback-the-eagles-play-take-it-to-the-limit-in-1977-20150716 |title=Flashback: The Eagles Play 'Take It to the Limit' in 1977|author= Andy Greene |date=July 16, 2015 |work= Rolling Stone }}</ref> He was replaced by [[Timothy B.

Henley wrote the lyrics.

Run''''' is the sixth studio album by American [[rock music|rock]] group the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]. It was released in 1979, on [[Asylum Records|Asylum]] in the United States and in the United Kingdom. This was the first Eagles album to feature [[Timothy B. Schmit]], who had replaced founding member [[Randy Meisner]] and the last full studio album to feature [[Don Felder]] before his termination from the band in 2001.\n\nThis was the band's final studio album for [[Asylum Records]]. It also turned out to be their last studio album as the Eagles disbanded in 1980, until 2007's ''[[Long Road Out of Eden]]'' after the band had reformed in 1994.\n\nThree singles were released from the album, \"[[Heartache Tonight]]\", \"[[The Long Run (song)|The Long Run]]\", and \"[[I Can't Tell You Why]]\".  \"Heartache Tonight\" reached No. 1 on the singles chart and won a [[Grammy Award]]. The album was certified 7\u00d7 Platinum by the RIAA and has sold more than eight million copies in the US.\n\n==Background==\nThe album was originally intended to be a double album. The band could not come up with enough songs and the idea was therefore scrapped. The recording was protracted; they started recording in 1977, and the album took 18 months to record in five different studios, with the album finally released in September 1979.<ref name=\"ultimate\">{{cite web |url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/eagles-long-run/ |title=36 Years Ago: The Eagles Grind to a Halt with \u2018The Long Run\u2019 |first= Jeff|last= Giles |date=September 24, 2015|work=Ultimate Classic Rock }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/eagles-live-1980/ |title=35 Years Ago: The Eagles Limp Away With the Patched-Together \u2018Live\u2019 |first= Nick |last=DeRiso |date=November 7, 2015|work=Ultimate Classic Rock}}</ref> According to [[Don Henley]], the members of the band were \"completely burned out\" and \"physically, emotionally, spiritually and creatively exhausted\" from a long tour when they started recording the album, and they had few songs.<ref name=\"complete\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/eagles-complete-discography-don-henley-looks-back-20160610/the-long-run-1979-20160609 |title=Eagles' Complete Discography: Don Henley Looks Back |first=David |last=Browne|date=June 10, 2016 |work=Rolling Stone }}</ref> However, they managed to put together ten songs for the album, with contribution from their friends [[J.D. Souther]] and [[Bob Seger]] who co-wrote with Frey and Henley on \"[[Heartache Tonight]]\".<ref name=\"ultimate\"/> (Souther also got songwriting credit on \"Teenage Jail\" and \"The Sad Cafe\".)\n\nAccording to Henley, the title track was in part a response to press articles that said they were \"pass\u00e9\" as disco was then dominant and punk emerging, which inspired lines such as \"Who is gonna make it/ We'll find out in the long run\". He said that the inspiration for the lyrics was also \"irony\", as they wrote about longevity and posterity while the group \"was breaking apart, imploding under the pressure of trying to deliver a worthy follow-up to ''[[Hotel California (Eagles album)|Hotel California]]''\".<ref name=\"complete\"/>\n\nRandy Meisner decided to leave the Eagles after an argument in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]] during the Hotel California Tour in June 1977.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/flashback-the-eagles-play-take-it-to-the-limit-in-1977-20150716 |title=Flashback: The Eagles Play 'Take It to the Limit' in 1977|author= Andy Greene |date=July 16, 2015 |work= Rolling Stone }}</ref> He was replaced by [[Timothy B.
