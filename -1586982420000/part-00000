{"title_page": "Postcolonial theology", "text_new": "'''Postcolonial theology''' is the application of [[Postcolonialism|postcolonial criticism]] to [[Christian theology]]. As is in postcolonial discourse, the term ''postcolonial'' is used without a hyphen, denoting an intellectual reaction against the colonial, instead of being merely sequential to it.{{sfn|Sugirtharajah|2006|p=8}}\n\n== Background ==\nPostcolonial theologians argue that, in the past, the dominant Western form of Christianity is actually determined, shaped, and defined by [[European colonialism]], implying and reinforcing notions such as [[Eurocentrism]], colonial exploitation, and the superiority of European values and culture.{{sfnm|1a1=Amaladoss|1y=2014|1p=107|2a1=Rakotonirina|2y=1999|2p=157|3a1=Steele Ireland|3y=2008|3pp=683\u2013684|4a1=Sugirtharajah|4y=2006|4p=16}} Therefore, critical examination is needed, and alternative interpretations to colonially-tainted narratives need to be constructed.{{sfn|Althaus-Reid|Thompson|1999|pp=i\u2013ii}} This is done by \"revisiting the question of how indigenous cultures can contribute to theology and biblical studies\".{{sfn|Steele Ireland|2008|p=684}}\n\nAlthough [[decolonization]] took place shortly after the [[Second World War]], postcolonial theories did not emerge until the late 1970s. The field of postcolonial theology, correspondingly, did not arise until the 1990s.{{sfn|Kwan|2014|p=9}}\n\nNotable biblical scholars include [[R.&nbsp;S. Sugirtharajah]] and [[Fernando Segovia]] and theologians include [[Musa W. Dube]], [[Wai-Ching Angela Wong]], [[Kwok Pui-lan]], and [[Mayra Rivera]].{{sfnm|1a1=Althaus-Reid|1a2=Thompson|1y=1999|1p=iii|2a1=Kwan|2y=2014|2pp=10\u201313, 18\u201322|3a1=Steele Ireland|3y=2008|3p=683}}\n\n== Biblical criticism ==\nGiven its similarities with literary analysis, it is not surprising that [[biblical studies]] was the first field within Christian studies to apply postcolonial criticism.{{sfn|Kwan|2014|p=9}} Adopting postcolonial critical methods, biblical studies is inspired to take into account issues of \"expansion, domination, and imperialism\" in examining existing biblical interpretation, and in constructing new narratives.{{sfn|Sugirtharajah|2006|p=17}} Indigenous non-Western approaches to theologizing the [[Bible]], previously neglected under the colonial context \"in favor of European methods\", are now revisited, in hope to \"make the Bible comprehensible to the colonized cultures on their own terms\".{{sfn|Steele Ireland|2008|p=684}} Therefore, traditional fields of [[translation]], [[exegesis]], and [[hermeneutics]] in biblical studies have to be reconsidered in light of postcolonial criticism, and non-Western perspectives have to be taken into account, even as focal points.\n\nAmong various scholars, R.&nbsp;S. Sugirtharajah, one of the principal advocates of postcolonial biblical studies, outlined in his book ''The Bible and the Third World'' three hermeneutic approaches which emerged after [[colonialism]]: the native or vernacular approach, the liberation approach, and the postcolonial approach.{{sfn|Sugirtharajah|2001|pp=7\u20139, 175\u2013275}}\n\nThere are certain benefits of applying postcolonial criticism to biblical studies.

However, it is also plausible that the energy-expensive guts decreased in size in ''H. erectus'', because the large ape gut is used to synthesize fat fly fermenting plant matter which was replaced by dietary animal fat, allowing more energy to be diverted to brain growth. This would have increased brain size indirectly while maintaining the same caloric requirements of ancestor species. ''H. erectus'' may have also been the first to use a [[Hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]] food collecting strategy as a response to the increasing dependence on meat. With an emphasis on teamwork, division of labor, and food sharing, hunting and gathering was a dramatically different subsistence strategy from previous modes.<ref name=Ungar2006/><ref name=BenDor2011/>\n\n[[File:Elephasantiquus.jpg|thumb|upright=1|''H. erectus'' ate primarily large game, such as the [[straight-tusked elephant]] (above)]]\n''H. erectus'' sites frequently are associated with assemblages of medium- to large-sized game, namely [[elephant]]s, [[rhino]]s, [[hippo]]s, [[bovine]], and [[boar]]. This could potentially indicate high energy or dietary fat requirements, and a 2011 study calculated a [[energy homeostasis|daily energy expenditure]] (DEE) of 2,700\u20133,400 calories of which 27\u201344% derived from fat, and 44\u201362% of the fat from animal sources. In comparison, modern humans with a similar activity level have a DEE of 2,450 calories, of which 33% derives from fat, and 49% of the fat from animals. ''H. erectus'' would have had considerable leftovers, potentially pointing to food sharing or long-term food preservation (such as by drying) if most of the kill was indeed utilized. It is possible that ''H. erectus'' grew to become quite dependent on large-animal meat, and the disappearance of ''H. erectus'' from the [[Levant]] is correlated with the local extinction of the [[straight-tusked elephant]].<ref name=BenDor2011>{{cite journal|first=M.|last=Ben-Dor|first2=A.|last2=Gopher|first3=I.|last3=Hershkovitz|first4=R.|last4=Barkai|year=2011|title=Man the Fat Hunter: The Demise of ''Homo erectus'' and the Emergence of a New Hominin Lineage in the Middle Pleistocene (ca. 400 kyr) Levant|journal=PLoS One|volume=6|issue=12|page=e28689|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0028689|pmc=3235142|pmid=22174868}}</ref> Nonetheless, ''H. erectus'' diet likely varied widely depending upon location.

Enamel prevents the tooth from breaking from hard foods, but impedes shearing through tough foods. The [[Mandible#Body|bodies of the mandibles]] of ''H. erectus'', and all early ''Homo'', are thicker than those of modern humans and all living apes. The mandibular body resists torsion from the [[bite force]] or chewing, meaning their jaws could produce unusually powerful stresses while eating, but is unclear what this indicates in regards to diet. Nonetheless, the mandibular bodies of ''H. erectus'' are somewhat thinner than those of early ''Homo''. The premolars and molars also have a higher frequency of pits than ''H. habilis'', suggesting ''H. erectus'' ate more brittle foods (which cause pitting). These all indicate that the ''H. erectus'' mouth was less capable of processing hard foods and more at shearing through tougher foods, thus reducing the variety of foods it could process. However, tools were likely used to process hard foods, thus affecting the chewing apparatus, and this combination may have instead increased dietary flexibility (though this does not equate to a highly varied diet).

''H. erectus'' was the first fossil [[hominin]] found as a result of a directed expedition.\n\nExcavated from the bank of the [[Solo River]] at [[Trinil]], [[East Java]], he first allocated the material to a genus of fossil chimpanzees as ''Anthropopithecus erectus'', then the following year assigned it to a new genus as ''[[Pithecanthropus]] erectus'' (the genus name had been coined by [[Ernst Haeckel]] in 1868 for the hypothetical link between humans and fossil Apes). The species name ''erectus'' was given because the femur suggested that Java Man had been [[biped]]al and walked upright.

However, it is also plausible that the energy-expensive guts decreased in size in ''H. erectus'', because the large ape gut is used to synthesize fat fly fermenting plant matter which was replaced by dietary animal fat, allowing more energy to be diverted to brain growth. This would have increased brain size indirectly while maintaining the same caloric requirements of ancestor species. ''H. erectus'' may have also been the first to use a [[Hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]] food collecting strategy as a response to the increasing dependence on meat. With an emphasis on teamwork, division of labor, and food sharing, hunting and gathering was a dramatically different subsistence strategy from previous modes.<ref name=Ungar2006/><ref name=BenDor2011/>\n\n[[File:Elephasantiquus.jpg|thumb|upright=1|''H. erectus'' ate primarily large game, such as the [[straight-tusked elephant]] (above)]]\n''H. erectus'' sites frequently are associated with assemblages of medium- to large-sized game, namely [[elephant]]s, [[rhino]]s, [[hippo]]s, [[bovine]], and [[boar]]. This could potentially indicate high energy or dietary fat requirements, and a 2011 study calculated a [[energy homeostasis|daily energy expenditure]] (DEE) of 2,700\u20133,400 calories of which 27\u201344% derived from fat, and 44\u201362% of the fat from animal sources. In comparison, modern humans with a similar activity level have a DEE of 2,450 calories, of which 33% derives from fat, and 49% of the fat from animals. ''H. erectus'' would have had considerable leftovers, potentially pointing to food sharing or long-term food preservation (such as by drying) if most of the kill was indeed utilized. It is possible that ''H. erectus'' grew to become quite dependent on large-animal meat, and the disappearance of ''H. erectus'' from the [[Levant]] is correlated with the local extinction of the [[straight-tusked elephant]].<ref name=BenDor2011>{{cite journal|first=M.|last=Ben-Dor|first2=A.|last2=Gopher|first3=I.|last3=Hershkovitz|first4=R.|last4=Barkai|year=2011|title=Man the Fat Hunter: The Demise of ''Homo erectus'' and the Emergence of a New Hominin Lineage in the Middle Pleistocene (ca. 400 kyr) Levant|journal=PLoS One|volume=6|issue=12|page=e28689|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0028689|pmc=3235142|pmid=22174868}}</ref> Nonetheless, ''H. erectus'' diet likely varied widely depending upon location.

Enamel prevents the tooth from breaking from hard foods, but impedes shearing through tough foods. The [[Mandible#Body|bodies of the mandibles]] of ''H. erectus'', and all early ''Homo'', are thicker than those of modern humans and all living apes. The mandibular body resists torsion from the [[bite force]] or chewing, meaning their jaws could produce unusually powerful stresses while eating, but is unclear what this indicates in regards to diet. Nonetheless, the mandibular bodies of ''H. erectus'' are somewhat thinner than those of early ''Homo''. The premolars and molars also have a higher frequency of pits than ''H. habilis'', suggesting ''H. erectus'' ate more brittle foods (which cause pitting). These all indicate that the ''H. erectus'' mouth was less capable of processing hard foods and more at shearing through tougher foods, thus reducing the variety of foods it could process. However, tools were likely used to process hard foods, thus affecting the chewing apparatus, and this combination may have instead increased dietary flexibility (though this does not equate to a highly varied diet).

This part of territory is, since 1997, [[Asinara National Park|a national park]].\n\nThe morphology of \"city part\" is flat; the area of Porto Torres and the rest part of north-west Sardinia is characterized by a [[Nurra]] flat, there are some hill formations in the middle of the flat. Part of this hill formation is in Porto Torres' territory and the highest elevation of it is Monte Alvaro with a height of 342&nbsp;m.\n\nThe communal territory is crossed by two rivers, Rio Mannu and Fiume Santo. The first draws the edge of Porto Torres territory on west, while instead the latter flows near the city and was used as a fluvial way as early as the [[ancient Rome|Roman age]].\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Roman bridge of Turris Libisonis, Porto Torres, Sardinia (16557754949).jpg|thumb|left|Roman bridge.]]\nIn ancient times, '''Turris Libyssonis''' was one of the most considerable cities in Sardinia. It was probably of purely [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] origin, founded apparently by [[Julius Caesar]], as it bore the title ''Colonia Julia''.<ref name=EB1911TurrisLibisonis>{{EB1911|wstitle=Turris Libisonis|inline=1}}</ref>  [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] described it as a [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]], the only on the island in his time, suggesting that there was previously no town on the spot, but merely a fort or ''castellum''.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1857|p=1241}} Cites: Plin. iii. 12. s. 17.</ref> It is noticed also by [[Ptolemy]] and in the [[Antonine Itinerary|Itineraries]], but without any indication that it was a place of any importance.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1857|p=1241}} Cites: Ptol. iii. 3. \u00a7 5; Itin.

This entitled Robidoux to be listed on official rankings, although he could not play in most competitions. In 1988, Robidoux amassed enough points in the World Championship qualifiers to finish in the top 128 players, and thus allowing him to join the tour full-time.\n\nIn September 1988, Robidoux became only the sixth player ever to record an officially ratified [[Highest snooker break|147 maximum break]] in the qualifiers for the [[Malta Cup|European Open]]. The same month, he won his sole professional title, the [[1988 Canadian Professional Championship|Canadian Professional Championship]]. In October 1988 he reached the semi-finals of the [[1988 Grand Prix (snooker)|Grand Prix]], where he recovered from 0\u20137 down against [[Alex Higgins]] but ultimately lost the match 7\u20139.\n\nRobidoux's best ranking event performance was reaching the final of the [[1996 German Open (snooker)|1996 German Open]] when he lost 7\u20139 to [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]]. In the first round of the [[1996 World Snooker Championship|1996 World Championship]], Robidoux was beaten 3\u201310 by O'Sullivan again. Although he is predominantly right-handed, O'Sullivan played a number of shots with his left hand. This behaviour was described by commentator [[John Virgo]] as O'Sullivan \"[[Take the piss|taking the mick]]\". The matter came to a crux in the eleventh frame, with Robidoux 2\u20138 down, declining to concede the frame, instead continuing to {{Cuegloss|Snookers required|play for snookers}} despite a 43-point deficit with only the pink and black on the table. Robidoux refused to shake O'Sullivan's hand at the end of the match. \nO'Sullivan responded by claiming that he played better with his left hand than Robidoux could with his right.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/anger-over-left-leaning-osullivan-1306125.html|title=Anger over left-leaning O'Sullivan|date=1996-04-22|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=2018-12-23}}</ref>\n\nRobidoux reached the semi-finals of the [[1997 World Snooker Championship]], defeating [[Brian Morgan (snooker player)|Brian Morgan]], [[Stefan Mazrocis]] and [[Lee Walker]] before losing to eventual champion [[Ken Doherty]].

he played on the sport's [[World Snooker Tour|main tour]] from 1988 to 2005 and continues to play in events in Canada.\n\n==Career==\nHe was born in [[Saint-J\u00e9r\u00f4me, Quebec|Saint-J\u00e9r\u00f4me]], [[Quebec]] and joined the pro circuit in the late 1980s, playing as a \"non-tournament\" professional. This entitled Robidoux to be listed on official rankings, although he could not play in most competitions. In 1988, Robidoux amassed enough points in the World Championship qualifiers to finish in the top 128 players, and thus allowing him to join the tour full-time.\n\nIn September 1988, Robidoux became only the sixth player ever to record an officially ratified [[Highest snooker break|147 maximum break]] in the qualifiers for the [[Malta Cup|European Open]]. The same month, he won his sole professional title, the [[1988 Canadian Professional Championship|Canadian Professional Championship]]. In October 1988 he reached the semi-finals of the [[1988 Grand Prix (snooker)|Grand Prix]], where he recovered from 0\u20137 down against [[Alex Higgins]] but ultimately lost the match 7\u20139.\n\nRobidoux's best ranking event performance was reaching the final of the [[1996 German Open (snooker)|1996 German Open]] when he lost 7\u20139 to [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]]. In the first round of the [[1996 World Snooker Championship|1996 World Championship]], Robidoux was beaten 3\u201310 by O'Sullivan again. Although he is predominantly right-handed, O'Sullivan played a number of shots with his left hand. This behaviour was described by commentator [[John Virgo]] as O'Sullivan \"[[Take the piss|taking the mick]]\". The matter came to a crux in the eleventh frame, with Robidoux 2\u20138 down, declining to concede the frame, instead continuing to {{Cuegloss|Snookers required|play for snookers}} despite a 43-point deficit with only the pink and black on the table. Robidoux refused to shake O'Sullivan's hand at the end of the match. \nO'Sullivan responded by claiming that he played better with his left hand than Robidoux could with his right.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/anger-over-left-leaning-osullivan-1306125.html|title=Anger over left-leaning O'Sullivan|date=1996-04-22|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=2018-12-23}}</ref>\n\nRobidoux reached the semi-finals of the [[1997 World Snooker Championship]], defeating [[Brian Morgan (snooker player)|Brian Morgan]], [[Stefan Mazrocis]] and [[Lee Walker]] before losing to eventual champion [[Ken Doherty]]. He subsequently slid rapidly down the rankings.<ref name=\"SS 2009-05\">{{cite web\n |url= http://snookerscene.blogspot.com/2009/05/past-masters2.html\n |title=Past Masters #2\n |last=Hendon\n |first=David\n |work=Snooker Scene Blog: News, Opinion and Insight from the Green Baize\n |date=26 May 2009\n |location=Halesowen, England\n |publisher=Snooker Scene Magazine\n |accessdate=2010-01-17\n}}</ref> Robidoux blamed his decline on the destruction of his favourite [[Cue stick|cue]],<ref name=\"SS 2009-05\" /> which he referred to as \"the Eel\". But when he took it back for repairs to the man he bought it from, he objected to Robidoux having \nfixed a sponsor's logo to the butt end and smashed the cue into pieces. Several years later, Robidoux was asked whether the passage of time may have eased his anger towards the cue maker; he responded \"I want to kill him.\"<ref name=\"SS 2009-05\"/>\n[https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Robidoux+at+a+dead+end.-a060684232 Robidoux at a dead end.]\n\n==Performance and rankings timeline==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n!

{"title_page": "Echo chamber", "text_new": "{{about|the acoustic chamber|metaphorical echo chambers in media|Echo chamber (media)|other uses|Echo Chamber (disambiguation)}}\n{{Refimprove|date=March 2008}}\n\n[[image:Hallraum TU Dresden 2009-06-21.jpg|thumb|right|Echo chamber of the [[Dresden University of Technology]]]]\n[[image:Hamilton Mausoleum Interior.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hamilton Mausoleum]] has a long-lasting unplanned echo]]\n\nAn '''echo chamber''' is a hollow enclosure used to produce [[reverberation]], usually for [[Sound recording and reproduction|recording]] purposes.  For example, the producers of a [[television]] or [[radio]] program might wish to produce the aural illusion that a conversation is taking place in a large room or a cave; these effects can be accomplished by playing the recording of the conversation inside an echo chamber, with an accompanying [[microphone]] to catch the reverberation. Nowadays [[effects unit]]s are more widely used to create such effects, but echo chambers are still used today, such as the famous echo chambers at [[Capitol Studios]].\n\nIn music, the use of acoustic [[Echo (phenomenon)|echo]] and reverberation effects has taken many forms and dates back many hundreds of years. [[Medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] [[sacred music]] relied heavily on the composers' extensive understanding and use of the complex natural reverberation and echoes inside churches and cathedrals. This early acoustical knowledge informed the design of [[opera house]]s and [[concert hall]]s in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. Architects designed these to create internal reflections that would enhance and project sound from the stage in the days before electrical amplification. Sometimes echo effects were the unintentional side effect of the architectural or engineering design, such as for the [[Hamilton Mausoleum]] in Scotland, which has one of the longest reverberation times of any building.\n\n==Electro-acoustic==\n{{See also|Electromagnetic reverberation chamber}}\n\nDevelopments in electronics in the early 20th century\u2014specifically the invention of the [[amplifier]] and the [[microphone]]\u2014led to the creation of the first artificial echo chambers, built for radio and recording studios. Until the 1950s echo and reverberation were typically created by a combination of electrical and physical methods.\n\nAcoustically speaking, the \"classic novel\" echo chamber creates echoes in the same way as they are created in churches or caves\u2014they are all simply large, enclosed, empty spaces with floors and walls made of hard materials (such as polished stone or concrete) that reflect sound waves well. The basic purpose of such chambers is to add colour and depth to the original sound, and to simulate the rich natural reverberation that is a feature of large concert halls.\n\nThe development of artificial echo/reverberation chambers was important for sound recording because of the limitations of early recording systems. Except in the case of live performances, most commercial popular recordings were made in specially constructed studios. These rooms were both heavily insulated to exclude external noises and internally somewhat [[Anechoic chamber|anechoic]]\u2014that is, they were designed not to produce any internal echoes or sound reverberation.\n\nBecause virtually every sound in everyday life is a complex mixture of direct sound from the source and its echoes and reverberations, audiences naturally found the totally 'dry' and reverberation-free sound of early recordings unappealing. Consequently, record producers and engineers quickly came up with an effective method of adding 'artificial' echo and reverberation that experts could control with a remarkable degree of accuracy.\n\nProducing echo and reverberation in this form of echo chamber is simple. A signal from the studio mixing desk\u2014such as a voice or instrument\u2014is fed to a large high-fidelity [[loudspeaker]] located at one end of the chamber. One or more microphones are placed along the length of the room and these pick up both the sound from the speaker and its reflections off the walls of the chamber. The farther away from the loudspeaker, the more echo and reverberation the microphone(s) picks up and the louder the reverberation becomes in relation to the source. The signal from the microphone line is then fed back to the mixing desk, where the echo/reverberation-enhanced sound can be blended with the original 'dry' input.\n\nAn example of this physical effect can be heard on the 1978 [[David Bowie]] song [[Heroes (David Bowie song)|\"Heroes\"]], from the album of the same name. The song, produced by [[Tony Visconti]], was recorded in the large concert hall in the Hansa recording studio in Berlin and Visconti has since been much praised for the striking sound he achieved on Bowie's vocals. Visconti placed three microphones at intervals along the length of the hall, one very close to Bowie, one halfway down the hall and the third at the far end of the hall. During the recording, Bowie sang each verse progressively louder than the last and as he increased volume in each verse, Visconti opened up each of the three microphones in turn, from closest to farthest. Thus, in the first verse, Bowie's voice sounds close, warm and present; by the end of the song, Visconti has mixed in a large amount of signal from all three microphones, giving Bowie's voice a strikingly reverberant sound.\n\nThe original echo chamber at EMI's [[Abbey Road Studios]] was improved by the late Clive Robinson, who was site foreman at the time of construction. His construction and engineering team perfected the echo booth at Abbey Road Studios in London. It was one of the first studios in the world to be specially built for recording purposes when it was established in 1931; it remains in place and is a prime example of the early 20th-century electro-acoustic echo chamber.\n\nBuildings such as churches, church halls and ballrooms have often been chosen as recording sites for classical and other music because of their rich, 'natural' echo and reverberation characteristics. Famous examples include Sir [[George Martin]]'s AIR Studios at Lyndhurst Hall in [[Belsize Park]], London, a large, vaulted 19th century building originally constructed as a church and missionary school. Montreal's Church of St. Eustache is the favoured recording venue of the Montreal Symphony Orchestra and many others, and is much sought after for classical recordings because of its unique acoustic characteristics. The distinctive reverberation on the early hit records by [[Bill Haley & His Comets]] was created by recording the band under the domed ceiling of Decca's studio in [[New York City]], located in a former ballroom called The Pythian Temple.\n\nSome recording companies and many small independent labels could not afford large purpose-built echo chambers such as the Abbey Road chamber, so enterprising producers and engineers often made use of any large reverberant space. Corridors, lift-wells, stairwells, tiled bathrooms and toilets were all used as substitute echo chambers. Many famous [[soul music]] and [[R&B music]] recordings released by the New York-based [[Atlantic Records]] feature echo and reverb effects produced by simply placing a speaker and microphone in the office toilet\u2014a process also used by Producer/Engineer [[Bruce Botnick]] while recording  [[The Doors]] for their 1970 album ''[[L.A. Woman]]''.\n\n==Electronic echo machines==\n[[image:RE-501.jpg|thumb|The Roland RE-501 is an audio effects device capable of creating echo, chorus, reverb and sound on sound type effects]]\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, the development of magnetic audio tape technology made it possible to duplicate physical echo and reverberation effects entirely electronically. The [[Watkins Copicat]], designed and built by renowned British electronics engineer [[Charlie Watkins (audio engineer)|Charlie Watkins]] in the late 1950s, is typical of this kind of electronic delay device.\n\nTape echo units use an endless loop of magnetic tape, which is drawn across a series of recording and playback heads.\nWhen a signal from a voice or instrument is fed into the machine, it records the signal onto the tape loop as it passed over the record head. As the tape advances, the newly recorded signal is then picked up by a series of playback heads mounted in line with the record head. These play the sound back as the signal passes over each head in turn, creating the classic rippling or cascading echoes that are typical of tape echo units.\n\nThe number of playback heads determines the number of repeats, and the physical distance between each playback head determines the ratio of delay between each repeat of the sound (usually some fraction of a second). The actual length of the delay between each repeat can be varied by a pitch control that alters the speed of the tape loop across the heads.\n\nTypically, the playback heads of tape echo machines are also connected to controls that allow the user to determine the volume of each echo relative to the original signal. Another control (sometimes called  \"regeneration\") allows the signal from the playback heads to be fed back into and variably mixed with the original input signal, creating a distinctive \"[[feedback]]\" effect that adds more and more noise to the loop with each repeat.  If fully activated, this control ultimately produces a continuous feedback loop of pure noise. [[Roland RE-201|Roland]] manufactured various models of magnetic tape echo and reverb sound effect machines from 1973 until the introduction of digital sound effect machines.\n\nTape echo that has few repeats and a very short delay between each repeat is often referred to as \"[[slapback echo|slapback]]\" echo.  This distinctive sound is one of the key sonic characteristics of 1950s [[rock and roll]] and [[rockabilly]], and can be heard on the classic mid-50s [[Sun Records]] recordings by [[Elvis Presley]] and others. This effect was a result of the unintentional combination of the recording and monitoring tape heads (physically located a few inches apart) which, on playback, created a gap that inadvertently produced the iconic \"slap-back\" effect.\n\n===Digital echo===\n[[image:Maxon DE-01.jpg|thumb|Maxon DE-01 digital echo sound effect pedal]]\nWith the advent of [[digital signal processing]] and other [[digital audio]] technologies, it became possible to simulate almost every \"echo chamber\" effect by processing the signal digitally. Because digital devices are able to simulate an almost limitless variety of real reverberant spaces as well as replicate the classic tape-based echo effects, physical echo chambers fell into disuse.  However, as noted above, naturally reverberant spaces such as churches continue to be used as recording venues for classical and other forms of acoustic music.\n\n==Oil-can delay method==\nAn alternative echo system was the so-called \"oil-can delay\" method, which uses electrostatic rather than electromagnetic recording.<ref name=\"modd3d\">\n{{cite web \n|url=http://www.modd3d.com/articles/item/oil-can-delays\n|title=Oil Can Delays\n|author=Scott\n|date=2007-08-11\n|accessdate=2018-08-04\n}}</ref>\n\nInvented by [[Ray Lubow]], the oil-can method uses a rotating disc of anodized aluminium coated with a suspension of carbon particles. An AC signal to a conductive neoprene wiper transfers the high impedance charge to the disc. As the particles pass by the wiper, they act as thousands of tiny capacitors, holding a small part of the charge. A second wiper reads this representation of the signal, and sends it to a voltage amplifier that mixes it with the original source. To protect the charge held in each capacitor and to lubricate the entire assembly, the disc runs inside a sealed can with enough of a special oil{{efn|Union Carbide UCON lb65<ref name=\"modd3d\"/>}} to assure that an even coating is applied as it spins.<<ref>{{cite patent\n| country\t= US\n| number\t= 2892898\n| status\t= \n| title\t\t= Delay apparatus\n| pubdate\t= \n| gdate\t\t= \n| fdate\t\t= February 21, 1958\n| pridate\t= \n| inventor\t= Raymond Lubow\n| invent1\t= \n| invent2\t= \n| assign1\t= \n| assign2\t= \n| class\t\t= \n| url\t\t= https://patents.google.com/patent/US2892898?oq=patent:2892898\n}}</ref>\n\nThe effect resembles an echo, but the whimsical nature of the storage medium causes variations in the sound that can be heard as a vibrato effect.

Fender sold the Dimension IV, the Variable Delay, the Echo-Reverb I, II, and III, and included an oil can in their Special Effects box. Gibson sold the GA-4RE from 1965\u20137.

For example, the producers of a [[television]] or [[radio]] program might wish to produce the aural illusion that a conversation is taking place in a large room or a cave; these effects can be accomplished by playing the recording of the conversation inside an echo chamber, with an accompanying [[microphone]] to catch the reverberation. Nowadays [[effects unit]]s are more widely used to create such effects, but echo chambers are still used today, such as the famous echo chambers at [[Capitol Studios]].\n\nIn music, the use of acoustic [[Echo (phenomenon)|echo]] and reverberation effects has taken many forms and dates back many hundreds of years. [[Medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] [[sacred music]] relied heavily on the composers' extensive understanding and use of the complex natural reverberation and echoes inside churches and cathedrals. This early acoustical knowledge informed the design of [[opera house]]s and [[concert hall]]s in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. Architects designed these to create internal reflections that would enhance and project sound from the stage in the days before electrical amplification. Sometimes echo effects were the unintentional side effect of the architectural or engineering design, such as for the [[Hamilton Mausoleum]] in Scotland, which has one of the longest reverberation times of any building.\n\n==Electro-acoustic==\n{{See also|Electromagnetic reverberation chamber}}\n\nDevelopments in electronics in the early 20th century\u2014specifically the invention of the [[amplifier]] and the [[microphone]]\u2014led to the creation of the first artificial echo chambers, built for radio and recording studios. Until the 1950s echo and reverberation were typically created by a combination of electrical and physical methods.\n\nAcoustically speaking, the \"classic novel\" echo chamber creates echoes in the same way as they are created in churches or caves\u2014they are all simply large, enclosed, empty spaces with floors and walls made of hard materials (such as polished stone or concrete) that reflect sound waves well. The basic purpose of such chambers is to add colour and depth to the original sound, and to simulate the rich natural reverberation that is a feature of large concert halls.\n\nThe development of artificial echo/reverberation chambers was important for sound recording because of the limitations of early recording systems. Except in the case of live performances, most commercial popular recordings were made in specially constructed studios. These rooms were both heavily insulated to exclude external noises and internally somewhat [[Anechoic chamber|anechoic]]\u2014that is, they were designed not to produce any internal echoes or sound reverberation.\n\nBecause virtually every sound in everyday life is a complex mixture of direct sound from the source and its echoes and reverberations, audiences naturally found the totally 'dry' and reverberation-free sound of early recordings unappealing. Consequently, record producers and engineers quickly came up with an effective method of adding 'artificial' echo and reverberation that experts could control with a remarkable degree of accuracy.\n\nProducing echo and reverberation in this form of echo chamber is simple. A signal from the studio mixing desk\u2014such as a voice or instrument\u2014is fed to a large high-fidelity [[loudspeaker]] located at one end of the chamber. One or more microphones are placed along the length of the room and these pick up both the sound from the speaker and its reflections off the walls of the chamber. The farther away from the loudspeaker, the more echo and reverberation the microphone(s) picks up and the louder the reverberation becomes in relation to the source. The signal from the microphone line is then fed back to the mixing desk, where the echo/reverberation-enhanced sound can be blended with the original 'dry' input.\n\nAn example of this physical effect can be heard on the 1978 [[David Bowie]] song [[Heroes (David Bowie song)|\"Heroes\"]], from the album of the same name. The song, produced by [[Tony Visconti]], was recorded in the large concert hall in the Hansa recording studio in Berlin and Visconti has since been much praised for the striking sound he achieved on Bowie's vocals. Visconti placed three microphones at intervals along the length of the hall, one very close to Bowie, one halfway down the hall and the third at the far end of the hall. During the recording, Bowie sang each verse progressively louder than the last and as he increased volume in each verse, Visconti opened up each of the three microphones in turn, from closest to farthest. Thus, in the first verse, Bowie's voice sounds close, warm and present; by the end of the song, Visconti has mixed in a large amount of signal from all three microphones, giving Bowie's voice a strikingly reverberant sound.\n\nThe original echo chamber at EMI's [[Abbey Road Studios]] was improved by the late Clive Robinson, who was site foreman at the time of construction. His construction and engineering team perfected the echo booth at Abbey Road Studios in London. It was one of the first studios in the world to be specially built for recording purposes when it was established in 1931; it remains in place and is a prime example of the early 20th-century electro-acoustic echo chamber.\n\nBuildings such as churches, church halls and ballrooms have often been chosen as recording sites for classical and other music because of their rich, 'natural' echo and reverberation characteristics. Famous examples include Sir [[George Martin]]'s AIR Studios at Lyndhurst Hall in [[Belsize Park]], London, a large, vaulted 19th century building originally constructed as a church and missionary school. Montreal's Church of St. Eustache is the favoured recording venue of the Montreal Symphony Orchestra and many others, and is much sought after for classical recordings because of its unique acoustic characteristics. The distinctive reverberation on the early hit records by [[Bill Haley & His Comets]] was created by recording the band under the domed ceiling of Decca's studio in [[New York City]], located in a former ballroom called The Pythian Temple.\n\nSome recording companies and many small independent labels could not afford large purpose-built echo chambers such as the Abbey Road chamber, so enterprising producers and engineers often made use of any large reverberant space. Corridors, lift-wells, stairwells, tiled bathrooms and toilets were all used as substitute echo chambers. Many famous [[soul music]] and [[R&B music]] recordings released by the New York-based [[Atlantic Records]] feature echo and reverb effects produced by simply placing a speaker and microphone in the office toilet\u2014a process also used by Producer/Engineer [[Bruce Botnick]] while recording  [[The Doors]] for their 1970 album ''[[L.A. Woman]]''.\n\n==Electronic echo machines==\n[[image:RE-501.jpg|thumb|The Roland RE-501 is an audio effects device capable of creating echo, chorus, reverb and sound on sound type effects]]\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, the development of magnetic audio tape technology made it possible to duplicate physical echo and reverberation effects entirely electronically.
