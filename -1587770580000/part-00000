According to the 1897 [[Easton's Bible Dictionary]], it is possible that Malachi is not a [[proper name]], but simply means \"messenger of [[YHWH]]\".<ref name=\"Easton\">''[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/easton/ebd2.html?term=Malachi Malachi]'' at the [[Easton's Bible Dictionary]]</ref> The Greek Old Testament superscription is \u1f10\u03bd \u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u1f76 \u1f00\u03b3\u03b3\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6, (by the hand of his messenger).\n\n==Name==\nBecause Malachi's name does not occur elsewhere in the Bible, some scholars doubt whether \"Malachi\" is intended to be the personal name of the prophet. None of the other prophetic books of the Hebrew Bible or the Greek Old Testament are anonymous. The form ''mal'akhi'', signifies \"my messenger\"; it occurs in [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Malachi+3%3A1&version=NASB Malachi 3:1] (compare to [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Malachi+2.7&version=NASB Malachi 2:7]). But this form of itself would hardly be appropriate as a proper name without some additional syllable such as [[Theophoric name#Yahweh|Yah]], whence ''mal'akhiah'', i.e. \"messenger of Elohim.\" Haggai, in fact, is expressly designated \"messenger of Elohim\" ([http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_haggai01_sml.htm#haggai_1:13 Haggai 1:13]). Besides, the superscriptions prefixed to the book, in both the Septuagint and the [[Vulgate]], warrant the supposition that Malachi's full name ended with the syllable -yah. At the same time the Greek Old Testament translates the last clause of [http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_malachi01_sml.htm#malachi_1:1 Malachi 1:1], \"by the hand of his messenger,\" and the [[Targum]] reads, \"by the hand of my angel, whose name is called Ezra the scribe.\" <ref name=\"bibler.org\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bibler.org/glossary/malachi.html |title=www.Bibler.org - Dictionary - Malachi |date=2012-08-07}}</ref>\n\n==Works==\n[[File:Tissot Malachi.jpg|thumb|150px|Malachi (watercolor circa 1896\u20131902 by [[James Tissot]])]]\nThe Jews of his day ascribed the Book of Malachi, the last book of prophecy, to Ezra, but if Ezra's name was originally associated with the book, it would hardly have been dropped by the collectors of the prophetic canon who lived only a century or two after Ezra's time. Certain traditions ascribe the book to [[Zerubbabel]] and Nehemiah; others, still, to Malachi, whom they designate as a [[Levite]] and a member of the \"Great Synagogue.\" Certain modern scholars, however, on the basis of the similarity of the title (compare [http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_malachi01_sml.htm#malachi_1:1 Malachi 1:1] to [http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_zechariah09_sml.htm#zechariah_9:1 Zechariah 9:1] and [http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_zechariah12_sml.htm#zechariah_12:1 Zechariah 12:1]), declare it to be anonymous. Professor G.G. Cameron, suggests that the termination of the word \"Malachi\" is adjectival, and equivalent to the Latin angelicus, signifying \"one charged with a message or mission\" (a missionary). The term would thus be an official title, and the thought would not be unsuitable to one whose message closed the prophetical canon of the Old Testament.<ref name=\"bibler.org\"/>\n\n==Period==\nOpinions vary as to the prophet's exact date, but nearly all scholars agree that Malachi prophesied during the [[Jerusalem during the Second Temple Period|Persian period]], and after the reconstruction and dedication of the second temple in 516 BCE (compare [http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_malachi01_sml.htm#malachi_1:10 Malachi 1:10] ; [http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_malachi03_sml.htm#malachi_3:1 Malachi 3:1], [http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_malachi03_sml.htm#malachi_3:10 Malachi 3:10]). The prophet speaks of the \"people's governor\" (Hebrew \"pechah\", [http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_malachi01_sml.htm#malachi_1:8 Malachi 1:8]), as do Haggai and Nehemiah ([http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_haggai01_sml.htm#haggai_1:1 Haggai 1:1] ; [http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_nehemiah05_sml.htm#nehemiah_5:14 Nehemiah 5:14] ; [http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_nehemiah12_sml.htm#nehemiah_12:26 Nehemiah 12:26]). The social conditions portrayed appear to be those of the period of the Restoration. More specifically, Malachi probably lived and labored during the times of Ezra and Nehemiah. The abuses which Malachi mentions in his writings correspond so exactly with those which Nehemiah found on his second visit to Jerusalem in 432 BCE ([http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_nehemiah13_sml.htm#nehemiah_13:7 Nehemiah 13:7]) that it seems reasonably certain that he prophesied concurrently with Nehemiah or shortly after.<ref name=\"bibler.org\"/>\n\nAccording to Rabbi W. Gunther Plaut, \"Malachi describes a priesthood that is forgetful of its duties, a Temple that is underfunded because the people have lost interest in it, and a society in which Jewish men divorce their Jewish wives to marry out of the faith.\"<ref>[https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/haggai-zechariah-and-malachi-back-in-the-land/ Plaut, W.

He then led NBC's coverage of US military operations for the war in Afghanistan, and the hunt for Osama Bin Laden, the mastermind behind the 9/11 attack on America.\n\nMiklaszewski's broadcast career began in West Texas at radio stations KVOP in Plainview and KLBK in Lubbock. He then spent several years as a News Director/Reporter for several radio stations in Madison and La Crosse, Wisconsin and in Fort Worth, Texas.\n\nIn 1980 Miklaszewski signed on as one of the \"CNN Originals\" where he quickly logged considerable battlefield experience covering the wars in Lebanon, El Salvador and the Falkland Islands.  CNN later assigned him to the President Reagan White House where he reported on the terrorist attack that killed 220 Marines in Lebanon, the US military invasion of Grenada, and the President and Mrs. Reagan's trip to China. \n\nNBC hired Miklaszewski first as a Pentagon correspondent in 1985 where he joined US forces during the \"Tanker Wars\" in the Persian Gulf.  Jim was later assigned to cover President George Bush \"41\" during the first Gulf War with Iraq, and summits with Mikhail Gorbachev, and Boris Yeltsin. He remained in the White House for President Clinton's first term and reelection.  Mik returned to the Pentagon where he covered the 9/11 attack, the US invasion of Iraq ordered by President George W. Bush, and ultimately the US Navy Seals operation that killed Osama bin Laden.\n\nDuring his career Jim received an Emmy for his reporting on the Russian shootdown of Malaysia Flight 17, an Edward R. Murrow award for his series, \"After Nam\" a documentary on the Vietnam war, and a Cable Industray award for his coverage of the war in El Salvador.\n\nHe retired from NBC on September 28, 2016.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{C-SPAN|Jim Miklaszewski}}\n\n{{NBC News Personalities}}\n\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Miklaszewski, Jim}}\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:NBC News people]]\n[[Category:1949 births]]\n[[Category:Radio personalities from Milwaukee]]\n[[Category:American male journalists]]\n[[Category:American television reporters and correspondents]]\n[[Category:People from Cudahy, Wisconsin]]\n\n\n{{US-tv-journalist-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{BLP sources|date=March 2010}}\n{{Infobox person\n| name        = Jim Miklaszewski\n| image       =\n| caption     =\n| birthname   =\n| birth_date  =  {{birth date and age|1949|7|8}}\n| birth_place = [[Cudahy, Wisconsin]]\n| death_date  =\n| death_place =\n| education   =\n| occupation  = [[Correspondent]]\n| alias       =\n| title       = [[NBC News]] Chief Pentagon Correspondent\n| family      =\n| spouse      = Cheryl Heyse\n| domestic_partner =\n| children    = James and Jeffrey\n| relatives   =\n| ethnicity   =\n| religion    =\n| salary      =\n| networth    =\n| credits     =\n| agent       =\n| URL         = [https://web.archive.org/web/20040215172231/http://msnbc.msn.com/id/3688835/] NBC News Biography\n}}\n\n'''James Alan Miklaszewski''' (born 8 July 1949), better known as '''Jim''' or '''Mik Miklaszewski''', is a retired journalist.

Digital identities allow our access to computers and the services they provide to be automated, and make it possible for computers to mediate relationships.\n\nThe term \"digital identity\" also denotes certain aspects of civil and personal identity that have resulted from the widespread use of identity information to represent people in an acceptable trusted digital format in computer systems. \n\nAccording to Feher's academic approach: digital identity \"refers to the digital data corpus being built by users and digital systems\" <ref>[[Katalin Feh\u00e9r]] [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0165551519879702 Digital identity and the online self: Footprint strategies \u2013 An exploratory and comparative research study, Journal of Information Science 2019]</ref> \n\nDigital identity is now often used in ways that require data about persons stored in computer systems to be linked to their civil, or national, identities. Furthermore, the use of digital identities are now so widespread that many discussions refer to \"digital identity\" as the entire collection of information generated by a person\u2019s online activity. This includes usernames and passwords, online search activities, birth date, social security, and purchasing history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.techopedia.com/definition/23915/digital-identity|title=What is a Digital Identity? - Definition from Techopedia|access-date=2016-10-01}}</ref>  Especially where that information is publicly available and not anonymized, and can be used by others to discover that person's civil identity. In this wider sense, a digital identity is a version, or facet, of a person's social identity. This may also be referred to as an [[online identity]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Global|first=IndraStra|title=Digital Identity \u2013 A Gateway to All Other Use Cases|url=http://www.indrastra.com/2018/01/Digital-Identity-Gateway-to-All-Other-Use-Cases-004-01-2018-0034.html|journal=IndraStra|issn=2381-3652}}</ref>\n\nThe legal and social effects of digital identity are complex and challenging. However, they are simply a consequence of the increasing use of computers, and the need to provide computers with information that can be used to identify external agents.\n\n==Background==\n\nA critical problem in [[cyberspace]] is knowing with whom one is interacting. Using static identifiers such as password and email there are no ways to precisely determine the identity of a person in digital space, because this information can be stolen or used by many individuals acting as one. Digital identity based on dynamic entity relationships captured from behavioral history across multiple websites and mobile apps can verify and authenticate an identity with up to [https://www.digitalidentityguide.com/what-is-a-digital-identity/ 95 percent accuracy].\n\nBy comparing a set of entity relationships between a new event (e.g., login) and past events, a pattern of [https://www.digitalidentityguide.com/digital-dna/ convergence] can verify or authenticate the identity as legitimate where divergence indicates an attempt to mask an identity. Data used for digital identity is generally [https://www.digitalidentityguide.com/digital-dna/ anonymized] using a one-way hash, thereby avoiding privacy concerns. Because it is based on behavioral history, a digital identity is impossible to fake or steal.\n\n==Related terms==\n\n===Subject and entity===\nA digital identity may also be referred to as a digital subject or digital [[wikt:entity|entity]] and is the digital representation of a set of claims made by one party about itself or another person, group, thing or concept.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.eclipse.org/Digital_Identity|title=Digital Identity - Eclipsepedia|website=wiki.eclipse.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Deh|first=Dragana|last2=Glo\u0111ovi\u0107|first2=Danica|date=2018-09-05|title=The Construction of Identity in Digital Space|journal=AM Journal of Art and Media Studies|language=en|volume=0|issue=16|pages=101|doi=10.25038/am.v0i16.257|issn=2406-1654|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n===Attributes, preferences and traits===\nEvery digital identity has zero or more identity attributes. Attributes are acquired and contain information about a subject, such as medical history, purchasing behaviour, bank balance, age and so on.<ref name=Windley>{{cite book |first=Phillip J. |last=Windley |title=Digital Identity |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |year=2005 |pages=8\u20139 |isbn=978-0596008789}}</ref> Preferences retain a subject's choices such as favourite brand of shoes, preferred currency. Traits are features of the subject that are inherent, such as eye colour, nationality, place of birth. While [[Attribute (computing)|attributes]] of a subject can change easily, traits change slowly, if at all. Digital identity also has entity relationships derived from the devices, environment and locations from which an individual transacts on the web.\n\n=== Rhetoric ===\nThe term \"digital identity\" is used in digital rhetoric field to denote identity as a \"rhetorical construction.\"<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Eyman|first=Douglas|title=Digital Rhetoric: Theory, Method, Practice|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=78}}</ref> Formation of digital identities is one of the main focuses of digital rhetoricians.

The construction of digital identity is also tied to the network. This can be seen from the practices of reputation management companies which work on creating positive identity so that accounts show up higher in various search engines. <ref name=\":2\" />  \n\n==Technical aspects==\n\n===Issuance===\nDigital identities can be issued through [[digital certificates]], which act the same way passports do in the physical world. They contain data which is associated with a user, and are issued with legal guarantees by a recognized [[Certificate authority|certification authority]] (CA).\n\n===Trust, authentication and authorization===\nIn order to assign a digital representation to an entity, the attributing party must trust that the claim of an attribute (such as name, location, role as an employee, or age) is correct and associated with the person or thing presenting the attribute (see [[Digital identity#Authentication|Authentication]] below). Conversely, the individual claiming an attribute may only grant selective access to its information, e.g. (proving identity in a bar or PayPal authentication for payment at a web site). In this way, digital identity is better understood as a particular viewpoint within a mutually-agreed relationship than as an objective property.\n\n====Authentication====\n[[Authentication]] is a key aspect of trust-based identity attribution, providing a codified assurance of the identity of one entity to another. Authentication methodologies include the presentation of a unique object such as a [[bank credit card]], the provision of confidential information such as a [[password]] or the answer to a pre-arranged question, the confirmation of ownership of an e-mail address, and more robust but relatively costly solutions utilizing [[encryption]] methodologies. In general, business-to-business authentication prioritises security while user to business authentication tends towards simplicity. Physical authentication techniques such as [[iris scan]]ning, handprinting, and [[Speaker recognition|voiceprinting]] are currently being developed and in the hope of providing improved protection against [[identity theft]]. Those techniques fall into the area of Biometry ([[biometrics]]). A combination of static identifiers (username & passwords) along with personal unique attributes (biometrics), would allow for [[Multi-factor authentication|multi factor authentication]]. This process would yield more creditable authentication, which in nature is much more difficult to be cracked and manipulated.\n\nWhilst technological progress in authentication continues to evolve, these systems do not prevent aliases from being used. The introduction of [[strong authentication]]{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} for online payment transactions within the [[European Union]] now links a verified person to an account, where such person has been identified in accordance with statutory requirements prior to account being opened. Verifying a person opening an account online typically requires a form of device binding to the credentials being used. This verifies that the device that stands in for a person on the Web is actually the individuals device and not the device of someone simply claiming to be the individual. The concept of [[reliance authentication]] makes use of pre-existing accounts, to piggy back further services upon those accounts, providing that the original source is reliable. The concept of reliability comes from various anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism funding legislation in the USA,<ref>http://www.ffiec.gov/pdf/bsa_aml_examination_manual2006.pdf</ref> EU28,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52013PC0045:EN:NOT|title=EUR-Lex - 52013PC0045 - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu}}</ref> Australia,<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2013C00371 | title=Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006}}</ref> Singapore and New Zealand<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dia.govt.nz/diawebsite.nsf/wpg_URL/Services-Anti-Money-Laundering-AMLCFT-Act-and-Regulations|title=AML/CFT Act and Regulations|first=The Department of Internal|last=Affairs|website=www.dia.govt.nz}}</ref> where second parties may place reliance on the customer due diligence process of the first party, where the first party is say a financial institution. An example of reliance authentication is PayPal's verification method.\n\n====Authorization====\n[[Authorization (computer access control)|Authorization]] is the determination of any entity that controls resources that the authenticated can access those resources.  Authorization depends on authentication, because authorization requires that the critical attribute (i.e., the attribute that determines the authorizer's decision) must be verified.  For example, authorization on a credit card gives access to the resources owned by [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]], e.g., Amazon sends one a product. Authorization of an employee will provide that employee with access to network resources, such as printers, files, or software.   For example, a database management system might be designed so as to provide certain specified individuals with the ability to retrieve information from a database but not the ability to change data stored in the database, while giving other individuals the ability to change data.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nConsider the person who rents a car and checks into a hotel with a credit card. The car rental and hotel company may request authentication that there is credit enough for an accident, or profligate spending on room service.  Thus a card may later be refused when trying to purchase an activity such as a balloon trip. Though there is adequate credit to pay for the rental, the hotel, and the balloon trip, there is an insufficient amount to also cover the authorizations. The actual charges are authorized after leaving the hotel and returning the car, which may be too late for the balloon trip.\n\nValid online authorization requires analysis of information related to the digital event including device and environmental variables. These are generally derived from the [https://www.digitalidentityguide.com/what-is-a-digital-identity/ hundreds of entities] exchanged between a device and business server to support an event using standard Internet protocols.\n\n===Digital identifiers===\nDigital identity fundamentally requires digital identifiers\u2014strings or tokens that are unique within a given scope (globally or locally within a specific domain, community, directory, application, etc.). Identifiers are the key used by the parties to an identification relationship to agree on the entity being represented. Identifiers may be classified as ''omnidirectional'' and ''unidirectional''.<ref>{{cite news |last=Cameron |first=Kim |title=The Laws of Identity |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms996456 |work=msdn.microsoft.com |publisher=Microsoft |date=May 2005}}</ref> Omnidirectional identifiers are intended to be public and easily discoverable, while unidirectional identifiers are intended to be private and used only in the context of a specific identity relationship.\n\nIdentifiers may also be classified as resolvable or non-resolvable. Resolvable identifiers, such as a [[domain name]] or [[e-mail address]], may be dereferenced into the entity they represent, or some current state data providing relevant attributes of that entity.  Non-resolvable identifiers, such as a person's real-world name, or a subject or topic name, can be compared for equivalence but are not otherwise machine-understandable.\n\nThere are many different schemes and formats for digital identifiers. The most widely used is [[Uniform Resource Identifier]] (URI) and its internationalized version [[Internationalized Resource Identifier]] (IRI)\u2014the standard for identifiers on the [[World Wide Web]]. [[OpenID]] and [[Light-Weight Identity]] (LID) are two web authentication protocols that use standard [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] URIs (often called URLs), for example.\n\n===Digital Object Architecture===\nDigital Object Architecture (DOA)<ref>{{cite news |first1=Robert |last1=Kahn |first2=Robert |last2=Wilensky |title=A Framework for Distributed Digital Object Services |url=http://www.cnri.reston.va.us/k-w.html |publisher=Corporation for National Research Initiatives |date=May 13, 1995}}</ref> provides a means of managing digital information in a network environment. A digital object has a machine and platform independent structure that allows it to be identified, accessed and protected, as appropriate. A digital object may incorporate not only informational elements, i.e., a digitized version of a paper, movie or sound recording, but also the unique identifier of the digital object and other metadata about the digital object. The metadata may include restrictions on access to digital objects, notices of ownership, and identifiers for licensing agreements, if appropriate.\n\n===Handle System===\nThe [[Handle System]] is a general purpose distributed information system that provides efficient, extensible, and secure identifier and resolution services for use on networks such as the internet. It includes an open set of protocols, a [[namespace]], and a reference implementation of the protocols. The protocols enable a [[distributed computing|distributed computer system]] to store identifiers, known as handles, of arbitrary resources and resolve those handles into the information necessary to locate, access, contact, authenticate, or otherwise make use of the resources. This information can be changed as needed to reflect the current state of the identified resource without changing its identifier, thus allowing the name of the item to persist over changes of location and other related state information. The original version of the Handle System technology was developed with support from the [[DARPA|Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)]].\n\n===Extensible Resource Identifiers===\nA new [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]] standard for abstract, structured identifiers, [[XRI]] (Extensible Resource Identifiers), adds new features to URIs and IRIs that are especially useful for digital identity systems. [[OpenID]] also supports XRIs, and XRIs are the basis for [[i-name]]s.\n\n===Risk-based authentication===\n\nRisk-based authentication is an application of digital identity whereby multiple entity relationship from the device (e.g., operating system), environment (e.g., DNS Server) and data entered by a user for any given transaction is evaluated for correlation with events from known behaviors for the same identity.<ref>https://www.forrester.com/report/The+Forrester+Wave+RiskBased+Authentication+Q3+2017/-/E-RES121265</ref> Analysis are performed based on quantifiable metrics, such as transaction velocity, locale settings (or attempts to obfuscate), and user-input data (such as ship-to address). Correlation and deviation are mapped to tolerances and scored, then aggregated across multiple entities to compute a transaction risk-score, which assess the risk posed to an organization.\n\n===Policy aspects===\nThere are proponents of treating self-determination and freedom of expression of digital identity as a new [[Human rights|human right]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}  Some have speculated that digital identities could become a new form of [[Juristic person|legal entity]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sullivan|first1=Clare|title=Digital Identity and Mistake|journal=International Journal of Law and Technology|volume=20|issue=3|pages=223\u2013241|date=2012|doi=10.1093/ijlit/eas015}}</ref>\n\n===Taxonomies of identity===\nDigital identity attributes\u2014or data\u2014exist within the context of [[Ontology (computer science)|ontologies]].\n\nThe development of digital identity network solutions that can interoperate taxonomically-diverse representations of digital identity is a contemporary challenge. [[Folksonomy|Free-tagging]] has emerged recently as an effective way of circumventing this challenge (to date, primarily with application to the identity of digital entities such as bookmarks and photos) by effectively flattening identity attributes into a single, unstructured layer. However, the organic integration of the benefits of both structured and fluid approaches to identity attribute management remains elusive.\n\n===Networked identity===\nIdentity relationships within a digital network may include multiple identity entities. However, in a decentralised network like the Internet, such extended identity relationships effectively require both (a) the existence of independent trust relationships between each pair of entities in the relationship and (b) a means of reliably integrating the paired relationships into larger relational units. And if identity relationships are to reach beyond the context of a single, federated ontology of identity (see [[#Taxonomies of identity|Taxonomies of identity]] above), identity attributes must somehow be matched across diverse ontologies. The development of network  approaches that can embody such integrated \"compound\" trust relationships is currently a topic of much debate in the [[blogosphere]].\n\nIntegrated compound trust relationships allow, for example, entity A to accept an assertion or claim about entity B by entity C. C thus vouches for an aspect of B's identity to A.\n\nA key feature of \"compound\" trust relationships is the possibility of selective disclosure from one entity to another of locally relevant information. As an illustration of the potential application of selective disclosure, let us suppose a certain Diana wished to book a hire car without disclosing irrelevant personal information (utilising a notional digital identity network that supports compound trust relationships). As an adult, UK resident with a current driving license, Diana might have the UK's [[Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency]] vouch for her driving qualification, age and nationality to a car-rental company without having her name or contact details disclosed. Similarly, Diana's bank might assert just her banking details to the rental company.  Selective disclosure allows for appropriate [[privacy]] of information within a network of identity relationships.\n\nA classic form of networked digital identity based on international standards is the \"White Pages\".\n\nAn electronic white pages links various devices, like computers and telephones, to an individual or organization. Various attributes such as X.509v3 digital certificates for secure cryptographic communications are captured under a schema, and published in an [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol|LDAP]] or [[X.500]] directory. Changes to the LDAP standard are managed by working groups in the [[IETF]], and changes in X.500 are managed by the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]. The ITU did significant analysis of gaps in digital identity interoperability via the FGidm, focus group on [[identity management]].\n\nImplementations of X.500[2005] and LDAPv3 have occurred worldwide but are primarily located in major data centers with administrative policy boundaries regarding sharing of personal information. Since combined X.500 [2005] and LDAPv3 directories can hold millions of unique objects for rapid access, it is expected to play a continued role for large scale secure identity access services. LDAPv3 can act as a lightweight standalone server, or in the original design as a TCP-IP based Lightweight Directory Access Protocol compatible with making queries to a X.500 mesh of servers which can run the native OSI protocol.\n\nThis will be done by scaling individual servers into larger groupings that represent defined \"administrative domains\", (such as the country level digital object) which can add value not present in the original \"White Pages\" that was used to look up phone numbers and email addresses, largely now available through non-authoritative search engines.\n\nThe ability to leverage and extend a networked digital identity is made more practicable by the expression of the level of trust associated with the given identity through a common [[Identity Assurance Framework]].\n\n===Blockchain-based digital identity===\nSeveral attempts have been made to create digital identity systems based on append-only databases, such as [[blockchain]]s. These solutions often market themselves toward users who enjoy peer-to-peer applications or who may have concerns about identity systems managed by central parties.\n\nIn 2018, [[Edinburgh Napier University]] partnered with [[Blockpass]], a blockchain-based self-sovereign [[Digital identity certificate|identity protocol]], to open a research lab at the University<ref>https://www.napier.ac.uk/about-us/our-schools/school-of-computing/student-stories/blockchain</ref>. The lab focuses on how blockchain technology and [[cryptography]] can protect personal data and digital identities from modern threats such as online [[hackers]] and malicious actors.\n\n==Security issues and privacy==\nSeveral writers have pointed out the tension between ubiquitous services that consume digital identity on the one hand and privacy on the other.<ref name=Camp>{{cite news |first=L.

[[General Data Protection Regulation|GDPR]] is one attempt to address this concern using regulation.\n\nMany systems provide privacy-related mitigations when analyzing data linked to digital identities. One common mitigation is [[data anonymization]], such as hashing user identifiers with a [[cryptographic hash function]]. Another popular technique is adding statistical noise to a data set to reduce identifiability, such as with [[differential privacy]].\n\nWhile a digital identity allows consumers to transact from anywhere and more easily manage various ID cards, it also poses a potential single point of compromise that malicious hackers can use to steal all of that personal information.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cutimes.com/2019/11/22/digital-identities-abound-few-understand-how-they-work/|title=Digital Identities Abound & Few Understand How They Work|last=November 22|first=Tina Orem {{!}}|last2=PM|first2=2019 at 12:31|website=Credit Union Times|language=en|access-date=2020-02-24}}</ref>\n\n==Legal issues==\nClare Sullivan presents the grounds for digital identity as an emerging legal concept.<ref name=Sullivan>{{cite book |first=Clare |last=Sullivan |url=http://www.adelaide.edu.au/press/titles/digital-identity/ |title=Digital Identity |publisher=The University of Adelaide |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-9807230-0-7|doi=10.1017/UPO9780980723007 }}</ref> The UK's [[Identity Cards Act 2006]] confirms Sullivan's argument and unfolds the new legal concept involving database identity and transaction identity. Database identity refers to the collection of data that is registered about an individual within the databases of the scheme and transaction identity is a set of information that defines the individual's identity for transactional purposes. Although there is reliance on the verification of identity, none of the processes used are entirely trustworthy. The consequences of digital identity abuse and fraud are potentially serious, since in possible implications the person is held legally responsible.<ref name=Sullivan/>\n\n==Business aspects==\nCorporations have begun to recognize the Internet's potential to facilitate the tailoring of the online storefront to each individual customer. Purchase suggestions, [[personalized advertisement|personalised adverts]] and other tailored marketing strategies are a great success to businesses.

For example, [[Digital identity in Australia]] can utilize services that validate [[Driving licences]], [[Passports]] and other physical documents online to help improve the quality of a digital identity, also strict [[Money laundering#Australia|Anti-money laundering]] policies mean that some services, such as money transfers need a stricter level of validation of digital identity.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Digital footprint]]\n* [[E-authentication]]\n* [[Federated identity]]\n* [[Informational self-determination]]\n* [[Privacy by design]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Digital Identity}}\n[[Category:Identity management]]\n[[Category:Digital technology]]\n[[Category:Federated identity]]\n[[Category:Computer access control]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{Technical|date=December 2009}}\n{{more citations needed|date=September 2013}}\n{{original research|date=September 2013}}\n{{cleanup reorganize|date=November 2017}}\n{{confusing|date=November 2017}}\n{{tone|date=November 2017}}\n{{unfocused|date=November 2017}}\n}}\n<!-- many terms should be wikilinked and/or defined. -->\n\nA '''digital identity''' is information on an entity used by [[Computer|computer systems]] to represent an external agent.

Digital identities allow our access to computers and the services they provide to be automated, and make it possible for computers to mediate relationships.\n\nThe term \"digital identity\" also denotes certain aspects of civil and personal identity that have resulted from the widespread use of identity information to represent people in an acceptable trusted digital format in computer systems. \n\nAccording to Feher's academic approach: digital identity \"refers to the digital data corpus being built by users and digital systems\" <ref>[[Katalin Feh\u00e9r]] [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0165551519879702 Digital identity and the online self: Footprint strategies \u2013 An exploratory and comparative research study, Journal of Information Science 2019]</ref> \n\nDigital identity is now often used in ways that require data about persons stored in computer systems to be linked to their civil, or national, identities. Furthermore, the use of digital identities are now so widespread that many discussions refer to \"digital identity\" as the entire collection of information generated by a person\u2019s online activity. This includes usernames and passwords, online search activities, birth date, social security, and purchasing history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.techopedia.com/definition/23915/digital-identity|title=What is a Digital Identity? - Definition from Techopedia|access-date=2016-10-01}}</ref>  Especially where that information is publicly available and not anonymized, and can be used by others to discover that person's civil identity. In this wider sense, a digital identity is a version, or facet, of a person's social identity. This may also be referred to as an [[online identity]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Global|first=IndraStra|title=Digital Identity \u2013 A Gateway to All Other Use Cases|url=http://www.indrastra.com/2018/01/Digital-Identity-Gateway-to-All-Other-Use-Cases-004-01-2018-0034.html|journal=IndraStra|issn=2381-3652}}</ref>\n\nThe legal and social effects of digital identity are complex and challenging. However, they are simply a consequence of the increasing use of computers, and the need to provide computers with information that can be used to identify external agents.\n\n==Background==\n\nA critical problem in [[cyberspace]] is knowing with whom one is interacting. Using static identifiers such as password and email there are no ways to precisely determine the identity of a person in digital space, because this information can be stolen or used by many individuals acting as one. Digital identity based on dynamic entity relationships captured from behavioral history across multiple websites and mobile apps can verify and authenticate an identity with up to [https://www.digitalidentityguide.com/what-is-a-digital-identity/ 95 percent accuracy].\n\nBy comparing a set of entity relationships between a new event (e.g., login) and past events, a pattern of [https://www.digitalidentityguide.com/digital-dna/ convergence] can verify or authenticate the identity as legitimate where divergence indicates an attempt to mask an identity. Data used for digital identity is generally [https://www.digitalidentityguide.com/digital-dna/ anonymized] using a one-way hash, thereby avoiding privacy concerns. Because it is based on behavioral history, a digital identity is impossible to fake or steal.\n\n==Related terms==\n\n===Subject and entity===\nA digital identity may also be referred to as a digital subject or digital [[wikt:entity|entity]] and is the digital representation of a set of claims made by one party about itself or another person, group, thing or concept.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.eclipse.org/Digital_Identity|title=Digital Identity - Eclipsepedia|website=wiki.eclipse.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Deh|first=Dragana|last2=Glo\u0111ovi\u0107|first2=Danica|date=2018-09-05|title=The Construction of Identity in Digital Space|journal=AM Journal of Art and Media Studies|language=en|volume=0|issue=16|pages=101|doi=10.25038/am.v0i16.257|issn=2406-1654|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n===Attributes, preferences and traits===\nEvery digital identity has zero or more identity attributes. Attributes are acquired and contain information about a subject, such as medical history, purchasing behaviour, bank balance, age and so on.<ref name=Windley>{{cite book |first=Phillip J. |last=Windley |title=Digital Identity |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |year=2005 |pages=8\u20139 |isbn=978-0596008789}}</ref> Preferences retain a subject's choices such as favourite brand of shoes, preferred currency. Traits are features of the subject that are inherent, such as eye colour, nationality, place of birth. While [[Attribute (computing)|attributes]] of a subject can change easily, traits change slowly, if at all. Digital identity also has entity relationships derived from the devices, environment and locations from which an individual transacts on the web.\n\n=== Rhetoric ===\nThe term \"digital identity\" is used in digital rhetoric field to denote identity as a \"rhetorical construction.\"<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Eyman|first=Douglas|title=Digital Rhetoric: Theory, Method, Practice|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=78}}</ref> Formation of digital identities is one of the main focuses of digital rhetoricians.

The construction of digital identity is also tied to the network. This can be seen from the practices of reputation management companies which work on creating positive identity so that accounts show up higher in various search engines. <ref name=\":2\" />  \n\n==Technical aspects==\n\n===Issuance===\nDigital identities can be issued through [[digital certificates]], which act the same way passports do in the physical world. They contain data which is associated with a user, and are issued with legal guarantees by a recognized [[Certificate authority|certification authority]] (CA).\n\n===Trust, authentication and authorization===\nIn order to assign a digital representation to an entity, the attributing party must trust that the claim of an attribute (such as name, location, role as an employee, or age) is correct and associated with the person or thing presenting the attribute (see [[Digital identity#Authentication|Authentication]] below). Conversely, the individual claiming an attribute may only grant selective access to its information, e.g. (proving identity in a bar or PayPal authentication for payment at a web site). In this way, digital identity is better understood as a particular viewpoint within a mutually-agreed relationship than as an objective property.\n\n====Authentication====\n[[Authentication]] is a key aspect of trust-based identity attribution, providing a codified assurance of the identity of one entity to another. Authentication methodologies include the presentation of a unique object such as a [[bank credit card]], the provision of confidential information such as a [[password]] or the answer to a pre-arranged question, the confirmation of ownership of an e-mail address, and more robust but relatively costly solutions utilizing [[encryption]] methodologies. In general, business-to-business authentication prioritises security while user to business authentication tends towards simplicity. Physical authentication techniques such as [[iris scan]]ning, handprinting, and [[Speaker recognition|voiceprinting]] are currently being developed and in the hope of providing improved protection against [[identity theft]]. Those techniques fall into the area of Biometry ([[biometrics]]). A combination of static identifiers (username & passwords) along with personal unique attributes (biometrics), would allow for [[Multi-factor authentication|multi factor authentication]]. This process would yield more creditable authentication, which in nature is much more difficult to be cracked and manipulated.\n\nWhilst technological progress in authentication continues to evolve, these systems do not prevent aliases from being used. The introduction of [[strong authentication]]{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} for online payment transactions within the [[European Union]] now links a verified person to an account, where such person has been identified in accordance with statutory requirements prior to account being opened. Verifying a person opening an account online typically requires a form of device binding to the credentials being used. This verifies that the device that stands in for a person on the Web is actually the individuals device and not the device of someone simply claiming to be the individual. The concept of [[reliance authentication]] makes use of pre-existing accounts, to piggy back further services upon those accounts, providing that the original source is reliable. The concept of reliability comes from various anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism funding legislation in the USA,<ref>http://www.ffiec.gov/pdf/bsa_aml_examination_manual2006.pdf</ref> EU28,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52013PC0045:EN:NOT|title=EUR-Lex - 52013PC0045 - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu}}</ref> Australia,<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2013C00371 | title=Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006}}</ref> Singapore and New Zealand<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dia.govt.nz/diawebsite.nsf/wpg_URL/Services-Anti-Money-Laundering-AMLCFT-Act-and-Regulations|title=AML/CFT Act and Regulations|first=The Department of Internal|last=Affairs|website=www.dia.govt.nz}}</ref> where second parties may place reliance on the customer due diligence process of the first party, where the first party is say a financial institution. An example of reliance authentication is PayPal's verification method.\n\n====Authorization====\n[[Authorization (computer access control)|Authorization]] is the determination of any entity that controls resources that the authenticated can access those resources.  Authorization depends on authentication, because authorization requires that the critical attribute (i.e., the attribute that determines the authorizer's decision) must be verified.  For example, authorization on a credit card gives access to the resources owned by [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]], e.g., Amazon sends one a product. Authorization of an employee will provide that employee with access to network resources, such as printers, files, or software.   For example, a database management system might be designed so as to provide certain specified individuals with the ability to retrieve information from a database but not the ability to change data stored in the database, while giving other individuals the ability to change data.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nConsider the person who rents a car and checks into a hotel with a credit card. The car rental and hotel company may request authentication that there is credit enough for an accident, or profligate spending on room service.  Thus a card may later be refused when trying to purchase an activity such as a balloon trip. Though there is adequate credit to pay for the rental, the hotel, and the balloon trip, there is an insufficient amount to also cover the authorizations. The actual charges are authorized after leaving the hotel and returning the car, which may be too late for the balloon trip.\n\nValid online authorization requires analysis of information related to the digital event including device and environmental variables. These are generally derived from the [https://www.digitalidentityguide.com/what-is-a-digital-identity/ hundreds of entities] exchanged between a device and business server to support an event using standard Internet protocols.\n\n===Digital identifiers===\nDigital identity fundamentally requires digital identifiers\u2014strings or tokens that are unique within a given scope (globally or locally within a specific domain, community, directory, application, etc.). Identifiers are the key used by the parties to an identification relationship to agree on the entity being represented. Identifiers may be classified as ''omnidirectional'' and ''unidirectional''.<ref>{{cite news |last=Cameron |first=Kim |title=The Laws of Identity |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms996456 |work=msdn.microsoft.com |publisher=Microsoft |date=May 2005}}</ref> Omnidirectional identifiers are intended to be public and easily discoverable, while unidirectional identifiers are intended to be private and used only in the context of a specific identity relationship.\n\nIdentifiers may also be classified as resolvable or non-resolvable. Resolvable identifiers, such as a [[domain name]] or [[e-mail address]], may be dereferenced into the entity they represent, or some current state data providing relevant attributes of that entity.  Non-resolvable identifiers, such as a person's real-world name, or a subject or topic name, can be compared for equivalence but are not otherwise machine-understandable.\n\nThere are many different schemes and formats for digital identifiers. The most widely used is [[Uniform Resource Identifier]] (URI) and its internationalized version [[Internationalized Resource Identifier]] (IRI)\u2014the standard for identifiers on the [[World Wide Web]]. [[OpenID]] and [[Light-Weight Identity]] (LID) are two web authentication protocols that use standard [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] URIs (often called URLs), for example.\n\n===Digital Object Architecture===\nDigital Object Architecture (DOA)<ref>{{cite news |first1=Robert |last1=Kahn |first2=Robert |last2=Wilensky |title=A Framework for Distributed Digital Object Services |url=http://www.cnri.reston.va.us/k-w.html |publisher=Corporation for National Research Initiatives |date=May 13, 1995}}</ref> provides a means of managing digital information in a network environment. A digital object has a machine and platform independent structure that allows it to be identified, accessed and protected, as appropriate. A digital object may incorporate not only informational elements, i.e., a digitized version of a paper, movie or sound recording, but also the unique identifier of the digital object and other metadata about the digital object. The metadata may include restrictions on access to digital objects, notices of ownership, and identifiers for licensing agreements, if appropriate.\n\n===Handle System===\nThe [[Handle System]] is a general purpose distributed information system that provides efficient, extensible, and secure identifier and resolution services for use on networks such as the internet. It includes an open set of protocols, a [[namespace]], and a reference implementation of the protocols. The protocols enable a [[distributed computing|distributed computer system]] to store identifiers, known as handles, of arbitrary resources and resolve those handles into the information necessary to locate, access, contact, authenticate, or otherwise make use of the resources. This information can be changed as needed to reflect the current state of the identified resource without changing its identifier, thus allowing the name of the item to persist over changes of location and other related state information. The original version of the Handle System technology was developed with support from the [[DARPA|Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)]].\n\n===Extensible Resource Identifiers===\nA new [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]] standard for abstract, structured identifiers, [[XRI]] (Extensible Resource Identifiers), adds new features to URIs and IRIs that are especially useful for digital identity systems. [[OpenID]] also supports XRIs, and XRIs are the basis for [[i-name]]s.\n\n===Risk-based authentication===\n\nRisk-based authentication is an application of digital identity whereby multiple entity relationship from the device (e.g., operating system), environment (e.g., DNS Server) and data entered by a user for any given transaction is evaluated for correlation with events from known behaviors for the same identity.<ref>https://www.forrester.com/report/The+Forrester+Wave+RiskBased+Authentication+Q3+2017/-/E-RES121265</ref> Analysis are performed based on quantifiable metrics, such as transaction velocity, locale settings (or attempts to obfuscate), and user-input data (such as ship-to address). Correlation and deviation are mapped to tolerances and scored, then aggregated across multiple entities to compute a transaction risk-score, which assess the risk posed to an organization.\n\n===Policy aspects===\nThere are proponents of treating self-determination and freedom of expression of digital identity as a new [[Human rights|human right]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}  Some have speculated that digital identities could become a new form of [[Juristic person|legal entity]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sullivan|first1=Clare|title=Digital Identity and Mistake|journal=International Journal of Law and Technology|volume=20|issue=3|pages=223\u2013241|date=2012|doi=10.1093/ijlit/eas015}}</ref>\n\n===Taxonomies of identity===\nDigital identity attributes\u2014or data\u2014exist within the context of [[Ontology (computer science)|ontologies]].\n\nThe development of digital identity network solutions that can interoperate taxonomically-diverse representations of digital identity is a contemporary challenge. [[Folksonomy|Free-tagging]] has emerged recently as an effective way of circumventing this challenge (to date, primarily with application to the identity of digital entities such as bookmarks and photos) by effectively flattening identity attributes into a single, unstructured layer. However, the organic integration of the benefits of both structured and fluid approaches to identity attribute management remains elusive.\n\n===Networked identity===\nIdentity relationships within a digital network may include multiple identity entities. However, in a decentralised network like the Internet, such extended identity relationships effectively require both (a) the existence of independent trust relationships between each pair of entities in the relationship and (b) a means of reliably integrating the paired relationships into larger relational units. And if identity relationships are to reach beyond the context of a single, federated ontology of identity (see [[#Taxonomies of identity|Taxonomies of identity]] above), identity attributes must somehow be matched across diverse ontologies. The development of network  approaches that can embody such integrated \"compound\" trust relationships is currently a topic of much debate in the [[blogosphere]].\n\nIntegrated compound trust relationships allow, for example, entity A to accept an assertion or claim about entity B by entity C. C thus vouches for an aspect of B's identity to A.\n\nA key feature of \"compound\" trust relationships is the possibility of selective disclosure from one entity to another of locally relevant information. As an illustration of the potential application of selective disclosure, let us suppose a certain Diana wished to book a hire car without disclosing irrelevant personal information (utilising a notional digital identity network that supports compound trust relationships). As an adult, UK resident with a current driving license, Diana might have the UK's [[Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency]] vouch for her driving qualification, age and nationality to a car-rental company without having her name or contact details disclosed. Similarly, Diana's bank might assert just her banking details to the rental company.  Selective disclosure allows for appropriate [[privacy]] of information within a network of identity relationships.\n\nA classic form of networked digital identity based on international standards is the \"White Pages\".\n\nAn electronic white pages links various devices, like computers and telephones, to an individual or organization. Various attributes such as X.509v3 digital certificates for secure cryptographic communications are captured under a schema, and published in an [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol|LDAP]] or [[X.500]] directory. Changes to the LDAP standard are managed by working groups in the [[IETF]], and changes in X.500 are managed by the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]. The ITU did significant analysis of gaps in digital identity interoperability via the FGidm, focus group on [[identity management]].\n\nImplementations of X.500[2005] and LDAPv3 have occurred worldwide but are primarily located in major data centers with administrative policy boundaries regarding sharing of personal information. Since combined X.500 [2005] and LDAPv3 directories can hold millions of unique objects for rapid access, it is expected to play a continued role for large scale secure identity access services. LDAPv3 can act as a lightweight standalone server, or in the original design as a TCP-IP based Lightweight Directory Access Protocol compatible with making queries to a X.500 mesh of servers which can run the native OSI protocol.\n\nThis will be done by scaling individual servers into larger groupings that represent defined \"administrative domains\", (such as the country level digital object) which can add value not present in the original \"White Pages\" that was used to look up phone numbers and email addresses, largely now available through non-authoritative search engines.\n\nThe ability to leverage and extend a networked digital identity is made more practicable by the expression of the level of trust associated with the given identity through a common [[Identity Assurance Framework]].\n\n===Blockchain-based digital identity===\nSeveral attempts have been made to create digital identity systems based on append-only databases, such as [[blockchain]]s. These solutions often market themselves toward users who enjoy peer-to-peer applications or who may have concerns about identity systems managed by central parties.\n\nIn 2018, [[Edinburgh Napier University]] partnered with [[Blockpass]], a blockchain-based self-sovereign [[Digital identity certificate|identity protocol]], to open a research lab at the University<ref>https://www.napier.ac.uk/about-us/our-schools/school-of-computing/student-stories/blockchain</ref>. The lab focuses on how blockchain technology and [[cryptography]] can protect personal data and digital identities from modern threats such as online [[hackers]] and malicious actors.\n\n==Security issues and privacy==\nSeveral writers have pointed out the tension between ubiquitous services that consume digital identity on the one hand and privacy on the other.<ref name=Camp>{{cite news |first=L.

[[General Data Protection Regulation|GDPR]] is one attempt to address this concern using regulation.\n\nMany systems provide privacy-related mitigations when analyzing data linked to digital identities. One common mitigation is [[data anonymization]], such as hashing user identifiers with a [[cryptographic hash function]]. Another popular technique is adding statistical noise to a data set to reduce identifiability, such as with [[differential privacy]].\n\nWhile a digital identity allows consumers to transact from anywhere and more easily manage various ID cards, it also poses a potential single point of compromise that malicious hackers can use to steal all of that personal information.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cutimes.com/2019/11/22/digital-identities-abound-few-understand-how-they-work/|title=Digital Identities Abound & Few Understand How They Work|last=November 22|first=Tina Orem {{!}}|last2=PM|first2=2019 at 12:31|website=Credit Union Times|language=en|access-date=2020-02-24}}</ref>\n\n==Legal issues==\nClare Sullivan presents the grounds for digital identity as an emerging legal concept.<ref name=Sullivan>{{cite book |first=Clare |last=Sullivan |url=http://www.adelaide.edu.au/press/titles/digital-identity/ |title=Digital Identity |publisher=The University of Adelaide |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-9807230-0-7|doi=10.1017/UPO9780980723007 }}</ref> The UK's [[Identity Cards Act 2006]] confirms Sullivan's argument and unfolds the new legal concept involving database identity and transaction identity. Database identity refers to the collection of data that is registered about an individual within the databases of the scheme and transaction identity is a set of information that defines the individual's identity for transactional purposes. Although there is reliance on the verification of identity, none of the processes used are entirely trustworthy. The consequences of digital identity abuse and fraud are potentially serious, since in possible implications the person is held legally responsible.<ref name=Sullivan/>\n\n==Business aspects==\nCorporations have begun to recognize the Internet's potential to facilitate the tailoring of the online storefront to each individual customer. Purchase suggestions, [[personalized advertisement|personalised adverts]] and other tailored marketing strategies are a great success to businesses. Such tailoring however, depends on the ability to connect attributes and preferences to the identity of the visitor.<ref>{{cite news |first1=Hal |last1=Ableson |first2=Lawrence |last2=Lessig |title=Digital Identity in Cyberspace |date=10 September 1998 |url=http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/student-papers/fall98-papers/identity/linked-white-paper.html |work=MIT.edu}}</ref>\n\n==Variance by jurisdiction==\nWhile many facets of digital identity are universal owing in part to the ubiquity of the Internet, some regional variations exist due to specific laws, practices and government services that are in place.  For example, [[Digital identity in Australia]] can utilize services that validate [[Driving licences]], [[Passports]] and other physical documents online to help improve the quality of a digital identity, also strict [[Money laundering#Australia|Anti-money laundering]] policies mean that some services, such as money transfers need a stricter level of validation of digital identity.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Digital footprint]]\n* [[E-authentication]]\n* [[Federated identity]]\n* [[Informational self-determination]]\n* [[Privacy by design]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Digital Identity}}\n[[Category:Identity management]]\n[[Category:Digital technology]]\n[[Category:Federated identity]]\n[[Category:Computer access control]]\n", "name_user": "Morozok7", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eRhetoric", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_identity"}

{"title_page": "Transactive memory", "text_new": "{{Psychology sidebar}}\n<!--{{pp-move-indef}}-->\n\n'''Transactive memory''' is a psychological hypothesis first proposed by [[Daniel Wegner]] in 1985 as a response to earlier theories of \"[[Collective intelligence|group mind]]\" such as [[groupthink]].<ref name=\"wegner85\">Wegner, D. M., Giuliano, T., & Hertel, P. (1985). Cognitive interdependence in close relationships. In W. J. Ickes (Ed.), Compatible and incompatible relationships (pp. 253-276). New York: Springer-Verlag.</ref> A transactive memory system is a mechanism through which groups collectively encode, store, and retrieve knowledge. Transactive memory was initially studied in [[wikt:couple|couples]] and [[families]] where individuals had close relationships but was later extended to teams, larger groups, and organizations to explain how they develop a \"group mind\",<ref name=\"wegner85\"/> a memory system that is more complex and potentially more effective than that of any of its individual constituents. A transactive memory system includes memory stored in each individual, the interactions between memory within the individuals, as well as the processes that update this memory. Transactive memory, then, is the shared store of knowledge.\n\nAccording to Wegner, a transactive memory system consists of the knowledge stored in each individual's memory combined with [[metamemory]] containing [[information]] regarding the different teammate's domains of expertise.<ref name=\"wegner95\">{{cite journal | last1 = Wegner | first1 = D. M. | year = 1995 | title = A computer network model of human transactive memory | url = | journal = Social Cognition | volume = 13 | issue = 3| pages = 319\u2013339 | doi = 10.1521/soco.1995.13.3.319 }}</ref> The transactive memory system works similarly to [[External memory (psychology)|external memory]], where other members of the group are the external memory aid. Just as an individual's metamemory allows them to be aware of what information is available for [[Information retrieval|retrieval]], so does the transactive memory system provide teammates with information regarding the [[knowledge]] they have access to within the group.<ref name=\"wegner86\">Wegner, D. M. (1986). Transactive memory: A contemporary analysis of the group mind. In B.Mullen & G. R. Goethals (Eds.), Theories of group behavior (pp. 185\u2013205). New York: Springer-Verlag</ref> Group members learn who knowledge experts are and how to access expertise through communicative processes. In this way, a transactive memory system can provide the group members with more and better knowledge than any individual could access on their own.\n\n==History==\nTransactive memory was first envisioned by Daniel Wegner in 1985.<ref name=\"wegner85\"/> This concept proposed that when two individuals spend a lot of time around each other and work together, they create a shared store of knowledge between the members. In essence, one member of the couple could store information within their partner and then recall that information by asking their partner about it. This concept was different and unique from other descriptions of [[socially distributed cognition]] in that it describes a situation where individuals hold different knowledge compared to shared information, and members of the group engage in transactions to assist in recall of the stored information.<ref name = \"Lewis11\">{{cite journal|last1=Lewis|first1=Kyle|last2=Herndon|first2=B.|title=Transactive memory systems: Current issues and future research directions|journal=Organization Science|year=2011|volume=22|issue=5|pages=1254\u20131265|doi=10.1287/orsc.1110.0647}}</ref>  In a recent review, Ren and [[Linda Argote|Argote]] described transactive memory as existing of both a structural component (the linkages of individual memory to the collective) and transactive processes that make the transactive memory dynamic.<ref name=\"Ren11\">{{cite journal|last1=Ren|first1=Yuquing|last2=Argote|first2=L.|author2-link= Linda Argote |title=Transactive Memory Systems 1985\u20132010: An Integrative Framework of Key Dimensions, Antecedents, and Consequences|journal=The Academy of Management Annals|year=2011|volume=5|issue=1|pages = 189\u2013229|doi=10.1080/19416520.2011.590300}}</ref> Wegner first proposed these three processes which occur in groups that lead to the formation and reification of transactive memory: encoding, storage, and retrieval described more below. In a series of experiments, Hollingshead found that romantic partners (who are assumed to have transactive memory) performed better on knowledge recall than dyads<ref name=\"Hollinghshead98B\">{{cite journal | last1 = Hollingshead | first1 = A.B. | year = 1998b | title = Retrieval processes in transactive memory systems | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 74 | issue = 3| pages = 659\u2013671 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.74.3.659 }}</ref> and that couples will memorize more words in a list than two strangers when they are rewarded on number of unique words you recall.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hollingshead|first=A.|title=Cognitive interdependence and convergent expectations in transactive memory|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2001|volume=81|pages=1080\u20131089|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.81.6.1080|pmid=11761309|issue=6}}</ref> The explanation for these findings are that couples know how best to remind each other of the knowledge they have, and that couples have a good conception of the other's knowledge and will therefore avoid memorizing words within their partner's domain. Strangers don't have access to this same shared information which leads to poorer performance in these kinds of tasks. Transactive memory was further extended by Diane Liang and colleagues into the realm of work groups.<ref name = \"Liang95\"/> In this work, the development of transactive memory was conceived of as a way to improve group's performance when engaging in interdependent tasks. After this extension, transactive memory became more prolific in [[organizational behavior]] among other disciplines.<ref name = \"Ren11\"/>\n\n==Transactive processes==\nJust like human memory, the development of a transactive memory system involves three stages: encoding, storage and retrieval. These processes are transactive, meaning that they are updated as members exchange information with one another.<ref name=\"wegner86\"/>\n\n===Encoding===\n\nIn the ''[[encoding]]'' stage, the teammates gain information on the other team members domains of knowledge and [[Categorization|categorize]] it by ascribing each knowledge domain to the corresponding team member.<ref name=\"Rulke00\">{{cite journal| last1=Rulke|first1= D. |last2=Rau |first2= D. |year=2000 |title=Investigating the Encoding Process of Transactive Memory Development in Group Training | journal= Group & Organization Management|volume=25|pages= 373\u2013396| doi=10.1177/1059601100254004| issue=4 }}</ref> Sometimes, this acquaintance can emerge through \"who did what\" or \"who knows what\" conversation, or even through direct instruction such as by telling a teammate to remember certain information. There may also be discussion and negotiation of where and in what form to store information in the group.<ref name=\"wegner86\"/>\n\nThe encoding process is very important in the development of transactive memory.<ref name=\"Rulke00\"/> Encoding occurs through interaction between teammates: through sharing knowledge and seeking information from other team members, teammates learn the expertise of each team member as a first essential step towards specialization. These experts then are responsible for continuing to encode new and relevant information in their domains of knowledge.<ref name=\"wegner86\"/> \n\n===Storage===\nIn the ''[[Storage (memory)|storage]]'' stage, the relevant information is stored in the possession of the team member, or members, with the corresponding expertise; once the experts have been identified, new information is transmitted directly to the those team members. This improves the [[learning]] process and reduces the [[Cognitive load|load]] on the memory of individual teammates.<ref name=\"wegner95\"/> With transactive memory storage, a team member only has to remember the information in their domain of expertise, while they only have to remember the what the other members' domains of expertise are rather than storing all the information in the transactive memory.<ref name=\"wegner86\" />\n\nInformation may be also lost or modified during storage for transitive memory, as is in the case of individual memory. These modifications, however, may be even more rapid and impactful than in individual memory because the information is scattered and stored with multiple members in the group, making the information more readily replaced with misinformation.<ref name=\"wegner86\" />\n\n===Retrieval===\nDuring the ''[[Information retrieval|retrieval]]'' stage, a group member uses the developed transactive memory to identify a group member that specializes in the required knowledge area and then turns to that member to attain the knowledge. If the inquiring member has not encoded in their individual metamemory who specializes in the knowledge, retrieval can be initiated by asking other members in the storage system for who the expert who specializes in the information they want to retrieve is, then connecting with that expert after a series of consultations.<ref name=\"wegner86\"/> If this information is accurate and useful, the linkage to the member with specialized knowledge is strengthened. If the information is not accurate, then the encoding stage is entered into again such that information about the inaccuracy of the knowledge the specialized member provided is re-encoded and stored in the transactive memory system.\n\n==Development==\nMuch research has shown that a transactive memory system is primarily developed through interactions between team members. Training on the task that a group is expected to do together has been shown to assist in the development of a transactive memory system.<ref name=\"Liang95\">{{cite journal | last1 = Liang | first1 = D. W. | last2 = Moreland | first2 = R.

The researchers concluded that the interactions that took place during the joint training allowed the team members to develop an understanding of their teammates' skills, assisted their search for relevant information about the task from their teammates, and assess the accuracy and reliability of this information.

This differentiation of knowledge is where the real benefit of a transactive memory system is enacted because, with less overlap in member's areas of expertise, distribution of labor becomes easier and the group can become more efficient (Wegner 1987). When each team member can deepen his knowledge in any areas that are lacking (as opposed to acquiring congruent knowledge) they will enlarge the teams' total collective knowledge.<ref name=\"Lewis03\"/> Hollingshead (1998a) demonstrated that specialization lead to a more efficient and organized effort investment in information retrieval, prevention of information redundancy and supplied accessibility to  larger range of expertise.<ref name=\"HollingsheadA\">Hollingshead, A.

Lewis and Herndon (2011) suggested criteria for kinds of tasks that a developed transactive memory system will be the most helpful in improving the performance of.\n* Tasks that require diverse knowledge.\n* Tasks that require a deep understanding of specialized knowledge.\n* Tasks where the credibility and accuracy of information is important.\n* Tasks where it is possible to know which members possess expertise.\n* Tasks that require a complete application of knowledge to the task.\n* Tasks where efficient coordination between members is important.\nFor these reasons, groups performing tasks that can't be broken apart or require little specialization may not get much benefit out of the development of a transactive memory system. The authors suggest that tasks where ideas have to be executed and all members have the same goal will benefit the most from a transactive memory system. Conversely the authors suggest that groups that engage in brainstorming or decision tasks may develop transactive memory systems faster than those merely executing ideas because there is more knowledge sharing and interaction between members.\n\n==Extensions to other domains==\nWhen transactive memory was first envisioned, the authors were describing an external memory store within other people. They did acknowledge that we often store information within objects such as notebooks, books, or other recordings. These objects are static and transactive processes cannot occur. These objects, therefore, cannot cue memories within individuals in the same way another person could. The Internet, however, is much more dynamic than a book and individuals can engage in similar transactive processes as they would with other individuals. Research published in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' on 14 July 2011 suggests that when people expect to have future access to information, they have lower rates of recall of the information, but higher rates of recall of the sources of the information.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sparrow|first=Betsy|author2=Liu, Jenny |author3=Wegner, Daniel M. |title=Google Effects on Memory: Cognitive Consequences of Having Information at Our Fingertips|journal=Science|date=14 June 2011|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2011/07/13/science.1207745|accessdate=18 July 2011|doi=10.1126/science.1207745|volume=333|issue=6043|pages=776\u20138|pmid=21764755 }}</ref> The authors suggest that this research demonstrates that individuals are developing a transactive memory system with the Internet, relying on it for information instead of internalizing it within their own memories.

New York: Springer-Verlag.</ref> A transactive memory system is a mechanism through which groups collectively encode, store, and retrieve knowledge. Transactive memory was initially studied in [[wikt:couple|couples]] and [[families]] where individuals had close relationships but was later extended to teams, larger groups, and organizations to explain how they develop a \"group mind\",<ref name=\"wegner85\"/> a memory system that is more complex and potentially more effective than that of any of its individual constituents. A transactive memory system includes memory stored in each individual, the interactions between memory within the individuals, as well as the processes that update this memory. Transactive memory, then, is the shared store of knowledge.\n\nAccording to Wegner, a transactive memory system consists of the knowledge stored in each individual's memory combined with [[metamemory]] containing [[information]] regarding the different teammate's domains of expertise.<ref name=\"wegner95\">{{cite journal | last1 = Wegner | first1 = D.

Just as an individual's metamemory allows them to be aware of what information is available for [[Information retrieval|retrieval]], so does the transactive memory system provide teammates with information regarding the [[knowledge]] they have access to within the group.<ref name=\"wegner86\">Wegner, D. M. (1986). Transactive memory: A contemporary analysis of the group mind. In B.Mullen & G. R. Goethals (Eds.), Theories of group behavior (pp. 185\u2013205). New York: Springer-Verlag</ref> Group members learn who knowledge experts are and how to access expertise through communicative processes. In this way, a transactive memory system can provide the group members with more and better knowledge than any individual could access on their own.\n\n==History==\nTransactive memory was first envisioned by Daniel Wegner in 1985.<ref name=\"wegner85\"/> This concept proposed that when two individuals spend a lot of time around each other and work together, they create a shared store of knowledge between the members. In essence, one member of the couple could store information within their partner and then recall that information by asking their partner about it. This concept was different and unique from other descriptions of [[socially distributed cognition]] in that it describes a situation where individuals hold different knowledge compared to shared information, and members of the group engage in transactions to assist in recall of the stored information.<ref name = \"Lewis11\">{{cite journal|last1=Lewis|first1=Kyle|last2=Herndon|first2=B.|title=Transactive memory systems: Current issues and future research directions|journal=Organization Science|year=2011|volume=22|issue=5|pages=1254\u20131265|doi=10.1287/orsc.1110.0647}}</ref>  In a recent review, Ren and [[Linda Argote|Argote]] described transactive memory as existing of both a structural component (the linkages of individual memory to the collective) and transactive processes that make the transactive memory dynamic.<ref name=\"Ren11\">{{cite journal|last1=Ren|first1=Yuquing|last2=Argote|first2=L.|author2-link= Linda Argote |title=Transactive Memory Systems 1985\u20132010: An Integrative Framework of Key Dimensions, Antecedents, and Consequences|journal=The Academy of Management Annals|year=2011|volume=5|issue=1|pages = 189\u2013229|doi=10.1080/19416520.2011.590300}}</ref> Wegner first proposed these three processes which occur in groups that lead to the formation and reification of transactive memory: encoding, storage, and retrieval described more below.

Strangers don't have access to this same shared information which leads to poorer performance in these kinds of tasks. Transactive memory was further extended by Diane Liang and colleagues into the realm of work groups.<ref name = \"Liang95\"/> In this work, the development of transactive memory was conceived of as a way to improve group's performance when engaging in interdependent tasks. After this extension, transactive memory became more prolific in [[organizational behavior]] among other disciplines.<ref name = \"Ren11\"/>\n\n==Transactive processes==\nJust like human memory, the development of a transactive memory system involves three stages: encoding, storage and retrieval. These processes are transactive, meaning that they are updated as members exchange information with one another.<ref name=\"wegner86\"/>\n\n===Encoding===\n\nIn the ''[[encoding]]'' stage, the teammates gain information on the other team members domains of knowledge and [[Categorization|categorize]] it by ascribing each knowledge domain to the corresponding team member.<ref name=\"Rulke00\">{{cite journal| last1=Rulke|first1= D. |last2=Rau |first2= D. |year=2000 |title=Investigating the Encoding Process of Transactive Memory Development in Group Training | journal= Group & Organization Management|volume=25|pages= 373\u2013396| doi=10.1177/1059601100254004| issue=4 }}</ref> Sometimes, this acquaintance can emerge through \"who did what\" or \"who knows what\" conversation, or even through direct instruction such as by telling a teammate to remember certain information. There may also be discussion and negotiation of where and in what form to store information in the group.<ref name=\"wegner86\"/>\n\nThe encoding process is very important in the development of transactive memory.<ref name=\"Rulke00\"/> Encoding occurs through interaction between teammates: through sharing knowledge and seeking information from other team members, teammates learn the expertise of each team member as a first essential step towards specialization. These experts then are responsible for continuing to encode new and relevant information in their domains of knowledge.<ref name=\"wegner86\"/> \n\n===Storage===\nIn the ''[[Storage (memory)|storage]]'' stage, the relevant information is stored in the possession of the team member, or members, with the corresponding expertise; once the experts have been identified, new information is transmitted directly to the those team members. This improves the [[learning]] process and reduces the [[Cognitive load|load]] on the memory of individual teammates.<ref name=\"wegner95\"/> With transactive memory storage, a team member only has to remember the information in their domain of expertise, while they only have to remember the metamemory of other members' domains of expertise rather than storing all the information in the transactive memory.<ref name=\"wegner86\" />\n\nInformation may be also lost or modified during storage for transitive memory, as is in the case of individual memory. These modifications, however, may be even more rapid and impactful than in individual memory because the information is scattered and stored with multiple members in the group, making the information more readily replaced with misinformation.<ref name=\"wegner86\" />\n\n===Retrieval===\nDuring the ''[[Information retrieval|retrieval]]'' stage, a group member uses the developed transactive memory to identify a group member that specializes in the required knowledge area and then turns to that member to attain the knowledge. If the inquiring member has not encoded in their individual metamemory who specializes in the knowledge, retrieval can be initiated by asking other members in the storage system for who the expert who specializes in the information they want to retrieve is, then connecting with that expert after a series of consultations.<ref name=\"wegner86\"/> If this information is accurate and useful, the linkage to the member with specialized knowledge is strengthened. If the information is not accurate, then the encoding stage is entered into again such that information about the inaccuracy of the knowledge the specialized member provided is re-encoded and stored in the transactive memory system.\n\n==Development==\nMuch research has shown that a transactive memory system is primarily developed through interactions between team members. Training on the task that a group is expected to do together has been shown to assist in the development of a transactive memory system.<ref name=\"Liang95\">{{cite journal | last1 = Liang | first1 = D.

As a result, groups that trained together performed better in the task.

This differentiation of knowledge is where the real benefit of a transactive memory system is enacted because, with less overlap in member's areas of expertise, distribution of labor becomes easier and the group can become more efficient (Wegner 1987). When each team member can deepen his knowledge in any areas that are lacking (as opposed to acquiring congruent knowledge) they will enlarge the teams' total collective knowledge.<ref name=\"Lewis03\"/> Hollingshead (1998a) demonstrated that specialization lead to a more efficient and organized effort investment in information retrieval, prevention of information redundancy and supplied accessibility to  larger range of expertise.<ref name=\"HollingsheadA\">Hollingshead, A.

Lewis and Herndon (2011) suggested criteria for kinds of tasks that a developed transactive memory system will be the most helpful in improving the performance of.\n* Tasks that require diverse knowledge.\n* Tasks that require a deep understanding of specialized knowledge.\n* Tasks where the credibility and accuracy of information is important.\n* Tasks where it is possible to know which members possess expertise.\n* Tasks that require a complete application of knowledge to the task.\n* Tasks where efficient coordination between members is important.\nFor these reasons, groups performing tasks that can't be broken apart or require little specialization may not get much benefit out of the development of a transactive memory system. The authors suggest that tasks where ideas have to be executed and all members have the same goal will benefit the most from a transactive memory system. Conversely the authors suggest that groups that engage in brainstorming or decision tasks may develop transactive memory systems faster than those merely executing ideas because there is more knowledge sharing and interaction between members.\n\n==Extensions to other domains==\nWhen transactive memory was first envisioned, the authors were describing an external memory store within other people. They did acknowledge that we often store information within objects such as notebooks, books, or other recordings. These objects are static and transactive processes cannot occur. These objects, therefore, cannot cue memories within individuals in the same way another person could. The Internet, however, is much more dynamic than a book and individuals can engage in similar transactive processes as they would with other individuals. Research published in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' on 14 July 2011 suggests that when people expect to have future access to information, they have lower rates of recall of the information, but higher rates of recall of the sources of the information.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sparrow|first=Betsy|author2=Liu, Jenny |author3=Wegner, Daniel M. |title=Google Effects on Memory: Cognitive Consequences of Having Information at Our Fingertips|journal=Science|date=14 June 2011|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2011/07/13/science.1207745|accessdate=18 July 2011|doi=10.1126/science.1207745|volume=333|issue=6043|pages=776\u20138|pmid=21764755 }}</ref> The authors suggest that this research demonstrates that individuals are developing a transactive memory system with the Internet, relying on it for information instead of internalizing it within their own memories.

It was released on April 17, 2020, Apple's first release since ''[[The Idler Wheel...]]'' in 2012.\n\nApple began recording the album in 2015, producing and performing it alongside Amy Aileen Wood, [[Sebastian Steinberg]] and [[Dav\u00edd Garza]]. It features a percussive and idiosyncratic sound, lyrically exploring freedom from oppression and Apple's relationships with women.\n\nThe album was released during the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic]], and many critics found its exploration of confinement pertinent. It received universal critical acclaim, and is currently the highest-rated album of all time on review aggregator [[Metacritic]].\n\n==Background and recording==\nIn 2012, Apple began conceptualizing a new album, considering a [[concept album]] based on her home in [[Venice Beach]] or the [[Pando (tree)|Pando]] in Utah.\n\nIn February 2015, she began rehearsals for the album with band members [[Sebastian Steinberg]], Amy Aileen Wood and [[Dav\u00edd Garza]].<ref name=\"VultureProfile\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/04/fiona-apple-fetch-the-bolt-cutters.html|title=Allow Fiona Apple to Reintroduce Herself|last=Handler|first=Rachel|date=April 17, 2020|website=[[New York (magazine)|Vulture]]|access-date=April 18, 2020}}</ref> They began writing and rehearsing in Apple's [[Venice Beach]] home studio, using home-made percussive objects and chanting as they marched around the house.<ref name=\"newyorker\">{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/23/fiona-apples-art-of-radical-sensitivity|title=Fiona Apple's Art of Radical Sensitivity|last=Nussbaum|first=Emily|author-link=Emily Nussbaum|website=[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]|date=March 16, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn July, they began recording the album, spending three weeks at the [[Sonic Ranch]] studio in rural Texas, with little success. A few months later, after returning to Venice Beach, they began making progress, with Apple recording long takes consisting of instruments being hit against surfaces and objects. Apple's vocals were unedited, and the album developed a highly percussive sound.<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/><ref name=\"newyorker\"/> As well as Apple's home, recording sessions took place at Stanley Recordings and at engineer [[Dave Way]]'s private studio, Waystation.<ref name=\"Credits\"/>\n\nBy July 2019, Apple had begun mixing the album.

It was released on April 17, 2020, Apple's first release since ''[[The Idler Wheel...]]'' in 2012.\n\nApple began recording the album in 2015, producing and performing it alongside Amy Aileen Wood, [[Sebastian Steinberg]] and [[Dav\u00edd Garza]]. It features a percussive and idiosyncratic sound, lyrically exploring freedom from oppression and Apple's relationships with women.\n\nThe album was released during the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic]], and many critics found its exploration of confinement pertinent. It received universal critical acclaim, and is currently the highest-rated album of all time on review aggregator [[Metacritic]].\n\n==Background and recording==\nIn 2012, Apple began conceptualizing a new album, considering a [[concept album]] based on her home in [[Venice Beach]] or the [[Pando (tree)|Pando]] in Utah.\n\nIn February 2015, she began rehearsals for the album with band members [[Sebastian Steinberg]], Amy Aileen Wood and [[Dav\u00edd Garza]].<ref name=\"VultureProfile\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/04/fiona-apple-fetch-the-bolt-cutters.html|title=Allow Fiona Apple to Reintroduce Herself|last=Handler|first=Rachel|date=April 17, 2020|website=[[New York (magazine)|Vulture]]|access-date=April 18, 2020}}</ref> They began writing and rehearsing in Apple's [[Venice Beach]] home studio, using home-made percussive objects and chanting as they marched around the house.<ref name=\"newyorker\">{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/23/fiona-apples-art-of-radical-sensitivity|title=Fiona Apple's Art of Radical Sensitivity|last=Nussbaum|first=Emily|author-link=Emily Nussbaum|website=[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]|date=March 16, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn July, they began recording the album, spending three weeks at the [[Sonic Ranch]] studio in rural Texas, with little success. A few months later, after returning to Venice Beach, they began making progress, with Apple recording long takes consisting of instruments being hit against surfaces and objects. Apple's vocals were unedited, and the album developed a highly percussive sound.<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/><ref name=\"newyorker\"/> As well as Apple's home, recording sessions took place at Stanley Recordings and at engineer [[Dave Way]]'s private studio, Waystation.<ref name=\"Credits\"/>\n\nBy July 2019, Apple had begun mixing the album. In September, the process began to slow down, with Apple developing doubts about the album.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> At this time, the artist first mentioned work on her new project in an interview with ''[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]'', explaining that she was still working hard on her next album which should have been released \"a million years ago\" and was hoping to put it out in 2020. She also admitted to being reclusive due to ongoing recording sessions at her Venice Beach house.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/fiona-apple-is-still-calling-bullshit.html|title=Fiona Apple Is Still Calling Bullshit|last=Handler|first=Rachel|website=[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]|date=September 25, 2019|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2020, she played the mixes to her band members, whose positive response brought Apple back on track.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> In an interview that month, she said that the album process was in its final stages, with the only things left being \"artwork and stuff\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2020/01/fiona-apple-new-album-soon/|title=Fiona Apple says new album will \"be done soon\"|last=Bacior|first=Robin|website=Consequence of Sound|date=January 22, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/01/fiona-apple-new-album-updates.html|title=15 Minutes With Fiona Apple|last=Handler|first=Rachel|website=Vulture|date=January 22, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref> On March 9, 2020, she revealed that she had finished recording.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/fiona-apple-reveals-her-new-album-is-finished-2622233|title=Fiona Apple reveals her new album is finished|last=Langford|first=Jackson|website=[[NME]]|date=March 9, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Composition==\n===Musical style===\nThe album's sound is defined by percussion.

Apple's dog Mercy appears on the album, as well as [[Cara Delevigne]]'s Leo and Alfie, and Zelda Hallman's Maddie.<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/>\n\nOn the album, Apple approached her voice as a musical instrument, commenting: \"I have fun with my voice, but I\u2019m not trying to make it pretty all the time. I\u2019m not trying to convince anybody I\u2019m a singer. It just turned out to be another instrument\".<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/> Breihan noted that Apple demonstrates \"a [[rapper]]\u2019s sense that words can be music\",<ref name=\"Stereogum\"/> while ''[[The Guardian]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Laura Barton]] highlighted the intimacy of Apple's vocals: \"half-conversational, half-self-mutters, allowing every scuff, breath and feral yelp\".<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> [[Jon Pareles]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' found that \"whether she\u2019s cooing with sarcastic solicitousness or rasping close to a scream, she articulates every word clearly, emoting but never losing control\".<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/>\n\nThe album defies genre categorisation, and critics have noted its originality.<ref name=\"Stereogum\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-homemade-insight-of-fetch-the-bolt-cutters|title=The Homemade Insight of Fiona Apple\u2019s \"Fetch the Bolt Cutters\"|last=Battan|first=Carrie|date=April 18, 2020|website=[[The New Yorker]]|access-date=April 21, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Pitchfork\"/> Nevertheless, it has been compared to the works of [[Joni Mitchell]],<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/><ref name=\"Observer\"/> [[Tom Waits]],<ref name=\"The Times\"/><ref name=\"NYTReview\"/><ref name=\"Observer\"/> [[Nina Simone]],<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/><ref name=\"LA Times\"/> and [[Kate Bush]],<ref name=\"The Times\"/><ref name=\"NYTReview\"/> who is quoted on the title track.<ref name=\"Observer\"/>\n\n===Lyrics and themes===\nLyrically, Apple identified the album's main theme as \"not being afraid to speak,\"<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> with Barton similarly recognising \"a refusal to be silenced\".<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> Apple later said that this was an oversimplification, elaborating that \"it's about breaking out of whatever prison you\u2019ve allowed yourself to live in,\" and pinpointing the message as: \"Fetch the fucking bolt cutters and get yourself out of the situation you\u2019re in\".<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/> Pareles found that the album explored \"both past and present injuries: bullying, sexual assault, destructive mind games, romantic debacles, [Apple's] own fears and compulsions and the people who have taken advantage of them\".<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/> The album explores freedom,<ref name=\"Observer\"/> with Breihan writing that \"we can hear the euphoria of a great unburdening\".<ref name=\"Stereogum\"/> The album has also been identified as Apple's most humorous album.<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/>\n\nAnother theme Apple explores on the album are her complex social relationships with other women.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> Apple commented that these relationships began to suffer in middle school,<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/> and the album features Apple trying to make peace with \"the sorts of women that society has always deemed her 'competition'\", such as subsequent girlfriends of her exes.<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/> Apple summarised this idea as \"not letting men pit us against each other or keep us separate from each other so they can control the message\".<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/>\n\n==Release==\nOn March 16, 2020, Apple announced the album and its title in an extensive ''[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]'' profile.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> At the start of April, she announced that the album was set to be released digitally on April 17.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/fiona-apple-releasing-new-album-fetch-the-bolt-cutters-this-month/|title=Fiona Apple Releasing New Album ''Fetch the Bolt Cutters'' This Month|last=Minsker|first=Evan|date=April 1, 2020|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|access-date=April 1, 2020}}</ref> [[Epic Records]] had planned to release the album in October, due to promotional limitations brought by the [[impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on the arts and cultural heritage|coronavirus pandemic]].

He built the four-story city house on the west side of Broadway in 1786\u201388. Macomb leased it to the French [[Envoy (title)|Minister Plenipotentiary]], the [[El\u00e9nor-Fran\u00e7ois-Elie, Comte de Moustier|Comte de Moustier]], who occupied it until his return to [[Paris]] in early 1790.

He had been living there a week before his April 30, 1789, inauguration as the first [[President of the United States]]. The Osgood House (demolished 1856) was in the most congested part of Manhattan, near the port along the [[East River]], and Washington found it cramped for his presidential household.
