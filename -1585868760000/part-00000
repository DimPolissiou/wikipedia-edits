Djerv 1919 won the qualification and was promoted to the 1. divisjon.\n\n===New rules===\nFor the first time in [[Norwegian football]], three rather than two points were given for wins. There was also another, more controversial new rule for points: if a match was drawn, two points would be given to the winner of a [[penalty shootout (football)|penalty shootout]], and one point to the loser of the shootout. This rule, suggested by [[Tom A. Schanke]] and appointed by the [[Norwegian Football Association]] in February 1987, was highly controversial and liquidated after the 1987 season.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nrk.no/sport/fotball/1.8017586 |title=Aldri har det v\u00e6rt mer nettsus i Norge |last=Lote |first=Arve |language=Norwegian |work=[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=2 March 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65shtlW2P?url=http://www.nrk.no/sport/fotball/1.8017586 |archivedate=3 March 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Tables==\n===Group A===\n<onlyinclude>{{#invoke:sports table|main|style=WL PK\n|section=Group A\n|res_col_header=PQR\n\n|team1=SOG|name_SOG=[[Sogndal Fotball|Sogndal]]\n|team2=DJE|name_DJE=[[SK Djerv 1919|Djerv 1919]]\n|team3=VID|name_VID=[[FK Vidar|Vidar]]\n|team4=FRE|name_FRE=[[Fredrikstad FK|Fredrikstad]]\n|team5=D/F|name_D/F=[[Dr\u00f8bak/Frogn IL|Dr\u00f8bak/Frogn]]\n|team6=FAA|name_FAA=[[Faaberg Fotball|Faaberg]]\n|team7=ODD|name_ODD=[[Odds BK|Odd]]\n|team8=VIK|name_VIK=[[Viking FK|Viking]]\n|team9=VRD|name_VRD=[[SK Vard Haugesund|Vard]]\n|team10=RAU|name_RAU=[[Raufoss Fotball|Raufoss]]\n|team11=R\u00c5D|name_R\u00c5D=[[R\u00e5de IL|R\u00e5de]]\n|team12=VEG|name_VEG=[[IL Varegg|Varegg]]\n\n|win_SOG=13|PKwin_SOG=4|PKloss_SOG=2|loss_SOG=3|gf_SOG=43|ga_SOG=21|status_SOG=C,P\n|win_DJE=13|PKwin_DJE=0|PKloss_DJE=5|loss_DJE=4|gf_DJE=36|ga_DJE=22|status_DJE=O,P\n|win_VID=13|PKwin_VID=1|PKloss_VID=2|loss_VID=6 |gf_VID=48|ga_VID=34\n|win_FRE=13|PKwin_FRE=0|PKloss_FRE=1|loss_FRE=8 |gf_FRE=50|ga_FRE=38\n|win_D/F=8 |PKwin_D/F=4|PKloss_D/F=3|loss_D/F=7 |gf_D/F=33|ga_D/F=21\n|win_FAA=8 |PKwin_FAA=3|PKloss_FAA=5|loss_FAA=6 |gf_FAA=26|ga_FAA=27\n|win_ODD=9 |PKwin_ODD=1|PKloss_ODD=4|loss_ODD=8 |gf_ODD=41|ga_ODD=31\n|win_VIK=7 |PKwin_VIK=5|PKloss_VIK=1|loss_VIK=9 |gf_VIK=31|ga_VIK=27\n|win_VRD=6 |PKwin_VRD=5|PKloss_VRD=1|loss_VRD=10|gf_VRD=25|ga_VRD=32\n|win_RAU=6 |PKwin_RAU=2|PKloss_RAU=2|loss_RAU=12|gf_RAU=24|ga_RAU=48|status_RAU=R\n|win_R\u00c5D=3 |PKwin_R\u00c5D=2|PKloss_R\u00c5D=4|loss_R\u00c5D=13|gf_R\u00c5D=23|ga_R\u00c5D=45|status_R\u00c5D=R\n|win_VEG=2 |PKwin_VEG=4|PKloss_VEG=1|loss_VEG=15|gf_VEG=24|ga_VEG=58|status_VEG=R\n\n|col_PRO=green1|text_PRO=Promotion to [[1988 1. divisjon|1. divisjon]]\n|result1=PRO\n|col_PO=green3|text_PO=Qualification for the [[#Promotion play-offs|promotion play-offs]]\n|result2=PO\n|col_REL=red1|text_REL=Relegation to [[2. divisjon|3. divisjon]]\n|result10=REL|result11=REL|result12=REL\n\n|show_limit=5\n|class_rules=1) points;

This rule, suggested by [[Tom A.
