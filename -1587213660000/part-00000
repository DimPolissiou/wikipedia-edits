Although the Drinker model was effective and saved lives, its widespread use was hindered by the fact that the machines were very large, heavy (about 750 lbs), bulky, and expensive. In the US, an adult machine cost about $2000 in 1930, and \u00a32000 delivered to Melbourne in 1936. The cost in Europe in the mid-1950s was around \u00a31500.

Within a few minutes walk of this suburban-urban bulk of Hersham in the east are green fields and meadows alongside the [[River Mole]] and  footpaths by fields used for mixed farming.\n\nHersham is served by [[Hersham railway station|Hersham]] and [[Walton-on-Thames railway station]]s with a minimum of two trains per hour and differing types of services on the [[South West Main Line]].\n\nTwo golf courses are within its bounds, Burhill Golf Club and Hersham Village Golf Club; considerable other land is wooded, used for mixed farming or [[Esher RFC|Esher Rugby Club]]{{#tag:ref|Although based in [[Esher]] between 1923 and approximately 1939, Esher RFC have occupied  land in Hersham since this date and expanded this to {{convert|23|acres}} and a 1,200 seater stand main pitch.<ref>[http://www.esherrugby.com/info/history#.Ukk8pnNDvb8 Esher RFC - History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003010954/http://www.esherrugby.com/info/history#.Ukk8pnNDvb8 |date=3 October 2013 }} Retrieved 2013-09-30</ref>|group= n}}, much of which is [[Metropolitan Green Belt]].\n\n==History==\nAccording to ''Hersham in Surrey'':<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Hersham-Surrey-history-Borough-Elmbridge/dp/B00314FRTG Hersham in Surrey: a brief local history of the parish of St. Peter's, Hersham, in the Borough of Elmbridge in Surrey], George Greenwood, publisher: Elmbridge Borough Council, 1986</ref>\n{{quote|Hersham began as a strip of woodland beside the River Mole.

These date mostly from the [[mesolithic]] period. Somewhere around 200 B.C. a huge defensive earthwork was erected on top of [[Saint George's Hill|St George's Hill]] (ecclesiastically in Hersham, but in Weybridge [[post town]]), probably as a refuge camp against invaders coming up the [[Thames Valley]].}}\nThat this could have been constructed at all indicates a fairly large population in the district, a chieftain of some sort, organised labour and a desperate perhaps recurring danger. [[Bronze Age Britain|Bronze]] and [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]] burials have been found on the slopes of the hill which was clearly a feature of some importance in ancient times.\n\nThe [[Anglo-Saxons]] may well have been the first permanent settlers here; they gave the name to the place and no older remains of actual dwellings in areas not mentioned above have been found.

The dividing line was what then officially termed the \"[[South West Main Line|London and South Western Railway line]]\" and all borders remain almost unchanged by later local government and ecclesiastical parish decisions.  The present [[Church of England|Anglican]] church of St. Peter was built by Mr. J. L. Pearson, R.A., in 1887. It is of brick and stone in 13th-century style. It has a nave and aisles, of five arcades, chancel, transepts, and a western tower and spire. Its site was given by [[British Army|Lieut.
