The novel presented a number of particular difficulties in translation, not the least of which is that there are ten or so pages written in a made-up language that is a mixture of Latin, medieval Italian and other languages (intended to reconstruct how a barely-literate Italian peasant boy of the 12th century would have tried to write in the vernacular).\n\n[[Saint Baudolino]], a historically attested hermit of the eighth century, is the Patron Saint of Alessandria, and thus it would be natural for a boy born there to bear his name. \n\n==Plot summary==\nIn the year of 1204, Baudolino of [[Alessandria]] enters [[Constantinople]], unaware of the [[Fourth Crusade]] that has thrown the city into chaos. In the confusion, he meets [[Niketas Choniates]] and saves his life. Niketas is amazed by his language genius, speaking many languages he has never heard, and on the question: if he is not part of the crusade, who is he? Baudolino begins to recount his life story to Niketas.\n\nHis story begins in 1155, when Baudolino \u2013 a highly talented Italian peasant boy \u2013 is sold to and adopted by the emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I]]. At court and on the battlefield, he is educated in reading and writing [[Latin]] and learns about the power struggles and battles of northern [[Italy]] at the time. He is sent to [[Paris]] to become a scholar.\n\nIn Paris, he gains friends (such as the [[Archpoet]], Abdul, [[Robert de Boron]] and [[Kyot]], the purported source of [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]'s ''[[Parzival]]'') and learns about the legendary kingdom of [[Prester John]]. From this event onward, Baudolino dreams of reaching this fabled land.\n\nThe earlier parts of the story follow the general historical and geographical outlines of 12th-century Europe, with special emphasis on the Emperor Frederick's futile efforts to subdue the increasingly independent and assertive city states of Northern Italy. Baudolino, being both a beloved adopted son to the Emperor and a loyal native of the newly founded and highly rebellious town of [[Alessandria]], plays a key role in effecting reconciliation between the Emperor and the Alessandria townspeople, who are led by Baudolino's biological father; a way is found for the Emperor to recognize Alessandria's independence without losing face. (It is no accident that Alessandria is Umberto Eco's own hometown.) During the siege, Baudolino works on the side of Frederick Barbarossa, but concocts a plan to help win the Alessandrian townspeople some independence. He attempts to convince the emperor's forces that Alessandria is more prepared for a siege than them through stuffing a cow with the last of Alessandria's wheat and sends the cow out to the Emperor's forces. When the cow is cut open, it reveals a full belly of wheat. The emperor's forces are convinced that Alessandria is not worth beseiging, and thus leave.\n\nThe  incident of the death of Emperor Frederick, while on the [[Third Crusade]], is a key element of the plot. This part involves an element of [[secret history]] \u2013 the book asserts that Emperor Frederick had not drowned in a river, as history records, but died mysteriously at night while hosted at the castle of a sinister Armenian noble. This part also constitutes a [[Historical mystery|historical detective mystery]] \u2013 specifically, a historical [[locked room mystery]] \u2013 with various suspects suggested, each of whom had a clever means of killing the Emperor, and with Baudolino acting as the detective.\n\nAfter the Emperor's death, Baudolino and his friends set off on a long journey, encompassing 15 years, to find the Kingdom of Prester John. From the moment when they depart eastwards, the book becomes pure fantasy \u2013 the lands which the band travels bearing no resemblance to the continent of Asia at that or any other historical time, being rather derived from the various myths which Europeans had about Asia \u2013 including the aforementioned Christian myth of the Kingdom of Prester John, as well as the Jewish myth of the [[Ten Lost Tribes]] and the River [[Sambation]], and some earlier accounts provided by [[Herodotos]]. Baudolino meets [[eunuch]]s, [[unicorn]]s, [[Blemmyes (legendary creatures)|Blemmyes]], [[Monopod (creature)|skiapods]] and [[Pygmy (Greek mythology)|pygmies]]. At one point, he falls in love with a female [[satyr]]-like creature who recounts to him the full [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] creation myth; [[Gnosticism]] is a pervasive presence in another of Eco's novels, ''[[Foucault's Pendulum]]''. Philosophical debates are mixed with comedy, epic adventure and creatures drawn from the strangest medieval bestiaries.\n\nAfter many disastrous adventures, the destruction of Prester John's Kingdom by the [[Hephthalites|White Huns]] followed by a long stint of slavery at the hands of the [[Rashid_ad-Din_Sinan|Old Man of the Mountain]], Baudolino and surviving members of his band of friends return to Constantinople undergoing the agony of the Fourth Crusade \u2013 the book's starting point. The wise and rather cynical Niketas Choniates helps Baudolino to at last discover the truth about how the Emperor Frederick died \u2013 with shattering results for Baudolino and his friends.\n \n===Characters in ''Baudolino''===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"right\" width=\"250\"\n| [[Image:Nuremberg chronicles - Strange People - Umbrella Foot (XIIr).jpg|center|125px|Umbrella Foot]]\n| [[Image:Image-Schedel'sche Weltchronik-Devil man.jpg|center|125px|Devil Man]]\n|-\n| [[Image:Nuremberg chronicles - Strange People - Headless (XIIr).jpg|center|125px|Headless]]\n| [[Image:Schedel'sche Weltchronik-Large ears.jpg|center|125px|Large Ears]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | Various strange characters figuring in the novel as rendered in the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicles]]''.

It was written by Isaac Phillips, [[Kenisha Pratt]], Kenneth Pratt and [[Timbaland]] for her [[Afrodisiac (Brandy album)|same-titled fourth studio album]] (2004), with production was handled by the latter. One of the first songs Norwood and Timbaland collaborated on, the record is an uptempo\u2013[[offbeat (music)|offbeat]] [[contemporary R&B]] song with pop and [[dance-pop]] elements, built along on a flute, [[Afro-Caribbean music]] influences and [[Electronic dance music|1980s electro sound]]s. Considered by Norwood as one of her favorites on the album, the track expresses a female's addictive passion for a special person, whom she declares her very own [[aphrodisiac]].\n\nThe song was met with the acclaim of contemporary critics. Many praised Norwood's versatility and considered it as one of the stand-out tracks on ''Afrodisiac'' for having an innovative and different production when compared to the others. Released as the album's second international single in Europe and Oceania during the third and fourth quarter of 2004, \"Afrodisiac\" reached number eleven on the [[UK Singles Chart]], its highest peak, as well as the top thirty in France and Ireland, and the top forty in Australia and [[Switzerland]], where it surpassed the success of its [[Talk About Our Love|predecessor]].\n\nThe single's music video was directed by [[Matthew Rolston]] and marked his second collaboration with Norwood following their 1995 video for \"[[Best Friend (Brandy song)|Best Friend]]\". Choreographed by [[Laurieann Gibson]], it was filmed in Los Angeles, California and features Norwood dancing in a water-flooded outtrack world, influenced by white, gold and black color. \"Afrodisiac\" was performed on a few television shows, such as ''[[CD:UK]]'', ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', and ''Billboard Live'', but has since been performed frequently on Norwood's concerts and tours, including the 2009 [[Human World Tour]] and the 2016 [[Slayana World Tour]].\n\n==Writing and recording==\n\"Afrodisiac\" was written by frequent Brandy collaborators Isaac Phillips, Kenisha Pratt, and Kenneth Pratt along with rapper [[Timbaland]], while production was handled by the latter.<ref name=\"AfrodisiacNotes\">{{cite AV media notes |title=Afrodisiac |others=[[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]] |year=2004 |publisher=[[Atlantic Records]]}}</ref> Norwood's vocals were recorded at [[The Hit Factory|The Criteria Hit Factory]] in Miami, Florida, with production overseen by herself; Kenisha Pratt, Kenneth Pratt, and Blake English all served as [[backing vocalist|background vocalists]].<ref name=\"AfrodisiacNotes\"/> [[Jimmy Douglass]] [[audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed]] the track, while English, Douglass, Demacio Castellon, Jeremal Hicks, and Halsey Quemere all assisted in the [[audio engineer]]ing of the track.<ref name=\"AfrodisiacNotes\"/>\n\nThe track was one of the first songs on the [[Afrodisiac (Brandy album)|same-titled album]] that Norwood and her team worked on while recording at the [[Hit Factory|Hit Factory Criteria]] studios in Miami, Florida.<ref name=\"AfrodisiacNotes\"/> An [[uptempo]]\u2013[[Off-beat (music)|offbeat]] [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] song with heavy pop and [[dance-pop]] influences,<ref>{{cite web|title=Album Review: Brandy|work=Canoe JAM!|publisher=[[Canoe.ca]]|url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/B/Brandy/AlbumReviews/2004/07/19/770453.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120710085046/http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/B/Brandy/AlbumReviews/2004/07/19/770453.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 10, 2012|accessdate=March 10, 2012|first=Jane|last=Stevenson|year=2004}}</ref> \"Afrodisiac\" was built along on a flute and a synthesised [[Old school hip hop|old-school]] [[drum machine]] [[Groove (music)|groove]].<ref>{{cite web|title=For years, Brandy has been in...|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-07-06/news/0407070075_1_brandy-coldplay-timbaland|accessdate=March 10, 2012|first=Joshua|last=Klein|date=July 6, 2004}}</ref> Critics also noted an \"orchestra band feel with a definite [[List of Caribbean music genres|Caribbean influence]] and some [[Electronic dance music|1980s electro sound]]\",<ref name=\"contactmusic\">{{cite web|title=Brandy \u2013 Afrodisiac \u2013 Single Review|publisher=ContactMusic.com|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/pages/brandyx01x11x04|accessdate=March 10, 2012|first=Tareck |last=Ghoneim}}</ref> which incorporates a baby-cry sample, that bears resemblance to fellow Timbaland production \"[[Are You That Somebody?]]\", a recorded by [[Aaliyah]] in 1998.<ref name=\"avclub\">{{cite web|title=Review|work=[[The A.V.

It was written by Isaac Phillips, [[Kenisha Pratt]], Kenneth Pratt and [[Timbaland]] for her [[Afrodisiac (Brandy album)|same-titled fourth studio album]] (2004), with production was handled by the latter. One of the first songs Norwood and Timbaland collaborated on, the record is an uptempo\u2013[[offbeat (music)|offbeat]] [[contemporary R&B]] song with pop and [[dance-pop]] elements, built along on a flute, [[Afro-Caribbean music]] influences and [[Electronic dance music|1980s electro sound]]s. Considered by Norwood as one of her favorites on the album, the track expresses a female's addictive passion for a special person, whom she declares her very own [[aphrodisiac]].\n\nThe song was met with the acclaim of contemporary critics. Many praised Norwood's versatility and considered it as one of the stand-out tracks on ''Afrodisiac'' for having an innovative and different production when compared to the others. Released as the album's second international single in Europe and Oceania during the third and fourth quarter of 2004, \"Afrodisiac\" reached number eleven on the [[UK Singles Chart]], its highest peak, as well as the top thirty in France and Ireland, and the top forty in Australia and [[Switzerland]], where it surpassed the success of its [[Talk About Our Love|predecessor]].\n\nThe single's music video was directed by [[Matthew Rolston]] and marked his second collaboration with Norwood following their 1995 video for \"[[Best Friend (Brandy song)|Best Friend]]\". Choreographed by [[Laurieann Gibson]], it was filmed in Los Angeles, California and features Norwood dancing in a water-flooded outtrack world, influenced by white, gold and black color. \"Afrodisiac\" was performed on a few television shows, such as ''[[CD:UK]]'', ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', and ''Billboard Live'', but has since been performed frequently on Norwood's concerts and tours, including the 2009 [[Human World Tour]] and the 2016 [[Slayana World Tour]].\n\n==Writing and recording==\n\"Afrodisiac\" was written by frequent Brandy collaborators Isaac Phillips, Kenisha Pratt, and Kenneth Pratt along with rapper [[Timbaland]], while production was handled by the latter.<ref name=\"AfrodisiacNotes\">{{cite AV media notes |title=Afrodisiac |others=[[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]] |year=2004 |publisher=[[Atlantic Records]]}}</ref> Norwood's vocals were recorded at [[The Hit Factory|The Criteria Hit Factory]] in Miami, Florida, with production overseen by herself; Kenisha Pratt, Kenneth Pratt, and Blake English all served as [[backing vocalist|background vocalists]].<ref name=\"AfrodisiacNotes\"/> [[Jimmy Douglass]] [[audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed]] the track, while English, Douglass, Demacio Castellon, Jeremal Hicks, and Halsey Quemere all assisted in the [[audio engineer]]ing of the track.<ref name=\"AfrodisiacNotes\"/>\n\nThe track was one of the first songs on the [[Afrodisiac (Brandy album)|same-titled album]] that Norwood and her team worked on while recording at the [[Hit Factory|Hit Factory Criteria]] studios in Miami, Florida.<ref name=\"AfrodisiacNotes\"/> An [[uptempo]]\u2013[[Off-beat (music)|offbeat]] [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] song with heavy pop and [[dance-pop]] influences,<ref>{{cite web|title=Album Review: Brandy|work=Canoe JAM!|publisher=[[Canoe.ca]]|url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/B/Brandy/AlbumReviews/2004/07/19/770453.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120710085046/http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/B/Brandy/AlbumReviews/2004/07/19/770453.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 10, 2012|accessdate=March 10, 2012|first=Jane|last=Stevenson|year=2004}}</ref> \"Afrodisiac\" was built along on a flute and a synthesised [[Old school hip hop|old-school]] [[drum machine]] [[Groove (music)|groove]].<ref>{{cite web|title=For years, Brandy has been in...|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-07-06/news/0407070075_1_brandy-coldplay-timbaland|accessdate=March 10, 2012|first=Joshua|last=Klein|date=July 6, 2004}}</ref> Critics also noted an \"orchestra band feel with a definite [[List of Caribbean music genres|Caribbean influence]] and some [[Electronic dance music|1980s electro sound]]\",<ref name=\"contactmusic\">{{cite web|title=Brandy \u2013 Afrodisiac \u2013 Single Review|publisher=ContactMusic.com|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/pages/brandyx01x11x04|accessdate=March 10, 2012|first=Tareck |last=Ghoneim}}</ref> which incorporates a baby-cry sample, that bears resemblance to fellow Timbaland production \"[[Are You That Somebody?]]\", a recorded by [[Aaliyah]] in 1998.<ref name=\"avclub\">{{cite web|title=Review|work=[[The A.V.

Therefore, these cars are compatible only with the converted R142As that feature CBTC. \n\nLike the [[R142 (New York City Subway car)|R142s]], [[R142A (New York City Subway car)|R142As]], and [[R143 (New York City Subway car)|R143s]], the R188s feature the electronic strip map with all stops on the 7 route with an indicator that can be set to either a local or express train.\n\n==History==\n===Timeline of contracts===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!rowspan=3|All planned<br>orders\n!colspan=2|# of converted cars\n!colspan=2|# of new C cars\n!colspan=2|# of new A & B cars\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\" \n| colspan=\"2\"|Total\n| colspan=\"2\"|Total\n| colspan=\"2\"|Total\n|-\n|align=center|Main<br>order\n|align=center|Option<br>order\n|align=center|Main<br>order\n|align=center|Option<br>order\n|align=center|Main<br>order\n|align=center|Option<br>order\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Original proposal<ref name=\"thejoekorner\"/>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"|140\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"|46\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"|320<ref group=note>This was the total of 131 converted [[R142A (New York City Subway car)|R142A cars]] compatible with [[communication-based train control]] (CBTC) and an additional 189 R142A conversion kits.

Likewise, the number of conversion cars was altered to 370. This change was made with the knowledge that only two ten-car R62A growth sets for the mainline IRT would be needed, as opposed to the projected four sets, and thus the MTA and Kawasaki opted to convert two additional R142A train sets in place of manufacturing two new sets. The MTA also decided to have Kawasaki perform all of the conversions at the Yonkers plant instead of 207th Street Shop as part of that contract modification.<ref name=\"modification\">http://i42.tinypic.com/r2oqb8.jpg Modification to purchase document</ref>\n\nThe R188 contract was awarded in spring 2010 to [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries]], who won by default since only two manufacturers qualified and [[Bombardier Transportation]] opted not to bid on the contract citing the small order and large requirement for engineering resources. The contract was specified at $87,094,272 for the base order, which consisted of 33 cars (23 new cars and 10 conversions), and $384,315,168 for the option order, which consisted of 473 cars (123 new cars, and 350 conversions) for a total price of $471,409,440.\n\n===Delivery===\nAccording to a February 2012 update, the MTA had expected to have 8 conversion sets in service by the time that the [[7 Subway Extension]] is opened for revenue service. In addition, the breakdown of the trainsets has been disclosed. Operationally, the R188s are coupled as such: \n{{quote|A-B-B-B-A+A-B-B-B-C-A}}\nwhere dashes signify link bars and the addition sign denotes couplers. Thirty-eight R142A B cars, therefore, were converted into R188 \"C\" cars, in addition to the 38 deliveries of new \"C\" cars (not including the \"C\" cars in the eight new 11-car sets).<ref>http://mta.info/mta/news/books/pdf/120227_1400_CPOC.pdf</ref>\n\nThe 10 converted R142A cars from the base order (7211-7220) were completed in December 2011 at Kawasaki's Yonkers facility and were delivered for testing on the Flushing Line in 2012. The 23 new cars from the base order (two eleven-car sets, 7811-7832, and one conversion set \"C\" car, 7899) were completed in mid-2012, delivered in November 2013, and entered service in December 2013. The 66 new option cars (7833-7898) were also completed in mid-2012 and have been delivered, while the remaining 37 new cars and the 370 conversions were set to be converted and delivered from February 2014 until the 4th quarter of 2015.<ref>[http://mta.info/mta/news/books/pdf/100426_1100_Transit.pdf Page 100 (Document), or Page 108 (PDF reader)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125205940/http://mta.info/mta/news/books/pdf/100426_1100_Transit.pdf |date=November 25, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=DVV Media Group GmbH |url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/10/cbtc-trials-on-new-yorks-flushing-line.html |title=CBTC trials on New York\u2019s Flushing Line |publisher=Railway Gazette |date= |accessdate=August 24, 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn November 9, 2013, the first R188 train, consisting of cars 7811-7821, were placed in service on the '''7''' train as part of its 30-day revenue acceptance test.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mta.info/news/2013/11/18/new-subway-cars-being-put-test |title=MTA &#124; news &#124; New Subway Cars Being Put to the Test |publisher=New.mta.info |date=November 18, 2013 |accessdate=August 24, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140515152907/http://www.mta.info/news/2013/11/18/new-subway-cars-being-put-test |archivedate=May 15, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> After successful completion, it entered revenue service by December 15, 2013. \nBy July 2014, the delivery schedule had slipped by about 6\u20137 months.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web |url=http://web.mta.info/mta/news/books/pdf/140728_1200_CPOC.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140801140126/http://web.mta.info/mta/news/books/pdf/140728_1200_CPOC.pdf |archivedate=August 1, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> However, delivery of the cars sped up; all remaining R188 cars were expected to be delivered by the end of July 2016, but the last R188 cars were delivered in late June 2016.<ref name=\"AM NY\" />\n\n===Post-delivery===\nIn June 2016, cars 7501-7510 and 7928 had their route signs modified with green circle/red diamond LED signs and a LED numbered-route display, similar to those on the R62As originally used on the 7 (and currently on the [[6 (New York City Subway service)|6]]).

Likewise, the number of conversion cars was altered to 370. This change was made with the knowledge that only two ten-car R62A growth sets for the mainline IRT would be needed, as opposed to the projected four sets, and thus the MTA and Kawasaki opted to convert two additional R142A train sets in place of manufacturing two new sets. The MTA also decided to have Kawasaki perform all of the conversions at the Yonkers plant instead of 207th Street Shop as part of that contract modification.<ref name=\"modification\">http://i42.tinypic.com/r2oqb8.jpg Modification to purchase document</ref>\n\nThe R188 contract was awarded in spring 2010 to [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries]], who won by default since only two manufacturers qualified and [[Bombardier Transportation]] opted not to bid on the contract citing the small order and large requirement for engineering resources. The contract was specified at $87,094,272 for the base order, which consisted of 33 cars (23 new cars and 10 conversions), and $384,315,168 for the option order, which consisted of 473 cars (123 new cars, and 350 conversions) for a total price of $471,409,440.\n\n===Delivery===\nAccording to a February 2012 update, the MTA had expected to have 8 conversion sets in service by the time that the [[7 Subway Extension]] is opened for revenue service. In addition, the breakdown of the trainsets has been disclosed. Operationally, the R188s are coupled as such: A-B-B-B-A+A-B-B-B-C-A; where dashes signify link bars and the addition sign denotes couplers. Thirty-eight R142A B cars, therefore, were converted into R188 \"C\" cars, in addition to the 38 deliveries of new \"C\" cars (not including the \"C\" cars in the eight new 11-car sets).<ref>http://mta.info/mta/news/books/pdf/120227_1400_CPOC.pdf</ref>\n\nThe 10 converted R142A cars from the base order (7211-7220) were completed in December 2011 at Kawasaki's Yonkers facility and were delivered for testing on the Flushing Line in 2012. The 23 new cars from the base order (two eleven-car sets, 7811-7832, and one conversion set \"C\" car, 7899) were completed in mid-2012, delivered in November 2013, and entered service in December 2013. The 66 new option cars (7833-7898) were also completed in mid-2012 and have been delivered, while the remaining 37 new cars and the 370 conversions were set to be converted and delivered from February 2014 until the 4th quarter of 2015.<ref>[http://mta.info/mta/news/books/pdf/100426_1100_Transit.pdf Page 100 (Document), or Page 108 (PDF reader)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125205940/http://mta.info/mta/news/books/pdf/100426_1100_Transit.pdf |date=November 25, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=DVV Media Group GmbH |url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/10/cbtc-trials-on-new-yorks-flushing-line.html |title=CBTC trials on New York\u2019s Flushing Line |publisher=Railway Gazette |date= |accessdate=August 24, 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn November 9, 2013, the first R188 train, consisting of cars 7811-7821, were placed in service on the '''7''' train as part of its 30-day revenue acceptance test.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mta.info/news/2013/11/18/new-subway-cars-being-put-test |title=MTA &#124; news &#124; New Subway Cars Being Put to the Test |publisher=New.mta.info |date=November 18, 2013 |accessdate=August 24, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140515152907/http://www.mta.info/news/2013/11/18/new-subway-cars-being-put-test |archivedate=May 15, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> After successful completion, it entered revenue service by December 15, 2013. \nBy July 2014, the delivery schedule had slipped by about 6\u20137 months.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web |url=http://web.mta.info/mta/news/books/pdf/140728_1200_CPOC.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140801140126/http://web.mta.info/mta/news/books/pdf/140728_1200_CPOC.pdf |archivedate=August 1, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> However, delivery of the cars sped up; all remaining R188 cars were expected to be delivered by the end of July 2016, but the last R188 cars were delivered in late June 2016.<ref name=\"AM NY\" />\n\n===Post-delivery===\nIn June 2016, cars 7501-7510 and 7928 had their route signs modified with green circle/red diamond LED signs and a LED numbered-route display, similar to those on the R62As originally used on the 7 (and currently on the [[6 (New York City Subway service)|6]]). This modification was likely done due to the fact that it would make it easy for passengers to differentiate between an express or local train, despite the announcements and digital signage.

This ligament spans the [[syndesmosis]], i.e. the articulation between the medial aspect of the distal fibula and the lateral aspect of the distal tibia. An isolated injury to this ligament is often called a [[high ankle sprain]].\n\nThe bony architecture of the ankle joint is most stable in [[dorsiflexion]]. Thus, a [[sprained ankle]] is more likely to occur when the ankle is plantar-flexed, as ligamentous support is more important in this position. The classic ankle sprain involves the [[anterior talofibular ligament]] (ATFL), which is also the most commonly injured ligament during [[Inversion (kinesiology)|inversion]] sprains. Another ligament that can be injured in a severe ankle sprain is the [[calcaneofibular ligament]].\n\n===Retinacula, tendons and their synovial sheaths, vessels, and nerves===\nA number of tendons pass through the ankle region. Bands of connective tissue called ''retinacula'' (singular: ''retinaculum'') allow the tendons to exert force across the angle between the leg and foot without lifting away from the angle, a process called bowstringing.<ref name=\"Muscolino2016\" />\nThe [[superior extensor retinaculum of foot]] extends between the anterior (forward) surfaces of the tibia and fibula near their lower (distal) ends. It contains the [[anterior tibial artery]] and [[anterior tibial vein|vein]] and the tendons of the [[tibialis anterior muscle]] within its tendon sheath and the unsheathed tendons of [[extensor hallucis longus muscle|extensor hallucis longus]] and [[extensor digitorum longus muscle|extensor digitorum longus]] muscles. The [[deep peroneal nerve]] passes under the retinaculum while the [[superficial peroneal nerve]] is outside of it. The [[inferior extensor retinaculum of foot]] is a Y-shaped structure. Its lateral attachment is on the calcaneus, and the band travels towards the anterior tibia where it is attached and blends with the superior extensor retinaculum. Along with that course, the band divides and another segment attaches to the [[plantar aponeurosis]]. The tendons which pass through the superior extensor retinaculum are all sheathed along their paths through the inferior extensor retinaculum and the tendon of the [[fibularis tertius muscle]] is also contained within the retinaculum.\n\nThe [[flexor retinaculum of foot]] extends from the medial malleolus to the medical process of the calcaneus, and the following structures in order from medial to lateral: the tendon of the [[tibialis posterior muscle]], the tendon of the [[flexor digitorum longus muscle]], the [[posterior tibial artery]] and [[posterior tibial vein|vein]], the [[tibial nerve]], and the tendon of the [[flexor hallucis longus muscle]].\n\nThe [[Peroneal retinacula|fibular retinacula]] hold the tendons of the [[fibularis longus]] and [[fibularis brevis]] along the lateral aspect of the ankle region. The superior fibular retinaculum extends from the deep transverse fascia of the leg and lateral malleolus to calcaneus. The inferior fibular retinaculum is a continuous extension from the inferior extensor retinaculum to the calcaneus.<ref name=\"Standring2015\" />{{rp|1418\u20139}}\n\n===Mechanoreceptors===\nMechanoreceptors of the ankle send proprioceptive sensory input to the central nervous system (CNS).<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=7706334 |url=http://bjj.boneandjoint.org.uk/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=7706334 |year=1995 |last1=Michelson |first1=J.

This ligament spans the [[syndesmosis]], i.e. the articulation between the medial aspect of the distal fibula and the lateral aspect of the distal tibia. An isolated injury to this ligament is often called a [[high ankle sprain]].\n\nThe bony architecture of the ankle joint is most stable in [[dorsiflexion]]. Thus, a [[sprained ankle]] is more likely to occur when the ankle is plantar-flexed, as ligamentous support is more important in this position. The classic ankle sprain involves the [[anterior talofibular ligament]] (ATFL), which is also the most commonly injured ligament during [[Inversion (kinesiology)|inversion]] sprains. Another ligament that can be injured in a severe ankle sprain is the [[calcaneofibular ligament]].\n\n===Retinacula, tendons and their synovial sheaths, vessels, and nerves===\nA number of tendons pass through the ankle region. Bands of connective tissue called ''retinacula'' (singular: ''retinaculum'') allow the tendons to exert force across the angle between the leg and foot without lifting away from the angle, a process called bowstringing.<ref name=\"Muscolino2016\" />\nThe [[superior extensor retinaculum of foot]] extends between the anterior (forward) surfaces of the tibia and fibula near their lower (distal) ends. It contains the [[anterior tibial artery]] and [[anterior tibial vein|vein]] and the tendons of the [[tibialis anterior muscle]] within its tendon sheath and the unsheathed tendons of [[extensor hallucis longus muscle|extensor hallucis longus]] and [[extensor digitorum longus muscle|extensor digitorum longus]] muscles. The [[deep peroneal nerve]] passes under the retinaculum while the [[superficial peroneal nerve]] is outside of it. The [[inferior extensor retinaculum of foot]] is a Y-shaped structure. Its lateral attachment is on the calcaneus, and the band travels towards the anterior tibia where it is attached and blends with the superior extensor retinaculum. Along with that course, the band divides and another segment attaches to the [[plantar aponeurosis]]. The tendons which pass through the superior extensor retinaculum are all sheathed along their paths through the inferior extensor retinaculum and the tendon of the [[fibularis tertius muscle]] is also contained within the retinaculum.\n\nThe [[flexor retinaculum of foot]] extends from the medial malleolus to the medical process of the calcaneus, and the following structures in order from medial to lateral: the tendon of the [[tibialis posterior muscle]], the tendon of the [[flexor digitorum longus muscle]], the [[posterior tibial artery]] and [[posterior tibial vein|vein]], the [[tibial nerve]], and the tendon of the [[flexor hallucis longus muscle]].\n\nThe [[Peroneal retinacula|fibular retinacula]] hold the tendons of the [[fibularis longus]] and [[fibularis brevis]] along the lateral aspect of the ankle region. The superior fibular retinaculum extends from the deep transverse fascia of the leg and lateral malleolus to calcaneus. The inferior fibular retinaculum is a continuous extension from the inferior extensor retinaculum to the calcaneus.<ref name=\"Standring2015\" />{{rp|1418\u20139}}\n\n===Mechanoreceptors===\nMechanoreceptors of the ankle send proprioceptive sensory input to the central nervous system (CNS).<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=7706334 |url=http://bjj.boneandjoint.org.uk/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=7706334 |year=1995 |last1=Michelson |first1=J.

The second is jumping from a height - the body is fractured as the talus transmits the force from the foot to the lower limb bones.<ref>http://teachmeanatomy.info/the-ankle-joint/{{full citation needed|date=May 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the setting of an ankle fracture the talus can become unstable and [[Subluxation|subluxate]] or [[Joint dislocation|dislocate]]. People may complain of [[ecchymosis]] (bruising), or there may be an abnormal position, abnormal motion, or lack of motion. Diagnosis is typically by [[Radiography|X-ray]]. Treatment is either via surgery or casting depending on the fracture types.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n===Imaging===\nThe initial evaluation of suspected ankle pathology is usually by [[projectional radiography]] (\"X-ray\").\n\n[[File:X-ray of frontal tibiotalar surface angle (TTS).jpg|thumb|right|130px|Tibiotalar surface angle (TTS)]]\nVarus or valgus deformity, if suspected, can be measured with the frontal tibiotalar surface angle (TTS), formed by the mid-longitudinal tibial axis (such as through a line bisecting the tibia at 8 and 13 cm above the tibial plafond) and the talar surface.<ref name=Nosewicz2012>{{cite journal|last1=Nosewicz|first1=Tomasz L.|last2=Knupp|first2=Markus|last3=Bolliger|first3=Lilianna|last4=Hintermann|first4=Beat|title=The reliability and validity of radiographic measurements for determining the three-dimensional position of the talus in varus and valgus osteoarthritic ankles|journal=Skeletal Radiology|volume=41|issue=12|year=2012|pages=1567\u20131573|issn=0364-2348|doi=10.1007/s00256-012-1421-6|pmid=22609967|pmc=3478506}}</ref> An angle of less than 84 degrees is regarded as ''talipes varus'', and an angle of more than 94 degrees is regarded as ''talipes valgus''.<ref>[https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/28148791/Chapter_5.pdf Chapter 5 - Radiological morphology of peritalar instability in varus and valgus tilted ankles], in: {{cite book|author=T.L.

The second is ''tibiofibular overlap'', the horizontal distance between the medial border of the fibula and the lateral border of the anterior tibial prominence, with less than 10&nbsp;mm being abnormal. The final measurement is the ''medial clear space'', the distance between the lateral aspect of the medial malleolus and the medial border of the talus at the level of the talar dome, with a measurement greater than 4&nbsp;mm being abnormal. Loss of any of these normal anatomic spaces can indirectly reflect ligamentous injury or occult fracture, and can be followed by MRI or CT.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Evans|first1=JM|last2=Schucany|first2=WG|title=Radiological evaluation of a high ankle sprain.|journal=Proceedings (Baylor University.
