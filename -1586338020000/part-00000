He has scored over [[List of footballers with 500 or more goals|700 senior career goals]] for club and country.\n\nBorn and raised in central Argentina, Messi relocated to Spain to join Barcelona at age 13, for whom he made his competitive debut aged 17 in October 2004. He established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, and in his first uninterrupted season in 2008\u201309 he helped Barcelona achieve the first [[Treble (association football)|treble]] in Spanish football; that year, aged 22, Messi won his first [[2009 Ballon d'Or|Ballon d'Or]]. Three successful seasons followed, with Messi winning three consecutive Ballons d'Or, including an unprecedented fourth. During the [[2011\u201312 FC Barcelona season|2011\u201312 season]], he set the La Liga and European records for most goals scored in a single season, while establishing himself as [[List of FC Barcelona records and statistics#Top goalscorers|Barcelona's all-time top scorer]]. The following two seasons, Messi finished second for the Ballon d'Or behind [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] (his perceived [[Messi\u2013Ronaldo rivalry|career rival]]), before regaining his best form during the [[2014\u201315 FC Barcelona season|2014\u201315 campaign]], becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga and leading Barcelona to a historic second treble, after which he was awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or in [[2015 FIFA Ballon d'Or|2015]]. Messi assumed the captaincy of Barcelona in 2018, and in 2019 he secured a record [[2019 Ballon d'Or|sixth Ballon d'Or]].\n\nAn Argentine international, Messi is his country's [[Argentina national football team#Top goalscorers|all-time leading goalscorer]]. At youth level, he won the [[2005 FIFA World Youth Championship]], finishing the tournament with both the [[FIFA U-20 World Cup#Awards|Golden Ball and Golden Shoe]], and an [[Olympic medal|Olympic gold medal]] at the [[Football at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Summer Olympics]]. His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbler]] drew comparisons with his compatriot [[Diego Maradona]], who described Messi as his [[New Maradona|successor]]. After his senior debut in August 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a [[FIFA World Cup]] during the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 edition]], and reached the final of the [[2007 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], where he was named young player of the tournament. As the squad's [[Captain (association football)|captain]] from August 2011, he led Argentina to three consecutive finals: the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], for which he won the [[FIFA World Cup awards#Golden Ball|Golden Ball]], and the [[2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica|2015]] and [[Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario|2016 Copas Am\u00e9rica]]. After announcing his international retirement in 2016, he reversed his decision and led his country to qualification for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], and a third-place finish at the [[2019 Copa Am\u00e9rica]].\n\nOne of the most famous athletes in the world, Messi has been sponsored by sportswear company [[Adidas]] since 2006 and has established himself as their leading brand endorser. According to ''[[France Football]]'', he was the world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014, and was ranked the [[Forbes' list of the world's highest-paid athletes|world's highest-paid athlete]] by ''[[Forbes]]'' in 2019. Messi was among [[Time 100|''Time'']]'s [[Time 100|100 most influential people in the world]] in 2011 and 2012.

Messi declined the offer, having aspired to represent ''La Albiceleste'' since childhood. To further prevent Spain from taking him, the [[Argentine Football Association]] organised two under-20 friendlies in June 2004, against Paraguay and Uruguay, with the purpose of finalising his status as an Argentina player in [[FIFA]].

He was subsequently included in the squad for the [[2005 South American U-20 Championship|South American Youth Championship]], held in Colombia in February 2005. As he lacked the stamina of his teammates, the result of his former growth hormone deficiency, he was used as a substitute in six of the nine games.

After helping the team defeat Egypt and Germany to progress past the group stage, Messi proved decisive in the knockout phase as he scored their equaliser against Colombia, provided a goal and an assist against title favourites Spain, and scored their opening goal against reigning champions Brazil. Ahead of the final, he was awarded the [[FIFA U-20 World Cup#Awards|Golden Ball]] as the best player of the tournament.

A prolific goalscorer and a creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for [[List of La Liga top scorers#All-time top scorers|most goals in La Liga]] (438), [[List of La Liga top scorers#Top scorers by season|a La Liga]] and European league season (50), [[List of La Liga hat-tricks|most hat-tricks in La Liga]] (36) and the [[List of UEFA Champions League hat-tricks|UEFA Champions League]] (8), and most [[Assist (football)|assists]] in La Liga (181) and the [[Copa Am\u00e9rica]] (12). He has scored over [[List of footballers with 500 or more goals|700 senior career goals]] for club and country.\n\nBorn and raised in central Argentina, Messi relocated to Spain to join Barcelona at age 13, for whom he made his competitive debut aged 17 in October 2004. He established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, and in his first uninterrupted season in 2008\u201309 he helped Barcelona achieve the first [[Treble (association football)|treble]] in Spanish football; that year, aged 22, Messi won his first [[2009 Ballon d'Or|Ballon d'Or]]. Three successful seasons followed, with Messi winning three consecutive Ballons d'Or, including an unprecedented fourth. During the [[2011\u201312 FC Barcelona season|2011\u201312 season]], he set the La Liga and European records for most goals scored in a single season, while establishing himself as [[List of FC Barcelona records and statistics#Top goalscorers|Barcelona's all-time top scorer]]. The following two seasons, Messi finished second for the Ballon d'Or behind [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] (his perceived [[Messi\u2013Ronaldo rivalry|career rival]]), before regaining his best form during the [[2014\u201315 FC Barcelona season|2014\u201315 campaign]], becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga and leading Barcelona to a historic second treble, after which he was awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or in [[2015 FIFA Ballon d'Or|2015]]. Messi assumed the captaincy of Barcelona in 2018, and in 2019 he secured a record [[2019 Ballon d'Or|sixth Ballon d'Or]].\n\nAn Argentine international, Messi is his country's [[Argentina national football team#Top goalscorers|all-time leading goalscorer]]. At youth level, he won the [[2005 FIFA World Youth Championship]], finishing the tournament with both the [[FIFA U-20 World Cup#Awards|Golden Ball and Golden Shoe]], and an [[Olympic medal|Olympic gold medal]] at the [[Football at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Summer Olympics]]. His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbler]] drew comparisons with his compatriot [[Diego Maradona]], who described Messi as his [[New Maradona|successor]]. After his senior debut in August 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a [[FIFA World Cup]] during the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 edition]], and reached the final of the [[2007 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], where he was named young player of the tournament. As the squad's [[Captain (association football)|captain]] from August 2011, he led Argentina to three consecutive finals: the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], for which he won the [[FIFA World Cup awards#Golden Ball|Golden Ball]], and the [[2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica|2015]] and [[Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario|2016 Copas Am\u00e9rica]]. After announcing his international retirement in 2016, he reversed his decision and led his country to qualification for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], and a third-place finish at the [[2019 Copa Am\u00e9rica]].\n\nOne of the most famous athletes in the world, Messi has been sponsored by sportswear company [[Adidas]] since 2006 and has established himself as their leading brand endorser. According to ''[[France Football]]'', he was the world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014, and was ranked the [[Forbes' list of the world's highest-paid athletes|world's highest-paid athlete]] by ''[[Forbes]]'' in 2019. Messi was among [[Time 100|''Time'']]'s [[Time 100|100 most influential people in the world]] in 2011 and 2012.

Messi declined the offer, having aspired to represent ''La Albiceleste'' since childhood. To further prevent Spain from taking him, the [[Argentine Football Association]] organised two under-20 friendlies in June 2004, against Paraguay and Uruguay, with the purpose of finalising his status as an Argentina player in [[FIFA]].

After helping the team defeat Egypt and Germany to progress past the group stage, Messi proved decisive in the knockout phase as he scored their equaliser against Colombia, provided a goal and an assist against title favourites Spain, and scored their opening goal against reigning champions Brazil. Ahead of the final, he was awarded the [[FIFA U-20 World Cup#Awards|Golden Ball]] as the best player of the tournament.

His professional affairs are largely run as a family business: his father, Jorge, has been his agent since he was 14, and his oldest brother, Rodrigo, handles his daily schedule and publicity. His mother and other brother, Mat\u00edas, manage his charitable organisation, the Leo Messi Foundation, and take care of personal and professional matters in Rosario.{{sfn|Balagu\u00e9|2013|pp=31, 143, 570}}\n\nSince leaving for Spain at age 13, Messi has maintained close ties to his hometown of Rosario, even preserving his distinct Rosarino accent. He has kept ownership of his family's old house, although it has long stood empty; he maintains a penthouse apartment in an exclusive residential building for his mother, as well as a family compound just outside the city. Once when he was in training with the national team in Buenos Aires, he made a three-hour trip by car to Rosario immediately after practice to have dinner with his family, spent the night with them, and returned to Buenos Aires the next day in time for practice. Messi keeps in daily contact via phone and text with a small group of confidants in Rosario, most of whom were fellow members of \"The Machine of '87\" at Newell's Old Boys. He currently lives in [[Castelldefels]], a village near Barcelona. Although considered a [[List of one-club men in association football|one-club man]], he has long planned to return to Rosario to end his playing career at Newell's. He was on bad terms with the club after his transfer to Barcelona, but by 2012 their public feud had ended, with Newell's embracing their ties with Messi, even issuing a club membership card to his newborn son.<ref name=\"Here and Gone\" />{{sfn|Balagu\u00e9|2013|pp=576\u2013577}}<ref>{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Wright |title=After Just 72 Hours on the Planet, Thiago Messi Signs for Newell's Old Boys |publisher=ESPN FC |date=5 November 2012 |url=http://www.espnfc.com/blog/the-toe-poke/65/post/1850358/after-just-72-hours-on-the-planet-thiago-messi-signs-for-newells-old-boys |accessdate=25 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Philanthropy ===\nThroughout his career, Messi has been involved in charitable efforts aimed at vulnerable children, a commitment that stems in part from the medical difficulties he faced in his own childhood.

Although the Volkoff character was often portrayed as a villainous Russian, Peruzovi\u0107 originated from [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].\n\nIn the 1970s, he was Bepo of the Mongols [[tag team]], one of the masked [[The Executioners (professional wrestling)|Executioners]] and feuded with [[Bruno Sammartino]] over the [[WWWF World Heavyweight Championship]] as Volkoff. In the 1980s, he was known for teaming with [[The Iron Sheik]], with whom he won the [[WWF Tag Team Championship]] at the inaugural [[WrestleMania]] event, and later with [[Boris Zhukov]] as [[The Bolsheviks]]. In 1990, he turned [[Face (wrestling)|face]] and embraced America, briefly feuding with Zhukov and newly-turned [[Iraq]]i sympathizer [[Sgt. Slaughter]]. In 1994, after a hiatus, he returned as a destitute and desperate character, exploited by [[Ted DiBiase]] as the first member of his [[Million Dollar Corporation]].\n\n==Early life==\nPeruzovi\u0107 grew up in the [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]], which was then part of [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.postandcourier.com/sports/wrestling/did-you-know-that-nikolai-volkoff-ran-for-the-maryland/article_0f5378ca-601a-11e8-b2a1-e3d47d19f018.html|title=Did you know that Nikolai Volkoff ran for the Maryland statehouse?|first=Mike|last=Mooneyham|work=[[The Post and Courier]]|publisher=[[Evening Post Industries]]|location=[[Charleston, South Carolina]]|date=May 27, 2018|accessdate=July 30, 2018}}</ref> His parents were Ivan and Dragica (n\u00e9e Toma\u0161evi\u0107). Despite what he sometimes claimed his actual middle name was not Nikolai but Hrvoje, and his mother's maiden name was not Volkoff but Toma\u0161evi\u0107.

He was on the Yugoslavian [[Powerlifting|weightlifting]] team until 1967, when he emigrated to Canada after a weightlifting tournament in [[Vienna]], Austria.{{sfn|Grasso|2014|page=332}} He received training in [[Calgary]] from [[Stu Hart]], followed by his arrival in the United States in 1970.<ref name=\"Dragica Peruzovi\u0107 - Osmrtnice.hr\"/>\n\nHis brother is Croatian footballer [[Luka Peruzovi\u0107]]. A fellow Croatian-native played the first Soviet Volkoff character in American pro-wrestling. Steve Gobb, born Gobrokovich, wrestled as USSR's Nicoli Volkoff in the 1960s before the character was picked up by Josip.\n\n==Professional wrestling career==\n===Early years (1967\u20131970)===\nWhile trying his luck as a wrestler in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]] in 1967, he met the wrestler [[Geeto Mongol|Newton Tattrie]], who was wrestling for [[Stu Hart]]'s [[Stampede Wrestling]]. During his 1963-1968 tour, Tattrie took Peruzovic under his wing as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and trained the non-English speaking, 315-pound man to become a professional wrestler and [[tag team]] partner. When Tattrie left the territory in 1968 for the US, Peruzovic left with him, working in various territories for The [[National Wrestling Alliance]] including [[NWA Detroit]], the [[International Wrestling Association (1970s)|International Wrestling Association]] and the [[National Wrestling Federation]] where they won tag gold.\n\n===World Wide Wrestling Federation (1970\u20131971)===\nIn 1970 he began wrestling in [[Vince McMahon Sr.]]'s World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) (currently known as [[WWE]]). Wrestling as ''Bepo Mongol'', managed by \"Captain\" [[Lou Albano]] and partnered with Newton Tattrie (as Geeto Mongol) as The Mongols, he captured the [[WWF International Tag Team Championship]] from [[Tony Marino]] and [[V\u00edctor Rivera (professional wrestler)|Victor Rivera]] on June 15, 1970.<ref name=\"OWOW\"/> After losing the title to [[Grady Johnson|Luke Graham]] and [[Camille Tourville|Tarzan Tyler]] in a match over a year later that unified the WWWF International and [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWWF World Tag Team Championship]], Peruzovic left the WWWF and went on to singles competition under the name \"Nikolai Volkoff\".<ref name=\"OWOW\"/>\n\n===Return to the WWWF (1974\u20131980)===\nIn 1974, Volkoff returned to the company and appeared in a memorable match at a sold out [[Madison Square Garden]] and wrestled one of the sport's most famous champions, [[Bruno Sammartino]].<ref name=\"OWOW\"/> In 1976, he was masked as an Executioner as he became the third member along with [[Killer Kowalski]] and [[Big John Studd]]. They captured the World Tag Team Championship, but it was vacated due to a third member interfering. Later he reverted to the Volkoff name. During this time in the WWWF, Volkoff was announced as being from Mongolia. He had a very successful feud with Bruno Sammartino, which started when Volkoff attacked him during an interview segment. They sold-out arenas throughout the Northeast. During this tenure, he began crushing fresh apples with one hand as a sign of what he would do to his opponents. He later had a feud with [[Bob Backlund]] during Backlund's tenure as champion.\n\n===American Wrestling Association; Mid-South; and Japan (1972\u20131984, 1989)===\nLate in 1974, Volkoff moved to the [[American Wrestling Association|AWA]] where he wrestled under the name ''Boris Breznikoff'', managed by [[Bobby \"The Brain\" Heenan]], he used the same gimmick with a different ring name.\n\nFrom 1977 to 1983 he wrestled in Japan for [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] and [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]].\n\nIn 1983, Volkoff wrestled for \"Cowboy\" [[Bill Watts]] in the [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)#Mid-South Wrestling|Mid-South region]].\n\nOn October 29, 1989 he returned to [[American Wrestling Association|AWA]] for a one night appearance as he lost to [[Ken Patera]].\n\n===Second return to the WWF (1984\u20131990, 1992)===\n==== Teaming with the Iron Sheik (1984&ndash;1987) ====\n{{main|The Iron Sheik and Nikolai Volkoff}}\n[[File:Classy Freddie Blassie.jpg|thumb|Volkoff with [[The Iron Sheik]] and their manager, [[Freddie Blassie]]]]\nIn July 1984, Volkoff returned to the renamed WWF defeating SD Jones on Georgia Championship Wrestling and teamed with [[the Iron Sheik]] with the pair being managed by the \"Hollywood fashion plate\" [[Freddie Blassie|\"Classy\" Freddie Blassie]].<ref name=\"OWOW\"/> It was at this point that Volkoff began to sing the [[national anthem of the Soviet Union]] before every match after which the Sheik would grab the microphone and proclaim \"Iran number one, Russia number one\" before exaggeratedly spitting after saying \"USA\", in order to gain even more [[heat (professional wrestling)|heat]] for being [[heel (professional wrestling)#Heel Types|foreign heels]].<ref name=\"OWOW\"/>\n\nThe new team of Volkoff and the Iron Sheik captured the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]] from [[The U.S. Express]] ([[Mike Rotunda|Mike Rotundo]] and [[Barry Windham]]) at the first [[WrestleMania (1985)|WrestleMania]], on March 31, 1985, after the Sheik had knocked out Windham with Fred Blassie's cane.<ref name=\"OWOW\"/> After losing the title back to Rotundo and Windham three months later, Volkoff began to wrestle more in singles competition. He faced [[Hulk Hogan]] for the [[WWF World Heavyweight Championship]] on several occasions in 1985 and 1986 (including a [[flag match]] on ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event II]]'' at the [[Brendan Byrne Arena]]).\n\nVolkoff also feuded with former [[82nd Airborne Division|82nd Airborne]] [[paratrooper]] [[Corporal Kirchner]] throughout 1985 and 1986, defeating him in a \"peace match\" on ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event IV]]''. Their feud ended when Kirchner used Blassie's cane to defeat Volkoff at [[WrestleMania 2]] in another flag match during the [[Allstate Arena|Chicago]] portion of the event.\n\nIn the fall of 1986, Volkoff's manager [[Freddie Blassie|\"Classy\" Freddy Blassie]] sold half interest in his stable of superstars to the \"Doctor of Style\", [[Slick (wrestling)|Slick]] ([[kayfabe]]),<ref name=\"OWOW\"/> giving Slick co-managerial rights to Volkoff. Blassie also shared the contracts of the Iron Sheik and [[Hercules (wrestler)|Hercules]]. This was a storyline aimed at reducing the aging Blassie's active role, and the \"Hollywood fashion plate\" eventually retired in the fall of 1986 at the age of 68. Sheik and Volkoff feuded with WWF newcomer [[Jim Duggan]] for the majority of 1987, including Duggan running to the ring and stopping the Russian's singing before their match against [[The Killer Bees (professional wrestling)|The Killer Bees]] at [[WrestleMania III]] (Sheik and Volkoff won by disqualification when Duggan entered the ring while chasing Volkoff and then hitting the Sheik with his 2x4 while he had the [[Professional wrestling holds#Camel clutch|camel clutch]] on [[Jim Brunzell|\"Jumping\" Jim Brunzell]]).\n\n==== The Bolsheviks (1987&ndash;1990) ====\n{{main|The Bolsheviks}}\nIn late 1987, Volkoff was teamed with [[Boris Zhukov]], another alleged Russian (actually an American wrestler whose real name was James Harrell), to form [[The Bolsheviks]].<ref name=\"OWOW\"/> They feuded with WWF newcomers [[The Powers of Pain]], losing to them at the inaugural ''[[SummerSlam]]'' PPV in [[SummerSlam (1988)|1988]], however The Bolsheviks did not gain the success as did his partnership with The Iron Sheik. As they lost the public eye due to many losses, they eventually lost their manager Slick and were used as a comic relief team losing many matches to [[The Bushwhackers]]. The Bolsheviks never held any titles together, and are perhaps best remembered for being defeated in 19 seconds by [[The Hart Foundation]] at [[WrestleMania VI]].<ref name=\"OWOW\"/> Eventually, by 1990, The Bolsheviks split up. Volkoff publicly ended the partnership prior to a match where he confronted Zhukhov and then started singing \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\", drawing loud cheers from the audience and turning babyface in the process.\n\n==== Babyface turn (1990;1992) ====\nA short time after The Bolsheviks split, Volkoff became a [[face (professional wrestling)|face]] for the first time in his career. His [[List of professional wrestling terms#G|gimmick]] was now that of a recent defector, he became very pro-[[Western world|west]] which led to a feud with [[Sgt. Slaughter]] who had an Iraqi sympathizer role and teamed with the former Iron Sheik, who had recently begun an [[Iraq]]i gimmick under the name Colonel Mustafa.<ref name=\"OWOW\"/> After Volkoff's team defeated Slaughter's team at the [[Survivor Series (1990)|1990 Survivor Series]] ([[Tito Santana]] was the sole survivor), Volkoff left the WWF at the end of 1990.\n\nHe made a brief return to compete in the 1992 [[Royal Rumble (1992)|Royal Rumble]] match, as well as to face Hercules in a house show match on January 29 in Lowell, Massachusetts.<ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/92.htm</ref>\n\n===Various promotions (1991-1994)===\nAfter leaving WWF, Volkoff began competing in the [[independent circuit]]. On May 3, 1991 he defeated his former Bolshevik partner [[Boris Zhukov]] for Trans World Wrestling Federation in Newington, Connecticut.\n\nOn August 8, 1992 he went to Puerto Rico to wrestled for [[World Wrestling Council]] WCC 19th Anniversario 1992 losing to [[The Patriot (wrestler)|The Patriot]].\n\nOn April 4, 1993 he wrestled his former partner [[The Iron Sheik]] to a double count out at Wrestling in the USA event in Livingston, New Jersey.\n\n===Extreme Championship Wreslting (1992-1993)===\nIn 1992 he went to [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] in Philadelphia where he feuded with Vladimir Markoff. On October 2, he lost to [[ECW World Heavyweight Championship|ECW Champion]] [[Don Muraco]].\n\nHe then returned to ECW on October 16, 1993 as he lost to [[Jimmy Snuka]].\n\n===Third return to the WWF (1993;1994-1995)===\n==== One night appearance (1993) ====\nHe returned as a babyface to pin [[Barry Horowitz]] at a ''WWF Superstars''/''All-American Wrestling'' taping on July 6, 1993, in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.<ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/93.htm</ref>\n\n==== Million Dollar Corporation and departure (1994\u20131995) ====\nOn February 1, 1994, Volkoff began a full-time return to the WWF, making a ringside appearance at a Superstars taping in White Plains, New York during a match between Diesel and Mike Moraldo.<ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/94.htm</ref> For the next two months, Volkoff was shown in the crowd, until eventually he became a sympathetic heel by playing the whipping-boy of [[Ted DiBiase]]'s [[Million Dollar Corporation]].<ref name=\"OWOW\"/> Volkoff had [[kayfabe]] fallen on hard times and was forced to take a job working for DiBiase and his new Corporation. As low man in the group he was forced to wrestle matches no one else wanted to or sent out to \"soften up\" opponents for other members of the [[List of professional wrestling terms#S|stable]] as the sacrificial lamb of the group. The disrespect even extended to renaming him \"Nickel & Dime\" Volkoff and DiBiase forcing him to place a [[cent (United States coin)|\u00a2]] on his trunks where the Russian [[hammer and sickle|sickle]] once was along with a sign on his ring attire that read \"Property Of The Million Dollar Man\". The final WWF match for Volkoff was on December 30, 1994 when he defeated jobber Bob Starr in a house show.  Volkoff's final appearance was at the WWF's final show at The Boston Garden on May 13, 1995. During a match between WWF Champion Diesel and Sid, Volkoff made an appearance to chase Sid's manager Ted Dibiase away.<ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/95.htm</ref> Following this last run in the WWF, Volkoff entered a semi-retirement.\n\n===Semi-retirement (1995\u20132018)===\nVolkoff made a brief cameo on an episode of ''[[WWF Shotgun Saturday Night|Shotgun Saturday Night]]'' in 1997 where [[Todd Pettengill]] discovered him [[homelessness|homeless]] sleeping in a box on the streets of New York City. He also appeared at [[WrestleMania X-Seven]] at the [[Astrodome]] in Houston in the gimmick battle royal which was won by [[The Iron Sheik]].\n\nOn November 30, 2001 he lost to [[King Kong Bundy]] at AAWA event in Jersey City, New Jersey.\n\nOn February 3, 2005, Volkoff was announced as one of the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] inductees for the class of 2005. He was inducted on April 2, 2005 by [[Jim Ross]] at the [[Universal Amphitheatre]] in Los Angeles.\n\nIn 2006, Volkoff took part in the [[World Wrestling Legends]] pay-per-view ''6:05 The Reunion''. Managed by the Iron Sheik, he wrestled a match against Duggan. Before the match, he once again sang the national anthem of the Soviet Union and riled up the crowd.\n\nVolkoff made his first appearance on WWE television in over two years on the August 13, 2007 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'' as a contestant on WWE Idol, a parody of ''[[American Idol]]''. Volkoff appeared alongside the Iron Sheik and [[Howard Finkel]], although Volkoff was the only one who sang. Volkoff sang the Soviet Union national anthem, receiving boos from the crowd (despite being a babyface) and was insulted by judge [[Darren Matthews|William Regal]], although judges [[Mick Foley]] and [[Maria Kanellis|Maria]] both praised the performance. In response, Sheik, who was also insulted, went on a tirade until both he and Volkoff were escorted out of the building by security.\n\nThe March 10, 2008 edition of ''WWE Raw'', featured rematches from previous [[WrestleMania]]s. The Iron Sheik appeared along with Nikolai Volkoff to face off against the U.S. Express in a rematch from the [[WrestleMania 1|first WrestleMania]]. However, the match never got started as [[Jillian Hall]] came out to interrupt Volkoff's singing so she could sing [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s \"[[Born in the U.S.A. (song)|Born in the U.S.A.]]\", which the U.S. Express used as their ring entrance music in 1984\u201385.\n\nOn the November 15, 2010, edition of ''Raw'', as part of the \"old school\" theme, Volkoff appeared with the Iron Sheik, singing the Soviet national anthem before being interrupted by [[Santino Marella]] and [[Vladimir Kozlov]], the latter of whom then sung a duet with Volkoff of the Soviet national anthem.\n\nAfterwards, Volkoff worked for various [[independent circuit|independent promotions]] throughout North America. He remained popular on the autograph convention circuit. In June 2013 he threw out the first pitch at a Bowie Baysox baseball game and sang \"God Bless America\" after the pitch. In October 2013, he sang the Soviet national anthem at a show in New Jersey, after being introduced by [[Howard Finkel]].\n\nVolkoff lent his name to a forward for a fiction novel called \"Only The Beginning\" which is set in the 1980s and is about a girl's life during high school. While the book is not wrestling related, the author Jason Strecker was a personal friend of Volkoff's and in the foreword Volkoff responds to his friendship with the author along with the book's message of being of strong character and doing positive actions for others. The book also has a foreword by [[Jimmy Valiant]].\n\nOn the January 6, 2014 \"Old School\" episode of ''RAW'', Volkoff encountered [[Big E (wrestler)|Big E. Langston]] on his way to a match and sung him the Soviet national anthem, to which Langston smiled. Immediately after, Langston walked past fellow Million Dollar Corporation members, [[Ted DiBiase]] and [[Mike Rotunda|Irwin R. Schyster]].\n\nOn the RAW Fallout segment following the September 8, 2014 ''Raw'', Volkoff appeared backstage with [[Rusev (wrestler)|Rusev]] and [[Lana (wrestling)|Lana]] and sang the Soviet national anthem.<ref>{{Citation|last=WWE|title=Nikolai Volkoff joins Rusev & Lana - Raw Fallout - Sept. 8, 2014|date=September 8, 2014|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WobMoezcP8|accessdate=May 31, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn February 28, 2015, Volkoff appeared for the Superstars of Wrestling promotion in Bayville, New Jersey, where he teamed with ECW legend [[The Sandman (wrestler)|The Sandman]] to take on independent standouts Kentucky Bred \u2013 in a 3 on 2 handicap tag match. Before the match, Volkoff and Sandman sang the Soviet national anthem and proceeded to drink beer together. The duo squashed Kentucky Bred and then poured beer all over them.\n\nOn March 21, 2015, Volkoff participated at a SICW event taking place on East Carondelet. Volkoff managed and mentored the team of younger wrestlers Ricky Cruz and Red River Jack, while also managing veteran wrestler \"Cowboy\" Bob Orton Jr. to take on the team of Chris Hargas, Bull Bronson, and Attila Khan. Volkoff and Orton appeared in their outfit and gimmick from their WWF days. The team of Volkoff, Orton, Cruz, and Jack came up victorious.\n\nOn March 5, 2016, Volkoff showed up at Night of Legends at Billtown Wrestling in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, sang the American national anthem and teamed with Cash Money, who turned on him to give the win to Koko B. Ware and Jim Neidhart.\n\nOn June 25, 2016 he wrestled his last match in Canada where he defeated the Messiah for Great North Wrestling in Pembroke, Ontario.\n\nOn June 9, 2017, Volkoff wrestled for H20 Wrestling: 1 Year Anniversary in Willamstown, New Jersey as he defeated [[DJ Hyde]].\n\nOn May 5, 2018, at the age of 70, Volkoff wrestled his final match, teaming with [[Jim Duggan]] to defeated the team of Mecha Mercenary and [[Nick Berk|Nicky Benz]] for Battleground Championship Wrestling in Feasterville, Pennsylvania.\n\n==Personal life and death==\nPeruzovi\u0107 met his wife Lynn in 1970, and became an American citizen that year.<ref name=\"Vensel\">{{cite news|last1=Vensel|first1=Matt|title=Retired professional wrestler Nikolai Volkoff turns his energy to helping children |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/bs-sp-nikolai-volkoff-profile-20130910-story.html|accessdate=July 29, 2018|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|publisher=[[tronc|Tronc, Inc.]]|location=[[Baltimore]]|date=September 10, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.mywebpal.com/news_tool_v2.cfm?pnpid=659&show=archivedetails&ArchiveID=1098203&om=1|title=Ex-wrestler finds code of conduct|date=March 30, 2005|last=Sears|first=Bryan P.|work=Towson Times|location=[[Walla Walla, Washington]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926213111/http://news.mywebpal.com/news_tool_v2.cfm?pnpid=659&show=archivedetails&ArchiveID=1098203&om=1|archivedate=September 26, 2007}}</ref> In Freddie Blassie's [[autobiography]] ''Listen, You Pencil Neck Geeks'', [[Freddie Blassie]] describes Peruzovi\u0107 as a \"good family man\" who helped Blassie reconnect with a daughter from whom he had been estranged for many years.

better known by his [[ring name]] of '''Nikolai Volkoff''', was a [[Croatian Americans|Croatian-American]] [[professional wrestler]] who was best known for his performances in the [[World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF). Although the Volkoff character was often portrayed as a villainous Russian, Peruzovi\u0107 originated from [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].\n\nIn the 1970s, he was Bepo of the Mongols [[tag team]], one of the masked [[The Executioners (professional wrestling)|Executioners]] and feuded with [[Bruno Sammartino]] over the [[WWWF World Heavyweight Championship]] as Volkoff. In the 1980s, he was known for teaming with [[The Iron Sheik]], with whom he won the [[WWF Tag Team Championship]] at the inaugural [[WrestleMania]] event, and later with [[Boris Zhukov]] as [[The Bolsheviks]]. In 1990, he turned [[Face (wrestling)|face]] and embraced America, briefly feuding with Zhukov and newly-turned [[Iraq]]i sympathizer [[Sgt. Slaughter]]. In 1994, after a hiatus, he returned as a destitute and desperate character, exploited by [[Ted DiBiase]] as the first member of his [[Million Dollar Corporation]].\n\n==Early life==\nPeruzovi\u0107 grew up in the [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]], which was then part of [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.postandcourier.com/sports/wrestling/did-you-know-that-nikolai-volkoff-ran-for-the-maryland/article_0f5378ca-601a-11e8-b2a1-e3d47d19f018.html|title=Did you know that Nikolai Volkoff ran for the Maryland statehouse?|first=Mike|last=Mooneyham|work=[[The Post and Courier]]|publisher=[[Evening Post Industries]]|location=[[Charleston, South Carolina]]|date=May 27, 2018|accessdate=July 30, 2018}}</ref> His parents were Ivan and Dragica (n\u00e9e Toma\u0161evi\u0107).

He was on the Yugoslavian [[Powerlifting|weightlifting]] team until 1967, when he emigrated to Canada after a weightlifting tournament in [[Vienna]], Austria.{{sfn|Grasso|2014|page=332}} He received training in [[Calgary]] from [[Stu Hart]], followed by his arrival in the United States in 1970.<ref name=\"Dragica Peruzovi\u0107 - Osmrtnice.hr\"/>\n\nHis brother is Croatian footballer [[Luka Peruzovi\u0107]]. A fellow Croatian-native played the first Soviet Volkoff character in American pro-wrestling. Steve Gobb, born Gobrokovich, wrestled as USSR's Nicoli Volkoff in the 1960s before the character was picked up by Josip.\n\n==Professional wrestling career==\n===Early years (1967\u20131970)===\nWhile trying his luck as a wrestler in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]] in 1967, he met the wrestler [[Geeto Mongol|Newton Tattrie]], who was wrestling for [[Stu Hart]]'s [[Stampede Wrestling]]. During his 1963-1968 tour, Tattrie took Peruzovic under his wing as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and trained the non-English speaking, 315 pound man to become a professional wrestler and [[tag team]] partner. When Tattrie left the territory in 1968 for the US, Peruzovic left with him, working in various territories for The [[National Wrestling Alliance]] including [[NWA Detroit]], the [[International Wrestling Association (1970s)|International Wrestling Association]] and the [[National Wrestling Federation]] where they won tag gold.\n\n===World Wide Wrestling Federation (1970\u20131971)===\nIn 1970 he began wrestling in  [[Vince McMahon Sr.]]'s World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) (currently known as [[WWE]]). Wrestling as ''Bepo Mongol'', managed by \"Captain\" [[Lou Albano]] and partnered with Newton Tattrie (as Geeto Mongol) as The Mongols, he captured the [[WWF International Tag Team Championship]] from [[Tony Marino]] and [[V\u00edctor Rivera (professional wrestler)|Victor Rivera]] on June 15, 1970.<ref name=\"OWOW\"/> After losing the title to [[Grady Johnson|Luke Graham]] and [[Camille Tourville|Tarzan Tyler]] in a match over a year later that unified the WWWF International and [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWWF World Tag Team Championship]], Peruzovic left the WWWF and went on to singles competition under the name \"Nikolai Volkoff\".<ref name=\"OWOW\"/>\n\n===Return to the WWWF (1974\u20131980)===\nIn 1974, Volkoff returned to the company and appeared in a memorable match at a sold out [[Madison Square Garden]] and wrestled one of the sport's most famous champions, [[Bruno Sammartino]].<ref name=\"OWOW\"/> In 1976, he was masked as an Executioner as he became the third member along with [[Killer Kowalski]] and [[Big John Studd]]. They captured the World Tag Team Championship, but it was vacated due to a third member interfering. Later he reverted to the Volkoff name. During this time in the WWWF, Volkoff was announced as being from Mongolia. He had a very successful feud with Bruno Sammartino, which started when Volkoff attacked him during an interview segment. They sold-out arenas throughout the Northeast. During this tenure, he began crushing fresh apples with one hand as a sign of what he would do to his opponents. He later had a feud with [[Bob Backlund]] during Backlund's tenure as champion.\n\n===American Wrestling Association; Mid-South; and Japan (1972\u20131984, 1989)===\nLate in 1974, Volkoff moved to the [[American Wrestling Association|AWA]] where he wrestled under the name ''Boris Breznikoff'', managed by [[Bobby \"The Brain\" Heenan]], he used the same gimmick with a different ring name.\n\nFrom 1977 to 1983 he wrestled in Japan for [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] and [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]].\n\nIn 1983, Volkoff wrestled for \"Cowboy\" [[Bill Watts]] in the [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)#Mid-South Wrestling|Mid-South region]].\n\nOn October 29, 1989 he returned to [[American Wrestling Association|AWA]] for a one night appearance as he lost to [[Ken Patera]].\n\n===Second return to the WWF (1984\u20131990, 1992)===\n==== Teaming with the Iron Sheik (1984&ndash;1987) ====\n{{main|The Iron Sheik and Nikolai Volkoff}}\n[[File:Classy Freddie Blassie.jpg|thumb|Volkoff with [[The Iron Sheik]] and their manager, [[Freddie Blassie]]]]\nIn July 1984, Volkoff returned to the renamed WWF defeating SD Jones on Georgia Championship Wrestling and teamed with [[the Iron Sheik]] with the pair being managed by the \"Hollywood fashion plate\" [[Freddie Blassie|\"Classy\" Freddie Blassie]].<ref name=\"OWOW\"/> It was at this point that Volkoff began to sing the [[national anthem of the Soviet Union]] before every match after which the Sheik would grab the microphone and proclaim \"Iran number one, Russia number one\" before exaggeratedly spitting after saying \"USA\", in order to gain even more [[heat (professional wrestling)|heat]] for being [[heel (professional wrestling)#Heel Types|foreign heels]].<ref name=\"OWOW\"/>\n\nThe new team of Volkoff and the Iron Sheik captured the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]] from [[The U.S. Express]] ([[Mike Rotunda|Mike Rotundo]] and [[Barry Windham]]) at the first [[WrestleMania (1985)|WrestleMania]], on March 31, 1985, after the Sheik had knocked out Windham with Fred Blassie's cane.<ref name=\"OWOW\"/> After losing the title back to Rotundo and Windham three months later, Volkoff began to wrestle more in singles competition. He faced [[Hulk Hogan]] for the [[WWF World Heavyweight Championship]] on several occasions in 1985 and 1986 (including a [[flag match]] on ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event II]]'' at the [[Brendan Byrne Arena]]).\n\nVolkoff also feuded with former [[82nd Airborne Division|82nd Airborne]] [[paratrooper]] [[Corporal Kirchner]] throughout 1985 and 1986, defeating him in a \"peace match\" on ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event IV]]''. Their feud ended when Kirchner used Blassie's cane to defeat Volkoff at [[WrestleMania 2]] in another flag match during the [[Allstate Arena|Chicago]] portion of the event.\n\nIn the fall of 1986, Volkoff's manager [[Freddie Blassie|\"Classy\" Freddy Blassie]] sold half interest in his stable of superstars to the \"Doctor of Style\", [[Slick (wrestling)|Slick]] ([[kayfabe]]),<ref name=\"OWOW\"/> giving Slick co-managerial rights to Volkoff. Blassie also shared the contracts of the Iron Sheik and [[Hercules (wrestler)|Hercules]]. This was a storyline aimed at reducing the aging Blassie's active role, and the \"Hollywood fashion plate\" eventually retired in the fall of 1986 at the age of 68. Sheik and Volkoff feuded with WWF newcomer [[Jim Duggan]] for the majority of 1987, including Duggan running to the ring and stopping the Russian's singing before their match against [[The Killer Bees (professional wrestling)|The Killer Bees]] at [[WrestleMania III]] (Sheik and Volkoff won by disqualification when Duggan entered the ring while chasing Volkoff and then hitting the Sheik with his 2x4 while he had the [[Professional wrestling holds#Camel clutch|camel clutch]] on [[Jim Brunzell|\"Jumping\" Jim Brunzell]]).\n\n==== The Bolsheviks (1987&ndash;1990) ====\n{{main|The Bolsheviks}}\nIn late 1987, Volkoff was teamed with [[Boris Zhukov]], another alleged Russian (actually an American wrestler whose real name was James Harrell), to form [[The Bolsheviks]].<ref name=\"OWOW\"/> They feuded with WWF newcomers [[The Powers of Pain]], losing to them at the inaugural ''[[SummerSlam]]'' PPV in [[SummerSlam (1988)|1988]], however The Bolsheviks did not gain the success as did his partnership with The Iron Sheik. As they lost the public eye due to many losses, they eventually lost their manager Slick and were used as a comic relief team losing many matches to [[The Bushwhackers]]. The Bolsheviks never held any titles together, and are perhaps best remembered for being defeated in 19 seconds by [[The Hart Foundation]] at [[WrestleMania VI]].<ref name=\"OWOW\"/> Eventually, by 1990, The Bolsheviks split up. Volkoff publicly ended the partnership prior to a match where he confronted Zhukhov and then started singing \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\", drawing loud cheers from the audience and turning babyface in the process.\n\n==== Babyface turn (1990;1992) ====\nA short time after The Bolsheviks split, Volkoff became a [[face (professional wrestling)|face]] for the first time in his career. His [[List of professional wrestling terms#G|gimmick]] was now that of a recent defector, he became very pro-[[Western world|west]] which led to a feud with [[Sgt. Slaughter]] who had an Iraqi sympathizer role and teamed with the former Iron Sheik, who had recently begun an [[Iraq]]i gimmick under the name Colonel Mustafa.<ref name=\"OWOW\"/> After Volkoff's team defeated Slaughter's team at the [[Survivor Series (1990)|1990 Survivor Series]] ([[Tito Santana]] was the sole survivor), Volkoff left the WWF at the end of 1990.\n\nHe made a brief return to compete in the 1992 [[Royal Rumble (1992)|Royal Rumble]] match, as well as to face Hercules in a house show match on January 29 in Lowell, Massachusetts.<ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/92.htm</ref>\n\n===Various promotions (1991-1994)===\nAfter leaving WWF, Volkoff began competing in the [[independent circuit]]. On May 3, 1991 he defeated his former Bolshevik partner [[Boris Zhukov]] for Trans World Wrestling Federation in Newington, Connecticut.\n\nOn August 8, 1992 he went to Puerto Rico to wrestled for [[World Wrestling Council]] WCC 19th Anniversario 1992 losing to [[The Patriot (wrestler)|The Patriot]].\n\nOn April 4, 1993 he wrestled his former partner [[The Iron Sheik]] to a double count out at Wrestling in the USA event in Livingston, New Jersey.\n\n===Extreme Championship Wreslting (1992-1993)===\nIn 1992 he went to [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] in Philadelphia where he feuded with Vladimir Markoff. On October 2, he lost to [[ECW World Heavyweight Championship|ECW Champion]] [[Don Muraco]].\n\nHe then returned to ECW on October 16, 1993 as he lost to [[Jimmy Snuka]].\n\n===Third return to the WWF (1993;1994-1995)===\n==== One night appearance (1993) ====\nHe returned as a babyface to pin [[Barry Horowitz]] at a ''WWF Superstars''/''All-American Wrestling'' taping on July 6, 1993, in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.<ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/93.htm</ref>\n\n==== Million Dollar Corporation and departure (1994\u20131995) ====\nOn February 1, 1994, Volkoff began a full-time return to the WWF, making a ringside appearance at a Superstars taping in White Plains, New York during a match between Diesel and Mike Moraldo.<ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/94.htm</ref> For the next two months, Volkoff was shown in the crowd, until eventually he became a sympathetic heel by playing the whipping-boy of [[Ted DiBiase]]'s [[Million Dollar Corporation]].<ref name=\"OWOW\"/> Volkoff had [[kayfabe]] fallen on hard times and was forced to take a job working for DiBiase and his new Corporation. As low man in the group he was forced to wrestle matches no one else wanted to or sent out to \"soften up\" opponents for other members of the [[List of professional wrestling terms#S|stable]] as the sacrificial lamb of the group. The disrespect even extended to renaming him \"Nickel & Dime\" Volkoff and DiBiase forcing him to place a [[cent (United States coin)|\u00a2]] on his trunks where the Russian [[hammer and sickle|sickle]] once was along with a sign on his ring attire that read \"Property Of The Million Dollar Man\". The final WWF match for Volkoff was on December 30, 1994 when he defeated jobber Bob Starr in a house show.  Volkoff's final appearance was at the WWF's final show at The Boston Garden on May 13, 1995. During a match between WWF Champion Diesel and Sid, Volkoff made an appearance to chase Sid's manager Ted Dibiase away.<ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/95.htm</ref> Following this last run in the WWF, Volkoff entered a semi-retirement.\n\n===Semi-retirement (1995\u20132018)===\nVolkoff made a brief cameo on an episode of ''[[WWF Shotgun Saturday Night|Shotgun Saturday Night]]'' in 1997 where [[Todd Pettengill]] discovered him [[homelessness|homeless]] sleeping in a box on the streets of New York City. He also appeared at [[WrestleMania X-Seven]] at the [[Astrodome]] in Houston in the gimmick battle royal which was won by [[The Iron Sheik]].\n\nOn November 30, 2001 he lost to [[King Kong Bundy]] at AAWA event in Jersey City, New Jersey.\n\nOn February 3, 2005, Volkoff was announced as one of the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] inductees for the class of 2005. He was inducted on April 2, 2005 by [[Jim Ross]] at the [[Universal Amphitheatre]] in Los Angeles.\n\nIn 2006, Volkoff took part in the [[World Wrestling Legends]] pay-per-view ''6:05 The Reunion''. Managed by the Iron Sheik, he wrestled a match against Duggan. Before the match, he once again sang the national anthem of the Soviet Union and riled up the crowd.\n\nVolkoff made his first appearance on WWE television in over two years on the August 13, 2007 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'' as a contestant on WWE Idol, a parody of ''[[American Idol]]''. Volkoff appeared alongside the Iron Sheik and [[Howard Finkel]], although Volkoff was the only one who sang. Volkoff sang the Soviet Union national anthem, receiving boos from the crowd (despite being a babyface) and was insulted by judge [[Darren Matthews|William Regal]], although judges [[Mick Foley]] and [[Maria Kanellis|Maria]] both praised the performance. In response, Sheik, who was also insulted, went on a tirade until both he and Volkoff were escorted out of the building by security.\n\nThe March 10, 2008 edition of ''WWE Raw'', featured rematches from previous [[WrestleMania]]s. The Iron Sheik appeared along with Nikolai Volkoff to face off against the U.S. Express in a rematch from the [[WrestleMania 1|first WrestleMania]]. However, the match never got started as [[Jillian Hall]] came out to interrupt Volkoff's singing so she could sing [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s \"[[Born in the U.S.A. (song)|Born in the U.S.A.]]\", which the U.S. Express used as their ring entrance music in 1984\u201385.\n\nOn the November 15, 2010, edition of ''Raw'', as part of the \"old school\" theme, Volkoff appeared with the Iron Sheik, singing the Soviet national anthem before being interrupted by [[Santino Marella]] and [[Vladimir Kozlov]], the latter of whom then sung a duet with Volkoff of the Soviet national anthem.\n\nAfterwards, Volkoff worked for various [[independent circuit|independent promotions]] throughout North America. He remained popular on the autograph convention circuit. In June 2013 he threw out the first pitch at a Bowie Baysox baseball game and sang \"God Bless America\" after the pitch. In October 2013, he sang the Soviet national anthem at a show in New Jersey, after being introduced by [[Howard Finkel]].\n\nVolkoff lent his name to a forward for a fiction novel called \"Only The Beginning\" which is set in the 1980s and is about a girl's life during high school. While the book is not wrestling related, the author Jason Strecker was a personal friend of Volkoff's and in the foreword Volkoff responds to his friendship with the author along with the book's message of being of strong character and doing positive actions for others. The book also has a foreword by [[Jimmy Valiant]].\n\nOn the January 6, 2014 \"Old School\" episode of ''RAW'', Volkoff encountered [[Big E (wrestler)|Big E. Langston]] on his way to a match and sung him the Soviet national anthem, to which Langston smiled. Immediately after, Langston walked past fellow Million Dollar Corporation members, [[Ted DiBiase]] and [[Mike Rotunda|Irwin R. Schyster]].\n\nOn the RAW Fallout segment following the September 8, 2014 ''Raw'', Volkoff appeared backstage with [[Rusev (wrestler)|Rusev]] and [[Lana (wrestling)|Lana]] and sang the Soviet national anthem.<ref>{{Citation|last=WWE|title=Nikolai Volkoff joins Rusev & Lana - Raw Fallout - Sept. 8, 2014|date=September 8, 2014|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WobMoezcP8|accessdate=May 31, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn February 28, 2015, Volkoff appeared for the Superstars of Wrestling promotion in Bayville, New Jersey, where he teamed with ECW legend [[The Sandman (wrestler)|The Sandman]] to take on independent standouts Kentucky Bred \u2013 in a 3 on 2 handicap tag match. Before the match, Volkoff and Sandman sang the Soviet national anthem and proceeded to drink beer together. The duo squashed Kentucky Bred and then poured beer all over them.\n\nOn March 21, 2015, Volkoff participated at a SICW event taking place on East Carondelet. Volkoff managed and mentored the team of younger wrestlers Ricky Cruz and Red River Jack, while also managing veteran wrestler \"Cowboy\" Bob Orton Jr. to take on the team of Chris Hargas, Bull Bronson, and Attila Khan. Volkoff and Orton appeared in their outfit and gimmick from their WWF days. The team of Volkoff, Orton, Cruz, and Jack came up victorious.\n\nOn March 5, 2016, Volkoff showed up at Night of Legends at Billtown Wrestling in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, sang the American national anthem and teamed with Cash Money, who turned on him to give the win to Koko B. Ware and Jim Neidhart.\n\nOn June 25, 2016 he wrestled his last match in Canada where he defeated the Messiah for Great North Wrestling in Pembroke, Ontario.\n\nOn June 9, 2017, Volkoff wrestled for H20 Wrestling: 1 Year Anniversary in Willamstown, New Jersey as he defeated [[DJ Hyde]].\n\nOn May 5, 2018, at the age of 70, Volkoff wrestled his final match, teaming with [[Jim Duggan]] to defeated the team of Mecha Mercenary and [[Nick Berk|Nicky Benz]] for Battleground Championship Wrestling in Feasterville, Pennsylvania.\n\n==Personal life and death==\nPeruzovi\u0107 met his wife Lynn in 1970, and became an American citizen that year.<ref name=\"Vensel\">{{cite news|last1=Vensel|first1=Matt|title=Retired professional wrestler Nikolai Volkoff turns his energy to helping children |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/bs-sp-nikolai-volkoff-profile-20130910-story.html|accessdate=July 29, 2018|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|publisher=[[tronc|Tronc, Inc.]]|location=[[Baltimore]]|date=September 10, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.mywebpal.com/news_tool_v2.cfm?pnpid=659&show=archivedetails&ArchiveID=1098203&om=1|title=Ex-wrestler finds code of conduct|date=March 30, 2005|last=Sears|first=Bryan P.|work=Towson Times|location=[[Walla Walla, Washington]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926213111/http://news.mywebpal.com/news_tool_v2.cfm?pnpid=659&show=archivedetails&ArchiveID=1098203&om=1|archivedate=September 26, 2007}}</ref> In Freddie Blassie's [[autobiography]] ''Listen, You Pencil Neck Geeks'', [[Freddie Blassie]] describes Peruzovi\u0107 as a \"good family man\" who helped Blassie reconnect with a daughter from whom he had been estranged for many years.

In 1785, the astronomer [[William Herschel]] noted a faint reddish hue in the core region of Andromeda. He believed Andromeda to be the nearest of all the \"great [[nebula]]e\", and based on the color and magnitude of the nebula, he incorrectly guessed that it was no more than 2,000 times the distance of [[Sirius]], or roughly {{convert|18,000|ly|kpc|abbr=on|lk=on}}.<ref name=\"Herschel 1785\" /> In 1850, [[William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse]]  made the first drawing of Andromeda's [[Spiral galaxy#Structure|spiral structure]].\n\nIn 1864, [[William Huggins]] noted that the [[spectrum]] of Andromeda differed from that of a gaseous nebula.<ref name=\"Huggins & Miller 1864\" /> The spectra of Andromeda displays a [[wikt:continuum|continuum]] of [[frequency|frequencies]], superimposed with dark [[spectral line|absorption lines]] that help identify the chemical composition of an object. Andromeda's spectrum is very similar to the spectra of individual stars, and from this, it was deduced that Andromeda has a stellar nature. In 1885, a [[supernova]] (known as [[SN 1885A|S Andromedae]]) was seen in Andromeda, the first and so far only one observed in that galaxy. At the time Andromeda was considered to be a nearby object, so the cause was thought to be a much less luminous and unrelated event called a [[nova]], and was named accordingly; \"Nova 1885\".<ref name=\"Backhouse 1888\" />\n\nIn 1887, [[Isaac Roberts]] took the first photographs of Andromeda, which was still commonly thought to be a nebula within our galaxy. Roberts mistook Andromeda and similar spiral nebulae as solar systems being formed.{{citation needed |date=April 2012}} In 1912, [[Vesto Slipher]] used [[spectroscopy]] to measure the radial velocity of Andromeda with respect to our [[Solar System]]\u2014the largest velocity yet measured, at {{convert|300|km/s|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Slipher 1913\" />\n\n=== Island universe ===\n[[File: Andromeda constellation map.svg|thumb|right|Location of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) in the Andromeda constellation.]]\n\nIn 1917, [[Heber Doust Curtis|Heber Curtis]] observed a [[nova]] within Andromeda. Searching the photographic record, 11 more novae were discovered. Curtis noticed that these novae were, on average, 10 [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitudes]] fainter than those that occurred elsewhere in the sky. As a result, he was able to come up with a distance estimate of {{convert|500000|ly|abbr=on}}. He became a proponent of the so-called \"island universes\" hypothesis, which held that [[Spiral galaxy#Spiral nebula|spiral nebulae]] were actually independent galaxies.<ref name=\"Curtis 1988\" />\n\n[[File:\u041d\u0430\u0434 VLT \u2013 \u0434\u0432\u0435 \u0433\u0430\u043b\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0438, \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0438\u043c\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044b\u043c \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0437\u043e\u043c.jpg|thumb|left| Andromeda Galaxy above the [[Very Large Telescope]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Two naked-eye galaxies above the VLT |url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1342a/ |accessdate=22 October 2013 |newspaper=ESO Picture of the Week }}</ref> The [[Triangulum Galaxy]] is visible on the top.]]\n\nIn 1920, the [[Great Debate (astronomy)|Great Debate]] between [[Harlow Shapley]] and Curtis took place concerning the nature of the [[Milky Way]], spiral nebulae, and the dimensions of the [[Universe]]. To support his claim of the Great Andromeda Nebula being, in fact, an external galaxy, Curtis also noted the appearance of dark lanes within Andromeda which resembled the dust clouds in our own galaxy, as well as historical observations of Andromeda Galaxy's significant [[Doppler shift]]. In 1922 [[Ernst \u00d6pik]] presented a method to estimate the distance of Andromeda using the measured velocities of its stars. His result placed the Andromeda Nebula far outside our galaxy at a distance of about {{convert|450|kpc|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"\u00d6pik 1922\" /> [[Edwin Hubble]] settled the debate in 1925 when he identified extragalactic [[Cepheid variable star]]s for the first time on astronomical photos of Andromeda. These were made using the {{convert|2.5|m|adj=on}} [[Hooker telescope]], and they enabled the distance of Great Andromeda Nebula to be determined. His measurement demonstrated conclusively that this feature was not a cluster of stars and gas within our own galaxy, but an entirely separate galaxy located a significant distance from the Milky Way.<ref name=\"Hubble 1929\" />\n\nIn 1943, [[Walter Baade]] was the first person to resolve stars in the central region of the Andromeda Galaxy. Baade identified two distinct populations of stars based on their [[metallicity]], naming the young, high-velocity stars in the disk Type I and the older, red stars in the bulge Type II. This nomenclature was subsequently adopted for stars within the Milky Way, and elsewhere. (The existence of two distinct populations had been noted earlier by [[Jan Oort]].)<ref name=\"Baade 1944\" /> Baade also discovered that there were two types of Cepheid variables, which resulted in a doubling of the distance estimate to Andromeda, as well as the remainder of the Universe.<ref name=\"Gribbin 2001\" />\n\nIn 1950, radio emission from the Andromeda Galaxy was detected by [[Robert Hanbury Brown|Hanbury Brown]] and [[Cyril Hazard]] at [[Jodrell Bank Observatory]].<ref name=\"Brown & Hazard 1950\" /><ref name=\"Brown & Hazard 1951\" /> The first [[radio astronomy|radio maps]] of the galaxy were made in the 1950s by [[John E.

This was detected using a technique called [[microlensing]], which is caused by the deflection of light by a massive object.<ref name=\"Ingrosso 2009\" />\n\n== General ==\nThe estimated distance of the Andromeda Galaxy from our own was doubled in 1953 when it was discovered that there is another, dimmer type of [[Cepheid]].

During this epoch, its rate of [[star formation]] would have been [[Starburst galaxy|very high]], to the point of becoming a [[luminous infrared galaxy]] for roughly 100 million years. Andromeda and the [[Triangulum Galaxy]] had a very close passage 2\u20134 billion years ago. This event produced high rates of star formation across the Andromeda Galaxy's disk\u2014even some globular clusters\u2014and disturbed M33's outer disk.\n\nOver the past 2 billion years, star formation throughout Andromeda's disk is thought to have decreased to the point of near-inactivity. There have been interactions with satellite galaxies like M32, M110, or others that have already been absorbed by Andromeda Galaxy. These interactions have formed structures like [[List of stellar streams#Andromeda Galaxy streams|Andromeda's Giant Stellar Stream]]. A galactic merger roughly 100 million years ago is believed to be responsible for a counter-rotating disk of gas found in the center of Andromeda as well as the presence there of a relatively young (100 million years old) stellar population.<ref name=\"Davidge & McCoonnachie 2012\"/>\n\n=== Distance estimate ===\nAt least four distinct techniques have been used to estimate distances from Earth to the Andromeda Galaxy. In 2003, using the infrared [[surface brightness fluctuation]]s (I-SBF) and adjusting for the new period-luminosity value and a metallicity correction of \u22120.2 mag dex<sup>\u22121</sup> in (O/H), an estimate of {{convert|2.57|+/-|0.06|e6ly|lk=on|abbr=off}} was derived. A 2004 [[Cepheid variable]] method estimated the distance to be 2.51 \u00b1 0.13 million light-years (770 \u00b1 40 kpc).<ref name=\"Karachentsevetal2006\" /><ref name=\"karachentsevetal2004\" /> In 2005, an eclipsing [[binary star]] was discovered in the Andromeda Galaxy. The binary{{efn|name=M31VJ}} is two hot blue stars of [[stellar classification|types]] O and B. By studying the eclipses of the stars, astronomers were able to measure their sizes. Knowing the sizes and temperatures of the stars, they were able to measure their [[absolute magnitude]]. When the [[apparent magnitude|visual]] and absolute magnitudes are known, the distance to the star can be calculated. The stars lie at a distance of {{convert|2.52|+/-|0.14|e6ly|abbr=on}} and the whole Andromeda Galaxy at about {{convert|2.5|e6ly|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Ribas2005\" /> This new value is in excellent agreement with the previous, independent Cepheid-based distance value.

The ultraviolet view shows that these arms more closely resemble the ring-like structure previously observed in infrared wavelengths with NASA's [[Spitzer Space Telescope]]. Astronomers using the latter interpreted these rings as evidence that the galaxy was involved in a direct collision with its neighbor, M32, more than 200 million years ago.]]\n\nBased on its appearance in visible light, the Andromeda Galaxy is classified as an SA(s)b galaxy in the [[Galaxy morphological classification#De Vaucouleurs system|de Vaucouleurs\u2013Sandage extended classification system]] of spiral galaxies.<ref name=\"ned\" /> However, infrared data from the [[2MASS]] survey and from the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] showed that Andromeda is actually a [[barred spiral galaxy]], like the Milky Way, with Andromeda's bar major axis oriented between 40 and 60 degrees anti-clockwise  from the disc major axis.<ref name=\"Beaton 2006\" />\n\nIn 2005, astronomers used the [[Keck telescopes]] to show that the tenuous sprinkle of stars extending outward from the galaxy is actually part of the main disk itself.<ref name=\"Chapman et al 2006\" /> This means that the spiral disk of stars in the Andromeda Galaxy is three times larger in diameter than previously estimated. This constitutes evidence that there is a vast, extended stellar disk that makes the galaxy more than {{convert|220000|ly|kpc|lk=on|abbr=off}} in diameter. Previously, estimates of the Andromeda Galaxy's size ranged from {{convert|70000|to|120000|ly|kpc}} across.\n\nThe galaxy is inclined an estimated 77\u00b0 relative to Earth (where an angle of 90\u00b0 would be viewed directly from the side). Analysis of the cross-sectional shape of the galaxy appears to demonstrate a pronounced, S-shaped warp, rather than just a flat disk.<ref name=\"UC Santa Cruz 2001\" /> A possible cause of such a warp could be gravitational interaction with the satellite galaxies near the Andromeda Galaxy. The Galaxy [[Triangulum Galaxy|M33]] could be responsible for some warp in Andromeda's arms, though more precise distances and radial velocities are required.\n\nSpectroscopic studies have provided detailed measurements of the [[Galaxy rotation curve|rotational velocity of the Andromeda Galaxy]] as a function of radial distance from the core. The rotational velocity has a maximum value of {{convert|225|km/s|abbr=on}} at {{convert|1300|ly|lk=on|abbr=on}} from the core, and it has its minimum possibly as low as {{convert|50|km/s|abbr=on}} at {{convert|7000|ly|abbr=on}} from the core. Further out, rotational velocity rises out to a radius of {{convert|33000|ly|abbr=on}}, where it reaches a peak of {{convert|250|km/s|abbr=on}}. The velocities slowly decline beyond that distance, dropping to around {{convert|200|km/s|abbr=on}} at {{convert|80000|ly|abbr=on}}. These velocity measurements imply a concentrated mass of about {{Solar mass|6{{e|9}}|link=y}} in the [[Galaxy nucleus|nucleus]].

In a large telescope it creates a visual impression of a star embedded in the more diffuse surrounding bulge. In 1991, the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] was used to image Andromeda Galaxy's inner nucleus. The nucleus consists of two concentrations separated by {{convert|1.5|pc|lk=on|abbr=on}}. The brighter concentration, designated as P1, is offset from the center of the galaxy. The dimmer concentration, P2, falls at the true center of the galaxy and contains a [[black hole]] measured at 3\u20135 \u00d7 10<sup>7</sup> {{Solar mass}} in 1993,<ref name=\"Lauer\" /> and at 1.1\u20132.3 \u00d7 10<sup>8</sup> {{Solar mass}} in 2005.<ref name=\"Bender et al 2005\" /> The [[velocity dispersion]] of material around it is measured to be \u2248 {{convert|160|km/s|abbr=on|lk=on}}.<ref name=\"Gebhardt et al 2000\" />\n\n[[File:M31 Core in X-rays.jpg|thumb|[[Chandra X-ray Observatory|Chandra X-ray telescope]] image of the center of Andromeda Galaxy.

P2 also contains a compact disk of hot, [[stellar classification|spectral-class]] A stars.

In 1785, the astronomer [[William Herschel]] noted a faint reddish hue in the core region of Andromeda. He believed Andromeda to be the nearest of all the \"great [[nebula]]e\", and based on the color and magnitude of the nebula, he incorrectly guessed that it was no more than 2,000 times the distance of [[Sirius]], or roughly {{convert|18,000|ly|kpc|abbr=on|lk=on}}.<ref name=\"Herschel 1785\" /> In 1850, [[William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse]]  made the first drawing of Andromeda's [[Spiral galaxy#Structure|spiral structure]].\n\nIn 1864, [[William Huggins]] noted that the [[spectrum]] of Andromeda differed from that of a gaseous nebula.<ref name=\"Huggins & Miller 1864\" /> The spectra of Andromeda displays a [[wikt:continuum|continuum]] of [[frequency|frequencies]], superimposed with dark [[spectral line|absorption lines]] that help identify the chemical composition of an object. Andromeda's spectrum is very similar to the spectra of individual stars, and from this, it was deduced that Andromeda has a stellar nature. In 1885, a [[supernova]] (known as [[SN 1885A|S Andromedae]]) was seen in Andromeda, the first and so far only one observed in that galaxy. At the time Andromeda was considered to be a nearby object, so the cause was thought to be a much less luminous and unrelated event called a [[nova]], and was named accordingly; \"Nova 1885\".<ref name=\"Backhouse 1888\" />\n\nIn 1887, [[Isaac Roberts]] took the first photographs of Andromeda, which was still commonly thought to be a nebula within our galaxy. Roberts mistook Andromeda and similar spiral nebulae as solar systems being formed.{{citation needed |date=April 2012}} In 1912, [[Vesto Slipher]] used [[spectroscopy]] to measure the radial velocity of Andromeda with respect to our [[Solar System]]\u2014the largest velocity yet measured, at {{convert|300|km/s|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Slipher 1913\" />\n\n=== Island universe ===\n[[File: Andromeda constellation map.svg|thumb|right|Location of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) in the Andromeda constellation.]]\n\nIn 1917, [[Heber Doust Curtis|Heber Curtis]] observed a [[nova]] within Andromeda. Searching the photographic record, 11 more novae were discovered. Curtis noticed that these novae were, on average, 10 [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitudes]] fainter than those that occurred elsewhere in the sky. As a result, he was able to come up with a distance estimate of {{convert|500000|ly|abbr=on}}. He became a proponent of the so-called \"island universes\" hypothesis, which held that [[Spiral galaxy#Spiral nebula|spiral nebulae]] were actually independent galaxies.<ref name=\"Curtis 1988\" />\n\n[[File:\u041d\u0430\u0434 VLT \u2013 \u0434\u0432\u0435 \u0433\u0430\u043b\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0438, \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0438\u043c\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044b\u043c \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0437\u043e\u043c.jpg|thumb|left| Andromeda Galaxy above the [[Very Large Telescope]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Two naked-eye galaxies above the VLT |url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1342a/ |accessdate=22 October 2013 |newspaper=ESO Picture of the Week }}</ref> The [[Triangulum Galaxy]] is visible on the top.]]\n\nIn 1920, the [[Great Debate (astronomy)|Great Debate]] between [[Harlow Shapley]] and Curtis took place concerning the nature of the [[Milky Way]], spiral nebulae, and the dimensions of the [[Universe]]. To support his claim of the Great Andromeda Nebula being, in fact, an external galaxy, Curtis also noted the appearance of dark lanes within Andromeda which resembled the dust clouds in our own galaxy, as well as historical observations of Andromeda Galaxy's significant [[Doppler shift]]. In 1922 [[Ernst \u00d6pik]] presented a method to estimate the distance of Andromeda using the measured velocities of its stars. His result placed the Andromeda Nebula far outside our galaxy at a distance of about {{convert|450|kpc|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"\u00d6pik 1922\" /> [[Edwin Hubble]] settled the debate in 1925 when he identified extragalactic [[Cepheid variable star]]s for the first time on astronomical photos of Andromeda. These were made using the {{convert|2.5|m|adj=on}} [[Hooker telescope]], and they enabled the distance of Great Andromeda Nebula to be determined. His measurement demonstrated conclusively that this feature was not a cluster of stars and gas within our own galaxy, but an entirely separate galaxy located a significant distance from the Milky Way.<ref name=\"Hubble 1929\" />\n\nIn 1943, [[Walter Baade]] was the first person to resolve stars in the central region of the Andromeda Galaxy. Baade identified two distinct populations of stars based on their [[metallicity]], naming the young, high-velocity stars in the disk Type I and the older, red stars in the bulge Type II. This nomenclature was subsequently adopted for stars within the Milky Way, and elsewhere. (The existence of two distinct populations had been noted earlier by [[Jan Oort]].)<ref name=\"Baade 1944\" /> Baade also discovered that there were two types of Cepheid variables, which resulted in a doubling of the distance estimate to Andromeda, as well as the remainder of the Universe.<ref name=\"Gribbin 2001\" />\n\nIn 1950, radio emission from the Andromeda Galaxy was detected by [[Robert Hanbury Brown|Hanbury Brown]] and [[Cyril Hazard]] at [[Jodrell Bank Observatory]].<ref name=\"Brown & Hazard 1950\" /><ref name=\"Brown & Hazard 1951\" /> The first [[radio astronomy|radio maps]] of the galaxy were made in the 1950s by [[John E.

This was detected using a technique called [[microlensing]], which is caused by the deflection of light by a massive object.<ref name=\"Ingrosso 2009\" />\n\n== General ==\nThe estimated distance of the Andromeda Galaxy from our own was doubled in 1953 when it was discovered that there is another, dimmer type of [[Cepheid]].

During this epoch, its rate of [[star formation]] would have been [[Starburst galaxy|very high]], to the point of becoming a [[luminous infrared galaxy]] for roughly 100 million years. Andromeda and the [[Triangulum Galaxy]] had a very close passage 2\u20134 billion years ago. This event produced high rates of star formation across the Andromeda Galaxy's disk\u2014even some globular clusters\u2014and disturbed M33's outer disk.\n\nOver the past 2 billion years, star formation throughout Andromeda's disk is thought to have decreased to the point of near-inactivity. There have been interactions with satellite galaxies like M32, M110, or others that have already been absorbed by Andromeda Galaxy. These interactions have formed structures like [[List of stellar streams#Andromeda Galaxy streams|Andromeda's Giant Stellar Stream]]. A galactic merger roughly 100 million years ago is believed to be responsible for a counter-rotating disk of gas found in the center of Andromeda as well as the presence there of a relatively young (100 million years old) stellar population.<ref name=\"Davidge & McCoonnachie 2012\"/>\n\n=== Distance estimate ===\nAt least four distinct techniques have been used to estimate distances from Earth to the Andromeda Galaxy. In 2003, using the infrared [[surface brightness fluctuation]]s (I-SBF) and adjusting for the new period-luminosity value and a metallicity correction of \u22120.2 mag dex<sup>\u22121</sup> in (O/H), an estimate of {{convert|2.57|+/-|0.06|e6ly|lk=on|abbr=off}} was derived. A 2004 [[Cepheid variable]] method estimated the distance to be 2.51 \u00b1 0.13 million light-years (770 \u00b1 40 kpc).<ref name=\"Karachentsevetal2006\" /><ref name=\"karachentsevetal2004\" /> In 2005, an eclipsing [[binary star]] was discovered in the Andromeda Galaxy. The binary{{efn|name=M31VJ}} is two hot blue stars of [[stellar classification|types]] O and B. By studying the eclipses of the stars, astronomers were able to measure their sizes. Knowing the sizes and temperatures of the stars, they were able to measure their [[absolute magnitude]]. When the [[apparent magnitude|visual]] and absolute magnitudes are known, the distance to the star can be calculated.

The nearly invisible halo stretches about a million light-years from its host galaxy, halfway to our Milky Way galaxy. Simulations of galaxies indicate the halo formed at the same time as the Andromeda Galaxy. The halo is enriched in elements heavier than hydrogen and helium, formed from [[supernova]]e and its properties are those expected for a galaxy that lies in the \"green valley\" of the [[Galaxy color\u2013magnitude diagram]] (see [[Andromeda Galaxy#Luminosity|below]]). Supernovae erupt in Andromeda Galaxy's star-filled disk and eject these heavier elements into space.

Star formation activity in green valley galaxies is slowing as they run out of star-forming gas in the interstellar medium. In simulated galaxies with similar properties to Andromeda Galaxy, star formation is expected to extinguish within about five billion years from the now, even accounting for the expected, short-term increase in the rate of star formation due to the collision between Andromeda Galaxy and the Milky Way.<ref>{{cite journal \n|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/736/2/84 \n|title=The Mid-life Crisis of the Milky Way and M31 \n|date=2011 \n|last=Mutch |first=Simon J. \n|last2=Croton | first2=Darren J. \n|last3=Poole | first3=Gregory B.\n|journal=The Astrophysical Journal \n|volume=736 \n|issue=2 \n|bibcode = 2011ApJ...736...84M \n|arxiv = 1105.2564 \n|pages=84 }}</ref>\n\n== Structure ==\n[[File:Infraredandromeda.jpg|thumb|The Andromeda Galaxy seen in [[infrared]] by the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]], one of [[NASA]]'s four [[Great Observatories program|Great Space Observatories]].]]\n[[File:Andromeda galaxy Ssc2005-20a1.jpg|thumb|Image of the Andromeda Galaxy taken by Spitzer in infrared, 24 [[micrometre]]s (Credit:[[NASA]]/[[JPL]]\u2013[[Caltech]]/Karl D.

Dark blue-grey lanes of cooler dust show up starkly against these bright rings, tracing the regions where star formation is currently taking place in dense cloudy cocoons. When observed in visible light, Andromeda Galaxy's rings look more like spiral arms. The ultraviolet view shows that these arms more closely resemble the ring-like structure previously observed in infrared wavelengths with NASA's [[Spitzer Space Telescope]]. Astronomers using the latter interpreted these rings as evidence that the galaxy was involved in a direct collision with its neighbor, M32, more than 200 million years ago.]]\n\nBased on its appearance in visible light, the Andromeda Galaxy is classified as an SA(s)b galaxy in the [[Galaxy morphological classification#De Vaucouleurs system|de Vaucouleurs\u2013Sandage extended classification system]] of spiral galaxies.<ref name=\"ned\" /> However, data from the [[2MASS]] survey showed that Andromeda is actually a [[barred spiral galaxy]], like the Milky Way, with Andromeda's bar oriented along its long axis.<ref name=\"Beaton 2006\" />\n\nIn 2005, astronomers used the [[Keck telescopes]] to show that the tenuous sprinkle of stars extending outward from the galaxy is actually part of the main disk itself.<ref name=\"Chapman et al 2006\" /> This means that the spiral disk of stars in the Andromeda Galaxy is three times larger in diameter than previously estimated. This constitutes evidence that there is a vast, extended stellar disk that makes the galaxy more than {{convert|220000|ly|kpc|lk=on|abbr=off}} in diameter. Previously, estimates of the Andromeda Galaxy's size ranged from {{convert|70000|to|120000|ly|kpc}} across.\n\nThe galaxy is inclined an estimated 77\u00b0 relative to Earth (where an angle of 90\u00b0 would be viewed directly from the side). Analysis of the cross-sectional shape of the galaxy appears to demonstrate a pronounced, S-shaped warp, rather than just a flat disk.<ref name=\"UC Santa Cruz 2001\" /> A possible cause of such a warp could be gravitational interaction with the satellite galaxies near the Andromeda Galaxy. The Galaxy [[Triangulum Galaxy|M33]] could be responsible for some warp in Andromeda's arms, though more precise distances and radial velocities are required.\n\nSpectroscopic studies have provided detailed measurements of the [[Galaxy rotation curve|rotational velocity of the Andromeda Galaxy]] as a function of radial distance from the core. The rotational velocity has a maximum value of {{convert|225|km/s|abbr=on}} at {{convert|1300|ly|lk=on|abbr=on}} from the core, and it has its minimum possibly as low as {{convert|50|km/s|abbr=on}} at {{convert|7000|ly|abbr=on}} from the core. Further out, rotational velocity rises out to a radius of {{convert|33000|ly|abbr=on}}, where it reaches a peak of {{convert|250|km/s|abbr=on}}. The velocities slowly decline beyond that distance, dropping to around {{convert|200|km/s|abbr=on}} at {{convert|80000|ly|abbr=on}}. These velocity measurements imply a concentrated mass of about {{Solar mass|6{{e|9}}|link=y}} in the [[Galaxy nucleus|nucleus]]. The total mass of the galaxy increases [[linearity|linearly]] out to {{convert|45000|ly|abbr=on}}, then more slowly beyond that radius.<ref name=\"Rubin & Ford 1970\" />\n\nThe [[Spiral galaxy#Spiral arms|spiral arms]] of the Andromeda Galaxy are outlined by a series of [[H II region|HII regions]], first studied in great detail by [[Walter Baade]] and described by him as resembling \"beads on a string\".

[[NASA]]/[[European Space Agency|ESA]]&nbsp;photo.]]\n\nM31 is known to harbor a dense and compact star cluster at its very center. In a large telescope it creates a visual impression of a star embedded in the more diffuse surrounding bulge. In 1991, the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] was used to image Andromeda Galaxy's inner nucleus. The nucleus consists of two concentrations separated by {{convert|1.5|pc|lk=on|abbr=on}}. The brighter concentration, designated as P1, is offset from the center of the galaxy. The dimmer concentration, P2, falls at the true center of the galaxy and contains a [[black hole]] measured at 3\u20135 \u00d7 10<sup>7</sup> {{Solar mass}} in 1993,<ref name=\"Lauer\" /> and at 1.1\u20132.3 \u00d7 10<sup>8</sup> {{Solar mass}} in 2005.<ref name=\"Bender et al 2005\" /> The [[velocity dispersion]] of material around it is measured to be \u2248 {{convert|160|km/s|abbr=on|lk=on}}.<ref name=\"Gebhardt et al 2000\" />\n\n[[File:M31 Core in X-rays.jpg|thumb|[[Chandra X-ray Observatory|Chandra X-ray telescope]] image of the center of Andromeda Galaxy. A number of X-ray sources, likely X-ray binary stars, within the galaxy's central region appear as yellowish dots. The blue source at the center is at the position of the [[supermassive black hole]].]]\n\nIt has been proposed that the observed double nucleus could be explained if P1 is the projection of a disk of stars in an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentric orbit]] around the central black hole.<ref name=\"Tremaine 1995\" /> The eccentricity is such that stars linger at the orbital [[apsis|apocenter]], creating a concentration of stars. P2 also contains a compact disk of hot, [[stellar classification|spectral-class]] A stars. The A stars are not evident in redder filters, but in blue and ultraviolet light they dominate the nucleus, causing P2 to appear more prominent than P1.<ref name=\"hubblesite 1993-07-20\" />\n\nWhile at the initial time of its discovery it was hypothesized that the brighter portion of the double nucleus is the remnant of a small galaxy \"cannibalized\" by Andromeda Galaxy,<ref name=\"Schewe & Stein 1993\" /> this is no longer considered a viable explanation, largely because such a nucleus would have an exceedingly short lifetime due to [[tidal force|tidal disruption]] by the central black hole. While this could be partially resolved if P1 had its own black hole to stabilize it, the distribution of stars in P1 does not suggest that there is a black hole at its center.<ref name=\"Tremaine 1995\" />\n\n== Discrete sources ==\n[[File:PIA20061 - Andromeda in High-Energy X-rays, Figure 1.jpg|thumb|center|400px|The Andromeda Galaxy in high-energy X-ray and ultraviolet light (released 5 January 2016).]]\n[[File: Andromeda active core.jpg|thumb|Artist's concept of the Andromeda Galaxy's core, showing a view across a disk of young, blue stars encircling a supermassive black hole.

The emission above 25 keV was later found to be originating from a single source named [[3XMM J004232.1+411314]], and identified as a binary system where a compact object (a [[neutron star]] or a [[black hole]]) accretes matter from a star.<ref name=\"Marelli et al. 2017\" />\n\nMultiple X-ray sources have since been detected in the Andromeda Galaxy, using observations from the [[European Space Agency]]'s (ESA) [[XMM-Newton]] orbiting observatory. [[Robin Barnard]] ''et al.'' hypothesized that these are candidate black holes or [[neutron star]]s, which are heating the incoming gas to millions of kelvins and emitting X-rays. Neutron stars and black holes can be distinguished mainly by measuring their masses.<ref name=\"Barnard Kolb & Osborne 2005\" /> An observation campaign of [[NuSTAR]] space mission identified 40 objects of this kind in the galaxy.<ref>{{cite web|title=Andromeda Galaxy Scanned with High-Energy X-ray Vision|url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4811|accessdate=22 September 2018}}</ref>\nIn 2012, a [[microquasar]], a radio burst emanating from a smaller black hole was detected in the Andromeda Galaxy.
