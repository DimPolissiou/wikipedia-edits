In one post-World War II story line Abner became a [[United States Air Force|US Air Force]] bodyguard of Steve Cantor (a parody of [[Steve Canyon]]) against the evil bald female spy Jewell Brynner (a parody of actor [[Yul Brynner]]).<ref>[https://images.search.yahoo.com/search/images;_ylt=AwrB8pbV83FWlSMAos6JzbkF;_ylu=X3oDMTBsZ29xY3ZzBHNlYwNzZWFyY2gEc2xrA2J1dHRvbg--;_ylc=X1MDOTYwNjI4NTcEX3IDMgRiY2sDYjc0dDFoaGI1bTdsNCUyNmIlM0QzJTI2cyUzRGQyBGZyA21jYWZlZQRncHJpZANxQUo2WnlCeFRuU2VfYVcuZThmZ0dBBG10ZXN0aWQDbnVsbARuX3N1Z2cDMQRvcmlnaW4DaW1hZ2VzLnNlYXJjaC55YWhvby5jb20EcG9zAzAEcHFzdHIDBHBxc3RybAMEcXN0cmwDOQRxdWVyeQNNQXJ5IFdvcm0EdF9zdG1wAzE0NTAzMDg2NTMEdnRlc3RpZANJTUdQUkQ-?gprid=qAJ6ZyBxTnSe_aW.e8fgGA&pvid=papx9jY5LjGzk6GMVlsepA7ENTAuNQAAAABG1YQ7&p=MAry+Worm&fr=mcafee&fr2=sb-top-images.search.yahoo.com&ei=UTF-8&n=60&x=wrt#id=144&iurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.animationresources.org%2Fpics%2Fcapp0427-big.jpg&action=click Parody of Steve Canyon! Sept 15, 1957]</ref> Early in the strip's history, Abner's primary goal in life was evading the marital designs of Daisy Mae Scragg, the virtuous, voluptuous, barefoot Dogpatch damsel and scion of the Yokums blood [[feud]] enemies \u2014 the Scraggs, her bloodthirsty, semi-evolved kinfolk. For 18 years, Abner slipped out of Daisy Mae's marital cross hairs time and time again. When Capp finally gave in to reader pressure and allowed the couple to tie the knot, it was a major media event. It even made the cover of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine on March 31, 1952 \u2014 illustrating an article by Capp titled \"It's Hideously True!! The Creator of ''Li'l Abner'' Tells Why His Hero Is ''(SOB!)'' Wed!!\"\n\n'''Daisy Mae Yokum (n\u00e9e Scragg):''' Beautiful Daisy Mae was hopelessly in love with Dogpatch's most prominent resident throughout the entire 43-year run of Al Capp's comic strip. During most of the epic, the impossibly dense Abner exhibited little romantic interest in her voluptuous charms (much of it visible daily thanks to her famous polka-dot peasant blouse and cropped skirt).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20051217210321/http://deniskitchen.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&Category_Code=bios.daisymae Daisy Mae \"biography\" at deniskitchen.com]</ref> In 1952, Abner reluctantly proposed to Daisy to emulate the engagement of his comic strip \"ideal,\" ''Fearless Fosdick''. Fosdick's own wedding to longtime fianc\u00e9e Prudence Pimpleton turned out to be a dream \u2014 but Abner and Daisy's ceremony, performed by Marrying' Sam, was permanent. Abner and Daisy Mae's nuptials were a major source of media attention, landing them on the aforementioned cover of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine's March 31, 1952, issue.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://cartoonician.com/big-deals-comics-highest-profile-moments/ |title=\"Big Deals: Comics\u2019 Highest-Profile Moments,\" ''Hogan's Alley'' #7, 1999 |access-date=2012-11-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630083743/http://cartoonician.com/big-deals-comics-highest-profile-moments/ |archive-date=2013-06-30 |URL-status=dead }}</ref> Once married, Abner became relatively domesticated. Like Mammy Yokum and the other \"womenfolk\" in Dogpatch, Daisy Mae did all the work, domestic and otherwise \u2014 while the useless menfolk generally did nothing whatsoever.{{citation needed|reason=Is this a specific quote?|date=May 2016}}\n\n'''Mammy Yokum:''' Born '''Pansy Hunks''', Mammy was the scrawny, highly principled \"society\" leader and bare knuckle \"champion\" of the town of Dogpatch. She had married the inconsequential Pappy Yokum in 1902; they produced two strapping sons twice their own size. Mammy dominated the Yokum clan through the force of her personality, and dominated everyone else with her fearsome right uppercut (sometimes known as her \"Goodnight, Irene\" punch), which helped her uphold law, order and decency.<ref>[http://deniskitchen.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&Category_Code=bios.mammyyokum Mammy Yokum \"biography\" at deniskitchen.com]</ref> She is consistently the toughest character throughout ''Li'l Abner.'' A superhuman dynamo, Mammy did all the household chores \u2014 and provided her charges with no fewer than eight meals a day of \"pork chops\" and \"turnips,\" (as well as local Dogpatch delicacies like \"candied catfish eyeballs\" and \"bean soup\"). Her authority was unquestioned, and her characteristic phrase, \"Ah has ''spoken!,\"'' signaled the end of all further discussion. Her most familiar phrase, however, is \"Good is better than evil because it's ''nicer!\"'' (Upon his retirement in 1977, Capp declared Mammy to be his personal favorite of all his characters.)\n\n{{Anchor|Pappy Yokum}}'''Pappy Yokum:''' Born '''Lucifer Ornamental Yokum''', pint-sized Pappy had the misfortune of being the patriarch in a family that didn't have one. Pappy was so lazy and ineffectual, he didn't even bathe himself. Mammy was regularly seen scrubbing Pappy in an outdoor oak tub (\"Once a month, rain or shine\"). Ironing Pappy's trousers fell under her wifely duties as well, although she didn't bother with preliminaries \u2014 like waiting for Pappy to remove them first.<ref>[http://deniskitchen.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&Category_Code=bios.pappyyokum Pappy Yokum \"biography\" at deniskitchen.com]</ref> Pappy is dull-witted and gullible (in one story line after he is conned by Marrying Sam into buying Vanishing cream because he thinks it makes him ''invisible'' when he picks a fight with his nemesis Earthquake McGoon), but not completely without guile. He had an unfortunate predilection for snitching \"preserved turnips\" and smoking corn silk behind the woodshed \u2014 much to his chagrin when Mammy caught him. Pappy Yokum wasn't always feckless, however. After his lower wisdom teeth grew so long that they squeezed his cerebral Goodness Gland and emerged as forehead horns, he proved himself capable of evil. Of course Mammy solved the problem with a tooth extraction, and ended the episode with her most famous dictum.\n\n'''Honest Abe Yokum:''' Little Abner and Daisy Mae's little boy was born in 1953 \"after a pregnancy that ambled on so long that readers began sending me medical books,\" wrote Capp. Initially known as \"Mysterious Yokum\" (there was even an [[Ideal Toy Company|Ideal]] doll marketed under this name) due to a debate regarding his gender (he was stuck in a pants-shaped stovepipe for the first six weeks), he was renamed \"Honest Abe\" (after President [[Abraham Lincoln]]) to thwart his early tendency to steal.<ref>[http://www.deniskitchen.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&Category_Code=bios.honest.abe Honest Abe \"biography\" at deniskitchen.com]</ref> His first words were \"pork chop,\" and that remained his favorite food. Though his uncle Tiny was perpetually frozen at 15\u00bd \"years\" old, Honest Abe gradually grew from infant to grade school age, and became a dead ringer for '''Washable Jones''' \u2014 the star of Capp's early \"[[topper (comic strip)|topper]]\" strip. He would eventually acquire a couple of supporting character friends for his own semi-regularly featured adventures in the strip. In one story line he lives up to his nickname when during a nationwide search for [[George Washington]]\u2019s missing socks (the finder gets to shake the President of the United States hand); after dishonestly producing a fraudulent pair, he confess to the truth at the last second.\n\n'''Tiny Yokum:''' \"Tiny\" was a [[misnomer]]; Little Abner's kid brother remained perpetually innocent and 15\u00bd \"years\" old \u2014 despite the fact that he was an imposing, {{convert|7|ft|m|adj=on}} tall behemoth. Tiny was unknown to the strip until September 1954, when a relative who had been raising him reminded Mammy that she'd given birth to a second \"child\"  while visiting her 15 years earlier. (The relative explained that she would have dropped him off sooner, but waited until she happened to be in the neighborhood.) Capp introduced Tiny to fill the bachelor role played reliably for nearly two decades by Little Abner himself, until his fateful 1952 marriage threw the carefully orchestrated dynamic of the strip out of whack for a period.<ref>[http://deniskitchen.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&Category_Code=bios.tinyyokum Tiny Yokum \"biography\" at deniskitchen.com]</ref> Pursued by local lovelies '''Hopeful Mud''' and '''Boy-less Bailey''', Tiny was even dumber and more awkward than Abner, if that can be imagined. Tiny initially sported a bulbous nose like both of his parents, but eventually,  (through a plot contrivance) he was given a nose job, and his shaggy blond hair was [[buzz cut]] to make him more appealing.\n\n'''Salomey:''' The Yokums' beloved pet. Cute, lovable and intelligent (arguably smarter than Abner, Tiny or Pappy), she was accepted as part of the family (\"the youngest,\" as Mammy invariably introduces her). She is 100% \"Hammus Alabammus\" \u2014 an adorable species of pig, and the last female known in existence. A plump, juicy ''Hammus Alabammus'' is the rarest and most vital ingredient of \"ecstasy sauce,\" an indescribably delicious gourmet delicacy. Consequently, Salomey is frequently targeted by unscrupulous sportsmen, hog breeders and gourmands (like '''J.R. Fangsley''' and '''Bounder J. Round heels'''), as well as unsavory [[boar]]s with improper intentions (such as '''Boar Scarloff''' and '''Porknoy'''). Her moniker was a pun on both [[salami]] and [[Salome]].\n\n===Supporting characters and villains===\n* '''Marryin' Sam:''' A traveling (by mule) preacher who specializes in $2 weddings. He also offered the $8 \"ultra-deluxe speshul,\" a spectacular ceremony in which Sam officiates while being drawn and quartered by four rampaging jackasses. He cleans up once a year \u2014 during [[Sadie Hawkins Day]] season, when slow-footed bachelors are dragged kicking and screaming to the altar by their prospective brides-to-be.<ref>[http://deniskitchen.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&Category_Code=bios.marryin.sam Marryin' Sam \"biography\" at deniskitchen.com]</ref> Sam, whose face and figure were reportedly modeled after New York City mayor [[Fiorello LaGuardia]],<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=fU8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA12&lpg=PA12&dq=abner+capp++time+marryin'+sam+laGuardia&source=bl&ots=C40sJJGW6s&sig=SKcobOOGR19FajlE2iFfJFPPkyE&hl=en&ei=vrpSTv_sGcTYiAKU5JjvDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q&f=false \"Speaking of Pictures,\" ''Life'', 12 June 1944]</ref> started out as a stock villain but gradually softened into a genial, opportunistic comic foil. He wasn't above chicanery to achieve his ends, and was warily viewed by Dogpatch menfolk as a traitor to his gender. Sam was prominently featured on the cover of ''Life'' in 1952 when he presided over the celebrated wedding of Li'l Abner and Daisy Mae. In the 1956 Broadway musical and 1959 film adaptation, Sam was played by rotund actor [[Stubby Kaye]].\n* '''Moonbeam McSwine:''' The unwashed but shapely form of languid, delectable Moonbeam was one of the iconic hallmarks of ''Li'l Abner'' \u2014 an unkempt, impossibly lazy, corncob pipe-smoking, flagrant (and ''fragrant)'', raven-haired, earthly (and ''earthy)'' woman. Beautiful Moonbeam preferred the company of pigs to suitors \u2014 much to the frustration of her equally lazy pappy, '''Moonshine McSwine'''. She was usually showcased luxuriating among the hogs, somewhat removed from the main action of the story, in a deliberate parody of glamour magazines and [[pinup]] calendars of the day. Capp designed her in caricature of his wife Catherine (minus the dirt), who had also suggested Daisy Mae's name. In one comic it is revealed that she bears a striking resemblance to a wealthy, well-dressed and well-washed woman named [[Gloria Vanderbilt|Gloria Van Welbuilt]], a famous socialite. Despite her lazy nature and dirty appearance she was generally good-natured and kind as shown when she ran off to Dogpatch, carrying two shmoos under her arms to save them from going extinct, wondering if humanity would ever be good enough for them. She also consoled Abner to stop worrying about being a father. Moonbeam also seemed to have interests in romance as in some strips she was seen flirting with and even kissing various male characters, including Abner. She once expressed the desire of having a family of her own and she actually discussed the matter of trapping a husband (if she got cleaned up) with Abner. In one strip it was revealed that Moonbeam was in fact in love with Abner when they were children. In the same strip it was shown that Moonbeam\u2019s disposition for filth was born out of a failure to understand the turn-ons of Abner when he was a child. Strangely she actually disliked hogs as a child but after seeing Abner ignoring the openly romantic advances of a clean Daisy Mae, she dived right into a mud-hole headfirst where some hogs were wallowing to earn his love, believing that if Abner didn't like clean girls he must have liked them dirty. Much to her disappointment, however, this, too, failed to capture his attention. Moonbeam was also unknowingly the star of a horror movie directed by Rock Pincus, head film director of a race known as the Pincushions, from  planet Pincus 7. Unfortunately this venture ended in tragedy for Rock when he was unknowingly grilled, put into a hot dog bun and devoured while he was still alive.\n* '''Hairless Joe and Lonesome Polecat:''' The proud purveyors of \"Kickapoo Joy Juice\" \u2014 a [[moonshine]] elixir of such stupefying potency that the fumes alone have been known to melt the rivets off battleships. Concocted in a large wooden vat by the inseparable cave-dwelling buddies Lonesome Polecat (of the \"Fried Dog\" [[Indian tribe]], later known as the Polecats, \"the one tribe who have never been conquered,\") and Hairless Joe (a hirsute, club-wielding, modern [[Cro-Magnon]] \u2014 who frequently made good on his oft-repeated threat, \"Ah'll ''bash'' yore ''haid'' in!\") The ingredients of the brew are both mysterious and all-encompassing<ref>[http://deniskitchen.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&Category_Code=bios.joyjuice Kickapoo Joy Juice page at deniskitchen.com]</ref> (much like the contents of their cave, which has been known to harbor [[dinosaur|prehistoric monsters]]). When a batch \"needs more body,\" the formidable pair simply goes out and clubs one (often a moose), and tosses it in. Over the years, the \"recipe\" has called for live grizzly bears, panthers, kerosene, horseshoes and anvils, among other ingredients. An officially licensed soft drink called [[Kickapoo Joy Juice]] is still produced by the [[Monarch Beverage Company]] of [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Lonesome Polecat was also the official team [[mascot]] of the Sioux City Soos (1940\u20131960),<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Sioux_City_Soos Sioux City Soos at Baseball-Reference.com]</ref> a former [[Minor League]] baseball franchise of [[Sioux City, Iowa]].\n* '''Joe Btfsplk:''' The world's worst [[jinx]], [[Joe Btfsplk]] had a perpetually dark rain cloud over his head. Instantaneous bad luck befell anyone unfortunate enough to be in his vicinity. Though well-meaning and friendly, his reputation inevitably precedes him \u2014 so Joe is a very lonely little man \u2014 so he associates himself with the Scraggs{{nbsp}}\u2013 except in World War II when Joe decided to do his patriotic duty \u2014 and associate himself with [[Hirohito]]!. He has an apparently unpronounceable name, but creator Al Capp \"pronounced\" Btfsplk by simply blowing a \"raspberry,\" or [[Bronx cheer (gesture)|Bronx cheer]].<ref>[http://deniskitchen.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&Category_Code=bios.joe.btfsplk Joe Btfsplk \"biography\" at deniskitchen.com]</ref> Joe's personal storm cloud became one of the most iconic images in the strip.\n* '''Senator Jack S. Phogbound:''' His name was a thinly disguised variant on \"jackass,\" as made plain in his deathless campaign slogan (see Dialogue and [[catchphrase]]s). The senator was satirist Al Capp's parody of a blustering self-serving Southern politician. Before 1947 Phogbound had been known as Fogbound, but in that year Phogbound \"blackmails his fellow Washington senators to appropriate two million dollars to establish Phogbound University,\" and its attendant brass statue of Phogbound, both reminiscent of self-aggrandizements by Huey Long;<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=IuTiI-zzjkkC&pg=PA21&lpg=PA21&dq=jack+s.+phogbound+huey+long&source=bl&ots=iHIo_b2kk2&sig=H6AD0ouBGjXysJc0sOz2VADIwWc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCUQ6AEwAWoVChMI5qWJ-8axyAIVg6CACh0PVApO#v=onepage&q=jack%20s.%20phogbound%20huey%20long&f=false]</ref> the name change allowed Capp to sharpen the joke by calling the university P.U.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=mOE-VOlZDtYC&pg=PA91&lpg=PA91&dq=phogbound+university&source=bl&ots=S723qf4AQn&sig=zdU7Id-3CZpx7dpoMuNTB7VPLmM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CC8Q6AEwA2oVChMI7IGmw8exyAIVytOACh0Jog9l#v=onepage&q=phogbound%20university&f=false]</ref>  Phogbound is a corrupt, conspiratorial blowhard; he often wears a [[coonskin cap]] and carries an old fashioned [[flintlock musket|flintlock rifle]] to impress his gullible constituents. In one sequence, Phogbound is unable to campaign in Dogpatch \u2014 so he sends his aides with an old, hot air-filled gas bag that resembles him. Nobody ''noticed the difference''!\n* '''Available Jones:''' Dogpatch entrepreneur Available Jones was always available \u2014 for a price. He had many sidelines, including minding babies (Dry \u2014 5\u00a2, Other kinds \u2014 10\u00a2). He provided anything from a safety pin to a battleship, but his most famous \"provision\" was his memorable cousin \u2014 Stupefyin' Jones.\n* '''Stupefyin' Jones:''' A walking [[aphrodisiac]], Stupefyin' was stunning \u2014 literally. So drop-dead gorgeous that any male who glimpsed her froze petrified in his tracks and rooted to the spot \u2014 in a word, ''stupefied!'' While she was generally favored by the males of Dogpatch, she could be deadly for a confirmed bachelor to encounter on [[Sadie Hawkins Day]]. Statuesque actress [[Julie Newmar]] became famous overnight for playing the small role in the 1956 ''Li'l Abner'' Broadway musical (and the 1959 film adaptation) without uttering a single line.<ref>[http://deniskitchen.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&Category_Code=bios.stupefyin Stupefyin' Jones \"biography\" at deniskitchen.com]</ref>\n* '''General Bullmoose:''' Created by Al Capp in June 1953, Bashington T. Bullmoose was the epitome of a mercenary, cold-blooded capitalist tyrant tycoon. Bullmoose's bombastic motto (see Dialogue and catchphrases) was adapted by Capp from a statement made by [[Charles Erwin Wilson|Charles E. Wilson]], the former head of [[General Motors]] when it was America's largest corporation. In 1952 Wilson told a Senate subcommittee, \"What is good for the country is good for General Motors, and vice-versa.\" Wilson later served as [[United States Secretary of Defense]] under President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]].<ref>[http://deniskitchen.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&Category_Code=bios.gen.bullmoose General Bullmoose \"biography\" at deniskitchen.com]</ref> Bullmoose had a simple boyhood dream: to possess all the money in the world. He very nearly did. Bullmoose Industries seemed to own or control ''everything''. He had a milksop of a son named '''Weakfish''', and was sometimes accompanied by his delectable \"secretary,\" '''Bim Bovak''' (whose name was a [[pun]] on both \"bimbo\" and [[bombshell (sex symbol)|bombshell]] actress [[Kim Novak]]). Li'l Abner became embroiled in many globetrotting adventures with the ruthless, reactionary billionaire over the years. Despite his adamantine exterior, General Bullmoose was still capable of a kind of capitalist gallantry. \"Those Slobbovians [q.v.] have done me out of a hundred thousand dollars!\" he once exclaimed, after falling victim to a fraud. \"Nearly an hour's income, bless 'em!\"\n* '''Wolf Gal:''' A [[feral]], irredeemable, [[Amazons|Amazonian]] beauty who was raised by wolves and preferred to live among them; she lured unwary Dogpatchers to their doom to feed her ravenous pack. Wolf Gal was possibly, and even probably a [[cannibal]] \u2014 although the point was never stressed since she considered herself an animal, as did the rest of Dogpatch. One of Capp's more popular villains, Wolf Gal was briefly merchandised in the fifties with her own comic book, doll, [[handpuppet]], and even a [[latex]] [[Halloween]] mask.\n* '''Earthquake McGoon:''' Billing himself as \"the world's dirtiest [[Professional wrestling|wrassler]],\" the bearded, bloated McGoon first appeared in ''Li'l Abner'' as a traveling exhibition wrestler in the late 1930s, and was reportedly partially based on real-life grappler [[Man Mountain Dean]]. He also has a look-alike cousin named '''Typhoon McGoon'''. McGoon became increasingly prominent in the ''Li'l Abner'' [[Cream of Wheat]] print ads of the 1940s, and later, with the early television exposure of gimmicky wrestlers such as [[Gorgeous George]].<ref>[http://deniskitchen.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&Category_Code=bios.mcgoon Earthquake McGoon \"biography\" at deniskitchen.com]</ref> Earthquake is the nastiest resident of neighboring Skonk Hollow \u2014 a nightmarish, notoriously lawless community where no sane Dogpatcher dares set foot. The randy McGoon often attempted to walk Daisy Mae home \"Skonk Hollow style\" \u2014 the lascivious implications of which are never made specific.\n* '''The ''(shudder!)'' Scraggs:''' Hulking, leering, gap-toothed twin miscreants '''Lem and Luke''' and their needlessly proud pappy, '''Romeo'''. Apelike and gleefully homicidal, the impossibly evil Scraggs were officially declared inhuman by an act of [[United States Congress|Congress]]. The Scraggs were so awful, they burned down orphanages just to have light to read by (although the joke was on them when they remembered they couldn't read!) Distant kinfolk of Daisy Mae, they carried on a blood [[feud]] with the Yokums throughout the run of the strip-in their first introduction after being run out of a Kentucky county at gunpoint, they tried to kill Li'l Abner but were beaten up by both Abner and his mother Mammy Yokum; Mammy then banished the Scraggs to Skonk Hollow with a dividing line between  Skonk Hollow and Dogpatch \u2014 with the understanding that although the Scraggs couldn't cross the line, any member of Dogpatch who did cross was prey to the Scraggs! (As did happen to Rotten Ralphie). A long-lost kid sister named '''\"*@!!*!\"-Belle Scragg''' briefly joined the clan in 1947. Fetchingly-attired in a prison-striped [[reform school]] miniskirt, \"*@!!*!\"-Belle was outwardly attractive but just as rotten as her siblings on the inside. Her censored first name was an [[Profanity|expletive]], compelling everyone who addressed her to apologize profusely afterwards.\n* '''Nightmare Alice:''' Dogpatch's own \"conjurin' woman,\" a hideous, cackling crone who practiced [[Louisiana Voodoo]] and [[black magic]]. Capp named her after the carnival-themed horror film, ''[[Nightmare Alley (1947 film)|Nightmare Alley]]'' (1947). Alice employs [[witchcraft]] to \"whomp up\" ghosts and monsters to do her bidding. She was occasionally assisted by '''Doctor Babaloo''', a [[witch doctor]] of the [[Belgian Congo]], as well as her demon-child niece '''Scary Lou''', who specializes in vexing [[voodoo doll]]s that resemble Li'l Abner.\n* '''Ole Man Mose:''' The mysterious Mose was reportedly hundreds of \"y'ars\" old, and lived like a hermit in a cave atop a mountain. (He obstinately refused to \"kick the bucket,\" which was conveniently positioned just outside his cave door.) His wisdom is absolute (\"Ole Man Mose \u2014 ''he knows!\"''), and his sought-after annual Sadie Hawkins Day predictions \u2014 though frustratingly cryptic and infuriatingly misleading \u2014 are nonetheless 100% accurate.\n* '''Evil Eye Fleagle:''' Fleagle has a unique and terrifying skill \u2014 the [[evil eye]]. An ordinary \"whammy,\" as he called it, could stop a charging bull in its tracks. A \"double whammy\" could fell a skyscraper, leaving Fleagle exhausted. His dreaded \"triple whammy\" could melt a battleship \u2014 but would practically kill Fleagle in the process.<ref>[http://deniskitchen.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&Category_Code=bios.evil.eye Evil-Eye Fleegle \"biography\" at deniskitchen.com]</ref> The zoot suit-clad Fleagle was a native of [[Brooklyn]], and his burlesque New York accent was unmistakable \u2014 especially when addressing his \"goil,\" the [[zaftig]] '''Shoiley'''. Fleagle was so popular, licensed plastic replicas of Fleagle's face were produced in the 1950s, to be worn like lapel pins. Battery-operated, the wearer could pull a string and produce a flashing light bulb \"whammy.\" Fleagle was reportedly based on a real-life character, a [[Damon Runyon|Runyonesque]] local [[boxing]] trainer and hanger-on named Benjamin \"Evil Eye\" Finkle. Finkle and his famous \"hex\" were a ringside fixture in New York boxing circles during the 1930s and '40s. Fleagle was vividly portrayed by [[character actor]] [[Al Nesor]] in the aforementioned stage play and film.\n* '''J. Roaringham Fatback:''' The self-styled \"Pork King\" was a greedy, gluttonous, unscrupulous business tycoon. Incensed to find that Dogpatch cast a shadow on his breakfast egg, he had Dogpatch moved \u2014 instead of the egg. The bloated, porcine Fatback is, quite literally, a corporate swine.\n* '''Gat Garson:''' Li'l Abner's ''[[doppelg\u00e4nger]]'' \u2014 a murderous racketeer, with a predilection for Daisy Mae.\n* '''Aunt Bessie:''' Mammy's socialite kid sister, the Duchess of Bopshire, was the \"white sheep\" of the family. Bessie's string of marriages into [[Boston]] and [[Park Avenue (Manhattan)|Park Avenue]] [[aristocracy]] left her a class-conscious, condescending snob. Her status-seeking crusade to makeover Abner and marry him off into [[upper class|high society]] was doomed to failure, however. Aunt Bessie virtually disappeared from the strip after Abner and Daisy Mae's marriage in 1952.\n* '''Big Barnsmell:''' The lonely \"inside man\" at the \"Skonk Works\" \u2014 a dilapidated factory located on the remote outskirts of Dogpatch. Scores of locals are done in yearly by the toxic fumes of concentrated \"skonk oil,\" which is brewed and barreled daily by Barnsmell and his cousin (\"outside man\" '''Barney Barnsmell''') by grinding dead [[skunk]]s and worn shoes into a smoldering [[still]], for some unspecified purpose. His job played havoc with his social life (\"He has an air about him,\" as Dogpatchers tactfully put it), and the name of his famous facility entered the modern lexicon via the [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] [[Skunk Works]] project.\n* '''Soft-Hearted John:''' Dogpatch's impossibly mercenary, thoroughly blackhearted grocer, the ironically named Soft-Hearted John gleefully swindled and starved his clientele \u2014 and looked disturbingly satanic to boot. He had an idiot of a nephew who sometimes ran the store in his stead, aptly named '''Soft-Headed John'''.\n* '''Smilin' Zack:''' Cadaverous, outwardly peaceable mountaineer with a menacing grin and an even more menacing shotgun. He preferred things \"quiet.\" (''Real'' quiet, that is \u2014 not breathing or anything.) Zack's moniker was a take-off on another comic strip, ''[[The Adventures of Smilin' Jack]]'' by [[Zack Mosley]].\n* '''Dr. Killmare:''' The local Dogpatch physician, who just happened to be a horse doctor. His name was a pun on movie, radio and TV's ''[[Dr. Kildare]]'' series.\n* '''Cap'n Eddie Ricketyback:''' Decrepit [[World War I]] [[aviator]] and proprietor/sole operator of the even more decrepit Dogpatch Airlines. Cap'n Eddie's name was a spoof of decorated World War I flying ace, [[Eddie Rickenbacker]]. In 1970, Cap'n Eddie and his firm Trans-Dogpatch Airlines were awarded the West Berlin Route by his old rival Count Felix Von Holenhedt.\n* '''Count Felix Von Holenhedt:''' German flying ace who in 1970 (age 89) was appointed as West German Civil Aviation Chief. He was never photographed without his World War I spiked helmet on his head. He wore it to cover the hole in his head that had been caused by being shot \"clean through th' haid, in a dogfight over Flanders Field in 1918\" by Cap'n Eddie Ricketyback. Nonetheless the two old enemies eventually patched things up; Cap'n Ricketyback even convinced the Count to settle in the States. \"Jah!\" cried the Count. \"I got a cousin in Milvaukee!\"\n* '''Weakeyes Yokum:''' Before [[Mister Magoo]] there was Dogpatch's own Cousin Weakeyes, who would tragically mistake grizzly bears for romantically-inclined \"rich gals\" in fur coats, and end a sequence by characteristically walking off a cliff.\n* '''Young Eddie McSkonk and U.S. Mule:''' Ancient, creaky, white-bearded Dogpatch postmaster and his hoary jackass mount. They were usually too feeble to handle the sacks of timeworn, cobweb-covered letters marked \"Rush\" at the Dogpatch Express Post Office.\n* '''J. Colossal McGenius:''' The brilliant marketing consultant and \"idea man\" who charged $10,000 per word for his sought-after business advice. McGenius was given to telling long-winded jokes with forgotten punch lines, however \u2014 as well as spells of hiccups and belches which, at ten grand a pop, usually [[bankruptcy|bankrupted]] his unfortunate clients. (He had a regrettable fondness for gassy soft drinks like \"Burpsi-Booma\" and \"Eleven Urp.\") He was aided by his lovely and meticulously efficient secretary, '''Miss Pennypacker'''.\n* '''Silent Yokum:''' Prudent Cousin Silent never utters a word unless it's absolutely, ''vitally'' important. Consequently, he hadn't spoken in 40 years. The arrival of Silent's grim visage in Dogpatch signaled earthshaking news on the horizon. Capp would milk reader suspense by having Silent \"warm up\" his rusty, creaking jaw muscles for a few days, before the momentous pronouncement.\n* '''Happy Vermin:''' The \"world's smartest cartoonist\" \u2014 a caricature of [[Ham Fisher]] \u2014 who hired Li'l Abner to draw his comic strip for him in a dimly-lit closet. Instead of using Vermin's tired characters, Abner had inventively peopled the strip with hillbillies. A bighearted Vermin told his slaving assistant: \"I'm proud of having created these characters!! They'll make millions for me!! And if they do \u2014 I'll get ''you'' a new light bulb!!\"\n* '''Big Stanislouse;''' aka '''Big Julius:''' Stanislouse was a brutal gangster with a childish fondness for kiddie TV superheroes (like \"Chickensouperman\" and \"Milton the Masked Martian\"). Part of a virtual goon squad of comic mobsters that inhabited ''Li'l Abner'' and ''Fearless Fosdick'', the oafish Stanislouse alternated with other all-purpose underworld thugs, including \"the Boys from the Syndicate\" \u2014 Capp's [[euphemism]] for [[Mafia|The Mob]].\n* '''The Square-Eyes Family:''' Mammy's revelatory encounter with these unpopular Dogpatch outcasts first appeared in 1956. The [[fable]]-like story was really a thinly-veiled appeal for racial tolerance. It was later issued as an educational comic book \u2014 called ''Mammy Yokum and the Great Dogpatch Mystery!'' \u2014 by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] of [[B'nai B'rith]].\n* '''Appassionata Von Climax:''' One of a series of predatory, sexually aggressive sirens who pursued Li'l Abner prior to his marriage, and even afterwards, much to the consternation of Daisy Mae. Joining a long list of dishy ''[[femmes fatales]]'' and spoiled debutantes that included '''Gloria Van Welbilt, Moonlight Sonata, Mimi Van Pett''' and '''\"The Tigress\"'''; Appassionata was memorably portrayed by both [[Tina Louise]] (onstage) and [[Stella Stevens]] (on film). Capp always wondered how he ever got her suggestive name past the censors.\n* '''Tenderleif Ericson:''' Discovered frozen in the mud where her [[Viking]] ship sank in 1047, Tenderleif was [[Leif Ericson]]'s beautiful, teenaged kid sister (complete with [[breastplate]] [[armor]], Viking helmet and burlesque [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] accent). As soon as she saw Li'l Abner, however, she started warming up and breathing hard. \"She's seventeen y'ars old,\" explains Mammy, \"and she hain't had a date fo' nine hunnerd y'ars!\"\n* '''Princess Minihahaskirt:''' Decades before [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]'', the sexiest cartoon Indian princesses could be found in ''Li'l Abner''. The latest in a series of lovely native maidens who enticed the normally stoic Lonesome Polecat, the list also included '''Minnie Mustache, Raving Dove, Little Turkey Wing''' and '''Princess Two Feathers'''.\n* '''Liddle Noodnik:''' A typically miserable resident of perpetually frozen [[Lower Slobbovia]], naked local waif Liddle Noodnik was usually employed to recite a farcical poem of greeting to visiting dignitaries, or sing the absurd Slobbovian [[national anthem]] (see \"setting and fictitious locales\"). Like many terms in ''Li'l Abner'', Noodnik's name was derived from [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]. ''[[List of English words of Yiddish origin|Nudnik]]'' is a slang term for a bothersome person or pest.\n* '''Pantless Perkins:''' A very late addition to the strip, Capp introduced Honest Abe's brainy, ragamuffin pal Pantless Perkins in a series of kid-themed stories in the seventies, probably to compete with ''[[Peanuts (comic strip)|Peanuts]]''. Poor Pantless didn't own a single pair of trousers. He wore an over-length turtleneck sweater to hide the fact \u2014 much to his embarrassment. In one storyline {Feb/March 1972}the nearest he ever got a pair of pants was when he helps Honest Abe find a long lost love of a millionaire in return for a pair of pants. Unfortunately the prospective groom drops dead after tasting the terrible cooking of his bride to be \u2014 and Pantless remains pantless!\n* '''Rotten Ralphie:''' The kiddie version of Earthquake McGoon, Ralphie lived up to his name \u2014 he was the perfectly rotten Dogpatch neighborhood bully. Exceedingly large for his age, Ralphie always wore a cowboy outfit that was several sizes too small. In one storyline after Ralphie beats up every boy in Dogpatch at the same time, he himself is beaten up when Pantless Perkins and Honest Abe trick Ralphie into getting into a fight with the Scragg boys of Skonk Hollow!\n* '''Marcia Perkins:''' Innocent, outwardly normal teenager whose lips give off 451&nbsp;\u00b0F of [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic heat]], frying the brain of any boy who kisses her. Declared a walking health hazard, poor Marcia must wear a public warning sign (\"Do Not Kiss This Girl, by Order of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Dept. of Health, Education and Welfare]]\"). Her notoriety precedes her everywhere except Dogpatch \u2014 where she meets and falls for Tiny Yokum.\n* '''Bet-a-Million Bashby:''' Bashby amassed his colossal fortune by following one simple rule: Always bet on a sure thing, and always bet with a fool. He hadn't reckoned on fool's luck, however. All through the years Bashby bet on sure things, and all through the years Abner won.\n* '''The Widder Fruitful:''' Another iconic Dogpatch \"regular,\" often glimpsed in passing or featured in crowd scenes. The ample, fertile widow invariably held three or four naked newborns under each arm, always carried backside forward, with a healthy brood of earlier offspring following in her wake.\n* '''Loverboynik:''' In 1954, Capp sent a letter to [[Liberace]] addressing his intention to spoof him in ''Li'l Abner'' as \"Liverachy.\" Liberace had his lawyers threaten to sue. Capp went ahead anyway, with a significant name change. Billed as the \"Sweetheart of the Piano,\" Loverboynik is a blonde \"dimpled darling\" pianist and TV heartthrob. According to Capp, Liberace was \"cut to the quick\" when the parody appeared. Capp insisted that Loverboynik was ''not'' Liberace because Loverboynik \"could play the piano rather decently and rarely wore black lace underwear.\"<ref>\"The Comic Page Is the Last Refuge of Classic Art,\" ''NEMO'' #18, April 1986, pg. 16</ref>\n* '''Rock Hustler:''' Unscrupulous publicity agent-turned-marketing mogul. He masterminds an ad campaign promoting the miracle diet food \"Mockaroni,\" carefully neglecting to disclose that it's both addictive and lethal. \"The more you crave, the more you eat. The more you eat, the thinner you get \u2014 until you ''(shudder!)'' float away...\"\n* '''Dumpington Van Lump:''' The bloated, almost [[catatonic]] heir to the Van Lump fortune, Dumpington can only utter one syllable (\"Urp!\") ...until he sets sight on Daisy Mae. A somewhat subhuman fiend, his favorite book is the disturbingly-titled \"How to Make Lampshades Out of Your Friends.\" Capp chose the Dumpington sequence to illustrate his lesson on continuity storytelling in the ''Famous Artists Cartoon Course''.\n* '''Sam the Centaur:''' A \"mythical critter\" with a classic, chiseled profile and [[Apollo]]-like blonde mane, Sam is a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[centaur]] who occasionally roams the mountains of Dogpatch instead of the mountains of [[Thessaly]]. Available Jones, \"th' most book-educated varmint in Dogpatch,\" pronounces: \"He ''hain't'' real!\"\n* '''Jubilation T. Cornpone:''' Dogpatch's founder and most famous son, memorialized by a town statue, is [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] General Jubilation T. Cornpone \u2014 renowned for \"Cornpone's Retreat,\" \"Cornpone's Disaster,\" \"Cornpone's Stupidity,\" \"Cornpone's Misjudgment,\" \"Cornpone's Hoolmiliation\" and \"Cornpone's Final Mistake\". Cornpone was such a disastrously incompetent military leader that he came to be considered an important asset of the ''opposing side''. According to the stage play, the statue was commissioned by a grateful President [[Abraham Lincoln]]! Cornpone's only victories were posthumous \u2014 in one storyline, the General's statue is filled with Kickapoo Joy juice, which brings it to \"life.\" It then goes on a rampage, beheading all the statues of [[Union (American Civil War)|Union Army]] generals. As the U.S. Army can't destroy it \u2014 since it's a [[National Monument]] \u2014 Kickapoo Joy Juice is poured into a Union statue which results in both statutes charging one another. When the smoke clears, the animated statues have annihilated each other. At Mammy Yokum's urging the statue pieces are put together with glue. The hapless general is really best known for being the namesake of the rousing musical number (a \"showstopper\") in the popular ''[[Li'l Abner (musical)|Li'l Abner]]'' musical, as sung by Marryin' Sam and chorus.\n* '''Jubilation T. Cornpone Jr:''' son of General Cornpone; formerly \"commanded\" army mules; became Commander of all U.N. Forces against Invaders from Outer Space \u2014 despite being described as the most incompetent general of all time \u2014 he was given the job because no other General would take it!  {Feb 1959}; fell in love with big eyes \"Princess Pocahauntingeyes\" and lived with her in the land above the Dogpatch via the \"Trashbean stalk\"; henpecked Cornpone admits to Honest Abe however that all is not bliss \u2014 his \"Big eyed\" wife eyes have got smaller and her mouth is bigger! {Nov 20, 1971}\n* '''Romeo McHaystack:''' A would be [[Don Juan]] of Pineapple Junction whose attempts at romancing women are frustrated because the Civic Improvement League tattooed a warning about him on his forehead. Discouraged, he suddenly decides to romance Dogpatch women when he discovers that because atomic waste is suspended above Dogpatch, Dogpatch is permanently in darkness!<ref>[http://www.gocomics.com/lil-abner/2013/09/01 Go Comics]</ref> (The waste was dropped on Dogpatch because it was thought nobody lived there since no [[income tax]]es had been filed there since 1776!)\n* '''Sadie Hawkins:''' In the early days of Dogpatch, Sadie Hawkins was \"the homeliest gal in them hills\" who grew frantic waiting for suitors to come a-courtin'. Her father '''Hekzebiah Hawkins''', a prominent Dogpatch resident, grew even more frantic \u2014 about Sadie living at home for the rest of his life. So he decreed the first annual [[Sadie Hawkins Day]], a foot race in which all the unmarried women pursued the town's bachelors, with matrimony as the consequence.<ref>[http://deniskitchen.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&Category_Code=bios.evil.eye Sadie Hawkins \"biography\" at deniskitchen.com]</ref> A pseudo-holiday entirely created in the strip, it's still frequently observed today in the form of [[Sadie Hawkins dance]]s, to which it is customary for women to ask men and at which women approach (or chase after) men.\n* '''Lena the Hyena:''' A hideous Lower Slobbovian gal, referred to but initially unseen or only glimpsed from the neck down in ''Li'l Abner.'' Lena was so ugly that anyone who saw her was immediately driven mad. No sane person, therefore, could tell you what she looked like. After weeks of teasing his readers by hiding Lena's face behind \"censored\" stickers and strategically placed dialogue balloons, Capp invited fans to draw Lena in a famous nationwide contest in 1946. Lena was ultimately revealed in the harrowing winning entry (as judged by [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Boris Karloff]] and [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]]) drawn by noted cartoonist [[Basil Wolverton]].\n* '''Joanie Phoanie:''' An unabashed [[Communism|Communist]] radical and agitator, who sang revolutionary songs of [[class conflict|class warfare]] (with burlesque titles like \"[[Molotov cocktail|Molotov]] [[Cocktails for Two]]\") \u2014 while hypocritically traveling via [[limousine]] and charging outrageous concert appearance fees to impoverished orphans. Joanie was Capp's notorious parody of protest singer/songwriter [[Joan Baez]]. The character caused a storm of controversy in 1966, and many newspapers would only run [[censorship|censored]] versions of the strips. Baez took Capp's implicit satire to heart, however, as she would admit years later in her autobiography: \"Mr Capp confused me considerably. I'm sorry he's not alive to read this, it would make him chuckle,\" (from ''And a Voice to Sing With: A Memoir'', 1987).\n* '''S.W.I.N.E.:''' Capp used ''Li'l Abner'' to satirize current events, fads, and ephemeral popular culture (such as [[zoot suit]]s in \"Zoot Suit Yokum,\" 1943). Beginning in the mid-1960s, the strip became a forum for Capp's increasingly [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] political views. Capp, who lived in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], just a stone's throw from [[Harvard University|Harvard]], satirized campus radicals, militant student political groups and [[hippie]]s during the [[Vietnam War]] [[Opposition to the US involvement in the Vietnam War|protest era]]. The [[Youth International Party]] (YIP) and [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS) emerged in ''Li'l Abner'' as S.W.I.N.E. (Students Wildly Indignant about Nearly Everything!)\n* Al Capp claimed that he always strove to give incidental characters in ''Li'l Abner'' names that would render all further description unnecessary.  In that spirit, the following list of recurring semi-regulars (and a few one-shots) are unreferenced: '''Tobacco Rhoda, Joan L. Sullivan, Romeo McHaystack, Hamfat Gooch, Global McBlimp, Concertino Constipato, Jinx Rasputinburg, J. Sweetbody Goodpants, Reactionary J. Repugnant, B. Fowler McNest, Fleabrain, Stubborn P. Tolliver, Idiot J. Tolliver, Battling McNoodnik, Mayor Dan'l Dawgmeat, Slobberlips McJab, One-Fault Jones, Swami Riva, Olman Riva, Sir Orble Gasse-Payne, Black Rufe, Mickey Looney, \"Ironpants\" Bailey, Henry Cabbage Cod, Flash Boredom, Priceless and Liceless, Hopeless and Soapless, Disgustin' Jones, Skelton McCloset, Hawg McCall, \"Good old\" Bedly Damp''', and a host of others.\n\n===''Fearless Fosdick''===\n{{Main|Fearless Fosdick}}\n''Li'l Abner'' also featured a comic strip-within-the-strip: ''[[Fearless Fosdick]]'' was a parody of [[Chester Gould]]'s plainclothes detective, ''[[Dick Tracy]]''. It first appeared in 1942, and proved so popular that it ran intermittently in ''Li'l Abner'' over the next 35 years. Gould was also personally parodied in the series as cartoonist '''Lester Gooch''' \u2014 the diminutive, much-harassed and occasionally deranged \"creator\" of ''Fearless Fosdick''. The style of the ''Fosdick'' sequences closely mimicked ''Tracy'', including the urban setting, the outrageous villains, the galloping mortality rate, the crosshatched shadows, the lettering style \u2014 even Gould's familiar signature was parodied in ''Fearless Fosdick''.  Fosdick battled a succession of archenemies with absurdly unlikely names like '''Rattop, Anyface, Bombface, Boldfinger, the Atom Bum, the Chippendale Chair,''' and '''Sidney the Crooked Parrot''', as well as his own criminal mastermind father, '''\"Fearful\" Fosdick''' (aka \"The Original\"). The razor-jawed title character (Li'l Abner's \"ideel\") was perpetually ventilated by flying bullets until he resembled a slice of Swiss cheese.<ref>[http://deniskitchen.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&Category_Code=bios.fosdick Fearless Fosdick \"biography\" at deniskitchen.com]</ref> The impervious Fosdick considered the gaping, smoking holes \"mere scratches,\" however, and always reported back in one piece to his corrupt superior '''The Chief''' for duty the next day.\n\nBesides being fearless, Fosdick was \"pure, underpaid and purposeful,\" according to his creator. He also had notoriously bad aim \u2014 often leaving a trail of [[collateral damage]] (in the form of bullet-riddled pedestrians) in his wake. \"When Fosdick is after a lawbreaker, there is no escape for the miscreant,\" Capp wrote in 1956. \"There is, however, a fighting chance to escape for hundreds of innocent bystanders who happen to be in the neighborhood \u2014 but ''only'' a fighting chance. Fosdick's duty, as he sees it, is not so much to maintain safety as to destroy crime, and it's too much to ask any law-enforcement officer to do both, I suppose.\" Fosdick lived in squalor at the dilapidated boarding house run by his mercenary landlady, '''Mrs. Flintnose'''. He never married his own long-suffering fianc\u00e9e '''Prudence ''(ugh!)'' Pimpleton''' (they've been engaged for 17 years), but Fosdick was directly responsible for the unwitting marriage of his biggest fan, Li'l Abner to Daisy Mae in 1952. The bumbling detective became the star of his own [[NBC-TV]] puppet show that same year. Fosdick also achieved considerable exposure as the long-running advertising spokesman for Wildroot Cream-Oil, a popular men's hair product of the postwar period.\n\n==Setting and fictitious locales==\nAlthough ostensibly set in the Kentucky mountains, situations often took the characters to different destinations \u2014 including New York City, Washington, D.C., Hollywood, the [[Amazon rainforest|South American Amazon]], tropical islands, the Moon, Mars, etc. \u2014 as well as some purely fanciful worlds of Capp's imagination:\n\n===Dogpatch===\nExceeding every [[burlesque]] stereotype of [[Appalachia]], the impoverished backwater of [[Dogpatch]] consisted mostly of hopelessly ramshackle log cabins, \"tarnip\" fields, pine trees and \"hawg\" wallows. Most Dogpatchers were shiftless and ignorant; the remainder were scoundrels and thieves. The menfolk were too lazy to work, yet Dogpatch gals were desperate enough to chase them (see [[Sadie Hawkins Day]]). Those who farmed their turnip fields watched \"turnip termites\" swarm by the billions every year, locust-like, to devour Dogpatch's only crop (along with their homes, their livestock and all their clothing).\n\nThe local geography was fluid and vividly complex; Capp continually changed it to suit either his whims or the current storyline. Natural landmarks included (at various times) Teeterin' Rock, Onneccessary Mountain, Bottomless Canyon, and Kissin' Rock (handy to Suicide Cliff). Local attractions that reappeared in the strip included the West Po'k Chop Railroad; the \"Skonk Works\", a dilapidated factory located on the remote outskirts of Dogpatch; and the General Jubilation T. Cornpone memorial statue.\n\nIn one storyline Dogpatch's \"Cannonball Express\" train, after 1,563 tries, finally delivers its \"cargo\" to Dogpatch citizens \u2014 on Oct 12, 1946! Receiving a 13-year stack of newspapers, Li'l Abner's family realizes that the [[Great Depression]] is on and that banks should close; they race to take their money out of the bank \u2014 before realizing they have no money in the bank! Other news is the inauguration of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] as President on March 4, 1933 (although Mammy Yokam thinks the President is [[Teddy Roosevelt]]) and a picture of Germany's \"new leader\" [[Adolf Hitler]] who claims to love peace while reviewing 20,000 new planes (April 21, 1933); Mammy doesn't trust Hitler but Li'l Abner and Pappy think Hitler is a fine feller \u2014 since Senator Fogbound (Phogbound) says so!\n\nIn the midst of the Great Depression, the hardscrabble residents of lowly Dogpatch allowed suffering Americans to laugh at yokels even worse off than themselves.<ref>[http://deniskitchen.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&Category_Code=bios.dogpatch Dogpatch page at deniskitchen.com]</ref> In Al Capp's own words, Dogpatch was \"an average stone-age community nestled in a bleak valley, between two cheap and uninteresting hills somewhere.\" Early in the continuity Capp a few times referred to Dogpatch being in [[Kentucky]], but he was careful afterwards to keep its location generic, probably to avoid cancellations from offended Kentucky newspapers. From then on, he referred to it as Dogpatch, USA, and did not give any specific location as to exactly where it was supposed to be located. Humorously enough, many states tried to claim ownership to the little town (Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, etc.), yet Capp would not budge. He left it at Dogpatch USA so there would be no headaches and problems. Like the [[Coconino County, Arizona|Coconino County]] depicted in [[George Herriman]]'s ''[[Krazy Kat]]'' and the [[Okefenokee Swamp]] of [[Walt Kelly]]'s ''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]'', Dogpatch's distinctive cartoon landscape became as identified with the strip as any of its characters. Later, Capp licensed and was part-owner of an {{convert|800|acre|km2|adj=on}} $35 million [[theme park]] called [[Dogpatch USA]] near [[Harrison, Arkansas]].\n\n===Lower Slobbovia===\nAs utterly wretched as existence was in Dogpatch, there was one place even worse. Frigid, faraway [[Lower Slobbovia]] was fashioned as a pointedly political satire of backward nations and foreign diplomacy, and remains a contemporary reference.<ref>{{cite news|last=Baker |first=Russell |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/13/opinion/observer-hillary-in-lower-slobbovia.html |title=Hillary in Lower Slobbovia \u2014 '&#39;NY Times'&#39; Jan. 13, 1996 |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1996-01-13 |accessdate=2009-08-29}}</ref> Its hapless residents were perpetually waist-deep in several feet of snow, and icicles hung from almost every frostbitten nose.<ref>[http://deniskitchen.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&Category_Code=bios.slobbovia Lower Slobbovia page at deniskitchen.com]</ref> The favorite dish of the starving natives was raw [[polar bear]] (and vice versa). Lower Slobbovians spoke with burlesque [[pidgin]]-Russian accents; the miserable frozen wasteland of Capp's invention abounded in incongruous [[Yiddish]] humor.\n\nLower Slobbovia and Dogpatch are both comic examples of modern [[dystopian]] satire. Conceptually based on [[Siberia]], or perhaps specifically on [[Birobidzhan]], Capp's icy hellhole made its first appearance in ''Li'l Abner'' in April 1946. Ruled by '''Good King Nogoodnik''' (sometimes known as '''King Stubbornovsky the Last'''), the Slobbovian politicians were even more corrupt than their Dogpatch counterparts. Their monetary unit was the \"rasbucknik,\" of which one was worth nothing and a large quantity was worth a lot less, due to the trouble of carrying them around. The local children were read harrowing tales from \"Ice-sop's Fables,\" which were parodies of classic [[Aesop Fables]], but with a darkly sardonic bent (and titles like \"Coldilocks and the Three Bares\").{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Other fictional locales===\nOther fictional locales included Skonk Hollow, El Passionato, Kigmyland, the Republic of Crumbumbo, Lo Kunning, Faminostan, Planets Pincus Number 2 and 7, Pineapple Junction and, most notably, the Valley of the Shmoon.\n\n==Shmoos and other mythic creatures==\n{{Main|Shmoo}}{{Tone|section|date=October 2017}}\n'''Shmoos''', introduced in 1948, were fabulous creatures that bred exponentially, consumed nothing, and eagerly provided everything that humankind could wish for. Besides producing both milk (bottled, grade A) and eggs (neatly packaged), they tasted like pork when roasted, chicken when fried, and steak when broiled. [[Irony|Ironically]], the shmoo's generous nature and incredible usefulness made it a threat to capitalism, to [[western culture|western society]] and perhaps to civilization itself.<ref>[http://deniskitchen.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&Category_Code=bios.shmoo The Shmoo \"biography\" at deniskitchen.com]</ref> ''Li'l Abner'' featured a whole menagerie of [[allegorical]] animals over the years \u2014 each one was designed to satirically showcase another disturbing aspect of [[human nature]]. They included:\n\n* '''Kigmies''' \u2014 [[Sadomasochism|Masochistic]], aboriginal creatures who loved to be kicked, thereby satisfying all human aggression, up to a point, after which they went on a rampage of retaliation. (The Kigmy story was originally fashioned as a [[metaphor]] for racial and religious oppression. Capp's surviving preliminary sketches of the kigmies make this apparent, as detailed in the introductory notes to ''Li'l Abner Dailies 1949: Volume 15'', Kitchen Sink Press, 1992).\n* '''The Bald Iggle''' \u2014 A cute little wide-eyed, guileless creature whose soulful gaze compelled everyone to involuntarily tell the truth \u2014 including lawyers, politicians, fishermen, advertisers, husbands, wives and used car salesmen. The Iggle was officially declared a public menace by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] (\"The life it ruins may be your own!\"), and ultimately hunted down, confiscated and exterminated.\n* '''Nogoodniks''' \u2014 or ''bad'' shmoos.<ref>[http://scoop.diamondgalleries.com/public/default.asp?t=1&m=1&c=34&s=264&ai=41615&arch=y&ssd=8/24/2002%2012:01:00%20PM ''Bad Shmoos'' from the Scoop Archive \u2014 8/24/2002]</ref> Nogoodniks were a \"sickly shade of green,\" had \"li'l red eyes, sharp yaller teeth, an' a dirty look,\" and were the sworn enemies of \"hoomanity.\" Frequently sporting [[5 o'clock shadow]]s, eye patches, scars, fangs and other ruffian attributes \u2014 they devoured \"good\" shmoos, and wreaked havoc on Dogpatch. They are finally defeated when they get subjected to [[George Jessel (actor)|George Jessel]]'s recording of [[Paul Whiteman]]'s \"Wagon Wheels,\" a sound so excruciating that it kills them instantly. (Similar plot devices were used in the 1978 ''[[Attack of the Killer Tomatoes]]'' and 1996 ''[[Mars Attacks!]]''.)\n* '''Shminfants''' \u2014 Modified baby shmoos, which looked like human babies but were eternally young, came in a variety of different \"colors,\" and never needed changing.\n* '''Shtoonks''' \u2014 Imported from the Slobbovian embassy, Shtoonks were mean-spirited, sharp-toothed, hairy, flying creatures which were \"not only sneaky, smelly and surly, but \u2014 yak! yak! \u2014 just try to eat one!!\" Shtoonks had only one useful trait: they loved human misery so much they actually enjoyed bringing bad news. They temporarily replaced [[postage stamps]] by delivering bills and other bad news for free.\n* '''Mimikniks''' \u2014 Obsessive Slobbovian songbirds who sing like anyone they have ever heard. (Those who have heard [[Maria Callas]] are valued. Those who have heard George Jessel are shot.) The only song they know the words to is ''[[Short'nin' Bread]]'', however, due to the fact that there was only one record in Lower Slobbovia.\n* '''The Money Ha-Ha''' \u2014 An alien creature from \"Planet Pincus No. 2,\" with ears shaped like taxi horns. It laid U.S. currency in place of eggs.\n* '''Turnip Termites''' \u2014 Looking like a cross between a [[locust]] and a [[piranha]], billions of these insatiable pests swarm once a year to their ancient feeding ground, Dogpatch.\n* '''Shminks''' \u2014 Valued for making \"shmink coats.\" They can ''only'' be captured by braining them with a kitchen door.\n* '''Pincushions''' \u2014 Alien beings from \"Planet Pincus No. 7.\" Like the earlier '''Moon Critters''', they looked like flying sausages with pinwheels on their posteriors.\n* '''Abominable Snow-Hams''' \u2014 Delectable but intelligent and sensitive beings, presenting Tiny Yokum with an ethical dilemma: if eating one constitutes [[cannibalism]].\n* '''The Slobbovian Amp-Eater''' \u2014 This luminous beast consumed electric currents; a walking [[energy crisis]].\n* '''Bashful Bulganiks''' \u2014 Timid birds that are so skittish they can not be seen by human eyes, and are thus [[theoretical]].\n* '''Stunflowers''' \u2014 Murderous, thoroughly malevolent [[anthropomorphic]] houseplants; anyone trying to pick their seeds ends up falling into Bottomless Canyon forever.\n* '''Fatoceroses''' \u2014 The ''only'' defense against a stampede of these bloated [[pachyderms]] is a steaming plate of lethally addictive \"Mockaroni.\"\n* '''Bitingales''' \u2014 Small, fiendish devil birds whose hellish bite causes unbearable heat \u2014 for 24 years.\n* '''The Slobbovian King Crab''' \u2014 A huge [[crustacean]] that only eats Slobbovian kings. Later supplemented by a marsupial called the Kingaroo, \"which only eats [Slobbovian] kings\"\n* '''The Flapaloo''' \u2014 A scrawny, prehistoric bird that lays 1,000 eggs per minute. The eggs, when dissolved, turn water into gasoline.

He constantly interspersed [[boldface]] type, and included prompt words in parentheses (''chuckle!, sob!, gasp!, shudder!, smack!, drool!, cackle!, snort!, gulp!, blush!, ugh!,'' etc.) as asides, to bolster the effect of the printed [[speech balloons]]. Almost every line was followed by ''two'' exclamation marks for added emphasis.\n\nOutside Dogpatch, characters used a variety of stock [[Vaudevillian]] dialects. [[Organized crime|Mobsters]] and criminal-types invariably spoke slangy [[Brooklynese]], and residents of Lower Slobbovia spoke pidgin-Russian, with a smattering of [[Yinglish]]. Comic dialects were also devised for offbeat British characters \u2014 like '''H'Inspector Blugstone''' of [[Scotland Yard]] (who had a [[Cockney]] accent) and '''Sir Cecil Cesspool''' (whose speech was a clipped, uppercrust [[Received Pronunciation|King's English]]). Various [[Asian people|Asian]], [[Latin Americans|Latin]], [[Native Americans in the US|Native American]] and [[ethnic groups in Europe|European]] characters spoke in a wide range of specific, broadly caricatured dialects as well. Capp has credited his inspiration for vividly stylized language to early literary influences like [[Charles Dickens]], [[Mark Twain]] and [[Damon Runyon]], as well as [[Old-time radio]] and the Burlesque stage.\n\nComics historian [[Don Markstein]] commented that Capp's \"use of language was both unique and universally appealing; and his clean, bold cartooning style provided a perfect vehicle for his creations.\"<ref name=toonopedia />\n\nThe following is a partial list of characteristic expressions that reappeared often in ''Li'l Abner:''\n* \"Natcherly!\"\n* \"Amoozin' but confoozin'!\"\n* \"Yo' big, sloppy ''beast!!\"'' (also, \"Yo' mizzable ''skonk!!\"'')\n* \"Ef Ah had mah druthers, Ah'd druther...\"\n* \"As any fool kin plainly see!\"  (Response: \"''Ah'' sees!\")\n* \"What's good for General Bullmoose is good for ''everybody!\"'' (Variant from the movie: \"...good for the USA!\")\n* \"Thar's no Jack S. like ''our'' Jack S!\"\n* \"Oh, happy day!\"\n* \"Th' ideel o' ev'ry one hunnerd percent, red-blooded American boy!\"\n* \"Ah'll ''bash'' yore ''haid'' in!!\"\n* \"Wal, fry mah hide!\"  (also, \"Wal, cuss mah bones!\")\n* \"Ah has ''spoken!\"''\n* \"Good is better than evil becuz it's ''nicer!\"''\n* \"It hain't ''hoomin'', thass whut it hain't!\"\n\n==Toppers and alternate strips==\n''Li'l Abner'' had several [[topper (comic strip)|toppers]] on the Sunday page, including<ref name=Holtz/>\n\n* ''Washable Jones'' (Feb 24 - June 9, 1935)\n* ''Advice fo' Chillun'', aka ''Advice fo' Gals'', ''Advice fo' Parents'', ''Advice fo' Yo' All'' and other titles (June 23, 1935 \u2013 Aug 15, 1943)\n* ''Small Change'', aka ''Small Fry'' (May 31, 1942 - 1944)\n\nThe Sunday page debuted six months into the run of the strip. The first topper was ''Washable Jones'', a weekly continuity about a four-year-old hillbilly boy who goes fishing and accidentally hooks a ghost, which he pulls from the water.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Schumacher |first1=Michael |last2=Kitchen |first2=Denis |title=Al Capp: A Life to the Contrary |date=2013 |publisher=Bloomsbury USA |isbn=1608196232 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/alcapplifetocont0000schu/page/79 79\u201380] |url=https://archive.org/details/alcapplifetocont0000schu/page/79 }}</ref> After four months of fantasy adventure, Capp ended the strip with Washable's mother waking him up; the story was a dream. After this, Capp simply expanded ''Li'l Abner'' by another row, and filled the rest of the space with a page-wide title panel and a small panel called ''Advice fo' Chillun''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Holtz |first1=Allan |title=Toppers: Washable Jones |url=http://strippersguide.blogspot.com/2018/02/toppers-washable-jones.html |website=Stripper's Guide |accessdate=9 July 2019}}</ref> Washable Jones later appeared in the strip in a Shmoo-related storyline in 1949, and he appeared with the Shmoos in two one-shot comics -- ''Al Capp's Shmoo in Washable Jones' Travels'' (1950, a premium for [[Oxydol]] laundry detergent) and ''Washable Jones and the Shmoo'' #1 (1953, published by the Capp-owned publisher Toby Press).\n\nAl Capp also wrote two other daily comic strips:<ref name=Holtz />\n\n* ''[[Abbie an' Slats]]'', drawn by [[Raeburn van Buren]] (July 12, 1937 - January 30, 1971)\n* ''[[Long Sam]]'', drawn by [[Bob Lubbers]] (May 31, 1954 \u2013 December 29, 1962)\n\n==Licensing, advertising and promotion==\nAl Capp was a master of the arts of marketing and [[promotion (marketing)|promotion]]. Publicity campaigns were devised to boost circulation and increase public visibility of ''Li'l Abner'', often coordinating with national magazines, radio and television. In 1946 Capp persuaded six of the most popular radio personalities (Frank Sinatra, [[Kate Smith]], [[Danny Kaye]], [[Bob Hope]], [[Fred Waring]] and [[Smilin' Jack Smith]]) to broadcast a song he'd written for Daisy Mae: ''(Li'l Abner) Don't Marry That Girl!!''<ref>''Anything Can Happen in a Comic Strip: Centennial Reflections on an American Art Form'' by M. Thomas Inge (1995) Univ. Press of Mississippi, pg. 21</ref> Other promotional tie-ins included the Lena the Hyena Contest (1946), the Name the Shmoo Contest (1949), the Nancy O. Contest (1951), the Roger the Lodger Contest (1964) and many others.\n\nCapp also excelled at product endorsement, and ''Li'l Abner'' characters were often featured in mid-century American [[advertising campaign]]s. Dogpatch characters pitched consumer products as varied as [[Grape-Nuts|Grape-Nuts cereal]], [[Kraft Foods|Kraft caramels]], [[Ivory soap]], [[Oxydol]], [[List of Procter & Gamble brands|Duz]] and [[Dreft]] detergents, [[Fruit of the Loom]], [[Orange Crush]], [[Nestl\u00e9|Nestl\u00e9's cocoa]], Cheney neckties, Pedigree pencils, Strunk chainsaws, U.S. Royal tires, [[Head & Shoulders|Head & Shoulders shampoo]] and [[General Electric]] light bulbs. There were even Dogpatch-themed family restaurants called \"Li'l Abner's\" in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], [[Morton Grove, Illinois]] and [[Seattle, Washington]].\n\nCapp himself appeared in numerous print ads. A lifelong chain-smoker, he happily plugged [[Chesterfield cigarettes]]; he appeared in Schaeffer fountain pen ads with his friends [[Milton Caniff]] and [[Walt Kelly]]; pitched the [[Famous Artists School]] (in which he had a financial interest) along with Caniff, [[Rube Goldberg]], [[Virgil Partch]], [[Willard Mullin]] and [[Whitney Darrow, Jr]]; and, though a professed [[teetotaler]], he personally endorsed [[Rheingold Beer]], among other products.\n\n* '''Cream of Wheat:''' Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, Li'l Abner was the spokesman for [[Cream of Wheat]] cereal in a long-running series of comic strip-format ads that appeared in national magazines including ''Life'', ''[[Good Housekeeping]]'', and ''[[Ladies' Home Journal]]''. The ads usually featured Daisy Mae calling for \"halp\" against a threatening menace \u2014 in the person of Earthquake McGoon or, just as often, a gorilla, grizzly bear, rampaging moose, \"Injun\" attack, or some natural disaster like an avalanche, fire or flood. Abner is dispatched to rescue her, but not before enjoying a \"dee-lishus\" enriched bowl of hot Cream of Wheat which, the reader is assured, is \"ready in just 5 minutes!\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gogd.tjs-labs.com/gallery-view?keyword=LIL*ABNER |title=Gallery of vintage ads featuring Li'l Abner as spokesman |publisher=TJS Labs Gallery of Graphic Design |date= |accessdate=2009-08-29}}</ref>\n* '''Wildroot Cream-Oil:''' ''Fearless Fosdick'' was licensed for use in an advertising campaign for Wildroot Cream-Oil, a popular men's hair tonic. Fosdick's iconic profile on tin signs and advertising displays became a prominent fixture in barbershops across America \u2014 advising readers to \"Get Wildroot Cream-Oil, Charlie!\" A series of ads appeared in newspapers, magazines and comic books featuring Fosdick's farcical battles with \"Anyface\" \u2014 a murderous master of disguise. (Anyface was ''always'' given away by his telltale [[dandruff]] and messy hair, however.)\n* '''Toys and licensed merchandise:''' Dogpatch characters were heavily licensed throughout the 1940s and 1950s: the main cast was produced as a set of six handpuppets and {{convert|14|in|mm|adj=on}} dolls by Baby Barry Toys in 1957. A 10-figure set of carnival [[chalkware]] statues of Dogpatch characters was manufactured by Artrix Products in 1951, and Topstone introduced a line of 16 rubber Halloween masks prior to 1960. Licensing would reach an apex, however, with the unexpected postwar merchandising phenomenon that followed Capp's introduction of the Shmoo. As in the strip, shmoos suddenly appeared to be everywhere in 1948 and 1949. A garment factory in [[Baltimore]] turned out a whole line of shmoo apparel \u2014 including \"Shmooveralls.\" Shmoo dolls, clocks, watches, jewelry, earmuffs, wallpaper, fishing lures, air fresheners, soap, ice cream, balloons, ashtrays, comic books, records, sheet music, toys, games, Halloween masks, salt and pepper shakers, decals, pinbacks, tumblers, coin banks, greeting cards, planters, neckties, suspenders, belts, curtains, fountain pens, and other shmoo paraphernalia were produced. In a single year, shmoo merchandise generated over $25 million in sales. Close to a hundred licensed shmoo products from 75 different manufacturers were produced, some of which sold five million units each.<ref>''Newsweek'' September 5, 1949 and ''Editor & Publisher'' July 16, 1949</ref> More recently, Dark Horse Comics issued four figures of Abner, Daisy Mae, Fosdick and the Shmoo in 2000 as part of their line of Classic Comic Characters \u2014 statues #8, 9, 17 and 31, respectively.\n* '''[[Kickapoo Joy Juice]]:''' The lethal brew known as Kickapoo Joy Juice, featured in the strip and characterized as moonshine or bootleg liquor (it could also remove hair, paint and tattoos) has been a licensed brand in real-life since 1965. The National [[NuGrape]] Company first produced the beverage, which was acquired in 1968 by the [[Moxie]] Company, and eventually the [[Monarch Beverage Company]] of Atlanta, Ga. As with [[Mountain Dew]], another euphemism for moonshine, the actual product is a soft-drink. To this day the label features Capp's characters Hairless Joe and Lonesome Polecat. Distribution currently includes the United States, Canada, Singapore, Bangladesh, China, [[Pakistan]], Malaysia, [[Mongolia]], Brunei, [[Indonesia]] and [[Thailand]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kickapoojoy.com/ |title=Official website of Kickapoo Joy Juice |publisher=Kickapoojoy.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805183841/http://www.kickapoojoy.com/ |archive-date=2009-08-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* '''Dogpatch USA:''' In 1968, an {{convert|800|acre|km2|adj=on}} $35 million [[theme park]] called [[Dogpatch USA]] opened at [[Marble Falls, Arkansas]], based on Capp's work and with his support. The gift shops sold \"hillbilly\" souvenirs like corncob pipes and moonshine jugs. In addition to the newly constructed rides and attractions, many of the buildings in the park were authentic 19th century log structures purchased by general manager James H. Schermerhorn. The logs in each building were numbered, catalogued, disassembled and reassembled at the park. Dogpatch USA was a popular attraction during the 1970s, but was closed in 1993 due to mismanagement and financial difficulties. Several attempts have been made to reopen the park but at present it lies abandoned. As of late 2005, the area once devoted to a live-action facsimile of Dogpatch (including a lifesize statue in the town square of Dogpatch \"founder\" Jubilation T. Cornpone) has been heavily stripped by vandals and souvenir hunters, and is today slowly being reclaimed by the surrounding Arkansas wilderness.  It was announced that Dogpatch will reopen as Heritage USA in October, 2018.<ref>http://www.4029tv.com/article/dogpatch-usa-site-to-reopen-as-heritage-usa/19464766</ref>\n\n==Awards and recognition==\n{{cquote|''Li'l Abner'' was a comic strip with fire in its belly and a brain in its head.|30|30| John Updike, from ''My Well-Balanced Life on a Wooden Leg'' (1991)}}\n\nFans of the strip ranged from novelist [[John Steinbeck]], who called Capp \"very possibly the best writer in the world today\" in 1953, and even earnestly recommended him for the Nobel Prize in literature \u2014 to media critic and theorist [[Marshall McLuhan]], who considered Capp \"the only robust satirical force in American life.\" [[John Updike]], calling Li'l Abner a \"hillbilly [[Candide]],\" added that the strip's \"richness of social and philosophical commentary approached the [[Voltairean]].\"<ref>[http://www.city-journal.org/2010/20_2_urb-al-capp.html Exile in Dogpatch: The Curious Neglect of Cartoonist Al Capp, ''City Journal,'' Spring 2010]</ref> Capp has been compared, at various times, to [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]], [[Jonathan Swift]], [[Lawrence Sterne]], and [[Rabelais]].<ref>Brown, Rodger, \"Dogpatch USA: The Road to Hokum\" article, ''Southern Changes: The Journal of the Southern Regional Council'', Vol. 15, No. 3, 1993, pp. 18\u201326</ref> ''Journalism Quarterly'' and ''Time'' have both called him \"the [[Mark Twain]] of cartoonists.\" [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[William F.

In 2002 the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', in a review of ''The Short Life and Happy Times of the Shmoo'', noted: \"The wry, ornery, brilliantly perceptive satirist will go down as one of the Great American Humorists.\" In ''America's Great Comic Strip Artists'' (1997), comics historian [[Rick Marschall|Richard Marschall]] analyzed the overtly [[misanthropic]] [[subtext]] of ''Li'l Abner:''\n\n{{quote|Capp was calling society absurd, not just silly; [[human nature]] not simply misguided, but irredeemably and irreducibly corrupt.

It was a commentary on human nature itself.}}\n\n''Li'l Abner'' was also the subject of the first book-length, scholarly assessment of a comic strip ever published. ''Li'l Abner: A Study in American Satire'' by [[Arthur Asa Berger]] (Twayne, 1969) contained serious analyses of Capp's narrative technique, his use of dialogue, self-caricature and grotesquerie, the strip's overall place in American satire, and the significance of social criticism and the graphic image. \"One of the few strips ever taken seriously by students of American culture,\" wrote Professor Berger, \"''Li'l Abner'' is worth studying...because of Capp's imagination and artistry, and because of the strip's very obvious social relevance.\" It was reprinted by the [[University Press of Mississippi]] in 1994.\n\nAl Capp's life and career are the subjects of a new life-sized [[mural]] commemorating his 100th birthday, displayed in downtown [[Amesbury, Massachusetts]].<ref>[http://www.newburyportnews.com/local/x1612544031/Town-to-honor-famous-cartoonist-who-lived-worked-in-Amesbury#comment-45683673 Town to Honor Famous Cartoonist Who Lived, Worked in Amesbury ''Newburyport Daily News'' April 20, 2010]</ref><ref>[http://www.boston.com/ae/theater_arts/articles/2010/05/15/amesbury_gives_lil_abner_his_due/?page=full Amesbury Gives Li'l Abner His Due ''Boston Globe'' May 15, 2010]</ref> According to the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' (as reported on May 18, 2010), the town has renamed its amphitheater in the artist's honor, and is looking to develop an Al Capp Museum.

It made its debut in ''Li'l Abner'' on November 15, 1937. Capp originally created it as a comic plot device, but in 1939, only two years after its inauguration, a double-page spread in ''Life'' proclaimed, \"On Sadie Hawkins Day Girls Chase Boys in 201 Colleges.\" By the early 1940s the comic strip event had swept the nation's imagination and acquired a life of its own. By 1952, the event was reportedly celebrated at 40,000 known venues. It became a woman-empowering rite at high schools and college campuses, long before the modern feminist movement gained prominence.\n\nOutside the comic strip, the practical basis of a [[Sadie Hawkins dance]] is simply one of gender [[role-reversal]]. Women and girls take the initiative in inviting the man or boy of their choice out on a date \u2014 almost unheard of before 1937 \u2014 typically to a dance attended by other bachelors and their assertive dates. When Capp created the event, it wasn't his intention to have it occur annually on a specific date, because it inhibited his freewheeling plotting. However, due to its enormous popularity and the numerous fan letters he received, Capp made it a tradition in the strip every November, lasting four decades. In many localities the tradition continues.\n\n===Additions to the language===\nSadie Hawkins Day and Sadie Hawkins dance are two of several terms attributed to Al Capp that have entered the English language. Others include [[:wikt:double whammy|double whammy]], [[skunk works]] and [[Lower Slobbovia]]. The term ''[[shmoo]]'' has also entered the lexicon \u2014 used in defining highly technical concepts in no fewer than ''four'' separate fields of science.<ref>[http://hoodedutilitarian.com/2010/12/strange-windows-keeping-up-with-the-goonses-part-3/ The Hooded Utilitarian: Comics\u2019 contributions to colloquial English, 18 December 2010]</ref>\n\n* In [[socioeconomics]], a \"shmoo\" refers to any generic kind of good that reproduces itself (as opposed to \"[[widget (economics)|widgets]]\" which require resources and active production).\n* In [[microbiology]], \"shmooing\" is the biological term used for the \"budding\" process in [[yeast]] reproduction. The cellular bulge produced by a [[haploid]] yeast cell towards a cell of the opposite mating type during the [[mating of yeast]] is referred to as a \"shmoo,\" due to its structural resemblance to the cartoon character.\n* In the field of [[particle physics]], \"shmoo\" refers to a high energy survey instrument \u2013 as utilized at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] for the [[Cygnus X-3]] Sky Survey performed at the LAMPF ([[Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility]]) grounds. Over one hundred white \"shmoo\" detectors were at one time sprinkled around the accelerator beamstop area and adjacent mesa to capture subatomic [[cosmic ray]] particles emitted from the [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]] [[constellation]]. The detectors housed [[scintillator]]s and [[photomultiplier]]s in an array that gave the detector its distinctive shmoo shape.\n* In [[electrical engineering]], a [[shmoo plot]] is the technical term used for the graphic pattern of test circuits. (The term is also used as a verb: to \"shmoo\" means to run the test.)\n\nCapp has also been credited with popularizing many terms, such as \"natcherly,\" [[schmooze]], [[list of American words not widely used in the United Kingdom|druthers]], and nogoodnik, neatnik, etc. (In his book ''[[The American Language]]'', [[H.L. Mencken]] credits the postwar mania for adding \"[[-nik]]\" to the ends of adjectives to create nouns as beginning \u2014 not with [[beatnik]] or [[Sputnik]], but earlier \u2014 in the pages of ''Li'l Abner''.)\n\n===Franchise ownership and creators' rights===\nIn the late 1940s, newspaper syndicates typically owned the [[copyrights]], trademarks and [[licensing]] rights to comic strips. \"Capp was an aggressive and fearless businessman,\" according to publisher [[Denis Kitchen]].  \"Nearly all comic strips, even today, are owned and controlled by syndicates, ''not'' the strips' creators. And virtually all cartoonists remain content with their diluted share of any merchandising revenue their syndicates arrange. When the starving and broke Capp first sold ''Li'l Abner'' in 1934, he gladly accepted the syndicate's standard onerous contract. But in 1947 Capp sued United Feature Syndicate for $14 million, publicly embarrassed UFS in ''Li'l Abner'', and wrested ownership and control of his creation the following year.\"<ref name=Kitchen />\n\nIn October 1947, Li'l Abner met '''Rockwell P. Squeezeblood''', head of the abusive and corrupt Squeezeblood Syndicate, a thinly veiled dig at UFS. The resulting sequence, \"Jack Jawbreaker Fights Crime!!,\" was a devastating satire of [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]]'s notorious exploitation by [[DC Comics]] over ''[[Superman]]'' (see above excerpt). It was later reprinted in ''The World of Li'l Abner'' (1953).\n\nIn 1964, Capp left United Features and took ''Li'l Abner'' to the [[Chicago Tribune New York News Syndicate]].<ref>Harvey, R.C. [http://www.tcj.com/reviews/al-capp-a-life-to-the-contrary/ \"REVIEWS: Al Capp: A Life to the Contrary,\"] ''The Comics Journal'' (MAR 14, 2013).</ref>\n\n===Integration of women in the NCS===\nAl Capp was an outspoken pioneer in favor of diversifying the [[National Cartoonists Society]] by admitting women cartoonists. The NCS had originally disallowed female members into its ranks. In 1949, when the all-male club refused membership to [[Hilda Terry]], creator of the comic strip ''[[Teena]]'', Capp temporarily resigned in protest. \"Capp had always advocated a more activist agenda for the Society, and he had begun in December 1949 to make his case in the Newsletter as well as at the meetings,\" wrote comics historian [[R. C. Harvey]].<ref>[http://classic.tcj.com/history/tales-of-the-founding-of-the-national-cartoonists-society-part-iii/ TCJ.com: \"Tales of the Founding of the National Cartoonists Society Part III\" from ''Meanwhile...: A Biography of Milton Caniff'' by R.C. Harvey, Fantagraphics (2007)]</ref> According to Tom Roberts, author of ''[[Alex Raymond]]: His Life and Art'' (2007), Capp authored a stirring [[monologue]] that was instrumental in changing the restrictive rules the following year. Hilda Terry was the first woman cartoonist to break the gender barrier when the NCS finally permitted female members in 1950.\n\n===Social commentary in comic strips===\nThrough ''Li'l Abner'', the American comic strip achieved unprecedented relevance in the postwar years, attracting new readers who were more intellectual, more informed on current events, and less likely to read the comics (according to [[Coulton Waugh]], author of ''The Comics'', 1947). \"When ''Li'l Abner'' made its debut in 1934, the vast majority of comic strips were designed chiefly to amuse or thrill their readers. Capp turned that world upside-down by routinely injecting politics and [[social commentary]] into ''Li'l Abner'',\" wrote comics historian [[Rick Marschall]] in ''America's Great Comic Strip Artists'' (1989). With adult readers far outnumbering juveniles, ''Li'l Abner'' forever cleared away the concept that humor strips were solely the domain of adolescents and children. ''Li'l Abner'' provided a whole new template for contemporary satire and personal expression in comics, paving the way for ''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]'', ''[[jules Feiffer|Feiffer]]'', ''[[Doonesbury]]'' and ''[[Mad magazine|MAD]]''.\n\n===''Mad''===\n''Fearless Fosdick'' and other ''Li'l Abner'' comic strip parodies, such as \"Jack Jawbreaker!\" (1947) and \"Little Fanny Gooney\" (1952), were almost certainly an inspiration to [[Harvey Kurtzman]] when he created his irreverent ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'', which began in 1952 as a comic book that specifically parodied other comics in the same subversive manner. By the time [[EC Comics]] published ''Mad #1'', Capp had been doing ''Fearless Fosdick'' for nearly a decade. Similarities between ''Li'l Abner'' and the early ''Mad'' include the incongruous use of mock-[[Yiddish]] slang terms, the nose-thumbing disdain for [[popular culture|pop culture]] icons, the rampant [[black humor]], the dearth of sentiment and the broad visual styling. Even the trademark comic \"signs\" that clutter the backgrounds of [[Will Elder]]'s panels had a precedent in ''Li'l Abner'', in the residence of Dogpatch ''entrepreneur'' Available Jones, though they're also reminiscent of Bill Holman's ''[[Smokey Stover]]''. Tellingly, Kurtzman resisted doing feature parodies of either ''Li'l Abner'' or ''Dick Tracy'' in the comic book ''Mad'', despite their prominence.\n\n{{cquote|Capp is one of the great unsung heroes of comics. I've never heard anyone mention this, but Capp is 100% responsible for inspiring Harvey Kurtzman to create ''Mad'' Magazine. Just look at ''Fearless Fosdick'' \u2014 a brilliant parody of ''Dick Tracy'' with all those bullet holes and stuff. Then look at ''Mad''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s \"Teddy and the Pirates,\" \"[[Superduperman!]]\" or even ''[[Little Annie Fanny]]''. Forget about it \u2014 ''slam dunk!'' Not taking anything away from Kurtzman, who was brilliant himself, but Capp was the source for that whole sense of satire in comics. Kurtzman carried that forward and passed it down to a whole new crop of cartoonists, myself included. Capp was a ''genius''. You wanna argue about it?

Both the ''Trump'' and ''Panic'' parodies were drawn by EC legend, Will Elder. In 1947, [[Will Eisner]]'s ''[[The Spirit]]'' satirized the comic strip business in general, as a denizen of Central City tries to murder cartoonist \"Al Slapp,\" creator of \"Li'l Adam.\" Capp was also caricatured as an ill-mannered, boozy cartoonist (Capp was a [[teetotaler]] in real life) named \"Hal Rapp\" in the comic strip ''[[Mary Worth]]'' by [[Allen Saunders]] and [[Ken Ernst]]. Supposedly done in retaliation for Capp's \"Mary Worm\" parody in ''Li'l Abner'' (1956), a media-fed \"feud\" commenced briefly between the rival strips. It all turned out to be a collaborative [[hoax]], however \u2014 cooked up by Capp and his longtime pal Saunders as an elaborate [[publicity stunt]].\n\n''Li'l Abner'''s success also sparked a handful of comic strip imitators. ''Jasper Jooks'' by Jess \"Baldy\" Benton (1948\u2013'49), ''Ozark Ike'' (1945\u2013'53) and ''Cotton Woods'' (1955\u2013'58), both by Ray Gotto, were clearly inspired by Capp's strip. [[Boody Rogers]]' ''Babe'' was a peculiar series of comic books about a beautiful hillbilly girl who lived with her kin in the [[Ozarks]] \u2014 with many similarities to ''Li'l Abner''. A derivative hillbilly feature called ''Looie Lazybones'', an out-and-out imitation (drawn by a young [[Frank Frazetta]]) ran in several issues of Standard's ''[[Thrilling Comics]]'' in the late 1940s. [[Charlton Comics|Charlton]] published the short-lived ''Hillbilly Comics'' by Art Gates in 1955, featuring \"Gumbo Galahad,\" who was a dead ringer for Li'l Abner, as was ''Pokey Oakey'' by Don Dean, which ran in [[MLJ]]'s ''[[Top-Notch Comics|Top-Notch Laugh]]'' and ''[[Pep Comics]]''. Later, many fans and critics saw [[Paul Henning]]'s popular TV sitcom, ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'' (1962\u2013'71) as owing much of its inspiration to ''Li'l Abner'', prompting [[Alvin Toffler]] to ask Capp about the similarities in a 1965 ''[[Playboy]]'' interview.\n\n==Popularity and production==\n[[File:Li'l Abner 3 -29-1947 Excerpt.png|thumb|350px|right|\"But, cuss it, Ah is still alive!!\" Li'l Abner, Daisy Mae, Mammy, Salomey and Pappy survive another narrow scrape in this strip excerpt from March 29, 1947.]]\n''Li'l Abner'' made its debut on August 13, 1934 in eight North American newspapers, including the ''[[New York Mirror]].'' Initially owned and syndicated through [[United Feature Syndicate]], a division of the [[E.W. Scripps Company]], it was an immediate success. According to publisher Denis Kitchen, Capp's \"hapless Dogpatchers hit a nerve in [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era America. Within three years ''Abner's'' circulation climbed to 253 newspapers, reaching over 15,000,000 readers. Before long he was in hundreds more, with a total readership exceeding 60,000,000.\"<ref name=Kitchen>{{cite web|author=Denis Kitchen Publishing Co LLC |url=http://deniskitchen.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&Category_Code=bios.capp |title=Al Capp biography by Denis Kitchen |publisher=Deniskitchen.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-29}}</ref> At its peak, the strip was read daily by 70 million Americans (when the U.S. population was only 180 million), with a circulation of more than 900 newspapers in North America and Europe.\n\nDuring the extended peak of the strip, the workload grew to include advertising, merchandising, promotional work, comic book adaptations, public service material and other specialty work \u2014 in addition to the regular six dailies and one Sunday strip per week. Capp had a platoon of assistants in later years, who worked under his direct supervision. They included Andy Amato, Harvey Curtis, Walter Johnson and, notably, a young [[Frank Frazetta]], who penciled the Sunday continuity from studio roughs from 1954 to the end of 1961 \u2014 before his fame as a fantasy artist.\n\nSensitive to his own experience working on ''[[Joe Palooka]]'', Capp frequently drew attention to his assistants in interviews and publicity pieces. A 1950 cover story in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' even included photos of two of his employees, whose roles in the production were detailed by Capp. Ironically, this highly irregular policy has led to the misconception that his strip was \"ghosted\" by other hands. The production of ''Li'l Abner'' has been well documented, however. In point of fact, Capp maintained creative control over every stage of production for virtually the entire run of the strip. Capp himself originated the stories, wrote the dialogue, designed the major characters, rough penciled the preliminary staging and action of each panel, oversaw the finished pencils, and drew and inked the faces and hands of the characters. \"He had ''the touch,''\" Frazetta said of Capp in 2008. \"He knew how to take an otherwise ordinary drawing and really make it ''pop''. I'll never knock his talent.\"<ref>Mason, Edward (ed.), ''Telling Stories: The Comic Art of Frank Frazetta'' (Underwood Books, 2008) pp. 14\u201317.</ref>\n\n{{cquote|Many have commented on the shift in Capp's political viewpoint, from as liberal as ''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]'' in his early years to as conservative as ''[[Little Orphan Annie]]'' when he reached middle age. At one extreme, he displayed consistently devastating humor, while at the other, his mean-spiritedness came to the fore \u2014 but which was which seems to depend on the commentator's ''own'' point of view. From beginning to end, Capp was acid-tongued toward the targets of his wit, intolerant of hypocrisy, and always wickedly funny. After about 40 years, however, Capp's interest in ''Abner'' waned, and this showed in the strip itself...|30|30|Don Markstein's ''Toonopedia''}}\n\n''Li'l Abner'' lasted until November 13, 1977, when Capp retired with an apology to his fans for the recently declining quality of the strip, which he said had been the best he could manage due to advancing illness. \"If you have any sense of humor about your strip \u2014 and I had a sense of humor about mine \u2014 you knew that for three or four years ''Abner'' was wrong. Oh hell, it's like a fighter retiring. I stayed on longer than I should have,\" he admitted.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,948819,00.html |title=Mr. Dogpatch\u2014 1979 '&#39;Time'&#39; obituary |publisher=Time.com |date=1979-11-19 |accessdate=2009-08-29}}</ref>  \"When he retired ''Li'l Abner'', newspapers ran expansive articles and television commentators talked about the passing of an era. ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine ran a substantial feature, and even the comics-free ''[[New York Times]]'' devoted nearly a full page to the event,\" according to publisher Denis Kitchen. Capp, a lifelong chain smoker, died from [[emphysema]] two years later at age 70, at his home in [[South Hampton, New Hampshire]] on November 5, 1979.\n\nIn 1988 and 1989 many newspapers ran reruns of ''Li'l Abner'' episodes, mostly from the 1940s run, distributed by [[Newspaper Enterprise Association]] and Capp Enterprises. Following the 1989 revival of the ''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]'' comic strip, a revival of ''Li'l Abner'' was also planned in 1990. Drawn by cartoonist [[Steve Stiles]],<ref>[http://stevestiles.com/capp.htm Passing Through Dogpatch: Al Capp's ''Li'l Abner'' by Steve Stiles]</ref> the new ''Abner'' was approved by Capp's widow and brother, [[Elliott Caplin]], but Al Capp's daughter, Julie Capp, objected at the last minute and permission was withdrawn.\n\n==''Li'l Abner'' in other media==\n\n===Radio and recordings===\nWith [[John Hodiak]] in the title role, the ''Li'l Abner'' [[radio serial]] ran weekdays on [[NBC]] from Chicago, from November 20, 1939 to December 6, 1940.

[[Durwood Kirby]] was the announcer. The radio show was not written by Al Capp \u2014 but by Charles Gussman. However, Gussman consulted closely with Capp on the storylines.

According to longtime NSA computer expert [[Samuel Simon Snyder]], \"We chose the name from Li'l Abner Yokum, the comic strip character who was a big brute, but not very smart, because we believed that computers, which can be big and do brute-force operations, aren't very bright either. They can only follow simple instructions but can't think for themselves.\" ABNER was originally given only 15 simple programs, later doubled to 30. Nevertheless, when it was secretly completed in April 1952 it was the \"most sophisticated computer of its time.\"<ref>''[[Body of Secrets]]: Anatomy of the Ultra-Secret National Security Agency'' (Anchor Books, 2002) by [[James Bamford]].</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n* The 1989 film ''I Want to Go Home'' (''Je Veux Rentrer a la Maison,'' screenplay by [[Jules Feiffer]]) has a scene where the main character, a retired cartoonist played by [[Adolph Green]], makes an unexpectedly emotional appeal for Al Capp and his legacy.\n* The original Dogpatch is a historical part of San Francisco dating back to the 1860s that escaped the [[San Francisco earthquake|earthquake and fire of 1906]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pier70sf.org/dogpatch/dogpatch_history.htm |title=Pier 70 |publisher=Pier70sf.org |date= |accessdate=2009-08-29}}</ref> \n* Later in the 20th century, [[U.S. Army]] and [[Marine Corps]] units in [[Vietnam]] during the [[Vietnam War]] called their housing compounds \"Dogpatches,\" due to the primitive living conditions.\n* Li'l Abner, Daisy Mae, Wolf Gal, Earthquake McGoon, Lonesome Polecat, Hairless Joe, Sadie Hawkins, Silent Yokum and Fearless Fosdick all found their way onto the [[nose art|painted noses]] of [[bomber aircraft]] during World War II and the [[Korean War]], as did Kickapoo Joy Juice, Lena the Hyena and the Shmoo. Moonbeam McSwine was immortalized as the [[P-51D Mustang]] [[USAAF]] [[bomber escort]] fighter flown by ace pilot Capt. [[William T. Whisner]], still operable and appearing in aviator [[air show]]s as of 2008.\n* Al Capp always claimed to have effectively created the [[miniskirt]], when he first put one on Daisy Mae in 1934.\n* ''Li'l Abner'' was [[censorship|censored]] for the first, but not the last time in September 1947, and was pulled from papers by [[Scripps-Howard]]. The controversy, as reported in ''Time'', centered on Capp's portrayal of the [[US Senate]]. Said Edward Leech of Scripps, \"We don't think it is good editing or sound citizenship to picture the Senate as an assemblage of freaks and crooks... boobs and undesirables.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,804275,00.html |title=Tain't Funny \u2014 '&#39;Time'&#39; |publisher=Time.com |date=1947-09-29 |accessdate=2009-08-29}}</ref>\n* Li'l Abner has one odd design quirk that has puzzled readers for decades: the part in his hair always faces the viewer, no matter which direction Abner is facing. In response to the question \"Which side does Abner part his hair on?,\" Capp would answer, \"Both.\" Capp claimed that he found the right \"look\" for Li'l Abner with [[Henry Fonda]]'s character Dave Tolliver in ''[[The Trail of the Lonesome Pine (1936 film)|The Trail of the Lonesome Pine]]'' (1936). Fonda later commented, \"He's never told me, but I was told he has said that.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/details/hollywoodspeaks00mike <!-- quote=fonda \"li'l abner\". --> Steen, Mike. ''Hollywood Speaks: An Oral History''. Putnam, 1974.]</ref>\n* [[Joan Baez]] took Al Capp to court in 1967 over Joanie Phoanie. She did not ask for damages; it was instead a bid to force a public retraction. The judge decided in Capp's favor, however. Declaring that satire was also protected [[free speech]], he refused to order Capp to cease and desist.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,843312,00.html |title=\"Which One Is the Phoanie?\" '&#39;Time'&#39; Jan. 20, 1967 |publisher=Time.com |date=1967-01-20 |accessdate=2009-08-29}}</ref> In recent years, Baez has admitted to being more amused by the parody \u2014 even including an excerpt in her memoirs (''And a Voice to Sing With: A Memoir'', published in 1987). \"I wish I could have laughed at this at the time,\" she wrote in a caption under one of the strips.\n* \"I didn't start this Mammy Yokum did.\" was the reply Ralph Kramden told his wife Alice (concerning a comment made by Ralph's mother in-law) in Episode #2 ''Funny Money'' of ''[[The Honeymooners]]''.\n* In 1960, [[Dixieland]] trombonist [[Turk Murphy]] christened his San Francisco jazz club \"Earthquake McGoon's,\" in honor of the perennial Dogpatch villain.\n* In 1968, the first year of operation, [[Dogpatch USA]] had 300,000 visitors. Admission was $1.50 for adults, and half price for children. Al Capp's son Colin Capp worked at the park that year, and met and married Vicki Cox, the actress portraying Moonbeam McSwine. Capp had previously spoofed the idea of a theme park based on his characters in ''Li'l Abner'', in a 1955 [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]] parody called \"Hal Yappland.\"\n* Al Capp designed the {{convert|23|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} statue of Josiah Flintabattey Flonatin (\"Flinty\") that graces the city of [[Flin Flon]], Manitoba. The town's name is taken from the lead character in a 1905 [[dime novel]], ''[[The Sunless City]]'' by [[J. E. Preston Muddock]]. Capp donated his time and talent to create the image. The character is of such importance to the identity of the city that the local Chamber of Commerce commissioned the minting of a $3.00 coin, which was considered legal tender within the city during the year following its issue. The Chamber had the [[fiberglass]] sculpture moved to its present location at the Flin Flon Tourist Park in 1962.\n* \"Natcherly,\" Capp's bastardization of \"naturally,\" turns up occasionally in popular culture \u2014 even without a specifically rural theme. It can be found in ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'', for instance, in [[Stephen Sondheim]]'s original lyrics to \"Gee, Officer Krupke\" (1957).\n* [[Mell Lazarus]], creator of ''[[Miss Peach]]'' and ''[[Momma]]'', wrote a comic novel in 1963 titled ''The Boss Is Crazy, Too.'' It was partly inspired by his apprenticeship days working for Al Capp and his brother Elliot Caplin at [[Toby Press]], which published ''Shmoo Comics'' in the late 1940s. In a seminar at the [[Charles Schulz Museum]] on November 8, 2008, Lazarus called his experience at Toby \"the five funniest years of my life.\" Lazarus went on to cite Capp as one of the \"four essentials\" in the field of newspaper cartoonists \u2014 along with Walt Kelly, Charles Schulz and Milton Caniff.\n* Utah governor [[Gary Herbert]] controversially referred to himself as \"Available Jones\", the Dogpatch entrepreneur who does anything for a price, at a private meeting with lobbyists April 27, 2016 to raise funds for his re-election campaign.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Roche|first1=Lisa Riley|title=Gov.

For 18 years, Abner slipped out of Daisy Mae's marital crosshairs time and time again. When Capp finally gave in to reader pressure and allowed the couple to tie the knot, it was a major media event.

Abner and Daisy Mae's nuptials were a major source of media attention, landing them on the aforementioned cover of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine's March 31, 1952, issue.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://cartoonician.com/big-deals-comics-highest-profile-moments/ |title=\"Big Deals: Comics\u2019 Highest-Profile Moments,\" ''Hogan's Alley'' #7, 1999 |access-date=2012-11-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630083743/http://cartoonician.com/big-deals-comics-highest-profile-moments/ |archive-date=2013-06-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Once married, Abner became relatively domesticated. Like Mammy Yokum and the other \"wimmenfolk\" in Dogpatch, Daisy Mae did all the work, domestic and otherwise \u2014 while the useless menfolk generally did nothing whatsoever.{{citation needed|reason=Is this a specific quote?|date=May 2016}}\n\n'''Mammy Yokum:''' Born '''Pansy Hunks''', Mammy was the scrawny, highly principled \"sassiety\" leader and bare knuckle \"champeen\" of the town of Dogpatch. She had married the inconsequential Pappy Yokum in 1902; they produced two strapping sons twice their own size. Mammy dominated the Yokum clan through the force of her personality, and dominated everyone else with her fearsome right uppercut (sometimes known as her \"Goodnight, Irene\" punch), which helped her uphold law, order and decency.<ref>[http://deniskitchen.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&Category_Code=bios.mammyyokum Mammy Yokum \"biography\" at deniskitchen.com]</ref> She is consistently the toughest character throughout ''Li'l Abner.'' A superhuman dynamo, Mammy did all the household chores \u2014 and provided her charges with no fewer than eight meals a day of \"po'k chops\" and \"tarnips,\" (as well as local Dogpatch delicacies like \"candied catfish eyeballs\" and \"trashbean soup\"). Her authority was unquestioned, and her characteristic phrase, \"Ah has ''spoken!,\"'' signaled the end of all further discussion. Her most familiar phrase, however, is \"Good is better than evil becuz it's ''nicer!\"'' (Upon his retirement in 1977, Capp declared Mammy to be his personal favorite of all his characters.)\n\n{{Anchor|Pappy Yokum}}'''Pappy Yokum:''' Born '''Lucifer Ornamental Yokum''', pint-sized Pappy had the misfortune of being the patriarch in a family that didn't have one. Pappy was so lazy and ineffectual, he didn't even bathe himself. Mammy was regularly seen scrubbing Pappy in an outdoor oak tub (\"Once a month, rain or shine\"). Ironing Pappy's trousers fell under her wifely duties as well, although she didn't bother with preliminaries \u2014 like waiting for Pappy to remove them first.<ref>[http://deniskitchen.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&Category_Code=bios.pappyyokum Pappy Yokum \"biography\" at deniskitchen.com]</ref> Pappy is dull-witted and gullible (in one storyline after he is conned by Marry'n Sam into buying Vanishing cream because he thinks it makes him ''invisible'' when he picks a fight with his nemesis Earthquake McGoon), but not completely without guile. He had an unfortunate predilection for snitching \"presarved tarnips\" and smoking corn silk behind the woodshed \u2014 much to his chagrin when Mammy caught him. Pappy Yokum wasn't always feckless, however. After his lower wisdom teeth grew so long that they squeezed his cerebral Goodness Gland and emerged as forehead horns, he proved himself capable of evil. Of course Mammy solved the problem with a tooth extraction, and ended the episode with her most famous dictum.\n\n'''Honest Abe Yokum:''' Li'l Abner and Daisy Mae's little boy was born in 1953 \"after a pregnancy that ambled on so long that readers began sending me medical books,\" wrote Capp. Initially known as \"Mysterious Yokum\" (there was even an [[Ideal Toy Company|Ideal]] doll marketed under this name) due to a debate regarding his gender (he was stuck in a pants-shaped stovepipe for the first six weeks), he was renamed \"Honest Abe\" (after President [[Abraham Lincoln]]) to thwart his early tendency to steal.<ref>[http://www.deniskitchen.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&Category_Code=bios.honest.abe Honest Abe \"biography\" at deniskitchen.com]</ref> His first words were \"po'k chop,\" and that remained his favorite food. Though his uncle Tiny was perpetually frozen at 15\u00bd \"y'ars\" old, Honest Abe gradually grew from infant to grade school age, and became a dead ringer for '''Washable Jones''' \u2014 the star of Capp's early \"[[topper (comic strip)|topper]]\" strip. He would eventually acquire a couple of supporting character friends for his own semi-regularly featured adventures in the strip. In one storyline he lives up to his nickname when during a nationwide search for [[George Washington]]\u2019s missing socks (the finder gets to shake the President of the United States\u2019s hand); after dishonestly producing a fraudulent pair, he confess to the truth at the last second.\n\n'''Tiny Yokum:''' \"Tiny\" was a [[misnomer]]; Li'l Abner's kid brother remained perpetually innocent and 15\u00bd \"y'ars\" old \u2014 despite the fact that he was an imposing, {{convert|7|ft|m|adj=on}} tall behemoth. Tiny was unknown to the strip until September 1954, when a relative who had been raising him reminded Mammy that she'd given birth to a second \"chile\"  while visiting her 15 years earlier. (The relative explained that she would have dropped him off sooner, but waited until she happened to be in the neighborhood.) Capp introduced Tiny to fill the bachelor role played reliably for nearly two decades by Li'l Abner himself, until his fateful 1952 marriage threw the carefully orchestrated dynamic of the strip out of whack for a period.<ref>[http://deniskitchen.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&Category_Code=bios.tinyyokum Tiny Yokum \"biography\" at deniskitchen.com]</ref> Pursued by local lovelies '''Hopeful Mudd''' and '''Boyless Bailey''', Tiny was even dumber and more awkward than Abner, if that can be imagined. Tiny initially sported a bulbous nose like both of his parents, but eventually,  (through a plot contrivance) he was given a nose job, and his shaggy blond hair was [[buzz cut]] to make him more appealing.\n\n'''Salomey:''' The Yokums' beloved pet. Cute, lovable and intelligent (arguably smarter than Abner, Tiny or Pappy), she was accepted as part of the family (\"the youngest,\" as Mammy invariably introduces her). She is 100% \"Hammus Alabammus\" \u2014 an adorable species of pig, and the last female known in existence. A plump, juicy ''Hammus Alabammus'' is the rarest and most vital ingredient of \"ecstasy sauce,\" an indescribably delicious gourmet delicacy. Consequently, Salomey is frequently targeted by unscrupulous sportsmen, hog breeders and gourmands (like '''J.R. Fangsley''' and '''Bounder J. Roundheels'''), as well as unsavory [[boar]]s with improper intentions (such as '''Boar Scarloff''' and '''Porknoy'''). Her moniker was a pun on both [[salami]] and [[Salome]].\n\n===Supporting characters and villains===\n* '''Marryin' Sam:''' A traveling (by mule) preacher who specializes in $2 weddings. He also offered the $8 \"ultra-deluxe speshul,\" a spectacular ceremony in which Sam officiates while being drawn and quartered by four rampaging jackasses. He cleans up once a year \u2014 during [[Sadie Hawkins Day]] season, when slow-footed bachelors are dragged kicking and screaming to the altar by their prospective brides-to-be.<ref>[http://deniskitchen.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&Category_Code=bios.marryin.sam Marryin' Sam \"biography\" at deniskitchen.com]</ref> Sam, whose face and figure were reportedly modeled after New York City mayor [[Fiorello LaGuardia]],<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=fU8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA12&lpg=PA12&dq=abner+capp++time+marryin'+sam+laGuardia&source=bl&ots=C40sJJGW6s&sig=SKcobOOGR19FajlE2iFfJFPPkyE&hl=en&ei=vrpSTv_sGcTYiAKU5JjvDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q&f=false \"Speaking of Pictures,\" ''Life'', 12 June 1944]</ref> started out as a stock villain but gradually softened into a genial, opportunistic comic foil. He wasn't above chicanery to achieve his ends, and was warily viewed by Dogpatch menfolk as a traitor to his gender. Sam was prominently featured on the cover of ''Life'' in 1952 when he presided over the celebrated wedding of Li'l Abner and Daisy Mae. In the 1956 Broadway musical and 1959 film adaptation, Sam was played by rotund actor [[Stubby Kaye]].\n* '''Moonbeam McSwine:''' The unwashed but shapely form of languid, delectable Moonbeam was one of the iconic hallmarks of ''Li'l Abner'' \u2014 an unkempt, impossibly lazy, corncob pipe-smoking, flagrant (and ''fragrant)'', raven-haired, earthly (and ''earthy)'' woman. Beautiful Moonbeam preferred the company of pigs to suitors \u2014 much to the frustration of her equally lazy pappy, '''Moonshine McSwine'''. She was usually showcased luxuriating among the hogs, somewhat removed from the main action of the story, in a deliberate parody of glamour magazines and [[pinup]] calendars of the day. Capp designed her in caricature of his wife Catherine (minus the dirt), who had also suggested Daisy Mae's name. In one comic it is revealed that she bears a striking resemblance to a wealthy, well-dressed and well-washed woman named [[Gloria Vanderbilt|Gloria Van Welbuilt]], a famous socialite. Despite her lazy nature and dirty appearance she was generally good-natured and kind as shown when she ran off to Dogpatch, carrying two shmoos under her arms to save them from going extinct, wondering if humanity would ever be good enough for them. She also consoled Abner to stop worrying about being a father. Moonbeam also seemed to have interests in romance as in some strips she was seen flirting with and even kissing various male characters, including Abner. She once expressed the desire of having a family of her own and she actually discussed the matter of trapping a husband (if she got cleaned up) with Abner. In one strip it was revealed that Moonbeam was in fact in love with Abner when they were children. In the same strip it was shown that Moonbeam\u2019s disposition for filth was born out of a failure to understand the turn-ons of Abner when he was a child. Strangely she actually disliked hogs as a child but after seeing Abner ignoring the openly romantic advances of a clean Daisy Mae, she dived right into a mud-hole headfirst where some hogs were wallowing to earn his love, believing that if Abner didn't like clean girls he must have liked them dirty. Much to her disappointment, however, this, too, failed to capture his attention. Moonbeam was also unknowingly the star of a horror movie directed by Rock Pincus, head film director of a race known as the Pincushions, from  planet Pincus 7. Unfortunately this venture ended in tragedy for Rock when he was unknowingly grilled, put into a hot dog bun and devoured while he was still alive.\n* '''Hairless Joe and Lonesome Polecat:''' The proud purveyors of \"Kickapoo Joy Juice\" \u2014 a [[moonshine]] elixir of such stupefying potency that the fumes alone have been known to melt the rivets off battleships. Concocted in a large wooden vat by the inseparable cave-dwelling buddies Lonesome Polecat (of the \"Fried Dog\" [[Indian tribe]], later known as the Polecats, \"the one tribe who have never been conquered,\") and Hairless Joe (a hirsute, club-wielding, modern [[Cro-Magnon]] \u2014 who frequently made good on his oft-repeated threat, \"Ah'll ''bash'' yore ''haid'' in!\") The ingredients of the brew are both mysterious and all-encompassing<ref>[http://deniskitchen.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&Category_Code=bios.joyjuice Kickapoo Joy Juice page at deniskitchen.com]</ref> (much like the contents of their cave, which has been known to harbor [[dinosaur|prehistoric monsters]]). When a batch \"needs more body,\" the formidable pair simply goes out and clubs one (often a moose), and tosses it in. Over the years, the \"recipe\" has called for live grizzly bears, panthers, kerosene, horseshoes and anvils, among other ingredients. An officially licensed soft drink called [[Kickapoo Joy Juice]] is still produced by the [[Monarch Beverage Company]] of [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Lonesome Polecat was also the official team [[mascot]] of the Sioux City Soos (1940\u20131960),<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Sioux_City_Soos Sioux City Soos at Baseball-Reference.com]</ref> a former [[Minor League]] baseball franchise of [[Sioux City, Iowa]].\n* '''Joe Btfsplk:''' The world's worst [[jinx]], [[Joe Btfsplk]] had a perpetually dark rain cloud over his head. Instantaneous bad luck befell anyone unfortunate enough to be in his vicinity. Though well-meaning and friendly, his reputation inevitably precedes him \u2014 so Joe is a very lonely little man \u2014 so he associates himself with the Scraggs{{nbsp}}\u2013 except in World War II when Joe decided to do his patriotic duty \u2014 and associate himself with [[Hirohito]]!. He has an apparently unpronounceable name, but creator Al Capp \"pronounced\" Btfsplk by simply blowing a \"raspberry,\" or [[Bronx cheer (gesture)|Bronx cheer]].<ref>[http://deniskitchen.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&Category_Code=bios.joe.btfsplk Joe Btfsplk \"biography\" at deniskitchen.com]</ref> Joe's personal storm cloud became one of the most iconic images in the strip.\n* '''Senator Jack S. Phogbound:''' His name was a thinly disguised variant on \"jackass,\" as made plain in his deathless campaign slogan (see Dialogue and [[catchphrase]]s). The senator was satirist Al Capp's parody of a blustering self-serving Southern politician. Before 1947 Phogbound had been known as Fogbound, but in that year Phogbound \"blackmails his fellow Washington senators to appropriate two million dollars to establish Phogbound University,\" and its attendant brass statue of Phogbound, both reminiscent of self-aggrandizements by Huey Long;<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=IuTiI-zzjkkC&pg=PA21&lpg=PA21&dq=jack+s.+phogbound+huey+long&source=bl&ots=iHIo_b2kk2&sig=H6AD0ouBGjXysJc0sOz2VADIwWc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCUQ6AEwAWoVChMI5qWJ-8axyAIVg6CACh0PVApO#v=onepage&q=jack%20s.%20phogbound%20huey%20long&f=false]</ref> the name change allowed Capp to sharpen the joke by calling the university P.U.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=mOE-VOlZDtYC&pg=PA91&lpg=PA91&dq=phogbound+university&source=bl&ots=S723qf4AQn&sig=zdU7Id-3CZpx7dpoMuNTB7VPLmM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CC8Q6AEwA2oVChMI7IGmw8exyAIVytOACh0Jog9l#v=onepage&q=phogbound%20university&f=false]</ref>  Phogbound is a corrupt, conspiratorial blowhard; he often wears a [[coonskin cap]] and carries an old fashioned [[flintlock musket|flintlock rifle]] to impress his gullible constituents. In one sequence, Phogbound is unable to campaign in Dogpatch \u2014 so he sends his aides with an old, hot air-filled gas bag that resembles him. Nobody ''noticed the difference''!\n* '''Available Jones:''' Dogpatch entrepreneur Available Jones was always available \u2014 for a price. He had many sidelines, including minding babies (Dry \u2014 5\u00a2, Other kinds \u2014 10\u00a2). He provided anything from a safety pin to a battleship, but his most famous \"provision\" was his memorable cousin \u2014 Stupefyin' Jones.\n* '''Stupefyin' Jones:''' A walking [[aphrodisiac]], Stupefyin' was stunning \u2014 literally. So drop-dead gorgeous that any male who glimpsed her froze petrified in his tracks and rooted to the spot \u2014 in a word, ''stupefied!'' While she was generally favored by the males of Dogpatch, she could be deadly for a confirmed bachelor to encounter on [[Sadie Hawkins Day]]. Statuesque actress [[Julie Newmar]] became famous overnight for playing the small role in the 1956 ''Li'l Abner'' Broadway musical (and the 1959 film adaptation) without uttering a single line.<ref>[http://deniskitchen.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&Category_Code=bios.stupefyin Stupefyin' Jones \"biography\" at deniskitchen.com]</ref>\n* '''General Bullmoose:''' Created by Al Capp in June 1953, Bashington T. Bullmoose was the epitome of a mercenary, cold-blooded capitalist tyrant tycoon. Bullmoose's bombastic motto (see Dialogue and catchphrases) was adapted by Capp from a statement made by [[Charles Erwin Wilson|Charles E. Wilson]], the former head of [[General Motors]] when it was America's largest corporation. In 1952 Wilson told a Senate subcommittee, \"What is good for the country is good for General Motors, and vice-versa.\" Wilson later served as [[United States Secretary of Defense]] under President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]].<ref>[http://deniskitchen.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&Category_Code=bios.gen.bullmoose General Bullmoose \"biography\" at deniskitchen.com]</ref> Bullmoose had a simple boyhood dream: to possess all the money in the world. He very nearly did. Bullmoose Industries seemed to own or control ''everything''. He had a milksop of a son named '''Weakfish''', and was sometimes accompanied by his delectable \"secretary,\" '''Bim Bovak''' (whose name was a [[pun]] on both \"bimbo\" and [[bombshell (sex symbol)|bombshell]] actress [[Kim Novak]]). Li'l Abner became embroiled in many globetrotting adventures with the ruthless, reactionary billionaire over the years. Despite his adamantine exterior, General Bullmoose was still capable of a kind of capitalist gallantry. \"Those Slobbovians [q.v.] have done me out of a hundred thousand dollars!\" he once exclaimed, after falling victim to a fraud. \"Nearly an hour's income, bless 'em!\"\n* '''Wolf Gal:''' A [[feral]], irredeemable, [[Amazons|Amazonian]] beauty who was raised by wolves and preferred to live among them; she lured unwary Dogpatchers to their doom to feed her ravenous pack. Wolf Gal was possibly, and even probably a [[cannibal]] \u2014 although the point was never stressed since she considered herself an animal, as did the rest of Dogpatch. One of Capp's more popular villains, Wolf Gal was briefly merchandised in the fifties with her own comic book, doll, [[handpuppet]], and even a [[latex]] [[Halloween]] mask.\n* '''Earthquake McGoon:''' Billing himself as \"the world's dirtiest [[Professional wrestling|wrassler]],\" the bearded, bloated McGoon first appeared in ''Li'l Abner'' as a traveling exhibition wrestler in the late 1930s, and was reportedly partially based on real-life grappler [[Man Mountain Dean]]. He also has a look-alike cousin named '''Typhoon McGoon'''. McGoon became increasingly prominent in the ''Li'l Abner'' [[Cream of Wheat]] print ads of the 1940s, and later, with the early television exposure of gimmicky wrestlers such as [[Gorgeous George]].<ref>[http://deniskitchen.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&Category_Code=bios.mcgoon Earthquake McGoon \"biography\" at deniskitchen.com]</ref> Earthquake is the nastiest resident of neighboring Skonk Hollow \u2014 a nightmarish, notoriously lawless community where no sane Dogpatcher dares set foot. The randy McGoon often attempted to walk Daisy Mae home \"Skonk Hollow style\" \u2014 the lascivious implications of which are never made specific.\n* '''The ''(shudder!)'' Scraggs:''' Hulking, leering, gap-toothed twin miscreants '''Lem and Luke''' and their needlessly proud pappy, '''Romeo'''. Apelike and gleefully homicidal, the impossibly evil Scraggs were officially declared inhuman by an act of [[United States Congress|Congress]]. The Scraggs were so awful, they burned down orphanages just to have light to read by (although the joke was on them when they remembered they couldn't read!) Distant kinfolk of Daisy Mae, they carried on a blood [[feud]] with the Yokums throughout the run of the strip-in their first introduction after being run out of a Kentucky county at gunpoint, they tried to kill Li'l Abner but were beaten up by both Abner and his mother Mammy Yokum; Mammy then banished the Scraggs to Skonk Hollow with a dividing line between  Skonk Hollow and Dogpatch \u2014 with the understanding that although the Scraggs couldn't cross the line, any member of Dogpatch who did cross was prey to the Scraggs! (As did happen to Rotten Ralphie). A long-lost kid sister named '''\"*@!!*!\"-Belle Scragg''' briefly joined the clan in 1947. Fetchingly-attired in a prison-striped [[reform school]] miniskirt, \"*@!!*!\"-Belle was outwardly attractive but just as rotten as her siblings on the inside. Her censored first name was an [[Profanity|expletive]], compelling everyone who addressed her to apologize profusely afterwards.\n* '''Nightmare Alice:''' Dogpatch's own \"conjurin' woman,\" a hideous, cackling crone who practiced [[Louisiana Voodoo]] and [[black magic]]. Capp named her after the carnival-themed horror film, ''[[Nightmare Alley (1947 film)|Nightmare Alley]]'' (1947). Alice employs [[witchcraft]] to \"whomp up\" ghosts and monsters to do her bidding. She was occasionally assisted by '''Doctor Babaloo''', a [[witch doctor]] of the [[Belgian Congo]], as well as her demon-child niece '''Scary Lou''', who specializes in vexing [[voodoo doll]]s that resemble Li'l Abner.\n* '''Ole Man Mose:''' The mysterious Mose was reportedly hundreds of \"y'ars\" old, and lived like a hermit in a cave atop a mountain. (He obstinately refused to \"kick the bucket,\" which was conveniently positioned just outside his cave door.) His wisdom is absolute (\"Ole Man Mose \u2014 ''he knows!\"''), and his sought-after annual Sadie Hawkins Day predictions \u2014 though frustratingly cryptic and infuriatingly misleading \u2014 are nonetheless 100% accurate.\n* '''Evil Eye Fleagle:''' Fleagle has a unique and terrifying skill \u2014 the [[evil eye]]. An ordinary \"whammy,\" as he called it, could stop a charging bull in its tracks. A \"double whammy\" could fell a skyscraper, leaving Fleagle exhausted. His dreaded \"triple whammy\" could melt a battleship \u2014 but would practically kill Fleagle in the process.<ref>[http://deniskitchen.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&Category_Code=bios.evil.eye Evil-Eye Fleegle \"biography\" at deniskitchen.com]</ref> The zoot suit-clad Fleagle was a native of [[Brooklyn]], and his burlesque New York accent was unmistakable \u2014 especially when addressing his \"goil,\" the [[zaftig]] '''Shoiley'''. Fleagle was so popular, licensed plastic replicas of Fleagle's face were produced in the 1950s, to be worn like lapel pins. Battery-operated, the wearer could pull a string and produce a flashing light bulb \"whammy.\" Fleagle was reportedly based on a real-life character, a [[Damon Runyon|Runyonesque]] local [[boxing]] trainer and hanger-on named Benjamin \"Evil Eye\" Finkle. Finkle and his famous \"hex\" were a ringside fixture in New York boxing circles during the 1930s and '40s. Fleagle was vividly portrayed by [[character actor]] [[Al Nesor]] in the aforementioned stage play and film.\n* '''J. Roaringham Fatback:''' The self-styled \"Pork King\" was a greedy, gluttonous, unscrupulous business tycoon. Incensed to find that Dogpatch cast a shadow on his breakfast egg, he had Dogpatch moved \u2014 instead of the egg. The bloated, porcine Fatback is, quite literally, a corporate swine.\n* '''Gat Garson:''' Li'l Abner's ''[[doppelg\u00e4nger]]'' \u2014 a murderous racketeer, with a predilection for Daisy Mae.\n* '''Aunt Bessie:''' Mammy's socialite kid sister, the Duchess of Bopshire, was the \"white sheep\" of the family. Bessie's string of marriages into [[Boston]] and [[Park Avenue (Manhattan)|Park Avenue]] [[aristocracy]] left her a class-conscious, condescending snob. Her status-seeking crusade to makeover Abner and marry him off into [[upper class|high society]] was doomed to failure, however. Aunt Bessie virtually disappeared from the strip after Abner and Daisy Mae's marriage in 1952.\n* '''Big Barnsmell:''' The lonely \"inside man\" at the \"Skonk Works\" \u2014 a dilapidated factory located on the remote outskirts of Dogpatch. Scores of locals are done in yearly by the toxic fumes of concentrated \"skonk oil,\" which is brewed and barreled daily by Barnsmell and his cousin (\"outside man\" '''Barney Barnsmell''') by grinding dead [[skunk]]s and worn shoes into a smoldering [[still]], for some unspecified purpose. His job played havoc with his social life (\"He has an air about him,\" as Dogpatchers tactfully put it), and the name of his famous facility entered the modern lexicon via the [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] [[Skunk Works]] project.\n* '''Soft-Hearted John:''' Dogpatch's impossibly mercenary, thoroughly blackhearted grocer, the ironically named Soft-Hearted John gleefully swindled and starved his clientele \u2014 and looked disturbingly satanic to boot. He had an idiot of a nephew who sometimes ran the store in his stead, aptly named '''Soft-Headed John'''.\n* '''Smilin' Zack:''' Cadaverous, outwardly peaceable mountaineer with a menacing grin and an even more menacing shotgun. He preferred things \"quiet.\" (''Real'' quiet, that is \u2014 not breathing or anything.) Zack's moniker was a take-off on another comic strip, ''[[The Adventures of Smilin' Jack]]'' by [[Zack Mosley]].\n* '''Dr. Killmare:''' The local Dogpatch physician, who just happened to be a horse doctor. His name was a pun on movie, radio and TV's ''[[Dr. Kildare]]'' series.\n* '''Cap'n Eddie Ricketyback:''' Decrepit [[World War I]] [[aviator]] and proprietor/sole operator of the even more decrepit Dogpatch Airlines. Cap'n Eddie's name was a spoof of decorated World War I flying ace, [[Eddie Rickenbacker]]. In 1970, Cap'n Eddie and his firm Trans-Dogpatch Airlines were awarded the West Berlin Route by his old rival Count Felix Von Holenhedt.\n* '''Count Felix Von Holenhedt:''' German flying ace who in 1970 (age 89) was appointed as West German Civil Aviation Chief. He was never photographed without his World War I spiked helmet on his head. He wore it to cover the hole in his head that had been caused by being shot \"clean through th' haid, in a dogfight over Flanders Field in 1918\" by Cap'n Eddie Ricketyback. Nonetheless the two old enemies eventually patched things up; Cap'n Ricketyback even convinced the Count to settle in the States. \"Jah!\" cried the Count. \"I got a cousin in Milvaukee!\"\n* '''Weakeyes Yokum:''' Before [[Mister Magoo]] there was Dogpatch's own Cousin Weakeyes, who would tragically mistake grizzly bears for romantically-inclined \"rich gals\" in fur coats, and end a sequence by characteristically walking off a cliff.\n* '''Young Eddie McSkonk and U.S. Mule:''' Ancient, creaky, white-bearded Dogpatch postmaster and his hoary jackass mount. They were usually too feeble to handle the sacks of timeworn, cobweb-covered letters marked \"Rush\" at the Dogpatch Express Post Office.\n* '''J. Colossal McGenius:''' The brilliant marketing consultant and \"idea man\" who charged $10,000 per word for his sought-after business advice. McGenius was given to telling long-winded jokes with forgotten punch lines, however \u2014 as well as spells of hiccups and belches which, at ten grand a pop, usually [[bankruptcy|bankrupted]] his unfortunate clients. (He had a regrettable fondness for gassy soft drinks like \"Burpsi-Booma\" and \"Eleven Urp.\") He was aided by his lovely and meticulously efficient secretary, '''Miss Pennypacker'''.\n* '''Silent Yokum:''' Prudent Cousin Silent never utters a word unless it's absolutely, ''vitally'' important. Consequently, he hadn't spoken in 40 years. The arrival of Silent's grim visage in Dogpatch signaled earthshaking news on the horizon. Capp would milk reader suspense by having Silent \"warm up\" his rusty, creaking jaw muscles for a few days, before the momentous pronouncement.\n* '''Happy Vermin:''' The \"world's smartest cartoonist\" \u2014 a caricature of [[Ham Fisher]] \u2014 who hired Li'l Abner to draw his comic strip for him in a dimly-lit closet. Instead of using Vermin's tired characters, Abner had inventively peopled the strip with hillbillies. A bighearted Vermin told his slaving assistant: \"I'm proud of having created these characters!! They'll make millions for me!! And if they do \u2014 I'll get ''you'' a new light bulb!!\"\n* '''Big Stanislouse;''' aka '''Big Julius:''' Stanislouse was a brutal gangster with a childish fondness for kiddie TV superheroes (like \"Chickensouperman\" and \"Milton the Masked Martian\"). Part of a virtual goon squad of comic mobsters that inhabited ''Li'l Abner'' and ''Fearless Fosdick'', the oafish Stanislouse alternated with other all-purpose underworld thugs, including \"the Boys from the Syndicate\" \u2014 Capp's [[euphemism]] for [[Mafia|The Mob]].\n* '''The Square-Eyes Family:''' Mammy's revelatory encounter with these unpopular Dogpatch outcasts first appeared in 1956. The [[fable]]-like story was really a thinly-veiled appeal for racial tolerance. It was later issued as an educational comic book \u2014 called ''Mammy Yokum and the Great Dogpatch Mystery!'' \u2014 by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] of [[B'nai B'rith]].\n* '''Appassionata Von Climax:''' One of a series of predatory, sexually aggressive sirens who pursued Li'l Abner prior to his marriage, and even afterwards, much to the consternation of Daisy Mae. Joining a long list of dishy ''[[femmes fatales]]'' and spoiled debutantes that included '''Gloria Van Welbilt, Moonlight Sonata, Mimi Van Pett''' and '''\"The Tigress\"'''; Appassionata was memorably portrayed by both [[Tina Louise]] (onstage) and [[Stella Stevens]] (on film). Capp always wondered how he ever got her suggestive name past the censors.\n* '''Tenderleif Ericson:''' Discovered frozen in the mud where her [[Viking]] ship sank in 1047, Tenderleif was [[Leif Ericson]]'s beautiful, teenaged kid sister (complete with [[breastplate]] [[armor]], Viking helmet and burlesque [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] accent). As soon as she saw Li'l Abner, however, she started warming up and breathing hard. \"She's seventeen y'ars old,\" explains Mammy, \"and she hain't had a date fo' nine hunnerd y'ars!\"\n* '''Princess Minihahaskirt:''' Decades before [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]'', the sexiest cartoon Indian princesses could be found in ''Li'l Abner''. The latest in a series of lovely native maidens who enticed the normally stoic Lonesome Polecat, the list also included '''Minnie Mustache, Raving Dove, Little Turkey Wing''' and '''Princess Two Feathers'''.\n* '''Liddle Noodnik:''' A typically miserable resident of perpetually frozen [[Lower Slobbovia]], naked local waif Liddle Noodnik was usually employed to recite a farcical poem of greeting to visiting dignitaries, or sing the absurd Slobbovian [[national anthem]] (see \"setting and fictitious locales\"). Like many terms in ''Li'l Abner'', Noodnik's name was derived from [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]. ''[[List of English words of Yiddish origin|Nudnik]]'' is a slang term for a bothersome person or pest.\n* '''Pantless Perkins:''' A very late addition to the strip, Capp introduced Honest Abe's brainy, ragamuffin pal Pantless Perkins in a series of kid-themed stories in the seventies, probably to compete with ''[[Peanuts (comic strip)|Peanuts]]''. Poor Pantless didn't own a single pair of trousers. He wore an over-length turtleneck sweater to hide the fact \u2014 much to his embarrassment. In one storyline {Feb/March 1972}the nearest he ever got a pair of pants was when he helps Honest Abe find a long lost love of a millionaire in return for a pair of pants. Unfortunately the prospective groom drops dead after tasting the terrible cooking of his bride to be \u2014 and Pantless remains pantless!\n* '''Rotten Ralphie:''' The kiddie version of Earthquake McGoon, Ralphie lived up to his name \u2014 he was the perfectly rotten Dogpatch neighborhood bully. Exceedingly large for his age, Ralphie always wore a cowboy outfit that was several sizes too small. In one storyline after Ralphie beats up every boy in Dogpatch at the same time, he himself is beaten up when Pantless Perkins and Honest Abe trick Ralphie into getting into a fight with the Scragg boys of Skonk Hollow!\n* '''Marcia Perkins:''' Innocent, outwardly normal teenager whose lips give off 451&nbsp;\u00b0F of [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic heat]], frying the brain of any boy who kisses her. Declared a walking health hazard, poor Marcia must wear a public warning sign (\"Do Not Kiss This Girl, by Order of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Dept. of Health, Education and Welfare]]\"). Her notoriety precedes her everywhere except Dogpatch \u2014 where she meets and falls for Tiny Yokum.\n* '''Bet-a-Million Bashby:''' Bashby amassed his colossal fortune by following one simple rule: Always bet on a sure thing, and always bet with a fool. He hadn't reckoned on fool's luck, however. All through the years Bashby bet on sure things, and all through the years Abner won.\n* '''The Widder Fruitful:''' Another iconic Dogpatch \"regular,\" often glimpsed in passing or featured in crowd scenes. The ample, fertile widow invariably held three or four naked newborns under each arm, always carried backside forward, with a healthy brood of earlier offspring following in her wake.\n* '''Loverboynik:''' In 1954, Capp sent a letter to [[Liberace]] addressing his intention to spoof him in ''Li'l Abner'' as \"Liverachy.\" Liberace had his lawyers threaten to sue. Capp went ahead anyway, with a significant name change. Billed as the \"Sweetheart of the Piano,\" Loverboynik is a blonde \"dimpled darling\" pianist and TV heartthrob. According to Capp, Liberace was \"cut to the quick\" when the parody appeared. Capp insisted that Loverboynik was ''not'' Liberace because Loverboynik \"could play the piano rather decently and rarely wore black lace underwear.\"<ref>\"The Comic Page Is the Last Refuge of Classic Art,\" ''NEMO'' #18, April 1986, pg. 16</ref>\n* '''Rock Hustler:''' Unscrupulous publicity agent-turned-marketing mogul. He masterminds an ad campaign promoting the miracle diet food \"Mockaroni,\" carefully neglecting to disclose that it's both addictive and lethal. \"The more you crave, the more you eat. The more you eat, the thinner you get \u2014 until you ''(shudder!)'' float away...\"\n* '''Dumpington Van Lump:''' The bloated, almost [[catatonic]] heir to the Van Lump fortune, Dumpington can only utter one syllable (\"Urp!\") ...until he sets sight on Daisy Mae. A somewhat subhuman fiend, his favorite book is the disturbingly-titled \"How to Make Lampshades Out of Your Friends.\" Capp chose the Dumpington sequence to illustrate his lesson on continuity storytelling in the ''Famous Artists Cartoon Course''.\n* '''Sam the Centaur:''' A \"mythical critter\" with a classic, chiseled profile and [[Apollo]]-like blonde mane, Sam is a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[centaur]] who occasionally roams the mountains of Dogpatch instead of the mountains of [[Thessaly]]. Available Jones, \"th' most book-educated varmint in Dogpatch,\" pronounces: \"He ''hain't'' real!\"\n* '''Jubilation T. Cornpone:''' Dogpatch's founder and most famous son, memorialized by a town statue, is [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] General Jubilation T. Cornpone \u2014 renowned for \"Cornpone's Retreat,\" \"Cornpone's Disaster,\" \"Cornpone's Stupidity,\" \"Cornpone's Misjudgment,\" \"Cornpone's Hoolmiliation\" and \"Cornpone's Final Mistake\". Cornpone was such a disastrously incompetent military leader that he came to be considered an important asset of the ''opposing side''. According to the stage play, the statue was commissioned by a grateful President [[Abraham Lincoln]]! Cornpone's only victories were posthumous \u2014 in one storyline, the General's statue is filled with Kickapoo Joy juice, which brings it to \"life.\" It then goes on a rampage, beheading all the statues of [[Union (American Civil War)|Union Army]] generals. As the U.S. Army can't destroy it \u2014 since it's a [[National Monument]] \u2014 Kickapoo Joy Juice is poured into a Union statue which results in both statutes charging one another. When the smoke clears, the animated statues have annihilated each other. At Mammy Yokum's urging the statue pieces are put together with glue. The hapless general is really best known for being the namesake of the rousing musical number (a \"showstopper\") in the popular ''[[Li'l Abner (musical)|Li'l Abner]]'' musical, as sung by Marryin' Sam and chorus.\n* '''Jubilation T. Cornpone Jr:''' son of General Cornpone; formerly \"commanded\" army mules; became Commander of all U.N. Forces against Invaders from Outer Space \u2014 despite being described as the most incompetent general of all time \u2014 he was given the job because no other General would take it!  {Feb 1959}; fell in love with big eyes \"Princess Pocahauntingeyes\" and lived with her in the land above the Dogpatch via the \"Trashbean stalk\"; henpecked Cornpone admits to Honest Abe however that all is not bliss \u2014 his \"Big eyed\" wife eyes have got smaller and her mouth is bigger! {Nov 20, 1971}\n* '''Romeo McHaystack:''' A would be [[Don Juan]] of Pineapple Junction whose attempts at romancing women are frustrated because the Civic Improvement League tattooed a warning about him on his forehead. Discouraged, he suddenly decides to romance Dogpatch women when he discovers that because atomic waste is suspended above Dogpatch, Dogpatch is permanently in darkness!<ref>[http://www.gocomics.com/lil-abner/2013/09/01 Go Comics]</ref> (The waste was dropped on Dogpatch because it was thought nobody lived there since no [[income tax]]es had been filed there since 1776!)\n* '''Sadie Hawkins:''' In the early days of Dogpatch, Sadie Hawkins was \"the homeliest gal in them hills\" who grew frantic waiting for suitors to come a-courtin'. Her father '''Hekzebiah Hawkins''', a prominent Dogpatch resident, grew even more frantic \u2014 about Sadie living at home for the rest of his life. So he decreed the first annual [[Sadie Hawkins Day]], a foot race in which all the unmarried women pursued the town's bachelors, with matrimony as the consequence.<ref>[http://deniskitchen.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&Category_Code=bios.evil.eye Sadie Hawkins \"biography\" at deniskitchen.com]</ref> A pseudo-holiday entirely created in the strip, it's still frequently observed today in the form of [[Sadie Hawkins dance]]s, to which it is customary for women to ask men and at which women approach (or chase after) men.\n* '''Lena the Hyena:''' A hideous Lower Slobbovian gal, referred to but initially unseen or only glimpsed from the neck down in ''Li'l Abner.'' Lena was so ugly that anyone who saw her was immediately driven mad. No sane person, therefore, could tell you what she looked like. After weeks of teasing his readers by hiding Lena's face behind \"censored\" stickers and strategically placed dialogue balloons, Capp invited fans to draw Lena in a famous nationwide contest in 1946. Lena was ultimately revealed in the harrowing winning entry (as judged by [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Boris Karloff]] and [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]]) drawn by noted cartoonist [[Basil Wolverton]].\n* '''Joanie Phoanie:''' An unabashed [[Communism|Communist]] radical and agitator, who sang revolutionary songs of [[class conflict|class warfare]] (with burlesque titles like \"[[Molotov cocktail|Molotov]] [[Cocktails for Two]]\") \u2014 while hypocritically traveling via [[limousine]] and charging outrageous concert appearance fees to impoverished orphans. Joanie was Capp's notorious parody of protest singer/songwriter [[Joan Baez]]. The character caused a storm of controversy in 1966, and many newspapers would only run [[censorship|censored]] versions of the strips. Baez took Capp's implicit satire to heart, however, as she would admit years later in her autobiography: \"Mr Capp confused me considerably. I'm sorry he's not alive to read this, it would make him chuckle,\" (from ''And a Voice to Sing With: A Memoir'', 1987).\n* '''S.W.I.N.E.:''' Capp used ''Li'l Abner'' to satirize current events, fads, and ephemeral popular culture (such as [[zoot suit]]s in \"Zoot Suit Yokum,\" 1943). Beginning in the mid-1960s, the strip became a forum for Capp's increasingly [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] political views. Capp, who lived in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], just a stone's throw from [[Harvard University|Harvard]], satirized campus radicals, militant student political groups and [[hippie]]s during the [[Vietnam War]] [[Opposition to the US involvement in the Vietnam War|protest era]]. The [[Youth International Party]] (YIP) and [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS) emerged in ''Li'l Abner'' as S.W.I.N.E. (Students Wildly Indignant about Nearly Everything!)\n* Al Capp claimed that he always strove to give incidental characters in ''Li'l Abner'' names that would render all further description unnecessary.  In that spirit, the following list of recurring semi-regulars (and a few one-shots) are unreferenced: '''Tobacco Rhoda, Joan L. Sullivan, Romeo McHaystack, Hamfat Gooch, Global McBlimp, Concertino Constipato, Jinx Rasputinburg, J. Sweetbody Goodpants, Reactionary J. Repugnant, B. Fowler McNest, Fleabrain, Stubborn P. Tolliver, Idiot J. Tolliver, Battling McNoodnik, Mayor Dan'l Dawgmeat, Slobberlips McJab, One-Fault Jones, Swami Riva, Olman Riva, Sir Orble Gasse-Payne, Black Rufe, Mickey Looney, \"Ironpants\" Bailey, Henry Cabbage Cod, Flash Boredom, Priceless and Liceless, Hopeless and Soapless, Disgustin' Jones, Skelton McCloset, Hawg McCall, \"Good old\" Bedly Damp''', and a host of others.\n\n===''Fearless Fosdick''===\n{{Main|Fearless Fosdick}}\n''Li'l Abner'' also featured a comic strip-within-the-strip: ''[[Fearless Fosdick]]'' was a parody of [[Chester Gould]]'s plainclothes detective, ''[[Dick Tracy]]''. It first appeared in 1942, and proved so popular that it ran intermittently in ''Li'l Abner'' over the next 35 years. Gould was also personally parodied in the series as cartoonist '''Lester Gooch''' \u2014 the diminutive, much-harassed and occasionally deranged \"creator\" of ''Fearless Fosdick''. The style of the ''Fosdick'' sequences closely mimicked ''Tracy'', including the urban setting, the outrageous villains, the galloping mortality rate, the crosshatched shadows, the lettering style \u2014 even Gould's familiar signature was parodied in ''Fearless Fosdick''.  Fosdick battled a succession of archenemies with absurdly unlikely names like '''Rattop, Anyface, Bombface, Boldfinger, the Atom Bum, the Chippendale Chair,''' and '''Sidney the Crooked Parrot''', as well as his own criminal mastermind father, '''\"Fearful\" Fosdick''' (aka \"The Original\"). The razor-jawed title character (Li'l Abner's \"ideel\") was perpetually ventilated by flying bullets until he resembled a slice of Swiss cheese.<ref>[http://deniskitchen.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&Category_Code=bios.fosdick Fearless Fosdick \"biography\" at deniskitchen.com]</ref> The impervious Fosdick considered the gaping, smoking holes \"mere scratches,\" however, and always reported back in one piece to his corrupt superior '''The Chief''' for duty the next day.\n\nBesides being fearless, Fosdick was \"pure, underpaid and purposeful,\" according to his creator. He also had notoriously bad aim \u2014 often leaving a trail of [[collateral damage]] (in the form of bullet-riddled pedestrians) in his wake. \"When Fosdick is after a lawbreaker, there is no escape for the miscreant,\" Capp wrote in 1956. \"There is, however, a fighting chance to escape for hundreds of innocent bystanders who happen to be in the neighborhood \u2014 but ''only'' a fighting chance. Fosdick's duty, as he sees it, is not so much to maintain safety as to destroy crime, and it's too much to ask any law-enforcement officer to do both, I suppose.\" Fosdick lived in squalor at the dilapidated boarding house run by his mercenary landlady, '''Mrs. Flintnose'''. He never married his own long-suffering fianc\u00e9e '''Prudence ''(ugh!)'' Pimpleton''' (they've been engaged for 17 years), but Fosdick was directly responsible for the unwitting marriage of his biggest fan, Li'l Abner to Daisy Mae in 1952. The bumbling detective became the star of his own [[NBC-TV]] puppet show that same year. Fosdick also achieved considerable exposure as the long-running advertising spokesman for Wildroot Cream-Oil, a popular men's hair product of the postwar period.\n\n==Setting and fictitious locales==\nAlthough ostensibly set in the Kentucky mountains, situations often took the characters to different destinations \u2014 including New York City, Washington, D.C., Hollywood, the [[Amazon rainforest|South American Amazon]], tropical islands, the Moon, Mars, etc. \u2014 as well as some purely fanciful worlds of Capp's imagination:\n\n===Dogpatch===\nExceeding every [[burlesque]] stereotype of [[Appalachia]], the impoverished backwater of [[Dogpatch]] consisted mostly of hopelessly ramshackle log cabins, \"tarnip\" fields, pine trees and \"hawg\" wallows. Most Dogpatchers were shiftless and ignorant; the remainder were scoundrels and thieves. The menfolk were too lazy to work, yet Dogpatch gals were desperate enough to chase them (see [[Sadie Hawkins Day]]). Those who farmed their turnip fields watched \"turnip termites\" swarm by the billions every year, locust-like, to devour Dogpatch's only crop (along with their homes, their livestock and all their clothing).\n\nThe local geography was fluid and vividly complex; Capp continually changed it to suit either his whims or the current storyline. Natural landmarks included (at various times) Teeterin' Rock, Onneccessary Mountain, Bottomless Canyon, and Kissin' Rock (handy to Suicide Cliff). Local attractions that reappeared in the strip included the West Po'k Chop Railroad; the \"Skonk Works\", a dilapidated factory located on the remote outskirts of Dogpatch; and the General Jubilation T. Cornpone memorial statue.\n\nIn one storyline Dogpatch's \"Cannonball Express\" train, after 1,563 tries, finally delivers its \"cargo\" to Dogpatch citizens \u2014 on Oct 12, 1946! Receiving a 13-year stack of newspapers, Li'l Abner's family realizes that the [[Great Depression]] is on and that banks should close; they race to take their money out of the bank \u2014 before realizing they have no money in the bank! Other news is the inauguration of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] as President on March 4, 1933 (although Mammy Yokam thinks the President is [[Teddy Roosevelt]]) and a picture of Germany's \"new leader\" [[Adolf Hitler]] who claims to love peace while reviewing 20,000 new planes (April 21, 1933); Mammy doesn't trust Hitler but Li'l Abner and Pappy think Hitler is a fine feller \u2014 since Senator Fogbound (Phogbound) says so!\n\nIn the midst of the Great Depression, the hardscrabble residents of lowly Dogpatch allowed suffering Americans to laugh at yokels even worse off than themselves.<ref>[http://deniskitchen.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&Category_Code=bios.dogpatch Dogpatch page at deniskitchen.com]</ref> In Al Capp's own words, Dogpatch was \"an average stone-age community nestled in a bleak valley, between two cheap and uninteresting hills somewhere.\" Early in the continuity Capp a few times referred to Dogpatch being in [[Kentucky]], but he was careful afterwards to keep its location generic, probably to avoid cancellations from offended Kentucky newspapers. From then on, he referred to it as Dogpatch, USA, and did not give any specific location as to exactly where it was supposed to be located. Humorously enough, many states tried to claim ownership to the little town (Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, etc.), yet Capp would not budge. He left it at Dogpatch USA so there would be no headaches and problems. Like the [[Coconino County, Arizona|Coconino County]] depicted in [[George Herriman]]'s ''[[Krazy Kat]]'' and the [[Okefenokee Swamp]] of [[Walt Kelly]]'s ''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]'', Dogpatch's distinctive cartoon landscape became as identified with the strip as any of its characters. Later, Capp licensed and was part-owner of an {{convert|800|acre|km2|adj=on}} $35 million [[theme park]] called [[Dogpatch USA]] near [[Harrison, Arkansas]].\n\n===Lower Slobbovia===\nAs utterly wretched as existence was in Dogpatch, there was one place even worse. Frigid, faraway [[Lower Slobbovia]] was fashioned as a pointedly political satire of backward nations and foreign diplomacy, and remains a contemporary reference.<ref>{{cite news|last=Baker |first=Russell |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/13/opinion/observer-hillary-in-lower-slobbovia.html |title=Hillary in Lower Slobbovia \u2014 '&#39;NY Times'&#39; Jan. 13, 1996 |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1996-01-13 |accessdate=2009-08-29}}</ref> Its hapless residents were perpetually waist-deep in several feet of snow, and icicles hung from almost every frostbitten nose.<ref>[http://deniskitchen.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&Category_Code=bios.slobbovia Lower Slobbovia page at deniskitchen.com]</ref> The favorite dish of the starving natives was raw [[polar bear]] (and vice versa). Lower Slobbovians spoke with burlesque [[pidgin]]-Russian accents; the miserable frozen wasteland of Capp's invention abounded in incongruous [[Yiddish]] humor.\n\nLower Slobbovia and Dogpatch are both comic examples of modern [[dystopian]] satire. Conceptually based on [[Siberia]], or perhaps specifically on [[Birobidzhan]], Capp's icy hellhole made its first appearance in ''Li'l Abner'' in April 1946. Ruled by '''Good King Nogoodnik''' (sometimes known as '''King Stubbornovsky the Last'''), the Slobbovian politicians were even more corrupt than their Dogpatch counterparts. Their monetary unit was the \"rasbucknik,\" of which one was worth nothing and a large quantity was worth a lot less, due to the trouble of carrying them around. The local children were read harrowing tales from \"Ice-sop's Fables,\" which were parodies of classic [[Aesop Fables]], but with a darkly sardonic bent (and titles like \"Coldilocks and the Three Bares\").{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Other fictional locales===\nOther fictional locales included Skonk Hollow, El Passionato, Kigmyland, the Republic of Crumbumbo, Lo Kunning, Faminostan, Planets Pincus Number 2 and 7, Pineapple Junction and, most notably, the Valley of the Shmoon.\n\n==Shmoos and other mythic creatures==\n{{Main|Shmoo}}{{Tone|section|date=October 2017}}\n'''Shmoos''', introduced in 1948, were fabulous creatures that bred exponentially, consumed nothing, and eagerly provided everything that humankind could wish for. Besides producing both milk (bottled, grade A) and eggs (neatly packaged), they tasted like pork when roasted, chicken when fried, and steak when broiled. [[Irony|Ironically]], the shmoo's generous nature and incredible usefulness made it a threat to capitalism, to [[western culture|western society]] and perhaps to civilization itself.<ref>[http://deniskitchen.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&Category_Code=bios.shmoo The Shmoo \"biography\" at deniskitchen.com]</ref> ''Li'l Abner'' featured a whole menagerie of [[allegorical]] animals over the years \u2014 each one was designed to satirically showcase another disturbing aspect of [[human nature]]. They included:\n\n* '''Kigmies''' \u2014 [[Sadomasochism|Masochistic]], aboriginal creatures who loved to be kicked, thereby satisfying all human aggression, up to a point, after which they went on a rampage of retaliation. (The Kigmy story was originally fashioned as a [[metaphor]] for racial and religious oppression. Capp's surviving preliminary sketches of the kigmies make this apparent, as detailed in the introductory notes to ''Li'l Abner Dailies 1949: Volume 15'', Kitchen Sink Press, 1992).\n* '''The Bald Iggle''' \u2014 A cute little wide-eyed, guileless creature whose soulful gaze compelled everyone to involuntarily tell the truth \u2014 including lawyers, politicians, fishermen, advertisers, husbands, wives and used car salesmen. The Iggle was officially declared a public menace by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] (\"The life it ruins may be your own!\"), and ultimately hunted down, confiscated and exterminated.\n* '''Nogoodniks''' \u2014 or ''bad'' shmoos.<ref>[http://scoop.diamondgalleries.com/public/default.asp?t=1&m=1&c=34&s=264&ai=41615&arch=y&ssd=8/24/2002%2012:01:00%20PM ''Bad Shmoos'' from the Scoop Archive \u2014 8/24/2002]</ref> Nogoodniks were a \"sickly shade of green,\" had \"li'l red eyes, sharp yaller teeth, an' a dirty look,\" and were the sworn enemies of \"hoomanity.\" Frequently sporting [[5 o'clock shadow]]s, eye patches, scars, fangs and other ruffian attributes \u2014 they devoured \"good\" shmoos, and wreaked havoc on Dogpatch. They are finally defeated when they get subjected to [[George Jessel (actor)|George Jessel]]'s recording of [[Paul Whiteman]]'s \"Wagon Wheels,\" a sound so excruciating that it kills them instantly. (Similar plot devices were used in the 1978 ''[[Attack of the Killer Tomatoes]]'' and 1996 ''[[Mars Attacks!]]''.)\n* '''Shminfants''' \u2014 Modified baby shmoos, which looked like human babies but were eternally young, came in a variety of different \"colors,\" and never needed changing.\n* '''Shtoonks''' \u2014 Imported from the Slobbovian embassy, Shtoonks were mean-spirited, sharp-toothed, hairy, flying creatures which were \"not only sneaky, smelly and surly, but \u2014 yak! yak! \u2014 just try to eat one!!\" Shtoonks had only one useful trait: they loved human misery so much they actually enjoyed bringing bad news. They temporarily replaced [[postage stamps]] by delivering bills and other bad news for free.\n* '''Mimikniks''' \u2014 Obsessive Slobbovian songbirds who sing like anyone they have ever heard. (Those who have heard [[Maria Callas]] are valued. Those who have heard George Jessel are shot.) The only song they know the words to is ''[[Short'nin' Bread]]'', however, due to the fact that there was only one record in Lower Slobbovia.\n* '''The Money Ha-Ha''' \u2014 An alien creature from \"Planet Pincus No. 2,\" with ears shaped like taxi horns. It laid U.S. currency in place of eggs.\n* '''Turnip Termites''' \u2014 Looking like a cross between a [[locust]] and a [[piranha]], billions of these insatiable pests swarm once a year to their ancient feeding ground, Dogpatch.\n* '''Shminks''' \u2014 Valued for making \"shmink coats.\" They can ''only'' be captured by braining them with a kitchen door.\n* '''Pincushions''' \u2014 Alien beings from \"Planet Pincus No. 7.\" Like the earlier '''Moon Critters''', they looked like flying sausages with pinwheels on their posteriors.\n* '''Abominable Snow-Hams''' \u2014 Delectable but intelligent and sensitive beings, presenting Tiny Yokum with an ethical dilemma: if eating one constitutes [[cannibalism]].\n* '''The Slobbovian Amp-Eater''' \u2014 This luminous beast consumed electric currents; a walking [[energy crisis]].\n* '''Bashful Bulganiks''' \u2014 Timid birds that are so skittish they can not be seen by human eyes, and are thus [[theoretical]].\n* '''Stunflowers''' \u2014 Murderous, thoroughly malevolent [[anthropomorphic]] houseplants; anyone trying to pick their seeds ends up falling into Bottomless Canyon forever.\n* '''Fatoceroses''' \u2014 The ''only'' defense against a stampede of these bloated [[pachyderms]] is a steaming plate of lethally addictive \"Mockaroni.\"\n* '''Bitingales''' \u2014 Small, fiendish devil birds whose hellish bite causes unbearable heat \u2014 for 24 years.\n* '''The Slobbovian King Crab''' \u2014 A huge [[crustacean]] that only eats Slobbovian kings. Later supplemented by a marsupial called the Kingaroo, \"which only eats [Slobbovian] kings\"\n* '''The Flapaloo''' \u2014 A scrawny, prehistoric bird that lays 1,000 eggs per minute. The eggs, when dissolved, turn water into gasoline. The [[Oil industry]] captures the last one in existence, and mercilessly wrings its neck.\n* '''Gobbleglops''' \u2014 Looking like a cross between a hog and a teddy bear, these insatiable creatures eat rubbish (or as Mammy calls it, \"glop\"). They cannot be touched, as they are red-hot, living incinerators; waste goes in and nothing comes out. Mammy leads them to America's major polluted cities, where they obligingly devour all the garbage.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,910181-3,00.html \"The Comics on the Couch\" by Gerald Clarke, ''Time'' Dec. 13, 1971]</ref> But when the glop runs out \u2014 they begin to consume everything (and ''everyone'') else in sight.\n* '''Shmeagles''' \u2014 The world's most amorous creatures, they pursue their females at the [[speed of light]] \u2014 sometimes even faster.\n* '''Hammus Alabammus''' \u2014 Faux Latin designation for an adorable (and delectable) species of swine, with a \"zoot snoot\" and a \"drape shape.\" The only known female<ref>[[Salomey]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=November 2017}}in existence resides with the Yokums \u2014 their beloved pet, Salomey.\n\n==Dialogue and catchphrases==\nAl Capp, a native [[northeastern United States|northeasterner]], wrote all the final dialogue in ''Li'l Abner'' using his approximation of a mock-[[southern United States|southern]] [[dialect]] (including [[phonetic]] sounds, [[eye dialect]] (nonstandard spelling for speech to draw attention to pronunciation), nonstop \"creative\" spelling and deliberate [[malapropisms]]). He constantly interspersed [[boldface]] type, and included prompt words in parentheses (''chuckle!, sob!, gasp!, shudder!, smack!, drool!, cackle!, snort!, gulp!, blush!, ugh!,'' etc.) as asides, to bolster the effect of the printed [[speech balloons]]. Almost every line was followed by ''two'' exclamation marks for added emphasis.\n\nOutside Dogpatch, characters used a variety of stock [[Vaudevillian]] dialects. [[Organized crime|Mobsters]] and criminal-types invariably spoke slangy [[Brooklynese]], and residents of Lower Slobbovia spoke pidgin-Russian, with a smattering of [[Yinglish]]. Comic dialects were also devised for offbeat British characters \u2014 like '''H'Inspector Blugstone''' of [[Scotland Yard]] (who had a [[Cockney]] accent) and '''Sir Cecil Cesspool''' (whose speech was a clipped, uppercrust [[Received Pronunciation|King's English]]). Various [[Asian people|Asian]], [[Latin Americans|Latin]], [[Native Americans in the US|Native American]] and [[ethnic groups in Europe|European]] characters spoke in a wide range of specific, broadly caricatured dialects as well. Capp has credited his inspiration for vividly stylized language to early literary influences like [[Charles Dickens]], [[Mark Twain]] and [[Damon Runyon]], as well as [[Old-time radio]] and the Burlesque stage.\n\nComics historian [[Don Markstein]] commented that Capp's \"use of language was both unique and universally appealing; and his clean, bold cartooning style provided a perfect vehicle for his creations.\"<ref name=toonopedia />\n\nThe following is a partial list of characteristic expressions that reappeared often in ''Li'l Abner:''\n* \"Natcherly!\"\n* \"Amoozin' but confoozin'!\"\n* \"Yo' big, sloppy ''beast!!\"'' (also, \"Yo' mizzable ''skonk!!\"'')\n* \"Ef Ah had mah druthers, Ah'd druther...\"\n* \"As any fool kin plainly see!\"  (Response: \"''Ah'' sees!\")\n* \"What's good for General Bullmoose is good for ''everybody!\"'' (Variant from the movie: \"...good for the USA!\")\n* \"Thar's no Jack S. like ''our'' Jack S!\"\n* \"Oh, happy day!\"\n* \"Th' ideel o' ev'ry one hunnerd percent, red-blooded American boy!\"\n* \"Ah'll ''bash'' yore ''haid'' in!!\"\n* \"Wal, fry mah hide!\"  (also, \"Wal, cuss mah bones!\")\n* \"Ah has ''spoken!\"''\n* \"Good is better than evil becuz it's ''nicer!\"''\n* \"It hain't ''hoomin'', thass whut it hain't!\"\n\n==Toppers and alternate strips==\n''Li'l Abner'' had several [[topper (comic strip)|toppers]] on the Sunday page, including<ref name=Holtz/>\n\n* ''Washable Jones'' (Feb 24 - June 9, 1935)\n* ''Advice fo' Chillun'', aka ''Advice fo' Gals'', ''Advice fo' Parents'', ''Advice fo' Yo' All'' and other titles (June 23, 1935 \u2013 Aug 15, 1943)\n* ''Small Change'', aka ''Small Fry'' (May 31, 1942 - 1944)\n\nThe Sunday page debuted six months into the run of the strip.

After this, Capp simply expanded ''Li'l Abner'' by another row, and filled the rest of the space with a page-wide title panel and a small panel called ''Advice fo' Chillun''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Holtz |first1=Allan |title=Toppers: Washable Jones |url=http://strippersguide.blogspot.com/2018/02/toppers-washable-jones.html |website=Stripper's Guide |accessdate=9 July 2019}}</ref> Washable Jones later appeared in the strip in a Shmoo-related storyline in 1949, and he appeared with the Shmoos in two one-shot comics -- ''Al Capp's Shmoo in Washable Jones' Travels'' (1950, a premium for [[Oxydol]] laundry detergent) and ''Washable Jones and the Shmoo'' #1 (1953, published by the Capp-owned publisher Toby Press).\n\nAl Capp also wrote two other daily comic strips:<ref name=Holtz />\n\n* ''[[Abbie an' Slats]]'', drawn by [[Raeburn van Buren]] (July 12, 1937 - January 30, 1971)\n* ''[[Long Sam]]'', drawn by [[Bob Lubbers]] (May 31, 1954 \u2013 December 29, 1962)\n\n==Licensing, advertising and promotion==\nAl Capp was a master of the arts of marketing and [[promotion (marketing)|promotion]]. Publicity campaigns were devised to boost circulation and increase public visibility of ''Li'l Abner'', often coordinating with national magazines, radio and television. In 1946 Capp persuaded six of the most popular radio personalities (Frank Sinatra, [[Kate Smith]], [[Danny Kaye]], [[Bob Hope]], [[Fred Waring]] and [[Smilin' Jack Smith]]) to broadcast a song he'd written for Daisy Mae: ''(Li'l Abner) Don't Marry That Girl!!''<ref>''Anything Can Happen in a Comic Strip: Centennial Reflections on an American Art Form'' by M. Thomas Inge (1995) Univ. Press of Mississippi, pg. 21</ref> Other promotional tie-ins included the Lena the Hyena Contest (1946), the Name the Shmoo Contest (1949), the Nancy O. Contest (1951), the Roger the Lodger Contest (1964) and many others.\n\nCapp also excelled at product endorsement, and ''Li'l Abner'' characters were often featured in mid-century American [[advertising campaign]]s. Dogpatch characters pitched consumer products as varied as [[Grape-Nuts|Grape-Nuts cereal]], [[Kraft Foods|Kraft caramels]], [[Ivory soap]], [[Oxydol]], [[List of Procter & Gamble brands|Duz]] and [[Dreft]] detergents, [[Fruit of the Loom]], [[Orange Crush]], [[Nestl\u00e9|Nestl\u00e9's cocoa]], Cheney neckties, Pedigree pencils, Strunk chainsaws, U.S. Royal tires, [[Head & Shoulders|Head & Shoulders shampoo]] and [[General Electric]] light bulbs. There were even Dogpatch-themed family restaurants called \"Li'l Abner's\" in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], [[Morton Grove, Illinois]] and [[Seattle, Washington]].\n\nCapp himself appeared in numerous print ads. A lifelong chain-smoker, he happily plugged [[Chesterfield cigarettes]]; he appeared in Schaeffer fountain pen ads with his friends [[Milton Caniff]] and [[Walt Kelly]]; pitched the [[Famous Artists School]] (in which he had a financial interest) along with Caniff, [[Rube Goldberg]], [[Virgil Partch]], [[Willard Mullin]] and [[Whitney Darrow, Jr]]; and, though a professed [[teetotaler]], he personally endorsed [[Rheingold Beer]], among other products.\n\n* '''Cream of Wheat:''' Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, Li'l Abner was the spokesman for [[Cream of Wheat]] cereal in a long-running series of comic strip-format ads that appeared in national magazines including ''Life'', ''[[Good Housekeeping]]'', and ''[[Ladies' Home Journal]]''. The ads usually featured Daisy Mae calling for \"halp\" against a threatening menace \u2014 in the person of Earthquake McGoon or, just as often, a gorilla, grizzly bear, rampaging moose, \"Injun\" attack, or some natural disaster like an avalanche, fire or flood. Abner is dispatched to rescue her, but not before enjoying a \"dee-lishus\" enriched bowl of hot Cream of Wheat which, the reader is assured, is \"ready in just 5 minutes!\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gogd.tjs-labs.com/gallery-view?keyword=LIL*ABNER |title=Gallery of vintage ads featuring Li'l Abner as spokesman |publisher=TJS Labs Gallery of Graphic Design |date= |accessdate=2009-08-29}}</ref>\n* '''Wildroot Cream-Oil:''' ''Fearless Fosdick'' was licensed for use in an advertising campaign for Wildroot Cream-Oil, a popular men's hair tonic. Fosdick's iconic profile on tin signs and advertising displays became a prominent fixture in barbershops across America \u2014 advising readers to \"Get Wildroot Cream-Oil, Charlie!\" A series of ads appeared in newspapers, magazines and comic books featuring Fosdick's farcical battles with \"Anyface\" \u2014 a murderous master of disguise. (Anyface was ''always'' given away by his telltale [[dandruff]] and messy hair, however.)\n* '''Toys and licensed merchandise:''' Dogpatch characters were heavily licensed throughout the 1940s and 1950s: the main cast was produced as a set of six handpuppets and {{convert|14|in|mm|adj=on}} dolls by Baby Barry Toys in 1957. A 10-figure set of carnival [[chalkware]] statues of Dogpatch characters was manufactured by Artrix Products in 1951, and Topstone introduced a line of 16 rubber Halloween masks prior to 1960. Licensing would reach an apex, however, with the unexpected postwar merchandising phenomenon that followed Capp's introduction of the Shmoo. As in the strip, shmoos suddenly appeared to be everywhere in 1948 and 1949. A garment factory in [[Baltimore]] turned out a whole line of shmoo apparel \u2014 including \"Shmooveralls.\" Shmoo dolls, clocks, watches, jewelry, earmuffs, wallpaper, fishing lures, air fresheners, soap, ice cream, balloons, ashtrays, comic books, records, sheet music, toys, games, Halloween masks, salt and pepper shakers, decals, pinbacks, tumblers, coin banks, greeting cards, planters, neckties, suspenders, belts, curtains, fountain pens, and other shmoo paraphernalia were produced. In a single year, shmoo merchandise generated over $25 million in sales. Close to a hundred licensed shmoo products from 75 different manufacturers were produced, some of which sold five million units each.<ref>''Newsweek'' September 5, 1949 and ''Editor & Publisher'' July 16, 1949</ref> More recently, Dark Horse Comics issued four figures of Abner, Daisy Mae, Fosdick and the Shmoo in 2000 as part of their line of Classic Comic Characters \u2014 statues #8, 9, 17 and 31, respectively.\n* '''[[Kickapoo Joy Juice]]:''' The lethal brew known as Kickapoo Joy Juice, featured in the strip and characterized as moonshine or bootleg liquor (it could also remove hair, paint and tattoos) has been a licensed brand in real-life since 1965. The National [[NuGrape]] Company first produced the beverage, which was acquired in 1968 by the [[Moxie]] Company, and eventually the [[Monarch Beverage Company]] of Atlanta, Ga. As with [[Mountain Dew]], another euphemism for moonshine, the actual product is a soft-drink. To this day the label features Capp's characters Hairless Joe and Lonesome Polecat. Distribution currently includes the United States, Canada, Singapore, Bangladesh, China, [[Pakistan]], Malaysia, [[Mongolia]], Brunei, [[Indonesia]] and [[Thailand]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kickapoojoy.com/ |title=Official website of Kickapoo Joy Juice |publisher=Kickapoojoy.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805183841/http://www.kickapoojoy.com/ |archive-date=2009-08-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* '''Dogpatch USA:''' In 1968, an {{convert|800|acre|km2|adj=on}} $35 million [[theme park]] called [[Dogpatch USA]] opened at [[Marble Falls, Arkansas]], based on Capp's work and with his support. The gift shops sold \"hillbilly\" souvenirs like corncob pipes and moonshine jugs. In addition to the newly constructed rides and attractions, many of the buildings in the park were authentic 19th century log structures purchased by general manager James H. Schermerhorn. The logs in each building were numbered, catalogued, disassembled and reassembled at the park. Dogpatch USA was a popular attraction during the 1970s, but was closed in 1993 due to mismanagement and financial difficulties. Several attempts have been made to reopen the park but at present it lies abandoned. As of late 2005, the area once devoted to a live-action facsimile of Dogpatch (including a lifesize statue in the town square of Dogpatch \"founder\" Jubilation T. Cornpone) has been heavily stripped by vandals and souvenir hunters, and is today slowly being reclaimed by the surrounding Arkansas wilderness.  It was announced that Dogpatch will reopen as Heritage USA in October, 2018.<ref>http://www.4029tv.com/article/dogpatch-usa-site-to-reopen-as-heritage-usa/19464766</ref>\n\n==Awards and recognition==\n{{cquote|''Li'l Abner'' was a comic strip with fire in its belly and a brain in its head.|30|30| John Updike, from ''My Well-Balanced Life on a Wooden Leg'' (1991)}}\n\nFans of the strip ranged from novelist [[John Steinbeck]], who called Capp \"very possibly the best writer in the world today\" in 1953, and even earnestly recommended him for the Nobel Prize in literature \u2014 to media critic and theorist [[Marshall McLuhan]], who considered Capp \"the only robust satirical force in American life.\" [[John Updike]], calling Li'l Abner a \"hillbilly [[Candide]],\" added that the strip's \"richness of social and philosophical commentary approached the [[Voltairean]].\"<ref>[http://www.city-journal.org/2010/20_2_urb-al-capp.html Exile in Dogpatch: The Curious Neglect of Cartoonist Al Capp, ''City Journal,'' Spring 2010]</ref> Capp has been compared, at various times, to [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]], [[Jonathan Swift]], [[Lawrence Sterne]], and [[Rabelais]].<ref>Brown, Rodger, \"Dogpatch USA: The Road to Hokum\" article, ''Southern Changes: The Journal of the Southern Regional Council'', Vol. 15, No. 3, 1993, pp. 18\u201326</ref> ''Journalism Quarterly'' and ''Time'' have both called him \"the [[Mark Twain]] of cartoonists.\" [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[William F.

In 2002 the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', in a review of ''The Short Life and Happy Times of the Shmoo'', noted: \"The wry, ornery, brilliantly perceptive satirist will go down as one of the Great American Humorists.\" In ''America's Great Comic Strip Artists'' (1997), comics historian [[Rick Marschall|Richard Marschall]] analyzed the overtly [[misanthropic]] [[subtext]] of ''Li'l Abner:''\n\n{{quote|Capp was calling society absurd, not just silly; [[human nature]] not simply misguided, but irredeemably and irreducibly corrupt. Unlike any other strip, and indeed unlike many other pieces of literature, ''Li'l Abner'' was more than a satire of the human condition. It was a commentary on human nature itself.}}\n\n''Li'l Abner'' was also the subject of the first book-length, scholarly assessment of a comic strip ever published. ''Li'l Abner: A Study in American Satire'' by [[Arthur Asa Berger]] (Twayne, 1969) contained serious analyses of Capp's narrative technique, his use of dialogue, self-caricature and grotesquerie, the strip's overall place in American satire, and the significance of social criticism and the graphic image. \"One of the few strips ever taken seriously by students of American culture,\" wrote Professor Berger, \"''Li'l Abner'' is worth studying...because of Capp's imagination and artistry, and because of the strip's very obvious social relevance.\" It was reprinted by the [[University Press of Mississippi]] in 1994.\n\nAl Capp's life and career are the subjects of a new life-sized [[mural]] commemorating his 100th birthday, displayed in downtown [[Amesbury, Massachusetts]].<ref>[http://www.newburyportnews.com/local/x1612544031/Town-to-honor-famous-cartoonist-who-lived-worked-in-Amesbury#comment-45683673 Town to Honor Famous Cartoonist Who Lived, Worked in Amesbury ''Newburyport Daily News'' April 20, 2010]</ref><ref>[http://www.boston.com/ae/theater_arts/articles/2010/05/15/amesbury_gives_lil_abner_his_due/?page=full Amesbury Gives Li'l Abner His Due ''Boston Globe'' May 15, 2010]</ref> According to the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' (as reported on May 18, 2010), the town has renamed its amphitheater in the artist's honor, and is looking to develop an Al Capp Museum.

It made its debut in ''Li'l Abner'' on November 15, 1937. Capp originally created it as a comic plot device, but in 1939, only two years after its inauguration, a double-page spread in ''Life'' proclaimed, \"On Sadie Hawkins Day Girls Chase Boys in 201 Colleges.\" By the early 1940s the comic strip event had swept the nation's imagination and acquired a life of its own. By 1952, the event was reportedly celebrated at 40,000 known venues. It became a woman-empowering rite at high schools and college campuses, long before the modern feminist movement gained prominence.\n\nOutside the comic strip, the practical basis of a [[Sadie Hawkins dance]] is simply one of gender [[role-reversal]]. Women and girls take the initiative in inviting the man or boy of their choice out on a date \u2014 almost unheard of before 1937 \u2014 typically to a dance attended by other bachelors and their assertive dates. When Capp created the event, it wasn't his intention to have it occur annually on a specific date, because it inhibited his freewheeling plotting. However, due to its enormous popularity and the numerous fan letters he received, Capp made it a tradition in the strip every November, lasting four decades. In many localities the tradition continues.\n\n===Additions to the language===\nSadie Hawkins Day and Sadie Hawkins dance are two of several terms attributed to Al Capp that have entered the English language. Others include [[:wikt:double whammy|double whammy]], [[skunk works]] and [[Lower Slobbovia]]. The term ''[[shmoo]]'' has also entered the lexicon \u2014 used in defining highly technical concepts in no fewer than ''four'' separate fields of science.<ref>[http://hoodedutilitarian.com/2010/12/strange-windows-keeping-up-with-the-goonses-part-3/ The Hooded Utilitarian: Comics\u2019 contributions to colloquial English, 18 December 2010]</ref>\n\n* In [[socioeconomics]], a \"shmoo\" refers to any generic kind of good that reproduces itself (as opposed to \"[[widget (economics)|widgets]]\" which require resources and active production).\n* In [[microbiology]], \"shmooing\" is the biological term used for the \"budding\" process in [[yeast]] reproduction. The cellular bulge produced by a [[haploid]] yeast cell towards a cell of the opposite mating type during the [[mating of yeast]] is referred to as a \"shmoo,\" due to its structural resemblance to the cartoon character.\n* In the field of [[particle physics]], \"shmoo\" refers to a high energy survey instrument \u2013 as utilized at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] for the [[Cygnus X-3]] Sky Survey performed at the LAMPF ([[Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility]]) grounds. Over one hundred white \"shmoo\" detectors were at one time sprinkled around the accelerator beamstop area and adjacent mesa to capture subatomic [[cosmic ray]] particles emitted from the [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]] [[constellation]]. The detectors housed [[scintillator]]s and [[photomultiplier]]s in an array that gave the detector its distinctive shmoo shape.\n* In [[electrical engineering]], a [[shmoo plot]] is the technical term used for the graphic pattern of test circuits. (The term is also used as a verb: to \"shmoo\" means to run the test.)\n\nCapp has also been credited with popularizing many terms, such as \"natcherly,\" [[schmooze]], [[list of American words not widely used in the United Kingdom|druthers]], and nogoodnik, neatnik, etc. (In his book ''[[The American Language]]'', [[H.L. Mencken]] credits the postwar mania for adding \"[[-nik]]\" to the ends of adjectives to create nouns as beginning \u2014 not with [[beatnik]] or [[Sputnik]], but earlier \u2014 in the pages of ''Li'l Abner''.)\n\n===Franchise ownership and creators' rights===\nIn the late 1940s, newspaper syndicates typically owned the [[copyrights]], trademarks and [[licensing]] rights to comic strips. \"Capp was an aggressive and fearless businessman,\" according to publisher [[Denis Kitchen]].  \"Nearly all comic strips, even today, are owned and controlled by syndicates, ''not'' the strips' creators. And virtually all cartoonists remain content with their diluted share of any merchandising revenue their syndicates arrange. When the starving and broke Capp first sold ''Li'l Abner'' in 1934, he gladly accepted the syndicate's standard onerous contract. But in 1947 Capp sued United Feature Syndicate for $14 million, publicly embarrassed UFS in ''Li'l Abner'', and wrested ownership and control of his creation the following year.\"<ref name=Kitchen />\n\nIn October 1947, Li'l Abner met '''Rockwell P. Squeezeblood''', head of the abusive and corrupt Squeezeblood Syndicate, a thinly veiled dig at UFS. The resulting sequence, \"Jack Jawbreaker Fights Crime!!,\" was a devastating satire of [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]]'s notorious exploitation by [[DC Comics]] over ''[[Superman]]'' (see above excerpt). It was later reprinted in ''The World of Li'l Abner'' (1953).\n\nIn 1964, Capp left United Features and took ''Li'l Abner'' to the [[Chicago Tribune New York News Syndicate]].<ref>Harvey, R.C.

The NCS had originally disallowed female members into its ranks. In 1949, when the all-male club refused membership to [[Hilda Terry]], creator of the comic strip ''[[Teena]]'', Capp temporarily resigned in protest. \"Capp had always advocated a more activist agenda for the Society, and he had begun in December 1949 to make his case in the Newsletter as well as at the meetings,\" wrote comics historian [[R. C. Harvey]].<ref>[http://classic.tcj.com/history/tales-of-the-founding-of-the-national-cartoonists-society-part-iii/ TCJ.com: \"Tales of the Founding of the National Cartoonists Society Part III\" from ''Meanwhile...: A Biography of Milton Caniff'' by R.C. Harvey, Fantagraphics (2007)]</ref> According to Tom Roberts, author of ''[[Alex Raymond]]: His Life and Art'' (2007), Capp authored a stirring [[monologue]] that was instrumental in changing the restrictive rules the following year. Hilda Terry was the first woman cartoonist to break the gender barrier when the NCS finally permitted female members in 1950.\n\n===Social commentary in comic strips===\nThrough ''Li'l Abner'', the American comic strip achieved unprecedented relevance in the postwar years, attracting new readers who were more intellectual, more informed on current events, and less likely to read the comics (according to [[Coulton Waugh]], author of ''The Comics'', 1947). \"When ''Li'l Abner'' made its debut in 1934, the vast majority of comic strips were designed chiefly to amuse or thrill their readers. Capp turned that world upside-down by routinely injecting politics and [[social commentary]] into ''Li'l Abner'',\" wrote comics historian [[Rick Marschall]] in ''America's Great Comic Strip Artists'' (1989). With adult readers far outnumbering juveniles, ''Li'l Abner'' forever cleared away the concept that humor strips were solely the domain of adolescents and children. ''Li'l Abner'' provided a whole new template for contemporary satire and personal expression in comics, paving the way for ''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]'', ''[[jules Feiffer|Feiffer]]'', ''[[Doonesbury]]'' and ''[[Mad magazine|MAD]]''.\n\n===''Mad''===\n''Fearless Fosdick'' and other ''Li'l Abner'' comic strip parodies, such as \"Jack Jawbreaker!\" (1947) and \"Little Fanny Gooney\" (1952), were almost certainly an inspiration to [[Harvey Kurtzman]] when he created his irreverent ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'', which began in 1952 as a comic book that specifically parodied other comics in the same subversive manner. By the time [[EC Comics]] published ''Mad #1'', Capp had been doing ''Fearless Fosdick'' for nearly a decade. Similarities between ''Li'l Abner'' and the early ''Mad'' include the incongruous use of mock-[[Yiddish]] slang terms, the nose-thumbing disdain for [[popular culture|pop culture]] icons, the rampant [[black humor]], the dearth of sentiment and the broad visual styling. Even the trademark comic \"signs\" that clutter the backgrounds of [[Will Elder]]'s panels had a precedent in ''Li'l Abner'', in the residence of Dogpatch ''entrepreneur'' Available Jones, though they're also reminiscent of Bill Holman's ''[[Smokey Stover]]''. Tellingly, Kurtzman resisted doing feature parodies of either ''Li'l Abner'' or ''Dick Tracy'' in the comic book ''Mad'', despite their prominence.\n\n{{cquote|Capp is one of the great unsung heroes of comics. I've never heard anyone mention this, but Capp is 100% responsible for inspiring Harvey Kurtzman to create ''Mad'' Magazine. Just look at ''Fearless Fosdick'' \u2014 a brilliant parody of ''Dick Tracy'' with all those bullet holes and stuff. Then look at ''Mad''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s \"Teddy and the Pirates,\" \"[[Superduperman!]]\" or even ''[[Little Annie Fanny]]''. Forget about it \u2014 ''slam dunk!'' Not taking anything away from Kurtzman, who was brilliant himself, but Capp was the source for that whole sense of satire in comics. Kurtzman carried that forward and passed it down to a whole new crop of cartoonists, myself included. Capp was a ''genius''. You wanna argue about it?

Both the ''Trump'' and ''Panic'' parodies were drawn by EC legend, Will Elder. In 1947, [[Will Eisner]]'s ''[[The Spirit]]'' satirized the comic strip business in general, as a denizen of Central City tries to murder cartoonist \"Al Slapp,\" creator of \"Li'l Adam.\" Capp was also caricatured as an ill-mannered, boozy cartoonist (Capp was a [[teetotaler]] in real life) named \"Hal Rapp\" in the comic strip ''[[Mary Worth]]'' by [[Allen Saunders]] and [[Ken Ernst]]. Supposedly done in retaliation for Capp's \"Mary Worm\" parody in ''Li'l Abner'' (1956), a media-fed \"feud\" commenced briefly between the rival strips. It all turned out to be a collaborative [[hoax]], however \u2014 cooked up by Capp and his longtime pal Saunders as an elaborate [[publicity stunt]].\n\n''Li'l Abner'''s success also sparked a handful of comic strip imitators. ''Jasper Jooks'' by Jess \"Baldy\" Benton (1948\u2013'49), ''Ozark Ike'' (1945\u2013'53) and ''Cotton Woods'' (1955\u2013'58), both by Ray Gotto, were clearly inspired by Capp's strip. [[Boody Rogers]]' ''Babe'' was a peculiar series of comic books about a beautiful hillbilly girl who lived with her kin in the [[Ozarks]] \u2014 with many similarities to ''Li'l Abner''. A derivative hillbilly feature called ''Looie Lazybones'', an out-and-out imitation (drawn by a young [[Frank Frazetta]]) ran in several issues of Standard's ''[[Thrilling Comics]]'' in the late 1940s. [[Charlton Comics|Charlton]] published the short-lived ''Hillbilly Comics'' by Art Gates in 1955, featuring \"Gumbo Galahad,\" who was a dead ringer for Li'l Abner, as was ''Pokey Oakey'' by Don Dean, which ran in [[MLJ]]'s ''[[Top-Notch Comics|Top-Notch Laugh]]'' and ''[[Pep Comics]]''. Later, many fans and critics saw [[Paul Henning]]'s popular TV sitcom, ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'' (1962\u2013'71) as owing much of its inspiration to ''Li'l Abner'', prompting [[Alvin Toffler]] to ask Capp about the similarities in a 1965 ''[[Playboy]]'' interview.\n\n==Popularity and production==\n[[File:Li'l Abner 3 -29-1947 Excerpt.png|thumb|350px|right|\"But, cuss it, Ah is still alive!!\" Li'l Abner, Daisy Mae, Mammy, Salomey and Pappy survive another narrow scrape in this strip excerpt from March 29, 1947.]]\n''Li'l Abner'' made its debut on August 13, 1934 in eight North American newspapers, including the ''[[New York Mirror]].'' Initially owned and syndicated through [[United Feature Syndicate]], a division of the [[E.W. Scripps Company]], it was an immediate success. According to publisher Denis Kitchen, Capp's \"hapless Dogpatchers hit a nerve in [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era America. Within three years ''Abner's'' circulation climbed to 253 newspapers, reaching over 15,000,000 readers. Before long he was in hundreds more, with a total readership exceeding 60,000,000.\"<ref name=Kitchen>{{cite web|author=Denis Kitchen Publishing Co LLC |url=http://deniskitchen.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&Category_Code=bios.capp |title=Al Capp biography by Denis Kitchen |publisher=Deniskitchen.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-29}}</ref> At its peak, the strip was read daily by 70 million Americans (when the U.S. population was only 180 million), with a circulation of more than 900 newspapers in North America and Europe.\n\nDuring the extended peak of the strip, the workload grew to include advertising, merchandising, promotional work, comic book adaptations, public service material and other specialty work \u2014 in addition to the regular six dailies and one Sunday strip per week. Capp had a platoon of assistants in later years, who worked under his direct supervision. They included Andy Amato, Harvey Curtis, Walter Johnson and, notably, a young [[Frank Frazetta]], who penciled the Sunday continuity from studio roughs from 1954 to the end of 1961 \u2014 before his fame as a fantasy artist.\n\nSensitive to his own experience working on ''[[Joe Palooka]]'', Capp frequently drew attention to his assistants in interviews and publicity pieces. A 1950 cover story in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' even included photos of two of his employees, whose roles in the production were detailed by Capp. Ironically, this highly irregular policy has led to the misconception that his strip was \"ghosted\" by other hands. The production of ''Li'l Abner'' has been well documented, however. In point of fact, Capp maintained creative control over every stage of production for virtually the entire run of the strip. Capp himself originated the stories, wrote the dialogue, designed the major characters, rough penciled the preliminary staging and action of each panel, oversaw the finished pencils, and drew and inked the faces and hands of the characters. \"He had ''the touch,''\" Frazetta said of Capp in 2008. \"He knew how to take an otherwise ordinary drawing and really make it ''pop''. I'll never knock his talent.\"<ref>Mason, Edward (ed.), ''Telling Stories: The Comic Art of Frank Frazetta'' (Underwood Books, 2008) pp. 14\u201317.</ref>\n\n{{cquote|Many have commented on the shift in Capp's political viewpoint, from as liberal as ''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]'' in his early years to as conservative as ''[[Little Orphan Annie]]'' when he reached middle age. At one extreme, he displayed consistently devastating humor, while at the other, his mean-spiritedness came to the fore \u2014 but which was which seems to depend on the commentator's ''own'' point of view. From beginning to end, Capp was acid-tongued toward the targets of his wit, intolerant of hypocrisy, and always wickedly funny. After about 40 years, however, Capp's interest in ''Abner'' waned, and this showed in the strip itself...|30|30|Don Markstein's ''Toonopedia''}}\n\n''Li'l Abner'' lasted until November 13, 1977, when Capp retired with an apology to his fans for the recently declining quality of the strip, which he said had been the best he could manage due to advancing illness. \"If you have any sense of humor about your strip \u2014 and I had a sense of humor about mine \u2014 you knew that for three or four years ''Abner'' was wrong. Oh hell, it's like a fighter retiring. I stayed on longer than I should have,\" he admitted.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,948819,00.html |title=Mr. Dogpatch\u2014 1979 '&#39;Time'&#39; obituary |publisher=Time.com |date=1979-11-19 |accessdate=2009-08-29}}</ref>  \"When he retired ''Li'l Abner'', newspapers ran expansive articles and television commentators talked about the passing of an era. ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine ran a substantial feature, and even the comics-free ''[[New York Times]]'' devoted nearly a full page to the event,\" according to publisher Denis Kitchen. Capp, a lifelong chain smoker, died from [[emphysema]] two years later at age 70, at his home in [[South Hampton, New Hampshire]] on November 5, 1979.\n\nIn 1988 and 1989 many newspapers ran reruns of ''Li'l Abner'' episodes, mostly from the 1940s run, distributed by [[Newspaper Enterprise Association]] and Capp Enterprises. Following the 1989 revival of the ''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]'' comic strip, a revival of ''Li'l Abner'' was also planned in 1990. Drawn by cartoonist [[Steve Stiles]],<ref>[http://stevestiles.com/capp.htm Passing Through Dogpatch: Al Capp's ''Li'l Abner'' by Steve Stiles]</ref> the new ''Abner'' was approved by Capp's widow and brother, [[Elliott Caplin]], but Al Capp's daughter, Julie Capp, objected at the last minute and permission was withdrawn.\n\n==''Li'l Abner'' in other media==\n\n===Radio and recordings===\nWith [[John Hodiak]] in the title role, the ''Li'l Abner'' [[radio serial]] ran weekdays on [[NBC]] from Chicago, from November 20, 1939 to December 6, 1940.

[[Durwood Kirby]] was the announcer. The radio show was not written by Al Capp \u2014 but by Charles Gussman. However, Gussman consulted closely with Capp on the storylines. (A familiar radio personality, Capp was frequently heard on the NBC broadcast series, ''[[Monitor (NBC radio)|Monitor]].''

''Fearless Fosdick'' premiered on Sunday afternoons on NBC; 13 episodes featuring the Mary Chase [[marionettes]] were produced.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0389616/epcast Fearless Fosdick (TV show) at IMDB]</ref>  The storylines and villains were mostly separate from the comic strip and unique to the show.

Nevertheless, when it was secretly completed in April 1952 it was the \"most sophisticated computer of its time.\"<ref>''[[Body of Secrets]]: Anatomy of the Ultra-Secret National Security Agency'' (Anchor Books, 2002) by [[James Bamford]].</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n* The 1989 film ''I Want to Go Home'' (''Je Veux Rentrer a la Maison,'' screenplay by [[Jules Feiffer]]) has a scene where the main character, a retired cartoonist played by [[Adolph Green]], makes an unexpectedly emotional appeal for Al Capp and his legacy.\n* The original Dogpatch is a historical part of San Francisco dating back to the 1860s that escaped the [[San Francisco earthquake|earthquake and fire of 1906]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pier70sf.org/dogpatch/dogpatch_history.htm |title=Pier 70 |publisher=Pier70sf.org |date= |accessdate=2009-08-29}}</ref> \n* Later in the 20th century, [[U.S. Army]] and [[Marine Corps]] units in [[Vietnam]] during the [[Vietnam War]] called their housing compounds \"Dogpatches,\" due to the primitive living conditions.\n* Li'l Abner, Daisy Mae, Wolf Gal, Earthquake McGoon, Lonesome Polecat, Hairless Joe, Sadie Hawkins, Silent Yokum and Fearless Fosdick all found their way onto the [[nose art|painted noses]] of [[bomber aircraft]] during World War II and the [[Korean War]], as did Kickapoo Joy Juice, Lena the Hyena and the Shmoo. Moonbeam McSwine was immortalized as the [[P-51D Mustang]] [[USAAF]] [[bomber escort]] fighter flown by ace pilot Capt. [[William T. Whisner]], still operable and appearing in aviator [[air show]]s as of 2008.\n* Al Capp always claimed to have effectively created the [[miniskirt]], when he first put one on Daisy Mae in 1934.\n* ''Li'l Abner'' was [[censorship|censored]] for the first, but not the last time in September 1947, and was pulled from papers by [[Scripps-Howard]]. The controversy, as reported in ''Time'', centered on Capp's portrayal of the [[US Senate]]. Said Edward Leech of Scripps, \"We don't think it is good editing or sound citizenship to picture the Senate as an assemblage of freaks and crooks... boobs and undesirables.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,804275,00.html |title=Tain't Funny \u2014 '&#39;Time'&#39; |publisher=Time.com |date=1947-09-29 |accessdate=2009-08-29}}</ref>\n* Li'l Abner has one odd design quirk that has puzzled readers for decades: the part in his hair always faces the viewer, no matter which direction Abner is facing. In response to the question \"Which side does Abner part his hair on?,\" Capp would answer, \"Both.\" Capp claimed that he found the right \"look\" for Li'l Abner with [[Henry Fonda]]'s character Dave Tolliver in ''[[The Trail of the Lonesome Pine (1936 film)|The Trail of the Lonesome Pine]]'' (1936). Fonda later commented, \"He's never told me, but I was told he has said that.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/details/hollywoodspeaks00mike <!-- quote=fonda \"li'l abner\". --> Steen, Mike. ''Hollywood Speaks: An Oral History''. Putnam, 1974.]</ref>\n* [[Joan Baez]] took Al Capp to court in 1967 over Joanie Phoanie. She did not ask for damages; it was instead a bid to force a public retraction. The judge decided in Capp's favor, however. Declaring that satire was also protected [[free speech]], he refused to order Capp to cease and desist.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,843312,00.html |title=\"Which One Is the Phoanie?\" '&#39;Time'&#39; Jan. 20, 1967 |publisher=Time.com |date=1967-01-20 |accessdate=2009-08-29}}</ref> In recent years, Baez has admitted to being more amused by the parody \u2014 even including an excerpt in her memoirs (''And a Voice to Sing With: A Memoir'', published in 1987). \"I wish I could have laughed at this at the time,\" she wrote in a caption under one of the strips.\n* \"I didn't start this Mammy Yokum did.\" was the reply Ralph Kramden told his wife Alice (concerning a comment made by Ralph's mother in-law) in Episode #2 ''Funny Money'' of ''[[The Honeymooners]]''.\n* In 1960, [[Dixieland]] trombonist [[Turk Murphy]] christened his San Francisco jazz club \"Earthquake McGoon's,\" in honor of the perennial Dogpatch villain.\n* In 1968, the first year of operation, [[Dogpatch USA]] had 300,000 visitors. Admission was $1.50 for adults, and half price for children. Al Capp's son Colin Capp worked at the park that year, and met and married Vicki Cox, the actress portraying Moonbeam McSwine. Capp had previously spoofed the idea of a theme park based on his characters in ''Li'l Abner'', in a 1955 [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]] parody called \"Hal Yappland.\"\n* Al Capp designed the {{convert|23|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} statue of Josiah Flintabattey Flonatin (\"Flinty\") that graces the city of [[Flin Flon]], Manitoba. The town's name is taken from the lead character in a 1905 [[dime novel]], ''[[The Sunless City]]'' by [[J. E. Preston Muddock]]. Capp donated his time and talent to create the image. The character is of such importance to the identity of the city that the local Chamber of Commerce commissioned the minting of a $3.00 coin, which was considered legal tender within the city during the year following its issue. The Chamber had the [[fiberglass]] sculpture moved to its present location at the Flin Flon Tourist Park in 1962.\n* \"Natcherly,\" Capp's bastardization of \"naturally,\" turns up occasionally in popular culture \u2014 even without a specifically rural theme. It can be found in ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'', for instance, in [[Stephen Sondheim]]'s original lyrics to \"Gee, Officer Krupke\" (1957).\n* [[Mell Lazarus]], creator of ''[[Miss Peach]]'' and ''[[Momma]]'', wrote a comic novel in 1963 titled ''The Boss Is Crazy, Too.'' It was partly inspired by his apprenticeship days working for Al Capp and his brother Elliot Caplin at [[Toby Press]], which published ''Shmoo Comics'' in the late 1940s. In a seminar at the [[Charles Schulz Museum]] on November 8, 2008, Lazarus called his experience at Toby \"the five funniest years of my life.\" Lazarus went on to cite Capp as one of the \"four essentials\" in the field of newspaper cartoonists \u2014 along with Walt Kelly, Charles Schulz and Milton Caniff.\n* Utah governor [[Gary Herbert]] controversially referred to himself as \"Available Jones\", the Dogpatch entrepreneur who does anything for a price, at a private meeting with lobbyists April 27, 2016 to raise funds for his re-election campaign.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Roche|first1=Lisa Riley|title=Gov.

In periods of relative [[liberalization]], the influence of people and groups outside the formal party structure has tended to increase, particularly in the economic realm. Under the [[command economy]], every [[state-owned enterprise]] was required to have a party committee. The introduction of the [[market economy]] means that economic institutions now exist in which the party has limited or lots of power.\n\nNevertheless, in all governmental institutions in the PRC, the party committees at all levels maintain a powerful and pivotal role in the administration. Central party control is tightest in central government offices and in urban economic, industrial, and cultural settings; it is considerably looser over the government and party establishments in rural areas, where the majority of [[Mainland China|Mainland Chinese]] people live. The CPC's most important responsibility comes in the selection and promotion of personnel. They also see that party and state policy guidance is followed and that non-party members do not create autonomous organizations that could challenge party rule. Particularly important are the [[leading small group]]s which coordinate activities of different agencies. There is no convention that government committees contain at least one non-party member, party membership is a definite aid in the promotion and in being included in crucial policy-setting meetings.\n\nConstitutionally, the party's highest body is the [[National Congress of the Communist Party of China|Party Congress]], which is supposed to meet at least once every 5 years. Meetings were irregular before the [[Cultural Revolution]] but have been periodic since then. The party elects the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]] and the primary organs of power are formally parts of the central committee.\n\nThe primary organs of power in the Communist Party include:\n\n*The [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]], which is the highest-ranking official within the Party and usually the Chinese [[Paramount leader]].\n*The [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Politburo]], consisting of 22 full members (including the members of the Politburo Standing Committee);\n*The [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Politburo Standing Committee]], the most powerful decision-making body in China, which currently consists of seven members;\n*The  [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of China|Secretariat]], the principal administrative mechanism of the CPC, headed by the General Secretary;\n*The [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]];\n*The [[Central Discipline Inspection Commission]], which is charged with rooting out [[Political corruption|corruption]] and malfeasance among party cadres.\n\n==Government==\n{{Main|Government of China}}\n\nThe primary organs of state power are the [[National People's Congress]] (NPC), the [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]], and the [[State Council of China|State Council]]. Members of the State Council include the Premier, a variable number of vice premiers (now four), five state councillors (protocol equal of vice premiers but with narrower portfolios), and 29 ministers and heads of State Council commissions. During the 1980s there was an attempt made to separate party and state functions, with the party deciding general policy and the state carrying it out. The attempt was abandoned in the 1990s with the result that the political leadership within the state are also the leaders of the party, thereby creating a single centralized locus of power.\n\nAt the same time, there has been a convention that party and state offices be separated at levels other than the central government, and it is unheard of for a sub-national executive to also be party secretary. The conflict has been often known to develop between the chief executive and the party secretary, and this conflict is widely seen as intentional to prevent either from becoming too dominant. Some special cases are the [[Special Administrative Region]]s of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] where the Communist Party does not function at all as part of the governmental system, and the [[autonomous region]]s where, following Soviet practice, the chief executive is typically a member of the local ethnic group while the party general secretary is non-local and usually [[Han Chinese]].\n\nUnder the [[Constitution of China]], the NPC is the highest organ of state power in China. It meets annually for about 2 weeks to review and approve major new policy directions, laws, the budget, and major personnel changes. Most national legislation in China is adopted by the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress| Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC)]]. Most initiatives are presented to the NPCSC for consideration by the State Council after previous endorsement by the Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee. Although the NPC generally approves State Council policy and personnel recommendations, the NPC and its standing committee has increasingly asserted its role as the national legislature and has been able to force revisions in some laws.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merics.org/en/redirect/pdf-china-monitor-nummer-37-en/|title=PDF China Monitor Nummer 37 en - Mercator Institute for China Studies|website=www.merics.org|language=de|access-date=2017-03-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325202356/https://www.merics.org/en/redirect/pdf-china-monitor-nummer-37-en/|archive-date=25 March 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> For example, the State Council and the Party have been unable to secure passage of a fuel tax to finance the construction of [[freeway]]s.\n\n==Local government==\nCurrently, local government in China is structured in a hierarchy on four different levels. With the ''village'' being the grassroots (usually a hundred or so families), and not considered part of the hierarchy, local government advances through the ''township'', ''county'', ''prefecture'' or ''municipality'', and the ''province'' as the geographical area of jurisdiction increases. Each level in the hierarchy is responsible for overseeing the work carried out by lower levels on the administrative strata. At each level are two important officials. A figure that represents the Communist Party of China, colloquially termed the ''[[CPC party chief|Party chief]]'' or the ''Party Secretary'', acts as the policy maker. This figure is appointed by their superiors. The head of the local [[Central People's Government|People's Government]], is, in theory, elected by the people. Usually called a ''[[governor]]'', ''[[mayor]]'', or ''[[magistrate]]'', depending on the level, this figure acts to carry out the policies and most ceremonial duties. The distinction has evolved into a system where the Party Secretary is always in precedence above the leader of the People's Government.\n\nAfter [[Deng Xiaoping]] took power in 1978 greater autonomy has been given to provinces in terms of economic policy implementation as well as other areas of policy such as education and transportation. As a result, some provincial authorities have evolved tendencies of operating on a ''de facto'' [[Federal republic|federal]] system with Beijing. Prominent examples of greater autonomy are seen in the provinces of [[Guangdong]] and [[Zhejiang]], where local leaders do little to adhere to the strict standards issued by the Central Government, especially economic policy. In addition, conflicts have arisen in the relations of the central Party leaders with the few provincial-level Municipalities, most notably the [[Politics of Shanghai|municipal government of Shanghai]] and the rivalry between former Beijing mayor [[Chen Xitong]] and [[Jiang Zemin]]. The removal of Shanghai Municipality Party Secretary [[Chen Liangyu]] in September 2006 is the latest example.\n\nChina's system of [[autonomous region]]s and autonomous prefectures within provinces are formally intended to provide for greater autonomy by the ethnic group majority that inhabits the region. In practice, however, power rests with the Party secretary. Beijing will often appoint loyal party cadres to oversee the local work as Party secretary, while the local ''Chairman'' of the region's government is regarded as its nominal head. Power rests with the Party secretary. To avoid the solidification of local loyalties during a cadre's term in office, the central government freely and frequently transfers party cadres around different regions of the country, so a high ranking cadre's career might include service as governor or party secretary of several different provinces.\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n{{See also|Administrative divisions of China}}\n{{PRC provinces imagemap}}\n\n== National armed forces ==\n{{main|People's Liberation Army|People's Armed Police|Militia (China)}}\n\nThe Communist Party of China created and leads the People\u2019s Liberation Army. After the PRC was established in 1949, the PLA also became a state military. The state military system inherited and upholds the principle of the Communist Party\u2019s absolute leadership over the people\u2019s armed forces.  The Party and the State jointly established the Central Military Commission that carries out the task of supreme military leadership over the armed forces.\n\nThe 1954 [[PRC Constitution]] provides that the State Chairman (President) directs the armed forces and made the State Chairman the chair of the Defense Commission (the Defense Commission is an advisory body, it does not lead the armed forces).  On September 28, 1954, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party re-established the Central Military Commission as the leader of the PLA and the people\u2019s armed forces. From that time onwards, the system of joint Party and state military leadership was established. The Central Committee of the Communist Party leads in all military affairs. The State Chairman directs the state military forces and the development of the military forces managed by the State Council.<ref name=Xingzu>Pu Xingzu, Chapter 11, The State Military System in \"The Political System of the People's Republic of China\",(Zhonghua Renmin Gongheguo Zhengzhi Zhidu) Chief Editor Pu Xingzu, Shanghai, 2005,  Shanghai People\u2019s Publishing House. {{ISBN|7-208-05566-1}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2004, the fifth [[National People\u2019s Congress]] revised the State Constitution to provide that the State [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] leads all the armed forces of the state.  The chair of the State CMC is chosen and removed by the full NPC while the other members are chosen by the NPC Standing Committee.  However, the CMC of the [[Central Committee]] of the [[Communist Party of China]] remained the Party organization that directly leads the military and all the other armed forces. In actual practice, the Party CMC, after consultation with the democratic parties, proposes the names of the State CMC members of the NPC so that these people after going through the legal processes can be elected by the NPC to the State Central Military Commission. That is to say, that the CMC of the Central Committee and the CMC of the State are one group and one organization. However, looking at it organizationally, these two CMCs are subordinate to two different systems \u2013 the Party system and the State system. Therefore, the armed forces are under the absolute leadership of the Communist Party and are also the armed forces of the state.  This is a unique Chinese system that ensures the joint leadership of the Communist Party and the state over the armed forces.<ref name=Xingzu/>\n\n{{See also|List of wars involving the People's Republic of China}}\n\n==State leaders==\n{{see also|Paramount leader|List of national leaders of the People's Republic of China|Political position ranking of PRC|Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Generations of Chinese leadership}}\n\n===Politburo Standing Committee===\n{{CPC Politburo Standing Committee}}\n\n===Full Politburo members===\n{{CPC Politburo}}\n\n==Elections==\n{{main|Elections in the People's Republic of China}}\nNo substantial legal political opposition groups exist, and the country is mainly run by the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), but there are other political parties in the PRC, called \"democratic parties\", which participate in the [[People's Political Consultative Conference]] but mostly serve to endorse CPC policies.

These parties all formally accept the leadership of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) and their activities are directed by the [[United Front Work Department]] of the CPC. Their original function was to create the impression that the PRC was being ruled by a diverse national front, not a one-party dictatorship. The major role of these parties is to attract and subsequently muzzle niches in society that have political tendencies, such as academia. Although these parties are tightly controlled and do not challenge the Communist Party, members of the parties often individually are found in policy-making national institutions, and there is a convention that state institutions generally have at least one sinecure from a minor political party.\n\nThe minor parties include the [[Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Guomindang]], founded in 1948 by dissident members of the mainstream [[Kuomintang]] then under control of Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]]; [[China Democratic League]], created in 1941 by intellectuals in education and the arts; [[China Democratic National Construction Association]], formed in 1945 by educators and national [[capitalism|capitalist]]s (industrialists and business people); [[China Association for Promoting Democracy]], started in 1945 by intellectuals in cultural, education (primary and secondary schools), and publishing circles; [[Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party]], originated in 1930 by intellectuals in medicine, the arts, and education; [[China Party for Public Interest]] (China Zhi Gong Dang), founded in 1925 to attract the support of overseas Chinese; [[Jiusan Society]], founded in 1945 by a group of college professors and scientists to commemorate the victory of the \"[[World War II|international war against fascism]]\" on September 3; and [[Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League]], created in 1947 by \"patriotic supporters of democracy who originated in Taiwan and now reside on the mainland.\"\n\nCoordination between the eight registered minor parties and the Communist Party of China is done through the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] which meets annually in Beijing in March at about the same time that the National People's Congress meets. In addition, there are a few minor parties which either lack official recognition or are actively suppressed by the government, such as the [[Maoist Communist Party of China]], [[China Democracy Party]] and [[China New Democracy Party]], which have their headquarters outside of the [[Mainland China]].<ref>https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013030611/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html |date=13 October 2016 }} CIA - The World Factbook -- China, retrieved December 12, 2007.</ref>\n\n==Legal system==\n{{main|Law of the People's Republic of China}}\n\nThe Chinese legal code is a complex amalgam of custom and statute, largely focused on criminal law, though a rudimentary civil code has been in effect since January 1, 1987, and new legal codes have been in effect since January 1, 1980. Continuing efforts are being made to improve civil, administrative, criminal, and commercial law.\n\nAlthough the current law of China cannot be categorised by arbitrary rule, it is over-simplifying to describe it as a system of rule of law. While personal freedom and right to private property is nominally guaranteed by law, officials maintain the right to trespass citizens before proving or suspecting them breaking the law through the use of [[Administrative law|Droit administration.]] In other words, the concept of [[Habeas corpus]] does not apply in China. Also, Party members are subjected to different sets of law, namely the [[Constitution of the Communist Party of China]], which authorises itself to use state apparatus to regulate behaviours of party members, sometimes overriding [[Law of the land]]. One of the most distinctive characteristics of Chinese law is the lack of a mechanism to verify the constitutionality of statute laws. This in effect allows the enactment of any administrative laws as long as circumstances justify.\n\nThe government's efforts to promote rule by law (not the same as [[rule of law]]) are significant and ongoing. After the [[Cultural Revolution]], the PRC's leaders aimed to develop a legal system to restrain abuses of official authority and revolutionary excesses. In 1982, the National People's Congress adopted a new state constitution that emphasized the concept of rule by law by which party and state organizations are all subject to the law. (The importance of the rule by law was further elevated by a 1999 Constitutional amendment.) Many commentators{{Who|date=December 2011}} have pointed out that the emphasis on rule by law increases rather than decreases the power of the [[Communist Party of China]] because the party, in its position of power, is in a better position to change the law to suit its own needs.\n\nSince 1979, when the drive to establish a functioning legal system began, more than 301 laws and regulations, most of them in the economic area, have been promulgated. (After [[China and the World Trade Organization|China's entry into the WTO]], many new economically related laws have been put in place, while others have been amended.) The use of mediation committees - informed groups of citizens who resolve about 90% of the PRC's civil disputes and some minor criminal cases at no cost to the parties - is one innovative device. There are more than 800,000 such committees in both rural and urban areas.\n\nLegal reform became a government priority in the 1990s. Legislation designed to modernize and professionalize the nation's lawyers, judges, and prisons was enacted. The 1994 Administrative Procedure Law allows citizens to sue officials for abuse of authority or malfeasance. In addition, the criminal law and the criminal procedures laws were amended to introduce significant reforms. The criminal law amendments abolished the crime of \"counter-revolutionary\" activity (and references to \"counter-revolutionaries\" disappeared with the passing of the 1999 Constitutional amendment), while criminal procedures reforms encouraged the establishment of a more transparent, adversarial trial process. The PRC Constitution and laws provide for fundamental human rights, including due process, although those laws also provide for limitations of those rights.\n\nAlthough the human rights situation in [[mainland China]] has improved markedly since the 1960s (the 2004 Constitutional amendments specifically stressed that the State protects human rights), the government remains determined to prevent any organized opposition to its rule. [[Amnesty International]] estimates that the PRC holds several thousand political prisoners. Although illegal, there have been reports of [[torture]] by civil authorities.\n\n==Nationality and ethnicity==\nNationality is granted at birth to children with at least one Chinese-national parent, with some exceptions. In general, [[naturalization]] or the obtainment of the People's Republic of China nationality is difficult. The Nationality Law prescribes only three conditions for the obtainment of PRC nationality (marriage to a PRC national is one, permanent residence is another). If a PRC citizen voluntarily obtains a foreign nationality, he or she loses Chinese nationality automatically (yet this regulation does not apply to party members or government officials{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}). If the citizen then wishes to resume PRC nationality, foreign nationality is no longer recognized. For more details, see [[Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China]].\n\nThe PRC is officially a multi-ethnic state providing ethnic autonomy in the form of [[autonomous entities of China|autonomous administrative entities]] in accordance with Section 6 of Chapter 3 (Articles 112-122) of the [[Constitution of China]], and with more detail under the [[Law of the People's Republic of China on Ethnical Regional Autonomy System]]. By law, ethnic minorities receive advantages in areas such as population control, school admissions, government employment, and military recruitment. The PRC recognises 56 nationalities in China and simultaneously categorises them as one hegemonic [[Chinese nation]]. However, [[Separatism|separatist]] sentiment has occasionally flared in [[Tibet]] and [[Xinjiang]]. As such, independence groups and foreign human rights groups are critical of the PRC's policies in ethnic areas and have bemoaned the presence of [[Han Chinese]] (the main ethnic group of China) in Xinjiang and Tibet.\n\n==Foreign relations==\n[[Image:Bushhujintao.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Hu Jintao]] and US president [[George W.

The government actively opposes foreign government meetings with the [[14th Dalai Lama]] in a political capacity, as the spokesperson of a separatist movement in Tibet.\n\nThe PRC has been playing a leading role in calling for [[free trade area]]s and security pacts amongst its Asia-Pacific neighbours. In 2004, the PRC proposed an entirely new [[East Asia Summit]] (EAS) framework as a forum for regional security issues that pointedly excluded the United States.<ref>Dillon, Dana and John Tkacik Jr, [http://www.policyreview.org/134/dillon.html \"China\u2019s Quest for Asia\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210135228/http://www.policyreview.org/134/dillon.html |date=10 February 2006 }}, ''Policy Review'', December 2005 and January 2006, Issue No. 134.

China is also a founder and member of the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organization]] (SCO), alongside [[Russia]] and the [[Central Asia]]n republics.\n\nMuch of the current foreign policy is based on the concept of [[China's peaceful development]]. Nonetheless, crises in relations with foreign countries have occurred at various times in its recent history, particularly with the [[United States]]; e.g., the U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in [[Belgrade]] during the [[Kosovo War|Kosovo conflict]] in May 1999 and the [[Hainan Island incident]] in April 2001. China's foreign relations with many Western nations suffered for a time following the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]. A much troubled foreign relationship is that between [[Sino-Japanese relations|China and Japan]], which has been strained at times by Japan's refusal to acknowledge its wartime past to the satisfaction of the PRC, such as [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|revisionistic]] comments made by prominent Japanese officials, and insufficient details given to the [[Nanking Massacre|Nanjing Massacre]] and other [[Japanese war crimes|atrocities]] committed during [[World War II]] in [[Japanese history textbook controversies|Japanese history textbooks]]. Another point of conflict between the two countries is the frequent visits by Japanese government officials to the [[Yasukuni Shrine]], which honours not only Japanese World War II dead but also many convicted World War II war criminals, including 14 Class A convictions.\n\n==International disputes==\nThe PRC is in a number of [[Foreign relations of China#International territorial disputes|international territorial disputes]], several of which involved the Sino-Russian border. Although the great majority of them are now resolved, China's territorial disputes have led to several localized wars in the last 50 years, including the [[Sino-Indian War]] in 1962, the [[Sino-Soviet border conflict]] in 1969 and the [[Sino-Vietnam War]] in 1979. In 2001, China and Russia signed the [[2001 Sino-Russian Treaty of Friendship|Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation]],<ref>[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2006-03/21/content_548330.htm Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060826175727/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2006-03/21/content_548330.htm |date=26 August 2006 }} (March 21, 2006).

In periods of relative [[liberalization]], the influence of people and groups outside the formal party structure has tended to increase, particularly in the economic realm. Under the [[command economy]], every [[state-owned enterprise]] was required to have a party committee. The introduction of the [[market economy]] means that economic institutions now exist in which the party has limited or lots of power.\n\nNevertheless, in all governmental institutions in the PRC, the party committees at all levels maintain a powerful and pivotal role in the administration. Central party control is tightest in central government offices and in urban economic, industrial, and cultural settings; it is considerably looser over the government and party establishments in rural areas, where the majority of [[Mainland China|Mainland Chinese]] people live. The CPC's most important responsibility comes in the selection and promotion of personnel. They also see that party and state policy guidance is followed and that non-party members do not create autonomous organizations that could challenge party rule. Particularly important are the [[leading small group]]s which coordinate activities of different agencies. There is no convention that government committees contain at least one non-party member, party membership is a definite aid in the promotion and in being included in crucial policy-setting meetings.\n\nConstitutionally, the party's highest body is the [[National Congress of the Communist Party of China|Party Congress]], which is supposed to meet at least once every 5 years. Meetings were irregular before the [[Cultural Revolution]] but have been periodic since then. The party elects the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]] and the primary organs of power are formally parts of the central committee.\n\nThe primary organs of power in the Communist Party include:\n\n*The [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]], which is the highest-ranking official within the Party and usually the Chinese [[Paramount leader]].\n*The [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Politburo]], consisting of 22 full members (including the members of the Politburo Standing Committee);\n*The [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Politburo Standing Committee]], the most powerful decision-making body in China, which currently consists of seven members;\n*The  [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of China|Secretariat]], the principal administrative mechanism of the CPC, headed by the General Secretary;\n*The [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]];\n*The [[Central Discipline Inspection Commission]], which is charged with rooting out [[Political corruption|corruption]] and malfeasance among party cadres.\n\n==Government==\n{{Main|Government of China}}\n\nThe primary organs of state power are the [[National People's Congress]] (NPC), the [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]], and the [[State Council of China|State Council]]. Members of the State Council include the Premier, a variable number of vice premiers (now four), five state councillors (protocol equal of vice premiers but with narrower portfolios), and 29 ministers and heads of State Council commissions. During the 1980s there was an attempt made to separate party and state functions, with the party deciding general policy and the state carrying it out. The attempt was abandoned in the 1990s with the result that the political leadership within the state are also the leaders of the party, thereby creating a single centralized locus of power.\n\nAt the same time, there has been a convention that party and state offices be separated at levels other than the central government, and it is unheard of for a sub-national executive to also be party secretary. The conflict has been often known to develop between the chief executive and the party secretary, and this conflict is widely seen as intentional to prevent either from becoming too dominant. Some special cases are the [[Special Administrative Region]]s of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] where the Communist Party does not function at all as part of the governmental system, and the [[autonomous region]]s where, following Soviet practice, the chief executive is typically a member of the local ethnic group while the party general secretary is non-local and usually [[Han Chinese]].\n\nUnder the [[Constitution of China]], the NPC is the highest organ of state power in China. It meets annually for about 2 weeks to review and approve major new policy directions, laws, the budget, and major personnel changes. Most national legislation in China is adopted by the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress| Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC)]]. Most initiatives are presented to the NPCSC for consideration by the State Council after previous endorsement by the Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee. Although the NPC generally approves State Council policy and personnel recommendations, the NPC and its standing committee has increasingly asserted its role as the national legislature and has been able to force revisions in some laws.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merics.org/en/redirect/pdf-china-monitor-nummer-37-en/|title=PDF China Monitor Nummer 37 en - Mercator Institute for China Studies|website=www.merics.org|language=de|access-date=2017-03-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325202356/https://www.merics.org/en/redirect/pdf-china-monitor-nummer-37-en/|archive-date=25 March 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> For example, the State Council and the Party have been unable to secure passage of a fuel tax to finance the construction of [[freeway]]s.\n\n==Local government==\nCurrently, local government in China is structured in a hierarchy on four different levels. With the ''village'' being the grassroots (usually a hundred or so families), and not considered part of the hierarchy, local government advances through the ''township'', ''county'', ''prefecture'' or ''municipality'', and the ''province'' as the geographical area of jurisdiction increases. Each level in the hierarchy is responsible for overseeing the work carried out by lower levels on the administrative strata. At each level are two important officials. A figure that represents the Communist Party of China, colloquially termed the ''[[CPC party chief|Party chief]]'' or the ''Party Secretary'', acts as the policy maker. This figure is appointed by their superiors. The head of the local [[Central People's Government|People's Government]], is, in theory, elected by the people. Usually called a ''[[governor]]'', ''[[mayor]]'', or ''[[magistrate]]'', depending on the level, this figure acts to carry out the policies and most ceremonial duties. The distinction has evolved into a system where the Party Secretary is always in precedence above the leader of the People's Government.\n\nAfter [[Deng Xiaoping]] took power in 1978 greater autonomy has been given to provinces in terms of economic policy implementation as well as other areas of policy such as education and transportation. As a result, some provincial authorities have evolved tendencies of operating on a ''de facto'' [[Federal republic|federal]] system with Beijing. Prominent examples of greater autonomy are seen in the provinces of [[Guangdong]] and [[Zhejiang]], where local leaders do little to adhere to the strict standards issued by the Central Government, especially economic policy. In addition, conflicts have arisen in the relations of the central Party leaders with the few provincial-level Municipalities, most notably the [[Politics of Shanghai|municipal government of Shanghai]] and the rivalry between former Beijing mayor [[Chen Xitong]] and [[Jiang Zemin]]. The removal of Shanghai Municipality Party Secretary [[Chen Liangyu]] in September 2006 is the latest example.\n\nChina's system of [[autonomous region]]s and autonomous prefectures within provinces are formally intended to provide for greater autonomy by the ethnic group majority that inhabits the region. In practice, however, power rests with the Party secretary. Beijing will often appoint loyal party cadres to oversee the local work as Party secretary, while the local ''Chairman'' of the region's government is regarded as its nominal head. Power rests with the Party secretary. To avoid the solidification of local loyalties during a cadre's term in office, the central government freely and frequently transfers party cadres around different regions of the country, so a high ranking cadre's career might include service as governor or party secretary of several different provinces.\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n{{See also|Administrative divisions of China}}\n{{PRC provinces imagemap}}\n\n== National armed forces ==\n{{main|People's Liberation Army|People's Armed Police|Militia (China)}}\n\nThe Communist Party of China created and leads the People\u2019s Liberation Army. After the PRC was established in 1949, the PLA also became a state military. The state military system inherited and upholds the principle of the Communist Party\u2019s absolute leadership over the people\u2019s armed forces.  The Party and the State jointly established the Central Military Commission that carries out the task of supreme military leadership over the armed forces.\n\nThe 1954 [[PRC Constitution]] provides that the State Chairman (President) directs the armed forces and made the State Chairman the chair of the Defense Commission (the Defense Commission is an advisory body, it does not lead the armed forces).  On September 28, 1954, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party re-established the Central Military Commission as the leader of the PLA and the people\u2019s armed forces. From that time onwards, the system of joint Party and state military leadership was established. The Central Committee of the Communist Party leads in all military affairs. The State Chairman directs the state military forces and the development of the military forces managed by the State Council.<ref name=Xingzu>Pu Xingzu, Chapter 11, The State Military System in \"The Political System of the People's Republic of China\",(Zhonghua Renmin Gongheguo Zhengzhi Zhidu) Chief Editor Pu Xingzu, Shanghai, 2005,  Shanghai People\u2019s Publishing House. {{ISBN|7-208-05566-1}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2004, the fifth [[National People\u2019s Congress]] revised the State Constitution to provide that the State [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] leads all the armed forces of the state.  The chair of the State CMC is chosen and removed by the full NPC while the other members are chosen by the NPC Standing Committee.  However, the CMC of the [[Central Committee]] of the [[Communist Party of China]] remained the Party organization that directly leads the military and all the other armed forces. In actual practice, the Party CMC, after consultation with the democratic parties, proposes the names of the State CMC members of the NPC so that these people after going through the legal processes can be elected by the NPC to the State Central Military Commission. That is to say, that the CMC of the Central Committee and the CMC of the State are one group and one organization. However, looking at it organizationally, these two CMCs are subordinate to two different systems \u2013 the Party system and the State system. Therefore, the armed forces are under the absolute leadership of the Communist Party and are also the armed forces of the state.

These parties all formally accept the leadership of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) and their activities are directed by the [[United Front Work Department]] of the CPC. Their original function was to create the impression that the PRC was being ruled by a diverse national front, not a one-party dictatorship. The major role of these parties is to attract and subsequently muzzle niches in society that have political tendencies, such as academia. Although these parties are tightly controlled and do not challenge the Communist Party, members of the parties often individually are found in policy-making national institutions, and there is a convention that state institutions generally have at least one sinecure from a minor political party.\n\nThe minor parties include the [[Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Guomindang]], founded in 1948 by dissident members of the mainstream [[Kuomintang]] then under control of Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]]; [[China Democratic League]], created in 1941 by intellectuals in education and the arts; [[China Democratic National Construction Association]], formed in 1945 by educators and national [[capitalism|capitalist]]s (industrialists and business people); [[China Association for Promoting Democracy]], started in 1945 by intellectuals in cultural, education (primary and secondary schools), and publishing circles; [[Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party]], originated in 1930 by intellectuals in medicine, the arts, and education; [[China Party for Public Interest]] (China Zhi Gong Dang), founded in 1925 to attract the support of overseas Chinese; [[Jiusan Society]], founded in 1945 by a group of college professors and scientists to commemorate the victory of the \"[[World War II|international war against fascism]]\" on September 3; and [[Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League]], created in 1947 by \"patriotic supporters of democracy who originated in Taiwan and now reside on the mainland.\"\n\nCoordination between the eight registered minor parties and the Communist Party of China is done through the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] which meets annually in Beijing in March at about the same time that the National People's Congress meets. In addition, there are a few minor parties which either lack official recognition or are actively suppressed by the government, such as the [[Maoist Communist Party of China]], [[China Democracy Party]] and [[China New Democracy Party]], which have their headquarters outside of the [[Mainland China]].<ref>https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013030611/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html |date=13 October 2016 }} CIA - The World Factbook -- China, retrieved December 12, 2007.</ref>\n\n==Legal system==\n{{main|Law of the People's Republic of China}}\n\nThe Chinese legal code is a complex amalgam of custom and statute, largely focused on criminal law, though a rudimentary civil code has been in effect since January 1, 1987, and new legal codes have been in effect since January 1, 1980. Continuing efforts are being made to improve civil, administrative, criminal, and commercial law.\n\nAlthough the current law of China cannot be categorised by arbitrary rule, it is over-simplifying to describe it as a system of rule of law. While personal freedom and right to private property is nominally guaranteed by law, officials maintain the right to trespass citizens before proving or suspecting them breaking the law through the use of [[Administrative law|Droit administration.]] In other words, the concept of [[Habeas corpus]] does not apply in China. Also, Party members are subjected to different sets of law, namely the [[Constitution of the Communist Party of China]], which authorises itself to use state apparatus to regulate behaviours of party members, sometimes overriding [[Law of the land]]. One of the most distinctive characteristics of Chinese law is the lack of a mechanism to verify the constitutionality of statute laws. This in effect allows the enactment of any administrative laws as long as circumstances justify.\n\nThe government's efforts to promote rule by law (not the same as [[rule of law]]) are significant and ongoing. After the [[Cultural Revolution]], the PRC's leaders aimed to develop a legal system to restrain abuses of official authority and revolutionary excesses. In 1982, the National People's Congress adopted a new state constitution that emphasized the concept of rule by law by which party and state organizations are all subject to the law. (The importance of the rule by law was further elevated by a 1999 Constitutional amendment.) Many commentators{{Who|date=December 2011}} have pointed out that the emphasis on rule by law increases rather than decreases the power of the [[Communist Party of China]] because the party, in its position of power, is in a better position to change the law to suit its own needs.\n\nSince 1979, when the drive to establish a functioning legal system began, more than 301 laws and regulations, most of them in the economic area, have been promulgated. (After [[China and the World Trade Organization|China's entry into the WTO]], many new economically related laws have been put in place, while others have been amended.) The use of mediation committees - informed groups of citizens who resolve about 90% of the PRC's civil disputes and some minor criminal cases at no cost to the parties - is one innovative device. There are more than 800,000 such committees in both rural and urban areas.\n\nLegal reform became a government priority in the 1990s. Legislation designed to modernize and professionalize the nation's lawyers, judges, and prisons was enacted. The 1994 Administrative Procedure Law allows citizens to sue officials for abuse of authority or malfeasance. In addition, the criminal law and the criminal procedures laws were amended to introduce significant reforms. The criminal law amendments abolished the crime of \"counter-revolutionary\" activity (and references to \"counter-revolutionaries\" disappeared with the passing of the 1999 Constitutional amendment), while criminal procedures reforms encouraged the establishment of a more transparent, adversarial trial process. The PRC Constitution and laws provide for fundamental human rights, including due process, although those laws also provide for limitations of those rights.\n\nAlthough the human rights situation in [[mainland China]] has improved markedly since the 1960s (the 2004 Constitutional amendments specifically stressed that the State protects human rights), the government remains determined to prevent any organized opposition to its rule. [[Amnesty International]] estimates that the PRC holds several thousand political prisoners. Although illegal, there have been reports of [[torture]] by civil authorities.\n\n==Nationality and ethnicity==\nNationality is granted at birth to children with at least one Chinese-national parent, with some exceptions. In general, [[naturalization]] or the obtainment of the People's Republic of China nationality is difficult. The Nationality Law prescribes only three conditions for the obtainment of PRC nationality (marriage to a PRC national is one, permanent residence is another). If a PRC citizen voluntarily obtains a foreign nationality, he or she loses Chinese nationality automatically (yet this regulation does not apply to party members or government officials{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}). If the citizen then wishes to resume PRC nationality, foreign nationality is no longer recognized. For more details, see [[Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China]].\n\nThe PRC is officially a multi-ethnic state providing ethnic autonomy in the form of [[autonomous entities of China|autonomous administrative entities]] in accordance with Section 6 of Chapter 3 (Articles 112-122) of the [[Constitution of China]], and with more detail under the [[Law of the People's Republic of China on Ethnical Regional Autonomy System]]. By law, ethnic minorities receive advantages in areas such as population control, school admissions, government employment, and military recruitment. The PRC recognises 56 nationalities in China and simultaneously categorises them as one hegemonic [[Chinese nation]]. However, [[Separatism|separatist]] sentiment has occasionally flared in [[Tibet]] and [[Xinjiang]]. As such, independence groups and foreign human rights groups are critical of the PRC's policies in ethnic areas and have bemoaned the presence of [[Han Chinese]] (the main ethnic group of China) in Xinjiang and Tibet.\n\n==Foreign relations==\n[[Image:Bushhujintao.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Hu Jintao]] and US president [[George W.

The government actively opposes foreign government meetings with the [[14th Dalai Lama]] in a political capacity, as the spokesperson of a separatist movement in Tibet.\n\nThe PRC has been playing a leading role in calling for [[free trade area]]s and security pacts amongst its Asia-Pacific neighbours. In 2004, the PRC proposed an entirely new [[East Asia Summit]] (EAS) framework as a forum for regional security issues that pointedly excluded the United States.<ref>Dillon, Dana and John Tkacik Jr, [http://www.policyreview.org/134/dillon.html \"China\u2019s Quest for Asia\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210135228/http://www.policyreview.org/134/dillon.html |date=10 February 2006 }}, ''Policy Review'', December 2005 and January 2006, Issue No. 134.

China is also a founder and member of the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organization]] (SCO), alongside [[Russia]] and the [[Central Asia]]n republics.\n\nMuch of the current foreign policy is based on the concept of [[China's peaceful development]]. Nonetheless, crises in relations with foreign countries have occurred at various times in its recent history, particularly with the [[United States]]; e.g., the U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in [[Belgrade]] during the [[Kosovo War|Kosovo conflict]] in May 1999 and the [[Hainan Island incident]] in April 2001. China's foreign relations with many Western nations suffered for a time following the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]. A much troubled foreign relationship is that between [[Sino-Japanese relations|China and Japan]], which has been strained at times by Japan's refusal to acknowledge its wartime past to the satisfaction of the PRC, such as [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|revisionistic]] comments made by prominent Japanese officials, and insufficient details given to the [[Nanking Massacre|Nanjing Massacre]] and other [[Japanese war crimes|atrocities]] committed during [[World War II]] in [[Japanese history textbook controversies|Japanese history textbooks]]. Another point of conflict between the two countries is the frequent visits by Japanese government officials to the [[Yasukuni Shrine]], which honours not only Japanese World War II dead but also many convicted World War II war criminals, including 14 Class A convictions.\n\n==International disputes==\nThe PRC is in a number of [[Foreign relations of China#International territorial disputes|international territorial disputes]], several of which involved the Sino-Russian border. Although the great majority of them are now resolved, China's territorial disputes have led to several localized wars in the last 50 years, including the [[Sino-Indian War]] in 1962, the [[Sino-Soviet border conflict]] in 1969 and the [[Sino-Vietnam War]] in 1979. In 2001, China and Russia signed the [[2001 Sino-Russian Treaty of Friendship|Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation]],<ref>[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2006-03/21/content_548330.htm Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060826175727/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2006-03/21/content_548330.htm |date=26 August 2006 }} (March 21, 2006).

To downgrade its importance in the eyes of both friend and foe, he ordered the name, with its historic connotations, changed, reasoning that if the Allies managed to break through they would not be able to use the more impressive name to magnify their victory claims. In response to this order, Kesselring renamed it the \"'''Green Line'''\" (''Gr\u00fcne Linie'') in June 1944.\n\nUsing more than 15,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|slave labourers]], the Germans created more than 2,000 well-fortified [[machine gun nest]]s, [[casemate]]s, [[bunker]]s, [[observation post]]s and artillery fighting positions to repel any attempt to breach the Gothic Line.<ref>Sterner, 2008. p.106</ref> Initially this line was breached during Operation Olive (also sometimes known as the [[Battle of Rimini (1944)|Battle of Rimini]]), but Kesselring's forces were consistently able to retire in good order.

The fighting was comparable to [[Second Battle of El Alamein|El Alamein]], [[Battle of the Mareth Line|Mareth]] and the [[Battle of Monte Cassino|Gustav Line (Monte-Cassino)]].}}\n\n==Background==\nAfter the nearly concurrent breakthroughs at [[Battle of Monte Cassino|Cassino]] and [[Battle of Anzio|Anzio]] in spring 1944, the 11 nations representing the Allies in Italy finally had a chance to trap the Germans in a [[pincer movement]] and to realize some of the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]]'s strategic goals for the long, costly campaign against the [[Axis powers|Axis]] \"underbelly\". This would have required the [[United States Army North|U.S. Fifth Army]] under [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Mark W. Clark]] to commit most of his Anzio forces to the drive east from [[Cisterna di Latina|Cisterna]], and to execute the envelopment envisioned in the original planning for the Anzio landing (i.e., flank the [[10th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 10th Army]], and sever its northbound line of retreat from Cassino). Instead, fearing that the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]], under [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]] [[Oliver Leese|Sir Oliver Leese]], might beat him to the Italian capital of [[Rome]], Clark diverted a large part of his Anzio force in that direction in an attempt to ensure that he and the Fifth Army would have the honour of liberating the city.\n\nAs a result, most of ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' [[Albert Kesselring]]'s forces slipped the noose and fell back north fighting delaying actions, notably in late June on the [[Trasimene Line]] (running from just south of [[Ancona]] on the east coast, past the southern shores of [[Lake Trasimeno]] near [[Perugia]] and on to the west coast south of [[Grosseto]]) and in July on the [[Arno Line]] (running from the west coast along the line of the [[Arno|Arno River]] and into the [[Apennine Mountains]] north of [[Arezzo]]). This gave time to consolidate the Gothic Line, a {{convert|10|mi|km}} deep belt of fortifications extending from south of [[La Spezia]] (on the west coast) to the [[Foglia River|Foglia Valley]], through the natural defensive wall of the Apennines (which ran unbroken nearly from coast to coast, {{convert|50|mi|km}} deep and with high crests and peaks rising to {{convert|7000|ft|m}}), to the [[Adriatic Sea]] between [[Pesaro]] and [[Ravenna]], on the east coast. The emplacements included numerous concrete-reinforced gun pits and trenches and 2,376 machine-gun nests with interlocking fire, 479 anti-tank, mortar and assault gun positions, {{convert|120000|m|yd}} of barbed wire and many miles of anti-tank ditches.<ref>Orgill, p. 28.</ref> This last redoubt proved the Germans' determination to continue fighting.\n\nNevertheless, it was fortunate for the Allies that at this stage of the war the [[Italian resistance movement|Italian partisan]] forces had become highly effective in disrupting the German preparations in the high mountains. By September 1944, German generals were no longer able to move freely in the area behind their main lines because of partisan activity. ''[[Generalleutnant]]'' [[Frido von Senger und Etterlin]]\u2014commanding [[XIV Panzer Corps|XIV ''Panzer'' Corps]] (''XIV Panzerkorps'')\u2014later wrote that he had taken to travelling in a little Volkswagen \"(displaying) no general's insignia of rank\u2014no peaked cap, no gold or red flags...\". One of his colleagues who ignored this caution\u2014[[Wilhelm Crisolli]] (commanding the [[20th Luftwaffe Field Division (Germany)|20th ''Luftwaffe'' Field Division]])\u2014was caught and killed by partisans as he returned from a conference at corps headquarters.<ref>Orgill, p. 36.</ref>\n\nConstruction of the defences was also hampered by the deliberately poor quality concrete provided by local Italian mills whilst captured partisans forced into the construction gangs supplemented the natural lethargy of forced labour with clever sabotage. Nevertheless, prior to the Allies' attack, Kesselring had declared himself satisfied with the work done, especially on the Adriatic side where he \"...contemplated an assault on the left wing....with a certain confidence\".<ref>Orgill, p. 29.</ref>\n\n===Allied strategy===\n{{further|Gothic Line order of battle}}\n\nThe Italian Front was seen by the Allies to be of secondary importance to the [[Operation Overlord|offensives through France]], and this was underlined by the withdrawal during the summer of 1944 of seven divisions from the U.S. Fifth Army to take part in the landings in southern France, [[Operation Dragoon]]. By 5 August, the strength of the Fifth Army had fallen from 249,000 to 153,000,<ref>Orgill, p. 20.</ref> and they had only 18 divisions to confront the combined German 10th and [[14th Army (Wehrmacht)|14th Armies]]\u2032 strength of 14 divisions plus four to seven reserve divisions.\n\nNevertheless, Winston Churchill and the British Chiefs of Staff were keen to break through the German defences to open up the route to the northeast through the \"Ljubljana Gap\" into [[National Socialist Austria|Austria]] and [[Hungary during World War II|Hungary]]. Whilst this would threaten Germany from the rear, Churchill was more concerned to forestall the [[Red Army|Russians]] advancing into central Europe. The U.S. Chiefs of Staff had strongly opposed this strategy as diluting the Allied focus in France. However, following the Allied successes in France during the summer, the U.S. Chiefs relented, and there was complete agreement amongst the [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]] at the [[Second Quebec Conference]] on 12 September.<ref>Orgill, pp. 114\u2013115.</ref>\n\n===Allied plan of attack===\n<!-- Operation Olive redirects here, please change the redirect if the section name is altered -->\nThe original plan of [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Sir Harold Alexander]], the [[Commander-in-chief|Commander-in-Chief]] (C-in-C) of the [[Allied Armies in Italy]] (AAI)\u2014as formulated by his [[Chief of staff|Chief of Staff]], [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]] [[John Harding, 1st Baron Harding of Petherton|Sir John Harding]]\u2014was to storm the Gothic Line in the centre, where most of [[Gothic Line order of battle|his forces]] were already concentrated. It was the shortest route to his objective, the plains of [[Lombardy]], and could be mounted quickly. He mounted a deception operation to convince the Germans that the main blow would come on the Adriatic front.\n\n[[File:Gothic Line - Concept of OperationOlive 1944.png|thumb|380px|The Gothic Line, August 1944 and the concept of Operation Olive. The dark blue arrows represent major Allied attacks.]]\n\nOn 4 August, Alexander met Lieutenant-General Leese, the British Eighth Army commander, to find that Leese did not favour the plan.<ref>Jackson, p. 119.</ref> He argued that the Allies had lost their specialist [[French Expeditionary Corps (1943\u201344)|French mountain troops]] to [[Operation Dragoon]] and that the Eighth Army's strength lay in tactics combining infantry, armour and guns which could not be employed in the high mountains of the central Apennines.\n\nIt has also been suggested that Leese disliked working in league with Clark after the Fifth Army's controversial move on Rome at the end of May and early June and wished for the Eighth Army to win the battle on its own.<ref>Blaxland, p. 163.</ref> He suggested a surprise attack along the Adriatic coast. Although Harding did not share Leese's view and Eighth Army planning staff had already rejected the idea of an Adriatic offensive (because it would be difficult to bring the necessary concentration of forces to bear), General Alexander was not prepared to force Leese to adopt a plan which was against his inclination and judgement<ref>Orgill, p. 33.</ref> and Harding was persuaded to change his mind.\n\nOperation Olive\u2014as the new offensive was christened\u2014called for Leese's Eighth Army to attack up the Adriatic coast toward [[Pesaro]] and [[Rimini]] and draw in the German reserves from the centre of the country. Clark's Fifth Army would then attack in the weakened central Apennines north of [[Florence]] toward [[Bologna]] with [[XIII Corps (United Kingdom)|British XIII Corps]] on the right wing of the attack fanning toward the coast to create a pincer with the Eighth Army advance. This meant that as a preparatory move, the bulk of the Eighth Army had to be transferred from the centre of Italy to the Adriatic coast, taking two valuable weeks, while a new intelligence deception plan (Operation Ulster)<ref>Jackson, p. 126.</ref> was commenced to convince Kesselring that the main attack would be in the centre.\n\n==Adriatic Front (British Eighth Army)==\n\n===Eighth Army dispositions for Operation Olive===\n[[File:The British Army in Italy 1944 NA18091.jpg|thumb|A British [[M10 tank destroyer]] Self Propelled Gun (SPG) and infantrymen of the 5th Battalion, [[Sherwood Foresters]] during the advance to the Gothic Line, 27\u201328 August 1944.]]\n\nOn the coast, Leese had [[II Corps (Poland)|Polish II Corps]] with [[5th Kresowa Infantry Division|5th Kresowa Division]] in the front line and the [[3rd Carpathian Rifle Division (Poland)|3rd Carpathian Division]] in reserve. To the left of the Poles was [[I Canadian Corps|Canadian I Corps]] which had the [[1st Canadian Division|Canadian 1st Infantry Division]] (with the [[21st Army Tank Brigade|British 21st Tank Brigade]] under command) in the front line and the [[5th Canadian Division|Canadian 5th Armoured Division]] in reserve.\n\nFor the opening phase the corps artillery was strengthened with the addition of the [[4th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|British 4th Infantry Division]]'s artillery. West of the Canadians was [[V Corps (United Kingdom)|British V Corps]] with the [[46th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|British 46th Infantry Division]] manning the right of the corps front line and [[4th Infantry Division (India)|4th Indian Infantry Division]] its left. In reserve were the British [[56th (London) Infantry Division|56th Infantry]] and [[1st (United Kingdom) Division|1st Armoured Divisions]] and the British [[7th Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|7th Armoured]] and [[25th Army Tank Brigade|25th Tank Brigades]].\n\nFurther to the rear was the British 4th Division, waiting to be called forward to join the corps. The left flank of the Eighth Army front was guarded by [[X Corps (United Kingdom)|British X Corps]] employing the [[10th Indian Infantry Division]] and two armoured car regiments, [[12th Royal Lancers|12th]] and [[27th Lancers]]. Prior to the attack the I Canadian Corps' front was covered by patrolling Polish cavalry units and V Corps by patrolling elements of the Italian Liberation Corps. In army reserve, also waiting to be called forward, was the [[2nd New Zealand Division]].<ref>Jackson, p. 226.</ref>\n\n===German 10th Army dispositions===\nFacing the Eighth Army was the German 10th Army's [[LXXVI Panzer Corps|LXXVI ''Panzer'' Corps]] (''LXXVI Panzerkorps''). Initially, this had only three divisions: [[1st Parachute Division (Germany)|1st Parachute Division]] facing the Poles, [[71st Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|71st Infantry Division]] (''71. Infantriedivision'') inland on the parachute division's right and [[278th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|278th Division]] (''278. Infantriedivision'') on the Corps right flank in the hills which was in the process of relieving [[5th Mountain Division (Wehrmacht)|5th Mountain Division]]. The 10th Army had a further five divisions in [[51st Mountain Corps]] covering {{convert|80|mi|km|abbr=on}} of front line on the right of LXVI ''Panzer'' Corps and a further two divisions\u2014[[162nd Turkoman Division|162nd Infantry Division]] (''162.

Infantriedivision'') (replaced by [[29th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|29th ''Panzer Grenadier'' Division]] (''29. Panzergrenadierdivision'') from 25 August)\u2014covering the Adriatic coast behind LXVI Corps. In addition, Kesselring had in his Army Group Reserve the [[90th Light Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|90th ''Panzer'' Grenadier Division]] (''90. Panzergrenadierdivision'') and [[23rd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|26th ''Panzer'' Division]] (''26. Panzerdivision'').<ref>Jackson, p. 227.</ref>\n\n===Eighth Army attack===\nThe British Eighth Army crossed the Metauro river and launched its attack against the Gothic Line outposts on 25 August. As Polish II Corps, on the coast and I Canadian Corps, on the coastal plain on the Poles' left, advanced towards Pesaro the coastal plain narrowed and it was planned that the Polish Corps, weakened by losses and lack of replacements, would go into Army reserve and the front on the coastal plain would become the responsibility of the Canadian Corps alone. The Germans were taken by surprise, to the extent that both von Vietinghoff, and the parachute division's commander\u2014''[[Generalmajor]] '' [[Richard Heidrich]]\u2014were away on leave.<ref name=\"Jackson234\">Jackson, p. 234.</ref>\n\nThey were in the process of pulling back their forward units to the Green I fortifications of the Gothic Line proper and Kesselring was uncertain whether this was the start of a major offensive or just Eighth Army advancing to occupy vacated ground whilst the main Allied attack would come on the U.S. Fifth Army front towards Bologna. On 27 August, he was still expressing the view that the attack was a diversion and so would not commit reserves to the front.<ref name=\"Jackson234\"/> It was not until 28 August\u2014when he saw a captured copy of Leese's order of the day to his army prior to the attack\u2014that Kesselring realised that a major offensive was in progress,<ref>Orgill, pp. 46\u201347.</ref> and three divisions of reinforcements were ordered from Bologna to the Adriatic front, still needing at least two days to get into position.\n\nBy 30 August, the Canadian and British Corps had reached the Green I main defensive positions running along the ridges on the far side of the Foglia river. Taking advantage of the Germans' lack of manpower, the Canadians punched through and by 3 September had advanced a further {{convert|15|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the Green II line of defences running from the coast near Riccione. The Allies were close to breaking through to Rimini and the Romagna plain. However, LXXVI ''Panzer'' Corps on the German 10th Army's left wing had withdrawn in good order behind the line of the [[Conca (river)|Conca river]].<ref>Orgill, p. 65.</ref> Fierce resistance from the Corps\u2032 1st Parachute Division\u2014commanded by Heidrich (supported by intense artillery fire from the Coriano ridge in the hills on the Canadians' left)\u2014brought their advance to a halt.\n\nMeanwhile, British V Corps was finding progress in the more difficult hill terrain with its poor roads tough going. On 3\u20134 September, while the Canadians once again attacked along the coastal plain, V Corps made an armoured thrust to dislodge the Coriano Ridge defences and reach the Marano river. This was to open the gate to the plain beyond which could be rapidly exploited by the tanks of British 1st Armoured Division, poised for this purpose. However, after two days of gruesome fighting with heavy losses on both sides, the Allies were obliged to call off their assault and reassess their strategy. Leese decided to outflank the Coriano ridge positions by driving westwards toward Croce and Gemmano to reach the Marano valley which curved behind the Coriano positions to the coast some {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} north of Riccione.\n\n===Battles for Gemmano and Croce===\nThe [[Battle of Gemmano]] has been nicknamed by some historians as the \"Cassino of the Adriatic\". After 11 assaults between 4 and 13 September (first by British 56th Division and then British 46th Division), it was the turn of Indian 4th Division who after a heavy bombardment made the 12th attack at 03:00 on 15 September and finally carried and secured the German defensive positions.<ref>Hingston, p. 129.</ref> In the meantime, to the north, on the other side of the Conca valley a similarly bloody engagement was being ground out at Croce. The German 98th Division held their positions with great tenacity, and it took five days of constant fighting, often door to door and hand to hand before the British 56th Division captured Croce.\n\n==={{anchor|Coriano}}Coriano taken and the advance to Rimini and San Marino===\n{{further|Battle of San Marino}}\n\nWith progress slow at Gemmano, Leese decided to renew the attack on Coriano. After a paralyzing bombardment from 700 artillery pieces<ref>Orgill, p. 124.</ref> and bombers, the Canadian 5th Armoured Division and the British 1st Armoured Division launched their attack on the night of 12 September. The Coriano positions were finally taken on 14 September.\n\nOnce again, the way was open to Rimini. Kesselring's forces had taken heavy losses, and three divisions of reinforcements ordered to the Adriatic front would not be available for at least a day. Now, the weather intervened: torrential rain turned the rivers into torrents and halted air support operations. Once again movement ground to a crawl, and the German defenders had the opportunity to reorganise and reinforce their positions on the Marano river, and the salient to the Lombardy plain closed. Once more, the Eighth Army was confronted by an organised line of defence, the Rimini Line.\n\nMeanwhile, with Croce and beyond it Montescudo secured, the left wing of the Eighth Army advanced to the Marano river and the frontier of [[San Marino]]. The Germans had occupied neutral San Marino over a week previously to take advantage of the heights on which the city-state stood. By 19 September, the city was isolated and [[Battle of San Marino|fell to the Allies]] with relatively little cost.<ref>Orgill, pp. 140\u2013141.</ref> {{convert|3|mi}} beyond San Marino lay the Marecchia valley running across the Eighth Army line of advance and running to the sea at Rimini.\n\nDuring the night of 19/20 September, Brigadier [[Richard Goodbody|Richard W. Goodbody]], commanding the [[2nd Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|2nd Armoured Brigade]], ordered (with many doubts) the [[2nd Dragoon Guards (Queen's Bays)]] to attack Pt 153 at 10.50. The German antitank gunners, using the renowned [[8.8 cm Flak 18/36/37/41|88mm guns]], had a field day. All but three [[M4 Sherman|Sherman tanks]] of the two squadrons that took part in the attack were destroyed. The Bays lost 24 tanks and, more important, 64 highly skilled tank crewmen. Fortunately for the [[9th Queen's Royal Lancers]], who had been ordered to pass through the Bays, their attack was postponed after strong representations had been made to higher HQ.<ref>War Monthly - Issue 34 (1977).

Progress for the Eighth Army became very slow with mud slides caused by the torrential rain making it difficult to keep roads and tracks open, creating a logistical nightmare. Although they were out of the hills, the plains were waterlogged and the Eighth Army found themselves confronted, as they had the previous autumn, by a succession of swollen rivers running across their line of advance.<ref>Orgill, p. 161.</ref> Once again, the conditions prevented Eighth Army's armour from exploiting the breakthrough, and the infantry of British V Corps and [[I Canadian Corps]] (joined by the 2nd New Zealand Division) had to grind their way forward while von Vietinghoff withdrew his forces behind the next river beyond the Marecchia, the Uso, a few miles beyond Rimini. The positions on the Uso were forced on 26 September, and Eighth Army reached the next river, the Fiumicino, on 29 September. Four days of heavy rain forced a halt, and by this time V Corps was fought out and required major reorganization.\n\nSince the start of Operation Olive, Eighth Army had suffered 14,000 casualties.{{Refn|group=nb|The British Official History gives V Corps casualties as 9,000 and Canadian casualties (referencing the Canadian Official History) as just under 4,000 up to 21 September.

Crittenberger]], on the left formed by the [[1st Armored Division (United States)|U.S. 1st Armored Division]], the [[6th Armoured Division (South Africa)|6th South African Armoured Division]] and two [[regimental combat team]]s (\"RCT\"), one of the [[92nd Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. 92nd Infantry Division]] the other the Brazilian 6th RCT (the first land forces contingent of the [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force]]); in the centre was [[II Corps (United States)|U.S. II Corps]], under Major General [[Geoffrey Keyes]], (with the U.S. [[34th Infantry Division (United States)|34th]], [[85th Infantry Division (United States)|85th]], [[88th Infantry Division (United States)|88th]] and [[91st Division (United States)|91st Infantry Divisions]] supported  by three tank battalions under command); and on the right [[XIII Corps (United Kingdom)|British XIII Corps]], under Lieutenant-General [[Sidney Kirkman]], (composed of the British [[1st Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|1st Infantry]] and [[6th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|6th Armoured Divisions]], the [[8th Infantry Division (India)|8th Indian Infantry Division]] and the [[1st Canadian Armoured Brigade]]). Like the Eighth Army, the Fifth Army was considered to be strong in armour and short on infantry considering the terrain they were attacking.<ref>Orgill, p. 164.</ref>\n\n===German formation in the central Apennines===\nIn the front line facing Clark's forces were five divisions of [[Joachim Lemelsen]]'s German 14th Army (20th ''Luftwaffe'' Field Division, [[16th SS Panzergrenadier Division Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS|16th SS ''Panzer'' Grenadier Division]] (16. ''Panzergrenadierdivision''), [[65th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|65th]] and [[362nd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|362nd Infantry Divisions]] and the [[4th Parachute Division (Germany)|4th Parachute Division]]) and two divisions on the western end of von Vietinghoff's German 10th Army ([[356th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|356th]] and [[715th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|715th Infantry Divisions]]). By the end of the first week in September, the ''Luftwaffe'' Field Division and the 356th Infantry Division had been moved to the Adriatic front along with (from army reserve) the [[29th Panzer Grenadier Division (Wehrmacht)|29th ''Panzer'' Grenadier Division]] and the armoured reserve of [[23rd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|26th ''Panzer'' Division]]. The 14th Army was not of the same quality as the 10th Army: it had been badly mauled in the [[Battle of Anzio|retreat from Anzio]] and some of its replacements had been hastily and inadequately trained.<ref>Orgill, pp. 164\u2013166.</ref>\n\n===Allied plan===\nClark's plan was for II Corps to strike along the road from Florence to [[Firenzuola]] and [[Imola]] through the Il Giogo pass to outflank the formidable defences of the Futa pass (on the main Florence\u2013Bologna road) while on their right British XIII Corps would advance through the Gothic Line to cut Route 9 (and therefore Kesselring's lateral communications) at [[Faenza]]. The transfer of 356th Infantry Division to the Adriatic weakened the defences around the Il Giogo pass which was already potentially an area of weakness, being on the boundary between 10th and 14th Armies.<ref>Orgill, p.165.</ref>\n\n===Battle===\n{{main|Battle of Rimini (1944)}}\nDuring the last week in August, U.S. II Corps and British XIII Corps started to move into the mountains to take up positions for the main assault on the main Gothic Line defences. Some fierce resistance was met from outposts but at the end of the first week in September, once reorganisation had taken place following the withdrawal of three divisions to reinforce the pressured Adriatic front, the Germans withdrew to the main Gothic Line defences. After an artillery bombardment, the Fifth Army's main assault began at dusk on 12 September. Keyes tried to flank the II Giogo Pass by attacking both the peaks of Monticello and Monte Altuzzo using the 91st Infantry Division in a bold attempt to bounce the Germans off the positions, but this failed.<ref>War Monthly - Issue 34 (1977). ''Gothic Line 1944'', by E. D. Smith, p. 30. {{ISSN|0307-2886}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:PicGiogioPass.jpg|thumb|290px|Top of Il Giogo Pass in the Gothic Line, looking toward the north.]]\n\nProgress at the II Giogo Pass was slow, but on II Corps' right British XIII Corps were making better progress. Clark grasped this opportunity to divert part of II Corps reserve (the [[337th Infantry Regiment (United States)|337th Infantry Regiment]], part of the [[85th Infantry Division (United States)|85th Infantry Division]]) to exploit XIII Corps success. Attacking on 17 September, supported by both American and British artillery, the infantry fought their way onto Monte Pratone, some {{convert|2|-|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of the Il Giogo pass and a key position on the Gothic Line.<ref>Orgill, p. 178.</ref> Meanwhile, U.S. II Corps renewed their assault on Monte Altuzzo, dominating the east side of the Il Giogo Pass. The Altuzzo positions fell on the morning of 17 September, after five days of fighting. The capture of Altuzzo and Pratone as well as Monte Verruca between them caused the formidable Futa Pass defences to be outflanked, and Lemelsen was forced to pull back, leaving the pass to be taken after only light fighting on 22 September.\n\nOn the left, IV Corps had fought their way to the main Gothic Line: notably the [[370th Infantry Regiment (United States)|U.S. 370th Regimental Combat Team]], which pushed the Axis troops on its sector to the north beyond the Highway 12 towards [[Gallicano]]; and the Brazilian 6th RCT, which took [[Massarosa]], [[Camaiore]] and other small towns on its own way north. By the end of the month, the Brazilian unit had conquered ''Monte Prano'' and controlled the [[Serchio]] valley region without suffering any major casualties. In October, it also took [[Fornaci di Barga|Fornaci]] with its munitions factory, and [[Barga]]; while the 370th received reinforcements from other units ([[356th Infantry Regiment (United States)|365th]] and [[371st Infantry Regiment (United States)|371st]]), to ensure the Fifth Army left wing sector at the [[Ligurian Sea]].<ref>Brooks, pp. 221 & 223.</ref><ref>Moraes, Chapter III, section \"Operations at Serchio Valley\".</ref>\n\nOn Fifth Army's far right wing, on the right of the British XIII Corps front, 8th Indian Infantry Division fighting across trackless ground had captured the heights of Femina Morta and British 6th Armoured Division had taken the San Godenzo Pass on Route 67 to [[Forl\u00ec]], both on 18 September.\n\nAt this stage, with the slow progress on the Adriatic front, Clark decided that Bologna would be too far west along Route 9 to trap the German 10th Army. He decided therefore to make the main II Corps thrust further east towards Imola whilst XIII Corps would continue to push on the right toward Faenza. Although they were through the Gothic Line, Fifth Army\u2014just like the Eighth Army before them\u2014found the terrain beyond and its defenders even more difficult. Between 21 September and 3 October, U.S. 88th Division had fought its way to a standstill on the route to Imola suffering 2,105 men killed and wounded \u2014 roughly the same as the whole of the rest of II Corps during the actual breaching of the Gothic Line.<ref>Orgill, p. 187.</ref>\n\nThe fighting toward Imola had drawn German troops from the defence of Bologna, and Clark decided to switch his main thrust back toward the Bologna axis. U.S. II Corps pushed steadily through the Raticosa Pass and by 2 October, it had reached [[Monghidoro]] some {{convert|20|mi|km|abbr=on}} from Bologna. However, as it had on the Adriatic coast, the weather had broken and rain and low cloud prevented air support while the roads back to the ever more distant supply dumps near Florence became morasses.<ref>Orgill, pp. 187\u2013188.</ref>\n\nOn 5 October, U.S. II Corps renewed its offensive along a {{convert|14|mi|km|adj=on}} front straddling Route 65 to Bologna. They were supported on their right flank by British XIII Corps including [[78th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|British 78th Infantry Division]], newly returned to Italy after a three-month re-fit in [[Egypt]]. Gradual progress was made against stiffening opposition as German 14th Army moved troops from the quieter sector opposite U.S. IV Corps. By 9 October, they were attacking the massive {{convert|1,500|ft}} high sheer escarpment behind Livergnano which appeared insuperable. However, the weather cleared on the morning of 10 October to allow artillery and air support to be brought to bear. Nevertheless, it took until the end of 15 October before the escarpment was secured.<ref>Orgill, p. 200.</ref> On the right of U.S. II Corps British XIII Corps was experiencing equally determined fighting on terrain just as difficult.\n\n==Time runs out for the Allied offensive==\nBy the second half of October, it was becoming increasingly clear to Alexander that despite the dogged fighting in the waterlogged plain of Romagna and the streaming mountains of the central Apennines, with the autumn well advanced and exhaustion and combat losses increasingly affecting his forces' capabilities, no breakthrough was going to occur before the winter weather returned.\n\nOn the Adriatic front, the British Eighth Army's advance resumed on its left wing through the Apennine foothills toward Forl\u00ec on Route 9. On 5 October the [[10th Indian Infantry Division]]\u2014switched from [[X Corps (United Kingdom)|British X Corps]] to British V Corps\u2014had crossed the Fiumicino river high in the hills and turned the German defensive line on the river forcing the German 10th Army units downstream to pull back towards Bologna. Paradoxically, in one sense, this helped Kesselring because it shortened the front he had to defend and shortened the distance between his two armies, providing him with greater flexibility to switch units between the two fronts. Continuing their push up Route 9, on 21 October British V Corps crossed the [[Savio (river)|Savio river]] which runs north eastward through [[Cesena]] to the Adriatic and by 25 October were closing on the Ronco river, some {{convert|10|mi|km|abbr=on}} beyond the Savio, behind which the Germans had withdrawn. By the end of the month, the advance had reached Forl\u00ec, halfway between Rimini and Bologna.\n\nCutting the German Armies' lateral communications remained a key objective. Indeed, later Kesselring was to say that if in mid-October the front south of Bologna could not be held, then all the German positions east of Bologna \"were automatically gone.\"<ref>Orgill, p. 210.</ref> Alexander and [[Mark W. Clark|Clark]] had decided therefore to make a last push for Bologna before winter gripped the front.\n\nOn 16 October, the U.S. Fifth Army had gathered itself for one last effort to take Bologna. The Allies were short of artillery ammunition because of a global reduction in Allied ammunition production in anticipation of the final defeat of Germany. The Fifth Army's batteries were rationed to such an extent that the total rounds fired in the last week of October were less than the amount fired during one eight-hour period on 2 October.<ref>Orgill, p. 213.</ref> Nevertheless, U.S. II Corps and [[XIII Corps (United Kingdom)|British XIII Corps]] pounded away for the next 11 days. Little progress was made in the centre along the main road to Bologna. On the right, there was better progress, and on 20 October the U.S. 88th Division seized Monte Grande, only {{convert|4|mi|km|abbr=on}} from Route 9, and three days later British 78th Division stormed Monte Spaduro. However, the remaining {{convert|4|mi}} were over difficult terrain and were reinforced by three of the best German divisions in Italy\u2014the 29th Panzergrenadier Division, 90th Panzergrenadier Division and the 1st Parachute Division]\u2014which Kesselring had been able to withdraw from the Romagna as a result of his shortened front. By late October, the Brazilian 6th RCT had pushed the Axis forces through [[Lucca (province)|province of Lucca]] to Barga, where its advance was halted.<ref>Brooks, pp. 223-24.</ref>\n\n==Later operations==\nIn early November, the buildup to full strength of the 1st Brazilian Division and some reinforcement of the U.S. 92nd Division had not nearly compensated the U.S. Fifth Army for the formations diverted to France. The situation in the British Eighth Army was even worse: Replacement cadres were being diverted to northern Europe and I Canadian Corps was ordered to prepare to ship to the Netherlands in February of the following year.<ref>Corrigan 2010, p.523</ref> Also, while they remained held in the mountains, the armies continued to have an over-preponderance of armour relative to infantry.<ref>Clark, p.606</ref>\n\nDuring November and December, Fifth Army concentrated on dislodging the Germans from their well-placed artillery positions which had been key in preventing the Allied advance towards Bologna and the [[Po Valley]]. Using small and medium Brazilian and American forces, the U.S. Fifth Army attacked these points one by one but with no positive outcome. By the end of the year, the defence compound formed by the Germans around [[Battle of Monte Castello|Monte Castello]], (''Lizano in'') [[Mount Belvedere|Belvedere]], Della Toraccia, Castelnuovo (di [[Vergato]]), Torre di Nerone, La Serra, Soprassasso and Castel D'Aiano had proved extremely resilient.<ref>Moraes, Chapter IV</ref><ref>Brooks, Chapters XX & XXI</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the British Eighth Army\u2014held on Route 9 at Forl\u00ec\u2014continued a subsidiary drive up the Adriatic coast and captured [[Ravenna]] on 5 November. In early November, the push up Route 9 resumed, and the river Montone, just beyond Forl\u00ec, was crossed on 9 November. However, the going continued to be very tough with the river Cosina, some {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} further along Route 9 being crossed only on 23 November. By 17 December, the river Lamone had been assaulted and [[Faenza]] cleared.<ref>Blaxland, pp. 227\u2013236.</ref> The German 10th Army established itself on the raised banks of the [[Senio River|river Senio]] (rising at least {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}} above the surrounding plain) which ran across the line of the Eighth Army advance just beyond Faenza down to the Adriatic north of Ravenna. With snows falling and winter firmly established, any attempt to cross the Senio was out of the question and the Eighth Army's 1944 campaign came to an end.<ref>Carver, pp. 266\u2013267.</ref>\n\nIn late December, in a final flourish to the year's fighting, the Germans used a predominantly Italian force of units from the Italian Monterosa Division to [[Battle of Garfagnana|attack the left wing of the U.S. Fifth Army]] in the Serchio valley in front of Lucca to pin Allied units there which might otherwise have been switched to the central front. Two brigades of the 8th Indian Infantry Division were rapidly switched across the Apennines to reinforce the U.S. 92nd Infantry Division. By the time the reinforcements had arrived, the Axis forces had broken through to capture Barga, but decisive action by the 8th Indian Division's [[Major-general (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] [[Dudley Russell]] halted further advance and the situation was stabilised and Barga recaptured by the New Year.<ref>{{cite book | last = Moseley | first = Ray | title = Mussolini : the last 600 days of il Duce | publisher = Taylor Trade Pub | location = Dallas | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-1-58979-095-7 | url = https://archive.org/details/mussolinilast60000mose }} [https://archive.org/details/mussolinilast60000mose/page/156 <!-- quote=Lucca mussolini offensive. --> p. 156]</ref>\n\nIn mid-December Alexander became supreme commander of the [[Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II|Mediterranean Theatre]].

It formed [[Generalfeldmarschall|Field Marshal]] [[Albert Kesselring]]'s last major line of defence along the summits of the northern part of the [[Apennine Mountains]] during the fighting retreat of the [[Wehrmacht|German forces]] in [[Italian Social Republic|Italy]] against the [[Allied Armies in Italy]], commanded by [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Sir Harold Alexander]].\n\n[[Adolf Hitler]] had concerns about the state of preparation of the Gothic Line: he feared the Allies would use [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious landings]] to [[flanking maneuver|outflank]] its defences. To downgrade its importance in the eyes of both friend and foe, he ordered the name, with its historic connotations, changed, reasoning that if the Allies managed to break through they would not be able to use the more impressive name to magnify their victory claims. In response to this order, Kesselring renamed it the \"'''Green Line'''\" (''Gr\u00fcne Linie'') in June 1944.\n\nUsing more than 15,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|slave labourers]], the Germans created more than 2,000 well-fortified [[machine gun nest]]s, [[casemate]]s, [[bunker]]s, [[observation post]]s and artillery fighting positions to repel any attempt to breach the Gothic Line.<ref>Sterner, 2008. p.106</ref> Initially this line was breached during Operation Olive (also sometimes known as the [[Battle of Rimini (1944)|Battle of Rimini]]), but Kesselring's forces were consistently able to retire in good order. This continued to be the case up to March 1945, with the Gothic Line being breached but with no decisive breakthrough; this would not take place until April 1945 during [[Spring 1945 offensive in Italy|the final Allied offensive]] of the Italian Campaign.<ref>Bryn, Chapter 14.</ref>\n\nOperation Olive has been described as the biggest battle of materials ever fought in Italy. Over 1,200,000 men participated in the battle. The battle took the form of a [[Pincer movement|pincer manoeuvre]], carried out by the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]] and the [[United States Army North|U.S. Fifth Army]] against the [[10th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 10th Army]] (10. ''Armee'') and [[14th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 14th Army]] (14. ''Armee''). [[Rimini]], a city which had been hit by previous air raids, had 1,470,000 rounds fired against it by allied land forces. According to [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]] [[Oliver Leese]], commander of the British Eighth Army:\n\n{{quote|The battle of Rimini was one of the hardest battles of Eighth Army. The fighting was comparable to [[Second Battle of El Alamein|El Alamein]], [[Battle of the Mareth Line|Mareth]] and the [[Battle of Monte Cassino|Gustav Line (Monte-Cassino)]].}}\n\n==Background==\nAfter the nearly concurrent breakthroughs at [[Battle of Monte Cassino|Cassino]] and [[Battle of Anzio|Anzio]] in spring 1944, the 11 nations representing the Allies in Italy finally had a chance to trap the Germans in a [[pincer movement]] and to realize some of the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]]'s strategic goals for the long, costly campaign against the [[Axis powers|Axis]] \"underbelly\". This would have required the [[United States Army North|U.S. Fifth Army]] under [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Mark W. Clark]] to commit most of his Anzio forces to the drive east from [[Cisterna di Latina|Cisterna]], and to execute the envelopment envisioned in the original planning for the Anzio landing (i.e., flank the [[10th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 10th Army]], and sever its northbound line of retreat from Cassino). Instead, fearing that the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]], under [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]] [[Oliver Leese|Sir Oliver Leese]], might beat him to the Italian capital of [[Rome]], Clark diverted a large part of his Anzio force in that direction in an attempt to ensure that he and the Fifth Army would have the honour of liberating the city.\n\nAs a result, most of ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' [[Albert Kesselring]]'s forces slipped the noose and fell back north fighting delaying actions, notably in late June on the [[Trasimene Line]] (running from just south of [[Ancona]] on the east coast, past the southern shores of [[Lake Trasimeno]] near [[Perugia]] and on to the west coast south of [[Grosseto]]) and in July on the [[Arno Line]] (running from the west coast along the line of the [[Arno|Arno River]] and into the [[Apennine Mountains]] north of [[Arezzo]]). This gave time to consolidate the Gothic Line, a {{convert|10|mi|km}} deep belt of fortifications extending from south of [[La Spezia]] (on the west coast) to the [[Foglia River|Foglia Valley]], through the natural defensive wall of the Apennines (which ran unbroken nearly from coast to coast, {{convert|50|mi|km}} deep and with high crests and peaks rising to {{convert|7000|ft|m}}), to the [[Adriatic Sea]] between [[Pesaro]] and [[Ravenna]], on the east coast. The emplacements included numerous concrete-reinforced gun pits and trenches and 2,376 machine-gun nests with interlocking fire, 479 anti-tank, mortar and assault gun positions, {{convert|120000|m|yd}} of barbed wire and many miles of anti-tank ditches.<ref>Orgill, p. 28.</ref> This last redoubt proved the Germans' determination to continue fighting.\n\nNevertheless, it was fortunate for the Allies that at this stage of the war the [[Italian resistance movement|Italian partisan]] forces had become highly effective in disrupting the German preparations in the high mountains. By September 1944, German generals were no longer able to move freely in the area behind their main lines because of partisan activity. ''[[Generalleutnant]]'' [[Frido von Senger und Etterlin]]\u2014commanding [[XIV Panzer Corps|XIV ''Panzer'' Corps]] (''XIV Panzerkorps'')\u2014later wrote that he had taken to travelling in a little Volkswagen \"(displaying) no general's insignia of rank\u2014no peaked cap, no gold or red flags...\". One of his colleagues who ignored this caution\u2014[[Wilhelm Crisolli]] (commanding the [[20th Luftwaffe Field Division (Germany)|20th ''Luftwaffe'' Field Division]])\u2014was caught and killed by partisans as he returned from a conference at corps headquarters.<ref>Orgill, p. 36.</ref>\n\nConstruction of the defences was also hampered by the deliberately poor quality concrete provided by local Italian mills whilst captured partisans forced into the construction gangs supplemented the natural lethargy of forced labour with clever sabotage. Nevertheless, prior to the Allies' attack, Kesselring had declared himself satisfied with the work done, especially on the Adriatic side where he \"...contemplated an assault on the left wing....with a certain confidence\".<ref>Orgill, p. 29.</ref>\n\n===Allied strategy===\n{{further|Gothic Line order of battle}}\n\nThe Italian Front was seen by the Allies to be of secondary importance to the [[Operation Overlord|offensives through France]], and this was underlined by the withdrawal during the summer of 1944 of seven divisions from the U.S. Fifth Army to take part in the landings in southern France, [[Operation Dragoon]]. By 5 August, the strength of the Fifth Army had fallen from 249,000 to 153,000,<ref>Orgill, p. 20.</ref> and they had only 18 divisions to confront the combined German 10th and [[14th Army (Wehrmacht)|14th Armies]]\u2032 strength of 14 divisions plus four to seven reserve divisions.\n\nNevertheless, Winston Churchill and the British Chiefs of Staff were keen to break through the German defences to open up the route to the northeast through the \"Ljubljana Gap\" into [[National Socialist Austria|Austria]] and [[Hungary during World War II|Hungary]]. Whilst this would threaten Germany from the rear, Churchill was more concerned to forestall the [[Red Army|Russians]] advancing into central Europe. The U.S. Chiefs of Staff had strongly opposed this strategy as diluting the Allied focus in France. However, following the Allied successes in France during the summer, the U.S. Chiefs relented, and there was complete agreement amongst the [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]] at the [[Second Quebec Conference]] on 12 September.<ref>Orgill, pp. 114\u2013115.</ref>\n\n===Allied plan of attack===\n<!-- Operation Olive redirects here, please change the redirect if the section name is altered -->\nThe original plan of [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Sir Harold Alexander]], the [[Commander-in-chief|Commander-in-Chief]] (C-in-C) of the [[Allied Armies in Italy]] (AAI)\u2014as formulated by his [[Chief of staff|Chief of Staff]], [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]] [[John Harding, 1st Baron Harding of Petherton|Sir John Harding]]\u2014was to storm the Gothic Line in the centre, where most of [[Gothic Line order of battle|his forces]] were already concentrated. It was the shortest route to his objective, the plains of [[Lombardy]], and could be mounted quickly. He mounted a deception operation to convince the Germans that the main blow would come on the Adriatic front.\n\n[[File:Gothic Line - Concept of OperationOlive 1944.png|thumb|380px|The Gothic Line, August 1944 and the concept of Operation Olive. The dark blue arrows represent major Allied attacks.]]\n\nOn 4 August, Alexander met Lieutenant-General Leese, the British Eighth Army commander, to find that Leese did not favour the plan.<ref>Jackson, p. 119.</ref> He argued that the Allies had lost their specialist [[French Expeditionary Corps (1943\u201344)|French mountain troops]] to [[Operation Dragoon]] and that the Eighth Army's strength lay in tactics combining infantry, armour and guns which could not be employed in the high mountains of the central Apennines.\n\nIt has also been suggested that Leese disliked working in league with Clark after the Fifth Army's controversial move on Rome at the end of May and early June and wished for the Eighth Army to win the battle on its own.<ref>Blaxland, p. 163.</ref> He suggested a surprise attack along the Adriatic coast. Although Harding did not share Leese's view and Eighth Army planning staff had already rejected the idea of an Adriatic offensive (because it would be difficult to bring the necessary concentration of forces to bear), General Alexander was not prepared to force Leese to adopt a plan which was against his inclination and judgement<ref>Orgill, p. 33.</ref> and Harding was persuaded to change his mind.\n\nOperation Olive\u2014as the new offensive was christened\u2014called for Leese's Eighth Army to attack up the Adriatic coast toward [[Pesaro]] and [[Rimini]] and draw in the German reserves from the centre of the country. Clark's Fifth Army would then attack in the weakened central Apennines north of [[Florence]] toward [[Bologna]] with [[XIII Corps (United Kingdom)|British XIII Corps]] on the right wing of the attack fanning toward the coast to create a pincer with the Eighth Army advance. This meant that as a preparatory move, the bulk of the Eighth Army had to be transferred from the centre of Italy to the Adriatic coast, taking two valuable weeks, while a new intelligence deception plan (Operation Ulster)<ref>Jackson, p. 126.</ref> was commenced to convince Kesselring that the main attack would be in the centre.\n\n==Adriatic Front (British Eighth Army)==\n\n===Eighth Army dispositions for Operation Olive===\n[[File:The British Army in Italy 1944 NA18091.jpg|thumb|A British [[M10 tank destroyer]] Self Propelled Gun (SPG) and infantrymen of the 5th Battalion, [[Sherwood Foresters]] during the advance to the Gothic Line, 27\u201328 August 1944.]]\n\nOn the coast, Leese had [[II Corps (Poland)|Polish II Corps]] with [[5th Kresowa Infantry Division|5th Kresowa Division]] in the front line and the [[3rd Carpathian Rifle Division (Poland)|3rd Carpathian Division]] in reserve. To the left of the Poles was [[I Canadian Corps|Canadian I Corps]] which had the [[1st Canadian Division|Canadian 1st Infantry Division]] (with the [[21st Army Tank Brigade|British 21st Tank Brigade]] under command) in the front line and the [[5th Canadian Division|Canadian 5th Armoured Division]] in reserve.\n\nFor the opening phase the corps artillery was strengthened with the addition of the [[4th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|British 4th Infantry Division]]'s artillery. West of the Canadians was [[V Corps (United Kingdom)|British V Corps]] with the [[46th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|British 46th Infantry Division]] manning the right of the corps front line and [[4th Infantry Division (India)|4th Indian Infantry Division]] its left. In reserve were the British [[56th (London) Infantry Division|56th Infantry]] and [[1st (United Kingdom) Division|1st Armoured Divisions]] and the British [[7th Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|7th Armoured]] and [[25th Army Tank Brigade|25th Tank Brigades]].\n\nFurther to the rear was the British 4th Division, waiting to be called forward to join the corps. The left flank of the Eighth Army front was guarded by [[X Corps (United Kingdom)|British X Corps]] employing the [[10th Indian Infantry Division]] and two armoured car regiments, [[12th Royal Lancers|12th]] and [[27th Lancers]]. Prior to the attack the I Canadian Corps' front was covered by patrolling Polish cavalry units and V Corps by patrolling elements of the Italian Liberation Corps. In army reserve, also waiting to be called forward, was the [[2nd New Zealand Division]].<ref>Jackson, p. 226.</ref>\n\n===German 10th Army dispositions===\nFacing the Eighth Army was the German 10th Army's [[LXXVI Panzer Corps|LXXVI ''Panzer'' Corps]] (''LXXVI Panzerkorps''). Initially, this had only three divisions: [[1st Parachute Division (Germany)|1st Parachute Division]] facing the Poles, [[71st Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|71st Infantry Division]] (''71. Infantriedivision'') inland on the parachute division's right and [[278th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|278th Division]] (''278. Infantriedivision'') on the Corps right flank in the hills which was in the process of relieving [[5th Mountain Division (Wehrmacht)|5th Mountain Division]]. The 10th Army had a further five divisions in [[51st Mountain Corps]] covering {{convert|80|mi|km|abbr=on}} of front line on the right of LXVI ''Panzer'' Corps and a further two divisions\u2014[[162nd Turkoman Division|162nd Infantry Division]] (''162.

Panzergrenadierdivision'') from 25 August)\u2014covering the Adriatic coast behind LXVI Corps. In addition, Kesselring had in his Army Group Reserve the [[90th Light Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|90th ''Panzer'' Grenadier Division]] (''90. Panzergrenadierdivision'') and [[23rd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|26th ''Panzer'' Division]] (''26. Panzerdivision'').<ref>Jackson, p. 227.</ref>\n\n===Eighth Army attack===\nThe British Eighth Army crossed the Metauro river and launched its attack against the Gothic Line outposts on 25 August. As Polish II Corps, on the coast and I Canadian Corps, on the coastal plain on the Poles' left, advanced towards Pesaro the coastal plain narrowed and it was planned that the Polish Corps, weakened by losses and lack of replacements, would go into Army reserve and the front on the coastal plain would become the responsibility of the Canadian Corps alone. The Germans were taken by surprise, to the extent that both von Vietinghoff, and the parachute division's commander\u2014''[[Generalmajor]] '' [[Richard Heidrich]]\u2014were away on leave.<ref name=\"Jackson234\">Jackson, p. 234.</ref>\n\nThey were in the process of pulling back their forward units to the Green I fortifications of the Gothic Line proper and Kesselring was uncertain whether this was the start of a major offensive or just Eighth Army advancing to occupy vacated ground whilst the main Allied attack would come on the U.S. Fifth Army front towards Bologna. On 27 August, he was still expressing the view that the attack was a diversion and so would not commit reserves to the front.<ref name=\"Jackson234\"/> It was not until 28 August\u2014when he saw a captured copy of Leese's order of the day to his army prior to the attack\u2014that Kesselring realised that a major offensive was in progress,<ref>Orgill, pp. 46\u201347.</ref> and three divisions of reinforcements were ordered from Bologna to the Adriatic front, still needing at least two days to get into position.\n\nBy 30 August, the Canadian and British Corps had reached the Green I main defensive positions running along the ridges on the far side of the Foglia river. Taking advantage of the Germans' lack of manpower, the Canadians punched through and by 3 September had advanced a further {{convert|15|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the Green II line of defences running from the coast near Riccione. The Allies were close to breaking through to Rimini and the Romagna plain. However, LXXVI ''Panzer'' Corps on the German 10th Army's left wing had withdrawn in good order behind the line of the [[Conca (river)|Conca river]].<ref>Orgill, p. 65.</ref> Fierce resistance from the Corps\u2032 1st Parachute Division\u2014commanded by Heidrich (supported by intense artillery fire from the Coriano ridge in the hills on the Canadians' left)\u2014brought their advance to a halt.\n\nMeanwhile, British V Corps was finding progress in the more difficult hill terrain with its poor roads tough going. On 3\u20134 September, while the Canadians once again attacked along the coastal plain, V Corps made an armoured thrust to dislodge the Coriano Ridge defences and reach the Marano river. This was to open the gate to the plain beyond which could be rapidly exploited by the tanks of British 1st Armoured Division, poised for this purpose. However, after two days of gruesome fighting with heavy losses on both sides, the Allies were obliged to call off their assault and reassess their strategy. Leese decided to outflank the Coriano ridge positions by driving westwards toward Croce and Gemmano to reach the Marano valley which curved behind the Coriano positions to the coast some {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} north of Riccione.\n\n===Battles for Gemmano and Croce===\nThe [[Battle of Gemmano]] has been nicknamed by some historians as the \"Cassino of the Adriatic\". After 11 assaults between 4 and 13 September (first by British 56th Division and then British 46th Division), it was the turn of Indian 4th Division who after a heavy bombardment made the 12th attack at 03:00 on 15 September and finally carried and secured the German defensive positions.<ref>Hingston, p. 129.</ref> In the meantime, to the north, on the other side of the Conca valley a similarly bloody engagement was being ground out at Croce. The German 98th Division held their positions with great tenacity, and it took five days of constant fighting, often door to door and hand to hand before the British 56th Division captured Croce.\n\n==={{anchor|Coriano}}Coriano taken and the advance to Rimini and San Marino===\n{{further|Battle of San Marino}}\n\nWith progress slow at Gemmano, Leese decided to renew the attack on Coriano. After a paralyzing bombardment from 700 artillery pieces<ref>Orgill, p. 124.</ref> and bombers, the Canadian 5th Armoured Division and the British 1st Armoured Division launched their attack on the night of 12 September. The Coriano positions were finally taken on 14 September.\n\nOnce again, the way was open to Rimini. Kesselring's forces had taken heavy losses, and three divisions of reinforcements ordered to the Adriatic front would not be available for at least a day. Now, the weather intervened: torrential rain turned the rivers into torrents and halted air support operations. Once again movement ground to a crawl, and the German defenders had the opportunity to reorganise and reinforce their positions on the Marano river, and the salient to the Lombardy plain closed. Once more, the Eighth Army was confronted by an organised line of defence, the Rimini Line.\n\nMeanwhile, with Croce and beyond it Montescudo secured, the left wing of the Eighth Army advanced to the Marano river and the frontier of [[San Marino]]. The Germans had occupied neutral San Marino over a week previously to take advantage of the heights on which the city-state stood. By 19 September, the city was isolated and [[Battle of San Marino|fell to the Allies]] with relatively little cost.<ref>Orgill, pp. 140\u2013141.</ref> {{convert|3|mi}} beyond San Marino lay the Marecchia valley running across the Eighth Army line of advance and running to the sea at Rimini.\n\nDuring the night of 19/20 September, Brigadier [[Richard Goodbody|Richard W. Goodbody]], commanding the [[2nd Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|2nd Armoured Brigade]], ordered (with many doubts) the [[2nd Dragoon Guards (Queen's Bays)]] to attack Pt 153 at 10.50. The German antitank gunners, using the renowned [[8.8 cm Flak 18/36/37/41|88mm guns]], had a field day. All but three [[M4 Sherman|Sherman tanks]] of the two squadrons that took part in the attack were destroyed. The Bays lost 24 tanks and, more important, 64 highly skilled tank crewmen. Fortunately for the [[9th Queen's Royal Lancers]], who had been ordered to pass through the Bays, their attack was postponed after strong representations had been made to higher HQ.<ref>War Monthly - Issue 34 (1977).

Progress for the Eighth Army became very slow with mud slides caused by the torrential rain making it difficult to keep roads and tracks open, creating a logistical nightmare. Although they were out of the hills, the plains were waterlogged and the Eighth Army found themselves confronted, as they had the previous autumn, by a succession of swollen rivers running across their line of advance.<ref>Orgill, p. 161.</ref> Once again, the conditions prevented Eighth Army's armour from exploiting the breakthrough, and the infantry of British V Corps and [[I Canadian Corps]] (joined by the 2nd New Zealand Division) had to grind their way forward while von Vietinghoff withdrew his forces behind the next river beyond the Marecchia, the Uso, a few miles beyond Rimini. The positions on the Uso were forced on 26 September, and Eighth Army reached the next river, the Fiumicino, on 29 September. Four days of heavy rain forced a halt, and by this time V Corps was fought out and required major reorganization.\n\nSince the start of Operation Olive, Eighth Army had suffered 14,000 casualties.{{Refn|group=nb|The British Official History gives V Corps casualties as 9,000 and Canadian casualties (referencing the Canadian Official History) as just under 4,000 up to 21 September.

Crittenberger]], on the left formed by the [[1st Armored Division (United States)|U.S. 1st Armored Division]], the [[6th Armoured Division (South Africa)|6th South African Armoured Division]] and two [[regimental combat team]]s (\"RCT\"), one of the [[92nd Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. 92nd Infantry Division]] the other the Brazilian 6th RCT (the first land forces contingent of the [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force]]); in the centre was [[II Corps (United States)|U.S. II Corps]], under Major General [[Geoffrey Keyes]], (with the U.S. [[34th Infantry Division (United States)|34th]], [[85th Infantry Division (United States)|85th]], [[88th Infantry Division (United States)|88th]] and [[91st Division (United States)|91st Infantry Divisions]] supported  by three tank battalions under command); and on the right [[XIII Corps (United Kingdom)|British XIII Corps]], under Lieutenant-General [[Sidney Kirkman]], (composed of the British [[1st Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|1st Infantry]] and [[6th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|6th Armoured Divisions]], the [[8th Infantry Division (India)|8th Indian Infantry Division]] and the [[1st Canadian Armoured Brigade]]). Like the Eighth Army, the Fifth Army was considered to be strong in armour and short on infantry considering the terrain they were attacking.<ref>Orgill, p. 164.</ref>\n\n===German formation in the central Apennines===\nIn the front line facing Clark's forces were five divisions of [[Joachim Lemelsen]]'s German 14th Army (20th ''Luftwaffe'' Field Division, [[16th SS Panzergrenadier Division Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS|16th SS ''Panzer'' Grenadier Division]] (16. ''Panzergrenadierdivision''), [[65th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|65th]] and [[362nd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|362nd Infantry Divisions]] and the [[4th Parachute Division (Germany)|4th Parachute Division]]) and two divisions on the western end of von Vietinghoff's German 10th Army ([[356th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|356th]] and [[715th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|715th Infantry Divisions]]). By the end of the first week in September, the ''Luftwaffe'' Field Division and the 356th Infantry Division had been moved to the Adriatic front along with (from army reserve) the [[29th Panzer Grenadier Division (Wehrmacht)|29th ''Panzer'' Grenadier Division]] and the armoured reserve of [[23rd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|26th ''Panzer'' Division]]. The 14th Army was not of the same quality as the 10th Army: it had been badly mauled in the [[Battle of Anzio|retreat from Anzio]] and some of its replacements had been hastily and inadequately trained.<ref>Orgill, pp. 164\u2013166.</ref>\n\n===Allied plan===\nClark's plan was for II Corps to strike along the road from Florence to [[Firenzuola]] and [[Imola]] through the Il Giogo pass to outflank the formidable defences of the Futa pass (on the main Florence\u2013Bologna road) while on their right British XIII Corps would advance through the Gothic Line to cut Route 9 (and therefore Kesselring's lateral communications) at [[Faenza]]. The transfer of 356th Infantry Division to the Adriatic weakened the defences around the Il Giogo pass which was already potentially an area of weakness, being on the boundary between 10th and 14th Armies.<ref>Orgill, p.165.</ref>\n\n===Battle===\n{{main|Battle of Rimini (1944)}}\nDuring the last week in August, U.S. II Corps and British XIII Corps started to move into the mountains to take up positions for the main assault on the main Gothic Line defences. Some fierce resistance was met from outposts but at the end of the first week in September, once reorganisation had taken place following the withdrawal of three divisions to reinforce the pressured Adriatic front, the Germans withdrew to the main Gothic Line defences. After an artillery bombardment, the Fifth Army's main assault began at dusk on 12 September. Keyes tried to flank the II Giogo Pass by attacking both the peaks of Monticello and Monte Altuzzo using the 91st Infantry Division in a bold attempt to bounce the Germans off the positions, but this failed.<ref>War Monthly - Issue 34 (1977). ''Gothic Line 1944'', by E. D. Smith, p. 30. {{ISSN|0307-2886}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:PicGiogioPass.jpg|thumb|290px|Top of Il Giogo Pass in the Gothic Line, looking toward the north.]]\n\nProgress at the II Giogo Pass was slow, but on II Corps' right British XIII Corps were making better progress. Clark grasped this opportunity to divert part of II Corps reserve (the [[337th Infantry Regiment (United States)|337th Infantry Regiment]], part of the [[85th Infantry Division (United States)|85th Infantry Division]]) to exploit XIII Corps success. Attacking on 17 September, supported by both American and British artillery, the infantry fought their way onto Monte Pratone, some {{convert|2|-|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of the Il Giogo pass and a key position on the Gothic Line.<ref>Orgill, p. 178.</ref> Meanwhile, U.S. II Corps renewed their assault on Monte Altuzzo, dominating the east side of the Il Giogo Pass. The Altuzzo positions fell on the morning of 17 September, after five days of fighting. The capture of Altuzzo and Pratone as well as Monte Verruca between them caused the formidable Futa Pass defences to be outflanked, and Lemelsen was forced to pull back, leaving the pass to be taken after only light fighting on 22 September.\n\nOn the left, IV Corps had fought their way to the main Gothic Line: notably the [[370th Infantry Regiment (United States)|U.S. 370th Regimental Combat Team]], which pushed the Axis troops on its sector to the north beyond the Highway 12 towards [[Gallicano]]; and the Brazilian 6th RCT, which took [[Massarosa]], [[Camaiore]] and other small towns on its own way north. By the end of the month, the Brazilian unit had conquered ''Monte Prano'' and controlled the [[Serchio]] valley region without suffering any major casualties. In October, it also took [[Fornaci di Barga|Fornaci]] with its munitions factory, and [[Barga]]; while the 370th received reinforcements from other units ([[356th Infantry Regiment (United States)|365th]] and [[371st Infantry Regiment (United States)|371st]]), to ensure the Fifth Army left wing sector at the [[Ligurian Sea]].<ref>Brooks, pp. 221 & 223.</ref><ref>Moraes, Chapter III, section \"Operations at Serchio Valley\".</ref>\n\nOn Fifth Army's far right wing, on the right of the British XIII Corps front, 8th Indian Infantry Division fighting across trackless ground had captured the heights of Femina Morta and British 6th Armoured Division had taken the San Godenzo Pass on Route 67 to [[Forl\u00ec]], both on 18 September.\n\nAt this stage, with the slow progress on the Adriatic front, Clark decided that Bologna would be too far west along Route 9 to trap the German 10th Army. He decided therefore to make the main II Corps thrust further east towards Imola whilst XIII Corps would continue to push on the right toward Faenza. Although they were through the Gothic Line, Fifth Army\u2014just like the Eighth Army before them\u2014found the terrain beyond and its defenders even more difficult. Between 21 September and 3 October, U.S. 88th Division had fought its way to a standstill on the route to Imola suffering 2,105 men killed and wounded \u2014 roughly the same as the whole of the rest of II Corps during the actual breaching of the Gothic Line.<ref>Orgill, p. 187.</ref>\n\nThe fighting toward Imola had drawn German troops from the defence of Bologna, and Clark decided to switch his main thrust back toward the Bologna axis. U.S. II Corps pushed steadily through the Raticosa Pass and by 2 October, it had reached [[Monghidoro]] some {{convert|20|mi|km|abbr=on}} from Bologna. However, as it had on the Adriatic coast, the weather had broken and rain and low cloud prevented air support while the roads back to the ever more distant supply dumps near Florence became morasses.<ref>Orgill, pp. 187\u2013188.</ref>\n\nOn 5 October, U.S. II Corps renewed its offensive along a {{convert|14|mi|km|adj=on}} front straddling Route 65 to Bologna. They were supported on their right flank by British XIII Corps including [[78th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|British 78th Infantry Division]], newly returned to Italy after a three-month re-fit in [[Egypt]]. Gradual progress was made against stiffening opposition as German 14th Army moved troops from the quieter sector opposite U.S. IV Corps. By 9 October, they were attacking the massive {{convert|1,500|ft}} high sheer escarpment behind Livergnano which appeared insuperable. However, the weather cleared on the morning of 10 October to allow artillery and air support to be brought to bear. Nevertheless, it took until the end of 15 October before the escarpment was secured.<ref>Orgill, p. 200.</ref> On the right of U.S. II Corps British XIII Corps was experiencing equally determined fighting on terrain just as difficult.\n\n==Time runs out for the Allied offensive==\nBy the second half of October, it was becoming increasingly clear to Alexander that despite the dogged fighting in the waterlogged plain of Romagna and the streaming mountains of the central Apennines, with the autumn well advanced and exhaustion and combat losses increasingly affecting his forces' capabilities, no breakthrough was going to occur before the winter weather returned.\n\nOn the Adriatic front, the British Eighth Army's advance resumed on its left wing through the Apennine foothills toward Forl\u00ec on Route 9. On 5 October the [[10th Indian Infantry Division]]\u2014switched from [[X Corps (United Kingdom)|British X Corps]] to British V Corps\u2014had crossed the Fiumicino river high in the hills and turned the German defensive line on the river forcing the German 10th Army units downstream to pull back towards Bologna. Paradoxically, in one sense, this helped Kesselring because it shortened the front he had to defend and shortened the distance between his two armies, providing him with greater flexibility to switch units between the two fronts. Continuing their push up Route 9, on 21 October British V Corps crossed the [[Savio (river)|Savio river]] which runs north eastward through [[Cesena]] to the Adriatic and by 25 October were closing on the Ronco river, some {{convert|10|mi|km|abbr=on}} beyond the Savio, behind which the Germans had withdrawn. By the end of the month, the advance had reached Forl\u00ec, halfway between Rimini and Bologna.\n\nCutting the German Armies' lateral communications remained a key objective. Indeed, later Kesselring was to say that if in mid-October the front south of Bologna could not be held, then all the German positions east of Bologna \"were automatically gone.\"<ref>Orgill, p. 210.</ref> Alexander and [[Mark W. Clark|Clark]] had decided therefore to make a last push for Bologna before winter gripped the front.\n\nOn 16 October, the U.S. Fifth Army had gathered itself for one last effort to take Bologna. The Allies were short of artillery ammunition because of a global reduction in Allied ammunition production in anticipation of the final defeat of Germany. The Fifth Army's batteries were rationed to such an extent that the total rounds fired in the last week of October were less than the amount fired during one eight-hour period on 2 October.<ref>Orgill, p. 213.</ref> Nevertheless, U.S. II Corps and [[XIII Corps (United Kingdom)|British XIII Corps]] pounded away for the next 11 days. Little progress was made in the centre along the main road to Bologna. On the right, there was better progress, and on 20 October the U.S. 88th Division seized Monte Grande, only {{convert|4|mi|km|abbr=on}} from Route 9, and three days later British 78th Division stormed Monte Spaduro. However, the remaining {{convert|4|mi}} were over difficult terrain and were reinforced by three of the best German divisions in Italy\u2014the 29th Panzergrenadier Division, 90th Panzergrenadier Division and the 1st Parachute Division]\u2014which Kesselring had been able to withdraw from the Romagna as a result of his shortened front. By late October, the Brazilian 6th RCT had pushed the Axis forces through [[Lucca (province)|province of Lucca]] to Barga, where its advance was halted.<ref>Brooks, pp. 223-24.</ref>\n\n==Later operations==\nIn early November, the buildup to full strength of the 1st Brazilian Division and some reinforcement of the U.S. 92nd Division had not nearly compensated the U.S. Fifth Army for the formations diverted to France. The situation in the British Eighth Army was even worse: Replacement cadres were being diverted to northern Europe and I Canadian Corps was ordered to prepare to ship to the Netherlands in February of the following year.<ref>Corrigan 2010, p.523</ref> Also, while they remained held in the mountains, the armies continued to have an over-preponderance of armour relative to infantry.<ref>Clark, p.606</ref>\n\nDuring November and December, Fifth Army concentrated on dislodging the Germans from their well-placed artillery positions which had been key in preventing the Allied advance towards Bologna and the [[Po Valley]]. Using small and medium Brazilian and American forces, the U.S. Fifth Army attacked these points one by one but with no positive outcome. By the end of the year, the defence compound formed by the Germans around [[Battle of Monte Castello|Monte Castello]], (''Lizano in'') [[Mount Belvedere|Belvedere]], Della Toraccia, Castelnuovo (di [[Vergato]]), Torre di Nerone, La Serra, Soprassasso and Castel D'Aiano had proved extremely resilient.<ref>Moraes, Chapter IV</ref><ref>Brooks, Chapters XX & XXI</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the British Eighth Army\u2014held on Route 9 at Forl\u00ec\u2014continued a subsidiary drive up the Adriatic coast and captured [[Ravenna]] on 5 November. In early November, the push up Route 9 resumed, and the river Montone, just beyond Forl\u00ec, was crossed on 9 November. However, the going continued to be very tough with the river Cosina, some {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} further along Route 9 being crossed only on 23 November. By 17 December, the river Lamone had been assaulted and [[Faenza]] cleared.<ref>Blaxland, pp. 227\u2013236.</ref> The German 10th Army established itself on the raised banks of the [[Senio River|river Senio]] (rising at least {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}} above the surrounding plain) which ran across the line of the Eighth Army advance just beyond Faenza down to the Adriatic north of Ravenna. With snows falling and winter firmly established, any attempt to cross the Senio was out of the question and the Eighth Army's 1944 campaign came to an end.<ref>Carver, pp. 266\u2013267.</ref>\n\nIn late December, in a final flourish to the year's fighting, the Germans used a predominantly Italian force of units from the Italian Monterosa Division to [[Battle of Garfagnana|attack the left wing of the U.S. Fifth Army]] in the Serchio valley in front of Lucca to pin Allied units there which might otherwise have been switched to the central front. Two brigades of the 8th Indian Infantry Division were rapidly switched across the Apennines to reinforce the U.S. 92nd Infantry Division. By the time the reinforcements had arrived, the Axis forces had broken through to capture Barga, but decisive action by the 8th Indian Division's [[Major-general (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] [[Dudley Russell]] halted further advance and the situation was stabilised and Barga recaptured by the New Year.<ref>{{cite book | last = Moseley | first = Ray | title = Mussolini : the last 600 days of il Duce | publisher = Taylor Trade Pub | location = Dallas | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-1-58979-095-7 | url = https://archive.org/details/mussolinilast60000mose }} [https://archive.org/details/mussolinilast60000mose/page/156 <!-- quote=Lucca mussolini offensive. --> p. 156]</ref>\n\nIn mid-December Alexander became supreme commander of the [[Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II|Mediterranean Theatre]].
