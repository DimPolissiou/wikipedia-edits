The west end of the building is taken up by two burial aisles (interiors inaccessible), while the [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] Montrose Mausoleum (1736\u201338), now free-standing, but originally forming a \"laird's aisle\", abuts it on the south side.\n\nThe chapel was in use until 1673\n\nThere are a number of 17th and 18th-century gravestones in the churchyard.\n\nThe mausoleum contains [[James Graham, 1st Duke of Montrose]].\n\n==References==\nGifford, J 2007 ''The Buildings of Scotland: Perth and Kinross'', Yale UP, 147\u20138.\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{commons category|Aberuthven}}\n\n{{Perth & Kinross Towns & Villages}}\n\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Villages in Perth and Kinross]]\n\n\n{{PerthKinross-geo-stub}}\n", "name_user": "90.240.67.10", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberuthven"}

At that gathering, Burnett started reminiscing about the old show and making suggestions to Conway of future [[sketch comedy|comedy sketches]] that she wished they could create if the show was still running. Hamilton suggested to Burnett that she do a summer series; Conway immediately agreed.\n\nTaking that idea, Burnett and Hamilton then approached CBS about doing a four-week program in the summer of 1979, but CBS already had their schedule filled for the summer months and rejected the idea.

The guest stars during the four-week period were chronologically [[Cheryl Ladd]], [[Alan Arkin]], [[Penny Marshall]] and [[Sally Field]].  The show also introduced new sketches and characters, including another one of Conway's creations: a preacher named \"Rolly D.

It follows a series of violent murders centered around a [[Los Angeles]] apartment complex, followed by the kidnapping and disappearance of a teenage girl who resides there. The film was marketed as being a dramatization of a true story,<ref name=\"blum\"/> and was briefly banned in the early 1980s in the [[United Kingdom]] during the \"[[video nasty]]\" panic. It has garnered a [[cult following]] in the years since its release, and been cited by horror writer [[Stephen King]] as one of his favorite horror films.\n\n== Plot ==\nA man dressed in black drives through [[Los Angeles]]. Near a car dealership, the man has a [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]] of a car accident that occurred at the site which killed a young woman. The man arrives at an [[apartment]] complex and kills Mrs. Andrews, a female tenant (who recognizes him) with an [[electric drill]]. Afterward, the man dons a [[Balaclava (clothing)|ski mask]] and murders two other women, the first with a hammer and the second with a screwdriver. The police are called and they interview the people who found the bodies, as well as Vance Kingsley, the owner of the building. The next night, the killer strikes again, breaking into the apartment of a woman who is [[masturbating]] in her bathtub and shooting her in the stomach and head with a [[nail gun]]. The murderer then abducts Laurie Ballard, a fifteen-year-old who lives in the above apartment with her family.\n\nLaurie's brother Joey is questioned by Detective Jamison and, frustrated by the detective's seemingly lax attitude towards Laurie's disappearance, decides to search for his sister on his own. While looking through the homes of the murdered women, Joey meets up with Kent, Vance's nephew, who has been hired to clean up the apartments of the deceased tenants. While Joey is helping Kent, Kent mentions that Vance has not been the same since Kathy, (his cousin and Vance's daughter), died in a car accident.\n\nIt is revealed that Vance is the [[serial killer]], having been driven insane and to [[religious delusion|religious mania]] by the death of his daughter. He is killing sinners and has kidnapped Laurie (who is kept tied up and gagged in Kathy's bedroom) to replace Kathy. During a discussion with Detective Jamison, Joey realizes that all the clues point to Vance being the killer, so he goes to the Kingsley house and is followed there by Kent (who had earlier seen the bound and gagged Laurie in his uncle's home). Joey finds bloody tools in Vance's garage, and is confronted by Kent, who sets Joey on fire\u2014burning him to death\u2014to protect his family.\n\nKent walks in on Vance talking to Laurie, and enrages his uncle by telling him that he and Kathy had an incestuous relationship. Vance and Kent fight, and Kent ends up fatally stabbing Vance with a kitchen knife. Kent goes to Laurie, cuts her bonds and rapes her. Afterward, Kent acts as if he and Laurie are married and implies that he killed Joey and Vance, prompting Laurie to stab him to death with a pair of scissors. A dazed and bloodied Laurie wanders out of the house, as an [[intertitle]] states that the film was a dramatization of events that occurred in 1967 and that Laurie was institutionalized for three years and now resides in [[San Fernando Valley]] with her husband and their child.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast list|\n* [[Cameron Mitchell (actor)|Cameron Mitchell]] as Vance Kingsley\n* [[Pamelyn Ferdin]] as Laurie Ballard\n* [[Wesley Eure]] as Kent Kingsley\n* Nicholas Beauvy as Joey Ballard\n* Tim Donnelly as Detective Lieutenant Mark Jamison\n* [[Aneta Corsaut]] as Joanne Ballard\n* Faith McSwain as Mrs. Andrews\n* Marciee Drake as Deborah\n* [[Evelyn Guerrero]] as Maria\n* Victoria Perry as Woman in Apartment\n* Robert Bartlett as Man in Apartment\n* Betty Cole as John's Wife\n* John Hawker as John\n* [[Don Diamond]] as Sergeant Cameron\n* Alisa Powell as Girlfriend\n* [[Kelly Nichols]] as Dee Ann DeVore\n* Robert Forward as Screamer Man\n* [[Kathleen O'Malley]] as Screamer Woman\n* Gil Galvano as Man\n* James Nolan as Al\n* George Deaton as Preacher\n}}\n==Production==\n{{expand section|date=October 2014}}\n\n===Development===\nDevelopment for ''The Toolbox Murders'' began in 1977 when Los Angeles producer Tony Didio a [[Low-budget film|low-budget horror film]] after noticing a successful second release of [[Tobe Hooper]]'s landmark horror film ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]''.<ref name=\"blum\">{{Cite web|last=Burkart|first=Gregory|title=Slashback!

It follows a series of violent murders centered around a [[Los Angeles]] apartment complex, followed by the kidnapping and disappearance of a teenage girl who resides there. The film was marketed as being a dramatization of a true story,<ref name=\"blum\"/> and was briefly banned in the early 1980s in the [[United Kingdom]] during the \"[[video nasty]]\" panic. It has garnered a [[cult following]] in the years since its release, and been cited by horror writer [[Stephen King]] as one of his favorite horror films.\n\n== Plot ==\nA man dressed in black drives through [[Los Angeles]]. Near a car dealership, the man has a [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]] of a car accident that occurred at the site which killed a young woman. The man arrives at an [[apartment]] complex and kills Mrs. Andrews, a female tenant (who recognizes him) with an [[electric drill]]. Afterward, the man dons a [[Balaclava (clothing)|ski mask]] and murders two other women, the first with a hammer and the second with a screwdriver. The police are called and they interview the people who found the bodies, as well as Vance Kingsley, the owner of the building. The next night, the killer strikes again, breaking into the apartment of a woman who is [[masturbating]] in her bathtub and shooting her in the stomach and head with a [[nail gun]]. The murderer then abducts Laurie Ballard, a fifteen-year-old who lives in the above apartment with her family.\n\nLaurie's brother Joey is questioned by Detective Jamison and, frustrated by the detective's seemingly lax attitude towards Laurie's disappearance, decides to search for his sister on his own. While looking through the homes of the murdered women, Joey meets up with Kent, Vance's nephew, who has been hired to clean up the apartments of the deceased tenants. While Joey is helping Kent, Kent mentions that Vance has not been the same since Kathy, (his cousin and Vance's daughter), died in a car accident.\n\nIt is revealed that Vance is the [[serial killer]], having been driven insane and to [[religious delusion|religious mania]] by the death of his daughter. He is killing sinners and has kidnapped Laurie (who is kept tied up and gagged in Kathy's bedroom) to replace Kathy. During a discussion with Detective Jamison, Joey realizes that all the clues point to Vance being the killer, so he goes to the Kingsley house and is followed there by Kent (who had earlier seen the bound and gagged Laurie in his uncle's home). Joey finds bloody tools in Vance's garage, and is confronted by Kent, who sets Joey on fire\u2014burning him to death\u2014to protect his family.\n\nKent walks in on Vance talking to Laurie, and enrages his uncle by telling him that he and Kathy had an incestuous relationship. Vance and Kent fight, and Kent ends up fatally stabbing Vance with a kitchen knife. Kent goes to Laurie, cuts her bonds and rapes her. Afterward, Kent acts as if he and Laurie are married and implies that he killed Joey and Vance, prompting Laurie to stab him to death with a pair of scissors. A dazed and bloodied Laurie wanders out of the house, as an [[intertitle]] states that the film was a dramatization of events that occurred in 1967 and that Laurie was institutionalized for three years and now resides in [[San Fernando Valley]] with her husband and their child.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast list|\n* [[Cameron Mitchell (actor)|Cameron Mitchell]] as Vance Kingsley\n* [[Pamelyn Ferdin]] as Laurie Ballard\n* [[Wesley Eure]] as Kent Kingsley\n* Nicholas Beauvy as Joey Ballard\n* Tim Donnelly as Detective Lieutenant Mark Jamison\n* [[Aneta Corsaut]] as Joanne Ballard\n* Faith McSwain as Mrs. Andrews\n* Marciee Drake as Deborah\n* [[Evelyn Guerrero]] as Maria\n* Victoria Perry as Woman in Apartment\n* Robert Bartlett as Man in Apartment\n* Betty Cole as John's Wife\n* John Hawker as John\n* [[Don Diamond]] as Sergeant Cameron\n* Alisa Powell as Girlfriend\n* [[Kelly Nichols]] as Dee Ann DeVore\n* Robert Forward as Screamer Man\n* [[Kathleen O'Malley]] as Screamer Woman\n* Gil Galvano as Man\n* James Nolan as Al\n* George Deaton as Preacher\n}}\n==Production==\n{{expand section|date=October 2014}}\n\n===Development===\nDevelopment for ''The Toolbox Murders'' began in 1977 when Los Angeles producer Tony Didio a [[Low-budget film|low-budget horror film]] after noticing a successful second release of [[Tobe Hooper]]'s landmark horror film ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]''.<ref name=\"blum\">{{Cite web|last=Burkart|first=Gregory|title=Slashback!

His fitness to qualify for guild membership was judged partly by the masterpiece, and if he was successful, the piece was retained by the guild. Great care was therefore taken to produce a fine piece in whatever the craft was, whether confectionery, painting, [[goldsmith]]ing, [[Knife making|knifemaking]], leatherworking, or many other trades.\n\nIn London, in the 17th century, the [[Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths]], for instance, required an apprentice to produce a masterpiece under their supervision at a \"workhouse\" in [[Goldsmiths' Hall]]. The workhouse had been set up as part of a tightening of standards after the company became concerned that the level of skill of goldsmithing was being diluted. The wardens of the company had complained in 1607 that the \"true practise of the Art & Mystery of Goldsmithry is not only grown into great decays but also dispersed into many parts, so as now very few workmen are able to finish & perfect a piece of plate singularly with all the garnishings & parts thereof without the help of many & several hands...\".

If they failed to be admitted, then they could continue to work for other goldsmiths but not as a master themselves.

Beverly Hills railway station platform building is of aesthetic significance as an austere 1930s railway building with simple Art Deco detailing and fine brick workmanship that is evocative of the effects of the Depression on building programs for large organisations such as the NSW railways. Beverly Hills Railway Station is representative of the cohesive collection of ten East Hills line railway stations from Turrella to East Hills.<ref name=nswshr-1086/>\n\nBeverly Hills railway station was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1086/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nBeverly Hills Railway Station is of historical significance as part of the East Hills line, a major Depression period public work undertaken under the controversial Premiership of Jack Lang, and through its relationship to the development of the suburb of Beverly Hills and the broader East Hills region. The austere design of the platform building is reflective of the completion of the East Hills line as a Depression period unemployment relief works project.<ref name=nswshr-1086/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nBeverly Hills Railway Station platform building is of aesthetic significance as an example of a small Inter-War period suburban railway station platform building matching other East Hills line platform buildings in design and style. The building is very austere in style, with Inter-War Art Deco style touches and is competently executed, exhibiting fine workmanship in its brickwork. The building is noted for its use of monochromatic brickwork, one extant stepped parapet, irregular fenestration and engaged piers.<ref name=nswshr-1086/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nThe place has the potential to contribute to the local community's sense of place, and can provide a connection to the local community's past.<ref name=nswshr-1086/>\n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nBeverly Hills Railway Station is of research significance for its ability to demonstrate design and construction techniques of the Depression period (early 1930s). The building provides insights into NSW Railways experimentation with styles of architecture and adaptation to Depression period economic conditions.<ref name=nswshr-1086/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nThe Beverly Hills Railway Station platform building is not rare, as it is part of a group of ten similar to identical Inter-War suburban railway buildings completed in 1931 between Turrella and East Hills.<ref name=nswshr-1086/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nBeverly Hills Railway Station is a representative example of an East Hills line railway station, with the platform intact and platform building extant but altered, however with modern platform access structures.<ref name=nswshr-1086/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{stack|{{Portal|New South Wales|Railways}}}}\n*[[:Category:Railway stations in Sydney|List of railway stations in Sydney]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Attribution ===\n{{NSW-SHR-CC-contains|name=Beverly Hills Railway Station group|dno=5011930|id=01086|year=2018|accessdate=2 June 2018}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{commons category-inline|Beverly Hills railway station, Sydney|Beverly Hills railway station}}\n*[https://transportnsw.info/stop?q=10101413#/ Beverly Hills station details] Transport for New South Wales\n\n{{Transport for New South Wales railway stations|Airport & South=y|state=collapsed}}\n{{Australian railway bridges|state=autocollapse}}\n\n[[Category:Easy Access railway stations in Sydney]]\n[[Category:Railway stations in Sydney]]\n[[Category:Railway stations opened in 1931]]\n[[Category:New South Wales State Heritage Register]]\n[[Category:Georges River Council]]\n[[Category:Railway bridges in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Articles incorporating text from the New South Wales State Heritage Register]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{Infobox station\n| name = Beverly Hills\n| type = \n| style = Sydney Trains\n| image = BeverlyHillsStation1.JPG\n| image_size = \n| image_caption = View from [[King Georges Road]] in July 2006\n| address = [[King Georges Road]], [[Beverly Hills, New South Wales|Beverly Hills]]\n| country = \n| coordinates = {{coord|-33.948869|151.081430|region:AU-NSW_type:railwaystation|format=dms|display=inline,title}}\n| elevation = \n| distance = {{convert|14.65|km|abbr=on}} from [[Central railway station, Sydney|Central]]\n| line = [[East Hills railway line|East Hills]]\n| other = Bus\n| structure = Ground\n| platform = 2 (1 island)\n| depth = \n| levels = \n| tracks = 4\n| parking = \n| bicycle = \n| opened = 21 December 1931\n| closed = \n| rebuilt = \n| electrified = Yes\n| disabled = Yes\n| code = [[List of New South Wales railway station codes|BVH]]\n| owned = [[RailCorp]]\n| operator = [[Sydney Trains]]\n| status = Staffed\n| former = Dumbleton\n| passengers = 4,750 (daily)<ref>{{cite web |author= Open Data NSW |url=https://opendata.transport.nsw.gov.au/dataset/train-station-entries-and-exits-data}}</ref>\n| pass_year = 2018\n| pass_rank = \n| pass_system = Sydney Trains, NSW TrainLink\n| mpassengers = \n| services = {{s-rail|title=Sydney Trains}}\n{{s-line|system=Sydney Trains|line=T8|previous=Narwee|next=Kingsgrove|}}\n| web = [https://transportnsw.info/stop?q=10101413#/ Transport for NSW]\n| route_map = \n| map_state = \n| embedded = {{Infobox designation list\n|embed = yes\n| designation1 = New South Wales State Heritage Register\n| designation1_offname = Beverly Hills Railway Station group; Dumbleton Railway Station (until 1940)\n| designation1_type = State heritage (complex / group)\n| designation1_date = 2 April 1999\n| delisted1_date = \n| designation1_partof = \n| designation1_number = 1086\n| designation1_free1name =  Type\n| designation1_free1value = Railway Platform / Station\n| designation1_free2name =  Category\n| designation1_free2value = Transport \u2013 Rail\n| designation1_free3name = Builders\n| designation1_free3value = NSW Government Railways\n}}\n}}\n\nThe '''Beverly Hills railway station''' is a [[Heritage register|heritage-listed]] former railway bridge and now [[railway station]] located on the [[East Hills railway line|East Hills line]], serving the [[Sydney]] suburb of [[Beverly Hills, New South Wales|Beverly Hills]] in the [[Georges River Council]] local government area of [[New South Wales]], Australia.

This is one of the least intact of the East Hills line stations (with a similar level of alteration to Padstow).<ref name=nswshr-1086/>\n\n=== Modifications and dates ===\n*1948: line duplicated.\n*1950: Extension to platform building to create a combined booking and parcels office, matching brickwork.\n*{{circa|1960}}s: Span reconstruction to 1931 King Georges Road overbridge.\n*1998: interior fitout alterations to 1931 platform building\n*2004\u20132007: Interior fitout alterations to 1931 platform building. New stairs, canopies and lift.\n*undated: The platform building has been re-roofed in corrugated steel (roofing originally fibro asbestos corrugated sheeting with terracotta ridge capping) and its east end stepped parapet has been demolished. A number of window openings have been bricked up. New timber flush doors. Modern ticket window.<ref name=nswshr-1086/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nAs at 30 November 2010, Beverly Hills Railway Station \u2013 including the 1931 platform and platform building and [[King Georges Road, Sydney|King Georges Road]] overbridge \u2013 has historical significance as a major public work completed as an unemployment relief project during the [[Great Depression in Australia|Great Depression]], and as a major transport hub for the suburb of Beverly Hills since 1931. Beverly Hills railway station platform building is of aesthetic significance as an austere 1930s railway building with simple Art Deco detailing and fine brick workmanship that is evocative of the effects of the Depression on building programs for large organisations such as the NSW railways. Beverly Hills Railway Station is representative of the cohesive collection of ten East Hills line railway stations from Turrella to East Hills.<ref name=nswshr-1086/>\n\nBeverly Hills railway station was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1086/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nBeverly Hills Railway Station is of historical significance as part of the East Hills line, a major Depression period public work undertaken under the controversial Premiership of Jack Lang, and through its relationship to the development of the suburb of Beverly Hills and the broader East Hills region. The austere design of the platform building is reflective of the completion of the East Hills line as a Depression period unemployment relief works project.<ref name=nswshr-1086/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nBeverly Hills Railway Station platform building is of aesthetic significance as an example of a small Inter-War period suburban railway station platform building matching other East Hills line platform buildings in design and style. The building is very austere in style, with Inter-War Art Deco style touches and is competently executed, exhibiting fine workmanship in its brickwork. The building is noted for its use of monochromatic brickwork, one extant stepped parapet, irregular fenestration and engaged piers.<ref name=nswshr-1086/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nThe place has the potential to contribute to the local community's sense of place, and can provide a connection to the local community's past.<ref name=nswshr-1086/>\n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nBeverly Hills Railway Station is of research significance for its ability to demonstrate design and construction techniques of the Depression period (early 1930s). The building provides insights into NSW Railways experimentation with styles of architecture and adaptation to Depression period economic conditions.<ref name=nswshr-1086/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nThe Beverly Hills Railway Station platform building is not rare, as it is part of a group of ten similar to identical Inter-War suburban railway buildings completed in 1931 between Turrella and East Hills.<ref name=nswshr-1086/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nBeverly Hills Railway Station is a representative example of an East Hills line railway station, with the platform intact and platform building extant but altered, however with modern platform access structures.<ref name=nswshr-1086/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{stack|{{Portal|New South Wales|Railways}}}}\n*[[:Category:Railway stations in Sydney|List of railway stations in Sydney]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Attribution ===\n{{NSW-SHR-CC-contains|name=Beverly Hills Railway Station group|dno=5011930|id=01086|year=2018|accessdate=2 June 2018}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{commons category-inline|Beverly Hills railway station, Sydney|Beverly Hills railway station}}\n*[https://transportnsw.info/stop?q=10101413#/ Beverly Hills station details] Transport for New South Wales\n\n{{Transport for New South Wales railway stations|Airport & South=y|state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:Easy Access railway stations in Sydney]]\n[[Category:Railway stations in Sydney]]\n[[Category:Railway stations opened in 1931]]\n[[Category:New South Wales State Heritage Register]]\n[[Category:Georges River Council]]\n[[Category:Railway bridges in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Articles incorporating text from the New South Wales State Heritage Register]]\n", "name_user": "Rangasyd", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:{{Australian railway bridges|state=autocollapse}}", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverly_Hills_railway_station"}

In the 1890s he was a New York socialite, living in the swanky Central Park South neighborhood now in the center of Midtown on the edge of the Theater District. It was there that he kept his [[Salon (gathering)|salon]] and operated his phonograph laboratory.\n\nBettini made a number of high-end phonographs that are highly sought-after today. He invented the Micro-Recorder and Micro-Reproducer, recording and playback devices that improved the sound quality of recordings made on brown wax [[phonograph cylinder]]s, the first commercially practical recording medium.

One of his later inventions was a universal speed indicator, a device that aided the fine speed adjustment of a phonograph motor.\n\nBettini was personally acquainted with many famous musicians and other public figures and he persuaded some of them to make recordings during visits to his New York [[Salon (gathering)|salon]]. He recorded [[Mark Twain]], President [[Benjamin Harrison]] and a number of the outstanding singers and instrumentalists of the 1890s, some of whom made no other recordings. Eventually, Bettini began selling copies of some of his cylinders. His catalog of opera recordings was 12 pages long and the cylinders cost as much as US$6 (equivalent to roughly $150 in early 21st century dollars) at a time when typical commercial cylinder records sold for 50 cents. Some of Bettini's most desirable recordings, such as those of the legendary tenor [[Jean de Reszke]], had been made purely as an experiment and a personal favor to the inventor and were not listed, but the catalog intimated that copies of some unlisted items might be obtained by private arrangement.\n\n1898 was established the French ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Micro-Phonographes Bettini'' with a capital of 850 000 francs in Paris, 23, boulevard des Capucines. \nBefore [[World War I]], Bettini brought his collection of master recordings to France. During [[World War II]], most of them were lost when the warehouse they were stored in was destroyed in an air raid. Due to the combination of that loss, the very small number of copies previously produced, and the fragile and chemically unstable nature of the wax medium, Bettini cylinders are now extremely rare; a few dozen are known to exist. Only the recordings he made of an elderly [[Pope Leo XIII]] just before his death in 1903 (not in 1884, as mistakenly reported in some 2014 news items about papal recordings) were more widely distributed and have consequently survived in multiple copies in both the cylinder and disc formats.\n\nDuring the years 1901 to 1903, New York [[Metropolitan Opera]] librarian Lionel Mapleson used an Edison Phonograph upgraded with a Bettini Micro-Recorder to record hundreds of brief excerpts of live on-stage performances, known as the [[Mapleson Cylinders]].
