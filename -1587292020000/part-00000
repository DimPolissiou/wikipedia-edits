These made use of the high-quality water from the springs and wells in this part of the [[Canongate]].\n\nIn response to the shortage of teachers in Scotland in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Moray House looked to the possibility of building additional teaching facilities close to the existing estate at Holyrood. In 1961 Moray House purchased the property of the Aitchison Brewery. This included buildings at the ends of Playhouse and Old Playhouse Closes as well offices (no. 18 and 19 St John's Street), a tenement (no. 20) and Maltings.

The design of these buildings was representative of 1960s [[Modern architecture|modernist architecture]] and somewhat out of sympathy with the surrounding areas of the [[Old Town, Edinburgh|Old Town]].  The bulk of the buildings were on land formerly occupied by the Edinburgh and Leith Brewery and before that by the Old Edinburgh Playhouse.\n\n===Chessel's Land===\n\n'''Chessel's Land''' was one of three buildings designed by architects Graham and Dey and constructed in the early 1970s; it opened in January 1974.<ref name=\"chessels\"/> It was unused for a number of years and demolished in 2013 to make way for student accommodation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chessel's Land|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/23351536@N07/8683600281/in/album-72157662024296384/|website=flcikr|publisher=flickr|accessdate=14 February 2016}}</ref> Chessel's Land was designed as a specialist centre for the training of teachers in the [[visual art|Visual Arts]], including [[painting]], [[Ceramic art|ceramics]], [[textiles]], [[sculpture]], [[photography]] and [[jewellery]]. Inside the building were sixteen large studios and a large Exhibition Hall, which was available for both student and external use.\n\nIn the original plan for the site, the raised patio in front of Chessel's Land was planned to connect with a proposed Library and a Theatre fronting onto Holyrood Road. These buildings in turn were to be connected with the St Leonard's Land building on the opposite side Holyrood Road. In the event these plans were ruled out by the SED in 1978.  The Theatre was never built and a new Library was eventually developed in Dalhousie Land.\n\nChessel's Land takes its name from [[Archibald Chessel]], a successful wright to trade and stalwart member of the [[Tron Kirk]] who lived in the eighteenth century.  He built the nearby Chessel's Court between 1745 and 1748. These were much-admired mansion flats built to accommodate persons of standing. They are still standing today and remain as private flats.\n\nIn 1993 Chessel's Land became the base for the [[Aesthetic Studies]] Department, when [[Drama]] studios were added. In 1996 [[Music]] was transferred from Old Moray House. With St Mary's Land, Chessel's Land was demolished in 2013 in preparation for construction of new student accommodation.\n\n===Charteris Land===\n'''Charteris Land''' is home to Moray House's departments of Educational Studies and part of the department of Curriculum Research & Development.\n\nIn 1964, draft plans for a ten-storey teaching block were drawn up by the architects, [[William Gordon Dey|Gordon & Dey]], to be built adjacent to the west side of St John Street. However, the [[Royal Fine Art Commission]] raised an objection to the planned height of the building. Consequently, the building of the finally agreed six storeys wasn't started until December 1966. Subsequent delays arising from industrial disputes meant the facility wasn't handed over until February 1969.<ref name=\"charteris\"/>\n\nFollowing advice from the Edinburgh City Archivist this teaching block was named Charteris Land.\n\nThe front of Charteris Land boasts a sculptured wall (and a fourth panel), which were commissioned from David Miller, a member of staff at Moray House. The wall was cast in [[reinforced concrete]] into [[expanded polystyrene]] moulds. The sculpture was created in a continuous twenty-nine-hour operation by Arnott McLeod, Building Contractors.\n\nThe four panels all symbolise an aspect of educational theory:<ref name=\"charteris\"/>\n* Panel 1 '''The Maze''': Based on the use of the maze by [[psychologist]]s such as [[B. F. Skinner|Skinner]] and [[Edward C. Tolman|Tolman]] in experiments on rats to ascertain the power of deduction and memory retention in the learning process.\n* Panel 2 '''Growth and Development''': How a form of life starts with a coincidence of two elements and whose eventual shape is determined by external influences.\n* Panel 3 '''Assimilation of Knowledge''': Where differing units are selected and sorted in a rational way to form an organic retrieval system.\n* Panel 4 '''Community''': With different forms fitting together symbolising the interdependence of man, woman and child.\n\n===Dalhousie Land===\n''Dalhousie Land''' is the [[library]] and [[ICT (education)|ICT]] centre on Holyrood campus. It was again designed by the Edinburgh architects, [[William Gordon Dey|Gordon & Dey]], and was originally constructed in the early 1960s on the site of numbers 2 to 5 St John Street, and originally included a large lecture theatre, Art rooms and a swimming pool.\n\nThis new building was opened on 2 May 1963 by the [[Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]], the Very Reverend Dr Neville Davidson, and was named Dalhousie Land.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Dalhousie Land was refurbished to become the new library for the Holyrood campus. Previously, periodicals, learning resources and books had occupied various rooms over three floors in Paterson's Land.  A grant was obtained in 1994 to enable the relocation of all library facilities to Dalhousie Land.  The refurbishment plans involved the retention of the original concrete container of the swimming pool, which was redesigned to house the [[periodicals]] collection. The current ground floor is at the level of the original edge of the swimming pool, and now houses the main stock area and Service Desk.  A new [[Mezzanine (architecture)|mezzanine]] area was inserted on the south side and housed the Children's Book collection.  The top floor was opened out to house library and computer work stations.  This new Library was opened in August 1996.<ref name=\"dalhousie\">{{cite web | author= Perfect, Hugh | year=2002 | title= Moray House Estates & History - Dalhousie Land | url=http://www.education.ed.ac.uk/aboutus/morayhouse/dalhousieland/index.html| accessdate=2006-11-25 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061011135812/http://www.education.ed.ac.uk/aboutus/morayhouse/dalhousieland/index.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-10-11}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999/2000, a further refurbishment was undertaken to allow for the transfer of the stock from the Cramond campus library before its closure. This involved the creation of a new floor 3 out of the former lecture theatres on floor 2.\n\n===Old Kirk===\nThis building (currently closed) was the kirk of the Old (or Great) Kirk, a congregation which had originally worshiped in part of [[St. Giles' Cathedral]] from 1560, and in this Old Kirk between 1882 and 1941. [[John Knox]] is claimed as the congregation's first minister (1560\u20131572).\n<ref name=\"oldkirk\">{{cite web |author1=Perfect, Hugh  |author2=Starsmeare, David  |lastauthoramp=yes | year=2002 | title= Moray House Estates & History - The Old Kirk | url=http://www.education.ed.ac.uk/aboutus/morayhouse/oldkirk/index.html| accessdate=2006-11-22 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061014014930/http://www.education.ed.ac.uk/aboutus/morayhouse/oldkirk/index.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-10-14}}</ref>\n\nThe building dates from 1881/2. The architects were Anderson and Browne. It stands on the site of the old drying green originally provided by the [[Earl of Wemyss]] to the residents of St John's Street in the 18th century.\n\nIn 1944 Moray House acquired the Old Kirk and its adjacent Hall. Following a major adaptation it became the base for the Music and Educational Handwork departments in 1949. A stage was constructed on the first floor using the timber from discarded desks. The City issued the Governors of Moray House in 1979 with a notice to demolish the Old Kirk's adjacent Hall, which had become dangerous.  Until the merger with the University of Edinburgh in 1998 the building had latterly housed Moray House's Building Services. It closed and is currently a base for construction workers on adjacent sites.\n\n[[File:Moray House, Canongate.jpg|thumb|200px|Old Moray House]]\n\n===Old Moray House===\nOld Moray House is an aristocratic [[mansion]] built after 1618.

This was a prestigious development unusual in Edinburgh at that time consisting as it did of three or four storey tenements each with its own front door. Access to St John's Street from the [[Canongate]] was through a wide pend (1768).\n\nBy the early 1950s Moray House, through the National Committee for the Training of Teachers, owned St John's Land and the tenements along the east side of St John Street. Through the redevelopment of these sites the College was able made its own contribution to the Canongate renewal programme.  The St John's Land project involved the redevelopment of the buildings at 176 - 184 Canongate and No. 1 St John's Street. The architect for the project was [[William Gordon Dey]]. Typical of restoration work at this time no attempt was made to preserve the Georgian interiors. Instead the entire building was gutted and only the existing facades and the south west turret stair were retained. The cost of the works was estimated at \u00a341,000.<ref name=\"stjohn\"/>\n\nOn 24 May 1956 the building was formally opened by [[Walter Elliot (Scottish Unionist MP)|Walter Elliot]], the [[Lord High Commissioner]] for Scotland. [[Clement Attlee|Earl Attlee]], the Prime Minister of the [[Attlee ministry|post-war Labour government]] of 1945 to 1951, was also present. The then College Director of Studies, Dr W B Inglis, gave the votes of thanks.\n\nThe restored building contained studios for the teaching of Speech and Drama, staff studies and seminar rooms and a large proscenium theatre. For many years thereafter St John's Land housed in addition to Drama, the Scottish Centre for Education Overseas (SCEO) and, later, the Department for Social Science and Social Work. The Scottish Association for the Deaf used the basement as a resource and specialist equipment area. The Moray House Theatre was licensed for \"public performances of plays and entertainment\" and could seat an audience of up to 256.\n\nFollowing the merger with the University the interior of the building was refurbished in 1998-99. The architects were Lewis and Hickey DJP. Facilities were created for the Department of Education & Society, including the Centre for Educational Sociology. These works involved the loss of the Moray House Theatre. The last student performance in the theatre, before it was cleared away, was Shakespeare's 'The Tempest'. This has the valedictory line \"And now our Revels all are ended.\"\n\n===St Leonard's Land===\nThe current St Leonard's Land was opened in October 2001, and is the newest building on the Holyrood campus. It houses the [[Physical Education]] and [[Sports science]] departments, and has a [[swimming pool]], [[laboratory]] and [[gym]]nasia. The PE department had originally been sited on a different campus at [[Cramond]] because it did not become part of Moray House until 1987, when Moray House merged with the [[Dunfermline College of Physical Education]]. However the relocation of the Physical Education department from its Cramond campus in July 2001 necessitated the expansion and refurbishment of the existing buildings.<ref name=\"move\"/> The opportunity was taken not only to enlarge St Leonard's Land with a wrap-around academic addition to the north and east sides but to add a six-lane 25-metre research and teaching swimming pool. The architects for this project were FaulknerBrowns.\n\nThe original St Leonard's Land, now the core of the present building, was opened in 1971, and housed the original Moray House Physical Education department, which was a much smaller scale operation than before the merger with Dunfermline college.\n\nThe architects planned the original 1970s building to be unified by a concourse that spanned Holyrood Road, linking St Leonard's Land to a Library and Theatre. These in turn were supposed to connect via an elevated [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] with Chessel's Land and St Mary's Land. In the mid-seventies, these grandiose plans were shelved leaving St Leonard's Land somewhat isolated on the far side of a busy road.<ref name=\"leonards\">{{cite web| author=University of Edinburgh| year=2006| title=St Leonard's Land| url=http://www.ed.ac.uk/buildings/stleonardsland.html| accessdate=2006-11-22| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061207054829/http://www.ed.ac.uk/buildings/stleonardsland.html| archive-date=7 December 2006| url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nSt Leonard's Land takes its name from the neighbourhood of [[St Leonards, Edinburgh|St Leonard's]] which borders [[Holyrood Park]].\n\n===St Mary's Land===\n\nSt Mary's Land was very similar to its adjoining building, Chessels's Land.\nIt housed the Environmental Studies department as well as scientific research.\nSt Mary's Land was demolished in 2013 in preparation for construction of new student accommodation.

These made use of the high-quality water from the springs and wells in this part of the [[Canongate]].\n\nIn response to the shortage of teachers in Scotland in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Moray House looked to the possibility of building additional teaching facilities close to the existing estate at Holyrood. In 1961 Moray House purchased the property of the Aitchison Brewery. This included buildings at the ends of Playhouse and Old Playhouse Closes as well offices (no. 18 and 19 St John's Street), a tenement (no. 20) and Maltings.

The bulk of the buildings were on land formerly occupied by the Edinburgh and Leith Brewery and before that by the Old Edinburgh Playhouse.\n\n===Chessel's Land===\n\n'''Chessel's Land''' was one of three buildings designed by architects Graham and Dey and constructed in the early 1970s; it opened in January 1974.<ref name=\"chessels\"/> It was unused for a number of years and demolished in 2013 to make way for student accommodation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chessel's Land|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/23351536@N07/8683600281/in/album-72157662024296384/|website=flcikr|publisher=flickr|accessdate=14 February 2016}}</ref> Chessel's Land was designed as a specialist centre for the training of teachers in the [[visual art|Visual Arts]], including [[painting]], [[Ceramic art|ceramics]], [[textiles]], [[sculpture]], [[photography]] and [[jewellery]]. Inside the building were sixteen large studios and a large Exhibition Hall, which was available for both student and external use.\n\nIn the original plan for the site, the raised patio in front of Chessel's Land was planned to connect with a proposed Library and a Theatre fronting onto Holyrood Road. These buildings in turn were to be connected with the St Leonard's Land building on the opposite side Holyrood Road. In the event these plans were ruled out by the SED in 1978.  The Theatre was never built and a new Library was eventually developed in Dalhousie Land.\n\nChessel's Land takes its name from [[Archibald Chessel]], a successful wright to trade and stalwart member of the [[Tron Kirk]] who lived in the eighteenth century.  He built the nearby Chessel's Court between 1745 and 1748. These were much-admired mansion flats built to accommodate persons of standing. They are still standing today and remain as private flats.\n\nIn 1993 Chessel's Land became the base for the [[Aesthetic Studies]] Department, when [[Drama]] studios were added. In 1996 [[Music]] was transferred from Old Moray House. With St Mary's Land, Chessel's Land was demolished in 2013 in preparation for construction of new student accommodation.\n\n===Charteris Land===\n'''Charteris Land''' is home to Moray House's departments of Educational Studies and part of the department of Curriculum Research & Development.\n\nIn 1964, draft plans for a ten-storey teaching block were drawn up by the architects, [[William Gordon Dey|Gordon & Dey]], to be built adjacent to the west side of St John Street. However, the [[Royal Fine Art Commission]] raised an objection to the planned height of the building. Consequently, the building of the finally agreed six storeys wasn't started until December 1966. Subsequent delays arising from industrial disputes meant the facility wasn't handed over until February 1969.<ref name=\"charteris\"/>\n\nFollowing advice from the Edinburgh City Archivist this teaching block was named Charteris Land.\n\nThe front of Charteris Land boasts a sculptured wall (and a fourth panel), which were commissioned from David Miller, a member of staff at Moray House. The wall was cast in [[reinforced concrete]] into [[expanded polystyrene]] moulds. The sculpture was created in a continuous twenty-nine-hour operation by Arnott McLeod, Building Contractors.\n\nThe four panels all symbolise an aspect of educational theory:<ref name=\"charteris\"/>\n* Panel 1 '''The Maze''': Based on the use of the maze by [[psychologist]]s such as [[B.

It was again designed by the Edinburgh architects, [[William Gordon Dey|Gordon & Dey]], and was originally constructed in the early 1960s on the site of numbers 2 to 5 St John Street, and originally included a large lecture theatre, Art rooms and a swimming pool.\n\nThis new building was opened on 2 May 1963 by the [[Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]], the Very Reverend Dr Neville Davidson, and was named Dalhousie Land.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Dalhousie Land was refurbished to become the new library for the Holyrood campus. Previously, periodicals, learning resources and books had occupied various rooms over three floors in Paterson's Land.  A grant was obtained in 1994 to enable the relocation of all library facilities to Dalhousie Land.  The refurbishment plans involved the retention of the original concrete container of the swimming pool, which was redesigned to house the [[periodicals]] collection. The current ground floor is at the level of the original edge of the swimming pool, and now houses the main stock area and Service Desk.  A new [[Mezzanine (architecture)|mezzanine]] area was inserted on the south side and housed the Children's Book collection.  The top floor was opened out to house library and computer work stations.  This new Library was opened in August 1996.<ref name=\"dalhousie\">{{cite web | author= Perfect, Hugh | year=2002 | title= Moray House Estates & History - Dalhousie Land | url=http://www.education.ed.ac.uk/aboutus/morayhouse/dalhousieland/index.html| accessdate=2006-11-25 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061011135812/http://www.education.ed.ac.uk/aboutus/morayhouse/dalhousieland/index.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-10-11}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999/2000, a further refurbishment was undertaken to allow for the transfer of the stock from the Cramond campus library before its closure. This involved the creation of a new floor 3 out of the former lecture theatres on floor 2.\n\n===Old Kirk===\nThis building (currently closed) was the kirk of the Old (or Great) Kirk, a congregation which had originally worshiped in part of [[St. Giles' Cathedral]] from 1560, and in this Old Kirk between 1882 and 1941.

The architects were Anderson and Browne. It stands on the site of the old drying green originally provided by the [[Earl of Wemyss]] to the residents of St John's Street in the 18th century.\n\nIn 1944 Moray House acquired the Old Kirk and its adjacent Hall. Following a major adaptation it became the base for the Music and Educational Handwork departments in 1949. A stage was constructed on the first floor using the timber from discarded desks. The City issued the Governors of Moray House in 1979 with a notice to demolish the Old Kirk's adjacent Hall, which had become dangerous.  Until the merger with the University of Edinburgh in 1998 the building had latterly housed Moray House's Building Services. It closed and is currently a base for construction workers on adjacent sites.\n\n[[File:Moray House, Canongate.jpg|thumb|200px|Old Moray House]]\n\n===Old Moray House===\nOld Moray House is an aristocratic [[mansion]] built after 1618.

This was a prestigious development unusual in Edinburgh at that time consisting as it did of three or four storey tenements each with its own front door. Access to St John's Street from the [[Canongate]] was through a wide pend (1768).\n\nBy the early 1950s Moray House, through the National Committee for the Training of Teachers, owned St John's Land and the tenements along the east side of St John Street. Through the redevelopment of these sites the College was able made its own contribution to the Canongate renewal programme.  The St John's Land project involved the redevelopment of the buildings at 176 - 184 Canongate and No. 1 St John's Street. The architect for the project was [[William Gordon Dey]]. Typical of restoration work at this time no attempt was made to preserve the Georgian interiors. Instead the entire building was gutted and only the existing facades and the south west turret stair were retained. The cost of the works was estimated at \u00a341,000.<ref name=\"stjohn\"/>\n\nOn 24 May 1956 the building was formally opened by [[Walter Elliot (Scottish Unionist MP)|Walter Elliot]], the [[Lord High Commissioner]] for Scotland. [[Clement Attlee|Earl Attlee]], the Prime Minister of the [[Attlee ministry|post-war Labour government]] of 1945 to 1951, was also present. The then College Director of Studies, Dr W B Inglis, gave the votes of thanks.\n\nThe restored building contained studios for the teaching of Speech and Drama, staff studies and seminar rooms and a large proscenium theatre. For many years thereafter St John's Land housed in addition to Drama, the Scottish Centre for Education Overseas (SCEO) and, later, the Department for Social Science and Social Work. The Scottish Association for the Deaf used the basement as a resource and specialist equipment area. The Moray House Theatre was licensed for \"public performances of plays and entertainment\" and could seat an audience of up to 256.\n\nFollowing the merger with the University the interior of the building was refurbished in 1998-99. The architects were Lewis and Hickey DJP. Facilities were created for the Department of Education & Society, including the Centre for Educational Sociology. These works involved the loss of the Moray House Theatre. The last student performance in the theatre, before it was cleared away, was Shakespeare's 'The Tempest'. This has the valedictory line \"And now our Revels all are ended.\"\n\n===St Leonard's Land===\nThe current St Leonard's Land was opened in October 2001, and is the newest building on the Holyrood campus. It houses the [[Physical Education]] and [[Sports science]] departments, and has a [[swimming pool]], [[laboratory]] and [[gym]]nasia. The PE department had originally been sited on a different campus at [[Cramond]] because it did not become part of Moray House until 1987, when Moray House merged with the [[Dunfermline College of Physical Education]]. However the relocation of the Physical Education department from its Cramond campus in July 2001 necessitated the expansion and refurbishment of the existing buildings.<ref name=\"move\"/> The opportunity was taken not only to enlarge St Leonard's Land with a wrap-around academic addition to the north and east sides but to add a six-lane 25-metre research and teaching swimming pool. The architects for this project were FaulknerBrowns.\n\nThe original St Leonard's Land, now the core of the present building, was opened in 1971, and housed the original Moray House Physical Education department, which was a much smaller scale operation than before the merger with Dunfermline college.\n\nThe architects planned the original 1970s building to be unified by a concourse that spanned Holyrood Road, linking St Leonard's Land to a Library and Theatre. These in turn were supposed to connect via an elevated [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] with Chessel's Land and St Mary's Land. In the mid-seventies, these grandiose plans were shelved leaving St Leonard's Land somewhat isolated on the far side of a busy road.<ref name=\"leonards\">{{cite web| author=University of Edinburgh| year=2006| title=St Leonard's Land| url=http://www.ed.ac.uk/buildings/stleonardsland.html| accessdate=2006-11-22| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061207054829/http://www.ed.ac.uk/buildings/stleonardsland.html| archive-date=7 December 2006| url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nSt Leonard's Land takes its name from the neighbourhood of [[St Leonards, Edinburgh|St Leonard's]] which borders [[Holyrood Park]].\n\n===St Mary's Land===\n\nSt Mary's Land was very similar to its adjoining building, Chessels's Land.\nIt housed the Environmental Studies department as well as scientific research.\nSt Mary's Land was demolished in 2013 in preparation for construction of new student accommodation. The University Outreach Centre, Levels Cafe, and student accommodation now stand in its place.\n\n===Thomson's Land===\nThomson's Land - contains teaching and tutorial rooms. Originally part of the on-site school which was known as Moray House Demonstration School. The school ran in two levels. The 'A' level was a semi-private school and the 'B' level was utilised as a part of the Teachers Training College enabling trainee teachers to gain classroom experience. The original Old Building contained the Headmaster's study, administration office and science classroom The main classroom areas were in Thomson's Land.

The highest point in the territory is Mont Ross on Kerguelen Island at {{convert|1850|m|ft|abbr=on}}. There are very few airstrips on the islands, only existing on islands with weather stations, and the {{convert|1232|km|abbr=on}} of coastline have no ports or harbors, only offshore anchorages.\n[[File:Kerguelen VolcanDuDiable.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kerguelen Islands]] \u2013 The Volcan du Diable]]\n\nThe islands in the Indian Ocean are supplied by the special ship ''[[Marion Dufresne (1995)|Marion Dufresne]]'' sailing out of [[Le Port, R\u00e9union|Le Port]] in [[R\u00e9union Island]]. Terre Ad\u00e9lie is supplied by ''[[L'Astrolabe (2016 icebreaker)|L'Astrolabe]]'' sailing out of [[Hobart]] in [[Tasmania]].\n\nHowever, the territory has a [[merchant marine]] fleet totaling (in 1999) 2,892,911 [[Gross Register Tonnage|GRT]]/{{DWT|5,165,713|metric|disp=long}}, including seven bulk carriers, five cargo ships, ten chemical tankers, nine container ships, six liquefied gas carriers, 24 petroleum tankers, one refrigerated cargo ship, and ten roll-on-roll-off ([[RORO]]) carriers. This fleet is maintained as a subset of the French register that allows French-owned ships to operate under more liberal taxation and manning regulations than permissible under the main French register.

Economic activity is limited to servicing [[Meteorology|meteorological]] and [[Geophysics|geophysical]] research stations and French and other fishing fleets.\n\nThe main fish resources are [[Patagonian toothfish]] and [[spiny lobster]]. Both are poached by foreign fleets; because of this, the [[French Navy]], and occasionally other services, patrol the zone and arrest poaching vessels. Such arrests can result in heavy fines and/or the seizure of the ship.\n\nFrance previously sold licenses to foreign fisheries to fish the Patagonian toothfish; because of overfishing, it is now restricted to a small number of fisheries from R\u00e9union Island.\n\nThe territory takes in revenues of about [[euro|\u20ac]]16 million a year.\n\n== Codes ==\nThe French Southern Territories (i.e. the TAAF excluding Ad\u00e9lie Land) have been given the following [[country code|country codes]]: FS ([[List of FIPS country codes|FIPS]]) and [[ISO 3166-2:TF|TF]] ([[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]]).\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Geography|Africa|<!--East Africa-->|<!--Indian Ocean-->|France|<!--French Southern and Antarctic Lands-->}}\n\n* [[Administrative divisions of France]]\n* <!-- [[Bibliography of France]] -->\n* [[France]]\n* [[French colonial empire]]\n* <!-- [[Index of France-related articles]] -->\n* [[List of French islands in the Indian and Pacific oceans]]\n* [[List of French possessions and colonies]]\n* [[Outline of France]]\n* [[Overseas France]]\n* <!-- {{wikipedia books link|France}} -->\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|French Southern and Antarctic Lands}}\n{{Wikivoyage}}\n\n* {{wikiatlas|the French Southern and Antarctic Lands}}\n* {{Official website}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130316074522/http://www.france.fr/en/regions-and-cities/french-southern-and-antarctic-lands French Southern and Antarctic Lands] \u2013 Official French website (in English)\n* {{CIA World Factbook link|fs|French Southern and Antarctic Lands}}\n* {{dmoz|Regional/Polar_Regions/Antarctic/French_Southern_Territories|French Southern Territories}}\n* [http://www.discoverfrance.net/Colonies/Antarctic.shtml Southern & Antarctic Territories]\n* [http://www.discoverfrance.net/Colonies/Crozet.shtml Crozet Archipelago]\n* [http://www.discoverfrance.net/Colonies/Kerguelen.shtml Kerguelen Archipelago]\n* [http://www.discoverfrance.net/Colonies/Terre_Adelie.shtml Terre Ad\u00e9lie]\n\n{{Districts of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands}}\n{{World Heritage Sites in France}}\n\n{{Navboxes\n|list = \n{{Peri-Antarctic countries and overseas territories}}\n{{French overseas departments and territories|state=collapsed}}\n{{EU dependencies|state=collapsed}}\n{{Outlying territories of European countries|state=collapsed}}\n{{Antarctica claims|state=collapsed}}\n{{Countries of Africa}}\n}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:French Southern and Antarctic Lands| ]]\n[[Category:Overseas France]]\n[[Category:Island countries of the Indian Ocean]]\n[[Category:Dependent territories in Africa]]\n[[Category:East African countries]]\n[[Category:Southeast African countries]]\n[[Category:France and the Antarctic]]\n[[Category:Territorial claims in Antarctica]]\n[[Category:Geography of Antarctica]]\n[[Category:Geography of Overseas France]]\n[[Category:Special territories of the European Union]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1955]]\n[[Category:1955 establishments in France]]\n[[Category:1955 in Antarctica]]\n[[Category:Ramsar sites in France]]\n[[Category:World Heritage Sites in France]]\n", "name_user": "Kenwick", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Southern_and_Antarctic_Lands"}
