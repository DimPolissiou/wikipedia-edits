Passengers who need service to [[Grand Central\u201342nd Street (New York City Subway)|Grand Central]] are told to use the IRT Flushing Line platforms. An underpass that formerly connected the original [[side platform]]s lies between the downtown local track and the other three tracks of the [[BMT Broadway Line]], which runs perpendicular to the shuttle.\n\nTracks 1 and 3 have gap fillers, as they are concave and curve toward the shuttle trains.

The Board of Transportation operated the [[New York City Transit System]] until the creation of the [[New York City Transit Authority]] in 1953.<ref>{{cite book |first=Clifton |last=Hood |title=722 Miles: The Building of the Subways and How They Transformed New York |year=2004 |edition=Centennial |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=0-8018-8054-8 |pages=238\u2013239}}</ref>\n\nThis station received a minor overhaul in the late 1970s when [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|MTA]] fixed the station's structure and the overall appearance, and it repaired staircases and platform edges, removed pedestrian ramps, and replaced lighting.\n\nIn 2004-2006, the station received a major overhaul and repairs, including upgrading the station for [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA compliance]] and restoring the original late 1910s tiling.

Passengers who need service to [[Grand Central\u201342nd Street (New York City Subway)|Grand Central]] are told to use the IRT Flushing Line platforms. An underpass that formerly connected the original [[side platform]]s lies between the downtown local track and the other three tracks of the [[BMT Broadway Line]], which runs perpendicular to the shuttle.\n\nTracks 1 and 3 have gap fillers, as they are concave and curve toward the shuttle trains.

The change was made at the insistence of Brooklynites who wanted an express station in the theater section of Manhattan. Under the original plan, the express stop would have been located at 47th Street, with a local stop at 42nd. The stop, as an express station, was planned to have connections to the IRT shuttle platforms, the Steinway tunnel line, and the IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1914/02/08/archives/42d-street-an-express-stop-a-big-victory-for-brooklynites-says-the.html |title=42D STREET AN EXPRESS STOP.; A Big Victory for Brooklynites, Says The Brooklyn Eagle. |last=Eagle |first=From The Brooklyn |date=February 8, 1914 |work=The New York Times|access-date=August 1, 2017 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nOn June 1, 1940, the title of the [[Brooklyn\u2013Manhattan Transit Corporation]] was transferred to the [[New York City|City of New York]], signifying the first phase of unification of New York's subway system with the [[Independent Subway System]] as well as eventual public operation of the entire system. (The [[Interborough Rapid Transit Company]] would be merged on June 15 of the same year.) At midnight, a ceremony commemorating the transfer, with five hundred people in attendance, was held at the Times Square station. The last BMT train had left the [[57th Street\u2013Seventh Avenue (BMT Broadway Line)|57th Street]] station five minutes earlier. When the train arrived at Times Square, BMT president William S. Menden handed over his company's properties to Mayor [[Fiorello H. LaGuardia]], who then gave them to [[New York City Board of Transportation]] chairman John H. Delaney. The Board of Transportation operated the [[New York City Transit System]] until the creation of the [[New York City Transit Authority]] in 1953.<ref>{{cite book |first=Clifton |last=Hood |title=722 Miles: The Building of the Subways and How They Transformed New York |year=2004 |edition=Centennial |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=0-8018-8054-8 |pages=238\u2013239}}</ref>\n\nThis station received a minor overhaul in the late 1970s when [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|MTA]] fixed the station's structure and the overall appearance, and it repaired staircases and platform edges, removed pedestrian ramps, and replaced lighting.\n\nIn 2004-2006, the station received a major overhaul and repairs, including upgrading the station for [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA compliance]] and restoring the original late 1910s tiling.

In particular it is concerned with the \"condensed\" phases that appear whenever the number of constituents in a system is extremely large and the interactions between the constituents are strong. The most familiar examples of condensed phases are [[solid]]s and [[liquid]]s, which arise from the [[electromagnetic]] forces between [[atom]]s. Condensed matter physicists seek to understand the behavior of these phases by using [[physical law]]s. In particular, they include the laws of [[quantum mechanics]], [[electromagnetism]] and [[statistical mechanics]].\n\nMore exotic condensed phases include the [[superconductivity|superconducting]] phase exhibited by certain materials at low [[temperature]], the [[ferromagnet]]ic and [[antiferromagnet]]ic phases of [[spin (physics)|spins]] on [[crystal lattice]]s of atoms, and the [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate]] found in [[ultracold atom]]ic systems. The study of condensed matter physics involves measuring various material properties via experimental probes along with using methods of [[theoretical physics]] to develop mathematical models that help in understanding physical behavior.\n\nThe diversity of systems and phenomena available for study makes condensed matter physics the most active field of contemporary physics: one third of all [[People of the United States|American]] physicists self-identify as condensed matter physicists,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.physicstoday.org/jobs/seek/condensed_matter.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090327141400/http://www.physicstoday.org/jobs/seek/condensed_matter.html |archive-date= 2009-03-27 |website=Physics Today Jobs|title= Condensed Matter Physics Jobs: Careers in Condensed Matter Physics| access-date= 2010-11-01}}</ref> and the Division of Condensed Matter Physics is the largest division at the [[American Physical Society]].<ref name=aps-history>{{cite web|title=History of Condensed Matter Physics|url=http://www.aps.org/units/dcmp/history.cfm|publisher=American Physical Society|access-date=27 March 2012}}</ref>  The field overlaps with [[chemistry]], [[materials science]], [[engineering]] and [[nanotechnology]], and relates closely to [[atomic physics]] and [[biophysics]].

Classical phase transition occurs at finite temperature when the order of the system was destroyed.  For example, when ice melts and becomes water, the ordered crystal structure is destroyed.  \n\nIn [[quantum phase transition]]s,  the temperature is set to [[absolute zero]], and the non-thermal control parameter, such as pressure or magnetic field,  causes the phase transitions when order is destroyed by [[quantum fluctuation]]s originating from the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]]. Here, the different quantum phases of the system refer to distinct [[ground state]]s of the [[Hamiltonian matrix]].  Understanding the behavior of quantum phase transition is important in the difficult tasks of explaining the properties of rare-earth magnetic insulators, high-temperature superconductors, and other substances.<ref name=Vojta2003/>\n\nTwo classes of phase transitions occur: ''first-order transitions'' and ''second-order'' or ''continuous transitions''. For the latter, the two phases involved do not co-exist at the transition temperature, also called the [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]].  Near the critical point, systems undergo critical behavior, wherein several of their properties such as [[correlation length]], [[specific heat]], and [[magnetic susceptibility]] diverge exponentially.<ref name=Vojta2003>{{cite journal |last=Vojta |first=Matthias |arxiv= cond-mat/0309604 |title=Quantum phase transitions |year=2003 |doi=10.1088/0034-4885/66/12/R01 |volume=66 |issue=12 |journal=Reports on Progress in Physics |pages=2069\u20132110|bibcode= 2003RPPh...66.2069V |citeseerx=10.1.1.305.3880 }}</ref>  These critical phenomena present serious challenges to physicists because normal [[Macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] laws are no longer valid in the region, and novel ideas and methods must be invented to find the new laws that can describe the system.<ref name=NRC1986>{{cite book |title = Condensed-Matter Physics, Physics Through the 1990s |publisher=National Research Council|year=1986 |url = http://www.nap.edu/catalog/626/an-overview-physics-through-the-1990s |isbn=978-0-309-03577-4 |doi=10.17226/626}}</ref>{{rp|75ff}}\n\nThe simplest theory that can describe continuous phase transitions is the [[Ginzburg\u2013Landau theory]], which works in the so-called [[mean field approximation]].

For other types of systems that involves short range interactions near the critical point, a better theory is needed.<ref name=\"University1989\">{{cite book|author=Malcolm F.

[[Renormalization group]] methods successively average out the shortest wavelength fluctuations in stages while retaining their effects into the next stage.  Thus, the changes of a physical system as viewed at different size scales can be investigated systematically.  The methods, together with powerful computer simulation, contribute greatly to the explanation of the critical phenomena associated with continuous phase transition.<ref name=NRC1986/>{{rp|11}}\n\n==Experimental==\nExperimental condensed matter physics involves the use of experimental probes to try to discover new properties of materials.

Classical phase transition occurs at finite temperature when the order of the system was destroyed.  For example, when ice melts and becomes water, the ordered crystal structure is destroyed.  \n\nIn [[quantum phase transition]]s,  the temperature is set to [[absolute zero]], and the non-thermal control parameter, such as pressure or magnetic field,  causes the phase transitions when order is destroyed by [[quantum fluctuation]]s originating from the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]]. Here, the different quantum phases of the system refer to distinct [[ground state]]s of the [[Hamiltonian matrix]].  Understanding the behavior of quantum phase transition is important in the difficult tasks of explaining the properties of rare-earth magnetic insulators, high-temperature superconductors, and other substances.<ref name=Vojta2003/>\n\nTwo classes of phase transitions occur: ''first-order transitions'' and ''second-order'' or ''continuous transitions''. For the latter, the two phases involved do not co-exist at the transition temperature, also called the [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]].  Near the critical point, systems undergo critical behavior, wherein several of their properties such as [[correlation length]], [[specific heat]], and [[magnetic susceptibility]] diverge exponentially.<ref name=Vojta2003>{{cite journal |last=Vojta |first=Matthias |arxiv= cond-mat/0309604 |title=Quantum phase transitions |year=2003 |doi=10.1088/0034-4885/66/12/R01 |volume=66 |issue=12 |journal=Reports on Progress in Physics |pages=2069\u20132110|bibcode= 2003RPPh...66.2069V |citeseerx=10.1.1.305.3880 }}</ref>  These critical phenomena present serious challenges to physicists because normal [[Macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] laws are no longer valid in the region, and novel ideas and methods must be invented to find the new laws that can describe the system.<ref name=NRC1986>{{cite book |title = Condensed-Matter Physics, Physics Through the 1990s |publisher=National Research Council|year=1986 |url = http://www.nap.edu/catalog/626/an-overview-physics-through-the-1990s |isbn=978-0-309-03577-4 |doi=10.17226/626}}</ref>{{rp|75ff}}\n\nThe simplest theory that can describe continuous phase transitions is the [[Ginzburg\u2013Landau theory]], which works in the so-called [[mean field approximation]].

However, it resulted in a disappointing loss to the underdog [[New York Jets]] in overtime in [[2004\u201305 NFL playoffs|2005]].\n\nDuring the [[2005 NFL Draft]], the Chargers tried to get some key rookies that would help carry the momentum from their mostly successful 2004\u201305 run.  They used their first pick on LB [[Shawne Merriman|Shawne \"Lights Out\" Merriman]] from the University of Maryland.  Then, they used their next pick on DT [[Luis Castillo (football player)|Luis Castillo]] from Northwestern University.  Their other choices were WR [[Vincent Jackson]] from Northern Colorado, RB [[Darren Sproles]] from Kansas State, OT [[Wesley Britt]] from University of Alabama, OT [[Wes Sims (American football)|Wes Sims]] from Oklahoma University, and Center [[Scott Mruczkowski]] from Bowling Green State.\n\nThe Chargers got off to a rough start in their 2005 campaign, losing a close one to the [[Dallas Cowboys]] in their Week 1 home-opener (28\u201324) and then they lost on the road to their AFC West rival, the [[Denver Broncos]] (20\u201317).  It wasn't until a Week 3 home game on Sunday night that they got their first win of the season, when [[Eli Manning]] and the [[New York Giants]] got \"shocked to the system\" as [[LaDainian Tomlinson]] had one of the greatest games of his career.  He got 220 total yards, had 3 rushing touchdowns, and threw for a touchdown as he helped the Chargers win 45\u201323.\n\nA week later, they were able to build off their win by not only beating the two-time defending champion [[New England Patriots]] 41\u201317, but also ending the Pats' 21-game winning streak at home. In their Week 5 Monday Night home game against the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], the Chargers wore their throw-back uniforms during this season (they had also worn them during the 1994 season). The Steelers held on to win with a 40-yard field goal by [[Jeff Reed (football player)|Jeff Reed]] (24\u201322). The Chargers rebounded on the road against their division rival [[Oakland Raiders]] (27\u201314). In their Week 7 road trip to Philadelphia, they hoped to build off their win against the Eagles. Late in the game, with the Chargers leading 17\u201313, the Chargers tried to go for a field goal to put their lead well out of reach, but it got blocked and Eagles DB [[Matt Ware]] returned it 65 yards for the game-winning touchdown and the Chargers fourth loss of the season.\n\nAfter going 3\u20134, the Chargers turned things around as they began a five-game winning streak. They won at home against division-rival [[Kansas City Chiefs]] (28\u201320) and on the road against the [[New York Jets]] (31\u201326). Coming off their Week 10 bye, they went home and wore their throw-back uniforms again. This time, it was a dominating performance as the Chargers man-handled the [[Buffalo Bills]], 48\u201310. Then, they went on the road and won a close match against the [[Washington Redskins]] (23\u201317 in OT) and then they swept the Oakland Raiders at home by a score of 34\u201310.\n\nThe Chargers were 8\u20135, coming off a 23\u201321 loss to the [[Miami Dolphins]]. On December 18, the Chargers beat the undefeated [[Indianapolis Colts]] 26\u201317, snapping a 13\u20130 winning streak. However, despite a record of 9\u20136, they were officially eliminated from AFC playoff contention in 2005 after a 20\u20137 loss to the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] the following Saturday. The Chargers lost their final game of the season by a score of 23\u20137 to the AFC West champion Denver Broncos to finish with a record of 9\u20137.\n\n===2006\u20132009===\n[[File:Philip_Rivers_2014.JPG|right|upright|thumbnail|Philip Rivers has started every game at quarterback since [[2006 San Diego Chargers season|2006]].]]\nThe Chargers delivered an impressive performance in [[2006 San Diego Chargers season|2006]], losing only to the Ravens and Chiefs; they finished 14\u20132 which secured them the #1 AFC seed in the playoffs. However, they lost 24-21 to the [[New England Patriots]] in the divisional round. Following the 2006 season, they replaced Schottenheimer with new head coach [[Norv Turner]]. In [[2007 San Diego Chargers season|2007]], they went 11-5, beating the [[Tennessee Titans]] and the defending champion [[Indianapolis Colts]] to reach the AFC title game. However, they fell to the Patriots for the second year in a row. In [[2008 San Diego Chargers season|2008]], the Chargers dropped to 8\u20138, but as the [[AFC West]] was unusually weak that year, they still managed to win the division title. Defeating the Colts in the wild card round, they lost to the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] in the divisional round.\n\nSan Diego began the [[2009 San Diego Chargers season|2009 season]] 2\u20133. After losing to the Broncos on Monday night, they began an unbroken winning streak for the rest of the season, which included defeating the entire [[NFC East]]. In Week 11, they avenged their earlier loss against the Broncos by inflicting a 32\u20133 rout on them. The next game saw them beat a 1\u201311 [[Cleveland Browns]] squad 30-23, in which [[LaDainian Tomlinson]] broke Hall of Famer [[Jim Brown]]'s rushing record and was congratulated by him afterwards. The Chargers secured another division title, the #2 AFC seed, and looked to be a near shoo-in for the [[Super Bowl]]. However, the team's postseason futility continued. Hosting the [[New York Jets]] on January 17, 2010, they endured an upset defeat, where, despite an early lead, were unable to overcome the strong Jets' defense. Kicker [[Nate Kaeding]] also missed three field goal and PAT attempts, which resulted in the Chargers losing 17\u201314.\n\n===2010\u20132012: End of the Norv Turner/A.J. Smith era===\n\nThe [[2010 San Diego Chargers season|2010 season]] was the 1st season without [[LaDainian Tomlinson]] since 2000 (Tomlinson was let go by management due to an oversized contract relative to production and other issues; he went on to lead the [[New York Jets|Jets]] in rushing with 914 yards & tied for 3rd in receptions with 52).  The 2010 campaign started off slowly again, this time 2\u20135 (including losses to some of the worst teams in football at the time \u2013 the [[2010 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]], the [[2010 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]], the [[2010 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]] and the [[2010 St. Louis Rams season|St. Louis Rams]]).  The losses were due to turnovers & mental mistakes by young players on special teams allowing blocked punts & kick/punt return touchdowns.

From that point on, however, the Chargers began a six-game skid with losses to the [[New York Jets|Jets]], [[Kansas City Chiefs|Chiefs]], [[Green Bay Packers|Packers]], [[Oakland Raiders|Raiders]], [[Chicago Bears|Bears]], and [[Denver Broncos|Broncos]], with the first four by only a score and against Denver in overtime. Injuries to both the offensive and the defensive line hit the Chargers hard. But finally on December 5, 2011, the Chargers got their first win in over a month against the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]], beating the also-struggling team. \nThe Chargers then began a three-game winning streak most notably beating the Ravens by more than any team has beat them that season.\nHowever, the Chargers were beaten, 38\u201310, by the [[Detroit Lions]] to drop their record to 7\u20138 and eliminate the possibility of being in the playoffs. After a 38\u201326 victory over the Raiders in week 17, the Chargers finished at 8\u20138 and in a numerical tie for first place in the AFC West along with Oakland and Denver. However, the Chargers were beaten out by Denver for the Division Title via tie-breaker.

The Chargers then lost to the [[2013 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] at [[Sports Authority Field at Mile High]] the following Sunday, January 12, 2014 (24-17).\n\nAfter starting the season strongly, including a five-win run in September and October, the Chargers were beset by a string of injuries to key players, and eventually finished the season at 9-7. In contrast to 2013, the record was not enough to make the playoffs. The Chargers began the season 5\u20131, winning five straight after losing their season opener. It was followed by a three-game losing streak, and they finished 4\u20134 in the second half. They won just two of their final five games, coming back from double-digit fourth quarter deficits twice to remain in playoff contention. They lost the final game of the season when a win would have secured a playoff berth. In three of their last four games, and five of their last eight, the Chargers did not score more than one touchdown. Compared to 2013, the offense dropped in points (from 12th in the league to 17th), yards (5th to 18th), first downs (3rd to 15th), net yards per pass (2nd to 8th), rushing yards (13th to 30) and yards per rush (21st to 31st). It was the second time in three years the team finished second-to-last in yards per carry. San Diego was just 2\u20134 against teams in their division in the AFC West, and were swept by both the Denver Broncos and the Kansas City Chiefs. It was their worst intradivision record since they were 1\u20135 in 2003. The Chargers were only 3\u20136 against teams with winning records. They matched their 9\u20137 record from 2013, but missed the playoffs for the fourth time in five seasons.\n\nDuring the season, the Chargers, the [[St. Louis Rams]], and the [[Oakland Raiders]] all intimated they might apply for relocation to Los Angeles at the end of the season.

During its period in the AFL, the club also used a shield logo that featured a horsehead, a lightning bolt, and the word \"Chargers\". The team brought the logo back for on-field design in the 2018 season.\n\nFrom 1960 to 1973, the colors consisted of various shades of Electric blue (\"powder\" blue, but technically called Collegiate blue){{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} or white jerseys, both with gold lightning bolts on the shoulders. The helmets were white and had both the arc-shaped lightning bolt logo, in gold or navy depending on the year, and the player's number. At first, the team wore white pants before switching to gold in 1966. In 1973, the numerals on the blue jerseys changed from white to gold.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}\n\nIn [[1974 San Diego Chargers season|1974]], the sky blue was changed to dark royal blue. The helmet was also changed to dark blue and the players' numbers were removed. Additionally, the face masks became yellow, thus making them one of the first teams in the NFL (with the Kansas City Chiefs) to use a facemask color other than the then-predominant grey. From [[1978 San Diego Chargers season|1978]] through [[1983 San Diego Chargers season|1983]], the Chargers wore their white jerseys at home, coinciding with the hiring of coach Don Coryell&nbsp;\u2013 when [[Joe Gibbs]], a Coryell assistant in 1979\u201380, became head coach of the [[Washington Redskins]] in 1981, he did the same, and white at home became a Redskins staple through 2007 \u2013 but Coryell switched the Chargers to their blue jerseys at home starting in [[1984 San Diego Chargers season|1984]]. With the exception of the [[1991 San Diego Chargers season|1991 season]] and other sporadic home games since, San Diego wears its blue jerseys at home.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}\n\nIn [[1985 San Diego Chargers season|1985]], the Chargers started using navy blue jerseys and returned to wearing white pants. The team's uniform design was next revamped in 1988. It featured an even darker shade of navy blue. The lightning bolts on the jerseys and helmets were white, with navy interior trim and gold outlining; the facemasks became navy blue. In [[1990 San Diego Chargers season|1990]], the team started to wear navy pants with their white jerseys. From [[1988 San Diego Chargers season|1988]] to [[1991 San Diego Chargers season|1991]], the team displayed stripes down the pants rather than lightning bolts. The Chargers went with all-white combinations in [[1997 San Diego Chargers season|1997]] and [[2001 San Diego Chargers season|2001]], only to have the blue pants make a comeback. On October 27, 2003, the Chargers wore their navy pants with their navy jersey for a ''Monday Night Football'' game versus the [[Miami Dolphins]] that was played at [[Sun Devil Stadium]], then the home of the [[Arizona Cardinals]], due to wildfires in southern California. This remains the only game in which the Chargers have worn the all-dark combination.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}|\n\nFrom the late 1980s to 2000, the Chargers wore white at home during some preseason games and dark for regular season games. In [[2001 San Diego Chargers season|2001]], the Chargers started wearing their dark uniforms for preseason games and white uniforms in September home games due to the heat before switching back to dark in October.\n\nIn March 2007, the Chargers unveiled their first uniform redesign since 1988, on the team's official website. The team formally unveiled this new uniform set, which mixes old and new styles, in a private team-only event. Navy blue remains the primary color on the home jersey, but the familiar lightning bolt was reverted to gold, and now has navy outlining and powder blue interior trim. The latter color is a nod to the 1960s uniforms. The redesigned lightning bolt was moved to the sides of the shoulders from the top, and includes a new numbering font and word mark in white, with gold outlining and powder blue interior trim. The pants also have a redesigned lightning bolt in gold, with powder blue trim on a navy stripe. Additionally, the team pays tribute to other uniform features from their history by wearing a metallic white helmet, with a navy face mask, the newly revamped bolt in gold with navy and powder blue trim, and white pants. The road white jerseys with navy pants, as well as the alternate powder blue jerseys with white pants, were also redesigned with the new scheme.<ref>{{cite news|title=Chargers Unveil New Uniforms|url=http://www.chargers.com/news/2007/03/14/chargers-unveil-new-uniforms|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=Chargers.com|date=March 14, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160811143337/https://www.chargers.com/news/2007/03/14/chargers-unveil-new-uniforms|archive-date=August 11, 2016|access-date=June 10, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nFrom [[2002 San Diego Chargers season|2002]] to [[2006 San Diego Chargers season|2006]], the Chargers used the early-1960s powder blue uniforms as alternate jerseys, which many football fans (both of the Chargers and of other teams) clamored for the team to bring back full-time.\n\nSince [[2007 San Diego Chargers season|2007]], the Chargers have worn the alternate powder blue jerseys twice per season.

There are few recognized guidelines in sports regarding retiring numbers, and the NFL has no specific league policy.  \"You have to have enough numbers for players to wear\", said NFL spokesman Greg Aiello.<ref name=\"sullivan_03042010\">{{cite news|last=Sullivan |first=Tim |title=Retiring a number can be tricky math problem |date=March 4, 2010 |newspaper=The San Diego Union Tribune |url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2010/mar/04/retiring-number-tricky-math-sullivan/?print&page=all |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20121209005200/http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2010/mar/04/retiring-number-tricky-math-sullivan/?print&page=all |archivedate=December 9, 2012 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> The Chargers have rarely retired numbers.<ref name=\"schofield\">{{cite news|last=Scholfield|first=Steve|title=Chargers to honor AFL icon Alworth|date=July 14, 2005|newspaper=North County Times|url=http://www.nctimes.com/sports/columnists/scholfield/article_f4af5516-4838-5fc0-b49e-5c50de637f2f.html|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130104014613/http://www.nctimes.com/sports/columnists/scholfield/article_f4af5516-4838-5fc0-b49e-5c50de637f2f.html|url-status=dead|archivedate=January 4, 2013}}</ref> The ''[[San Diego Union-Tribune]]'' wrote, \"The [Chargers] tend to honor their heritage haphazardly.\"<ref name=\"sullivan_08152006\">{{cite news|last=Sullivan|first=Tim|title=This time, icon finally receives proper sendoff|date=August 15, 2006|newspaper=The San Diego Union-Tribune|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060815/news_1s15sullivan.html|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130202061617/http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060815/news_1s15sullivan.html|url-status=dead|archivedate=February 2, 2013}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers}};\"|'''Los Angeles Chargers retired numbers'''\n|-\n!

Packer replaced legendary P.A. announcer Bruce Binkowski, who went on to become the executive director of the Holiday and Poinsettia Bowl games, which are played at their former home, [[SDCCU Stadium]].\n\nWith the Chargers' return to Los Angeles in 2017, the team became a beneficiary of league scheduling policies. Both the Chargers and the [[Los Angeles Rams]] share the Los Angeles market, which is on the West Coast of the United States. This means that the Chargers cannot play home games, road division games against the [[Denver Broncos]] or [[Las Vegas Raiders]], or interconference road games against the [[NFC West]] (in seasons that the [[AFC West]] and NFC West meet in interconference play) in the early 10:00&nbsp;a.m. [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific time]] slot. In addition, they cannot play interconference home games at the same time or network as the Rams. As a result, both teams generally will have more limited scheduling options, and will also benefit by receiving more prime-time games than usual ([[National Football League on television#Chargers and Rams|click here]] for further information). Thus, regardless of the previous season's record, the Chargers will receive a disproportionate number of ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night]]'', ''[[Monday Night Football|Monday Night]]'' and/or ''[[Thursday Night Football|Thursday Night]]'' games, compared to the rest of the league. Additionally, if the Chargers and Rams are both playing at the same time on Sunday afternoons on a certain network (for instance, a Rams road game against an AFC opponent at the same time as a Charger home game with an NFC opponent with both on Fox, or the reverse where the Rams are on the road against an AFC opponent and the Chargers are at home against an AFC opponent on CBS), in the Los Angeles market, Fox and CBS have authorization to carry the extra game on their secondary sister stations; Fox games air on [[KCOP-TV]], while CBS games are aired on [[KCAL-TV]]. In 2020, the Chargers signed a multi-year preseason TV deal with [[KCBS-TV]] and [[KCAL-TV]] and will have a weekly show with the latest team news, replacing [[KABC-TV]] after three seasons (2017, 2018 and 2019) of televising Chargers preseason football. \n\n===Radio affiliates===\n[[File: San Diego Chargers radio affiliates.png|thumb|Map of radio affiliates]]\n[https://www.chargers.com/news/chargers-radio-network Chargers Radio Network]\n[http://www.chargers.com/news/2017/07/28/chargers-finalize-2017-broadcast-team-and-station-affiliates Chargers Finalize 2017 Broadcast Team and Station Affiliates]\n\n===English stations===\n\n====California====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers|border=2}};\" | City !! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers|border=2}};\" | Call Sign !! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers|border=2}};\" | Frequency\n|-\n| rowspan=5|Los Angeles || [[KFI]] || 640 AM (Previous affiliate from 2017-2020)\n|-\n| [[KOST]] || 103.5 HD2 (HD radio simulcast of [[KFI]], Previous affiliate from 2017-2020)\n|-\n| [[KYSR]]/[[KSRY]] || 98.7/103.1 FM (Pre-Game [first two-hours], Full Game Coverage and 'Chargers Talk' Post-Game)\n|-\n| [[KYSR]] || 98.7 HD2 (HD radio simulcast of [[KLAC]], will carry select games)\n|-\n| [[KLAC]] || 570 AM (Secondary affiliate to [[KYSR]], will carry select games)\n|-\n| rowspan=2|[[San Diego]] || [[KGB-FM]] || 101.5 FM\n|-\n| [[KLSD]] || 1360 AM\n|-\n| [[Temecula, California|Temecula]]/[[Inland Empire]] || [[KATY-FM]] || 101.3 FM\n|-\n| [[Yucca Valley, California|Yucca Valley]] || [[KNWH]] || 1250 AM\n|-\n| [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]] || [[KNWZ]] || 94.3 FM\n|-\n| [[Palmdale, California|Palmdale]]/[[Lancaster, California|Lancaster]] || [[KAVL]] || 610 AM\n|-\n| [[Victorville, California|Victorville]]/[[Hesperia, California|Hesperia]] || [[KMPS (AM)|KMPS]] || 910 AM\n|-\n| [[Imperial Valley]] || [[KXO-FM]] || 107.5 FM \n|}\n\n====Nevada====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers|border=2}};\" | City !! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers|border=2}};\" | Call Sign !! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers|border=2}};\" | Frequency\n|-\n| [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] || [[KKGK]] || 1340 AM\n|}\n\n===Spanish stations===\n\n====California====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers|border=2}};\" | City !! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers|border=2}};\" | Call Sign !! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers|border=2}};\" | Frequency\n|-\n| Los Angeles/[[Orange County, California|Orange County]] || [[KFWB]] || 980 AM\n|-\n| [[San Diego]]/[[Tijuana|Tijuana, Mexico]] || [[XEXX-AM]] || 1420 AM\n|}\n\n====Mexico====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers|border=2}};\" | City !! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers|border=2}};\" | Call Sign !! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers|border=2}};\" | Frequency\n|-\n|-\n| [[Mexicali, Mexico|Mexicali]] || [[XEHG-AM|XEHG]] || 1370 AM\n|-\n| [[Ensenada, Mexico|Ensenada]] || [[XHEPF-FM]] || 89.1 FM\n|}\n\n==Theme song==\n{{Main|San Diego Super Chargers}}\n\nThe Chargers' [[fight song]], \"[[San Diego Super Chargers]]\", was recorded in 1979 at the height of the team's success with [[Coryell offense|Air Coryell]], and has a distinctly [[disco]] sound.

However, it resulted in a disappointing loss to the underdog [[New York Jets]] in overtime in [[2004\u201305 NFL playoffs|2005]].\n\nDuring the [[2005 NFL Draft]], the Chargers tried to get some key rookies that would help carry the momentum from their mostly successful 2004\u201305 run.  They used their first pick on LB [[Shawne Merriman|Shawne \"Lights Out\" Merriman]] from the University of Maryland.  Then, they used their next pick on DT [[Luis Castillo (football player)|Luis Castillo]] from Northwestern University.  Their other choices were WR [[Vincent Jackson]] from Northern Colorado, RB [[Darren Sproles]] from Kansas State, OT [[Wesley Britt]] from University of Alabama, OT [[Wes Sims (American football)|Wes Sims]] from Oklahoma University, and Center [[Scott Mruczkowski]] from Bowling Green State.\n\nThe Chargers got off to a rough start in their 2005 campaign, losing a close one to the [[Dallas Cowboys]] in their Week 1 home-opener (28\u201324) and then they lost on the road to their AFC West rival, the [[Denver Broncos]] (20\u201317).  It wasn't until a Week 3 home game on Sunday night that they got their first win of the season, when [[Eli Manning]] and the [[New York Giants]] got \"shocked to the system\" as [[LaDainian Tomlinson]] had one of the greatest games of his career.  He got 220 total yards, had 3 rushing touchdowns, and threw for a touchdown as he helped the Chargers win 45\u201323.\n\nA week later, they were able to build off their win by not only beating the two-time defending champion [[New England Patriots]] 41\u201317, but also ending the Pats' 21-game winning streak at home. In their Week 5 Monday Night home game against the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], the Chargers wore their throw-back uniforms during this season (they had also worn them during the 1994 season). The Steelers held on to win with a 40-yard field goal by [[Jeff Reed (football player)|Jeff Reed]] (24\u201322). The Chargers rebounded on the road against their division rival [[Oakland Raiders]] (27\u201314). In their Week 7 road trip to Philadelphia, they hoped to build off their win against the Eagles. Late in the game, with the Chargers leading 17\u201313, the Chargers tried to go for a field goal to put their lead well out of reach, but it got blocked and Eagles DB [[Matt Ware]] returned it 65 yards for the game-winning touchdown and the Chargers fourth loss of the season.\n\nAfter going 3\u20134, the Chargers turned things around as they began a five-game winning streak. They won at home against division-rival [[Kansas City Chiefs]] (28\u201320) and on the road against the [[New York Jets]] (31\u201326). Coming off their Week 10 bye, they went home and wore their throw-back uniforms again. This time, it was a dominating performance as the Chargers man-handled the [[Buffalo Bills]], 48\u201310. Then, they went on the road and won a close match against the [[Washington Redskins]] (23\u201317 in OT) and then they swept the Oakland Raiders at home by a score of 34\u201310.\n\nThe Chargers were 8\u20135, coming off a 23\u201321 loss to the [[Miami Dolphins]]. On December 18, the Chargers beat the undefeated [[Indianapolis Colts]] 26\u201317, snapping a 13\u20130 winning streak. However, despite a record of 9\u20136, they were officially eliminated from AFC playoff contention in 2005 after a 20\u20137 loss to the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] the following Saturday. The Chargers lost their final game of the season by a score of 23\u20137 to the AFC West champion Denver Broncos to finish with a record of 9\u20137.\n\n===2006\u20132009===\n[[File:Philip_Rivers_2014.JPG|right|upright|thumbnail|Philip Rivers has started every game at quarterback since [[2006 San Diego Chargers season|2006]].]]\nThe Chargers delivered an impressive performance in [[2006 San Diego Chargers season|2006]], losing only to the Ravens and Chiefs; they finished 14\u20132 which secured them the #1 AFC seed in the playoffs. However, they lost 24-21 to the [[New England Patriots]] in the divisional round. Following the 2006 season, they replaced Schottenheimer with new head coach [[Norv Turner]]. In [[2007 San Diego Chargers season|2007]], they went 11-5, beating the [[Tennessee Titans]] and the defending champion [[Indianapolis Colts]] to reach the AFC title game. However, they fell to the Patriots for the second year in a row. In [[2008 San Diego Chargers season|2008]], the Chargers dropped to 8\u20138, but as the [[AFC West]] was unusually weak that year, they still managed to win the division title. Defeating the Colts in the wild card round, they lost to the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] in the divisional round.\n\nSan Diego began the [[2009 San Diego Chargers season|2009 season]] 2\u20133. After losing to the Broncos on Monday night, they began an unbroken winning streak for the rest of the season, which included defeating the entire [[NFC East]]. In Week 11, they avenged their earlier loss against the Broncos by inflicting a 32\u20133 rout on them. The next game saw them beat a 1\u201311 [[Cleveland Browns]] squad 30-23, in which [[LaDainian Tomlinson]] broke Hall of Famer [[Jim Brown]]'s rushing record and was congratulated by him afterwards. The Chargers secured another division title, the #2 AFC seed, and looked to be a near shoo-in for the [[Super Bowl]]. However, the team's postseason futility continued. Hosting the [[New York Jets]] on January 17, 2010, they endured an upset defeat, where, despite an early lead, were unable to overcome the strong Jets' defense. Kicker [[Nate Kaeding]] also missed three field goal and PAT attempts, which resulted in the Chargers losing 17\u201314.\n\n===2010\u20132012: End of the Norv Turner/A.J.

From that point on, however, the Chargers began a six-game skid with losses to the [[New York Jets|Jets]], [[Kansas City Chiefs|Chiefs]], [[Green Bay Packers|Packers]], [[Oakland Raiders|Raiders]], [[Chicago Bears|Bears]], and [[Denver Broncos|Broncos]], with the first four by only a score and against Denver in overtime. Injuries to both the offensive and the defensive line hit the Chargers hard. But finally on December 5, 2011, the Chargers got their first win in over a month against the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]], beating the also-struggling team. \nThe Chargers then began a three-game winning streak most notably beating the Ravens by more than any team has beat them that season.\nHowever, the Chargers were beaten, 38\u201310, by the [[Detroit Lions]] to drop their record to 7\u20138 and eliminate the possibility of being in the playoffs.

The Chargers then lost to the [[2013 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] at [[Sports Authority Field at Mile High]] the following Sunday, January 12, 2014 (24-17).\n\nAfter starting the season strongly, including a five-win run in September and October, the Chargers were beset by a string of injuries to key players, and eventually finished the season at 9-7. In contrast to 2013, the record was not enough to make the playoffs. The Chargers began the season 5\u20131, winning five straight after losing their season opener. It was followed by a three-game losing streak, and they finished 4\u20134 in the second half. They won just two of their final five games, coming back from double-digit fourth quarter deficits twice to remain in playoff contention. They lost the final game of the season when a win would have secured a playoff berth. In three of their last four games, and five of their last eight, the Chargers did not score more than one touchdown. Compared to 2013, the offense dropped in points (from 12th in the league to 17th), yards (5th to 18th), first downs (3rd to 15th), net yards per pass (2nd to 8th), rushing yards (13th to 30) and yards per rush (21st to 31st). It was the second time in three years the team finished second-to-last in yards per carry. San Diego was just 2\u20134 against teams in their division in the AFC West, and were swept by both the Denver Broncos and the Kansas City Chiefs. It was their worst intradivision record since they were 1\u20135 in 2003. The Chargers were only 3\u20136 against teams with winning records. They matched their 9\u20137 record from 2013, but missed the playoffs for the fourth time in five seasons.\n\nDuring the season, the Chargers, the [[St. Louis Rams]], and the [[Oakland Raiders]] all intimated they might apply for relocation to Los Angeles at the end of the season. The Chargers announced in December 2014 that they would not be seeking to relocate for the 2015 season, followed by an announcement from the NFL that no team would relocate to L.A. until the 2016 season at the earliest.<ref>{{cite news|last=Florio|first=Mike|title=2016 becomes the target for an L.A. move|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2014/12/20/2016-becomes-the-target-for-an-l-a-move/|work=ProFootballTalk|date=December 20, 2014|accessdate=January 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\nControversy filled the 2015 offseason, as attorney and team spokesperson Mark Fabiani continually bashed the local San Diego city government's efforts to negotiate a replacement for Qualcomm Stadium.

The Chargers lost to the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] and [[Minnesota Vikings]] on the road before defeating the [[Cleveland Browns]] on a last second field goal. Following their 2\u20132 start, the Chargers lost their next six games, dropping to 2\u20138. In their six straight losses, they lost heartbreakers to the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], [[Green Bay Packers]], [[Baltimore Ravens]] and the [[Chicago Bears]], as well as sound defeats by both, division rivals, the [[Oakland Raiders]] and the [[Kansas City Chiefs]]. They finally broke their losing streak by defeating the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] on the road, bringing their record to 3\u20138, in last place in the [[AFC West]] and 3rd worst in the [[American Football Conference]] (one game ahead of both the Browns and the [[Tennessee Titans]]). They are also tied for the third worst record in the [[National Football League]]. They then proceeded to beat the Miami Dolphins in Week 14 winning 30\u201314.

During its period in the AFL, the club also used a shield logo that featured a horsehead, a lightning bolt, and the word \"Chargers\". The team brought the logo back for on-field design in the 2018 season.\n\nFrom 1960 to 1973, the colors consisted of various shades of Electric blue (\"powder\" blue, but technically called Collegiate blue){{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} or white jerseys, both with gold lightning bolts on the shoulders. The helmets were white and had both the arc-shaped lightning bolt logo, in gold or navy depending on the year, and the player's number. At first, the team wore white pants before switching to gold in 1966. In 1973, the numerals on the blue jerseys changed from white to gold.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}\n\nIn [[1974 San Diego Chargers season|1974]], the sky blue was changed to dark royal blue. The helmet was also changed to dark blue and the players' numbers were removed. Additionally, the face masks became yellow, thus making them one of the first teams in the NFL (with the Kansas City Chiefs) to use a facemask color other than the then-predominant grey. From [[1978 San Diego Chargers season|1978]] through [[1983 San Diego Chargers season|1983]], the Chargers wore their white jerseys at home, coinciding with the hiring of coach Don Coryell&nbsp;\u2013 when [[Joe Gibbs]], a Coryell assistant in 1979\u201380, became head coach of the [[Washington Redskins]] in 1981, he did the same, and white at home became a Redskins staple through 2007 \u2013 but Coryell switched the Chargers to their blue jerseys at home starting in [[1984 San Diego Chargers season|1984]]. With the exception of the [[1991 San Diego Chargers season|1991 season]] and other sporadic home games since, San Diego wears its blue jerseys at home.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}\n\nIn [[1985 San Diego Chargers season|1985]], the Chargers started using navy blue jerseys and returned to wearing white pants. The team's uniform design was next revamped in 1988. It featured an even darker shade of navy blue. The lightning bolts on the jerseys and helmets were white, with navy interior trim and gold outlining; the facemasks became navy blue. In [[1990 San Diego Chargers season|1990]], the team started to wear navy pants with their white jerseys. From [[1988 San Diego Chargers season|1988]] to [[1991 San Diego Chargers season|1991]], the team displayed stripes down the pants rather than lightning bolts. The Chargers went with all-white combinations in [[1997 San Diego Chargers season|1997]] and [[2001 San Diego Chargers season|2001]], only to have the blue pants make a comeback. On October 27, 2003, the Chargers wore their navy pants with their navy jersey for a ''Monday Night Football'' game versus the [[Miami Dolphins]] that was played at [[Sun Devil Stadium]], then the home of the [[Arizona Cardinals]], due to wildfires in southern California. This remains the only game in which the Chargers have worn the all-dark combination.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}|\n\nFrom the late 1980s to 2000, the Chargers wore white at home during some preseason games and dark for regular season games. In [[2001 San Diego Chargers season|2001]], the Chargers started wearing their dark uniforms for preseason games and white uniforms in September home games due to the heat before switching back to dark in October.\n\nIn March 2007, the Chargers unveiled their first uniform redesign since 1988, on the team's official website. The team formally unveiled this new uniform set, which mixes old and new styles, in a private team-only event. Navy blue remains the primary color on the home jersey, but the familiar lightning bolt was reverted to gold, and now has navy outlining and powder blue interior trim. The latter color is a nod to the 1960s uniforms. The redesigned lightning bolt was moved to the sides of the shoulders from the top, and includes a new numbering font and word mark in white, with gold outlining and powder blue interior trim. The pants also have a redesigned lightning bolt in gold, with powder blue trim on a navy stripe. Additionally, the team pays tribute to other uniform features from their history by wearing a metallic white helmet, with a navy face mask, the newly revamped bolt in gold with navy and powder blue trim, and white pants. The road white jerseys with navy pants, as well as the alternate powder blue jerseys with white pants, were also redesigned with the new scheme.<ref>{{cite news|title=Chargers Unveil New Uniforms|url=http://www.chargers.com/news/2007/03/14/chargers-unveil-new-uniforms|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=Chargers.com|date=March 14, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160811143337/https://www.chargers.com/news/2007/03/14/chargers-unveil-new-uniforms|archive-date=August 11, 2016|access-date=June 10, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nFrom [[2002 San Diego Chargers season|2002]] to [[2006 San Diego Chargers season|2006]], the Chargers used the early-1960s powder blue uniforms as alternate jerseys, which many football fans (both of the Chargers and of other teams) clamored for the team to bring back full-time.\n\nSince [[2007 San Diego Chargers season|2007]], the Chargers have worn the alternate powder blue jerseys twice per season.

There are few recognized guidelines in sports regarding retiring numbers, and the NFL has no specific league policy.  \"You have to have enough numbers for players to wear\", said NFL spokesman Greg Aiello.<ref name=\"sullivan_03042010\">{{cite news|last=Sullivan |first=Tim |title=Retiring a number can be tricky math problem |date=March 4, 2010 |newspaper=The San Diego Union Tribune |url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2010/mar/04/retiring-number-tricky-math-sullivan/?print&page=all |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20121209005200/http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2010/mar/04/retiring-number-tricky-math-sullivan/?print&page=all |archivedate=December 9, 2012 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> The Chargers have rarely retired numbers.<ref name=\"schofield\">{{cite news|last=Scholfield|first=Steve|title=Chargers to honor AFL icon Alworth|date=July 14, 2005|newspaper=North County Times|url=http://www.nctimes.com/sports/columnists/scholfield/article_f4af5516-4838-5fc0-b49e-5c50de637f2f.html|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130104014613/http://www.nctimes.com/sports/columnists/scholfield/article_f4af5516-4838-5fc0-b49e-5c50de637f2f.html|url-status=dead|archivedate=January 4, 2013}}</ref> The ''[[San Diego Union-Tribune]]'' wrote, \"The [Chargers] tend to honor their heritage haphazardly.\"<ref name=\"sullivan_08152006\">{{cite news|last=Sullivan|first=Tim|title=This time, icon finally receives proper sendoff|date=August 15, 2006|newspaper=The San Diego Union-Tribune|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060815/news_1s15sullivan.html|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130202061617/http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060815/news_1s15sullivan.html|url-status=dead|archivedate=February 2, 2013}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers}};\"|'''Los Angeles Chargers retired numbers'''\n|-\n!

Packer replaced legendary P.A. announcer Bruce Binkowski, who went on to become the executive director of the Holiday and Poinsettia Bowl games, which are played at their former home, [[SDCCU Stadium]].\n\nWith the Chargers' return to Los Angeles in 2017, the team became a beneficiary of league scheduling policies. Both the Chargers and the [[Los Angeles Rams]] share the Los Angeles market, which is on the West Coast of the United States. This means that the Chargers cannot play home games, road division games against the [[Denver Broncos]] or [[Las Vegas Raiders]], or interconference road games against the [[NFC West]] (in seasons that the [[AFC West]] and NFC West meet in interconference play) in the early 10:00&nbsp;a.m. [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific time]] slot. In addition, they cannot play interconference home games at the same time or network as the Rams. As a result, both teams generally will have more limited scheduling options, and will also benefit by receiving more prime-time games than usual ([[National Football League on television#Chargers and Rams|click here]] for further information). Thus, regardless of the previous season's record, the Chargers will receive a disproportionate number of ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night]]'', ''[[Monday Night Football|Monday Night]]'' and/or ''[[Thursday Night Football|Thursday Night]]'' games, compared to the rest of the league. Additionally, if the Chargers and Rams are both playing at the same time on Sunday afternoons on a certain network (for instance, a Rams road game against an AFC opponent at the same time as a Charger home game with an NFC opponent with both on Fox, or the reverse where the Rams are on the road against an AFC opponent and the Chargers are at home against an AFC opponent on CBS), in the Los Angeles market, Fox and CBS have authorization to carry the extra game on their secondary sister stations; Fox games air on [[KCOP-TV]], while CBS games are aired on [[KCAL-TV]]. In 2020, the Chargers signed a multi-year preseason TV deal with [[KCBS-TV]] and [[KCAL-TV]] and will have a weekly show with the latest team news, replacing [[KABC-TV]] after three seasons (2017, 2018 and 2019) of televising Chargers preseason football. \n\n===Radio affiliates===\n[[File: San Diego Chargers radio affiliates.png|thumb|Map of radio affiliates]]\n[https://www.chargers.com/news/chargers-radio-network Chargers Radio Network]\n[http://www.chargers.com/news/2017/07/28/chargers-finalize-2017-broadcast-team-and-station-affiliates Chargers Finalize 2017 Broadcast Team and Station Affiliates]\n\n===English stations===\n\n====California====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers|border=2}};\" | City !! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers|border=2}};\" | Call Sign !! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers|border=2}};\" | Frequency\n|-\n| rowspan=5|Los Angeles || [[KFI]] || 640 AM (Previous affiliate from 2017-2020)\n|-\n| [[KOST]] || 103.5 HD2 (HD radio simulcast of [[KFI]], Previous affiliate from 2017-2020)\n|-\n| [[KYSR]]/[[KSRY]] || 98.7/103.1 FM (Pre-Game [first two-hours], Full Game Coverage and 'Chargers Talk' Post-Game)\n|-\n| [[KYSR]] || 98.7 HD2 (HD radio simulcast of [[KLAC]], will carry select games)\n|-\n| [[KLAC]] || 570 AM (Secondary affiliate to [[KYSR]], will carry select games)\n|-\n| rowspan=2|[[San Diego]] || [[KGB-FM]] || 101.5 FM\n|-\n| [[KLSD]] || 1360 AM\n|-\n| [[Temecula, California|Temecula]]/[[Inland Empire]] || [[KATY-FM]] || 101.3 FM\n|-\n| [[Yucca Valley, California|Yucca Valley]] || [[KNWH]] || 1250 AM\n|-\n| [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]] || [[KNWZ]] || 94.3 FM\n|-\n| [[Palmdale, California|Palmdale]]/[[Lancaster, California|Lancaster]] || [[KAVL]] || 610 AM\n|-\n| [[Victorville, California|Victorville]]/[[Hesperia, California|Hesperia]] || [[KMPS (AM)|KMPS]] || 910 AM\n|-\n| [[Imperial Valley]] || [[KXO-FM]] || 107.5 FM \n|}\n\n====Nevada====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers|border=2}};\" | City !! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers|border=2}};\" | Call Sign !! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers|border=2}};\" | Frequency\n|-\n| [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] || [[KKGK]] || 1340 AM\n|}\n\n===Spanish stations===\n\n====California====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers|border=2}};\" | City !! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers|border=2}};\" | Call Sign !! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers|border=2}};\" | Frequency\n|-\n| Los Angeles/[[Orange County, California|Orange County]] || [[KFWB]] || 980 AM\n|-\n| [[San Diego]]/[[Tijuana|Tijuana, Mexico]] || [[XEXX-AM]] || 1420 AM\n|}\n\n====Mexico====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers|border=2}};\" | City !! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers|border=2}};\" | Call Sign !! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers|border=2}};\" | Frequency\n|-\n|-\n| [[Mexicali, Mexico|Mexicali]] || [[XEHG-AM|XEHG]] || 1370 AM\n|-\n| [[Ensenada, Mexico|Ensenada]] || [[XHEPF-FM]] || 89.1 FM\n|}\n\n==Theme song==\n{{Main|San Diego Super Chargers}}\n\nThe Chargers' [[fight song]], \"[[San Diego Super Chargers]]\", was recorded in 1979 at the height of the team's success with [[Coryell offense|Air Coryell]], and has a distinctly [[disco]] sound.

[[John Betjeman]], in his 1955 introduction to ''Song at the Year's Turning'', the first collection of Thomas's poetry to be produced by a major publisher, predicted that Thomas would be remembered long after he himself was forgotten. M. Wynn Thomas said: \"He was the [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] of Wales because he was such a troubler of the Welsh conscience. He was one of the major English language and European poets of the 20th century.\"<ref>{{cite web |author=John Ezard and Geoff Gibbs |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/sep/27/books.booksnews |title=Wales loses its most sustained lyric voice |work=The Guardian |date=27 September 2000 |accessdate=15 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/arts-culture-news/authors-notes-m-wynn-thomas-7319653 |title=Author's Notes: M Wynn Thomas on RS Thomas in Wales Book of Year book |publisher=Wales Online |date=16 June 2014 |accessdate=15 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Life==\nR. S. Thomas was born in [[Cardiff]], the only child of Margaret (n\u00e9e Davies) and Thomas Hubert Thomas. The family moved to [[Holyhead]] in 1918 because of his father's work in the [[Merchant Navy (United Kingdom)|Merchant Navy]]. He was awarded a bursary in 1932 to study at the [[Bangor University|University College of North Wales]], where he read [[Latin]]. In 1936, after he completed his theological training at [[St Michael's College, Llandaff]], he was ordained as a priest in the Anglican [[Church in Wales]]. From 1936 to 1940 he was the curate of [[Chirk]], Denbighshire, where he met his future wife, [[Mildred Eldridge|Mildred \"Elsi\" Eldridge]], an English artist. He subsequently became curate-in charge of [[Willington Worthenbury|Tallarn Green]], [[Flintshire]], as part of his duties as curate of [[Hanmer, Wales|Hanmer]].\n\nIn Hanmer he was an assistant to the Rev. Thomas Meredith-Morris, grandfather of the writer [[Lorna Sage]], a fact later described by [[Byron Rogers (author)|Byron Rogers]] as a \"crossing of paths of two of Wales's strangest clergymen\". Whilst Sage devotes a great deal of her autobiography ''Bad Blood'' to her late relative, she does not mention Thomas, who was in any case in Hanmer before Sage was born. However, her memoir gives some insight into the strange environment in which Thomas worked as a young priest.<ref>[[Lorna Sage]] (2001), ''Bad Blood'', Fourth Estate.</ref> Thomas never wrote a great deal of his curacies and nothing is known of the relationship between him and Meredith-Morris.<ref>[[Byron G. Rogers]] (2006), ''The Man Who Went into the West: The Life of R. S. Thomas'', London: Aurum.</ref>\n\nThomas and Eldridge were married in 1940 and remained together until her death in 1991. Their son, (Andreas) Gwydion was born on 29 August 1945 and died on 15 September 2016.<ref>''The Man Who Went Into The West'', Byron Rogers, p. 154.</ref> Gwydion often spoke about his difficult upbringing with a family living in near poverty, while he was sent to a number of traumatic boarding schools.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/bbc-huw-thomas/gwydion-thomas/365725817110966/ |title=Gwydion Thomas |website=www.facebook.com |accessdate=2 September 2017}}</ref> The Thomas family lived on a tiny income and lacked the comforts of modern life, largely through their own choice. One of the few household amenities the family ever owned, a vacuum cleaner, was rejected because Thomas decided it was too noisy.<ref name=dalrymple>Theodore Dalrymple, [http://www.city-journal.org/html/rev2006-11-06td.html \"A Man Out of Time: A life of poet R.

Retrieved 30 December 2006.</ref>\n\nFrom 1942 to 1954 Thomas was rector of [[St Michael's Church, Manafon]], near [[Welshpool]] in rural [[Montgomeryshire]]. It was during his time there that he first began to study Welsh and that he published his first three volumes of poetry, ''The Stones of the Field'' (1946), ''An Acre of Land'' (1952) and ''The Minister'' (1953). Thomas's poetry achieved a breakthrough with the publication, in 1955, of his fourth book, ''Song at the Year's Turning'', in effect a collected edition of his first three volumes, which was critically very well received and opened with Betjeman's famous introduction. His position was also helped by winning the [[Royal Society of Literature]]'s Heinemann Award.\n\n[[File:Aberdaron church - geograph.org.uk - 13372.jpg|thumb|right|[[Church of St Hywyn, Aberdaron|St Hywyn's Church]] in [[Aberdaron]] where Thomas was vicar from 1967 to 1978]]\n[[File:Young Poet by R S Thomas.ogv|thumb|Thomas's \"To a Young Poet\", read by Falstaoff, [[Rice University]]]]\nThomas learnt the Welsh language at the age of 30,<ref name=dalrymple/> \u2013 too late in life, he said, to be able to write poetry in it. The 1960s saw him working in a predominantly Welsh-speaking community and he later wrote two prose works in Welsh, ''Neb'' (''Nobody''), an ironic and revealing autobiography written in the third person, and ''Blwyddyn yn Ll\u0177n'' (''A Year in Ll\u0177n''). In 1964 he won the [[Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry]].

Thomas's ashes are buried close to the door of St John's Church, [[Porthmadog]], Gwynedd.\n\n==Beliefs and contribution to spirituality==\n===Religious views===\nThomas's son, Gwydion, a resident of [[Thailand]], recalls his father's sermons, in which he would \"drone on\" to absurd lengths about the evil of refrigerators, washing machines, televisions and other modern devices. Thomas preached that they were all part of the temptation of scrambling after gadgets rather than attending to more spiritual needs. \"It was the Machine, you see,\" Gwydion explained to a biographer. \"This to a congregation that didn't have any of these things and were longing for them.\"<ref name=dalrymple/> Although he may have taken some ideas to extreme lengths, Theodore Dalrymple wrote, Thomas \"was raising a deep and unanswered question: What is life for? Is it simply to consume more and more, and divert ourselves with ever more elaborate entertainments and gadgetry? What will this do to our souls?\"<ref name=dalrymple/> He had a reputation, which perhaps he cultivated, of being not always charitable and for being awkward and taciturn. Some critics have interpreted photographs of him as indicating he was \"formidable, bad-tempered, and apparently humourless.\"<ref name=dalrymple/>\n\nIn terms of religion, although he sometimes appeared to lack charity and patience, Thomas served as a [[Church in Wales]] parish priest all his working life. His training at [[St Michael's College, Llandaff]] placed him somewhat in the [[Oxford Movement|Tractarian Tradition]], though he does not seem to have been more than central in his position as regards the conduct of services.<ref>J. Wintle, 1997, ''Furious Interiors: Wales, RS Thomas and God'', London, Flamingo.</ref> Although a fervent Welsh nationalist, he appears to have preferred the 1662 [[Book of Common Prayer]] of the [[Church of England]] (even in Welsh translation) over the 1966 order for the Holy Eucharist which the Church in Wales produced for itself and which came into use during his final year at [[Eglwys Fach]]. In one of his autobiographical books, he asserted that (in retirement) he found that he could no longer bring himself to go to [[Holy Communion]] on account of the changes, although one of his successors at Aberdaron did indicate that Thomas always retained the bishop's permission to officiate and occasionally did so at [[Llanfaelrhys]], when no one else could be found.<ref>R. S. Thomas (1997), '' Autobiographies'', (translated by Damian Walford Davies), London: Orion.</ref> His prime objection to the revised services was that since the [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962\u201365) \u2013 which also had liturgical repercussions within Anglicanism \u2013 he could not bear to see the priest facing the people when in reality he should be leading the people towards God from the traditional east-facing position. \"It is to God that the mystery belongs,\" he wrote pointedly, \"and woe to man when he interferes with that mystery. As T. S. Eliot says: 'Humankind cannot bear very much reality.'\"{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nThomas seems early on to have become interested in [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] (an interest he did not pursue beyond some interfaith study) and over time he appears to have had some sympathy with the theological explorations of one-time [[Bishop of Woolwich]] [[John Robinson (bishop of Woolwich)|John A. T. Robinson]] in his 1963 ''Honest to God'', on one occasion going as far as to describe the [[Resurrection of Christ]] as a \"metaphor\". In a letter to a theological student in 1993 he denied he held similar views to the non-realist Cambridge theologian and philosopher [[Don Cupitt]]. \"I believe in revelation,\" Thomas wrote, \"and therefore one cannot describe all one's insights as entirely human.\"{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Above all, his main influence appears to have been the philosopher [[Kierkegaard]] \u2013 and his \"leap of faith\" \u2013 although he also appears to have concerned himself with the limitations of religious language in the face of an era which was becoming progressively more post-Christian in the face of science and philosophy. Yet for all his explorations, his sermons and practice as a priest do not seem to have been in any way heterodox,<ref>B. Rogers (2006), ''The Man who Went into the West: the Life of R. S. Thomas'', London: Aurum</ref> even if in retirement he was to write to his long-term friend, the poet [[Raymond Garlick]],<ref>R. S. Thomas (2009), ''Letters to Raymond Garlick'', Llandyssul: [[Gomer Press|Gomer]].</ref> to give him \"the address of a retired Christian\".\n\nAs a priest, it seems that Thomas did not believe he was there to promote his own views, but those of the church he served, and for all his vaunted crabbiness, he seems to have been well enough regarded by parishioners, even if the biographies offer notable exceptions. He has been credited by some as a capable listener and counsellor at a time when such things were not in common vogue among the clergy, and to have been also a devoted visitor to the sick. His tendency, however, to be remote did lead to one of his successors saying that she had, as parish priest of Aberdaron, to \"do a lot of healing\". Yet in spite of this, his influence as a poet had a considerable impact on spirituality, to the extent that, at the centenary of his birth, [[Archbishop of Wales]], [[Barry Morgan]], who had known the poet personally, paid tribute to Thomas:\n<blockquote>\nR. S. Thomas continues to articulate through his poetry questions that are inscribed on the heart of most Christian pilgrims in their search for meaning and truth. We search for God and feel Him near at hand, only then to blink and find Him gone. This poetry persuades us that we are not alone in this experience of faith \u2013 the poet has been there before us.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-22494073 |title=RS Thomas centenary celebrated by Bangor Cathedral service |publisher=BBC |date=11 May 2013 |accessdate=15 March 2015}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Other views==\nThomas believed in what he called \"the true Wales of my imagination\", a Welsh-speaking aboriginal community that was in tune with the natural world.<ref>R. S. Thomas (1997), edited and translated by Jason Walford Davies. ''Autobiographies''. London: J. M. Dent, p. 10, cited in Brown, Tony.

[[University of Wales Press]], 2006.</ref>  He viewed western (specifically English) materialism and greed, represented in the poetry by his mythical \"Machine\", as the destroyers of community. He could tolerate neither the English who bought up Wales, and in his view stripped it of its wild and essential nature, nor the Welsh whom he saw as all too eager to kowtow to English money and influence.<ref>Tony Brown, ''R. S. Thomas''. [[University of Wales Press]], 2006.</ref>\n\nThomas was an ardent supporter of the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] (CND) and described himself as a [[Pacifism|pacifist]], but also supported the terrorist ''[[Meibion Glynd\u0175r]]'' fire bombings of English-owned holiday cottages in rural Wales. On this subject he said in 1998, \"What is one death against the death of the whole Welsh nation?\"<ref name=guardian>[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/sep/27/books.booksnews \"Wales loses its most sustained lyric voice Hermit-like poet R. S. Thomas dies aged 87\", ''Guardian''.]</ref> He was also active in wildlife preservation and worked with the [[RSPB]] and Welsh volunteer organisations for the preservation of the [[red kite]]. He resigned his RSPB membership over their plans to introduce non-native kites to Wales.\n\n==Works==\n{{Quote box |width=280px |align=right |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right\n |quote =<poem>\n'''Evans'''\n\nEvans? Yes, many a time\nI came down his bare flight\nOf stairs into the gaunt kitchen\nWith its wood fire, where crickets sang\nAccompaniment to the black kettle's\nWhine, and so into the cold\nDark to smother in the thick tide\nOf night that drifted about the walls\nOf his stark farm on the hill ridge.\n\nIt was not the dark filling my eyes\nAnd mouth appalled me; not even the drip\nOf rain like blood from the one tree\nWeather-tortured. It was the dark\nSilting the veins of that sick man\nI left stranded upon the vast\nAnd lonely shore of his bleak bed.\n\n</poem>|source = \"Evans\" from ''Poetry for Supper'' (1958)}}\n\nAlmost all of Thomas's work concerns the Welsh landscape and the Welsh people, themes with both political and spiritual subtext. His views on the position of the Welsh people, as a conquered people are never far below the surface. As a cleric, his religious views are also present in his works. His earlier works focus on the personal stories of his parishioners, the farm labourers and working men and their wives, challenging the cosy view of the traditional pastoral poem with harsh and vivid descriptions of rural lives. The beauty of the landscape, although ever-present, is never suggested as a compensation for the low pay or monotonous conditions of farm work. This direct view of \"country life\" comes as a challenge to many English writers writing on similar subjects and challenging the more pastoral works of contemporary poets such as [[Dylan Thomas]].\n\nThomas's later works were of a more [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] nature, more experimental in their style and focusing more overtly on his spirituality. ''Laboratories of the Spirit'' (1975) gives, in its title, a hint at this development and also reveals Thomas's increasing experiments with scientific metaphor. He described this shift as an investigation into the \"adult geometry of the mind\". Fearing that poetry was becoming a dying art, inaccessible to those who most needed it, \"he attempted to make spiritually minded poems relevant within, and relevant to, a science-minded, post-industrial world,\" to represent that world both in form and in content even as he rejected its machinations.<ref>Daniel Westover, ''R. S. Thomas: A Stylistic Biography''. [[University of Wales Press]], 2011.</ref>\n\nDespite his nationalism Thomas could be hard on his fellow countrymen. Often his works read as more of a criticism of Welshness than a celebration. He himself said there is a \"lack of love for human beings\" in his poetry. Other critics have not been so harsh. [[Al Alvarez]] said, \"He was wonderful, very pure, very bitter, but the bitterness was beautifully and very sparely rendered. He was completely authoritative, a very, very fine poet, completely off on his own, out of the loop but a real individual. It's not about being a major or minor poet. It's about getting a work absolutely right by your own standards and he did that wonderfully well.\"<ref name=guardian/>\n\nThomas's final works commonly sold 20,000 copies in Britain alone.<ref name=dalrymple/>\n\n==Books==\n{{colbegin}}\n*''The Stones of the Field'' (1946) Druid Press, Carmarthen\n*''An Acre of Land'' (1952) Mongtomeryshire Printing Co, Newtown\n*''The Minister'' (1953) Mongtomeryshire Printing Co, Newtown\n*''Song at the Year's Turning'' (1955) [[Rupert Hart-Davis]], London\n*''Poetry for Supper'' (1958) Rupert Hart-Davis, London\n* ''Judgement Day'', [[Poetry Book Society]], 1960\n*''Tares'', [Corn-weed] (1961) Rupert Hart-Davis, London\n*''The Bread of Truth'' (1963) Rupert Hart-Davis, London\n*''Words and the Poet'' (1964, lecture) [[University of Wales Press]], Cardiff\n*''Piet\u00e0'' (1966) Rupert Hart-Davis, London\n* ''The Mountains'' (1968) illustrations by [[John Piper (artist)|John Piper]], Chilmark Press\n* ''Postcard: Song'' (1968) Fishpaste Postcard Series\n*''Not That He Brought Flowers'' (1968) Rupert Hart-Davis, London\n*''H'm'' (1972) [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]], London\n*''Selected Poems, 1946\u20131968'', Hart-Davis MacGibbon, 1973 and [[St. Martin's Press]], New York, 1974; [[Bloodaxe Books]], Newcastle upon Tyne, 1986\n*''What is a Welshman?''

[[John Betjeman]], in his 1955 introduction to ''Song at the Year's Turning'', the first collection of Thomas's poetry to be produced by a major publisher, predicted that Thomas would be remembered long after he himself was forgotten.

He was one of the major English language and European poets of the 20th century.\"<ref>{{cite web |author=John Ezard and Geoff Gibbs |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/sep/27/books.booksnews |title=Wales loses its most sustained lyric voice |work=The Guardian |date=27 September 2000 |accessdate=15 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/arts-culture-news/authors-notes-m-wynn-thomas-7319653 |title=Author's Notes: M Wynn Thomas on RS Thomas in Wales Book of Year book |publisher=Wales Online |date=16 June 2014 |accessdate=15 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Life==\nR. S. Thomas was born in [[Cardiff]], the only child of Margaret (n\u00e9e Davies) and Thomas Hubert Thomas. The family moved to [[Holyhead]] in 1918 because of his father's work in the [[Merchant Navy (United Kingdom)|Merchant Navy]]. He was awarded a bursary in 1932 to study at the [[Bangor University|University College of North Wales]], where he read [[Latin]]. In 1936, after he completed his theological training at [[St Michael's College, Llandaff]], he was ordained as a priest in the Anglican [[Church in Wales]]. From 1936 to 1940 he was the curate of [[Chirk]], Denbighshire, where he met his future wife, [[Mildred Eldridge|Mildred \"Elsi\" Eldridge]], an English artist. He subsequently became curate-in charge of [[Willington Worthenbury|Tallarn Green]], [[Flintshire]], as part of his duties as curate of [[Hanmer, Wales|Hanmer]].\n\nIn Hanmer he was an assistant to the Rev. Thomas Meredith-Morris, grandfather of the writer [[Lorna Sage]], a fact later described by [[Byron Rogers (author)|Byron Rogers]] as a \"crossing of paths of two of Wales's strangest clergymen\". Whilst Sage devotes a great deal of her autobiography ''Bad Blood'' to her late relative, she does not mention Thomas, who was in any case in Hanmer before Sage was born. However, her memoir gives some insight into the strange environment in which Thomas worked as a young priest.<ref>[[Lorna Sage]] (2001), ''Bad Blood'', Fourth Estate.</ref> Thomas never wrote a great deal of his curacies and nothing is known of the relationship between him and Meredith-Morris.<ref>[[Byron G. Rogers]] (2006), ''The Man Who Went into the West: The Life of R. S. Thomas'', London: Aurum.</ref>\n\nThomas and Eldridge were married in 1940 and remained together until her death in 1991. Their son, (Andreas) Gwydion was born on 29 August 1945 and died on 15 September 2016.<ref>''The Man Who Went Into The West'', Byron Rogers, p. 154.</ref> Gwydion often spoke about his difficult upbringing with a family living in near poverty, while he was sent to a number of traumatic boarding schools.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/bbc-huw-thomas/gwydion-thomas/365725817110966/ |title=Gwydion Thomas |website=www.facebook.com |accessdate=2 September 2017}}</ref> The Thomas family lived on a tiny income and lacked the comforts of modern life, largely through their own choice.

It was during his time there that he first began to study Welsh and that he published his first three volumes of poetry, ''The Stones of the Field'' (1946), ''An Acre of Land'' (1952) and ''The Minister'' (1953). Thomas's poetry achieved a breakthrough with the publication, in 1955, of his fourth book, ''Song at the Year's Turning'', in effect a collected edition of his first three volumes, which was critically very well received and opened with Betjeman's famous introduction. His position was also helped by winning the [[Royal Society of Literature]]'s Heinemann Award.\n\n[[File:Aberdaron church - geograph.org.uk - 13372.jpg|thumb|right|[[Church of St Hywyn, Aberdaron|St Hywyn's Church]] in [[Aberdaron]] where Thomas was vicar from 1967 to 1978]]\n[[File:Young Poet by R S Thomas.ogv|thumb|Thomas's \"To a Young Poet\", read by Falstaoff, [[Rice University]]]]\nThomas learnt the Welsh language at the age of 30,<ref name=dalrymple/> \u2013 too late in life, he said, to be able to write poetry in it.

Thomas's ashes are buried close to the door of St John's Church, [[Porthmadog]], Gwynedd.\n\n==Beliefs and contribution to spirituality==\n===Religious views===\nThomas's son, Gwydion, a resident of [[Thailand]], recalls his father's sermons, in which he would \"drone on\" to absurd lengths about the evil of refrigerators, washing machines, televisions and other modern devices. Thomas preached that they were all part of the temptation of scrambling after gadgets rather than attending to more spiritual needs. \"It was the Machine, you see,\" Gwydion explained to a biographer. \"This to a congregation that didn't have any of these things and were longing for them.\"<ref name=dalrymple/> Although he may have taken some ideas to extreme lengths, Theodore Dalrymple wrote, Thomas \"was raising a deep and unanswered question: What is life for? Is it simply to consume more and more, and divert ourselves with ever more elaborate entertainments and gadgetry? What will this do to our souls?\"<ref name=dalrymple/> He had a reputation, which perhaps he cultivated, of being not always charitable and for being awkward and taciturn. Some critics have interpreted photographs of him as indicating he was \"formidable, bad-tempered, and apparently humourless.\"<ref name=dalrymple/>\n\nIn terms of religion, although he sometimes appeared to lack charity and patience, Thomas served as a [[Church in Wales]] parish priest all his working life. His training at [[St Michael's College, Llandaff]] placed him somewhat in the [[Oxford Movement|Tractarian Tradition]], though he does not seem to have been more than central in his position as regards the conduct of services.<ref>J. Wintle, 1997, ''Furious Interiors: Wales, RS Thomas and God'', London, Flamingo.</ref> Although a fervent Welsh nationalist, he appears to have preferred the 1662 [[Book of Common Prayer]] of the [[Church of England]] (even in Welsh translation) over the 1966 order for the Holy Eucharist which the Church in Wales produced for itself and which came into use during his final year at [[Eglwys Fach]]. In one of his autobiographical books, he asserted that (in retirement) he found that he could no longer bring himself to go to [[Holy Communion]] on account of the changes, although one of his successors at Aberdaron did indicate that Thomas always retained the bishop's permission to officiate and occasionally did so at [[Llanfaelrhys]], when no one else could be found.<ref>R. S. Thomas (1997), '' Autobiographies'', (translated by Damian Walford Davies), London: Orion.</ref> His prime objection to the revised services was that since the [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962\u201365) \u2013 which also had liturgical repercussions within Anglicanism \u2013 he could not bear to see the priest facing the people when in reality he should be leading the people towards God from the traditional east-facing position. \"It is to God that the mystery belongs,\" he wrote pointedly, \"and woe to man when he interferes with that mystery. As T. S. Eliot says: 'Humankind cannot bear very much reality.'\"{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nThomas seems early on to have become interested in [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] (an interest he did not pursue beyond some interfaith study) and over time he appears to have had some sympathy with the theological explorations of one-time [[Bishop of Woolwich]] [[John Robinson (bishop of Woolwich)|John A. T. Robinson]] in his 1963 ''Honest to God'', on one occasion going as far as to describe the [[Resurrection of Christ]] as a \"metaphor\". In a letter to a theological student in 1993 he denied he held similar views to the non-realist Cambridge theologian and philosopher [[Don Cupitt]]. \"I believe in revelation,\" Thomas wrote, \"and therefore one cannot describe all one's insights as entirely human.\"{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Above all, his main influence appears to have been the philosopher [[Kierkegaard]] \u2013 and his \"leap of faith\" \u2013 although he also appears to have concerned himself with the limitations of religious language in the face of an era which was becoming progressively more post-Christian in the face of science and philosophy. Yet for all his explorations, his sermons and practice as a priest do not seem to have been in any way heterodox,<ref>B. Rogers (2006), ''The Man who Went into the West: the Life of R. S. Thomas'', London: Aurum</ref> even if in retirement he was to write to his long-term friend, the poet [[Raymond Garlick]],<ref>R. S. Thomas (2009), ''Letters to Raymond Garlick'', Llandyssul: [[Gomer Press|Gomer]].</ref> to give him \"the address of a retired Christian\".\n\nAs a priest, it seems that Thomas did not believe he was there to promote his own views, but those of the church he served, and for all his vaunted crabbiness, he seems to have been well enough regarded by parishioners, even if the biographies offer notable exceptions. He has been credited by some as a capable listener and counsellor at a time when such things were not in common vogue among the clergy, and to have been also a devoted visitor to the sick. His tendency, however, to be remote did lead to one of his successors saying that she had, as parish priest of Aberdaron, to \"do a lot of healing\". Yet in spite of this, his influence as a poet had a considerable impact on spirituality, to the extent that, at the centenary of his birth, [[Archbishop of Wales]], [[Barry Morgan]], who had known the poet personally, paid tribute to Thomas:\n<blockquote>\nR. S. Thomas continues to articulate through his poetry questions that are inscribed on the heart of most Christian pilgrims in their search for meaning and truth. We search for God and feel Him near at hand, only then to blink and find Him gone. This poetry persuades us that we are not alone in this experience of faith \u2013 the poet has been there before us.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-22494073 |title=RS Thomas centenary celebrated by Bangor Cathedral service |publisher=BBC |date=11 May 2013 |accessdate=15 March 2015}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Other views==\nThomas believed in what he called \"the true Wales of my imagination\", a Welsh-speaking aboriginal community that was in tune with the natural world.<ref>R. S. Thomas (1997), edited and translated by Jason Walford Davies. ''Autobiographies''. London: J. M. Dent, p. 10, cited in Brown, Tony.

[[University of Wales Press]], 2006.</ref>  He viewed western (specifically English) materialism and greed, represented in the poetry by his mythical \"Machine\", as the destroyers of community. He could tolerate neither the English who bought up Wales, and in his view stripped it of its wild and essential nature, nor the Welsh whom he saw as all too eager to kowtow to English money and influence.<ref>Tony Brown, ''R. S. Thomas''. [[University of Wales Press]], 2006.</ref>\n\nThomas was an ardent supporter of the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] (CND) and described himself as a [[Pacifism|pacifist]], but also supported the terrorist ''[[Meibion Glynd\u0175r]]'' fire bombings of English-owned holiday cottages in rural Wales. On this subject he said in 1998, \"What is one death against the death of the whole Welsh nation?\"<ref name=guardian>[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/sep/27/books.booksnews \"Wales loses its most sustained lyric voice Hermit-like poet R. S. Thomas dies aged 87\", ''Guardian''.]</ref> He was also active in wildlife preservation and worked with the [[RSPB]] and Welsh volunteer organisations for the preservation of the [[red kite]]. He resigned his RSPB membership over their plans to introduce non-native kites to Wales.\n\n==Works==\n{{Quote box |width=280px |align=right |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right\n |quote =<poem>\n'''Evans'''\n\nEvans? Yes, many a time\nI came down his bare flight\nOf stairs into the gaunt kitchen\nWith its wood fire, where crickets sang\nAccompaniment to the black kettle's\nWhine, and so into the cold\nDark to smother in the thick tide\nOf night that drifted about the walls\nOf his stark farm on the hill ridge.\n\nIt was not the dark filling my eyes\nAnd mouth appalled me; not even the drip\nOf rain like blood from the one tree\nWeather-tortured. It was the dark\nSilting the veins of that sick man\nI left stranded upon the vast\nAnd lonely shore of his bleak bed.\n\n</poem>|source = \"Evans\" from ''Poetry for Supper'' (1958)}}\n\nAlmost all of Thomas's work concerns the Welsh landscape and the Welsh people, themes with both political and spiritual subtext. His views on the position of the Welsh people, as a conquered people are never far below the surface. As a cleric, his religious views are also present in his works. His earlier works focus on the personal stories of his parishioners, the farm labourers and working men and their wives, challenging the cosy view of the traditional pastoral poem with harsh and vivid descriptions of rural lives. The beauty of the landscape, although ever-present, is never suggested as a compensation for the low pay or monotonous conditions of farm work. This direct view of \"country life\" comes as a challenge to many English writers writing on similar subjects and challenging the more pastoral works of contemporary poets such as [[Dylan Thomas]].\n\nThomas's later works were of a more [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] nature, more experimental in their style and focusing more overtly on his spirituality. ''Laboratories of the Spirit'' (1975) gives, in its title, a hint at this development and also reveals Thomas's increasing experiments with scientific metaphor. He described this shift as an investigation into the \"adult geometry of the mind\". Fearing that poetry was becoming a dying art, inaccessible to those who most needed it, \"he attempted to make spiritually minded poems relevant within, and relevant to, a science-minded, post-industrial world,\" to represent that world both in form and in content even as he rejected its machinations.<ref>Daniel Westover, ''R. S. Thomas: A Stylistic Biography''. [[University of Wales Press]], 2011.</ref>\n\nDespite his nationalism Thomas could be hard on his fellow countrymen. Often his works read as more of a criticism of Welshness than a celebration. He himself said there is a \"lack of love for human beings\" in his poetry. Other critics have not been so harsh. [[Al Alvarez]] said, \"He was wonderful, very pure, very bitter, but the bitterness was beautifully and very sparely rendered. He was completely authoritative, a very, very fine poet, completely off on his own, out of the loop but a real individual. It's not about being a major or minor poet. It's about getting a work absolutely right by your own standards and he did that wonderfully well.\"<ref name=guardian/>\n\nThomas's final works commonly sold 20,000 copies in Britain alone.<ref name=dalrymple/>\n\n==Books==\n{{colbegin}}\n*''The Stones of the Field'' (1946) Druid Press, Carmarthen\n*''An Acre of Land'' (1952) Mongtomeryshire Printing Co, Newtown\n*''The Minister'' (1953) Mongtomeryshire Printing Co, Newtown\n*''Song at the Year's Turning'' (1955) [[Rupert Hart-Davis]], London\n*''Poetry for Supper'' (1958) Rupert Hart-Davis, London\n* ''Judgement Day'', [[Poetry Book Society]], 1960\n*''Tares'', [Corn-weed] (1961) Rupert Hart-Davis, London\n*''The Bread of Truth'' (1963) Rupert Hart-Davis, London\n*''Words and the Poet'' (1964, lecture) [[University of Wales Press]], Cardiff\n*''Piet\u00e0'' (1966) Rupert Hart-Davis, London\n* ''The Mountains'' (1968) illustrations by [[John Piper (artist)|John Piper]], Chilmark Press\n* ''Postcard: Song'' (1968) Fishpaste Postcard Series\n*''Not That He Brought Flowers'' (1968) Rupert Hart-Davis, London\n*''H'm'' (1972) [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]], London\n*''Selected Poems, 1946\u20131968'', Hart-Davis MacGibbon, 1973 and [[St. Martin's Press]], New York, 1974; [[Bloodaxe Books]], Newcastle upon Tyne, 1986\n*''What is a Welshman?''

He also wrote in and translated from English and French.\n\nPessoa was a prolific writer, and not only under his own name, for he created approximately seventy-five others. He did not call them all ''pseudonyms'' because he felt that some did not capture their true independent intellectual life and instead called them [[Heteronym (literature)|''heteronyms'']].

When Pessoa was five, his father, Joaquim de Seabra Pess\u00f4a, died of [[tuberculosis]] and the following year, on 2 January, his younger brother Jorge, aged one, also died.\n\nAfter the second marriage of his mother, Maria Magdalena Pinheiro Nogueira, proxy wedding to Jo\u00e3o Miguel dos Santos Rosa, Fernando sailed with his mother for South Africa in the beginning of 1896, to join his stepfather, a military officer appointed Portuguese [[Consul (representative)|consul]] in [[Durban]], capital of the former British [[Colony of Natal]]. Later on, in 1918, Pessoa wrote a letter in which refers:\n\n[[File:FP triciclo.jpg|thumb|200px| Last year in Lisbon before moving to Durban, 1894, aged 6.]]\n\n{{bquote \n|There is only one event in the past which has both the definiteness and the importance required for rectification by direction; this is my father's death, which took place on 13 July 1893.

He moved to the [[Durban High School]] in April 1899, becoming fluent in English and developing an appreciation for English literature. During the [[Matriculation examination|Matriculation Examination]], held at the time by the University of the Cape of Good Hope (forerunner of the [[University of Cape Town]]), in November 1903, he was awarded the recently created [[Queen Victoria]] Memorial Prize for best paper in English. While preparing to enter university, he also attended the Durban Commercial High School during one year, taking night classes.\n\n[[File:Pessoa 1898.jpg|thumb|200px|Pessoa in Durban, 1898, aged 10.]]\n\nMeanwhile, Pessoa started writing short stories in English, some under the name of David Merrick, many of which he left unfinished.<ref name = \"Zenith, Richard 2008\">Zenith, Richard (2008), ''Fotobiografias S\u00e9culo XX: Fernando Pessoa'', Lisboa: C\u00edrculo de Leitores.</ref> At the age of sixteen, ''[[The Natal Mercury]]''<ref>[http://www.themercury.co.za/ ''The Natal Mercury'']</ref> (edition of 6 July 1904) published his poem \"Hillier did first usurp the realms of rhyme...\", under the name of C.

In addition to Charles Robert Anon and David Merrick, the young writer also signed up, among other pen names, as Horace James Faber, Alexander Search, and other meaningful names.\n\nIn the preface to ''The Book of Disquiet'', Pessoa wrote about himself:\n\n{{bquote|Nothing had ever obliged him to do anything. He had spent his childhood alone. He never joined any group. He never pursued a course of study. He never belonged to a crowd.

How old he was at this time I don\u2019t know, but judge him to have 15 or 16. [...]\n\nHe was pale and thin and appeared physically to be very imperfectly developed. He had a narrow and contracted chest and was inclined to stoop. He had a peculiar walk and some defect in his eyesight gave to his eyes also a peculiar appearance, the lids seemed to drop over the eyes. [...]\n\nHe was regarded as a brilliant clever boy as, in spite of the fact that he had not spoken English in his early years, he had learned it so rapidly and so well that he had a splendid style in that language. Although younger than his schoolfellows of the same class he appeared to have no difficulty in keeping up with and surpassing them in work. For one of his age, he thought much and deeply and in a letter to me once complained of \"spiritual and material encumbrances of most especial adverseness\". [...]\n\nHe took no part in athletic sports of any kind and I think his spare time was spent on reading. We generally considered that he worked far too much and that he would ruin his health by so doing.<ref>Clifford E. Geerdts, letter to ''Dr. Faustino Antunes'', 10 April 1907.

This journey inspired the poems \"Opi\u00e1rio\" (dedicated to his friend, the poet and writer [[M\u00e1rio de S\u00e1-Carneiro]]) published in March 1915, in ''[[Gera\u00e7\u00e3o de Orpheu|Orpheu]]'' nr.1<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/23620 ''Orpheu'' nr.1]</ref> and \"Ode Mar\u00edtima\" (dedicated to the futurist painter [[Guilherme de Santa-Rita|Santa-Rita]]) published in June 1915, in ''Orpheu'' nr.2<ref>{{citation | publisher = [[Project Gutenberg]] | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/23621 | title = Orpheu | issue = 2}}.</ref> by his [[heteronym (literature)|heteronym]] [[\u00c1lvaro de Campos]].\n\n==Lisbon revisited==\n\n[[File:Papel timbrado da Empresa Ibis 1.jpg|thumb|200px|\"Ibis Enterprise\", the first firm established by Pessoa, in 1909.]]\n\nWhile his family remained in South Africa, Pessoa returned to Lisbon in 1905 to study diplomacy. After a period of illness, and two years of poor results, a [[student strike]] against the dictatorship of Prime Minister [[Jo\u00e3o Franco]] put an end to his formal studies. Pessoa became an autodidact, a devoted reader who spent a lot of time at the library. In August 1907, he started working as a practitioner at  R.G. Dun & Company, an American mercantile information agency (currently D&B, Dun & Bradstreet). His grandmother died in September and left him a small inheritance, which he spent on setting up his own publishing house, the \"Empreza Ibis\". The venture was not successful and closed down in 1910, but the name [[ibis]],<ref>Ibe name \"ibis\" has a very long literary tradition: the elegiac poem ''Ibis'' by [[Ovid]] was inspired in the lost poem of the same title by [[Callimachus]].</ref> the sacred bird of [[Ancient Egypt]] and inventor of the alphabet in [[Greek mythology]], would remain an important symbolic reference for him.\n\nPessoa returned to his uncompleted formal studies, complementing his British education with self-directed study of Portuguese culture. The pre-revolutionary atmosphere surrounding the assassination of King [[Carlos I of Portugal|Charles I]] and Crown Prince [[Lu\u00eds Filipe, Prince Royal of Portugal|Lu\u00eds Filipe]] in 1908, and the patriotic outburst resulting from the successful [[5 October 1910 revolution|republican revolution]] in 1910, influenced the development of the budding writer; as did his step-uncle, Henrique dos Santos Rosa, a poet and retired soldier, who introduced the young Pessoa to Portuguese poetry, notably the romantics and symbolists of the 19th century.<ref>{{citation | language = Portuguese | last = Zenith | first = Richard | year = 2008 | series = Fotobiografias do S\u00e9culo XX | title = Fernando Pessoa | place = Lisboa | publisher = C\u00edrculo de Leitores | page = 78}}.</ref>  In 1912, Fernando Pessoa entered the literary world with a critical essay, published in the cultural journal ''A \u00c1guia'', which triggered one of the most important literary debates in the Portuguese intellectual world of the 20th century: the polemic regarding a super-[[Cam\u00f5es]].

The translation of a poem should therefore conform absolutely (1) to the idea or emotion which constitutes the poem, (2) to the verbal rhythm in which that idea or emotion is expressed; it should conform relatively to the inner or visual rhythm, keeping to the images themselves when it can, but keeping always to the type of image.\nIt was on this criterion that I based my translation into Portuguese of Poe\u2019s \"Annabel Lee\" and \"Ulalume\", which I translated, not because of their great intrinsic worth, but because they were a standing challenge to translators.<ref>{{citation | last = Pessoa | first = Fernando | year = 1967 | title = P\u00e1ginas de Est\u00e9tica e de Teoria e Cr\u00edtica Liter\u00e1rias| place = Lisbon | publisher = \u00c1tica | isbn = }}.</ref>}}\n\nIn addition, Pessoa translated into Portuguese some books by the leading [[theosophists]] [[Helena Blavatsky]], [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]], [[Annie Besant]], and [[Mabel Collins]].<ref>\n[http://purl.pt/14427/2/ ''A Voz do Sil\u00eancio''] (The Voice of Silence) at the Portuguese National Library.\n<br/>Besant, Annie (1915), ''Os Ideaes da Theosophia'', Lisboa: Livraria Cl\u00e1ssica Editora.<br/>\nLeadbeater, C.

I wrote thirty some poems in a row, all in a kind of ecstasy, the nature of which I shall never fathom. It was the triumphant day of my life, and I shall never have another like it. I began with a title, The Keeper of Sheep. And what followed was the appearance of someone within me to whom I promptly assigned the name of Alberto Caeiro. Please excuse the absurdity of what I am about to say, but there had appeared within me, then and there, my own master. It was my immediate sensation. So much so that, with those thirty odd poems written, I immediately took up another sheet of paper and wrote as well, in a row, the six poems that make up \"Oblique Rain\" by Fernando Pessoa. Immediately and totally... It was the return from Fernando Pessoa/Alberto Caeiro to Fernando Pessoa alone. Or better still, it was Fernando Pessoa\u2019s reaction to his own inexistence as Alberto Caeiro.<ref>Fernando Pessoa, letter to Adolfo Casais Monteiro, 13 January 1935, transl. by George Monteiro,[https://www.brown.edu/Departments/Portuguese_Brazilian_Studies/ejph/pessoaplural/issues.html \"Imaginary poets in a real world\" in ''Pessoa Plural''] Issue 9, Spring 2016, p. 301.</ref>\n}}\nAs the fake heteronym Coelho Pacheco, over a long period Pessoa's \"triumphant day\" was taken as real, however, it has been proved that this event was one more fiction created by Pessoa.<ref>Castro, Ivo, \"O corpus de 'O Guardador de Rebanhos' depositado na Biblioteca Nacional\", Separata da ''Revista da Biblioteca Nacional'', vol. 2, n.\u00ba 1, 1982, pp. 47-61.</ref>\n\n==Heteronyms==\n[[File:Lisboa-Pessoa-A Brasileira-1.jpg|thumb|200px|Pessoa's statue outside Lisbon's famous coffeehouse \u00ab[[A Brasileira]]\u00bb.]]\n\nPessoa's earliest [[Heteronym (literature)|heteronym]], at the age of six, was '''Chevalier de Pas'''. Other childhood heteronyms included '''Dr. Pancr\u00e1cio''' and '''David Merrick''', followed by '''Charles Robert Anon''', an English young man that became Pessoa's ''[[alter ego]]''. In 1905/7, when Pessoa was a student at the [[University of Lisbon]], '''Alexander Search''' took the place of Anon. The main reason for this was that, although Search is English, he was born in Lisbon as his author. But Search represents a transition heteronym that Pessoa used while searching to adapt to the Portuguese cultural reality. After the republican revolution, in 1910, and consequent patriotic atmosphere, Pessoa created another ''alter ego'', '''[[\u00c1lvaro de Campos]]''', supposedly a Portuguese naval engineer, born in [[Tavira]] and graduated in [[Glasgow]]. Translator Richard Zenith notes that Pessoa eventually established at least seventy-two heteronyms.<ref>''The Book of Disquiet'', tr. Richard Zenith, Penguin classics, 2003.</ref> According to Pessoa himself, there were three main heteronyms: '''Alberto Caeiro''', '''\u00c1lvaro de Campos''' and '''Ricardo Reis'''. The heteronyms possess distinct biographies, temperaments, philosophies, appearances, writing styles and even signatures.<ref>Letter to Adolfo Casais Monteiro, 13 January 1935.</ref>\n\nPessoa wrote on the heteronyms:\n{{bquote |How do I write in the name of these three? Caeiro, through sheer and unexpected inspiration, without knowing or even suspecting that I\u2019m going to write in his name. Ricardo Reis, after an abstract meditation, which suddenly takes concrete shape in an ode. Campos, when I feel a sudden impulse to write and don\u2019t know what. (My semi-heteronym Bernardo Soares, who in many ways resembles \u00c1lvaro de Campos, always appears when I'm sleepy or drowsy, so that my qualities of inhibition and rational thought are suspended; his prose is an endless reverie. He\u2019s a semi-heteronym because his personality, although not my own, doesn\u2019t differ from my own but is a mere mutilation of it. He\u2019s me without my rationalism and emotions. His prose is the same as mine, except for certain formal restraint that reason imposes on my own writing, and his Portuguese is exactly the same \u2013 whereas Caeiro writes bad Portuguese, Campos writes it reasonably well but with mistakes such as \"me myself\" instead of \"I myself\", etc.., and Reis writes better than I, but with a purism I find excessive...).<ref>Fernando Pessoa, letter to Adolfo Casais Monteiro, 13 January 1935, transl. by Richard Zenith, in Pessoa, Fernando (2003), ''The Book of Disquiet'', tr.

He does not let any thoughts arise when he looks at a flower... the only thing a stone tells him is that it has nothing at all to tell him... this way of looking at a stone may be described as the totally unpoetic way of looking at it.

He does not question anything whatsoever; he calmly accepts the world as it is. The recurrent themes to be found in nearly all of Caeiro's poems are wide-eyed childlike wonder at the infinite variety of nature, as noted by a critic. He is free of [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] entanglements. Central to his world-view is the idea that in the world around us, all is surface: things are precisely what they seem, there is no hidden meaning anywhere.\n\nHe manages thus to free himself from the anxieties that batter his peers; for Caeiro, things simply exist and we have no right to credit them with more than that. Caeiro attains happiness by not questioning, and by thus avoiding doubts and uncertainties. He apprehends reality solely through his eyes, through his senses. [[Octavio Paz]] called him the innocent poet. Paz made a shrewd remark on the heteronyms: In each are particles of negation or unreality. Reis believes in form, Campos in sensation, Pessoa in symbols. Caeiro doesn't believe in anything. He exists.<ref>Paz, Octavio (1983), \"El Desconocido de Si Mismo: Fernando Pessoa\", in ''Los Signos en Rotacion y Otros Ensayos'', Madrid: Alianza Editorial.</ref>\n\nPoetry before Caeiro was essentially interpretative; what poets did was to offer an interpretation of their perceived surroundings; Caeiro does not do this. Instead, he attempts to communicate his senses, and his feelings, without any interpretation whatsoever.\n\nCaeiro attempts to approach Nature from a qualitatively different mode of apprehension; that of simply perceiving (an approach akin to [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] approaches to philosophy). Poets before him would make use of intricate metaphors to describe what was before them; not so Caeiro: his self-appointed task is to bring these objects to the reader's attention, as directly and simply as possible. Caeiro sought a direct experience of the objects before him.\n\nAs such it is not surprising to find that Caeiro has been called an anti-intellectual, anti-Romantic, anti-subjectivist, anti-metaphysical...an anti-poet, by critics; Caeiro simply\u2014is. He is in this sense very unlike his creator Fernando Pessoa: Pessoa was besieged by metaphysical uncertainties; these were, to a large extent, the cause of his unhappiness; not so Caeiro: his attitude is anti-metaphysical; he avoided uncertainties by adamantly clinging to a certainty: his belief that there is no meaning behind things. Things, for him, simply\u2014are.\n\nCaeiro represents a primal vision of reality, of things. He is the pagan incarnate. Indeed, Caeiro was not simply a pagan but paganism itself.<ref>Pessoa, Fernando, Notas Para Recorda\u00e7\u00e3o do Meu Mestre Caeiro ''in Presen\u00e7a'' nr. 30, Jan.-Feb. 1930, Coimbra.</ref>\n\nThe critic Jane M. Sheets sees the insurgence of Caeiro\u2014who was Pessoa's first major heteronym\u2014as essential in founding the later poetic ''personas'': By means of this artless yet affirmative anti-poet, Caeiro, a short-lived but vital member of his coterie, Pessoa acquired the base of an experienced and universal poetic vision. After Caeiro's tenets had been established, the avowedly poetic voices of Campos, Reis and Pessoa himself spoke with greater assurance.<ref>Sheets, Jane M., Fernando Pessoa as Anti-Poet: Alberto Caeiro, ''in Bulletin of Hispanic Studies'', Vol. XLVI, Nr. 1, January 1969, pp. 39\u201347.</ref>\n\n===Ricardo Reis===\n\n[[File:Athena_Revista_de_Arte N.1 Outubro 1924.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Athena \u2014 Art Journal'' (5 issues edited by Pessoa and Ruy Vaz in 1924-1925), published poetry by Pessoa, ''Ricardo Reis'', and ''Alberto Caeiro'', as well as essays by ''[[\u00c1lvaro de Campos]]''.]]\n\nIn a letter to William Bentley,<ref>This letter, to the director of the journal ''Portugal'', was written on 31 October 1924, to announce Pessoa's art journal ''Athena''.</ref>  Pessoa wrote that \"a ''knowledge'' of the language would be indispensable, for instance, to appraise the 'Odes' of Ricardo Reis, whose Portuguese would draw upon him the blessing of [[Ant\u00f3nio Vieira]], as his stile and diction that of [[Horace]] (he has been called, admirably I believe, 'a Greek Horace who writes in Portuguese')\".<ref>Pessoa, Fernando (1999), ''Correspond\u00eancia 1923\u20131935'', ed.

Never question it. There's nothing it can tell you.\" Like Caeiro, whom he admires, Reis defers from questioning life. He is a modern pagan who urges one to seize the day and accept fate with tranquility. \"Wise is the one who does not seek. The seeker will find in all things the abyss, and doubt in himself.\"{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} In this sense, Reis shares essential affinities with Caeiro.\n\nBelieving in the [[Greek mythology|Greek gods]], yet living in a Christian Europe, Reis feels that his spiritual life is limited and true happiness cannot be attained. This, added to his belief in Fate as a driving force for all that exists, as such disregarding freedom, leads to his [[epicureanism|epicureanist]] philosophy, which entails the avoidance of pain, defending that man should seek tranquility and calm above all else, avoiding emotional extremes.\n\nWhere Caeiro wrote freely and spontaneously, with joviality, of his basic, meaningless connection to the world, Reis writes in an austere, cerebral manner, with premeditated rhythm and structure and a particular attention to the correct use of the language when approaching his subjects of, as characterized by Richard Zenith, \"the brevity of life, the vanity of wealth and struggle, the joy of simple pleasures, patience in time of trouble, and avoidance of extremes\".\n\nIn his detached, intellectual approach, he is closer to Fernando Pessoa's constant rationalization, as such representing the orthonym's wish for measure and sobriety and a world free of troubles and respite, in stark contrast to Caeiro's spirit and style. As such, where Caeiro's predominant attitude is that of joviality, his sadness being accepted as natural (\"My sadness is a comfort for it is natural and right.\"), Reis is marked by melancholy, saddened by the impermanence of all things.\n\nRicardo Reis is the main character of [[Jos\u00e9 Saramago]]'s 1986 novel ''[[The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis]]''.\n\n===\u00c1lvaro de Campos===\n{{Main|\u00c1lvaro de Campos}}\n\n[[File:Portugal Futurista 1 1917.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Portugal Futurista'', the art journal that published ''Campos''' \"Ultimatum\" in 1917.]]\n\n[[\u00c1lvaro de Campos]] manifests, in a way, as a hyperbolic version of Pessoa himself. Of the three heteronyms he is the one who feels most strongly, his motto being 'to feel everything in every way.' 'The best way to travel,' he wrote, 'is to feel.' As such, his poetry is the most emotionally intense and varied, constantly juggling two fundamental impulses: on the one hand a feverish desire to be and feel everything and everyone, declaring that 'in every corner of my soul stands an altar to a different god' (alluding to [[Walt Whitman]]'s desire to 'contain multitudes'), on the other, a wish for a state of isolation and a sense of nothingness.\n\nAs a result, his mood and principles varied between violent, dynamic exultation, as he fervently wishes to experience the entirety of the universe in himself, in all manners possible (a particularly distinctive trait in this state being his [[Futurism (art)|futuristic]] leanings, including the expression of great enthusiasm as to the meaning of city life and its components) and a state of nostalgic melancholy, where life is viewed as, essentially, empty.\n\nOne of the poet's constant preoccupations, as part of his dichotomous character, is that of identity: he does not know who he is, or rather, fails at achieving an ideal identity. Wanting to be everything, and inevitably failing, he despairs. Unlike Caeiro, who asks nothing of life, he asks too much. In his poetic meditation 'Tobacco Shop' he asks:\n\n{{bquote|How should I know what I'll be, I who don't know what I am?<br>\nTo be what I think? But I think of being so many things!}}\n\n==Summaries of selected works==\n\n===''Message''===\n\n[[File:1edicao Mensagem 1934.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Mensagem'', first edition, 1934.]]\n\n''Mensagem'',<ref name=\"FPMessagemEdEF2016\">{{cite book |author-last= Pessoa |author-first= Fernando |editor-last= Freitas |editor-first= Eduardo |year=2016 |language= Portuguese \n|title= A Mensagem: Editado por Eduardo Filipe Freitas |website= amazon.com \n|location= |publisher= CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform\n|url= https://www.amazon.com/Mensagem-Editado-Eduardo-Freitas-Portuguese/dp/1535199091/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1473508471&sr=8-2&keywords=eduardo+filipe+freitas\n|isbn= 978-1-535-19909-4}}</ref> written in Portuguese, is a symbolist epic made up of 44 short poems organized in three parts or Cycles:<ref>''Message'', Tr. by [[Jonathan Griffin]], Exeter: Shearsman Books, 2007.</ref>\n\nThe first, called \"Bras\u00e3o\" (Coat-of-Arms), relates Portuguese historical protagonists to each of the fields and charges in the [[Coat of arms of Portugal|Portuguese coat of arms]]. The first two poems (\"The castles\" and \"The escutcheons\") draw inspiration from the material and spiritual natures of Portugal. Each of the remaining poems associates to each charge a historical personality. Ultimately they all lead to the [[Portuguese discoveries|Golden Age of Discovery]].\n\nThe second Part, called \"Mar Portugu\u00eas\" (Portuguese Sea), references the country's Age of Portuguese Exploration and to [[Portuguese Empire|its seaborne Empire]] that ended with the death of [[Sebastian of Portugal|King Sebastian]] at [[Ksar el-Kebir|El-Ksar el Kebir]] (''Alc\u00e1cer-Quibir'' in Portuguese) in 1578. Pessoa brings the reader to the present as if he had woken up from a dream of the past, to fall in a dream of the future: he sees King Sebastian returning and still bent on accomplishing a Universal Empire.\n\nThe third Cycle, called \"O Encoberto\" (\"The Hidden One\"), refers to Pessoa's vision of a future world of peace and the [[Fifth Empire]] (which, according to Pessoa, is spiritual and not material, because if it were material England would already have achieved it). After the Age of Force, (Vis), and Taedium (Otium) will come Science (understanding) through a reawakening of \"The Hidden One\", or \"King Sebastian\". The Hidden One represents the fulfillment of the destiny of mankind, designed by God since before Time, and the accomplishment of Portugal.\n\nKing Sebastian is very important, indeed he appears in all three parts of Mensagem. He represents the capacity of dreaming, and believing that it's possible to achieve dreams.\n\nOne of the most famous quotes from ''Mensagem'' is the first line from ''O Infante'' (belonging to the second Part), which is ''Deus quer, o homem sonha, a obra nasce'' (which translates roughly to \"God wishes, man dreams, the work is born\"). Another well-known quote from ''Mensagem'' is the first line from ''Ulysses'', \"O mito \u00e9 o nada que \u00e9 tudo\" (a possible translation is \"The myth is the nothing that is all\"). This poem refers to  [[Odysseus|Ulysses]], king of [[Ithaca]], as Lisbon's founder (recalling an ancient Greek myth).<ref>\n[http://purl.pt/13966/2/ ''Mensagem''] 1st. edition, 1934, at the Portuguese National Library.</ref>\n\n===Literary essays===\n\n[[File:A Aguia.JPG|thumb|right|200px|''A \u00c1guia \u2014 Organ of the Portuguese Renaissance'' \u2014 issue nr. 4, April 1912.]]\n\nIn 1912, Fernando Pessoa wrote a set of essays (later collected as ''The New Portuguese Poetry'') for the cultural journal ''A \u00c1guia'' (The Eagle), founded in [[Porto|Oporto]], in December 1910, and run by the republican association Renascen\u00e7a Portuguesa.<ref>Martins, Fernando Cabral (coord.) (2008). ''Dicion\u00e1rio de Fernando Pessoa e do Modernismo Portugu\u00eas''. Alfragide: Editorial Caminho.</ref> In the first years of the [[Portuguese Republic]], this cultural association was started by republican intellectuals led by the writer and poet [[Teixeira de Pascoaes]], philosopher Leonardo Coimbra and historian Jaime Cortes\u00e3o, aiming for the renewal of Portuguese culture through the aesthetic movement called Saudosismo.<ref>The Portuguese Republic was founded by the revolution of 5 October 1910, giving freedom of association and publishing.</ref> Pessoa contributed to the journal ''A \u00c1guia'' with a series of papers: 'The new Portuguese Poetry Sociologically Considered' (nr. 4), 'Relapsing...' (nr. 5) and 'The Psychological Aspect of the new Portuguese Poetry' (nrs. 9,11 and 12). These writings were strongly encomiastic to saudosist literature, namely the poetry of [[Teixeira de Pascoaes]] and [[M\u00e1rio Beir\u00e3o]]. The articles disclose Pessoa as a connoisseur of modern European literature and an expert of recent literary trends. On the other hand, he does not care much for a methodology of analysis or problems in the history of ideas. He states his confidence that Portugal would soon produce a great poet \u2013 a super-[[Cam\u00f5es]] \u2013 pledged to make an important contribution for European culture, and indeed, for humanity.<ref>Pessoa, Fernando (1993).

Lisboa: Edi\u00e7\u00f5es \u00c1tica.</ref>\n\n===Philosophical essays===\nThe philosophical notes of the young Pessoa, mostly written between 1905 and 1912, illustrate his debt to the history of [[Philosophy]] more through commentators than through a first-hand protracted reading of the Classics, ancient or modern.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} The issues he engages with pertain to every philosophical discipline and concern a large profusion of concepts, creating a vast semantic spectrum in texts whose length varies between half a dozen lines and half a dozen pages and whose density of analysis is extremely variable; simple paraphrasis, expression of assumptions and original speculation.\n\nPessoa sorted the philosophical systems thus:\n\n[[File:A Mensagem. Fernando Pessoa.jpg|thumb|300px|A passage from his famous poem \"Mar Portugu\u00eas\" from ''Message'', in the city of [[Lagos, Portugal]].]]\n\n# Relative Spiritualism and relative Materialism privilege \"Spirit\" or \"Matter\" as the main pole that organizes data around Experience.\n# Absolute Spiritualist and Absolute Materialist \"deny all objective reality to one of the elements of Experience\".\n# The materialistic [[Pantheism]] of [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] and the spiritualizing Pantheism of [[Nicolas Malebranche|Malebranche]], \"admit that experience is a double manifestation of any thing that in its essence has no matter neither spirit\".\n# Considering both elements as an \"illusory manifestation\", of a transcendent and true and alone realities, there is [[Transcendentalism]], inclined into matter with [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], or into spirit, a position where [[Henri Bergson|Bergson]] could be emplaced.\n# A terminal system \"the limited and summit of metaphysics\" would not radicalize \u2013 as poles of experience \u2013 one of the single categories: matter, relative, absolute, real, illusory, spirit. Instead, matching all categories, it takes contradiction as \"the essence of the universe\" and defends that \"an affirmation is so more true insofar the more contradiction involves\". The transcendent must be conceived beyond categories. There ''is one only and eternal example of it. It is that cathedral of thought -the philosophy of [[Hegel]].''\nSuch [[pantheist]] [[transcendentalism]] is used by Pessoa to define the project that \"encompasses and exceeds all systems\"; to characterize the new poetry of '''Saudosismo''' where the \"typical contradiction of this system\" occurs; to inquire of the particular social and political results of its adoption as the leading cultural paradigm; and, at last, he hints that metaphysics and religiosity strive \"to find in everything a beyond\".\n\n==Works==\n* {{citation | title = Hist\u00f3rias de um Raciocinador e o ensaio \"Hist\u00f3ria Policial\" (Tales of a Reasoner and the essay \"Detective Story\") bilingual edition, translated from the original writings in English | others = Ana Maria Freitas, edit & transl | place = Lisbon, Portugal | publisher = Ass\u00edrio & Alvim | year = 2012 | isbn = 978-972-0-79312-6 | url = http://www.assirio.pt/livros/ficha/historias-de-um-raciocinador-e-o-ensaio-historia-policial-?id=13029621 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130114073700/http://www.assirio.pt/livros/ficha/historias-de-um-raciocinador-e-o-ensaio-historia-policial-?id=13029621 | archivedate = 14 January 2013 | df = dmy-all }}\n* {{citation | title = Forever Someone Else \u2013 selected poems \u2013 2nd edition (enlarged) | origyear = 2008 | others = Richard Zenith, transl | place = Lisbon, Portugal | publisher = Ass\u00edrio & Alvim | year = 2010 | isbn = 978-972-37-1379-4 | url = http://www.assirio.pt/livros/ficha/forever-someone-else?id=11237521 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130114073341/http://www.assirio.pt/livros/ficha/forever-someone-else?id=11237521 | archivedate = 14 January 2013 | df = dmy-all }}\n* {{citation | title = Collected Poems of \u00c1lvaro de Campos | origyear = 1928\u201335 | others = Chris Daniels, transl | place = Exeter, UK | publisher = Shearsman Books | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-1-905700-25-7 | url = http://www.shearsman.com/pages/books/catalog/2009/pessoa_campos.html | access-date = 28 July 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101218061805/http://www.shearsman.com/pages/books/catalog/2009/pessoa_campos.html | archive-date = 18 December 2010 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}\n* {{citation | title = Lisbon: What the Tourist Should See | place = Exeter, UK | publisher = Shearsman Books | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-1-905700-25-7 | url = http://www.shearsman.com/pages/books/catalog/2008/pessoa_lisbon.html | access-date = 28 July 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110402025713/http://www.shearsman.com/pages/books/catalog/2008/pessoa_lisbon.html | archive-date = 2 April 2011 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}\n* {{citation | title = The Collected Poems of Alberto Caeiro | others = Chris Daniels, transl | place = Exeter, UK | publisher = Shearsman Books | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-1-905700-24-0 | url = http://www.shearsman.com/pages/books/catalog/2007/pessoa_caeiro.html | access-date = 28 July 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110404053758/http://www.shearsman.com/pages/books/catalog/2007/pessoa_caeiro.html | archive-date = 4 April 2011 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}\n* {{citation | title = Selected English Poems | place = Exeter, UK | publisher = Shearsman Books | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-1-905700-26-4 | url = http://www.shearsman.com/pages/books/catalog/2007/pessoa_engl.html | access-date = 28 July 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110402024401/http://www.shearsman.com/pages/books/catalog/2007/pessoa_engl.html | archive-date = 2 April 2011 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}\n* {{citation | title = Message | others = Jonathan Griffin, transl | place = Exeter, UK | publisher = Shearsman Books | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-1-905700-27-1 | url = http://www.shearsman.com/pages/books/catalog/2007/pessoa_msg.html | access-date = 28 July 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110402022853/http://www.shearsman.com/pages/books/catalog/2007/pessoa_msg.html | archive-date = 2 April 2011 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}\n* ''Selected English Poems '', ed.

translator, publisher and philosopher, described as one of the most significant literary figures of the 20th century and one of the greatest poets in the [[Portuguese language]]. He also wrote in and translated from English and French.\n\nPessoa was a prolific writer, and not only under his own name, for he created approximately seventy-five others. He did not call them all ''pseudonyms'' because he felt that some did not capture their true independent intellectual life and instead called them [[Heteronym (literature)|''heteronyms'']]. These imaginary figures sometimes held unpopular or extreme views.\n\n== English education ==\n\n[[File:Fernando Pessoa Largo de S\u00e3o Carlos2035.JPG|thumb|200px|Pessoa's birthplace: a large flat at S\u00e3o Carlos Square, just in front of Lisbon's opera.]]\nPessoa was born in [[Lisbon]] on 13 June 1888. When Pessoa was five, his father, Joaquim de Seabra Pess\u00f4a, died of [[tuberculosis]] and the following year, on 2 January, his younger brother Jorge, aged one, also died.\n\nAfter the second marriage of his mother, Maria Magdalena Pinheiro Nogueira, proxy wedding to Jo\u00e3o Miguel dos Santos Rosa, Fernando sailed with his mother for South Africa in the beginning of 1896, to join his stepfather, a military officer appointed Portuguese [[Consul (representative)|consul]] in [[Durban]], capital of the former British [[Colony of Natal]]. Later on, in 1918, Pessoa wrote a letter in which refers:\n\n[[File:FP triciclo.jpg|thumb|200px| Last year in Lisbon before moving to Durban, 1894, aged 6.]]\n\n{{bquote \n|There is only one event in the past which has both the definiteness and the importance required for rectification by direction; this is my father's death, which took place on 13 July 1893. My mother's second marriage (which took place on 30 December 1895) is another date which I can give with preciseness and it is important for me, not in itself, but in one of its results \u2013 the circumstance that, my stepfather becoming Portuguese Consul in Durban (Natal), I was educated there, this English education being a factor of supreme importance in my life, and, whatever my fate be, indubitably shaping it.\nThe dates of the voyages related to the above event are (as nearly as possible):\n\n1st. voyage to Africa \u2013 left Lisbon beginning January 1896.\n\nReturn \u2013 left Durban in the afternoon of 1st. August 1901.\n\n2nd. voyage to Africa \u2013 left Lisbon about 20th. September 1902.\n\nReturn \u2013 left Durban about 20th. August 1905.<ref>Letter to ''British Journal of Astrology'', W.

He moved to the [[Durban High School]] in April 1899, becoming fluent in English and developing an appreciation for English literature. During the [[Matriculation examination|Matriculation Examination]], held at the time by the University of the Cape of Good Hope (forerunner of the [[University of Cape Town]]), in November 1903, he was awarded the recently created [[Queen Victoria]] Memorial Prize for best paper in English. While preparing to enter university, he also attended the Durban Commercial High School during one year, taking night classes.\n\n[[File:Pessoa 1898.jpg|thumb|200px|Pessoa in Durban, 1898, aged 10.]]\n\nMeanwhile, Pessoa started writing short stories in English, some under the name of David Merrick, many of which he left unfinished.<ref name = \"Zenith, Richard 2008\">Zenith, Richard (2008), ''Fotobiografias S\u00e9culo XX: Fernando Pessoa'', Lisboa: C\u00edrculo de Leitores.</ref> At the age of sixteen, ''[[The Natal Mercury]]''<ref>[http://www.themercury.co.za/ ''The Natal Mercury'']</ref> (edition of 6 July 1904) published his poem \"Hillier did first usurp the realms of rhyme...\", under the name of C. R. Anon (anonymous), along with a brief introductory text: \"I read with great amusement...\". In December, ''The Durban High School Magazine'' published his essay \"Macaulay\".<ref>Monteiro, Maria da Encarna\u00e7\u00e3o (1961), ''Incid\u00eancias Inglesas na Poesia de Fernando Pessoa, Coimbra:  author ed.''</ref> From February to June 1905, in the section \"The Man in the Moon\", ''The Natal Mercury'' also published at least four sonnets by Fernando Pessoa: \"Joseph Chamberlain\", \"To England I\", \"To England II\" and \"Liberty\".<ref>Jennings, H. D. (1984), ''Os Dois Exilios'', Porto: Centro de Estudos Pessoanos</ref> His poems often carried humorous versions of [[Anonymity|Anon]] as the author's name. Pessoa started using [[pen names]] quite young. The first one, still in his childhood, was Chevalier de Pas, supposedly a French noble. In addition to Charles Robert Anon and David Merrick, the young writer also signed up, among other pen names, as Horace James Faber, Alexander Search, and other meaningful names.\n\nIn the preface to ''The Book of Disquiet'', Pessoa wrote about himself:\n\n{{bquote|Nothing had ever obliged him to do anything. He had spent his childhood alone. He never joined any group. He never pursued a course of study. He never belonged to a crowd. The circumstances of his life were marked by that strange but rather common phenomenon \u2013 perhaps, in fact, it\u2019s true for all lives \u2013 of being tailored to the image and likeness of his instincts, which tended towards inertia and withdrawal.}}\n\n[[File:Pessoa13.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Pessoa in 1901, aged 13.]]\nThe young Pessoa was described by a schoolfellow as follows:\n{{bquote |I cannot tell you exactly how long I knew him, but the period during which I received most of my impressions of him was the whole of the year 1904 when we were at school together. How old he was at this time I don\u2019t know, but judge him to have 15 or 16. [...]\n\nHe was pale and thin and appeared physically to be very imperfectly developed. He had a narrow and contracted chest and was inclined to stoop. He had a peculiar walk and some defect in his eyesight gave to his eyes also a peculiar appearance, the lids seemed to drop over the eyes. [...]\n\nHe was regarded as a brilliant clever boy as, in spite of the fact that he had not spoken English in his early years, he had learned it so rapidly and so well that he had a splendid style in that language. Although younger than his schoolfellows of the same class he appeared to have no difficulty in keeping up with and surpassing them in work. For one of his age, he thought much and deeply and in a letter to me once complained of \"spiritual and material encumbrances of most especial adverseness\". [...]\n\nHe took no part in athletic sports of any kind and I think his spare time was spent on reading. We generally considered that he worked far too much and that he would ruin his health by so doing.<ref>Clifford E. Geerdts, letter to ''Dr. Faustino Antunes'', 10 April 1907. In Pessoa, Fernando (2003). ''Escritos Autobiogr\u00e1ficos, Autom\u00e1ticos e de Reflex\u00e3o Pessoal'', ed. Richard Zenith. Lisboa: Ass\u00edrio & Alvim, pp. 394\u2013398.</ref>}}\n\nTen years after his arrival, he sailed for [[Lisbon]] via the [[Suez Canal]] on board the \"Herzog\", leaving Durban for good at the age of seventeen. This journey inspired the poems \"Opi\u00e1rio\" (dedicated to his friend, the poet and writer [[M\u00e1rio de S\u00e1-Carneiro]]) published in March 1915, in ''[[Gera\u00e7\u00e3o de Orpheu|Orpheu]]'' nr.1<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/23620 ''Orpheu'' nr.1]</ref> and \"Ode Mar\u00edtima\" (dedicated to the futurist painter [[Guilherme de Santa-Rita|Santa-Rita]]) published in June 1915, in ''Orpheu'' nr.2<ref>{{citation | publisher = [[Project Gutenberg]] | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/23621 | title = Orpheu | issue = 2}}.</ref> by his [[heteronym (literature)|heteronym]] [[\u00c1lvaro de Campos]].\n\n==Lisbon revisited==\n\n[[File:Papel timbrado da Empresa Ibis 1.jpg|thumb|200px|\"Ibis Enterprise\", the first firm established by Pessoa, in 1909.]]\n\nWhile his family remained in South Africa, Pessoa returned to Lisbon in 1905 to study diplomacy. After a period of illness, and two years of poor results, a [[student strike]] against the dictatorship of Prime Minister [[Jo\u00e3o Franco]] put an end to his formal studies. Pessoa became an autodidact, a devoted reader who spent a lot of time at the library. In August 1907, he started working as a practitioner at  R.G. Dun & Company, an American mercantile information agency (currently D&B, Dun & Bradstreet). His grandmother died in September and left him a small inheritance, which he spent on setting up his own publishing house, the \"Empreza Ibis\". The venture was not successful and closed down in 1910, but the name [[ibis]],<ref>Ibe name \"ibis\" has a very long literary tradition: the elegiac poem ''Ibis'' by [[Ovid]] was inspired in the lost poem of the same title by [[Callimachus]].</ref> the sacred bird of [[Ancient Egypt]] and inventor of the alphabet in [[Greek mythology]], would remain an important symbolic reference for him.\n\nPessoa returned to his uncompleted formal studies, complementing his British education with self-directed study of Portuguese culture. The pre-revolutionary atmosphere surrounding the assassination of King [[Carlos I of Portugal|Charles I]] and Crown Prince [[Lu\u00eds Filipe, Prince Royal of Portugal|Lu\u00eds Filipe]] in 1908, and the patriotic outburst resulting from the successful [[5 October 1910 revolution|republican revolution]] in 1910, influenced the development of the budding writer; as did his step-uncle, Henrique dos Santos Rosa, a poet and retired soldier, who introduced the young Pessoa to Portuguese poetry, notably the romantics and symbolists of the 19th century.<ref>{{citation | language = Portuguese | last = Zenith | first = Richard | year = 2008 | series = Fotobiografias do S\u00e9culo XX | title = Fernando Pessoa | place = Lisboa | publisher = C\u00edrculo de Leitores | page = 78}}.</ref>  In 1912, Fernando Pessoa entered the literary world with a critical essay, published in the cultural journal ''A \u00c1guia'', which triggered one of the most important literary debates in the Portuguese intellectual world of the 20th century: the polemic regarding a super-[[Cam\u00f5es]]. In 1915 a group of artists and poets, including Fernando Pessoa, [[M\u00e1rio de S\u00e1-Carneiro]] and [[Almada Negreiros]], created the literary magazine ''[[Gera\u00e7\u00e3o de Orpheu|Orpheu]]'',<ref>{{citation | url = http://purl.pt/12089/2/ | language = Portuguese | title = Orpheu | editor-first = Ant\u00f3nio | editor-last = Ferro | place = Lisboa | date = Jan\u2013Mar 1915 | publisher = Orpheu, Lda. | issue = 1\u20132}}.</ref> which introduced [[modernist]] literature to Portugal. Only two issues were published (Jan\u2013Feb\u2013Mar and Apr\u2013May\u2013Jun 1915), the third failed to appear due to funding difficulties.

He felt \"more curiosity than fear\", but was respectful towards this phenomenon and asked secrecy, because \"there is no advantage, but many disadvantages\" in speaking about this.

In 1915, he created the heteronym ''Raphael Baldaya'', an astrologist who planned to write \"System of Astrology\" and \"Introduction to the Study of Occultism\". Pessoa established the pricing of his astrological services from 500 to 5,000 [[Portuguese real|r\u00e9is]] and made horoscopes of customers, friends and also himself and, astonishingly, of the heteronyms and also of journals as ''Orpheu''.\n\nBorn on 13 June, Pessoa was native of Gemini and had Scorpio as rising sign. The characters of the main heteronyms were inspired by the four astral elements: air, fire, water and earth. It means that Pessoa and his heteronyms altogether comprised the full principles of ancient knowledge. Those heteronyms were designed according to their [[horoscope]]s, all including [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], the planet of literature. Astrology was part of his everyday life and Pessoa kept that interest until his death, which he was able to predict with some accuracy.<ref>{{citation | last = Cardoso | first = Paulo | year = 2011 | title = Fernando Pessoa, cartas astrol\u00f3gicas | place = Lisbon | publisher = Bertrand editora | isbn = 978-972-25-2261-8}}.</ref>\n\n[[File: FP_last_writing.jpg|thumb|300px|Pessoa's last writing: 29-11-1935 <br/>\"''I know not what tomorrow will bring''\". <br/> He died next day, 30 November 1935.]]\n\nAs a [[mysticist]], Pessoa was an enthusiast of [[esotericism]], [[occultism]], [[hermetism]], [[numerology]] and [[alchemy]]. Along with spiritualism and astrology, he also paid attention to [[neopaganism]], [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|theosophy]], [[rosicrucianism]] and [[freemasonry]], which strongly influenced his literary work.

I wrote thirty some poems in a row, all in a kind of ecstasy, the nature of which I shall never fathom. It was the triumphant day of my life, and I shall never have another like it. I began with a title, The Keeper of Sheep. And what followed was the appearance of someone within me to whom I promptly assigned the name of Alberto Caeiro. Please excuse the absurdity of what I am about to say, but there had appeared within me, then and there, my own master. It was my immediate sensation. So much so that, with those thirty odd poems written, I immediately took up another sheet of paper and wrote as well, in a row, the six poems that make up \"Oblique Rain\" by Fernando Pessoa. Immediately and totally... It was the return from Fernando Pessoa/Alberto Caeiro to Fernando Pessoa alone. Or better still, it was Fernando Pessoa\u2019s reaction to his own inexistence as Alberto Caeiro.<ref>Fernando Pessoa, letter to Adolfo Casais Monteiro, 13 January 1935, transl. by George Monteiro,[https://www.brown.edu/Departments/Portuguese_Brazilian_Studies/ejph/pessoaplural/issues.html \"Imaginary poets in a real world\" in ''Pessoa Plural''] Issue 9, Spring 2016, p. 301.</ref>\n}}\nAs the fake heteronym Coelho Pacheco, over a long period Pessoa's \"triumphant day\" was taken as real, however, it has been proved that this event was one more fiction created by Pessoa.<ref>Castro, Ivo, \"O corpus de 'O Guardador de Rebanhos' depositado na Biblioteca Nacional\", Separata da ''Revista da Biblioteca Nacional'', vol. 2, n.\u00ba 1, 1982, pp. 47-61.</ref>\n\n==Heteronyms==\n[[File:Lisboa-Pessoa-A Brasileira-1.jpg|thumb|200px|Pessoa's statue outside Lisbon's famous coffeehouse \u00ab[[A Brasileira]]\u00bb.]]\n\nPessoa's earliest [[Heteronym (literature)|heteronym]], at the age of six, was '''Chevalier de Pas'''. Other childhood heteronyms included '''Dr. Pancr\u00e1cio''' and '''David Merrick''', followed by '''Charles Robert Anon''', an English young man that became Pessoa's ''[[alter ego]]''. In 1905/7, when Pessoa was a student at the [[University of Lisbon]], '''Alexander Search''' took the place of Anon. The main reason for this was that, although Search is English, he was born in Lisbon as his author. But Search represents a transition heteronym that Pessoa used while searching to adapt to the Portuguese cultural reality. After the republican revolution, in 1910, and consequent patriotic atmosphere, Pessoa created another ''alter ego'', '''[[\u00c1lvaro de Campos]]''', supposedly a Portuguese naval engineer, born in [[Tavira]] and graduated in [[Glasgow]]. Translator Richard Zenith notes that Pessoa eventually established at least seventy-two heteronyms.<ref>''The Book of Disquiet'', tr. Richard Zenith, Penguin classics, 2003.</ref> According to Pessoa himself, there were three main heteronyms: '''Alberto Caeiro''', '''\u00c1lvaro de Campos''' and '''Ricardo Reis'''. The heteronyms possess distinct biographies, temperaments, philosophies, appearances, writing styles and even signatures.<ref>Letter to Adolfo Casais Monteiro, 13 January 1935.</ref>\n\nPessoa wrote on the heteronyms:\n{{bquote |How do I write in the name of these three? Caeiro, through sheer and unexpected inspiration, without knowing or even suspecting that I\u2019m going to write in his name. Ricardo Reis, after an abstract meditation, which suddenly takes concrete shape in an ode. Campos, when I feel a sudden impulse to write and don\u2019t know what. (My semi-heteronym Bernardo Soares, who in many ways resembles \u00c1lvaro de Campos, always appears when I'm sleepy or drowsy, so that my qualities of inhibition and rational thought are suspended; his prose is an endless reverie. He\u2019s a semi-heteronym because his personality, although not my own, doesn\u2019t differ from my own but is a mere mutilation of it. He\u2019s me without my rationalism and emotions. His prose is the same as mine, except for certain formal restraint that reason imposes on my own writing, and his Portuguese is exactly the same \u2013 whereas Caeiro writes bad Portuguese, Campos writes it reasonably well but with mistakes such as \"me myself\" instead of \"I myself\", etc.., and Reis writes better than I, but with a purism I find excessive...).<ref>Fernando Pessoa, letter to Adolfo Casais Monteiro, 13 January 1935, transl. by Richard Zenith, in Pessoa, Fernando (2003), ''The Book of Disquiet'', tr.

He does not let any thoughts arise when he looks at a flower... the only thing a stone tells him is that it has nothing at all to tell him... this way of looking at a stone may be described as the totally unpoetic way of looking at it. The stupendous fact about Caeiro is that out of this sentiment, or rather, absence of sentiment, he makes poetry.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=Fernando Pessoa & Co. : selected poems|last=Pessoa|first=Fernando |date=1998|publisher=Grove Press|last2=Zenith |first2=Richard |isbn=0802116280|edition=1st |location=New York|page=|pages=40|oclc=38055974}}</ref>\n\nWhat this means, and what makes Caeiro such an original poet is the way he apprehends existence. He does not question anything whatsoever; he calmly accepts the world as it is. The recurrent themes to be found in nearly all of Caeiro's poems are wide-eyed childlike wonder at the infinite variety of nature, as noted by a critic. He is free of [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] entanglements. Central to his world-view is the idea that in the world around us, all is surface: things are precisely what they seem, there is no hidden meaning anywhere.\n\nHe manages thus to free himself from the anxieties that batter his peers; for Caeiro, things simply exist and we have no right to credit them with more than that. Caeiro attains happiness by not questioning, and by thus avoiding doubts and uncertainties. He apprehends reality solely through his eyes, through his senses. [[Octavio Paz]] called him the innocent poet. Paz made a shrewd remark on the heteronyms: In each are particles of negation or unreality. Reis believes in form, Campos in sensation, Pessoa in symbols. Caeiro doesn't believe in anything. He exists.<ref>Paz, Octavio (1983), \"El Desconocido de Si Mismo: Fernando Pessoa\", in ''Los Signos en Rotacion y Otros Ensayos'', Madrid: Alianza Editorial.</ref>\n\nPoetry before Caeiro was essentially interpretative; what poets did was to offer an interpretation of their perceived surroundings; Caeiro does not do this. Instead, he attempts to communicate his senses, and his feelings, without any interpretation whatsoever.\n\nCaeiro attempts to approach Nature from a qualitatively different mode of apprehension; that of simply perceiving (an approach akin to [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] approaches to philosophy). Poets before him would make use of intricate metaphors to describe what was before them; not so Caeiro: his self-appointed task is to bring these objects to the reader's attention, as directly and simply as possible. Caeiro sought a direct experience of the objects before him.\n\nAs such it is not surprising to find that Caeiro has been called an anti-intellectual, anti-Romantic, anti-subjectivist, anti-metaphysical...an anti-poet, by critics; Caeiro simply\u2014is. He is in this sense very unlike his creator Fernando Pessoa: Pessoa was besieged by metaphysical uncertainties; these were, to a large extent, the cause of his unhappiness; not so Caeiro: his attitude is anti-metaphysical; he avoided uncertainties by adamantly clinging to a certainty: his belief that there is no meaning behind things. Things, for him, simply\u2014are.\n\nCaeiro represents a primal vision of reality, of things. He is the pagan incarnate.

Sheets sees the insurgence of Caeiro\u2014who was Pessoa's first major heteronym\u2014as essential in founding the later poetic ''personas'': By means of this artless yet affirmative anti-poet, Caeiro, a short-lived but vital member of his coterie, Pessoa acquired the base of an experienced and universal poetic vision. After Caeiro's tenets had been established, the avowedly poetic voices of Campos, Reis and Pessoa himself spoke with greater assurance.<ref>Sheets, Jane M., Fernando Pessoa as Anti-Poet: Alberto Caeiro, ''in Bulletin of Hispanic Studies'', Vol. XLVI, Nr. 1, January 1969, pp. 39\u201347.</ref>\n\n===Ricardo Reis===\n\n[[File:Athena_Revista_de_Arte N.1 Outubro 1924.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Athena \u2014 Art Journal'' (5 issues edited by Pessoa and Ruy Vaz in 1924-1925), published poetry by Pessoa, ''Ricardo Reis'', and ''Alberto Caeiro'', as well as essays by ''[[\u00c1lvaro de Campos]]''.]]\n\nIn a letter to William Bentley,<ref>This letter, to the director of the journal ''Portugal'', was written on 31 October 1924, to announce Pessoa's art journal ''Athena''.</ref>  Pessoa wrote that \"a ''knowledge'' of the language would be indispensable, for instance, to appraise the 'Odes' of Ricardo Reis, whose Portuguese would draw upon him the blessing of [[Ant\u00f3nio Vieira]], as his stile and diction that of [[Horace]] (he has been called, admirably I believe, 'a Greek Horace who writes in Portuguese')\".<ref>Pessoa, Fernando (1999), ''Correspond\u00eancia 1923\u20131935'', ed.

Never question it. There's nothing it can tell you.\" Like Caeiro, whom he admires, Reis defers from questioning life. He is a modern pagan who urges one to seize the day and accept fate with tranquility. \"Wise is the one who does not seek. The seeker will find in all things the abyss, and doubt in himself.\"{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} In this sense, Reis shares essential affinities with Caeiro.\n\nBelieving in the [[Greek mythology|Greek gods]], yet living in a Christian Europe, Reis feels that his spiritual life is limited and true happiness cannot be attained. This, added to his belief in Fate as a driving force for all that exists, as such disregarding freedom, leads to his [[epicureanism|epicureanist]] philosophy, which entails the avoidance of pain, defending that man should seek tranquility and calm above all else, avoiding emotional extremes.\n\nWhere Caeiro wrote freely and spontaneously, with joviality, of his basic, meaningless connection to the world, Reis writes in an austere, cerebral manner, with premeditated rhythm and structure and a particular attention to the correct use of the language when approaching his subjects of, as characterized by Richard Zenith, \"the brevity of life, the vanity of wealth and struggle, the joy of simple pleasures, patience in time of trouble, and avoidance of extremes\".\n\nIn his detached, intellectual approach, he is closer to Fernando Pessoa's constant rationalization, as such representing the orthonym's wish for measure and sobriety and a world free of troubles and respite, in stark contrast to Caeiro's spirit and style. As such, where Caeiro's predominant attitude is that of joviality, his sadness being accepted as natural (\"My sadness is a comfort for it is natural and right.\"), Reis is marked by melancholy, saddened by the impermanence of all things.\n\nRicardo Reis is the main character of [[Jos\u00e9 Saramago]]'s 1986 novel ''[[The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis]]''.\n\n===\u00c1lvaro de Campos===\n{{Main|\u00c1lvaro de Campos}}\n\n[[File:Portugal Futurista 1 1917.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Portugal Futurista'', the art journal that published ''Campos''' \"Ultimatum\" in 1917.]]\n\n[[\u00c1lvaro de Campos]] manifests, in a way, as a hyperbolic version of Pessoa himself. Of the three heteronyms he is the one who feels most strongly, his motto being 'to feel everything in every way.' 'The best way to travel,' he wrote, 'is to feel.' As such, his poetry is the most emotionally intense and varied, constantly juggling two fundamental impulses: on the one hand a feverish desire to be and feel everything and everyone, declaring that 'in every corner of my soul stands an altar to a different god' (alluding to [[Walt Whitman]]'s desire to 'contain multitudes'), on the other, a wish for a state of isolation and a sense of nothingness.\n\nAs a result, his mood and principles varied between violent, dynamic exultation, as he fervently wishes to experience the entirety of the universe in himself, in all manners possible (a particularly distinctive trait in this state being his [[Futurism (art)|futuristic]] leanings, including the expression of great enthusiasm as to the meaning of city life and its components) and a state of nostalgic melancholy, where life is viewed as, essentially, empty.\n\nOne of the poet's constant preoccupations, as part of his dichotomous character, is that of identity: he does not know who he is, or rather, fails at achieving an ideal identity. Wanting to be everything, and inevitably failing, he despairs. Unlike Caeiro, who asks nothing of life, he asks too much. In his poetic meditation 'Tobacco Shop' he asks:\n\n{{bquote|How should I know what I'll be, I who don't know what I am?<br>\nTo be what I think? But I think of being so many things!}}\n\n==Summaries of selected works==\n\n===''Message''===\n\n[[File:1edicao Mensagem 1934.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Mensagem'', first edition, 1934.]]\n\n''Mensagem'',<ref name=\"FPMessagemEdEF2016\">{{cite book |author-last= Pessoa |author-first= Fernando |editor-last= Freitas |editor-first= Eduardo |year=2016 |language= Portuguese \n|title= A Mensagem: Editado por Eduardo Filipe Freitas |website= amazon.com \n|location= |publisher= CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform\n|url= https://www.amazon.com/Mensagem-Editado-Eduardo-Freitas-Portuguese/dp/1535199091/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1473508471&sr=8-2&keywords=eduardo+filipe+freitas\n|isbn= 978-1-535-19909-4}}</ref> written in Portuguese, is a symbolist epic made up of 44 short poems organized in three parts or Cycles:<ref>''Message'', Tr. by [[Jonathan Griffin]], Exeter: Shearsman Books, 2007.</ref>\n\nThe first, called \"Bras\u00e3o\" (Coat-of-Arms), relates Portuguese historical protagonists to each of the fields and charges in the [[Coat of arms of Portugal|Portuguese coat of arms]]. The first two poems (\"The castles\" and \"The escutcheons\") draw inspiration from the material and spiritual natures of Portugal. Each of the remaining poems associates to each charge a historical personality. Ultimately they all lead to the [[Portuguese discoveries|Golden Age of Discovery]].\n\nThe second Part, called \"Mar Portugu\u00eas\" (Portuguese Sea), references the country's Age of Portuguese Exploration and to [[Portuguese Empire|its seaborne Empire]] that ended with the death of [[Sebastian of Portugal|King Sebastian]] at [[Ksar el-Kebir|El-Ksar el Kebir]] (''Alc\u00e1cer-Quibir'' in Portuguese) in 1578. Pessoa brings the reader to the present as if he had woken up from a dream of the past, to fall in a dream of the future: he sees King Sebastian returning and still bent on accomplishing a Universal Empire.\n\nThe third Cycle, called \"O Encoberto\" (\"The Hidden One\"), refers to Pessoa's vision of a future world of peace and the [[Fifth Empire]] (which, according to Pessoa, is spiritual and not material, because if it were material England would already have achieved it). After the Age of Force, (Vis), and Taedium (Otium) will come Science (understanding) through a reawakening of \"The Hidden One\", or \"King Sebastian\". The Hidden One represents the fulfillment of the destiny of mankind, designed by God since before Time, and the accomplishment of Portugal.\n\nKing Sebastian is very important, indeed he appears in all three parts of Mensagem. He represents the capacity of dreaming, and believing that it's possible to achieve dreams.\n\nOne of the most famous quotes from ''Mensagem'' is the first line from ''O Infante'' (belonging to the second Part), which is ''Deus quer, o homem sonha, a obra nasce'' (which translates roughly to \"God wishes, man dreams, the work is born\"). Another well-known quote from ''Mensagem'' is the first line from ''Ulysses'', \"O mito \u00e9 o nada que \u00e9 tudo\" (a possible translation is \"The myth is the nothing that is all\"). This poem refers to  [[Odysseus|Ulysses]], king of [[Ithaca]], as Lisbon's founder (recalling an ancient Greek myth).<ref>\n[http://purl.pt/13966/2/ ''Mensagem''] 1st. edition, 1934, at the Portuguese National Library.</ref>\n\n===Literary essays===\n\n[[File:A Aguia.JPG|thumb|right|200px|''A \u00c1guia \u2014 Organ of the Portuguese Renaissance'' \u2014 issue nr. 4, April 1912.]]\n\nIn 1912, Fernando Pessoa wrote a set of essays (later collected as ''The New Portuguese Poetry'') for the cultural journal ''A \u00c1guia'' (The Eagle), founded in [[Porto|Oporto]], in December 1910, and run by the republican association Renascen\u00e7a Portuguesa.<ref>Martins, Fernando Cabral (coord.) (2008). ''Dicion\u00e1rio de Fernando Pessoa e do Modernismo Portugu\u00eas''. Alfragide: Editorial Caminho.</ref> In the first years of the [[Portuguese Republic]], this cultural association was started by republican intellectuals led by the writer and poet [[Teixeira de Pascoaes]], philosopher Leonardo Coimbra and historian Jaime Cortes\u00e3o, aiming for the renewal of Portuguese culture through the aesthetic movement called Saudosismo.<ref>The Portuguese Republic was founded by the revolution of 5 October 1910, giving freedom of association and publishing.</ref> Pessoa contributed to the journal ''A \u00c1guia'' with a series of papers: 'The new Portuguese Poetry Sociologically Considered' (nr. 4), 'Relapsing...' (nr. 5) and 'The Psychological Aspect of the new Portuguese Poetry' (nrs. 9,11 and 12). These writings were strongly encomiastic to saudosist literature, namely the poetry of [[Teixeira de Pascoaes]] and [[M\u00e1rio Beir\u00e3o]]. The articles disclose Pessoa as a connoisseur of modern European literature and an expert of recent literary trends. On the other hand, he does not care much for a methodology of analysis or problems in the history of ideas. He states his confidence that Portugal would soon produce a great poet \u2013 a super-[[Cam\u00f5es]] \u2013 pledged to make an important contribution for European culture, and indeed, for humanity.<ref>Pessoa, Fernando (1993).

Lisboa: Edi\u00e7\u00f5es \u00c1tica.</ref>\n\n===Philosophical essays===\nThe philosophical notes of the young Pessoa, mostly written between 1905 and 1912, illustrate his debt to the history of [[Philosophy]] more through commentators than through a first-hand protracted reading of the Classics, ancient or modern.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} The issues he engages with pertain to every philosophical discipline and concern a large profusion of concepts, creating a vast semantic spectrum in texts whose length varies between half a dozen lines and half a dozen pages and whose density of analysis is extremely variable; simple paraphrasis, expression of assumptions and original speculation.\n\nPessoa sorted the philosophical systems thus:\n\n[[File:A Mensagem. Fernando Pessoa.jpg|thumb|300px|A passage from his famous poem \"Mar Portugu\u00eas\" from ''Message'', in the city of [[Lagos, Portugal]].]]\n\n# Relative Spiritualism and relative Materialism privilege \"Spirit\" or \"Matter\" as the main pole that organizes data around Experience.\n# Absolute Spiritualist and Absolute Materialist \"deny all objective reality to one of the elements of Experience\".\n# The materialistic [[Pantheism]] of [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] and the spiritualizing Pantheism of [[Nicolas Malebranche|Malebranche]], \"admit that experience is a double manifestation of any thing that in its essence has no matter neither spirit\".\n# Considering both elements as an \"illusory manifestation\", of a transcendent and true and alone realities, there is [[Transcendentalism]], inclined into matter with [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], or into spirit, a position where [[Henri Bergson|Bergson]] could be emplaced.\n# A terminal system \"the limited and summit of metaphysics\" would not radicalize \u2013 as poles of experience \u2013 one of the single categories: matter, relative, absolute, real, illusory, spirit. Instead, matching all categories, it takes contradiction as \"the essence of the universe\" and defends that \"an affirmation is so more true insofar the more contradiction involves\". The transcendent must be conceived beyond categories. There ''is one only and eternal example of it. It is that cathedral of thought -the philosophy of [[Hegel]].''\nSuch [[pantheist]] [[transcendentalism]] is used by Pessoa to define the project that \"encompasses and exceeds all systems\"; to characterize the new poetry of '''Saudosismo''' where the \"typical contradiction of this system\" occurs; to inquire of the particular social and political results of its adoption as the leading cultural paradigm; and, at last, he hints that metaphysics and religiosity strive \"to find in everything a beyond\".\n\n==Works==\n* {{citation | title = Hist\u00f3rias de um Raciocinador e o ensaio \"Hist\u00f3ria Policial\" (Tales of a Reasoner and the essay \"Detective Story\") bilingual edition, translated from the original writings in English | others = Ana Maria Freitas, edit & transl | place = Lisbon, Portugal | publisher = Ass\u00edrio & Alvim | year = 2012 | isbn = 978-972-0-79312-6 | url = http://www.assirio.pt/livros/ficha/historias-de-um-raciocinador-e-o-ensaio-historia-policial-?id=13029621 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130114073700/http://www.assirio.pt/livros/ficha/historias-de-um-raciocinador-e-o-ensaio-historia-policial-?id=13029621 | archivedate = 14 January 2013 | df = dmy-all }}\n* {{citation | title = Forever Someone Else \u2013 selected poems \u2013 2nd edition (enlarged) | origyear = 2008 | others = Richard Zenith, transl | place = Lisbon, Portugal | publisher = Ass\u00edrio & Alvim | year = 2010 | isbn = 978-972-37-1379-4 | url = http://www.assirio.pt/livros/ficha/forever-someone-else?id=11237521 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130114073341/http://www.assirio.pt/livros/ficha/forever-someone-else?id=11237521 | archivedate = 14 January 2013 | df = dmy-all }}\n* {{citation | title = Collected Poems of \u00c1lvaro de Campos | origyear = 1928\u201335 | others = Chris Daniels, transl | place = Exeter, UK | publisher = Shearsman Books | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-1-905700-25-7 | url = http://www.shearsman.com/pages/books/catalog/2009/pessoa_campos.html | access-date = 28 July 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101218061805/http://www.shearsman.com/pages/books/catalog/2009/pessoa_campos.html | archive-date = 18 December 2010 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}\n* {{citation | title = Lisbon: What the Tourist Should See | place = Exeter, UK | publisher = Shearsman Books | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-1-905700-25-7 | url = http://www.shearsman.com/pages/books/catalog/2008/pessoa_lisbon.html | access-date = 28 July 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110402025713/http://www.shearsman.com/pages/books/catalog/2008/pessoa_lisbon.html | archive-date = 2 April 2011 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}\n* {{citation | title = The Collected Poems of Alberto Caeiro | others = Chris Daniels, transl | place = Exeter, UK | publisher = Shearsman Books | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-1-905700-24-0 | url = http://www.shearsman.com/pages/books/catalog/2007/pessoa_caeiro.html | access-date = 28 July 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110404053758/http://www.shearsman.com/pages/books/catalog/2007/pessoa_caeiro.html | archive-date = 4 April 2011 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}\n* {{citation | title = Selected English Poems | place = Exeter, UK | publisher = Shearsman Books | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-1-905700-26-4 | url = http://www.shearsman.com/pages/books/catalog/2007/pessoa_engl.html | access-date = 28 July 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110402024401/http://www.shearsman.com/pages/books/catalog/2007/pessoa_engl.html | archive-date = 2 April 2011 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}\n* {{citation | title = Message | others = Jonathan Griffin, transl | place = Exeter, UK | publisher = Shearsman Books | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-1-905700-27-1 | url = http://www.shearsman.com/pages/books/catalog/2007/pessoa_msg.html | access-date = 28 July 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110402022853/http://www.shearsman.com/pages/books/catalog/2007/pessoa_msg.html | archive-date = 2 April 2011 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}\n* ''Selected English Poems '', ed.
