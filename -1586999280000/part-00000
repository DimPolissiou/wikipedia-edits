According to his former wife, [[Mandy Sayer]], he was discharged on 14 December 1966.<ref name=wifebook/> He worked as a specialist for the military paper, ''Southern Cross,'' covering actions and stories, interviewing fellow soldiers, and publishing articles on [[Vietnamese history]], which earned him a [[Bronze Star]].\n\nAfter his service, he attended college at the [[University of Colorado, Colorado Springs]], where he was an editor for the campus arts and literature publication, ''riverrun'', to which he also contributed. He began to write poetry in 1973 and took the name Yusef Komunyakaa. He earned his M.A. in Writing from [[Colorado State University]] in 1978, and an M.F.A. in Creative Writing from the [[University of California, Irvine]] in 1980. After receiving his M.F.A., Komunyakaa began teaching poetry in the New Orleans public school system and creative writing at the [[University of New Orleans]].\n\nKomunyakaa taught at Indiana University until the fall of 1997, when he became an English professor at [[Princeton University]]. Yusef Komunyakaa is a professor in the Creative Writing Program at [[New York University]].\n\n==Poetry==\n[[Image:Yusef Komunyakaa by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Komunyakaa at the 2006 [[Brooklyn Book Festival]].]] Komunyakaa's collection ''Copacetic'' fuses jazz rhythms and syncopation with hip colloquialism and the unique, arresting poetic imagery that has since become his trademark. It also outlines an abiding desire in his work to articulate cultural truths that remain unspoken in daily discourse, in the hope that they will bring a sort of redemption: \"How can love heal / the mouth shut this way... / Say something that resuscitates / us, behind the masks.\"\n\nKomunyakaa's ''I Apologize for the Eyes in My Head'', published in 1986, won the [[San Francisco Poetry Prize]]. More attention came with the publication of ''Dien Cai Dau'' ([[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] for \"crazy in the head\"), published in 1988, which focused on his experiences in Vietnam and won the [[Dark Room Poetry Prize]]. Included was the poem \"Facing It\", in which the speaker of the poems visits the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]] in Washington, D.C.:\n\n:He's lost his right arm\n:inside the stone. In the black mirror\n:a woman's trying to erase names\n:No, she's brushing a boy's hair.\n::\u2014 from \"Facing It\"<ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/ipa/poems/komunyakaa/facing_it.php Yusef Komunyakaa: Facing It at The Internet Poetry Archive]</ref>\n\nKomunyakaa many other published collections of poetry, include ''Taboo: The Wishbone Trilogy, Part I'' (2004), ''Pleasure Dome: New and Collected Poems, 1975-1999'' (2001),<ref>''Pleasure Dome: New and Collected Poems'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=oqD0VooTCloC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Yusef+Komunyakaa&sig=ACfU3U0hoXUJsg2onG3m8VfwYkHk0vXygA excerpts]</ref> ''Talking Dirty to the Gods'' (2000), ''Thieves of Paradise'' (1998), ''Neon Vernacular'' (1994), and ''Magic City'' (1992).\n\nIn 2004, Komunyakaa began a collaboration with [[dramaturge]] and theater producer [[Chad Gracia]] on a dramatic adaptation of ''The [[Epic of Gilgamesh]].'' The play was published in October 2006 by [[Wesleyan University Press]]. In spring 2008, New York's [[92nd Street Y]] staged a one-night performance by director [[Robert Scanlon]].

He views his own work as an indirectness, an \"insinuation\":<ref>[http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps/poets/g_l/komunyakaa/poetry.htm What is poetry], from \"Notations in Blue: Interview with Radiclani Clytus\", in ''Blue Notes: Essays, Interviews and Commentaries'', ed. Radiclani Clytus (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 2000).</ref>\n:Poetry is a kind of distilled insinuation. It\u2019s a way of expanding and talking around an idea or a question. Sometimes, more actually gets said through such a technique than a full frontal assault.\n\n==Marriage and family==\nKomunyakaa married [[Australian]] novelist [[Mandy Sayer]] in 1985. That year, he was hired as an associate professor at [[Indiana University]] in [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]]. He also held the Ruth Lilly Professorship for two years from 1989 to 1990. He and Sayer were married for ten years. \n\nHe later had a relationship with India-born poet [[Reetika Vazirani]], and they had a son Jehan together.

teaches at [[New York University]] and is a member of the [[Fellowship of Southern Writers]]. Komunyakaa is a recipient of the 1994 [[Kingsley Tufts Poetry Award]], for ''Neon Vernacular''<ref>Neon Vernacular [https://books.google.com/books?id=1nclTH1WxScC&pg=PP1&dq=neon+vernacular&sig=ACfU3U1pwzA-N5uO7nKVfF-BpIrLdDVwKw excerpts]</ref> and the 1994 [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]]. He also received the [[Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize]]. Komunyakaa received the 2007 [[Louisiana Writer Award]] for his enduring contribution to the poetry world.\n\nHis subject matter ranges from the black experience through rural Southern life before the [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights]] era and his experience as a soldier during the [[Vietnam War]].\n\n==Life and career==\nAccording to public records, Komunyakaa was born in 1947 and given the name James William Brown. (His former wife said in her memoir that he was born in 1941.)<ref name=wifebook/> He was the eldest of five children of James William Brown, a carpenter, and his wife.<ref>[http://www.blackpast.org/?q=aah/komunyakaa-yusef-1947 \"Yusef Komunyakaa\"],  BlackPast.org, Retrieved 28 March 2011</ref> He grew up in the small town of [[Bogalusa]], [[Louisiana]]. As an adult, he reclaimed the name ''Komunyakaa'', said to be his grandfather's African name. He  said that his grandfather had reached the United States as a stowaway in a ship from [[Trinidad]].<!-- ? --> {{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nBrown served in the [[US Army]], serving one tour of duty in [[South Vietnam]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. According to his former wife, [[Mandy Sayer]], he was discharged on 14 December 1966.<ref name=wifebook/> He worked as a specialist for the military paper, ''Southern Cross,'' covering actions and stories, interviewing fellow soldiers, and publishing articles on [[Vietnamese history]], which earned him a [[Bronze Star]].\n\nAfter his service, he attended college at the [[University of Colorado, Colorado Springs]], where he was an editor for the campus arts and literature publication, ''riverrun'', to which he also contributed. He began to write poetry in 1973 and took the name Yusef Komunyakaa. He earned his M.A. in Writing from [[Colorado State University]] in 1978, and an M.F.A. in Creative Writing from the [[University of California, Irvine]] in 1980. After receiving his M.F.A., Komunyakaa began teaching poetry in the New Orleans public school system and creative writing at the [[University of New Orleans]].\n\nKomunyakaa taught at Indiana University until the fall of 1997, when he became an English professor at [[Princeton University]]. Yusef Komunyakaa is a professor in the Creative Writing Program at [[New York University]].\n\n==Poetry==\n[[Image:Yusef Komunyakaa by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Komunyakaa at the 2006 [[Brooklyn Book Festival]].]] Komunyakaa's collection ''Copacetic'' fuses jazz rhythms and syncopation with hip colloquialism and the unique, arresting poetic imagery that has since become his trademark. It also outlines an abiding desire in his work to articulate cultural truths that remain unspoken in daily discourse, in the hope that they will bring a sort of redemption: \"How can love heal / the mouth shut this way... / Say something that resuscitates / us, behind the masks.\"\n\nKomunyakaa's ''I Apologize for the Eyes in My Head'', published in 1986, won the [[San Francisco Poetry Prize]]. More attention came with the publication of ''Dien Cai Dau'' ([[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] for \"crazy in the head\"), published in 1988, which focused on his experiences in Vietnam and won the [[Dark Room Poetry Prize]]. Included was the poem \"Facing It\", in which the speaker of the poems visits the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]] in Washington, D.C.:\n\n:He's lost his right arm\n:inside the stone. In the black mirror\n:a woman's trying to erase names\n:No, she's brushing a boy's hair.\n::\u2014 from \"Facing It\"<ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/ipa/poems/komunyakaa/facing_it.php Yusef Komunyakaa: Facing It at The Internet Poetry Archive]</ref>\n\nKomunyakaa many other published collections of poetry, include ''Taboo: The Wishbone Trilogy, Part I'' (2004), ''Pleasure Dome: New and Collected Poems, 1975-1999'' (2001),<ref>''Pleasure Dome: New and Collected Poems'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=oqD0VooTCloC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Yusef+Komunyakaa&sig=ACfU3U0hoXUJsg2onG3m8VfwYkHk0vXygA excerpts]</ref> ''Talking Dirty to the Gods'' (2000), ''Thieves of Paradise'' (1998), ''Neon Vernacular'' (1994), and ''Magic City'' (1992).\n\nIn 2004, Komunyakaa began a collaboration with [[dramaturge]] and theater producer [[Chad Gracia]] on a dramatic adaptation of ''The [[Epic of Gilgamesh]].'' The play was published in October 2006 by [[Wesleyan University Press]]. In spring 2008, New York's [[92nd Street Y]] staged a one-night performance by director [[Robert Scanlon]]. In May 2013 it received a full production by the [[Constellation Theatre Company (Washington, D.C.)|Constellation Theatre Company]] in Washington, D.C.\n<!-- removed 08jul21 since neither the award nor the building seem to be important enough.In 2007, Komunyakaa was awarded the [[Robert Creeley Poetry Award]] and visited the [[Parker Damon building]] to read some of his poetry to a receiving Massachusett's community.-->\n\nKomunyakaa's work has influenced many later American poets. He views his own work as an indirectness, an \"insinuation\":<ref>[http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps/poets/g_l/komunyakaa/poetry.htm What is poetry], from \"Notations in Blue: Interview with Radiclani Clytus\", in ''Blue Notes: Essays, Interviews and Commentaries'', ed. Radiclani Clytus (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 2000).</ref>\n:Poetry is a kind of distilled insinuation. It\u2019s a way of expanding and talking around an idea or a question. Sometimes, more actually gets said through such a technique than a full frontal assault.\n\n==Marriage and family==\nKomunyakaa married [[Australian]] novelist [[Mandy Sayer]] in 1985. That year, he was hired as an associate professor at [[Indiana University]] in [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]]. He also held the Ruth Lilly Professorship for two years from 1989 to 1990. He and Sayer were married for ten years. \n\nHe later had a relationship with India-born poet [[Reetika Vazirani]], and they had a son Jehan together. Vazirani killed the 2-year-old boy and committed suicide in 2003.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/the-failing-light-why-did-a-rising-young-poet-plunge-into-despair-taking-her-own-life-and-the-life-of-her-2-year-old-son/2015/01/15/2575a388-9d1f-11e4-96cc-e858eba91ced_story.html |title=The Failing Light: Why did a rising young poet plunge into despair, taking her own life and the life of her 2-year-old son? |last1=Span |first1=Paula |date=February 15, 2004 |website=www.washingtonpost.com |publisher=The Washington Post |access-date=December 5, 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Interviews ==\nOver the years, Komunyakaa has taken part in many interviews on his life and works.

The budget was estimated to be $1 million, which was attributed to the band wanting to be noticed on [[MTV]]. The song's dance routine was  choreographed by [[Darrin Henson]], who received a phone call from NSYNC's manager [[Johnny Wright (music manager)|Johnny Wright]], as he was about to quit the music industry after missing out on a [[MTV Video Music Award|VMA]] for [[Jordan Knight]]'s \"[[Give It to You (Jordan Knight song)|Give It to You]]\". Henson flew to [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] in 1999, where the band were performing at the [[Billboard Music Awards|''Billboard'' Music Awards]], so that he would be able to listen to the track. The band rehearsed at the Alley Kat Studio in Los Angeles over a few days, where Henson stated that he implemented moves which cannot be replicated by other groups.<ref name=\"EW20\">{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/music/2020/01/11/making-of-nsync-bye-bye-bye-music-video/|title=Inside the making of NSYNC's iconic 'Bye Bye Bye' music video|last=Kinane|first=Ruth|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=January 11, 2020|access-date=February 25, 2020}}</ref> In a 2020 interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', Henson discussed how he formulated the dance:<ref name=\"EW20\"/><blockquote>I turned the music up as loud as it could go [...] I came up with the pumping hand \u2014 that\u2019s the [[Raised fist|black power fist]] \u2014 and the hand going across the front during the 'bye bye bye' lyric is the 'stop talking s\u2014.' I come from the Bronx, and in New York whenever somebody said something, you'd put your hand up in a talking manner, like open and close, meaning, 'stop talking s\u2014.'</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Fillmore, CA, View W, Old Telegraph Road, October 13, 2011 - panoramio.jpg|thumb|right|Parts of the video were filmed in [[Fillmore, California]], as it was the only place for the train scene to be filmed.]] \n\nThey contacted Isham through the phone, before he met them during dance rehearsals for the song.<ref name=\"Billboard20\">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/9344530/nsync-video-director-wayne-isham-interview|title='F--k, Let's Just Go For It': *NSYNC Video Director Wayne Isham Talks 'Bye Bye Bye' & 'It's Gonna Be Me' Clips|last=Daw|first=Robbie|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=March 27, 2020|access-date=March 28, 2020}}</ref> During the music video's shoot, the band were fastened to bungee cords, mimicking [[puppet]]s on strings, as well as performing their choreography in a blue [[gimbal]] room, which Isham pointed out that it was inspired by [[Gene Kelly]] during the 1940s, as well as [[Lionel Richie]]'s video for \"[[Dancing on the Ceiling]]\", which was directed and choreographed by [[Stanley Donen]].<ref name=\"EW20\"/><ref name=\"Billboard20\"/> During the speeding train sequence, [[Joey Fatone]] and [[Chris Kirkpatrick]]  performed their own stunts as they jumped from one train carriage to another, as a [[Steadicam]] operator needed to be replaced mid-scene, due to being uncomfortable with the risk. [[JC Chasez]] and [[Lance Bass]] were placed in a red [[Dodge Viper|Dodge Viper RT/10]] as part of a car-chase scene inspired by Chasez's favorite film, ''[[Ronin (film)|Ronin]]'', where the film's stunt coordinators were hired to assist the shoot. The scene where Bass and Chasez drop into the car was filmed with a [[Semi-trailer truck|18 wheeler]] carrying a pole, which allowed the two to drop into the car.<ref name=\"EW20\"/> Both scenes were shot in [[Fillmore, California]], as it was the only place to film the train sequence.<ref name=\"Billboard20\"/> In an episode of ''[[Making the Video]]'', [[Justin Timberlake]] explained his reaction to shooting his scene in the music video:<ref name=\"Making\">{{cite episode|title=*NSYNC: Bye Bye Bye|series=[[Making the Video]]|network=[[MTV]]|date=January 23, 2000|season=2|number=2|language=en}}</ref><blockquote>JC and Lance jumped into a moving automobile, Chris and Joey are on top of a train running, so I think I got off easiest on the stunts [...] All I have to do is run, but I have to make it look good \u2014 I can't look like a dork when I'm running.

She cuts Joey Fatone and Chris Kirkpatrick loose first, as they run over the top of a speeding train and hide among the passengers to escape. She then cuts Justin Timberlake loose next, which he outruns her trained dogs inside a warehouse, eventually escaping into the pouring rain.\n\nLance Bass and JC Chasez are finally cut loose, as they fall into a red Dodge Viper RT/10. They speed away from her, as she drives a silver [[BMW Z3 (E36/4)|BMW Z3]]. Eventually, they make a sudden u-turn when they are blocked by a truck, while the puppet master is forced to brake slower, allowing them to escape.\n\nAll the scenes are interspersed with shots of the band dancing in a rotating blue gimbal with a fixed camera, making them appear as though they are on different planes of gravity. The video edit of the song also briefly pauses the music when Justin lands in the warehouse, as well as when Lance and JC land on the car and insert a [[cassette tape]] into the car, and their u-turn at the end of the video. The chorus is also extended twice at the end of the video; the first showcasing the band inside the box, while the second shows scenes of Lance and JC speeding away from the puppet master.\n\n===Reception===\nThe video reached #1 on ''[[Total Request Live|TRL]]'' for 25 straight days, second only to \"[[U Drive Me Crazy]]\", which made it to 26 straight days at #1.<ref>[http://atrl.net/trlarchive/?s=numberones ATRL - The TRL Archive - Number Ones<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The video placed at #60 on [[MuchMusic]]'s 100 Best Videos.

Eventually, they make a sudden u-turn when they are blocked by a truck, while the puppet master is forced to brake slower, allowing them to escape.\n\nAll the scenes are interspersed with shots of the band dancing in a rotating blue gimbal with a fixed camera, making them appear as though they are on different planes of gravity.

The King's messengers were acting on the orders of [[George Montague-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], newly appointed [[Secretary of State for the Northern Department]], \"to make strict and diligent search for ... the author, or one concerned in the writing of several weekly very seditious papers intitled, ''The Monitor, or British Freeholder''\".\n\nEntick sued the messengers for [[trespass]]ing on his land.\n\n==Judgment==\n[[Image:Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden by Sir Joshua Reynolds.jpg|right|thumb|Lord Camden]]\nThe trial took place in [[Westminster Hall]] presided over by Lord Camden, the [[Chief Justice of the Common Pleas]].

At the Marschallin's suggestion, Octavian acts as Ochs' ''Rosenkavalier'' by presenting a ceremonial silver rose to Sophie.

Though some critics took issue with Strauss' anachronistic use of [[waltz]] music, the public embraced the opera unconditionally.

The curtain rises to show them lounging in bed together just before daybreak (\"Wie du warst! Wie du bist\"). Loud voices are soon heard outside, and the Marschallin has Octavian hide, believing that her husband has returned early from a hunting trip. Octavian emerges in a skirt and bonnet (\"Befehl'n f\u00fcrstli' Gnad'n, i bin halt noch nit recht...\") and tries to sneak away, but the Marschallin's country cousin, Baron Ochs auf Lerchenau, bursts in through the same door.\n\nThe Baron is newly engaged to Sophie Faninal (\"Selbstverst\u00e4ndlich empf\u00e4ngt mich Ihro Gnaden\"), the daughter of a wealthy merchant, though this does not keep him from making lewd comments at the disguised Octavian. Ochs has come to ask two favors: he wants to borrow his cousin's [[Civil law notary#Germany|notary]] to write the marriage contract, and he wants her recommendation of a young nobleman to serve as his Rosenkavalier (\"Knight of the Rose\"), who will deliver the traditional silver engagement rose to Sophie. The Marschallin instructs \"Mariandel\" to fetch Octavian's miniature portrait and present it to the Baron. Ochs easily accepts Octavian as his Rosenkavalier, deciding that the \"maid\" must be that young count's \"bastard sister\", then insists that the Marschallin allow \"Mariandel\" to come and work for his new bride. She refuses as politely as possible and finally dismisses the \"maid\".\n\nA busy reception scene ensues as the room fills with vendors and supplicants to the Marschallin (\"Drei arme adelige Waisen\"), who ignores the former and aids the latter. A tenor sent by the Portuguese [[ambassador]] serenades her (\"Di rigori armato\") while Ochs sits down with the notary. Two Italian intriguers, Valzacchi and Annina, present scandal sheets for sale, which the Marschallin coldly declines. Ochs tries to stipulate a gift from Sophie's family consisting of all their properties, free from mortgages, and quickly loses patience with the notary's attempts to explain that this is illegal. Amidst all the activity, the Marschallin remarks to her hairdresser: \"My dear Hippolyte, today you have made me look like an old woman.\" (\"Mein lieber Hippolyte\"). This so disturbs her that she orders the room to be emptied. As the people file out, Valzacchi and Annina offer Baron Ochs their spying services. He asks whether they know anything about \"Mariandel\"; they promptly lie and claim to know all about her.\n\nThe Marschallin, now alone, ponders her waning youth and the unhappiness of her forced marriage, perceiving the same in store for Sophie Faninal (\"Da geht er hin...\"). Octavian returns, dressed again in men's clothes (\"Ach, du bist wieder da\"). When he sees that the Marschallin is out of sorts, he assumes it is from her earlier fear that he might have been discovered. But she is still thinking of the passage of time (a clock is heard chiming thirteen times) and tells him that, very soon, he will leave her for someone younger and prettier. Octavian reacts with frustration, and the Marschallin turns him away. Too late, she realizes that she has neglected to kiss him goodbye. With nothing else to be done, she summons her young page, Mohammed, to take the silver rose to Octavian, then stares pensively into her hand mirror (or similar) as the curtain falls.\n\n[[File:Faistauer Richard Mayr als Ochs.jpg|thumb|upright|1927 portrait of [[Richard Mayr]] as Ochs by [[Anton Faistauer]]. Mayr sang this role 149 times in Vienna, Salzburg and London.]]\n\n===Act 2===\n''The von Faninals' palace''\n\nThe next day, Herr von Faninal exultantly and Sophie nervously await the arrival of the Rosenkavalier (\"Ein ernster Tag, ein grosser Tag!\"). Following tradition, Faninal departs before the Knight appears, saying that he will return with the bridegroom. Sophie prays to keep her sense of humility through all the rapid changes happening in her life, but she is repeatedly interrupted by her [[Chaperone (social)|duenna]], Marianne, who reports from the window on the Rosenkavalier's elaborate entourage (\"In dieser feierlichen Stunde der Pr\u00fcfung\"). Octavian arrives with great pomp, dressed all in silver, and presents the silver rose to Sophie (\"Mir ist die Ehre widerfahren...\"). She smells it, saying it is as sweet as a greeting from Heaven itself. Octavian, instantly smitten, joins her avowal that they will remember this moment until death.\n\nThey settle into a chaperoned conversation. Sophie reveals that she already knows Octavian's full name \u2013 Octavian Maria Ehrenreich Bonaventura Fernand Hyacinth Rofrano \u2013 from studying the catalogue of Austrian nobility to prepare for her marriage. She even knows his nickname: Quinquin, which only intimate friends (including the Marschallin) call him. She adds that she likes him very much. Ochs then enters with Faninal (\"Jetzt aber kommt mein Herr Zuk\u00fcnftiger\") and wastes no time revealing his character to the bride, loudly examining Sophie's body and comparing her to \"an unbroken filly\" when she protests. Once he leaves the room with Faninal to finalize the marriage contract, Sophie and Octavian quickly agree that she will not marry the Baron under any circumstances.\n\nThe young lovers' rapturous duet (\"Mit Ihren Augen voll Tr\u00e4nen\") is soon interrupted by Valzacchi and Annina, who surprise them and call for Ochs. Octavian challenges the Baron to a duel. Ochs runs forward, scratches his arm on the point of Octavian's drawn sword, and screams so that Faninal and the rest of the household come rushing in. Sophie begs her father to call off the wedding, to no avail: Octavian is asked to leave, and Sophie is sent to her room. Ochs is left on the divan, his arm in a sling, nursing a bottle of [[Port wine|port]] and fantasies of revenge against Octavian. But Annina brings him something that raises his spirits much more quickly: a letter signed by \"Mariandel,\" the \"chambermaid\" from Act 1, asking for a tryst. At this, Ochs forgets his sling and waltzes across the stage, ignoring Annina's hints for a tip \u2013 and missing her quiet promise to get even (\"Da lieg' ich!\").\n\n===Act 3===\n''A private room in a shabby inn''\n\nValzacchi and Annina, fed up with the Baron, help Octavian prepare a trap the following evening. Elaborate preparations are seen in [[pantomime]] before Ochs arrives with \"Mariandel,\" ready for a cozy dinner at a table set for two.\n\nIn spite of himself, Ochs is disturbed by \"Mariandel's\" uncanny resemblance to his nemesis Octavian, and he keeps catching glimpses of strange apparitions in the room. A disguised Annina bursts in, calling Ochs her husband and the father of her (numerous) children, who crowd around him crying \"Papa! Papa!\" The Baron calls for the police; to his unpleasant surprise, the vice squad treats ''him'' with suspicion, and Valzacchi is suddenly claiming not to know him. The police inspector asks about the \"woman\" accompanying him, and Ochs lies that \"she\" is his fianc\u00e9e, Sophie Faninal \u2013 just in time for Herr von Faninal to arrive, demanding to know why Ochs' messenger (presumably Valzacchi) has summoned him to this disreputable place. When asked if \"Mariandel\" is his daughter, Faninal retorts in a rage that his daughter is outside. The real Sophie enters and announces once and for all that she does not consider Baron Ochs her bridegroom. Her apoplectic father staggers out, leaning on her shoulder.\n\n\"Mariandel\" now offers to make a statement in private, and retires behind a screen with the Police Inspector. Soon Ochs sees articles of women's clothing coming into view. He rages against the vice squad, but is interrupted by the arrival of the Marschallin. The Police Inspector greets her before clearing the room, and she explains to the Baron that he has been had. Sophie returns, and Octavian emerges, to confirm that they set up a \"masquerade\" together to break his engagement. Ochs, glancing back and forth between Octavian and the Marschallin, now grasps the nature of their relationship and asks for hush money. But he is cowed by the Marschallin's force of will (if not the sight of Octavian's sword) and ingloriously departs, pursued by children and bill collectors.\n\n[[File:Salzburger Festspiele 2014 \u2013 Der Rosenkavalier Foto 2.jpg|300px|thumb|Farewell of Marschallin in act 3, with [[Mojca Erdmann]], [[Sophie Koch]] and [[Krassimira Stoyanova]] (from left to right), [[Salzburg Festival]] 2014]]\nThe Marschallin, Sophie, and Octavian are left alone, and Octavian does not know what to do. The Marschallin introduces herself to Sophie, recognizing that the day she feared has come (Trio: \"Marie Theres'!\" / \"Hab' mir's gelobt\"), and releases Octavian to be with the woman he truly loves. She then withdraws, with a promise to Sophie that she will offer Faninal a face-saving ride home in her carriage. As soon as she is gone, Sophie and Octavian run to each other's arms. Faninal and the Marschallin return to find them locked in an embrace. With a last, bittersweet look toward her lost lover, the Marschallin heads for the carriage with Faninal. Sophie and Octavian follow after another brief but ecstatic love duet (\"Ist ein Traum\" / \"Sp\u00fcr' nur dich\"). The opera ends with little Mohammed trotting in to retrieve Sophie's dropped handkerchief, then racing out again after the others.\n\n==Instrumentation==\nStrauss's score is [[Instrumentation (music)|written for]] the following:<ref>[http://www.boosey.com/shop/work-info/Strauss-Rosenkavalier-Suite-op-59/6042 Work details] at [[Boosey & Hawkes]]; [https://en.schott-music.com/shop/der-rosenkavalier-no230.html work details] at [[Schott Music]]</ref>\n* [[Woodwind]]: 3 [[western concert flute|flute]]s (III doubling on [[piccolo]]), 2 [[oboe]]s, [[English horn]] (also doubling on 3rd oboe), 3 [[clarinet]]s (III also clarinet in D & E flat), [[basset horn]] (doubles [[bass clarinet]] in B flat and A), 3 [[bassoon]]s (III also [[contrabassoon]])\n* [[Brass instrument|Brass]]: 4 [[French horn]]s, 3 [[trumpet]]s, 3 [[trombone]]s, [[bass tuba]]\n* [[Percussion]]: [[timpani]], [[bass drum]] and [[cymbal]]s, [[triangle]], [[tambourine]], [[glockenspiel]], [[Ratchet (instrument)|ratchet]], [[tenor drum]], [[snare drum]], [[jingle bell]]s, [[castanets]]\n* [[Celesta]], 2 [[harp]]s\n* [[string section|Strings]]: 16 [[violin]]s I, 16 violins II, 12 [[viola]]s, 10 [[cello]]s, 8 [[double bass]]es\n* Off-stage: 2 flutes, oboe, 3 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 2 [[French horn]]s, [[trumpet]], [[drum]], [[Pump organ|harmonium]], [[piano]], [[string orchestra|strings]]<ref>{{cite book|title=Der Rosenkavalier Study Guide|author=Michael Kennedy|authorlink=Michael Kennedy (music critic)|page=28, note 9|chapter=Comedy for Music \u2013 Act Three|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-oRjDwAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA28|year=2011|orig-year=1980|publisher=Overture|location=London|isbn=9780714544953}}</ref>\n\n==''Rosenkavalier'' Suite==\nIn 1945 Strauss allowed an orchestral ''Rosenkavalier'' Suite to be published, but he was apparently not involved in creating it.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=SseCAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT446 Del Mar 1992], p. 19 on books.google.com</ref> It is likely that conductor [[Artur Rodzi\u0144ski]] arranged it, as he had conducted the Suite's first performance, which was in October 1944 by the [[New York Philharmonic]].<ref>[http://www.laphil.com/philpedia/music/rosenkavalier-suite-richard-strauss \"About the Piece: ''Rosenkavalier Suite''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714130645/http://www.laphil.com/philpedia/music/rosenkavalier-suite-richard-strauss |date=2014-07-14 }}, programme note on laphil.com</ref><ref>Don Anderson, [http://www.tso.ca/en-ca/Plan-Your-Experience/Programme-Notes/Suite-from-Der-Rosenkavalier.aspx?ID=4807&pID=4438 Programme Notes: \"R.

Next comes the appearance of Octavian as the \"Rosenkavalier\", which is depicted in tender music; the sight of him looking so young makes the Marschallin realise that he will soon leave her for a younger woman. There follows the duet between Octavian and Sophie (oboe and [[French horn|horn]]) \u2013 in which their love for each other becomes ever more obvious, but this is abruptly interrupted by the discordant music associated with the clumsy arrival of Ochs. Next the violins tentatively introduce the first waltz, which is followed by another given out by the solo violin, before the whole orchestra settles into waltz mode. A general pause and a violin solo leads into the nostalgic music where the Marschallin sadly realises she has lost Octavian. Then comes its ecstatic climax. The work closes with a singularly robust waltz, depicting Ochs at his most pompous, and a boisterous coda newly composed for the suite.\n\n==Language==\n[[Hugo von Hofmannsthal|Hofmannsthal]]'s libretto is a combination of different forms of the German language. Members of the nobility speak in very refined language, often archaic (set to the time of the opera) and very courteous. In more intimate circles they use a more familiar style of speech ({{Lang|de|[[T\u2013V distinction#German|du]]}}). For instance, the conversations between Octavian and the Marschallin in the first act use the familiar \"you\" but switch back and forth between more formal speech (''[[wikt:Sie|Sie]]'') and the familiar ''[[Du (personal pronoun)#German|du]]'',<ref name=\"Jefferson\" /> as well as the intermediate (and now obsolete) ''[[wikt:Er#Pronoun|Er]]''.<ref>For example, \"Beklagt Er sich \u00fcber das, Qinquin?\" in \"Wie Du warst!\" on [http://www.dlib.indiana.edu/variations/scores/bhq8846/large/sco10010.gif page 10] of the piano-vocal score referred to below.</ref>\n\nSome productions of the opera include a glossary in the programme to help clarify the contextual meaning of the language used, which is mostly lost in translation. Baron Ochs makes clumsy, mannered attempts at using refined or flamboyant language, making use of non-German words and phrases such as {{Lang|it|corpo di Bacco!}} (meaning \"by Bacchus' body!\" in Italian), some of which he mispronounces. The language used by Octavian when impersonating Mariandel, and by other non-noble characters, is an Austrian dialect, whose connotations are difficult for non-native speakers to grasp. The German used by the Italians, Valzacchi and Annina, is also very broken and marked by Italian accentuations.<ref name=\"Jefferson\" />\n\nIn English translations of the opera, these dialects have been accounted for with varying degrees of rigor; the Chandos Highlights version, for example, uses only standard British English.<ref name=\"Jefferson\" />\n\n==Grainger's ''Ramble''==\n[[Percy Grainger]] wrote an elaborate and complex piano transcription of a theme from this opera. The ''Ramble on the Last Love Duet in Der Rosenkavalier'' is one of Grainger's more complex piano transcriptions, with many sumptuous ornamentations and harmonic twists and turns.\n\n==Recordings==\n{{Main|Der Rosenkavalier discography}}\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist}}\n\n'''Sources'''\n* Jefferson, Alan (1985).

The curtain rises to show them lounging in bed together just before daybreak (\"Wie du warst! Wie du bist\"). Loud voices are soon heard outside, and the Marschallin has Octavian hide, believing that her husband has returned early from a hunting trip. Octavian emerges in a skirt and bonnet (\"Befehl'n f\u00fcrstli' Gnad'n, i bin halt noch nit recht...\") and tries to sneak away, but the Marschallin's country cousin, Baron Ochs auf Lerchenau, bursts in through the same door.\n\nThe Baron is newly engaged to Sophie Faninal (\"Selbstverst\u00e4ndlich empf\u00e4ngt mich Ihro Gnaden\"), the daughter of a wealthy merchant, though this does not keep him from making lewd comments at the disguised Octavian. Ochs has come to ask two favors: he wants to borrow his cousin's [[Civil law notary#Germany|notary]] to write the marriage contract, and he wants her recommendation of a young nobleman to serve as his Rosenkavalier (\"Knight of the Rose\"), who will deliver the traditional silver engagement rose to Sophie. The Marschallin instructs \"Mariandel\" to fetch Octavian's miniature portrait and present it to the Baron. Ochs easily accepts Octavian as his Rosenkavalier, deciding that the \"maid\" must be that young count's \"bastard sister\", then insists that the Marschallin allow \"Mariandel\" to come and work for his new bride. She refuses as politely as possible and finally dismisses the \"maid\".\n\nA busy reception scene ensues as the room fills with vendors and supplicants to the Marschallin (\"Drei arme adelige Waisen\"), who ignores the former and aids the latter. A tenor sent by the Portuguese [[ambassador]] serenades her (\"Di rigori armato\") while Ochs sits down with the notary. Two Italian intriguers, Valzacchi and Annina, present scandal sheets for sale, which the Marschallin coldly declines. Ochs tries to stipulate a gift from Sophie's family consisting of all their properties, free from mortgages, and quickly loses patience with the notary's attempts to explain that this is illegal. Amidst all the activity, the Marschallin remarks to her hairdresser: \"My dear Hippolyte, today you have made me look like an old woman.\" (\"Mein lieber Hippolyte\"). This so disturbs her that she orders the room to be emptied. As the people file out, Valzacchi and Annina offer Baron Ochs their spying services. He asks whether they know anything about \"Mariandel\"; they promptly lie and claim to know all about her.\n\nThe Marschallin, now alone, ponders her waning youth and the unhappiness of her forced marriage, perceiving the same in store for Sophie Faninal (\"Da geht er hin...\"). Octavian returns, dressed again in men's clothes (\"Ach, du bist wieder da\"). When he sees that the Marschallin is out of sorts, he assumes it is from her earlier fear that he might have been discovered. But she is still thinking of the passage of time (a clock is heard chiming thirteen times) and tells him that, very soon, he will leave her for someone younger and prettier. Octavian reacts with frustration, and the Marschallin turns him away. Too late, she realizes that she has neglected to kiss him goodbye. With nothing else to be done, she summons her young page, Mohammed, to take the silver rose to Octavian, then stares pensively into her hand mirror (or similar) as the curtain falls.\n\n[[File:Faistauer Richard Mayr als Ochs.jpg|thumb|upright|1927 portrait of [[Richard Mayr]] as Ochs by [[Anton Faistauer]].

Following tradition, Faninal departs before the Knight appears, saying that he will return with the bridegroom. Sophie prays to keep her sense of humility through all the rapid changes happening in her life, but she is repeatedly interrupted by her [[Chaperone (social)|duenna]], Marianne, who reports from the window on the Rosenkavalier's elaborate entourage (\"In dieser feierlichen Stunde der Pr\u00fcfung\"). Octavian arrives with great pomp, dressed all in silver, and presents the silver rose to Sophie (\"Mir ist die Ehre widerfahren...\"). She smells it, saying it is as sweet as a greeting from Heaven itself. Octavian, instantly smitten, joins her avowal that they will remember this moment until death.\n\nThey settle into a chaperoned conversation. Sophie reveals that she already knows Octavian's full name \u2013 Octavian Maria Ehrenreich Bonaventura Fernand Hyacinth Rofrano \u2013 from studying the catalogue of Austrian nobility to prepare for her marriage. She even knows his nickname: Quinquin, which only intimate friends (including the Marschallin) call him. She adds that she likes him very much. Ochs then enters with Faninal (\"Jetzt aber kommt mein Herr Zuk\u00fcnftiger\") and wastes no time revealing his character to the bride, loudly examining Sophie's body and comparing her to \"an unbroken filly\" when she protests. Once he leaves the room with Faninal to finalize the marriage contract, Sophie and Octavian quickly agree that she will not marry the Baron under any circumstances.\n\nThe young lovers' rapturous duet (\"Mit Ihren Augen voll Tr\u00e4nen\") is soon interrupted by Valzacchi and Annina, who surprise them and call for Ochs. Octavian challenges the Baron to a duel. Ochs runs forward, scratches his arm on the point of Octavian's drawn sword, and screams so that Faninal and the rest of the household come rushing in. Sophie begs her father to call off the wedding, to no avail: Octavian is asked to leave, and Sophie is sent to her room. Ochs is left on the divan, his arm in a sling, nursing a bottle of [[Port wine|port]] and fantasies of revenge against Octavian. But Annina brings him something that raises his spirits much more quickly: a letter signed by \"Mariandel,\" the \"chambermaid\" from Act 1, asking for a tryst. At this, Ochs forgets his sling and waltzes across the stage, ignoring Annina's hints for a tip \u2013 and missing her quiet promise to get even (\"Da lieg' ich!\").\n\n===Act 3===\n''A private room in a shabby inn''\n\nValzacchi and Annina, fed up with the Baron, help Octavian prepare a trap the following evening. Elaborate preparations are seen in [[pantomime]] before Ochs arrives with \"Mariandel,\" ready for a cozy dinner at a table set for two.\n\nIn spite of himself, Ochs is disturbed by \"Mariandel's\" uncanny resemblance to his nemesis Octavian, and he keeps catching glimpses of strange apparitions in the room. A disguised Annina bursts in, calling Ochs her husband and the father of her (numerous) children, who crowd around him crying \"Papa! Papa!\" The Baron calls for the police; to his unpleasant surprise, the vice squad treats ''him'' with suspicion, and Valzacchi is suddenly claiming not to know him. The police inspector asks about the \"woman\" accompanying him, and Ochs lies that \"she\" is his fianc\u00e9e, Sophie Faninal \u2013 just in time for Herr von Faninal to arrive, demanding to know why Ochs' messenger (presumably Valzacchi) has summoned him to this disreputable place. When asked if \"Mariandel\" is his daughter, Faninal retorts in a rage that his daughter is outside. The real Sophie enters and announces once and for all that she does not consider Baron Ochs her bridegroom. Her apoplectic father staggers out, leaning on her shoulder.\n\n\"Mariandel\" now offers to make a statement in private, and retires behind a screen with the Police Inspector. Soon Ochs sees articles of women's clothing coming into view. He rages against the vice squad, but is interrupted by the arrival of the Marschallin. The Police Inspector greets her before clearing the room, and she explains to the Baron that he has been had. Sophie returns, and Octavian emerges, to confirm that they set up a \"masquerade\" together to break his engagement. Ochs, glancing back and forth between Octavian and the Marschallin, now grasps the nature of their relationship and asks for hush money. But he is cowed by the Marschallin's force of will (if not the sight of Octavian's sword) and ingloriously departs, pursued by children and bill collectors.\n\n[[File:Salzburger Festspiele 2014 \u2013 Der Rosenkavalier Foto 2.jpg|300px|thumb|Farewell of Marschallin in act 3, with [[Mojca Erdmann]], [[Sophie Koch]] and [[Krassimira Stoyanova]] (from left to right), [[Salzburg Festival]] 2014]]\nThe Marschallin, Sophie, and Octavian are left alone, and Octavian does not know what to do. The Marschallin introduces herself to Sophie, recognizing that the day she feared has come (Trio: \"Marie Theres'!\" / \"Hab' mir's gelobt\"), and releases Octavian to be with the woman he truly loves. She then withdraws, with a promise to Sophie that she will offer Faninal a face-saving ride home in her carriage. As soon as she is gone, Sophie and Octavian run to each other's arms. Faninal and the Marschallin return to find them locked in an embrace. With a last, bittersweet look toward her lost lover, the Marschallin heads for the carriage with Faninal. Sophie and Octavian follow after another brief but ecstatic love duet (\"Ist ein Traum\" / \"Sp\u00fcr' nur dich\"). The opera ends with little Mohammed trotting in to retrieve Sophie's dropped handkerchief, then racing out again after the others.\n\n==Instrumentation==\nStrauss's score is [[Instrumentation (music)|written for]] the following:<ref>[http://www.boosey.com/shop/work-info/Strauss-Rosenkavalier-Suite-op-59/6042 Work details] at [[Boosey & Hawkes]]; [https://en.schott-music.com/shop/der-rosenkavalier-no230.html work details] at [[Schott Music]]</ref>\n* [[Woodwind]]: 3 [[western concert flute|flute]]s (III doubling on [[piccolo]]), 2 [[oboe]]s, [[English horn]] (also doubling on 3rd oboe), 3 [[clarinet]]s (III also clarinet in D & E flat), [[basset horn]] (doubles [[bass clarinet]] in B flat and A), 3 [[bassoon]]s (III also [[contrabassoon]])\n* [[Brass instrument|Brass]]: 4 [[French horn]]s, 3 [[trumpet]]s, 3 [[trombone]]s, [[bass tuba]]\n* [[Percussion]]: [[timpani]], [[bass drum]] and [[cymbal]]s, [[triangle]], [[tambourine]], [[glockenspiel]], [[Ratchet (instrument)|ratchet]], [[tenor drum]], [[snare drum]], [[jingle bell]]s, [[castanets]]\n* [[Celesta]], 2 [[harp]]s\n* [[string section|Strings]]: 16 [[violin]]s I, 16 violins II, 12 [[viola]]s, 10 [[cello]]s, 8 [[double bass]]es\n* Off-stage: 2 flutes, oboe, 3 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 2 [[French horn]]s, [[trumpet]], [[drum]], [[Pump organ|harmonium]], [[piano]], [[string orchestra|strings]]<ref>{{cite book|title=Der Rosenkavalier Study Guide|author=Michael Kennedy|authorlink=Michael Kennedy (music critic)|page=28, note 9|chapter=Comedy for Music \u2013 Act Three|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-oRjDwAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA28|year=2011|orig-year=1980|publisher=Overture|location=London|isbn=9780714544953}}</ref>\n\n==''Rosenkavalier'' Suite==\nIn 1945 Strauss allowed an orchestral ''Rosenkavalier'' Suite to be published, but he was apparently not involved in creating it.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=SseCAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT446 Del Mar 1992], p. 19 on books.google.com</ref> It is likely that conductor [[Artur Rodzi\u0144ski]] arranged it, as he had conducted the Suite's first performance, which was in October 1944 by the [[New York Philharmonic]].<ref>[http://www.laphil.com/philpedia/music/rosenkavalier-suite-richard-strauss \"About the Piece: ''Rosenkavalier Suite''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714130645/http://www.laphil.com/philpedia/music/rosenkavalier-suite-richard-strauss |date=2014-07-14 }}, programme note on laphil.com</ref><ref>Don Anderson, [http://www.tso.ca/en-ca/Plan-Your-Experience/Programme-Notes/Suite-from-Der-Rosenkavalier.aspx?ID=4807&pID=4438 Programme Notes: \"R.

Next comes the appearance of Octavian as the \"Rosenkavalier\", which is depicted in tender music; the sight of him looking so young makes the Marschallin realise that he will soon leave her for a younger woman. There follows the duet between Octavian and Sophie (oboe and [[French horn|horn]]) \u2013 in which their love for each other becomes ever more obvious, but this is abruptly interrupted by the discordant music associated with the clumsy arrival of Ochs. Next the violins tentatively introduce the first waltz, which is followed by another given out by the solo violin, before the whole orchestra settles into waltz mode. A general pause and a violin solo leads into the nostalgic music where the Marschallin sadly realises she has lost Octavian. Then comes its ecstatic climax. The work closes with a singularly robust waltz, depicting Ochs at his most pompous, and a boisterous coda newly composed for the suite.\n\n==Language==\n[[Hugo von Hofmannsthal|Hofmannsthal]]'s libretto is a combination of different forms of the German language. Members of the nobility speak in very refined language, often archaic (set to the time of the opera) and very courteous. In more intimate circles they use a more familiar style of speech ({{Lang|de|[[T\u2013V distinction#German|du]]}}). For instance, the conversations between Octavian and the Marschallin in the first act use the familiar \"you\" but switch back and forth between more formal speech (''[[wikt:Sie|Sie]]'') and the familiar ''[[Du (personal pronoun)#German|du]]'',<ref name=\"Jefferson\" /> as well as the intermediate (and now obsolete) ''[[wikt:Er#Pronoun|Er]]''.<ref>For example, \"Beklagt Er sich \u00fcber das, Qinquin?\" in \"Wie Du warst!\" on [http://www.dlib.indiana.edu/variations/scores/bhq8846/large/sco10010.gif page 10] of the piano-vocal score referred to below.</ref>\n\nSome productions of the opera include a glossary in the programme to help clarify the contextual meaning of the language used, which is mostly lost in translation. Baron Ochs makes clumsy, mannered attempts at using refined or flamboyant language, making use of non-German words and phrases such as {{Lang|it|corpo di Bacco!}} (meaning \"by Bacchus' body!\" in Italian), some of which he mispronounces. The language used by Octavian when impersonating Mariandel, and by other non-noble characters, is an Austrian dialect, whose connotations are difficult for non-native speakers to grasp. The German used by the Italians, Valzacchi and Annina, is also very broken and marked by Italian accentuations.<ref name=\"Jefferson\" />\n\nIn English translations of the opera, these dialects have been accounted for with varying degrees of rigor; the Chandos Highlights version, for example, uses only standard British English.<ref name=\"Jefferson\" />\n\n==Grainger's ''Ramble''==\n[[Percy Grainger]] wrote an elaborate and complex piano transcription of a theme from this opera. The ''Ramble on the Last Love Duet in Der Rosenkavalier'' is one of Grainger's more complex piano transcriptions, with many sumptuous ornamentations and harmonic twists and turns.\n\n==Recordings==\n{{Main|Der Rosenkavalier discography}}\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist}}\n\n'''Sources'''\n* Jefferson, Alan (1985).

The northern and western regions of India passed into the hands of a dozen or more feudatory states.\nPrabhakara Vardhana, the ruler of Sthanvisvara, who belonged to the Vardhana family, extended his control over neighbouring states. Prabhakar Vardhana was the first king of the Vardhana dynasty with his capital at [[Thanesar|Thaneswar]].\nAfter Prabhakar Vardhana's death in 605, his eldest son, Rajya Vardhana, ascended the throne.

Harsha's brother, Rajya Vardhana, then the king at [[Thanesar]], could not accept this affront on his family.  So he marched against Devagupta and defeated him.  However, [[Shashanka]], king of Gauda in Eastern [[Bengal]], then entered [[Magadha]] as a friend of Rajyavardhana, but in secret alliance with the [[Malwa]] king.
