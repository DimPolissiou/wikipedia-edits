They are often used in [[Special relativity|relativistic]] calculations<ref group=\"note\"> By Einstein himself, as in his book: {{cite web | url =https://archive.org/details/B-001-001-738/page/n0 | title =The Meaning of Relativity (1956, 5th Edition)| last =Einstein | first =Albert | publisher =Princeton University Press (2005)| year =2005}}, pag 21 et seq.</ref>, and are the unit of choice in High Energy Physics ([[particle physics]]).  They are particularly convenient when performing calculations in spatial dimensions greater than three such as in [[string theory]].\n\n==Length\u2013Mass\u2013Time Framework==\n\nAs in the Gaussian units, the Heaviside\u2013Lorentz units (HLU in this article) use the ''length\u2013mass\u2013time'' dimensions.  This means that all of the electric and magnetic units are ''derived units'', dependent on the sizes of length and force.\n\nCoulomb's equation, used to derive the unit of charge, is {{math|1=''F'' = ''QQ''/''r''<sup>2</sup>}} in the Gaussian system, and {{math|1=''F'' = ''qq''/4''\u03c0r''<sup>2</sup>}} in the HLU.  The unit of charge then connects to {{math|1=1 dyn cm<sup>2</sup> = 1 esu<sup>2</sup> = 4''\u03c0'' hlu}}.  The HLU charge is then {{math|{{sqrt|4''\u03c0''}}}} larger than the Gaussian (see below), and the rest follows.\n\nWhen dimensional analysis for the  SI units is used, including {{mvar|\u03b5<sub>0</sub>}} and {{mvar|\u03bc<sub>0</sub>}} are used to convert units, the result gives the conversion to and from the Heaviside\u2013Lorentz units.  For example, charge is {{math|1={{sqrt|''\u03b5<sub>0</sub>L''<sup>3</sup>''MT''<sup>\u22122</sup>}}}}.  When one puts {{math|''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} 8.854 pF/m}}, {{math|''L'' {{=}} 0.01 m}}, {{math|''M'' {{=}} 0.001 kg}}, and {{math|''T'' {{=}} 1}} second, this evaluates as {{val|9.409669| e=-11|u=C}}.  This is the size of the HLU unit of charge.\n\nBecause the Heaviside\u2013Lorentz units continue to use separate electric and magnetic units, an additional constant is needed when electric and magnetic quantities appear in the same formula.  As in the Gaussian system, this constant appears as the electromagnetic velocity {{math|''c''}}.\n\n==Rationalization==\n\nIn system-independent form, the Maxwell equations are\n:<math> \\begin{align}\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{D} &= \\rho / \\beta, \\\\\n \\quad \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} &= 0, \\\\\n \\quad \\kappa \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} &= -\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t}, \\\\\n \\quad \\kappa \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{H} &= \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{D}}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{J} / \\beta,\n\\end{align}</math>\nalong with {{math|1='''D''' = ''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub>'''E'''}} and {{math|1='''B''' = ''\u03bc''<sub>0</sub>'''H'''}}.\nThe constants {{math|1=''\u03b2''}} and {{math|1=''\u03ba''}} vary from system to system.  One can show that {{math|1=''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub>''\u03bc''<sub>0</sub>''c''<sup>2</sup> = ''\u03ba''<sup>2</sup>}}.\n\n:The Gaussian system puts {{math|1=''\u03b2'' = 1/4''\u03c0''}}, {{math|1=''\u03ba'' = ''c''}}.\n:The HLU system puts {{math|1=''\u03b2'' = 1}}, {{math|1=''\u03ba'' = ''c''}}.\n:The SI system puts {{math|1=''\u03b2'' = 1}}, {{math|1=''\u03ba'' = 1}}.\n\nWhat rationalisation does is to replace the radiance constant ({{math|1=''\u03b3''}} = intensity at radius<sup>2</sup> / source) with the gaussian divergence constant ({{math|1=''\u03b2''}} = flux through a surface / enclosed sources). One can easily show that {{math|1=''\u03b3'' = 4''\u03c0\u03b2''}}, by considering the case of a sphere around a point, and intensity as density of flux. The older models set {{math|1=''\u03b3'' = 1}}, while the rationalised systems have {{math|1=''\u03b2'' = 1}}.  Rationalized equations in physics generally have a factor related to the effective spatial symmetry: {{math|1=2}} for planar symmetry, {{math|1=2''\u03c0''}} for cylindrical symmetry and {{math|1=4''\u03c0''}} for spherical symmetry.\n\nThe constant {{math|1=''\u03ba''}} connects the electric and magnetic units through {{math|1=''Q'' = ''I\u03bat''}}.  When electric and magnetic systems are defined as in the Gaussian or Heaviside\u2013Lorentz systems, {{math|1=''\u03ba'' = ''c''}} derives from the electromagnetic wave equations.  Most systems have {{math|1=''\u03ba'' = 1}}, where the electric and magnetic systems are connected by {{math|1=''Q'' = ''It''}}. Therefore, most books use {{math|1=''Q'' = ''It''}} instead of {{math|1=''Q'' = ''I\u03bat''}}.\n\n==Maxwell's equations with sources==\n\nWith Lorentz\u2013Heaviside units, [[Maxwell's equations]] in [[free space]] with sources take the following form:\n\n:<math> \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E} = \\rho \\,</math>\n\n:<math> \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0 \\,</math>\n\n:<math> \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = -\\frac{1}{c} \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}} {\\partial t} \\,</math>\n\n:<math> \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\frac{1}{c} \\frac{ \\partial \\mathbf{E}} {\\partial t} + \\frac{1}{c} \\mathbf{J} \\,</math>\n\nwhere {{math|1=''c''}} is the [[speed of light in vacuum]].  Here {{math|1='''E''' = '''D'''}} is the [[electric field]], {{math|1='''H''' = '''B'''}} is the [[magnetic field]], {{math|1=''\u03c1''}} is [[charge density]], and {{math|1='''J'''}} is [[current density]].\n\nThe [[Lorentz force]] equation is:\n\n::<math>\\mathbf{F}_q = q \\left(\\mathbf{E} + \\frac{\\mathbf{v}_q}{c} \\times \\mathbf{B}\\right) \\,</math>\n\nhere {{math|1=''q''}} is the charge of a test particle with vector velocity {{math|1='''v'''<sub>''q''</sub>}} and {{math|1='''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>}} is the combined electric and magnetic force acting on that test particle.\n\nIn both the Gaussian and Heaviside\u2013Lorentz systems, the electrical and magnetic units are derived from the mechanical systems.  Charge is defined through Coulomb's equation, with {{math|1=''\u03b5'' = 1}}.  In the Gaussian system, Coulomb's equation is {{math|1=''F'' = ''QQ''/''R''<sup>2</sup>}}.  In the Heaviside Lorentz system, {{math|1=''F'' = ''qq''/4''\u03c0R''<sup>2</sup>}}.  From this, one sees that {{math|1=''QQ'' = ''qq''/4''\u03c0''}}, that the Gaussian units are larger by a factor of {{math|1={{sqrt|4''\u03c0''}}}}.  Other quantities follow as follows.\n\n:<math> q_\\mathrm{LH} \\ = \\ \\sqrt{4\\pi} \\ q_\\mathrm{G} </math>\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{E}_\\mathrm{LH} \\ = \\ {\\mathbf{E}_\\mathrm{G} \\over \\sqrt{4\\pi}} </math>\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{B}_\\mathrm{LH} \\ = \\ {\\mathbf{B}_\\mathrm{G} \\over \\sqrt{4\\pi}} </math>.\n\n==List of equations and comparison with other systems of units==\n\nThis section has a list of the basic formulae of electromagnetism, given in Lorentz\u2013Heaviside, Gaussian and SI units.

The conversion requires no changes to the factor {{math|1=4''\u03c0''}}, unlike for the Gaussian equations. Coulomb's inverse-square law equation in SI is {{math|1='''F''' = ''q''<sub>1</sub>''q''<sub>2</sub>/4''\u03c0\u03b5''<sub>0</sub>''r''<sup>2</sup>}}.

The Gaussian form does not have the {{math|1=4''\u03c0''}} in the denominator.\n\nBy setting {{math|1=''c'' = 1}} with HLU, Maxwell's equations and the Lorentz equation become the same as the SI example with {{math|1=''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub> = ''\u00b5''<sub>0</sub> = ''c'' = 1}}.\n\n:<math> \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E} = \\rho \\,</math>\n\n:<math> \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0 \\,</math>\n\n:<math> \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = -\\frac{ \\partial \\mathbf{B}} {\\partial t} \\,</math>\n\n:<math> \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} =  \\frac{ \\partial \\mathbf{E}} {\\partial t} + \\mathbf{J} \\,</math>\n\n::<math>\\mathbf{F}_q = q (\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v}_q \\times \\mathbf{B}) \\,</math>\n\nBecause these equations can be easily related to SI work, HLU-style (i.e. rationalized) systems are becoming more fashionable.\n\n===In quantum mechanics===\n\nAdditionally setting {{math|1=''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub> = ''\u00b5''<sub>0</sub> = ''c'' = ''\u0127'' = ''k''{{sub|B}} = 1}} yields a natural unit system parameterized by a single value, the mass scale {{math|''m''}}.

They are often used in [[Special relativity|relativistic]] calculations<ref group=\"note\"> By Einstein himself, as in his book: {{cite web | url =https://archive.org/details/B-001-001-738/page/n0 | title =The Meaning of Relativity (1956, 5th Edition)| last =Einstein | first =Albert | publisher =Princeton University Press (2005)| year =2005}}, pag 21 et seq.</ref>, and are the unit of choice in High Energy Physics ([[particle physics]]).  They are particularly convenient when performing calculations in spatial dimensions greater than three such as in [[string theory]].\n\n==Length\u2013Mass\u2013Time Framework==\n\nAs in the Gaussian units, the Heaviside\u2013Lorentz units (HLU in this article) use the ''length\u2013mass\u2013time'' dimensions.  This means that all of the electric and magnetic units are ''derived units'', dependent on the sizes of length and force.\n\nCoulomb's equation, used to derive the unit of charge, is {{math|1=''F'' = ''QQ''/''r''<sup>2</sup>}} in the Gaussian system, and {{math|1=''F'' = ''qq''/4''\u03c0r''<sup>2</sup>}} in the HLU.  The unit of charge then connects to {{math|1=1 dyn cm<sup>2</sup> = 1 esu<sup>2</sup> = 4''\u03c0'' hlu}}.  The HLU charge is then {{math|{{sqrt|4''\u03c0''}}}} larger than the Gaussian (see below), and the rest follows.\n\nWhen dimensional analysis for the  SI units is used, including {{mvar|\u03b5<sub>0</sub>}} and {{mvar|\u03bc<sub>0</sub>}} are used to convert units, the result gives the conversion to and from the Heaviside\u2013Lorentz units.  For example, charge is {{math|1={{sqrt|''\u03b5<sub>0</sub>L''<sup>3</sup>''MT''<sup>\u22122</sup>}}}}.  When one puts {{math|''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} 8.854 pF/m}}, {{math|''L'' {{=}} 0.01 m}}, {{math|''M'' {{=}} 0.001 kg}}, and {{math|''T'' {{=}} 1}} second, this evaluates as {{val|9.409669| e=-11|u=C}}.  This is the size of the HLU unit of charge.\n\nBecause the Heaviside\u2013Lorentz units continue to use separate electric and magnetic units, an additional constant is needed when electric and magnetic quantities appear in the same formula.  As in the Gaussian system, this constant appears as the electromagnetic velocity {{math|''c''}}.\n\n==Rationalization==\n\nIn system-independent form, the Maxwell equations are\n:<math> \\begin{align}\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{D} &= \\rho / \\beta, \\\\\n \\quad \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} &= 0, \\\\\n \\quad \\kappa \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} &= -\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t}, \\\\\n \\quad \\kappa \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{H} &= \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{D}}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{J} / \\beta,\n\\end{align}</math>\nalong with {{math|1='''D''' = ''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub>'''E'''}} and {{math|1='''B''' = ''\u03bc''<sub>0</sub>'''H'''}}.\nThe constants {{math|1=''\u03b2''}} and {{math|1=''\u03ba''}} vary from system to system.  One can show that {{math|1=''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub>''\u03bc''<sub>0</sub>''c''<sup>2</sup> = ''\u03ba''<sup>2</sup>}}.\n\n:The Gaussian system puts {{math|1=''\u03b2'' = 1/4''\u03c0''}}, {{math|1=''\u03ba'' = ''c''}}.\n:The HLU system puts {{math|1=''\u03b2'' = 1}}, {{math|1=''\u03ba'' = ''c''}}.\n:The SI system puts {{math|1=''\u03b2'' = 1}}, {{math|1=''\u03ba'' = 1}}.\n\nWhat rationalisation does is to replace the radiance constant ({{math|1=''\u03b3''}} = intensity at radius<sup>2</sup> / source) with the gaussian divergence constant ({{math|1=''\u03b2''}} = flux through a surface / enclosed sources). One can easily show that {{math|1=''\u03b3'' = 4''\u03c0\u03b2''}}, by considering the case of a sphere around a point, and intensity as density of flux. The older models set {{math|1=''\u03b3'' = 1}}, while the rationalised systems have {{math|1=''\u03b2'' = 1}}.  Rationalized equations in physics generally have a factor related to the effective spatial symmetry: {{math|1=2}} for planar symmetry, {{math|1=2''\u03c0''}} for cylindrical symmetry and {{math|1=4''\u03c0''}} for spherical symmetry.\n\nThe constant {{math|1=''\u03ba''}} connects the electric and magnetic units through {{math|1=''Q'' = ''I\u03bat''}}.  When electric and magnetic systems are defined as in the Gaussian or Heaviside\u2013Lorentz systems, {{math|1=''\u03ba'' = ''c''}} derives from the electromagnetic wave equations.  Most systems have {{math|1=''\u03ba'' = 1}}, where the electric and magnetic systems are connected by {{math|1=''Q'' = ''It''}}. Therefore, most books use {{math|1=''Q'' = ''It''}} instead of {{math|1=''Q'' = ''I\u03bat''}}.\n\n==Maxwell's equations with sources==\n\nWith Lorentz\u2013Heaviside units, [[Maxwell's equations]] in [[free space]] with sources take the following form:\n\n:<math> \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E} = \\rho \\,</math>\n\n:<math> \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0 \\,</math>\n\n:<math> \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = -\\frac{1}{c} \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}} {\\partial t} \\,</math>\n\n:<math> \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\frac{1}{c} \\frac{ \\partial \\mathbf{E}} {\\partial t} + \\frac{1}{c} \\mathbf{J} \\,</math>\n\nwhere {{math|1=''c''}} is the [[speed of light in vacuum]].  Here {{math|1='''E''' = '''D'''}} is the [[electric field]], {{math|1='''H''' = '''B'''}} is the [[magnetic field]], {{math|1=''\u03c1''}} is [[charge density]], and {{math|1='''J'''}} is [[current density]].\n\nThe [[Lorentz force]] equation is:\n\n::<math>\\mathbf{F}_q = q \\left(\\mathbf{E} + \\frac{\\mathbf{v}_q}{c} \\times \\mathbf{B}\\right) \\,</math>\n\nhere {{math|1=''q''}} is the charge of a test particle with vector velocity {{math|1='''v'''<sub>''q''</sub>}} and {{math|1='''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>}} is the combined electric and magnetic force acting on that test particle.\n\nIn both the Gaussian and Heaviside\u2013Lorentz systems, the electrical and magnetic units are derived from the mechanical systems.  Charge is defined through Coulomb's equation, with {{math|1=''\u03b5'' = 1}}.  In the Gaussian system, Coulomb's equation is {{math|1=''F'' = ''QQ''/''R''<sup>2</sup>}}.  In the Heaviside Lorentz system, {{math|1=''F'' = ''qq''/4''\u03c0R''<sup>2</sup>}}.  From this, one sees that {{math|1=''QQ'' = ''qq''/4''\u03c0''}}, that the Gaussian units are larger by a factor of {{math|1={{sqrt|4''\u03c0''}}}}.  Other quantities follow as follows.\n\n:<math> q_\\mathrm{LH} \\ = \\ \\sqrt{4\\pi} \\ q_\\mathrm{G} </math>\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{E}_\\mathrm{LH} \\ = \\ {\\mathbf{E}_\\mathrm{G} \\over \\sqrt{4\\pi}} </math>\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{B}_\\mathrm{LH} \\ = \\ {\\mathbf{B}_\\mathrm{G} \\over \\sqrt{4\\pi}} </math>.\n\n==List of equations and comparison with other systems of units==\n\nThis section has a list of the basic formulae of electromagnetism, given in Lorentz\u2013Heaviside, Gaussian and SI units.

The conversion requires no changes to the factor {{math|1=4''\u03c0''}}, unlike for the Gaussian equations. Coulomb's inverse-square law equation in SI is {{math|1='''F''' = ''q''<sub>1</sub>''q''<sub>2</sub>/4''\u03c0\u03b5''<sub>0</sub>''r''<sup>2</sup>}}.  Set {{math|1=''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub> = 1}} to get the HLU form: {{math|1='''F''' = ''q''<sub>1</sub>''q''<sub>2</sub>/4''\u03c0r''<sup>2</sup>}}.  The Gaussian form does not have the {{math|1=4''\u03c0''}} in the denominator.\n\nBy setting {{math|1=''c'' = 1}} with HLU, Maxwell's equations and the Lorentz equation become the same as the SI example with {{math|1=''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub> = ''\u00b5''<sub>0</sub> = ''c'' = 1}}.\n\n:<math> \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E} = \\rho \\,</math>\n\n:<math> \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0 \\,</math>\n\n:<math> \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = -\\frac{ \\partial \\mathbf{B}} {\\partial t} \\,</math>\n\n:<math> \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} =  \\frac{ \\partial \\mathbf{E}} {\\partial t} + \\mathbf{J} \\,</math>\n\n::<math>\\mathbf{F}_q = q (\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v}_q \\times \\mathbf{B}) \\,</math>\n\nBecause these equations can be easily related to SI work, HLU-style (i.e. rationalized) systems are becoming more fashionable.\n\n===In quantum mechanics===\n\nAdditionally setting {{math|1=''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub> = ''\u00b5''<sub>0</sub> = ''c'' = ''\u0127'' = ''k''{{sub|B}} = 1}} yields a natural unit system parameterized by a single value, the mass scale {{math|''m''}}.

Later in the same year, the FDA sent an FDA Drug Bulletin to all U.S. physicians advising against the use of DES in pregnant women.

Their cases survived a [[Daubert]] hearing. In 2013, the Fecho sisters who initiated the breast cancer/DES link litigation agreed to an undisclosed settlement amount on the second day of trial.
