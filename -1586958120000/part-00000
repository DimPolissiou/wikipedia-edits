''[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]'', [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]], Editor.</ref></center>]]\nThe '''gens Licinia''' was a celebrated [[plebs|plebeian]] family at [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], which appears from the earliest days of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]] until [[Roman Empire|imperial times]], and which eventually obtained the imperial dignity. The first of the [[gens]] to obtain the [[Roman consul|consulship]] was [[Gaius Licinius Stolo|Gaius Licinius Calvus Stolo]], who, as [[tribune|tribune of the plebs]] from 376 to 367 BC, prevented the election of any of the annual [[Roman Magistrates|magistrates]], until the [[patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]] acquiesced to the passage of the ''[[lex Licinia Sextia]]'', or Licinian Rogations. This law, named for Licinius and his colleague, [[Lucius Sextius]], opened the consulship for the first time to the plebeians. Licinius himself was subsequently elected consul in 364 and 361 BC, and from this time, the Licinii became one of the most illustrious gentes in the Republic.<ref>Drumann, ''Geschichte Roms''.</ref><ref name=\"DGRBM Licinia Gens\">''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. II, p. 782 (\"Licinia Gens\").</ref>\n\n==Origin==\nThe [[Roman naming conventions|nomen]] ''Licinius'' is derived from the [[cognomen]] ''Licinus'', or \"upturned\", found in a number of Roman gentes.<ref name=\"Chase 109\">Chase, p. 109.</ref>  ''Licinus'' may have been an ancient [[praenomen]], but few examples of its use as such are known.  The name seems to be identical with the [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] ''Lecne'', which frequently occurs on Etruscan sepulchral monuments.<ref>Lanzi, vol. II, p. 342.</ref> Some scholars have seen evidence of an Etruscan origin for the Licinii in the tradition that Etruscan players were first brought to Rome to take part in the theatrical performances (''[[ludi scaenici]]'') in the consulship of Gaius Licinius Calvus, BC 364.  This could, however, be coincidental, as [[Livy]] explains that the games were instituted this year in order to palliate the anger of the gods.<ref>Livy, vii. 2.</ref>  In fact, the name of ''Licinius'' appears to have been spread throughout both [[Latium]] and [[Etruria]] from a very early time, so the fact that it had an Etruscan equivalent does not definitely show that the gens was of Etruscan derivation.<ref name=\"DGRBM Licinia Gens\"/>\n\n==Praenomina==\nThe chief praenomina used by the Licinii were ''[[Publius (praenomen)|Publius]], [[Gaius (praenomen)|Gaius]], [[Lucius (praenomen)|Lucius]]'', and ''[[Marcus (praenomen)|Marcus]]'', all of which were very common throughout Roman history. The family occasionally used ''[[Sextus (praenomen)|Sextus]]'', and there is at least one instance of ''[[Gnaeus (praenomen)|Gnaeus]]'' during the first century BC.  ''[[Aulus (praenomen)|Aulus]]'' was used by the Licinii Nervae.  As in other Roman families, the women of the Licinii generally did not have formal praenomina, but were referred to simply as ''Licinia''; if further distinction were needed, they would be described using various personal or family cognomina.\n\n==Branches and cognomina==\nThe family-names of the Licinii are ''Calvus'' (with the [[agnomen|agnomina]] ''Esquilinus'' and ''Stolo''), ''Crassus'' (with the agnomen ''Dives''), ''Geta, Lucullus, Macer, Murena, Nerva, Sacerdos'', and ''Varus''. The other cognomina of the gens are personal surnames, rather than family-names; these include ''Archias, Caecina, Damasippus, Imbrex, Lartius, Lenticula, Nepos, Proculus, Regulus, Rufinus, Squillus'', and ''Tegula''. The only cognomina which occur on coins are ''Crassus, Macer, Murena, Nerva'', and ''Stolo''. A few Licinii are known without a surname; most of these in later times were [[freedman|freedmen]].<ref name=\"DGRBM Licinia Gens\"/>\n\nThe surname ''Calvus'' was originally given to a person who was bald,<ref name=\"Chase 110\">Chase, p. 110</ref> and it was the cognomen of the earliest family of the Licinii to distinguish itself under the Republic. The first of this family bore the agnomen ''Esquilinus'', probably because he lived on the [[Esquiline Hill]].<ref>Chase, pp. 113, 114.</ref> ''Stolo'', a surname given to the most famous of the family, may be derived from the ''stola'', a long outer garment or cloak, or might also refer to a branch, or sucker.<ref>Chase, pp. 112 (''Stola''), 113 (''Stolo'').</ref><ref name=\"DGRBM Calvus\">''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. I, p. 586 (\"Calvus\").</ref>  Although the family of the Licinii Calvi afterward vanished into obscurity, the surname ''Calvus'' was later borne by the celebrated orator and poet [[Gaius Licinius Macer Calvus|Gaius Licinius Macer]], who lived in the first century BC.  His cognomen ''Macer'', designated someone who was lean.<ref name=\"Chase 110\"/><ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. I, p. 586 (\"Calvus\", \"Gaius Licinius Macer Calvus\").</ref><ref name=\"Cassell's\">''Cassell's Latin and English Dictionary''.</ref>\n\nAnother family of the Licinii bore the cognomen ''Varus'', which means \"crooked, bent,\" or \"knock-kneed.\"<ref name=\"Chase 109\"/> The Licinii Vari were already distinguished, when their surname was replaced by that of ''Crassus.'' This was a common surname, which could mean \"dull, thick,\" or \"solid,\" and may have been adopted because of the contrast between this meaning and that of ''Varus''.<ref name=\"Chase 110\"/><ref name=\"Cassell's\"/>\n\nThe surname ''Dives'', meaning \"rich\" or \"wealthy,\" was borne by some of the Licinii Crassi.<ref>Chase, p. 111.</ref>  It was most famous as the surname of [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]], the triumvir, and has been ascribed to his father and brothers, but it is not altogether certain whether it originated with his father, or with the triumvir, in which case it was retroactively applied to the previous generation.<ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. I, pp. 872, 873 (\"Crassus\").</ref><ref>Marshall, \"Crassus and the Cognomen ''Dives''.\"</ref><ref>Drumann, vol. IV, pp. 71\u2013115.</ref>\n\n''Lucullus'', the cognomen of a branch of the Licinii, which first occurs in history towards the end of the [[Second Punic War]], is probably derived from ''lucus'', a grove, or perhaps a diminutive of the ''[[praenomen]] [[Lucius (praenomen)|Lucius]]''. The surname does not appear on any coins of the gens.<ref name=\"Chase 113\">Chase, p. 113.</ref><ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. II, pp. 830, 831 (\"Lucullus\").</ref>\n\nA family of the Licinii bore the surname ''Murena'' (sometimes, but erroneously, written ''Muraena''), referring to the sea-fish known as the murry or lamprey, a prized delicacy since ancient times.  This family came from the city of [[Lanuvium]], to the southeast of Rome, and was said to have acquired its name because one of its members had a great liking for lampreys, and built tanks for them.  The same surname occurring in other families might be said to be derived from the type of shellfish known as ''[[murex]]'', from which a valuable dye was extracted.<ref name=\"Chase 113\"/><ref>Pliny the Elder, ''Naturalis Historia'', ix. 54.</ref><ref>Macrobius, ''Saturnalia'', ii. 11.</ref><ref>Drumann, vol. IV, p. 183 ''ff''.</ref><ref name=\"DGRBM Murena\">''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. II, p. 1121 (\"Murena\").</ref>\n\nOf the other surnames of the Licinii might be mentioned ''Nerva'', the surname of a family of the Licinii that flourished from the time of the [[Second Punic War]] until the early Empire, derived from ''nervus'', \"sinewy\";<ref name=\"Chase 110\"/> ''Geta'', perhaps the name of a [[Thracians|Thracian]] people, to whom one of the Licinii might have been compared;<ref>''The New College Latin & English Dictionary'', \"Geta\".</ref> and ''Sacerdos'', a priest, one of a number of cognomina derived from occupations.<ref>Chase, pp. 111, 112.</ref><ref>''The New College Latin & English Dictionary'', \"sacerdos\".</ref>\n\n==Members==\n{{filiation}}\n\n===Early Licinii===\n* Gaius Licinius, one of the first ''[[tribune|tribuni plebis]]'' elected, in 493 BC.

This identification may have been based on Livius' identification of ''Licinius'' Menenius as the tribune of that year.

''[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]'', [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]], Editor.</ref></center>]]\nThe '''gens Licinia''' was a celebrated [[plebs|plebeian]] family at [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], which appears from the earliest days of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]] until [[Roman Empire|imperial times]], and which eventually obtained the imperial dignity. The first of the [[gens]] to obtain the [[Roman consul|consulship]] was [[Gaius Licinius Stolo|Gaius Licinius Calvus Stolo]], who, as [[tribune|tribune of the plebs]] from 376 to 367 BC, prevented the election of any of the annual [[Roman Magistrates|magistrates]], until the [[patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]] acquiesced to the passage of the ''[[lex Licinia Sextia]]'', or Licinian Rogations. This law, named for Licinius and his colleague, [[Lucius Sextius]], opened the consulship for the first time to the plebeians. Licinius himself was subsequently elected consul in 364 and 361 BC, and from this time, the Licinii became one of the most illustrious gentes in the Republic.<ref>Drumann, ''Geschichte Roms''.</ref><ref name=\"DGRBM Licinia Gens\">''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. II, p. 782 (\"Licinia Gens\").</ref>\n\n==Origin==\nThe [[Roman naming conventions|nomen]] ''Licinius'' is derived from the [[cognomen]] ''Licinus'', or \"upturned\", found in a number of Roman gentes.<ref name=\"Chase 109\">Chase, p. 109.</ref>  ''Licinus'' may have been an ancient [[praenomen]], but few examples of its use as such are known.  The name seems to be identical with the [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] ''Lecne'', which frequently occurs on Etruscan sepulchral monuments.<ref>Lanzi, vol. II, p. 342.</ref> Some scholars have seen evidence of an Etruscan origin for the Licinii in the tradition that Etruscan players were first brought to Rome to take part in the theatrical performances (''[[ludi scaenici]]'') in the consulship of Gaius Licinius Calvus, BC 364.  This could, however, be coincidental, as [[Livy]] explains that the games were instituted this year in order to palliate the anger of the gods.<ref>Livy, vii. 2.</ref>  In fact, the name of ''Licinius'' appears to have been spread throughout both [[Latium]] and [[Etruria]] from a very early time, so the fact that it had an Etruscan equivalent does not definitely show that the gens was of Etruscan derivation.<ref name=\"DGRBM Licinia Gens\"/>\n\n==Praenomina==\nThe chief praenomina used by the Licinii were ''[[Publius (praenomen)|Publius]], [[Gaius (praenomen)|Gaius]], [[Lucius (praenomen)|Lucius]]'', and ''[[Marcus (praenomen)|Marcus]]'', all of which were very common throughout Roman history. The family occasionally used ''[[Sextus (praenomen)|Sextus]]'', and there is at least one instance of ''[[Gnaeus (praenomen)|Gnaeus]]'' during the first century BC.  ''[[Aulus (praenomen)|Aulus]]'' was used by the Licinii Nervae.  As in other Roman families, the women of the Licinii generally did not have formal praenomina, but were referred to simply as ''Licinia''; if further distinction were needed, they would be described using various personal or family cognomina.\n\n==Branches and cognomina==\nThe family-names of the Licinii are ''Calvus'' (with the [[agnomen|agnomina]] ''Esquilinus'' and ''Stolo''), ''Crassus'' (with the agnomen ''Dives''), ''Geta, Lucullus, Macer, Murena, Nerva, Sacerdos'', and ''Varus''. The other cognomina of the gens are personal surnames, rather than family-names; these include ''Archias, Caecina, Damasippus, Imbrex, Lartius, Lenticula, Nepos, Proculus, Regulus, Rufinus, Squillus'', and ''Tegula''. The only cognomina which occur on coins are ''Crassus, Macer, Murena, Nerva'', and ''Stolo''. A few Licinii are known without a surname; most of these in later times were [[freedman|freedmen]].<ref name=\"DGRBM Licinia Gens\"/>\n\nThe surname ''Calvus'' was originally given to a person who was bald,<ref name=\"Chase 110\">Chase, p. 110</ref> and it was the cognomen of the earliest family of the Licinii to distinguish itself under the Republic. The first of this family bore the agnomen ''Esquilinus'', probably because he lived on the [[Esquiline Hill]].<ref>Chase, pp. 113, 114.</ref> ''Stolo'', a surname given to the most famous of the family, may be derived from the ''stola'', a long outer garment or cloak, or might also refer to a branch, or sucker.<ref>Chase, pp. 112 (''Stola''), 113 (''Stolo'').</ref><ref name=\"DGRBM Calvus\">''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. I, p. 586 (\"Calvus\").</ref>  Although the family of the Licinii Calvi afterward vanished into obscurity, the surname ''Calvus'' was later borne by the celebrated orator and poet [[Gaius Licinius Macer Calvus|Gaius Licinius Macer]], who lived in the first century BC.  His cognomen ''Macer'', designated someone who was lean.<ref name=\"Chase 110\"/><ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. I, p. 586 (\"Calvus\", \"Gaius Licinius Macer Calvus\").</ref><ref name=\"Cassell's\">''Cassell's Latin and English Dictionary''.</ref>\n\nAnother family of the Licinii bore the cognomen ''Varus'', which means \"crooked, bent,\" or \"knock-kneed.\"<ref name=\"Chase 109\"/> The Licinii Vari were already distinguished, when their surname was replaced by that of ''Crassus.'' This was a common surname, which could mean \"dull, thick,\" or \"solid,\" and may have been adopted because of the contrast between this meaning and that of ''Varus''.<ref name=\"Chase 110\"/><ref name=\"Cassell's\"/>\n\nThe surname ''Dives'', meaning \"rich\" or \"wealthy,\" was borne by some of the Licinii Crassi.<ref>Chase, p. 111.</ref>  It was most famous as the surname of [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]], the triumvir, and has been ascribed to his father and brothers, but it is not altogether certain whether it originated with his father, or with the triumvir, in which case it was retroactively applied to the previous generation.<ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. I, pp. 872, 873 (\"Crassus\").</ref><ref>Marshall, \"Crassus and the Cognomen ''Dives''.\"</ref><ref>Drumann, vol. IV, pp. 71\u2013115.</ref>\n\n''Lucullus'', the cognomen of a branch of the Licinii, which first occurs in history towards the end of the [[Second Punic War]], is probably derived from ''lucus'', a grove, or perhaps a diminutive of the ''[[praenomen]] [[Lucius (praenomen)|Lucius]]''. The surname does not appear on any coins of the gens.<ref name=\"Chase 113\">Chase, p. 113.</ref><ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. II, pp. 830, 831 (\"Lucullus\").</ref>\n\nA family of the Licinii bore the surname ''Murena'' (sometimes, but erroneously, written ''Muraena''), referring to the sea-fish known as the murry or lamprey, a prized delicacy since ancient times.  This family came from the city of [[Lanuvium]], to the southeast of Rome, and was said to have acquired its name because one of its members had a great liking for lampreys, and built tanks for them.  The same surname occurring in other families might be said to be derived from the type of shellfish known as ''[[murex]]'', from which a valuable dye was extracted.<ref name=\"Chase 113\"/><ref>Pliny the Elder, ''Naturalis Historia'', ix. 54.</ref><ref>Macrobius, ''Saturnalia'', ii. 11.</ref><ref>Drumann, vol. IV, p. 183 ''ff''.</ref><ref name=\"DGRBM Murena\">''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. II, p. 1121 (\"Murena\").</ref>\n\nOf the other surnames of the Licinii might be mentioned ''Nerva'', the surname of a family of the Licinii that flourished from the time of the [[Second Punic War]] until the early Empire, derived from ''nervus'', \"sinewy\";<ref name=\"Chase 110\"/> ''Geta'', perhaps the name of a [[Thracians|Thracian]] people, to whom one of the Licinii might have been compared;<ref>''The New College Latin & English Dictionary'', \"Geta\".</ref> and ''Sacerdos'', a priest, one of a number of cognomina derived from occupations.<ref>Chase, pp. 111, 112.</ref><ref>''The New College Latin & English Dictionary'', \"sacerdos\".</ref>\n\n==Members==\n{{filiation}}\n\n===Early Licinii===\n* Gaius Licinius, one of the first ''[[tribune|tribuni plebis]]'' elected, in 493 BC.

This identification may have been based on Livius' identification of ''Licinius'' Menenius as the tribune of that year.

The ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'' supposes that Stolo was consul in both years.

He made four albums including the soundtrack to the movie ''Go Fast''. He is one of the founders of the record label InFin\u00e9. Since he is attached to the city of Lyon, he also took part in the creation of the French indie and electronic music festival Les [[Nuits Sonores]].\n\n==Background and early life==\nAgoria is not like any other rave child. At the beginning of the 90s, he experienced a golden age where history was written with each new evening. Electronic music had no code or face yet, only a few values that it was quick to forget. Since then, as one of the pioneers who invented techno in France, he has proven himself by escaping from the framework that he himself has contributed to creating and ventured successfully into the universe of cinema, fashion and contemporary art.\n\nIt all starts in Lyon, at a time when incomprehension and repression against techno are such that any night that does not end in police custody for rave organizers is a victory. No evening is the same. It is in this context, in December 1993, at only 17 years old, that S\u00e9bastien Devaud - who is not yet called Agoria - takes the decks for the \ufb01rst time in public, at Space, a club in Lyon with multiple corridors. He plays before Richie Hawtin and Carl Cox and ... \"nobody dances\". A \ufb01lm student, he just refused to work on a \ufb01lming of James Ivory in order to mix for this evening: \"I wondered for a moment if I had made the right choice \u00bb.\n\nIt is at the microphone of a local radio station in Lyon, for four hours every Saturday, then on Tuesdays, when his passion for music grew and his horizons broadened. \"These years of radio trained and nourished me, that's how I understood that there were good songs in all styles and that I had to take an open approach.\" The richness and diversity of the music he composes and plays today was born in those moments.\n\n==Career==\nAgoria \ufb01rst produced records in 1999, \"La Onzieme Marche\", \ufb01rst released in 2001 on Tekmics, marked his \ufb01rst big step. Today it's a classic, mixed and remixed by a lot of DJs and the starting point for his meeting with the label Pias which released his \ufb01rst two albums - \"Blossom\" in 2003 featuring Tricky, then \"The Green Armchair \u201din 2006 with the participation of Neneh Cherry and Peter Murphy, leader of the legendary Bauhaus. With these albums, Agoria began to impose his oblique universe, inspired by that of the pioneers of Detroit, but \"twisted\" by a funny contemporary pulsation, tinged with pop, soul and hip-hop.\n\nThis desire to compose real music for today, while avoiding the codes that often sti\ufb02e it, found its peak with the album \"Impermanence\" in 2011 and even more with \"Drift\", released in collaboration with Mercury / Universal in 2019. More than any other of his albums, \"Drift\" con\ufb01rmed Agoria's talent for the sensuality of acoustic melodies and the re\ufb01nement of modernist productions, without ever completely denying his electronic roots.\n\nAgoria's desire \"to constantly try new adventures\", lead him to create two of the most avant-garde labels of the French electronic scene. In\ufb01n\u00e9 in 2006 with Alexandre Cazac and Yannick Matray, which discovered artists as adventurous as Rone and Aufgang, then the label Sapiens, which he has directed alone since 2016 and published as much original music as spoken words written by researchers and artists.\n\nIn 2006, a decisive new encounter with cinema arrives. Stunned by the power of \"Code 1026\", the Belgian director Olivier Van Hoofstadt and his producer Luc Besson ordered an original soundtrack from Agoria. From this adventure was born one of Agoria's most abrasive discs, but above all a friendship with Olivier Van Hoofstadt who in 2020 asked him to compose the soundtrack for \"Lucky\", the new crazy comedy from the director of \"Dikkenek\". Meanwhile, Agoria also wrote music for two documentaries by Jan Kounen, \"M\u00e8re Oc\u00e9an\" and \"Vape Wave\" in 2016, then in 2018 on the series\n\"The Show \u00bb.\n\nThe wealth of experiences that characterise Agoria lead him to collaborate with the fashion world, playing his music for the Italian brand Fendi in Milan, the city where he himself resided for several\nyears. He has also collaborated with the visual artist Philippe Parreno with whom he participated in the writing of the soundtrack for the immersive installation he created in 2016 for the Turbine Hall of the Tate Modern in London.\n\nBut it was during the last edition of Art Basel Miami Beach, one of the most important contemporary art fairs in the world, where Agoria, under his real name, was invited to present his work for the \ufb01rst time. His pieces, taking a new look at the principle of the lacerated posters dear to Jacques Villegl\u00e9, an essential \ufb01gure in \"New Realism\" of the 60s, were hailed by the famous American magazine \"Interior Design\" as one of the strong points of the '2019 edition.
