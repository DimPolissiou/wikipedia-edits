The experienced test pilot was told to execute a half roll if the Natter should veer off course. The start worked as planned, with Sieber executing the roll maneuvers as soon as the Natter changed its course. After the release of the [[solid fuel rocket]] boosters it could be seen that the [[Aircraft canopy|canopy]] came off and fell to the ground while the Natter disappeared into the clouds.\n\nEyewitnesses reported that the main engine kept firing. Soon, the Natter reappeared vertically from the clouds and hit the ground at high speed. All eyes searched for Sieber appearing with his parachute from the clouds, but to no avail.\n\n== Impact site ==\n\nAt the impact site, about 7&nbsp;km away, a 5&nbsp;m deep crater was found, and except for half of a left arm and half of a left leg, only small body parts were found\u2060\u200a\u2060\u2014\u2060\u200a\u2060and later a 14&nbsp;cm long part of a skull.\n\nIn 1998\u20131999, excavations found the remains of one of the ''Starthilfsraketen'' RATO rockets at the impact site, proving that it did not release from the fuselage of the Natter.\n\nLothar's remains are buried in a marked grave at [[Stetten am kalten Markt]].\n\n[[File:Grab Lothar Sieber, Stetten akM 03 10.jpg|thumb|Grave of Lothar Sieber in the cemetery at Stetten am kalten Markt; Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany]]\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\nReconstruction of the flight, which lasted 55 seconds and travelled a horizontal distance of 7&nbsp;km, calculated an [[average speed]] of about 800&nbsp;km/h, thus about 14&nbsp;km were traveled in total. \n\nThings went well at first, but one of the four jettisonable [[Schmidding]] boosters failed to release and the Natter went out of control. At 500 m (1,600&nbsp;ft) the cockpit canopy pulled off as Sieber intended to bail out. He was instructed by radio to keep trying to shake off the booster, but inside the clouds he lost orientation as he presumably did not rely on the automatic radio guiding system which was designed to lead Natters with inexperienced pilots to the altitudes at which Allied bombers operated. The Natter probably turned on its back and flew horizontally rather than climb, thus accelerating, which Sieber may have misinterpreted for a steep nose dive, pulling harder on the thrust rudder which made things even worse. Also, the brake parachute did not open due to the booster still being stuck. When the Natter left the clouds, Sieber likely noticed his situation and tried to bail out, but due to the high speed he managed only to get out with his left arm and leg before the violent impact.\n\nAs an experienced test pilot had failed to control the Natter, which was intended to be operated by many inexperienced pilots as an interceptor, the SS cancelled the project. The cause was officially explained as a failure of the canopy, which simply may have not been properly latched before launch.\n\nSieber's remains were buried with military honors on 3 March 1945.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Early human rocket flight efforts]]\n* [[Messerschmitt Me 163]]\n\n== Further reading ==\n*Horst Lommel: ''Der erste bemannte Raketenstart der Welt'', Motorbuch Verlag, 2.

After the 1991 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, the [[Earth Summit]], Singer started writing and speaking out to cast doubt on the science. He predicted disastrous economic damage from any restrictions on fossil fuel use, and argued that the natural world and its weather patterns are complex and ill-understood, and that little is known about the dynamics of heat exchange from the oceans to the atmosphere, or the role of clouds. As the scientific consensus grew, he continued to argue from a skeptical position.<ref name = \"scheuering2004\" /> He has repeatedly criticized the climate models that predict global warming. In 1994 he compared model results to observed temperatures and found that the predicted temperatures for 1950\u20131980 deviated from the temperatures that had actually occurred, from which he concluded in his regular column in ''The Washington Times''\u2014with the headline that day \"Climate Claims Wither under the Luminous Lights of Science\"\u2014that climate models are faulty.

When the report was released by the de Tocqueville institution as the first chapter of the report ''Science, Economics, and Environmental Policy: A Critical Examination'', Singer's credit was changed from lead author to \"reviewer\".\n* For the final version of the report, see [http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/documentStore/d/v/r/dvr49b00/Sdvr49b00.pdf \"Science, Economics, and Environmental Policy: A Critical Examination\"], Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, August 11, 1994, accessed Dec. 26 2012</ref> The report criticized the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) for their 1993 study about the cancer risks of passive smoking, calling it \"junk science\". Singer told [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]'s ''The Fifth Estate'' in 2006 that he stood by the position that the EPA had \"cooked the data\" to show that [[second-hand smoke]] causes lung cancer. CBC said that tobacco money had paid for Singer's research and for his promotion of it, and that it was organized by [[APCO Worldwide#The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition controversy|APCO]]. Singer told CBC it made no difference where the money came from. \"They don't carry a note on a dollar bill saying 'This comes from the tobacco industry,'\" he said. \"In any case I was not aware of it, and I didn't ask APCO where they get their money. That's not my business.\"<ref name=CBCsmoking /> In December 2010 he wrote in ''[[American Thinker]]'' that he is nonsmoker who finds [[second-hand smoke]] an unpleasant irritant that cannot be healthy; he also wrote that his father, a heavy smoker, died of [[emphysema]] when relatively young. According to Singer, he serves on the advisory board of an anti-smoking organization, and has never been paid by [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]] or the [[Tobacco politics|tobacco lobby]].<ref>Singer, S.

He told CBC: \"It was warmer a thousand years ago than it is today. Vikings settled Greenland. Is that good or bad? I think it's good. They grew wine in England, in northern England. I think that's good. At least some people think so.\"<ref>\"The Denial Machine,\" 20:10 mins.</ref> \"We are certainly putting more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,\" he told ''The Daily Telegraph'' in 2009. \"However there is no evidence that this high CO<sub>2</sub> is making a detectable difference. It should in principle, however the atmosphere is very complicated and one cannot simply argue that just because CO<sub>2</sub> is a greenhouse gas it causes warming.\"<ref name=\"Gray2009\" /> He believes that radical environmentalists are exaggerating the dangers. \"The underlying effort here seems to be to use global warming as an excuse to cut down the use of energy,\" he said. \"It's very simple: if you cut back the use of energy, then you cut back economic growth.

After the 1991 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, the [[Earth Summit]], Singer started writing and speaking out to cast doubt on the science. He predicted disastrous economic damage from any restrictions on fossil fuel use, and argued that the natural world and its weather patterns are complex and ill-understood, and that little is known about the dynamics of heat exchange from the oceans to the atmosphere, or the role of clouds. As the scientific consensus grew, he continued to argue from a skeptical position.<ref name = \"scheuering2004\" /> He has repeatedly criticized the climate models that predict global warming. In 1994 he compared model results to observed temperatures and found that the predicted temperatures for 1950\u20131980 deviated from the temperatures that had actually occurred, from which he concluded in his regular column in ''The Washington Times''\u2014with the headline that day \"Climate Claims Wither under the Luminous Lights of Science\"\u2014that climate models are faulty. In 2007 he collaborated on a study that found tropospheric temperature trends of \"Climate of the 20th Century\" models differed from satellite observations by twice the model mean uncertainty.<ref>Douglass, David H.; Christy, John R.; Pearson, Benjamin D.; Singer, S.

The meeting included Singer's group, the [[George C. Marshall Institute]], and ExxonMobil. Newsweek said that, according to an eight-page memo that was leaked, the meeting proposed a $5-million campaign to convince the public that the science of global warming was controversial and uncertain.

When adjustment was made for transient events the data showed a slight warming, and research suggested that the discrepancy between surface and satellite data was largely accounted for by problems such as instrument differences between satellites.<ref>Parson, Edward A., and Dessler, Andrew E.

The Kyoto Protocol was the result of an international convention held in Kyoto, Japan, during which several industrialized nations agreed to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Singer's declaration read: \"Energy is essential for economic growth ... We understand the motivation to eliminate what are perceived to be the driving forces behind a potential climate change; but we believe the Kyoto Protocol\u2014to curtail carbon dioxide emissions from only a part of the world community\u2014is dangerously simplistic, quite ineffective, and economically destructive to jobs and standards-of-living.\"<ref name = \"scheuering2004\" />\n\nScheuering writes that Singer circulated this in the United States and Europe and gathered 100 signatories, though she says some of the signatories' credentials were questioned.

The week after, a special law by the government enforced the measures to be taken against violence in football stadia and forbade the presence of supporters inside stadia which didn't agree with mandatory security dispositions, thus enabling Italian football to go on with half of the matches played without audience.\n\nFollowing the events, Catania was prohibited to play its home matches at Stadio Angelo Massimino for the remaining part of the season, and the club was also forced to play its home matches in neutral grounds without spectators (''a porte chiuse'', behind closed doors). Several other Italian stadia were closed too because of security reasons, and reopened only once they would have passed several safety requirements. All stadiums were successfully reopened for April, with Stadio Massimino's exception. Catania's home matches were successively allowed to be attended by spectators, yet on neutral ground, as from 13 May.\n\n===Dominant Inter===\nWith their victory over [[S.S. Robur Siena|Siena]] on 22 April 2007, [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]] captured the 2006\u201307 Serie A title (the 15th ''[[Scudetto]]'' in their club history) by moving 16 points clear of second-place [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] with five matches to play. Inter's dominant effort marked the defence of the title they were awarded in the wake of the ''Calciopoli'' scandal, and their first ''Scudetto'' claimed on the field since 28 May 1989.<ref name=\"inter1\">[http://www.channel4.com/sport/football_italia/sa0607/int-rom.html \"Inter-Roma match recap\"], ''Channel 4'', 18 April 2007.</ref> Clinching with five matches remaining, Inter tied the Serie A record for earliest title claim (along with [[Torino F.C.|Torino]] in the [[1947\u201348 Serie A]]). The team also broke the record for most consecutive wins with a 17 match winning streak.\n\n===Relegation battle===\nWith Messina and Ascoli already relegated, there was only one relegation slot left to be decided in the last matchday, with [[Parma F.C.|Parma]] (39 points), [[A.C. ChievoVerona|Chievo]] (39), [[Calcio Catania|Catania]] (38), Siena (37) and Reggina (37) involved in the battle. The key match in the relegation battle was widely expected to be Catania\u2013Chievo, to be played in [[Bologna]] because of the forced closure of Stadio Angelo Massimino by the [[Italian Football Federation]] (FIGC) following the February 2007 infamous riots in the Sicilian derby. The match ended in a 2\u20130 win for Catania; due to the contemporary wins of Parma, Siena and Reggina, Chievo were therefore relegated to Serie B.\n\n==Team details==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!

It was scheduled to begin on 26 and 27 August, but was postponed to 2 September 2006 due to the [[2006 Italian football scandal]], which led to the absence of [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]]. On 22 April 2007, [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]] became Serie A champions after defeating [[S.S. Robur Siena|Siena]], as [[A.S. Roma|Roma]]'s loss to [[Atalanta B.C.|Atalanta]] left Inter with a 16-point advantage with five matches to play.\n[[File:Serie A 2006-07 2.png|thumb|325px|right|2006\u201307 Serie A teams distribution]]\n\n==Events==\n\n===2006 Italian football scandal===\n{{main|2006 Italian football scandal}}\nFollowing the Serie A scandal of 2006, [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] was relegated to [[Serie B]] and deducted 9 points. [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]], [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] and [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]], were deducted 15, 8 and 3 points respectively but were not relegated. Consequently, [[U.S. Lecce|Lecce]], [[A.C.R. Messina|Messina]] and [[Treviso F.B.C. 1993|Treviso]], originally slated for relegation to Serie B, were retained in Serie A, but after [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]] and [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] we're not relegated result in relegation of [[U.S. Lecce|Lecce]] and [[Treviso F.B.C. 1993|Treviso]], thereby keeping the top table at 20 teams.\n\nAs part of another inquiry, [[Urbs Sportiva Reggina 1914|Reggina]] were handed a 15-point penalty but were allowed to remain in Serie A.<ref name=\"reggina3\">[http://www.theworldgame.com.au/home/index.php?pid=st&cid=74227 \"Reggina to stay in Serie A\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820101836/http://www.theworldgame.com.au/home/index.php?pid=st&cid=74227 |date=2006-08-20 }}, ''The World Game'', 18 August 2006.</ref> This penalty was reduced to 11 points on appeal.\n\n===League halting of February 2007===\n{{main|2007 Catania football violence}}\n\nOn 2 February 2007, police officer [[Filippo Raciti]] was killed outside the [[Stadio Angelo Massimino]], [[Catania]], in football-related violence during the [[Sicilian derby]] between rivals [[Calcio Catania|Catania]] and [[U.S. Citt\u00e0 di Palermo|Palermo]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/6326513.stm \"Italian league halted by violence\"].</ref> The match, originally scheduled for 4 February at 3pm, was exceptionally advanced on Friday at 6pm under request of Catania because of the simultaneity with the [[St. Agatha]] local celebrations.\n\nThe dramatic Sicilian derby events, which followed the murder of Ermanno Licursi, an amateur club manager, beaten to death during a riot in a [[Terza Categoria]] league match, led Commissioner [[Luca Pancalli]] to call a stop to all football matches in Italy, including Serie A fixtures. Pancalli noted how the league fixtures would not start again until a solution to the violence issue in Italian football is found. The week after, a special law by the government enforced the measures to be taken against violence in football stadia and forbade the presence of supporters inside stadia which didn't agree with mandatory security dispositions, thus enabling Italian football to go on with half of the matches played without audience.\n\nFollowing the events, Catania was prohibited to play its home matches at Stadio Angelo Massimino for the remaining part of the season, and the club was also forced to play its home matches in neutral grounds without spectators (''a porte chiuse'', behind closed doors). Several other Italian stadia were closed too because of security reasons, and reopened only once they would have passed several safety requirements. All stadiums were successfully reopened for April, with Stadio Massimino's exception. Catania's home matches were successively allowed to be attended by spectators, yet on neutral ground, as from 13 May.\n\n===Dominant Inter===\nWith their victory over [[S.S. Robur Siena|Siena]] on 22 April 2007, [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]] captured the 2006\u201307 Serie A title (the 15th ''[[Scudetto]]'' in their club history) by moving 16 points clear of second-place [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] with five matches to play. Inter's dominant effort marked the defence of the title they were awarded in the wake of the ''Calciopoli'' scandal, and their first ''Scudetto'' claimed on the field since 28 May 1989.<ref name=\"inter1\">[http://www.channel4.com/sport/football_italia/sa0607/int-rom.html \"Inter-Roma match recap\"], ''Channel 4'', 18 April 2007.</ref> Clinching with five matches remaining, Inter tied the Serie A record for earliest title claim (along with [[Torino F.C.|Torino]] in the [[1947\u201348 Serie A]]). The team also broke the record for most consecutive wins with a 17 match winning streak.\n\n===Relegation battle===\nWith Messina and Ascoli already relegated, there was only one relegation slot left to be decided in the last matchday, with [[Parma F.C.|Parma]] (39 points), [[A.C. ChievoVerona|Chievo]] (39), [[Calcio Catania|Catania]] (38), Siena (37) and Reggina (37) involved in the battle. The key match in the relegation battle was widely expected to be Catania\u2013Chievo, to be played in [[Bologna]] because of the forced closure of Stadio Angelo Massimino by the [[Italian Football Federation]] (FIGC) following the February 2007 infamous riots in the Sicilian derby. The match ended in a 2\u20130 win for Catania; due to the contemporary wins of Parma, Siena and Reggina, Chievo were therefore relegated to Serie B.\n\n==Team details==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!

{"title_page": "Autonetics", "text_new": "{{primary sources|date=April 2011}}\n\n'''Autonetics''' was a division of [[North American Aviation]] that produced various [[avionics]] but is best known for their [[inertial navigation system]]s used in submarines and [[intercontinental ballistic missiles]]. Its 188-acre facility in [[Anaheim, California]], with 36,000 employees, was the city's largest employer.<ref>Carpenter, Eric and French, Sally.  \"Huge monument honors aerospace workers,\" ''Orange County Register,'' Aug. 3, 2010.

A3.</ref>\n\n==Origin==\nAutonetics originated in North American Aviation's Technical Research Laboratory, a small unit in the Los Angeles Division's engineering department, in 1945. In 1946, the laboratory won an [[Army Air Forces]] contract to develop a 175 to 500 mile range glide missile. The work and the lab expanded, and by June 1948, all of the Aerophysics Laboratory was consolidated at [[Downey, California]]. The evolution of the [[SM-64 Navaho|Navaho]] missile program then resulted in the establishment of Autonetics as a separate division of North American Aviation in 1955, first located in Downey, moving to [[Anaheim, California]] in 1963.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boeing.com/history/narrative/n051naa.html |title=North American Aviation ...

One of the automatic navigation systems produced by the division was the '''N-6''' or NAVAN (North American Vehicle Auto Navigation) for the Navaho missile system. Other products included alignment devices and attitude reference systems for missile launchers, artillery, land survey, aircraft and missile-range ships.\n\nThe '''Electro Sensor Systems''' division built multi-function radar systems, armament control computers, data and information display systems for high performance aircraft, and sensor equipment. The radar systems included the '''R-14''' and '''F-15''', which were multimode, [[Monopulse radar|monopulse]] systems. This family of radars was termed NASARR (North American Search And Ranging Radar). The R-14 system was installed in the USAF [[Republic F-105 Thunderchief|F-105 Thunderchief]] and the more advanced F-15 system with [[Terrain-following radar|Terrain Following]] capabilities was developed for the USAF [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter|F-104 Starfighter]] which were also used by NATO, MAP, and the Canadian Air Force. Both radar systems allowed [[Time On Target]] (ToT) impact control capability with a high degree of accuracy. The R-14 and F-15 systems used (pre-solid state) electronic vacuum tubes in their designs. Both systems were developed, built and tested at the Downey (Slauson Avenue), and Anaheim facilities.\n\nThe '''Data Systems''' division developed data-processing systems, general-purpose digital computers, ground support equipment, control systems and telemetry systems.\n\nAutonetics built an office computer system (RECOMP), and was responsible for the guidance and control system for the Boeing-built [[LGM-30 Minuteman|Minuteman]] missiles. The division ultimately produced the Monica family of microcomputers, the [[D-17B]] Minuteman I computer, and the D-37B<ref>\n {{cite web\n |url = http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1964/1964%20-%200474.html\n |title = FLIGHT International, 20 February 1964, p289 Article \"Digital Computers for Aircraft\"\n |publisher = Flight Global Archive\n |accessdate = June 6, 2011\n }}</ref> and [[D-37C]] Minuteman II computers, in which micro-miniaturization reduced weight by two-thirds.  Autonetics also developed and tested flight programs for the [[D37D]] Minuteman III computer.\n\nThe 1966 Autonetics [[DDA integrator]] was the first MOS large scale array (LSA) using [[four-phase logic]]. After producing the DDA and other MOS-LSA circuits, the team involved decided to design a general purpose computer suitable for navigation (sometimes called the MOS GP computer). The [[Autonetics D200]] computer was built using MOS LSAs.\n<ref>\nC. F.

Its 188-acre facility in [[Anaheim, California]], with 36,000 employees, was the city's largest employer.<ref>Carpenter, Eric and French, Sally.  \"Huge monument honors aerospace workers,\" ''Orange County Register,'' Aug. 3, 2010.

A3.</ref>\n\n==Origin==\nAutonetics originated in North American Aviation's Technical Research Laboratory, a small unit in the Los Angeles Division's engineering department, in 1945. In 1946, the laboratory won an [[Army Air Forces]] contract to develop a 175 to 500 mile range glide missile. The work and the lab expanded, and by June 1948, all of the Aerophysics Laboratory was consolidated at [[Downey, California]]. The evolution of the [[SM-64 Navaho|Navaho]] missile program then resulted in the establishment of Autonetics as a separate division of North American Aviation in 1955, first located in Downey, moving to [[Anaheim, California]] in 1963.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boeing.com/history/narrative/n051naa.html |title=North American Aviation ...

One of the automatic navigation systems produced by the division was the '''N-6''' or NAVAN (North American Vehicle Auto Navigation) for the Navaho missile system. Other products included alignment devices and attitude reference systems for missile launchers, artillery, land survey, aircraft and missile-range ships.\n\nThe '''Electro Sensor Systems''' division built multi-function radar systems, armament control computers, data and information display systems for high performance aircraft, and sensor equipment. The radar systems included the '''R-14''' and '''F-15''', which were multimode, [[Monopulse radar|monopulse]] systems. This family of radars was termed NASARR (North American Search And Ranging Radar). The R-14 system was installed in the USAF [[Republic F-105 Thunderchief|F-105 Thunderchief]] and the more advanced F-15 system with [[Terrain-following radar|Terrain Following]] capabilities was developed for the USAF [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter|F-104 Starfighter]] which were also used by NATO, MAP, and the Canadian Air Force. Both radar systems allowed [[Time On Target]] (ToT) impact control capability with a high degree of accuracy. The R-14 and F-15 systems used (pre-solid state) electronic vacuum tubes in their designs. Both systems were developed, built and tested at the Downey (Slauson Avenue), and Anaheim facilities.\n\nThe '''Data Systems''' division developed data-processing systems, general-purpose digital computers, ground support equipment, control systems and telemetry systems.\n\nAutonetics built an office computer system (RECOMP), and was responsible for the guidance and control system for the Boeing-built [[LGM-30 Minuteman|Minuteman]] missiles. The division ultimately produced the Monica family of microcomputers, the [[D-17B]] Minuteman I computer, and the D-37B<ref>\n {{cite web\n |url = http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1964/1964%20-%200474.html\n |title = FLIGHT International, 20 February 1964, p289 Article \"Digital Computers for Aircraft\"\n |publisher = Flight Global Archive\n |accessdate = June 6, 2011\n }}</ref> and [[D-37C]] Minuteman II computers, in which micro-miniaturization reduced weight by two-thirds.  Autonetics also developed and tested flight programs for the [[D37D]] Minuteman III computer.\n\nThe 1966 Autonetics [[DDA integrator]] was the first MOS large scale array (LSA) using [[four-phase logic]]. After producing the DDA and other MOS-LSA circuits, the team involved decided to design a general purpose computer suitable for navigation (sometimes called the MOS GP computer). The [[Autonetics D200]] computer was built using MOS LSAs.\n<ref>\nC. F.

Due to its high concentration in [[phagocytes]], azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma due to [[ion trapping]] and its high lipid solubility.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days.<ref name=\"drugs.com\">{{cite web |url=https://www.drugs.com/pro/zithromax.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-10 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014005118/http://www.drugs.com/pro/zithromax.html |archivedate=2014-10-14 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing a single dose of 500&nbsp;mg, the apparent terminal elimination half-life of azithromycin is 68 hours.<ref name=\"drugs.com\"/> [[bilirubin|Biliary]] excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination.

Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected.<ref name=USlabel2016/>\n\n=== Pharmacokinetics ===\nAzithromycin is an acid-stable antibiotic, so it can be taken orally with no need of protection from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed, but absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration (T<sub>max</sub>) in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to its high concentration in [[phagocytes]], azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma due to [[ion trapping]] and its high lipid solubility.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days.<ref name=\"drugs.com\">{{cite web |url=https://www.drugs.com/pro/zithromax.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-10 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014005118/http://www.drugs.com/pro/zithromax.html |archivedate=2014-10-14 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing a single dose of 500&nbsp;mg, the apparent terminal elimination half-life of azithromycin is 68 hours.<ref name=\"drugs.com\"/> [[bilirubin|Biliary]] excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination.

The successor to the 1983 arcade game, ''[[Mario Bros.]]'', it was released in Japan in 1985 for the [[Famicom]], and in North America and Europe for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) in 1985 and 1987 respectively. Players control [[Mario]], or his brother [[Luigi]] in the multiplayer mode, as they travel the [[Mushroom Kingdom]] to rescue [[Princess Toadstool]] from [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]]. They must traverse [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] stages while avoiding hazards such as enemies and pits with the aid of [[power-up]]s such as the Super Mushroom, Fire Flower, and Starman.\n\nThe game was designed by [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] and [[Takashi Tezuka]] as \"a grand culmination\" of the Famicom team's three years of game mechanics and programming. The design of the first level, [[World 1-1]], serves as a [[Tutorial (video gaming)|tutorial]] for first-time video gamers on the basic [[game mechanics|mechanics]] of [[platform game]]play. The aggressively size-optimized profile was intended as a [[Parting phrase|farewell]] to the Famicom's [[Game cartridge|cartridge]] medium in favor of the forthcoming [[Famicom Disk System]], whose floppy disks temporarily became the dominant distribution medium for a few years.\n\n''Super Mario Bros.'' is frequently cited as one of the [[greatest video games of all time]], with praise on its precise controls. It is one of the [[bestselling games of all time]], with more than 40 million physical copies. It is credited alongside the NES as one of the key factors in reviving the video game industry after the [[Video game crash of 1983|1983 crash]], and helped popularize the side-scrolling platform game genre. [[Koji Kondo]]'s [[Super Mario Bros. theme|soundtrack]] is one of the earliest and most popular in video games, making music into a centerpiece of game design. The game inspired an [[Mario (franchise)|expansive franchise]] including a long-running [[Super Mario (series)|game series]], an [[The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!|animated television series]], and a [[Super Mario Bros. (film)|feature film]]. Re-releases and cameos of the game are on most of Nintendo's following systems. Alongside Mario himself, ''Super Mario Bros.'' has become prominent in [[popular culture]].\n\n{{toc limit|limit=3}}\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:NES Super Mario Bros.png|thumb|left|''Super Mario Bros.'' features various unique power-ups which assist Mario. In the above picture, Mario wields a [[Fire Flower]], allowing him to attack enemies with fire projectiles. Behind Mario is an [[starman (Mario)|invincibility star]], which allows him to defeat enemies on contact and withstand other hazards for a short period of time.|alt=Refer to caption]]\n\nIn ''Super Mario Bros.'', the player takes on the role of [[Mario]], the protagonist of [[Mario (franchise)|the series]]. Mario's younger brother, [[Luigi]], is controlled by the second player in the game's [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] mode and assumes the same plot role and functionality as Mario. The objective is to race through the Mushroom Kingdom, survive the main antagonist Bowser's forces, and save Princess Toadstool.<ref name=\"Super Mario Bros. instruction booklet\" />{{rp|7}} The game is a [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[platform game|platformer]]; the player moves from the left side of the screen to the right side in order to reach the flag pole at the end of each level.\n\nThe game world features coins scattered around for Mario to collect and special bricks marked with a question mark (''?''), which when hit from below by Mario may reveal more coins or a special item. Other \"secret\", often invisible, bricks may contain more coins or rare items. If the player gains a [[Super Mushroom]], Mario grows to double his size and gains the ability to break bricks above him. If Mario gets hit in this mode, then instead of dying he turns back to regular Mario.<ref name=\"Super Mario Bros. instruction booklet\" />{{rp|12}} Players start with a certain number of [[life (gaming)|lives]] and may gain [[Extra life|additional lives]] by picking up green spotted orange [[1 up mushroom|1-Up mushrooms]] hidden in bricks, or by collecting 100 coins, defeating several enemies in a row with a Koopa shell, or bouncing on enemies successively without touching the ground. Mario loses a life if he takes damage while small, falls in a bottomless pit, or [[Time limit (video gaming)|runs out of time]]. The game ends when the player runs out of lives, although a button input can be used on the game over screen to continue from the first level of the world in which the player died.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.polygon.com/2015/1/26/7908265/super-mario-bros-continue-cheat-code |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 22, 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180222225911/https://www.polygon.com/2015/1/26/7908265/super-mario-bros-continue-cheat-code |archivedate=February 22, 2018 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nMario's primary attack is jumping on top of enemies, though many enemies have differing responses to this. For example, a [[Goomba]] will flatten and be defeated,<ref name=\"Super Mario Bros. instruction booklet\" />{{rp|12}} while a [[Koopa Troopa]] will temporarily retract into its shell, allowing Mario to use it as a projectile.<ref name=\"Super Mario Bros. instruction booklet\" />{{rp|11}} These shells may be deflected off a wall to destroy other enemies, though they can also bounce back against Mario, which will hurt or kill him.<ref name=\"Super Mario Bros. instruction booklet\" />{{rp|19}} Other enemies, such as underwater foes and enemies with spiked tops, cannot be jumped on and damage the player instead.  Mario can also defeat enemies above him by jumping to hit the brick that the enemy is standing on. Mario may also acquire the [[Fire flower|Fire Flower]] from certain \"?\" blocks that when picked up changes the color of Super Mario's outfit and allows him to throw fireballs. However, certain enemies such as Buzzy Beetles are immune to fireballs. A less common item is the [[Super Mario#Invincibility|Starman]], which often appears when Mario hits certain concealed or otherwise invisible blocks. This item makes Mario temporarily [[Invincibility (video gaming)|invincible]] to most hazards and capable of defeating enemies on contact.<ref name=\"Super Mario Bros. instruction booklet\" />{{rp|10}}\n\nThe game consists of eight worlds with four sub-levels called \"stages\" in each world.\"<ref name=\"IGN VC\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/03/06/super-mario-bros-vc-review |title=Super Mario Bros.

Bowser and his decoys are defeated by jumping over them and reaching the axe on the end of the bridge, although they can also be defeated using a Fire Flower. The game also includes some stages taking place underwater, which contain different enemies. In addition, there are bonuses and secret areas in the game. Most secret areas contain more coins for Mario to collect, but some contain \"warp pipes\" that allow Mario to advance directly to later worlds in the game without completing the intervening stages. After completing the game once, the player is rewarded with the ability to replay the game with changes made to increase its difficulty, such as all Goombas in the game being replaced with Buzzy Beetles.<ref name=\"allgame\">{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Geoffrey Douglas |title=Super Mario Bros \u2013 Review |website=[[Allgame]] |accessdate=December 6, 2012 |url=http://allgame.com/game.php?id=1320&tab=review |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141114120755/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=1320&tab=review |archivedate=November 14, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\nIn the fantasy setting of the [[Mushroom Kingdom]], a tribe of turtle-like creatures known as the [[Koopa Troopa]]s invade the kingdom and uses the magic of its king, [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]], to turn its inhabitants, known as the Mushroom People, into inanimate objects such as bricks, stones and horsehair plants.

Then they decided it would be fun to let Mario change his size via a [[power-up]]. The early level design was focused on teaching players that mushrooms were distinct from Goombas and would be beneficial to them, so in [[World 1-1|the first level of the game]], the first mushroom is difficult to avoid if it is released.<ref>{{cite web |title=Letting Everyone Know It Was A Good Mushroom |url=http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/wii/nsmb/0/3 |work=Iwata Asks: New Super Mario Bros Wii |publisher=Nintendo |accessdate=December 5, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927194716/http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/wii/nsmb/0/3 |archivedate=September 27, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The use of mushrooms to change size was influenced by common Japanese folktales in which people wander into forests and eat magical mushrooms; this also resulted in the game world being named the \"Mushroom Kingdom\".

This stage's map is identical to worlds 2-2 and 7-2, and upon entering the warp pipe at the end, the player is taken back to the start of the level, thus trapping the player in the level until all lives have been lost.

World -2 is an identical copy of World 7-3, and World -3 is a copy of World 4-4 with an underground level color palette and underground level music, and does not loop if the player takes the wrong path, contrary to the original World 4-4.

Two of these sequels, ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', were direct sequels to the game and were released for the NES, experiencing similar levels of commercial success. A different sequel, also titled ''Super Mario Bros. 2'', was released for the [[Famicom Disk System]] in 1986 exclusively in Japan, and was later released elsewhere as a part of ''[[Super Mario All-Stars]]'' under the name ''[[Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels]]''. The gameplay concepts and elements established in ''Super Mario Bros.'' are prevalent in nearly every ''Super Mario'' game. The series consists of over 15 entries; at least one ''Super Mario'' game has been released on nearly every Nintendo console to date. ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' is widely considered one of the greatest games ever made, and is largely credited with revolutionizing the platforming genre of video games and its step from 2D to 3D.

The successor to the 1983 arcade game, ''[[Mario Bros.]]'', it was released in Japan in 1985 for the [[Famicom]], and in North America and Europe for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) in 1985 and 1987 respectively. Players control [[Mario]], or his brother [[Luigi]] in the multiplayer mode, as they travel the [[Mushroom Kingdom]] to rescue [[Princess Toadstool]] from [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]]. They must traverse [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] stages while avoiding hazards such as enemies and pits with the aid of [[power-up]]s such as the Super Mushroom, Fire Flower, and Starman.\n\nThe game was designed by [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] and [[Takashi Tezuka]] as \"a grand culmination\" of the Famicom team's three years of game mechanics and programming. The design of the first level, [[World 1-1]], serves as a [[Tutorial (video gaming)|tutorial]] for first-time video gamers on the basic [[game mechanics|mechanics]] of [[platform game]]play. The aggressively size-optimized profile was intended as a [[Parting phrase|farewell]] to the Famicom's [[Game cartridge|cartridge]] medium in favor of the forthcoming [[Famicom Disk System]], whose floppy disks temporarily became the dominant distribution medium for a few years.\n\n''Super Mario Bros.'' is frequently cited as one of the [[greatest video games of all time]], with praise on its precise controls. It is one of the [[bestselling games of all time]], with more than 40 million physical copies. It is credited alongside the NES as one of the key factors in reviving the video game industry after the [[Video game crash of 1983|1983 crash]], and helped popularize the side-scrolling platform game genre. [[Koji Kondo]]'s [[Super Mario Bros. theme|soundtrack]] is one of the earliest and most popular in video games, making music into a centerpiece of game design. The game inspired an [[Mario (franchise)|expansive franchise]] including a long-running [[Super Mario (series)|game series]], an [[The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!|animated television series]], and a [[Super Mario Bros. (film)|feature film]]. Re-releases and cameos of the game are on most of Nintendo's following systems. Alongside Mario himself, ''Super Mario Bros.'' has become prominent in [[popular culture]].\n\n{{toc limit|limit=3}}\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:NES Super Mario Bros.png|thumb|left|''Super Mario Bros.'' features various unique power-ups which assist Mario. In the above picture, Mario wields a [[Fire Flower]], allowing him to attack enemies with fire projectiles. Behind Mario is an [[starman (Mario)|invincibility star]], which allows him to defeat enemies on contact and withstand other hazards for a short period of time.|alt=Refer to caption]]\n\nIn ''Super Mario Bros.'', the player takes on the role of [[Mario]], the protagonist of [[Mario (franchise)|the series]]. Mario's younger brother, [[Luigi]], is controlled by the second player in the game's [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] mode and assumes the same plot role and functionality as Mario. The objective is to race through the Mushroom Kingdom, survive the main antagonist Bowser's forces, and save Princess Toadstool.<ref name=\"Super Mario Bros. instruction booklet\" />{{rp|7}} The game is a [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[platform game|platformer]]; the player moves from the left side of the screen to the right side in order to reach the flag pole at the end of each level.\n\nThe game world features coins scattered around for Mario to collect and special bricks marked with a question mark (''?''), which when hit from below by Mario may reveal more coins or a special item. Other \"secret\", often invisible, bricks may contain more coins or rare items. If the player gains a [[Super Mushroom]], Mario grows to double his size and gains the ability to break bricks above him. If Mario gets hit in this mode, then instead of dying he turns back to regular Mario.<ref name=\"Super Mario Bros. instruction booklet\" />{{rp|12}} Players start with a certain number of [[life (gaming)|lives]] and may gain [[Extra life|additional lives]] by picking up green spotted orange [[1 up mushroom|1-Up mushrooms]] hidden in bricks, or by collecting 100 coins, defeating several enemies in a row with a Koopa shell, or bouncing on enemies successively without touching the ground. Mario loses a life if he takes damage while small, falls in a bottomless pit, or [[Time limit (video gaming)|runs out of time]]. The game ends when the player runs out of lives, although a button input can be used on the game over screen to continue from the first level of the world in which the player died.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.polygon.com/2015/1/26/7908265/super-mario-bros-continue-cheat-code |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 22, 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180222225911/https://www.polygon.com/2015/1/26/7908265/super-mario-bros-continue-cheat-code |archivedate=February 22, 2018 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nMario's primary attack is jumping on top of enemies, though many enemies have differing responses to this. For example, a [[Goomba]] will flatten and be defeated,<ref name=\"Super Mario Bros. instruction booklet\" />{{rp|12}} while a [[Koopa Troopa]] will temporarily retract into its shell, allowing Mario to use it as a projectile.<ref name=\"Super Mario Bros. instruction booklet\" />{{rp|11}} These shells may be deflected off a wall to destroy other enemies, though they can also bounce back against Mario, which will hurt or kill him.<ref name=\"Super Mario Bros. instruction booklet\" />{{rp|19}} Other enemies, such as underwater foes and enemies with spiked tops, cannot be jumped on and damage the player instead.  Mario can also defeat enemies above him by jumping to hit the brick that the enemy is standing on. Mario may also acquire the [[Fire flower|Fire Flower]] from certain \"?\" blocks that when picked up changes the color of Super Mario's outfit and allows him to throw fireballs. However, certain enemies such as Buzzy Beetles are immune to fireballs. A less common item is the [[Super Mario#Invincibility|Starman]], which often appears when Mario hits certain concealed or otherwise invisible blocks. This item makes Mario temporarily [[Invincibility (video gaming)|invincible]] to most hazards and capable of defeating enemies on contact.<ref name=\"Super Mario Bros. instruction booklet\" />{{rp|10}}\n\nThe game consists of eight worlds with four sub-levels called \"stages\" in each world.\"<ref name=\"IGN VC\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/03/06/super-mario-bros-vc-review |title=Super Mario Bros.

Bowser and his decoys are defeated by jumping over them and reaching the axe on the end of the bridge, although they can also be defeated using a Fire Flower. The game also includes some stages taking place underwater, which contain different enemies. In addition, there are bonuses and secret areas in the game. Most secret areas contain more coins for Mario to collect, but some contain \"warp pipes\" that allow Mario to advance directly to later worlds in the game without completing the intervening stages. After completing the game once, the player is rewarded with the ability to replay the game with changes made to increase its difficulty, such as all Goombas in the game being replaced with Buzzy Beetles.<ref name=\"allgame\">{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Geoffrey Douglas |title=Super Mario Bros \u2013 Review |website=[[Allgame]] |accessdate=December 6, 2012 |url=http://allgame.com/game.php?id=1320&tab=review |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141114120755/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=1320&tab=review |archivedate=November 14, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\nIn the fantasy setting of the [[Mushroom Kingdom]], a tribe of turtle-like creatures known as the [[Koopa Troopa]]s invade the kingdom and uses the magic of its king, [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]], to turn its inhabitants, known as the Mushroom People, into inanimate objects such as bricks, stones and horsehair plants.

Then they decided it would be fun to let Mario change his size via a [[power-up]]. The early level design was focused on teaching players that mushrooms were distinct from Goombas and would be beneficial to them, so in [[World 1-1|the first level of the game]], the first mushroom is difficult to avoid if it is released.<ref>{{cite web |title=Letting Everyone Know It Was A Good Mushroom |url=http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/wii/nsmb/0/3 |work=Iwata Asks: New Super Mario Bros Wii |publisher=Nintendo |accessdate=December 5, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927194716/http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/wii/nsmb/0/3 |archivedate=September 27, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The use of mushrooms to change size was influenced by common Japanese folktales in which people wander into forests and eat magical mushrooms; this also resulted in the game world being named the \"Mushroom Kingdom\".

This stage's map is identical to worlds 2-2 and 7-2, and upon entering the warp pipe at the end, the player is taken back to the start of the level, thus trapping the player in the level until all lives have been lost.

World -2 is an identical copy of World 7-3, and World -3 is a copy of World 4-4 with an underground level color palette and underground level music, and does not loop if the player takes the wrong path, contrary to the original World 4-4.

Two of these sequels, ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', were direct sequels to the game and were released for the NES, experiencing similar levels of commercial success. A different sequel, also titled ''Super Mario Bros. 2'', was released for the [[Famicom Disk System]] in 1986 exclusively in Japan, and was later released elsewhere as a part of ''[[Super Mario All-Stars]]'' under the name ''[[Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels]]''. The gameplay concepts and elements established in ''Super Mario Bros.'' are prevalent in nearly every ''Super Mario'' game. The series consists of over 15 entries; at least one ''Super Mario'' game has been released on nearly every Nintendo console to date. ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' is widely considered one of the greatest games ever made, and is largely credited with revolutionizing the platforming genre of video games and its step from 2D to 3D.
