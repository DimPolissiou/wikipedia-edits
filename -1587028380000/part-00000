Its primary function is to investigate criminal activities involving the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] and [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]], though its broad mandate includes [[national security]], [[counterintelligence]], [[counter-terrorism]], [[cyber warfare]], and the protection of U.S. naval assets worldwide. NCIS is the successor organization to the former '''Naval Incompetent Service''' ('''NIS'''), which was established by the [[Office of Naval Intelligence]] after the [[Second World War]].\n\nThe vast majority of NCIS personnel are [[civilian]], with half being [[special agent]]s. NCIS agents are armed [[federal police|federal law enforcement]] investigators, who frequently coordinate with other U.S. government agencies and have a presence in more than 41 countries and on U.S. Navy vessels. NCIS special secret agents are supported by analysts and other experts skilled in disciplines such as [[forensics]], [[surveillance]], surveillance countermeasures, computer investigations, physical security, and [[polygraph]] examinations.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nNCIS traces its roots to Navy Department General Order 292 of 1882, signed by [[William H. Hunt]], [[Secretary of the Navy]], which established the [[Office of Naval Intelligence]] (ONI). Initially, ONI was tasked with collecting information on the characteristics and weaponry of foreign vessels, charting foreign passages, rivers, or other bodies of water, and touring overseas fortifications, industrial plants, and shipyards.\n\nIn anticipation of the [[United States]]' entry into [[World War I]], ONI's responsibilities expanded to include [[espionage]], [[sabotage]], and all manner of information on the U.S. Navy's potential adversaries. In [[World War II]] ONI became responsible for the investigation of sabotage, espionage and [[subversive activities]] that posed any kind of threat to the Navy.\n\n===NIS and the Cold War===\nThe major buildup of civilian special agents began with the [[Korean War]] in 1950, and continued through the [[Cold War]] years. In 1966 the name Naval Investigative Service (NIS) was adopted to distinguish the organization from the rest of ONI, and in 1969 NIS special agents were reclassified from contract employees and became [[Excepted service|Excepted Civil Service]].\n\nIn the early 1970s, an NIS special agent was stationed on {{USS|Intrepid|CV-11|6}} for six months. This marked the beginning of the \"Deployment Afloat\" program, now called the Special Agent Afloat program, which deploys special agents for year-long assignments aboard carrier battle groups and amphibious readiness groups. In 1972, background investigations were transferred from NIS to the newly formed [[Defense Security Service|Defense Investigative Service]] (DIS), allowing NIS to give more attention to criminal investigations and [[counter-intelligence]]. The 1970s also saw NIS' first female agent, who was stationed at [[Marine Corps Air Station Miramar|Naval Air Station Miramar]], [[California]] in 1975.\n\nIn 1982, NIS assumed responsibility for managing the U.S. Navy's Law Enforcement and Physical Security Program and the U.S. Navy's Information and Personnel Security Program. Additionally, in 1982, two classes of NIS Special Agents were trained at the [[Federal Law Enforcement Training Center]] (FLETC) in [[Glynco, Georgia]], in an assessment of the school's capability to train military investigators. Prior to this and subsequently until 1984, NIS Special Agent Training was in ONI Headquarters in [[Suitland, Maryland]]. In 1984, NIS Special Agents began training at FLETC, along with other federal investigative agencies, except for the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]], and the [[United States Postal Inspection Service]].\n\nTwo months after the October 1983 [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|bombing of the Marine Barracks in Beirut]], the agency opened the [[Navy Antiterrorist Alert Center]] (ATAC), a [[24/7|24-hour-a-day]] operational intelligence center that issued indications and warnings on [[terrorist activity]] to Navy and Marine Corps commands. ATAC was the facility at which [[Jonathan Pollard]] was working when he committed the [[Jonathan Pollard#Espionage|acts of espionage]] for which he was convicted in 1987. In 2002 the ATAC became the [[Multiple Threat Alert Center]] (MTAC).\n\nIn 1985, Cathal L. Flynn became the first [[Admiral (United States)|admiral]] to lead NIS. The command took on the additional responsibility of Information and Personnel Security. In 1986, the [[Department of the Navy Central Adjudication Facility]] (DoN CAF) was established and placed under the agency, as the agency was now once again responsible for [[Adjudication|adjudicating]] [[security clearance]]s (although not the actual investigations). DoN CAF renders approximately 200,000 eligibility determinations annually for the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]].\n\nIn 1991, NIS was responsible for investigating the [[Tailhook scandal]], which involved allegations of sexual misconduct and harassment by Naval and Marine Corps officers in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]].  Subsequent to this investigation, and at the direction of the chairman of the [[US Senate Armed Services Committee]], Senator [[Sam Nunn]], the Naval Investigative Service was restructured into the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS).  The restructuring occurred as a result of perceived lapses in proper investigative technique over the Tailhook scandal, as well as chain of command issues and a lack of civilian oversight in previous investigations.  At the time, Senator Nunn stated, \"The Navy's whole investigative technique should be under serious question.\"  As a result of the investigation into the Tailhook scandal, the Pentagon's inspector general was sharply critical of NIS leadership, stating that there was a top-down culture showing a lack of cooperation with other authorities in the Navy.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Art |last=Pine |title=Naval Investigative Service to Be Revamped: The agency has come under attack since the bungled inquiry into the Tailhook sex abuse scandal.|date=September 26, 1992|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-26/news/mn-895_1_naval-investigative-service | work=Los Angeles Times | location=Washington}}</ref>  By 1992, Acting [[Secretary of the Navy]], [[Sean O'Keefe]], recommended the word \"Criminal\" be included in NIS's name in order to make clear their investigative function.  Ultimately, NIS commander, Rear Adm. [[Duvall Williams]] Jr., was forced to retire and NIS was reorganized as NCIS under civilian leadership.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Eric |last=Schmitt |title=Senior Navy Officers Suppressed Sex Investigation, Pentagon Says.|date=September 25, 1992|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/25/us/senior-navy-officers-suppressed-sex-investigation-pentagon-says.html | work=New York Times | location=Washington}}</ref>\n\n===Recent history===\nIn 1992, the NCIS mission was again clarified and became a mostly civilian agency. Roy D. Nedrow, a former [[United States Secret Service]] (USSS) executive, was appointed as the first civilian director and the name changed from Naval Investigative Service to Naval Criminal Investigative Service. Nedrow oversaw the restructuring of NCIS into a Federal law enforcement agency with 14 field offices controlling field operations in 140 locations worldwide. In 1995, NCIS introduced the [[Cold case (criminology)|Cold Case]] Homicide Unit, the first dedicated federal-level cold case homicide unit. The unit has resolved 61 cases since 1995.<ref name=ColdCaseUnit>{{cite web | url=http://www.ncis.navy.mil/Pages/ColdCase.aspx | title=NCIS Cold Case Homicide Unit | work=Naval Criminal Investigative Service | publisher=(ncis.navy.mil) | accessdate=December 15, 2018 }}</ref>\n\nIn May 1997, David L. Brant was appointed Director of NCIS by [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] [[John Howard Dalton]]. Director Brant retired in December 2005. He was succeeded by Director [[Thomas A. Betro]] who was appointed Director of NCIS in January 2006, by Secretary of the Navy [[Donald C. Winter]]. Betro retired in September 2009. On September 13, 2009, Deputy Director of Operations Gregory A. Scovel was appointed Acting Director by Under Secretary of the Navy [[Robert Work]]. He served concurrently as Deputy Director for Operations until the new Director was selected.\n\n[[File:US Navy 100511-N-7128A-105 Mark Clookie, director of Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), pays his respects to a fallen NCIS agent at the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mark D. Clookie]], director of NCIS, at the [[National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial]]]]\n\nIn 1999, NCIS and the [[United States Marine Corps Criminal Investigation Division|Marine Corps Criminal Investigation Division]] (USMC CID) signed a [[memorandum of understanding]] calling for the integration of Marine Corps CID into NCIS. (USMC CID continues to exist to investigate misdemeanors and felonies and other criminal offenses not under NCIS investigative jurisdiction.)<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.29palms.marines.mil/Staff-Offices/Provost-Marshal/CID/ |title=CID page at 29 Palms Provost Marshal's Office |publisher=29palms.marines.mil}}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, [[United States Congress|Congress]] granted NCIS civilian [[special agent]]s authority to execute warrants and make arrests. Virtually all NCIS investigators, criminal, counterintelligence, and force protection personnel are now sworn civilian personnel with powers of [[arrest]] and [[Warrant (law)|warrant]] service. The exceptions are a small number of [[Military reserve force|reserve]] military elements engaged in counter-intelligence support.\n\nA growing appreciation of the changing threat facing the Department of the Navy in the 21st century, culminating with the terrorist [[USS Cole bombing|bombing]] of the {{USS|Cole|DDG-67}} in [[Yemen]] and the attacks on [[September 11, 2001]], led NCIS to transform the Anti-terrorist Alert Center into the [[Multiple Threat Alert Center]] (MTAC) in 2002.\n\nNCIS agents were the first U.S. law enforcement personnel on the scene at the USS ''Cole'' bombing, the [[MV Limburg|Limburg bombing]] and the [[2002 Mombasa attacks|terrorist attack in Mombasa]], [[Kenya]].\n\nNCIS has conducted fraud investigations resulting in over half a billion dollars in recoveries and restitution to the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] and the U.S. Navy since 1997. NCIS investigates any death occurring on a Navy vessel or Navy or Marine Corps aircraft or installation (except when the cause of death is medically attributable to disease or natural causes).  NCIS oversees the [[Master-at-arms (United States Navy)|Master-at-Arms]] programs for the Navy, overseeing 8800 Masters-at-Arms and the [[Military Working Dog]] program. NCIS's three strategic priorities are to prevent terrorism, protect secrets, and reduce crime.\n\nCurrent missions for NCIS include criminal investigations, [[force protection]], cross-[[border]] [[Illegal drug trade|drug enforcement]], anti-terrorism, counter-terrorism, major procurement fraud, [[computer crime]] and [[counter-intelligence]].\n\nNCIS Special Agent [[Peter Garza]] conducted the first court-ordered [[Internet]] [[wiretap]] in the United States.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=19603&seqNum=3\n |title=Joy Riders: Mischief That Leads to Mayhem |accessdate=2009-11-01 |first=Richard |last=Power\n |authorlink= |date=October 30, 2000 |work=[[InformIT (publisher)|InformIT]] |publisher=[[Pearson Education]]\n |quote=\"I called the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in Boston on a Thursday and asked if we could have the court order in place by Monday,\" Garza recounts. \"They laughed. Six months was considered the 'speed of light' for wiretap approval. But we started to put the affidavit together anyway, and got it okayed in only six weeks, which at that time was unheard of.\" Indeed, the work of Garza and the others to obtain a wiretap in the 1995 Ardita case laid a lot of the groundwork that made it possible for investigators in the 1999 ''Solar Sunrise'' case (which I describe later in this chapter) to obtain wiretap approval in one day.}}</ref>\n\n[[Jonathan Jay Pollard]] was an NIS analyst who was convicted of spying for Israel after being caught by NIS and FBI.

These directorates are responsible for outlining the goals and objectives of NCIS relating to their functional area through the Program Direction Document. The Executive Assistant Directors exercise direction and supervision of their Program Direction Document through the three field directorates. The EAD's also advise the Deputy Director of Operations on the three field directorate Executive Assistant Directors' performance in meeting the outlined goals and objectives.\n\nThe field directorates are the Atlantic Operations Directorate, Pacific Operations Directorate, and the Global Operations Directorate.\n\nThe geographic Atlantic Operations and Pacific Operations directorates are divided into field offices, each headed by a Special Agent in Charge (SAC), while the functional Global Operations Directorate is divided into field offices and field operational support elements, headed by Special Agents in Charge or Division Chiefs. The SAC / Division Chief is responsible for all operational, investigative, and administrative activities within their geographical/functional area of responsibility. They exercise leadership of geographic implementation of NCIS' goals and objectives through the direction and supervision of Assistant Special Agents in Charge (ASAC) and Supervisory Special Agents (SSA). In field offices with only one ASAC, the ASAC is the Chief Operations Officer of the field office, responsible for the day-to-day oversight and management of its activities. In field offices with multiple ASAC's, the ASAC's serve as the heads of specific functions within the field office (e.g. ASAC of Criminal Investigations or ASAC of Atlantic Operations). The field office headquarters also has specialized teams, headed by Supervisory Special Agents, ready to support the field office's subordinate units by dispatching experienced Special Agents and/or civilian investigators to assist in investigations if a prolonged investigation is required or the investigative resources required exceeds the subordinate unit's capabilities. Usually the senior-most Special Agent of the field team is designated as the Senior Field Agent who may also have some operational and/or administrative responsibilities.\n\nThe geographic field offices are divided into NCIS Resident Agencies (NCISRA) and NCIS Resident Units (NCISRU). NCISRA's are headed by Supervisory Special Agents (designated as Resident Agents in Charge) who supervise all sworn Special Agents and civilian personnel assigned to the NCISRA. Depending on the size or location of the NCISRA, the Resident Agent in Charge may also supervise other Supervisory Special Agents who serve as team leaders, responsible for a specific investigative/operational function within the NCISRA (e.g. SSA of Counter-Terrorism). Some NCISRA's are further divided into NCISRU's, which are small units consisting of only one or two Special Agents (designated as Resident Agents) who report directly to the Resident Agent in Charge of the \"parent NCISRA.\" In NCISRU's which are staffed by multiple Special Agents, the senior-most Special Agent is designated as the Senior Resident Agent and may also have some operational and/or administrative responsibilities. NCIS Special Agent Afloat duty posts are also classified as NCISRU's (e.g. NCISRU [[USS George H.W. Bush|USS ''George H.W. Bush'']]). NCISRU's afloat are under the functional supervision of the field office responsible for the vessel's homeport but receive operational support from the field office responsible for the area where the ship is sailing in.<ref name=Manual />\n\n=====National Security Directorate=====\nThe National Security Directorate has program management oversight of counter-terrorism/counterintelligence investigations and operations, including espionage, terrorism, compromise, technology transfer, cyber intrusion, insider threat, and threats to research development and acquisition programs.

These special agents are assigned to aircraft carriers and other deployed major combatants. Their environment can best be described as a \"floating city.\" The assignment offers many of the same investigative challenges found by any criminal investigator working in a metropolitan city. A special agent assigned to a carrier must be skilled in general criminal investigations including: crime scene examination, expert interview techniques, and use of proactive law enforcement procedures to stop criminal activity before it occurs. The special agent afloat also provides guidance on foreign counterintelligence matters, including terrorism. It is also the mission of the special agent afloat to offer Navy and Marine Corps leadership advice and operational support on security issues which might threaten the safety of ships, personnel and resources.\n\nThe Special Agent Afloat (SAA) program was initiated in Europe during March 1967. In April 1971, a special agent was assigned to a deployed carrier for a period of six months with the designation of SAA. By 1978, SAA personnel were assigned to each operational aircraft carrier in the U. S. Navy for a one-year assignment. In 1986, a trial began where two Special Agents Afloat were assigned to aircraft carriers in an effort to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of having two agents assigned full-time while deployed, one focusing on law enforcement/criminal investigations and one on foreign counterintelligence. The trial was discontinued when no longer considered viable.<ref name=Manual />\n\n===Protective Operations===\nThe Naval Criminal Investigative Service is the only entity within the Department of the Navy authorized to conduct protection of Department of Defense/Department of the Navy (DOD/DON) High Risk Billets (HRB). The mission of the NCIS Protective Operations Field Office (POFO) is to prevent terrorist and/or criminal attacks on principals under NCIS executive protection coverage and execute the necessary and appropriate response to a threat and/or attack on a principal. POFO will also initiate investigations on individuals and groups who meet a specific threshold when a threat is detected or needs to be validated.\n\nNCIS provides and manages full-time protection details on key Department of the Navy personnel, including:\n* [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]]\n* [[Chief of Naval Operations]]\n* [[Commandant of the Marine Corps]]\n\nTo supplement POFO's operational mission, it maintains an internal Protective Intelligence Unit (PIU) to identify potential threats that could affect a principal, understand a principal's level of vulnerability to any given threat, and use available intelligence to mitigate threats and/or risk to a principal. The Protective Intelligence Unit works extensively with the [[United States Secret Service|U.S. Secret Service]], [[Pentagon Force Protection Agency]], [[United States Army Criminal Investigation Command|U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command]], [[United States Air Force Office of Special Investigations|U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations]], and the [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshals Service]].<ref name=POFO>{{cite web | url=http://www.ncis.navy.mil:80/AboutNCIS/Locations/Washington/Pages/POFO.aspx | title=NCIS POFO | work=Naval Criminal Investigative Service | publisher=(ncis.navy.mil) | accessdate=January 13, 2019 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180210034739/http://www.ncis.navy.mil/AboutNCIS/Locations/Washington/Pages/POFO.aspx | archivedate=February 10, 2018 | url-status=live }}{{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\n===Multiple Threat Alert Center===\n{{Main|Multiple Threat Alert Center}}\nThe Multiple Threat Alert Center (MTAC) utilizes NCIS' worldwide presence and combination of [[Law enforcement organisation|law enforcement]], [[counterintelligence]], [[Intelligence assessment|intelligence]] and [[security]] capabilities to identify a wide range of threats to [[U.S. Navy|Navy]] and [[U.S. Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] personnel and assets around the world.

REACT teams are designed to support investigations and \"high-risk\" enforcement operations within the United States, including high-risk operations that involve the service of arrest and search warrants, undercover agent and source protection/rescue, undercover operations, high-risk surveillance, and high-risk protective assignments.<ref name=REACT />\n\nREACT team is organized, equipped, directed, and controlled by the Deputy Assistant Director, Criminal Investigations and Operations Department, Criminal Operations Directorate, and is under the direction of the REACT commander and deputy commander. Because of NCIS' changing needs and mobility, realignments of field offices, and geographical differences, the composition of each team may vary. In general, each REACT team will be composed of one team leader (TL), one assistant team leader (ATL), and multiple tactical operators. Assignment to REACT is strictly voluntary and REACT is classified as a collateral duty, meaning Special Agents assigned to REACT remain in their original assignments within the field office when not called into service with REACT.\n\nIf REACT assistance is determined to be necessary, the field office SAC or his/her designee will contact the REACT commander, or deputy commander if the commander is unavailable, for further discussion and evaluation. The Deputy Assistant Director of Criminal Investigations and Operations maintains final approval authority for the use of REACT and the execution of a proposed operation.<ref name=Manual3>{{cite web | url=https://www.ncis.navy.mil/Documents/Reading%20Room/NCIS%203%20release.pdf | title=NCIS Manual 3 | work=Naval Criminal Investigative Service | publisher=(ncis.navy.mil) | accessdate=June 11, 2019}}{{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\n==Directors of NCIS==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; border:1px #AAAAFF solid\"\n|-\n!| N\u00b0\n!| Portrait\n!| Name\n!| Term\n!style=\"width:400px;\" | Notes\n!| [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Appointer]]\n|-\n! 1\n|[[File:Roy D.

David Brant and Thomas Betro, two former directors of NCIS, both had minor cameo appearances in the series during their respective tenures as Director. Director Omar Lopez was featured in a cameo role in episode 20 of season 17 which aired on April 14, 2020.\n**In 2009, that series spun off ''[[NCIS: Los Angeles]]'', featuring a fictional representation of the Office of Special Projects, based in [[Los Angeles]] that specializes in undercover assignments. Former NCIS Director Mark D. Clookie had a minor cameo appearance in the third season of the series, appearing as \"NCIS Special Agent Clookie\". Andrew Traver (fifth Director of NCIS) also had a minor appearance in the seventh season of the series, appearing as \"NCIS Special Agent Gates\".\n**A second spin-off set in a small NCIS Resident Agency in New Orleans (part of the Southeast Field Office), ''[[NCIS: New Orleans]]'', started in 2014.\n* The [[Pentagon Channel]] aired a documentary in June 2009 entitled ''Recon: Military CSI'' about crime scene investigation techniques used in the theater of war by NCIS special agents.\n* The [[National Geographic Channel]] filmed a documentary entitled ''Inside the Real NCIS''.<ref>[http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/episodes/inside-the-real-ncis/ Inside the Real NCIS] - National Geographic Channel</ref>\n* [[Investigation Discovery]] filmed a 13-episode series called ''The Real NCIS'' highlighting thirteen different crimes solved by NCIS special agents.\n* In 2017, CBS began airing ''[[48 Hours (TV series)#48 Hours: NCIS|48 Hours: NCIS]]'', an extension of the ''48 Hours'' investigative program focused on real life NCIS cases, and narrated by [[Rocky Carroll]] of ''NCIS''.\n\n;Film\n* The 2000 film ''Dangerous Evidence: The Lori Jackson Story'' is based on the 1995 best-selling book ''Dangerous Evidence''. The book recounts the true story of NIS agents accused of framing an African-American [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] corporal for a crime he did not commit. CBS News journalist Ellis A. Cohen covered the story for ''[[60 Minutes]]'' and then wrote the book and produced the Lifetime movie.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n;Books\n* In [[Richard Marcinko]]'s book ''[[Rogue Warrior (book)|Rogue Warrior]]'', he details his conflict with NIS.  Later, an NIS investigation named \"Iron Eagle\" would result in a [[federal prison]] sentence.\n* ''Special Agent, Vietnam: A Naval Intelligence Memoir'' was written by former Special Agent Douglass H. Hubbard about special agents during the [[Vietnam War]]. Hubbard served as an NIS special agent in Vietnam from 1969 to 1972.\n* Author [[Mel Odom (author)|Mel Odom]] authored an NCIS series of novels entitled ''Paid in Blood'', ''Blood Evidence'', and ''Bloodlines''.\n* ''The Crisis: A Dan Lenson Novel'' by [[David Poyer]] details the adventures of NCIS special agents in the [[Horn of Africa]] (HOA).\n* ''Capturing [[Jonathan Pollard]]: How One of the Most Notorious Spies in American History Was Brought to Justice'' was published in 2006.  Written by retired NCIS Special Agent Ron Olive, it recounts the NIS investigation of Pollard.\n* ''The Smack Track'', by [[Ian McPhedran]], about how the Royal Australian Navy battles pirates, gun runners and drug smugglers in the seas of the [[Persian Gulf]] and the Horn of Africa along the infamous route known as the 'smack track'. Since about 2010, NCIS special agents are routinely assigned as law enforcement advisors afloat to serve alongside the Australian sailors looking for contraband.\n*[[Dick Tracy]] is a U.S. comic strip featuring a tough and intelligent police detective created by Chester Gould.  In a prose novel by [[Max Allan Collins]] based on the strip,{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} ''[[Dick Tracy Goes to War]]'', Tracy accepts a direct commission as a Lieutenant Commander in the U.S. Naval Reserve and to go on active duty as an Agent of the Office of Naval Intelligence, the precursor to NCIS. In the comic strip, as detailed in the 1944 sequence pitting Tracy against an [[Axis Powers|Axis]] spy Alfred \"The Brow\" Brau, Tracy is commissioned into the same position with ONI, but holds the rank of Lieutenant.\n\n== See also ==\n\n===Military criminal investigative organizations===\n* [[Defense Criminal Investigative Service]] (DCIS)\n* [[United States Air Force Office of Special Investigations]] (AFOSI or OSI)\n* [[United States Army Counterintelligence]] (ACI)\n* [[United States Army Criminal Investigation Command]] (USACIDC or CID)\n* [[United States Marine Corps Criminal Investigation Division]] (USMCCID)\n* [[Coast Guard Investigative Service]] (CGIS)\n\n===Federal law enforcement===\n* [[List of United States federal law enforcement agencies]]\n* [[Master-at-arms (United States Navy)]]\n* [[Shore Patrol]] (USN and USMC)\n* [[Criminal Investigation Task Force]] (CITF)\n* [[Military police]]\n* [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries Office for Law Enforcement]] (OLE)\n* [[Special agent]]\n* [[U.S. Coast Guard]]\n* [[Diplomatic Security Service|U.S. Diplomatic Security Service (DSS), State Department]]\n\n===JAG Corps===\n* [[Judge Advocate General's Corps, U.S. Navy]]\n* [[U.S. Marine Corps Judge Advocate Division]]\n\n===Intelligence===\n* [[Marine Corps Intelligence Activity]]\n* [[Office of Naval Intelligence]] (ONI)\n* [[United States Army Counterintelligence]] (ACI)\n* [[United States Army Intelligence and Security Command]] (INSCOM)\n* [[Coast Guard Intelligence]] (CGI)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [http://vmicraig.blogspot.com/2006/05/protecting-americas-heroes.html Protecting America's Heroes]\n*{{cite news\n | last = Schmitt\n | first = Eric\n | date = 11 June 1990\n | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/11/us/navy-investigators-face-new-attack.html\n | title = Navy Investigators Face New Attack\n | work = [[The New York Times]]\n | accessdate = 2008-01-02\n}} Gives history of criticisms of NCIS/NIS performance in high-profile cases.\n* [http://www.shootingwire.com/story/129135 Shootingwire.com]\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n* {{Official website|http://www.ncis.navy.mil/ }}\n* [https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2013/november/nics-15th-anniversary-stats-show-success-of-gun-background-check-system NICS Turns 15 -

Its primary function is to investigate criminal activities involving the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] and [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]], though its broad mandate includes [[national security]], [[counterintelligence]], [[counter-terrorism]], [[cyber warfare]], and the protection of U.S. naval assets worldwide. NCIS is the successor organization to the former '''Naval Investigative Service''' ('''NIS'''), which was established by the [[Office of Naval Intelligence]] after the [[Second World War]].\n\nThe vast majority of NCIS personnel are [[civilian]], with half being [[special agent]]s. NCIS agents are armed [[federal police|federal law enforcement]] investigators, who frequently coordinate with other U.S. government agencies and have a presence in more than 41 countries and on U.S. Navy vessels. NCIS special agents are supported by analysts and other experts skilled in disciplines such as [[forensics]], [[surveillance]], surveillance countermeasures, computer investigations, physical security, and [[polygraph]] examinations.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nNCIS traces its roots to Navy Department General Order 292 of 1882, signed by [[William H. Hunt]], [[Secretary of the Navy]], which established the [[Office of Naval Intelligence]] (ONI). Initially, ONI was tasked with collecting information on the characteristics and weaponry of foreign vessels, charting foreign passages, rivers, or other bodies of water, and touring overseas fortifications, industrial plants, and shipyards.\n\nIn anticipation of the [[United States]]' entry into [[World War I]], ONI's responsibilities expanded to include [[espionage]], [[sabotage]], and all manner of information on the U.S. Navy's potential adversaries. In [[World War II]] ONI became responsible for the investigation of sabotage, espionage and [[subversive activities]] that posed any kind of threat to the Navy.\n\n===NIS and the Cold War===\nThe major buildup of civilian special agents began with the [[Korean War]] in 1950, and continued through the [[Cold War]] years. In 1966 the name Naval Investigative Service (NIS) was adopted to distinguish the organization from the rest of ONI, and in 1969 NIS special agents were reclassified from contract employees and became [[Excepted service|Excepted Civil Service]].\n\nIn the early 1970s, an NIS special agent was stationed on {{USS|Intrepid|CV-11|6}} for six months. This marked the beginning of the \"Deployment Afloat\" program, now called the Special Agent Afloat program, which deploys special agents for year-long assignments aboard carrier battle groups and amphibious readiness groups. In 1972, background investigations were transferred from NIS to the newly formed [[Defense Security Service|Defense Investigative Service]] (DIS), allowing NIS to give more attention to criminal investigations and [[counter-intelligence]]. The 1970s also saw NIS' first female agent, who was stationed at [[Marine Corps Air Station Miramar|Naval Air Station Miramar]], [[California]] in 1975.\n\nIn 1982, NIS assumed responsibility for managing the U.S. Navy's Law Enforcement and Physical Security Program and the U.S. Navy's Information and Personnel Security Program. Additionally, in 1982, two classes of NIS Special Agents were trained at the [[Federal Law Enforcement Training Center]] (FLETC) in [[Glynco, Georgia]], in an assessment of the school's capability to train military investigators. Prior to this and subsequently until 1984, NIS Special Agent Training was in ONI Headquarters in [[Suitland, Maryland]]. In 1984, NIS Special Agents began training at FLETC, along with other federal investigative agencies, except for the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]], and the [[United States Postal Inspection Service]].\n\nTwo months after the October 1983 [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|bombing of the Marine Barracks in Beirut]], the agency opened the [[Navy Antiterrorist Alert Center]] (ATAC), a [[24/7|24-hour-a-day]] operational intelligence center that issued indications and warnings on [[terrorist activity]] to Navy and Marine Corps commands. ATAC was the facility at which [[Jonathan Pollard]] was working when he committed the [[Jonathan Pollard#Espionage|acts of espionage]] for which he was convicted in 1987. In 2002 the ATAC became the [[Multiple Threat Alert Center]] (MTAC).\n\nIn 1985, Cathal L. Flynn became the first [[Admiral (United States)|admiral]] to lead NIS. The command took on the additional responsibility of Information and Personnel Security. In 1986, the [[Department of the Navy Central Adjudication Facility]] (DoN CAF) was established and placed under the agency, as the agency was now once again responsible for [[Adjudication|adjudicating]] [[security clearance]]s (although not the actual investigations). DoN CAF renders approximately 200,000 eligibility determinations annually for the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]].\n\nIn 1991, NIS was responsible for investigating the [[Tailhook scandal]], which involved allegations of sexual misconduct and harassment by Naval and Marine Corps officers in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]].  Subsequent to this investigation, and at the direction of the chairman of the [[US Senate Armed Services Committee]], Senator [[Sam Nunn]], the Naval Investigative Service was restructured into the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS).  The restructuring occurred as a result of perceived lapses in proper investigative technique over the Tailhook scandal, as well as chain of command issues and a lack of civilian oversight in previous investigations.

NCIS oversees the [[Master-at-arms (United States Navy)|Master-at-Arms]] programs for the Navy, overseeing 8800 Masters-at-Arms and the [[Military Working Dog]] program. NCIS's three strategic priorities are to prevent terrorism, protect secrets, and reduce crime.\n\nCurrent missions for NCIS include criminal investigations, [[force protection]], cross-[[border]] [[Illegal drug trade|drug enforcement]], anti-terrorism, counter-terrorism, major procurement fraud, [[computer crime]] and [[counter-intelligence]].\n\nNCIS Special Agent [[Peter Garza]] conducted the first court-ordered [[Internet]] [[wiretap]] in the United States.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=19603&seqNum=3\n |title=Joy Riders: Mischief That Leads to Mayhem |accessdate=2009-11-01 |first=Richard |last=Power\n |authorlink= |date=October 30, 2000 |work=[[InformIT (publisher)|InformIT]] |publisher=[[Pearson Education]]\n |quote=\"I called the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in Boston on a Thursday and asked if we could have the court order in place by Monday,\" Garza recounts. \"They laughed.

The EAD's also advise the Deputy Director of Operations on the three field directorate Executive Assistant Directors' performance in meeting the outlined goals and objectives.\n\nThe field directorates are the Atlantic Operations Directorate, Pacific Operations Directorate, and the Global Operations Directorate.\n\nThe geographic Atlantic Operations and Pacific Operations directorates are divided into field offices, each headed by a Special Agent in Charge (SAC), while the functional Global Operations Directorate is divided into field offices and field operational support elements, headed by Special Agents in Charge or Division Chiefs. The SAC / Division Chief is responsible for all operational, investigative, and administrative activities within their geographical/functional area of responsibility. They exercise leadership of geographic implementation of NCIS' goals and objectives through the direction and supervision of Assistant Special Agents in Charge (ASAC) and Supervisory Special Agents (SSA). In field offices with only one ASAC, the ASAC is the Chief Operations Officer of the field office, responsible for the day-to-day oversight and management of its activities. In field offices with multiple ASAC's, the ASAC's serve as the heads of specific functions within the field office (e.g. ASAC of Criminal Investigations or ASAC of Atlantic Operations). The field office headquarters also has specialized teams, headed by Supervisory Special Agents, ready to support the field office's subordinate units by dispatching experienced Special Agents and/or civilian investigators to assist in investigations if a prolonged investigation is required or the investigative resources required exceeds the subordinate unit's capabilities. Usually the senior-most Special Agent of the field team is designated as the Senior Field Agent who may also have some operational and/or administrative responsibilities.\n\nThe geographic field offices are divided into NCIS Resident Agencies (NCISRA) and NCIS Resident Units (NCISRU). NCISRA's are headed by Supervisory Special Agents (designated as Resident Agents in Charge) who supervise all sworn Special Agents and civilian personnel assigned to the NCISRA. Depending on the size or location of the NCISRA, the Resident Agent in Charge may also supervise other Supervisory Special Agents who serve as team leaders, responsible for a specific investigative/operational function within the NCISRA (e.g. SSA of Counter-Terrorism). Some NCISRA's are further divided into NCISRU's, which are small units consisting of only one or two Special Agents (designated as Resident Agents) who report directly to the Resident Agent in Charge of the \"parent NCISRA.\" In NCISRU's which are staffed by multiple Special Agents, the senior-most Special Agent is designated as the Senior Resident Agent and may also have some operational and/or administrative responsibilities. NCIS Special Agent Afloat duty posts are also classified as NCISRU's (e.g. NCISRU [[USS George H.W. Bush|USS ''George H.W. Bush'']]).

These special agents are assigned to aircraft carriers and other deployed major combatants. Their environment can best be described as a \"floating city.\" The assignment offers many of the same investigative challenges found by any criminal investigator working in a metropolitan city. A special agent assigned to a carrier must be skilled in general criminal investigations including: crime scene examination, expert interview techniques, and use of proactive law enforcement procedures to stop criminal activity before it occurs. The special agent afloat also provides guidance on foreign counterintelligence matters, including terrorism. It is also the mission of the special agent afloat to offer Navy and Marine Corps leadership advice and operational support on security issues which might threaten the safety of ships, personnel and resources.\n\nThe Special Agent Afloat (SAA) program was initiated in Europe during March 1967. In April 1971, a special agent was assigned to a deployed carrier for a period of six months with the designation of SAA. By 1978, SAA personnel were assigned to each operational aircraft carrier in the U. S. Navy for a one-year assignment. In 1986, a trial began where two Special Agents Afloat were assigned to aircraft carriers in an effort to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of having two agents assigned full-time while deployed, one focusing on law enforcement/criminal investigations and one on foreign counterintelligence. The trial was discontinued when no longer considered viable.<ref name=Manual />\n\n===Protective Operations===\nThe Naval Criminal Investigative Service is the only entity within the Department of the Navy authorized to conduct protection of Department of Defense/Department of the Navy (DOD/DON) High Risk Billets (HRB). The mission of the NCIS Protective Operations Field Office (POFO) is to prevent terrorist and/or criminal attacks on principals under NCIS executive protection coverage and execute the necessary and appropriate response to a threat and/or attack on a principal. POFO will also initiate investigations on individuals and groups who meet a specific threshold when a threat is detected or needs to be validated.\n\nNCIS provides and manages full-time protection details on key Department of the Navy personnel, including:\n* [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]]\n* [[Chief of Naval Operations]]\n* [[Commandant of the Marine Corps]]\n\nTo supplement POFO's operational mission, it maintains an internal Protective Intelligence Unit (PIU) to identify potential threats that could affect a principal, understand a principal's level of vulnerability to any given threat, and use available intelligence to mitigate threats and/or risk to a principal. The Protective Intelligence Unit works extensively with the [[United States Secret Service|U.S. Secret Service]], [[Pentagon Force Protection Agency]], [[United States Army Criminal Investigation Command|U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command]], [[United States Air Force Office of Special Investigations|U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations]], and the [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshals Service]].<ref name=POFO>{{cite web | url=http://www.ncis.navy.mil:80/AboutNCIS/Locations/Washington/Pages/POFO.aspx | title=NCIS POFO | work=Naval Criminal Investigative Service | publisher=(ncis.navy.mil) | accessdate=January 13, 2019 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180210034739/http://www.ncis.navy.mil/AboutNCIS/Locations/Washington/Pages/POFO.aspx | archivedate=February 10, 2018 | url-status=live }}{{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\n===Multiple Threat Alert Center===\n{{Main|Multiple Threat Alert Center}}\nThe Multiple Threat Alert Center (MTAC) utilizes NCIS' worldwide presence and combination of [[Law enforcement organisation|law enforcement]], [[counterintelligence]], [[Intelligence assessment|intelligence]] and [[security]] capabilities to identify a wide range of threats to [[U.S. Navy|Navy]] and [[U.S. Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] personnel and assets around the world.

REACT teams are designed to support investigations and \"high-risk\" enforcement operations within the United States, including high-risk operations that involve the service of arrest and search warrants, undercover agent and source protection/rescue, undercover operations, high-risk surveillance, and high-risk protective assignments.<ref name=REACT />\n\nREACT team is organized, equipped, directed, and controlled by the Deputy Assistant Director, Criminal Investigations and Operations Department, Criminal Operations Directorate, and is under the direction of the REACT commander and deputy commander. Because of NCIS' changing needs and mobility, realignments of field offices, and geographical differences, the composition of each team may vary. In general, each REACT team will be composed of one team leader (TL), one assistant team leader (ATL), and multiple tactical operators. Assignment to REACT is strictly voluntary and REACT is classified as a collateral duty, meaning Special Agents assigned to REACT remain in their original assignments within the field office when not called into service with REACT.\n\nIf REACT assistance is determined to be necessary, the field office SAC or his/her designee will contact the REACT commander, or deputy commander if the commander is unavailable, for further discussion and evaluation. The Deputy Assistant Director of Criminal Investigations and Operations maintains final approval authority for the use of REACT and the execution of a proposed operation.<ref name=Manual3>{{cite web | url=https://www.ncis.navy.mil/Documents/Reading%20Room/NCIS%203%20release.pdf | title=NCIS Manual 3 | work=Naval Criminal Investigative Service | publisher=(ncis.navy.mil) | accessdate=June 11, 2019}}{{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\n==Directors of NCIS==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; border:1px #AAAAFF solid\"\n|-\n!| N\u00b0\n!| Portrait\n!| Name\n!| Term\n!style=\"width:400px;\" | Notes\n!| [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Appointer]]\n|-\n! 1\n|[[File:Roy D.

David Brant and Thomas Betro, two former directors of NCIS, both had minor cameo appearances in the series during their respective tenures as Director. Director Omar Lopez was featured in a cameo role in episode 20 of season 17 which aired on April 14, 2020.\n**In 2009, that series spun off ''[[NCIS: Los Angeles]]'', featuring a fictional representation of the Office of Special Projects, based in [[Los Angeles]] that specializes in undercover assignments. Former NCIS Director Mark D. Clookie had a minor cameo appearance in the third season of the series, appearing as \"NCIS Special Agent Clookie\". Andrew Traver (fifth Director of NCIS) also had a minor appearance in the seventh season of the series, appearing as \"NCIS Special Agent Gates\".\n**A second spin-off set in a small NCIS Resident Agency in New Orleans (part of the Southeast Field Office), ''[[NCIS: New Orleans]]'', started in 2014.\n* The [[Pentagon Channel]] aired a documentary in June 2009 entitled ''Recon: Military CSI'' about crime scene investigation techniques used in the theater of war by NCIS special agents.\n* The [[National Geographic Channel]] filmed a documentary entitled ''Inside the Real NCIS''.<ref>[http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/episodes/inside-the-real-ncis/ Inside the Real NCIS] - National Geographic Channel</ref>\n* [[Investigation Discovery]] filmed a 13-episode series called ''The Real NCIS'' highlighting thirteen different crimes solved by NCIS special agents.\n* In 2017, CBS began airing ''[[48 Hours (TV series)#48 Hours: NCIS|48 Hours: NCIS]]'', an extension of the ''48 Hours'' investigative program focused on real life NCIS cases, and narrated by [[Rocky Carroll]] of ''NCIS''.\n\n;Film\n* The 2000 film ''Dangerous Evidence: The Lori Jackson Story'' is based on the 1995 best-selling book ''Dangerous Evidence''. The book recounts the true story of NIS agents accused of framing an African-American [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] corporal for a crime he did not commit. CBS News journalist Ellis A. Cohen covered the story for ''[[60 Minutes]]'' and then wrote the book and produced the Lifetime movie.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n;Books\n* In [[Richard Marcinko]]'s book ''[[Rogue Warrior (book)|Rogue Warrior]]'', he details his conflict with NIS.

Ryakhovsky was {{convert|6|ft|6|in|cm|abbr=on}} tall and weighed {{convert|280|lb|kg}}. In 1982, Ryakhovsky claimed he began to feel \"an irresistible desire for intimacy with a woman\", and made several attempts to [[rape]] elderly women in the [[Golyanovo District|Golyanovo]] area of east Moscow, for which he was convicted of [[hooliganism]] and received a four-year sentence in prison.\n\n==Murders==\nIn 1988, Ryakhovsky committed his first murder when he killed a [[homosexual]] man in Bitsa, a village in Moscow Oblast on the outskirts of Moscow. The same year he killed three homosexual men in Izmailovski Park, which Ryakhovsky claimed was part of his personal mission to \"cleanse\" society by killing homosexuals and [[prostitutes]]. Despite this, the majority of his victims between 1988 and 1993 were elderly women, although he also killed five men and two teenagers. Ryakhovsky's main methods of killing were [[stabbing]] or [[strangulation]] with his bare hands or a rope, and after the victim had died he [[mutilated]] the bodies, mainly in the [[genital]] area. Some corpses of Ryakhovsky's victims would have [[Necrophilia|sexual acts]] performed upon them. In January 1993, Ryakhovsky murdered a 78-year-old man, cut off his head with a [[hunting knife]] and, one day later, returned to cut off his leg. His next victim, a 65-year-old woman, had her [[abdomen]] ruptured with a weak [[pyrotechnics|pyrotechnical device]].<ref>[http://asylumeclectica.com/asylum/morbid/archives/morb1199.htm Morbid Fact Du Jour Archive<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927232130/http://asylumeclectica.com/asylum/morbid/archives/morb1199.htm |date=27 September 2011 }}</ref> He [[hanging|hanged]], eviscerated, and then decapitated his penultimate victim, a 16-year-old boy, with a knife.\n\n==Arrest and conviction==\nDuring a routine search of a [[crime scene]] area, police investigators found a shack with a [[noose]] fixed to the ceiling. Considering it a part of the preparation for the next murder, they decided to set an ambush. On 13 April 1993 Ryakhovsky arrived at the shack and was subsequently arrested by the police officers. Despite his considerable strength and violent temperament, Ryakhovsky showed absolutely no resistance, later admitting that after seeing weapons in the hands of officers he became frozen with fear.<ref>''Kriminalnaya Rossiya: Sovremyennye Khroniki'' TV documentary</ref> \nThe Russian press nicknamed Ryakhovsky \"The Balashikha Ripper\" and \"The [[Hippopotamus]]\" because of his thick neck and hulking posture.<ref>[http://www.mayhem.net/Crime/serial2.html The Serial Killer Hit List - Part II<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> During the investigation Ryakhovsky co-operated with officials and investigators, willingly indicating crime scenes and describing methods of killing. According to his confessions, most murders were not planned and were rather an effect of a sudden impulse, which was used to explain motivation behind the murder of a 70-year-old woman and 78-year-old man Ryakhovsky had accidentally met in the forest. There was an exception, as the murders of the three homosexuals he had met in Izmailovski Park in 1988 were thoroughly planned. Most victims were people over 40 and around 50 years of age, while three of his victims were over 60.\n\nAccording to psychiatrists from the [[Moscow Serbsky Institute]], Ryakhovsky's [[necrophiliac]] tendencies were caused by a malfunction in his [[central nervous system]]. He was evaluated as [[sanity|sane]], competent for trial and fully responsible for his actions. However, after being informed of his diagnosis, Ryakhovsky's behaviour changed dramatically. At first, complacent and fully co-operating with the investigators, he suddenly became obstructive, stopped co-operating, began demanding punishment for the experts, and also revoked his previous confessions. During the [[1993 Russian constitutional crisis]], Ryakhovsky, who supported the [[Supreme Soviet]], wrote a letter to [[Alexander Rutskoy]] claiming that he is an innocent victim of the \"anti-national authority\".\n\nIn July 1995, Ryakhovsky was sentenced to [[death penalty|death]] by [[firing squad]], and after hearing the verdict said: \"I will be back\". However, in 1996 Russia imposed a [[Capital punishment in Russia#Moratorium|moratorium]] on executions, instead the sentence was [[clemency|commuted]] to [[life imprisonment]] in a [[Prison#Security levels|maximum-security]] penal colony in [[Solikamsk]], [[Perm Oblast]].<ref>[http://english.mn.ru/english/issue.php?2007-15-30 The Moscow News<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218151723/http://english.mn.ru/english/issue.php?2007-15-30 |date=18 December 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nRyakhovsky died on 21 January 2005 from long untreated [[tuberculosis]] while serving his sentence in prison.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ryakhovsky, Sergei}}\n[[Category:1962 births]]\n[[Category:2005 deaths]]\n[[Category:21st-century deaths from tuberculosis]]\n[[Category:Male serial killers]]\n[[Category:Necrophiles]]\n[[Category:People convicted of murder by Russia]]\n[[Category:Prisoners sentenced to death by Russia]]\n[[Category:Prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment by Russia]]\n[[Category:Prisoners who died in Russian detention]]\n[[Category:Russian murderers of children]]\n[[Category:Russian people convicted of murder]]\n[[Category:Russian prisoners sentenced to death]]\n[[Category:Russian rapists]]\n[[Category:Russian serial killers]]\n[[Category:Serial killers who died in prison custody]]\n[[Category:Soviet serial killers]]\n[[Category:Violence against gay men]]\n[[Category:Violence against women in Russia]]\n[[Category:Inmates of White Swan Prison]]\n[[Category:Violence against men in Europe]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2020}}\n{{Infobox serial killer\n| name        = Sergei Ryakhovsky\n| native_name = \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0301\u0439 \u0420\u044f\u0445\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439\n| native_name_lang = ru\n| image       = SergeiRyakhovsky.png\n| image_size  = 240px\n| caption     = \n| alt         = \n| birthname   = Sergei Vasilyevich Ryakhovsky\n| alias = The Balashikha Ripper <br/> The Hippopotamus\n| birth_date      = {{birth date|df=yes|1962|12|29}}\n| birth_place    = [[Balashikha]], [[Moscow Oblast]], [[Soviet Union]]\n| death_date      = {{death date and age|df=yes|2005|1|21|1962|12|29}}\n| death_place  = [[Solikamsk]], [[Perm Oblast]], [[Russia]]\n| cause       = [[Tuberculosis]]\n| conviction  = [[Murder]]\n| sentence    = [[Capital punishment|Death]] (commuted to [[life imprisonment]])\n| victims     = 19+\n| beginyear   = 1988\n| endyear     = 1993\n| country     = [[Soviet Union]], [[Russia]]\n| apprehended = 13 April 1993\n}}\n\n'''Sergei Vasilyevich Ryakhovsky''' ({{lang-ru|\u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0301\u0439 \u0412\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0420\u044f\u0445\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439}}; 29 December 1962 \u2013 21 January 2005) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-[[Russia]]n [[serial killer]], convicted for the killing of 19 people in the [[Moscow]] area between 1988 and 1993.\n\n==Background==\nSergei Vasilyevich Ryakhovsky was born on 29 December 1962, in the Saltykovka area of [[Balashikha]], [[Moscow Oblast]], a city 1 kilometre (0.62&nbsp;mi) east of [[Moscow]].
