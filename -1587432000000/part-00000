In the first phase of this period, almost every city between [[Troy]] and [[Gaza City|Gaza]] was violently destroyed, and often left unoccupied thereafter (for example, [[Hattusas]], [[Mycenae]], [[Ugarit]]). The gradual end of the Dark Age that ensued saw the rise of settled [[Neo-Hittite]] [[Aramaean]] kingdoms of the mid-10th century BC, and the rise of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]].\n\nWhile the cultural advances during the Bronze Age had mostly been confined to the eastern parts of the Mediterranean, with the Iron Age, the entire coastal region surrounding the Mediterranean now becomes involved, significantly due to the [[Phoenicians|Phoenician]] expansion from the Levant, beginning in ca. the 12th century. [[Fernand Braudel]] remarked in ''The Perspective of the World'' that Phoenicia was an early example of a \"world-economy\" surrounded by empires. The high point of Phoenician culture and sea power is usually placed ca. 1200\u2013800&nbsp;BC. Many of the most important Phoenician settlements had been established long before this: [[Byblos]], [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], [[Sidon]], [[Simyra]], [[Arwad]], and [[Beirut|Berytus]], all appear in the [[Amarna tablets]].\n\nThe Phoenicians and the Assyrians transported elements of the Late Bronze Age culture of the Near East to Iron Age [[Archaic Greece|Greece]] and [[Iron Age Italy|Italy]], but also further afield to [[Ancient Libya|Northwestern Africa]] and to [[Tartessos|Iberia]], initiating the beginning of Mediterranean history now known as [[Classical Antiquity]].\nThey notably spread [[History of the alphabet|alphabetic writing]], which would become the hallmark of the Mediterranean civilizations of the Iron Age, in contrast to the [[Assyrian cuneiform|cuneiform]] writing of Assyria and the [[Chinese bronze inscriptions|logographic]] system in the Far East (and later the [[abugida]] systems of India).\n\n== Classical antiquity ==\n[[File:Greek Colonization Archaic Period.svg|thumb|250px|[[Magna Graecia|Greek colonies]] during the 8th and 7th centuries BC.]]\nTwo of the most notable Mediterranean civilizations in [[classical antiquity]] were the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[city state]]s and the [[Phoenicia]]ns. The Greeks expanded throughout the [[Black Sea]] and south through the [[Red Sea]]. The Phoenicians spread through the western Mediterranean reaching [[North Africa]] and the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. From the 6th century BC up to including the 5th century BC, many of the significant Mediterranean peoples were under Persian rule, making them dominate the Mediterranean during these years. Both the Phoenicians and some of the [[Greek city states]] in Asia Minor provided the naval forces of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]]. Persian dominance ended after the [[Greco-Persian War]] in the 5th century BC and Persia was crippled by Macedonia in the 4th century BC.

The ''hetairoi'' ([[Companion cavalry]]) was considered the strongest of their time.<ref>Diodorus Siculus, Arrian</ref> Under [[Alexander the Great]], this force turned east, and in a series of decisive battles, it routed the Persian forces and took over as the dominant empire of the Mediterranean. Their Macedonia empire included present-day Greece, Bulgaria, Egypt, the Phoenician lands and many other basin regions of the Mediterranean and Asia Minor.\n\nThe major centres of the Mediterranean at the time became part of Alexander's empire as a result. His empire quickly disintegrated, and the Middle East, Egypt, and Greece were soon again independent. Alexander's conquests spread Greek knowledge and ideas throughout the region.\n\n=== Roman\u2013Carthaginian rivalry ===\n{{See also|Punic Wars|Roman Republic|Ancient Carthage|Carthage}}\n\nThese eastern powers soon began to be overshadowed by those farther west. In North Africa, the former Phoenician colony of [[Carthage]] rose to dominate its surroundings with an empire that contained many of the former Phoenician holdings. However, it was a city on the [[Italian Peninsula]], [[Rome]], that would eventually dominate the entire Mediterranean basin. Spreading first through Italy, Rome defeated Carthage in the [[Punic Wars]], despite [[Hannibal]]'s famous efforts against Rome in the [[Second Punic War]].\n\nAfter the [[Third Punic War]], Rome then became the leading force in the Mediterranean region. The Romans soon spread east, taking Greece, and the Greek heritage played an important role in the Roman Empire. By this point the coastal trading cultures were thoroughly dominant over the inland river valleys that had once been the heart of the great powers. Egyptian power moved from the Nile cities to the coastal ones, especially [[Alexandria]]. Mesopotamia became a fringe border region between the Roman Empire and the Persians.\n\n=== Roman ''Mare Nostrum'' ===\n[[File:The Roman Empire ca 400 AD.png|thumb|250px|The ''Mare nostrum'', surrounded by [[Roman Empire|Roman]] territory in c. 400 AD.]]\n{{further|Mare Nostrum|Roman Empire}}\n\nWhen [[Augustus]] founded the [[Roman Empire]], the Mediterranean sea began to be called ''[[Mare Nostrum]]'' ([[Latin language|Latin]]: \"Our Sea\") by the Romans. Their empire was centered on this sea and all the area was full of commerce and naval development. For the first time in history, an entire sea (the Mediterranean) was free of piracy. For several centuries, the Mediterranean was a \"Roman Lake\", surrounded on all sides by the empire.\n\nThe empire began to crumble, however, in the fifth century and [[Rome]] collapsed after 476 CE.\n\n=== Sasanian and Byzantine times ===\n{{Main|Sasanian Empire}} and {{Main|Byzantine Empire}}\nThe Eastern Roman or [[Byzantine empire]] began its domination of the Levant during its [[Byzantine-Sassanid Wars|wars with neighbouring Sassanid Persia]]. The rule through the 6th century CE saw climatic instability, causing inconsistent production, distribution, and a general economic decline.<ref>Daniel Fuks, Avner Ayalon, et al., \"Dust clouds, climate change and coins: consiliences of palaeoclimate and economy in the Late Antique southern Levant\", ''Journal of the Council for British Research in the Levant'' 49/2 (Oct. 2017): 205-223.\nDownload citation https://doi.org/10.1080/00758914.2017.1379181</ref> The Sasanians gained territory on Mediterranean land regularly, but the Eastern Romans remained superior in the Mediterranean sea for centuries. In the first quarter of the 7th century CE, the Sasanians took swaths of the Mediterranean region from the Eastern Romans during the [[Byzantine\u2013Sasanian War of 602\u2013628]], though the Sasanians lost territories by the end of the war. Ultimately, Byzantine domination in the region was forever finished by invasions of the Arabs and later the Turks.<ref>Crawford, Peter (2013).

In a series of rapid [[Muslim conquests]], the [[Rashidun army|Arab armies]], motivated by Islam and led by the [[Caliph]]s and skilled military commanders such as [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]], swept through most of the Middle East; [[Byzantine-Arab Wars|reducing Byzantine lands]] by more than half and completely [[Islamic conquest of Persia|engulfing the Persian lands]].\n\nThe Arab invasions disrupted the trade relations between Western and Eastern Europe while cutting the trade route with Oriental lands. This however had the indirect effect of promoting the trade across the [[Caspian Sea]]. The export of grains from [[Egypt]] was re-routed towards the [[Eastern world]]. Oriental goods like silk and spices were carried from Egypt to ports like [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] and [[Constantinople]] by sailors and Jewish merchants. The [[Viking expansion|Viking raids]] further disrupted the trade in western Europe and brought it to a halt. However, the [[Norsemen]] developed the trade from Norway to the [[White Sea]], while also trading in luxury goods from [[Al-Andalus|Spain]] and the Mediterranean. The [[Byzantine Empire under the Isaurian dynasty|Byzantines in the mid-8th century]] retook control of the area around the north-eastern part of the Mediterranean. Venetian ships from the 9th century armed themselves to counter the harassment by Arabs while concentrating trade of oriental goods at Venice.<ref>{{cite book|last=Couper|first=Alastair|title=The Geography of Sea Transport|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WFVACwAAQBAJ&pg=PA37&dq=The+Geography+of+Sea+Transport&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjxmJiKorfdAhXHXrwKHWxpBvQQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&q&f=false|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=978-1-317-35150-4|page=33\u201337|access-date=2018-09-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180913112908/https://books.google.com/books?id=WFVACwAAQBAJ&pg=PA37&dq=The+Geography+of+Sea+Transport&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjxmJiKorfdAhXHXrwKHWxpBvQQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&q&f=false|archive-date=2018-09-13|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe powerful and long-lived [[Bulgarian Empire]] was the main European rival in the region of the Mediterranean [[Balkans|Balkan peninsula]] between the 7th and the 14th centuries, creating an important [[Golden Age of medieval Bulgarian culture|cultural]], [[Third Rome|political]], [[Cyrillic script|linguistic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Slavs|religious]] legacy during the [[Middle Ages]]. \n\nIn [[Anatolia]], the Muslim [[Siege of Constantinople (718)|expansion was blocked]] by the still capable Byzantines with the help of the [[Tervel of Bulgaria|Tervel]] of [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]]. The Byzantine provinces of [[Muslim conquest of Syria|Roman Syria]], [[Umayyad conquest of North Africa|North Africa]], and Sicily, however, could not mount such a resistance, and the Muslim conquerors swept through those regions. At the far west, they crossed the sea taking [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Visigothic Hispania]] before being [[Battle of Tours|halted in southern France]] by the [[Franks]]. At its greatest extent, the [[Caliphate|Arab Empire]] controlled 3/4 of the Mediterranean region, the only other empire besides the Roman Empire to control most of the Mediterranean Sea.<ref>Subhi Y.

The threat of becoming a slave was a constant fear for peasants, fishermen and merchants. Those with money or who had financial backing only feared the lack of support, should they be threatened with abduction for ransom.\n\nThere were several things which could happen to people in the Mediterranean region of the Middle Ages:\n# When [[wikt:corsair|Corsairs]], [[piracy|pirate]], [[Barbary corsairs]], [[French corsairs]] or [[commerce raiders]] plied their trade, a peasant, fisherman or coastal villager, who had no financial backing, could be abducted or sold to slave traders, or adversaries, who made large profits on an international market;\n# If the captive was wealthy or had influential supporters, the captive could be ransomed. This would be the most advantageous plan, since the money exchange was immediate and direct, not long and drawn out as in the slave market business;\n# The captive could be used immediately by the corsair for labour on the ship rather than traded. In battles during this era, prisoners of war were often captured and used as slaves.\n\nEmperors would take large numbers of prisoners, parade them through the capital, hold feasts in honour of their capture and parade diplomats in front of them as a display of victory.<ref name=\"Europe and the Islamic World: A History \">{{cite book|author1=Tolan, John |author2=Veinstein, Gilles |author3=Henry Laurens |title=\"Europe and the Islamic World: A History\".|date=2013|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|isbn=978-0-691-14705-5|pages=67\u201368}}</ref>\n\n=== Late Middle Ages ===\n{{further|Maritime republics|Crown of Aragon|Crown of Castile|Ottoman Empire}}\n\n[[File:Republik Venedig Handelswege01.png|thumb|250px|[[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] (red) and [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] (green) maritime trade routes in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]].]]\nThe \"Repubbliche Marinare\" (Maritime republics) of [[Republic of Amalfi|Amalfi]], [[Duchy of Gaeta|Gaeta]], [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]], [[Republic of Ancona|Ancona]], [[Republic of Pisa|Pisa]] and [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusa]] developed their own \"empires\" in the Mediterranean shores. The Islamic states had never been major naval powers, and trade from the east to Europe was soon in the hands of Italian traders, especially the Genoese and the Venetians, who profited immensely from it. The [[Republic of Pisa]] and later the [[Republic of Ragusa]] used diplomacy to further trade and maintained a libertarian approach in civil matters to further sentiment in its inhabitants.\n\nThe [[republic of Venice]] got to dominate the eastern mediterranean shores after the [[Fourth Crusade]].{{Sfn|Banaji|2007|p=62-63}}\n\nBetween 1275 and 1344 a struggle for the control of the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] took place. Featuring the [[Marinid Sultanate]], the [[Nasrid Kingdom of Granada]], the [[Crown of Castile]], the [[Crown of Arag\u00f3n]], the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] and the [[Republic of Genoa]], it was characterized by changing alliances between the main actors.{{Sfn|L\u00f3pez|1996\u20131997|p=405}} The iberian cities of [[Tarifa]], [[Ceuta]], [[Algeciras]] or [[Ronda]] and the African port of [[Ceuta]] were at stake.{{Sfn|L\u00f3pez|1996\u20131997|p=405}}\nThe Western Mediterranean sea was dominated by the [[Crown of Aragon]]: thanks to their possessions of [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]], the [[Kingdom of Naples]], the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], the [[Balearic Islands]], the [[Duchy of Athens]] the [[Duchy of Neopatria]], and several northern African cities.\n\nIn 1347 the [[Black Death]] spread from [[Constantinople]] across the mediterranean basin.{{Sfn|Sola|2006|p=46}}\n\nOttoman power continued to grow, and in 1453, the Byzantine Empire was extinguished with the [[fall of Constantinople]]. The Ottomans already controlled Greece, [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] and much of the [[Balkans]] and soon also began to spread through North Africa. North Africa had grown wealthy from the trade across the [[Sahara Desert]], but the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], who, along with other Christian powers, had been engaged in a long campaign to evict the Muslims from Iberia, had found a method to circumvent this trade by trading directly with [[West Africa]].  This was enabled by a new type of ships, the [[caravel]], that made trade in the rough Atlantic waters profitable for the first time.  The reduction in the Saharan trade weakened North Africa, and made them an easy target for the Ottomans.\n\nCeuta was ultimately taken by the Kingdom of Portugal in 1415, searching to undermine Castilian, Aragonese, and Genoese interests in the area.{{Sfn|Banaji|2007|pp=49; 63\u201364}}\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, rival Christian and Muslim kingdoms forbade the trade of particular goods to enemy kingdoms including weaponry and other contraband items. The popes forbade the export of these commodities to the Islamic world. The Ottomans too forbade the export of weapons and other strategic items, declaring them ''memnu e\u015fya'' or ''memnu olan'' to Christian states even in peace treaties, however friendly states could import some of the prohibited goods through [[Capitulations of the Ottoman Empire|capitulations]]. Despite these prohibitions, trade of contraband occurred on both sides. The European merchants traded in illegal goods with Muslims. The Ottomans were unable to suppress the trade with smuggling being undertaken mainly in the winter when the [[Ottoman Navy]] stationed at the [[Imperial Arsenal|Istanbul Arsenal]] was unable to stop Ottoman and non-Ottoman vessels from indulging in the trade.<ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire|authors=Ga \u0301bor A \u0301goston, Bruce Alan Masters|page=145|publisher=Infobase Publishing}}</ref>\n\n== Modern era ==\n{{further|Ottoman Empire|Portuguese Empire|Spanish Empire|Italian Empire}}\n\n[[File:OttomanEmpireIn1683.png|thumb|250px|[[Ottoman Empire]] territories acquired between 1300 and 1683.]]\n[[File:ItalianMareNostrum.jpg|thumb|250px|Greatest extent of Italian control of the Mediterranean littoral and seas (within green line & dots) in summer/fall 1942. Allied-controlled areas in red.]]\nThe growing naval prowess of the European powers confronted further rapid Ottoman expansion in the region when the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Battle of Lepanto]] checked the power of the Ottoman navy. However, as [[Braudel]] argued forcefully, this only slowed the Ottoman expansion instead of ending it. The prized island of [[Cyprus]] became Ottoman in 1571. The last resistance in [[Tunisia]] ended in 1574 and almost a generation long siege in [[Crete]] pushed Venetians out of this strategic island in 1669.\n\nA [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] was then established between [[Spain]] and [[Ottoman Empire]] until the 18th century, each dominating their respective half of Mediterranean, reducing Italian navies as naval powers increasingly more irrelevant. Furthermore, the Ottoman Empire had succeeded in their objective of extending Muslim rule across the North African coast.\n\nThe development of long range seafaring had an influence upon the entire Mediterranean. While once all trade from the east had passed through the region, the [[Portuguese discoveries|circumnavigation of Africa]] allowed [[gold]], [[spice]]s, and [[dye]]s to be imported directly to the Atlantic ports of western Europe.  The Americas were also a source of extreme wealth to the western powers, from which some of the Mediterranean states were largely cut off.\n\nThe base of European power thus shifted northward and the once wealthy [[Italy]] became a peripheral area dominated by foreigners.  The Ottoman Empire also began a slow decline that saw its North African possessions gain de facto independence and its European holdings gradually reduced by the increasing power of Austria and Russia.\n\nBy the nineteenth century the European States were vastly more powerful, and began to colonize North Africa.  France spread its power south by taking [[Algeria]] in 1830 and later [[Tunisia]]. Britain gained control of [[Egypt]] in 1882. [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] conquered [[Libya]] from the Ottomans in 1911. Greece [[Greek War of Independence|achieved independence in 1832]]. The Ottoman Empire finally collapsed in the [[World War I|First World War]], and its holdings were carved up among France and Britain. The [[rump state]] of the wider Ottoman Empire became the independent state of [[Turkey]] in 1923. Yugoslavia was created from the former Austro-Hungarian empire at the end of the First World War.\n\nDuring the first half of the twentieth century the Mediterranean was at the center of the expansion of the [[Kingdom of Italy]], and was one of the main areas of battle during [[World War II]] between the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]] and the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. Post-world war period was marked by increasing activity in the Eastern Mediterranean, where naval actions formed part of ongoing Arab\u2013Israeli conflict and Turkey had [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|occupied the northern part of Cyprus]]. Cold War tensions split the Mediterranean into pro-American and pro-Soviet factions, with Turkey, Greece, Spain, Italy and France being [[NATO]] members. Syria was socialist and a pro-Soviet regime, offering the Soviets [[Tartus|a port for their navy]] from an agreement in 1971. Yugoslavia was Communist but in neither the Soviet nor American camps. Egypt tilted towards the Soviets during the time of [[Nasser]] but then turned towards American influence during the time of [[Sadat]]. Israel and Egypt both received massive American military aid. American naval power made the Mediterranean a base for the [[United States Sixth Fleet]] during the Cold war.\n\nToday, the Mediterranean Sea is the southern border of the [[European Union]] and represents one of the largest area by Trade in the World. The Maltese prime minister described the Mediterranean sea as a \"cemetery\" due to the large amounts of migrants who drown there.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2013/10/migrant-deaths-prompt-calls-eu-action-2013101361646517233.html|title=Migrant deaths prompt calls for EU action|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=13 October 2013|accessdate=27 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180801061324/https://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2013/10/migrant-deaths-prompt-calls-eu-action-2013101361646517233.html|archive-date=1 August 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Following the [[2013 Lampedusa migrant shipwreck]], the Italian government, has decided to strengthen the national system for the patrolling of the Mediterranean Sea by authorizing [[Operation Mare Nostrum]], a military and humanitarian operation in order to rescue the migrants and arrest the traffickers of immigrants.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurasia-rivista.org/loperazione-mare-nostrum/20335/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718050114/http://www.eurasia-rivista.org/loperazione-mare-nostrum/20335/ |archivedate=2014-07-18 }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Eastern Mediterranean]]\n* [[History of Anatolia]]\n* [[History of North Africa]]\n* [[History of the Levant]]\n* [[History of Western civilization]]\n* [[Life zones of the Mediterranean region]]\n* [[Mediterranean Basin]]\n* [[Union for the Mediterranean]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* {{Cite journal|journal=[[Historical Materialism (journal)|Historical Materialism]]|volume=15|year=2007|pages=47\u201374|title=Islam, the Mediterranean and the Rise of Capitalism|first=Jairus|last=Banaji|url=http://eprints.soas.ac.uk/15983/1/Islam%20and%20capitalism.pdf|location=Leiden|publisher=[[Brill Publishers|Koninklijke Brill]]|issn=1465-4466}}\n* {{Cite journal|title=De nuevo sobre la \"guerra del Estrecho\" la contribuci\u00f3n financiera del reino de Valencia en la \u00faltima fase del conflicto (1332\u20131344)|first=Mar\u00eda Dolores|last=L\u00f3pez|journal=Anales de la Universidad de Alicante.

In the first phase of this period, almost every city between [[Troy]] and [[Gaza City|Gaza]] was violently destroyed, and often left unoccupied thereafter (for example, [[Hattusas]], [[Mycenae]], [[Ugarit]]). The gradual end of the Dark Age that ensued saw the rise of settled [[Neo-Hittite]] [[Aramaean]] kingdoms of the mid-10th century BC, and the rise of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]].\n\nWhile the cultural advances during the Bronze Age had mostly been confined to the eastern parts of the Mediterranean, with the Iron Age, the entire coastal region surrounding the Mediterranean now becomes involved, significantly due to the [[Phoenicians|Phoenician]] expansion from the Levant, beginning in ca. the 12th century. [[Fernand Braudel]] remarked in ''The Perspective of the World'' that Phoenicia was an early example of a \"world-economy\" surrounded by empires. The high point of Phoenician culture and sea power is usually placed ca. 1200\u2013800&nbsp;BC. Many of the most important Phoenician settlements had been established long before this: [[Byblos]], [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], [[Sidon]], [[Simyra]], [[Arwad]], and [[Beirut|Berytus]], all appear in the [[Amarna tablets]].\n\nThe Phoenicians and the Assyrians transported elements of the Late Bronze Age culture of the Near East to Iron Age [[Archaic Greece|Greece]] and [[Iron Age Italy|Italy]], but also further afield to [[Ancient Libya|Northwestern Africa]] and to [[Tartessos|Iberia]], initiating the beginning of Mediterranean history now known as [[Classical Antiquity]].\nThey notably spread [[History of the alphabet|alphabetic writing]], which would become the hallmark of the Mediterranean civilizations of the Iron Age, in contrast to the [[Assyrian cuneiform|cuneiform]] writing of Assyria and the [[Chinese bronze inscriptions|logographic]] system in the Far East (and later the [[abugida]] systems of India).\n\n== Classical antiquity ==\n[[File:Greek Colonization Archaic Period.svg|thumb|250px|[[Magna Graecia|Greek colonies]] during the 8th and 7th centuries BC.]]\nTwo of the most notable Mediterranean civilizations in [[classical antiquity]] were the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[city state]]s and the [[Phoenicia]]ns. The Greeks expanded throughout the [[Black Sea]] and south through the [[Red Sea]]. The Phoenicians spread through the western Mediterranean reaching [[North Africa]] and the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. From the 6th century BC up to including the 5th century BC, many of the significant Mediterranean peoples were under Persian rule, making them dominate the Mediterranean during these years. Both the Phoenicians and some of the [[Greek city states]] in Asia Minor provided the naval forces of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]]. Persian dominance ended after the [[Greco-Persian War]] in the 5th century BC and Persia was crippled by Macedonia in the 4th century BC.

The ''hetairoi'' ([[Companion cavalry]]) was considered the strongest of their time.<ref>Diodorus Siculus, Arrian</ref> Under [[Alexander the Great]], this force turned east, and in a series of decisive battles, it routed the Persian forces and took over as the dominant empire of the Mediterranean. Their Macedonia empire included present-day Greece, Bulgaria, Egypt, the Phoenician lands and many other basin regions of the Mediterranean and Asia Minor.\n\nThe major centres of the Mediterranean at the time became part of Alexander's empire as a result. His empire quickly disintegrated, and the Middle East, Egypt, and Greece were soon again independent. Alexander's conquests spread Greek knowledge and ideas throughout the region.\n\n=== Roman\u2013Carthaginian rivalry ===\n{{See also|Punic Wars|Roman Republic|Ancient Carthage|Carthage}}\n\nThese eastern powers soon began to be overshadowed by those farther west. In North Africa, the former Phoenician colony of [[Carthage]] rose to dominate its surroundings with an empire that contained many of the former Phoenician holdings. However, it was a city on the [[Italian Peninsula]], [[Rome]], that would eventually dominate the entire Mediterranean basin. Spreading first through Italy, Rome defeated Carthage in the [[Punic Wars]], despite [[Hannibal]]'s famous efforts against Rome in the [[Second Punic War]].\n\nAfter the [[Third Punic War]], Rome then became the leading force in the Mediterranean region. The Romans soon spread east, taking Greece, and the Greek heritage played an important role in the Roman Empire. By this point the coastal trading cultures were thoroughly dominant over the inland river valleys that had once been the heart of the great powers. Egyptian power moved from the Nile cities to the coastal ones, especially [[Alexandria]]. Mesopotamia became a fringe border region between the Roman Empire and the Persians.\n\n=== Roman ''Mare Nostrum'' ===\n[[File:The Roman Empire ca 400 AD.png|thumb|250px|The ''Mare nostrum'', surrounded by [[Roman Empire|Roman]] territory in c. 400 AD.]]\n{{further|Mare Nostrum|Roman Empire}}\n\nWhen [[Augustus]] founded the [[Roman Empire]], the Mediterranean sea began to be called ''[[Mare Nostrum]]'' ([[Latin language|Latin]]: \"Our Sea\") by the Romans. Their empire was centered on this sea and all the area was full of commerce and naval development. For the first time in history, an entire sea (the Mediterranean) was free of piracy. For several centuries, the Mediterranean was a \"Roman Lake\", surrounded on all sides by the empire.\n\nThe empire began to crumble, however, in the fifth century and [[Rome]] collapsed after 476 CE.\n\n=== Sasanian and Byzantine times ===\n{{Main|Sasanian Empire}} and {{Main|Byzantine Empire}}\nThe Eastern Roman or [[Byzantine empire]] began its domination of the Levant during its [[Byzantine-Sassanid Wars|wars with neighbouring Sassanid Persia]]. The rule through the 6th century CE saw climatic instability, causing inconsistent production, distribution, and a general economic decline.<ref>Daniel Fuks, Avner Ayalon, et al., \"Dust clouds, climate change and coins: consiliences of palaeoclimate and economy in the Late Antique southern Levant\", ''Journal of the Council for British Research in the Levant'' 49/2 (Oct. 2017): 205-223.\nDownload citation https://doi.org/10.1080/00758914.2017.1379181</ref> The Sasanians gained territory on Mediterranean land regularly, but the Eastern Romans remained superior in the Mediterranean sea for centuries. In the first quarter of the 7th century CE, the Sasanians took swaths of the Mediterranean region from the Eastern Romans during the [[Byzantine\u2013Sasanian War of 602\u2013628]], though the Sasanians lost territories by the end of the war. Ultimately, Byzantine domination in the region was forever finished by invasions of the Arabs and later the Turks.<ref>Crawford, Peter (2013).

In a series of rapid [[Muslim conquests]], the [[Rashidun army|Arab armies]], motivated by Islam and led by the [[Caliph]]s and skilled military commanders such as [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]], swept through most of the Middle East; [[Byzantine-Arab Wars|reducing Byzantine lands]] by more than half and completely [[Islamic conquest of Persia|engulfing the Persian lands]].\n\nThe Arab invasions disrupted the trade relations between Western and Eastern Europe while cutting the trade route with Oriental lands. This however had the indirect effect of promoting the trade across the [[Caspian Sea]]. The export of grains from [[Egypt]] was re-routed towards the [[Eastern world]]. Oriental goods like silk and spices were carried from Egypt to ports like [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] and [[Constantinople]] by sailors and Jewish merchants. The [[Viking expansion|Viking raids]] further disrupted the trade in western Europe and brought it to a halt. However, the [[Norsemen]] developed the trade from Norway to the [[White Sea]], while also trading in luxury goods from [[Al-Andalus|Spain]] and the Mediterranean. The [[Byzantine Empire under the Isaurian dynasty|Byzantines in the mid-8th century]] retook control of the area around the north-eastern part of the Mediterranean. Venetian ships from the 9th century armed themselves to counter the harassment by Arabs while concentrating trade of oriental goods at Venice.<ref>{{cite book|last=Couper|first=Alastair|title=The Geography of Sea Transport|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WFVACwAAQBAJ&pg=PA37&dq=The+Geography+of+Sea+Transport&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjxmJiKorfdAhXHXrwKHWxpBvQQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&q&f=false|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=978-1-317-35150-4|page=33\u201337|access-date=2018-09-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180913112908/https://books.google.com/books?id=WFVACwAAQBAJ&pg=PA37&dq=The+Geography+of+Sea+Transport&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjxmJiKorfdAhXHXrwKHWxpBvQQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&q&f=false|archive-date=2018-09-13|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe powerful and long-lived [[Bulgarian Empire]] was the main European rival in the region of the Mediterranean [[Balkans|Balkan peninsula]] between the 7th and the 14th centuries, creating an important [[Golden Age of medieval Bulgarian culture|cultural]], [[Third Rome|political]], [[Cyrillic script|linguistic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Slavs|religious]] legacy during the [[Middle Ages]]. \n\nIn [[Anatolia]], the Muslim [[Siege of Constantinople (718)|expansion was blocked]] by the still capable Byzantines with the help of the [[Tervel of Bulgaria|Tervel]] of [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]]. The Byzantine provinces of [[Muslim conquest of Syria|Roman Syria]], [[Umayyad conquest of North Africa|North Africa]], and Sicily, however, could not mount such a resistance, and the Muslim conquerors swept through those regions. At the far west, they crossed the sea taking [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Visigothic Hispania]] before being [[Battle of Tours|halted in southern France]] by the [[Franks]]. At its greatest extent, the [[Caliphate|Arab Empire]] controlled 3/4 of the Mediterranean region, the only other empire besides the Roman Empire to control most of the Mediterranean Sea.<ref>Subhi Y.

After its conquest by the Christian [[Normans]], the island developed its own distinct culture with the fusion of Latin and Byzantine influences.

The threat of becoming a slave was a constant fear for peasants, fishermen and merchants. Those with money or who had financial backing only feared the lack of support, should they be threatened with abduction for ransom.\n\nThere were several things which could happen to people in the Mediterranean region of the Middle Ages:\n# When [[wikt:corsair|Corsairs]], [[piracy|pirate]], [[Barbary corsairs]], [[French corsairs]] or [[commerce raiders]] plied their trade, a peasant, fisherman or coastal villager, who had no financial backing, could be abducted or sold to slave traders, or adversaries, who made large profits on an international market;\n# If the captive was wealthy or had influential supporters, the captive could be ransomed. This would be the most advantageous plan, since the money exchange was immediate and direct, not long and drawn out as in the slave market business;\n# The captive could be used immediately by the corsair for labour on the ship rather than traded. In battles during this era, prisoners of war were often captured and used as slaves.\n\nEmperors would take large numbers of prisoners, parade them through the capital, hold feasts in honour of their capture and parade diplomats in front of them as a display of victory.<ref name=\"Europe and the Islamic World: A History \">{{cite book|author1=Tolan, John |author2=Veinstein, Gilles |author3=Henry Laurens |title=\"Europe and the Islamic World: A History\".|date=2013|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|isbn=978-0-691-14705-5|pages=67\u201368}}</ref>\n\n=== Late Middle Ages ===\n{{further|Maritime republics|Crown of Aragon|Crown of Castile|Ottoman Empire}}\n\n[[File:Republik Venedig Handelswege01.png|thumb|250px|[[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] (red) and [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] (green) maritime trade routes in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]].]]\nThe \"Repubbliche Marinare\" (Maritime republics) of [[Republic of Amalfi|Amalfi]], [[Duchy of Gaeta|Gaeta]], [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]], [[Republic of Ancona|Ancona]], [[Republic of Pisa|Pisa]] and [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusa]] developed their own \"empires\" in the Mediterranean shores. The Islamic states had never been major naval powers, and trade from the east to Europe was soon in the hands of Italian traders, especially the Genoese and the Venetians, who profited immensely from it. The [[Republic of Pisa]] and later the [[Republic of Ragusa]] used diplomacy to further trade and maintained a libertarian approach in civil matters to further sentiment in its inhabitants.\n\nThe [[republic of Venice]] got to dominate the eastern mediterranean shores after the [[Fourth Crusade]].{{Sfn|Banaji|2007|p=62-63}}\n\nBetween 1275 and 1344 a struggle for the control of the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] took place. Featuring the [[Marinid Sultanate]], the [[Nasrid Kingdom of Granada]], the [[Crown of Castile]], the [[Crown of Arag\u00f3n]], the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] and the [[Republic of Genoa]], it was characterized by changing alliances between the main actors.{{Sfn|L\u00f3pez|1996\u20131997|p=405}} The iberian cities of [[Tarifa]], [[Ceuta]], [[Algeciras]] or [[Ronda]] and the African port of [[Ceuta]] were at stake.{{Sfn|L\u00f3pez|1996\u20131997|p=405}}\nThe Western Mediterranean sea was dominated by the [[Crown of Aragon]]: thanks to their possessions of [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]], the [[Kingdom of Naples]], the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], the [[Balearic Islands]], the [[Duchy of Athens]] the [[Duchy of Neopatria]], and several northern African cities.\n\nIn 1347 the [[Black Death]] spread from [[Constantinople]] across the mediterranean basin.{{Sfn|Sola|2006|p=46}}\n\nOttoman power continued to grow, and in 1453, the Byzantine Empire was extinguished with the [[fall of Constantinople]]. The Ottomans already controlled Greece, [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] and much of the [[Balkans]] and soon also began to spread through North Africa. North Africa had grown wealthy from the trade across the [[Sahara Desert]], but the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], who, along with other Christian powers, had been engaged in a long campaign to evict the Muslims from Iberia, had found a method to circumvent this trade by trading directly with [[West Africa]].  This was enabled by a new type of ships, the [[caravel]], that made trade in the rough Atlantic waters profitable for the first time.  The reduction in the Saharan trade weakened North Africa, and made them an easy target for the Ottomans.\n\nCeuta was ultimately taken by the Kingdom of Portugal in 1415, searching to undermine Castilian, Aragonese, and Genoese interests in the area.{{Sfn|Banaji|2007|pp=49; 63\u201364}}\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, rival Christian and Muslim kingdoms forbade the trade of particular goods to enemy kingdoms including weaponry and other contraband items. The popes forbade the export of these commodities to the Islamic world. The Ottomans too forbade the export of weapons and other strategic items, declaring them ''memnu e\u015fya'' or ''memnu olan'' to Christian states even in peace treaties, however friendly states could import some of the prohibited goods through [[Capitulations of the Ottoman Empire|capitulations]]. Despite these prohibitions, trade of contraband occurred on both sides. The European merchants traded in illegal goods with Muslims. The Ottomans were unable to suppress the trade with smuggling being undertaken mainly in the winter when the [[Ottoman Navy]] stationed at the [[Imperial Arsenal|Istanbul Arsenal]] was unable to stop Ottoman and non-Ottoman vessels from indulging in the trade.<ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire|authors=Ga \u0301bor A \u0301goston, Bruce Alan Masters|page=145|publisher=Infobase Publishing}}</ref>\n\n== Modern era ==\n{{further|Ottoman Empire|Portuguese Empire|Spanish Empire|Italian Empire}}\n\n[[File:OttomanEmpireIn1683.png|thumb|250px|[[Ottoman Empire]] territories acquired between 1300 and 1683.]]\n[[File:ItalianMareNostrum.jpg|thumb|250px|Greatest extent of Italian control of the Mediterranean littoral and seas (within green line & dots) in summer/fall 1942. Allied-controlled areas in red.]]\nThe growing naval prowess of the European powers confronted further rapid Ottoman expansion in the region when the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Battle of Lepanto]] checked the power of the Ottoman navy. However, as [[Braudel]] argued forcefully, this only slowed the Ottoman expansion instead of ending it. The prized island of [[Cyprus]] became Ottoman in 1571. The last resistance in [[Tunisia]] ended in 1574 and almost a generation long siege in [[Crete]] pushed Venetians out of this strategic island in 1669.\n\nA [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] was then established between [[Spain]] and [[Ottoman Empire]] until the 18th century, each dominating their respective half of Mediterranean, reducing Italian navies as naval powers increasingly more irrelevant. Furthermore, the Ottoman Empire had succeeded in their objective of extending Muslim rule across the North African coast.\n\nThe development of long range seafaring had an influence upon the entire Mediterranean. While once all trade from the east had passed through the region, the [[Portuguese discoveries|circumnavigation of Africa]] allowed [[gold]], [[spice]]s, and [[dye]]s to be imported directly to the Atlantic ports of western Europe.  The Americas were also a source of extreme wealth to the western powers, from which some of the Mediterranean states were largely cut off.\n\nThe base of European power thus shifted northward and the once wealthy [[Italy]] became a peripheral area dominated by foreigners.  The Ottoman Empire also began a slow decline that saw its North African possessions gain de facto independence and its European holdings gradually reduced by the increasing power of Austria and Russia.\n\nBy the nineteenth century the European States were vastly more powerful, and began to colonize North Africa.  France spread its power south by taking [[Algeria]] in 1830 and later [[Tunisia]]. Britain gained control of [[Egypt]] in 1882. [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] conquered [[Libya]] from the Ottomans in 1911. Greece [[Greek War of Independence|achieved independence in 1832]]. The Ottoman Empire finally collapsed in the [[World War I|First World War]], and its holdings were carved up among France and Britain. The [[rump state]] of the wider Ottoman Empire became the independent state of [[Turkey]] in 1923. Yugoslavia was created from the former Austro-Hungarian empire at the end of the First World War.\n\nDuring the first half of the twentieth century the Mediterranean was at the center of the expansion of the [[Kingdom of Italy]], and was one of the main areas of battle during [[World War II]] between the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]] and the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. Post-world war period was marked by increasing activity in the Eastern Mediterranean, where naval actions formed part of ongoing Arab\u2013Israeli conflict and Turkey had [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|occupied the northern part of Cyprus]]. Cold War tensions split the Mediterranean into pro-American and pro-Soviet factions, with Turkey, Greece, Spain, Italy and France being [[NATO]] members. Syria was socialist and a pro-Soviet regime, offering the Soviets [[Tartus|a port for their navy]] from an agreement in 1971. Yugoslavia was Communist but in neither the Soviet nor American camps. Egypt tilted towards the Soviets during the time of [[Nasser]] but then turned towards American influence during the time of [[Sadat]]. Israel and Egypt both received massive American military aid.

Organised and hosted by [[the Kennel Club]], it is the largest show of its kind in the world.\n\nCrufts is centred on a championship [[conformation show]] for [[dog]]s, and includes a large [[trade show]] of mainly dog-related goods and services, as well as competitions in [[dog agility]], [[obedience training|obedience]], [[flyball]] and [[heelwork to music]]. It is held over four days (Thursday to Sunday) in early March at the [[National Exhibition Centre]] (NEC) in [[Birmingham]], England. \n\nCrufts consists of several competitions occurring at the same time. The main competition is for the [[List of Best in Show winners of Crufts|Best in Show]] award, which is hotly contested by dogs and their owners throughout the world.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Crufts 1891.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Crufts exhibition 1891]]\n\nCrufts was named after its founder, [[Charles Cruft (showman)|Charles Cruft]], who worked as general manager for a [[dog biscuit]] manufacturer, travelling to dog shows both in the United Kingdom and internationally, which allowed him to establish contacts and understand the need for higher standards for dog shows.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} In 1886, Cruft's first dog show, billed as the \"First Great Terrier Show\", had 57 classes and 600 entries.<ref name=\"Telegraph10Things\">{{cite news|last1=Hogan|first1=Michael|title=10 things you didn't know about Crufts|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-crufts/|accessdate=28 September 2017|work=The Telegraph|date=1 March 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"VetMedicInfographic\" /> The first show named \"Crufts\"\u2014\"Cruft's Greatest Dog Show\"\u2014was held at the [[Royal Agricultural Hall]], [[Islington]], in 1891.

The show continued annually and gained popularity each year until Charles' death in 1938. His widow ran the show for four years until she felt unable to do so due to its high demands of time and effort. To ensure the future and reputation of the show (and, of course, her husband's work), she sold it to [[The Kennel Club]] in 1942.<ref name=\"StandHistoryCrufts\" /><ref name=\"VetMedicInfographic\" />\n\nIn 1936, \"The [[Golden Jubilee|Jubilee]] Show\" had 10,650 entries with the number of breeds totalling 80.<ref name=\"VetMedicInfographic\" />{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} The show was again interrupted by the [[Second World War]],<ref name=\"StandHistoryCrufts\" /><ref name=\"Telegraph10Things\" /> therefore the 1948 show was the first to be held under the new owner and was held at [[Olympia, London|Olympia]] in London,<ref name=\"VetMedicInfographic\" /> where it continued to gain popularity with each passing year.

In 1978, [[Dog agility|agility]] was introduced as a demonstration, to later become a competition in 1980, with an international invitational competition added in 2001. In 1985, the Young Kennel Club was founded to promote dog handling among younger people. [[Flyball]] was introduced in 1990, and in 1992, the first [[Heelwork to Music]] demonstration was carried out by [[Mary Ray]]. A shift in the emphasis of the Kennel Club led to the establishment of the Discover Dogs display encouraging responsible dog ownership in 1994, and [[Rescue dog|Rescue Dog]] Agility in 2000.<ref name=\"VetMedicInfographic\" />\n\nBy 1979, the show had to be moved to [[Earls Court]] exhibition centre as the increasing number of entries and spectators had outgrown the capacity of its previous venue.<ref name=\"StandHistoryCrufts\" /><ref name=\"VetMedicInfographic\" /> Soon, the show had to be changed again \u2013 the duration had to be increased to three days in 1982, then again in 1987 to four days as the popularity continued to increase.<ref name=\"VetMedicInfographic\" /> Since 1991, the show has been held in the [[National Exhibition Centre]], Birmingham, the first time the show had moved out of London since its inception.<ref name=\"StandHistoryCrufts\" />\n\nIt was also at the Centenary celebrations in 1991 that Crufts was officially recognised by the Guinness Book of Records as the world's largest dog show with 22,973 dogs being exhibited in conformation classes that year. Including agility and other events, it is estimated that an average 28,000 dogs take part in Crufts each year, with an estimated 160,000 human visitors attending the show.<ref name=\"Telegraph10Things\" />\n\nCrufts was formerly televised by the BBC; this ended after the 2008 event (see [[#Criticism|\"Criticism\"]]) and the 2009 event was only shown via the Internet. Since 2010 the show has been broadcast on the commercial channels [[Channel 4]] and [[More4]], attracting over 4.5 million viewers.<ref name=\"Telegraph10Things\" /><ref name=\"JuliusK9HistoryCrufts\" />\n\n==Competing for Best in Show==\nCrufts is not an open competition; dogs must have qualified throughout the previous year. There are a number of ways of qualifying for the breed classes at Crufts, but most dogs typically qualify by obtaining first, second or third place in the relevant class at a Kennel Club affiliated Championship show where Challenge Certificates are awarded, or by achieving Best in Show, Reserve Best in Show or Best Puppy in Show at a Kennel Club affiliated Open or General show. Dogs can become qualified for life upon attaining their Kennel Club Stud Book Number.<ref name=\"CruftsQualifications\">{{cite web|title=Crufts: Qualifications|url=http://crufts.org.uk/content/dog-exhibitors/qualification-for-crufts-2018/|website=crufts.org.uk|accessdate=28 September 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"GreatDogsQual\">{{cite web|title=How Can My Dog Compete?|url=http://www.greatdogs.co.uk/howcanmydogcompete.html|website=www.greatdogs.co.uk|accessdate=28 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nDogs compete in hierarchical fashion. Dogs begin by competing against others of the same [[dog breed|breed]], split by gender, age and previous class wins. These classes include ''Veteran'', ''Special Puppy'', ''Special Junior'', ''Yearling'', ''Post Graduate'', ''Mid Limit'', ''Limit'', and ''Open''. Each is awarded once for dogs and once for bitches. The dog and bitch class winners then compete again for the Dog and Bitch Challenge Certificate (CC). The two CC winners then go head-to-head to determine the Best of Breed.<ref name=\"VetMedicInfographic\" />\n\nAfter the best of each breed has been chosen, they then compete against the others in their [[Breed Groups (dog)|Group]] (in the UK, there are seven Groups: Toys, Gundogs, Utility, Hounds, Working, Pastoral, and Terriers) to find the ''[[General Specials|Best in Group]]''. The seven Group winners then compete to find the ''Best in Show'' and ''Reserve Best in Show''.<ref name=\"VetMedicInfographic\" />\n\nBest in Show winners receive a replica of the solid silver Keddall Memorial Trophy, and a small cash prize of \u00a3100.<ref name=\"Telegraph10Things\" />\n\nThe [[English Cocker Spaniel]] is the most successful breed at Crufts, having been awarded Best In Show seven times,<ref name=\"Telegraph10Things\" /><ref name=\"JuliusK9HistoryCrufts\">{{cite web|title=A Brief History of Crufts|url=https://julius-k9.co.uk/blog/a-brief-history-of-crufts/|website=julius-k9.co.uk|accessdate=28 September 2017|language=en}}</ref> and the Gundog Group is the most successful group, having produced 23 Best In Show winners.<ref name=\"JuliusK9HistoryCrufts\" />\n\n== Best in Show winners (since 2006) ==\n{{Main|List of Best in Show winners of Crufts}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Any mistake made by the dog is penalised by adding time to their result. Dogs must qualify during the preceding year to compete in individual or team events, although representative handlers and dogs from England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland are invited to compete in the International competitions.\n\nThere is an [[obedience training|obedience]] competition, now held in its own 'Obedience Arena'. Dogs qualify by being successful at shows during the preceding year to compete in the Dog and Bitch UK Obedience Championships, UK Inter-Regional Team Competition and the crowd's favourite, the Obedience World Cup. The prizes are awarded to the most obedient dog according to the judges after they have undergone various demanding activities, such as off lead heelwork at different paces, distance control, retrieve, send away, stays and scent discrimination.\n\nThe [[Flyball]] competition is a [[relay race|relay]]-style race. Teams of four dogs compete against each other in a knock-out competition. Each dog jumps a series of four hurdles, and then steps on a box, which is rigged to release a ball. The dog must then return the ball to the start of the course to tag one of its team, who then repeats this process until all the dogs have finished. Teams must qualify during the preceding year.\n\nCrufts also hold both [[musical canine freestyle|freestyle]] and [[heelwork to music]] competitions, consisting of a choreographed routine, comprising elements of obedience, set to music.\n\nThe [[gamekeeper]]s classes at Crufts focus on judging the suitability of field-bred dogs for use in the field. Dogs entered are of the [[gundog]] group, but the conformation of these dogs differs significantly from that of gundogs from show-bred bloodlines, owing to the need for function as a working gundog, and they are judged accordingly.<ref name=\"BASC\">{{cite web|title=BASC - BASC at CRUFTS|url=https://basc.org.uk/gundogs/basc-at-crufts/|website=basc.org.uk|accessdate=28 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Young Kennel Club]] (YKC) also has its own ring and stand where handlers aged between 6 and 25 compete in Agility, Obedience, Showing, Handling, Heelwork to Music, Flyball, and Grooming. Handlers and dogs must qualify in their discipline during the preceding year.\n\nCrufts hosts the World Champion Junior Handling competition in which National Best Junior Handler winners from around the globe compete for this esteemed title. Since there is a quarantine to the import of foreign dogs, many competitors must \"borrow\" dogs from gracious British show enthusiasts. The first World title competition, held in 1984, was judged by Ger Pederson. The winner of this premiere competition was US representative Tracie Laliberte who had won Westminster Kennel Club in 1983. A unique feature of this first competition was the requirement of switching dogs mid-way through the competition.\n\n== Other attractions ==\nCrufts drew 160,000 visitors to the NEC in 2008,<ref>{{cite web|title=Crufts 2008|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/birmingham/content/articles/2008/01/24/crufts_2008_feature.shtml|website=BBC Birmingham|accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref> with over 166,000 in 2019.<ref>{{cite web|title=Trade exhibitors|url=https://www.crufts.org.uk/trade-exhibitors|website=www.crufts.org.uk|accessdate=7 March 2020|language=en}}</ref> While the main purpose of the event is the search for the best dog in the show, many trade stands sell a wide range of dog-related merchandise or advertise dog-related charities.<ref name=\"GreatDogsSpecial\">{{cite web|title=What Made Crufts Become So Well Renowed(sic)?|url=http://www.greatdogs.co.uk/WhyIsCruftsSoSpecial.html|website=www.greatdogs.co.uk|accessdate=28 September 2017}}</ref> There is also a section known as [[Discover Dogs]] where visitors can see almost every breed recognised by the Kennel Club on view, and discuss each breed with knowledgeable owners.<ref name=\"CruftsDiscoverDogs\">{{cite web|title=Crufts: Discover +200 Breeds of Dog at Crufts {{!}} Find the Right One For You!|url=http://crufts.org.uk/content/whats-on/discover-dogs-at-crufts/|website=crufts.org.uk|accessdate=28 September 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\nCrufts also holds special shows and demonstrations, where specially trained dogs may perform in front of an audience.<ref name=\"RAFDogDisplay\">{{cite web|title=RAF|url=https://www.raf.mod.uk/news/archive/its-the-lead--up-to-crufts-for-the-raf-police-dogs-06032015|website=www.raf.mod.uk|accessdate=28 September 2017|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170929044430/https://www.raf.mod.uk/news/archive/its-the-lead--up-to-crufts-for-the-raf-police-dogs-06032015|archive-date=29 September 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"BBCEastMidlandsPolice\">{{cite news|last1=Jones|first1=Trystan|title=Police dogs 'boost officers' morale'|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-birmingham-17312265|accessdate=28 September 2017|work=BBC News|date=10 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Crossbreeds==\nAs the Kennel Club also registers [[crossbreed]]s, Crufts also hosts many competitions and displays for crossbreeds.

Organised and hosted by [[the Kennel Club]], it is the largest show of its kind in the world.\n\nCrufts is centred on a championship [[conformation show]] for [[dog]]s, and includes a large [[trade show]] of mainly dog-related goods and services, as well as competitions in [[dog agility]], [[obedience training|obedience]], [[flyball]] and [[heelwork to music]]. It is held over four days (Thursday to Sunday) in early March at the [[National Exhibition Centre]] (NEC) in [[Birmingham]], England. \n\nCrufts consists of several competitions occurring at the same time. The main competition is for the [[List of Best in Show winners of Crufts|Best in Show]] award, which is hotly contested by dogs and their owners throughout the world.\n\nThe Kennel Club was criticised on the [[BBC]] programme ''[[Pedigree Dogs Exposed]]'' for allowing breed standards, judging standards and breeding practices which are said to compromise the health of purebred dogs. The programme led various sponsors to withdraw. The BBC dropped Crufts 2009 from their coverage after being unable to agree to terms with The Kennel Club, with [[Channel 4]] broadcasting the event since 2010.<ref name=\"JuliusK9HistoryCrufts\" />\n\n==History==\n[[File:Crufts 1891.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Crufts exhibition 1891]]\n\nCrufts was named after its founder, [[Charles Cruft (showman)|Charles Cruft]], who worked as general manager for a [[dog biscuit]] manufacturer, travelling to dog shows both in the United Kingdom and internationally, which allowed him to establish contacts and understand the need for higher standards for dog shows.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} In 1886, Cruft's first dog show, billed as the \"First Great Terrier Show\", had 57 classes and 600 entries.<ref name=\"Telegraph10Things\">{{cite news|last1=Hogan|first1=Michael|title=10 things you didn't know about Crufts|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-crufts/|accessdate=28 September 2017|work=The Telegraph|date=1 March 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"VetMedicInfographic\" /> The first show named \"Crufts\"\u2014\"Cruft's Greatest Dog Show\"\u2014was held at the [[Royal Agricultural Hall]], [[Islington]], in 1891.

The show continued annually and gained popularity each year until Charles' death in 1938. His widow ran the show for four years until she felt unable to do so due to its high demands of time and effort. To ensure the future and reputation of the show (and, of course, her husband's work), she sold it to [[The Kennel Club]] in 1942.<ref name=\"StandHistoryCrufts\" /><ref name=\"VetMedicInfographic\" />\n\nIn 1936, \"The [[Golden Jubilee|Jubilee]] Show\" had 10,650 entries with the number of breeds totalling 80.<ref name=\"VetMedicInfographic\" />{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} The show was again interrupted by the [[Second World War]],<ref name=\"StandHistoryCrufts\" /><ref name=\"Telegraph10Things\" /> therefore the 1948 show was the first to be held under the new owner and was held at [[Olympia, London|Olympia]] in London,<ref name=\"VetMedicInfographic\" /> where it continued to gain popularity with each passing year.

In 1978, [[Dog agility|agility]] was introduced as a demonstration, to later become a competition in 1980, with an international invitational competition added in 2001. In 1985, the Young Kennel Club was founded to promote dog handling among younger people. [[Flyball]] was introduced in 1990, and in 1992, the first [[Heelwork to Music]] demonstration was carried out by [[Mary Ray]]. A shift in the emphasis of the Kennel Club led to the establishment of the Discover Dogs display encouraging responsible dog ownership in 1994, and [[Rescue dog|Rescue Dog]] Agility in 2000.<ref name=\"VetMedicInfographic\" />\n\nBy 1979, the show had to be moved to [[Earls Court]] exhibition centre as the increasing number of entries and spectators had outgrown the capacity of its previous venue.<ref name=\"StandHistoryCrufts\" /><ref name=\"VetMedicInfographic\" /> Soon, the show had to be changed again \u2013 the duration had to be increased to three days in 1982, then again in 1987 to four days as the popularity continued to increase.<ref name=\"VetMedicInfographic\" /> Since 1991, the show has been held in the [[National Exhibition Centre]], Birmingham, the first time the show had moved out of London since its inception.<ref name=\"StandHistoryCrufts\" />\n\nIt was also at the Centenary celebrations in 1991 that Crufts was officially recognised by the Guinness Book of Records as the world's largest dog show with 22,973 dogs being exhibited in conformation classes that year. Including agility and other events, it is estimated that an average 28,000 dogs take part in Crufts each year, with an estimated 160,000 human visitors attending the show.<ref name=\"Telegraph10Things\" />\n\nCrufts was formerly televised by the BBC; this ended after the 2008 event (see [[#Criticism|\"Criticism\"]]) and the 2009 event was only shown via the Internet.

There are a number of ways of qualifying for the breed classes at Crufts, but most dogs typically qualify by obtaining first, second or third place in the relevant class at a Kennel Club affiliated Championship show where Challenge Certificates are awarded, or by achieving Best in Show, Reserve Best in Show or Best Puppy in Show at a Kennel Club affiliated Open or General show. Dogs can become qualified for life upon attaining their Kennel Club Stud Book Number.<ref name=\"CruftsQualifications\">{{cite web|title=Crufts: Qualifications|url=http://crufts.org.uk/content/dog-exhibitors/qualification-for-crufts-2018/|website=crufts.org.uk|accessdate=28 September 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"GreatDogsQual\">{{cite web|title=How Can My Dog Compete?|url=http://www.greatdogs.co.uk/howcanmydogcompete.html|website=www.greatdogs.co.uk|accessdate=28 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nDogs compete in hierarchical fashion. Dogs begin by competing against others of the same [[dog breed|breed]], split by gender, age and previous class wins. These classes include ''Veteran'', ''Special Puppy'', ''Special Junior'', ''Yearling'', ''Post Graduate'', ''Mid Limit'', ''Limit'', and ''Open''. Each is awarded once for dogs and once for bitches. The dog and bitch class winners then compete again for the Dog and Bitch Challenge Certificate (CC). The two CC winners then go head-to-head to determine the Best of Breed.<ref name=\"VetMedicInfographic\" />\n\nAfter the best of each breed has been chosen, they then compete against the others in their [[Breed Groups (dog)|Group]] (in the UK, there are seven Groups: Toys, Gundogs, Utility, Hounds, Working, Pastoral, and Terriers) to find the ''[[General Specials|Best in Group]]''. The seven Group winners then compete to find the ''Best in Show'' and ''Reserve Best in Show''.<ref name=\"VetMedicInfographic\" />\n\nBest in Show winners receive a replica of the solid silver Keddall Memorial Trophy, and a small cash prize of \u00a3100.<ref name=\"Telegraph10Things\" />\n\nThe [[English Cocker Spaniel]] is the most successful breed at Crufts, having been awarded Best In Show seven times,<ref name=\"Telegraph10Things\" /><ref name=\"JuliusK9HistoryCrufts\">{{cite web|title=A Brief History of Crufts|url=https://julius-k9.co.uk/blog/a-brief-history-of-crufts/|website=julius-k9.co.uk|accessdate=28 September 2017|language=en}}</ref> and the Gundog Group is the most successful group, having produced 23 Best In Show winners.<ref name=\"JuliusK9HistoryCrufts\" />\n\n== Best in Show winners (since 2006) ==\n{{Main|List of Best in Show winners of Crufts}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Any mistake made by the dog is penalised by adding time to their result. Dogs must qualify during the preceding year to compete in individual or team events, although representative handlers and dogs from England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland are invited to compete in the International competitions.\n\nThere is an [[obedience training|obedience]] competition, now held in its own 'Obedience Arena'. Dogs qualify by being successful at shows during the preceding year to compete in the Dog and Bitch UK Obedience Championships, UK Inter-Regional Team Competition and the crowd's favourite, the Obedience World Cup. The prizes are awarded to the most obedient dog according to the judges after they have undergone various demanding activities, such as off lead heelwork at different paces, distance control, retrieve, send away, stays and scent discrimination.\n\nThe [[Flyball]] competition is a [[relay race|relay]]-style race. Teams of four dogs compete against each other in a knock-out competition. Each dog jumps a series of four hurdles, and then steps on a box, which is rigged to release a ball. The dog must then return the ball to the start of the course to tag one of its team, who then repeats this process until all the dogs have finished. Teams must qualify during the preceding year.\n\nCrufts also hold both [[musical canine freestyle|freestyle]] and [[heelwork to music]] competitions, consisting of a choreographed routine, comprising elements of obedience, set to music.\n\nThe [[gamekeeper]]s classes at Crufts focus on judging the suitability of field-bred dogs for use in the field. Dogs entered are of the [[gundog]] group, but the conformation of these dogs differs significantly from that of gundogs from show-bred bloodlines, owing to the need for function as a working gundog, and they are judged accordingly.<ref name=\"BASC\">{{cite web|title=BASC - BASC at CRUFTS|url=https://basc.org.uk/gundogs/basc-at-crufts/|website=basc.org.uk|accessdate=28 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Young Kennel Club]] (YKC) also has its own ring and stand where handlers aged between 6 and 25 compete in Agility, Obedience, Showing, Handling, Heelwork to Music, Flyball, and Grooming. Handlers and dogs must qualify in their discipline during the preceding year.\n\nCrufts hosts the World Champion Junior Handling competition in which National Best Junior Handler winners from around the globe compete for this esteemed title. Since there is a quarantine to the import of foreign dogs, many competitors must \"borrow\" dogs from gracious British show enthusiasts. The first World title competition, held in 1984, was judged by Ger Pederson. The winner of this premiere competition was US representative Tracie Laliberte who had won Westminster Kennel Club in 1983. A unique feature of this first competition was the requirement of switching dogs mid-way through the competition.\n\n== Other attractions ==\nCrufts drew 160,000 visitors to the NEC in 2008,<ref>{{cite web|title=Crufts 2008|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/birmingham/content/articles/2008/01/24/crufts_2008_feature.shtml|website=BBC Birmingham|accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref> with over 166,000 in 2019.<ref>{{cite web|title=Trade exhibitors|url=https://www.crufts.org.uk/trade-exhibitors|website=www.crufts.org.uk|accessdate=7 March 2020|language=en}}</ref> While the main purpose of the event is the search for the best dog in the show, many trade stands sell a wide range of dog-related merchandise or advertise dog-related charities.<ref name=\"GreatDogsSpecial\">{{cite web|title=What Made Crufts Become So Well Renowed(sic)?|url=http://www.greatdogs.co.uk/WhyIsCruftsSoSpecial.html|website=www.greatdogs.co.uk|accessdate=28 September 2017}}</ref> There is also a section known as [[Discover Dogs]] where visitors can see almost every breed recognised by the Kennel Club on view, and discuss each breed with knowledgeable owners.<ref name=\"CruftsDiscoverDogs\">{{cite web|title=Crufts: Discover +200 Breeds of Dog at Crufts {{!}} Find the Right One For You!|url=http://crufts.org.uk/content/whats-on/discover-dogs-at-crufts/|website=crufts.org.uk|accessdate=28 September 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\nCrufts also holds special shows and demonstrations, where specially trained dogs may perform in front of an audience.<ref name=\"RAFDogDisplay\">{{cite web|title=RAF|url=https://www.raf.mod.uk/news/archive/its-the-lead--up-to-crufts-for-the-raf-police-dogs-06032015|website=www.raf.mod.uk|accessdate=28 September 2017|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170929044430/https://www.raf.mod.uk/news/archive/its-the-lead--up-to-crufts-for-the-raf-police-dogs-06032015|archive-date=29 September 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"BBCEastMidlandsPolice\">{{cite news|last1=Jones|first1=Trystan|title=Police dogs 'boost officers' morale'|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-birmingham-17312265|accessdate=28 September 2017|work=BBC News|date=10 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Crossbreeds==\nAs the Kennel Club also registers [[crossbreed]]s, Crufts also hosts many competitions and displays for crossbreeds.

The host of the series is a [[virtual assistant]], named \"Lana\", who will give the cast the rules they must follow for the season; [[Desiree Burch]] provided voice-over narration.

Once the light turned on, the rules of the retreat were void for the contestant and they were able to explore their connection further. If their connection was strong enough, they were able to have a night at the private suite, but their lights would not turn on during the night, so they still needed to follow the rules.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Two's Company, Three's a ...

The 802 was a production model but only seven were sold between 1958 and 1961. The short-lived 803A was built in 1959 and first delivered in 1960; the 803B was built in 1960 and first delivered in 1961.\n\nOver 200 Elliott 803 computers were delivered to customers, at a unit price of about \u00a329,000 in 1960<ref name=\"ourcomp\">[http://www.ourcomputerheritage.org/ccs-e3x1.pdf Version 3, November 2011  E3X1, Delivery lists and applications of the Elliott 800 series and 503 computers.]</ref> (roughly {{Inflation|UK|29000|1960|r=-3|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}{{Inflation/fn|UK|df=y}}). Most sales were of the 803B version with more parallel paths internally, larger memory and hardware floating-point operations.\n\nThe Elliott 803 was the computer used in the ISI-609, the world's first process or [[industrial control system]], wherein the 803 was a [[data logger]]. It was used for this purpose at the world's first dual-purpose nuclear reactor, the [[N-Reactor]].\n\nA significant number of British universities had an Elliott 803.<ref name=\"hansard-19670306\">{{cite web |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1967/mar/06/computers |title=Computers |last=Roberts |first=Goronwy |publisher=UK Parliament |work=Hansard |date=1967-03-06 |id=HC |volume=742 Deb 06 March 1967 vol 742 cc201-5W |access-date=2017-07-08}}</ref>\n\nElliott subsequently developed the much faster, software compatible, [[Elliott 503]].\n\nTwo complete Elliott 803 computers survive.  One is owned by the [[Science Museum (London)]] but it is not on display to the public.  The second is owned by [[The National Museum of Computing]] (TNMoC) at [[Bletchley Park]], is fully functional, and can regularly be seen in operation by visitors to that museum.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mainframes & large systems |url=http://www.tnmoc.org/explore/mainframes |publisher=TNMOC |accessdate=9 November 2018}}</ref><ref>[http://www.tnmoc.org/news/notes-museum/elliott-803-news-more-tidbits-archive-and-several-generous-donations-boot Elliott 803 news, more tidbits from the archive and several generous donations to boot], 2010-09-19, The National Museum of Computing</ref>\n\n==Hardware description==\n\nThe 803 is a [[Transistor computer|transistorised]], [[serial computer|bit-serial]] machine; the 803B has more parallel paths internally.

Circuitry is based on [[printed circuit boards]] with the circuits being rather simple and most of the signalling carried on wires.  There is a second cabinet about half the size used for the power supply, which is unusually based on a large [[nickel\u2013cadmium battery]] with charger, an early form of [[uninterruptible power supply]]. A third cabinet (the same size as the power cabinet) holds the extra working store on machines with 8192 word stores. There is an operator's [[System console|control console]], [[Creed & Company|Creed]] [[teleprinter]] and high-speed paper [[punched tape]] reader and punch for [[input/output]], using 5-track Elliott telecode code, not [[Baudot code|Baudot]]. Tape is read at 500 characters per second and punched at 100 cps.\nThe operator's console, about 60 inches long, allows low-level instructions to be entered manually to manipulate addresses and data and can start, stop and step the machine: there is a loudspeaker (pulsed by the top bit of the [[instruction register]]) which allows the operator to judge the status of a computation. The system requires [[air conditioning]], drawing about 3.5&nbsp;kW of power in a minimal configuration.

At the time this was in use by the film industry to record sound tracks.  Elliott's factory at Borehamwood was close to the Elstree film studios which explains the use of the 35mm sprocketed media. The 1000-foot reels held 4096 blocks of 64 words per block (4096 x 64 x 39 = 10,223,616 bits, or the equivalent of about 1.27Mbytes).\n\nAnother unusual feature is the use of magnetic cores not only for memory but also as logic gates. These logic cores have 1, 2 or 3 input windings, a trigger (read) and an output winding.  Depending on their polarity, current pulses in the input windings either magnetise the core or cancel each other out. The magnetised state of the core indicates the result of a boolean logic function. [[two-phase clock|Two clock phases]] designated alpha and beta are used to trigger (reset to zero) alternate cores. A change from a one to a zero produces a pulse on the output winding. Cores which receive alpha trigger pulses (alpha cores) have inputs fed from gates which are triggered on the beta phase (beta cores). Transistors were expensive at the time and each logic gate requires only one to amplify the output winding pulse; however a single transistor drives the inputs of a small number of (typically 3) other cores. If more than 3 inputs are to be driven, up to two more transistors can be driven by each core.\n\n==Instruction set==\n\nInstructions and data are based on a 39-bit word length with binary representation in [[Two's complement|2's complement]] arithmetic. The [[instruction set]] operates on a single address and single accumulator register, with an additional auxiliary register for double length integer multiply and divide. Although it is believed that the single length divide and square root instructions were only enabled in 803s destined for process control applications, the one remaining operational 803B has been found to have these instructions enabled, probably because it was used by a software house to develop real time and  process control applications.  An instruction is composed of a 6-bit instruction (conventionally represented in [[octal]]) and a 13 bit address. This gives 64 instructions organised as 8 groups of 8 instructions. The 13-bit memory address field gives an addressable range of 8192 words. These 19-bit instructions are packed two to a word with an additional 39th bit between them, the so-called B-line or B digit (the term is a legacy from the [[Ferranti Mark 1]] computer, where the A-line represented the accumulator and the B-line an instruction modifier, both displayed on a [[Williams tube]]). Setting the B digit has the effect of adding the contents of the memory address of the first instruction to the second instruction at execution time, enabling indirect addressing and other run-time instruction modifications. The bit time is 6 microseconds, jumps execute in 288 microseconds and simple arithmetic instructions in 576 microseconds. Floating-point operations take several milliseconds.  IO is direct and there are no interrupts.\n\nIn the following descriptions, A and N represent the accumulator and the literal address, a and n represent the (initial) contents of the accumulator and addressed store location, and a' and n' the resultant contents.\n\n===Instruction Groups 0 \u2013 3===\n\nThese are fixed point arithmetic with 4 different combinations of operand and result destination:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Groups 0 \u2013 3\n|\n{| style=\"text-align: center; width: 100%\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|-\n|width=\"30\"| '''Fn'''\n|width=\"auto\" align=\"left\"| '''Operation'''\n|width=\"50\"| '''a''''\n|width=\"50\"| '''n''''\n|}\n|\n{| style=\"text-align: center; width: 100%\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|-\n|width=\"30\"| '''Fn'''\n|width=\"auto\" align=\"left\"| '''Operation'''\n|width=\"50\"| '''a''''\n|width=\"50\"| '''n''''\n|}\n|-\n|\n{| style=\"text-align: center; width: 100%\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|-\n|width=\"30\"| 00\n|width=\"auto\" align=\"left\"| Do nothing\n|width=\"50\"| a\n|width=\"50\"| n\n|-\n| 01\n|align=\"left\"| Negate\n| -a\n| n\n|-\n| 02\n|align=\"left\"| Replace & count\n| n + 1\n| n\n|-\n| 03\n|align=\"left\"| Collate\n| a & n\n| n\n|-\n| 04\n|align=\"left\"| Add\n| a + n\n| n\n|-\n| 05\n|align=\"left\"| Subtract\n| a - n\n| n\n|-\n| 06\n|align=\"left\"| Clear\n| zero\n| n\n|-\n| 07\n|align=\"left\"| Negate & add\n| n - a\n| n\n|}\n|\n{| style=\"text-align: center; width: 100%\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|-\n|width=\"30\"| 10\n|width=\"auto\" align=\"left\"| Exchange\n|width=\"50\"| n\n|width=\"50\"| a\n|-\n| 11\n|align=\"left\"| Exchange and negate\n| -n\n| a\n|-\n| 12\n|align=\"left\"| Exchange and count\n| n + 1\n| a\n|-\n| 13\n|align=\"left\"| Write and collate\n| a & n\n| a\n|-\n| 14\n|align=\"left\"| Write and add\n| a + n\n| a\n|-\n| 15\n|align=\"left\"| Write and subtract\n| a - n\n| a\n|-\n| 16\n|align=\"left\"| Write and clear\n| zero\n| a\n|-\n| 17\n|align=\"left\"| Write, negate and add\n| n - a\n| a\n|}\n|-\n|\n{| style=\"text-align: center; width: 100%\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|-\n|width=\"30\"| 20\n|width=\"auto\" align=\"left\"| Write\n|width=\"50\"| a\n|width=\"50\"| a\n|-\n| 21\n|align=\"left\"| Write negatively\n| a\n| -a\n|-\n| 22\n|align=\"left\"| Count in store\n| a\n| n + 1\n|-\n| 23\n|align=\"left\"| Collate in store\n| a\n| a & n\n|-\n| 24\n|align=\"left\"| Add into store\n| a\n| a + n\n|-\n| 25\n|align=\"left\"| Negate store and add\n| a\n| a - n\n|-\n| 26\n|align=\"left\"| Clear store\n| a\n| zero\n|-\n| 27\n|align=\"left\"| Subtract from store\n| a\n| n - a\n|}\n|\n{| style=\"text-align: center; width: 100%\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|-\n|width=\"30\"| 30\n|width=\"auto\" align=\"left\"| Replace\n|width=\"50\"| n\n|width=\"50\"| n\n|-\n| 31\n|align=\"left\"| Replace and negate store\n| n\n| -n\n|-\n| 32\n|align=\"left\"| Replace and count in store\n| n\n| n + 1\n|-\n| 33\n|align=\"left\"| Replace and collate in store\n| n\n| a & n\n|-\n| 34\n|align=\"left\"| Replace and add to store\n| n\n| a + n\n|-\n| 35\n|align=\"left\"| Replace, negate store and add\n| n\n| a - n\n|-\n| 36\n|align=\"left\"| Replace and clear store\n| n\n| zero\n|-\n| 37\n|align=\"left\"| Replace and subtract from store\n| n\n| n - a\n|}\n|}\n\n===Instruction Group 4===\n\nGroup 4 is conditional and unconditional jumps.

Despite the 803 Handbook saying \"All odd functions in Group 5 clear the AR\", function 57 does not clear it.   \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Group 5\n|\n{| style=\"text-align: left; width: 100%\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|-\n|width=\"30\" align=\"center\"| '''Fn'''\n|width=\"auto\"| '''Operation'''\n|}\n|-\n|\n{| style=\"text-align: left\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|valign=\"top\"   width=\"30\" align=\"center\"| 50\n|width=\"auto\"| Arithmetic right shift a/ar N times\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"   align=\"center\"| 51\n| Logical right shift a N times, clear ar\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"   align=\"center\"| 52\n| Multiply a by n, result to a/ar\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"   align=\"center\"| 53\n| Multiply a by n, single length rounded result to a, clear ar\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"   align=\"center\"| 54\n| Arithmetic left shift a/ar N times\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"   align=\"center\"| 55\n| Logical left shift a N times, clear ar\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"   align=\"center\"| 56\n| Divide a/ar by n, single length quotient to a, clear ar\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"   align=\"center\"| 57\n| Copy ar to a, set sign bit zero, do NOT clear the ar\n|}\n|}\n\n===Instruction Group 6===\n\nGroup 6 is floating-point instructions (if a floating-point unit is installed).\n\nFloating-point numbers are represented in a 39-bit word or in the accumulator as (from most to least significant end):\n* a 30 bit 2's complement signed mantissa a in the range \u00bd \u2264 a &lt; 1 or -1 \u2264 a &lt; -\u00bd\n* a 9 bit signed exponent b represented as a positive integer 0 \u2264 (b+256) \u2264 511.\nZero is always represented by all 39 bits zero.\n\nNote that the test for zero and test for negative jump instructions are equally valid for floating-point.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Group 6\n|\n{| style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: top; width: 100%\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|-\n|width=\"30\"| '''Fn'''\n|width=\"auto\" align=\"left\"| '''Operation'''\n|width=\"50\"| '''a''''\n|width=\"50\"| '''n''''\n|}\n|-\n|\n{| style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: top;\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|valign=\"top\"  width=\"30\"| 60\n|width=\"auto\" align=\"left\"| Add n to a\n|width=\"50\"| a + n\n|width=\"50\"| n\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"| 61\n|align=\"left\"| Subtract n from a\n| a - n\n| n\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"| 62\n|align=\"left\"| Negate a and add n\n| n - a\n| n\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"| 63\n|align=\"left\"| Multiply a by n\n| a * n\n| n\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"| 64\n|align=\"left\"| Divide a by n\n| a / n\n| n\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"| 65\n|align=\"left\"| N = 4096: Convert fixed point integer in the accumulator to floating-point\n|\n|\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"| 65\n|align=\"left\"| N < 4096: Fast left (end round) shift N mod 64 places    \n| \n|\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"| 66\n|align=\"left\"| (Spare)\n|\n|\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"| 67\n|align=\"left\"| (Spare)\n|\n|\n|}\n|}\nAll these instructions clear the auxiliary register.\n\n===Instruction Group 7===\n\nGroup 7 is input/output, with the exception of 73, which is used for subroutine linkage.

In accordance with the 803 convention, it is written with two instructions on each line, representing the contents of one word. The colon or slash between them represent a B digit value of zero or one respectively.\n<pre>\n 0:  26 4 : 06 0    Clear loc'n 4; Clear A\n 1:  22 4 / 16 3    Increment loc 4; Store A in loc'n (3 + content of loc'n 4) & clear A\n 2:  55 5 : 71 0    Left shift A 5 times; Read tape and \"or\" into A\n 3:  43 1 : 40 2    Jump to loc'n 1 if arith overflow; Jump to loc'n 2\n</pre>\nThere are several points to note in this very simple program:\n* There is no count. The inner loop (locations 2 and 3) packs 5-bit characters into the accumulator until overflow occurs. Thus a 39 bit word is formed of eight 5 bit characters. The most significant bit of the first character is discarded but must be a 1 (unless the next bit is a 1), in order to provoke arithmetic overflow (a change of the sign bit).\n* The first word read is stored into location 4, and this is then used as the address into which subsequent words are stored.\n* Blank leading and trailing tape is ignored since zeroes can be shifted left indefinitely without causing overflow.\n* There is no provision to terminate the outer loop (inner loop plus location 1). The tape can be stopped manually, or allowed to run out through the reader (since the blank trailer is ignored). More usually, Initial Instructions are used to read a more sophisticated secondary bootstrap (T23) into the top of store. After writing to the last store location (8191) the address is allowed to wrap round to 0. Writing zero to locations 0 \u2013 3 has no effect (since the contents of these locations are created by logic gates rather than being read from the core store), and a special value is then written to location 4. This value has 22 in the function code bits and the secondary bootstrap entry point minus 3 in the address bits. This means that the B digit has the effect of transforming the 16 (store) instruction in location 1 into a 40 (jump) instruction (16 + 22 = 40 in octal), and of adding 3 to the address bits. The net result is a jump to the entry point of the secondary bootstrap!\n\n(The data values for the wrapped-around locations 0 \u2013 3 must be zero since counter values 8192, 8193 etc. change the B-modified second half of location 1 from a 16 to a 17 instruction, which sets a to n - a instead of clearing it, as required by the inner loop.)\n\n===Interrupts===\n\nThe 803 has a little-known interrupt facility. Whilst it is not mentioned in the programming guide and is not used by any of the standard peripherals, the operation of the interrupt logic is described in the 803 hardware handbooks and the logic is shown in the 803 maintenance diagrams (Diagram 1:LB7 Gb).  Interrupts are probably used mostly in conjunction with custom interfaces provided as part of ARCH real time process control systems. Since all input and output instructions causes the 803 to become \"busy\" if input data is not available or if an output device has not completed a previous operation, interrupts are not needed and are not used for driving the standard peripherals.\n\nRaising the interrupt input to the computer causes a break in execution as follows: as soon as the machine is in a suitable state (in particular, when not \"busy\" and only in certain states of the fetch/execute cycle), the next instruction pair is fetched from store location 5, without changing the Sequence Control Register (SCR).  Location 5 is expected to contain a standard subroutine entry instruction pair (73 LINK : 40 N \u2013 see above), allowing the pre-interrupt execution address (still in the SCR) to be saved for later return. The external equipment raising the interrupt is relied upon to refrain from raising another interrupt until the first has been acknowledged by some suitable input/output instruction, so as to prevent interrupts from being nested. The Algol compiler does not regard location 5 as a reserved location, although this may have more to do with the unsuitability of Algol for process control applications than indicating that interrupts are never regarded as a mainstream facility.\n\n==Compilers==\nThe ''Initial Instructions'' described as the Example Program above is effectively a primary bootloader which is normally used to read a secondary bootloader known as ''T23'', prepended to all program tapes. T23 allows more flexible program loading facilities including sumchecking of the loaded code.\n\nMachine code programs are written in an octal/decimal representation exemplified in the Example Program above, and loaded by a rudimentary assembler known as the ''Translation Input Routine''. It has no symbolic addressing facilities, but instead allows the source to be broken into ''blocks'' which can be manually relocated to allow for the expansion or contraction of a previous block in development. There is also an [[Autocode]] for simple programming tasks, allowing faster program development without the need for a knowledge of machine code. This has no formula translation facilities and requires all calculations to be reduced to a series of assignments with no more than a single operator on the right hand side.\n\nThe 803B with 8192 words of memory is capable of running the Elliott [[ALGOL]] compiler,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billp.org/ccs/A104/ |title=Elliott 803 Algol |first=Bill |last=Purvis |date=2005-10-05}}</ref> a major subset of the Algol60 language, capable of loading and running several ALGOL programs in succession. This was largely written by [[C. A. R. Hoare|Tony Hoare]], employed by Elliotts as a programmer in August 1960.  Hoare recounts some of his experiences at Elliotts in his 1980 [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM) [[Turing Award]] lecture.\n\nThe 803B at The National Museum of Computing is now working well enough to run this [[compiler]] again. There is a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxZ1i8pvZI short video] on YouTube of it compiling and running a simple program.\n\n== NCR involvement ==\n\nThe 803 was branded as the NCR-Elliott 803 when sold by NCR for commercial use. At this time, Elliott Automation were also making/assembling NCR 315's at Borehamwood.\n\n=== Do-it-yourself computing ===\n\nElliott 803's (and later Elliott 4100's) were used in NCR-Elliott's joint venture \"Computer Workshop\" computer bureau. The unique feature of this bureau was that they ran 3-day courses to teach their customers to write their own programmes, and these were often donated to a library of programmes that could be used. Customers would come to Borehamwood (and later Greenford) to operate the computers themselves \u2013 an early example of personal computing. Prices per hour were 8\u00a3 ({{Inflation|UK|8|1960|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}) from 9 am to 5 pm, 6\u00a3 ({{Inflation|UK|6|1960|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}) from 5 pm to midnight, and 4\u00a3 ({{Inflation|UK|4|1960|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}) from midnight to 9 am.{{Inflation/fn|UK|df=y}}\n\nThe most popular applications were in civil engineering and architecture, for structural analysis, cut and fill, survey correction, and bills of quantities.\n\n== Applications ==\nThe following were 803 users:<ref name=\"ourcomp\"/>\n* RMIT Melbourne utilised an Elliott 803 Computer for student use in 1966.\n* Brush Electrical Machines in Loughborough UK used an 803 for design calculation on power transformers and motors.\n* G.P.O. used an 803 at their Dollis Hill Research Labs for electronics design and telephone network simulations.\n* G.P.O. used an 803 at their Goonhiily Downs satellite earth station for calculating satellite passes and punching tapes to steer dishes.\n* Corah Knitware in Leicester UK used a pair of 803s for telephone order processing and production planning.\n* Thornber Farms in West Yorkshire UK used an 803 to process egg production data for breeding of chickens.<ref>[http://www.britishpathe.com/record.php?id=41973 Science and the Egg, Aka Chick Automation: Science Aids The Egg], Issue Date: 12/02/1962 \u2013 British Path\u00e9</ref>\n* Vickers da Costa, a London stockbroker, used an 803B for trade processing and payroll from 1961 to 1966 when it was replaced with a National Elliot 4300.\n* The RAF No1 Radio School RAF Locking used an 803 in 1968 to train the first RAF Computer Technician Apprentices.\n* The Medical Research Council Biophysics Research Unit at King's College London in Drury Lane used an 803 for detailed calculations to verify the structure of DNA and in early attempts to sequence RNA.<ref>Described in 'University of London King's College Biophysics Laboratories' (1964) HMSO pp 9-11.</ref>\n* United Steel's (later British Steel) [[Swinden House]] Laboratories  in Rotherham took delivery of an 803 in 1963.

They were used to teach Elliott Autocode as a primary language but also had an ALGOL compiler. The machines last ran in 1980 when they were replaced by a classroom full of BBC B's. The school also acquired the machine from Loughborough University for spares.\n* Felsted School once had two Elliott 803's, nowadays only the control console remains, it is hung up in the corner of one of the school's current IT rooms as a reminder to why the room is named \"Elliott\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://members.iinet.net.au/~humbert/thesis/chapter3/Chapter3.html |title=Practical Applications for School-based Intranets |last=Humbert |first=Pete}}</ref>\n* [[Haydon School]] had two Elliot 803B's with 8192 words of core until the early-1980s, one being used for spare parts. One of them came from the nearby Brunel University. Peripherals included two film handlers, two optical readers, two punches and a teleprinter for output, a hardware square-root unit and a drum plotter. It was used for running Algol, Autoode and a BASIC and Fortran compilers were available. It was installed in the early 1970s under the care of the Physics Department. At the time it was still [[St Nicholas Grammar School]] for boys.\n* [[Mill Hill School]] had an Elliott 803 with 8192 memory in the 1970s.

Circuitry is based on [[printed circuit boards]] with the circuits being rather simple and most of the signalling carried on wires.  There is a second cabinet about half the size used for the power supply, which is unusually based on a large [[nickel\u2013cadmium battery]] with charger, an early form of [[uninterruptible power supply]]. A third cabinet (the same size as the power cabinet) holds the extra working store on machines with 8192 word stores.

At the time this was in use by the film industry to record sound tracks.  Elliott's factory at Borehamwood was close to the Elstree film studios which explains the use of the 35mm sprocketed media. The 1000-foot reels held 4096 blocks of 64 words per block (4096 x 64 x 39 = 10,223,616 bits, or the equivalent of about 1.27Mbytes).\n\nAnother unusual feature is the use of magnetic cores not only for memory but also as logic gates. These logic cores have 1, 2 or 3 input windings, a trigger (read) and an output winding.  Depending on their polarity, current pulses in the input windings either magnetise the core or cancel each other out. The magnetised state of the core indicates the result of a boolean logic function. [[two-phase clock|Two clock phases]] designated alpha and beta are used to trigger (reset to zero) alternate cores. A change from a one to a zero produces a pulse on the output winding. Cores which receive alpha trigger pulses (alpha cores) have inputs fed from gates which are triggered on the beta phase (beta cores). Transistors were expensive at the time and each logic gate requires only one to amplify the output winding pulse; however a single transistor drives the inputs of a small number of (typically 3) other cores. If more than 3 inputs are to be driven, up to two more transistors can be driven by each core.\n\n==Instruction set==\n\nInstructions and data are based on a 39-bit word length with binary representation in [[Two's complement|2's complement]] arithmetic. The [[instruction set]] operates on a single address and single accumulator register, with an additional auxiliary register for double length integer multiply and divide. Although it is believed that the single length divide and square root instructions were only enabled in 803s destined for process control applications, the one remaining operational 803B has been found to have these instructions enabled, probably because it was used by a software house to develop real time and  process control applications.  An instruction is composed of a 6-bit instruction (conventionally represented in [[octal]]) and a 13 bit address. This gives 64 instructions organised as 8 groups of 8 instructions. The 13-bit memory address field gives an addressable range of 8192 words. These 19-bit instructions are packed two to a word with an additional 39th bit between them, the so-called B-line or B digit (the term is a legacy from the [[Ferranti Mark 1]] computer, where the A-line represented the accumulator and the B-line an instruction modifier, both displayed on a [[Williams tube]]). Setting the B digit has the effect of adding the contents of the memory address of the first instruction to the second instruction at execution time, enabling indirect addressing and other run-time instruction modifications. The bit time is 6 microseconds, jumps execute in 288 microseconds and simple arithmetic instructions in 576 microseconds. Floating point operations take several milliseconds.  IO is direct and there are no interrupts.\n\nIn the following descriptions, A and N represent the accumulator and the literal address, a and n represent the (initial) contents of the accumulator and addressed store location, and a' and n' the resultant contents.\n\n===Instruction Groups 0 \u2013 3===\n\nThese are fixed point arithmetic with 4 different combinations of operand and result destination:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Groups 0 \u2013 3\n|\n{| style=\"text-align: center; width: 100%\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|-\n|width=\"30\"| '''Fn'''\n|width=\"auto\" align=\"left\"| '''Operation'''\n|width=\"50\"| '''a''''\n|width=\"50\"| '''n''''\n|}\n|\n{| style=\"text-align: center; width: 100%\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|-\n|width=\"30\"| '''Fn'''\n|width=\"auto\" align=\"left\"| '''Operation'''\n|width=\"50\"| '''a''''\n|width=\"50\"| '''n''''\n|}\n|-\n|\n{| style=\"text-align: center; width: 100%\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|-\n|width=\"30\"| 00\n|width=\"auto\" align=\"left\"| Do nothing\n|width=\"50\"| a\n|width=\"50\"| n\n|-\n| 01\n|align=\"left\"| Negate\n| -a\n| n\n|-\n| 02\n|align=\"left\"| Replace & count\n| n + 1\n| n\n|-\n| 03\n|align=\"left\"| Collate\n| a & n\n| n\n|-\n| 04\n|align=\"left\"| Add\n| a + n\n| n\n|-\n| 05\n|align=\"left\"| Subtract\n| a - n\n| n\n|-\n| 06\n|align=\"left\"| Clear\n| zero\n| n\n|-\n| 07\n|align=\"left\"| Negate & add\n| n - a\n| n\n|}\n|\n{| style=\"text-align: center; width: 100%\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|-\n|width=\"30\"| 10\n|width=\"auto\" align=\"left\"| Exchange\n|width=\"50\"| n\n|width=\"50\"| a\n|-\n| 11\n|align=\"left\"| Exchange and negate\n| -n\n| a\n|-\n| 12\n|align=\"left\"| Exchange and count\n| n + 1\n| a\n|-\n| 13\n|align=\"left\"| Write and collate\n| a & n\n| a\n|-\n| 14\n|align=\"left\"| Write and add\n| a + n\n| a\n|-\n| 15\n|align=\"left\"| Write and subtract\n| a - n\n| a\n|-\n| 16\n|align=\"left\"| Write and clear\n| zero\n| a\n|-\n| 17\n|align=\"left\"| Write, negate and add\n| n - a\n| a\n|}\n|-\n|\n{| style=\"text-align: center; width: 100%\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|-\n|width=\"30\"| 20\n|width=\"auto\" align=\"left\"| Write\n|width=\"50\"| a\n|width=\"50\"| a\n|-\n| 21\n|align=\"left\"| Write negatively\n| a\n| -a\n|-\n| 22\n|align=\"left\"| Count in store\n| a\n| n + 1\n|-\n| 23\n|align=\"left\"| Collate in store\n| a\n| a & n\n|-\n| 24\n|align=\"left\"| Add into store\n| a\n| a + n\n|-\n| 25\n|align=\"left\"| Negate store and add\n| a\n| a - n\n|-\n| 26\n|align=\"left\"| Clear store\n| a\n| zero\n|-\n| 27\n|align=\"left\"| Subtract from store\n| a\n| n - a\n|}\n|\n{| style=\"text-align: center; width: 100%\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|-\n|width=\"30\"| 30\n|width=\"auto\" align=\"left\"| Replace\n|width=\"50\"| n\n|width=\"50\"| n\n|-\n| 31\n|align=\"left\"| Replace and negate store\n| n\n| -n\n|-\n| 32\n|align=\"left\"| Replace and count in store\n| n\n| n + 1\n|-\n| 33\n|align=\"left\"| Replace and collate in store\n| n\n| a & n\n|-\n| 34\n|align=\"left\"| Replace and add to store\n| n\n| a + n\n|-\n| 35\n|align=\"left\"| Replace, negate store and add\n| n\n| a - n\n|-\n| 36\n|align=\"left\"| Replace and clear store\n| n\n| zero\n|-\n| 37\n|align=\"left\"| Replace and subtract from store\n| n\n| n - a\n|}\n|}\n\n===Instruction Group 4===\n\nGroup 4 is conditional and unconditional jumps.

In accordance with the 803 convention, it is written with two instructions on each line, representing the contents of one word. The colon or slash between them represent a B digit value of zero or one respectively.\n<pre>\n 0:  26 4 : 06 0    Clear loc'n 4; Clear A\n 1:  22 4 / 16 3    Increment loc 4; Store A in loc'n (3 + content of loc'n 4) & clear A\n 2:  55 5 : 71 0    Left shift A 5 times; Read tape and \"or\" into A\n 3:  43 1 : 40 2    Jump to loc'n 1 if arith overflow; Jump to loc'n 2\n</pre>\nThere are several points to note in this very simple program:\n* There is no count. The inner loop (locations 2 and 3) packs 5-bit characters into the accumulator until overflow occurs. Thus a 39 bit word is formed of eight 5 bit characters. The most significant bit of the first character is discarded but must be a 1 (unless the next bit is a 1), in order to provoke arithmetic overflow (a change of the sign bit).\n* The first word read is stored into location 4, and this is then used as the address into which subsequent words are stored.\n* Blank leading and trailing tape is ignored since zeroes can be shifted left indefinitely without causing overflow.\n* There is no provision to terminate the outer loop (inner loop plus location 1). The tape can be stopped manually, or allowed to run out through the reader (since the blank trailer is ignored). More usually, Initial Instructions are used to read a more sophisticated secondary bootstrap (T23) into the top of store. After writing to the last store location (8191) the address is allowed to wrap round to 0. Writing zero to locations 0 \u2013 3 has no effect (since the contents of these locations are created by logic gates rather than being read from the core store), and a special value is then written to location 4. This value has 22 in the function code bits and the secondary bootstrap entry point minus 3 in the address bits. This means that the B digit has the effect of transforming the 16 (store) instruction in location 1 into a 40 (jump) instruction (16 + 22 = 40 in octal), and of adding 3 to the address bits. The net result is a jump to the entry point of the secondary bootstrap!\n\n(The data values for the wrapped-around locations 0 \u2013 3 must be zero since counter values 8192, 8193 etc. change the B-modified second half of location 1 from a 16 to a 17 instruction, which sets a to n - a instead of clearing it, as required by the inner loop.)\n\n===Interrupts===\n\nThe 803 has a little-known interrupt facility. Whilst it is not mentioned in the programming guide and is not used by any of the standard peripherals, the operation of the interrupt logic is described in the 803 hardware handbooks and the logic is shown in the 803 maintenance diagrams (Diagram 1:LB7 Gb).  Interrupts are probably used mostly in conjunction with custom interfaces provided as part of ARCH real time process control systems. Since all input and output instructions causes the 803 to become \"busy\" if input data is not available or if an output device has not completed a previous operation, interrupts are not needed and are not used for driving the standard peripherals.\n\nRaising the interrupt input to the computer causes a break in execution as follows: as soon as the machine is in a suitable state (in particular, when not \"busy\" and only in certain states of the fetch/execute cycle), the next instruction pair is fetched from store location 5, without changing the Sequence Control Register (SCR).  Location 5 is expected to contain a standard subroutine entry instruction pair (73 LINK : 40 N \u2013 see above), allowing the pre-interrupt execution address (still in the SCR) to be saved for later return. The external equipment raising the interrupt is relied upon to refrain from raising another interrupt until the first has been acknowledged by some suitable input/output instruction, so as to prevent interrupts from being nested. The Algol compiler does not regard location 5 as a reserved location, although this may have more to do with the unsuitability of Algol for process control applications than indicating that interrupts are never regarded as a mainstream facility.\n\n==Compilers==\nThe ''Initial Instructions'' described as the Example Program above is effectively a primary bootloader which is normally used to read a secondary bootloader known as ''T23'', prepended to all program tapes. T23 allows more flexible program loading facilities including sumchecking of the loaded code.\n\nMachine code programs are written in an octal/decimal representation exemplified in the Example Program above, and loaded by a rudimentary assembler known as the ''Translation Input Routine''. It has no symbolic addressing facilities, but instead allows the source to be broken into ''blocks'' which can be manually relocated to allow for the expansion or contraction of a previous block in development. There is also an [[Autocode]] for simple programming tasks, allowing faster program development without the need for a knowledge of machine code. This has no formula translation facilities and requires all calculations to be reduced to a series of assignments with no more than a single operator on the right hand side.\n\nThe 803B with 8192 words of memory is capable of running the Elliott [[ALGOL]] compiler,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billp.org/ccs/A104/ |title=Elliott 803 Algol |first=Bill |last=Purvis |date=2005-10-05}}</ref> a major subset of the Algol60 language, capable of loading and running several ALGOL programs in succession. This was largely written by [[C. A. R. Hoare|Tony Hoare]], employed by Elliotts as a programmer in August 1960.  Hoare recounts some of his experiences at Elliotts in his 1980 [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM) [[Turing Award]] lecture.\n\nThe 803B at The National Museum of Computing is now working well enough to run this [[compiler]] again. There is a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxZ1i8pvZI short video] on YouTube of it compiling and running a simple program.\n\n== NCR involvement ==\n\nThe 803 was branded as the NCR-Elliott 803 when sold by NCR for commercial use.

The unique feature of this bureau was that they ran 3-day courses to teach their customers to write their own programmes, and these were often donated to a library of programmes that could be used. Customers would come to Borehamwood (and later Greenford) to operate the computers themselves \u2013 an early example of personal computing.
