It comprises two [[glass]] bulbs connected vertically by a narrow neck that allows a regulated flow of a substance (historically [[sand]]) from the upper bulb to the lower one. Typically the upper and lower bulbs are symmetric so that the hourglass will measure the same duration regardless of orientation. The specific duration of time a given hourglass measures is determined by factors including the quantity and coarseness of the particulate matter, the bulb size, and the neck width.\n\nDepictions of an hourglass as a symbol of the passage of time are found in art, especially on tombstones or other monuments, from antiquity to the present day.{{cn|date=October 2019}} The form of a winged hourglass has been used as a literal depiction of the well-known Latin epitaph ''[[tempus fugit]]'' (\"time flies\").\n\n==History==\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n[[File:Peleus-Thetis-350.jpg|thumb|[[Sarcophagus]] dated c. 350 AD, representing the wedding of Peleus and Thetis (observe the magnification with the object held by Morpheus in his hands)]]\n\nThe origin of the hourglass is unclear.

As the use of mechanical clocks to indicate the times of events like church services became more common, creating a \"need to keep track of time\", the demand for time-measuring devices increased. Hourglasses were essentially inexpensive, as they required no rare technology to make and their contents were not hard to come by, and as the manufacturing of these instruments became more common, their uses became more practical.<ref name=\"Balmer\" />\n\nHourglasses were commonly seen in use in churches, homes, and work places to measure sermons, cooking time, and time spent on breaks from labor.<ref name=\"Mills\" /> Because they were being used for more everyday tasks, the model of the hourglass began to shrink. The smaller models were more practical and very popular as they made timing more discreet.\n\nAfter 1500, the hourglass was not as widespread as it had been. This was due to the development of the mechanical clock, which became more accurate, smaller and cheaper, and made keeping time easier.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} The hourglass, however, did not disappear entirely. Although they became relatively less useful as clock technology advanced, hourglasses remained desirable in their design. The oldest known surviving hourglass resides in the [[British Museum]] in London.<ref name=\"Mills\" />\n\nNot until the 18th century did [[John Harrison]] come up with a [[marine chronometer]] that significantly improved on the stability of the hourglass at sea. Taking elements from the design logic behind the hourglass, he made a marine chronometer in 1761 that was able to accurately measure the journey from England to Jamaica accurate within five seconds.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n{{clear}}\n[[File:Clessidra 1849.jpg|thumb|19th century hourglass]]\n\n==Design==\nLittle written evidence exists to explain why its external form is the shape that it is. The glass bulbs used, however, have changed in style and design over time. While the main designs have always been [[ampoule]] in shape, the bulbs were not always connected. The first hourglasses were two separate bulbs with a cord wrapped at their union that was then coated in wax to hold the piece together and let sand flow in between.<ref name=\"Hourglass\">http://www.madehow.com/Volume-5/Hourglass.html</ref> It was not until 1760 that both bulbs were blown together to keep moisture out of the bulbs and regulate the pressure within the bulb that varied the flow.<ref name=\"Balmer\" />\n\n==Material==\nWhile some early hourglasses actually did use sand as the granular mixture to measure time, many did not use sand at all. The material used in most bulbs was a combination of \"powdered marble, tin/lead oxides, and pulverized, burnt eggshell\".<ref name=\"Mills\" /> Over time, different textures of granule matter were tested to see which gave the most constant flow within the bulbs. It was later discovered that for the perfect flow to be achieved the ratio of granule bead to the width of the bulb neck needed to be 1/12 or more but not greater than 1/2 the neck of the bulb.<ref>Peterson, Ivars. \"Trickling sand: how an hourglass ticks\".

Hourglasses were essentially inexpensive, as they required no rare technology to make and their contents were not hard to come by, and as the manufacturing of these instruments became more common, their uses became more practical.<ref name=\"Balmer\" />\n\nHourglasses were commonly seen in use in churches, homes, and work places to measure sermons, cooking time, and time spent on breaks from labor.<ref name=\"Mills\" /> Because they were being used for more everyday tasks, the model of the hourglass began to shrink. The smaller models were more practical and very popular as they made timing more discreet.\n\nAfter 1500, the hourglass was not as widespread as it had been. This was due to the development of the mechanical clock, which became more accurate, smaller and cheaper, and made keeping time easier.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} The hourglass, however, did not disappear entirely. Although they became relatively less useful as clock technology advanced, hourglasses remained desirable in their design. The oldest known surviving hourglass resides in the [[British Museum]] in London.<ref name=\"Mills\" />\n\nNot until the 18th century did [[John Harrison]] come up with a [[marine chronometer]] that significantly improved on the stability of the hourglass at sea. Taking elements from the design logic behind the hourglass, he made a marine chronometer in 1761 that was able to accurately measure the journey from England to Jamaica accurate within five seconds.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n{{clear}}\n[[File:Clessidra 1849.jpg|thumb|19th century hourglass]]\n\n==Design==\nLittle written evidence exists to explain why its external form is the shape that it is. The glass bulbs used, however, have changed in style and design over time. While the main designs have always been [[ampoule]] in shape, the bulbs were not always connected. The first hourglasses were two separate bulbs with a cord wrapped at their union that was then coated in wax to hold the piece together and let sand flow in between.<ref name=\"Hourglass\">http://www.madehow.com/Volume-5/Hourglass.html</ref> It was not until 1760 that both bulbs were blown together to keep moisture out of the bulbs and regulate the pressure within the bulb that varied the flow.<ref name=\"Balmer\" />\n\n==Material==\nWhile some early hourglasses actually did use sand as the granular mixture to measure time, many did not use sand at all. The material used in most bulbs was a combination of \"powdered marble, tin/lead oxides, and pulverized, burnt eggshell\".<ref name=\"Mills\" /> Over time, different textures of granule matter were tested to see which gave the most constant flow within the bulbs. It was later discovered that for the perfect flow to be achieved the ratio of granule bead to the width of the bulb neck needed to be 1/12 or more but not greater than 1/2 the neck of the bulb.<ref>Peterson, Ivars. \"Trickling sand: how an hourglass ticks\".

The production was notable for matching the farcical plot with 1950s pop songs by [[Frank Sinatra|Sinatra]], [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]], [[Patsy Cline]], and [[Fats Domino]] and making Arden's friend Franklin a woman, playing up sexual subtext inherent in their scenes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Shakespeare's 'The Murder of Thomas Arden of Faversham' coming to Kenilworth Library, July 20|url=http://www.nj.com/suburbannews/index.ssf/2015/07/shakespeares_the_murder_of_tho.html|website=NJ.com|publisher=Suburban News|date=15 July 2015}}</ref>\n* In May 2018, Maiden Thought Theatre performed it in their home town of Bremen (Germany), setting it to original music by Frances Byrd as a homage to the genre of Film Noir, playing out more of the comedic elements of the play.

{"title_page": "Real F\u00e1brica del Buen Retiro", "text_new": "[[File:Marsyas and Apollo, apparently but unidentified - Museo Nacional de Artes Decorativas - Madrid, Spain - DSC08404.JPG|thumb|right|''[[Apollo]] and [[Marsyas]]'', 1760s.]]\n'''Real F\u00e1brica del Buen Retiro''' (popularly called ''La China''; \"Buen Retiro Porcelain Factory\"; alternatively, '''Real Fabrica de Porcelana del Buen Retiro''') was a [[porcelain]] manufacturing factory in [[Spain]]. It was located in Madrid's [[Parque del Buen Retiro, Madrid]] on a site near the ''[[Fuente del \u00c1ngel Ca\u00eddo]]''.\n\nThe factory began by moving the [[Capodimonte porcelain]] factory from [[Naples]] in 1760, after its founder there had inherited the Spanish throne as [[Carlos III of Spain]]. He took the equipment and about 4000 key workers, including [[Giuseppe Gricci]] (c. 1700\u20131770), the main modeller, and nearly five tons of porcelain paste.  Since the paste, the main artists, and the fleur-de-lys factory mark, were all used by both factories, distinguishing between their products from the years around the move can be very difficult.  The factory continued to make [[Soft-paste porcelain|soft paste porcelain]] until 1803, when it switched to [[hard-paste porcelain]]; some pieces made were in fact [[creamware]], an English style of fine [[earthenware]].<ref>Battie, 104\u2013105; Le Corbellier, 29</ref> \n[[File:12 Aranjuez (41).JPG|thumb|Porcelain room in the [[Palace of Aranjuez]], by [[Giuseppe Gricci|Gricci]], 1763-1765]]\n\nThe factory concentrated on figurines, especially of classical subjects, but also made tablewares and decorative vessels such as vases and pots.  Porcelain rooms were installed at three royal palaces. Initially Gricci's style remained similar to the elegant [[Rococo]] of his Naples works, but soon the newly-fashionable [[Neoclassicism]] became dominant, which remained the case throughout the life of the factory.\n\nAfter the disruptions of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], in 1817 the factory moved a short distance across Madrid to become the [[Royal Factory of La Moncloa]], again taking such moulds and equipment as survived, and the employees.  This operated until 1849.\n\n==Porcelain rooms==\n[[File:Palace-266629.jpg|thumb|Porcelain room in the [[Palacio Real, Madrid]], designed by Carlo Schepers in the 1770s]]\nGricci had made a [[chinoiserie]] porcelain room, the [[Porcelain boudoir of Maria Amalia of Saxony]], at the [[Palace of Portici]] near Naples (now moved to the [[Palace of Capodimonte]]), and was soon asked to make another one at the [[Palace of Aranjuez]], which he made and installed between 1763 and 1765, at a cost of 571,555 Spanish reales.<ref>Battie, 104</ref>  The factory made another room, rather smaller and in a [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] style, for the main [[Palacio Real, Madrid]]. This was designed by Carlo Schepers in the 1770s, and cost 256,958 reales.<ref>Battie, 104</ref>  Both these had walls largely of plain white plaques, over which lay a network of coloured elements in a medium to high [[relief]], made up of plant motifs and figures.  \n\nThe room at the small [[Casita del Pr\u00edncipe (El Escorial)|Casita del Principe, El Escorial]] was again Neoclassical, but with a very different appearance. The walls were almost entirely covered by 234 plaques in the style and technique of [[Wedgwood]]'s [[jasperware]], with a \"Wedgwood blue\" ground and the design in white [[biscuit porcelain]] in low [[relief]]. These were applied as [[Sprigging (pottery)|sprigs]], meaning that they made separately as thin pieces, and stuck to the main blue body before firing.  The plaques are framed like paintings; they were made between 1790 and 1795.<ref>[https://cvc.cervantes.es/actcult/patrimonio/ceramica/buen_retiro/casita_principe/ \"Sala de Porcelana de la Casita del Pr\u00edncipe de El Escorial\"], in Spanish, [https://cvc.cervantes.es/actcult/patrimonio/ceramica/buen_retiro/casita_principe/indice.htm with pages of images here]</ref>\n\n==History==\n===1700s===\nThe factory was founded in 1760 on a site in the Buen Retiro park which at that time was the private gardens of a royal palace on the outskirts of Madrid.<ref name=\" Campbell, 2006\">{{cite book|last= Campbell |first= Gordon  |title= The Volume 2 of The Grove Encyclopedia of Decorative Arts |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=R8BMW6Au7pQC&pg=PA256&lpg=PA256&dq=Real+Fabrica+del+Buen+Retiro&source=bl&ots=jh2t5vhepG&sig=TjpZFG0-rXkElAtN6b58F8E64pU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=RlZTUNyjAunriQK4toGQDw&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Real%20Fabrica%20del%20Buen%20Retiro&f=false|year=2006|publisher= Oxford University Press |isbn= 9780195189483|page =118}}</ref> It was an initiative of [[Carlos III of Spain]], who succeeded to the Spanish throne in 1759, and his wife, [[Maria Amalia of Saxony]].\n[[File:Estanque-grande.jpg|thumb|The factory in the [[Buen Retiro Park]], centre, beyond the lake]] \nPrior to becoming King of Spain, Charles reigned as King of Naples and Sicily.  A similar factory, the [[Capodimonte porcelain|Porcellana di Capodimonte]], had been established by the royal couple in Naples.  Maria Amalia died in 1760, a year after moving to Madrid with her husband, but she was an important influence on both the Naples and the Madrid factories.<ref>She was a member of the Wettin [[Electors of Saxony]] who had established the [[Meissen porcelain|porcelain factory at Meissen]].</ref>  53 specialized [[Italian people|Italian]] craftsmen from [[Naples]] came to Madrid, along with three shipments containing the necessary equipment and special paste, to establish a factory to produce royal porcelain in Madrid. Gaetano Schepers was in charge of the factory and ten Spanish artists were also associated with the manufacturing. The porcelain's quality was internationally recognized, and its manufacturing techniques were kept a state secret.  Buen Retiro porcelain was one of the products that drove [[Mercantilism|mercantilist]] royal policy during the Spanish [[Age of Enlightenment]].  There were other factories in the Madrid area producing luxuries such as tapestries, glass etc.\n\n===1800s===\n[[File:Myth of Prometheus, Esteban Agreda, Real Fabrica del Buen Retiro, Madrid, 1803-1808 AD - Museo Nacional de Artes Decorativas - Madrid, Spain - DSC08407.JPG|thumb|''Prometheus modelling Man from clay'', by [[Esteban de Agreda]], [[biscuit porcelain]], 1803-1808.]]\nThe year 1803 marked a transition in the factory management from the Italian board of directors to the Spanish-born [[Bartolome Sureda y Miserol]].<ref name=\" Campbell, 2006\"/> During his career, Sureda directed several royal factories, including the [[Real Fabrica de Pa\u00f1os]] in [[Guadalajara]], the [[Royal Factory of La Moncloa|Real Fabrica de Loza de la Moncloa]], and the [[Real F\u00e1brica de Cristales de La Granja]].<ref name=\"BrownMann1991\">{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Jonathan|last2=Mann|first2=Richard G.|title=Spanish Paintings of the Fifteenth through Nineteenth Centuries|url=https://archive.org/details/spanishpaintings0000nati|url-access=registration|accessdate=16 September 2012|date=29 March 1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-521-40107-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/spanishpaintings0000nati/page/14 14]\u2013}}</ref>\n\nThe occupying French forces were driven out of Madrid in 1812, during the [[Peninsular War]], and the park became the scene of intense fighting.

It was located in Madrid's [[Parque del Buen Retiro, Madrid]] on a site near the ''[[Fuente del \u00c1ngel Ca\u00eddo]]''.\n\nThe factory began by moving the [[Capodimonte porcelain]] factory from [[Naples]] in 1760, after its founder there had inherited the Spanish throne as [[Carlos III of Spain]]. He took the equipment and about 40 key workers, including [[Giuseppe Gricci]] (c. 1700\u20131770), the main modeller, and nearly five tons of porcelain paste.  Since the paste, the main artists, and the fleur-de-lys factory mark, were all used by both factories, distinguishing between their products from the years around the move can be very difficult.  The factory continued to make [[Soft-paste porcelain|soft paste porcelain]] until 1803, when it switched to [[hard-paste porcelain]]; some pieces made were in fact [[creamware]], an English style of fine [[earthenware]].<ref>Battie, 104\u2013105; Le Corbellier, 29</ref> \n[[File:12 Aranjuez (41).JPG|thumb|Porcelain room in the [[Palace of Aranjuez]], by [[Giuseppe Gricci|Gricci]], 1763-1765]]\n\nThe factory concentrated on figurines, especially of classical subjects, but also made tablewares and decorative vessels such as vases and pots.  Porcelain rooms were installed at three royal palaces. Initially Gricci's style remained similar to the elegant [[Rococo]] of his Naples works, but soon the newly-fashionable [[Neoclassicism]] became dominant, which remained the case throughout the life of the factory.\n\nAfter the disruptions of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], in 1817 the factory moved a short distance across Madrid to become the [[Royal Factory of La Moncloa]], again taking such moulds and equipment as survived, and the employees.  This operated until 1849.\n\n==Porcelain rooms==\n[[File:Palace-266629.jpg|thumb|Porcelain room in the [[Palacio Real, Madrid]], designed by Carlo Schepers in the 1770s]]\nGricci had made a [[chinoiserie]] porcelain room, the [[Porcelain boudoir of Maria Amalia of Saxony]], at the [[Palace of Portici]] near Naples (now moved to the [[Palace of Capodimonte]]), and was soon asked to make another one at the [[Palace of Aranjuez]], which he made and installed between 1763 and 1765, at a cost of 571,555 Spanish reales.<ref>Battie, 104</ref>  The factory made another room, rather smaller and in a [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] style, for the main [[Palacio Real, Madrid]]. This was designed by Carlo Schepers in the 1770s, and cost 256,958 reales.<ref>Battie, 104</ref>  Both these had walls largely of plain white plaques, over which lay a network of coloured elements in a medium to high [[relief]], made up of plant motifs and figures.  \n\nThe room at the small [[Casita del Pr\u00edncipe (El Escorial)|Casita del Principe, El Escorial]] was again Neoclassical, but with a very different appearance. The walls were almost entirely covered by 234 plaques in the style and technique of [[Wedgwood]]'s [[jasperware]], with a \"Wedgwood blue\" ground and the design in white [[biscuit porcelain]] in low [[relief]]. These were applied as [[Sprigging (pottery)|sprigs]], meaning that they made separately as thin pieces, and stuck to the main blue body before firing.  The plaques are framed like paintings; they were made between 1790 and 1795.<ref>[https://cvc.cervantes.es/actcult/patrimonio/ceramica/buen_retiro/casita_principe/ \"Sala de Porcelana de la Casita del Pr\u00edncipe de El Escorial\"], in Spanish, [https://cvc.cervantes.es/actcult/patrimonio/ceramica/buen_retiro/casita_principe/indice.htm with pages of images here]</ref>\n\n==History==\n===1700s===\nThe factory was founded in 1760 on a site in the Buen Retiro park which at that time was the private gardens of a royal palace on the outskirts of Madrid.<ref name=\" Campbell, 2006\">{{cite book|last= Campbell |first= Gordon  |title= The Volume 2 of The Grove Encyclopedia of Decorative Arts |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=R8BMW6Au7pQC&pg=PA256&lpg=PA256&dq=Real+Fabrica+del+Buen+Retiro&source=bl&ots=jh2t5vhepG&sig=TjpZFG0-rXkElAtN6b58F8E64pU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=RlZTUNyjAunriQK4toGQDw&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Real%20Fabrica%20del%20Buen%20Retiro&f=false|year=2006|publisher= Oxford University Press |isbn= 9780195189483|page =118}}</ref> It was an initiative of [[Carlos III of Spain]], who succeeded to the Spanish throne in 1759, and his wife, [[Maria Amalia of Saxony]].\n[[File:Estanque-grande.jpg|thumb|The factory in the [[Buen Retiro Park]], centre, beyond the lake]] \nPrior to becoming King of Spain, Charles reigned as King of Naples and Sicily.  A similar factory, the [[Capodimonte porcelain|Porcellana di Capodimonte]], had been established by the royal couple in Naples.  Maria Amalia died in 1760, a year after moving to Madrid with her husband, but she was an important influence on both the Naples and the Madrid factories.<ref>She was a member of the Wettin [[Electors of Saxony]] who had established the [[Meissen porcelain|porcelain factory at Meissen]].</ref>  53 specialized [[Italian people|Italian]] craftsmen from [[Naples]] came to Madrid, along with three shipments containing the necessary equipment and special paste, to establish a factory to produce royal porcelain in Madrid. Gaetano Schepers was in charge of the factory and ten Spanish artists were also associated with the manufacturing. The porcelain's quality was internationally recognized, and its manufacturing techniques were kept a state secret.  Buen Retiro porcelain was one of the products that drove [[Mercantilism|mercantilist]] royal policy during the Spanish [[Age of Enlightenment]].  There were other factories in the Madrid area producing luxuries such as tapestries, glass etc.\n\n===1800s===\n[[File:Myth of Prometheus, Esteban Agreda, Real Fabrica del Buen Retiro, Madrid, 1803-1808 AD - Museo Nacional de Artes Decorativas - Madrid, Spain - DSC08407.JPG|thumb|''Prometheus modelling Man from clay'', by [[Esteban de Agreda]], [[biscuit porcelain]], 1803-1808.]]\nThe year 1803 marked a transition in the factory management from the Italian board of directors to the Spanish-born [[Bartolome Sureda y Miserol]].<ref name=\" Campbell, 2006\"/> During his career, Sureda directed several royal factories, including the [[Real Fabrica de Pa\u00f1os]] in [[Guadalajara]], the [[Royal Factory of La Moncloa|Real Fabrica de Loza de la Moncloa]], and the [[Real F\u00e1brica de Cristales de La Granja]].<ref name=\"BrownMann1991\">{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Jonathan|last2=Mann|first2=Richard G.|title=Spanish Paintings of the Fifteenth through Nineteenth Centuries|url=https://archive.org/details/spanishpaintings0000nati|url-access=registration|accessdate=16 September 2012|date=29 March 1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-521-40107-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/spanishpaintings0000nati/page/14 14]\u2013}}</ref>\n\nThe occupying French forces were driven out of Madrid in 1812, during the [[Peninsular War]], and the park became the scene of intense fighting.
