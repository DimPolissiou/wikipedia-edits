The pace is even and there is not a single dull moment throughout. Below are the list of episodes with summary:\n\n=== Episode 1: The solution ===\nNakul (Gulshan Devaiah) is a struggling writer based in Mumbai who is having a hard time coping with unemployment, lovelessness and personal guilt. This leads him on a suicidal path as he tries creative ways of ending his life. On one occasion he lies down in front of an incoming train, but is saved by a senile beggar who ends up dead instead. Nakul then jumps in a lake, but is saved by onlookers. His psychiatrist Shloka (Anjali Patil) argues that deep down he doesn't want to die, as his survival instinct always kicks in and saves him from his misadventures.\n\nIn the Harsil town of Uttarakhand a local cop, Bir Singh (Aakash Dahiya) is investigating the murder of 11 monks in a Hindu monastery. The 12th monk and the prime suspect is missing.\n\nMeanwhile Nakul approaches an agency \"Emergency Exit\" which specialises in assisted suicide and orders a hit on himself. The agent Maria Gomes(Ratnabali Bhattacharjee) assures him that his death is certain as the job will be handled by Updadhyay (Heeba Shah). Updadhyay is a ruthless killer who is very committed to her assignment. She maintains a kill count of her victims by slashing her arms with a blade.\n\nLater in the day Nakul receives call from a publishing house expressing interest in his work. It seems luck is beginning to turn in Nakul's favour.\n\n=== Episode 2: The calm ===\nNakul had accidentally given the wrong address of his apartments because of which Updadhyay kills a person in the neighbouring block. As Nakul relishes his last living day, he settles all debts with local shopkeepers and meets up with Shloka at a tea stall.\n\nTwo days earlier, the head monk of Harshil monastery had handed over the Elixir of life ([[Amrita|Amrut]]) to the 12th monk, Fokatiya. The Elixir would grant immortality if it is served by an immortal, otherwise it would act as poison. Fokatiya had to find the \"immortal man\" in Mumbai. The monks are not the only ones in the quest for immortality. A scientist based out of London, Dr.Goldfish (Jamie Alter) is actively conducting research on the subject.\n\nShloka tells Nakul that her husband had committed suicide hence does not want the same fate for him. She also admits her feelings for Nakul. This is motivation enough for him, as he now has someone who cares for him and hence a purpose in life. As they speak on, Nakul is shot in the head by Updadhyay. Fokatiya happens to be around the tea stall and along with Shloka they rush him to hospital.\n\n=== Episode 3: The afterlife ===\nNakul has luckily survived the head shot, however the bullet is now permanently stuck on his forehead. On hearing that he had survived several suicide attempts earlier, Fokatiya is convinced that Nakul is the immortal man he is looking for. Updadhyay is dining with Maria and her daughter when a patron verbally abuses Maria's daughter for a trivial mishap. Despite Maria's insistence Updadhyay retaliates by plucking out his eyeball out with a fork.\n\nAn investigative journalist Ayesha Mirani (Sulagna Panigrahi) had authored an article about the existence of Amrut within the Harshil monastery following which the monks were killed. Her editor is critical of this and warns her not to pursue this further. She hears about the suicide agency \"emergency exit\" and decides to do a story on them instead. Meanwhile Bir Singh travels to Mumbai where the 12th monk, Fokatiya was seen.\n\nNakul approaches the suicide agency to cancel the hit he has ordered on himself, however Maria tells him its impossible as Updadhyay doesn't let any assignment incomplete. As they speak, Updadhyay arrives on the spot and tries to kill Nakul however the trio escape with the help of a Russian tourist who happened to be around.\n\n=== Episode 4: The stranger ===\nAfter escaping from Updadhyay, the trio along with the Russian tourist Jim (Danish Sait) arrive at Shloka's house. Fokatiya explains the legend of Elixir and tell Nakul he is the immortal man. Later in the day Fokatiya explains Nakul that the Amrut was produced by [[Samudra manthan|Samudra Manthan]], the mythological churning of sea and since then has been preserved by the monks' order. The [[East India Company|British East India company]] was looking for the same, but with the help of [[Duleep Singh|Maharaja of Lahore]] they tricked the British into thinking the [[Koh-i-Noor|Kohinoor]] diamond was the Elixir. However they realised the trickery after the death of Queen Victoria.\n\nMeanwhile Bir Singh goes around sticking wanted posters of Fokatiya branding him as murder suspect. While at a local police station, Shloka notices the wanted poster and immediately calls Nakul to warn him of this. Nakul immediately dashes out of the apartments when Updadhyay catches his scent. She chases him to a construction site where he manages to slip with the help of Jim. However Shloka who was at the construction site to help Nakul gets taken as hostage.\n\nAs Jim is driving Nakul to safety, it is revealed that he is the hired assassin who had killed the monks at Harshil monastery in his quest for the Elixir.\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Gulshan Devaiah]] as Nakul\n*[[Sulagna Panigrahi]] as Ayesha Mirani\n*[[Anjali Patil]] as Shloka\n*Heeba Shah as Karima Upadhyay\n*[[Aakash Dahiya]] as Inspector Bir Singh\n*Ratnabali Bhattacharjee as Maria Gomes\n*Jamie Alter as Dr Goldfish\n*[[Danish Sait]] as Jim\n\n== Reception ==\nAfsos met with positive critical acclaim,many critics consider it as most different web series than others which are releasing on ott platform,critics appraised it's comedy,timing and dark humour and roles of Heeba Shah & Gulshan Deviah who still the show.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{IMDb title|tt10174244}}\n* [https://www.amazon.com/Afsos-Season-1/dp/B083P48SH8 Afsos] on [[Prime Video]]\n\n[[Category:Amazon Video original programming]]\n[[Category:2020 Indian television series debuts]]\n[[Category:Hindi-language television programs]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|2020 Indian black comedy series}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2020}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=March 2020}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = Afsos\n| image                    = \n| image_alt                = \n| caption                  = \n| creator                  = Anirban Dasgupta & Dibya Chaterjee\n| based_on                 = \n| starring                 = {{ubl|[[Gulshan Devaiah]]|[[Sulagna Panigrahi]]|[[Anjali Patil]]|[[Heeba Shah]]|[[Aakash Dahiya]]|[[Ratnabali Bhattacharjee]]}}\n| composer                 = Neel Adhikari\n| country                  = India\n| language                 = {{ubl|Hindi|English}}\n| num_seasons              = 1\n| num_episodes             = 8\n| list_episodes            = \n| executive_producer       = \n| camera                   = [[Single-camera setup|Single-camera]]\n| runtime                  = \n| company                  = OML Entertainment PVT LTD\n| distributor              = \n| network                  = [[Amazon Video]]\n| first_run                = \n| released                 = 7th Feb\n| first_aired              = {{Start date|df=yes|2020|2|6}}\n| last_aired               = \n| writer                   = Dibya Chatterjee<br />Anirban Dasgupta<br />Sourav Ghosh\n}}\n\n'''''Afsos''''' ({{trans|Regret}}) is an Indian [[black comedy]] web series directed by Anubhuti Kashyap.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.indiatoday.in/binge-watch/story/gulshan-devaiah-on-afsos-it-s-about-life-s-positives-not-depression-1645635-2020-02-12 |title=Gulshan Devaiah on Afsos: It's about life's positives, not depression |date=12 February 2020 |work=India Today |access-date=2 March 2020}}</ref> Starring [[Gulshan Devaiah]], [[Sulagna Panigrahi]], [[Anjali Patil]] and Heeba Shah, the series follows a depressed man who wants to commit suicide but is unable to die.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Khan |first=Shakir |url=https://www.republicworld.com/entertainment-news/television-news/gulshan-devaiahs-witty-reply-on-afsos-being-released-and-taken-down.html |title=Gulshan Devaiah's Witty Reply On 'Afsos' Being Released And Taken Down From Amazon Prime |date=23 January 2020 |work=Republic World |access-date=2 March 2020}}</ref> It premiered on [[Amazon Video]] on 6 February, 2020.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://scroll.in/reel/951807/heres-what-gulshan-devaiah-is-doing-about-being-underrated-and-underutilised |title=Here\u2019s what Gulshan Devaiah is doing about being \u2018underrated and underutilised\u2019 |date=6 February 2020 |work=Scroll.in |access-date=2 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/binge-watch/story/gulshan-devaiah-on-afsos-it-s-about-life-s-positives-not-depression-1645635-2020-02-12|title=Gulshan Devaiah on Afsos: It's about life's positives, not depression|last=|first=|last2=|first2=|date=|website=[[India Today]]|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-12|last3=]|first3=]}}</ref>\n\n== Episodes ==\nThe series is made up of 8 mini-episodes adding to a total runtime of 204 minutes.

[[Folate]] levels in the individual may affect the course of pathological changes and symptomatology of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.  \n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Definition==\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub>, also known as cobalamin, is a water-soluble vitamin essential to the function of all cells. \"Cobalamin\" actually refers to a group of compounds (corrinoids) with near-identical structure. Cobalamins are characterized by a [[porphyrin]]-like [[corrin]] nucleus that contains a single [[cobalt]] atom bound to a [[benzimidazole|benzimidazolyl]] [[nucleotide]] and a variable residue (R) group. Because these chemical compounds have a similar molecular structure, each of which shows vitamin activity in a vitamin-deficient biological system, they are referred to as [[vitamer]]s. The vitamin activity is as a [[coenzyme]], meaning that its presence is required for enzyme-catalyzed reactions.<ref name=DRItext/><ref name=Banerjee2003 /> For [[cyanocobalamin]], the R-residue is [[cyanide]]. For [[hydroxocobalamin]] it is a hydroxyl group. Both of these can be converted to either of the two cobalamin coenzymes that are active in human metabolism: [[adenosylcobalamin]] (AdoB<sub>12</sub>) and [[methylcobalamin]] (MeB<sub>12</sub>). AdoB<sub>12</sub> has a 5\u2032-deoxyadenosyl group linked to the cobalt atom at the core of the molecule; MeB<sub>12</sub> has a methyl group at that location. These enzymatically active enzyme cofactors function, respectively, in [[mitochondria]] and cell [[cytosol]].<ref name=DRItext/>\n\nCyanocobalamin is a manufactured form with a cyano (cyanide) group bound to cobalt. Bacterial fermentation creates AdoB<sub>12</sub> and MeB<sub>12</sub> which are converted to cyanocobalamin by addition of potassium cyanide in the presence of sodium nitrite and heat. Once consumed, cyanocobalamin is converted to the biologically active AdoB<sub>12</sub> and MeB<sub>12</sub>. Cyanocobalamin is the most common form used in dietary supplements and [[food fortification]] because cyanide stabilizes the molecule from degradation. However, methylcobalamin is also offered as a dietary supplement. [[Hydroxocobalamin]] has a hydroxyl group attached to the cobalt atom. It can be injected intramuscularly to treat Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. Injected intravenously, it is used to treat cyanide poisoning, as the hydroxyl group is displaced by cyanide, creating a non-toxic cyanocobalamin that is excreted in urine. \"Pseudovitamin B<sub>12</sub>\" refers to compounds that are [[corrinoid]]s with structure similar to the vitamin but without vitamin activity.<ref name=Watanabe2018>{{cite journal |vauthors=Watanabe F, Bito T |title=Determination of Cobalamin and Related Compounds in Foods |journal=J AOAC Int |volume=101 |issue=5 |pages=1308\u20131313 |date=September 2018 |pmid=29669618 |doi=10.5740/jaoacint.18-0045 |url=}}</ref> Pseudovitamin B<sub>12</sub> is the majority corrinoid in [[Spirulina (dietary supplement)|spirulina]], an algal health food sometimes erroneously claimed as having this vitamin activity.<ref name=Watanabe1999>{{cite journal |vauthors=Watanabe F, Katsura H, Takenaka S, Fujita T, Abe K, Tamura Y, Nakatsuka T, Nakano Y |title=Pseudovitamin B(12) is the predominant cobamide of an algal health food, spirulina tablets |journal=J.

RDA for lactation equals 2.8 \u03bcg/day. For infants up to 12 months the adequate intake (AI) is 0.4\u20130.5{{nbsp}}\u03bcg/day. (AIs are established when there is insufficient information to determine EARs and RDAs.) For children ages 1\u201313 years the RDA increases with age from 0.9 to 1.8{{nbsp}}\u03bcg/day. Because 10 to 30 percent of older people may be unable to effectively absorb vitamin B{{sub|12}} naturally occurring in foods, it is advisable for those older than 50 years to meet their RDA mainly by consuming foods fortified with vitamin B{{sub|12}} or a supplement containing vitamin B{{sub|12}}. As for safety, [[tolerable upper intake level]]s (known as ULs) are set for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient.

All of the substrate cobalt-corrin molecules from which B<sub>12</sub> is made must be synthesized by bacteria. The human body has the ability to convert cyanocobalamin and hydroxocobalamin to an active form by means of enzymatically removing certain prosthetic chemical groups from the cobalt atom and replacing them with others.\n[[File:Cobalamin-general-structure-color.png|thumb|The structures of the four most common vitamers of cobalamin, together with some synonyms.

It is metabolized in the body to an active [[coenzyme]] form.<ref name=lpi/> Bacteria are used in commercial production process to synthesize hydroxocobalamin, adenosylcobalamin and methylcobalamin which are then converted to cyanocobalamin by exposure to cyanide (-CN).  \n*'''[[Hydroxocobalamin]]''' is another vitamer of B<sub>12</sub> commonly encountered in pharmacology. It is sometimes denoted B<sub>12a</sub>. Because it is water soluble it is used for intramuscular or intravenous injection. Hydroxocobalamin is used as an antidote to cyanide poisoning. The cyanide is bound by conversion of hydroxocobalamin to cyanocobalamin, which is then safely excreted in urine. There is some evidence that hydroxocobalamin is converted to the active enzymatic forms of B<sub>12</sub> more easily than cyanocobalamin, so although it is more expensive than cyanocobalamin, has been used for vitamin replacement in situations where added reassurance of activity is desired. Intramuscular administration of hydroxocobalamin is the preferred treatment for [[pediatric]] patients with intrinsic cobalamin [[metabolic diseases]], for vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficient patients with [[tobacco amblyopia]] (which is thought to perhaps have a component of cyanide poisoning from cyanide in cigarette smoke); and for treatment of patients with pernicious anemia who have optic neuropathy.\n*'''[[Adenosylcobalamin]]''' (adoB<sub>12</sub> or AdoCbl) is an enzymatically active cofactor form of B<sub>12</sub> that naturally occurs in the body.

The MUT function is necessary for proper [[myelin]] synthesis.\n# [[5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase|MTR]], also known as methionine synthase, is a methyltransferase enzyme, which uses the MeB<sub>12</sub> and reaction type 2 to transfer a methyl group from [[5-methyltetrahydrofolate]] to [[homocysteine]], thereby generating [[tetrahydrofolate]] (THF) and [[methionine]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Banerjee RV, Matthews RG | title = Cobalamin-dependent methionine synthase | journal = FASEB Journal | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = 1450\u20139 | date = March 1990 | pmid = 2407589 | doi = 10.1096/fasebj.4.5.2407589 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/72f397b529d457977a9e949dbfb325eebe124590 | hdl = 2027.42/154369 | hdl-access = free }}</ref> This functionality is lost in [[vitamin B12 deficiency|vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency]], resulting in an increased [[homocysteine]] level and the trapping of [[folate]] as 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate, from which THF (the active form of folate) cannot be recovered. THF plays an important role in DNA synthesis so reduced availability of THF results in ineffective production of cells with rapid turnover, in particular red blood cells, and also intestinal wall cells which are responsible for absorption. [[Tetrahydrofolate|THF]] may be regenerated via MTR or may be obtained from fresh folate in the diet. Thus all of the DNA synthetic effects of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, including the [[megaloblastic anemia]] of [[pernicious anemia]], resolve if sufficient dietary folate is present. Thus the best-known \"function\" of B<sub>12</sub> (that which is involved with DNA synthesis, cell-division, and anemia) is actually a facultative function which is mediated by B<sub>12</sub>-conservation of an active form of folate which is needed for efficient DNA production.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wickramasinghe SN | title = Morphology, biology and biochemistry of cobalamin- and folate-deficient bone marrow cells | journal = Bailli\u00e8re's Clinical Haematology | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 441\u201359 | date = September 1995 | pmid = 8534956 | doi = 10.1016/S0950-3536(05)80215-X }}</ref> Other cobalamin-requiring methyltransferase enzymes are also known in bacteria, such as Me-H<sub>4</sub>-MPT, coenzyme M methyltransferase.\n\n===Enzyme function===\nIf folate is present in quantity, then of the two absolutely vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-dependent enzyme-family reactions in humans, the [[Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase|MUT]]-family reactions show the most direct and characteristic secondary effects, focusing on the nervous system (see below). This is because the MTR (methyltransferase-type) reactions are involved in regenerating folate, and thus are less evident when folate is in good supply.\n\nSince the late 1990s, folic acid has begun to be added to fortify flour in many countries, so folate deficiency is now more rare. At the same time, since DNA synthetic-sensitive tests for [[anemia]] and [[erythrocyte]] size are routinely done in even simple medical test clinics (so that these folate-mediated biochemical effects are more often directly detected), the [[Methionine synthase|MTR]]-dependent effects of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency are becoming apparent not as anemia due to DNA-synthetic problems (as they were classically), but now mainly as a simple and less obvious elevation of homocysteine in the blood and urine ([[homocysteinuria]]). This condition may result in long-term damage to arteries and in clotting (stroke and heart attack), but this effect is difficult to separate from other common processes associated with atherosclerosis and aging.\n\nThe specific myelin damage resulting from B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, even in the presence of adequate folate and methionine, is more specifically and clearly a vitamin deficiency problem.<ref name=lpi/> It has been connected to B<sub>12</sub> most directly by reactions related to MUT, which is absolutely required to convert methylmalonyl coenzyme A into succinyl coenzyme A. Failure of this second reaction to occur results in elevated levels of MMA, a myelin destabilizer. Excessive MMA will prevent normal [[fatty acid synthesis]], or it will be incorporated into [[fatty acid]]s itself rather than normal [[malonic acid]]. If this abnormal fatty acid subsequently is incorporated into myelin, the resulting myelin will be too fragile, and demyelination will occur. Although the precise mechanism or mechanisms are not known with certainty, the result is [[subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Naidich MJ, Ho SU | title = Case 87: Subacute combined degeneration | journal = Radiology | volume = 237 | issue = 1 | pages = 101\u20135 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16183926 | doi = 10.1148/radiol.2371031757 }}</ref> Whatever the cause, it is known that B<sub>12</sub> deficiency causes [[neuropathies]], even if folic acid is present in good supply, and therefore anemia is not present.\n\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub>-dependent [[5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase|MTR]] reactions may also have neurological effects, through an indirect mechanism. Adequate [[methionine]] (which, like folate, must otherwise be obtained in the diet, if it is not regenerated from [[homocysteine]] by a B<sub>12</sub> dependent reaction) is needed to make [[S-Adenosyl methionine|''S''-adenosyl methionine]] (SAMe), which is in turn necessary for methylation of [[myelin]] sheath [[phospholipid]]s. Although production of SAMe is not B<sub>12</sub> dependent, help in recycling for provision of one adequate substrate for it (the [[essential amino acid]] methionine) is assisted by B<sub>12</sub>. In addition, SAMe is involved in the manufacture of certain [[neurotransmitter]]s, [[catecholamine]]s and in brain metabolism. These neurotransmitters are important for maintaining mood, possibly explaining why depression is associated with B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. Methylation of the myelin sheath phospholipids may also depend on adequate folate, which in turn is dependent on MTR recycling, unless ingested in relatively high amounts.\n\n==Physiology==\n===Absorption===\nFood B<sub>12</sub> is absorbed by two processes. The first is a vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-specific intestinal mechanism using [[intrinsic factor]] through which 1\u20132 micrograms can be absorbed every few hours. The second is a passive diffusion process.<ref name=DRItext/> The human physiology of active vitamin B<sub>12</sub> absorption from food is complex. Protein-bound vitamin B<sub>12</sub> must be released from the proteins by the action of digestive proteases in both the stomach and small intestine. [[Gastric acid]] releases the vitamin from food particles; therefore [[antacid]] and acid-blocking medications (especially [[proton-pump inhibitor]]s) may inhibit absorption of B<sub>12</sub>. After B<sub>12</sub> has been freed from proteins in food by [[pepsin]] in the stomach, [[R-protein]] (also known as haptocorrin and cobalophilin), a B<sub>12</sub> binding protein that is produced in the salivary glands, binds to B<sub>12</sub>. This protects the vitamin from degradation in the acidic environment of the stomach.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Allen RH, Seetharam B, Podell E, Alpers DH | title = Effect of proteolytic enzymes on the binding of cobalamin to R protein and intrinsic factor. In vitro evidence that a failure to partially degrade R protein is responsible for cobalamin malabsorption in pancreatic insufficiency | journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume = 61 | issue = 1 | pages = 47\u201354 | date = January 1978 | pmid = 22556 | pmc = 372512 | doi = 10.1172/JCI108924 }}</ref> This pattern of B<sub>12</sub> transfer to a special binding protein secreted in a previous digestive step, is repeated once more before absorption. The next binding protein for B<sub>12</sub> is [[intrinsic factor]] (IF), a protein synthesized by gastric [[parietal cell]]s that is secreted in response to [[histamine]], [[gastrin]] and [[pentagastrin]], as well as the presence of food. In the [[duodenum]], [[protease]]s digest R-proteins and release their bound B<sub>12</sub>, which then binds to IF, to form a complex (IF/B<sub>12</sub>). B<sub>12</sub> must be attached to IF for it to be efficiently absorbed, as receptors on the enterocytes in the terminal [[ileum]] of the [[small bowel]] only recognize the B<sub>12</sub>-IF complex; in addition, intrinsic factor protects the vitamin from [[catabolism]] by intestinal bacteria.<ref name=DRItext/>\n\nAbsorption of food vitamin B<sub>12</sub> thus requires an intact and functioning [[stomach]], [[exocrine pancreas]], intrinsic factor, and small bowel.<ref name=DRItext/> Problems with any one of these organs makes a vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency possible. Individuals who lack intrinsic factor have a decreased ability to absorb B<sub>12</sub>. In [[pernicious anemia]], there is a lack of IF due to autoimmune [[atrophic gastritis]], in which antibodies form against parietal cells. Antibodies may alternately form against and bind to IF, inhibiting it from carrying out its B<sub>12</sub> protective function. Due to the complexity of B<sub>12</sub> absorption, geriatric patients, many of whom are hypoacidic due to reduced parietal cell function, have an increased risk of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.<ref name=combs2008>{{cite book|first=Gerald F. |last=Combs | name-list-format = vanc |title=The vitamins: fundamental aspects in nutrition and health |edition=3rd |publisher=Elsevier Academic Press |location=Amsterdam |year=2008 |pages=381\u2013398 |isbn=978-0-12-183492-0|oclc=150255807}}</ref> This results in 80\u2013100% excretion of oral doses in the feces versus 30\u201360% excretion in feces as seen in individuals with adequate IF.<ref name=combs2008/>\n\nOnce the IF/B<sub>12</sub> complex is recognized by specialized [[cubilin|ileal receptors]], it is transported into the [[portal circulation]]. The vitamin is then transferred to [[transcobalamin II]] (TC-II/B<sub>12</sub>), which serves as the plasma transporter. Hereditary defects in production of the transcobalamins and their receptors may produce functional deficiencies in B<sub>12</sub> and infantile [[megaloblastic anemia]], and abnormal B<sub>12</sub> related biochemistry, even in some cases with normal blood B<sub>12</sub> levels. For the vitamin to serve inside cells, the TC-II/B<sub>12</sub> complex must bind to a cell receptor, and be [[endocytosis|endocytosed]]. The transcobalamin-II is degraded within a [[lysosome]], and free B<sub>12</sub> is finally released into the cytoplasm, where it may be transformed into the proper coenzyme, by certain cellular enzymes (see above).<ref name=DRItext/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Al-Awami HM, Raja A, Soos MP |title=Physiology, Intrinsic Factor (Gastric Intrinsic Factor) |journal=StatPearls [Internet] |volume= |issue= |pages= |date= August 2019 |pmid=31536261 |doi= |url=}}</ref>\n\nInvestigations into the intestinal absorption of B<sub>12</sub> point out that the upper limit of absorption per single oral dose, under normal conditions, is about 1.5{{nbsp}}\u00b5g. The passive diffusion process of B<sub>12</sub> absorption - a very small portion of total absorption of the vitamin from food consumption<ref name=DRItext/> - may exceed the R-protein and IF mediated absorption when oral doses of B<sub>12</sub> are very large (a thousand or more \u00b5g per dose) as commonly happens in dedicated-pill oral B<sub>12</sub> supplementation.

The total amount of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> stored in body is about 2\u20135{{nbsp}}mg in adults. Around 50% of this is stored in the liver. Approximately 0.1% of this is lost per day by secretions into the gut, as not all these secretions are reabsorbed. [[Bile]] is the main form of B<sub>12</sub> excretion; most of the B<sub>12</sub> secreted in the bile is recycled via [[enterohepatic circulation]]. Excess B<sub>12</sub> beyond the blood's binding capacity is typically excreted in urine. Owing to the extremely efficient enterohepatic circulation of B<sub>12</sub>, the liver can store 3 to 5 years' worth of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>; therefore, nutritional deficiency of this vitamin is rare in adults in the absence of malabsorption disorders.<ref name=DRItext/>\n\n==Production==\n===Biosynthesis===\n{{Main|Cobalamin biosynthesis}}\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub> is derived from a [[tetrapyrrole|tetrapyrrolic structural framework]] created by the enzymes [[Porphobilinogen deaminase|deaminase]] and [[uroporphyrinogen III synthase|cosynthetase]] which transform [[aminolevulinic acid]] via [[porphobilinogen]] and [[hydroxymethylbilane]] to [[uroporphyrinogen III]].

[[Folate]] levels in the individual may affect the course of pathological changes and symptomatology of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.  \n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Definition==\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub>, also known as cobalamin, is a water-soluble vitamin essential to the function of all cells. \"Cobalamin\" actually refers to a group of compounds (corrinoids) with near-identical structure. Cobalamins are characterized by a [[porphyrin]]-like [[corrin]] nucleus that contains a single [[cobalt]] atom bound to a [[benzimidazole|benzimidazolyl]] [[nucleotide]] and a variable residue (R) group. Because these chemical compounds have a similar molecular structure, each of which shows vitamin activity in a vitamin-deficient biological system, they are referred to as [[vitamer]]s. The vitamin activity is as a [[coenzyme]], meaning that its presence is required for enzyme-catalyzed reactions.<ref name=DRItext/><ref name=Banerjee2003 /> For [[cyanocobalamin]], the R-residue is [[cyanide]]. For [[hydroxocobalamin]] it is a hydroxyl group. Both of these can be converted to either of the two cobalamin coenzymes that are active in human metabolism: [[adenosylcobalamin]] (AdoB<sub>12</sub>) and [[methylcobalamin]] (MeB<sub>12</sub>). AdoB<sub>12</sub> has a 5\u2032-deoxyadenosyl group linked to the cobalt atom at the core of the molecule; MeB<sub>12</sub> has a methyl group at that location. These enzymatically active enzyme cofactors function, respectively, in [[mitochondria]] and cell [[cytosol]].<ref name=DRItext/>\n\nCyanocobalamin is a manufactured form with a cyano (cyanide) group bound to cobalt. Bacterial fermentation creates AdoB<sub>12</sub> and MeB<sub>12</sub> which are converted to cyanocobalamin by addition of potassium cyanide in the presence of sodium nitrite and heat. Once consumed, cyanocobalamin is converted to the biologically active AdoB<sub>12</sub> and MeB<sub>12</sub>. Cyanocobalamin is the most common form used in dietary supplements and [[food fortification]] because cyanide stabilizes the molecule from degradation. However, methylcobalamin is also offered as a dietary supplement. [[Hydroxocobalamin]] has a hydroxyl group attached to the cobalt atom. It can be injected intramuscularly to treat Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. Injected intravenously, it is used to treat cyanide poisoning, as the hydroxyl group is displaced by cyanide, creating a non-toxic cyanocobalamin that is excreted in urine. \"Pseudovitamin B<sub>12</sub>\" refers to compounds that are [[corrinoid]]s with structure similar to the vitamin but without vitamin activity.<ref name=Watanabe2018>{{cite journal |vauthors=Watanabe F, Bito T |title=Determination of Cobalamin and Related Compounds in Foods |journal=J AOAC Int |volume=101 |issue=5 |pages=1308\u20131313 |date=September 2018 |pmid=29669618 |doi=10.5740/jaoacint.18-0045 |url=}}</ref> Pseudovitamin B<sub>12</sub> is the majority corrinoid in [[Spirulina (dietary supplement)|spirulina]], an algal health food sometimes erroneously claimed as having this vitamin activity.<ref name=Watanabe1999>{{cite journal |vauthors=Watanabe F, Katsura H, Takenaka S, Fujita T, Abe K, Tamura Y, Nakatsuka T, Nakano Y |title=Pseudovitamin B(12) is the predominant cobamide of an algal health food, spirulina tablets |journal=J.

All of the substrate cobalt-corrin molecules from which B<sub>12</sub> is made must be synthesized by bacteria. The human body has the ability to convert cyanocobalamin and hydroxocobalamin to an active form by means of enzymatically removing certain prosthetic chemical groups from the cobalt atom and replacing them with others.\n[[File:Cobalamin-general-structure-color.png|thumb|The structures of the four most common vitamers of cobalamin, together with some synonyms.

It is metabolized in the body to an active [[coenzyme]] form.<ref name=lpi/> Bacteria are used in commercial production process to synthesize hydroxocobalamin, adenosylcobalamin and methylcobalamin which are then converted to cyanocobalamin by exposure to cyanide (-CN).  \n*'''[[Hydroxocobalamin]]''' is another vitamer of B<sub>12</sub> commonly encountered in pharmacology. It is sometimes denoted B<sub>12a</sub>. Because it is water soluble it is used for intramuscular or intravenous injection. Hydroxocobalamin is used as an antidote to cyanide poisoning. The cyanide is bound by conversion of hydroxocobalamin to cyanocobalamin, which is then safely excreted in urine. There is some evidence that hydroxocobalamin is converted to the active enzymatic forms of B<sub>12</sub> more easily than cyanocobalamin, so although it is more expensive than cyanocobalamin, has been used for vitamin replacement in situations where added reassurance of activity is desired. Intramuscular administration of hydroxocobalamin is the preferred treatment for [[pediatric]] patients with intrinsic cobalamin [[metabolic diseases]], for vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficient patients with [[tobacco amblyopia]] (which is thought to perhaps have a component of cyanide poisoning from cyanide in cigarette smoke); and for treatment of patients with pernicious anemia who have optic neuropathy.\n*'''[[Adenosylcobalamin]]''' (adoB<sub>12</sub> or AdoCbl) is an enzymatically active cofactor form of B<sub>12</sub> that naturally occurs in the body.

THF plays an important role in DNA synthesis so reduced availability of THF results in ineffective production of cells with rapid turnover, in particular red blood cells, and also intestinal wall cells which are responsible for absorption. [[Tetrahydrofolate|THF]] may be regenerated via MTR or may be obtained from fresh folate in the diet. Thus all of the DNA synthetic effects of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, including the [[megaloblastic anemia]] of [[pernicious anemia]], resolve if sufficient dietary folate is present. Thus the best-known \"function\" of B<sub>12</sub> (that which is involved with DNA synthesis, cell-division, and anemia) is actually a facultative function which is mediated by B<sub>12</sub>-conservation of an active form of folate which is needed for efficient DNA production.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wickramasinghe SN | title = Morphology, biology and biochemistry of cobalamin- and folate-deficient bone marrow cells | journal = Bailli\u00e8re's Clinical Haematology | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 441\u201359 | date = September 1995 | pmid = 8534956 | doi = 10.1016/S0950-3536(05)80215-X }}</ref> Other cobalamin-requiring methyltransferase enzymes are also known in bacteria, such as Me-H<sub>4</sub>-MPT, coenzyme M methyltransferase.\n\n===Enzyme function===\nIf folate is present in quantity, then of the two absolutely vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-dependent enzyme-family reactions in humans, the [[Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase|MUT]]-family reactions show the most direct and characteristic secondary effects, focusing on the nervous system (see below). This is because the MTR (methyltransferase-type) reactions are involved in regenerating folate, and thus are less evident when folate is in good supply.\n\nSince the late 1990s, folic acid has begun to be added to fortify flour in many countries, so folate deficiency is now more rare. At the same time, since DNA synthetic-sensitive tests for [[anemia]] and [[erythrocyte]] size are routinely done in even simple medical test clinics (so that these folate-mediated biochemical effects are more often directly detected), the [[Methionine synthase|MTR]]-dependent effects of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency are becoming apparent not as anemia due to DNA-synthetic problems (as they were classically), but now mainly as a simple and less obvious elevation of homocysteine in the blood and urine ([[homocysteinuria]]). This condition may result in long-term damage to arteries and in clotting (stroke and heart attack), but this effect is difficult to separate from other common processes associated with atherosclerosis and aging.\n\nThe specific myelin damage resulting from B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, even in the presence of adequate folate and methionine, is more specifically and clearly a vitamin deficiency problem.<ref name=lpi/> It has been connected to B<sub>12</sub> most directly by reactions related to MUT, which is absolutely required to convert methylmalonyl coenzyme A into succinyl coenzyme A. Failure of this second reaction to occur results in elevated levels of MMA, a myelin destabilizer. Excessive MMA will prevent normal [[fatty acid synthesis]], or it will be incorporated into [[fatty acid]]s itself rather than normal [[malonic acid]]. If this abnormal fatty acid subsequently is incorporated into myelin, the resulting myelin will be too fragile, and demyelination will occur. Although the precise mechanism or mechanisms are not known with certainty, the result is [[subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Naidich MJ, Ho SU | title = Case 87: Subacute combined degeneration | journal = Radiology | volume = 237 | issue = 1 | pages = 101\u20135 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16183926 | doi = 10.1148/radiol.2371031757 }}</ref> Whatever the cause, it is known that B<sub>12</sub> deficiency causes [[neuropathies]], even if folic acid is present in good supply, and therefore anemia is not present.\n\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub>-dependent [[5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase|MTR]] reactions may also have neurological effects, through an indirect mechanism. Adequate [[methionine]] (which, like folate, must otherwise be obtained in the diet, if it is not regenerated from [[homocysteine]] by a B<sub>12</sub> dependent reaction) is needed to make [[S-Adenosyl methionine|''S''-adenosyl methionine]] (SAMe), which is in turn necessary for methylation of [[myelin]] sheath [[phospholipid]]s. Although production of SAMe is not B<sub>12</sub> dependent, help in recycling for provision of one adequate substrate for it (the [[essential amino acid]] methionine) is assisted by B<sub>12</sub>. In addition, SAMe is involved in the manufacture of certain [[neurotransmitter]]s, [[catecholamine]]s and in brain metabolism. These neurotransmitters are important for maintaining mood, possibly explaining why depression is associated with B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. Methylation of the myelin sheath phospholipids may also depend on adequate folate, which in turn is dependent on MTR recycling, unless ingested in relatively high amounts.\n\n==Physiology==\n===Absorption===\nFood B<sub>12</sub> is absorbed by two processes. The first is a vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-specific intestinal mechanism using [[intrinsic factor]] through which 1\u20132 micrograms can be absorbed every few hours. The second is a passive diffusion process.<ref name=DRItext/> The human physiology of active vitamin B<sub>12</sub> absorption from food is complex. Protein-bound vitamin B<sub>12</sub> must be released from the proteins by the action of digestive proteases in both the stomach and small intestine. [[Gastric acid]] releases the vitamin from food particles; therefore [[antacid]] and acid-blocking medications (especially [[proton-pump inhibitor]]s) may inhibit absorption of B<sub>12</sub>. After B<sub>12</sub> has been freed from proteins in food by [[pepsin]] in the stomach, [[R-protein]] (also known as haptocorrin and cobalophilin), a B<sub>12</sub> binding protein that is produced in the salivary glands, binds to B<sub>12</sub>. This protects the vitamin from degradation in the acidic environment of the stomach.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Allen RH, Seetharam B, Podell E, Alpers DH | title = Effect of proteolytic enzymes on the binding of cobalamin to R protein and intrinsic factor.

The next binding protein for B<sub>12</sub> is [[intrinsic factor]] (IF), a protein synthesized by gastric [[parietal cell]]s that is secreted in response to [[histamine]], [[gastrin]] and [[pentagastrin]], as well as the presence of food. In the [[duodenum]], [[protease]]s digest R-proteins and release their bound B<sub>12</sub>, which then binds to IF, to form a complex (IF/B<sub>12</sub>). B<sub>12</sub> must be attached to IF for it to be efficiently absorbed, as receptors on the enterocytes in the terminal [[ileum]] of the [[small bowel]] only recognize the B<sub>12</sub>-IF complex; in addition, intrinsic factor protects the vitamin from [[catabolism]] by intestinal bacteria.<ref name=DRItext/>\n\nAbsorption of food vitamin B<sub>12</sub> thus requires an intact and functioning [[stomach]], [[exocrine pancreas]], intrinsic factor, and small bowel.<ref name=DRItext/> Problems with any one of these organs makes a vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency possible. Individuals who lack intrinsic factor have a decreased ability to absorb B<sub>12</sub>. In [[pernicious anemia]], there is a lack of IF due to autoimmune [[atrophic gastritis]], in which antibodies form against parietal cells. Antibodies may alternately form against and bind to IF, inhibiting it from carrying out its B<sub>12</sub> protective function. Due to the complexity of B<sub>12</sub> absorption, geriatric patients, many of whom are hypoacidic due to reduced parietal cell function, have an increased risk of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.<ref name=combs2008>{{cite book|first=Gerald F. |last=Combs | name-list-format = vanc |title=The vitamins: fundamental aspects in nutrition and health |edition=3rd |publisher=Elsevier Academic Press |location=Amsterdam |year=2008 |pages=381\u2013398 |isbn=978-0-12-183492-0|oclc=150255807}}</ref> This results in 80\u2013100% excretion of oral doses in the feces versus 30\u201360% excretion in feces as seen in individuals with adequate IF.<ref name=combs2008/>\n\nOnce the IF/B<sub>12</sub> complex is recognized by specialized [[cubilin|ileal receptors]], it is transported into the [[portal circulation]]. The vitamin is then transferred to [[transcobalamin II]] (TC-II/B<sub>12</sub>), which serves as the plasma transporter. Hereditary defects in production of the transcobalamins and their receptors may produce functional deficiencies in B<sub>12</sub> and infantile [[megaloblastic anemia]], and abnormal B<sub>12</sub> related biochemistry, even in some cases with normal blood B<sub>12</sub> levels. For the vitamin to serve inside cells, the TC-II/B<sub>12</sub> complex must bind to a cell receptor, and be [[endocytosis|endocytosed]]. The transcobalamin-II is degraded within a [[lysosome]], and free B<sub>12</sub> is finally released into the cytoplasm, where it may be transformed into the proper coenzyme, by certain cellular enzymes (see above).<ref name=DRItext/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Al-Awami HM, Raja A, Soos MP |title=Physiology, Intrinsic Factor (Gastric Intrinsic Factor) |journal=StatPearls [Internet] |volume= |issue= |pages= |date= August 2019 |pmid=31536261 |doi= |url=}}</ref>\n\nInvestigations into the intestinal absorption of B<sub>12</sub> point out that the upper limit of absorption per single oral dose, under normal conditions, is about 1.5{{nbsp}}\u00b5g.

Approximately 0.1% of this is lost per day by secretions into the gut, as not all these secretions are reabsorbed. [[Bile]] is the main form of B<sub>12</sub> excretion; most of the B<sub>12</sub> secreted in the bile is recycled via [[enterohepatic circulation]]. Excess B<sub>12</sub> beyond the blood's binding capacity is typically excreted in urine. Owing to the extremely efficient enterohepatic circulation of B<sub>12</sub>, the liver can store 3 to 5 years' worth of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>; therefore, nutritional deficiency of this vitamin is rare in adults in the absence of malabsorption disorders.<ref name=DRItext/>\n\n==Production==\n===Biosynthesis===\n{{Main|Cobalamin biosynthesis}}\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub> is derived from a [[tetrapyrrole|tetrapyrrolic structural framework]] created by the enzymes [[Porphobilinogen deaminase|deaminase]] and [[uroporphyrinogen III synthase|cosynthetase]] which transform [[aminolevulinic acid]] via [[porphobilinogen]] and [[hydroxymethylbilane]] to [[uroporphyrinogen III]].

The culture medium for LLD required liver extract. Shorb knew that the same liver extract was used to treat pernicious anemia (her father-in-law had died from the disease), and concluded that LLD could be developed as an assay method to identify the active compound. While at the University of Maryland she received a small grant from [[Merck & Co.|Merck]], and in collaboration with [[Karl Folkers]] from that company, developed the LLD assay. This identified \"LLD factor\" as essential for the bacteria's growth.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ansc.umd.edu/news/annual-events/shorb|title=Mary Shorb Lecture in Nutrition|access-date=March 3, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304085215/https://ansc.umd.edu/news/annual-events/shorb|archive-date=March 4, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Shorb, Folker and  [[Alexander R.

It is served by the [[R (New York City Subway service)|R]] train at all times.\n\nThe 86th Street station was constructed as part of the Fourth Avenue Line. Though it was originally planned to be a four-track express station with two [[island platform]]s, only the western platform and tracks were ultimately built. Construction on the segment of the line that includes 86th Street started in 1913, and was completed in 1915. The station opened on January 15, 1916 as part of an extension of the BMT Fourth Avenue Line from [[59th Street (BMT Fourth Avenue Line)|59th Street]] to 86th Street. The station's platforms were lengthened in 1925, and it was renovated in the 1970s and again in the late 2000s. An elevator is being installed at the 86th Street station between 2018 and 2020.\n\nThe 86th Street station serves as a bus hub and terminal for several [[New York City Transit]] bus routes.\n\n==History==\nOn January 24, 1913, construction began on Route 11B2, which includes this station and extends between 61st Street and 89th Street.

It is served by the [[R (New York City Subway service)|R]] train at all times.\n\nThe 86th Street station was constructed as part of the Fourth Avenue Line. Though it was originally planned to be a four-track express station with two [[island platform]]s, only the western platform and tracks were ultimately built. Construction on the segment of the line that includes 86th Street started in 1913, and was completed in 1915. The station opened on January 15, 1916 as part of an extension of the BMT Fourth Avenue Line from [[59th Street (BMT Fourth Avenue Line)|59th Street]] to 86th Street. The station's platforms were lengthened in 1925, and it was renovated in the 1970s and again in the late 2000s. An elevator is being installed at the 86th Street station between 2018 and 2020.\n\nThe 86th Street station serves as a bus hub and terminal for several [[New York City Transit]] bus routes.\n\n==History==\nOn January 24, 1913, construction began on Route 11B2, which includes this station and extends between 61st Street and 89th Street.

Classically trained on piano as a child, she began composing her own songs when she was eight years old. Her debut album, ''[[Tidal (album)|Tidal]]'', containing songs written when Apple was 17, was released in 1996 and received a Grammy Award for Best Female Vocal Rock Performance for the single \"[[Criminal (Fiona Apple song)|Criminal]]\". She followed with ''[[When the Pawn...]]'' (1999), produced by [[Jon Brion]], which was also critically and commercially successful and was certified platinum.\n\nFor her third album, ''[[Extraordinary Machine]]'' (2005), Apple again collaborated with Brion, and began recording the album in 2002. However, Apple was reportedly unhappy with the production and opted not to release the record, leading fans to protest [[Epic Records]], erroneously believing that the label was withholding its release. The album was eventually re-produced without Brion and released in October 2005. The album was certified [[Gold album|gold]], and nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album]]. In 2012, she released her fourth studio album, ''[[The Idler Wheel...]]'', which received critical praise and was followed by a tour of the United States and was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album]] in 2013.

Classically trained on piano as a child, she began composing her own songs when she was eight years old. Her debut album, ''[[Tidal (album)|Tidal]]'', containing songs written when Apple was 17, was released in 1996 and received a Grammy Award for Best Female Vocal Rock Performance for the single \"[[Criminal (Fiona Apple song)|Criminal]]\". She followed with ''[[When the Pawn...]]'' (1999), produced by [[Jon Brion]], which was also critically and commercially successful and was certified platinum.\n\nFor her third album, ''[[Extraordinary Machine]]'' (2005), Apple again collaborated with Brion, and began recording the album in 2002. However, Apple was reportedly unhappy with the production and opted not to release the record, leading fans to protest [[Epic Records]], erroneously believing that the label was withholding its release. The album was eventually re-produced without Brion and released in October 2005. The album was certified [[Gold album|gold]], and nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album]]. In 2012, she released her fourth studio album, ''[[The Idler Wheel...]]'', which received critical praise and was followed by a tour of the United States and was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album]] in 2013.
