Frankland has continued to contribute articles to [[academic journals]] beyond his official retirement and his 100th birthday.<ref name=Lane/>\n\n===Hygiene hypothesis===\n\nFrankland believed that the rise in allergies results from increased cleanliness and the levels of hygiene in modern life \u2014 the so-called [[hygiene hypothesis]]. He has said that \"We don't set off our immune system early on, we are too clean. In the former East Germany for instance, with very poor work and housing conditions, people were less allergic.\"<ref name=\"anaphlaxis campaign\"/>\n\n===Pollen count===\n\nFrankland was keen to provide patients he saw in London with information about pollens, such as the levels of pollen on any given day, and the times of year when levels would tend to be at their highest. St. Mary's Hospital employed a botanist to assist with collecting this information, and to complement the work on pollen counts already being measured in [[Cardiff]]. Weekly London pollen counts were sent to members of the British Allergy Society from 1953 and shared publicly, via ''[[The Times]]'' and ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', from 1963.<ref name=Hekint>{{cite web| url= https://hekint.org/2019/05/20/grandfather-of-allergy-dr-bill-frankland-the-ardent-centenarian/| title= Grandfather of allergy: Dr. Bill Frankland, the ardent centenarian| last=Turner| first=John| publisher=Hektoen International| date=Spring 2019| accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Self-experimentation===\n\nHe was also a supporter of the idea of [[Desensitization (medicine)|desensitisation]], a technique which aims to reduce the level of immune response to allergens by repeated low doses of the substance to which the patient has an allergy. In 1955, Frankland experimented on himself by being bitten each day by the blood-sucking insect ''[[Rhodnius prolixus]]''. He was assisted in this work by the [[London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine]], which was able to supply insects which Frankland could be sure he had never previously been exposed to. The bites eventually provoked a severe [[anaphylaxis|anaphylactic reaction]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bsaci.org/LiteratureRetrieve.aspx?ID=134068&A=SearchResult&SearchID=1670263&\n|accessdate=16 April 2015|title= Dr A W (Bill) Frankland|publisher=British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immuniology}}</ref>\n\nThis research contributed to an understanding of how long injections of allergens would need to be given to achieve desensitisation. Results varied by individual, but immunity to pollen was found on average after three years. Immunity to venom-based allergens took longer, and was found on average after five years.<ref name=\"anaphlaxis campaign\"/>\n\n===Collaboration with Alexander Fleming===\n\nDuring the 1950s, Frankland served as an assistant to [[Alexander Fleming]] in the development of penicillin. The two had a daily meeting, but due to Fleming's lack of interest in clinical medicine, Frankland has said that he cannot recall a patient ever being discussed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imperial.nhs.uk/about-us/blog/grandfather-of-allergy-dr-william-frankland-pollen-count-alexander-fleming-70-years-nhs |title=Grandfather of allergy, Dr William Frankland, aged 106, on popularising the pollen count, working with Alexander Fleming and spending 70 years in the NHS |publisher=[[Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust]] |date=5 July 2018 |access-date=2 April 2020}}</ref> Frankland and Fleming were also concerned with [[antimicrobial resistance]] to penicillin, with Frankland crediting Fleming with saying that careless prescription would inadvertently lead to \"the death of man.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://healthwnews.com/health-news/discoverer-of-penicillin-foresaw-the-threat-of-antibiotic-resistance/ |title=Discoverer of penicillin foresaw the threat of antibiotic resistance |date=3 December 2018 |access-date=2 April 2020 |website=HealthWNews.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 1954, Frankland published \"Prophylaxis of summer Hay-fever and Asthma.\" The article reported the results of a trial involving 200 patients with previous histories of grass pollen sensitivity half treated with active vaccines, and half with inactive 'control' vaccines.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Frankland|first1=A.

Contacted to visit a VIP in Baghdad having trouble with asthma, Frankland advised Hussein this was not the case and to give up his habit of 40 cigarettes a day. Frankland has said \"To my lasting regret, I told him that was his trouble and that if he carried on, in another two years he wouldn\u2019t be head of state.

He worked at Guy's on this basis for another twenty years on peanut [[anaphylaxis]] and [[Pediatrics|paediatric]] allergies. After retiring from Guy's he continued to participate in academic life by attending conferences and publishing articles in journals.<ref name=Lane/>\n\nIn February 2012, Frankland appeared as an expert witness in a British court. The accused had claimed that a vehicle crash in which he was involved was caused by his losing control following a [[bee sting]]. Although Frankland agreed with the defence that such a scenario was possible, he gave an opinion that delayed-response reactions to bee stings only occurred after there had been initial symptoms following the sting. In this case there had not been such symptoms, and the accused was found guilty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/worlds-oldest-expert-witness-william-frankland/story-fnb64oi6-1226283231827|title=World's oldest expert witness William Frankland|work=The Australian|date=28 February 2012|accessdate=13 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, he appeared in an episode of the [[BBC 2]] TV series ''Britain's Greatest Generation'' and as a guest on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[Desert Island Discs]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Butcher|first=David|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/episode/dmdnpp/britains-greatest-generation--series-1---3-the-fight-for-freedom|title=Britain's Greatest Generation: Series 1 \u2013 3.

Frankland has continued to contribute articles to [[academic journals]] beyond his official retirement and his 100th birthday.<ref name=Lane/>\n\n===Hygiene hypothesis===\n\nFrankland believed that the rise in allergies results from increased cleanliness and the levels of hygiene in modern life \u2014 the so-called [[hygiene hypothesis]]. He has said that \"We don't set off our immune system early on, we are too clean. In the former East Germany for instance, with very poor work and housing conditions, people were less allergic.\"<ref name=\"anaphlaxis campaign\"/>\n\n===Pollen count===\n\nFrankland was keen to provide patients he saw in London with information about pollens, such as the levels of pollen on any given day, and the times of year when levels would tend to be at their highest. St. Mary's Hospital employed a botanist to assist with collecting this information, and to complement the work on pollen counts already being measured in [[Cardiff]]. Weekly London pollen counts were sent to members of the British Allergy Society from 1953 and shared publicly, via ''[[The Times]]'' and ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', from 1963.<ref name=Hekint>{{cite web| url= https://hekint.org/2019/05/20/grandfather-of-allergy-dr-bill-frankland-the-ardent-centenarian/| title= Grandfather of allergy: Dr. Bill Frankland, the ardent centenarian| last=Turner| first=John| publisher=Hektoen International| date=Spring 2019| accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Self-experimentation===\n\nHe was also a supporter of the idea of [[Desensitization (medicine)|desensitisation]], a technique which aims to reduce the level of immune response to allergens by repeated low doses of the substance to which the patient has an allergy. In 1955, Frankland experimented on himself by being bitten each day by the blood-sucking insect ''[[Rhodnius prolixus]]''. He was assisted in this work by the [[London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine]], which was able to supply insects which Frankland could be sure he had never previously been exposed to. The bites eventually provoked a severe [[anaphylaxis|anaphylactic reaction]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bsaci.org/LiteratureRetrieve.aspx?ID=134068&A=SearchResult&SearchID=1670263&\n|accessdate=16 April 2015|title= Dr A W (Bill) Frankland|publisher=British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immuniology}}</ref>\n\nThis research contributed to an understanding of how long injections of allergens would need to be given to achieve desensitisation. Results varied by individual, but immunity to pollen was found on average after three years. Immunity to venom-based allergens took longer, and was found on average after five years.<ref name=\"anaphlaxis campaign\"/>\n\n===Collaboration with Alexander Fleming===\n\nDuring the 1950s, Frankland served as an assistant to [[Alexander Fleming]] in the development of penicillin. The two had a daily meeting, but due to Fleming's lack of interest in clinical medicine, Frankland has said that he cannot recall a patient ever being discussed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imperial.nhs.uk/about-us/blog/grandfather-of-allergy-dr-william-frankland-pollen-count-alexander-fleming-70-years-nhs |title=Grandfather of allergy, Dr William Frankland, aged 106, on popularising the pollen count, working with Alexander Fleming and spending 70 years in the NHS |publisher=[[Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust]] |date=5 July 2018 |access-date=2 April 2020}}</ref> Frankland and Fleming were also concerned with [[antimicrobial resistance]] to penicillin, with Frankland crediting Fleming with saying that careless prescription would inadvertently lead to \"the death of man.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://healthwnews.com/health-news/discoverer-of-penicillin-foresaw-the-threat-of-antibiotic-resistance/ |title=Discoverer of penicillin foresaw the threat of antibiotic resistance |date=3 December 2018 |access-date=2 April 2020 |website=HealthWNews.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 1954, Frankland published \"Prophylaxis of summer Hay-fever and Asthma.\" The article reported the results of a trial involving 200 patients with previous histories of grass pollen sensitivity half treated with active vaccines, and half with inactive 'control' vaccines.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Frankland|first1=A.

Frankland has said \"To my lasting regret, I told him that was his trouble and that if he carried on, in another two years he wouldn\u2019t be head of state.

After retiring from Guy's he continued to participate in academic life by attending conferences and publishing articles in journals.<ref name=Lane/>\n\nIn February 2012, Frankland appeared as an expert witness in a British court. The accused had claimed that a vehicle crash in which he was involved was caused by his losing control following a [[bee sting]]. Although Frankland agreed with the defence that such a scenario was possible, he gave an opinion that delayed-response reactions to bee stings only occurred after there had been initial symptoms following the sting. In this case there had not been such symptoms, and the accused was found guilty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/worlds-oldest-expert-witness-william-frankland/story-fnb64oi6-1226283231827|title=World's oldest expert witness William Frankland|work=The Australian|date=28 February 2012|accessdate=13 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, he appeared in an episode of the [[BBC 2]] TV series ''Britain's Greatest Generation'' and as a guest on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[Desert Island Discs]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Butcher|first=David|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/episode/dmdnpp/britains-greatest-generation--series-1---3-the-fight-for-freedom|title=Britain's Greatest Generation: Series 1 \u2013 3.

Since the inaugural derby in 1985, the event has seen several rule changes, evolving from a short outs-based competition, to multiple rounds, and eventually a bracket-style timed event.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:2008 Major League Baseball Home Run Derby.jpg|400px|thumb|2008 Major League Baseball Home Run Derby]]\nThere was previously a weekly televised event in the 1960s called the Home Run Derby. This was the inspiration for the iteration that was conceived later. The televised event had baseball legends Hank Aaron, Mickey Mantle, and Willie Mayes.

Prior to 1991, the Home Run Derby was structured as a two-[[inning]] event with each player receiving five [[out (baseball)|out]]s per inning, allowing for the possibility of ties. It is now one of the most-watched events broadcast on [[ESPN]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Baseball; ESPN rift with MLB a real derby; Dispute heats up over credentials|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/bostonherald/access/42976018.html?dids=42976018:42976018&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jul+07%2C+1999&author=Jim+Baker&pub=Boston+Herald&desc=Baseball%3B+ESPN+rift+with+MLB+a+real+derby%3B+Dispute+heats+up+over+credentials&pqatl=google|work=[[Boston Herald]]|date=Jul 7, 1999|accessdate=July 16, 2013|author=Baker, Jim}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/entertainment/2008057270_apcablenielsens.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130717084555/http://seattletimes.com/html/entertainment/2008057270_apcablenielsens.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 17, 2013 |title=Home Run Derby on ESPN is No. 1 on cable TV |agency=[[Associated Press]] |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=July 23, 2008 |accessdate=July 16, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/columnist/hiestand-tv/2009-07-07-espn-home-run-derby-graphics_N.htm|title=ESPN adds new graphics for Home Run Derby coverage|work=[[USA Today]]|date=July 7, 2009|accessdate=July 16, 2013|author=Hiestand, Michael|quote=Monday's Home Run Derby\u2014 often cable TV's highest-rated summer event}}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, a \"[[match play]]\"-style format was instituted for the second round. The player with the most home runs in the first round faced the player with the least among the four qualifying players, as did the players with the second- and third-most totals. The contestant who won each matchup advanced to the finals. This format was discontinued after the 2003 competition.\n\nThe field of players selected currently consists of four [[American League]] players and four [[National League]] players. The first Derby in 1985 featured five from each league, and the 1986 and 1987 events featured three and two players from each league, respectively. In 1996, the field was again expanded to ten players, with five from each league (though in 1997, the AL had six contestants to the NL's four).\n\nIn 2000, the field reverted to the current four-player-per-league format. The only exception was 2005, when [[Major League Baseball]] changed the selection criteria so that eight players represented their home countries instead of their respective leagues. The change was believed to be in promotion of the inaugural [[World Baseball Classic]], played in March [[2006 in baseball|2006]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} In 2006, the selection of four players from each league resumed. In 2011, the format was revised so that team captains selected the individual sides.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nSome notable performances in the Derby include [[Bobby Abreu]] in 2005, who won the Derby with a then-record 41 homers, including a then-record 24 in the first round. The first-round record was broken in 2019 by [[Vladimir Guerrero Jr.]], who hit 29 home runs. He broke that record in the following round, hitting 40 home runs in 2 tiebreakers. The previous overall record was set in 2016 by [[Giancarlo Stanton]], who finished with a total of 61 home runs, defeating [[Todd Frazier]] in the final round. The current overall record is held by [[Vladimir Guerrero Jr.]] at a mark of 91, set in 2019. Only two participants, [[Yoenis C\u00e9spedes]] and [[Giancarlo Stanton]], have won the Home Run Derby without being selected to the All-Star Game.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cespedes beats Harper to claim Derby title|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130715&content_id=53864458&vkey=news_mlb&c_id=mlb|publisher=MLB.com|last=Castrovince|first=Anthony|date=July 16, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n\n===Format===\n8 players duel in a home run challenge.\n\n==== 1985\u20131990 ====\nIn the early years of the Home Run Derby, 4-10 players from both the AL and NL were selected to participate. Each player was given 2 \"innings\" to hit as many home runs as possible before reaching 5 outs. For the derby, an out is defined as any swing that is not a home run. The winner of the contest was the player with the most total home runs in the two innings.\n\n==== 1991\u20132005 ====\nBeginning in 1991, the format changed to a 3-round contest. From 1991\u20132006, 8-10 players were selected and hit as many home runs as possible before reaching 10 outs in each round. The tally reset for each round, with the top four advancing to the second round, and the top two advancing to the final.\n\nIn honor of the [[World Baseball Classic]], the 2005 contest featured eight players from different countries. The format remained the same.\n\n==== 2006\u20132013 ====\nThe format changed slightly in 2006. Instead of the tally resetting for each round, it was only reset before the final round. Therefore, the players with the four highest totals after Round 1 advanced to Round 2, and the players with the two highest sum of Round 1 and 2 advanced to the finals.\n\n==== 2014 ====\nThe Home Run Derby format was changed significantly in 2014, as MLB sought to speed-up the contest and increase the drama. In the new bracket format, five players from each league faced the other players in their league in Round 1, with each players having seven \"outs.\" The player in each league with the highest Round 1 total received a second-round bye, and the players with the second- and third-highest Round 1 totals from each league faced off. The Round 2 winner from each league faced the Round 1 winner, and the Round 3 winner crowned the league winner. The final featured the winner of each league. Each round stands alone, with the score reset for each round.<ref>[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article//home-run-derby-to-feature-bracketed-play-as-part-of-new-format?content_id=81241076&partnerId=as_mlb_20140623_26563166&ymd=20140623 Derby to feature bracketed play as part of new format]</ref> Ties in any round are broken by a 3-swing swing-off. If the players remain tied, the players engage in a sudden-death swing-off until one player homers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2107593-mlb-announces-changes-to-2014-home-run-derby-format-and-rules|title=HR Derby Gets New Format, Rules|last=Keeney|first=Tim|access-date=2016-07-12}}</ref>\n\n==== 2015\u2013Present ====\nThe format was changed once again in 2015. The most significant change was the elimination of \"outs\", which was replaced by a time limit. Eight players are seeded based on their season home run totals and are given five minutes to hit as many home runs as possible. The winner of each head-to-head matchup advances, until a final winner is determined. If a tie occurs in any match-up, two sets of tiebreakers are employed: first, a 1-minute swing-off decides the winner; thereafter, multiple swingoffs of 3 swings until a winner is determined. Further, a player can get \"bonus time\" in the last minute of each round. During that time, the clock would stop for each home run, and would not restart until a swing does not result in a home run. Additional bonus time could be earned for distance. Players who hit at least two home runs measuring at least {{convert|420|ft|m|1}} are given an extra minute of bonus time. An additional 30 seconds of bonus time is granted if at least one home run measures over {{convert|475|ft|m|1}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.mlb.com/news/article/133381146/home-run-derby-to-introduce-new-format|title=Home Run Derby to introduce new format|work=Major League Baseball}}</ref>\n\nWeather concerns in 2015 lead to a reduction in time from five minutes per round to four minutes. The clock was not stopped in the final minute, and one minute of bonus time was granted only for hitting two home runs of at least {{convert|425|ft|m|1}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.si.com/mlb/2015/07/06/2015-mlb-home-run-derby-rules-start-time|title=Home Run Derby Five-Minute Guide: Everything you need to know|last=Corcoran|first=Cliff|website=www.si.com|access-date=2016-07-12}}</ref>\n\nThe four-minute round length was made permanent in 2016, while the minute of bonus time was reduced to 30 seconds and required two home runs of at least {{convert|440|ft|m|1}}. The additional time was removed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2651055-home-run-derby-2016-participants-breakdown-of-new-rules-for-all-star-showcase|title=Home Run Derby 2016: Participants, Breakdown of New Rules for All-Star Showcase|last=Silverman|first=Steve|access-date=2016-07-12}}</ref> Each batter is allowed one time-out during each round, and two in the finals.\n\nFor 2017 and 2018, the first tie-breaker was increased from a 1-minute swing off to {{fraction|1|1|2}} minutes. However, it was not needed either of these years. The swing off reverted to one minute in 2019, the first year in which it was used.\n\n===Gold balls===\nFrom 2005\u20132013, a gold ball has been used once a player reaches nine outs (in 2014 when the T-Mobile Ball came into play, six; since 2015, during the final minute). If a batter hit a home run using the golden ball, Century 21 Real Estate and [[Major League Baseball]] would donate $21,000 (a reference to the \"21\" in \"Century 21\") per home run to charity (MLB donated to the [[Boys and Girls Clubs of America]], and Century 21 donated to [[Easterseals (U.S.)|Easter Seals]]). In both 2005 and 2006, $294,000 was raised for the charities, equaling fourteen golden ball home runs per year. State Farm continued this in 2007 as they designated $17,000 per home run (one dollar for each of State Farm's agencies), to the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. In the [[2007 State Farm Home Run Derby|2007 event]], fifteen golden balls were hit for a donation of $255,000, and ten ($170,000) were hit in the [[2008 State Farm Home Run Derby|2008 event]]. For [[2009 Home Run Derby|2009]], State Farm added $5,000 for all non-Gold Ball homers, and $517,000 was collected. For [[2010 Home Run Derby|2010]], the non-Gold Ball homer was reduced to $3,000 per home run and a total of $453,000 was collected. Since [[2014 Major League Baseball Home Run Derby|2014]] any homer hit off a T-Mobile Ball resulted in a $10,000 donation to charity by T-Mobile and MLB, to [[Team Rubicon]].\n\n==Television and radio coverage==\nOn July 11, 1988, the day before the [[1988 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|Major League Baseball All-Star Game]] from [[Cincinnati]], [[Major League Baseball on TBS|TBS]] televised the annual All-Star Gala<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/mlb/story/2015-07-13/mlb-all-star-game-2015-cincinnati-1988-gala-zoo-home-run-derby-rain-baseball-video-weird-tbs-mark-mcgwire-snake-marge-schott-elephant-larry-king-a|title=The last time Cincinnati hosted the MLB All-Star Game, things got weird|work=The Sporting News}}</ref> from the [[Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden|Cincinnati Zoo]]. [[Larry King]] hosted the broadcast with [[Craig Sager]] and [[Pete Van Wieren]] handling interviews. The broadcast's big draw would have been the Home Run Derby, which TBS intended on taping during the afternoon, and later airing it in [[prime time]] during the Gala coverage. Unfortunately, the derby and a skills competition were canceled due to rain.\n\nThe derby was first nationally televised by [[ESPN]] in 1993 on a same-day delayed basis,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/419243-home-run-derby-2010-most-memorable-derby-moments#/articles/419243-home-run-derby-2010-most-memorable-derby-moments/page/4 |title=Home Run Derby 2010: Most Memorable Derby Moments |publisher=Bleacher Report |date=2010-07-12 |accessdate=2013-07-13}}</ref> with the first live telecast in 1998. Although two hours are scheduled in programming listings for the telecast, it has rarely ever been contained to the timeslot and consistently runs three to four hours. [[Chris Berman]] has gained notoriety for his annual hosting duties on ESPN, including his catchphrase, \"Back back back\u2026Gone!\". Berman starts this phrase when the ball is hit, and does not say \"Gone!\" until the ball lands.\n\nThe 2008 Derby was the year's most highly rated basic cable program.<ref>[http://www.multichannel.com/article/133975-ESPN_s_Home_Run_Derby_Delivers_Cable_s_Top_2008_Telecast.php Multichannel.com]</ref>\n\nBecause of the game's TV popularity, invited players have felt pressure to participate. Notably, [[Ken Griffey Jr.]] initially quietly declined to take part in 1998, partly due to ESPN scheduling the Mariners in their late Sunday game the night before. After a discussion with ESPN's [[Joe Morgan]] and another with Hall of Famer [[Frank Robinson]], Griffey changed his mind, and then won the Derby at Coors Field.<ref>[http://www.seattlepi.com/archives/1998/9807080028.asp Seattle Post-Intelligencer]</ref>\n\nIn Spanish, the event is televised on Spanish language network [[ESPN Deportes]].<ref>{{cite web|author=MLB.com|title=2015 Gillette Home Run Derby Presented By Head & Shoulders Exclusively on ESPN|url=http://espnmediazone.com/us/press-releases/2015/07/2015-gillette-home-run-derby-presented-by-head-shoulders-exclusively-on-espn/|publisher=ESPNMediazone.com|date=July 7, 2015|accessdate=July 13, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[ESPN Radio]] also carries the event annually.<ref>{{cite web|author=MLB.com|title=Home Run Derby press conference|url=http://m.mlb.com/news/article/21738578/|publisher=MLB Advanced Media, LP|date=July 11, 2011|accessdate=July 13, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Most watched Home Run Derbys===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

Since the inaugural derby in 1985, the event has seen several rule changes, evolving from a short outs-based competition, to multiple rounds, and eventually a bracket-style timed event.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:2008 Major League Baseball Home Run Derby.jpg|400px|thumb|2008 Major League Baseball Home Run Derby]]\nThe event has grown significantly from its roots in the 1980s, when it was not televised. Prior to 1991, the Home Run Derby was structured as a two-[[inning]] event with each player receiving five [[out (baseball)|out]]s per inning, allowing for the possibility of ties. It is now one of the most-watched events broadcast on [[ESPN]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Baseball; ESPN rift with MLB a real derby; Dispute heats up over credentials|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/bostonherald/access/42976018.html?dids=42976018:42976018&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jul+07%2C+1999&author=Jim+Baker&pub=Boston+Herald&desc=Baseball%3B+ESPN+rift+with+MLB+a+real+derby%3B+Dispute+heats+up+over+credentials&pqatl=google|work=[[Boston Herald]]|date=Jul 7, 1999|accessdate=July 16, 2013|author=Baker, Jim}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/entertainment/2008057270_apcablenielsens.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130717084555/http://seattletimes.com/html/entertainment/2008057270_apcablenielsens.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 17, 2013 |title=Home Run Derby on ESPN is No. 1 on cable TV |agency=[[Associated Press]] |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=July 23, 2008 |accessdate=July 16, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/columnist/hiestand-tv/2009-07-07-espn-home-run-derby-graphics_N.htm|title=ESPN adds new graphics for Home Run Derby coverage|work=[[USA Today]]|date=July 7, 2009|accessdate=July 16, 2013|author=Hiestand, Michael|quote=Monday's Home Run Derby\u2014 often cable TV's highest-rated summer event}}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, a \"[[match play]]\"-style format was instituted for the second round. The player with the most home runs in the first round faced the player with the least among the four qualifying players, as did the players with the second- and third-most totals. The contestant who won each matchup advanced to the finals. This format was discontinued after the 2003 competition.\n\nThe field of players selected currently consists of four [[American League]] players and four [[National League]] players. The first Derby in 1985 featured five from each league, and the 1986 and 1987 events featured three and two players from each league, respectively. In 1996, the field was again expanded to ten players, with five from each league (though in 1997, the AL had six contestants to the NL's four).\n\nIn 2000, the field reverted to the current four-player-per-league format. The only exception was 2005, when [[Major League Baseball]] changed the selection criteria so that eight players represented their home countries instead of their respective leagues. The change was believed to be in promotion of the inaugural [[World Baseball Classic]], played in March [[2006 in baseball|2006]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} In 2006, the selection of four players from each league resumed. In 2011, the format was revised so that team captains selected the individual sides.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nSome notable performances in the Derby include [[Bobby Abreu]] in 2005, who won the Derby with a then-record 41 homers, including a then-record 24 in the first round. The first-round record was broken in 2019 by [[Vladimir Guerrero Jr.]], who hit 29 home runs. He broke that record in the following round, hitting 40 home runs in 2 tiebreakers. The previous overall record was set in 2016 by [[Giancarlo Stanton]], who finished with a total of 61 home runs, defeating [[Todd Frazier]] in the final round. The current overall record is held by [[Vladimir Guerrero Jr.]] at a mark of 91, set in 2019. Only two participants, [[Yoenis C\u00e9spedes]] and [[Giancarlo Stanton]], have won the Home Run Derby without being selected to the All-Star Game.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cespedes beats Harper to claim Derby title|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130715&content_id=53864458&vkey=news_mlb&c_id=mlb|publisher=MLB.com|last=Castrovince|first=Anthony|date=July 16, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n\n===Format===\n8 players duel in a home run challenge.\n\n==== 1985\u20131990 ====\nIn the early years of the Home Run Derby, 4-10 players from both the AL and NL were selected to participate. Each player was given 2 \"innings\" to hit as many home runs as possible before reaching 5 outs. For the derby, an out is defined as any swing that is not a home run. The winner of the contest was the player with the most total home runs in the two innings.\n\n==== 1991\u20132005 ====\nBeginning in 1991, the format changed to a 3-round contest. From 1991\u20132006, 8-10 players were selected and hit as many home runs as possible before reaching 10 outs in each round. The tally reset for each round, with the top four advancing to the second round, and the top two advancing to the final.\n\nIn honor of the [[World Baseball Classic]], the 2005 contest featured eight players from different countries. The format remained the same.\n\n==== 2006\u20132013 ====\nThe format changed slightly in 2006. Instead of the tally resetting for each round, it was only reset before the final round. Therefore, the players with the four highest totals after Round 1 advanced to Round 2, and the players with the two highest sum of Round 1 and 2 advanced to the finals.\n\n==== 2014 ====\nThe Home Run Derby format was changed significantly in 2014, as MLB sought to speed-up the contest and increase the drama. In the new bracket format, five players from each league faced the other players in their league in Round 1, with each players having seven \"outs.\" The player in each league with the highest Round 1 total received a second-round bye, and the players with the second- and third-highest Round 1 totals from each league faced off. The Round 2 winner from each league faced the Round 1 winner, and the Round 3 winner crowned the league winner. The final featured the winner of each league. Each round stands alone, with the score reset for each round.<ref>[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article//home-run-derby-to-feature-bracketed-play-as-part-of-new-format?content_id=81241076&partnerId=as_mlb_20140623_26563166&ymd=20140623 Derby to feature bracketed play as part of new format]</ref> Ties in any round are broken by a 3-swing swing-off.

The most significant change was the elimination of \"outs\", which was replaced by a time limit. Eight players are seeded based on their season home run totals and are given five minutes to hit as many home runs as possible. The winner of each head-to-head matchup advances, until a final winner is determined. If a tie occurs in any match-up, two sets of tiebreakers are employed: first, a 1-minute swing-off decides the winner; thereafter, multiple swingoffs of 3 swings until a winner is determined. Further, a player can get \"bonus time\" in the last minute of each round. During that time, the clock would stop for each home run, and would not restart until a swing does not result in a home run. Additional bonus time could be earned for distance. Players who hit at least two home runs measuring at least {{convert|420|ft|m|1}} are given an extra minute of bonus time. An additional 30 seconds of bonus time is granted if at least one home run measures over {{convert|475|ft|m|1}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.mlb.com/news/article/133381146/home-run-derby-to-introduce-new-format|title=Home Run Derby to introduce new format|work=Major League Baseball}}</ref>\n\nWeather concerns in 2015 lead to a reduction in time from five minutes per round to four minutes. The clock was not stopped in the final minute, and one minute of bonus time was granted only for hitting two home runs of at least {{convert|425|ft|m|1}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.si.com/mlb/2015/07/06/2015-mlb-home-run-derby-rules-start-time|title=Home Run Derby Five-Minute Guide: Everything you need to know|last=Corcoran|first=Cliff|website=www.si.com|access-date=2016-07-12}}</ref>\n\nThe four-minute round length was made permanent in 2016, while the minute of bonus time was reduced to 30 seconds and required two home runs of at least {{convert|440|ft|m|1}}.

However, it was not needed either of these years. The swing off reverted to one minute in 2019, the first year in which it was used.\n\n===Gold balls===\nFrom 2005\u20132013, a gold ball has been used once a player reaches nine outs (in 2014 when the T-Mobile Ball came into play, six; since 2015, during the final minute). If a batter hit a home run using the golden ball, Century 21 Real Estate and [[Major League Baseball]] would donate $21,000 (a reference to the \"21\" in \"Century 21\") per home run to charity (MLB donated to the [[Boys and Girls Clubs of America]], and Century 21 donated to [[Easterseals (U.S.)|Easter Seals]]). In both 2005 and 2006, $294,000 was raised for the charities, equaling fourteen golden ball home runs per year. State Farm continued this in 2007 as they designated $17,000 per home run (one dollar for each of State Farm's agencies), to the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. In the [[2007 State Farm Home Run Derby|2007 event]], fifteen golden balls were hit for a donation of $255,000, and ten ($170,000) were hit in the [[2008 State Farm Home Run Derby|2008 event]]. For [[2009 Home Run Derby|2009]], State Farm added $5,000 for all non-Gold Ball homers, and $517,000 was collected. For [[2010 Home Run Derby|2010]], the non-Gold Ball homer was reduced to $3,000 per home run and a total of $453,000 was collected. Since [[2014 Major League Baseball Home Run Derby|2014]] any homer hit off a T-Mobile Ball resulted in a $10,000 donation to charity by T-Mobile and MLB, to [[Team Rubicon]].\n\n==Television and radio coverage==\nOn July 11, 1988, the day before the [[1988 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|Major League Baseball All-Star Game]] from [[Cincinnati]], [[Major League Baseball on TBS|TBS]] televised the annual All-Star Gala<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/mlb/story/2015-07-13/mlb-all-star-game-2015-cincinnati-1988-gala-zoo-home-run-derby-rain-baseball-video-weird-tbs-mark-mcgwire-snake-marge-schott-elephant-larry-king-a|title=The last time Cincinnati hosted the MLB All-Star Game, things got weird|work=The Sporting News}}</ref> from the [[Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden|Cincinnati Zoo]]. [[Larry King]] hosted the broadcast with [[Craig Sager]] and [[Pete Van Wieren]] handling interviews. The broadcast's big draw would have been the Home Run Derby, which TBS intended on taping during the afternoon, and later airing it in [[prime time]] during the Gala coverage. Unfortunately, the derby and a skills competition were canceled due to rain.\n\nThe derby was first nationally televised by [[ESPN]] in 1993 on a same-day delayed basis,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/419243-home-run-derby-2010-most-memorable-derby-moments#/articles/419243-home-run-derby-2010-most-memorable-derby-moments/page/4 |title=Home Run Derby 2010: Most Memorable Derby Moments |publisher=Bleacher Report |date=2010-07-12 |accessdate=2013-07-13}}</ref> with the first live telecast in 1998. Although two hours are scheduled in programming listings for the telecast, it has rarely ever been contained to the timeslot and consistently runs three to four hours. [[Chris Berman]] has gained notoriety for his annual hosting duties on ESPN, including his catchphrase, \"Back back back\u2026Gone!\". Berman starts this phrase when the ball is hit, and does not say \"Gone!\" until the ball lands.\n\nThe 2008 Derby was the year's most highly rated basic cable program.<ref>[http://www.multichannel.com/article/133975-ESPN_s_Home_Run_Derby_Delivers_Cable_s_Top_2008_Telecast.php Multichannel.com]</ref>\n\nBecause of the game's TV popularity, invited players have felt pressure to participate. Notably, [[Ken Griffey Jr.]] initially quietly declined to take part in 1998, partly due to ESPN scheduling the Mariners in their late Sunday game the night before. After a discussion with ESPN's [[Joe Morgan]] and another with Hall of Famer [[Frank Robinson]], Griffey changed his mind, and then won the Derby at Coors Field.<ref>[http://www.seattlepi.com/archives/1998/9807080028.asp Seattle Post-Intelligencer]</ref>\n\nIn Spanish, the event is televised on Spanish language network [[ESPN Deportes]].<ref>{{cite web|author=MLB.com|title=2015 Gillette Home Run Derby Presented By Head & Shoulders Exclusively on ESPN|url=http://espnmediazone.com/us/press-releases/2015/07/2015-gillette-home-run-derby-presented-by-head-shoulders-exclusively-on-espn/|publisher=ESPNMediazone.com|date=July 7, 2015|accessdate=July 13, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[ESPN Radio]] also carries the event annually.<ref>{{cite web|author=MLB.com|title=Home Run Derby press conference|url=http://m.mlb.com/news/article/21738578/|publisher=MLB Advanced Media, LP|date=July 11, 2011|accessdate=July 13, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Most watched Home Run Derbys===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

Gray]], 1869</small>\n}}\n\nThe '''yellow-faced honeyeater''' (''Caligavis chrysops'') is a small to medium-sized bird in the [[honeyeater]] [[family (biology)|family]], Meliphagidae. It takes its common and scientific names from the distinctive yellow stripes on the sides of its head. Its loud, clear call often begins twenty or thirty minutes before dawn. It is widespread across eastern and southeastern Australia, in open [[sclerophyll]] forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude [[subalpine area]]s, and [[woodland]]s along creeks and rivers. Comparatively short-billed for a honeyeater, it is thought to have adapted to a diet of flies, spiders, and beetles, as well as nectar and pollen from the flowers of plants, such as ''[[Banksia]]'' and ''[[Grevillea]]'', and soft fruits. It catches insects in flight as well as [[Gleaning (birds)|gleaning]] them from the foliage of trees and shrubs.\n\nSome yellow-faced honeyeaters are sedentary, but hundreds of thousands [[bird migration|migrate]] northwards between March and May to spend the winter in southern [[Queensland]], and return in July and August to breed in southern [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. They form [[Monogamy in animals|socially monogamous]] pairs and lay two or three eggs in a delicate [[cup nest|cup-shaped nest]]. The success rate can be low, and the pairs nest several times during the breeding season.\n\nHoneyeaters' preferred woodland habitat is vulnerable to the effects of land-clearing, grazing, and weeds. As it is common and widespread, the yellow-faced honeyeater is considered by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) to be of [[least concern]] for conservation. It is considered a pest in orchards in some areas.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe yellow-faced honeyeater was first [[species description|described]], and placed in the genus ''[[Typical warbler|Sylvia]]'', by ornithologist, [[John Latham (ornithologist)|John Latham]], in his 1801 work, ''Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici, sive Systematis Ornithologiae''.<ref name=latham01>{{cite book | last=Latham | first=John | author-link=John Latham (ornithologist) | year=1801 | title=Supplementum indicis ornithologici sive systematis ornithologiae | place=London | publisher=Leigh & Sotheby | language=Latin | page=liv | url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/33261428 }}</ref><ref name=Latham>{{cite journal | last = Schodde| first = Richard | authorlink = Richard Schodde |author2=Dickinson, Edward C. |author3=Steinheimer, Frank D. |author4=Bock, Walter J.  | title = The date of Latham's ''Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici'': 1801 or 1802? | journal = South Australian Ornithologist | volume = 35| issue = 8 | pages = 231\u2013235 | year = 2010| url=http://www.birdssa.asn.au/images/saopdfs/Volume35/2010V35P231.pdf }}</ref> French ornithologist, [[Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot]], described it as ''Melithreptus gilvicapillus'' in 1817, and English zoologist, [[George Robert Gray]], as ''Ptilotis trivirgata'' in 1869.<ref name=\"AFD\">{{cite web|url=https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/f27e5973-dc69-40d0-af23-ae1c49d6e0b3|title=Subspecies ''Caligavis chrysops chrysops'' (Latham, 1801)|author=Australian Biological Resources Study|date=13 October 2014|work=Australian Faunal Directory|publisher=Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts, Australian Government|accessdate=7 January 2017|location=Canberra, Australian Capital Territory}}</ref> The specific name ''chrysops'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] words ''chrysos'' meaning 'gold' and ''prosopo'' meaning 'face', in reference to the stripe of yellow feathers.<ref name=fraser13>{{cite book|last1=Gray|first1=Jeannie|last2=Fraser|first2=Ian|title=Australian Bird Names: A Complete Guide|url=https://books.google.com/?id=W1TCqHVWQp0C&pg=PT199#v=onepage&q=Yellow-faced%20honeyeater%20&f=false|year=2013|publisher=Csiro Publishing|location=Collingwood, Victoria | isbn=978-0-643-10471-6|page=199}}</ref>\n\nThe yellow-faced honeyeater was classified in the genera ''[[Meliphaga]]'' and then ''[[Lichenostomus]]'' until 2011.<ref name=\"AFD\"/> Delineating the latter genus had been systematically contentious, and evaluations of relationships among honeyeaters in the genus, using dense [[taxon]] and [[nucleotide]] sampling, confirmed previous findings that ''Lichenostomus'' is not [[Monophyly|monophyletic]].<ref name =Gardener>{{cite journal| last = Gardner | first = J.L.  | last2 = Trueman |first2=J.W.H. |last3=Ebert|first3=D. |last4=Joseph |first4=L. |last5=Magrath|first5=R.D. | title = Phylogeny and evolution of the ''Meliphagoidea'', the largest radiation of Australian songbirds  | journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution | volume = 55 | issue =  3| pages = 1087\u20131102 | year = 2010 | issn = 1055-7903  | doi = 10.1016/j.ympev.2010.02.005\n| pmid = 20152917}}</ref> Five species have previously been described as comprising the ''Caligavis'' subgroup, but studies, using the [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial]] DNA, identified the yellow-faced honeyeater as most closely related to the [[black-throated honeyeater]] (''C. subfrenatus'') and the [[obscure honeyeater]] (''C. obscurus'') of New Guinea; they were, therefore, grouped into the genus ''[[Caligavis]]''.

Above the yellow stripe is a black eye stripe which is broken by a small yellow to off-white patch behind the eye, and below is another distinct black stripe running the length of the yellow line. The chin, throat and breast are a pale greyish brown, streaked with slightly darker grey, and the abdomen is light grey. The upper body is a dark greyish brown to olive-brown. Olive-green outer edges on the [[Flight feather|remiges]] combine to form an olive panel on the folded wing. The bill is black and slightly down-curved, and the gape is cream. The legs and feet are grey-brown. The [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] is a dusky blue in adult birds, and brown in juveniles. The juvenile is very similar to the adult, with slightly less streaking on the breast, an orange-brown tip on the bill and a yellower gape; male and female birds are also similar, with the male being slightly larger (on average, {{convert|0.8|g|oz|abbr=on}} heavier); and in the field there are no visible differences between the subspecies. The yellow-faced honeyeater averages {{convert|15|-|17.5|cm|in}} in length, with a wingspan of {{convert|21.5|-|26|cm|in|abbr=on}} and a weight of {{convert|12.5|-|20.5|g|oz}}, with an average of {{convert|17|g|oz|abbr=on}}).{{sfn|Higgins|Christidis|Ford|2008|p=597}}{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=724}}\n\n===Vocalizations===\nOne of the first birds heard in the morning, the yellow-faced honeyeater utters calls that are full and loud, and extremely varied. The male sings from a roost for up to an hour, beginning twenty or thirty minutes before dawn.{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=724}} The song is a running series of cheerful notes sounding like ''chick-up, chick-up'', from which its common name of quitchup is derived.{{sfn|Officer|1965|p=50}} Counter-singing (repeating the first bird's song) by neighbouring birds is common. The territorial call, also given by opponents during fights, is a long ''preet'' with an upward inflection. The alarm call is a loud trilling whistle. Common calls, thought to be [[contact call]]s, are animated two-note calls variously described as ''terric, terric'', ''cr-rook, cr-rook'' or ''put-put, put-put''.{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=724}}\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n[[File:Yellow-faced Honeyeater callistemon.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Honeyeater balancing on a bottlebrush flower|The yellow-faced honeyeater can be seen feeding on garden shrubs.]]\n\n===Habitat===\nAcross its range, the yellow-faced honeyeater is found in a range of habitats\u2014in open [[sclerophyll]] forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude subalpine areas, and often in [[Riparian zone|riparian]] woodlands. It most commonly dwells in open forests dominated by spotted gum (''[[Corymbia maculata]]'') with [[ironbark]]s and [[stringybark]]s such as narrow-leaved ironbark (''[[Eucalyptus crebra]]'') and silver-leaved ironbark ([[Eucalyptus melanophloia|''E. melanophloia'']]), with a light shrubby [[understorey]], and less often in dry open forests and [[woodland]]s dominated by ''[[Angophora]]'', ''[[Acacia]]'', ''[[Banksia]]'', ''[[Casuarina]]'' or ''[[Callitris]]'', or in high-altitude, tall, open forests of alpine ash (''[[Eucalyptus delegatensis]]'') and woodlands dominated by snow gum (''[[Eucalyptus pauciflora|E. pauciflora]]'') or white box (''[[Eucalyptus albens|E. albens]]''). It has been recorded in coastal [[heath]] when banksias are blooming, and among flowering [[mangrove]]s. It occupies areas infested with weeds such as Scotch broom (''[[Cytisus scoparius]]'') and [[Blackberry|blackberries]], and developed areas including orchards and parks and gardens, where it feeds on cultivated fruit and flowers. It can be found in forests regenerating after [[Bushfires in Australia|fire]] or [[logging]], though it is more common in mature forests.{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=725}} Where it is found in woodland, it is usually woodland near forest or with an [[understory]] of sclerophyll plants.<ref name=\"Ford and Paton 76\">{{cite journal|last1=Ford|first1=Hugh A.|last2=Paton|first2=David C.|title=Resource partitioning and competition in honeyeaters of the genus ''Meliphaga''|journal=Australian Journal of Ecology|date=1976|volume=1|issue=4|pages=281\u2013287|doi=10.1111/j.1442-9993.1976.tb01118.x}}</ref>\n\n===Range===\nThe yellow-faced honeyeater ranges across a broad arc generally along the coastline from near [[Cooktown]] in [[Far North Queensland]], southwest between a line from [[Charters Towers]] to [[Albury]] and the coast, and then west to the [[Fleurieu Peninsula]] and Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia. Population densities have been recorded from 0.01 birds per hectare (2.5 acres) near [[Armidale]] in New South Wales to 7.8 birds per hectare at [[Tarnagulla, Victoria]].

It takes its common and scientific names from the distinctive yellow stripes on the sides of its head. Its loud, clear call often begins twenty or thirty minutes before dawn. It is widespread across eastern and southeastern Australia, in open [[sclerophyll]] forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude [[subalpine area]]s, and [[woodland]]s along creeks and rivers. Comparatively short-billed for a honeyeater, it is thought to have adapted to a diet of flies, spiders, and beetles, as well as nectar and pollen from the flowers of plants, such as ''[[Banksia]]'' and ''[[Grevillea]]'', and soft fruits. It catches insects in flight as well as [[Gleaning (birds)|gleaning]] them from the foliage of trees and shrubs.\n\nSome yellow-faced honeyeaters are sedentary, but hundreds of thousands [[bird migration|migrate]] northwards between March and May to spend the winter in southern [[Queensland]], and return in July and August to breed in southern [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. They form [[Monogamy in animals|socially monogamous]] pairs and lay two or three eggs in a delicate [[cup nest|cup-shaped nest]]. The success rate can be low, and the pairs nest several times during the breeding season.\n\nHoneyeaters' preferred woodland habitat is vulnerable to the effects of land-clearing, grazing, and weeds. As it is common and widespread, the yellow-faced honeyeater is considered by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) to be of [[least concern]] for conservation.

Above the yellow stripe is a black eye stripe which is broken by a small yellow to off-white patch behind the eye, and below is another distinct black stripe running the length of the yellow line. The chin, throat and breast are a pale greyish brown, streaked with slightly darker grey, and the abdomen is light grey. The upper body is a dark greyish brown to olive-brown. Olive-green outer edges on the [[Flight feather|remiges]] combine to form an olive panel on the folded wing. The bill is black and slightly down-curved, and the gape is cream. The legs and feet are grey-brown. The [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] is a dusky blue in adult birds, and brown in juveniles. The juvenile is very similar to the adult, with slightly less streaking on the breast, an orange-brown tip on the bill and a yellower gape; male and female birds are also similar, with the male being slightly larger (on average, {{convert|0.8|g|oz|abbr=on}} heavier); and in the field there are no visible differences between the subspecies. The yellow-faced honeyeater averages {{convert|15|-|17.5|cm|in}} in length, with a wingspan of {{convert|21.5|-|26|cm|in|abbr=on}} and a weight of {{convert|12.5|-|20.5|g|oz}}, with an average of {{convert|17|g|oz|abbr=on}}).{{sfn|Higgins|Christidis|Ford|2008|p=597}}{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=724}}\n\n===Vocalizations===\nOne of the first birds heard in the morning, the yellow-faced honeyeater utters calls that are full and loud, and extremely varied. The male sings from a roost for up to an hour, beginning twenty or thirty minutes before dawn.{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=724}} The song is a running series of cheerful notes sounding like ''chick-up, chick-up'', from which its common name of quitchup is derived.{{sfn|Officer|1965|p=50}} Counter-singing (repeating the first bird's song) by neighbouring birds is common. The territorial call, also given by opponents during fights, is a long ''preet'' with an upward inflection. The alarm call is a loud trilling whistle. Common calls, thought to be [[contact call]]s, are animated two-note calls variously described as ''terric, terric'', ''cr-rook, cr-rook'' or ''put-put, put-put''.{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=724}}\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n[[File:Yellow-faced Honeyeater callistemon.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Honeyeater balancing on a bottlebrush flower|The yellow-faced honeyeater can be seen feeding on garden shrubs.]]\n\n===Habitat===\nAcross its range, the yellow-faced honeyeater is found in a range of habitats\u2014in open [[sclerophyll]] forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude subalpine areas, and often in [[Riparian zone|riparian]] woodlands. It most commonly dwells in open forests dominated by spotted gum (''[[Corymbia maculata]]'') with [[ironbark]]s and [[stringybark]]s such as narrow-leaved ironbark (''[[Eucalyptus crebra]]'') and silver-leaved ironbark ([[Eucalyptus melanophloia|''E. melanophloia'']]), with a light shrubby [[understorey]], and less often in dry open forests and [[woodland]]s dominated by ''[[Angophora]]'', ''[[Acacia]]'', ''[[Banksia]]'', ''[[Casuarina]]'' or ''[[Callitris]]'', or in high-altitude, tall, open forests of alpine ash (''[[Eucalyptus delegatensis]]'') and woodlands dominated by snow gum (''[[Eucalyptus pauciflora|E. pauciflora]]'') or white box (''[[Eucalyptus albens|E. albens]]''). It has been recorded in coastal [[heath]] when banksias are blooming, and among flowering [[mangrove]]s. It occupies areas infested with weeds such as Scotch broom (''[[Cytisus scoparius]]'') and [[Blackberry|blackberries]], and developed areas including orchards and parks and gardens, where it feeds on cultivated fruit and flowers. It can be found in forests regenerating after [[Bushfires in Australia|fire]] or [[logging]], though it is more common in mature forests.{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=725}} Where it is found in woodland, it is usually woodland near forest or with an [[understory]] of sclerophyll plants.<ref name=\"Ford and Paton 76\">{{cite journal|last1=Ford|first1=Hugh A.|last2=Paton|first2=David C.|title=Resource partitioning and competition in honeyeaters of the genus ''Meliphaga''|journal=Australian Journal of Ecology|date=1976|volume=1|issue=4|pages=281\u2013287|doi=10.1111/j.1442-9993.1976.tb01118.x}}</ref>\n\n===Range===\nThe yellow-faced honeyeater ranges across a broad arc generally along the coastline from near [[Cooktown]] in [[Far North Queensland]], southwest between a line from [[Charters Towers]] to [[Albury]] and the coast, and then west to the [[Fleurieu Peninsula]] and Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia. Population densities have been recorded from 0.01 birds per hectare (2.5 acres) near [[Armidale]] in New South Wales to 7.8 birds per hectare at [[Tarnagulla, Victoria]].

[[Ellie Goulding]]'s single \"[[Love Me Like You Do]]\" was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song]].\n\nIt is the first installment in the [[Fifty Shades (film series)|''Fifty Shades'' film trilogy]] and was followed by two sequels, ''[[Fifty Shades Darker (film)|Fifty Shades Darker]]'' and ''[[Fifty Shades Freed (film)|Fifty Shades Freed]]'', released in 2017 and 2018, respectively.\n\n==Plot==\n21-year-old Anastasia \"Ana\" Steele is an English literature major at [[Washington State University]]\u2019s satellite campus near [[Vancouver, Washington]]. When her roommate, Kate Kavanagh, becomes ill and is unable to interview Christian Grey, a 27-year-old [[billionaire]] entrepreneur, for the college newspaper, Ana agrees to go in her place. At Christian's [[Seattle]] headquarters called Grey House, Ana stumbles her way through the meeting. Christian, who is that year's WSU [[Graduation|commencement]] speaker, takes an interest in her; soon after, he visits the hardware store where Ana works, and offers to do a photo shoot to accompany the article for which Ana had interviewed him.\n\nChristian invites Ana for coffee, but leaves abruptly after Ana confesses to being a romantic, saying he is not the man for her. Christian later sends Ana first edition copies of two [[Thomas Hardy]] novels, including ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'', as a gift, with a quote from the latter book about the dangers of relationships, on an accompanying card.\n\nAna and her friends celebrate graduation at a local bar. After drinking too much, Ana spontaneously calls Christian, saying she is returning the books, and berating his behavior towards her. Christian goes to the bar to find Ana, who then passes out. She wakes up the next morning in Christian's hotel room, but is relieved to find that they were not intimate.\n\nAna and Christian begin seeing each other, though he insists that she sign a [[non-disclosure agreement]] preventing her from revealing details about their dalliance. Christian explains that he has [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] relationships, but only as clearly defined in a contract between the participants. Ana reveals that she is a virgin. While considering the agreement and negotiating her own terms, and after visiting his \"playroom,\" a room stocked with a variety of [[BDSM]] toys, furniture, and gear, she and Christian have sex. Ana also meets Christian\u2019s mother. Ana asks Christian how many girls had lived in his house while he takes her home.\n\nChristian bestows a series of gifts and favors upon Ana, including a new car and a computer laptop. After Ana and Kate move to Seattle, Ana continues seeing Christian. During dinner at Christian's parents, Ana suddenly mentions she is leaving the next day to visit her mother in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Later, Christian becomes frustrated when Ana says that she wants more than the one-sided relationship he proposes. She is shocked when Christian unexpectedly arrives in Georgia; he takes her flying but leaves soon afterward, to tend to an emergency in Seattle.\n\nAfter returning home, Ana continues seeing Christian, who wants further sexual experimentation. Ana initially consents, but Christian keeps emotionally distant, upsetting her. While still considering the contract, and in an effort to understand Christian psychologically, Ana asks him to demonstrate how he would \"punish\" her for rule-breaking. Christian whips Ana's buttocks with a belt. Upset and disgusted, Ana breaks up with Christian after concluding that he is wrong for her and his practices border on deviant and excessive.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Multiple image\n  | direction = vertical\n  | footer = [[Jamie Dornan]] and [[Dakota Johnson]].\n  | image1 = Jamie Dornan January 2013.jpg\n  | width1 = 132\n  | image2 = Dakota Johnson 2014 (cropped).jpg\n  | width2 = 132\n}}\n* [[Dakota Johnson]] as Anastasia \"Ana\" Steele, a 21-year-old English Literature student attending [[Washington State University]].\n* [[Jamie Dornan]] as Christian Grey, a 27-year-old billionaire, entrepreneur, and CEO of Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.\n* [[Eloise Mumford]] as Katherine \"Kate\" Kavanagh,<ref name=\"mumford\">{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/news/eloise-mumford-fifty-shades-of-grey-1200865898/ |title='Fifty Shades': Eloise Mumford Tapped to Play Anastasia Steele's Roommate |date=November 22, 2013 |accessdate=December 4, 2013 |first=Justin |last=Kroll |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref> Anastasia's best friend/roommate who begins a relationship with Christian's older brother, Elliot Grey.\n* [[Jennifer Ehle]] as Carla Wilks,<ref name=\"elhe\">{{cite web|last=Fleming Jr|first=Mike|title=Jennifer Ehle Joining 'Fifty Shades Of Grey' As Anastasia Steele's Mother|url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/10/jennifer-ehle-joining-fifty-shades-of-grey-as-anastasia-steeles-mother/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |accessdate=October 8, 2013 |date=October 7, 2013}}</ref> Anastasia's mother.\n* [[Marcia Gay Harden]] as Dr. Grace Trevelyan-Grey,<ref name=\"harden\">{{cite web|last=Kit|first=Borys|title='Fifty Shades of Grey' Adds Marcia Gay Harden as Christian Grey's Mother |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/fifty-shades-grey-adds-marcia-661732 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=December 4, 2013 |date=December 3, 2013}}</ref> Christian Grey's adoptive mother.\n* [[Victor Rasuk]] as Jose Rodriguez,<ref name=\"rasuk\">{{cite news|first=Jeff|last=Sneider|title='Fifty Shades of Grey' Casts 'How to Make It in America' Star Victor Rasuk as Jose|url=http://www.thewrap.com/fifty-shades-grey-casts-make-america-star-victor-rasuk-jose/|work=[[TheWrap]]|date=October 31, 2013 |accessdate=November 1, 2013}}</ref> one of Anastasia's close friends.\n* [[Luke Grimes]] as Elliot Grey,<ref>{{cite web|last=Kit|first=Borys|title='True Blood' Actor Joins 'Fifty Shades of Grey' |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/fifty-shades-grey-luke-grimes-650995|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=December 4, 2013|date=October 25, 2013}}</ref> Christian's adopted older brother.\n* [[Rita Ora]] as Mia Grey,<ref>{{cite tweet|author=Rita Ora|author-link=Rita Ora|user=RitaOra|title=It's official!

When her roommate, Kate Kavanagh, becomes ill and is unable to interview Christian Grey, a 27-year-old [[billionaire]] entrepreneur, for the college newspaper, Ana agrees to go in her place. At Christian's [[Seattle]] headquarters called Grey House, Ana stumbles her way through the meeting. Christian, who is that year's WSU [[Graduation|commencement]] speaker, takes an interest in her; soon after, he visits the hardware store where Ana works, and offers to do a photo shoot to accompany the article for which Ana had interviewed him.\n\nChristian invites Ana for coffee, but leaves abruptly after Ana confesses to being a romantic, saying he is not the man for her. Christian later sends Ana first edition copies of two [[Thomas Hardy]] novels, including ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'', as a gift, with a quote from the latter book about the dangers of relationships, on an accompanying card.\n\nAna and her friends celebrate graduation at a local bar. After drinking too much, Ana spontaneously calls Christian, saying she is returning the books, and berating his behavior towards her. Christian goes to the bar to find Ana, who then passes out. She wakes up the next morning in Christian's hotel room, but is relieved to find that they were not intimate.\n\nAna and Christian begin seeing each other, though he insists that she sign a [[non-disclosure agreement]] preventing her from revealing details about their dalliance. Christian explains that he has [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] relationships, but only as clearly defined in a contract between the participants. Ana reveals that she is a virgin. While considering the agreement and negotiating her own terms, and after visiting his \"playroom,\" a room stocked with a variety of [[BDSM]] toys, furniture, and gear, she and Christian have sex. Ana also meets Christian\u2019s mother. Ana asks Christian how many girls had lived in his house while he takes her home.\n\nChristian bestows a series of gifts and favors upon Ana, including a new car and a computer laptop. After Ana and Kate move to Seattle, Ana continues seeing Christian. During dinner at Christian's parents, Ana suddenly mentions she is leaving the next day to visit her mother in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Later, Christian becomes frustrated when Ana says that she wants more than the one-sided relationship he proposes. She is shocked when Christian unexpectedly arrives in Georgia; he takes her flying but leaves soon afterward, to tend to an emergency in Seattle.\n\nAfter returning home, Ana continues seeing Christian, who wants further sexual experimentation. Ana initially consents, but Christian keeps emotionally distant, upsetting her. While still considering the contract, and in an effort to understand Christian psychologically, Ana asks him to demonstrate how he would \"punish\" her for rule-breaking.

They drew inspiration from the existing emoji designs as well as the character [[List of Dr. Slump characters#Poop-Boy|Poop-Boy]] from the ''[[Dr. Slump]]'' manga by [[Akira Toriyama]]. They limited themselves to a size of 15\u00d715 pixels and colors used only in Google's logo.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3037803/the-oral-history-of-the-poop-emoji-or-how-google-brought-poop-to-america|title=The Oral History Of The Poop Emoji (Or, How Google Brought Poop To America) &#124; Fast Company|last=Schwartzberg|first=Lauren|date=18 November 2014|language=English|accessdate=29 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/24687/1/what-does-the-stinky-poop-emoji-really-mean|title=What does the stinky poop emoji really mean?
