His father worked as an electronics engineer at [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]]. His mother later became a teacher. The family had left Scotland in part because work for his father's engineering skills was in short supply and in part because of the tensions in the extended family caused by his parents' \"[[Interfaith marriage|mixed marriage]]\", his father being Catholic and his mother Presbyterian. Byrne recounted these events when he appeared on ''[[Desert Island Discs]]'' on [[BBC Radio 4]] on 18 March 2018.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09vz6r1|title=BBC Radio 4 \u2013 Desert Island Discs, David Byrne|website=BBC|accessdate=23 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nBefore high school, Byrne already knew how to play the guitar, accordion, and violin. He was rejected from his [[middle school]]'s choir because they claimed he was \"off-[[Key (music)|key]] and too withdrawn\". From a young age, he had a strong interest in music. His parents say that he would constantly play his [[phonograph]] from age three and he learned how to play the harmonica at age five.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C962640-8%2C00.html |title=\"Rock's Renaissance Man.\" TIME Magazine.

He started his musical career in a high school band called Revelation, then between 1971 and 1972, he was one half of a duo named Bizadi with Marc Kehoe. Their repertoire consisted mostly of songs such as \"[[April Showers (song)|April Showers]]\", \"[[96 Tears]]\", \"[[Dancing on the Ceiling (1930 song)|Dancing on the Ceiling]]\" and [[Frank Sinatra]] songs. Byrne attended the [[Rhode Island School of Design]] (during the 1970\u201371 term) and the [[Maryland Institute College of Art]] (during the 1971\u201372 term) before dropping out. He returned to Providence in 1973 and formed a band called the Artistics with fellow RISD student [[Chris Frantz]].<ref>Gittins, Ian, ''Talking Heads: Once in a Lifetime : the Stories Behind Every Song'', [[Hal Leonard Corporation]], 2004, p. 140 {{ISBN|0-634-08033-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-634-08033-3}}.</ref> The band dissolved in 1974. Byrne moved to [[New York City]] in May that year, and in September of that year,  Frantz and his girlfriend [[Tina Weymouth]] followed suit. Unable to find a bass player in New York, Frantz and Byrne persuaded Weymouth to learn to play the bass guitar. Byrne gave her lessons. While working day jobs in late 1974, they were contemplating a band.\n\n===Talking Heads: 1975\u20131991===\n{{main|Talking Heads}}\nBy January 1975, they were practicing and playing together, while still working normal day jobs.

The band released eight studio albums before going into hiatus in 1988. Byrne desired to go solo, but it took three years until 1991 to announce that the band was breaking up. A brief reunion for a single \"[[Sax and Violins]]\" in 1991 occurred before dissolving again. The band was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2002, when they reunited to play four tracks, including \"[[Psycho Killer]]\" and \"[[Burning Down the House]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/ceremonies/2002/|title=2002 Induction Ceremony|publisher=The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum|accessdate=15 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Solo album career: 1979\u20131981, 1989\u2013present===\nDuring his time in the band, Byrne took on outside projects, collaborating with [[Brian Eno]] during 1979 and 1981 on the album ''[[My Life in the Bush of Ghosts (album)|My Life in the Bush of Ghosts]]'', which attracted considerable critical acclaim due to its early use of analogue [[sampling (music)|sampling]] and [[Found object|found sounds]]. Following this record, Byrne focused his attention on Talking Heads. ''My Life in the Bush of Ghosts'' was re-released for its 25th anniversary in early 2006, with new bonus tracks. In keeping with the spirit of the original album, [[stem (audio)|stems]] for two of the songs' component tracks were released under [[Creative Commons]] licenses and a remix contest site was launched.\n\n''[[Rei Momo]]'' (1989) was the first solo album by Byrne after leaving Talking Heads, and features mainly Afro-Cuban, Afro-Hispanic, and Brazilian song styles including popular dances such as [[merengue music|merengue]], [[son cubano]], [[samba]], [[mambo (music)|mambo]], [[cumbia]], [[Cha-cha-ch\u00e1 (music)|cha-cha-ch\u00e1]], [[Bomba (Puerto Rico)|bomba]] and [[Charanga (Cuba)|charanga]]. His third solo album, ''[[Uh-Oh (David Byrne album)|Uh-Oh]]'' (1992), featured a brass section and was driven by tracks such as \"Girls on My Mind\" and \"The Cowboy Mambo (Hey Lookit Me Now)\". His fourth solo album, titled ''[[David Byrne (album)|David Byrne]]'' (1994), was a more proper rock record, with Byrne playing most of the instruments on it, leaving percussion for session musicians. \"Angels\" and \"Back in the Box\" were the two main singles released from the album. The first one entered the US [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] chart, reaching No. 24. For his fifth studio effort the emotional ''[[Feelings (David Byrne album)|Feelings]]'' (1997), Byrne employed a brass orchestra called Black Cat Orchestra. His sixth ''[[Look into the Eyeball]]'' (2001) continued the same musical exploration of ''Feelings'', but was compiled of more upbeat tracks, like those found on ''Uh-Oh''.\n\n''[[Grown Backwards]]'' (2004), released by [[Nonesuch Records]], used orchestral string arrangements, and includes two operatic [[aria]]s as well as a rework of [[X-Press 2]] collaboration \"[[David Byrne#Other musical contributions: 1990\u2013present|Lazy]]\". He also launched a North American and Australian tour with the Tosca Strings. This tour ended with [[Los Angeles]], [[San Diego]] and New York shows in August 2005. He  also collaborated with [[Selena]] on her 1995 album ''[[Dreaming of You (Selena album)|Dreaming of You]]'' with \"God's Child (Baila Conmigo)\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/composition/7ab34001-d0f7-416f-9914-17a9f4e16f6a-Gods-Child-Baila-Conmigo|title=God's Child (Baila Conmigo)|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2019-01-22}}</ref>\n\n[[File:DavidByrneFestivalHall2009.jpg|thumb|right|Byrne at London's [[Royal Festival Hall]], 2009]]\nByrne and Eno reunited for his eighth album ''[[Everything That Happens Will Happen Today]]'' (2008).<ref name=\"tour\">{{cite web |url=http://www.everythingthathappens.com/tour.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822132005/http://www.everythingthathappens.com/tour.html |archivedate=22 August 2008 |title=Tour Dates for David Byrne \u2013 Songs of David Byrne and Brian Eno |publisher=David Byrne |date=4 August 2008 |accessdate=11 January 2010 }}</ref> He assembled a band to tour worldwide for the album for a six-month period from late 2008 through early 2009 on the [[Songs of David Byrne and Brian Eno Tour]].<ref>{{cite web |title=DavidByrne.com \u2013 Tours |url=http://www.davidbyrne.com/tours/index.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316041327/http://www.davidbyrne.com/tours/index.php |url-status=dead |archive-date=16 March 2009 |date=16 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012 he released a collaborative album with American singer-songwriter [[St. Vincent (musician)|St. Vincent]] called ''[[Love This Giant]]''.\n\nIn January 2018, Byrne announced his first solo album in 14 years.

Productions of ''The Catherine Wheel'' appeared on Broadway that same year. ''[[In Spite of Wishing and Wanting]]'' is a soundscape David Byrne produced for the Belgian choreographer [[Wim Vandekeybus]]'s dance company Ultima Vez.\n\nByrne wrote, directed, and starred in ''[[True Stories (film)|True Stories]]'', a musical collage of discordant [[Americana (music)|Americana]] released in 1986, as well as producing most of the film's music. Byrne also directed the documentary ''\u00cele Aiye'' and the concert film of his 1992 Latin-tinged tour titled ''Between the Teeth''. He was chiefly responsible for the stage design and choreography of ''[[Stop Making Sense]]'' in 1984.\n\nByrne was impressed by the experimental theatre that he saw in New York City in the 1970s. He collaborated with several of its best-known representatives. He worked with Robert Wilson on \"The Knee Plays\" and \"The Forest\", and invited [[Spalding Gray]] (of The Wooster Group) to act in ''True Stories'', while Meredith Monk provided a small part of that film's soundtrack. Byrne provided a soundtrack for JoAnne Akalaitis' film \"Dead End Kids\", made after a Mabou Mines theatre production. Byrne's artistic outlook has a great deal in common with the work of these artists.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Steenstra|first1=Sytze|title=Song and Circumstance|date=2010|publisher=Continuum Books|location=New York and London|isbn=978-08264-4168-3|pages=93\u2013137}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991, Byrne released a classical instrumental album ''[[The Forest (album)|The Forest]]'', where some of the tracks were already featured as a score for 1988 Robert Wilson theatre piece of the same name.\n\nHis work has been extensively used in film [[soundtrack]]s, most notably in collaboration with [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]] and [[Cong Su]] on [[Bernardo Bertolucci]]'s ''[[The Last Emperor]]'', which won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]]. In 2004, ''[[Lead Us Not into Temptation]]'' included tracks and musical experiments from his score to ''[[Young Adam (film)|Young Adam]]''. Byrne added \"Loco de Amor\" with [[Celia Cruz]] to [[Jonathan Demme]]'s 1986 film ''[[Something Wild (1986 film)|Something Wild]]''.\n\nByrne wrote the [[Dirty Dozen Brass Band]]-inspired score for [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]]'s Opera ''[[Music for \"The Knee Plays\"|The Knee Plays]]'' from ''[[The Civil Wars: A Tree Is Best Measured When It Is Down]]''. Some of the music from Byrne's orchestral album ''[[The Forest (album)|The Forest]]'' was originally used in a Wilson-directed theatre piece with the same name. ''The Forest'' premiered at the ''Theater der Freien Volksb\u00fchne'', Berlin, in 1988. It received its New York premiere in December 1988 at the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] (BAM).

His father worked as an electronics engineer at [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]]. His mother later became a teacher. The family had left Scotland in part because work for his father's engineering skills was in short supply and in part because of the tensions in the extended family caused by his parents' \"[[Interfaith marriage|mixed marriage]]\", his father being Catholic and his mother Presbyterian.

Their repertoire consisted mostly of songs such as \"[[April Showers (song)|April Showers]]\", \"[[96 Tears]]\", \"[[Dancing on the Ceiling (1930 song)|Dancing on the Ceiling]]\" and [[Frank Sinatra]] songs. Byrne attended the [[Rhode Island School of Design]] (during the 1970\u201371 term) and the [[Maryland Institute College of Art]] (during the 1971\u201372 term) before dropping out. He returned to Providence in 1973 and formed a band called the Artistics with fellow RISD student [[Chris Frantz]].<ref>Gittins, Ian, ''Talking Heads: Once in a Lifetime : the Stories Behind Every Song'', [[Hal Leonard Corporation]], 2004, p. 140 {{ISBN|0-634-08033-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-634-08033-3}}.</ref> The band dissolved in 1974. Byrne moved to [[New York City]] in May that year, and in September of that year,  Frantz and his girlfriend [[Tina Weymouth]] followed suit. Unable to find a bass player in New York, Frantz and Byrne persuaded Weymouth to learn to play the bass guitar. Byrne gave her lessons.

Following this record, Byrne focused his attention on Talking Heads. ''My Life in the Bush of Ghosts'' was re-released for its 25th anniversary in early 2006, with new bonus tracks. In keeping with the spirit of the original album, [[stem (audio)|stems]] for two of the songs' component tracks were released under [[Creative Commons]] licenses and a remix contest site was launched.\n\n''[[Rei Momo]]'' (1989) was the first solo album by Byrne after leaving Talking Heads, and features mainly Afro-Cuban, Afro-Hispanic, and Brazilian song styles including popular dances such as [[merengue music|merengue]], [[son cubano]], [[samba]], [[mambo (music)|mambo]], [[cumbia]], [[Cha-cha-ch\u00e1 (music)|cha-cha-ch\u00e1]], [[Bomba (Puerto Rico)|bomba]] and [[Charanga (Cuba)|charanga]]. His third solo album, ''[[Uh-Oh (David Byrne album)|Uh-Oh]]'' (1992), featured a brass section and was driven by tracks such as \"Girls on My Mind\" and \"The Cowboy Mambo (Hey Lookit Me Now)\". His fourth solo album, titled ''[[David Byrne (album)|David Byrne]]'' (1994), was a more proper rock record, with Byrne playing most of the instruments on it, leaving percussion for session musicians. \"Angels\" and \"Back in the Box\" were the two main singles released from the album. The first one entered the US [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] chart, reaching No. 24. For his fifth studio effort the emotional ''[[Feelings (David Byrne album)|Feelings]]'' (1997), Byrne employed a brass orchestra called Black Cat Orchestra. His sixth ''[[Look into the Eyeball]]'' (2001) continued the same musical exploration of ''Feelings'', but was compiled of more upbeat tracks, like those found on ''Uh-Oh''.\n\n''[[Grown Backwards]]'' (2004), released by [[Nonesuch Records]], used orchestral string arrangements, and includes two operatic [[aria]]s as well as a rework of [[X-Press 2]] collaboration \"[[David Byrne#Other musical contributions: 1990\u2013present|Lazy]]\". He also launched a North American and Australian tour with the Tosca Strings. This tour ended with [[Los Angeles]], [[San Diego]] and New York shows in August 2005. He  also collaborated with [[Selena]] on her 1995 album ''[[Dreaming of You (Selena album)|Dreaming of You]]'' with \"God's Child (Baila Conmigo)\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/composition/7ab34001-d0f7-416f-9914-17a9f4e16f6a-Gods-Child-Baila-Conmigo|title=God's Child (Baila Conmigo)|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2019-01-22}}</ref>\n\n[[File:DavidByrneFestivalHall2009.jpg|thumb|right|Byrne at London's [[Royal Festival Hall]], 2009]]\nByrne and Eno reunited for his eighth album ''[[Everything That Happens Will Happen Today]]'' (2008).<ref name=\"tour\">{{cite web |url=http://www.everythingthathappens.com/tour.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822132005/http://www.everythingthathappens.com/tour.html |archivedate=22 August 2008 |title=Tour Dates for David Byrne \u2013 Songs of David Byrne and Brian Eno |publisher=David Byrne |date=4 August 2008 |accessdate=11 January 2010 }}</ref> He assembled a band to tour worldwide for the album for a six-month period from late 2008 through early 2009 on the [[Songs of David Byrne and Brian Eno Tour]].<ref>{{cite web |title=DavidByrne.com \u2013 Tours |url=http://www.davidbyrne.com/tours/index.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316041327/http://www.davidbyrne.com/tours/index.php |url-status=dead |archive-date=16 March 2009 |date=16 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012 he released a collaborative album with American singer-songwriter [[St. Vincent (musician)|St. Vincent]] called ''[[Love This Giant]]''.\n\nIn January 2018, Byrne announced his first solo album in 14 years.

Productions of ''The Catherine Wheel'' appeared on Broadway that same year. ''[[In Spite of Wishing and Wanting]]'' is a soundscape David Byrne produced for the Belgian choreographer [[Wim Vandekeybus]]'s dance company Ultima Vez.\n\nByrne wrote, directed, and starred in ''[[True Stories (film)|True Stories]]'', a musical collage of discordant [[Americana (music)|Americana]] released in 1986, as well as producing most of the film's music. Byrne also directed the documentary ''\u00cele Aiye'' and the concert film of his 1992 Latin-tinged tour titled ''Between the Teeth''. He was chiefly responsible for the stage design and choreography of ''[[Stop Making Sense]]'' in 1984.\n\nByrne was impressed by the experimental theatre that he saw in New York City in the 1970s. He collaborated with several of its best-known representatives. He worked with Robert Wilson on \"The Knee Plays\" and \"The Forest\", and invited [[Spalding Gray]] (of The Wooster Group) to act in ''True Stories'', while Meredith Monk provided a small part of that film's soundtrack. Byrne provided a soundtrack for JoAnne Akalaitis' film \"Dead End Kids\", made after a Mabou Mines theatre production. Byrne's artistic outlook has a great deal in common with the work of these artists.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Steenstra|first1=Sytze|title=Song and Circumstance|date=2010|publisher=Continuum Books|location=New York and London|isbn=978-08264-4168-3|pages=93\u2013137}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991, Byrne released a classical instrumental album ''[[The Forest (album)|The Forest]]'', where some of the tracks were already featured as a score for 1988 Robert Wilson theatre piece of the same name.\n\nHis work has been extensively used in film [[soundtrack]]s, most notably in collaboration with [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]] and [[Cong Su]] on [[Bernardo Bertolucci]]'s ''[[The Last Emperor]]'', which won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]]. In 2004, ''[[Lead Us Not into Temptation]]'' included tracks and musical experiments from his score to ''[[Young Adam (film)|Young Adam]]''. Byrne added \"Loco de Amor\" with [[Celia Cruz]] to [[Jonathan Demme]]'s 1986 film ''[[Something Wild (1986 film)|Something Wild]]''.\n\nByrne wrote the [[Dirty Dozen Brass Band]]-inspired score for [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]]'s Opera ''[[Music for \"The Knee Plays\"|The Knee Plays]]'' from ''[[The Civil Wars: A Tree Is Best Measured When It Is Down]]''. Some of the music from Byrne's orchestral album ''[[The Forest (album)|The Forest]]'' was originally used in a Wilson-directed theatre piece with the same name. ''The Forest'' premiered at the ''Theater der Freien Volksb\u00fchne'', Berlin, in 1988. It received its New York premiere in December 1988 at the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] (BAM). The Forestry Maxi-single contained dance and industrial remixes of pieces from ''The Forest'' by [[Jack Dangers]], Rudy Tambala, and Anthony Capel.\n\nIn late 2005, Byrne and [[Norman Cook|Fatboy Slim]] began work on ''[[Here Lies Love]]'', a [[disco]] opera or [[song cycle]] about the life of [[Imelda Marcos]], the controversial former First Lady of the [[Philippines]]. Some music from this piece was debuted at [[Adelaide Festival|Adelaide Festival of Arts]] in Australia in February 2006 and the following year at [[Carnegie Hall]] on 3 February 2007.\n\nIn 2008, Byrne released ''[[Big Love: Hymnal]]'' \u2013 his soundtrack to season two of ''[[Big Love]]''.

He is said to have been descended from Prophet Mohammed's daughter [[Fatimah]]. Hence the Sheikh belonged to the [[Ashraf]] or [[Sayyid|Sada]], titles given to the descendants of the prophet. He married two local women in Somalia that left him eight sons, one of them being Abdirahman (Awal). The descendants of those eight sons are the what is known as Isaaq clan today.\n\nThe grave of Zubeyr Awal, the eponymous ancestor of the Habr Awal subclan of the [[Isaaq]], is located in Jidali in [[Sanaag]] which is about 100&nbsp;km east of the tomb of his grandfather Sheikh Ishaaq Bin Ahmed, the founding father of the [[Isaaq]] clan, whose tomb is located in the coastal town of [[Maydh]].\n\n===Medieval Period (Conquest of Abbysinia)===\n\nHistorically the Habr Awal were part of the [[Adal Sultanate]] and are mentioned in the renowned \"Futuh Al-Habash\" for their major contributions in the [[Abyssinian-Adal war]] as the Habr Magaadle along with the [[Garhajis]], Arap and Ayub clans against the [[Abyssinian empire]], and also for producing a historical figure known as Ahmad Girri bin Husain who was the righthand partner of [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]] and a chieftain for the Habr Magaadle forces during the Abyssinian\u2013Adal war.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://makhtota.ksu.edu.sa/makhtota/554/16|title=\u0645\u062e\u0637\u0648\u0637\u0627\u062a > \u0628\u0647\u062c\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0645\u0627\u0646 > \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0641\u062d\u0629 \u0631\u0642\u0645 16|website=makhtota.ksu.edu.sa|access-date=2017-08-24}}</ref>\n\n===Early Modern Period===\n\nThe Habr Awal have a rich mercantile history largely due to their possession of the major Somali port of [[Berbera]], which was the chief port and settlement of Habr Awal clan during the early modern period.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://reerahmednuux.wordpress.com/2015/08/21/piece-of-berbera-history-reer-ahmed-nuh-ismail/ |title=Piece of Berbera History: Reer Ahmed Nuh Ismail |website=wordpress.com|date=21 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The Habr Awal as a whole are a rich people, mainly thanks to the trade passing though the port of Berbera which lies in the territory of the Sa\u2019ad Musa.<ref>{{cite book|title= Ethnographic Survey of Africa, Volume 5 |date=1969|pages=24|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n[[File:Berbera Mosque Engraving.jpg|thumb|350px|Engraving of Berbera, including a Mosque and fort]]\nThe Habr Awal merchants had extensive trade relations with Arab and Indian merchants from [[Arabia]] and the [[Indian subcontinent]] respectively. When these foreign traders arrived in [[Berbera]] and [[Bulhar]] to conduct trade, there was a mutually beneficial arrangement based on the abban (protection) system between them and the local Reer Yunis Nuh and Ahmed Nuh lineages of Sa\u2019ad Musa, Habr Awal:\n\n<blockquote>Before this, and prior to the British settlement at Aden in 1839, the Ayyal Yunis and Ayyal Ahmed lineages of the Habr Awal clan had held Berbera and jointly managed its trade, sharing in the profits on all commercial transactions as \u2018protectors\u2019 (abans) of foreign merchants from Arabia and India. When under the stimulus of developments at Aden the port\u2019s prosperity markedly increased, the numerically dominant Ayyal Yunis drove out their rival kinsmen and declared themselves commercial masters of Berbera. This led to a feud in which each side sought outside help; the defeated Ayyal Ahmed turned to Haji Shirmarke \u2018Ali and his Habr Yunis clansmen for support. With this backing, they were then able to re-establish themselves and to expel the Ayyal Yunis who moved to the small roadstead of Bulhar, some miles to the west of Berbera.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=I.M.|title= The Modern History of Somaliland: from Nation to State |date=1965|publisher=Praeger|pages=35|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nNot only did the Habr Awal host foreign merchants at their ports, they also conducted trade missions on their own vessels to the Arabian ports<ref>{{cite book|last1=Prichard|first1=J.

The majority of the Somali merchants who frequented Aden and other Southern Arabian ports hailed from the Habr Awal clan. They procured various raw goods from Harar and the interior in exchange for manufactured goods. During their stay, the Habr Awal rented their own houses and hired their own servants, whereas other Somali clans tended to stay with relatives already established across the Gulf. \n\n<blockquote>Merchants. \u2014 These are generally members of the Habr Awal tribe. They bring from Harrar and the Galla country, coffee, saffron (bastard), tusks (ivory), and feathers, taking away in return zinc, brass, broad cloth, and piece goods. They remain in Aden for about twenty days at a time during the trading season, which lasts about nine months,' making four trips. During their residence they hire a house, and are accompanied by their own domestics.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Frederick|title=An Account of the British Settlement of Aden in Arabia|date=1877|publisher=Cengage Gale|pages=41|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the interior, Habr Awal trade caravans (khafilas) were a frequent sight according to contemporary European accounts of the Somali Peninsula:\n\n<blockquote>On leaving Hargeisa we travelled for many miles through beautiful park-like land, alive with birds and jungle fowl. We met the usual Somali khafilas [trading caravans] of Habr-Awal men, carrying their skins, gums, ghee, and coffee to our port at Bulhar, situated between Berbera and Zeila.<ref>'Twixt sirdar & Menelik: an account of a year's expedition from Zeila to Cairo, p. 18, 1901</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Somalis from the deep interior, principally those from the [[Ogaden (clan)|Ogaden]], also gained most of their resources from the Habr Awal merchants who they called \"iidoor\", an enviable pejorative meaning [[merchant]] or trader, a reference to the mercantile nature of the Habr Awal traders at the time.<ref name=\"Info\">Somali Poetry, Lewis & Adrzejewski, 1964, pp. 111\u2013115</ref> The coastal Habr Awal (mainly the Reer Ahmed Nuh) regularly acted as brokers/middlemen for the Somali clans of the interior who wished to take their goods to the ports of Berbera and Bulhar:\n\n<blockquote>The custom is for the Ayal Achmet (Berbera tribe) to act as brokers, and too often most of the profits stick to the hands of the middleman.

The Habr Awal continued to have a lucrative trading agreement with their foreign contacts, many of whom were also under British rule in their respective nations.

Habr Awal Commanders carried out many successful operations that led to the decisive victory of the group and to the downfall of the Siad Barre regime.\n\nIn western Somaliland, this group was prominently represented in the 99 division of the [[Somali National Movement]] which was founded in [[Gabiley]] with the majority of the divisions troops consisting of militia fighters hailing from the Jibril Abokor section of the Sa'ad Muuse sub-clan of the Habr Awal that dominates the [[Gabiley]] region. The 99 division was Commanded by General [[Mohamed Hasan Abdullahi]] (Jidhif) of the Jibril Abokor who successfully conquered [[Awdal]] region and completely erased the presence of [[Somali National Army]] forces within [[Gabiley]] and [[Awdal]] and forced the local [[Gadabursi]] inhabitants of [[Awdal]] to pledge loyalty to [[Somaliland]]. As commander of the 99 division, General [[Mohamed Hasan Abdullahi]] (Jidhif) also established a [[Somali National Movement]] military base in [[Zeila]] where the [[Somali National Movement|SNM]] occupied the Awdal region for 4 years and successfully defeated attempts by USF militia forces loyal to [[Djibouti]] who tried to take advantage of the fall of Siad Barre's [[Military Junta]] in 1991 and annex the city of [[Zeila]].<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/?id=lAyeNqKK7bQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=jibril+abokor+militia#v=onepage&q&f=false |title= Hassan Ali Jama, Who cares about Somalia |isbn= 9783899300758 |last1= Jama |first1= Hassan Ali |year= 2005 }}</ref>\n\nIn central Somaliland, [[Muse Bihi Abdi]] and his Hussein Abokor section of the Sa'ad Muuse sub-clan of the Habr Awal successfully liberated [[Hargeisa]] from the brutal communist regime and played a preeminent role for the SNM where they liberated [[Hargeisa]], and [[Faraweyne]].

He is said to have been descended from Prophet Mohammed's daughter [[Fatimah]]. Hence the Sheikh belonged to the [[Ashraf]] or [[Sayyid|Sada]], titles given to the descendants of the prophet. He married two local women in Somalia that left him eight sons, one of them being Abdirahman (Awal). The descendants of those eight sons are the what is known as Isaaq clan today.\n\nThe grave of Zubeyr Awal, the eponymous ancestor of the Habr Awal subclan of the [[Isaaq]], is located in Jidali in [[Sanaag]] which is about 100&nbsp;km east of the tomb of his grandfather Sheikh Ishaaq Bin Ahmed, the founding father of the [[Isaaq]] clan, whose tomb is located in the coastal town of [[Maydh]].\n\n===Medieval Period (Conquest of Abbysinia)===\n\nHistorically the Habr Awal were part of the [[Adal Sultanate]] and are mentioned in the renowned \"Futuh Al-Habash\" for their major contributions in the [[Abyssinian-Adal war]] as the Habr Magaadle along with the [[Garhajis]], Arap and Ayub clans against the [[Abyssinian empire]], and also for producing a historical figure known as Ahmad Girri bin Husain who was the righthand partner of [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]] and a chieftain for the Habr Magaadle forces during the Abyssinian\u2013Adal war.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://makhtota.ksu.edu.sa/makhtota/554/16|title=\u0645\u062e\u0637\u0648\u0637\u0627\u062a > \u0628\u0647\u062c\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0645\u0627\u0646 > \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0641\u062d\u0629 \u0631\u0642\u0645 16|website=makhtota.ksu.edu.sa|access-date=2017-08-24}}</ref>\n\n===Early Modern Period===\n\nThe Habr Awal have a rich mercantile history largely due to their possession of the major Somali port of [[Berbera]], which was the chief port and settlement of Habr Awal clan during the early modern period.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://reerahmednuux.wordpress.com/2015/08/21/piece-of-berbera-history-reer-ahmed-nuh-ismail/ |title=Piece of Berbera History: Reer Ahmed Nuh Ismail |website=wordpress.com|date=21 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The Habr Awal as a whole are a rich people, mainly thanks to the trade passing though the port of Berbera which lies in the territory of the Sa\u2019ad Musa.<ref>{{cite book|title= Ethnographic Survey of Africa, Volume 5 |date=1969|pages=24|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n[[File:Berbera Mosque Engraving.jpg|thumb|350px|Engraving of Berbera, including a Mosque and fort]]\nThe Habr Awal merchants had extensive trade relations with Arab and Indian merchants from [[Arabia]] and the [[Indian subcontinent]] respectively. When these foreign traders arrived in [[Berbera]] and [[Bulhar]] to conduct trade, there was a mutually beneficial arrangement based on the abban (protection) system between them and the local Reer Yunis Nuh and Ahmed Nuh lineages of Sa\u2019ad Musa, Habr Awal:\n\n<blockquote>Before this, and prior to the British settlement at Aden in 1839, the Ayyal Yunis and Ayyal Ahmed lineages of the Habr Awal clan had held Berbera and jointly managed its trade, sharing in the profits on all commercial transactions as \u2018protectors\u2019 (abans) of foreign merchants from Arabia and India. When under the stimulus of developments at Aden the port\u2019s prosperity markedly increased, the numerically dominant Ayyal Yunis drove out their rival kinsmen and declared themselves commercial masters of Berbera. This led to a feud in which each side sought outside help; the defeated Ayyal Ahmed turned to Haji Shirmarke \u2018Ali and his Habr Yunis clansmen for support. With this backing, they were then able to re-establish themselves and to expel the Ayyal Yunis who moved to the small roadstead of Bulhar, some miles to the west of Berbera.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=I.M.|title= The Modern History of Somaliland: from Nation to State |date=1965|publisher=Praeger|pages=35|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nNot only did the Habr Awal host foreign merchants at their ports, they also conducted trade missions on their own vessels to the Arabian ports<ref>{{cite book|last1=Prichard|first1=J. C.|title= Researches Into the Physical History of Mankind: Ethnography of the African races.|date=1837|publisher= Sherwood, Gilbert & Piper|pages=160|language=english}}</ref>. The majority of the Somali merchants who frequented Aden and other Southern Arabian ports hailed from the Habr Awal clan. They procured various raw goods from Harar and the interior in exchange for manufactured goods. During their stay, the Habr Awal rented their own houses and hired their own servants, whereas other Somali clans tended to stay with relatives already established across the Gulf. \n\n<blockquote>Merchants. \u2014 These are generally members of the Habr Awal tribe. They bring from Harrar and the Galla country, coffee, saffron (bastard), tusks (ivory), and feathers, taking away in return zinc, brass, broad cloth, and piece goods. They remain in Aden for about twenty days at a time during the trading season, which lasts about nine months,' making four trips. During their residence they hire a house, and are accompanied by their own domestics.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Frederick|title=An Account of the British Settlement of Aden in Arabia|date=1877|publisher=Cengage Gale|pages=41|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the interior, Habr Awal trade caravans (khafilas) were a frequent sight according to contemporary European accounts of the Somali Peninsula:\n\n<blockquote>On leaving Hargeisa we travelled for many miles through beautiful park-like land, alive with birds and jungle fowl. We met the usual Somali khafilas [trading caravans] of Habr-Awal men, carrying their skins, gums, ghee, and coffee to our port at Bulhar, situated between Berbera and Zeila.<ref>'Twixt sirdar & Menelik: an account of a year's expedition from Zeila to Cairo, p. 18, 1901</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Somalis from the deep interior, principally those from the [[Ogaden (clan)|Ogaden]], also gained most of their resources from the Habr Awal merchants who they called \"iidoor\", an enviable pejorative meaning [[merchant]] or trader, a reference to the mercantile nature of the Habr Awal traders at the time.<ref name=\"Info\">Somali Poetry, Lewis & Adrzejewski, 1964, pp. 111\u2013115</ref> The coastal Habr Awal (mainly the Reer Ahmed Nuh) regularly acted as brokers/middlemen for the Somali clans of the interior who wished to take their goods to the ports of Berbera and Bulhar:\n\n<blockquote>The custom is for the Ayal Achmet (Berbera tribe) to act as brokers, and too often most of the profits stick to the hands of the middleman. Till lately no Ogadayn ever went to the coast, but entrusted the goods to coast traders.<ref>{{cite book|title= The Dublin Review, Volume 98|date=1886|pages=176|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===British Protectorate Period===\n\nThe Habr Awal clan came under the [[British Protectorate]] by signing a treaty with the [[British Empire]] on 14 July 1884. The Habr Awal continued to have a lucrative trading agreement with their foreign contacts, many of whom were also under British rule in their respective nations.

The SNM at 1981 founding in [[London]] it elected [[Ahmed Mohamed Gulaid]] from the Habr Awal clan as its first chairman, who stated that the group's explicit purpose was to overthrow the [[Siad Barre]] [[military regime]].<ref name=\"Metz\">Helen Chapin Metz, ''Somalia: a country study'', Volume 550, Issues 86-993, (The Division: 1993), p.xxviii.</ref> The SNM gathered its main base of support from members of the Isaaq clan, who formed and supported the movement in response to years of systematic discrimination by the Siad Barre government.\n\nMembers of the Habr Awal clan made up a significant portion of leaders and soldiers of the SNM.
