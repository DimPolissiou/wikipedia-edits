''Raisin Production Manual'', [[University of California]] at [[University of California, Davis|Davis]].</ref>\n\nThe three steps to commercial raisin production include pre-treatment, drying, and post-drying processes.<ref name=\"raisin processing\" />\n\n===Pre-treatment===\nPre-treatment is a necessary step in raisin production to ensure the increased rate of water removal during the drying process.<ref name=\"raisin processing\" /> A faster water removal rate decreases the rate of browning and helps to produce more desirable raisins.<ref name=\"raisin processing\" /> The historical method of completing this process was developed in the Mediterranean and Asia Minor areas by using a dry emulsion cold dip made of potassium carbonate and ethyl esters of fatty acids.<ref name=\"raisin production\" /> This dip was shown to increase the rate of water loss by two- to three-fold.<ref name=\"raisin production\" />\n\nRecently, new methods have been developed such as exposing the grapes to oil emulsions or dilute alkaline solutions. These methods can encourage water transfer to the outer surface of grapes which helps to increase the efficiency of the drying process.<ref name=\"raisin processing\" />\n\n===Drying===\n[[File:Chunche.jpg|thumb|''[[Chunche]]'', ventilated sheds for drying grapes into raisins in [[Xinjiang]]]]\nThe three types of drying methods are: sun drying, shade drying, and mechanical drying.<ref name=\"raisin processing\" />{{explain|date=February 2018}} Sun drying is an inexpensive process; however, environmental contamination, insect infections, and microbial deterioration can occur and the resulting raisins are often of low quality. Additionally, sun drying is a very slow process and may not produce the most desirable raisins.<ref name=\"raisin processing\" />\n\nMechanical drying can be done in a safer and more controlled environment where rapid drying is guaranteed. One type of mechanical drying is to use microwave heating. Water molecules in the grapes absorb microwave energy resulting in rapid evaporation. Microwave heating often produces puffy raisins.<ref name=\"raisin processing\" />\n\n===Post-drying processes===\n[[File:Taliparamba grocery.jpg|thumbnail|Raisins offered for sale at a market in [[Taliparamba]], India.]]\nAfter the drying process is complete, raisins are sent to processing plants where they are cleaned with water to remove any foreign objects that may have become embedded during the drying process.<ref name=\"raisin processing\" /> Stems and off-grade raisins are also removed. The washing process may cause rehydration, so another drying step is completed after washing to ensure that the added moisture has been removed.<ref name=\"raisin processing\" />\n\nAll steps in the production of raisins are very important in determining the quality of raisins. Sometimes, sulfur dioxide is applied to raisins after the pre treatment step and before drying to decrease the rate of browning caused by the reaction between polyphenol oxidase and phenolic compounds. Sulfur dioxide also helps to preserve flavor and prevent the loss of certain vitamins during the drying process.<ref name=\"raisin production\" />\n\n===Nutrition and health===\n[[File:Elaboraci\u00f3 de pansa a Gata de Gorgos (Museu Valenci\u00e0 d'Etnologia).webm|thumb|417x417px|Drying raisins at [[Gata de Gorgos]], Video by [[Valencian Museum of Ethnology]].]]\nRaisins are rich in [[dietary fiber]], carbohydrates with a low [[glycemic index]], and minerals like copper and iron, with a low fat content.

''Raisin Production Manual'', [[University of California]] at [[University of California, Davis|Davis]].</ref>\n\nThe three steps to commercial raisin production include pre-treatment, drying, and post-drying processes.<ref name=\"raisin processing\" />\n\n===Pre-treatment===\nPre-treatment is a necessary step in raisin production to ensure the increased rate of water removal during the drying process.<ref name=\"raisin processing\" /> A faster water removal rate decreases the rate of browning and helps to produce more desirable raisins.<ref name=\"raisin processing\" /> The historical method of completing this process was developed in the Mediterranean and Asia Minor areas by using a dry emulsion cold dip made of potassium carbonate and ethyl esters of fatty acids.<ref name=\"raisin production\" /> This dip was shown to increase the rate of water loss by two- to three-fold.<ref name=\"raisin production\" />\n\nRecently, new methods have been developed such as exposing the grapes to oil emulsions or dilute alkaline solutions. These methods can encourage water transfer to the outer surface of grapes which helps to increase the efficiency of the drying process.<ref name=\"raisin processing\" />\n\n===Drying===\n[[File:Chunche.jpg|thumb|''[[Chunche]]'', ventilated sheds for drying grapes into raisins in [[Xinjiang]]]]\nThe three types of drying methods are: sun drying, shade drying, and mechanical drying.<ref name=\"raisin processing\" />{{explain|date=February 2018}} Sun drying is an inexpensive process; however, environmental contamination, insect infections, and microbial deterioration can occur and the resulting raisins are often of low quality. Additionally, sun drying is a very slow process and may not produce the most desirable raisins.<ref name=\"raisin processing\" />\n\nMechanical drying can be done in a safer and more controlled environment where rapid drying is guaranteed. One type of mechanical drying is to use microwave heating. Water molecules in the grapes absorb microwave energy resulting in rapid evaporation. Microwave heating often produces puffy raisins.<ref name=\"raisin processing\" />\n\n===Post-drying processes===\n[[File:Taliparamba grocery.jpg|thumbnail|Raisins offered for sale at a market in [[Taliparamba]], India.]]\nAfter the drying process is complete, raisins are sent to processing plants where they are cleaned with water to remove any foreign objects that may have become embedded during the drying process.<ref name=\"raisin processing\" /> Stems and off-grade raisins are also removed. The washing process may cause rehydration, so another drying step is completed after washing to ensure that the added moisture has been removed.<ref name=\"raisin processing\" />\n\nAll steps in the production of raisins are very important in determining the quality of raisins. Sometimes, sulfur dioxide is applied to raisins after the pre treatment step and before drying to decrease the rate of browning caused by the reaction between polyphenol oxidase and phenolic compounds. Sulfur dioxide also helps to preserve flavor and prevent the loss of certain vitamins during the drying process.<ref name=\"raisin production\" />\n\n===Nutrition and health===\n[[File:Elaboraci\u00f3 de pansa a Gata de Gorgos (Museu Valenci\u00e0 d'Etnologia).webm|thumb|417x417px|Drying raisins at [[Gata de Gorgos]], Video by [[Valencian Museum of Ethnology]].]]\nRaisins are rich in [[dietary fiber]], carbohydrates with a low [[glycemic index]], and minerals like copper and iron, with a low fat content.

By  clicking, dragging, and pulling with the mouse, players may directly manipulate the facial features of a Sim. Players can directly manipulate any body part including the abdomen, chest, legs, arms and feet. In previous Sims games, only the fitness and fatness can be manipulated on a Sims body; however, fitness and fatness levels may still be adjusted in ''The Sims 4'' with sliders as in previous games. The base game comes with over 40 hairstyles for both men and women. There are up to 18 hair color options per hairstyle. Selections of premade designs of Sims are available to choose from, which range in body shape and ethnicity.\n\nSeven life stages are available including baby, toddler, child, teenager, young adult, adult and elder. The baby life stage is accessible only through the birth of a Sim and not available in Create A Sim.

Despite the praise, Lang awarded the game with two stars stating that he encountered annoying glitches and that he misses content from previous games, like dishwashers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/review-sims-aspires-greatness-fails-25226583|title=Entertainment News, Celebrity and Pop Culture - ABC News|author=ABC News|work=ABC News}}</ref>\n\nKevin VanOrd of [[GameSpot]] gave this game a 6 out of 10. Despite praising the visuals, audio, and the new multi-tasking and moods system, he states that he misses the two main features of ''The Sims 3'': \"Create-a-Style\" and the open world. His conclusion is: \"''The Sims 4''{{'}}s biggest problem is that ''The Sims 3'' exists\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-sims-4-review/1900-6415867/|title=The Sims 4 Review|author=Kevin VanOrd|work=GameSpot}}</ref>\n\nOther reviews were more favorable. [[CraveOnline]].co.uk mentioned in an article that \"the awful user reviews indicate a strong backlash;\" however, the website added that \"''Sims'' fans who haven't paid much attention to the ongoing controversy surrounding the game may look at those [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] review scores and, without knowing that many are immediately dismissing the game due to its cut content, decide that they won't purchase it.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.craveonline.co.uk/gaming/articles/753685-sims-4s-awful-user-reviews-indicate-strong-fan-backlash|title=The Sims 4's Awful User Reviews Indicate a Strong Fan Backlash - CraveOnline|work=CraveOnline}}</ref>\n\nKallie Plagge of [[IGN]] gave ''The Sims 4'' a 7.5 out of 10. She was disappointed by the lack of content from previous games, and the lack of \"cool\" objects that could adequately replace them; and the too frequent, albeit short, loading screens. The score she gave is relatively high, though, because \"''The Sims 4'' does succeed in being a deep and complex game when it comes to Sim interactions, with lots of entertaining emotional potential [...] Plus, excellent building tools make architecture more fun than ever\". Her conclusion is that \"it's a good start to what may eventually be expanded into a great Sims game, but it's not there yet\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/02/the-sims-4-review|title=The Sims 4 Review|work=IGN}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Independent]]''{{'}}s Jack Fleming praised the game for \"The Gallery\" feature that allows users to showcase their creations easily, the new multitasking system, the visual design, the personalities and emotions, the unusual careers (that, for example, allow the sim to travel into space), and the new build mode. On the other hand, he voiced his frustration with the loading screens, the new camera controls (while noting they can be reverted to ''The Sims 3'' style), and noted the lack of content from previous installments (such as swimming pools and toddlers) made many fans upset. In conclusion he writes: \"''The Sims 4'' is an easy game to get into (though the constant tutorial-ising at the start can actually get a bit frustrating) and the reasons that people love this series are still present. The game's creators have tried to make the appeal as diverse as possible and have in most ways succeeded; however, I couldn't help but wish I could actually go to space and drive that spaceship around...\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/gaming/the-sims-4-review-want-more-from-life-create-a-sim-9714109.html|title=The Sims 4 review: want more from life?

He explains that the reason for ''Sims'' fans expressing so much anger and dissatisfaction with it is because people \"strongly prefer avoiding losses than acquiring gains\". That, combined with the [[Criticism of Electronic Arts|hatred for Electronic Arts]] that greatly intensified after the release of the latest ''[[SimCity (2013 video game)|SimCity]]'' game, resulted in such a backlash. Tan gave ''The Sims 4'' a 3.5/5, calling it \"woefully incomplete, despite being unexpectedly solid and entertaining in its current state\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/the-sims-4|title=The Sims 4 Review|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website}}\n\n{{The Sims}}\n{{Sim series}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sims 4, The}}\n[[Category:2014 video games]]\n[[Category:Electronic Arts games]]\n[[Category:Life simulation games]]\n[[Category:MacOS games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation 4 games]]\n[[Category:Python-scripted video games]]\n[[Category:Single-player video games]]\n[[Category:Social simulation video games]]\n[[Category:The Sims]]\n[[Category:Video games featuring protagonists of selectable gender]]\n[[Category:Video games with downloadable content]]\n[[Category:Video games with custom soundtrack support]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Xbox One games]]\n[[Category:Video games with expansion packs]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United States]]\n[[Category:Ghost video games]]\n", "text_old": "{{pp-pc|small=yes}}\n{{short description|2014 video game}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=November 2018}}\n{{Infobox video game <!---Let's try not to toss sources into the infobox; if new news has came out, place it into the prose and source it there.--->\n| title = The Sims 4\n| image = The Sims 4 Box Art.png{{!}}border\n| caption = Original Box Art\n| developer = [[Maxis]]{{efn|Blind Squirrel Entertainment co-developed the PS4 and Xbox One versions}}\n| publisher = [[Electronic Arts]]\n| series = ''[[The Sims]]''\n| platforms = {{ubl|[[Microsoft Windows]]|[[macOS]]|[[PlayStation 4]]|[[Xbox One]]}}\n| released = '''Microsoft Windows'''{{Video game release|NA|September 2, 2014|AUS|September 4, 2014|EU|September 4, 2014|UK|September 5, 2014}}'''macOS'''{{Video game release|WW|February 17, 2015}}'''PlayStation 4, Xbox One'''{{Video game release|WW|November 14, 2017}}\n| genre = [[Simulation game|Simulation]]\n| modes = [[Single-player video game|Single-player]]\n| director = \n| producer = {{ubl|Kevin Gibson|Grant Rodiek|Ryan Michael Vaughan}}\n| designer = {{ubl|Eric Holmberg-Weidler|Matt Yang}}\n| programmer = \n| artist = {{ubl|Magnus Hollmo|Samantha Miceli|Steven Ross}}\n| writer = Danielle von Mayrhauser\n| composer = [[Ilan Eshkeri]]\n}}\n\n'''''The Sims 4''''' is a 2014 [[life simulation game|life simulation]] video game developed by the Redwood Shores studio of [[Maxis]] and published by [[Electronic Arts]].

By  clicking, dragging, and pulling with the mouse, players may directly manipulate the facial features of a Sim. Players can directly manipulate any body part including the abdomen, chest, legs, arms and feet. In previous Sims games, only the fitness and fatness can be manipulated on a Sims body; however, fitness and fatness levels may still be adjusted in ''The Sims 4'' with sliders as in previous games. The base game comes with over 40 hairstyles for both men and women. There are up to 18 hair color options per hairstyle. Selections of premade designs of Sims are available to choose from, which range in body shape and ethnicity.\n\nSeven life stages are available including baby, toddler, child, teenager, young adult, adult and elder. The baby life stage is accessible only through the birth of a Sim and not available in Create A Sim.

There is a filter panel where clothing options can be sorted by color, material, outfit category, fashion choice, style, content and packs.\n\nIn a summer 2016 update, gender options were expanded in the game, allowing any gender expression.

She was disappointed by the lack of content from previous games, and the lack of \"cool\" objects that could adequately replace them; and the too frequent, albeit short, loading screens. The score she gave is relatively high, though, because \"''The Sims 4'' does succeed in being a deep and complex game when it comes to Sim interactions, with lots of entertaining emotional potential [...] Plus, excellent building tools make architecture more fun than ever\". Her conclusion is that \"it's a good start to what may eventually be expanded into a great Sims game, but it's not there yet\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/02/the-sims-4-review|title=The Sims 4 Review|work=IGN}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Independent]]''{{'}}s Jack Fleming praised the game for \"The Gallery\" feature that allows users to showcase their creations easily, the new multitasking system, the visual design, the personalities and emotions, the unusual careers (that, for example, allow the sim to travel into space), and the new build mode. On the other hand, he voiced his frustration with the loading screens, the new camera controls (while noting they can be reverted to ''The Sims 3'' style), and noted the lack of content from previous installments (such as swimming pools and toddlers) made many fans upset. In conclusion he writes: \"''The Sims 4'' is an easy game to get into (though the constant tutorial-ising at the start can actually get a bit frustrating) and the reasons that people love this series are still present. The game's creators have tried to make the appeal as diverse as possible and have in most ways succeeded; however, I couldn't help but wish I could actually go to space and drive that spaceship around...\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/gaming/the-sims-4-review-want-more-from-life-create-a-sim-9714109.html|title=The Sims 4 review: want more from life?

He explains that the reason for ''Sims'' fans expressing so much anger and dissatisfaction with it is because people \"strongly prefer avoiding losses than acquiring gains\". That, combined with the [[Criticism of Electronic Arts|hatred for Electronic Arts]] that greatly intensified after the release of the latest ''[[SimCity (2013 video game)|SimCity]]'' game, resulted in such a backlash.

{"title_page": "Categorical imperative", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2015}}\n{{Immanuel Kant}}\n\nThe '''categorical imperative''' ({{lang-de|kategorischer Imperativ}}) is the central [[philosophy|philosophical]] concept in the [[deontological]] [[Moral philosophy#Deontology|moral philosophy]] of [[Immanuel Kant]].  Introduced in Kant's 1785 ''[[Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals]]'', it may be defined as a way of evaluating [[motivation]]s for action.\n\nAccording to Kant, sentient beings occupy a special place in creation, and morality can be summed up in an imperative, or ultimate commandment of reason, from which all duties and obligations derive.  He defined an imperative as any proposition declaring a certain action (or inaction) to be necessary.\n\n[[Hypothetical imperative]]s apply to someone who wishes to attain certain ends. For example:\n* I must drink something to quench my thirst\n* I must study to pass this exam.\nA categorical imperative, on the other hand, denotes an absolute, unconditional requirement that must be obeyed in all circumstances and is justified as an end in itself.  It is best known in its first formulation:\n\n:'''Act only according to that [[maxim (philosophy)|maxim]] whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law.'''<ref name=\"Ellington\">{{cite book |last=Kant |first=Immanuel |translator-first=James W. |translator-last=Ellington |orig-year=1785 |title=Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals |edition=3rd |publisher=Hackett |year=1993 |page=[https://archive.org/details/groundingformet000kant/page/30 30] |isbn=0-87220-166-X |ref=harv |url=https://archive.org/details/groundingformet000kant |url-access=registration }}. It is standard to also reference the ''Akademie Ausgabe'' of Kant's works. The ''Groundwork'' occurs in the fourth volume. Citations throughout this article follow the format 4:x. For example, the above citation is taken from 4:421.</ref>\n\nKant expressed extreme dissatisfaction with the popular moral philosophy of his day, believing that it could never surpass the level of hypothetical imperatives: a [[utilitarian]] says that murder is wrong because it does not maximize good for those involved, but this is irrelevant to people who are concerned only with maximizing the positive outcome for themselves.  Consequently, Kant argued, hypothetical moral systems cannot persuade moral action or be regarded as bases for moral judgments against others, because the imperatives on which they are based rely too heavily on subjective considerations.  He presented a [[deontological]] moral system, based on the demands of the categorical imperative, as an alternative.\n\n== Nature of the concept ==\n\nThe capacity that underlies deciding what is moral is called [[pure practical reason]], which is contrasted with [[pure reason]] (the capacity to know without having been shown) and mere [[practical reason]] (which allows us to interact with the world in experience). [[Hypothetical imperative]]s tell us which means best achieve our ends.  They do not, however, tell us which ends we should choose.  The typical dichotomy in choosing ends is between ends that are \"right\" (e.g., helping someone) and those that are \"good\" (e.g., enriching oneself).  Kant considered the \"right\" superior to the \"good\"; to him, the \"good\" was morally irrelevant.  In Kant's view, a person cannot decide whether conduct is \"right,\" or moral, through empirical means.  Such judgments must be reached [[a priori knowledge|''a priori'']], using pure practical reason.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nThe categorical imperative is universally reasoning what action is moral separate from observable experience. The distinction, it is imperative each action is not empirically reasoned by observable experience, has had wide social impact in the legal and political concepts of [[human rights]] and [[social equality|equality]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n=== How is a Categorical Imperative possible? ===\n\nWe see ourselves as belonging to both the world of understanding and the world of sense. As a member of the world of understanding, a person's actions would always conform to the autonomy of the will. As a part of the world of sense, he would necessarily fall under the natural law of desires and inclinations. However, since the world of understanding contains the ground of the world of sense and so too of its laws, his actions ought to conform to the autonomy of the will, and this categorical \"ought\" represents a synthetic proposition ''a priori''.<ref>4:454</ref> \n\n=== Freedom and autonomy ===\nKant viewed the human individual as a rationally self-conscious being with \"impure\" freedom of choice:\n\n{{quote|text=The faculty of desire in accordance with concepts, in-so-far as the ground determining it to action lies within itself and not in its object, is called a faculty to \"do or to refrain from doing as one pleases\".  Insofar as it is joined with one's consciousness of the ability to bring about its object by one's action it is called ''choice'' (Willk\u00fcr); if it is not joined with this consciousness its act is called a ''wish''.  The faculty of desire whose inner determining ground, hence even what pleases it, lies within the subject's reason is called the ''will'' (Wille).  The will is therefore the faculty of desire considered not so much in relation to action (as choice is) but rather in relation to the ground determining choice in action.  The will itself, strictly speaking, has no determining ground; insofar as it can determine choice, it is instead practical reason itself.\n\nInsofar as reason can determine the faculty of desire as such, not only ''choice'' but also mere ''wish'' can be included under the will.  That choice which can be determined by ''pure reason'' is called free choice.  That which can be determined only by ''inclination'' (sensible impulse, ''stimulus'') would be animal choice (''arbitrium brutum'').  Human choice, however, is a choice that can indeed be ''affected'' but not ''determined'' by impulses, and is therefore of itself (apart from an acquired proficiency of reason) not pure but can still be determined to actions by pure will. |author=Immanuel Kant |source=Metaphysics of Morals, 6:213\u20134}}\n\nFor a will to be considered \"free\", we must understand it as capable of affecting causal power without being caused to do so. But the idea of lawless [[free will]], that is, a will acting without any causal structure, is incomprehensible. Therefore, a free will must be acting under laws that it gives to ''itself''.\n\nAlthough Kant conceded that there could be no conceivable example of free will, because any example would only show us a will as it ''appears'' to us\u2014as a subject of natural laws\u2014he nevertheless argued against [[determinism]]. He proposed that determinism is logically inconsistent: the determinist claims that because ''A'' caused ''B'', and ''B'' caused ''C'', that ''A'' is the true cause of ''C''. Applied to a case of the human will, a determinist would argue that the will does not have causal power and that something outside the will causes the will to act as it does. But this argument merely assumes what it sets out to prove: viz. that the human will is part of the causal chain.\n\nSecondly, Kant remarks that free will is ''inherently unknowable''. Since even a free person could not possibly have knowledge of their own freedom, we cannot use our failure to find a proof for freedom as evidence for a lack of it. The observable world could never contain an example of freedom because it would never show us a will as it appears to ''itself'', but only a will that is subject to natural laws imposed on it. But we do appear to ourselves as free.  Therefore, he argued for the idea of transcendental freedom\u2014that is, freedom as a presupposition of the question \"what ''ought'' I to do?\" This is what gives us sufficient basis for ascribing moral responsibility: the rational and self-actualizing power of a person, which he calls moral [[autonomy]]: \"the property the will has of being a law unto itself.\"\n\n==The first formulation: formula of universality and the law of nature==\n<div style=\"font-size:115%\">\n{{rquote|right|Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.|Immanuel Kant|''Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals''<ref name=\"Ellington\"/>}}</div>\nFrom this step, Kant concludes that a moral proposition that is true must be one that is not tied to any particular conditions, including the identity and desires of the person making the moral deliberation. A moral maxim must imply absolute necessity, which is to say that it must be disconnected from the particular physical details surrounding the proposition, and could be applied to any rational being. This leads to the first formulation of the categorical imperative, sometimes called the \"universalizability principle\":<ref>e.g. T. N. Pelegrinis, ''Kant's Conceptions of the Categorical Imperative and the Will'' (1980), p. 92</ref>\n\n*\"Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.\"<ref name=\"Ellington\"/>\n\nClosely connected with this formulation is the law of nature formulation. Because laws of nature are by definition universal, Kant claims we may also express the categorical imperative as:\n\n*\"Act as if the maxims of your action were to become through your will a '''universal law of nature'''.\"<ref name=\"4:421\">4:421</ref>\n\nKant divides the duties imposed by this formulation into two sets of two subsets. The first division is between duties we have to ourselves versus duties we have to others.<ref name=\"4:421\"/> For example, we have an obligation not to kill ourselves as well as an obligation not to kill others. Kant also, however, introduces a distinction between \"perfect\" and \"imperfect\" duties,<ref name=\"4:421\"/> which requires more explanation:\n\n===Perfect duty===\nAccording to his reasoning, we first have a perfect duty not to act by maxims that result in logical contradictions when we attempt to universalize them. The moral proposition ''A'': \"It is permissible to steal\" would result in a contradiction upon universalisation. The notion of stealing presupposes the existence of personal property, but were ''A'' universalized, then there could be no personal property, and so the proposition has logically negated itself.\n\nIn general, perfect duties are those that are blameworthy if not met, as they are a basic required duty for a human being.\n\n===Imperfect duty===\nSecond, we have imperfect duties, which are still based on pure reason, but which allow for desires in how they are carried out in practice. Because these depend somewhat on the subjective preferences of humankind, this duty is not as strong as a perfect duty, but it is still morally binding. As such, unlike perfect duties, you do not attract blame should you not complete an imperfect duty but you shall receive praise for it should you complete it, as you have gone beyond the basic duties and taken duty upon yourself.\nImperfect duties are circumstantial, meaning simply that you could not reasonably exist in a constant state of performing that duty.  This is what truly differentiates between perfect and imperfect duties, because imperfect duties are those duties that are never truly completed.  A particular example provided by Kant is the imperfect duty to cultivate one's own talents.<ref>4:423</ref>\n\n==The second formulation: the formula of humanity==\n<div style=\"font-size:115%\">\n<br />{{rquote|right|Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end.|Immanuel Kant|''Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals''<ref>{{harvnb|Kant|1993|page=36}}. 4:429.</ref>}}</div>\n\nEvery rational action must set before itself not only a principle, but also an end. Most ends are of a subjective kind, because they need only be pursued if they are in line with some particular hypothetical imperative that a person may choose to adopt. For an end to be objective, it would be necessary that we categorically pursue it.\n\nThe free will is the source of all rational action. But to treat it as a subjective end is to deny the possibility of freedom in general. Because the autonomous will is the one and only source of moral action, it would contradict the first formulation to claim that a person is merely a means to some other end, rather than always an end in themselves.\n\nOn this basis, Kant derives the second formulation of the categorical imperative from the first.\n\nBy combining this formulation with the first, we learn that a person has ''perfect duty'' not to use the humanity of themselves or others merely as a means to some other end. As a [[slavery|slave owner]] would be effectively asserting a moral right to own a person as a slave, they would be asserting a property right in another person. This would violate the categorical imperative, because it denies the basis for there to be free rational action at all; it denies the status of a person as an end in themselves. One cannot, on Kant's account, ever suppose a right to treat another person as a mere means to an end. In the case of a slave owner, the slaves are being used to cultivate the owner's fields (the slaves acting as the means) to ensure a sufficient harvest (the end goal of the owner).\n\nThe second formulation also leads to the ''imperfect duty'' to further the ends of ourselves and others. If any person desires perfection in themselves or others, it would be their moral duty to seek that end for all people equally, so long as that end does not contradict perfect duty.\n\n==The third formulation: the formula of autonomy==\n<div style=\"font-size:115%\">\n{{rquote|right|Thus the third practical principle follows [from the first two] as the ultimate condition of their harmony with practical reason: the idea of ''the will of every rational being as a universally legislating will''.|Immanuel Kant|''Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals''<ref>{{harvnb|Kant|1993|page=43}}. 4:431</ref>}}</div>\n\nKant claims that the first formulation lays out the ''objective'' conditions on the categorical imperative: that it be universal in form and thus capable of becoming a law of nature. Likewise, the second formulation lays out ''subjective'' conditions: that there be certain ends in themselves, namely rational beings as such.<ref>4:431</ref> The result of these two considerations is that we must will maxims that can be at the same time universal, but which do not infringe on the freedom of ourselves nor of others. A universal maxim, however, could only have this form if it were a maxim that each subject by himself endorsed. Because it cannot be something which externally constrains each subject's activity, it must be a constraint that each subject has set for himself. This leads to the concept of ''self''-legislation. Each subject must through his own use of reason will maxims which have the form of universality, but do not impinge on the freedom of others: thus each subject must will maxims that could be universally self-legislated.\n\nThe result, of course, is a formulation of the categorical imperative that contains much of the same as the first two. We must will something that we could at the same time freely will of ourselves. After introducing this third formulation, Kant introduces a distinction between ''[[autonomy]]'' (literally: self-law-giving) and ''[[heteronomy]]'' (literally: other-law-giving). This third formulation makes it clear that the categorical imperative requires autonomy. It is not enough that the right conduct be followed, but that one also demands that conduct of oneself.\n\n==Other formulations==\n\nIn the ''Groundwork'', Kant goes on to formulate the categorical imperative in a number of different ways following the first three; however, because Kant himself claims that there are only three principles,<ref>4:431\u20132; 4:435\u20136</ref> little attention has been given to these other formulations. Moreover, they are often easily assimilated to the first three formulations, as Kant takes himself to be explicitly summarizing these earlier principles.<ref>These additional formulations, of which there are at least eight, can be seen at: 4:434 (1); 4:436\u20137 (1); 4:437 (4); 4:438 (1); 4:438\u20139 (1).</ref>\n\nThere is, however, one additional formulation that has received a lot of additional attention because it appears to introduce a social dimension into Kant's thought. This is the formulation of the \"Kingdom of Ends\":\n\n===The Kingdom of Ends formulation===\n<div style=\"font-size:115%\">\n{{rquote|right|Act according to maxims of a universally legislating member of a merely possible kingdom of ends.|Immanuel Kant|''Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals''<ref name=Kant43>{{harvnb|Kant|1993|page=44}}. 4:439</ref>}}</div>\n\nBecause a truly autonomous will would not be subjugated to any interest, it would only be subject to those laws it makes for itself\u2014but it must also regard those laws as if they would be bound to others, or they would not be universalizable, and hence they would not be laws of conduct at all. Thus Kant presents the notion of the hypothetical [[Kingdom of Ends]] of which he suggests all people should consider themselves never solely as means but always as ends.\n\nWe ought to act only by maxims that would harmonize with a possible kingdom of ends. We have ''perfect duty'' not to act by maxims that create incoherent or impossible states of natural affairs when we attempt to universalize them, and we have ''imperfect duty'' not to act by maxims that lead to unstable or greatly undesirable states of affairs.\n\n==Application==\n\nAlthough Kant was intensely critical of the use of examples as moral yardsticks, because they tend to rely on our moral intuitions (feelings) rather than our rational powers, this section will explore some applications of the categorical imperative for illustrative purposes.\n\n===Deception===\n{{Further|Doctrine of mental reservation}}\nKant asserted that lying, or deception of any kind, would be forbidden under any interpretation and in any circumstance. In the ''Groundwork'', Kant gives the example of a person who seeks to borrow money without intending to pay it back. This is a contradiction because if it were a universal action, no person would lend money anymore as he knows that he will never be paid back.  The maxim of this action, says Kant, results in a {{clarify span|contradiction in conceivability|date=May 2019}} (and thus contradicts perfect duty).  With lying, it would logically contradict the reliability of language. If it were universally acceptable to lie, then no one would believe anyone and all truths would be assumed to be lies.  In each case, the proposed action becomes inconceivable in a world where the maxim exists as law.  In a world where no one would lend money, seeking to borrow money in the manner originally imagined is inconceivable.  In a world where no one trusts one another, the same is true about manipulative lies.\n\nThe right to deceive could also not be claimed because it would deny the status of the person deceived as an end in itself. The theft would be incompatible with a possible kingdom of ends. Therefore, Kant denied the right to lie or deceive for any reason, regardless of context or anticipated consequences.\n\n===Theft===\nKant argued that any action taken against another person to which he or she ''could not possibly'' consent is a violation of perfect duty interpreted through the second formulation. If a thief were to steal a book from an unknowing victim, it may have been that the victim would have agreed, had the thief simply asked. However, no person can consent to theft, because the presence of consent would mean that the transfer was not a theft. Because the victim could not have consented to the action, it could not be instituted as a universal law of nature, and theft contradicts perfect duty.\n\n===Suicide===\nKant applied his categorical imperative to the issue of suicide motivated by a sickness of life in ''The Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals'',{{sfn|Kant|1993|pp=30\u201331}} writing that:\n\n{{quote |text=A man reduced to despair by a series of misfortunes feels sick of life, but is still so far in possession of his reason that he can ask himself whether taking his own life would not be contrary to his duty to himself. Now he asks whether the maxim of his action could become a universal law of nature. But his maxim is this:  from self-love I make as my principle to shorten my life when its continued duration threatens more evil than it promises satisfaction. There only remains the question as to whether this principle of self-love can become a universal law of nature.  One sees at once that a contradiction in a system of nature whose law would destroy life by means of the very same feeling that acts so as to stimulate the furtherance of life, and hence there could be no existence as a system of nature. Therefore, such a maxim cannot possibly hold as a universal law of nature and is, consequently, wholly opposed to the supreme principle of all duty. |author=Immanuel Kant |source=''Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals''{{sfn|Kant|1993|pp=30\u201331}} }}\n\nHow the Categorical Imperative would apply to suicide from other motivations is unclear.\n\n===Laziness===\nKant also applies the categorical imperative in ''The Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals'' on the subject of \"failing to cultivate one's talents.\" He proposes a man who if he cultivated his talents could bring many goods, but he has everything he wants and would prefer to enjoy the pleasures of life instead.  The man asks himself how the universality of such a thing works.  While Kant agrees that a society could subsist if everyone did nothing, he notes that the man would have no pleasures to enjoy, for if everyone let their talents go to waste, there would be no one to create luxuries that created this theoretical situation in the first place.  Not only that, but cultivating one's talents is a duty to oneself.  Thus, it is not willed to make laziness universal, and a rational being has imperfect duty to cultivate its talents.  Kant concludes in The Groundwork:\n\n{{quote |text=...he cannot possibly will that this should become a universal law of nature or be implanted in us as such a law by a natural instinct.  For as a rational being he necessarily wills that all his faculties should be developed, inasmuch as they are given him for all sorts of possible purposes.<ref>{{harvnb|Kant|1993|p=31}}</ref>}}\n\n===Charity===\nKant's last application of the categorical imperative in ''The Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals'' is of charity. He proposes a fourth man who finds his own life fine but sees other people struggling with life and who ponders the outcome of doing nothing to help those in need (while not envying them or accepting anything from them). While Kant admits that humanity could subsist (and admits it could possibly perform better) if this were universal, he states in ''Grounding'':\n\n{{quote |text=But even though it is possible that a universal law of nature could subsist in accordance with that maxim, still it is impossible to will that such a principle should hold everywhere as a law of nature.  For a will that resolved in this way would contradict itself, inasmuch as cases might often arise in which one would have need of the love and sympathy of others and in which he would deprive himself, by such a law of nature springing from his own will, of all hope of the aid he wants for himself.<ref>{{harvnb|Kant|1993|p=32}}</ref>}}\n\n===Cruelty to animals===\nKant derived a prohibition against [[cruelty to animals]] by arguing that such cruelty is a violation of a duty in relation to oneself. According to Kant, man has the imperfect duty to strengthen the feeling of compassion, since this feeling promotes morality in relation to other human beings. However, cruelty to animals deadens the feeling of compassion in man. Therefore, man is obliged not to treat animals brutally (Kant, Metaphysics of Morals, \u00a7 17).\n\n== Criticisms ==\n\n===The Golden Rule===\n\nThe first formulation of the categorical imperative appears similar to [[Ethic of reciprocity|the Golden Rule]]. In its negative form, the rule prescribes: \"Do not impose on others what you do not wish for yourself.\"<ref>Confucius: The Golden Rule by Russel Freedman</ref> In its positive form, the rule states: \"Treat others how you wish to be treated\".<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia  |title=golden rule|editor =[[Antony Flew]] | encyclopedia=A Dictionary of Philosophy |publisher = [[Pan Books]] in association with [[Macmillan Publishers|The MacMillan Press]]   | year = 1979   | location = London | page = 134 | isbn=0-330-48730-2}}</ref> Due to this similarity, some have thought the two are identical.<ref>\"This is indeed the well-known \u201cGolden Rule\u201d that we find in the teachings of Moses, and Confucius, and Jesus, and many others. I think, however, that all three of them would say that the most universal moral rule is even more universal than this one: something like \"Do good and not evil.\" Kreeft, Peter (2009). ''Socrates Meets Kant'' p. 234. Ignatius Press. Kindle Edition.{{ISBN?}}</ref>\n\n[[Peter Corning]] suggests that, \"Kant's objection to the Golden Rule is especially suspect because the categorical imperative (CI) sounds a lot like a paraphrase, or perhaps a close cousin, of the same fundamental idea. In effect, it says that you should act toward others in ways that you would want everyone else to act toward others, yourself included (presumably). Calling it a universal law does not materially improve on the basic concept.\"<ref>\"The Fair Society\"</ref> Corning claims that Ken Binmore thought so as well.\n\nKant himself did not think so in the ''[[Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals|Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals]].'' Rather, the categorical imperative is an attempt to identify ''a purely formal'' and necessarily universally binding rule on all rational agents. The Golden Rule, on the other hand, is neither purely formal nor necessarily universally binding. It is \"empirical\" in the sense that applying it depends on providing content, such as, \"If you don't want others to hit you, then don't hit them.\" It is also a hypothetical imperative in the sense that it can be formulated, \"If you want X done to you, then do X to others.\" Kant feared that the hypothetical clause, \"if you want X done to you,\" remains open to dispute.<ref>Kreeft, Peter (2009). ''Socrates Meets Kant'' p. 236. Ignatius</ref>\n\n===Lying to a murderer===\nOne of the first major challenges to Kant's reasoning came from the [[France|French]] philosopher [[Benjamin Constant]], who asserted that since truth telling must be universal, according to Kant's theories, one must (if asked) tell a known murderer the location of his prey. This challenge occurred while Kant was still alive, and his response was the essay ''On a Supposed Right to Tell Lies from Benevolent Motives'' (sometimes translated ''On a Supposed Right to Lie because of Philanthropic Concerns''). In this reply, Kant agreed with Constant's inference, that from Kant's premises one must infer a moral duty not to lie to a murderer.\n\nKant denied that such an inference indicates any weakness in his premises: not lying to the murderer is required because moral actions do not derive their worth from the expected consequences. He claimed that because lying to the murderer would treat him as a mere means to another end, the lie denies the rationality of another person, and therefore denies the possibility of there being free rational action at all. This lie results in a {{clarify span|text=contradiction in conception|date=May 2019}} and therefore the lie is in conflict with duty.\n\nConstant and Kant agree that ''refusing to answer'' the murderer's question (rather than ''lying'') is consistent with the categorical imperative, but assume for the purposes of argument that refusing to answer would not be an option.\n\n===Questioning autonomy===\n[[Schopenhauer's criticism of Kantian philosophy#Categorical Imperative|Schopenhauer's criticism of the Kantian philosophy]] expresses doubt concerning the absence of [[egoism]] in the categorical imperative. [[Schopenhauer]] claimed that the categorical imperative is actually [[hypothetical]] and egotistical, not categorical.\n\n[[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]] believed Kantian autonomy was insufficient and that, if unchecked, people tend to be lenient in their own case, either by not exercising the full rigor of the moral law or by not properly disciplining themselves of moral transgressions:\n\n{{quote |text=Kant was of the opinion that man is his own law (autonomy)\u2014that is, he binds himself under the law which he himself gives himself.

Now if a man is never even once willing in his lifetime to act so decisively that [a lawgiver] can get hold of him, well, then it happens, then the man is allowed to live on in self-complacent illusion and make-believe and experimentation, but this also means: utterly without grace. |source=''Papers and Journals''<ref name=\"Kierkegaard\">{{cite book |last=Green |first=Ronald | title=Kierkegaard and Kant: The Hidden Debt |publisher=SUNY Press |year=1992 |pages=90\u201391}}</ref>}}\n\n== Application ==\n\n=== The trial of Adolf Eichmann ===\nIn 1961, discussion of Kant's categorical imperative was even included in the trial of the [[SS]] Lieutenant Colonel [[Adolf Eichmann]] in [[Jerusalem]].\n\nAs [[Hannah Arendt]] wrote in her book on the trial, Eichmann declared \"with great emphasis that he had lived his whole life ... according to a Kantian definition of duty\".

Introduced in Kant's 1785 ''[[Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals]]'', it may be defined as a way of evaluating [[motivation]]s for action.\n\nAccording to Kant, sentient beings occupy a special place in creation, and morality can be summed up in an imperative, or ultimate commandment of reason, from which all duties and obligations derive.  He defined an imperative as any proposition declaring a certain action (or inaction) to be necessary.\n\n[[Hypothetical imperative]]s apply to someone who wishes to attain certain ends. For example:\n* I must drink something to quench my thirst\n* I must study to pass this exam.\nA categorical imperative, on the other hand, denotes an absolute, unconditional requirement that must be obeyed in all circumstances and is justified as an end in itself.  It is best known in its first formulation:\n\n:'''Act only according to that [[maxim (philosophy)|maxim]] whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law.'''<ref name=\"Ellington\">{{cite book |last=Kant |first=Immanuel |translator-first=James W. |translator-last=Ellington |orig-year=1785 |title=Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals |edition=3rd |publisher=Hackett |year=1993 |page=[https://archive.org/details/groundingformet000kant/page/30 30] |isbn=0-87220-166-X |ref=harv |url=https://archive.org/details/groundingformet000kant |url-access=registration }}.

For example, the above citation is taken from 4:421.</ref>\n\nKant expressed extreme dissatisfaction with the popular moral philosophy of his day, believing that it could never surpass the level of hypothetical imperatives: a [[utilitarian]] says that murder is wrong because it does not maximize good for those involved, but this is irrelevant to people who are concerned only with maximizing the positive outcome for themselves.  Consequently, Kant argued, hypothetical moral systems cannot persuade moral action or be regarded as bases for moral judgments against others, because the imperatives on which they are based rely too heavily on subjective considerations.  He presented a [[deontological]] moral system, based on the demands of the categorical imperative, as an alternative.\n\n== Nature of the concept ==\n\nThe capacity that underlies deciding what is moral is called [[pure practical reason]], which is contrasted with [[pure reason]] (the capacity to know without having been shown) and mere [[practical reason]] (which allows us to interact with the world in experience). [[Hypothetical imperative]]s tell us which means best achieve our ends.  They do not, however, tell us which ends we should choose.  The typical dichotomy in choosing ends is between ends that are \"right\" (e.g., helping someone) and those that are \"good\" (e.g., enriching oneself).  Kant considered the \"right\" superior to the \"good\"; to him, the \"good\" was morally irrelevant.  In Kant's view, a person cannot decide whether conduct is \"right,\" or moral, through empirical means.  Such judgments must be reached [[a priori knowledge|''a priori'']], using pure practical reason.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nThe categorical imperative is universally reasoning what action is moral separate from observable experience. The distinction, it is imperative each action is not empirically reasoned by observable experience, has had wide social impact in the legal and political concepts of [[human rights]] and [[social equality|equality]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n=== How is a Categorical Imperative possible? ===\n\nWe see ourselves as belonging to both the world of understanding and the world of sense. As a member of the world of understanding, a person's actions would always conform to the autonomy of the will. As a part of the world of sense, he would necessarily fall under the natural law of desires and inclinations. However, since the world of understanding contains the ground of the world of sense and so too of its laws, his actions ought to conform to the autonomy of the will, and this categorical \"ought\" represents a synthetic proposition ''a priori''.<ref>4:454</ref> \n\n=== Freedom and autonomy ===\nKant viewed the human individual as a rationally self-conscious being with \"impure\" freedom of choice:\n\n{{quote|text=The faculty of desire in accordance with concepts, in-so-far as the ground determining it to action lies within itself and not in its object, is called a faculty to \"do or to refrain from doing as one pleases\".  Insofar as it is joined with one's consciousness of the ability to bring about its object by one's action it is called ''choice'' (Willk\u00fcr); if it is not joined with this consciousness its act is called a ''wish''.  The faculty of desire whose inner determining ground, hence even what pleases it, lies within the subject's reason is called the ''will'' (Wille).  The will is therefore the faculty of desire considered not so much in relation to action (as choice is) but rather in relation to the ground determining choice in action.  The will itself, strictly speaking, has no determining ground; insofar as it can determine choice, it is instead practical reason itself.\n\nInsofar as reason can determine the faculty of desire as such, not only ''choice'' but also mere ''wish'' can be included under the will.  That choice which can be determined by ''pure reason'' is called free choice.  That which can be determined only by ''inclination'' (sensible impulse, ''stimulus'') would be animal choice (''arbitrium brutum'').  Human choice, however, is a choice that can indeed be ''affected'' but not ''determined'' by impulses, and is therefore of itself (apart from an acquired proficiency of reason) not pure but can still be determined to actions by pure will. |author=Immanuel Kant |source=Metaphysics of Morals, 6:213\u20134}}\n\nFor a will to be considered \"free\", we must understand it as capable of affecting causal power without being caused to do so. But the idea of lawless [[free will]], that is, a will acting without any causal structure, is incomprehensible. Therefore, a free will must be acting under laws that it gives to ''itself''.\n\nAlthough Kant conceded that there could be no conceivable example of free will, because any example would only show us a will as it ''appears'' to us\u2014as a subject of natural laws\u2014he nevertheless argued against [[determinism]]. He proposed that determinism is logically inconsistent: the determinist claims that because ''A'' caused ''B'', and ''B'' caused ''C'', that ''A'' is the true cause of ''C''. Applied to a case of the human will, a determinist would argue that the will does not have causal power and that something outside the will causes the will to act as it does. But this argument merely assumes what it sets out to prove: viz. that the human will is part of the causal chain.\n\nSecondly, Kant remarks that free will is ''inherently unknowable''. Since even a free person could not possibly have knowledge of their own freedom, we cannot use our failure to find a proof for freedom as evidence for a lack of it. The observable world could never contain an example of freedom because it would never show us a will as it appears to ''itself'', but only a will that is subject to natural laws imposed on it. But we do appear to ourselves as free.  Therefore, he argued for the idea of transcendental freedom\u2014that is, freedom as a presupposition of the question \"what ''ought'' I to do?\" This is what gives us sufficient basis for ascribing moral responsibility: the rational and self-actualizing power of a person, which he calls moral [[autonomy]]: \"the property the will has of being a law unto itself.\"\n\n==The first formulation: formula of universality and the law of nature==\n<div style=\"font-size:115%\">\n{{rquote|right|Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.|Immanuel Kant|''Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals''<ref name=\"Ellington\"/>}}</div>\nFrom this step, Kant concludes that a moral proposition that is true must be one that is not tied to any particular conditions, including the identity and desires of the person making the moral deliberation. A moral maxim must imply absolute necessity, which is to say that it must be disconnected from the particular physical details surrounding the proposition, and could be applied to any rational being. This leads to the first formulation of the categorical imperative, sometimes called the \"universalizability principle\":<ref>e.g. T. N. Pelegrinis, ''Kant's Conceptions of the Categorical Imperative and the Will'' (1980), p. 92</ref>\n\n*\"Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.\"<ref name=\"Ellington\"/>\n\nClosely connected with this formulation is the law of nature formulation. Because laws of nature are by definition universal, Kant claims we may also express the categorical imperative as:\n\n*\"Act as if the maxims of your action were to become through your will a '''universal law of nature'''.\"<ref name=\"4:421\">4:421</ref>\n\nKant divides the duties imposed by this formulation into two sets of two subsets. The first division is between duties we have to ourselves versus duties we have to others.<ref name=\"4:421\"/> For example, we have an obligation not to kill ourselves as well as an obligation not to kill others. Kant also, however, introduces a distinction between \"perfect\" and \"imperfect\" duties,<ref name=\"4:421\"/> which requires more explanation:\n\n===Perfect duty===\nAccording to his reasoning, we first have a perfect duty not to act by maxims that result in logical contradictions when we attempt to universalize them. The moral proposition ''A'': \"It is permissible to steal\" would result in a contradiction upon universalisation. The notion of stealing presupposes the existence of personal property, but were ''A'' universalized, then there could be no personal property, and so the proposition has logically negated itself.\n\nIn general, perfect duties are those that are blameworthy if not met, as they are a basic required duty for a human being.\n\n===Imperfect duty===\nSecond, we have imperfect duties, which are still based on pure reason, but which allow for desires in how they are carried out in practice. Because these depend somewhat on the subjective preferences of humankind, this duty is not as strong as a perfect duty, but it is still morally binding. As such, unlike perfect duties, you do not attract blame should you not complete an imperfect duty but you shall receive praise for it should you complete it, as you have gone beyond the basic duties and taken duty upon yourself.\nImperfect duties are circumstantial, meaning simply that you could not reasonably exist in a constant state of performing that duty.  This is what truly differentiates between perfect and imperfect duties, because imperfect duties are those duties that are never truly completed.  A particular example provided by Kant is the imperfect duty to cultivate one's own talents.<ref>4:423</ref>\n\n==The second formulation: the formula of humanity==\n<div style=\"font-size:115%\">\n<br />{{rquote|right|Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end.|Immanuel Kant|''Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals''<ref>{{harvnb|Kant|1993|page=36}}. 4:429.</ref>}}</div>\n\nEvery rational action must set before itself not only a principle, but also an end. Most ends are of a subjective kind, because they need only be pursued if they are in line with some particular hypothetical imperative that a person may choose to adopt. For an end to be objective, it would be necessary that we categorically pursue it.\n\nThe free will is the source of all rational action. But to treat it as a subjective end is to deny the possibility of freedom in general. Because the autonomous will is the one and only source of moral action, it would contradict the first formulation to claim that a person is merely a means to some other end, rather than always an end in themselves.\n\nOn this basis, Kant derives the second formulation of the categorical imperative from the first.\n\nBy combining this formulation with the first, we learn that a person has ''perfect duty'' not to use the humanity of themselves or others merely as a means to some other end. As a [[slavery|slave owner]] would be effectively asserting a moral right to own a person as a slave, they would be asserting a property right in another person. This would violate the categorical imperative, because it denies the basis for there to be free rational action at all; it denies the status of a person as an end in themselves. One cannot, on Kant's account, ever suppose a right to treat another person as a mere means to an end. In the case of a slave owner, the slaves are being used to cultivate the owner's fields (the slaves acting as the means) to ensure a sufficient harvest (the end goal of the owner).\n\nThe second formulation also leads to the ''imperfect duty'' to further the ends of ourselves and others. If any person desires perfection in themselves or others, it would be their moral duty to seek that end for all people equally, so long as that end does not contradict perfect duty.\n\n==The third formulation: the formula of autonomy==\n<div style=\"font-size:115%\">\n{{rquote|right|Thus the third practical principle follows [from the first two] as the ultimate condition of their harmony with practical reason: the idea of ''the will of every rational being as a universally legislating will''.|Immanuel Kant|''Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals''<ref>{{harvnb|Kant|1993|page=43}}. 4:431</ref>}}</div>\n\nKant claims that the first formulation lays out the ''objective'' conditions on the categorical imperative: that it be universal in form and thus capable of becoming a law of nature. Likewise, the second formulation lays out ''subjective'' conditions: that there be certain ends in themselves, namely rational beings as such.<ref>4:431</ref> The result of these two considerations is that we must will maxims that can be at the same time universal, but which do not infringe on the freedom of ourselves nor of others. A universal maxim, however, could only have this form if it were a maxim that each subject by himself endorsed. Because it cannot be something which externally constrains each subject's activity, it must be a constraint that each subject has set for himself. This leads to the concept of ''self''-legislation. Each subject must through his own use of reason will maxims which have the form of universality, but do not impinge on the freedom of others: thus each subject must will maxims that could be universally self-legislated.\n\nThe result, of course, is a formulation of the categorical imperative that contains much of the same as the first two. We must will something that we could at the same time freely will of ourselves. After introducing this third formulation, Kant introduces a distinction between ''[[autonomy]]'' (literally: self-law-giving) and ''[[heteronomy]]'' (literally: other-law-giving). This third formulation makes it clear that the categorical imperative requires autonomy. It is not enough that the right conduct be followed, but that one also demands that conduct of oneself.\n\n==Other formulations==\n\nIn the ''Groundwork'', Kant goes on to formulate the categorical imperative in a number of different ways following the first three; however, because Kant himself claims that there are only three principles,<ref>4:431\u20132; 4:435\u20136</ref> little attention has been given to these other formulations. Moreover, they are often easily assimilated to the first three formulations, as Kant takes himself to be explicitly summarizing these earlier principles.<ref>These additional formulations, of which there are at least eight, can be seen at: 4:434 (1); 4:436\u20137 (1); 4:437 (4); 4:438 (1); 4:438\u20139 (1).</ref>\n\nThere is, however, one additional formulation that has received a lot of additional attention because it appears to introduce a social dimension into Kant's thought. This is the formulation of the \"Kingdom of Ends\":\n\n===The Kingdom of Ends formulation===\n<div style=\"font-size:115%\">\n{{rquote|right|Act according to maxims of a universally legislating member of a merely possible kingdom of ends.|Immanuel Kant|''Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals''<ref name=Kant43>{{harvnb|Kant|1993|page=44}}. 4:439</ref>}}</div>\n\nBecause a truly autonomous will would not be subjugated to any interest, it would only be subject to those laws it makes for itself\u2014but it must also regard those laws as if they would be bound to others, or they would not be universalizable, and hence they would not be laws of conduct at all. Thus Kant presents the notion of the hypothetical [[Kingdom of Ends]] of which he suggests all people should consider themselves never solely as means but always as ends.\n\nWe ought to act only by maxims that would harmonize with a possible kingdom of ends. We have ''perfect duty'' not to act by maxims that create incoherent or impossible states of natural affairs when we attempt to universalize them, and we have ''imperfect duty'' not to act by maxims that lead to unstable or greatly undesirable states of affairs.\n\n==Application==\n\nAlthough Kant was intensely critical of the use of examples as moral yardsticks, because they tend to rely on our moral intuitions (feelings) rather than our rational powers, this section will explore some applications of the categorical imperative for illustrative purposes.\n\n===Deception===\n{{Further|Doctrine of mental reservation}}\nKant asserted that lying, or deception of any kind, would be forbidden under any interpretation and in any circumstance. In the ''Groundwork'', Kant gives the example of a person who seeks to borrow money without intending to pay it back. This is a contradiction because if it were a universal action, no person would lend money anymore as he knows that he will never be paid back.  The maxim of this action, says Kant, results in a {{clarify span|contradiction in conceivability|date=May 2019}} (and thus contradicts perfect duty).  With lying, it would logically contradict the reliability of language. If it were universally acceptable to lie, then no one would believe anyone and all truths would be assumed to be lies.  In each case, the proposed action becomes inconceivable in a world where the maxim exists as law.  In a world where no one would lend money, seeking to borrow money in the manner originally imagined is inconceivable.  In a world where no one trusts one another, the same is true about manipulative lies.\n\nThe right to deceive could also not be claimed because it would deny the status of the person deceived as an end in itself. The theft would be incompatible with a possible kingdom of ends. Therefore, Kant denied the right to lie or deceive for any reason, regardless of context or anticipated consequences.\n\n===Theft===\nKant argued that any action taken against another person to which he or she ''could not possibly'' consent is a violation of perfect duty interpreted through the second formulation. If a thief were to steal a book from an unknowing victim, it may have been that the victim would have agreed, had the thief simply asked. However, no person can consent to theft, because the presence of consent would mean that the transfer was not a theft. Because the victim could not have consented to the action, it could not be instituted as a universal law of nature, and theft contradicts perfect duty.\n\n===Suicide===\nKant applied his categorical imperative to the issue of suicide motivated by a sickness of life in ''The Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals'',{{sfn|Kant|1993|pp=30\u201331}} writing that:\n\n{{quote |text=A man reduced to despair by a series of misfortunes feels sick of life, but is still so far in possession of his reason that he can ask himself whether taking his own life would not be contrary to his duty to himself. Now he asks whether the maxim of his action could become a universal law of nature. But his maxim is this:  from self-love I make as my principle to shorten my life when its continued duration threatens more evil than it promises satisfaction. There only remains the question as to whether this principle of self-love can become a universal law of nature.  One sees at once that a contradiction in a system of nature whose law would destroy life by means of the very same feeling that acts so as to stimulate the furtherance of life, and hence there could be no existence as a system of nature. Therefore, such a maxim cannot possibly hold as a universal law of nature and is, consequently, wholly opposed to the supreme principle of all duty. |author=Immanuel Kant |source=''Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals''{{sfn|Kant|1993|pp=30\u201331}} }}\n\nHow the Categorical Imperative would apply to suicide from other motivations is unclear.\n\n===Laziness===\nKant also applies the categorical imperative in ''The Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals'' on the subject of \"failing to cultivate one's talents.\" He proposes a man who if he cultivated his talents could bring many goods, but he has everything he wants and would prefer to enjoy the pleasures of life instead.  The man asks himself how the universality of such a thing works.  While Kant agrees that a society could subsist if everyone did nothing, he notes that the man would have no pleasures to enjoy, for if everyone let their talents go to waste, there would be no one to create luxuries that created this theoretical situation in the first place.  Not only that, but cultivating one's talents is a duty to oneself.  Thus, it is not willed to make laziness universal, and a rational being has imperfect duty to cultivate its talents.  Kant concludes in The Groundwork:\n\n{{quote |text=...he cannot possibly will that this should become a universal law of nature or be implanted in us as such a law by a natural instinct.  For as a rational being he necessarily wills that all his faculties should be developed, inasmuch as they are given him for all sorts of possible purposes.<ref>{{harvnb|Kant|1993|p=31}}</ref>}}\n\n===Charity===\nKant's last application of the categorical imperative in ''The Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals'' is of charity. He proposes a fourth man who finds his own life fine but sees other people struggling with life and who ponders the outcome of doing nothing to help those in need (while not envying them or accepting anything from them). While Kant admits that humanity could subsist (and admits it could possibly perform better) if this were universal, he states in ''Grounding'':\n\n{{quote |text=But even though it is possible that a universal law of nature could subsist in accordance with that maxim, still it is impossible to will that such a principle should hold everywhere as a law of nature.  For a will that resolved in this way would contradict itself, inasmuch as cases might often arise in which one would have need of the love and sympathy of others and in which he would deprive himself, by such a law of nature springing from his own will, of all hope of the aid he wants for himself.<ref>{{harvnb|Kant|1993|p=32}}</ref>}}\n\n===Cruelty to animals===\nKant derived a prohibition against [[cruelty to animals]] by arguing that such cruelty is a violation of a duty in relation to oneself. According to Kant, man has the imperfect duty to strengthen the feeling of compassion, since this feeling promotes morality in relation to other human beings. However, cruelty to animals deadens the feeling of compassion in man. Therefore, man is obliged not to treat animals brutally (Kant, Metaphysics of Morals, \u00a7 17).\n\n== Criticisms ==\n\n===The Golden Rule===\n\nThe first formulation of the categorical imperative appears similar to [[Ethic of reciprocity|the Golden Rule]]. In its negative form, the rule prescribes: \"Do not impose on others what you do not wish for yourself.\"<ref>Confucius: The Golden Rule by Russel Freedman</ref> In its positive form, the rule states: \"Treat others how you wish to be treated\".<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia  |title=golden rule|editor =[[Antony Flew]] | encyclopedia=A Dictionary of Philosophy |publisher = [[Pan Books]] in association with [[Macmillan Publishers|The MacMillan Press]]   | year = 1979   | location = London | page = 134 | isbn=0-330-48730-2}}</ref> Due to this similarity, some have thought the two are identical.<ref>\"This is indeed the well-known \u201cGolden Rule\u201d that we find in the teachings of Moses, and Confucius, and Jesus, and many others. I think, however, that all three of them would say that the most universal moral rule is even more universal than this one: something like \"Do good and not evil.\" Kreeft, Peter (2009). ''Socrates Meets Kant'' p. 234. Ignatius Press. Kindle Edition.{{ISBN?}}</ref>\n\n[[Peter Corning]] suggests that, \"Kant's objection to the Golden Rule is especially suspect because the categorical imperative (CI) sounds a lot like a paraphrase, or perhaps a close cousin, of the same fundamental idea. In effect, it says that you should act toward others in ways that you would want everyone else to act toward others, yourself included (presumably). Calling it a universal law does not materially improve on the basic concept.\"<ref>\"The Fair Society\"</ref> Corning claims that Ken Binmore thought so as well.\n\nKant himself did not think so in the ''[[Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals|Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals]].'' Rather, the categorical imperative is an attempt to identify ''a purely formal'' and necessarily universally binding rule on all rational agents. The Golden Rule, on the other hand, is neither purely formal nor necessarily universally binding. It is \"empirical\" in the sense that applying it depends on providing content, such as, \"If you don't want others to hit you, then don't hit them.\" It is also a hypothetical imperative in the sense that it can be formulated, \"If you want X done to you, then do X to others.\" Kant feared that the hypothetical clause, \"if you want X done to you,\" remains open to dispute.<ref>Kreeft, Peter (2009). ''Socrates Meets Kant'' p. 236. Ignatius</ref>\n\n===Lying to a murderer===\nOne of the first major challenges to Kant's reasoning came from the [[France|French]] philosopher [[Benjamin Constant]], who asserted that since truth telling must be universal, according to Kant's theories, one must (if asked) tell a known murderer the location of his prey. This challenge occurred while Kant was still alive, and his response was the essay ''On a Supposed Right to Tell Lies from Benevolent Motives'' (sometimes translated ''On a Supposed Right to Lie because of Philanthropic Concerns''). In this reply, Kant agreed with Constant's inference, that from Kant's premises one must infer a moral duty not to lie to a murderer.\n\nKant denied that such an inference indicates any weakness in his premises: not lying to the murderer is required because moral actions do not derive their worth from the expected consequences. He claimed that because lying to the murderer would treat him as a mere means to another end, the lie denies the rationality of another person, and therefore denies the possibility of there being free rational action at all. This lie results in a {{clarify span|text=contradiction in conception|date=May 2019}} and therefore the lie is in conflict with duty.\n\nConstant and Kant agree that ''refusing to answer'' the murderer's question (rather than ''lying'') is consistent with the categorical imperative, but assume for the purposes of argument that refusing to answer would not be an option.\n\n===Questioning autonomy===\n[[Schopenhauer's criticism of Kantian philosophy#Categorical Imperative|Schopenhauer's criticism of the Kantian philosophy]] expresses doubt concerning the absence of [[egoism]] in the categorical imperative. [[Schopenhauer]] claimed that the categorical imperative is actually [[hypothetical]] and egotistical, not categorical.\n\n[[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]] believed Kantian autonomy was insufficient and that, if unchecked, people tend to be lenient in their own case, either by not exercising the full rigor of the moral law or by not properly disciplining themselves of moral transgressions:\n\n{{quote |text=Kant was of the opinion that man is his own law (autonomy)\u2014that is, he binds himself under the law which he himself gives himself. Actually, in a profounder sense, this is how lawlessness or experimentation are established. This is not being rigorously earnest any more than [[Sancho Panza]]'s self-administered blows to his own bottom were vigorous. ... Now if a man is never even once willing in his lifetime to act so decisively that [a lawgiver] can get hold of him, well, then it happens, then the man is allowed to live on in self-complacent illusion and make-believe and experimentation, but this also means: utterly without grace. |source=''Papers and Journals''<ref name=\"Kierkegaard\">{{cite book |last=Green |first=Ronald | title=Kierkegaard and Kant: The Hidden Debt |publisher=SUNY Press |year=1992 |pages=90\u201391}}</ref>}}\n\n== Application ==\n\n=== The trial of Adolf Eichmann ===\nIn 1961, discussion of Kant's categorical imperative was even included in the trial of the [[SS]] Lieutenant Colonel [[Adolf Eichmann]] in [[Jerusalem]].\n\nAs [[Hannah Arendt]] wrote in her book on the trial, Eichmann declared \"with great emphasis that he had lived his whole life ... according to a Kantian definition of duty\".

To blame population growth instead of extreme and selective consumerism on the part of some, is one way of refusing to face the issues. It is an attempt to legitimize the present model of distribution, where a minority believes that it has the right to consume in a way which can never be universalized, since the planet could not even contain the waste products of such consumption.<ref>[[Pope Francis]], ''Encyclical Letter ''Laudato Si'' of the Holy Father Francis on Care for Our Common Home'', \u00a7 50, [http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20150524_enciclica-laudato-si.html May 24, 2015]</ref>\n\n=== Game theory ===\nOne form of the categorical imperative is [[superrationality]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Reviews |first=Paul J. |last=Campbell |journal=Mathematics Magazine |volume=57 |issue=1 |date=January 1984 |pages=51\u201355 |jstor=2690298}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Volunteer's Dilemma |first=Andreas |last=Diekmann |journal=The Journal of Conflict Resolution |volume=29 |issue=4 |date=December 1985 |pages=605\u2013610 |doi=10.1177/0022002785029004003 |jstor=174243}}</ref> The concept was elucidated by [[Douglas Hofstadter]] as a new approach to [[game theory]].

He was less successful in extending control into Wales. William is commonly known as '''William Rufus''' ({{lang|la|Rufus}} being Latin for \"the Red\"), perhaps because of his ruddy appearance or, more likely, due to having red hair as a child that grew out in later life.<ref>Barlow ''William Rufus'' pp. 11\u201312</ref>{{efn|{{lang|la|De Miraculis Sancti Eadmundi|italic=no}} is alone in calling him William Longsword.<ref>Mason, ''King Rufus: The Life and Murder of William II of England'', p. 10</ref>}}\n\nWilliam was a figure of complex temperament, capable of both bellicosity and flamboyance.

Barlow noted, \"His chivalrous virtues and achievements were all too obvious. He had maintained good order and satisfactory justice in England and restored good peace to Normandy. He had extended Anglo-Norman rule in Wales, brought Scotland firmly under his lordship, recovered [[Maine (province)|Maine]], and kept up the pressure on the [[Vexin]].\"<ref>Frank Barlow, \"William II (c.1060\u20131100)\", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (Oxford University Press, 2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29449, online accessed 28 Nov 2013]</ref>\n\n==Early years==\nWilliam's exact date of birth is not known, but it was some time between the years 1056 and 1060. He was the third of four sons born to [[William the Conqueror]] and [[Matilda of Flanders]], the eldest being [[Robert Curthose]], the second [[Richard, son of William the Conqueror|Richard]], and the youngest [[Henry I of England|Henry]]. Richard died around 1075 while hunting in the [[New Forest]]. William succeeded to the throne of England on his father's death in 1087, but Robert inherited Normandy.<ref name=Douglas393>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' p. 393</ref>\n\nWilliam had five or six sisters. The existence of sisters [[Adeliza]] and Matilda is not absolutely certain, but four sisters are more securely attested:\n* [[Adela of Normandy|Adela]], who married [[Stephen, Count of Blois|the Count of Blois]]\n* [[Cecilia of Normandy|Cecily]], who became a nun\n* [[Agatha of Normandy|Agatha]], who died unmarried\n* [[Constance of Normandy|Constance]], who married the Duke of Brittany.<ref name=Douglas395>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' p. 395</ref>\n\nRecords indicate strained relations between the three surviving sons of William I. William's contemporary, chronicler [[Orderic Vitalis]], wrote about an incident that took place at [[L'Aigle]] in Normandy in 1077 or 1078: William and Henry, having grown bored with casting dice, decided to make mischief by emptying a [[chamber pot]] onto their brother Robert from an upper gallery, thus infuriating and shaming him. A brawl broke out, and their father had to intercede to restore order.<ref name=Barlow33>Barlow ''William Rufus pp. 33\u201334</ref>{{efn|Barlow suggests that William and Henry probably urinated over Robert.<ref name=Barlow33/>}}\n\nAccording to [[William of Malmesbury]], writing in the 12th century, William Rufus was \"well set; his complexion florid, his hair yellow; of open countenance; different coloured eyes, varying with certain glittering specks; of astonishing strength, though not very tall, and his belly rather projecting.\"<ref>William of Malmesbury ''History of the Norman Kings'' p. 70</ref>\n\n==England and France==\n[[File:Great Seal of William Rufus.jpg|thumb|left|Great Seal of William II]]\n\nThe division of William the Conqueror's lands into two parts presented a dilemma for those nobles who held land on both sides of the English Channel. Since the younger William and his brother Robert were natural rivals, these nobles worried that they could not hope to please both of their lords, and thus ran the risk of losing the favour of one ruler or the other, or both.<ref>Carpenter, ''Struggle for Mastery'', p. 125 f.</ref> The only solution, as they saw it, was to unite England and Normandy once more under one ruler. The pursuit of this aim led them to revolt against William in favour of Robert in the [[Rebellion of 1088]], under the leadership of the powerful Bishop [[Odo of Bayeux]], who was a half-brother of William the Conqueror.<ref name=Carpenter129>Carpenter, ''Struggle for Mastery'', p. 129.</ref> As Robert failed to appear in England to rally his supporters, William won the support of the English with silver and promises of better government, and defeated the rebellion, thus securing his authority. In 1091 he invaded Normandy, crushing Robert's forces and forcing him to cede a portion of his lands. The two made up their differences and William agreed to help Robert recover lands lost to France, notably [[Maine (province)|Maine]]. This plan was later abandoned, but William continued to pursue a ferociously warlike defence of his French possessions and interests to the end of his life, exemplified by his response to the attempt by [[Elias I, Count of Maine|Elias de la Fl\u00e8che]], [[Counts and dukes of Maine|Count of Maine]], to take [[Le Mans]] in 1099.<ref>Barlow, ''William Rufus'', pp. 402\u2013406.</ref>\n\nWilliam Rufus was thus secure in what was then the most powerful kingdom in Europe, given the contemporary eclipse of the [[Salian dynasty|Salian]] emperors. As in Normandy, his bishops and abbots were bound to him by feudal obligations; and his right of investiture in the Norman tradition prevailed within his kingdom, during the age of the [[Investiture Controversy]] that brought excommunication upon the Salian Emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]]. The king's personal power, through an effective and loyal [[Chancery (medieval office)|chancery]], penetrated to the local level to an extent unmatched in France. The king's administration and law unified the realm, rendering him relatively impervious to papal condemnation.  In 1097 he commenced the original [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster Hall]], which when completed in 1099 was the largest hall in Europe, built \"to impress his subjects with the power and majesty of his authority\".<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Cescinsky |first1=Herbert |last2=Gribble |first2=Ernest R. |date=February 1922 |title=Westminster Hall and Its Roof |journal=The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs |volume=40 |issue=227 |pages=76\u201384 |jstor=861585}} {{Subscription required}}</ref>\n\n==Religion==\n\n[[File:Silver penny of William II (YORYM 2000 2062) obverse.jpg|thumb|upright|Silver penny of William II showing a crowned head facing forward (1089), [[Yorkshire Museum]], York]]\nLess than two years after becoming king, William II lost his father's adviser and confidant, the Italian-Norman [[Lanfranc]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. After Lanfranc's death in 1089, the king delayed appointing a new archbishop for many years, appropriating ecclesiastical revenues in the interim. In panic, owing to serious illness in 1093, William nominated as archbishop another Norman-Italian, [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]]&nbsp;\u2013 considered the greatest theologian of his generation&nbsp;\u2013 but this led to a long period of animosity between Church and State, Anselm being a stronger supporter of the [[Gregorian Reform|Gregorian reforms]] in the Church than Lanfranc. William and Anselm disagreed on a range of ecclesiastical issues, in the course of which the king declared of Anselm that, \"Yesterday I hated him with great hatred, today I hate him with yet greater hatred and he can be certain that tomorrow and thereafter I shall hate him continually with ever fiercer and more bitter hatred.\"<ref>Bosanquet (tr.) ''Eadmer's History'' p. 53</ref> The English clergy, beholden to the king for their preferments and livings, were unable to support Anselm publicly. In 1095 William called a council at [[Rockingham, Northamptonshire|Rockingham]] to bring Anselm to heel, but the archbishop remained firm. In October 1097, Anselm went into exile, taking his case to the Pope. The diplomatic and flexible [[Pope Urban II|Urban II]], a new pope, was involved in a major conflict with [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV]], who supported an [[antipope]]. Reluctant to make another enemy, Urban came to a [[concordat]] with William, whereby William recognised Urban as pope, and Urban gave sanction to the Anglo-Norman ecclesiastical ''status quo''. Anselm remained in exile, and William was able to claim the revenues of the archbishop of Canterbury to the end of his reign.<ref>Carpenter ''Struggle for Mastery'' p. 132</ref>\n\nHowever, this conflict was symptomatic of medieval English politics, as exemplified by the murder of [[Thomas Becket]] during the reign of the later [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet]] king [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (his great-nephew through his brother Henry) and [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s actions centuries later, and as such should not be seen as a defect of William's reign in particular.{{efn|According to [[Eadmer]], an unusually well placed witness, William II \"protested that Archbishop [[Anselm of Canterbury]] could not possibly keep at the same time both the allegiance which he owed to the King and obedience to the Apostolic See against the King's will.\"<ref>Bosanquet (tr.) ''Eadmer's History'' p. 54</ref> Anselm found himself in similar conflict with William II's successor, [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], as also reported by Eadmer.}} Of course, contemporary churchmen were themselves not above engaging in such politics: it is reported that, when Archbishop Lanfranc suggested to William I that he imprison the rebellious bishop [[Odo of Bayeux]], he exclaimed \"What! he is a clergyman.\" Lanfranc retorted that \"You will not seize the bishop of Bayeux, but confine the earl of Kent.\" (Odo held both titles.)<ref>William of Malmesbury ''History of the Norman Kings'' p. 60</ref>\n\nWhile there are complaints of contemporaries regarding William's personal behaviour, he was instrumental in assisting the foundation of [[Bermondsey Abbey]], endowing it with the manor of Bermondsey; and it is reported that his \"customary oath\" was \"By the [[Holy Face of Lucca|Face at Lucca]]!\"{{efn|For an interesting discussion of such blasphemous oaths, see Barlow, F., ''William Rufus'', Univ. of California Press, 1983, pp. 116\u20138. An alternative, pagan interpretation of this oath proposed by [[Margaret Murray]] is that William swore by the \"face of [[Loki]]\": Murray, Margaret A., ''The God of the Witches'', [[Oxford University Press|OUP]], 1970, p.&nbsp;164.}} It seems reasonable to suppose that such details are indicative of William's personal beliefs.\n\n==War and rebellion==\n\nWilliam Rufus inherited the Anglo-Norman settlement detailed in the [[Domesday Book]], a survey undertaken at his father's command, essentially for the purposes of taxation, which was an example of the control of the English monarchy. If he was less effective than his father in containing the Norman lords' propensity for rebellion and violence, through charisma or political skills, he was forceful in overcoming the consequences. In 1095, [[Robert de Mowbray]], the earl of [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]], refused to attend the ''[[Curia regis|Curia Regis]]'', the thrice-annual court where the King announced his governmental decisions to the great lords. William led an army against Robert and defeated him. Robert was dispossessed and imprisoned, and another noble, [[William II, Count of Eu|William of Eu]], accused of treachery, was blinded and [[Castration|castrated]].<ref>Carpenter, ''Struggle for Mastery'', p. 131.</ref>\n\nIn external affairs, William had some successes. In 1091 he repulsed an invasion by King [[Malcolm III of Scotland]], forcing Malcolm to pay homage. In 1092 he built [[Carlisle Castle]], taking control of [[Cumberland]] and [[Westmorland]], which had previously been claimed by the Scots.<ref name=Carpenter129/> Subsequently, the two kings quarrelled over Malcolm's possessions in England, and Malcolm again invaded, ravaging Northumbria. At the [[Battle of Alnwick (1093)|Battle of Alnwick]], on 13 November 1093, Malcolm was ambushed by Norman forces led by Robert de Mowbray. Malcolm and his son Edward were killed and Malcolm's brother [[Donald III of Scotland|Donald]] seized the throne. William supported Malcolm's son [[Duncan II of Scotland|Duncan II]], who held power for a short time, and then another of Malcolm's sons, [[Edgar, King of Scotland|Edgar]]. Edgar conquered [[Lothian]] in 1094 and eventually removed Donald in 1097 with William's aid in a campaign led by [[Edgar \u00c6theling]]. The new king recognised William's authority over Lothian and attended William's court.\n\nWilliam made two forays into Wales in 1097. Nothing decisive was achieved, but a series of castles was constructed as a marchland defensive barrier.<ref>Philip J. Potter, ''Gothic Kings of Britain: The Lives of 31 Medieval Rulers, 1016-1399'' (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=h_zW8TBBVQkC&pg=PA47&lpg=PA47#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 47].</ref>\n\nIn 1096, William's brother Robert Curthose joined the [[First Crusade]]. He needed money to fund this venture and pledged his [[Duchy of Normandy]] to William in return for a payment of 10,000 marks, which equates to about a quarter of William's annual revenue. In a display of the effectiveness of English taxation, William raised the money by levying a special, heavy, and much-resented tax upon the whole of England. He then ruled Normandy as regent in Robert's absence. Robert did not return until September 1100, one month after William's death.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Robert-II-duke-of-Normandy|title=Robert II {{!}} duke of Normandy|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=12 September 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAs regent in Normandy, William campaigned in France from 1097 to 1099. He secured northern Maine but failed to seize the French-controlled part of the [[Vexin]] region. According to William of Malmesbury he was planning to invade the [[Duchy of Aquitaine]] at the time of his death.<ref>Gillingham, William II, p.97</ref>\n\n==Death==\nWilliam went hunting on 2 August 1100 in the New Forest, probably near [[Brockenhurst]], and was killed by an arrow through the lung, though the circumstances remain unclear.

''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' p. 235</ref> [[Chronicle]]rs tended to take a dim view of William's reign, arguably on account of his long and difficult struggles with the Church: these chroniclers were themselves generally clerics, and so might be expected to report him somewhat negatively. His chief minister was [[Ranulf Flambard]], whom he appointed [[Bishop of Durham]] in 1099: this was a political appointment, to a [[Episcopal see|see]] that was also a great [[fief]]dom. The particulars of the king's relationship with the people of England are not credibly documented. Contemporaries of William, as well as those writing after his death, roundly denounced him for presiding over what these dissenters considered a dissolute court. In keeping with tradition of Norman leaders, William scorned the English and the English culture.<ref>Cantor ''Civilization of the Middle Ages'' pp. 280\u2013284</ref>\n\n==Sexuality==\n\nContemporaries of William raised concerns about a court dominated by homosexuality and effeminacy, although this appears to have had more to do with their luxurious attire than with actual sexual practices.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mills |first1=Robert |title=Seeing Sodomy in the Middle Ages |date=2015 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=9780226169262 |pages=82-83 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e6J0BgAAQBAJ |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe historian Emma Mason has noted that while during his reign William himself was never openly accused of homosexuality, in the decades after his death numerous medieval writers spoke of this and a few began to describe him as a \"sodomite\".<ref name=\":0\">Mason, ''King Rufus: The Life and Murder of William II of England'', pp. 9\u201325</ref> Modern historians cannot state with certainty whether William was homosexual or not; however, he never took a wife or a mistress, or fathered any children.

Barlow noted, \"His chivalrous virtues and achievements were all too obvious. He had maintained good order and satisfactory justice in England and restored good peace to Normandy.

A brawl broke out, and their father had to intercede to restore order.<ref name=Barlow33>Barlow ''William Rufus pp. 33\u201334</ref>{{efn|Barlow suggests that William and Henry probably urinated over Robert.<ref name=Barlow33/>}}\n\nAccording to [[William of Malmesbury]], writing in the 12th century, William Rufus was \"well set; his complexion florid, his hair yellow; of open countenance; different coloured eyes, varying with certain glittering specks; of astonishing strength, though not very tall, and his belly rather projecting.\"<ref>William of Malmesbury ''History of the Norman Kings'' p. 70</ref>\n\n==England and France==\n[[File:Great Seal of William Rufus.jpg|thumb|left|Great Seal of William II]]\n\nThe division of William the Conqueror's lands into two parts presented a dilemma for those nobles who held land on both sides of the English Channel. Since the younger William and his brother Robert were natural rivals, these nobles worried that they could not hope to please both of their lords, and thus ran the risk of losing the favour of one ruler or the other, or both.<ref>Carpenter, ''Struggle for Mastery'', p. 125 f.</ref> The only solution, as they saw it, was to unite England and Normandy once more under one ruler. The pursuit of this aim led them to revolt against William in favour of Robert in the [[Rebellion of 1088]], under the leadership of the powerful Bishop [[Odo of Bayeux]], who was a half-brother of William the Conqueror.<ref name=Carpenter129>Carpenter, ''Struggle for Mastery'', p. 129.</ref> As Robert failed to appear in England to rally his supporters, William won the support of the English with silver and promises of better government, and defeated the rebellion, thus securing his authority. In 1091 he invaded Normandy, crushing Robert's forces and forcing him to cede a portion of his lands. The two made up their differences and William agreed to help Robert recover lands lost to France, notably [[Maine (province)|Maine]]. This plan was later abandoned, but William continued to pursue a ferociously warlike defence of his French possessions and interests to the end of his life, exemplified by his response to the attempt by [[Elias I, Count of Maine|Elias de la Fl\u00e8che]], [[Counts and dukes of Maine|Count of Maine]], to take [[Le Mans]] in 1099.<ref>Barlow, ''William Rufus'', pp. 402\u2013406.</ref>\n\nWilliam Rufus was thus secure in what was then the most powerful kingdom in Europe, given the contemporary eclipse of the [[Salian dynasty|Salian]] emperors. As in Normandy, his bishops and abbots were bound to him by feudal obligations; and his right of investiture in the Norman tradition prevailed within his kingdom, during the age of the [[Investiture Controversy]] that brought excommunication upon the Salian Emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]]. The king's personal power, through an effective and loyal [[Chancery (medieval office)|chancery]], penetrated to the local level to an extent unmatched in France. The king's administration and law unified the realm, rendering him relatively impervious to papal condemnation.  In 1097 he commenced the original [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster Hall]], which when completed in 1099 was the largest hall in Europe, built \"to impress his subjects with the power and majesty of his authority\".<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Cescinsky |first1=Herbert |last2=Gribble |first2=Ernest R. |date=February 1922 |title=Westminster Hall and Its Roof |journal=The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs |volume=40 |issue=227 |pages=76\u201384 |jstor=861585}} {{Subscription required}}</ref>\n\n==Religion==\n\n[[File:Silver penny of William II (YORYM 2000 2062) obverse.jpg|thumb|upright|Silver penny of William II showing a crowned head facing forward (1089), [[Yorkshire Museum]], York]]\nLess than two years after becoming king, William II lost his father's adviser and confidant, the Italian-Norman [[Lanfranc]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. After Lanfranc's death in 1089, the king delayed appointing a new archbishop for many years, appropriating ecclesiastical revenues in the interim. In panic, owing to serious illness in 1093, William nominated as archbishop another Norman-Italian, [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]]&nbsp;\u2013 considered the greatest theologian of his generation&nbsp;\u2013 but this led to a long period of animosity between Church and State, Anselm being a stronger supporter of the [[Gregorian Reform|Gregorian reforms]] in the Church than Lanfranc. William and Anselm disagreed on a range of ecclesiastical issues, in the course of which the king declared of Anselm that, \"Yesterday I hated him with great hatred, today I hate him with yet greater hatred and he can be certain that tomorrow and thereafter I shall hate him continually with ever fiercer and more bitter hatred.\"<ref>Bosanquet (tr.) ''Eadmer's History'' p. 53</ref> The English clergy, beholden to the king for their preferments and livings, were unable to support Anselm publicly. In 1095 William called a council at [[Rockingham, Northamptonshire|Rockingham]] to bring Anselm to heel, but the archbishop remained firm. In October 1097, Anselm went into exile, taking his case to the Pope. The diplomatic and flexible [[Pope Urban II|Urban II]], a new pope, was involved in a major conflict with [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV]], who supported an [[antipope]]. Reluctant to make another enemy, Urban came to a [[concordat]] with William, whereby William recognised Urban as pope, and Urban gave sanction to the Anglo-Norman ecclesiastical ''status quo''. Anselm remained in exile, and William was able to claim the revenues of the archbishop of Canterbury to the end of his reign.<ref>Carpenter ''Struggle for Mastery'' p. 132</ref>\n\nHowever, this conflict was symptomatic of medieval English politics, as exemplified by the murder of [[Thomas Becket]] during the reign of the later [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet]] king [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (his great-nephew through his brother Henry) and [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s actions centuries later, and as such should not be seen as a defect of William's reign in particular.{{efn|According to [[Eadmer]], an unusually well placed witness, William II \"protested that Archbishop [[Anselm of Canterbury]] could not possibly keep at the same time both the allegiance which he owed to the King and obedience to the Apostolic See against the King's will.\"<ref>Bosanquet (tr.) ''Eadmer's History'' p. 54</ref> Anselm found himself in similar conflict with William II's successor, [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], as also reported by Eadmer.}} Of course, contemporary churchmen were themselves not above engaging in such politics: it is reported that, when Archbishop Lanfranc suggested to William I that he imprison the rebellious bishop [[Odo of Bayeux]], he exclaimed \"What! he is a clergyman.\" Lanfranc retorted that \"You will not seize the bishop of Bayeux, but confine the earl of Kent.\" (Odo held both titles.)<ref>William of Malmesbury ''History of the Norman Kings'' p. 60</ref>\n\nWhile there are complaints of contemporaries regarding William's personal behaviour, he was instrumental in assisting the foundation of [[Bermondsey Abbey]], endowing it with the manor of Bermondsey; and it is reported that his \"customary oath\" was \"By the [[Holy Face of Lucca|Face at Lucca]]!\"{{efn|For an interesting discussion of such blasphemous oaths, see Barlow, F., ''William Rufus'', Univ. of California Press, 1983, pp. 116\u20138. An alternative, pagan interpretation of this oath proposed by [[Margaret Murray]] is that William swore by the \"face of [[Loki]]\": Murray, Margaret A., ''The God of the Witches'', [[Oxford University Press|OUP]], 1970, p.&nbsp;164.}} It seems reasonable to suppose that such details are indicative of William's personal beliefs.\n\n==War and rebellion==\n\nWilliam Rufus inherited the Anglo-Norman settlement detailed in the [[Domesday Book]], a survey undertaken at his father's command, essentially for the purposes of taxation, which was an example of the control of the English monarchy. If he was less effective than his father in containing the Norman lords' propensity for rebellion and violence, through charisma or political skills, he was forceful in overcoming the consequences. In 1095, [[Robert de Mowbray]], the earl of [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]], refused to attend the ''[[Curia regis|Curia Regis]]'', the thrice-annual court where the King announced his governmental decisions to the great lords. William led an army against Robert and defeated him. Robert was dispossessed and imprisoned, and another noble, [[William II, Count of Eu|William of Eu]], accused of treachery, was blinded and [[Castration|castrated]].<ref>Carpenter, ''Struggle for Mastery'', p. 131.</ref>\n\nIn external affairs, William had some successes. In 1091 he repulsed an invasion by King [[Malcolm III of Scotland]], forcing Malcolm to pay homage. In 1092 he built [[Carlisle Castle]], taking control of [[Cumberland]] and [[Westmorland]], which had previously been claimed by the Scots.<ref name=Carpenter129/> Subsequently, the two kings quarrelled over Malcolm's possessions in England, and Malcolm again invaded, ravaging Northumbria. At the [[Battle of Alnwick (1093)|Battle of Alnwick]], on 13 November 1093, Malcolm was ambushed by Norman forces led by Robert de Mowbray. Malcolm and his son Edward were killed and Malcolm's brother [[Donald III of Scotland|Donald]] seized the throne. William supported Malcolm's son [[Duncan II of Scotland|Duncan II]], who held power for a short time, and then another of Malcolm's sons, [[Edgar, King of Scotland|Edgar]]. Edgar conquered [[Lothian]] in 1094 and eventually removed Donald in 1097 with William's aid in a campaign led by [[Edgar \u00c6theling]]. The new king recognised William's authority over Lothian and attended William's court.\n\nWilliam made two forays into Wales in 1097. Nothing decisive was achieved, but a series of castles was constructed as a marchland defensive barrier.<ref>Philip J. Potter, ''Gothic Kings of Britain: The Lives of 31 Medieval Rulers, 1016-1399'' (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=h_zW8TBBVQkC&pg=PA47&lpg=PA47#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 47].</ref>\n\nIn 1096, William's brother Robert Curthose joined the [[First Crusade]]. He needed money to fund this venture and pledged his [[Duchy of Normandy]] to William in return for a payment of 10,000 marks, which equates to about a quarter of William's annual revenue. In a display of the effectiveness of English taxation, William raised the money by levying a special, heavy, and much-resented tax upon the whole of England. He then ruled Normandy as regent in Robert's absence. Robert did not return until September 1100, one month after William's death.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Robert-II-duke-of-Normandy|title=Robert II {{!}} duke of Normandy|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=12 September 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAs regent in Normandy, William campaigned in France from 1097 to 1099. He secured northern Maine but failed to seize the French-controlled part of the [[Vexin]] region. According to William of Malmesbury he was planning to invade the [[Duchy of Aquitaine]] at the time of his death.<ref>Gillingham, William II, p.97</ref>\n\n==Death==\nWilliam went hunting on 2 August 1100 in the New Forest, probably near [[Brockenhurst]], and was killed by an arrow through the lung, though the circumstances remain unclear.

His chief minister was [[Ranulf Flambard]], whom he appointed [[Bishop of Durham]] in 1099: this was a political appointment, to a [[Episcopal see|see]] that was also a great [[fief]]dom. The particulars of the king's relationship with the people of England are not credibly documented. Contemporaries of William, as well as those writing after his death, roundly denounced him for presiding over what these dissenters considered a dissolute court.

The album features production by 2Pac himself alongside a variety of producers, including [[DJ Quik]], [[Johnny \"J\"]], [[Dr. Dre]], [[Rick Rock]], [[Daz Dillinger]], [[DJ Pooh]], [[DeVante Swing]], among others.\n\nThe album features the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number-one singles \"[[How Do U Want It]]\" and \"[[California Love]]\". It featured five singles in all, the most of any of Shakur's albums. Moreover, ''All Eyez on Me'' made history as the first ever double-full-length hip-hop solo studio album released for mass consumption globally.\n\n''All Eyez on Me'' was the second album by 2Pac to chart at number one on both the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] charts, selling 566,000 copies in the first week. The album won the 1997 Soul Train R&B/Soul or Rap Album of the Year Award posthumously.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eonline.com/news/maxwell_tupac_top_soul_train_awards/34166 |title=Maxwell, Tupac Top Soul Train Awards |publisher=E!

At the time, Shakur was broke and thus unable to make bail himself. ''All Eyez on Me'' was released following an agreement between Knight and Shakur which stated Shakur would make three albums under [[Death Row Records]] in return for them paying his bail. Fulfilling part of Shakur's brand new contract, this double-album served as the first two albums of his three-album contract.<ref>{{cite web|author1=David Drake|author2=Erik Ross|author3=Lauren Nostro|author4=Ted Simmons|author5=Insanul Ahmed|title=16 Label Changes That Shocked The Rap Game|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2013/04/16-label-changes-that-shocked-the-rap-game/tupac-leaves-interscope|website=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|accessdate=November 30, 2016|date=April 5, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=San Miguel|first1=Danielito|title=Tupac's official contract with Death Row Records.

[[DJ Quik]] also produced, mixed and made an appearance on the album, but had to use his real name on the credits because his contract with [[Profile Records]] prevented him from using his stage name.\n\n===Lyrical themes===\nThe songs on ''All Eyez on Me'' are, in general, unapologetic celebrations of living the \"Thug Lifestyle\". Though there is the occasional reminiscence about past and present friends, it is a definite move away from the social and political consciousness of ''[[2Pacalypse Now]]'' and ''[[Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tupac Interview by Bill Bellamy 1996 (HQ)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G28BVWkHY-E|website=YouTube|accessdate=November 30, 2016}}</ref> The songs on the album along with the name of the album itself, allude to the feeling of being watched. With songs like \"Can't C Me\" and \"All Eyez on Me\", 2Pac makes it known that he feels the presence of surveillance, most notably by the police. The album also references the fact that 2Pac is under the attention of many fans, being his fourth studio album.<ref>Nielson, Erik. \"\"Can't C Me\": Surveillance and Rap Music.\" Journal of Black Studies 40.6 (2010): 1254-274.

The video portrays a wild sex party with jacuzzi, mechanical bull riding, cage dancing and pole stripping.

With all the controversy surrounding him, 2Pac seemingly wanted to throw down a monumental epic whose sheer scope would make it an achievement of itself. But more than that, it's also an unabashed embrace of the gangsta lifestyle, backing off the sober self-recognition of ''[[Me Against the World]]''. Sure, there are a few reflective numbers and dead-homiez tributes, but they're much more romanticized this time around.

The album features production by 2Pac himself alongside a variety of producers, including [[DJ Quik]], [[Johnny \"J\"]], [[Dr. Dre]], [[Rick Rock]], [[Daz Dillinger]], [[DJ Pooh]], [[DeVante Swing]], among others.\n\nThe album features the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number-one singles \"[[How Do U Want It]]\" and \"[[California Love]]\". It featured five singles in all, the most of any of Shakur's albums. Moreover, ''All Eyez on Me'' made history as the first ever double-full-length hip-hop solo studio album released for mass consumption globally.\n\n''All Eyez on Me'' was the second album by 2Pac to chart at number one on both the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] charts, selling 566,000 copies in the first week. The album won the 1997 Soul Train R&B/Soul or Rap Album of the Year Award posthumously.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eonline.com/news/maxwell_tupac_top_soul_train_awards/34166 |title=Maxwell, Tupac Top Soul Train Awards |publisher=E!

At the time, Shakur was broke and thus unable to make bail himself. ''All Eyez on Me'' was released following an agreement between Knight and Shakur which stated Shakur would make three albums under [[Death Row Records]] in return for them paying his bail. Fulfilling part of Shakur's brand new contract, this double-album served as the first two albums of his three-album contract.<ref>{{cite web|author1=David Drake|author2=Erik Ross|author3=Lauren Nostro|author4=Ted Simmons|author5=Insanul Ahmed|title=16 Label Changes That Shocked The Rap Game|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2013/04/16-label-changes-that-shocked-the-rap-game/tupac-leaves-interscope|website=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|accessdate=November 30, 2016|date=April 5, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=San Miguel|first1=Danielito|title=Tupac's official contract with Death Row Records.

[[DJ Quik]] also produced, mixed and made an appearance on the album, but had to use his real name on the credits because his contract with [[Profile Records]] prevented him from using his stage name.\n\n===Lyrical themes===\nThe songs on ''All Eyez on Me'' are, in general, unapologetic celebrations of living the \"Thug Lifestyle\". Though there is the occasional reminiscence about past and present friends, it is a definite move away from the social and political consciousness of ''[[2Pacalypse Now]]'' and ''[[Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tupac Interview by Bill Bellamy 1996 (HQ)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G28BVWkHY-E|website=YouTube|accessdate=November 30, 2016}}</ref> The songs on the album along with the name of the album itself, allude to the feeling of being watched. With songs like \"Can't C Me\" and \"All Eyez on Me\", 2Pac makes it known that he feels the presence of surveillance, most notably by the police. The album also references the fact that 2Pac is under the attention of many fans, being his fourth studio album.<ref>Nielson, Erik. \"\"Can't C Me\": Surveillance and Rap Music.\" Journal of Black Studies 40.6 (2010): 1254-274.

[[Bar-Ilan University]] operates a ''midrasha'', and students in all disciplines may then continue Torah study in parallel with their academic studies (with a requirement of at least seven courses in Judaism<ref>[https://midrasha.biu.ac.il/en/node/406 Bar-Ilan ''Midrasha'']</ref>).\nSeveral Haredi and Hasidic institutions likewise offer certificates, and sometimes degrees, in Education.

Most ''{{lang|he-Latn|midrashot}}'' in this latter category are [[Haredi]] aligned, and are modeled on the [[Beis Yaakov]] teacher-training seminary established by [[Sarah Schenirer]] (for example [[Beth Jacob Jerusalem]]).\n[[Hassidic]]-aligned institutions (for example [[Beth Rivkah]]) similarly, studying the works of their [[Rebbe]]s. \n\nMany Israeli women study at a Midrasha, post high school (examples are [[Ein_HaNetziv#Education|Ein HaNatziv]] and [[Migdal Oz (seminary)|Migdal Oz]]).\nOften studies continue at one of the religious affiliated [[List_of_universities_and_colleges_in_Israel#Colleges|teacher training colleges]], which offer a religious studies program in conjunction with the [[B.Ed.]] degree. \nSpecializations are often offered in ''Tanakh''  or Jewish philosophy.\nOther institutions such as [[Machon Tal]], associated with the [[Jerusalem College of Technology]], similarly offer degrees in engineering or management. [[Bar-Ilan University]] operates a ''midrasha'', and students in all disciplines may then continue Torah study in parallel with their academic studies (with a requirement of at least seven courses in Judaism<ref>[https://midrasha.biu.ac.il/en/node/406 Bar-Ilan ''Midrasha'']</ref>).\nSeveral Haredi and Hasidic institutions likewise offer certificates, and sometimes degrees, in Education. See also [[The Haredi Campus - The Academic College Ono]].\n\nMany diaspora-based Orthodox Jewish girls attend a ''{{lang|he-Latn|midrasha}}'' in Israel for a year or more following high school. \nSome ''{{lang|he-Latn|midrashot}}'' are designed for [[baal teshuva|the newly observant]] (for example [[Neve Yerushalayim]], [[Machon Roni]]).\nMost ''{{lang|he-Latn|midrashot}}'' for English-speaking students are accredited by American colleges. Some ''{{lang|he-Latn|midrashot}}'' offer second-year programs with religious-studies classes in the morning and general-studies classes in the afternoons, allowing students to pursue a religious education and a general-studies education leading to a college degree simultaneously. \n<!-- \n==Coed high school Midrashot==\nWhile a [[Hebrew school]] program typically handles [[Jewish education]] for youths before their [[Bar/Bat Mitzvah]], students who wish to continue their Jewish education through high school enroll in a Midrasha.\n -->\n\n==See also==\n* [[Beis Yaakov]]\n* [[List of Midrashot]]\n* [[Role of women in Judaism]]\n* [[Female seminary]]\n* [[Religious Zionism #Educational institutions]]\n* [[Haredi Judaism #Education]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{OrthodoxJudaism}}\n{{Jewish education}}\n\n<!-- Categories -->\n[[Category:Jewish educational institutions]]\n[[Category:Modern Orthodox Judaism]]\n[[Category:Orthodox Jewish schools for women]]\n", "name_user": "Fintor", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eStructure", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midrasha"}
