Originally a [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] group, their musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres. Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary, touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth, loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism. Their work features references to literature and psychological concepts and includes an [[Parallel universes in fiction|alternative universe]] storyline. The group have staged several world tours.\n\nThe group initially formed as teenagers under [[Big Hit Entertainment]] and released their debut single album, ''[[2 Cool 4 Skool]]'' (2013). Subsequent work such as their first U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] entries ''[[The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 2]]'' (2015), ''[[The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever]]'' (2016), and ''[[Wings (BTS album)|Wings]]'' (2016) helped establish BTS' reputation as a socially conscious group. ''Wings'' became BTS' first album to sell one million copies in South Korea. By 2017, BTS crossed into the international music market, leading the [[Korean Wave]] into the United States and breaking numerous sales records, becoming the first Korean group to receive a certification from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for their single \"[[Mic Drop (song)|Mic Drop]]\". The band is the first Korean act to top the ''Billboard'' 200 with their studio album ''[[Love Yourself: Tear]]'' (2018) and have since hit the top of the U.S. charts with their albums ''[[Love Yourself: Answer]]'' (2018), ''[[Map of the Soul: Persona]]'' (2019) and ''[[Map of the Soul: 7]]'' (2020), making BTS the fastest group since [[the Beatles]] to earn four number one albums in less than two years. ''Love Yourself: Answer'' also broke South Korea's [[Gaon Album Chart]]'s all-time monthly record previously set by ''Love Yourself: Tear'' and became the first Korean album certified Platinum in the United States.\n\nHaving sold over 20 million albums on the [[Gaon Music Chart]], BTS is the best-selling artist in South Korean history and holds the [[List of best-selling albums in South Korea|best-selling album in South Korea]] with ''Map of the Soul: 7''. BTS were the second best-selling artists of 2018 worldwide according to the [[IFPI]]'s Global Artist Chart, as well as the only non-English speaking artist to enter the chart. The group has won [[Billboard Music Award for Top Social Artist|Top Social Artist]] three years in a row and [[Billboard Music Award for Top Duo/Group|Top Duo/Group]] at the [[2019 Billboard Music Awards|26th ''Billboard'' Music Awards]]. Featured on [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']]'s international cover as \"Next Generation Leaders\", BTS has appeared in the magazine's 25 most influential people on the internet (2017\u20132019) and ''Time''<nowiki/>'s [[Time 100|100 most influential people in the world]] (2019), with the outlet giving them the nickname \"[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Princes of Pop]]\". ''[[Forbes Korea Power Celebrity|Forbes Korea]]'' named BTS the most influential celebrities of Korea in 2018, and BTS ranked 43rd in the [[Forbes Celebrity 100|''Forbes'' Celebrity 100]] (2019) as one of the world's top-earning celebrities. BTS are ranked #4 of [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']]'s Top Social Artist of the 2010s, and are the highest group on the list. During their [[Love Yourself World Tour]], BTS became the first Asian and first non-English speaking act to headline and sell out [[Wembley Stadium]]; and broke the record for the single highest-grossing engagement in [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl Stadium]] history. ''Billboard'' ranked BTS at #45 on their Top Touring Artists of the 2010s list, being the highest-ranked Asian as well as the only non-English speaking act on the list.

Originally a [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] group, their musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres. Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary, touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth, loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism. Their work features references to literature and psychological concepts and includes an [[Parallel universes in fiction|alternative universe]] storyline. The group have staged several world tours.\n\nThe group initially formed as teenagers under [[Big Hit Entertainment]] and released their debut single album, ''[[2 Cool 4 Skool]]'' (2013). Subsequent work such as their first U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] entries ''[[The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 2]]'' (2015), ''[[The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever]]'' (2016), and ''[[Wings (BTS album)|Wings]]'' (2016) helped establish BTS' reputation as a socially conscious group. ''Wings'' became BTS' first album to sell one million copies in South Korea. By 2017, BTS crossed into the international music market, leading the [[Korean Wave]] into the United States and breaking numerous sales records, becoming the first Korean group to receive a certification from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for their single \"[[Mic Drop (song)|Mic Drop]]\". The band is the first Korean act to top the ''Billboard'' 200 with their studio album ''[[Love Yourself: Tear]]'' (2018) and have since hit the top of the U.S. charts with their albums ''[[Love Yourself: Answer]]'' (2018), ''[[Map of the Soul: Persona]]'' (2019) and ''[[Map of the Soul: 7]]'' (2020), making BTS the fastest group since [[the Beatles]] to earn four number one albums in less than two years. ''Love Yourself: Answer'' also broke South Korea's [[Gaon Album Chart]]'s all-time monthly record previously set by ''Love Yourself: Tear'' and became the first Korean album certified Platinum in the United States.\n\nHaving sold over 20 million albums on the [[Gaon Music Chart]], BTS is the best-selling artist in South Korean history and holds the [[List of best-selling albums in South Korea|best-selling album in South Korea]] with ''Map of the Soul: 7''. BTS were the second best-selling artists of 2018 worldwide according to the [[IFPI]]'s Global Artist Chart, as well as the only non-English speaking artist to enter the chart. The group has won [[Billboard Music Award for Top Social Artist|Top Social Artist]] three years in a row and [[Billboard Music Award for Top Duo/Group|Top Duo/Group]] at the [[2019 Billboard Music Awards|26th ''Billboard'' Music Awards]]. Featured on [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']]'s international cover as \"Next Generation Leaders\", BTS has appeared in the magazine's 25 most influential people on the internet (2017\u20132019) and ''Time''<nowiki/>'s [[Time 100|100 most influential people in the world]] (2019), with the outlet giving them the nickname \"[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Princes of Pop]]\". ''[[Forbes Korea Power Celebrity|Forbes Korea]]'' named BTS the most influential celebrities of Korea in 2018, and BTS ranked 43rd in the [[Forbes Celebrity 100|''Forbes'' Celebrity 100]] (2019) as one of the world's top-earning celebrities. BTS are ranked #4 of [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']]'s Top Social Artist of the 2010s, and are the highest group on the list. During their [[Love Yourself World Tour]], BTS became the first Asian and first non-English speaking act to headline and sell out [[Wembley Stadium]]; and broke the record for the single highest-grossing engagement in [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl Stadium]] history. ''Billboard'' ranked BTS at #45 on their Top Touring Artists of the 2010s list, being the highest-ranked Asian as well as the only non-English speaking act on the list. As of 2019, BTS are purportedly worth more than $4.65 billion to South Korea's economy each year, or 0.3 percent of the country's GDP. BTS attracted one in every 13 foreign tourists that visited South Korea and were cited as one of the key acts boosting global music sales to $19 billion in 2018.\n\nFollowing the establishment of their [[Love Myself (campaign)|Love Myself]] anti-violence campaign in partnership with [[UNICEF]], BTS addressed the [[United Nations]] 73rd [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] and became the youngest ever recipients of the [[Order of Cultural Merit (Korea)|Order of Cultural Merit]] from the [[President of South Korea]] due to their contributions in spreading Korean culture and language.\n\n==Name==\nThe group's name, BTS, stands for the Korean expression ''Bangtan Sonyeondan'' ({{korean|hangul=\ubc29\ud0c4\uc18c\ub144\ub2e8|hanja={{linktext|\u9632\u5f48|\u5c11\u5e74|\u5718}}}}), literally meaning \"Bulletproof Boy Scouts\".

Located at an elevation of {{Convert|2710|ft|m}}, it began as a small mining camp soon after two prospectors struck a $10 million [[gold mining|gold]] find in 1915, though the vicinity had already been settled for a number of years. Oatman's population grew to more than 3,500 in the course of a year.\n\nOatman has the [[ZIP code]] 86433;<ref>[http://www.zipinfo.com/cgi-local/zipsrch.exe?cnty=cnty&zip=86433 Zip Code Lookup]</ref> the [[ZIP Code Tabulation Area|Tabulation Area]] had a population of 128 at the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]].<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=January 31, 2008 |title=U.S. Census website }}</ref>\n\n{{US Census population\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2016}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\nAfter a few other names were discarded, \"Oatman\" was chosen in honor of [[Olive Oatman]], a young Illinois girl who had been taken captive by a native tribe during her pioneer family's journey westward in 1851 and forced into slavery. She was later traded to [[Mohave people|Mohave]] people, who adopted her as a daughter and tattooed her face in the custom of the tribe. She was released in 1856 at [[Fort Yuma]], near present-day [[Yuma, Arizona|Yuma]].<ref>''The Blue Tattoo, the Life of Olive Oatman,'' by Margot Mifflin, 2009 {{ISBN|978-0803235175}}</ref>\n\nIn 1863, mountain man and prospector Johnny Moss discovered gold in the Black Mountains and staked several claims, one named the Moss, after himself, and another after Olive Oatman, whose story was by then well known. For the next half-century, mining waxed and waned in the remote district until new technology, reduced transportation costs, and new gold discoveries brought prosperity to Oatman in the early 20th century. The opening of the Tom Reed mine, followed by the discovery of an incredibly rich ore body in the nearby United Eastern Mining Company's property in 1915, brought one of the desert's last gold rushes. The boom of 1915-17 gave Oatman all the characters and characteristics of any gold rush [[boomtown]]. For about a decade, the mines of Oatman were among the largest gold producers in the American West.<ref>{{cite book|last=Paher|first=Stanley|title=Northwestern Arizona Ghost Towns|year=1980|publisher=Nevada Publications|location=Las Vegas|isbn=0-913814-30-X|pages=24\u201331}}</ref>\n\nIn 1921, a fire burned down many of Oatman's smaller buildings, but spared the Oatman Hotel. Built in 1902, the Oatman Hotel remains the oldest two-story adobe structure in Mohave County and a Mohave County historical landmark. It is especially famous as the honeymoon stop of [[Clark Gable]] and [[Carole Lombard]]<ref name=\"varney\">{{cite book|last=Varney|first=Philip|title=Arizona Ghost Towns and Mining Camps: A Travel Guide to History|editor=Stieve, Robert|publisher=Arizona Highways Books|location=Phoenix, Arizona|date=April 2005|edition=10th|pages=39|chapter=Mohave Ghosts|isbn=1-932082-46-8}}</ref> after their wedding in [[Kingman, Arizona|Kingman]] on March 18, 1939. Gable fell in love with the area and returned often to play poker with the miners. The Gable-Lombard honeymoon suite is one of the hotel's major attractions. The other is Oatie the ghost. Actively promoted by the hotel's current owners, Oatie is a friendly [[poltergeist]] whose identity is believed to be that of William Ray Flour, an Irish miner who died behind the hotel, presumably from excessive [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] consumption. Flour's body was not discovered until two days after his death, upon which it was hastily buried in a shallow grave near where he was found.\n\n===From gold mining to tourism===\n[[Image:Oatman girls.jpg|thumb|The Oatman girls, captives of the Indians, 1857]]\nIn 1924, United Eastern Mines, the town's main employer, permanently shut down its operations after producing $13,600,000 worth of gold ({{Inflation|US|13600000|1924|r=-3|fmt=eq}}) at the then-government-controlled market value of $20 per ounce. The district had produced $40 million ({{Inflation|US|40000000|1941|r=-3|fmt=eq}}) in gold by 1941, when the remainder of the town's gold mining operations were ordered shut down by the U.S. government as part of the country's war effort, since metals other than gold were needed. Oatman was fortunate in that it was located on busy [[U.S. Route 66 (Arizona)|U.S. Route 66]] and was able to cater to travelers driving between [[Kingman, Arizona|Kingman]] and [[Needles, California]]. Yet even that advantage was short-lived, as the town was completely bypassed in 1953 when a new route between Kingman and Needles was built.

Located at an elevation of {{Convert|2710|ft|m}}, it began as a small mining camp soon after two prospectors struck a $10 million [[gold mining|gold]] find in 1915, though the vicinity had already been settled for a number of years. Oatman's population grew to more than 3,500 in the course of a year.\n\nOatman has the [[ZIP code]] 86433;<ref>[http://www.zipinfo.com/cgi-local/zipsrch.exe?cnty=cnty&zip=86433 Zip Code Lookup]</ref> the [[ZIP Code Tabulation Area|Tabulation Area]] had a population of 128 at the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]].<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2008-01-31 |title=U.S. Census website }}</ref>\n\n{{US Census population\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2016}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Name==\nAfter a few other names were discarded, \"Oatman\" was chosen for the name of the town in honor of [[Olive Oatman]], a young Illinois girl who had been taken captive by Indians during her pioneer family's journey westward in 1851 and forced into slavery. She was later traded to [[Mohave people|Mohave]] Indians, who adopted her as a daughter and tattooed her face in the custom of the tribe. She was released in 1856 at [[Fort Yuma]] (near present-day [[Yuma, Arizona|Yuma]]).<ref>''The Blue Tattoo, the Life of Olive Oatman,'' by Margot Mifflin, 2009 {{ISBN|978-0803235175}}</ref>\n\n===History===\n====Early history====\n\nIn 1863, mountain man and prospector Johnny Moss discovered gold in the Black Mountains and staked several claims, one named the Moss, after himself, and another after Olive Oatman, whose story was by then well known. For the next half-century, mining waxed and waned in the remote district until new technology, reduced transportation costs, and new gold discoveries brought prosperity to Oatman in the early 20th century. The opening of the Tom Reed mine, followed by the discovery of an incredibly rich ore body in the nearby United Eastern Mining Company's property in 1915, brought one of the desert's last gold rushes. The boom of 1915-17 gave Oatman all the characters and characteristics of any gold rush [[boomtown]]. For about a decade, the mines of Oatman were among the largest gold producers in the American West.<ref>{{cite book|last=Paher|first=Stanley|title=Northwestern Arizona Ghost Towns|year=1980|publisher=Nevada Publications|location=Las Vegas|isbn=0-913814-30-X|pages=24\u201331}}</ref>\n\nIn 1921, a fire burned down many of Oatman's smaller buildings, but spared the Oatman Hotel. Built in 1902, the Oatman Hotel remains the oldest two-story adobe structure in Mohave County and a Mohave County historical landmark. It is especially famous as the honeymoon stop of [[Clark Gable]] and [[Carole Lombard]]<ref name=\"varney\">{{cite book|last=Varney|first=Philip|title=Arizona Ghost Towns and Mining Camps: A Travel Guide to History|editor=Stieve, Robert|publisher=Arizona Highways Books|location=Phoenix, Arizona|date=April 2005|edition=10th|pages=39|chapter=Mohave Ghosts|isbn=1-932082-46-8}}</ref> after their wedding in [[Kingman, Arizona|Kingman]] on 18 March 1939. Gable fell in love with the area and returned often to play poker with the miners. The Gable-Lombard honeymoon suite is one of the hotel's major attractions. The other is Oatie the ghost. Actively promoted by the hotel's current owners, Oatie is a friendly [[poltergeist]] whose identity is believed to be that of William Ray Flour, an Irish miner who died behind the hotel, presumably from excessive [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] consumption. Flour's body was not discovered until two days after his death, upon which it was hastily buried in a shallow grave near where he was found.\n\n===From gold mining to tourism===\n[[Image:Oatman girls.jpg|thumb|The Oatman girls, captives of the Indians, 1857]]\nIn 1924, United Eastern Mines, the town's main employer, permanently shut down its operations after producing $13,600,000 worth of gold ({{Inflation|US|13600000|1924|r=-3|fmt=eq}}) at the then-government-controlled market value of $20 per ounce. The district had produced $40 million ({{Inflation|US|40000000|1941|r=-3|fmt=eq}}) in gold by 1941, when the remainder of the town's gold mining operations were ordered shut down by the U.S. government as part of the country's war effort, since metals other than gold were needed. Oatman was fortunate in that it was located on busy [[U.S. Route 66 (Arizona)|U.S. Route 66]] and was able to cater to travelers driving between [[Kingman, Arizona|Kingman]] and [[Needles, California]]. Yet even that advantage was short-lived, as the town was completely bypassed in 1953 when a new route between Kingman and Needles was built. By the 1960s, Oatman was all but abandoned.\n\n===Modern town===\nOatman has favored tourism of Route 66 and the explosive growth of the nearby gaming town of [[Laughlin, Nevada]].\n\nOatman has a high desert climate, significantly cooler in both summer and winter than the [[Colorado River]] lowlands to the west.

[[Pan's People#People|Ruth Pearson]] performed as one of the dancers in this group throughout its run on the programme, retiring when the group was replaced.\n\nPan's People were succeeded by Ruby Flipper, a mixed-gender and mixed-race group, choreographed by Colby and managed by Pearson. This group's short run was terminated in October 1976. Different accounts of this group's demise are given - Colby's recollection of this time was \"[a BBC executive] called me in and said the British public didn\u2019t want to see black men dancing with white women...I argued, but he told me to form another all-girl group or I was out.\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Bruno/anthea|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2229442/Bruno-Anthea-NOT-propose-.html|accessdate=8 May 2017|publisher=MailOnline}}</ref> However, audience research by the producers also indicated Ruby Flipper were not popular amongst its TV audience.<ref>{{cite web|title=It's a tough life being a dancer -TOTP annual 1980|url=http://one-for-the-dads.979225.n3.nabble.com/Legs-Co-1976-79-tp4062428p3996248.html|publisher=BBC|accessdate=30 May 2017|page=42|quote=The BBC told me they had interviewed the audiences for Top of the Pops, and it was the audiences who said they disliked mixed groups}}</ref> Colby formed a new group, again managed by herself and Pearson, retaining the remaining three female dancers from Ruby Flipper and adding three new dancers following auditions. This replacement was the group that came to be known as Legs & Co.\n\nDue to improvements in the BBC archival process and the increase in off-air recordings from the mid-1970s, unlike the previous three groups, all performances at least partially survive with the vast bulk complete.\n\n==Legs & Co. on ''Top of the Pops''==\n\n===Initial line-up and name===\n\nThe three remaining female Ruby Flipper members were retained for the new group.

Occasionally, the rehearsing could begin the previous Friday.\n*'''Tuesday:''' Charts released. Either second day of rehearsal of the planned track, or a new track was selected if the prechosen one was no longer required for the show, and the new track was choreographed, staged, costumed and rehearsed. A new track was a common occurrence, once with 5 editions in a row requiring new tracks.<ref>{{cite web|title=Patches|url=http://one-for-the-dads.979225.n3.nabble.com/Legs-Co-1976-79-tp4062428p2910106.html}}</ref>\n*'''Wednesday:''' There was a non-costumed studio run through in the late morning with cameras (and band, if a band was involved). The full show dress rehearsal was done in the late afternoon in Television Centre. The performance itself was recorded with the studio audience in the evening. Normally it was done in two takes with close-ups in the second take. Due to the studio schedule, there was often no opportunity for further takes and so minor errors were often kept in the edited version.\n\nThe troupe could also rehearse for and perform up to three cabaret performances prior to the following Monday.\n\nBy 1981, Top of the Pops began going out live on occasion, with three live editions, 7 May 1981, 9 July 1981<ref>{{cite journal|title=Genome|issue=3008|pages=54|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/d8ee73ec08b149dca470715dad387952|journal=The Radio Times|accessdate=26 May 2017|date=1981-07-02}}</ref> and 3 September 1981<ref>{{cite web|title=Genome|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbcone/london/1981-09-03#at-19.15|website=BBC Genome|accessdate=26 May 2017}}</ref> including three performances on each date by Legs & Co.\n\n====Archive status====\nThe BBC only [[Top of the Pops#Missing episodes|holds in their library]] master tapes for all Top of the Pops episodes broadcast after 8 September 1977, with only partial coverage up to this date.

This group's short run was terminated in October 1976. Different accounts of this group's demise are given - Colby's recollection of this time was \"[a BBC executive] called me in and said the British public didn\u2019t want to see black men dancing with white women...I argued, but he told me to form another all-girl group or I was out.\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Bruno/anthea|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2229442/Bruno-Anthea-NOT-propose-.html|accessdate=8 May 2017|publisher=MailOnline}}</ref> However, audience research by the producers also indicated Ruby Flipper were not popular amongst its TV audience.<ref>{{cite web|title=It's a tough life being a dancer -TOTP annual 1980|url=http://one-for-the-dads.979225.n3.nabble.com/Legs-Co-1976-79-tp4062428p3996248.html|publisher=BBC|accessdate=30 May 2017|page=42|quote=The BBC told me they had interviewed the audiences for Top of the Pops, and it was the audiences who said they disliked mixed groups}}</ref> Colby formed a new group, again managed by herself and Pearson, retaining the remaining three female dancers from Ruby Flipper and adding three new dancers following auditions.

Occasionally, the rehearsing could begin the previous Friday.\n*'''Tuesday:''' Charts released. Either second day of rehearsal of the planned track, or a new track was selected if the prechosen one was no longer required for the show, and the new track was choreographed, staged, costumed and rehearsed.

The full show dress rehearsal was done in the late afternoon in Television Centre. The performance itself was recorded with the studio audience in the evening. Normally it was done in two takes with close-ups in the second take.

listed\n* The Pan's People Jungle Rock animal performers are assumed to be the dancers themselves therefore not indicated with 'Others'.\n* The Legs & Co Jungle Rock animal performers are listed though their professional status is unknown, they are listed as 'Others'\n* DJs are not listed where they appeared in a dance\n* Ruth Pearson's appearance on 'Harvest for the World' on 22 July 1976 is shown\n* The 'Others' are composed of the Ruth Pearson appearance, Legs & Co Jungle Rock performers, Floid Pearce in his Legs & Co performances and the uncredited males on 'Summer Nights'. \n* The uncredited Legs & Co. repeats of 31 December 1981 are shown\n\nThe full-height vertical lines indicate the last performance of each troupe.\n\n<timeline>\nImageSize = width:1000 height:auto
