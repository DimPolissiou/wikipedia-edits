(Some sources give his full middle name as \"Richie\".) He was born in [[Tilden, Nebraska]]. From his youth on a farm, he grew up to become a professional outfielder and veteran [[Broadcasting|broadcaster]] for the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] and one of the most beloved sports figures in [[Philadelphia]] history.

He sported a .308 lifetime [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]], leading the [[National League]] twice, and routinely led the league in [[fielding percentage]]. In 1950, in the last game of the regular season, he threw Dodgers' runner [[Cal Abrams]] out at home plate to preserve a 1\u20131 tie and set the stage for [[Dick Sisler]]'s pennant-clinching home run.

In his day he was regarded as the archetypal \"spray hitter\", stroking the ball equally well to all fields, thus making him harder to defend against.

He went on to anchor center field for the North Siders in 1960 and 1961. Anticipating a future career behind a microphone, Ashburn sometimes conducted a post-game baseball instruction clinic at [[Wrigley Field]] for the benefit of the youngsters in the [[WGN-TV]] viewing audience.\n\nAshburn was purchased by the expansion [[New York Mets]] for the 1962 season and was the first batter in franchise history. He had a good year offensively, batting .306, and was the team's first [[1962 Major League Baseball All-Star Game (first game)|All-Star Game]] representative. It was, however, a frustrating year for the polished professional, who had begun his career with a winner and found himself playing for the least successful team in modern baseball history (with a record of 40\u2013120). He retired at the end of the season.\n\nOne oft-told story is that on short flies to center or left-center, center fielder Ashburn would collide with shortstop [[Elio Chac\u00f3n]]. Chac\u00f3n, from [[Venezuela]], spoke little English and had difficulty understanding when Ashburn was calling him off the ball. To remedy matters teammate Joe Christopher taught Ashburn to say \"Yo la tengo\", Spanish for \"I\u2019ve got it.\" When Ashburn first used this phrase it worked fine, keeping Chac\u00f3n from running into him. But then left fielder [[Frank Thomas (outfielder)|Frank Thomas]], who did not speak a word of Spanish, slammed into Ashburn. After getting up Thomas asked Ashburn, \"What the heck is a Yellow Tango?\" This anecdote inspired the name of the American [[Indie rock|indie rock]] group [[Yo La Tengo]].\n\nIn his last five seasons, Ashburn played for the 8th-place Phillies, the 7th-place Cubs, and the 10th-place Mets. The infamous first-year Mets club won only a quarter of its games, and Ashburn decided to retire from active play. The last straw might have been during the Mets' 120th loss, when Ashburn was one of the three Mets victims in a [[triple play]] pulled off by his former teammates, the 9th-place Cubs. According to Jimmy Breslin, it was the prospect of sitting on the bench that led Ashburn to retire: \"He sat on the bench for a while with another team once and it bothered him badly. And he said that if he ever had to be a benchwarmer for the New York Mets he'd commit suicide.\"<ref>Breslin, Jimmy, Can't Anybody Here Play This Game? (The Viking Press, 1963), p. 54</ref>\n\nThroughout his playing career, Ashburn, who lived in his hometown of Tilden during the offseason, officiated high school basketball games throughout Nebraska as a way to stay in playing condition.  He became a well-respected official, but retired from officiating when he retired from baseball.\n\n==Post-career and death==\n[[File:PHI1997R38-01.jpg|thumb|left|150px|September 1997 Phillies jersey Ashburn memorial]]\nStarting in 1963, Ashburn became a radio and TV [[color commentator]] for the Phillies, his original big-league team. He first worked with long-time Phillies announcers [[Bill Campbell (sportscaster)|Bill Campbell]] and [[Byrum Saam]]. In 1971 Campbell was released by the Phillies and replaced by [[Harry Kalas]]. From 1971 to 1976, Ashburn worked together with Saam and Kalas who would both be [[Ford C. Frick Award]] winners. Saam retired in 1976, and Ashburn continued working with Kalas for the next two decades, the two growing to be best friends.  Kalas often referred to Ashburn as \"His Whiteness\", a nickname Kalas used for most of Ashburn's his life for the man he openly adored.<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Richie_Ashburn Baseball-Reference.com bio page on Ashburn, cites Kalas nickname] Retrieved 2010-08-06</ref>  \n\nAshburn regularly wrote for columns on the Phillies and Major League Baseball for ''[[The Philadelphia Bulletin]]'' and ''[[The Philadelphia Daily News]]''.\n\nAccording to Ashburn's mother, he planned to retire from broadcasting at the end of the 1997 season. On September 9, 1997 in New York City, after broadcasting the [[Mets\u2013Phillies rivalry|Phillies-Mets game]] at [[Shea Stadium]], Ashburn suffered a heart attack and died.<ref>{{cite news|quote=Mr. Ashburn, 70, had performed his normal duties during the Phillies' 13\u20134 win Monday night...Back in his room at midtown Manhattan's Grand Hyatt hotel, he contacted the Phillies' traveling secretary, Eddie Ferenz, and complained of chest pains.

On one occasion, he was talking to Harry Kalas about his superstitions during his playing days. He said that he once had a habit of keeping a successful baseball bat in bed with him between games, not trusting the clubhouse crew to give him the same bat the next day.  Ashburn told Kalas that he had \"slept with a lot of old bats\" in his day.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=3d7TouZUHIwC&pg=PA53&lpg=PA53&dq=richie+ashburn+old+bats&source=bl&ots=zUgK3y3S8E&sig=h7LiWGJExM5RnYP8VS0BLZONrcw&hl=en&ei=Mv0-TNGCCIH-8Abr_OisCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CBYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=richie%20ashburn%20old%20bats&f=false Book excerpt on Google.com] Retrieved July 15, 2010</ref>\n\nWhen calling late innings, Ashburn would occasionally ask on-air if the staff of Celebre's Pizza, a nearby pizzeria in [[South Philly]], was listening to the radio.  Pizza would then arrive at the radio booth 15\u201320 minutes later.  The Phillies requested that Ashburn discontinue the practice, as Celebre's was not a Phillies sponsor, and it was considered free advertising.\n\nAshburn was allowed to make on-air birthday and anniversary wishes during Phillies games.  To circumvent the Phillies' request, he started to say \"I'd like to send out a special birthday wish to the Celebre's twins \u2013 Plain & Pepperoni!\"<ref>[http://espn.go.com/classic/hof02/s/2002/0728/1411194.html ESPN.com article mentioning Celebre's Pizza] Retrieved 2010-08-05</ref> Harry Kalas was heard on radio in 2007 making a similar wish.\n\n[[Rub\u00e9n Amaro, Jr.]], former general manager of the Phillies and son and namesake of [[Rub\u00e9n Amaro, Sr.]], Phillies shortstop from the sixties and coach, co-founded the Richie Ashburn Foundation, which provides free baseball camp for 1,100 underprivileged children in the [[Delaware Valley]] and awards grants to area schools and colleges.\n\n[[Ted Williams]] gave Ashburn the nickname \"Putt-Putt\" because he \"ran so fast you would think he had twin motors in his pants\".

In his day he was regarded as the archetypal \"spray hitter\", stroking the ball equally well to all fields, thus making him harder to defend against. Ashburn accumulated the most hits (1,875) of any batter during the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/pi/bsl_finder.cgi#n1=&as=result_batter&offset=0&sum=1&min_year_season=1950&max_year_season=1959&isActive=either&isHOF=either&bats=any&throws=any&exactness=anypos&games_prop=50&games_tot=&pos_pitcher=1&pos_catcher=1&pos_first_base=1&pos_designated_hitter=1&pos_second_base=1&pos_third_base=1&pos_shortstop=1&pos_left_field=1&pos_center_field=1&pos_right_field=1&pos_out_field=1&qualifiersSeason=nomin&minpasValS=502&mingamesValS=100&qualifiersCareer=nomin&minpasValC=3000&mingamesValC=1000&c1val=0&c2val=0&c3val=0&c4val=0&min_season=1&max_season=-1&min_age=0&max_age=99&lg_ID=lgAny&lgAL_team=tmAny&lgNL_team=tmAny&lgFL_team=tmAny&lgAA_team=tmAny&lgPL_team=tmAny&lgUA_team=tmAny&lgNA_team=tmAny&orderby=H&layout=full&c1bsl=&c1gtlt=gt&c2bsl=&c2gtlt=gt&c3bsl=&c3gtlt=gt&c4bsl=&c4gtlt=gt&location=pob&locationMatch=is&pob=&pod=&pcanada=&pusa= |title=Batting Season Finder \u2013 Baseball-Reference PI |accessdate=2008-08-17 |work=[[Baseball-Reference.com]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509184939/http://www.baseball-reference.com/pi/bsl_finder.cgi#n1=&as=result_batter&offset=0&sum=1&min_year_season=1950&max_year_season=1959&isActive=either&isHOF=either&bats=any&throws=any&exactness=anypos&games_prop=50&games_tot=&pos_pitcher=1&pos_catcher=1&pos_first_base=1&pos_designated_hitter=1&pos_second_base=1&pos_third_base=1&pos_shortstop=1&pos_left_field=1&pos_center_field=1&pos_right_field=1&pos_out_field=1&qualifiersSeason=nomin&minpasValS=502&mingamesValS=100&qualifiersCareer=nomin&minpasValC=3000&mingamesValC=1000&c1val=0&c2val=0&c3val=0&c4val=0&min_season=1&max_season=-1&min_age=0&max_age=99&lg_ID=lgAny&lgAL_team=tmAny&lgNL_team=tmAny&lgFL_team=tmAny&lgAA_team=tmAny&lgPL_team=tmAny&lgUA_team=tmAny&lgNA_team=tmAny&orderby=H&layout=full&c1bsl=&c1gtlt=gt&c2bsl=&c2gtlt=gt&c3bsl=&c3gtlt=gt&c4bsl=&c4gtlt=gt&location=pob&locationMatch=is&pob=&pod=&pcanada=&pusa= |archivedate=May 9, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nDuring a game on August 17, 1957, Ashburn hit a foul ball into the stands that struck spectator Alice Roth, wife of ''[[Philadelphia Bulletin]]'' sports editor Earl Roth, breaking her nose.

He went on to anchor center field for the North Siders in 1960 and 1961. Anticipating a future career behind a microphone, Ashburn sometimes conducted a post-game baseball instruction clinic at [[Wrigley Field]] for the benefit of the youngsters in the [[WGN-TV]] viewing audience.\n\nAshburn was purchased by the expansion [[New York Mets]] for the 1962 season and was the first batter in franchise history. He had a good year offensively, batting .306, and was the team's first [[1962 Major League Baseball All-Star Game (first game)|All-Star Game]] representative. It was, however, a frustrating year for the polished professional, who had begun his career with a winner and found himself playing for the least successful team in modern baseball history (with a record of 40\u2013120). He retired at the end of the season.\n\nOne oft-told story is that on short flies to center or left-center, center fielder Ashburn would collide with shortstop [[Elio Chac\u00f3n]]. Chac\u00f3n, from [[Venezuela]], spoke little English and had difficulty understanding when Ashburn was calling him off the ball. To remedy matters teammate Joe Christopher taught Ashburn to say \"Yo la tengo\", Spanish for \"I\u2019ve got it.\" When Ashburn first used this phrase it worked fine, keeping Chac\u00f3n from running into him. But then left fielder [[Frank Thomas (outfielder)|Frank Thomas]], who did not speak a word of Spanish, slammed into Ashburn. After getting up Thomas asked Ashburn, \"What the heck is a Yellow Tango?\" This anecdote inspired the name of the American [[Indie rock|indie rock]] group [[Yo La Tengo]].\n\nIn his last five seasons, Ashburn played for the 8th-place Phillies, the 7th-place Cubs, and the 10th-place Mets. The infamous first-year Mets club won only a quarter of its games, and Ashburn decided to retire from active play. The last straw might have been during the Mets' 120th loss, when Ashburn was one of the three Mets victims in a [[triple play]] pulled off by his former teammates, the 9th-place Cubs. According to Jimmy Breslin, it was the prospect of sitting on the bench that led Ashburn to retire: \"He sat on the bench for a while with another team once and it bothered him badly. And he said that if he ever had to be a benchwarmer for the New York Mets he'd commit suicide.\"<ref>Breslin, Jimmy, Can't Anybody Here Play This Game? (The Viking Press, 1963), p. 54</ref>\n\nThroughout his playing career, Ashburn, who lived in his hometown of Tilden during the offseason, officiated high school basketball games throughout Nebraska as a way to stay in playing condition.  He became a well-respected official, but retired from officiating when he retired from baseball.\n\n==Post-career and death==\n[[File:PHI1997R38-01.jpg|thumb|left|150px|September 1997 Phillies jersey Ashburn memorial]]\nStarting in 1963, Ashburn became a radio and TV [[color commentator]] for the Phillies, his original big-league team. He first worked with long-time Phillies announcers [[Bill Campbell (sportscaster)|Bill Campbell]] and [[Byrum Saam]]. In 1971 Campbell was released by the Phillies and replaced by [[Harry Kalas]]. From 1971 to 1976, Ashburn worked together with Saam and Kalas who would both be [[Ford C. Frick Award]] winners. Saam retired in 1976, and Ashburn continued working with Kalas for the next two decades, the two growing to be best friends.  Kalas often referred to Ashburn as \"His Whiteness\", a nickname Kalas used for most of Ashburn's his life for the man he openly adored.<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Richie_Ashburn Baseball-Reference.com bio page on Ashburn, cites Kalas nickname] Retrieved 2010-08-06</ref>  \n\nAshburn regularly wrote for columns on the Phillies and Major League Baseball for the ''[[The Philadelphia Bulletin]]'' and ''[[The Philadelphia Daily News]]''.\n\nAccording to Ashburn's mother, he planned to retire from broadcasting at the end of the 1997 season. On September 9, 1997 in New York City, after broadcasting the [[Mets\u2013Phillies rivalry|Phillies-Mets game]] at [[Shea Stadium]], Ashburn suffered a heart attack and died.<ref>{{cite news|quote=Mr. Ashburn, 70, had performed his normal duties during the Phillies' 13\u20134 win Monday night...Back in his room at midtown Manhattan's Grand Hyatt hotel, he contacted the Phillies' traveling secretary, Eddie Ferenz, and complained of chest pains.

On one occasion, he was talking to Harry Kalas about his superstitions during his playing days. He said that he once had a habit of keeping a successful baseball bat in bed with him between games, not trusting the clubhouse crew to give him the same bat the next day.  Ashburn told Kalas that he had \"slept with a lot of old bats\" in his day.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=3d7TouZUHIwC&pg=PA53&lpg=PA53&dq=richie+ashburn+old+bats&source=bl&ots=zUgK3y3S8E&sig=h7LiWGJExM5RnYP8VS0BLZONrcw&hl=en&ei=Mv0-TNGCCIH-8Abr_OisCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CBYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=richie%20ashburn%20old%20bats&f=false Book excerpt on Google.com] Retrieved July 15, 2010</ref>\n\nWhen calling late innings, Ashburn would occasionally ask on-air if the staff of Celebre's Pizza, a nearby pizzeria in [[South Philly]], was listening to the radio.  Pizza would then arrive at the radio booth 15\u201320 minutes later.  The Phillies requested that Ashburn discontinue the practice, as Celebre's was not a Phillies sponsor, and it was considered free advertising.\n\nAshburn was allowed to make on-air birthday and anniversary wishes during Phillies games.  To circumvent the Phillies' request, he started to say \"I'd like to send out a special birthday wish to the Celebre's twins \u2013 Plain & Pepperoni!\"<ref>[http://espn.go.com/classic/hof02/s/2002/0728/1411194.html ESPN.com article mentioning Celebre's Pizza] Retrieved 2010-08-05</ref> Harry Kalas was heard on radio in 2007 making a similar wish.\n\n[[Rub\u00e9n Amaro, Jr.]], former general manager of the Phillies and son and namesake of [[Rub\u00e9n Amaro, Sr.]], Phillies shortstop from the sixties and coach, co-founded the Richie Ashburn Foundation, which provides free baseball camp for 1,100 underprivileged children in the [[Delaware Valley]] and awards grants to area schools and colleges.\n\n[[Ted Williams]] gave Ashburn the nickname \"Putt-Putt\" because he \"ran so fast you would think he had twin motors in his pants\".

Two-phase argues a single major environmental event\u2014such as the [[Saale glaciation]]\u2014caused European ''H. heidelbergensis'' to rapidly increase body size and robustness, as well as undergo an enlengthenment of the head (phase 1), which then led to other changes in skull anatomy (phase 2).<ref name=\"speciation\"/> However, Neanderthal anatomy may not have been driven entirely by adapting to cold weather.<ref name=stewart2019/> Accretion holds that Neanderthals slowly evolved over time from the ancestral ''H. heidelbergensis'', divided into 4 stages: early-pre-Neanderthals ([[Anglian stage|MIS 12]], [[Elster glaciation]]), pre-Neanderthals ''[[sensu lato]]'' (MIS [[Marine Isotope Stage 11|11]]\u2013[[Marine Isotope Stage 9|9]], [[Holstein interglacial]]), early Neanderthals (MIS 7\u2013[[Marine Isotope Stage 5|5]], [[Saale glaciation]]\u2013[[Eemian]]), and classic Neanderthals ''[[sensu stricto]]'' (MIS 4\u20133, [[W\u00fcrm glaciation]]).<ref name = \"Dean1998\"/>\n\nNumerous dates for the Neanderthal/human split have been suggested. The date of around 250 kya cites \"''[[Florisbad Skull|H. helmei]]''\" as being the last common ancestor (LCA), and the split is associated with the [[Levallois technique]] of making stone tools. The date of about 400 kya uses ''H. heidelbergensis'' as the LCA. 600 kya says that \"''[[Homo rhodesiensis|H. rhodesiensis]]''\" was the LCA, which split off into modern human lineage and a Neanderthal/''H. heidelbergensis'' lineage.<ref name=endicott/> 800 kya has ''[[Homo antecessor|H. antecessor]]'' as the LCA; however, different variations of this model would push the date back to 1 million years ago.<ref name=endicott/><ref name=meyer2016/> DNA studies have yielded various results on divergence time, such as 592\u2013182 kya,<ref name=stringer/> 553\u2013321 kya,<ref>{{cite journal|first=A.

However, individuals with the 129 variant of the [[PRNP]] gene were naturally immune to the prions. Studying this gene led to the discovery that the 129 variant was widespread among all modern humans, which could indicate widespread cannibalism at some point in human prehistory. Because Neanderthals are known to have practised cannibalism to an extent and to have co-existed with modern humans, British palaeoanthropologist Simon Underdown speculated that modern humans transmitted a kuru-like spongiform disease to Neanderthals, and, because the 129 variant appears to have been absent in Neanderthals, it quickly killed them off.<ref name=underdown2008>{{cite journal|first=S.|last=Underdown|year=2008|title=A potential role for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies in Neanderthal extinction|journal=Medical Hypotheses|volume=71|issue=1|pages=4\u20137|doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2007.12.014|pmid=18280671}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1= Bello |first1= S.

The most influential specimen was [[La Chapelle-aux-Saints 1]] from [[La Chapelle-aux-Saints]], France. French palaeontologist [[Marcellin Boule]] authored several publications, among the first to establish palaeontology as a science, detailing the specimen, but reconstructed it as ape-like and only remotely related to modern humans. The 1912 'discovery' of [[Piltdown Man]] (a hoax), appearing much more similar to modern humans than Neanderthals, was used as evidence that multiple different and unrelated branches of primitive humans existed, and supported Boule's reconstruction of ''H. neanderthalensis'' as a far distant relative and an [[evolutionary dead-end]].<ref name=boule>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/b22463355|first=M.|last=Boule|authorlink=Marcellin Boule|year=1911|title=L'homme fossile de La Chapelle-aux-Saints|trans-title=Fossil man from La Chapelle-aux-Saints|language=French|publisher=Masson|pages=[https://archive.org/details/b22463355/page/n16 1]\u201362}}</ref><ref name=drell2000/><ref name=Reybrouck2002>{{cite journal|first=D.|last=Van Reybrouck|authorlink=David Van Reybrouck|year=2002|title=Boule\u2019s error: on the social context of scientific knowledge|journal=Antiquity|volume=76|pages=158\u2013164}}</ref><ref name=Langdon2016/> He fueled the popular image of Neanderthals as barbarous, slouching, club-wielding primitives; this image was reproduced for several decades and popularised in [[science fiction]] works, such as the 1911 ''[[The Quest for Fire]]'' by [[J.-H.

Ideas such as Neanderthal behaviour, intelligence, and culture were being discussed, and a more humanlike image of them emerged. In 1939, American anthropologist [[Carlton Coon]] reconstructed a Neanderthal in a modern business suit and hat to emphasize that they would be, more or less, indistinguishable from modern humans had they survived into the present.

Two-phase argues a single major environmental event\u2014such as the [[Saale glaciation]]\u2014caused European ''H. heidelbergensis'' to rapidly increase body size and robustness, as well as undergo an enlengthenment of the head (phase 1), which then led to other changes in skull anatomy (phase 2).<ref name=\"speciation\"/> However, Neanderthal anatomy may not have been driven entirely by adapting to cold weather.<ref name=stewart2019/> Accretion holds that Neanderthals slowly evolved over time from the ancestral ''H. heidelbergensis'', divided into 4 stages: early-pre-Neanderthals ([[Anglian stage|MIS 12]], [[Elster glaciation]]), pre-Neanderthals ''[[sensu lato]]'' (MIS [[Marine Isotope Stage 11|11]]\u2013[[Marine Isotope Stage 9|9]], [[Holstein interglacial]]), early Neanderthals (MIS 7\u2013[[Marine Isotope Stage 5|5]], [[Saale glaciation]]\u2013[[Eemian]]), and classic Neanderthals ''[[sensu stricto]]'' (MIS 4\u20133, [[W\u00fcrm glaciation]]).<ref name = \"Dean1998\"/>\n\nNumerous dates for the Neanderthal/human split have been suggested. The date of around 250 kya cites \"''[[Florisbad Skull|H. helmei]]''\" as being the last common ancestor (LCA), and the split is associated with the [[Levallois technique]] of making stone tools. The date of about 400 kya uses ''H. heidelbergensis'' as the LCA. 600 kya says that \"''[[Homo rhodesiensis|H. rhodesiensis]]''\" was the LCA, which split off into modern human lineage and a Neanderthal/''H. heidelbergensis'' lineage.<ref name=endicott/> 800 kya has ''[[Homo antecessor|H. antecessor]]'' as the LCA; however, different variations of this model would push the date back to 1 million years ago.<ref name=endicott/><ref name=meyer2016/> DNA studies have yielded various results on divergence time, such as 592\u2013182 kya,<ref name=stringer/> 553\u2013321 kya,<ref>{{cite journal|first=A.

However, with modern hunter gatherers, the higher the meat dependency, the higher the division of labour.<ref name=hayden2012/> Further, tooth-wearing patterns in Neanderthal men and women suggest they commonly used their teeth for carrying items, but men exhibit more wearing on the upper teeth, and women the lower, suggesting some cultural differences in tasks.<ref>{{cite journal|first=A.|last=Estalrrich|first2=A.|last2=Rosas|year=2015|title=Division of labor by sex and age in Neandertals: an approach through the study of activity-related dental wear|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|volume=80|pages=51\u201363|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2014.07.007|pmid=25681013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Skeleton and restoration model of Neanderthal La Ferrassie 1.jpg|thumb|left|Skeleton and restoration model of [[La Ferrassie 1]] at the [[National Museum of Nature and Science]], Tokyo|alt=To the left is a skeleton and the right the reconstructed man, both holding long spears as a walking stick.

The Chancellor is the head of government and, according to the constitution, gives this title to one of the Federal Ministers, whom he or she thus designates as his or her deputy. This minister may fulfill the duties and use the powers of the Chancellor, if the Chancellor confers (parts of) them onto him (for example heading cabinet meetings, if the Chancellor is absent). If the Chancellor becomes unable to discharge his powers and duties, the Vice Chancellor becomes Acting Chancellor temporarily, either until the Chancellor is once again able to serve or until the [[Bundestag]] elects a new Chancellor (this has never happened up to now<ref>Ute Mager, in: von M\u00fcnch/Kunig: Grundgesetz-Kommentar II, 5. Auflage 2001, Rn. 10/11 zu Art. 69.</ref>).\n\nAlthough {{Lang|de|Stellvertreter}} is the constitutional term, most Germans know the Deputy by the expression '''Vice Chancellor''' ({{Lang|de|Vizekanzler}}). Chancellor ({{Lang|de|Kanzler}}) is the traditional term for the German head of government since 1867/71. A general deputy has been introduced only in 1878 by law ({{Lang|de|Stellvertretungsgesetz}}). In the [[Weimar Republic]] of 1919-1933, the office of {{Lang|de|Vizekanzler}} was mentioned in the internal reglement of the government. The current office or title exists since the constitution of 1949.\n\nThe 18th and current Vice Chancellor of Germany is [[Olaf Scholz]] ([[Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands|SPD]]). He was appointed by Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] ([[Christlich Demokratische Union|CDU]]) to the position on 14 March 2018 and also serves as the [[Federal Ministry of Finance (Germany)|Federal Minister of Finance]].\n\n== Office and appointment mechanism ==\nThe German cabinet consists of the Chancellor and the Federal Ministers. According to the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]] (Article 69.1), the Chancellor appoints one of the  [[Cabinet of Germany|ministers]] as Vice Chancellor. In contrast to the appointment of a cabinet minister, there is no need for a formal appointment by the President. The appointment is an exclusive power of the Chancellor.\n\nThe Chancellor is theoretically free to choose his or her deputy. Nevertheless, a German government is usually based on a coalition of two or more parties and the Chancellor gives the title to a minister of the second largest coalition party upon recommendation of that party's leadership. \n\nThe German Vice Chancellor can be regarded as the equivalent of a [[deputy prime minister]] in other parliamentary systems. A very important difference to e.g. the Vice President in presidential systems of government is that the German Vice Chancellor is not the automatic successor of a Chancellor suddenly leaving office. The Deputy is thought only as a replacement for the actual Chancellor. Should the Chancellor for example die, the [[President of Germany]] appoints one of the cabinet members (not necessarily, but most likely the Vice Chancellor) as Acting Chancellor until the parliament elects a new Chancellor.<ref>Georg Hermes, in: Horst Dreier (Hrsg.) Grundgesetz-Kommentar, Band 2, 2. Auflage 2006, Art. 69, Rn. 7, 17-19.</ref> When in 1974 Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]] resigned and refused to remain in office until his successor's election, President [[Gustav Heinemann]] ensured a corresponding precedent and appointed Vice Chancellor [[Walter Scheel]] as Acting Chancellor.\n\nThe Basic Law does not state, who shall perform the Chancellor's powers and duties, if both the Chancellor and the Vice Chancellor are unable to do so. The German cabinet's rules of procedure state that in absence of both office-holders cabinet meetings shall be chaired by a cabinet member designated for this purpose by either the Chancellor or the Vice Chancellor or, if such a designation has not taken place or if the designee is not able to do so, by the present cabinet member with the longest uninterrupted membership in the federal government (\u00a722.1).<ref>https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/themen/geschaeftsordnung-der-bundesregierung-459846</ref> It is however unclear, whether this provision extends to other powers of the office of Chancellor. In an expertise issued by the Bundestag's scientific service in 2014, the legal opinion is that this is the case.<ref>Wissenschaftlicher Dienst des Bundestages. Sachstand. Vertretungsregelungen f\u00fcr das Amt des Bundeskanzlers und des Bundespr\u00e4sidenten (AZ: WD 3-3000-016/14), p. 3\u20134.</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe office was initially established by the 1878 {{Lang|de|Stellvertretungsgesetz}} (Deputation Act), which provided for the Imperial Chancellor appointing a deputy, officially known as {{Lang|de|Allgemeiner Stellvertreter des Reichskanzlers}} (General Deputy to the Imperial Chancellor). In addition to the general deputy, who would be responsible for all the affairs of the Chancellor, the Chancellor could appoint deputies with limited responsibilities. The act was revised on 28 October 1918, when the possibility of appointing deputies with limited responsibilities was removed and the Vice-Chancellor was given the right to appear before parliament.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.documentarchiv.de/ksr/1878/reichskanzler-stellvertretung_ges.html|title=Gesetz, betreffend die Stellvertretung des Reichskanzlers [\"Stellvertretungsgesetz\"] (17.03.1878)|website=www.documentarchiv.de|language=German|access-date=2019-08-26}}</ref>\n\nIn the Weimar Republic, the office was considered less important and was usually held by the minister of justice or the interior. The most known office holder is Franz von Papen, a former Chancellor who formed a coalition government of national socialists and conservatives. Adolf Hitler became Chancellor, and Papen Vice Chancellor. It became soon obvious that the position of Vice Chancellor provided no powers and was unsuited to constrain Hitler.\n\nIn the Federal Republic (since 1949), the Chancellors have had no interest in allowing the Deputy to use the title for self promotion.<ref>Roman Herzog, in: Maunz/D\u00fcrig: Kommentar zum Grundgesetz, 2008, Art. 69, Rn. 9.</ref> Since 1966 it became customary that the coalition partner of the governing party received the ministry of the exterior who was also appointed Deputy. The ministry of the exterior was considered to be the most important cabinet post besides the Chancellorship. This tradition faded away in the time of Merkel's office, partially, because political heavyweights of the coalition partner chose a different ministry for personal preference.\n\n==Lists of Vice Chancellors==\n\n===German Empire (Allgemeiner Stellvertreter des Reichskanzlers)===\n'''Political Party:'''\n{{legend2|{{Free Conservative Party/meta/color}}|[[Free Conservative Party|FKP]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend2|{{Progressive People's Party (Germany)/meta/color}}|[[Progressive People's Party (Germany)|FVP]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! class=\"unsortable\" | #\n! class=\"unsortable\" | Portrait\n!

The Chancellor is the head of government and, according to the constitution, gives this title to one of the Federal Ministers, whom he or she thus designates as his or her deputy. This minister may fulfill the duties and use the powers of the Chancellor, if the Chancellor confers (parts of) them onto him (for example heading cabinet meetings, if the Chancellor is absent). If the Chancellor becomes unable to discharge his powers and duties, the Vice Chancellor becomes Acting Chancellor temporarily, either until the Chancellor is once again able to serve or until the [[Bundestag]] elects a new Chancellor (this has never happened up to now<ref>Ute Mager, in: von M\u00fcnch/Kunig: Grundgesetz-Kommentar II, 5. Auflage 2001, Rn. 10/11 zu Art. 69.</ref>).\n\nAlthough {{Lang|de|Stellvertreter}} is the constitutional term, most Germans know the Deputy by the expression '''Vice Chancellor''' ({{Lang|de|Vizekanzler}}). Chancellor ({{Lang|de|Kanzler}}) is the traditional term for the German head of government since 1867/71. A general deputy has been introduced only in 1878 by law ({{Lang|de|Stellvertretungsgesetz}}). In the [[Weimar Republic]] of 1919-1933, the office of {{Lang|de|Vizekanzler}} was mentioned in the internal reglement of the government. The current office or title exists since the constitution of 1949.\n\nThe 18th and current Vice Chancellor of Germany is [[Olaf Scholz]] ([[Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands|SPD]]). He was appointed by Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] ([[Christlich Demokratische Union|CDU]]) to the position on 14 March 2018 and also serves as the [[Federal Ministry of Finance (Germany)|Federal Minister of Finance]].\n\n== Office and appointment mechanism ==\nThe German cabinet consists of the Chancellor and the Federal Ministers. According to the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]] (Article 69.1), the Chancellor appoints one of the  [[Cabinet of Germany|ministers]] as Vice Chancellor. In contrast to the appointment of a cabinet minister, there is no need for a formal appointment by the President. The appointment is an exclusive power of the Chancellor.\n\nThe Chancellor is theoretically free to choose his or her deputy. Nevertheless, a German government is usually based on a coalition of two or more parties and the Chancellor gives the title to a minister of the second largest coalition party upon recommendation of that party's leadership. \n\nThe German Vice Chancellor can be regarded as the equivalent of a [[deputy prime minister]] in other parliamentary systems. A very important difference to e.g. the Vice President in presidential systems of government is that the German Vice Chancellor is not the automatic successor of a Chancellor suddenly leaving office. The Deputy is thought only as a replacement for the actual Chancellor. Should the Chancellor for example die, the [[President of Germany]] appoints one of the cabinet members (not necessarily, but most likely the Vice Chancellor) as Acting Chancellor until the parliament elects a new Chancellor.<ref>Georg Hermes, in: Horst Dreier (Hrsg.) Grundgesetz-Kommentar, Band 2, 2. Auflage 2006, Art. 69, Rn. 7, 17-19.</ref> When in 1974 Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]] resigned and refused to remain in office until his successor's election, President [[Gustav Heinemann]] ensured a corresponding precedent and appointed Vice Chancellor [[Walter Scheel]] as Acting Chancellor.\n\nThe Basic Law does not state, who shall perform the Chancellor's powers and duties, if both the Chancellor and the Vice Chancellor are unable to do so. The German cabinet's rules of procedure state that in absence of both office-holders cabinet meetings shall be chaired by a cabinet member designated for this purpose by either the Chancellor or the Vice Chancellor or, if such a designation has not taken place or if the designee is not able to do so, by the present cabinet member with the longest uninterrupted membership in the federal government (\u00a722.1).<ref>https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/themen/geschaeftsordnung-der-bundesregierung-459846</ref> It is however unclear, whether this provision extends to other powers of the office of Chancellor. In an expertise issued by the Bundestag's scientific service in 2014, the legal opinion is that this is the case.<ref>Wissenschaftlicher Dienst des Bundestages. Sachstand. Vertretungsregelungen f\u00fcr das Amt des Bundeskanzlers und des Bundespr\u00e4sidenten (AZ: WD 3-3000-016/14), p. 3\u20134.</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe office was initially established by the 1878 {{Lang|de|Stellvertretungsgesetz}} (Deputation Act), which provided for the Imperial Chancellor appointing a deputy, officially known as {{Lang|de|Allgemeiner Stellvertreter des Reichskanzlers}} (General Deputy to the Imperial Chancellor). In addition to the general deputy, who would be responsible for all the affairs of the Chancellor, the Chancellor could appoint deputies with limited responsibilities. The act was revised on 28 October 1918, when the possibility of appointing deputies with limited responsibilities was removed and the Vice-Chancellor was given the right to appear before parliament.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.documentarchiv.de/ksr/1878/reichskanzler-stellvertretung_ges.html|title=Gesetz, betreffend die Stellvertretung des Reichskanzlers [\"Stellvertretungsgesetz\"] (17.03.1878)|website=www.documentarchiv.de|language=German|access-date=2019-08-26}}</ref>\n\nIn the Weimar Republic, the office was considered less important and was usually held by the minister of justice or the interior. The most known office holder is Franz von Papen, a former Chancellor who formed a coalition government of national socialists and conservatives. Adolf Hitler became Chancellor, and Papen Vice Chancellor. It became soon obvious that the position of Vice Chancellor provided no powers and was unsuited to constrain Hitler.\n\nIn the Federal Republic (since 1949), the Chancellors have had no interest in allowing the Deputy to use the title for self promotion.<ref>Roman Herzog, in: Maunz/D\u00fcrig: Kommentar zum Grundgesetz, 2008, Art. 69, Rn. 9.</ref> Since 1966 it became customary that the coalition partner of the governing party received the ministry of the exterior who was also appointed Deputy. The ministry of the exterior was considered to be the most important cabinet post besides the Chancellorship. This tradition faded away in the time of Merkel's office, partially, because political heavyweights of the coalition partner chose a different ministry for personal preference.\n\n==Lists of Vice Chancellors==\n\n===German Empire (Allgemeiner Stellvertreter des Reichskanzlers)===\n'''Political Party:'''\n{{legend2|{{Free Conservative Party/meta/color}}|[[Free Conservative Party|FKP]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend2|{{Progressive People's Party (Germany)/meta/color}}|[[Progressive People's Party (Germany)|FVP]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! class=\"unsortable\" | #\n! class=\"unsortable\" | Portrait\n!

The conditions were calm enough to allow the crew to consider abandoning ship in a smaller boat kept aboard. When the ship started breaking up, the ship's papers were gathered and it was was abandoned.{{sfn|Shetland Times|1909}} The boat was directed to [[Muckle Roe]], where they were redirected to Olnafirth where the Norwegian Olna Whaling Station was based, to which they safely arrived.{{sfn|Orkney Herald|1909}}\n\nOn the same morning, a report from [[Sandness]] reached Divisional Officer Mr Rogers at [[Fort Charlotte, Shetland|Fort Charlotte]], [[Lerwick]] that the ship had wrecked.{{sfn|Shetland Times|1909}} He summoned the [[Northern Lighthouse Board|Northern Lighthouse Commissioners']] [[steamship]] ''Pole Star'' (which was leaving port) by [[Flag semaphore|semaphore]] to return and conveyed the report to the chief officer. ''Pole Star'' then proceeded to the Ve Skerries, where they found the ship waterlogged and abandoned. The ships' state indicated it had been quickly abandoned - [[The Orkney Herald]] reported that \"they found the sails merely clued up, but not stowed, the side lights burning, and a 24 hour alarm timepiece lying on the cabin table still going.\" They were able to retrieve more of the ship's papers still aboard the vessel, which were passed on to the [[Receiver of Wreck|Reciever of Wreck]] in [[Scalloway]]. The following day ''Pole Star'' learned the crew had arrived in Olnafirth while delivering supplies to Muckle Roe.{{sfn|Orkney Herald|1909}}\n\nSome of the ''Illeri'' crew (including the captain) visited the wreck again on Monday 6 May, however the ship was by then \"a total wreck\". The crew were forwarded on to Lerwick on Tuesday 7 May, and were then sent by the Norwegian Consul to Leith aboard SS ''Queen'' on Thursday 9 May''.{{sfn|Shetland Times|1909}}''\n\n===''Ben Doran''===\n{{Main|SS Ben Doran}}\nOn 29 March 1930, the [[Aberdeen]] [[Steamship|steam]] [[Fishing trawler|trawler]] [[SS Ben Doran|''Ben Doran'']] ran aground on the north end of Heligoblo{{sfn|Canmore - Ben Doran|}} in bad weather and rough sea conditions, due in part to poor coverage in nautical charts of the area, and lack of knowledge of the tides around the shallow reef surrounding the Ve Skerries which were considered unpredictable even to experienced Shetland fishermen. Another passing trawler brought news of the accident to [[Lerwick]] by 5pm,{{sfn|The Lifeboat|1930|p=66}} after which the [[Stromness]] Lifeboat Station in [[Orkney]] was notified, and [[Board of Trade|Board of Trade's]] life-saving apparatus - a rocket propelled rope to shoot to another vessel, to allow for it to be towed to safety{{sfn|SSVLB|}} - was arranged and taken by lorry to [[Ronas Voe]]. The apparatus was taken aboard the steam trawler ''Arora'' and it departed towards the Ve Skerries at 2am on 30 March.{{sfn|The Lifeboat|1930|p=66}}\n\nHonorary Secretary of the [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution|RNLI]]'s Lerwick branch, George Theodore Kay,{{sfn|Gott|2008}} who was aware of the geography of the Ve Skerries, thought that a ship the size of ''Arora'' would struggle to come close enough to ''Ben Doran'' to effect a rescue attempt. He learned that a smaller motor boat named ''Smiling Morn'' was berthed in [[Voe, Delting]], and suggested that this vessel accompanied by a four-oared rowing boat would have a better chance at success. He, with John Falconer, master of the trawler ''Boscobell'', and W. H. Dougall from [[The Mission to Seafarers|The Missions to Seamen]] proceeded to Voe and enrolled the assistance of ''Smiling Morn''.{{sfn|The Lifeboat|1930|p=66-67}} They headed for Housa Voe, [[Papa Stour]] to procure the expertise of someone there with experience of the seabed around the Ve Skerries. By entering Housa Voe in rough conditions and during the night, they themselves nearly collided with a sunken rock. Upon landfall in Housa Voe they enlisted the assistance of John Henderson, and headed towards the Ve Skerries.{{sfn|The Lifeboat|1930|p=67}}\n\n''Smiling Morn'' arrived before 5am at the Ve Skerries, which ''Arora'' had reached first. Heavy seas and high winds continued and proved to make a very difficult rescue attempt. Five of ''Ben Doran'''s crew were seen clinging to the ship's [[rigging]] while [[sea spray]] hit them. ''Arora'' made an approach, however they only reached in far enough that their crew thought that they would not be able to return to safety, and still ''Ben Doran'' was out of reach. Retreating, they relayed that an additional two crewmembers were spotted in the rigging. ''Ben Doran''<nowiki/>'s position in the middle of the skerries (being {{convert|600|yd|m}} west from the nearest skerry) meant there was no plausible means of rescue, owing to the shallow reef surrounding it. Kay, who examined the area 2 months later, commented that it was \"abundantly clear that rescue would have been hopeless.\"{{sfn|The Lifeboat|1930|p=67}}\n\nAt one point a \"tide lump\" ([[Shetland dialect]]: a rapid escalation of tidal activity){{sfn|Graham|2010b}} fell into the {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} rowing boat which ''Smiling Morn'' had in tow, and it sunk. ''Smiling Morn''{{'}}s skipper, John Jamieson, was adamant in attempting a rescue despite the danger to his own crew, and due to this a fight nearly broke out upon the ship, leading the rest of the crew to tie him up to keep him from doing so. Despite the effort put in by the crew of each of the would-be rescue vessels, they resolved that nothing more could be done and so they abandoned the rescue.{{sfn|The Lifeboat|1930|p=67}}\n[[File:In_Melby_Cemetery.jpg|alt=|thumb|Tombstones dedicated the crew of ''Ben Doran'' in the [[Melby, Shetland|Melby]] Cemetery]]\nThe Stromness Lifeboat Station was alerted to the unsuccessful attempt by 4pm 30 March. By 4:45pm the Stromness Lifeboat departed, reaching Scalloway by 7:30am on 31 March. By the time the lifeboat arrived at the Ve Skerries, only the gallows for supporting the ship's anchor could be seen.{{sfn|The Lifeboat|1930|p=69}} All of the nine crew members believed to have been on board were killed.{{sfn|Allen|2018}} The wrecking of ''Ben Doran'' and the deaths of the crew validated the need for a lifeboat to be stationed in Shetland. In 1933 the [[Aith]] Lifeboat Station was opened.{{sfn|RNLI|}}\n\nThe wreck of the ''Ben Doran'' is used as a dive site for sport divers and underwater photographers.{{sfn|Shetland.org|}}\n\n===''Elinor Viking''===\n{{Main|MFV Elinor Viking}}\nOn the 9th December 1977 [[MFV Elinor Viking|''Elinor Viking'']], an Aberdeen trawler was wrecked on the east side of Reaverack{{sfn|Canmore - Elinor Viking|}} due to extreme weather conditions. The Aith Lifeboat was sent to the scene, however due to the wreck's position it was not able to get close enough to the vessel to transfer to the crew to safety. Both of the ship's liferafts had been swept away by the sea, and the ship had been breached and lay half-filled with water. An appeal was made to [[Sumburgh Airport]] where [[British Airways]] had helicopters stationed, and a volunteer crew was assembled,{{sfn|Reardon Smith|1978}} including Captain George Bain as the chief pilot, and Major Alasdair Campbell as a [[Winch|winchman]].{{sfn|Telegraph|2012}}\n\nThey reached the scene within about an hour and, with the aid of another helicopter and an [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] [[Hawker Siddeley Nimrod|Nimrod]] trying to provide light in the dark conditions, they proceeded with the rescue attempt in horrendous weather. The light coming from dropped flares from the Nimrod was deemed impossible to time correctly with the winch lowering, such that their only effective source of light was the helicopter's landing lights. ''Elinor Viking'' had developed considerable list as it began to sink. Campbell, upon his first attempt being lowered down to the ship, was unexpectedly swayed and his cable became caught in the mast of the ship. The risk of losing the helicopter meant that the winch operator nearly took the decision to sever the cable to Campbell, however he was able to be retrieved back into the helicopter and immediately offered to be lowered again. Using a rock which was repeatedly out of view with the swell as the best reference, Bain was able to keep the aircraft steady to continue the rescue. Through the following hour and twenty minutes, lowering approximately twelve times, Campbell was able to hoist up the crew.{{sfn|London Gazette|1978|p=8046}} The last to leave the ship was the skipper, who (either through hypothermia or shock) could not let go of the ships railing, requiring Bain to hit him to continue the rescue.{{sfn|Telegraph|2012}}\n\nDespite the crew of the helicopter not being trained for rescue work, all 8 of ''Elinor Viking's'' crew were successfully winched to safety.{{sfn|Reardon Smith|1978}} Both Bain and Campbell received [[Queen's Gallantry Medal|Queen's Gallantry Medals]] for \"outstanding bravery, skill and determination in conditions of extreme weather and darkness operating in a situation far beyond that normally expected of a helicopter on rescue service.\"{{sfn|London Gazette|1978|p=8046}}\n\n===''Coelleira''===\n{{Main|MV Coelleira}}\n[[File:Coelleira wrecked on the Clubb, Ve Skerries pre salvage attempt.jpg|thumb|''Coelleira'' aground on the Clubb before the salvage attempt]]\nLate on 3 August 2019, the UK-registered, Spanish-owned fishing vessel [[MV Coelleira|''Coelleira'']] was returning to [[Scrabster]] from about {{Convert|18|nmi|km mi|abbr=}} north of [[Yell Sound]]'s entrance{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=2}} with a catch of approximately 15 tonnes of fish.{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=4}} Apart from the low light, the conditions were ideal - there was clear visibility, smooth seas and light winds. With the intention of returning as quickly as possible (due to unexpected delays in their fishing operations), the ship's mate set the vessel on a heading of 184\u00b0 and proceeded at a speed of {{convert|9|kn|km/h mph|abbr=}} to keep close to the coast in order to save time. At 21:42 the heading was set to 204\u00b0.{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=2}}\n\nAt 22:30 the skipper (a 56-year-old Spanish national){{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=7}} took over watch from the mate, who went to bed. The skipper over the next 2 hours made five adjustments to the ships' heading in order to follow the coast. The skipper during this time worked on fish landing records and other managerial work. It is not known how often the vessel's position was checked.{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=2}}\n\nAt 00:23 on 4 August, vessel was set to heading of 206\u00b0 with the aim of keeping around {{Convert|3.5|nmi|km mi|abbr=}} away from any navigational risk. The skipper did not see any hazards on the [[chartplotter]], and while he did see a [[lighthouse]] light towards the port bow, he assumed it was a lighthouse on the mainland.{{sfn|MAIB|2020}}\n\nAt an unspecified time, the skipper left the [[Bridge (nautical)|wheelhouse]], and (according to a [[Marine Accident Investigation Branch]] report) while the skipper was returning to his post at 01:24, ''Coelleira'' ran aground on the Clubb travelling at {{convert|10|kn|km/h mph|abbr=}}. The crew awoke with the sound of the collision, whereupon they assembled in the wheelhouse and donned [[Survival suit|survival suits]] and [[life jackets]]. Two lifeboats were launched off the starboard side.{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=2}} At 01:29 the Shetland [[Her Majesty's Coastguard|Coastguard]] were notified of the accident, and in response the [[Aith]] lifeboat and a rescue helicopter were sent to the scene. All 15{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=12}} crew were winched aboard the helicopter, and were returned to [[Lerwick]] uninjured.{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=4}}\n[[File:Coelleira wrecked on the Clubb, Ve Skerries post salvage attempt.jpg|left|thumb|''Coelleira'' on its port side after the salvage attempt]]\nAttempts were subsequently made to refloat the vessel. The ship was surveyed with assistance from the [[Sullom Voe Terminal]] tug ''Tystie'', however during the inspection the vessel rolled 5-10\u00b0 to port, at which point the men aboard were evacuated.{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=4-5}} The emergency towing vessel ''Ievoli Black'' attempted to pull ''Coelleira'' off the Clubb on 7 August, however during the attempt the ship tilted over 55\u00b0 to port, and with a forecast of poor sea conditions and weather the ship was deemed unsalvageable. In the following days the ship broke up and sank.{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=5}}\n\nIn its report on the incident, the [[Marine Accident Investigation Branch]] concluded that the planning of the passage between the fishing grounds and Scrabster was inadequate, the ship's position was not kept track of, and bridge was empty when the ship went aground. They posed that the skipper's decision making may have been impacted by fatigue, while the set up of the bridge's controls may have made it more difficult to observe risks to the ship.{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=1}}\n\n== Ve Skerries Lighthouse ==\n{{Infobox lighthouse\n| item = Q33061460\n| name = Ve Skerries lighthouse\n| image = \n| image_name = \n| caption = \n| location = Ve Skerries<br> [[Papa Stour]]<br> [[Shetland]]<br>[[Scotland]]<br>[[United Kingdom]]\n| pushpin_map = Scotland Shetland\n| relief = 1\n| pushpin_map_caption = Shetland\n| pushpin = lighthouse\n| coordinates = {{coord|60.373129|-1.812250|display=inline,title}}\n| yearbuilt = 1979\n| yearlit = \n| automated = 1979\n| yeardeactivated = \n| foundation = \n| construction = concrete tower\n| shape = cylindrical tower with double balcony and lantern\n| marking = white tower and lantern\n| height = {{convert|14.6|m|ft|0}}\n| focalheight = {{convert|17|m|ft|0}}\n| lens = \n| currentlens = \n| lightsource = batteries power\n| intensity = \n| range = {{convert|11|mi|km|0}}\n| characteristic = Fl (2) W20s.\n| fogsignal = \n| admiralty = A3847\n| NGA = 3556\n| ARLHS = SCO-253\n| managingagent = Northern Lighthouse Board{{sfn|Rowlett|}}\n{{sfn|NLB|2009}}\n}}\n\nThis modern lighthouse on the west side of Ormal was erected following the loss of ''Elinor Viking''. It replaced a lighted buoy itself put in place after the loss of ''Ben Doran.''{{sfn|Canmore|}} The tower is anchored to the rock with 18 steel bars. Built by engineer R. J. MacKay, it was first lit on 27 September 1979. It is not open to the public; its exposed location makes landings by sea difficult.{{sfn|NLB|2009}}\n\n== Folklore ==\nFollowing his tour of Shetland, [[Samuel Hibbert-Ware|Samuel Hibbert]] reported that the Ve Skerries were recounted by Shetlanders as being a retreat of the \"[[Haaf-fish]]\" (more commonly known as selkies) - creatures that would take the appearance of seal, but could take off their skins and would appear human, allowing them to fraternise on land.{{sfn|Hibbert|1822|p=567}} Because [[Seal hunting|seal clubbing]] was (in the past) practised, and because seals would tend to lie on the Ve Skerries, the islanders of [[Papa Stour]] would go there to hunt the seals for the purpose of retrieving their skins, and according to these tales, would sometimes end up hunting the selkies.{{sfn|Hibbert|1822|pp=596-567}}\n\nOne such tale attested that a seal hunter in a party of several, after killing and skinning several seals, was caught out by a sudden swell which caused the rest of the group to assemble in their boat, but left him stranded. Despite trying to rescue him, he had to be abandoned due to the worsening weather. Several selkies (in the form of seals) then landed on the Ve Skerries, took off their skins and proceeded to rescue those of their kind who had been clubbed, stunned and skinned by the hunters. Those who had been skinned began to regain consciousness, and expressed their sorrow over the loss of their only way to return home{{sfn|Hibbert|1822|p=568}} (each selkie only possessing a single skin).{{sfn|Hibbert|1822|p=566}} In particular, one selkie named Ollavitinus would not be able to return to his wives and would be imprisoned on land.{{sfn|Hibbert|1822|pp=568-569}} When the stranded hunter was spotted, Ollavitinus' mother Gioga offered to transport him back to Papa Stour as long as he would return her son's skin, which the hunter agreed to. With the weather worsening, the hunter feared he would not be able to hold on to the seal skin of Gioga all the way back, and pleaded to be allowed to cut holes in her skin to which he could hold, to which Gioga complied. The hunter was successfully transported to Akers Geo, Papa Stour, after which he dutifully retrieved Ollavitinus' skin from a skeo (Shetland dialect: a hut of loosely constructed stone for [[Food drying|wind-drying]] meat or fish){{sfn|Graham|2010a}} in Hamnavoe, allowing him to return to the sea and his wives.{{sfn|Hibbert|1822|p=569}}\n\n==See also==\n{{stack|{{Portal|Scottish Islands|Scotland|Engineering}}}}\n\n* [[Papa Stour]]\n* [[St Magnus Bay]]\n* [[Out Skerries]]\n* [[List of lighthouses in Scotland]]\n* [[List of Northern Lighthouse Board lighthouses]]\n* [[SV Illeri|SV ''Illeri'']]\n* [[SS Ben Doran|SS ''Ben Doran'']]\n* [[MFV Elinor Viking|MFV ''Elinor Viking'']]\n* [[MV Coelleira|MV ''Coelleira'']]\n* [[List of shipwrecks of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Selkie]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{Cite web|url=https://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?211405|title=FV Ben Doran (A178) (+1930)|last=Tony|first=Allen|date=2018-05-06|website=The Wrecksite|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-05|ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite Bayanne|access-date=2020-03-05|id=I108505|individual-first=George Theodore|individual-last=Kay|date=2008-03-02|year=2008|ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite web|url=https://www.shetlanddialect.org.uk/john-j-grahams-shetland-dictionary.php?word=2209|title=skeo|last=Graham|first=John J.|date=2010a|website=Shetland ForWirds|orig-year=1979|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-05|ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite web|url=https://www.shetlanddialect.org.uk/john-j-grahams-shetland-dictionary.php?word=2542|title=Tide-lumps|last=Graham|first=John J.|date=2010b|website=Shetland ForWirds|orig-year=1979|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-07|ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Hibbert|first=Samuel|url=https://archive.org/details/adescriptionshe00hibbgoog|title=A Description of the Shetland Islands, Comprising an Account of their Geology, Scenery, Antiquities, and Superstitions|publisher=Archibald Constable and Co|year=1822|isbn=|edition=1st|location=Edinburgh|pages=|ref=harv|author-link=Samuel Hibbert-Ware|via=archive.org}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Jakobsen|first=Jakob|url=https://archive.org/details/anetymodictofthenornlanginshet/|title=An etymological dictionary of the Norn language in Shetland|publisher=David Nutt (A.

The conditions were calm enough to allow the crew to consider abandoning ship in a smaller boat kept aboard. When the ship started breaking up, the ship's papers were gathered and it was was abandoned.{{sfn|Shetland Times|1909}} The boat was directed to [[Muckle Roe]], where they were redirected to Olnafirth where the Norwegian Olna Whaling Station was based, to which they safely arrived.{{sfn|Orkney Herald|1909}}\n\nOn the same morning, a report from [[Sandness]] reached Divisional Officer Mr Rogers at [[Fort Charlotte, Shetland|Fort Charlotte]], [[Lerwick]] that the ship had wrecked.{{sfn|Shetland Times|1909}} He summoned the [[Northern Lighthouse Board|Northern Lighthouse Commissioners']] [[steamship]] ''Pole Star'' (which was leaving port) by [[Flag semaphore|semaphore]] to return and conveyed the report to the chief officer. ''Pole Star'' then proceeded to the Ve Skerries, where they found the ship waterlogged and abandoned. The ships' state indicated it had been quickly abandoned - [[The Orkney Herald]] reported that \"they found the sails merely clued up, but not stowed, the side lights burning, and a 24 hour alarm timepiece lying on the cabin table still going.\" They were able to retrieve more of the ship's papers still aboard the vessel, which were passed on to the [[Receiver of Wreck|Reciever of Wreck]] in [[Scalloway]]. The following day ''Pole Star'' learned the crew had arrived in Olnafirth while delivering supplies to Muckle Roe.{{sfn|Orkney Herald|1909}}\n\nSome of the ''Illeri'' crew (including the captain) visited the wreck again on Monday 6 May, however the ship was by then \"a total wreck\". The crew were forwarded on to Lerwick on Tuesday 7 May, and were then sent by the Norwegian Consul to Leith aboard SS ''Queen'' on Thursday 9 May''.{{sfn|Shetland Times|1909}}''\n\n===''Ben Doran''===\n{{Main|SS Ben Doran}}\nOn 29 March 1930, the [[Aberdeen]] [[Steamship|steam]] [[Fishing trawler|trawler]] [[SS Ben Doran|''Ben Doran'']] ran aground on the north end of Heligoblo{{sfn|Canmore - Ben Doran|}} in bad weather and rough sea conditions, due in part to poor coverage in nautical charts of the area, and lack of knowledge of the tides around the shallow reef surrounding the Ve Skerries which were considered unpredictable even to experienced Shetland fishermen. Another passing trawler brought news of the accident to [[Lerwick]] by 5pm,{{sfn|The Lifeboat|1930|p=66}} after which the [[Stromness]] Lifeboat Station in [[Orkney]] was notified, and [[Board of Trade|Board of Trade's]] life-saving apparatus - a rocket propelled rope to shoot to another vessel, to allow for it to be towed to safety{{sfn|SSVLB|}} - was arranged and taken by lorry to [[Ronas Voe]]. The apparatus was taken aboard the steam trawler ''Arora'' and it departed towards the Ve Skerries at 2am on 30 March.{{sfn|The Lifeboat|1930|p=66}}\n\nHonorary Secretary of the [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution|RNLI]]'s Lerwick branch, George Theodore Kay,{{sfn|Gott|2008}} who was aware of the geography of the Ve Skerries, thought that a ship the size of ''Arora'' would struggle to come close enough to ''Ben Doran'' to effect a rescue attempt. He learned that a smaller motor boat named ''Smiling Morn'' was berthed in [[Voe, Delting]], and suggested that this vessel accompanied by a four-oared rowing boat would have a better chance at success. He, with John Falconer, master of the trawler ''Boscobell'', and W. H. Dougall from [[The Mission to Seafarers|The Missions to Seamen]] proceeded to Voe and enrolled the assistance of ''Smiling Morn''.{{sfn|The Lifeboat|1930|p=66-67}} They headed for Housa Voe, [[Papa Stour]] to procure the expertise of someone there with experience of the seabed around the Ve Skerries. By entering Housa Voe in rough conditions and during the night, they themselves nearly collided with a sunken rock. Upon landfall in Housa Voe they enlisted the assistance of John Henderson, and headed towards the Ve Skerries.{{sfn|The Lifeboat|1930|p=67}}\n\n''Smiling Morn'' arrived before 5am at the Ve Skerries, which ''Arora'' had reached first. Heavy seas and high winds continued and proved to make a very difficult rescue attempt. Five of ''Ben Doran'''s crew were seen clinging to the ship's [[rigging]] while [[sea spray]] hit them. ''Arora'' made an approach, however they only reached in far enough that their crew thought that they would not be able to return to safety, and still ''Ben Doran'' was out of reach. Retreating, they relayed that an additional two crewmembers were spotted in the rigging. ''Ben Doran''<nowiki/>'s position in the middle of the skerries (being {{convert|600|yd|m}} west from the nearest skerry) meant there was no plausible means of rescue, owing to the shallow reef surrounding it. Kay, who examined the area 2 months later, commented that it was \"abundantly clear that rescue would have been hopeless.\"{{sfn|The Lifeboat|1930|p=67}}\n\nAt one point a \"tide lump\" ([[Shetland dialect]]: a rapid escalation of tidal activity){{sfn|Graham|2010b}} fell into the {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} rowing boat which ''Smiling Morn'' had in tow, and it sunk. ''Smiling Morn''{{'}}s skipper, John Jamieson, was adamant in attempting a rescue despite the danger to his own crew, and due to this a fight nearly broke out upon the ship, leading the rest of the crew to tie him up to keep him from doing so. Despite the effort put in by the crew of each of the would-be rescue vessels, they resolved that nothing more could be done and so they abandoned the rescue.{{sfn|The Lifeboat|1930|p=67}}\n[[File:In_Melby_Cemetery.jpg|alt=|thumb|Tombstones dedicated the crew of ''Ben Doran'' in the [[Melby, Shetland|Melby]] Cemetery]]\nThe Stromness Lifeboat Station was alerted to the unsuccessful attempt by 4pm 30 March. By 4:45pm the Stromness Lifeboat departed, reaching Scalloway by 7:30am on 31 March. By the time the lifeboat arrived at the Ve Skerries, only the gallows for supporting the ship's anchor could be seen.{{sfn|The Lifeboat|1930|p=69}} All of the nine crew members believed to have been on board were killed.{{sfn|Allen|2018}} The wrecking of ''Ben Doran'' and the deaths of the crew validated the need for a lifeboat to be stationed in Shetland. In 1933 the [[Aith]] Lifeboat Station was opened.{{sfn|RNLI|}}\n\nThe wreck of the ''Ben Doran'' is used as a dive site for sport divers and underwater photographers.{{sfn|Shetland.org|}}\n\n===''Elinor Viking''===\n{{Main|MFV Elinor Viking}}\nOn the 9th December 1977 [[MFV Elinor Viking|''Elinor Viking'']], an Aberdeen trawler was wrecked on the east side of Reaverack{{sfn|Canmore - Elinor Viking|}} due to extreme weather conditions. The Aith Lifeboat was sent to the scene, however due to the wreck's position it was not able to get close enough to the vessel to transfer to the crew to safety. Both of the ship's liferafts had been swept away by the sea, and the ship had been breached and lay half-filled with water. An appeal was made to [[Sumburgh Airport]] where [[British Airways]] had helicopters stationed, and a volunteer crew was assembled,{{sfn|Reardon Smith|1978}} including Captain George Bain as the chief pilot, and Major Alasdair Campbell as a [[Winch|winchman]].{{sfn|Telegraph|2012}}\n\nThey reached the scene within about an hour and, with the aid of another helicopter and an [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] [[Hawker Siddeley Nimrod|Nimrod]] trying to provide light in the dark conditions, they proceeded with the rescue attempt in horrendous weather. The light coming from dropped flares from the Nimrod was deemed impossible to time correctly with the winch lowering, such that their only effective source of light was the helicopter's landing lights. ''Elinor Viking'' had developed considerable list as it began to sink. Campbell, upon his first attempt being lowered down to the ship, was unexpectedly swayed and his cable became caught in the mast of the ship. The risk of losing the helicopter meant that the winch operator nearly took the decision to sever the cable to Campbell, however he was able to be retrieved back into the helicopter and immediately offered to be lowered again. Using a rock which was repeatedly out of view with the swell as the best reference, Bain was able to keep the aircraft steady to continue the rescue. Through the following hour and twenty minutes, lowering approximately twelve times, Campbell was able to hoist up the crew.{{sfn|London Gazette|1978|p=8046}} The last to leave the ship was the skipper, who (either through hypothermia or shock) could not let go of the ships railing, requiring Bain to hit him to continue the rescue.{{sfn|Telegraph|2012}}\n\nDespite the crew of the helicopter not being trained for rescue work, all 8 of ''Elinor Viking's'' crew were successfully winched to safety.{{sfn|Reardon Smith|1978}} Both Bain and Campbell received [[Queen's Gallantry Medal|Queen's Gallantry Medals]] for \"outstanding bravery, skill and determination in conditions of extreme weather and darkness operating in a situation far beyond that normally expected of a helicopter on rescue service.\"{{sfn|London Gazette|1978|p=8046}}\n\n===''Coelleira''===\n{{Main|MV Coelleira}}\n[[File:Coelleira wrecked on the Clubb, Ve Skerries pre salvage attempt.jpg|thumb|''Coelleira'' aground on the Clubb before the salvage attempt]]\nLate on 3 August 2019, the UK-registered, Spanish-owned fishing vessel [[MV Coelleira|''Coelleira'']] was returning to [[Scrabster]] from about {{Convert|18|nmi|km mi|abbr=}} north of [[Yell Sound]]'s entrance{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=2}} with a catch of approximately 15 tonnes of fish.{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=4}} Apart from the low light, the conditions were ideal - there was clear visibility, smooth seas and light winds. With the intention of returning as quickly as possible (due to unexpected delays in their fishing operations), the ship's mate set the vessel on a heading of 184\u00b0 and proceeded at a speed of {{convert|9|kn|km/h mph|abbr=}} to keep close to the coast in order to save time. At 21:42 the heading was set to 204\u00b0.{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=2}}\n\nAt 22:30 the skipper (a 56-year-old Spanish national){{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=7}} took over watch from the mate, who went to bed. The skipper over the next 2 hours made five adjustments to the ships' heading in order to follow the coast. The skipper during this time worked on fish landing records and other managerial work. It is not known how often the vessel's position was checked.{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=2}}\n\nAt 00:23 on 4 August, vessel was set to heading of 206\u00b0 with the aim of keeping around {{Convert|3.5|nmi|km mi|abbr=}} away from any navigational risk. The skipper did not see any hazards on the [[chartplotter]], and while he did see a [[lighthouse]] light towards the port bow, he assumed it was a lighthouse on the mainland.{{sfn|MAIB|2020}}\n\nAt an unspecified time, the skipper left the [[Bridge (nautical)|wheelhouse]], and (according to a [[Marine Accident Investigation Branch]] report) while the skipper was returning to his post at 01:24, ''Coelleira'' ran aground on the Clubb travelling at {{convert|10|kn|km/h mph|abbr=}}. The crew awoke with the sound of the collision, whereupon they assembled in the wheelhouse and donned [[Survival suit|survival suits]] and [[life jackets]]. Two lifeboats were launched off the starboard side.{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=2}} At 01:29 the Shetland [[Her Majesty's Coastguard|Coastguard]] were notified of the accident, and in response the [[Aith]] lifeboat and a rescue helicopter were sent to the scene. All 15{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=12}} crew were winched aboard the helicopter, and were returned to [[Lerwick]] uninjured.{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=4}}\n[[File:Coelleira wrecked on the Clubb, Ve Skerries post salvage attempt.jpg|left|thumb|''Coelleira'' on its port side after the salvage attempt]]\nAttempts were subsequently made to refloat the vessel. The ship was surveyed with assistance from the [[Sullom Voe Terminal]] tug ''Tystie'', however during the inspection the vessel rolled 5-10\u00b0 to port, at which point the men aboard were evacuated.{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=4-5}} The emergency towing vessel ''Ievoli Black'' attempted to pull ''Coelleira'' off the Clubb on 7 August, however during the attempt the ship tilted over 55\u00b0 to port, and with a forecast of poor sea conditions and weather the ship was deemed unsalvageable. In the following days the ship broke up and sank.{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=5}}\n\nIn its report on the incident, the [[Marine Accident Investigation Branch]] concluded that the planning of the passage between the fishing grounds and Scrabster was inadequate, the ship's position was not kept track of, and bridge was empty when the ship went aground. They posed that the skipper's decision making may have been impacted by fatigue, while the set up of the bridge's controls may have made it more difficult to observe risks to the ship.{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=1}}\n\n== Ve Skerries Lighthouse ==\n{{Infobox lighthouse\n| item = Q33061460\n| name = Ve Skerries lighthouse\n| image = \n| image_name = \n| caption = \n| location = Ve Skerries<br> [[Papa Stour]]<br> [[Shetland]]<br>[[Scotland]]<br>[[United Kingdom]]\n| pushpin_map = Scotland Shetland\n| relief = 1\n| pushpin_map_caption = Shetland\n| pushpin = lighthouse\n| coordinates = {{coord|60.373129|-1.812250|display=inline,title}}\n| yearbuilt = 1979\n| yearlit = \n| automated = 1979\n| yeardeactivated = \n| foundation = \n| construction = concrete tower\n| shape = cylindrical tower with double balcony and lantern\n| marking = white tower and lantern\n| height = {{convert|14.6|m|ft|0}}\n| focalheight = {{convert|17|m|ft|0}}\n| lens = \n| currentlens = \n| lightsource = batteries power\n| intensity = \n| range = {{convert|11|mi|km|0}}\n| characteristic = Fl (2) W20s.\n| fogsignal = \n| admiralty = A3847\n| NGA = 3556\n| ARLHS = SCO-253\n| managingagent = Northern Lighthouse Board{{sfn|Rowlett|}}\n{{sfn|NLB|2009}}\n}}\n\nThis modern lighthouse on the west side of Ormal was erected following the loss of ''Elinor Viking''.

MacKay, it was first lit on 27 September 1979. It is not open to the public; its exposed location makes landings by sea difficult.{{sfn|NLB|2009}}\n\n== Folklore ==\nFollowing his tour of Shetland, [[Samuel Hibbert-Ware|Samuel Hibbert]] reported that the Ve Skerries were recounted by Shetlanders as being a retreat of the \"[[Haaf-fish]]\" (more commonly known as selkies) - creatures that would take the appearance of seal, but could take off their skins and would appear human, allowing them to fraternise on land.{{sfn|Hibbert|1822|p=567}} Because [[Seal hunting|seal clubbing]] was (in the past) practised, and because seals would tend to lie on the Ve Skerries, the islanders of [[Papa Stour]] would go there to hunt the seals for the purpose of retrieving their skins, and according to these tales, would sometimes end up hunting the selkies.{{sfn|Hibbert|1822|pp=596-567}}\n\nOne such tale attested that a seal hunter in a party of several, after killing and skinning several seals, was caught out by a sudden swell which caused the rest of the group to assemble in their boat, but left him stranded. Despite trying to rescue him, he had to be abandoned due to the worsening weather. Several selkies (in the form of seals) then landed on the Ve Skerries, took off their skins and proceeded to rescue those of their kind who had been clubbed, stunned and skinned by the hunters. Those who had been skinned began to regain consciousness, and expressed their sorrow over the loss of their only way to return home{{sfn|Hibbert|1822|p=568}} (each selkie only possessing a single skin).{{sfn|Hibbert|1822|p=566}} In particular, one selkie named Ollavitinus would not be able to return to his wives and would be imprisoned on land.{{sfn|Hibbert|1822|pp=568-569}} When the stranded hunter was spotted, Ollavitinus' mother Gioga offered to transport him back to Papa Stour as long as he would return her son's skin, which the hunter agreed to. With the weather worsening, the hunter feared he would not be able to hold on to the seal skin of Gioga all the way back, and pleaded to be allowed to cut holes in her skin to which he could hold, to which Gioga complied. The hunter was successfully transported to Akers Geo, Papa Stour, after which he dutifully retrieved Ollavitinus' skin from a skeo (Shetland dialect: a hut of loosely constructed stone for [[Food drying|wind-drying]] meat or fish){{sfn|Graham|2010a}} in Hamnavoe, allowing him to return to the sea and his wives.{{sfn|Hibbert|1822|p=569}}\n\n==See also==\n{{stack|{{Portal|Scottish Islands|Scotland|Engineering}}}}\n\n* [[Papa Stour]]\n* [[St Magnus Bay]]\n* [[Out Skerries]]\n* [[List of lighthouses in Scotland]]\n* [[List of Northern Lighthouse Board lighthouses]]\n* [[SV Illeri|SV ''Illeri'']]\n* [[SS Ben Doran|SS ''Ben Doran'']]\n* [[MFV Elinor Viking|MFV ''Elinor Viking'']]\n* [[MV Coelleira|MV ''Coelleira'']]\n* [[List of shipwrecks of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Selkie]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{Cite web|url=https://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?211405|title=FV Ben Doran (A178) (+1930)|last=Tony|first=Allen|date=2018-05-06|website=The Wrecksite|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-05|ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite Bayanne|access-date=2020-03-05|id=I108505|individual-first=George Theodore|individual-last=Kay|date=2008-03-02|year=2008|ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite web|url=https://www.shetlanddialect.org.uk/john-j-grahams-shetland-dictionary.php?word=2209|title=skeo|last=Graham|first=John J.|date=2010a|website=Shetland ForWirds|orig-year=1979|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-05|ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite web|url=https://www.shetlanddialect.org.uk/john-j-grahams-shetland-dictionary.php?word=2542|title=Tide-lumps|last=Graham|first=John J.|date=2010b|website=Shetland ForWirds|orig-year=1979|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-07|ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Hibbert|first=Samuel|url=https://archive.org/details/adescriptionshe00hibbgoog|title=A Description of the Shetland Islands, Comprising an Account of their Geology, Scenery, Antiquities, and Superstitions|publisher=Archibald Constable and Co|year=1822|isbn=|edition=1st|location=Edinburgh|pages=|ref=harv|author-link=Samuel Hibbert-Ware|via=archive.org}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Jakobsen|first=Jakob|url=https://archive.org/details/anetymodictofthenornlanginshet/|title=An etymological dictionary of the Norn language in Shetland|publisher=David Nutt (A.

''Peter Pan'' had first been shown live on TV by NBC in 1955, and been repeated (again live) by public demand in 1956. Its enormous success on television ushered in a temporary \"fad\" of mostly live family-oriented specials based on fantasy tales, such as ''[[Aladdin (1958 film)|Aladdin]]'' (1958, and no relation to the Disney film that came out 34 years later), ''Alice in Wonderland'' (1955) (a live-action version), [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s ''[[Cinderella (Rodgers and Hammerstein musical)|Cinderella]]'' (1957), ''[[The Pied Piper of Hamelin (1957 film)|The Pied Piper of Hamelin]]'' (1957), and ''[[Pinocchio (1957 TV program)|Pinocchio]]'' (1957, no relation to the Disney film). As part of this trend, CBS bought the rights from MGM to telecast ''The Wizard of Oz''.\n\nFor the first TV broadcast of ''The Wizard of Oz'', the normally 90-minute ''Ford Star Jubilee'' was expanded to a full two hours to accommodate the entire film, which, in addition to having commercial breaks, was celebrity [[Television presenter|hosted]]. The main reason that CBS arranged for a host for the film was that at 101-minutes, the film was not considered long enough to run in the allotted 120-minute slot at that time, even with commercial breaks, without additional content to pad the entire telecast out to two hours.<ref>''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', {{Clarify|page needed|date=December 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe 1956 television debut of the film marked the only time any actor who had appeared in the movie was selected to host the broadcast: [[Bert Lahr]], who played the Cowardly Lion (and his Kansas farmhand counterpart Zeke) in the film, appeared alongside the daughter of [[Judy Garland]], a then 10 year old [[Liza Minnelli]], and young Oz expert Justin G. Schiller. [[Lorna Luft]], Minnelli's half-sister, did not appear as she was only four years old at the time, although she did have her picture taken with Minnelli in a promotional photo. Unlike several of the other ''Oz'' telecasts, apparently no stills were taken during the hosting sequences in 1956.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone and William Stillman. ''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', Warner Books, 1989</ref> The practice of a show business celebrity regularly \"hosting\" ''The Wizard of Oz'' lasted from the film's first television showing until 1968, when the film went to NBC after being shown on CBS nine times.\n\nThe film was always presented uncut in a two-hour time slot between 1956 and 1968, despite having commercials and hosted segments. The Professor Marvel sequence has never been omitted (at least in American telecasts of the film),{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} and the tracking shot of [[Munchkinland]] was not edited until the film went to NBC in 1968.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nThe film's first broadcast received positive critical notices in newspapers the following day. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine prophetically suggested that the film could be telecast annually and at an earlier time.<ref name=VarReview/><ref>Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone and William Stillman. ''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', Warner Books, 1989, p.215</ref>\n\nThe film was a ratings success with a [[Nielsen rating]] of 33.9 and an audience share of 53%.<ref name=rating>{{cite magazine|title=Hit Movies on U.S. TV Since 1961|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=January 24, 1990|page=160}}</ref>\n\n==Telecasts in the pre-cable era==\nThe film was not rebroadcast in 1957 or 1958. For telecasts from 1959 (the year of its second telecast) up until 1998, the film was always shown as a stand-alone [[television special|TV special]] instead of as part of an anthology or movie series. Between 1959 and 1968, and again in 1990 when [[Angela Lansbury]], star of CBS' ''[[Murder She Wrote]]'', hosted the 50th-anniversary telecast, CBS chose its hosts from its then-current [[prime time]] lineup. In 1959, the host was [[Red Skelton]] (''[[The Red Skelton Show]]''); in 1960 it was [[Richard Boone]] (''[[Have Gun, Will Travel]]''), in 1961 and 1962 it was [[Dick Van Dyke]] (''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]''), and from 1964 through 1967, it was [[Danny Kaye]] (''[[The Danny Kaye Show]]''). Skelton, Boone and Van Dyke brought their then-young children along to appear with them.\n\nAlthough the hosting segments for the 1956 telecast of the film had to be done live, Skelton's, Boone's, Van Dyke's and Kaye's segments were recorded on [[video tape]] in advance of the telecasts.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C8wEHQAACAAJ&dq=The+Wizard+of+Oz:+50th+Anniversary+Celebration&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0VCqUb7EFofO9gTM1YGwBg&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA|title=The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History|first1=John|last1=Fricke|first2=Jay|last2=Scarfone|first3=William|last3=Stillman|date=11 September 1990|publisher=Grand Central Publishing|accessdate=11 September 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref> Lansbury's hosting segment was the first one recorded on film.\n\nDuring these years, the hosting sequences were not staged in a run-of-the-mill manner, with the host merely standing in a studio set, but in what could be considered imaginative ways. Richard Boone was taped on the set of his television series ''Have Gun, Will Travel'', in a \"living room\" with his real son about to watch the film on a TV set. Dick Van Dyke was shown in a living room set with his children,<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/> and Danny Kaye's hosting segment featured him sitting on a prop [[toadstool]] against a painted backdrop of the [[Yellow brick road|Yellow Brick Road]] and the [[Emerald City]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mrpopculture.com/files/html/jan19-1964/|title=Facts/History/Trivia/Music - Year In Review Video Timeline - 1955 Through 2013|website=www.mrpopculture.com|accessdate=11 September 2018}}</ref> The Kaye segment did not include a television set as part of its design.\n\nSome humor was sometimes incorporated into these segments. Red Skelton was seen as two characters: Before the film began, he was seen in a studio set of an early 20th-century bookstore, in costume as a [[Victorian fashion|Victorian]]-era storyteller who introduced [[L. Frank Baum]]'s original 1900 novel ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' to a young girl played by Skelton's real daughter, and at film's end, he appeared in a studio recreation of a modern living room as himself. Danny Kaye reassured viewers not to panic when the film began in black-and-white rather than in color, and encouraged young viewers not to be afraid of the roaring MGM lion at the beginning of the film. No directors or writers were credited for the hosting sequences, just as none are credited for hosting segments prior to films on Turner Classic Movies.\n\n''The Wizard of Oz'' did not become an annual television tradition immediately \u2014 only after the 1959 showing, when, because of the earlier hour at which it was shown (6:00 P.M., E.S.T.), more children tuned into the broadcast, and it gained an even larger television audience than before with a Nielsen rating of 36.5 and an audience share of 58%.<ref name=rating/> The 1959 telecast was especially welcomed by media critic [[John Crosby (media critic)|John Crosby]], who commented in the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', \"Television \u2014 any television \u2014 looks awfully ordinary after ''The Wizard of Oz''\".<ref>Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone. The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History, Warner Books, 1989</ref> From 1959 until 1991, the film was telecast once every year, the one exception being 1963, when it was not telecast at all.\n\n[[WISN-TV]] in [[Milwaukee]], Wisconsin, did not carry the network's yearly ''Oz'' telecast in 1961, the year WISN began its affiliation with CBS, running [[Green Bay Packers]] football instead. However, due to viewer outcry, WISN was able to get permission to run the film locally at 2:00&nbsp;p.m. C.S.T., on Christmas Eve.<ref>\"TV Screen,\" ''The Milwaukee Journal'', Milwaukee, Wisc., 24 December 1961, https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LzsaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=DCcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6142%2C1372025</ref>\n\nIn 1978, after the film had returned to CBS, a computer malfunction at the CBS owned-and-operated [[WBBM-TV]] in [[Chicago]] accidentally cut off most of the ending to that year's ''Oz'' telecast, interrupting the final minute with a commercial block that was not supposed to air until after the movie had ended.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Because the break was only 42 seconds long, no attempt was made to override the computer, for fear of making the problem worse.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} For several hours thereafter, WBBM received angry calls from viewers, while those unable to get through chose to voice their displeasure wrote to the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' newspapers.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n===\"Wraparound\" opening and closing credits===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\nThe film, as telecast on U.S. television between 1959 and 1968, was arguably given a much more elaborate TV presentation than it received afterwards. During those years, it always had videotaped wraparound [[opening credits|opening]] and [[closing credits]] segments devised by CBS, accompanied by the network's own specially recorded opening and closing music based on the film's score. For the opening \"wraparound\" credits, the title '''The Wizard of Oz''' and the names of its five leading actors, [[Judy Garland]], [[Frank Morgan]], [[Ray Bolger]], Bert Lahr, and [[Jack Haley]], were first shown in CBS's own format and [[font]], while an anonymous announcer read them off and then followed this with an announcement of the film's sponsor(s): \"This portion of ''The Wizard of Oz'' is brought to you by...[name of sponsor mentioned]\". These specially-devised opening credits never mentioned that the film was made by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. From 1959 to 1964, CBS created different wraparound credits for each showing, but because the same hosting segment \u2014 the Danny Kaye one \u2014 was shown between 1964 and 1968, audiences saw the same \"wraparound\" credits from 1964 until the film went to NBC.\n\nThe special CBS introduction was followed by the host speaking about the movie for about three minutes or so. Those remarks lead into the actual film, beginning with all of its original 1939 [[opening credits]] (shown against a background of moving clouds), including the MGM [[Leo the Lion (MGM)|Leo the Lion]] logo, the name of the film, the cast list, and the film's principal technical staff, exactly as MGM had created them, with the film's [[main title]] music heard.\n\nThe host reappeared just before the film's second half began, to say a few more words about it, before the telecast proceeded with the rest of the film, commercials included.\n\nHowever, at the end of the movie, the film's closing cast list, as created by MGM, was not be shown, and the title card with \"The End\" right after Dorothy's closing line was never seen on television during these early CBS showings. Instead, immediately after Dorothy spoke her last line (\"Oh, Auntie Em, there's no place like home!\"), and the camera faded out on her, television viewers once again saw CBS's own title card '''The Wizard of Oz''', this time accompanied by some of the film's end title music, exactly as heard on the [[soundtrack]], and the announcer's voice saying that the host for that year would return in a moment. After a final commercial, the host was then seen once again, to bid farewell to the TV audience, and CBS showed its own version of the cast list that appears during the film's end credits. At the end, referring to both the film and the hosting segments, the same announcer declared that \"This has been a film and videotape presentation.\"\n\n===Shown in color===\nFrom the beginning ''The Wizard of Oz'' was telecast in color, although few people owned [[color television]] sets in 1956.  Except for 1961, all U.S. telecasts have been in color, an effect that seemed much more striking in the early 1960s, when there were still relatively few color programs on television. It was not televised in color in 1961 because color telecasts had to be paid for by their sponsors, who declined to do so that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mrpopculture.com/files/html/dec08-1961/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-14 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426051707/http://www.mrpopculture.com/files/html/dec08-1961/ |archivedate=2012-04-26 |df= }}</ref><ref>Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone. ''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', Warner Books, 1989, p. 214.</ref> Between 1956 and 1965, the ''Wizard of Oz'' showings were rare exceptions to the black and white program schedule at CBS. During this period, CBS had the ability to broadcast programs in color, but generally chose not to do so unless a sponsor paid for a film or program to be shown in color. During this period, the competing network NBC was owned by [[RCA]], which by 1960 manufactured 95% of the color sets sold in the U.S. Hence, CBS perceived that increased use of color broadcasting would primarily benefit its rival by promoting sales of RCA color television sets.{{Citation needed|reason=According to Steve Hoffman's website, the main reason the CBS did few color telecasts until 1965 is because their initial color broadcasting system was rejected by the Federal Communications Commission in the early 1950s.  A source to back up this claim as a reason should be provided.|date=August 2019}}\n\nNot until the fall of 1965 did color broadcasts play a major role at CBS and ABC, at which time half the network shows from ABC and CBS were being made and shown in color. Meanwhile, all but two NBC prime time shows were in color and most of NBC's daytime shows were. By the fall of 1966, all three networks produced all of their prime time shows in color. By the time the movie went to NBC in 1968, all network shows (except for reruns of black and white movies) were in color.\n\n===Later hosts===\n{{More citations needed|section, except for one footnote, |date=June 2013}}\nPartly because commercial time during programs increased beginning in the late 1960s, the idea of regularly having hosts to introduce the film was dropped when ''The Wizard of Oz'' went to [[NBC]] in 1968, where no \"wraparound\" sequence was shown. The presentation consisted only of the film itself, with its original opening and closing credits, and no special NBC-created credits or hosting segments. The famous [[NBC peacock]] was shown immediately prior to the beginning of the film, with announcer [[Mel Brandt]] saying that \"the first 22 minutes of this program [i.e. the Kansas and tornado sequences] will be shown in black-and-white\", a not quite accurate statement, since the final three minutes of the film also took place in Kansas, and were at that time also shown in black-and-white, rather than in the [[sepia tone]] in which they originally had been made (the sepia was not restored to the Kansas and tornado scenes until 1989, the film's 50th anniversary). However, one NBC telecast featured an on-screen host: the 1970 showing, which opened with veteran actor [[Gregory Peck]] paying tribute to the recently deceased Judy Garland (a segment directed by ''Oz'' producer [[Mervyn LeRoy]], marking his first TV work), although this segment consisted of only a few brief remarks, while the opening hosting segments on CBS had gone on for about three minutes or so. The NBC ''Oz'' telecasts began the tradition of the film's annual showings during the [[Easter]] and [[Passover]] seasons of the year as opposed to the winter showings on [[CBS]].\n\nThe switch in networks resulted because CBS was unwilling to meet MGM's increased price \u2014 fostered by the film's ever increasing popularity \u2014 for renewal of the rights to telecast it.<ref>Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone and William Stillman. \"The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History\", Warner Books, 1989.</ref>  The film stayed on NBC until 1976. When CBS, realizing its error in allowing it to go to another network, bought back the rights at MGM's asking price, their viewer ratings shot up, and one executive was heard to remark, \"That picture is better [for the network] than a gushing oil well\".<ref>http://www.docstoc.com/docs/8043642/New-book-sell-sheet</ref>\n\nAfter its 1976 return to CBS, the film was hosted on that network only once more, in a filmed segment featuring Angela Lansbury in 1990, but the CBS \"wraparound\" opening and closing credits were not - and have never been - revived, although, during those years, a blue card featuring a painting of a rainbow and the title '''The Wizard of Oz''' ''was'' shown on the screen while the night's pre-empted programs or programs to be shown at regular time and the sponsors were being announced, and immediately before and after commercial breaks. In the 1980s clips from the film shown on a red background with title was shown at the start, while a still of Emerald City with title was used during commercials. Angela Lansbury also narrated a documentary about the making of the film, originally entitled ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: 50 Years of Magic'' and years later re-titled ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: The Making of a Movie Classic''. It was first shown immediately after the movie's 1990 telecast, and is included as a supplement on all the DVD releases beginning with the 1999 DVD release. [[Jack Haley, Jr.]], the documentary's director, was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] for his work.\n\nWhen shown on Turner Classic Movies, ''The Wizard of Oz'' was usually hosted by TCM host [[Robert Osborne]].\n\nOn June 3, 2007, [[Tom Kenny]], the voice of [[SpongeBob SquarePants]], hosted a telecast of the film on Turner Classic Movies, as part of ''Essentials, Jr.'', a special summer series of family movies.\n\nOn July 27, 2008, the film was shown twice in a row on [[Turner Network Television]] without a host, but with commercials, and with \"pop-up\" animated ads for other TNT programs at the bottom of the screen just before and after commercial breaks.\n\nOn March 24 and 25, 2012, the film was hosted on Cartoon Network by television actor [[Robert Wu]], who provides the voice of Mr. Washee Washee in the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode, \"[[Tiegs for Two]]\". This telecast ran two-and-a-half hours, longer than any CBS or NBC telecasts.\n\nOn June 10, 2012, which would have been Judy Garland's 90th birthday, the film was telecast on Turner Classic Movies without commercials, and hosted by comedian [[Bill Hader]], again as part of the ''Essentials, Jr.'' summer series of family films. Unlike the CBS hosting segments which were a part of the 1960s telecasts of the film, Hader's segment showed clips from the film before it actually began.\n\n===Sponsorship===\nBeing a presentation of network TV, ''The Wizard of Oz'' was subject to sponsorship from a variety of advertisers.\n\nThe first telecast of \"Oz\" was a presentation of [[Ford Star Jubilee]] and thus sponsored by [[Ford Motor Company]] and its dealers. In the ensuing years of 1959 thru 1967, the yearly telecast was sponsored by one primary sponsor with a co-sponsor. Perhaps the best remembered examples were the telecasts sponsored by [[Procter and Gamble]] and promoted when the company gave free premiums of hand puppets with packages of some of its most popular products. Many also remember the 1970 telecast presented on NBC by [[Singer Manufacturing Company]] as a tribute to Judy Garland, who had died in June 1969.\n\nIn later years, several different advertisers shared sponsorship; no one advertiser predominated.\n\n===Television ratings===\nThe showing in 1983 was the 25th network prime-time showing, a record then for any film or television special.  In the first nine showings, all on CBS, ''The Wizard of Oz'' gained at least 49% of the television audience.<ref>Harmetz, Aljean \"'Wizard of Oz': A TV Success Story,\" ''New York Times'', March 16, 1983. pg.

When CBS bought the film back from NBC in 1976, it again began to beat episodes of Disney in the ratings. It preempted Disney on one more occasion, after the series moved to that network in the early 1980s.<ref>http://getty.net/texts/tv-67-83.txt</ref>\n\nIn 2006, the first year it was shown on TV in [[high-definition television|high-definition]], the film placed No. 11 in the Nielsen ratings among cable television programs for the week of November 11.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wrestlingclique.com/entertainment/14907-extended-nielsen-ratings-nov-6-12-a.html|title=Extended Nielsen Ratings for Nov 6-12|website=wrestlingclique.com|accessdate=11 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Changes made in running time===\nFrom 1968 to 1984, minor cuts were made to the film to make room for added commercial time and in order to have the film \"clock in\" at two hours. No dialogue or singing was removed, only moments such as camera pans and establishing shots, as well as MGM's written [[foreword]] to the film.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\nOn a few occasions beginning in 1985, again because of the increased time spent on commercial breaks, the film was time-compressed to fit it into a two-hour running time without cutting it.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> However, ''The Wizard of Oz'' is now always shown complete and at its regular speed on television, both with and without commercials. When shown with ads, the film now runs about two hours and fifteen minutes, simply because of the increase in commercial time.\n\n===March 1991 showing===\nThe March 1991 showing was the first after the film gained protected status from the Library of Congress and the National Film Preservation Board. Networks opted to no longer shorten the film by \"microcutting\" a few individual moments throughout the movie as had been done from the late 1960s to the early 1980s to make room for commercials and keep it in a two-hour broadcast. This extended the running time of the film from 8 P.M to 10:07&nbsp;p.m. and sometimes even longer, depending on the amount of time spent on commercials. It was one of the first 50 films selected for this protection.<ref>Glenn Collins, \"A Full-Length 'Oz' for TV.\" ''New York Times''. New York, N.Y.: March 19, 1991, p.

Because both films were still licensed to CBS, Turner and the network negotiated a deal that extended CBS' license for ''Oz'' in exchange for relinquishing its rights to ''Gone with the Wind''.<ref name=TCMnotes>{{cite web | url = http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/852/The-Wizard-of-Oz/notes.html | title= ''The Wizard of Oz'' (1939): Notes | publisher = [[Turner Classic Movies|TCM]] | accessdate= 2014-02-08}}</ref> In 1991, the film was shown twice during the year for the first time.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} 1991 also marked the first time since 1956 that the film was shown in November. This also happened in 1993, when the film was telecast in both February and November of that year. The film was not shown on television at all in 1992, 1995 and 1997, marking the first time since 1963 that a year was skipped in showings of the film. Turner, which owned most of the pre-May 1986 MGM film and television library at the time (later owned by Warner Bros.), began moving to make its properties exclusive to Turner-owned outlets in the late 1990s; as such, in 1998, ''The Wizard of Oz'' made its last appearance on CBS, moving exclusively to Turner-owned properties the next year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/1998/tv/news/wizard-travels-to-tbs-1117469508/|title=\u2018Wizard\u2019 travels to TBS|last=Kissell|first=Rick|date=1998-04-06|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-30}}</ref>\n\n2000 marked the first time that the film was shown on U.S. television during the summer. In 2002, it was shown five times.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nOn November 6, 2011, TBS became the American television channel on which ''The Wizard of Oz'' has been shown most often, when the film had its 32nd showing on that channel, finally breaking CBS' record 31 showings. As of April 29, 2013, Turner Classic Movies has shown the film 23 times.\n\n===Differences between network and cable showings===\nIn addition to the frequent cable showings, another difference between showings on NBC, CBS, the WB network, and cable channels is that when the film was shown on CBS and NBC, it was always presented as a special instead of just a televised film. From 1959 until it went to cable, the film was never shown on [[NBC Saturday Night at the Movies]] or any other movie anthology series, and telecasts of the film regularly preempted two hours or more of regular television programming.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\nPromos for the CBS and NBC showings during the 1960s began airing on television as much as two weeks in advance of that year's telecast and were still airing as late as 1989.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}  On the major commercial networks, it was never termed a \"CBS Movie Special\" or an \"NBC Movie Special\", as movie specials shown on those networks are frequently termed, but as simply ''The Wizard of Oz''.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n===Aspect ratio===\nThe 1955 and 1998 theatrical re-releases were matted in movie theaters to produce a widescreen effect for the [[Aspect ratio (image)#Cinema terminology|Academy-standard]] [[aspect-ratio]] film.\n\nWhen shown in [[HDTV]], the film is [[pillarbox]]ed so that its aspect ratio is preserved.<ref>http://www.dtvforum.info/index.php?showtopic=43204</ref> On DVD, the film has always been issued in its original 1939 aspect ratio.<ref name=\"dvdtalk.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/39772/wizard-of-oz-the/|title=The Wizard of Oz (Blu-ray)|website=DVD Talk|accessdate=11 September 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"dvdtalk.com\"/><ref>http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/wizardozse.php</ref>\n\n==Outside the United States==\nThe movie has also been shown on television successfully in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]] and is shown every year in [[Australia]], but it has not become the television phenomenon there that it has in the U.S.<ref>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Website</ref> In Indonesia, the film was aired for the first time on the newly-inaugurated television network [[RCTI]] in November 1989, with reruns on other four networks in the 1990s.

It was shown in color although very few people owned color TV sets. This marked the only time it was ever aired that late on a non-cable television network (Turner Broadcasting frequently schedules two showings in a row on the same night, at 8:00 p.m. and 10:15 p.m.). Future showings began earlier in order to allow children to see it more easily. In addition, the prime time hour generally given to affiliates for local programming was taken back in order to run the movie early. This practice continued until the film was sold to NBC.\n*1959 - CBS - Sunday, December 13 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\n::The first of the film's annual showings.

For whatever reason, the movie continued to air early in the year rather than late in the year from 1964 until the 1990s.\n*1965 - CBS - Sunday, January 17 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1966 - CBS - Sunday, January 9 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1967 - CBS - Sunday, February 12 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\nLast airing on CBS until 1976.

It remained there for twenty-two more years, a likely record in those years for a film's consecutive showings on one network. Initially the movie aired late winter/early spring, but beginning in 1991, the movie moved back and forth from spring to late fall. Another change was that CBS no longer began the movie before normal prime time. Before 1976, when run on a day other than Sunday, NBC took back the 7 p.m. Eastern / 6 p.m. Central time slots from affiliates to run the movie early enough so children could see it before bedtime. Also, prior to 1968, CBS always took the 6 p.m. hour to run the movie early. Logic was that times have changed and children now stay up a little later than they did in the past. From then on, if shown in a Sunday 6 to 8 or 7 to 9 pm time slot on CBS, the film preempted ''60 Minutes'', so beginning in 1978, CBS executives moved the showings to other nights of the week. If the film was shown on a Sunday, CBS usually scheduled it at 8 pm, so that it did not conflict with ''60 Minutes''. (As of 2017, ''60 Minutes'' continues to air in the same Sunday 7 p.m. time slot on CBS.)\n*1977 - CBS - Sunday, March 20 - 7 p.m.\n*1978 - CBS - Easter Sunday, March 26 - 7 p.m.\n*1979 - CBS - Friday, March 23 - 8 p.m.\n*1980 - CBS - Friday, March 7\u20138 p.m.\n*1981 - CBS - Friday, February 27 - 8 p.m.\n*1982 - CBS - Saturday, March 27 - 8 p.m.\n*1983 - CBS - Friday, March 18 - 8 p.m.\n*1984 - CBS - Friday, March 30 - 8 p.m.\n*1985 - CBS - Friday, March 1\u20138 p.m.\n*1986 - CBS - Saturday, February 15 - 8 p.m.\n*1987 - CBS - Friday, March 6\u20138 p.m.\n*1988 - CBS - Wednesday, February 24 - 8:30&nbsp;p.m.\nDelayed due to a CBS News Special report.\n*1989 - CBS - Sunday, March 18 - 8 p.m.\n*1990 - CBS - Tuesday, February 20 - 8 p.m.\n*1991 - CBS - Tuesday, March 19 - 8 p.m.\nSoundtrack remastered in stereo using CBS StereoSound system.\n*1991 - CBS - Wednesday, November 27 - 8 p.m.\nThe first time the film aired twice in the same year.

''Peter Pan'' had first been shown live on TV by NBC in 1955, and been repeated (again live) by public demand in 1956. Its enormous success on television ushered in a temporary \"fad\" of mostly live family-oriented specials based on fantasy tales, such as ''[[Aladdin (1958 film)|Aladdin]]'' (1958, and no relation to the Disney film that came out 34 years later), ''Alice in Wonderland'' (1955) (a live-action version), [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s ''[[Cinderella (Rodgers and Hammerstein musical)|Cinderella]]'' (1957), ''[[The Pied Piper of Hamelin (1957 film)|The Pied Piper of Hamelin]]'' (1957), and ''[[Pinocchio (1957 TV-musical)|Pinocchio]]'' (1957, no relation to the Disney film). As part of this trend, CBS bought the rights from MGM to telecast ''The Wizard of Oz''.\n\nFor the first TV broadcast of ''The Wizard of Oz'', the normally 90-minute ''Ford Star Jubilee'' was expanded to a full two hours to accommodate the entire film, which, in addition to having commercial breaks, was celebrity [[Television presenter|hosted]]. The main reason that CBS arranged for a host for the film was that at 101-minutes, the film was not considered long enough to run in the allotted 120-minute slot at that time, even with commercial breaks, without additional content to pad the entire telecast out to two hours.<ref>''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', {{Clarify|page needed|date=December 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe 1956 television debut of the film marked the only time any actor who had appeared in the movie was selected to host the broadcast: [[Bert Lahr]], who played the Cowardly Lion (and his Kansas farmhand counterpart Zeke) in the film, appeared alongside the daughter of [[Judy Garland]], a then 10 year old [[Liza Minnelli]], and young Oz expert Justin G. Schiller. [[Lorna Luft]], Minnelli's half-sister, did not appear as she was only four years old at the time, although she did have her picture taken with Minnelli in a promotional photo. Unlike several of the other ''Oz'' telecasts, apparently no stills were taken during the hosting sequences in 1956.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone and William Stillman. ''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', Warner Books, 1989</ref> The practice of a show business celebrity regularly \"hosting\" ''The Wizard of Oz'' lasted from the film's first television showing until 1968, when the film went to NBC after being shown on CBS nine times.\n\nThe film was always presented uncut in a two-hour time slot between 1956 and 1968, despite having commercials and hosted segments. The Professor Marvel sequence has never been omitted (at least in American telecasts of the film),{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} and the tracking shot of [[Munchkinland]] was not edited until the film went to NBC in 1968.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nThe film's first broadcast received positive critical notices in newspapers the following day. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine prophetically suggested that the film could be telecast annually and at an earlier time.<ref name=VarReview/><ref>Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone and William Stillman. ''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', Warner Books, 1989, p.215</ref>\n\nThe film was a ratings success with a [[Nielsen rating]] of 33.9 and an audience share of 53%.<ref name=rating>{{cite magazine|title=Hit Movies on U.S. TV Since 1961|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=January 24, 1990|page=160}}</ref>\n\n==Telecasts in the pre-cable era==\nThe film was not rebroadcast in 1957 or 1958. For telecasts from 1959 (the year of its second telecast) up until 1998, the film was always shown as a stand-alone [[television special|TV special]] instead of as part of an anthology or movie series. Between 1959 and 1968, and again in 1990 when [[Angela Lansbury]], star of CBS' ''[[Murder She Wrote]]'', hosted the 50th-anniversary telecast, CBS chose its hosts from its then-current [[prime time]] lineup. In 1959, the host was [[Red Skelton]] (''[[The Red Skelton Show]]''); in 1960 it was [[Richard Boone]] (''[[Have Gun, Will Travel]]''), in 1961 and 1962 it was [[Dick Van Dyke]] (''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]''), and from 1964 through 1967, it was [[Danny Kaye]] (''[[The Danny Kaye Show]]''). Skelton, Boone and Van Dyke brought their then-young children along to appear with them.\n\nAlthough the hosting segments for the 1956 telecast of the film had to be done live, Skelton's, Boone's, Van Dyke's and Kaye's segments were recorded on [[video tape]] in advance of the telecasts.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C8wEHQAACAAJ&dq=The+Wizard+of+Oz:+50th+Anniversary+Celebration&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0VCqUb7EFofO9gTM1YGwBg&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA|title=The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History|first1=John|last1=Fricke|first2=Jay|last2=Scarfone|first3=William|last3=Stillman|date=11 September 1990|publisher=Grand Central Publishing|accessdate=11 September 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref> Lansbury's hosting segment was the first one recorded on film.\n\nDuring these years, the hosting sequences were not staged in a run-of-the-mill manner, with the host merely standing in a studio set, but in what could be considered imaginative ways. Richard Boone was taped on the set of his television series ''Have Gun, Will Travel'', in a \"living room\" with his real son about to watch the film on a TV set. Dick Van Dyke was shown in a living room set with his children,<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/> and Danny Kaye's hosting segment featured him sitting on a prop [[toadstool]] against a painted backdrop of the [[Yellow brick road|Yellow Brick Road]] and the [[Emerald City]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mrpopculture.com/files/html/jan19-1964/|title=Facts/History/Trivia/Music - Year In Review Video Timeline - 1955 Through 2013|website=www.mrpopculture.com|accessdate=11 September 2018}}</ref> The Kaye segment did not include a television set as part of its design.\n\nSome humor was sometimes incorporated into these segments. Red Skelton was seen as two characters: Before the film began, he was seen in a studio set of an early 20th-century bookstore, in costume as a [[Victorian fashion|Victorian]]-era storyteller who introduced [[L. Frank Baum]]'s original 1900 novel ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' to a young girl played by Skelton's real daughter, and at film's end, he appeared in a studio recreation of a modern living room as himself. Danny Kaye reassured viewers not to panic when the film began in black-and-white rather than in color, and encouraged young viewers not to be afraid of the roaring MGM lion at the beginning of the film. No directors or writers were credited for the hosting sequences, just as none are credited for hosting segments prior to films on Turner Classic Movies.\n\n''The Wizard of Oz'' did not become an annual television tradition immediately \u2014 only after the 1959 showing, when, because of the earlier hour at which it was shown (6:00 P.M., E.S.T.), more children tuned into the broadcast, and it gained an even larger television audience than before with a Nielsen rating of 36.5 and an audience share of 58%.<ref name=rating/> The 1959 telecast was especially welcomed by media critic [[John Crosby (media critic)|John Crosby]], who commented in the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', \"Television \u2014 any television \u2014 looks awfully ordinary after ''The Wizard of Oz''\".<ref>Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone. The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History, Warner Books, 1989</ref> From 1959 until 1991, the film was telecast once every year, the one exception being 1963, when it was not telecast at all.\n\n[[WISN-TV]] in [[Milwaukee]], Wisconsin, did not carry the network's yearly ''Oz'' telecast in 1961, the year WISN began its affiliation with CBS, running [[Green Bay Packers]] football instead. However, due to viewer outcry, WISN was able to get permission to run the film locally at 2:00&nbsp;p.m. C.S.T., on Christmas Eve.<ref>\"TV Screen,\" ''The Milwaukee Journal'', Milwaukee, Wisc., 24 December 1961, https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LzsaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=DCcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6142%2C1372025</ref>\n\nIn 1978, after the film had returned to CBS, a computer malfunction at the CBS owned-and-operated [[WBBM-TV]] in [[Chicago]] accidentally cut off most of the ending to that year's ''Oz'' telecast, interrupting the final minute with a commercial block that was not supposed to air until after the movie had ended.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Because the break was only 42 seconds long, no attempt was made to override the computer, for fear of making the problem worse.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} For several hours thereafter, WBBM received angry calls from viewers, while those unable to get through chose to voice their displeasure wrote to the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' newspapers.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n===\"Wraparound\" opening and closing credits===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\nThe film, as telecast on U.S. television between 1959 and 1968, was arguably given a much more elaborate TV presentation than it received afterwards. During those years, it always had videotaped wraparound [[opening credits|opening]] and [[closing credits]] segments devised by CBS, accompanied by the network's own specially recorded opening and closing music based on the film's score. For the opening \"wraparound\" credits, the title '''The Wizard of Oz''' and the names of its five leading actors, [[Judy Garland]], [[Frank Morgan]], [[Ray Bolger]], Bert Lahr, and [[Jack Haley]], were first shown in CBS's own format and [[font]], while an anonymous announcer read them off and then followed this with an announcement of the film's sponsor(s): \"This portion of ''The Wizard of Oz'' is brought to you by...[name of sponsor mentioned]\". These specially-devised opening credits never mentioned that the film was made by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. From 1959 to 1964, CBS created different wraparound credits for each showing, but because the same hosting segment \u2014 the Danny Kaye one \u2014 was shown between 1964 and 1968, audiences saw the same \"wraparound\" credits from 1964 until the film went to NBC.\n\nThe special CBS introduction was followed by the host speaking about the movie for about three minutes or so. Those remarks lead into the actual film, beginning with all of its original 1939 [[opening credits]] (shown against a background of moving clouds), including the MGM [[Leo the Lion (MGM)|Leo the Lion]] logo, the name of the film, the cast list, and the film's principal technical staff, exactly as MGM had created them, with the film's [[main title]] music heard.\n\nThe host reappeared just before the film's second half began, to say a few more words about it, before the telecast proceeded with the rest of the film, commercials included.\n\nHowever, at the end of the movie, the film's closing cast list, as created by MGM, was not be shown, and the title card with \"The End\" right after Dorothy's closing line was never seen on television during these early CBS showings. Instead, immediately after Dorothy spoke her last line (\"Oh, Auntie Em, there's no place like home!\"), and the camera faded out on her, television viewers once again saw CBS's own title card '''The Wizard of Oz''', this time accompanied by some of the film's end title music, exactly as heard on the [[soundtrack]], and the announcer's voice saying that the host for that year would return in a moment. After a final commercial, the host was then seen once again, to bid farewell to the TV audience, and CBS showed its own version of the cast list that appears during the film's end credits. At the end, referring to both the film and the hosting segments, the same announcer declared that \"This has been a film and videotape presentation.\"\n\n===Shown in color===\nFrom the beginning ''The Wizard of Oz'' was telecast in color, although few people owned [[color television]] sets in 1956.  Except for 1961, all U.S. telecasts have been in color, an effect that seemed much more striking in the early 1960s, when there were still relatively few color programs on television. It was not televised in color in 1961 because color telecasts had to be paid for by their sponsors, who declined to do so that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mrpopculture.com/files/html/dec08-1961/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-14 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426051707/http://www.mrpopculture.com/files/html/dec08-1961/ |archivedate=2012-04-26 |df= }}</ref><ref>Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone. ''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', Warner Books, 1989, p. 214.</ref> Between 1956 and 1965, the ''Wizard of Oz'' showings were rare exceptions to the black and white program schedule at CBS. During this period, CBS had the ability to broadcast programs in color, but generally chose not to do so unless a sponsor paid for a film or program to be shown in color. During this period, the competing network NBC was owned by [[RCA]], which by 1960 manufactured 95% of the color sets sold in the U.S. Hence, CBS perceived that increased use of color broadcasting would primarily benefit its rival by promoting sales of RCA color television sets.{{Citation needed|reason=According to Steve Hoffman's website, the main reason the CBS did few color telecasts until 1965 is because their initial color broadcasting system was rejected by the Federal Communications Commission in the early 1950s.  A source to back up this claim as a reason should be provided.|date=August 2019}}\n\nNot until the fall of 1965 did color broadcasts play a major role at CBS and ABC, at which time half the network shows from ABC and CBS were being made and shown in color. Meanwhile, all but two NBC prime time shows were in color and most of NBC's daytime shows were. By the fall of 1966, all three networks produced all of their prime time shows in color. By the time the movie went to NBC in 1968, all network shows (except for reruns of black and white movies) were in color.\n\n===Later hosts===\n{{More citations needed|section, except for one footnote, |date=June 2013}}\nPartly because commercial time during programs increased beginning in the late 1960s, the idea of regularly having hosts to introduce the film was dropped when ''The Wizard of Oz'' went to [[NBC]] in 1968, where no \"wraparound\" sequence was shown. The presentation consisted only of the film itself, with its original opening and closing credits, and no special NBC-created credits or hosting segments. The famous [[NBC peacock]] was shown immediately prior to the beginning of the film, with announcer [[Mel Brandt]] saying that \"the first 22 minutes of this program [i.e. the Kansas and tornado sequences] will be shown in black-and-white\", a not quite accurate statement, since the final three minutes of the film also took place in Kansas, and were at that time also shown in black-and-white, rather than in the [[sepia tone]] in which they originally had been made (the sepia was not restored to the Kansas and tornado scenes until 1989, the film's 50th anniversary). However, one NBC telecast featured an on-screen host: the 1970 showing, which opened with veteran actor [[Gregory Peck]] paying tribute to the recently deceased Judy Garland (a segment directed by ''Oz'' producer [[Mervyn LeRoy]], marking his first TV work), although this segment consisted of only a few brief remarks, while the opening hosting segments on CBS had gone on for about three minutes or so. The NBC ''Oz'' telecasts began the tradition of the film's annual showings during the [[Easter]] and [[Passover]] seasons of the year as opposed to the winter showings on [[CBS]].\n\nThe switch in networks resulted because CBS was unwilling to meet MGM's increased price \u2014 fostered by the film's ever increasing popularity \u2014 for renewal of the rights to telecast it.<ref>Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone and William Stillman. \"The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History\", Warner Books, 1989.</ref>  The film stayed on NBC until 1976. When CBS, realizing its error in allowing it to go to another network, bought back the rights at MGM's asking price, their viewer ratings shot up, and one executive was heard to remark, \"That picture is better [for the network] than a gushing oil well\".<ref>http://www.docstoc.com/docs/8043642/New-book-sell-sheet</ref>\n\nAfter its 1976 return to CBS, the film was hosted on that network only once more, in a filmed segment featuring Angela Lansbury in 1990, but the CBS \"wraparound\" opening and closing credits were not - and have never been - revived, although, during those years, a blue card featuring a painting of a rainbow and the title '''The Wizard of Oz''' ''was'' shown on the screen while the night's pre-empted programs or programs to be shown at regular time and the sponsors were being announced, and immediately before and after commercial breaks. In the 1980s clips from the film shown on a red background with title was shown at the start, while a still of Emerald City with title was used during commercials. Angela Lansbury also narrated a documentary about the making of the film, originally entitled ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: 50 Years of Magic'' and years later re-titled ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: The Making of a Movie Classic''. It was first shown immediately after the movie's 1990 telecast, and is included as a supplement on all the DVD releases beginning with the 1999 DVD release. [[Jack Haley, Jr.]], the documentary's director, was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] for his work.\n\nWhen shown on Turner Classic Movies, ''The Wizard of Oz'' was usually hosted by TCM host [[Robert Osborne]].\n\nOn June 3, 2007, [[Tom Kenny]], the voice of [[SpongeBob SquarePants]], hosted a telecast of the film on Turner Classic Movies, as part of ''Essentials, Jr.'', a special summer series of family movies.\n\nOn July 27, 2008, the film was shown twice in a row on [[Turner Network Television]] without a host, but with commercials, and with \"pop-up\" animated ads for other TNT programs at the bottom of the screen just before and after commercial breaks.\n\nOn March 24 and 25, 2012, the film was hosted on Cartoon Network by television actor [[Robert Wu]], who provides the voice of Mr. Washee Washee in the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode, \"[[Tiegs for Two]]\". This telecast ran two-and-a-half hours, longer than any CBS or NBC telecasts.\n\nOn June 10, 2012, which would have been Judy Garland's 90th birthday, the film was telecast on Turner Classic Movies without commercials, and hosted by comedian [[Bill Hader]], again as part of the ''Essentials, Jr.'' summer series of family films. Unlike the CBS hosting segments which were a part of the 1960s telecasts of the film, Hader's segment showed clips from the film before it actually began.\n\n===Sponsorship===\nBeing a presentation of network TV, ''The Wizard of Oz'' was subject to sponsorship from a variety of advertisers.\n\nThe first telecast of \"Oz\" was a presentation of [[Ford Star Jubilee]] and thus sponsored by [[Ford Motor Company]] and its dealers. In the ensuing years of 1959 thru 1967, the yearly telecast was sponsored by one primary sponsor with a co-sponsor. Perhaps the best remembered examples were the telecasts sponsored by [[Procter and Gamble]] and promoted when the company gave free premiums of hand puppets with packages of some of its most popular products. Many also remember the 1970 telecast presented on NBC by [[Singer Manufacturing Company]] as a tribute to Judy Garland, who had died in June 1969.\n\nIn later years, several different advertisers shared sponsorship; no one advertiser predominated.\n\n===Television ratings===\nThe showing in 1983 was the 25th network prime-time showing, a record then for any film or television special.  In the first nine showings, all on CBS, ''The Wizard of Oz'' gained at least 49% of the television audience.<ref>Harmetz, Aljean \"'Wizard of Oz': A TV Success Story,\" ''New York Times'', March 16, 1983. pg. C21. {{ISSN|0362-4331}}.</ref> In 1966, it ranked No. 1 in the ratings for the week that it was shown.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mrpopculture.com/files/December+1,+1966.pdf|title=Facts/History/Trivia/Music - Year In Review Video Timeline - 1955 Through 2013|website=www.mrpopculture.com|accessdate=11 September 2018}}</ref> Between 1960 and 1968, the film even beat out episodes of ABC-TV's ''[[Walt Disney Presents]]'' (in 1960) and NBC's ''[[Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color]]'' (from 1961 to 1968), which aired opposite the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://getty.net/texts/|title=Interesting Texts<!-- Bot generated title -->|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2018}}</ref>  When the film moved temporarily from CBS to NBC, it always preempted the Disney program altogether, except for once, when NBC showed ''Oz'' on a Saturday in 1968. When CBS bought the film back from NBC in 1976, it again began to beat episodes of Disney in the ratings. It preempted Disney on one more occasion, after the series moved to that network in the early 1980s.<ref>http://getty.net/texts/tv-67-83.txt</ref>\n\nIn 2006, the first year it was shown on TV in [[high-definition television|high-definition]], the film placed No. 11 in the Nielsen ratings among cable television programs for the week of November 11.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wrestlingclique.com/entertainment/14907-extended-nielsen-ratings-nov-6-12-a.html|title=Extended Nielsen Ratings for Nov 6-12|website=wrestlingclique.com|accessdate=11 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Changes made in running time===\nFrom 1968 to 1984, minor cuts were made to the film to make room for added commercial time and in order to have the film \"clock in\" at two hours. No dialogue or singing was removed, only moments such as camera pans and establishing shots, as well as MGM's written [[foreword]] to the film.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\nOn a few occasions beginning in 1985, again because of the increased time spent on commercial breaks, the film was time-compressed to fit it into a two-hour running time without cutting it.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> However, ''The Wizard of Oz'' is now always shown complete and at its regular speed on television, both with and without commercials. When shown with ads, the film now runs about two hours and fifteen minutes, simply because of the increase in commercial time.\n\n===March 1991 showing===\nThe March 1991 showing was the first after the film gained protected status from the Library of Congress and the National Film Preservation Board. Networks opted to no longer shorten the film by \"microcutting\" a few individual moments throughout the movie as had been done from the late 1960s to the early 1980s to make room for commercials and keep it in a two-hour broadcast. This extended the running time of the film from 8 P.M to 10:07&nbsp;p.m. and sometimes even longer, depending on the amount of time spent on commercials. It was one of the first 50 films selected for this protection.<ref>Glenn Collins, \"A Full-Length 'Oz' for TV.\" ''New York Times''. New York, N.Y.: March 19, 1991, p. C16. {{ISSN|0362-4331}}.</ref>\n\n==Move to cable==\nIn the 1980s, [[Ted Turner]] purchased the film from MGM, alongside ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''. Because both films were still licensed to CBS, Turner and the network negotiated a deal that extended CBS' license for ''Oz'' in exchange for relinquishing its rights to ''Gone with the Wind''.<ref name=TCMnotes>{{cite web | url = http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/852/The-Wizard-of-Oz/notes.html | title= ''The Wizard of Oz'' (1939): Notes | publisher = [[Turner Classic Movies|TCM]] | accessdate= 2014-02-08}}</ref> In 1991, the film was shown twice during the year for the first time.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} 1991 also marked the first time since 1956 that the film was shown in November. This also happened in 1993, when the film was telecast in both February and November of that year. The film was not shown on television at all in 1992, 1995 and 1997, marking the first time since 1963 that a year was skipped in showings of the film. Turner, which owned most of the pre-May 1986 MGM film and television library at the time (later owned by Warner Bros.), began moving to make its properties exclusive to Turner-owned outlets in the late 1990s; as such, in 1998, ''The Wizard of Oz'' made its last appearance on CBS, moving exclusively to Turner-owned properties the next year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/1998/tv/news/wizard-travels-to-tbs-1117469508/|title=\u2018Wizard\u2019 travels to TBS|last=Kissell|first=Rick|date=1998-04-06|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-30}}</ref>\n\n2000 marked the first time that the film was shown on U.S. television during the summer. In 2002, it was shown five times.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nOn November 6, 2011, TBS became the American television channel on which ''The Wizard of Oz'' has been shown most often, when the film had its 32nd showing on that channel, finally breaking CBS' record 31 showings. As of April 29, 2013, Turner Classic Movies has shown the film 23 times.\n\n===Differences between network and cable showings===\nIn addition to the frequent cable showings, another difference between showings on NBC, CBS, the WB network, and cable channels is that when the film was shown on CBS and NBC, it was always presented as a special instead of just a televised film. From 1959 until it went to cable, the film was never shown on [[NBC Saturday Night at the Movies]] or any other movie anthology series, and telecasts of the film regularly preempted two hours or more of regular television programming.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\nPromos for the CBS and NBC showings during the 1960s began airing on television as much as two weeks in advance of that year's telecast and were still airing as late as 1989.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}  On the major commercial networks, it was never termed a \"CBS Movie Special\" or an \"NBC Movie Special\", as movie specials shown on those networks are frequently termed, but as simply ''The Wizard of Oz''.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n===Aspect ratio===\nThe 1955 and 1998 theatrical re-releases were matted in movie theaters to produce a widescreen effect for the [[Aspect ratio (image)#Cinema terminology|Academy-standard]] [[aspect-ratio]] film.\n\nWhen shown in [[HDTV]], the film is [[pillarbox]]ed so that its aspect ratio is preserved.<ref>http://www.dtvforum.info/index.php?showtopic=43204</ref> On DVD, the film has always been issued in its original 1939 aspect ratio.<ref name=\"dvdtalk.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/39772/wizard-of-oz-the/|title=The Wizard of Oz (Blu-ray)|website=DVD Talk|accessdate=11 September 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"dvdtalk.com\"/><ref>http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/wizardozse.php</ref>\n\n==Outside the United States==\nThe movie has also been shown on television successfully in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]] and is shown every year in [[Australia]], but it has not become the television phenomenon there that it has in the U.S.<ref>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Website</ref> In Indonesia, the film was aired for the first time on the newly-inaugurated television network [[RCTI]] in November 1989, with reruns on other four networks in the 1990s. In Japan, the film has aired on the Japanese version of ''[[The Magical World of Disney]]'', although Disney had nothing to do with its production or release.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpgHF2JPQ3I|title=Disney Channel Japan  - The Wizard of Oz: Promo|first=|last=pdptappl|date=16 December 2009|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2018|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n== Broadcast Television Airdates ==\nEastern Time (taken from TV Guide and from The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History).\n*1956 - CBS - Saturday, November 3\u20139:00&nbsp;p.m.\n::The film's first showing on television. It was shown in color although very few people owned color TV sets. This marked the only time it was ever aired that late on a non-cable television network (Turner Broadcasting frequently schedules two showings in a row on the same night, at 8:00 p.m. and 10:15 p.m.). Future showings began earlier in order to allow children to see it more easily. In addition, the prime time hour generally given to affiliates for local programming was taken back in order to run the movie early. This practice continued until the film was sold to NBC.\n*1959 - CBS - Sunday, December 13 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\n::The first of the film's annual showings. It was the success of this telecast, which gained a wider audience than the first, that persuaded CBS to make the film an annual tradition on television.\n*1960 - CBS - Sunday, December 11 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1961 - CBS - Sunday, December 10 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m. Only time fully shown in Black & White\n*1962 - CBS - Sunday, December 9 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.  December 16 in Hawaii - 5:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1964 - CBS - Sunday, January 26 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\nThe reason that the film did not air in December 1963 has never been stated, but some say that it was because of [[John F. Kennedy]]'s assassination, others say room needed to be made for more Christmas themed specials and that the movie fit in better during January. For whatever reason, the movie continued to air early in the year rather than late in the year from 1964 until the 1990s.\n*1965 - CBS - Sunday, January 17 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1966 - CBS - Sunday, January 9 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1967 - CBS - Sunday, February 12 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\nLast airing on CBS until 1976. Moved to NBC in 1968, at this time, the showings were moved from midwinter to late winter/early spring.\n*1968 - NBC - Saturday, April 20 - 7:00&nbsp;p.m.\nFirst showing by NBC, in Spring rather than Winter. The first time that the film was shown at 7:00 P.M instead of 6:00 P.M.\n*1969 - NBC - Sunday, March 9 - 7:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1970 - NBC - Sunday, March 15 - 7:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1971 - NBC - Sunday, April 18 - 7:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1972 - NBC - Tuesday, March 7 - 7:00&nbsp;p.m.\nThe first time that the film aired in the middle of the week, rather than on a weekend.\n*1973 - NBC - Sunday, April 8 - 7:00 \n*1974 - NBC - Sunday, February 24 7:00&nbsp;p.m. Due to a breaking news story, NBC decided to show the film two weeks later, on March 10, rather than show it too late or in progress.\n*1975 - NBC - Easter Sunday, March 30 - 7:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1976 - CBS - Sunday, March 14 - 7 p.m.\nThe year that ''The Wizard Of Oz'' returned to CBS. It remained there for twenty-two more years, a likely record in those years for a film's consecutive showings on one network. Initially the movie aired late winter/early spring, but beginning in 1991, the movie moved back and forth from spring to late fall. Another change was that CBS no longer began the movie before normal prime time. Before 1976, when run on a day other than Sunday, NBC took back the 7 p.m. Eastern / 6 p.m. Central time slots from affiliates to run the movie early enough so children could see it before bedtime. Also, prior to 1968, CBS always took the 6 p.m. hour to run the movie early. Logic was that times have changed and children now stay up a little later than they did in the past. From then on, if shown in a Sunday 6 to 8 or 7 to 9 pm time slot on CBS, the film preempted ''60 Minutes'', so beginning in 1978, CBS executives moved the showings to other nights of the week. If the film was shown on a Sunday, CBS usually scheduled it at 8 pm, so that it did not conflict with ''60 Minutes''. (As of 2017, ''60 Minutes'' continues to air in the same Sunday 7 p.m. time slot on CBS.)\n*1977 - CBS - Sunday, March 20 - 7 p.m.\n*1978 - CBS - Easter Sunday, March 26 - 7 p.m.\n*1979 - CBS - Friday, March 23 - 8 p.m.\n*1980 - CBS - Friday, March 7\u20138 p.m.\n*1981 - CBS - Friday, February 27 - 8 p.m.\n*1982 - CBS - Saturday, March 27 - 8 p.m.\n*1983 - CBS - Friday, March 18 - 8 p.m.\n*1984 - CBS - Friday, March 30 - 8 p.m.\n*1985 - CBS - Friday, March 1\u20138 p.m.\n*1986 - CBS - Saturday, February 15 - 8 p.m.\n*1987 - CBS - Friday, March 6\u20138 p.m.\n*1988 - CBS - Wednesday, February 24 - 8:30&nbsp;p.m.\nDelayed due to a CBS News Special report.\n*1989 - CBS - Sunday, March 18 - 8 p.m.\n*1990 - CBS - Tuesday, February 20 - 8 p.m.\n*1991 - CBS - Tuesday, March 19 - 8 p.m.\nSoundtrack remastered in stereo using CBS StereoSound system.\n*1991 - CBS - Wednesday, November 27 - 8 p.m.\nThe first time the film aired twice in the same year.
