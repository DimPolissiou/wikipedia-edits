The mountain ranges [[B\u00f6rzs\u00f6ny]], [[Cserh\u00e1t]] and [[M\u00e1tra]] lie partly in the county.\n\nDue to the mountains, the county is characterised by small villages nestled in the valleys. The two largest settlements are [[Balassagyarmat]], the former county seat, and Salg\u00f3tarj\u00e1n, which has become a center of industry in the early 20th century due to coal mines nearby.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|N\u00f3gr\u00e1d County (former)}}\nN\u00f3gr\u00e1d (-Hungarian, in Latin: ''comitatus Neogradiensis'', in German: ''Neuburg'' or ''Neograd'', in Slovak: ''Novohrad'') was also the name of a historic administrative county ([[Comitatus (Kingdom of Hungary)|comitatus]]) of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]].

It shares borders with [[Slovakia]] and the Hungarian counties [[Pest (county)|Pest]], [[Heves (county)|Heves]] and [[Borsod-Aba\u00faj-Zempl\u00e9n]]. The capital of N\u00f3gr\u00e1d county is [[Salg\u00f3tarj\u00e1n]]. Its area is 2,544&nbsp;km\u00b2. It is the smallest county by population and the second smallest by area (after Kom\u00e1rom-Esztergom).\n\nN\u00f3gr\u00e1d is famous for its historic architecture of ancient Gothic churches and stone castles dated to the 13th century. Other historic landmark includes the baroque buildings constructed in the 18th century and the Vay, Teleki. Much of the northern border of the county is formed by the river [[Ipe\u013e|Ipoly]]. The mountain ranges [[B\u00f6rzs\u00f6ny]], [[Cserh\u00e1t]] and [[M\u00e1tra]] lie partly in the county.\n\nDue to the mountains, the county is characterised by small villages nestled in the valleys. The two largest settlements are [[Balassagyarmat]], the former county seat, and Salg\u00f3tarj\u00e1n, which has become a center of industry in the early 20th century due to coal mines nearby.\n\n==History==\n{{Main article|N\u00f3gr\u00e1d County (former)}}\nN\u00f3gr\u00e1d (-Hungarian, in Latin: ''comitatus Neogradiensis'', in German: ''Neuburg'' or ''Neograd'', in Slovak: ''Novohrad'') was also the name of a historic administrative county ([[Comitatus (Kingdom of Hungary)|comitatus]]) of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. The name stems from the [[N\u00f3gr\u00e1d#Etymology|former N\u00f3gr\u00e1d castle]] ({{lang-sk|Novohrad}} - this name is still used in Slovakia as well as the informal designation of the corresponding territory, now located in southern [[Slovakia]] and in northern [[Hungary]]).\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Pie chart\n|thumb = right\n|caption = Religion in N\u00f3gr\u00e1d County (2011 census)\n|label1 = [[Catholic Church]]\n|value1 = 55.4\n|color1 = DarkOrchid\n|label2 = [[Greek Catholicism]]\n|value2 = 0.2\n|color2 = MediumOrchid\n|label3 = [[Lutheranism]]\n|value3 = 3.9\n|color3 = DeepSkyBlue\n|label4 = [[Calvinism]]\n|value4 = 2.1\n|color4 = DodgerBlue\n|label5 = Other religions\n|value5 = 1.8\n|color5 = Chartreuse\n|label6 = [[Irreligion|Non-religious]]\n|value6 = 12.2\n|color6 = Honeydew\n|label7 = [[Atheism|Atheists]]\n|value7 = 0.9\n|color7 = Grey\n|label8 = Undeclared\n|value8 = 23.5\n|color8 = Black\n}}\n{{see also|Demographics of Hungary}}\nIn 2015, it had a population of 195,923 and the [[population density]] was 77/km\u00b2.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Their relationship continues in season 4, although Sheldon often points out that they are not in a romantic relationship (stating that she \"is a girl who is a friend, but is not my girlfriend\").

In \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 6)|The Cooper/Kripke Inversion]]\", after being directly asked by Penny if he would ever have sex with Amy, Sheldon admits to Penny and Leonard that a physical relationship with Amy is a possibility, and being touched is something he is working on. While upset about Kripke, Amy does give him a consoling hug that Sheldon seems to need, and want. Even so, Amy has offered other romantic physical contact, and was very uncomfortable when they had to cuddle. In \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 6)|The Spoiler Alert Segmentation]]\", Leonard temporarily moves out and Amy proposes that she would be his perfect roommate and tries to move in, though Sheldon is uncomfortable with this change in their relationship. While playing Dungeons and Dragons during \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 6)|The Love Spell Potential]]\", Sheldon's and Amy's characters are commanded to have sex within the game. A very upset Amy asks Sheldon if they are ever going to be intimate and he again admits that it is a possibility.\n\nIn season 7, Sheldon passionately kisses Amy on the lips for the first time. Initially to prove a point, he later prolonged it, implying he enjoyed the feeling.<ref>{{cite episode|title=[[The Big Bang Theory (season 7)#ep15|The Locomotive Manipulation]]|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=February 6, 2014|season=7|number=15}}</ref> Later episodes showed him willingly kissing Amy, implying he has gotten more comfortable in such a position of physical intimacy. The ultimate proof of Sheldon having feelings for Amy is given in the season 8 episode \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 8)|The Prom Equivalency]]\", when he finally admits being in love with her: \"I love you too. There's no denying I have feelings for you that can't be explained in any other way. I briefly considered I had a brain parasite, but that seems even more far-fetched. The only conclusion was love.\" In the season 8 finale, \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 8)|The Commitment Determination]]\", Sheldon and Amy get into a fight over their definition of \"commitment\".  Sheldon feels his relationship with Amy is going fast on its own, but Amy argues he is taking things too slowly and does not properly bestow on her unlimited affection. By the episode's end she has decided to take a break from their relationship while Sheldon is left numb from Amy's revelation. He glumly reveals that he had been planning on proposing to Amy with his grandmother's ring, a family heirloom.\n\nIn the season 9 premiere, Sheldon keeps pushing Amy to make up her mind about their relationship, but goes too far and insults her to her face and she angrily breaks up with him for good, thus officially ending their relationship. In \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 9)|The Platonic Permutation]]\" Amy offers Sheldon to get back together with her after spending time together in an aquarium at Thanksgiving, but sadly learns that he simply just wants to be her friend, with him revealing to her that \"I excel at many things, but getting over you wasn't one of them\". In \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 9)|The Earworm Reverberation]]\", Sheldon can't get a [[Darlin' (The Beach Boys song)|song]] out his head, but after suddenly remembering the title and the lyrics, he realizes that the song was about Amy and that she changed his life for the better, which prompts him to go to her apartment to profess his love. He finds Amy on a date with Dave, who has a great adoration for Sheldon because of his intellect. Seeing how much they love each other, Dave gleefully urges Sheldon to kiss Amy, leading to their reunion. In the following episode, \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 9)|The Opening Night Excitation]]\" Leonard, Howard and Raj go to see ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'' without Sheldon as while he was initially reluctant, ultimately opted to celebrate Amy's birthday with her instead. To make Amy's birthday enjoyable and memorable, Sheldon seeks out Penny and Bernadette as he respects their opinions regarding all things socially appropriate.  He reveals to them that he has narrowed things down to three options, the first being a chance to play the [[harp]] with the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]], the second being an all-expense-paid trip to the Wisconsin Sheep and Wool Festival (though Amy would have to go alone because Sheldon's [[ornithophobia]] is nothing compared to his fear of sheep), and the third being the two of them engaging in [[coitus]], at which point Penny squeezes and shatters the wine glass in her hand due to disbelief and/or shock. After Penny and Bernadette convince him that finally being intimate with her is the most beautiful gift that he could give to her, Sheldon and Amy have sex for the first time on the latter's birthday.\n\nIn season 10, Sheldon and Amy move in together for a five-week experiment to test out their compatibility,<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Cohabitation Experimentation|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 10)#ep4|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=October 10, 2016|season=10|number=4}}</ref> and after its successful run, decide to move in together permanently.<ref name=\"The Veracity Elasticity\"/> In its season finale, Sheldon unexpectedly proposes to Amy after being hit on by Ramona Nowitzki.

In [[The Big Bang Theory (season 12)|the series finale]], both Sheldon and Amy are recipients of the [[Nobel Prize in physics]] for their discovery of super asymmetry which they first worked on moments before their wedding. In Amy's speech, she encourages young girls around the world to study whatever they want. Instead of giving a self-centered speech, Sheldon [[The_Big_Bang_Theory_(season_12)#speech|thanks]] his family, his friends and his wife Amy for always supporting him.\n\nHe once idolized fictional prodigy [[Wesley Crusher]] from ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', portrayed by Wil Wheaton, until Wheaton did not show up at a convention attended by Sheldon in 1995. Sheldon had spent 15 hours on a bus travelling to the convention during which time he was forced to break his rule about urinating in a moving vehicle. After this moment Wil Wheaton became number six on Sheldon's mortal enemy list (a list he started when he was 9 on a 5\u00bc-inch [[floppy disk]]). Wheaton was one of Sheldon's mortal enemies, along with his coworkers [[Barry Kripke]] and [[Leslie Winkle]].

He also has a maternal aunt, Charlene, which was revealed in ''Young Sheldon'' when his mother told Meemaw that she made dinner for \u201cCharlene and Edward\u201d more times than her.

Their relationship continues in season 4, although Sheldon often points out that they are not in a romantic relationship (stating that she \"is a girl who is a friend, but is not my girlfriend\").

In \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 6)|The Cooper/Kripke Inversion]]\", after being directly asked by Penny if he would ever have sex with Amy, Sheldon admits to Penny and Leonard that a physical relationship with Amy is a possibility, and being touched is something he is working on. While upset about Kripke, Amy does give him a consoling hug that Sheldon seems to need, and want. Even so, Amy has offered other romantic physical contact, and was very uncomfortable when they had to cuddle. In \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 6)|The Spoiler Alert Segmentation]]\", Leonard temporarily moves out and Amy proposes that she would be his perfect roommate and tries to move in, though Sheldon is uncomfortable with this change in their relationship. While playing Dungeons and Dragons during \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 6)|The Love Spell Potential]]\", Sheldon's and Amy's characters are commanded to have sex within the game. A very upset Amy asks Sheldon if they are ever going to be intimate and he again admits that it is a possibility.\n\nIn season 7, Sheldon passionately kisses Amy on the lips for the first time. Initially to prove a point, he later prolonged it, implying he enjoyed the feeling.<ref>{{cite episode|title=[[The Big Bang Theory (season 7)#ep15|The Locomotive Manipulation]]|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=February 6, 2014|season=7|number=15}}</ref> Later episodes showed him willingly kissing Amy, implying he has gotten more comfortable in such a position of physical intimacy. The ultimate proof of Sheldon having feelings for Amy is given in the season 8 episode \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 8)|The Prom Equivalency]]\", when he finally admits being in love with her: \"I love you too. There's no denying I have feelings for you that can't be explained in any other way. I briefly considered I had a brain parasite, but that seems even more far-fetched. The only conclusion was love.\" In the season 8 finale, \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 8)|The Commitment Determination]]\", Sheldon and Amy get into a fight over their definition of \"commitment\".  Sheldon feels his relationship with Amy is going fast on its own, but Amy argues he is taking things too slowly and does not properly bestow on her unlimited affection. By the episode's end she has decided to take a break from their relationship while Sheldon is left numb from Amy's revelation. He glumly reveals that he had been planning on proposing to Amy with his grandmother's ring, a family heirloom.\n\nIn the season 9 premiere, Sheldon keeps pushing Amy to make up her mind about their relationship, but goes too far and insults her to her face and she angrily breaks up with him for good, thus officially ending their relationship. In \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 9)|The Platonic Permutation]]\" Amy offers Sheldon to get back together with her after spending time together in an aquarium at Thanksgiving, but sadly learns that he simply just wants to be her friend, with him revealing to her that \"I excel at many things, but getting over you wasn't one of them\". In \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 9)|The Earworm Reverberation]]\", Sheldon can't get a [[Darlin' (The Beach Boys song)|song]] out his head, but after suddenly remembering the title and the lyrics, he realizes that the song was about Amy and that she changed his life for the better, which prompts him to go to her apartment to profess his love. He finds Amy on a date with Dave, who has a great adoration for Sheldon because of his intellect. Seeing how much they love each other, Dave gleefully urges Sheldon to kiss Amy, leading to their reunion. In the following episode, \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 9)|The Opening Night Excitation]]\" Leonard, Howard and Raj go to see ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'' without Sheldon as while he was initially reluctant, ultimately opted to celebrate Amy's birthday with her instead. To make Amy's birthday enjoyable and memorable, Sheldon seeks out Penny and Bernadette as he respects their opinions regarding all things socially appropriate.  He reveals to them that he has narrowed things down to three options, the first being a chance to play the [[harp]] with the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]], the second being an all-expense-paid trip to the Wisconsin Sheep and Wool Festival (though Amy would have to go alone because Sheldon's [[ornithophobia]] is nothing compared to his fear of sheep), and the third being the two of them engaging in [[coitus]], at which point Penny squeezes and shatters the wine glass in her hand due to disbelief and/or shock. After Penny and Bernadette convince him that finally being intimate with her is the most beautiful gift that he could give to her, Sheldon and Amy have sex for the first time on the latter's birthday.\n\nIn season 10, Sheldon and Amy move in together for a five-week experiment to test out their compatibility,<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Cohabitation Experimentation|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 10)#ep4|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=October 10, 2016|season=10|number=4}}</ref> and after its successful run, decide to move in together permanently.<ref name=\"The Veracity Elasticity\"/> In its season finale, Sheldon unexpectedly proposes to Amy after being hit on by Ramona Nowitzki.

And what we\u2019re trying to show with our show is that this is a group of people who likely were teased, mocked, told that they will never be appreciated or loved, and we have a group of people who have successful careers, active social lives (that involve things like Dungeons and Dragons and video games), but they also have relationships, and that\u2019s a fulfilling and satisfying life.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gill|first=Jim|title='Is Sheldon autistic?
