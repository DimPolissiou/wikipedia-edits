As Taranaki representative Moturoa won this cup in 1964. \n\nThe club formed a strong reserve team during this year and in 1965 the team won the Acheson Cup playing in the local second division.\n\nIn 1966 the Central Districts League split into a Western League and a Nelson-Manawatu league. Moturoa played in the Western League for the Pearce Cup finishing third behind Thistle (Manawatu) and Kiwi United. The decision to not compete for the Julian Cup this season marked the end of a seven year reign over the Taranaki championship beginning in 1959. The second team also played out of the province. \n\n1967: The Wanganui clubs oppose the entry of Eastern Union (Gisborne) from the Eastern League to the Western League. All other clubs withdraw from the Western League and create the two division Central Districts League. Moturoa competes in the Premier Division with Eastern Union, Manawatu Thistle, Kiwi United, Napier Rovers and St. Andrews. A second Taranaki representative, Stratford AFC finished 8th in the ten team first division. \n\nThe Taranaki-Wanganui League is won by an undefeated Moturoa who compete in both leagues, with Wanganui Athletic, Western Suburbs (Wanganui), New Plymouth United, Waitara, New Plymouth Old Boys and Wanganui United finishing in that order.\n\n1968: The first Central League begins. \n\nMoturoa has two teams in the local Taranaki division one league. Moturoa A go unbeaten and win the Julian Cup and the MBTC Cup knock-out.\n\nIn 1969 Moturoa wins the Julian Cup and entering the play-offs qualifies after the reconstruction of the Central League in 1970 along with Upper Hutt United, Napier City and Wanganui Athletic. Moturoa though does not take part, its place taken by CYFC (Wellington). The Pearce Cup for travelling reasons and expense was reduced to the Wanganui and Manawatu and Taranaki clubs weren't invited to play. This arrangement lasted until 1972.\n\n1970: New Plymouth Old Boys win promotion to Central League for 1971. Moturoa win the Duff Rose Bowl \n\n1971: Moturoa A and B are first and second in the Taranaki First Division. An undefeated Moturoa come second to Douglas Villa in the Central League playoffs. Two wins and three drawn matches against Central League teams, Wanganui City and Johnson Villa, and regional champions Brooklyn United and Napier City not giving enough points for promotion, even with a strike rate of 18 goals in 5 games.\n\nIn the 1972 pre-season Moturoa beat Wellington's [[Waterside Karori|Waterside]] in the Hilton-Petone Cup $500 knock out, 2-1 at the Camp Reserve in Waitara. [[Eastern Suburbs AFC|Eastern Suburbs]] National League player P. Eliadis was on loan to Moturoa at his home ground at Waitara as a guest. His contract with the Lilywhites in the National League would see him flown from New Plymouth to Auckland to play. Eliadis would join Moturoa as player-coach in 1973 from Eastern Suburbs. The next round of the Hilton-Petone Cup was lost to National League club [[Gisborne City AFC|Gisborne City]] who had past Moturoa striker F. McDonald up front. \n\nFirst discussion about a Moturoa - Old Boys merger surfaces with talk in the media but amounts to nothing.\n\nMoturoa played back in the reformed Western League competition to play for the Presidents Cup. They finished top of the table with the same number of points as Kiwi United but lost on goal difference.\n\nIn a 1973 pre-season play-off Moturoa qualify for inclusion in the Central League Division Two. \n\nNew Plymouth club United and Moturoa join and establish Moturoa United, giving the club(s) a Central League and Western League team.\n\nOn 7 April 1973 the first match, an away game, in the Central League Division Two against home town rivals New Plymouth Old Boys, was played at Western Park, resulting in a 3\u20131 win for Moturoa United. Moturoa's team list for the inaugural Central League fixture: Paul Barratt, Don Harris, Ray Powell, Colin Selfe, Selwyn Brown, Peter Eliadis, Peter Wisnewski, Kevin Bussey, John Hunt, Geoff Collett, Robert Paul, Paul Brennan (sub for R. Paul).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Central League Soccer, ten year history of Central Regional Soccer League 1968-1977|last=Deverill|first=Victor, Charles|publisher=Wellington, Central Region|year=1978|isbn=|location=Puke Ariki, New Plymouth|pages=1\u2013175}}</ref>\n\nMoturoa United holds the honours of being the 1973 Central League Division Two champions<ref name=\":0\" /> gaining promotion to Division One for the 1974 season.\n\nIn 1974 New Plymouth rival clubs Central City and Old Boys began the New Plymouth City team. The team took the place of New Plymouth Old Boys in Division Two of the Central League, finishing last before relegation to Division Three for 1975. \n\nMid-season in the 1975 Moturoa United changed its name to Taranaki United. The Moturoa club chairman Mr. A. M. Hogan, players and officials from Moturoa United, City and Old Boys all agreeing to co-operate immediately to boost the provinces football standing. \n\nBoth Moturoa United and New Plymouth City, playing a division apart in the Central League changed to tangerine coloured kits for the remainder of 1975. \n\nIn 1976 the Taranaki Football Company entered into an arrangement with the other Taranaki clubs to provide their top players to a composite team [[Team Taranaki|Taranaki United]]. This agreement lasted until 1982 when the New Plymouth Old Boys club bought the Taranaki United identity and its position in the Central League as a limited company. Central City left the arrangement in 1983 taking the New Plymouth City name with them. The name Taranaki United was used until the end of the 1984 season, the team relegated from the first division with Porirua Viard Old Boys to the second division. From 1985 the team was solely called New Plymouth Old Boys.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ultimatenzsoccer.com/Database/id1430.htm|title=Moturoa|website=www.ultimatenzsoccer.com|access-date=2019-09-01}}</ref>\n\nUnder T. Brady, who had left the Hawera football club for the coaching role, Moturoa were promoted back to the Central League as Western League champions in 1985, winning also the City of New Plymouth tournament and the Duff Rose Bowl. \n\nMoturoa entered the Central League Third Division in 1986 and finished sixth, with home town rivals Central City playing as New Plymouth City, finishing 10th.\n\nIn 1987 Moturoa finished third. New Plymouth City won promotion behind Wainuiomata AFC to the second division.\n\nIn 1988 Moturoa finished ninth from eleven teams with Port Hill United and Takaro AFC beneath the club on the ladder. In the second division New Plymouth City also finished ninth.\n\nIn 1989 Moturoa and Central City<ref name=\"Central City\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ultimatenzsoccer.com/Database/id1457.htm|title=Central City|website=www.ultimatenzsoccer.com|access-date=2019-09-04}}</ref> formed a composite first team in the Central League called Moturoa/NP City. Moturoa relinquished the third division position with the new team taking the second division position held by City. <ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"Central City\" /> \n\nThe playing strip in 1989 mixed the colours of both clubs, with the Pony branded shirt in red with gold shoulders, trim and numbering, and the main sponsor, the Ngamotu Tavern across the chest in white.\n\nChatham Cup winner with [[Western Suburbs FC (New Zealand)|Western Suburbs FC]] in 1971, John Connor was assigned the head coaching role. Three players were brought in for the 1989 season, Englishmen [[Russell Irving]] and Darren Fletcher along with New Zealand under 16 midfielder Karl Cherrie. The team won promotion to Division One as runners up to winners [[Havelock North Wanderers]]. Moturoa City had the best defence in the entire three divisions of the Central League in 1989 with only 16 goals conceded in 22 matches while scoring 42.\n\nIn 1990 executive distractions off the pitch, travelling pressures, including an away match in the South Island, along with significant changes in the squad and the failure of the two clubs to agree on the conditions of a proposed amalgamation saw the team relegated back to the second division.\n\nMoturoa independently retained the position in Division Two of the Central League from 1991.  \n\nIn 1992 the creation of the Central Premier League restructured the divisions. Moturoa compete in Division One and finish mid-table.\n\nNew Plymouth City moved into Marfell Park after the ground and clubroom became available following the amalgamation of Star RFC and Spotswood Old Boys RFC remaining at the ground and climbing through the Central League until 1998 when the club, re-named Mt. Taranaki for its final year, were dissolved and the grounds and clubroom abandoned and eventually demolished.\n\nIn 1993, coached by Angus Livingstone, Moturoa won promotion to the Central Premier League as runners up to Stokes Valley. The acquisition of Stephen Douglas from Belfast's [[Glentoran FC]] and fellow Northern Irish countryman Tony Jones assisting the push for honours. Jones would later transfer to Napier City Rovers with Douglas returning to Europe.\n\n1994 saw Moturoa finish at the foot of the ladder in the Premier League and a decision was made by the club committee to withdraw from the Central League and return the focus of the club to local football for the 1995 season.  \n\nThere was talk in the air and media around this time of a merger between Woodleigh Cosmos and Moturoa, with the clubs already co-operating in the prior two seasons with composite ladies and youth teams. Both clubs remained independent with the reports amounting to nothing.  \n\nMoturoa won the Taranaki Premier League in 1999, scoring 86 goals and conceding only 15 goals with just one match ending in defeat. In 2000 the club was promoted to the Central Federation Premier League, having its final season to date at this level in 2003.<ref name=\":0\" />  \n\n==Taranaki Premier League Squad 2019==\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no= 1|pos=GK|nat=New Zealand         |name=Zane Coleman|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no= |pos=  |nat=|name=|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no= 3|pos=  |nat=New Zealand         |name= Ethan Webber|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no= 4|pos=  |nat=New Zealand         |name= Corbin Richardson|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no= 5|pos=   |nat=New Zealand         |name= Liam Scott|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no= 6|pos=   |nat=New Zealand         |name= Nathan Morath|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no= 7|pos=   |nat=New Zealand         |name= Jaden Taylor|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no= 8|pos=   |nat=New Zealand         |name= Troy Jury|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no= 9|pos=   |nat=New Zealand         |name= Hayden Murray|other=Captain}}\n{{Fs player|no=10|pos=     |nat=New Zealand|name= |other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=11 |pos=     |nat=New Zealand|name= Tyler Paterson|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=12|pos=  |nat=New Zealand        |name= Ash Reader-Nokes|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=13|pos=|nat=New Zealand        |name= Scott Manson|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=14|pos=|nat=New Zealand        |name= Jacob Crawford|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=15|pos=|nat=New Zealand        |name= Zayed Rabbaney|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=16|pos=|nat=New Zealand        |name= Sam Sutton|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=17|pos=|nat=New Zealand        |name= Sam Westlake|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=18|pos=|nat=New Zealand        |name= Nicholas Parthemore|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=19|pos=|nat=New Zealand|name= Dean Wilson|other=Squad Player}}\n{{Fs player|no=20|pos=|nat=New Zealand|name= Kayi Erol-Watt|other=Squad Player}}\n{{Fs player|no=21|pos=|nat=New Zealand|name= Kobi Hislop|other=Squad Player}}\n{{Fs end}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[:Category:Moturoa AFC players|Moturoa AFC players]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Association football clubs in New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Sport in New Plymouth]]\n", "name_user": "BG Onuku", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moturoa_AFC"}

Mrs. George Zabriskie Gray of New York sent $3,000 in memory of her daughter Grace then another $2,000 of which $1,000 was designated to build a ward for African-Americans. Rev. Hughson took charge of the project, and the first Grace Hospital was built on King Street in Morganton across from the Episcopal rectory. The hospital opened on Aug. 1, 1906, with two white wards, one male and one female, with four beds each and a crib and an annex for black patients with two wards of four beds each.

The organisation is known as the ''Liechtensteiner Fussballverband'' in [[German language|German]]. The team's first match was an unofficial match against [[Malta national football team|Malta]] in [[Seoul]], a 1\u20131 draw in 1981. Their first official match came two years later, a 0\u20131 defeat from [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]]. Liechtenstein's largest win, a 4\u20130 win over [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]] in a [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] qualifier on 13 October 2004, was both its first ever away win and its first win in any [[FIFA World Cup]] qualifier. Conversely, Liechtenstein is the only country that lost an official match against [[San Marino national football team|San Marino]]. Liechtenstein suffered its biggest ever loss in 1996, during qualification for the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], losing 1\u201311 to [[North Macedonia national football team|Macedonia]], the result also being Macedonia's largest ever win to date.\n\n==History==\nLiechtenstein are only a relatively recent affiliate to [[FIFA]], and did not participate in any qualifying series until the [[UEFA Euro 1996]] qualifiers. There they managed to surprise the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] by holding them to a 0\u20130 draw on 3 June 1995. On 14 October 1998, they managed their first victory in a qualifying campaign after winning 2\u20131 against [[Azerbaijan national football team|Azerbaijan]] in a [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]] qualifying match.\n\nSince then, the presence of Liechtenstein clubs in the Swiss league system and of a handful of professional players (most notably [[Mario Frick (football player)|Mario Frick]]) has seen the side's competitiveness improve slightly. The [[UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying|Euro 2004 qualifiers]] saw Liechtenstein improve to the extent they restricted [[England national football team|England]] to 2\u20130 wins. The [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2006 World Cup qualifiers]], however, brought even better results as two wins over [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]] and draws against both [[Slovakia national football team|Slovakia]] and [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] meant that Liechtenstein finished with 8 points.\n\nIn the Euro 2008 qualifiers, Liechtenstein beat [[Latvia national football team|Latvia]] through a solitary goal from Mario Frick. The result caused the Latvian manager to resign after the match. They repeated their heroics against [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]] managing to beat them 3\u20130 on 17 October 2007 for their second qualifying group win. On the 26 March 2008 Liechtenstein had an embarrassing 7\u20131 loss to fellow small nation in Europe, [[Malta national football team|Malta]]. This was recorded as Malta's largest win.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20080326/sport/malta-beat-liechtenstein-7-1.201675|title=Malta beat Liechtenstein 7-1|last=Ltd|first=Allied Newspapers|work=Times of Malta|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nThe Liechtensteiner Fussballverbund voted [[Rainer Hasler]] to be their \"Golden Player\" &mdash; their best player over the last 50 years &mdash; to mark UEFA's golden jubilee.\n\nIn the 2010 World Cup qualifiers, Liechtenstein secured a scoreless draw against [[Azerbaijan national football team|Azerbaijan]] and a 1\u20131 draw against [[Finland national football team|Finland]], finishing bottom of Group 4 on two points.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eu-football.info/_match.php?id=1149|title=Liechtenstein and Finland football teams played to a 1:1 draw, 9 September 2009|website=eu-football.info|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}</ref>\n\nIn the Euro 2012 qualifiers, Liechtenstein were narrowly beaten 2\u20131 by [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] in [[Hampden Park]] thanks to a goal by [[Stephen McManus]] in the seventh minute of additional time.<ref name = \"euro 2012\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/scotland/15078473.stm|title=Liechtenstein missing goal hero Philippe Erne|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|date=27 September 2011|accessdate=27 September 2011}}</ref> They produced a shock 2&ndash;0 win at home against [[Lithuania national football team|Lithuania]]; their goals were scored by [[Philippe Erne]] and [[Michele Polverino]].<ref name = \"euro 2012\"/> In the following qualifying game, they managed a scoreless draw away to Lithuania.<ref name = \"euro 2012\"/>\n\nIn 2018, Liechtenstein entered the first ever [[UEFA Nations League]], in group 4 of league D.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uefa.com/uefanationsleague/season=2019/standings/#/ld|title=UEFA Nations League - Standings|last=UEFA.com|website=UEFA.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}</ref> Their first Nations League match saw [[Armenia national football team|Armenia]] beat them 2\u20130 away.

The organisation is known as the ''Liechtensteiner Fussballverband'' in [[German language|German]]. The team's first match was an unofficial match against [[Malta national football team|Malta]] in [[Seoul]], a 1\u20131 draw in 1981. Their first official match came two years later, a 0\u20131 defeat from [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]]. Liechtenstein's largest win, a 4\u20130 win over [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]] in a [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] qualifier on 13 October 2004, was both its first ever away win and its first win in any [[FIFA World Cup]] qualifier. Conversely, Liechtenstein is the only country that lost an official match against [[San Marino national football team|San Marino]]. Liechtenstein suffered its biggest ever loss in 1996, during qualification for the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], losing 1\u201311 to [[North Macedonia national football team|Macedonia]], the result also being Macedonia's largest ever win to date.\n\n==History==\nLiechtenstein are only a relatively recent affiliate to [[FIFA]], and did not participate in any qualifying series until the [[UEFA Euro 1996]] qualifiers. There they managed to surprise the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] by holding them to a 0\u20130 draw on 3 June 1995. On 14 October 1998, they managed their first victory in a qualifying campaign after winning 2\u20131 against [[Azerbaijan national football team|Azerbaijan]] in a [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]] qualifying match.\n\nSince then, the presence of Liechtenstein clubs in the Swiss league system and of a handful of professional players (most notably [[Mario Frick (football player)|Mario Frick]]) has seen the side's competitiveness improve slightly. The [[UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying|Euro 2004 qualifiers]] saw Liechtenstein improve to the extent they restricted [[England national football team|England]] to 2\u20130 wins. The [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2006 World Cup qualifiers]], however, brought even better results as two wins over [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]] and draws against both [[Slovakia national football team|Slovakia]] and [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] meant that Liechtenstein finished with 8 points.\n\nIn the Euro 2008 qualifiers, Liechtenstein beat [[Latvia national football team|Latvia]] through a solitary goal from Mario Frick. The result caused the Latvian manager to resign after the match. They repeated their heroics against [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]] managing to beat them 3\u20130 on 17 October 2007 for their second qualifying group win. On the 26 March 2008 Liechtenstein had an embarrassing 7\u20131 loss to fellow small nation in Europe, [[Malta national football team|Malta]]. This was recorded as Malta's largest win.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20080326/sport/malta-beat-liechtenstein-7-1.201675|title=Malta beat Liechtenstein 7-1|last=Ltd|first=Allied Newspapers|work=Times of Malta|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nThe Liechtensteiner Fussballverbund voted [[Rainer Hasler]] to be their \"Golden Player\" &mdash; their best player over the last 50 years &mdash; to mark UEFA's golden jubilee.\n\nIn the 2010 World Cup qualifiers Liechtenstein secured a scoreless draw against [[Azerbaijan national football team|Azerbaijan]] and a 1\u20131 draw against [[Finland national football team|Finland]], finishing bottom of Group 4 on two points.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eu-football.info/_match.php?id=1149|title=Liechtenstein and Finland football teams played to a 1:1 draw, 9 September 2009|website=eu-football.info|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}</ref>\n\nIn the Euro 2012 qualifiers, Liechtenstein were narrowly beaten 2\u20131 by [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] in [[Hampden Park]] thanks to a goal by [[Stephen McManus]] in the seventh minute of additional time.<ref name = \"euro 2012\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/scotland/15078473.stm|title=Liechtenstein missing goal hero Philippe Erne|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|date=27 September 2011|accessdate=27 September 2011}}</ref> They produced a shock 2&ndash;0 win at home against [[Lithuania national football team|Lithuania]]; their goals were scored by [[Philippe Erne]] and [[Michele Polverino]].<ref name = \"euro 2012\"/> In the following qualifying game they managed a scoreless draw away to Lithuania.<ref name = \"euro 2012\"/>\n\nIn 2018, Liechtenstein entered the first ever [[UEFA Nations League]], in group 4 of league D.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uefa.com/uefanationsleague/season=2019/standings/#/ld|title=UEFA Nations League - Standings|last=UEFA.com|website=UEFA.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}</ref> Their first Nations League match saw [[Armenia national football team|Armenia]] beat them 2\u20130 away.

The property is under 24-hour surveillance by on-site security.\n\nAs of November 2019, the following structures still stand: Sears, Sears Auto Center, former NTB building, JCPenney, Main Mall/outlet center, Macy's, Staples, Firestone, and a small shopping center southeast of the main building which currently houses a Mexican grocery market and a small operation gun shop.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{ccat|Westland Mall}}\n*[https://abandonedonline.net/location/westland-mall/ Westland] at Abandoned\n*[http://www.deadmalls.com/malls/westland_mall.html Westland] at DeadMalls.com\n*[http://www.labelscar.com/ohio/westland-mall Westland] at Label Scar\n\n{{Columbus, Ohio}}\n{{Shopping malls in Ohio}}\n\n[[Category:Shopping malls in Columbus, Ohio]]\n[[Category:1969 establishments in Ohio]]\n[[Category:Shopping malls established in 1969]]\n[[Category:2012 disestablishments in Ohio]]\n[[Category:Shopping malls disestablished in 2012]]\n[[Category:Abandoned shopping malls in the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Davemck", "label": "safe", "comment": "rmv duplicate parm", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westland_Mall_(Columbus,_Ohio)"}
