All [[matter]] exhibits [[wave]]-like behavior. For example, a beam of [[electron]]s can be [[diffraction|diffracted]] just like a beam of light or a water wave. In most cases, however, the wavelength is too small to have a practical impact on day-to-day activities. Hence in our day-to-day lives with objects the size of tennis balls and people, matter waves are not relevant.\n\nThe concept that matter behaves like a wave was proposed by [[Louis de Broglie]] ({{IPAc-en|d|\u0259|\u02c8|b|r|\u0254\u026a}}) in 1924. It is also referred to as the ''de Broglie hypothesis''.<ref>[[Richard Feynman|Feynman, R.]], ''[[QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter]]'', Penguin 1990 Edition, p. 84.</ref> Matter waves are referred to as ''de Broglie waves''.\n\nThe ''de Broglie wavelength'' is the [[wavelength]], {{math|''\u03bb''}}, associated with a massive particle (i.e., a particle with mass, as opposed to a massless particle) and is related to its [[momentum]], {{math|''p''}}, through the [[Planck constant]], {{math|''h''}}:\n:<math> \\lambda = \\frac{h}{p}=\\frac{h}{mv}.</math>\n\nWave-like behavior of matter was first experimentally demonstrated by [[George Paget Thomson]]'s thin metal diffraction experiment,<ref name=GPTdiff>{{cite journal | author = Thomson, G.

In 1900, this division was exposed to doubt, when, investigating the theory of [[black-body radiation]], [[Max Planck]] proposed that light is emitted in discrete quanta of energy. It was thoroughly challenged in 1905. Extending Planck's investigation in several ways, including its connection with the [[photoelectric effect]], [[Albert Einstein]] proposed that light is also propagated and absorbed in quanta; now called [[photon]]s. These quanta would have an energy given by the [[Planck\u2013Einstein relation]]:\n:<math>E=h\\nu</math>\nand a momentum\n:<math>p=\\frac{E}{c}=\\frac{h}{\\lambda}</math>\nwhere {{math|''\u03bd''}} (lowercase [[Nu (letter)|Greek letter nu]]) and {{math|''\u03bb''}} (lowercase [[Lambda|Greek letter lambda]]) denote the frequency and wavelength of the light, {{math|''c''}} the speed of light, and {{math|''h''}} the [[Planck constant]].<ref>[[Albert Einstein|Einstein, A.]] (1917).

Furthermore, neutral atoms and even molecules have been shown to be wave-like.\n\n===Electrons===\n{{further|Davisson\u2013Germer experiment|Electron diffraction}}\nIn 1927 at Bell Labs, [[Clinton Davisson]] and [[Lester Germer]] [[Davisson\u2013Germer experiment|fired]] slow-moving [[electron]]s at a [[crystal]]line [[nickel]] target. The angular dependence of the diffracted electron intensity was measured, and was determined to have the same [[diffraction|diffraction pattern]] as those predicted by [[William Lawrence Bragg|Bragg]] for [[x-ray]]s. At the same time George Paget Thomson at the University of Aberdeen was independently firing electrons at very thin metal foils to demonstrate the same effect.<ref name=GPTdiff/> Before the acceptance of the de Broglie hypothesis, diffraction was a property that was thought to be exhibited only by waves. Therefore, the presence of any [[diffraction]] effects by matter demonstrated the wave-like nature of matter. When the de Broglie wavelength was inserted into the [[Bragg's law|Bragg condition]], the observed diffraction pattern was predicted, thereby experimentally confirming the de Broglie hypothesis for electrons.<ref>Mauro Dardo, ''Nobel Laureates and Twentieth-Century Physics'', Cambridge University Press 2004, pp. 156\u2013157</ref>\n\nThis was a pivotal result in the development of [[quantum mechanics]]. Just as the [[photoelectric effect]] demonstrated the particle nature of light, the [[Davisson\u2013Germer experiment]] showed the wave-nature of matter, and completed the theory of [[wave\u2013particle duality]]. For [[physicist]]s this idea was important because it meant that not only could any particle exhibit wave characteristics, but that one could use [[wave equation]]s to describe phenomena in matter if one used the de Broglie wavelength.\n\n===Neutral atoms===\n{{further|Atom optics}}\nExperiments with [[Fresnel diffraction]]<ref name=\"doak\">\n{{cite journal\n | author=R.B.Doak\n | date=1999\n | author2=R.E.Grisenti |author3=S.Rehbein |author4=G.Schmahl |author5=J.P.Toennies |author6=Ch.

Group velocity (equal to the particle's speed) should not be confused with [[phase velocity]] (equal to the product of the particle's frequency and its wavelength). In the case of a non-[[dispersion relation|dispersive medium]], they happen to be equal, but otherwise they are not.\n\n====Group velocity====\n[[Albert Einstein]] first explained the [[wave\u2013particle duality]] of light in 1905.  [[Louis de Broglie]] hypothesized that any particle should also exhibit such a duality. The velocity of a particle, he concluded, should always equal the group velocity of the corresponding wave. The magnitude of the group velocity is equal to the particle's speed.\n\nBoth in relativistic and non-relativistic quantum physics, we can identify the group velocity of a particle's wave function with the particle velocity.  [[Quantum mechanics]] has very accurately demonstrated this hypothesis, and the relation has been shown explicitly for particles as large as [[molecule]]s.<ref name=\"Arndt 680\u2013682\"/>\n\nDe Broglie deduced that if the duality equations already known for light were the same for any particle, then his hypothesis would hold.  This means that\n\n:<math>v_g = \\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial k} = \\frac{\\partial (E/\\hbar)}{\\partial (p/\\hbar)} = \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial p}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''E''}} is the total [[energy]] of the particle, {{math|''p''}} is its [[momentum]], {{math|''\u0127''}} is the reduced Planck constant. For a free non-relativistic particle it follows that\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  v_g &= \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial p} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{p^2}{m} \\right)\\\\\n    &= \\frac{p}{m}\\\\\n    &= v\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''m''}} is the [[mass]] of the particle and {{math|''v''}} its velocity.\n\nAlso in [[special relativity]] we find that\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  v_g &= \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial p} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p} \\left( \\sqrt{p^2c^2+m_0^2c^4} \\right)\\\\\n    &= \\frac{pc^2}{\\sqrt{p^2c^2 + m_0^2c^4}}\\\\\n    &= \\frac{pc^2}{E}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''m''<sub>0</sub>}} is the rest mass of the particle and {{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum. But (see below), using that the phase velocity is {{math|''v''<sub>''p''</sub> {{=}} ''E''/''p'' {{=}} ''c''<sup>2</sup>/''v''}}, therefore\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  v_g &= \\frac{pc^2}{E}\\\\\n    &= \\frac{c^2}{v_p}\\\\\n    &= v\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''v''}} is the velocity of the particle regardless of wave behavior.\n\n====Phase velocity====\nIn [[quantum mechanics]], particles also behave as waves with [[complex number|complex]] phases. The [[phase velocity]] is equal to the product of the frequency multiplied by the wavelength.\n\nBy the de Broglie hypothesis, we see that\n\n:<math>v_\\mathrm{p} = \\frac{\\omega}{k} = \\frac{E/\\hbar}{p/\\hbar} = \\frac{E}{p}. </math>\n\nUsing [[special relativity|relativistic]] relations for energy and momentum, we have\n\n:<math>v_\\mathrm{p} = \\frac{E}{p} = \\frac{m c^2}{m v} = \\frac{\\gamma m_0 c^2}{\\gamma m_0 v} = \\frac{c^2}{v} = \\frac{c}{\\beta}</math>\n\nwhere ''E'' is the total energy of the particle (i.e. [[Invariant mass#Rest energy|rest energy]] plus [[kinetic energy]] in the [[Kinematics|kinematic]] sense), ''p'' the [[momentum]], <math>\\gamma</math> the [[Lorentz factor]], ''c'' the [[speed of light]], and \u03b2 the speed as a fraction of ''c''. The variable ''v'' can either be taken to be the speed of the particle or the group velocity of the corresponding matter wave. Since the particle speed <math>v < c </math> for any particle that has mass (according to [[special relativity]]), the phase velocity of matter waves always exceeds ''c'', i.e.\n\n:<math>v_\\mathrm{p} > c, \\,</math>\n\nand as we can see, it approaches ''c'' when the particle speed is in the relativistic range. The [[Faster-than-light|superluminal]] phase velocity does not violate special relativity, because phase propagation carries no energy. See the article on ''[[Dispersion (optics)#Group and phase velocity|Dispersion (optics)]]'' for details.\n\n===Four-vectors===\n{{Main|Four-vector}}\n\nUsing four-vectors, the De Broglie relations form a single equation:\n\n<math>\\mathbf{P}= \\hbar\\mathbf{K}</math>\n\nwhich is [[Inertial frame of reference|frame]]-independent.\n\nLikewise, the relation between group/particle velocity and phase velocity is given in frame-independent form by:\n\n<math>\\mathbf{K} = \\left(\\frac{\\omega_o}{c^2}\\right)\\mathbf{U}</math>\n\nwhere\n:[[Four-momentum]] <math>\\mathbf{P} = \\left(\\frac{E}{c}, \\vec{\\mathbf{p}} \\right)</math>\n\n:[[Four-vector#Four-wavevector|Four-wavevector]] <math>\\mathbf{K} = \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{c}, \\vec{\\mathbf{k}} \\right) = \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{c}, \\frac{\\omega}{v_p}\\mathbf{\\hat{n}} \\right)</math>\n\n:[[Four-velocity]] <math>\\mathbf{U} = \\gamma(c,\\vec{\\mathbf{u}}) = \\gamma(c,v_g \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}) </math>\n\n==Interpretations==\n{{Disputed section|date=February 2020}}\nThe physical reality underlying de Broglie waves is a subject of ongoing debate. Some theories treat either the particle or the wave aspect as its fundamental nature, seeking to explain the other as an [[Emergence|emergent property]]. Some, such as the [[hidden variable theory]], treat the wave and the particle as distinct entities. Yet others propose some intermediate entity that is neither quite wave nor quite particle but only appears as such when we measure one or the other property. The [[Copenhagen interpretation]] states that the nature of the underlying reality is unknowable and beyond the bounds of scientific inquiry.\n\nSchr\u00f6dinger's quantum mechanical waves are conceptually different from ordinary physical waves such as water or sound. Ordinary physical waves are characterized by undulating real-number 'displacements' of dimensioned physical variables at each point of ordinary physical space at each instant of time. Schr\u00f6dinger's \"waves\" are characterized by the undulating value of a dimensionless complex number at each point of an abstract multi-dimensional space, for example of configuration space.\n\nAt the Fifth Solvay Conference in 1927, [[Max Born]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]] reported as follows:\n\n{{quote|If one wishes to calculate the probabilities of excitation and ionization of atoms [M. Born, Zur Quantenmechanik der Stossvorgange, ''Z. f.

The waves then propagate no longer in three-dimensional space but in multi-dimensional configuration space. From this one sees that the quantum mechanical waves are indeed something quite different from the light waves of the classical theory.<ref>[[Max Born|Born, M.]], [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1928).

The first, which follows on directly from the famous doctoral thesis by L. de Broglie, concerns waves in three-dimensional space. Because of the strictly relativistic treatment that is adopted in this version from the outset, we shall refer to it as the ''four-dimensional'' wave mechanics. The other theory is more remote from Mr de Broglie's original ideas, insofar as it is based on a wave-like process in the space of ''position coordinates'' (''q''-space) of an arbitrary mechanical system.[Long footnote about manuscript not copied here.] We shall therefore call it the ''multi-dimensional'' wave mechanics. Of course this use of the ''q''-space is to be seen only as a mathematical tool, as it is often applied also in the old mechanics; ultimately, in this version also, the process to be described is one in space and time. In truth, however, a complete unification of the two conceptions has not yet been achieved. Anything over and above the motion of a single electron could be treated so far only in the ''multi''-dimensional version; also, this is the one that provides the mathematical solution to the problems posed by the Heisenberg-Born matrix mechanics.<ref>[[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger|Schr\u00f6dinger, E.]] (1928).

Phys.'', '''37''': 863, 1926 and '''38''': 803, 1926] in the summer of 1926. In this work, the wave in configuration space was interpreted as a probability wave, in order to explain collision processes on Schr\u00f6dinger's theory. This hypothesis contained two important new features in comparison with that of [[Niels Bohr|Bohr]], [[Hans Kramers|Kramers]] and [[John C. Slater|Slater]]. The first of these was the assertion that, in considering \"probability waves\", we are concerned with processes not in ordinary three-dimensional space, but in an abstract configuration space (a fact which is, unfortunately, sometimes overlooked even today); the second was the recognition that the probability wave is related to an individual process.<ref>[[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1955).

Weisskopf]], Pergamon Press, London, p. 13.</ref>}}\n\nIt is mentioned above that the \"displaced quantity\" of the Schr\u00f6dinger wave has values that are dimensionless complex numbers. One may ask what is the physical meaning of those numbers. According to Heisenberg, rather than being of some ordinary physical quantity such as, for example, Maxwell's electric field intensity, or mass density, the Schr\u00f6dinger-wave packet's \"displaced quantity\" is probability amplitude. He wrote that instead of using the term 'wave packet', it is preferable to speak of a probability packet.<ref>[[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1927). \u00dcber den anschlaulichen Inhalt der quantentheoretischen Kinematik und Mechanik, ''Z.

Hoyt, University of Chicago Press, Chicago IL, pp. 77\u201378.</ref> Thus one does not need necessarily think of the matter wave, as it were, as 'composed of smeared matter'.\n\nThese ideas may be expressed in ordinary language as follows. In the account of ordinary physical waves, a 'point' refers to a position in ordinary physical space at an instant of time, at which there is specified a 'displacement' of some physical quantity. But in the account of quantum mechanics, a 'point' refers to a configuration of the system at an instant of time, every particle of the system being in a sense present in every 'point' of configuration space, each particle at such a 'point' being located possibly at a different position in ordinary physical space. There is no explicit definite indication that, at an instant, this particle is 'here' and that particle is 'there' in some separate 'location' in configuration space. This conceptual difference entails that, in contrast to de Broglie's pre-quantum mechanical wave description, the quantum mechanical probability packet description does not directly and explicitly express the Aristotelian idea, referred to by Newton, that causal efficacy propagates through ordinary space by contact, nor the Einsteinian idea that such propagation is no faster than light. In contrast, these ideas are so expressed in the classical wave account, through the [[Green's function]], though it is inadequate for the observed quantal phenomena. The physical reasoning for this was first recognized by Einstein.<ref>Fine, A. (1986).

All [[matter]] exhibits [[wave]]-like behavior. For example, a beam of [[electron]]s can be [[diffraction|diffracted]] just like a beam of light or a water wave. In most cases, however, the wavelength is too small to have a practical impact on day-to-day activities. Hence in our day-to-day lives with objects the size of tennis balls and people, matter waves are not relevant.\n\nThe concept that matter behaves like a wave was proposed by [[Louis de Broglie]] ({{IPAc-en|d|\u0259|\u02c8|b|r|\u0254\u026a}}) in 1924.

In 1900, this division was exposed to doubt, when, investigating the theory of [[black-body radiation]], [[Max Planck]] proposed that light is emitted in discrete quanta of energy. It was thoroughly challenged in 1905. Extending Planck's investigation in several ways, including its connection with the [[photoelectric effect]], [[Albert Einstein]] proposed that light is also propagated and absorbed in quanta; now called [[photon]]s. These quanta would have an energy given by the [[Planck\u2013Einstein relation]]:\n:<math>E=h\\nu</math>\nand a momentum\n:<math>p=\\frac{E}{c}=\\frac{h}{\\lambda}</math>\nwhere {{math|''\u03bd''}} (lowercase [[Nu (letter)|Greek letter nu]]) and {{math|''\u03bb''}} (lowercase [[Lambda|Greek letter lambda]]) denote the frequency and wavelength of the light, {{math|''c''}} the speed of light, and {{math|''h''}} the [[Planck constant]].<ref>[[Albert Einstein|Einstein, A.]] (1917).

Group velocity (equal to the particle's speed) should not be confused with [[phase velocity]] (equal to the product of the particle's frequency and its wavelength). In the case of a non-[[dispersion relation|dispersive medium]], they happen to be equal, but otherwise they are not.\n\n====Group velocity====\n[[Albert Einstein]] first explained the [[wave\u2013particle duality]] of light in 1905.  [[Louis de Broglie]] hypothesized that any particle should also exhibit such a duality. The velocity of a particle, he concluded, should always equal the group velocity of the corresponding wave. The magnitude of the group velocity is equal to the particle's speed.\n\nBoth in relativistic and non-relativistic quantum physics, we can identify the group velocity of a particle's wave function with the particle velocity.  [[Quantum mechanics]] has very accurately demonstrated this hypothesis, and the relation has been shown explicitly for particles as large as [[molecule]]s.<ref name=\"Arndt 680\u2013682\"/>\n\nDe Broglie deduced that if the duality equations already known for light were the same for any particle, then his hypothesis would hold.  This means that\n\n:<math>v_g = \\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial k} = \\frac{\\partial (E/\\hbar)}{\\partial (p/\\hbar)} = \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial p}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''E''}} is the total [[energy]] of the particle, {{math|''p''}} is its [[momentum]], {{math|''\u0127''}} is the reduced Planck constant. For a free non-relativistic particle it follows that\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  v_g &= \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial p} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{p^2}{m} \\right)\\\\\n    &= \\frac{p}{m}\\\\\n    &= v\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''m''}} is the [[mass]] of the particle and {{math|''v''}} its velocity.\n\nAlso in [[special relativity]] we find that\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  v_g &= \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial p} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p} \\left( \\sqrt{p^2c^2+m_0^2c^4} \\right)\\\\\n    &= \\frac{pc^2}{\\sqrt{p^2c^2 + m_0^2c^4}}\\\\\n    &= \\frac{pc^2}{E}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''m''<sub>0</sub>}} is the rest mass of the particle and {{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum. But (see below), using that the phase velocity is {{math|''v''<sub>''p''</sub> {{=}} ''E''/''p'' {{=}} ''c''<sup>2</sup>/''v''}}, therefore\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  v_g &= \\frac{pc^2}{E}\\\\\n    &= \\frac{c^2}{v_p}\\\\\n    &= v\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''v''}} is the velocity of the particle regardless of wave behavior.\n\n====Phase velocity====\nIn [[quantum mechanics]], particles also behave as waves with [[complex number|complex]] phases. The [[phase velocity]] is equal to the product of the frequency multiplied by the wavelength.\n\nBy the de Broglie hypothesis, we see that\n\n:<math>v_\\mathrm{p} = \\frac{\\omega}{k} = \\frac{E/\\hbar}{p/\\hbar} = \\frac{E}{p}. </math>\n\nUsing [[special relativity|relativistic]] relations for energy and momentum, we have\n\n:<math>v_\\mathrm{p} = \\frac{E}{p} = \\frac{m c^2}{m v} = \\frac{\\gamma m_0 c^2}{\\gamma m_0 v} = \\frac{c^2}{v} = \\frac{c}{\\beta}</math>\n\nwhere ''E'' is the total energy of the particle (i.e. [[Invariant mass#Rest energy|rest energy]] plus [[kinetic energy]] in the [[Kinematics|kinematic]] sense), ''p'' the [[momentum]], <math>\\gamma</math> the [[Lorentz factor]], ''c'' the [[speed of light]], and \u03b2 the speed as a fraction of ''c''. The variable ''v'' can either be taken to be the speed of the particle or the group velocity of the corresponding matter wave. Since the particle speed <math>v < c </math> for any particle that has mass (according to [[special relativity]]), the phase velocity of matter waves always exceeds ''c'', i.e.\n\n:<math>v_\\mathrm{p} > c, \\,</math>\n\nand as we can see, it approaches ''c'' when the particle speed is in the relativistic range. The [[Faster-than-light|superluminal]] phase velocity does not violate special relativity, because phase propagation carries no energy. See the article on ''[[Dispersion (optics)#Group and phase velocity|Dispersion (optics)]]'' for details.\n\n===Four-vectors===\n{{Main|Four-vector}}\n\nUsing four-vectors, the De Broglie relations form a single equation:\n\n<math>\\mathbf{P}= \\hbar\\mathbf{K}</math>\n\nwhich is [[Inertial frame of reference|frame]]-independent.\n\nLikewise, the relation between group/particle velocity and phase velocity is given in frame-independent form by:\n\n<math>\\mathbf{K} = \\left(\\frac{\\omega_o}{c^2}\\right)\\mathbf{U}</math>\n\nwhere\n:[[Four-momentum]] <math>\\mathbf{P} = \\left(\\frac{E}{c}, \\vec{\\mathbf{p}} \\right)</math>\n\n:[[Four-vector#Four-wavevector|Four-wavevector]] <math>\\mathbf{K} = \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{c}, \\vec{\\mathbf{k}} \\right) = \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{c}, \\frac{\\omega}{v_p}\\mathbf{\\hat{n}} \\right)</math>\n\n:[[Four-velocity]] <math>\\mathbf{U} = \\gamma(c,\\vec{\\mathbf{u}}) = \\gamma(c,v_g \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}) </math>\n\n==Interpretations==\n{{Disputed section|date=February 2020}}\nThe physical reality underlying de Broglie waves is a subject of ongoing debate. Some theories treat either the particle or the wave aspect as its fundamental nature, seeking to explain the other as an [[Emergence|emergent property]]. Some, such as the [[hidden variable theory]], treat the wave and the particle as distinct entities. Yet others propose some intermediate entity that is neither quite wave nor quite particle but only appears as such when we measure one or the other property. The [[Copenhagen interpretation]] states that the nature of the underlying reality is unknowable and beyond the bounds of scientific inquiry.\n\nSchr\u00f6dinger's quantum mechanical waves are conceptually different from ordinary physical waves such as water or sound. Ordinary physical waves are characterized by undulating real-number 'displacements' of dimensioned physical variables at each point of ordinary physical space at each instant of time. Schr\u00f6dinger's \"waves\" are characterized by the undulating value of a dimensionless complex number at each point of an abstract multi-dimensional space, for example of configuration space.\n\nAt the Fifth Solvay Conference in 1927, [[Max Born]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]] reported as follows:\n\n{{quote|If one wishes to calculate the probabilities of excitation and ionization of atoms [M. Born, Zur Quantenmechanik der Stossvorgange, ''Z. f. Phys.'', '''37''' (1926), 863; [Quantenmechanik der Stossvorgange], ''ibid.'', '''38''' (1926), 803] then one must introduce the coordinates of the atomic electrons as variables on an equal footing with those of the colliding electron. The waves then propagate no longer in three-dimensional space but in multi-dimensional configuration space. From this one sees that the quantum mechanical waves are indeed something quite different from the light waves of the classical theory.<ref>[[Max Born|Born, M.]], [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1928).

The first, which follows on directly from the famous doctoral thesis by L. de Broglie, concerns waves in three-dimensional space. Because of the strictly relativistic treatment that is adopted in this version from the outset, we shall refer to it as the ''four-dimensional'' wave mechanics. The other theory is more remote from Mr de Broglie's original ideas, insofar as it is based on a wave-like process in the space of ''position coordinates'' (''q''-space) of an arbitrary mechanical system.[Long footnote about manuscript not copied here.] We shall therefore call it the ''multi-dimensional'' wave mechanics. Of course this use of the ''q''-space is to be seen only as a mathematical tool, as it is often applied also in the old mechanics; ultimately, in this version also, the process to be described is one in space and time. In truth, however, a complete unification of the two conceptions has not yet been achieved. Anything over and above the motion of a single electron could be treated so far only in the ''multi''-dimensional version; also, this is the one that provides the mathematical solution to the problems posed by the Heisenberg-Born matrix mechanics.<ref>[[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger|Schr\u00f6dinger, E.]] (1928).

Phys.'', '''37''': 863, 1926 and '''38''': 803, 1926] in the summer of 1926. In this work, the wave in configuration space was interpreted as a probability wave, in order to explain collision processes on Schr\u00f6dinger's theory. This hypothesis contained two important new features in comparison with that of [[Niels Bohr|Bohr]], [[Hans Kramers|Kramers]] and [[John C. Slater|Slater]]. The first of these was the assertion that, in considering \"probability waves\", we are concerned with processes not in ordinary three-dimensional space, but in an abstract configuration space (a fact which is, unfortunately, sometimes overlooked even today); the second was the recognition that the probability wave is related to an individual process.<ref>[[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1955).

Pauli]], with the assistance of [[L\u00e9on Rosenfeld|L. Rosenfeld]] and [[Victor Weisskopf|V. Weisskopf]], Pergamon Press, London, p. 13.</ref>}}\n\nIt is mentioned above that the \"displaced quantity\" of the Schr\u00f6dinger wave has values that are dimensionless complex numbers. One may ask what is the physical meaning of those numbers. According to Heisenberg, rather than being of some ordinary physical quantity such as, for example, Maxwell's electric field intensity, or mass density, the Schr\u00f6dinger-wave packet's \"displaced quantity\" is probability amplitude. He wrote that instead of using the term 'wave packet', it is preferable to speak of a probability packet.<ref>[[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1927). \u00dcber den anschlaulichen Inhalt der quantentheoretischen Kinematik und Mechanik, ''Z.

Heisenberg recites Duane's account of particle diffraction by probabilistic quantal translation momentum transfer, which allows, for example in Young's two-slit experiment, each diffracted particle probabilistically to pass discretely through a particular slit.<ref>[[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1930). ''The Physical Principles of the Quantum Theory'', translated by C. Eckart, F. C. Hoyt, University of Chicago Press, Chicago IL, pp. 77\u201378.</ref> Thus one does not need necessarily think of the matter wave, as it were, as 'composed of smeared matter'.\n\nThese ideas may be expressed in ordinary language as follows. In the account of ordinary physical waves, a 'point' refers to a position in ordinary physical space at an instant of time, at which there is specified a 'displacement' of some physical quantity. But in the account of quantum mechanics, a 'point' refers to a configuration of the system at an instant of time, every particle of the system being in a sense present in every 'point' of configuration space, each particle at such a 'point' being located possibly at a different position in ordinary physical space. There is no explicit definite indication that, at an instant, this particle is 'here' and that particle is 'there' in some separate 'location' in configuration space. This conceptual difference entails that, in contrast to de Broglie's pre-quantum mechanical wave description, the quantum mechanical probability packet description does not directly and explicitly express the Aristotelian idea, referred to by Newton, that causal efficacy propagates through ordinary space by contact, nor the Einsteinian idea that such propagation is no faster than light. In contrast, these ideas are so expressed in the classical wave account, through the [[Green's function]], though it is inadequate for the observed quantal phenomena. The physical reasoning for this was first recognized by Einstein.<ref>Fine, A. (1986).

Following the demolition of old [[Beijing-Hankou Railway]], the city of [[Wuhan]] planned to utilize the corridor to construct the city's first rapid transit rail line. In September 1992, the [[Wuhan Metro Construction Group]] was established by [[Wuhan Municipal Construction Commission]] and a supervision group, led by the mayor [[Qian Yunlu]], was subsequently formed in 1993 to facilitate the project's funding, planning, logistics, and organization. Yet, it was seven years before the city was able to fund construction.\n\nIn October 1999, the [[National Development and Reform Commission|National Planning Commission]] (predecessor of the National Development and Reform Commission) approved the Wuhan \"Light Rail\" project (Line 1, phase 1), signaling the start of serious work on the rail transit project. On October 2, 2000, the [[Wuhan|Wuhan Municipal Government]] ratified the establishment of the [[Wuhan Rail Transit Co., Ltd]]., and contracted construction, operation, administration and related real estate development to the corporation.\n\nIn December 2000, the National Planning Commission accepted a feasibility report on the project and approved construction on phase 1 of Line 1. On December 23, 2000, the project broke ground and comprehensive construction began.\n\nIn 2002, with the anticipation of an economic boom and increasing demand for urban rail transit, Wuhan Municipal Government approved the city's first long-term rail transit master plan. On July 28, 2004, the ten-station long \"light rail\" line was opened to the public and entered revenue service in August. However, low ridership discouraged the city from funding the extension project, for which ground had been broken on December 15, 2005, and a 4-year delay in construction ensued. In April, 2006, the [[National Development and Reform Commission|NDRC]] ratified a six-year construction/operation plan, but it was not until a year later on April 9, 2007 that NDRC accepted the feasibility report for line 1, phase 2 (the extension project) and approved construction on the project.\n\nIn the interim, construction began on the [[Fanhu station]] of the fully underground line 2 on November 16, 2006, as a response to the six-year plan adopted by NDRC earlier. Construction also began on the underground line 4 stations of [[Wuchang railway station]] in June, and [[Wuhan railway station]] in September, as parts of the integral capital project to revamp and construct the [[Wuhan Railway Hub System|Wuhan Railway Hub]].\n\nIn May 2007, the [[Hubei Provincial Development and Reform Commission]] (HDRC) approved preliminary designs on the Line 1, phase 2, and comprehensive construction subsequently commenced in June. On May 15, the city government approved the establishment of [[Wuhan Metro Co., Ltd]]., which would replace the [[Wuhan Rail Transit Co., Ltd]] and assume its responsibilities and benefits.\n\nOn September 12, 2007, the NDRC accepted the feasibility report to Line 2, phase 1, and preliminary designs were approved by the HDRC in December 2007. However, it was not until September 2008 that land purchases and funding were facilitated and comprehensive construction began to take place. In October 2009, drilling of the [[Yangtze River]] tunnel started.\n\nOn March 13, 2009, the NDRC accepted feasibility report to Line 4, phase 1. On May 13, 2009, the HDRC ratified preliminary designs on Line 4, phase 1. Comprehensive construction ensued on the [[Wuchang District|Wuchang]] segment of Line 4. A more ambitious urban rapid transit plan was submitted for NDRC review in October, 2009, and in late November, on-site panel investigations were conducted by [[China International Engineering Consulting Corporation]].\n\nIn February 2010 (Wuhan Metro)'s first commercial property topped out in [[Hanxi 1st Road station]]. On July 29, Line 1 phase 2 entered revenue service from [[Dijiao station|Dijiao]] to [[Dongwu Boulevard station|Dongwu Boulevard]]. Despite plans to extend the westernmost terminus to [[Jinshan Avenue]] in [[Dongxihu District]], the station was never built. A short stub with crossover tracks was constructed behind Dongwu Boulevard. [[Zhuyehai]], a station in [[Qiaokou District]], remained non-operational in spite of the existence of complete platforms. Neither exits nor staircases had been built yet. It was due to open when the Wuhan [[IKEA]] store was completed in late 2014.<ref>{{cite web |script-title=zh:\u8f7b\u8f68\u4e8c\u671f\u589e\u8bbe\u7af9\u53f6\u6d77\u7ad9 |url=http://hb.qq.com/a/20090531/000131.htm |language=Chinese}}</ref>\n\nA revised and more detailed construction plan was accepted by the NDRC on January 31, 2011.

Beginning on March 1, Line 1 subdivided its fare zones from 3 to 5 and lowered maximum fare from 5 CNY / ride to 4 CNY / ride.

A feasibility report to Line 6\u2014the second Hankou-Hanyang connection\u2014was also approved by the NDRC on December 21, 2012. Seven days later, line 2 entered revenue service, connecting some of the most populated areas of Hankou, Wuchang, and the [[Optics Valley of China|Optics Valley]].\n\nOn April 12, 2013, the NDRC granted acceptance to a feasibility report of Line 8, phase 1, which connects Hankou and Wuchang via the [[Second Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge|Second Yangtze River Bridge]] corridor.

Following the demolition of old [[Beijing-Hankou Railway]], the city of [[Wuhan]] planned to utilize the corridor to construct the city's first rapid transit rail line. In September 1992, the [[Wuhan Metro Construction Group]] was established by [[Wuhan Municipal Construction Commission]] and a supervision group, led by the mayor [[Qian Yunlu]], was subsequently formed in 1993 to facilitate the project's funding, planning, logistics, and organization. Yet, it was seven years before the city was able to fund construction.\n\nIn October 1999, the [[National Development and Reform Commission|National Planning Commission]] (predecessor of the National Development and Reform Commission) approved the Wuhan \"Light Rail\" project (Line 1, phase 1), signaling the start of serious work on the rail transit project. On October 2, 2000, the [[Wuhan|Wuhan Municipal Government]] ratified the establishment of the [[Wuhan Rail Transit Co., Ltd]]., and contracted construction, operation, administration and related real estate development to the corporation.\n\nIn December 2000, the National Planning Commission accepted a feasibility report on the project and approved construction on phase 1 of Line 1. On December 23, 2000, the project broke ground and comprehensive construction began.\n\nIn 2002, with the anticipation of an economic boom and increasing demand for urban rail transit, Wuhan Municipal Government approved the city's first long-term rail transit master plan. On July 28, 2004, the ten-station long \"light rail\" line was opened to the public and entered revenue service in August. However, low ridership discouraged the city from funding the extension project, for which ground had been broken on December 15, 2005, and a 4-year delay in construction ensued. In April, 2006, the [[National Development and Reform Commission|NDRC]] ratified a six-year construction/operation plan, but it was not until a year later on April 9, 2007 that NDRC accepted the feasibility report for line 1, phase 2 (the extension project) and approved construction on the project.\n\nIn the interim, construction began on the [[Fanhu station]] of the fully underground line 2 on November 16, 2006, as a response to the six-year plan adopted by NDRC earlier. Construction also began on the underground line 4 stations of [[Wuchang railway station]] in June, and [[Wuhan railway station]] in September, as parts of the integral capital project to revamp and construct the [[Wuhan Railway Hub System|Wuhan Railway Hub]].\n\nIn May 2007, the [[Hubei Provincial Development and Reform Commission]] (HDRC) approved preliminary designs on the Line 1, phase 2, and comprehensive construction subsequently commenced in June. On May 15, the city government approved the establishment of [[Wuhan Metro Co., Ltd]]., which would replace the [[Wuhan Rail Transit Co., Ltd]] and assume its responsibilities and benefits.\n\nOn September 12, 2007, the NDRC accepted the feasibility report to Line 2, phase 1, and preliminary designs were approved by the HDRC in December 2007. However, it was not until September 2008 that land purchases and funding were facilitated and comprehensive construction began to take place. In October 2009, drilling of the [[Yangtze River]] tunnel started.\n\nOn March 13, 2009, the NDRC accepted feasibility report to Line 4, phase 1. On May 13, 2009, the HDRC ratified preliminary designs on Line 4, phase 1. Comprehensive construction ensued on the [[Wuchang District|Wuchang]] segment of Line 4. A more ambitious urban rapid transit plan was submitted for NDRC review in October, 2009, and in late November, on-site panel investigations were conducted by [[China International Engineering Consulting Corporation]].\n\nIn February 2010 (Wuhan Metro)'s first commercial property topped out in [[Hanxi 1st Road station]]. On July 29, Line 1 phase 2 entered revenue service from [[Dijiao station|Dijiao]] to [[Dongwu Boulevard station|Dongwu Boulevard]]. Despite plans to extend the westernmost terminus to [[Jinshan Avenue]] in [[Dongxihu District]], the station was never built. A short stub with crossover tracks was constructed behind Dongwu Boulevard. [[Zhuyehai]], a station in [[Qiaokou District]], remained non-operational in spite of the existence of complete platforms. Neither exits nor staircases had been built yet. It was due to open when the Wuhan [[IKEA]] store was completed in late 2014.<ref>{{cite web |script-title=zh:\u8f7b\u8f68\u4e8c\u671f\u589e\u8bbe\u7af9\u53f6\u6d77\u7ad9 |url=http://hb.qq.com/a/20090531/000131.htm |language=Chinese}}</ref>\n\nA revised and more detailed construction plan was accepted by the NDRC on January 31, 2011. The plan specified the city's plan to complete construction on Line 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8 before 2017. Beginning on March 1, Line 1 subdivided its fare zones from 3 to 5 and lowered maximum fare from 5 CNY / ride to 4 CNY / ride.

Maxwell first used the equations to propose that light is an electromagnetic phenomenon.\n\nAn important consequence of Maxwell's equations is that they demonstrate how fluctuating electric and magnetic fields propagate at a constant speed (''[[Speed of light|c]]'') in a vacuum. Known as [[electromagnetic radiation]], these waves may occur at various wavelengths to produce a [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]] of light from [[radio wave]]s to [[gamma ray]]s.\n\nThe equations have two major variants. The microscopic Maxwell equations have universal applicability but are unwieldy for common calculations. They relate the electric and magnetic fields to total charge and total current, including the complicated charges and currents in materials at the [[atomic scale]]. The \"macroscopic\" Maxwell equations define two new auxiliary fields that describe the large-scale behaviour of matter without having to consider atomic scale charges and quantum phenomena like spins. However, their use requires experimentally determined parameters for a phenomenological description of the electromagnetic response of materials.\n\nThe term \"Maxwell's equations\" is often also used for [[#Alternative formulations|equivalent alternative formulations]]. Versions of Maxwell's equations based on the [[electric potential|electric]] and [[magnetic potential]]s are preferred for explicitly solving the equations as a [[boundary value problem]], [[Lorenz force#Lorentz force and analytical mechanics|analytical mechanics]], or for use in [[quantum mechanics]]. The [[Covariant formulation of classical electromagnetism|covariant formulation]] (on [[spacetime]] rather than space and time separately) makes the compatibility of Maxwell's equations with [[special relativity]] [[manifest covariance|manifest]]. [[Maxwell's equations in curved spacetime]], commonly used in [[High energy physics|high energy]] and [[gravitational physics]], are compatible with [[general relativity]].<ref group=\"note\"> In general relativity, however, they must enter, through its [[stress-energy tensor]], into [[Einstein field equations]] that include the spacetime curvature.</ref> In fact, [[Einstein]] developed special and general relativity to accommodate the invariant speed of light, a consequence of  Maxwell's equations, with the principle that only relative movement has physical consequences.\n\nThe publication of the equations marked the [[Unification (physics)|unification]] of previously described phenomena: magnetism, electricity, light and associated radiation.\nSince the mid-20th century, it has been understood that Maxwell's equations are not exact, but a [[classical field theory|classical]] limit of the fundamental theory of [[quantum electrodynamics]].\n\n{{TOC limit|4}}\n\n==Conceptual descriptions==\n\n===Gauss's law===\n\n[[Gauss's law]] describes the relationship between a static [[electric field]] and the [[electric charge]]s that cause it: a static electric field points away from positive charges and towards negative charges, and the net [[electric flux|outflow]] of the electric field through any closed [[Gaussian surface|surface]] is proportional to the charge enclosed by the surface. Picturing the electric field by its field lines, this means the field lines begin at positive electric charges and end at negative electric charges. 'Counting' the number of field lines passing through a [[closed surface]] yields the total charge (including bound charge due to polarization of material) enclosed by that surface, divided by dielectricity of free space (the [[vacuum permittivity]]).\n\n[[Image:VFPt dipole magnetic1.svg|right|thumb|[[Gauss's law for magnetism]]: magnetic field lines never begin nor end but form loops or extend to infinity as shown here with the magnetic field due to a ring of current.]]\n\n===Gauss's law for magnetism===\n\n[[Gauss's law for magnetism]] states that there are no \"magnetic charges\" (also called [[magnetic monopole]]s), analogous to electric charges.<ref name=VideoGlossary>{{cite web | url =http://videoglossary.lbl.gov/#n45 | title =Maxwell's equations | last =Jackson | first =John | website =Science Video Glossary | publisher =Berkeley Lab}}</ref> Instead, the magnetic field due to materials is generated by a configuration called a [[dipole]], and the net outflow of the magnetic field through any closed surface is zero. Magnetic dipoles are best represented as loops of current but resemble positive and negative 'magnetic charges', inseparably bound together, having no net 'magnetic charge'. In terms of field lines, this equation states that magnetic field lines neither begin nor end but make loops or extend to infinity and back. In other words, any magnetic field line that enters a given volume must somewhere exit that volume. Equivalent technical statements are that the sum total [[magnetic flux]] through any Gaussian surface is zero, or that the magnetic field is a [[solenoidal vector field]].\n\n===Faraday's law===\n[[File:Magnetosphere rendition.jpg|thumb|left|In a [[geomagnetic storm]], a surge in the flux of charged particles temporarily alters Earth's magnetic field, which induces electric fields in Earth's atmosphere, thus causing surges in electrical [[power grid]]s. (Not to scale.)]]\nThe [[Faraday's law of induction#Maxwell\u2013Faraday equation|Maxwell\u2013Faraday]] version of [[Faraday's law of induction]] describes how a time varying [[magnetic field]] creates (\"induces\") an [[electric field]].<ref name=VideoGlossary/> In integral form, it states that the work per unit charge required to move a charge around a closed loop equals the rate of change of the magnetic flux through the enclosed surface.\n\nThe dynamically induced electric field has closed field lines similar to a magnetic field, unless superposed by a static (charge induced) electric field. This aspect of [[electromagnetic induction]] is the operating principle behind many [[electric generator]]s: for example, a rotating [[bar magnet]] creates a changing magnetic field, which in turn generates an electric field in a nearby wire.\n\n===Amp\u00e8re's law with Maxwell's addition===\n\n[[Image:Magnetic core.jpg|right|thumb|[[Magnetic core memory]] (1954) is an application of [[Amp\u00e8re's law]]. Each [[Magnetic core|core]] stores one [[bit]] of data.]]\n[[Amp\u00e8re's circuital law|Amp\u00e8re's law with Maxwell's addition]] states that magnetic fields can be generated in two ways: by [[electric current]] (this was the original \"Amp\u00e8re's law\") and by changing electric fields (this was \"Maxwell's addition\", which he called [[displacement current]]). In integral form, the magnetic field induced around any closed loop is proportional to the electric current plus displacement current (proportional to the rate of change of electric flux) through the enclosed surface.\n\nMaxwell's addition to Amp\u00e8re's law is particularly important: it makes the set of equations mathematically consistent for non static fields, without changing the laws of Ampere and Gauss for static fields.<ref>J. D. Jackson, ''Classical Electrodynamics'', section 6.3</ref> However, as a consequence, it predicts that a changing magnetic field induces an electric field and vice versa.<ref name=VideoGlossary/><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=1DZz341Pp50C&pg=PA809 ''Principles of physics: a calculus-based text''], by R. A. Serway, J. W. Jewett, page 809.</ref> Therefore, these equations allow self-sustaining \"[[electromagnetic waves]]\" to travel through empty space (see [[electromagnetic wave equation]]).\n\nThe speed calculated for electromagnetic waves, which could be predicted from experiments on charges and currents,<ref group=\"note\">The quantity we would now call {{math|{{frac|{{sqrt|''\u03b5''{{sub|0}}''\u03bc''{{sub|0}}}}}}}}, with units of velocity, was directly measured before Maxwell's equations, in an 1855 experiment by [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber]] and [[Rudolf Kohlrausch]]. They charged a [[leyden jar]] (a kind of [[capacitor]]), and measured the [[Coulomb's law|electrostatic force]] associated with the potential; then, they discharged it while measuring the [[Amp\u00e8re's force law|magnetic force]] from the current in the discharge wire. Their result was {{val|3.107|e=8|ul=m/s}}, remarkably close to the speed of light. See Joseph F. Keithley, [https://books.google.com/books?id=uwgNAtqSHuQC&pg=PA115 ''The story of electrical and magnetic measurements: from 500 B.C. to the 1940s'', p. 115]</ref> matches the [[speed of light]]; indeed, [[light]] ''is'' one form of [[electromagnetic radiation]] (as are [[X-ray]]s, [[radio wave]]s, and others). Maxwell understood the connection between electromagnetic waves and light in 1861, thereby unifying the theories of [[electromagnetism]] and [[optics]].\n\n==Formulation in terms of electric and magnetic fields (microscopic or in vacuum version)==\n\n<!-- please do not change to Electromagnetic field: we want to (modestly) stress that in this formulation Electric and Magnetic fields play an intertwined but separate role -->\n\nIn the electric and magnetic field formulation there are four equations that determine the fields for given charge and current distribution. A separate [[Physical law|law of nature]], the [[Lorentz force]] law, describes how, conversely, the electric and magnetic fields act on charged particles and currents. A version of this law was included in the original equations by Maxwell but, by convention, is included no longer. The [[vector calculus]] formalism below, the work of [[Oliver Heaviside]],<ref>Bruce J. Hunt (1991) ''[[The Maxwellians]]'', chapter 5 and appendix, [[Cornell University Press]]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Maxwell%27s_Equations |title=IEEEGHN: Maxwell's Equations |publisher=Ieeeghn.org |date= |accessdate=2008-10-19}}</ref> has become standard. It is manifestly rotation invariant, and therefore mathematically much more transparent than Maxwell's original 20 equations in x,y,z components. The [[#Relativistic formulations|relativistic formulations]] are even more symmetric and manifestly Lorentz invariant. For the same equations expressed using tensor calculus or differential forms, see [[#Alternative formulations|alternative formulations]].\n\nThe differential and integral formulations are mathematically equivalent and are both useful. The integral formulation relates fields within a region of space to fields on the boundary and can often be used to simplify and directly calculate fields from symmetric distributions of charges and currents. On the other hand, the differential equations are purely ''local'' and are a more natural starting point for calculating the fields in more complicated (less symmetric) situations, for example using [[finite element analysis]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Partial differential equations and the finite element method |last=\u0160ol\u00edn |first=Pavel |year=2006 |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |isbn=978-0-471-72070-6 |page=273 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-hIG3NZrnd8C&pg=PA273}}</ref>\n\n===Key to the notation===\n<!---please do not make this list much longer \u2013 we used to have a gigantic table of all the constants, variables, terminology, and units, which was converted into prose as it probably should for an encyclopedia (see the history in pre-2013).

Here, {{math|'''F'''}} could be the {{math|'''E'''}} field with source electric charges, but ''not'' the {{math|'''B'''}} field, which has no magnetic charges as shown. The outward [[unit normal]] is '''n'''.]]\n\nAccording to the (purely mathematical) [[divergence theorem|Gauss divergence theorem]], the [[electric flux]] through the \n[[homology (mathematics)|boundary surface]] {{math|\u2202\u03a9}} can be rewritten as\n::{{oiint\n   | intsubscpt=<math>{\\scriptstyle\\partial \\Omega }</math>\n   | integrand=<math>\\mathbf{E}\\cdot\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{S} = \\iiint_{\\Omega} \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E}\\, \\mathrm{d}V</math>\n   }}\nThe integral version of Gauss's equation can thus be rewritten as \n::<math> \\iiint_{\\Omega} \\left(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E} - \\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_0}\\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}V = 0</math>\nSince {{math|\u03a9}} is arbitrary (e.g. an arbitrary small ball with arbitrary center), this is satisfied [[if and only if]] the integrand is zero everywhere. This is \nthe differential equations formulation of Gauss equation up to a trivial rearrangement.\n\nSimilarly rewriting the [[magnetic flux]] in Gauss's law for magnetism in integral form gives  \n::{{oiint\n   | intsubscpt=<math>{\\scriptstyle\\partial \\Omega }</math>\n   | integrand=<math>\\mathbf{B}\\cdot\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{S} = \\iiint_{\\Omega} \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B}\\, \\mathrm{d}V = 0</math>\n   }}.\nwhich is satisfied for all {{math|\u03a9}} if and only if <math> \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0</math> everywhere.\n\n===Circulation and curl===\n\n[[File:Curl theorem in EM.svg|thumb|Surface {{math|\u03a3}} with closed boundary {{math|\u2202\u03a3}}. {{math|'''F'''}} could be the {{math|'''E'''}} or {{math|'''B'''}} fields.

The left-hand side of the modified Ampere's Law has zero divergence by the [[vector calculus identities#divergence of the curl|div\u2013curl identity]].

The [[magnetic field#Magnetic dipoles|connection to angular momentum]] suggests the picture of an assembly of microscopic current loops. Outside the material, an assembly of such microscopic current loops is not different from a macroscopic current circulating around the material's surface, despite the fact that no individual charge is traveling a large distance. These ''[[Bound current#Magnetization current|bound currents]]'' can be described using the [[magnetization]] {{math|'''M'''}}.<ref>See {{cite book|author=David J.

As such, ''Maxwell's macroscopic equations'' ignore many details on a fine scale that can be unimportant to understanding matters on a gross scale by calculating fields that are averaged over some suitable volume.\n\n===Auxiliary fields, polarization and magnetization===\nThe ''[[List of electromagnetism equations#Definitions|definitions]]'' (not constitutive relations) of the auxiliary fields are:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\mathbf{D}(\\mathbf{r}, t) &= \\varepsilon_0 \\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r}, t) + \\mathbf{P}(\\mathbf{r}, t) \\\\\n  \\mathbf{H}(\\mathbf{r}, t) &= \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} \\mathbf{B}(\\mathbf{r}, t) - \\mathbf{M}(\\mathbf{r}, t)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|'''P'''}} is the [[polarization density|polarization]] field and {{math|'''M'''}} is the [[magnetization]] field, which are defined in terms of microscopic bound charges and bound currents respectively.

Equivalently, we have to specify the dependence of the polarization {{math|'''P'''}} (hence the bound charge) and the magnetization {{math|'''M'''}} (hence the bound current) on the applied electric and magnetic field. The equations specifying this response are called [[constitutive relation]]s. For real-world materials, the constitutive relations are rarely simple, except approximately, and usually determined by experiment.

Each formulation has versions directly in terms of the electric and magnetic fields, and indirectly in terms of the [[electrical potential]] {{math|''\u03c6''}} and the [[vector potential]] {{math|'''A'''}}. Potentials were introduced as a convenient way to solve the homogeneous equations, but it was thought that all observable physics was contained in the electric and magnetic fields (or relativistically, the Faraday tensor). The potentials play a central role in quantum mechanics, however, and act quantum mechanically with observable consequences even when the electric and magnetic fields vanish ([[Aharonov\u2013Bohm effect]]).\n\nEach table describes one formalism.

The direct spacetime formulations make manifest that the Maxwell equations are [[relativistically invariant]]. Because of this symmetry electric and magnetic field are treated on equal footing and are recognised as components of the [[Faraday tensor]]. This reduces the four Maxwell equations to two, which simplifies the equations, although we can no longer use the familiar vector formulation. In fact the Maxwell equations in the space + time formulation are not [[Galilean transformation|Galileo invariant]] and have Lorentz invariance as a hidden symmetry. This was a major source of inspiration for the development of relativity theory. Indeed,  even the formulation that treats space and time separately is not a non-relativistic approximation and describes the same physics by simply renaming variables.

This is violated for Minkowski space with a line removed, which can model a (flat) spacetime with a point-like monopole on the complement of the line.\n*In the [[differential form]] formulation on arbitrary space times, {{math|1=''F'' = ''F''{{sub|''\u03b1\u03b2''}}d''x''{{sup|''\u03b1''}} \u2227 d''x''{{sup|''\u03b2''}}}} is the electromagnetic tensor considered as a 2-form, {{math|1=''A'' = ''A''{{sub|''\u03b1''}}d''x''{{sup|''\u03b1''}}}} is the potential 1-form, {{math|''J''}} is the current 3-form, {{math|d}} is the [[exterior derivative]], and <math>{\\star}</math> is the [[Hodge star]] on forms defined (up to its orientation, i.e. its sign) by the Lorentzian metric of spacetime. In the special case of 2-forms such as ''F'', the Hodge star <math>{\\star}</math> depends on the metric tensor only for its local scale<!--On signature (1,3) or (3,1) and two forms: \u03b4 = \u2212*d* so (d*d \u2212 *d*d*) = *(\u2212*d* d + d \u2212*d*) = *Hodge Laplacian -->. This means that, as formulated, the differential form field equations are [[conformal geometry|conformally invariant]], but the Lorenz gauge condition breaks conformal invariance. The operator <math>\\Box = (-{\\star} \\mathrm{d} {\\star} \\mathrm{d} - \\mathrm{d} {\\star} \\mathrm{d} {\\star}) </math> is the [[Laplace\u2013Beltrami operator|d'Alembert\u2013Laplace\u2013Beltrami operator]] on 1-forms on an arbitrary [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold#Lorentzian manifold|Lorentzian spacetime]]. The topological condition is again that the second real cohomology group is 'trivial' (meaning that its form follows from a definition). By the isomorphism with the second [[de Rham cohomology]] this condition means that every closed 2-form is exact.\n\nOther formalisms include the [[Geometric algebra#Spacetime Model|geometric algebra formulation]] and a [[matrix representation of Maxwell's equations]].

(The currents and charges are not unknowns, being freely specifiable subject to [[charge conservation]].) This is related to a certain limited kind of redundancy in Maxwell's equations: It can be proven that any system satisfying Faraday's law and Ampere's law ''automatically'' also satisfies the two Gauss's laws, as long as the system's initial condition does, and assuming conservation of charge and the nonexistence of magnetic monopoles.<ref>{{cite book|author=H Freist\u00fchler & G Warnecke |title=Hyperbolic Problems: Theory, Numerics, Applications |year=2001 |page=605 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XXX_mG0vneMC&pg=PA605#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=9783764367107 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Redundancy and superfluity for electromagnetic fields and potentials |journal=American Journal of Physics |author=J Rosen |volume=48 |issue=12 |page=1071 |doi=10.1119/1.12289|bibcode = 1980AmJPh..48.1071R |year=1980 }}</ref> \nThis explanation was first introduced by [[Julius Adams Stratton]] in 1941.<ref>{{cite book|author=J.

By introducing dummy variables characterizing these violations, the four equations become not overdetermined after all. The resulting formulation can lead to more accurate algorithms that take all four laws into account.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Origin of Spurious Solutions in Computational Electromagnetics |author=B Jiang & J Wu & L.

The equations can be linearly dependent. But in differential equations, and especially PDEs, one needs appropriate boundary conditions, which depend in not so obvious ways on the equations. Even more, if one rewrites them in terms of vector and scalar potential, then the equations are underdetermined because of [[Gauge fixing]].\n\n==Maxwell's equations as the classical limit of QED==\n\nMaxwell's equations and the Lorentz force law (along with the rest of classical electromagnetism) are extraordinarily successful at explaining and predicting a variety of phenomena; however they are not exact, but a [[classical field theory|classical]] limit of [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED).\n\nSome observed electromagnetic phenomena are incompatible with Maxwell's equations. These include  [[photon\u2013photon scattering]] and many other phenomena related to [[photon]]s or [[virtual particle|virtual photons]], \"[[nonclassical light]]\" and [[quantum entanglement]] of electromagnetic fields (see [[quantum optics]]). E.g. [[quantum cryptography]] cannot be described by Maxwell theory, not even approximately. The approximate nature of Maxwell's equations becomes more and more apparent when going into the extremely strong field regime (see [[Euler\u2013Heisenberg Lagrangian]]) or to extremely small distances.\n\nFinally, Maxwell's equations cannot explain any phenomenon involving individual [[photon]]s interacting with quantum matter, such as the [[photoelectric effect]], [[Planck's law]], the [[Duane\u2013Hunt law]], and [[Single-photon avalanche diode|single-photon light detectors]]. However, many such phenomena may be approximated using a halfway theory of quantum matter coupled to a classical electromagnetic field, either as external field or with the expected value of the charge current and density on the right hand side of Maxwell's equations.\n\n==Variations==\n\nPopular variations on the Maxwell equations as a classical theory of electromagnetic fields are relatively scarce because the standard equations have stood the test of time remarkably well.\n\n===Magnetic monopoles===\n{{main|Magnetic monopole}}\n\nMaxwell's equations posit that there is [[electric charge]], but no [[magnetic charge]] (also called [[magnetic monopole]]s), in the universe. Indeed, magnetic charge has never been observed, despite extensive searches,<ref group=\"note\">See [[magnetic monopole]] for a discussion of monopole searches. Recently, scientists have discovered that some types of condensed matter, including [[spin ice]] and [[topological insulator]]s, which display ''emergent'' behavior resembling magnetic monopoles. (See [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1178868 sciencemag.org] and [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v461/n7266/full/nature08500.html nature.com].) Although these were described in the popular press as the long-awaited discovery of magnetic monopoles, they are only superficially related. A \"true\" magnetic monopole is something where {{math|\u2207 \u22c5 '''B''' \u2260 0}}, whereas in these condensed-matter systems, {{math|1=\u2207 \u22c5 '''B''' = 0}} while only {{math|\u2207 \u22c5 '''H''' \u2260 0}}.</ref> and may not exist.

Maxwell first used the equations to propose that light is an electromagnetic phenomenon.\n\nAn important consequence of Maxwell's equations is that they demonstrate how fluctuating electric and magnetic fields propagate at a constant speed (''[[Speed of light|c]]'') in a vacuum. Known as [[electromagnetic radiation]], these waves may occur at various wavelengths to produce a [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]] of light from [[radio wave]]s to [[gamma ray]]s.\n\nThe equations have two major variants. The microscopic Maxwell equations have universal applicability but are unwieldy for common calculations. They relate the electric and magnetic fields to total charge and total current, including the complicated charges and currents in materials at the [[atomic scale]]. The \"macroscopic\" Maxwell equations define two new auxiliary fields that describe the large-scale behaviour of matter without having to consider atomic scale charges and quantum phenomena like spins. However, their use requires experimentally determined parameters for a phenomenological description of the electromagnetic response of materials.\n\nThe term \"Maxwell's equations\" is often also used for [[#Alternative formulations|equivalent alternative formulations]]. Versions of Maxwell's equations based on the [[electric potential|electric]] and [[magnetic potential]]s are preferred for explicitly solving the equations as a [[boundary value problem]], [[Lorenz force#Lorentz force and analytical mechanics|analytical mechanics]], or for use in [[quantum mechanics]]. The [[Covariant formulation of classical electromagnetism|covariant formulation]] (on [[spacetime]] rather than space and time separately) makes the compatibility of Maxwell's equations with [[special relativity]] [[manifest covariance|manifest]]. [[Maxwell's equations in curved spacetime]], commonly used in [[High energy physics|high energy]] and [[gravitational physics]], are compatible with [[general relativity]].<ref group=\"note\"> In general relativity, however, they must enter, through its [[stress-energy tensor]], into [[Einstein field equations]] that include the spacetime curvature.</ref> In fact, [[Einstein]] developed special and general relativity to accommodate the invariant speed of light, a consequence of  Maxwell's equations, with the principle that only relative movement has physical consequences.\n\nThe publication of the equations marked the [[Unification (physics)|unification]] of previously described phenomena: magnetism, electricity, light and associated radiation.\nSince the mid-20th century, it has been understood that Maxwell's equations are not exact, but a [[classical field theory|classical]] limit of the fundamental theory of [[quantum electrodynamics]].\n\n{{TOC limit|4}}\n\n==Conceptual descriptions==\n\n===Gauss's law===\n\n[[Gauss's law]] describes the relationship between a static [[electric field]] and the [[electric charge]]s that cause it: a static electric field points away from positive charges and towards negative charges, and the net [[electric flux|outflow]] of the electric field through any closed [[Gaussian surface|surface]] is proportional to the charge enclosed by the surface. Picturing the electric field by its field lines, this means the field lines begin at positive electric charges and end at negative electric charges. 'Counting' the number of field lines passing through a [[closed surface]] yields the total charge (including bound charge due to polarization of material) enclosed by that surface, divided by dielectricity of free space (the [[vacuum permittivity]]).\n\n[[Image:VFPt dipole magnetic1.svg|right|thumb|[[Gauss's law for magnetism]]: magnetic field lines never begin nor end but form loops or extend to infinity as shown here with the magnetic field due to a ring of current.]]\n\n===Gauss's law for magnetism===\n\n[[Gauss's law for magnetism]] states that there are no \"magnetic charges\" (also called [[magnetic monopole]]s), analogous to electric charges.<ref name=VideoGlossary>{{cite web | url =http://videoglossary.lbl.gov/#n45 | title =Maxwell's equations | last =Jackson | first =John | website =Science Video Glossary | publisher =Berkeley Lab}}</ref> Instead, the magnetic field due to materials is generated by a configuration called a [[dipole]], and the net outflow of the magnetic field through any closed surface is zero. Magnetic dipoles are best represented as loops of current but resemble positive and negative 'magnetic charges', inseparably bound together, having no net 'magnetic charge'. In terms of field lines, this equation states that magnetic field lines neither begin nor end but make loops or extend to infinity and back. In other words, any magnetic field line that enters a given volume must somewhere exit that volume. Equivalent technical statements are that the sum total [[magnetic flux]] through any Gaussian surface is zero, or that the magnetic field is a [[solenoidal vector field]].\n\n===Faraday's law===\n[[File:Magnetosphere rendition.jpg|thumb|left|In a [[geomagnetic storm]], a surge in the flux of charged particles temporarily alters Earth's magnetic field, which induces electric fields in Earth's atmosphere, thus causing surges in electrical [[power grid]]s. (Not to scale.)]]\nThe [[Faraday's law of induction#Maxwell\u2013Faraday equation|Maxwell\u2013Faraday]] version of [[Faraday's law of induction]] describes how a time varying [[magnetic field]] creates (\"induces\") an [[electric field]].<ref name=VideoGlossary/> In integral form, it states that the work per unit charge required to move a charge around a closed loop equals the rate of change of the magnetic flux through the enclosed surface.\n\nThe dynamically induced electric field has closed field lines similar to a magnetic field, unless superposed by a static (charge induced) electric field. This aspect of [[electromagnetic induction]] is the operating principle behind many [[electric generator]]s: for example, a rotating [[bar magnet]] creates a changing magnetic field, which in turn generates an electric field in a nearby wire.\n\n===Amp\u00e8re's law with Maxwell's addition===\n\n[[Image:Magnetic core.jpg|right|thumb|[[Magnetic core memory]] (1954) is an application of [[Amp\u00e8re's law]]. Each [[Magnetic core|core]] stores one [[bit]] of data.]]\n[[Amp\u00e8re's circuital law|Amp\u00e8re's law with Maxwell's addition]] states that magnetic fields can be generated in two ways: by [[electric current]] (this was the original \"Amp\u00e8re's law\") and by changing electric fields (this was \"Maxwell's addition\", which he called [[displacement current]]). In integral form, the magnetic field induced around any closed loop is proportional to the electric current plus displacement current (proportional to the rate of change of electric flux) through the enclosed surface.\n\nMaxwell's addition to Amp\u00e8re's law is particularly important: it makes the set of equations mathematically consistent for non static fields, without changing the laws of Ampere and Gauss for static fields.<ref>J. D. Jackson, ''Classical Electrodynamics'', section 6.3</ref> However, as a consequence, it predicts that a changing magnetic field induces an electric field and vice versa.<ref name=VideoGlossary/><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=1DZz341Pp50C&pg=PA809 ''Principles of physics: a calculus-based text''], by R.

They charged a [[leyden jar]] (a kind of [[capacitor]]), and measured the [[Coulomb's law|electrostatic force]] associated with the potential; then, they discharged it while measuring the [[Amp\u00e8re's force law|magnetic force]] from the current in the discharge wire. Their result was {{val|3.107|e=8|ul=m/s}}, remarkably close to the speed of light. See Joseph F. Keithley, [https://books.google.com/books?id=uwgNAtqSHuQC&pg=PA115 ''The story of electrical and magnetic measurements: from 500 B.C. to the 1940s'', p. 115]</ref> matches the [[speed of light]]; indeed, [[light]] ''is'' one form of [[electromagnetic radiation]] (as are [[X-ray]]s, [[radio wave]]s, and others). Maxwell understood the connection between electromagnetic waves and light in 1861, thereby unifying the theories of [[electromagnetism]] and [[optics]].\n\n==Formulation in terms of electric and magnetic fields (microscopic or in vacuum version)==\n\n<!-- please do not change to Electromagnetic field: we want to (modestly) stress that in this formulation Electric and Magnetic fields play an intertwined but separate role -->\n\nIn the electric and magnetic field formulation there are four equations that determine the fields for given charge and current distribution. A separate [[Physical law|law of nature]], the [[Lorentz force]] law, describes how, conversely, the electric and magnetic fields act on charged particles and currents. A version of this law was included in the original equations by Maxwell but, by convention, is included no longer.

It is manifestly rotation invariant, and therefore mathematically much more transparent than Maxwell's original 20 equations in x,y,z components. The [[#Relativistic formulations|relativistic formulations]] are even more symmetric and manifestly Lorentz invariant. For the same equations expressed using tensor calculus or differential forms, see [[#Alternative formulations|alternative formulations]].\n\nThe differential and integral formulations are mathematically equivalent and are both useful. The integral formulation relates fields within a region of space to fields on the boundary and can often be used to simplify and directly calculate fields from symmetric distributions of charges and currents. On the other hand, the differential equations are purely ''local'' and are a more natural starting point for calculating the fields in more complicated (less symmetric) situations, for example using [[finite element analysis]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Partial differential equations and the finite element method |last=\u0160ol\u00edn |first=Pavel |year=2006 |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |isbn=978-0-471-72070-6 |page=273 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-hIG3NZrnd8C&pg=PA273}}</ref>\n\n===Key to the notation===\n<!---please do not make this list much longer \u2013 we used to have a gigantic table of all the constants, variables, terminology, and units, which was converted into prose as it probably should for an encyclopedia (see the history in pre-2013).

This produces a ''macroscopic'' ''bound charge'' in the material even though all of the charges involved are bound to individual molecules. For example, if every molecule responds the same, similar to that shown in the figure, these tiny movements of charge combine to produce a layer of positive [[Bound charge#Bound charge|bound charge]] on one side of the material and a layer of negative charge on the other side. The bound charge is most conveniently described in terms of the [[polarization density|polarization]] {{math|'''P'''}} of the material, its dipole moment per unit volume. If {{math|'''P'''}} is uniform, a macroscopic separation of charge is produced only at the surfaces where {{math|'''P'''}} enters and leaves the material. For non-uniform {{math|'''P'''}}, a charge is also produced in the bulk.<ref>See {{cite book|author=David J.

The [[magnetic field#Magnetic dipoles|connection to angular momentum]] suggests the picture of an assembly of microscopic current loops. Outside the material, an assembly of such microscopic current loops is not different from a macroscopic current circulating around the material's surface, despite the fact that no individual charge is traveling a large distance. These ''[[Bound current#Magnetization current|bound currents]]'' can be described using the [[magnetization]] {{math|'''M'''}}.<ref>See {{cite book|author=David J.

As such, ''Maxwell's macroscopic equations'' ignore many details on a fine scale that can be unimportant to understanding matters on a gross scale by calculating fields that are averaged over some suitable volume.\n\n===Auxiliary fields, polarization and magnetization===\nThe ''[[List of electromagnetism equations#Definitions|definitions]]'' (not constitutive relations) of the auxiliary fields are:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\mathbf{D}(\\mathbf{r}, t) &= \\varepsilon_0 \\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r}, t) + \\mathbf{P}(\\mathbf{r}, t) \\\\\n  \\mathbf{H}(\\mathbf{r}, t) &= \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} \\mathbf{B}(\\mathbf{r}, t) - \\mathbf{M}(\\mathbf{r}, t)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|'''P'''}} is the [[polarization density|polarization]] field and {{math|'''M'''}} is the [[magnetization]] field, which are defined in terms of microscopic bound charges and bound currents respectively.

Equivalently, we have to specify the dependence of the polarization {{math|'''P'''}} (hence the bound charge) and the magnetization {{math|'''M'''}} (hence the bound current) on the applied electric and magnetic field. The equations specifying this response are called [[constitutive relation]]s. For real-world materials, the constitutive relations are rarely simple, except approximately, and usually determined by experiment.

Potentials were introduced as a convenient way to solve the homogeneous equations, but it was thought that all observable physics was contained in the electric and magnetic fields (or relativistically, the Faraday tensor).

The direct spacetime formulations make manifest that the Maxwell equations are [[relativistically invariant]]. Because of this symmetry electric and magnetic field are treated on equal footing and are recognised as components of the [[Faraday tensor]]. This reduces the four Maxwell equations to two, which simplifies the equations, although we can no longer use the familiar vector formulation. In fact the Maxwell equations in the space + time formulation are not [[Galilean transformation|Galileo invariant]] and have Lorentz invariance as a hidden symmetry. This was a major source of inspiration for the development of relativity theory. Indeed,  even the formulation that treats space and time separately is not a non-relativistic approximation and describes the same physics by simply renaming variables. For this reason the relativistic invariant equations are usually called the Maxwell equations as well.\n\nEach table describes one formalism.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ [[Tensor calculus]]\n! scope=\"column\" | Formulation\n! scope=\"column\" | Homogeneous equations\n! scope=\"column\" | Inhomogeneous equations\n|-\n!

In Minkowski space coordinates are chosen with respect to an [[inertial frame]]; {{math|1=(''x''{{sup|''\u03b1''}}) = (''ct'',''x'',''y'',''z'')}}, so that the [[metric tensor]] used to raise and lower indices is {{math|1=''\u03b7''{{sub|''\u03b1\u03b2''}} = diag(1,\u22121,\u22121,\u22121)}}. The d'Alembert operator on Minkowski space is {{math|1=\u25fb = \u2202{{sub|''\u03b1''}}\u2202{{sup|''\u03b1''}}}} as in the vector formulation. In general spacetimes, the coordinate system {{math|''x''{{sup|''\u03b1''}}}} is arbitrary, the [[covariant derivative]] {{math|\u2207{{sub|''\u03b1''}}}}, the Ricci tensor, {{math|''R''{{sub|''\u03b1\u03b2''}}}} and raising and lowering of indices are defined by the Lorentzian metric, {{math|''g''{{sub|''\u03b1\u03b2''}}}} and the d'Alembert operator is defined as {{math|1=\u25fb = \u2207{{sub|''\u03b1''}}\u2207{{sup|''\u03b1''}}}}. The topological restriction is that the second real [[cohomology]] group of the space vanishes (see the differential form formulation for an explanation). This is violated for Minkowski space with a line removed, which can model a (flat) spacetime with a point-like monopole on the complement of the line.\n*In the [[differential form]] formulation on arbitrary space times, {{math|1=''F'' = ''F''{{sub|''\u03b1\u03b2''}}d''x''{{sup|''\u03b1''}} \u2227 d''x''{{sup|''\u03b2''}}}} is the electromagnetic tensor considered as a 2-form, {{math|1=''A'' = ''A''{{sub|''\u03b1''}}d''x''{{sup|''\u03b1''}}}} is the potential 1-form, {{math|''J''}} is the current 3-form, {{math|d}} is the [[exterior derivative]], and <math>{\\star}</math> is the [[Hodge star]] on forms defined (up to its orientation, i.e. its sign) by the Lorentzian metric of spacetime. In the special case of 2-forms such as ''F'', the Hodge star <math>{\\star}</math> depends on the metric tensor only for its local scale<!--On signature (1,3) or (3,1) and two forms: \u03b4 = \u2212*d* so (d*d \u2212 *d*d*) = *(\u2212*d* d + d \u2212*d*) = *Hodge Laplacian -->. This means that, as formulated, the differential form field equations are [[conformal geometry|conformally invariant]], but the Lorenz gauge condition breaks conformal invariance. The operator <math>\\Box = (-{\\star} \\mathrm{d} {\\star} \\mathrm{d} - \\mathrm{d} {\\star} \\mathrm{d} {\\star}) </math> is the [[Laplace\u2013Beltrami operator|d'Alembert\u2013Laplace\u2013Beltrami operator]] on 1-forms on an arbitrary [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold#Lorentzian manifold|Lorentzian spacetime]]. The topological condition is again that the second real cohomology group is 'trivial' (meaning that its form follows from a definition). By the isomorphism with the second [[de Rham cohomology]] this condition means that every closed 2-form is exact.\n\nOther formalisms include the [[Geometric algebra#Spacetime Model|geometric algebra formulation]] and a [[matrix representation of Maxwell's equations]].

(The currents and charges are not unknowns, being freely specifiable subject to [[charge conservation]].) This is related to a certain limited kind of redundancy in Maxwell's equations: It can be proven that any system satisfying Faraday's law and Ampere's law ''automatically'' also satisfies the two Gauss's laws, as long as the system's initial condition does, and assuming conservation of charge and the nonexistence of magnetic monopoles.<ref>{{cite book|author=H Freist\u00fchler & G Warnecke |title=Hyperbolic Problems: Theory, Numerics, Applications |year=2001 |page=605 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XXX_mG0vneMC&pg=PA605#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=9783764367107 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Redundancy and superfluity for electromagnetic fields and potentials |journal=American Journal of Physics |author=J Rosen |volume=48 |issue=12 |page=1071 |doi=10.1119/1.12289|bibcode = 1980AmJPh..48.1071R |year=1980 }}</ref> \nThis explanation was first introduced by [[Julius Adams Stratton]] in 1941.<ref>{{cite book|author=J.

By introducing dummy variables characterizing these violations, the four equations become not overdetermined after all. The resulting formulation can lead to more accurate algorithms that take all four laws into account.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Origin of Spurious Solutions in Computational Electromagnetics |author=B Jiang & J Wu & L.

The equations can be linearly dependent. But in differential equations, and especially PDEs, one needs appropriate boundary conditions, which depend in not so obvious ways on the equations. Even more, if one rewrites them in terms of vector and scalar potential, then the equations are underdetermined because of [[Gauge fixing]].\n\n==Maxwell's equations as the classical limit of QED==\n\nMaxwell's equations and the Lorentz force law (along with the rest of classical electromagnetism) are extraordinarily successful at explaining and predicting a variety of phenomena; however they are not exact, but a [[classical field theory|classical]] limit of [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED).\n\nSome observed electromagnetic phenomena are incompatible with Maxwell's equations. These include  [[photon\u2013photon scattering]] and many other phenomena related to [[photon]]s or [[virtual particle|virtual photons]], \"[[nonclassical light]]\" and [[quantum entanglement]] of electromagnetic fields (see [[quantum optics]]). E.g. [[quantum cryptography]] cannot be described by Maxwell theory, not even approximately. The approximate nature of Maxwell's equations becomes more and more apparent when going into the extremely strong field regime (see [[Euler\u2013Heisenberg Lagrangian]]) or to extremely small distances.\n\nFinally, Maxwell's equations cannot explain any phenomenon involving individual [[photon]]s interacting with quantum matter, such as the [[photoelectric effect]], [[Planck's law]], the [[Duane\u2013Hunt law]], and [[Single-photon avalanche diode|single-photon light detectors]]. However, many such phenomena may be approximated using a halfway theory of quantum matter coupled to a classical electromagnetic field, either as external field or with the expected value of the charge current and density on the right hand side of Maxwell's equations.\n\n==Variations==\n\nPopular variations on the Maxwell equations as a classical theory of electromagnetic fields are relatively scarce because the standard equations have stood the test of time remarkably well.\n\n===Magnetic monopoles===\n{{main|Magnetic monopole}}\n\nMaxwell's equations posit that there is [[electric charge]], but no [[magnetic charge]] (also called [[magnetic monopole]]s), in the universe. Indeed, magnetic charge has never been observed, despite extensive searches,<ref group=\"note\">See [[magnetic monopole]] for a discussion of monopole searches. Recently, scientists have discovered that some types of condensed matter, including [[spin ice]] and [[topological insulator]]s, which display ''emergent'' behavior resembling magnetic monopoles. (See [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1178868 sciencemag.org] and [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v461/n7266/full/nature08500.html nature.com].) Although these were described in the popular press as the long-awaited discovery of magnetic monopoles, they are only superficially related. A \"true\" magnetic monopole is something where {{math|\u2207 \u22c5 '''B''' \u2260 0}}, whereas in these condensed-matter systems, {{math|1=\u2207 \u22c5 '''B''' = 0}} while only {{math|\u2207 \u22c5 '''H''' \u2260 0}}.</ref> and may not exist. If they did exist, both Gauss's law for magnetism and Faraday's law would need to be modified, and the resulting four equations would be fully symmetric under the interchange of electric and magnetic fields.<ref name=Jackson/>{{rp|273\u2013275}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Electronics|Physics}} \n{{Wikipedia books|Maxwell's equations}}\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Algebra of physical space]]\n* [[Fresnel equations]]\n* [[Gravitoelectromagnetism]]\n* [[Interface conditions for electromagnetic fields]]\n* [[Moving magnet and conductor problem]]\n* [[Riemann\u2013Silberstein vector]]\n* [[Spacetime algebra]]\n* [[Wheeler\u2013Feynman absorber theory]]\n}}\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{Reflist|group=\"note\"|1}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n:''Further reading can be found in [[list of textbooks in electromagnetism]]''\n\n==Historical publications==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081217035457/http://blazelabs.com/On%20Faraday%27s%20Lines%20of%20Force.pdf On Faraday's Lines of Force&nbsp;\u2013 1855/56] Maxwell's first paper (Part 1 & 2)&nbsp;\u2013 Compiled by Blaze Labs Research (PDF)\n* [//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/On_Physical_Lines_of_Force.pdf On Physical Lines of Force&nbsp;\u2013 1861] Maxwell's 1861 paper describing magnetic lines of Force&nbsp;\u2013 Predecessor to 1873 Treatise\n* [[James Clerk Maxwell]], \"[[A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field]]\", ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London'' '''155''', 459\u2013512 (1865).

Solving this equation gives the position and the momentum of the physical system as a function of the external force <math>\\mathbf{F}</math> on the system. Those two parameters are sufficient to describe its state at each time instant. In quantum mechanics, the analogue of Newton's law is Schr\u00f6dinger's equation.\n\nThe concept of a wave function is a fundamental [[Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics|postulate of quantum mechanics]]; the wave function defines the state of the system at each spatial position, and time. Using these postulates, Schr\u00f6dinger's equation can be derived from the fact that the time-evolution operator must be [[Unitary operator|unitary]], and must therefore be generated by the exponential of a [[self-adjoint operator]], which is the quantum Hamiltonian.

The general equation is indeed quite general, used throughout quantum mechanics, for everything from the [[Dirac equation]] to [[quantum field theory]], by plugging in diverse expressions for the Hamiltonian. The specific nonrelativistic version is a strictly classical approximation to reality and yields accurate results in many situations, but only to a certain extent (see [[relativistic quantum mechanics]] and [[relativistic quantum field theory]]).\n\nTo apply the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, write down the Hamiltonian for the system, accounting for the kinetic and potential energies of the particles constituting the system, then insert it into the Schr\u00f6dinger equation.

This is only used when the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] itself is not dependent on time explicitly. However, even in this case the total wave function still has a time dependency.\n\nIn the language of [[linear algebra]], this equation is an [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalue equation]]. Therefore, the wave function is an [[eigenfunction]] of the Hamiltonian operator with corresponding eigenvalue(s) <math>E</math>.\n\nAs before, the most common manifestation is the [[relativistic quantum mechanics|nonrelativistic]] Schr\u00f6dinger equation for a single particle moving in an electric field (but not a magnetic field):\n\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent=:\n|title='''Time-independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation''' (''single nonrelativistic particle'')\n|equation=<math>\\left[ \\frac{-\\hbar^2}{2m}\\nabla^2 + V(\\mathbf{r}) \\right] \\Psi(\\mathbf{r}) = E \\Psi(\\mathbf{r})</math>\n|cellpadding\n|border\n|border colour = rgb(0,115,207)\n|background colour = rgb(0,115,207,10%)}}\n\nwith definitions as above.

That is, <math>H = T + V = \\frac{\\|\\mathbf{p}\\|^2}{2m} + V(x, y, z)</math> for a single particle in the non-relativistic limit.\n\nThe time-independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation is discussed further below.\n\n==Derivation==\nOne may derive the Schr\u00f6dinger equation starting from the [[Dirac-von Neumann axioms]]. Suppose the [[wave function]] <math>\\psi(t_0)</math> represents a unit vector defined on a complex [[Hilbert space]] at some initial time <math>t_0</math>. The [[Unitarity (physics)|unitarity principle]] requires that there must exist a linear operator, <math>\\hat{U}(t)</math>, such that for any time <math>t > t_0</math>,\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\psi(t) = \\hat{U}(t)\\psi(t_0).</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\nGiven that <math>\\psi(t)</math> must remain a unit vector, the operator <math>\\hat{U}(t)</math> must therefore be a [[Unitary transformation (quantum mechanics)|unitary transformation]]. As such, there exists an [[Exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential map]] such that <math>\\hat{U}(t) = e^{-i\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}t}</math> where <math>\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}</math> is a [[Hermitian operator]] (given by the fact that the [[Lie algebra]] of the [[unitary group]] is generated by skew-[[Hermitian operators]], and if <math>\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}</math> is Hermitian, then <math>-i \\hat{\\mathcal{H}}</math> is skew-Hermitian). Therefore, the first-order Taylor expansion of <math>\\hat{U}(t)</math> centered at <math>t_0</math> takes the form\n:<math>\\hat{U}(t) \\approx 1 - i(t-t_0)\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}.</math>\n\nAnd so, substituting the above expansion into ({{EquationNote|1}}) thus yields\n:<math>\\psi(t) = \\psi(t_0) - i(t-t_0)\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}\\psi(t_0),</math>\n\nwhich, when rearranged and taken in the limit <math>t \\rightarrow t_0</math>, provides an equation of the same form as the Schr&ouml;dinger equation\n:<math>i\\frac{d\\psi}{dt} = \\hat{\\mathcal{H}}\\psi,</math>\n\nwhere the ordinary definition for the derivative was used. However, the operator <math>\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}</math> used here denotes an ''arbitrary'' Hermitian operator. Nonetheless, by using the [[correspondence principle]] it is possible to show that in the classical limit, using appropriate units, the expectation value of <math>\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}</math> indeed corresponds to the Hamiltonian of the system.<ref>{{cite book|title=Modern Quantum Mechanics|last1=Sakurai|first1=J. J.|date=1995|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Reading, Massachusetts|page=68}}</ref>\n\n==Implications==\n===Energy===\nThe Hamiltonian is constructed in the same manner as in classical mechanics. However, in classical mechanics, the Hamiltonian is a scalar-valued function, whereas in quantum mechanics, it is an operator on a space of functions. It is not surprising that the [[eigenvalues]] of <math>\\hat{H}</math> are the energy levels of the system.\n\n===Quantization===\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation predicts that if certain properties of a system are measured, the result may be ''quantized'', meaning that only specific discrete values can occur. One example is ''energy quantization'': the energy of an electron in an atom is always one of the [[Energy level|quantized energy levels]], a fact discovered via [[atomic spectroscopy]]. (Energy quantization is discussed [[#Time-independent|below]].) Another example is [[angular momentum operator|quantization of angular momentum]]. This was an ''assumption'' in the earlier [[Bohr model|Bohr model of the atom]], but it is a ''prediction'' of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\n\nAnother result of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is that not every measurement gives a quantized result in quantum mechanics. For example, position, momentum, time, and (in some situations) energy can have any value across a continuous range.<ref name=\"Zettili2009\">{{cite book|author=Nouredine Zettili|title=Quantum Mechanics: Concepts and Applications|date=17 February 2009|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-470-02678-6}}</ref>{{rp|165\u2013167}}\n\n===Quantum tunneling===\n{{main|Quantum tunneling}}\n[[File:TunnelEffektKling1.png|width = 300px|thumb|[[Quantum tunneling]] through a barrier. A particle coming from the left does not have enough energy to climb the barrier. However, it can sometimes \"tunnel\" to the other side. ]]\n\nIn classical physics, when a ball is rolled slowly up a large hill, it will come to a stop and roll back, because it doesn't have enough energy to get over the top of the hill to the other side. However, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation predicts that there is a small probability that the ball will get to the other side of the hill, even if it has too little energy to reach the top. This is called [[quantum tunneling]]. It is related to the distribution of energy: although the ball's assumed position seems to be on one side of the hill, there is a chance of finding it on the other side.\n\n===Particles as waves===\n{{main|Matter wave|Wave\u2013particle duality|Double-slit experiment}}\n\n[[File:Double-slit experiment results Tanamura 2.jpg|175px|thumb|A double slit experiment showing the accumulation of electrons on a screen as time passes.]]\n\nThe nonrelativistic Schr\u00f6dinger equation is a type of [[partial differential equation]] called a [[wave equation]]. Therefore, it is often said particles can exhibit behavior usually attributed to waves. In some modern interpretations this description is reversed \u2013 the quantum state, i.e. wave, is the only genuine physical reality, and under the appropriate conditions it can show features of particle-like behavior. However, Ballentine<ref name=Ballentine>{{citation|last=Ballentine|first=Leslie|title=Quantum Mechanics: A Modern Development | publisher=World Scientific Publishing Co.|year=1998| isbn = 978-9810241056}}</ref>{{rp|Chapter 4, p.99}} shows that such an interpretation has problems. Ballentine points out that whilst it is arguable to associate a physical wave with a single particle, there is still only ''one'' Schr\u00f6dinger wave equation for many particles. He points out:\n:''\"If a physical wave field were associated with a particle, or if a particle were identified with a wave packet, then corresponding to N interacting particles there should be N interacting waves in ordinary three-dimensional space. But according to (4.6) that is not the case; instead there is one \"wave\" function in an abstract 3N-dimensional configuration space. The misinterpretation of psi as a physical wave in ordinary space is possible only because the most common applications of quantum mechanics are to one-particle states, for which configuration space and ordinary space are isomorphic.\"''\n\n[[Double-slit experiment|Two-slit diffraction]] is a famous example of the strange behaviors that waves regularly display, that are not intuitively associated with particles. The overlapping waves from the two slits cancel each other out in some locations, and reinforce each other in other locations, causing a complex pattern to emerge. Intuitively, one would not expect this pattern from firing a single particle at the slits, because the particle should pass through one slit or the other, not a complex overlap of both.\n\nHowever, since the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is a [[wave equation]], a single particle fired through a double-slit ''does'' show this same pattern (figure on right). The experiment must be repeated many times for the complex pattern to emerge. Although this is counterintuitive, the prediction is correct; in particular, [[electron diffraction]] and [[neutron diffraction]] are well understood and widely used in science and engineering.\n\nRelated to [[diffraction]], particles also display [[Superposition principle#Application to waves|superposition]] and [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]].\n\nThe superposition property allows the particle to be in a [[quantum superposition]] of two or more quantum states at the same time. However, a \"quantum state\" in quantum mechanics means the ''probability'' that a system will be, for example at a position {{math|''x''}}, not that the system will actually be at position {{math|''x''}}. It does not imply that the particle itself may be in two classical states at once. Indeed, quantum mechanics is generally unable to assign values for properties prior to measurement at all.\n\n====Measurement and uncertainty====\n{{main|Measurement in quantum mechanics|Heisenberg uncertainty principle|Interpretations of quantum mechanics}}\nIn classical mechanics, a particle has, at every moment, an exact position and an exact momentum. These values change [[determinism|deterministically]] as the particle moves according to [[Newton's laws]]. Under the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics, particles do not have exactly determined properties, and when they are measured, the result is randomly drawn from a [[probability distribution]]. The Schr\u00f6dinger equation predicts what the probability distributions are, but fundamentally cannot predict the exact result of each measurement.\n\nThe [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] is one statement of the inherent measurement uncertainty in quantum mechanics. It states that the more precisely a particle's position is known, the less precisely its momentum is known, and vice versa.\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation describes the (deterministic) evolution of the [[wave function]] of a particle. However, even if the wave function is known exactly, the result of a specific measurement on the wave function is uncertain.\n\n==Interpretation of the wave function==\n{{main|Interpretations of quantum mechanics}}\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation provides a way to calculate the wave function of a system and how it changes dynamically in time. However, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation does not directly say ''what'', exactly, the wave function is. [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics]] address questions such as what the relation is between the wave function, the underlying reality, and the results of experimental measurements.\n\nAn important aspect is the relationship between the Schr\u00f6dinger equation and [[wave function collapse]]. In the oldest [[Copenhagen interpretation]], particles follow the Schr\u00f6dinger equation ''except'' during wave function collapse, during which they behave entirely differently. The advent of [[quantum decoherence|quantum decoherence theory]] allowed alternative approaches (such as the [[Everett many-worlds interpretation]] and [[consistent histories]]), wherein the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is ''always'' satisfied, and wave function collapse should be explained as a consequence of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\n\nIn 1952, [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]] gave a lecture during which he commented,\n:Nearly every result [a quantum theorist] pronounces is about the probability of this ''or'' that or that ... happening\u2014with usually a great many alternatives. The idea that they be not alternatives but ''all'' really happen simultaneously seems lunatic to him, just ''impossible.''<ref>{{cite book|last=Schr\u00f6dinger |first=Erwin |authorlink=Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger|title=The interpretation of quantum mechanics: Dublin seminars (1949\u20131955) and other unpublished essays |year=1995 |publisher=Ox Bow Press |isbn=9781881987086}}</ref>\n\n[[David Deutsch]] regarded this as the earliest known reference to a many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, an interpretation generally credited to [[Hugh Everett III]],<ref>David Deutsch, ''The Beginning of Infinity'', page 310</ref> while [[Jeffrey A.

Since energy and [[momentum]] are related in the same way as [[frequency]] and [[wavenumber|wave number]] in [[special relativity]], it followed that the momentum <math>p</math> of a photon is inversely proportional to its [[wavelength]] <math>\\lambda</math>, or proportional to its wave number <math>k</math>:\n\n:<math>p = \\frac{h}{\\lambda} = \\hbar k,</math>\n\nwhere <math>h</math> is [[Planck's constant]] and <math>\\hbar = {h}/{2\\pi}</math> is the reduced Planck constant (or the Dirac constant). [[Louis de Broglie]] hypothesized that this is true for all particles, even particles which have mass such as electrons.

A spike of heat will decay in amplitude and spread out; however, because the imaginary i is the generator of rotations in the complex plane, a spike in the amplitude of a matter wave will also rotate in the complex plane over time. The solutions are therefore functions which describe wave-like motions.

The basis for Schr\u00f6dinger's equation, on the other hand, is the energy of the system and a separate [[Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics#Postulates of quantum mechanics|postulate of quantum mechanics]]: the wave function is a description of the system.<ref name=\"Quantum Chemistry 1977\">''Molecular Quantum Mechanics Parts I and II: An Introduction to Quantum Chemistry'' (Volume 1), P.

However, there can be [[interactions#Physics|interactions]] between the particles (an [[many body problem|{{math|''N''}}-body problem]]), so the potential energy {{math|''V''}} can change as the spatial configuration of particles changes, and possibly with time. The potential energy, in general, is ''not'' the sum of the separate potential energies for each particle, it is a function of all the spatial positions of the particles. Explicitly:\n\n:<math>E=\\sum_{n=1}^N \\frac{\\mathbf{p}_n\\cdot\\mathbf{p}_n}{2m_n} + V(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\mathbf{r}_2,\\ldots,\\mathbf{r}_N,t) = H \\,\\!</math>\n\n=== Linearity ===\nThe simplest wave function is a [[plane wave]] of the form:\n\n:<math> \\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t) = A e^{i(\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}-\\omega t)}</math>\n\nwhere the {{math|''A''}} is the amplitude, {{math|'''k'''}} the wave vector, and <math>\\omega</math> the angular frequency, of the plane wave. In general, physical situations are not purely described by plane waves, so for generality the [[superposition principle]] is required; any wave can be made by superposition of sinusoidal plane waves. So if the equation is linear, a [[linear combination]] of plane waves is also an allowed solution. Hence a necessary and separate requirement is that the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is a [[linear differential equation]].\n\nFor discrete <math>\\mathbf{k}</math> the sum is a [[superposition principle#Application to waves|superposition]] of plane waves:\n\n:<math> \\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty A_n e^{i(\\mathbf{k}_n\\cdot\\mathbf{r}-\\omega_n t)} \\,\\!</math>\n\nfor some real amplitude coefficients <math>A_n</math>, and for continuous <math>\\mathbf{k}</math> the sum becomes an integral, the [[Fourier transform]] of a momentum space wave function:<ref name=\"Quantum Mechanics Demystified 2006\">''Quantum Mechanics Demystified'', D.

In practice, [[natural units]] comprising <math>\\hbar = 1</math> are used, as the De Broglie ''equations'' reduce to ''identities'': allowing momentum, wave number, energy and frequency to be used interchangeably, to prevent duplication of quantities, and reduce the number of dimensions of related quantities. For familiarity SI units are still used in this article.\n\nSchr\u00f6dinger's insight,{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} late in 1925, was to express the [[Phase (waves)|phase]] of a [[plane wave]] as a [[complex number|complex]] [[phase factor]] using these relations:\n\n:<math>\\Psi = Ae^{i(\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}-\\omega t)} = Ae^{i(\\mathbf{p}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}-Et)/\\hbar} </math>\n\nand to realize that the first order [[partial derivatives]] with respect to space were\n\n:<math> \\nabla\\Psi = \\dfrac{i}{\\hbar}\\mathbf{p}Ae^{i(\\mathbf{p}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}-Et)/\\hbar} = \\dfrac{i}{\\hbar}\\mathbf{p}\\Psi. </math>\n\nTaking partial derivatives with respect to time gives\n\n:<math> \\dfrac{\\partial \\Psi}{\\partial t} = -\\dfrac{i E}{\\hbar} Ae^{i(\\mathbf{p}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}-Et)/\\hbar} = -\\dfrac{i E}{\\hbar} \\Psi. </math>\n\nAnother postulate of quantum mechanics is that all observables are represented by [[linear operator|linear]] [[Self-adjoint operator|Hermitian operators]] which act on the wave function, and the eigenvalues of the operator are the values the observable takes. The previous derivatives are consistent with the [[energy operator]] (or Hamiltonian operator), corresponding to the time derivative,\n\n:<math>\\hat{E} \\Psi = i\\hbar\\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\Psi = E\\Psi  </math>\n\nwhere {{math|''E''}} are the energy [[eigenvalue]]s, and the [[momentum operator]], corresponding to the spatial derivatives (the [[del|gradient]] <math>\\nabla </math>),\n\n:<math>\\hat{\\mathbf{p}} \\Psi = -i\\hbar\\nabla \\Psi = \\mathbf{p} \\Psi </math>\n\nwhere {{math|'''p'''}} is a vector of the momentum eigenvalues. In the above, the \"[[circumflex|hats]]\" ( {{math|\u02c6}} ) indicate these observables are operators, not simply ordinary numbers or vectors. The energy and momentum operators are ''[[differential operators]]'', while the potential energy operator <math>V</math> is just a multiplicative factor.\n\nSubstituting the energy and momentum operators into the classical energy conservation equation obtains the operator:\n\n:<math>E= \\dfrac{\\mathbf{p}\\cdot\\mathbf{p}}{2m}+V \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad \\hat{E} = \\dfrac{\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}}{2m}  + V </math>\n\nso in terms of derivatives with respect to time and space, acting this operator on the wave function {{math|''\u03a8''}} immediately led Schr\u00f6dinger to his equation:{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n:<math>i\\hbar\\dfrac{\\partial \\Psi}{\\partial t}= -\\dfrac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\nabla^2\\Psi +V\\Psi</math>\n\nWave\u2013particle duality can be assessed from these equations as follows. The kinetic energy {{math|''T''}} is related to the square of momentum {{math|'''p'''}}. As the particle's momentum increases, the kinetic energy increases more rapidly, but since the wave number {{math|{{!}}'''k'''{{!}}}} increases the wavelength {{math|''\u03bb''}} decreases. In terms of ordinary scalar and vector quantities (not operators):\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{p}\\cdot\\mathbf{p} \\propto \\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{k} \\propto T \\propto \\dfrac{1}{\\lambda^2}</math>\n\nThe kinetic energy is also proportional to the second spatial derivatives, so it is also proportional to the magnitude of the ''[[curvature]]'' of the wave, in terms of operators:\n\n:<math> \\hat{T} \\Psi = \\frac{-\\hbar^2}{2m}\\nabla\\cdot\\nabla  \\Psi \\, \\propto \\, \\nabla^2 \\Psi \\,.</math>\n\nAs the curvature increases, the amplitude of the wave alternates between positive and negative more rapidly, and also shortens the wavelength. So the inverse relation between momentum and wavelength is consistent with the energy the particle has, and so the energy of the particle has a connection to a wave, all in the same mathematical formulation.<ref name=\"Quanta 1974\"/>\n\n===Wave and particle motion===\n {{multiple image\n   | align = right\n   | direction = horizontal\n   | image1    = Quantum mechanics travelling wavefunctions.svg\n   | caption1  = Increasing levels of [[wavepacket]] localization, meaning the particle has a more localized position.\n   | width1     = 400\n   | image2    = Perfect localization.svg\n   | caption2  = In the limit ''\u0127'' \u2192 0, the particle's position and momentum become known exactly.

Since, for a given spread in {{math|'''k'''}}, the spread in velocity is proportional to Planck's constant <math>\\hbar</math>, it is sometimes said that in the limit as <math>\\hbar</math> approaches zero, the equations of classical mechanics are restored from quantum mechanics.<ref name=\"Analytical Mechanics 2008\">''Analytical Mechanics'', L.

The quantum expectation values satisfy the [[Ehrenfest theorem]]. For a one-dimensional quantum particle moving in a potential <math>V</math>, the Ehrenfest theorem says<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Section 3.7.5</ref>\n:<math>m\\frac{d}{dt}\\langle x\\rangle = \\langle p\\rangle;\\quad \\frac{d}{dt}\\langle p\\rangle =  -\\left\\langle V'(X)\\right\\rangle .</math>\nAlthough the first of these equations is consistent with the classical behavior, the second is not: If the pair <math>(\\langle X\\rangle,\\langle P\\rangle)</math> were to satisfy Newton's second law, the right-hand side of the second equation would have to be\n:<math>-V'\\left(\\left\\langle X\\right\\rangle\\right)</math>,\nwhich is typically not the same as <math>-\\left\\langle V'(X)\\right\\rangle</math>. In the case of the quantum harmonic oscillator, however, <math>V'</math> is linear and this distinction disappears, so that in this very special case, the expected position and expected momentum do exactly follow the classical trajectories.\n\nFor general systems, the best we can hope for is that the expected position and momentum will ''approximately'' follow the classical trajectories. If the wave function is highly concentrated around a point <math>x_0</math>, then <math>V'\\left(\\left\\langle X\\right\\rangle\\right)</math> and <math>\\left\\langle V'(X)\\right\\rangle</math> will be ''almost'' the same, since both will be approximately equal to <math>V'(x_0)</math>. In that case, the expected position and expected momentum will remain very close to the classical trajectories, at least for as long as the wave function remains highly localized in position.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} p. 78</ref> When Planck's constant is small, it is possible to have a state that is well localized in ''both'' position and momentum. The small uncertainty in momentum ensures that the particle ''remains'' well localized in position for a long time, so that expected position and momentum continue to closely track the classical trajectories.\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation in its general form\n\n:<math> i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\Psi\\left(\\mathbf{r},t\\right) = \\hat{H} \\Psi\\left(\\mathbf{r},t\\right) \\,\\!</math>\n\nis closely related to the [[Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation]] (HJE)\n\n:<math> -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} S(q_i,t) = H\\left(q_i,\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial q_i},t \\right) \\,\\!</math>\n\nwhere <math>S</math> is the classical [[action (physics)|action]] and <math>H</math> is the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian function]] (not operator).

On the contrary, the Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation applies to a (classical) particle of definite position and momentum, instead the position and momentum at all times (the trajectory) are deterministic and can be simultaneously known.\n\n==Nonrelativistic quantum mechanics==\nThe quantum mechanics of particles without accounting for the effects of [[special relativity]], for example particles propagating at speeds much less than [[speed of light|light]], is known as '''nonrelativistic quantum mechanics'''. Following are several forms of Schr\u00f6dinger's equation in this context for different situations: time independence and dependence, one and three spatial dimensions, and one and {{math|''N''}} particles.\n\nIn actuality, the particles constituting the system do not have the numerical labels used in theory. The language of mathematics forces us to label the positions of particles one way or another, otherwise there would be confusion between symbols representing which variables are for which particle.<ref name=\"Atoms, Molecules 1985\">''Quantum Physics of Atoms, Molecules, Solids, Nuclei and Particles'' (2nd Edition), R.

In general, the wave function takes the form:\n\n:<math>\\Psi(\\text{space coords},t)=\\psi(\\text{space coords})\\tau(t)\\,.</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''\u03c8''(space coords)}} is a function of all the spatial coordinate(s) of the particle(s) constituting the system only, and {{math|''\u03c4''(''t'')}} is a function of time only.\n\nSubstituting for {{math|''&psi;''}} into the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the relevant number of particles in the relevant number of dimensions, solving by [[separation of variables]] implies the general solution of the time-dependent equation has the form:<ref name=\"verlagsgesellschaft1991\"/>\n\n:<math> \\Psi(\\text{space coords},t) = \\psi(\\text{space coords}) e^{-i{E t/\\hbar}} \\,.</math>\n\nSince the time dependent phase factor is always the same, only the spatial part needs to be solved for in time independent problems. Additionally, the energy operator {{math|''\u00ca'' {{=}} ''i\u0127''{{sfrac|\u2202|\u2202''t''}}}} can always be replaced by the energy eigenvalue {{math|''E''}}, thus the time independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation is an [[eigenvalue]] equation for the Hamiltonian operator:<ref name=Shankar1994/>{{rp|143ff}}\n:<math>\\hat{H} \\psi = E \\psi </math>\n\nThis is true for any number of particles in any number of dimensions (in a time independent potential). This case describes the [[standing wave]] solutions of the time-dependent equation, which are the states with definite energy (instead of a probability distribution of different energies). In physics, these standing waves are called \"[[stationary state]]s\" or \"[[energy eigenstate]]s\"; in chemistry they are called \"[[atomic orbital]]s\" or \"[[molecular orbital]]s\". Superpositions of energy eigenstates change their properties according to the relative phases between the energy levels.\n\nThe energy eigenvalues from this equation form a discrete [[Spectrum (functional analysis)|spectrum]] of values, so mathematically energy must be quantized. More specifically, the energy eigenstates form a basis \u2013 any wave function may be written as a sum over the discrete energy states or an integral over continuous energy states, or more generally as an integral over a measure.

If the potential {{math|''V''<sub>0</sub>}} grows to infinity, the motion is classically confined to a finite region.

Ultimately, these properties arise from the Hamiltonian used, and the solutions to the equation.\n\n===Linearity===\n{{See also|Linear differential equation}}\n\nIn the development above, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation was made to be linear for generality, though this has other implications. If two wave functions {{math|''\u03c8''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''\u03c8''<sub>2</sub>}} are solutions, then so is any [[linear combination]] of the two:\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle \\psi = a\\psi_1 + b \\psi_2 </math>\n\nwhere {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are any complex numbers (the sum can be extended for any number of wave functions). This property allows [[Quantum superposition|superpositions of quantum states]] to be solutions of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Even more generally, it holds that a general solution to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be found by taking a weighted sum over all single state solutions achievable. For example, consider a wave function {{math|''\u03a8''(''x'', ''t'')}} such that the wave function is a product of two functions: one time independent, and one time dependent. If states of definite energy found using the time independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation are given by {{math|''\u03c8<sub>E</sub>''(''x'')}} with amplitude {{math|''A<sub>n</sub>''}} and time dependent phase factor is given by\n\n:<math>e^{{-iE_n t}/\\hbar}, </math>\n\nthen a valid general solution is\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle \\Psi(x,t) = \\sum\\limits_{n} A_n \\psi_{E_n}(x) e^{{-iE_n t}/\\hbar}. </math>\n\nAdditionally, the ability to scale solutions allows one to solve for a wave function without normalizing it first. If one has a set of normalized solutions {{math|''\u03c8<sub>n</sub>''}}, then\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle \\Psi = \\sum\\limits_{n} A_n \\psi_n </math>\n\ncan be normalized by ensuring that\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle \\sum\\limits_{n}|A_n|^2 = 1. </math>\n\nThis is much more convenient than having to verify that\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle \\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}|\\Psi(x)|^2\\,dx = \\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\Psi(x)\\Psi^{*}(x)\\,dx = 1. </math>\n\n=== Momentum space Schr\u00f6dinger equation ===\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation <math>i\\hbar \\partial_t |\\psi\\rangle = \\hat{H}|\\psi \\rangle </math> is often presented in the position basis form <math>i\\hbar \\partial_t \\psi(x) = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\nabla^2\\psi(x) + V(x)\\psi(x) </math> (with <math>\\langle x |\\psi\\rangle \\equiv \\psi(x) </math>). But as a vector operator equation it has a valid representation in any arbitrary complete basis of kets in [[Hilbert space]]. For example, in the momentum space basis the equation reads\n\n<math>\\displaystyle i\\hbar \\partial_t f(p) = \\frac{p^2}{2m}f(p) + (\\tilde{V}*f) (p) </math>\n\nwhere <math>|p\\rangle </math> is the plane wave state of definite momentum <math>p </math>, <math>\\langle p |\\psi\\rangle \\equiv f(p) = \\int \\psi(x)e^{-ipx}dx </math>, <math>\\tilde{V} </math> is the Fourier transform of <math>V </math>, and <math>* </math> denotes [[Convolution theorem|Fourier convolution]].\n\nIn the 1D example with absence of a potential, <math>\\tilde V = 0 </math> (or similarly <math>\\tilde V(k) \\propto \\delta(k) </math> in the case of a background potential constant throughout space), each stationary state of energy <math> \\hbar \\omega = q^2/2m </math> is of the form\n\n<math> f_q(p) = (c_{+}\\delta(p-q)+c_{-}\\delta(p+q))e^{-i\\omega t} </math>\n\nfor arbitrary complex coefficients <math> c_{\\pm} </math>. Such a wave function, as expected in free space, is a superposition of plane waves moving right and left with momenta <math> \\pm q </math>; upon momentum measurement the state would collapse to one of definite momentum <math> \\pm q </math> with probability <math> \\propto |c_{\\pm}|^2 </math>.\n\nA version of the momentum space Schr\u00f6dinger equation is often used in [[solid-state physics]], as [[Bloch's Theorem|Bloch's theorem]] ensures the periodic crystal lattice potential couples <math>f(p) </math> with <math>f(p+K) </math> for only discrete [[reciprocal lattice]] vectors <math>K </math>. This makes it convenient to solve the momentum space Schr\u00f6dinger equation at each [[Crystal momentum|point]] in the [[Brillouin zone]] independently of the other points in the Brillouin zone.\n\n=== Real energy eigenstates ===\nFor the time-independent equation, an additional feature of linearity follows: if two wave functions {{math|''\u03c8''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''&psi;''<sub>2</sub>}} are solutions to the time-independent equation with the same energy {{math|''E''}}, then so is any linear combination:\n\n:<math> \\hat H (a\\psi_1 + b \\psi_2 ) = a \\hat H \\psi_1 + b \\hat H \\psi_2 = E (a \\psi_1 + b\\psi_2). </math>\n\nTwo different solutions with the same energy are called ''degenerate''.<ref name=\"Quantum Mechanics Demystified 2006\"/>\n\nIn an arbitrary potential, if a wave function {{math|''\u03c8''}} solves the time-independent equation, so does its [[complex conjugate]], denoted {{math|''\u03c8''*}}. By taking linear combinations, the real and imaginary parts of {{math|''\u03c8''}} are each solutions. If there is no degeneracy they can only differ by a factor.\n\nIn the time-dependent equation, complex conjugate waves move in opposite directions. If {{math|''\u03a8''(''x'', ''t'')}} is one solution, then so is {{math|''\u03a8''*(''x'', \u2013''t'')}}. The symmetry of complex conjugation is called [[T-symmetry|time-reversal symmetry]].\n\n===Space and time derivatives===\n[[File:Wavefunction continuity space.svg|250px|thumb|Continuity of the wave function and its first spatial derivative (in the {{math|''x''}} direction, {{math|''y''}} and {{math|''z''}} coordinates not shown), at some time {{math|''t''}}.]]\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation is first order in time and second in space, which describes the time evolution of a quantum state (meaning it determines the future amplitude from the present).\n\nExplicitly for one particle in 3-dimensional Cartesian coordinates \u2013 the equation is\n\n:<math>i\\hbar{\\partial \\Psi \\over \\partial t} = - {\\hbar^2\\over 2m} \\left ( {\\partial^2 \\Psi \\over \\partial x^2} + {\\partial^2 \\Psi \\over \\partial y^2} + {\\partial^2 \\Psi \\over \\partial z^2} \\right ) + V(x,y,z,t)\\Psi.\\,\\!</math>\n\nThe first time partial derivative implies the initial value (at {{math|''t'' {{=}} 0}}) of the wave function\n\n:<math> \\Psi(x,y,z,0) \\,\\!</math>\n\nis an arbitrary constant. Likewise \u2013 the second order derivatives with respect to space implies the wave function ''and'' its first order spatial derivatives\n\n:<math> \\begin{align} \n& \\Psi(x_b,y_b,z_b,t) \\\\\n& \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\Psi(x_b,y_b,z_b,t) \\quad \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\Psi(x_b,y_b,z_b,t) \\quad \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\Psi(x_b,y_b,z_b,t) \n\\end{align} \\,\\!</math>\n\nare all arbitrary constants at a given set of points, where {{math|''x<sub>b</sub>''}}, {{math|''y<sub>b</sub>''}}, {{math|''z<sub>b</sub>''}} are a set of points describing boundary {{math|''b''}} (derivatives are evaluated at the boundaries). Typically there are one or two boundaries, such as the [[step potential]] and [[particle in a box]] respectively.\n\nAs the first order derivatives are arbitrary, the wave function can be a [[smooth function|continuously differentiable function]] of space, since at any boundary the gradient of the wave function can be matched.\n\nOn the contrary, wave equations in physics are usually ''second order in time'', notable are the family of classical [[wave equation]]s and the quantum [[Klein\u2013Gordon equation]].\n\n=== Local conservation of probability ===\n{{Main|Probability current|Continuity equation}}\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation is consistent with [[conservation of probability|probability conservation]]. Multiplying the Schr\u00f6dinger equation on the right by the complex conjugate wave function, and multiplying the wave function to the left of the complex conjugate of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, and subtracting, gives the [[Continuity equation#Quantum mechanics|continuity equation]] for probability:<ref name=\"Quantum Mechanics 2004\">''Quantum Mechanics'', E. Abers, Pearson Ed., Addison Wesley, Prentice Hall Inc, 2004, {{isbn|978-0-13-146100-0}}</ref>\n:<math>{ \\partial \\over \\partial t} \\rho\\left(\\mathbf{r},t\\right) + \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{j} = 0, </math>\nwhere \n:<math>\\rho=|\\Psi|^2=\\Psi^*(\\mathbf{r},t)\\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t)\\,\\!</math>\nis the [[probability density function|probability density]] (probability per unit volume, {{math|*}} denotes [[complex conjugate]]), and\n:<math> \\mathbf{j} = {1 \\over 2m} \\left( \\Psi^*\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}\\Psi  - \\Psi\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}\\Psi^* \\right)\\,\\!</math>\nis the [[probability current]] (flow per unit area).\n\nHence predictions from the Schr\u00f6dinger equation do not violate probability conservation.\n\n=== Positive energy ===\nIf the potential is bounded from below, meaning there is a minimum value of potential energy, the eigenfunctions of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation have energy which is also bounded from below. This can be seen most easily by using the [[variational principle]], as follows. (See also below).\n\nFor any linear operator {{math|''\u00c2''}} [[Bounded operator|bounded]] from below, the eigenvector with the smallest eigenvalue is the vector {{math|''\u03c8''}} that minimizes the quantity\n\n:<math> \\langle \\psi |\\hat{A}|\\psi \\rangle </math>\n\nover all {{math|''\u03c8''}} which are [[normalizable wave function|normalized]].<ref name=\"Quantum Mechanics 2004\"/> In this way, the smallest eigenvalue is expressed through the [[variational principle]]. For the Schr\u00f6dinger Hamiltonian {{math|''\u0124''}} bounded from below, the smallest eigenvalue is called the ground state energy. That energy is the minimum value of\n\n:<math>\\langle \\psi|\\hat{H}|\\psi\\rangle = \\int \\psi^*(\\mathbf{r}) \\left[ - \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\nabla^2\\psi(\\mathbf{r}) + V(\\mathbf{r})\\psi(\\mathbf{r})\\right] d^3\\mathbf{r} = \\int \\left[ \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}|\\nabla\\psi|^2 + V(\\mathbf{r}) |\\psi|^2 \\right] d^3\\mathbf{r} = \\langle \\hat{H}\\rangle </math>\n\n(using [[integration by parts]]). Due to the [[Absolute value#Complex numbers|complex modulus]] of {{math|''\u03c8''<sup>2</sup>}} (which is positive definite), the right hand side is always greater than the lowest value of {{math|''V''(''x'')}}. In particular, the ground state energy is positive when {{math|''V''(''x'')}} is everywhere positive.\n\nFor potentials which are bounded below and are not infinite over a region, there is a ground state which minimizes the integral above. This lowest energy wave function is real and positive definite \u2013 meaning the wave function can increase and decrease, but is positive for all positions. It physically cannot be negative: if it were, smoothing out the bends at the sign change (to minimize the wave function) rapidly reduces the gradient contribution to the integral and hence the kinetic energy, while the potential energy changes linearly and less quickly. The kinetic and potential energy are both changing at different rates, so the total energy is not constant, which can't happen (conservation). The solutions are consistent with Schr\u00f6dinger equation if this wave function is positive definite.\n\nThe lack of sign changes also shows that the ground state is nondegenerate, since if there were two ground states with common energy {{math|''E''}}, not proportional to each other, there would be a linear combination of the two that would also be a ground state resulting in a zero solution.\n\n===Analytic continuation to diffusion===\n{{see also|path integral formulation#The Schr\u00f6dinger equation|label 1=Path integral formulation (The Schr\u00f6dinger equation)}}\n\nThe above properties (positive definiteness of energy) allow the [[analytic continuation]] of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation to be identified as a [[stochastic process]]. This can be interpreted as the [[Huygens\u2013Fresnel principle]] applied to De Broglie waves; the spreading wavefronts are diffusive probability amplitudes.<ref name=\"Quantum Mechanics 2004\"/> \nFor a free particle (not subject to a potential) in a [[random walk]], substituting {{math|''\u03c4'' {{=}} ''it''}} into the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation gives:<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.82.011132 |pmid=20866590|url=http://www.stt.msu.edu/~mcubed/Relativistic.pdf|title=Stochastic models for relativistic diffusion|journal=Physical Review E|volume=82|issue=1 Pt 1|pages=011132|year=2010|last1=Baeumer|first1=Boris|last2=Meerschaert|first2=Mark M.|last3=Naber|first3=Mark|bibcode=2010PhRvE..82a1132B}}</ref>\n\n:<math> {\\partial \\over \\partial \\tau} X(\\mathbf{r},\\tau) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2m} \\nabla ^2 X(\\mathbf{r},\\tau) \\, , \\quad X(\\mathbf{r},\\tau) = \\Psi(\\mathbf{r},\\tau/i)</math>\n\nwhich has the same form as the [[diffusion equation]], with diffusion coefficient {{math|{{sfrac|''\u0127''|2''m''}}}}.\n\n===Regularity===\nOn the space <math>L^2</math> of square-integrable densities, the Schr\u00f6dinger semigroup <math>e^{it\\hat{H}}</math> is a unitary evolution, and therefore surjective. The flows satisfy the Schr\u00f6dinger equation <math>i\\partial_t u = \\hat{H}u</math>, where the derivative is taken in the [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] sense. However, since <math>\\hat{H}</math> for most physically reasonable Hamiltonians (e.g., the [[Laplace operator]], possibly modified by a potential) is unbounded in <math>L^2</math>, this shows that the semigroup flows lack Sobolev regularity in general. Instead, solutions of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation satisfy a [[Strichartz estimate]].\n\n==Relativistic quantum mechanics==\n[[Relativistic quantum mechanics]] is obtained where quantum mechanics and [[special relativity]] simultaneously apply. In general, one wishes to build [[relativistic wave equations]] from the relativistic [[energy\u2013momentum relation]]\n\n:<math>E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2 \\, , </math>\n\ninstead of classical energy equations. The [[Klein\u2013Gordon equation]] and the [[Dirac equation]] are two such equations. The Klein\u2013Gordon equation,\n\n:<math> \\frac {1}{c^2} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial t^2} \\psi - \\nabla^2 \\psi + \\frac {m^2 c^2}{\\hbar^2} \\psi = 0. </math>,\n\nwas the first such equation to be obtained, even before the nonrelativistic one, and applies to massive spinless particles. The Dirac equation arose from taking the \"square root\" of the Klein\u2013Gordon equation by factorizing the entire relativistic wave operator into a product of two operators \u2013 one of these is the operator for the entire Dirac equation. Entire Dirac equation:\n:<math>\\left(\\beta mc^2 + c\\left(\\sum_{n \\mathop =1}^{3}\\alpha_n p_n\\right)\\right) \\psi = i \\hbar \\frac{\\partial\\psi }{\\partial t} </math>\n\nThe general form of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation remains true in relativity, but the Hamiltonian is less obvious. For example, the Dirac Hamiltonian for a particle of mass {{math|''m''}} and electric charge {{math|''q''}} in an electromagnetic field (described by the [[electromagnetic potential]]s {{math|''\u03c6''}} and {{math|'''A'''}}) is:\n\n:<math>\\hat{H}_{\\text{Dirac}}= \\gamma^0 \\left[c  \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}\\cdot\\left(\\hat{\\mathbf{p}} - q \\mathbf{A}\\right) + mc^2 + \\gamma^0q \\varphi \\right]\\,, </math>\n\nin which the {{math|'''\u03b3''' {{=}} (''\u03b3''<sup>1</sup>, ''\u03b3''<sup>2</sup>, ''\u03b3''<sup>3</sup>)}} and {{math|''\u03b3''<sup>0</sup>}} are the Dirac [[gamma matrices]] related to the spin of the particle. The Dirac equation is true for all {{nobreak|[[spin-1/2|spin-{{frac|2}}]]}} particles, and the solutions to the equation are {{nobreak|4-component}} [[spinor field]]s with two components corresponding to the particle and the other two for the [[antiparticle]].\n\nFor the Klein\u2013Gordon equation, the general form of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is inconvenient to use, and in practice the Hamiltonian is not expressed in an analogous way to the Dirac Hamiltonian. The equations for relativistic quantum fields can be obtained in other ways, such as starting from a [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian density]] and using the [[Euler\u2013Lagrange equation]]s for fields, or use the [[representation theory of the Lorentz group]] in which certain representations can be used to fix the equation for a free particle of given spin (and mass).\n\nIn general, the Hamiltonian to be substituted in the general Schr\u00f6dinger equation is not just a function of the position and momentum operators (and possibly time), but also of spin matrices. Also, the solutions to a relativistic wave equation, for a massive particle of spin {{math|''s''}}, are complex-valued {{nobreak|{{math|2(2''s'' + 1)}}-component}} [[spinor field]]s.\n\n==Quantum field theory==\nThe general equation is also valid and used in [[quantum field theory]], both in relativistic and nonrelativistic situations. However, the solution {{math|''\u03c8''}} is no longer interpreted as a \"wave\", but should be interpreted as an operator acting on states existing in a [[Fock space]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n==First order form==\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation can also be derived from a first order form<ref  name=\"one\">{{cite journal|last1=Ajaib|first1=Muhammad Adeel|title=A Fundamental Form of the Schr\u00f6dinger Equation|journal=Found.

Those two parameters are sufficient to describe its state at each time instant. In quantum mechanics, the analogue of Newton's law is Schr\u00f6dinger's equation.\n\nThe concept of a wave function is a fundamental [[Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics|postulate of quantum mechanics]]; the wave function defines the state of the system at each spatial position, and time.

The general equation is indeed quite general, used throughout quantum mechanics, for everything from the [[Dirac equation]] to [[quantum field theory]], by plugging in diverse expressions for the Hamiltonian. The specific nonrelativistic version is a strictly classical approximation to reality and yields accurate results in many situations, but only to a certain extent (see [[relativistic quantum mechanics]] and [[relativistic quantum field theory]]).\n\nTo apply the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, write down the Hamiltonian for the system, accounting for the kinetic and potential energies of the particles constituting the system, then insert it into the Schr\u00f6dinger equation.

However, even in this case the total wave function still has a time dependency.\n\nIn the language of [[linear algebra]], this equation is an [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalue equation]]. Therefore, the wave function is an [[eigenfunction]] of the Hamiltonian operator with corresponding eigenvalue(s) <math>E</math>.\n\nAs before, the most common manifestation is the [[relativistic quantum mechanics|nonrelativistic]] Schr\u00f6dinger equation for a single particle moving in an electric field (but not a magnetic field):\n\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent=:\n|title='''Time-independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation''' (''single nonrelativistic particle'')\n|equation=<math>\\left[ \\frac{-\\hbar^2}{2m}\\nabla^2 + V(\\mathbf{r}) \\right] \\Psi(\\mathbf{r}) = E \\Psi(\\mathbf{r})</math>\n|cellpadding\n|border\n|border colour = rgb(0,115,207)\n|background colour = rgb(0,115,207,10%)}}\n\nwith definitions as above.

Suppose the [[wave function]] <math>\\psi(t_0)</math> represents a unit vector defined on a complex [[Hilbert space]] at some initial time <math>t_0</math>. The [[Unitarity (physics)|unitarity principle]] requires that there must exist a linear operator, <math>\\hat{U}(t)</math>, such that for any time <math>t > t_0</math>,\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\psi(t) = \\hat{U}(t)\\psi(t_0).</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\nGiven that <math>\\psi(t)</math> must remain a unit vector, the operator <math>\\hat{U}(t)</math> must therefore be a [[Unitary transformation (quantum mechanics)|unitary transformation]]. As such, there exists an [[Exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential map]] such that <math>\\hat{U}(t) = e^{-i\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}t}</math> where <math>\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}</math> is a [[Hermitian operator]] (given by the fact that the [[Lie algebra]] of the [[unitary group]] is generated by skew-[[Hermitian operators]], and if <math>\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}</math> is Hermitian, then <math>-i \\hat{\\mathcal{H}}</math> is skew-Hermitian). Therefore, the first-order Taylor expansion of <math>\\hat{U}(t)</math> centered at <math>t_0</math> takes the form\n:<math>\\hat{U}(t) \\approx 1 - i(t-t_0)\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}.</math>\n\nAnd so, substituting the above expansion into ({{EquationNote|1}}) thus yields\n:<math>\\psi(t) = \\psi(t_0) - i(t-t_0)\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}\\psi(t_0),</math>\n\nwhich, when rearranged and taken in the limit <math>t \\rightarrow t_0</math>, provides an equation of the same form as the Schr&ouml;dinger equation\n:<math>i\\frac{d\\psi}{dt} = \\hat{\\mathcal{H}}\\psi,</math>\n\nwhere the ordinary definition for the derivative was used. However, the operator <math>\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}</math> used here denotes an ''arbitrary'' Hermitian operator. Nonetheless, by using the [[correspondence principle]] it is possible to show that in the classical limit, using appropriate units, the expectation value of <math>\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}</math> indeed corresponds to the Hamiltonian of the system.<ref>{{cite book|title=Modern Quantum Mechanics|last1=Sakurai|first1=J. J.|date=1995|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Reading, Massachusetts|page=68}}</ref>\n\n==Implications==\n===Energy===\nThe Hamiltonian is constructed in the same manner as in classical mechanics. However, in classical mechanics, the Hamiltonian is a scalar-valued function, whereas in quantum mechanics, it is an operator on a space of functions. It is not surprising that the [[eigenvalues]] of <math>\\hat{H}</math> are the energy levels of the system.\n\n===Quantization===\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation predicts that if certain properties of a system are measured, the result may be ''quantized'', meaning that only specific discrete values can occur. One example is ''energy quantization'': the energy of an electron in an atom is always one of the [[Energy level|quantized energy levels]], a fact discovered via [[atomic spectroscopy]]. (Energy quantization is discussed [[#Time-independent|below]].) Another example is [[angular momentum operator|quantization of angular momentum]]. This was an ''assumption'' in the earlier [[Bohr model|Bohr model of the atom]], but it is a ''prediction'' of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\n\nAnother result of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is that not every measurement gives a quantized result in quantum mechanics. For example, position, momentum, time, and (in some situations) energy can have any value across a continuous range.<ref name=\"Zettili2009\">{{cite book|author=Nouredine Zettili|title=Quantum Mechanics: Concepts and Applications|date=17 February 2009|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-470-02678-6}}</ref>{{rp|165\u2013167}}\n\n===Quantum tunneling===\n{{main|Quantum tunneling}}\n[[File:TunnelEffektKling1.png|width = 300px|thumb|[[Quantum tunneling]] through a barrier. A particle coming from the left does not have enough energy to climb the barrier. However, it can sometimes \"tunnel\" to the other side. ]]\n\nIn classical physics, when a ball is rolled slowly up a large hill, it will come to a stop and roll back, because it doesn't have enough energy to get over the top of the hill to the other side. However, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation predicts that there is a small probability that the ball will get to the other side of the hill, even if it has too little energy to reach the top. This is called [[quantum tunneling]]. It is related to the distribution of energy: although the ball's assumed position seems to be on one side of the hill, there is a chance of finding it on the other side.\n\n===Particles as waves===\n{{main|Matter wave|Wave\u2013particle duality|Double-slit experiment}}\n\n[[File:Double-slit experiment results Tanamura 2.jpg|175px|thumb|A double slit experiment showing the accumulation of electrons on a screen as time passes.]]\n\nThe nonrelativistic Schr\u00f6dinger equation is a type of [[partial differential equation]] called a [[wave equation]]. Therefore, it is often said particles can exhibit behavior usually attributed to waves. In some modern interpretations this description is reversed \u2013 the quantum state, i.e. wave, is the only genuine physical reality, and under the appropriate conditions it can show features of particle-like behavior. However, Ballentine<ref name=Ballentine>{{citation|last=Ballentine|first=Leslie|title=Quantum Mechanics: A Modern Development | publisher=World Scientific Publishing Co.|year=1998| isbn = 978-9810241056}}</ref>{{rp|Chapter 4, p.99}} shows that such an interpretation has problems. Ballentine points out that whilst it is arguable to associate a physical wave with a single particle, there is still only ''one'' Schr\u00f6dinger wave equation for many particles. He points out:\n:''\"If a physical wave field were associated with a particle, or if a particle were identified with a wave packet, then corresponding to N interacting particles there should be N interacting waves in ordinary three-dimensional space. But according to (4.6) that is not the case; instead there is one \"wave\" function in an abstract 3N-dimensional configuration space. The misinterpretation of psi as a physical wave in ordinary space is possible only because the most common applications of quantum mechanics are to one-particle states, for which configuration space and ordinary space are isomorphic.\"''\n\n[[Double-slit experiment|Two-slit diffraction]] is a famous example of the strange behaviors that waves regularly display, that are not intuitively associated with particles. The overlapping waves from the two slits cancel each other out in some locations, and reinforce each other in other locations, causing a complex pattern to emerge. Intuitively, one would not expect this pattern from firing a single particle at the slits, because the particle should pass through one slit or the other, not a complex overlap of both.\n\nHowever, since the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is a [[wave equation]], a single particle fired through a double-slit ''does'' show this same pattern (figure on right). The experiment must be repeated many times for the complex pattern to emerge. Although this is counterintuitive, the prediction is correct; in particular, [[electron diffraction]] and [[neutron diffraction]] are well understood and widely used in science and engineering.\n\nRelated to [[diffraction]], particles also display [[Superposition principle#Application to waves|superposition]] and [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]].\n\nThe superposition property allows the particle to be in a [[quantum superposition]] of two or more quantum states at the same time. However, a \"quantum state\" in quantum mechanics means the ''probability'' that a system will be, for example at a position {{math|''x''}}, not that the system will actually be at position {{math|''x''}}. It does not imply that the particle itself may be in two classical states at once. Indeed, quantum mechanics is generally unable to assign values for properties prior to measurement at all.\n\n====Measurement and uncertainty====\n{{main|Measurement in quantum mechanics|Heisenberg uncertainty principle|Interpretations of quantum mechanics}}\nIn classical mechanics, a particle has, at every moment, an exact position and an exact momentum. These values change [[determinism|deterministically]] as the particle moves according to [[Newton's laws]]. Under the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics, particles do not have exactly determined properties, and when they are measured, the result is randomly drawn from a [[probability distribution]]. The Schr\u00f6dinger equation predicts what the probability distributions are, but fundamentally cannot predict the exact result of each measurement.\n\nThe [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] is one statement of the inherent measurement uncertainty in quantum mechanics. It states that the more precisely a particle's position is known, the less precisely its momentum is known, and vice versa.\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation describes the (deterministic) evolution of the [[wave function]] of a particle. However, even if the wave function is known exactly, the result of a specific measurement on the wave function is uncertain.\n\n==Interpretation of the wave function==\n{{main|Interpretations of quantum mechanics}}\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation provides a way to calculate the wave function of a system and how it changes dynamically in time. However, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation does not directly say ''what'', exactly, the wave function is. [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics]] address questions such as what the relation is between the wave function, the underlying reality, and the results of experimental measurements.\n\nAn important aspect is the relationship between the Schr\u00f6dinger equation and [[wave function collapse]]. In the oldest [[Copenhagen interpretation]], particles follow the Schr\u00f6dinger equation ''except'' during wave function collapse, during which they behave entirely differently. The advent of [[quantum decoherence|quantum decoherence theory]] allowed alternative approaches (such as the [[Everett many-worlds interpretation]] and [[consistent histories]]), wherein the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is ''always'' satisfied, and wave function collapse should be explained as a consequence of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\n\nIn 1952, [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]] gave a lecture during which he commented,\n:Nearly every result [a quantum theorist] pronounces is about the probability of this ''or'' that or that ... happening\u2014with usually a great many alternatives. The idea that they be not alternatives but ''all'' really happen simultaneously seems lunatic to him, just ''impossible.''<ref>{{cite book|last=Schr\u00f6dinger |first=Erwin |authorlink=Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger|title=The interpretation of quantum mechanics: Dublin seminars (1949\u20131955) and other unpublished essays |year=1995 |publisher=Ox Bow Press |isbn=9781881987086}}</ref>\n\n[[David Deutsch]] regarded this as the earliest known reference to a many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, an interpretation generally credited to [[Hugh Everett III]],<ref>David Deutsch, ''The Beginning of Infinity'', page 310</ref> while [[Jeffrey A.

Since energy and [[momentum]] are related in the same way as [[frequency]] and [[wavenumber|wave number]] in [[special relativity]], it followed that the momentum <math>p</math> of a photon is inversely proportional to its [[wavelength]] <math>\\lambda</math>, or proportional to its wave number <math>k</math>:\n\n:<math>p = \\frac{h}{\\lambda} = \\hbar k,</math>\n\nwhere <math>h</math> is [[Planck's constant]] and <math>\\hbar = {h}/{2\\pi}</math> is the reduced Planck constant (or the Dirac constant). [[Louis de Broglie]] hypothesized that this is true for all particles, even particles which have mass such as electrons.

A spike of heat will decay in amplitude and spread out; however, because the imaginary i is the generator of rotations in the complex plane, a spike in the amplitude of a matter wave will also rotate in the complex plane over time. The solutions are therefore functions which describe wave-like motions.

The basis for Schr\u00f6dinger's equation, on the other hand, is the energy of the system and a separate [[Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics#Postulates of quantum mechanics|postulate of quantum mechanics]]: the wave function is a description of the system.<ref name=\"Quantum Chemistry 1977\">''Molecular Quantum Mechanics Parts I and II: An Introduction to Quantum Chemistry'' (Volume 1), P.

However, there can be [[interactions#Physics|interactions]] between the particles (an [[many body problem|{{math|''N''}}-body problem]]), so the potential energy {{math|''V''}} can change as the spatial configuration of particles changes, and possibly with time. The potential energy, in general, is ''not'' the sum of the separate potential energies for each particle, it is a function of all the spatial positions of the particles. Explicitly:\n\n:<math>E=\\sum_{n=1}^N \\frac{\\mathbf{p}_n\\cdot\\mathbf{p}_n}{2m_n} + V(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\mathbf{r}_2,\\ldots,\\mathbf{r}_N,t) = H \\,\\!</math>\n\n=== Linearity ===\nThe simplest wave function is a [[plane wave]] of the form:\n\n:<math> \\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t) = A e^{i(\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}-\\omega t)}</math>\n\nwhere the {{math|''A''}} is the amplitude, {{math|'''k'''}} the wave vector, and <math>\\omega</math> the angular frequency, of the plane wave. In general, physical situations are not purely described by plane waves, so for generality the [[superposition principle]] is required; any wave can be made by superposition of sinusoidal plane waves. So if the equation is linear, a [[linear combination]] of plane waves is also an allowed solution. Hence a necessary and separate requirement is that the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is a [[linear differential equation]].\n\nFor discrete <math>\\mathbf{k}</math> the sum is a [[superposition principle#Application to waves|superposition]] of plane waves:\n\n:<math> \\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty A_n e^{i(\\mathbf{k}_n\\cdot\\mathbf{r}-\\omega_n t)} \\,\\!</math>\n\nfor some real amplitude coefficients <math>A_n</math>, and for continuous <math>\\mathbf{k}</math> the sum becomes an integral, the [[Fourier transform]] of a momentum space wave function:<ref name=\"Quantum Mechanics Demystified 2006\">''Quantum Mechanics Demystified'', D.

In practice, [[natural units]] comprising <math>\\hbar = 1</math> are used, as the De Broglie ''equations'' reduce to ''identities'': allowing momentum, wave number, energy and frequency to be used interchangeably, to prevent duplication of quantities, and reduce the number of dimensions of related quantities. For familiarity SI units are still used in this article.\n\nSchr\u00f6dinger's insight,{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} late in 1925, was to express the [[Phase (waves)|phase]] of a [[plane wave]] as a [[complex number|complex]] [[phase factor]] using these relations:\n\n:<math>\\Psi = Ae^{i(\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}-\\omega t)} = Ae^{i(\\mathbf{p}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}-Et)/\\hbar} </math>\n\nand to realize that the first order [[partial derivatives]] with respect to space were\n\n:<math> \\nabla\\Psi = \\dfrac{i}{\\hbar}\\mathbf{p}Ae^{i(\\mathbf{p}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}-Et)/\\hbar} = \\dfrac{i}{\\hbar}\\mathbf{p}\\Psi. </math>\n\nTaking partial derivatives with respect to time gives\n\n:<math> \\dfrac{\\partial \\Psi}{\\partial t} = -\\dfrac{i E}{\\hbar} Ae^{i(\\mathbf{p}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}-Et)/\\hbar} = -\\dfrac{i E}{\\hbar} \\Psi. </math>\n\nAnother postulate of quantum mechanics is that all observables are represented by [[linear operator|linear]] [[Self-adjoint operator|Hermitian operators]] which act on the wave function, and the eigenvalues of the operator are the values the observable takes. The previous derivatives are consistent with the [[energy operator]] (or Hamiltonian operator), corresponding to the time derivative,\n\n:<math>\\hat{E} \\Psi = i\\hbar\\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\Psi = E\\Psi  </math>\n\nwhere {{math|''E''}} are the energy [[eigenvalue]]s, and the [[momentum operator]], corresponding to the spatial derivatives (the [[del|gradient]] <math>\\nabla </math>),\n\n:<math>\\hat{\\mathbf{p}} \\Psi = -i\\hbar\\nabla \\Psi = \\mathbf{p} \\Psi </math>\n\nwhere {{math|'''p'''}} is a vector of the momentum eigenvalues. In the above, the \"[[circumflex|hats]]\" ( {{math|\u02c6}} ) indicate these observables are operators, not simply ordinary numbers or vectors. The energy and momentum operators are ''[[differential operators]]'', while the potential energy operator <math>V</math> is just a multiplicative factor.\n\nSubstituting the energy and momentum operators into the classical energy conservation equation obtains the operator:\n\n:<math>E= \\dfrac{\\mathbf{p}\\cdot\\mathbf{p}}{2m}+V \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad \\hat{E} = \\dfrac{\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}}{2m}  + V </math>\n\nso in terms of derivatives with respect to time and space, acting this operator on the wave function {{math|''\u03a8''}} immediately led Schr\u00f6dinger to his equation:{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n:<math>i\\hbar\\dfrac{\\partial \\Psi}{\\partial t}= -\\dfrac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\nabla^2\\Psi +V\\Psi</math>\n\nWave\u2013particle duality can be assessed from these equations as follows. The kinetic energy {{math|''T''}} is related to the square of momentum {{math|'''p'''}}. As the particle's momentum increases, the kinetic energy increases more rapidly, but since the wave number {{math|{{!}}'''k'''{{!}}}} increases the wavelength {{math|''\u03bb''}} decreases. In terms of ordinary scalar and vector quantities (not operators):\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{p}\\cdot\\mathbf{p} \\propto \\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{k} \\propto T \\propto \\dfrac{1}{\\lambda^2}</math>\n\nThe kinetic energy is also proportional to the second spatial derivatives, so it is also proportional to the magnitude of the ''[[curvature]]'' of the wave, in terms of operators:\n\n:<math> \\hat{T} \\Psi = \\frac{-\\hbar^2}{2m}\\nabla\\cdot\\nabla  \\Psi \\, \\propto \\, \\nabla^2 \\Psi \\,.</math>\n\nAs the curvature increases, the amplitude of the wave alternates between positive and negative more rapidly, and also shortens the wavelength. So the inverse relation between momentum and wavelength is consistent with the energy the particle has, and so the energy of the particle has a connection to a wave, all in the same mathematical formulation.<ref name=\"Quanta 1974\"/>\n\n===Wave and particle motion===\n {{multiple image\n   | align = right\n   | direction = horizontal\n   | image1    = Quantum mechanics travelling wavefunctions.svg\n   | caption1  = Increasing levels of [[wavepacket]] localization, meaning the particle has a more localized position.\n   | width1     = 400\n   | image2    = Perfect localization.svg\n   | caption2  = In the limit ''\u0127'' \u2192 0, the particle's position and momentum become known exactly.

Since, for a given spread in {{math|'''k'''}}, the spread in velocity is proportional to Planck's constant <math>\\hbar</math>, it is sometimes said that in the limit as <math>\\hbar</math> approaches zero, the equations of classical mechanics are restored from quantum mechanics.<ref name=\"Analytical Mechanics 2008\">''Analytical Mechanics'', L.

The quantum expectation values satisfy the [[Ehrenfest theorem]]. For a one-dimensional quantum particle moving in a potential <math>V</math>, the Ehrenfest theorem says<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Section 3.7.5</ref>\n:<math>m\\frac{d}{dt}\\langle x\\rangle = \\langle p\\rangle;\\quad \\frac{d}{dt}\\langle p\\rangle =  -\\left\\langle V'(X)\\right\\rangle .</math>\nAlthough the first of these equations is consistent with the classical behavior, the second is not: If the pair <math>(\\langle X\\rangle,\\langle P\\rangle)</math> were to satisfy Newton's second law, the right-hand side of the second equation would have to be\n:<math>-V'\\left(\\left\\langle X\\right\\rangle\\right)</math>,\nwhich is typically not the same as <math>-\\left\\langle V'(X)\\right\\rangle</math>. In the case of the quantum harmonic oscillator, however, <math>V'</math> is linear and this distinction disappears, so that in this very special case, the expected position and expected momentum do exactly follow the classical trajectories.\n\nFor general systems, the best we can hope for is that the expected position and momentum will ''approximately'' follow the classical trajectories. If the wave function is highly concentrated around a point <math>x_0</math>, then <math>V'\\left(\\left\\langle X\\right\\rangle\\right)</math> and <math>\\left\\langle V'(X)\\right\\rangle</math> will be ''almost'' the same, since both will be approximately equal to <math>V'(x_0)</math>. In that case, the expected position and expected momentum will remain very close to the classical trajectories, at least for as long as the wave function remains highly localized in position.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} p. 78</ref> When Planck's constant is small, it is possible to have a state that is well localized in ''both'' position and momentum. The small uncertainty in momentum ensures that the particle ''remains'' well localized in position for a long time, so that expected position and momentum continue to closely track the classical trajectories.\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation in its general form\n\n:<math> i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\Psi\\left(\\mathbf{r},t\\right) = \\hat{H} \\Psi\\left(\\mathbf{r},t\\right) \\,\\!</math>\n\nis closely related to the [[Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation]] (HJE)\n\n:<math> -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} S(q_i,t) = H\\left(q_i,\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial q_i},t \\right) \\,\\!</math>\n\nwhere <math>S</math> is the classical [[action (physics)|action]] and <math>H</math> is the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian function]] (not operator).

On the contrary, the Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation applies to a (classical) particle of definite position and momentum, instead the position and momentum at all times (the trajectory) are deterministic and can be simultaneously known.\n\n==Nonrelativistic quantum mechanics==\nThe quantum mechanics of particles without accounting for the effects of [[special relativity]], for example particles propagating at speeds much less than [[speed of light|light]], is known as '''nonrelativistic quantum mechanics'''. Following are several forms of Schr\u00f6dinger's equation in this context for different situations: time independence and dependence, one and three spatial dimensions, and one and {{math|''N''}} particles.\n\nIn actuality, the particles constituting the system do not have the numerical labels used in theory. The language of mathematics forces us to label the positions of particles one way or another, otherwise there would be confusion between symbols representing which variables are for which particle.<ref name=\"Atoms, Molecules 1985\">''Quantum Physics of Atoms, Molecules, Solids, Nuclei and Particles'' (2nd Edition), R.

In general, the wave function takes the form:\n\n:<math>\\Psi(\\text{space coords},t)=\\psi(\\text{space coords})\\tau(t)\\,.</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''\u03c8''(space coords)}} is a function of all the spatial coordinate(s) of the particle(s) constituting the system only, and {{math|''\u03c4''(''t'')}} is a function of time only.\n\nSubstituting for {{math|''&psi;''}} into the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the relevant number of particles in the relevant number of dimensions, solving by [[separation of variables]] implies the general solution of the time-dependent equation has the form:<ref name=\"verlagsgesellschaft1991\"/>\n\n:<math> \\Psi(\\text{space coords},t) = \\psi(\\text{space coords}) e^{-i{E t/\\hbar}} \\,.</math>\n\nSince the time dependent phase factor is always the same, only the spatial part needs to be solved for in time independent problems. Additionally, the energy operator {{math|''\u00ca'' {{=}} ''i\u0127''{{sfrac|\u2202|\u2202''t''}}}} can always be replaced by the energy eigenvalue {{math|''E''}}, thus the time independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation is an [[eigenvalue]] equation for the Hamiltonian operator:<ref name=Shankar1994/>{{rp|143ff}}\n:<math>\\hat{H} \\psi = E \\psi </math>\n\nThis is true for any number of particles in any number of dimensions (in a time independent potential). This case describes the [[standing wave]] solutions of the time-dependent equation, which are the states with definite energy (instead of a probability distribution of different energies). In physics, these standing waves are called \"[[stationary state]]s\" or \"[[energy eigenstate]]s\"; in chemistry they are called \"[[atomic orbital]]s\" or \"[[molecular orbital]]s\". Superpositions of energy eigenstates change their properties according to the relative phases between the energy levels.\n\nThe energy eigenvalues from this equation form a discrete [[Spectrum (functional analysis)|spectrum]] of values, so mathematically energy must be quantized. More specifically, the energy eigenstates form a basis \u2013 any wave function may be written as a sum over the discrete energy states or an integral over continuous energy states, or more generally as an integral over a measure.

If the potential {{math|''V''<sub>0</sub>}} grows to infinity, the motion is classically confined to a finite region.

Ultimately, these properties arise from the Hamiltonian used, and the solutions to the equation.\n\n===Linearity===\n{{See also|Linear differential equation}}\n\nIn the development above, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation was made to be linear for generality, though this has other implications. If two wave functions {{math|''\u03c8''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''\u03c8''<sub>2</sub>}} are solutions, then so is any [[linear combination]] of the two:\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle \\psi = a\\psi_1 + b \\psi_2 </math>\n\nwhere {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are any complex numbers (the sum can be extended for any number of wave functions). This property allows [[Quantum superposition|superpositions of quantum states]] to be solutions of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Even more generally, it holds that a general solution to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be found by taking a weighted sum over all single state solutions achievable. For example, consider a wave function {{math|''\u03a8''(''x'', ''t'')}} such that the wave function is a product of two functions: one time independent, and one time dependent. If states of definite energy found using the time independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation are given by {{math|''\u03c8<sub>E</sub>''(''x'')}} with amplitude {{math|''A<sub>n</sub>''}} and time dependent phase factor is given by\n\n:<math>e^{{-iE_n t}/\\hbar}, </math>\n\nthen a valid general solution is\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle \\Psi(x,t) = \\sum\\limits_{n} A_n \\psi_{E_n}(x) e^{{-iE_n t}/\\hbar}. </math>\n\nAdditionally, the ability to scale solutions allows one to solve for a wave function without normalizing it first. If one has a set of normalized solutions {{math|''\u03c8<sub>n</sub>''}}, then\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle \\Psi = \\sum\\limits_{n} A_n \\psi_n </math>\n\ncan be normalized by ensuring that\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle \\sum\\limits_{n}|A_n|^2 = 1. </math>\n\nThis is much more convenient than having to verify that\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle \\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}|\\Psi(x)|^2\\,dx = \\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\Psi(x)\\Psi^{*}(x)\\,dx = 1. </math>\n\n=== Momentum space Schr\u00f6dinger equation ===\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation <math>i\\hbar \\partial_t |\\psi\\rangle = \\hat{H}|\\psi \\rangle </math> is often presented in the position basis form <math>i\\hbar \\partial_t \\psi(x) = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\nabla^2\\psi(x) + V(x)\\psi(x) </math> (with <math>\\langle x |\\psi\\rangle \\equiv \\psi(x) </math>). But as a vector operator equation it has a valid representation in any arbitrary complete basis of kets in [[Hilbert space]]. For example, in the momentum space basis the equation reads\n\n<math>\\displaystyle i\\hbar \\partial_t f(p) = \\frac{p^2}{2m}f(p) + (\\tilde{V}*f) (p) </math>\n\nwhere <math>|p\\rangle </math> is the plane wave state of definite momentum <math>p </math>, <math>\\langle p |\\psi\\rangle \\equiv f(p) = \\int \\psi(x)e^{-ipx}dx </math>, <math>\\tilde{V} </math> is the Fourier transform of <math>V </math>, and <math>* </math> denotes [[Convolution theorem|Fourier convolution]].\n\nIn the 1D example with absence of a potential, <math>\\tilde V = 0 </math> (or similarly <math>\\tilde V(k) \\propto \\delta(k) </math> in the case of a background potential constant throughout space), each stationary state of energy <math> \\hbar \\omega = q^2/2m </math> is of the form\n\n<math> f_q(p) = (c_{+}\\delta(p-q)+c_{-}\\delta(p+q))e^{-i\\omega t} </math>\n\nfor arbitrary complex coefficients <math> c_{\\pm} </math>. Such a wave function, as expected in free space, is a superposition of plane waves moving right and left with momenta <math> \\pm q </math>; upon momentum measurement the state would collapse to one of definite momentum <math> \\pm q </math> with probability <math> \\propto |c_{\\pm}|^2 </math>.\n\nA version of the momentum space Schr\u00f6dinger equation is often used in [[solid-state physics]], as [[Bloch's Theorem|Bloch's theorem]] ensures the periodic crystal lattice potential couples <math>f(p) </math> with <math>f(p+K) </math> for only discrete [[reciprocal lattice]] vectors <math>K </math>. This makes it convenient to solve the momentum space Schr\u00f6dinger equation at each [[Crystal momentum|point]] in the [[Brillouin zone]] independently of the other points in the Brillouin zone.\n\n=== Real energy eigenstates ===\nFor the time-independent equation, an additional feature of linearity follows: if two wave functions {{math|''\u03c8''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''&psi;''<sub>2</sub>}} are solutions to the time-independent equation with the same energy {{math|''E''}}, then so is any linear combination:\n\n:<math> \\hat H (a\\psi_1 + b \\psi_2 ) = a \\hat H \\psi_1 + b \\hat H \\psi_2 = E (a \\psi_1 + b\\psi_2). </math>\n\nTwo different solutions with the same energy are called ''degenerate''.<ref name=\"Quantum Mechanics Demystified 2006\"/>\n\nIn an arbitrary potential, if a wave function {{math|''\u03c8''}} solves the time-independent equation, so does its [[complex conjugate]], denoted {{math|''\u03c8''*}}. By taking linear combinations, the real and imaginary parts of {{math|''\u03c8''}} are each solutions. If there is no degeneracy they can only differ by a factor.\n\nIn the time-dependent equation, complex conjugate waves move in opposite directions. If {{math|''\u03a8''(''x'', ''t'')}} is one solution, then so is {{math|''\u03a8''*(''x'', \u2013''t'')}}. The symmetry of complex conjugation is called [[T-symmetry|time-reversal symmetry]].\n\n===Space and time derivatives===\n[[File:Wavefunction continuity space.svg|250px|thumb|Continuity of the wave function and its first spatial derivative (in the {{math|''x''}} direction, {{math|''y''}} and {{math|''z''}} coordinates not shown), at some time {{math|''t''}}.]]\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation is first order in time and second in space, which describes the time evolution of a quantum state (meaning it determines the future amplitude from the present).\n\nExplicitly for one particle in 3-dimensional Cartesian coordinates \u2013 the equation is\n\n:<math>i\\hbar{\\partial \\Psi \\over \\partial t} = - {\\hbar^2\\over 2m} \\left ( {\\partial^2 \\Psi \\over \\partial x^2} + {\\partial^2 \\Psi \\over \\partial y^2} + {\\partial^2 \\Psi \\over \\partial z^2} \\right ) + V(x,y,z,t)\\Psi.\\,\\!</math>\n\nThe first time partial derivative implies the initial value (at {{math|''t'' {{=}} 0}}) of the wave function\n\n:<math> \\Psi(x,y,z,0) \\,\\!</math>\n\nis an arbitrary constant. Likewise \u2013 the second order derivatives with respect to space implies the wave function ''and'' its first order spatial derivatives\n\n:<math> \\begin{align} \n& \\Psi(x_b,y_b,z_b,t) \\\\\n& \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\Psi(x_b,y_b,z_b,t) \\quad \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\Psi(x_b,y_b,z_b,t) \\quad \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\Psi(x_b,y_b,z_b,t) \n\\end{align} \\,\\!</math>\n\nare all arbitrary constants at a given set of points, where {{math|''x<sub>b</sub>''}}, {{math|''y<sub>b</sub>''}}, {{math|''z<sub>b</sub>''}} are a set of points describing boundary {{math|''b''}} (derivatives are evaluated at the boundaries). Typically there are one or two boundaries, such as the [[step potential]] and [[particle in a box]] respectively.\n\nAs the first order derivatives are arbitrary, the wave function can be a [[smooth function|continuously differentiable function]] of space, since at any boundary the gradient of the wave function can be matched.\n\nOn the contrary, wave equations in physics are usually ''second order in time'', notable are the family of classical [[wave equation]]s and the quantum [[Klein\u2013Gordon equation]].\n\n=== Local conservation of probability ===\n{{Main|Probability current|Continuity equation}}\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation is consistent with [[conservation of probability|probability conservation]]. Multiplying the Schr\u00f6dinger equation on the right by the complex conjugate wave function, and multiplying the wave function to the left of the complex conjugate of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, and subtracting, gives the [[Continuity equation#Quantum mechanics|continuity equation]] for probability:<ref name=\"Quantum Mechanics 2004\">''Quantum Mechanics'', E. Abers, Pearson Ed., Addison Wesley, Prentice Hall Inc, 2004, {{isbn|978-0-13-146100-0}}</ref>\n:<math>{ \\partial \\over \\partial t} \\rho\\left(\\mathbf{r},t\\right) + \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{j} = 0, </math>\nwhere \n:<math>\\rho=|\\Psi|^2=\\Psi^*(\\mathbf{r},t)\\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t)\\,\\!</math>\nis the [[probability density function|probability density]] (probability per unit volume, {{math|*}} denotes [[complex conjugate]]), and\n:<math> \\mathbf{j} = {1 \\over 2m} \\left( \\Psi^*\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}\\Psi  - \\Psi\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}\\Psi^* \\right)\\,\\!</math>\nis the [[probability current]] (flow per unit area).\n\nHence predictions from the Schr\u00f6dinger equation do not violate probability conservation.\n\n=== Positive energy ===\nIf the potential is bounded from below, meaning there is a minimum value of potential energy, the eigenfunctions of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation have energy which is also bounded from below. This can be seen most easily by using the [[variational principle]], as follows. (See also below).\n\nFor any linear operator {{math|''\u00c2''}} [[Bounded operator|bounded]] from below, the eigenvector with the smallest eigenvalue is the vector {{math|''\u03c8''}} that minimizes the quantity\n\n:<math> \\langle \\psi |\\hat{A}|\\psi \\rangle </math>\n\nover all {{math|''\u03c8''}} which are [[normalizable wave function|normalized]].<ref name=\"Quantum Mechanics 2004\"/> In this way, the smallest eigenvalue is expressed through the [[variational principle]]. For the Schr\u00f6dinger Hamiltonian {{math|''\u0124''}} bounded from below, the smallest eigenvalue is called the ground state energy. That energy is the minimum value of\n\n:<math>\\langle \\psi|\\hat{H}|\\psi\\rangle = \\int \\psi^*(\\mathbf{r}) \\left[ - \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\nabla^2\\psi(\\mathbf{r}) + V(\\mathbf{r})\\psi(\\mathbf{r})\\right] d^3\\mathbf{r} = \\int \\left[ \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}|\\nabla\\psi|^2 + V(\\mathbf{r}) |\\psi|^2 \\right] d^3\\mathbf{r} = \\langle \\hat{H}\\rangle </math>\n\n(using [[integration by parts]]). Due to the [[Absolute value#Complex numbers|complex modulus]] of {{math|''\u03c8''<sup>2</sup>}} (which is positive definite), the right hand side is always greater than the lowest value of {{math|''V''(''x'')}}. In particular, the ground state energy is positive when {{math|''V''(''x'')}} is everywhere positive.\n\nFor potentials which are bounded below and are not infinite over a region, there is a ground state which minimizes the integral above. This lowest energy wave function is real and positive definite \u2013 meaning the wave function can increase and decrease, but is positive for all positions. It physically cannot be negative: if it were, smoothing out the bends at the sign change (to minimize the wave function) rapidly reduces the gradient contribution to the integral and hence the kinetic energy, while the potential energy changes linearly and less quickly. The kinetic and potential energy are both changing at different rates, so the total energy is not constant, which can't happen (conservation). The solutions are consistent with Schr\u00f6dinger equation if this wave function is positive definite.\n\nThe lack of sign changes also shows that the ground state is nondegenerate, since if there were two ground states with common energy {{math|''E''}}, not proportional to each other, there would be a linear combination of the two that would also be a ground state resulting in a zero solution.\n\n===Analytic continuation to diffusion===\n{{see also|path integral formulation#The Schr\u00f6dinger equation|label 1=Path integral formulation (The Schr\u00f6dinger equation)}}\n\nThe above properties (positive definiteness of energy) allow the [[analytic continuation]] of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation to be identified as a [[stochastic process]]. This can be interpreted as the [[Huygens\u2013Fresnel principle]] applied to De Broglie waves; the spreading wavefronts are diffusive probability amplitudes.<ref name=\"Quantum Mechanics 2004\"/> \nFor a free particle (not subject to a potential) in a [[random walk]], substituting {{math|''\u03c4'' {{=}} ''it''}} into the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation gives:<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.82.011132 |pmid=20866590|url=http://www.stt.msu.edu/~mcubed/Relativistic.pdf|title=Stochastic models for relativistic diffusion|journal=Physical Review E|volume=82|issue=1 Pt 1|pages=011132|year=2010|last1=Baeumer|first1=Boris|last2=Meerschaert|first2=Mark M.|last3=Naber|first3=Mark|bibcode=2010PhRvE..82a1132B}}</ref>\n\n:<math> {\\partial \\over \\partial \\tau} X(\\mathbf{r},\\tau) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2m} \\nabla ^2 X(\\mathbf{r},\\tau) \\, , \\quad X(\\mathbf{r},\\tau) = \\Psi(\\mathbf{r},\\tau/i)</math>\n\nwhich has the same form as the [[diffusion equation]], with diffusion coefficient {{math|{{sfrac|''\u0127''|2''m''}}}}.\n\n===Regularity===\nOn the space <math>L^2</math> of square-integrable densities, the Schr\u00f6dinger semigroup <math>e^{it\\hat{H}}</math> is a unitary evolution, and therefore surjective. The flows satisfy the Schr\u00f6dinger equation <math>i\\partial_t u = \\hat{H}u</math>, where the derivative is taken in the [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] sense. However, since <math>\\hat{H}</math> for most physically reasonable Hamiltonians (e.g., the [[Laplace operator]], possibly modified by a potential) is unbounded in <math>L^2</math>, this shows that the semigroup flows lack Sobolev regularity in general. Instead, solutions of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation satisfy a [[Strichartz estimate]].\n\n==Relativistic quantum mechanics==\n[[Relativistic quantum mechanics]] is obtained where quantum mechanics and [[special relativity]] simultaneously apply. In general, one wishes to build [[relativistic wave equations]] from the relativistic [[energy\u2013momentum relation]]\n\n:<math>E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2 \\, , </math>\n\ninstead of classical energy equations. The [[Klein\u2013Gordon equation]] and the [[Dirac equation]] are two such equations. The Klein\u2013Gordon equation,\n\n:<math> \\frac {1}{c^2} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial t^2} \\psi - \\nabla^2 \\psi + \\frac {m^2 c^2}{\\hbar^2} \\psi = 0. </math>,\n\nwas the first such equation to be obtained, even before the nonrelativistic one, and applies to massive spinless particles. The Dirac equation arose from taking the \"square root\" of the Klein\u2013Gordon equation by factorizing the entire relativistic wave operator into a product of two operators \u2013 one of these is the operator for the entire Dirac equation. Entire Dirac equation:\n:<math>\\left(\\beta mc^2 + c\\left(\\sum_{n \\mathop =1}^{3}\\alpha_n p_n\\right)\\right) \\psi = i \\hbar \\frac{\\partial\\psi }{\\partial t} </math>\n\nThe general form of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation remains true in relativity, but the Hamiltonian is less obvious. For example, the Dirac Hamiltonian for a particle of mass {{math|''m''}} and electric charge {{math|''q''}} in an electromagnetic field (described by the [[electromagnetic potential]]s {{math|''\u03c6''}} and {{math|'''A'''}}) is:\n\n:<math>\\hat{H}_{\\text{Dirac}}= \\gamma^0 \\left[c  \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}\\cdot\\left(\\hat{\\mathbf{p}} - q \\mathbf{A}\\right) + mc^2 + \\gamma^0q \\varphi \\right]\\,, </math>\n\nin which the {{math|'''\u03b3''' {{=}} (''\u03b3''<sup>1</sup>, ''\u03b3''<sup>2</sup>, ''\u03b3''<sup>3</sup>)}} and {{math|''\u03b3''<sup>0</sup>}} are the Dirac [[gamma matrices]] related to the spin of the particle. The Dirac equation is true for all {{nobreak|[[spin-1/2|spin-{{frac|2}}]]}} particles, and the solutions to the equation are {{nobreak|4-component}} [[spinor field]]s with two components corresponding to the particle and the other two for the [[antiparticle]].\n\nFor the Klein\u2013Gordon equation, the general form of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is inconvenient to use, and in practice the Hamiltonian is not expressed in an analogous way to the Dirac Hamiltonian. The equations for relativistic quantum fields can be obtained in other ways, such as starting from a [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian density]] and using the [[Euler\u2013Lagrange equation]]s for fields, or use the [[representation theory of the Lorentz group]] in which certain representations can be used to fix the equation for a free particle of given spin (and mass).\n\nIn general, the Hamiltonian to be substituted in the general Schr\u00f6dinger equation is not just a function of the position and momentum operators (and possibly time), but also of spin matrices. Also, the solutions to a relativistic wave equation, for a massive particle of spin {{math|''s''}}, are complex-valued {{nobreak|{{math|2(2''s'' + 1)}}-component}} [[spinor field]]s.\n\n==Quantum field theory==\nThe general equation is also valid and used in [[quantum field theory]], both in relativistic and nonrelativistic situations. However, the solution {{math|''\u03c8''}} is no longer interpreted as a \"wave\", but should be interpreted as an operator acting on states existing in a [[Fock space]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n==First order form==\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation can also be derived from a first order form<ref  name=\"one\">{{cite journal|last1=Ajaib|first1=Muhammad Adeel|title=A Fundamental Form of the Schr\u00f6dinger Equation|journal=Found.

Henry McGhee, described as the \"primary architect of competitive female bodybuilding\", was an employee of the Downtown [[Canton, Ohio|Canton]] [[YMCA]], carried a strong belief that women should share the opportunity to display their physiques and the results of their weight training the way men had done for years. The first official female bodybuilding competition was held in Canton, Ohio, in November 1977 and was called the Ohio Regional Women's Physique Championship. It was judged strictly as a bodybuilding contest and was the first event of its kind for women. Gina LaSpina, the champion, is considered the first recognized winner of a woman's bodybuilding contest. The event organizer, McGhee, told the competitors that they would be judged \"like the men,\" with emphasis on muscular development, symmetry, and physique presentation. In 1978, McGhee organized the first National Women's Physique Championship, along with the short-lived United States Women's Physique Association (USWPA), which he formed to help organize women interested in competing in bodybuilding. The USWPA became defunct in 1980.<ref name=\"The History & Evolution of Women's Bodybuilding\" /><ref name=\"Women of Steel\" />\n\nOn August 18, 1979, promoter George Snyder organized a \"female bodybuilding\" contest known as The Best in the World contest, which was the first IFBB-sanctioned event for women that awarded prize money to the top finishers, with the winner receiving $2,500. It was considered the forerunner for the [[Ms. Olympia]] competition. Although sanctioned as a bodybuilding contest, women were required to appear on stage in high heels. Doris Barrilleaux found the Superior Physique Association (SPA) in 1978, the first women's bodybuilding organization run for women and by women. She also began publishing the SPA News, a newsletter dedicated exclusively to female bodybuilding. SPA disseminated information to women about contests and proper training and dieting. On April 29, 1979, SPA held Florida's first official women's contest in which thirteen women competed. The contest was held in Brandon Florida and promoted by Megas Gym and Doris Barrilleaux. The winner of the show was [[Laura Combes]]. Also in 1979, the IFBB formed the IFBB Women's Committee; Christine Zane was appointed the first chairperson to serve as head of the newly formed committee. One of the significant differences between the SPA and the IFBB was that while the IFBB was organized and run by men, the SPA was run by women and for women.<ref name=\"Women of Steel\" />\n\nMore contests started to appear in 1979. Some of these were the following:\n\n*The second U.S. Women's National Physique Championship, won by [[Kay Baxter]], with Marilyn Schriner second and [[Cammie Lusko]] third.\n*The first [[International Federation of BodyBuilders|IFBB]] Women's World Body Building Championship, held on June 16, won by [[Lisa Lyon]], followed by [[Claudia Wilbourn]], Stella Martinez, [[Stacey Bentley]], and Bette Brown.\n*The Best In The World contest, held at [[Warminster, PA]] on August 18, featuring a $5,000 prize fund, with $2,500 awarded for first place. Patsy Chapman was the winner, followed by April Nicotra, Bentley, Brown, and [[Carla Dunlap-Kaan|Carla Dunlap]]. (Levin, 1980)\n*The [[Robby Robinson (bodybuilder)|Robby Robinson]] Classic, held at the Embassy Auditorium in [[Los Angeles]] on August 25. Bentley finished first, also winning best legs and best poser, followed by Brown, Lusko, and [[Georgia Fudge|Georgia Miller]]. (Roark, 2005)\n\nAlthough these early events were regarded as bodybuilding contests, the women wore [[high-heeled shoe]]s, and did not clench their fists while posing. Additionally, they were not allowed to use the three so-called \"men's poses\" &mdash; the double biceps, crab, and lat spread. The contests were generally held by promoters acting independently; the sport still lacked a governing body. That would change in 1980.\n\n===1980&nbsp;\u2013 1989===\n\nThe 1980s is when female bodybuilding first took off. The early 1980s signified a transition from the fashionably thin \"twiggy\" body to one carrying slightly more muscle mass.<ref name=\"Strong and Hard Women\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Csck0Sst-QkC&pg=PA29&lpg=PA29&dq|title=Strong and Hard Women: An ethnography of female bodybuilding|first=Tanya|last=Bunsell|date=12 April 2013|publisher=Routledge|accessdate=26 August 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=9781136250866}}</ref> The [[National Physique Committee]] (NPC) held the first women's Nationals in 1980. Since its inception, this has been the top amateur level competition for women in the US. [[Laura Combes]] won the inaugural contest. The first World Couples Championship was held in [[Atlantic City]] on April 8. The winning couple was [[Stacey Bentley]] and [[Chris Dickerson (bodybuilder)|Chris Dickerson]], with April Nicotra and Robby Robinson in second. Bentley picked up her third consecutive victory in the [[Frank Zane]] Invitational on June 28, ahead of [[Rachel McLish]], [[Lynn Conkwright]], Suzy Green, [[Patsy Chapman]], and [[Georgia Fudge|Georgia Miller Fudge]].\n\nIn 1980, the first [[Ms. Olympia]] (initially known as the \"Miss\" Olympia), the most prestigious contest for professional female bodybuilders, was held. Initially, the contest was promoted by George Snyder. The contestants had to send in resumes and pictures, and were hand-picked by Snyder based on their potential to be fitness role models for the average American woman. The first winner was [[Rachel McLish]], who had also won the NPC's USA Championship earlier in the year. The contest was a major turning point for the sport of women's bodybuilding. McLish turned out to be very promotable, and inspired many future competitors to start training and competing. Stacey Bentley finished in fifth place, in what turned out to be her final competition. Also in 1980, the [[American Federation of Women Bodybuilders]] was also founded, representing a growing awareness of women bodybuilders in America. Winning competitors such as Laurie Stark (Ms. Southern States, 1988) helped to popularize the federation.<ref name=\"Strong and Hard Women\" /><ref name=\"Women of Steel\" />\n\nRachel McLish became the most successful competitor of the early 1980s. She lost her Ms. Olympia crown by finishing second to [[Ritva Elomaa|Kike Elomaa]] in 1981, but regained the title in 1982. A new major pro contest, the Women's Pro World Championship, was held for the first time in 1981 (won by Lynn Conkwright). Held annually through 1989, this was the second most prestigious contest of the time. McLish added this title to her collection in 1982. George Snyder lost the rights to the Ms. Olympia in 1982, and after this the contestants were no longer hand-picked, but instead qualified for the Ms. Olympia through placings in lesser contests. Women's bodybuilding was officially recognized as a sport discipline by the 1982 IFBB Congress in [[Brugge, Belgium]].<ref name=\"IFBBrulebook\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ifbb.com/pdf/IFBBrulebook.pdf|title=IFBBrulebook|website=Ifbb.com|access-date=February 11, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130813235557/http://www.ifbb.com/pdf/IFBBrulebook.pdf|archive-date=August 13, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAs the sport grew, the competitors' level of training gradually increased as did the use of anabolic steroids (most of the competitors in the earliest shows had very little weight training experience or steroid usage), and the sport slowly evolved towards more muscular physiques. This trend started to emerge in 1983. With McLish not competing in the big shows, [[Carla Dunlap-Kaan|Carla Dunlap]] took both the Pro World and Ms. Olympia titles. Dunlap possessed a more muscular physique than either McLish or Elomaa, and though she never repeated her successes of 1983, she would remain competitive for the rest of the decade.\n\nIn 1984, a new force emerged in women's bodybuilding. [[Corinna Everson|Cory Everson]] won the NPC Nationals, then defeated McLish to win the Ms. Olympia. At 5'9\" and 150 pounds, Everson's physique set a new standard. She would go on to win six consecutive Ms. Olympia titles from 1984 to 1989 before retiring undefeated as a professional, the only female bodybuilder ever to accomplish this.\n\nDuring this period, women's bodybuilding was starting to achieve some serious mainstream exposure. Pro competitor Anita Gandol created a stir by posing for ''[[Playboy]]'' in 1984, earning a one-year suspension from the [[International Federation of BodyBuilders|IFBB]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Erika Mes, a Dutch competitor, posed nude for the [[Belgium|Belgian]] issue of ''Playboy'' in September 1987, also earning a one-year suspension.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Lori Bowen, winner of the 1984 Pro World Championship, appeared in a widely broadcast commercial for [[Miller Lite]] beer with [[Rodney Dangerfield]]. Additionally, competitors Lynn Conkwright (1982) and Carla Dunlap (1984) were included in [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Superstars]]'' competition.\n\nIn 1985, a movie called ''[[Pumping Iron II: The Women]]'' was released. This film documented the preparation of several women for the 1983 [[Caesars Palace]] World Cup Championship. Competitors prominently featured in the film were Kris Alexander, Lori Bowen, Lydia Cheng, [[Carla Dunlap-Kaan|Carla Dunlap]], [[Bev Francis]], and [[Rachel McLish]]. At the time, Francis was actually a [[powerlifting|powerlifter]], though she soon made a successful transition to bodybuilding, becoming one of the leading competitors of the late 1980s and early 1990s. The main theme of the movie pitted the sultry and curvaceous Rachel McLish, the current champion; against the super-muscular Bev Francis. This \"rivalry\" brought to light the true dilemma of Women's Bodybuilding and exposed the root of all the controversy (aesthetics vs size) which was the focal point at that time and which still continues today. In 1985, the National Women's and Mixed Pairs Bodybuilding Championships were held in Detroit, Michigan by promoter/bodybuilder Gema Wheeler (Long). It was the first amateur bodybuilding event televised internationally by ESPN Sports.\n\nFor several years in the mid-1980s, [[NBC]] broadcast coverage of the Ms. Olympia contest on their ''Sportsworld'' program.  The taped footage was telecast months after the contest, and was usually used as secondary material to fill out programs featuring events such as boxing.  Typically, the broadcasts included only the top several women. Nevertheless, Rachel McLish and some of her leading competitors were receiving national TV coverage. McLish authored two New York Times best-selling books - \"Flex Appeal\" (1984) and \"Perfect Parts\" (1987) \u2013 and was also starring in action films. The popularity was growing and women were being empowered and inspired to train. In 1983, the top prize money for the women bodybuilding was $50,000, equal to that of male bodybuilding.\n\nThe [[Ms. International]] contest was introduced in 1986, first won by [[Erika Geisen]]. In 1987 the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] (AAU), who were sanctioning amateur bodybuilding at the time, positioned the International as a premiere amateur event. It was held in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The AAU brought [[Serge Nubret]] (a former Mr. World, Mr. Universe and Mr. Europe) from France to be the featured guest poser. Since 1988, the competition has been sanctioned by the IFBB. Since the demise of the Pro World Championship after 1989, the Ms. International has been second in prestige only to the Ms. Olympia. The 1989 Ms. International was noteworthy for the fact that the original winner, [[Tonya Knight]], was later disqualified for using a surrogate for her drug test at the 1988 Ms. Olympia contest. Consequently, runner-up [[Jackie Paisley]] received the 1989 title. Knight was suspended from [[International Federation of BodyBuilders|IFBB]] competition through the end of 1990, and was forced to return her prize money from the 1988 Ms. Olympia and 1989 Ms. International, a total of $12,000 (Merritt, 2006).\n\n===1990&nbsp;\u2013 1999===\n\nNormally, competitors must qualify for the Ms. Olympia by achieving certain placings in lesser pro contests.  However, the cancellation of the Women's Pro World contest in 1990 left only the Ms. International as a Ms. Olympia qualifier.  Consequently, the IFBB decided to open the Ms. Olympia to all women with pro cards, and a field of thirty competitors entered.  [[Lenda Murray]], a new pro from Michigan, earned a decisive victory and emerged as the successor to Cory Everson.  Murray became the next dominant figure in the sport.\n\nA new professional contest, the Jan Tana Classic, was introduced in 1991. The contest was named for its promoter, a marketer of tanning products, and ran annually until 2003 with the departure of Wayne Demilia (it was later briefly revived in 2007). The inaugural event was won by [[Sue Gafner]]. The Jan Tana filled the void left by the Women's Pro World contest, and occupied the number three slot on the pro circuit throughout its lifetime. 1991 also saw Tonya Knight return to competition, winning the Ms. International.\n\nThe 1991 Ms. Olympia contest was the first to be televised live. Lenda Murray faced a serious challenge from the 1990 runner-up, Bev Francis. Francis had started bodybuilding in the mid-1980s, converting over from powerlifting. Over the years, she had gradually refined her physique to be more in line with judging standards. However, she came to the 1991 contest noticeably larger than in previous years. Francis was leading going into the night show, with Murray needing all of the first place votes to retain her title. Murray managed to do just that, winning a somewhat controversial decision by one point.\n\nIn 1992, there was more controversy, this time at the 1992 Ms. International contest. In response to the increased size displayed by Murray and Francis at the previous Ms. Olympia, along with increasing drug abuse and androgenic side effects, the IFBB made an attempt to \"feminize\" the sport. The IFBB, led by [[Ben Weider]], had created a series of \"femininity\" rules; one line in the judging rules said that competitors should not be \"too big.\" Since extreme size generally requires extreme AAS usage, with more women gaining more androgenic (masculine) side effects, this was clearly an attempt to retain a higher level of female aesthetics and maintain the standard.  The judges\u2019 guide to the competitors stated that they were looking for a highly feminine and optimally developed, but not emaciated physique. The contest winner was Germany's [[Anja Schreiner]], a blue-eyed blonde with a symmetrical physique who weighed 130 pounds at 5'7\". The announcement of her victory met with so much booing from those who prefer size over aesthetics that [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] had to step on stage to address the audience, saying \"the hell with the judges\". Many observers felt that the IFBB had instructed the judges to select the most marketable aesthetic physique, not the most muscular.\n\nThe 1992 Ms. International is also famous for an incident involving British competitor Paula Bircumshaw. Bircumshaw was the same height as Schreiner and possessed a similar level of symmetry and definition, but carried significantly more muscle, weighing in at 162 pounds. She was the clear audience favorite, but was relegated to eighth place. Normally, the top ten contestants are called out at the end of the show when the winners are announced, but the judges only called back the top six, hoping to keep Bircumshaw back stage. This resulted in an uproar from the crowd. With the audience chanting her name, Bircumshaw returned to the stage along with the top six competitors.\n\nAdvertising in ''[[Muscle & Fitness]]'' for the 1992 Ms. Olympia featured Schreiner prominently, relegating two-time defending champion Murray to a small \"also competing\" notice. Nevertheless, Murray also apparently met the \"femininity\" requirements, and managed to retain her title; Schreiner finished sixth, and promptly retired from competition.\n\nFollowing the 1992 debacles, the judging rules were rewritten. The new rules retained provisions for aesthetics, but allowed the contests to be judged as physique contests. Lenda Murray continued to dominate the sport from 1990 to 1995, matching Cory Everson's record of six consecutive Ms. Olympia titles. Murray's closest rival was probably [[Laura Creavalle]], who won the Ms. International title three times, and twice was runner-up to Murray at the Olympia.  During this time, some additional professional shows were held, in addition to the three mainstays. The 1994 schedule included the Canada Pro Cup, won by [[Laura Binetti]], and the first of three annual Grand Prix events in [[Prague]], won by Drorit Kernes. In 1996, the Grand Prix in [[Slovakia]] was added. Besides providing the competitors with extra opportunities to win prize money, these contests also served as additional Ms. Olympia qualifiers.\n\nThe mid-1990s of bodybuilding was known as the \"[[Dorian Yates|Dorian]] Era\", AKA the \"drug years\". In 1996, [[Kim Chizevsky-Nicholls]] would win the Ms. Intentional and dethroned the Ms. International champion, [[Laura Creavalle]]. Also in 1996, she would unseat six-time defending champion, [[Lenda Murray]]. This was the first time a pro female bodybuilder would win both the Ms. International and Ms. Olympia in the same year. She would retain her Ms. Olympia title in 1997 against Lenda Murray, who retired afterwards. At the 1997 Ms. Olympia, she competed at {{convert|157|lb}}. In 1998, she again won the Ms. Olympia title. The 1998 contest was held in [[Prague, Czech Republic]], the first time the competition had been held outside the [[United States]].\n\nAt the 1998 EFBB British Championships, Joanna Thomas won the lightweight and overall title, becoming the youngest woman in the world to ever to win an IFBB pro card at the age of 21.<ref name=\"Destiny\u2019s Child\">{{cite web|url=http://joannathomas.com/about.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030206203941/http://joannathomas.com/about.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 February 2003|title=Joanna Thomas - 2001 Jan Tana Winner|date=6 February 2003|access-date=26 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe 1999 Ms. Olympia was originally scheduled to be held on October 9 in [[Santa Monica, California]]. However, one month before the scheduled date, the IFBB announced that the contest had been cancelled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billdobbins.com/PUBLIC/art/freecoolart/Olyfax02.jpg|title=International Federation of Body-builders|website=Billdobbins.com|accessdate=26 August 2018}}</ref>  The main cause was the withdrawal of promoter Jarka Kastnerova (who promoted the 1998 contest in Prague) for financial reasons, including a low number of advance ticket sales for the 1999 event.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billdobbins.com/PUBLIC/art/freecoolart/Olyfax01.jpg|format=JPG|title=Photographic image of letter|website=Billdobbins.com|accessdate=26 August 2018}}</ref> The backlash following the announcement led to a flurry of activity, with the contest being rescheduled as part of the Women's Extravaganza (promoted by Kenny Kassel and Bob Bonham) in [[Secaucus, New Jersey]] on October 2.  Last minute sponsorship came from several sources, most significantly in the form of $50,000 from ''[[Flex (magazine)|Flex]]'' magazine. Amid all the turmoil, Kim Chizevsky-Nicholls won her fourth consecutive title. Chizevsky-Nicholls decided to retire from bodybuilding after winning the 1999 Ms. Olympia. According to [[Bill Dobbins]], she retired due to gender discrimination guidelines set up by the IFBB that advocated for more \"femininity\" and less \"muscularity\" in the sport.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billdobbins.com/PUBLIC/pages/coolfree/Kimbest.html |title=KIM CHIZEVSKY: THE BEST FEMALE BODYBUILDER OF ALL TIME? |publisher=Bill Dobbins Photography }}</ref>\n\n===2000&nbsp;\u2013 2010===\n\nThe IFBB introduced several changes to Ms. Olympia in 2000. The first change was that Ms. Olympia contest would no longer be held as a separate contest, instead became part of the \"Olympia Weekend\" in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] and held the day before the men's show. The second change was when heavyweight and lightweight classes where added. The third change was the new judging guidelines for presentations were introduced. A letter to the competitors from Jim Manion (chairman of the Professional Judges Committee) stated that women would be judged on healthy appearance, face, makeup, and skin tone. The criteria given in Manion's letter included the statement \"symmetry, presentation, separations, and muscularity BUT NOT TO THE EXTREME!\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billdobbins.com/PUBLIC/art/miscart/criteria.jpg|title=Photographic image of letter|website=Billdobbins.com|accessdate=26 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nOf the three pro contests held in 2000, only the Ms. International named an overall winner - [[Ondrea Gates|Vickie Gates]], who had won the contest in 1999. The Jan Tana Classic and the Ms. Olympia simply had weight class winners. With Kim Chizevsky-Nicholls retiring from bodybuilding to pursue fitness competition, the Ms. Olympia title was shared by class winners [[Andrulla Blanchette]] and [[Valentina Chepiga]].\n\n[[File:FBB fromt double bicep.jpg|thumb|[[Elena Seiple]] throwing up a front double biceps pose at the NPC Juniors in 2005]]\n\nThe 2001 pro schedule opened routinely enough, with [[Ondrea Gates|Vickie Gates]] winning the Ms. International title for the third consecutive year. However, the Ms. Olympia featured a \"surprise\" winner, as [[Juliette Bergmann]] returned to competition at age 42. Bergmann, the 1986 Pro World champion, had not competed since 1989. Entering the Olympia as a lightweight, she defeated heavyweight winner [[Iris Kyle]] for the overall title. In the five years that the Ms. Olympia was contested in multiple weight classes, this was the only time that the lightweight winner took the overall title.\n\nIn 2002, six-time Olympia winner Lenda Murray returned after a five-year absence. Bergmann (lightweight) and Murray (heavyweight) won the two weight classes in both 2002 and 2003. Murray won the overall title both years, setting a new standard of eight Ms. Olympia titles.\n\nMurray was unseated as Ms. Olympia for the second time in 2004. Iris Kyle, a top pro competitor since 1999, defeated Murray in a close battle in the heavyweight class, and bested lightweight winner [[Dayana Cadeau]] for the overall title. Kyle became only the second woman to win both the Ms. International and Ms. Olympia titles in the same year, matching Kim Chizevsky-Nicholls's feat of 1996.\n\nIn a memo dated December 6, 2004, IFBB Chairman Jim Manion introduced the so-called '20 percent rule', requesting to all IFBB Professional Female Athletes. It read, \u201cFor aesthetics and health reasons, the IFBB Professional Division requests that female athletes in Bodybuilding, Fitness and Figure decrease the amount of muscularity by a factor of 20%. This request for a 20% decrease in the amount of muscularity applies to those female athletes whose physiques require the decrease regardless of whether they compete in Bodybuilding, Fitness or Figure. All professional judges have been advised of the proper criteria for assessing female physiques.\u201d Needless to say the directive created quite a stir, and left many women wondering if they were one of \u201cthose female athletes whose physiques require the decrease\u201d.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifbb.com/ifbbpro/2004news/decrease20.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041207105730/http://www.ifbb.com/ifbbpro/2004news/decrease20.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=7 December 2004|title=IFBB Advisory Notice|date=7 December 2004|access-date=26 August 2018}}</ref> On April 20, 2005, the IFBB adopted, by a 9 for, 1 against, and 3 no votes for Resolution 2005-0001, which announced that starting with the 2005 Ms. Olympia that the IFBB was abolishing the weight class system adopted in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifbb.com/ifbbpro/2005news/resolution2005-001.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050524070205/http://www.ifbb.com/ifbbpro/2005news/resolution2005-001.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=24 May 2005|title=IFBB Advisory Notice 2005-003|date=24 May 2005|access-date=26 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe 2005 contest season saw another double winner, as [[Yaxeni Oriquen-Garcia]] won her third Ms. International title, then edged out defending champion Iris Kyle to win the Ms. Olympia. Also notable in 2005 was the return of [[Jitka Harazimova]], who had last competed in 1999. Harazimova won the Charlotte Pro contest in her return to competition, qualifying her for the Ms. Olympia where she finished fourth. Also in 2005 the documentary ''[[Supersize She]]'' was released. The documentary focused on focused on [[British people|British]] professional female bodybuilder Joanna Thomas and her competing at the 2004 GNC Show of Strength and the [[2004 Ms. Olympia]].\n\nIn 2006, Iris Kyle won both the Ms. International and the Ms. Olympia, repeating her accomplishment of 2004. Iris won the Ms. International and Ms. Olympia for a third time in 2007. Also, in 2007, saw the brief revival of the Jan Tana Classic, which featured two weight classes for the female competitors. The class titles were won by Stephanie Kessler (heavyweight) and [[Sarah Dunlap]] (lightweight), with Dunlap named the overall winner.\n\nThere was a bit of a controversy in the 2008 Ms. International.

In order to win a bodybuilder looking to do this must first win a regional contest weight class. When a bodybuilder wins or places highly they earn an invite to compete at their country's National Championships contest for that year. The winners of each weight class at the National Championships will then go head to head in a separate contest to see who is the overall Champion for the year. Depending on the federation, the overall Champion will be offered a pro card. Some federations offer Pro Cards to winners of individual weight class champions. This can mean that each year more than one bodybuilder may earn a Pro Card.\n\nIn the United States, the NPC (National Physique Committee) is affiliated with the IFBB and awards IFBB Pro Cards. The following competitions award IFBB Pro Cards:\n\n*NPC Women's National Championships has three weight classes: Lightweight, middleweight, and heavyweight. All three class winners in the contest are eligible for professional status.\n*NPC USA Championships has three weight classes. The overall winner is eligible for professional status.\n*IFBB World Championships, each weight class winner is eligible for pro status.\n*IFBB North American Championships, the overall winners is eligible for professional status.\n\n====Pro qualifier competitions====\n\n;2018 Pro Qualifier Pro Card Winners<ref>[http://www.ifbbpro.com/pro-qualifier-pro-card-winners/ 2018 Pro Qualifier Pro Card Winners]</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Amateur Bodybuilders Association|NABBA]] European Championships\n*NABBA Universe\n\n==Fitness and figure competition==\n{{main|Fitness and figure competition}}\n[[File:Balancing act at 2012 Hong Kong Bodybuilding Championship.jpg|thumb|A female competitor during a bodybuilding show in Asia]]\nThere are two other categories of competition that are closely related to bodybuilding, and are frequently held as part of the same event.  Fitness competition has a swimsuit round, and a round that is judged on the performance of a routine including [[aerobics]], dance, or [[gymnastics]].  Figure competition is a newer format, which combines female bodybuilding and gymnastics altogether, is judged solely on symmetry and muscle tone, with much less emphasis on muscle size than in bodybuilding.\n\nIn a competition, each woman poses in a bikini.  She must strike different poses, while facing forward, to the side, and to the rear.  During her poses, she must emphasize her arms, shoulders, chest, stomach, buttocks, and legs by flexing them.  The judges carefully observe, evaluate, then numerically grade the firmness and shapeliness of the woman's physique.\n\n==The Wellness Category==\n\nIn 2005 in Brazil also an important fact occurred for the female bodybuilding, Gustavo Costa at the time President of the IFBB-Rio created the Wellness Category that subsequently gained global proportions becoming one of the official categories <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Campos |first1=Thiago |url=https://www.fontouraeditora.com.br/periodico/upload/artigo/95bff3306b356dfc35ba9efa6a72531c.pdf |title=ANTHROPOMETRIC, DERMATOGLYPHIC AND SOMATOTYPIC INTERVENTION IN ONE OF THE CHAMPIONSHIPS OF THE FEDERATION PARAIBAN OF FISCULTURISM, MUSCULATION AND FITNESS |journal=[[Cole\u00e7\u00e3o Pesquisa em Educa\u00e7\u00e3o F\u00edsica]] |date=2019 |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=75\u201384 |issn=1981-4313}}</ref>\n\n==Sexism and discrimination==\n\nSince the sport of female [[bodybuilding]] was organized, gender discrimination has been an issue. People recognize that part of the feminine identity is sculpting their physical appearances and they usually associate the common feminine identity with slenderness and a trim figure.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Forbes | first1 = Gordan B. | last2 = Brooke | first2 = Rade | last3 = Leah | first3 = Adams-Curtis | year = 2001 | title = Body Dissatisfaction in Women and Men: The Role of Gender-Typing and Self-Esteem | url = | journal = Sex Roles | volume = 44 | issue = 7| pages = 461\u201384 }}</ref> In ''Studies in Popular Culture'' A.J. Randall and colleagues describes this as the result of the [[patriarchal]] society which emphasizes that femininity is created by altering the body for society's gendered expectations <ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Randall | first1 = A. | last2 = Hall | first2 = S. | last3 = Rogers | first3 = M. | year = 1992 | title = Masculinity on stage: Competitive male bodybuilders | url = | journal = Studies in Popular Culture | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 57\u201369 }}</ref> When women venture away from the gender expectations, society's view of their femininity begins to slip. [[Female]] bodybuilders experience this criticism of their body, as they build bodies which are commonly associated with the [[masculine]] identity.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Jennifer | first1 = Wesely | year = 2001 | title = Negotiating Gender, Bodybuilding, and the Natural/Unnatural Continuum | url = | journal = Sociology of Sport Journal | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 162\u201380 }}</ref>  Despite this there is a very dedicated female bodybuilding fan base.\n\nThe [[International Federation of Bodybuilding & Fitness]] has made several rules changes on the sport of female bodybuilding that relate to expected feminine identity. In 1992, the IFBB, attempted to \"feminize\" the sport by making the judges deduct points from competitors who were \u201ctoo big,\u201d meaning too muscular.<ref>Jennifer, Hargreaves. Sporting Females: Critical Issues in the History and Sociology of Women's Sports. London: Routledge, 1994. Print</ref> The IFBB then made a rule change in 2000 that emphasized a need for the women to decrease muscularity once again.<ref name=\"rxmuscle\">Racanelli, Tony. [http://rxmuscle.com/rx-girl-articles/female-bodybuilding/4958-the-evolution-from-women-s-bodybuilding-to-women-s-physique.html \"The Evolution: From Women's Bodybuilding to Women's Physique\"], RX Muscle, 3 February 2012.</ref> Before [[Ms. International]] in 2005 the IFBB created another rule that required the women competing to decrease their own muscle mass by 20 percent to compete.<ref name=\"rxmuscle\" /> Yet the men's [[bodybuilding]] rules have not changed in the same time period. In ''Qualitative Research in Sport and Exercise'' Chris Shilling and Tanya Bunsell state that all of these rule changes reflect the IFBB's attempts to make women more closely fit gender expectations, as they all emphasize the need for the female bodybuilders to become less massive.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Shilling | first1 = Chris | last2 = Bunsell | first2 = Tanya | year = 2009 | title = The Female Bodybuilder as a Gender Outlaw | url = | journal = Qualitative Research in Sport and Exercise | volume = 1 | issue = 2| pages = 141\u201359 }}</ref> Bunsell and Shilling further state that male bodybuilding hasn't changed because their bodies are seen as masculine in identity, while female bodybuilding rules inhibit females from reaching the same muscularity.\n\nFemale bodybuilders are rewarded far less prize money for their competitions than their male counterparts. For example, the 2012 Mr. Olympia winner received $250,000 in prize money while the Ms. Olympia winner only received $28,000 in prize money.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.getbig.com/headlines/2012/07/16/2012-olympia-weekend-prize-money-reaches-900000/ |title=2012 Olympia prize money reaches $900,000! |website=Getbig.com |date=2012-07-16 |accessdate=2012-10-03}}</ref>\n\n===Government bans===\n* [[Afghanistan]] \u2013 Women's bodybuilding is forbidden.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tasvirafghanistan.com/sports-media/627-afghan-womens-strength-on-display-in-gyms |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130203191808/http://www.tasvirafghanistan.com/sports-media/627-afghan-womens-strength-on-display-in-gyms |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-02-03 |title=Afghan Women's Strength on Display in Gyms |publisher=Washington Times |access-date=2012-11-12 }}</ref>\n* [[Iran]] \u2013 On January 18, 2017, an Iranian female bodybuilder was arrested for \"nudity\" after she posted selfies of her flexing sleeveless on social media. \"Nude\", in this context refers to women not wearing a headscarf, or revealing body parts like arms and legs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiatimes.com/news/world/iran-female-bodybuilder-jailed-for-un-islamic-photos-of-her-biceps-and-fitness-workouts-269852.html|title=Iran Female Bodybuilder Jailed For 'Un-Islamic Photos' Of Her Biceps And Fitness Workouts|website=Indiatimes.com|accessdate=26 August 2018|date=2017-01-19}}</ref>\n\n==Performance-enhancing drugs==\nAccording to [[Dan Duchaine]], author of the book ''Underground Steroid Handbook'' and worked with countless world-class female bodybuilders, and Greg Zulak, listed the following performance-enhancing drugs that female bodybuilders may use:\n\n*[[oxymetholone]] (Anadrol)\n*[[oxandrolone]] (Anavar)\n*[[clenbuterol]]\n*[[nandrolone decanoate]] (Deca-Durabolin)\n*[[methandrostenolone]] (Dianabol)\n*[[boldenone]] (Equipose)\n*[[fluoxymesterone]] (Halotestin)\n*[[human growth hormone]]\n*[[ethylestrenol]] (Maxibolan)\n*[[tamoxifen]] (Novaldex)\n*[[methenolone]] (Primabolan)\n*[[trenbolone]]\n*[[stanozolol]] (Winstrol)\n*[[Testosterone]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ironmanmagazine.com/index.cfm?page=article&go2=798 |title=Unchained: Safe Steroid Stack? |website=Ironmanmagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-01}}</ref>\n\n===Side effects===\nAll anabolic steroids have some amount of [[androgens]] that cause massive increase in muscle size and muscularity.

Anabolic steroids were used in a cyclical manner, often with several drugs taken simultaneously. All participants believed that muscle size and strength were increased in association with anabolic steroid use. Most also noted a deepening of the voice, increased facial hair, increased aggressiveness, clitoral enlargement, and menstrual irregularities. The participants were willing to tolerate these side effects but thought that such changes might be unacceptable to many women.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Anabolic steroid use and perceived effects in ten weight-trained women athletes. |year=1985 |pmid=3989963 | volume=253 |issue=19 |journal=JAMA |pages=2871\u20133 | last1 = Strauss | first1 = RH | last2 = Liggett | first2 = MT | last3 = Lanese | first3 = RR | doi=10.1001/jama.1985.03350430083032}}</ref>\n*A 1989 study of competitive female bodybuilders from Kansas and Missouri found that 10% use steroids on a regular basis.

Of the nine anabolic steroid users, seven took multiple anabolic steroids simultaneously. Thirty-fold elevations of serum testosterone were noted in the women injecting testosterone. In three of these women serum testosterone levels exceeded the upper limits for normal male testosterone concentrations. A significant compensatory decrease in sex hormone-binding globulin and a decrease in thyroid-binding proteins were noted in the women steroid users. Also, a 39% decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was noted in the steroid-using weight lifters. Most of the subjects in this study used anabolic steroids continuously, which raises concern about premature atherosclerosis and other disease processes developing in these women.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The incidence of anabolic steroid use among competitive bodybuilders. |year=1991 |pmid=1835565 | volume=165 |issue=5 Pt 1 |journal=Am J Obstet Gynecol |pages=1385\u201390 | last1 = Malarkey | first1 = WB | last2 = Strauss | first2 = RH | last3 = Leizman | first3 = DJ | last4 = Liggett | first4 = M | last5 = Demers | first5 = LM|doi=10.1016/0002-9378(91)90374-z }}</ref>\n*A 2000 survey found that one-third of the female bodybuilders reported past or current steroid use and almost half of those who were non-steroid users admitted use of performance-enhancing drugs such as [[ephedrine]].

The contest formats of men's events during the 1950s to the mid-1970s had often been supplemented with either a women's beauty contest or bikini show. These shows \"had little to do with women's bodybuilding as we know it today, but they did serve as beginning or, perhaps more properly, as a doormat for the development of future bodybuilding shows.\"<ref name=\"Strong and Hard Women\" /><ref name=\"Women of Steel\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X-80e42RtW0C&pg=PA55&lpg=PA55&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Women of Steel: Female Bodybuilders and the Struggle for Self-definition|first=Maria R.|last=Lowe|date=26 August 1998|publisher=NYU Press|accessdate=26 August 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=9780814750940}}</ref> Physique contests for women date back to at least the 1960s with contests like Miss Physique, Miss Body Beautiful U.S.A., W.B.B.G. and Miss Americana, I.F.B.B..

[[Mr. Olympia]], [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] was a judge at the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] in New York when Maria Elena Alberici (aka) Maria Lauren won Miss Americana.<ref>Strength and Health magazine, August, 1972, page 43 by Ralph Pepino</ref><ref>Muscle Builder, Vol 14, Num 2, Page 24, May 1973 by Ben Weider</ref> It was not until the late 1970s, after the advent of the [[feminist movement]] and female [[powerlifting]] events that women were seen as capable of competing in their own bodybuilding competitions.<ref name=\"Strong and Hard Women\" /><ref name=\"Women of Steel\" />\n\n===1977&nbsp;\u2013 1979===\n\nPrior to 1977, bodybuilding had been considered strictly a male-oriented sport. Henry McGhee, described as the \"primary architect of competitive female bodybuilding\", was an employee of the Downtown [[Canton, Ohio|Canton]] [[YMCA]], carried a strong belief that women should share the opportunity to display their physiques and the results of their weight training the way men had done for years. The first official female bodybuilding competition was held in Canton, Ohio, in November 1977 and was called the Ohio Regional Women's Physique Championship. It was judged strictly as a bodybuilding contest and was the first event of its kind for women. Gina LaSpina, the champion, is considered the first recognized winner of a woman's bodybuilding contest. The event organizer, McGhee, told the competitors that they would be judged \"like the men,\" with emphasis on muscular development, symmetry, and physique presentation. In 1978, McGhee organized the first National Women's Physique Championship, along with the short-lived United States Women's Physique Association (USWPA), which he formed to help organize women interested in competing in bodybuilding. The USWPA became defunct in 1980.<ref name=\"The History & Evolution of Women's Bodybuilding\" /><ref name=\"Women of Steel\" />\n\nOn August 18, 1979, promoter George Snyder organized a \"female bodybuilding\" contest known as The Best in the World contest, which was the first IFBB-sanctioned event for women that awarded prize money to the top finishers, with the winner receiving $2,500. It was considered the forerunner for the [[Ms. Olympia]] competition. Although sanctioned as a bodybuilding contest, women were required to appear on stage in high heels. Doris Barrilleaux found the Superior Physique Association (SPA) in 1978, the first women's bodybuilding organization run for women and by women. She also began publishing the SPA News, a newsletter dedicated exclusively to female bodybuilding. SPA disseminated information to women about contests and proper training and dieting. On April 29, 1979, SPA held Florida's first official women's contest in which thirteen women competed. The contest was held in Brandon Florida and promoted by Megas Gym and Doris Barrilleaux. The winner of the show was [[Laura Combes]]. Also in 1979, the IFBB formed the IFBB Women's Committee; Christine Zane was appointed the first chairperson to serve as head of the newly formed committee. One of the significant differences between the SPA and the IFBB was that while the IFBB was organized and run by men, the SPA was run by women and for women.<ref name=\"Women of Steel\" />\n\nMore contests started to appear in 1979. Some of these were the following:\n\n*The second U.S. Women's National Physique Championship, won by [[Kay Baxter]], with Marilyn Schriner second and [[Cammie Lusko]] third.\n*The first [[International Federation of BodyBuilders|IFBB]] Women's World Body Building Championship, held on June 16, won by [[Lisa Lyon]], followed by [[Claudia Wilbourn]], Stella Martinez, [[Stacey Bentley]], and Bette Brown.\n*The Best In The World contest, held at [[Warminster, PA]] on August 18, featuring a $5,000 prize fund, with $2,500 awarded for first place. Patsy Chapman was the winner, followed by April Nicotra, Bentley, Brown, and [[Carla Dunlap-Kaan|Carla Dunlap]]. (Levin, 1980)\n*The [[Robby Robinson (bodybuilder)|Robby Robinson]] Classic, held at the Embassy Auditorium in [[Los Angeles]] on August 25. Bentley finished first, also winning best legs and best poser, followed by Brown, Lusko, and [[Georgia Fudge|Georgia Miller]]. (Roark, 2005)\n\nAlthough these early events were regarded as bodybuilding contests, the women wore [[high-heeled shoe]]s, and did not clench their fists while posing. Additionally, they were not allowed to use the three so-called \"men's poses\" &mdash; the double biceps, crab, and lat spread. The contests were generally held by promoters acting independently; the sport still lacked a governing body. That would change in 1980.\n\n===1980&nbsp;\u2013 1989===\n\nThe 1980s is when female bodybuilding first took off. The early 1980s signified a transition from the fashionably thin \"twiggy\" body to one carrying slightly more muscle mass.<ref name=\"Strong and Hard Women\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Csck0Sst-QkC&pg=PA29&lpg=PA29&dq|title=Strong and Hard Women: An ethnography of female bodybuilding|first=Tanya|last=Bunsell|date=12 April 2013|publisher=Routledge|accessdate=26 August 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=9781136250866}}</ref> The [[National Physique Committee]] (NPC) held the first women's Nationals in 1980. Since its inception, this has been the top amateur level competition for women in the US. [[Laura Combes]] won the inaugural contest. The first World Couples Championship was held in [[Atlantic City]] on April 8. The winning couple was [[Stacey Bentley]] and [[Chris Dickerson (bodybuilder)|Chris Dickerson]], with April Nicotra and Robby Robinson in second. Bentley picked up her third consecutive victory in the [[Frank Zane]] Invitational on June 28, ahead of [[Rachel McLish]], [[Lynn Conkwright]], Suzy Green, [[Patsy Chapman]], and [[Georgia Fudge|Georgia Miller Fudge]].\n\nIn 1980, the first [[Ms. Olympia]] (initially known as the \"Miss\" Olympia), the most prestigious contest for professional female bodybuilders, was held. Initially, the contest was promoted by George Snyder. The contestants had to send in resumes and pictures, and were hand-picked by Snyder based on their potential to be fitness role models for the average American woman. The first winner was [[Rachel McLish]], who had also won the NPC's USA Championship earlier in the year. The contest was a major turning point for the sport of women's bodybuilding. McLish turned out to be very promotable, and inspired many future competitors to start training and competing. Stacey Bentley finished in fifth place, in what turned out to be her final competition. Also in 1980, the [[American Federation of Women Bodybuilders]] was also founded, representing a growing awareness of women bodybuilders in America. Winning competitors such as Laurie Stark (Ms. Southern States, 1988) helped to popularize the federation.<ref name=\"Strong and Hard Women\" /><ref name=\"Women of Steel\" />\n\nRachel McLish became the most successful competitor of the early 1980s. She lost her Ms. Olympia crown by finishing second to [[Ritva Elomaa|Kike Elomaa]] in 1981, but regained the title in 1982. A new major pro contest, the Women's Pro World Championship, was held for the first time in 1981 (won by Lynn Conkwright). Held annually through 1989, this was the second most prestigious contest of the time. McLish added this title to her collection in 1982. George Snyder lost the rights to the Ms. Olympia in 1982, and after this the contestants were no longer hand-picked, but instead qualified for the Ms. Olympia through placings in lesser contests. Women's bodybuilding was officially recognized as a sport discipline by the 1982 IFBB Congress in [[Brugge, Belgium]].<ref name=\"IFBBrulebook\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ifbb.com/pdf/IFBBrulebook.pdf|title=IFBBrulebook|website=Ifbb.com|access-date=February 11, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130813235557/http://www.ifbb.com/pdf/IFBBrulebook.pdf|archive-date=August 13, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAs the sport grew, the competitors' level of training gradually increased as did the use of anabolic steroids (most of the competitors in the earliest shows had very little weight training experience or steroid usage), and the sport slowly evolved towards more muscular physiques. This trend started to emerge in 1983. With McLish not competing in the big shows, [[Carla Dunlap-Kaan|Carla Dunlap]] took both the Pro World and Ms. Olympia titles. Dunlap possessed a more muscular physique than either McLish or Elomaa, and though she never repeated her successes of 1983, she would remain competitive for the rest of the decade.\n\nIn 1984, a new force emerged in women's bodybuilding. [[Corinna Everson|Cory Everson]] won the NPC Nationals, then defeated McLish to win the Ms. Olympia. At 5'9\" and 150 pounds, Everson's physique set a new standard. She would go on to win six consecutive Ms. Olympia titles from 1984 to 1989 before retiring undefeated as a professional, the only female bodybuilder ever to accomplish this.\n\nDuring this period, women's bodybuilding was starting to achieve some serious mainstream exposure. Pro competitor Anita Gandol created a stir by posing for ''[[Playboy]]'' in 1984, earning a one-year suspension from the [[International Federation of BodyBuilders|IFBB]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Erika Mes, a Dutch competitor, posed nude for the [[Belgium|Belgian]] issue of ''Playboy'' in September 1987, also earning a one-year suspension.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Lori Bowen, winner of the 1984 Pro World Championship, appeared in a widely broadcast commercial for [[Miller Lite]] beer with [[Rodney Dangerfield]]. Additionally, competitors Lynn Conkwright (1982) and Carla Dunlap (1984) were included in [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Superstars]]'' competition.\n\nIn 1985, a movie called ''[[Pumping Iron II: The Women]]'' was released. This film documented the preparation of several women for the 1983 [[Caesars Palace]] World Cup Championship. Competitors prominently featured in the film were Kris Alexander, Lori Bowen, Lydia Cheng, [[Carla Dunlap-Kaan|Carla Dunlap]], [[Bev Francis]], and [[Rachel McLish]]. At the time, Francis was actually a [[powerlifting|powerlifter]], though she soon made a successful transition to bodybuilding, becoming one of the leading competitors of the late 1980s and early 1990s. The main theme of the movie pitted the sultry and curvaceous Rachel McLish, the current champion; against the super-muscular Bev Francis. This \"rivalry\" brought to light the true dilemma of Women's Bodybuilding and exposed the root of all the controversy (aesthetics vs size) which was the focal point at that time and which still continues today. In 1985, the National Women's and Mixed Pairs Bodybuilding Championships were held in Detroit, Michigan by promoter/bodybuilder Gema Wheeler (Long). It was the first amateur bodybuilding event televised internationally by ESPN Sports.\n\nFor several years in the mid-1980s, [[NBC]] broadcast coverage of the Ms. Olympia contest on their ''Sportsworld'' program.  The taped footage was telecast months after the contest, and was usually used as secondary material to fill out programs featuring events such as boxing.  Typically, the broadcasts included only the top several women. Nevertheless, Rachel McLish and some of her leading competitors were receiving national TV coverage. McLish authored two New York Times best-selling books - \"Flex Appeal\" (1984) and \"Perfect Parts\" (1987) \u2013 and was also starring in action films. The popularity was growing and women were being empowered and inspired to train. In 1983, the top prize money for the women bodybuilding was $50,000, equal to that of male bodybuilding.\n\nThe [[Ms. International]] contest was introduced in 1986, first won by [[Erika Geisen]]. In 1987 the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] (AAU), who were sanctioning amateur bodybuilding at the time, positioned the International as a premiere amateur event. It was held in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The AAU brought [[Serge Nubret]] (a former Mr. World, Mr. Universe and Mr. Europe) from France to be the featured guest poser. Since 1988, the competition has been sanctioned by the IFBB. Since the demise of the Pro World Championship after 1989, the Ms. International has been second in prestige only to the Ms. Olympia. The 1989 Ms. International was noteworthy for the fact that the original winner, [[Tonya Knight]], was later disqualified for using a surrogate for her drug test at the 1988 Ms. Olympia contest. Consequently, runner-up [[Jackie Paisley]] received the 1989 title. Knight was suspended from [[International Federation of BodyBuilders|IFBB]] competition through the end of 1990, and was forced to return her prize money from the 1988 Ms. Olympia and 1989 Ms. International, a total of $12,000 (Merritt, 2006).\n\n===1990&nbsp;\u2013 1999===\n\nNormally, competitors must qualify for the Ms. Olympia by achieving certain placings in lesser pro contests.  However, the cancellation of the Women's Pro World contest in 1990 left only the Ms. International as a Ms. Olympia qualifier.  Consequently, the IFBB decided to open the Ms. Olympia to all women with pro cards, and a field of thirty competitors entered.  [[Lenda Murray]], a new pro from Michigan, earned a decisive victory and emerged as the successor to Cory Everson.  Murray became the next dominant figure in the sport.\n\nA new professional contest, the Jan Tana Classic, was introduced in 1991. The contest was named for its promoter, a marketer of tanning products, and ran annually until 2003 with the departure of Wayne Demilia (it was later briefly revived in 2007). The inaugural event was won by [[Sue Gafner]]. The Jan Tana filled the void left by the Women's Pro World contest, and occupied the number three slot on the pro circuit throughout its lifetime. 1991 also saw Tonya Knight return to competition, winning the Ms. International.\n\nThe 1991 Ms. Olympia contest was the first to be televised live. Lenda Murray faced a serious challenge from the 1990 runner-up, Bev Francis. Francis had started bodybuilding in the mid-1980s, converting over from powerlifting. Over the years, she had gradually refined her physique to be more in line with judging standards. However, she came to the 1991 contest noticeably larger than in previous years. Francis was leading going into the night show, with Murray needing all of the first place votes to retain her title. Murray managed to do just that, winning a somewhat controversial decision by one point.\n\nIn 1992, there was more controversy, this time at the 1992 Ms. International contest. In response to the increased size displayed by Murray and Francis at the previous Ms. Olympia, along with increasing drug abuse and androgenic side effects, the IFBB made an attempt to \"feminize\" the sport. The IFBB, led by [[Ben Weider]], had created a series of \"femininity\" rules; one line in the judging rules said that competitors should not be \"too big.\" Since extreme size generally requires extreme AAS usage, with more women gaining more androgenic (masculine) side effects, this was clearly an attempt to retain a higher level of female aesthetics and maintain the standard.  The judges\u2019 guide to the competitors stated that they were looking for a highly feminine and optimally developed, but not emaciated physique. The contest winner was Germany's [[Anja Schreiner]], a blue-eyed blonde with a symmetrical physique who weighed 130 pounds at 5'7\". The announcement of her victory met with so much booing from those who prefer size over aesthetics that [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] had to step on stage to address the audience, saying \"the hell with the judges\". Many observers felt that the IFBB had instructed the judges to select the most marketable aesthetic physique, not the most muscular.\n\nThe 1992 Ms. International is also famous for an incident involving British competitor Paula Bircumshaw. Bircumshaw was the same height as Schreiner and possessed a similar level of symmetry and definition, but carried significantly more muscle, weighing in at 162 pounds. She was the clear audience favorite, but was relegated to eighth place. Normally, the top ten contestants are called out at the end of the show when the winners are announced, but the judges only called back the top six, hoping to keep Bircumshaw back stage. This resulted in an uproar from the crowd. With the audience chanting her name, Bircumshaw returned to the stage along with the top six competitors.\n\nAdvertising in ''[[Muscle & Fitness]]'' for the 1992 Ms. Olympia featured Schreiner prominently, relegating two-time defending champion Murray to a small \"also competing\" notice. Nevertheless, Murray also apparently met the \"femininity\" requirements, and managed to retain her title; Schreiner finished sixth, and promptly retired from competition.\n\nFollowing the 1992 debacles, the judging rules were rewritten. The new rules retained provisions for aesthetics, but allowed the contests to be judged as physique contests. Lenda Murray continued to dominate the sport from 1990 to 1995, matching Cory Everson's record of six consecutive Ms. Olympia titles. Murray's closest rival was probably [[Laura Creavalle]], who won the Ms. International title three times, and twice was runner-up to Murray at the Olympia.  During this time, some additional professional shows were held, in addition to the three mainstays. The 1994 schedule included the Canada Pro Cup, won by [[Laura Binetti]], and the first of three annual Grand Prix events in [[Prague]], won by Drorit Kernes. In 1996, the Grand Prix in [[Slovakia]] was added. Besides providing the competitors with extra opportunities to win prize money, these contests also served as additional Ms. Olympia qualifiers.\n\nThe mid-1990s of bodybuilding was known as the \"[[Dorian Yates|Dorian]] Era\", AKA the \"drug years\". In 1996, [[Kim Chizevsky-Nicholls]] would win the Ms. Intentional and dethroned the Ms. International champion, [[Laura Creavalle]]. Also in 1996, she would unseat six-time defending champion, [[Lenda Murray]]. This was the first time a pro female bodybuilder would win both the Ms. International and Ms. Olympia in the same year. She would retain her Ms. Olympia title in 1997 against Lenda Murray, who retired afterwards. At the 1997 Ms. Olympia, she competed at {{convert|157|lb}}. In 1998, she again won the Ms. Olympia title. The 1998 contest was held in [[Prague, Czech Republic]], the first time the competition had been held outside the [[United States]].\n\nAt the 1998 EFBB British Championships, Joanna Thomas won the lightweight and overall title, becoming the youngest woman in the world to ever to win an IFBB pro card at the age of 21.<ref name=\"Destiny\u2019s Child\">{{cite web|url=http://joannathomas.com/about.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030206203941/http://joannathomas.com/about.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 February 2003|title=Joanna Thomas - 2001 Jan Tana Winner|date=6 February 2003|access-date=26 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe 1999 Ms. Olympia was originally scheduled to be held on October 9 in [[Santa Monica, California]]. However, one month before the scheduled date, the IFBB announced that the contest had been cancelled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billdobbins.com/PUBLIC/art/freecoolart/Olyfax02.jpg|title=International Federation of Body-builders|website=Billdobbins.com|accessdate=26 August 2018}}</ref>  The main cause was the withdrawal of promoter Jarka Kastnerova (who promoted the 1998 contest in Prague) for financial reasons, including a low number of advance ticket sales for the 1999 event.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billdobbins.com/PUBLIC/art/freecoolart/Olyfax01.jpg|format=JPG|title=Photographic image of letter|website=Billdobbins.com|accessdate=26 August 2018}}</ref> The backlash following the announcement led to a flurry of activity, with the contest being rescheduled as part of the Women's Extravaganza (promoted by Kenny Kassel and Bob Bonham) in [[Secaucus, New Jersey]] on October 2.  Last minute sponsorship came from several sources, most significantly in the form of $50,000 from ''[[Flex (magazine)|Flex]]'' magazine. Amid all the turmoil, Kim Chizevsky-Nicholls won her fourth consecutive title. Chizevsky-Nicholls decided to retire from bodybuilding after winning the 1999 Ms. Olympia. According to [[Bill Dobbins]], she retired due to gender discrimination guidelines set up by the IFBB that advocated for more \"femininity\" and less \"muscularity\" in the sport.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billdobbins.com/PUBLIC/pages/coolfree/Kimbest.html |title=KIM CHIZEVSKY: THE BEST FEMALE BODYBUILDER OF ALL TIME? |publisher=Bill Dobbins Photography }}</ref>\n\n===2000&nbsp;\u2013 2010===\n\nThe IFBB introduced several changes to Ms. Olympia in 2000. The first change was that Ms. Olympia contest would no longer be held as a separate contest, instead became part of the \"Olympia Weekend\" in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] and held the day before the men's show. The second change was when heavyweight and lightweight classes where added. The third change was the new judging guidelines for presentations were introduced. A letter to the competitors from Jim Manion (chairman of the Professional Judges Committee) stated that women would be judged on healthy appearance, face, makeup, and skin tone. The criteria given in Manion's letter included the statement \"symmetry, presentation, separations, and muscularity BUT NOT TO THE EXTREME!\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billdobbins.com/PUBLIC/art/miscart/criteria.jpg|title=Photographic image of letter|website=Billdobbins.com|accessdate=26 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nOf the three pro contests held in 2000, only the Ms. International named an overall winner - [[Ondrea Gates|Vickie Gates]], who had won the contest in 1999. The Jan Tana Classic and the Ms. Olympia simply had weight class winners. With Kim Chizevsky-Nicholls retiring from bodybuilding to pursue fitness competition, the Ms. Olympia title was shared by class winners [[Andrulla Blanchette]] and [[Valentina Chepiga]].\n\n[[File:FBB fromt double bicep.jpg|thumb|[[Elena Seiple]] throwing up a front double biceps pose at the NPC Juniors in 2005]]\n\nThe 2001 pro schedule opened routinely enough, with [[Ondrea Gates|Vickie Gates]] winning the Ms. International title for the third consecutive year. However, the Ms. Olympia featured a \"surprise\" winner, as [[Juliette Bergmann]] returned to competition at age 42. Bergmann, the 1986 Pro World champion, had not competed since 1989. Entering the Olympia as a lightweight, she defeated heavyweight winner [[Iris Kyle]] for the overall title. In the five years that the Ms. Olympia was contested in multiple weight classes, this was the only time that the lightweight winner took the overall title.\n\nIn 2002, six-time Olympia winner Lenda Murray returned after a five-year absence. Bergmann (lightweight) and Murray (heavyweight) won the two weight classes in both 2002 and 2003. Murray won the overall title both years, setting a new standard of eight Ms. Olympia titles.\n\nMurray was unseated as Ms. Olympia for the second time in 2004. Iris Kyle, a top pro competitor since 1999, defeated Murray in a close battle in the heavyweight class, and bested lightweight winner [[Dayana Cadeau]] for the overall title. Kyle became only the second woman to win both the Ms. International and Ms. Olympia titles in the same year, matching Kim Chizevsky-Nicholls's feat of 1996.\n\nIn a memo dated December 6, 2004, IFBB Chairman Jim Manion introduced the so-called '20 percent rule', requesting to all IFBB Professional Female Athletes. It read, \u201cFor aesthetics and health reasons, the IFBB Professional Division requests that female athletes in Bodybuilding, Fitness and Figure decrease the amount of muscularity by a factor of 20%. This request for a 20% decrease in the amount of muscularity applies to those female athletes whose physiques require the decrease regardless of whether they compete in Bodybuilding, Fitness or Figure. All professional judges have been advised of the proper criteria for assessing female physiques.\u201d Needless to say the directive created quite a stir, and left many women wondering if they were one of \u201cthose female athletes whose physiques require the decrease\u201d.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifbb.com/ifbbpro/2004news/decrease20.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041207105730/http://www.ifbb.com/ifbbpro/2004news/decrease20.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=7 December 2004|title=IFBB Advisory Notice|date=7 December 2004|access-date=26 August 2018}}</ref> On April 20, 2005, the IFBB adopted, by a 9 for, 1 against, and 3 no votes for Resolution 2005-0001, which announced that starting with the 2005 Ms. Olympia that the IFBB was abolishing the weight class system adopted in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifbb.com/ifbbpro/2005news/resolution2005-001.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050524070205/http://www.ifbb.com/ifbbpro/2005news/resolution2005-001.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=24 May 2005|title=IFBB Advisory Notice 2005-003|date=24 May 2005|access-date=26 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe 2005 contest season saw another double winner, as [[Yaxeni Oriquen-Garcia]] won her third Ms. International title, then edged out defending champion Iris Kyle to win the Ms. Olympia. Also notable in 2005 was the return of [[Jitka Harazimova]], who had last competed in 1999. Harazimova won the Charlotte Pro contest in her return to competition, qualifying her for the Ms. Olympia where she finished fourth. Also in 2005 the documentary ''[[Supersize She]]'' was released.

The class titles were won by Stephanie Kessler (heavyweight) and [[Sarah Dunlap]] (lightweight), with Dunlap named the overall winner.\n\nThere was a bit of a controversy in the 2008 Ms. International.

Bodybuilding Championship.jpg|thumb|A female competitor during a bodybuilding show in Asia]]\nThere are two other categories of competition that are closely related to bodybuilding, and are frequently held as part of the same event.  Fitness competition has a swimsuit round, and a round that is judged on the performance of a routine including [[aerobics]], dance, or [[gymnastics]].  Figure competition is a newer format, which combines female bodybuilding and gymnastics altogether, is judged solely on symmetry and muscle tone, with much less emphasis on muscle size than in bodybuilding.\n\nIn a competition, each woman poses in a bikini.  She must strike different poses, while facing forward, to the side, and to the rear.  During her poses, she must emphasize her arms, shoulders, chest, stomach, buttocks, and legs by flexing them.  The judges carefully observe, evaluate, then numerically grade the firmness and shapeliness of the woman's physique.\n\n==The Wellness Category==\n\nIn 2005 in Brazil also an important fact occurred for the female bodybuilding, Gustavo Costa at the time President of the IFBB-Rio created the Wellness Category that subsequently gained global proportions becoming one of the official categories <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Campos |first1=Thiago |url=https://www.fontouraeditora.com.br/periodico/upload/artigo/95bff3306b356dfc35ba9efa6a72531c.pdf |title=ANTHROPOMETRIC, DERMATOGLYPHIC AND SOMATOTYPIC INTERVENTION IN ONE OF THE CHAMPIONSHIPS OF THE FEDERATION PARAIBAN OF FISCULTURISM, MUSCULATION AND FITNESS |journal=[[Cole\u00e7\u00e3o Pesquisa em Educa\u00e7\u00e3o F\u00edsica]] |date=2019 |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=75\u201384 |issn=1981-4313}}</ref>\n\n==Sexism and discrimination==\n\nSince the sport of female [[bodybuilding]] was organized, gender discrimination has been an issue. People recognize that part of the feminine identity is sculpting their physical appearances and they usually associate the common feminine identity with slenderness and a trim figure.<ref>Forbes, Gordan B., Rade Brooke, and Adams-Curtis Leah. \"Body Dissatisfaction in Women and Men: The Role of Gender-Typing and Self-Esteem.\" Sex Roles 44.7 (2001): 461-84. Print.</ref> In ''Studies in Popular Culture'' A.J. Randall and colleagues describes this as the result of the [[patriarchal]] society which emphasizes that femininity is created by altering the body for society's gendered expectations <ref>Randall A., Hall S.,& Rogers, M. \"Masculinity on stage: Competitive male bodybuilders.\" Studies in Popular Culture 14 (1992): 57-69.</ref> When women venture away from the gender expectations, society's view of their femininity begins to slip.

Developed in both the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]], the approach has had transnational impacts.\n\nRecent theories within cultural criminology take into account the role of space (such as urban space) in the construction of crime, positing, for example, that where an action takes place is as important as the effect of the action in determining criminality. The roles of [[anticipation (emotion)|excitement]] and control in cultural criminology has laid the foundation for the sociological concept of \"edgework\".<ref>Lyng, Stephen. 1990. \"Edgework: A social psychological analysis of voluntary risk taking.\" ''American Journal of Sociology'' 95(4):851\u201386.
