{"title_page": "Interactive voice response", "text_new": "{{Redirect|IVR}}\n\n'''Interactive voice response''' ('''IVR''') is a technology that allows a computer to interact with humans through the use of voice and [[dual-tone multi-frequency signaling|DTMF]] tones input via a keypad. In telecommunications, IVR allows customers to interact with a company\u2019s host system via a telephone keypad or by speech recognition, after which services can be inquired about through the IVR dialogue. IVR systems can respond with pre-recorded or dynamically generated audio to further direct users on how to proceed. IVR systems deployed in the network are sized to handle large call volumes and also used for outbound calling, as IVR systems are more intelligent than many [[predictive dialer]] systems.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/future-of-communications/2015/04/20/enhancing-customer-engagement-with-interactive-voice-response/#gref|title=Enhancing customer engagement with interactive voice response|publisher=The Next Web|author=Tolentino, Jamie}}</ref>\n\nIVR systems can be used for mobile purchases, banking payments, services, retail orders, utilities, travel information and weather conditions. A common misconception refers to an [[automated attendant]] as an IVR. The terms are distinct and mean different things to traditional telecommunications professionals\u2014the purpose of an IVR is to take input, process it, and return a result, whereas that of an automated attendant is to route calls. The term '''voice response unit''' ('''VRU''') is sometimes used as well.<ref>{{cite book | isbn=9780471216667 | title=Implementing Voice Over IP | first=Bhumip | last=Khasnabish | location=Lexington, Massachusetts, USA | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nmbexusn9q4C&pg=PA203&dq=vru+ivr&cd=9#v=onepage&q=vru%20ivr&f=false | publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.| page=203 | accessdate=21 March 2012 | date=2003-05-30}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nDespite the increase in IVR technology during the 1970s, the technology was considered complex and expensive for automating tasks in call centers.<ref>{{Cite news|title=History of a business revolution at the end of a phone|publisher=Scotland On Sunday|author=Harrington, Anthony}}</ref> The first commercial application of IVR was an order entry inventory control system designed and developed by Steven Schmidt in 1973. Early voice response systems were DSP technology based and limited to small vocabularies. In the early 1980s, Leon Ferber's Perception Technology became the first mainstream market competitor, after hard drive technology (read/write random-access to digitized voice data) had reached a cost-effective price point.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} At that time, a system could store digitized speech on disk, play the appropriate spoken message, and process the human's DTMF response.\n\nAs call centers began to migrate to multimedia in the late 1990s, companies started to invest in [[computer telephony integration]] (CTI) with IVR systems. IVR became vital for call centers deploying universal queuing and routing solutions and acted as an agent which collected customer data to enable intelligent routing decisions. With improvements in technology, systems could use speaker-independent voice recognition of a limited vocabulary instead of requiring the person to use DTMF signaling.\n\nStarting in the 2000s, voice response became more common and cheaper to deploy. This was due to increased [[Central processing unit|CPU]] power and the migration of speech applications from proprietary code to the [[VoiceXML|VXML]] standard.\n\n== Technology ==\n[[DTMF]] decoding and [[VOICE recognition]] are used to interpret the caller's response to voice prompts. DTMF tones are entered via the [[telephone keypad]].\n\nOther technologies include using [[Speech synthesis|text-to-speech]] (TTS) to speak complex and dynamic information, such as e-mails, news reports or weather information. IVR technology is also being introduced into automobile systems for hands-free operation. TTS is computer generated synthesized speech that is no longer the robotic voice traditionally associated with computers. Real voices create the speech in fragments that are spliced together (concatenated) and smoothed before being played to the caller.\n\nAn IVR can be deployed in several ways:\n\n# Equipment installed on the customer premises\n# Equipment installed in the PSTN (public switched telephone network)\n# [[Application service provider]] (ASP) / hosted IVR\n\nAn [[automatic call distributor]] (ACD) is often the first point of contact when calling many larger businesses. An ACD uses digital storage devices to play greetings or announcements, but typically routes a caller without prompting for input. An IVR can play announcements and request an input from the caller. This information can be used to profile the caller and route the call to an agent with a particular skill set. (A skill set is a function applied to a group of call-center agents with a particular skill.)\n\nInteractive voice response can be used to front-end a [[call center]] operation by identifying the needs of the caller. Information can be obtained from the caller such as an account number. Answers to simple questions such as account balances or pre-recorded information can be provided without operator intervention. Account numbers from the IVR are often compared to [[caller ID]] data for security reasons and additional IVR responses are required if the caller ID does not match the account record.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/interactive-voice-response.htm|title=How Interactive Voice Response (IVR) Works|publisher=How Stuff Works|author=Dave Roos}}</ref>\n\nIVR call flows are created in a variety of ways. A traditional IVR depended upon proprietary programming or scripting languages, whereas modern IVR applications are generated in a similar way to [[World Wide Web|Web]] pages, using standards such as [[VoiceXML]],<ref name=\"VXML\">{{cite web | url = http://www.w3.org/TR/voicexml21 | title = Voice Extensible Markup Language (VoiceXML) Version 2.1 | publisher = W3C}}</ref> [[CCXML]],<ref name=\"CCXML\">{{cite web | url = http://www.w3.org/TR/ccxml | title = Voice Browser Call Control: CCXML Version 1.0 | publisher = W3C }}</ref> [[SRGS]]<ref name=\"SRGS\">{{cite web | url = http://www.w3.org/TR/speech-grammar | title = Speech Recognition Grammar Specification Version 1.0 | publisher = W3C}}</ref> and [[Speech Synthesis Markup Language|SSML]].<ref name=\"SSML\">{{cite web | url = http://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis | title = Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) Version 1.0 | publisher = W3C}}</ref> The ability to use XML-driven applications allows a [[web server]] to act as the [[application server]], freeing the IVR developer to focus on the call flow.\n\nIVR speech recognition interactions (call flows) are designed using 3 approaches to prompt for and recognize user input: directed, open-ended, and mixed dialogue.<ref name=\"advances in commercial deployment\">{{cite book\n | last = Suendermann\n | first = David\n | title = Advances in Commercial Deployment of Spoken Dialog Systems\n | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media]]\n | location = Berlin\n | date = 2011\n | pages = 9\u201311\n | isbn = 9781441996107}}</ref><ref name=\"advances in commercial conversational agents\">{{cite book\n | last = Perez-Marin\n | first = Diana\n | title = Conversational Agents and Natural Language Interaction: Techniques and Effective Practices\n | publisher = IGI Global\n | location = Hershey, Pennsylvania\n | date = 2011\n | page = 340\n | isbn = 9781441996107}}</ref><ref name=\"w3c aural presentation\">{{cite web\n | title = Presentation of Information - Aurally\n | publisher = W3C\n | url = https://www.w3.org/TR/voicexml/#s6.5\n | access-date = 26 October 2016\n }}</ref>\n\nA directed dialogue prompt communicates a set of valid responses to the user (e.g. \"How can I help you? ... Say something like, ''account balance, order status,'' or ''more options''\"). An open-ended prompt does not communicate a set of valid responses (e.g. \"How can I help you?\"). In both cases, the goal is to glean a valid spoken response from the user. The key difference is that with directed dialogue, the user is more likely to speak an option exactly as was communicated by the prompt (e.g. \"account balance\"). With an open-ended prompt, however, the user is likely to include extraneous words or phrases (e.g. \"I was just looking at my bill and saw that my balance was wrong.\"). The open-ended prompt requires a greater degree of [[natural language processing]] to extract the relevant information from the phrase (i.e. \"balance\"). Open-ended recognition also requires a larger [[grammar]] set, which accounts for a wider array of permutations of a given response (e.g. \"balance was wrong\", \"wrong balance\", \"balance is high\", \"high balance\"). Despite the greater amount of data and processing required for open-ended prompts, they are more interactively efficient, as the prompts themselves are typically much shorter.<ref name=\"advances in commercial deployment\"/>\n\nA mixed dialogue approach involves shifting from open-ended to directed dialogue or vice versa within the same interaction, as one type of prompt may be more effective in a given situation. Mixed dialog prompts must also be able to recognize responses that are not relevant to the immediate prompt, for instance in the case of a user deciding to shift to a function different from the current one.<ref name=\"w3c aural presentation\"/><ref name=\"advances in commercial conversational agents\"/>\n\nHigher level IVR development tools are available to further simplify the application development process. A call flow diagram can be drawn with a GUI tool and the presentation layer (typically VoiceXML) can be automatically generated. In addition, these tools normally provide extension mechanisms for software integration, such as an HTTP interface to a website and a [[Java (programming language)|Java]] interface for connecting to a database.\n\nIn [[telecommunications]], an '''audio response unit''' (ARU) is a device that provides synthesized voice responses to DTMF keypresses by processing calls based on (a) the call-originator input, (b) information received from a database, and (c) information in the incoming call, such as the time of day. ARUs increase the number of information calls handled and provide consistent quality in information retrieval.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n== Usage ==\nIVR systems are used to service high call volumes at lower cost. The use of IVR allows callers' queries to be resolved without a live agent. If callers do not find the information they need, the calls may be transferred to a live agent. The approach allows live agents to have more time to deal with complex interactions. When an IVR system answers multiple phone numbers, the use of [[DNIS]] ensures that the correct application and language is executed. A single large IVR system can handle calls for thousands of applications, each with its own phone numbers and script.\n\nCall centers use IVR systems to identify and segment callers. The ability to identify customers allows services to be tailored according to the customer profile. The caller can be given the option to wait in the queue, choose an automated service, or request a callback. The system may obtain [[caller line identification]] (CLI) data from the network to help identify or authenticate the caller. Additional caller authentication data could include account number, personal information, password and biometrics (such as voice print). IVR also enables customer prioritization. In a system wherein individual customers may have a different status, the service will automatically prioritize the individual's call and move customers to the front of a specific queue.\n\nIVRs will also log call detail information into its own database for auditing, performance report, and future IVR system enhancements. [[Computer telephony integration|CTI]] allows a contact center or organization to gather information about the caller as a means of directing the inquiry to the appropriate agent. CTI can transfer relevant information about the individual customer and the IVR dialog from the IVR to the agent desktop using a [[Screen pop|screen-pop]], making for a more effective and efficient service. Voice-activated dialing (VAD) IVR systems are used to automate routine inquiries to a switchboard or [[PABX]] (Private Automatic Branch exchange) operators, and are used in many hospitals and large businesses to reduce the caller waiting time. An additional function is the ability to allow external callers to page staff and transfer the inbound call to the paged person. IVR can be used to provide a more sophisticated [[voice mail]] experience to the caller.\n\n===Banking===\nBanking institutions are reliant on IVR systems for [[customer engagement]] and to extend business hours to a [[24/7]] operation. [[Telephone banking]] allows customers to check balances and transaction histories as well as to make payments and transfers. As online channels have emerged, banking customer satisfaction has decreased.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itproportal.com/2016/05/10/interactive-voice-response-ivr-the-missing-link/|title=Interactive Voice Response (IVR): The missing link|publisher=IT Pro Portal|author=Comes, Sherry}}</ref>\n\n=== Medical ===\nIVR systems are used by pharmaceutical companies and [[contract research organization]]s to conduct [[clinical trial]]s and manage the large volumes of data generated. The caller will respond to questions in their preferred language and their responses will be logged into a database and possibly recorded at the same time to confirm authenticity. Applications include patient randomization and drug supply management. They are also used in recording patient diaries and questionnaires.<ref name=\"Lam2009\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Lam MY, Lee H, Bright R, Korzenik JR, Sands BE |title=Validation of interactive voice response system administration of the Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire |journal=Inflamm.

Hospitals and clinics have used IVR systems to allow callers to receive anonymous access to test results. This is information that could easily be handled by a person but the IVR system is used to preserve privacy and avoid potential embarrassment of sensitive information or test results. Users are given a passcode to access their results.\n\n=== Surveying ===\nSome of the largest installed IVR platforms are used for televoting on television game shows, such as ''[[Pop Idol]]'' and ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'', which can generate enormous call spikes. The network provider will often deploy ''[[call gapping]]'' in the [[PSTN]] to prevent network overload. IVR may also be used by survey organizations to ask more sensitive questions where the investigators are concerned that a respondent might feel less comfortable providing these answers to a human interlocutor (such as questions about drug use or sexual behavior). In some cases, an IVR system can be used in the same survey in conjunction with a human interviewer.\n\n==Social Impact ==\nBy allowing\u00a0low-literacy populations to interact with technology, IVR systems form an avenue to build technological skills in developing countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/sites/default/files/unesco-pearson_draft_guidelines_for_digital_inclusion.pdf|title=Unesco Guidelines for Digital Inclusion|publisher=Unesco}}</ref> Developing countries have a prevalence of mobile phones even in rural areas which make provide room for IVR technology to support social good projects. However, most IVR technology is designed in resource-rich domains hence research is necessary to contextualize and adapt this technology for developing countries.<ref name=\":0\">{{Citation|title=Information and communication technologies for development|date=2019-03-03|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Information_and_communication_technologies_for_development&oldid=885920797|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref> Research in ICTD has helped tailor IVR towards social impact has created innovative applications in health, agricultural, entertainment and citizen journalism.\n\n=== Agriculture ===\nIn rural India, it is critical for farmers to obtain information early. Although television and radio have made it easy to spread information in remote areas, farmers need community support to transform these messages into actionable advice. One of the early research projects in ICTD\u00a0 and IVR was Avaaj Otalo.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Patel|first=Neil|last2=Chittamuru|first2=Deepti|last3=Jain|first3=Anupam|last4=Dave|first4=Paresh|last5=Parikh|first5=Tapan S.|date=2010|title=Avaaj Otalo: A Field Study of an Interactive Voice Forum for Small Farmers in Rural India|journal=Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|series=CHI '10|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=733\u2013742|doi=10.1145/1753326.1753434|isbn=9781605589299}}</ref> This project was stemmed out of a \u00a0research project in 2009. In Avaaj Otalo, farmers could avail information by dialing a phone number and navigating through simple audio prompts, they also had the liberty to record questions their peers or local NGO staff. This research project has hence spun off as a company called Awaaz.de<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://awaaz.de/|title=Awaaz.De {{!}} Mobile Solutions for Social Impact|website=awaaz.de|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref> a social enterprise that works with developmental organizations by providing tools for them to work with marginalized users.\n\n=== Healthcare ===\nIn the context of tuberculosis, patients need to adhere to the medicine daily basis for a period of few months to completely heal. In public sector, there is a scheme called [[Directly observed treatment, short-course|DOTS]] (Directly Observed Therapy Short Course<ref>{{Citation|title=Directly observed treatment, short-course|date=2018-11-03|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Directly_observed_treatment,_short-course&oldid=867126871|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref>) which was the most effective source for poor population. However, this method requires the patient to commute to the clinic everyday which adds financial and time constraints to the patient.\n\n99DOTS<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.99dots.org/|title=99DOTS|website=www.99dots.org|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref> is a project that uses good ICTD principles<ref name=\":0\" /> to use IVR technology to benefit TB patients. Patients have a customized packet of tablets that they receive from the healthcare official who trains them to take the medicine in the sequence daily. Opening the packet in a sequence reveals a phone number that the patient needs to dial to acknowledge that they have taken the medicine. This research project was based out of Microsoft Research India by Bill Theis and who received MacArthur Fellowship for the project.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.macfound.org/fellows/973/|title=Bill Thies - MacArthur Foundation|website=www.macfound.org|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref> The project has spun off as Everwell Technologies<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.everwell.org/|title=Everwell|website=www.everwell.org|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref> which now works closely with the Government of India to scale this technology to patients throughout India.\n\n=== Community-based entertainment ===\nAlthough Radio is a very popular means of entertainment, IVR provides interactivity which can help engage in novel ways using their phones. ICTD research has used IVR entertainment as a mechanism to support communities and provide information to populations that are hard to reach by traditional methods.\n\n* Sangeet Swara:<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vashistha|first=Aditya|last2=Cutrell|first2=Edward|last3=Borriello|first3=Gaetano|last4=Thies|first4=William|date=2015|title=Sangeet Swara: A Community-Moderated Voice Forum in Rural India|journal=Proceedings of the 33rd Annual ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|series=CHI '15|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=417\u2013426|doi=10.1145/2702123.2702191|isbn=9781450331456}}</ref> voice-based singing platform for low literate users in India.

The system was moderated by editors who listened to these messages and later transcribed these messages onto a blog.\n\n== Developments ==\n=== Video ===\nThe introduction of [[Session initiation protocol|Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP) means that point-to-point communications are no longer restricted to voice calls but can now be extended to multimedia technologies such as [[video]]. IVR manufacturers have extended their systems into IVVR (interactive voice and video response), especially for the mobile phone networks. The use of video gives IVR systems the ability to implement [[multimodal interaction]] with the caller.\n\nThe introduction of [[full-duplex]] video IVR in the future will allow systems the ability to read emotions and facial expressions. It may also be used to identify the caller, using technology such as [[Iris scan]] or other [[biometric]] means. Recordings of the caller may be stored to monitor certain transactions and can be used to reduce identity fraud.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nojitter.com/post/240171759/goodbye-ivr-hello-ivisuali-ivr|title=Goodbye IVR... Hello Visual IVR|publisher=No Jitter}}</ref>\n\n=== SIP contact center ===\nWith the introduction of SIP contact centers, call control in a SIP contact center can be implemented by [[CCXML]] scripting, which is an adjunct to the [[VXML]] language used to generate modern IVR dialogues. As calls are queued in the SIP contact center, the IVR system can provide treatment or automation, wait for a fixed period, or play music. Inbound calls to a SIP contact center must be queued or terminated against a SIP end point; SIP IVR systems can be used to replace agents directly by the use of applications deployed using BBUA (back-to-back user agents).\n\n=== Interactive messaging response (IMR) ===\nDue to the introduction of [[instant messaging]] (IM) in contact centers, agents can handle up to 6 different IM conversations at the same time, which increases agent productivity.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} IVR technology is being used to automate IM conversations using existing [[natural language processing]] software. This differs from email handling as email automated response is based on key word spotting and IM conversations are conversational. The use of text messaging abbreviations and smilies requires different grammars to those currently used for speech recognition. IM is also starting to replace text messaging on multimedia mobile handsets.\n\n=== Hosted vs. on-premises IVR ===\nWith the introduction of [[web services]] into the contact center, host integration has been simplified, allowing IVR applications to be hosted remotely from the contact center. This has meant hosted IVR applications using speech are now available to smaller contact centers across the globe and has led to an expansion of ASP (application service providers).\n\nIVR applications can also be hosted on the public network, without contact center integration. Services include public announcement messages and message services for small business. It is also possible to deploy two-prong IVR services where the initial IVR application is used to route the call to the appropriate contact center. This can be used to balance loading across multiple contact centers or provide business continuity in the event of a system outage.\n\n==Criticism==\nIVR has historically received criticism for its difficulty of use and a lack of appreciation of the caller's needs as well as objections to providing a voice response to an automated system. However, modern IVR systems are able to include caller context and provide personalized options. Companies have also been criticized for using IVR to reduce operational costs as the solution replaces the need for human agents to address voice inquiries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/chat-bots-are-cool-but-will-they-replace-humans/|title=Chat Bots Are Cool, But Will They Replace Humans?|publisher=CMS Wire}}</ref>  Additionally, as basic information is now available online, the calls coming into a call center are more likely to be complex problems and not ones that can be resolved in an automated fashion, thus requiring the attention of a live agent.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Automated attendant]]\n*[[Automatic call distributor]]\n*[[Automatic number identification]]\n*[[Call avoidance]]\n*[[Call Whisper|Call whisper]]\n*[[Dialog system]]\n*[[DNIS]]\n*[[Dual-tone multi-frequency]] (DTMF)\n*[[Electronic patient-reported outcome]]\n*[[Natural language]]\n*[[Speech recognition]]\n*[[Speech synthesis]]\n*[[Voice portal]]\n*[[The Voder]]\n*[[Voice-based marketing automation]]\n*[[Voice User Interface]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n[https://www.enjayworld.com/blog/cti-computer-telephony-integration/ CTI \u2013 Computer Telephony Integration]\n\n==External links==\n<!-- ATTENTION!

IVR systems can respond with pre-recorded or dynamically generated audio to further direct users on how to proceed. IVR systems deployed in the network are sized to handle large call volumes and also used for outbound calling, as IVR systems are more intelligent than many [[predictive dialer]] systems.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/future-of-communications/2015/04/20/enhancing-customer-engagement-with-interactive-voice-response/#gref|title=Enhancing customer engagement with interactive voice response|publisher=The Next Web|author=Tolentino, Jamie}}</ref>\n\nIVR systems can be used for mobile purchases, banking payments, services, retail orders, utilities, travel information and weather conditions. A common misconception refers to an [[automated attendant]] as an IVR. The terms are distinct and mean different things to traditional telecommunications professionals\u2014the purpose of an IVR is to take input, process it, and return a result, whereas that of an automated attendant is to route calls. The term '''voice response unit''' ('''VRU''') is sometimes used as well.<ref>{{cite book | isbn=9780471216667 | title=Implementing Voice Over IP | first=Bhumip | last=Khasnabish | location=Lexington, Massachusetts, USA | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nmbexusn9q4C&pg=PA203&dq=vru+ivr&cd=9#v=onepage&q=vru%20ivr&f=false | publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.| page=203 | accessdate=21 March 2012 | date=2003-05-30}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nDespite the increase in IVR technology during the 1970s, the technology was considered complex and expensive for automating tasks in call centers.<ref>{{Cite news|title=History of a business revolution at the end of a phone|publisher=Scotland On Sunday|author=Harrington, Anthony}}</ref> The first commercial application of IVR was an order entry inventory control system designed and developed by Steven Schmidt in 1973. Early voice response systems were DSP technology based and limited to small vocabularies. In the early 1980s, Leon Ferber's Perception Technology became the first mainstream market competitor, after hard drive technology (read/write random-access to digitized voice data) had reached a cost-effective price point.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} At that time, a system could store digitized speech on disk, play the appropriate spoken message, and process the human's DTMF response.\n\nAs call centers began to migrate to multimedia in the late 1990s, companies started to invest in [[computer telephony integration]] (CTI) with IVR systems. IVR became vital for call centers deploying universal queuing and routing solutions and acted as an agent which collected customer data to enable intelligent routing decisions. With improvements in technology, systems could use speaker-independent voice recognition of a limited vocabulary instead of requiring the person to use DTMF signaling.\n\nStarting in the 2000s, voice response became more common and cheaper to deploy. This was due to increased [[Central processing unit|CPU]] power and the migration of speech applications from proprietary code to the [[VoiceXML|VXML]] standard.\n\n== Technology ==\n[[DTMF]] decoding and [[VOICE recognition]] are used to interpret the caller's response to voice prompts. DTMF tones are entered via the [[telephone keypad]].\n\nOther technologies include using [[Speech synthesis|text-to-speech]] (TTS) to speak complex and dynamic information, such as e-mails, news reports or weather information. IVR technology is also being introduced into automobile systems for hands-free operation. TTS is computer generated synthesized speech that is no longer the robotic voice traditionally associated with computers. Real voices create the speech in fragments that are spliced together (concatenated) and smoothed before being played to the caller.\n\nAn IVR can be deployed in several ways:\n\n# Equipment installed on the customer premises\n# Equipment installed in the PSTN (public switched telephone network)\n# [[Application service provider]] (ASP) / hosted IVR\n\nAn [[automatic call distributor]] (ACD) is often the first point of contact when calling many larger businesses. An ACD uses digital storage devices to play greetings or announcements, but typically routes a caller without prompting for input. An IVR can play announcements and request an input from the caller. This information can be used to profile the caller and route the call to an agent with a particular skill set. (A skill set is a function applied to a group of call-center agents with a particular skill.)\n\nInteractive voice response can be used to front-end a [[call center]] operation by identifying the needs of the caller. Information can be obtained from the caller such as an account number. Answers to simple questions such as account balances or pre-recorded information can be provided without operator intervention. Account numbers from the IVR are often compared to [[caller ID]] data for security reasons and additional IVR responses are required if the caller ID does not match the account record.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/interactive-voice-response.htm|title=How Interactive Voice Response (IVR) Works|publisher=How Stuff Works|author=Dave Roos}}</ref>\n\nIVR call flows are created in a variety of ways. A traditional IVR depended upon proprietary programming or scripting languages, whereas modern IVR applications are generated in a similar way to [[World Wide Web|Web]] pages, using standards such as [[VoiceXML]],<ref name=\"VXML\">{{cite web | url = http://www.w3.org/TR/voicexml21 | title = Voice Extensible Markup Language (VoiceXML) Version 2.1 | publisher = W3C}}</ref> [[CCXML]],<ref name=\"CCXML\">{{cite web | url = http://www.w3.org/TR/ccxml | title = Voice Browser Call Control: CCXML Version 1.0 | publisher = W3C }}</ref> [[SRGS]]<ref name=\"SRGS\">{{cite web | url = http://www.w3.org/TR/speech-grammar | title = Speech Recognition Grammar Specification Version 1.0 | publisher = W3C}}</ref> and [[Speech Synthesis Markup Language|SSML]].<ref name=\"SSML\">{{cite web | url = http://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis | title = Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) Version 1.0 | publisher = W3C}}</ref> The ability to use XML-driven applications allows a [[web server]] to act as the [[application server]], freeing the IVR developer to focus on the call flow.\n\nIVR speech recognition interactions (call flows) are designed using 3 approaches to prompt for and recognize user input: directed, open-ended, and mixed dialogue.<ref name=\"advances in commercial deployment\">{{cite book\n | last = Suendermann\n | first = David\n | title = Advances in Commercial Deployment of Spoken Dialog Systems\n | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media]]\n | location = Berlin\n | date = 2011\n | pages = 9\u201311\n | isbn = 9781441996107}}</ref><ref name=\"advances in commercial conversational agents\">{{cite book\n | last = Perez-Marin\n | first = Diana\n | title = Conversational Agents and Natural Language Interaction: Techniques and Effective Practices\n | publisher = IGI Global\n | location = Hershey, Pennsylvania\n | date = 2011\n | page = 340\n | isbn = 9781441996107}}</ref><ref name=\"w3c aural presentation\">{{cite web\n | title = Presentation of Information - Aurally\n | publisher = W3C\n | url = https://www.w3.org/TR/voicexml/#s6.5\n | access-date = 26 October 2016\n }}</ref>\n\nA directed dialogue prompt communicates a set of valid responses to the user (e.g. \"How can I help you? ... Say something like, ''account balance, order status,'' or ''more options''\"). An open-ended prompt does not communicate a set of valid responses (e.g. \"How can I help you?\"). In both cases, the goal is to glean a valid spoken response from the user. The key difference is that with directed dialogue, the user is more likely to speak an option exactly as was communicated by the prompt (e.g. \"account balance\"). With an open-ended prompt, however, the user is likely to include extraneous words or phrases (e.g. \"I was just looking at my bill and saw that my balance was wrong.\"). The open-ended prompt requires a greater degree of [[natural language processing]] to extract the relevant information from the phrase (i.e. \"balance\"). Open-ended recognition also requires a larger [[grammar]] set, which accounts for a wider array of permutations of a given response (e.g. \"balance was wrong\", \"wrong balance\", \"balance is high\", \"high balance\"). Despite the greater amount of data and processing required for open-ended prompts, they are more interactively efficient, as the prompts themselves are typically much shorter.<ref name=\"advances in commercial deployment\"/>\n\nA mixed dialogue approach involves shifting from open-ended to directed dialogue or vice versa within the same interaction, as one type of prompt may be more effective in a given situation. Mixed dialog prompts must also be able to recognize responses that are not relevant to the immediate prompt, for instance in the case of a user deciding to shift to a function different from the current one.<ref name=\"w3c aural presentation\"/><ref name=\"advances in commercial conversational agents\"/>\n\nHigher level IVR development tools are available to further simplify the application development process. A call flow diagram can be drawn with a GUI tool and the presentation layer (typically VoiceXML) can be automatically generated. In addition, these tools normally provide extension mechanisms for software integration, such as an HTTP interface to a website and a [[Java (programming language)|Java]] interface for connecting to a database.\n\nIn [[telecommunications]], an '''audio response unit''' (ARU) is a device that provides synthesized voice responses to DTMF keypresses by processing calls based on (a) the call-originator input, (b) information received from a database, and (c) information in the incoming call, such as the time of day. ARUs increase the number of information calls handled and provide consistent quality in information retrieval.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n== Usage ==\nIVR systems are used to service high call volumes at lower cost. The use of IVR allows callers' queries to be resolved without a live agent. If callers do not find the information they need, the calls may be transferred to a live agent. The approach allows live agents to have more time to deal with complex interactions. When an IVR system answers multiple phone numbers, the use of [[DNIS]] ensures that the correct application and language is executed. A single large IVR system can handle calls for thousands of applications, each with its own phone numbers and script.\n\nCall centers use IVR systems to identify and segment callers. The ability to identify customers allows services to be tailored according to the customer profile. The caller can be given the option to wait in the queue, choose an automated service, or request a callback. The system may obtain [[caller line identification]] (CLI) data from the network to help identify or authenticate the caller. Additional caller authentication data could include account number, personal information, password and biometrics (such as voice print). IVR also enables customer prioritization. In a system wherein individual customers may have a different status, the service will automatically prioritize the individual's call and move customers to the front of a specific queue.\n\nIVRs will also log call detail information into its own database for auditing, performance report, and future IVR system enhancements. [[Computer telephony integration|CTI]] allows a contact center or organization to gather information about the caller as a means of directing the inquiry to the appropriate agent. CTI can transfer relevant information about the individual customer and the IVR dialog from the IVR to the agent desktop using a [[Screen pop|screen-pop]], making for a more effective and efficient service. Voice-activated dialing (VAD) IVR systems are used to automate routine inquiries to a switchboard or [[PABX]] (Private Automatic Branch exchange) operators, and are used in many hospitals and large businesses to reduce the caller waiting time. An additional function is the ability to allow external callers to page staff and transfer the inbound call to the paged person. IVR can be used to provide a more sophisticated [[voice mail]] experience to the caller.\n\n===Banking===\nBanking institutions are reliant on IVR systems for [[customer engagement]] and to extend business hours to a [[24/7]] operation. [[Telephone banking]] allows customers to check balances and transaction histories as well as to make payments and transfers. As online channels have emerged, banking customer satisfaction has decreased.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itproportal.com/2016/05/10/interactive-voice-response-ivr-the-missing-link/|title=Interactive Voice Response (IVR): The missing link|publisher=IT Pro Portal|author=Comes, Sherry}}</ref>\n\n=== Medical ===\nIVR systems are used by pharmaceutical companies and [[contract research organization]]s to conduct [[clinical trial]]s and manage the large volumes of data generated. The caller will respond to questions in their preferred language and their responses will be logged into a database and possibly recorded at the same time to confirm authenticity. Applications include patient randomization and drug supply management. They are also used in recording patient diaries and questionnaires.<ref name=\"Lam2009\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Lam MY, Lee H, Bright R, Korzenik JR, Sands BE |title=Validation of interactive voice response system administration of the Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire |journal=Inflamm.

Hospitals and clinics have used IVR systems to allow callers to receive anonymous access to test results. This is information that could easily be handled by a person but the IVR system is used to preserve privacy and avoid potential embarrassment of sensitive information or test results. Users are given a passcode to access their results.\n\n=== Surveying ===\nSome of the largest installed IVR platforms are used for televoting on television game shows, such as ''[[Pop Idol]]'' and ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'', which can generate enormous call spikes. The network provider will often deploy ''[[call gapping]]'' in the [[PSTN]] to prevent network overload. IVR may also be used by survey organizations to ask more sensitive questions where the investigators are concerned that a respondent might feel less comfortable providing these answers to a human interlocutor (such as questions about drug use or sexual behavior). In some cases, an IVR system can be used in the same survey in conjunction with a human interviewer.\n\n==Social Impact ==\nBy allowing\u00a0low-literacy populations to interact with technology, IVR systems form an avenue to build technological skills in developing countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/sites/default/files/unesco-pearson_draft_guidelines_for_digital_inclusion.pdf|title=Unesco Guidelines for Digital Inclusion|publisher=Unesco}}</ref> Developing countries have a prevalence of mobile phones even in rural areas which make provide room for IVR technology to support social good projects. However, most IVR technology is designed in resource-rich domains hence research is necessary to contextualize and adapt this technology for developing countries.<ref name=\":0\">{{Citation|title=Information and communication technologies for development|date=2019-03-03|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Information_and_communication_technologies_for_development&oldid=885920797|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref> Research in ICTD has helped tailor IVR towards social impact has created innovative applications in health, agricultural, entertainment and citizen journalism.\n\n=== Agriculture ===\nIn rural India, it is critical for farmers to obtain information early. Although television and radio have made it easy to spread information in remote areas, farmers need community support to transform these messages into actionable advice. One of the early research projects in ICTD\u00a0 and IVR was Avaaj Otalo.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Patel|first=Neil|last2=Chittamuru|first2=Deepti|last3=Jain|first3=Anupam|last4=Dave|first4=Paresh|last5=Parikh|first5=Tapan S.|date=2010|title=Avaaj Otalo: A Field Study of an Interactive Voice Forum for Small Farmers in Rural India|journal=Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|series=CHI '10|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=733\u2013742|doi=10.1145/1753326.1753434|isbn=9781605589299}}</ref> This project was stemmed out of a \u00a0research project in 2009. In Avaaj Otalo, farmers could avail information by dialing a phone number and navigating through simple audio prompts, they also had the liberty to record questions their peers or local NGO staff. This research project has hence spun off as a company called Awaaz.de<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://awaaz.de/|title=Awaaz.De {{!}} Mobile Solutions for Social Impact|website=awaaz.de|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref> a social enterprise that works with developmental organizations by providing tools for them to work with marginalized users.\n\n=== Healthcare ===\nIn the context of tuberculosis, patients need to adhere to the medicine daily basis for a period of few months to completely heal. In public sector, there is a scheme called [[Directly observed treatment, short-course|DOTS]] (Directly Observed Therapy Short Course<ref>{{Citation|title=Directly observed treatment, short-course|date=2018-11-03|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Directly_observed_treatment,_short-course&oldid=867126871|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref>) which was the most effective source for poor population. However, this method requires the patient to commute to the clinic everyday which adds financial and time constraints to the patient.\n\n99DOTS<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.99dots.org/|title=99DOTS|website=www.99dots.org|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref> is a project that uses good ICTD principles<ref name=\":0\" /> to use IVR technology to benefit TB patients. Patients have a customized packet of tablets that they receive from the healthcare official who trains them to take the medicine in the sequence daily. Opening the packet in a sequence reveals a phone number that the patient needs to dial to acknowledge that they have taken the medicine. This research project was based out of Microsoft Research India by Bill Theis and who received MacArthur Fellowship for the project.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.macfound.org/fellows/973/|title=Bill Thies - MacArthur Foundation|website=www.macfound.org|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref> The project has spun off as Everwell Technologies<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.everwell.org/|title=Everwell|website=www.everwell.org|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref> which now works closely with the Government of India to scale this technology to patients throughout India.\n\n=== Community-based entertainment ===\nAlthough Radio is a very popular means of entertainment, IVR provides interactivity which can help engage in novel ways using their phones. ICTD research has used IVR entertainment as a mechanism to support communities and provide information to populations that are hard to reach by traditional methods.\n\n* Sangeet Swara:<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vashistha|first=Aditya|last2=Cutrell|first2=Edward|last3=Borriello|first3=Gaetano|last4=Thies|first4=William|date=2015|title=Sangeet Swara: A Community-Moderated Voice Forum in Rural India|journal=Proceedings of the 33rd Annual ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|series=CHI '15|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=417\u2013426|doi=10.1145/2702123.2702191|isbn=9781450331456}}</ref> voice-based singing platform for low literate users in India.

The system was moderated by editors who listened to these messages and later transcribed these messages onto a blog.\n\n== Developments ==\n=== Video ===\nThe introduction of [[Session initiation protocol|Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP) means that point-to-point communications are no longer restricted to voice calls but can now be extended to multimedia technologies such as [[video]]. IVR manufacturers have extended their systems into IVVR (interactive voice and video response), especially for the mobile phone networks. The use of video gives IVR systems the ability to implement [[multimodal interaction]] with the caller.\n\nThe introduction of [[full-duplex]] video IVR in the future will allow systems the ability to read emotions and facial expressions. It may also be used to identify the caller, using technology such as [[Iris scan]] or other [[biometric]] means. Recordings of the caller may be stored to monitor certain transactions and can be used to reduce identity fraud.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nojitter.com/post/240171759/goodbye-ivr-hello-ivisuali-ivr|title=Goodbye IVR... Hello Visual IVR|publisher=No Jitter}}</ref>\n\n=== SIP contact center ===\nWith the introduction of SIP contact centers, call control in a SIP contact center can be implemented by [[CCXML]] scripting, which is an adjunct to the [[VXML]] language used to generate modern IVR dialogues. As calls are queued in the SIP contact center, the IVR system can provide treatment or automation, wait for a fixed period, or play music. Inbound calls to a SIP contact center must be queued or terminated against a SIP end point; SIP IVR systems can be used to replace agents directly by the use of applications deployed using BBUA (back-to-back user agents).\n\n=== Interactive messaging response (IMR) ===\nDue to the introduction of [[instant messaging]] (IM) in contact centers, agents can handle up to 6 different IM conversations at the same time, which increases agent productivity.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} IVR technology is being used to automate IM conversations using existing [[natural language processing]] software. This differs from email handling as email automated response is based on key word spotting and IM conversations are conversational. The use of text messaging abbreviations and smilies requires different grammars to those currently used for speech recognition. IM is also starting to replace text messaging on multimedia mobile handsets.\n\n=== Hosted vs. on-premises IVR ===\nWith the introduction of [[web services]] into the contact center, host integration has been simplified, allowing IVR applications to be hosted remotely from the contact center. This has meant hosted IVR applications using speech are now available to smaller contact centers across the globe and has led to an expansion of ASP (application service providers).\n\nIVR applications can also be hosted on the public network, without contact center integration. Services include public announcement messages and message services for small business. It is also possible to deploy two-prong IVR services where the initial IVR application is used to route the call to the appropriate contact center. This can be used to balance loading across multiple contact centers or provide business continuity in the event of a system outage.\n\n==Criticism==\nIVR has historically received criticism for its difficulty of use and a lack of appreciation of the caller's needs as well as objections to providing a voice response to an automated system. However, modern IVR systems are able to include caller context and provide personalized options. Companies have also been criticized for using IVR to reduce operational costs as the solution replaces the need for human agents to address voice inquiries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/chat-bots-are-cool-but-will-they-replace-humans/|title=Chat Bots Are Cool, But Will They Replace Humans?|publisher=CMS Wire}}</ref>  Additionally, as basic information is now available online, the calls coming into a call center are more likely to be complex problems and not ones that can be resolved in an automated fashion, thus requiring the attention of a live agent.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Automated attendant]]\n*[[Automatic call distributor]]\n*[[Automatic number identification]]\n*[[Call avoidance]]\n*[[Call Whisper|Call whisper]]\n*[[Dialog system]]\n*[[DNIS]]\n*[[Dual-tone multi-frequency]] (DTMF)\n*[[Electronic patient-reported outcome]]\n*[[Natural language]]\n*[[Speech recognition]]\n*[[Speech synthesis]]\n*[[Voice portal]]\n*[[The Voder]]\n*[[Voice-based marketing automation]]\n*[[Voice User Interface]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n<!-- ATTENTION!

In its native environment, ''Lewisiopsis'' can handle temperature below {{convert|30|F|C}} degrees, although the flowers may die.\n\n==Cultivation==\nThe nursery trade has taken some interest in cultivating ''Lewisiopsis'' because it is perennial, has showy blooms and it is drought tolerant.<ref name=potw/> In wet climates, if the [[root crown]] of the plant gets wet, it will die causing the death of the entire plant. If cultured, perfect drainage is required for survival. The use of broken or crushed rock mixed with [[humus]] will keep the plant alive. Placing a small rock under the crowns can prevent the crown from getting wet. The plant will not die of thirst because the leathery leaves and roots will store enough water.\n\nThis plant, under the name ''Lewisia tweedyi'', together with the white-flowered [[cultivar]] \u2018Alba\u2019<ref>{{cite web \n| url = https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/95102/i-Lewisia-tweedyi-i-Alba/Details| title = RHS Plantfinder - ''Lewisia tweedyi'' \u2018Alba\u2019 \n| accessdate = 22 March 2018}}</ref>  has gained the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]\u2019s [[Award of Garden Merit]].<ref name = RHSPF>{{cite web | url= https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/10057/i-Lewisia-tweedyi-i/Details| title = RHS Plantfinder - ''Lewisia tweedyi'' \n| accessdate=22 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/pdfs/agm-lists/agm-ornamentals.pdf \n| title = AGM Plants - Ornamental | date = July 2017 | page = 60 | publisher = Royal Horticultural Society \n| accessdate = 22 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|last=Wiley|first=Leonard|title=Rare Wild Flowers of North America|location=Portland, Oregon|publisher=Wiley|year=1968}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons and category|Lewisiopsis tweedyi}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q6537365}}\n\n[[Category:Montiaceae]]\n[[Category:Monotypic Caryophyllales genera]]\n", "name_user": "WolfmanSF", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewisiopsis"}

It was composed in 1723 and is in twelve [[Movement (music)|movement]]s, scored for five vocal parts (two sopranos, alto, tenor and bass) and a [[Baroque instruments|Baroque orchestra]] of trumpets, timpani, oboes, strings and basso continuo including bassoon. Bach revised the work some ten years later, [[Transposition (music)|transposing]] it from [[E-flat major]] to [[D major]], and creating the version mostly performed today, [[Magnificat (Bach)|BWV 243]].\n\nThe work was first performed in [[Leipzig]] in 1723. In May that year Bach assumed his position as [[Thomaskantor]] and embarked on an ambitious series of compositions. The Magnificat was sung at [[Vespers in Lutheranism|vesper services]] on feast days, and, as suggested by recent research, Bach's setting may have been written for a performance on 2 July, celebrating the [[Marian feast]] of the [[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]]. For a Christmas celebration the same or a later year, he performed it at the [[St. Nicholas Church, Leipzig|Nikolaikirche]] with the insertion of four seasonal movements.\n\nAs a regular part of [[vespers]], the canticle {{lang|la|Magnificat|italic=no}} was [[List of Magnificat composers|often set to music]] for liturgical use. Bach, as some of his contemporaries, devotes individual expression to every verse of the canticle, one even split in two for a dramatic effect. In a carefully designed structure, four choral movements are evenly distributed (1, 4, 7, 11). They frame sets of two or three movements sung by one to three voices, with individual instrumental colour. The work is concluded by a choral [[doxology]] (12), which ends in a [[Recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]] of the beginning on the text \"as it was in the beginning\". In Bach's Leipzig period, Magnificat is the first major work on a Latin text and for five vocal parts. \n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== Bach's beginning in Leipzig ===\n\nBach composed the Magnificat in 1723, his first year as {{lang|de|Thomaskantor}} in Leipzig, music director of the main [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] churches in the city.{{sfn|Gl\u00f6ckner|2003}}{{sfn|Butler|2008|p=53}} He had worked previously as an organist in [[Arnstadt]], [[M\u00fchlhausen]] and [[Weimar]], where he was promoted to ''Konzertmeister'' (director of music) in 1714. From 1717 to 1723 he held a secular position at the court of [[K\u00f6then]].{{sfn|Wolff|1998|p=17}} He applied for the post in Leipzig on 7 February 1723, performing two [[Bach cantata|cantata]]s written for the audition on [[Church cantata (Bach)#Estomihi|Estomihi]] or Quinquagesima, the last Sunday before [[Lent]].{{sfn|Wolff|1998|p=19}} In April he was accepted for the post, which he assumed on the first Sunday after [[Trinity Sunday|Trinity]], presenting a new cantata in 14 [[Movement (music)|movement]], [[Die Elenden sollen essen, BWV 75|''Die Elenden sollen essen'', BWV 75]], on 30 May.{{sfn|Wolff|1991|p=30}} A week later he led the new cantata {{lang|de|[[Die Himmel erz\u00e4hlen die Ehre Gottes, BWV 76|''Die Himmel erz\u00e4hlen die Ehre Gottes'', BWV 76]] |italic=unset}}, again in 14 movements. The feast of the Visitation, celebrated always on 2 July, was a few weeks later the first [[Marian feast]] day of his tenure in Leipzig.{{sfn|Rizzuti|2013|p=1}}\n\n=== Magnificat ===\n\nThe canticle {{lang|la|Magnificat}}, one of three [[New Testament]] canticles, has long been a regular part of the liturgy in daily [[vespers|vesper services]]. After the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], [[Martin Luther]] kept the Magnificat in the liturgy. He provided a German translation of the canticle, \"[[Meine Seele erhebt den Herren]]\" (which Bach used as the basis for his chorale cantata [[Meine Seel erhebt den Herren, BWV 10|''Meine Seel erhebt den Herren'', BWV 10]]). However, the Latin text was also permitted in Lutheran worship. The canticle was often set to music. Contemporary extended settings include works [[List of compositions by Johann David Heinichen#Canticles|by Heinichen]] and [[Magnificat (Vivaldi)|by Vivaldi]].\n\nBach had an audience familiar with the text and its background. In Leipzig, a Latin Magnificat was sung on the high holidays (Christmas, Easter and Pentecost, then performed on two of the three days of celebration) and on the three Marian feasts [[Annunciation]], [[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]] and [[Purification of the Virgin|Purification]].{{sfn|Rizzuti|2013|p=3}}{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=133}}{{sfn|Schr\u00f6der|2012}} According to some scholars, further feast days included [[New Year's Day]], [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]], [[Feast of the Ascension]], [[Trinity Sunday]], [[Nativity of St John the Baptist|St. John's Day]] and [[Michaelmas|St. Michael's Day]], and the vespers before the feast days.{{sfn|Rizzuti|2013|p=3}}\n\n== Composition history ==\n\nBach composed the work in 1723, his first year as {{lang|de|Thomaskantor}} in Leipzig, probably for the [[Church cantata#Visitation (2 July)|feast of the Visitation]].{{sfn|Gl\u00f6ckner|2003}}{{sfn|Butler|2008|p=53}} For the occasion, he presented the Magnificat as his first work on a Latin text and his first five-part choral setting in Leipzig. Otherwise, he used five voices in the funeral [[motet]] {{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude, BWV 227|Jesu, meine Freude]]}}, the [[Bach's Missa of 1733|Missa in B minor]], composed in 1733 for the court of Dresden, from which he derived the derived cantata {{lang|la|[[Gloria in excelsis Deo, BWV 191|''Gloria in excelsis Deo'', BWV 191]]|italic=unset}}, and in the [[Mass in B minor structure|Mass in B minor]]. [[Richard D. P. Jones]] notes: \"Without exception these works lie outside the normal routine of Bach's sacred vocal works\".{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=133}}\n\nBach probably first performed the Magnificat on the feast day, 2 July.{{sfn|BDW 303|2014}} Until 2003, most musicologists believed that Bach wrote the Magnificat for his first Christmas in Leipzig. Then [[Andreas Gl\u00f6ckner]] published ''Bachs Es-Dur-Magnificat BWV 243a \u2013 eine genuine Weihnachtsmusik?'' (Bach's Magnificat in E-flat major, BWV 243a \u2013 a genuine Christmas music?) in the ''[[Bach-Jahrbuch]]'' (Bach yearbook) 89, questioning the Christmas date in favour of Visitation the same year.{{sfn|Rizzuti|2013|p=1}}{{sfn|BDW 303|2014}} Older sources naturally still have Christmas as the first performance, for example Neil Jenkins, the editor of an edition for [[Novello & Co|Novello]] in 2000. He writes that the \"new Thomaskantor was obviously intending to impress his new employer and the congregation\", which makes even more sense at the beginning of Bach's tenure.{{sfn|Jenkins|2000|p=1}} Not all scholars follow Gl\u00f6ckner's arguments, but Jones agrees with Gl\u00f6ckner: \"...&nbsp;may well have received its first performance at the Feast of the Visitation on 2 July 1723, only five weeks after he took up his Leipzig post.\"{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=133}}\n\nFor Christmas the same year, Bach performed his Magnificat with four inserted {{lang|la|laudes}}, songs of praise related to Christmas, partly in German, partly in Latin.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=133}}{{sfn|BDW 303|2014}} In a [[Vespers in Lutheranism|vespers service]] on 25 December 1723, he performed the cantata {{lang|de|[[Christen, \u00e4tzet diesen Tag, BWV 63|''Christen, \u00e4tzet diesen Tag'', BWV 63]] |italic=unset}}, and the Magnificat at the {{lang|de|Nikolaikirche|italic=no}}, on 26 December the cantata {{lang|de|[[Darzu ist erschienen der Sohn Gottes, BWV 40|''Darzu ist erschienen der Sohn Gottes'', BWV 40]] |italic=unset}}, in the [[Thomaskirche]].{{sfn|Schr\u00f6der|2012}}\n\nBach used as a {{lang|la|[[cantus firmus]]}} in movement 10 the [[chant]] associated with Luther's German version of the Magnificat canticle, \"{{lang|de|Meine Seele erhebt den Herren|italic=no}}\". A year later Bach composed for the feast of the Visitation the [[Chorale cantata (Bach)|chorale cantata]] {{lang|de|Meine Seel erhebt den Herren}}, BWV 10, based on the German Magnificat.{{sfn|Rizzuti|2013|p=2}} The musicologist Alberto Rizzuti compared the two settings which were possibly performed in one service on 2 July 1724.{{sfn|Rizzuti|2013|p=1}}\n\nFor Visitation of 1733, Bach revised his Magnificat, creating the [[Magnificat (Bach)|version better known today]]. In that version, transposed to [[D major]], the ''laudes'' interpolations were abandoned. Limited differences in instrumentation include replacing the recorders by flutes and including these in the tutti movements. Changes in musical texture were even smaller, mellowing the harmony near the end of the Omnes generationes movement being the most noticeable.{{sfn|Jenkins|2000|p=3}}{{sfn|Spitta|1899}}\n\nBach's son [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]] followed the example of an extended setting, composing [[Magnificat (C. P. E. Bach)|a Magnificat]] in nine movements in 1749,{{sfn|Carus-Verlag}} at the end of his father's life.\n\n== Music ==\n=== Scoring and structure ===\nBach scored the work festively. The autograph reads: \"J.J. Magnificat \u00e0 3 Trombe Tamburi 2 Hautb. Basson. 2 Violini. Viola 5 Voci \u00e8 Continuo\", translating to: [[Jesu Juva]] (\"Jesus, help!\") / Magnificat for three trumpets, timpani, two oboes, bassoon, two violins, viola, five voices, continuo).{{sfn|Autograph}}{{sfn|Grob|2014}} The five voices are two [[soprano]]s (SI, SII), [[alto]] (A), [[tenor]] (T) and [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] (B)). The instruments of the [[Baroque instruments|Baroque orchestra]] are listed in the first publication by Simrock in 1811 as \"due violini, due oboe, tre trombi, tamburi, basson, viola e basso continuo\",{{sfn|Simrock|1811}} i.e. two [[violin]]s, two [[oboe]]s, three [[trumpet]]s (in E-flat), [[timpani]] (E-flat and B-flat), [[bassoon]], [[viola]] and [[basso continuo]]. Two [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]]s ([[flauto dolce]]) are required for aria No. 9 Esurientes.{{sfn|Jenkins|2000|p=5}}\n\n=== Movements ===\n\nBach structured the text in eleven movements for the canticle (Luke 1:46\u201355), concluded by a twelfth [[doxology]] movement. Each verse of the canticle is assigned to one movement, except verse 48, beginning with a soprano solo in the role of Mary (third movement), then switching to the fourth movement sung by the chorus when \"all generations\" are mentioned. The structure, alternating choral and solo movements, is similar to \"contemporary Italian concerted settings of the Magnificat\".{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=134}} The four Christmas hymn movements are placed after the second, fifth, seventh and ninth movement on the Magnificat text.\n\nChoral movements are evenly distributed in the structure, numbers 1, 4, 7, and 11 within the canticle, and the concluding doxology as movement 12.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=134}} Choral movements 1, 7 and 12 are accompanied by the full orchestra ({{lang|la|tutti}}), with the exceptions of the recorders which add specific colour only in movement 9. The movements for one to three solo voices are accompanied by an [[obbligato]] instrument or only strings or even only continuo, as in Bach's [[Church cantata (Bach)|church cantatas]]. In two consecutive solo movements, the second one is often in richer scoring.{{sfn|BDW 303|2014}}{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=134}} The work contains, other than typical cantatas on Baroque poetry, no [[da capo]] arias.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=134}} Similar to the first two Leipzig cantatas, [[BWV 75]] and [[BWV 76]], it is a complex structure of rather short movements.\n\nThe following table shows the title, voices and instruments, [[Time (music)|time]], [[Key (music)|key]] and text sources for the twelve movements for Visitation and the inserted movements for Christmas. Note that the timpani are no wind instruments but always go with the trumpets. The [[Baroque instruments#Continuo|basso continuo]] is not listed, playing almost throughout. The first Christmas chorale is a four-part setting with no continuo.{{sfn|Grob|2014}} In ''Suscepit Israel'', the lowest line played by violins and viola in [[unison]] has been described as a bassett{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=135}} and an \"unusual continuo\".{{sfn|Rizzuti|2013}} The last column, ''Dig'', provides a link to the Bach Digital database, for more details such as scoring and the text. The Christmas interpolations are highlighted in colour, as are the choral movements, the movements with trumpets, and those movements of the canticle that are in [[major mode]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Movements of Bach's Magnificat in E-flat major (BWV 243a)\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | No.\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Voices\n! scope=\"col\" | Winds\n! scope=\"col\" | Strings\n! scope=\"col\" | Key\n! scope=\"col\" | Time\n! scope=\"col\" | Text source\n! scope=\"col\" | Dig\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#1|1]] || {{lang|la|Magnificat anima mea}} || style=\"background: #F6E3CE;\" | SSATB || style=\"background: #F5F6CE;\" | 3Tr Ti 2Ob || 2Vl Va || style=\"background: #E3F6CE;\" | {{nowrap|[[E-flat major]]}} || 3/4 || {{nowrap|{{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Luke|chapter=1|verse=46}}}} || [http://en.bachdb.com/Works/BWV-243a-Magnificat-Es-Dur/1-Magnificat]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#2|2]] || {{lang|la|Et exultavit spiritus meus}} || SII ||  || 2Vl Va || style=\"background: #E3F6CE;\" | E-flat major || 3/8 || {{nowrap|{{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Luke|chapter=1|verse=47}}}} || [http://en.bachdb.com/Works/BWV-243a-Magnificat-Es-Dur/2-Et-exsultavit-spiritus-meus]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#A|A]] || style=\"background: #E3F6CE;\" | {{lang|de|Vom Himmel hoch}} || SATB || || || E-flat major || {{music|alla-breve}} || Hymn by [[Martin Luther]] || [http://en.bachdb.com/Works/BWV-243a-Magnificat-Es-Dur/3-Vom-Himmel-hoch-da-komm-ich-her]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#3|3]] || {{lang|la|Quia respexit humiltatem}} || SI || Ob || || [[C minor]] || {{music|common-time}} || {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Luke|chapter=1|verse=48}} beginning || [http://en.bachdb.com/Works/BWV-243a-Magnificat-Es-Dur/4-Quia-respexit-humilitatem]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#4|4]] || {{lang|la|Omnes generationes}} || style=\"background: #F6E3CE;\" | SSATB || 2Ob || 2Vl Va || {{nowrap|[[G minor]]}} || {{music|common-time}} || {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Luke|chapter=1|verse=48}} end || [http://en.bachdb.com/Works/BWV-243a-Magnificat-Es-Dur/5-Omnes-generationes]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#5|5]] || {{lang|la|Quia fecit mihi magna}} || B || || || style=\"background: #E3F6CE;\" | {{nowrap|[[B-flat major]]}} || {{music|common-time}} || {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Luke|chapter=1|verse=49}} || [http://en.bachdb.com/Works/BWV-243a-Magnificat-Es-Dur/6-Quia-fecit-mihi-magna]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#B.

The sopranos enter first, in third parallels: they sing the first word \"{{lang|la|Magnificat|italic=no}}\" (literally: makes great) with a [[melisma]] on the first syllable, ending in a figure like a [[Trill (music)|trill]], then a stressed [[Dot (music)|dot]]ted note on the stressed syllable \"gni\", and relaxing on \"ficat\". The motif is abbreviated to a \"fanfare figure\" of just four notes,{{sfn|Hogwood|2011}} a low upbeat followed by three same notes, with the first one dotted. The sopranos sing it twice, reaching first E-flat, then G. The interplay of the fanfare and the melismas shapes the movement.  One measure after the sopranos, alto and tenor begin to imitate the sopranos, another measure later, the bass adds the short motif as an octave up. The text remains {{lang|la|Magnificat|italic=no}} for most of the movement. <!--, the conclusion \"anima mea\" (my soul) is heard by the alto for the first time, in measure 67, embedded in the other voices' {{lang|la|Magnificat}}.--> After the voices conclude with \"{{lang|la|Dominum|italic=no}}\", the instruments close in a shortened version of their opening.\n\n==== 2 ====\n\n'''{{lang|la|Et exultavit spiritus meus}}''' (And my spirit rejoices in God my Saviour){{sfn|Dellal|2012}} is an aria, as an image of personal celebration,{{sfn|Hogwood|2011}} sung by soprano II, accompanied by the strings.{{sfn|Steinberg|2005|p=32}} The major-mode and [[Motif (music)|motif]]s of joy in the instruments illustrate the exultation.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=134}} {{lang|la|Et exultavit}} (And exults) begins with a broken upward triad followed by a rest, suggesting a [[minuet]].{{sfn|Hogwood|2011}} {{lang|la|spiritus meus}} (my spirit) is a sequence of 16th notes, two for every syllable. Longer melismas illustrate {{lang|la|salutari}} (salvation).\n\nA note in the autograph requests the insertion of the first Christmas interpolation here: \"{{lang|la|Alhier folget der Choral: Vom Himmel hoch, da kom ich her}}\" (Here follows the chorale: {{lang|la|[[#A|Vom Himmel hoch, da kom ich her]]}}).{{sfn|Steinberg|2005|p=32}}{{sfn|Grob|2014}}\n\n==== 3 ====\n\n{{lang|la|Quia respexit humiltatem}} (For He has regarded the lowliness [of His handmaiden.]\n{{sfn|Dellal|2012}} is an aria sung by soprano I with an obbligato oboe. Looking at the humility, the aria contrast to the preceding one in slow movement and the [[minor mode]].{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=134}} Hogwood writes: \"Humility is a downwards gesture, and so everything takes a long, s-shaped movement downwards, with a little rise at the end\", and comments that the use of limited resources of one wind instrument and the voice have \"a subservient feel to it.\"{{sfn|Hogwood|2011}} Steinberg comments that voice and instrument first share the material in a \"contemplative duet\", but on {{lang|la|ecce enim ex hoc beatam}} (Behold, from henceforth, I will be called blessed ){{sfn|Dellal|2012}} the voice changes to a \"simpler, more declamatory style\".{{sfn|Steinberg|2005|p=32}} \"All the phrases turn upwards\" in what Hogward describes as \"an internalised dialogue\", expecting that \"nobody in the church would have been expecting the sudden burst of 'omnes'\".{{sfn|Hogwood|2011}}\n\n==== 4 ====\n\nThe continuation of the verse and completion of the sentence, {{lang|la|Omnes generationes}} (by all generations){{sfn|Dellal|2012}} is given to the chorus, expressing the fullness of the praise. Hogwood compares the \"crowd effect\" to Bach's the crowds in Bach's [[Passions (Bach)|Passions]].{{sfn|Hogwood|2011}} The movement is a [[Fugue (music)|fugue]] which follows the stretto principle from the start and throughout.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=134}} Beginning in measure 10, the voices enter, again half a measure apart, with the bass beginning. From measure 15, every entrance is one note higher, covering an octave as a symbol of completeness (omnes), again in the fast succession of half a measure: A, SII, SI, T, B, SII, SI, A. In a final sequence beginning in measure 21, the voices enter from bottom to top on the same note, only one beat apart.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=134}} After a \"very triumphal, but unfinished, chord\" and a general pause, the movement concludes repeating the theme in homophony.{{sfn|Hogwood|2011}} Steinberg comments that Bach took the idea of separating the two words from the rest of the verse from earlier models, but filled it with an \"exciting sense of drama\" by the piled-up entrances in a \"tremendous march across key after key\", leading to \"tense dissonances\", finally a \"dramatic pause\" before the last statement.{{sfn|Steinberg|2005|p=32}}\n\n==== 5 ====\n\n'''{{lang|la|Quia fecit mihi magna qui potens est}}''' (For the Mighty One has done great things for me){{sfn|Dellal|2012}} is an aria sung by the bass, accompanied only by the continuo. The motif, again beginning with repeated notes, is introduced by four measures of the continuo, then repeated by the voice. A [[ritornello]] is repeated throughout the movement,{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=134}} with a downward leap of a sixth and a downward scale of an octave which appears in the voice on the word \"{{lang|la|sanctum|italic=no}}\" (holy), in {{lang|la|et sanctum nomen eius|italic=no}} (and holy is His name).{{sfn|Dellal|2012}} God's might shows in the bass voice and the [[dominant key]] of B-flat major.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=134}}\n\nA note in the autograph requests the insertion of the second Christmas interpolation here: \"{{lang|la|Hierauf folget Freut euch u. jubilirt|italic=no}}\" (Hereon follows {{lang|la|[[#B|Freut euch u. jubilirt]]}}).{{sfn|Grob|2014}}\n\n==== 6 ====\n\n{{lang|la|Et misericordia}} a progenie in progenies, timentibus eum (His mercy is for those who fear Him from generation to generation){{sfn|Dellal|2012}} begins in great contrast softly with undulating movement in 12/8 time, played by the violins. It is a duet of alto and tenor, beginning in parallels of sixths and staying in homophony for most of the movement. The theme resembles the [[sarabande]] of Bach's first [[French Suites (Bach)|French Suite]] in D minor, BWV 812.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=44}} Hogwood compares the music to the pastoral sinfonia beginning [[Christmas Oratorio#Part II|Part II]] of Bach's ''Christmas Oratorio'', \"creating a romantic, soft-edged, almost comforting sound\".{{sfn|Hogwood|2011}} Jones remarks that {{lang|la|timentibus eum}}\" (who fear him) is \"full of pathos and built over a partly chromatic, quasi-ostinato bass\", while the \"divine quality of mercy is expressed in beatific parallel thirds of the violins in the ritornello\".{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=134}}\n\n==== 7 ====\n\n'''{{lang|la|Fecit potentiam}}''' (He has shown strength){{sfn|Dellal|2012}} shares key, scoring and dotted motifs with the first movement. Based on a continuo line of octaves and repeated 16th notes, strength is expressed by irregular coloraturas in one voice and homophonic simultaneous calls of the other voices.{{sfn|Hogwood|2011}} The tenor begins the coloraturas of four measures, followed by alto, SII, bass and SI, leading to the climax of the movement, two homophonic calls. The new text, {{lang|la|dispersit}} (He has scattered),{{sfn|Dellal|2012}} appears in various voices as broken triads, juxtaposed to material from the first section, but then isolated, in a sequence from the highest voice to the lowest and in downward triads. Joes describes: \"...&nbsp;the fugue is dispersed ('dispersit') in favour of a highly graphic, dramatic portrayal of the words 'He has scattered&nbsp;...'\".{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=135}} The conclusion, {{lang|la|mente cordis sui}} (in the thoughts of their hearts),{{sfn|Dellal|2012}} is marked Adagio and illustrates the text in pompous long chords, with accents in the trumpets. Hogwood notes that Bach shows \"complete imagination\" in \"very strange, incomplete yet wonderful harmonies\", the trumpet playing their highest available note as an image of \"rich people's hearts, who have been misled by worldly promises\".{{sfn|Hogwood|2011}}\n\nA note in the autograph requests the insertion of the third Christmas interpolation here: \"{{lang|de|Hierher geh\u00f6ret das}} {{lang|la|Gloria in excelsis Deo|italic=no}}\" (Here belongs the {{lang|la|[[#C|Gloria in excelsis Deo]]}}).{{sfn|Grob|2014}}\n\n==== 8 ====\n\n{{lang|la|Deposuit potentes}} (He has brought down the powerful){{sfn|Dellal|2012}} is an aria for tenor, accompanied by only the violins (and continuo) united in powerful [[unison]]. The instrumental ritornello of 14 measures presents the material. The first motif, later sung on \"{{lang|la|Deposuit|italic=no}}\", begins with a short upbeat and a long note, followed by a straight downward scale{{sfn|Hogwood|2011}} and a final leap up, while the continuo presents a broken triad, straight upward one octave. The second motif, later sung on \"{{lang|la|potentes|italic=no}}\", begins with an upbeat of three 16th, followed by a rhythmic pattern which expands both the lowest as the highest note, while the continuo moves in steady steps down. For the third motif, sung on \"{{lang|la|de sede|italic=no}}\" (from their thrones),{{sfn|Dellal|2012}} the continuo picks up the rhythm of the second motif, while the violins play a more ornamented downward motion in sixteen continuous 16th. A fourth motif is a sequence of three measures, each a sequence of a figure of a figure of four 16th which is slowly moving upwards.{{sfn|Hogwood|2011}} When the singer takes over, the violins accent the end of each motif one to three by a broken downward triad.\n\nThe second thought of the verse, \"{{lang|la|et exaltavit humiles}}\" (and lifted up the lowly),{{sfn|Dellal|2012}} is sung without introduction as a melisma of four measures, which includes downward runs but in a steadily rising sequence and ending similarly to the sequence of motif four, on \"{{lang|la|exaltavit}}\", but a modest downward line on \"{{lang|la|humiles}}\" (the lowly). After a shorter ritornello, the tenor sings the complete text again, the first part in a slightly modified version, but the exaltation considerably expanded. Nonetheless, the ritornello in full length is repeated at the end.\n\n==== 9 ====\n\n{{lang|la|'''Esurientes''' implevit bonis}} (He has filled the hungry with good things){{sfn|Dellal|2012}} is sung by the alto, accompanied by two recorders which may symbolise the need of the hungry. Bach used recorders also in his later cantata {{lang|de|[[Brich dem Hungrigen dein Brot, BWV 39|''Brich dem Hungrigen dein Brot'', BWV 39]] |italic=unset}}.{{sfn|BWV 39}} They often play in parallels of sixths and thirds. The ritornello of eight measures introduces a motif moving up, on a continuo of steady quarter note, for four measures, later sung on {{lang|la|Esurientes implevit bonis}}, while downward lines and a continuo moving in eighth notes later go with {{lang|la|et divites dimisit}} (and sent the rich away empty).{{sfn|Dellal|2012}} In Latin, the last word is {{lang|la|inanes}} (empty), which Bach sometimes separates by rests. The continuo is plucked in \"the emptiest sound\", even on the last note,{{sfn|Hogwood|2011}} on which the recorders are silent.{{sfn|Steinberg|2005|p=33}}\n\nA note in the autograph requests the insertion of the fourth Christmas interpolation here: \"{{lang|de|Hierauf folget}} {{lang|la|Virga Jesse floruit|italic=no}}\" (Hereon follows {{lang|la|[[#D|Virga Jesse floruit]]}}).{{sfn|Grob|2014}}\n\n==== 10 ====\n\n{{lang|la|Suscepit Israel puerum suum}} (He has helped His servant Israel){{sfn|Dellal|2012}} is scored for an unusual combination of the three highest voices, violins and violas in [[unison]] and trumpet. The text continues {{lang|la|recordatus misericordiae suae}} (in remembrance of His mercy).{{sfn|Dellal|2012}} The {{lang|la|[[cantus firmus]]}} played by the trumpet is the melody of the traditional setting of Luther's German version of the Magnificat, a [[tonus peregrinus|ninth psalm tone]] variant.{{sfn|Steinberg|2005|p=33}} The strings, as the only other instruments, play repeated notes in every measure, moving one step down or up in the next. The voices imitate each other, also in gentle movement, the first a fifth up in a long upbeat, the second a fifth down one measure later, the third up again, another measure later, described as \"scale themes\".{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=135}} In contrast, the second idea of the verse, {{lang|la|recordatus}}, is on a \"disjunct theme\".{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=135}} Bach repeats the figure, with a downward quart on each syllable, in the {{lang|la|[[Mass in B minor structure#Et incarnatus est|Et incarnatus est]]}} of his Mass in B minor. It has been interpreted as a symbol of the [[Cross (Christianity)|cross]], because a line drawn from the first to the fourth note crosses one from the second to the third. Jones assumes that the \"bassett\" of the unison strings symbolizes the divine quality of mercy.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=135}}\n\n==== 11 ====\n\n{{lang|la|'''Sicut locutus est''' ad patres nostros}} (According to the promise He made to our ancestors),{{sfn|Dellal|2012}} the last line of the Magnificat canticle, is written in [[Prima pratica|stile antico]], the old style of the musical \"fathers\", as a strict fugue, one voice following the other as one generation follows the other. The theme has four distinctly different measures: the first repeated notes, the second flowing eighth notes, the third quarter notes in leaps, the fourth half notes leaping up a sixth. The countersubject has leaps down and up an octave in the second measure, the flowing eighth notes in the third measure. When the theme is developed the first time, four voices enter from bottom to top. In the second development, soprano I begins, followed by alto, tenor and bass. The movements ends with a more homophonic section in which the bass has the theme once more, while soprano I sings long suspended notes covering almost an octave down. Hogwood sees Bach alluding to his musical \"forefathers\": \"He portrays, in a very square fugue, exactly how square he thought the forefathers of German music were. Four bars follows four bars, each voice coming in predictably and on time, all according to the rulebook, unimaginative and extremely dull!\"{{sfn|Hogwood|2011}}\n\n==== 12 ====\n\nThe work is concluded by the doxology, {{lang|la|Gloria Patri}} (Glory to the Father),{{sfn|Dellal|2012}} performed by the ensemble in two parts. The first part addresses the [[Trinity (Christianity)|Trinity]]. Glory is given three times. Bach shapes the movement again as a \"crowd\" scene.{{sfn|Hogwood|2011}} {{lang|la|Gloria|italic=no}} is first presented as the major chord repeated three times, with a dotted note on the first syllable. In the second {{lang|la|Gloria|italic=no}}, leading to {{lang|la|Patri|italic=no}}, the voices sing the first syllable as an extended melisma in triplets, as another symbol of the Trinity, beginning in upward moving lines, for three measures in the basses, half a measure less for each following voice.{{sfn|Hogwood|2011}} In the third {{lang|la|Gloria|italic=no}}, leading to {{lang|la|Filio|italic=no}} (to the Son),{{sfn|Dellal|2012}} in a similar pattern soprano I begins, followed by alto, soprano II, tenor and bass. In the fourth {{lang|la|Gloria|italic=no}}, leading to {{lang|la|et Spiritui sancto|italic=no}} (and to the Holy Spirit),{{sfn|Dellal|2012}} in again  similar pattern the voices follow each other from top to bottom, ending in a long [[cadenza]].{{sfn|Hogwood|2011}}\n\nThe second part, {{lang|la|Sicut erat in principio}} (as it was in the beginning){{sfn|Dellal|2012}} repeats material from the beginning of the work but shortened, as a frame. Jones points out that the \"wittiness\" of it was already used by [[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]].{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=134}}\n\nJones remarks that Bach observes a pattern of a bipartite structure of firstly contrasting homophonic blocks and \"florid triplet rhythms\", secondly \"a lighter, quicker conclusion in triple time\". He remarks that Bach used a similar pattern again the following year in the {{lang|la|Sanctus}} for Christmas 1724 which later was included as the {{lang|la|[[Mass in B minor structure#Sanctus|Sanctus]]}} of the Mass in B minor.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=136}}\n\n=== The four Christmas interpolations ===\nThe four hymns Bach inserted in the Magnificat for the Christmas vespers had a tradition in Leipzig.{{sfn|Jenkins|2000|p=2}} A setting by Bach's predecessor [[Kuhnau]] in a [[Christmas cantata]] is extant.{{sfn|Cantagrel|2011}}{{sfn|Spitta|1899}} They can be connected to scenic display of the Christmas story, representing the [[annunciation to the shepherds]], first by one angel (A, B), then by the multitude (C), finally a cradle song (''[[Kindleinwiegen]]'', D).{{sfn|Prinz|2013|p=4}} In Bach's autograph, the four movements are grouped at the back of the volume. They are written in older musical styles than most of the Magnificat movements.{{sfn|Jenkins|2000|p=2}}\n\n==== A ====\n{{lang|de|Vom Himmel hoch, da komm ich her}} (From heaven on high I come here){{sfn|Dellal|2012}} is the first stanza of a hymn by [[Martin Luther]], \"{{lang|de|[[Vom Himmel hoch, da komm ich her]]|italic=no}}\", a paraphrase of the [[Annunciation to the shepherds]]. It is set for four parts in E-flat major and alla-breve as an [[a cappella]] motet, with the soprano singing the melody in long notes, the lower voices in imitation of the [[Motif (music)|motif]]s.{{sfn|Steinberg|2005|p=32}}{{sfn|Jenkins|2000|p=2}}\n\n==== B ====\n{{lang|de|Freut euch und jubilieret}} (Rejoice and celebrate){{sfn|Dellal|2012}} is set for SSAT in {{nowrap|[[B-flat major]]}} and common time. In [[polyphony]] on an independent basso continuo, with pairs of voices in parallels, it resembles a setting by [[Sethus Calvisius]], a former ''Thomaskantor''.{{sfn|Jenkins|2000|p=2}}\n\n==== C ====\n{{lang|la|Gloria in excelsis Deo}} (Glory to God in the highest){{sfn|Dellal|2012}} is set for SSATB and violins in E-flat major, on the text from the Christmas story, the [[Annunciation to the Shepherds]] ({{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Luke|chapter=2|verse=14}}). It is written in \"chordal fashion\", a style found in [[Giacomo Carissimi]], [[Johann Schelle]] (also a ''Thomaskantor'') and Kuhnau, among others.{{sfn|Jenkins|2000|p=2}}\n\n==== D ====\n'''{{lang|la|Virga Jesse floruit}}''' (The branch of Jesse flowers){{sfn|Dellal|2012}} is an \"operatic\" duet for soprano and bass{{sfn|Jenkins|2000|p=2}} in F major in 12/8 time. The text is part of a longer hymn, beginning like [[Virga Jesse floruit]]. Only the first 30 measures of this movement are extant.{{sfn|Grob|2014}}{{sfn|Spitta|1899}}  Bach used the music again in 1725 on a different text in his [[Christmas cantata]] [[Unser Mund sei voll Lachens, BWV 110|''Unser Mund sei voll Lachens'', BWV 110]], from which the missing part can be deducted.{{sfn|Steinberg|2005|p=33}} It was [[Alfred D\u00fcrr]] who noticed the similarity of the continuo parts of both pieces.{{sfn|Jenkins|2000|p=4}}\n\n==Reception history==\n{{details|Magnificat (Bach)#Reception history}}\n\n=== Publication ===\n\nThe earliest sources are autographs for the performances on 2 July and 25 December 1723, including the Christmas parts, kept by the [[Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin]].{{sfn|BDW 303|2018}}{{sfn|Autograph}}\n\nThe score of the E-flat major version of Bach's Magnificat was first published by [[N.

It was composed in 1723 and is in twelve [[Movement (music)|movement]]s, scored for five vocal parts (two sopranos, alto, tenor and bass) and a [[Baroque instruments|Baroque orchestra]] of trumpets, timpani, oboes, strings and basso continuo including bassoon. Bach revised the work some ten years later, [[Transposition (music)|transposing]] it from [[E-flat major]] to [[D major]], and creating the version mostly performed today, [[Magnificat (Bach)|BWV 243]].\n\nThe work was first performed in [[Leipzig]] in 1723. In May that year Bach assumed his position as [[Thomaskantor]] and embarked on an ambitious series of compositions. The Magnificat was sung at [[Vespers in Lutheranism|vesper services]] on feast days, and, as suggested by recent research, Bach's setting may have been written for a performance on 2 July, celebrating the [[Marian feast]] of the [[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]]. For a Christmas celebration the same or a later year, he performed it at the [[St. Nicholas Church, Leipzig|Nikolaikirche]] with the insertion of four seasonal movements.\n\nAs a regular part of [[vespers]], the canticle {{lang|la|Magnificat|italic=no}} was [[List of Magnificat composers|often set to music]] for liturgical use. Bach, as some of his contemporaries, devotes individual expression to every verse of the canticle, one even split in two for a dramatic effect. In a carefully designed structure, four choral movements are evenly distributed (1, 4, 7, 11). They frame sets of two or three movements sung by one to three voices, with individual instrumental colour. The work is concluded by a choral [[doxology]] (12), which ends in a [[Recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]] of the beginning on the text \"as it was in the beginning\". In Bach's Leipzig period, Magnificat is the first major work on a Latin text and for five vocal parts. \n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== Bach's beginning in Leipzig ===\n\nBach composed the Magnificat in 1723, his first year as {{lang|de|Thomaskantor}} in Leipzig, music director of the main [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] churches in the city.{{sfn|Gl\u00f6ckner|2003}}{{sfn|Butler|2008|p=53}} He had worked previously as an organist in [[Arnstadt]], [[M\u00fchlhausen]] and [[Weimar]], where he was promoted to ''Konzertmeister'' (director of music) in 1714.

The feast of the Visitation, celebrated always on 2 July, was a few weeks later the first [[Marian feast]] day of his tenure in Leipzig.{{sfn|Rizzuti|2013|p=1}}\n\n=== Magnificat ===\n\nThe canticle {{lang|la|Magnificat}}, one of three [[New Testament]] canticles, has long been a regular part of the liturgy in daily [[vespers|vesper services]]. After the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], [[Martin Luther]] kept the Magnificat in the liturgy. He provided a German translation of the canticle, \"[[Meine Seele erhebt den Herren]]\" (which Bach used as the basis for his chorale cantata [[Meine Seel erhebt den Herren, BWV 10|''Meine Seel erhebt den Herren'', BWV 10]]). However, the Latin text was also permitted in Lutheran worship. The canticle was often set to music. Contemporary extended settings include works [[List of compositions by Johann David Heinichen#Canticles|by Heinichen]] and [[Magnificat (Vivaldi)|by Vivaldi]].\n\nBach had an audience familiar with the text and its background. In Leipzig, a Latin Magnificat was sung on the high holidays (Christmas, Easter and Pentecost, then performed on two of the three days of celebration) and on the three Marian feasts [[Annunciation]], [[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]] and [[Purification of the Virgin|Purification]].{{sfn|Rizzuti|2013|p=3}}{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=133}}{{sfn|Schr\u00f6der|2012}} According to some scholars, further feast days included [[New Year's Day]], [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]], [[Feast of the Ascension]], [[Trinity Sunday]], [[Nativity of St John the Baptist|St. John's Day]] and [[Michaelmas|St. Michael's Day]], and the vespers before the feast days.{{sfn|Rizzuti|2013|p=3}}\n\n== Composition history ==\n\nBach composed the work in 1723, his first year as {{lang|de|Thomaskantor}} in Leipzig, probably for the [[Church cantata#Visitation (2 July)|feast of the Visitation]].{{sfn|Gl\u00f6ckner|2003}}{{sfn|Butler|2008|p=53}} For the occasion, he presented the Magnificat as his first work on a Latin text and his first five-part choral setting in Leipzig. Otherwise, he used five voices in the funeral [[motet]] {{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude, BWV 227|Jesu, meine Freude]]}}, the [[Missa, BWV 232a|Missa in B minor]], composed in 1733 for the court of Dresden, from which he derived the derived cantata {{lang|la|[[Gloria in excelsis Deo, BWV 191|''Gloria in excelsis Deo'', BWV 191]]|italic=unset}}, and in the [[Mass in B minor structure|Mass in B minor]]. [[Richard D. P. Jones]] notes: \"Without exception these works lie outside the normal routine of Bach's sacred vocal works\".{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=133}}\n\nBach probably first performed the Magnificat on the feast day, 2 July.{{sfn|BDW 303|2014}} Until 2003, most musicologists believed that Bach wrote the Magnificat for his first Christmas in Leipzig. Then [[Andreas Gl\u00f6ckner]] published ''Bachs Es-Dur-Magnificat BWV 243a \u2013 eine genuine Weihnachtsmusik?'' (Bach's Magnificat in E-flat major, BWV 243a \u2013 a genuine Christmas music?) in the ''[[Bach-Jahrbuch]]'' (Bach yearbook) 89, questioning the Christmas date in favour of Visitation the same year.{{sfn|Rizzuti|2013|p=1}}{{sfn|BDW 303|2014}} Older sources naturally still have Christmas as the first performance, for example Neil Jenkins, the editor of an edition for [[Novello & Co|Novello]] in 2000. He writes that the \"new Thomaskantor was obviously intending to impress his new employer and the congregation\", which makes even more sense at the beginning of Bach's tenure.{{sfn|Jenkins|2000|p=1}} Not all scholars follow Gl\u00f6ckner's arguments, but Jones agrees with Gl\u00f6ckner: \"...&nbsp;may well have received its first performance at the Feast of the Visitation on 2 July 1723, only five weeks after he took up his Leipzig post.\"{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=133}}\n\nFor Christmas the same year, Bach performed his Magnificat with four inserted {{lang|la|laudes}}, songs of praise related to Christmas, partly in German, partly in Latin.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=133}}{{sfn|BDW 303|2014}} In a [[Vespers in Lutheranism|vespers service]] on 25 December 1723, he performed the cantata {{lang|de|[[Christen, \u00e4tzet diesen Tag, BWV 63|''Christen, \u00e4tzet diesen Tag'', BWV 63]] |italic=unset}}, and the Magnificat at the {{lang|de|Nikolaikirche|italic=no}}, on 26 December the cantata {{lang|de|[[Darzu ist erschienen der Sohn Gottes, BWV 40|''Darzu ist erschienen der Sohn Gottes'', BWV 40]] |italic=unset}}, in the [[Thomaskirche]].{{sfn|Schr\u00f6der|2012}}\n\nBach used as a {{lang|la|[[cantus firmus]]}} in movement 10 the [[chant]] associated with Luther's German version of the Magnificat canticle, \"{{lang|de|Meine Seele erhebt den Herren|italic=no}}\". A year later Bach composed for the feast of the Visitation the [[Chorale cantata (Bach)|chorale cantata]] {{lang|de|Meine Seel erhebt den Herren}}, BWV 10, based on the German Magnificat.{{sfn|Rizzuti|2013|p=2}} The musicologist Alberto Rizzuti compared the two settings which were possibly performed in one service on 2 July 1724.{{sfn|Rizzuti|2013|p=1}}\n\nFor Visitation of 1733, Bach revised his Magnificat, creating the [[Magnificat (Bach)|version better known today]]. In that version, transposed to [[D major]], the ''laudes'' interpolations were abandoned. Limited differences in instrumentation include replacing the recorders by flutes and including these in the tutti movements. Changes in musical texture were even smaller, mellowing the harmony near the end of the Omnes generationes movement being the most noticeable.{{sfn|Jenkins|2000|p=3}}{{sfn|Spitta|1899}}\n\nBach's son [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]] followed the example of an extended setting, composing [[Magnificat (C. P. E. Bach)|a Magnificat]] in nine movements in 1749,{{sfn|Carus-Verlag}} at the end of his father's life.\n\n== Music ==\n=== Scoring and structure ===\nBach scored the work festively. The autograph reads: \"J.J. Magnificat \u00e0 3 Trombe Tamburi 2 Hautb. Basson. 2 Violini. Viola 5 Voci \u00e8 Continuo\", translating to: [[Jesu Juva]] (\"Jesus, help!\") / Magnificat for three trumpets, timpani, two oboes, bassoon, two violins, viola, five voices, continuo).{{sfn|Autograph}}{{sfn|Grob|2014}} The five voices are two [[soprano]]s (SI, SII), [[alto]] (A), [[tenor]] (T) and [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] (B)). The instruments of the [[Baroque instruments|Baroque orchestra]] are listed in the first publication by Simrock in 1811 as \"due violini, due oboe, tre trombi, tamburi, basson, viola e basso continuo\",{{sfn|Simrock|1811}} i.e. two [[violin]]s, two [[oboe]]s, three [[trumpet]]s (in E-flat), [[timpani]] (E-flat and B-flat), [[bassoon]], [[viola]] and [[basso continuo]]. Two [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]]s ([[flauto dolce]]) are required for aria No. 9 Esurientes.{{sfn|Jenkins|2000|p=5}}\n\n=== Movements ===\n\nBach structured the text in eleven movements for the canticle (Luke 1:46\u201355), concluded by a twelfth [[doxology]] movement. Each verse of the canticle is assigned to one movement, except verse 48, beginning with a soprano solo in the role of Mary (third movement), then switching to the fourth movement sung by the chorus when \"all generations\" are mentioned. The structure, alternating choral and solo movements, is similar to \"contemporary Italian concerted settings of the Magnificat\".{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=134}} The four Christmas hymn movements are placed after the second, fifth, seventh and ninth movement on the Magnificat text.\n\nChoral movements are evenly distributed in the structure, numbers 1, 4, 7, and 11 within the canticle, and the concluding doxology as movement 12.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=134}} Choral movements 1, 7 and 12 are accompanied by the full orchestra ({{lang|la|tutti}}), with the exceptions of the recorders which add specific colour only in movement 9. The movements for one to three solo voices are accompanied by an [[obbligato]] instrument or only strings or even only continuo, as in Bach's [[Church cantata (Bach)|church cantatas]]. In two consecutive solo movements, the second one is often in richer scoring.{{sfn|BDW 303|2014}}{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=134}} The work contains, other than typical cantatas on Baroque poetry, no [[da capo]] arias.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=134}} Similar to the first two Leipzig cantatas, [[BWV 75]] and [[BWV 76]], it is a complex structure of rather short movements.\n\nThe following table shows the title, voices and instruments, [[Time (music)|time]], [[Key (music)|key]] and text sources for the twelve movements for Visitation and the inserted movements for Christmas. Note that the timpani are no wind instruments but always go with the trumpets. The [[Baroque instruments#Continuo|basso continuo]] is not listed, playing almost throughout. The first Christmas chorale is a four-part setting with no continuo.{{sfn|Grob|2014}} In ''Suscepit Israel'', the lowest line played by violins and viola in [[unison]] has been described as a bassett{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=135}} and an \"unusual continuo\".{{sfn|Rizzuti|2013}} The last column, ''Dig'', provides a link to the Bach Digital database, for more details such as scoring and the text. The Christmas interpolations are highlighted in colour, as are the choral movements, the movements with trumpets, and those movements of the canticle that are in [[major mode]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Movements of Bach's Magnificat in E-flat major (BWV 243a)\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | No.\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Voices\n! scope=\"col\" | Winds\n! scope=\"col\" | Strings\n! scope=\"col\" | Key\n! scope=\"col\" | Time\n! scope=\"col\" | Text source\n! scope=\"col\" | Dig\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#1|1]] || {{lang|la|Magnificat anima mea}} || style=\"background: #F6E3CE;\" | SSATB || style=\"background: #F5F6CE;\" | 3Tr Ti 2Ob || 2Vl Va || style=\"background: #E3F6CE;\" | {{nowrap|[[E-flat major]]}} || 3/4 || {{nowrap|{{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Luke|chapter=1|verse=46}}}} || [http://en.bachdb.com/Works/BWV-243a-Magnificat-Es-Dur/1-Magnificat]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#2|2]] || {{lang|la|Et exultavit spiritus meus}} || SII ||  || 2Vl Va || style=\"background: #E3F6CE;\" | E-flat major || 3/8 || {{nowrap|{{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Luke|chapter=1|verse=47}}}} || [http://en.bachdb.com/Works/BWV-243a-Magnificat-Es-Dur/2-Et-exsultavit-spiritus-meus]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#A|A]] || style=\"background: #E3F6CE;\" | {{lang|de|Vom Himmel hoch}} || SATB || || || E-flat major || {{music|alla-breve}} || Hymn by [[Martin Luther]] || [http://en.bachdb.com/Works/BWV-243a-Magnificat-Es-Dur/3-Vom-Himmel-hoch-da-komm-ich-her]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#3|3]] || {{lang|la|Quia respexit humiltatem}} || SI || Ob || || [[C minor]] || {{music|common-time}} || {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Luke|chapter=1|verse=48}} beginning || [http://en.bachdb.com/Works/BWV-243a-Magnificat-Es-Dur/4-Quia-respexit-humilitatem]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#4|4]] || {{lang|la|Omnes generationes}} || style=\"background: #F6E3CE;\" | SSATB || 2Ob || 2Vl Va || {{nowrap|[[G minor]]}} || {{music|common-time}} || {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Luke|chapter=1|verse=48}} end || [http://en.bachdb.com/Works/BWV-243a-Magnificat-Es-Dur/5-Omnes-generationes]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#5|5]] || {{lang|la|Quia fecit mihi magna}} || B || || || style=\"background: #E3F6CE;\" | {{nowrap|[[B-flat major]]}} || {{music|common-time}} || {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Luke|chapter=1|verse=49}} || [http://en.bachdb.com/Works/BWV-243a-Magnificat-Es-Dur/6-Quia-fecit-mihi-magna]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#B.

The sopranos enter first, in third parallels: they sing the first word \"{{lang|la|Magnificat|italic=no}}\" (literally: makes great) with a [[melisma]] on the first syllable, ending in a figure like a [[Trill (music)|trill]], then a stressed [[Dot (music)|dot]]ted note on the stressed syllable \"gni\", and relaxing on \"ficat\". The motif is abbreviated to a \"fanfare figure\" of just four notes,{{sfn|Hogwood|2011}} a low upbeat followed by three same notes, with the first one dotted. The sopranos sing it twice, reaching first E-flat, then G. The interplay of the fanfare and the melismas shapes the movement.  One measure after the sopranos, alto and tenor begin to imitate the sopranos, another measure later, the bass adds the short motif as an octave up. The text remains {{lang|la|Magnificat|italic=no}} for most of the movement. <!--, the conclusion \"anima mea\" (my soul) is heard by the alto for the first time, in measure 67, embedded in the other voices' {{lang|la|Magnificat}}.--> After the voices conclude with \"{{lang|la|Dominum|italic=no}}\", the instruments close in a shortened version of their opening.\n\n==== 2 ====\n\n'''{{lang|la|Et exultavit spiritus meus}}''' (And my spirit rejoices in God my Saviour){{sfn|Dellal|2012}} is an aria, as an image of personal celebration,{{sfn|Hogwood|2011}} sung by soprano II, accompanied by the strings.{{sfn|Steinberg|2005|p=32}} The major-mode and [[Motif (music)|motif]]s of joy in the instruments illustrate the exultation.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=134}} {{lang|la|Et exultavit}} (And exults) begins with a broken upward triad followed by a rest, suggesting a [[minuet]].{{sfn|Hogwood|2011}} {{lang|la|spiritus meus}} (my spirit) is a sequence of 16th notes, two for every syllable. Longer melismas illustrate {{lang|la|salutari}} (salvation).\n\nA note in the autograph requests the insertion of the first Christmas interpolation here: \"{{lang|la|Alhier folget der Choral: Vom Himmel hoch, da kom ich her}}\" (Here follows the chorale: {{lang|la|[[#A|Vom Himmel hoch, da kom ich her]]}}).{{sfn|Steinberg|2005|p=32}}{{sfn|Grob|2014}}\n\n==== 3 ====\n\n{{lang|la|Quia respexit humiltatem}} (For He has regarded the lowliness [of His handmaiden.]\n{{sfn|Dellal|2012}} is an aria sung by soprano I with an obbligato oboe. Looking at the humility, the aria contrast to the preceding one in slow movement and the [[minor mode]].{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=134}} Hogwood writes: \"Humility is a downwards gesture, and so everything takes a long, s-shaped movement downwards, with a little rise at the end\", and comments that the use of limited resources of one wind instrument and the voice have \"a subservient feel to it.\"{{sfn|Hogwood|2011}} Steinberg comments that voice and instrument first share the material in a \"contemplative duet\", but on {{lang|la|ecce enim ex hoc beatam}} (Behold, from henceforth, I will be called blessed ){{sfn|Dellal|2012}} the voice changes to a \"simpler, more declamatory style\".{{sfn|Steinberg|2005|p=32}} \"All the phrases turn upwards\" in what Hogward describes as \"an internalised dialogue\", expecting that \"nobody in the church would have been expecting the sudden burst of 'omnes'\".{{sfn|Hogwood|2011}}\n\n==== 4 ====\n\nThe continuation of the verse and completion of the sentence, {{lang|la|Omnes generationes}} (by all generations){{sfn|Dellal|2012}} is given to the chorus, expressing the fullness of the praise. Hogwood compares the \"crowd effect\" to Bach's the crowds in Bach's [[Passions (Bach)|Passions]].{{sfn|Hogwood|2011}} The movement is a [[Fugue (music)|fugue]] which follows the stretto principle from the start and throughout.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=134}} Beginning in measure 10, the voices enter, again half a measure apart, with the bass beginning. From measure 15, every entrance is one note higher, covering an octave as a symbol of completeness (omnes), again in the fast succession of half a measure: A, SII, SI, T, B, SII, SI, A. In a final sequence beginning in measure 21, the voices enter from bottom to top on the same note, only one beat apart.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=134}} After a \"very triumphal, but unfinished, chord\" and a general pause, the movement concludes repeating the theme in homophony.{{sfn|Hogwood|2011}} Steinberg comments that Bach took the idea of separating the two words from the rest of the verse from earlier models, but filled it with an \"exciting sense of drama\" by the piled-up entrances in a \"tremendous march across key after key\", leading to \"tense dissonances\", finally a \"dramatic pause\" before the last statement.{{sfn|Steinberg|2005|p=32}}\n\n==== 5 ====\n\n'''{{lang|la|Quia fecit mihi magna qui potens est}}''' (For the Mighty One has done great things for me){{sfn|Dellal|2012}} is an aria sung by the bass, accompanied only by the continuo. The motif, again beginning with repeated notes, is introduced by four measures of the continuo, then repeated by the voice. A [[ritornello]] is repeated throughout the movement,{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=134}} with a downward leap of a sixth and a downward scale of an octave which appears in the voice on the word \"{{lang|la|sanctum|italic=no}}\" (holy), in {{lang|la|et sanctum nomen eius|italic=no}} (and holy is His name).{{sfn|Dellal|2012}} God's might shows in the bass voice and the [[dominant key]] of B-flat major.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=134}}\n\nA note in the autograph requests the insertion of the second Christmas interpolation here: \"{{lang|la|Hierauf folget Freut euch u. jubilirt|italic=no}}\" (Hereon follows {{lang|la|[[#B|Freut euch u. jubilirt]]}}).{{sfn|Grob|2014}}\n\n==== 6 ====\n\n{{lang|la|Et misericordia}} a progenie in progenies, timentibus eum (His mercy is for those who fear Him from generation to generation){{sfn|Dellal|2012}} begins in great contrast softly with undulating movement in 12/8 time, played by the violins. It is a duet of alto and tenor, beginning in parallels of sixths and staying in homophony for most of the movement. The theme resembles the [[sarabande]] of Bach's first [[French Suites (Bach)|French Suite]] in D minor, BWV 812.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=44}} Hogwood compares the music to the pastoral sinfonia beginning [[Christmas Oratorio#Part II|Part II]] of Bach's ''Christmas Oratorio'', \"creating a romantic, soft-edged, almost comforting sound\".{{sfn|Hogwood|2011}} Jones remarks that {{lang|la|timentibus eum}}\" (who fear him) is \"full of pathos and built over a partly chromatic, quasi-ostinato bass\", while the \"divine quality of mercy is expressed in beatific parallel thirds of the violins in the ritornello\".{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=134}}\n\n==== 7 ====\n\n'''{{lang|la|Fecit potentiam}}''' (He has shown strength){{sfn|Dellal|2012}} shares key, scoring and dotted motifs with the first movement. Based on a continuo line of octaves and repeated 16th notes, strength is expressed by irregular coloraturas in one voice and homophonic simultaneous calls of the other voices.{{sfn|Hogwood|2011}} The tenor begins the coloraturas of four measures, followed by alto, SII, bass and SI, leading to the climax of the movement, two homophonic calls. The new text, {{lang|la|dispersit}} (He has scattered),{{sfn|Dellal|2012}} appears in various voices as broken triads, juxtaposed to material from the first section, but then isolated, in a sequence from the highest voice to the lowest and in downward triads. Joes describes: \"...&nbsp;the fugue is dispersed ('dispersit') in favour of a highly graphic, dramatic portrayal of the words 'He has scattered&nbsp;...'\".{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=135}} The conclusion, {{lang|la|mente cordis sui}} (in the thoughts of their hearts),{{sfn|Dellal|2012}} is marked Adagio and illustrates the text in pompous long chords, with accents in the trumpets. Hogwood notes that Bach shows \"complete imagination\" in \"very strange, incomplete yet wonderful harmonies\", the trumpet playing their highest available note as an image of \"rich people's hearts, who have been misled by worldly promises\".{{sfn|Hogwood|2011}}\n\nA note in the autograph requests the insertion of the third Christmas interpolation here: \"{{lang|de|Hierher geh\u00f6ret das}} {{lang|la|Gloria in excelsis Deo|italic=no}}\" (Here belongs the {{lang|la|[[#C|Gloria in excelsis Deo]]}}).{{sfn|Grob|2014}}\n\n==== 8 ====\n\n{{lang|la|Deposuit potentes}} (He has brought down the powerful){{sfn|Dellal|2012}} is an aria for tenor, accompanied by only the violins (and continuo) united in powerful [[unison]]. The instrumental ritornello of 14 measures presents the material. The first motif, later sung on \"{{lang|la|Deposuit|italic=no}}\", begins with a short upbeat and a long note, followed by a straight downward scale{{sfn|Hogwood|2011}} and a final leap up, while the continuo presents a broken triad, straight upward one octave. The second motif, later sung on \"{{lang|la|potentes|italic=no}}\", begins with an upbeat of three 16th, followed by a rhythmic pattern which expands both the lowest as the highest note, while the continuo moves in steady steps down. For the third motif, sung on \"{{lang|la|de sede|italic=no}}\" (from their thrones),{{sfn|Dellal|2012}} the continuo picks up the rhythm of the second motif, while the violins play a more ornamented downward motion in sixteen continuous 16th. A fourth motif is a sequence of three measures, each a sequence of a figure of a figure of four 16th which is slowly moving upwards.{{sfn|Hogwood|2011}} When the singer takes over, the violins accent the end of each motif one to three by a broken downward triad.\n\nThe second thought of the verse, \"{{lang|la|et exaltavit humiles}}\" (and lifted up the lowly),{{sfn|Dellal|2012}} is sung without introduction as a melisma of four measures, which includes downward runs but in a steadily rising sequence and ending similarly to the sequence of motif four, on \"{{lang|la|exaltavit}}\", but a modest downward line on \"{{lang|la|humiles}}\" (the lowly). After a shorter ritornello, the tenor sings the complete text again, the first part in a slightly modified version, but the exaltation considerably expanded. Nonetheless, the ritornello in full length is repeated at the end.\n\n==== 9 ====\n\n{{lang|la|'''Esurientes''' implevit bonis}} (He has filled the hungry with good things){{sfn|Dellal|2012}} is sung by the alto, accompanied by two recorders which may symbolise the need of the hungry. Bach used recorders also in his later cantata {{lang|de|[[Brich dem Hungrigen dein Brot, BWV 39|''Brich dem Hungrigen dein Brot'', BWV 39]] |italic=unset}}.{{sfn|BWV 39}} They often play in parallels of sixths and thirds. The ritornello of eight measures introduces a motif moving up, on a continuo of steady quarter note, for four measures, later sung on {{lang|la|Esurientes implevit bonis}}, while downward lines and a continuo moving in eighth notes later go with {{lang|la|et divites dimisit}} (and sent the rich away empty).{{sfn|Dellal|2012}} In Latin, the last word is {{lang|la|inanes}} (empty), which Bach sometimes separates by rests. The continuo is plucked in \"the emptiest sound\", even on the last note,{{sfn|Hogwood|2011}} on which the recorders are silent.{{sfn|Steinberg|2005|p=33}}\n\nA note in the autograph requests the insertion of the fourth Christmas interpolation here: \"{{lang|de|Hierauf folget}} {{lang|la|Virga Jesse floruit|italic=no}}\" (Hereon follows {{lang|la|[[#D|Virga Jesse floruit]]}}).{{sfn|Grob|2014}}\n\n==== 10 ====\n\n{{lang|la|Suscepit Israel puerum suum}} (He has helped His servant Israel){{sfn|Dellal|2012}} is scored for an unusual combination of the three highest voices, violins and violas in [[unison]] and trumpet. The text continues {{lang|la|recordatus misericordiae suae}} (in remembrance of His mercy).{{sfn|Dellal|2012}} The {{lang|la|[[cantus firmus]]}} played by the trumpet is the melody of the traditional setting of Luther's German version of the Magnificat, a [[tonus peregrinus|ninth psalm tone]] variant.{{sfn|Steinberg|2005|p=33}} The strings, as the only other instruments, play repeated notes in every measure, moving one step down or up in the next. The voices imitate each other, also in gentle movement, the first a fifth up in a long upbeat, the second a fifth down one measure later, the third up again, another measure later, described as \"scale themes\".{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=135}} In contrast, the second idea of the verse, {{lang|la|recordatus}}, is on a \"disjunct theme\".{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=135}} Bach repeats the figure, with a downward quart on each syllable, in the {{lang|la|[[Mass in B minor structure#Et incarnatus est|Et incarnatus est]]}} of his Mass in B minor. It has been interpreted as a symbol of the [[Cross (Christianity)|cross]], because a line drawn from the first to the fourth note crosses one from the second to the third. Jones assumes that the \"bassett\" of the unison strings symbolizes the divine quality of mercy.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=135}}\n\n==== 11 ====\n\n{{lang|la|'''Sicut locutus est''' ad patres nostros}} (According to the promise He made to our ancestors),{{sfn|Dellal|2012}} the last line of the Magnificat canticle, is written in [[Prima pratica|stile antico]], the old style of the musical \"fathers\", as a strict fugue, one voice following the other as one generation follows the other. The theme has four distinctly different measures: the first repeated notes, the second flowing eighth notes, the third quarter notes in leaps, the fourth half notes leaping up a sixth. The countersubject has leaps down and up an octave in the second measure, the flowing eighth notes in the third measure. When the theme is developed the first time, four voices enter from bottom to top. In the second development, soprano I begins, followed by alto, tenor and bass. The movements ends with a more homophonic section in which the bass has the theme once more, while soprano I sings long suspended notes covering almost an octave down. Hogwood sees Bach alluding to his musical \"forefathers\": \"He portrays, in a very square fugue, exactly how square he thought the forefathers of German music were. Four bars follows four bars, each voice coming in predictably and on time, all according to the rulebook, unimaginative and extremely dull!\"{{sfn|Hogwood|2011}}\n\n==== 12 ====\n\nThe work is concluded by the doxology, {{lang|la|Gloria Patri}} (Glory to the Father),{{sfn|Dellal|2012}} performed by the ensemble in two parts. The first part addresses the [[Trinity (Christianity)|Trinity]]. Glory is given three times. Bach shapes the movement again as a \"crowd\" scene.{{sfn|Hogwood|2011}} {{lang|la|Gloria|italic=no}} is first presented as the major chord repeated three times, with a dotted note on the first syllable. In the second {{lang|la|Gloria|italic=no}}, leading to {{lang|la|Patri|italic=no}}, the voices sing the first syllable as an extended melisma in triplets, as another symbol of the Trinity, beginning in upward moving lines, for three measures in the basses, half a measure less for each following voice.{{sfn|Hogwood|2011}} In the third {{lang|la|Gloria|italic=no}}, leading to {{lang|la|Filio|italic=no}} (to the Son),{{sfn|Dellal|2012}} in a similar pattern soprano I begins, followed by alto, soprano II, tenor and bass. In the fourth {{lang|la|Gloria|italic=no}}, leading to {{lang|la|et Spiritui sancto|italic=no}} (and to the Holy Spirit),{{sfn|Dellal|2012}} in again  similar pattern the voices follow each other from top to bottom, ending in a long [[cadenza]].{{sfn|Hogwood|2011}}\n\nThe second part, {{lang|la|Sicut erat in principio}} (as it was in the beginning){{sfn|Dellal|2012}} repeats material from the beginning of the work but shortened, as a frame. Jones points out that the \"wittiness\" of it was already used by [[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]].{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=134}}\n\nJones remarks that Bach observes a pattern of a bipartite structure of firstly contrasting homophonic blocks and \"florid triplet rhythms\", secondly \"a lighter, quicker conclusion in triple time\". He remarks that Bach used a similar pattern again the following year in the {{lang|la|Sanctus}} for Christmas 1724 which later was included as the {{lang|la|[[Mass in B minor structure#Sanctus|Sanctus]]}} of the Mass in B minor.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=136}}\n\n=== The four Christmas interpolations ===\nThe four hymns Bach inserted in the Magnificat for the Christmas vespers had a tradition in Leipzig.{{sfn|Jenkins|2000|p=2}} A setting by Bach's predecessor [[Kuhnau]] in a [[Christmas cantata]] is extant.{{sfn|Cantagrel|2011}}{{sfn|Spitta|1899}} They can be connected to scenic display of the Christmas story, representing the [[annunciation to the shepherds]], first by one angel (A, B), then by the multitude (C), finally a cradle song (''[[Kindleinwiegen]]'', D).{{sfn|Prinz|2013|p=4}} In Bach's autograph, the four movements are grouped at the back of the volume. They are written in older musical styles than most of the Magnificat movements.{{sfn|Jenkins|2000|p=2}}\n\n==== A ====\n{{lang|de|Vom Himmel hoch, da komm ich her}} (From heaven on high I come here){{sfn|Dellal|2012}} is the first stanza of a hymn by [[Martin Luther]], \"{{lang|de|[[Vom Himmel hoch, da komm ich her]]|italic=no}}\", a paraphrase of the [[Annunciation to the shepherds]]. It is set for four parts in E-flat major and alla-breve as an [[a cappella]] motet, with the soprano singing the melody in long notes, the lower voices in imitation of the [[Motif (music)|motif]]s.{{sfn|Steinberg|2005|p=32}}{{sfn|Jenkins|2000|p=2}}\n\n==== B ====\n{{lang|de|Freut euch und jubilieret}} (Rejoice and celebrate){{sfn|Dellal|2012}} is set for SSAT in {{nowrap|[[B-flat major]]}} and common time. In [[polyphony]] on an independent basso continuo, with pairs of voices in parallels, it resembles a setting by [[Sethus Calvisius]], a former ''Thomaskantor''.{{sfn|Jenkins|2000|p=2}}\n\n==== C ====\n{{lang|la|Gloria in excelsis Deo}} (Glory to God in the highest){{sfn|Dellal|2012}} is set for SSATB and violins in E-flat major, on the text from the Christmas story, the [[Annunciation to the Shepherds]] ({{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Luke|chapter=2|verse=14}}). It is written in \"chordal fashion\", a style found in [[Giacomo Carissimi]], [[Johann Schelle]] (also a ''Thomaskantor'') and Kuhnau, among others.{{sfn|Jenkins|2000|p=2}}\n\n==== D ====\n'''{{lang|la|Virga Jesse floruit}}''' (The branch of Jesse flowers){{sfn|Dellal|2012}} is an \"operatic\" duet for soprano and bass{{sfn|Jenkins|2000|p=2}} in F major in 12/8 time. The text is part of a longer hymn, beginning like [[Virga Jesse floruit]]. Only the first 30 measures of this movement are extant.{{sfn|Grob|2014}}{{sfn|Spitta|1899}}  Bach used the music again in 1725 on a different text in his [[Christmas cantata]] [[Unser Mund sei voll Lachens, BWV 110|''Unser Mund sei voll Lachens'', BWV 110]], from which the missing part can be deducted.{{sfn|Steinberg|2005|p=33}} It was [[Alfred D\u00fcrr]] who noticed the similarity of the continuo parts of both pieces.{{sfn|Jenkins|2000|p=4}}\n\n==Reception history==\n{{details|Magnificat (Bach)#Reception history}}\n\n=== Publication ===\n\nThe earliest sources are autographs for the performances on 2 July and 25 December 1723, including the Christmas parts, kept by the [[Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin]].{{sfn|BDW 303|2018}}{{sfn|Autograph}}\n\nThe score of the E-flat major version of Bach's Magnificat was first published by [[N.

The soloists are listed in the table in the order [[SATB]]. For some recordings, only one soprano soloist is listed.

There are several ways being proposed today to make nanosensors; these include [[Top-down and bottom-up design#top-down lithography, bottom-up assembly|top-down lithography, bottom-up assembly]], and [[molecular self-assembly]].<ref name=\"F1\">{{cite book |author=Foster LE |title=Medical Nanotechnology: Science, Innovation, and Opportunity |place=Upper Saddle River |publisher=Pearson Education |isbn=0-13-192756-6 |date=2006 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/nanotechnologysc0000fost }}</ref> There are different types of nanosensors in the market and in development for various applications. Though all sensors measure different things, sensors share the same basic workflow: a selective binding of an analyte, signal generation from the interaction of the nanosensor with the bio-element, and processing of the signal into useful metrics.\n\n== Characteristics ==\nNanomaterials-based sensors have several benefits in [[sensitivity and specificity]] over sensors made from traditional materials. Nanosensors can have increased specificity because they operate at a similar scale as natural biological processes, allowing functionalization with chemical and biological molecules, with recognition events that cause detectable physical changes. Enhancements in sensitivity stem from the high surface-to-volume ratio of nanomaterials, as well as novel physical properties of nanomaterials that can be used as the basis for detection, including [[nanophotonics]]. Nanosensors can also potentially be integrated with [[nanoelectronics]] to add native processing capability to the nanosensor.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nano.gov/node/100|title=Nanotechnology-Enabled Sensing|date=2009|website=National Nanotechnology Initiative|access-date=2017-06-22}}</ref>{{Rp|4\u201310}}\n\nIn addition to their sensitivity and specificity, nanosensors offer significant advantages in cost and response times, which makes nanosensors suitable for high-throughput applications.  Nanosensors provide real-time monitoring compared to traditional detection methods such as chromatography and spectroscopy.

A principle of operation of these sensors is based on the chemical modulation of a hydrogel film volume that incorporates a Bragg grating.

The diffracted light can be correlated with the concentration of a target analyte.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Yetisen | first1 = AK | last2 = Montelongo | first2 = Y | last3 = Vasconcellos | first3 = FC | last4 = Martinez-Hurtado | first4 = JL | last5 = Neupane | first5 = S | last6 = Butt | first6 = H | last7 = Qasim | first7 = MM | last8 = Blyth | first8 = J | last9 = Burling | first9 = K | last10 = Carmody | first10 = JB | last11 = Evans | first11 = M | last12 = Wilkinson | first12 = TD | last13 = Kubota | first13 = LT | last14 = Monteiro | first14 = MJ | last15 = Lowe | first15 = CR | year = 2014 | title = Reusable, Robust, and Accurate Laser-Generated Photonic Nanosensor | url = | journal = Nano Lett | volume = 14 | issue = 6| pages = 3587\u20133593 | doi = 10.1021/nl5012504 | pmid = 24844116 }}</ref>\n\nAnother type of nanosensor is one that works through a [[Colorimetry|colorimetric]] basis.

Top-down lithography is the manner in which most integrated circuits are now made. It involves starting out with a larger block of some material and carving out the desired form. These carved out devices, notably put to use in specific [[MEMS sensor generations|microelectromechanical systems]] used as microsensors, generally only reach the [[microscopic scale|micro]] size, but the most recent of these have begun to incorporate nanosized components.<ref name=\"F1\" />\n\nAnother way to produce nanosensors is through the bottom-up method, which involves assembling the sensors out of even more minuscule components, most likely individual [[atoms]] or molecules. This would involve moving atoms of a particular substance one by one into particular positions which, though it has been achieved in laboratory tests using tools such as [[atomic force microscope]]s, is still a significant difficulty, especially to do en masse, both for logistic reasons as well as economic ones. Most likely, this process would be used mainly for building starter molecules for self-assembling sensors.\n\nThe third way, which promises far faster results, involves self-assembly, or \"growing\" particular nanostructures to be used as sensors. This most often entails an already complete set of components that would automatically assemble themselves into a finished product. Accurately being able to reproduce this effect for a desired sensor in a laboratory would imply that scientists could manufacture nanosensors much more quickly and potentially far more cheaply by letting numerous molecules assemble themselves with little or no outside influence, rather than having to manually assemble each sensor.\n\n==Applications==\nOne of the first working examples of a synthetic nanosensor was built by researchers at the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] in 1999.<ref name=\"F6\">{{cite journal |author= Poncharal P|author2= Wang ZL|author3= Ugarte D|author4= de Heer WA|title= Electrostatic Deflections and Electromechanical Resonances of Carbon Nanotubes |journal= Science |volume=283|issue= 5407|pages=1513\u20131516|date=1999 |doi=10.1126/science.283.5407.1513|pmid= 10066169|bibcode= 1999Sci...283.1513P}}</ref> It involved attaching a single particle onto the end of a [[carbon nanotube]] and measuring the [[resonance|vibrational frequency]] of the nanotube both with and without the particle. The discrepancy between the two frequencies allowed the researchers to measure the mass of the attached particle.<ref name=\"F1\" />\n\nSince then, increasing amounts of research have gone into nanosensors, whereby modern nanosensors have been developed for many applications. &nbsp;Currently, the applications of nanosensors in the market include: healthcare, defense and military, and others such as food, environment, and agriculture.<ref name=\":3\">Technavio. &nbsp;Investment in the Global Nanosensors Market. 2017.</ref>\n[[File:Pie_Chart_of_Nanosensor_Applications.jpg|thumb|Brief breakdown of current industry applications of nanosensors.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}]]\n\n=== Defense and military ===\nNanoscience as a whole has much potential for applications in the defense and military sector. Applications include chemical detection, decontamination, and forensics. However, the primary efforts surrounding nanosensors largely remain in research and development.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nSome nanosensors in development for defense applications include nanosensors for the detection of explosives or toxic gases. Such nanosensors work on the principle that gas molecules can be distinguished based on their mass using, for example, piezoelectric sensors. If a gas molecule is adsorbed at the surface of the detector, the resonance frequency of the crystal changes and this can be measured as a change in electrical properties. In addition, field effect transistors, used as potentiometers, can detect toxic gases if their gate is made sensitive to them.<ref name=\":4\">Ngo C., Van de Voorde M.H. (2014) Nanotechnology for Defense and Security. In: Nanotechnology in a Nutshell. Atlantis Press, Paris</ref>\n\nIn a similar application, nanosensors can be utilized in military and law enforcement clothing and gear. The Navy Research Laboratory's Institute for Nanoscience has studied quantum dots for application in nanophotonics and identifying biological materials. Nanoparticles layered with polymers and other receptor molecules will change color when contacted by analytes such as toxic gases.<ref name=\":4\" /> This alerts the user that they are in danger. Other projects involve embedding clothing with biometric sensors to relay information regarding the user's health and vitals,<ref name=\":4\" /> which would be useful for monitoring soldiers in combat.\n\nSurprisingly, some of the most challenging aspects in creating nanosensors for defense and military use are political in nature, rather than technical. Many different government agencies must work together to allocate budgets and share information and progress in testing; this can be difficult with such large and complex institutions.<ref name=\":5\">Carafano, J. Nanotechnology and National Security: Small Changes, Big Impact. <nowiki>https://www.heritage.org/defense/report/nanotechnology-and-national-security-small-changes-big-impact</nowiki> (accessed Dec 3, 2018)</ref> In addition, visas and immigration status can become an issue for foreign researchers - as the subject matter is very sensitive, government clearance can sometimes be required.<ref name=\":5\" /> Finally, there are currently not well defined or clear regulations on nanosensor testing or applications in the sensor industry, which contributes to the difficulty of implementation. Nanosensors are also used in detecting sugar lecel as well as to check cancerous tissues in body.\n\n=== Food and the environment ===\nNanosensors can improve various sub-areas within food and environment sectors including food processing, agriculture, air and water quality monitoring, and packaging and transport. &nbsp;These nanosensors enable rapid analysis of samples and detection of contaminants in food which is especially important for downstream processing and perishable items.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nChemical sensors are useful for analyzing odors from food samples and detecting atmospheric gases. &nbsp;The \"electronic nose\" was developed in 1988 to determine the quality and freshness of food samples using traditional sensors, but more recently the sensing film has been improved with nanomaterials. A sample is placed in a chamber where volatile compounds become concentrated in the gas phase, whereby the gas is then pumped through the chamber to carry the aroma to the sensor that measures its unique fingerprint. The high surface area to volume ratio of the nanomaterials allows for greater interaction with analytes and the nanosensor's fast response time enables the separation of interfering responses.<ref>Ramgir, N. S. ISRN Nanomaterials 2013, 2013, 1\u201321.</ref>  Chemical sensors, too, have been built using [[Chemiresistor#Carbon nanotubes|nanotubes]] to detect various properties of gaseous molecules.

Quantum dot surfaces can be modified with antibodies that bind specifically to environmental pollutants. Gold nanoparticle-based optical sensors can be used to detect heavy metals very precisely; for example, mercury levels as low as 0.49 nM. This sensing modality takes advantage of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), in which the presence of metals inhibits the interaction between quantum dots and gold nanoparticles, and quenches the FRET response.<ref>Long, F.; Zhu, A.; Shi, H. Sensors 2013, 13(10), 13928\u201313948.</ref>\n\nThe main challenge associated with using nanosensors in food and the environment is determining their associated toxicity and overall effect on the environment. Currently, there is insufficient knowledge on how the implementation of nanosensors will affect the soil, plants, and humans in the long-term. This is difficult to fully address because nanoparticle toxicity depends heavily on the type, size, and dosage of the particle as well as environmental variables including pH, temperature, and humidity To mitigate potential risk, research is being done to manufacture safe, nontoxic nanomaterials, as part of an overall effort towards green nanotechnology.<ref>Omanovic-Miklicanin, E.; Maksimovic, M. Bulletin of the Chemists and Technologists of Bosnia and Herzegovina 2016, No. 47, 59\u201370.</ref>\n\n=== Healthcare ===\nOne example of nanosensors involves using the fluorescence properties of [[cadmium selenide]] [[quantum dot]]s as sensors to uncover tumors within the body. A downside to the cadmium selenide dots, however, is that they are highly toxic to the body. As a result, researchers are working on developing alternate dots made out of a different, less toxic material while still retaining some of the fluorescence properties. In particular, they have been investigating the particular benefits of zinc sulfide quantum dots which, though they are not quite as fluorescent as cadmium selenide, can be augmented with other metals including manganese and various lanthanide elements. In addition, these newer quantum dots become more fluorescent when they bond to their target cells.<ref name=\"F3\" />\n\nAnother application of nanosensors involves using silicon nanowires in IV lines to monitor organ health. The nanowires are sensitive to detect trace biomarkers that diffuse into the IV line through blood which can monitor kidney or organ failure. These nanowires would allow for continuous biomarker measurement, which provides some benefits in terms of temporal sensitivity over traditional biomarker quantification assays such as ELISA.<ref>Bourzac, K. Nanosensors for Medical Monitoring. <nowiki>https://www.technologyreview.com/s/410426/nanosensors-for-medical-monitoring/</nowiki>. 2016.</ref>\n\nNanosensors can also be used to detect contamination in organ implants. The nanosensor is embedded into the implant and detects contamination in the cells surrounding the implant through an electric signal sent to a clinician or healthcare provider. The nanosensor can detect whether the cells are healthy, inflammatory, of contaminated with bacteria.<ref>McIntosh, J. Nanosensors: the future of diagnostic medicine? <nowiki>https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/299663.php</nowiki>. 2017</ref>\n\nCurrently, there are stringent regulations in place for the development of standards for nanosensors to be used in the medical industry, due to insufficient knowledge of the adverse effects of nanosensors as well as potential cytotoxic effects of nanosensors.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/cr400636x | volume=115 | title=Facing the Design Challenges of Particle-Based Nanosensors for Metabolite Quantification in Living Cells | year=2015 | journal=Chemical Reviews | pages=8344\u20138378 | last1 = S\u00f8ndergaard | first1 = Rikke V. | last2 = Christensen | first2 = Nynne M. | last3 = Henriksen | first3 = Jonas R. | last4 = Kumar | first4 = E.

To mitigate the drawback of cost, researchers are looking into manufacturing nanosensors made of more cost-effective materials.<ref name=\":3\" /> There is also a high degree of precision needed to reproducibly manufacture nanosensors, due to their small size and sensitivity to different synthesis techniques, which creates additional technical challenges to be overcome.\n\n==See also==\n\n{{Portal|Science|Technology}}\n\n*[[Nanotechnology]]\n*[[List of nanotechnology topics]]\n*[[Surface plasmon resonance]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://gtresearchnews.gatech.edu/newsrelease/BALANCE.html Weighing the Very Small: 'Nanobalance' Based on Carbon Nanotubes Shows New Application for Nanomechanics], Georgia Tech Research News.\n* [http://www.crnano.org/Marchant.pps Emerging Technologies and the Environment]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110714152835/http://www.nanoandsociety.com/framing/papers/NanotechSocietal.pdf Nanotechnology and Societal Transformation]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110614142313/http://www.law.ualberta.ca/centres/hli/userfiles/12-3-09MacDonald.pdf Nanotechnology, Privacy and Shifting Social Conventions]\n* [http://www.foresight.org/policy/brief7.html Nanotechnology and Surveillance]\n\n{{emerging technologies|topics=yes|biomed=yes}}\n\n[[Category:Nanotechnology]]\n[[Category:Nanomedicine]]\n[[Category:Emerging technologies]]\n", "text_old": "{{Nanotech}}\n\n'''Nanosensors''' are nanoscale devices that measure physical quantities and convert those quantities to signals that can be detected and analyzed.

Nanosensors can have increased specificity because they operate at a similar scale as natural biological processes, allowing functionalization with chemical and biological molecules, with recognition events that cause detectable physical changes. Enhancements in sensitivity stem from the high surface-to-volume ratio of nanomaterials, as well as novel physical properties of nanomaterials that can be used as the basis for detection, including [[nanophotonics]].

Top-down lithography is the manner in which most integrated circuits are now made. It involves starting out with a larger block of some material and carving out the desired form. These carved out devices, notably put to use in specific [[MEMS sensor generations|microelectromechanical systems]] used as microsensors, generally only reach the [[microscopic scale|micro]] size, but the most recent of these have begun to incorporate nanosized components.<ref name=\"F1\" />\n\nAnother way to produce nanosensors is through the bottom-up method, which involves assembling the sensors out of even more minuscule components, most likely individual [[atoms]] or molecules. This would involve moving atoms of a particular substance one by one into particular positions which, though it has been achieved in laboratory tests using tools such as [[atomic force microscope]]s, is still a significant difficulty, especially to do en masse, both for logistic reasons as well as economic ones. Most likely, this process would be used mainly for building starter molecules for self-assembling sensors.\n\nThe third way, which promises far faster results, involves self-assembly, or \"growing\" particular nanostructures to be used as sensors. This most often entails an already complete set of components that would automatically assemble themselves into a finished product. Accurately being able to reproduce this effect for a desired sensor in a laboratory would imply that scientists could manufacture nanosensors much more quickly and potentially far more cheaply by letting numerous molecules assemble themselves with little or no outside influence, rather than having to manually assemble each sensor.\n\n==Applications==\nOne of the first working examples of a synthetic nanosensor was built by researchers at the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] in 1999.<ref name=\"F6\">{{cite journal |author= Poncharal P|author2= Wang ZL|author3= Ugarte D|author4= de Heer WA|title= Electrostatic Deflections and Electromechanical Resonances of Carbon Nanotubes |journal= Science |volume=283|issue= 5407|pages=1513\u20131516|date=1999 |doi=10.1126/science.283.5407.1513|pmid= 10066169|bibcode= 1999Sci...283.1513P}}</ref> It involved attaching a single particle onto the end of a [[carbon nanotube]] and measuring the [[resonance|vibrational frequency]] of the nanotube both with and without the particle. The discrepancy between the two frequencies allowed the researchers to measure the mass of the attached particle.<ref name=\"F1\" />\n\nSince then, increasing amounts of research have gone into nanosensors, whereby modern nanosensors have been developed for many applications. &nbsp;Currently, the applications of nanosensors in the market include: healthcare, defense and military, and others such as food, environment, and agriculture.<ref name=\":3\">Technavio. &nbsp;Investment in the Global Nanosensors Market. 2017.</ref>\n[[File:Pie_Chart_of_Nanosensor_Applications.jpg|thumb|Brief breakdown of current industry applications of nanosensors.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}]]\n\n=== Defense and military ===\nNanoscience as a whole has much potential for applications in the defense and military sector. Applications include chemical detection, decontamination, and forensics. However, the primary efforts surrounding nanosensors largely remain in research and development.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nSome nanosensors in development for defense applications include nanosensors for the detection of explosives or toxic gases. Such nanosensors work on the principle that gas molecules can be distinguished based on their mass using, for example, piezoelectric sensors. If a gas molecule is adsorbed at the surface of the detector, the resonance frequency of the crystal changes and this can be measured as a change in electrical properties. In addition, field effect transistors, used as potentiometers, can detect toxic gases if their gate is made sensitive to them.<ref name=\":4\">Ngo C., Van de Voorde M.H. (2014) Nanotechnology for Defense and Security. In: Nanotechnology in a Nutshell. Atlantis Press, Paris</ref>\n\nIn a similar application, nanosensors can be utilized in military and law enforcement clothing and gear. The Navy Research Laboratory's Institute for Nanoscience has studied quantum dots for application in nanophotonics and identifying biological materials. Nanoparticles layered with polymers and other receptor molecules will change color when contacted by analytes such as toxic gases.<ref name=\":4\" /> This alerts the user that they are in danger. Other projects involve embedding clothing with biometric sensors to relay information regarding the user's health and vitals,<ref name=\":4\" /> which would be useful for monitoring soldiers in combat.\n\nSurprisingly, some of the most challenging aspects in creating nanosensors for defense and military use are political in nature, rather than technical. Many different government agencies must work together to allocate budgets and share information and progress in testing; this can be difficult with such large and complex institutions.<ref name=\":5\">Carafano, J. Nanotechnology and National Security: Small Changes, Big Impact. <nowiki>https://www.heritage.org/defense/report/nanotechnology-and-national-security-small-changes-big-impact</nowiki> (accessed Dec 3, 2018)</ref> In addition, visas and immigration status can become an issue for foreign researchers - as the subject matter is very sensitive, government clearance can sometimes be required.<ref name=\":5\" /> Finally, there are currently not well defined or clear regulations on nanosensor testing or applications in the sensor industry, which contributes to the difficulty of implementation. Nanosensors are also used in detecting sugar lecel as well as to check cancerous tissues in body.\n\n=== Food and the environment ===\nNanosensors can improve various sub-areas within food and environment sectors including food processing, agriculture, air and water quality monitoring, and packaging and transport. &nbsp;These nanosensors enable rapid analysis of samples and detection of contaminants in food which is especially important for downstream processing and perishable items.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nChemical sensors are useful for analyzing odors from food samples and detecting atmospheric gases. &nbsp;The \"electronic nose\" was developed in 1988 to determine the quality and freshness of food samples using traditional sensors, but more recently the sensing film has been improved with nanomaterials. A sample is placed in a chamber where volatile compounds become concentrated in the gas phase, whereby the gas is then pumped through the chamber to carry the aroma to the sensor that measures its unique fingerprint. The high surface area to volume ratio of the nanomaterials allows for greater interaction with analytes and the nanosensor's fast response time enables the separation of interfering responses.<ref>Ramgir, N. S. ISRN Nanomaterials 2013, 2013, 1\u201321.</ref>  Chemical sensors, too, have been built using [[Chemiresistor#Carbon nanotubes|nanotubes]] to detect various properties of gaseous molecules. Carbon nanotubes have been used to sense [[ionization]] of gaseous molecules while nanotubes made out of titanium have been employed to detect atmospheric concentrations of hydrogen at the molecular level.<ref name=\"F7\">{{cite journal |author=Modi A|author2=Koratkar N|author3=Lass E|author4= Wei B|author5=Ajayan PM|title= Miniaturized Gas Ionization Sensors using Carbon Nanotubes|journal= Nature |volume=424|issue=6945|pages=171\u2013174|date=2003|doi=10.1038/nature01777|pmid=12853951|bibcode=2003Natur.424..171M}}</ref><ref name=\"F8\">{{cite journal |author= Kong J|author2= Franklin NR|author3= Zhou C|author4= Chapline MG|author5= Peng S|author6=  Cho K|author7=  Dai H.|title= Nanotubes Molecular Wires as Chemical Sensors |journal= Science |volume=287 |issue=5453 |pages=622\u2013625|date=2000 |doi=10.1126/science.287.5453.622|pmid= 10649989|bibcode= 2000Sci...287..622K}}</ref> Many of these involve a system by which nanosensors are built to have a specific pocket for another molecule.

Quantum dot surfaces can be modified with antibodies that bind specifically to environmental pollutants. Gold nanoparticle-based optical sensors can be used to detect heavy metals very precisely; for example, mercury levels as low as 0.49 nM. This sensing modality takes advantage of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), in which the presence of metals inhibits the interaction between quantum dots and gold nanoparticles, and quenches the FRET response.<ref>Long, F.; Zhu, A.; Shi, H. Sensors 2013, 13(10), 13928\u201313948.</ref>\n\nThe main challenge associated with using nanosensors in food and the environment is determining their associated toxicity and overall effect on the environment. Currently, there is insufficient knowledge on how the implementation of nanosensors will affect the soil, plants, and humans in the long-term. This is difficult to fully address because nanoparticle toxicity depends heavily on the type, size, and dosage of the particle as well as environmental variables including pH, temperature, and humidity To mitigate potential risk, research is being done to manufacture safe, nontoxic nanomaterials, as part of an overall effort towards green nanotechnology.<ref>Omanovic-Miklicanin, E.; Maksimovic, M. Bulletin of the Chemists and Technologists of Bosnia and Herzegovina 2016, No. 47, 59\u201370.</ref>\n\n=== Healthcare ===\nOne example of nanosensors involves using the fluorescence properties of [[cadmium selenide]] [[quantum dot]]s as sensors to uncover tumors within the body. A downside to the cadmium selenide dots, however, is that they are highly toxic to the body. As a result, researchers are working on developing alternate dots made out of a different, less toxic material while still retaining some of the fluorescence properties. In particular, they have been investigating the particular benefits of zinc sulfide quantum dots which, though they are not quite as fluorescent as cadmium selenide, can be augmented with other metals including manganese and various lanthanide elements. In addition, these newer quantum dots become more fluorescent when they bond to their target cells.<ref name=\"F3\" />\n\nAnother application of nanosensors involves using silicon nanowires in IV lines to monitor organ health. The nanowires are sensitive to detect trace biomarkers that diffuse into the IV line through blood which can monitor kidney or organ failure. These nanowires would allow for continuous biomarker measurement, which provides some benefits in terms of temporal sensitivity over traditional biomarker quantification assays such as ELISA.<ref>Bourzac, K. Nanosensors for Medical Monitoring. <nowiki>https://www.technologyreview.com/s/410426/nanosensors-for-medical-monitoring/</nowiki>. 2016.</ref>\n\nNanosensors can also be used to detect contamination in organ implants. The nanosensor is embedded into the implant and detects contamination in the cells surrounding the implant through an electric signal sent to a clinician or healthcare provider. The nanosensor can detect whether the cells are healthy, inflammatory, of contaminated with bacteria.<ref>McIntosh, J. Nanosensors: the future of diagnostic medicine? <nowiki>https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/299663.php</nowiki>. 2017</ref>\n\nCurrently, there are stringent regulations in place for the development of standards for nanosensors to be used in the medical industry, due to insufficient knowledge of the adverse effects of nanosensors as well as potential cytotoxic effects of nanosensors.<ref>Sondergaard, R. V. Facing the Design Challenges of Particle-Based Nanosensors for Metabolite Quantification in Living Cells. <nowiki>https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/cr400636x</nowiki> (accessed Dec 6, 2018).</ref> Additionally, there can be a high cost of raw materials such as silicon, nanowires, and carbon nanotubes, which prevent commercialization and manufacturing of nanosensors requiring scale-up for implementation. To mitigate the drawback of cost, researchers are looking into manufacturing nanosensors made of more cost-effective materials.<ref name=\":3\" /> There is also a high degree of precision needed to reproducibly manufacture nanosensors, due to their small size and sensitivity to different synthesis techniques, which creates additional technical challenges to be overcome.\n\n==See also==\n\n{{Portal|Science|Technology}}\n\n*[[Nanotechnology]]\n*[[List of nanotechnology topics]]\n*[[Surface plasmon resonance]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://gtresearchnews.gatech.edu/newsrelease/BALANCE.html Weighing the Very Small: 'Nanobalance' Based on Carbon Nanotubes Shows New Application for Nanomechanics], Georgia Tech Research News.\n* [http://www.crnano.org/Marchant.pps Emerging Technologies and the Environment]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110714152835/http://www.nanoandsociety.com/framing/papers/NanotechSocietal.pdf Nanotechnology and Societal Transformation]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110614142313/http://www.law.ualberta.ca/centres/hli/userfiles/12-3-09MacDonald.pdf Nanotechnology, Privacy and Shifting Social Conventions]\n* [http://www.foresight.org/policy/brief7.html Nanotechnology and Surveillance]\n\n{{emerging technologies|topics=yes|biomed=yes}}\n\n[[Category:Nanotechnology]]\n[[Category:Nanomedicine]]\n[[Category:Emerging technologies]]\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "Journal cites:, templated 1 journal cites", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanosensor"}
