'''[[Environmental impact]]s''' affect the [[carrying capacity]] of the area, vegetation, air quality, bodies of water, the [[water table]], wildlife, and natural phenomena. '''Sociocultural impacts''' are associated with interactions between people with differing cultural backgrounds, attitudes and behaviors, and relationships to material goods.<ref name=\"Mason\" />  The introduction of tourists to sensitive areas can be detrimental, cause a loss of culture, or, alternatively, contribute to the preservation of culture and cultural sites through increased resources. '''[[Economic impact]]s''' are usually seen as positive, contributing to employment, better services, and social stability. Cultural education may also be improved, which can be overlooked.<ref name=\"Rollins et al 2016\">Rollins, R., Dearden P. and Fennell, D. (2016) \"Tourism, Ecotourism and Protected Areas\". In P. Dearden, R. Rollins and M.

Peoples' desire for more authentic and challenging experiences results in their destinations becoming more remote, to the few remaining pristine and natural environments left on the planet. The positive impact of this can be an increased [[environmental awareness|awareness]] of environmental stewardship.<ref>Moghimehfar, F., & Halpenny, E. A. (2016). \"How do people negotiate through their constraints to engage in pro-environmental behavior? A study of front-country campers in Alberta, Canada\". ''Tourism Management'', 57, 362\u2013372.</ref> The negative impact can be a destruction of the very experience that people are seeking. There are direct and indirect impacts, immediate and long-term impacts, and there are impacts that are both proximal and distal to the tourist destination. These impacts can be separated into three categories: facility impacts, tourist activities, and the transit effect.\n\n=== Facility impacts ===\nFacility impacts occur when a regional area evolves from \"exploration\" to \"involvement\" and then into the \"development\" stage of the tourist area life cycle.<ref>Butler, R. W. (1980). \"The concept of a tourist area cycle of evolution: implications for management of resources\". ''The Canadian Geographer/Le G\u00e9ographe canadien'', 24(1), 5\u201312.</ref> During the latter phase there can be both direct and indirect environmental impacts through the construction of [[superstructure]] such as hotels, restaurants, and shops, and infrastructure such as roads and power supply. As the destination develops, more tourists seek out the experience. Their impacts increase accordingly. The requirement for water for washing, [[waste disposal]], and drinking increases. Rivers can be altered, excessively extracted, and polluted by the demands of tourists. [[Noise pollution]] has the capacity to disturb wildlife and alter behavior, and [[light pollution]] can disrupt the feeding and [[reproductive behaviour]] of many creatures. When power is supplied by diesel or gasoline generators there is additional noise and pollution. General [[waste]] and garbage are also a result of the facilities. As more tourists arrive there is an increase in food and beverages consumed, which in turn creates [[waste plastic]] and [[non-biodegradable]] products.\n\n=== Tourist activities ===\n[[File:Turtle riding, Great Barrier Reef (7687773596).jpg|right|thumb|Turtle riding was a popular tourist activity in the 1920s and 1930s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://anmm.wordpress.com/2013/08/10/the-sport-of-turtle-riding-and-the-greatest-liar-on-earth/|title=The sport of turtle riding  'the Greatest Liar on Earth'|work=[[Australian National Maritime Museum]]|date=10 August 2013}}</ref>]]\nPractically all tourist activities have an ecological impact on the host destination. In rural destinations activities, such as [[hiking]] the local ecology.\n\nThere are a range of impacts from hiking, trekking, and [[camping]] that directly affect the activity area. The most obvious is the erosion and compaction of [[trail]]<nowiki/>s through daily use. With the presence of obstacles such as fallen trees or puddles, trails becomes widened or informal trails are created to bypass the obstacle.<ref>Marion, J.L. (1998). \"Recreation Ecology Research Findings: Implications for Wilderness and Park Managers\". ''Proceedings of the National Outdoor Ethics Conference'', 18\u201321 April 1996, St. Louis, MO. Gaithersburg, MD: Izaak Walton League of America. pp. 188\u2013196.</ref> Other direct impacts include damage or removal of vegetation, loss of vegetation height, reduction in foliage cover, exposure of tree root systems, migration of trampled vegetation, and introduction of [[non-native species]].<ref>Marion, J. L., & Leung, Y. F. (2001). \"Trail Resource Impacts and an Examination of Alternative Assessment Techniques\".

There are similar impacts on campsites, such as soil compaction, erosion and composition, loss of vegetation and foliage, and the additional issues regarding [[campfires]]. Informal trails are created around the campsite in order to collect firewood and water, and trees and saplings can be trampled, damaged, or cut-down for fuel. The heat of campfires may damage tree-root systems.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Marion, J. L., & Cole, D. N.|year=1996|title=Spatial and temporal variation in soil and vegetation impacts on campsites|journal=Ecological Applications|volume=6|issue=2|pages=520\u2013530|doi=10.2307/2269388 |jstor=2269388|hdl=10919/46861|hdl-access=free}}</ref> In formal campgrounds, tent pad areas are normally devoid of vegetation, while random camping can damage sensitive plants and grasses during a single overnight stay.\n\nAs with most recreational activities, hiking and camping generate waste, including food scraps and human waste. Habituation of wildlife to human contact and to unusual food sources can have a detrimental effect on the wildlife and pose dangers for humans. Provision for deposit, collection, and removal of waste will also have a direct impact on the local environment.\n\nTourism can act as a vector in the spread of non-native species. With tourism comes an increase and concentration of human activity in specific localized regions of the landscape especially protected wildernesses and parks. Because of the increase in human visitation from many different geographical regions, non-native species are observed at a higher propagation rate in these areas. Typical recreation activities such as hiking, biking, and off-road driving can act as habitat disturbances which may increase the spread of aggressive invasive species, harming the natural ecosystem. Nature-based tourism (i.e., wildlife viewing and outdoor recreation) are thought to be increasing and often happen in more pristine habitats. With the disturbance from human activities, open niches may become available giving opportunity for aggressive non-native species to become established and take advantage of new resource availability. This can have dire consequences on local flora and fauna as invasives tend to be particularly successful in colonizing disturbed areas where the local biotic communities have been affected and potentially harmed.\n\nExamples of invasive species spread by tourism:\n* Bigheaded ant (Pheidole megacephala): Is one of the worst invasives and classified under the \u201cworld's 100 worst\u201d invasive species. Originally found in the Galapagos Islands in 2007 within ship cargo for tourist supplies. Ants can be spread with the movement of people from one island to another. \n* Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum): Spread fast, don\u2019t allow native species to grow, can cause forest fires to spread rapidly. Can be carried by people through shoes and gear; pets and other animals can spread the seeds through their travel as well. \n* Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha): These are believed to have come from the Caspian Sea in Europe in a ship's ballast water. They are spread by uncleansed boats from one body of water to another as tourists move to different locations.\n\nThere are ways to decrease the spread of non-native species such as taking care in removing seeds from shoes and pants after hiking or biking. Thoroughly cleaning boats when moving from one body of water to another and creating designated pathway management plans are other ways in which one can decrease the impacts of invasive species on local habitats.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schaeffer |first1=S.

This happens in a range of formats, on land and in the ocean. Wildlife safaris in African countries such as [[Kenya]], [[Botswana]], and [[Tanzania]] have been popular for many years. Their focus are the [[big five game]] megafauna: the [[African lion]], [[African elephant]], [[African leopard]], [[cape buffalo]], and [[rhinoceros]]. As with every human-wildlife interaction, there is a change in the natural interaction of the species. The mere presence of humans can increase the heart rate and [[stress hormones]] of even the largest animal.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.2193/2006-015 |title=Stress Response of Working African Elephants to Transportation and Safari Adventures |journal=Journal of Wildlife Management |volume=71 |issue=4 |pages=1257\u20131260 |year=2007 |last1=Millspaugh |first1=Joshua J. |last2=Burke |first2=Tarryne |last3=Van Dyk |first3=GUS |last4=Slotow |first4=ROB |last5=Washburn |first5=Brian E. |last6=Woods |first6=Rami J. |url=https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1721&context=icwdm_usdanwrc }}</ref> Other changes in behavior have been recognized.

[[Anthropogenic climate change]] has both a direct and indirect impact on tourism.\n\n== Sociocultural impacts of tourism ==\nAn inherent aspect of tourism is the seeking of [https://www.andamanbliss.com/ authenticity], the desire to experience a different cultural setting in its natural environment.<ref name=\"Manzar Bashir\">([https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi8EVNFYBWJndysMb9QdzEQ/cabebooks/FullTextPDF/2013/20133092981.pdf Fernandes])</ref><ref name=\"Manzar Bashir2\">(Fagence, http://https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi8EVNFYBWJndysMb9QdzEQ/FullTextPDF/2003/20033017728.pdf){{|date=April 2020}}</ref> Although cultural tourism provides opportunities for understanding and education, there are serious impacts that arise as a result. It is not only the volume of tourism at work, but the types of [[social interaction]]s that occur between tourist and host. There are three broad effects at the local level: the commodification of culture, the demonstration effect, and the acculturation of another culture.\n\n===Commodification of culture===\n[[Commodification]] of culture refers to the use of a cultural traditions and artifacts in order to sell and profit for the local economy. With the rise of tourism, authors argue that commodification is inevitable.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Shepard|first=Robert|date=August 2002|title=Commodification, culture and tourism|journal=Tourist Studies}}</ref> There are both positive and negative sociocultural impacts of commodification on a culture. One positive is the creation of business and jobs for local craftsmen, who are able to sell their goods to tourists. [[Rural tourism]] is seen as a \"cure\" for poverty and leads to the improvement of transportation and development of telecommunications in an area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jh4RcWlsMZ0.htm|title=Ulfat ki ksi dahleez per, west regions|website=english.gov.cn|access-date=17 April 2020}}</ref> For the tourist, commodification creates an interest for traditional arts and social practices.<ref name=\":0\" /> However, critics of commodification believe that tourists are not interested in cultural beliefs and traditions of the locals, but are rather obsessed with owning a part of it. The argument that by monetizing cultural artifacts locals lose the value to their culture also exists. It then leads to the belief that tours are no longer authentic experiences. However, development economists will argue that culture can be utilized just as any other natural resource.\n\nResearchers look at the impact of tourists on a culture and in short, many argue that the contact with the secular West leads to the destruction of pre-tourist cultures.<ref name=\":0\" /> In addition, the \"development cure\", the idea that increasing tourism will spur economic change while strengthening local culture, is claimed to lead to new diseases, such as \"[[Addiction|drug addiction]], crime, pollution, prostitution, and a decline in social stability\" as well as growth of capitalist values and a [[Consumer Culture]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Demonstration effect===\nThe [[demonstration effect]] was introduced to tourism when researchers were looking into the effects of social influences from tourism on local communities. The demonstration effect argues that local inhabitants copy the behavioral patterns of tourists.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Fisher|first=David|title=The Demonstration Effect Revisited|journal=Annals of Tourism Research|volume=31|issue=2|pages=428\u2013446|doi=10.1016/j.annals.2004.01.001|year=2004}}</ref> There are a number of social, economic and [[behavior]]al reasons as to why the demonstration effect comes into play. One economic and social reason is that locals copy the consumption patterns of those higher up the social scale in order to improve their [[social status]].<ref name=\":1\" /> Tourism has also been accused of affecting social behavior of the younger members of a host community, who may imitate what tourists do, impacting traditional value systems.\n\n==== Criticisms of the demonstration effect ====\nThere are many criticisms of the demonstration effect in tourism. Firstly, tourism is seen as only one aspect of change in society. Local people also see examples of foreign lifestyles and consumption in [[Advertising|advertisements]], magazines, television, and films, and therefore tourism is not the only influence on local culture.<ref name=\":1\" /> In addition, the demonstration effect implies that a culture is \"weak\" and needs to be protected by outside influences. In many cases, the demonstrative effect is seen as a negative consequence, but it is argued that \"all cultures are in a continual process of change\", therefore tourism should not be considered destructive.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Community participation ===\n[[Public participation|Community participation]] refers to the collaboration between community members for the purposes of achieving common goals, improving their local community and pursuing individual benefits.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Jaafar|first=Mastura|last2=Rasoolimanesh|first2=S Mostafa|last3=Ismail|first3=Safura|title=Perceived sociocultural impacts of tourism and community participation: A case study of Langkawi Island|journal=Tourism and Hospitality Research|volume=17|issue=2|pages=123\u2013134|doi=10.1177/1467358415610373|year=2017}}</ref> Local community members are actively involved in tourism, rather than passively benefiting from it. Community participation strengthens communities and help to create a sense of belonging, trust and credibility among members.<ref name=\":2\" /> By involving local community members, tourism can become more authentic. The community and the tourists both benefit from community participation, as it boosts their respect for the traditional lifestyle and values of the destination community. Most destination community members are also the ones most impacted by tourism, therefore there is an importance in their involvement in tourism planning. Some researchers will argue that some of the negative impacts of tourism might be avoided and the positive impacts maximized through community participation in the planning process.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Acculturation===\n[[Acculturation]] is the process of modifying an existing culture through borrowing from the more dominant of cultures. Typically in tourism, the community being acculturated is the destination community, which then experiences dramatic shifts in social structure and world view. Societies adapt to acculturation in one of two ways. Innovation diffusion is when the community adopts practices that are developed by another group; whereas cultural adaptation is less adoption of a new culture and more the process of changing when the existing culture is changed.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=KASTAMU|first=MATATIZO PETER|title=Tourism as Acculturation Process and a Modern Leisure Activity|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jh4RcWlsMZ0/14883309}}</ref> Acculturation is often seen as a method of modernizing a community and there are many opposing views to the concept of modernization. One argument against modernization is that it contributes to the \"homogenization of cultural differences and the decline of traditional societies\".<ref name=\":3\" /> This means that communities will advertise their modernity to attract tourists, and will disregard their traditional customs and values. On the other hand, others argue that acculturation and modernization will help traditional communities adjust in a modern world. The idea being that teaching people to adapt will save the community from future extinction.\n\n=== Positive socio-cultural impacts===\n\nThere are number of benefits for the host community as a result of tourism. This includes economic benefits such as opportunities for local businesses which allows for increased trade among the increased number of visitors and then develops a variety of local businesses. In addition, tourism also brings employment opportunities, enhances the economy of the region, and creates revenue for the local government. Tourists also use [[public service]]s, creating funding for public services, such as health, the police and the fire department, as well as increasing the demand for public transport. Other public facilities, such as parks and benches are also well kept by the community for the tourists, improving the overall [[aesthetics]] of the host community. On a more social level, tourism leads to intercultural interaction. Tourists often engage and learn from the locals. Tourism can also increase pride in locals. They want to show off their community that tourists have chosen to visit. The increase in people also leads to creating more social venues and experiences where locals and tourists can interact in. Entertainment and [[recreation]]al facilities will allow for more opportunity to socialize and engage with each other.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Deery|first=Margaret|last2=Jago|first2=Leo|last3=Fredline|first3=Liz|title=Rethinking social impacts of tourism research: A new research agenda|journal=Tourism Management|volume=33|issue=1|pages=64\u201373|doi=10.1016/j.tourman.2011.01.026|year=2012}}</ref> Tourism can be beneficial for the host community as it provides the financial means and the incentive to preserve cultural histories, [[local heritage]] sites, and customs. It stimulates interest in local crafts, traditional activities, songs, dance, and [[oral histories]]. It also opens up the community to the wider world, new ideas, new experiences, and new ways of thinking.<ref name=\"Ryan\">Ryan, C. (2003).

(1999). \"Techniques for socially [[sustainable tourism]] development: lessons from Mexico\". ''Department of Geography Publication Series'', University of Waterloo, 52, 193\u2013212.</ref> In terms of economic disadvantages, local communities need to be able to fund the tourist demands, which leads to an increase of taxes. The overall price of living increases in tourist destinations in terms of rent and rates, as well as property values going up. This can be problematic for locals looking to buy property or others on a fixed income.<ref name=\":4\" /> In addition, to balance out tourist destinations, the number of locals to tourists must be relatively equal. This can be more problematic for tourists as their access could be denied. Other negative sociocultural impacts are differences in social and moral values among the local host community and the visiting tourist. Outside of affecting the relationship between tourist and local, it can also cause friction between groups of the local population. In addition, it can cause drifts in the dynamics between the old and new generations. Tourism has also correlated to the rise of delinquent behaviors in local host communities. Crime rates have been seen to rise with the increase of tourists. Crimes are typically those of rowdy behavior, alcohol and illegal [[drug user|drug use]], and loud noise. In addition, gambling and prostitution is increased due to tourists looking for a \"good time\".<ref name=\":4\" /> Tourism has also caused more disruption in host communities. Crowding of locals and tourists may create a vibrant ambiance, it also causes frustration and leads to the withdrawal of local residents in many places. Increased tourists also results in increased traffic which can hinder daily life of the local residents.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Economic impacts ==\nGlobal tourism in 2014 contributed 3.7 percent (US$2.5&nbsp;billion) to the world's GDP, with its total contribution rising to almost 10 percent of world GDP.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\">Turner, R.

This investment may not explicitly be related to tourism, but benefits the tourist and local [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]] all the same.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/> Indirect impacts of tourism are exemplified by the purchase and sale of intermediary items like additional supplies for restaurants during the high tourism season, or widened sidewalks in busy downtown centres.<ref name=\"Muchapondwa 2013\" /> Indirect economic impacts (the supply chain, investment, and government collective) account for 50.7 percent of the total GDP contribution from travel and tourism in 2014.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/>\n\nInduced spending, the re-circulation of a tourist dollar within a community, is another way that tourism indirectly has an impact on a community.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\">Rollins, R., Dearden, P. and Fennell, D.

Retrieved from: 28 November 2016</ref>\n\nThe tourist destination enjoys positive impacts, if there have been improvements to the natural environment such as protection, [[national parks]], or man-made infrastructure, waste-treatment plants. Tourism provides the economic stimulus to allow for diversification of employment and income potential, and develop resources within the community. Improvements in infrastructure and services can benefit both the locals and the tourists.<ref name=\"Fernandes\"/><ref name=\"Fagence\" /><ref name=\"Mason\"/> Whereas, [[heritage tourism]] focuses on local history or historical events that occurred in the area, and tends to promote education.<ref>Pigram, J. J. (1993). \"Planning for Tourism in Rural Areas: Bridging the Policy Implementation Gap\". ''Tourism Research: Critiques and Challenges. Routledge, London, 156\u2013174.</ref> Positive impacts begin when there is an increase in job opportunities for locals as the tourism industry becomes more developed. There is also an increase in average income that spreads throughout the community when tourism is capitalized on.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/> In addition, the local economy is stimulated and diversified, goods are manufactured more locally, and new markets open for local business owners to expand to.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/> Unfortunately, these benefits are not universal nor invulnerable. While more employment may be available, tourism-related jobs are often seasonal and low-paying.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/> Prices are known to fluctuate throughout the year.

As the population increases so do the impacts, [[resources]] become unsustainable and exhausted, the carrying capacity for tourists in a destination site may become depleted.<ref name=\"Nelson\">J.G Nelson, R.

For example, a TSA can measure tax revenues related to tourism, which is a key contributor to the level of enthusiasm any level of government might have towards potential tourism investment.<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> In addition, Tyrrell and Johnston<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> suggest that stakeholders in tourism benefit from the TSA because it:\n\n* provides credible data on the impact of tourism and the associated employment\n* is a framework for organizing statistical data on tourism\n* is an international standard endorsed by the UN Statistical Commission\n* is an instrument for designing economic policies related to tourism development\n* provides data on tourism's impact on a nation's balance of payments\n* provides information on tourism human resource characteristics\n\nThrough collection of more qualitative data and translating it into a more concise and effective form for tourism providers, TSAs are able to fill the previous knowledge gap.<ref name=\"Buhalis\"/> Information delivered and measured by a TSA includes tax revenues, economic impact on national balances, human resources, employment, and \"tourism's contribution to gross domestic product\".<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/>\n\n=== Projections for 2020 ===\nPredictions for the extent to which impacts of tourism will impact the [[world economy|world's economic system]] appear to agree that the number of international tourist arrivals will reach approximately 1.6&nbsp;billion by the year 2020.<ref name=\"Muchapondwa 2013\" /><ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> Of those tourists, 1.18&nbsp;billion are expected to be intra-regional, and 377 million to be long-haul.<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> Of these travelers, arrivals in [[developing countries]] are expected to continue growing from the recorded 47% of total arrivals recorded in 2011 as access to these more remote locations becomes easier<ref name=\"Muchapondwa 2013\" /><ref name=\"Norjana et al., 2014\"/><ref name=\"Zhang et al\" />\nDirect contributions of travel and tourism to the world economy and GDP are expected to rise from 3.09 percent in 2015 to 3.3 percent in 2025, with most impacts found in the investment and supply chain sectors.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/> [[employment rate|Employment]] is anticipated to rise parallel to GDP contributions; reaching 3.9 percent of world employment in 2025 (up from 3.6 percent in 2015).<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/> Direct tourism employment in 2025 will be an estimated 3.9 percent of total world employment (up from approximately 3.6 percent in 2015), while indirect tourism employment will be at approximately 4.5 percent (up from 3.6 percent in 2015).<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Sustainable tourism]]\n*[[Overtourism]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{cite journal|url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325376012|first1= A.|last1= Gorrini|first2= V.|last2=Bertini |title= Walkability assessment and tourism cities: the case of Venice|date= 31 May 2018|quote= Tourism-based assessment in the historical Venice.

'''[[Environmental impact]]s''' affect the [[carrying capacity]] of the area, vegetation, air quality, bodies of water, the [[water table]], wildlife, and natural phenomena. '''Sociocultural impacts''' are associated with interactions between people with differing cultural backgrounds, attitudes and behaviors, and relationships to material goods.<ref name=\"Mason\" />  The introduction of tourists to sensitive areas can be detrimental, cause a loss of culture, or, alternatively, contribute to the preservation of culture and cultural sites through increased resources.

Peoples' desire for more authentic and challenging experiences results in their destinations becoming more remote, to the few remaining pristine and natural environments left on the planet. The positive impact of this can be an increased [[environmental awareness|awareness]] of environmental stewardship.<ref>Moghimehfar, F., & Halpenny, E. A. (2016). \"How do people negotiate through their constraints to engage in pro-environmental behavior? A study of front-country campers in Alberta, Canada\". ''Tourism Management'', 57, 362\u2013372.</ref> The negative impact can be a destruction of the very experience that people are seeking. There are direct and indirect impacts, immediate and long-term impacts, and there are impacts that are both proximal and distal to the tourist destination. These impacts can be separated into three categories: facility impacts, tourist activities, and the transit effect.\n\n=== Facility impacts ===\nFacility impacts occur when a regional area evolves from \"exploration\" to \"involvement\" and then into the \"development\" stage of the tourist area life cycle.<ref>Butler, R. W. (1980). \"The concept of a tourist area cycle of evolution: implications for management of resources\". ''The Canadian Geographer/Le G\u00e9ographe canadien'', 24(1), 5\u201312.</ref> During the latter phase there can be both direct and indirect environmental impacts through the construction of [[superstructure]] such as hotels, restaurants, and shops, and infrastructure such as roads and power supply. As the destination develops, more tourists seek out the experience. Their impacts increase accordingly. The requirement for water for washing, [[waste disposal]], and drinking increases. Rivers can be altered, excessively extracted, and polluted by the demands of tourists. [[Noise pollution]] has the capacity to disturb wildlife and alter behavior, and [[light pollution]] can disrupt the feeding and [[reproductive behaviour]] of many creatures. When power is supplied by diesel or gasoline generators there is additional noise and pollution. General [[waste]] and garbage are also a result of the facilities. As more tourists arrive there is an increase in food and beverages consumed, which in turn creates [[waste plastic]] and [[non-biodegradable]] products.\n\n=== Tourist activities ===\n[[File:Turtle riding, Great Barrier Reef (7687773596).jpg|right|thumb|Turtle riding was a popular tourist activity in the 1920s and 1930s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://anmm.wordpress.com/2013/08/10/the-sport-of-turtle-riding-and-the-greatest-liar-on-earth/|title=The sport of turtle riding  'the Greatest Liar on Earth'|work=[[Australian National Maritime Museum]]|date=10 August 2013}}</ref>]]\nPractically all tourist activities have an ecological impact on the host destination. In rural destinations activities, such as [[hiking]] the local ecology.\n\nThere are a range of impacts from hiking, trekking, and [[camping]] that directly affect the activity area. The most obvious is the erosion and compaction of [[trail]]<nowiki/>s through daily use. With the presence of obstacles such as fallen trees or puddles, trails becomes widened or informal trails are created to bypass the obstacle.<ref>Marion, J.L. (1998). \"Recreation Ecology Research Findings: Implications for Wilderness and Park Managers\". ''Proceedings of the National Outdoor Ethics Conference'', 18\u201321 April 1996, St. Louis, MO. Gaithersburg, MD: Izaak Walton League of America. pp. 188\u2013196.</ref> Other direct impacts include damage or removal of vegetation, loss of vegetation height, reduction in foliage cover, exposure of tree root systems, migration of trampled vegetation, and introduction of [[non-native species]].<ref>Marion, J. L., & Leung, Y. F. (2001). \"Trail Resource Impacts and an Examination of Alternative Assessment Techniques\". ''Journal of Park and Recreation Administration'', 19(3), 17\u201337.</ref> Indirect impacts on trails include changes in [[soil porosity]], changes to [[Microbiota|microflora]] composition, problems with seed dispersion and germination, and degradation of soil nutrient composition.<ref>Hammitt, W. E., Cole, D. N., & Monz, C. A. (2015). ''Wildland Recreation: Ecology and Management''. John Wiley & Sons.</ref> \n\nAs many hikers and trekkers take multi-day trips, a large number will camp overnight either in formal or random [[Campsite|campsites]]. There are similar impacts on campsites, such as soil compaction, erosion and composition, loss of vegetation and foliage, and the additional issues regarding [[campfires]]. Informal trails are created around the campsite in order to collect firewood and water, and trees and saplings can be trampled, damaged, or cut-down for fuel. The heat of campfires may damage tree-root systems.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Marion, J. L., & Cole, D. N.|year=1996|title=Spatial and temporal variation in soil and vegetation impacts on campsites|journal=Ecological Applications|volume=6|issue=2|pages=520\u2013530|doi=10.2307/2269388 |jstor=2269388|hdl=10919/46861|hdl-access=free}}</ref> In formal campgrounds, tent pad areas are normally devoid of vegetation, while random camping can damage sensitive plants and grasses during a single overnight stay.\n\nAs with most recreational activities, hiking and camping generate waste, including food scraps and human waste. Habituation of wildlife to human contact and to unusual food sources can have a detrimental effect on the wildlife and pose dangers for humans. Provision for deposit, collection, and removal of waste will also have a direct impact on the local environment.\n\nTourism can act as a vector in the spread of non-native species. With tourism comes an increase and concentration of human activity in specific localized regions of the landscape especially protected wildernesses and parks. Because of the increase in human visitation from many different geographical regions, non-native species are observed at a higher propagation rate in these areas. Typical recreation activities such as hiking, biking, and off-road driving can act as habitat disturbances which may increase the spread of aggressive invasive species, harming the natural ecosystem. Nature-based tourism (i.e., wildlife viewing and outdoor recreation) are thought to be increasing and often happen in more pristine habitats. With the disturbance from human activities, open niches may become available giving opportunity for aggressive non-native species to become established and take advantage of new resource availability. This can have dire consequences on local flora and fauna as invasives tend to be particularly successful in colonizing disturbed areas where the local biotic communities have been affected and potentially harmed.\n\nExamples of invasive species spread by tourism:\n* Bigheaded ant (Pheidole megacephala): Is one of the worst invasives and classified under the \u201cworld's 100 worst\u201d invasive species. Originally found in the Galapagos Islands in 2007 within ship cargo for tourist supplies. Ants can be spread with the movement of people from one island to another. \n* Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum): Spread fast, don\u2019t allow native species to grow, can cause forest fires to spread rapidly. Can be carried by people through shoes and gear; pets and other animals can spread the seeds through their travel as well. \n* Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha): These are believed to have come from the Caspian Sea in Europe in a ship's ballast water. They are spread by uncleansed boats from one body of water to another as tourists move to different locations.\n\nThere are ways to decrease the spread of non-native species such as taking care in removing seeds from shoes and pants after hiking or biking. Thoroughly cleaning boats when moving from one body of water to another and creating designated pathway management plans are other ways in which one can decrease the impacts of invasive species on local habitats.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schaeffer |first1=S.

This happens in a range of formats, on land and in the ocean. Wildlife safaris in African countries such as [[Kenya]], [[Botswana]], and [[Tanzania]] have been popular for many years. Their focus are the [[big five game]] megafauna: the [[African lion]], [[African elephant]], [[African leopard]], [[cape buffalo]], and [[rhinoceros]]. As with every human-wildlife interaction, there is a change in the natural interaction of the species. The mere presence of humans can increase the heart rate and [[stress hormones]] of even the largest animal.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.2193/2006-015 |title=Stress Response of Working African Elephants to Transportation and Safari Adventures |journal=Journal of Wildlife Management |volume=71 |issue=4 |pages=1257\u20131260 |year=2007 |last1=Millspaugh |first1=Joshua J. |last2=Burke |first2=Tarryne |last3=Van Dyk |first3=GUS |last4=Slotow |first4=ROB |last5=Washburn |first5=Brian E. |last6=Woods |first6=Rami J. |url=https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1721&context=icwdm_usdanwrc }}</ref> Other changes in behavior have been recognized. For example, [[baboons]] and [[hyenas]] have learnt to track tourist [[safari]] vehicles to lead them to [[cheetah]] kills, which they then steal.<ref>Roe, D., Leader-Williams, N., & Dalal-Clayton, D. B. (1997). \"Take only photographs, leave only footprints: the environmental impacts of wildlife tourism\", (No. 10). Iied.</ref> This direct impact of can severely damage the delicate balance of the [[food webs]] and [[keystone species]].\n\nThere is a small but significant number of tourists who pay considerable sums of money in order to [[Trophy hunting|trophy hunt]] lions, [[rhino]], [[leopard]]s, and even [[giraffes]]. It has been argued that there is a positive and negative, direct and indirect, environmental impact caused by [[trophy hunting]]. There is a continued discussion at federal and international government level as to the ethics of funding conservation efforts through hunting activities.<ref>Ripple, W. J., Newsome, T. M., & Kerley, G. I. (2016). \"Does Trophy Hunting Support Biodiversity? A Response to Di Minin, et al.\". ''Trends in Ecology and Evolution''.</ref>\n\nAnother tourism destination activity is [[scuba diving]]. There are many negative direct environmental impacts caused by [[recreational diving]]. The most apparent is the damage caused by poorly skilled divers standing on the reef itself or by accidentally hitting the fragile coral with their fins. Studies have shown that \"na\u00efve\" divers who engage in [[underwater photography]] are considerably more likely to accidentally damage the reef.<ref>Sorice, M. G., Oh, C. O., & Ditton, R. B.

However, development economists will argue that culture can be utilized just as any other natural resource.\n\nResearchers look at the impact of tourists on a culture and in short, many argue that the contact with the secular West leads to the destruction of pre-tourist cultures.<ref name=\":0\" /> In addition, the \"development cure\", the idea that increasing tourism will spur economic change while strengthening local culture, is claimed to lead to new diseases, such as \"[[Addiction|drug addiction]], crime, pollution, prostitution, and a decline in social stability\" as well as growth of capitalist values and a [[Consumer Culture]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Demonstration effect===\nThe [[demonstration effect]] was introduced to tourism when researchers were looking into the effects of social influences from tourism on local communities. The demonstration effect argues that local inhabitants copy the behavioral patterns of tourists.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Fisher|first=David|title=The Demonstration Effect Revisited|journal=Annals of Tourism Research|volume=31|issue=2|pages=428\u2013446|doi=10.1016/j.annals.2004.01.001|year=2004}}</ref> There are a number of social, economic and [[behavior]]al reasons as to why the demonstration effect comes into play. One economic and social reason is that locals copy the consumption patterns of those higher up the social scale in order to improve their [[social status]].<ref name=\":1\" /> Tourism has also been accused of affecting social behavior of the younger members of a host community, who may imitate what tourists do, impacting traditional value systems.\n\n==== Criticisms of the demonstration effect ====\nThere are many criticisms of the demonstration effect in tourism. Firstly, tourism is seen as only one aspect of change in society. Local people also see examples of foreign lifestyles and consumption in [[Advertising|advertisements]], magazines, television, and films, and therefore tourism is not the only influence on local culture.<ref name=\":1\" /> In addition, the demonstration effect implies that a culture is \"weak\" and needs to be protected by outside influences. In many cases, the demonstrative effect is seen as a negative consequence, but it is argued that \"all cultures are in a continual process of change\", therefore tourism should not be considered destructive.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Community participation ===\n[[Public participation|Community participation]] refers to the collaboration between community members for the purposes of achieving common goals, improving their local community and pursuing individual benefits.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Jaafar|first=Mastura|last2=Rasoolimanesh|first2=S Mostafa|last3=Ismail|first3=Safura|title=Perceived sociocultural impacts of tourism and community participation: A case study of Langkawi Island|journal=Tourism and Hospitality Research|volume=17|issue=2|pages=123\u2013134|doi=10.1177/1467358415610373|year=2017}}</ref> Local community members are actively involved in tourism, rather than passively benefiting from it. Community participation strengthens communities and help to create a sense of belonging, trust and credibility among members.<ref name=\":2\" /> By involving local community members, tourism can become more authentic. The community and the tourists both benefit from community participation, as it boosts their respect for the traditional lifestyle and values of the destination community. Most destination community members are also the ones most impacted by tourism, therefore there is an importance in their involvement in tourism planning. Some researchers will argue that some of the negative impacts of tourism might be avoided and the positive impacts maximized through community participation in the planning process.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Acculturation===\n[[Acculturation]] is the process of modifying an existing culture through borrowing from the more dominant of cultures. Typically in tourism, the community being acculturated is the destination community, which then experiences dramatic shifts in social structure and world view. Societies adapt to acculturation in one of two ways. Innovation diffusion is when the community adopts practices that are developed by another group; whereas cultural adaptation is less adoption of a new culture and more the process of changing when the existing culture is changed.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=KASTAMU|first=MATATIZO PETER|title=Tourism as Acculturation Process and a Modern Leisure Activity|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jh4RcWlsMZ0/14883309}}</ref> Acculturation is often seen as a method of modernizing a community and there are many opposing views to the concept of modernization. One argument against modernization is that it contributes to the \"homogenization of cultural differences and the decline of traditional societies\".<ref name=\":3\" /> This means that communities will advertise their modernity to attract tourists, and will disregard their traditional customs and values. On the other hand, others argue that acculturation and modernization will help traditional communities adjust in a modern world. The idea being that teaching people to adapt will save the community from future extinction.\n\n=== Positive socio-cultural impacts===\n\nThere are number of benefits for the host community as a result of tourism. This includes economic benefits such as opportunities for local businesses which allows for increased trade among the increased number of visitors and then develops a variety of local businesses. In addition, tourism also brings employment opportunities, enhances the economy of the region, and creates revenue for the local government. Tourists also use [[public service]]s, creating funding for public services, such as health, the police and the fire department, as well as increasing the demand for public transport. Other public facilities, such as parks and benches are also well kept by the community for the tourists, improving the overall [[aesthetics]] of the host community. On a more social level, tourism leads to intercultural interaction. Tourists often engage and learn from the locals. Tourism can also increase pride in locals. They want to show off their community that tourists have chosen to visit. The increase in people also leads to creating more social venues and experiences where locals and tourists can interact in. Entertainment and [[recreation]]al facilities will allow for more opportunity to socialize and engage with each other.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Deery|first=Margaret|last2=Jago|first2=Leo|last3=Fredline|first3=Liz|title=Rethinking social impacts of tourism research: A new research agenda|journal=Tourism Management|volume=33|issue=1|pages=64\u201373|doi=10.1016/j.tourman.2011.01.026|year=2012}}</ref> Tourism can be beneficial for the host community as it provides the financial means and the incentive to preserve cultural histories, [[local heritage]] sites, and customs. It stimulates interest in local crafts, traditional activities, songs, dance, and [[oral histories]]. It also opens up the community to the wider world, new ideas, new experiences, and new ways of thinking.<ref name=\"Ryan\">Ryan, C. (2003).

(1999). \"Techniques for socially [[sustainable tourism]] development: lessons from Mexico\". ''Department of Geography Publication Series'', University of Waterloo, 52, 193\u2013212.</ref> In terms of economic disadvantages, local communities need to be able to fund the tourist demands, which leads to an increase of taxes. The overall price of living increases in tourist destinations in terms of rent and rates, as well as property values going up. This can be problematic for locals looking to buy property or others on a fixed income.<ref name=\":4\" /> In addition, to balance out tourist destinations, the number of locals to tourists must be relatively equal. This can be more problematic for tourists as their access could be denied. Other negative sociocultural impacts are differences in social and moral values among the local host community and the visiting tourist. Outside of affecting the relationship between tourist and local, it can also cause friction between groups of the local population. In addition, it can cause drifts in the dynamics between the old and new generations. Tourism has also correlated to the rise of delinquent behaviors in local host communities. Crime rates have been seen to rise with the increase of tourists. Crimes are typically those of rowdy behavior, alcohol and illegal [[drug user|drug use]], and loud noise. In addition, gambling and prostitution is increased due to tourists looking for a \"good time\".<ref name=\":4\" /> Tourism has also caused more disruption in host communities. Crowding of locals and tourists may create a vibrant ambiance, it also causes frustration and leads to the withdrawal of local residents in many places. Increased tourists also results in increased traffic which can hinder daily life of the local residents.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Economic impacts ==\nGlobal tourism in 2014 contributed 3.7 percent (US$2.5&nbsp;billion) to the world's GDP, with its total contribution rising to almost 10 percent of world GDP.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\">Turner, R. (2015). ''Travel and Tourism: Economic Impact 2015 World'' (pp. 1\u201320).

''Regional Studies'', 41(6), 839\u2013854.</ref>\n\nThe economic contribution of tourism is felt in both direct and indirect ways, where direct economic impacts are created when commodities like the following are sold: accommodation and entertainment, food and beverages services, and retail opportunities.  Residents, visitors, businesses, and various levels of governments (municipal to federal) all influence direct tourism impacts through their spending in or near a given tourism area.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/><ref name=\"Muchapondwa 2013\" /><ref name=\"Goeldner and Ritchie 2007\">Goeldner, C. R., & Ritchie, J. B. (2007). ''Tourism Principles, Practices, Philosophies''. John Wiley & Sons.</ref> The key component of direct economic impacts of tourism is that they occur within a country's borders and are implemented by \"residents and non-residents for business and leisure purposes\".<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/>\n\nIn contrast, indirect economic impacts of tourism can be found in investment spending surrounding a tourism offering from private and governmental interests. This investment may not explicitly be related to tourism, but benefits the tourist and local [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]] all the same.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/> Indirect impacts of tourism are exemplified by the purchase and sale of intermediary items like additional supplies for restaurants during the high tourism season, or widened sidewalks in busy downtown centres.<ref name=\"Muchapondwa 2013\" /> Indirect economic impacts (the supply chain, investment, and government collective) account for 50.7 percent of the total GDP contribution from travel and tourism in 2014.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/>\n\nInduced spending, the re-circulation of a tourist dollar within a community, is another way that tourism indirectly has an impact on a community.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\">Rollins, R., Dearden, P. and Fennell, D.

Toronto: Oxford University Press</ref> For example, a foreign tourist injects money into the local economy when he spends a dollar on a souvenir made by a local at the tourism destination.

(1997). \"Estimating the economic impacts of tourism\". ''Annals of Tourism Research'', 24(3), 592\u2013608.</ref>\n\n=== Positive and negative economic impacts of tourism ===\nThere are both positive and negative effects on communities related to the economic impacts of tourism in their communities.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/><ref name=\"Wagner 1997\"/>  A positive impact can refer to the increase in jobs, a higher quality of life for locals, and an increase in wealth of an area. Tourism also has the advantage of rebuilding and restoring historic sites and encouraging the revitalization of cultures.<ref name=\"Wyllie\">Robert W. Wyllie. 2000. ''Tourism and Society; A guide to problems and issues''. Venture Publishing. State College, Pennsylvania. Chapters 01-03</ref> A positive impact is to increase or to make better either for the tourist, the host community and residence and/or the tourist destination. Positive impacts are related more to the materialistic well-being, rather than to the happiness of a host community or tourist.<ref>Kyungmi K. (2002) Doctor of Philosophy in Hospitality and Tourism and Management: [https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/29954/Title_and_Text.pdf?sequence=1 The Effects of Tourism Impacts upon Quality of Life of Residents in the community], Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. Retrieved from: 28 November 2016</ref>\n\nThe tourist destination enjoys positive impacts, if there have been improvements to the natural environment such as protection, [[national parks]], or man-made infrastructure, waste-treatment plants. Tourism provides the economic stimulus to allow for diversification of employment and income potential, and develop resources within the community. Improvements in infrastructure and services can benefit both the locals and the tourists.<ref name=\"Fernandes\"/><ref name=\"Fagence\" /><ref name=\"Mason\"/> Whereas, [[heritage tourism]] focuses on local history or historical events that occurred in the area, and tends to promote education.<ref>Pigram, J. J. (1993). \"Planning for Tourism in Rural Areas: Bridging the Policy Implementation Gap\". ''Tourism Research: Critiques and Challenges. Routledge, London, 156\u2013174.</ref> Positive impacts begin when there is an increase in job opportunities for locals as the tourism industry becomes more developed. There is also an increase in average income that spreads throughout the community when tourism is capitalized on.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/> In addition, the local economy is stimulated and diversified, goods are manufactured more locally, and new markets open for local business owners to expand to.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/> Unfortunately, these benefits are not universal nor invulnerable. While more employment may be available, tourism-related jobs are often seasonal and low-paying.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/> Prices are known to fluctuate throughout the year. They rise in the high tourist season to take advantage of more tourist dollars, but have the side effect of pricing goods above the economic reach of local residents, effectively starving them out of a place that was once their home.<ref name=\"Muchapondwa 2013\" /><ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/>\n\nNegative impacts are the effects, that are caused in most cases, at the tourist destination site with detrimental impacts to the social and cultural area, as well as the natural environment. As the population increases so do the impacts, [[resources]] become unsustainable and exhausted, the carrying capacity for tourists in a destination site may become depleted.<ref name=\"Nelson\">J.G Nelson, R. Butler, G. Wall. (1999). \"Tourism and Sustainable Development; A Civic Approach\". ''Heritage Resource Centre Joint Publication'', Number 2. ''University of Waterloo and Department of Geography Publication Series'', Number 52. University of Waterloo</ref> Often, when negative impacts occur, it is too late to impose restrictions and [[regulations]]. Tourist destinations seem to discover that many of the negative impacts are found in the development stage of the tourism area life cycle (TALC).<ref name=\"Nelson\" />\n\nAdditionally, the economics of tourism have been shown to push out local tourism business owners in favour of strangers to the region.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/><ref name=\"Mason\"/><ref name=\"Wagner 1997\"/> Foreign ownership creates leakage (revenues leaving the host community for another nation or multinational business) which strips away the opportunity for locals to make meaningful profits.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/><ref name=\"Tyrrell\">Tyrrell, T. J., & Johnston, R. J. (2006). \"The Economic Impacts of Tourism: A Special Issue\". ''Journal of Travel Research'', 45(1), 3\u20137.</ref> Foreign companies are also known to hire non-resident seasonal workers because they can pay those individuals lower wages, which further contributes to economic leakage. Tourism can raise property values near the tourism area, effectively pushing out locals and encouraging businesses to migrate inwards to encourage and take advantage of more tourist spending.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/>\n\n=== Employment ===\nEmployment, and both its availability and exclusivity, are subsets of economic impacts of tourism.<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> Travel and tourism create 10.7 percent of the total available jobs worldwide, in both the direct and indirect tourism sectors.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/><ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> Direct tourism jobs, those that provide the visitor with their tourism experience include, but are not limited to: accommodation (building, cleaning, managing), food and drink services, entertainment, manufacturing, and shopping<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/><ref name=\"Wagner 1997\"/><ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> Indirect tourism employment opportunities include the manufacturing of aircraft, boats, and other transportation, as well as the construction of additional [[superstructure]] and infrastructure necessary to accommodate these travel products (airports, harbours, etc.)<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/>\n\n===Tourism satellite account===\nThe [[World Travel and Tourism Council]] (WTTC) tourism satellite account (TSA) is a system of measurement recognized by the United Nations to define the extent of an economic sector that is not so easily defined as industries like [[forest industry|forestry]] or [[oil and gas industry|oil and gas]]<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> Tourism does not fit neatly into a statistical model; because it is not so much dependent on the physical movement of products and services, as it is on the position of the consumer.<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/><ref name=\"Buhalis\"/> Therefore, TSAs were designed to standardize these many offerings for an international scale to facilitate better understanding of current tourism circumstances locally and abroad.<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> The standardization includes concepts, classifications, and definitions, and is meant to enable researchers, industry professionals, and the average tourism business owner to view international comparisons.<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/>\n\nBefore TSAs were widely implemented, a gap existed in the available knowledge about tourism as an economic driver for GDP, employment, investment, and industry consumption; indicators were primarily approximations and therefore lacking in scientific and analytical viewpoints.<ref name=\"Goeldner and Ritchie 2007\"/><ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/><ref name=\"Buhalis\">Buhalis, D., & Costa, C. (2006). ''Tourism Management Dynamics: Trends, Management, and Tools''. Routledge.</ref> This gap meant missed opportunities for development, as tourism stakeholders were unable to understand where they might be able to better establish themselves in the tourism economy. For example, a TSA can measure tax revenues related to tourism, which is a key contributor to the level of enthusiasm any level of government might have towards potential tourism investment.<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> In addition, Tyrrell and Johnston<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> suggest that stakeholders in tourism benefit from the TSA because it:\n\n* provides credible data on the impact of tourism and the associated employment\n* is a framework for organizing statistical data on tourism\n* is an international standard endorsed by the UN Statistical Commission\n* is an instrument for designing economic policies related to tourism development\n* provides data on tourism's impact on a nation's balance of payments\n* provides information on tourism human resource characteristics\n\nThrough collection of more qualitative data and translating it into a more concise and effective form for tourism providers, TSAs are able to fill the previous knowledge gap.<ref name=\"Buhalis\"/> Information delivered and measured by a TSA includes tax revenues, economic impact on national balances, human resources, employment, and \"tourism's contribution to gross domestic product\".<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/>\n\n=== Projections for 2020 ===\nPredictions for the extent to which impacts of tourism will impact the [[world economy|world's economic system]] appear to agree that the number of international tourist arrivals will reach approximately 1.6&nbsp;billion by the year 2020.<ref name=\"Muchapondwa 2013\" /><ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> Of those tourists, 1.18&nbsp;billion are expected to be intra-regional, and 377 million to be long-haul.<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> Of these travelers, arrivals in [[developing countries]] are expected to continue growing from the recorded 47% of total arrivals recorded in 2011 as access to these more remote locations becomes easier<ref name=\"Muchapondwa 2013\" /><ref name=\"Norjana et al., 2014\"/><ref name=\"Zhang et al\" />\nDirect contributions of travel and tourism to the world economy and GDP are expected to rise from 3.09 percent in 2015 to 3.3 percent in 2025, with most impacts found in the investment and supply chain sectors.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/> [[employment rate|Employment]] is anticipated to rise parallel to GDP contributions; reaching 3.9 percent of world employment in 2025 (up from 3.6 percent in 2015).<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/> Direct tourism employment in 2025 will be an estimated 3.9 percent of total world employment (up from approximately 3.6 percent in 2015), while indirect tourism employment will be at approximately 4.5 percent (up from 3.6 percent in 2015).<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Sustainable tourism]]\n*[[Overtourism]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{cite journal|url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325376012|first1= A.|last1= Gorrini|first2= V.|last2=Bertini |title= Walkability assessment and tourism cities: the case of Venice|date= 31 May 2018|quote= Tourism-based assessment in the historical Venice.

While \"libertarian\" (in American usage) refers to a current political persuasion, \"liberal\" in the sense of \"political liberalism\" has a longer history in political thought, so it is less bound to current political usage.</ref> secularized state lives by prerequisites which it cannot guarantee itself.'' This is the great adventure it has undertaken for freedom's sake. As a liberal state it can only endure if the freedom it bestows on its citizens takes some regulation from the interior, both from a moral substance of the individuals and a certain homogeneity of society at large. On the other hand, it cannot by itself procure these interior forces of regulation, that is not with its own means such as legal compulsion and authoritative decree. Doing so, it would surrender its liberal character (freiheitlichkeit) and fall back, in a secular manner, into the claim of totality it once led the way out of, back then in the [[Thirty Years War|confessional civil wars]].|[[Ernst-Wolfgang B\u00f6ckenf\u00f6rde]]|''Staat, Gesellschaft, Freiheit''. 1976, S. 60.}}\n\nIn a [[feudalism|feudal]] state the king represents the ultimate power based on the [[Divine Right of Kings|divine right]] doctrine, the legitimacy of king's rule is transcendentally justified. In a [[republic]] there is no generally valid notion of [[sovereignty|sovereign]], although in theory the people have sovereignty ([[popular sovereignty]]). But according to constitution the people hand over to some extent their sovereignty or government authority to state leaders and parliaments. In election coverage formulations like \"the sovereign has decided\" are used. The B\u00f6ckenf\u00f6rde Dilemma alludes to the fact that in a democracy the legitimacy of the government is justified \"from below\" in contrast to [[absolute monarchy|absolutism]]. While the absolutist state demands loyalty from its citizens and through this loyalty can exercise its rule, the democratic state relies on democratic convictions of its citizens and can not enforce those convictions itself.\n\nThis leads to difficulties in answering the question of how a democratically constituted society can secure its survival and defend itself against threats. B\u00f6ckenf\u00f6rde draws attention to the paradox that the state in the attempt to defend democracy with \"the means of legal coercion and decrees from authority\" would itself become a [[dictatorship]] because it would infringe upon the idea of people as sovereign.\n\nGerhard Czermak writes that B\u00f6ckenf\u00f6rde is \"fundamentally misunderstood when not instrumentalized\" when it is concluded from his dilemma that \"the state should promote churches and religious communities as sources of virtue in particular... He (B\u00f6ckenf\u00f6rde) speaks of adventure and points to very different forces acting in society. He means that all groups with their own, also moral, worldview contribute to integration of a part of society.\"\u201c<ref>Gerhard Czermak: ''Religions- und Weltanschauungsrecht''. S. 36, Absatz 71.</ref>\n\nIn two interviews in 2009 and 2010 B\u00f6ckenf\u00f6rde answered the critique that he had exaggerated the ethical force of religion: \"This criticism misses the context in which I made this statement in 1964. Back then I was trying to explain to Catholics the origin of the secular, that is worldly, no longer religious state and dissolve their scepticism of it. This had happened before 1965 when at the end of the [[Second Vatican Council]] the Roman Catholic Church for the first time completely recognized the concept of religious freedom. In the face of this scepticism I urged Catholics to accept this state and engage in it, among other things with the argument that the state has to rely on their ethical shaping force.\"<ref>[http://www.taz.de/1/archiv/print-archiv/printressorts/digi-artikel/?ressort=sw&dig=2009/09/23/a0090&cHash=21e4e4c527 \"Freiheit ist ansteckend\" (Freedom is contagious)], [[die tageszeitung]], 23 September 2009</ref>\n\nIn 2010 B\u00f6ckenf\u00f6rde clarified it as follows: \"To conceive of such a state the liberal order needs a unifying ethos, a \"sense of community\" among those who live in this state. The question then becomes: what is creating this ethos, which can neither be enforced by the state nor compelled by a sovereign? One can say: first the common culture. But what are the elements and factors of that culture? Then indeed we are dealing with its sources such as Christianity, Enlightenment and humanism. But not automatically any religion.\"<ref>[http://www.fr-online.de/kultur/debatte/-freiheit-ist-ansteckend-/-/1473340/4795176/-/index.html \u201eFreiheit ist ansteckend\u201c] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104053317/http://www.fr-online.de/kultur/debatte/-freiheit-ist-ansteckend-/-/1473340/4795176/-/index.html# |date=2010-11-04 }}, [[Frankfurter Rundschau]], 1. November 2010 online, 2. November 2010, S. 32f</ref>\n\nA secular version of this thought one can find already in Aristotle: that the virtue of a state is founded on the virtue of its citizens and that it rests on their disposition, habit and reason, which is also reflected in the famous quote of [[Joseph de Maistre]] that every nation gets the government it deserves. Therefore political education becomes a necessary condition for existence and an essential task (however hard it is to ensure institutionally) of the good political order.<ref>[[Aristotle]], ''Politics''</ref><ref>Reinhold Zippelius, ''Recht und Gerechtigkeit in der offenen Gesellschaft'', 2. Aufl., 1996, S. 149 ff.</ref>\n\n== Criticism ==\n\nIn this context the debate over changing values is worth noting. In the tradition of [[cultural pessimism]] [[Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann]] believes that since the 60's an uninterrupted decline in values has taken place. The erosion of \"civic virtues\" such as sense of community and pride in work as well as declining attendance in churches and shrinking religious engagement have been noted as symptoms. According to [[Helmut Klages]] instead of a decay of values what is happening is a synthesis of old and new values.

While \"libertarian\" (in American usage) refers to a current political persuasion, \"liberal\" in the sense of \"political liberalism\" has a longer history in political thought, so it is less bound to current political usage.</ref> secularized state lives by prerequisites which it cannot guarantee itself.'' This is the great adventure it has undertaken for freedom's sake. As a liberal state it can only endure if the freedom it bestows on its citizens takes some regulation from the interior, both from a moral substance of the individuals and a certain homogeneity of society at large. On the other hand, it cannot by itself procure these interior forces of regulation, that is not with its own means such as legal compulsion and authoritative decree. Doing so, it would surrender its liberal character (freiheitlichkeit) and fall back, in a secular manner, into the claim of totality it once led the way out of, back then in the [[Thirty Years War|confessional civil wars]].|[[Ernst-Wolfgang B\u00f6ckenf\u00f6rde]]|''Staat, Gesellschaft, Freiheit''. 1976, S. 60.}}\n\nIn a [[feudalism|feudal]] state the king represents the ultimate power based on the [[Divine Right of Kings|divine right]] doctrine, the legitimacy of king's rule is transcendentally justified. In a [[republic]] there is no generally valid notion of [[sovereignty|sovereign]], although in theory the people have sovereignty ([[popular sovereignty]]). But according to constitution the people hand over to some extent their sovereignty or government authority to state leaders and parliaments. In election coverage formulations like \"the sovereign has decided\" are used. The B\u00f6ckenf\u00f6rde Dilemma alludes to the fact that in a democracy the legitimacy of the government is justified \"from below\" in contrast to [[absolute monarchy|absolutism]]. While the absolutist state demands loyalty from its citizens and through this loyalty can exercise its rule, the democratic state relies on democratic convictions of its citizens and can not enforce those convictions itself.\n\nThis leads to difficulties in answering the question of how a democratically constituted society can secure its survival and defend itself against threats. B\u00f6ckenf\u00f6rde draws attention to the paradox that the state in the attempt to defend democracy with \"the means of legal coercion and decrees from authority\" would itself become a [[dictatorship]] because it would infringe upon the idea of people as sovereign.\n\nGerhard Czermak writes that B\u00f6ckenf\u00f6rde is \"fundamentally misunderstood when not instrumentalized\" when it is concluded from his dilemma that \"the state should promote churches and religious communities as sources of virtue in particular... He (B\u00f6ckenf\u00f6rde) speaks of adventure and points to very different forces acting in society. He means that all groups with their own, also moral, worldview contribute to integration of a part of society.\"\u201c<ref>Gerhard Czermak: ''Religions- und Weltanschauungsrecht''. S. 36, Absatz 71.</ref>\n\nIn two interviews in 2009 and 2010 B\u00f6ckenf\u00f6rde answered the critique that he had exaggerated the ethical force of religion: \"This criticism misses the context in which I made this statement in 1964. Back then I was trying to explain to Catholics the origin of the secular, that is worldly, no longer religious state and dissolve their scepticism of it. This had happened before 1965 when at the end of the [[Second Vatican Council]] the Roman Catholic Church for the first time completely recognized the concept of religious freedom. In the face of this scepticism I urged Catholics to accept this state and engage in it, among other things with the argument that the state has to rely on their ethical shaping force.\"<ref>[http://www.taz.de/1/archiv/print-archiv/printressorts/digi-artikel/?ressort=sw&dig=2009/09/23/a0090&cHash=21e4e4c527 \"Freiheit ist ansteckend\" (Freedom is contagious)], [[die tageszeitung]], 23 September 2009</ref>\n\nIn 2010 B\u00f6ckenf\u00f6rde clarified it as follows: \"To conceive of such a state the liberal order needs a unifying ethos, a \"sense of community\" among those who live in this state. The question then becomes: what is creating this ethos, which can neither be enforced by the state nor compelled by a sovereign? One can say: first the common culture. But what are the elements and factors of that culture? Then indeed we are dealing with its sources such as Christianity, Enlightenment and humanism. But not automatically any religion.\"<ref>[http://www.fr-online.de/kultur/debatte/-freiheit-ist-ansteckend-/-/1473340/4795176/-/index.html \u201eFreiheit ist ansteckend\u201c] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104053317/http://www.fr-online.de/kultur/debatte/-freiheit-ist-ansteckend-/-/1473340/4795176/-/index.html# |date=2010-11-04 }}, [[Frankfurter Rundschau]], 1.

November 2010, S. 32f</ref>\n\nA secular version of this thought one can find already in Aristotle: that the virtue of a state is founded on the virtue of its citizens and that it rests on their disposition, habit and reason, which is also reflected in the famous quote of [[Joseph de Maistre]] that every nation gets the government it deserves. Therefore political education becomes a necessary condition for existence and an essential task (however hard it is to ensure institutionally) of the good political order.<ref>[[Aristotle]], ''Politics''</ref><ref>Reinhold Zippelius, ''Recht und Gerechtigkeit in der offenen Gesellschaft'', 2. Aufl., 1996, S. 149 ff.</ref>\n\n== Criticism ==\n\nIn this context the debate over changing values is worth noting. In the tradition of [[cultural pessimism]] [[Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann]] believes that since the 60's an uninterrupted decline in values has taken place. The erosion of \"civic virtues\" such as sense of community and pride in work as well as declining attendance in churches and shrinking religious engagement have been noted as symptoms. According to [[Helmut Klages]] instead of a decay of values what is happening is a synthesis of old and new values. [[Ronald Inglehart]] postulates a change from material to non-material values that will ultimately strengthen democracy: he believes more cooperation and more freedom will result from this change.\n\n[[Gerhard Himmelman]] points out that the sociologists countered the debate about a decline in values with the argument that \"the modern social regulatory mechanisms and the democratic procedures serve as foundations of social integration\".

The winter is generally much drier than summer, with snow falling for 37 days on average.\n\nThe transition from the cold, dry winter to the warm, wet summer occurs rather quickly between April and early May, and there is a similarly abrupt return to winter conditions in late October and November. Summers are generally hot and humid, with the [[East Asian monsoon]] taking place from June until August; these are also the hottest months, with average temperatures of {{convert|21|to|25|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}}, and daytime highs often above {{convert|30|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}.\n\n{{Pyongyang weatherbox}}\n\n==Politics==\n[[File:Mansudae Assembly Hall.jpg|thumb|[[Mansudae Assembly Hall]], seat of the [[Supreme People's Assembly]], the North Korean parliament]]\nMajor government and other public offices are located in Pyongyang, which is constitutionally designated as the country's capital.{{Sfn|Country Study|2009|p=196}} The seat of the [[Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea|Workers' Party Central Committee]] and the Pyongyang People's Committee are located in Haebangsan-dong, [[Chung-guyok]].
