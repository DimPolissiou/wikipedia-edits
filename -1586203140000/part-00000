On that day, as he observed Alice playing apart from other children, he wanted to teach her. Gallaudet started to teach Alice what different objects were called by writing their names and drawing pictures of them with a stick in the dirt. Dr. Cogswell was impressed and invited Gallaudet to continue teaching Alice through the summer.  While many of his friends became pastors or found mission fields overseas, Gallaudet found his mission field at home.{{efn|Gallaudet later wrote to a friend that the deaf school stood \"on the hell grounds.\" No other object than the salvation of the souls of the peoples can be named of the highest moment.{{sfn|Chang|2010|p=}}\n }}  The next year Cogswell, with several businessmen and clergy, asked Gallaudet to travel to [[Europe]] to study methods for teaching deaf students, especially those of the [[Thomas Braidwood|Braidwood]] family in England.

Sicard invited Gallaudet to Paris to study the school's method of teaching the deaf using [[manual communication]]. Impressed with the manual method, Gallaudet studied teaching methodology under Sicard, learning [[sign language]] from Massieu and Clerc, who were both highly educated graduates of the school.\n\nHaving persuaded Clerc to accompany him, Gallaudet sailed back to America. The two men, with the help of Dr. Cogswell, toured [[New England]] and successfully raised private and public funds to fund a school for deaf students in Hartford, which later became known as the [[American School for the Deaf]] (ASD), in 1817.

The first permanent public playhouse, known as [[The Theatre]], was constructed in 1576 in [[Shoreditch]] by [[James Burbage]]. It was soon joined by [[The Curtain]]. Both are known to have been used by [[William Shakespeare]]'s company. In 1599, the timber from The Theatre was moved to [[Southwark]], where it was used in building the [[Globe Theatre]] in a new theatre district formed beyond the controls of the City corporation. These theatres were closed in 1642 due to the Puritans who would later influence the [[English interregnum|interregnum]] of 1649.\n{{Further|Restoration comedy|Restoration spectacular}}\n\n[[File:Theatre Royal 20130408 023.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]].

Performances were held in converted buildings, such as [[Lisle's Tennis Court]]. The first West End theatre, known as Theatre Royal in Bridges Street, was designed by [[Thomas Killigrew]] and built on the site of the present [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]]. It opened on 7 May 1663 and was destroyed by a fire nine years later. It was replaced by a new structure designed by [[Christopher Wren]] and renamed the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theatrehistory.com/british/londons_vibrant_west_end.html |title=London's Vibrant West End Theatre SCENE|publisher=TheatreHistory.com |accessdate=17 January 2010}}</ref><ref name=TO>{{cite web |url=http://www.timeout.com/london/features/2367/6.html |title=London pub trivia \u2013 Ten oldest London theatres |publisher=Timeout London |date=12 December 2006 |accessdate=17 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203204912/http://www.timeout.com/london/features/2367/6.html |archivedate=3 December 2008 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nOutside the West End, [[Sadler's Wells Theatre]] opened in [[London Borough of Islington|Islington]] on 3 June 1683.

In the West End, the [[Theatre Royal Haymarket]] opened on 29 December 1720 on a site slightly north of its current location, and the [[Royal Opera House]] opened in [[Covent Garden]] on 7 December 1732.\n\nThe [[Patent theatre]] companies retained their duopoly on drama well into the 19th century, and all other theatres could perform only musical entertainments. By the early 19th century, however, [[music hall]] entertainments became popular, and presenters found a loophole in the restrictions on non-patent theatres in the genre of [[melodrama]]. Melodrama did not break the Patent Acts, as it was accompanied by music. Initially, these entertainments were presented in large halls, attached to [[public house]]s, but purpose-built theatres began to appear in the [[East End]] at Shoreditch and [[Whitechapel]].\n\n[[File:Savoy pre-1920.JPG|left|thumb|Original interior of [[Savoy Theatre]] in 1881, the year it became the first public building in the world to be lit entirely by electricity.<ref name=Times>\"The Savoy Theatre\", ''[[The Times]]'', 3 October 1881</ref>]]\nThe West End theatre district became established with the opening of many small theatres and halls, including the [[Adelphi Theatre|Adelphi]] in [[Strand, London|The Strand]] on 17 November 1806. South of the [[River Thames]], the [[Old Vic]], [[Waterloo Road, London|Waterloo Road]], opened on 11 May 1818. The expansion of the West End theatre district gained pace with the [[Theatres Act 1843]], which relaxed the conditions for the performance of plays, and The Strand gained another venue when the [[Vaudeville Theatre|Vaudeville]] opened on 16 April 1870. The next few decades saw the opening of many new theatres in the West End. The [[Criterion Theatre]] opened on [[Piccadilly Circus]] on 21 March 1874, and in 1881, two more houses appeared: the [[Savoy Theatre]] in The Strand, built by [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]] specifically to showcase the comic operas of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]], opened on 10 October (the first theatre to be lit by cooler, cleaner electric lights), and five days later the [[Comedy Theatre]] opened as the Royal Comedy Theatre on Panton Street in [[Leicester Square]]. It abbreviated its name three years later.<ref name=TO /> The theatre building boom continued until about the [[First World War]].\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, many plays were produced in theatre clubs, to evade the censorship then exercised by the [[Lord Chamberlain's Office]]. The [[Theatres Act 1968]] finally abolished censorship of the stage in the United Kingdom.\n\n==Theatreland==\n[[File:Lyceum Theatre 1.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]], home to [[Walt Disney Theatrical|Disney's]] ''[[The Lion King (musical)|The Lion King]]''.<ref name=\"lion-lion\">{{cite web |url=http://archive.constantcontact.com/fs085/1101966345958/archive/1107747364051.html|title=1.8&nbsp;million views of Lion King |work=Theatre Views Newsletter |date=October 2011 |accessdate=9 May 2012}}</ref>]]\n\"Theatreland\", London's main theatre district, contains approximately forty venues and is located in and near the heart of the [[West End of London]]. It is traditionally defined by [[Strand, London|the Strand]] to the south, [[Oxford Street]] to the north, [[Regent Street]] to the west, and [[Kingsway (London)|Kingsway]] to the east, but a few other nearby theatres are also considered \"West End\" despite being outside the area proper (e.g. The [[Apollo Victoria Theatre]], in [[Westminster]]). Prominent theatre streets include [[Drury Lane]], [[Shaftesbury Avenue]] and the Strand. The works staged are predominantly musicals, [[Western canon|classic]] and modern [[straight play]]s, and comedy performances.<ref>Michael Billington [https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2010/mar/16/snooty-musicals-sheila-hancock \"Snooty about musicals?

(blog), 16 March 2001</ref>\n\nMany theatres in the West End are of late [[Victorian era|Victorian]] or [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] construction and are privately owned. Many are architecturally impressive, and the largest and best maintained feature grand neo-classical, Romanesque, or Victorian fa\u00e7ades and luxurious, detailed interior design and decoration.\n\nHowever, owing to the age of the buildings, leg room is often cramped, and audience facilities such as bars and toilets are often much smaller than in modern theatres. The protected status of the buildings and their confined urban locations, combined with financial constraints, make it very difficult to make substantial improvements to the level of comfort offered. In 2003, the [[Theatres Trust]] estimated that an investment of \u00a3250&nbsp;million over the following 15 years was required for modernisation,<ref>Giles Worsley [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/3607919/Falling-houses.html \"Falling Houses\"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 6 December 2003</ref> and stated that 60% of theatres had seats from which the stage was not fully visible.<ref>Michael Billington [https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2007/aug/02/theatre.musicals \"Crisis in the West End\"], ''The Guardian'', 2 August 2007</ref> The theatre owners unsuccessfully requested tax concessions to help them meet the costs.\n\nFrom 2004 onwards there were several incidents of falling plasterwork, or performances being cancelled because of urgent building repairs being required.

However, the leading [[non-commercial]] theatres in London enjoy great artistic prestige. These include the [[Royal National Theatre]], the [[Barbican Centre]], [[Shakespeare's Globe]] (including the [[Sam Wanamaker Playhouse]]), the [[Old Vic]], [[Royal Court Theatre]],  [[Sadler's Wells Theatre]], and the [[Regent's Park Open Air Theatre]]. These theatres stage a high proportion of straight drama, [[Shakespeare]], other classic plays and premieres of new plays by leading playwrights. Successful productions from the non-commercial theatres sometimes transfer to one of the commercial West End houses for an extended run.\n\nThe [[Royal Opera House]] is widely regarded as one of the greatest opera houses in the world, comparable with the [[Palais Garnier]], [[La Scala]] and the [[Metropolitan Opera House (Lincoln Center)|Metropolitan Opera House]]. Commonly known simply as [[Covent Garden]] due to its location, it is home to the [[Royal Opera, London|Royal Opera]], [[Royal Ballet]] and a resident symphony orchestra, and hosts guest performances from other leading opera, ballet and performance companies from around the world.\n\nLikewise, the [[London Coliseum]] is the resident home to the [[English National Opera]]. The theatre is also the London base for performances by the [[English National Ballet]], who perform regular seasons throughout the year when not on tour.\n\nThe [[Peacock Theatre]] is located on the edge of the Theatreland area. Now owned by the [[London School of Economics and Political Science]], it is used in the evenings for dance performances by [[Sadler's Wells]], who manage the theatre on behalf of the school.\n\n==Other London theatres==\nThere are a great number of theatre productions in London outside the West End. Much of this is known as [[fringe theatre]] which is the equivalent of [[Off-Broadway]] and [[Off-Off-Broadway]] theatre in New York. Among these are the [[Bush Theatre]] and the [[Donmar Warehouse]]. Fringe venues range from well-equipped small theatres to rooms above pubs, and the performances range from classic plays, to cabaret, to plays in the languages of London's [[ethnic minorities]]. The performers range from emerging young professionals to amateurs.\n\nThere are many theatres located throughout [[Greater London]], such as the [[Lyric Theatre (Hammersmith)|Lyric Hammersmith]], [[Theatre Royal Stratford East]], [[Rose Theatre, Kingston]], [[New Wimbledon Theatre]], the [[Rudolph Steiner Theatre|Rudolf Steiner Theatre]] in [[City of Westminster|Westminster]], the [[Ashcroft Theatre]] in [[Croydon]], [[Secombe Theatre]] in [[Sutton, London|Sutton]] and the [[Churchill Theatre]] in [[Bromley]].\n\n==Awards==\nThere are a number of annual awards for outstanding achievements in London theatre:\n*[[Laurence Olivier Award]]s\n*[[Evening Standard Theatre Awards|''Evening Standard'' Theatre Awards]]\n*[[WhatsOnStage Awards]]\n*[[Critics' Circle Theatre Award]]s\n*[[National Dance Awards]]\n*[[West End Cares Awards]]\n*[[West End Frame Awards]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|London}}\n*[[Culture of London]]\n*[[List of London venues]]\n*[[Great West End Theatres]]\n*[[List of former theatres in London]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.solt.co.uk/ Society of London Theatre] \u2013 trade body for the London theatre industry\n* [http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/LondonWestEndTheatres.htm London's West End Theatres] Information and archive material on London's historic West End Theatres.\n\n{{Theatres in London}}\n{{Coord|51|30|41|N|0|07|41|W|region:GB_type:landmark|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:West End Theatre}}\n[[Category:West End theatre| ]]\n[[Category:Theatre in London|*]]\n[[Category:Entertainment districts in the United Kingdom]]\n", "text_old": "{{use British English|date=August 2019}}\n{{use dmy dates|date=August 2019}}\n{{short description|term for mainstream professional theatre staged in and near the West End of London}}\n[[File:Palace Theatre - London.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|The [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]], in the [[City of Westminster]], [[London]], built in 1891]]\n'''West End theatre''' is mainstream professional [[theatre]] staged in the large theatres in and near the [[West End of London]].<ref name=\"cgt\">Christopher Innes, \"West End\" in ''The Cambridge Guide to Theatre'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998), pp. 1194\u20131195, {{ISBN|0-521-43437-8}}</ref> Along with New York City's [[Broadway theatre]], West End theatre is usually considered to represent the highest level of commercial theatre in the [[English-speaking world]].

The first permanent public playhouse, known as [[The Theatre]], was constructed in 1576 in [[Shoreditch]] by [[James Burbage]]. It was soon joined by [[The Curtain]]. Both are known to have been used by [[William Shakespeare]]'s company. In 1599, the timber from The Theatre was moved to [[Southwark]], where it was used in building the [[Globe Theatre]] in a new theatre district formed beyond the controls of the City corporation. These theatres were closed in 1642 due to the Puritans who would later influence the [[English interregnum|interregnum]] of 1649.\n{{Further|Restoration comedy|Restoration spectacular}}\n\n[[File:Theatre Royal 20130408 023.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]].

Performances were held in converted buildings, such as [[Lisle's Tennis Court]]. The first West End theatre, known as Theatre Royal in Bridges Street, was designed by [[Thomas Killigrew]] and built on the site of the present [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]]. It opened on 7 May 1663 and was destroyed by a fire nine years later. It was replaced by a new structure designed by [[Christopher Wren]] and renamed the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theatrehistory.com/british/londons_vibrant_west_end.html |title=London's Vibrant West End Theatre SCENE|publisher=TheatreHistory.com |accessdate=17 January 2010}}</ref><ref name=TO>{{cite web |url=http://www.timeout.com/london/features/2367/6.html |title=London pub trivia \u2013 Ten oldest London theatres |publisher=Timeout London |date=12 December 2006 |accessdate=17 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203204912/http://www.timeout.com/london/features/2367/6.html |archivedate=3 December 2008 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nOutside the West End, [[Sadler's Wells Theatre]] opened in [[London Borough of Islington|Islington]] on 3 June 1683.

In the West End, the [[Theatre Royal Haymarket]] opened on 29 December 1720 on a site slightly north of its current location, and the [[Royal Opera House]] opened in [[Covent Garden]] on 7 December 1732.\n\nThe [[Patent theatre]] companies retained their duopoly on drama well into the 19th century, and all other theatres could perform only musical entertainments. By the early 19th century, however, [[music hall]] entertainments became popular, and presenters found a loophole in the restrictions on non-patent theatres in the genre of [[melodrama]]. Melodrama did not break the Patent Acts, as it was accompanied by music. Initially, these entertainments were presented in large halls, attached to [[public house]]s, but purpose-built theatres began to appear in the [[East End]] at Shoreditch and [[Whitechapel]].\n\n[[File:Savoy pre-1920.JPG|left|thumb|Original interior of [[Savoy Theatre]] in 1881, the year it became the first public building in the world to be lit entirely by electricity.<ref name=Times>\"The Savoy Theatre\", ''[[The Times]]'', 3 October 1881</ref>]]\nThe West End theatre district became established with the opening of many small theatres and halls, including the [[Adelphi Theatre|Adelphi]] in [[Strand, London|The Strand]] on 17 November 1806. South of the [[River Thames]], the [[Old Vic]], [[Waterloo Road, London|Waterloo Road]], opened on 11 May 1818. The expansion of the West End theatre district gained pace with the [[Theatres Act 1843]], which relaxed the conditions for the performance of plays, and The Strand gained another venue when the [[Vaudeville Theatre|Vaudeville]] opened on 16 April 1870. The next few decades saw the opening of many new theatres in the West End. The [[Criterion Theatre]] opened on [[Piccadilly Circus]] on 21 March 1874, and in 1881, two more houses appeared: the [[Savoy Theatre]] in The Strand, built by [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]] specifically to showcase the comic operas of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]], opened on 10 October (the first theatre to be lit by cooler, cleaner electric lights), and five days later the [[Comedy Theatre]] opened as the Royal Comedy Theatre on Panton Street in [[Leicester Square]]. It abbreviated its name three years later.<ref name=TO /> The theatre building boom continued until about the [[First World War]].\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, many plays were produced in theatre clubs, to evade the censorship then exercised by the [[Lord Chamberlain's Office]]. The [[Theatres Act 1968]] finally abolished censorship of the stage in the United Kingdom.\n\n==Theatreland==\n[[File:Lyceum Theatre 1.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]], home to [[Walt Disney Theatrical|Disney's]] ''[[The Lion King (musical)|The Lion King]]''.<ref name=\"lion-lion\">{{cite web |url=http://archive.constantcontact.com/fs085/1101966345958/archive/1107747364051.html|title=1.8&nbsp;million views of Lion King |work=Theatre Views Newsletter |date=October 2011 |accessdate=9 May 2012}}</ref>]]\n\"Theatreland\", London's main theatre district, contains approximately forty venues and is located in and near the heart of the [[West End of London]]. It is traditionally defined by [[Strand, London|the Strand]] to the south, [[Oxford Street]] to the north, [[Regent Street]] to the west, and [[Kingsway (London)|Kingsway]] to the east, but a few other nearby theatres are also considered \"West End\" despite being outside the area proper (e.g. The [[Apollo Victoria Theatre]], in [[Westminster]]). Prominent theatre streets include [[Drury Lane]], [[Shaftesbury Avenue]] and the Strand. The works staged are predominantly musicals, [[Western canon|classic]] and modern [[straight play]]s, and comedy performances.<ref>Michael Billington [https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2010/mar/16/snooty-musicals-sheila-hancock \"Snooty about musicals?

(blog), 16 March 2001</ref>\n\nMany theatres in the West End are of late [[Victorian era|Victorian]] or [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] construction and are privately owned. Many are architecturally impressive, and the largest and best maintained feature grand neo-classical, Romanesque, or Victorian fa\u00e7ades and luxurious, detailed interior design and decoration.\n\nHowever, owing to the age of the buildings, leg room is often cramped, and audience facilities such as bars and toilets are often much smaller than in modern theatres. The protected status of the buildings and their confined urban locations, combined with financial constraints, make it very difficult to make substantial improvements to the level of comfort offered. In 2003, the [[Theatres Trust]] estimated that an investment of \u00a3250&nbsp;million over the following 15 years was required for modernisation,<ref>Giles Worsley [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/3607919/Falling-houses.html \"Falling Houses\"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 6 December 2003</ref> and stated that 60% of theatres had seats from which the stage was not fully visible.<ref>Michael Billington [https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2007/aug/02/theatre.musicals \"Crisis in the West End\"], ''The Guardian'', 2 August 2007</ref> The theatre owners unsuccessfully requested tax concessions to help them meet the costs.\n\nFrom 2004 onwards there were several incidents of falling plasterwork, or performances being cancelled because of urgent building repairs being required. These events culminated in the partial collapse of the ceiling of the [[Apollo Theatre]] in December 2013.<ref>Sarah Jane Griffiths [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-25462133 \"How safe is London's Theatreland?\"], BBC News, 20 December 2013</ref> Of these earlier incidents, only one led to people being hurt,<ref>At the Theatre Royal Haymarket in 2004, 15 people were injured when part of the ceiling fell on to them; see the Sarah Jane Griffiths article above.</ref> but at the Apollo Theatre 76 people needed medical treatment for their injuries.<ref>Alice Philipson, and Andrew Marszal [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-news/10529258/Apollo-Theatre-ceiling-in-Londons-West-End-collapses-scores-injured.html \"Apollo Theatre ceiling in London's West End collapses: scores injured\"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 20 December</ref>\n\nIn 2012, gross sales of \u00a3529,787,692 were up 0.27% and attendances also increased 0.56% to 13,992,773-year-on-year<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.solt.co.uk/downloads/pdfs/pressroom/2013-01-29-SOLT%202012-box-office-figures.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612002510/http://www.solt.co.uk/downloads/pdfs/pressroom/2013-01-29-SOLT%202012-box-office-figures.pdf |archivedate=12 June 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 2013, sales again rose this time by 11% to \u00a3585,506,455,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-news/10605402/West-End-audiences-hit-record-high-thanks-to-Twitter.html |title=West End audiences hit record high thanks to Twitter |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=29 January 2014 |accessdate=29 January 2014 |first=Anita |last=Singh}}</ref> with attendances rising to 14,587,276.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.sky.com/story/1203030/west-end-theatre-ticket-sales-at-record-high |title=West End Theatre Ticket Sales at Record High |publisher=Sky (United Kingdom) |date=29 January 2014 |accessdate=29 January 2014}}</ref> This was despite slightly fewer performances occurring in 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/187033-West-End-Has-Another-Record-Year-With-Increases-in-Both-Attendance-and-Revenue?tsrc=rnn |title=West End Has Another Record Year, With Increases in Both Attendance and Revenue |work=Playbill |date=29 January 2014 |accessdate=29 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201192824/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/187033-West-End-Has-Another-Record-Year-With-Increases-in-Both-Attendance-and-Revenue?tsrc=rnn |archivedate=1 February 2014 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Long-running shows==\n{{Main|List of the longest-running West End shows}}\n[[File:StMartins theatre London2.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[St Martin's Theatre]], home to ''[[The Mousetrap]]'', the world's longest-running play.]]\nThe length of West End shows depend on ticket sales.

However, the leading [[non-commercial]] theatres in London enjoy great artistic prestige. These include the [[Royal National Theatre]], the [[Barbican Centre]], [[Shakespeare's Globe]] (including the [[Sam Wanamaker Playhouse]]), the [[Old Vic]], [[Royal Court Theatre]],  [[Sadler's Wells Theatre]], and the [[Regent's Park Open Air Theatre]]. These theatres stage a high proportion of straight drama, [[Shakespeare]], other classic plays and premieres of new plays by leading playwrights. Successful productions from the non-commercial theatres sometimes transfer to one of the commercial West End houses for an extended run.\n\nThe [[Royal Opera House]] is widely regarded as one of the greatest opera houses in the world, comparable with the [[Palais Garnier]], [[La Scala]] and the [[Metropolitan Opera House (Lincoln Center)|Metropolitan Opera House]]. Commonly known simply as [[Covent Garden]] due to its location, it is home to the [[Royal Opera, London|Royal Opera]], [[Royal Ballet]] and a resident symphony orchestra, and hosts guest performances from other leading opera, ballet and performance companies from around the world.\n\nLikewise, the [[London Coliseum]] is the resident home to the [[English National Opera]]. The theatre is also the London base for performances by the [[English National Ballet]], who perform regular seasons throughout the year when not on tour.\n\nThe [[Peacock Theatre]] is located on the edge of the Theatreland area. Now owned by the [[London School of Economics and Political Science]], it is used in the evenings for dance performances by [[Sadler's Wells]], who manage the theatre on behalf of the school.\n\n==Other London theatres==\nThere are a great number of theatre productions in London outside the West End. Much of this is known as [[fringe theatre]] which is the equivalent of [[Off-Broadway]] and [[Off-Off-Broadway]] theatre in New York. Among these are the [[Bush Theatre]] and the [[Donmar Warehouse]]. Fringe venues range from well-equipped small theatres to rooms above pubs, and the performances range from classic plays, to cabaret, to plays in the languages of London's [[ethnic minorities]]. The performers range from emerging young professionals to amateurs.\n\nThere are many theatres located throughout [[Greater London]], such as the [[Lyric Theatre (Hammersmith)|Lyric Hammersmith]], [[Theatre Royal Stratford East]], [[Rose Theatre, Kingston]], [[New Wimbledon Theatre]], the [[Rudolph Steiner Theatre|Rudolf Steiner Theatre]] in [[City of Westminster|Westminster]], the [[Ashcroft Theatre]] in [[Croydon]], [[Secombe Theatre]] in [[Sutton, London|Sutton]] and the [[Churchill Theatre]] in [[Bromley]].\n\n==Awards==\nThere are a number of annual awards for outstanding achievements in London theatre:\n*[[Laurence Olivier Award]]s\n*[[Evening Standard Theatre Awards|''Evening Standard'' Theatre Awards]]\n*[[WhatsOnStage Awards]]\n*[[Critics' Circle Theatre Award]]s\n*[[National Dance Awards]]\n*[[West End Cares Awards]]\n*[[West End Frame Awards]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|London}}\n*[[Culture of London]]\n*[[List of London venues]]\n*[[Great West End Theatres]]\n*[[List of former theatres in London]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.solt.co.uk/ Society of London Theatre] \u2013 trade body for the London theatre industry\n* [http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/LondonWestEndTheatres.htm London's West End Theatres] Information and archive material on London's historic West End Theatres.\n\n{{Theatres in London}}\n{{Coord|51|30|41|N|0|07|41|W|region:GB_type:landmark|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:West End Theatre}}\n[[Category:West End theatre| ]]\n[[Category:Theatre in London|*]]\n[[Category:Entertainment districts in the United Kingdom]]\n", "name_user": "PortonHend", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eUpcoming productions", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_End_theatre"}

For example, certain [[autoimmune disease]]s may occur predominantly in one sex, for unknown reasons. 90% of [[primary biliary cirrhosis]] cases are women, whereas [[primary sclerosing cholangitis]] is more common in men. Gender-based medicine, also called \"gender medicine\", is the field of medicine that studies the biological and physiological differences between the human sexes and how that affects differences in disease. Traditionally, medical research has mostly been conducted using the male body as the basis for clinical studies. Similar findings are also reported in the sport medicine literature where males typically account for >60% of the individuals studied.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Where are all the female participants in Sports and Exercise Medicine research?|journal = European Journal of Sport Science|date = 2014-01-01|issn = 1536-7290|pmid = 24766579|pages = 847\u2013851|volume = 14|issue = 8|doi = 10.1080/17461391.2014.911354|first = Joseph T.|last = Costello|first2 = Francois|last2 = Bieuzen|first3 = Chris M.|last3 = Bleakley|url = https://eprints.qut.edu.au/69202/3/69202.pdf}}</ref> The findings of these studies have often been applied across the sexes and healthcare providers have assumed a uniform approach in treating both male and female patients.

These can be of several types, including direct and indirect, direct being the direct result of differences prescribed by the Y-chromosome (due to the [[SRY gene]]), and indirect being characteristics influenced indirectly (e.g., hormonally) by the Y-chromosome. [[Sexual dimorphism]] is a term for the [[phenotype|phenotypic]] difference between males and females of the same species.\n\nDirect sex differences follow a [[bimodal distribution]]. Through the process of [[meiosis]] and [[fertilization]] (with rare exceptions), each individual is created with zero or one Y-chromosome. The complementary result for the X-chromosome follows, either a double or a single X. Therefore, direct sex differences are usually binary in expression, although the deviations in more complex biological processes produce a menagerie of exceptions.\n\nIndirect sex differences are general differences as quantified by [[empirical data]] and [[statistics|statistical]] analysis. Most differing characteristics will conform to a [[bell distribution|bell-curve]] (i.e., normal) distribution which can be broadly described by the mean (peak distribution) and standard deviation (indicator of size of range). Often only the mean or mean difference between sexes is given. This may or may not preclude overlap in distributions. {{synthesis inline span|For example, most [[males]] are taller than most [[females]],<ref name=\"Gustafsson\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Gustafsson A, Lindenfors P|lastauthoramp=yes | year=2004 | title=Human size evolution: no allometric relationship between male and female stature | journal=Journal of Human Evolution | volume=47 | pages=253\u2013266 | doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2004.07.004 | pmid=15454336 | issue=4}}</ref> but an individual female could be Shorter than an individual male.

There are also differences in the structure of specific areas of the [[Human brain|brain]]. For example, on average, the [[Sexually dimorphic nucleus|SDN]] ([[INAH 3|INAH3]] in humans) has been repeatedly found to be considerably larger in males than in females.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Savic|first=Ivanka|last2=Garcia-Falgueras|first2=Alicia|last3=Swaab|first3=Dick F.|date=2010-01-01|title=Sexual differentiation of the human brain in relation to gender identity and sexual orientation|volume=186|pages=41\u201362|doi=10.1016/B978-0-444-53630-3.00004-X|issn=1875-7855|pmid=21094885|series=Progress in Brain Research|isbn=9780444536303|url=https://pure.knaw.nl/ws/files/5305590/FunctNeurol09Swaab.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Psychology==\n{{main|Sex differences in psychology}}\nResearch on biological sex differences in human psychology investigates cognitive and behavioral differences between [[men]] and [[women]]. This research employs experimental tests of [[cognition]], which take a variety of forms. Tests focus on possible differences in areas such as [[IQ]], spatial reasoning, [[aggression]], [[emotion]], and brain structure and function.\n\nChromosomal makeup is important in human psychology. Women typically have two X chromosomes while males typically have an X and a Y chromosome. The X chromosome is more active and encodes more information than the Y chromosome, which has been shown to affect behavior.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Heredity Theory Says Intelligence in Males is 'Like Mother, Like Son'|last = Tanoyouye|first = Elyse|journal = Wall Street Journal|date =June 28, 1996|pmid = |page=B1}}</ref> Genetic researchers theorize that the X chromosome may contain a gene influencing social behaviours.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB866070665214215000 |title = Hey guys, for your next party, try borrowing women's genes|last = Langreth|first = Robert|date = 1997|journal = Wall Street Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref>{{Better source|date=June 2018}}\n\nMost IQ tests are constructed so that there are no overall score differences between females and males.

The research focused on cognitive variables (for example, reading comprehension, mathematics), communication (for example, talkativeness, facial expressions), social and personality (for example, aggression, sexuality), psychological well-being, and motor behaviors. Using results from a review of 46 meta-analyses, she found that 78% of gender differences were small or close to zero. A few exceptions were some motor behaviors (such as throwing distance) and some aspects of sexuality (such as attitudes about casual sex), which show the largest gender differences. She concludes her article by stating: \"It is time to consider the costs of overinflated claims of gender differences.

An observable difference in crime rates between men and women might be due to social and cultural factors, crimes going unreported, or to biological factors (for example, [[testosterone]] or sociobiological theories). Taking the nature of the crime itself into consideration may also be a factor. Crime can be measured by such data as arrest records, imprisonment rates, and surveys. However, not all crimes are reported or investigated.

For example, certain [[autoimmune disease]]s may occur predominantly in one sex, for unknown reasons. 90% of [[primary biliary cirrhosis]] cases are women, whereas [[primary sclerosing cholangitis]] is more common in men. Gender-based medicine, also called \"gender medicine\", is the field of medicine that studies the biological and physiological differences between the human sexes and how that affects differences in disease. Traditionally, medical research has mostly been conducted using the male body as the basis for clinical studies. Similar findings are also reported in the sport medicine literature where males typically account for >60% of the individuals studied.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Where are all the female participants in Sports and Exercise Medicine research?|journal = European Journal of Sport Science|date = 2014-01-01|issn = 1536-7290|pmid = 24766579|pages = 847\u2013851|volume = 14|issue = 8|doi = 10.1080/17461391.2014.911354|first = Joseph T.|last = Costello|first2 = Francois|last2 = Bieuzen|first3 = Chris M.|last3 = Bleakley|url = https://eprints.qut.edu.au/69202/3/69202.pdf}}</ref> The findings of these studies have often been applied across the sexes and healthcare providers have assumed a uniform approach in treating both male and female patients.

These can be of several types, including direct and indirect, direct being the direct result of differences prescribed by the Y-chromosome (due to the [[SRY gene]]), and indirect being characteristics influenced indirectly (e.g., hormonally) by the Y-chromosome. [[Sexual dimorphism]] is a term for the [[phenotype|phenotypic]] difference between males and females of the same species.\n\nDirect sex differences follow a [[bimodal distribution]]. Through the process of [[meiosis]] and [[fertilization]] (with rare exceptions), each individual is created with zero or one Y-chromosome. The complementary result for the X-chromosome follows, either a double or a single X. Therefore, direct sex differences are usually binary in expression, although the deviations in more complex biological processes produce a menagerie of exceptions.\n\nIndirect sex differences are general differences as quantified by [[empirical data]] and [[statistics|statistical]] analysis. Most differing characteristics will conform to a [[bell distribution|bell-curve]] (i.e., normal) distribution which can be broadly described by the mean (peak distribution) and standard deviation (indicator of size of range). Often only the mean or mean difference between sexes is given. This may or may not preclude overlap in distributions. {{synthesis inline span|For example, most [[males]] are taller than most [[females]],<ref name=\"Gustafsson\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Gustafsson A, Lindenfors P|lastauthoramp=yes | year=2004 | title=Human size evolution: no allometric relationship between male and female stature | journal=Journal of Human Evolution | volume=47 | pages=253\u2013266 | doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2004.07.004 | pmid=15454336 | issue=4}}</ref> but an individual female could be taller than an individual male.

Some differing explanations include men's [[evolutionary]] tendency toward risk and violent behavior, sex differences in activity, [[social support]], and [[gender inequality]].\n\nDespite the difficulty of interpreting them, [[crime statistics]] may provide a way to investigate such a relationship from a gender differences perspective. An observable difference in crime rates between men and women might be due to social and cultural factors, crimes going unreported, or to biological factors (for example, [[testosterone]] or sociobiological theories). Taking the nature of the crime itself into consideration may also be a factor. Crime can be measured by such data as arrest records, imprisonment rates, and surveys. However, not all crimes are reported or investigated. Moreover, some studies show that men can have an overwhelming bias against reporting themselves to be the victims of a crime (particularly when victimized by a woman), and some studies have argued that men reporting [[intimate partner violence]] find disadvantageous biases in law enforcement.<ref>\"[M]en who are involved in disputes with their partners, whether as alleged victims or as alleged offenders or both, are disadvantaged and treated less favorably than women by the law-enforcement system at almost every step.\" Brown, G.

Involved in little more than her studies, Brooke notices Grace's hope-filled attitude, and asks where Grace finds her optimism. Grace replies \"Jesus\", and Brooke begins to read the [[Bible]] for herself. As Grace lectures on [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], Brooke asks whether their peaceful teachings relate to the biblical account of the [[Sermon on the Mount]]. Grace responds in the affirmative, and relates parts of scripture to his teachings. One student immediately texts his parents about the class, and the ensuing backlash draws the ire of Principal Kinney. She reprimands Grace, saying that the teacher's faith clouded her judgment. Grace is subsequently brought before the School Board, who inform her that legal action will be taken against her as she has violated the [[separation of church and state]]. Grace's case draws the attention of Tom Endler, a defense attorney who is willing to aid her despite being an unbeliever himself.\n\nAfter speaking to his friend Josh, Martin Yip, a college student, visits Pastor David Hill (David A. R. White) to ask him several questions about God. Former left-wing blogger Amy Ryan goes to the hospital and finds out that her cancer has miraculously vanished. She talks to Michael Tait of the [[Newsboys]], who encourages her, stating that with faith, prayers can be answered. Amy ponders this, and later makes her blog a diary about her adventures with God.\n\nThe School Board brings Grace's case before a judge in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], hoping to secure her termination and strip her of her teaching license unless she issues an apology, which Grace refuses to do. To Brooke's horror, prosecutor Pete Kane declares that the lawsuit will \"prove once and for all that [[God is dead]]\". His opening argument suggests that the society of the United States will crumble should Grace fail to be found guilty. Endler defends the idea that [[historicity of Jesus|Jesus was a literal historical figure]] and thus an appropriate subject of classroom debate. [[Christian apologist]] [[J. Warner Wallace]] is called as an expert witness.\n\nBrooke is allowed as a witness. Kane tricks her into admitting that it was Grace and not Brooke who initiated their first conversation about Jesus. As Grace becomes more and more discouraged, Brooke and her friends sing her a song in an attempt to build up her spirits. Martin visits David in the hospital with his friend Jude, and announces that he feels his call is as a pastor in China. Using a tactic to position Grace as a hostile witness, Endler gets the judge to inform the jury not to let their bias or prejudices interfere with their verdict. The jury ultimately finds in favor of Grace, who rejoices along with Brooke and Endler as Kane stands humiliated.\n\nAt one point, a character delivers a explanation of what Martin Luther King meant in his famous letter from the Birmingham jail, which he does to the African-American principal of the school (Robin Givens).<ref name=\"Ebert\" /> \n\nIn a post-credits scene, a fully recovered David is arrested by the police for failing to turn in his sermons to the government, shown earlier in the film. Jude and Martin watch as David is taken away. Then, Martin wonders what to do next, and Jude replies \"Same as always, Martin. We pray in faith.\" as David is driven off to jail, setting up the events for ''[[God's Not Dead: A Light in Darkness]]''.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Melissa Joan Hart]] as Grace Wesley\n* [[Jesse Metcalfe]] as Tom Endler\n* [[David A.

Involved in little more than her studies, Brooke notices Grace's hope-filled attitude, and asks where Grace finds her optimism. Grace replies \"Jesus\", and Brooke begins to read the [[Bible]] for herself. As Grace lectures on [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], Brooke asks whether their peaceful teachings relate to the biblical account of the [[Sermon on the Mount]]. Grace responds in the affirmative, and relates parts of scripture to his teachings. One student immediately texts his parents about the class, and the ensuing backlash draws the ire of Principal Kinney. She reprimands Grace, saying that the teacher's faith clouded her judgment. Grace is subsequently brought before the School Board, who inform her that legal action will be taken against her as she has violated the [[separation of church and state]]. Grace's case draws the attention of Tom Endler, a defense attorney who is willing to aid her despite being an unbeliever himself.\n\nAfter speaking to his friend Josh, Martin Yip, a college student, visits Pastor David Hill (David A. R. White) to ask him several questions about God. Former left-wing blogger Amy Ryan goes to the hospital and finds out that her cancer has miraculously vanished. She talks to Michael Tait of the [[Newsboys]], who encourages her, stating that with faith, prayers can be answered. Amy ponders this, and later makes her blog a diary about her adventures with God.\n\nThe School Board brings Grace's case before a judge in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], hoping to secure her termination and strip her of her teaching license unless she issues an apology, which Grace refuses to do. To Brooke's horror, prosecutor Pete Kane declares that the lawsuit will \"prove once and for all that [[God is dead]]\". His opening argument suggests that the society of the United States will crumble should Grace fail to be found guilty. Endler defends the idea that [[historicity of Jesus|Jesus was a literal historical figure]] and thus an appropriate subject of classroom debate. [[Christian apologist]] [[J. Warner Wallace]] is called as an expert witness.\n\nBrooke is allowed as a witness. Kane tricks her into admitting that it was Grace and not Brooke who initiated their first conversation about Jesus. As Grace becomes more and more discouraged, Brooke and her friends sing her a song in an attempt to build up her spirits. Martin visits David in the hospital with his friend Jude, and announces that he feels his call is as a pastor in China. Using a tactic to position Grace as a hostile witness, Endler gets the judge to inform the jury not to let their bias or prejudices interfere with their verdict. The jury ultimately finds in favor of Grace, who rejoices along with Brooke and Endler as Kane stands humiliated.\n\nAt one point a character delivers a explanation of what Martin Luther King meant in his famous letter from the Birmingham jail, to the African-American principal of the school (Robin Givens).<ref name=\"Ebert\" /> \n\nIn a post-credits scene, a fully recovered David is arrested by the police for failing to turn in his sermons to the government, shown earlier in the film. Jude and Martin watch as David is taken away. Then, Martin wonders what to do next, and Jude replies \"Same as always, Martin. We pray in faith.\" as David is driven off to jail, setting up the events for ''[[God's Not Dead: A Light in Darkness]]''.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Melissa Joan Hart]] as Grace Wesley\n* [[Jesse Metcalfe]] as Tom Endler\n* [[David A.
