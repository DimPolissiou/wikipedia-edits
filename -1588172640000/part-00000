She is best known for her groundbreaking comedy variety show, ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'', originally aired on [[CBS]]. It was the first of its kind to be hosted by a woman.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://parade.com/451837/amyspencer/carol-burnett-first-woman-of-comedy/|title=Carol Burnett: First Woman of Comedy|last=Spencer|first=Amy|work=[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]|publisher=[[Athlon Media Group]]|date=January 22, 2016|accessdate=July 11, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/carol-burnett#| title=Interview: Carol Burnett| publisher=Archive of American Television| date=29 April 2003| last=Herman| first=Karen}}</ref> She has achieved success on stage, television and film in varying genres including dramatic and comedic roles. She has also appeared on various talk shows and as a panelist on game shows.\n\nBorn in [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]], Burnett moved with her grandmother to Hollywood, where she attended [[Hollywood High School]] and eventually studied theater and musical comedy at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]. Later she performed in nightclubs in New York City and had a breakout success on Broadway in 1959 in ''[[Once Upon a Mattress]]'', for which she received a [[Tony Award]] nomination. She soon made her television debut, regularly appearing on ''[[The Garry Moore Show]]'' for the next three years, and won her first [[Emmy Award]] in 1962. Burnett had her television special debut in 1963 when she starred as Calamity Jane in the Dallas State Fair Musicals production of ''[[Calamity Jane]]'' on [[CBS]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Billboard| date=July 29, 1963 |volume=75 |issue=26| page=24}}</ref> Burnett moved to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], and began an 11-year run as star of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' on [[CBS]] television from 1967 to 1978. With its [[vaudeville]] roots, ''The Carol Burnett Show'' was a [[variety show]] that combined [[sketch comedy|comedy sketches]] with song and dance. The comedy sketches included [[parody|film parodies]] and character pieces. Burnett created many memorable characters during the show's run, and both she and the show won numerous [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] and [[Golden Globe Award]]s.\n\nDuring and after her variety show, Burnett appeared in many television and film projects. Her film roles include ''[[Pete 'n' Tillie]]'' (1972),  ''[[The Front Page (1974 film)|The Front Page]]'' (1974), ''[[The Four Seasons (1981 film)|The Four Seasons]]'' (1981), ''[[Annie (1982 film)|Annie]]'' (1982), ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'' (1992), and ''[[Horton Hears a Who! (film)|Horton Hears a Who!]]'' (2008). On television, she has appeared in other sketch shows; in dramatic roles in ''[[6 Rms Riv Vu]]'' (1974) and ''[[Friendly Fire (1979 film)|Friendly Fire]]'' (1979); in various well-regarded guest roles, such as in ''[[Mad About You]],'' for which she won an Emmy Award; and in specials with [[Julie Andrews]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Beverly Sills]], and others. She returned to the Broadway stage in 1995 in ''[[Moon Over Buffalo]],'' for which she was again nominated for a [[Tony Award]].\n\nBurnett has written and narrated several [[memoir]]s, earning [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nominations for almost all of them, and a win for ''[[In Such Good Company|In Such Good Company: Eleven Years Of Laughter, Mayhem, And Fun In The Sandbox]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/carol-burnett|title=Artist Carol Burnett|website=www.grammy.com|accessdate=July 12, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-grammys-2017-nominations-winners-list-20161205-story.html |title=2017 Grammy Awards: Complete list of nominees |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=February 12, 2017|accessdate=August 1, 2018}}</ref>\n  \nIn 2005, she was recognized as \"one of America's most cherished entertainers\" and awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] \"for enhancing the lives of millions of Americans and for her extraordinary contributions to American entertainment.\"<ref>{{cite press release|date=November 9, 2005 |title= Citations for Recipients of the 2005 Presidential Medal of Freedom |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/11/20051109-10.html|location=Washington, DC|publisher=The White House|agency= Office of the Press Secretary|access-date=June 19, 2018}}</ref> In 2013, Burnett was awarded the [[Mark Twain Prize for American Humor]] at the [[John F.

During her junior year at UCLA in 1954, a professor invited Burnett and some other students to perform at a party in place of their class final that had been canceled (which required a performance in front of an audience).

They mailed invitations to agents, who showed up along with stars like [[Celeste Holm]] and [[Marlene Dietrich]], and this opened doors for several of the girls. She was cast in a minor role on ''The [[Paul Winchell]] and Jerry Mahoney Show'' in 1955. She played the girlfriend of a ventriloquist's dummy on the popular children's program. This role led to her starring role opposite [[Buddy Hackett]] in the short-lived sitcom ''[[Stanley (1956 TV series)|Stanley]]'' from 1956-57.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n[[File:Carol burnett garry moore 1960.JPG|thumb|right|Burnett and Larry Blyden from ''The Garry Moore Show'', 1960]]\nAfter ''Stanley'', Burnett found herself unemployed for a short time. She eventually bounced back a few months later as a highly popular performer on the New York circuit of cabarets and night clubs, most notably for a hit parody number called \"I Made a Fool of Myself Over [[John Foster Dulles]]\" (Dulles was [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] at the time). In 1957, she performed this number on both ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', hosted by [[Jack Paar]], and ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''. Dulles was asked about her on ''[[Meet the Press]]'' and joked,  \u201cI never discuss matters of the heart in public.\u201d<ref name=MTprize/>\n\nShe also worked as a regular on one of television's earliest game shows, ''[[Pantomime Quiz]]'', during this time.

She portrayed a number of characters, most memorably the put-upon cleaning woman who later became her signature alter-ego.

Among other things, it parodied films (''[[Went with the Wind!]]'' for ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''), television (''[[As the Stomach Turns]]'' for the soap opera ''[[As the World Turns]]'') and commercials. Musical numbers were also a frequent feature. Burnett and her team struck gold with the original sketch \"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\", which eventually was spun off into its own television show called ''[[Mama's Family]]'', starring [[Vicki Lawrence]].{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nShe opened most shows with an impromptu question-and-answer session with the audience, lasting a few minutes, during which she often demonstrated her ability to humorously ad lib.

This was done to let her know that she was doing well and that she loved her; during the show's run, her grandmother died. On an ''[[Intimate Portrait]]'' episode on Burnett, she tearfully recalled her grandmother's last moments: \"She said to my husband Joe from her hospital bed 'Joe, you see that spider up there?' There was no spider, but Joe said he did anyhow. She said 'Every few minutes a big spider jumps on that little spider and they go at it like rabbits!!' And then she died. There's laughter in everything!\"<ref>[[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime Channel]]'s ''Intimate Portrait'' episode on Burnett</ref> She continued the tradition of tugging her ear. The show ceased production in 1978. Four post-script episodes were produced and aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] during the summer of 1979 under the title, ''[[Carol Burnett & Company]]'' basically using the same format and, with the exception of Harvey Korman and Lyle Waggoner, the same supporting cast. Beginning in 1977, the comedy sketches of her series were edited into half-hour episodes for syndication entitled ''[[Carol Burnett and Friends]]'', which, for many years, proved to be extremely popular in syndication, and in January 2015, it began airing on [[MeTV]].{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nThe show's enduring popularity surprised many when a 2001 retrospective containing outtakes and discussions with the cast, and a tribute to [[Bob Mackie]], drew in 30 million viewers, topping the Emmy Awards as well as all but the final game of that year's [[World Series]].<ref name= \"Heartbreak\"/> Her Grammy-winning memoir ''In Such Good Company'' is about the show, and Burnett tells about how it was developed, with anecdotes about improvisations, the cast, crew, and guests.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n=== 1980s: Film roles===\n[[File:Carol Burnett - 1974.jpg|right|thumb|Burnett in 1974]]\nBurnett starred in a few films while her variety show was running, including ''[[Pete 'n' Tillie]]'' (1972). She was nominated for an Emmy in 1974 for her role in the drama ''[[6 Rms Riv Vu]]''. After her show ended, she assumed a number of roles that departed from comedy. She appeared in several dramatic roles, most notably in the television movie ''[[Friendly Fire (1979 film)|Friendly Fire]]''. She appeared as Beatrice O'Reilly in the film ''Life of The Party: The Story of Beatrice'', a story about a woman fighting her alcoholism. Her other film work includes [[Alan Alda]]'s ''[[The Four Seasons (1981 film)|The Four Seasons]]'' (1981), [[John Huston]]'s ''[[Annie (1982 film)|Annie]]'' (1982), and [[Peter Bogdanovich]]'s ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'' (1992). \n\n''Voice Roles'''\nIn 2008, she had her second role as an animated character in the film ''[[Horton Hears a Who! (film)|Horton Hears a Who!]]''. Her first was in ''[[The Trumpet of the Swan (film)|The Trumpet of the Swan]]'' in 2001.

In 1974, she appeared at [[the Muny]] Theatre in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], in ''[[I Do! I Do!]]'' with [[Rock Hudson]], and eleven years later, she took the supporting role of Carlotta Campion in the 1985 concert performance of [[Stephen Sondheim]]'s ''[[Follies]]''. She made frequent appearances as a panelist on the game show ''[[Password (game show)|Password]]'', an association she maintained until the early 1980s (in fact, [[Mark Goodson]] awarded her his Silver Password All-Stars Award for best celebrity player; she's also credited with coming up with the title ''[[Password Plus]]'', when it was originally planned to be titled ''Password '79'').\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, she made several attempts at starting a new variety program. She also appeared briefly on ''The Carol Burnett Show's'' \"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\" sketches spinoff, ''[[Mama's Family]]'', as her stormy character, [[Eunice Higgins]]. She played the matriarch in the [[cult following|cult]] comedy miniseries ''[[Fresno (TV miniseries)|Fresno]]'', which parodied the primetime soap opera ''[[Falcon Crest]]''. She returned to TV in the mid-1990s as a supporting character on the sitcom ''[[Mad About You]]'', playing Theresa Stemple, the mother of main character Jamie Buchman ([[Helen Hunt]]), for which she won another Emmy Award. In 1995, after an absence of 30 years, she was back on Broadway in ''[[Moon Over Buffalo]]'', for which she was nominated for a [[Tony Award]]. Four years later, she appeared in the Broadway revue ''[[Putting It Together]]''. In 2014, Burnett joined two-time Tony Award Winner, Brian Dennehy, on Broadway in A. R. Gurney's ''[[Love Letters (play)|Love Letters]]''.\n\nBurnett had long been a fan of the soap opera ''[[All My Children]]'', and realized a dream when [[Agnes Nixon]] created the role of Verla Grubbs for her in 1976. Burnett played the long-lost daughter of Langley Wallingford ([[Louis Edmonds]]), causing trouble for her stepmother Phoebe Tyler-Wallingford ([[Ruth Warrick]]). She made occasional appearances on the soap opera in each decade thereafter. She hosted a 25th-anniversary special about the show in 1995 and made a brief [[cameo appearance]] as Verla Grubbs on the January 5, 2005, episode which celebrated the show's 35th anniversary. She reprised her role as Grubbs in September 2011 as part of the series' finale. \n\nShe also starred in television films such as ''[[Seasons of the Heart (1994 film)|Seasons of the Heart]]'' (1994). She also returned in 2005 to star in a different role as Queen Aggravain in the movie version of ''Once Upon a Mattress''. She guest-starred in season two of ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' as Bree's stepmother, Elanor Mason.\n\nIn 2009, she made a guest appearance on the ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]'', for which she was nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress \u2013 Drama Series|Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series]].

National Enquirer, Inc'''\n{{main|Burnett v. National Enquirer, Inc.}}\n\nIn 1976, a false report in the nation's leading supermarket [[tabloid journalism|tabloid]], ''[[The National Enquirer]],'' incorrectly implied that Burnett had been drunk and boisterous in public at a restaurant with U.S. Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] in attendance. The fact that both of her parents suffered from alcoholism made this a particularly sensitive issue to her.  Through years of persistent litigation, she won a judgment against the ''Enquirer'', in 1981.  Though the initial jury award of $1.6 million was reduced to $200,000 by a series of appeals, and the final settlement was out of court, the event was widely viewed as a historic victory for libel victims of [[tabloid journalism]].<ref name=\"carol_burnett_launches_1981_03_22_upi\">Scott, Vernon, [http://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/03/22/Carol-Burnett-launches-trial-balloon/6032354085200/ \"Carol Burnett launches trial balloon,\"], March 22, 1981, ''[[United Press International]] (UPI),'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"carol_burnett_given_1981_03_27_lindsey_nytimes\">Lindsey, Robert, [https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/27/us/carol-burnett-given-1.6-million-in-suit-against-national-enquirer.html \"Carol Burnett given 1.6 million in suit against National Enquirer,\"], March 27, 1981, ''[[The New York Times]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"how_tabloids_1991_01_04_nytimes\">[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/04/news/how-the-supermarket-tabloids-stay-out-of-court.html \"How the Supermarket Tabloids Stay Out of Court,\"] January 4, 1991, ''[[The New York Times]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"tabloids_lies_1991_08_12_langberg_nytimes\">Langberg, Barry (libel attorney for Carol Burnett and others), opinion essay: [http://articles.latimes.com/1991-08-12/entertainment/ca-468_1_tabloids \"Tabloids' Lies Abuse the First Amendment,\"] August 12, 1991, ,\"], ''[[The Los Angeles Times]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"tabloid_law_pt1_1999_08_atlantic\">Beam, Alex, [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/08/tabloid-law/377722/ \"Tabloid Law,\"] Part 1 of two parts, August 1999, ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"tabloid_law_pt2_1999_08_atlantic\">Beam, Alex, [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/08/tabloid-law/377722/ \"Tabloid Law,\"] Part 2 of two parts, August 1999, ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"dr_phil_2016_07_14_wash_post\">Andrews, Travis M., [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/07/14/dr-phil-and-wife-robin-sue-the-national-enquirer-for-250000-million-citing-defamation/ \"Dr_ Phil and wife Robin sue the National Enquirer for $250 million, citing defamation,\"] July 14, 2016, ''[[The Washington Post]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref>\n\nThe former longtime chief editor Iain Calder in his book ''The Untold Story'' asserted that after the Burnett lawsuit, while under his leadership, the ''Enquirer'' worked hard to check the reliability of its facts and its sources.\n\n'''Carol Burnett and Whacko, Inc. vs. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation'''\n\nIn 2007, Burnett and Whacko, Inc. brought a suit against [[20th Century Fox|Twentieth Century Fox]] requesting at least $2 million in damages, alleging copyright infringement, violation of publicity rights, and misappropriation of name and likeness due to the use of her charwoman character and an altered version of \"Carol's Theme\", the theme song used in ''The Carol Burnett Show'', without her permission. The character and theme were used in the \"[[Peterotica]]\" episode of ''[[Family Guy]]'' when the characters discuss the cleanliness of a porn shop and one of them states it is so clean because Burnett works there as a janitor. The charwoman is shown mopping the floor in the porn shop, and the characters subsequently discuss Burnett's ear tug and make a crude comment about it. Burnett and her company requested that Fox remove all references to her, the theme and the character but the studio did not.<ref name=\"Reut20th\">{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-burnett/carol-burnett-sues-tvs-family-guy-cartoon-idUSN1624604020070317 |title=Carol Burnett sues TV's \"Family Guy\" cartoon |work=[[Reuters]] |date=March 16, 2007 |accessdate=August 28, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Gun20th\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/celebrity/carol-burnett-v-family-guy |title=Carol Burnett v. \"Family Guy\" Comedian sues over porn shop spoof of beloved charwoman character |work=[[The Smoking Gun]] |date=March 16, 2018 |accessdate=August 28, 2018}}</ref> The suit was ruled in favor of the defendant because the bit was a parody, which is protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].

It was the first of its kind to be hosted by a woman.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://parade.com/451837/amyspencer/carol-burnett-first-woman-of-comedy/|title=Carol Burnett: First Woman of Comedy|last=Spencer|first=Amy|work=[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]|publisher=[[Athlon Media Group]]|date=January 22, 2016|accessdate=July 11, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/carol-burnett#| title=Interview: Carol Burnett| publisher=Archive of American Television| date=29 April 2003| last=Herman| first=Karen}}</ref> She has achieved success on stage, television and film in varying genres including dramatic and comedic roles. She has also appeared on various talk shows and as a panelist on game shows.\n\nBorn in [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]], Burnett moved with her grandmother to Hollywood, where she attended [[Hollywood High School]] and eventually studied theater and musical comedy at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]. Later she performed in nightclubs in New York City and had a breakout success on Broadway in 1959 in ''[[Once Upon a Mattress]]'', for which she received a [[Tony Award]] nomination. She soon made her television debut, regularly appearing on ''[[The Garry Moore Show]]'' for the next three years, and won her first [[Emmy Award]] in 1962. Burnett had her television special debut in 1963 when she starred as Calamity Jane in the Dallas State Fair Musicals production of ''[[Calamity Jane]]'' on [[CBS]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Billboard| date=July 29, 1963 |volume=75 |issue=26| page=24}}</ref> Burnett moved to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], and began an 11-year run as star of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' on [[CBS]] television from 1967 to 1978. With its [[vaudeville]] roots, ''The Carol Burnett Show'' was a [[variety show]] that combined [[sketch comedy|comedy sketches]] with song and dance. The comedy sketches included [[parody|film parodies]] and character pieces. Burnett created many memorable characters during the show's run, and both she and the show won numerous [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] and [[Golden Globe Award]]s.\n\nDuring and after her variety show, Burnett appeared in many television and film projects.

Gurney's ''[[Love Letters (play)|Love Letters]]''.\n\nBurnett had long been a fan of the soap opera ''[[All My Children]]'', and realized a dream when [[Agnes Nixon]] created the role of Verla Grubbs for her in 1976. Burnett played the long-lost daughter of Langley Wallingford ([[Louis Edmonds]]), causing trouble for her stepmother Phoebe Tyler-Wallingford ([[Ruth Warrick]]). She made occasional appearances on the soap opera in each decade thereafter. She hosted a 25th-anniversary special about the show in 1995 and made a brief [[cameo appearance]] as Verla Grubbs on the January 5, 2005, episode which celebrated the show's 35th anniversary. She reprised her role as Grubbs in September 2011 as part of the series' finale. \n\nShe also starred in television films such as ''[[Seasons of the Heart (1994 film)|Seasons of the Heart]]'' (1994). She also returned in 2005 to star in a different role as Queen Aggravain in the movie version of ''Once Upon a Mattress''. She guest-starred in season two of ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' as Bree's stepmother, Elanor Mason.\n\nIn 2009, she made a guest appearance on the ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]'', for which she was nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress \u2013 Drama Series|Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series]].

National Enquirer, Inc.}}\n\nIn 1976, a false report in the nation's leading supermarket [[tabloid journalism|tabloid]], ''[[The National Enquirer]],'' incorrectly implied that Burnett had been drunk and boisterous in public at a restaurant with U.S. Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] in attendance. The fact that both of her parents suffered from alcoholism made this a particularly sensitive issue to her.  Through years of persistent litigation, she won a judgment against the ''Enquirer'', in 1981.  Though the initial jury award of $1.6 million was reduced to $200,000 by a series of appeals, and the final settlement was out of court, the event was widely viewed as a historic victory for libel victims of [[tabloid journalism]].<ref name=\"carol_burnett_launches_1981_03_22_upi\">Scott, Vernon, [http://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/03/22/Carol-Burnett-launches-trial-balloon/6032354085200/ \"Carol Burnett launches trial balloon,\"], March 22, 1981, ''[[United Press International]] (UPI),'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"carol_burnett_given_1981_03_27_lindsey_nytimes\">Lindsey, Robert, [https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/27/us/carol-burnett-given-1.6-million-in-suit-against-national-enquirer.html \"Carol Burnett given 1.6 million in suit against National Enquirer,\"], March 27, 1981, ''[[The New York Times]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"how_tabloids_1991_01_04_nytimes\">[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/04/news/how-the-supermarket-tabloids-stay-out-of-court.html \"How the Supermarket Tabloids Stay Out of Court,\"] January 4, 1991, ''[[The New York Times]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"tabloids_lies_1991_08_12_langberg_nytimes\">Langberg, Barry (libel attorney for Carol Burnett and others), opinion essay: [http://articles.latimes.com/1991-08-12/entertainment/ca-468_1_tabloids \"Tabloids' Lies Abuse the First Amendment,\"] August 12, 1991, ,\"], ''[[The Los Angeles Times]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"tabloid_law_pt1_1999_08_atlantic\">Beam, Alex, [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/08/tabloid-law/377722/ \"Tabloid Law,\"] Part 1 of two parts, August 1999, ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"tabloid_law_pt2_1999_08_atlantic\">Beam, Alex, [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/08/tabloid-law/377722/ \"Tabloid Law,\"] Part 2 of two parts, August 1999, ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"dr_phil_2016_07_14_wash_post\">Andrews, Travis M., [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/07/14/dr-phil-and-wife-robin-sue-the-national-enquirer-for-250000-million-citing-defamation/ \"Dr_ Phil and wife Robin sue the National Enquirer for $250 million, citing defamation,\"] July 14, 2016, ''[[The Washington Post]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref>\n\nThe former longtime chief editor Iain Calder in his book ''The Untold Story'' asserted that after the Burnett lawsuit, while under his leadership, the ''Enquirer'' worked hard to check the reliability of its facts and its sources.\n\n'''Carol Burnett and Whacko, Inc. vs. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation'''\n\nIn 2007, Burnett and Whacko, Inc. brought a suit against [[20th Century Fox|Twentieth Century Fox]] requesting at least $2 million in damages, alleging copyright infringement, violation of publicity rights, and misappropriation of name and likeness due to the use of her charwoman character and an altered version of \"Carol's Theme\", the theme song used in ''The Carol Burnett Show'', without her permission. The character and theme were used in the \"[[Peterotica]]\" episode of ''[[Family Guy]]'' when the characters discuss the cleanliness of a porn shop and one of them states it is so clean because Burnett works there as a janitor.

During the Spanish Civil War, in early 1938, he went to the UK to deliver some lectures and this became the start of an exile that lasted till the end of his life.  He taught in the universities of Glasgow and Cambridge before moving in 1947 to the US.  In the 1950s he moved to Mexico.  While he continued to write poetry, he also published wide-ranging books of [[literary criticism|critical essays]], covering French, English and German as well as Spanish literature. He was frank about his [[homosexuality]] at a time when this was problematic and became something of a role model for this in Spain.  His collected poems were published under the title ''[[La realidad y el deseo]]''.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Seville and early life===\n\nCernuda was born in the Barrio Santa Cruz, Calle Conde de T\u00f3jar 6 (now Acetres),<ref name=\"Villena introduction11\">Villena intro to edition of Las Nubes p 11</ref> in Seville in 1902, the son of a colonel in the Regiment of Engineers.<ref name=\"Poesia completa\">Poes\u00eda completa: Cronolog\u00eda biogr\u00e1fica</ref>  He had two older sisters. The recollections and impressions of childhood contained in his poems, and the prose poems collected in ''Ocnos'', suggest that he was always a solitary, introverted, and timid child whose unhappiness in the family led to his living vicariously through books and through his strong visual impressions of his native city.<ref name=\"Connell201\">Connell p 201</ref>  His first encounter with poetry came at the age of 9 when he glanced through a copy of [[B\u00e9cquer]]'s ''Rimas'' that had been lent to his sisters by their cousins Luisa and Br\u00edgida de la Sota.<ref name=\"Cernuda625\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 625</ref>  Despite the fact that he later testified that this left no more than a dormant impression upon him, he began to write poetry himself during his studies at the Escolapios School in Seville from 1915 to 1919 around the age of 14.<ref name=\"hispanicexile.bham.ac.uk\">hispanicexile.bham.ac.uk/people/51</ref>  In 1914, the family moved into the Engineers' Barracks in the Prado, on the outskirts of Seville.  In 1918, they moved to Calle del Aire, where he would later write the poems of ''Perfil del aire''. \n[[Image:Casa natal de Luis Cernuda.jpg|thumb|Birthplace of Luis Cernuda in Seville]]\nIn 1919 he began to study Law at the [[University of Seville]], where, during his first year, he attended classes In Spanish Language and Literature given by [[Pedro Salinas]].  His extreme shyness prevented him from mentioning his literary activities until Salinas' notice was caught by a prose poem published in a student magazine.  He gave Cernuda encouragement and urged him to read both classical Spanish poetry and modern French literature.<ref name=\"Cernuda627\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 627</ref>  It was at Salinas' suggestion that Cernuda sent his first collection of poetry, ''Perfil del aire'', to [[Manuel Altolaguirre|Altolaguirre]] and [[Emilio Prados]], who had begun, late in 1926, to publish a magazine called ''[[Litoral]]''.  As was the practice in those days, many such magazines published collections of poetry as supplements.\n\nHis father died in 1920 and he continued to live at home with his mother and sisters.  In 1923 he did military service in the Regiment of Cavalry.<ref name=\"Poesia completa\" />  In 1924, as he was reaching the end of his undergraduate course, he participated in a series of meetings with a small group of fellow students in Salinas's house.  These stimulated his poetic vocation and helped to guide his readings of French literature.<ref name=\"Poesia completa\" />\n\nHe became a Bachelor of Law in September 1925 but was undecided about what to do next.  He thought about joining the diplomatic service but decided not to on discovering that it would entail a move to Madrid.<ref name=\"Poesia completa\" />   In October, Salinas arranged for him to make the acquaintance of [[Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez]] in the gardens of the [[Alc\u00e1zar of Seville]].<ref name=\"Poesia completa\" />\n\nIn January 1926, he made his first trip to Madrid, where Salinas was instrumental in arranging introductions to, among others, [[Ortega y Gasset]] - who had published some of his poems in his ''Revista de Occidente'' in December 1925 - [[Juan Chab\u00e1s]], [[Melchor Fern\u00e1ndez Almagro]], and [[Enrique D\u00edez-Canedo]];<ref name=\"hispanicexile.bham.ac.uk\"/> At the time his first book was being unfavourably received around April 1927, he was again in Madrid, at least for a while.<ref name=\"Poesia completa\" />  Although he later described himself at that time as ''inexperto, aislado en Sevilla'',<ref name=Cernuda629 /> he was in reality already known to a number of the influential Spanish literati of the period.  His indecision about a choice of career continued through 1926-27.  In December 1927, the [[Luis de G\u00f3ngora#G\u00f3ngora and the Generation of '27|G\u00f3ngora tercentenary celebrations]] reached a climax with a series of poetry readings and lectures at the [[Ateneo de Sevilla|Arts Club of Seville]] by people such as [[Garc\u00eda Lorca]], [[D\u00e1maso Alonso]], [[Rafael Alberti]], [[Jorge Guill\u00e9n]], [[Jos\u00e9 Bergam\u00edn]] and others.  Although he took no direct part in the proceedings, he did get the chance to read some of his poems and he made the acquaintance of Lorca.<ref name=\"Gibson200\">Gibson p 200</ref>\n\n===Madrid and France===\n\nHis mother died in July 1928 and, at the start of September, Cernuda left Seville.<ref name=\"Cernuda632\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 632</ref>  He spent a few days in M\u00e1laga with Altolaguirre, Prados and [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Hinojosa]] before moving to Madrid.  Although he had a law degree, he had no intention of making practical use of it.  He was starting to realise that poetry was the only thing that really mattered to him.<ref name=\"Cernuda633\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 633</ref>  He renewed acquaintance with Salinas and met [[Vicente Aleixandre]].  Salinas arranged for him to become the Spanish ''lector'' at the [[University of Toulouse]].  He took up post in November and stayed there for an academic year.<ref name=\"Poesia completa\" />  The experience of living on his own in a foreign city led him to a crucial realisation about himself:  his almost crippling shyness, his unhappiness in a family setting, his sense of isolation from the rest of humanity, had all been symptoms of a latent homosexuality which now manifested itself and which he accepted, in a spirit of defiance.<ref name=Connell202 />   This led to a decisive change in the type of poetry he wrote.  He also discovered a love of jazz and films, which seems to have activated an interest in the USA.<ref name=\"Cernuda636\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 636</ref>\n\nBetween his return from Toulouse in June 1929 to 1936, Cernuda lived in Madrid and participated actively in the literary and cultural scene of the Spanish capital.  At the start of 1930, he found a job in a bookshop owned by [[Le\u00f3n S\u00e1nchez Cuesta]].  All through this period, he worked with many organisations attempting to create a more liberal and tolerant Spain.  For example, between 1932 and 1935, he participated in the ''Misiones Pedag\u00f3gicas'' - a cultural outreach organisation set up by the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]].<ref name=\"Poesia completa\" />  He also contributed articles to radical journals such as ''Octubre'', edited by Alberti and his wife [[Mar\u00eda Teresa Le\u00f3n]], which could suggest at least a temporary adhesion to the Communist Party.<ref name=\"Gibbons intro 10\">Gibbons intro p 10</ref>   In June 1935, he took lodgings in Calle Viriato, Madrid, above the flat of Altolaguirre and his wife [[Concha M\u00e9ndez]].<ref name=\"Poesia completa\" />\n\nIn February 1936, he participated with Lorca and Alberti in an hommage to the Galician writer [[Valle-Incl\u00e1n]].<ref name=\"Poesia completa\" />   Since ''Perfil del aire'', he had only managed to publish one collection - ''Donde habite el olvido'' - in 1934, and a few individual poems.  This difficulty in getting published gave Cernuda the chance to revise and reflect on his work.  It also occurred to him in the meantime that he could bring all his poetry together under the title ''La realidad y el deseo''.<ref name=Cernuda641>Cernuda OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 641</ref>   In April 1936, [[Jos\u00e9 Bergam\u00edn]] published the book in his journal ''Cruz y Raya''.  Subsequent editions added new poems as separate books under this collective title.  On April 21, there was a celebratory dinner, attended by Lorca, Salinas, [[Pablo Neruda]], Altolaguirre, Alberti, Aleixandre and Bergam\u00edn himself.<ref name=Gibson432>Gibson p 432</ref>\n\n===Spanish Civil War===\n\nWhen the [[Spanish Civil War]] broke out, a friend of his, [[Concha de Albornoz]], arranged for him to join her in Paris as secretary to her father, the ambassador [[Alvaro de Albornoz]].  He remained there from July to September 1936, but after that he returned to Madrid along with the ambassador and his family.<ref name=\"Cernuda642\"/>\n\nFor perhaps the only time in his life Cernuda felt the desire to be useful, which he achieved by serving on the Republican side.<ref name=\"Cernuda642\">Cernuda: OCP Historial de un libro vol 1 p 642</ref>  He was hopeful that there was a possibility of righting some of the social injustices that he saw in Spanish society.  From October 1936 to April 1937, he participated in radio broadcasts with A. Serrano Plaja in the [[Sierra de Guadarrama]], north of Madrid.  In April 1937, he moved to Valencia and began to write poems that would be collected in ''Las Nubes''.  He also came into contact with [[Juan Gil-Albert]] and the other members of the editorial team behind the periodical ''Hora de Espa\u00f1a'' and began to work with them.<ref name=\"Poesia completa\" />   In June, he had trouble with a functionary from the Ministry of Education about a poem on the subject of Lorca - now dead - and had to remove a reference to the subject's homosexuality.<ref name=\"Poesia completa\" />  He played the role of Don Pedro in a performance of Lorca's play ''Mariana Pineda''<ref name=\"Poesia completa\" />  during the Second Congress of [[Anti-fascism|Anti-Fascist]] Intellectuals in [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]] in 1937.<ref name=\"hispanicexile.bham.ac.uk\"/>  At this time, he met [[Octavio Paz]].<ref name=\"Poesia completa\" />  In October, he returned to Madrid, where he remained until February 1938, working on the periodical ''El Mono Azul'', edited by Alberti and Mar\u00eda Teresa Le\u00f3n.\n\n===Exile in Britain===\n\nIn February 1938, an English friend, the poet Stanley Richardson, who died in [[the Blitz]] in 1941,<ref name=\"Stanley Richardson and Spain\">Stanley Richardson and Spain</ref> arranged for him to give a series of lectures in Oxford and Cambridge.  At the time, Cernuda thought that he would be away from Spain for one or two months, however this was to be the start of an exile that would last for the rest of his life.  The lectures never took place.  Richardson was well-connected, however, and arranged a party for him, attended by celebrities such as [[Katharine Stewart-Murray, Duchess of Atholl|the Duchess of Atholl]], [[Gavin Henderson, 2nd Baron Faringdon]], the Chinese ambassador, [[Rebecca West]] and [[Rose Macaulay]].  Even by then, the situation in Spain meant that it was not advisable for Cernuda to return and so Richardson suggested that he should join a colony of evacuated Basque children at [[Eaton Hastings]] on Faringdon's estate.<ref name=\"Murphy: Pub Poets\">Murphy: Pub Poets</ref>\n\nAfter a few months in England, penniless and barely able to speak English, he went to Paris with the intention of returning to Spain.  But he stayed on in Paris on receiving news of what was happening in his native land.<ref name=\"Cernuda644\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 644</ref>   In September 1938 Richardson secured him a position as Spanish assistant in [[Cranleigh School]].<ref name=\"Cernuda645\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 645</ref> In January 1939 he became the ''lector'' at the [[University of Glasgow]].\n\nNeither Glasgow nor Scotland appealed to him, which is perhaps noticeable in the downbeat tone of the poems he wrote there.  From 1941 onward, he spent his summer vacations in Oxford, where, despite the ravages of the war, there were plenty of well-stocked bookshops.  In August 1943, he moved to [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]], where he was much happier.<ref name=\"Cernuda648\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 648</ref>  In Seville he used to attend concerts and music had always been very important to him.  The artistic life of Cambridge and London made it easier for him to develop his musical knowledge. [[Mozart]] was the composer whose music meant the most to him<ref name=\"Cernuda649\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 649</ref> and he devoted a poem to him in his last collection, ''Desolaci\u00f3n de la Quimera''.\n\nIn 1940, while Cernuda was in Glasgow, Bergam\u00edn brought out in Mexico a second edition of ''La realidad y el deseo'', this time including section 7, ''Las nubes''.  A separate edition of this collection appeared in a pirated edition in Buenos Aires in 1943.  He had been afraid that the situation in Spain after the end of the Civil War would create such an unfavourable climate for writers who had gone into exile like him, that his work would be unknown to future generations.  The appearance of these two books was a ray of hope for him.<ref name=\"Cernuda647\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 647</ref>\n\nIn July 1945, he moved to a similar job at the Spanish Institute in London.  He regretted leaving Cambridge, despite the range and variety of theatres, concerts and bookshops in the capital.  He began to take his holidays in Cornwall because he was tired of the big city and urban life.<ref name=\"Cernuda651\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 651</ref>  So, in March 1947, when his old friend [[Concha de Albornoz]], who had been working at [[Mount Holyoke College]], [[Massachusetts]], wrote to offer him a post there, he accepted with alacrity.<ref name=\"Cernuda651\"/>  He managed to secure a passage on a French liner from Southampton to New York, where he arrived on September 10.  He was coming from a country that was impoverished, still showing many signs of war damage and subject to rationing so the shops of New York made it seem as if he were arriving in an earthly paradise.<ref name=\"Cernuda654\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 654</ref>  He also responded favourably to the people and wealth of Mount Holyoke where, ''for the first time in my life, I was going to be paid at a decent and fitting level''.<ref name=\"Cernuda654\"/>\n\n===US and Mexico===\n\nAlthough he was happy in Mount Holyoke, at the end of the 1947-48 year, a student advised him not to stay there and he himself began to wonder whether it was a beneficial force on his poetry.<ref name=\"Cernuda655\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 655</ref>  In the summer of 1949 he paid his first visit to Mexico and was so impressed that Mount Holyoke began to seem irksome.  This can be seen in the collection of prose ''Variaciones sobre tema mexicano'', which he wrote in the winter of 1949-50.<ref name=\"Cernuda655\"/>  He began to spend his summers in Mexico and in 1951, during a 6-month sabbatical, he met X (identified by Cernuda only as Salvador), the inspiration for ''Poemas para un cuerpo'', which he started to write at that time.<ref name=\"Cernuda656\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 656</ref>  This was probably the happiest period of his life.\n\n[[File:UNAM Biblioteca Central.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.75|The Central Library - University of Mexico.]]\nScarcely had he met X than his Mexican visa expired and he returned to the US via Cuba.  It became impossible for him to continue living in Mount Holyoke: the long winter months, the lack of sun, the snow all served to depress him.  On his return from vacation in 1952, he resigned from his post,<ref name=\"hispanicexile.bham.ac.uk\"/> giving up a worthy position, a decent salary, and life in a friendly and welcoming country that offered him a comfortable and convenient lifestyle.  He had always had a restless temperament, a desire to travel to new places.  Only love had the power to overcome this need and make him feel at home in a place, to overcome his sense of isolation.  In this, there is perhaps a clue as to one of the reasons that he was attracted to the surrealists - the belief in the overwhelming power of love.  In addition, he always had a powerful attraction to beautiful young men.<ref name=\"Cernuda659\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 659</ref>  He also had a constant urge to go against the grain of any society in which he found himself.  This helped him not to fall into provincial ways during his youth in Seville, whose inhabitants thought they were living at the centre of the world rather than in a provincial capital.  It also helped to immunise him against the airs and graces of Madrid or any other place in which he lived.<ref name=Cernuda659 />\n\nIn November 1952, he settled in Mexico<ref name=Cernuda660>Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 660</ref>  with his old friends Concha M\u00e9ndez and Altolaguire<ref name=hispanicexile.bham.ac.uk />(although since they had separated in 1944 and later divorced, Cernuda probably stayed with Concha).  Between 1954 and 1960 he was a lecturer at the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]].  In 1958, the third edition of ''La realidad y el deseo'' was published in Mexico. For this edition Cernuda wrote an essay ''Historial de un libro'' which considers his work in order ''to see not so much how I made my poems but rather, as Goethe said, how they made me''.<ref name=Cernuda660 />  In 1958, Altolaguirre died and Cernuda took on the job of editing his poetry.  His two sisters died in 1960.<ref name=\"Poesia completa\" />\n\nIn June 1960, he lectured at [[UCLA]] and became friendly with Carlos Otero, who was presenting a doctoral thesis on Cernuda's poetry that year.  This stay seems to have revitalised Cernuda and, on his return to Mexico, he began to write poetry again.  The poems he wrote in the autumn and winter of 1960-61 form the nucleus of his final collection, ''Desolaci\u00f3n de la Quimera'', which he completed in San Francisco a few months later.  From August 1961 to June 1962, he gave courses at [[San Francisco State College]].  After a brief return to Mexico, he made his third and final visit to California in September 1962, where he was a visiting professor at UCLA until June 1963.  He spent the summer of 1963 in Mexico and, although he had an invitation to lecture at the [[University of Southern California]], he declined it in August, because of the need to undergo a medical in order to extend his visa.  He died in Concha M\u0117ndez's house of a heart attack on November 5, 1963.  He was buried in the [[Pante\u00f3n Jard\u00edn]], Mexico City.<ref name=\"Poesia completa\" />   He never married and had no children.\n\n==Poetry==\n\nLuis Cernuda was one of the most dedicated poets amongst the members of the Generation of 1927.<ref name=Connell202>Connell p 202</ref>   Salinas, Guill\u00e9n, Diego and D\u00e1maso Alonso were as well known for their teaching activities and their critical writings as for their poetry.  Altolaguirre and Prados are probably remembered more for their printing work than for their literary output.  Alberti enjoyed fame for his political activism and Lorca was possibly as gifted in drama and music as he was in poetry.  Cernuda drifted into university teaching simply as a way of earning a living and never held a prestigious post.  Everything in his life was incidental to his work as a poet.  His published criticism is valuable for the insights it gives into his development as a poet - he tends to discuss the authors and works that had most influence on his poetry and thinking.  The development of his poetry from first to last is dictated by the development of his character and not by literary fashion - although his personal crisis, depicted in ''Un r\u00edo, un amor'', does coincide with the personal crises experienced by Alberti, Lorca and Aleixandre.<ref name=Connell202 />  The collective title he chose for his poetry, ''La realidad y el deseo'',  refers to the conflict that is its primary theme. He wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Desire led me towards the reality that offered itself to my eyes as if only through possession of it might I be able to achieve certainty about my own life.  But since I have only ever achieved a precarious grip on it, there comes the opposite tendency, that of hostility to the ironic attractiveness of reality...And so, in my view, the essence of the problem of poetry is the conflict between reality and desire, between appearance and truth, permitting us to achieve some glimpse of the complete image of the world that we do not know.<ref name=Cernuda602>Cernuda OCP vol 1 Palabras antes de una lectura p 602</ref></blockquote>\n\nA significant stage of his development occurred in 1923-24, when he was doing military service.  Every afternoon, along with the other recruits, he had to ride round the outskirts of Seville.  One afternoon, he had an epiphanic experience as if he were seeing things for the first time.  He also felt an uncontrollable need to describe this experience.  This led to the writing of a whole series of poems which have not survived.<ref name=\"Cernuda626\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 626</ref>\n[[Image:The Chapel Emmanuel College2.jpg|thumb|Emmanuel College, Cambridge]]\nAnother crucial phase of his development was his residence in Great Britain between 1938 and 1947.  He learned English and read widely in English literature.  He seems to have had a sense that he was predestined to read English poetry and that it corrected and completed something that was lacking both in his poetry and in himself.<ref name=\"Cernuda645\"/>  He began to see his work in the classroom as analogous to the writing of poetry - the poet should not simply try to communicate the effect of an experience but to direct the reader to retrace the process by which the poet had come to experience what he is writing about.  His attitude to Britain was ambivalent.  He learned a lot from the literature and greatly admired certain aspects of the national character, as displayed in wartime, but found it hard to summon up affection for the country and its people.<ref name=\"Cernuda649-50\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 649-50</ref>  He tried to sum up his ambivalent feelings in the poem \"La partida\", but he considered that he failed to do justice to the theme.<ref name=\"Cernuda653\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 653</ref>\n\n===Collections===\n\n====Primeras poes\u00edas (1924\u20131927)====\n\nThis was the title that Cernuda gave in ''La realidad y el deseo'' to the revised version of his first published work ''Perfil del aire'', which had been published by ''Litoral'' in April 1927.  The collection was dedicated to Salinas, and Cernuda sent a copy to him in Madrid, where he was spending the university vacation.  Cernuda later recalled that this book was greeted by a stream of hostile reviews that tended to concentrate on a perceived lack of novelty and on its indebtedness to Guill\u00e9n.  It also really stung him that Salinas merely sent back a brief acknowledgement of receipt of the book.<ref name=Cernuda629>Cernuda OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 629</ref> He dealt with the apparent debt to Guill\u00e9n in an essay in 1948, in which he points out that in 1927, Guill\u00e9n had yet to publish a collection.  During the 1920s, Guill\u00e9n had published poems here and there in various magazines - including 12 in two separate editions of the ''Revista de Occidente'' in 1924 and 1925 - but this is scarcely sufficient evidence to demonstrate significant influence, given that in December 1925 he himself had had 9 poems published in ''Revista de Occidente''.  His conclusion is that both of them were influenced by the works of Mallarm\u00e9 - in the case of Guill\u00e9n this influence was transmitted via Val\u00e9ry - and shared an interest in pure poetry.<ref name=Cernuda607>Cernuda OCP vol 1 El cr\u00edtico, el amigo y el poeta p 607-624</ref> [[Jos\u00e9 Bergam\u00edn]], however, published a favourable review and Guill\u00e9n himself sent him a letter praising the work and urging him to ignore the reviews.<ref name=Villena15>Villena intro to edition of Las Nubes p 15</ref>  Nevertheless, he was never able to forget the criticism that this work had engendered.  He was too thin-skinned for that.\n\nThe revision process removed ten poems and also some of the stylistic elements that might have triggered comparisons to Guill\u00e9n - such as the use of exclamations and the rhetorical device apostrophe - but in reality the poets are very different in tone.  Guill\u00e9n reaches out joyfully and confidently to reality whereas Cernuda is more hesitant - the world might be an exciting place but something holds him back.<ref name=Connell203 />  Like Guill\u00e9n, Cernuda uses strict metrical forms in this collection, such as the ''d\u00e9cima'' and the sonnet, and there is also an intellectual quality far removed from the folkloric elements that were being used by poets such as Alberti and Lorca, but the emotional restraint is far removed from the world of ''C\u00e1ntico''.  The change of title suggests a recent desire to strip artifice away from his poetry.<ref name=\"Cernuda630\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 630</ref>  There are already poems that reject the real world in favour of a love that will lead to oblivion.  The poet wants to find a place to hide from the world of reality, fully aware that such a retreat or escape can only be temporary.<ref name=Connell203>Connell p 203</ref>  The overriding mood is one of adolescent melancholy.  The debt to Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez is also strong.<ref name=\"Harris notes to Un rio\">Harris intro to Un r\u00edo, un amor etc p 13</ref>\n\n====Egloga, Eleg\u00eda, Oda (1927\u20131928)====\n\nAfter the set-back of the critical reception of ''Perfil del aire'', Cernuda decided to cultivate precisely those things that had been criticised, especially the lack of novelty.  He wrote an eclogue, heavily influenced by his favourite Spanish poet [[Garcilaso de la Vega (poet)|Garcilaso]].  This was published in the first issue of a magazine called ''Carmen'' and was received very favourably by [[Salvador de Madariaga]].  This was followed by an elegy and then by an ode.  Although he came to recognise that writing these poems had helped his technical fluency, he realised that there was something essential that these formal exercises did not allow him to express.<ref name=\"Cernuda631\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 631</ref>  However, he was encouraged to learn that it was possible to write poems of much greater length than was customary at that time, which was an important discovery for him.  In ''Historial de un libro'', he states that at this time he was trying to find an [[objective correlative]] for what he was experiencing - one of the many indications of the influence of [[TS Eliot]] on his work, although this is a rationalisation after the fact because he had yet to read Eliot.<ref name=\"Cernuda632\"/>\n\nThis small group of poems can be read as Cernuda's participation in the G\u00f3ngora tercentenary celebrations - except that he chose to evoke the memories of Garcilaso's eclogues and Luis de Le\u00f3n's odes.<ref name=\"Poesia completa51\">Derek Harris: Introduction to Poes\u00eda completa p 51</ref>  However, their influence is evident only on the form of these poems - the subject-matter is more obviously influenced by Mallarm\u00e9.  The languorous mood recalls \"L'apr\u00e8s-midi d'un Faune\".  There are hints of the poet's admiration for Greek mythology and also of his interest in male physical beauty.<ref name=Connell203 />\n\n====Un r\u00edo, un amor (1929)====\n\nCernuda started work on this collection during his period in Toulouse.  He visited Paris in the Easter vacation of 1929 and was bowled over by the museums and the book-stalls. He spent his days soaking up the sights.  One day, back in Toulouse, he wrote \"Remordimiento en traje de noche\" and discovered a style that enabled him to express poetic needs that he had not been able to communicate up till then.  He had not written any poetry since before his arrival in Toulouse in 1928 but he produced the first 3 poems of the new collection in quick succession. His dissatisafaction with the conventions of fashionable poetry had been freed by contact with surrealism, which for him was not just a literary phenomenon but the expression of an attitude against conformity.<ref name=\"Cernuda634\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 634</ref>  He continued work on this collection after his return to Madrid.\n\nThe influence of the Surrealists is shown by the complexity of the free-flowing imagery, some of it inspired by random discoveries such as the title of a jazz record (as a jazz fan, he used to scour record catalogues and was intrigued by titles such as \"I want to be alone in the South\"), the name of an American city such as Durango or Daytona, a title card from a silent film, or an image from a talking picture such as [[White Shadows in the South Seas]] which he had seen in Paris.  The metrical schemes and rhyme patterns of the first two collections are largely abandoned; only a few of the poems in this book are written in alexandrine quatrains.  Such metrical regularity is not a feature of most surrealist poetry.<ref name=Connell204>Connell p 204</ref>  This was the first collection in which he made use of what he calls free verse.  In reality, this amounts to ignoring classical Spanish verse forms and rhyme schemes, such as ''letrillas'' - in fact, from this point on Cernuda rarely uses full rhyme or even assonance - even though he often felt a need to write in a lyrical style.<ref name=\"Cernuda635\">Cernuda. OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 635</ref>  In a poem such as \"\u00bfSon todos felices?\", Cernuda makes it clear what attracted him to the Surrealists, their protest against society and the pressure to conform.  In this poem, honour, patriotism and duty are seen as worthless in comparison to the suffering they inflict on the rebel or non-conformist.  Just being alive and living according to the rules is equivalent to being dead.  It is noteworthy that this poem contains the first unequivocal expression of homoerotic attraction in his poetry.<ref name=\"Harris notes to Un rio82\">Harris notes to Un r\u00edo, un amor p 82</ref>  The collection, like its successor, remained unpublished until 1936, when they were gathered into the first edition of ''La realidad y el deseo''.\n\n====Los placeres prohibidos (1931)====\n\nThe poems gathered in this and the previous collection came to Cernuda fully formed.  The poems that eventually got published were the same as the first drafts, which was very different from his experience with his first two collections.<ref name=\"Cernuda637\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 637</ref>\n\nThe poet's homosexuality is made defiantly manifest in this collection.  However, the title of the work suggests that there were other \"forbidden pleasures\" and he explores various ways of defying the norms of bourgeois behaviour.  It is the product of an intensive period of literary production between April and June 1931, when Alfonso XIII abdicated and the Spanish Republic was proclaimed.<ref name=\"Harris notes to Un rio85\">Harris notes to Un r\u00edo etc p 85</ref>  In \"Dir\u00e9 c\u00f3mo nacisteis\", Cernuda launches a war cry against a society in decay that represses and imprisons people who transgress the social norms of love.  And in the next poem, \"Telara\u00f1as cuelgan de la raz\u00f3n\", he sets up the other major mood of the collection, an elegiac mood of sorrow.<ref name=\"Harris notes to Un rio89\">Harris notes to Un r\u00edo etc p 89</ref> The poems in this book draw a distinction between the poet's freedom of imagination and the accepted rules of life that confine and limit his freedom.<ref name=Connell205>Connell p 205</ref>  The predominant tone is one of desolation, recalling the transitory nature of love and the emptiness it leaves in its wake.  In \"De qu\u00e9 pa\u00eds\", Cernuda looks at a newborn child and depicts the betrayal of his sense of wonder and innocence by the way the adult world imposes artificial codes of behaviour and a sense of guilt when the code is transgressed.  It is a theme that is explored many times in his oeuvre.\n\n====Donde habite el olvido (1932\u20131933)====\n\nThis book resulted from a love affair that ended badly.  Derek Harris has identified the other man as Seraf\u00edn F. Ferro.<ref name=\"Poesia completa\" />  In \"Aprendiendo olvido\", one of the prose poems included in ''Ocnos'', Cernuda alludes to this episode.  In later years, he was embarrassed by the candour with which he treated it, attributing this to the slowness of his emotional development, and admitted that this section of his oeuvre was one of the least-satisfying for him.<ref name=\"Cernuda639\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 639</ref>\n\nIn this collection, Cernuda steps away from surrealism, feeling that what was lying around hidden in the depths of his subconscious had been dredged sufficiently.  Instead of what he had come to see as the artifice and triviality of hermetic images deriving from the flow of thoughts through the poet's mind, he turned to the example of the 19thc. poet [[Gustavo Adolfo B\u00e9cquer]], who produced tightly controlled poetry on the subject of lost love.<ref name=\"Cernuda639\"/>  Cernuda continued to eschew rhyme and assonance but, like B\u00e9cquer's ''Rimas'' the stanzas are short and self-contained and their language is restrained.<ref name=Connell206>Connell p 206</ref>  Sometimes, the poems return to the world of the ''Primeras poes\u00edas''.\n\nIn \"III\", the theme is the emptiness left by the passing of love - just as in \"Telara\u00f1as cuelgan de la raz\u00f3n\" from ''Los placeres prohibidos'' - but rendered in a much simpler, more lyrical fashion.  \"IV\" shows how the dreams and aspirations of youth are destroyed when they soar too high - probably a reference to the myth of Icarus.  \"VII\" returns to the enclosed world of the early poems, suggesting that despite all his experiences the poet is still an unfulfilled dreamer. \"XII\" suggests that love alone makes life real.  It persists as a universal force even though it might have died in a particular individual.<ref name=Connell206 />  The ideas behind surrealism are still present, although the presentation of them is markedly different.\n\n====Invocaciones (1934\u20131935)====\n\nThis collection was originally called ''Invocaciones a las gracias del mundo'' but Cernuda later shortened it to make it seem less pompous.  Tired with the habitual brevity of poems in the tradition of [[Antonio Machado]] or Jim\u00e9nez, he starts to write much longer poems than hitherto.  When he started work on these poems, he realised that their subject-matter needed greater length for him to be able to express everything he needed to say about them.  He cast off all the remaining traces of \"pure\" poetry.<ref name=\"Cernuda640\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 640</ref>  He also notes, however, that there is a tendency to ramble at the beginning of certain poems in this book as well as a degree of bombast.\n\nHis principal subject-matter is still essentially himself and his thoughts but he starts to view things in a more objective way: the poetry is more analytical.  For example, in \"Soliloquio del farero\",  the poet finds an escape from desperation in an enclosed and solitary world very similar to that of his earliest poems.  The poem is addressed to his \"friend\" - solitude - and he develops the idea that he has been chosen to serve mankind in some way by being separated from them, just like a lighthouse-keeper. Other poems in the collection allude to Greek mythology or a golden age of innocence that has been lost.<ref name=Connell206 />  Early in 1935, Cernuda made the acquaintance of Stanley Richardson and dedicated \"Por unos tulipanes amarillos\" to him.<ref name=\"Stanley Richardson and Spain\" />\n\n====Las nubes (1937\u20131940)====\n\nThis collection was written during the Spanish Civil War and amidst all the disruption and uncertainty in Cernuda's life as he went into exile, drifting from Madrid, to London, to Paris, to Cranleigh and finally to Glasgow.  Meditations about his isolation in foreign countries and about Spain, particularly about his growing feeling that nothing in Spain was going to change for the better and that intolerance, ignorance and superstition were winning the struggle,<ref name=Cernuda642 />  are the major themes.  Stylistically, there is an increased concentration on clarity and simplicity of diction and his control over his means of expression is growing.<ref name=Connell207 />   He often uses combinations of 7 and 11 syllable lines.\n\nWhen he left Madrid in February 1938, he took 8 new poems with him.<ref name=\"Cernuda645\"/>   In London, he wrote 6 more.  He wrote \"L\u00e1zaro\" while [[Neville Chamberlain|Chamberlain]] and [[Hitler]] were negotiating about Czechoslovakia, and the poem is written in a mood of melancholy calm, trying to express the disenchanted surprise that a dead man might feel on being brought back to life.<ref name=\"Cernuda646\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 646</ref>  During his stay with the colony of evacuated Basque children at Eaton Hastings, he befriended a boy called I\u00f1aki who had quickly mastered English and showed such promise that Lord Faringdon was prepared to finance his education at a private school - an offer refused by the boy on political grounds, according to the story told by Cernuda to his fellow \u00e9migr\u00e9 Rafael Mart\u00ednez Nadal.  Shortly afterwards, the boy fell ill and was taken to the [[Radcliffe Infirmary]].  On March 27, he was close to death.  He refused the last sacraments and turned away from the crucifix held out by a priest.  He wanted to see Cernuda, however, and asked him to read a poem.  He then turned to the wall and died.  This was the inspiration for the poem \"Ni\u00f1o muerto\", written in May 1938.<ref name=\"Murphy: Pub Poets\"/>\n\nA key poem in the collection is \"A Larra, con unas violetas (1837-1937)\", in which he identifies himself with [[Mariano Jos\u00e9 de Larra]], the brilliant, satirical journalist of 19thc. Madrid. Larra was a fierce critic of the governments of his day and of the state of Spanish society but was at heart very patriotic.  Cernuda sees in Larra a kindred spirit, embittered, misunderstood, isolated and unsuccessful in love.<ref name=Connell207>Connell p 207</ref>\n\n====Como quien espera el alba (1941\u20131944)====\n\nThis work was begun during his 1941 vacation in Oxford, continued in Glasgow and completed at Cambridge in 1944.  The autumn, winter and spring of 1941-2 was one of the most fertile periods of his life and it seems that this collection was one of his favourites.<ref name=\"Cernuda648\"/>  He read widely in English poetry and criticism and made acquaintance with the writings of TS Eliot, Dr Johnson, Coleridge, Matthew Arnold and Keats's letters amongst others.<ref name=\"Cernuda647\"/>  He also began to read Goethe and Kierkegaard.<ref name=\"Cernuda649\"/>  Whilst this extensive reading does not show through specifically in any poem, his handling of longer poems is more assured.<ref name=Connell207 />  There are poems that suggest a nostalgia for the Seville of his youth - not an emotion that Cernuda often displays, but a longing for bright sunshine and warmth is easily explicable in the circumstances.  It is only in such indirect ways that a reader can sense what was happening around him. Glasgow was bombed 5 times by the [[Luftwaffe]] in [[the Blitz]] and suffered extensive damage but it would be impossible to gather this from reading Cernuda.\n\nIn an extended poem, \"Noche del hombre y su demonio\", he reflects on the course of his life and the possibility of being remembered after his death.<ref name=Connell208>:Connell p 208</ref>   The ''demonio'' attacks the concept of the poet's vocation and suggests that Cernuda might sometimes have been tempted to try to live a normal life.  \"G\u00f3ngora\" is another poem that takes a historical figure and projects the poet's own psychological state onto him.\n\nThe title of the collection alludes to the atmosphere of Britain during the Second World War when \"it was only possible to hope for an end to the world's retreat into a primitive world of darkness and terror, in the middle of which England was like the ark in which Noah survived the flood.\"<ref name=\"Cernuda649\"/>\n\n====Vivir sin estar viviendo (1944\u20131949)====\n\nBegun in Cambridge, continued in London and completed in America, this is very similar to the previous collection in that it contains a mix of introspective and self-analytical works and shorter impressionist poems.  As a result of his reading of H\u00f6lderlin, Cernuda had started to use [[enjambement]].  His increasing use of this device gave his poetry a duality of rhythm - the rhythm of the individual line and the rhythm of the phrase.  Since he tended not to use rhyme or even assonance, the rhythm of the line tends to be swamped by that of the phrase, resulting in an effect that is often close to prose.<ref name=\"Cernuda650\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 650</ref>\n\nThe first eight poems were written in Cambridge and he added another 13 which he wrote during holidays in Cornwall.  The title alludes to the state of mind in which he found himself at that time - living vicariously in foreign countries where he scarcely knew anybody.  His voracious reading was taking the place of living.  He could see nothing ahead of him but death.<ref name=\"Cernuda656\" />\n\n====Con las horas contadas (1950\u20131956)====\n\nThis collection was started in Mount Holyoke during the winter of 1950 and completed in Mexico.  One of the most noteworthy things about this book is that it contains a group of poems - ''Poemas para un cuerpo'' - about an intensely physical affair he had with an unidentified man in Mexico.  The title suggests not merely Cernuda's obsession with the passing of time but also the sense of strangeness he felt whilst living this amorous adventure - an old man in love as he describes himself.<ref name=\"Cernuda658\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 658</ref>  As already stated, this was one of the happiest times in his life.  The bulk of the poems in the collection are shorter than in previous books and start to incorporate assonance more frequently in an attempt to concentrate the thematic material rather than explore it at length and also to seem more purely lyrical.<ref name=Cernuda658 />\n\n\"El elegido\" is an objective account of the choosing, preparation and killing of an Aztec sacrificial victim.  It is recounted in very simple language but it clearly picks up on the thoughts behind the soliloquy in ''Invocaciones''. The poem presents an allegory of the choosing, beguilement and final destruction of the poet by life or the \"daimonic\" power.<ref name=Connell208 />\n\n====Desolaci\u00f3n de la Quimera (1956\u20131962)====\n\nCernuda's last book of poems is a summing up of his career.  It was published in Mexico in November 1962.<ref name=\"Poesia completa\" />   It mingles poems in the style of his first book with epigrammatic works and extended reveries in his mature style.  There are poems that are derived from song-titles or catch-phrases - \"Otra vez, con sentimiento\" - and historical poems about figures such as Mozart, Verlaine and Rimbaud, Keats, Goethe, Ludwig of Bavaria.  In \"Ni\u00f1o tras un cristal\", he completes a cycle of poems about the unawareness and hope of a child before its corruption by the world - a theme present right from the start of his poetic career.<ref name=Connell208 />\n\nIt is clear that he knew that his life was coming to a close and he wanted to settle his accounts.  This is shown by the titles of poems such as \"Antes de irse\", \"Dos de noviembre\", \"Del otro lado\", \"Ep\u00edlogo\" and \"Despedida\".  There are direct links to previous collections.  For example, \"Ep\u00edlogo\" is explicitly related to the ''Poemas para un cuerpo'',  and \"Pregunta vieja, vieja respuesta\" links back to ''Donde habite el olvido''.<ref name=\"Villena introduction43\">Villena intro to Las Nubes etc p 43</ref>\n\nHe also returns to the theme of Spain, which had first appeared in ''Las nubes'', analysing what he admires and dislikes.<ref name=\"Villena introduction44\">Villena intro to Las Nubes etc p 44</ref>  There are poems about other poets he knew, sometimes splenetic in tone.  The major theme is, however, that of the impossibility of finding happiness in a world where desire and reality diverge - cf \"Hablando a Manona\", \"Luna llena en Semana Santa\", or \"M\u00fasica cautiva\".<ref name=\"Villena introduction55\">Villena intro to Las Nubes etc p 55</ref>  However, he does find some kind of consolation in the realm of art - listening to Mozart's music, or considering the world of Goethe compared with that of Napoleon's drunken soldiers.<ref name=\"Villena introduction55\" />  Also, by this time, he had gathered some degree of fame in Spain and there were signs that people were responding to his writings.  In \"Peregrino\", he reacts to enquiries about whether he might return to his homeland in a characteristically grumpy way which shades into a tone of resolute stoicism as he explains that he is driven to keep moving forward and can never return to the past.<ref name=Connell209>Connell p 209</ref>\n\n===Influences===\n\nIt was at the urging of Pedro Salinas that Cernuda began to read classical Spanish poets such as [[Garcilaso de la Vega (poet)|Garcilaso]], [[Luis de Le\u00f3n]], [[Luis de G\u00f3ngora|G\u00f3ngora]], [[Lope de Vega]], [[Francisco de Quevedo|Quevedo]] and [[Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca|Calder\u00f3n de la Barca]].  He also urged him to learn French and to read modern French literature, in particular [[Andr\u00e9 Gide]] and the poetry of [[Baudelaire]], [[St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9|Mallarm\u00e9]] and [[Rimbaud]].<ref name=\"Cernuda627\"/>  Cernuda also became acquainted with the poetry of [[Pierre Reverdy]] and counts him as a major influence over the poems in his first collection, ''Perfil del aire'', for his qualities of spareness, purity and reticence.<ref name=\"Cernuda627\"/>  No contemporary critic recognised this influence.  In ''Un r\u00edo, un amor'', ''Destierro'' echoes Reverdy's poetry in its evocation of a solitary existence in a hostile urban world.<ref name=\"Harris notes to Un rio55\">Harris notes to Un r\u00edo etc p 55</ref>   He also read [[Comte de Lautr\u00e9amont|Lautr\u00e9amont]]'s ''Les Chants de Maldoror'' and ''Pr\u00e9face a un livre futur'', although their influence emerged at a later time.\n\nJust before he completed ''Perfil del aire'', in March 1926, the Madrid book-seller Le\u00f3n S\u00e1nchez Cuesta had already delivered to him a copy of ''Le Libertinage'' by Louis Aragon.<ref name=\"Harris notes to Un rio\" /> In the time just after the publication of ''Perfil del aire'', he began to read other books by the leaders of the [[Surrealist]] movement - [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]], [[Paul Eluard]], [[Louis Aragon]] and [[Ren\u00e9 Crevel]]. He strongly identified with their boldness and their sense of alienation from their society<ref name=\"Cernuda632\"/> and this emerges clearly in his third and fourth collections.\n\nWhile he was halfway through writing the poems of ''Invocaciones'', he began to read [[H\u00f6lderlin]], which he describes as one of his greatest experiences in poetry.<ref name=\"Cernuda640\"/>  He had grown tired of the very restricted range of literature championed by the French surrealists and was starting to interest himself in English and German poetry.  In order to read them, he began to learn these languages.  He was enthralled by the depth and poetic beauty that he discovered in H\u00f6lderlin and discovered not just a new vision of the world but also a new means of poetic expression.<ref name=\"Cernuda641\"/>\nDuring his stay in Paris in 1936, he bought a copy of the [[Greek Anthology]] in a French translation.  He was stimulated by the concise and penetrating style of these poems and epigrams.<ref name=\"Cernuda642\"/>\n\nAfter his move to Great Britain in September 1938, Cernuda continued the exploration of English literature that he had begun the previous spring.  While he was reading Eliot, Blake, Keats, Shakespeare's plays, he was struck by their lack of verbal ornamentation compared with Spanish and French poetry.  He discovered that a poet could achieve a deeper poetic effect by not shouting or declaiming, or repeating himself, by avoiding bombast and grandiloquence.  As in those epigrams in the Greek anthology, he admired the way that concision could give a precise shape to a poem.  He learned to avoid two literary vices, the [[pathetic fallacy]] and \"purple patches\", avoiding undue subjectivity or features that did not fit in with the overall conception of the poem.<ref name=\"Cernuda646\"/>  The tendencies had been there, to gradually increasing extent, in his poetry from the outset but his reading confirmed him on this route.  He also read [[Robert Browning|Browning]] and learned how to take a dramatic, historic or legendary situation and to project his own emotional state onto it, in order to achieve greater objectivity, as in poems such as ''L\u00e1zaro, Quetzalc\u00f3atl, Silla del Rey'', or ''El C\u00e9sar''.<ref name=\"Cernuda647\"/>  In a study of Cernuda's influences, E.M. Wilson suggests that, soon after his arrival in England, he began to emulate the way that [[T.S. Eliot|T.S. Eliot]] borrows and alludes to works by other writers.  He provides examples of such possible borrowings from Rodrigo Caro, Baudelaire, Luis de Le\u00f3n and Quevedo.  He also suggests that Lope de Vega and George Herbert were the sources for another 2 poems.  Eliot's influence is also suggested by an essay by Octavio Paz - ''La palabra edificante''.\n \nAt Mount Holyoke he started to read ''Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker (The Fragments of the Presocratics)'' by [[Hermann Diels]] with the help of an English translation.  In Mexico, he read [[John Burnet (classicist)|John Burnet]]'s ''Early Greek Philosophy''.  These fragments of pre-Socratic thought seemed to him the most profound and poetic philosophical works he had ever read.  The world of ancient Greece is often recalled in his poetry.<ref name=\"Cernuda657\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 657</ref>  It recalled his childhood reading of a book of Greek mythology which, even at that early age, had been sufficient to make his religious beliefs seem sad and depressing.  He tried to express something of that experience in ''El poeta y los mitos'' in ''Ocnos''.<ref name=Cernuda657 />\n\n===Poetics:  the role of the poet and poetry===\n\nCernuda's poetry shows a continual process of stripping away artifice and modish elements.  This accounts in part for the abrupt changes in style and tone between various collections.  He was also convinced that a poet needs to gain as much variety of experience and knowledge as possible, otherwise his work will be pallid and restricted.<ref name=\"Cernuda639\"/>  A poet's work should reflect his growth, his intellectual and emotional development.\n\nWhen he describes things, it is his individual perception of them that he is trying to convey, what they mean to him, rather than their objective existence.  However, after his early collections, he rarely uses the first-person.  He frequently tries to create a sense of distance from his poetry by using the \"t\u00fa\" form but the person he is addressing is usually himself.  The effect of this is that much of his poetry seems to be a self-conscious interior monologue.<ref name=\"Gibbons intro 13\" />   In part, this is because he was always conscious of a difference between the Cernuda who lived and suffered and the Cernuda who wrote poetry.<ref name=Cernuda625 /> In part, it is also probably a result of his natural reticence and caution against disclosing too much of himself, despite the fact that personal history lies behind much of his output.  Whereas Browning might use a figure such as [[Fra Lippo Lippi (poem)|Fra Lippo Lippi]] or [[Andrea del Sarto (poem)|Andrea del Sarto]] to live imaginatively what he would not present as his own experience, Cernuda's characters have Cernuda's voice and present versions or aspects of his own thoughts and feelings.<ref name=\"Gibbons intro 13\">Gibbons intro to Selected Poems p 13</ref>\n\nHe was convinced that he was driven by an inner daimon to write poetry and that the poet is in touch with a spiritual dimension of life that normal people are either blind to or shut off from.<ref name=Cernuda604>Cernuda OCP vol 1 Palabras antes de una lectura p 604</ref>  it is a topic which he alludes to frequently in his critical writings.  His urge to write poetry was not under his control.  Reading some lines of poetry, hearing some notes of music, seeing an attractive person could be the external influence that led to a poem but what was important was to try to express the real, deep-lying poetic impulse, which was sometimes powerful enough to make him shiver or burst into tears.<ref name=\"Cernuda638\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 638</ref>\n\nAlthough he was a self-absorbed person, dedicated to the art of writing poetry, he was vulnerable enough to need to know that he had an audience.  After November 1947, when an edition of ''Como quien espera el alba'' was published in Buenos Aires, rumours of its favourable reception reached him in Mount Holyoke.  He was gratified to learn that he was starting to find an audience and that his name was getting mentioned when Spanish poetry was discussed.<ref name=\"Cernuda655\"/>\n\n==Translations==\n\nDuring the writing of ''Invocaciones'', he met the German philosopher and linguist [[Jean Gebser|Hans Gebser]], who was living and working in Madrid.  This was at a time when Cernuda was beginning to become enthused by the poetry of [[H\u00f6lderlin]] and, with his help he began to translate selected poems.  These appeared in ''Cruz y Raya'' in early 1936.<ref name=\"Cernuda641\"/>  Because his knowledge of German was rudimentary, he made an error in translating the final line of one of the poems.  A second edition was published in Mexico in 1942 but, since Bergam\u00edn did not advise him of this and Cernuda himself was living in Scotland at the time, he was unable to correct this and other infelicities.\n\nDuring his time in London, probably 1946, he began to translate Shakespeare's [[Troilus and Cressida]] into Spanish.  This was a task that taught him a lot and which gave him a great deal of satisfaction.<ref name=\"Cernuda652\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 652</ref>\n\n==Prose poetry and criticism==\n\nCernuda produced two collections of prose poetry.  ''Ocnos'' was originally published in 1942 in London.  Subsequent augmented editions were published in Madrid in 1949 and Xalapa in 1963.  ''Variaciones sobre tema mexicano'' was published in 1952.\n\nHe published critical articles all through his career however he also produced 4 major works of criticism:\n* ''Estudios sobre poes\u00eda espa\u00f1ola contempor\u00e1nea'' (Madrid 1957) in a heavily bowdlerised version that omitted the chapters relating to living figures such as Guill\u00e9n, Aleixandre, Altolaguirre, Diego and Alberti.\n* ''Pensamiento po\u00e9tico en la l\u00edrica inglesa'' (Mexico 1958)\n* ''Poes\u00eda y literatura, I y II'' (Barcelona 1960, 1964)\n\n==Cernuda and his contemporaries==\n\n===Salinas and Guill\u00e9n===\n\nHe came to the attention of Pedro Salinas in his first year at Seville University - 1920-21 - and recorded, as late as 1958, that he would probably never have found his vocation as a poet had it not been for the older man's encouragement.<ref name=\"Cernuda627\"/>  However, his attitude towards Salinas seems to have been quite complex, as far as can be judged from his writings.  In 1929 and 1930, his growing political militancy, inspired by his attraction to surrealism, made it difficult for him to tolerate friends whom he had come to consider bourgeois - such as Guill\u00e9n, Salinas and even Aleixandre.<ref name=\"Cernuda637\"/>  Even though he might have reverted to friendly terms with Salinas and Guill\u00e9n (it seems unlikely that he would have shunned Aleixandre), in a collection of essays published in 1957, ''Estudios sobre Poes\u00eda espa\u00f1ola contempor\u00e1nea'', it is possible to see that he continues to view them as adhering to a different conception of poetry.  For Cernuda, a true poet has to break away from society in some way, even if he might live a lifestyle that looks totally conventional from the outside, and these two poets never managed to do that.<ref name=\"Cernuda196\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Salinas y Guill\u00e9n p 196</ref>  He does not approve of the playful qualities in Salinas's poetry and his seeming refusal to deal with profound subjects.<ref name=\"Cernuda197\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Salinas y Guill\u00e9n p 197</ref>  When he considers the change that came over Salinas's poetry with ''La voz a ti debida'', he dismisses it as\n\n<blockquote>just another game, a desire to show that he was as human as the next man.<ref name=\"Cernuda199\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Salinas y Guill\u00e9n p 199</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn truth, the poetry of Salinas was alien to Cernuda - so alien as to be antipathetic to him.  His personal relationship with Salinas had probably never fully recovered from the blow of his apparent rejection of ''Perfil del aire'' in 1927.  Not even his favourable review of the first edition of ''La realidad y el deseo'' seems to have appeased Cernuda for long.  Salinas wrote an introduction to an anthology of Spanish poetry that was published in the 1940s and referred to Cernuda as ''el m\u00e1s Licenciado Vidriera de los poetas'', an allusion to a famous short story by [[Cervantes]] in which the hero retreats timorously from life under the delusion that he is made of glass.<ref name=\"Licenciado Vidriera\">[[El licenciado Vidriera]]</ref>   In a poem called \"Malentendu\", included in ''Desolaci\u00f3n de la Quimera'', Cernuda launches a bitter attack on a man who, he claims, consistently misunderstood and ill-treated him, alluding specifically to that description.\n\nHis contacts with Guill\u00e9n seem to have been more sporadic.  Cernuda clearly valued his supportive words when ''Perfil del aire'' first appeared and he does not seem to have done anything to vex Cernuda.  However the latter's assessment is based solely on the evidence of ''C\u00e1ntico'' - the later collections had not begun to appear when Cernuda wrote about him.  Clearly, the poet who wrote in \"Beato sill\u00f3n\" that\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nEl mundo est\u00e1 bien\nHecho\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nhas a different view of reality than Cernuda.  Nevertheless, Cernuda respects his dedication to his poetry and his commitment to revising it and making it better.  However, he does regret that Guill\u00e9n should have expended so much care and energy on expounding such a limited view of life.<ref name=\"Cernuda203\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Salinas y Guill\u00e9n p 203</ref>  He notes what he views as Guill\u00e9n's tendency to draw everything he sees into a contained, bourgeois viewpoint.<ref name=\"Cernuda202\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Salinas y Guill\u00e9n p 202</ref>  He also notes the way that when Guill\u00e9n writes about Lorca, the latter's life and works become a personal affair of the Guill\u00e9n family.  His assessment ends in a contradictory way.  He views Guiill\u00e9n as a poet in the manner of [[Coventry Patmore]] - a now forgotten 19thc. British poet - and yet also one of the 3 or 4 finest poets of his generation.<ref name=\"Cernuda205\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Salinas y Guill\u00e9n p 205</ref>\n\n===Aleixandre===\n\nOne of the first things that Cernuda did on arriving in Madrid in 1928 was to pay a visit to Vicente Aleixandre.<ref name=Cernuda633 />  This was their first meeting.  However, they did not immediately become friends and Cernuda blames it on his own timidity and distrust.<ref name=\"Cernuda2201\">Cernuda: OCP vol 2 Vicente Aleixandre (1950) p 201</ref>  He was struck by Aleixandre's warmth and friendliness, not realising until a later date that his visit had been during the hours when Aleixandre, for the sake of his health, would normally have been resting. Unfortunately he was also struck by Aleixandre's calmness and the sense of ease that he exuded at being in familiar surroundings.  For Cernuda, who was always uneasy about feeling at home anywhere, this was a reason for deciding that he did not want to see Aleixandre again.<ref name=\"Cernuda2202\">Cernuda: OCP vol 2 Vicente Aleixandre (1950) p 202</ref>\n\nAfter his return to Madrid from Toulouse in June 1929, he met Aleixandre again: he recounts that it was Aleixandre who re-introduced himself to Cernuda as he himself did not recognise him.  Gradually, over the course of many meetings, Cernuda's habitual reserve and distrust faded.  His friendship with Vicente Aleixandre developed into the closest he had ever had.  They often met in Aleixandre's house, sometimes with Lorca and Altolaguirre there as well.  Aleixandre seems to have had a special gift for friendship, because he also became one of Lorca's closest friends (according to Ian Gibson).<ref name=Gibson199>Gibson p 199</ref> and Cernuda notes specifically his skill as an attentive and sympathetic listener.  The implication is that he was trusted with the intimate confessions of many of his friends.<ref name=\"Cernuda2204\">Cernuda: OCP vol 2 Vicente Aleixandre (1950) p 204</ref> Cernuda also gives a very favourable account of Aleixandre's poetry in ''Estudios sobre poes\u00eda espa\u00f1ola contempor\u00e1nea'', seeing in his work the struggle of a man of intense feeling trapped inside a sick body,<ref name=\"Cernuda228\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Vicente Aleixandre p 228</ref> an analogous situation to his own struggle for fulfilment.\n\nHowever, not even Aleixandre was able to escape from Cernuda's sensitivity about his future reputation.  In the 1950s, he wrote a few essays on his memories of Cernuda, which of course were fixed in the late 1920s and early 1930s.  He describes his friend's apparent detachment from the world and unwillingness to engage.  No attempt was made to see whether that old image still fitted the man who had gone through all the upheaval that Cernuda had experienced while going into exile.  Perhaps more importantly, there was no attempt made to dissociate the poetry written by Cernuda, from Cernuda the man as Aleixandre had known him 20 years earlier.<ref name=\"Harris A Study12\">Harris A Study of the Poetry p12</ref>\n\n===Lorca===\n\nCernuda's relationship with Lorca was one of the most important in his life, notwithstanding the fact of its brevity. He first met Lorca in Seville in December 1927, during the celebrations in honour of G\u00f3ngora.  He recalled this meeting in an article he wrote in 1938.<ref name=Cernuda2148>Cernuda OCP vol 2 Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca (1938) p148-154</ref>  They met on the patio of a hotel in the evening.  Cernuda was struck by the contrast between Lorca's large, eloquent, melancholy eyes and his thickset peasant's body. He was not favourably impressed by his theatrical manner and by the way he was surrounded by hangers-on - reminiscent of a matador.  However, something drew them together: ''Something that I hardly understood or did not wish to acknowledge began to unite us....he took me by the arm and we left the others.''\n\nHe next met Lorca three years later in Aleixandre's apartment in Madrid<ref name=\"Cernuda637\"/> after Lorca's return from New York and Cuba.  He noticed that something in Lorca had changed; he was less precious, less melancholy and more sensual.<ref name=Cernuda2148 />\n\nConsidering the friendship between them and his admiration for Lorca, Cernuda is dispassionate in his assessments of Lorca's poetry.  He is not a whole-hearted admirer of the ''Romancero gitano'', for example, unimpressed by the obscurity of the narratives in many of the individual poems and by the theatricality and outmoded [[costumbrismo]] of the collection as a whole.<ref name=\"Cernuda210\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca p 210</ref>  When he discusses ''Canciones'', he deplores the jokiness of some of the poems -\n\n<blockquote>an attitude unworthy of a poet, but more appropriate to the son of a wealthy family who, comfortable in his very bourgeois status, is able to mock it, because he knows that it will not cost him anything and that it will earn him the reputation of being a smart, witty chap.</blockquote>\n\nHe notes that this is a fleeting characteristic in Lorca but more persistent in someone such as Alberti.<ref name=\"Cernuda211\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca p 210-211</ref>  For Cernuda, poetry is a serious business and he tends not to approve of people who take it lightly.  It also tends to show how his criticism is guided by his own principles.  He tends to be more lenient in his judgments of poets who are like him.  He seems to approve of the fact that after the success of the ''Romancero gitano'', Lorca continued along his own track, not seduced into writing more gypsy ballads.<ref name=\"Cernuda211_2\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca p 211</ref>  In ''Poeta en Nueva York'', a collection not published in Spain in Lorca's lifetime, Cernuda identifies the heart of the collection as the \"Oda a Walt Whitman\".  This is interesting as it is a poem in which Lorca clearly shows his identification with homosexuals<ref name=Gibson297>Gibson p 297</ref> but Cernuda's reference is rather obscure -\n\n<blockquote>in it the poet gives voice to a feeling that was the very reason of his existence and work.  Because of that it is a pity that this poem is so confused, in spite of its expressive force.<ref name=\"Cernuda212\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca p 212</ref></blockquote>\n \nOn March 8, 1933, he was present at the premiere in Madrid of Garc\u00eda Lorca's play ''Bodas de sangre''.<ref name=Gibson348>Gibson p348</ref> but he makes no reference to it, or indeed to any of Lorca's plays in his writings.  He notes at the end of the chapter on Lorca in ''Estudios sobre Poes\u00eda espa\u00f1ola contempor\u00e1nea'' that Lorca's later poems give clear signs to suggest that he had a lot more to say at the time of his death and that his style was developing in emotional force.<ref name=\"Cernuda214\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca p 214</ref>\n\nCernuda wrote an elegy for Lorca which he included in ''Las nubes'' and to the end of his life took pains to try to ensure that the image of Lorca was not academicised, that he remained a figure of vitality, rebellion and nonconformism.<ref name=\"Villena introduction50\" />\n\n===D\u00e1maso Alonso===\n\nIn 1948, Cernuda published an open letter to the famous critic D\u00e1maso Alonso in reaction to an article by the latter titled ''Una generaci\u00f3n po\u00e9tica (1920-36)''.<ref name=Cernuda2198>Cernuda OCP vol 2 Carta abierta a D\u00e1maso Alonso p 198-200</ref>   He takes exception to 2 passages:\n#Cernuda, at that time very young\n#Cernuda was still a boy, almost isolated in Seville, in the year of our excursion to Seville, the same year in which ''Perfil del aire'' appeared in M\u00e1laga, which neither represents his mature work....\n\nHe points out that he was 25 at this time, so can scarcely be considered \"very young\" or a \"boy\".  As for his isolation in Seville, Alonso should recall that he had already had poems published in the ''Revista de Occidente'' and elsewhere.  However, it is noteworthy that in his later essay, ''Historial de un libro'', he used the same expression to depict his sense of confusion at the hostile reviews to his first collection.<ref name=Cernuda629 />  He also criticises Alonso's use of the word \"mature\".  He points out the essential inconsistency in saying that the poet was young and then expecting maturity in his early work.  He then states that for him the key factor is not whether a poem is mature or not but whether it has artistic merit.  He goes on to say that, even after the passage of time, he still prefers some of his earlier poems to certain poems written later.\n\nThe major complaint he raises is that this critique is just a lazy repetition of the initial critical reaction in 1927.<ref name=Cernuda2198 />  One of his key beliefs is that there are poets who find their audience at once and poets who have to wait for an audience to come to them - he reiterates this in ''Historial de un libro''.<ref name=Cernuda641 />  He is one of the latter.  So when people like Alonso, who rejected his early work and still persist in calling it immature, now say he is a fine poet, he takes that to mean that they are merely picking up on the favourable reactions of people 20 years younger to his recent works - in other words, the audience that has found him - and that they are unable to see the continuities between the earlier and the later work.\n\nThis develops into a key theme of Cernuda's final collection.  In \"Malentendu\", he shows his unease that his own reputation could be shaped beyond the grave by the perceptions of someone such as Pedro Salinas and his reference to ''El Licenciado Vidriera''.  In \"Otra vez, con sentimiento\", he shows the same unease on behalf of Lorca.  Alonso had written in the same article (''Una generaci\u00f3n po\u00e9tica (1920-36)'') a tribute to Lorca, calling him \"my prince\".  Cernuda is keen to save his old friend from appropriation by reactionary forces, defending his unconventional lifestyle (homosexuality) and everything else about him that would prevent him from being free to live in Franco's Spain.<ref name=\"Villena introduction50\">Villena intro to Las Nubes etc p 50</ref>\n\n===Alberti and political commitment===\n\nAlberti was another of the people whom he met for the first time in the G\u00f3ngora celebrations in Seville in 1927.  Alberti describes him as ''dark, thin, extremely refined and meticulous''.<ref name=Alberti239>Alberti p. 239</ref>  However, it is not likely that Alberti ever became close to Cernuda although the latter contributed to many of the former's journals during the early 1930s.  Alberti invited him to contribute to the celebratory album that he was editing<ref name=Alberti242>Alberti p. 242</ref> but Cernuda did not follow it up.  His relationship with Alberti is suggestive of the pathways along which his mind was moving after his initial contact with surrealism.  In 1933, for example, he wrote for Alberti's magazine ''Octubre'' a piece called ''Los que se incorporan (Those who join up)''.  In it he calls for the destruction of bourgeois society:  ''I trust in a revolution inspired by communism to achieve this''.<ref name=Cernuda2_63>Cernuda OCP vol 2 Los que se incorporan p 63</ref>\n\nIn an article written for ''Hora de Espa\u00f1a'' in 1937, he wrote that: ''the poet is inevitably a revolutionary... a revolutionary with full awareness of his responsibility''.<ref name=Cernuda2121>Cernuda OCP vol 2 L\u00edneas sobre los poetas y para los poetas en los d\u00edas actuales p 121</ref>  However, by that time, it seems clear that he did not expect poets to get directly involved in revolutionary actions.  In an essay devoted to Aleixandre in 1950 he goes so far as to say that, for a poet to take the course of direct action ''is absurd and tends to ruin the poet as a poet''.<ref name=\"Cernuda2207\">Cernuda: OCP vol 2 Vicente Aleixandre (1950) p 207</ref>\n\nThis attitude seems to colour his response to Alberti's poetic output but it is noticeable that he does try to differentiate between the man and the poet.  It is clear that he was always in favour of Alberti's efforts on behalf of exploited Spaniards.  The problem is that Alberti stepped over Cernuda's line where poetry becomes activism.  A key point in Cernuda's view of Alberti's poetry is that Alberti seemed to lack any sense of self.<ref name=\"Cernuda220\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Rafael Alberti p 220</ref>  He also highlights the fact that Alberti was a virtuoso versifier, able to counterfeit the manner of Gil Vicente or any other folk poet.  Cernuda does not approve of the playfulness that Alberti shows in his first three collections.<ref name=Cernuda220 /> He does not believe that Alberti rises above the level of his models, such as G\u00f3ngora and Guill\u00e9n in ''Cal y canto'' - in other words he sees Alberti as a parodist rather than as an original poet.<ref name=\"Cernuda221\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Rafael Alberti p 221</ref>  There is a sense in which he envies the fact that Alberti became so successful so rapidly, using him as an example of a poet who found his public immediately.<ref name=Cernuda221 /> And yet, he ends up by praising his poetic fluency while stating that he had nothing to say and that his work is basically deprived of passion and emotion.  Cernuda wonders whether Alberti's recognition of the social injustice of Spain was the inspiration for him to write political poetry or whether his assumption of Communist beliefs forced him to reject personal values.<ref name=\"Cernuda223\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Rafael Alberti p 223</ref>\n\n===Altolaguirre and his family===\n\nThat there was a close bond between Altolaguirre, his wife Concha M\u00e9ndez, and Cernuda seems clear.  Cernuda devoted separate chapters in both ''Estudios sobre poes\u00eda espa\u00f1ola contempor\u00e1nea'' and ''Poes\u00eda y literatura'' to the poetry of Altolaguirre, consistently asserting that he was not a minor poet, despite the critical consensus to that effect.  In ''Desolaci\u00f3n de la Quimera'', he defends his dead friend from superficial, mistaken memories of \"Manolito\" the endearing man, held by people who have forgotten or never knew his rare gifts as a poet, in \"Supervivencias tribales en el medio literario\".<ref name=\"Villena introduction50\" />   It is like an echo of his fears for what will happen to his own reputation after death - will people remember him or turn to the legends promulgated by people like Salinas.\n\nWhen Altolaguirre and Concha married in June 1932, Cernuda was one of the witnesses at their wedding, along with Lorca, Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez, and Guill\u00e9n.<ref name=Islasintro14>Altolaguirre intro to Las Islas invitadas p 14</ref>  When in March 1933 their first child died in childbirth, Cernuda dedicated a poem to him - \"XIV\" in ''Donde habite el olvido''.<ref name=Islasintro15>Altolaguirre intro to Las Islas invitadas p 15</ref>  They lived in the same building in Madrid from 1935 to 1936 and, in Mexico, he lived in Concha's house.  At times, it seems that this was his real family.  In ''Desolaci\u00f3n de la Quimera'', there are two poems that suggest this.  \"Animula, vagula, blandula\" is a tender poem about watching Altolaguirre's five-year-old grandson, whom he nicknamed [[Entelechy]], playing in the garden and wondering how his fate will differ from his own.  \"Hablando a Manona\" is like a nursery rhyme addressed to their granddaughter.<ref name=\"Villena200\">Villena notes to Desolaci\u00f3n de la quimera p 200</ref>\n\n===Generation of 1898===\n\nCernuda's best critical writing tends to be about writers who interested and inspired him.  His writing about the Generation of 1898 is objective but nevertheless lacking in sympathy for the most part.  For example, he regards Valle-Incl\u00e1n as a playwright rather than the novelist, poet and general literary artist that history remembers him as.<ref name=Cernuda2191>Cernuda OCP vol 2 Teatro espa\u00f1ol contempor\u00e1neo p 191</ref>  Cernuda does not seem to have very much respect for the great figures of this generation, unlike most of his own generation.  Regarding Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez and Valle-Incl\u00e1n, he recalled that they were so intent on their own speech that they neglected to listen to other people.  And even in respect of Antonio Machado, so revered by for example Alberti,<ref name=Alberti216>Alberti p 216</ref>  he recalled that he spoke little and listened to even less.<ref name=Cernuda2156>Cernuda OCP vol 2 Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez 1941 p 156</ref>  In contrast to most Spanish thinkers, he respected [[Unamuno]] more as a poet than as a philosopher.<ref name=Cernuda128>Cernuda OCP vol 1 Miguel de Unamuno p 128</ref>  For Ortega y Gasset, he had little positive to say:  scattered all through Cernuda's critical writings are remarks such as ''[he] always understood very little when it came to poetry''<ref name=Cernuda126>Cernuda OCP vol 1 Miguel de Unamuno p 126</ref> and ''with his strange ignorance of poetic matters''.<ref name=Cernuda175>Cernuda OCP vol 1 G\u00f3mez de la Serna p 175</ref>  The member of that generation who had most impact on him is Jim\u00e9nez, although when he went to Britain one of the very few books that he took with him was [[Gerardo Diego]]'s anthology ''Poes\u00eda espa\u00f1ola'' and he found solace for his nostalgia for Spain in reading the selection of poems by Unamuno and Machado contained within.<ref name=\"Cernuda645\"/>  It is also true that in his study of Unamuno, he makes a comment that seems to relate directly to his own practice as a writer, his preoccupation with creating and perpetuating himself in his poetry, transforming the circumstances of his life into myth:<ref name=\"Poesia completa48\">Derek Harris: Introduction to Poes\u00eda completa p 48</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Alive and striving beyond what was only current circumstances, moments that pass and do not remain, Unamuno was hoping to create himself, or at least create his personal myth, and to be forever what was passing.<ref name=Cernuda129>Cernuda OCP vol 1 Miguel de Unamuno p 129</ref></blockquote>\n\nHe first met Jim\u00e9nez in late September-early October 1925 in Seville.  The meeting had been arranged by Pedro Salinas and he suggested to Cernuda that he should ask one of his friends, whose father was a warden of the Alc\u00e1zar, for permission to visit the gardens, out of hours.<ref name=Cernuda733>Cernuda OCP vol 1 PyL II Los Dos Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez p 733</ref>  Cernuda's account is interesting.  He was overawed by being in the presence of such an important figure.  In addition, there was the presence of Jim\u00e9nez's wife - [[Zenobia Camprub\u00ed]] - which also put him at a disadvantage, both because of his shyness and a lack of interest in women, although he had not yet realised why women did not interest him.<ref name=Cernuda734>Cernuda OCP vol 1 PyL II Los Dos Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez p 734</ref>  He placed himself in the role of a disciple, just listening to the Master.  He records how gracious Jim\u00e9nez was to him that evening and on subsequent meetings.  At that time, he was something of a hero to Cernuda and he notes how much effort it cost him to free himself from Jim\u00e9nez's type of personal, subjective poetry with no connection to the world and life, so influential as it was in Spanish cultural circles at that time.<ref name=Cernuda734/>\n\nIn this essay, he analyses the Jekyll and Hyde personality of Jim\u00e9nez.  On the one hand he was a famous poet, worthy of admiration and respect.  On the other hand, he was the man who launched abusive attacks on numerous literary figures.  This latter side gradually became more and more dominant.<ref name=Cernuda731>Cernuda OCP vol 1 PyL II Los Dos Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez p 731</ref>  In particular he took against the poets of Cernuda's own generation, at first confining his attacks to verbal ones but then turning to print.  He continued to print vilifications right to the end of his life, which had the effect of turning Cernuda's former admiration into indifference or even worse.<ref name=Cernuda733/>\n\nCernuda wrote many pieces about Jim\u00e9nez, including 2 satirical poems included in ''Desolaci\u00f3n de la Quimera''.  The early influence was decisively rejected and his essays identify all the stylistic elements that he cast off, such as the impressionistic symbolism,<ref name=\"Harris A Study5\">Harris A Study of the Poetry p5</ref> hermeticism,<ref name=Cernuda149>Cernuda OCP vol 1 Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez p 149</ref> the fragmentation of his poems,<ref name=Cernuda147>Cernuda OCP vol 1 Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez p 147</ref> his inability to sustain a thought,<ref name=Cernuda149/> the lack of desire to go beyond the surface of things.<ref name=Cernuda143>Cernuda OCP vol 1 Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez p 143</ref>\n\n==Gide, the dandy and homosexuality==\n\nHis sexual awakening seems to have coincided with the birth of his desire to write poetry, around the age of 14,<ref name=\"Cernuda626\"/> but it was many years later before he really came to terms with this side of himself.  A very important influence on his emotional development was the writings of Andr\u00e9 Gide.  In his essay of 1946, he writes: \"the transcendent figure for Gide is not that of a man who by means of abstention and denial searches for the divine, but that of a man who seeks out the fullness of humanity by means of effort and individual exaltation.\"<ref name=Cernuda549>Cernuda OCP vol 1 PyL I Andr\u00e9 Gide p 549</ref> In other words, he was affected by the idea of total [[hedonism]] without any sense of guilt.<ref name=\"Poesia completa52\">Harris intro to Poes\u00eda completa p 52</ref>\n\nAs seen in his accounts of his first meetings with Jim\u00e9nez in 1925 and Lorca in 1927, he had not really come to terms with his sexuality.  This only seems to happen once he finally left Seville in 1928, after his mother's death. He had already become noted as something of a dandy during his time at the University of Seville, as noted by Salinas - \"a well-cut suit, a perfectly-knotted tie\".<ref name=\"Villena introduction12\">Villena intro to edition of Las Nubes p 12</ref> This tendency seems to have intensified during his brief stay in Madrid before going to Toulouse - the pose of a man who frequents bars, drinks cocktails, affects English shirts, discussed in an article by Villena (''La rebeld\u00eda del dandy en Luis Cernuda'').<ref name=\"Villena introduction16\">Villena intro to edition of Las Nubes p 16</ref>  Villena diagnoses it as the sign of a refined hermit trying to hide his hyper-sensitivity and repressed desire for love. In Toulouse, he wrote to a friend that he was starting to think that he was too well-dressed.<ref name=\"Villena introduction17\">Villena intro to edition of Las Nubes p 17</ref>  Alone, in a foreign country, and still not at ease in his skin, he was taking refuge in dazzling the provincial bourgeoisie - thumbing his nose at them by wearing an immaculate three-piece suit.<ref name=\"Villena introduction17\"/> In some way, however, the combination of his contact with the world, the attitudes and thinking of the surrealists, the influence of Gide, and his pent-up fight against bourgeois tendencies coincided in the belated acceptance of his sexuality, as expressed finally in ''Un r\u00edo, un amor''.<ref name=\"Poesia completa53\">Harris intro to Poes\u00eda completa p 53</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n\nCernuda's work was known to the poets who grew up in Spain after the Civil War.  Of these, clear signs of influence can be seen in [[Jaime Gil de Biedma]], Jos\u00e9 Valente and Francisco Brines.<ref name=\"Villena introduction56\">Villena intro to Las Nubes etc p 56</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book|last=Harris|first=Derek|title=Luis Cernuda: A study of the Poetry|year=1973|publisher=Tamesis Books Ltd|location=London|isbn=0-900411-70-8|page=188}}\n*{{cite book|last=Alberti|first=Rafael|title=The Lost Grove (trans Gabriel Berns)|year=1976|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles|isbn=0-520-02786-8|page=323}}\n*{{cite book|last=Connell|first=Geoffrey|title=Spanish Poetry of the Grupo poetico de 1927|year=1977|publisher=Pergamon Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-08-016950-3|page=214}}\n*{{cite book|last=Morris|first=C|title=A Generation of Spanish Poets|isbn=0521294819|date=February 22, 1979|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/generationofspan0000morr_i3c2}}\n*{{cite book|last=Gibson|first=Ian|title=Federico Garcia Lorca|year=1989|publisher=Faber and Faber|location=London|isbn=0-571-14224-9|page=551}}\n*{{cite book|last=Guillen|first=Jorge|title=Language and Poetry|year=1961|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.| id =60-15889|page=293}}(Library of Congress Catalog Card Number)\n*{{cite book|last=P\u00e9rez Firmat|first=Gustavo|title=Tongue Ties: Logo-Eroticism in Anglo-Hispanic Literature|year=2003|publisher=Palgrave}}\n*{{cite book|last=Cernuda|first=Luis|title=Obra completa Prosa 2 vols|year=1994|publisher=Ediciones Siruela|location=Madrid|editor=Derek Harris and Luis Maristany}}\n*{{cite book|editor = Luis Antonio de Villena|last=Cernuda|first=Luis|title=Las Nubes; Desolacion de la Quimera|year=1984|publisher=Ediciones Catedra|location=Madrid|isbn=84-376-0480-X|page=213}}\n*{{cite book|last=Cernuda|first=Luis|title=Un rio, un amor and Los placeres prohibidos|year=1999|publisher=Ediciones Catedra|location=Madrid|isbn=84-376-1750-2|page=173|editor=Derek Harris}}\n*{{cite web|last=Valender|first=James|title=Stanley Richardson and Spain|url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/spanish/idealist/pages/page954.shtml|publisher=Revista Canaria de Estudios Ingleses (Tenerife), 7, pp. 61-72.|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130419152034/http://www.abdn.ac.uk/spanish/idealist/pages/page954.shtml|archivedate=April 19, 2013}}\n*{{cite journal|last=Murphy|first=Martin|title=Pub Poets|journal=Times Literary Supplement |date=April 26, 2013|page=14}}\n*{{cite book|last=Cernuda|first=Luis|title=Poesia completa|year=1993|publisher=Ediciones Siruela|location=Madrid|page=863|editor=Derek Harris and Luis Maristany}}\n*{{cite book|last=Cernuda|first=Luis|title=Selected Poems of Luis Cernuda (Bilingual Edition)|year=1999|publisher=The Sheep Meadow Press|location=Riverdale-on-Hudson|isbn=1-878818-80-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/selectedpoemsofl00cern/page/185 185]|editor=Reginald Gibbons|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/selectedpoemsofl00cern/page/185}}\n*{{cite book|last=Altolaguirre|first=Manuel|title=Las Islas invitadas|year=1972|publisher=Editorial Castalia|location=Madrid|isbn=84-7039-160-7|page=162|editor=Margarita Smerdou Altolaguirre}}\n*{{cite book|title=Studies in Modern Spanish Literature and Art presented to Helen F.

During the Spanish Civil War, in early 1938, he went to the UK to deliver some lectures and this became the start of an exile that lasted till the end of his life.  He taught in the universities of Glasgow and Cambridge before moving in 1947 to the US.  In the 1950s he moved to Mexico.  While he continued to write poetry, he also published wide-ranging books of [[literary criticism|critical essays]], covering French, English and German as well as Spanish literature. He was frank about his [[homosexuality]] at a time when this was problematic and became something of a role model for this in Spain.  His collected poems were published under the title ''[[La realidad y el deseo]]''.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Seville and early life===\n\nCernuda was born in the Barrio Santa Cruz, Calle Conde de T\u00f3jar 6 (now Acetres),<ref name=\"Villena introduction11\">Villena intro to edition of Las Nubes p 11</ref> in Seville in 1902, the son of a colonel in the Regiment of Engineers.<ref name=\"Poesia completa\">Poes\u00eda completa: Cronolog\u00eda biogr\u00e1fica</ref>  He had two older sisters. The recollections and impressions of childhood contained in his poems, and the prose poems collected in ''Ocnos'', suggest that he was always a solitary, introverted, and timid child whose unhappiness in the family led to his living vicariously through books and through his strong visual impressions of his native city.<ref name=\"Connell201\">Connell p 201</ref>  His first encounter with poetry came at the age of 9 when he glanced through a copy of [[B\u00e9cquer]]'s ''Rimas'' that had been lent to his sisters by their cousins Luisa and Br\u00edgida de la Sota.<ref name=\"Cernuda625\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 625</ref>  Despite the fact that he later testified that this left no more than a dormant impression upon him, he began to write poetry himself during his studies at the Escolapios School in Seville from 1915 to 1919 around the age of 14.<ref name=\"hispanicexile.bham.ac.uk\">hispanicexile.bham.ac.uk/people/51</ref>  In 1914, the family moved into the Engineers' Barracks in the Prado, on the outskirts of Seville.  In 1918, they moved to Calle del Aire, where he would later write the poems of ''Perfil del aire''. \n[[Image:Casa natal de Luis Cernuda.jpg|thumb|Birthplace of Luis Cernuda in Seville]]\nIn 1919 he began to study Law at the [[University of Seville]], where, during his first year, he attended classes In Spanish Language and Literature given by [[Pedro Salinas]].  His extreme shyness prevented him from mentioning his literary activities until Salinas' notice was caught by a prose poem published in a student magazine.  He gave Cernuda encouragement and urged him to read both classical Spanish poetry and modern French literature.<ref name=\"Cernuda627\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 627</ref>  It was at Salinas' suggestion that Cernuda sent his first collection of poetry, ''Perfil del aire'', to [[Manuel Altolaguirre|Altolaguirre]] and [[Emilio Prados]], who had begun, late in 1926, to publish a magazine called ''[[Litoral]]''.  As was the practice in those days, many such magazines published collections of poetry as supplements.\n\nHis father died in 1920 and he continued to live at home with his mother and sisters.  In 1923 he did military service in the Regiment of Cavalry.<ref name=\"Poesia completa\" />  In 1924, as he was reaching the end of his undergraduate course, he participated in a series of meetings with a small group of fellow students in Salinas's house.  These stimulated his poetic vocation and helped to guide his readings of French literature.<ref name=\"Poesia completa\" />\n\nHe became a Bachelor of Law in September 1925 but was undecided about what to do next.  He thought about joining the diplomatic service but decided not to on discovering that it would entail a move to Madrid.<ref name=\"Poesia completa\" />   In October, Salinas arranged for him to make the acquaintance of [[Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez]] in the gardens of the [[Alc\u00e1zar of Seville]].<ref name=\"Poesia completa\" />\n\nIn January 1926, he made his first trip to Madrid, where Salinas was instrumental in arranging introductions to, among others, [[Ortega y Gasset]] - who had published some of his poems in his ''Revista de Occidente'' in December 1925 - [[Juan Chab\u00e1s]], [[Melchor Fern\u00e1ndez Almagro]], and [[Enrique D\u00edez-Canedo]];<ref name=\"hispanicexile.bham.ac.uk\"/> At the time his first book was being unfavourably received around April 1927, he was again in Madrid, at least for a while.<ref name=\"Poesia completa\" />  Although he later described himself at that time as ''inexperto, aislado en Sevilla'',<ref name=Cernuda629 /> he was in reality already known to a number of the influential Spanish literati of the period.  His indecision about a choice of career continued through 1926-27.  In December 1927, the [[Luis de G\u00f3ngora#G\u00f3ngora and the Generation of '27|G\u00f3ngora tercentenary celebrations]] reached a climax with a series of poetry readings and lectures at the [[Ateneo de Sevilla|Arts Club of Seville]] by people such as [[Garc\u00eda Lorca]], [[D\u00e1maso Alonso]], [[Rafael Alberti]], [[Jorge Guill\u00e9n]], [[Jos\u00e9 Bergam\u00edn]] and others.  Although he took no direct part in the proceedings, he did get the chance to read some of his poems and he made the acquaintance of Lorca.<ref name=\"Gibson200\">Gibson p 200</ref>\n\n===Madrid and France===\n\nHis mother died in July 1928 and, at the start of September, Cernuda left Seville.<ref name=\"Cernuda632\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 632</ref>  He spent a few days in M\u00e1laga with Altolaguirre, Prados and [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Hinojosa]] before moving to Madrid.  Although he had a law degree, he had no intention of making practical use of it.  He was starting to realise that poetry was the only thing that really mattered to him.<ref name=\"Cernuda633\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 633</ref>  He renewed acquaintance with Salinas and met [[Vicente Aleixandre]].  Salinas arranged for him to become the Spanish ''lector'' at the [[University of Toulouse]].  He took up post in November and stayed there for an academic year.<ref name=\"Poesia completa\" />  The experience of living on his own in a foreign city led him to a crucial realisation about himself:  his almost crippling shyness, his unhappiness in a family setting, his sense of isolation from the rest of humanity, had all been symptoms of a latent homosexuality which now manifested itself and which he accepted, in a spirit of defiance.<ref name=Connell202 />   This led to a decisive change in the type of poetry he wrote.  He also discovered a love of jazz and films, which seems to have activated an interest in the USA.<ref name=\"Cernuda636\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 636</ref>\n\nBetween his return from Toulouse in June 1929 to 1936, Cernuda lived in Madrid and participated actively in the literary and cultural scene of the Spanish capital.  At the start of 1930, he found a job in a bookshop owned by [[Le\u00f3n S\u00e1nchez Cuesta]].  All through this period, he worked with many organisations attempting to create a more liberal and tolerant Spain.  For example, between 1932 and 1935, he participated in the ''Misiones Pedag\u00f3gicas'' - a cultural outreach organisation set up by the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]].<ref name=\"Poesia completa\" />  He also contributed articles to radical journals such as ''Octubre'', edited by Alberti and his wife [[Mar\u00eda Teresa Le\u00f3n]], which could suggest at least a temporary adhesion to the Communist Party.<ref name=\"Gibbons intro 10\">Gibbons intro p 10</ref>   In June 1935, he took lodgings in Calle Viriato, Madrid, above the flat of Altolaguirre and his wife [[Concha M\u00e9ndez]].<ref name=\"Poesia completa\" />\n\nIn February 1936, he participated with Lorca and Alberti in an hommage to the Galician writer [[Valle-Incl\u00e1n]].<ref name=\"Poesia completa\" />   Since ''Perfil del aire'', he had only managed to publish one collection - ''Donde habite el olvido'' - in 1934, and a few individual poems.  This difficulty in getting published gave Cernuda the chance to revise and reflect on his work.  It also occurred to him in the meantime that he could bring all his poetry together under the title ''La realidad y el deseo''.<ref name=Cernuda641>Cernuda OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 641</ref>   In April 1936, [[Jos\u00e9 Bergam\u00edn]] published the book in his journal ''Cruz y Raya''.  Subsequent editions added new poems as separate books under this collective title.  On April 21, there was a celebratory dinner, attended by Lorca, Salinas, [[Pablo Neruda]], Altolaguirre, Alberti, Aleixandre and Bergam\u00edn himself.<ref name=Gibson432>Gibson p 432</ref>\n\n===Spanish Civil War===\n\nWhen the [[Spanish Civil War]] broke out, a friend of his, [[Concha de Albornoz]], arranged for him to join her in Paris as secretary to her father, the ambassador [[Alvaro de Albornoz]].  He remained there from July to September 1936, but after that he returned to Madrid along with the ambassador and his family.<ref name=\"Cernuda642\"/>\n\nFor perhaps the only time in his life Cernuda felt the desire to be useful, which he achieved by serving on the Republican side.<ref name=\"Cernuda642\">Cernuda: OCP Historial de un libro vol 1 p 642</ref>  He was hopeful that there was a possibility of righting some of the social injustices that he saw in Spanish society.  From October 1936 to April 1937, he participated in radio broadcasts with A. Serrano Plaja in the [[Sierra de Guadarrama]], north of Madrid.  In April 1937, he moved to Valencia and began to write poems that would be collected in ''Las Nubes''.  He also came into contact with [[Juan Gil-Albert]] and the other members of the editorial team behind the periodical ''Hora de Espa\u00f1a'' and began to work with them.<ref name=\"Poesia completa\" />   In June, he had trouble with a functionary from the Ministry of Education about a poem on the subject of Lorca - now dead - and had to remove a reference to the subject's homosexuality.<ref name=\"Poesia completa\" />  He played the role of Don Pedro in a performance of Lorca's play ''Mariana Pineda''<ref name=\"Poesia completa\" />  during the Second Congress of [[Anti-fascism|Anti-Fascist]] Intellectuals in [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]] in 1937.<ref name=\"hispanicexile.bham.ac.uk\"/>  At this time, he met [[Octavio Paz]].<ref name=\"Poesia completa\" />  In October, he returned to Madrid, where he remained until February 1938, working on the periodical ''El Mono Azul'', edited by Alberti and Mar\u00eda Teresa Le\u00f3n.\n\n===Exile in Britain===\n\nIn February 1938, an English friend, the poet Stanley Richardson, who died in [[the Blitz]] in 1941,<ref name=\"Stanley Richardson and Spain\">Stanley Richardson and Spain</ref> arranged for him to give a series of lectures in Oxford and Cambridge.  At the time, Cernuda thought that he would be away from Spain for one or two months, however this was to be the start of an exile that would last for the rest of his life.  The lectures never took place.  Richardson was well-connected, however, and arranged a party for him, attended by celebrities such as [[Katharine Stewart-Murray, Duchess of Atholl|the Duchess of Atholl]], [[Gavin Henderson, 2nd Baron Faringdon]], the Chinese ambassador, [[Rebecca West]] and [[Rose Macaulay]].  Even by then, the situation in Spain meant that it was not advisable for Cernuda to return and so Richardson suggested that he should join a colony of evacuated Basque children at [[Eaton Hastings]] on Faringdon's estate.<ref name=\"Murphy: Pub Poets\">Murphy: Pub Poets</ref>\n\nAfter a few months in England, penniless and barely able to speak English, he went to Paris with the intention of returning to Spain.  But he stayed on in Paris on receiving news of what was happening in his native land.<ref name=\"Cernuda644\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 644</ref>   In September 1938 Richardson secured him a position as Spanish assistant in [[Cranleigh School]].<ref name=\"Cernuda645\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 645</ref> In January 1939 he became the ''lector'' at the [[University of Glasgow]].\n\nNeither Glasgow nor Scotland appealed to him, which is perhaps noticeable in the downbeat tone of the poems he wrote there.  From 1941 onward, he spent his summer vacations in Oxford, where, despite the ravages of the war, there were plenty of well-stocked bookshops.  In August 1943, he moved to [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]], where he was much happier.<ref name=\"Cernuda648\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 648</ref>  In Seville he used to attend concerts and music had always been very important to him.  The artistic life of Cambridge and London made it easier for him to develop his musical knowledge. [[Mozart]] was the composer whose music meant the most to him<ref name=\"Cernuda649\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 649</ref> and he devoted a poem to him in his last collection, ''Desolaci\u00f3n de la Quimera''.\n\nIn 1940, while Cernuda was in Glasgow, Bergam\u00edn brought out in Mexico a second edition of ''La realidad y el deseo'', this time including section 7, ''Las nubes''.  A separate edition of this collection appeared in a pirated edition in Buenos Aires in 1943.  He had been afraid that the situation in Spain after the end of the Civil War would create such an unfavourable climate for writers who had gone into exile like him, that his work would be unknown to future generations.  The appearance of these two books was a ray of hope for him.<ref name=\"Cernuda647\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 647</ref>\n\nIn July 1945, he moved to a similar job at the Spanish Institute in London.  He regretted leaving Cambridge, despite the range and variety of theatres, concerts and bookshops in the capital.  He began to take his holidays in Cornwall because he was tired of the big city and urban life.<ref name=\"Cernuda651\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 651</ref>  So, in March 1947, when his old friend [[Concha de Albornoz]], who had been working at [[Mount Holyoke College]], [[Massachusetts]], wrote to offer him a post there, he accepted with alacrity.<ref name=\"Cernuda651\"/>  He managed to secure a passage on a French liner from Southampton to New York, where he arrived on September 10.  He was coming from a country that was impoverished, still showing many signs of war damage and subject to rationing so the shops of New York made it seem as if he were arriving in an earthly paradise.<ref name=\"Cernuda654\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 654</ref>  He also responded favourably to the people and wealth of Mount Holyoke where, ''for the first time in my life, I was going to be paid at a decent and fitting level''.<ref name=\"Cernuda654\"/>\n\n===US and Mexico===\n\nAlthough he was happy in Mount Holyoke, at the end of the 1947-48 year, a student advised him not to stay there and he himself began to wonder whether it was a beneficial force on his poetry.<ref name=\"Cernuda655\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 655</ref>  In the summer of 1949 he paid his first visit to Mexico and was so impressed that Mount Holyoke began to seem irksome.  This can be seen in the collection of prose ''Variaciones sobre tema mexicano'', which he wrote in the winter of 1949-50.<ref name=\"Cernuda655\"/>  He began to spend his summers in Mexico and in 1951, during a 6-month sabbatical, he met X (identified by Cernuda only as Salvador), the inspiration for ''Poemas para un cuerpo'', which he started to write at that time.<ref name=\"Cernuda656\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 656</ref>  This was probably the happiest period of his life.\n\n[[File:UNAM Biblioteca Central.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.75|The Central Library - University of Mexico.]]\nScarcely had he met X than his Mexican visa expired and he returned to the US via Cuba.  It became impossible for him to continue living in Mount Holyoke: the long winter months, the lack of sun, the snow all served to depress him.  On his return from vacation in 1952, he resigned from his post,<ref name=\"hispanicexile.bham.ac.uk\"/> giving up a worthy position, a decent salary, and life in a friendly and welcoming country that offered him a comfortable and convenient lifestyle.  He had always had a restless temperament, a desire to travel to new places.  Only love had the power to overcome this need and make him feel at home in a place, to overcome his sense of isolation.  In this, there is perhaps a clue as to one of the reasons that he was attracted to the surrealists - the belief in the overwhelming power of love.  In addition, he always had a powerful attraction to beautiful young men.<ref name=\"Cernuda659\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 659</ref>  He also had a constant urge to go against the grain of any society in which he found himself.  This helped him not to fall into provincial ways during his youth in Seville, whose inhabitants thought they were living at the centre of the world rather than in a provincial capital.  It also helped to immunise him against the airs and graces of Madrid or any other place in which he lived.<ref name=Cernuda659 />\n\nIn November 1952, he settled in Mexico<ref name=Cernuda660>Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 660</ref>  with his old friends Concha M\u00e9ndez and Altolaguire<ref name=hispanicexile.bham.ac.uk />(although since they had separated in 1944 and later divorced, Cernuda probably stayed with Concha).  Between 1954 and 1960 he was a lecturer at the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]].  In 1958, the third edition of ''La realidad y el deseo'' was published in Mexico. For this edition Cernuda wrote an essay ''Historial de un libro'' which considers his work in order ''to see not so much how I made my poems but rather, as Goethe said, how they made me''.<ref name=Cernuda660 />  In 1958, Altolaguirre died and Cernuda took on the job of editing his poetry.  His two sisters died in 1960.<ref name=\"Poesia completa\" />\n\nIn June 1960, he lectured at [[UCLA]] and became friendly with Carlos Otero, who was presenting a doctoral thesis on Cernuda's poetry that year.  This stay seems to have revitalised Cernuda and, on his return to Mexico, he began to write poetry again.  The poems he wrote in the autumn and winter of 1960-61 form the nucleus of his final collection, ''Desolaci\u00f3n de la Quimera'', which he completed in San Francisco a few months later.  From August 1961 to June 1962, he gave courses at [[San Francisco State College]].  After a brief return to Mexico, he made his third and final visit to California in September 1962, where he was a visiting professor at UCLA until June 1963.  He spent the summer of 1963 in Mexico and, although he had an invitation to lecture at the [[University of Southern California]], he declined it in August, because of the need to undergo a medical in order to extend his visa.  He died in Concha M\u0117ndez's house of a heart attack on November 5, 1963.  He was buried in the [[Pante\u00f3n Jard\u00edn]], Mexico City.<ref name=\"Poesia completa\" />   He never married and had no children.\n\n==Poetry==\n\nLuis Cernuda was one of the most dedicated poets amongst the members of the Generation of 1927.<ref name=Connell202>Connell p 202</ref>   Salinas, Guill\u00e9n, Diego and D\u00e1maso Alonso were as well known for their teaching activities and their critical writings as for their poetry.  Altolaguirre and Prados are probably remembered more for their printing work than for their literary output.  Alberti enjoyed fame for his political activism and Lorca was possibly as gifted in drama and music as he was in poetry.  Cernuda drifted into university teaching simply as a way of earning a living and never held a prestigious post.  Everything in his life was incidental to his work as a poet.  His published criticism is valuable for the insights it gives into his development as a poet - he tends to discuss the authors and works that had most influence on his poetry and thinking.  The development of his poetry from first to last is dictated by the development of his character and not by literary fashion - although his personal crisis, depicted in ''Un r\u00edo, un amor'', does coincide with the personal crises experienced by Alberti, Lorca and Aleixandre.<ref name=Connell202 />  The collective title he chose for his poetry, ''La realidad y el deseo'',  refers to the conflict that is its primary theme. He wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Desire led me towards the reality that offered itself to my eyes as if only through possession of it might I be able to achieve certainty about my own life.  But since I have only ever achieved a precarious grip on it, there comes the opposite tendency, that of hostility to the ironic attractiveness of reality...And so, in my view, the essence of the problem of poetry is the conflict between reality and desire, between appearance and truth, permitting us to achieve some glimpse of the complete image of the world that we do not know.<ref name=Cernuda602>Cernuda OCP vol 1 Palabras antes de una lectura p 602</ref></blockquote>\n\nA significant stage of his development occurred in 1923-24, when he was doing military service.  Every afternoon, along with the other recruits, he had to ride round the outskirts of Seville.  One afternoon, he had an epiphanic experience as if he were seeing things for the first time.  He also felt an uncontrollable need to describe this experience.  This led to the writing of a whole series of poems which have not survived.<ref name=\"Cernuda626\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 626</ref>\n[[Image:The Chapel Emmanuel College2.jpg|thumb|Emmanuel College, Cambridge]]\nAnother crucial phase of his development was his residence in Great Britain between 1938 and 1947.  He learned English and read widely in English literature.  He seems to have had a sense that he was predestined to read English poetry and that it corrected and completed something that was lacking both in his poetry and in himself.<ref name=\"Cernuda645\"/>  He began to see his work in the classroom as analogous to the writing of poetry - the poet should not simply try to communicate the effect of an experience but to direct the reader to retrace the process by which the poet had come to experience what he is writing about.  His attitude to Britain was ambivalent.  He learned a lot from the literature and greatly admired certain aspects of the national character, as displayed in wartime, but found it hard to summon up affection for the country and its people.<ref name=\"Cernuda649-50\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 649-50</ref>  He tried to sum up his ambivalent feelings in the poem \"La partida\", but he considered that he failed to do justice to the theme.<ref name=\"Cernuda653\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 653</ref>\n\n===Collections===\n\n====Primeras poes\u00edas (1924\u20131927)====\n\nThis was the title that Cernuda gave in ''La realidad y el deseo'' to the revised version of his first published work ''Perfil del aire'', which had been published by ''Litoral'' in April 1927.  The collection was dedicated to Salinas, and Cernuda sent a copy to him in Madrid, where he was spending the university vacation.  Cernuda later recalled that this book was greeted by a stream of hostile reviews that tended to concentrate on a perceived lack of novelty and on its indebtedness to Guill\u00e9n.  It also really stung him that Salinas merely sent back a brief acknowledgement of receipt of the book.<ref name=Cernuda629>Cernuda OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 629</ref> He dealt with the apparent debt to Guill\u00e9n in an essay in 1948, in which he points out that in 1927, Guill\u00e9n had yet to publish a collection.  During the 1920s, Guill\u00e9n had published poems here and there in various magazines - including 12 in two separate editions of the ''Revista de Occidente'' in 1924 and 1925 - but this is scarcely sufficient evidence to demonstrate significant influence, given that in December 1925 he himself had had 9 poems published in ''Revista de Occidente''.  His conclusion is that both of them were influenced by the works of Mallarm\u00e9 - in the case of Guill\u00e9n this influence was transmitted via Val\u00e9ry - and shared an interest in pure poetry.<ref name=Cernuda607>Cernuda OCP vol 1 El cr\u00edtico, el amigo y el poeta p 607-624</ref> [[Jos\u00e9 Bergam\u00edn]], however, published a favourable review and Guill\u00e9n himself sent him a letter praising the work and urging him to ignore the reviews.<ref name=Villena15>Villena intro to edition of Las Nubes p 15</ref>  Nevertheless, he was never able to forget the criticism that this work had engendered.  He was too thin-skinned for that.\n\nThe revision process removed ten poems and also some of the stylistic elements that might have triggered comparisons to Guill\u00e9n - such as the use of exclamations and the rhetorical device apostrophe - but in reality the poets are very different in tone.  Guill\u00e9n reaches out joyfully and confidently to reality whereas Cernuda is more hesitant - the world might be an exciting place but something holds him back.<ref name=Connell203 />  Like Guill\u00e9n, Cernuda uses strict metrical forms in this collection, such as the ''d\u00e9cima'' and the sonnet, and there is also an intellectual quality far removed from the folkloric elements that were being used by poets such as Alberti and Lorca, but the emotional restraint is far removed from the world of ''C\u00e1ntico''.  The change of title suggests a recent desire to strip artifice away from his poetry.<ref name=\"Cernuda630\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 630</ref>  There are already poems that reject the real world in favour of a love that will lead to oblivion.  The poet wants to find a place to hide from the world of reality, fully aware that such a retreat or escape can only be temporary.<ref name=Connell203>Connell p 203</ref>  The overriding mood is one of adolescent melancholy.  The debt to Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez is also strong.<ref name=\"Harris notes to Un rio\">Harris intro to Un r\u00edo, un amor etc p 13</ref>\n\n====Egloga, Eleg\u00eda, Oda (1927\u20131928)====\n\nAfter the set-back of the critical reception of ''Perfil del aire'', Cernuda decided to cultivate precisely those things that had been criticised, especially the lack of novelty.  He wrote an eclogue, heavily influenced by his favourite Spanish poet [[Garcilaso de la Vega (poet)|Garcilaso]].  This was published in the first issue of a magazine called ''Carmen'' and was received very favourably by [[Salvador de Madariaga]].  This was followed by an elegy and then by an ode.  Although he came to recognise that writing these poems had helped his technical fluency, he realised that there was something essential that these formal exercises did not allow him to express.<ref name=\"Cernuda631\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 631</ref>  However, he was encouraged to learn that it was possible to write poems of much greater length than was customary at that time, which was an important discovery for him.  In ''Historial de un libro'', he states that at this time he was trying to find an [[objective correlative]] for what he was experiencing - one of the many indications of the influence of [[TS Eliot]] on his work, although this is a rationalisation after the fact because he had yet to read Eliot.<ref name=\"Cernuda632\"/>\n\nThis small group of poems can be read as Cernuda's participation in the G\u00f3ngora tercentenary celebrations - except that he chose to evoke the memories of Garcilaso's eclogues and Luis de Le\u00f3n's odes.<ref name=\"Poesia completa51\">Derek Harris: Introduction to Poes\u00eda completa p 51</ref>  However, their influence is evident only on the form of these poems - the subject-matter is more obviously influenced by Mallarm\u00e9.  The languorous mood recalls \"L'apr\u00e8s-midi d'un Faune\".  There are hints of the poet's admiration for Greek mythology and also of his interest in male physical beauty.<ref name=Connell203 />\n\n====Un r\u00edo, un amor (1929)====\n\nCernuda started work on this collection during his period in Toulouse.  He visited Paris in the Easter vacation of 1929 and was bowled over by the museums and the book-stalls. He spent his days soaking up the sights.  One day, back in Toulouse, he wrote \"Remordimiento en traje de noche\" and discovered a style that enabled him to express poetic needs that he had not been able to communicate up till then.  He had not written any poetry since before his arrival in Toulouse in 1928 but he produced the first 3 poems of the new collection in quick succession. His dissatisafaction with the conventions of fashionable poetry had been freed by contact with surrealism, which for him was not just a literary phenomenon but the expression of an attitude against conformity.<ref name=\"Cernuda634\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 634</ref>  He continued work on this collection after his return to Madrid.\n\nThe influence of the Surrealists is shown by the complexity of the free-flowing imagery, some of it inspired by random discoveries such as the title of a jazz record (as a jazz fan, he used to scour record catalogues and was intrigued by titles such as \"I want to be alone in the South\"), the name of an American city such as Durango or Daytona, a title card from a silent film, or an image from a talking picture such as [[White Shadows in the South Seas]] which he had seen in Paris.  The metrical schemes and rhyme patterns of the first two collections are largely abandoned; only a few of the poems in this book are written in alexandrine quatrains.  Such metrical regularity is not a feature of most surrealist poetry.<ref name=Connell204>Connell p 204</ref>  This was the first collection in which he made use of what he calls free verse.  In reality, this amounts to ignoring classical Spanish verse forms and rhyme schemes, such as ''letrillas'' - in fact, from this point on Cernuda rarely uses full rhyme or even assonance - even though he often felt a need to write in a lyrical style.<ref name=\"Cernuda635\">Cernuda. OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 635</ref>  In a poem such as \"\u00bfSon todos felices?\", Cernuda makes it clear what attracted him to the Surrealists, their protest against society and the pressure to conform.  In this poem, honour, patriotism and duty are seen as worthless in comparison to the suffering they inflict on the rebel or non-conformist.  Just being alive and living according to the rules is equivalent to being dead.  It is noteworthy that this poem contains the first unequivocal expression of homoerotic attraction in his poetry.<ref name=\"Harris notes to Un rio82\">Harris notes to Un r\u00edo, un amor p 82</ref>  The collection, like its successor, remained unpublished until 1936, when they were gathered into the first edition of ''La realidad y el deseo''.\n\n====Los placeres prohibidos (1931)====\n\nThe poems gathered in this and the previous collection came to Cernuda fully formed.  The poems that eventually got published were the same as the first drafts, which was very different from his experience with his first two collections.<ref name=\"Cernuda637\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 637</ref>\n\nThe poet's homosexuality is made defiantly manifest in this collection.  However, the title of the work suggests that there were other \"forbidden pleasures\" and he explores various ways of defying the norms of bourgeois behaviour.  It is the product of an intensive period of literary production between April and June 1931, when Alfonso XIII abdicated and the Spanish Republic was proclaimed.<ref name=\"Harris notes to Un rio85\">Harris notes to Un r\u00edo etc p 85</ref>  In \"Dir\u00e9 c\u00f3mo nacisteis\", Cernuda launches a war cry against a society in decay that represses and imprisons people who transgress the social norms of love.  And in the next poem, \"Telara\u00f1as cuelgan de la raz\u00f3n\", he sets up the other major mood of the collection, an elegiac mood of sorrow.<ref name=\"Harris notes to Un rio89\">Harris notes to Un r\u00edo etc p 89</ref> The poems in this book draw a distinction between the poet's freedom of imagination and the accepted rules of life that confine and limit his freedom.<ref name=Connell205>Connell p 205</ref>  The predominant tone is one of desolation, recalling the transitory nature of love and the emptiness it leaves in its wake.  In \"De qu\u00e9 pa\u00eds\", Cernuda looks at a newborn child and depicts the betrayal of his sense of wonder and innocence by the way the adult world imposes artificial codes of behaviour and a sense of guilt when the code is transgressed.  It is a theme that is explored many times in his oeuvre.\n\n====Donde habite el olvido (1932\u20131933)====\n\nThis book resulted from a love affair that ended badly.  Derek Harris has identified the other man as Seraf\u00edn F. Ferro.<ref name=\"Poesia completa\" />  In \"Aprendiendo olvido\", one of the prose poems included in ''Ocnos'', Cernuda alludes to this episode.  In later years, he was embarrassed by the candour with which he treated it, attributing this to the slowness of his emotional development, and admitted that this section of his oeuvre was one of the least-satisfying for him.<ref name=\"Cernuda639\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 639</ref>\n\nIn this collection, Cernuda steps away from surrealism, feeling that what was lying around hidden in the depths of his subconscious had been dredged sufficiently.  Instead of what he had come to see as the artifice and triviality of hermetic images deriving from the flow of thoughts through the poet's mind, he turned to the example of the 19thc. poet [[Gustavo Adolfo B\u00e9cquer]], who produced tightly controlled poetry on the subject of lost love.<ref name=\"Cernuda639\"/>  Cernuda continued to eschew rhyme and assonance but, like B\u00e9cquer's ''Rimas'' the stanzas are short and self-contained and their language is restrained.<ref name=Connell206>Connell p 206</ref>  Sometimes, the poems return to the world of the ''Primeras poes\u00edas''.\n\nIn \"III\", the theme is the emptiness left by the passing of love - just as in \"Telara\u00f1as cuelgan de la raz\u00f3n\" from ''Los placeres prohibidos'' - but rendered in a much simpler, more lyrical fashion.  \"IV\" shows how the dreams and aspirations of youth are destroyed when they soar too high - probably a reference to the myth of Icarus.  \"VII\" returns to the enclosed world of the early poems, suggesting that despite all his experiences the poet is still an unfulfilled dreamer. \"XII\" suggests that love alone makes life real.  It persists as a universal force even though it might have died in a particular individual.<ref name=Connell206 />  The ideas behind surrealism are still present, although the presentation of them is markedly different.\n\n====Invocaciones (1934\u20131935)====\n\nThis collection was originally called ''Invocaciones a las gracias del mundo'' but Cernuda later shortened it to make it seem less pompous.  Tired with the habitual brevity of poems in the tradition of [[Antonio Machado]] or Jim\u00e9nez, he starts to write much longer poems than hitherto.  When he started work on these poems, he realised that their subject-matter needed greater length for him to be able to express everything he needed to say about them.  He cast off all the remaining traces of \"pure\" poetry.<ref name=\"Cernuda640\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 640</ref>  He also notes, however, that there is a tendency to ramble at the beginning of certain poems in this book as well as a degree of bombast.\n\nHis principal subject-matter is still essentially himself and his thoughts but he starts to view things in a more objective way: the poetry is more analytical.  For example, in \"Soliloquio del farero\",  the poet finds an escape from desperation in an enclosed and solitary world very similar to that of his earliest poems.  The poem is addressed to his \"friend\" - solitude - and he develops the idea that he has been chosen to serve mankind in some way by being separated from them, just like a lighthouse-keeper. Other poems in the collection allude to Greek mythology or a golden age of innocence that has been lost.<ref name=Connell206 />  Early in 1935, Cernuda made the acquaintance of Stanley Richardson and dedicated \"Por unos tulipanes amarillos\" to him.<ref name=\"Stanley Richardson and Spain\" />\n\n====Las nubes (1937\u20131940)====\n\nThis collection was written during the Spanish Civil War and amidst all the disruption and uncertainty in Cernuda's life as he went into exile, drifting from Madrid, to London, to Paris, to Cranleigh and finally to Glasgow.  Meditations about his isolation in foreign countries and about Spain, particularly about his growing feeling that nothing in Spain was going to change for the better and that intolerance, ignorance and superstition were winning the struggle,<ref name=Cernuda642 />  are the major themes.  Stylistically, there is an increased concentration on clarity and simplicity of diction and his control over his means of expression is growing.<ref name=Connell207 />   He often uses combinations of 7 and 11 syllable lines.\n\nWhen he left Madrid in February 1938, he took 8 new poems with him.<ref name=\"Cernuda645\"/>   In London, he wrote 6 more.  He wrote \"L\u00e1zaro\" while [[Neville Chamberlain|Chamberlain]] and [[Hitler]] were negotiating about Czechoslovakia, and the poem is written in a mood of melancholy calm, trying to express the disenchanted surprise that a dead man might feel on being brought back to life.<ref name=\"Cernuda646\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 646</ref>  During his stay with the colony of evacuated Basque children at Eaton Hastings, he befriended a boy called I\u00f1aki who had quickly mastered English and showed such promise that Lord Faringdon was prepared to finance his education at a private school - an offer refused by the boy on political grounds, according to the story told by Cernuda to his fellow \u00e9migr\u00e9 Rafael Mart\u00ednez Nadal.  Shortly afterwards, the boy fell ill and was taken to the [[Radcliffe Infirmary]].  On March 27, he was close to death.  He refused the last sacraments and turned away from the crucifix held out by a priest.  He wanted to see Cernuda, however, and asked him to read a poem.  He then turned to the wall and died.  This was the inspiration for the poem \"Ni\u00f1o muerto\", written in May 1938.<ref name=\"Murphy: Pub Poets\"/>\n\nA key poem in the collection is \"A Larra, con unas violetas (1837-1937)\", in which he identifies himself with [[Mariano Jos\u00e9 de Larra]], the brilliant, satirical journalist of 19thc. Madrid. Larra was a fierce critic of the governments of his day and of the state of Spanish society but was at heart very patriotic.  Cernuda sees in Larra a kindred spirit, embittered, misunderstood, isolated and unsuccessful in love.<ref name=Connell207>Connell p 207</ref>\n\n====Como quien espera el alba (1941\u20131944)====\n\nThis work was begun during his 1941 vacation in Oxford, continued in Glasgow and completed at Cambridge in 1944.  The autumn, winter and spring of 1941-2 was one of the most fertile periods of his life and it seems that this collection was one of his favourites.<ref name=\"Cernuda648\"/>  He read widely in English poetry and criticism and made acquaintance with the writings of TS Eliot, Dr Johnson, Coleridge, Matthew Arnold and Keats's letters amongst others.<ref name=\"Cernuda647\"/>  He also began to read Goethe and Kierkegaard.<ref name=\"Cernuda649\"/>  Whilst this extensive reading does not show through specifically in any poem, his handling of longer poems is more assured.<ref name=Connell207 />  There are poems that suggest a nostalgia for the Seville of his youth - not an emotion that Cernuda often displays, but a longing for bright sunshine and warmth is easily explicable in the circumstances.  It is only in such indirect ways that a reader can sense what was happening around him. Glasgow was bombed 5 times by the [[Luftwaffe]] in [[the Blitz]] and suffered extensive damage but it would be impossible to gather this from reading Cernuda.\n\nIn an extended poem, \"Noche del hombre y su demonio\", he reflects on the course of his life and the possibility of being remembered after his death.<ref name=Connell208>:Connell p 208</ref>   The ''demonio'' attacks the concept of the poet's vocation and suggests that Cernuda might sometimes have been tempted to try to live a normal life.  \"G\u00f3ngora\" is another poem that takes a historical figure and projects the poet's own psychological state onto him.\n\nThe title of the collection alludes to the atmosphere of Britain during the Second World War when \"it was only possible to hope for an end to the world's retreat into a primitive world of darkness and terror, in the middle of which England was like the ark in which Noah survived the flood.\"<ref name=\"Cernuda649\"/>\n\n====Vivir sin estar viviendo (1944\u20131949)====\n\nBegun in Cambridge, continued in London and completed in America, this is very similar to the previous collection in that it contains a mix of introspective and self-analytical works and shorter impressionist poems.  As a result of his reading of H\u00f6lderlin, Cernuda had started to use [[enjambement]].  His increasing use of this device gave his poetry a duality of rhythm - the rhythm of the individual line and the rhythm of the phrase.  Since he tended not to use rhyme or even assonance, the rhythm of the line tends to be swamped by that of the phrase, resulting in an effect that is often close to prose.<ref name=\"Cernuda650\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 650</ref>\n\nThe first eight poems were written in Cambridge and he added another 13 which he wrote during holidays in Cornwall.  The title alludes to the state of mind in which he found himself at that time - living vicariously in foreign countries where he scarcely knew anybody.  His voracious reading was taking the place of living.  He could see nothing ahead of him but death.<ref name=\"Cernuda656\" />\n\n====Con las horas contadas (1950\u20131956)====\n\nThis collection was started in Mount Holyoke during the winter of 1950 and completed in Mexico.  One of the most noteworthy things about this book is that it contains a group of poems - ''Poemas para un cuerpo'' - about an intensely physical affair he had with an unidentified man in Mexico.  The title suggests not merely Cernuda's obsession with the passing of time but also the sense of strangeness he felt whilst living this amorous adventure - an old man in love as he describes himself.<ref name=\"Cernuda658\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 658</ref>  As already stated, this was one of the happiest times in his life.  The bulk of the poems in the collection are shorter than in previous books and start to incorporate assonance more frequently in an attempt to concentrate the thematic material rather than explore it at length and also to seem more purely lyrical.<ref name=Cernuda658 />\n\n\"El elegido\" is an objective account of the choosing, preparation and killing of an Aztec sacrificial victim.  It is recounted in very simple language but it clearly picks up on the thoughts behind the soliloquy in ''Invocaciones''. The poem presents an allegory of the choosing, beguilement and final destruction of the poet by life or the \"daimonic\" power.<ref name=Connell208 />\n\n====Desolaci\u00f3n de la Quimera (1956\u20131962)====\n\nCernuda's last book of poems is a summing up of his career.  It was published in Mexico in November 1962.<ref name=\"Poesia completa\" />   It mingles poems in the style of his first book with epigrammatic works and extended reveries in his mature style.  There are poems that are derived from song-titles or catch-phrases - \"Otra vez, con sentimiento\" - and historical poems about figures such as Mozart, Verlaine and Rimbaud, Keats, Goethe, Ludwig of Bavaria.  In \"Ni\u00f1o tras un cristal\", he completes a cycle of poems about the unawareness and hope of a child before its corruption by the world - a theme present right from the start of his poetic career.<ref name=Connell208 />\n\nIt is clear that he knew that his life was coming to a close and he wanted to settle his accounts.  This is shown by the titles of poems such as \"Antes de irse\", \"Dos de noviembre\", \"Del otro lado\", \"Ep\u00edlogo\" and \"Despedida\".  There are direct links to previous collections.  For example, \"Ep\u00edlogo\" is explicitly related to the ''Poemas para un cuerpo'',  and \"Pregunta vieja, vieja respuesta\" links back to ''Donde habite el olvido''.<ref name=\"Villena introduction43\">Villena intro to Las Nubes etc p 43</ref>\n\nHe also returns to the theme of Spain, which had first appeared in ''Las nubes'', analysing what he admires and dislikes.<ref name=\"Villena introduction44\">Villena intro to Las Nubes etc p 44</ref>  There are poems about other poets he knew, sometimes splenetic in tone.  The major theme is, however, that of the impossibility of finding happiness in a world where desire and reality diverge - cf \"Hablando a Manona\", \"Luna llena en Semana Santa\", or \"M\u00fasica cautiva\".<ref name=\"Villena introduction55\">Villena intro to Las Nubes etc p 55</ref>  However, he does find some kind of consolation in the realm of art - listening to Mozart's music, or considering the world of Goethe compared with that of Napoleon's drunken soldiers.<ref name=\"Villena introduction55\" />  Also, by this time, he had gathered some degree of fame in Spain and there were signs that people were responding to his writings.  In \"Peregrino\", he reacts to enquiries about whether he might return to his homeland in a characteristically grumpy way which shades into a tone of resolute stoicism as he explains that he is driven to keep moving forward and can never return to the past.<ref name=Connell209>Connell p 209</ref>\n\n===Influences===\n\nIt was at the urging of Pedro Salinas that Cernuda began to read classical Spanish poets such as [[Garcilaso de la Vega (poet)|Garcilaso]], [[Luis de Le\u00f3n]], [[Luis de G\u00f3ngora|G\u00f3ngora]], [[Lope de Vega]], [[Francisco de Quevedo|Quevedo]] and [[Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca|Calder\u00f3n de la Barca]].  He also urged him to learn French and to read modern French literature, in particular [[Andr\u00e9 Gide]] and the poetry of [[Baudelaire]], [[St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9|Mallarm\u00e9]] and [[Rimbaud]].<ref name=\"Cernuda627\"/>  Cernuda also became acquainted with the poetry of [[Pierre Reverdy]] and counts him as a major influence over the poems in his first collection, ''Perfil del aire'', for his qualities of spareness, purity and reticence.<ref name=\"Cernuda627\"/>  No contemporary critic recognised this influence.  In ''Un r\u00edo, un amor'', ''Destierro'' echoes Reverdy's poetry in its evocation of a solitary existence in a hostile urban world.<ref name=\"Harris notes to Un rio55\">Harris notes to Un r\u00edo etc p 55</ref>   He also read [[Comte de Lautr\u00e9amont|Lautr\u00e9amont]]'s ''Les Chants de Maldoror'' and ''Pr\u00e9face a un livre futur'', although their influence emerged at a later time.\n\nJust before he completed ''Perfil del aire'', in March 1926, the Madrid book-seller Le\u00f3n S\u00e1nchez Cuesta had already delivered to him a copy of ''Le Libertinage'' by Louis Aragon.<ref name=\"Harris notes to Un rio\" /> In the time just after the publication of ''Perfil del aire'', he began to read other books by the leaders of the [[Surrealist]] movement - [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]], [[Paul Eluard]], [[Louis Aragon]] and [[Ren\u00e9 Crevel]]. He strongly identified with their boldness and their sense of alienation from their society<ref name=\"Cernuda632\"/> and this emerges clearly in his third and fourth collections.\n\nWhile he was halfway through writing the poems of ''Invocaciones'', he began to read [[H\u00f6lderlin]], which he describes as one of his greatest experiences in poetry.<ref name=\"Cernuda640\"/>  He had grown tired of the very restricted range of literature championed by the French surrealists and was starting to interest himself in English and German poetry.  In order to read them, he began to learn these languages.  He was enthralled by the depth and poetic beauty that he discovered in H\u00f6lderlin and discovered not just a new vision of the world but also a new means of poetic expression.<ref name=\"Cernuda641\"/>\nDuring his stay in Paris in 1936, he bought a copy of the [[Greek Anthology]] in a French translation.  He was stimulated by the concise and penetrating style of these poems and epigrams.<ref name=\"Cernuda642\"/>\n\nAfter his move to Great Britain in September 1938, Cernuda continued the exploration of English literature that he had begun the previous spring.  While he was reading Eliot, Blake, Keats, Shakespeare's plays, he was struck by their lack of verbal ornamentation compared with Spanish and French poetry.  He discovered that a poet could achieve a deeper poetic effect by not shouting or declaiming, or repeating himself, by avoiding bombast and grandiloquence.  As in those epigrams in the Greek anthology, he admired the way that concision could give a precise shape to a poem.  He learned to avoid two literary vices, the [[pathetic fallacy]] and \"purple patches\", avoiding undue subjectivity or features that did not fit in with the overall conception of the poem.<ref name=\"Cernuda646\"/>  The tendencies had been there, to gradually increasing extent, in his poetry from the outset but his reading confirmed him on this route.  He also read [[Robert Browning|Browning]] and learned how to take a dramatic, historic or legendary situation and to project his own emotional state onto it, in order to achieve greater objectivity, as in poems such as ''L\u00e1zaro, Quetzalc\u00f3atl, Silla del Rey'', or ''El C\u00e9sar''.<ref name=\"Cernuda647\"/> \n \nAt Mount Holyoke he started to read ''Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker (The Fragments of the Presocratics)'' by [[Hermann Diels]] with the help of an English translation.  In Mexico, he read [[John Burnet (classicist)|John Burnet]]'s ''Early Greek Philosophy''.  These fragments of pre-Socratic thought seemed to him the most profound and poetic philosophical works he had ever read.  The world of ancient Greece is often recalled in his poetry.<ref name=\"Cernuda657\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 657</ref>  It recalled his childhood reading of a book of Greek mythology which, even at that early age, had been sufficient to make his religious beliefs seem sad and depressing.  He tried to express something of that experience in ''El poeta y los mitos'' in ''Ocnos''.<ref name=Cernuda657 />\n\n===Poetics:  the role of the poet and poetry===\n\nCernuda's poetry shows a continual process of stripping away artifice and modish elements.  This accounts in part for the abrupt changes in style and tone between various collections.  He was also convinced that a poet needs to gain as much variety of experience and knowledge as possible, otherwise his work will be pallid and restricted.<ref name=\"Cernuda639\"/>  A poet's work should reflect his growth, his intellectual and emotional development.\n\nWhen he describes things, it is his individual perception of them that he is trying to convey, what they mean to him, rather than their objective existence.  However, after his early collections, he rarely uses the first-person.  He frequently tries to create a sense of distance from his poetry by using the \"t\u00fa\" form but the person he is addressing is usually himself.  The effect of this is that much of his poetry seems to be a self-conscious interior monologue.<ref name=\"Gibbons intro 13\" />   In part, this is because he was always conscious of a difference between the Cernuda who lived and suffered and the Cernuda who wrote poetry.<ref name=Cernuda625 /> In part, it is also probably a result of his natural reticence and caution against disclosing too much of himself, despite the fact that personal history lies behind much of his output.  Whereas Browning might use a figure such as [[Fra Lippo Lippi (poem)|Fra Lippo Lippi]] or [[Andrea del Sarto (poem)|Andrea del Sarto]] to live imaginatively what he would not present as his own experience, Cernuda's characters have Cernuda's voice and present versions or aspects of his own thoughts and feelings.<ref name=\"Gibbons intro 13\">Gibbons intro to Selected Poems p 13</ref>\n\nHe was convinced that he was driven by an inner daimon to write poetry and that the poet is in touch with a spiritual dimension of life that normal people are either blind to or shut off from.<ref name=Cernuda604>Cernuda OCP vol 1 Palabras antes de una lectura p 604</ref>  it is a topic which he alludes to frequently in his critical writings.  His urge to write poetry was not under his control.  Reading some lines of poetry, hearing some notes of music, seeing an attractive person could be the external influence that led to a poem but what was important was to try to express the real, deep-lying poetic impulse, which was sometimes powerful enough to make him shiver or burst into tears.<ref name=\"Cernuda638\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 638</ref>\n\nAlthough he was a self-absorbed person, dedicated to the art of writing poetry, he was vulnerable enough to need to know that he had an audience.  After November 1947, when an edition of ''Como quien espera el alba'' was published in Buenos Aires, rumours of its favourable reception reached him in Mount Holyoke.  He was gratified to learn that he was starting to find an audience and that his name was getting mentioned when Spanish poetry was discussed.<ref name=\"Cernuda655\"/>\n\n==Translations==\n\nDuring the writing of ''Invocaciones'', he met the German philosopher and linguist [[Jean Gebser|Hans Gebser]], who was living and working in Madrid.  This was at a time when Cernuda was beginning to become enthused by the poetry of [[H\u00f6lderlin]] and, with his help he began to translate selected poems.  These appeared in ''Cruz y Raya'' in early 1936.<ref name=\"Cernuda641\"/>  Because his knowledge of German was rudimentary, he made an error in translating the final line of one of the poems.  A second edition was published in Mexico in 1942 but, since Bergam\u00edn did not advise him of this and Cernuda himself was living in Scotland at the time, he was unable to correct this and other infelicities.\n\nDuring his time in London, probably 1946, he began to translate Shakespeare's [[Troilus and Cressida]] into Spanish.  This was a task that taught him a lot and which gave him a great deal of satisfaction.<ref name=\"Cernuda652\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Historial de un libro p 652</ref>\n\n==Prose poetry and criticism==\n\nCernuda produced two collections of prose poetry.  ''Ocnos'' was originally published in 1942 in London.  Subsequent augmented editions were published in Madrid in 1949 and Xalapa in 1963.  ''Variaciones sobre tema mexicano'' was published in 1952.\n\nHe published critical articles all through his career however he also produced 4 major works of criticism:\n* ''Estudios sobre poes\u00eda espa\u00f1ola contempor\u00e1nea'' (Madrid 1957) in a heavily bowdlerised version that omitted the chapters relating to living figures such as Guill\u00e9n, Aleixandre, Altolaguirre, Diego and Alberti.\n* ''Pensamiento po\u00e9tico en la l\u00edrica inglesa'' (Mexico 1958)\n* ''Poes\u00eda y literatura, I y II'' (Barcelona 1960, 1964)\n\n==Cernuda and his contemporaries==\n\n===Salinas and Guill\u00e9n===\n\nHe came to the attention of Pedro Salinas in his first year at Seville University - 1920-21 - and recorded, as late as 1958, that he would probably never have found his vocation as a poet had it not been for the older man's encouragement.<ref name=\"Cernuda627\"/>  However, his attitude towards Salinas seems to have been quite complex, as far as can be judged from his writings.  In 1929 and 1930, his growing political militancy, inspired by his attraction to surrealism, made it difficult for him to tolerate friends whom he had come to consider bourgeois - such as Guill\u00e9n, Salinas and even Aleixandre.<ref name=\"Cernuda637\"/>  Even though he might have reverted to friendly terms with Salinas and Guill\u00e9n (it seems unlikely that he would have shunned Aleixandre), in a collection of essays published in 1957, ''Estudios sobre Poes\u00eda espa\u00f1ola contempor\u00e1nea'', it is possible to see that he continues to view them as adhering to a different conception of poetry.  For Cernuda, a true poet has to break away from society in some way, even if he might live a lifestyle that looks totally conventional from the outside, and these two poets never managed to do that.<ref name=\"Cernuda196\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Salinas y Guill\u00e9n p 196</ref>  He does not approve of the playful qualities in Salinas's poetry and his seeming refusal to deal with profound subjects.<ref name=\"Cernuda197\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Salinas y Guill\u00e9n p 197</ref>  When he considers the change that came over Salinas's poetry with ''La voz a ti debida'', he dismisses it as\n\n<blockquote>just another game, a desire to show that he was as human as the next man.<ref name=\"Cernuda199\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Salinas y Guill\u00e9n p 199</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn truth, the poetry of Salinas was alien to Cernuda - so alien as to be antipathetic to him.  His personal relationship with Salinas had probably never fully recovered from the blow of his apparent rejection of ''Perfil del aire'' in 1927.  Not even his favourable review of the first edition of ''La realidad y el deseo'' seems to have appeased Cernuda for long.  Salinas wrote an introduction to an anthology of Spanish poetry that was published in the 1940s and referred to Cernuda as ''el m\u00e1s Licenciado Vidriera de los poetas'', an allusion to a famous short story by [[Cervantes]] in which the hero retreats timorously from life under the delusion that he is made of glass.<ref name=\"Licenciado Vidriera\">[[El licenciado Vidriera]]</ref>   In a poem called \"Malentendu\", included in ''Desolaci\u00f3n de la Quimera'', Cernuda launches a bitter attack on a man who, he claims, consistently misunderstood and ill-treated him, alluding specifically to that description.\n\nHis contacts with Guill\u00e9n seem to have been more sporadic.  Cernuda clearly valued his supportive words when ''Perfil del aire'' first appeared and he does not seem to have done anything to vex Cernuda.  However the latter's assessment is based solely on the evidence of ''C\u00e1ntico'' - the later collections had not begun to appear when Cernuda wrote about him.  Clearly, the poet who wrote in \"Beato sill\u00f3n\" that\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nEl mundo est\u00e1 bien\nHecho\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nhas a different view of reality than Cernuda.  Nevertheless, Cernuda respects his dedication to his poetry and his commitment to revising it and making it better.  However, he does regret that Guill\u00e9n should have expended so much care and energy on expounding such a limited view of life.<ref name=\"Cernuda203\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Salinas y Guill\u00e9n p 203</ref>  He notes what he views as Guill\u00e9n's tendency to draw everything he sees into a contained, bourgeois viewpoint.<ref name=\"Cernuda202\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Salinas y Guill\u00e9n p 202</ref>  He also notes the way that when Guill\u00e9n writes about Lorca, the latter's life and works become a personal affair of the Guill\u00e9n family.  His assessment ends in a contradictory way.  He views Guiill\u00e9n as a poet in the manner of [[Coventry Patmore]] - a now forgotten 19thc. British poet - and yet also one of the 3 or 4 finest poets of his generation.<ref name=\"Cernuda205\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Salinas y Guill\u00e9n p 205</ref>\n\n===Aleixandre===\n\nOne of the first things that Cernuda did on arriving in Madrid in 1928 was to pay a visit to Vicente Aleixandre.<ref name=Cernuda633 />  This was their first meeting.  However, they did not immediately become friends and Cernuda blames it on his own timidity and distrust.<ref name=\"Cernuda2201\">Cernuda: OCP vol 2 Vicente Aleixandre (1950) p 201</ref>  He was struck by Aleixandre's warmth and friendliness, not realising until a later date that his visit had been during the hours when Aleixandre, for the sake of his health, would normally have been resting. Unfortunately he was also struck by Aleixandre's calmness and the sense of ease that he exuded at being in familiar surroundings.  For Cernuda, who was always uneasy about feeling at home anywhere, this was a reason for deciding that he did not want to see Aleixandre again.<ref name=\"Cernuda2202\">Cernuda: OCP vol 2 Vicente Aleixandre (1950) p 202</ref>\n\nAfter his return to Madrid from Toulouse in June 1929, he met Aleixandre again: he recounts that it was Aleixandre who re-introduced himself to Cernuda as he himself did not recognise him.  Gradually, over the course of many meetings, Cernuda's habitual reserve and distrust faded.  His friendship with Vicente Aleixandre developed into the closest he had ever had.  They often met in Aleixandre's house, sometimes with Lorca and Altolaguirre there as well.  Aleixandre seems to have had a special gift for friendship, because he also became one of Lorca's closest friends (according to Ian Gibson).<ref name=Gibson199>Gibson p 199</ref> and Cernuda notes specifically his skill as an attentive and sympathetic listener.  The implication is that he was trusted with the intimate confessions of many of his friends.<ref name=\"Cernuda2204\">Cernuda: OCP vol 2 Vicente Aleixandre (1950) p 204</ref> Cernuda also gives a very favourable account of Aleixandre's poetry in ''Estudios sobre poes\u00eda espa\u00f1ola contempor\u00e1nea'', seeing in his work the struggle of a man of intense feeling trapped inside a sick body,<ref name=\"Cernuda228\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Vicente Aleixandre p 228</ref> an analogous situation to his own struggle for fulfilment.\n\nHowever, not even Aleixandre was able to escape from Cernuda's sensitivity about his future reputation.  In the 1950s, he wrote a few essays on his memories of Cernuda, which of course were fixed in the late 1920s and early 1930s.  He describes his friend's apparent detachment from the world and unwillingness to engage.  No attempt was made to see whether that old image still fitted the man who had gone through all the upheaval that Cernuda had experienced while going into exile.  Perhaps more importantly, there was no attempt made to dissociate the poetry written by Cernuda, from Cernuda the man as Aleixandre had known him 20 years earlier.<ref name=\"Harris A Study12\">Harris A Study of the Poetry p12</ref>\n\n===Lorca===\n\nCernuda's relationship with Lorca was one of the most important in his life, notwithstanding the fact of its brevity. He first met Lorca in Seville in December 1927, during the celebrations in honour of G\u00f3ngora.  He recalled this meeting in an article he wrote in 1938.<ref name=Cernuda2148>Cernuda OCP vol 2 Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca (1938) p148-154</ref>  They met on the patio of a hotel in the evening.  Cernuda was struck by the contrast between Lorca's large, eloquent, melancholy eyes and his thickset peasant's body. He was not favourably impressed by his theatrical manner and by the way he was surrounded by hangers-on - reminiscent of a matador.  However, something drew them together: ''Something that I hardly understood or did not wish to acknowledge began to unite us....he took me by the arm and we left the others.''\n\nHe next met Lorca three years later in Aleixandre's apartment in Madrid<ref name=\"Cernuda637\"/> after Lorca's return from New York and Cuba.  He noticed that something in Lorca had changed; he was less precious, less melancholy and more sensual.<ref name=Cernuda2148 />\n\nConsidering the friendship between them and his admiration for Lorca, Cernuda is dispassionate in his assessments of Lorca's poetry.  He is not a whole-hearted admirer of the ''Romancero gitano'', for example, unimpressed by the obscurity of the narratives in many of the individual poems and by the theatricality and outmoded [[costumbrismo]] of the collection as a whole.<ref name=\"Cernuda210\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca p 210</ref>  When he discusses ''Canciones'', he deplores the jokiness of some of the poems -\n\n<blockquote>an attitude unworthy of a poet, but more appropriate to the son of a wealthy family who, comfortable in his very bourgeois status, is able to mock it, because he knows that it will not cost him anything and that it will earn him the reputation of being a smart, witty chap.</blockquote>\n\nHe notes that this is a fleeting characteristic in Lorca but more persistent in someone such as Alberti.<ref name=\"Cernuda211\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca p 210-211</ref>  For Cernuda, poetry is a serious business and he tends not to approve of people who take it lightly.  It also tends to show how his criticism is guided by his own principles.  He tends to be more lenient in his judgments of poets who are like him.  He seems to approve of the fact that after the success of the ''Romancero gitano'', Lorca continued along his own track, not seduced into writing more gypsy ballads.<ref name=\"Cernuda211_2\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca p 211</ref>  In ''Poeta en Nueva York'', a collection not published in Spain in Lorca's lifetime, Cernuda identifies the heart of the collection as the \"Oda a Walt Whitman\".  This is interesting as it is a poem in which Lorca clearly shows his identification with homosexuals<ref name=Gibson297>Gibson p 297</ref> but Cernuda's reference is rather obscure -\n\n<blockquote>in it the poet gives voice to a feeling that was the very reason of his existence and work.  Because of that it is a pity that this poem is so confused, in spite of its expressive force.<ref name=\"Cernuda212\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca p 212</ref></blockquote>\n \nOn March 8, 1933, he was present at the premiere in Madrid of Garc\u00eda Lorca's play ''Bodas de sangre''.<ref name=Gibson348>Gibson p348</ref> but he makes no reference to it, or indeed to any of Lorca's plays in his writings.  He notes at the end of the chapter on Lorca in ''Estudios sobre Poes\u00eda espa\u00f1ola contempor\u00e1nea'' that Lorca's later poems give clear signs to suggest that he had a lot more to say at the time of his death and that his style was developing in emotional force.<ref name=\"Cernuda214\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca p 214</ref>\n\nCernuda wrote an elegy for Lorca which he included in ''Las nubes'' and to the end of his life took pains to try to ensure that the image of Lorca was not academicised, that he remained a figure of vitality, rebellion and nonconformism.<ref name=\"Villena introduction50\" />\n\n===D\u00e1maso Alonso===\n\nIn 1948, Cernuda published an open letter to the famous critic D\u00e1maso Alonso in reaction to an article by the latter titled ''Una generaci\u00f3n po\u00e9tica (1920-36)''.<ref name=Cernuda2198>Cernuda OCP vol 2 Carta abierta a D\u00e1maso Alonso p 198-200</ref>   He takes exception to 2 passages:\n#Cernuda, at that time very young\n#Cernuda was still a boy, almost isolated in Seville, in the year of our excursion to Seville, the same year in which ''Perfil del aire'' appeared in M\u00e1laga, which neither represents his mature work....\n\nHe points out that he was 25 at this time, so can scarcely be considered \"very young\" or a \"boy\".  As for his isolation in Seville, Alonso should recall that he had already had poems published in the ''Revista de Occidente'' and elsewhere.  However, it is noteworthy that in his later essay, ''Historial de un libro'', he used the same expression to depict his sense of confusion at the hostile reviews to his first collection.<ref name=Cernuda629 />  He also criticises Alonso's use of the word \"mature\".  He points out the essential inconsistency in saying that the poet was young and then expecting maturity in his early work.  He then states that for him the key factor is not whether a poem is mature or not but whether it has artistic merit.  He goes on to say that, even after the passage of time, he still prefers some of his earlier poems to certain poems written later.\n\nThe major complaint he raises is that this critique is just a lazy repetition of the initial critical reaction in 1927.<ref name=Cernuda2198 />  One of his key beliefs is that there are poets who find their audience at once and poets who have to wait for an audience to come to them - he reiterates this in ''Historial de un libro''.<ref name=Cernuda641 />  He is one of the latter.  So when people like Alonso, who rejected his early work and still persist in calling it immature, now say he is a fine poet, he takes that to mean that they are merely picking up on the favourable reactions of people 20 years younger to his recent works - in other words, the audience that has found him - and that they are unable to see the continuities between the earlier and the later work.\n\nThis develops into a key theme of Cernuda's final collection.  In \"Malentendu\", he shows his unease that his own reputation could be shaped beyond the grave by the perceptions of someone such as Pedro Salinas and his reference to ''El Licenciado Vidriera''.  In \"Otra vez, con sentimiento\", he shows the same unease on behalf of Lorca.  Alonso had written in the same article (''Una generaci\u00f3n po\u00e9tica (1920-36)'') a tribute to Lorca, calling him \"my prince\".  Cernuda is keen to save his old friend from appropriation by reactionary forces, defending his unconventional lifestyle (homosexuality) and everything else about him that would prevent him from being free to live in Franco's Spain.<ref name=\"Villena introduction50\">Villena intro to Las Nubes etc p 50</ref>\n\n===Alberti and political commitment===\n\nAlberti was another of the people whom he met for the first time in the G\u00f3ngora celebrations in Seville in 1927.  Alberti describes him as ''dark, thin, extremely refined and meticulous''.<ref name=Alberti239>Alberti p. 239</ref>  However, it is not likely that Alberti ever became close to Cernuda although the latter contributed to many of the former's journals during the early 1930s.  Alberti invited him to contribute to the celebratory album that he was editing<ref name=Alberti242>Alberti p. 242</ref> but Cernuda did not follow it up.  His relationship with Alberti is suggestive of the pathways along which his mind was moving after his initial contact with surrealism.  In 1933, for example, he wrote for Alberti's magazine ''Octubre'' a piece called ''Los que se incorporan (Those who join up)''.  In it he calls for the destruction of bourgeois society:  ''I trust in a revolution inspired by communism to achieve this''.<ref name=Cernuda2_63>Cernuda OCP vol 2 Los que se incorporan p 63</ref>\n\nIn an article written for ''Hora de Espa\u00f1a'' in 1937, he wrote that: ''the poet is inevitably a revolutionary... a revolutionary with full awareness of his responsibility''.<ref name=Cernuda2121>Cernuda OCP vol 2 L\u00edneas sobre los poetas y para los poetas en los d\u00edas actuales p 121</ref>  However, by that time, it seems clear that he did not expect poets to get directly involved in revolutionary actions.  In an essay devoted to Aleixandre in 1950 he goes so far as to say that, for a poet to take the course of direct action ''is absurd and tends to ruin the poet as a poet''.<ref name=\"Cernuda2207\">Cernuda: OCP vol 2 Vicente Aleixandre (1950) p 207</ref>\n\nThis attitude seems to colour his response to Alberti's poetic output but it is noticeable that he does try to differentiate between the man and the poet.  It is clear that he was always in favour of Alberti's efforts on behalf of exploited Spaniards.  The problem is that Alberti stepped over Cernuda's line where poetry becomes activism.  A key point in Cernuda's view of Alberti's poetry is that Alberti seemed to lack any sense of self.<ref name=\"Cernuda220\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Rafael Alberti p 220</ref>  He also highlights the fact that Alberti was a virtuoso versifier, able to counterfeit the manner of Gil Vicente or any other folk poet.  Cernuda does not approve of the playfulness that Alberti shows in his first three collections.<ref name=Cernuda220 /> He does not believe that Alberti rises above the level of his models, such as G\u00f3ngora and Guill\u00e9n in ''Cal y canto'' - in other words he sees Alberti as a parodist rather than as an original poet.<ref name=\"Cernuda221\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Rafael Alberti p 221</ref>  There is a sense in which he envies the fact that Alberti became so successful so rapidly, using him as an example of a poet who found his public immediately.<ref name=Cernuda221 /> And yet, he ends up by praising his poetic fluency while stating that he had nothing to say and that his work is basically deprived of passion and emotion.  Cernuda wonders whether Alberti's recognition of the social injustice of Spain was the inspiration for him to write political poetry or whether his assumption of Communist beliefs forced him to reject personal values.<ref name=\"Cernuda223\">Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Rafael Alberti p 223</ref>\n\n===Altolaguirre and his family===\n\nThat there was a close bond between Altolaguirre, his wife Concha M\u00e9ndez, and Cernuda seems clear.  Cernuda devoted separate chapters in both ''Estudios sobre poes\u00eda espa\u00f1ola contempor\u00e1nea'' and ''Poes\u00eda y literatura'' to the poetry of Altolaguirre, consistently asserting that he was not a minor poet, despite the critical consensus to that effect.  In ''Desolaci\u00f3n de la Quimera'', he defends his dead friend from superficial, mistaken memories of \"Manolito\" the endearing man, held by people who have forgotten or never knew his rare gifts as a poet, in \"Supervivencias tribales en el medio literario\".<ref name=\"Villena introduction50\" />   It is like an echo of his fears for what will happen to his own reputation after death - will people remember him or turn to the legends promulgated by people like Salinas.\n\nWhen Altolaguirre and Concha married in June 1932, Cernuda was one of the witnesses at their wedding, along with Lorca, Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez, and Guill\u00e9n.<ref name=Islasintro14>Altolaguirre intro to Las Islas invitadas p 14</ref>  When in March 1933 their first child died in childbirth, Cernuda dedicated a poem to him - \"XIV\" in ''Donde habite el olvido''.<ref name=Islasintro15>Altolaguirre intro to Las Islas invitadas p 15</ref>  They lived in the same building in Madrid from 1935 to 1936 and, in Mexico, he lived in Concha's house.  At times, it seems that this was his real family.  In ''Desolaci\u00f3n de la Quimera'', there are two poems that suggest this.  \"Animula, vagula, blandula\" is a tender poem about watching Altolaguirre's five-year-old grandson, whom he nicknamed [[Entelechy]], playing in the garden and wondering how his fate will differ from his own.  \"Hablando a Manona\" is like a nursery rhyme addressed to their granddaughter.<ref name=\"Villena200\">Villena notes to Desolaci\u00f3n de la quimera p 200</ref>\n\n===Generation of 1898===\n\nCernuda's best critical writing tends to be about writers who interested and inspired him.  His writing about the Generation of 1898 is objective but nevertheless lacking in sympathy for the most part.  For example, he regards Valle-Incl\u00e1n as a playwright rather than the novelist, poet and general literary artist that history remembers him as.<ref name=Cernuda2191>Cernuda OCP vol 2 Teatro espa\u00f1ol contempor\u00e1neo p 191</ref>  Cernuda does not seem to have very much respect for the great figures of this generation, unlike most of his own generation.  Regarding Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez and Valle-Incl\u00e1n, he recalled that they were so intent on their own speech that they neglected to listen to other people.  And even in respect of Antonio Machado, so revered by for example Alberti,<ref name=Alberti216>Alberti p 216</ref>  he recalled that he spoke little and listened to even less.<ref name=Cernuda2156>Cernuda OCP vol 2 Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez 1941 p 156</ref>  In contrast to most Spanish thinkers, he respected [[Unamuno]] more as a poet than as a philosopher.<ref name=Cernuda128>Cernuda OCP vol 1 Miguel de Unamuno p 128</ref>  For Ortega y Gasset, he had little positive to say:  scattered all through Cernuda's critical writings are remarks such as ''[he] always understood very little when it came to poetry''<ref name=Cernuda126>Cernuda OCP vol 1 Miguel de Unamuno p 126</ref> and ''with his strange ignorance of poetic matters''.<ref name=Cernuda175>Cernuda OCP vol 1 G\u00f3mez de la Serna p 175</ref>  The member of that generation who had most impact on him is Jim\u00e9nez, although when he went to Britain one of the very few books that he took with him was [[Gerardo Diego]]'s anthology ''Poes\u00eda espa\u00f1ola'' and he found solace for his nostalgia for Spain in reading the selection of poems by Unamuno and Machado contained within.<ref name=\"Cernuda645\"/>  It is also true that in his study of Unamuno, he makes a comment that seems to relate directly to his own practice as a writer, his preoccupation with creating and perpetuating himself in his poetry, transforming the circumstances of his life into myth:<ref name=\"Poesia completa48\">Derek Harris: Introduction to Poes\u00eda completa p 48</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Alive and striving beyond what was only current circumstances, moments that pass and do not remain, Unamuno was hoping to create himself, or at least create his personal myth, and to be forever what was passing.<ref name=Cernuda129>Cernuda OCP vol 1 Miguel de Unamuno p 129</ref></blockquote>\n\nHe first met Jim\u00e9nez in late September-early October 1925 in Seville.  The meeting had been arranged by Pedro Salinas and he suggested to Cernuda that he should ask one of his friends, whose father was a warden of the Alc\u00e1zar, for permission to visit the gardens, out of hours.<ref name=Cernuda733>Cernuda OCP vol 1 PyL II Los Dos Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez p 733</ref>  Cernuda's account is interesting.  He was overawed by being in the presence of such an important figure.  In addition, there was the presence of Jim\u00e9nez's wife - [[Zenobia Camprub\u00ed]] - which also put him at a disadvantage, both because of his shyness and a lack of interest in women, although he had not yet realised why women did not interest him.<ref name=Cernuda734>Cernuda OCP vol 1 PyL II Los Dos Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez p 734</ref>  He placed himself in the role of a disciple, just listening to the Master.  He records how gracious Jim\u00e9nez was to him that evening and on subsequent meetings.  At that time, he was something of a hero to Cernuda and he notes how much effort it cost him to free himself from Jim\u00e9nez's type of personal, subjective poetry with no connection to the world and life, so influential as it was in Spanish cultural circles at that time.<ref name=Cernuda734/>\n\nIn this essay, he analyses the Jekyll and Hyde personality of Jim\u00e9nez.  On the one hand he was a famous poet, worthy of admiration and respect.  On the other hand, he was the man who launched abusive attacks on numerous literary figures.  This latter side gradually became more and more dominant.<ref name=Cernuda731>Cernuda OCP vol 1 PyL II Los Dos Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez p 731</ref>  In particular he took against the poets of Cernuda's own generation, at first confining his attacks to verbal ones but then turning to print.  He continued to print vilifications right to the end of his life, which had the effect of turning Cernuda's former admiration into indifference or even worse.<ref name=Cernuda733/>\n\nCernuda wrote many pieces about Jim\u00e9nez, including 2 satirical poems included in ''Desolaci\u00f3n de la Quimera''.  The early influence was decisively rejected and his essays identify all the stylistic elements that he cast off, such as the impressionistic symbolism,<ref name=\"Harris A Study5\">Harris A Study of the Poetry p5</ref> hermeticism,<ref name=Cernuda149>Cernuda OCP vol 1 Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez p 149</ref> the fragmentation of his poems,<ref name=Cernuda147>Cernuda OCP vol 1 Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez p 147</ref> his inability to sustain a thought,<ref name=Cernuda149/> the lack of desire to go beyond the surface of things.<ref name=Cernuda143>Cernuda OCP vol 1 Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez p 143</ref>\n\n==Gide, the dandy and homosexuality==\n\nHis sexual awakening seems to have coincided with the birth of his desire to write poetry, around the age of 14,<ref name=\"Cernuda626\"/> but it was many years later before he really came to terms with this side of himself.  A very important influence on his emotional development was the writings of Andr\u00e9 Gide.  In his essay of 1946, he writes: \"the transcendent figure for Gide is not that of a man who by means of abstention and denial searches for the divine, but that of a man who seeks out the fullness of humanity by means of effort and individual exaltation.\"<ref name=Cernuda549>Cernuda OCP vol 1 PyL I Andr\u00e9 Gide p 549</ref> In other words, he was affected by the idea of total [[hedonism]] without any sense of guilt.<ref name=\"Poesia completa52\">Harris intro to Poes\u00eda completa p 52</ref>\n\nAs seen in his accounts of his first meetings with Jim\u00e9nez in 1925 and Lorca in 1927, he had not really come to terms with his sexuality.  This only seems to happen once he finally left Seville in 1928, after his mother's death. He had already become noted as something of a dandy during his time at the University of Seville, as noted by Salinas - \"a well-cut suit, a perfectly-knotted tie\".<ref name=\"Villena introduction12\">Villena intro to edition of Las Nubes p 12</ref> This tendency seems to have intensified during his brief stay in Madrid before going to Toulouse - the pose of a man who frequents bars, drinks cocktails, affects English shirts, discussed in an article by Villena (''La rebeld\u00eda del dandy en Luis Cernuda'').<ref name=\"Villena introduction16\">Villena intro to edition of Las Nubes p 16</ref>  Villena diagnoses it as the sign of a refined hermit trying to hide his hyper-sensitivity and repressed desire for love. In Toulouse, he wrote to a friend that he was starting to think that he was too well-dressed.<ref name=\"Villena introduction17\">Villena intro to edition of Las Nubes p 17</ref>  Alone, in a foreign country, and still not at ease in his skin, he was taking refuge in dazzling the provincial bourgeoisie - thumbing his nose at them by wearing an immaculate three-piece suit.<ref name=\"Villena introduction17\"/> In some way, however, the combination of his contact with the world, the attitudes and thinking of the surrealists, the influence of Gide, and his pent-up fight against bourgeois tendencies coincided in the belated acceptance of his sexuality, as expressed finally in ''Un r\u00edo, un amor''.<ref name=\"Poesia completa53\">Harris intro to Poes\u00eda completa p 53</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n\nCernuda's work was known to the poets who grew up in Spain after the Civil War.  Of these, clear signs of influence can be seen in [[Jaime Gil de Biedma]], Jos\u00e9 Valente and Francisco Brines.<ref name=\"Villena introduction56\">Villena intro to Las Nubes etc p 56</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book|last=Harris|first=Derek|title=Luis Cernuda: A study of the Poetry|year=1973|publisher=Tamesis Books Ltd|location=London|isbn=0-900411-70-8|page=188}}\n*{{cite book|last=Alberti|first=Rafael|title=The Lost Grove (trans Gabriel Berns)|year=1976|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles|isbn=0-520-02786-8|page=323}}\n*{{cite book|last=Connell|first=Geoffrey|title=Spanish Poetry of the Grupo poetico de 1927|year=1977|publisher=Pergamon Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-08-016950-3|page=214}}\n*{{cite book|last=Morris|first=C|title=A Generation of Spanish Poets|isbn=0521294819|date=February 22, 1979|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/generationofspan0000morr_i3c2}}\n*{{cite book|last=Gibson|first=Ian|title=Federico Garcia Lorca|year=1989|publisher=Faber and Faber|location=London|isbn=0-571-14224-9|page=551}}\n*{{cite book|last=Guillen|first=Jorge|title=Language and Poetry|year=1961|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.| id =60-15889|page=293}}(Library of Congress Catalog Card Number)\n*{{cite book|last=P\u00e9rez Firmat|first=Gustavo|title=Tongue Ties: Logo-Eroticism in Anglo-Hispanic Literature|year=2003|publisher=Palgrave}}\n*{{cite book|last=Cernuda|first=Luis|title=Obra completa Prosa 2 vols|year=1994|publisher=Ediciones Siruela|location=Madrid|editor=Derek Harris and Luis Maristany}}\n*{{cite book|editor = Luis Antonio de Villena|last=Cernuda|first=Luis|title=Las Nubes; Desolacion de la Quimera|year=1984|publisher=Ediciones Catedra|location=Madrid|isbn=84-376-0480-X|page=213}}\n*{{cite book|last=Cernuda|first=Luis|title=Un rio, un amor and Los placeres prohibidos|year=1999|publisher=Ediciones Catedra|location=Madrid|isbn=84-376-1750-2|page=173|editor=Derek Harris}}\n*{{cite web|last=Valender|first=James|title=Stanley Richardson and Spain|url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/spanish/idealist/pages/page954.shtml|publisher=Revista Canaria de Estudios Ingleses (Tenerife), 7, pp. 61-72.|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130419152034/http://www.abdn.ac.uk/spanish/idealist/pages/page954.shtml|archivedate=April 19, 2013}}\n*{{cite journal|last=Murphy|first=Martin|title=Pub Poets|journal=Times Literary Supplement |date=April 26, 2013|page=14}}\n*{{cite book|last=Cernuda|first=Luis|title=Poesia completa|year=1993|publisher=Ediciones Siruela|location=Madrid|page=863|editor=Derek Harris and Luis Maristany}}\n*{{cite book|last=Cernuda|first=Luis|title=Selected Poems of Luis Cernuda (Bilingual Edition)|year=1999|publisher=The Sheep Meadow Press|location=Riverdale-on-Hudson|isbn=1-878818-80-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/selectedpoemsofl00cern/page/185 185]|editor=Reginald Gibbons|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/selectedpoemsofl00cern/page/185}}\n*{{cite book|last=Altolaguirre|first=Manuel|title=Las Islas invitadas|year=1972|publisher=Editorial Castalia|location=Madrid|isbn=84-7039-160-7|page=162|editor=Margarita Smerdou Altolaguirre}}\n*{{cite book|title=Studies in Modern Spanish Literature and Art presented to Helen F.

In twenty-one days a bumpy route had been established over the slide.<ref>http://www.archivos.ca/?p=130</ref>\n\n==Cause==\nThe landslide was caused by the presence of pre-existing tectonic structures (faults and shear zones) within the southwestern slope of Johnson Ridge.<ref>Brideau, M-A., Stead, D., Kinakin, D. and Fecova, K. 2005. The influence of tectonic structures on the Hope slide, British Columbia, Canada.

Changes in groundwater condition, often a trigger for landslides, is not thought to have played a role in the Hope Slide as the slide occurred during a protracted period of sub-zero temperatures in the winter, though some have suggested that freezing of seepage exit points may have caused an increase in water pressure at the toe of the slide.<ref>Brideau, M.A. Stead, D, Kinakin, D, and Fecova, K. 2005.

Most of the massive scar on the mountain face remains bare rock, without significant growth of trees or other large vegetation. It is quite easily visible from aircraft passing overhead.\n\nA view point on Highway 3 allows tourists to view the scar.\n\nA four kilometre stretch of the prior routing lies disused to the north of the new highway alignment.\n\n==Aircraft==\nOn August 13, 1965, an aircraft piloted by S.W.K.

It was the only RCAF Albatross loss.  Five of the six crew members died (Squadron Leader James L. Braiden (passenger), Flying Officer Christopher J. Cormier (radio operator), Leading Aircraftsman Robert E. MacNaughton (crewman), Flight Lieutenant Phillip L. Montgomery (co-pilot), and Flight Lieutenant Peter Semak (pilot)).

The volume of rock involved in the landslide has been estimated at 47 million cubic metres.<ref>Mathews WH, McTaggart KC (1969) The Hope Landslide, British Columbia.

The slide that obliterated the mountain's southwestern slope was discovered when  members of the [[RCMP]] detachment at Hope were dispatched to what were second reported as a couple of small rock slides. The first news reports of the slide were from [[CKSR-FM|CHWK Radio]] in [[Chilliwack]] where morning news reporter Gerald Pash and later news director Edgar Wilson filed voice reports with [[Canadian Press Cable Service|Broadcast News]] and [[The Canadian Press]].  \n\nThe slide completely displaced the ice and mud in [[Outram Lake]]<ref>http://www.riverwind.ca/Hopemap/SunshineValley/SunshineValley.html</ref> below with incredible force, throwing it against the opposite side of the valley, wiping all vegetation and trees down to the bare rock, then splashed back up the original, now bare, slope before settling. Recent research<ref>[http://bssaonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/84/5/1523 Seismic signatures of landslides: The 1990 Brenda Mine collapse and the 1965 hope rockslides - Weichert et al. 84 (5): 1523 - Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> shows that these impacts against the opposite valley sides produced the seismic signatures interpreted as earthquakes.\n\nThe slide buried a 1959 yellow [[Chevrolet]] convertible<ref>http://www.archivos.ca/?p=130</ref> that had become stuck in the first slide, an Arrow Transfer oil tanker truck, and a loaded hay truck that had stopped behind the tanker<ref>https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dDhgAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5G8NAAAAIBAJ&pg=7236%2C1251489\n</ref> under a torrent of 47 million cubic metres of pulverized rock, mud, and debris {{Convert|152.4|m}} deep and {{Convert|2|km}} wide, which came down the {{Convert|1220|m |adj=on }} mountainside.<ref>https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dDhgAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5G8NAAAAIBAJ&pg=6129%2C1227612</ref>\n\nNorman Stephanishin, the Arrow truck driver, had stopped behind the stuck convertible. Stephanishin, unable to turn his rig around on the narrow and icy road, tried to talk the four others into walking the five kilometres back to Sumallo Lodge. Unable to convince them, Stephanishin walked east to Sumallo Lodge to phone the [[British Columbia Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure|British Columbia Department of Highways]].<ref>https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dDhgAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5G8NAAAAIBAJ&pg=6129%2C1227612</ref> In a short distance, Stephanishin flagged down a [[Greyhound Lines]] bus traveling to Vancouver<ref>https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dDhgAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5G8NAAAAIBAJ&pg=7236%2C1251489</ref> and persuaded the driver, David Hughes, to return with him to Sumallo Lodge. Hughes turned back and is credited with saving his passengers from a tragedy.<ref>https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dDhgAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5G8NAAAAIBAJ&pg=4692%2C1227317</ref>\n\nRescue workers from Hope and Princeton found the body of Thomas Starchuck, 39, of [[Aldergrove, British Columbia|Aldergrove]], driver of the hay truck. The body of Bernie Lloyd Beck, 27, of [[Penticton]], driver of the convertible was also retrieved. Beck's passengers, Dennis George Arlitt, 23, of Penticton, and Mary Kalmakoff, 21, of Shoreacres, were never recovered. Their bodies remain entombed under the rock.<ref>http://www.hankstruckpictures.com/pix/trucks/bc_line_drivers/2016/12-30/greyhound/hope-slide00.pdf</ref>\n\nBritish Columbia Highways President [[Josh Gaglardi]] attended the scene and directed the construction of a temporary tote road over the southern portion of the slide. In twenty-one days a bumpy route had been established over the slide.<ref>http://www.archivos.ca/?p=130</ref>\n\n==Cause==\nThe landslide was caused by the presence of pre-existing tectonic structures (faults and shear zones) within the southwestern slope of Johnson Ridge.<ref>Brideau, M-A., Stead, D., Kinakin, D. and Fecova, K. 2005. The influence of tectonic structures on the Hope slide, British Columbia, Canada. Engineering Geology:80:242-259</ref> The lower parts of the slide scar are underlain by [[felsite]] sheets (which may have failed first) while the upper parts of the slide scar are underlain by highly jointed Paleozoic greenstone beds.<ref>Bruce, I., Cruden, D.M., 1977. The dynamics of the Hope Slide. Bulletin of the International Association of Engineering Geology 16, 94\u2013 98</ref> Ongoing weathering and tectonic activity weakened the slide mass to the point where it had reached limiting equilibrium. Johnson Peak was the site of a previous smaller prehistoric rock-slide.<ref>Dawson, G.M. 1879. Report on exploration in the southern portion of British Columbia; Geological Survey of Canada, Report of Progress, 1877-1878, Part B. pp. 1-173.</ref>\n\nJust what triggered the 1965 landslide remains unclear; the two so-called earthquakes were likely too small to trigger the slide<ref>Wetmiller, R.J. and Evans, S.G. 1989. Analysis of the earthquakes associated with the 1965 Hope landslide and their effects on slope stability at the site. Canadian Geotechnical Journal, 26, 484-490.</ref> and thus the seismic events were more likely caused by the impact of the landslide masses on the opposite valley wall. Changes in groundwater condition, often a trigger for landslides, is not thought to have played a role in the Hope Slide as the slide occurred during a protracted period of sub-zero temperatures in the winter, though some have suggested that freezing of seepage exit points may have caused an increase in water pressure at the toe of the slide.<ref>Brideau, M.A. Stead, D, Kinakin, D, and Fecova, K. 2005. Engineering Geology 80, 245-259.</ref>\n\n==Result==\n{{unsourced section|date=July 2011}}\n\n\nThe highway has since been rerouted around and over the base of the slide's debris field 55 metres above the original ground level on the other side of valley. Most of the massive scar on the mountain face remains bare rock, without significant growth of trees or other large vegetation. It is quite easily visible from aircraft passing overhead.\n\nA view point on Highway 3 allows tourists to view the scar.\n\nA four kilometre stretch of the prior routing lies disused to the north of the new highway alignment.\n\n==Aircraft==\nOn August 13, 1965, an aircraft piloted by S.W.K. Stevenson crashed, killing him.\n\nOn April 23, 1966, a [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] [[Grumman HU-16 Albatross|Grumman CSR-110 Albatross]] (9302) serving with No. 121 Composite Unit (KU) at RCAF Station Comox, BC crashed on the Hope Slide.  It was the only RCAF Albatross loss.  Five of the six crew members died (Squadron Leader James L. Braiden (passenger), Flying Officer Christopher J. Cormier (radio operator), Leading Aircraftsman Robert E. MacNaughton (crewman), Flight Lieutenant Phillip L. Montgomery (co-pilot), and Flight Lieutenant Peter Semak (pilot)). Flying Officer Bob Reid (navigator) was the sole survivor.  A portion of the wreckage is still visible and can be hiked to.\n\n==Climate==\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Hope Slide\n|metric first = Y\n|single line = Y\n|Jan maximum humidex = 9.2\n|Feb maximum
