Others are [[shrub]]s less than 10&nbsp;meters tall with a number of small [[trunk (botany)|trunks]] originating at ground level. Most species are [[deciduous]], and many are renowned for their [[autumn leaf colour]], but a few in southern Asia and the [[Mediterranean region]] are [[evergreen]]. Most are [[Shade tolerance|shade-tolerant]] when young and are often riparian, understory, or pioneer species rather than climax overstory trees. There are a few exceptions such as [[sugar maple]]. Many of the [[root]] systems are typically dense and fibrous, inhibiting the growth of other vegetation underneath them. A few species, notably ''[[Acer cappadocicum]]'', frequently produce [[root sprout]]s, which can develop into [[clonal colony|clonal colonies]].<ref name=\"gelderen\"/>\n\n[[File:Vine Maple leaves and flowers.jpg|thumb|''[[Acer circinatum]]'' (Vine maple) leaves showing the palmate veining typical of most species]]\nMaples are distinguished by opposite [[leaf]] arrangement. The leaves in most species are [[leaf shape|palmate]] veined and lobed, with 3 to 9 (rarely to 13) veins each leading to a lobe, one of which is central or apical. A small number of species differ in having palmate compound, [[leaf shape|pinnate]] compound, pinnate veined or unlobed leaves. Several species, including ''[[Acer griseum]]'' (paperbark maple), ''[[Acer mandshuricum]]'' (Manchurian maple), ''[[Acer maximowiczianum]]'' (Nikko maple) and ''[[Acer triflorum]]'' (three-flowered maple), have trifoliate leaves. One species, ''[[Acer negundo]]'' (box-elder), has pinnately compound leaves that may be simply trifoliate or may have five, seven, or rarely nine leaflets. A few, such as ''[[Acer laevigatum]]'' (Nepal maple) and ''[[Acer carpinifolium]]'' (hornbeam maple), have pinnately veined simple leaves.\n\n[[File:Maple7951.JPG|left|thumb|''[[Acer rubrum]]'' (red maple) flowers]]\nMaple species, such as ''[[Acer rubrum]]'', may be [[monoecious]], [[dioecious]] or [[polygamodioecious]]. The [[flower]]s are regular, [[symmetry (biology)#Pentamerism|pentamerous]], and borne in [[raceme]]s, [[corymb]]s, or [[umbels]]. They have four or five [[sepal]]s, four or five [[petal]]s about 1 \u2013 6&nbsp;mm long (absent in some species), four to ten [[stamen]]s about 6 \u2013 10&nbsp;mm long, and two [[pistil]]s or a pistil with two styles. The [[ovary (plants)|ovary]] is superior and has two [[carpel]]s, whose wings elongate the flowers, making it easy to tell which flowers are female. Maples flower in late [[winter]] or early [[spring (season)|spring]], in most species with or just after the appearance of the leaves, but in some before the trees leaf out.<ref name=rhs>Huxley, A., ed. (1992). ''New RHS Dictionary of Gardening''. Macmillan {{ISBN|0-333-47494-5}}.</ref>\n\nMaple flowers are green, yellow, orange or red.  Though individually small, the effect of an entire tree in flower can be striking in several species. Some maples are an early spring source of [[pollen]] and [[nectar (plant)|nectar]] for [[bee]]s.\n\n[[File:3D rendering of a \u00b5CT scan of a maple seed.ogv|thumb|right|[[3D rendering]] of a [[Computed tomography|\u00b5CT]] scan of a samara. Resolution is about 45 \u00b5m/[[voxel]].]]\nThe distinctive [[fruit]]s are called [[samara (fruit)|samaras]], \"maple keys\", \"helicopters\", \"whirlybirds\" or \"polynoses\". These [[seed]]s occur in distinctive pairs each containing one seed enclosed in a \"nutlet\" attached to a flattened wing of fibrous, papery tissue. They are shaped to spin as they fall and to carry the seeds a considerable distance on the wind. People often call them \"helicopters\" due to the way that they spin as they fall. During World War II, the US Army developed a special air drop supply carrier that could carry up to {{convert|65|lb}} of supplies and was based on the Maple seed.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=gN8DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA75&dq=Popular+Mechanics+Science+installing+linoleum&source=bl&ots=yzQ02csqDv&sig=Lse7JfsqahGNEIJnDq37RIszV2g&hl=en&sa=X&ei=6r4DUJ-YIIb2rAHXu-SyDA&sqi=2&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=true \"Sky Hook Spirals from Plane\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', December 1944, p. 75.</ref> Seed maturation is usually in a few weeks to six months after flowering, with [[Biological dispersal|seed dispersal]] shortly after maturity. However, one tree can release hundreds of thousands of seeds at a time. Depending on the species, the seeds can be small and green to orange and big with thicker seed pods. The green seeds are released in pairs, sometimes with the stems still connected. The yellow seeds are released individually and almost always without the stems. Most species require [[stratification (botany)|stratification]] in order to [[germination|germinate]], and some seeds can remain dormant in the soil for several years before germinating.<ref name=\"gelderen\"/>\n\nThe genus ''Acer'' together with genus ''[[Dipteronia]]'' are either classified in a [[Family (biology)|family]] of their own, the ''[[Aceraceae]]'', or else classified as members of the family ''[[Sapindaceae]]''. Recent classifications, including the [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Group]] system, favour inclusion in ''Sapindaceae''.

Sugar maple wood\u2014often known as \"hard maple\"\u2014is the wood of choice for [[bowling]] pins, bowling alley lanes, pool [[Cue stick|cue shafts]], and [[butcher block|butcher's blocks]]. Maple wood is also used for the manufacture of wooden [[baseball bat]]s, though less often than [[ash (tree)|ash]] or [[hickory]] due to the tendency of maple bats to shatter if they do break.  The maple bat was introduced to Major League Baseball (MLB) in 1998 by [[Sam Bat]] founder Sam Holman. Today it is the standard maple bat most in use by professional baseball.<ref>[http://www.hitrunscore.com/sam-bat-maple-baseball-bat-biography.html Sam Holman Maple Baseball Bats] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516023403/http://www.hitrunscore.com/sam-bat-maple-baseball-bat-biography.html |date=2010-05-16 }}</ref> Maple is also commonly used in archery as the core material in the limbs of a [[recurve bow]] due to its stiffness and strength.\n\nMaple wood is often graded based on physical and aesthetic characteristics. The most common terminology includes the grading scale from common #2; which is unselected and often used for craft woods; common #1, used for commercial and residential buildings; clear; and select grade, which is sought for fine woodworking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ahec.org/hardwoods/pdfs/IllustratedGradingGuide.pdf|title=Publications|website=Ahec.org|accessdate=19 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nSome maple wood has a highly decorative [[wood grain]], known as [[flame maple]], [[quilt maple]], [[birdseye maple]] and [[burl|burl wood]]. This condition occurs randomly in individual trees of several species, and often cannot be detected until the wood has been sawn, though it is sometimes visible in the standing tree as a rippled pattern in the bark.\n\nThese select decorative wood pieces also have subcategories that further filter the aesthetic looks. Crotch Wood, Bees Wing, Cats Paw, Old Growth and Mottled are some terms used to describe the look of these decorative woods.<ref>[http://www.hobbithouseinc.com/personal/woodpics/_figure.htm Wood Terms and Examples] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314144353/http://www.hobbithouseinc.com/personal/woodpics/_figure.htm |date=2010-03-14 }}</ref>\n\nMaples have a long history of use for furniture production in the United States.<ref name=\"Aronson1965\">{{cite book|author=Joseph Aronson|title=The encyclopedia of furniture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j3XWBk-qMV0C&pg=PT300|accessdate=8 September 2010|year=1965|publisher=Random House, Inc.|isbn=978-0-517-03735-5|pages=300\u2013}}</ref>\n\n====Tonewood====\nMaple is considered a [[tonewood]], or a wood that carries sound waves well, and is used in numerous [[musical instrument]]s.  Maple is harder and has a brighter sound than [[mahogany]], which is another major tonewood used in instrument manufacture.<ref>[http://www.fender.com/en-GB/news/index.php/?display_article=395] {{dead link|date=November 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe back, sides, and neck of most [[violins]], [[violas]], [[cellos]], and [[double bass]]es are made from maple.\n\n[[Electric guitar]] necks are commonly made from maple, having good dimensional stability.  The necks of the Fender [[Stratocaster]] and [[Telecaster]] were originally an entirely maple one piece neck, but later were also available with [[rosewood]] fingerboards. [[Les Paul]] desired an all maple guitar, but due to the weight of maple, only the tops of [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]]'s Les Paul guitars are made from carved maple, often using quilted or flamed maple tops. Due to its weight, very few [[solid body]] guitars are made entirely from maple, but many guitars have maple necks, tops or veneers.\n\nMaple is also often used to make [[bassoon]]s and sometimes for other [[woodwind instrument]]s like maple recorders.\n\nMany [[drum]]s are made from maple.  From the 70s to the 90s, maple drum kits were a vast majority of all drum kits made, but in recent years, [[birch]] has become popular for drums once again. Some of the best drum-building companies use maple extensively throughout their mid-pro range.<ref name=\"gelderen\"/>  Maple drums are favored for their bright resonant sound.<ref name=\"NichollsBacon1997\">{{cite book|author1=Geoff Nicholls|author2=Tony Bacon|title=The drum book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rWq1_qnZ0mAC&pg=PT54|accessdate=19 October 2010|date=1 June 1997|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|isbn=978-0-87930-476-8|pages=54\u2013}}</ref> Certain types of drum sticks are also made from maple.\n\n====Agriculture====\nAs they are a major source of [[pollen]] in early spring before many other plants have flowered, maples are important to the survival of [[honeybee]]s that play a commercially important role later in the spring and summer.\n\n====Pulpwood====\nMaple is used as [[pulpwood]]. The fibers have relatively thick walls that prevent collapsing upon drying. This gives good bulk and opacity in [[paper]]. Maple also gives paper good printing properties.\n\n===Tourism===\nMany maples have bright [[autumn foliage]], and many countries have leaf-watching traditions. The sugar maple ''([[Acer saccharum]])'' is the primary contributor to fall \"[[leaf peeping|foliage season]]\" in [[North America]], particularly in [[Central Ontario]], [[Qu\u00e9bec]], and northern [[New England]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Wisconsin]], and [[Michigan]].\n\nIn [[Japan]], the custom of viewing the changing colour of maples in the autumn is called [[Leaf peeping|''momijigari'']]. [[Nikko, Tochigi|Nikko]] and [[Kyoto]] are particularly favoured destinations for this activity. In Korea, the same viewing activity is called ''danpung-nori'' and the [[Seoraksan]] and [[Naejang-san]] mountains are among the best-known destinations.\n\n===Gallery===\n<gallery>\nImage:Acer cappadocicum spring.jpg|''[[Acer cappadocicum]]'' (Cappadocian maple)\nImage:Acer carpinifolium.jpg|''[[Acer carpinifolium]]'' leaves\nImage:Autumn Blaze Maple Foliage.jpg|''[[Acer \u00d7 freemanii]]'' 'Autumn Blaze' (a cross between ''[[Acer rubrum|A. rubrum]]'' and ''[[Acer saccharinum|A. saccharinum]]''\nImage:Acer macrophyllum 0304.jpg|''[[Acer macrophyllum]]'' flowers and young leaves\nImage:Acer laevigatum 3.jpg|''[[Acer laevigatum]]'' leaves and fruit\nImage:Acer sempervirens leaves.jpg|''[[Acer sempervirens]]'' foliage\nImage:Acer ginnala.jpg|''[[Acer ginnala]]'' foliage\n<!-- Deleted image removed: Image:redmaple.jpg|''[[Acer rubrum]]'' trees in autumn -->\nImage:TenryujiMomiji.jpg|''[[Acer palmatum]]'' trees and bamboo in Japan\nImage:Bi-colored Maple Tree.jpg|''[[Acer grandidentatum]]'' (Bigtooth Maple) in autumn colour\nImage:Maple leaf Fcb981.JPG|''[[Acer platanoides]]'' leaf\nImage:Red maple leaf.jpg|''[[Acer palmatum]]'' leaf in [[autumn]]\nImage:Helicopter leaves.jpg|''[[Acer platanoides]]'' (Norway maple) samaras\nImage:Paperbark Maple Acer griseum Leaves Closeup 2856px.jpg|''[[Acer griseum]]'' (Paperbark maple)\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Acer species]]\n* [[List of Award of Garden Merit maples]]\n* [[Mazer (drinking vessel)|Mazer]] \u2013 a drinking vessel made from maple wood\n* [[List of foods made from maple]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book|last=Philips|first=Roger|title=Trees of North America and Europe|publisher=Random House, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0-394-50259-0|year=1979|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/treesofnorthamer00phil}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Acer}}\n* {{cite web|last=Eichhorn|first=Markus|title=The Maple Tree|url=http://www.test-tube.org.uk/trees/video_maple.htm|work=Test Tube|publisher=[[Brady Haran]] for the [[University of Nottingham]]|date=November 2011}}\n\n{{Woodworking}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q42292}}\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Acer| ]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses}}\n{{External links|date=January 2019}}\n{{short description|genus of flowering plants, trees in the lychee family Sapindaceae}}\n{{automatic taxobox\n|fossil range= {{fossil range|Late Paleocene|Recent|earliest=66.5}}\n|image = Acer pseudoplatanus 002.jpg\n|image_caption = ''[[Acer pseudoplatanus]]'' (sycamore maple) foliage\n|taxon = Acer\n|authority = [[Carl Linnaeus|L.]]\n|range_map = Map genus Acer.png\n|range_map_caption = Distribution\n|subdivision_ranks = Species\n|subdivision = See either <br>[[List of Acer species|species grouped by sections]]<br>[[List of Acer species alphabetical|alphabetical list of species]]\n}}\n\n'''''Acer''''' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|e\u026a|s|\u0259r}} is a [[genus]] of trees and shrubs commonly known as '''maple'''.

Others are [[shrub]]s less than 10&nbsp;meters tall with a number of small [[trunk (botany)|trunks]] originating at ground level. Most species are [[deciduous]], and many are renowned for their [[autumn leaf colour]], but a few in southern Asia and the [[Mediterranean region]] are [[evergreen]]. Most are [[Shade tolerance|shade-tolerant]] when young and are often riparian, understory, or pioneer species rather than climax overstory trees. There are a few exceptions such as [[sugar maple]]. Many of the [[root]] systems are typically dense and fibrous, inhibiting the growth of other vegetation underneath them. A few species, notably ''[[Acer cappadocicum]]'', frequently produce [[root sprout]]s, which can develop into [[clonal colony|clonal colonies]].<ref name=\"gelderen\"/>\n\n[[File:Vine Maple leaves and flowers.jpg|thumb|''[[Acer circinatum]]'' (Vine maple) leaves showing the palmate veining typical of most species]]\nMaples are distinguished by opposite [[leaf]] arrangement. The leaves in most species are [[leaf shape|palmate]] veined and lobed, with 3 to 9 (rarely to 13) veins each leading to a lobe, one of which is central or apical. A small number of species differ in having palmate compound, [[leaf shape|pinnate]] compound, pinnate veined or unlobed leaves. Several species, including ''[[Acer griseum]]'' (paperbark maple), ''[[Acer mandshuricum]]'' (Manchurian maple), ''[[Acer maximowiczianum]]'' (Nikko maple) and ''[[Acer triflorum]]'' (three-flowered maple), have trifoliate leaves. One species, ''[[Acer negundo]]'' (box-elder), has pinnately compound leaves that may be simply trifoliate or may have five, seven, or rarely nine leaflets. A few, such as ''[[Acer laevigatum]]'' (Nepal maple) and ''[[Acer carpinifolium]]'' (hornbeam maple), have pinnately veined simple leaves.\n\n[[File:Maple7951.JPG|left|thumb|''[[Acer rubrum]]'' (red maple) flowers]]\nMaple species, such as ''[[Acer rubrum]]'', may be [[monoecious]], [[dioecious]] or [[polygamodioecious]]. The [[flower]]s are regular, [[symmetry (biology)#Pentamerism|pentamerous]], and borne in [[raceme]]s, [[corymb]]s, or [[umbels]]. They have four or five [[sepal]]s, four or five [[petal]]s about 1 \u2013 6&nbsp;mm long (absent in some species), four to ten [[stamen]]s about 6 \u2013 10&nbsp;mm long, and two [[pistil]]s or a pistil with two styles. The [[ovary (plants)|ovary]] is superior and has two [[carpel]]s, whose wings elongate the flowers, making it easy to tell which flowers are female. Maples flower in late [[winter]] or early [[spring (season)|spring]], in most species with or just after the appearance of the leaves, but in some before the trees leaf out.<ref name=rhs>Huxley, A., ed.

Sugar maple wood\u2014often known as \"hard maple\"\u2014is the wood of choice for [[bowling]] pins, bowling alley lanes, pool [[Cue stick|cue shafts]], and [[butcher block|butcher's blocks]]. Maple wood is also used for the manufacture of wooden [[baseball bat]]s, though less often than [[ash (tree)|ash]] or [[hickory]] due to the tendency of maple bats to shatter if they do break.  The maple bat was introduced to Major League Baseball (MLB) in 1998 by [[Sam Bat]] founder Sam Holman. Today it is the standard maple bat most in use by professional baseball.<ref>[http://www.hitrunscore.com/sam-bat-maple-baseball-bat-biography.html Sam Holman Maple Baseball Bats] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516023403/http://www.hitrunscore.com/sam-bat-maple-baseball-bat-biography.html |date=2010-05-16 }}</ref> Maple is also commonly used in archery as the core material in the limbs of a [[recurve bow]] due to its stiffness and strength.\n\nMaple wood is often graded based on physical and aesthetic characteristics. The most common terminology includes the grading scale from common #2; which is unselected and often used for craft woods; common #1, used for commercial and residential buildings; clear; and select grade, which is sought for fine woodworking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ahec.org/hardwoods/pdfs/IllustratedGradingGuide.pdf|title=Publications|website=Ahec.org|accessdate=19 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nSome maple wood has a highly decorative [[wood grain]], known as [[flame maple]], [[quilt maple]], [[birdseye maple]] and [[burl|burl wood]]. This condition occurs randomly in individual trees of several species, and often cannot be detected until the wood has been sawn, though it is sometimes visible in the standing tree as a rippled pattern in the bark.\n\nThese select decorative wood pieces also have subcategories that further filter the aesthetic looks. Crotch Wood, Bees Wing, Cats Paw, Old Growth and Mottled are some terms used to describe the look of these decorative woods.<ref>[http://www.hobbithouseinc.com/personal/woodpics/_figure.htm Wood Terms and Examples] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314144353/http://www.hobbithouseinc.com/personal/woodpics/_figure.htm |date=2010-03-14 }}</ref>\n\nMaples have a long history of use for furniture production in the United States.<ref name=\"Aronson1965\">{{cite book|author=Joseph Aronson|title=The encyclopedia of furniture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j3XWBk-qMV0C&pg=PT300|accessdate=8 September 2010|year=1965|publisher=Random House, Inc.|isbn=978-0-517-03735-5|pages=300\u2013}}</ref>\n\n====Tonewood====\nMaple is considered a [[tonewood]], or a wood that carries sound waves well, and is used in numerous [[musical instrument]]s.

The necks of the Fender [[Stratocaster]] and [[Telecaster]] were originally an entirely maple one piece neck, but later were also available with [[rosewood]] fingerboards. [[Les Paul]] desired an all maple guitar, but due to the weight of maple, only the tops of [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]]'s Les Paul guitars are made from carved maple, often using quilted or flamed maple tops. Due to its weight, very few [[solid body]] guitars are made entirely from maple, but many guitars have maple necks, tops or veneers.\n\nMaple is also often used to make [[bassoon]]s and sometimes for other [[woodwind instrument]]s like maple recorders.\n\nMany [[drum]]s are made from maple.  From the 70s to the 90s, maple drum kits were a vast majority of all drum kits made, but in recent years, [[birch]] has become popular for drums once again.

The fibers have relatively thick walls that prevent collapsing upon drying. This gives good bulk and opacity in [[paper]]. Maple also gives paper good printing properties.\n\n===Tourism===\nMany maples have bright [[autumn foliage]], and many countries have leaf-watching traditions. The sugar maple ''([[Acer saccharum]])'' is the primary contributor to fall \"[[leaf peeping|foliage season]]\" in [[North America]], particularly in [[Central Ontario]], [[Qu\u00e9bec]], and northern [[New England]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Wisconsin]], and [[Michigan]].\n\nIn [[Japan]], the custom of viewing the changing colour of maples in the autumn is called [[Leaf peeping|''momijigari'']]. [[Nikko, Tochigi|Nikko]] and [[Kyoto]] are particularly favoured destinations for this activity. In Korea, the same viewing activity is called ''danpung-nori'' and the [[Seoraksan]] and [[Naejang-san]] mountains are among the best-known destinations.\n\n===Gallery===\n<gallery>\nImage:Acer cappadocicum spring.jpg|''[[Acer cappadocicum]]'' (Cappadocian maple)\nImage:Acer carpinifolium.jpg|''[[Acer carpinifolium]]'' leaves\nImage:Autumn Blaze Maple Foliage.jpg|''[[Acer \u00d7 freemanii]]'' 'Autumn Blaze' (a cross between ''[[Acer rubrum|A. rubrum]]'' and ''[[Acer saccharinum|A. saccharinum]]''\nImage:Acer macrophyllum 0304.jpg|''[[Acer macrophyllum]]'' flowers and young leaves\nImage:Acer laevigatum 3.jpg|''[[Acer laevigatum]]'' leaves and fruit\nImage:Acer sempervirens leaves.jpg|''[[Acer sempervirens]]'' foliage\nImage:Acer ginnala.jpg|''[[Acer ginnala]]'' foliage\n<!-- Deleted image removed: Image:redmaple.jpg|''[[Acer rubrum]]'' trees in autumn -->\nImage:TenryujiMomiji.jpg|''[[Acer palmatum]]'' trees and bamboo in Japan\nImage:Bi-colored Maple Tree.jpg|''[[Acer grandidentatum]]'' (Bigtooth Maple) in autumn colour\nImage:Maple leaf Fcb981.JPG|''[[Acer platanoides]]'' leaf\nImage:Red maple leaf.jpg|''[[Acer palmatum]]'' leaf in [[autumn]]\nImage:Helicopter leaves.jpg|''[[Acer platanoides]]'' (Norway maple) samaras\nImage:Paperbark Maple Acer griseum Leaves Closeup 2856px.jpg|''[[Acer griseum]]'' (Paperbark maple)\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Acer species]]\n* [[List of Award of Garden Merit maples]]\n* [[Mazer (drinking vessel)|Mazer]] \u2013 a drinking vessel made from maple wood\n* [[List of foods made from maple]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book|last=Philips|first=Roger|title=Trees of North America and Europe|publisher=Random House, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0-394-50259-0|year=1979|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/treesofnorthamer00phil}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Acer}}\n* {{cite web|last=Eichhorn|first=Markus|title=The Maple Tree|url=http://www.test-tube.org.uk/trees/video_maple.htm|work=Test Tube|publisher=[[Brady Haran]] for the [[University of Nottingham]]|date=November 2011}}\n\n{{Woodworking}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q42292}}\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Acer| ]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n", "name_user": "Gorkel", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(words)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maple"}
