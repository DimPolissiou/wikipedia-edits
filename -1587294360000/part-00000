There are no standardised formats for these, except [[Kildare GAA|Kildare]] whose flag, like their kit, is all-white. Typically, flags are formed as vertical bicolours or tricolours, with the major colour nearest the hoist. Horizontal stripes are also found. This is common in [[County Offaly]], where vertical county colours might be mistaken for the [[flag of Ireland]]; however other Offaly fans deliberately exploit this double significance.

The desired result is a state of society where living conditions and resources are used to continue to meet human needs without undermining the integrity and stability of the natural system. Sustainable development can be defined as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs....\n \nWhile the modern concept of sustainable development is derived mostly from the 1987 [[Brundtland Commission|Brundtland Report]], it is also rooted in earlier ideas about [[sustainable forest management]] and twentieth-century environmental concerns. As the concept developed, it has shifted its focus more towards the [[economic development]], [[Social change|social development]] and environmental protection for future generations. It has been suggested that \"the term 'sustainability' should be viewed as humanity's target goal of human-ecosystem equilibrium, while 'sustainable development' refers to the [[Sustainable livelihood|holistic approach]] and temporal processes that lead us to the end point of sustainability\".<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Shaker |first=Richard Ross |date=September 2015 |title=The spatial distribution of development in Europe and its underlying sustainability correlations |journal=Applied Geography |volume=63 |pages=<!-- 304\u2013314 --> |at=p. 35 |doi=10.1016/j.apgeog.2015.07.009}}</ref> Modern economies are endeavoring to reconcile ambitious economic development and obligations of preserving [[natural resource]]s and [[Ecosystem services|ecosystems]], as the two are usually seen as of conflicting nature.

ESD aims to empower and equip current and future generations to meet the needs using a balanced and integrated approach to the [[Economy|economic]], [[social]] and [[Biophysical environment|environmental]] dimensions of sustainable development.<ref name=\"UNESCO\">{{Cite book|title=Issues and trends in education for sustainable development|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=978-92-3-100244-1|location=Paris|pages=7}}</ref>\n\n==== Concept ====\nThe concept of [[Monitoring Education for Sustainable Development|ESD]] was born from the need for [[education]] to address the growing and changing  environmental challenges facing the [[planet]]. In order to do this, [[education]] must change to provide the [[knowledge]], skills, values and attitudes that empower [[learner]]s to contribute to sustainable development. At the same time, [[education]] must be strengthened in all agendas, programmes, and activities that promote sustainable development. Sustainable development must be integrated into [[education]] and education must be integrated into sustainable development. ESD promotes the integration of these critical sustainability issues in local and global contexts into the [[curriculum]] to prepare [[Learning|learners]] to understand and respond to the changing world. ESD aims to produce [[Educational aims and objectives|learning outcomes]] that include core competencies such as critical and systematic [[Thought|thinking]], collaborative [[decision-making]], and taking responsibility for the present and [[future generation]]s. Since traditional single-directional delivery of [[knowledge]] is not sufficient to inspire learners to take action as [[Citizenship|responsible citizens]], ESD entails rethinking the [[Learning environment|learning environmen]]<nowiki/>t, physical and virtual. The learning environment itself must adapt and apply a whole-institution approach to embed the philosophy of sustainable development. Building the capacity of [[Education|educators]] and policy support at international, regional, national and local levels helps drive changes in [[learning institution]]s. Empowered youth and local communities interacting with education institutions become key actors in advancing sustainable development.<ref name=\"UNESCO\"/>\n\n==== UN Decade for Sustainable Development ====\nThe launch of the UN Decade of [[Education for sustainable development|Education for Sustainable Development]] (2005-2014) started a global movement to reorient education to address the challenges of sustainable development. Building on the achievement of the Decade, stated in the Aichi-Nagoya Declaration on ESD, [[UNESCO]] endorsed the Global Action Programme on ESD (GAP) in the 37th session of its General Conference. Acknowledged by [[UN general assembly|UN General Assembly]] Resolution A/RES/69/211 and launched at the UNESCO World Conference on ESD in 2014, the GAP aims to scale-up actions and good practices. UNESCO has a major role, along with its partners, in bringing about key achievements to ensure the principles of [[Education for sustainable development|ESD]] are promoted through formal, non-formal and [[informal education]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Issues and trends in education for sustainable development|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=978-92-3-100244-1|location=Paris|pages=8}}</ref>\n\nInternational recognition of ESD as the key enabler for sustainable development is growing steadily. The role of ESD was recognized in three major UN summits on sustainable development: the 1992 [[Earth Summit|UN Conference on Environment and Development]] (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro, [[Brazil]]; the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg, [[South Africa]]; and the 2012 [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development|UN Conference on Sustainable Development]] (UNCSD) in Rio de Janeiro. Other key global agreements such as the [[Paris Agreement]] (Article 12) also recognize the importance of ESD. Today, ESD is arguably at the heart of the [[Sustainable Development Goals|2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development]] and its 17 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs) (United Nations, 2015). The SDGs recognize that all countries must stimulate action in the following key areas - people, [[planet]], prosperity, [[peace]] and [[partnership]] - in order to tackle the global challenges that are crucial for the survival of [[human]]ity. ESD is explicitly mentioned in Target 4.7 of SDG4, which aims to ensure that all [[Learning|learners]] acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development and is understood as an important means to achieve all the other 16 SDGs (UNESCO, 2017).<ref name=\"UNESCO\"/>\n\n==Sub-groups==\n{{See also|Planetary boundaries|Triple bottom line}}\n{{Pillars of sustainability|Scheme of sustainable development: <br/ >at the confluence of three constituent parts.

This, for example, entails using water sustainably, utilizing renewable energy, and sustainable material supplies (e.g. harvesting wood from forests at a rate that maintains the biomass and biodiversity).{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nAn unsustainable situation occurs when [[natural capital]] (the sum total of nature's resources) is used up faster than it can be replenished. Sustainability requires that human activity only uses nature's resources at a rate at which they can be replenished naturally. Inherently the concept of sustainable development is intertwined with the concept of carrying capacity. Theoretically, the long-term result of [[environmental degradation]] is the inability to sustain human life.  Such degradation on a global scale should imply an increase in human death rate until population falls to what the degraded environment can support.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}  If the degradation continues beyond a certain [[Planetary boundaries|tipping point]] or critical threshold it would lead to eventual [[extinction]] for humanity.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

When the costs of polluting the commons are not calculated into the cost of the items consumed, then it becomes only natural to pollute, as the cost of pollution is external to the cost of the goods produced and the cost of cleaning the waste before it is discharged exceeds the cost of releasing the waste directly into the commons.  So, the only way to solve this problem is by protecting the ecology of the commons by making it, through taxes or fines, more costly to release the waste directly into the commons than would be the cost of cleaning the waste before discharge.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Economics, Ecology, Ethics: Essays toward a Steady-State Economy|last=Daly|first=H.

Once again, this issue needs to be addressed.  Because, left unaddressed, the development of the commonly owned property will become impossible to achieve in a sustainable way.  So, this topic is central to the understanding of creating a sustainable situation from the management of the public resources that are used for personal use.\n\n====Agriculture====\n{{See also|Sustainable agriculture}}\nSustainable agriculture consists of [[environment friendly]] methods of farming that allow the production of crops or livestock without damage to human or natural systems.

Therefore, solutions need to be found so that the economies of the world can continue to grow, but not at the expense of the public good.  In the world of economics the amount of environmental quality must be considered as limited in supply and therefore is treated as a scarce resource. This is a resource to be protected. One common way to analyze possible outcomes of policy decisions on the scarce resource is to do a cost-benefit analysis. This type of analysis contrasts different options of resource allocation and, based on an evaluation of the expected courses of action and the consequences of these actions, the optimal way to do so in the light of different policy goals can be elicited.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Barbier|first1=E.B.|last2=Markandya|first2=A.|last3=Pearce|first3=D.W.|title=Environmental sustainability and cost-benefit analysis|journal=Environment and Planning A|date=1990|volume=22|issue=9|doi=10.1068/a221259|pages=1259\u20131266|citeseerx=10.1.1.335.1749}}</ref>\n\nBenefit-cost analysis basically can look at several ways of solving a problem and then assigning the best route for a solution, based on the set of consequences that would result from the further development of the individual courses of action, and then choosing the course of action that results in the least amount of damage to the expected outcome for the environmental quality that remains after that development or process takes place. Further complicating this analysis are the interrelationships of the various parts of the environment that might be impacted by the chosen course of action.  Sometimes it is almost impossible to predict the various outcomes of a course of action, due to the unexpected consequences and the amount of unknowns that are not accounted for in the benefit-cost analysis.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n====Energy====\n{{Main|Smart grid|Sustainable energy}}\nSustainable energy is clean and can be used over a long period of time.

This [[eco-efficiency]] is usually calculated as the economic value added by a firm in relation to its aggregated ecological impact.<ref>Schaltegger, S. & Sturm, A. 1998. Eco-Efficiency by Eco-Controlling. Z\u00fcrich: vdf.</ref>  This idea has been popularised by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development ([[WBCSD]]) under the following definition: \"Eco-efficiency is achieved by the delivery of competitively priced goods and services that satisfy human needs and bring quality of life, while progressively reducing ecological impacts and [[resource intensity]] throughout the life-cycle to a level at least in line with the earth's carrying capacity\" (DeSimone and Popoff, 1997: 47).<ref>DeSimone, L. & Popoff, F. 1997. Eco-efficiency: The business link to sustainable development. Cambridge: MIT Press.</ref>\n\nSimilar to the eco-efficiency concept but so far less explored is the second criterion for corporate sustainability. Socio-efficiency<ref name=\"Dyllick, T. 2002\">{{cite journal | last1 = Dyllick | first1 = T. | last2 = Hockerts | first2 = K. | year = 2002 | title = Beyond the business case for corporate sustainability | url = | journal = Business Strategy and the Environment | volume = 11 | issue = 2| pages = 130\u2013141 | doi=10.1002/bse.323}}</ref> describes the relation between a firm's value added and its social impact. Whereas, it can be assumed that most corporate impacts on the environment are negative (apart from rare exceptions such as the planting of trees) this is not true for social impacts. These can be either positive (e.g. corporate giving, creation of employment) or negative (e.g. work accidents, mobbing of employees, human rights abuses). Depending on the type of impact socio-efficiency thus either tries to minimise negative social impacts (i.e. accidents per value added) or maximise positive social impacts (i.e. donations per value added) in relation to the value added.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nBoth eco-efficiency and socio-efficiency are concerned primarily with increasing economic sustainability. In this process they instrumentalise both natural and social capital aiming to benefit from win-win situations. However, as Dyllick and Hockerts<ref name=\"Dyllick, T. 2002\"/> point out the business case alone will not be sufficient to realise sustainable development. They point towards eco-effectiveness, socio-effectiveness, sufficiency, and eco-equity as four criteria that need to be met if sustainable development is to be reached.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=William|last2=Tilley|first2=Fiona|date=2006|title=Can businesses move beyond efficiency?

The political is defined as the domain of practices and meanings associated with basic issues of social power as they pertain to the organisation, authorisation, legitimation and regulation of a social life held in common. This definition is in accord with the view that political change is important for responding to economic, ecological and cultural challenges. It also means that the politics of economic change can be addressed.

In this context, the [[Agenda 21 for culture]] and the [[United Cities and Local Governments]] (UCLG)  Executive Bureau lead the preparation of the policy statement \"Culture: Fourth Pillar of Sustainable Development\", passed on 17 November 2010, in the framework of the World Summit of Local and Regional Leaders&nbsp;\u2013 3rd World Congress of UCLG, held in Mexico City.

This design incorporates some ecological, economic, and social elements. The goals presented by LEED design goals are sustainable sites, water efficiency, energy consumption and atmospheric emission reduction, material and resources efficiency, and indoor environmental quality. Although amount of structures for sustainability development is many, these qualification has become a standard for sustainable building.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nRecent research efforts created also the [[SDEWES Centre#SDEWES Index|SDEWES Index]] to benchmark the performance of cities across aspects that are related to energy, water and environment systems. The [[SDEWES Centre|SDEWES]] Index consists of 7 dimensions, 35 indicators, and close to 20 sub-indicators. It is currently applied to 58 cities.<ref>{{Cite web|title = SDEWES Centre - SDEWES Index|url = http://www.sdewes.org/sdewes_index.php|website = www.sdewes.org|accessdate = 2015-10-17}}</ref>\n\n===Natural capital===\n[[File:Hillside deforestation in Rio de Janeiro.jpg|thumb|alt=Deforastation of native rain forest in Rio de Janeiro City for extraction of clay for civil construction|[[Deforestation]] of native [[rain forest]] in Rio de Janeiro City for extraction of [[clay]] for [[civil engineering]] (2009 picture).]]\nThe sustainable development debate is based on the assumption that societies need to manage three types of capital (economic, social, and natural), which may be non-substitutable and whose consumption might be irreversible.<ref name=\"Dyllick, T. 2002\"/> Leading [[Ecological economics|ecological economist]] and [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state theorist]] [[Herman Daly]],<ref name=hd01/> for example, points to the fact that [[natural capital]] can not necessarily be substituted by economic capital. While it is possible that we can find ways to replace some natural resources, it is much more unlikely that they will ever be able to replace eco-system services, such as the protection provided by the ozone layer, or the climate stabilizing function of the Amazonian forest. In fact natural capital, social capital and economic capital are often complementarities. A further obstacle to substitutability lies also in the multi-functionality of many natural resources. Forests, for example, not only provide the raw material for paper (which can be substituted quite easily), but they also maintain biodiversity, regulate water flow, and absorb CO2.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nAnother problem of natural and social capital deterioration lies in their partial irreversibility. The [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]], for example, is often definitive. The same can be true for cultural diversity. For example, with globalisation advancing quickly the number of indigenous languages is dropping at alarming rates.  Moreover, the depletion of natural and social capital may have non-linear consequences. Consumption of natural and social capital may have no observable impact until a certain threshold is reached. A lake can, for example, absorb nutrients for a long time while actually increasing its productivity. However, once a certain level of algae is reached lack of oxygen causes the lake's ecosystem to break down suddenly.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fws.gov/nc-es/edout/albenutrient.html|title=Nutrients: Too Much of a Good Thing|last=Newcomb|first=Doug|date=|website=United States Fish and Wildlife Service|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012180755/http://www.fws.gov/nc-es/edout/albenutrient.html|archivedate=2006-10-12|accessdate=17 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Business-as-usual===\n[[File:Air pollution by industrial chimneys.jpg|thumb|Before [[flue-gas desulfurization]] was installed, the [[air pollution|air-polluting]] emissions from this power plant in [[New Mexico]] contained excessive amounts of [[sulfur dioxide]].]]\nIf the degradation of natural and social capital has such important consequence the question arises why action is not taken more systematically to alleviate it.

Second, natural capital is often undervalued by society since we are not fully aware of the real cost of the depletion of natural capital. Information asymmetry is a third reason\u2014often the link between cause and effect is obscured, making it difficult for actors to make informed choices. Cohen and Winn close with the realization that contrary to economic theory many firms are not perfect optimisers. They postulate that firms often do not optimise resource allocation because they are caught in a \"business as usual\" mentality.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n===Education===\n''Main page: [[Education for sustainable development]]''\n\nEducation must be revisited in light of a renewed vision of sustainable human and social development that is both equitable and viable. This vision of sustainability must take into consideration the social, environmental and economic dimensions of human development and the various ways in which these relate to education: 'An empowering education is one that builds the human resources we need to be productive, to continue to learn, to solve problems, to be creative, and to live together and with nature in peace and harmony. When nations ensure that such an education is accessible to all throughout their lives, a quiet revolution is set in motion: education becomes the engine of sustainable development and the key to a better world.'<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Power of Education: Education for All, Development, Globalisation and UNESCO|last=Power|first=C|publisher=London, Springer|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002325/232555e.pdf|title=Rethinking Education: Towards a global common good?|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100088-1|location=|pages=31\u201332}}</ref>\n\n== Insubstantial stretching of the term ==\n{{Criticism section|date=August 2019}}\n{{Essay|section|date=August 2019}}\n{{undue weight|section|date=August 2019}}\nIt has been argued that since the 1960s, the concept of sustainable development has changed from \"conservation management\" to \"economic development\", whereby the original meaning of the concept has been stretched somewhat.<ref name=to01/>{{rp|48\u201354}}\n\nIn the 1960s, the international community realised that many African countries needed national plans to safeguard wildlife habitats, and that rural areas had to confront the limits imposed by soil, climate and water availability. This was a strategy of conservation management. In the 1970s, however, the focus shifted to the broader issues of the provisioning of basic human needs, community participation as well as appropriate technology use throughout the developing countries (and not just in Africa). This was a strategy of economic development, and the strategy was carried even further by the [[Brundtland Commission]]'s report on ''[[Our Common Future]]'' when the issues went from regional to international in scope and application.<ref name=to01/>{{rp|48\u201354}} In effect, the conservationists were crowded out and superseded by the developers.\n\nBut shifting the focus of sustainable development from conservation to development has had the imperceptible effect of stretching the original forest management term of [[sustainable yield]] from the use of renewable resources only (like forestry), to now also accounting for the use of non-renewable resources (like [[Natural resource#Classification|minerals]]).<ref name=kt01/>{{rp|13}} This stretching of the term has been questioned. Thus, environmental economist Kerry Turner has argued that literally, there can be no such thing as overall \"sustainable development\" in an industrialised [[world economy]] that remains heavily dependent on the extraction of earth's finite stock of exhaustible mineral resources: \"It makes no sense to talk about the sustainable use of a non-renewable resource (even with substantial [[recycling]] effort and reduction in use rates). Any positive rate of exploitation will eventually lead to exhaustion of the finite stock.\"<ref name=kt01/>{{rp|13}}\n\nIn effect, it has been argued that the industrial revolution as a whole is unsustainable.<ref name=ngr01/>{{rp|20f}} <ref name=jr01/>{{rp|61\u201367}} <ref name=hd01/>{{rp|22f}} <ref>{{cite journal |last=Duncan |first=Richard C. |authorlink=Richard C.

After World War II, the notion of \"development\" had been established in the West to imply the projection of the American model of society onto the rest of the world. In the 1970s and 1980s, this notion was broadened somewhat to also imply human rights, basic human needs and finally, ecological issues. The emphasis of the report was on helping poor nations out of poverty and meeting the basic needs of their growing populations\u2014as usual. This issue demanded more economic growth, also in the rich countries, who would then import more goods from the poor countries to help them out\u2014as usual. When the discussion switched to [[Steady-state economy#Present background: Exceeding global limits to growth|global ecological limits to growth]], the obvious dilemma was left aside by calling for economic growth with improved resource efficiency, or what was termed \"a change in the ''quality'' of growth\". However, most countries in the West had experienced such improved resource efficiency since the early-20th century already and as usual; only, this improvement had been more than offset by continuing industrial expansion, to the effect that world resource consumption was now higher than ever before\u2014and these two historical trends were completely ignored in the report. Taken together, the policy of perpetual economic growth for the entire planet remained virtually intact. Since the publication of the report, the ambiguous and insubstantial slogan of \"sustainable development\" has marched on worldwide.<ref name=ap01/>{{rp|94\u201399}}\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Agroecology]]\n*[[Applied sustainability]]\n*[[Biocapacity]]\n*[[Circles of Sustainability]]\n*[[Circular economy]]\n*[[Computational sustainability]]\n*[[Conservation biology]]\n*[[Conservation development]]\n*[[Cradle-to-cradle]]\n*[[Cultural footprint]]\n*[[Development Studies]]\n*[[Ecological economics]]\n*[[Ecological deficit]]\n*[[Ecological footprint]]\n*[[Ecological modernization]]\n*[[Ecologically sustainable development]]\n*[[Environmental issue]]\n*[[Environmental justice]]\n*[[Environmental racism]]\n*[[Earth system governance]]\n*[[Farmer Research Committee]]\n*[[Futures of Education]]\n*[[Gender and development]]\n*[[Green development]]\n*[[Micro-sustainability]]\n*[[Outline of sustainability]]\n*[[Overshoot (population)|Overshoot]]\n*[[Purple economy]]\n*[[Regenerative design]]\n*[[Social sustainability]]\n*[[Sustainable coffee]]\n*[[Sustainable Development Goals]]\n*[[Sustainable fishery]]\n*[[Sustainable forest management]]\n*[[Sustainable land management]]\n*[[Sustainable living]]\n*[[Sustainable redevelopment]]\n*[[Sustainable yield]]\n*[[Sustainopreneurship]]\n*[[Weak and strong sustainability]]\n*[[Zero-carbon city]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Sources ==\n\n{{Free-content attribution\n| title = Rethinking Education: Towards a global common good?\n| author = \n| publisher = UNESCO\n| page numbers = 32-33\n| source = UNESCO\n| documentURL = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002325/232555e.pdf\n| license statement URL = http://www.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=232555&set=00581C72C5_2_460&gp=1&lin=1&ll=1\n| license = CC-BY-SA IGO 3.0\n}}\n\n{{Free-content attribution\n| title = Issues and trends in education for sustainable development\n| author = \n| publisher = UNESCO\n| page numbers = 276\n| source = UNESDOC\n| documentURL = https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000261445\n| license statement URL = https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000261445\n| license = CC BY-SA\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin|60em}}\n* {{cite book|last=Ahmed|first=Faiz|title=An Examination of the Development Path Taken by Small Island Developing States|url=http://www.islandvulnerability.org/m/ahmedm.pdf|year=2008|access-date=19 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003211109/http://www.islandvulnerability.org/m/ahmedm.pdf|archive-date=3 October 2012|url-status=dead}} (pp.&nbsp;17\u201326)\n* Atkinson, G., S.

ESD aims to empower and equip current and future generations to meet the needs using a balanced and integrated approach to the [[Economy|economic]], [[social]] and [[Biophysical environment|environmental]] dimensions of sustainable development.<ref name=\"UNESCO\">{{Cite book|title=Issues and trends in education for sustainable development|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=978-92-3-100244-1|location=Paris|pages=7}}</ref>\n\n==== Concept ====\nThe concept of [[Monitoring Education for Sustainable Development|ESD]] was born from the need for [[education]] to address the growing and changing  environmental challenges facing the [[planet]]. In order to do this, [[education]] must change to provide the [[knowledge]], skills, values and attitudes that empower [[learner]]s to contribute to sustainable development. At the same time, [[education]] must be strengthened in all agendas, programmes, and activities that promote sustainable development. Sustainable development must be integrated into [[education]] and education must be integrated into sustainable development. ESD promotes the integration of these critical sustainability issues in local and global contexts into the [[curriculum]] to prepare [[Learning|learners]] to understand and respond to the changing world. ESD aims to produce [[Educational aims and objectives|learning outcomes]] that include core competencies such as critical and systematic [[Thought|thinking]], collaborative [[decision-making]], and taking responsibility for the present and [[future generation]]s. Since traditional single-directional delivery of [[knowledge]] is not sufficient to inspire learners to take action as [[Citizenship|responsible citizens]], ESD entails rethinking the [[Learning environment|learning environmen]]<nowiki/>t, physical and virtual. The learning environment itself must adapt and apply a whole-institution approach to embed the philosophy of sustainable development. Building the capacity of [[Education|educators]] and policy support at international, regional, national and local levels helps drive changes in [[learning institution]]s. Empowered youth and local communities interacting with education institutions become key actors in advancing sustainable development.<ref name=\"UNESCO\"/>\n\n==== UN Decade for Sustainable Development ====\nThe launch of the UN Decade of [[Education for sustainable development|Education for Sustainable Development]] (2005-2014) started a global movement to reorient education to address the challenges of sustainable development. Building on the achievement of the Decade, stated in the Aichi-Nagoya Declaration on ESD, [[UNESCO]] endorsed the Global Action Programme on ESD (GAP) in the 37th session of its General Conference. Acknowledged by [[UN general assembly|UN General Assembly]] Resolution A/RES/69/211 and launched at the UNESCO World Conference on ESD in 2014, the GAP aims to scale-up actions and good practices. UNESCO has a major role, along with its partners, in bringing about key achievements to ensure the principles of [[Education for sustainable development|ESD]] are promoted through formal, non-formal and [[informal education]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Issues and trends in education for sustainable development|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=978-92-3-100244-1|location=Paris|pages=8}}</ref>\n\nInternational recognition of ESD as the key enabler for sustainable development is growing steadily. The role of ESD was recognized in three major UN summits on sustainable development: the 1992 [[Earth Summit|UN Conference on Environment and Development]] (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro, [[Brazil]]; the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg, [[South Africa]]; and the 2012 [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development|UN Conference on Sustainable Development]] (UNCSD) in Rio de Janeiro. Other key global agreements such as the [[Paris Agreement]] (Article 12) also recognize the importance of ESD. Today, ESD is arguably at the heart of the [[Sustainable Development Goals|2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development]] and its 17 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs) (United Nations, 2015). The SDGs recognize that all countries must stimulate action in the following key areas - people, [[planet]], prosperity, [[peace]] and [[partnership]] - in order to tackle the global challenges that are crucial for the survival of [[human]]ity. ESD is explicitly mentioned in Target 4.7 of SDG4, which aims to ensure that all [[Learning|learners]] acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development and is understood as an important means to achieve all the other 16 SDGs (UNESCO, 2017).<ref name=\"UNESCO\"/>\n\n==Sub-groups==\n{{See also|Planetary boundaries|Triple bottom line}}\n{{Pillars of sustainability|Scheme of sustainable development: <br/ >at the confluence of three constituent parts.

The [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report]] outlines current knowledge about scientific, technical and socio-economic information concerning [[climate change]], and lists options for [[Adaptation to global warming|adaptation]] and [[Climate change mitigation|mitigation]].<ref name=\"Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability\">{{Cite journal\n | year=2014\n | author=IPCC Fifth Assessment Report\n | title=Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability\n | url=http://templatelab.com/IPCC-WG2-AR5-SPM-Approved/\n | format=PDF\n | publisher= IPCC\n | location=Geneva (Switzerland)\n| author-link=IPCC Fifth Assessment Report\n }}</ref> Environmental sustainability requires society to design activities to meet human needs while preserving the life support systems of the planet. This, for example, entails using water sustainably, utilizing renewable energy, and sustainable material supplies (e.g. harvesting wood from forests at a rate that maintains the biomass and biodiversity).{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nAn unsustainable situation occurs when [[natural capital]] (the sum total of nature's resources) is used up faster than it can be replenished. Sustainability requires that human activity only uses nature's resources at a rate at which they can be replenished naturally. Inherently the concept of sustainable development is intertwined with the concept of carrying capacity. Theoretically, the long-term result of [[environmental degradation]] is the inability to sustain human life.  Such degradation on a global scale should imply an increase in human death rate until population falls to what the degraded environment can support.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}  If the degradation continues beyond a certain [[Planetary boundaries|tipping point]] or critical threshold it would lead to eventual [[extinction]] for humanity.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

A telling example is the [[European environmental research and innovation policy]], which aims at defining and implementing a transformative agenda to greening the economy and the society as a whole so to achieve a truly sustainable development. Research and innovation in Europe is financially supported by the programme [[Horizon 2020]], which is also open to participation worldwide.<ref>See Horizon 2020 \u2013 the EU's new research and innovation programme http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-1085_en.htm</ref> A promising direction towards sustainable development is to design systems that are flexible and reversible.<ref>{{cite journal |date=2012 | doi=10.1080/09613218.2012.702565 | volume=40 |issue = 5|title=Flexible strategies for long-term sustainability under uncertainty |journal=Building Research |pages=545\u2013557 | last1 = Fawcett | first1 = William | last2 = Hughes | first2 = Martin | last3 = Krieg | first3 = Hannes | last4 = Albrecht | first4 = Stefan | last5 = Vennstr\u00f6m | first5 = Anders}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269694158 |last=Zhang|first=S.X.|author2=V.

When the costs of polluting the commons are not calculated into the cost of the items consumed, then it becomes only natural to pollute, as the cost of pollution is external to the cost of the goods produced and the cost of cleaning the waste before it is discharged exceeds the cost of releasing the waste directly into the commons.  So, the only way to solve this problem is by protecting the ecology of the commons by making it, through taxes or fines, more costly to release the waste directly into the commons than would be the cost of cleaning the waste before discharge.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Economics, Ecology, Ethics: Essays toward a Steady-State Economy|last=Daly|first=H.

Once again, this issue needs to be addressed.  Because, left unaddressed, the development of the commonly owned property will become impossible to achieve in a sustainable way.  So, this topic is central to the understanding of creating a sustainable situation from the management of the public resources that are used for personal use.\n\n====Agriculture====\n{{See also|Sustainable agriculture}}\nSustainable agriculture consists of [[environment friendly]] methods of farming that allow the production of crops or livestock without damage to human or natural systems.

Therefore, solutions need to be found so that the economies of the world can continue to grow, but not at the expense of the public good.  In the world of economics the amount of environmental quality must be considered as limited in supply and therefore is treated as a scarce resource. This is a resource to be protected. One common way to analyze possible outcomes of policy decisions on the scarce resource is to do a cost-benefit analysis. This type of analysis contrasts different options of resource allocation and, based on an evaluation of the expected courses of action and the consequences of these actions, the optimal way to do so in the light of different policy goals can be elicited.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Barbier|first1=E.B.|last2=Markandya|first2=A.|last3=Pearce|first3=D.W.|title=Environmental sustainability and cost-benefit analysis|journal=Environment and Planning A|date=1990|volume=22|issue=9|doi=10.1068/a221259|pages=1259\u20131266|citeseerx=10.1.1.335.1749}}</ref>\n\nBenefit-cost analysis basically can look at several ways of solving a problem and then assigning the best route for a solution, based on the set of consequences that would result from the further development of the individual courses of action, and then choosing the course of action that results in the least amount of damage to the expected outcome for the environmental quality that remains after that development or process takes place. Further complicating this analysis are the interrelationships of the various parts of the environment that might be impacted by the chosen course of action.  Sometimes it is almost impossible to predict the various outcomes of a course of action, due to the unexpected consequences and the amount of unknowns that are not accounted for in the benefit-cost analysis.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n====Energy====\n{{Main|Smart grid|Sustainable energy}}\nSustainable energy is clean and can be used over a long period of time.

This can produce a social equity problem, since lower income people usually drive older vehicles with lower fuel efficiency.

This [[eco-efficiency]] is usually calculated as the economic value added by a firm in relation to its aggregated ecological impact.<ref>Schaltegger, S. & Sturm, A. 1998. Eco-Efficiency by Eco-Controlling. Z\u00fcrich: vdf.</ref>  This idea has been popularised by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development ([[WBCSD]]) under the following definition: \"Eco-efficiency is achieved by the delivery of competitively priced goods and services that satisfy human needs and bring quality of life, while progressively reducing ecological impacts and [[resource intensity]] throughout the life-cycle to a level at least in line with the earth's carrying capacity\" (DeSimone and Popoff, 1997: 47).<ref>DeSimone, L. & Popoff, F. 1997. Eco-efficiency: The business link to sustainable development. Cambridge: MIT Press.</ref>\n\nSimilar to the eco-efficiency concept but so far less explored is the second criterion for corporate sustainability. Socio-efficiency<ref name=\"Dyllick, T. 2002\">{{cite journal | last1 = Dyllick | first1 = T. | last2 = Hockerts | first2 = K. | year = 2002 | title = Beyond the business case for corporate sustainability | url = | journal = Business Strategy and the Environment | volume = 11 | issue = 2| pages = 130\u2013141 | doi=10.1002/bse.323}}</ref> describes the relation between a firm's value added and its social impact. Whereas, it can be assumed that most corporate impacts on the environment are negative (apart from rare exceptions such as the planting of trees) this is not true for social impacts. These can be either positive (e.g. corporate giving, creation of employment) or negative (e.g. work accidents, mobbing of employees, human rights abuses). Depending on the type of impact socio-efficiency thus either tries to minimise negative social impacts (i.e. accidents per value added) or maximise positive social impacts (i.e. donations per value added) in relation to the value added.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nBoth eco-efficiency and socio-efficiency are concerned primarily with increasing economic sustainability. In this process they instrumentalise both natural and social capital aiming to benefit from win-win situations. However, as Dyllick and Hockerts<ref name=\"Dyllick, T. 2002\"/> point out the business case alone will not be sufficient to realise sustainable development. They point towards eco-effectiveness, socio-effectiveness, sufficiency, and eco-equity as four criteria that need to be met if sustainable development is to be reached.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=William|last2=Tilley|first2=Fiona|date=2006|title=Can businesses move beyond efficiency?

The political is defined as the domain of practices and meanings associated with basic issues of social power as they pertain to the organisation, authorisation, legitimation and regulation of a social life held in common. This definition is in accord with the view that political change is important for responding to economic, ecological and cultural challenges. It also means that the politics of economic change can be addressed. They have listed seven subdomains of the domain of politics:<ref name=\"citiesprogramme.com\"/>\n\n#Organization and governance\n#Law and justice\n#Communication and critique\n#Representation and negotiation\n#Security and accord\n#Dialogue and reconciliation\n#Ethics and accountability\n\nThis accords with the Brundtland Commission emphasis on development that is guided by human rights principles (see above).\n\n===Culture===\n\n[[File:Circles of Sustainability image (assessment - Melbourne 2011).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Framing of sustainable development progress according to the [[Circles of Sustainability]], used by the [[United Nations Global Compact|United Nations]].]]\nWorking with a different emphasis, some researchers and institutions have pointed out that a fourth dimension should be added to the dimensions of sustainable development, since the triple-bottom-line dimensions of economic, environmental and social do not seem to be enough to reflect the complexity of contemporary society. In this context, the [[Agenda 21 for culture]] and the [[United Cities and Local Governments]] (UCLG)  Executive Bureau lead the preparation of the policy statement \"Culture: Fourth Pillar of Sustainable Development\", passed on 17 November 2010, in the framework of the World Summit of Local and Regional Leaders&nbsp;\u2013 3rd World Congress of UCLG, held in Mexico City. This document inaugurates a new perspective and points to the relation between culture and sustainable development through a dual approach: developing a solid [[cultural policy]] and advocating a cultural dimension in all public policies.

It is currently applied to 58 cities.<ref>{{Cite web|title = SDEWES Centre - SDEWES Index|url = http://www.sdewes.org/sdewes_index.php|website = www.sdewes.org|accessdate = 2015-10-17}}</ref>\n\n===Natural capital===\n[[File:Hillside deforestation in Rio de Janeiro.jpg|thumb|alt=Deforastation of native rain forest in Rio de Janeiro City for extraction of clay for civil construction|[[Deforestation]] of native [[rain forest]] in Rio de Janeiro City for extraction of [[clay]] for [[civil engineering]] (2009 picture).]]\nThe sustainable development debate is based on the assumption that societies need to manage three types of capital (economic, social, and natural), which may be non-substitutable and whose consumption might be irreversible.<ref name=\"Dyllick, T. 2002\"/> Leading [[Ecological economics|ecological economist]] and [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state theorist]] [[Herman Daly]],<ref name=hd01/> for example, points to the fact that [[natural capital]] can not necessarily be substituted by economic capital. While it is possible that we can find ways to replace some natural resources, it is much more unlikely that they will ever be able to replace eco-system services, such as the protection provided by the ozone layer, or the climate stabilizing function of the Amazonian forest. In fact natural capital, social capital and economic capital are often complementarities. A further obstacle to substitutability lies also in the multi-functionality of many natural resources. Forests, for example, not only provide the raw material for paper (which can be substituted quite easily), but they also maintain biodiversity, regulate water flow, and absorb CO2.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nAnother problem of natural and social capital deterioration lies in their partial irreversibility. The [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]], for example, is often definitive. The same can be true for cultural diversity. For example, with globalisation advancing quickly the number of indigenous languages is dropping at alarming rates.  Moreover, the depletion of natural and social capital may have non-linear consequences. Consumption of natural and social capital may have no observable impact until a certain threshold is reached. A lake can, for example, absorb nutrients for a long time while actually increasing its productivity. However, once a certain level of algae is reached lack of oxygen causes the lake's ecosystem to break down suddenly.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fws.gov/nc-es/edout/albenutrient.html|title=Nutrients: Too Much of a Good Thing|last=Newcomb|first=Doug|date=|website=United States Fish and Wildlife Service|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012180755/http://www.fws.gov/nc-es/edout/albenutrient.html|archivedate=2006-10-12|accessdate=17 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Business-as-usual===\n[[File:Air pollution by industrial chimneys.jpg|thumb|Before [[flue-gas desulfurization]] was installed, the [[air pollution|air-polluting]] emissions from this power plant in [[New Mexico]] contained excessive amounts of [[sulfur dioxide]].]]\nIf the degradation of natural and social capital has such important consequence the question arises why action is not taken more systematically to alleviate it.

Second, natural capital is often undervalued by society since we are not fully aware of the real cost of the depletion of natural capital. Information asymmetry is a third reason\u2014often the link between cause and effect is obscured, making it difficult for actors to make informed choices. Cohen and Winn close with the realization that contrary to economic theory many firms are not perfect optimisers. They postulate that firms often do not optimise resource allocation because they are caught in a \"business as usual\" mentality.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n===Education===\n''Main page: [[Education for sustainable development]]''\n\nEducation must be revisited in light of a renewed vision of sustainable human and social development that is both equitable and viable. This vision of sustainability must take into consideration the social, environmental and economic dimensions of human development and the various ways in which these relate to education: 'An empowering education is one that builds the human resources we need to be productive, to continue to learn, to solve problems, to be creative, and to live together and with nature in peace and harmony. When nations ensure that such an education is accessible to all throughout their lives, a quiet revolution is set in motion: education becomes the engine of sustainable development and the key to a better world.'<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Power of Education: Education for All, Development, Globalisation and UNESCO|last=Power|first=C|publisher=London, Springer|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002325/232555e.pdf|title=Rethinking Education: Towards a global common good?|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100088-1|location=|pages=31\u201332}}</ref>\n\n== Insubstantial stretching of the term ==\n{{Criticism section|date=August 2019}}\n{{Essay|section|date=August 2019}}\n{{undue weight|section|date=August 2019}}\nIt has been argued that since the 1960s, the concept of sustainable development has changed from \"conservation management\" to \"economic development\", whereby the original meaning of the concept has been stretched somewhat.<ref name=to01/>{{rp|48\u201354}}\n\nIn the 1960s, the international community realised that many African countries needed national plans to safeguard wildlife habitats, and that rural areas had to confront the limits imposed by soil, climate and water availability. This was a strategy of conservation management. In the 1970s, however, the focus shifted to the broader issues of the provisioning of basic human needs, community participation as well as appropriate technology use throughout the developing countries (and not just in Africa). This was a strategy of economic development, and the strategy was carried even further by the [[Brundtland Commission]]'s report on ''[[Our Common Future]]'' when the issues went from regional to international in scope and application.<ref name=to01/>{{rp|48\u201354}} In effect, the conservationists were crowded out and superseded by the developers.\n\nBut shifting the focus of sustainable development from conservation to development has had the imperceptible effect of stretching the original forest management term of [[sustainable yield]] from the use of renewable resources only (like forestry), to now also accounting for the use of non-renewable resources (like [[Natural resource#Classification|minerals]]).<ref name=kt01/>{{rp|13}} This stretching of the term has been questioned. Thus, environmental economist Kerry Turner has argued that literally, there can be no such thing as overall \"sustainable development\" in an industrialised [[world economy]] that remains heavily dependent on the extraction of earth's finite stock of exhaustible mineral resources: \"It makes no sense to talk about the sustainable use of a non-renewable resource (even with substantial [[recycling]] effort and reduction in use rates). Any positive rate of exploitation will eventually lead to exhaustion of the finite stock.\"<ref name=kt01/>{{rp|13}}\n\nIn effect, it has been argued that the industrial revolution as a whole is unsustainable.<ref name=ngr01/>{{rp|20f}} <ref name=jr01/>{{rp|61\u201367}} <ref name=hd01/>{{rp|22f}} <ref>{{cite journal |last=Duncan |first=Richard C. |authorlink=Richard C.

After World War II, the notion of \"development\" had been established in the West to imply the projection of the American model of society onto the rest of the world. In the 1970s and 1980s, this notion was broadened somewhat to also imply human rights, basic human needs and finally, ecological issues. The emphasis of the report was on helping poor nations out of poverty and meeting the basic needs of their growing populations\u2014as usual. This issue demanded more economic growth, also in the rich countries, who would then import more goods from the poor countries to help them out\u2014as usual. When the discussion switched to [[Steady-state economy#Present background: Exceeding global limits to growth|global ecological limits to growth]], the obvious dilemma was left aside by calling for economic growth with improved resource efficiency, or what was termed \"a change in the ''quality'' of growth\". However, most countries in the West had experienced such improved resource efficiency since the early-20th century already and as usual; only, this improvement had been more than offset by continuing industrial expansion, to the effect that world resource consumption was now higher than ever before\u2014and these two historical trends were completely ignored in the report. Taken together, the policy of perpetual economic growth for the entire planet remained virtually intact. Since the publication of the report, the ambiguous and insubstantial slogan of \"sustainable development\" has marched on worldwide.<ref name=ap01/>{{rp|94\u201399}}\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Agroecology]]\n*[[Applied sustainability]]\n*[[Biocapacity]]\n*[[Circles of Sustainability]]\n*[[Circular economy]]\n*[[Computational sustainability]]\n*[[Conservation biology]]\n*[[Conservation development]]\n*[[Cradle-to-cradle]]\n*[[Cultural footprint]]\n*[[Development Studies]]\n*[[Ecological economics]]\n*[[Ecological deficit]]\n*[[Ecological footprint]]\n*[[Ecological modernization]]\n*[[Ecologically sustainable development]]\n*[[Environmental issue]]\n*[[Environmental justice]]\n*[[Environmental racism]]\n*[[Earth system governance]]\n*[[Farmer Research Committee]]\n*[[Futures of Education]]\n*[[Gender and development]]\n*[[Green development]]\n*[[Micro-sustainability]]\n*[[Outline of sustainability]]\n*[[Overshoot (population)|Overshoot]]\n*[[Purple economy]]\n*[[Regenerative design]]\n*[[Social sustainability]]\n*[[Sustainable coffee]]\n*[[Sustainable Development Goals]]\n*[[Sustainable fishery]]\n*[[Sustainable forest management]]\n*[[Sustainable land management]]\n*[[Sustainable living]]\n*[[Sustainable redevelopment]]\n*[[Sustainable yield]]\n*[[Sustainopreneurship]]\n*[[Weak and strong sustainability]]\n*[[Zero-carbon city]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Sources ==\n\n{{Free-content attribution\n| title = Rethinking Education: Towards a global common good?\n| author = \n| publisher = UNESCO\n| page numbers = 32-33\n| source = UNESCO\n| documentURL = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002325/232555e.pdf\n| license statement URL = http://www.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=232555&set=00581C72C5_2_460&gp=1&lin=1&ll=1\n| license = CC-BY-SA IGO 3.0\n}}\n\n{{Free-content attribution\n| title = Issues and trends in education for sustainable development\n| author = \n| publisher = UNESCO\n| page numbers = 276\n| source = UNESDOC\n| documentURL = https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000261445\n| license statement URL = https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000261445\n| license = CC BY-SA\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin|60em}}\n* {{cite book|last=Ahmed|first=Faiz|title=An Examination of the Development Path Taken by Small Island Developing States|url=http://www.islandvulnerability.org/m/ahmedm.pdf|year=2008|access-date=19 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003211109/http://www.islandvulnerability.org/m/ahmedm.pdf|archive-date=3 October 2012|url-status=dead}} (pp.&nbsp;17\u201326)\n* Atkinson, G., S.

{"title_page": "Plutonium", "text_new": "{{About|the radioactive element}}\n{{pp-semi-indef}}\n{{pp-move-indef}}\n{{short description|chemical element with atomic number 94}}\n{{infobox plutonium}}\n'''Plutonium''' is a [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] [[chemical element]] with the [[Symbol (chemistry)|symbol]] '''Pu''' and [[atomic number]] 94. It is an [[actinide]] [[metal]] of silvery-gray appearance that [[tarnish]]es when exposed to air, and forms a dull coating when [[plutonium(IV) oxide|oxidized]]. The element normally exhibits six [[allotrope]]s and four [[oxidation state]]s. It reacts with [[carbon]], [[halogen]]s, [[nitrogen]], [[silicon]], and [[hydrogen]]. When exposed to moist air, it forms [[oxide]]s and [[hydride]]s that can expand the sample up to 70% in volume, which in turn flake off as a powder that is [[pyrophoricity|pyrophoric]]. It is radioactive and can accumulate in [[bone]]s, which makes the handling of plutonium dangerous.\n\nPlutonium was first produced and isolated on December 14, 1940, by a [[Deuterium|deuteron]] bombardment of [[uranium-238]] in the 1.5 metre (60&nbsp;in) [[cyclotron]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. First, [[neptunium-238]] ([[half-life]] 2.1 days) was synthesized, which subsequently [[Beta decay|beta-decayed]] to form the new element with atomic number 94 and atomic weight 238 (half-life 88 years). Since [[uranium]] had been named after the planet [[Uranus]] and [[neptunium]] after the planet [[Neptune]], element 94 was named after [[Pluto]], which at the time was considered to be a planet as well. Wartime secrecy prevented the University of California team from publishing its discovery until 1948. \n\nPlutonium is the element with the highest atomic number to occur in nature. Trace quantities arise in natural uranium-238 deposits when uranium-238 captures neutrons emitted by decay of other uranium-238 atoms. Plutonium is much more common on Earth since 1945 as a product of [[neutron capture]] and [[beta decay]], where some of the [[neutron]]s released by the [[nuclear fission|fission]] process convert uranium-238 nuclei into plutonium-239.\n\nBoth [[plutonium-239]] and [[plutonium-241]] are [[fissile]], meaning that they can sustain a [[nuclear chain reaction]], leading to applications in [[nuclear weapon]]s and [[nuclear reactor]]s. [[Plutonium-240]] exhibits a high rate of [[spontaneous fission]], raising the [[neutron flux]] of any sample containing it. The presence of plutonium-240 limits a plutonium sample's usability for weapons or its quality as reactor fuel, and the percentage of plutonium-240 determines its [[reactor-grade plutonium|grade]] ([[weapons-grade]], fuel-grade, or reactor-grade). [[Plutonium-238]] has a half-life of 87.7 years and emits [[alpha particle]]s. It is a heat source in [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s, which are used to power some [[spacecraft]]. Plutonium isotopes are expensive and inconvenient to separate, so particular isotopes are usually manufactured in specialized reactors.\n\nProducing plutonium in useful quantities for the first time was a major part of the [[Manhattan Project]] during [[World War II]] that developed the first atomic bombs. The [[Fat Man]] bombs used in the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity]] [[nuclear test]] in July 1945, and in the [[bombing of Nagasaki]] in August 1945, had plutonium [[pit (nuclear weapon)|cores]]. [[Human radiation experiments]] studying plutonium were conducted without [[informed consent]], and several [[criticality accident]]s, some lethal, occurred after the war. Disposal of [[nuclear waste|plutonium waste]] from [[nuclear power plant]]s and [[nuclear disarmament|dismantled nuclear weapons]] built during the [[Cold War]] is a [[nuclear proliferation|nuclear-proliferation]] and environmental concern. Other sources of [[plutonium in the environment]] are [[nuclear fallout|fallout]] from numerous above-ground nuclear tests, now [[Partial Test Ban Treaty|banned]].\n\n==Characteristics==\n===Physical properties===\nPlutonium, like most metals, has a bright silvery appearance at first, much like [[nickel]], but it [[plutonium(IV) oxide|oxidizes]] very quickly to a dull gray, although yellow and olive green are also reported.<ref name = \"WISER\">\n{{cite web\n|url = http://webwiser.nlm.nih.gov/getSubstanceData.do;jsessionid=89B673C34252C77B4C276F2B2D0E4260?substanceID=419&displaySubstanceName=Plutonium,%20Radioactive&UNNAID=&STCCID=&selectedDataMenuItemID=44\n|publisher = U.S. National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health\n|location = Bethesda (MD)\n|title = Plutonium, Radioactive\n|work = Wireless Information System for Emergency Responders (WISER)\n|accessdate = November 23, 2008\n}} (public domain text)</ref><ref>\n{{cite journal\n|title = Nitric acid processing\n|url = http://www.lanl.gov/discover/publications/actinide-research-quarterly/\n|journal = Actinide Research Quarterly\n|date = 2008\n|issue = 3rd quarter\n|publisher = Los Alamos National Laboratory\n|location = Los Alamos (NM)\n|quote = While plutonium dioxide is normally olive green, samples can be various colors.

[[Silicon]], [[indium]], [[zinc]] and [[zirconium]] allow formation of metastable \u03b4 state when rapidly cooled.

If the alloying metal is sufficiently reductive, plutonium can be added in the form of oxides or halides.

Using theoretical information garnered from the operation of CP-1, DuPont constructed an air-cooled experimental production reactor, known as X-10, and a pilot chemical separation facility at Oak Ridge. The separation facility, using methods developed by Glenn T. Seaborg and a team of researchers at the Met Lab, removed plutonium from uranium irradiated in the X-10 reactor.

These studies began in 1944 at the University of California at Berkeley's Radiation Laboratory and were conducted by Joseph G. Hamilton. Hamilton was looking to answer questions about how plutonium would vary in the body depending on exposure mode (oral ingestion, inhalation, absorption through skin), retention rates, and how plutonium would be fixed in tissues and distributed among the various organs. Hamilton started administering soluble microgram portions of plutonium-239 compounds to rats using different valence states and different methods of introducing the plutonium (oral, intravenous, etc.). Eventually, the lab at Chicago also conducted its own plutonium injection experiments using different animals such as mice, rabbits, fish, and even dogs. The results of the studies at Berkeley and Chicago showed that plutonium's physiological behavior differed significantly from that of radium. The most alarming result was that there was significant deposition of plutonium in the liver and in the \"actively metabolizing\" portion of bone. Furthermore, the rate of plutonium elimination in the excreta differed between species of animals by as much as a factor of five. Such variation made it extremely difficult to estimate what the rate would be for human beings.<ref name=\"FAY\">{{cite web |url=http://www.atomicheritage.org/history/plutonium |title=Plutonium |publisher=Atomic Heritage Foundation |accessdate=September 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Production during the Manhattan Project===\nDuring World War II the U.S. government established the [[Manhattan Project]], which was tasked with developing an atomic bomb.

The separation building in 200-East, B Plant, was completed in February 1945. The second facility planned for 200-East was canceled. Nicknamed Queen Marys by the workers who built them, the separation buildings were awesome canyon-like structures 800 feet long, 65 feet wide, and 80 feet high containing forty process pools. The interior had an eerie quality as operators behind seven feet of concrete shielding manipulated remote control equipment by looking through television monitors and periscopes from an upper gallery. Even with massive concrete lids on the process pools, precautions against radiation exposure were necessary and influenced all aspects of plant design.<ref name=\"FAP\" />\n\nOn April 5, 1944, [[Emilio Segr\u00e8]] at Los Alamos received the first sample of reactor-produced plutonium from Oak Ridge.<ref name=\"AtomicTimeline\">\n{{cite web\n|url = http://www.atomicheritage.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=288&Itemid=202\n|title = Atomic History Timeline 1942\u20131944\n|publisher = Atomic Heritage Foundation\n|last = Sublette\n|first = Carey\n|location = Washington (DC)\n|accessdate = December 22, 2008\n}}</ref> Within ten days, he discovered that reactor-bred plutonium had a higher concentration of the isotope plutonium-240 than cyclotron-produced plutonium.

It is an [[actinide]] [[metal]] of silvery-gray appearance that [[tarnish]]es when exposed to air, and forms a dull coating when [[plutonium(IV) oxide|oxidized]]. The element normally exhibits six [[allotrope]]s and four [[oxidation state]]s. It reacts with [[carbon]], [[halogen]]s, [[nitrogen]], [[silicon]], and [[hydrogen]]. When exposed to moist air, it forms [[oxide]]s and [[hydride]]s that can expand the sample up to 70% in volume, which in turn flake off as a powder that is [[pyrophoricity|pyrophoric]]. It is radioactive and can accumulate in [[bone]]s, which makes the handling of plutonium dangerous.\n\nPlutonium was first produced and isolated on December 14, 1940, by a [[Deuterium|deuteron]] bombardment of [[uranium-238]] in the 1.5 metre (60&nbsp;in) [[cyclotron]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. First, [[neptunium-238]] ([[half-life]] 2.1 days) was synthesized, which subsequently [[Beta decay|beta-decayed]] to form the new element with atomic number 94 and atomic weight 238 (half-life 88 years). Since [[uranium]] had been named after the planet [[Uranus]] and [[neptunium]] after the planet [[Neptune]], element 94 was named after [[Pluto]], which at the time was considered to be a planet as well. Wartime secrecy prevented the University of California team from publishing its discovery until 1948. \n\nPlutonium is the element with the highest atomic number to occur in nature. Trace quantities arise in natural uranium-238 deposits when uranium-238 captures neutrons emitted by decay of other uranium-238 atoms. Plutonium is much more common on Earth since 1945 as a product of [[neutron capture]] and [[beta decay]], where some of the [[neutron]]s released by the [[nuclear fission|fission]] process convert uranium-238 nuclei into plutonium-239.\n\nBoth [[plutonium-239]] and [[plutonium-241]] are [[fissile]], meaning that they can sustain a [[nuclear chain reaction]], leading to applications in [[nuclear weapon]]s and [[nuclear reactor]]s. [[Plutonium-240]] exhibits a high rate of [[spontaneous fission]], raising the [[neutron flux]] of any sample containing it. The presence of plutonium-240 limits a plutonium sample's usability for weapons or its quality as reactor fuel, and the percentage of plutonium-240 determines its [[reactor-grade plutonium|grade]] ([[weapons-grade]], fuel-grade, or reactor-grade). [[Plutonium-238]] has a half-life of 87.7 years and emits [[alpha particle]]s. It is a heat source in [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s, which are used to power some [[spacecraft]]. Plutonium isotopes are expensive and inconvenient to separate, so particular isotopes are usually manufactured in specialized reactors.\n\nProducing plutonium in useful quantities for the first time was a major part of the [[Manhattan Project]] during [[World War II]] that developed the first atomic bombs. The [[Fat Man]] bombs used in the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity]] [[nuclear test]] in July 1945, and in the [[bombing of Nagasaki]] in August 1945, had plutonium [[pit (nuclear weapon)|cores]].

The energy difference between the 6d and 5f subshells is very low. The size of the 5f shell is just enough to allow the electrons to form bonds within the lattice, on the very boundary between localized and bonding behavior. The proximity of energy levels leads to multiple low-energy electron configurations with near equal energy levels. This leads to competing 5f<sup>n</sup>7s<sup>2</sup> and 5f<sup>n\u22121</sup>6d<sup>1</sup>7s<sup>2</sup> configurations, which causes the complexity of its chemical behavior.

Using theoretical information garnered from the operation of CP-1, DuPont constructed an air-cooled experimental production reactor, known as X-10, and a pilot chemical separation facility at Oak Ridge. The separation facility, using methods developed by Glenn T. Seaborg and a team of researchers at the Met Lab, removed plutonium from uranium irradiated in the X-10 reactor.

These studies began in 1944 at the University of California at Berkeley's Radiation Laboratory and were conducted by Joseph G. Hamilton. Hamilton was looking to answer questions about how plutonium would vary in the body depending on exposure mode (oral ingestion, inhalation, absorption through skin), retention rates, and how plutonium would be fixed in tissues and distributed among the various organs. Hamilton started administering soluble microgram portions of plutonium-239 compounds to rats using different valence states and different methods of introducing the plutonium (oral, intravenous, etc.). Eventually, the lab at Chicago also conducted its own plutonium injection experiments using different animals such as mice, rabbits, fish, and even dogs. The results of the studies at Berkeley and Chicago showed that plutonium's physiological behavior differed significantly from that of radium. The most alarming result was that there was significant deposition of plutonium in the liver and in the \"actively metabolizing\" portion of bone.

The separation building in 200-East, B Plant, was completed in February 1945. The second facility planned for 200-East was canceled. Nicknamed Queen Marys by the workers who built them, the separation buildings were awesome canyon-like structures 800 feet long, 65 feet wide, and 80 feet high containing forty process pools. The interior had an eerie quality as operators behind seven feet of concrete shielding manipulated remote control equipment by looking through television monitors and periscopes from an upper gallery.

In a moist environment, plutonium forms [[hydrides]] on its surface, which are pyrophoric and may ignite in air at room temperature. Plutonium expands up to 70% in volume as it oxidizes and thus may break its container.<ref name = \"NucSafety\"/> The radioactivity of the burning material is an additional hazard. [[Magnesium oxide]] sand is probably the most effective material for extinguishing a plutonium fire. It cools the burning material, acting as a [[heat sink]], and also blocks off oxygen. Special precautions are necessary to store or handle plutonium in any form; generally a dry [[inert gas]] atmosphere is required.<ref name=\"NucSafety\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hss.energy.gov/NuclearSafety/techstds/standard/hdbk1081/hbk1081d.html#ZZ281 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070428220410/http://www.hss.energy.gov/NuclearSafety/techstds/standard/hdbk1081/hbk1081d.html |archivedate=April 28, 2007 |title=Primer on Spontaneous Heating and Pyrophoricity \u2013 Pyrophoric Metals \u2013 Plutonium |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Nuclear Safety, Quality Assurance and Environment |date=1994 |location=Washington (DC) |url-status=dead }}</ref>{{efn|group=note|There was a major plutonium-initiated fire at the [[Rocky Flats Plant]] near [[Boulder, Colorado]] in 1969.<ref>{{cite web|first = David|last = Albright|last2=O'Neill |first2=Kevin|date = 1999|url = http://www.isis-online.org/publications/usfacilities/Rfpbrf.html|title = The Lessons of Nuclear Secrecy at Rocky Flats|work = ISIS Issue Brief|accessdate = December 7, 2008|publisher = Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS)| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080708220510/http://www.isis-online.org/publications/usfacilities/Rfpbrf.html| archivedate = July 8, 2008}}</ref> }}\n\n==Transportation==\nAround 11 metric tons of plutonium may be possessed by Japan alone, with 36 tons pending return after reprocessing in Britain and France.
