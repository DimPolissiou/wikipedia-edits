The road is paralleled by [[Metro North Railroad]]'s [[New Haven Line]] to the northwest, which also carries [[Amtrak]]'s [[Northeast Corridor]], which it follows for much of its length throughout the state. I-95 heads northeast, passing through the affluent suburban development of the [[Gold Coast (Connecticut)|Gold Coast]] of southwestern Fairfield County and reaching a [[weigh station]] in the northbound direction, before turning east-northeast and passing south of downtown Greenwich. The road then heads into the neighborhood of [[Cos Cob, Connecticut|Cos Cob]] before it crosses over the New Haven Line and the [[Mianus River]], on the [[Mianus River Bridge]].

The road crosses the [[Rippowam River]] and enters the dense commercial area of [[Downtown Stamford]], where it briefly becomes elevated and serves [[Connecticut Route 137|Route&nbsp;137]]. Upon leaving the downtown area, the freeway passes over the New Haven Line and crosses into the residential [[East Side of Stamford]], where there is an interchange with US 1 that also provides access to [[Connecticut Route 106|Route 106]]. After this point, the southbound direction gains a fourth lane as the road enters the town of [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]], where there is a service plaza in the southbound direction. In the community of [[Noroton, Connecticut|Noroton]]; the highway passes to the south of [[Noroton Heights station]] on the New Haven Line. Near the center of town, the southbound direction narrows to three lanes again, and I-95 has interchanges with US 1 and [[Connecticut Route 136|Route 136]]. Next, the freeway turns to the northeast, passing over the New Haven Line and coming to a service plaza and welcome center in the northbound direction, before reaching another interchange with US 1.<ref name=\"google\" /> \n\nImmediately after, the road comes into the city of [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] in the neighborhood of [[South Norwalk]]. The freeway turns east-northeast and passes north of [[Maritime Aquarium at Norwalk]] as it comes to an interchange with the southern terminus of [[U.S. Route 7 in Connecticut|US 7]] and crosses the [[Danbury Branch]] of the New Haven Line within the interchange, before crossing the [[Norwalk River]] on the [[Yankee Doodle Bridge]] and entering [[East Norwalk]]. I-95 enters the town of [[Westport, Connecticut|Westport]], just prior to reaching an interchange with the southern terminus [[Connecticut Route 33|Route 33]] and Route 136. Past this interchange, the freeway proceeds to cross over the [[Saugatuck River]] and continues to an interchange with the Sherwood Island Connector, which provides access to US 1 and [[Sherwood Island State Park]]. The road curves through wooded residential areas, where it comes into the town of [[Fairfield, Connecticut|Fairfield]]. Here, I-95 reaches an interchange with US 1/Center Street, which serve the neighborhood of [[Southport, Connecticut|Southport]], before crossing the [[Mill River (Fairfield, Connecticut)|Mill River]]. Passing to the north of [[Fairfield Center]], the freeway reaches a service plaza in both directions, where there also exists an interchange  with [[Connecticut Route 135|Route 135]], providing access to the main campus of [[Fairfield University]].

On the city's West Side, the freeway has an interchange with [[Connecticut Route 130|Route 130]], where it becomes elevated and gains a fourth southbound lane, as it passes through the industrial areas of the city's southwestern neighborhoods. Within that interchange, the road also crosses the New Haven Line. Further within the area, I-95 crosses over the New Haven Line again and passes to south of downtown Bridgeport. Here, the freeway provides access to many of the city's major landmarks in the South End and downtown area, and meets southern terminus of [[Connecticut Route 8|Route 8]] and [[Connecticut Route 25|Route 25]], which both head north from I-95 as a four-lane freeway. From this point, the road narrows to three lanes in the southbound direction, and comes onto to the [[P.T. Barnum Bridge]] which carries it over the New Haven Line, adjacent to the [[Bridgeport station (Connecticut)|Bridgeport station]], and the [[Pequonnock River]]. On the bridge, the northbound direction gains a fourth lane, as it comes to an exit for [[Connecticut Route 127|Route 127]] on Bridgeport's east side, after it passes over Route 130. I-95 reduces back to three lanes in the northbound direction, as it curves into the city's East End, where there is another interchange for Route 130. A short distance later, the freeway reaches an exit to [[Connecticut Route 113|Route 113]] on the border of [[Stratford, Connecticut|Stratford]], providing access to the [[Sikorsky Memorial Airport]]. Afterward, the road passes by downtown Stratford and heads into a commercial area, where it has an exit serving US 1 and the southern terminus of [[Connecticut Route 110|Route 110]], before crossing the [[Housatonic River]] on the [[Moses Wheeler Bridge]].<ref name=\"google\" />\n\n===New Haven County===\n\nOn the Moses Wheeler Bridge, I-95 crosses into [[Milford, Connecticut|Milford]], [[New Haven County, Connecticut|New Haven County]], where it heads into residential areas on the other side of the river. Here, the freeway has a trumpet interchange with US 1, within the village of [[Devon (Milford)|Devon]], before it crosses the New Haven Line and reaches an interchange with Schoolhouse Road/Sub Way, in which the latter road is named for the world headquarters of the [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]] restaurant chain. The road continues northeast through wooded areas of the western part of Milford, where it reaches the interchange with the [[Milford Parkway (Connecticut)|Milford Parkway]] to the northeast of Downtown Milford. The Milford Parkway, a four-lane limited access parkway, provides access from I-95, as well as US 1 to [[Merritt Parkway]] and [[Wilbur Cross Parkway]], which are both components of [[Connecticut Route 15|Route 15]]. The freeway enters a reverse turn, where it comes to a cloverleaf interchange with US 1 adjacent to the [[Connecticut Post Mall]], located at the northeastern corner of the interchange. The road heads northeast again into commercial surroundings and passes service plazas in both directions, before coming into the town of [[Orange, Connecticut|Orange]], where it reaches an interchange with Marsh Hill Road. The overpass carrying Marsh Hill Road is called the [[Salemme Memorial Bridge]], and the exit provides access to the West Campus of [[Yale University]].<ref name=\"google\" />\n\n[[File:Interstate 95 in Connecticut (40702893654).jpg|thumb|left|I-95 northbound near the interchange with I-91]]\nThe road passes to the northwest of the university campus as it enters the city of [[West Haven, Connecticut|West Haven]]. Here, I-95 passes mixed areas of suburban development, where it comes to an interchange with [[Connecticut Route 162|Route 162]]. Thru trucks to Downtown West Haven must use this exit, as trucks may not use the northbound exit ramp at the next interchange, for Campbell Avenue and the southern terminus of [[Connecticut Route 122|Route 122]], due to its steep incline. The road makes another reverse turn, where it crosses the New Haven Line and the [[West River (Connecticut)|West River]], and comes into the city of [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]]. Immediately after crossing the river, I-95 comes to an interchange with the southern terminus of [[Connecticut Route 10|Route 10]], which provides access to the [[Yale Bowl]] and connects to [[Connecticut Route 34|Route 34]]. From this point, the freeway heads northeast, passing the [[New Haven Harbor]] in the neighborhood of [[Long Wharf (New Haven)|Long Wharf]], before reaching the large interchange complex southeast of [[Downtown New Haven]]. The complex includes an interchange with a flyover ramp to M.L.K. Jr. Boulevard serving the downtown area, as well as the highway's split with [[Interstate 91|I-91]], which heads north-northeast from I-95 towards [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]]. Past I-91, the freeway turns southeast to cross the [[Quinnipiac River]] on the [[Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge (Connecticut)|Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge]], locally known as simply the \"Q Bridge\". On the other side of the bridge, the road heads into another area of mixed development in [[The Annex (New Haven)|The Annex]] neighborhood. Here, I-95, expands to four lanes in the southbound direction, and has an interchange with the northern terminus of [[Connecticut Route 337|Route 337]], that also provides access to [[Tweed New Haven Airport]].<ref name=\"google\" />\n\nPast this interchange, the freeway enters the town of [[East Haven, Connecticut|East Haven]], where US 1 parallels the highway on the both sides as a frontage road as the southbound direction narrows back to three lanes, before coming to a partial interchange with that route. Within the interchange, it also crosses the Northeast Corridor. A short distance later, there is a southbound exit and northbound entrance with [[Connecticut Route 100|Route 100]] before the road curves east across [[Saltonstall Mountain]] and [[Lake Saltonstall (Connecticut)|Lake Saltonstall]], and comes into the town of [[Branford, Connecticut|Branford]]. Within this area, I-95 passes through the [[Stewart B. McKinney National Wildlife Refuge]] where it comes to an northbound exit and southbound entrance with the [[Branford Connector]], that connects to US 1, [[Connecticut Route 142|Route 142]], and [[Connecticut Route 146|Route 146]] near [[Short Beach]]. Just after the connector, there is a service plaza in both directions, and the freeway passes north of the center of Branford. From here, the road narrows to four lanes and continues east into more rural and wooded surroundings, coming to an interchange with US 1 on the east side of town. I-95 briefly enters a commercial area and passes north of the [[Stony Creek (Branford)|Stony Creek]] neighborhood. The freeway heads back into wooded areas as it enters the town of [[Guilford, Connecticut|Guilford]], where it comes to interchanges with US 1, [[Connecticut Route 77|Route 77]], north of Guilford Center. The road continues east across the East River marshlands, and comes into the town of [[Madison, Connecticut|Madison]] prior to crossing the Neck River. The road heads to the north of Madison Center, where it has an interchange with [[Connecticut Route 79|Route 79]] with a park and ride lot in its northeastern corner. Past Route 79, I-95 passes service plazas in both directions, and reaches an interchange with the [[Hammonasset Connector]], which provides access to [[Hammonasset Beach State Park]]. At this point, the route crosses over the [[Hammonasset River]] and leaves New Haven County.<ref name=\"google\" />\n\n===Middlesex and New London counties===\n[[File:Int95nRoadCT-Exit69-CT9n (36127776443).jpg|thumb|right|I-95 northbound in Old Saybrook]]\nUpon crossing the river, I-95 comes into [[Clinton, Connecticut|Clinton]], [[Middlesex County, Connecticut|Middlesex County]] continuing east through rural surroundings with some suburban elements. The freeway reaches an interchange with [[Connecticut Route 81|Route 81]], close to the center of town adjacent to the Clinton Crossing Premium Outlets outlet mall, to the northwest of the interchange. From here, the road makes a reverse turn across the Menunketesuck River, after which it enters the town of [[Westbrook, Connecticut|Westbrook]] and reaches an interchange with [[Connecticut Route 145|Route 145]]. At this point, I-95 makes another reverse turn before turning east again, at the interchange with [[Connecticut Route 153|Route 153]] that also provides access to the Westbrook Outlets outlet mall, just north of Westbrook Center. The freeway then reaches a pair of roadside stops, in which the northbound direction has a rest area and welcome center, and the southbound direction has access to Troop F of the [[Connecticut State Police]], just before coming to the interchange for [[Connecticut Route 166|Route 166]], where it enters the town of [[Old Saybrook, Connecticut|Old Saybrook]]. Within Old Saybrook, the road turns northeast, and has an interchange with [[Connecticut Route 154|Route 154]] northwest of Old Saybrook Center. On the east side of town, US 1 merges onto northbound I-95 and joins the route in a concurrency, as it widens to six lanes, and comes to a trumpet interchange with the southern terminus of [[Connecticut Route 9|Route 9]], which heads northwest from I-95/US 1 as a four-lane freeway parallel to the [[Connecticut River]], towards [[Greater Hartford]]. A short distance later, the two routes cross the [[Raymond E. Baldwin Bridge]], that has a fourth southbound lane, over the Connecticut River and leave both Old Saybrook and Middlesex County.<ref name=\"google\" />\n\n[[File:I-95 at I-395, East Lyme, CT.jpg|left|thumb|I-95 at the I-395 exit at the East Lyme\u2013Waterford town line]]\nOn the crossing of the Connecticut River, I-95/US 1 comes into [[Old Lyme, Connecticut|Old Lyme]], [[New London County, Connecticut|New London County]] and immediately narrows to three southbound lanes, as it reaches the interchange with [[Connecticut Route 156|Route 156]], where US 1 exits the highway and the concurrency ends. The freeway reduces to four lanes and heads into a heavily forested area with little development around the highway, where it crosses the [[Duck River (Connecticut)|Duck River]]. The road crosses the Threemile River prior to crossing the Fourmile River, within its interchange with the namesake road, as it enters the town of [[East Lyme, Connecticut|East Lyme]]. I-95 immediately comes to a trumpet interchange with the Rocky Neck Connector, that provides access to the [[Rocky Neck State Park]]. Continuing northeast through the center of East Lyme, the freeway enters into areas of mixed development with suburban elements before crossing the Pattagansett River within its interchange with [[Connecticut Route 161|Route 161]], in the village of Flanders. Shorty afterward, there is an interchange with US 1, and the road crosses the [[Niantic River]] just before meeting the southern terminus of [[Interstate 395 (Connecticut-Massachusetts)|I-395]]. Here, the Connecticut Turnpike splits to the northeast along the I-395, which heads toward [[Worcester, Massachusetts]].<ref name=\"google\" />\n\nPast I-395, the freeway becomes the Jewish War Veterans Memorial Highway and enters the town of [[Waterford, Connecticut|Waterford]]. A short distance later, the road heads into suburban-like commercial areas. I-95 interchanges with [[Connecticut Route 85|Route 85]] before entering the city of [[New London, Connecticut|New London]] as it gains a third northbound lane and a frontage road. Running north of the downtown area and the New London Waterfront District, the freeway meets [[Connecticut Route 32|Route 32]]. Past this interchange, US 1 merges onto northbound I-95, and the two routes turn east to run concurrent across the [[Gold Star Memorial Bridge]], which has ten lanes, over the [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]], where the highways come into the town of [[Groton, Connecticut|Groton]]. Before the end of the bridge, US 1 exits the highway, providing access to Downtown Groton. The freeway narrows to six lanes as it reaches an interchange with [[Connecticut Route 12|Route 12]] and the western terminus of [[Connecticut Route 184|Route 184]], which also provides access to the [[Naval Submarine Base New London]]. A short distance later, the road reverse turns through a directional interchange with the northern terminus of [[Connecticut Route 349|Route 349]], which spurs into the downtown area. Past Route 349, the median widens, after many miles of having a [[jersey barrier]] in the middle of the highway, and it heads into forested surroundings. In the eastern part of Groton, I-95 interchanges with [[Connecticut Route 117|Route 117]], leading south to the village of [[Noank, Connecticut|Noank]] and north to the town of [[Ledyard, Connecticut|Ledyard]]. From here, the freeway passes a northbound scenic overlook, and crosses the [[Mystic River (Connecticut)|Mystic River]].<ref name=\"google\" />\n\n[[File:Hoxie overlook ct.jpg|center|thumb|700px|Panoramic view from the Jerome Hoxie Scenic Overlook, March 2006]]\nUpon crossing the Mystic River, the road enters the town of [[Stonington, Connecticut|Stonington]], where it comes to an interchange with [[Connecticut Route 27|Route 27]] within the village of [[Mystic, Connecticut|Mystic]], that provides access to [[Mystic Seaport]] as well as the Olde Mistick Village shopping mall and the [[Mystic Aquarium]] located at the southeastern corner of the interchange. At this point, I-95 reduces to four lanes, and turns northeast passing wooded areas with some residences, and comes to an interchange for [[Connecticut Route 234|Route 234]] north of the center of Stonington, with a park and ride lot being located in the northwest corner of the interchange. From here, the freeway continues northeast to an interchange for [[Connecticut Route 2|Route 2]]/[[Connecticut Route 49|Route 49]], providing access to the village of [[Pawcatuck, Connecticut|Pawcatuck]] to the south and a park and ride lot to the north in the middle of the interchange. Also, within the interchange, the southbound direction has a rest area and welcome center and the road comes into the town of [[North Stonington, Connecticut|North Stonington]]. I-95 continues to its last exit in Connecticut, being the interchange with [[Connecticut Route 216|Route 216]] and the eastern terminus of Route 184, as the median narrows. Immediately after this interchange, the freeway leaves Connecticut and continues as a four-lane freeway northeast into [[Rhode Island]] towards [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]].<ref name=\"google\" />\n\n==History==\nI-95 in Connecticut has far more exits than typical Interstate Highways, particularly in Fairfield and New Haven Counties, with some exits less than one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) apart. State transportation officials have said that the reason for the many exits stems from the state's original justification for building parts of the highway\u2014to ease traffic congestion on [[U.S. Route 1 in Connecticut|US 1]] by providing a faster alternate route, even for drivers traveling short distances within the same community. To overcome potential opposition to the highway from towns through which the route would traverse, the state agreed to guarantee each affected town a certain number of access points to the highway. Rather than skirting urban areas, the highway was built directly through the most dense sections of Stamford, Norwalk, Bridgeport, and New Haven.\n\nWhile most of I-95 was built as the Connecticut Turnpike, the route incorporated several pieces of already-built relocations, some to [[freeway]] standards, of US&nbsp;1 (the turnpike split from the US 1 relocation in [[East Lyme, Connecticut|East Lyme]], along the Old Lyme-New London section):\n*[[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]] bypass, opened c. 1952\n*New Haven east of the [[Quinnipiac River]], opened c. 1951\n*[[Old Saybrook, Connecticut|Old Saybrook]]-[[Old Lyme, Connecticut|Old Lyme]], [[Raymond E. Baldwin Bridge]] over the [[Connecticut River]] and approaches, opened 1948\n*Old Lyme-New London, opened by 1950 as a two-lane road\n*New London-[[Groton, Connecticut|Groton]] [[Gold Star Memorial Bridge|Gold Star Bridge]] over the [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]] and approaches, opened 1943\nOther improvements in the corridor included the [[New York (state)|New York]]-[[Meriden, Connecticut|Meriden]] [[Merritt Parkway]]/[[Wilbur Cross Parkway]], New Haven-Old Saybrook [[Connecticut Route 80|Route 80]], and Groton-Rhode Island [[Connecticut Route 184|Route 184]], the latter connecting in Rhode Island to [[Rhode Island Route 3|Route 3]], a shortcut to [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]].\n\nMost of the turnpike opened January 2, 1958, and was designated I-95 south and west of the split with the relocated US 1 by 1959. The rest of I-95 from I-395 to the Connecticut\u2013Rhode Island border opened December 12, 1964. The Gold Star Bridge was twinned c. 1975, along with a reconstruction of its approaches, and in 1993 the Raymond E. Baldwin Bridge was replaced with a wider span.\n\nThe state installed cameras to watch traffic along the highway in the early 1990s. As of 2007, about 100 cameras have been set up and are monitored by state police and the [[Connecticut Department of Transportation]] (ConnDOT). In [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]], local emergency responders (fire departments and ambulance services) that serve the highway in individual towns have asked for direct feeds from the cameras to avoid mistakes. When travelers report an accident, they sometimes tell authorities that it occurred near an exit that is actually not the nearest to the scene, slowing down response time. The traffic feed from the cameras is available on the World Wide Web, but the service can be spotty, according to the [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] and [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] fire chiefs, who said they were hoping that a proposed $40 million upgrade of the camera system, under consideration by the state in 2007, would provide them access.<ref>{{cite news |last = Ginocchio |first = Mark |title = Local Leaders Want Access to DOT cameras |work = [[The Advocate (Stamford)|The Advocate]] |location = Stamford, Connecticut |date = July 15, 2007 |pages = A1, A6 }}</ref> Feeds from these cameras are also used by local media outlets, as part of traffic report segments in news programming, and in some instances as a part of a designated traffic and weather channel.\n\n===Disasters===\nIn January 1983, a truck with a brake failure slammed into a line of cars waiting to pay a toll on I-95 in Stratford; seven people were killed. This accident helped lead to the removal of toll barriers throughout Connecticut, which was completed six years after.\n\nOn the morning of June 28, 1983, a {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=on}} section of the [[Mianus River Bridge]] in [[Cos Cob, Connecticut|Cos Cob]] collapsed, plunging northbound I-95 traffic into the [[Mianus River]] below, killing three. The collapse was blamed on the failure of the steel pins to hold the horizontal beams together and inadequate inspection prior to the collapse. Northbound traffic was diverted on this section of I-95 for 25 days. Southbound traffic was unaffected.\n\nOn March 26, 2004, a bridge on I-95 in Bridgeport was partly melted by the explosion of a [[tanker truck]] carrying over {{convert|11,900|USgal|l}} of [[fuel oil]]. Repairs were estimated to take at least two weeks, but the highway was opened to northbound traffic in only a few days. Southbound traffic resumed about a week later after a temporary bridge was installed to carry traffic while the destroyed bridge was rebuilt.\n\nAt 10:20 a.m. on November 2, 2007, a [[tanker truck]] carrying [[heating oil]] plowed over the divider, knocking the side of a [[tractor trailer]] and striking several other cars in its path. Three people were killed, including the driver of the tanker and the occupants of two cars that were completely destroyed in the crash. The driver of the tractor trailer survived (his canine companion emerged completely unharmed) but the trailer was split open. At least three other cars were involved in this accident. A part of the road was damaged and took until the next morning to fully reopen, partly due to a cleanup after the accident.\n\n===Construction plans===\nWhile the corridor was designated \"High Priority Corridor 65\" in 2005, work along Interstate 95 in Connecticut has been ongoing for nearly 30 years.\n\nInterstate upgrades include:\n*Replace the bridge over the Connecticut River in Saybrook (completed in 1993)\n*Replace the bridge over the [[Saugatuck River]] in [[Westport, Connecticut|Westport]] (completed in 2001)\n*Widening and reconstruction of I-95 through [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]] (completed in 2006)\n*Upgrade the median divider from New York state line to [[Waterford, Connecticut|Waterford]] to meet current safety standards (segmented construction ongoing since 1993)\n*Construction of a new extradosed [[Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge (Connecticut)|Q Bridge]] (Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge) over the [[Quinnipiac River]] (completed in 2015)\n*Reconfiguring the interchange between [[Interstate 91 in Connecticut|I-91]], I-95, and [[Connecticut Route 34|Route 34]] in New Haven (completed in 2016)\n*Replace bridge over the [[West River (Connecticut)|West River]] in New Haven (completed in June 2018). Exit 44, southbound, was closed in April 2015, and the remaining ramps at Exit 45, northbound, and southbound were realigned and renumbered Exit 44.\n*Reconstruct I-95/[[Interstate 395 (Connecticut\u2013Massachusetts)|I-395]] interchange in Waterford to accommodate proposed [[Connecticut Route 11|Route 11 Expressway]] connection (proposed).\n*Replacement of the [[Moses Wheeler Bridge]] over the [[Housatonic River]] (underway)\n*Widening and reconstruction of I-95 between [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] and [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]]&nbsp;\u2014 in December 2007 a 15-month, $5.5 million project was completed to add fourth (or \"operational\") lanes in each direction between the entrances and exits at exits 10 and 11 in Darien. This project was completed in 2007. A similar project between exits 11 and 13 began in 2008 and was completed in 2010. An earlier project added a fourth lane on the southbound side from the entrance at exit 10 to exit 8. After that lane was added, a ConnDOT study concluded that accidents were down on that stretch of the highway by 20 percent, amounting to about 160 fewer accidents per year.<ref>{{cite news |last = Lucas |first = Jonathan |title = I-95 Lanes Open in Time for Holidays: Project Aims to Ease Congestion in Darien |work = The Advocate |location = Stamford, Connecticut |date = December 8, 2007 |pages = A1, A4 |edition = Norwalk }}</ref>\n*Widen I-95 mainline from Branford to the [[Rhode Island]] state line (proposed)\n*Adding an operational lane between exits 14 and 15 in Norwalk (completed in 2016)\n[[File:Connecticut Turnpike - Fairfield Service Plaza.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Fairfield Service Plaza (Southbound) in 2018]]\n*From 2011 to 2015, all 10 of the service plazas along I-95 were rebuilt (pairs of plazas are located in Darien, Fairfield, Milford, Branford, and Madison, with a separate plaza for each direction of I-95). All of the renovated plazas feature modernized Mobil gas stations, Alltown convenience stores, [[Dunkin Donuts]], and Subway shops.

The road is paralleled by [[Metro North Railroad]]'s [[New Haven Line]] to the northwest, which also carries [[Amtrak]]'s [[Northeast Corridor]], which it follows for much of its length throughout the state. I-95 heads northeast, passing through the affluent suburban development of the [[Gold Coast (Connecticut)|Gold Coast]] of southwestern Fairfield County and reaching a [[weigh station]] in the northbound direction, before turning east-northeast and passing south of downtown Greenwich. The road then heads into the neighborhood of [[Cos Cob, Connecticut|Cos Cob]] before it crosses over the New Haven Line and the [[Mianus River]], on the [[Mianus River Bridge]]. Past the river, I-95 comes to a trumpet interchange which provides access to [[U.S. Route 1 in Connecticut|US&nbsp;1]] between the neighborhoods [[Riverside, Connecticut|Riverside]] and [[Old Greenwich, Connecticut|Old Greenwich]].<ref name=\"google\">{{google maps|url=https://www.google.com/maps/dir/40.9942178,-73.6596324/I-95,+Hopkinton,+RI/@41.1714759,-74.0305229,300699m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m9!4m8!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x89e5dce33cdbbea7:0xd83da34c71662fdb!2m2!1d-71.7965657!2d41.4423122!3e0|title=overview of Interstate 95 in Connecticut|access-date=April 18, 2020}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fairfield Ave overpass 3.JPG|thumb|left|I-95 northbound in Stamford]]\nAfter this interchange, the freeway enters the city of [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] at the city's [[West Side of Stamford|West Side]]. The road crosses the [[Rippowam River]] and enters the dense commercial area of [[Downtown Stamford]], where it briefly becomes elevated and serves [[Connecticut Route 137|Route&nbsp;137]]. Upon leaving the downtown area, the freeway passes over the New Haven Line and crosses into the residential [[East Side of Stamford]], where there is an interchange with US 1 that also provides access to [[Connecticut Route 106|Route 106]]. After this point, the southbound direction gains a fourth lane as the road enters the town of [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]], where there is a service plaza in the southbound direction. In the community of [[Noroton, Connecticut|Noroton]]; the highway passes to the south of [[Noroton Heights station]] on the New Haven Line. Near the center of town, the southbound direction narrows to three lanes again, and I-95 has interchanges with US 1 and [[Connecticut Route 136|Route 136]]. Next, the freeway turns to the northeast, passing over the New Haven Line and coming to a service plaza and welcome center in the northbound direction, before reaching another interchange with US 1.<ref name=\"google\" /> \n\nImmediately after, the road comes into the city of [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] in the neighborhood of [[South Norwalk]]. The freeway turns east-northeast and passes north of [[Maritime Aquarium at Norwalk]] as it comes to an interchange with the southern terminus of [[U.S. Route 7 in Connecticut|US 7]] and crosses the [[Danbury Branch]] of the New Haven Line within the interchange, before crossing the [[Norwalk River]] on the [[Yankee Doodle Bridge]] and entering [[East Norwalk]]. I-95 enters the town of [[Westport, Connecticut|Westport]], just prior to reaching an interchange with the southern terminus [[Connecticut Route 33|Route 33]] and Route 136. Past this interchange, the freeway proceeds to cross over the [[Saugatuck River]] and continues to an interchange with the Sherwood Island Connector, which provides access to US 1 and [[Sherwood Island State Park]]. The road curves through wooded residential areas, where it comes into the town of [[Fairfield, Connecticut|Fairfield]]. Here, I-95 reaches an interchange with US 1/Center Street, which serve the neighborhood of [[Southport, Connecticut|Southport]], before crossing the [[Mill River (Fairfield, Connecticut)|Mill River]]. Passing to the north of [[Fairfield Center]], the freeway reaches a service plaza in both directions, where there also exists an interchange  with [[Connecticut Route 135|Route 135]], providing access to the main campus of [[Fairfield University]]. From this point, the road curves through an interchange with US 1 on the eastern edge of town.<ref name=\"google\" />\n\n[[File:Interstate 95 in Connecticut (26545910297).jpg|thumb|right|I-95 northbound in Bridgeport]]\nFollowing the Black Rock Turnpike, I-95 enters the city of [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], which is the largest city in the state of Connecticut. On the city's West Side, the freeway has an interchange with [[Connecticut Route 130|Route 130]], where it becomes elevated and gains a fourth southbound lane, as it passes through the industrial areas of the city's southwestern neighborhoods. Within that interchange, the road also crosses the New Haven Line. Further within the area, I-95 crosses over the New Haven Line again and passes to south of downtown Bridgeport. Here, the freeway provides access to many of the city's major landmarks in the South End and downtown area, and meets southern terminus of [[Connecticut Route 8|Route 8]] and [[Connecticut Route 25|Route 25]], which both head north from I-95 as a four-lane freeway. From this point, the road narrows to three lanes in the southbound direction, and comes onto to the [[P.T. Barnum Bridge]] which carries it over the New Haven Line, adjacent to the [[Bridgeport station (Connecticut)|Bridgeport station]], and the [[Pequonnock River]]. On the bridge, the northbound direction gains a fourth lane, as it comes to an exit for [[Connecticut Route 127|Route 127]] on Bridgeport's east side, after it passes over Route 130. I-95 reduces back to three lanes in the northbound direction, as it curves into the city's East End, where there is another interchange for Route 130. A short distance later, the freeway reaches an exit to [[Connecticut Route 113|Route 113]] on the border of [[Stratford, Connecticut|Stratford]], providing access to the [[Sikorsky Memorial Airport]]. Afterward, the road passes by downtown Stratford and heads into a commercial area, where it has an exit serving US 1 and the southern terminus of [[Connecticut Route 110|Route 110]], before crossing the [[Housatonic River]] on the [[Moses Wheeler Bridge]].<ref name=\"google\" />\n\n===New Haven County===\n\nOn the Moses Wheeler Bridge, I-95 crosses into [[Milford, Connecticut|Milford]], [[New Haven County, Connecticut|New Haven County]], where it heads into residential areas on the other side of the river. Here, the freeway has a trumpet interchange with US 1, within the village of [[Devon (Milford)|Devon]], before it crosses the New Haven Line and reaches an interchange with Schoolhouse Road/Sub Way, in which the latter road is named for the world headquarters of the [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]] restaurant chain. The road continues northeast through wooded areas of the western part of Milford, where it reaches the interchange with the [[Milford Parkway (Connecticut)|Milford Parkway]] to the northeast of Downtown Milford. The Milford Parkway, a four-lane limited access parkway, provides access from I-95, as well as US 1 to [[Merritt Parkway]] and [[Wilbur Cross Parkway]], which are both components of [[Connecticut Route 15|Route 15]]. The freeway enters a reverse turn, where it comes to a cloverleaf interchange with US 1 adjacent to the [[Connecticut Post Mall]], located at the northeastern corner of the interchange. The road heads northeast again into commercial surroundings and passes service plazas in both directions, before coming into the town of [[Orange, Connecticut|Orange]], where it reaches an interchange with Marsh Hill Road. The overpass carrying Marsh Hill Road is called the [[Salemme Memorial Bridge]], and the exit provides access to the West Campus of [[Yale University]].<ref name=\"google\" />\n\n[[File:Interstate 95 in Connecticut (40702893654).jpg|thumb|left|I-95 northbound near the interchange with I-91]]\nThe road passes to the northwest of the university campus as it enters the city of [[West Haven, Connecticut|West Haven]]. Here, I-95 passes mixed areas of suburban development, where it comes to an interchange with [[Connecticut Route 162|Route 162]]. Thru trucks to Downtown West Haven must use this exit, as trucks may not use the northbound exit ramp at the next interchange, for Campbell Avenue and the southern terminus of [[Connecticut Route 122|Route 122]], due to its steep incline. The road makes another reverse turn, where it crosses the New Haven Line and the [[West River (Connecticut)|West River]], and comes into the city of [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]]. Immediately after crossing the river, I-95 comes to an interchange with the southern terminus of [[Connecticut Route 10|Route 10]], which provides access to the [[Yale Bowl]] and connects to [[Connecticut Route 34|Route 34]]. From this point, the freeway heads northeast, passing the [[New Haven Harbor]] in the neighborhood of [[Long Wharf (New Haven)|Long Wharf]], before reaching the large interchange complex southeast of [[Downtown New Haven]]. The complex includes an interchange with a flyover ramp to M.L.K. Jr. Boulevard serving the downtown area, as well as the highway's split with [[Interstate 91|I-91]], which heads north-northeast from I-95 towards [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]]. Past I-91, the freeway turns southeast to cross the [[Quinnipiac River]] on the [[Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge (Connecticut)|Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge]], locally known as simply the \"Q Bridge\". On the other side of the bridge, the road heads into another area of mixed development in [[The Annex (New Haven)|The Annex]] neighborhood. Here, I-95, expands to four lanes in the southbound direction, and has an interchange with the northern terminus of [[Connecticut Route 337|Route 337]], that also provides access to [[Tweed New Haven Airport]].<ref name=\"google\" />\n\nPast this interchange, the freeway enters the town of [[East Haven, Connecticut|East Haven]], where US 1 parallels the highway on the both sides as a frontage road as the southbound direction narrows back to three lanes, before coming to a partial interchange with that route. Within the interchange, it also crosses the Northeast Corridor. A short distance later, there is a southbound exit and northbound entrance with [[Connecticut Route 100|Route 100]] before the road curves east across [[Saltonstall Mountain]] and [[Lake Saltonstall (Connecticut)|Lake Saltonstall]], and comes into the the town of [[Branford, Connecticut|Branford]]. Within this area, I-95 passes through the [[Stewart B. McKinney National Wildlife Refuge]] where it comes to an northbound exit and southbound entrance with the [[Branford Connector]], that connects to US 1, [[Connecticut Route 142|Route 142]], and [[Connecticut Route 146|Route 146]] near [[Short Beach]]. Just after the connector, there is a service plaza in both directions, and the freeway passes north of the center of Branford. From here, the road narrows to four lanes and continues east into more rural and wooded surroundings, coming to an interchange with US 1 on the east side of town. I-95 briefly enters a commercial area and passes north of the [[Stony Creek (Branford)|Stony Creek]] neighborhood. The freeway heads back into wooded areas as it enters the town of [[Guilford, Connecticut|Guilford]], where it comes to interchanges with US 1, [[Connecticut Route 77|Route 77]], north of Guilford Center. The road continues east across the East River marshlands, and comes into the town of [[Madison, Connecticut|Madison]] prior to crossing the Neck River. The road heads to the north of Madison Center, where it has an interchange with [[Connecticut Route 79|Route 79]] with a park and ride lot in its northeastern corner. Past Route 79, I-95 passes service plazas in both directions, and reaches an interchange with the [[Hammonasset Connector]], which provides access to [[Hammonasset Beach State Park]]. At this point, the route crosses over the [[Hammonasset River]] and leaves New Haven County.<ref name=\"google\" />\n\n===Middlesex and New London counties===\n[[File:Int95nRoadCT-Exit69-CT9n (36127776443).jpg|thumb|right|I-95 northbound in Old Saybrook]]\nUpon crossing the river, I-95 comes into [[Clinton, Connecticut|Clinton]], [[Middlesex County, Connecticut|Middlesex County]] continuing east through rural surroundings with some suburban elements. The freeway reaches an interchange with [[Connecticut Route 81|Route 81]], close to the center of town adjacent to the Clinton Crossing Premium Outlets outlet mall, to the northwest of the interchange. From here, the road makes a reverse turn across the Menunketesuck River, after which it enters the town of [[Westbrook, Connecticut|Westbrook]] and reaches an interchange with [[Connecticut Route 145|Route 145]]. At this point, I-95 makes another reverse turn before turning east again, at the interchange with [[Connecticut Route 153|Route 153]] that also provides access to the Westbrook Outlets outlet mall, just north of Westbrook Center. The freeway then reaches a pair of roadside stops, in which the northbound direction has a rest area and welcome center, and the southbound direction has access to Troop F of the [[Connecticut State Police]], just before coming to the interchange for [[Connecticut Route 166|Route 166]], where it enters the town of [[Old Saybrook, Connecticut|Old Saybrook]]. Within Old Saybrook, the road turns northeast, and has an interchange with [[Connecticut Route 154|Route 154]] northwest of Old Saybrook Center. On the east side of town, US 1 merges onto northbound I-95 and joins the route in a concurrency, as it widens to six lanes, and comes to a trumpet interchange with the southern terminus of [[Connecticut Route 9|Route 9]], which heads northwest from I-95/US 1 as a four-lane freeway parallel to the [[Connecticut River]], towards [[Greater Hartford]]. A short distance later, the two routes cross the [[Raymond E. Baldwin Bridge]], that has a fourth southbound lane, over the Connecticut River and leave both Old Saybrook and Middlesex County.<ref name=\"google\" />\n\n[[File:I-95 at I-395, East Lyme, CT.jpg|left|thumb|I-95 at the I-395 exit at the East Lyme\u2013Waterford town line]]\nOn the crossing of the Connecticut River, I-95/US 1 comes into [[Old Lyme, Connecticut|Old Lyme]], [[New London County, Connecticut|New London County]] and immediately narrows to three southbound lanes, as it reaches the interchange with [[Connecticut Route 156|Route 156]], where US 1 exits the highway and the concurrency ends. The freeway reduces to four lanes and heads into a heavily forested area with little development around the highway, where it crosses the [[Duck River (Connecticut)|Duck River]]. The road crosses the Threemile River prior to crossing the Fourmile River, within its interchange with the namesake road, as it enters the town of [[East Lyme, Connecticut|East Lyme]]. I-95 immediately comes to a trumpet interchange with the Rocky Neck Connector, that provides access to the [[Rocky Neck State Park]]. Continuing northeast through the center of East Lyme, the freeway enters into areas of mixed development with suburban elements before crossing the Pattagansett River within its interchange with [[Connecticut Route 161|Route 161]], in the village of Flanders. Shorty afterward, there is an interchange with US 1, and the road crosses the [[Niantic River]] just before meeting the southern terminus of [[Interstate 395 (Connecticut-Massachusetts)|I-395]]. Here, the Connecticut Turnpike splits to the northeast along the I-395, which heads toward [[Worcester, Massachusetts]].<ref name=\"google\" />\n\nPast I-395, the freeway becomes the Jewish War Veterans Memorial Highway and enters the town of [[Waterford, Connecticut|Waterford]]. A short distance later, the road heads into suburban-like commercial areas. I-95 interchanges with [[Connecticut Route 85|Route 85]] before entering the city of [[New London, Connecticut|New London]] as it gains a third northbound lane and a frontage road. Running north of the downtown area and the New London Waterfront District, the freeway meets [[Connecticut Route 32|Route 32]]. Past this interchange, US 1 merges onto northbound I-95, and the two routes turn east to run concurrent across the [[Gold Star Memorial Bridge]], which has ten lanes, over the [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]], where the highways come into the town of [[Groton, Connecticut|Groton]]. Before the end of the bridge, US 1 exits the highway, providing access to Downtown Groton. The freeway narrows to six lanes as it reaches an interchange with [[Connecticut Route 12|Route 12]] and the western terminus of [[Connecticut Route 184|Route 184]], which also provides access to the [[Naval Submarine Base New London]]. A short distance later, the road reverse turns through a directional interchange with the northern terminus of [[Connecticut Route 349|Route 349]], which spurs into the downtown area. Past Route 349, the median widens, after many miles of having a [[jersey barrier]] in the middle of the highway, and it heads into forested surroundings. In the eastern part of Groton, I-95 interchanges with [[Connecticut Route 117|Route 117]], leading south to the village of [[Noank, Connecticut|Noank]] and north to the town of [[Ledyard, Connecticut|Ledyard]]. From here, the freeway passes a northbound scenic overlook, and crosses the [[Mystic River (Connecticut)|Mystic River]].<ref name=\"google\" />\n\n[[File:Hoxie overlook ct.jpg|center|thumb|700px|Panoramic view from the Jerome Hoxie Scenic Overlook, March 2006]]\nUpon crossing the Mystic River, the road enters the town of [[Stonington, Connecticut|Stonington]], where it comes to an interchange with [[Connecticut Route 27|Route 27]] within the village of [[Mystic, Connecticut|Mystic]], that provides access to [[Mystic Seaport]] as well as the Olde Mistick Village shopping mall and the [[Mystic Aquarium]] located at the southeastern corner of the interchange. At this point, I-95 reduces to four lanes, and turns northeast passing wooded areas with some residences, and comes to an interchange for [[Connecticut Route 234|Route 234]] north of the center of Stonington, with a park and ride lot being located in the northwest corner of the interchange. From here, the freeway continues northeast to an interchange for [[Connecticut Route 2|Route 2]]/[[Connecticut Route 49|Route 49]], providing access to the village of [[Pawcatuck, Connecticut|Pawcatuck]] to the south and a park and ride lot to the north in the middle of the interchange. Also, within the interchange, the southbound direction has a rest area and welcome center and the road comes into the town of [[North Stonington, Connecticut|North Stonington]]. I-95 continues to its last exit in Connecticut, being the interchange with [[Connecticut Route 216|Route 216]] and the eastern terminus of Route 184, as the median narrows. Immediately after this interchange, the freeway leaves Connecticut and continues as a four-lane freeway northeast into [[Rhode Island]] towards [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]].<ref name=\"google\" />\n\n==History==\nI-95 in Connecticut has far more exits than typical Interstate Highways, particularly in Fairfield and New Haven Counties, with some exits less than one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) apart. State transportation officials have said that the reason for the many exits stems from the state's original justification for building parts of the highway\u2014to ease traffic congestion on [[U.S. Route 1 in Connecticut|US 1]] by providing a faster alternate route, even for drivers traveling short distances within the same community. To overcome potential opposition to the highway from towns through which the route would traverse, the state agreed to guarantee each affected town a certain number of access points to the highway. Rather than skirting urban areas, the highway was built directly through the most dense sections of Stamford, Norwalk, Bridgeport, and New Haven.\n\nWhile most of I-95 was built as the Connecticut Turnpike, the route incorporated several pieces of already-built relocations, some to [[freeway]] standards, of US&nbsp;1 (the turnpike split from the US 1 relocation in [[East Lyme, Connecticut|East Lyme]], along the Old Lyme-New London section):\n*[[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]] bypass, opened c. 1952\n*New Haven east of the [[Quinnipiac River]], opened c. 1951\n*[[Old Saybrook, Connecticut|Old Saybrook]]-[[Old Lyme, Connecticut|Old Lyme]], [[Raymond E. Baldwin Bridge]] over the [[Connecticut River]] and approaches, opened 1948\n*Old Lyme-New London, opened by 1950 as a two-lane road\n*New London-[[Groton, Connecticut|Groton]] [[Gold Star Memorial Bridge|Gold Star Bridge]] over the [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]] and approaches, opened 1943\nOther improvements in the corridor included the [[New York (state)|New York]]-[[Meriden, Connecticut|Meriden]] [[Merritt Parkway]]/[[Wilbur Cross Parkway]], New Haven-Old Saybrook [[Connecticut Route 80|Route 80]], and Groton-Rhode Island [[Connecticut Route 184|Route 184]], the latter connecting in Rhode Island to [[Rhode Island Route 3|Route 3]], a shortcut to [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]].\n\nMost of the turnpike opened January 2, 1958, and was designated I-95 south and west of the split with the relocated US 1 by 1959. The rest of I-95 from I-395 to the Connecticut\u2013Rhode Island border opened December 12, 1964. The Gold Star Bridge was twinned c. 1975, along with a reconstruction of its approaches, and in 1993 the Raymond E. Baldwin Bridge was replaced with a wider span.\n\nThe state installed cameras to watch traffic along the highway in the early 1990s. As of 2007, about 100 cameras have been set up and are monitored by state police and the [[Connecticut Department of Transportation]] (ConnDOT). In [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]], local emergency responders (fire departments and ambulance services) that serve the highway in individual towns have asked for direct feeds from the cameras to avoid mistakes. When travelers report an accident, they sometimes tell authorities that it occurred near an exit that is actually not the nearest to the scene, slowing down response time. The traffic feed from the cameras is available on the World Wide Web, but the service can be spotty, according to the [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] and [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] fire chiefs, who said they were hoping that a proposed $40 million upgrade of the camera system, under consideration by the state in 2007, would provide them access.<ref>{{cite news |last = Ginocchio |first = Mark |title = Local Leaders Want Access to DOT cameras |work = [[The Advocate (Stamford)|The Advocate]] |location = Stamford, Connecticut |date = July 15, 2007 |pages = A1, A6 }}</ref> Feeds from these cameras are also used by local media outlets, as part of traffic report segments in news programming, and in some instances as a part of a designated traffic and weather channel.\n\n===Disasters===\nIn January 1983, a truck with a brake failure slammed into a line of cars waiting to pay a toll on I-95 in Stratford; seven people were killed. This accident helped lead to the removal of toll barriers throughout Connecticut, which was completed six years after.\n\nOn the morning of June 28, 1983, a {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=on}} section of the [[Mianus River Bridge]] in [[Cos Cob, Connecticut|Cos Cob]] collapsed, plunging northbound I-95 traffic into the [[Mianus River]] below, killing three. The collapse was blamed on the failure of the steel pins to hold the horizontal beams together and inadequate inspection prior to the collapse. Northbound traffic was diverted on this section of I-95 for 25 days. Southbound traffic was unaffected.\n\nOn March 26, 2004, a bridge on I-95 in Bridgeport was partly melted by the explosion of a [[tanker truck]] carrying over {{convert|11,900|USgal|l}} of [[fuel oil]]. Repairs were estimated to take at least two weeks, but the highway was opened to northbound traffic in only a few days. Southbound traffic resumed about a week later after a temporary bridge was installed to carry traffic while the destroyed bridge was rebuilt.\n\nAt 10:20 a.m. on November 2, 2007, a [[tanker truck]] carrying [[heating oil]] plowed over the divider, knocking the side of a [[tractor trailer]] and striking several other cars in its path. Three people were killed, including the driver of the tanker and the occupants of two cars that were completely destroyed in the crash. The driver of the tractor trailer survived (his canine companion emerged completely unharmed) but the trailer was split open. At least three other cars were involved in this accident. A part of the road was damaged and took until the next morning to fully reopen, partly due to a cleanup after the accident.\n\n===Construction plans===\nWhile the corridor was designated \"High Priority Corridor 65\" in 2005, work along Interstate 95 in Connecticut has been ongoing for nearly 30 years.\n\nInterstate upgrades include:\n*Replace the bridge over the Connecticut River in Saybrook (completed in 1993)\n*Replace the bridge over the [[Saugatuck River]] in [[Westport, Connecticut|Westport]] (completed in 2001)\n*Widening and reconstruction of I-95 through [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]] (completed in 2006)\n*Upgrade the median divider from New York state line to [[Waterford, Connecticut|Waterford]] to meet current safety standards (segmented construction ongoing since 1993)\n*Construction of a new extradosed [[Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge (Connecticut)|Q Bridge]] (Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge) over the [[Quinnipiac River]] (completed in 2015)\n*Reconfiguring the interchange between [[Interstate 91 in Connecticut|I-91]], I-95, and [[Connecticut Route 34|Route 34]] in New Haven (completed in 2016)\n*Replace bridge over the [[West River (Connecticut)|West River]] in New Haven (completed in June 2018). Exit 44, southbound, was closed in April 2015, and the remaining ramps at Exit 45, northbound, and southbound were realigned and renumbered Exit 44.\n*Reconstruct I-95/[[Interstate 395 (Connecticut\u2013Massachusetts)|I-395]] interchange in Waterford to accommodate proposed [[Connecticut Route 11|Route 11 Expressway]] connection (proposed).\n*Replacement of the [[Moses Wheeler Bridge]] over the [[Housatonic River]] (underway)\n*Widening and reconstruction of I-95 between [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] and [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]]&nbsp;\u2014 in December 2007 a 15-month, $5.5 million project was completed to add fourth (or \"operational\") lanes in each direction between the entrances and exits at exits 10 and 11 in Darien. This project was completed in 2007. A similar project between exits 11 and 13 began in 2008 and was completed in 2010. An earlier project added a fourth lane on the southbound side from the entrance at exit 10 to exit 8. After that lane was added, a ConnDOT study concluded that accidents were down on that stretch of the highway by 20 percent, amounting to about 160 fewer accidents per year.<ref>{{cite news |last = Lucas |first = Jonathan |title = I-95 Lanes Open in Time for Holidays: Project Aims to Ease Congestion in Darien |work = The Advocate |location = Stamford, Connecticut |date = December 8, 2007 |pages = A1, A4 |edition = Norwalk }}</ref>\n*Widen I-95 mainline from Branford to the [[Rhode Island]] state line (proposed)\n*Adding an operational lane between exits 14 and 15 in Norwalk (completed in 2016)\n[[File:Connecticut Turnpike - Fairfield Service Plaza.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Fairfield Service Plaza (Southbound) in 2018]]\n*From 2011 to 2015, all 10 of the service plazas along I-95 were rebuilt (pairs of plazas are located in Darien, Fairfield, Milford, Branford, and Madison, with a separate plaza for each direction of I-95). All of the renovated plazas feature modernized Mobil gas stations, Alltown convenience stores, [[Dunkin Donuts]], and Subway shops. [[McDonald's]] is also available at eight of the ten plazas, while the largest plazas additionally feature [[Sbarro]], [[Panda Express]] and various other quick-service options. The last of the plazas to be rebuilt, southbound in Madison, opened in August 2015.\n\nMass transit upgrade projects have been undertaken in large part to reduce traffic on the highway, which is often congested, particularly in Fairfield County:\n*New [[Fairfield Metro (Metro-North station)|train station]] near the [[Fairfield, Connecticut|Fairfield]]\u2013Bridgeport city line (completed in 2011, fully operational in January 2012)\n*Intermodal Transportation Center in Bridgeport (completed)\n*New [[West Haven (Metro-North station)|train station]] in [[West Haven, Connecticut|West Haven]] (completed)\n*Upgrade [[overhead lines|catenary power lines]] along the New Haven Line (underway through the 2010s)\n*New [[Madison (Shore Line East station)|train station]] in [[Madison, Connecticut|Madison]] (completed)\n*Purchase new [[railroad car]]s and refurbish existing cars to increase capacity and reliability\n*Construct new [[Intermodal container|container]] [[barge]] ports at Bridgeport and New Haven\n*Expansion of [[Freight train|freight]] service on the New Haven Line\n*Replace outdated bridges and straighten various sections of the New Haven Line to allow higher operating speeds for [[Amtrak]] and Metro-North trains\n\n==Exit list==\nExit numbers are currently sequential, but will be changed to mileage-based in the future.\n{{jcttop|exit|length_ref=}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|county=Fairfield\n|cspan=45\n|location=Byram\n|lspan=3\n|mile=0.00\n|exit=\u2013\n|road={{jct|state=NY|I|95|dir1=south|name1=[[New England Thruway]]|city1=New York City}}\n|notes=Continuation into [[New York (state)|New York]]\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|mile=0.80\n|exit=2\n|road=Delavan Avenue \u2013 [[Byram, Connecticut|Byram]]\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|mile=2.00\n|type=closed\n|place=Former toll plaza\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|location=Greenwich\n|area=CDP\n|mile=2.54\n|exit=3\n|road=Arch Street \u2013 [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|location=Cos Cob\n|mile=3.73\n|exit=4\n|road=Indian Field Road \u2013 [[Cos Cob, Connecticut|Cos Cob]], [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]\n}}\n{{jctbridge|exit|state=CT\n|location=Greenwich\n|area=town\n|mile=4.35\n|mile2=4.85\n|bridge=[[Mianus River Bridge]] over the [[Mianus River]]\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|location=Riverside\n|mile=5.53\n|exit=5\n|road={{jct|state=CT|US|1|city1=Riverside|city2=Old Greenwich|city3=Mianus}}\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|location=Stamford\n|lspan=4\n|mile=6.50\n|mile2=6.62\n|exit=6\n|road=Harvard Avenue<hr>West Avenue \n|notes=Northbound exit and southbound entrance<hr>Southbound exit and northbound entrance}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|type=incomplete\n|mile=7.34\n|exit=7\n|road={{jct|state=CT|to1=To|Route|137|dir1=North|road=Greenwich Avenue}}\n|notes=Access via Washington Boulevard ([[Special Service Road 493 (Connecticut)|SSR 493]]);

For the first time, an [[upper house]] came into existence in Thailand. The Senate was to be fully elected, however, the elections would be indirect, as the [[House of Representatives of Thailand|House of Representatives]] would elect the senators, for six-year terms. The 1946 Constitution was soon abrogated in a military coup.

With most of the original refugees still living in the camps, the situation is among the most protracted in the world.<ref name=\"unhcr_2010\"/><ref name=\"hrw_2008\"/>\n\nThe limited opportunities for self-reliance in the harsh [[desert]] environment have forced the refugees to rely on international [[humanitarian aid|humanitarian assistance]] for their survival.<ref name=\"wfp_2010\"/> However, the Tindouf camps differ from the majority of refugee camps in the level of self-organization. Most affairs and camp life organization is run by the refugees themselves, with little outside interference.<ref name=\"fmo_2004_c\"/>\n\nThe camps are divided into five {{lang|ar-Latn|[[wilaya]]t}} (districts) named after towns in Western Sahara; Laayoune, Awserd, Smara, Dakhla and more recently Cape Bojador (or the [[da\u00efra of Algeria|daira]] of Bojador).<ref name=\"arso_1995\"/> In addition comes the smaller satellite camp \"February 27\", surrounding the [[boarding school]] for women, and the administrative camp Rabouni.<ref name=\"fmo_2005_b\"/> The encampments are spread out over a quite large area. While Laayoune, Smara, Awserd, February 27 and Rabouni all lie within an hour's drive of the Algerian city of [[Tindouf]], the Dakhla camp lies 170&nbsp;km to the southeast. The camps are also the headquarters of the 6th military region of the [[Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic]].\n\n== Administration and public service institutions ==\n{{Sahara conflict}}\n\nThe refugee camps are governed by [[Polisario]], being administratively part of the [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic]] (SADR). SADR's [[government in exile]] and administration are located in the Rabouni camp.<ref name=\"hrw_2008\"/>\nThe Tindouf camps are divided into administrative sub-units electing their own officials to represent the neighbourhoods in political decision-making. Each of the four ''[[wilaya]]s'' (districts) are divided into six or seven ''[[da\u00efra]]s'' (villages),<ref name=\"arso_1995\"/> which are in turn divided into ''hay''s or ''[[barrio]]s'' (neighborhoods).<ref name=\"arso_1995\"/>\n\nLocal committees distribute basic goods, water and food, while \"da\u00efra\" authorities made up by the representatives of the \"hays\" organize schools, cultural activities and medical services. Some argue that this results in a form of basic [[democracy]] on the level of camp administration, and that this has improved the efficiency of aid distribution.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Women are active on several levels of administration, and [[UNHCR]] has appraised their importance in camp administration and social structures.<ref name=\"unhcr_2006\"/>\n\nAccording to Polisario, Algeria does not intervene in their organization, treating the area as effectively under Sahrawi self-rule, though statements by former Polisario responsibles contradict that.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} While the Algerian military has a significant presence in the nearby city of Tindouf, Algeria insists that responsibility for human rights in the camps lies with the Polisario.<ref name=\"hrw_2008\"/>\n\nCamp residents are subject to the constitution and laws of SADR.

During the war years, at least some women were enrolled in auxiliary units guarding the refugee camps.\n\n== Population numbers ==\n{{main|Sahrawi refugees}}\n\nThe number of Sahrawi refugees in Tindouf camps is disputed and politically sensitive. [[Morocco]] argues that Polisario and Algeria overestimate the numbers to attract political attention and foreign aid, while Polisario accuses Morocco of attempting to restrict human aid as a means of pressure on civilian refugee populations. The refugees' numbers will also be important in determining their political weight in the possible event of a [[referendum]] to determine Western Sahara's future status.\n\nAlgerian authorities have estimated the number of Sahrawi refugees in Algeria to be 165,000. This has been supported by Polisario, although the movement recognizes that some refugees have rebased to Mauritania, a country that houses about 26,000 Sahrawis refugees.<ref name=\"uscri_2009\"/><ref name=\"unhcr_2009_mauritania\"/> [[UNHCR]] referred to Algeria's figure for many years, but in 2005 concern about it being inflated led the organization to reduce its working figure to 90,000 based on satellite imagery analysis.<ref name=\"unhcr_2010\"/><ref name=\"ussd_2007\"/> UNHCR is in dialogue with the Algerian Government and the Sahrawi refugee leadership, seeking to conduct a [[census]] to determine the exact number of refugees in the camps.<ref name=\"unhcr_2010\"/>\n\nIn 1998, UN's [[Minurso]] mission identified 42,378 voting-age adults in the camps, counting only those who had contacted the mission's registration offices and subsequently been able to prove their descent from pre-1975 Western Sahara. No attempt was made to estimate the total population number in the camps.<ref name=\"minurso\"/>\n\nThe Moroccan government contends that the total number of refugees is around 45,000 to 50,000, and also that these people are kept in the camps by Polisario against their will.<ref name=\"ecoi_2008\"/>However, the Central Intelligence Agency notes that there are about 100,00 refugees in Algerian sponsored camps near the town of Tindouf in alone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ag.html|title=Africa :: Algeria \u2014 The World Factbook - Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref> \n\n== Conditions of life ==\n[[File:Efectos de las lluvias de febrero de 2006 en el campamento 27 de febrero.jpg|thumb|300px|View of the 27 February camp after the floods that devastated the camps in February 2006]]\n[[File:Saharawi refugee women with flour in Dakhla, Algeria.jpg|thumb|right|300px|\"[[USAID]]-supplied bread flour being distributed to mothers and children in [[Dakhla, Western Sahara|Dakhla]] refugee camp.

Summer temperatures in this part of the ''hammada'', historically known as \"The Devil's Garden\", are often above {{gaps|50|\u00b0C}} and frequent sand storms disrupt normal life. There is little or no vegetation, and firewood has to be gathered by car tens of kilometers away. Only a few of the camps have access to water, and the drinking sources are neither clean nor sufficient for the entire refugee population. Basic life cannot be sustained in this environment, and the camps are completely dependent on foreign aid.\n\nFood, drinking water, building materials and clothing are brought in by car by international aid agencies.<ref name=\"hrw_2008\"/> Basic food is brought in from the port of Oran to Rabouni by the [[World Food Programme]] (WFP) in collaboration with [[Algerian Red Crescent Society|Algerian Red Crescent]] (ARC) and the Algerian government, while food distribution from Rabouni is organized by Polisario in collaboration with [[Sahrawi Red Crescent|Western Sahara Red Crescent]] (WSRC).<ref name=\"wfp_2010\"/> With the rise of a basic market economy, some refugees have been able to acquire television sets and use cars; several hundred [[satellite dish]]es have popped up in recent years.\n\nThe refugee population is plagued by the lack of vegetables, nutritious food and medicines. According to the [[United Nations]] and the [[World Food Program]], 40% of the children suffer from lack of iron, and 10% of the children below five years of age suffer from acute lack of nutrition. 32% are suffering from chronic lack of nutrition. 47% of the women suffer from lack of iron.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nHeavy flash rains and floods destroyed much of the camps in February 2006, prompting a crisis response from the [[UNHCR]] and the World Food Program (WFP), to replace destroyed housing with tents and provide food to cover for lost storages.<ref name=\"wfp_2006\"/>\n\nThe WFP has repeatedly expressed its concern over a shortage of donations, and warned of dire health consequences if needs are not met.<ref name=\"wfp_2006-11-13\"/><ref name=\"wfp_2006-10-26\"/> The UNHCR warned in early 2007 that demands were not being met in the Sahrawi camps, and that malnutrition was severe.<ref name=\"unhcr_2007\"/> Refugees International has noted that the situation is especially precarious in Dakhla, the most inaccessible of the camps.<ref name=\"refint\"/>\n\nIn October 2015, heavy rainfalls flooded the refugee camps again, destroying houses (made of sand-bricks), tents and food provisions.

The return of large numbers of Sahrawi men since the cease fire in 1991 may have slowed this development according to some observers, but women still run a majority of the camps' administration,<ref name=\"unhcr_2006\"/> and the Sahrawi women's union [[UNMS]] is very active in promoting their role.\n\nTwo women who had been residents of the camps however claimed that women in the refugee camps are deprived of their fundamental rights and are victims of exclusion and sexual aggression.<ref name=\"menara.ma\"/>\n\n== Work and economy ==\n\nWhile there are several international organizations ([[ECHO (European Commission)|ECHO]], [[WFP]], [[Oxfam]], [[UNHCR]] etc.) working in the camps, the Polisario has insisted on using mainly local staff for construction, teaching etc.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} It argues that this will help activate the refugee population, to avoid a sense of stagnation and hopelessness after 30 years in exile.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} However, jobs remain scarce and those Sahrawis educated at universities abroad can rarely if ever find opportunities to use their skills.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} Some Sahrawis work in nearby Tindouf city.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nA simple monetary economy began developing in the camps during the 1990s, after Spain decided to pay pensions to [[Sahrawis]] who had been forcibly drafted as soldiers in the ''Tropas N\u00f3madas'' during the [[Colonialism|colonial]] time. Money also came from Sahrawis working in Algeria or abroad, and from refugees who pursue a traditional [[bedouin]] and tuareg lifestyle, herding cattle in Algeria, [[Mauritania]] and the Polisario-held areas of Western Sahara. The private economy however remains very limited, and the camps continue to survive mainly on foreign and Algerian aid.<ref name=\"fmo_2004_n\"/>\n\n== Family separation and human rights ==\n\nSince the Polisario Front and Morocco are still at war, visits between the camps and the Moroccan-controlled parts of Western Sahara are virtually impossible, with the [[Moroccan Wall]] hindering movement through Western Sahara, and the Algerian-Moroccan border closed added to the restriction on movement by the Polisario on the camps population. Thousands of families have been separated for up to 30 years, a painful situation for the population in both Western Sahara and the refugee camps. In 2004, [[UNHCR]] managed a family visits exchange program for five-day visits for a limited number of people, going from the camps to the Moroccan-held territories and vice versa.<ref name=\"un_2004\"/> The [[United Nations]] has also established telephone and mail services between the camps and Moroccan-held Western Sahara.<ref name=\"un_2003\"/>\n\nWhile Polisario complains of [[Independence Intifada (Western Sahara)|repression]] of Sahrawi [[human rights]] activists in the Moroccan-held parts of Western Sahara; the government of Morocco, dissident [[Front Polisario Khat al-Shahid|groups]] inside Polisario, as well as [[former members of Polisario]], have claimed that the refugee camps occasionally are the scene of [[human rights]] abuse against the refugee population by the Polisario.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nThe Polisario Front has acknowledged reports of mistreatment in the seventies and eighties, but deny the accusations of on-going abuse. Reports of beatings and torture, in many cases leading to death, of Moroccan [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] who were formerly held in the camps were backed by some human rights organizations, which seems to have contributed to the release of the last of these prisoners by the summer of 2005. There are complaints of limitations on movement between the camps, with Morocco describing them as completely shut off from the outside world, but camp authorities maintain that this is untrue, and that they are simply engaged in registering movements for aid allocation purposes. Visiting human rights organizations have concluded that the conditions are troublesome with regard to basic subsistence, but that the human rights situation is satisfactory.<ref name=\"hrw_2008\"/><ref name=\"claihr_1997\"/><ref name=\"hrw_1995\"/> An [[OHCHR]] (United Nations' human rights monitors) visit to both Moroccan-controlled Western Sahara and the Tindouf refugee camps in 2006 documented no complaints of human rights abuse in the camps, but stressed the need for more information. However, the report, which severely criticized Moroccan conduct in Western Sahara, was slammed as biased and partisan by the Moroccan government.<ref name=\"arso_2006\"/> In April 2010, the Sahrawi government had called the UN to supervise human rights in the liberated territories and refugee camps, stating that \"We are ready to fully cooperate with UN human rights observers in the territory under our control. The United Nations should take this proposal seriously, and ask Morocco to do likewise\".<ref name=\"sps_2010\"/>\n\n==2011 NGO foreign workers abduction==\nOn 23 October 2011, three European humanitarian aid workers were kidnapped in the Rabuni, the administrative center of the refugee camps.

Algeria}}\n[[File:ElAiounrefugeecamp.jpg|thumb|300px|El-Aai\u00fan refugee camp.]]\nThe '''Sahrawi refugee camps''' in Tindouf, Algeria, are a collection of [[refugee camp]]s set up in the [[Tindouf Province]], [[Algeria]] in 1975\u201376 for [[Sahrawi people|Sahrawi]] refugees fleeing from [[Royal Moroccan Armed Forces|Moroccan forces]], who advanced through [[Western Sahara]] during the [[Western Sahara War]]. With most of the original refugees still living in the camps, the situation is among the most protracted in the world.<ref name=\"unhcr_2010\"/><ref name=\"hrw_2008\"/>\n\nThe limited opportunities for self-reliance in the harsh [[desert]] environment have forced the refugees to rely on international [[humanitarian aid|humanitarian assistance]] for their survival.<ref name=\"wfp_2010\"/> However, the Tindouf camps differ from the majority of refugee camps in the level of self-organization. Most affairs and camp life organization is run by the refugees themselves, with little outside interference.<ref name=\"fmo_2004_c\"/>\n\nThe camps are divided into five {{lang|ar-Latn|[[wilaya]]t}} (districts) named after towns in Western Sahara; Laayoune, Awserd, Smara, Dakhla and more recently Cape Bojador (or the [[da\u00efra of Algeria|daira]] of Bojador).<ref name=\"arso_1995\"/> In addition comes the smaller satellite camp \"February 27\", surrounding the [[boarding school]] for women, and the administrative camp Rabouni.<ref name=\"fmo_2005_b\"/> The encampments are spread out over a quite large area. While Laayoune, Smara, Awserd, February 27 and Rabouni all lie within an hour's drive of the Algerian city of [[Tindouf]], the Dakhla camp lies 170&nbsp;km to the southeast. The camps are also the headquarters of the 6th military region of the [[Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic]].\n\n== Administration and public service institutions ==\n{{Sahara conflict}}\n\nThe refugee camps are governed by [[Polisario]], being administratively part of the [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic]] (SADR). SADR's [[government in exile]] and administration are located in the Rabouni camp.<ref name=\"hrw_2008\"/>\nThe Tindouf camps are divided into administrative sub-units electing their own officials to represent the neighbourhoods in political decision-making. Each of the four ''[[wilaya]]s'' (districts) are divided into six or seven ''[[da\u00efra]]s'' (villages),<ref name=\"arso_1995\"/> which are in turn divided into ''hay''s or ''[[barrio]]s'' (neighborhoods).<ref name=\"arso_1995\"/>\n\nLocal committees distribute basic goods, water and food, while \"da\u00efra\" authorities made up by the representatives of the \"hays\" organize schools, cultural activities and medical services. Some argue that this results in a form of basic [[democracy]] on the level of camp administration, and that this has improved the efficiency of aid distribution.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Women are active on several levels of administration, and [[UNHCR]] has appraised their importance in camp administration and social structures.<ref name=\"unhcr_2006\"/>\n\nAccording to Polisario, Algeria does not intervene in their organization, treating the area as effectively under Sahrawi self-rule, though statements by former Polisario responsibles contradict that.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} While the Algerian military has a significant presence in the nearby city of Tindouf, Algeria insists that responsibility for human rights in the camps lies with the Polisario.<ref name=\"hrw_2008\"/>\n\nCamp residents are subject to the constitution and laws of SADR. A local justice system, with [[court]]s and [[prison]]s, is administered by Polisario. Local [[qadi]]s ([[sharia]] judges) have jurisdiction over personal status and family law issues.<ref name=\"hrw_2008\"/>\n\nPolisario has prioritised education from the beginning,<ref name=\"fmo_2005_b\"/> and the local authorities have established 29 [[preschool]]s, 31 [[primary school|primary]] and seven [[secondary school]]s, the academic institutions of \u201827 February\u2019 and \u201812 October\u2019 as well as various technical training centres ( without forgetting that Tindouf campements count 90.000 refugees) .<ref name=\"wfp_2010\"/> While teaching materials are still scarce, the literacy rate has increased from about 5% at the formation of the camps to 90% in 1995.<ref name=\"arso_1995\"/> Children's education is obligatory,<ref name=\"fmo_2005_b\"/> and several thousands have received university educations in [[Algeria]], [[Cuba]]<ref name=\"arso_2005\"/> and Spain as part of aid packages.\n\nOne former camp resident claimed to have been forcefully sent as a child to an indoctrination camp in Cuba, where he was taught to  use firearms.<ref name=\"menara.ma\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.menara.ma/fr/2013/03/08/525376-des-femmes-sahraouies-d%C3%A9noncent-au-parlement-europ%C3%A9en-les-conditions-de-vie-inhumaines-dans-les-camps-de-tindouf.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-09-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140915004632/http://www.menara.ma/fr/2013/03/08/525376-des-femmes-sahraouies-d%C3%A9noncent-au-parlement-europ%C3%A9en-les-conditions-de-vie-inhumaines-dans-les-camps-de-tindouf.html |archive-date=2014-09-15 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe camps have 27 [[clinic]]s, a central hospital and four regional hospitals.<ref name=\"wfp_2010\"/>\n\nMen perform military service in the armed forces of the SADR. During the war years, at least some women were enrolled in auxiliary units guarding the refugee camps.\n\n== Population numbers ==\n{{main|Sahrawi refugees}}\n\nThe number of Sahrawi refugees in Tindouf camps is disputed and politically sensitive. [[Morocco]] argues that Polisario and Algeria overestimate the numbers to attract political attention and foreign aid, while Polisario accuses Morocco of attempting to restrict human aid as a means of pressure on civilian refugee populations. The refugees' numbers will also be important in determining their political weight in the possible event of a [[referendum]] to determine Western Sahara's future status.\n\nAlgerian authorities have estimated the number of Sahrawi refugees in Algeria to be 165,000. This has been supported by Polisario, although the movement recognizes that some refugees have rebased to Mauritania, a country that houses about 26,000 Sahrawis refugees.<ref name=\"uscri_2009\"/><ref name=\"unhcr_2009_mauritania\"/> [[UNHCR]] referred to Algeria's figure for many years, but in 2005 concern about it being inflated led the organization to reduce its working figure to 90,000 based on satellite imagery analysis.<ref name=\"unhcr_2010\"/><ref name=\"ussd_2007\"/> UNHCR is in dialogue with the Algerian Government and the Sahrawi refugee leadership, seeking to conduct a [[census]] to determine the exact number of refugees in the camps.<ref name=\"unhcr_2010\"/>\n\nIn 1998, UN's [[Minurso]] mission identified 42,378 voting-age adults in the camps, counting only those who had contacted the mission's registration offices and subsequently been able to prove their descent from pre-1975 Western Sahara. No attempt was made to estimate the total population number in the camps.<ref name=\"minurso\"/>\n\nThe Moroccan government contends that the total number of refugees is around 45,000 to 50,000, and also that these people are kept in the camps by Polisario against their will.<ref name=\"ecoi_2008\"/>However, the the Central Intelligence Agency notes that there are about 100,00 refugees in Algerian sponsored camps near the town of Tindouf in alone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ag.html|title=Africa :: Algeria \u2014 The World Factbook - Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref> \n\n== Conditions of life ==\n[[File:Efectos de las lluvias de febrero de 2006 en el campamento 27 de febrero.jpg|thumb|300px|View of the 27 February camp after the floods that devastated the camps in February 2006]]\n[[File:Saharawi refugee women with flour in Dakhla, Algeria.jpg|thumb|right|300px|\"[[USAID]]-supplied bread flour being distributed to mothers and children in [[Dakhla, Western Sahara|Dakhla]] refugee camp. (January 18\u201325, 2004)]]\n\nThe Tindouf area is located on the ''hammada'', a vast desert plain of the [[Sahara Desert]]. Summer temperatures in this part of the ''hammada'', historically known as \"The Devil's Garden\", are often above {{gaps|50|\u00b0C}} and frequent sand storms disrupt normal life. There is little or no vegetation, and firewood has to be gathered by car tens of kilometers away. Only a few of the camps have access to water, and the drinking sources are neither clean nor sufficient for the entire refugee population. Basic life cannot be sustained in this environment, and the camps are completely dependent on foreign aid.\n\nFood, drinking water, building materials and clothing are brought in by car by international aid agencies.<ref name=\"hrw_2008\"/> Basic food is brought in from the port of Oran to Rabouni by the [[World Food Programme]] (WFP) in collaboration with [[Algerian Red Crescent Society|Algerian Red Crescent]] (ARC) and the Algerian government, while food distribution from Rabouni is organized by Polisario in collaboration with [[Sahrawi Red Crescent|Western Sahara Red Crescent]] (WSRC).<ref name=\"wfp_2010\"/> With the rise of a basic market economy, some refugees have been able to acquire television sets and use cars; several hundred [[satellite dish]]es have popped up in recent years.\n\nThe refugee population is plagued by the lack of vegetables, nutritious food and medicines. According to the [[United Nations]] and the [[World Food Program]], 40% of the children suffer from lack of iron, and 10% of the children below five years of age suffer from acute lack of nutrition. 32% are suffering from chronic lack of nutrition. 47% of the women suffer from lack of iron.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nHeavy flash rains and floods destroyed much of the camps in February 2006, prompting a crisis response from the [[UNHCR]] and the World Food Program (WFP), to replace destroyed housing with tents and provide food to cover for lost storages.<ref name=\"wfp_2006\"/>\n\nThe WFP has repeatedly expressed its concern over a shortage of donations, and warned of dire health consequences if needs are not met.<ref name=\"wfp_2006-11-13\"/><ref name=\"wfp_2006-10-26\"/> The UNHCR warned in early 2007 that demands were not being met in the Sahrawi camps, and that malnutrition was severe.<ref name=\"unhcr_2007\"/> Refugees International has noted that the situation is especially precarious in Dakhla, the most inaccessible of the camps.<ref name=\"refint\"/>\n\nIn October 2015, heavy rainfalls flooded the refugee camps again, destroying houses (made of sand-bricks), tents and food provisions.

The return of large numbers of Sahrawi men since the cease fire in 1991 may have slowed this development according to some observers, but women still run a majority of the camps' administration,<ref name=\"unhcr_2006\"/> and the Sahrawi women's union [[UNMS]] is very active in promoting their role.\n\nTwo women who had been residents of the camps however claimed that women in the refugee camps are deprived of their fundamental rights and are victims of exclusion and sexual aggression.<ref name=\"menara.ma\"/>\n\n== Work and economy ==\n\nWhile there are several international organizations ([[ECHO (European Commission)|ECHO]], [[WFP]], [[Oxfam]], [[UNHCR]] etc.) working in the camps, the Polisario has insisted on using mainly local staff for construction, teaching etc.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} It argues that this will help activate the refugee population, to avoid a sense of stagnation and hopelessness after 30 years in exile.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} However, jobs remain scarce and those Sahrawis educated at universities abroad can rarely if ever find opportunities to use their skills.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} Some Sahrawis work in nearby Tindouf city.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nA simple monetary economy began developing in the camps during the 1990s, after Spain decided to pay pensions to [[Sahrawis]] who had been forcibly drafted as soldiers in the ''Tropas N\u00f3madas'' during the [[Colonialism|colonial]] time. Money also came from Sahrawis working in Algeria or abroad, and from refugees who pursue a traditional [[bedouin]] and tuareg lifestyle, herding cattle in Algeria, [[Mauritania]] and the Polisario-held areas of Western Sahara. The private economy however remains very limited, and the camps continue to survive mainly on foreign and Algerian aid.<ref name=\"fmo_2004_n\"/>\n\n== Family separation and human rights ==\n\nSince the Polisario Front and Morocco are still at war, visits between the camps and the Moroccan-controlled parts of Western Sahara are virtually impossible, with the [[Moroccan Wall]] hindering movement through Western Sahara, and the Algerian-Moroccan border closed added to the restriction on movement by the Polisario on the camps population. Thousands of families have been separated for up to 30 years, a painful situation for the population in both Western Sahara and the refugee camps. In 2004, [[UNHCR]] managed a family visits exchange program for five-day visits for a limited number of people, going from the camps to the Moroccan-held territories and vice versa.<ref name=\"un_2004\"/> The [[United Nations]] has also established telephone and mail services between the camps and Moroccan-held Western Sahara.<ref name=\"un_2003\"/>\n\nWhile Polisario complains of [[Independence Intifada (Western Sahara)|repression]] of Sahrawi [[human rights]] activists in the Moroccan-held parts of Western Sahara; the government of Morocco, dissident [[Front Polisario Khat al-Shahid|groups]] inside Polisario, as well as [[former members of Polisario]], have claimed that the refugee camps occasionally are the scene of [[human rights]] abuse against the refugee population by the Polisario.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nThe Polisario Front has acknowledged reports of mistreatment in the seventies and eighties, but deny the accusations of on-going abuse. Reports of beatings and torture, in many cases leading to death, of Moroccan [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] who were formerly held in the camps were backed by some human rights organizations, which seems to have contributed to the release of the last of these prisoners by the summer of 2005. There are complaints of limitations on movement between the camps, with Morocco describing them as completely shut off from the outside world, but camp authorities maintain that this is untrue, and that they are simply engaged in registering movements for aid allocation purposes. Visiting human rights organizations have concluded that the conditions are troublesome with regard to basic subsistence, but that the human rights situation is satisfactory.<ref name=\"hrw_2008\"/><ref name=\"claihr_1997\"/><ref name=\"hrw_1995\"/> An [[OHCHR]] (United Nations' human rights monitors) visit to both Moroccan-controlled Western Sahara and the Tindouf refugee camps in 2006 documented no complaints of human rights abuse in the camps, but stressed the need for more information. However, the report, which severely criticized Moroccan conduct in Western Sahara, was slammed as biased and partisan by the Moroccan government.<ref name=\"arso_2006\"/> In April 2010, the Sahrawi government had called the UN to supervise human rights in the liberated territories and refugee camps, stating that \"We are ready to fully cooperate with UN human rights observers in the territory under our control. The United Nations should take this proposal seriously, and ask Morocco to do likewise\".<ref name=\"sps_2010\"/>\n\n==2011 NGO foreign workers abduction==\nOn 23 October 2011, three European humanitarian aid workers were kidnapped in the Rabuni, the administrative center of the refugee camps.

Following Rosberg's retirement, [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]]'s [[Sebastian Vettel]] became Hamilton's closest rival in two intense championship battles, and Hamilton twice overturned mid-season points deficits to claim consecutive titles for the second time in his career in {{F1|2017}} and {{F1|2018}}. A third World Drivers' Championship followed in {{F1|2019}} to complete a [[hat-trick]] of consecutive titles, bringing his tally to six overall, second only to seven-time World Drivers' Champion [[Michael Schumacher]].\n\nHamilton has been credited with furthering Formula One's global following by appealing to a broader audience outside the sport, in part due to his high-profile lifestyle and [[Lewis Hamilton#Other ventures|other ventures]], including his environmental activism and exploits in music and fashion. Hamilton has been targeted by [[Lewis Hamilton#Racist treatment|racist abuse throughout his career]], and has been outspoken in his criticism of racial politics in Formula One as well as calling for greater diversity in the sport.

After four more years with McLaren without finishing higher than fourth in the drivers' standings, Hamilton signed with [[Mercedes-Benz in Formula One|Mercedes]] in {{F1|2013}}, reuniting with his childhood karting teammate, [[Nico Rosberg]].\n\nChanges to [[Formula One regulations#Engine|regulations]] for {{F1|2014}} mandating the use of [[Formula One engines#2014\u2013present|turbo-hybrid engines]] contributed to the start of a highly successful period for Hamilton, during which he has won five further World Championship titles.

A third World Drivers' Championship followed in {{F1|2019}} to complete a [[hat-trick]] of consecutive titles, bringing his tally to six overall, second only to seven-time World Drivers' Champion [[Michael Schumacher]].\n\nHamilton has been credited with furthering Formula One's global following by appealing to a broader audience outside the sport, in part due to his high-profile lifestyle and [[Lewis Hamilton#Other ventures|other ventures]], including his environmental activism and exploits in music and fashion. Hamilton has been targeted by [[Lewis Hamilton#Racist treatment|racist abuse throughout his career]], and has been outspoken in his criticism of racial politics in Formula One as well as calling for greater diversity in the sport.
