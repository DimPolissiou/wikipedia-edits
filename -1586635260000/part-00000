It occurred near [[Palembang]], on [[Sumatra]], on 13\u201315 February 1942. The [[Royal Dutch Shell]] oil refineries at nearby [[Pladju]] (or Pladjoe) were the major objectives for the [[Empire of Japan]] in the Pacific War, because of an oil [[embargo]] imposed on Japan by the United States, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. With the area's abundant fuel supply and airfield, Palembang offered significant potential as a military base to both the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and the Japanese.\n\n==Prelude==\nIn January, the [[American-British-Dutch-Australian Command]] (ABDACOM) decided to concentrate Allied air forces in Sumatra at two airfields near Palembang: [[Pangkalan Benteng]], also known as \"P1\" and a secret air base at [[Prabumulih]] (Praboemoelih), or \"P2\".\n\nThe British [[Royal Air Force]] created No. 225 (Bomber) Group at Palembang. It included two [[Royal Australian Air Force]] squadrons and a large number of Australians serving with British squadrons. The group could only muster 40 [[Bristol Blenheim]] light bombers and 35 [[Lockheed Hudson]] light bombers. The Blenheims had flown from the Middle East and [[Egypt]], where they were considered too old to cope with newer [[Nazi Germany|German]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Italian]] fighters. (A handful of [[United States Far East Air Force]] [[B-17 Flying Fortress]] heavy bombers also operated out of Palembang briefly in January, but these were withdrawn to [[Java (island)|Java]] and Australia before the battle commenced.)\n\nNo. 226 (Fighter) Group  RAF also arrived at Palembang in early February: two squadrons of [[Hawker Hurricane]]s transported to Sumatra by the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Indomitable|R92|6}}. They were joined by the remnants of British, Australian and [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] Hurricane and [[Brewster Buffalo]] squadrons, which had both inflicted and suffered heavy losses in intense air battles over the [[Battle of Malaya|Malayan]] and [[Battle of Singapore|Singapore campaigns]].\n\nThe [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army]] (KNIL) South Sumatra Island Territorial Command, its command in the Palembang area, consisted of about 2,000 troops under Lieutenant Colonel L. N. W. Vogelesang: the South Sumatra Garrison Battalion and a ''Stadswacht''/''Landstorm'' (\"[[Military reserve force|home guard/reserve]]\") infantry company in Palembang, a ''Stadswacht''/''Landstorm'' infantry company in [[Jambi]] (Djambi), as well as various artillery and machine gun units. (KNIL units in other parts of Sumatra lacked mobility and played no part in the fighting.) The [[Royal Netherlands Navy]] was represented by the [[minelayer]] [[Dutch minelayer Pro Patria|''Pro Patria'']] and the patrol boats ''P-38'' and ''P-40'' on the [[Musi River (Indonesia)|Musi]] river.\n\n==Battle==\n===Airborne attack===\nWhile the Allied planes attacked the Japanese ships on 13 February, [[Kawasaki Ki-56]] transport planes of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd ''[[Chutai]]'', [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Force]] (IJAAF), dropped ''[[Teishin Shudan]]'' (Raiding Group) [[paratrooper]]s over Pangkalan Benteng airfield. At the same time [[Mitsubishi Ki-21]] bombers from the 98th ''[[Sentai]]'' dropped supplies for paratroopers. The formation was escorted by a large force of [[Nakajima Ki-43]] fighters from the 59th and 64th ''Sentai''.\n\nAs many as 180 men from the Japanese 2nd Parachute Regiment, under Colonel Seiichi Kume, dropped between Palembang and Pangkalan Benteng, and more than 90 men came down west of the refineries at Pladjoe. Although the Japanese paratroopers failed to capture the Pangkalan Benteng airfield, they did manage to gain possession of the entire Pladjoe oil refinery complex undamaged. A makeshift counter-attack by ''Landstorm'' troops and anti-aircraft gunners from Praboemoelih managed to retake the complex but took heavy losses. The planned demolition failed to do any serious damage to the refinery, but the oil stores were set ablaze. Two hours after the first drop, another 60 Japanese paratroopers were dropped near Pangkalan Benteng airfield.\n\nOn 14 February, the surviving Japanese paratroopers advanced to the [[Musi River (Indonesia)|Musi]], [[Salang River|Salang]] and [[Telang]] rivers, near Palembang.\n\n===Amphibious assault===\nThe main Japanese invasion force, an [[amphibious assault]] fleet under Vice-Admiral [[Jisaburo Ozawa]] of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN), was on its way from [[Cam Ranh Bay]] in [[French Indochina]]. It was made up of the Imperial Japanese Army's [[38th Infantry Division (Japan)|229th Infantry Regiment]] and one [[battalion]] from the 230th Infantry Regiment. A small advance party set out eight transports escorted by the [[Japanese cruiser Sendai|light cruiser ''Sendai'']] and four destroyers. The main force followed in 14 transports, escorted by the [[Japanese cruiser Chokai|heavy cruiser ''Chokai'']] and four destroyers. The covering force included the [[Japanese aircraft carrier Ryujo|aircraft carrier ''Ryujo'']], four heavy cruisers, one light cruiser and three destroyers. Additional air cover was provided by land-based IJN planes and the IJAAF [[3rd Air Division (Japan)|3rd Air Division]].\n\nOn the morning of 13 February, a river boat commandeered by the British [[Royal Navy]], [[HMS Li Wo|HMS ''Li Wo'']]&nbsp;\u2014 under Lieutenant [[Thomas Wilkinson (Royal Naval Reserve)|Thomas Wilkinson]]&nbsp;\u2014 ferrying personnel and equipment between Singapore and the Dutch East Indies, ran into the Japanese fleet. Although ''Li Wo'' was armed only with a 4-inch (100&nbsp;mm) gun and two machineguns, its crew fired at the Japanese troop transport ships, setting one on fire and damaging several others, while under fire from the Japanese cruisers. This action continued for 90 minutes until the ''Li Wo'' ran out of ammunition. Wilkinson then ordered the [[ramming]] of the nearest transport, before his ship was destroyed by Japanese fire. Wilkinson received a [[Posthumous recognition|posthumous]] [[Victoria Cross]] (VC), the highest award for gallantry in the British Commonwealth, and the only VC awarded in the [[Dutch East Indies campaign]].\n\nOn 15 February, an ABDA naval force of five cruisers, [[HNLMS De Ruyter (1935)|HNLMS ''De Ruyter'']], {{HNLMS|Java|1921|6}} and [[HNLMS Tromp (1937)|HNLMS ''Tromp'']], {{HMS|Exeter|68|6}}, [[HMAS Hobart (1939)|HMAS ''Hobart'']] and 10 destroyers, under Admiral [[Karel Doorman]], made an abortive attempt to intercept the Japanese force. Planes from ''Ryujo'' and land-based aircraft made a series of attacks on the Allied ships, forcing them to withdraw to the south of Sumatra.\n\nAs the Japanese landing force approached Sumatra, the remaining Allied aircraft attacked it, and the Japanese transport ship ''Otawa Maru'' was sunk. Hurricanes flew up the rivers, machine-gunning Japanese landing craft.\n\nHowever, on the afternoon of 15 February, all Allied aircraft were ordered to Java, where a major Japanese attack was anticipated, and the Allied air units had withdrawn from southern Sumatra by the evening of 16 February 1942. Other personnel were evacuated via Oosthaven (now [[Bandar Lampung]]) by ships to Java or India.\n\n[[File:Oosthaven - Port facilities destroyed 01.jpg|thumb|250px|Port facilities at Oosthaven was destroyed by scorched-earth policy]]\n\n==References==\n*{{cite web\n | last = Klemen\n | first = L\n | title = The battle for Palembang, February 1942\n | url=http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/palembang.html\n | work = The Netherlands East Indies 1941\u201342\n}}\n*{{cite web\n |last         = Klemen\n |first        = L\n |title        = The Japanese Invasion of Sumatra Island\n |url          = http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/fall_sumatra.html\n |work         = The Netherlands East Indies 1941\u201342\n |access-date  = 9 August 2010\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20121203032143/http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/fall_sumatra.html\n |archive-date = 3 December 2012\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}\n\n{{coord missing|Indonesia}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Palembang, Battle of}}\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1942]]\n[[Category:1942 in Indonesia]]\n[[Category:South West Pacific theatre of World War II]]\n[[Category:Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies]]\n[[Category:Battles and operations of World War II involving the Netherlands]]\n[[Category:Battles of World War II involving Japan]]\n[[Category:Naval battles of World War II involving the United Kingdom|B]]\n[[Category:Battles of World War II involving Australia]]\n[[Category:Battles of World War II involving New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Airborne operations of World War II]]\n[[Category:Palembang]]\n[[Category:1942 in the Dutch East Indies]]\n[[Category:February 1942 events]]\n", "text_old": "{{For2|the air attacks on Palembang in 1945|[[Operation Outflank]]|the 15th-century naval battle|[[Battle of Palembang (1407)]]}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2017}}\n{{Infobox military conflict\n| conflict    = Battle of Palembang\n| image       = Palembang location.png\n| image_size  = 280px\n| caption     = Palembang location.

''The Catholic Almanac'', 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-59276-441-9}} page 155</ref> Originally, the scapular was a broad band of cloth over the shoulders, serving as an apron, still worn as part of the religious habit by a number of orders of monks and friars. The Brown Scapular has been a key element of Carmelite history since the late 13th century.<ref>[http://www.ewtn.com/library/SCRIPTUR/SCAPULAR.TXT Most, William. \"The Brown Scapular\", EWTN]</ref>\n\nLike the purported vision of Mary to St. Dominic, the earliest mention of Simon Stock's vision comes over 100 years later, and there is a lack of documentary evidence that would demonstrate the truth or historicity of the apparition. While Richard Copsey questioned the fact that any apparition took place with respect to the scapular,<ref>Copsey, Richard. ''Simon Stock and the Scapular Vision'', The Journal of Ecclesiastical History, 50:4:652\u2013683, 1999</ref> Benedict Zimmerman proposed that an apparition did take place in the 13th century, but was to another Carmelite brother, which was later attributed to St. Simon Stock, and that the vision was not of the Virgin Mary, but of a recently deceased Carmelite.<ref>Zimmerman, O.C.D., Benedict. ''The Carmelite Scapular'', \"The Month\", Vol. 150, 1927, pp. 323\u2013237</ref> Over time, the scapular took an increasingly Marian tone, became identified with Carmelite piety toward the Virgin Mary, and the feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel began to be called the \"scapular feast\". <ref>[http://www.zenit.org/article-23225?l=english Kavanaugh, Kieran. \"Brown Scapular: a 'Silent Devotion'\", ''Zenit'', July 16, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504164642/http://www.zenit.org/article-23225?l=english |date=May 4, 2009 }}</ref> Although the historicity of the scapular vision is rejected, the scapular itself has remained for all Carmelites a sign of Mary's motherly protection and as a personal commitment to follow Jesus in the footsteps of his Mother, the perfect model for all his disciples.\n\nCarmelite tradition has held that, in 1251, the [[Virgin Mary]] made the \"Scapular Promise\" to St. Simon Stock regarding the [[Scapular of Our Lady of Mount Carmel]], namely: \"whoever dies clothed in this habit shall not suffer the fires of Hell.\"<ref name=\"Thomas Petrisko 2000, page 105\">Petrisko, Thomas.''Inside Heaven and Hell'', St. Andrews Press, 2000, {{ISBN|978-1-891903-23-6}} page 105</ref> This is understood to mean that anyone who remains faithful to the Carmelite vocation until death will be granted the grace of final perseverance.<ref name=catechesis>[http://carmelitanacollection.com/catechesis.html Morello, OCD, Sam Anthony and McMahon, O.Carm., Patrick. \"A Catechesis on the Brown Scapular\", ''The Scapular of Our Lady of Mount Carmel: Catechesis and Ritual'', 2000] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109024243/http://carmelitanacollection.com/catechesis.html |date=2016-01-09 }}</ref> The long-standing tradition of the Church has approved the vision of St. Simon Stock as an acceptable cult, but that is distinguishable from authenticating it as a historical experience. \"The question then, from a historical perspective, is not whether Mary appeared to Simon Stock and gave him the scapular, but rather did Simon Stock perceive the Mother of God bestowing this sign of her protection on him and his brothers in Carmel.\"<ref name=catechesis/> The likelihood is \"probably not\". However, wearing the scapular remains a valuable devotion as a sign of one's commitment to Mary, and a pledge of her protection.\n\nAccording to Christian P. Ceroke: \"The wearing of the Scapular fosters a true devotion to Mary that is based on her supernatural mission in the redemption of mankind. Two Marian beliefs are proposed in the devotion of the Brown Scapular: Mary's Spiritual Maternity and her Mediation of Grace.\"<ref>''The Scapular Devotion'', [[EWTN]], [http://www.ewtn.com/library/mary/scapular.htm]</ref>\n\n==Historical developments==\n{{Scapulars}}\n{{Main|History of the Rosary}}\n===Confraternities===\nThe beginning of the 18th century witnessed a significant growth in Marian confraternities, such as the [[Confraternities of the Rosary]]. A small number of such confraternities had started sometime in the 15th century, through the preaching of Alan de Rupe. Their numbers began to grow under the supervision of the [[Dominican order|Dominican]]s, which also helped create a more uniform format for the Rosary. An important Apostolic Constitution on the Rosary Confraternity was issued by [[Pope Leo XIII]] in 1898.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13188b.htm Thurston, Herbert. \"Confraternity of the Holy Rosary.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 13. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 22 Dec. 2014]</ref>\n\nThe approval of the \"Confraternity of the Scapular\" for every diocese helped the spread of that devotion, reaching its culmination in 1726 via the extension of the [[Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel]] (July 16) to the universal Church.<ref>Lea, Henry Charles.

The spread of the devotion to both the rosary and the scapular was influenced by [[Marian apparition]]s of [[Our Lady of F\u00e1tima]] reported by three Portuguese children in 1917.<ref>[http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/tsfatima.htm de Marchi, John. ''The True Story of Fatima'', Catechetical Guild Educational Society, St. Paul, Minnesota, 1952]</ref> The Fatima messages placed a strong emphasis on the rosary, and in them the Virgin Mary reportedly identified herself as ''The Lady of the Rosary''.<ref>Bunson, Matthew. ''Encyclopedia of Catholic History'', OSV Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-1-59276-026-8}} p. 348</ref> The visions and messages also encouraged the wearing of the Brown Scapular. In the final F\u00e1tima appearance on 13 October 1917, the Virgin Mary had a brown [[scapular]] in one hand and a [[rosary]] in the other.<ref>Santos, Lucia. ''Fatima in Lucia's Own Words'', Ravengate Press, 1976, {{ISBN|0-911218-10-6}}</ref>\n\n===Associations===\nThe 20th century witnessed the development of a number of Marian organizations. The [[Blue Army of Our Lady of Fatima]] was formed in 1946 in the United States and through \"Scapular Magazine\" helped enroll one million Americans to pray the Rosary based on the F\u00e1tima messages regarding the [[consecration of Russia]]. The Blue Army eventually reached a larger audience of several million members.<ref>Stravinskas, Peter.

While Richard Copsey questioned the fact that any apparition took place with respect to the scapular,<ref>Copsey, Richard. ''Simon Stock and the Scapular Vision'', The Journal of Ecclesiastical History, 50:4:652\u2013683, 1999</ref> Benedict Zimmerman proposed that an apparition did take place in the 13th century, but was to another Carmelite brother, which was later attributed to St. Simon Stock, and that the vision was not of the Virgin Mary, but of a recently deceased Carmelite.<ref>Zimmerman, O.C.D., Benedict. ''The Carmelite Scapular'', \"The Month\", Vol. 150, 1927, pp. 323\u2013237</ref> Over time, the scapular took an increasingly Marian tone, became identified with Carmelite piety toward the Virgin Mary, and the feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel began to be called the \"scapular feast\". <ref>[http://www.zenit.org/article-23225?l=english Kavanaugh, Kieran. \"Brown Scapular: a 'Silent Devotion'\", ''Zenit'', July 16, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504164642/http://www.zenit.org/article-23225?l=english |date=May 4, 2009 }}</ref> Although the historicity of the scapular vision is rejected, the scapular itself has remained for all Carmelites a sign of Mary's motherly protection and as a personal commitment to follow Jesus in the footsteps of his Mother, the perfect model for all his disciples.\n\nCarmelite tradition has held that, in 1251, the [[Virgin Mary]] made the \"Scapular Promise\" to St. Simon Stock regarding the [[Scapular of Our Lady of Mount Carmel]], namely: \"whoever dies clothed in this habit shall not suffer the fires of Hell.\"<ref name=\"Thomas Petrisko 2000, page 105\">Petrisko, Thomas.''Inside Heaven and Hell'', St. Andrews Press, 2000, {{ISBN|978-1-891903-23-6}} page 105</ref> This is understood to mean that anyone who remains faithful to the Carmelite vocation until death will be granted the grace of final perseverance.<ref name=catechesis>[http://carmelitanacollection.com/catechesis.html Morello, OCD, Sam Anthony and McMahon, O.Carm., Patrick. \"A Catechesis on the Brown Scapular\", ''The Scapular of Our Lady of Mount Carmel: Catechesis and Ritual'', 2000] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109024243/http://carmelitanacollection.com/catechesis.html |date=2016-01-09 }}</ref> The long-standing tradition of the Church has approved the vision of St. Simon Stock as an acceptable cult, but that is distinguishable from authenticating it as a historical experience. \"The question then, from a historical perspective, is not whether Mary appeared to Simon Stock and gave him the scapular, but rather did Simon Stock perceive the Mother of God bestowing this sign of her protection on him and his brothers in Carmel.\"<ref name=catechesis/> The likelihood is \"probably not\". However, wearing the scapular remains a valuable devotion as a sign of one's commitment to Mary, and a pledge of her protection.\n\nAccording to Christian P. Ceroke: \"The wearing of the Scapular fosters a true devotion to Mary that is based on her supernatural mission in the redemption of mankind.

A small number of such confraternities had started sometime in the 15th century, through the preaching of Alan de Rupe. Their numbers began to grow under the supervision of the [[Dominican order|Dominican]]s, which also helped create a more uniform format for the Rosary. An important Apostolic Constitution on the Rosary Confraternity was issued by [[Pope Leo XIII]] in 1898.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13188b.htm Thurston, Herbert. \"Confraternity of the Holy Rosary.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia.

The spread of the devotion to both the rosary and the scapular was influenced by [[Marian apparition]]s of [[Our Lady of F\u00e1tima]] reported by three Portuguese children in 1917.<ref>[http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/tsfatima.htm de Marchi, John.

He is also notable for being the [[bassist]]/[[composer]] of the experimental rock trio [[Dreadnaught USA|Dreadnaught]], Music Director for the [[NHPR]]/Music Hall series ''Writers on a New England Stage'', and in-studio producer of [[Grammy]]-winning clarinetist [[Richard Stoltzman]].\n\nHe has more than 150 credits as a producer, executive producer, performer, arranger, label manager, and composer, and with [[Pete Townshend]] of [[The Who]] served as co-producer for the double-album release by [[Lawrence Ball]], ''Method Music.''<ref>http://pavement.stevevorass.com/artists/lawrence-balls-method-music-brings-pete-townshends-lifehouse-to-reality/</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== Composer & bassist ===\nLord's musical output spans the rock, classical, jazz, pop, film, and experimental genres, and he has composed, produced, and arranged for a wide cross-section of instrumentation, including orchestra (\"James Thresher Industries\"), rock band (\"The Elevator Chaser\"), piano (\"Kazak, The Hound Of Space\"), string orchestra (\"Creepin'\"), and electronics (\"Agah Eegah\"). His music is largely [[instrumental]] and generally eschews [[song format]], with some exceptions (\"Bony Cleave\", \"Danny\").\n\nAs a recording artist, Lord has appeared on over 3 dozen releases and won numerous awards for his work. Dreadnaught's ''The American Standard'' (2001) was one of the best-reviewed [[progressive rock]] releases of its year,<ref>http://www.progressiveworld.net/html/modules.php?name=Reviews&rop=showcontent&id=3163</ref> and the decade-long retrospective ''High Heat & Chin Music'' (2007) received a \"Best Of NH 2007\" award from ''[[New Hampshire Magazine]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhmagazine.com/nhbest/408040-102/best-of-new-hampshire-2007.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126101328/http://www.nhmagazine.com/nhbest/408040-102/best-of-new-hampshire-2007.html |archivedate=2012-01-26 |df= }}</ref> As a bassist he has been noted for his crisp tone (achieved through frequent use of a [[plectrum]]) and unusual bass lines.<ref>http://www.progressor.net/review/dreadnaught_2005.html</ref>\n\n=== Producer ===\nIn 2002, while beginning preparations for what would become Dreadnaught's double-disc ''Live At Mojo'' (Comet Records), Lord began composing and producing music for film and other media; his work includes music for \"Flying Downhill\", a documentary on [[Winter Olympic Games|Olympic]] skier [[Bode Miller]], \"Marilyn's Man\", a [[Marilyn Monroe]] documentary released by [[Universal Studios|Universal]], \"Wander\", an award-winning short film which aired on [[Independent Film Channel|IFC]],<ref>http://www.ifc.com/videos/wander.php</ref> and the theme song for \"The Exchange\" from [[New Hampshire Public Radio]].\n\nLord began producing for MMC Recordings in 2005 where he worked with [[Richard Stoltzman]], [[Pixar]]/[[Randy Newman]] orchestrator Jonathan Sacks, and company owner and composer/pianist [[William Thomas McKinley]] among others, with credits on more than 30 releases over the next three years and recording with numerous orchestras, composers, ensembles, and players.\n\nIn 2008, Lord launched PARMA Recordings, an audio production company, and Navona Records, a classical imprint. In 2009, PARMA acquired the classical label [[Capstone Records]] and Big Round Records (previously owned by Congressman [[Paul Hodes]]), and launched Ravello Records, an imprint dedicated to modern classical music. In 2011, PARMA acquired MMC Recordings and the boutique online publisher ThatNewMusicWebsite/ThatNewMusicLibrary.\n\nPARMA's releases include work by Pulitzer Prize winners [[Lewis Spratlan]] and [[Donald Martino]], [[New York Philharmonic]] concertmaster [[Glenn Dicterow]], former Congressman and [[Orleans (band)|Orleans]] founder [[John Hall (New York politician)|John Hall]], percussionist [[Steve Gadd]], the [[London Symphony Orchestra]], children's artist [[Raffi (musician)|Raffi]], and jazz bassist [[Eddie G\u00f3mez (musician)|Eddie G\u00f3mez]], violin and guitar ensemble Duo46 (music of John Carollo) among others.\n\nIn 2011, Lord served as co-producer with [[Pete Townshend]] of [[The Who]] for Lawrence Ball's ''Method Music'', released in January 2012 on Navona Records. The album is a continuation of the concepts first explored in Townshend's [[Lifehouse (rock opera)|Lifehouse]] project and [[Lifehouse Method]] website.\n\n=== Performances ===\nSince its formation in 1996, Lord's primary performance vehicle has been Dreadnaught. The band began touring nationally in 2000 as a trio, performed in more than half of the U.S. states, and earned a reputation as a highly accomplished musical unit equally proficient in highly structured compositions and free-wheeling improvisation.\n\nWith Dreadnaught, Lord has shared a stage with [[John Entwistle]] ([[The Who]]), [[Tony Levin]] ([[Peter Gabriel]], [[King Crimson]]), [[NRBQ]], [[Jim Weider]] ([[The Band]]), [[California Guitar Trio]], and the [[Young Dubliners]]. In 2005, the group began a prominent stint as house band for the [[New Hampshire Public Radio]] series ''Writers on a New England Stage'' at the Music Hall in [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]], where it has performed with [[Stephen King]], [[Dan Brown]], [[Ken Burns]], [[Alan Alda]], [[John Updike]], [[Elmore Leonard]], [[Madeleine Albright]], and [[Mitch Albom]], among others.  The series has attracted international coverage and has been featured in press outlets such as ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'' and ''[[Good Morning America]]''.\n\nIn 2011, Lord served as on-air host for the [[NHPR]]/Music Hall live radio series ''Live@TheLoft'', which featured the artists [[Buffalo Tom]], [[Stew (musician)]] & The Negro Problem, [[Frazey Ford]], and [[Patty Larkin]].\n\n== Credits ==\n\n===''Executive Producer/Producer (Partial List)''===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!'''Album Title''' !!

He is also notable for being the [[bassist]]/[[composer]] of the experimental rock trio [[Dreadnaught USA|Dreadnaught]], Music Director for the [[NHPR]]/Music Hall series ''Writers on a New England Stage'', and in-studio producer of [[Grammy]]-winning clarinetist [[Richard Stoltzman]].\n\nHe has more than 150 credits as a producer, executive producer, performer, arranger, label manager, and composer, and with [[Pete Townshend]] of [[The Who]] served as co-producer for the double-album release by [[Lawrence Ball]], ''Method Music.''<ref>http://pavement.stevevorass.com/artists/lawrence-balls-method-music-brings-pete-townshends-lifehouse-to-reality/</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== Composer & bassist ===\nLord's musical output spans the rock, classical, jazz, pop, film, and experimental genres, and he has composed, produced, and arranged for a wide cross-section of instrumentation, including orchestra (\"James Thresher Industries\"), rock band (\"The Elevator Chaser\"), piano (\"Kazak, The Hound Of Space\"), string orchestra (\"Creepin'\"), and electronics (\"Agah Eegah\"). His music is largely [[instrumental]] and generally eschews [[song format]], with some exceptions (\"Bony Cleave\", \"Danny\").\n\nAs a recording artist, Lord has appeared on over 3 dozen releases and won numerous awards for his work. Dreadnaught's ''The American Standard'' (2001) was one of the best-reviewed [[progressive rock]] releases of its year,<ref>http://www.progressiveworld.net/html/modules.php?name=Reviews&rop=showcontent&id=3163</ref> and the decade-long retrospective ''High Heat & Chin Music'' (2007) received a \"Best Of NH 2007\" award from ''[[New Hampshire Magazine]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhmagazine.com/nhbest/408040-102/best-of-new-hampshire-2007.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126101328/http://www.nhmagazine.com/nhbest/408040-102/best-of-new-hampshire-2007.html |archivedate=2012-01-26 |df= }}</ref> As a bassist he has been noted for his crisp tone (achieved through frequent use of a [[plectrum]]) and unusual bass lines.<ref>http://www.progressor.net/review/dreadnaught_2005.html</ref>\n\n=== Producer ===\nIn 2002, while beginning preparations for what would become Dreadnaught's double-disc ''Live At Mojo'' (Comet Records), Lord began composing and producing music for film and other media; his work includes music for \"Flying Downhill\", a documentary on [[Winter Olympic Games|Olympic]] skier [[Bode Miller]], \"Marilyn's Man\", a [[Marilyn Monroe]] documentary released by [[Universal Studios|Universal]], \"Wander\", an award-winning short film which aired on [[Independent Film Channel|IFC]],<ref>http://www.ifc.com/videos/wander.php</ref> and the theme song for \"The Exchange\" from [[New Hampshire Public Radio]].\n\nLord began producing for MMC Recordings in 2005 where he worked with [[Richard Stoltzman]], [[Pixar]]/[[Randy Newman]] orchestrator Jonathan Sacks, and company owner and composer/pianist [[William Thomas McKinley]] among others, with credits on more than 30 releases over the next three years and recording with numerous orchestras, composers, ensembles, and players.\n\nIn 2008, Lord launched PARMA Recordings, an audio production company, and Navona Records, a classical imprint. In 2009, PARMA acquired the classical label [[Capstone Records]] and Big Round Records (previously owned by Congressman [[Paul Hodes]]), and launched Ravello Records, an imprint dedicated to modern classical music. In 2011, PARMA acquired MMC Recordings and the boutique online publisher ThatNewMusicWebsite/ThatNewMusicLibrary.\n\nPARMA's releases include work by Pulitzer Prize winners [[Lewis Spratlan]] and [[Donald Martino]], [[New York Philharmonic]] concertmaster [[Glenn Dicterow]], former Congressman and [[Orleans (band)|Orleans]] founder [[John Hall (New York politician)|John Hall]], percussionist [[Steve Gadd]], the [[London Symphony Orchestra]], children's artist [[Raffi (musician)|Raffi]], and jazz bassist [[Eddie G\u00f3mez (musician)|Eddie G\u00f3mez]], among others.\n\nIn 2011, Lord served as co-producer with [[Pete Townshend]] of [[The Who]] for Lawrence Ball's ''Method Music'', released in January 2012 on Navona Records. The album is a continuation of the concepts first explored in Townshend's [[Lifehouse (rock opera)|Lifehouse]] project and [[Lifehouse Method]] website.\n\n=== Performances ===\nSince its formation in 1996, Lord's primary performance vehicle has been Dreadnaught. The band began touring nationally in 2000 as a trio, performed in more than half of the U.S. states, and earned a reputation as a highly accomplished musical unit equally proficient in highly structured compositions and free-wheeling improvisation.\n\nWith Dreadnaught, Lord has shared a stage with [[John Entwistle]] ([[The Who]]), [[Tony Levin]] ([[Peter Gabriel]], [[King Crimson]]), [[NRBQ]], [[Jim Weider]] ([[The Band]]), [[California Guitar Trio]], and the [[Young Dubliners]]. In 2005, the group began a prominent stint as house band for the [[New Hampshire Public Radio]] series ''Writers on a New England Stage'' at the Music Hall in [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]], where it has performed with [[Stephen King]], [[Dan Brown]], [[Ken Burns]], [[Alan Alda]], [[John Updike]], [[Elmore Leonard]], [[Madeleine Albright]], and [[Mitch Albom]], among others.  The series has attracted international coverage and has been featured in press outlets such as ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'' and ''[[Good Morning America]]''.\n\nIn 2011, Lord served as on-air host for the [[NHPR]]/Music Hall live radio series ''Live@TheLoft'', which featured the artists [[Buffalo Tom]], [[Stew (musician)]] & The Negro Problem, [[Frazey Ford]], and [[Patty Larkin]].\n\n== Credits ==\n\n===''Executive Producer/Producer (Partial List)''===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!'''Album Title''' !!
