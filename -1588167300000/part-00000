It is the oldest municipal cemetery in the state and has approximately 7,700 marked, and 2,600 unmarked, graves.<ref>The cemetery has also been known as Elford Cemetery, the Old Graveyard, and the Old Village Burial Ground.

Many other burials occurred in the area after Thompson sold 60 acres of his property to one Francis H. McLeod in 1817.  In 1829 McLeod opened the private graveyard to the public, and in 1833, he conveyed a tract of land to the city for use as a cemetery. The city acquired additional acres during the 1870s, and the last five acres of the cemetery were purchased before 1944.<ref>Ward, 29-30. There is no evidence that Francis McLeod was buried in the cemetery. It is also unclear why at a time when most families had cemetery plots of their own and the nearly adjoining [[churchyard]] of Christ Episcopal Church was \"remarkably ecumenical\" in its burial practices that \"a village of 750 people needed two cemeteries within a tenth of a mile of each other.\" Judith Bainbridge, \"Churchyard abounds in curious mysteries,\" ''Greenville News'', City People, September 24, 2014, 2-3.</ref> Presumably the cemetery was named for a spring that was once included in, or was just beyond, its boundaries.<ref>NRHP Registration Form, 6.

Eighty unknown Confederate soldiers are buried near the entrance, presumably soldiers who died of wounds or disease after being removed to one of the two Greenville buildings used for hospitals during the Civil War.<ref>Ward, 35; Archie Vernon Huff, ''Greenville: The History of the City and County in the South Carolina Piedmont'' (Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, 1995), 139.

The [[Shekhawati]] gets its name from him, comprising the districts of [[Sikar district|Sikar]], [[Churu district|Churu]] and [[Jhunjhunu district|Jhunjhunu]] in the present-day Indian state of [[Rajasthan]]. The descendants of him known as the \"Shekhawat\".\n\n==Birth==\nHe was born to the [[Kachhwaha]] chief Mokal singh at [[Amarsar]]. His parents, previously childless, are said to have sought the prayers of intercession(the action of saying a prayer on behalf of another) of the Muslim [[Pir (Sufism)|pir]] Shaikh Burhan, for whom Shekha was named. In due time shaikh burhan had an heir,who according to the injunctions of boorhan, was styled after his own tribe,Shekh. He directed that child should wear the buddea(a strings or threads) which, when laid aside , was to be suspended at the saint's [[Dargah|durgah]]; and further ,that he should assume the blue [[tunic]] and cap, abstain from [[Pig|hog's]] flesh and eat no meat\"in which the blood remained.\" He also ordained that at the birth of every Shekhawat male infant a goat should be sacrificed. These obligations religiously maintained by a couple of centuries. <ref name=\":03\">{{Cite book|last=James tod|first=|url=http://ndl.iitkgp.ac.in/document/eXlWV2YwcUJjMmk5NStkV1dBOWlUVmtoM2tNa2hCUFBxMlo0MGd1QzRiND0|title=Clear writing edition of -Annals & Antiquities of Rajasthan or the central & western Rajput states of India|date=1873|publisher= madras Higginbotham and co 165 mount road|year=1873|isbn=|location=|page=359}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Hooja|first=Rima|title=A History of Rajasthan|publisher=Rupa & Company|year=2006|isbn=9788129115010|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Coronation==\nMahaRao Shekha has succeeded as the head \u00a0of ''Nan and Barwada'' estate along with 24 more villages \u00a0at the tender age of 12 years \u00a0as a result of untimely death of his father Mokal Ji in V.S 1502; A.D 1445.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Singh Shekhawat|first=Thakur Surjan|title=Rao Shekha|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Life==\nMaharao Shekha, when he attained man's estate, greatly augmented the territory left by his father, and consolidated 360 villages under his sway,by conquest from his neighbours, when his reputation and power attracted the jealous notice of the lord paramount of amber. He was attached, but by the aid of the [[Pathans of Rajasthan|Punnee Pathans]] he successfully withstood the reiterated assaults of his suzerain. Up to this period they had acknowledged the amber prices as liege lords, and in token of alliance paid as tribute all the colts reared on the original estate. A dispute on this point was the ostensible cause(though subordinate to their rapid prosperity), which occasioned a total separation of the Shekhawat colonies from the parent state, until the reign of Sawai Jay Singh, submission and pecuniary relief from them.

The [[Shekhawati]] gets its name from him, comprising the districts of [[Sikar district|Sikar]], [[Churu district|Churu]] and [[Jhunjhunu district|Jhunjhunu]] in the present-day Indian state of [[Rajasthan]]. The descendants of him known as the \"Shekhawat\".\n\n==Birth==\nHe was born to the [[Kachhwaha]] chief Mokal singh at [[Amarsar]]. His parents, previously childless, are said to have sought the prayers of intercession(the action of saying a prayer on behalf of another) of the Muslim [[Pir (Sufism)|pir]] Shaikh Burhan, for whom Shekha was named. In due time shaikh burhan had an heir,who according to the injunctions of boorhan, was styled after his own tribe,Shekh. He directed that child should wear the buddea(a strings or threads) which, when laid aside , was to be suspended at the saint's [[Dargah|durgah]]; and further ,that he should assume the blue [[tunic]] and cap, abstain from [[Pig|hog's]] flesh and eat no meat\"in which the blood remained.\" He also ordained that at the birth of every Shekhawat male infant a goat should be sacrificed. These obligations religiously maintained by a couple of centuries. <ref name=\":03\">{{Cite book|last=James tod|first=|url=http://ndl.iitkgp.ac.in/document/eXlWV2YwcUJjMmk5NStkV1dBOWlUVmtoM2tNa2hCUFBxMlo0MGd1QzRiND0|title=Clear writing edition of -Annals & Antiquities of Rajasthan or the central & western Rajput states of India|date=1873|publisher= madras Higginbotham and co 165 mount road|year=1873|isbn=|location=|page=359}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Hooja|first=Rima|title=A History of Rajasthan|publisher=Rupa & Company|year=2006|isbn=9788129115010|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Coronation==\nMahaRao Shekha has succeeded as the head \u00a0of ''Nan and Barwada'' estate along with 24 more villages \u00a0at the tender age of 12 years \u00a0as a result of untimely death of his father Mokal Ji in V.S 1502; A.D 1445.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Singh Shekhawat|first=Thakur Surjan|title=Rao Shekha|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Life==\nMaharao Shekha, when he attained man's estate, greatly augmented the territory left by his father, and consolidated 360 villages under his sway,by conquest from his neighbours, when his reputation and power attracted the jealous notice of the lord paramount of amber. He was attached, but by the aid of the [[Pathans of Rajasthan|Punnee Pathans]] he successfully withstood the reiterated assaults of his suzerain. Up to this period they had acknowledged the amber prices as liege lords, and in token of alliance paid as tribute all the colts reared on the original estate. A dispute on this point was the ostensible cause(though subordinate to their rapid prosperity), which occasioned a total separation of the Shekhawat colonies from the parent state, until the reign of Sawai Jay Singh, submission and pecuniary relief from them. Shekha left a well-established authority to his youngest son Raimal.<ref name=\":04\">{{Cite book|last=James tod|first=|url=http://ndl.iitkgp.ac.in/document/eXlWV2YwcUJjMmk5NStkV1dBOWlUVmtoM2tNa2hCUFBxMlo0MGd1QzRiND0|title=Clear writing edition of - Annals & Antiquities of Rajasthan or the central & western Rajput states of India|date=1873|publisher= madras Higginbotham and co 165 mount road|year=1873|isbn=|location=|page=360]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Hooja|first=Rima|title=A History of Rajasthan|publisher=Rupa & Company|year=2006|isbn=9788129115010|location=|pages=}}</ref></br>\n\n==Death==\nShekha died in the year V.S 1545;A.D 1488 fighting the Gaur Rajputs in the war of ''Ghatwa'' defending the modesty and self respect of a newly wed lady.

It is also the site for various celebrations and festivals in the city. In the third phase of the project, the length of the boulevard will be extended to reach the seaport in Barangay Galas.\n\n==Geography==\nDipolog City is known to be as the \"'''Gateway to Western Mindanao'''\" it is situated in the Northwestern part of the Province of [[Zamboanga del Norte]]. It is bounded on the north by [[Dapitan City]], on the east by the Municipality of [[Polanco, Zamboanga del Norte|Polanco]], on the south by the Municipality of [[Sergio Osme\u00f1a Sr., Zamboanga del Norte|Sergio Osme\u00f1a Sr.]] and on the west by the Municipality of [[Katipunan, Zamboanga del Norte|Katipunan]].\n\nIts land area in 1914 covered an approximate land area of 248,587 hectares under Act No. 302 of the Philippine Islands. It was substantially reduced in 1951 to the current 13,628 hectares, after two [[barrio]]s of Dipolog were converted into Municipalities of [[Polanco, Zamboanga del Norte|Polanco]], and [[Pi\u00f1an, Zamboanga del Norte|Pi\u00f1an]] under Executive Order of the President No. 467, dated August 22, 1951.\n\n===Barangays===\nDipolog City is politically subdivided into 21 [[barangay]]s.\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* Barra (Urban)\n* Biasong (Urban)\n* Central (Urban)\n* Cogon  (nature park)\n* Dicayas (Urban)\n* Diwan   (nature park)\n* Estaka (Urban)\n* Galas (Urban)\n* Gulayon (Urban)\n* Lugdungan  (suburban)\n* Minaog     (urban)\n* Miputak (Urban)\n* Olingan (Urban)\n* Punta      (suburban)\n* San Jose  (Agriculture)\n* Sangkol   (Agriculture)\n* Santa Filomena ( Urban)\n* Santa Isabel (Urban)\n* Sicayab (Urban)\n* Sinaman (Agriculture)\n* Turno (Urban)\n}}\n\n===Climate===\nDipolog has a [[tropical rainforest climate]], according to the K\u00f6ppen Climate classification with ample rain distributed quite evenly throughout the year and warm to hot temperatures.

At that time, ''Tulwanan's'' political territory was still part of the Municipality of Dapitan with Don Domingo Ruiz, a native, as its ''capit\u00e1n'' or town executive.\nSometime that year, a Spanish Recollect missionary arrived in Tulwanan looking for its [[barrio]] executive or local chieftain. Upon meeting a native, the missionary asked; \"\u00bfD\u00f3nde est\u00e1 el capit\u00e1n?\". The native understanding only the word \"capit\u00e1n\" pointed to the west and said in Subanen ''Di-pag'', meaning across the river. Guided by his servant, a Tagalog boy named Antonio Subido, the missionary proceeded down river and upon reaching the Boholano settlement, named the place \"Dipag\".\n\nTechnically, Dipag and Tulwanan were two different settlements at that time with the former composed of Boholano natives and the latter mostly of Subanen ancestry. When the friar returned to Dapitan, he identified the location of the larger Boholano settlement as Dipag but was not officially written. Frequent conversations by the Spaniards pronounced it in Spanish accent ''Dipolog'' which was eventually adopted by the natives. The final political survey surprisingly added the letter 'L' written on it after officially becoming a barrio of Dapitan. From that time Tulwanan's political identity ceased to exist.\nBy the 12th century the Subanen settlers had colonized most of what is now [[Zamboanga Peninsula]] region. It was customary for tribes to establish their settlements at the mouth of large river systems due to the abundant food supply. However, due to frequent raids from seafaring Chinese [[pirates]], they decided to move their settlements inland.\n\nIn the 14th century, '''Tulwanan''' was established 6 kilometers inland, adjoining the river near the present day ''barangay'' center of ''Lugdungan''.\n\nIn the 15th century, settlers from neighboring [[Negros Island|Negros]] and [[Bohol]] islands established coastline settlements in Mindanao but suffered the same raids by Chinese pirates, prompting them to also move their settlements away from the coastline. They established another settlement in what is now called Sianib, a ''barangay'' of present-day [[Polanco, Zamboanga del Norte|Polanco]] town, some twenty kilometers from the coast at Barrio Gulayon(Barangay Gulayon).\n\nIt was only in 1563 that the first recorded Visayan settlement of some 800 families from Bohol, led by the chieftain Datu Pagbuaya, landed in [[Mindanao]] and established a coastal settlement in what is now called [[Dapitan]]. This settlement was strong enough to repel the Chinese pirates of the Sulu Sea. As a result, Dapitan Bay was scene of many bloody conflicts between Pagbuaya's men and Chinese pirates.\n\n===Mindanao's first Christian settlement===\nIn 1565, Don [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi]] who was accompanied by famed navigator Fr. [[Andr\u00e9s de Urdaneta]], an Augustinian friar, visited the Boholano chieftain Datu Pagbuaya on the invitation of [[Datu Sikatuna]]. There they found the place of Datu Pagbuaya to be a thriving settlement. In his chronicle, Fr. Urdaneta named the place Daquepitan. [[Peter Kaerius]] (Pieter van den Keere) identified the location as ''Dapito'' in his cartographic map of 1598. It was later identified as \"Dapite\" in [[Robert Dudley (explorer)|Robert Dudley]]'s map of 1646. Other names ascribed to the location include \"Dapyto\" in Sanson's map of 1652 and \"Dapitan\" which can be found in [[Herman Moll|Moll]]'s map of the East Indies, 1729 and in Murillo Velarde's map of 1734. After [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi|Legazpi]]'s visit, the [[Christianization]] of Mindanao was officially initiated by the Augustinian friars who arrived with him.\n\nIn 1581, members of The [[Society of Jesus]] came to the Philippines for the purpose of evangelization. When the country was divided among four [[Religious order#Christian tradition|religious orders]] in 1598, the Jesuits were given the Diocese of Cebu which covered the Visayas and Mindanao. Thus Dapitan came to be under the jurisdiction of the courageous men of St. Ignatius and it was Father Pascual de Acu\u00f1a S.J. who started the Jesuit mission there.\n\nIn 1609, the squadron of Juan Juarez Gallinato S.J. defeated the Manguindanau Muslims in a ferocious battle near Dapitan.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dipolog.us/history.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-05-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404221351/http://www.dipolog.us/history.htm |archive-date=2007-04-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAlso in 1609, a permanent Dapitan mission was founded and thereafter headed by a Jesuit missionary, Father Pedro Gutierrez, marking Dapitan as the Center of Evangelization in Mindanao.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dipolog.us/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-05-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404221438/http://www.dipolog.us/ |archive-date=2007-04-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Mission stations were subsequently established later by the Jesuits in Zamboanga, [[Iligan]], [[History of Basilan|Basilan]] and [[Butuan]]. Outside of these areas, however, the whole of Mindanao remained untouched by the Spanish Cross.\n\n[[File:STA. CRUZ - (Punta Corro).JPG|thumb|upright|The Santa Cruz Marker (Punta Corro) is the spot where migrating Boholanos from the Visayas landed and established settlement.]]\nBy the 18th century, with the [[Armada Espa\u00f1ola#The roots of the Spanish Navy (15th century)|Spanish Naval Fleet]] anchored at Dapitan Bay, much of the piracy&mdash;now conducted mainly by [[Moro people|moro]] bandits&mdash;was under control within the [[Sulu Sea]]. Settlement in coastal areas resumed with new settlers from Negros and Bohol eventually settling in Isab, and Nipaan. The largest settlement, however, was made at the mouth of the Dipolog river by the Boholanos who were not associated with Pagbuaya.\n\nFrom Ruiz, civil administration changed hands in stable succession, with Martino Belarmino, who was popular by the name Maglinte. Francisco Magallanes, Victorio Gobune; another man whose name history record had as Toribio had his chance, followed by Venancio Narvaez, Francisco Orbita, Bautista Narvaez, Martencio Yebes and Sabino Bengua.\n\nBy 1889, administrative designations reverted to ''Capitanes'', and those appointed were Martin Fernandez, Tomas Narvacan, Eustaquio Cajocon, Simplicio Lacaya, Basilio Tabiliran, Maximiano Ruiz and Bruno Ordinaria in 1898.\n\nBy February 1894, the Catholic Chapel constructed by the Jesuits was renovated for the first time, on an altar designed by Dr. [[Jos\u00e9 Rizal]] to which now stands the Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary Cathedral.\n\nBy 1896, the friars established Dipolog as a regular parish and installed Father Esteban Yepes its first administrator in 1897.\n\n===American regime===\nAfter the transfer of Spanish [[sovereignty]] to the United States in 1897, the U.S. occupation forces renamed the ''Capitan'' to Presidente Local, with administrative support from a Vice Presidente Local, a Delegado de Justicia and a Delegado de Policia.\nMartin Fernandez was appointed Presidente Local in the year 1900, followed by Diosdado Mercado, Gaudencio Zorilla and Isidro Patangan as Presidente Municipal between 1901 and March 1904.\n\nBy 1900, Dipolog was a thriving commercial community with new settlers arriving from the island of [[Cebu]], outgrowing its principal town of Dapitan which exclusively remained part of Pagbuaya's clan.\n\nBy 1910, John Helper, who was previously appointed Secretary of Zamboanga Province, visited Dipolog for two days and conversed with its [[principal\u00eda]] and members of the ''Centro Catolico de Dipolog''. He was asked later of the possibility of converting the [[barrio|community]] to an independent Municipality.\n\nBy 1912, Gov. [[John J. Pershing]] of the Department of Mindanao and Sulu decreed the separation of Dipolog from Dapitan.\n\nBy July 1, 1913, Gov. John J. Pershing declared Dipolog as a Municipality. General Pershing also appointed Pascual T. Martinez as its first Municipal Mayor.\n\nThe first public school teachers of Dipolog, during this time, came also from Bohol, particularly Maribojoc and other towns. Most were only elementary graduates. But they were well-educated by the American soldier-teachers in Bohol. One of them was a certain Felisa Ruaya who taught at the American-established schools in Dipolog. She lived first near the beach in Punta Coro. Then she married an Adriatico, a native of Polanco. Because the inhabitants converted to Christianity, it cannot be determined whether or not the residents were of Subanen heritage. Felisa Ruaya was the mother of former Zamboanga del Norte vice governor Concordio Ruaya Adriatico.\n\n===Japanese regime===\n\nIn 1942, Japanese Imperial Occupation forces entered in Dipolog and built of the military garrison of the Imperial Japanese Army was stationed in the municipality. In the same year, the seat of government of the [[Zamboanga (province)|historical province of Zamboanga]] was transferred from [[Zamboanga City]] to Dipolog.\n\nIn 1942 to 1945, Filipino troops of the Philippine Commonwealth Army military units and the local recognized guerrillas began the conflicts in the town municipality of Dipolog against the Japanese Imperial forces during the occupation was until the retreating local resistance fighters were halted by the Japanese after almost 4 years and before the American liberation forces returned and arrived in the town.\n\nIn 1945, the liberation by the Filipino troops under the 6th, 10th, 102nd and 105th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and 10th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary entered in Dipolog together with local guerrillas.\n\nGovernor [[Matias Ranillo Sr.|Matias Castillon Ranillo Sr.]] noticed that the waters at Punta Coro wharf were choppy for ships to anchor.  Governor Ranillo was determined to provide an alternative access to southern Zamboanga peninsula.  Governor Ranillo's jurisdiction was then the entire Zamboanga peninsula prior to its division between del Norte and del Sur.  During Governor Ranillo's term, aviation was a young technology but he made sure that an airfield was established in Dipolog.\n\nHe was elected Governor in 1937 and re-elected in 1940 but his term was cut short when Philippine President [[Manuel L. Quezon]] urged him to run as the lone Assemblyman of Zamboanga peninsula.  President Quezon fondly called him \"El Gallo Escondido de Malacanang\".  In November 1941, he was elected as Assemblyman but one week before his scheduled departure for Manila, World War II broke out. On October 30, 1944, upon the request of the recognized guerrillas among them the local regular and constable force of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Philippine Constabulary during the conflicts against the occupation, he mobilized the able-bodied men of Dipolog and Home guards who cheerfully volunteered to clear the airfield of grass and shrubs.\n\nOn March 8, 1945, on Dipolog airfield, the first American invasion of Zamboanga peninsula took place. The successful landing at Dipolog airfield established a base for the subsequent recapture of Japanese-held San Roque airfield near [[Zamboanga City]], followed by Sanga Sanga in [[Sulu]], and from there to Borneo and the East Indies. The army then established a general headquarters and military camp base of the [[Philippine Commonwealth Army]] and the [[Philippine Constabulary]] were stationed in Dipolog on March 9, 1945 to June 30, 1946 during the aftermath of [[World War II]].\n\n===Philippine Republic and Cityhood===\n[[File:ZANORTE Provincial Capitol.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The Zamboanga del Norte Provincial Capitol in Dipolog City prior to renovation, which was commenced by Governor Rolando E. Yebes in 2012, was postponed and later resumed renovation works by Governor Roberto Uy in 2018.]]\nIn 1952, Zamboanga province is separated into two provinces of [[Zamboanga del Norte]] and [[Zamboanga del Sur]] through '''Republic Act 711'''. Dipolog became the capital of Zamboanga del Norte upon creation.\n\nBy June 21, 1969, through the effort of former Congressman Alberto Q. Ubay, Philippine President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] signed into law '''Republic Act 5520''' or \"'''Charter of the City of Dipolog'''\", making Dipolog a chartered city effective January 1, 1970. The date is both significant and historic as that coincided with the Apollo 11 launching which carried the first men to the moon on June 21, 1969.\nMayor Felicisimo Herrera was made the last Municipal Mayor (1963\u20131970) and the first City Mayor of Dipolog (1970\u20131978). On March 8, 1982 the Sangguniang Panlungsod adopted the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOBPnJSHipc  Dipolog City March] composed by Mrs. Antonina O. Romano as the City's official song.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census\n| cols = 2\n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Dipolog\n| 1903 = 5204\n| 1918 = 15982\n| 1939 = 31604\n| 1948 = 40618\n| 1960 = 32236\n| 1970 = 46368\n| 1975 = 48403\n| 1980 = 61919\n| 1990 = 79887\n| 1995 = 90777\n| 2000 = 99862\n| 2007 = 113118\n| 2010 = 120460\n| 2015 = 130759\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}\n}}\n\n==Economy==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}\n[[File:DipologFishMarket.jpg|left|thumb|Dipolog Fish Market]]\nThe city is now one of the major options for local investors from [[Cebu]], [[Dumaguete]], [[Cagayan de Oro]] and [[Davao City|Davao]] and for foreign nationalities from [[India]] and [[China]] investing in retail, tourism, services, manufacturing, trade, and wholesale. It is also abundant with natural resources in terms of agriculture with fishpond areas and fishing grounds; fish production with approximately 56 fish species being produced, as well as livestock production such as carabao, cattle, horse, goat and pig.\n\nPotential investment areas range from agri-based processing such as activated charcoal, desiccated coconut, broiler contract growing, livestock raising, cattle fattening; construction, furniture, marble, low-cost housing projects, feed mill; food processing or packaging such as meat and fish processing, mango processing and packaging.\n\nIn 2006, a study by the National Statistics Coordination Board (NSCB) found Dipolog City to be the wealthiest city ''per capita'' in the [[Zamboanga Peninsula]]. Within Dipolog, 23.15% of the population was estimated to be living below the poverty line (households with a per capita expenditure of under $1 a day).

It is also the site for various celebrations and festivals in the city. In the third phase of the project, the length of the boulevard will be extended to reach the seaport in Barangay Galas.\n\n==Geography==\nDipolog City is known to be as the \"'''Gateway to Western Mindanao'''\" it is situated in the Northwestern part of the Province of [[Zamboanga del Norte]]. It is bounded on the north by [[Dapitan City]], on the east by the Municipality of [[Polanco, Zamboanga del Norte|Polanco]], on the south by the Municipality of [[Sergio Osme\u00f1a Sr., Zamboanga del Norte|Sergio Osme\u00f1a Sr.]] and on the west by the Municipality of [[Katipunan, Zamboanga del Norte|Katipunan]].\n\nIts land area in 1914 covered an approximate land area of 248,587 hectares under Act No. 302 of the Philippine Islands. It was substantially reduced in 1951 to the current 13,628 hectares, after two [[barrio]]s of Dipolog were converted into Municipalities of [[Polanco, Zamboanga del Norte|Polanco]], and [[Pi\u00f1an, Zamboanga del Norte|Pi\u00f1an]] under Executive Order of the President No. 467, dated August 22, 1951.\n\n===Barangays===\nDipolog City is politically subdivided into 21 [[barangay]]s.\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* Barra (Urban)\n* Biasong (Urban)\n* Central (Urban)\n* Cogon  (nature park)\n* Dicayas (Urban)\n* Diwan   (nature park)\n* Estaka (Urban)\n* Galas (Urban)\n* Gulayon (Urban)\n* Lugdungan  (suburban)\n* Minaog     (urban)\n* Miputak (Urban)\n* Olingan (Urban)\n* Punta      (suburban)\n* San Jose  (Agriculture)\n* Sangkol   (Agriculture)\n* Santa Filomena ( Urban)\n* Santa Isabel (Urban)\n* Sicayab (Urban)\n* Sinaman (Agriculture)\n* Turno (Urban)\n}}\n\n===Climate===\nDipolog has a [[tropical rainforest climate]], according to the K\u00f6ppen Climate classification with ample rain distributed quite evenly throughout the year and warm to hot temperatures.

At that time, ''Tulwanan's'' political territory was still part of the Municipality of Dapitan with Don Domingo Ruiz, a native, as its ''capit\u00e1n'' or town executive.\nSometime that year, a Spanish Recollect missionary arrived in Tulwanan looking for its [[barrio]] executive or local chieftain. Upon meeting a native, the missionary asked; \"\u00bfD\u00f3nde est\u00e1 el capit\u00e1n?\". The native understanding only the word \"capit\u00e1n\" pointed to the west and said in Subanen ''Di-pag'', meaning across the river. Guided by his servant, a Tagalog boy named Antonio Subido, the missionary proceeded down river and upon reaching the Boholano settlement, named the place \"Dipag\".\n\nTechnically, Dipag and Tulwanan were two different settlements at that time with the former composed of Boholano natives and the latter mostly of Subanen ancestry. When the friar returned to Dapitan, he identified the location of the larger Boholano settlement as Dipag but was not officially written. Frequent conversations by the Spaniards pronounced it in Spanish accent ''Dipolog'' which was eventually adopted by the natives. The final political survey surprisingly added the letter 'L' written on it after officially becoming a barrio of Dapitan. From that time Tulwanan's political identity ceased to exist.\nBy the 12th century the Subanen settlers had colonized most of what is now [[Zamboanga Peninsula]] region. It was customary for tribes to establish their settlements at the mouth of large river systems due to the abundant food supply. However, due to frequent raids from seafaring Chinese [[pirates]], they decided to move their settlements inland.\n\nIn the 14th century, '''Tulwanan''' was established 6 kilometers inland, adjoining the river near the present day ''barangay'' center of ''Lugdungan''.\n\nIn the 15th century, settlers from neighboring [[Negros Island|Negros]] and [[Bohol]] islands established coastline settlements in Mindanao but suffered the same raids by Chinese pirates, prompting them to also move their settlements away from the coastline. They established another settlement in what is now called Sianib, a ''barangay'' of present-day [[Polanco, Zamboanga del Norte|Polanco]] town, some twenty kilometers from the coast at Barrio Gulayon(Barangay Gulayon).\n\nIt was only in 1563 that the first recorded Visayan settlement of some 800 families from Bohol, led by the chieftain Datu Pagbuaya, landed in [[Mindanao]] and established a coastal settlement in what is now called [[Dapitan]]. This settlement was strong enough to repel the Chinese pirates of the Sulu Sea. As a result, Dapitan Bay was scene of many bloody conflicts between Pagbuaya's men and Chinese pirates.\n\n===Mindanao's first Christian settlement===\nIn 1565, Don [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi]] who was accompanied by famed navigator Fr. [[Andr\u00e9s de Urdaneta]], an Augustinian friar, visited the Boholano chieftain Datu Pagbuaya on the invitation of [[Datu Sikatuna]]. There they found the place of Datu Pagbuaya to be a thriving settlement. In his chronicle, Fr. Urdaneta named the place Daquepitan. [[Peter Kaerius]] (Pieter van den Keere) identified the location as ''Dapito'' in his cartographic map of 1598. It was later identified as \"Dapite\" in [[Robert Dudley (explorer)|Robert Dudley]]'s map of 1646. Other names ascribed to the location include \"Dapyto\" in Sanson's map of 1652 and \"Dapitan\" which can be found in [[Herman Moll|Moll]]'s map of the East Indies, 1729 and in Murillo Velarde's map of 1734. After [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi|Legazpi]]'s visit, the [[Christianization]] of Mindanao was officially initiated by the Augustinian friars who arrived with him.\n\nIn 1581, members of The [[Society of Jesus]] came to the Philippines for the purpose of evangelization. When the country was divided among four [[Religious order#Christian tradition|religious orders]] in 1598, the Jesuits were given the Diocese of Cebu which covered the Visayas and Mindanao. Thus Dapitan came to be under the jurisdiction of the courageous men of St. Ignatius and it was Father Pascual de Acu\u00f1a S.J. who started the Jesuit mission there.\n\nIn 1609, the squadron of Juan Juarez Gallinato S.J. defeated the Manguindanau Muslims in a ferocious battle near Dapitan.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dipolog.us/history.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-05-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404221351/http://www.dipolog.us/history.htm |archive-date=2007-04-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAlso in 1609, a permanent Dapitan mission was founded and thereafter headed by a Jesuit missionary, Father Pedro Gutierrez, marking Dapitan as the Center of Evangelization in Mindanao.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dipolog.us/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-05-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404221438/http://www.dipolog.us/ |archive-date=2007-04-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Mission stations were subsequently established later by the Jesuits in Zamboanga, [[Iligan]], [[History of Basilan|Basilan]] and [[Butuan]]. Outside of these areas, however, the whole of Mindanao remained untouched by the Spanish Cross.\n\n[[File:STA. CRUZ - (Punta Corro).JPG|thumb|upright|The Santa Cruz Marker (Punta Corro) is the spot where migrating Boholanos from the Visayas landed and established settlement.]]\nBy the 18th century, with the [[Armada Espa\u00f1ola#The roots of the Spanish Navy (15th century)|Spanish Naval Fleet]] anchored at Dapitan Bay, much of the piracy&mdash;now conducted mainly by [[Moro people|moro]] bandits&mdash;was under control within the [[Sulu Sea]]. Settlement in coastal areas resumed with new settlers from Negros and Bohol eventually settling in Isab, and Nipaan. The largest settlement, however, was made at the mouth of the Dipolog river by the Boholanos who were not associated with Pagbuaya.\n\nFrom Ruiz, civil administration changed hands in stable succession, with Martino Belarmino, who was popular by the name Maglinte. Francisco Magallanes, Victorio Gobune; another man whose name history record had as Toribio had his chance, followed by Venancio Narvaez, Francisco Orbita, Bautista Narvaez, Martencio Yebes and Sabino Bengua.\n\nBy 1889, administrative designations reverted to ''Capitanes'', and those appointed were Martin Fernandez, Tomas Narvacan, Eustaquio Cajocon, Simplicio Lacaya, Basilio Tabiliran, Maximiano Ruiz and Bruno Ordinaria in 1898.\n\nBy February 1894, the Catholic Chapel constructed by the Jesuits was renovated for the first time, on an altar designed by Dr. [[Jos\u00e9 Rizal]] to which now stands the Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary Cathedral.\n\nBy 1896, the friars established Dipolog as a regular parish and installed Father Esteban Yepes its first administrator in 1897.\n\n===American regime===\nAfter the transfer of Spanish [[sovereignty]] to the United States in 1897, the U.S. occupation forces renamed the ''Capitan'' to Presidente Local, with administrative support from a Vice Presidente Local, a Delegado de Justicia and a Delegado de Policia.\nMartin Fernandez was appointed Presidente Local in the year 1900, followed by Diosdado Mercado, Gaudencio Zorilla and Isidro Patangan as Presidente Municipal between 1901 and March 1904.\n\nBy 1900, Dipolog was a thriving commercial community with new settlers arriving from the island of [[Cebu]], outgrowing its principal town of Dapitan which exclusively remained part of Pagbuaya's clan.\n\nBy 1910, John Helper, who was previously appointed Secretary of Zamboanga Province, visited Dipolog for two days and conversed with its [[principal\u00eda]] and members of the ''Centro Catolico de Dipolog''. He was asked later of the possibility of converting the [[barrio|community]] to an independent Municipality.\n\nBy 1912, Gov. [[John J. Pershing]] of the Department of Mindanao and Sulu decreed the separation of Dipolog from Dapitan.\n\nBy July 1, 1913, Gov. John J. Pershing declared Dipolog as a Municipality. General Pershing also appointed Pascual T. Martinez as its first Municipal Mayor.\n\nThe first public school teachers of Dipolog, during this time, came also from Bohol, particularly Maribojoc and other towns. Most were only elementary graduates. But they were well-educated by the American soldier-teachers in Bohol. One of them was a certain Felisa Ruaya who taught at the American-established schools in Dipolog. She lived first near the beach in Punta Coro. Then she married an Adriatico, a native of Polanco. Because the inhabitants converted to Christianity, it cannot be determined whether or not the residents were of Subanen heritage. Felisa Ruaya was the mother of former Zamboanga del Norte vice governor Concordio Ruaya Adriatico.\n\n===Japanese regime===\n\nIn 1942, Japanese Imperial Occupation forces entered in Dipolog and built of the military garrison of the Imperial Japanese Army was stationed in the municipality. In the same year, the seat of government of the [[Zamboanga (province)|historical province of Zamboanga]] was transferred from [[Zamboanga City]] to Dipolog.\n\nIn 1942 to 1945, Filipino troops of the Philippine Commonwealth Army military units and the local recognized guerrillas began the conflicts in the town municipality of Dipolog against the Japanese Imperial forces during the occupation was until the retreating local resistance fighters were halted by the Japanese after almost 4 years and before the American liberation forces returned and arrived in the town.\n\nIn 1945, the liberation by the Filipino troops under the 6th, 10th, 102nd and 105th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and 10th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary entered in Dipolog together with local guerrillas.\n\nGovernor [[Matias Ranillo Sr.|Matias Castillon Ranillo Sr.]] noticed that the waters at Punta Coro wharf were choppy for ships to anchor.  Governor Ranillo was determined to provide an alternative access to southern Zamboanga peninsula.  Governor Ranillo's jurisdiction was then the entire Zamboanga peninsula prior to its division between del Norte and del Sur.  During Governor Ranillo's term, aviation was a young technology but he made sure that an airfield was established in Dipolog.\n\nHe was elected Governor in 1937 and re-elected in 1940 but his term was cut short when Philippine President [[Manuel L. Quezon]] urged him to run as the lone Assemblyman of Zamboanga peninsula.  President Quezon fondly called him \"El Gallo Escondido de Malacanang\".  In November 1941, he was elected as Assemblyman but one week before his scheduled departure for Manila, World War II broke out. On October 30, 1944, upon the request of the recognized guerrillas among them the local regular and constable force of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Philippine Constabulary during the conflicts against the occupation, he mobilized the able-bodied men of Dipolog and Home guards who cheerfully volunteered to clear the airfield of grass and shrubs.\n\nOn March 8, 1945, on Dipolog airfield, the first American invasion of Zamboanga peninsula took place. The successful landing at Dipolog airfield established a base for the subsequent recapture of Japanese-held San Roque airfield near [[Zamboanga City]], followed by Sanga Sanga in [[Sulu]], and from there to Borneo and the East Indies. The army then established a general headquarters and military camp base of the [[Philippine Commonwealth Army]] and the [[Philippine Constabulary]] were stationed in Dipolog on March 9, 1945 to June 30, 1946 during the aftermath of [[World War II]].\n\n===Philippine Republic and Cityhood===\n[[File:ZANORTE Provincial Capitol.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The Zamboanga del Norte Provincial Capitol in Dipolog City prior to renovation, which was commenced by Governor Rolando E. Yebes in 2012, was postponed and later resumed renovation works by Governor Roberto Uy in 2018.]]\nIn 1952, Zamboanga province is separated into two provinces of [[Zamboanga del Norte]] and [[Zamboanga del Sur]] through '''Republic Act 711'''. Dipolog became the capital of Zamboanga del Norte upon creation.\n\nBy June 21, 1969, through the effort of former Congressman Alberto Q. Ubay, Philippine President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] signed into law '''Republic Act 5520''' or \"'''Charter of the City of Dipolog'''\", making Dipolog a chartered city effective January 1, 1970. The date is both significant and historic as that coincided with the Apollo 11 launching which carried the first men to the moon on June 21, 1969.\nMayor Felicisimo Herrera was made the last Municipal Mayor (1963\u20131970) and the first City Mayor of Dipolog (1970\u20131978). On March 8, 1982 the Sangguniang Panlungsod adopted the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOBPnJSHipc  Dipolog City March] composed by Mrs. Antonina O. Romano as the City's official song.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census\n| cols = 2\n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Dipolog\n| 1903 = 5204\n| 1918 = 15982\n| 1939 = 31604\n| 1948 = 40618\n| 1960 = 32236\n| 1970 = 46368\n| 1975 = 48403\n| 1980 = 61919\n| 1990 = 79887\n| 1995 = 90777\n| 2000 = 99862\n| 2007 = 113118\n| 2010 = 120460\n| 2015 = 130759\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}\n}}\n\n==Economy==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}\n[[File:DipologFishMarket.jpg|left|thumb|Dipolog Fish Market]]\nThe city is now one of the major options for local investors from [[Cebu]], [[Dumaguete]], [[Cagayan de Oro]] and [[Davao City|Davao]] and for foreign nationalities from [[India]] and [[China]] investing in retail, tourism, services, manufacturing, trade, and wholesale. It is also abundant with natural resources in terms of agriculture with fishpond areas and fishing grounds; fish production with approximately 56 fish species being produced, as well as livestock production such as carabao, cattle, horse, goat and pig.\n\nPotential investment areas range from agri-based processing such as activated charcoal, desiccated coconut, broiler contract growing, livestock raising, cattle fattening; construction, furniture, marble, low-cost housing projects, feed mill; food processing or packaging such as meat and fish processing, mango processing and packaging.\n\nIn 2006, a study by the National Statistics Coordination Board (NSCB) found Dipolog City to be the wealthiest city ''per capita'' in the [[Zamboanga Peninsula]]. Within Dipolog, 23.15% of the population was estimated to be living below the poverty line (households with a per capita expenditure of under $1 a day). In comparison, the NCSB estimated [[Zamboanga City]] and [[Pagadian]] as having poverty incidences of 23.81% and 27.15%, respectively. In startling contrast, the poverty rate for the entire province of [[Zamboanga del Norte]] (with individuals in both rural and urban settings) was estimated to be 40.36%. Zamboanga del Norte is one of the Philippines's poorest provinces with a [[poverty]] incidence rate of 64.6% in 2003, an increase from 47% in the 2000 statistical figures.<ref name=\"Poverty Incident\">{{cite web|title=Estimation of Local Poverty in the Philippines |url=http://www.nscb.gov.ph/poverty/sae/NSCB_LocalPovertyPhilippines.pdf |publisher=National Statistics Coordination Board, World Bank |accessdate=2007-10-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200705/http://www.nscb.gov.ph/poverty/sae/NSCB_LocalPovertyPhilippines.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-27 }}</ref>\n\n===Industry===\nDipolog City is best known for its bottled sardines production.

The day-to-day administration of the city is handled by the city administrator.\n\n== Culture ==\n\nDipolog shared much of its cultural history with the ancient town of [[Dapitan]] to which it once belonged. It traces its beginnings long before the Spanish  [[conquistador]]es  set foot on the island of Mindanao. Dipolog was previously known as '''Tulwanan''', in native language, literally meaning a ''settlement by the river''. Its earliest settlers all belonged to the ''Subanen Tribe'' called ''Subanon'' or river people with established religion founded in [[animism]]. These descended from the [[Austronesian]] peoples who roamed [[Mindanao]] and Southeast Asia via [[land bridge]]s as early as 30,000 years ago<ref name=\"healthalert\">{{cite web |title=A Brief History of the Philippines from a Filipino Perspective |url=http://www.tribo.org/history/history3.html |publisher=Health Action Information Network |accessdate=2007-04-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070518035713/http://www.tribo.org/history/history3.html |archivedate=2007-05-18 }}</ref> Later migrations of other tribes were made by water and took place over several thousand years.\n\n== Transportation ==\nTricycles, ''sikads'', and ''habal-habals'' are the primary modes of transportation in the city.\n\n[[File:Coast Dipolog City Philippines.jpg|thumb|Dipolog City Coastline]]\n\n===By Land===\nDipolog has its own bus terminal in Barangay Miputak.

It is also the venue for the annual \u201c''Katkat Sakripisyo''\u201d of Catholic devotees who perform their penitential rites during the Lenten Season.\n*'''Cogon Park''' - The Cogon Eco-Park is a 344-hectare reforestation area situated in Barangay Cogon established in 1958. Mature trees are growing wild in the area; species such as Mahogany, Teak, Yemane, Lumbayao, Molave, Acacia, Narra, Mayapis, Lauan, Narig, Tianong, Duguan, Lumbayao, Rattan and Nato. It is also one of the favorite camping sites of different mountaineering groups. Presently, under development in the area are the construction of Information Center, Subanen Valley, Picnic cottages, well landscaped ground at the entrance, parking area, aviary, and different cages for animals. Adjacent to Barangay Cogon is Barangay Diwan, part of the eco-tourism complex housing the Organization of International Spiritual and Cultural Advancement or OISCA Forest Park, a joint project of the OISCA of Japan, locally managed by Hiroshi Ikeda, and the City Government of Dipolog. It also houses the Dipolog OISCA Children's Forest Park. The most prominent feature of the park is the Sungkilaw Falls.\n*'''Casa Bernedo''' - a century-old house owned by the Filipino-Spanish Bernedo family, for tourists. Casa Bernedo is developed as Dipolog's Center for Culture and the Arts and the Dipolog City Tourism Office. The ground floor serves as a venue for visual arts and photography exhibits.\n*'''ONAY Museum''' - This is where the collection of nameplates, medals, pictures and other memorabilia of [[Alexander B. Yano|General Alexander Yano]], the 38th Chief-of-Staff of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]], and the first [[Mindanao]]-born general, is located. The name \"''ONAY''\" came from his last name in reverse.\n*'''Santa Cruz''' - The tall cross stands at Punta Corro, the spot where migrating Boholanos landed and to establish a settlement. The cross was erected by the settlers on [[Roodmas]], May 3, 1905, in thanksgiving for their safe journey. [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] was once said at the spot before the Spaniards established a chapel 1.5 kilometers inland along the town's center street (now Rizal Avenue). The town cathedral was later built in 1895 to replace the old church. Dr. [[Jos\u00e9 Rizal]] designed the high altar from a sketch requested by his former professor and former ''[[cur\u00e9]]'' of Dipolog, Fr. Jos\u00e9 Villaclara.\n*'''Dipolog City Hall''' - Built on July 1, 1913, under the administration of General [[John J. Pershing]]. The original design of the town wall was the exact replica of the town hall of [[Maribojoc, Bohol]], which was designed by the Americans. The original hall was exactly the same size that of Maribojoc's down to the size of the jail. But today the hall was expanded and its original design can not be seen anymore. It is located near the Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary Cathedral and the Plaza Magsaysay. The hall building was constructed under the administration of Mayor Fermin D. Kagatan. The corner street houses the Monument of Three Prominent Dipolognons namely Pascual T. Martinez, the first appointed Mayor of Dipolog in 1913\u20131918; Rev. Fr. Nicasio Y. Patangan, the first Filipino Diocesan Priest of Mindanao; and Eugenio R. Margate, a farmer for 25 years who introduced the Margate System of Planting Rice.\n*'''P'gsalabuk Circle''' - Located at Estaka-Turno road junction is the Fountain of Blessings. P'gsalabuk is a Subanen (Lumad) term which means \"togetherness\". The statues represent the tri-people of Mindanao, which symbolize the diverse cultures prevailing in Dipolog. The bowl raised to heavens is a gesture of thanksgiving and offering to God Almighty for the generous outpouring of graces and blessings, bountiful harvests and sustained peace and prosperity.\n*'''Dipolog Boholana Handicraft & Pasalubong''' (formerly S and J)- Located at Gen Luna St. Cor Magsaysay near Dipolog Boulevard, Dipolog City, they sell Souvenir products and remembrance products. Tourists are welcome to visit and take a look at the shop's products. The souvenir shop is visited by many tourists, both local and foreign. It is owned by Elsa Leones. In late 2010 the original S and J is supposed to be located at Bonifacio Street but then transferred. It is also the premier pasalubong and souvenir store in the province.\n*'''[[Dipolog Boulevard]]''' - known as the Foreshore Development and Wellness Center, it is an esplanade in Dipolog. It is a future-proof esplanade which involves the development of 1.6 kilometers stretch of foreshore area spanning from Santa Cruz of Barangay Central to Purok Bularan of Barangay Miputak, and will soon reach the future '''Dipolog City Port Area''' (formerly Galas Feeder Port) in Barangay Galas. Equipped with adequate facilities like basketball courts and playground park, the city's boulevard serves as a tourist destination for every young and old to enjoy. It is also the site of the annual \"Pagsalabuk Festival\", motor company trade shows, and sporting events like marathons, triathlons, and dragon boat racing as part of the '''DIPOLOG SPORTS CITY 2020''' vision. Extension is currently underway to extend the boulevard for another kilometer reaching the seaport of Galas making it a total of 2.6 kilometers. When completed, it is expected to contribute in the expansion of commercial activities and protection of coastal areas of the city against large sea waves during typhoon periods.\n**'''Boulevard Commercial Complex''' - a two-building structure which is a host to prospective locators who wish to do business in the area, augmenting the presently existing restaurants, bars, and several food and beverage peddlers.\n**'''Explore Dipolog Landmark''' - features the slogan of the same line.

The Nye Beach [[historic overlay district]] is bounded on the north and south sides by Northwest Twelfth Street and Southwest Second Street respectively; on the east side by Hurbert Street and on the west side by the Pacific Ocean.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nye Beach Design Review District Overlay Map|publisher=City of Newport|url=http://newportoregon.gov/dept/cdd/documents/NyeBeachOverlay.pdf|year=2014|format=PDF|accessdate=November 22, 2014}}</ref> Situated on a sea cliff, the district has been a popular vacation spot since the late 19th century. Cultural and literary groups such as Oregon Coast Council for the Arts, Yaquina Art Association, and Writers on the Edge are based in Nye Beach, as are Newport's Performing Arts and Visual Arts Centers. The beach attracts tide-pool enthusiasts and beachcombers as well as surfers, sail-boarders, crabbers, clam diggers, kite flyers, photographers, and artists and has also been the site of marine and geological research projects.\n\n==A changing coastline==\nIn the early 1800s, the beach that would become Nye Beach was demarcated to the south by the [[Yaquina River]] and a rocky outcropping known as [[Jump-off Joe]]. In those days, Jump-off Joe extended into the sea and posed an obstacle to beach traffic. By the mid-20th century, [[coastal erosion]] had caused the [[sea stack]] to separate from the cliff, develop an arch, and finally crumble, leaving only a scattering of rock formations to mark the spot.<ref name = \"100 Years\">{{cite web|title=Erosion of a Sea Stack Over 100 Years|url=http://walrus.wr.usgs.gov/pubinfo/jump.html|publisher=United States Geological Survey|accessdate=November 22, 2014}}</ref> Without this natural barrier nothing remains to separate Nye Beach from [[Agate Beach State Recreation Site]] to the north.<ref name=\"Bannan\">{{cite book|title = Oregon State Parks |author=Bannan, Jan |edition = 2nd |year = 2002   |publisher = The Mountaineers Books |location= Seattle, Washington|isbn = 0-89886-794-0 |pages = 78\u201379}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Jumpoff Joe 1910.gif|thumbnail|Jump-off Joe and Nye Beach in 1910]]\n\nSince the demise of Jump-off Joe, at least one (and possibly more) similar, but less imposing, outcroppings have appeared, carved by coastal erosion from the sea cliff. \"Slipper Rock,\" a few hundred feet south of the original Jump-off Joe, resembled its predecessor, complete with arch, and in time met a similar fate. A 2004 geological report on the Oregon coast refers to the entire slide area north of Nye Creek as the Jump-off Joe landslide block.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Priest, George R.|author2=Allan, Johnathan C.|title=Evaluation Of Coastal Erosion Hazard Zones Along Dune and Bluff Backed Shorelines in Lincoln County, Oregon: Cascade Head To Seal Rock, Technical Report to Lincoln County|url=http://www.thecityofnewport.net/dept/pln/documents/DOGAMI_Report_000.pdf|publisher=Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries|year=2004|page=84|accessdate=November 22, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1942 a landslide took out about {{convert|15|acre|ha|0}} of coastal land and downed a number of houses at the Jump-off Joe site; other homes in the area were undermined by subsequent erosion.<ref>Disse, Diane M., Weeber, Jodi A., Harrison, Loretta, Lincolln County Historical Society  ''Images of America: Newport''. Arcadia Publishing, 2010</ref>\n\nIn 1980 a condominium development under construction near the \"Slipper\" site also collapsed.\n\nRemnants of both events can still be seen. Broken cement walls and footings in the Slipper area are visible from the sea.\n\nJump-off Joe was a significant coastal feature, like its more stable neighbor, [[Yaquina Head]]. Yaquina Head is mainly composed of [[basalt]] and [[breccia]], susceptible to erosion at a much slower rate than the [[sandstone]] of Jump-off Joe.<ref name=\"100 Years\"/>\n\n==History==\nIn the early 1800s, the coastal land that became Nye Beach was part of the sprawling [[Coast Indian Reservation]]. By 1865, the Indian population of the area was severely diminished and so the United States government opened it for [[Homestead Acts|homesteading]].<ref>[http://www.ohs.org/education/oregonhistory/narratives/subtopic.cfm?subtopic_ID=565 Oregon History Project: Wells, Gail, Capital, Transportation, and Technology Transform the Economy: Taking Back the Indians' Reservation Land, 2006]</ref>\n\nJohn Nye homesteaded the Nye Creek area in 1865, when it was a semi-wilderness. At the time, Yaquina Bay frontage was the primary destination of visitors to Newport. Nye Beach lacked any approach by road and was edged by cliffs. A stream (Nye Creek), had carved an opening in the sea cliff, an access point that would become the heart of the Nye Beach district. This spot later became known as \"the Turnaround.\"\n\nBy the 1890s, summer vacationers found their way to Nye Creek. In 1891, a boardwalk connected Nye Creek to the bay front. Within two years, the boardwalk had become a road, and summer crowds gathered on the beach at Nye Creek for band concerts and other entertainment.\n\nNye Beach attracted artists, writers and students of natural science. This tradition dates back to 1896 when a four-day summer teachers' conference was held in Newport.  In 1897, a group of summer residents associated with various colleges and known as the Summer Educational Association (SEA) achieved the building of an auditorium in the Nye Creek area. Summer teaching sessions were held for four seasons between 1897 and 1902. Classes in \"Science, Music, Mirth, Art and Religion\" were offered. SEA summer sessions were discontinued in 1903, but the reputation of Nye Creek as a mecca for the literary, scholarly and artistic was established. The SEA auditorium fell into disuse and was demolished in 1910, its lumber probably reused to build summer cabins.<ref>Price, Richard L. Newport, Oregon 1866-1936 - Portrait of a Coast, Richard L Price, 1975</ref>\n\n[[File:New Cliff House - Newport Oregon.jpg|thumb|The [[New Cliff House]] (Sylvia Beach Hotel) in Nye Beach is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].]] By the close of the 19th century, numerous summer cottages populated the area and camping enthusiasts pitched tents in campgrounds established along Nye Creek. By 1902 shops began to appear, soon followed by boarding houses, hotels and recreational attractions. The [[New Cliff House|Cliff House Hotel]], completed in 1913, still stands on a Nye Beach sea cliff, having morphed first into the Hotel Gilmore (1921) and again in 1986 into a whimsical haven for readers and writers, the Sylvia Beach Hotel.<ref>[http://www.pdxhistory.com/html/newport.html#Table30 PDX History: The Cliff House]</ref>\n\nIn 1901 a bath house (offering changing rooms for surf bathers) was erected at the Nye Creek beach entrance.\n\nIn 1902 Henry J. Minthorn, a physician with an interest in hot springs and [[Sanitorium|sanitoria]], moved to Newport and set up ocean-water baths. He practiced medicine in the city through 1922.<ref name=\"Dictionary\">{{cite book|author=Corning, Howard McKinley|title=Dictionary of Oregon History|publisher=Binford & Mort|location=Portland|edition=2nd|year=1989|origyear=1956|page=167|isbn=0-8323-0449-2}}</ref>\n\nIn 1911 the bath house at Nye Creek was demolished and replaced by a [[natatorium]], offering heated sea-water bathing and sunbathing rooms. It remained a popular attraction for decades. Destroyed by fire in 1922, it was promptly rebuilt. The reconstructed natatorium had an elaborate domed roof and besides the swimming pool, offered a dance hall, movie theater, bowling, and roller skating.\n\nEventually the Natatorium lost popularity and fell into disrepair. A photo from 1966 shows it with a \"4-SALE\" sign. It was eventually demolished and the vacant grounds became a picnic area and parking lot at the Nye Beach Turnaround. All that remains of the former complex is one building that used to provide public restrooms, but is now the Yaquina Art Gallery.<ref>[http://users.wi.net/~census/lesson36.html Sovereigns of Themselves: A Liberating History of Oregon and Its Coast Volume III, abridged online edition, 2008]</ref>\n\nBy the mid-1920s, during [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]], Newport had paved streets and curbs, and a cement breakwater was under construction. The enthusiastic building of vacation beach cottages continued through 1920s, with guests arriving from Albany by train, ferryboat, and \"coaches\" (buses). Visitors to Nye Creek could choose lodgings from the Rose City Cottages, the Panama Cottages, the Sunny Side, the Cherry City Cottages, the Hub Cottages, Sunset Cottages, Linger Longer Lodge, the Model Campground, the Nicolai Hotel and the Hotel Gilmore.\n\nEarly transportation to Newport had relied mainly on rail, with trains from [[Albany, Oregon|Albany]] arriving at [[Yaquina City, Oregon|Yaquina City]], where passengers could board a ferryboat to Yaquina Bay. Optimism for Newport's early growth was based on the expectation that the railway would eventually reach Newport. It never did. In 1928, the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] stopped service to Yaquina City. This may have put a temporary damper on the tourist business, but by 1930 highway projects were underway that would make the area more accessible than ever.\n\nConstruction of the [[Roosevelt Highway (Oregon)|\"Roosevelt\" Highway (now Coast Highway)]] began in 1919. It was to run the length of the Oregon Coast. Newport would soon have a highway connection with Lincoln City to the north and with Waldport to the south (though ferries were required to cross both Yaquina Bay and Alsea Bay).\n\nThe new Salmon River Highway (now Highway 18) would connect Grand Ronde and Otis (north of Lincoln City), opening a new route to the coastal highway.\n\nBy 1936 bridges across the Rogue River, Alsea River, Yaquina Bay, Coos Bay, and Umpqua River were all complete and the Oregon Coast was fully accessible to automobile traffic.\n\nThroughout the 1940s,  Nye Beach continued to evolve its unique character. During World War II, the beach was patrolled by blimps and by local citizens with dogs and rifles, guarding the country from the threat of marine invasion. Also in the 1940s some distinctive homes were built, contributing to what became known as the \"Nye Beach style.\" Many of these homes have endured, for example, the Grand Victorian, now a bed-and-breakfast.\n\nThe Graphic Novel ''Gilmore By the Sea'' by Ed Cameron describes 1980s Nye Beach as a rough and tumble neighborhood.<ref>[http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/index.ssf/2011/07/graphic_novel_chronicles_a_time_gone_by_at_newports_gilmore_by_the_sea_hotel.html Graphic novel chronicles a time gone by at Newport's 'Gilmore by the Sea' hotel]</ref> But by the twenty-first century, Nye Beach was on its way to becoming a self-conscious community with its own merchant organization, modern architecture and community cultural events. In 2007 the multimillion-dollar ''Archway Place'' with upscale shopping at ground level and costly condos on its second and third floors was constructed on the former site of ''Cozy Corner Confectionery'' (a 1920s grocery). Similar projects followed. The densely commercial Coast Street was refurbished with retro paving stones and custom curbs.

In 1859 he headed west with a team oxen which he traded for horses in Salt Lake City, Utah. He reached Corvallis, Oregon in 1860. After plying several trades, including a stint at the Rock Creek mines in British Columbia, soldiering in the Union Army, and road building on present-day Highway 20, he found his way to the Oregon coast.\n\nIn 1865 he acquired a homestead on the section of land known afterward as Nye Creek and later as Nye Beach. He built a cabin at what would be the corner of Brook and Third Streets in Nye Beach. He probably attempted mining the creek, which ran by his cabin. After 19 months, he had fulfilled the homestead residence requirement. Then he traveled to Indiana, married Olive Kist, returned to Oregon and settled for a time in Corvallis. When Nye had his coastal property platted, he named Olive Street after his bride. In 1874 the Nyes returned to Newport, moving onto another homestead property, east of town. On those {{convert|160|acre|ha}}, he and Olive farmed, raised eight children, and lived for the rest of their lives.\n\nJohn Nye sold the Nye Creek claim to developer Sam Irvin in 1880.<ref>[http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=sbenton&id=I23284 Pioneers of Benton County: John Nye]</ref> Irvin promoted Newport tourism in the 1880s.\n\n===Ed Seidler===\nIn 1901 Ed Seidler built the original bathhouse at Nye Creek, now the Nye Beach Turnaround.\n\n===John Minthorn===\nIn 1902 Minthorn, a physician, established a sanitarium in Nye Creek.

The Nye Beach [[historic overlay district]] is bounded on the north and south sides by Northwest Twelfth Street and Southwest Second Street respectively; on the east side by Hurbert Street and on the west side by the Pacific Ocean.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nye Beach Design Review District Overlay Map|publisher=City of Newport|url=http://newportoregon.gov/dept/cdd/documents/NyeBeachOverlay.pdf|year=2014|format=PDF|accessdate=November 22, 2014}}</ref> Situated on a sea cliff, the district has been a popular vacation spot since the late 19th century. Cultural and literary groups such as Oregon Coast Council for the Arts, Yaquina Art Association, and Writers on the Edge are based in Nye Beach, as are Newport's Performing Arts and Visual Arts Centers. The beach attracts tide-pool enthusiasts and beachcombers as well as surfers, sail-boarders, crabbers, clam diggers, kite flyers, photographers, and artists and has also been the site of marine and geological research projects.\n\n==A changing coastline==\nIn the early 1800s, the beach that would become Nye Beach was demarcated to the south by the [[Yaquina River]] and a rocky outcropping known as [[Jump-off Joe]]. In those days, Jump-off Joe extended into the sea and posed an obstacle to beach traffic. By the mid-20th century, [[coastal erosion]] had caused the [[sea stack]] to separate from the cliff, develop an arch, and finally crumble, leaving only a scattering of rock formations to mark the spot.<ref name = \"100 Years\">{{cite web|title=Erosion of a Sea Stack Over 100 Years|url=http://walrus.wr.usgs.gov/pubinfo/jump.html|publisher=United States Geological Survey|accessdate=November 22, 2014}}</ref> Without this natural barrier nothing remains to separate Nye Beach from [[Agate Beach State Recreation Site]] to the north.<ref name=\"Bannan\">{{cite book|title = Oregon State Parks |author=Bannan, Jan |edition = 2nd |year = 2002   |publisher = The Mountaineers Books |location= Seattle, Washington|isbn = 0-89886-794-0 |pages = 78\u201379}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Jumpoff Joe 1910.gif|thumbnail|Jump-off Joe and Nye Beach in 1910]]\n\nSince the demise of Jump-off Joe, at least one (and possibly more) similar, but less imposing, outcroppings have appeared, carved by coastal erosion from the sea cliff. \"Slipper Rock,\" a few hundred feet south of the original Jump-off Joe, resembled its predecessor, complete with arch, and in time met a similar fate. A 2004 geological report on the Oregon coast refers to the entire slide area north of Nye Creek as the Jump-off Joe landslide block.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Priest, George R.|author2=Allan, Johnathan C.|title=Evaluation Of Coastal Erosion Hazard Zones Along Dune and Bluff Backed Shorelines in Lincoln County, Oregon: Cascade Head To Seal Rock, Technical Report to Lincoln County|url=http://www.thecityofnewport.net/dept/pln/documents/DOGAMI_Report_000.pdf|publisher=Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries|year=2004|page=84|accessdate=November 22, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1942 a landslide took out about {{convert|15|acre|ha|0}} of coastal land and downed a number of houses at the Jump-off Joe site; other homes in the area were undermined by subsequent erosion.<ref>Disse, Diane M., Weeber, Jodi A., Harrison, Loretta, Lincolln County Historical Society  ''Images of America: Newport''. Arcadia Publishing, 2010</ref>\n\nIn 1980 a condominium development under construction near the \"Slipper\" site also collapsed.\n\nRemnants of both events can still be seen. Broken cement walls and footings in the Slipper area are visible from the sea.\n\nJump-off Joe was a significant coastal feature, like its more stable neighbor, [[Yaquina Head]]. Yaquina Head is mainly composed of [[basalt]] and [[breccia]], susceptible to erosion at a much slower rate than the [[sandstone]] of Jump-off Joe.<ref name=\"100 Years\"/>\n\n==History==\nIn the early 1800s, the coastal land that became Nye Beach was part of the sprawling [[Coast Indian Reservation]]. By 1865, the Indian population of the area was severely diminished and so the United States government opened it for [[Homestead Acts|homesteading]].<ref>[http://www.ohs.org/education/oregonhistory/narratives/subtopic.cfm?subtopic_ID=565 Oregon History Project: Wells, Gail, Capital, Transportation, and Technology Transform the Economy: Taking Back the Indians' Reservation Land, 2006]</ref>\n\nJohn Nye homesteaded the Nye Creek area in 1865, when it was a semi-wilderness. At the time, Yaquina Bay frontage was the primary destination of visitors to Newport. Nye Beach lacked any approach by road and was edged by cliffs. A stream (Nye Creek), had carved an opening in the sea cliff, an access point that would become the heart of the Nye Beach district. This spot later became known as \"the Turnaround.\"\n\nBy the 1890s, summer vacationers found their way to Nye Creek. In 1891, a boardwalk connected Nye Creek to the bay front. Within two years, the boardwalk had become a road, and summer crowds gathered on the beach at Nye Creek for band concerts and other entertainment.\n\nNye Beach attracted artists, writers and students of natural science. This tradition dates back to 1896 when a four-day summer teachers' conference was held in Newport.  In 1897, a group of summer residents associated with various colleges and known as the Summer Educational Association (SEA) achieved the building of an auditorium in the Nye Creek area. Summer teaching sessions were held for four seasons between 1897 and 1902. Classes in \"Science, Music, Mirth, Art and Religion\" were offered. SEA summer sessions were discontinued in 1903, but the reputation of Nye Creek as a mecca for the literary, scholarly and artistic was established. The SEA auditorium fell into disuse and was demolished in 1910, its lumber probably reused to build summer cabins.<ref>Price, Richard L. Newport, Oregon 1866-1936 - Portrait of a Coast, Richard L Price, 1975</ref>\n\n[[File:New Cliff House - Newport Oregon.jpg|thumb|The [[New Cliff House]] (Sylvia Beach Hotel) in Nye Beach is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].]] By the close of the 19th century, numerous summer cottages populated the area and camping enthusiasts pitched tents in campgrounds established along Nye Creek. By 1902 shops began to appear, soon followed by boarding houses, hotels and recreational attractions. The [[New Cliff House|Cliff House Hotel]], completed in 1913, still stands on a Nye Beach sea cliff, having morphed first into the Hotel Gilmore (1921) and again in 1986 into a whimsical haven for readers and writers, the Sylvia Beach Hotel.<ref>[http://www.pdxhistory.com/html/newport.html#Table30 PDX History: The Cliff House]</ref>\n\nIn 1901 a bath house (offering changing rooms for surf bathers) was erected at the Nye Creek beach entrance.\n\nIn 1902 Henry J. Minthorn, a physician with an interest in hot springs and [[Sanitorium|sanitoria]], moved to Newport and set up ocean-water baths. He practiced medicine in the city through 1922.<ref name=\"Dictionary\">{{cite book|author=Corning, Howard McKinley|title=Dictionary of Oregon History|publisher=Binford & Mort|location=Portland|edition=2nd|year=1989|origyear=1956|page=167|isbn=0-8323-0449-2}}</ref>\n\nIn 1911 the bath house at Nye Creek was demolished and replaced by a [[natatorium]], offering heated sea-water bathing and sunbathing rooms. It remained a popular attraction for decades. Destroyed by fire in 1922, it was promptly rebuilt. The reconstructed natatorium had an elaborate domed roof and besides the swimming pool, offered a dance hall, movie theater, bowling, and roller skating.\n\nEventually the Natatorium lost popularity and fell into disrepair. A photo from 1966 shows it with a \"4-SALE\" sign. It was eventually demolished and the vacant grounds became a picnic area and parking lot at the Nye Beach Turnaround. All that remains of the former complex is one building that used to provide public restrooms, but is now the Yaquina Art Gallery.<ref>[http://users.wi.net/~census/lesson36.html Sovereigns of Themselves: A Liberating History of Oregon and Its Coast Volume III, abridged online edition, 2008]</ref>\n\nBy the mid-1920s, during [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]], Newport had paved streets and curbs, and a cement breakwater was under construction. The enthusiastic building of vacation beach cottages continued through 1920s, with guests arriving from Albany by train, ferryboat, and \"coaches\" (buses). Visitors to Nye Creek could choose lodgings from the Rose City Cottages, the Panama Cottages, the Sunny Side, the Cherry City Cottages, the Hub Cottages, Sunset Cottages, Linger Longer Lodge, the Model Campground, the Nicolai Hotel and the Hotel Gilmore.\n\nEarly transportation to Newport had relied mainly on rail, with trains from [[Albany, Oregon|Albany]] arriving at [[Yaquina City, Oregon|Yaquina City]], where passengers could board a ferryboat to Yaquina Bay. Optimism for Newport's early growth was based on the expectation that the railway would eventually reach Newport. It never did. In 1928, the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] stopped service to Yaquina City. This may have put a temporary damper on the tourist business, but by 1930 highway projects were underway that would make the area more accessible than ever.\n\nConstruction of the [[Roosevelt Highway (Oregon)|\"Roosevelt\" Highway (now Coast Highway)]] began in 1919. It was to run the length of the Oregon Coast. Newport would soon have a highway connection with Lincoln City to the north and with Waldport to the south (though ferries were required to cross both Yaquina Bay and Alsea Bay).\n\nThe new Salmon River Highway (now Highway 18) would connect Grand Ronde and Otis (north of Lincoln City), opening a new route to the coastal highway.\n\nBy 1936 bridges across the Rogue River, Alsea River, Yaquina Bay, Coos Bay, and Umpqua River were all complete and the Oregon Coast was fully accessible to automobile traffic.\n\nThroughout the 1940s,  Nye Beach continued to evolve its unique character. During World War II, the beach was patrolled by blimps and by local citizens with dogs and rifles, guarding the country from the threat of marine invasion. Also in the 1940s some distinctive homes were built, contributing to what became known as the \"Nye Beach style.\" Many of these homes have endured, for example, the Grand Victorian, now a bed-and-breakfast.\n\nThe Graphic Novel ''Gilmore By the Sea'' by Ed Cameron describes 1980s Nye Beach as a rough and tumble neighborhood.<ref>[http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/index.ssf/2011/07/graphic_novel_chronicles_a_time_gone_by_at_newports_gilmore_by_the_sea_hotel.html Graphic novel chronicles a time gone by at Newport's 'Gilmore by the Sea' hotel]</ref> But by the twenty-first century, Nye Beach was on its way to becoming a self-conscious community with its own merchant organization, modern architecture and community cultural events. In 2007 the multimillion-dollar ''Archway Place'' with upscale shopping at ground level and costly condos on its second and third floors was constructed on the former site of ''Cozy Corner Confectionery'' (a 1920s grocery). Similar projects followed. The densely commercial Coast Street was refurbished with retro paving stones and custom curbs. Two cement archways were constructed over the approach to the Turnaround and behind the Visual Arts Center.\n\nFew of the historic cottages survived. Some are rentals or shops, though most have fallen to the demand for renovation. Many were replaced in the 1980s by condominiums. Others later yielded ground to modern hotels like the ''Elizabeth Street Inn'' and the Inn at Nye Beach], the first hotel on the Oregon coast designed to minimize its environmental impact via such things as a 58-panel solar array that can produce over 16,000 watts of electricity.<ref>http://www.innatnyebeach.com/green-initiatives.php</ref> Built in 2010, the Inn at Nye Beach (formerly the Greenstone Inn) acquired the site of the original Hub Cottages (later known as the Viking's Cottages, for decades the oldest continuously operating motel in Oregon).\n\nIn the 21st century, the Performing Arts Center(1988) and the Visual Arts Center(1985) share their neighborhood with the Yaquina Art Gallery.  Rare book stores, boutiques, an astrologer, spas, galleries, bistros, pubs, wine shops, and restaurants share the scene with an animal hospital, a historic laundry, a real estate office, and an ambulance service.\n\n==People==\n\n===John Nye===\nJohn Nye was Born in Ohio in 1832.
