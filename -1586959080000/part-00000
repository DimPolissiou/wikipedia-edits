Continuing the work in the recognising of and the treating of rejection, she also looked at methods in lessening drug side effects.<ref name=\"Stanford2013\" /><ref name=StanfordBio/>\nShe later recalled; <blockquote>When patients started living longer, the surgeons felt they needed real doctors to take care of them because they would come in for follow up with all sorts of medical complications of long-term immunosuppression.<ref name=Stanford2013/> </blockquote>\n\nContinuing the process, which started in 1973, of monitoring acute rejection after heart transplants by taking biopsies of the heart using a [[bioptome]] and then examining the samples under the microscope, has in her professional view been one of the most significant contributions to detecting rejection.<ref name=\"npr50\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/01/06/576197731/marking-50-years-since-the-first-american-heart-transplant|title=Marking 50 Years Since The First Adult Heart Transplant In The U.S.|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=3 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nHunt is known by a number of her colleagues as the \"mother of transplant\",<ref name=ishltinterview2011/> having been involved in major transplant guidelines including the \"2009 Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Heart Failure in Adults\u201d.<ref name=ishltinterview2011/>\n\nIn her paper on mechanical circulatory support in 2007, she stated that the grading of \u201ctransplant ineligible\u201d at one moment in time is not automatically a permanent decision.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=oA3iDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA1 McKellar, Shelley (2017), p.153]</ref>\n\nIn 2013, Hunt described one-year survival rates of 90% with many living for over thirty years.<ref name=Stanford2013/>\n\n===Mechanical assist devices===\nHunt was involved in the care of Robert St. Laurent, the case of the world's first successful implantation of an LVAD, as a [[bridge to transplantation]], in 1984.<ref name=ishltinterview2011/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.stanford.edu/news/2004/april14/transplant.html|title=Heart transplant reunion party celebrates lifesaving milestone|website=news.stanford.edu|access-date=4 September 2018}}</ref> The device used was the \u201cNovacor\u201d (left ventricular assist system), which used an electromechanically driven dual pusher-plate blood pump.

The old Maglaj, like numerous other cities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, has an old town with mosques, traditional houses dating back from the [[Ottoman Empire]], and a fortress that stands as a symbol of Maglaj. The new part of Maglaj, situated on the West side of the river [[Bosna (river)|Bosna]], is made up of modern architecture that was started in the 1950s, and became massively developed until 1991.\n\nThe Bosna flows through Maglaj on its way north to the [[Sava]] river on the border between Bosnia and Herzegovina and [[Croatia]]. Before the [[Bosnian War]], the Bosna river was heavily polluted due to heavy industrial activity at the nearby [[Natron]] paper and pulp factory, as well as steel and wood industry factories in the southern cities of [[Zenica]] and [[Zavidovi\u0107i]] respectively. Nowadays, the river has become cleaner due to decreased industrial activity at those plants and higher environmental standards.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{unsourced|section|date=September 2018}}\nThe city, as well as the entire Maglaj municipality, have been subject to a large demographic population shift.  Close to all of its pre-war Christian inhabitants, i.e. [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Orthodox Serbs]] and [[Roman Catholicism in Croatia|Catholic Croats]], who made up the majority of the pre-war municipality population, no longer reside in the Maglaj municipality. \n\nThe Orthodox population has largely settled in the [[Doboj]] and [[Modri\u010da]] regions of the [[Republika Srpska]], while the Catholic population has settled in the nearby municipality of [[\u017dep\u010de]], an enclave inhabited largely by Croats. A significant number of former Croat inhabitants have also settled in Croatia's capital [[Zagreb]]. \n\nDue to the severe fighting around Maglaj throughout the Bosnian War, and the catastrophic conditions it was exposed to, numerous [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]] Muslims have departed the region as well.\n\nPre-war Maglaj was unique because over one third of its married couples were made up of mixed ethnic groups. As a result of this, a great number of these Maglaj inhabitants felt welcome by none of the three warring ethnic groups, and tried to settle abroad. Consequentially, Maglaj residents have dispersed.\n\n==History==\nMaglaj originated in the 14th century. The [[river Bosna]] goes through this town.\n\nFrom 1929 to 1941, Maglaj was part of the [[Vrbas Banovina]] of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].\n\nThe city endured a long siege by [[Bosnian Serb]]s forces between 1993 and 1994 during the [[Bosnian War]], when the area was the scene of heavy fighting and the population had to be supplied by [[airdrop]]s.\n\nThe last flooding occurred on May 16, 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|title = In Pictures: Severe flooding in Bosnia|url = http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/inpictures/2014/05/pictures-severe-flooding-bosnia-20145201694397896.html|website = www.aljazeera.com|accessdate = 2015-06-03|first = Lejla|last = Osmic}}</ref> Although little floods occur every year, the 2014 flood was major, people lost their homes and belongings.\n\n==Notable residents==\n*[[Admir Hasan\u010di\u0107]], former football player\n*[[Alma \u010card\u017ei\u0107]], singer\n*[[Bahrudin \u010cengi\u0107]], film director and screenwriter\n*[[\u0160emsa Suljakovi\u0107]], singer\n*[[Edhem Mulabdi\u0107]], Writer\n*[[Ru\u017ea Toma\u0161i\u0107]], politician and [[European Parliament]] member\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Maglaj}}\n*http://www.maglaj.net/\n*[http://www.bhtourism.ba/eng/tbk.wbsp Tragovima bosanskog kraljevstva] - Tourist route for medieval Bosnia (English)\n*[http://www.bosnia.ba/ Trail of the Bosnian Kingdom] - Cultural Tourism in Tesanj\n\n{{Political divisions of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}\n{{Zenica-Doboj Canton}}\n{{Maglaj municipality}}\n{{coord|44|33|N|18|06|E|region:BA_type:city|display=title}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Maglaj| ]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Maglaj]]\n", "text_old": "{{More references|date=March 2016}}\n{{Infobox settlement <!--more fields are available for this Infobox--See Template:Infobox Settlement-->\n|official_name = Maglaj\n|settlement_type = [[List of cities in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Town]] and [[Municipalities of Bosnia and Herzegovina|municipality]]\n|image_skyline = Maglaj (collage).jpg\n|subdivision_type = [[Countries of the world|Country]]\n|subdivision_name       = [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]\n|subdivision_type1      = Entity\n|subdivision_name1      = [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|The Federation]]\n|subdivision_type2      = [[Cantons of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Canton]]\n|subdivision_name2      = [[Zenica-Doboj Canton|Zenica-Doboj]]\n|timezone=[[Central European Time|CET]]\n|utc_offset=+1\n|map_caption =Location of Maglaj within Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n|timezone_DST=[[Central European Summer Time|CEST]]\n|utc_offset_DST=+2\n|leader_title=Municipality&nbsp;president|\nnative_name = \u041c\u0430\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0458|\nimage_shield = Emblem of Maglaj.svg|\nimage_coat_of_arms_size = 100px|\n|\n|\nleader_name = Mirsad Mahmutagi\u0107 ([[Party of Democratic Action|SDP]])\n|area_total_km2 = 290\n|population_total = 24980\n|population_as_of = 2013 census\n| population_density_km2 = 86\nimage_map = Maglaj Municipality Location.svg|\n|pushpin_map            =Bosnia and Herzegovina\n|pushpin_label_position = <!-- the position of the pushpin label: left, right, top, bottom, none -->\n|pushpin_map_caption    =Location of Maglaj\n|pushpin_mapsize        =\n|coordinates            = {{coord|44|33|N|18|06|E|region:BA|display=inline}}\n|\narea_code = +387 32|\nparts = |\nwebsite = {{url|http://www.maglaj.net}}|\n}}\n'''Maglaj''' is a town and municipality located in [[Zenica-Doboj Canton]] of the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], an entity of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].

Mink was a third-generation [[Japanese American]], having been born and raised on the island of [[Maui]]. After graduating as [[valedictorian]] of the [[Maui High School]] class in 1944, she attended the [[University of Hawaii at M\u0101noa]] for two years and subsequently enrolled at the [[University of Nebraska]], where she experienced racism and worked to have [[Racial segregation|segregation]] [[Separate but equal|policies]] eliminated. After illness forced her to return to Hawaii to complete her studies there, she applied to 12 medical schools to continue her education, but was rejected by all of them. Following a suggestion by her employer, she opted to study law and was accepted at the [[University of Chicago Law School]] in 1948. While at university, she met and married [[World War II]] veteran and former [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] navigator John Francis Mink. When they graduated in 1951, Mink was unable to find employment as a married, Asian woman and after the birth of her daughter in 1952, the couple moved to Hawaii.\n\nWhen she was refused the right to take the bar examination, due to the loss of her Hawaiian residency upon marriage, Mink challenged the [[sexist]] statute. Though she won the right to take the test and passed the examination, no public or private firm would hire her because she was married and had a child. Mink's father helped her open her own practice in 1953 and around the same time she became a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. Hoping to work legislatively to change discriminatory customs through law, she worked as an attorney for the Hawaiian territorial legislature in 1955. The following year, she ran for a seat in the territorial [[Hawaii House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. Winning the race, she became the first Japanese-American woman to serve in the territorial House and two years later, the first woman to serve in the territorial [[Hawaii Senate|Senate]], when she won her campaign for the higher house. In 1960, Mink gained national attention when she spoke in favor of the [[Civil rights movement|civil rights platform]] at the [[Democratic National Convention]] in Los Angeles.\n\nIn 1964, Mink ran for federal office and won a seat in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]]. She was the first [[Person of color|woman of color]] and the first [[Asian American|Asian-American]] woman elected to Congress, and also the first woman elected to Congress from the state of [[Hawaii]]. She served a total of 12 terms, representing Hawaii's [[Hawaii's at-large congressional district|at-large]] and [[Second Congressional District of Hawaii|second]] congressional districts. While in Congress in the late 1960s, she introduced the first comprehensive initiatives under the [[Early Childhood Education Act]], which included the first federal child-care bill and worked on the [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act]] of 1965. In 1970, she became the first person to oppose a [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] nominee on the basis of discrimination against women. Mink initiated a lawsuit which led to significant changes to presidential authority under the [[Freedom of Information Act]] in 1971. In 1972, she co-authored the [[Title IX|Title IX Amendment of the Higher Education Act]], later renamed the Patsy T. Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act in 2002. \n\nMink was the first Asian-American woman to seek the presidential nomination of the Democratic Party. She ran in the [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 election]], standing in the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1972|Oregon primary]] as an anti-war candidate. She was [[Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs|Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs]] from 1977 to 1979. From 1980 to 1982, Mink served as the president of [[Americans for Democratic Action]] and then returned to Honolulu, where she was elected to the [[Honolulu City Council]], which she chaired until 1985. In 1990, she was again elected to the U.S. House, serving until her death in 2002. During her second six terms of office, she continued to work on legislation of importance to women, children, immigrants and minorities.\n\n== Family background ==\nPatsy Matsu Takemoto was born on December 6, 1927 at the sugar plantation camp, [[Hamakuapoko, Hawaii|H\u0101m\u0101kua Poko]], near [[Paia, Hawaii|Paia]], on the island of [[Maui]].{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|p=572}}{{sfn|Fugita|1999|p=246}} Her parents were second-generation Japanese Americans{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|p=573}} or ''[[Nisei]]''. She was a ''[[Sansei]]'', or third-generation descendant of Japanese emigrants.{{sfn|Nomura|1998|pp=288, 290}} Her mother, Mitama Tateyama, was a [[homemaker]],{{sfn|Fugita|1999|p=246}}{{sfn|Leavitt|1985|p=183}} and the daughter of Gojiro Tateyama and Tsuru Wakashige.{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|p=574}}{{sfn|FamilySearch|1905}} Their family, which had 11 children, lived in a [[shack]] by the Waikamoi Stream. William Pogue, Gojiro's employer, arranged to have Tateyama's daughters educated at the Maunaolu Seminary, a [[boarding school]] for [[Christians|Christian]] girls located in the town of [[Makawao, Hawaii|Makawao]].{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|p=574}}\n\nTakemoto's maternal grandparents were both born in the [[Empire of Japan]] during the 19th century.{{sfn|FamilySearch|1933}} Gojiro Tateyama arrived in the [[Territory of Hawaii]] late in the century, and was employed on a [[sugarcane]] [[Sugar plantations in Hawaii|plantation]]. He later moved to Maui, where he was initially employed as a worker for the [[East Maui Irrigation Company]]. Subsequently, he was employed as a [[store manager]] and [[filling station]] employee. He also delivered mail throughout the [[backcountry]] of Maui.{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|p=574}}\n\nHer father, Suematsu Takemoto, was a [[civil engineer]].{{sfn|Fugita|1999|p=246}}{{sfn|Leavitt|1985|p=183}} He graduated from the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]] in 1922, the first Japanese American to graduate from the University of Hawaii with a degree in civil engineering. For several years, he was the only Japanese-American civil engineer working at the sugar plantation in Maui.{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|p=573}} Suematsu was passed over for promotion to chief engineer several times during his career, the positions instead being offered to mostly [[white American]]s. He resigned his local position in 1945 in the aftermath of [[World War II]], and moved to [[Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu]] with his family, where he established his own [[Surveying|land surveying company]].{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|p=574}}\n\n== Early years and education ==\nTakemoto began her education at the H\u0101m\u0101kua Poko Grammar School when she was four and then transferred in 4th grade to the Kaunoa English Standard School{{sfn|Fugita|1999|p=246}} a mostly-white school attended only by students who could speak English and pass the entrance examination. She felt isolated and found the atmosphere unfriendly.{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|p=576}} She entered [[Maui High School]] one year before Honolulu was [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked by Japan]]. Despite the local Japanese being treated as if they were enemies, Takemoto ran for and won her first election, becoming student body president in her senior year.{{sfn|Fugita|1999|p=246}}{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|p=577}} She was the first girl to serve as president of the student body{{sfn|Mertens|2012|p=46}}{{sfn|Lee|2018}} and graduated as class [[valedictorian]] in 1944.{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|p=578}}\n\n[[File:University of Hawaii Oratorical Contest Winners 1948.png|thumb |alt=Photograph of a group of four young women standing between two young men.|University of Hawaii Oratorical Contest Winners 1948 \u2013 L-R: front, Esther Belarmino, 3rd place; Patsy Takemoto, 1st place; Eichi Oki, finalist; back, Barry Rubin, finalist; Alice Mayo, finalist; and Jean McKillop, 2nd place]]\nTakemoto moved to Honolulu where she attended the University of Hawaii at M\u0101noa with medical school and a career in medicine her ultimate goal. During her sophomore year, she was elected president of the Pre-Medical Students Club and was selected as a member of the varsity debate team. In 1946, she decided to move to the mainland and spent one semester enrolled at [[Wilson College (Pennsylvania)|Wilson College]], a small women's college in [[Chambersburg, Pennsylvania]].{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|p=578}} Unsatisfied with the school, Takemoto transferred to the [[University of Nebraska]]. The university had a long-standing [[racial segregation]] policy whereby students of color lived in different dormitories from the [[white people|white]] students. This angered Takemoto, and she organized and created a coalition of students, parents, administrators, employees, alumni, sponsoring businesses and corporations. She was elected president of the Unaffiliated Students of the University of Nebraska, a \"separate\" student government for non-white students who were prevented from joining fraternities, sororities, and regular dormitories. Takemoto and her coalition successfully lobbied to end the university's segregation policies the same year.{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|p=579}}\n\nAlthough her campaign was successful, in 1947 Takemoto experienced a serious thyroid condition that required surgery and moved back to Honolulu to recover and finish her final year of college at the University of Hawaii.{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|p=580}} In 1948, she earned [[bachelor's degree]]s in [[zoology]] and [[chemistry]] from the university.{{sfn|Fugita|1999|p=246}} She began applying to medical schools, but none of the dozen schools to which she applied would accept her because she was a woman, especially as they were receiving large numbers of applications from returning veterans. She briefly worked as a typist at [[Hickam Air Force Base]] and then went to work at the [[Honolulu Academy of Arts]]. Her supervisor there, Jessie Purdy Restarick, encouraged her to consider a career in law.{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|p=580}}\n\nTakemoto applied to both [[Columbia University]] and the [[University of Chicago Law School]] in the summer of 1948. Columbia rejected her outright, as the term was starting within months.{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|p=580}} The University of Chicago admitted her as a foreign student{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|p=581}} and there was only one other woman in her class. Although she had a difficult time adjusting to the harsh winters,{{sfn|Mertens|2012|p=46}} and she found her courses tedious, Takemoto became a popular figure at the International House.{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|p=581}} While playing [[Contract bridge|bridge]] there one evening, she met John Francis Mink, a former [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] navigator and [[World War II]] veteran,{{sfn|Borreca|2005|p=C5}} who was enrolled in geology classes.{{sfn|Mertens|2012|p=48}} Against her parents' wishes, she and Mink married in January 1951, six months after meeting.{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|p=582}} That spring, she obtained her [[Juris Doctor]] degree{{sfn|Fugita|1999|p=246}}{{sfn|Leavitt|1985|p=183}} and John graduated as well, with a master's degree in geology.{{sfn|Mertens|2012|p=48}}\n\n== Family and early career ==\n===Law===\nUnable to find work as a married, female, Asian-American attorney, Mink returned to her student job at the University of Chicago Law School library while her husband found work immediately with the [[U.S. Steel|United States Steel Corporation]]. In 1952, she gave birth to daughter Gwendolyn (Wendy),{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|p=582}} who later became an educator and prominent author on law, poverty, and women's issues.{{sfn|Mertens|2012|p=46}} In August the family decided to move to Hawaii where John found work with the [[Hawaiian Sugar Planters' Association]].{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|p=582}} To practice law, Mink needed to pass her bar examination, but when she applied her residency was questioned.{{#tag:ref|The [[Cable Act]] of 1922 had repealed the federal statue which required a woman to give up her citizenship in favor of her husband's,{{sfn|Hacker|2014|pp=57-58}} if her husband was a citizen or eligible to be naturalized.{{sfn|Hacker|2014|p=59}} Amendments to the Cable Act continued until 1940 before married women were granted their own status as citizens without restriction.{{sfn|Hacker|2014|pp=60-61}} However, until the 1960s, legislative variations among the states, led to extremely different civil rights for women within the federal system depending upon their residency.{{sfn|Carlson|2007|p=262}}|group=\"Notes\"}}{{sfn|Fugita|1999|p=246}}{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|pp=582\u2013583}}  The territorial law, in force at the time regarding married women, had removed her Hawaiian residency, making her a resident of her husband's state.{{sfn|Fugita|1999|p=246}} Proving that she had never resided in her husband's home state of Pennsylvania, she challenged the territorial law as [[sexist]].{{sfn|Fugita|1999|p=246}}{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|pp=582\u2013583}} [[Attorney General of Hawaii|Hawaii's attorney general]] ruled in her favor and allowed her to take the examination as a Hawaiian resident.{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|p=583}} Passing the test, Mink became \"the first Japanese-American woman licensed to practice law in Hawaii\".{{sfn|Gootman|2002}}\n\n[[File:Young Democratic Club of Hawaii 1954.png|thumb|alt=Photograph of a young woman looking at a paper, surrounded by four men.|Young Democratic Club of Hawaii 1954: \u2013 L-R: seated Representative O.

Believing that under the [[Freedom of Information Act]] agency reports connected to the test should be released, she led 32 congress members in the attempt to secure the reports. The District Court ruled that the documents \"were exempt from compelled disclosure\" and the test was performed in November 1971. The [[United States courts of appeals|Court of Appeals]] reversed the decision of the lower court ruling that an ''[[in camera]]'' inspection of sensitive documents might determine that some could be released. Escalated to the Supreme Court, the decision issued reversed the appeals deicision and confirmed that court inspection could not override the executive's exemption. The Court did allow that Congress could change the law with regard to the regulation of executive actions. In 1974, Congress authorized private scrutiny of documents withheld by the executive. President [[Gerald Ford]] vetoed the legislation, but his veto was overridden by Congress.{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|pp=588\u2013589}}\n\nFrustrated by the roll-backs by the Nixon administration of civil liberties and the continuance of the Vietnam War, Mink entered the presidential race in 1971 hoping to become the Democratic Party's nominee.{{sfn|Fugita|1999|p=248}}{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|p=590}} She was the first Asian-American woman to run for president.{{sfn|Ettinger|McDowell|2020}} As Hawaii had no primary, her name appeared on the Oregon ballot for 1972,{{sfn|Fugita|1999|p=248}}{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|p=590}} as an anti-war candidate.{{sfn|Kua|2002}} During her campaign, she flew to Paris with [[Bella Abzug]], U.S. Representative of New York, to press for the resumption of [[Paris Peace Accords|peace talks]]. Arriving in April, the women met with [[Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb B\u00ecnh]], foreign minister for [[North Vietnam]], as well as representatives for the [[South Vietnam|South Vietnamese]] and United States governments.{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|p=590}} Her actions drew strong criticism, fostering a campaign by Democrats in her home state to oppose her next term in Congress.{{sfn|Fugita|1999|p=248}} In May, she lost the presidential primary, failing to secure enough delegates to support her candidacy, earning only 2% of the 50 potential delegates.{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|p=590}}{{sfn|Walsh|1972|p=1}} [[File:Patsy Mink 1970s.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photographic portrait of a smiling Asian woman in a sleeveless blouse|1972 campaign poster image from the Patsy Mink for President Committee]]\n\nMink co-authored and advocated for the passage of [[Title IX Amendment of the Higher Education Act]], prohibiting gender discrimination by federally funded institutions of higher education.

The law opened employment and education opportunities for women and opposed gender stereotypes in curricula and textbooks.{{sfn|Mertens|2012|p=48}} In addition to her work on education issues, Mink promoted numerous laws that dealt with other issues important to women. These included the [[Consumer Product Safety Act|Consumer Product Safety]] and Equal Employment Opportunity Acts of 1972; the [[Equal Credit Opportunity Act]] of 1974;{{sfn|McAleer|Femia|Brooks|2007|p=7}} and various bills dealing with discrimination in insurance practices, pensions, retirement benefits, social security, survivor's benefits and taxation; equitable jury service; health care issues; housing discrimination based on marital status; and privacy issues. In 1973, she authored and introduced the Equal Rights for Women Act (H.R. 4034), which never made it out of committee, and she supported the ratification of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]].{{sfn|McAleer|Femia|Brooks|2007|p=7}}{{sfn|U.S. Congress|2002}} \n\nIn 1975, Mink attended the [[World Conference on Women, 1975|World Conference on Women]] held in [[Mexico City]] from mid-June to early July.{{sfn|McAleer|Femia|Brooks|2007|p=7}} Together with Abzug and Representative [[Margaret Heckler]] of Massachusetts, she pledged to sponsor and support legislation for a U.S. women's conference for the [[United States Bicentennial]].{{sfn|''The Charlotte News''|1975|p=5A}} When they returned home, Abzug introduced HR 9924, co-sponsored by Mink and others, which granted $5 million in total tax-payer contributions (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|US|5000000|1975|r=1}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars) for both state and [[National Women's Conference]]s.

The Amendment proposed allowing schools to determine whether they would provide equal funding for men's and women's sporting activities. The exemption was struck from the Senate version of the appropriations bill. In the House, though Mink had lobbied heavily against the amendment to the appropriations bill (H.R. 5901), immediately before the vote was called she left the chamber, having received an emergency message that her daughter had been in a serious car accident in New York. In a 211 against and 212 for vote, the appropriation bill passed with the Casey Amendment intact. Upon her return from New York, Speaker [[Carl Albert]] of Oklahoma and other members of the House called for a revote due to the circumstances. July 17 members revoted and with 215 in favor to 178 against, the Casey Amendment was rejected; so protecting the anti-discrimination provisions of Title IX.{{sfn|Office of the Historian|Clerk of the House|2003}}{{sfn|''The Lansing State Journal''|1975|p=C3}}\n\nThroughout her tenure, Mink was involved in many congressional activities, including serving as vice-chair of the Democratic Study Group from 1966 through 1971.

Mink was a third generation [[Japanese American]], having been born and raised on the island of [[Maui]]. After graduating as [[valedictorian]] of the [[Maui High School]] class in 1944, she attended the [[University of Hawaii at M\u0101noa]] for two years and subsequently enrolled at the [[University of Nebraska]], where she experienced racism and worked to have [[Racial segregation|segregation]] [[Separate but equal|policies]] eliminated. After illness forced her to return to Hawaii to complete her studies there, she applied to 12 medical schools to continue her education, but was rejected by all of them. Following a suggestion by her employer, she opted to study law and was accepted at the [[University of Chicago Law School]] in 1948. While at university, she met and married [[World War II]] veteran and former [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] navigator John Francis Mink. When they graduated in 1951, Mink was unable to find employment as a married, Asian woman and after the birth of her daughter in 1952, the couple moved to Hawaii.\n\nWhen she was refused the right to take the bar examination, due to the loss of her Hawaiian residency upon marriage, Mink challenged the [[sexist]] statute. Though she won the right to take the test and passed the examination, no public or private firm would hire her because she was married and had a child. Mink's father helped her open her own practice in 1953 and around the same time she became a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. Hoping to work legislatively to change discriminatory customs through law, she worked as an attorney for the Hawaiian territorial legislature in 1955. The following year, she ran for a seat in the territorial [[Hawaii House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. Winning the race, she became the first Japanese-American woman to serve in the territorial House and two years later, the first woman to serve in the territorial [[Hawaii Senate|Senate]], when she won her campaign for the higher house. In 1960, Mink gained national attention when she spoke in favor of the [[Civil rights movement|civil rights platform]] at the [[Democratic National Convention]] in Los Angeles.\n\nIn 1964, Mink ran for federal office and won a seat in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]]. She was the first [[Person of color|woman of color]] and the first [[Asian American|Asian-American]] woman elected to Congress, and also the first woman elected to Congress from the state of [[Hawaii]]. She served a total of 12 terms, representing Hawaii's [[Hawaii's at-large congressional district|at-large]] and [[Second Congressional District of Hawaii|second]] congressional districts. While in Congress in the late 1960s, she introduced the first comprehensive initiatives under the [[Early Childhood Education Act]], which included the first federal child-care bill and worked on the [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act]] of 1965. In 1970, she became the first person to oppose a [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] nominee on the basis of discrimination against women. Mink initiated a lawsuit which led to significant changes to presidential authority under the [[Freedom of Information Act]] in 1971. In 1972, she co-authored the [[Title IX|Title IX Amendment of the Higher Education Act]], later renamed the Patsy T. Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act in 2002. \n\nMink was the first Asian-American woman to seek the presidential nomination of the Democratic Party. She ran in the [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 election]], standing in the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1972|Oregon primary]] as an anti-war candidate. She was [[Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs|Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs]] from 1977 to 1979. From 1980 to 1982, Mink served as the president of [[Americans for Democratic Action]] and then returned to Honolulu, where she was elected to the [[Honolulu City Council]], which she chaired until 1985. In 1990, she was again elected to the U.S. House, serving until her death in 2002. During her second six terms of office, she continued to work on legislation of importance to women, children, immigrants and minorities.\n\n== Family background ==\nPatsy Matsu Takemoto was born on December 6, 1927 at the sugar plantation camp, [[Hamakuapoko, Hawaii|H\u0101m\u0101kua Poko]], near [[Paia, Hawaii|Paia]], on the island of [[Maui]].{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|p=572}}{{sfn|Fugita|1999|p=246}} Her parents were second-generation Japanese Americans{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|p=573}} or ''[[Nisei]]''. She was a ''[[Sansei]]'', or third-generation descendant of Japanese emigrants.{{sfn|Nomura|1998|pp=288, 290}} Her mother, Mitama Tateyama, was a [[homemaker]],{{sfn|Fugita|1999|p=246}}{{sfn|Leavitt|1985|p=183}} and the daughter of Gojiro Tateyama and Tsuru Wakashige.{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|p=574}}{{sfn|FamilySearch|1905}} Their family, which had 11 children, lived in a [[shack]] by the Waikamoi Stream. William Pogue, Gojiro's employer, arranged to have Tateyama's daughters educated at the Maunaolu Seminary, a [[boarding school]] for [[Christians|Christian]] girls located in the town of [[Makawao, Hawaii|Makawao]].{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|p=574}}\n\nTakemoto's maternal grandparents were both born in the [[Empire of Japan]] during the 19th century.{{sfn|FamilySearch|1933}} Gojiro Tateyama arrived in the [[Territory of Hawaii]] late in the century, and was employed on a [[sugarcane]] [[Sugar plantations in Hawaii|plantation]]. He later moved to Maui, where he was initially employed as a worker for the [[East Maui Irrigation Company]]. Subsequently, he was employed as a [[store manager]] and [[filling station]] employee. He also delivered mail throughout the [[backcountry]] of Maui.{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|p=574}}\n\nHer father, Suematsu Takemoto, was a [[civil engineer]].{{sfn|Fugita|1999|p=246}}{{sfn|Leavitt|1985|p=183}} He graduated from the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]] in 1922, the first Japanese American to graduate from the University of Hawaii with a degree in civil engineering. For several years, he was the only Japanese-American civil engineer working at the sugar plantation in Maui.{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|p=573}} Suematsu was passed over for promotion to chief engineer several times during his career, the positions instead being offered to mostly [[white American]]s. He resigned his local position in 1945 in the aftermath of [[World War II]], and moved to [[Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu]] with his family, where he established his own [[Surveying|land surveying company]].{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|p=574}}\n\n== Early years and education ==\nTakemoto began her education at the H\u0101m\u0101kua Poko Grammar School when she was four and then transferred in 4th grade to the Kaunoa English Standard School{{sfn|Fugita|1999|p=246}} a mostly-white school attended only by students who could speak English and pass the entrance examination. She felt isolated and found the atmosphere unfriendly.{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|p=576}} She entered [[Maui High School]] one year before Honolulu was [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked by Japan]]. Despite the local Japanese being treated as if they were enemies, Takemoto ran for and won her first election, becoming student body president in her senior year.{{sfn|Fugita|1999|p=246}}{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|p=577}} She was the first girl to serve as president of the student body{{sfn|Mertens|2012|p=46}}{{sfn|Lee|2018}} and graduated as class [[valedictorian]] in 1944.{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|p=578}}\n\n[[File:University of Hawaii Oratorical Contest Winners 1948.png|thumb |alt=Photograph of a group of four young women standing between two young men.|University of Hawaii Oratorical Contest Winners 1948 \u2013 L-R: front, Esther Belarmino, 3rd place; Patsy Takemoto, 1st place; Eichi Oki, finalist; back, Barry Rubin, finalist; Alice Mayo, finalist; and Jean McKillop, 2nd place]]\nTakemoto moved to Honolulu where she attended the University of Hawaii at M\u0101noa with medical school and a career in medicine her ultimate goal. During her sophomore year, she was elected president of the Pre-Medical Students Club and was selected as a member of the varsity debate team. In 1946, she decided to move to the mainland and spent one semester enrolled at [[Wilson College (Pennsylvania)|Wilson College]], a small women's college in [[Chambersburg, Pennsylvania]].{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|p=578}} Unsatisfied with the school, Takemoto transferred to the [[University of Nebraska]]. The university had a long-standing [[racial segregation]] policy whereby students of color lived in different dormitories from the [[white people|white]] students. This angered Takemoto, and she organized and created a coalition of students, parents, administrators, employees, alumni, sponsoring businesses and corporations. She was elected president of the Unaffiliated Students of the University of Nebraska, a \"separate\" student government for non-white students who were prevented from joining fraternities, sororities, and regular dormitories. Takemoto and her coalition successfully lobbied to end the university's segregation policies the same year.{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|p=579}}\n\nAlthough her campaign was successful, in 1947 Takemoto experienced a serious thyroid condition that required surgery and moved back to Honolulu to recover and finish her final year of college at the University of Hawaii.{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|p=580}} In 1948, she earned [[bachelor's degree]]s in [[zoology]] and [[chemistry]] from the university.{{sfn|Fugita|1999|p=246}} She began applying to medical schools, but none of the dozen schools to which she applied would accept her because she was a woman, especially as they were receiving large numbers of applications from returning veterans. She briefly worked as a typist at [[Hickam Air Force Base]] and then went to work at the [[Honolulu Academy of Arts]]. Her supervisor there, Jessie Purdy Restarick, encouraged her to consider a career in law.{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|p=580}}\n\nTakemoto applied to both [[Columbia University]] and the [[University of Chicago Law School]] in the summer of 1948. Columbia rejected her outright, as the term was starting within months.{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|p=580}} The University of Chicago admitted her as a foreign student{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|p=581}} and there was only one other woman in her class. Although she had a difficult time adjusting to the harsh winters,{{sfn|Mertens|2012|p=46}} and she found her courses tedious, Takemoto became a popular figure at the International House.{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|p=581}} While playing [[Contract bridge|bridge]] there one evening, she met John Francis Mink, a former [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] navigator and [[World War II]] veteran,{{sfn|Borreca|2005|p=C5}} who was enrolled in geology classes.{{sfn|Mertens|2012|p=48}} Against her parents' wishes, she and Mink married in January 1951, six months after meeting.{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|p=582}} That spring, she obtained her [[Juris Doctor]] degree{{sfn|Fugita|1999|p=246}}{{sfn|Leavitt|1985|p=183}} and John graduated as well, with a master's degree in geology.{{sfn|Mertens|2012|p=48}}\n\n== Family and early career ==\n===Law===\nUnable to find work as a married, female, Asian-American attorney, Mink returned to her student job at the University of Chicago Law School library while her husband found work immediately with the [[U.S. Steel|United States Steel Corporation]]. In 1952, she gave birth to daughter Gwendolyn (Wendy),{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|p=582}} who later became an educator and prominent author on law, poverty, and women's issues.{{sfn|Mertens|2012|p=46}} In August the family decided to move to Hawaii where John found work with the [[Hawaiian Sugar Planters' Association]].{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|p=582}} To practice law, Mink needed to pass her bar examination, but when she applied her residency was questioned.{{#tag:ref|The [[Cable Act]] of 1922 had repealed the federal statue which required a woman to give up her citizenship in favor of her husband's,{{sfn|Hacker|2014|pp=57-58}} if her husband was a citizen or eligible to be naturalized.{{sfn|Hacker|2014|p=59}} Amendments to the Cable Act continued until 1940 before married women were granted their own status as citizens without restriction.{{sfn|Hacker|2014|pp=60-61}} However, until the 1960s, legislative variations among the states, led to extremely different civil rights for women within the federal system depending upon their residency.{{sfn|Carlson|2007|p=262}}|group=\"Notes\"}}{{sfn|Fugita|1999|p=246}}{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|pp=582\u2013583}}  The territorial law, in force at the time regarding married women, had removed her Hawaiian residency, making her a resident of her husband's state.{{sfn|Fugita|1999|p=246}} Proving that she had never resided in her husband's home state of Pennsylvania, she challenged the territorial law as [[sexist]].{{sfn|Fugita|1999|p=246}}{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|pp=582\u2013583}} [[Attorney General of Hawaii|Hawaii's attorney general]] ruled in her favor and allowed her to take the examination as a Hawaiian resident.{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|p=583}} Passing the test, Mink became \"the first Japanese-American woman licensed to practice law in Hawaii\".{{sfn|Gootman|2002}}\n\n[[File:Young Democratic Club of Hawaii 1954.png|thumb|alt=Photograph of a young woman looking at a paper, surrounded by four men.|Young Democratic Club of Hawaii 1954: \u2013 L-R: seated Representative O.

She was elected \"chairman of the territory-wide Young Democrats\", which according to Esther K. Arinaga and Renee E. Ojiri was \"a group that would wield a remarkable influence over Hawaiian politics for several decades\".{{sfn|Arinaga|Ojiri|2003|p=583}}\n\n===State and territorial politics===\nIn 1954, Mink worked to help elect [[John A.
