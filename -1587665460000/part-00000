ABC dropped the show on July 6, 1973, but it continued in [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] for another year (1973\u20131974) as ''The New Dating Game''. The program was revived three additional times in syndication afterwards. The first revival premiered in 1978 and ran until 1980, the second ran from 1986 until 1989, and the last ran from 1996 until 1999 with a season of reruns following.\n\n[[Jim Lange]] hosted ''The Dating Game'' for its entire ABC network run and the 1973 and 1978 syndicated editions. The 1986 revival was hosted by [[Elaine Joyce]] for its first season and Jeff MacGregor for its remaining two seasons. When the show was revived with a different format in 1996, [[Brad Sherwood]] was named as its host. [[Chuck Woolery]] took over in 1997 after he left ''[[The Home and Family Show]]'' when the original format was reinstated and hosted for the last two seasons.\n\nBeginning in 1966, ''The Dating Game'' was often paired with ''[[The Newlywed Game]]''. This was especially true when the two shows entered syndication; in fact, in 1996 the revivals of both ''The Dating Game'' and ''The Newlywed Game'' were sold as a package called \"The Dating-Newlywed Hour\".\n\nThe program was originally broadcast in black-and-white, but when a prime-time version began in October 1966, both it and the daytime version were broadcast in color; the daytime version thus became the first ABC daytime series to be broadcast in color on a regular basis.\n\n==Format==\nTypically, a [[bachelorette]] would question three [[bachelor]]s, who were hidden from her view; at the end of the questioning period, she would choose one to go out with on a date paid for by the show. Occasionally, the roles would be reversed with a man questioning three ladies; other times, a celebrity would question three players for a date for themselves or for a co-worker or a relative of theirs.\n\nBefore becoming famous, [[Farrah Fawcett]], [[Suzanne Somers]], [[Yvonne Craig]], [[Lindsay Wagner]], [[Leif Garrett]], [[Tom Selleck]] and [[Lee Majors]] appeared as contestants on the show in the 1960s and early 1970s. Other contestants who appeared before becoming famous included [[The Carpenters]], [[Jackson Bostwick]], [[Michael Richards]], [[Joanna Cameron]], [[Andy Kaufman]] (who went under the [[pseudonym]] Baji Kimran), [[Steve Martin]], [[Burt Reynolds]], [[John Ritter]], [[Phil Hartman]], [[Jennifer Granholm]] (Governor of Michigan from 2003\u20132010), [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], and [[Alex Kozinski]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/law/fed-soc/images/datinggame.rm.ram |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-07-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060104214318/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/law/fed-soc/images/datinggame.rm.ram |archivedate=January 4, 2006 |df=mdy-all }} Columbia Law</ref> Serial killer [[Rodney Alcala]]'s episodes were shown during his murder spree and after he had been convicted of assault in California.\n\nSome contestants appeared even after they were fairly well known, including a young [[Michael Jackson]], [[Dusty Springfield]], [[Ron Howard]], [[Maureen McCormick]], [[Barry Williams (actor)|Barry Williams]], [[Sally Field]], [[Richard Dawson]], [[Jay North]], and [[Paul Lynde]].\n\nOne standard trademark was that at the end of each episode, the host and winning contestants would blow a kiss to the viewers.\n\n==Game play==\n\n===Original version===\n[[File:The Dating Game Pat Paulsen 1968.JPG|thumb|150px|Comedian [[Pat Paulsen]] makes a guest appearance in 1968.]]\nGenerally the bachelorette would ask questions written in advance on cards to each of the three hidden bachelors. The same question could be asked to multiple bachelors. This continued until time ran out. The bachelorette would make her choice based solely on the answers to her questions. Occasionally, the contestant was a bachelor who would ask questions to three bachelorettes. Certain kinds of questions were \"off-limits\", such as name, age, occupation, and income.\n\nWhen the original format returned to the syndicated revival in 1997, these rules were readopted but there was more of a variety between bachelors and bachelorettes.\n\n===1996\u201397 season===\nFor the first season of the 1996 revival, ''The Dating Game'' used a different format. A notable change was that the prospective bachelor/bachelorette knew what the first names of his or her potential dates were at all times.\n\nInstead of asking questions of their potential date, the bachelor/bachelorette was presented with two pun-laden statements, each pertaining to one of the potential dates. When chosen, a new statement replaced the old statement and the potential date explained the reason why that fact pertained to them. Play continued until time expired, after which the bachelor/bachelorette gave their choice.\n\nIn several weeks of episodes that aired at various times throughout the season, another format was used. This format saw the players choose a potential date based on how good they looked and another based on personality. To determine the \"looks\" portion, the bachelor/bachelorette observed their potential dates (another change not seen on any ''Dating Game'' series beforehand) for several seconds; the three players wore noise-cancelling headphones so they could not hear what the bachelor/bachelorette was saying about them and they identified by numbers. The statement round was used to determine the \"personality\" portion. After the game ended the bachelor/bachelorette chose one panelist based on looks and one based on personality, then was prompted to choose either of the two. In the case the bachelor/bachelorette chose the same person for both looks and personality, they won a cash prize of $500.\n\n==Episode status==\nVarious episodes from the ABC daytime run have been aired on GSN in the past.\n\nThe remaining versions of the show, which were made for ABC prime-time and for syndication, are assumed to exist in their entirety.\n\nAfter the syndicated finale in 1980, repeats of the 1978\u20131980 version were seen on KHJ-TV (now [[KCAL-TV]]) in [[Los Angeles]] from September 26, 1983 to September 12, 1986, as well as some other cities.  In another variation of the final year in reruns, there were some episodes from ABC daytime, ABC primetime and syndicated weekly.\n\n==Guests==\nSome of the celebrities that appeared on ''The Dating Game'' appeared as a bachelor or bachelorette before becoming famous or as a special guest star include:\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Willie Aames]] (1978)\n*[[Rodney Alcala]], subsequently dubbed \"The Dating Game Killer\" (1978)<ref>{{cite news |author=David Gardner |date=April 1, 2010 |title=The 'most prolific' serial killer in U.S. history is sentenced to death as police fear he could be behind 130 murders |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1262485/Rodney-Alcala-sentenced-death-murders-women-girl-12.html |journal=Mail Online |accessdate=October 11, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/100-victims-of-serial-killer-rodney-211901 |title='100 victims' of serial killer Rodney Alcala |journal=Times Mirror |date= August 11, 2009 |accessdate=October 11, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |journal=National Public Radio blogs |url= https://www.npr.org/blogs/talk/2010/03/serial_killer_rodney_alcalas_p.html |title=Serial Killer Rodney Alcalas}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Rudegeair, Peter |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/07/us-usa-crime-serialkiller-idUSBRE9060S020130107 |date=January 7, 2013 |title=\"Dating Game\" killer sentenced for 1970s murders |journal=Reuters archive |accessdate=October 11, 2013}}</ref>\n*[[Wally Amos|Famous Amos]] (1978)\n*[[Judd Apatow]] (1980s)\n*[[Desi Arnaz Jr.]] (1967)\n*Mary Arnold of [[Kenny Rogers and The First Edition]] (1972)\n*[[Candice Bergen]] (1973)\n*[[Jacqueline Bisset]] (1973)\n*[[Bill Bixby]] (1968)\n*[[Karen Black]] (1973)\n*[[Danny Bonaduce]] (1972)\n*[[Jackson Bostwick]] (1968)\n*[[Julie Budd]] (1973)\n*[[Joanna Cameron]] (Late 1960s)\n*[[The Carpenters|Karen and Richard Carpenter]] (1970)\n*[[Angela Cartwright]] (1970)\n*[[David Cassidy]] (1970)\n*[[Barrie Chase]] (1966)\n*[[Dick Clark]] (1973)\n*[[Jeremy Clyde]] (1966)\n*[[Ronald K.L.

ABC dropped the show on July 6, 1973, but it continued in [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] for another year (1973\u20131974) as ''The New Dating Game''. The program was revived three additional times in syndication afterwards. The first revival premiered in 1978 and ran until 1980, the second ran from 1986 until 1989, and the last ran from 1996 until 1999 with a season of reruns following.\n\n[[Jim Lange]] hosted ''The Dating Game'' for its entire ABC network run and the 1973 and 1978 syndicated editions. The 1986 revival was hosted by [[Elaine Joyce]] for its first season and Jeff MacGregor for its remaining two seasons. When the show was revived with a different format in 1996, [[Brad Sherwood]] was named as its host. [[Chuck Woolery]] took over in 1997 after he left ''[[The Home and Family Show]]'' when the original format was reinstated and hosted for the last two seasons.\n\nBeginning in 1966, ''The Dating Game'' was often paired with ''[[The Newlywed Game]]''. This was especially true when the two shows entered syndication; in fact, in 1996 the revivals of both ''The Dating Game'' and ''The Newlywed Game'' were sold as a package called \"The Dating-Newlywed Hour\".\n\nThe program was originally broadcast in black-and-white, but when a prime-time version began in October 1966, both it and the daytime version were broadcast in color; the daytime version thus became the first ABC daytime series to be broadcast in color on a regular basis.\n\n==Format==\nTypically, a [[bachelorette]] would question three [[bachelor]]s, who were hidden from her view; at the end of the questioning period, she would choose one to go out with on a date paid for by the show. Occasionally, the roles would be reversed with a man questioning three ladies; other times, a celebrity would question three players for a date for themselves or for a co-worker or a relative of theirs.\n\nBefore becoming famous, [[Farrah Fawcett]], [[Suzanne Somers]], [[Yvonne Craig]], [[Lindsay Wagner]], [[Leif Garrett]], [[Tom Selleck]] and [[Lee Majors]] appeared as contestants on the show in the 1960s and early 1970s. Other contestants who appeared before becoming famous included [[The Carpenters]], [[Jackson Bostwick]], [[Michael Richards]], [[Joanna Cameron]], [[Andy Kaufman]] (who went under the [[pseudonym]] Baji Kimran), [[Steve Martin]], [[Burt Reynolds]], [[John Ritter]], [[Phil Hartman]], [[Jennifer Granholm]] (Governor of Michigan from 2003\u20132010), [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], and [[Alex Kozinski]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/law/fed-soc/images/datinggame.rm.ram |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-07-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060104214318/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/law/fed-soc/images/datinggame.rm.ram |archivedate=January 4, 2006 |df=mdy-all }} Columbia Law</ref> Serial killer [[Rodney Alcala]]'s episodes were shown during his murder spree and after he had been convicted of assault in California.\n\nSome contestants appeared even after they were fairly well known, including a young [[Michael Jackson]], [[Dusty Springfield]], [[Ron Howard]], [[Maureen McCormick]], [[Barry Williams (actor)|Barry Williams]], [[Sally Field]], [[Richard Dawson]], [[Jay North]], and [[Paul Lynde]].\n\nOne standard trademark was that at the end of each episode, the host and winning contestants would blow a kiss to the viewers.\n\n==Game play==\n\n===Original version===\n[[File:The Dating Game Pat Paulsen 1968.JPG|thumb|150px|Comedian [[Pat Paulsen]] makes a guest appearance in 1968.]]\nGenerally the bachelorette would ask questions written in advance on cards to each of the three hidden bachelors. The same question could be asked to multiple bachelors. This continued until time ran out. The bachelorette would make her choice based solely on the answers to her questions. Occasionally, the contestant was a bachelor who would ask questions to three bachelorettes. Certain kinds of questions were \"off-limits\", such as name, age, occupation, and income.\n\nWhen the original format returned to the syndicated revival in 1997, these rules were readopted but there was more of a variety between bachelors and bachelorettes.\n\n===1996\u201397 season===\nFor the first season of the 1996 revival, ''The Dating Game'' used a different format. A notable change was that the prospective bachelor/bachelorette knew what the first names of his or her potential dates were at all times.\n\nInstead of asking questions of their potential date, the bachelor/bachelorette was presented with two pun-laden statements, each pertaining to one of the potential dates. When chosen, a new statement replaced the old statement and the potential date explained the reason why that fact pertained to them. Play continued until time expired, after which the bachelor/bachelorette gave their choice.\n\nIn several weeks of episodes that aired at various times throughout the season, another format was used. This format saw the players choose a potential date based on how good they looked and another based on personality. To determine the \"looks\" portion, the bachelor/bachelorette observed their potential dates (another change not seen on any ''Dating Game'' series beforehand) for several seconds; the three players wore noise-cancelling headphones so they could not hear what the bachelor/bachelorette was saying about them and they identified by numbers. The statement round was used to determine the \"personality\" portion. After the game ended the bachelor/bachelorette chose one panelist based on looks and one based on personality, then was prompted to choose either of the two. In the case the bachelor/bachelorette chose the same person for both looks and personality, they won a cash prize of $500.\n\n==Episode status==\nVarious episodes from the ABC daytime run have been aired on GSN in the past.\n\nThe remaining versions of the show, which were made for ABC prime-time and for syndication, are assumed to exist in their entirety.\n\nAfter the syndicated finale in 1980, repeats of the 1978\u20131980 version were seen on KHJ-TV (now [[KCAL-TV]]) in [[Los Angeles]] from September 26, 1983 to September 12, 1986, as well as some other cities.  In another variation of the final year in reruns, there were some episodes from ABC daytime, ABC primetime and syndicated weekly.\n\n==Guests==\nSome of the celebrities that appeared on ''The Dating Game'' appeared as a bachelor or bachelorette before becoming famous or as a special guest star include:\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Willie Aames]] (1978)\n*[[Rodney Alcala]], subsequently dubbed \"The Dating Game Killer\" (1978)<ref>{{cite news |author=David Gardner |date=April 1, 2010 |title=The 'most prolific' serial killer in U.S. history is sentenced to death as police fear he could be behind 130 murders |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1262485/Rodney-Alcala-sentenced-death-murders-women-girl-12.html |journal=Mail Online |accessdate=October 11, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/100-victims-of-serial-killer-rodney-211901 |title='100 victims' of serial killer Rodney Alcala |journal=Times Mirror |date= August 11, 2009 |accessdate=October 11, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |journal=National Public Radio blogs |url= https://www.npr.org/blogs/talk/2010/03/serial_killer_rodney_alcalas_p.html |title=Serial Killer Rodney Alcalas}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Rudegeair, Peter |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/07/us-usa-crime-serialkiller-idUSBRE9060S020130107 |date=January 7, 2013 |title=\"Dating Game\" killer sentenced for 1970s murders |journal=Reuters archive |accessdate=October 11, 2013}}</ref>\n*[[Wally Amos|Famous Amos]] (1978)\n*[[Judd Apatow]] (1980s)\n*[[Desi Arnaz Jr.]] (1967)\n*Mary Arnold of [[Kenny Rogers and The First Edition]] (1972)\n*[[Candice Bergen]] (1973)\n*[[Jacqueline Bisset]] (1973)\n*[[Bill Bixby]] (1968)\n*[[Karen Black]] (1973)\n*[[Danny Bonaduce]] (1972)\n*[[Jackson Bostwick]] (1968)\n*[[Julie Budd]] (1973)\n*[[Joanna Cameron]] (Late 1960s)\n*[[The Carpenters|Karen and Richard Carpenter]] (1970)\n*[[Angela Cartwright]] (1970)\n*[[David Cassidy]] (1970)\n*[[Barrie Chase]] (1966)\n*[[Dick Clark]] (1973)\n*[[Jeremy Clyde]] (1966)\n*[[Ronald K.L.

Expansionary fiscal policy is an increase in government spending or a decrease in taxation, while contractionary fiscal policy is a decrease in government spending or an increase in taxes. Expansionary fiscal policy can be used by governments to stimulate the economy during a [[recession]]. For example, an increase in government spending directly increases [[demand]] for goods and services, which can help increase [[Output (economics)|output]] and [[employment]]. On the other hand, contractionary fiscal policy can be used by governments to cool down the economy during an economic boom.

According to [[Keynesian economics]], increased government spending raises [[aggregate demand]] and increases [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]], which leads to increased production and faster recovery from recessions. [[Classical economists]], on the other hand, believe that increased government spending exacerbates an [[recession|economic contraction]] by shifting resources from the private sector, which they consider productive, to the public sector, which they consider unproductive.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Macroeconomics for Today|last=Irvin|first=Tucker|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2012|isbn=9781133435051|edition= 8th |location=Mason, OH|pages=|oclc=830731890}}</ref>\n\nIn [[economics]], the potential \"shifting\" in resources from the [[private sector]] to the [[public sector]] as a result of an increase in government [[deficit spending]] is called [[Crowding out (economics)|crowding out]].<ref name=\":0\" /> The figure to the right depicts the market for capital, otherwise known as the market for [[loanable funds]]. The downward sloping [[demand curve]] D1 represents demand for private capital by [[firm]]s and [[investor]]s, and the upward sloping [[supply curve]] S1 represents savings by private individuals. The initial equilibrium in this market is represented by point A, where the equilibrium quantity of capital is K1 and the equilibrium interest rate is R1. If the government increases [[deficit spending]], it will borrow money from the private [[capital market]] and reduce the supply of savings to S2. The new equilibrium is at point B, where the interest rate has increased to R2 and the quantity of capital available to the private sector has decreased to K1. The government has essentially made borrowing more expensive and has taken away savings from the market, which \"crowds out\" some private investment. The crowding out of private investment could limit the economic growth from the initial increase government spending.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":8\" />\n\n=== Heterodox Economics disagrees ===\nThe above \"explanation\" comes from conventional, neoclassical, neoliberal economics, a \"discipline\" that did not predict the largest economic event of the last 80 years (the Global Financial Crisis, or sub-prime mortgage derivatives meltdown). There is very little empirical evidence that it works at all, so one must take it with a grain, if not a kilogram of salt.\n\nAs Matt Stoller says such economics \u201cis to create a language and methodology for governing that hides political assumptions from the public\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/what-is-the-point-of-economics|title=What Is the Point of Economics?|last=Stoller|first=Matt|website=mattstoller.substack.com|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>\n\nThe elaborate myths it promotes are things like \"crowding out,\" which presumes the economy is a zero-sum game. If that were true, then resources would always be 100% utilized, so if the government employs additional resources, it must do so at the expense of the private sector. But the economy, as of this writing, is only 77% employed, and as the coronavirus epidemic proceeds, that figure is going to be much lower. A sensible economist would conclude that government spending would employ idle resources, not \"crowd out\" private use of those resources.\n\nAnd that is exactly what history demonstrates: GDP growth spikes for the New Deal and that big public works project we call \"World War II,\" because those resources un- or under-employed during the Great Depression were brought back into production.\n\nThe mistaken conclusion is that government competes for savings, too. \"If government tries to borrow more by issuing and selling more bonds, then the competition for finance would push up interest rates. Some private firms would decide not to borrow at the higher rates and hence investment would be lower. Also, durable consuption expenditure by households will decline because some of it is financed by borrowing.\n\n\"However, that model is incorrect. Government fiscal deficits generate non-government surpluses (flows) that accumulate to the non-government sector's net acquisition of financial assets (a stock)... Since there are more savings (as a result of higher income levels arising from the deficits) and greater financial wealth, it is not true that government is competing with private sector borrowers for a limited supply of savings (a flow) to place government bonds into wealth portfolios that are fixed in size. Both savings and portfolios expand as government deficits grow.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mitchell, William, 1952-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/967762036|title=Macroeconomics|others=Wray, L.

Government 'debt' is nothing like household debt, it's like bank debt. If you have a bank account, that is your asset, but to the bank, it's a liability. Reducing the bank's debt reduces the depositors' savings. \n\nAccording to the neoclassicals, there's a threshold for government debt, beyond which the economy suffers, and bond markets demand higher interest rates, or they won't buy the debt. People often point to Greece as an example--but Greece no longer makes its own currency, so it isn't comparable to a monetary sovereign. Economists Reinhart and Rogoff tried to convince economists that government 'debt' larger than 90% of GDP impaired economic performance--until others examined their work found they cherry-picked their examples, and even had a mistake in the spreadsheet formulas they used to calculate this result.\n\nWhat is comparable to the monetary sovereign U.S. situation is Japan's. Japan makes the fiat currency called 'Yen,' and has a floating exchange rate. Its 'debt'-to-GDP ratio is 240%. The neoclassicals would say they certainly have borrowed too much, so the bond markets will charge a risk premium (higher interest rates) before they can sell Yen-denominated bonds.

It is a purchase from the national accounts \"use of income account\" for goods and services directly satisfying of individual needs (''individual consumption'') or collective needs of members of the community (''collective consumption''). GFCE consists of the value of the goods and services produced by the government itself other than own-account [[capital formation]] and sales and of purchases by the government of goods and services produced by market producers that are supplied to households\u2014without any transformation\u2014as \"social transfers\" in kind.<ref>F.

Expansionary fiscal policy is an increase in government spending or a decrease in taxation, while contractionary fiscal policy is a decrease in government spending or an increase in taxes. Expansionary fiscal policy can be used by governments to stimulate the economy during a [[recession]]. For example, an increase in government spending directly increases [[demand]] for goods and services, which can help increase [[Output (economics)|output]] and [[employment]]. On the other hand, contractionary fiscal policy can be used by governments to cool down the economy during an economic boom. A decrease in government spending can help keep [[inflation]] in check.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Principles of Macroeconomics: Economics and the Economy|last=Taylor|first=Timothy|publisher=Textbook Media Press|year=2017|isbn=9780996996334|edition= Fourth |location=Minneapolis|pages=366\u2013340|oclc=1001342630}}</ref> During economic downturns, in the short run, government spending can be changed either via [[Automatic stabilizer|automatic stabilization]] or discretionary stabilization.

According to [[Keynesian economics]], increased government spending raises [[aggregate demand]] and increases [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]], which leads to increased production and faster recovery from recessions. [[Classical economists]], on the other hand, believe that increased government spending exacerbates an [[recession|economic contraction]] by shifting resources from the private sector, which they consider productive, to the public sector, which they consider unproductive.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Macroeconomics for Today|last=Irvin|first=Tucker|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2012|isbn=9781133435051|edition= 8th |location=Mason, OH|pages=|oclc=830731890}}</ref>\n\nIn [[economics]], the potential \"shifting\" in resources from the [[private sector]] to the [[public sector]] as a result of an increase in government [[deficit spending]] is called [[Crowding out (economics)|crowding out]].<ref name=\":0\" /> The figure to the right depicts the market for capital, otherwise known as the market for [[loanable funds]]. The downward sloping [[demand curve]] D1 represents demand for private capital by [[firm]]s and [[investor]]s, and the upward sloping [[supply curve]] S1 represents savings by private individuals. The initial equilibrium in this market is represented by point A, where the equilibrium quantity of capital is K1 and the equilibrium interest rate is R1. If the government increases [[deficit spending]], it will borrow money from the private [[capital market]] and reduce the supply of savings to S2. The new equilibrium is at point B, where the interest rate has increased to R2 and the quantity of capital available to the private sector has decreased to K1. The government has essentially made borrowing more expensive and has taken away savings from the market, which \"crowds out\" some private investment. The crowding out of private investment could limit the economic growth from the initial increase government spending.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":8\" />\n\n=== Heterodox Economics disagrees ===\nThe above \"explanation\" comes from conventional, neoclassical, neoliberal economics, a \"discipline\" that did not predict the largest economic event of the last 80 years (the Global Financial Crisis, or sub-prime mortgage derivatives meltdown). There is very little empirical evidence that it works at all, so one must take it with a grain, if not a kilogram of salt.\n\nAs Matt Stoller says such economics \u201cis to create a language and methodology for governing that hides political assumptions from the public\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/what-is-the-point-of-economics|title=What Is the Point of Economics?|last=Stoller|first=Matt|website=mattstoller.substack.com|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>\n\nThe elaborate myths it promotes are things like \"crowding out,\" which presumes the economy is a zero-sum game. If that were true, then resources would always be 100% utilized, so if the government employs additional resources, it must do so at the expense of the private sector. But the economy, as of this writing, is only 77% employed, and as the coronavirus epidemic proceeds, that figure is going to be much lower. A sensible economist would conclude that government spending would employ idle resources, not \"crowd out\" private use of those resources.\n\nAnd that is exactly what history demonstrates: GDP growth spikes for the New Deal and that big public works project we call \"World War II,\" because those resources un- or under-employed during the Great Depression were brought back into production.\n\nThe mistaken conclusion is that government competes for savings, too. \"If government tries to borrow more by issuing and selling more bonds, then the competition for finance would push up interest rates. Some private firms would decide not to borrow at the higher rates and hence investment would be lower. Also, durable consuption expenditure by households will decline because some of it is financed by borrowing.\n\n\"However, that model is incorrect. Government fiscal deficits generate non-government surpluses (flows) that accumulate to the non-government sector's net acquisition of financial assets (a stock)... Since there are more savings (as a result of higher income levels arising from the deficits) and greater financial wealth, it is not true that government is competing with private sector borrowers for a limited supply of savings (a flow) to place government bonds into wealth portfolios that are fixed in size. Both savings and portfolios expand as government deficits grow.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mitchell, William, 1952-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/967762036|title=Macroeconomics|others=Wray, L.

Government 'debt' is nothing like household debt, it's like bank debt. If you have a bank account, that is your asset, but to the bank, it's a liability. Reducing the bank's debt reduces the depositors' savings. \n\nAccording to the neoclassicals, there's a threshold for government debt, beyond which the economy suffers, and bond markets demand higher interest rates, or they won't buy the debt. People often point to Greece as an example--but Greece no longer makes its own currency, so it isn't comparable to a monetary sovereign. Economists Reinhart and Rogoff tried to convince economists that government 'debt' larger than 90% of GDP impaired economic performance--until others examined their work found they cherry-picked their examples, and even had a mistake in the spreadsheet formulas they used to calculate this result.\n\nWhat is comparable to the monetary sovereign U.S. situation is Japan's. Japan makes the fiat currency called 'Yen,' and has a floating exchange rate. Its 'debt'-to-GDP ratio is 240%. The neoclassicals would say they certainly have borrowed too much, so the bond markets will charge a risk premium (higher interest rates) before they can sell Yen-denominated bonds. The truth is that the Bank of Japan's debt sells at near a zero interest rate. \n\n== Current use: final consumption expenditure ==\n{{Main|Government final consumption expenditure}}\n\nGovernment acquisition of goods and services for current use to directly satisfy individual or collective needs of the members of the community is called government final consumption expenditure (GFCE.) It is a purchase from the national accounts \"use of income account\" for goods and services directly satisfying of individual needs (''individual consumption'') or collective needs of members of the community (''collective consumption''). GFCE consists of the value of the goods and services produced by the government itself other than own-account [[capital formation]] and sales and of purchases by the government of goods and services produced by market producers that are supplied to households\u2014without any transformation\u2014as \"social transfers\" in kind.<ref>F.

His voice attracts the sage musician [[Swami Haridas]] of [[Brindaban]]. He trains the boy in the [[Dhrupad]] style. Swami Haridas gets Tanu to study under [[Muhammad Ghaus]], where he lives with his childhood mate Hansa. Several years pass and Ghaus asks Tanu to shift to the court of Raja Ramchandra. This disappoints Tanu as he has plans to marry Hansa. However, he ventures forth to the palace where his voice is applauded and he is awarded the title of Sangeet Shiromani Tansen. His singing reputation reaches Emperor Akbar, who invites him to join his court singers. There, he becomes one of the nine jewels of the Emperor's exceptionally talented men. The story then follows misunderstandings with his beloved Hansa, his singing prowess and finally his getting united once again with Hansa.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Bharat Bhushan]] as [[Tansen|Sangeet Shiromani / Sangeet Samrat Tansen 'Tanu']]\n* [[Anita Guha]] as Hansa\n* [[Mukri]] as Ustad Fateh Khan\n* [[David (actor)|David Abraham]] as [[Muhammad Ghaus|Mohammed Khauj]] \n* [[Sapru (actor)|D.

Swami Haridas gets Tanu to study under [[Muhammad Ghaus]], where he lives with his childhood mate Hansa. Several years pass and Ghaus asks Tanu to shift to the court of Raja Ramchandra.

His singing reputation reaches Emperor Akbar, who invites him to join his court singers. There, he becomes one of the nine jewels of the Emperor's exceptionally talented men.
