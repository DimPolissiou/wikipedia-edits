She is part of a popular but feared clique that also consists of three other wealthy and beautiful girls with the same first name: Heather Chandler, Heather Duke, and Heather McNamara. She has grown tired of them and longs to return to her old life with her \"nerdy\" friends.\n\nOne day, new student and rebellious outsider Jason \"J.D.\" Dean pulls a gun and fires blanks on jocks Kurt Kelly and Ram Sweeney in response to them bullying him. Veronica observes this and finds herself fascinated. She later attends a frat party with Heather Chandler. After refusing to have sex with a frat brother, and vomiting on Chandler, the latter vows to destroy her reputation. J.D. shows up at Veronica's house, and they end up having sex outside. They express to each other their mutual hatred of Chandler's tyranny. The next morning, Veronica and J.D. break into Chandler's house. J.D. jokingly puts drain cleaner in a mug with the intention of giving it to Chandler but Veronica quickly shuts him down. She mixes orange juice and milk together instead as an attempt to make her throw up and get \nrevenge. However, she gets the cups mixed up. J.D. notices this, and hands Chandler the mug with the drain cleaner. She drinks it, crashes through a glass table, and dies. Veronica panics but J.D. urges her to forge a dramatic suicide note in Chandler's handwriting.\nThe school and community look on Chandler's apparent suicide as a tragic decision made by a troubled teenager, making her more worshipped in death than in life. Duke soon steps into the role of clique leader and begins wearing a red scrunchie that had belonged to Chandler.\n\nMcNamara convinces Veronica to go with her, Kurt and Ram on a double date, during which the boys end up drunk and pass out in cow manure. The following day, they spread a false rumor about Veronica performing oral sex on them, ruining her reputation. J.D. proposes that she lure them into the woods with the promise to \"make the rumors true,\" then shoot them with nonfatal bullets. J.D. shoots and kills Ram but Veronica misses Kurt, who runs away. J.D. chases Kurt back towards Veronica, who fatally shoots him. J.D. plants material next to the boys implying that they were gay, and a note stating the two were lovers participating in a suicide pact. Veronica then realises the bullets were real. At their funeral, the boys are made into martyrs against homophobia. Although she keeps dating J.D., Veronica is increasingly disturbed by his behavior. Martha Dunnstock, an obese student, pins a suicide note to her chest and walks into traffic. She survives but is badly injured, and she is mocked for trying to \"act like the popular kids.\" McNamara calls a radio show one night while Veronica and Duke are listening and talks of depression in her life; the next day, Duke tells the entire school about the radio call. McNamara attempts to take her life by overdosing in the girls' bathroom but she is saved by Veronica. She tells J.D. that she will not participate in any more killings.\n\nJ.D. blackmails Duke into getting everyone to sign a petition that unbeknownst to her is intended to act as a mass suicide note. Veronica has a nightmare where J.D. kills Duke, and she sees the undead Chandler at the funeral. She wakes up and writes what appears a suicide note in her diary, then stages a hanging (actually tying a harness around her waist to support her weight) for J.D. to see as he climbs into her room with a revolver. Assuming she is dead, J.D. rambles about his intent to kill her, had she not committed suicide, and his plan to blow up the school during a pep rally. Veronica reveals to her mother that she is not dead, and at school the next day, she confronts J.D. in the boiler room while he is planting dynamite. She shoots him when he refuses to stop the bombing. As J.D. collapses, his switchblade cuts the wires to the detonator, and it stops. Veronica walks out through the pep rally while everyone is cheering. The severely injured J.D. follows her outside with a bomb strapped to his chest, offers a personal eulogy, and detonates the bomb. She confronts Duke, takes the red scrunchie, and vows to change the way things are. She then invites Martha Dunnstock to hang out on prom night and watch movies with her. Martha and Veronica head down the hallway while Duke watches.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Winona Ryder]] as Veronica Sawyer\n* [[Christian Slater]] as Jason \"J.D.\" Dean\n* [[Shannen Doherty]] as Heather Duke\n* [[Lisanne Falk]] as Heather McNamara\n* [[Kim Walker (actress)|Kim Walker]] as Heather Chandler\n* [[Penelope Milford]] as Pauline Fleming\n* [[Glenn Shadix]] as Father Ripper\n* Lance Fenton as Kurt Kelly\n* [[Patrick Labyorteaux]] as Ram Sweeney\n* Jeremy Applegate as Peter Dawson\n* Em Lodge as M.C.

(The cafeteria scene near the start of ''Heathers'' was written as an homage to the barracks scene which opens Kubrick's ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]''.) After a number of failed attempts to get the script to Kubrick, Waters approached director [[Michael Lehmann]], who agreed to helm the film with producer [[Denise Di Novi]].\n\nIn the original version of the script, J.D. successfully blows up Westerburg High, and the final scene features a surreal prom gathering of all the students in heaven. Executives at [[New World Pictures]] agreed to finance the film, but they disliked the dark ending and insisted that it be changed.<ref name=\"Markovitz\">{{cite magazine| url=https://ew.com/article/2014/04/04/heathers-oral-history/| title=Heathers: An Oral History| author=Adam Markovitz| magazine=Entertainment Weekly| date=2014-04-04| access-date=2018-01-10}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nMany actors and actresses turned down the project because of its dark subject matter.

Seventeen-year-old [[Shannen Doherty]] wanted the role of Veronica, but Ryder had been cast, so the producers asked her to audition for Heather Chandler. Doherty was more interested in playing Heather Duke, and ended up giving an \"amazing\" reading as Duke which secured her the part. The producers wanted her to dye her hair blonde to match the other \"Heathers\", which Doherty refused, so they compromised on her having red hair.<ref name=oral/>\n\n===Filming===\nPrincipal photography took place over 33 days in July and August 1988, on a budget of $3 million.<ref name=\"Markovitz\"/> Although set in Ohio, filming was done entirely in Los Angeles. \"Westerburg High School\" is an amalgam of [[Corvallis High School (California)|Corvallis High School]] (now [[Bridges Academy]]) in Studio City, [[Verdugo Hills High School]] in Tujunga, and [[Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District|John Adams Middle School]] in Santa Monica.<ref name=\"Film locations for 'Heathers'\">{{cite web| url=http://movie-locations.com/movies/h/heathers.html#.WozGQHtFzIU| title=Film locations for 'Heathers'| website=movie-locations.com| access-date=2018-02-20}}</ref> The auditorium scenes were shot at Verdugo Hills High, and the climactic scene on the stairs was filmed outside John Adams Middle School.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.fast-rewind.com/locations_heathers.htm| title=Heathers Movie Filming Locations| website=fast-rewind.com| access-date=2018-02-20}}</ref> The funeral scenes were filmed at Church of the Angels in Pasadena, California, a location used in other media including ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' and ''[[Just Married]]''.<ref name=\"Film locations for 'Heathers'\"/>\n\nMichael Lehmann has called Doherty \"a bit of a handful\" on set, in part because she objected to the swearing in the script and refused to say some of the more explicit lines.<ref name=\"Markovitz\"/> Falk stated that Doherty \"didn't have much of a sense of humour, and she took herself a little seriously\", and Di Novi said: \"I don't think Shannen really got what ''Heathers'' was.

According to Clare Connors' scathing rebuke, ''Heathers'' reveals that conflict as arising within the heart of the American high school: {{quote|On one hand, the high school serves as an icon of American democracy and longing for social justice and equality, one place in American life where every young citizen can access equal opportunity and upward mobility. On the other hand, the cultural life of high school operates as the central training ground in the ruthlessly competitive values and viciously hierarchical social structure of American capitalism. Through a series of homologies, Westerberg High School becomes a metaphor for American life and culture during the Reagan and George Herbert Bush administrations. The conflict between democratic values and the social brutalities of 1980s consumer culture resides not just at the heart of the high school experience, but at the heart of 1980s American life.<ref>{{cite thesis|last=Connors|first=Clare|title=The Hollywood Youth Narrative and the Family Values Campaign, 1980\u20131992|date=2005|chapter=Heathers, High School and the Conflict Between Democratic Values and Consumer Culture|degree=Ph.D.|page=201|chapter-url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/305453239/|location=Pittsburgh, PA|publisher=[[University of Pittsburgh]]|id=Document No. 3192936|via=ProQuest Dissertations Publishing}}</ref>}}According to Christine Hubbard, this conflict often leads to minimal resolution: {{quote|Teens don\u2019t really want to change the world, they just want to feel that they had some say in its construction ...

She is part of a popular but feared clique that also consists of three other wealthy and beautiful girls with the same first name: Heather Chandler, Heather Duke, and Heather McNamara. She has grown tired of them and longs to return to her old life with her \"nerdy\" friends.\n\nOne day, new student and rebellious outsider Jason \"J.D.\" Dean pulls a gun and fires blanks on jocks Kurt Kelly and Ram Sweeney in response to them bullying him. Veronica observes this and finds herself fascinated. She later attends a frat party with Heather Chandler. After refusing to have sex with a frat brother, and vomiting on Chandler, the latter vows to destroy her reputation. J.D. shows up at Veronica's house, and they end up having sex outside. They express to each other their mutual hatred of Chandler's tyranny. The next morning, Veronica and J.D. break into Chandler's house. J.D. jokingly puts drain cleaner in a mug with the intention of giving it to Chandler but Veronica quickly shuts him down. She mixes orange juice and milk together instead as an attempt to make her throw up and get \nrevenge. However, she gets the cups mixed up. J.D. notices this, and hands Chandler the mug with the drain cleaner. She drinks it, crashes through a glass table, and dies. Veronica panics but J.D. urges her to forge a dramatic suicide note in Chandler's handwriting.\nThe school and community look on Chandler's apparent suicide as a tragic decision made by a troubled teenager, making her more worshipped in death than in life. Duke soon steps into the role of clique leader and begins wearing a red scrunchie that had belonged to Chandler.\n\nMcNamara convinces Veronica to go with her, Kurt and Ram on a double date, during which the boys end up drunk and pass out in cow manure. The following day, they spread a false rumor about Veronica performing oral sex on them, ruining her reputation. J.D. proposes that she lure them into the woods with the promise to \"make the rumors true,\" then shoot them with nonfatal bullets. J.D. shoots and kills Ram but Veronica misses Kurt, who runs away. J.D. chases Kurt back towards Veronica, who fatally shoots him. J.D. plants material next to the boys implying that they were gay, and a note stating the two were lovers participating in a suicide pact. Veronica then realises the bullets were real. At their funeral, the boys are made into martyrs against homophobia. Although she keeps dating J.D., Veronica is increasingly disturbed by his behavior. Martha Dunnstock, an obese student, pins a suicide note to her chest and walks into traffic. She survives but is badly injured, and she is mocked for trying to \"act like the popular kids.\" McNamara calls a radio show one night while Veronica and Duke are listening and talks of depression in her life; the next day, Duke tells the entire school about the radio call. McNamara attempts to take her life by overdosing in the girls' bathroom but she is saved by Veronica. She tells J.D. that she will not participate in any more killings.\n\nJ.D. blackmails Duke into getting everyone to sign a petition that unbeknownst to her is intended to act as a mass suicide note. Veronica has a nightmare where J.D. kills Duke, and she sees the undead Chandler at the funeral. She wakes up and writes what appears a suicide note in her diary, then stages a hanging (actually tying a harness around her waist to support her weight) for J.D. to see as he climbs into her room with a revolver. Assuming she is dead, J.D. rambles about his intent to kill her, had she not committed suicide, and his plan to blow up the school during a pep rally. Veronica reveals to her mother that she is not dead, and at school the next day, she confronts J.D. in the boiler room while he is planting dynamite. She shoots him when he refuses to stop the bombing. As J.D. collapses, his switchblade cuts the wires to the detonator, and it stops. Veronica walks out through the pep rally while everyone is cheering. The severely injured J.D. follows her outside with a bomb strapped to his chest, offers a personal eulogy, and detonates the bomb. She confronts Duke, takes the red scrunchie, and vows to change the way things are. She then invites Martha Dunnstock to hang out on prom night and watch movies with her. Martha and Veronica head down the hallway while Duke watches.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Winona Ryder]] as Veronica Sawyer\n* [[Christian Slater]] as Jason \"J.D.\" Dean\n* [[Shannen Doherty]] as Heather Duke\n* [[Lisanne Falk]] as Heather McNamara\n* [[Kim Walker (actress)|Kim Walker]] as Heather Chandler\n* [[Penelope Milford]] as Pauline Fleming\n* [[Glenn Shadix]] as Father Ripper\n* Lance Fenton as Kurt Kelly\n* [[Patrick Labyorteaux]] as Ram Sweeney\n* Jeremy Applegate as Peter Dawson\n* Em Lodge as M.C.

After a number of failed attempts to get the script to Kubrick, Waters approached director [[Michael Lehmann]], who agreed to helm the film with producer [[Denise Di Novi]].\n\nIn the original version of the script, J.D. successfully blows up Westerburg High, and the final scene features a surreal prom gathering of all the students in heaven.

According to Clare Connors' scathing rebuke, ''Heathers'' reveals that conflict as arising within the heart of the American high school: {{quote|On one hand, the high school serves as an icon of American democracy and longing for social justice and equality, one place in American life where every young citizen can access equal opportunity and upward mobility. On the other hand, the cultural life of high school operates as the central training ground in the ruthlessly competitive values and viciously hierarchical social structure of American capitalism. Through a series of homologies, Westerberg High School becomes a metaphor for American life and culture during the Reagan and George Herbert Bush administrations. The conflict between democratic values and the social brutalities of 1980s consumer culture resides not just at the heart of the high school experience, but at the heart of 1980s American life.<ref>{{cite thesis|last=Connors|first=Clare|title=The Hollywood Youth Narrative and the Family Values Campaign, 1980\u20131992|date=2005|chapter=Heathers, High School and the Conflict Between Democratic Values and Consumer Culture|degree=Ph.D.|page=201|chapter-url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/305453239/|location=Pittsburgh, PA|publisher=[[University of Pittsburgh]]|id=Document No. 3192936|via=ProQuest Dissertations Publishing}}</ref>}}According to Christine Hubbard, this conflict often leads to minimal resolution: {{quote|Teens don\u2019t really want to change the world, they just want to feel that they had some say in its construction ...

She was built for the White Star Line by [[Harland and Wolff]], at [[Belfast]], to serve the [[Olympic class liner|''Olympic''-class]] [[ocean liner]]s. \n\n==Background==\nTraffic was one of the vessels commissioned by the White Star Line in 1910 to tender for their new ocean liners {{RMS|Olympic}} and {{RMS|Titanic}}, which were too large to dock in Cherbourg harbour. She and her running mate SS Nomadic ferried passengers, their baggage, mail and ship's supplies to and from large ocean liners moored offshore. She was designed by [[Thomas Andrews]] who also designed RMS ''Titanic''.\n \nHarland and Wolff laid down Traffic's keel on 22 December 1910 (yard number 423). She was built on slipway No. 1 next to her sister Nomadic and alongside the SS Patriotic. Later the constructions of the {{RMS|Olympic}} and {{RMS|Titanic}} will be started. Which were constructed on slipways 2 and 3, of the [[Arrol Gantry]], respectively and launched her on 27 April 1911, two days after her running mate, [[SS Nomadic]].\n\n==Construction==\nThe ship is 175 feet (53.5 m) long overall and 35 ft (10.7 m) wide, with a gross registered [[tonnage]] of 675 tons. Propulsion was provided by two single-ended coal-fired boilers and two compound steam engines, each driving two triple-bladed propellers of 7 feet (2.1 m) in diameter, which gave a service speed of 12 knots (14 mph; 22 km/h).\n\n''Traffic'' is of steel construction, with steel frames, beams, bulkheads and riveted hull plating. She had four working decks with various hold spaces beneath. She could carry up to 1,200 passengers when fully loaded.\n\nThe ''Traffic'' was fitted with electric baggage conveyors, one at the fore end and one at the after end of the bridge deck, for conveying baggage to and from the upper deck. She will also have accommodations to transporting a large number of passengers, and a complete installation of electric lights.\n\nHer interior accommodations were never documented. Based off of Nomadic, she would have had fittings similar to that of Olympic and Titanic's 3rd Class General and Smoking Rooms, she either have wooden floor or linoleum tiles. With long benches and wooden furniture. Many benches were placed on the decks of the Traffic so passengers can sit almost everywhere on the ship. \n\n==Early life serving ''Olympic'' & ''Titanic''==\nThe vessel then underwent sea trials on 18 May 1911, before being handed over to the White Star Line on 27 May 1911. Two days later, on 29 May, ''Nomadic'' and ''Traffic'' attended {{RMS|Olympic}} as she carried out her sea trials. The two tenders then sailed to [[Southampton]], and then on to [[Cherbourg]], where they were based. ''Traffic'' carried third class passengers, as well as mail, cargo and baggage, out to the White Star Line's large ocean liners, while ''Nomadic'' carried first and second class passengers. ''Traffic'' took passengers and mail out to ''Titanic'' on 10 April 1912 while the liner lay moored in the roads off the port, preparatory to beginning her maiden voyage across the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]. ''Traffic'' could accommodate 1,200 third-class passengers, considerably more than ''Olympic'' and ''Titanic's'' actual third-class passenger capacity. Despite this, ''Nomadic'' also had a small third-class area below deck to accommodate for ''Traffic's'' over-spill of passengers.\n\n==Wartime and postwar==\n''Traffic'' continued as a tender during the [[First World War]],served as a minesweeper for the French Navy between 1917 and 1919, supported [[troop transport]]s and carrying British, American and Canadian troops at the end of the First World War. ''Traffic'' and ''Nomadic'' were sold to Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Cherbourgeoise Transbordement in 1927, and continued to serve as tenders, but now called on any large vessels using the port. ''Traffic'' accidentally collided with {{RMS|Homeric|1922|6}} on 5 June 1929, and sustained some damage to the starboard side of the hull. After enquiries revealed that ''Traffic'' was notoriously difficult to handle, new propellers were produced by Harland and Wolff and fitted in October 1929. The new propellers proved effective, but ''Traffic'' was nevertheless involved in another collision in December, 1929, this time involving {{SS|Minnewaska|1923|6}} of the [[Atlantic Transport Line]]. There was only minor damage. ''Minnewaska'' was involved in another collision two years later, this time with ''Nomadic'' on 29 November 1931, during which ''Nomadic''{{'}}s bow was damaged. ''Nomadic'' and ''Traffic''{{'}}s owners became Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Cherbourgeoise de Remorquage et de Sauvetage in 1934, and both ships were repainted in the new livery and renamed, ''Traffic'' becoming ''Ing\u00e9nieur Riebell'' and ''Nomadic'' ''Ing\u00e9nieur Minard''.\n\n==Scrapping==\nIn September 1939, Ingenieur Reibell was once again requisitioned by the [[French Navy]], and this time transformed into a mine layer ship, registered as X23. When the German army took control of the port in June 1940 X23 was sunk in the harbor. Afterwards the ship was raised and used as a coastal patroller. Due to her disappointing performance in this role, she can only run 6 knots (for which she was not designed) they simply scrapped the former tender at Cherbourg.

She was built for the White Star Line by [[Harland and Wolff]], at [[Belfast]], to serve the [[Olympic class liner|''Olympic''-class]] [[ocean liner]]s. \n\n==Background==\nTraffic was one of the vessel commissioned by the White Star Line in 1910 to tender for their new ocean liners {{RMS|Olympic}} and {{RMS|Titanic}}, which were too large to dock in Cherbourg harbour. She and her running mate SS Nomadic ferried passengers, their baggage, mail and ship's supplies to and from large ocean liners moored offshore. She was designed by [[Thomas Andrews]] who also designed RMS ''Titanic''.\n \nHarland and Wolff laid down Traffic's keel on 22 December 1910 (yard number 423). She was built on slipway No. 1 next to her sister Nomadic and alongside the SS Patriotic. Later the constructions of the {{RMS|Olympic}} and {{RMS|Titanic}} will be started. Which were constructed on slipways 2 and 3, of the [[Arrol Gantry]], respectively and launched her on 27 April 1911, two days after her running mate, [[SS Nomadic]].\n\n==Construction==\nThe ship is 175 feet (53.5 m) long overall and 35 ft (10.7 m) wide, with a gross registered [[tonnage]] of 675 tons. Propulsion was provided by two single-ended coal-fired boilers and two compound steam engines, each driving two triple-bladed propellers of 7 feet (2.1 m) in diameter, which gave a service speed of 12 knots (14 mph; 22 km/h).\n\n''Traffic'' is of steel construction, with steel frames, beams, bulkheads and riveted hull plating. She had four working decks with various hold spaces beneath. She could carry up to 1,200 passengers when fully loaded.\n\nThe ''Traffic'' was fitted with electric baggage conveyors, one at the fore end and one at the after end of the bridge deck, for conveying baggage to and from the upper deck. She will also have accommodations to transporting a large number of passengers, and a complete installation of electric lights.\n\nHer interior accommodations were never documented. Based off of Nomadic, she would have had fittings similar to that of Olympic and Titanic's 3rd Class General and Smoking Rooms, she either have wooden floor or linoleum tiles. With long benches and wooden furniture. Many benches were placed on the decks of the Traffic so passengers can sit almost everywhere on the ship. \n\n==Early life serving ''Olympic'' & ''Titanic''==\nThe vessel then underwent sea trials on 18 May 1911, before being handed over to the White Star Line on 27 May 1911. Two days later, on 29 May, ''Nomadic'' and ''Traffic'' attended {{RMS|Olympic}} as she carried out her sea trials. The two tenders then sailed to [[Southampton]], and then on to [[Cherbourg]], where they were based. ''Traffic'' carried third class passengers, as well as mail, cargo and baggage, out to the White Star Line's large ocean liners, while ''Nomadic'' carried first and second class passengers. ''Traffic'' took passengers and mail out to ''Titanic'' on 10 April 1912 while the liner lay moored in the roads off the port, preparatory to beginning her maiden voyage across the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]. ''Traffic'' could accommodate 1,200 third-class passengers, considerably more than ''Olympic'' and ''Titanic's'' actual third-class passenger capacity. Despite this, ''Nomadic'' also had a small third-class area below deck to accommodate for ''Traffic's'' over-spill of passengers.\n\n==Wartime and postwar==\n''Traffic'' continued as a tender during the [[First World War]],served as a minesweeper for the French Navy between 1917 and 1919, supported [[troop transport]]s and carrying British, American and Canadian troops at the end of the First World War. ''Traffic'' and ''Nomadic'' were sold to Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Cherbourgeoise Transbordement in 1927, and continued to serve as tenders, but now called on any large vessels using the port. ''Traffic'' accidentally collided with {{RMS|Homeric|1922|6}} on 5 June 1929, and sustained some damage to the starboard side of the hull. After enquiries revealed that ''Traffic'' was notoriously difficult to handle, new propellers were produced by Harland and Wolff and fitted in October 1929. The new propellers proved effective, but ''Traffic'' was nevertheless involved in another collision in December, 1929, this time involving {{SS|Minnewaska|1923|6}} of the [[Atlantic Transport Line]]. There was only minor damage. ''Minnewaska'' was involved in another collision two years later, this time with ''Nomadic'' on 29 November 1931, during which ''Nomadic''{{'}}s bow was damaged. ''Nomadic'' and ''Traffic''{{'}}s owners became Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Cherbourgeoise de Remorquage et de Sauvetage in 1934, and both ships were repainted in the new livery and renamed, ''Traffic'' becoming ''Ing\u00e9nieur Riebell'' and ''Nomadic'' ''Ing\u00e9nieur Minard''.\n\n==Scrapping==\nIn September 1939, Ingenieur Reibell was once again requisitioned by the [[French Navy]], and this time transformed into a mine layer ship, registered as X23.
