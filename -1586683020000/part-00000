It is produced by [[Bhushan Kumar]], [[Krishan Kumar (actor)|Krishan Kumar]] and Lizelle D'Souza under the banners [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]] and Remo D'Souza Entertainment. The film stars [[Varun Dhawan]], [[Shraddha Kapoor]], [[Prabhu Deva]] and [[Nora Fatehi]]. Its music is composed by [[Sachin\u2013Jigar]], [[Tanishk Bagchi]], [[Badshah (rapper)|Badshah]], [[Guru Randhawa]], Gurinder Seagal and Harsh Upadhyay, and released under the banner T-Series. The story explores a dance competition between some [[Indian people|Indian]] and [[Pakistani]] dancers.\n\nOriginally planned as a sequel to Disney's ''[[ABCD 2]]'' (2015), the film was taken off the title due to Disney's exit from Indian film production, and was instead renamed to its current title after Bhushan Kumar took over as producer. Filming commenced in February 2019 in [[Punjab]], later moved to [[London]] and was wrapped up in July 2019. It was theatrically released in India on 24 January 2020.\n\n==Plot==\nInder Singh Narula ([[Punit Pathak]]) is a dancer who is part of a dance team named Street Dancer. Inder is dancing at the Ground Zero Battle with his brother Sahej Singh Narula ([[Varun Dhawan]]) cheering for him and while doing a flip stunt, he lands on his leg and injures it. After two years, he is healing, but cannot dance. Sahej forms Street Dancer again and converts it into a studio through money whose sources he is hesitant about revealing. Poddy ([[Raghav Juyal]]), is one of Sahej's close friends, along with D ([[Dharmesh Yelande]]) and Sushi (Sushant Pujari), who are all part of Street Dancer. While showing the dance studio to the Street Dancer team, they run into Inayat ([[Shraddha Kapoor]]) and her team, the Rule Breakers, dance as well. Sahej and Inayat have always been at standstills against each other and they have a dance battle. The Rule Breakers beat Street Dancer, embarrassing Sahej in the process. Inayat's cousin, Zain ([[Salman Yusuff Khan]]), takes her home. Their family is very orthodox and Inayat lies about her dancing, hiding the truth from them. \n\nSahej visits the Royals, an all time, record-holding dance group that always wins the Ground Zero Competition. His girlfriend, Mia ([[Nora Fatehi]]) is on the team, and she is an incredible dancer. They discuss on how irritated Sahej is by Inayat, and she calms him down. Mia trains the Street Dancer gang, giving them the spark they wanted. The two gangs meet up in a restaurant for a cricket match between India (Sahej's team) and Pakistan (Inayat's team). India wins and this leads to a dance battle where Mia shows her moves. The police and the restaurant manager, Ram Prasad a.k.a. Anna ([[Prabhu Deva]]) control the fight. As they leave, Inayat sees some homeless people entering the restaurant from the back door. She follows them and meets Ram. He explains to her that these are illegal immigrants, and he feeds them food that isn't used. He takes her to an area where many illegal immigrants reside. He tells her that they can't go back to their home as they have no money. She gets emotional and begins to help them.\n\nOne day when Poddy reaches the dance studio, he sees Sahej being interrogated by the cop. Sahej reveals that when he went to India for his cousin's marriage, he met Amrinder Mehrotra ([[Aparshakti Khurana]]) and his three other friends playing drum in the marriage. He was impressed by their talent. They request Sahej to take them to London which he denies. After they offer a huge amount of 40 lakhs he agrees to take them to London. That's how he got the money to buy the dance studio. Poddy promises to not tell it to anyone.\n\nThe Ground Zero Battle returns. Inder asks Sahej to participate and win it. Inayat decides to participate so that they can use the money to help the illegal immigrants and Ram supports her. The two gangs meet and Ram says that if they become one they can easily win the competition. But both of them deny the offer. Sahej impresses the Royals with his dance at a nightclub. He, D, Poddy and Sushi are selected for the Royals. The two gangs meet in the restaurant again. They have an argument, which ends up with Ram dancing, showcasing his ability to Sahej. Sahej, blinded by his ego, turns down the opportunity. Poddy is in a relationship with Alisha, a girl from Inayat's gang. He realises that Inayat's gang are participating in the Ground Zero Battle so that they can retrieve them the prize money  which is a hundred thousand pounds to help illegal immigrants and tells Sahej about it at the Royals dance studio. Sahej does not believe Poddy and a fight ensues between the both of them. This causes Poddy to leave the Royals and he decides to join the Rule Breakers. Inayat accepts Poddy into the team and other members of the Street Dancer team also feel left out as Sahej spends his time with the Royals. \n\nThe first round of the competition is easily surpassed by both the Royals and the Rule Breakers. As Sahej, D and Shushi gets into a bus, they run into Amrinder. Amrinder tells Sahej that after he dropped them off, they went to a hostel. Over there, all illegal immigrants were staying and they were chased by the police. Leaving his identity as a Sikh and his passport, he and the three Punjabi drummers joined the homeless people. Inayat's gang were dancing to help them. He asks Sahej for help but he leaves saying he does not know him.\n\nBoth teams surpass the quarter finals and enter into semi finals. Later, the Royals and Sahej are walking in London. They run into the drummers where the leader of the Royals accidentally breaks his drums. After seeing them, Sahej feels guilty of his deeds. In the semi final round, Sahej leaves the Royals and helps Inayat's gang win the round. He then quits the Royals, breaking Mia\u2019s heart, and forms Street Dancer again.\n\nMany practices occur, and then Inayat's family finds out about her dancing actions. They ban her from dancing, shocking the team. Sahej and Zain go to her house, and convince her family to let her dance. A relationship blossoms between Sahej and Inayat as they prepare for the final round of the Ground Zero Battle. The Royals perform and amazes the crowd. Street Dancer performs and in the middle of their dance, a member of the Royals take off the music. The host tells them that if there is no music, they cannot dance. Amrinder then uses his drums with his friends to make music for them to dance to. The leader of the Royals finds out that his team member took off the music and he asks to puts it back in, since he did not want to cheat. At the end of their dance, Sahej does the flip stunt, which got his brother injured, flawlessly. Making his brother and his country proud, Sahej gets Street Dancer to defeat the Royals and wins the competition, also earning the Royals\u2019 respect. In the end, Sahej and Inayat begin a friendship as they help the immigrants.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Varun Dhawan]] as Sahej Singh Narula, an aspiring dancer who follows his brother's footsteps.

Filming commenced in February 2019 in [[Punjab]], later moved to [[London]] and was wrapped up in July 2019. It was theatrically released in India on 24 January 2020.\n\n==Plot==\nInder Singh Narula ([[Punit Pathak]]) is a dancer who is part of a dance team named Street Dancer. Inder is dancing at the Ground Zero Battle with his brother Sahej Singh Narula ([[Varun Dhawan]]) cheering for him and while doing a flip stunt, he lands on his leg and injures it. After two years, he is healing, but cannot dance. Sahej forms Street Dancer again and converts it into a studio through money whose sources he is hesitant about revealing. Poddy ([[Raghav Juyal]]), is one of Sahej's close friends, along with D ([[Dharmesh Yelande]]) and Sushi (Sushant Pujari), who are all part of Street Dancer. While showing the dance studio to the Street Dancer team, they run into Inayat ([[Shraddha Kapoor]]) and her team, the Rule Breakers, dance as well. Sahej and Inayat have always been at standstills against each other and they have a dance battle. The Rule Breakers beat Street Dancer, embarrassing Sahej in the process. Inayat's cousin, Zain ([[Salman Yusuff Khan]]), takes her home. Their family is very orthodox and Inayat lies about her dancing, hiding the truth from them. \n\nSahej visits the Royals, an all time, record-holding dance group that always wins the Ground Zero Competition. His girlfriend, Mia ([[Nora Fatehi]]) is on the team, and she is an incredible dancer. They discuss on how irritated Sahej is by Inayat, and she calms him down. Mia trains the Street Dancer gang, giving them the spark they wanted. The two gangs meet up in a restaurant for a cricket match between India (Sahej's team) and Pakistan (Inayat's team). India wins and this leads to a dance battle where Mia shows her moves. The police and the restaurant manager, Ram Prasad a.k.a. Anna ([[Prabhu Deva]]) control the fight. As they leave, Inayat sees some homeless people entering the restaurant from the back door. She follows them and meets Ram. He explains to her that these are illegal immigrants, and he feeds them food that isn't used. He takes her to an area where many illegal immigrants reside. He tells her that they can't go back to their home as they have no money. She gets emotional and begins to help them.\n\nOne day when Poddy reaches the dance studio, he sees Sahej being interrogated by the cop. Sahej reveals that when he went to India for his cousin's marriage, he met Amrinder Mehrotra ([[Aparshakti Khurana]]) and his three other friends playing drum in the marriage. He was impressed by their talent. They request Sahej to take them to London which he denies. After they offer a huge amount of 40 lakhs he agrees to take them to London. That's how he got the money to buy the dance studio. Poddy promises to not tell it to anyone.\n\nThe Ground Zero Battle returns. Inder asks Sahej to participate and win it. Inayat decides to participate so that they can use the money to help the illegal immigrants and Ram supports her. The two gangs meet and Ram says that if they become one they can easily win the competition. But both of them deny the offer. Sahej impresses the Royals with his dance at a nightclub. He, D, Poddy and Sushi are selected for the Royals. The two gangs meet in the restaurant again. They have an argument, which ends up with Ram dancing, showcasing his ability to Sahej. Sahej, blinded by his ego, turns down the opportunity. Poddy is in a relationship with Alisha, a girl from Inayat's gang. He realises that Inayat's gang are participating in the Ground Zero Battle so that they can retrieve them the prize money  which is a hundred thousand pounds to help illegal immigrants and tells Sahej about it at the Royals dance studio. Sahej does not believe Poddy and a fight ensues between the both of them. This causes Poddy to leave the Royals and he decides to join the Rule Breakers. Inayat accepts Poddy into the team and other members of the Street Dancer team also feel left out as Sahej spends his time with the Royals. \n\nThe first round of the competition is easily surpassed by both the Royals and the Rule Breakers. As Sahej, D and Shushi gets into a bus, they run into Amrinder. Amrinder tells Sahej that after he dropped them off, they went to a hostel. Over there, all illegal immigrants were staying and they were chased by the police. Leaving his identity as a Sikh and his passport, he and the three Punjabi drummers joined the homeless people. Inayat's gang were dancing to help them. He asks Sahej for help but he leaves saying he does not know him.\n\nBoth teams surpass the quarter finals and enter into semi finals. Later, the Royals and Sahej are walking in London. They run into the drummers where the leader of the Royals accidentally breaks his drums. After seeing them, Sahej feels guilty of his deeds. In the semi final round, Sahej leaves the Royals and helps Inayat's gang win the round. He then quits the Royals, breaking Mia\u2019s heart, and forms Street Dancer again.\n\nMany practices occur, and then Inayat's family finds out about her dancing actions. They ban her from dancing, shocking the team. Sahej and Zain go to her house, and convince her family to let her dance. A relationship blossoms between Sahej and Inayat as they prepare for the final round of the Ground Zero Battle. The Royals perform and amazes the crowd. Street Dancer performs and in the middle of their dance, a member of the Royals take off the music. The host tells them that if there is no music, they cannot dance. Amrinder then uses his drums with his friends to make music for them to dance to. The leader of the Royals finds out that his team member took off the music and he asks to puts it back in, since he did not want to cheat. At the end of their dance, Sahej does the flip stunt, which got his brother injured, flawlessly.

The team is based in [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]]. The Kings were formed from a merger between the [[Bankstown Bruins|West Sydney Westars]] and the [[Sydney Supersonics]] in October 1987. They were the first team to win three consecutive championships in the NBL and currently sit fifth behind the [[Adelaide 36ers]] and [[New Zealand Breakers]] (four each), [[Melbourne United]] (five) and [[Perth Wildcats]] (nine) for championships won. The Kings play their home games at the [[Qudos Bank Arena]] in [[Sydney Olympic Park, New South Wales]].\n\n== History ==\n=== 1988\u20132002: First 15 years ===\nThe Kings were formed from a merger between the [[Bankstown Bruins|West Sydney Westars]] and the [[Sydney Supersonics]] in October 1987.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cockerill|first=Michael|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=lL5f5cZgq8MC&dat=19871015&printsec=frontpage&hl=en|title=One-team saviour for basketball|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=15 October 1987|accessdate=10 April 2018|page=47 (48)}}</ref> The team adopted the purple-and-gold colours traditionally linked with the most winning team in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] during the 1980s, the [[Los Angeles Lakers]].\n\nBefore the merger, no Sydney-based teams had ever made the final four in NBL competition. That changed in 1989, when the Kings finished fifth with a 15-9 record and advanced to the semi-finals with a 2-1 win over the [[Melbourne Tigers]]. After splitting their first two games in the semi-finals, the Kings were humiliated by the [[Canberra Cannons]] 142-82 in the series-deciding third game.\n\nSydney made the playoffs in 1990, losing in the first round to the [[Brisbane Bullets]]. In 1992, led by imports [[Dwayne McClain]] (who was named to the [[NBL (Australia) All NBL teams|All-NBL First Team]]) and Ken McClary (ranked 5th in the league in [[Rebound (basketball)|rebounds]]), the Kings finished second on the ladder. This time they advanced to the semi-finals and were beaten by the Tigers, who would eventually lose to the [[South-East Melbourne Magic]] in the championship series.\n\nOver the next few years the Kings, despite the rich pockets of private owner Mike Wrublewski, earned a reputation for being chronic under-achievers. The team featured high profile players like Leon Trimmingham,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aussiehoopla.com/leon-trimmingham-sydney-kings-podcast/|title=Leon Trimmingham (Sydney Kings Legend) Podcast #23|website=Aussie Hoopla|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-07}}</ref> Mario Donaldson, Dean Uthoff and Phil Smyth during the mid-90s but they failed to make the playoffs in 1993 or 1995, and were eliminated in the first round in 1994 and 1996. The team soon received the nickname of '[[Violet Crumble|The Violet Crumbles]]', a popular chocolate sold in purple wrapper; the joke being that the team was wrapped in purple and shattered under pressure. 'The Cardiac Kids' was another tag, for the team's frequency in getting involved in close, thrilling games.\n\nAfter their 1996 elimination, the Kings would not make the NBL playoffs again until 2001, when they made it to the first round before being eliminated by the [[Townsville Crocodiles]]. Australian Olympic team guard [[Shane Heal]] was recruited to lead the team, and he finished second in the league in scoring average, behind Olympic teammate [[Andrew Gaze]]. Heal finished third in scoring average in the 2001\u201302 season, but the Kings again failed to make the playoffs.\n\n=== 2003\u20132008: Championships era ===\nFor the 2002\u201303 season, Heal was joined by talented imports [[Chris Williams (basketball)|Chris Williams]] and [[Kavossy Franklin]]. The team also welcomed the NBL's all-time leader in coaching victories, [[Brian Goorjian]]. The Kings finished on top of the ladder with a 22-8 record, and swept the [[Perth Wildcats]] 2-0 in the grand final series to claim their first-ever championship.\n\nWith Goorjian able to implement his defensive tactics which were so successful with the Spectres, Magic and Titans in Melbourne, there seemed to be no stopping the Kings, who were able to recruit quality imports like 2002\u201303 league MVP Chris Williams. In addition, many Victorian groomed players who had previously played for Goorijan such as [[Jason Smith (Australian basketball)|Jason Smith]] and [[Bradley Sheridan]] followed him north to Sydney.\n\nHeal retired after the 2002\u201303 season, and [[C. J. Bruton]] was recruited to take his place, Jason Smith was signed after returning to the NBL after playing in Europe but unfortunately was injured 13 games into the season and was replaced by import [[Chris Carrawell]]. The Kings started the 2003\u201304 season with 10 successive wins, and would eventually win their second championship after their best-of-five grand final series with crosstown rivals [[Sydney Spirit|West Sydney Razorbacks]] went down to the deciding fifth game. Kings player [[Matthew Nielsen|Matt Nielsen]] would win the regular season and finals [[NBL (Australia) Most Valuable Player|MVP]] in 2003\u201304 before leaving to play overseas.\n\nThe Kings again performed strongly in the 2004\u201305 season despite a disastrous early game against Townsville which saw C. J. Bruton out for weeks with an elbow injury, and a season ending torn [[Anterior cruciate ligament|ACL]] for rookie of the year candidate [[Luke Kendall]]. The Kings managed without their starting backcourt until Bruton came back and they signed import big man Rolan Roberts. Arguably stronger than before the Kings finished on top of the ladder and crushed the [[Wollongong Hawks]] in three straight games to become the first team in Australian league history to win three consecutive championships. Jason Smith was named the NBL Finals Most Valuable Player.\n\nIn the 2005\u201306 season, the Kings again finished atop the ladder and made it to the grand final. Import centre Rolan Roberts suffered a torn pectoral muscle imitating a [[Vince Carter]] dunk during the All Star dunk competition and was replaced by [[Sedric Webber]]. In the finals they were swept 3-0 by the [[Chris Anstey]] led [[Melbourne Tigers]].\n\nThe club was then purchased in 2006 for $2 million by the chairman of fuel technology company [[Firepower International]], Tim Johnston. Johnston later sold a part share in 2007 to 31-year-old Dorry Kordahi, CEO and owner of DKM.\n\n=== 2008\u20132010: Club demise ===\nOn 24 March 2008, coach Brian Goorjian quit the club after a mutual agreement,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/indepth/kings-target-tomlinson/story-e6freyj0-1111115894679 |title=Goorjian aide next in line for Kings job |first=Tim |last=Morrissey |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=Australia |date=27 March 2008 |accessdate=20 March 2012 }}</ref> and on 12 June 2008, the NBL terminated the Sydney team's licence as Firepower collapsed and the Kings were unable to pay player salaries.<ref name=NBL>{{cite press release |publisher=NBL |year=2008 |url=http://www.nbl.com.au/default.aspx?s=newsdisplay&id=75174 |title=NBL terminates Kings licence |access-date=12 June 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001933/http://www.nbl.com.au/default.aspx?s=newsdisplay&id=75174 |archive-date=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== 2010\u20132012: Kings relaunch ===\nUnder a revised management structure and ownership, the Sydney Kings relaunched for the [[2010\u201311 NBL season]], returning to the league after a two-year absence.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/more-sports/new-sydney-kings-owners-right-old-wrongs/story-e6frey6i-1225844944474 |title=New Sydney Kings owners right old wrongs |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=Australia |author=Otto, Tyson |date=25 March 2010 |access-date=20 March 2012 }}</ref> However, despite big-named additions such as [[Julian Khazzouh]], [[Ben Madgen]] and [[Luke Martin]], the Kings in their first season back finished in last place on the ladder with an 8\u201320 record.\n\nDue to the [[2011 NBA Lockout]], Australia's highest profile basketballer, former [[Milwaukee Bucks]] [[Center (basketball)|centre]] [[Andrew Bogut]], was looking to play in the NBL during the [[2011\u201312 NBL season|2011\u201312 season]]. He was linked with the [[Adelaide 36ers]], the [[Gold Coast Blaze]] and the Kings, whom Bogut had supported when growing up in Australia. Sydney was favored to secure his services and Bogut ultimately chose to make his NBL debut with the Kings. However, the insurance to cover his remaining US$39&nbsp;million contract with the Bucks couldn't be resolved, leaving the Kings and the NBL without the services of Australia's highest profile player. It was expected that Bogut's signing would see an increase in Kings membership and league attendances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/7066742/andrew-bogut-milwaukee-bucks-deal-australian-team-agent-says|title=Agent: Bogut's deal with Australian team is off|author=|date=|work=ESPN.go.com|access-date=21 February 2017}}</ref> Despite not being able to play, Bogut later expressed interest in joining the Kings' coaching staff during the lockout to help the club.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-sport/boguts-future-hinges-on-ankle-scans-20120316-1v9qc.html |title=Bogut's future hinges on ankle scans |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |author=Hand, Guy |date=16 March 2012 |agency=AAP |access-date=20 March 2012 }}</ref> This ultimately did not happen either.\n\nThe Kings fared better in 2011\u201312, finishing the season in seventh spot with an 11\u201317 record.\n\n=== 2012\u20132018: Continued struggles ===\nThe Kings continued to struggle over the ensuing six years, qualifying just once (2012\u201313) for the playoffs in their eight seasons since returning to the league, and finishing with a losing record in the regular season in each of their eight seasons. In November 2015, the club played their 800th game in franchise history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sydneykings.com/team-news/800-up-for-kings/|title=800 up for Kings \u2013 Official Website of the Sydney Kings|author=|date=6 November 2015|work=SydneyKings.com|access-date=21 February 2017}}</ref> Australian basketball icon [[Andrew Gaze]] was named head coach of the team on a three year deal starting with the 2016\u201317 season. The team recruited big names [[Kevin Lisch]], [[Brad Newley]] and [[Aleks Mari\u0107]] plus imports [[Greg Whittington]] and [[Michael Bryson]] for the 2016\u201317 season; however after starting the season with five wins in their opening six games, the Kings won just eight of their remaining 22 games and missed the playoffs.\n\nBefore the 2017\u201318 season, the team recruited imports [[Perry Ellis]] and [[Travis Leslie]] plus small forward [[Todd Blanchfield]]; however fared no better, losing 16 of their first 21 games as Lisch suffered a calf injury that would force him to miss most of the regular season. Late in the campaign the club brought in 2016\u201317 NBL MVP [[Jerome Randle]] and big man Jeremy Tyler. Randle led the team to six wins in their final seven games and was named to the All-NBL Second Team, but the Kings missed the playoffs for the fifth consecutive season.\n\n=== 2018\u2013present ===\nThe 2018\u201319 season will be the Kings' 30th anniversary season in the NBL. On 24 April 2018, the Kings announced the signing of Australian basketball icon, [[Andrew Bogut]]. In that same offseason, the Kings became the first beneficiary of the NBL's new \"Next Stars\" player development initiative, which offers a professional option immediately out of secondary school to Americans (who are currently barred from the NBA draft until one year after graduation), as well as Australians and New Zealanders considering U.S. college basketball. The team was assigned American [[Brian Bowen]], who was unable to play college basketball after being caught up in the sport's [[2017\u201318 NCAA Division I men's basketball corruption scandal|ongoing corruption scandal]] and signed a \"Next Stars\" contract with the league.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.sydneykings.com/news/article/38851-38851-2 |title=Sydney Kings unveil Next Star Brian Bowen |publisher=Sydney Kings |date=7 August 2018 |accessdate=7 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Home arena ==\nThe Sydney Kings' first home venue was the [[State Sports Centre]] located at [[Homebush, New South Wales|Homebush]]. After playing at the 5,006-seat venue in 1988 and 1989, the Kings then moved into Sydney's largest indoor venue, the 12,500-seat [[Sydney Entertainment Centre]] in 1990. The SEC, known for Kings games as \"The Kingdome\", would be the Kings' home until the team moved back to Homebush in 1999 and into the new, 18,200-capacity [[Sydney Super Dome]] which had been built as the main [[Basketball at the 2000 Summer Olympics|basketball]] and [[Gymnastics at the 2000 Summer Olympics|gymnastics]] venue for the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] held in Sydney.\n\nDespite attracting an NBL record 17,143 crowd for their opening-round game in the 1999/2000 season against the Canberra Cannons (played as a double header with the West Sydney Razorbacks playing the Brisbane Bullets), the Kings' time at the Super Dome only lasted three years. After the club went into voluntary administration following the 2001/2002 season and was then purchased by a new investment group, the franchise decided to move back to the Entertainment Centre in 2002, citing falling attendances and the high cost of playing their games at the NBA-size venue. It was also speculated at the time that the core of the Kings fan base came from the eastern and northern suburbs of Sydney and that fans were not enthused about having to travel to Homebush for games.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nThe Kings moved back to the Entertainment Centre in 2002, where they remained until 2015, though they were forced to move one game in the [[2012\u201313 NBL season]] to the State Sports Centre due to a pre-booked event taking priority at the Entertainment Centre. At its closing in 2015, the SEC had a basketball capacity of 10,517 (with curtains blocking off seats behind the basket to reduce capacity) giving the Kings the second-largest capacity venue in the NBL behind the 14,846-seat [[Perth Arena]], though as the SEC was opened in 1983 it also gave the Kings the league's oldest venue.\n\nThe Kings moved back to Homebush midway through the 2015\u201316 season due to the SEC being demolished to make way for an apartment complex and convention centre. On 13 March 2016, the Kings came under new management and were subsequently moved back to the Superdome (Qudos Bank Arena) for the 2016\u201317 season. During the regular season, the Kings curtained off the upper deck of the Qudos Bank Arena (depending on ticket demand), leaving capacity at approximately 9,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbl.com.au/featured-news/31131/|title=New ownership for Sydney Kings \u2013 NBL \u2013 The National Basketball League|author=|date=13 March 2016|work=NBL.com.au|access-date=21 February 2017}}</ref> In the final home game of the 2016\u201317 season, the Kings drew 11,005 fans to their game against Melbourne United \u2013 the second largest home crowd in franchise history.\n\n* [[State Sports Centre]] (1988\u20131989, 2012, 2016)\n* [[Sydney Entertainment Centre]] (1990\u20131999, 2002\u20132008, 2010\u20132015)\n* [[Sydney Super Dome]]  (1999\u20132002, 2016\u2013present)\n\n== Honour and awards ==\n{{columns-start|num=3}}\n;[[List of NBL champions|NBL champions]]\n* 2003, 2004, 2005\n\n;[[NBL Most Valuable Player Award|NBL Most Valuable Player]]\n* [[Chris Williams (basketball)|Chris Williams]] \u2013 2003\n* [[Matthew Nielsen]] \u2013 2004\n* [[Andrew Bogut]] \u2013 2019\n\n;[[NBL Grand Final Most Valuable Player Award|NBL Grand Final MVP]]\n* [[Chris Williams (basketball)|Chris Williams]] \u2013 2003\n* [[Matthew Nielsen]] \u2013 2004\n* [[Jason Smith (basketball, born 1974)|Jason Smith]] \u2013 2005\n\n;[[All-NBL Team|All-NBL First Team]]\n* [[Dwayne McClain]] \u2013 1992\n* Leon Trimmingham \u2013 1994\n* [[Shane Heal]] \u2013 2003\n* [[Chris Williams (basketball)|Chris Williams]] \u2013 2003\n* [[Matthew Nielsen]] \u2013 2004\n* [[Jason Smith (basketball, born 1974)|Jason Smith]] \u2013 2005\n* [[C.

The team is based in [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]]. The Kings were formed from a merger between the [[Bankstown Bruins|West Sydney Westars]] and the [[Sydney Supersonics]] in October 1987. They were the first team to win three consecutive championships in the NBL and currently sit fifth behind the [[Adelaide 36ers]] and [[New Zealand Breakers]] (four each), [[Melbourne United]] (five) and [[Perth Wildcats]] (nine) for championships won. The Kings play their home games at the [[Qudos Bank Arena]] in [[Sydney Olympic Park, New South Wales]].\n\n== History ==\n=== 1988\u20132002: First 15 years ===\nThe Kings were formed from a merger between the [[Bankstown Bruins|West Sydney Westars]] and the [[Sydney Supersonics]] in October 1987.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cockerill|first=Michael|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=lL5f5cZgq8MC&dat=19871015&printsec=frontpage&hl=en|title=One-team saviour for basketball|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=15 October 1987|accessdate=10 April 2018|page=47 (48)}}</ref> The team adopted the purple-and-gold colours traditionally linked with the most winning team in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] during the 1980s, the [[Los Angeles Lakers]].\n\nBefore the merger, no Sydney-based teams had ever made the final four in NBL competition. That changed in 1989, when the Kings finished fifth with a 15-9 record and advanced to the semi-finals with a 2-1 win over the [[Melbourne Tigers]]. After splitting their first two games in the semi-finals, the Kings were humiliated by the [[Canberra Cannons]] 142-82 in the series-deciding third game.\n\nSydney made the playoffs in 1990, losing in the first round to the [[Brisbane Bullets]]. In 1992, led by imports [[Dwayne McClain]] (who was named to the [[NBL (Australia) All NBL teams|All-NBL First Team]]) and Ken McClary (ranked 5th in the league in [[Rebound (basketball)|rebounds]]), the Kings finished second on the ladder. This time they advanced to the semi-finals and were beaten by the Tigers, who would eventually lose to the [[South-East Melbourne Magic]] in the championship series.\n\nOver the next few years the Kings, despite the rich pockets of private owner Mike Wrublewski, earned a reputation for being chronic under-achievers. The team featured high profile players like Leon Trimmingham,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aussiehoopla.com/leon-trimmingham-sydney-kings-podcast/|title=Leon Trimmingham (Sydney Kings Legend) Podcast #23|website=Aussie Hoopla|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-07}}</ref> Mario Donaldson, Dean Uthoff and Phil Smyth during the mid-90s but they failed to make the playoffs in 1993 or 1995, and were eliminated in the first round in 1994 and 1996. The team soon received the nickname of '[[Violet Crumble|The Violet Crumbles]]', a popular chocolate sold in purple wrapper; the joke being that the team was wrapped in purple and shattered under pressure. 'The Cardiac Kids' was another tag, for the team's frequency in getting involved in close, thrilling games.\n\nAfter their 1996 elimination, the Kings would not make the NBL playoffs again until 2001, when they made it to the first round before being eliminated by the [[Townsville Crocodiles]]. Australian Olympic team guard [[Shane Heal]] was recruited to lead the team, and he finished second in the league in scoring average, behind Olympic teammate [[Andrew Gaze]]. Heal finished third in scoring average in the 2001\u201302 season, but the Kings again failed to make the playoffs.\n\n=== 2003\u20132008: Championships era ===\nFor the 2002\u201303 season, Heal was joined by talented imports [[Chris Williams (basketball)|Chris Williams]] and [[Kavossy Franklin]]. The team also welcomed the NBL's all-time leader in coaching victories, [[Brian Goorjian]]. The Kings finished on top of the ladder with a 22-8 record, and swept the [[Perth Wildcats]] 2-0 in the grand final series to claim their first-ever championship.\n\nWith Goorjian able to implement his defensive tactics which were so successful with the Spectres, Magic and Titans in Melbourne, there seemed to be no stopping the Kings, who were able to recruit quality imports like 2002\u201303 league MVP Chris Williams. In addition, many Victorian groomed players who had previously played for Goorijan such as [[Jason Smith (Australian basketball)|Jason Smith]] and [[Bradley Sheridan]] followed him north to Sydney.\n\nHeal retired after the 2002\u201303 season, and [[C. J. Bruton]] was recruited to take his place, Jason Smith was signed after returning to the NBL after playing in Europe but unfortunately was injured 13 games into the season and was replaced by import [[Chris Carrawell]]. The Kings started the 2003\u201304 season with 10 successive wins, and would eventually win their second championship after their best-of-five grand final series with crosstown rivals [[Sydney Spirit|West Sydney Razorbacks]] went down to the deciding fifth game. Kings player [[Matthew Nielsen|Matt Nielsen]] would win the regular season and finals [[NBL (Australia) Most Valuable Player|MVP]] in 2003\u201304 before leaving to play overseas.\n\nThe Kings again performed strongly in the 2004\u201305 season despite a disastrous early game against Townsville which saw C. J. Bruton out for weeks with an elbow injury, and a season ending torn [[Anterior cruciate ligament|ACL]] for rookie of the year candidate [[Luke Kendall]]. The Kings managed without their starting backcourt until Bruton came back and they signed import big man Rolan Roberts. Arguably stronger than before the Kings finished on top of the ladder and crushed the [[Wollongong Hawks]] in three straight games to become the first team in Australian league history to win three consecutive championships. Jason Smith was named the NBL Finals Most Valuable Player.\n\nIn the 2005\u201306 season, the Kings again finished atop the ladder and made it to the grand final. Import centre Rolan Roberts suffered a torn pectoral muscle imitating a [[Vince Carter]] dunk during the All Star dunk competition and was replaced by [[Sedric Webber]]. In the finals they were swept 3-0 by the [[Chris Anstey]] led [[Melbourne Tigers]].\n\nThe club was then purchased in 2006 for $2 million by the chairman of fuel technology company [[Firepower International]], Tim Johnston.

He was linked with the [[Adelaide 36ers]], the [[Gold Coast Blaze]] and the Kings, whom Bogut had supported when growing up in Australia. Sydney was favored to secure his services and Bogut ultimately chose to make his NBL debut with the Kings. However, the insurance to cover his remaining US$39&nbsp;million contract with the Bucks couldn't be resolved, leaving the Kings and the NBL without the services of Australia's highest profile player. It was expected that Bogut's signing would see an increase in Kings membership and league attendances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/7066742/andrew-bogut-milwaukee-bucks-deal-australian-team-agent-says|title=Agent: Bogut's deal with Australian team is off|author=|date=|work=ESPN.go.com|access-date=21 February 2017}}</ref> Despite not being able to play, Bogut later expressed interest in joining the Kings' coaching staff during the lockout to help the club.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-sport/boguts-future-hinges-on-ankle-scans-20120316-1v9qc.html |title=Bogut's future hinges on ankle scans |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |author=Hand, Guy |date=16 March 2012 |agency=AAP |access-date=20 March 2012 }}</ref> This ultimately did not happen either.\n\nThe Kings fared better in 2011\u201312, finishing the season in seventh spot with an 11\u201317 record.\n\n=== 2012\u20132018: Continued struggles ===\nThe Kings continued to struggle over the ensuing six years, qualifying just once (2012\u201313) for the playoffs in their eight seasons since returning to the league, and finishing with a losing record in the regular season in each of their eight seasons. In November 2015, the club played their 800th game in franchise history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sydneykings.com/team-news/800-up-for-kings/|title=800 up for Kings \u2013 Official Website of the Sydney Kings|author=|date=6 November 2015|work=SydneyKings.com|access-date=21 February 2017}}</ref> Australian basketball icon [[Andrew Gaze]] was named head coach of the team on a three year deal starting with the 2016\u201317 season. The team recruited big names [[Kevin Lisch]], [[Brad Newley]] and [[Aleks Mari\u0107]] plus imports [[Greg Whittington]] and [[Michael Bryson]] for the 2016\u201317 season; however after starting the season with five wins in their opening six games, the Kings won just eight of their remaining 22 games and missed the playoffs.\n\nBefore the 2017\u201318 season, the team recruited imports [[Perry Ellis]] and [[Travis Leslie]] plus small forward [[Todd Blanchfield]]; however fared no better, losing 16 of their first 21 games as Lisch suffered a calf injury that would force him to miss most of the regular season. Late in the campaign the club brought in 2016\u201317 NBL MVP [[Jerome Randle]] and big man Jeremy Tyler. Randle led the team to six wins in their final seven games and was named to the All-NBL Second Team, but the Kings missed the playoffs for the fifth consecutive season.\n\n=== 2018\u2013present ===\nThe 2018\u201319 season will be the Kings' 30th anniversary season in the NBL. On 24 April 2018, the Kings announced the signing of Australian basketball icon, [[Andrew Bogut]]. In that same offseason, the Kings became the first beneficiary of the NBL's new \"Next Stars\" player development initiative, which offers a professional option immediately out of secondary school to Americans (who are currently barred from the NBA draft until one year after graduation), as well as Australians and New Zealanders considering U.S. college basketball. The team was assigned American [[Brian Bowen]], who was unable to play college basketball after being caught up in the sport's [[2017\u201318 NCAA Division I men's basketball corruption scandal|ongoing corruption scandal]] and signed a \"Next Stars\" contract with the league.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.sydneykings.com/news/article/38851-38851-2 |title=Sydney Kings unveil Next Star Brian Bowen |publisher=Sydney Kings |date=7 August 2018 |accessdate=7 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Home arena ==\nThe Sydney Kings' first home venue was the [[State Sports Centre]] located at [[Homebush, New South Wales|Homebush]]. After playing at the 5,006-seat venue in 1988 and 1989, the Kings then moved into Sydney's largest indoor venue, the 12,500-seat [[Sydney Entertainment Centre]] in 1990. The SEC, known for Kings games as \"The Kingdome\", would be the Kings' home until the team moved back to Homebush in 1999 and into the new, 18,200-capacity [[Sydney Super Dome]] which had been built as the main [[Basketball at the 2000 Summer Olympics|basketball]] and [[Gymnastics at the 2000 Summer Olympics|gymnastics]] venue for the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] held in Sydney.\n\nDespite attracting an NBL record 17,143 crowd for their opening-round game in the 1999/2000 season against the Canberra Cannons (played as a double header with the West Sydney Razorbacks playing the Brisbane Bullets), the Kings' time at the Super Dome only lasted three years. After the club went into voluntary administration following the 2001/2002 season and was then purchased by a new investment group, the franchise decided to move back to the Entertainment Centre in 2002, citing falling attendances and the high cost of playing their games at the NBA-size venue. It was also speculated at the time that the core of the Kings fan base came from the eastern and northern suburbs of Sydney and that fans were not enthused about having to travel to Homebush for games.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nThe Kings moved back to the Entertainment Centre in 2002, where they remained until 2015, though they were forced to move one game in the [[2012\u201313 NBL season]] to the State Sports Centre due to a pre-booked event taking priority at the Entertainment Centre. At its closing in 2015, the SEC had a basketball capacity of 10,517 (with curtains blocking off seats behind the basket to reduce capacity) giving the Kings the second-largest capacity venue in the NBL behind the 14,846-seat [[Perth Arena]], though as the SEC was opened in 1983 it also gave the Kings the league's oldest venue.\n\nThe Kings moved back to Homebush midway through the 2015\u201316 season due to the SEC being demolished to make way for an apartment complex and convention centre. On 13 March 2016, the Kings came under new management and were subsequently moved back to the Superdome (Qudos Bank Arena) for the 2016\u201317 season. During the regular season, the Kings curtained off the upper deck of the Qudos Bank Arena (depending on ticket demand), leaving capacity at approximately 9,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbl.com.au/featured-news/31131/|title=New ownership for Sydney Kings \u2013 NBL \u2013 The National Basketball League|author=|date=13 March 2016|work=NBL.com.au|access-date=21 February 2017}}</ref> In the final home game of the 2016\u201317 season, the Kings drew 11,005 fans to their game against Melbourne United \u2013 the second largest home crowd in franchise history.\n\n* [[State Sports Centre]] (1988\u20131989, 2012, 2016)\n* [[Sydney Entertainment Centre]] (1990\u20131999, 2002\u20132008, 2010\u20132015)\n* [[Sydney Super Dome]]  (1999\u20132002, 2016\u2013present)\n\n== Honour and awards ==\n{{columns-start|num=3}}\n;[[List of NBL champions|NBL champions]]\n* 2003, 2004, 2005\n\n;[[NBL Most Valuable Player Award|NBL Most Valuable Player]]\n* [[Chris Williams (basketball)|Chris Williams]] \u2013 2003\n* [[Matthew Nielsen]] \u2013 2004\n* [[Andrew Bogut]] \u2013 2019\n\n;[[NBL Grand Final Most Valuable Player Award|NBL Grand Final MVP]]\n* [[Chris Williams (basketball)|Chris Williams]] \u2013 2003\n* [[Matthew Nielsen]] \u2013 2004\n* [[Jason Smith (basketball, born 1974)|Jason Smith]] \u2013 2005\n\n;[[All-NBL Team|All-NBL First Team]]\n* [[Dwayne McClain]] \u2013 1992\n* Leon Trimmingham \u2013 1994\n* [[Shane Heal]] \u2013 2003\n* [[Chris Williams (basketball)|Chris Williams]] \u2013 2003\n* [[Matthew Nielsen]] \u2013 2004\n* [[Jason Smith (basketball, born 1974)|Jason Smith]] \u2013 2005\n* [[C.

If the vessel's integrity is compromised, the loss of pressure and dropping boiling point can cause the liquid to rapidly convert to gas and expand extremely rapidly. If the gas is then combustible as well, as is the case e.g. with hydrocarbons and alcohols, further damage can be caused by an ensuing fire.\n\n==Mechanism==\n{{more citations needed section|date=July 2013}}\nThere are three characteristics of liquids which are relevant to the discussion of a BLEVE:{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n# If a liquid in a sealed container is boiled, the pressure inside the container increases. As the liquid changes to a gas it expands - this expansion in a vented container would cause the gas and liquid to take up more space. In a sealed container the gas and liquid are not able to take up more space and so the pressure rises. Pressurized vessels containing liquids can reach an equilibrium where the liquid stops boiling and the pressure stops rising. This occurs when no more heat is being added to the system, either because it has reached ambient temperature, or because a steady-state equilibrium has been reached between the heat received from the heat source and the heat lost to the environment, or because it has had a heat source removed (in this latter case both the temperature and the pressure will fall if heat is allowed to leave the system).\n# The boiling temperature of a liquid is dependent on pressure - high pressures will yield high boiling temperatures, and low pressures will yield low boiling temperatures. A common simple experiment is to place a cup of water in a vacuum chamber, and then reduce the pressure in the chamber until the water boils. By reducing the pressure the water will boil even at room temperature. This works both ways - if the pressure is increased beyond normal atmospheric pressures, the boiling of hot water could be suppressed far beyond normal temperatures. The [[Radiator (engine cooling)|cooling system]] of a modern internal combustion engine is a common example.\n# When a liquid boils it turns into a gas. The resulting gas takes up far more space than the liquid did.\n\nTypically, a BLEVE starts with a container of liquid which is held above its normal, atmospheric-pressure boiling temperature. Many substances normally stored as liquids, such as [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]], [[propane]], and other similar [[industrial gas]]es have boiling temperatures, at atmospheric pressure, far below room temperature. In the case of water, a BLEVE could occur if a pressurized chamber of water is heated far beyond the standard {{convert|100|C|F}}. That container, because the boiling water pressurizes it, is capable of holding ''liquid'' water at very high temperatures.\n\nIf the pressurized vessel, containing liquid at high temperature (which may be room temperature, depending on the substance) ruptures, the pressure which prevents the liquid from boiling is lost. If the rupture is catastrophic, where the vessel is immediately incapable of holding any pressure at all, then there suddenly exists a large mass of liquid which is at very high temperature and very low pressure. This causes a portion of the liquid to \"instantaneously\" boil, which in turn causes an extremely rapid expansion. Depending on temperatures, pressures and the substance involved, that expansion may be so rapid that it can be classified as an explosion, fully capable of inflicting severe damage on its surroundings.\n\n===Water example===\n\nFor example, a tank of pressurized liquid water held at {{convert|204.4|C|F|sigfig=3}} might be pressurized to {{convert|1.7|MPa|psi|abbr=on}} above atmospheric (\"gauge\") pressure. If the tank containing the water were to rupture, there would for a brief moment exist a volume of liquid water which would be at:\n* atmospheric pressure\n* a temperature of {{convert|204.4|C|F|sigfig=3}}. \nAt atmospheric pressure the boiling point of water is {{convert|100|C|F}} - liquid water at atmospheric pressure does not exist at temperatures higher than {{convert|100|C|F}}. At that moment, the water would boil and turn to vapor explosively, and the {{convert|204.4|C|F|sigfig=3}} liquid water turned to gas would take up significantly more volume (\u22481,600-fold) than it did as liquid, causing a vapor explosion. Such explosions can happen when the superheated water of a [[Boiler]] escapes through a crack in a boiler, causing a [[boiler explosion]].\n\n===BLEVEs without chemical reactions===\n\nA BLEVE need not be a chemical explosion\u2014nor does there need to be a fire\u2014however if a flammable substance is subject to a BLEVE it may also be subject to intense heating, either from an external source of heat which may have caused the vessel to rupture in the first place or from an internal source of localized heating such as [[skin friction]]. This heating can cause a flammable substance to [[Combustion|ignite]], adding a secondary explosion caused by the primary BLEVE. While blast effects of any BLEVE can be devastating, a flammable substance such as propane can add significantly to the danger.\n\n[[File:Bleve explosion.svg|center|500px]]\nWhile the term BLEVE is most often used to describe the results of a container of flammable liquid rupturing due to fire, a BLEVE can occur even with a non-[[flammable]] substance such as water,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inspect-ny.com/plumbing/Water_Heater_Relief_Valves.htm |title=Temperature Pressure Relief Valves on Water Heaters: test, inspect, replace, repair guide |publisher=Inspect-ny.com |accessdate=12 July 2011}}</ref> [[liquid nitrogen]],<ref>[http://www.safteng.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1040:liquid-nitrogen-bleve-demo-vid-1 Liquid nitrogen BLEVE demo]</ref> [[liquid helium]] or other [[refrigerant]]s or [[cryogen]]s, and therefore is not usually considered a type of [[chemical explosive|chemical explosion]]. Note that in the case of liquefied gasses, BLEVEs can also be hazardous because of rapid cooling due to the absorption of the enthalpy of vaporization (e.g. frostbites), or because of possible asphyxiation if a large volume of gas is produced and not rapidly dispersed (e.g. inside a building, or in a trough in the case of heavier-than-air gasses), or because of the toxicity of the gasses produced.\n\n==Fires==\nBLEVEs can be caused by an external fire near the storage vessel causing heating of the contents and pressure build-up. While tanks are often designed to withstand great pressure, constant heating can cause the metal to weaken and eventually fail. If the tank is being heated in an area where there is no liquid, it may rupture faster without the liquid to absorb the heat. Gas containers are usually equipped with [[relief valve]]s that vent off excess pressure, but the tank can still fail if the pressure is not released quickly enough.<ref name=\"Kletz\" /> Relief valves are sized to release pressure fast enough to prevent the pressure from increasing beyond the strength of the vessel, but not so fast as to be the cause of an explosion. An appropriately sized relief valve will allow the liquid inside to boil slowly, maintaining a constant pressure in the vessel until all the liquid has boiled and the vessel empties.\n\nIf the substance involved is flammable, it is likely that the resulting cloud of the substance will ignite after the BLEVE has occurred, forming a fireball and possibly a [[fuel-air explosive|fuel-air explosion]], also termed a vapor cloud explosion (VCE). If the materials are [[toxicity|toxic]], a large area will be [[contaminated]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chemelab.ucsd.edu/processdesign/safety/safety-notes.pdf |title=Chemical Process Safety |format=PDF |accessdate=12 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720075455/http://chemelab.ucsd.edu/processdesign/safety/safety-notes.pdf |archivedate=20 July 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n==Incidents==\nThe term \"BLEVE\" was coined by three researchers at [[Factory Mutual]], in the analysis of an accident at one of their research facilities in 1957 involving a chemical reactor vessel.<ref>David F.

Depending on temperatures, pressures and the substance involved, that expansion may be so rapid that it can be classified as an explosion, fully capable of inflicting severe damage on its surroundings.\n\n===Water example===\n\nFor example, a tank of pressurized liquid water held at {{convert|204.4|C|F|sigfig=3}} might be pressurized to {{convert|1.7|MPa|psi|abbr=on}} above atmospheric (\"gauge\") pressure. If the tank containing the water were to rupture, there would for a brief moment exist a volume of liquid water which would be at:\n* atmospheric pressure\n* a temperature of {{convert|204.4|C|F|sigfig=3}}. \nAt atmospheric pressure the boiling point of water is {{convert|100|C|F}} - liquid water at atmospheric pressure does not exist at temperatures higher than {{convert|100|C|F}}. At that moment, the water would boil and turn to vapor explosively, and the {{convert|204.4|C|F|sigfig=3}} liquid water turned to gas would take up significantly more volume (\u22481,600-fold) than it did as liquid, causing a vapor explosion. Such explosions can happen when the superheated water of a [[Boiler]] escapes through a crack in a boiler, causing a [[boiler explosion]].\n\n===BLEVEs without chemical reactions===\n\nA BLEVE need not be a chemical explosion\u2014nor does there need to be a fire\u2014however if a flammable substance is subject to a BLEVE it may also be subject to intense heating, either from an external source of heat which may have caused the vessel to rupture in the first place or from an internal source of localized heating such as [[skin friction]]. This heating can cause a flammable substance to [[Combustion|ignite]], adding a secondary explosion caused by the primary BLEVE. While blast effects of any BLEVE can be devastating, a flammable substance such as propane can add significantly to the danger.\n\n[[File:Bleve explosion.svg|center|500px]]\nWhile the term BLEVE is most often used to describe the results of a container of flammable liquid rupturing due to fire, a BLEVE can occur even with a non-[[flammable]] substance such as water,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inspect-ny.com/plumbing/Water_Heater_Relief_Valves.htm |title=Temperature Pressure Relief Valves on Water Heaters: test, inspect, replace, repair guide |publisher=Inspect-ny.com |accessdate=12 July 2011}}</ref> [[liquid nitrogen]],<ref>[http://www.safteng.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1040:liquid-nitrogen-bleve-demo-vid-1 Liquid nitrogen BLEVE demo]</ref> [[liquid helium]] or other [[refrigerant]]s or [[cryogen]]s, and therefore is not usually considered a type of [[chemical explosive|chemical explosion]]. Note that in the case of liquefied gasses, BLEVEs can also be hazardous because of rapid cooling due to the absorption of the enthalpy of vaporization (e.g. frostbites), or because of possible asphyxiation if a large volume of gas is produced and not rapidly dispersed (e.g. inside a building, or in a trough in the case of heavier-than-air gasses), or because of the toxicity of the gasses produced.\n\n==Fires==\nBLEVEs can be caused by an external fire near the storage vessel causing heating of the contents and pressure build-up. While tanks are often designed to withstand great pressure, constant heating can cause the metal to weaken and eventually fail. If the tank is being heated in an area where there is no liquid, it may rupture faster without the liquid to absorb the heat. Gas containers are usually equipped with [[relief valve]]s that vent off excess pressure, but the tank can still fail if the pressure is not released quickly enough.<ref name=\"Kletz\" /> Relief valves are sized to release pressure fast enough to prevent the pressure from increasing beyond the strength of the vessel, but not so fast as to be the cause of an explosion. An appropriately sized relief valve will allow the liquid inside to boil slowly, maintaining a constant pressure in the vessel until all the liquid has boiled and the vessel empties.\n\nIf the substance involved is flammable, it is likely that the resulting cloud of the substance will ignite after the BLEVE has occurred, forming a fireball and possibly a [[fuel-air explosive|fuel-air explosion]], also termed a vapor cloud explosion (VCE). If the materials are [[toxicity|toxic]], a large area will be [[contaminated]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chemelab.ucsd.edu/processdesign/safety/safety-notes.pdf |title=Chemical Process Safety |format=PDF |accessdate=12 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720075455/http://chemelab.ucsd.edu/processdesign/safety/safety-notes.pdf |archivedate=20 July 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n==Incidents==\nThe term \"BLEVE\" was coined by three researchers at [[Factory Mutual]], in the analysis of an accident at one of their research facilities in 1957 involving a chemical reactor vessel.<ref>David F.

In 1980, with one leg having been amputated due to cancer, he embarked on an east to west cross-Canada run to raise money and awareness for cancer research. Although the spread of his cancer eventually forced him to end his quest after 143 days and {{convert|5373|km|mi}}, and ultimately cost him his life, his efforts resulted in a lasting, worldwide legacy. The annual [[Terry Fox Run]], first held in 1981, has grown to involve millions of participants in over 60 countries and is now the world's largest one-day fundraiser for cancer research; over [[Canadian dollar|C$]]750&nbsp;million has been raised in his name, as of January 2018.<ref name=\"Terry's Story\" />\n\nFox was a distance runner and [[basketball]] player for his [[Port Coquitlam]], [[British Columbia]], [[Terry Fox Secondary School|high school]] and [[Simon Fraser University]]. His right leg was amputated in 1977 after he was diagnosed with [[osteosarcoma]], though he continued to run using an artificial leg. He also played [[wheelchair basketball]] in [[Vancouver]], winning three national championships.\n\nIn 1980, he began the Marathon of Hope, a cross-country run to raise money for cancer research. He hoped to raise one dollar from each of Canada's 24&nbsp;million people. He began with little fanfare from [[St John's, Newfoundland and Labrador]], in April and ran the equivalent of a full [[marathon]] every day. Fox had become a national star by the time he reached [[Ontario]]; he made numerous public appearances with businessmen, athletes, and politicians in his efforts to raise money. He was forced to end his run outside [[Thunder Bay]] when the cancer spread to his lungs. His hopes of overcoming the disease and completing his marathon ended when he died nine months later.\n\nIn addition to being the youngest person ever named a Companion of the [[Order of Canada]], Fox won the 1980 [[Lou Marsh Award]] as the nation's top sportsman and was named [[Canadian Newsmaker of the Year|Canada's Newsmaker of the Year]] in both 1980 and 1981. Considered a national hero, he has had many buildings, statues, roads, and parks named in his honour across the country.\n\n==Early life and cancer==\nTerry Fox was born on July 28, 1958, in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], to Rolland and [[Betty Fox]].

In 1980, with one leg having been amputated due to cancer, he embarked on an east to west cross-Canada run to raise money and awareness for cancer research. Although the spread of his cancer eventually forced him to end his quest after 143 days and {{convert|5373|km|mi}}, and ultimately cost him his life, his efforts resulted in a lasting, worldwide legacy. The annual [[Terry Fox Run]], first held in 1981, has grown to involve millions of participants in over 60 countries and is now the world's largest one-day fundraiser for cancer research; over [[Canadian dollar|C$]]750&nbsp;million has been raised in his name, as of January 2018.<ref name=\"Terry's Story\" />\n\nFox was a distance runner and [[basketball]] player for his [[Port Coquitlam]], [[British Columbia]], [[Terry Fox Secondary School|high school]] and [[Simon Fraser University]]. His right leg was amputated in 1977 after he was diagnosed with [[osteosarcoma]], though he continued to run using an artificial leg. He also played [[wheelchair basketball]] in [[Vancouver]], winning three national championships.\n\nIn 1980, he began the Marathon of Hope, a cross-country run to raise money for cancer research. He hoped to raise one dollar from each of Canada's 24&nbsp;million people. He began with little fanfare from [[St John's, Newfoundland and Labrador]], in April and ran the equivalent of a full [[marathon]] every day. Fox had become a national star by the time he reached [[Ontario]]; he made numerous public appearances with businessmen, athletes, and politicians in his efforts to raise money. He was forced to end his run outside [[Thunder Bay]] when the cancer spread to his lungs. His hopes of overcoming the disease and completing his marathon ended when he died nine months later.\n\nIn addition to being the youngest person ever named a Companion of the [[Order of Canada]], Fox won the 1980 [[Lou Marsh Award]] as the nation's top sportsman and was named [[Canadian Newsmaker of the Year|Canada's Newsmaker of the Year]] in both 1980 and 1981. Considered a national hero, he has had many buildings, statues, roads, and parks named in his honour across the country.\n\n==Early life and cancer==\nTerry Fox was born on July 28, 1958, in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], to Rolland and [[Betty Fox]]. Rolland was a switchman for the [[Canadian National Railway]].<ref name=\"MtlGazette42880\">{{cite news|last=Scrivener|first=Leslie|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kBQyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=aaQFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1162,4206618|title=Terry's running for the cancer society|newspaper=Montreal Gazette|date=April 28, 1980|accessdate=February 25, 2010|page=21}}</ref> Fox had an elder brother, Fred, a younger brother, Darrell, and a younger sister, Judith.<ref name=\"Greatest Canadian\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/greatest/top_ten/nominee/fox-terry.html|title=The Greatest Canadian: Terry Fox|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=February 25, 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704121456/http://www.cbc.ca/greatest/top_ten/nominee/fox-terry.html|archivedate=July 4, 2008}}</ref> Fox's maternal grandmother is [[M\u00e9tis]] and Fox's younger brother Darrell has official M\u00e9tis status.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bailey|first1=Ian|title=A marathon of genealogy|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/terry-fox-was-metis-fox-family-explores-and-claims-metisheritage/article37517004/|accessdate=January 7, 2018|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=January 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\nHis family moved to [[Surrey, British Columbia]], in 1966, then settled in [[Port Coquitlam]], in 1968.<ref name=\"Greatest Canadian\"/> His parents were dedicated to their family, and his mother was especially protective of her children; it was through her that Fox developed his stubborn dedication to whatever task he committed to do.<ref name=\"Scrivener13\">Scrivener, 2000, pp. 13\u201314.</ref> His father recalled that he was extremely competitive, noting that Fox hated to lose so much that he would continue at any activity until he succeeded.<ref name=\"Inwood\">{{cite news|first=Damian|last=Inwood|title=Terry Fox: 25 years; Celebrating his dream: a 12-page special section honouring the 25th Annual Terry Fox Run|newspaper=Vancouver Province |date=September 18, 2005}}</ref>\n\nHe was an enthusiastic athlete, playing [[association football|soccer]], [[rugby football|rugby]] and [[baseball]] as a child.<ref name=\"Scrivener16\">Scrivener, 2000, pp. 16\u201317.</ref> His passion was for [[basketball]] and though he stood only five feet tall and was a poor player at the time, Fox sought to make his school team in grade eight.

There were faces with the brave smiles, and the ones who had given up smiling. There were feelings of hopeful denial, and the feelings of despair. My quest would not be a selfish one. I could not leave knowing these faces and feelings would still exist, even though I would be set free from mine.

The people in cancer clinics all over the world need people who believe in miracles. I am not a dreamer, and I am not saying that this will initiate any kind of definitive answer or cure to cancer. I believe in miracles. I have to.\"<ref name=cosentino/> The Cancer Society was skeptical of his dedication, but agreed to support Fox once he had acquired sponsors and requested he get a medical certificate from a heart specialist stating that he was fit to attempt the run. Fox was diagnosed with [[left ventricular hypertrophy]]&nbsp;\u2013 an enlarged heart&nbsp;\u2013 a condition commonly associated with athletes. Doctors warned Fox of the potential risks he faced, though they did not consider his condition a significant concern. They endorsed his participation when he promised that he would stop immediately if he began to experience any heart problems.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, pp. 69\u201370.</ref>\n\nA second letter was sent to several corporations seeking donations for a vehicle and running shoes, and to cover the other costs of the run.<ref name=\"Scrivener63\">Scrivener, 2000, p. 63.</ref> Fox sent other letters asking for grants to buy a running leg.
