It concerns the ethical, legal and social impact of neuroscience, including the ways in which neurotechnology can be used to predict or alter human behavior and \"the implications of our mechanistic understanding of brain function for society... integrating neuroscientific knowledge with ethical and social thought\".\n\nSome neuroethics problems are not fundamentally different from those encountered in [[bioethics]]. Others are unique to neuroethics because the brain, as the organ of the mind, has implications for broader philosophical problems, such as the nature of [[free will]], [[moral responsibility]], [[self-deception]], and [[personal identity]].<ref>Farah Martha J., Neuroethics: An Introduction with Readings, 2010</ref> Examples of neuroethics topics are given later in this article (\"[[#Key issues|Key issues in neuroethics]]\").\n\nThe origin of the term \"neuroethics\" has occupied some writers. Rees and Rose (as cited in \"References\" on page 9){{Inconsistent}} claim ''neuroethics'' is a [[neologism]] that emerged only at the beginning of the 21st century, largely through the [[Speech communication|oral]] and [[Writing|written]] [[communication]]s of [[ethicist]]s and [[philosopher]]s.  According to Racine (2010), the term was coined by the Harvard physician Anneliese A. Pontius in 1973 in a paper entitled \"Neuro-ethics of 'walking' in the newborn\" for the ''Perceptual and Motor Skills''. The author reproposed the term in 1993 in her paper for ''Psychological Report'', often wrongly mentioned as the first title containing the word \"neuroethics\". Before 1993, the American neurologist Ronald Cranford has used the term (see Cranford 1989).  Illes (2003) records uses, from the scientific literature, from 1989 and 1991.  Writer [[William Safire]] is widely credited with giving the word its current meaning in 2002, defining it as \"the examination of what is right and wrong, good and bad about the treatment of, perfection of, or unwelcome invasion of and worrisome manipulation of the human brain\".<ref>Safire, W. Visions for a New Field of \"Neuroethics\" Neuroethics Mapping the Field Conference Proceedings. May 13\u201314, 2002. San Francisco, California</ref>\n\n==Two categories of problems==\nNeuroethics encompasses the myriad ways in which developments in basic and clinical neuroscience intersect with social and ethical issues. The field is so young that any attempt to define its scope and limits now will undoubtedly be proved wrong in the future, as [[neuroscience]] develops and its implications continue to be revealed. At present, however, we can discern two general categories of neuroethical issue: those emerging from what we can do and those emerging from what we know.\n\nIn the first category are the ethical problems raised by advances in functional [[neuroimaging]], [[psychopharmacology]], [[brain implants]] and [[Cyborg|brain-machine interfaces]]. In the second category are the ethical problems raised by our growing understanding of the neural bases of behavior, personality, consciousness, and states of spiritual transcendence.\n\n==Historical background and implications of neuroscience ethics==\n[[Primitive culture|Primitive]] societies for the most part lacked a system of neuroethics to guide them in facing the problems of mental illness and violence as civilization advanced.

The Soviet [[psychiatrists]] and Nazi doctor's dark descent into barbarism was a product of [[physicians]] willingly cooperating with the [[totalitarian state]], purportedly in the name of the \"[[Common good|collective good]]\", at the expense of their individual patients.\" This must be kept in mind when establishing new guidelines in neuroscience research and bioethics.<ref name=\"Faria 3\" />\n\n==Important activity since 2002 ==\nThere is no doubt that people were thinking and writing about the ethical implications of [[neuroscience]] for many years before the field adopted the label \"neuroethics\", and some of this work remains of great relevance and value.  However, the early 21st century saw a tremendous surge in interest concerning the ethics of [[neuroscience]], as evidenced by numerous meetings, publications and organizations dedicated to this topic.\n\nIn 2002, there were several meetings that drew together neuroscientists and ethicists to discuss neuroethics:  the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] with the journal ''[[Neuron (journal)|Neuron]]'', the [[University of Pennsylvania]], the [[Royal Society]], [[Stanford University]], and the [[Dana Foundation]].  This last meeting was the largest, and resulted in a book, ''Neuroethics: Mapping the Field'', edited by Steven J. Marcus and published by Dana Press.   That same year, the ''Economist'' ran a cover story entitled \"Open Your Mind: The Ethics of Brain Science\", ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' published the article \"Emerging ethical issues in neuroscience\".<ref>{{cite journal | author = Farah Martha J | year = 2002 | title = Emerging ethical issues in neuroscience | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 5 | issue = 11| pages = 1123\u2013129 | doi=10.1038/nn1102-1123| pmid = 12404006 | url = https://repository.upenn.edu/neuroethics_pubs/13 }}</ref> Further articles appeared on neuroethics in ''[[Nature Neuroscience]]'', ''Neuron'', and ''[[Brain and Cognition]]''.\n\nThereafter, the number of neuroethics meetings, symposia and publications continued to grow.  The over 38 000 members of the [[Society for Neuroscience]] recognized the importance of neuroethics by inaugurating an annual \"special lecture\" on the topic, first given by [[Donald Kennedy]], editor-in-chief of Science Magazine.  Several overlapping networks of scientists and scholars began to coalesce around neuroethics-related projects and themes.  For example, the American Society for Bioethics and Humanities established a Neuroethics Affinity Group, students at the [[London School of Economics]] established the Neuroscience and Society Network linking scholars from several different institutions, and a group of scientists and funders from around the world began discussing ways to support international collaboration in neuroethics through what came to be called the International Neuroethics Network.  Stanford began publishing the monthly Stanford Neuroethics Newsletter, Penn developed the informational website neuroethics.upenn.edu, and the Neuroethics and Law Blog was launched.\n\nSeveral relevant books were published during this time as well: Sandra Ackerman's ''Hard Science, Hard Choices: Facts, Ethics and Policies Guiding Brain Science Today'' (Dana Press), Michael Gazzaniga's ''The Ethical Brain'' (Dana Press), Judy Illes' edited volume, ''Neuroethics: Defining the Issues in Theory, Practice and Policy'' (both Oxford University Press), [[Dai Rees (scientist)|Dai Rees]] and Steven Rose's edited volume ''The New Brain Sciences: Perils and Prospects'' (Cambridge University Press) and Steven Rose's ''The Future of the Brain'' (Oxford University Press).\n\n2006 marked the founding of the [[International Neuroethics Society|International Neuroethics Society (INS)]] (originally the Neuroethics Society), an international group of scholars, scientists, clinicians, and other professionals who share an interest in the social, legal, ethical and policy implications of advances in neuroscience. The mission of the International Neuroethics Society \"is to promote the development and responsible application of neuroscience through interdisciplinary and international research, education, outreach and public engagement for the benefit of people of all nations, ethnicities, and cultures\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Neurogaming: What's Neuroscience and Ethics Got To Do With It?|url=http://www.ethicscenter.net/Neurogaming-November2013|website=The Center for Ethics in Science and Technology|accessdate=28 September 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809044403/http://www.ethicscenter.net/Neurogaming-November2013|archivedate=9 August 2014}}</ref> The first President of the INS was Steven Hyman (2006\u20132014),  succeeded by [[Barbara Sahakian]] (2014\u20132016).

For example, readings and websites that focus on specific aspects of neuroethics, such as brain imaging or enhancement, are not included.  Nor are more recent sources, such as Walter Glannon's book ''Bioethics and the Brain'' (Oxford University Press) and his reader, entitled Defining Right and Wrong in Brain Science (Dana Press).  We should also here mention a book that was in many ways ahead of its time, Robert Blank's Brain Policy (published in 1999 by Georgetown University Press).  The scholarly literature on neuroethics has grown so quickly that one cannot easily list all of the worthwhile articles, and several journals are now soliciting neuroethics submissions for publication, including the ''American Journal of Bioethics \u2013 Neuroscience'', ''BioSocieties'', the ''Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience'', and ''Neuroethics''.  The web now has many sites, blogs and portals offering information about neuroethics.  A list can be found at the end of this entry.\n\n==Key issues==\nNeuroethics encompasses a wide range of issues, which can only be sampled here.<ref name=\"LeefmannLevallois2016\">{{cite journal|last1=Leefmann|first1=Jon|last2=Levallois|first2=Clement|last3=Hildt|first3=Elisabeth|title=Neuroethics 1995\u20132012.

For example, how should incidental findings be handled when a presumed healthy research subject is scanned for neuroscience research and the scan reveals an abnormality?  How safe are the drugs used to enhance normal brain function?  These are neuroethical issues with clear precedents in traditional bioethics.  They are important issues, and luckily we can call upon society's experience with the relevant precedents to help determine the best courses of action in the present cases.  In contrast, many neuroethical issues are at least partly novel, and this accounts for some of the intellectual fascination of neuroethics.  These relatively newer issues force us to think about the relation between mind and brain and its ethical implications.\n\n===Brain interventions===\nThe ethics of neurocognitive enhancement, that is the use of drugs and other brain interventions to make normal people \"better than well\", is an example of a neuroethical issue with both familiar and novel aspects.  On the one hand, we can be informed by previous bioethical work on physical enhancements such as [[Doping in sport|doping for strength in sports]] and the use of [[Growth hormone treatment|human growth hormone for normal boys of short stature]].  On the other hand, there are also some arguably novel ethical issues that arise in connection with brain enhancement, because these enhancements affect how people think and feel, thus raising the relatively new issues of \"[[cognitive liberty]]\".  The growing role of [[psychopharmacology]] in everyday life raises a number of ethical issues, for example the influence of drug marketing on our conceptions of mental health and [[Normality (behavior)|normalcy]], and the increasingly malleable sense of [[personal identity]] that results from what [[Peter D. Kramer]] called \"cosmetic psychopharmacology\".\n\nNonpharmacologic methods of altering brain function are currently enjoying a period of rapid development, with a resurgence of [[psychosurgery]] for the treatment of medication refractory mental illnesses and promising new therapies for neurological and psychiatric illnesses based on [[deep brain stimulation]] as well as relatively noninvasive [[transcranial stimulation (disambiguation)|transcranial stimulation]] methods.  Research on brain-machine interfaces is primarily in a preclinical phase but promises to enable thought-based control of computers and robots by paralyzed patients.  As the tragic history of [[frontal lobotomy]] reminds us, permanent alteration of the brain cannot be undertaken lightly.  Although nonpharmacologic brain interventions are exclusively aimed at therapeutic goals, the US military sponsors research in this general area (and more specifically in the use of [[transcranial direct current stimulation]]) that is presumably aimed at enhancing the capabilities of soldiers.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Neurostimulation Devices for Cognitive Enhancement: Toward a Comprehensive Regulatory Framework|date=1 August 2015|journal=Neuroethics|volume=8|issue=2|pages=115\u2013126|author=Dubljevic, V.|doi=10.1007/s12152-014-9225-0}}</ref>\n\n===Brain imaging===\nIn addition to the important issues of safety and incidental findings, mentioned above, some arise from the unprecedented and rapidly developing ability to correlate brain activation with psychological states and traits. One of the most widely discussed new applications of imaging is based on correlations between brain activity and [[Lie|intentional deception]]. Intentional deception can be thought of in the context of a [[Polygraph|lie detector]]. This means that scientists use brain imaging to look at certain parts of the brain during moments when a person is being deceptive. A number of different research groups have identified [[fMRI]] correlates of intentional deception in laboratory tasks, and despite the skepticism of many experts, the technique has already been commercialized.  A more feasible application of brain imaging is \"[[neuromarketing]]\", whereby people's conscious or unconscious reaction to certain products can purportedly be measured.\n\nResearchers are also finding brain imaging correlates of myriad psychological traits, including personality, intelligence, mental health vulnerabilities, attitudes toward particular ethnic groups, and predilection for violent crime.  Unconscious racial attitudes may be manifest in brain activation.  These capabilities of brain imaging, actual and potential, raise a number of ethical issues.  The most obvious concern involves [[privacy]].  For example, employers, marketers, and the government all have a strong interest in knowing the abilities, personality, truthfulness and other mental contents of certain people.  This raises the question of whether, when, and how to ensure the [[Privacy laws of the United States#Intrusion of solitude and seclusion|privacy of our own minds]].\n\nAnother ethical problem is that brain scans are often viewed as more accurate and objective than in fact they are.  Many layers of signal processing, statistical analysis and interpretation separate imaged brain activity from the psychological traits and states inferred from it.  There is a danger that the public (including judges and juries, employers, insurers, etc.) will ignore these complexities and treat brain images as a kind of indisputable truth.\n\nA related misconception is called neuro-realism:  In its simplest form, this line of thought says that something is real because it can be measured with electronic equipment.  A person who claims to have pain, or low libido, or unpleasant emotions is \"really\" sick if these symptoms are supported by a brain scan, and healthy or normal if correlates cannot be found in a brain scan.<ref name=Gordijn>{{cite book \n |author1=Gordijn Bert |author2=Giordano James J. | title=Scientific and Philosophical Perspectives in Neuroethics \n | publisher=Cambridge University Press \n | location=Cambridge, UK \n | year=2010 \n | pages=256\u2013262\n | isbn=978-0-521-70303-1 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news \n | title=Lost your libido?

Propranolol, an FDA-approved drug, has been suggested to effectively dull the painful effects of traumatic memories if taken within 6 hours after the event occurs.<ref>''Elsey, J. J. W. B.

However, doctors are permitted to use the drug for off-label purposes\u2014leading to the question of whether they actually ''should''. There are numerous reasons for skepticism; for one, it may prevent us from coming to terms with traumatic experiences, it may tamper with our identities and lead us to an artificial sense of happiness, demean the genuineness of human life, and/or encourage some to forget memories they are morally obligated to keep. Whether or not it is ethical to fully or partially erase the memory of a patient, it is certainly becoming a more relevant topic as this technology improves in our society.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Farah|first1=Martha|title=Neuroethics: an introduction withreadings|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press|isbn=9780262062695|pages=97\u20138}}</ref>\n\n===Stem cell therapy===\n\nMost of the issues concerning uses of [[stem cell]]s in the brain are the same as any of the bioethical or purely ethical questions you will find regarding the use and research of stem cells. The field of stem cell research is a very new field which poses many ethical questions concerning the allocation of stem cells as well as their possible uses.  Since most stem cell research is still in its preliminary phase most of the neuroethical issues surrounding stem cells are the same as [[Stem cell controversy|stem cell ethics]] in general.\n\nMore specifically the way that stem cell research has been involved in neuroscience is through the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and brain tumors. In these cases scientists are using [[neural stem cell]]s to regenerate tissue and to be used as carriers for [[gene therapy]]. In general, neuroethics revolves around a cost benefit approach to find techniques and technologies that are most beneficial to patients. There has been progress in certain fields that have been shown to be beneficial when using stem cells to treat certain neurodegenerative diseases such as [[Parkinson's disease]].<ref>{{Cite journal |pmid = 21371482|pmc = 3087494|year = 2011|last1 = Vaccarino|first1 = F.

The cells can be used to study the progression of Parkinson's as well as used in regenerative treatment. Animal studies have shown that the use of iPSCs can improve motor skills and dopamine release of test subjects with Parkinson's. This study shows a positive outcome in the use of stem cells for neurological purposes.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=L W|author2=F Kuang |author3=L C Wei |author4=Y X Ding |author5=K K L Yung |author6=Y S Chan |title=Potential application of induced pluripotent stem cells in cell replacement therapy for Parkinson's disease|journal=CNS & Neurological Disorders Drug Targets|date=Jun 2011|volume=10|issue=4|pages=449\u2013458|pmid=21495962|doi=10.2174/187152711795563994}}</ref>\n\nIn another study done in 2011 used stem cells to treat [[cerebral palsy]]. This study, however, was not as successful as the Parkinson's treatment. In this case stem cells were used to treat animal models who had been injured in a way that mimicked CP. This brings up a neuroethical issue of animal models used in science. Since most of their \"diseases\" are inflicted and do not occur naturally, they can not always be reliable examples of how a person with the actual disease would respond to treatment. The stem cells used did survive implantation, but did not show significant nerve regeneration. However, studies are ongoing in this area.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bell|first=Emily|author2=Isabelle Chouinard |author3=Michael Shevell |author4=Eric Racine |title=Responding to requests of families for unproven interventions in neurodevelopmental disorders: hyperbaric oxygen \"treatment\" and stem cell \"therapy\" in cerebral palsy.|journal=Developmental Disabilities Research Reviews|year=2011|volume=17|issue=1|pages=19\u201326|doi=10.1002/ddrr.134|pmid=22447751}}</ref>\n\nAs discussed, stem cells are used to treat degenerative diseases. One form of a degenerative disease that can occur in the brain as well as throughout the body is an [[autoimmune disease]]. Autoimmune diseases cause the body to \"attack\" its own cells and therefore destroys those cells as well as whatever functional purpose those cells have or contribute to. One form of an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system is [[multiple sclerosis]]. In this disease the body attacks the [[glial cells]] that form myelin coats around the axons on neurons. This causes the nervous system to essentially \"short circuit\" and pass information very slowly. Stem cells therapy has been used to try to cure some of the damage caused by the body in MS. [[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation]] has been used to try and cure MS patients by essentially \"reprogramming\" their immune system. The main risk encountered with this form of treatment is the possibility of rejection of the stem cells. If the hematopoetic stem cells can be harvested from the individual, risk of rejection is much lower. But, there can be the risk of those cells being programmed to induce MS. However, if the tissue is donated from another individual there is high risk of rejection leading to possibly fatal toxicity in the recipient's body. Considering that there are fairly good treatments for MS, the use of stem cells in this case may have a higher cost than the benefits they produce. However, as research continues perhaps stem cells will truly become a viable treatment for MS as well as other autoimmune diseases.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Silani|first=Vincenzo|author2=Lidia Cova|title=Stem cell transplantation in Multiple Sclerosis: Safety and Ethics|journal=Journal of the Neurological Sciences|date=15 February 2008|volume=265|issue=1\u20132|pages=116\u2013121|doi=10.1016/j.jns.2007.06.010|pmid=17619025}}</ref>\n\nThese are just some examples of neurological diseases in which stem cell treatment has been researched. In general, the future looks promising for stem cell application in the field of neurology. However, possible complications lie in the overall ethics of stem cell use, possible recipient rejection, as well as over-proliferation of the cells causing possible brain tumors. Ongoing research will further contribute in the decision of whether stem cells should be used in the brain and whether their benefits truly outweigh their costs.\n\nThe primary ethical dilemma that is brought up in stem cell research is concerning the source of [[embryonic stem cells]] (hESCs). As the name states, hESCs come from embryos. To be more specific, they come from the [[inner cell mass]] of a blastophere, which is the beginning stage of an embryo. However, that mass of cells could have the potential to give rise to human life, and there in lies the problem. Often, this argument leads back to a similar moral debate held around abortion. The question is: when does a mass of cells gain personhood and autonomy?<ref>{{cite journal|last=Barker|first=Roger A|author2=Inez de Beaufort|title=Scientific and ethical issues related to stem cell research and interventions in neurodegenerative disorders of the brain|journal=Progress in Neurobiology|date=November 2013|volume=110|pages=63\u201373|doi=10.1016/j.pneurobio.2013.04.003|pmid=23665410}}</ref> Some individuals believe that an embryo is in fact a person at the moment of conception and that using an embryo for anything other than creating a baby would essentially be killing a baby. On the other end of the spectrum, people argue that the small ball of cells at that point only has the potential to become a fetus, and that potentiality, even in natural conception, is far from guaranteed. According to a study done by developmental biologists, between 75\u201380% of embryos created through intercourse are naturally lost before they can become fetuses.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hyun|first=Insoo|title=The bioethics of stem cell research and therapy|journal=The Journal of Clinical Investigation|date=4 January 2010|volume=120|issue=1|pages=71\u201375|doi=10.1172/jci40435|pmid=20051638|pmc=2798696}}</ref> This debate is not one that has a right or wrong answer, nor can it be clearly settled.  Much of the ethical dilemma surrounding hESCs relies on individual beliefs about life and the potential for scientific advancement versus creating new human life.\n\n=== Disorders of consciousness ===\n\nPatients in coma, vegetative, or minimally conscious state pose ethical challenges. The patients are unable to respond, therefore the assessment of their needs can only be approached by adopting a third person perspective. They are unable to communicate their pain levels, quality of life, or end of life preferences. Neuroscience and brain imaging have allowed us to explore the brain activity of these patients more thoroughly. Recent findings from studies using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] have changed the way we view vegetative patients. The images have shown that aspects emotional processing, language comprehension and even conscious awareness might be retained in patients whose behavior suggests a vegetative state. If this is the case, it is unethical to allow a third party to dictate the life and future of the patient.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bruno|first=Marie-Aur\u00e9lie|author2=Steven Laureys|title=Coma and disorders of consciousness|journal=Handbook of Clinical Neurology|year=2013|volume=118|pages=205\u2013213|doi=10.1016/b978-0-444-53501-6.00017-2|pmid=24182379|isbn=9780444535016}}</ref>  For example, defining death is an issue that comes with patients with severe traumatic brain injuries. The decision to withdraw life-sustaining care from these patients can be based on uncertain assessments about the individual's conscious awareness. Case reports have shown that these patients in a persistent vegetative state can recover unexpectedly. This raises the ethical question about the premature termination of care by physicians. The hope is that one day, neuroimaging technologies can help us to define these different states of consciousness and enable us to communicate with patients in vegetative states in a way that was never before possible.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Catherine|first=Rodrigue|title=Perspectives and Experience of Healthcare Professionals on Diagnosis, Prognosis, and End-of-Life Decision Making in Patients with Disorders of Consciousness|journal=Neuroethics|date=2013-04-01|volume=6|issue=1|pages=25\u201336|doi=10.1007/s12152-011-9142-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Fins|first=Joseph J.|title=Neuroethics, Neuroimaging, and Disorders of Consciousness: Promise or Peril?|journal=Transactions of the American Clinical and Climatological Association|year=2011|volume=122|pages=336\u2013346|pmc=3116331|pmid=21686236}}</ref> The clinical translation of these advanced technologies is of vital importance for the medical management of these challenging patients.

Some case reports with the antidepressant [[Prozac]] indicated that patients seemed \"better than well\", and authors hypothesized that this effect might be observed in individuals not afflicted with psychiatric disorders. Following these case reports much controversy arose over the veracity and ethics of the cosmetic use of these antidepressants.  Opponents of [[cosmetic pharmacology]] believe that such drug usage is unethical and that the concept of cosmetic pharmacology is a manifestation of naive consumerism. Proponents, such as philosopher [[Arthur Caplan]], state that it is an individual's (rather than government's, or physician's) right to determine  whether to use a drug for cosmetic purposes.<ref>Caplan, Arthur.  Is Better Best?  A Noted Ethicist Argues in Favor of Brain Enhancement.  Scientific American.  September, 2003.  Pages 04-05</ref> [[Anjan Chatterjee]], a neurologist at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], has argued that western medicine stands on the brink of a neuro-enhancement revolution in which people will be able to improve their memory and attention through pharmacological means.  Jacob Appel, a Brown University bioethicist, has raised concerns about the possibility of employers mandating such enhancement for their workers.<ref>J M Appel  When the boss turns pusher: a proposal for employee protections in the age of cosmetic neurology  J Med Ethics 2008; 34: 616-618</ref><ref>Jason Kirby.

This has already been happening within the elections throughout the years. In the 2006 reelection of Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], he was double digits off in the voting in comparison to his Democratic opponent. However, Schwarzenegger's theme in this campaign was whether or not the voters would want to continue Schwarzenegger's reforms or go back to the days of the recalled governor, [[Gray Davis]]. In normal marketing, voters would use \"detail, numbers, facts and figures to prove we were better off under the new governor\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.campaignsandelections.com/magazine/2306/the-power-of-neuromarketing|title=The power of neuromarketing}}</ref> However, with neuromarketing, voters followed powerful advertisement visuals and used these visuals to convince themselves that Schwarzenegger was the better candidate. Now, with political neuromarketing, there exists a lot of controversy. The ethics behind political neuromarketing are debatable. Some argue that political neuromarketing will cause voters to make rash decisions while others argue that these messages are beneficial because they depict what the politicians can do. However, control over political decisions could make voters not see the reality of things. Voters may not look into the details of the reforms, personality, and morality each person brings to their political campaign and may be swayed by how powerful the advertisements seem to be. However, there are also people that may disagree with this idea. Darryl Howard, \"a consultant to two Republican winners on November 2, says he crafted neuromarketing-based messages for TV, direct mail and speeches for Senate, Congressional and [[Governor (United States)|Gubernatorial]] clients in 2010\". He says that these advertisements that were presented, show honesty and continues to say how he and other politicians decide which advertisements are the most effective.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.upperplayground.com/tag/darryl-howard|title=Upper Playground - darryl-howard|website=news.upperplayground.com}}</ref>\n\n===Neurological treatments ===\n\nNeuroscience has led to a deeper understanding of the chemical imbalances present in a disordered brain. In turn, this has resulted in the creation of new treatments and medications to treat these disorders. When these new [[Clinical trial|treatments are first being tested]], the experiments prompt ethical questions. First, because the treatment is affecting the brain, the side effects can be unique and sometimes severe. A special kind of side effect that many subjects have claimed to experience in neurological treatment tests is changes in \"[[personal identity]]\". Although this is a difficult ethical dilemma because there are no clear and undisputed definitions of personality, self, and identity, neurological treatments can result in patients losing parts of \"themselves\" such as memories or moods. Yet another ethical dispute in neurological treatment research is the [[Triage|choice of patients]]. From a perspective of justice, priority should be given to those who are most seriously impaired and who will benefit most from the intervention. However, in a test group, scientists must select patients to secure a favorable risk-benefit ratio. Setting priority becomes more difficult when a patient's chance to benefit and the seriousness of their impairment do not go together. For example, many times an older patient will be excluded despite the seriousness of their disorder simply because they are not as strong or as likely to benefit from the treatment.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mohamed|first=Ahmed D.|author2=Barbara J. Sahakian|title=The ethics of elective psychopharmacology|journal=The International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology|year=2012|volume=15|issue=4|pages=559\u2013571|doi=10.1017/s146114571100037x|pmid=21396152|pmc=3325502}}</ref> The main ethical issue at the heart of neurological treatment research on human subjects is promoting high-quality scientific research in the interest of future patients, while at the same time respecting and guarding the rights and interests of the research subjects. This is particularly difficult in the field of [[neurology]] because damage to the brain is often permanent and will change a patient's way of life forever.\n\n===Neuroscience and free will===\n{{Also|Neuroscience of free will}}\n\nNeuroethics also encompasses the ethical issues raised by neuroscience as it affects our understanding of the world and of ourselves in the world.  For example, if everything we do is physically caused by our brains, which are in turn a product of our genes and our life experiences, how can we be held responsible for our actions?  A [[crime]] in the United States requires a \"[[Actus reus|guilty act]]\" and a \"[[Mens rea|guilty mind]]\". As [[neuropsychiatry]] evaluations have become more commonly used in the criminal justice system and [[neuroimaging]] technologies have given us a more direct way of viewing brain injuries, scholars have cautioned that this could lead to the inability to hold anyone criminally responsible for their actions. In this way, neuroimaging evidence could suggest that there is no free will and each action a person makes is simply the product of past actions and biological impulses that are out of our control.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Neuroscience, Neuropolitics and Neuroethics: The Complex Case of Crime, Deception and fMRI - Springer|journal=Neuroscience, Neuropolitics and Neuroethics| doi=10.1007/s11948-012-9393-4|pmid=23054671|volume=18|issue=3|pages=573\u2013591|year=2012|last1=Henry|first1=Stuart|last2=Plemmons|first2=Dena}}</ref>  The question of whether and how personal [[autonomy]] is compatible with neuroscience ethics and the responsibility of neuroscientists to society and the state is a central one for neuroethics.<ref name=\"Aggarwal 2013\"/> However, there is some controversy over whether autonomy entails the concept of 'free will' or is a 'moral-political' principle separate from metaphysical quandaries.<ref>Dubljevic, V. 2013: Autonomy in Neuroethics: Political and not metaphysical, AJOB-Neuroscience 4(4):44-51 https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21507740.2013.819390</ref>\nIn late 2013 U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] made recommendations to the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues as part of his $100 million Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative.

[[Miguel Faria]], a Professor of Neurosurgery and an Associate Editor in Chief of [[Surgical Neurology International]], who was not involved in the Commission's work said, \"any ethics approach must be based upon respect for the individual, as doctors pledge according to the [[Hippocratic Oath]] which includes vows to be humble, respect privacy and doing no harm; and pursuing a path based on population-based ethics is just as dangerous as having no medical ethics at all\".<ref name=\"Faria Hacienda\">{{cite web|author1=Faria, Miguel A  |author2=Sheridan, Kerry|title=Medical Ethics of Hippocrates or Population-Based Bioethics \u2014 A Symposium|url=http://www.haciendapub.com/articles/medical-ethics-hippocrates-or-population-based-bioethics-%E2%80%94-symposium-based-interview-dr-mig#comment-1065|publisher=Hacienda Publishing|accessdate=18 May 2014}}</ref> Why the danger of population-based bioethics?<ref name=AFP>{{cite web|last=Sheridan|first=Kerry|title=U.S. Experts urge focus on ethics in brain research|url=https://news.yahoo.com/us-experts-urge-focus-ethics-brain-research-151243732.html%20;_ylt=A0LEVxPMjnNTmA0AsK5XNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTB0MnRoNXFhBHNlYwNzYwRjb2xvA2JmMQR2dGlk%20A1NNRTM0Nl8x|publisher=Yahoo News.

It concerns the ethical, legal and social impact of neuroscience, including the ways in which neurotechnology can be used to predict or alter human behavior and \"the implications of our mechanistic understanding of brain function for society... integrating neuroscientific knowledge with ethical and social thought\".\n\nSome neuroethics problems are not fundamentally different from those encountered in [[bioethics]]. Others are unique to neuroethics because the brain, as the organ of the mind, has implications for broader philosophical problems, such as the nature of [[free will]], [[moral responsibility]], [[self-deception]], and [[personal identity]].<ref>Farah Martha J., Neuroethics: An Introduction with Readings, 2010</ref> Examples of neuroethics topics are given later in this article (\"[[#Key issues|Key issues in neuroethics]]\").\n\nThe origin of the term \"neuroethics\" has occupied some writers. Rees and Rose (as cited in \"References\" on page 9){{Inconsistent}} claim ''neuroethics'' is a [[neologism]] that emerged only at the beginning of the 21st century, largely through the [[Speech communication|oral]] and [[Writing|written]] [[communication]]s of [[ethicist]]s and [[philosopher]]s.  According to Racine (2010), the term was coined by the Harvard physician Anneliese A. Pontius in 1973 in a paper entitled \"Neuro-ethics of 'walking' in the newborn\" for the ''Perceptual and Motor Skills''. The author reproposed the term in 1993 in her paper for ''Psychological Report'', often wrongly mentioned as the first title containing the word \"neuroethics\". Before 1993, the American neurologist Ronald Cranford has used the term (see Cranford 1989).  Illes (2003) records uses, from the scientific literature, from 1989 and 1991.  Writer [[William Safire]] is widely credited with giving the word its current meaning in 2002, defining it as \"the examination of what is right and wrong, good and bad about the treatment of, perfection of, or unwelcome invasion of and worrisome manipulation of the human brain\".<ref>Safire, W. Visions for a New Field of \"Neuroethics\" Neuroethics Mapping the Field Conference Proceedings. May 13\u201314, 2002. San Francisco, California</ref>\n\n==Two categories of problems==\nNeuroethics encompasses the myriad ways in which developments in basic and clinical neuroscience intersect with social and ethical issues. The field is so young that any attempt to define its scope and limits now will undoubtedly be proved wrong in the future, as [[neuroscience]] develops and its implications continue to be revealed. At present, however, we can discern two general categories of neuroethical issue: those emerging from what we can do and those emerging from what we know.\n\nIn the first category are the ethical problems raised by advances in functional [[neuroimaging]], [[psychopharmacology]], [[brain implants]] and [[Cyborg|brain-machine interfaces]]. In the second category are the ethical problems raised by our growing understanding of the neural bases of behavior, personality, consciousness, and states of spiritual transcendence.\n\n==Historical background and implications of neuroscience ethics==\n[[Primitive culture|Primitive]] societies for the most part lacked a system of neuroethics to guide them in facing the problems of mental illness and violence as civilization advanced.

In the 20th century in both the communist [[USSR]] and [[Nazi Germany]], medicine regressed after these authoritarian systems corrupted the ethics of the medical profession and forced it to descend to unprecedented barbarism. The Soviet [[psychiatrists]] and Nazi doctor's dark descent into barbarism was a product of [[physicians]] willingly cooperating with the [[totalitarian state]], purportedly in the name of the \"[[Common good|collective good]]\", at the expense of their individual patients.\" This must be kept in mind when establishing new guidelines in neuroscience research and bioethics.<ref name=\"Faria 3\" />\n\n==Important activity since 2002 ==\nThere is no doubt that people were thinking and writing about the ethical implications of [[neuroscience]] for many years before the field adopted the label \"neuroethics\", and some of this work remains of great relevance and value.  However, the early 21st century saw a tremendous surge in interest concerning the ethics of [[neuroscience]], as evidenced by numerous meetings, publications and organizations dedicated to this topic.\n\nIn 2002, there were several meetings that drew together neuroscientists and ethicists to discuss neuroethics:  the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] with the journal ''[[Neuron (journal)|Neuron]]'', the [[University of Pennsylvania]], the [[Royal Society]], [[Stanford University]], and the [[Dana Foundation]].  This last meeting was the largest, and resulted in a book, ''Neuroethics: Mapping the Field'', edited by Steven J. Marcus and published by Dana Press.   That same year, the ''Economist'' ran a cover story entitled \"Open Your Mind: The Ethics of Brain Science\", ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' published the article \"Emerging ethical issues in neuroscience\".<ref>{{cite journal | author = Farah Martha J | year = 2002 | title = Emerging ethical issues in neuroscience | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 5 | issue = 11| pages = 1123\u2013129 | doi=10.1038/nn1102-1123| pmid = 12404006 | url = https://repository.upenn.edu/neuroethics_pubs/13 }}</ref> Further articles appeared on neuroethics in ''[[Nature Neuroscience]]'', ''Neuron'', and ''[[Brain and Cognition]]''.\n\nThereafter, the number of neuroethics meetings, symposia and publications continued to grow.  The over 38 000 members of the [[Society for Neuroscience]] recognized the importance of neuroethics by inaugurating an annual \"special lecture\" on the topic, first given by [[Donald Kennedy]], editor-in-chief of Science Magazine.  Several overlapping networks of scientists and scholars began to coalesce around neuroethics-related projects and themes.  For example, the American Society for Bioethics and Humanities established a Neuroethics Affinity Group, students at the [[London School of Economics]] established the Neuroscience and Society Network linking scholars from several different institutions, and a group of scientists and funders from around the world began discussing ways to support international collaboration in neuroethics through what came to be called the International Neuroethics Network.  Stanford began publishing the monthly Stanford Neuroethics Newsletter, Penn developed the informational website neuroethics.upenn.edu, and the Neuroethics and Law Blog was launched.\n\nSeveral relevant books were published during this time as well: Sandra Ackerman's ''Hard Science, Hard Choices: Facts, Ethics and Policies Guiding Brain Science Today'' (Dana Press), Michael Gazzaniga's ''The Ethical Brain'' (Dana Press), Judy Illes' edited volume, ''Neuroethics: Defining the Issues in Theory, Practice and Policy'' (both Oxford University Press), [[Dai Rees (scientist)|Dai Rees]] and Steven Rose's edited volume ''The New Brain Sciences: Perils and Prospects'' (Cambridge University Press) and Steven Rose's ''The Future of the Brain'' (Oxford University Press).\n\n2006 marked the founding of the [[International Neuroethics Society|International Neuroethics Society (INS)]] (originally the Neuroethics Society), an international group of scholars, scientists, clinicians, and other professionals who share an interest in the social, legal, ethical and policy implications of advances in neuroscience. The mission of the International Neuroethics Society \"is to promote the development and responsible application of neuroscience through interdisciplinary and international research, education, outreach and public engagement for the benefit of people of all nations, ethnicities, and cultures\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Neurogaming: What's Neuroscience and Ethics Got To Do With It?|url=http://www.ethicscenter.net/Neurogaming-November2013|website=The Center for Ethics in Science and Technology|accessdate=28 September 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809044403/http://www.ethicscenter.net/Neurogaming-November2013|archivedate=9 August 2014}}</ref> The first President of the INS was Steven Hyman (2006\u20132014),  succeeded by [[Barbara Sahakian]] (2014\u20132016).

For example, readings and websites that focus on specific aspects of neuroethics, such as brain imaging or enhancement, are not included.  Nor are more recent sources, such as Walter Glannon's book ''Bioethics and the Brain'' (Oxford University Press) and his reader, entitled Defining Right and Wrong in Brain Science (Dana Press).  We should also here mention a book that was in many ways ahead of its time, Robert Blank's Brain Policy (published in 1999 by Georgetown University Press).  The scholarly literature on neuroethics has grown so quickly that one cannot easily list all of the worthwhile articles, and several journals are now soliciting neuroethics submissions for publication, including the ''American Journal of Bioethics \u2013 Neuroscience'', ''BioSocieties'', the ''Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience'', and ''Neuroethics''.  The web now has many sites, blogs and portals offering information about neuroethics.  A list can be found at the end of this entry.\n\n==Key issues==\nNeuroethics encompasses a wide range of issues, which can only be sampled here.<ref name=\"LeefmannLevallois2016\">{{cite journal|last1=Leefmann|first1=Jon|last2=Levallois|first2=Clement|last3=Hildt|first3=Elisabeth|title=Neuroethics 1995\u20132012.

For example, how should incidental findings be handled when a presumed healthy research subject is scanned for neuroscience research and the scan reveals an abnormality?  How safe are the drugs used to enhance normal brain function?  These are neuroethical issues with clear precedents in traditional bioethics.  They are important issues, and luckily we can call upon society's experience with the relevant precedents to help determine the best courses of action in the present cases.  In contrast, many neuroethical issues are at least partly novel, and this accounts for some of the intellectual fascination of neuroethics.  These relatively newer issues force us to think about the relation between mind and brain and its ethical implications.\n\n===Brain interventions===\nThe ethics of neurocognitive enhancement, that is the use of drugs and other brain interventions to make normal people \"better than well\", is an example of a neuroethical issue with both familiar and novel aspects.  On the one hand, we can be informed by previous bioethical work on physical enhancements such as [[Doping in sport|doping for strength in sports]] and the use of [[Growth hormone treatment|human growth hormone for normal boys of short stature]].  On the other hand, there are also some arguably novel ethical issues that arise in connection with brain enhancement, because these enhancements affect how people think and feel, thus raising the relatively new issues of \"[[cognitive liberty]]\".  The growing role of [[psychopharmacology]] in everyday life raises a number of ethical issues, for example the influence of drug marketing on our conceptions of mental health and [[Normality (behavior)|normalcy]], and the increasingly malleable sense of [[personal identity]] that results from what [[Peter D. Kramer]] called \"cosmetic psychopharmacology\".\n\nNonpharmacologic methods of altering brain function are currently enjoying a period of rapid development, with a resurgence of [[psychosurgery]] for the treatment of medication refractory mental illnesses and promising new therapies for neurological and psychiatric illnesses based on [[deep brain stimulation]] as well as relatively noninvasive [[transcranial stimulation (disambiguation)|transcranial stimulation]] methods.  Research on brain-machine interfaces is primarily in a preclinical phase but promises to enable thought-based control of computers and robots by paralyzed patients.  As the tragic history of [[frontal lobotomy]] reminds us, permanent alteration of the brain cannot be undertaken lightly.  Although nonpharmacologic brain interventions are exclusively aimed at therapeutic goals, the US military sponsors research in this general area (and more specifically in the use of [[transcranial direct current stimulation]]) that is presumably aimed at enhancing the capabilities of soldiers.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Neurostimulation Devices for Cognitive Enhancement: Toward a Comprehensive Regulatory Framework|date=1 August 2015|journal=Neuroethics|volume=8|issue=2|pages=115\u2013126|author=Dubljevic, V.|doi=10.1007/s12152-014-9225-0}}</ref>\n\n===Brain imaging===\nIn addition to the important issues of safety and incidental findings, mentioned above, some arise from the unprecedented and rapidly developing ability to correlate brain activation with psychological states and traits. One of the most widely discussed new applications of imaging is based on correlations between brain activity and [[Lie|intentional deception]]. Intentional deception can be thought of in the context of a [[Polygraph|lie detector]]. This means that scientists use brain imaging to look at certain parts of the brain during moments when a person is being deceptive. A number of different research groups have identified [[fMRI]] correlates of intentional deception in laboratory tasks, and despite the skepticism of many experts, the technique has already been commercialized.  A more feasible application of brain imaging is \"[[neuromarketing]]\", whereby people's conscious or unconscious reaction to certain products can purportedly be measured.\n\nResearchers are also finding brain imaging correlates of myriad psychological traits, including personality, intelligence, mental health vulnerabilities, attitudes toward particular ethnic groups, and predilection for violent crime.  Unconscious racial attitudes may be manifest in brain activation.  These capabilities of brain imaging, actual and potential, raise a number of ethical issues.  The most obvious concern involves [[privacy]].  For example, employers, marketers, and the government all have a strong interest in knowing the abilities, personality, truthfulness and other mental contents of certain people.  This raises the question of whether, when, and how to ensure the [[Privacy laws of the United States#Intrusion of solitude and seclusion|privacy of our own minds]].\n\nAnother ethical problem is that brain scans are often viewed as more accurate and objective than in fact they are.  Many layers of signal processing, statistical analysis and interpretation separate imaged brain activity from the psychological traits and states inferred from it.  There is a danger that the public (including judges and juries, employers, insurers, etc.) will ignore these complexities and treat brain images as a kind of indisputable truth.\n\nA related misconception is called neuro-realism:  In its simplest form, this line of thought says that something is real because it can be measured with electronic equipment.  A person who claims to have pain, or low libido, or unpleasant emotions is \"really\" sick if these symptoms are supported by a brain scan, and healthy or normal if correlates cannot be found in a brain scan.<ref name=Gordijn>{{cite book \n |author1=Gordijn Bert |author2=Giordano James J. | title=Scientific and Philosophical Perspectives in Neuroethics \n | publisher=Cambridge University Press \n | location=Cambridge, UK \n | year=2010 \n | pages=256\u2013262\n | isbn=978-0-521-70303-1 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news \n | title=Lost your libido?

Propranolol, an FDA-approved drug, has been suggested to effectively dull the painful effects of traumatic memories if taken within 6 hours after the event occurs.<ref>''Elsey, J. J. W. B.

However, doctors are permitted to use the drug for off-label purposes\u2014leading to the question of whether they actually ''should''. There are numerous reasons for skepticism; for one, it may prevent us from coming to terms with traumatic experiences, it may tamper with our identities and lead us to an artificial sense of happiness, demean the genuineness of human life, and/or encourage some to forget memories they are morally obligated to keep. Whether or not it is ethical to fully or partially erase the memory of a patient, it is certainly becoming a more relevant topic as this technology improves in our society.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Farah|first1=Martha|title=Neuroethics: an introduction withreadings|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press|isbn=9780262062695|pages=97\u20138}}</ref>\n\n===Stem cell therapy===\n\nMost of the issues concerning uses of [[stem cell]]s in the brain are the same as any of the bioethical or purely ethical questions you will find regarding the use and research of stem cells.

Since most stem cell research is still in its preliminary phase most of the neuroethical issues surrounding stem cells are the same as [[Stem cell controversy|stem cell ethics]] in general.\n\nMore specifically the way that stem cell research has been involved in neuroscience is through the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and brain tumors. In these cases scientists are using [[neural stem cell]]s to regenerate tissue and to be used as carriers for [[gene therapy]]. In general, neuroethics revolves around a cost benefit approach to find techniques and technologies that are most beneficial to patients. There has been progress in certain fields that have been shown to be beneficial when using stem cells to treat certain neurodegenerative diseases such as [[Parkinson's disease]].<ref>{{Cite journal |pmid = 21371482|pmc = 3087494|year = 2011|last1 = Vaccarino|first1 = F.

Animal studies have shown that the use of iPSCs can improve motor skills and dopamine release of test subjects with Parkinson's. This study shows a positive outcome in the use of stem cells for neurological purposes.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=L W|author2=F Kuang |author3=L C Wei |author4=Y X Ding |author5=K K L Yung |author6=Y S Chan |title=Potential application of induced pluripotent stem cells in cell replacement therapy for Parkinson's disease|journal=CNS & Neurological Disorders Drug Targets|date=Jun 2011|volume=10|issue=4|pages=449\u2013458|pmid=21495962|doi=10.2174/187152711795563994}}</ref>\n\nIn another study done in 2011 used stem cells to treat [[cerebral palsy]]. This study, however, was not as successful as the Parkinson's treatment. In this case stem cells were used to treat animal models who had been injured in a way that mimicked CP. This brings up a neuroethical issue of animal models used in science. Since most of their \"diseases\" are inflicted and do not occur naturally, they can not always be reliable examples of how a person with the actual disease would respond to treatment. The stem cells used did survive implantation, but did not show significant nerve regeneration. However, studies are ongoing in this area.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bell|first=Emily|author2=Isabelle Chouinard |author3=Michael Shevell |author4=Eric Racine |title=Responding to requests of families for unproven interventions in neurodevelopmental disorders: hyperbaric oxygen \"treatment\" and stem cell \"therapy\" in cerebral palsy.|journal=Developmental Disabilities Research Reviews|year=2011|volume=17|issue=1|pages=19\u201326|doi=10.1002/ddrr.134|pmid=22447751}}</ref>\n\nAs discussed, stem cells are used to treat degenerative diseases. One form of a degenerative disease that can occur in the brain as well as throughout the body is an [[autoimmune disease]]. Autoimmune diseases cause the body to \"attack\" its own cells and therefore destroys those cells as well as whatever functional purpose those cells have or contribute to. One form of an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system is [[multiple sclerosis]]. In this disease the body attacks the [[glial cells]] that form myelin coats around the axons on neurons. This causes the nervous system to essentially \"short circuit\" and pass information very slowly. Stem cells therapy has been used to try to cure some of the damage caused by the body in MS. [[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation]] has been used to try and cure MS patients by essentially \"reprogramming\" their immune system. The main risk encountered with this form of treatment is the possibility of rejection of the stem cells. If the hematopoetic stem cells can be harvested from the individual, risk of rejection is much lower. But, there can be the risk of those cells being programmed to induce MS. However, if the tissue is donated from another individual there is high risk of rejection leading to possibly fatal toxicity in the recipient's body. Considering that there are fairly good treatments for MS, the use of stem cells in this case may have a higher cost than the benefits they produce. However, as research continues perhaps stem cells will truly become a viable treatment for MS as well as other autoimmune diseases.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Silani|first=Vincenzo|author2=Lidia Cova|title=Stem cell transplantation in Multiple Sclerosis: Safety and Ethics|journal=Journal of the Neurological Sciences|date=15 February 2008|volume=265|issue=1\u20132|pages=116\u2013121|doi=10.1016/j.jns.2007.06.010|pmid=17619025}}</ref>\n\nThese are just some examples of neurological diseases in which stem cell treatment has been researched. In general, the future looks promising for stem cell application in the field of neurology. However, possible complications lie in the overall ethics of stem cell use, possible recipient rejection, as well as over-proliferation of the cells causing possible brain tumors. Ongoing research will further contribute in the decision of whether stem cells should be used in the brain and whether their benefits truly outweigh their costs.\n\nThe primary ethical dilemma that is brought up in stem cell research is concerning the source of [[embryonic stem cells]] (hESCs). As the name states, hESCs come from embryos. To be more specific, they come from the [[inner cell mass]] of a blastophere, which is the beginning stage of an embryo. However, that mass of cells could have the potential to give rise to human life, and there in lies the problem. Often, this argument leads back to a similar moral debate held around abortion. The question is: when does a mass of cells gain personhood and autonomy?<ref>{{cite journal|last=Barker|first=Roger A|author2=Inez de Beaufort|title=Scientific and ethical issues related to stem cell research and interventions in neurodegenerative disorders of the brain|journal=Progress in Neurobiology|date=November 2013|volume=110|pages=63\u201373|doi=10.1016/j.pneurobio.2013.04.003|pmid=23665410}}</ref> Some individuals believe that an embryo is in fact a person at the moment of conception and that using an embryo for anything other than creating a baby would essentially be killing a baby. On the other end of the spectrum, people argue that the small ball of cells at that point only has the potential to become a fetus, and that potentiality, even in natural conception, is far from guaranteed. According to a study done by developmental biologists, between 75\u201380% of embryos created through intercourse are naturally lost before they can become fetuses.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hyun|first=Insoo|title=The bioethics of stem cell research and therapy|journal=The Journal of Clinical Investigation|date=4 January 2010|volume=120|issue=1|pages=71\u201375|doi=10.1172/jci40435|pmid=20051638|pmc=2798696}}</ref> This debate is not one that has a right or wrong answer, nor can it be clearly settled.  Much of the ethical dilemma surrounding hESCs relies on individual beliefs about life and the potential for scientific advancement versus creating new human life.\n\n=== Disorders of consciousness ===\n\nPatients in coma, vegetative, or minimally conscious state pose ethical challenges. The patients are unable to respond, therefore the assessment of their needs can only be approached by adopting a third person perspective. They are unable to communicate their pain levels, quality of life, or end of life preferences. Neuroscience and brain imaging have allowed us to explore the brain activity of these patients more thoroughly. Recent findings from studies using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] have changed the way we view vegetative patients. The images have shown that aspects emotional processing, language comprehension and even conscious awareness might be retained in patients whose behavior suggests a vegetative state. If this is the case, it is unethical to allow a third party to dictate the life and future of the patient.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bruno|first=Marie-Aur\u00e9lie|author2=Steven Laureys|title=Coma and disorders of consciousness|journal=Handbook of Clinical Neurology|year=2013|volume=118|pages=205\u2013213|doi=10.1016/b978-0-444-53501-6.00017-2|pmid=24182379|isbn=9780444535016}}</ref>  For example, defining death is an issue that comes with patients with severe traumatic brain injuries. The decision to withdraw life-sustaining care from these patients can be based on uncertain assessments about the individual's conscious awareness. Case reports have shown that these patients in a persistent vegetative state can recover unexpectedly. This raises the ethical question about the premature termination of care by physicians. The hope is that one day, neuroimaging technologies can help us to define these different states of consciousness and enable us to communicate with patients in vegetative states in a way that was never before possible.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Catherine|first=Rodrigue|title=Perspectives and Experience of Healthcare Professionals on Diagnosis, Prognosis, and End-of-Life Decision Making in Patients with Disorders of Consciousness|journal=Neuroethics|date=2013-04-01|volume=6|issue=1|pages=25\u201336|doi=10.1007/s12152-011-9142-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Fins|first=Joseph J.|title=Neuroethics, Neuroimaging, and Disorders of Consciousness: Promise or Peril?|journal=Transactions of the American Clinical and Climatological Association|year=2011|volume=122|pages=336\u2013346|pmc=3116331|pmid=21686236}}</ref> The clinical translation of these advanced technologies is of vital importance for the medical management of these challenging patients.

Some case reports with the antidepressant [[Prozac]] indicated that patients seemed \"better than well\", and authors hypothesized that this effect might be observed in individuals not afflicted with psychiatric disorders. Following these case reports much controversy arose over the veracity and ethics of the cosmetic use of these antidepressants.  Opponents of [[cosmetic pharmacology]] believe that such drug usage is unethical and that the concept of cosmetic pharmacology is a manifestation of naive consumerism. Proponents, such as philosopher [[Arthur Caplan]], state that it is an individual's (rather than government's, or physician's) right to determine  whether to use a drug for cosmetic purposes.<ref>Caplan, Arthur.  Is Better Best?  A Noted Ethicist Argues in Favor of Brain Enhancement.  Scientific American.  September, 2003.

This has already been happening within the elections throughout the years. In the 2006 reelection of Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], he was double digits off in the voting in comparison to his Democratic opponent. However, Schwarzenegger's theme in this campaign was whether or not the voters would want to continue Schwarzenegger's reforms or go back to the days of the recalled governor, [[Gray Davis]]. In normal marketing, voters would use \"detail, numbers, facts and figures to prove we were better off under the new governor\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.campaignsandelections.com/magazine/2306/the-power-of-neuromarketing|title=The power of neuromarketing}}</ref> However, with neuromarketing, voters followed powerful advertisement visuals and used these visuals to convince themselves that Schwarzenegger was the better candidate. Now, with political neuromarketing, there exists a lot of controversy. The ethics behind political neuromarketing are debatable. Some argue that political neuromarketing will cause voters to make rash decisions while others argue that these messages are beneficial because they depict what the politicians can do. However, control over political decisions could make voters not see the reality of things. Voters may not look into the details of the reforms, personality, and morality each person brings to their political campaign and may be swayed by how powerful the advertisements seem to be. However, there are also people that may disagree with this idea. Darryl Howard, \"a consultant to two Republican winners on November 2, says he crafted neuromarketing-based messages for TV, direct mail and speeches for Senate, Congressional and [[Governor (United States)|Gubernatorial]] clients in 2010\". He says that these advertisements that were presented, show honesty and continues to say how he and other politicians decide which advertisements are the most effective.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.upperplayground.com/tag/darryl-howard|title=Upper Playground - darryl-howard|website=news.upperplayground.com}}</ref>\n\n===Neurological treatments ===\n\nNeuroscience has led to a deeper understanding of the chemical imbalances present in a disordered brain. In turn, this has resulted in the creation of new treatments and medications to treat these disorders. When these new [[Clinical trial|treatments are first being tested]], the experiments prompt ethical questions. First, because the treatment is affecting the brain, the side effects can be unique and sometimes severe. A special kind of side effect that many subjects have claimed to experience in neurological treatment tests is changes in \"[[personal identity]]\". Although this is a difficult ethical dilemma because there are no clear and undisputed definitions of personality, self, and identity, neurological treatments can result in patients losing parts of \"themselves\" such as memories or moods. Yet another ethical dispute in neurological treatment research is the [[Triage|choice of patients]]. From a perspective of justice, priority should be given to those who are most seriously impaired and who will benefit most from the intervention. However, in a test group, scientists must select patients to secure a favorable risk-benefit ratio. Setting priority becomes more difficult when a patient's chance to benefit and the seriousness of their impairment do not go together. For example, many times an older patient will be excluded despite the seriousness of their disorder simply because they are not as strong or as likely to benefit from the treatment.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mohamed|first=Ahmed D.|author2=Barbara J. Sahakian|title=The ethics of elective psychopharmacology|journal=The International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology|year=2012|volume=15|issue=4|pages=559\u2013571|doi=10.1017/s146114571100037x|pmid=21396152|pmc=3325502}}</ref> The main ethical issue at the heart of neurological treatment research on human subjects is promoting high-quality scientific research in the interest of future patients, while at the same time respecting and guarding the rights and interests of the research subjects. This is particularly difficult in the field of [[neurology]] because damage to the brain is often permanent and will change a patient's way of life forever.\n\n===Neuroscience and free will===\n{{Also|Neuroscience of free will}}\n\nNeuroethics also encompasses the ethical issues raised by neuroscience as it affects our understanding of the world and of ourselves in the world.  For example, if everything we do is physically caused by our brains, which are in turn a product of our genes and our life experiences, how can we be held responsible for our actions?  A [[crime]] in the United States requires a \"[[Actus reus|guilty act]]\" and a \"[[Mens rea|guilty mind]]\". As [[neuropsychiatry]] evaluations have become more commonly used in the criminal justice system and [[neuroimaging]] technologies have given us a more direct way of viewing brain injuries, scholars have cautioned that this could lead to the inability to hold anyone criminally responsible for their actions. In this way, neuroimaging evidence could suggest that there is no free will and each action a person makes is simply the product of past actions and biological impulses that are out of our control.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Neuroscience, Neuropolitics and Neuroethics: The Complex Case of Crime, Deception and fMRI - Springer|journal=Neuroscience, Neuropolitics and Neuroethics| doi=10.1007/s11948-012-9393-4|pmid=23054671|volume=18|issue=3|pages=573\u2013591|year=2012|last1=Henry|first1=Stuart|last2=Plemmons|first2=Dena}}</ref>  The question of whether and how personal [[autonomy]] is compatible with neuroscience ethics and the responsibility of neuroscientists to society and the state is a central one for neuroethics.<ref name=\"Aggarwal 2013\"/> However, there is some controversy over whether autonomy entails the concept of 'free will' or is a 'moral-political' principle separate from metaphysical quandaries.<ref>Dubljevic, V. 2013: Autonomy in Neuroethics: Political and not metaphysical, AJOB-Neuroscience 4(4):44-51 https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21507740.2013.819390</ref>\nIn late 2013 U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] made recommendations to the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues as part of his $100 million Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative.

[[Miguel Faria]], a Professor of Neurosurgery and an Associate Editor in Chief of [[Surgical Neurology International]], who was not involved in the Commission's work said, \"any ethics approach must be based upon respect for the individual, as doctors pledge according to the [[Hippocratic Oath]] which includes vows to be humble, respect privacy and doing no harm; and pursuing a path based on population-based ethics is just as dangerous as having no medical ethics at all\".<ref name=\"Faria Hacienda\">{{cite web|author1=Faria, Miguel A  |author2=Sheridan, Kerry|title=Medical Ethics of Hippocrates or Population-Based Bioethics \u2014 A Symposium|url=http://www.haciendapub.com/articles/medical-ethics-hippocrates-or-population-based-bioethics-%E2%80%94-symposium-based-interview-dr-mig#comment-1065|publisher=Hacienda Publishing|accessdate=18 May 2014}}</ref> Why the danger of population-based bioethics?<ref name=AFP>{{cite web|last=Sheridan|first=Kerry|title=U.S. Experts urge focus on ethics in brain research|url=https://news.yahoo.com/us-experts-urge-focus-ethics-brain-research-151243732.html%20;_ylt=A0LEVxPMjnNTmA0AsK5XNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTB0MnRoNXFhBHNlYwNzYwRjb2xvA2JmMQR2dGlk%20A1NNRTM0Nl8x|publisher=Yahoo News.

It originally aired on Monday, April 25, 2011 on the [[The CW Television Network|CW]].\n\n''Petty in Pink'' delves into the deteriorating friendship between [[Dan Humphrey]] ([[Penn Badgley]]) and [[Vanessa Abrams]] ([[Jessica Szohr]]), amends and reflections that Lily Humphrey ([[Kelly Rutherford]]) slowly absorbs as her house arrest soon makes her realize, Charlie Rhodes' ([[Kaylee DeFer]]) integration into the world of the [[Upper East Side]], the continued dilemma that [[Chuck Bass]] ([[Ed Westwick]]) faces as he continues to hold on to the burdening secret of his legacy as well as the impact it might cause to Raina Thorpe ([[Tika Sumpter]]), and the fairytale romance between [[Blair Waldorf]] ([[Leighton Meester]]) and Louis Grimaldi ([[Hugo Becker (actor)|Hugo Becker]]). The episode drew positive reviews from critics with critical praise towards Leighton Meester, Penn Badgley, and Ed Westwick.\n\n==Plot==\nThe opening montage shows Blair Waldorf preparing for her date with Louis, having received the heel that she gave him as a parting gift from Paris. Lily van der Woodsen ([[Kelly Rutherford]]) finds herself under house arrest in her apartment, spending time through online shopping and preparing the Pink Party, a cancer awareness charity event. As she makes her preparations, Anne Archibald ([[Francie Swift]]) arrives to tell Lily that the gift bags will be prepared at a different venue. Lily soon realizes that her incriminated status has caused her supposed friends to shun her. When Blair decides to skip a class and commands that her minions go take her class take notes for her. She keeps the identity of her date secret until Penelope ([[Amanda Setton]]) sends a tip to Gossip Girl that Blair has a secret date. Following a voice mail from Vanessa about Dan and Blair's kiss, Serena ([[Blake Lively]]) recruits Charlie to help her find information behind Dan and Blair's kiss, training Charlie in the methods of using Gossip Girl and receives word of Blair's date on her blog. At the loft, Rufus ([[Matthew Settle]]) inspires Dan to repair his friendship with Vanessa and leaves Dan, who finds himself on a job writing an article involving a royal that recently arrived in New York.\n\nCharlie finds herself on stakeout and sees Dan and Blair having a conversation at the restaurant counter. Charlie informs Serena of Blair and Dan's date but is unaware that Dan had left after Blair forces him out to make her date with Louis. Shortly, Serena arrives at the restaurant and realizes that Blair is dating Louis, shrugging off her suspicions that Dan and Blair are seeing each other. Insisting that she couldn't have mistaken Dan for someone else, Serena praises her work but Charlie excuses herself, saying that she'll be staying to scout out [[New York University]]. As Serena leaves, the audience sees Charlie using the Gossip Girl spotted map, looking for Dan.\n\nAt the Empire Hotel, Raina finds herself troubled over the whereabouts of her mother and enlists that aid of a private investigator. Nate however, suspects something when he sees a change in Chuck's demeanor and follows Raina. Chuck later discovers that Raina is looking for her mother. Around [[New York University|NYU]] Dan calls Vanessa and patch their differences, inviting her over at the loft.\n\nBlair and Louis find themselves being tracked down by Lucien ([[Dominik Tiefenthaler]]), Louis' royal adviser, and Blair discovers that Lucien had bribed Dan on the pretense that he was interested in Dan's writing. Blair calls Dan and demands that he meet her at a store. Charlie continues her investigation of Dan and finds him with Blair, who plans her scheme to drive out Louis. Blair persuades Dan to stage a fake relationship at the Pink party thereby convincing Lucien to leave without Louis and for Blair to be able to spend time with him. Charlie takes a photo of Blair presenting a pink tie to Dan and sends it to Serena, who conspires with Eric and Rufus to have the Pink party moved at the van der Woodsen apartment. Serena decides to blackmail a party planner to keep an eye on Dan and Blair. The move complicates Dan and Blair's scheme as they both fear that Serena will find out about their scheme and misunderstand their intentions behind it. Nate and Raina proceed to leave for New Jersey after discovering that Raina's possible mother was there and Chuck decides to accompany them.\n\nAt a diner, Nate, Chuck and Raina confront a waitress who fits her mother's description but finds a case of mistaken identity. Returning to the Empire Hotel, Chuck enlists the aid of his private investigator to investigate the events that lead to the death of Raina's mother. The transfer of the Pink party draws the ire of Lily's guests, especially Anne, who confronts Lily over the party transfer. Lily realizes that someone had moved the party and that none of the women whom she considered as friends consider her as a friend. Dan and Blair succeed in their scheme but are unaware that Charlie has been filming their kiss and sends it to Gossip Girl, who sends a blast to everyone at the party. Dan finds out that Charlie was responsible as he and Blair look for Serena. Serena tells Louis that Blair has been lying to him and Dan and Blair explain everything to her. Serena finds herself betrayed further conflict rises when Serena raises Blair's jealousy being the reason why she finds herself drawn to Dan until Blair berates Serena's arrogance and her need to be the center of attention. Blair leaves Serena to look for Louis. Unable to take the scrutiny, Lily disobeys her house arrest and goes down to the lobby, waiting for the police to arrive. The police arrive but Lily asks them to shut down the event, at the same time avoiding arrest. Charlie later arrives at Brooklyn to apologize to Dan, adding that everything had happened because of Vanessa's message to Serena.\n\nThe closing montage shows Blair convincing Louis that she loves him and make their relationship public, Dan shutting out Vanessa and severing ties with her while letting Charlie stay for a drink, Serena calling Louis' driver, and Chuck watching the security tapes that recorded the night of Avery Thorpe's disappearance.\n\n==Production==\n===Filming Locations===\nThe phone call between Dan and Vanessa was filmed in on the 16th Street between Broadway Ave and Fifth Ave. [[Veselka]] is used on set to film the scene of a date between Blair and Louis as well as Charlie's look out for a possible affair between Blair and Dan.<ref name=\"''Gossip Girl'' Recap: Your Monitor Is Showing\">{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2011/04/gossip_girl_recap_your_monitor.html|title=''Gossip Girl'' Recap: Your Monitor Is Showing|last=|first=|date=April 26, 2011|work=New York Magazine|accessdate=April 30, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Fashion===\n''[[New York Magazine]]'' praised the [[Roger Vivier]] heel that Blair wore from the Paris story arc, calling it a \"recap-worthy memory.\"<ref name=\"''Gossip Girl'' Recap: Your Monitor Is Showing\" />\n\n''[[InStyle]]'' reported news of the clothing for the cast to wear for a cancer awareness-month themed episode that would host a pink party for the set.
