[[world tag team championship]] contested in [[WWE]] on the [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] brand. Unveiled on the August 23, 2016 episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown Live]]'', it was created to be the counterpart title to the then-WWE Tag Team Championship, which became exclusive to [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] as a result of the [[2016 WWE draft]] and was renamed to [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|Raw Tag Team Championship]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Martin|first1=Adam|title=Daniel Bryan to reveal two new championships exclusive to Smackdown tonight from Connecticut|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/wwe-news/66258-daniel-bryan-reveal-two-new-championships-exclusive-smackdown-live-tonight-connecticut/|website=wrestleview.com|accessdate=August 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe championship is generally contested in [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]], in which participants execute [[Screenplay|scripted]] finishes rather than contend in [[Competition#Sports|direct competition]]. The inaugural champions were [[Heath Slater]] and [[Rhyno]], who won the title in a tournament final at [[Backlash (2016)|Backlash]] on September 11, 2016. The current champions are [[The New Day (professional wrestling)|The New Day]], who are in their sixth reign as a team; individually, it is the sixth reign for [[Big E (wrestler)|Big E]] and the fifth for [[Kofi Kingston]]. Big E represented the team in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|triple threat match]] involving [[Jey Uso]] (of [[The Usos]]) and then-co-champion [[The Miz]] (of [[John Morrison and The Miz]]) on the April 17, 2020 episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]]''.\n\nAs of {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTDAY}}, {{CURRENTYEAR}}, overall there have been 19 reigns between 12 teams composed of 23 individual champions, and one vacancy. The team of [[Heath Slater]] and [[Rhyno]] were the inaugural champions. [[The New Day (professional wrestling)|The New Day]] as a stable have the most reigns at five, while individually, stable member [[Big E (wrestler)|Big E]] has the most reigns, also at five. As a team and individually, [[The Usos]] (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) have the longest singular reign at 182 days for their third reign, and they have the longest combined reign at 381 days (380 days as recognized by WWE). [[The Miz]] & [[Shane McMahon]] and [[The Hardy Boyz]] ([[Jeff Hardy]] and [[Matt Hardy]]) are tied with the shortest reign at 21 days (although WWE recognizes The Hardy Boyz as the shortest at 20 days). The oldest champion is Shane McMahon, winning the title at 49 years old, while the youngest is [[Jason Jordan]] when he won it at 28.\n\n== Reigns ==\n{{Professional wrestling title history top|active=yes|team=yes|days2=yes}}\n{{PWtitlereign\n|number   = 1\n|champion = {{sortname|Heath|Slater}} and {{sortname||Rhyno|Rhyno}}\n|reign    = 1\n|date     = {{dts|September 11, 2016}}\n|days     = {{age in days nts|September 11, 2016|December 4, 2016}}\n|days2    = {{age in days nts|September 11, 2016|December 3, 2016}}\n|location = [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond, VA]]\n|event    = [[Backlash (2016)|Backlash]]\n|notes    = As a result of the [[2016 WWE draft]], the [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|WWE Tag Team Championship]] became exclusive to [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]].

At an international meeting at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in 1971, biolinguistics was introduced as a highly interdisciplinary field,  including [[linguistics]], [[biology]], [[neuroscience]], [[psychology]], [[mathematics]], and others. By embracing the [[natural science]]s, it seeks to yield a framework through which we can understand the fundamentals of [[Language faculty|the faculty of language]]. \nBiolinguistics, also called the biolinguistic enterprise or the biolinguistic approach, is believed to have its origins in [[Noam Chomsky]]\u2019s and [[Eric Lenneberg]]\u2019s work on language acquisition that began in the 1950s as a reaction to the then-dominant behaviorist paradigm. Fundamentally, biolinguistics challenges the view of human language acquisition as a behavior based on stimulus-response interactions and associations.<ref>DEMIREZEN, Mehmet (1988). \"Behaviorist theory and language learning\".

Chomsky in 1960s proposed [[Language acquisition device|the Language Acquisition Device (LAD)]] as a hypothetical tool for language acquisition that only humans are born with. Similarly, Lenneberg (1967)<ref name=\":0\" /> formulated [[Critical period hypothesis|the Critical Period Hypothesis]], the main idea of which being that language acquisition is biologically constrained. These works were regarded as pioneers in the shaping of biolinguistic thought, in what was in effect the beginning of a change in paradigm in the study of language.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Martins |first1=Pedro Tiago |last2=Boeckx |first2=Cedric |title=What we talk about when we talk about biolinguistics |journal=Linguistics Vanguard |date=27 August 2016 |volume=2 |issue=1 |doi=10.1515/lingvan-2016-0007 }}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Darwin.jpg|thumb]]\n[[Darwinism]] inspired many researchers to study language, in particular the evolution of language, mainly by means of biology. Dating all the way back to 1821, German linguist August Scheilurer was the representative pioneer of biolinguistics, discussing the evolution of language based on Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution. Since linguistics had been believed to be a form of historical science under the influence of [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Linguistique de Paris|the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Linguistique de Paris]], speculations of the origin of language were not permitted.<ref>{{Cite book|title=New essays on the origin of language|last=Trabant|first=J\u00fcrgen|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2001|isbn=9783110849080|location=|pages=}}</ref> As a result, hardly did any prominent linguist write about the origin of language apart from American linguist [[Hugo Schuchardt]].  \n\nThe first official biolinguistic conference was organized by him in 1974, bringing together [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]], neuroscientists, linguists, and others interested in the development of language in the individual, its origins and evolution.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Boeckx|first1=Cedric|first2=Massimo|last2=Piattelli-Palmarini|year=2005|title=Language as a natural object, linguistics as a natural science.

While Professor [[Anna Maria Di Sciullo]] claims that the interdisciplinary research of biology and linguistics in the 1950s-1960s led to the rise of biolinguistics. Furthermore, Jenkins believes that biolinguistics was the outcome of transformational grammarians studying human linguistic and biological mechanism. On the other hand, linguists [[Martin Nowak]] and [[Charles Yang (linguist)|Charles Yang]] argue that biolinguistics, originating in the 1970s, is distinct transformational grammar; rather a new branch of the linguistics-biology research paradigm initiated by transformational grammar.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wu |first1=Jieqiong |title=An Overview of Researches on Biolinguistics |date=15 January 2014 |publisher=Canadian Social Science |pages=171\u2013176 |citeseerx=10.1.1.820.7700 }}</ref>\n\n==Developments==\n\n==== Darwinism ====\n\n{{Main|Darwinism}}\n\n[[File:Evolution of life (Plate (31)) BHL34392020.jpg|thumb]]\n\nDarwinism is a theory of biological evolution developed by [[Charles Darwin]], stating that all species of organisms arise and develop through the natural selection of small, inherited variations that increase the individual's ability to compete, survive, and reproduce.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Freeman |first1=R.B. |title=The Works of Charles Darwin: An Annotated Bibliographical Handlist. |date=1977 |publisher=Dawson: Folkstone. |edition=2nd}}</ref> The theory has since then been adopted and applied by many researchers and scholars into various fields of research.\nIn his book [[Descent of Man]], Darwin described how language might have evolved through natural and sexual selection, comparing birds learning to sing to infants babbling. Darwin\u2019s theory regarding the origin of language attempts to answer two important questions:\n\n* Whether individual languages undergo something like selection as they evolve, and\n* Whether selection played a role in producing the power of articulate language in humans; and, if it did, whether the selection was primarily responsible for the emergence of that power, or just one of several contributing causes.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Radick |first1=Gregory |title=Darwin on Language and Selection |journal=Selection |date=November 2002 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=7\u201312 |doi=10.1556/Select.3.2002.1.2 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fba79bb3c28862a33ce0ba3fe02896796e30eb2d }}</ref>\n\nDarwinism addressed the arguments of other researchers and scholars such as [[Max M\u00fcller]] by arguing that language use, while requiring a certain mental capacity, would also stimulate brain development, enabling long trains of thought and strengthening reasoning power. Darwin drew an extended analogy between the evolution of languages and species, noting in each domain the presence of rudiments, of crossing and blending, and of variation, and remarking on how each developed gradually through a process of struggle.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Plotkin |first1=Henry |title=Darwin Machines and the Nature of Knowledge |date=25 April 1997 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674192812}}</ref>\n\n==== Chomsky's Theories ====\n\n===== Universal Grammar and Generative Grammar =====\n{{Main|Universal grammar}}\n[[File:Noam Chomsky portrait 2015.jpg|thumb|Noam Chomsky]]\nIn the early 1950s, Chomsky constructed the five core questions of biolinguistics\n\n* What constitutes the knowledge of language? \n* How is the knowledge acquired? \n* How is the knowledge put to use? \n* What are the relevant brain mechanisms? \n* How does this knowledge evolve (in the species)?\n\nThe first three questions were elaborated upon in Chomsky\u2019s book [[The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory]], while the fourth and the fifth ones were mentioned in Lenneberg\u2019s book Biolinguistical Foundations of Language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wu |first1=JIe Qiong |title=An Overview of Researches on Biolinguistics |date=15 January 2014 |publisher=Canadian Social Science |pages=171\u2013176 |citeseerx=10.1.1.820.7700 }}</ref> In ''Aspects of the theory of Syntax'', Chomsky proposed that languages are the product of a biologically determined capacity present in all humans, located in the brain, a great deal of which must be innate, supporting his claim with the fact that speakers are capable of producing and understanding novel sentences without explicit instructions.\nChomsky proposed that the form of the grammar may merge from the mental structure afforded by the human brain and argued that formal grammatical categories such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives do not exist. The linguistic theory of [[generative grammar]] thereby proposes that sentences are generated by a subconscious set of procedures which are part of an individual\u2019s cognitive ability. These procedures are modeled through a set of formal grammatical rules which are thought to generate sentences in a language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Freidin |first1=Robert |title=Generative Grammar: Theory and its History |date=5 March 2012 |publisher=Routledge Leading Linguists |isbn=9780415541336 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nChomsky focuses on the mind of the language learner or user and proposed that internal properties of the language faculty are closely linked to the physical biology of humans. He further introduced the idea of a [[Universal Grammar]] theorized to be inherent to all human beings, referring to the initial state of the faculty of language, a biologically innate organ that helps the learner make sense of the data and build up an internal grammar.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=C\u0103linescu |first1=Mihaela |title=Chomsky's Biolinguistic Approach to Mind and Language |journal=Linguistic & Philosophical Investigations |date=1 January 2012 |volume=11 |pages=91\u201396 }}</ref> The theory suggests that all human languages are subject to universal principles or parameters that allow for different choices (values). It also contends that humans possess generative grammar, which is hard-wired into the human brain in some ways and makes it possible for young children to do the rapid and universal acquisition of speech.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Logan |first1=Robert K |title=The extended mind : the emergence of language, the human mind, and culture |date=2007 |publisher=Toronto : University of Toronto Press |isbn=9780802093035 }}</ref> Elements of linguistic variation then determine the growth of language in the individual, and variation is the result of experience, given the genetic endowment and independent principles reducing complexity.\n\n=====Language Acquisition Device=====\n\n{{Main|Language Acquisition}}\n\nProposed by Chomsky in the 1960s, the [[Language Acquisition Device]] (LAD) was purported to be an innate structure in humans which enabled language learning. Proponents\nof the LAD often quote the argument of the poverty of negative stimulus, suggesting that children rely on the LAD to develop their knowledge of a language despite not being\nexposed to a rich linguistic environment.\n\n=====Minimalist Program=====\n\n{{Main|Minimalist Program}}\n\nThe Minimalist Program (MP) was introduced by Chomsky in 1993, and it focuses on the parallel between language and the design of natural concepts. Those invested in the Minimalist Program are interested in the physics and mathematics of language and its parallels with our natural world. For example, Piatelli-Palmarini <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319193580 |title=Piatelli-Palmarini, M., & Vitello, G. (2017). \"Quantum field theory and the linguistic Minimalist Program: a remarkable isomorphism\" |accessdate=2019-04-10 }}</ref> studied the isomorphic relationship between the Minimalist Program and [[Quantum Field Theory]].\nThe Minimalist Program aims to figure out how much of the [[Principles and Parameters]] model can be taken as a result of the hypothetical optimal and computationally efficient design of the human language faculty and more developed versions of the Principles and Parameters approach in turn provide technical principles from which the minimalist program can be seen to follow.<ref>Gert Webelhuth. 1995.

Cambridge, Massachusetts: [[MIT Press]]</ref> \nThe program further aims to develop ideas involving the [[economy of derivation]] and [[economy of representation]], which had started to become an independent theory in the early 1990s, but were then still considered as peripherals of [[transformational grammar]].<ref>For a full description of the checking mechanism see [[David Adger|Adger, David]]. 2003. ''Core Syntax. A Minimalist Approach''. Oxford: Oxford University Press; and also Carnie, Andrew. 2006. ''Syntax: A Generative Introduction'', 2nd Edition. Blackwell Publishers</ref>\n\nIn a minimalist approach, there are three core components of The Faculty of Language proposed: Sensory-Motor system (SM), Conceptual-Intentional system (CI), and Narrow Syntax (NS).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Di Sciullo |display-authors=etal |first=Anna Maria|date=Winter 2010|title=The Biological Nature of Human Language|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/88c9/74fedaf9adb067941d98debad51e8c84be02.pdf|journal=Biolinguistics|volume=4|pages=|via=}}</ref> SM includes biological requisites for language production and perception, such as articulatory organs, and CI meets the biological requirements related to inference, interpretation, and reasoning, those involved in other cognitive functions. As SM and CI are finite, the main function of NS is to make it possible to produce infinite numbers of sound-meaning pairs.\n\n==== Lenneberg and the Role of Genes ====\nAnother major contributor to the field is [[Eric Lenneberg]]. In is book ''Biological Foundation of Languages'',<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last1=Lenneberg |first1=E.H. |title=Biological foundations of language |date=1967 |publisher=New York Wiley}}</ref>  Lenneberg (1967) suggests that different aspects of human biology that putatively contribute to language more than genes at play. While they are obviously essential, and while genomes are associated with specific organisms, genes do not store traits (or \u201cfaculties\u201d) in the way that linguists\u2014including Chomskyans\u2014sometimes seem to imply.\n\nContrary to the concept of the existence of a language faculty as suggested by Chomsky, Lenneberg argues that while there are specific regions and networks crucially involved in the production of language,  there is no single region to which language capacity is confined and that speech, as well as language, is not confined to the [[cerebral cortex]]. \nLenneberg considered language as a species-specific mental organ with significant biological properties. He suggested that this organ grows in the mind/brain of a child in the same way that other biological organs grow, showing that the child\u2019s path to language displays the hallmark of biological growth. According to Lenneberg, genetic mechanisms plays an important role in the development of an individual\u2019s behavior and is characterized by two aspects:\n\n* The acknowledgement of an indirect relationship between genes and traits, and; \n* The rejection of the existence of \u2018special\u2019 genes for language, that is, the rejection of the need for a specifically linguistic genotype;\n\nBased on this, Lenneberg goes on further to claim that no kind of functional principle could be stored in an individual\u2019s genes, rejecting the idea that there exist genes for specific traits, including language. In other words, that genes can contain traits. He then proposed that the way in which genes influence the general patterns of structure and function is by means of their action upon [[ontogenesis]] of genes as a causal agent which is individually the direct and unique responsible for a specific phenotype, criticizing prior hypothesis by [[Charles Goodwin (semiotician)|Charles Goodwin]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Boeckx |first1=Cedric |last2=Longa |first2=Victor M. |title=Lenneberg's Views on Language Development and Evolution and Their Relevance for Modern Biolinguistics |journal=Biolinguistics |date=2011 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=254\u2013273 |url=https://doaj.org/article/bda43b85480f4d5e9ef5d3d0dfc21fe3 |accessdate=10 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n=====Relevance of Natural Law=====\nIt is possible that the core principles of The Faculty of Language be correlated to [[natural law]]s (such as for example, the [[Fibonacci sequence]]&mdash; an array of numbers where each consecutive number is a sum of the two that precede it, see for example the discussion Uriagereka 1997 and Carnie and Medeiros 2005).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf |title=Natural Law: The Dynamics of Syntactic Representations in MP |last=Soschen |first=Alona |date=2006 |accessdate=2007-02-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221083019/http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf |archivedate=2007-02-21 }}</ref> According to the hypothesis being developed, the essential properties of language arise from nature itself: the efficient growth requirement appears everywhere, from the pattern of petals in flowers, leaf arrangements in trees and the spirals of a seashell to the structure of DNA and proportions of human head and body. Natural Law in this case would provide insight on concepts such as binary branching in syntactic trees. This would translate to thinking it in terms of taking two elements on a syntax tree and such that their sum yields another element that falls below on the given syntax tree. By adhering to this sum of two elements that precede it, provides support for binary structures. Furthermore, the possibility of ternary branching would deviate from the Fibonacci sequence and consequently wold not hold as strong support to the relevance of Natural Law in syntax.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Soschen|first=Alona|date=2008-03-25|title=On the Nature of Syntax|url=https://www.biolinguistics.eu/index.php/biolinguistics/article/view/9|journal=BIOLINGUISTICS|language=en|volume=2|issue=2-3|pages=196\u2013224|issn=1450-3417}}</ref>\n\nIf this law applies to existing systems of cognition, both in humans and non-humans, then what allows our mind to create language? Could it be that a single cycle exists, a unique component of which gives rise to our ability to construct sentences, refer to ourselves and other persons, group objects and establish relations between them, and eventually understand each other? The answer to this question will be a landmark breakthrough, not only within linguistics but in our understanding of cognition in general.\n\n==== Recent Development ====\nRecent work in [[theoretical linguistics]] and [[Cognitive science|cognitive studies]] at [[MIT]] construes human language as a highly non-redundant species-specific system. [[Noam Chomsky]]'s latest contribution to the study of language and the mind in general is his minimalist approach to syntactic representations. This effort to understand how much of language can be given a principled explanation has resulted in the [[minimalist program]].  In syntax, lexical items are merged externally, building argument representations; next, the internal merge induces movement and creates constituent structures where each is part of a larger unit. This mechanism allows people to combine words into infinite strings. If this is true, then the objective of biolinguistics is to find out as much as we can about the principles underlying mental [[recursion]].\n\n==Critiques==\nDavid Poeppel, a [[Neuroscience|neuroscientist]] and linguist, has noted that if neuroscience and linguistics are done wrong, there is a risk of \"inter-disciplinary cross-sterilization,\" arguing that there is a ''Granularity Mismatch Problem'', as different levels of representations used in linguistics and neural science lead to vague metaphors linking brain structures to linguistic components. Poeppel and Embick also introduce the ''Ontological Incommensurability Problem'', where computational processes described in linguistic theory cannot be restored to neural computational processes. Poeppel suggests that [[Neurolinguistics|neurolinguistic]] research should try to have theories of how the brain encodes linguistic information and what could be cognitively realistic computation.<ref>{{cite book | last=Poeppel | first=David | last2=Embick | first2=David | chapter=Defining the Relation Between Linguistics and Neuroscience | title=Twenty-First Century Psycholinguistics: Four Cornerstones | editor=Anne Cutler | year=2005 | publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum}}</ref>\n\nA more positive critique comes from the side of [[biosemiotics]], claiming that meaning-making begins far before the emergence of human language.<ref>[[Ekaterina Velmezova|Velmezova, Ekaterina]]; [[Kalevi Kull|Kull, Kalevi]]; Cowley, Stephen (eds.) 2015.

This suggests that language development depends on learning and detecting linguistic cues through competing general cognitive mechanisms rather than innate, language-specific mechanisms.\n\nA more recent critique of biolinguistics and 'biologism' in language sciences in general developed by Prakash Mondal shows that there are inconsistencies and categorical mismatches in any putative bridging constraints that purport to relate neurobiological structures and processes to the logical structures of language that have a cognitive-representatonal character.<ref>Mondal, Prakash. 2019: Language, Biology, and Cognition: A Critical Perspective.''[https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030237141]''.

This example provided by Chomsky is also evidence of poverty of the stimulus because this phrase is one that most likely did not exist in his environment, yet he was able to produce it.\n\nThis idea, which is a syntactic principle in UG, is called [[Dependency grammar|structure-dependency]]. Structure-dependency means that the sentence is influenced by its structure and not just the order of words.<ref name=\"Scianna\" /><ref>{{cite web |last1=Nordguist |first1=Richard |title=Structure dependency and linguistics |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/structure-dependency-grammar-1691997 |date=4 March 2019}}</ref> This ability to understand and use structure-dependency is not derived from experience and is instead a set of principles that regulate the acquisition of language.\n\n===Artificial Grammar Learning===\n[[Artificial grammar learning]] (AGL) lies in the intersection between cognitive psychology and linguistics. AGL tests are administered to evaluate humans' cognitive process and pattern-detection in a language learning context. Participants are required to learn a made-up grammar in a sterile setting and sounds, symbols, or both are used to represent\ngrammar structures. Results of AGL tests are used to gain an insight to how humans learn and interpret grammar.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Biosemiotics]]\n* [[Evolutionary psychology of language]]\n* [[Neurolinguistics]]\n* [[Origin of language]]\n* [[Origin of speech]]\n*[[Universal grammar|Universal Grammar]]\n\n===People in biolinguistics===\n\n*[[Alec Marantz]], [[NYU]]/[[MIT]]\n*[[Andrew Carnie]], [[University of Arizona]]\n*[[Anna Maria Di Sciullo]], [[University of Quebec at Montreal]]\n*[https://antoniobenitez.wixsite.com/benitez-burraco Antonio-Benitez Burraco], [[University of Seville]]\n*[https://www.icrea.cat/Web/ScientificStaff/cedric-boeckx--493 Cedric Boeckx], [[Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies|Catalan institute for Advanced Studies]]\n*[[Charles Reiss]], [[Concordia University]]\n*[[David Berlinski]], [[Discovery Institute]]\n*[[David Poeppel]], [[NYU]]\n*[[Derek Bickerton]], [[University of Hawaii]]\n*[[Marc D.

At an international meeting at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in 1971, biolinguistics was introduced as a highly interdisciplinary field,  including [[linguistics]], [[biology]], [[neuroscience]], [[psychology]], [[mathematics]], and others. By embracing the [[natural science]]s, it seeks to yield a framework through which we can understand the fundamentals of [[Language faculty|the faculty of language]]. \nBiolinguistics, also called the biolinguistic enterprise or the biolinguistic approach, is believed to have its origins in [[Noam Chomsky]]\u2019s and [[Eric Lenneberg]]\u2019s work on language acquisition that began in the 1950s as a reaction to the then-dominant behaviorist paradigm. Fundamentally, biolinguistics challenges the view of human language acquisition as a behavior based on stimulus-response interactions and associations.<ref>DEMIREZEN, Mehmet (1988). \"Behaviorist theory and language learning\".

Chomsky in 1960s proposed [[Language acquisition device|the Language Acquisition Device (LAD)]] as a hypothetical tool for language acquisition that only humans are born with. Similarly, Lenneberg (1967)<ref name=\":0\" /> formulated [[Critical period hypothesis|the Critical Period Hypothesis]], the main idea of which being that language acquisition is biologically constrained.

Darwin\u2019s theory regarding the origin of language attempts to answer two important questions:\n\n* Whether individual languages undergo something like selection as they evolve, and\n* Whether selection played a role in producing the power of articulate language in humans; and, if it did, whether the selection was primarily responsible for the emergence of that power, or just one of several contributing causes.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Radick |first1=Gregory |title=Darwin on Language and Selection |journal=Selection |date=November 2002 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=7\u201312 |doi=10.1556/Select.3.2002.1.2 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fba79bb3c28862a33ce0ba3fe02896796e30eb2d }}</ref>\n\nDarwinism addressed the arguments of other researchers and scholars such as [[Max M\u00fcller]] by arguing that language use, while requiring a certain mental capacity, would also stimulate brain development, enabling long trains of thought and strengthening reasoning power.

The linguistic theory of [[generative grammar]] thereby proposes that sentences are generated by a subconscious set of procedures which are part of an individual\u2019s cognitive ability. These procedures are modeled through a set of formal grammatical rules which are thought to generate sentences in a language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Freidin |first1=Robert |title=Generative Grammar: Theory and its History |date=5 March 2012 |publisher=Routledge Leading Linguists |isbn=9780415541336 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nChomsky focuses on the mind of the language learner or user and proposed that internal properties of the language faculty are closely linked to the physical biology of humans.

For example, Piatelli-Palmarini <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319193580 |title=Piatelli-Palmarini, M., & Vitello, G. (2017). \"Quantum field theory and the linguistic Minimalist Program: a remarkable isomorphism\" |accessdate=2019-04-10 }}</ref> studied the isomorphic relationship between the Minimalist Program and [[Quantum Field Theory]].\nThe Minimalist Program aims to figure out how much of the [[Principles and Parameters]] model can be taken as a result of the hypothetical optimal and computationally efficient design of the human language faculty and more developed versions of the Principles and Parameters approach in turn provide technical principles from which the minimalist program can be seen to follow.<ref>Gert Webelhuth. 1995.

Cambridge, Massachusetts: [[MIT Press]]</ref> \nThe program further aims to develop ideas involving the [[economy of derivation]] and [[economy of representation]], which had started to become an independent theory in the early 1990s, but were then still considered as peripherals of [[transformational grammar]].<ref>For a full description of the checking mechanism see [[David Adger|Adger, David]]. 2003. ''Core Syntax. A Minimalist Approach''. Oxford: Oxford University Press; and also Carnie, Andrew. 2006. ''Syntax: A Generative Introduction'', 2nd Edition. Blackwell Publishers</ref>\n\nIn a minimalist approach, there are three core components of The Faculty of Language proposed: Sensory-Motor system (SM), Conceptual-Intentional system (CI), and Narrow Syntax (NS).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Di Sciullo |display-authors=etal |first=Anna Maria|date=Winter 2010|title=The Biological Nature of Human Language|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/88c9/74fedaf9adb067941d98debad51e8c84be02.pdf|journal=Biolinguistics|volume=4|pages=|via=}}</ref> SM includes biological requisites for language production and perception, such as articulatory organs, and CI meets the biological requirements related to inference, interpretation, and reasoning, those involved in other cognitive functions. As SM and CI are finite, the main function of NS is to make it possible to produce infinite numbers of sound-meaning pairs.\n\n==== Lenneberg and the Role of Genes ====\nAnother major contributor to the field is [[Eric Lenneberg]]. In is book ''Biological Foundation of Languages'',<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last1=Lenneberg |first1=E.H. |title=Biological foundations of language |date=1967 |publisher=New York Wiley}}</ref>  Lenneberg (1967) suggests that different aspects of human biology that putatively contribute to language more than genes at play. While they are obviously essential, and while genomes are associated with specific organisms, genes do not store traits (or \u201cfaculties\u201d) in the way that linguists\u2014including Chomskyans\u2014sometimes seem to imply.\n\nContrary to the concept of the existence of a language faculty as suggested by Chomsky, Lenneberg argues that while there are specific regions and networks crucially involved in the production of language,  there is no single region to which language capacity is confined and that speech, as well as language, is not confined to the [[cerebral cortex]]. \nLenneberg considered language as a species-specific mental organ with significant biological properties. He suggested that this organ grows in the mind/brain of a child in the same way that other biological organs grow, showing that the child\u2019s path to language displays the hallmark of biological growth. According to Lenneberg, genetic mechanisms plays an important role in the development of an individual\u2019s behavior and is characterized by two aspects:\n\n* The acknowledgement of an indirect relationship between genes and traits, and; \n* The rejection of the existence of \u2018special\u2019 genes for language, that is, the rejection of the need for a specifically linguistic genotype;\n\nBased on this, Lenneberg goes on further to claim that no kind of functional principle could be stored in an individual\u2019s genes, rejecting the idea that there exist genes for specific traits, including language. In other words, that genes can contain traits. He then proposed that the way in which genes influence the general patterns of structure and function is by means of their action upon [[ontogenesis]] of genes as a causal agent which is individually the direct and unique responsible for a specific phenotype, criticizing prior hypothesis by [[Charles Goodwin (semiotician)|Charles Goodwin]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Boeckx |first1=Cedric |last2=Longa |first2=Victor M. |title=Lenneberg's Views on Language Development and Evolution and Their Relevance for Modern Biolinguistics |journal=Biolinguistics |date=2011 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=254\u2013273 |url=https://doaj.org/article/bda43b85480f4d5e9ef5d3d0dfc21fe3 |accessdate=10 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n=====Relevance of Natural Law=====\nIt is possible that the core principles of The Faculty of Language be correlated to [[natural law]]s (such as for example, the [[Fibonacci sequence]]&mdash; an array of numbers where each consecutive number is a sum of the two that precede it, see for example the discussion Uriagereka 1997 and Carnie and Medeiros 2005).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf |title=Natural Law: The Dynamics of Syntactic Representations in MP |last=Soschen |first=Alona |date=2006 |accessdate=2007-02-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221083019/http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf |archivedate=2007-02-21 }}</ref> According to the hypothesis being developed, the essential properties of language arise from nature itself: the efficient growth requirement appears everywhere, from the pattern of petals in flowers, leaf arrangements in trees and the spirals of a seashell to the structure of DNA and proportions of human head and body. Natural Law in this case would provide insight on concepts such as binary branching in syntactic trees. This would translate to thinking it in terms of taking two elements on a syntax tree and such that their sum yields another element that falls below on the given syntax tree. By adhering to this sum of two elements that precede it, provides support for binary structures. Furthermore, the possibility of ternary branching would deviate from the Fibonacci sequence and consequently wold not hold as strong support to the relevance of Natural Law in syntax.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Soschen|first=Alona|date=2008-03-25|title=On the Nature of Syntax|url=https://www.biolinguistics.eu/index.php/biolinguistics/article/view/9|journal=BIOLINGUISTICS|language=en|volume=2|issue=2-3|pages=196\u2013224|issn=1450-3417}}</ref>\n\nIf this law applies to existing systems of cognition, both in humans and non-humans, then what allows our mind to create language? Could it be that a single cycle exists, a unique component of which gives rise to our ability to construct sentences, refer to ourselves and other persons, group objects and establish relations between them, and eventually understand each other? The answer to this question will be a landmark breakthrough, not only within linguistics but in our understanding of cognition in general.\n\n==== Recent Development ====\nRecent work in [[theoretical linguistics]] and [[Cognitive science|cognitive studies]] at [[MIT]] construes human language as a highly non-redundant species-specific system. [[Noam Chomsky]]'s latest contribution to the study of language and the mind in general is his minimalist approach to syntactic representations. This effort to understand how much of language can be given a principled explanation has resulted in the [[minimalist program]].  In syntax, lexical items are merged externally, building argument representations; next, the internal merge induces movement and creates constituent structures where each is part of a larger unit. This mechanism allows people to combine words into infinite strings. If this is true, then the objective of biolinguistics is to find out as much as we can about the principles underlying mental [[recursion]].\n\n==Critiques==\nDavid Poeppel, a [[Neuroscience|neuroscientist]] and linguist, has noted that if neuroscience and linguistics are done wrong, there is a risk of \"inter-disciplinary cross-sterilization,\" arguing that there is a ''Granularity Mismatch Problem'', as different levels of representations used in linguistics and neural science lead to vague metaphors linking brain structures to linguistic components. Poeppel and Embick also introduce the ''Ontological Incommensurability Problem'', where computational processes described in linguistic theory cannot be restored to neural computational processes. Poeppel suggests that [[Neurolinguistics|neurolinguistic]] research should try to have theories of how the brain encodes linguistic information and what could be cognitively realistic computation.<ref>{{cite book | last=Poeppel | first=David | last2=Embick | first2=David | chapter=Defining the Relation Between Linguistics and Neuroscience | title=Twenty-First Century Psycholinguistics: Four Cornerstones | editor=Anne Cutler | year=2005 | publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum}}</ref>\n\nA more positive critique comes from the side of [[biosemiotics]], claiming that meaning-making begins far before the emergence of human language.<ref>[[Ekaterina Velmezova|Velmezova, Ekaterina]]; [[Kalevi Kull|Kull, Kalevi]]; Cowley, Stephen (eds.) 2015.

Cham: Springer.</ref>\n\nDeveloped by Elizabeth Wates and Brian MacWhinney, the [[Competition Model]] views language acquisition as a process consisting of a series of competitive cognitive processes that act upon an analog linguistic signal. This suggests that language development depends on learning and detecting linguistic cues through competing general cognitive mechanisms rather than innate, language-specific mechanisms.\n\nA more recent critique of biolinguistics and 'biologism' in language sciences in general developed by Prakash Mondal shows that there are inconsistencies and categorical mismatches in any putative bridging constraints that purport to relate neurobiological structures and processes to the logical structures of language that have a cognitive-representatonal character.<ref>Mondal, Prakash. 2019: Language, Biology, and Cognition: A Critical Perspective.''[https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030237141]''.

This human biological endowment for language acquisition is known as [[Universal Grammar|Universal Grammar (UG)]], which is also considered as the initial state of the Language Acquisition Device.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Crain |first1=Stephen |last2=Koring |first2=Loes |last3=Thornton |first3=Rosalind |title=Language acquisition from a biolinguistic perspective |journal=Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews |date=2017 |volume=81 |issue=Pt B |pages=120\u2013149 |doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2016.09.004|pmid=27633153 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Berwick |first1=Robert C. |last2=Chomsky |first2=Noam |title=Why only us: Language and evolution |date=2016 |publisher=The MIT Press |location=Cambridge, MA |isbn=9780262034241 |pages=89\u2013108}}</ref> UG contains core principles that are common to all languages and information on the ways that each language differs, and information on the language variations are encoded in parameters.

In other words, children have only heard a finite number of sentences, but they are able to comprehend and produce an infinite number of sentences. This argument is often used to argue against the [[usage-based linguistics|usage-based]] approach of language acquisition, which denies the necessity of UG and argues children can learn languages through their general cognitive and social skills,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tomasello|first=Michael|date=2005-01-12|title=Beyond formalities: The case of language acquisition|journal=The Linguistic Review|volume=22|issue=2\u20134|doi=10.1515/tlir.2005.22.2-4.183|issn=0167-6318}}</ref> as it is able to account for the use of grammar that the child is not exposed to.\n\nIn the following sections, some of the aspects of language that develop will be discussed from a biolinguistic stand-point. These areas will draw similarities to language acquisition and UG.\n\n===Typology===\n\n{{Main|Linguistic typology}}\n\nLinguistic typology is the analysis, comparison, and classification of languages according to their common structural features and forms.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Nordguist |first1=Richard |title=Linguistic typology |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-linguistic-typology-1691129 |date=19 February 2019}}</ref> Linguistic typology studies and classifies languages according to their structural features, and it aims to describe and explain the structural diversity and similarity in the languages of the world.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=English Language and Linguistics Online |title=Linguistic typology & typological universals |url=http://www.ello.uos.de/field.php/CognitiveApproaches/LinguisticTypologyAndTypologicalUniversals}}</ref>\n\nThe study of linguistic typology is thus in line with the goal of biolinguists in language acquisition as mentioned previously. It also draws comparisons with UG in the sense that they both seek to identify the similarities and differences in the languages of the world. There is some evidence from this field that suggests that the structure of the world's languages may not be completely random from a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistc]] point of view <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Trudgill |first1=Peter |title=The impact of language contact and social structure on linguistic structure: Focus on the dialects of modern Greek |journal=Dialectology Meets Typology: Dialect Grammar from a Cross-linguistic Perspective |date=2004 |volume=153 |pages=435\u2013452}}</ref> and this supports the view of UG.\n\nSome of the areas that linguistic typology looks at are:\n*[[Phonology|Phonological systems]]\n*Word order\n*[[Morphosyntactic alignment]]\n*Semantics<ref>Kemp, Charles & Xu, Yang & Regier, Terry (2018). \"Semantic Typology and Efficient Communication\".

'''4''': 109-128.</ref>\n\n===Syntax===\n\n{{Main|Syntax}}\n\nSyntax is the part of the language that includes the rules that govern the grammatical organization of words and phrases. [[Generative grammar]] considers it the central object of the study and this is the only component of the human language that allows for creative properties.<ref name=Scianna>{{cite journal |last1=Scianna |first1=Caterina |title=The biolinguistic approach to the study of language nature |url=https://www.academia.edu/8452191}}</ref> It is because of this creativity allowed by syntax that provided the phrase, famously used by Chomsky, ''[[Colourless green ideas sleep furiously]]'' in his book [[Syntactic Structures]] which demonstrated a grammatically correct phrase that made no sense. This example provided by Chomsky is also evidence of poverty of the stimulus because this phrase is one that most likely did not exist in his environment, yet he was able to produce it.\n\nThis idea, which is a syntactic principle in UG, is called [[Dependency grammar|structure-dependency]]. Structure-dependency means that the sentence is influenced by its structure and not just the order of words.<ref name=\"Scianna\" /><ref>{{cite web |last1=Nordguist |first1=Richard |title=Structure dependency and linguistics |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/structure-dependency-grammar-1691997 |date=4 March 2019}}</ref> This ability to understand and use structure-dependency is not derived from experience and is instead a set of principles that regulate the acquisition of language.\n\n===Artificial Grammar Learning===\n[[Artificial grammar learning]] (AGL) lies in the intersection between cognitive psychology and linguistics. AGL tests are administered to evaluate humans' cognitive process and pattern-detection in a language learning context. Participants are required to learn a made-up grammar in a sterile setting and sounds, symbols, or both are used to represent\ngrammar structures. Results of AGL tests are used to gain an insight to how humans learn and interpret grammar.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Biosemiotics]]\n* [[Evolutionary psychology of language]]\n* [[Neurolinguistics]]\n* [[Origin of language]]\n* [[Origin of speech]]\n*[[Universal grammar|Universal Grammar]]\n\n===People in biolinguistics===\n\n*[[Alec Marantz]], [[NYU]]/[[MIT]]\n*[[Andrew Carnie]], [[University of Arizona]]\n*[[Anna Maria Di Sciullo]], [[University of Quebec at Montreal]]\n*[https://antoniobenitez.wixsite.com/benitez-burraco Antonio-Benitez Burraco], [[University of Seville]]\n*[https://www.icrea.cat/Web/ScientificStaff/cedric-boeckx--493 Cedric Boeckx], [[Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies|Catalan institute for Advanced Studies]]\n*[[Charles Reiss]], [[Concordia University]]\n*[[David Berlinski]], [[Discovery Institute]]\n*[[David Poeppel]], [[NYU]]\n*[[Derek Bickerton]], [[University of Hawaii]]\n*[[Marc D.

The population was 10,371 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].<ref name=\"Census 2010\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov |title=Race, Hispanic or Latino, Age, and Housing Occupancy: 2010 Census Redistricting Data (Public Law 94-171) Summary File (QT-PL), Grosse Ile township, Wayne County, Michigan |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=September 8, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe township encompasses several islands in the [[Detroit River]], of which the largest is named as [[Grosse Ile (Michigan)|Grosse Ile]].  Named by French explorers in 1679,  ''Grosse \u00cele'' means \"Big Island\". Later taken under British rule after 1763, the island was not settled by European Americans until after the United States achieved independence in the [[American Revolutionary War]].\n\n==Geography==\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the township has a total area of {{convert|18.67|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|9.20|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|9.47|sqmi|sqkm|2}} (50.72%) is water.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-24.pdf|format=PDF |title=Michigan: 2010 Population and Housing Unit Counts 2010 Census of Population and Housing | date = September 2012|publisher = [[United States Census Bureau]]| work = [[2010 United States Census]]| accessdate = April 12, 2020|page=44 Michigan}}</ref>\n\nGrosse Ile is the largest [[List of islands in the Detroit River|island on the Detroit River]]. The township of Grosse Ile is composed of twelve islands, although the community is most often identified with the main island (which residents simply refer to as \"The Island\"). Grosse Ile's main island is technically composed of two islands.  Grosse Ile Township is one of only seven municipalities in the state of Michigan to consist entirely of islands, including [[St. James Township, Michigan|St. James Township]], [[Drummond Township, Michigan|Drummond Township]], [[Bois Blanc Township, Michigan|Bois Blanc Township]], [[Mackinac Island, Michigan|Mackinac Island]], [[Peaine Township, Michigan|Peaine Township]], and [[Sugar Island Township, Michigan|Sugar Island Township]].\n\nThe tip of the main island's northern section is named Hennepin Point in honor of the 17th-century French explorer Father [[Louis Hennepin]]. It is uninhabited and separated from the remainder of the northern section by an unnamed canal that cannot be navigated in a power boat.\n\nThe southern section of the main island is separated from the northern section by the Thorofare Canal, which runs on a diagonal course from east to west connecting the main channel of the [[Detroit River]] with the Trenton Channel of the river. The southern section of the main island is connected by bridges to Elba Island, Meso Island (also known as Upper Hickory Island), Hickory Island, and Swan Island, which are all inhabited.\n[[File:Grosse Ile Toll Bridge in 2006.jpg|thumb|Grosse Ile Toll Bridge]]\n\nNot far from the shoreline of the main island in the river lie Calf Island, Celeron Island (charted as Tawas Island), Dynamite (also known as Powder House Island), Fox Island, Stony Island, and [[Sugar Island (Detroit River)|Sugar Island]], which are all uninhabited. Stony and Celeron are owned by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. Calf Island is owned by the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] as a part of the [http://www.fws.gov/midwest/detroitriver/ Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge]. The other islands are privately owned.  The low-lying [[Mamajuda Island]] is off the northeastern tip of Grosse Ile and is visible only during times of low water level.\n\nTwo bridges connect the main island to the mainland of Michigan.  The bridge on the north end of the island is called the [[Grosse Ile Toll Bridge]] (off-white color).  The bridge on the south end of the island is officially named the [[Wayne County Bridge]] (light green in color), but is commonly called the \"Free Bridge\" by locals.\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2010}}\n\n===Founding and early times===\nThe [[Potawatomi]] occupied areas of the island, which they called ''Kitcheminishen'', and areas in this region for a long period prior to European encounter. They were one of the tribes in the Council of Three Fires.\n\nThe flags of three nations\u2014France, England, and the United States\u2014have flown over Detroit and Grosse Ile since the first French explorers visited the island during the late 17th century. The early French explorers named the island as ''la grosse \u00eele''\u2014the \"big island\" in French. Father [[Louis Hennepin]], a Catholic priest and missionary, accompanied fellow French explorer [[Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]] in 1679 on the ship ''[[Le Griffon]]'' in exploring the [[Great Lakes]].  The Sacred Heart [[Roman Catholic Church]] on Grosse Ile says that Father Hennepin came ashore and said mass at a location on the east shore of the island near the present site of St. Anne's Chapel. No record exists of this event, but Father Hennepin wrote in his journals about the fruit orchards and wild animals on Grosse Ile, showing he was here. The north end of Grosse Ile is named Hennepin Point in his honor.\n\nFrench explorer [[Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac]] and his convoy of 25 canoes sailed down the Detroit River and camped on the shore of Grosse Ile during the evening of July 23, 1701.  On the morning of July 24, Cadillac returned upriver and landed ashore, where he claimed French possession of the territory under the authority of [[King Louis XIV]]. This site is in present-day Detroit, near the present intersection of West Jefferson and Shelby streets.\n\nGrosse Ile maintained its own name and identity as a community through the 18th century. The British established control of the island and present-day Michigan in 1763 after their victory in the [[French and Indian War]]. They anglicized the spelling to \"Grosse Isle\".\n\nAlthough the Potawatomi, like most [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], did not have the same sense of property ownership as did Europeans and Americans, they considered the island to be part of their ancestral lands. On July 6, 1776, they deeded the island to brothers [[Alexander Macomb (merchant)|Alexander]] and [[William Macomb (merchant)|William Macomb]], brothers from Albany who had become leading fur traders and merchants in [[Detroit]], partly from selling supplies to the British at Fort Detroit and the local Indian Department. They were so successful that they added a partner for their Detroit trade.<ref name=dill/>\n\n(Alexander Macomb later returned to New York, settling in New York City. He became wealthy from land speculation in southern states. He lost his fortune after buying nearly 4 million acres of land in upstate New York in the postwar period and not being able to resell it rapidly enough.)<ref name=dill>[http://www.mlloyd.org/gen/macomb/text/amsr/wt.htm  David B. Dill Jr. \"Portrait of an Opportunist: The Life of Alexander Macomb\"], ''[[Watertown Daily Times]],'' (September 9, 1990). First of a 3-part series</ref>\n\nThe Macomb brothers likely believed that by purchasing this deed through the transfer of items of value, they had obtained full ownership rights. They are considered to be the founders of the European-American community on the island and the first legal owners of Grosse Ile.\n\n===Settlement to present===\nSettlement started in the 19th century. At least three homes still standing on the island were built during this period by a descendant or relative of the Macomb brothers. The Rucker Homestead, the oldest structure in use on Grosse Ile, has portions that date to 1816. The front structure was added by John Anthony Rucker in 1835.<ref>\"Grosse Ile: A Historical Timeline\"</ref> The [[Rucker-Stanton House]] on West River Road was built in 1848 by the great-grandson of William Macomb. The Wendell House on East River Road was built in the late 1860s by John Wendell, who married a granddaughter of William Macomb.\n\nWestcroft Gardens, a Michigan Centennial Farm located on West River Road, is operated by descendants of the Macombs.  Westcroft, which is open to the public, features a nursery well known for growing and selling hybrid [[azalea]]s and [[rhododendron]]s. Westcroft is one of the oldest farms in Michigan still owned by the same family. Most of the original buildings at Westcroft Gardens are still standing and well preserved.\n\nMacomb Street of the central business district of Grosse Ile was named in honor of the New York brothers. A monument commemorating the day that the tribal chiefs and elders signed the deed to the Macomb brothers is located at the foot of Gray's Drive and near the shoreline of the [[Detroit River]]. The original deed, which was written on [[parchment]], is stored in the [[Burton Historical Collection]] at the [[Detroit Public Library]].\n\n===Trenton Channel and boating===\n[[File:Grosse Ile waterfront.jpg|thumb|A section of Grosse Ile waterfront]]\nBoating has been both a means of transportation and recreation since the first residents lived on the island.  Native Americans used [[canoe]]s to travel between Grosse Ile's islands and the mainland in Michigan and Canada.  Early European settlers primarily used [[sailboat|sail-powered vessels]] to travel to and from the islands.\n\nBy the late 19th century, Grosse Ile was known as a popular destination for recreational boaters. It was also served by steamboats operating from Detroit and small towns along the river and lakes. During this time period Sugar Island, which is one of the twelve islands commonly considered to comprise Grosse Ile, featured an amusement park, dance pavilion, and bathing beach. [[Paddle steamer]]s regularly carried people from Detroit and other points along the Michigan side of the Detroit River to Sugar Island.\n\nDuring this era and into the early 20th century, a number of wealthy residents from Detroit and other nearby towns built summer homes along the shoreline (mainly on the southern end) of Grosse Ile in order to enjoy views of the Detroit River or [[Lake Erie]].  The interior section of the island was sparsely populated, as most of the land was undeveloped woodlands or part of farms.  The residential population of Grosse Ile totaled 802 at the 1920 [[U.S. Census]]. The majority of houses were located around the perimeter of the island and main roads crossed the community chiefly in either a north\u2013south or east\u2013west direction.\n\nIn 1894, the federal government funded and constructed a series of channel [[range light]]s to assist ships to avoid shallow areas in the Detroit River and its shoreline.  The northernmost of the channel range lights was the Grosse Ile Light, which is now the only lighthouse remaining on the island.  The original 1894 Grosse Ile lighthouse resembled a [[water tower]] on stilts, as it was constructed on wooden pilings along with a {{convert|170|ft|adj=on}} walkway to shore.\n\nIt was rebuilt in 1906 and designed as the classic white structure that has become one of the iconic landmarks on the island. The lighthouse is considered a symbol of Grosse Ile; its image is used on the masthead of the ''Ile Camera'' community newspaper and many other places.  The lighthouse's beacon was turned off in the 1940s, and the structure is no longer an important navigation aid for [[lake freighter]]s. Small boaters still refer to the lighthouse in their navigation of the area.\n\nIn 1965, the Grosse Ile Township purchased the lighthouse from the [[U.S. Department of the Interior]] for $350, with funds provided by the Grosse Ile Historical Society (GIHS). The GIHS was given the responsibility to preserve and maintain the lighthouse.  The GIHS annually holds a tour of the lighthouse during a weekend each fall, which is the only time of the year that it is open to the public.\n\nIsland resident Cameron Waterman invented the [[outboard motor]] and successfully tested his invention during February 1905 in the ice-filled Detroit River off the shore of Grosse Ile. He established the Waterman Marine Motor Company in Detroit.  The company eventually manufactured and sold up to 1,000 outboard motors per year until Waterman sold the business in 1917.  During the fall of 2005, the GIHS celebrated the 100th anniversary of Waterman's invention by hosting a public exhibition featuring fully restored Waterman outboard motors. These are highly collectible and very rare.\n\nDuring the [[Prohibition era]], Grosse Ile became a crossing point for [[rum-running|bootleg]]gers illegally smuggling alcoholic beverages from [[Canada]]. They typically arrived at the island via small speed boats.  During the winter months, some daring [[smuggling|smugglers]] drove cars across the frozen river.\n\n===Aviation and military===\n[[File:NAS Grosse Ile NAN2-47.jpg|thumb|Naval Air Station]]\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, a small airport on the southern end of Grosse Ile was the location of historic early aviation activities.  The [[Curtiss-Wright]] Flying Service operated a flying school at the airport.  The Aircraft Development Corporation built the world's first all-metal [[airship]], the [[ZMC-2]], for the Navy in a large hangar. [[Amelia Earhart]] is rumored to have stopped at the airfield on occasion.\n\nGrosse Ile was the home of a [[U.S. Navy]] base for forty years. The [http://nasgi.org U.S. Naval Air Station Grosse Ile] opened in 1929 after three years of construction of [[seaplane]] and [[dirigible]] facilities.  During [[World War II]], the naval base developed into an important center for military [[flight training]]. The base was expanded considerably to accommodate large numbers of American and British fliers who trained on the island. As a young man during WWII, [[George H. W. Bush]] was stationed at the base for training during 1945 for about two months. He later became a politician and President of the United States.\n\nDuring the height of the [[Cold War]], in 1954 the [[U.S. Army]] installed an [[Project Nike|Ajax-Nike missile]] base at the airfield; it was functional until being decommissioned in 1963. The Navy closed the base during November 1969. The federal government transferred it in 1971 to the township government for civilian use as a municipal airport.\n\nToday, the [[Grosse Ile Municipal Airport]] is used primarily for general aviation. It has also been the site of public airshows. Occasionally it serves as a temporary docking area for [[blimp]]s that visit southeastern Michigan to fly over major sporting events. The United States [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (USEPA) operates the Large Lakes Research Station in one of the buildings on the airport grounds. The airport campus is also the site of [http://www.grosseile.com Grosse Ile Township Hall], which was moved to this location in 2000 from Macomb Street, and a number of private businesses.\n\n===Railroads and bridges===\n\nIn 1873 the Canada Southern Bridge Company, a subsidiary of the [[Canada Southern Railroad Company]], established a railroad from the Michigan mainland to the island that carried both passengers and freight.  The company laid tracks across Grosse Ile and built bridges over the Detroit River to enable trains to be transferred to a ferryboat on Stony Island (one of the islands near the east shoreline of Grosse Ile's \"main island\").  Once on the ferryboat, the train cars were taken to [[Ontario, Canada]] across the river, where they were put back on a rail track to travel to [[Buffalo, New York]] and other points east.  Canada Southern operated trains on this route for about ten years before ceasing service due to financial difficulties.\n\nAfter Canada Southern ended its operations, the [[Michigan Central Railroad]] (MCR) operated a train that provided service between the island and [[Trenton, Michigan]]. From Trenton, travelers could connect with trains or streetcars to Detroit and other cities in the region. In 1904, the Michigan Central Railroad built a small brick and stone depot along the tracks near East River Road on the east side of the island.\n\nTrain service peaked during the early 20th century, but rapidly declined after [[Edward W. Voigt]]'s [[Grosse Ile Bridge Company]] opened the [[Grosse Ile Toll Bridge]] for automobile traffic on November 27, 1913 (Thanksgiving Day).  The bridge, which is privately owned, is on the west side of the island and connects to the city of [[Riverview, Michigan|Riverview]]. After automobile traffic crossing the bridge became the most popular means of traveling to and from the island, the Michigan Central Railroad ceased daily passenger service in early 1924; in 1929 it ended its occasional freight service.\n\nDuring 1931, the county government converted the Michigan Central Railroad's defunct rail bridge crossing the Trenton Channel into the [[Wayne County Bridge]] for use by vehicular, bike and pedestrian traffic.  The rail tracks across the island were replaced by a roadway that is now known as Grosse Ile Parkway.  The Wayne County Bridge is commonly referred to as the \"Free Bridge\" by residents because of it does not charge a toll.\n\nToday, about three-quarters of the vehicle traffic going to and from Grosse Ile travels over the Wayne County Bridge, while one-quarter crosses the Toll Bridge.  The Toll Bridge has been hit twice by [[lake freighter]]s, causing it to close temporarily (in 1965 and in 1992).  The Wayne County Bridge was closed to vehicle traffic for major renovations between May 2, 2007, and December 21, 2007.  During the 2007 county bridge closure period, the Toll Bridge provided the only route for vehicles to travel to and from the island.\n\n===Grosse Ile Historic District===\nToday, the MCR train depot is owned and operated as a community museum by the Gross Ile Historic Society (GIHS). Nearby is the old [[U.S. Customs House (Grosse Ile, Michigan)|U.S. Customs House]], which was relocated to the current site in 1980 from Macomb Street. The GIHS also owns the Custom House, and these are the only structures in the [[National Historic Landmark District|National Historic District]] along East River Road that are regularly open to the public. The district features Saint James [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]], the oldest church building on the island, constructed during 1867 in part with funds provided by a freed slave named [[Lisette Denison Forth|Elizabeth Denison]].  The district includes six homes, built from the 1840s to 1860s, that are outstanding examples of period architecture, particularly [[Gothic Revival]] and [[Jacobethan]] Revival.\n\n===Modern times, growth and preservation===\n\nGrosse Ile has good views of commercial shipping and [[pleasure boat]] traffic on the Detroit River.  Lake freighters and oceangoing ships traveling to destinations around the Great Lakes regularly pass near the east side of the island, where the main channel of the Detroit River separates Grosse Ile from Ontario, Canada.\n\nWhile the shoreline areas of Grosse Ile feature the majority of historically significant places and structures, approximately a dozen 1920s-era homes in the Jewell Colony subdivision, located in the middle of the island, are listed on the Michigan Register of Historic Places. Jewell Colony was the first planned subdivision on the island.\n\nDuring the later 20th century, Grosse Ile had a significant increase in the rate of residential development, given its advantageous location and other amenities. By the 1980 census, the population of Grosse Ile had increased to approximately 9,300\u2014 about 106% over its population in the 1960 census.\n\nFearing the destruction of the natural character and small-town charm of the community, during the early 1990s the Grosse Ile Township established an \"Open Space Program\", to be funded by a voter-approved dedicated local property tax to buy undeveloped land. The township acquired large tracts of environmentally sensitive land to slow the pace of development, preserve the environment, and protect housing values.\n\nIn 1993, a group of residents established a 501(c)(3) [[non-profit organization]] named the Grosse Ile Land & Nature Conservancy, to aid in the protection and stewardship of the diverse natural resources on the island. A number of private owners donated environmentally important woodland and wetland areas to the Conservancy to protect them (and to get a tax write-off.)  \t\n\nThe U.S. EPA granted stewardship responsibilities to the Conservancy for a {{convert|40.5|acre|adj=on}} marsh and upland area on the federally owned section of the Grosse Ile Municipal Airport. This tract of land, which at one time was the location of the Navy's seaplane base and later the Army's Nike missile base, has been restored to its natural state; it features rich biodiversity and rare coastal wetlands. Named the Nature Area by the Conservancy, this land is periodically used by local teachers and [[Scouting in Michigan|Boy Scout groups]] to teach children about nature and the importance of conservation.\t\t\n\nGrosse Ile is a community of about 10,371 residents.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/> ''Money'' magazine ranked Grosse Ile as one of the \"Top 100 Best Places to Live\" in 2009.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/bplive/2009/snapshots/PL2635440.html|title=Best Places to Live 2009 - Top 100: Grosse Ile, MI|date=07-13-09|magazine=Money Magazine|accessdate=2009-07-14}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Grosse Ile, MI township hall.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Grosse Ile Township Hall]]\nThe annual \"Islandfest\" (formerly \"[[Azalea]] Festival\") takes place around Grosse Ile Municipal Airport. On the same site as Islandfest, the Grosse Ile Youth Recreational Association (GIYRA), a 501c3 charity, runs a [[haunted house]] every [[Halloween]]. GIYRA coordinates the youth sporting events for the island children. The sports offered by GIYRA are Football and Cheer, Flag Football, Basketball, Baseball and Softball.\n\nThe island has an indoor tennis facility: six courts inside an old hangar at the city's municipal airport. New ownership has taken over the Tennis Center; they have refinished the courts and are conducting other renovations.<!-- year? -->{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nThe Grosse Ile Soccer Association coordinates the township's soccer league. The rapidly expanding soccer association, which started by hosting a recreational league, has expanded into a larger association. The Grosse Ile Soccer Association has more than 15 select travel / premier level teams on top of the in-house recreational program.\n\nGrosse Ile's community theatre, The Islanders, is Downriver's oldest theatre club and one of the oldest civic theatre groups in the state of Michigan. The club has been active on Grosse Ile since 1925, when friends and neighbors developed a means of entertainment during the long Michigan winters. The first major play was produced on May 21, 1926, by a group of 40 founding members.\n\nThe Grosse Ile High School Robotics Team, 'The Wired Devils', is the island's first robotics team. It is part of the larger community of FIRST teams in Michigan as a whole. The team has grown to more than fifty members since its founding in 2014.\n\nGrosse Ile social clubs include the Grosse Ile Yacht Club, the Ford Yacht Club, the Elba-Mar Boat Club, the Grosse Ile Golf and Country Club, West Shore Golf Course, Water's Edge Golf Course, the Kiwanis Club of Grosse Ile, and the Grosse Ile Rotary Club (founded in 1947).\n\n==Education==\n[[Grosse Ile Township Schools]] serves the township.\n\nOn the island, there are two elementary schools: Parke Lane Elementary which serves grades K-2nd, and Meridian Elementary which serves grades 3rd-5th. The Grosse Ile Middle School enrolls students in 6\u20138, and [[Grosse Ile High School]] provides college preparatory education for grades 9\u201312.  Their mascot is the Red Devil. In 1999 the former middle school was demolished in favor of a new and more up-to-date building. In the process, the historic adjacent school, built in 1911, was demolished amid much controversy. The controversy centered around the desire of many township residents to preserve a historic structure in which many lifelong residents had received their education, and had been the original school building for the island as well.\n\nIn 2001, Grosse Ile was ranked the highest out of 88 school districts in Michigan by ''[[The Detroit News]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.detnews.com/specialreports/2001/reportcard/index.htm|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120728004704/http://www.detnews.com/specialreports/2001/reportcard/index.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 28, 2012|title=Scoring Metro Districts|date=March 4, 2001|newspaper=The Detroit News|accessdate=2009-01-22}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\nThe [[U.S. Census Bureau]] also defined Grosse Ile Township as a [[census-designated place]] (CDP) in the 2000 Census so that the community would appear on the list of places (like cities and villages) as well on the list of county subdivisions (like other townships).  The final statistics for the township and the CDP were identical.\n\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 10,894 people, 4,122 households, and 3,293 families residing in the township.  The [[population density]] was 1,133.9 persons per square mile (437.7/km\u00b2).  There were 4,335 housing units at an average density of 451.2 per square mile (174.2/km\u00b2).  The racial makeup of the township was 95.23% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 0.36% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.34% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 2.74% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.04% [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]], 0.29% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 1.00% from two or more races. [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 1.61% of the population.\n\nThere were 4,122 households out of which 34.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 72.8% were married couples living together, 5.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 20.1% were non-families. 17.8% of all households were made up of individuals and 7.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.  The average household size was 2.64 and the average family size was 2.99.\n\nIn the township the population was spread out with 24.9% under the age of 18, 5.1% from 18 to 24, 23.4% from 25 to 44, 34.8% from 45 to 64, and 11.9% who were 65 years of age or older.  The median age was 43 years. For every 100 females, there were 99.6 males.  For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 97.0 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the township was $87,062, and the median income for a family was $96,226. Males had a median income of $71,777 versus $42,430 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the township was $42,150.  About 1.9% of families and 2.6% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 3.4% of those under age 18 and 2.6% of those age 65 or over.\n\nThe township is considered to be among the safest communities in Michigan.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pub.umich.edu/daily/1997/oct/10-06-97/news/news9.html |title=Grosse Ile ranked safest |date=June 10, 1997 |publisher=The Michigan Daily Online |accessdate=2009-01-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824105841/http://www.pub.umich.edu/daily/1997/oct/10-06-97/news/news9.html |archivedate=August 24, 2007 }}</ref> It is highly affluent and is isolated in the river, with two bridges connecting it to the mainland.\n\n==Notable residents==\n<!-- This is more detail than usual - why is this justified for these notable residents alone?

Named by French explorers in 1679,  ''Grosse \u00cele'' means \"Big Island\". Later taken under British rule after 1763, the island was not settled by European Americans until after the United States achieved independence in the [[American Revolutionary War]].\n\n==Geography==\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the township has a total area of {{convert|18.67|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|9.20|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|9.47|sqmi|sqkm|2}} (50.72%) is water.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-24.pdf|format=PDF |title=Michigan: 2010 Population and Housing Unit Counts 2010 Census of Population and Housing | date = September 2012|publisher = [[United States Census Bureau]]| work = [[2010 United States Census]]| accessdate = April 12, 2020|page=44 Michigan}}</ref>\n\nGrosse Ile is the largest [[List of islands in the Detroit River|island on the Detroit River]]. The township of Grosse Ile is composed of twelve islands, although the community is most often identified with the main island (which residents simply refer to as \"The Island\"). Grosse Ile's main island is technically composed of two islands.  Grosse Ile Township is one of only seven municipalities in the state of Michigan to consist entirely of islands, including [[St. James Township, Michigan|St. James Township]], [[Drummond Township, Michigan|Drummond Township]], [[Bois Blanc Township, Michigan|Bois Blanc Township]], [[Mackinac Island, Michigan|Mackinac Island]], [[Peaine Township, Michigan|Peaine Township]], and [[Sugar Island Township, Michigan|Sugar Island Township]].\n\nThe tip of the main island's northern section is named Hennepin Point in honor of the 17th-century French explorer Father [[Louis Hennepin]]. It is uninhabited and separated from the remainder of the northern section by an unnamed canal that cannot be navigated in a power boat.\n\nThe southern section of the main island is separated from the northern section by the Thorofare Canal, which runs on a diagonal course from east to west connecting the main channel of the [[Detroit River]] with the Trenton Channel of the river. The southern section of the main island is connected by bridges to Elba Island, Meso Island (also known as Upper Hickory Island), Hickory Island, and Swan Island, which are all inhabited.\n[[File:Grosse Ile Toll Bridge in 2006.jpg|thumb|Grosse Ile Toll Bridge]]\n\nNot far from the shoreline of the main island in the river lie Calf Island, Celeron Island (charted as Tawas Island), Dynamite (also known as Powder House Island), Fox Island, Stony Island, and [[Sugar Island (Detroit River)|Sugar Island]], which are all uninhabited. Stony and Celeron are owned by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. Calf Island is owned by the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] as a part of the [http://www.fws.gov/midwest/detroitriver/ Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge]. The other islands are privately owned.  The low-lying [[Mamajuda Island]] is off the northeastern tip of Grosse Ile and is visible only during times of low water level.\n\nTwo bridges connect the main island to the mainland of Michigan.  The bridge on the north end of the island is called the [[Grosse Ile Toll Bridge]] (off-white color).  The bridge on the south end of the island is officially named the [[Wayne County Bridge]] (light green in color), but is commonly called the \"Free Bridge\" by locals.\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2010}}\n\n===Founding and early times===\nThe [[Potawatomi]] occupied areas of the island, which they called ''Kitcheminishen'', and areas in this region for a long period prior to European encounter. They were one of the tribes in the Council of Three Fires.\n\nThe flags of three nations\u2014France, England, and the United States\u2014have flown over Detroit and Grosse Ile since the first French explorers visited the island during the late 17th century. The early French explorers named the island as ''la grosse \u00eele''\u2014the \"big island\" in French. Father [[Louis Hennepin]], a Catholic priest and missionary, accompanied fellow French explorer [[Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]] in 1679 on the ship ''[[Le Griffon]]'' in exploring the [[Great Lakes]].  The Sacred Heart [[Roman Catholic Church]] on Grosse Ile says that Father Hennepin came ashore and said mass at a location on the east shore of the island near the present site of St. Anne's Chapel. No record exists of this event, but Father Hennepin wrote in his journals about the fruit orchards and wild animals on Grosse Ile, showing he was here. The north end of Grosse Ile is named Hennepin Point in his honor.\n\nFrench explorer [[Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac]] and his convoy of 25 canoes sailed down the Detroit River and camped on the shore of Grosse Ile during the evening of July 23, 1701.  On the morning of July 24, Cadillac returned upriver and landed ashore, where he claimed French possession of the territory under the authority of [[King Louis XIV]]. This site is in present-day Detroit, near the present intersection of West Jefferson and Shelby streets.\n\nGrosse Ile maintained its own name and identity as a community through the 18th century. The British established control of the island and present-day Michigan in 1763 after their victory in the [[French and Indian War]]. They anglicized the spelling to \"Grosse Isle\".\n\nAlthough the Potawatomi, like most [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], did not have the same sense of property ownership as did Europeans and Americans, they considered the island to be part of their ancestral lands. On July 6, 1776, they deeded the island to brothers [[Alexander Macomb (merchant)|Alexander]] and [[William Macomb (merchant)|William Macomb]], brothers from Albany who had become leading fur traders and merchants in [[Detroit]], partly from selling supplies to the British at Fort Detroit and the local Indian Department. They were so successful that they added a partner for their Detroit trade.<ref name=dill/>\n\n(Alexander Macomb later returned to New York, settling in New York City. He became wealthy from land speculation in southern states. He lost his fortune after buying nearly 4 million acres of land in upstate New York in the postwar period and not being able to resell it rapidly enough.)<ref name=dill>[http://www.mlloyd.org/gen/macomb/text/amsr/wt.htm  David B. Dill Jr. \"Portrait of an Opportunist: The Life of Alexander Macomb\"], ''[[Watertown Daily Times]],'' (September 9, 1990). First of a 3-part series</ref>\n\nThe Macomb brothers likely believed that by purchasing this deed through the transfer of items of value, they had obtained full ownership rights. They are considered to be the founders of the European-American community on the island and the first legal owners of Grosse Ile.\n\n===Settlement to present===\nSettlement started in the 19th century. At least three homes still standing on the island were built during this period by a descendant or relative of the Macomb brothers. The Rucker Homestead, the oldest structure in use on Grosse Ile, has portions that date to 1816. The front structure was added by John Anthony Rucker in 1835.<ref>\"Grosse Ile: A Historical Timeline\"</ref> The [[Rucker-Stanton House]] on West River Road was built in 1848 by the great-grandson of William Macomb. The Wendell House on East River Road was built in the late 1860s by John Wendell, who married a granddaughter of William Macomb.\n\nWestcroft Gardens, a Michigan Centennial Farm located on West River Road, is operated by descendants of the Macombs.  Westcroft, which is open to the public, features a nursery well known for growing and selling hybrid [[azalea]]s and [[rhododendron]]s. Westcroft is one of the oldest farms in Michigan still owned by the same family. Most of the original buildings at Westcroft Gardens are still standing and well preserved.\n\nMacomb Street of the central business district of Grosse Ile was named in honor of the New York brothers. A monument commemorating the day that the tribal chiefs and elders signed the deed to the Macomb brothers is located at the foot of Gray's Drive and near the shoreline of the [[Detroit River]]. The original deed, which was written on [[parchment]], is stored in the [[Burton Historical Collection]] at the [[Detroit Public Library]].\n\n===Trenton Channel and boating===\n[[File:Grosse Ile waterfront.jpg|thumb|A section of Grosse Ile waterfront]]\nBoating has been both a means of transportation and recreation since the first residents lived on the island.  Native Americans used [[canoe]]s to travel between Grosse Ile's islands and the mainland in Michigan and Canada.  Early European settlers primarily used [[sailboat|sail-powered vessels]] to travel to and from the islands.\n\nBy the late 19th century, Grosse Ile was known as a popular destination for recreational boaters. It was also served by steamboats operating from Detroit and small towns along the river and lakes. During this time period Sugar Island, which is one of the twelve islands commonly considered to comprise Grosse Ile, featured an amusement park, dance pavilion, and bathing beach. [[Paddle steamer]]s regularly carried people from Detroit and other points along the Michigan side of the Detroit River to Sugar Island.\n\nDuring this era and into the early 20th century, a number of wealthy residents from Detroit and other nearby towns built summer homes along the shoreline (mainly on the southern end) of Grosse Ile in order to enjoy views of the Detroit River or [[Lake Erie]].  The interior section of the island was sparsely populated, as most of the land was undeveloped woodlands or part of farms.  The residential population of Grosse Ile totaled 802 at the 1920 [[U.S. Census]]. The majority of houses were located around the perimeter of the island and main roads crossed the community chiefly in either a north\u2013south or east\u2013west direction.\n\nIn 1894, the federal government funded and constructed a series of channel [[range light]]s to assist ships to avoid shallow areas in the Detroit River and its shoreline.  The northernmost of the channel range lights was the Grosse Ile Light, which is now the only lighthouse remaining on the island.  The original 1894 Grosse Ile lighthouse resembled a [[water tower]] on stilts, as it was constructed on wooden pilings along with a {{convert|170|ft|adj=on}} walkway to shore.\n\nIt was rebuilt in 1906 and designed as the classic white structure that has become one of the iconic landmarks on the island. The lighthouse is considered a symbol of Grosse Ile; its image is used on the masthead of the ''Ile Camera'' community newspaper and many other places.  The lighthouse's beacon was turned off in the 1940s, and the structure is no longer an important navigation aid for [[lake freighter]]s. Small boaters still refer to the lighthouse in their navigation of the area.\n\nIn 1965, the Grosse Ile Township purchased the lighthouse from the [[U.S. Department of the Interior]] for $350, with funds provided by the Grosse Ile Historical Society (GIHS). The GIHS was given the responsibility to preserve and maintain the lighthouse.  The GIHS annually holds a tour of the lighthouse during a weekend each fall, which is the only time of the year that it is open to the public.\n\nIsland resident Cameron Waterman invented the [[outboard motor]] and successfully tested his invention during February 1905 in the ice-filled Detroit River off the shore of Grosse Ile. He established the Waterman Marine Motor Company in Detroit.  The company eventually manufactured and sold up to 1,000 outboard motors per year until Waterman sold the business in 1917.  During the fall of 2005, the GIHS celebrated the 100th anniversary of Waterman's invention by hosting a public exhibition featuring fully restored Waterman outboard motors. These are highly collectible and very rare.\n\nDuring the [[Prohibition era]], Grosse Ile became a crossing point for [[rum-running|bootleg]]gers illegally smuggling alcoholic beverages from [[Canada]]. They typically arrived at the island via small speed boats.  During the winter months, some daring [[smuggling|smugglers]] drove cars across the frozen river.\n\n===Aviation and military===\n[[File:NAS Grosse Ile NAN2-47.jpg|thumb|Naval Air Station]]\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, a small airport on the southern end of Grosse Ile was the location of historic early aviation activities.  The [[Curtiss-Wright]] Flying Service operated a flying school at the airport.  The Aircraft Development Corporation built the world's first all-metal [[airship]], the [[ZMC-2]], for the Navy in a large hangar. [[Amelia Earhart]] is rumored to have stopped at the airfield on occasion.\n\nGrosse Ile was the home of a [[U.S. Navy]] base for forty years. The [http://nasgi.org U.S. Naval Air Station Grosse Ile] opened in 1929 after three years of construction of [[seaplane]] and [[dirigible]] facilities.  During [[World War II]], the naval base developed into an important center for military [[flight training]]. The base was expanded considerably to accommodate large numbers of American and British fliers who trained on the island. As a young man during WWII, [[George H. W. Bush]] was stationed at the base for training during 1945 for about two months. He later became a politician and President of the United States.\n\nDuring the height of the [[Cold War]], in 1954 the [[U.S. Army]] installed an [[Project Nike|Ajax-Nike missile]] base at the airfield; it was functional until being decommissioned in 1963. The Navy closed the base during November 1969. The federal government transferred it in 1971 to the township government for civilian use as a municipal airport.\n\nToday, the [[Grosse Ile Municipal Airport]] is used primarily for general aviation. It has also been the site of public airshows. Occasionally it serves as a temporary docking area for [[blimp]]s that visit southeastern Michigan to fly over major sporting events. The United States [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (USEPA) operates the Large Lakes Research Station in one of the buildings on the airport grounds. The airport campus is also the site of [http://www.grosseile.com Grosse Ile Township Hall], which was moved to this location in 2000 from Macomb Street, and a number of private businesses.\n\n===Railroads and bridges===\n\nIn 1873 the Canada Southern Bridge Company, a subsidiary of the [[Canada Southern Railroad Company]], established a railroad from the Michigan mainland to the island that carried both passengers and freight.  The company laid tracks across Grosse Ile and built bridges over the Detroit River to enable trains to be transferred to a ferryboat on Stony Island (one of the islands near the east shoreline of Grosse Ile's \"main island\").  Once on the ferryboat, the train cars were taken to [[Ontario, Canada]] across the river, where they were put back on a rail track to travel to [[Buffalo, New York]] and other points east.  Canada Southern operated trains on this route for about ten years before ceasing service due to financial difficulties.\n\nAfter Canada Southern ended its operations, the [[Michigan Central Railroad]] (MCR) operated a train that provided service between the island and [[Trenton, Michigan]]. From Trenton, travelers could connect with trains or streetcars to Detroit and other cities in the region. In 1904, the Michigan Central Railroad built a small brick and stone depot along the tracks near East River Road on the east side of the island.\n\nTrain service peaked during the early 20th century, but rapidly declined after [[Edward W. Voigt]]'s [[Grosse Ile Bridge Company]] opened the [[Grosse Ile Toll Bridge]] for automobile traffic on November 27, 1913 (Thanksgiving Day).  The bridge, which is privately owned, is on the west side of the island and connects to the city of [[Riverview, Michigan|Riverview]]. After automobile traffic crossing the bridge became the most popular means of traveling to and from the island, the Michigan Central Railroad ceased daily passenger service in early 1924; in 1929 it ended its occasional freight service.\n\nDuring 1931, the county government converted the Michigan Central Railroad's defunct rail bridge crossing the Trenton Channel into the [[Wayne County Bridge]] for use by vehicular, bike and pedestrian traffic.  The rail tracks across the island were replaced by a roadway that is now known as Grosse Ile Parkway.  The Wayne County Bridge is commonly referred to as the \"Free Bridge\" by residents because of it does not charge a toll.\n\nToday, about three-quarters of the vehicle traffic going to and from Grosse Ile travels over the Wayne County Bridge, while one-quarter crosses the Toll Bridge.  The Toll Bridge has been hit twice by [[lake freighter]]s, causing it to close temporarily (in 1965 and in 1992).  The Wayne County Bridge was closed to vehicle traffic for major renovations between May 2, 2007, and December 21, 2007.  During the 2007 county bridge closure period, the Toll Bridge provided the only route for vehicles to travel to and from the island.\n\n===Grosse Ile Historic District===\nToday, the MCR train depot is owned and operated as a community museum by the Gross Ile Historic Society (GIHS). Nearby is the old [[U.S. Customs House (Grosse Ile, Michigan)|U.S. Customs House]], which was relocated to the current site in 1980 from Macomb Street. The GIHS also owns the Custom House, and these are the only structures in the [[National Historic Landmark District|National Historic District]] along East River Road that are regularly open to the public. The district features Saint James [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]], the oldest church building on the island, constructed during 1867 in part with funds provided by a freed slave named [[Lisette Denison Forth|Elizabeth Denison]].  The district includes six homes, built from the 1840s to 1860s, that are outstanding examples of period architecture, particularly [[Gothic Revival]] and [[Jacobethan]] Revival.\n\n===Modern times, growth and preservation===\n\nGrosse Ile has good views of commercial shipping and [[pleasure boat]] traffic on the Detroit River.  Lake freighters and oceangoing ships traveling to destinations around the Great Lakes regularly pass near the east side of the island, where the main channel of the Detroit River separates Grosse Ile from Ontario, Canada.\n\nWhile the shoreline areas of Grosse Ile feature the majority of historically significant places and structures, approximately a dozen 1920s-era homes in the Jewell Colony subdivision, located in the middle of the island, are listed on the Michigan Register of Historic Places. Jewell Colony was the first planned subdivision on the island.\n\nDuring the later 20th century, Grosse Ile had a significant increase in the rate of residential development, given its advantageous location and other amenities. By the 1980 census, the population of Grosse Ile had increased to approximately 9,300\u2014 about 106% over its population in the 1960 census.\n\nFearing the destruction of the natural character and small-town charm of the community, during the early 1990s the Grosse Ile Township established an \"Open Space Program\", to be funded by a voter-approved dedicated local property tax to buy undeveloped land. The township acquired large tracts of environmentally sensitive land to slow the pace of development, preserve the environment, and protect housing values.\n\nIn 1993, a group of residents established a 501(c)(3) [[non-profit organization]] named the Grosse Ile Land & Nature Conservancy, to aid in the protection and stewardship of the diverse natural resources on the island. A number of private owners donated environmentally important woodland and wetland areas to the Conservancy to protect them (and to get a tax write-off.)  \t\n\nThe U.S. EPA granted stewardship responsibilities to the Conservancy for a {{convert|40.5|acre|adj=on}} marsh and upland area on the federally owned section of the Grosse Ile Municipal Airport. This tract of land, which at one time was the location of the Navy's seaplane base and later the Army's Nike missile base, has been restored to its natural state; it features rich biodiversity and rare coastal wetlands. Named the Nature Area by the Conservancy, this land is periodically used by local teachers and [[Scouting in Michigan|Boy Scout groups]] to teach children about nature and the importance of conservation.\t\t\n\nGrosse Ile is a community of about 10,371 residents.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/> ''Money'' magazine ranked Grosse Ile as one of the \"Top 100 Best Places to Live\" in 2009.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/bplive/2009/snapshots/PL2635440.html|title=Best Places to Live 2009 - Top 100: Grosse Ile, MI|date=07-13-09|magazine=Money Magazine|accessdate=2009-07-14}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Grosse Ile, MI township hall.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Grosse Ile Township Hall]]\nThe annual \"Islandfest\" (formerly \"[[Azalea]] Festival\") takes place around Grosse Ile Municipal Airport. On the same site as Islandfest, the Grosse Ile Youth Recreational Association (GIYRA), a 501c3 charity, runs a [[haunted house]] every [[Halloween]]. GIYRA coordinates the youth sporting events for the island children. The sports offered by GIYRA are Football and Cheer, Flag Football, Basketball, Baseball and Softball.\n\nThe island has an indoor tennis facility: six courts inside an old hangar at the city's municipal airport. New ownership has taken over the Tennis Center; they have refinished the courts and are conducting other renovations.<!-- year? -->{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nThe Grosse Ile Soccer Association coordinates the township's soccer league. The rapidly expanding soccer association, which started by hosting a recreational league, has expanded into a larger association. The Grosse Ile Soccer Association has more than 15 select travel / premier level teams on top of the in-house recreational program.\n\nGrosse Ile's community theatre, The Islanders, is Downriver's oldest theatre club and one of the oldest civic theatre groups in the state of Michigan. The club has been active on Grosse Ile since 1925, when friends and neighbors developed a means of entertainment during the long Michigan winters. The first major play was produced on May 21, 1926, by a group of 40 founding members.\n\nThe Grosse Ile High School Robotics Team, 'The Wired Devils', is the island's first robotics team. It is part of the larger community of FIRST teams in Michigan as a whole. The team has grown to more than fifty members since its founding in 2014.\n\nGrosse Ile social clubs include the Grosse Ile Yacht Club, the Ford Yacht Club, the Elba-Mar Boat Club, the Grosse Ile Golf and Country Club, West Shore Golf Course, Water's Edge Golf Course, the Kiwanis Club of Grosse Ile, and the Grosse Ile Rotary Club (founded in 1947).\n\n==Education==\n[[Grosse Ile Township Schools]] serves the township.\n\nOn the island, there are two elementary schools: Parke Lane Elementary which serves grades K-2nd, and Meridian Elementary which serves grades 3rd-5th. The Grosse Ile Middle School enrolls students in 6\u20138, and [[Grosse Ile High School]] provides college preparatory education for grades 9\u201312.  Their mascot is the Red Devil. In 1999 the former middle school was demolished in favor of a new and more up-to-date building. In the process, the historic adjacent school, built in 1911, was demolished amid much controversy. The controversy centered around the desire of many township residents to preserve a historic structure in which many lifelong residents had received their education, and had been the original school building for the island as well.\n\nIn 2001, Grosse Ile was ranked the highest out of 88 school districts in Michigan by ''[[The Detroit News]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.detnews.com/specialreports/2001/reportcard/index.htm|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120728004704/http://www.detnews.com/specialreports/2001/reportcard/index.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 28, 2012|title=Scoring Metro Districts|date=March 4, 2001|newspaper=The Detroit News|accessdate=2009-01-22}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\nThe [[U.S. Census Bureau]] also defined Grosse Ile Township as a [[census-designated place]] (CDP) in the 2000 Census so that the community would appear on the list of places (like cities and villages) as well on the list of county subdivisions (like other townships).  The final statistics for the township and the CDP were identical.\n\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 10,894 people, 4,122 households, and 3,293 families residing in the township.  The [[population density]] was 1,133.9 persons per square mile (437.7/km\u00b2).  There were 4,335 housing units at an average density of 451.2 per square mile (174.2/km\u00b2).  The racial makeup of the township was 95.23% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 0.36% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.34% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 2.74% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.04% [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]], 0.29% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 1.00% from two or more races. [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 1.61% of the population.\n\nThere were 4,122 households out of which 34.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 72.8% were married couples living together, 5.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 20.1% were non-families. 17.8% of all households were made up of individuals and 7.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.  The average household size was 2.64 and the average family size was 2.99.\n\nIn the township the population was spread out with 24.9% under the age of 18, 5.1% from 18 to 24, 23.4% from 25 to 44, 34.8% from 45 to 64, and 11.9% who were 65 years of age or older.  The median age was 43 years. For every 100 females, there were 99.6 males.  For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 97.0 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the township was $87,062, and the median income for a family was $96,226. Males had a median income of $71,777 versus $42,430 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the township was $42,150.  About 1.9% of families and 2.6% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 3.4% of those under age 18 and 2.6% of those age 65 or over.\n\nThe township is considered to be among the safest communities in Michigan.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pub.umich.edu/daily/1997/oct/10-06-97/news/news9.html |title=Grosse Ile ranked safest |date=June 10, 1997 |publisher=The Michigan Daily Online |accessdate=2009-01-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824105841/http://www.pub.umich.edu/daily/1997/oct/10-06-97/news/news9.html |archivedate=August 24, 2007 }}</ref> It is highly affluent and is isolated in the river, with two bridges connecting it to the mainland.\n\n==Notable residents==\n<!-- This is more detail than usual - why is this justified for these notable residents alone?

He awoke from a coma and spent the last five weeks of his life interacting with his family. During the following year, Frazier and his colleague [[William Cohn]] engaged with the public and professionals on their experiences. Their [[TEDMED]] talk introduced them to Daniel Timms, who was driven to find a technological resolution and whose father had died of heart failure.

During the following year, Frazier and his colleague [[William Cohn]] engaged with the public and professionals on their experiences. Their [[TEDMED]] talk introduced them to Daniel Timms, who was driven to find a technological resolution and whose father had died of heart failure.

By 15 he was a civilian typist at [[Camp Merritt, New Jersey]], and enlisted in the Navy (by lying about his age) two years later.\n[[File:GodfreyCBS1938.jpg|thumb|upright|Godfrey spoke directly to his listeners as individuals; he was a foremost pitchman into the TV era]]\n\nGodfrey's father was something of a \"[[Freethought|free thinker]]\" by the standards of the era. He did not disdain organized religion but insisted that his children explore all faiths before deciding for themselves which to embrace. Their childhood friends included Catholic, Jewish and every kind of Protestant playmates. The senior Godfrey was friends with the Vanderbilts, but was as likely to spend his time talking with the shoeshine man or the hotdog vendor about issues of the day. In the book ''Genius in the Family'' (G.P. Putnam's Sons, New York, 1962), written about their mother by Godfrey's youngest sister, Dorothy Gene (who preferred to be called \"Jean\"), with the help of their sister, Kathy, it was reported that the angriest they ever saw their father was when a man on the ferry declared the [[Ku Klux Klan]] a civic organization vital to the good of the community. They rode the ferry back and forth three times, with their father arguing with the man that the Klan was a bunch of \"Blasted, bigoted fools, led 'round by the nose!\"\n\nGodfrey's mother, Kathryn, was a gifted artist and composer whose aspirations to fame were laid aside to take care of her family after her husband, Arthur or \"Darl'\", died. Her creativity enabled the family to get through some very hard times by playing the piano to accompany silent movies, making jams and jellies and crocheting bedspreads to sell, and even cutting off and selling her floor length hair, as it was extremely difficult for a woman of her \"class\" to find work without violating social mores of the time. The one household item that was never sold or turned into firewood was the piano, and she believed at least some of her children would succeed in show business. In her later years some of her compositions were performed by symphony orchestras in Canada, which earned her a mention in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.<ref>{{cite news |title=Names make news. |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,890739,00.html |quote=As a surprise encore to a pop concert in Toronto, Conductor Andre Kostelanetz led the local symphony in the first playing of a spirited number, The Marine Boys March, written by an old acquaintance.

She died of cancer in 1968 at a nursing home in a suburb north of Chicago.\n\nGodfrey served in the [[United States Navy]] from 1920 to 1924 as a radio operator on naval [[destroyer]]s, but returned home to care for the family after his father's death. Additional radio training came during Godfrey's service in the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] from 1927 to 1930. He passed a stringent qualifying examination and was admitted to the prestigious [[Radio Materiel School]] at the [[Naval Research Laboratory]], graduating in 1929. It was during a Coast Guard stint in [[Baltimore]] that on October 5 of that year he appeared on a local talent show and became popular enough to land his own brief weekly program.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/video/opinion/1247468129089/a-colossus-of-the-entertainment-world.html|title=A Colossus of the entertainment world (excerpt of ''The Dick Cavett Show'' from May 8, 1972)|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 25, 2010|accessdate=November 29, 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Radio ==\n[[File:Agodfreytime.jpg|right|thumb|350px|In this CBS publicity photo of ''Arthur Godfrey Time'', vocalist [[Patti Clayton]] is seen at the far right and Godfrey sits in the foreground. Clayton, the original 1944 voice of [[Chiquita Brands International|Chiquita Banana]], was married to Godfrey's director, Saul Ochs.]]\n\nOn leaving the Coast Guard, Godfrey became a radio announcer for the Baltimore station WFBR (now [[WJZ (AM)]]) and moved to Washington, D.C. to become a staff announcer for [[NBC]]-owned station [[WTEM|WRC]] the same year and remained there until 1934.\n\nRecovering from a near-fatal automobile accident en route to a flying lesson in 1931 (he was already an avid flyer), he decided to listen closely to the radio and realized that the stiff, formal style then used by announcers could not connect with the average radio listener. The announcers spoke in stentorian tones, as if giving a formal speech to a crowd and not communicating on a personal level. Godfrey vowed that when he returned to the airwaves, he would affect a relaxed, informal style as if he were talking to just one person. He also used that style to do his own commercials and became a regional star. Over time, he added wisecracks to his commercials and would kid the sponsors, a risky move that offended advertising agency executives whose staff worked on the commercial scripts. Nonetheless, Godfrey's antics quickly gained acceptance when his sponsors discovered their sales actually increased after Godfrey's added jokes. At times, he would read an ad agency script on television as he mockingly rolled his eyes, used a sarcastic tone of voice or added his own wisecracks. Since the sponsors approved, given their added sales, the agencies were powerless to stop him.\n[[File:President Truman attends ceremonies celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Washington Monument. This photo shows... - NARA - 199836.tif|left|thumb|350px|Godfrey at the 1948 ceremony marking the 100th anniversary of the Washington Monument]]\nIn addition to announcing, Godfrey sang and played the [[ukulele]]. In 1934 he became a freelance entertainer, but eventually based himself on a daily show titled ''Sundial'' on [[CBS]]-owned station [[WJSV]] (later [[WTOP-FM|WTOP]] and now [[WFED]]) in Washington. Godfrey was the station's morning disc jockey, playing records, delivering commercials (often with tongue in cheek; a classic example had him referring to [[Bayer Aspirin]] as \"bare ass prin\"), interviewing guests, and even reading news reports during his three-hour shift. Godfrey loved to sing, and would frequently sing random verses during the \"talk\" portions of his program. In 1937, he was a host on ''[[Professor Quiz]]'', radio's first successful quiz program. One surviving broadcast from 1939 has Godfrey unexpectedly turning on his microphone to harmonize with The Foursome's recording of \"[[There'll Be Some Changes Made]].\"\n\nGodfrey was eager to remain connected with the Navy, but found his hip injuries rendered him unsuitable for military service. He knew President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], who listened to his Washington program, and through Roosevelt's intercession, he received a commission in the [[U.S. Naval Reserve]] before [[World War II]]. He would participate in exercises around the Washington area. Godfrey eventually moved his base to the CBS station in New York City, then known as [[WCBS (AM)|WABC]] (now WCBS), and was heard on both [[WJSV]] and WABC for a time. In the autumn of 1942, he also became the announcer for [[Fred Allen]]'s ''[[Texaco Star Theater]]'' show on the CBS network, but a personality conflict between Allen and Godfrey led to his early release from the show after only six weeks.\n\nGodfrey became nationally known in April 1945 when, as CBS's morning-radio man in Washington, he took the microphone for a live, firsthand account of President Roosevelt's funeral procession. The entire CBS network picked up the broadcast, later preserved in the [[Edward R. Murrow]] and [[Fred W. Friendly]] record series, ''I Can Hear it Now.'' Unlike the tight-lipped news reporters and commentators of the day, who delivered news in an earnest, businesslike manner, Godfrey's tone was sympathetic and neighborly, lending immediacy and intimacy to his words. When describing new President [[Harry S. Truman]]'s car in the procession, Godfrey fervently said, in a choked voice, \"God bless him, President Truman.\" Godfrey broke down in tears and cued the listeners back to the studio. The entire nation was moved by his emotional outburst.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/video/opinion/1247468459504/american-success-story.html|title=American Success Story (excerpt of ''The Dick Cavett Show'' from May 8, 1972)|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 26, 2010|accessdate=March 2, 2016}}</ref>\n\nGodfrey made such an impression on the air that CBS gave him his own morning time slot on the nationwide network. ''Arthur Godfrey Time'' was a Monday\u2013Friday show that featured his monologues, interviews with various stars, music from his own in-house combo and regular vocalists. Godfrey's monologues and discussions were usually unscripted, and went wherever he chose. ''Arthur Godfrey Time'' remained a late morning staple on the CBS Radio Network schedule until 1972.<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1964/01/19/118650457.html?pageNumber=359 Adams, Val. \"Anniversary\" (''The New York Times'', January 19, 1964, Section 2, p.X 17).] Retrieved October 27, 2018.</ref>\n\nTwo radio monologues proved to be audience favorites and were rebroadcast on several occasions by popular demand, and later on his television show. They were \"What is a Boy?\" and a follow-up, \"What is a Girl?\"  With the skilled addition of sentimental music, both monologues captured the essence of what made parents love their children, fondly describing the highly varied personality traits of each child as the monologue progressed. Each monologue struck a chord with everyone who heard it. \"What is a boy?\" in particular proved to be so popular that it was released as one of Godfrey's records, which he issued on Columbia Records (Record no. 39487) in the summer of 1951, with \"What is a Girl?\" on the b-side of the record. It peaked on the Billboard charts in August 1951, one of several successful records Godfrey released between 1947 and 1952.\n\nGodfrey was also known for sparking impromptu jam sessions on the air with the band, all of them first-rate musicians who could [[Musical improvisation|create an arrangement as they went]]. He would sometimes begin singing with his ukulele, the band falling in behind him. At other times, he would jump into a number sung by one of the \"Little Godfreys\" and continue it, encouraging solos from various band members. It was further proof of his insistence on spontaneity on the air. He began to play a [[baritone ukulele]]. Over time, tutored by the band's guitarist [[Remo Palmier]], Godfrey's playing took a decidedly jazzy quality. Palmier, a top Manhattan studio guitarist, was also a respected jazz guitarist and the only one of Godfrey's musicians to remain with the show from its 1945 debut until the final 1972 broadcast.\n\nIn 1947, Godfrey had a surprise hit record with the novelty \"Too Fat Polka (She's Too Fat For Me)\" written by Ross MacLean and Arthur Richardson. The song reached number two in the US charts and its popularity led to the [[Andrews Sisters]] recording a version adapted to the women's point-of-view. In general, Godfrey despised most of his novelty recordings, including \"Too Fat Polka\", his biggest selling record.\n[[File:Bing Crosby Perry Como Arthur Godfrey 1950.JPG|thumb|left|Publicity still with [[Bing Crosby]] and [[Perry Como]] in 1950 for Crosby's radio show]]\nGodfrey's morning show was supplemented by a primetime variety show, ''[[Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts]],'' broadcasting from the [[CBS Studio Building]] at 49 East 52nd Street where he had his main office. This variety show, a showcase for rising young performers, was a slight variation of CBS's successful ''[[Original Amateur Hour]]''. Some of the performers had made public appearances in their home towns and were recommended to Godfrey by friends or colleagues. These \"sponsors\" would accompany the performers to the broadcast and introduce them to Godfrey on the air. Two acts from the same 1948 broadcast were [[Wally Cox]] and [[The Chordettes]]. Both were big hits that night, and both were signed to recording contracts. Godfrey took special interest in The Chordettes, who sang his kind of barbershop-quartet harmony, and he soon made them part of his broadcasting and recording \"family.\"  Godfrey was also known for extemporizing music on the show, grabbing his ukulele and launching into songs the band may not have rehearsed. He had insisted on employing musicians in his small orchestra who would be able to accompany him quickly and \"follow\" him as he sang. This resulted in impromptu jam sessions on some broadcasts, rarely heard on mainstream variety programs.\n\nPerformers who appeared on ''Talent Scouts'' included [[Lenny Bruce]], [[Don Adams]], [[Tony Bennett]], [[Patsy Cline]], [[Pat Boone]], opera singer [[Marilyn Horne]], [[Roy Clark]], and Irish vocalist [[Carmel Quinn]]. Later, he promoted \"Little Godfrey\" Janette Davis to a management position as the show's talent coordinator. Three notable acts rejected for the show were [[Elvis Presley]], [[The Orioles|Sonny Till & The Orioles]], and [[The Four Freshmen]]. Following his appearances on the ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'', Presley traveled to New York for an unsuccessful ''Talent Scouts'' audition in April 1955; after the ''Talent Scouts'' staff rejected The Orioles, they went on to have a hit record with their version of \"[[Crying in the Chapel]]\" (a major hit song by [[Darrell Glenn]], written by Glenn's father, Artie, and a subsequent hit for Presley, as well) and kicked off the \"bird group\" trend of early rock 'n' roll.\n\nGodfrey was also an avid [[amateur radio operator]], with the station [[call sign]] K4LIB. He was a member of the [[National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame]] in the radio division.<ref>{{cite web| title=Past award recipients| url =https://www.nab.org/events/awards/pastawardwinners.asp?id=1926| publisher=National Association of Broadcasters | accessdate = 2020-03-17}} </ref>\n\n== Television ==\n[[File:Agodfrey.jpg|right|thumb|300px|1953 portrait of Godfrey with ukulele]]\nIn 1948, ''Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts'' began to be simultaneously broadcast on radio and television, and by 1952, ''Arthur Godfrey Time'' also appeared on both media. The radio version ran an hour and a half; the TV version an hour, later expanded to an hour and a half. The Friday shows were heard on radio only, because at the end of the week, Godfrey traditionally broadcast his portion from a studio at his Virginia farm outside of Washington, D.C., and TV cameras were unable to transmit live pictures of him and his New York cast at the same time. Godfrey's skills as a commercial pitchman brought him a large number of loyal sponsors, including Lipton Tea, [[Frigidaire]], [[Pillsbury Company|Pillsbury]] cake mixes and [[Liggett & Myers]]'s [[Chesterfield (cigarette)|Chesterfield cigarettes]]. By 1959, total advertising billings from Godfrey's TV shows were estimated at an industry-high $150 million, almost double those of second-place [[Ed Sullivan]].<ref>{{cite news |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=July 8, 1959|title=TV's Alltime Top 10 Grossers|page=1|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/variety215-1959-07#page/n64/mode/1up|access-date=May 20, 2019|via=[[Archive.org]]}}</ref>\n\nHe found that one way to enhance his pitches was to extemporize his commercials, poking fun at the sponsors (while never showing disrespect for the products themselves), the sponsors' company executives, and advertising agency types who wrote the scripted commercials that he regularly ignored. (If he read them at all, he ridiculed them or even threw aside the scripts in front of the cameras.) To the surprise of the advertising agencies and sponsors, Godfrey's kidding of the commercials and products frequently enhanced the sales of those products. His popularity and ability to sell brought a windfall to [[CBS]], accounting for a significant percentage of their corporate profits. While his willingness to mock the scripted commercials provided to him by sponsors' ad agencies angered those agencies, the sponsors, concerned only with improving their sales, were happy to let Godfrey tear apart those scripts (even physically on occasion).{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nIn 1949, ''Arthur Godfrey and His Friends'', a weekly informal variety show, began on CBS-TV in prime time. His affable personality combined warmth, heart, and occasional bits of ''[[double entendre]]'' repartee, such as his remark when the show went on location: \"Well, here we are in Miami Bitch. Hehheh.\" Godfrey received adulation from fans who felt that despite his considerable wealth, he was really \"one of them,\" his personality that of a friendly next-door-neighbor. His ability to sell products, insisting he would not promote any in which he did not personally believe, gave him a level of trust from his audience, a belief that \"if Godfrey said it, it must be so.\" When he quit smoking after his 1953 hip surgery, he began speaking out against smoking on the air, to the displeasure of longtime sponsor Chesterfield. When he stood his ground, the company withdrew as a sponsor in early 1954. Godfrey shrugged off their departure since he knew other sponsors would easily fill the vacancy.\n\nEventually Godfrey added a weekend \"best of\" program culled from the week's ''Arthur Godfrey Time'', known as ''Arthur Godfrey Digest''. He began to veer away from interviewing stars in favor of a small group of regular performers that became known as the \"Little Godfreys.\" Many of these artists were relatively obscure, but were given colossal national exposure, some of them former ''Talent Scouts'' winners including Hawaiian vocalist [[Haleloke Kahauolopua|Haleloke]], veteran Irish tenor [[Frank Parker (singer)|Frank Parker]], Marian Marlowe and [[Julius LaRosa]], who was in the Navy when Godfrey, doing his annual Naval reserve duty, discovered the young singer. He subsequently invited him on the show as a guest, offering him a job upon his discharge. LaRosa joined the cast in 1951 and became a favorite with Godfrey's immense audience, who also saw him on the prime-time weekly show ''Arthur Godfrey and his Friends''. Godfrey also had a regular announcer-foil on the show, Tony Marvin. Godfrey preferred his performers not to use personal managers or agents, but often had his staff represent the artists if they were doing personal appearances, which allowed him considerable control over their careers and incomes. In 1953, after LaRosa hired an agent, Godfrey was so angry that he fired him on the air.<ref>[https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7370527/singer-julius-la-rosa-fired-on-arthur-godfrey-show-dies-at-86 \"Singer Julius La Rosa, Fired on Godfrey show, Dies at 86\"], Billboard, May 15, 2016</ref>\n\nGodfrey was one of the busiest men in the entertainment industry, often presiding over several daytime and evening radio and TV shows simultaneously. (Even busier was [[Robert Q. Lewis]], who hosted ''Arthur Godfrey Time'' whenever Godfrey was absent, adding to his own crowded schedule.) Both Godfrey and Lewis made commercial recordings for Columbia Records, often featuring the \"Little Godfreys\" in various combinations. In addition to the \"Too Fat Polka\" mentioned above, these included \"Candy and Cake\"; \"Dance Me Loose\". \"[[I'm Looking Over a Four Leaf Clover]]\"; \"Slap 'Er Down Again, Paw\"; \"[[Slow Poke]]\"; and \"[[The Thing (song)|The Thing]]\". In 1951 Godfrey also narrated a nostalgic movie documentary, ''Fifty Years Before Your Eyes'', produced for [[Warner Brothers]] by silent-film anthologist [[Robert Youngson]].\n\nGodfrey had been in pain since the 1931 car crash that damaged his hip. In 1953, he underwent pioneering [[hip replacement surgery]] in Boston using an early plastic [[artificial hip]] joint. The operation was successful and he returned to the show to the delight of his vast audience. During his recovery, CBS was so concerned about losing Godfrey's audience that they encouraged him to broadcast live from his Beacon Hill estate (near [[Leesburg, Virginia]]), with the signal carried by microwave towers built on the property.\n\nGodfrey's immense popularity and the trust placed in him by audiences was noticed by not just advertisers but also his friend U.S. President [[Dwight Eisenhower]], who asked him to record a number of public service announcements to be played on American television in the case of [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]]. It was thought that viewers would be reassured by Godfrey's grandfatherly tone and folksy manner. The existence of the PSA tapes was confirmed in 2004 by former CBS president [[Frank Stanton (executive)|Dr. Frank Stanton]] in an exchange with a writer with the Web site CONELRAD.\n\n== Aviation ==\n[[File:Arthur Godfrey - George Cooper - Smith de France.jpg - A-23317.jpg|300px|left|thumb|Godfrey (left) with [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics|NACA]] pilot George Cooper and [[NASA Ames Research Center|Ames]] director Smith DeFrance]]\n\nGodfrey learned to fly in 1929 while working in broadcast radio in the Washington, D.C., area, starting with gliders, then learning to fly airplanes. He was badly injured on his way to a flying lesson one afternoon in 1931 when an oncoming truck lost its left front wheel and hit him head on. Godfrey spent months recuperating, and the injury kept him from flying on active duty during World War II. He served as a reserve officer in the [[United States Navy]] in a public affairs role during the war.\n\nGodfrey used his pervasive fame to advocate a strong [[Anti-communism|anti-Communist]] stance and to pitch for enhanced strategic [[Airpower|air power]] in the [[Cold War]] atmosphere. In addition to his advocacy for civil rights, he became a strong promoter of his middle-class fans vacationing in Hawaii and [[Miami Beach, Florida]], formerly enclaves for the wealthy. He made a television movie in 1953, taking the controls of an [[Eastern Air Lines]] [[Lockheed Constellation]] airliner and flying to Miami, thus showing how safe airline travel had become. As a reserve officer, he used his public position to cajole the Navy into qualifying him as a Naval Aviator, and played that against the [[United States Air Force]], who later successfully recruited him into the Air Force Reserve. At one time during the 1950s, Godfrey had flown every active aircraft in the military inventory.\n\nHis continued unpaid promotion of Eastern Air Lines earned him the undying gratitude of good friend [[Eddie Rickenbacker]], the World War I flying ace who was the president of the airline. He was such a good friend of the airline that Rickenbacker took a retiring [[Douglas DC-3]], fitted it out with an executive interior and [[Douglas DC-4|DC-4]] engines, and presented it to Godfrey, who then used it to commute to the studios in New York City from his huge [[Leesburg, Virginia]], farm every Sunday night.\n\n===Incidents===\nThe Godfrey show began appearing on television, and some Southern CBS affiliates objected to the barbershop quartet The Mariners. This group of four [[US Coast Guard]] veterans included two whites and two blacks. Godfrey resisted criticism from network affiliates in Southern states and struck back. He noted that black and white troops were serving together in the [[Korean War]], and he attacked critics including Democratic Georgia Governor [[Herman Talmadge]]. Godfrey's opposition to racial discrimination was longstanding, alluded to on his broadcasts.\n\nIn January 1954, Godfrey buzzed the control tower of [[Teterboro Airport]] in his DC-3. His certificate was suspended for six months. He claimed that the windy conditions that day required him to turn immediately after takeoff, but in fact he was peeved with the tower because they would not give him the runway that he requested.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} He later recorded a satirical song about the incident called \"Teterboro Tower,\" roughly to the tune of \"[[Wabash Cannonball]]\". A similar event occurred while he flew near Chicago in 1956, though no sanctions were imposed. These incidents underscored the differences between his private life and public persona in the wake of the controversies that swirled around him after firing Julius LaRosa.\n\n===Leesburg airport===\nThe original Leesburg airport, which Godfrey owned and referred to affectionately on his show as \"The Old Cow Pasture,\" was less than a mile from the center of town, and local residents had come to expect rattling windows and crashing dishes every Sunday evening and Friday afternoon.\n\nIn 1960, Godfrey proposed building a new airport by selling the old field and donating a portion of the sale to a local group. Since Godfrey funded the majority of the airport, it is now known as [[Leesburg Executive Airport]] at Godfrey Field. He was also known for flying a [[North American/Ryan Navion]], a smaller single-engined airplane, a [[Lockheed Jetstar]], and in later years a [[Beech Baron]] and a [[Beech Duke]], registration number N1M.  In 1964, he became one of the founding members of the board of directors of [[NetJets|Executive Jet Aviation Corporation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netjets.com/about_netjets/timeline.asp |title=NetJets History |publisher=NetJets Division of Berkshire Hathaway |accessdate=13 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416022716/http://www.netjets.com/about_netjets/timeline.asp |archivedate=April 16, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n== Behind the scenes ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}\nBehind Godfrey's on-air warmth was a volatile and controlling personality. He insisted that his \"Little Godfreys\" attend dance and singing classes, believing all should be versatile performers regardless of whether they possessed the aptitude for those disciplines. In meetings with the cast and his staff, he could be abusive and intimidating. CBS historian Robert Metz, in ''CBS: Reflections in a Bloodshot Eye'', quoted Godfrey as having once told cast and staffers, \"Remember that many of you are here over the bodies I have personally slain. I have done it before and I can do it again.\"  He also demanded, though there was no contractual requirement, that his cast members refrain from hiring personal managers or booking agents. He insisted his staff could handle all that. Given the rise of the \"Little Godfreys\" from total obscurity due to their exposure on Godfrey's programs, no one was inclined to challenge him. Despite his ability to bring in profits, CBS executives who respected Godfrey professionally disliked him personally, since he often baited them on and off the air, occasionally by name. This included CBS chairman [[William S. Paley]].\n\nGodfrey's attitude was controlling before his hip surgery, but upon his return, he added more air time to his morning shows and became critical of a number of aspects of the broadcasts. One night, he substituted a shortened, hastily arranged version of his Wednesday night variety show in place of the scheduled \"Talent Scouts\" presentation, feeling that none of the talent was up to standard. He also began casting a critical eye on others in the cast, particularly LaRosa, whose popularity continued to grow.\n\n===LaRosa incident===\n{{more citations needed section|date=July 2018}}\nLike many men of his generation, Julius LaRosa as well as other male Godfrey cast members thought dance lessons to be somewhat effeminate and chafed when Godfrey ordered them for his entire performing crew. Metz suggested that Godfrey instituted the practice because his own physical limitations made him sensitive to the need for coordination on camera. \"Godfrey,\" Metz wrote, \"was concerned about his cast in his paternalistic way.\"\n\nGodfrey and LaRosa had a dispute in the fall of 1953 when LaRosa, the most popular of the \"Little Godfreys,\" missed a dance lesson due to a family emergency. He claimed he had advised Godfrey, but was nonetheless barred from the show for a day in retaliation, via a notice placed on a cast bulletin board. LaRosa attempted to discuss the incident with Godfrey at the hotel where the host resided during the week, but Godfrey walked by him and refused to discuss anything with him. At that point, LaRosa retained topnotch manager Tommy Rockwell to renegotiate his contract with Godfrey or, failing that, to receive an outright release. However, such talks had yet to occur.\n[[File:Julius La Rosa 1955.JPG|left|thumb|200px|Julius LaRosa]]\n\nLaRosa was also signed to [[Cadence Records]], founded by Godfrey's musical director [[Archie Bleyer]], who produced \"[[Eh, Cumpari!]]\", the best-selling hit of LaRosa's musical career. LaRosa admitted the record's success had made him a little cocky. Godfrey discovered that LaRosa hired Rockwell in the wake of the dance lesson reprimand when he received a letter from Rockwell dictating that all dealings with LaRosa would go through General Artists Corporation, Rockwell's agency. At that point Godfrey immediately consulted with CBS President Dr. [[Frank Stanton (executive)|Frank Stanton]], who noted that Godfrey had hired LaRosa on-air (after his initial appearance on ''Talent Scouts'') and suggested firing him the same way. Whether Stanton intended this to occur after Godfrey spoke with LaRosa and his managers about the singer's future on the show, or whether Stanton suggested Godfrey actually fire LaRosa on air with no warning, is unknown. Soon after the firings, Stanton conceded \"maybe this was a mistake.\"\n\nOn October 19, 1953, near the end of his morning radio show&nbsp;\u2014 deliberately waiting until ''after'' the television portion had ended&nbsp;\u2014 after lavishing praise on LaRosa in introducing the singer's performance of \"[[Manhattan (song)|Manhattan]],\" Godfrey thanked him and then announced that this was LaRosa's \"[[swan song]]\" with the show, adding, \"He goes now, out on his own&nbsp;\u2014 as his own star&nbsp;\u2014 soon to be seen on his own programs, and I know you'll wish him godspeed as much as I do\". Godfrey then signed off for the day saying, \"This is the CBS Radio Network\". LaRosa, who had to be told what the phrase \"swan song\" meant, was dumbfounded, since he had not been informed beforehand of his departure and contract renegotiations had yet to happen. In perhaps a further illumination of the ego that Godfrey had formerly kept hidden, radio historian [[Gerald Nachman (journalist)|Gerald Nachman]], in ''Raised on Radio'', claims that what really miffed Godfrey about his now-former protege was that LaRosa's fan mail had come to outnumber Godfrey's.<ref name=PoTPBS>[https://www.pbs.org/pioneersoftelevision/ PBS Documentary ''Pioneers of Television: Variety'' originally broadcast January 9, 2008]</ref> It is likely that a combination of these factors led to Godfrey's decision to discharge LaRosa. It is not likely Godfrey expected the public outcry that ensued, a result of the incident running directly counter to Godfrey's avuncular image.\n\nThe LaRosa incident opened an era of controversy that swirled around Godfrey and gradually destroyed his folksy image. It was not, however, the only firing that day. In 1952, Archie Bleyer had formed his own label, [[Cadence Records]], which recorded LaRosa. The bandleader also married Janet Ertel of [[The Chordettes]]. The focus of Godfrey's anger was the fact that Bleyer, while vacationing from the show, had produced a spoken-word record by Godfrey's Chicago counterpart [[Don McNeill (performer)|Don McNeill]] to be released on Cadence. McNeill hosted ''[[Don McNeill's Breakfast Club|The Breakfast Club]]'', which had been Godfrey's direct competition on the [[NBC]] [[Blue Network]] (later [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]) since Godfrey's days at WJSV. Despite the McNeill show's far more modest following, Godfrey was unduly offended, even paranoid, at what he felt was disloyalty on Bleyer's part. A face-to-face meeting between Bleyer and Godfrey following LaRosa's dismissal, described by Godfrey, revealed Bleyer was unconcerned about the matter. He simply shrugged off the dismissal and focused on developing Cadence, which found significant success in later years thanks to hits by the [[Everly Brothers]] and [[Andy Williams]]. He never commented publicly on the rift with Godfrey.\n\nLaRosa, on the other hand, was beloved enough by Godfrey's fans that they saved their harshest criticism for Godfrey himself. After the firing, a conference was held by LaRosa and his agent. On October 21, with the public outcry rising, Godfrey further complicated the matter at a press conference of his own where he announced the dismissal of LaRosa and Bleyer, citing their \"outside activities.\" While praising LaRosa, Godfrey added he felt that LaRosa had lost his \"humility\". The charge, given Godfrey's sudden baring of his own ego beneath the facade of warmth, brought mockery and a significant backlash from the public and press.<ref name=PoTPBS/> Almost instantly, Godfrey and the phrase \"no humility\" became the butt of many comedians' jokes. He later claimed he had given LaRosa a release from his contract that the singer requested. Godfrey, however, provided no evidence to support that contention.\n\n===The firings continue===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}\nThe Teterboro incident in January 1954 kept Godfrey's image negative in the media. At that same time, he ended his relationship with Chesterfield. After his 1953 hospitalization broke his smoking habit, he had concluded that smoking was not beneficial and very likely harmful, a total reverse from his earlier commercials. His once-friendly rapport with the company began to fade as he spoke out against smoking on the air.\n\nGodfrey subsequently fired other producers and cast members including [[Marion Marlowe]], Haleloke and [[The Mariners (vocal group)|The Mariners]]. The integrated quartet believed Godfrey had caved in to the continued criticism from CBS's southern affiliate stations over their continued presence on the show.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} [[Pat Boone]] and [[Carmel Quinn]] joined the cast for a time. But any thoughts of curtailing the fired cast members' network-television exposure backfired somewhat when they continued to perform for his substitute host, [[Robert Q. Lewis]], who by now had his own midday show on CBS.\n\nOccasionally, Godfrey snapped at cast members on the air including  Tony Marvin. Other performers, most notably [[Pat Boone]] and, briefly, [[Patsy Cline]], stepped in as \"Little Godfreys.\" Cline, who had won top place for her appearance on \"Talent Scouts,\" decided against becoming a regular, confining her appearances to a few guest spots. Eventually, Godfrey did away with any regular cast except Marvin, bringing in performers for a stipulated period of time and, if they did well with his audiences, bringing them back at various times.\n\nGodfrey's problems with the media and public feuds with newspaper columnists such as [[Jack O'Brian]] and newspaperman turned CBS variety show host [[Ed Sullivan]] were duly documented by the media, which began running critical expos\u00e9 articles linking him to several female \"Little Godfreys.\" Godfrey's anger at Sullivan stemmed from the variety show impresario's featuring of fired \"Little Godfreys\" on his Sunday night show, including LaRosa. Godfrey later dismissed longtime vocalist [[Frank Parker (singer)|Frank Parker]], an Italian-American known for his Irish tenor. Parker had joked about Godfrey during a Las Vegas appearance.\n\n===In popular culture===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}\nAs the media turned on Godfrey, two films, ''[[The Great Man]]'' (1956) starring [[Jos\u00e9 Ferrer]], who also directed and produced, and Elia Kazan's ''[[A Face in the Crowd (film)|A Face in the Crowd]]'' (1957) starring [[Andy Griffith]] and [[Patricia Neal]], were inspired in part by Godfrey's increasingly controversial career:\n*''The Great Man'', adapted from a novel by TV writer Al Morgan, centered on a tribute broadcast for Herb Fuller, a Godfrey-like figure killed in a car crash whose genial public demeanor concealed a dissolute phony. Various parallels to Godfrey's life could be seen in the film, from his affair with the show's girl singer to his dicey relationship with the show's bandleader. The term \"The Fuller Family\" was a direct play off \"The Little Godfreys.\"\n*''A Face in the Crowd'' creator [[Budd Schulberg]] maintained his story was actually inspired by contrasts between the public image and private personality of [[Will Rogers|Will Rogers, Sr.]] Also, the film's protagonist, Lonesome Rhodes, with his combination of country singing and country storytelling, superficially resembled popular singer and network TV host [[Tennessee Ernie Ford]]. Nonetheless, prominent elements of the film, including the scenes when Rhodes (played by Andy Griffith) spoofed a mattress commercial on a TV show he was hosting in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], were clearly Godfrey-inspired. The research by Kazan and Schulberg included attending an advertising agency meeting about Lipton Tea.\n\nGodfrey was a frequent target for parody:\n*As early as 1949, comedians [[Bob and Ray]] presented an obvious parody with the character of Arthur Sturdley (voiced by [[Bob Elliott (comedian)|Bob Elliott]]) who, in plummy, folksy tones, constantly ragged his announcer Tony ([[Ray Goulding]], imitating Godfrey's announcer Tony Marvin). Tony, meanwhile, would incessantly answer every question with \"That's right, Arthur!\". In the 1969 film ''[[Cold Turkey (film)|Cold Turkey]]'', Ray (not Bob) played another parody of Godfrey, this time as folksy radio announcer \"Arthur Lordly\". Comedian [[Jerry Lester]] mocked him as \"Arthur Clodfrey.\" The [[Joy Boys]] performed a similar satire of Godfrey on their radio show, calling their fellow Washingtonian \"Arthur Codfish\".\n*Satirist [[Stan Freberg]] picked up on Bob and Ray's use of the catchphrase \"That's right, Arthur\", and recorded a barbed spoof of Godfrey's show. \"That's Right, Arthur\" depicted the star as a rambling, self-absorbed motormouth and his longtime announcer (Tony Marvin, portrayed by voice actor [[Daws Butler]]) as a yes-man, responding \"That's right, Arthur\" to every vapid Godfrey pronouncement. Fearing legal problems and noting objections from Godfrey's attorney, Freberg's label, Capitol Records, would not release it, to Freberg's frustration. The recording finally appeared on a 1990s Freberg career retrospective CD box set.\n*Following the Julius LaRosa episode, singer-songwriter [[Ruth Wallis]], renowned for her ''[[double-entendre]]'' songs, recorded \"Dear Mr. Godfrey,\" a country tune that implored him to \"hire me and fire me and make a star of me.\"\n\nGodfrey appeared on many major magazine covers including ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', and over a dozen ''[[TV Guide]]'' covers. He was also the first man to ever make the cover of ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' magazine. Despite his ''faux pas'', Godfrey still commanded a strong presence and a loyal fan base. ''Talent Scouts'' lasted until 1958.\n\n===Allegations of anti-Semitism===\n{{more citations needed section|date=July 2018}}\nAccusations of anti-Semitism shadowed Godfrey during the height of his career and continue to persist. [[Eddie Fisher (singer)|Eddie Fisher]], in his autobiography, ''Been There, Done That'', discusses the rumor:\n\n{{quote|One of the best-known anti-Semites in show business was Arthur Godfrey, the host of radio's most important amateur talent contest. Godfrey owned the Kenilworth Hotel in Florida, which supposedly had a sign in front that read NO DOGS OR JEWS ALLOWED. But when I got the opportunity to appear on Talent Scouts, I leaped at it. I didn't care that Godfrey wouldn't let me in his hotel as long as he let me sing on his radio show.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}}}\n\nArthur J. Singer, author of ''Arthur Godfrey: The Adventures of an American Broadcaster'' (2000), rejects this accusation, citing Godfrey's good personal relations with a number of Jews in the entertainment industry, including his longtime announcer Tony Marvin. As for Godfrey's association with the Kenilworth, the hotel did establish a \"No Jews\" policy in the 1920s, but abandoned it when Godfrey acquired a stake in the hotel in the early 1950s. In the eyes of the public, the increasingly negative publicity Godfrey, despite his ongoing popularity, had generated since 1953, much of it self-inflicted, no doubt added credence to the accusations. In fact Godfrey was only a part-owner of the hotel and insisted that when he took that stake, he ended any discriminatory policies that existed. Further undermining Fisher's account, he appeared on ''Talent Scouts'' years before Godfrey purchased a part interest in the Kenilworth.\n\n[[Dick Cavett]], in an opinion piece for the ''New York Times'' (July 16, 2010), calls the accusations of anti-Semitism \"...purest nonsense\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/16/more-of-our-man-godfrey |title=More of Our Man Godfrey |publisher=The New York Times opinion |first=Dick |last=Cavett |authorlink=Dick Cavett |date=July 16, 2010 |accessdate=November 8, 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Later life ==\nGodfrey was an avid hunter who teamed with professional hunters to [[Big-game hunting|kill big-game animals]] on safari in Africa, employing helicopters to gain close access to his prey.<ref name=life1>{{cite news |title=Helicopter Safari in Africa |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nz8EAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false |work=[[Life (magazine)|Life]] |date=June 10, 1957 |accessdate=2016-01-06 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1959, Godfrey began suffering chest pains. Examination by physicians revealed a mass in his chest that could have been lung cancer. Surgeons discovered cancer in one lung that spread to his [[aorta]]. One lung was removed. Yet, despite the disease's discouragingly high mortality rate, it became clear after radiation treatments that Godfrey had beaten the substantial odds against him. He returned to the air on a prime-time  TV special but resumed the daily morning show on radio only, reverting to a format featuring guest stars such as ragtime pianist [[Max Morath]] and Irish vocalist Carmel Quinn, maintaining a live combo of first-rate Manhattan musicians (under the direction of Sy Mann) as he had done since the beginning. Godfrey also became a persuasive spokesman advocating regular medical checkups to detect cancer early, noting his cancer was cured only because it was discovered when still treatable.\n\nGodfrey's initial return to television occurred in a TV special centered on his gratitude to have survived what was by 1959 standards, an almost-certain death sentence. He sang, danced, did commercials and announced that he'd make greater use of the new [[videotape]] technology for the future. Despite appearing healthy on the broadcast, Godfrey, fearing the aftereffects of his illness would adversely affect his appearance, announced that he would resume the Monday\u2013Friday ''Arthur Godfrey Time'' on radio only, ending the daily TV broadcasts.\n\nLongtime announcer [[Tony Marvin]], with Godfrey since the late 1940s, did not make the transition to the new program. Marvin was one of Godfrey's few associates who left on amicable terms, and went on to a career as a radio  news anchor on the [[Mutual Broadcasting System]]. The Godfrey show was the last daily longform entertainment program on American network radio when Godfrey and CBS agreed to end it in April 1972, when his 20-year contract with the network expired. Godfrey by then was a colonel in the United States [[Air Force Reserve Command|Air Force Reserve]] and still an active pilot.\n\nHe appeared in the movies ''[[4 for Texas]]'' (1963), ''[[The Glass Bottom Boat]]'' (1966), and ''[[Where Angels Go, Trouble Follows]]'' (1968). He briefly co-hosted ''[[Candid Camera]]'' with creator [[Allen Funt]], but that relationship, like so many others, ended abruptly and acrimoniously; Godfrey hosted at least one broadcast ''without'' Funt. Godfrey also made various guest appearances, and he and [[Lucille Ball]] co-hosted the [[CBS]] special ''50 Years of Television'' (1978). He also made a [[cameo appearance]] in the 1979 [[B-movie]] ''[[Angels Revenge]]''.\n\n===Post-retirement===\nIn retirement, Godfrey wanted to find ways back onto a regular TV schedule. He appeared on the rock band [[Moby Grape]]'s song \"Just Like [[Gene Autry]]: A Foxtrot\", a 1920s-pop-style piece from their album [[Wow/Grape Jam|''Wow'']]. Godfrey's political outlook was complex, and to some, contradictory; his lifelong admiration for Franklin Roosevelt combined with a powerful [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] streak in his views and his open support for [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] as president. During his later years he became a powerful voice for the environmentalist movement who identified with the youth culture that irreverently opposed the \"establishment,\" as he felt he had done during his peak years. He renounced a lucrative endorsement deal with [[Colgate-Palmolive]] when it became clear to him that it clashed with his environmental principles. He had made commercials for [[Colgate (toothpaste)|Colgate]] toothpaste and the detergent Axion, only to repudiate the latter product when he found out that Axion [[Phosphates in detergent|contained phosphates]], implicated in water pollution. He did far fewer commercials after that incident.\n\nWhile Godfrey was a great fan of technology, including aviation and aerospace developments, he also found time for pursuits of an earlier era. He was a dedicated horseman and master at [[dressage]] and made charity appearances at horse shows.\n\nHe also found in later years that his enthusiasm for high-tech had its limits when he concluded that some technological developments posed the potential to threaten the environment. During one appearance on ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'', Godfrey commented that the United States needed the [[supersonic transport]] \"about as much as we need another bag of those clunkers from the moon.\"  The concern that the SST contributed to noise pollution, an issue Godfrey was instrumental in raising in the United States, is considered to have effectively ended [[Supersonic transport|SST]] interest in the U.S., leaving it to Britain and France. ([[Dick Cavett|Cavett]] claims that Godfrey's statement also earned tax audits from the [[Richard Nixon]]-era [[Internal Revenue Service]] for the show's entire production staff.)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/25/a-godfrey-a-man-for-a-long-long-season/ |title=A. Godfrey: A Man for a Long, Long Season |first=Dick |last=Cavett |publisher=New York Times Blogs |date=June 25, 2010 |accessdate=May 9, 2013}}</ref>\n\nDespite an intense desire to remain in the public eye, Godfrey's presence ebbed considerably over the next ten years, despite an [[HBO]] special and an appearance on a [[PBS]] salute to the 1950s. A 1981 attempt to reconcile him with LaRosa for a Godfrey show reunion record album, bringing together Godfrey and a number of the \"Little Godfreys,\" collapsed. Godfrey had initially resisted the idea, floated by his agent, but finally relented. At an initially amicable meeting, Godfrey reasserted that LaRosa wanted out of his contract and asked why he had not explained that instead of insisting he was fired without warning. When LaRosa began reminding him of the dance lesson controversy, Godfrey, then in his late seventies, exploded and the meeting ended in shambles.\n\n===The Arthur Godfrey Collection===\nToward the end of his life, Godfrey became a major supporter of [[public broadcasting]], and left his large personal archive of papers and programs to public station [[WNET|WNET/Thirteen]] in New York. Godfrey biographer Art Singer helped to arrange a permanent home for the Godfrey material at the [[Broadcasting Archives at the University of Maryland]] in early 1998. The collection contains hundreds of [[kinescope]]s of Godfrey television programs, more than 4,000 [[magnetic tape sound recording|audiotapes]] and [[wire recording]]s of his various radio shows, [[videotape]]s, and [[transcription disc]]s. The collection also contains Godfrey's voluminous personal papers and business records, which cover his spectacular rise and precipitous fall in the industry over a period of more than 50 years.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://digital.lib.umd.edu/archivesum/actions.DisplayEADDoc.do?source=/MdU.ead.lab.0035.xml&style=ead| title=Thirteen/WNET Arthur Godfrey Collection| publisher=the Special Collections Department of the University of Maryland Libraries| access-date=January 1, 2013| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622221245/http://digital.lib.umd.edu/archivesum/actions.DisplayEADDoc.do?source=%2FMdU.ead.lab.0035.xml&style=ead| archive-date=June 22, 2012| url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Death===\n[[Emphysema]], thought to have been caused by decades of smoking and the radiation treatments for Godfrey's lung cancer, became a problem in the early 1980s.

At the peak of his success in the mid-1950s, Godfrey headed two [[CBS-TV]] weekly series and a daily 90-minute television mid-morning show, but his presence had been reduced by the early 1960s to hosting the occasional television special and his daily network radio show, which ended in 1972.\n\nGodfrey was strongly identified with many of his commercial sponsors, especially [[Chesterfield cigarettes]] and [[Lipton Tea]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://graphic-design.tjs-labs.com/gallery-view?keyword=ARTHUR%20GODFREY |title=Gallery of classic graphic design featuring Arthur Godfrey acting as spokesman for various products including Lipton |access-date=January 31, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210075450/http://graphic-design.tjs-labs.com/gallery-view?keyword=ARTHUR%20GODFREY |archive-date=February 10, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He advertised Chesterfield for many years, during which he devised the slogan \"Buy 'em by the carton\", but he terminated his relationship with the company after he quit smoking, five years before he was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1959.<ref>http://www.britannica.com/biography/Arthur-Godfrey</ref> He later became a prominent spokesman for the [[Tobacco control movement]].\n\n== Early life ==\n\nGodfrey was born in Manhattan in 1903.<ref name=time1/> His mother, Kathryn Morton Godfrey, was from a well-to-do [[Oswego, New York]], family which disapproved of her marriage to an older Englishman, Arthur's father, Arthur Hanbury Godfrey. The senior Godfrey was a sportswriter and considered an expert on [[Surrey (carriage)|surrey]] and [[Hackney horse|hackney]] horses, but the advent of the automobile devastated the family's finances. By 1915, when Arthur was 12, the family had moved to [[Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey]].<ref>Emblen, Frank.

By 15 he was a civilian typist at [[Camp Merritt, New Jersey]], and enlisted in the Navy (by lying about his age) two years later.\n[[File:GodfreyCBS1938.jpg|thumb|upright|Godfrey spoke directly to his listeners as individuals; he was a foremost pitchman into the TV era]]\n\nGodfrey's father was something of a \"[[Freethought|free thinker]]\" by the standards of the era. He did not disdain organized religion but insisted that his children explore all faiths before deciding for themselves which to embrace. Their childhood friends included Catholic, Jewish and every kind of Protestant playmates. The senior Godfrey was friends with the Vanderbilts, but was as likely to spend his time talking with the shoeshine man or the hotdog vendor about issues of the day. In the book ''Genius in the Family'' (G.P. Putnam's Sons, New York, 1962), written about their mother by Godfrey's youngest sister, Dorothy Gene (who preferred to be called \"Jean\"), with the help of their sister, Kathy, it was reported that the angriest they ever saw their father was when a man on the ferry declared the [[Ku Klux Klan]] a civic organization vital to the good of the community. They rode the ferry back and forth three times, with their father arguing with the man that the Klan was a bunch of \"Blasted, bigoted fools, led 'round by the nose!\"\n\nGodfrey's mother, Kathryn, was a gifted artist and composer whose aspirations to fame were laid aside to take care of her family after her husband, Arthur or \"Darl'\", died. Her creativity enabled the family to get through some very hard times by playing the piano to accompany silent movies, making jams and jellies and crocheting bedspreads to sell, and even cutting off and selling her floor length hair, as it was extremely difficult for a woman of her \"class\" to find work without violating social mores of the time. The one household item that was never sold or turned into firewood was the piano, and she believed at least some of her children would succeed in show business. In her later years some of her compositions were performed by symphony orchestras in Canada, which earned her a mention in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.<ref>{{cite news |title=Names make news. |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,890739,00.html |quote=As a surprise encore to a pop concert in Toronto, Conductor Andre Kostelanetz led the local symphony in the first playing of a spirited number, The Marine Boys March, written by an old acquaintance.

Clayton, the original 1944 voice of [[Chiquita Brands International|Chiquita Banana]], was married to Godfrey's director, Saul Ochs.]]\n\nOn leaving the Coast Guard, Godfrey became a radio announcer for the Baltimore station WFBR (now [[WJZ (AM)]]) and moved to Washington, D.C. to become a staff announcer for [[NBC]]-owned station [[WTEM|WRC]] the same year and remained there until 1934.\n\nRecovering from a near-fatal automobile accident en route to a flying lesson in 1931 (he was already an avid flyer), he decided to listen closely to the radio and realized that the stiff, formal style then used by announcers could not connect with the average radio listener. The announcers spoke in stentorian tones, as if giving a formal speech to a crowd and not communicating on a personal level. Godfrey vowed that when he returned to the airwaves, he would affect a relaxed, informal style as if he were talking to just one person. He also used that style to do his own commercials and became a regional star. Over time, he added wisecracks to his commercials and would kid the sponsors, a risky move that offended advertising agency executives whose staff worked on the commercial scripts. Nonetheless, Godfrey's antics quickly gained acceptance when his sponsors discovered their sales actually increased after Godfrey's added jokes. At times, he would read an ad agency script on television as he mockingly rolled his eyes, used a sarcastic tone of voice or added his own wisecracks. Since the sponsors approved, given their added sales, the agencies were powerless to stop him.\n[[File:President Truman attends ceremonies celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Washington Monument. This photo shows... - NARA - 199836.tif|left|thumb|350px|Godfrey at the 1948 ceremony marking the 100th anniversary of the Washington Monument]]\nIn addition to announcing, Godfrey sang and played the [[ukulele]]. In 1934 he became a freelance entertainer, but eventually based himself on a daily show titled ''Sundial'' on [[CBS]]-owned station [[WJSV]] (later [[WTOP-FM|WTOP]] and now [[WFED]]) in Washington. Godfrey was the station's morning disc jockey, playing records, delivering commercials (often with tongue in cheek; a classic example had him referring to [[Bayer Aspirin]] as \"bare ass prin\"), interviewing guests, and even reading news reports during his three-hour shift. Godfrey loved to sing, and would frequently sing random verses during the \"talk\" portions of his program. In 1937, he was a host on ''[[Professor Quiz]]'', radio's first successful quiz program. One surviving broadcast from 1939 has Godfrey unexpectedly turning on his microphone to harmonize with The Foursome's recording of \"[[There'll Be Some Changes Made]].\"\n\nGodfrey was eager to remain connected with the Navy, but found his hip injuries rendered him unsuitable for military service. He knew President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], who listened to his Washington program, and through Roosevelt's intercession, he received a commission in the [[U.S. Naval Reserve]] before [[World War II]]. He would participate in exercises around the Washington area. Godfrey eventually moved his base to the CBS station in New York City, then known as [[WCBS (AM)|WABC]] (now WCBS), and was heard on both [[WJSV]] and WABC for a time. In the autumn of 1942, he also became the announcer for [[Fred Allen]]'s ''[[Texaco Star Theater]]'' show on the CBS network, but a personality conflict between Allen and Godfrey led to his early release from the show after only six weeks.\n\nGodfrey became nationally known in April 1945 when, as CBS's morning-radio man in Washington, he took the microphone for a live, firsthand account of President Roosevelt's funeral procession. The entire CBS network picked up the broadcast, later preserved in the [[Edward R. Murrow]] and [[Fred W. Friendly]] record series, ''I Can Hear it Now.'' Unlike the tight-lipped news reporters and commentators of the day, who delivered news in an earnest, businesslike manner, Godfrey's tone was sympathetic and neighborly, lending immediacy and intimacy to his words. When describing new President [[Harry S. Truman]]'s car in the procession, Godfrey fervently said, in a choked voice, \"God bless him, President Truman.\" Godfrey broke down in tears and cued the listeners back to the studio. The entire nation was moved by his emotional outburst.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/video/opinion/1247468459504/american-success-story.html|title=American Success Story (excerpt of ''The Dick Cavett Show'' from May 8, 1972)|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 26, 2010|accessdate=March 2, 2016}}</ref>\n\nGodfrey made such an impression on the air that CBS gave him his own morning time slot on the nationwide network. ''Arthur Godfrey Time'' was a Monday\u2013Friday show that featured his monologues, interviews with various stars, music from his own in-house combo and regular vocalists. Godfrey's monologues and discussions were usually unscripted, and went wherever he chose. ''Arthur Godfrey Time'' remained a late morning staple on the CBS Radio Network schedule until 1972.<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1964/01/19/118650457.html?pageNumber=359 Adams, Val. \"Anniversary\" (''The New York Times'', January 19, 1964, Section 2, p.X 17).] Retrieved October 27, 2018.</ref>\n\nTwo radio monologues proved to be audience favorites and were rebroadcast on several occasions by popular demand, and later on his television show. They were \"What is a Boy?\" and a follow-up, \"What is a Girl?\"  With the skilled addition of sentimental music, both monologues captured the essence of what made parents love their children, fondly describing the highly varied personality traits of each child as the monologue progressed. Each monologue struck a chord with everyone who heard it. \"What is a boy?\" in particular proved to be so popular that it was released as one of Godfrey's records, which he issued on Columbia Records (Record no. 39487) in the summer of 1951, with \"What is a Girl?\" on the b-side of the record. It peaked on the Billboard charts in August 1951, one of several successful records Godfrey released between 1947 and 1952.\n\nGodfrey was also known for sparking impromptu jam sessions on the air with the band, all of them first-rate musicians who could [[Musical improvisation|create an arrangement as they went]]. He would sometimes begin singing with his ukulele, the band falling in behind him. At other times, he would jump into a number sung by one of the \"Little Godfreys\" and continue it, encouraging solos from various band members. It was further proof of his insistence on spontaneity on the air. He began to play a [[baritone ukulele]]. Over time, tutored by the band's guitarist [[Remo Palmier]], Godfrey's playing took a decidedly jazzy quality. Palmier, a top Manhattan studio guitarist, was also a respected jazz guitarist and the only one of Godfrey's musicians to remain with the show from its 1945 debut until the final 1972 broadcast.\n\nIn 1947, Godfrey had a surprise hit record with the novelty \"Too Fat Polka (She's Too Fat For Me)\" written by Ross MacLean and Arthur Richardson. The song reached number two in the US charts and its popularity led to the [[Andrews Sisters]] recording a version adapted to the women's point-of-view. In general, Godfrey despised most of his novelty recordings, including \"Too Fat Polka\", his biggest selling record.\n[[File:Bing Crosby Perry Como Arthur Godfrey 1950.JPG|thumb|left|Publicity still with [[Bing Crosby]] and [[Perry Como]] in 1950 for Crosby's radio show]]\nGodfrey's morning show was supplemented by a primetime variety show, ''[[Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts]],'' broadcasting from the [[CBS Studio Building]] at 49 East 52nd Street where he had his main office. This variety show, a showcase for rising young performers, was a slight variation of CBS's successful ''[[Original Amateur Hour]]''. Some of the performers had made public appearances in their home towns and were recommended to Godfrey by friends or colleagues. These \"sponsors\" would accompany the performers to the broadcast and introduce them to Godfrey on the air. Two acts from the same 1948 broadcast were [[Wally Cox]] and [[The Chordettes]]. Both were big hits that night, and both were signed to recording contracts. Godfrey took special interest in The Chordettes, who sang his kind of barbershop-quartet harmony, and he soon made them part of his broadcasting and recording \"family.\"  Godfrey was also known for extemporizing music on the show, grabbing his ukulele and launching into songs the band may not have rehearsed. He had insisted on employing musicians in his small orchestra who would be able to accompany him quickly and \"follow\" him as he sang. This resulted in impromptu jam sessions on some broadcasts, rarely heard on mainstream variety programs.\n\nPerformers who appeared on ''Talent Scouts'' included [[Lenny Bruce]], [[Don Adams]], [[Tony Bennett]], [[Patsy Cline]], [[Pat Boone]], opera singer [[Marilyn Horne]], [[Roy Clark]], and Irish vocalist [[Carmel Quinn]]. Later, he promoted \"Little Godfrey\" Janette Davis to a management position as the show's talent coordinator. Three notable acts rejected for the show were [[Elvis Presley]], [[The Orioles|Sonny Till & The Orioles]], and [[The Four Freshmen]]. Following his appearances on the ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'', Presley traveled to New York for an unsuccessful ''Talent Scouts'' audition in April 1955; after the ''Talent Scouts'' staff rejected The Orioles, they went on to have a hit record with their version of \"[[Crying in the Chapel]]\" (a major hit song by [[Darrell Glenn]], written by Glenn's father, Artie, and a subsequent hit for Presley, as well) and kicked off the \"bird group\" trend of early rock 'n' roll.\n\nGodfrey was also an avid [[amateur radio operator]], with the station [[call sign]] K4LIB. He was a member of the [[National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame]] in the radio division.<ref>{{cite web| title=Past award recipients| url =https://www.nab.org/events/awards/pastawardwinners.asp?id=1926| publisher=National Association of Broadcasters | accessdate = 2020-03-17}} </ref>\n\n== Television ==\n[[File:Agodfrey.jpg|right|thumb|300px|1953 portrait of Godfrey with ukulele]]\nIn 1948, ''Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts'' began to be simultaneously broadcast on radio and television, and by 1952, ''Arthur Godfrey Time'' also appeared on both media. The radio version ran an hour and a half; the TV version an hour, later expanded to an hour and a half. The Friday shows were heard on radio only, because at the end of the week, Godfrey traditionally broadcast his portion from a studio at his Virginia farm outside of Washington, D.C., and TV cameras were unable to transmit live pictures of him and his New York cast at the same time. Godfrey's skills as a commercial pitchman brought him a large number of loyal sponsors, including Lipton Tea, [[Frigidaire]], [[Pillsbury Company|Pillsbury]] cake mixes and [[Liggett & Myers]]'s [[Chesterfield (cigarette)|Chesterfield cigarettes]]. By 1959, total advertising billings from Godfrey's TV shows were estimated at an industry-high $150 million, almost double those of second-place [[Ed Sullivan]].<ref>{{cite news |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=July 8, 1959|title=TV's Alltime Top 10 Grossers|page=1|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/variety215-1959-07#page/n64/mode/1up|access-date=May 20, 2019|via=[[Archive.org]]}}</ref>\n\nHe found that one way to enhance his pitches was to extemporize his commercials, poking fun at the sponsors (while never showing disrespect for the products themselves), the sponsors' company executives, and advertising agency types who wrote the scripted commercials that he regularly ignored. (If he read them at all, he ridiculed them or even threw aside the scripts in front of the cameras.) To the surprise of the advertising agencies and sponsors, Godfrey's kidding of the commercials and products frequently enhanced the sales of those products. His popularity and ability to sell brought a windfall to [[CBS]], accounting for a significant percentage of their corporate profits. While his willingness to mock the scripted commercials provided to him by sponsors' ad agencies angered those agencies, the sponsors, concerned only with improving their sales, were happy to let Godfrey tear apart those scripts (even physically on occasion).{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nIn 1949, ''Arthur Godfrey and His Friends'', a weekly informal variety show, began on CBS-TV in prime time. His affable personality combined warmth, heart, and occasional bits of ''[[double entendre]]'' repartee, such as his remark when the show went on location: \"Well, here we are in Miami Bitch. Hehheh.\" Godfrey received adulation from fans who felt that despite his considerable wealth, he was really \"one of them,\" his personality that of a friendly next-door-neighbor. His ability to sell products, insisting he would not promote any in which he did not personally believe, gave him a level of trust from his audience, a belief that \"if Godfrey said it, it must be so.\" When he quit smoking after his 1953 hip surgery, he began speaking out against smoking on the air, to the displeasure of longtime sponsor Chesterfield. When he stood his ground, the company withdrew as a sponsor in early 1954. Godfrey shrugged off their departure since he knew other sponsors would easily fill the vacancy.\n\nEventually Godfrey added a weekend \"best of\" program culled from the week's ''Arthur Godfrey Time'', known as ''Arthur Godfrey Digest''. He began to veer away from interviewing stars in favor of a small group of regular performers that became known as the \"Little Godfreys.\" Many of these artists were relatively obscure, but were given colossal national exposure, some of them former ''Talent Scouts'' winners including Hawaiian vocalist [[Haleloke Kahauolopua|Haleloke]], veteran Irish tenor [[Frank Parker (singer)|Frank Parker]], Marian Marlowe and [[Julius LaRosa]], who was in the Navy when Godfrey, doing his annual Naval reserve duty, discovered the young singer. He subsequently invited him on the show as a guest, offering him a job upon his discharge. LaRosa joined the cast in 1951 and became a favorite with Godfrey's immense audience, who also saw him on the prime-time weekly show ''Arthur Godfrey and his Friends''. Godfrey also had a regular announcer-foil on the show, Tony Marvin. Godfrey preferred his performers not to use personal managers or agents, but often had his staff represent the artists if they were doing personal appearances, which allowed him considerable control over their careers and incomes. In 1953, after LaRosa hired an agent, Godfrey was so angry that he fired him on the air.<ref>[https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7370527/singer-julius-la-rosa-fired-on-arthur-godfrey-show-dies-at-86 \"Singer Julius La Rosa, Fired on Godfrey show, Dies at 86\"], Billboard, May 15, 2016</ref>\n\nGodfrey was one of the busiest men in the entertainment industry, often presiding over several daytime and evening radio and TV shows simultaneously. (Even busier was [[Robert Q. Lewis]], who hosted ''Arthur Godfrey Time'' whenever Godfrey was absent, adding to his own crowded schedule.) Both Godfrey and Lewis made commercial recordings for Columbia Records, often featuring the \"Little Godfreys\" in various combinations. In addition to the \"Too Fat Polka\" mentioned above, these included \"Candy and Cake\"; \"Dance Me Loose\". \"[[I'm Looking Over a Four Leaf Clover]]\"; \"Slap 'Er Down Again, Paw\"; \"[[Slow Poke]]\"; and \"[[The Thing (song)|The Thing]]\". In 1951 Godfrey also narrated a nostalgic movie documentary, ''Fifty Years Before Your Eyes'', produced for [[Warner Brothers]] by silent-film anthologist [[Robert Youngson]].\n\nGodfrey had been in pain since the 1931 car crash that damaged his hip. In 1953, he underwent pioneering [[hip replacement surgery]] in Boston using an early plastic [[artificial hip]] joint. The operation was successful and he returned to the show to the delight of his vast audience. During his recovery, CBS was so concerned about losing Godfrey's audience that they encouraged him to broadcast live from his Beacon Hill estate (near [[Leesburg, Virginia]]), with the signal carried by microwave towers built on the property.\n\nGodfrey's immense popularity and the trust placed in him by audiences was noticed by not just advertisers but also his friend U.S. President [[Dwight Eisenhower]], who asked him to record a number of public service announcements to be played on American television in the case of [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]]. It was thought that viewers would be reassured by Godfrey's grandfatherly tone and folksy manner. The existence of the PSA tapes was confirmed in 2004 by former CBS president [[Frank Stanton (executive)|Dr. Frank Stanton]] in an exchange with a writer with the Web site CONELRAD.\n\n== Aviation ==\n[[File:Arthur Godfrey - George Cooper - Smith de France.jpg - A-23317.jpg|300px|left|thumb|Godfrey (left) with [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics|NACA]] pilot George Cooper and [[NASA Ames Research Center|Ames]] director Smith DeFrance]]\n\nGodfrey learned to fly in 1929 while working in broadcast radio in the Washington, D.C., area, starting with gliders, then learning to fly airplanes. He was badly injured on his way to a flying lesson one afternoon in 1931 when an oncoming truck lost its left front wheel and hit him head on. Godfrey spent months recuperating, and the injury kept him from flying on active duty during World War II. He served as a reserve officer in the [[United States Navy]] in a public affairs role during the war.\n\nGodfrey used his pervasive fame to advocate a strong [[Anti-communism|anti-Communist]] stance and to pitch for enhanced strategic [[Airpower|air power]] in the [[Cold War]] atmosphere. In addition to his advocacy for civil rights, he became a strong promoter of his middle-class fans vacationing in Hawaii and [[Miami Beach, Florida]], formerly enclaves for the wealthy. He made a television movie in 1953, taking the controls of an [[Eastern Air Lines]] [[Lockheed Constellation]] airliner and flying to Miami, thus showing how safe airline travel had become. As a reserve officer, he used his public position to cajole the Navy into qualifying him as a Naval Aviator, and played that against the [[United States Air Force]], who later successfully recruited him into the Air Force Reserve. At one time during the 1950s, Godfrey had flown every active aircraft in the military inventory.\n\nHis continued unpaid promotion of Eastern Air Lines earned him the undying gratitude of good friend [[Eddie Rickenbacker]], the World War I flying ace who was the president of the airline. He was such a good friend of the airline that Rickenbacker took a retiring [[Douglas DC-3]], re-named her \"Matilda,\" fitted her out with an executive interior and [[Douglas DC-4|DC-4]] engines, and presented it to Godfrey, who then used it to commute to the studios in New York City from his huge [[Leesburg, Virginia]], farm every Sunday night. After tearing out the interior, the plane was subsequently used in a marijuana smuggling operation out of Tampa for Colombian pot.\n\n===Incidents===\nThe Godfrey show began appearing on television, and some Southern CBS affiliates objected to the barbershop quartet The Mariners. This group of four [[US Coast Guard]] veterans included two whites and two blacks. Godfrey resisted criticism from network affiliates in Southern states and struck back. He noted that black and white troops were serving together in the [[Korean War]], and he attacked critics including Democratic Georgia Governor [[Herman Talmadge]]. Godfrey's opposition to racial discrimination was longstanding, alluded to on his broadcasts.\n\nIn January 1954, Godfrey buzzed the control tower of [[Teterboro Airport]] in his DC-3. His certificate was suspended for six months. He claimed that the windy conditions that day required him to turn immediately after takeoff, but in fact he was peeved with the tower because they would not give him the runway that he requested.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} He later recorded a satirical song about the incident called \"Teterboro Tower,\" roughly to the tune of \"[[Wabash Cannonball]]\". A similar event occurred while he flew near Chicago in 1956, though no sanctions were imposed. These incidents underscored the differences between his private life and public persona in the wake of the controversies that swirled around him after firing Julius LaRosa.\n\n===Leesburg airport===\nThe original Leesburg airport, which Godfrey owned and referred to affectionately on his show as \"The Old Cow Pasture,\" was less than a mile from the center of town, and local residents had come to expect rattling windows and crashing dishes every Sunday evening and Friday afternoon.\n\nIn 1960, Godfrey proposed building a new airport by selling the old field and donating a portion of the sale to a local group. Since Godfrey funded the majority of the airport, it is now known as [[Leesburg Executive Airport]] at Godfrey Field. He was also known for flying a [[North American/Ryan Navion]], a smaller single-engined airplane, a [[Lockheed Jetstar]], and in later years a [[Beech Baron]] and a [[Beech Duke]], registration number N1M.  In 1964, he became one of the founding members of the board of directors of [[NetJets|Executive Jet Aviation Corporation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netjets.com/about_netjets/timeline.asp |title=NetJets History |publisher=NetJets Division of Berkshire Hathaway |accessdate=13 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416022716/http://www.netjets.com/about_netjets/timeline.asp |archivedate=April 16, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n== Behind the scenes ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}\nBehind Godfrey's on-air warmth was a volatile and controlling personality. He insisted that his \"Little Godfreys\" attend dance and singing classes, believing all should be versatile performers regardless of whether they possessed the aptitude for those disciplines. In meetings with the cast and his staff, he could be abusive and intimidating. CBS historian Robert Metz, in ''CBS: Reflections in a Bloodshot Eye'', quoted Godfrey as having once told cast and staffers, \"Remember that many of you are here over the bodies I have personally slain. I have done it before and I can do it again.\"  He also demanded, though there was no contractual requirement, that his cast members refrain from hiring personal managers or booking agents. He insisted his staff could handle all that. Given the rise of the \"Little Godfreys\" from total obscurity due to their exposure on Godfrey's programs, no one was inclined to challenge him. Despite his ability to bring in profits, CBS executives who respected Godfrey professionally disliked him personally, since he often baited them on and off the air, occasionally by name. This included CBS chairman [[William S. Paley]].\n\nGodfrey's attitude was controlling before his hip surgery, but upon his return, he added more air time to his morning shows and became critical of a number of aspects of the broadcasts. One night, he substituted a shortened, hastily arranged version of his Wednesday night variety show in place of the scheduled \"Talent Scouts\" presentation, feeling that none of the talent was up to standard. He also began casting a critical eye on others in the cast, particularly LaRosa, whose popularity continued to grow.\n\n===LaRosa incident===\n{{more citations needed section|date=July 2018}}\nLike many men of his generation, Julius LaRosa as well as other male Godfrey cast members thought dance lessons to be somewhat effeminate and chafed when Godfrey ordered them for his entire performing crew. Metz suggested that Godfrey instituted the practice because his own physical limitations made him sensitive to the need for coordination on camera. \"Godfrey,\" Metz wrote, \"was concerned about his cast in his paternalistic way.\"\n\nGodfrey and LaRosa had a dispute in the fall of 1953 when LaRosa, the most popular of the \"Little Godfreys,\" missed a dance lesson due to a family emergency. He claimed he had advised Godfrey, but was nonetheless barred from the show for a day in retaliation, via a notice placed on a cast bulletin board. LaRosa attempted to discuss the incident with Godfrey at the hotel where the host resided during the week, but Godfrey walked by him and refused to discuss anything with him. At that point, LaRosa retained topnotch manager Tommy Rockwell to renegotiate his contract with Godfrey or, failing that, to receive an outright release. However, such talks had yet to occur.\n[[File:Julius La Rosa 1955.JPG|left|thumb|200px|Julius LaRosa]]\n\nLaRosa was also signed to [[Cadence Records]], founded by Godfrey's musical director [[Archie Bleyer]], who produced \"[[Eh, Cumpari!]]\", the best-selling hit of LaRosa's musical career. LaRosa admitted the record's success had made him a little cocky. Godfrey discovered that LaRosa hired Rockwell in the wake of the dance lesson reprimand when he received a letter from Rockwell dictating that all dealings with LaRosa would go through General Artists Corporation, Rockwell's agency. At that point Godfrey immediately consulted with CBS President Dr. [[Frank Stanton (executive)|Frank Stanton]], who noted that Godfrey had hired LaRosa on-air (after his initial appearance on ''Talent Scouts'') and suggested firing him the same way. Whether Stanton intended this to occur after Godfrey spoke with LaRosa and his managers about the singer's future on the show, or whether Stanton suggested Godfrey actually fire LaRosa on air with no warning, is unknown. Soon after the firings, Stanton conceded \"maybe this was a mistake.\"\n\nOn October 19, 1953, near the end of his morning radio show&nbsp;\u2014 deliberately waiting until ''after'' the television portion had ended&nbsp;\u2014 after lavishing praise on LaRosa in introducing the singer's performance of \"[[Manhattan (song)|Manhattan]],\" Godfrey thanked him and then announced that this was LaRosa's \"[[swan song]]\" with the show, adding, \"He goes now, out on his own&nbsp;\u2014 as his own star&nbsp;\u2014 soon to be seen on his own programs, and I know you'll wish him godspeed as much as I do\". Godfrey then signed off for the day saying, \"This is the CBS Radio Network\". LaRosa, who had to be told what the phrase \"swan song\" meant, was dumbfounded, since he had not been informed beforehand of his departure and contract renegotiations had yet to happen. In perhaps a further illumination of the ego that Godfrey had formerly kept hidden, radio historian [[Gerald Nachman (journalist)|Gerald Nachman]], in ''Raised on Radio'', claims that what really miffed Godfrey about his now-former protege was that LaRosa's fan mail had come to outnumber Godfrey's.<ref name=PoTPBS>[https://www.pbs.org/pioneersoftelevision/ PBS Documentary ''Pioneers of Television: Variety'' originally broadcast January 9, 2008]</ref> It is likely that a combination of these factors led to Godfrey's decision to discharge LaRosa. It is not likely Godfrey expected the public outcry that ensued, a result of the incident running directly counter to Godfrey's avuncular image.\n\nThe LaRosa incident opened an era of controversy that swirled around Godfrey and gradually destroyed his folksy image. It was not, however, the only firing that day. In 1952, Archie Bleyer had formed his own label, [[Cadence Records]], which recorded LaRosa. The bandleader also married Janet Ertel of [[The Chordettes]]. The focus of Godfrey's anger was the fact that Bleyer, while vacationing from the show, had produced a spoken-word record by Godfrey's Chicago counterpart [[Don McNeill (performer)|Don McNeill]] to be released on Cadence. McNeill hosted ''[[Don McNeill's Breakfast Club|The Breakfast Club]]'', which had been Godfrey's direct competition on the [[NBC]] [[Blue Network]] (later [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]) since Godfrey's days at WJSV. Despite the McNeill show's far more modest following, Godfrey was unduly offended, even paranoid, at what he felt was disloyalty on Bleyer's part. A face-to-face meeting between Bleyer and Godfrey following LaRosa's dismissal, described by Godfrey, revealed Bleyer was unconcerned about the matter. He simply shrugged off the dismissal and focused on developing Cadence, which found significant success in later years thanks to hits by the [[Everly Brothers]] and [[Andy Williams]]. He never commented publicly on the rift with Godfrey.\n\nLaRosa, on the other hand, was beloved enough by Godfrey's fans that they saved their harshest criticism for Godfrey himself. After the firing, a conference was held by LaRosa and his agent. On October 21, with the public outcry rising, Godfrey further complicated the matter at a press conference of his own where he announced the dismissal of LaRosa and Bleyer, citing their \"outside activities.\" While praising LaRosa, Godfrey added he felt that LaRosa had lost his \"humility\". The charge, given Godfrey's sudden baring of his own ego beneath the facade of warmth, brought mockery and a significant backlash from the public and press.<ref name=PoTPBS/> Almost instantly, Godfrey and the phrase \"no humility\" became the butt of many comedians' jokes. He later claimed he had given LaRosa a release from his contract that the singer requested. Godfrey, however, provided no evidence to support that contention.\n\n===The firings continue===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}\nThe Teterboro incident in January 1954 kept Godfrey's image negative in the media. At that same time, he ended his relationship with Chesterfield. After his 1953 hospitalization broke his smoking habit, he had concluded that smoking was not beneficial and very likely harmful, a total reverse from his earlier commercials. His once-friendly rapport with the company began to fade as he spoke out against smoking on the air.\n\nGodfrey subsequently fired other producers and cast members including [[Marion Marlowe]], Haleloke and [[The Mariners (vocal group)|The Mariners]]. The integrated quartet believed Godfrey had caved in to the continued criticism from CBS's southern affiliate stations over their continued presence on the show.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} [[Pat Boone]] and [[Carmel Quinn]] joined the cast for a time. But any thoughts of curtailing the fired cast members' network-television exposure backfired somewhat when they continued to perform for his substitute host, [[Robert Q. Lewis]], who by now had his own midday show on CBS.\n\nOccasionally, Godfrey snapped at cast members on the air including  Tony Marvin. Other performers, most notably [[Pat Boone]] and, briefly, [[Patsy Cline]], stepped in as \"Little Godfreys.\" Cline, who had won top place for her appearance on \"Talent Scouts,\" decided against becoming a regular, confining her appearances to a few guest spots. Eventually, Godfrey did away with any regular cast except Marvin, bringing in performers for a stipulated period of time and, if they did well with his audiences, bringing them back at various times.\n\nGodfrey's problems with the media and public feuds with newspaper columnists such as [[Jack O'Brian]] and newspaperman turned CBS variety show host [[Ed Sullivan]] were duly documented by the media, which began running critical expos\u00e9 articles linking him to several female \"Little Godfreys.\" Godfrey's anger at Sullivan stemmed from the variety show impresario's featuring of fired \"Little Godfreys\" on his Sunday night show, including LaRosa. Godfrey later dismissed longtime vocalist [[Frank Parker (singer)|Frank Parker]], an Italian-American known for his Irish tenor. Parker had joked about Godfrey during a Las Vegas appearance.\n\n===In popular culture===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}\nAs the media turned on Godfrey, two films, ''[[The Great Man]]'' (1956) starring [[Jos\u00e9 Ferrer]], who also directed and produced, and Elia Kazan's ''[[A Face in the Crowd (film)|A Face in the Crowd]]'' (1957) starring [[Andy Griffith]] and [[Patricia Neal]], were inspired in part by Godfrey's increasingly controversial career:\n*''The Great Man'', adapted from a novel by TV writer Al Morgan, centered on a tribute broadcast for Herb Fuller, a Godfrey-like figure killed in a car crash whose genial public demeanor concealed a dissolute phony. Various parallels to Godfrey's life could be seen in the film, from his affair with the show's girl singer to his dicey relationship with the show's bandleader. The term \"The Fuller Family\" was a direct play off \"The Little Godfreys.\"\n*''A Face in the Crowd'' creator [[Budd Schulberg]] maintained his story was actually inspired by contrasts between the public image and private personality of [[Will Rogers|Will Rogers, Sr.]] Also, the film's protagonist, Lonesome Rhodes, with his combination of country singing and country storytelling, superficially resembled popular singer and network TV host [[Tennessee Ernie Ford]]. Nonetheless, prominent elements of the film, including the scenes when Rhodes (played by Andy Griffith) spoofed a mattress commercial on a TV show he was hosting in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], were clearly Godfrey-inspired. The research by Kazan and Schulberg included attending an advertising agency meeting about Lipton Tea.\n\nGodfrey was a frequent target for parody:\n*As early as 1949, comedians [[Bob and Ray]] presented an obvious parody with the character of Arthur Sturdley (voiced by [[Bob Elliott (comedian)|Bob Elliott]]) who, in plummy, folksy tones, constantly ragged his announcer Tony ([[Ray Goulding]], imitating Godfrey's announcer Tony Marvin). Tony, meanwhile, would incessantly answer every question with \"That's right, Arthur!\". In the 1969 film ''[[Cold Turkey (film)|Cold Turkey]]'', Ray (not Bob) played another parody of Godfrey, this time as folksy radio announcer \"Arthur Lordly\". Comedian [[Jerry Lester]] mocked him as \"Arthur Clodfrey.\" The [[Joy Boys]] performed a similar satire of Godfrey on their radio show, calling their fellow Washingtonian \"Arthur Codfish\".\n*Satirist [[Stan Freberg]] picked up on Bob and Ray's use of the catchphrase \"That's right, Arthur\", and recorded a barbed spoof of Godfrey's show. \"That's Right, Arthur\" depicted the star as a rambling, self-absorbed motormouth and his longtime announcer (Tony Marvin, portrayed by voice actor [[Daws Butler]]) as a yes-man, responding \"That's right, Arthur\" to every vapid Godfrey pronouncement. Fearing legal problems and noting objections from Godfrey's attorney, Freberg's label, Capitol Records, would not release it, to Freberg's frustration. The recording finally appeared on a 1990s Freberg career retrospective CD box set.\n*Following the Julius LaRosa episode, singer-songwriter [[Ruth Wallis]], renowned for her ''[[double-entendre]]'' songs, recorded \"Dear Mr. Godfrey,\" a country tune that implored him to \"hire me and fire me and make a star of me.\"\n\nGodfrey appeared on many major magazine covers including ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', and over a dozen ''[[TV Guide]]'' covers. He was also the first man to ever make the cover of ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' magazine. Despite his ''faux pas'', Godfrey still commanded a strong presence and a loyal fan base. ''Talent Scouts'' lasted until 1958.\n\n===Allegations of anti-Semitism===\n{{more citations needed section|date=July 2018}}\nAccusations of anti-Semitism shadowed Godfrey during the height of his career and continue to persist. [[Eddie Fisher (singer)|Eddie Fisher]], in his autobiography, ''Been There, Done That'', discusses the rumor:\n\n{{quote|One of the best-known anti-Semites in show business was Arthur Godfrey, the host of radio's most important amateur talent contest. Godfrey owned the Kenilworth Hotel in Florida, which supposedly had a sign in front that read NO DOGS OR JEWS ALLOWED. But when I got the opportunity to appear on Talent Scouts, I leaped at it. I didn't care that Godfrey wouldn't let me in his hotel as long as he let me sing on his radio show.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}}}\n\nArthur J. Singer, author of ''Arthur Godfrey: The Adventures of an American Broadcaster'' (2000), rejects this accusation, citing Godfrey's good personal relations with a number of Jews in the entertainment industry, including his longtime announcer Tony Marvin. As for Godfrey's association with the Kenilworth, the hotel did establish a \"No Jews\" policy in the 1920s, but abandoned it when Godfrey acquired a stake in the hotel in the early 1950s. In the eyes of the public, the increasingly negative publicity Godfrey, despite his ongoing popularity, had generated since 1953, much of it self-inflicted, no doubt added credence to the accusations. In fact Godfrey was only a part-owner of the hotel and insisted that when he took that stake, he ended any discriminatory policies that existed. Further undermining Fisher's account, he appeared on ''Talent Scouts'' years before Godfrey purchased a part interest in the Kenilworth.\n\n[[Dick Cavett]], in an opinion piece for the ''New York Times'' (July 16, 2010), calls the accusations of anti-Semitism \"...purest nonsense\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/16/more-of-our-man-godfrey |title=More of Our Man Godfrey |publisher=The New York Times opinion |first=Dick |last=Cavett |authorlink=Dick Cavett |date=July 16, 2010 |accessdate=November 8, 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Later life ==\nGodfrey was an avid hunter who teamed with professional hunters to [[Big-game hunting|kill big-game animals]] on safari in Africa, employing helicopters to gain close access to his prey.<ref name=life1>{{cite news |title=Helicopter Safari in Africa |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nz8EAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false |work=[[Life (magazine)|Life]] |date=June 10, 1957 |accessdate=2016-01-06 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1959, Godfrey began suffering chest pains. Examination by physicians revealed a mass in his chest that could have been lung cancer. Surgeons discovered cancer in one lung that spread to his [[aorta]]. One lung was removed. Yet, despite the disease's discouragingly high mortality rate, it became clear after radiation treatments that Godfrey had beaten the substantial odds against him. He returned to the air on a prime-time  TV special but resumed the daily morning show on radio only, reverting to a format featuring guest stars such as ragtime pianist [[Max Morath]] and Irish vocalist Carmel Quinn, maintaining a live combo of first-rate Manhattan musicians (under the direction of Sy Mann) as he had done since the beginning. Godfrey also became a persuasive spokesman advocating regular medical checkups to detect cancer early, noting his cancer was cured only because it was discovered when still treatable.\n\nGodfrey's initial return to television occurred in a TV special centered on his gratitude to have survived what was by 1959 standards, an almost-certain death sentence. He sang, danced, did commercials and announced that he'd make greater use of the new [[videotape]] technology for the future. Despite appearing healthy on the broadcast, Godfrey, fearing the aftereffects of his illness would adversely affect his appearance, announced that he would resume the Monday\u2013Friday ''Arthur Godfrey Time'' on radio only, ending the daily TV broadcasts.\n\nLongtime announcer [[Tony Marvin]], with Godfrey since the late 1940s, did not make the transition to the new program. Marvin was one of Godfrey's few associates who left on amicable terms, and went on to a career as a radio  news anchor on the [[Mutual Broadcasting System]]. The Godfrey show was the last daily longform entertainment program on American network radio when Godfrey and CBS agreed to end it in April 1972, when his 20-year contract with the network expired. Godfrey by then was a colonel in the United States [[Air Force Reserve Command|Air Force Reserve]] and still an active pilot.\n\nHe appeared in the movies ''[[4 for Texas]]'' (1963), ''[[The Glass Bottom Boat]]'' (1966), and ''[[Where Angels Go, Trouble Follows]]'' (1968). He briefly co-hosted ''[[Candid Camera]]'' with creator [[Allen Funt]], but that relationship, like so many others, ended abruptly and acrimoniously; Godfrey hosted at least one broadcast ''without'' Funt. Godfrey also made various guest appearances, and he and [[Lucille Ball]] co-hosted the [[CBS]] special ''50 Years of Television'' (1978). He also made a [[cameo appearance]] in the 1979 [[B-movie]] ''[[Angels Revenge]]''.\n\n===Post-retirement===\nIn retirement, Godfrey wanted to find ways back onto a regular TV schedule. He appeared on the rock band [[Moby Grape]]'s song \"Just Like [[Gene Autry]]: A Foxtrot\", a 1920s-pop-style piece from their album [[Wow/Grape Jam|''Wow'']]. Godfrey's political outlook was complex, and to some, contradictory; his lifelong admiration for Franklin Roosevelt combined with a powerful [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] streak in his views and his open support for [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] as president. During his later years he became a powerful voice for the environmentalist movement who identified with the youth culture that irreverently opposed the \"establishment,\" as he felt he had done during his peak years. He renounced a lucrative endorsement deal with [[Colgate-Palmolive]] when it became clear to him that it clashed with his environmental principles. He had made commercials for [[Colgate (toothpaste)|Colgate]] toothpaste and the detergent Axion, only to repudiate the latter product when he found out that Axion [[Phosphates in detergent|contained phosphates]], implicated in water pollution. He did far fewer commercials after that incident.\n\nWhile Godfrey was a great fan of technology, including aviation and aerospace developments, he also found time for pursuits of an earlier era. He was a dedicated horseman and master at [[dressage]] and made charity appearances at horse shows.\n\nHe also found in later years that his enthusiasm for high-tech had its limits when he concluded that some technological developments posed the potential to threaten the environment. During one appearance on ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'', Godfrey commented that the United States needed the [[supersonic transport]] \"about as much as we need another bag of those clunkers from the moon.\"  The concern that the SST contributed to noise pollution, an issue Godfrey was instrumental in raising in the United States, is considered to have effectively ended [[Supersonic transport|SST]] interest in the U.S., leaving it to Britain and France. ([[Dick Cavett|Cavett]] claims that Godfrey's statement also earned tax audits from the [[Richard Nixon]]-era [[Internal Revenue Service]] for the show's entire production staff.)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/25/a-godfrey-a-man-for-a-long-long-season/ |title=A. Godfrey: A Man for a Long, Long Season |first=Dick |last=Cavett |publisher=New York Times Blogs |date=June 25, 2010 |accessdate=May 9, 2013}}</ref>\n\nDespite an intense desire to remain in the public eye, Godfrey's presence ebbed considerably over the next ten years, despite an [[HBO]] special and an appearance on a [[PBS]] salute to the 1950s. A 1981 attempt to reconcile him with LaRosa for a Godfrey show reunion record album, bringing together Godfrey and a number of the \"Little Godfreys,\" collapsed. Godfrey had initially resisted the idea, floated by his agent, but finally relented. At an initially amicable meeting, Godfrey reasserted that LaRosa wanted out of his contract and asked why he had not explained that instead of insisting he was fired without warning. When LaRosa began reminding him of the dance lesson controversy, Godfrey, then in his late seventies, exploded and the meeting ended in shambles.\n\n===The Arthur Godfrey Collection===\nToward the end of his life, Godfrey became a major supporter of [[public broadcasting]], and left his large personal archive of papers and programs to public station [[WNET|WNET/Thirteen]] in New York. Godfrey biographer Art Singer helped to arrange a permanent home for the Godfrey material at the [[Broadcasting Archives at the University of Maryland]] in early 1998. The collection contains hundreds of [[kinescope]]s of Godfrey television programs, more than 4,000 [[magnetic tape sound recording|audiotapes]] and [[wire recording]]s of his various radio shows, [[videotape]]s, and [[transcription disc]]s. The collection also contains Godfrey's voluminous personal papers and business records, which cover his spectacular rise and precipitous fall in the industry over a period of more than 50 years.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://digital.lib.umd.edu/archivesum/actions.DisplayEADDoc.do?source=/MdU.ead.lab.0035.xml&style=ead| title=Thirteen/WNET Arthur Godfrey Collection| publisher=the Special Collections Department of the University of Maryland Libraries| access-date=January 1, 2013| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622221245/http://digital.lib.umd.edu/archivesum/actions.DisplayEADDoc.do?source=%2FMdU.ead.lab.0035.xml&style=ead| archive-date=June 22, 2012| url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Death===\n[[Emphysema]], thought to have been caused by decades of smoking and the radiation treatments for Godfrey's lung cancer, became a problem in the early 1980s.

The nearest railway station is at [[Guindy]] which is about 6 kilometres away.

The channel once 40 feet wide drains surplus water from the Porur Lake as well as storm water into the Adyar River at Manapakkam. The problem, residents complained, was primarily due to the shrinking of the Manapakkam Channel.\n\nResidents of the Thiruvalluvar Nagar unable to reach homes as the  area is completely under water in the years 2005, 06, 08, 11 and 2015. Adding to the inundation is the problem of breaches in Manapakkam canal that runs 500 metres from the locality.

It is situated 16&nbsp;km south-west of [[Chennai]] on the [[Mount-Poonamallee Road]]. It is bounded by [[Porur]] on the north, [[Meenambakkam]] on the south and south east, and [[Ramapuram, Chennai|Ramapuram]] on the north east directions. The nearest railway station is at [[Guindy]] which is about 6 kilometres away. Porur junction is around 2&nbsp;km away and [[Kathipara Junction]] is around 5&nbsp;km away.\n\nThe word, ''Mugalivakkam'', might have evolved during the brief [[Mughal Empire|Mughal rule]] of [[Poonamallee]] during the later half of the 17th century CE and the 18th century CE.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mugalivakkam|url=http://www.mugalivakkam.com/}}</ref>\n\n==Recent developments==\nDLF IT City was built and opened next to Mugalivakkam in 2010. Multinational companies such as IBM, CTS, L&T and Infotech have been located in this IT City. L&T ECC, L&T Ship Building and L&T Audco are also vested in this area. Mugalivakkam is included in Chennai city limits from 2011. The availability of small parks, educational institutions, hospitals, banks and superstores identify itself as a decent residential area in this part of the city.\n\n==Flood prone==\nResidents of the M and M Thiruvalluvar Nagar (Mugalivakkam and Manapakkam) Residents Welfare Association said surplus water from the Pour Lake should drain into the Manapakkam Channel through Moulivakkam, Mugalivakkam, Madha Nagar, Rajeswari Avenue and Mahalakshmi Nagar. The channel once 40 feet wide drains surplus water from the Porur Lake as well as storm water into the Adyar River at Manapakkam. The problem, residents complained, was primarily due to the shrinking of the Manapakkam Channel.\n\nResidents of the Thiruvalluvar Nagar unable to reach homes as the  area is completely under water in the years 2005, 06, 08, 11 and 2015. Adding to the inundation is the problem of breaches in Manapakkam canal that runs 500 metres from the locality. Two breaches each five feet wide allow water from the canal to flow into Thiruvalluvar Nagar\n\n==Educational institutions==\n\n{{Empty section|date=February 2018}}\n\n===CBSE affiliated===\n\n*[https://www.omegaschools.org/ Omega International school]\n*[[Pon Vidyashram]]\n*[[Padma Seshadri Bala Bhavan]]\n*[[Velammal Bodhi Campus]]\n\n===Tamil Board Affiliated===\n\n*St. Ann's Matriculation Higher Secondary School \n*Government High School \n*M.K.M.

Everything Can Happen'' was originally released on LP and cassette by local record label [[Twin/Tone]] as a nine-song EP. It is out of print but was re-released on CD as ''[[Say What You Will, Clarence...Karl Sold the Truck]]'', which includes five additional tracks that were cut from the original album. Between the release of ''Say What You Will'' and their second album, [[Grant Young (musician)|Grant Young]] joined the group, taking over the drums from Morley.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> In 1986, Soul Asylum released three albums, ''[[Made to Be Broken]]'', ''[[Time's Incinerator]]'' (on cassette only) and ''[[While You Were Out (album)|While You Were Out]]''.\n\nThe band toured relentlessly in its early years, opening for other American touring bands and later performing as a headliner act after gaining exposure on the \"[[Flip Your Wig]]\" tour with the Minneapolis band [[H\u00fcsker D\u00fc]] in early 1986. Contrasted with some of the popular underground and alternative styles at the time, audiences were struck by the band's onstage swagger, scruffy Midwestern appearance and extremely loud, frenetic sound, mixing tuneful but unrestrained punk, hardcore, 1970s rock, country and self-effacing kitsch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mnhs.org/library/tips/history_topics/132soulasylum.htm |title=Soul Asylum : Library |website=Mnhs.Org |date= |accessdate=April 23, 2014}}</ref> One early review<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-04-07/entertainment/ca-21904_1_soul-asylum |title=Soul Asylum \u2013 Los Angeles Times |website=Articles.latimes.com |date=May 24, 1998 |accessdate=April 23, 2014}}</ref> described their sound as \"some unholy mix of Kiss and Hank Williams thrown under the wheels of a runaway train.\" All elements contributed to the band's being described as a \"[[grunge]] precursor\", a claim often recited in comparisons between pre-Nirvana Minneapolis and Seattle bands. Despite critical acclaim locally and internationally, they remained unknown to a larger U.S. audience and radio market.\n\n===Mainstream popularity and success: 1988-1999===\n[[File:DavePirner.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Dave Pirner at a Soul Asylum concert in Germany in 1990]]\nThe group signed with [[A&M Records]] in 1988. Their first offering on that label was ''[[Clam Dip & Other Delights]]'' (1989), the title and cover art being a parody of ''[[Whipped Cream & Other Delights]]'', by A&M Records co-founder [[Herb Alpert]]. ''[[Hang Time (album)|Hang Time]]'' was released in 1988, followed by ''[[And the Horse They Rode In On]]'' in 1990 (produced by [[X-pensive Winos]] drummer [[Steve Jordan (musician)|Steve Jordan]]). Because of poor sales and Pirner's hearing problems, the group considered disbanding.\n\nIn 1992, the band paid an undisclosed amount for rewriting and publishing the song \u201cSomebody To Shove\u201d when it was revealed they had taken the song from another local band, Glass Alice, during a jam session with writer Patrick Bedney and singer Chris Dahlkvist. The suit was settled after a video revealed that the lyrics in Bedney\u2019s and Dahlkvist\u2019 performance were identical to the published song. \n\nAfter playing a series of acoustic shows in the early 1990s, they were picked up by [[Columbia Records]]. In 1992 they released ''[[Grave Dancers Union]]'', which became their most popular album.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> On January 20, 1993, the group performed at the first [[inauguration]] of United States President [[Bill Clinton]]. Later that year, the band performed \"Sexual Healing\" for the AIDS benefit album ''[[No Alternative]]'', produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]]. The band added keyboard player Joey Huffman in the summer of 1993. He toured with the band until joining [[Matchbox Twenty]] in 1998. Huffman played on the albums ''[[Let Your Dim Light Shine]]'', ''[[After the Flood: Live from the Grand Forks Prom, June 28, 1997]]'', and ''[[The Silver Lining (Soul Asylum album)|The Silver Lining]]''. Soul Asylum won the 1994 [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Song]] for \"[[Runaway Train (Soul Asylum song)|Runaway Train]]\". The music video for that song featured photographs and names of missing children, in the style of a public service announcement. At the end of the video, Pirner appeared and said, \"If you've seen one of these kids, or you are one of them, please call this number\", and then the telephone number of a missing children's help line was shown. For use outside the U.S., the video was edited to include photos and names of missing children from the area where the video would be shown. The video was instrumental in reuniting several children with their families.<ref name=PW>{{cite web |url=http://www.pasadenaweekly.com/article.php?id=3638&IssueNum=28 |title=Back on track |publisher=Pasadena Weekly |date=July 13, 2006 |accessdate=April 23, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221164621/http://www.pasadenaweekly.com/article.php?id=3638&IssueNum=28 |archivedate=December 21, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nBefore their next studio album, drummer Grant Young was fired and was replaced by [[Sterling Campbell]].<ref name=\"Larkin90\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Nineties Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2000|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0427-8|page=366}}</ref> Campbell had been credited as providing percussion on ''Grave Dancers Union'' (although he had actually done at least half of the drumming on that album).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sjmc.cla.umn.edu/stupro/resonance/article-1.htm |title=School of Journalism & Mass Communication : University of Minnesota |website=Sjmc.cla.umn.edu |date=April 1, 2014 |accessdate=April 23, 2014}}</ref> The next release, ''[[Let Your Dim Light Shine]]'', included the track \"[[Misery (Soul Asylum song)|Misery]]\", which reached the Top 20, but the album was not as successful as the band's previous one.

Everything Can Happen'' was originally released on LP and cassette by local record label [[Twin/Tone]] as a nine-song EP. It is out of print but was re-released on CD as ''[[Say What You Will, Clarence...Karl Sold the Truck]]'', which includes five additional tracks that were cut from the original album. Between the release of ''Say What You Will'' and their second album, [[Grant Young (musician)|Grant Young]] joined the group, taking over the drums from Morley.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> In 1986, Soul Asylum released three albums, ''[[Made to Be Broken]]'', ''[[Time's Incinerator]]'' (on cassette only) and ''[[While You Were Out (album)|While You Were Out]]''.\n\nThe band toured relentlessly in its early years, opening for other American touring bands and later performing as a headliner act after gaining exposure on the \"[[Flip Your Wig]]\" tour with the Minneapolis band [[H\u00fcsker D\u00fc]] in early 1986. Contrasted with some of the popular underground and alternative styles at the time, audiences were struck by the band's onstage swagger, scruffy Midwestern appearance and extremely loud, frenetic sound, mixing tuneful but unrestrained punk, hardcore, 1970s rock, country and self-effacing kitsch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mnhs.org/library/tips/history_topics/132soulasylum.htm |title=Soul Asylum : Library |website=Mnhs.Org |date= |accessdate=April 23, 2014}}</ref> One early review<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-04-07/entertainment/ca-21904_1_soul-asylum |title=Soul Asylum \u2013 Los Angeles Times |website=Articles.latimes.com |date=May 24, 1998 |accessdate=April 23, 2014}}</ref> described their sound as \"some unholy mix of Kiss and Hank Williams thrown under the wheels of a runaway train.\" All elements contributed to the band's being described as a \"[[grunge]] precursor\", a claim often recited in comparisons between pre-Nirvana Minneapolis and Seattle bands. Despite critical acclaim locally and internationally, they remained unknown to a larger U.S. audience and radio market.\n\n===Mainstream popularity and success: 1988-1995===\n[[File:DavePirner.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Dave Pirner at a Soul Asylum concert in Germany in 1990]]\nThe group signed with [[A&M Records]] in 1988. Their first offering on that label was ''[[Clam Dip & Other Delights]]'' (1989), the title and cover art being a parody of ''[[Whipped Cream & Other Delights]]'', by A&M Records co-founder [[Herb Alpert]]. ''[[Hang Time (album)|Hang Time]]'' was released in 1988, followed by ''[[And the Horse They Rode In On]]'' in 1990 (produced by [[X-pensive Winos]] drummer [[Steve Jordan (musician)|Steve Jordan]]). Because of poor sales and Pirner's hearing problems, the group considered disbanding.\n\nIn 1992, the band paid an undisclosed amount for rewriting and publishing the song \u201cSomebody To Shove\u201d when it was revealed they had taken the song from another local band, Glass Alice, during a jam session with writer Patrick Bedney and singer Chris Dahlkvist. The suit was settled after a video revealed that the lyrics in Bedney\u2019s and Dahlkvist\u2019 performance were identical to the published song. \n\nAfter playing a series of acoustic shows in the early 1990s, they were picked up by [[Columbia Records]]. In 1992 they released ''[[Grave Dancers Union]]'', which became their most popular album.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> On January 20, 1993, the group performed at the first [[inauguration]] of United States President [[Bill Clinton]]. Later that year, the band performed \"Sexual Healing\" for the AIDS benefit album ''[[No Alternative]]'', produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]]. The band added keyboard player Joey Huffman in the summer of 1993. He toured with the band until joining [[Matchbox Twenty]] in 1998. Huffman played on the albums ''[[Let Your Dim Light Shine]]'', ''[[After the Flood: Live from the Grand Forks Prom, June 28, 1997]]'', and ''[[The Silver Lining (Soul Asylum album)|The Silver Lining]]''. Soul Asylum won the 1994 [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Song]] for \"[[Runaway Train (Soul Asylum song)|Runaway Train]]\". The music video for that song featured photographs and names of missing children, in the style of a public service announcement. At the end of the video, Pirner appeared and said, \"If you've seen one of these kids, or you are one of them, please call this number\", and then the telephone number of a missing children's help line was shown. For use outside the U.S., the video was edited to include photos and names of missing children from the area where the video would be shown. The video was instrumental in reuniting several children with their families.<ref name=PW>{{cite web |url=http://www.pasadenaweekly.com/article.php?id=3638&IssueNum=28 |title=Back on track |publisher=Pasadena Weekly |date=July 13, 2006 |accessdate=April 23, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221164621/http://www.pasadenaweekly.com/article.php?id=3638&IssueNum=28 |archivedate=December 21, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nBefore their next studio album, drummer Grant Young was fired and was replaced by [[Sterling Campbell]].<ref name=\"Larkin90\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Nineties Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2000|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0427-8|page=366}}</ref> Campbell had been credited as providing percussion on ''Grave Dancers Union'' (although he had actually done at least half of the drumming on that album).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sjmc.cla.umn.edu/stupro/resonance/article-1.htm |title=School of Journalism & Mass Communication : University of Minnesota |website=Sjmc.cla.umn.edu |date=April 1, 2014 |accessdate=April 23, 2014}}</ref> The next release, ''[[Let Your Dim Light Shine]]'', included the track \"[[Misery (Soul Asylum song)|Misery]]\", which reached the Top 20, but the album was not as successful as the band's previous one.
