The series was a single 26 episode saga that premiered in Germany and other parts of Europe from 1980 to 1981. In 1982, Filmation carried the show over to the [[United States]] for [[Television syndication|syndication]], and as a summer replacement in [[NBC]]'s Saturday morning children's programming.<ref>Lenburg, Jeff, ''Encyclopedia of Animated Cartoons'', Second Edition, 1999.</ref> It was the last first-run series produced by [[Filmation Associates]] to air on NBC.\n\n==Overview==\nSport Billy was originally a European [[comic]] character and it already had a presence in [[Europe]] and parts of [[Latin America]]. '''Sport Billy Productions''', owners of the Sport Billy franchise, licensed the property to the [[United States|American]] studio Filmation so it could create a cartoon based on the character. As a European character, Sport Billy's main sport was [[association football|soccer]], and this was reflected in the introductory sequence of the Filmation program.\n\nSport Billy was adopted by [[FIFA]] as the Fair Play Mascot for FIFA World Cups, and a [[trophy]] of the character was presented to the most sporting team at each [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]. The character was internationally used as a [[mascot]] in many sporting youth programs, for the purpose of promoting [[sportmanship|sportsmanship and fair play]] .\n\nThe series consisted of 26 episodes. It was also shown in the [[UK]], [[France]], [[Gibraltar]], [[Italy]], [[Yugoslavia]], [[Brazil]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Greece]], [[Cyprus]], [[Spain]], [[Turkey]], [[Peru]], [[Mexico]], [[Portugal]], [[Romania]] and some other countries. Sport Billy was voiced by Lane Scheimer, the son of producer [[Lou Scheimer]], who voiced the Master Sports Computer and Queen Vanda's Computer. Lilly and Queen Vanda were voiced by [[Joyce Bulifant]], Willy, Sporticus XI and Sipe were voiced by [[Frank Welker]], and Queen Pandusa was voiced by Jay Scheimer.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe story revolves around a young boy named Sport Billy who is from the planet Olympus (a [[Counter-Earth|twin of Earth]] on the opposite side of the Sun) which is populated by athletic god-like beings. Billy himself has a magic size-changing gym bag - the Omni-Sack - which produces various tools as he needs them. He travels to Earth on a mission to promote teamwork and sportsmanship. Described by the show's theme song as a \"hero from another planet\", Billy battles the evil Queen Vanda and her [[gnome]]-like [[henchman]], Sipe. Vanda's mission is to destroy all [[sports]] in the galaxy since fairness disgusts her.\n\nBilly is assisted by two faithful companions, a girl named Lilly and a talking dog named Willy. The trio travels around in a [[time travel]]ing [[spacecraft|spaceship]], which is mounted on two rocket engines and resembles a giant wind-up clock, complete with a ringing bell.  In each episode the trio travels through time in order to save a different Earth sport from Queen Vanda's grasp.\n\n==Episode list==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background:#FFFFFF\"\n|- style=\"color:#FFFFFF\"\n! style=\"background:#000070; width:20px\"| N\u00ba\n! style=\"background:#000070\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#000070; width:130px\"| Original air date\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 1\n| Title = Joust in Time\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1982|7|6|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary = \n| LineColor = 000070\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 2\n| Title = Trouble in Tokyo\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1982|7|7|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary = \n| LineColor = 000070\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 3\n| Title = Mexican Holiday\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1982|7|8|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary = \n| LineColor = 000070\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 4\n| Title = Return to Olympus\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1982|7|9|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary = \n| LineColor = 000070\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 5\n| Title = Chinese Puzzle\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1982|7|12|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary = \n| LineColor = 000070\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 6\n| Title = Teamwork\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1982|7|13|df=y}} \n| ShortSummary = \n| LineColor = 000070\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 7\n| Title = Bad Weather Blues\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1982|7|14|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary = \n| LineColor = 000070\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 8\n| Title = A Voice in the Wilderness\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1982|7|15|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary = \n| LineColor = 000070\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 9\n| Title = Wheel of Fortune\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1982|7|16|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary = \n| LineColor = 000070\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 10\n| Title = Hyde and Seek\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1982|7|19|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary = \n| LineColor = 000070\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 11\n| Title = Power of the Omnisac\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1982|7|20|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary = \n| LineColor = 000070\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 12\n| Title = A Race in Space\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1982|7|21|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary = \n| LineColor = 000070\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 13\n| Title = Trial by Fire\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1982|7|22|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary = \n| LineColor = 000070\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 14\n| Title = The Great Texas Hole in One\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1982|7|23|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary = \n| LineColor = 000070\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 15\n| Title = Arabian Knights and Days\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1982|7|26|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary = \n| LineColor = 000070\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 16\n| Title = Mixed Doubles\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1982|7|27|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary = \n| LineColor = 000070\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 17\n| Title = Viking for a Day\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1982|7|28|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary = \n| LineColor = 000070\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 18\n| Title = Monster from the Loch\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1982|7|29|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary = \n| LineColor = 000070\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 19\n| Title = Mystery of the Russian Cave\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1982|7|30|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary = \n| LineColor = 000070\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 20\n| Title = Rah!

Previously,  many hydrocarbons having the empirical formula C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>16</sub> had been called \"camphene\", but many other hydrocarbons of the same composition had had different names.  Hence Kekul\u00e9 coined the term \"terpene\" in order to reduce the confusion.\nSee:  \n* {{cite book |last1=Kekul\u00e9 |first1=August |title=Lehrbuch der organischen Chemie |trans-title=Textbook of Organic Chemistry |date=1866 |publisher=Ferdinand Enke |location=Erlangen, (Germany) |volume= vol. 2 |pages=464\u2013465 |language=German |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IbBmZDznuPsC&pg=PA464#v=onepage&q&f=false}}  From pp. 464\u2013465:  ''\"Mit dem Namen Terpene bezeichnen wir \u2026 unter verschiedenen Namen aufgef\u00fchrt werden.\"'' (By the name \"terpene\" we designate in general the hydrocarbons composed according to the [empirical] formula C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>16</sub> (see \u00a7. 1540).

In general, a great confusion prevails in the designation of substances belonging here [i.e., to the terpene group].

The '''biogenetic isoprene rule''' or the '''C<sub>5</sub> rule''' was described in 1953, by [[Leopold Ru\u017ei\u010dka]], who explained that terpinoids can be visualized as the result of linking isoprene units \"head to tail\" to form chains, which can be arranged to form rings.<ref>{{cite journal |title = The isoprene rule and the Biogenesis of terpenic compounds |first = Leopold |last = Ru\u017ei\u010dka|journal = Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences|volume = 9|issue = 10|pages = 357\u2013367 |year = 1953 |doi = 10.1007/BF02167631 |pmid = 13116962 }}</ref>\n\nThere are two [[metabolic pathway]]s that create terpenoids:\n\n====Mevalonic acid pathway====\n{{Main|Mevalonate pathway}}\nMany organisms manufacture terpenoids through the HMG-CoA reductase pathway, known as the Mevalonate pathway, \nwhich also produces [[cholesterol]]. One of the intermediates in this pathway is [[mevalonic acid]]. The reactions take place in the [[cytosol]]. The pathway was discovered in the 1950s.\n\n====MEP/DOXP pathway====\n{{Main|Non-mevalonate pathway}}\nThe 2-''C''-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate/1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate pathway (MEP/DOXP pathway), also known as non-mevalonate pathway or mevalonic acid-independent pathway, takes place in the [[plastid]]s of plants and [[apicomplexa]]n protozoa, as well as in many [[bacteria]]. It was discovered in the late 1980s.\n\n[[Pyruvate]] and [[glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate]] are converted by DOXP synthase (Dxs) to 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate, and by DOXP reductase (Dxr, IspC) to 2-''C''-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP). The subsequent three reaction steps catalyzed by 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-''C''-methyl-D-erythritol synthase (YgbP, IspD), 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-''C''-methyl-D-erythritol kinase (YchB, IspE), and 2-''C''-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase (YgbB, IspF) mediate the formation of 2-''C''-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclopyrophosphate (MEcPP). Finally, MEcPP is converted to (''E'')-4-hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enyl pyrophosphate ([[HMB-PP]]) by HMB-PP synthase (GcpE, IspG), and HMB-PP is converted to [[isopentenyl pyrophosphate]] (IPP) and [[dimethylallyl pyrophosphate]] (DMAPP) by HMB-PP reductase (LytB, IspH).\n\nIPP and DMAPP are the end-products in either pathway, and are the precursors of [[isoprene]], monoterpenoids (10-carbon), diterpenoids (20-carbon), [[carotenoid]]s (40-carbon), [[chlorophyll]]s, and [[plastoquinone]]-9 (45-carbon). Synthesis of all higher terpenoids proceeds via formation of [[geranyl pyrophosphate]] (GPP), [[farnesyl pyrophosphate]] (FPP), and [[geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate]] (GGPP).\n\nThe MVA and MEP are mutually exclusive in most organisms.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

One of the intermediates in this pathway is [[mevalonic acid]]. The reactions take place in the [[cytosol]]. The pathway was discovered in the 1950s.\n\n====MEP/DOXP pathway====\n{{Main|Non-mevalonate pathway}}\nThe 2-''C''-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate/1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate pathway (MEP/DOXP pathway), also known as non-mevalonate pathway or mevalonic acid-independent pathway, takes place in the [[plastid]]s of plants and [[apicomplexa]]n protozoa, as well as in many [[bacteria]]. It was discovered in the late 1980s.\n\n[[Pyruvate]] and [[glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate]] are converted by DOXP synthase (Dxs) to 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate, and by DOXP reductase (Dxr, IspC) to 2-''C''-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP). The subsequent three reaction steps catalyzed by 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-''C''-methyl-D-erythritol synthase (YgbP, IspD), 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-''C''-methyl-D-erythritol kinase (YchB, IspE), and 2-''C''-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase (YgbB, IspF) mediate the formation of 2-''C''-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclopyrophosphate (MEcPP). Finally, MEcPP is converted to (''E'')-4-hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enyl pyrophosphate ([[HMB-PP]]) by HMB-PP synthase (GcpE, IspG), and HMB-PP is converted to [[isopentenyl pyrophosphate]] (IPP) and [[dimethylallyl pyrophosphate]] (DMAPP) by HMB-PP reductase (LytB, IspH).\n\nIPP and DMAPP are the end-products in either pathway, and are the precursors of [[isoprene]], monoterpenoids (10-carbon), diterpenoids (20-carbon), [[carotenoid]]s (40-carbon), [[chlorophyll]]s, and [[plastoquinone]]-9 (45-carbon). Synthesis of all higher terpenoids proceeds via formation of [[geranyl pyrophosphate]] (GPP), [[farnesyl pyrophosphate]] (FPP), and [[geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate]] (GGPP).\n\nThe MVA and MEP are mutually exclusive in most organisms.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Diterpenes also form the basis for biologically important compounds such as [[retinol]], [[retinal]], and [[phytol]].\n* '''Sesterterpenes''', terpenes having 25 carbons and ''five isoprene'' units, are rare relative to the other sizes. (The ''sester-'' prefix means two and a half.) An example of a sesterterpenoid is [[geranylfarnesol]].\n* '''[[Triterpene]]s''' consist of ''six isoprene'' units and have the molecular formula C<sub>30</sub>H<sub>48</sub>. The linear triterpene [[squalene]], the major constituent of [[shark liver oil]], is derived from the reductive coupling of two molecules of [[farnesyl pyrophosphate]]. Squalene is then processed biosynthetically to generate either [[lanosterol]] or [[cycloartenol]], the structural precursors to all the [[steroid]]s.\n* '''Sesquarterpenes''' are composed of ''seven isoprene'' units and have the molecular formula C<sub>35</sub>H<sub>56</sub>. Sesquarterpenes are typically microbial in their origin. Examples of sesquarterpenoids are ferrugicadiol and tetraprenylcurcumene.\n* '''[[Tetraterpene]]s''' contain ''eight isoprene'' units and have the molecular formula C<sub>40</sub>H<sub>64</sub>. Biologically important tetraterpenoids include the acyclic [[lycopene]], the monocyclic [[gamma-carotene]], and the bicyclic [[alpha-carotene|alpha-]] and [[beta-carotene]]s.\n* '''Polyterpenes''' consist of long chains of ''many isoprene'' units. Natural [[rubber]] consists of polyisoprene in which the double bonds are [[Cis\u2013trans isomerism|''cis'']]. Some plants produce a polyisoprene with ''trans'' double bonds, known as [[gutta-percha]].\n* '''Norisoprenoids''', such as the C<sub>13</sub>-norisoprenoids [[3-oxo-\u03b1-ionol]] present in [[Muscat of Alexandria]] leaves and [[7,8-dihydroionone]] derivatives, such as [[megastigmane-3,9-diol]] and [[3-oxo-7,8-dihydro-\u03b1-ionol]] found in [[Shiraz (grape)|Shiraz]] leaves (both grapes in the species ''[[Vitis vinifera]]'')<ref>{{Cite book|doi=10.1021/bk-2002-0802.ch018|title=Carotenoid-Derived Aroma Compounds;

Consequently, they are produced by chemical synthesis, usually from [[petrochemical]]s. In one route, acetone and acetylene are condensed to give [[2-Methylbut-3-yn-2-ol]], which is extended with acetoacetic ester to give geranyl alcohol. Others are prepared from those terpenes and terpenoids that are readily isolated in quantity, say from the paper and [[tall oil]] industries. For example, [[alpha-Pinene|\u03b1-pinene]], which is readily obtainable from natural sources, is converted to [[citronellal]] and [[camphor]]. Citronellal is also converted to [[rose oxide]] and [[menthol]].<ref name=book/>\n[[File:IndustrialRouteGeranylAlc.png|thumb|424px|center|Summary of an industrial route to geranyl alcohol from simple reagents.]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons|Terpenes}}\n*[http://www.chemie.fu-berlin.de/chemistry/oc/terpene/terpene_en.html Institute of Chemistry - terpenes]\n*[http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme/glossary/pinene.html Structures of alpha pinene and beta pinene]\n*{{MeshName|Terpenes}}\n\n{{Terpenoids}}\n{{Terpenes}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Terpenes and terpenoids| ]]\n[[Category:Plant communication]]\n", "name_user": "Karieol51", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terpene"}

The technique has been used in many fields to remove a [[wikt:background|background]] from the subject of a photo or video \u2013 particularly the [[news]]casting, [[motion picture]], and [[video game]] industries. A colour range in the foreground footage is made transparent, allowing separately filmed background footage or a static image to be inserted into the scene. The chroma keying technique is commonly used in [[video production]] and post-production. This technique is also referred to as '''colour keying''', '''colour-separation overlay''' ('''CSO'''; primarily by the [[BBC]]<ref name=\"What is Chroma Key?\">{{cite web |url=http://lumeo.com.au/chroma-key/ |title=What is Chroma Key?|publisher=Lumeo |access-date=3 July 2014}}</ref>), or by various terms for specific colour-related variants such as '''green screen''', '''blue screen''' and '''magic pink'''; chroma keying can be done with backgrounds of any colour that are uniform and distinct, but green and blue backgrounds are more commonly used because they differ most distinctly in hue from [[human skin colour]]s. No part of the subject being filmed or photographed may duplicate the colour used as the backing, otherwise, the part may be erroneously identified as part of the backing.<ref name=\"BorisFX\" />\n\nIt is commonly used for [[weather forecasting|weather forecast]] [[broadcast]]s, wherein a [[news presenter]] is usually seen standing in front of a large [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] map during live television [[newscast]]s, though in actuality it is a large blue or green background. When using a blue screen, different weather maps are added on the parts of the image where the colour is blue. If the news presenter wears blue clothes, his or her clothes will also be replaced with the background video. Chroma keying is also common in the entertainment industry for visual effects in [[movies]] and video games. [[Rotoscopy]] may instead be carried out on subjects that aren't in front of a green (or blue) screen. [[Match moving|Motion tracking]] can also be used in conjunction with chroma keying, for example to move the background as the subject moves.\n\n==History==\n\n===Predecessors===\n\nPrior to the introduction of [[Matte (filmmaking)|travelling mattes]] and [[optical printer|optical printing]], [[double exposure]] was used to introduce elements into a scene which were not present in the initial exposure. This was done using black draping where a green screen would be used today. [[George Albert Smith (film pioneer)|George Albert Smith]] first used this approach in 1898. In 1903, ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' by [[Edwin Stanton Porter|Edwin S. Porter]] used double exposure to add background scenes to windows which were black when filmed on set, using a [[garbage matte]] to expose only the window areas.<ref>{{cite book | title=Experimental Filmmaking: Break the Machine | author=Kathryn Ramey | page=70 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XYRICgAAQBAJ&pg=PA70| isbn=9781136071508 | date=2015-07-30 }}</ref>\n\nIn order to have figures in one exposure actually move in front of a substituted background in the other, a travelling matte was needed, to occlude the correct portion of the background in each frame. In 1918 [[Frank D. Williams (cinematographer)|Frank Williams]] patented a travelling matte technique, again based on using a black background. This was used in many films, such as ''[[The Invisible Man (1933 film)|The Invisible Man]]''.<ref name=Foster />{{rp|4}}\n\nIn the 1920s, [[Walt Disney]] used a white backdrop to include human actors with cartoon characters and backgrounds in his ''[[Alice Comedies]]''.<ref name=Foster />{{rp|5}}\n\n===Bluescreen===\nThe blue screen method was developed in the 1930s at [[RKO Radio Pictures]].  At RKO, [[Linwood Dunn]] used an early version of the [[Matte (filmmaking)|travelling matte]] to create \"wipes\" \u2013 where there were transitions like a windshield wiper in films such as ''[[Flying Down to Rio]]'' (1933). Credited to [[Lawrence W. Butler|Larry Butler]], a scene featuring a genie escaping from a bottle was the first use of a proper bluescreen process to create a traveling matte for ''[[The Thief of Bagdad (1940 film)|The Thief of Bagdad]]'' (1940), which won the [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Academy Award for Best Special Effects]] that year. In 1950, [[Warner Brothers]] employee and ex-[[Kodak]] researcher [[Arthur Widmer]] began working on an [[ultraviolet]] travelling matte process. He also began developing bluescreen techniques: one of the first films to use them was the [[The Old Man and the Sea (1958 film)|1958 adaptation]] of the [[Ernest Hemingway]] novella, ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'', starring [[Spencer Tracy]].<ref name=\"cri\">{{cite web|url=http://en.chinabroadcast.cn/2246/2005-2-14/90@206385.htm|title=Illusions Take Home First Oscars|date=14 February 2005|publisher=[[China Radio International|CRI English]]|accessdate=21 January 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050315004609/http://en.chinabroadcast.cn/2246/2005-2-14/90%40206385.htm|archivedate=15 March 2005|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[Petro Vlahos]] was awarded an Academy Award for his refinement of these techniques in 1964. His technique exploits the fact that most objects in real-world scenes have a colour whose blue-colour component is similar in intensity to their green-colour component. [[Zbigniew Rybczy\u0144ski]] also contributed to bluescreen technology. An [[optical printer]] with two projectors, a film camera and a 'beam splitter', was used to combine the actor in front of a blue screen together with the background footage, one frame at a time. In the early 1970s, American and British television networks began using green backdrops instead of blue for their newscasts. During the 1980s, [[minicomputer]]s were used to control the optical printer. For the film ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', [[Richard Edlund]] created a 'quad optical printer' that accelerated the process considerably and saved money. He received a special [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for his innovation.\n\nFor decades, travelling matte shots had to be done \"locked-down\", so that neither the matted subject nor the background could shift their camera perspective at all.  Later, computer-timed, [[Motion control photography|motion-control]] cameras alleviated this problem, as both the foreground and background could be filmed with the same camera moves.\n\nMeteorologists on television often use a field monitor, to the side of the screen, to see where they are putting their hands against the background images. A newer technique is to project a faint image onto the screen.\n\nSome films make heavy use of chroma key to add backgrounds that are constructed entirely using [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI). Performances from different takes can be composited together, which allows actors to be filmed separately and then placed together in the same scene. Chroma key allows performers to appear to be in any location without leaving the studio. \nComputer development also made it easier to [[camera tracking|incorporate motion]] into composited shots, even when using handheld cameras. Reference-points can be placed onto the coloured background (usually as a painted grid, X's marked with tape, or equally spaced tennis balls attached to the wall).  In post-production, a computer can use the references to compute the camera's position and thus render an image that matches the perspective and movement of the foreground perfectly.  Modern advances in software and computational power have eliminated the need to accurately place the markers \u2013 the software figures out their position in space (a disadvantage of this is that it requires a large camera movement, possibly encouraging modern film techniques where the camera is always in motion).\n\n==Process==\n[[File:SpiderwickChroniclesSet.jpg|thumb|right|267px|Film set for ''[[The Spiderwick Chronicles (film)|The Spiderwick Chronicles]]'', where a visual effects scene using bluescreen chroma key is in preparation]]\n\nThe principal subject is filmed or photographed against a background consisting of a single colour or a relatively narrow range of colours, usually blue or green because these colours are considered to be the furthest away from skin tone.<ref name=\"BorisFX\">{{cite web|url=http://www.borisfx.com/tutorials/chroma_key.php|title=The Chroma Effect|work=Chroma Key Tutorial|publisher=BorisFX|quote=If the foreground is a person then blue or green backing colour is recommended as these colours are not present in human flesh pigments.

This process is commonly known as \"[[keying (graphics)|keying]]\", \"keying out\" or simply a \"key\".\n\n===Processing a green backdrop===\n[[File:VirtuellesStudio Greenbox.jpg|thumb|right|267px|Virtual television studio with green-screen technique. The high amount of contrast between different parts of the screen is not ideal (see [[Chroma key#Even lighting|even lighting]]). Green reflections from the desk would create undesirable artifacts.]]\n\nGreen is used as a backdrop for TV and electronic cinematography more than any other colour because television weathermen tended to wear blue suits. When chroma keying first came into use in television production, the blue screen that was then the norm in the movie industry was used out of habit, until other practical considerations caused the television industry to move from blue to green screens. Broadcast quality colour television cameras use separate red, green and blue image sensors, and early analog TV chroma keyers required RGB component video to work reliably. From a technological perspective it was equally possible to use the blue or green channel, but because blue clothing was an ongoing challenge, the green screen came into common use. Newscasters sometimes forget the chroma key dress code, and when the key is applied to clothing of the same colour as the background, the person would seem to disappear into the key. Because green clothing is less common than blue, it soon became apparent that it was easier to use a green matte screen than it was to constantly police the clothing choices of on-air talent.   Also, because the human eye is more sensitive to green wavelengths, which lie in the middle of the visible light spectrum, the green analog video channel typically carried more signal strength, giving a better signal to noise ratio compared to the other component video channels, so green screen keys could produce the cleanest key. In the digital television and cinema age, much of the tweaking that was required to make a good quality key has been automated. However, the one constant that remains is some level of colour coordination to keep foreground subjects from being keyed out.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.videomaker.com/article/f5/13055-the-keys-to-chromakey-how-to-use-a-green-screen |title=The Keys To Chromakey: How To Use A Green Screen|publisher=Videomaker |accessdate=23 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Processing a blue backdrop===\nBefore electronic chroma keying, compositing was done on (chemical) film. The camera colour negative was printed onto high-contrast black and white negative, using either a filter or the high contrast film's colour sensitivity to expose only blue (and higher) frequencies. Blue light only shines through the colour negative where there is ''not'' blue in the scene, so this left the film clear where the blue screen was, and opaque elsewhere, except it also produced clear for any white objects (since they also contained blue). Removing these spots could be done by a suitable double-exposure with the colour positive (thus turning any area containing red or green opaque), and many other techniques. The end result was film that was clear where the blue screen was, and opaque everywhere else. This is called a ''female matte'', similar to an ''[[alpha matte]]'' in digital keying. Copying this film onto another high-contrast negative produced the opposite ''male matte''. The background negative was then packed with the female matte and exposed onto a final strip of film, then the camera negative was packed with the male matte was double-printed onto this same film. These two images combined together creates the final effect.\n\n===Major factors===\nThe most important factor for a key is the colour separation of the foreground (the subject) and background (the screen)&nbsp;\u2013 a blue screen will be used if the subject is predominantly green (for example plants), despite the camera being more sensitive to green light.\n\nIn [[Analog television|analog color TV]], colour is represented by the phase of the chroma [[Subcarrier#Television|subcarrier]] relative to a reference oscillator. Chroma key is achieved by comparing the phase of the video to the phase corresponding to the pre-selected colour. In-phase portions of the video are replaced by the alternate background video.\n\nIn [[Digital television|digital color TV]], colour is represented by three numbers (red, green, blue intensity levels). Chroma key is achieved by a simple numerical comparison between the video and the pre-selected colour. If the colour at a particular point on the screen matches (either exactly, or in a range), then the video at that point is replaced by the alternate background.\n\n====Lighting====\nIn order to create an illusion that characters and objects filmed are present in the intended background scene, the lighting in the two scenes must be a reasonable match. For outdoor scenes, overcast days create a diffuse, evenly coloured light which can be easier to match in the studio, whereas direct sunlight needs to be matched in both direction and overall colour based on time of day.\n\nA studio shot taken in front of a green screen will naturally have ambient light the same colour as the screen, due to its light scattering. This effect is known as ''spill''.<ref name=Foster />{{rp|p20}} This can look unnatural or cause portions of the characters to disappear, so must be compensated for, or avoided by using a larger screen placed far from the actors.<ref>{{Cite book |last1= Aronson |first1= David |authorlink1= David Aronson |title= DV Filmmaking: From Start to Finish, Volume 1 |year= 2006 |publisher= O'Reilly Media, Inc. |isbn= 978-0596008482 |pages= [https://archive.org/details/dvfilmmakingfrom0000aron/page/52 52\u201353] |url= https://archive.org/details/dvfilmmakingfrom0000aron/page/52 }}</ref>\n\n====Camera====\nThe depth of field used to record the scene in front of the coloured screen should match that of the background. This can mean recording the actors with a larger depth of field than normal.<ref name=\"bermingham\">{{Cite book | first= Alan | last=Bermingham | title= Location Lighting for Television | year= 2013 | publisher=Focal Press | isbn=978-0-240-51937-1 | page= 42 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7bAcAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA42}}</ref>\n\n==Clothing==\n{{multiple image\n| footer = Girl wearing blue clothing in front of green screen. The shadows cast onto the green screen are not ideal (see [[Chroma key#Even lighting|even lighting]].)\n| image1 = Girl in front of a green background.jpg\n| width1 = {{#expr: (260 * 640 / 960) round 0}}\n| image2 = Girl in room, green screen example.jpg\n| width2 = {{#expr: (260 * 707 / 892) round 0}}\n}}\nA chroma key subject must avoid wearing clothes which are similar in colour to the chroma key colour(s) (unless intentional e.g., wearing a green top to make it appear that the subject has no body), because the clothing may be replaced with the background image/video. An example of intentional use of this is when an actor wears a blue covering over a part of his body to make it invisible in the final shot. This technique can be used to achieve an effect similar to that used in the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' films to create the effect of an [[Cloak of invisibility|invisibility cloak]]. The actor can also be filmed against a chroma-key background and inserted into the background shot with a distortion effect, in order to create a cloak that is marginally detectable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.creativecow.net/articles/stern_eran/Invisible_Cape.php |title=Creating an invisible cape in After Effects |publisher=Library.creativecow.net |accessdate=20 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nDifficulties emerge with blue screen when a costume in an effects shot must be blue, such as [[Superman]]'s traditional blue outfit.  In the 2002 film ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'', in scenes where both [[Spider-Man]] and the [[Green Goblin]] are in the air, Spider-Man had to be shot in front of the green screen and the Green Goblin had to be shot in front of a blue screen. The colour difference is because Spider-Man wears a costume which is red and blue in colour and the Green Goblin wears a costume which is entirely green in colour. If both were shot in front of the same screen, parts of one character would be erased from the shot.\n\nFor a clean division of foreground from background, it is also important that clothing and hair in the foreground shot have a fairly simple silhouette, as fine details such as frizzy hair may not resolve properly. Similarly, partially transparent elements of the costume cause problems.<ref name=\"bermingham\" />\n\n==Background colour==\n[[File:MuseumOfScienceBoston BlueScreenAtSpecialEffectsShow.jpg|thumb|right|267px|Demonstration of the creation of visual effects techniques utilizing chroma key]]\n\n[[Blue]] was originally used for TV chroma keying [[special effects]] because the film industry used blue backgrounds for similar purposes. The colour blue was tied to the blue emulsion layer of film having comparable grain and detail in comparison to the red and [[green]] layers of the emulsion. In television and digital filmmaking, however, green has become the favoured colour because of some practical considerations, and because [[lossy compression]] algorithms used in both analog and digital TV distribution retain more detail in the green channel. The choice of colour is up to the effects artists and the needs of the specific shot. Whereas the blue screen was introduced to the television industry by the film industry, the use of green screen visual effects has been introduced to the film industry as electronic imaging has augmented and replaced the use of chemical film stock in cinema. Also, the green background is favoured over blue for outdoor filming where the blue sky might appear in the frame and could accidentally be replaced in the process. Although green and blue are the most common in part because red, green and blue components are used to encode the visible light spectrum, any key colour can be used. Red is avoided for human subjects due to its prevalence in white skin tones, but can be often used for objects and scenes which do not involve people.\n\nA so-called \"[[Sodium vapor process|yellow screen]]\" is accomplished with a white backdrop. Ordinary stage lighting is used in combination with a bright yellow sodium lamp. The sodium light falls almost entirely in a narrow frequency band, which can then be separated from the other light using a prism, and projected onto a separate but synchronized film carrier within the camera.

First the background is captured without actors or other foreground elements; then the scene is recorded. The image of the background is used to cancel the background in the actual footage; for example in a digital image, each pixel will have a different chroma key. This is sometimes referred to as a ''difference matte''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Steve Wright|title=Digital Compositing for Film and Video: Production Workflows and Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/?id=n-xHDwAAQBAJ&pg=SA2-PA23&lpg=SA2-PA23&vq=%22difference+matte%22&dq=Steve+Wright.+Digital+Compositing+for+Film+and+Video#v=onepage&q=%22difference%20matte%22&f=false|date=22 November 2017|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-315-28399-9|page=27}}</ref> However, this makes it easy for objects to be accidentally removed if they happen to be similar to the background, or for the background to remain due to camera noise or if it happens to change slightly from the reference footage.<ref>{{cite book|author=Steve Wright|title=Digital Compositing for Film and Video: Production Workflows and Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/?id=n-xHDwAAQBAJ&pg=SA2-PA25&lpg=SA2-PA25&vq=%22difference+matte%22&dq=Steve+Wright.+Digital+Compositing+for+Film+and+Video#v=onepage&q=%22difference%20matte%22&f=false|date=22 November 2017|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-315-28399-9|page=29}}</ref> A background with a repeating pattern alleviates many of these issues, and can be less sensitive to wardrobe colour than solid-colour backdrops.<ref>{{cite journal | title= Every colour chromakey | first1= Atsushi | last1=Yamashita | first2=Hiroki | last2=Agata | first3=Toru | last3=Kaneko | doi = 10.1109/ICPR.2008.4761643 | journal=Icpr 2008 | pages= 1\u20134 | year=2008| isbn= 978-1-4244-2174-9 }}</ref>\n\n==Tolerances==\n\n===Even lighting===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2019}}\n[[File:Myx tv.jpg|thumb|right|267px|A live broadcast of [[Myx TV]] using green-screen chroma key. Note the lack of shadows on the screen. The whiter area near the center of the image is due to the angle this photo was taken from, and would not appear from the video camera's angle.]]\n\nThe biggest challenge when setting up a bluescreen or greenscreen is even lighting and the avoidance of [[shadow]], because it is best to have as narrow a colour range as possible being replaced. A shadow would present itself as a darker colour to the camera and might not register for replacement. This can sometimes be seen in low-budget or live broadcasts where the errors cannot be manually repaired. The material being used affects the quality and ease of having it evenly lit. Materials which are shiny will be far less successful than those that are not. A shiny surface will have areas that reflect the lights making them appear pale, while other areas may be darkened. A matte surface will diffuse the reflected light and have a more even colour range. In order to get the cleanest key from shooting greenscreen it is necessary to create a value difference between the subject and the greenscreen. In order to differentiate the subject from the screen, a two-stop difference can be used, either by making the greenscreen two stops higher than the subject, or vice versa.\n\nSometimes a shadow can be used to create a visual effect.  Areas of the bluescreen or greenscreen with a shadow on them can be replaced with a darker version of the desired background video image, making it look like the person is casting a shadow on them. Any spill of the chroma key colour will make the result look unnatural. A difference in the [[focal length]] of the lenses used can affect the success of chroma key.\n\n===Exposure===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}Another challenge for bluescreen or greenscreen is proper [[camera exposure]]. Underexposing or overexposing a coloured backdrop can lead to poor [[Colorfulness|saturation]] levels. In the case of video cameras, underexposed images can contain high amounts of [[image noise|noise]], as well. The background must be bright enough to allow the camera to create a bright and saturated image.\n\n==Programming==\nThere are several different quality- and speed-optimised techniques for implementing colour keying in software.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cs.utah.edu/~michael/chroma/ | title = High Quality Chroma Key | last=Ashihkmin |first=Michael|publisher = University of Utah}}</ref><ref name=\"gcfilms\">{{cite web | url = http://gc-films.com/chromakey.html | title=Greenscreen code and hints | first=Edward | last=Cannon}}</ref>\n\nIn most versions, a function ''f''(''r'', ''g'', ''b'') \u2192 ''\u03b1'' is applied to every pixel in the image. \u03b1&nbsp;(alpha) has a meaning similar to that in [[alpha compositing]] techniques. ''\u03b1''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;0 means the pixel is fully in the green screen, ''\u03b1''&nbsp;\u2265&nbsp;1 means the pixel is fully in the foreground object, and intermediate values indicate the pixel is partially covered by the foreground object (or it is transparent). A further function ''g''(''r'',&nbsp;''g'',&nbsp;''b'')&nbsp;\u2192 (''r'',&nbsp;''g'',&nbsp;''b'') is needed to remove green spill on the foreground objects.\n\nA very simple ''f''() function for green screen is ''A''(''r''+''b'') \u2212 ''Bg'' where ''A'' and ''B'' are user adjustable constants with a default value of 1.0. A very simple ''g''() is (''r'', min(''g'',''b''), ''b''). This is fairly close to the capabilities of analog and film-based screen pulling.\n\nModern examples<ref name=\"gcfilms\" /> of these functions are best described by two closed nested surfaces in  3-D rgb space, often quite complex. Colours inside the inner surface are considered green screen. Colours outside the outer surface are opaque foreground. Colours between the surfaces are partially covered, they are more opaque the closer they are to the outer surface. Sometimes more closed surfaces are used to determine how to remove green spill. It is also very common for ''f''() to depend on more than just the current pixel's colour, it may also use the (''x'',&nbsp;''y'') position, the values of nearby pixels, the value from reference images or a statistical colour model of the scene,<ref>{{cite journal | title=Interactive High-Quality Green-Screen Keying via Colour Unmixing | first1=Yagiz | last1=Aksoy | first2=Tunc| last2=Aydin | first3=Marc| last3=Pollefeys | first4=Aljoscha | last4=Smolic | journal=ACM Transactions on Graphics  | volume=36 | issue=4 | pages=1 | year=2016| doi=10.1145/3072959.2907940 | doi-access=free }}</ref> and values from user-drawn masks. These produce closed surfaces in space with more than three dimensions.\n\nA different class of algorithm tries to figure out a 2D path that separates the foreground from the background. This path can be the output, or the image can be drawn by filling the path with ''\u03b1''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 as a final step. An example of such an algorithm is the use of [[active contour]].

The technique has been used in many fields to remove a [[wikt:background|background]] from the subject of a photo or video \u2013 particularly the [[news]]casting, [[motion picture]], and [[video game]] industries. A colour range in the foreground footage is made transparent, allowing separately filmed background footage or a static image to be inserted into the scene. The chroma keying technique is commonly used in [[video production]] and post-production. This technique is also referred to as '''colour keying''', '''colour-separation overlay''' ('''CSO'''; primarily by the [[BBC]]<ref name=\"What is Chroma Key?\">{{cite web |url=http://lumeo.com.au/chroma-key/ |title=What is Chroma Key?|publisher=Lumeo |access-date=3 July 2014}}</ref>), or by various terms for specific colour-related variants such as '''green screen''', '''blue screen''' and '''magic pink'''; chroma keying can be done with backgrounds of any colour that are uniform and distinct, but green and blue backgrounds are more commonly used because they differ most distinctly in hue from [[human skin colour]]s. No part of the subject being filmed or photographed may duplicate the colour used as the backing, otherwise, the part may be erroneously identified as part of the backing.<ref name=\"BorisFX\" />\n\nIt is commonly used for [[weather forecasting|weather forecast]] [[broadcast]]s, wherein a [[news presenter]] is usually seen standing in front of a large [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] map during live television [[newscast]]s, though in actuality it is a large blue or green background. When using a blue screen, different weather maps are added on the parts of the image where the colour is blue. If the news presenter wears blue clothes, his or her clothes will also be replaced with the background video. Chroma keying is also common in the entertainment industry for visual effects in [[movies]] and video games. [[Rotoscopy]] may instead be carried out on subjects that aren't in front of a green (or blue) screen. [[Motion tracking]] can also be used in conjunction with chroma keying, for example to move the background as the subject moves.\n\n==History==\n\n===Predecessors===\n\nPrior to the introduction of [[Matte (filmmaking)|travelling mattes]] and [[optical printer|optical printing]], [[double exposure]] was used to introduce elements into a scene which were not present in the initial exposure. This was done using black draping where a green screen would be used today. [[George Albert Smith (film pioneer)|George Albert Smith]] first used this approach in 1898. In 1903, ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' by [[Edwin Stanton Porter|Edwin S. Porter]] used double exposure to add background scenes to windows which were black when filmed on set, using a [[garbage matte]] to expose only the window areas.<ref>{{cite book | title=Experimental Filmmaking: Break the Machine | author=Kathryn Ramey | page=70 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XYRICgAAQBAJ&pg=PA70| isbn=9781136071508 | date=2015-07-30 }}</ref>\n\nIn order to have figures in one exposure actually move in front of a substituted background in the other, a travelling matte was needed, to occlude the correct portion of the background in each frame. In 1918 [[Frank D. Williams (cinematographer)|Frank Williams]] patented a travelling matte technique, again based on using a black background. This was used in many films, such as ''[[The Invisible Man (1933 film)|The Invisible Man]]''.<ref name=Foster />{{rp|4}}\n\nIn the 1920s, [[Walt Disney]] used a white backdrop to include human actors with cartoon characters and backgrounds in his ''[[Alice Comedies]]''.<ref name=Foster />{{rp|5}}\n\n===Bluescreen===\nThe blue screen method was developed in the 1930s at [[RKO Radio Pictures]].  At RKO, [[Linwood Dunn]] used an early version of the [[Matte (filmmaking)|travelling matte]] to create \"wipes\" \u2013 where there were transitions like a windshield wiper in films such as ''[[Flying Down to Rio]]'' (1933). Credited to [[Lawrence W. Butler|Larry Butler]], a scene featuring a genie escaping from a bottle was the first use of a proper bluescreen process to create a traveling matte for ''[[The Thief of Bagdad (1940 film)|The Thief of Bagdad]]'' (1940), which won the [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Academy Award for Best Special Effects]] that year. In 1950, [[Warner Brothers]] employee and ex-[[Kodak]] researcher [[Arthur Widmer]] began working on an [[ultraviolet]] travelling matte process. He also began developing bluescreen techniques: one of the first films to use them was the [[The Old Man and the Sea (1958 film)|1958 adaptation]] of the [[Ernest Hemingway]] novella, ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'', starring [[Spencer Tracy]].<ref name=\"cri\">{{cite web|url=http://en.chinabroadcast.cn/2246/2005-2-14/90@206385.htm|title=Illusions Take Home First Oscars|date=14 February 2005|publisher=[[China Radio International|CRI English]]|accessdate=21 January 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050315004609/http://en.chinabroadcast.cn/2246/2005-2-14/90%40206385.htm|archivedate=15 March 2005|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[Petro Vlahos]] was awarded an Academy Award for his refinement of these techniques in 1964. His technique exploits the fact that most objects in real-world scenes have a colour whose blue-colour component is similar in intensity to their green-colour component. [[Zbigniew Rybczy\u0144ski]] also contributed to bluescreen technology. An [[optical printer]] with two projectors, a film camera and a 'beam splitter', was used to combine the actor in front of a blue screen together with the background footage, one frame at a time. In the early 1970s, American and British television networks began using green backdrops instead of blue for their newscasts. During the 1980s, [[minicomputer]]s were used to control the optical printer. For the film ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', [[Richard Edlund]] created a 'quad optical printer' that accelerated the process considerably and saved money. He received a special [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for his innovation.\n\nFor decades, travelling matte shots had to be done \"locked-down\", so that neither the matted subject nor the background could shift their camera perspective at all.  Later, computer-timed, [[Motion control photography|motion-control]] cameras alleviated this problem, as both the foreground and background could be filmed with the same camera moves.\n\nMeteorologists on television often use a field monitor, to the side of the screen, to see where they are putting their hands against the background images. A newer technique is to project a faint image onto the screen.\n\nSome films make heavy use of chroma key to add backgrounds that are constructed entirely using [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI). Performances from different takes can be composited together, which allows actors to be filmed separately and then placed together in the same scene. Chroma key allows performers to appear to be in any location without leaving the studio. \nComputer development also made it easier to [[camera tracking|incorporate motion]] into composited shots, even when using handheld cameras. Reference-points can be placed onto the coloured background (usually as a painted grid, X's marked with tape, or equally spaced tennis balls attached to the wall).  In post-production, a computer can use the references to compute the camera's position and thus render an image that matches the perspective and movement of the foreground perfectly.  Modern advances in software and computational power have eliminated the need to accurately place the markers \u2013 the software figures out their position in space (a disadvantage of this is that it requires a large camera movement, possibly encouraging modern film techniques where the camera is always in motion).\n\n==Process==\n[[File:SpiderwickChroniclesSet.jpg|thumb|right|267px|Film set for ''[[The Spiderwick Chronicles (film)|The Spiderwick Chronicles]]'', where a visual effects scene using bluescreen chroma key is in preparation]]\n\nThe principal subject is filmed or photographed against a background consisting of a single colour or a relatively narrow range of colours, usually blue or green because these colours are considered to be the furthest away from skin tone.<ref name=\"BorisFX\">{{cite web|url=http://www.borisfx.com/tutorials/chroma_key.php|title=The Chroma Effect|work=Chroma Key Tutorial|publisher=BorisFX|quote=If the foreground is a person then blue or green backing colour is recommended as these colours are not present in human flesh pigments.

This process is commonly known as \"[[keying (graphics)|keying]]\", \"keying out\" or simply a \"key\".\n\n===Processing a green backdrop===\n[[File:VirtuellesStudio Greenbox.jpg|thumb|right|267px|Virtual television studio with green-screen technique. The high amount of contrast between different parts of the screen is not ideal (see [[Chroma key#Even lighting|even lighting]]). Green reflections from the desk would create undesirable artifacts.]]\n\nGreen is used as a backdrop for TV and electronic cinematography more than any other colour because television weathermen tended to wear blue suits. When chroma keying first came into use in television production, the blue screen that was then the norm in the movie industry was used out of habit, until other practical considerations caused the television industry to move from blue to green screens. Broadcast quality colour television cameras use separate red, green and blue image sensors, and early analog TV chroma keyers required RGB component video to work reliably. From a technological perspective it was equally possible to use the blue or green channel, but because blue clothing was an ongoing challenge, the green screen came into common use. Newscasters sometimes forget the chroma key dress code, and when the key is applied to clothing of the same colour as the background, the person would seem to disappear into the key. Because green clothing is less common than blue, it soon became apparent that it was easier to use a green matte screen than it was to constantly police the clothing choices of on-air talent.   Also, because the human eye is more sensitive to green wavelengths, which lie in the middle of the visible light spectrum, the green analog video channel typically carried more signal strength, giving a better signal to noise ratio compared to the other component video channels, so green screen keys could produce the cleanest key. In the digital television and cinema age, much of the tweaking that was required to make a good quality key has been automated. However, the one constant that remains is some level of colour coordination to keep foreground subjects from being keyed out.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.videomaker.com/article/f5/13055-the-keys-to-chromakey-how-to-use-a-green-screen |title=The Keys To Chromakey: How To Use A Green Screen|publisher=Videomaker |accessdate=23 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Processing a blue backdrop===\nBefore electronic chroma keying, compositing was done on (chemical) film. The camera colour negative was printed onto high-contrast black and white negative, using either a filter or the high contrast film's colour sensitivity to expose only blue (and higher) frequencies. Blue light only shines through the colour negative where there is ''not'' blue in the scene, so this left the film clear where the blue screen was, and opaque elsewhere, except it also produced clear for any white objects (since they also contained blue). Removing these spots could be done by a suitable double-exposure with the colour positive (thus turning any area containing red or green opaque), and many other techniques. The end result was film that was clear where the blue screen was, and opaque everywhere else. This is called a ''female matte'', similar to an ''[[alpha matte]]'' in digital keying. Copying this film onto another high-contrast negative produced the opposite ''male matte''. The background negative was then packed with the female matte and exposed onto a final strip of film, then the camera negative was packed with the male matte was double-printed onto this same film. These two images combined together creates the final effect.\n\n===Major factors===\nThe most important factor for a key is the colour separation of the foreground (the subject) and background (the screen)&nbsp;\u2013 a blue screen will be used if the subject is predominantly green (for example plants), despite the camera being more sensitive to green light.\n\nIn [[Analog television|analog color TV]], colour is represented by the phase of the chroma [[Subcarrier#Television|subcarrier]] relative to a reference oscillator. Chroma key is achieved by comparing the phase of the video to the phase corresponding to the pre-selected colour. In-phase portions of the video are replaced by the alternate background video.\n\nIn [[Digital television|digital color TV]], colour is represented by three numbers (red, green, blue intensity levels). Chroma key is achieved by a simple numerical comparison between the video and the pre-selected colour. If the colour at a particular point on the screen matches (either exactly, or in a range), then the video at that point is replaced by the alternate background.\n\n====Lighting====\nIn order to create an illusion that characters and objects filmed are present in the intended background scene, the lighting in the two scenes must be a reasonable match. For outdoor scenes, overcast days create a diffuse, evenly coloured light which can be easier to match in the studio, whereas direct sunlight needs to be matched in both direction and overall colour based on time of day.\n\nA studio shot taken in front of a green screen will naturally have ambient light the same colour as the screen, due to its light scattering. This effect is known as ''spill''.<ref name=Foster />{{rp|p20}} This can look unnatural or cause portions of the characters to disappear, so must be compensated for, or avoided by using a larger screen placed far from the actors.<ref>{{Cite book |last1= Aronson |first1= David |authorlink1= David Aronson |title= DV Filmmaking: From Start to Finish, Volume 1 |year= 2006 |publisher= O'Reilly Media, Inc. |isbn= 978-0596008482 |pages= [https://archive.org/details/dvfilmmakingfrom0000aron/page/52 52\u201353] |url= https://archive.org/details/dvfilmmakingfrom0000aron/page/52 }}</ref>\n\n====Camera====\nThe depth of field used to record the scene in front of the coloured screen should match that of the background.

An example of intentional use of this is when an actor wears a blue covering over a part of his body to make it invisible in the final shot. This technique can be used to achieve an effect similar to that used in the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' films to create the effect of an [[Cloak of invisibility|invisibility cloak]]. The actor can also be filmed against a chroma-key background and inserted into the background shot with a distortion effect, in order to create a cloak that is marginally detectable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.creativecow.net/articles/stern_eran/Invisible_Cape.php |title=Creating an invisible cape in After Effects |publisher=Library.creativecow.net |accessdate=20 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nDifficulties emerge with blue screen when a costume in an effects shot must be blue, such as [[Superman]]'s traditional blue outfit.  In the 2002 film ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'', in scenes where both [[Spider-Man]] and the [[Green Goblin]] are in the air, Spider-Man had to be shot in front of the green screen and the Green Goblin had to be shot in front of a blue screen. The colour difference is because Spider-Man wears a costume which is red and blue in colour and the Green Goblin wears a costume which is entirely green in colour. If both were shot in front of the same screen, parts of one character would be erased from the shot.\n\nFor a clean division of foreground from background, it is also important that clothing and hair in the foreground shot have a fairly simple silhouette, as fine details such as frizzy hair may not resolve properly. Similarly, partially transparent elements of the costume cause problems.<ref name=\"bermingham\" />\n\n==Background colour==\n[[File:MuseumOfScienceBoston BlueScreenAtSpecialEffectsShow.jpg|thumb|right|267px|Demonstration of the creation of visual effects techniques utilizing chroma key]]\n\n[[Blue]] was originally used for TV chroma keying [[special effects]] because the film industry used blue backgrounds for similar purposes. The colour blue was tied to the blue emulsion layer of film having comparable grain and detail in comparison to the red and [[green]] layers of the emulsion. In television and digital filmmaking, however, green has become the favoured colour because of some practical considerations, and because [[lossy compression]] algorithms used in both analog and digital TV distribution retain more detail in the green channel. The choice of colour is up to the effects artists and the needs of the specific shot. Whereas the blue screen was introduced to the television industry by the film industry, the use of green screen visual effects has been introduced to the film industry as electronic imaging has augmented and replaced the use of chemical film stock in cinema. Also, the green background is favoured over blue for outdoor filming where the blue sky might appear in the frame and could accidentally be replaced in the process. Although green and blue are the most common in part because red, green and blue components are used to encode the visible light spectrum, any key colour can be used. Red is avoided for human subjects due to its prevalence in white skin tones, but can be often used for objects and scenes which do not involve people.\n\nA so-called \"[[Sodium vapor process|yellow screen]]\" is accomplished with a white backdrop. Ordinary stage lighting is used in combination with a bright yellow sodium lamp. The sodium light falls almost entirely in a narrow frequency band, which can then be separated from the other light using a prism, and projected onto a separate but synchronized film carrier within the camera. This second film is high-contrast black and white, and is processed to produce the matte.<ref name=Foster>{{cite book | title=The Green Screen Handbook: Real-World Production Techniques | first=Jeff | last=Foster | publisher=John Wiley & Sons | year=2010 | isbn=978-0-470-52107-6}}</ref>{{rp|16}}\n\nOccasionally, a [[magenta]] background is used, as in some software applications where the magenta or [[fuchsia (color)|fuchsia]] is sometimes referred to as \"magic pink\".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.skinyourscreen.com/site/Articles/so-you-wanna-make-a-theme | title = So you wanna make a theme? | work = skinyourscreen.com articles | accessdate = 23 August 2008 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071029042547/http://www.skinyourscreen.com/site/Articles/so-you-wanna-make-a-theme | archivedate = 29 October 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nA newer technique is to use a [[retroreflective]] curtain in the background, along with a ring of bright [[LED]]s around the [[camera lens]].  This requires no light to shine on the background other than the LEDs, which use an extremely small amount of power and space unlike big [[stage light]]s, and require no [[rigging (theatre)|rigging]].  This advance was made possible by the invention in the 1990s of practical blue LEDs, which also allow for [[Emerald (color)|emerald green]] LEDs.\n\nThere is also a form of colour keying that uses light spectrum invisible to human eye. Called Thermo-Key, it uses [[infrared]] as the key colour, which would not be replaced by background image during [[Video post-processing|postprocessing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hc.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/project/thermo-key/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221094257/http://www.hc.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/project/thermo-key|archive-date=21 February 2009|title=What is Thermo-Key?|publisher=[[University of Tokyo]]|accessdate=21 January 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Thermo-key: human region segmentation from video|journal=IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications|year=2004|volume=24|issue=1|pages=26\u201330|pmid=15384664|doi=10.1109/MCG.2004.1255805 |last1=Yasuda|first1=K. |last2=Naemura|first2=T. |last3=Harashima|first3=H. }}</ref>\n\nFor ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', an [[ultraviolet light]] matting process was proposed by Don Lee of CIS Hollywood and developed by [[Gary Hutzel]] and the staff of [[Image G]].

First the background is captured without actors or other foreground elements; then the scene is recorded. The image of the background is used to cancel the background in the actual footage; for example in a digital image, each pixel will have a different chroma key. This is sometimes referred to as a ''difference matte''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Steve Wright|title=Digital Compositing for Film and Video: Production Workflows and Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/?id=n-xHDwAAQBAJ&pg=SA2-PA23&lpg=SA2-PA23&vq=%22difference+matte%22&dq=Steve+Wright.+Digital+Compositing+for+Film+and+Video#v=onepage&q=%22difference%20matte%22&f=false|date=22 November 2017|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-315-28399-9|page=27}}</ref> However, this makes it easy for objects to be accidentally removed if they happen to be similar to the background, or for the background to remain due to camera noise or if it happens to change slightly from the reference footage.<ref>{{cite book|author=Steve Wright|title=Digital Compositing for Film and Video: Production Workflows and Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/?id=n-xHDwAAQBAJ&pg=SA2-PA25&lpg=SA2-PA25&vq=%22difference+matte%22&dq=Steve+Wright.+Digital+Compositing+for+Film+and+Video#v=onepage&q=%22difference%20matte%22&f=false|date=22 November 2017|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-315-28399-9|page=29}}</ref> A background with a repeating pattern alleviates many of these issues, and can be less sensitive to wardrobe colour than solid-colour backdrops.<ref>{{cite journal | title= Every colour chromakey | first1= Atsushi | last1=Yamashita | first2=Hiroki | last2=Agata | first3=Toru | last3=Kaneko | doi = 10.1109/ICPR.2008.4761643 | journal=Icpr 2008 | pages= 1\u20134 | year=2008| isbn= 978-1-4244-2174-9 }}</ref>\n\n==Tolerances==\n\n===Even lighting===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2019}}\n[[File:Myx tv.jpg|thumb|right|267px|A live broadcast of [[Myx TV]] using green-screen chroma key. Note the lack of shadows on the screen. The whiter area near the center of the image is due to the angle this photo was taken from, and would not appear from the video camera's angle.]]\n\nThe biggest challenge when setting up a bluescreen or greenscreen is even lighting and the avoidance of [[shadow]], because it is best to have as narrow a colour range as possible being replaced. A shadow would present itself as a darker colour to the camera and might not register for replacement. This can sometimes be seen in low-budget or live broadcasts where the errors cannot be manually repaired. The material being used affects the quality and ease of having it evenly lit. Materials which are shiny will be far less successful than those that are not. A shiny surface will have areas that reflect the lights making them appear pale, while other areas may be darkened. A matte surface will diffuse the reflected light and have a more even colour range. In order to get the cleanest key from shooting greenscreen it is necessary to create a value difference between the subject and the greenscreen. In order to differentiate the subject from the screen, a two-stop difference can be used, either by making the greenscreen two stops higher than the subject, or vice versa.\n\nSometimes a shadow can be used to create a visual effect.  Areas of the bluescreen or greenscreen with a shadow on them can be replaced with a darker version of the desired background video image, making it look like the person is casting a shadow on them. Any spill of the chroma key colour will make the result look unnatural. A difference in the [[focal length]] of the lenses used can affect the success of chroma key.\n\n===Exposure===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}Another challenge for bluescreen or greenscreen is proper [[camera exposure]]. Underexposing or overexposing a coloured backdrop can lead to poor [[Colorfulness|saturation]] levels. In the case of video cameras, underexposed images can contain high amounts of [[image noise|noise]], as well. The background must be bright enough to allow the camera to create a bright and saturated image.\n\n==Programming==\nThere are several different quality- and speed-optimised techniques for implementing colour keying in software.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cs.utah.edu/~michael/chroma/ | title = High Quality Chroma Key | last=Ashihkmin |first=Michael|publisher = University of Utah}}</ref><ref name=\"gcfilms\">{{cite web | url = http://gc-films.com/chromakey.html | title=Greenscreen code and hints | first=Edward | last=Cannon}}</ref>\n\nIn most versions, a function ''f''(''r'', ''g'', ''b'') \u2192 ''\u03b1'' is applied to every pixel in the image. \u03b1&nbsp;(alpha) has a meaning similar to that in [[alpha compositing]] techniques. ''\u03b1''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;0 means the pixel is fully in the green screen, ''\u03b1''&nbsp;\u2265&nbsp;1 means the pixel is fully in the foreground object, and intermediate values indicate the pixel is partially covered by the foreground object (or it is transparent). A further function ''g''(''r'',&nbsp;''g'',&nbsp;''b'')&nbsp;\u2192 (''r'',&nbsp;''g'',&nbsp;''b'') is needed to remove green spill on the foreground objects.\n\nA very simple ''f''() function for green screen is ''A''(''r''+''b'') \u2212 ''Bg'' where ''A'' and ''B'' are user adjustable constants with a default value of 1.0. A very simple ''g''() is (''r'', min(''g'',''b''), ''b''). This is fairly close to the capabilities of analog and film-based screen pulling.\n\nModern examples<ref name=\"gcfilms\" /> of these functions are best described by two closed nested surfaces in  3-D rgb space, often quite complex. Colours inside the inner surface are considered green screen. Colours outside the outer surface are opaque foreground. Colours between the surfaces are partially covered, they are more opaque the closer they are to the outer surface. Sometimes more closed surfaces are used to determine how to remove green spill. It is also very common for ''f''() to depend on more than just the current pixel's colour, it may also use the (''x'',&nbsp;''y'') position, the values of nearby pixels, the value from reference images or a statistical colour model of the scene,<ref>{{cite journal | title=Interactive High-Quality Green-Screen Keying via Colour Unmixing | first1=Yagiz | last1=Aksoy | first2=Tunc| last2=Aydin | first3=Marc| last3=Pollefeys | first4=Aljoscha | last4=Smolic | journal=ACM Transactions on Graphics  | volume=36 | issue=4 | pages=1 | year=2016| doi=10.1145/3072959.2907940 | doi-access=free }}</ref> and values from user-drawn masks. These produce closed surfaces in space with more than three dimensions.\n\nA different class of algorithm tries to figure out a 2D path that separates the foreground from the background. This path can be the output, or the image can be drawn by filling the path with ''\u03b1''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 as a final step. An example of such an algorithm is the use of [[active contour]].

Their first project of this kind, ''Company'' (1970), was a solid success and paved the way for other innovative musicals.\"<ref>[https://masterworksbroadway.com/artist/harold-prince/ \"Harold Prince\"] masterworksbroadway.com, accessed August 2, 2019</ref>\n\nThe Harold Prince Theatre at the [[Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania|Annenberg Center]] of the University of Pennsylvania is named in his honor.<ref>[https://annenbergcenter.org/rentals/theatres.php \"Theatres & Rehearsal Rooms, Annenberg Center\"] Annenberg Center.org, accessed July 31, 2019</ref>\n\nA documentary titled ''Harold Prince: The Director\u2019s Life'' was directed by [[Lonny Price]] and broadcast on [[PBS]] ''Great Performances'' in November 2018.<ref>Hetrick, Adam.
