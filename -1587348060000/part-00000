In the subsequent siege of the Weaver residence, led by the FBI, Weaver's 43-year-old wife Vicki was killed by FBI sniper fire. All casualties occurred on the first two days of the operation. The siege and stand-off were ultimately resolved by civilian negotiators, with the surrender and arrest of Kevin Harris on August 30, and the surrender of Randy Weaver and the surviving Weaver children the next day.\n\nWeaver and Harris were subsequently arraigned on a variety of federal criminal charges, including first-degree murder for the death of Degan. Harris was acquitted of all charges, and Weaver was subsequently acquitted of all charges except for the original bail condition violation for the arms charges and for having missed his original court date.

At the completion of the trial, the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice's]] [[Office of Professional Responsibility]] formed the Ruby Ridge Task Force (RRTF) to investigate Spence's charges.

The evolution of that profile was later criticized in a 1995 report by a subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee:\n\n<blockquote>The Subcommittee is ... concerned that, as Marshals investigating the Weaver case learned facts that contradicted information they previously had been provided, they did not adequately integrate their updated knowledge into their overall assessment of who Randy Weaver was or what threat he might pose. If the Marshals made any attempt to assess the credibility of the various people who gave them information about Weaver, they never recorded their assessments. Thus, rather than maintaining the Threat Source Profile as a [[living document]], the Marshals added new reports to an ever-expanding file, and their overall assessment never really changed. These problems rendered it difficult for other law enforcement officials to assess the Weaver case accurately without the benefit of first-hand briefings from persons who had continuing involvement with him.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Company|first1=Diane Publishing|title=Ruby Ridge: Report of the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology and Government Information of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UOy-7sG5CVEC&pg=PA34&lpg=PA34&dq=as+Marshals+investigating+the+Weaver+case+learned#v=onepage&q=as%20Marshals%20investigating%20the%20Weaver%20case%20learned&f=false|publisher=Diane Publishing|accessdate=July 22, 2017|year=1996|isbn=978-0788129766}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nMany of the people used by the marshals as third party go-betweens on the Weaver case\u2014Bill and Judy Grider, Alan Jeppeson, [[Richard Butler (white supremacist)|Richard Butler]]\u2014were evaluated by the marshals as more radical than the Weavers themselves.

Whenever feasible, verbal warnings should be given before deadly force is applied.}}\n\nThis was in stark contrast to the permissive ROE adopted for the Ruby Ridge stand-off.<ref name=\"permissive\">{{cite web|last1=Lardner Jr|first1=George|last2=Lei|first2=Richard|title=Permissive Rules of Engagement' at Issue in Ruby Ridge Shooting|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1995/07/14/permissive-rules-of-engagement-at-issue-in-ruby-ridge-shooting/41005d73-b0cd-4104-ac25-e6b02d27e734/|website=The Washington Post|accessdate=July 23, 2017|date=July 14, 1995}}</ref><ref name=WalterEveryKnee98>{{ cite book|author=Walter, Jess|year=1996|orig-year=1995|title=Every Knee Shall Bow: The Truth and Tragedy of Ruby Ridge and the Randy Weaver Family|page=[https://archive.org/details/everykneeshallbo00walt/page/190 190]|location=New York|publisher=HarperPaperbacks|isbn=0-06-101131-2|url=https://archive.org/details/everykneeshallbo00walt|url-access=registration|access-date=February 7, 2017}} The link to this title is to the 1996 edition.</ref>\n\n===Deployment of sniper/observers, ROE understanding===\nOn August 22, the second day of the siege, between 2:30\u2013\u20603:30 pm, the FBI HRT sniper/observer teams were briefed and deployed to the cabin on foot.<ref name=\"p520\"/> According to the RRTF report to the [[United States Department of Justice|DOJ]], there were various views and interpretations taken of these ROEs by members of FBI SWAT teams in action at the Ruby Ridge site, including describing them as \"severe\" and \"inappropriate\" (Denver SWAT team leader Gregory Sexton), and as \"strong\" and a \"departure from the ... standard deadly force policy\", as \"inappropriate\", and of a sort he \"had never been given\" before (two members of the Denver SWAT team). The latter of these two members stated further that \"other SWAT team members were taken aback by the Rules and that most of them clung to the FBI's standard deadly force policy,\" and a further team member responded to the briefing on the ROE with \"[y]ou've gotta be kidding.\"<ref name=RRTF_OPR_IVF2c_fns614616>RRTF, ''Report of the RRTF to the OPR'' (1994), Ch.

Examples included HRT sniper Dale Monroe, who saw the ROE as a \"green light\" to shoot armed adult males on sight, and HRT sniper Edward Wenger who believed that if he observed armed adults, he could use deadly force, but he was to follow standard deadly force policy for all other individuals. Fred Lanceley, the FBI Hostage Negotiator at Ruby Ridge, was \"surprised and shocked\" at the ROE, the most severe rules he had ever heard in his over 300 hostage situations, and characterized the ROE as being inconsistent with standard policy.<ref name=RRTF_OPR_IVF2ag>RRTF, ''Report of the RRTF to the OPR'' (1994), Ch.

It&nbsp;began on August&nbsp;21, when [[Randy Weaver]], members of his immediate family, and family friend Kevin Harris resisted deputies of the [[United States Marshals Service]] (USMS) and the [[Hostage Rescue Team]] of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI HRT).\n\nDuring a Marshals Service reconnoiter of the Weaver property pursuant to a bench warrant for Weaver after his [[failure to appear]] on firearms charges, an initial encounter between six U.S. Marshals and the Weavers resulted in a [[shootout]] and the deaths of deputy U.S. Marshal William Francis Degan, age 42, the Weavers' son Samuel (Sammy), age 14, and the Weavers' family dog (Striker). In the subsequent siege of the Weaver residence, led by the FBI, Weaver's 43-year-old wife Vicki was killed by FBI sniper fire. All casualties occurred on the first two days of the operation. The siege and stand-off were ultimately resolved by civilian negotiators, with the surrender and arrest of Kevin Harris on August 30, and the surrender of Randy Weaver and the surviving Weaver children the next day.\n\nWeaver and Harris were subsequently arraigned on a variety of federal criminal charges, including first-degree murder for the death of Degan. Harris was acquitted of all charges, and Weaver was subsequently acquitted of all charges except for the original bail condition violation for the arms charges and for having missed his original court date. He was fined [[United States dollar|$]]10,000 and sentenced to 18 months in prison, credited with time served plus an additional three months, then released.<ref name=\"nyt18\">{{cite news|title=18 Months in Jail for White Supremacist|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/19/us/18-months-in-jail-for-supremacist.html|accessdate=July 22, 2017|work=The New York Times|date=October 19, 1993}}</ref><ref name=\"jess\">{{cite book|last1=Walter|first1=Jess|title=Ruby Ridge: The Truth and Tragedy of the Randy Weaver Family|date=2002|publisher=ReganBooks|location=New York|isbn=978-0060007942|edition=1st trade pbk.}}</ref>\n\nDuring the federal criminal trial of Weaver and Harris, Weaver's attorney [[Gerry Spence]] made accusations of \"criminal wrongdoing\" against the agencies involved in the incident, in particular, the FBI, the USMS, the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms]] (ATF), and the [[United States Attorney's Office]] (USAO) for Idaho. At the completion of the trial, the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice's]] [[Office of Professional Responsibility]] formed the Ruby Ridge Task Force (RRTF) to investigate Spence's charges. A redacted [[HTML]] version of the RRTF report was publicly released by Lexis Counsel Connect, an information service for attorneys, which raised questions about the conduct and policies of all of the participating agencies. A PDF version of the report was later posted by the Justice Department.<ref name=RRTF_OPR_GenRef>RRTF, ''Report of the RRTF to the OPR'' (1994; ''more complete version''), see Bibliography.</ref><ref name=justiceDOTgovRedacted>RRTF, ''Report of the RRTF to the OPR'' (2006) [1994; OPR legacy, highly redacted version, PDF series], see Bibliography.</ref>\n\nBoth the Weaver family and Harris brought civil suits against the government over the events of the firefight and siege, the Weavers winning a combined out-of-court settlement in August 1995 of $3.1 million, and Harris being awarded, after persistent appeals, a $380,000 settlement in September 2000.\n\nTo answer public questions about Ruby Ridge, the [[United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Terrorism and Homeland Security|Senate Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology and Government Information]] held hearings between September 6 and October 19, 1995, and subsequently issued a report calling for reforms in federal law enforcement to prevent a repeat of the losses of life at Ruby Ridge, and to restore public confidence in federal law enforcement.<ref name=\"reformstatement\">{{cite web|title=Opening Statement of Louis J.

The evolution of that profile was later criticized in a 1995 report by a subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee:\n\n<blockquote>The Subcommittee is ... concerned that, as Marshals investigating the Weaver case learned facts that contradicted information they previously had been provided, they did not adequately integrate their updated knowledge into their overall assessment of who Randy Weaver was or what threat he might pose. If the Marshals made any attempt to assess the credibility of the various people who gave them information about Weaver, they never recorded their assessments. Thus, rather than maintaining the Threat Source Profile as a [[living document]], the Marshals added new reports to an ever-expanding file, and their overall assessment never really changed. These problems rendered it difficult for other law enforcement officials to assess the Weaver case accurately without the benefit of first-hand briefings from persons who had continuing involvement with him.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Company|first1=Diane Publishing|title=Ruby Ridge: Report of the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology and Government Information of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UOy-7sG5CVEC&pg=PA34&lpg=PA34&dq=as+Marshals+investigating+the+Weaver+case+learned#v=onepage&q=as%20Marshals%20investigating%20the%20Weaver%20case%20learned&f=false|publisher=Diane Publishing|accessdate=July 22, 2017|year=1996|isbn=978-0788129766}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nMany of the people used by the marshals as third party go-betweens on the Weaver case\u2014Bill and Judy Grider, Alan Jeppeson, [[Richard Butler (white supremacist)|Richard Butler]]\u2014were evaluated by the marshals as more radical than the Weavers themselves.

Two new lit signs on the east and west ends of the arena saying \"United Center\" with the United globe in the middle were revealed below the upper level suites complementing the former \"Madhouse\" signs on the north and south sides.\n\nIn December 2013, it was announced that an agreement had been reached to keep United's naming rights for the arena for another 20 years. The United Center will see a series of updates and upgrades to the interior and exterior of the building. New signage, additional LED boards, and other elements have been added after reaching this agreement. LED screens have been installed on the north side of the arena along with a panoramic LED board on the 300 level, eliminating the \"Welcome To The Madhouse\" sign.\n\n[[Anheuser-Busch]] has also established a sponsorship.

Its largest population centres are [[Gore, New Zealand|Gore]] and [[Balclutha, New Zealand|Balclutha]]. In [[2008 New Zealand general election|2008]], the seat of [[Otago (New Zealand electorate)|Otago]] was abolished and split between the Waitaki and Clutha-Southland electorates, and parts of Central Otago, primarily around Arrowtown, [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]] and Roxburgh were also transferred to Clutha-Southland.\n\nClutha-Southland is the successor to the old [[Wallace (New Zealand electorate)|Wallace]], [[Clutha (New Zealand electorate)|Clutha]] and [[Awarua (New Zealand electorate)|Awarua]] constituencies. Its boundaries had changed at all three redistributions undertaken since its creation, as dwindling populations in both the old Clutha-Southland electorate and in the neighbouring [[Invercargill (New Zealand electorate)|Invercargill electorate]] have forced both seats northwards to ensure every electorate population stays within certain limits. This trend stopped in the 2013 redistribution, however, with both the Clutha-Southland and Invercargill electorates remaining unchanged in area,<ref>{{cite book |title=Report of the Representation Commission 2014 |url=http://www.elections.org.nz/sites/default/files/bulk-upload/documents/report_of_the_representation_commission_2014.pdf |isbn=978-0-477-10414-2 |publisher=Representation Commission |accessdate=26 September 2014 |page=10 |format=PDF |date=4 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006075102/http://www.elections.org.nz/sites/default/files/bulk-upload/documents/report_of_the_representation_commission_2014.pdf |archive-date=6 October 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and then reversed in the 2020 redistribution, with the electorate gaining a large area around [[Alexandra, New Zealand|Alexandra]] from {{NZ electorate link|Waitaki}}, but losing the [[Balclutha, New Zealand|Balclutha]] area to the new {{NZ electorate link|Taieri}} electorate and [[Tuatapere]] to Invercargill.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://vote.nz/assets/Boundary-Review/REPORT-OF-THE-REPRESENTATION-COMMISSION-2020.pdf |title=Report of the Representation Commission 2020 |date=17 April 2020}}</ref> It was renamed {{NZ electorate link|Southland}} as it no longer included the Clutha area.<!-- The link is purposeful -->\n\n==History==\nBecause of its largely rural nature, Clutha-Southland is one of the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]]'s safest seats.

Representatives]]. The current MP for Clutha Southland is [[Hamish Walker]] of the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]]. He has held the seat since the [[2017 New Zealand general election|2017 general election]].\n\n==Population centres==\nClutha-Southland was promulgated as one of the original 65 MMP electorates, centred on [[Southland District|Southland]] district and covering an area stretching from [[Fiordland]] across the far south of the [[South Island]] to the south [[Otago]] coast. Its largest population centres are [[Gore, New Zealand|Gore]] and [[Balclutha, New Zealand|Balclutha]]. In [[2008 New Zealand general election|2008]], the seat of [[Otago (New Zealand electorate)|Otago]] was abolished and split between the Waitaki and Clutha-Southland electorates, and parts of Central Otago, primarily around Arrowtown, [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]] and Roxburgh were also transferred to Clutha-Southland.\n\nClutha-Southland is the successor to the old [[Wallace (New Zealand electorate)|Wallace]], [[Clutha (New Zealand electorate)|Clutha]] and [[Awarua (New Zealand electorate)|Awarua]] constituencies. Its boundaries had changed at all three redistributions undertaken since its creation, as dwindling populations in both the old Clutha-Southland electorate and in the neighbouring [[Invercargill (New Zealand electorate)|Invercargill electorate]] have forced both seats northwards to ensure every electorate population stays within certain limits. This trend stopped in the 2013 redistribution, however, with both the Clutha-Southland and Invercargill electorates remaining unchanged in area,<ref>{{cite book |title=Report of the Representation Commission 2014 |url=http://www.elections.org.nz/sites/default/files/bulk-upload/documents/report_of_the_representation_commission_2014.pdf |isbn=978-0-477-10414-2 |publisher=Representation Commission |accessdate=26 September 2014 |page=10 |format=PDF |date=4 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006075102/http://www.elections.org.nz/sites/default/files/bulk-upload/documents/report_of_the_representation_commission_2014.pdf |archive-date=6 October 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and then reversed in the 2020 redistribution, with the electorate gaining a large area around [[Alexandra, New Zealand|Alexandra]] from {{NZ electorate link|Waitaki}}, but losing the [[Balclutha, New Zealand|Balclutha]] area to the new {{NZ electorate link|Taieri}} electorate and [[Tuatapere]] to Invercargill.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://vote.nz/assets/Boundary-Review/REPORT-OF-THE-REPRESENTATION-COMMISSION-2020.pdf |title=Report of the Representation Commission 2020 |date=17 April 2020}}</ref> It was renamed '''{{NZ electorate link|Southland}}''' as it no longer included the Clutha area.<!-- The link is purposeful -->\n\n==History==\nBecause of its largely rural nature, Clutha-Southland is one of the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]]'s safest seats.

It has been at its current location on E. Emerson Cummings Boulevard since its completion in 1980. A very small addition was made in the late 1990s which added a small hallway on the side of the gym that included several offices. It has a small enrollment of about 250 students, making it the smallest high school in southern Maine. Since the school has such a lengthy name, it is commonly abbreviated as OOBHS.\n\n==Summary: Source - https://rsu23.org/==\nThis is the summary that is provided on the school website:\n<blockquote>\n''Old Orchard Beach High School is a four-year public high school that serves approximately 250 students in grades 9\u201312 with a comprehensive academic curriculum. The school is accredited by the [[New England Association of Schools and Colleges]]. In the mid-1990s, OOB High School was granted the distinction of National School of Excellence for its outstanding commitment to enhancing student learning and performance.

A very small addition was made in the late 1990s which added a small hallway on the side of the gym that included several offices. It has a small enrollment of about 250 students, making it the smallest high school in southern Maine.

Born in [[Hertfordshire]], England, his father may have been a [[clerk]] and a [[monk]] called Robert, but his mother is unknown, and he may have been illegitimate. Although he does not appear to have received a great degree of schooling, while still a youth he travelled to France where he was schooled in [[Arles]], studying law. He then travelled to [[Avignon]], in the south, where he joined the abbey of [[St Ruf]]. There he became a [[Canons regular|canon regular]] and was eventually appointed abbot. He travelled to [[Rome]] several times, where he appears to have caught the attention of [[Pope Eugenius III]]. Eugenius sent him on a mission to [[Catalonia]], where the [[Reconquista]] was attempting to reclaim land from the Muslim [[Al-Andalus]]. Around this time his abbey complained to Eugenius that Breakspear was too heavy a [[disciplinarian]], and in order to make use of him as a [[papal legate]] as well as to pacify his monks, the Pope appointed Breakspear [[Bishop of Albano]] some time around 1149.\n\nAs Bishop, Breakspear was soon sent on another diplomatic mission, this time to [[Scandinavia]]. In the middle of [[Civil war era in Norway|a civil war]], Breakspear reorganised the church in Norway and then moved on to Sweden. Here he was very much accclamed by the people, and when he left, [[Chronicle|chroniclers]] called him a saint. Breakspear returned to Rome in 1154; the Pope had died only a few weeks previously. For reasons now unknown, but possibly at his predecessor's request, Breakspear was elected next Pope by the cardinals. He took the name Adrian IV. He was unable to complete his coronation service, however, because of the parlous state of politics in Rome, which at the time was a den of [[heresy]] and [[republicanism]]. Adrian decisively restored the papal authority there, but his other major policy issue\u2014relations with the newly-crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I\u2014]]<nowiki/>started off badly and got progressively worse. Each party, as a result of a particular aggravating incident, found something to condemn the other for. As a result, Adrian entered into an alliance with the [[Byzantine emperor]], [[Manuel I Komnenos]] who was keen to re-assert his authority in the south of Italy, but was unable to do so due to the [[Norman Kingdom of Sicily|Norman Kings]]' occupation of the region, now under [[William I of Sicily]].\n\nAdrian's alliance with the Byzantine emperor came to nothing, as William decisively defeated Manuel and forced Adrian to come to terms at the [[Treaty of Benevento]]. This alienated Emperor Frederick even more, as he saw it as a repudiation of [[Treaty of Constance (1153)|their existing treaty]]. Relations souted further when Frederick laid claim to a large swathe of territory in northern Italy. Adrian's relations with his country of birth, however, seem to have remained generally good. Certainly he showered [[St Albans Abbey]] with privileges, and he appears to have forwarded [[Henry II of England|King Henry II's]] policies where he could. Most famously, in 1158 Adrian is supposed to have granted Henry the [[papal bull]] ''[[Laudabiliter]]'', which is thought to have authorised Henry to invade Ireland. Henry did not do so, however, for another 14 years, and scholars are uncertain whether the bull ever existed.\n\nFollowing Adrian's death at [[Anagni]], there was uncertainty as to who to succeed him, with both pro- and anti-imperial cardinals voting for different candidates. Although officially [[Pope Alexander III]] officially took over, the concomitant election of an [[Antipope]] led to a 22-year-long schism. Scholars have debated Adrian's pontificate widely. Much of a positive nature\u2014his building program and reorganisation of papal finances, for example\u2014has been identified, particularly in the context of such a short reign. He was also up against powerful forces out of his control, which, while he never overcame them, he managed effectively.\n\n==Early life==\nThe son of Richard Breakspear,{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} his family was a relatively humble one.{{sfn|Summerson|2004}} The exact year of his birth is unknown but he was probably around 55 years old on his election.{{sfn|Norwich|2011}} Little is known{{refn|The only reliable source closest to his own life is that by Cardinal Boso in the ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'', but, comments Brooke, \"this is exceedingly terse on his early life\", noting only his nationality and voyage to France for learning.{{sfn|Brooke|2003|p=4}}|group=note}} of his background, and that which is, comments Brooke, \"savour[s] of gossip rather than sober history.{{sfn|Brooke|2003|p=4}} He was probably born in or around the Hertfordshire town of [[St Albans]]. As a result, much of that that is thought to be known may well be mythological \"tradition woven at the great abbey\" there.{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} Much of what is known is brought to historians by the writings of [[Boso (Cardinal)|Cardinal Boso]] and [[William of Newburgh]], both of whom were, however, writing over 30 years after Breakspear's death.{{sfn|Poole|1969|p=291}} As a result, notes Poole, there is a dearth of information\u2014and especially dates\u2014for Breakspear's life until his election as Pope, and \"all that can be said is that the dates commonly given are in every instance wrong\".{{sfn|Poole|1969|p=293}} The contemporary English [[chronicle]]r [[Matthew Paris]] says he came from [[Abbots Langley]],{{sfn|Maxwell-Stuart|1997|p=97}} although Paris mistakenly ascribes to his father the name [[Robert de Camera]].{{sfn|Brooke|2003|p=5}} Robert may have been a clerk{{sfn|Maxwell-Stuart|1997|p=97}}{{refn|Christopher Brooke also surmises that, with a surname such as \"Camera\", he was likely to have been a clerk.{{sfn|Brooke|2003|p=6}}|group=note}} although Sayers suggests that Paris' claim that Robert was a priest is probably correct, as is the likelihood that he later became a monk.{{sfn|Sayers|2004}}{{refn|Richard may have been a married priest, as, during his son's later struggle with the Holy Roman Emperor, the latter asserted it was the case as a slur.{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} This was not unusual in the 12th-century church. The historian [[Anne Llewellyn Barstow]] says: \"Despite six hundred years of decrees, canons, and increasingly harsh penalties, the Latin clergy still...lived with their wives and raised families. In practice, ordination was not an impediment to marriage; therefore some priests did marry even after ordination.\"{{sfn|Barstow|1982|p=45}} The practice was generally confined to lower orders, such as [[subdeacon]]s, however, it may be that de Camera was one such.{{sfn|Brooke|2003|p=19}}|group=note}} As such, there are grounds for believing him to have been illegitimate.{{sfn|Brooke|2003|p=4}} Nicholas had a brother called either Ranulf or Randall, a [[clerk]] in [[Feering]], Essex.{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} Paris is also the source for Nicholas' surname being Breakspear.{{sfn|Sayers|2004}}\n\nParis recounts a story that Nicholas was rejected by [[Abbot of St Albans|Abbot Robert de Gorron]] from taking his [[novitiate]] at the abbey, although as Poole points out, the story is demonstrably incorrect as Robert did not become abbot until 1151.{{sfn|Poole|1969|p=292}} Sayers, suggests that, true or not, during and after Breakspear's pontificate, \"certainly St Albans fed upon the story of the local boy who had made good\".{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} William of Newburgh reports that Nicholas was too poor to receive anything more than a rudimentary education, and Brooke speculates that he travelled to France to learn the skills of a clerk. This was, he notes, a normal path to preferment in the 12th century, although it was more unusual for those that did so to have Breakspear's inauspicious background.{{sfn|Brooke|2003|p=19}} He may have become a [[Canon (priest)|canon]] at the [[Augustinian priory]] in [[Merton, Surrey]].{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} Poole subscribes to this theory, citing a letter to Breakspear when Pope in which he is reminded that \"your worship was wont to speak\" of Merton in conversation.{{sfn|Poole|1969|p=293}}\n\n===Move to France and promotion===\n[[File:St Alban&#039;s cathedral - geograph.org.uk - 1344.jpg|thumb|St Albans Abbey, now a Cathedral, seen in 2005|alt=Colour photograph of St Albans Abbey, now a cathedral|left]]\nThe next point at which Breakspear can be positively identified is in the French town of [[Arles]], where he continued his studies{{sfn|Parry|1997|p=18}} in [[canon law]],{{sfn|Duggan|2004|p=189 n.80}} and probably under the masters of Roman law also.{{sfn|Egger|2003|p=20}} On completion of his studies, he travelled south and became a [[canon regular]] at the priory of [[St Ruf]],{{refn|Also called St Rufus,{{sfn|Parry|1997|p=18}} this was an important regional [[motherhouse]].{{sfn|Zinn|1995|p=1481}}{{sfn|Morris|1989|p=190}}|group=note}} [[Avignon]]. He was soon appointed [[prior]]{{sfn|Poole|1969|p=291}} and then abbot.{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} While still a canon, in 1140 he appears to have written a charter in [[Barcelona]].{{sfn|Poole|1969|p=294}} However, there appear to have been complaints that he was overly strict,{{sfn|Norwich|2011}} and the monks rebelled.{{sfn|Poole|1969|p=294}} As a result he was summoned to Rome;{{sfn|Parry|1997|p=18}}{{sfn|Norwich|2011}} a temporary peace was established, but it was not long until the monks rebelled again.{{sfn|Poole|1969|p=294}} Breakspear may have visited Rome three times while at St Ruf\u2014\"each time with more conspicuous success\"\u2014and which would have consumed many months of his time.{{sfn|Poole|1969|pp=294\u2013295}}\n\nSayers suggests that it was while Breakspear was at St Ruf that he attracted the attention of [[Pope Eugenius III]],{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} who saw in him useful leadership qualities.{{sfn|Parry|1997|p=18}}{{refn|Eugenius may also have been an [[Anglophile]], as it appears that he once told John of Salisbury \"that he found the English admirably fitted to perform any task they turned their hand to, and thus to be preferred to all other races\u2014except, he added, when frivolity got the better of them\".{{sfn|Norwich|1970|p=172}}|group=note}} It is known that in 1147, while Eugenius was in [[Vico Pancellorum|Vico]] he granted one \"N. abbot of St Rufus\".{{sfn|Poole|1969|p=294}} It was probably in 1148 that Breakspear met who would become his good friend, John of Salisbury, in [[Rheims]],{{sfn|Brooke|2003|p=7}} and soon after when {{sfn|Morris|1989|p=190}}{{sfn|Bolton|2003a|p=75}} Eugenius appointed hi [[Cardinal-Bishop]] of [[Roman Catholic Suburbicarian Diocese of Albano|Albano]],{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} making Adrian at the time only the second Englishman to have been promoted to that rank.{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=355}}{{refn|The first had been the theologian [[Robert Pullen]], to the Cardinalate of [[SS.

The chapter was requested, says Egger, to \"help them in every possible way to conduct their business\".{{sfn|Egger|2003|p=27}}\n\nPoole questions the reasoning for Breakspear's episcopal promotion. Not only was his abbey an obscure one, with little political value or great endowment, but Breakspear's reasons for attending the Papal court were unlikely to have enabled him to make a name for himself. Indeed, on at least one occasion it was in response to a summons concerning his behaviour. However, suggest Poole, a possible explanation may have its roots in Breakspear's residency at Merton.{{sfn|Poole|1969|p=295}}{{refn|Poole suggests that in the early-to-mid-portion of the 12th century, Merton was much favoured by [[Roman Catholic Diocese of S\u00e9ez#Bishops|John, Bishop of S\u00e9ez]], and it had been Bishop John who had appointed Robert Pullen to the [[Archdeacon of Rochester#High Medieval|Archdeaconry of Rochester]]; by 1149, Pullen was Papal Chancellor and, Poole suggests, listened favourably to the recommendation of S\u00e9ez regarding Breakspeare, particularly as he was a fellow countryman.{{sfn|Poole|1969|p=295}}|group=note}} Duggan notes that the Cardinal Bishopric of Albino was part of the Pope's inner circle, which she suggests makes his rapid elevation to such a sensitive position all the more remarkable and indicative of the now-unrecognisable qualities that Eugenius saw in him.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=201}}\n\n===Voyage to Catalonia===\nIt was probably at the Council of Reims that Eugenius selected Breakspear for a mission to Catalonia,{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=33}}{{refn|The scholar Damian Smith notes a pre-existing connection between Breakspear and the region through his predecessor at St Ruf, Olegarius, abbot between 1113 and 1118,{{sfn|McCrank|1978|pp=162, nn.15+17}} and who had then been unwillingly promoted to the [[Bishopric of Barcelona]] and subsequently the [[Archbishopric of Tarragona]]. He also became an important advisor to Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona.{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=33}}|group=note}} possibly as a kind of unofficial legate to the crusaders.{{sfn|Constable|1953|p=25}} Breakspear met [[Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona]] who had been waging the latest campaign against the Moors since 1147. Although no records exist to show Breakspear was involved in the campaign itself, he was heavily involved in the reorganisation and administration of the [[Cistercian Order]], as well as arbitrating disputes within its congregation.{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=35}} It is likely that he was present at the [[Lleida|Siege of Lleida]] during the summer of 1149. He is less likely to have still been there in October, when it fell, as e had returned to Rome by December. However, he may well have brought news of another successful siege\u2014that of [[Tortosa]]\u2014which would have been particularly welcome to the \"bruised and battered\" papacy of Eugenius, says Damian Smith.{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=36}} Smith also notes that Breakspear's lengthy absence from St Ruf may have been a source of complaint by his monks, \"but this was surely not of prime importance to the Pope\".{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=36}} Egger suggests, however, that Breakspear's Catalonian mission was of great benefit to St Ruf, which became the blueprint for the religious houses created by Berenguer in the wake of the retreating Muslim empire.{{sfn|Egger|2003|p=25}}{{refn|St Ruf's observances, suggests Egger, became popular with the Catalonian nobility as well as the church, so was \"of no small advantage to the order\".{{sfn|Egger|2003|p=25}}|group=note}}\n\nAround mid-1152, he was despatched to [[Scandinavia]] as [[Papal legate]].{{sfn|Sayers|2004}}\n\n===Visit to Scandinavia, 1152===\n[[File:Trondheim-cathedral-1.jpg|thumb|upright=|Trondheim Cathedral, as seen in 2005|alt=modern photo of Trondheim Cathedral]]\nFormer [[Canon residentiary]] of St Albans Abbey, Andes Bergquist has described Breakspear's journey to northern Europe as \"one of the better documented\" of his career. It is possible that Boso\u2014from whom much of the information comes\u2014was in his entourage, although this is not certain.{{sfn|Bergquist|2003|pp=41, 42}} On his arrival, Norway was in a [[Civil war era in Norway|state of civil war]] and the authority of the King, [[Inge I of Norway|Inge I]], was neither strong nor respected. Breakspear reconciled the warring factions\u2014albeit temporarily\u2014and restored the monarchy.{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=349}} although no official record of his instructions survives, Bergquist suggests that they can be inferred from his actions: to divide the existing Archbishopric of Lund\u2014which covered both Norway and Sweden\u2013into two distinct national metropolitans, to arrange payment of Peter's Pence and to generally reorganise the church along Italian and European lines.{{sfn|Bergquist|2003|p=42}}\n\nBreakspear may have travelled to Norway via France and England{{sfn|Bergquist|2003|p=43}}\u2014where, Sayers speculates, he could have recruited merchant contacts who knew the region.{{sfn|Sayers|2004}}{{sfn|And\u00e5s|Ekroll|Haug|Petersen|2007|p=9}} His mission may have been kept quiet, as Bergquist notes his arrival seems t have been unexpected: Archbishop Eskil of Lund had recently left to visit France, and the King of Norway was on a military campaign.{{sfn|Bergquist|2003|p=44}} His first stop was Norway. At some point, Breakspear presided over a council at [[Nidaros]]. This council, says Robinson, \"strengthened the economic position of the church and the social status of the clergy\".{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=349}} Its timing though is difficult to ascertain, says Bergquist: Autumn 1152 seems to allow too little time to organise such a major council following his arrival, yet much later and the depth of a Norwegian winter is even more unlikely.{{sfn|Bergquist|2003|pp=44\u201345}}\n\nThe focal point of the [[Olaf II of Norway#Liturgical cult|cult of St Olaf]],{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=349}} Nidaros had until that point been only an episcopate.{{sfn|And\u00e5s|Ekroll|Haug|Petersen|2007|p=9}} Adrian's council was intended to promulgate [[Canon law of the Catholic Church|canons]].{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} To this end Breakspear made Nidaros a geographically-extensive ecclesiastical [[province]], covering the whole of Norway, Iceland and Greenland, as well as the [[Faroe Islands|Faroe]], [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland Island]]s. Breakspear also authorised the expansion of what was to become Europe's [[Trondheim Cathedral|most northerly medieval cathedral]], and its largest.{{sfn|And\u00e5s|Ekroll|Haug|Petersen|2007|p=9}} While in Norway he founded three [[cathedral schools]], at Nidaros in 1152 and two more at [[Bergen]] and [[Hamar]] the following year.{{sfn|Sj\u00e5vik|2008|p=63}} His work in Norway earned him the praise of contemporary Norwegian writer and politician, [[Snorri Sturluson]].{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=200}}\n\nIf the Council of Nidaros was held in the early months of 1143, suggests Bergquist, then it appears that Breakspear sailed to Sweden as soon as it was concluded.{{sfn|Bergquist|2003|p=44}} His activities in Sweden followed a similar course to those in Norway.{{sfn|Bergquist|2003|p=46}} He called another council, this time at [[Link\u00f6ping]], which reorganised the Swedish church under the [[Archbishop of Lund]] (it had previously been subject to German patriarchy).{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} He also received permission from the [[Swedish monarchy]] to introduce [[Peter's pence]]{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} and to reduce the influence of the lay community on the church generally.{{sfn|Bergquist|2003|p=46}} His visit to Sweden was recorded by contemporary chroniclers and published in the 13th century.{{sfn|Phelpstead|2001|p=xxxiv}} Similarly to what he had done in Norway with Trondheim,{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=349}} Adrian attempted to create an archepiscopal see for Sweden. This was opposed by one of the three provinces, [[Gothland]], and the venture came to nothing.{{sfn|Eden|2006|pp=292\u2013293}} According to Bergquist, Breakspear \"\"was taken aback by this unseemly conflict, and declared that neither people deserved this highest ecclesiastical honour\".{{sfn|Bergquist|2003|p=46}} Indeed, he suggests that it is possible that Breakspear's plans fell through thanks to the machinations of the recently-returned Archbishop Eskil. Eskil, having discovered that he had lost half his archepiscopate in his absence, may have stirred up the Swedes' and Goths' rivalries to ensure against losing any more. In the event, Breakspear appears to have repaired relations with Eskil, assuring him that Eskil would receive far more than he had lost. As a result, he placed Eskil in charge of the new Swedish metropolitan.{{sfn|Bergquist|2003|p=46}} \n\nDuggan describes Adrian's legation in the north has a \"diplomatic triumph\",{{sfn|Duggan|2003a|p=153}} being so successful, says Sayers, \"that he was later seen as the apostle of Scandinavia\".{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} Boso later lauded how Breakspear brought \"peace to the kingdoms, law to the barbarians, tranquillity to the monasteries, order to the churches, discipline to the clergy and a people pleasing to God, devoted to good works\".{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=349}} He successfully introduced a new Scandinavian [[tythe]]\u2014the ''denarium sancti Petri'', or payment to St Peter\u2014a financial acknowledgement by the Scandinavian church of Papal primacy.{{sfn|Sheehy|1961|pp=48\u201349}} Breakspear, argues the scholar Andrew Beck, \"gave the Swedish church its hierarchy and its attachment to Rome\".{{sfn|Beck|1940|p=383}}{{refn|Breakspear was one of two English clerics who influenced Scandinavian Christianity at this time; the other was [[Henry (bishop of Finland)|Henry, Bishop of Uppsala]], who was originally from St Albans.{{sfn|Singleton|1998|p=18}}|group=note}} He left Scandinavia in autumn 1154; he seems to have left a generally good impression in the region: A later [[Kings' sagas|saga]] refers to Breaksperare as \"the good cardinal...now considered a saint\".{{sfn|Bergquist|2003|p=41}} On his return to Rome he found Pope Eugenius had died the previous year, and that his successor had followed him only a few weeks before; the [[College of Cardinals]] was seeking a successor.{{sfn|Bergquist|2003|p=41}}\n\n==Political background==\n[[File:Plan of Rome in the Middle Ages - Historical Atlas by William R.

The [[Hohenstaufen]] [[Frederick Barbarossa]] had been elected [[Holy Roman Emperor]] on 4 March 1152.{{sfn|Barber|1992|p=101}} Barbarossa and Eugenius had contracted, at the [[Treaty of Constance]], to unite against both William of Sicily and the Roman Commune.{{sfn|Barber|1992|p=101}} {{refn|However, the contemporary chronicler of 12th-century Popes Boso, noted that\u2014notwithstanding the hostility of Rome to the Pope at this time\u2014these elections were peaceful and unanimous, although Boso did describe the election of Eugenius III as taking place in \"unexpected harmony\".{{sfn|Robinson|1996|p=78}} Sicily, a Papal fief in name only, provided its theoretical Papal lords with neither status nor income.{{sfn|Loud|2004|p=465}} Adrian's predecessor, Anastasia, had possessed a good grasp of the intricacies of Roman politics and had used his knowledge to maintain peaceful relations between all factions where possible.{{sfn|Maxwell-Stuart|1997|p=97}}|group=note}}\n\nUllmann has identified four major areas of concern for Adrian at the beginning of his pontificate: the city of Rome under Arnold of Brescia, the new Emperor who was marching towards Rome for his coronation, his counterpart in the east whose army had recently invaded southern Italy, and restlessness among the Pope's own vassals in his patrimony.{{sfn|Ullmann|1955|p=235}} By the time of Adrian's consecration, the city of Rome was a major player in Papal-Aristocatric regional politics.{{sfn|Wickham|2015|p=446}} Under the governance of a republican commune since 1144,{{sfn|Twyman|2003|p=49}} Pope Eugenius had recognised it the following year.

terms.{{sfn|Robinson|1996|p=464}} This was yet another external event\u2014indeed, probably the single most important event of the pontificate she argues\u2014that Adrian had had no way of influencing but had to deal with its consequences, notes Duggan.{{sfn|Duggan|2003a|p=153}} He was effectively captured and forced to come to terms at [[Benevento]]{{sfn|Abulafia|1988|p=56}}{{refn|Benevento was a Papal enclave inside Sicilian southern Italy, so Adrian was unable to escape easily.{{sfn|Abulafia|1988|p=56}}|group=note}} three weeks later.{{sfn|Loud|2004|p=456}} Ths one event, says Duggan, changed Adrian's policy for good, whether or not he liked it.{{sfn|Duggan|2003a|p=110}} As a result, at the [[Treaty of Benevento|Concordat of Benevento]], Adrian had to invest William with the lands he claimed in southern Italy, symbolised by the presentation of the Pope's own [[pennon]]ed lances and the kiss of peace.{{sfn|Norwich|1970|p=176}} The Pope was accepted as William's feudal overlord, while being forbidden from entering Sicily without an invitation from the King,{{sfn|Barber|1992|p=236}}{{refn|This did not apply to the mainland of Southern Italy, but, Barber points out, this was effectively the ''status quo'' in any case: Popes only entered the region four times between 1154 and 1189.{{sfn|Barber|1992|p=236}}|group=note}} thereby granting William effectively Legatine authority over the church in his own land.{{sfn|Loud|2004|p=456}} For his part, William gave the Pope his [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] and contracted to pay an annual tribute{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} and provide military support on request.{{sfn|Whalen|2014|p=126}} The treaty conferred extended powers on the Kings of Sicily that they would enjoy for at least the next 40 years, and included powers over ecclesiastical appointments traditionally held by the Popes as the region's feudal lord.{{sfn|Matthew|1992|p=193}}{{refn|These were greater powers than the Emperor enjoyed in his realm, and thus embittered relations between him and the Pope further.{{sfn|Matthew|1992|p=193}}|group=note}} Adrian's treaty with William angered the Emperor, who took it as a personal slight that Adrian had treated with the two Imperial rivals to Italy and confirmed his view of Adrian's Papal arrogance.{{sfn|Norwich|1970|p=180}} This, suggests Robinson, sowed the seeds of the disputed election following Adrian's death.{{sfn|Robinson|1996|p=79}}{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=378}}\n\nThe defeat of Manuel's army left the Pope vulnerable, and in June 1156 Adrian was forced to come to terms with the Sicilian King.{{sfn|Barber|1992|p=101}} This was, however, suggests Robinson, on generous terms, including \"homage and fealty, reparation for the recent encroachments on the papal patrimony, help against the Romans, freedom from royal control for the Sicilian church\".{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=378}} Adrian's new alliance with William exacerbated relations with Barbarossa,{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} who believed that Adrian had broken the Treaty of Constance twice over, by allying with both King William and the Byzantine Emperor.{{sfn|Robinson|1996|p=464}} Relations between Pope and Emperor were, argues Latowsky, \"irreparably damaged.{{sfn|Latowsky|2013|p=168}} Adrian probably acted as mediator the following year in concluding a peace treaty between William and Manuel.{{sfn|Robinson|1996|p=464}} The Emperor attempted to prevent the treaty by sending his most experienced diplomat, Abbot [[Wibald]] to intervene, as he probably saw a Sicilian\u2013Byzantine alliance as being directed against him.{{sfn|Freed|2016|p=195}}\n\nThe alliance with William had probably been strengthened by the Pope\u2019s belief that Barbarossa had already broken the Treaty of Constance.{{sfn|Freed|2016|p=152}} At the Treaty of Benevento, Adrian was represented by the Cardinals Ubald, Julius and Roland;{{sfn|Matthew|1992|p=65}} the Papacy was forced to cede much valuable land, rights and income to William.{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=367}} The Emperor felt personally betrayed: according to the contemporary chronicler [[Geoffrey of Viterbo]], the Pope, \"wish[ed] to be an enemy of Caesar\".{{sfn|Duggan|2003a|p=107}} Duggan, however, suggests that the Imperial alliance with the papacy had only ever been a [[flag of convenience]], \"ready to be discarded when it had served its purpose\".{{sfn|Duggan|2003a|p=154}}{{refn|Duggan suggests that once he had been elected as Emperor, all he needed was a puppet Pope, and that Adrian's policy of keeping the papacy on an independent course, was an \"intolerable provocation\".{{sfn|Duggan|2003a|p=154}}|group=note}} Bolton, meanwhile, suggests that, as Benevento was an Imperial town, the fact that following the treaty he stayed there for eight more months indicates that Adrian was asserting his power.{{sfn|Bolton|2003b|p=165}}\n\n==Problems in translation, 1157==\nBy 1157, suggests Whalen, having secured the border with the south (by his alliance with Sicily) and the commune as peaceful as it had been for some time, Adrian was able to reside in Rome again and \"stood in a more secure position than any of his predecessors had for decades\".{{sfn|Whalen|2014|p=126}} They were made worse in 1157 when, in a letter to the Emperor, Adrian referred to the Empire by the Latin term ''beneficium'', which some of Barbarossa's councillors translated as [[fief]], rather than [[benefice]]. This, they claimed, implied that the Pope saw the Empire as subordinate to the Papacy.{{sfn|Sayers|2004}}{{refn|The two parties used different terms to mean the same thing. Both originally used ''beneficium'' to mean a feudal holding. The church had begun using the term ''feudum'' a few years earlier; the Empire had not. It is, suggests Robinson, \"difficult to believe\" that the Curia had forgotten this.{{sfn|Robinson|1996|p=470}}|group=note}} The Emperor had to personally hold back [[Otto I, Duke of Bavaria|Otto of Wittelsbach]] from assaulting the Pope's messengers.{{sfn|Freed|2016|p=201}} Ullmann, however, argues that Adrian's use of the word was \"harmless enough...that he conferred the Imperial crown as a favour\".{{sfn|Ullmann|1955|p=244}} Duggan too describes the incident as \"at best a diplomatic incident\u2014a ''faux pas''\u2014which suggests carelessness on the part of the drafter\".{{sfn|Duggan|2003a|p=129}}{{refn|Who may have been Cardinal Roland, suggests Duggan.{{sfn|Duggan|2003a|p=129}}|group=note}} Historians have disagreed as to the degree of deliberation behind the use of the word. [[Peter Munz]], for example, belives it to have been a deliberate provocation, engineered by an anti-Imperial faction within the curia, designed to justify Adrian's treaty with King William. Anne Duggan, on the other hand, suggests this view is \"scarcely credible\": not only was Adrian in no position of strength from which to threaten Frederick, but he was also aware that the Emperor was planning a campaign against Milan for the following year, and would hardly wish to provoke him into marching on towards the Papal States.{{sfn|Duggan|2003a|p=129}} \n\nIn October 1157, Barbarossa was celebrating his wedding in [[Besan\u00e7on]]{{sfn|Ullmann|2003|p=123}} with an [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]],{{sfn|Whalen|2014|p=126}}{{refn|Besan\u00e7on was an important Imperial town, being the capital of [[Upper Burgundy]], and the Emperor's wedding celebration was attended by representatives of the crowned heads of Christendom; thus, notes Norwich, his falling out with the Pope was an exceedingly public one.{{sfn|Norwich|1970|p=180}}|group=note}} when he was visited by Papal legates [[Pope Alexander III|Roland]]{{refn|Roland had been a student of [[Gratian]] and had gone on to teach at the [[University of Bologna]]; with Roland, comments Ullmann, \"the dynasty of the great lawyer Popes was to begin\".{{sfn|Ullmann|2003|p=124}}|group=note}} and [[Bernard, Cardinal-Bishop of Porto|Bernard]].

Equally provocative, Freed suggests, was Adrian's later assertion that letters which criticised the Emperor's behaviour were somehow to his advantage.{{sfn|Freed|2016|pp=202\u2013203}} Adrian's \"sharp\" words also contributed to the Emperor's advisors increasing discontent with his messengers. The Pope had also ordered that, before any negotiations took place, the Emperor's council would accept Adrian's letters \"without any hesitation...as though proceeding from our mouth\".{{sfn|Freed|2016|p=205}} The cardinals appear to have worsened their reception by calling Frederick \"brother\".{{sfn|Duggan|2003a|p=132}}\n\nThe Emperor was also exasperated to find, on ordering the legates' quarters searched, blank parchments with the Papal seal attached. This he understood to mean that the legates had intended to present supposedly direct instructions from the Pope when they felt it necessary.{{sfn|Freed|2016|p=208}} Barbarossa claimed that he held his crowns directly from God and that Adrian \"did not understand his Petrine commission if he thought otherwise\".{{sfn|Abulafia|1988|p=63}} Following promulgation of Adrian' letter, says Godman, \"there was uproar\".{{sfn|Godman|2000|p=197}} Worse, says Barbarossa's contemporary [[chronicler]] [[Otto of Freising]], the legates compounded the insult by asking those present \"from whom the does he have the empire, if not from our lord the pope?\" The two [[ecclesiast]]s were then nearly beaten up, but the Emperor enabled their swift escape.{{sfn|Barber|1992|p=102}}\n\n=== Retranslation ===\n[[File:Adrian IV, servus servorum dei.png|thumb|upright-1.5|left|Adrian IV as depicted in a 12th-century [[Benedictine Order|Benedictine]] [[charter]]; the first line, from the [[initialism]], reads ''Adrianus eps servus servorum de'' (\"Adrian, bishop, servant of the servant of God\").{{sfn|Benedictine Charter|2020}}|alt=Adrian depicted in a contemporary charter]]\nIn June 1158, representatives of both sides met in the Imperial town of [[Augsberg]].{{sfn|Freed|2016|p=250}} Adrian attempted to pacify the Emperor and claimed that he meant, not \"fief\", but \"good deed\": \"Among us ''beneficium'' means not a fief but a good deed\", he wrote.{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=323}} Barber suggests, though, that \"his explanation was far from convincing\".{{sfn|Barber|1992|p=102}} On the other hand, notes the Emperor's biographer [[John Freed]], Barbarossa was [[illiterate]], and required everything translated.

Ullmann notes that canonicity \"was indubitably a double-edged weapon; if Adrian was an uncanonical pope, then Frederick was an uncanonical emperor, and that seems the only reason why this point was not pressed further\".{{sfn|Ullmann|1955|p=245}} Duggan summarises Adrian's Augsberg letter as being concomitant to one's interpretation of the original offence, noting that \"the context...determines everything\". While Munz views the Augsberg issuement as a \"humiliating\" retreat by Adrian, Duggan argues that, if one does not view the Besan\u00e7on letter as deliberately provocative, \"then there was no withdrawal from that provocation\".{{sfn|Duggan|2003a|p=130}}\n\nAdrian's choice of words may also have been a \"calculated ambiguity\", suggests Abulafia,{{sfn|Abulafia|1988|p=63}}{{refn|The ecclesiastical historian Z.

However, John fell out with King Henry for a now-unknown reason, and Adrian\u2014probably wishing to promote his friend but essentially a diplomat and a realist\u2014could not afford to alienate his only major supporter in northern Europe.{{sfn|Brooke|2003|p=12}} Adrian also favourably received at least two curial embassies from St Albans in 1156 and 1157.{{sfn|Bolton|2003a|p=75}}{{refn|Bolton notes, though, that even before their own \"loyal son\" become Pope, abbots of St Alban's \"did everything in their power to advance and promote the position of their house\".{{sfn|Bolton|2003a|p=79}}|group=note}} In 1156 Adrian ordered King Henry II to appoint an otherwise unknown Hugh to a London [[prebend]].{{sfn|Duggan|2007|p=156 n.3}} He wrote to [[Roger de Pont L'\u00c9v\u00eaque|Roger]], [[Archbishop of York]] two months after Adrian's election confirming the Papal Legates in their offices.{{sfn|Poole|1902|pp=704\u2013705}}\n\nAdrian had been absent from England since 1120, and it should not be assumed that he bore an automatic affection for the country which, in [[Richard Southern]]'s words, had given him \"no reasons to cherish warm feelings\" about it.{{sfn|Richter|1974|p=205}} However, in 1156, when John of Salisbury\u2014\"in circumstances which otherwise remain obscure\"\u2014had fallen into disgrace with the English King, Adrian regularly petitioned Henry for his friend's reinstatement.

Adrian's reasoning was that a [[sacrement]] outweighed a feudal due and that no Christian had the right to stand in the way of another's receiving of a sacrament. This was to become the definitive statement of marriage as a sacrament,{{sfn|Reynolds|2016|pp=40, 451}} and remained such until the recodification of [[1917 Code of Canon Law|Canon Law in 1917]].{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=190}} The same year, Adrian consecrated the [[Bishop of Gradisca|Bishop of Grado]], [[Enrico Dandolo (patriarch)|Enrico Dandolo]] as [[Dalmatia|Primate of Dalmatia]].{{sfn|Madden|2007|p=36}} Two years later, Adrian granted him primacy over all the Venetian churches in the Eastern Empire.{{sfn|Madden|2018|p=63}} This has been described as \"a remarkable move\": The historian [[Thomas F. Madden]] notes that not only did was this the first occasion on which one metropolitan had been given jurisdiction over another, but in doing so Adrian had created the equivalent of an Eastern [[Patriarch]] in the west.{{sfn|Madden|2012|p=80}} He also confirmed the degradation of [[Baume Abbey]] imposed by Eugenius for its failure to obey a Papal legate.{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=325 n.48}}\n\nAdrian confirmed the prerogatives of the [[Knights Templar]] and documented in the ''[[Liber Censuum]]''.{{sfn|Bellomo|2008|p=268}} He also enforced the rules against unfree ecclesiastical elections and condemned ecclesiastics who used physical force against the church.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=191}} Perhaps reflecting his earlier career, he also promulgated several bulls in favour of the [[Austin canon]]s. Again, he particularly focussed on houses of his personal association; St Ruf, for example, received at least 10 bulls of privilege. In one of these, he expressed a \"special bond of affection\" for his old abbey, which he said had been like a mother to him.{{sfn|Egger|2003|p=27}}\n\nAdrian argued that, in the troubled succession to [[Alfonso the Battler|Alfonso I of Aragon]], even though Alfonso had legally nominated an heir\u2014his brother\u2014because he had not had a son, his brother was not a direct heir to the Kingdom.{{sfn|Martindale|1989|p=27}} This was the context for the projected crusade into Spain as suggested by the Kings of England and France, which Adrian rejected. He did, however, welcome their new friendship.{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=39}}\n\nIt was probably Adrian who [[canonised]] [[Sigfrid of Sweden]] around 1158, thus making Sigfrid Sweden's [[apostle]].{{sfn|Beck|1940|p=384}} Robinson notes that Adrian's fascination with Scandinavia continued into his pontificate, particularly in his efforts to create a Swedish metropolis. He was also keen to defend its church against lay encroachment.{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=349}} In January 1157 Archbishop Eskil{{refn|Eskil was a personal friend of [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] and had been responsible for originally introducing [[monasticism]] to Denmark and Sweden.{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=350}}|group=note}} personally presented a petition to Adrian in Rome, requesting protection from [[Sweyn III of Denmark|King Swein of Denmark]].{{refn|Swein was also a vassal of the Holy Roman Emperor.{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=350}}|group=note}} Adrian both appointed the [[Bishop of Lund]] his Legate in the region{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=350}} and recognised him as [[primate]] over both Sweden and Denmark.{{sfn|Freed|2016|p=203}}{{refn|Eventually the three provinces agreed on Uppsala as the centre of the proposed metropolitan, and Alexander III conferred it in 1164.{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=349}}|group=note}} \n\nOther cardinalate appointments of Adrian's included that of Alberto di Morra in 1156. Di Mora, also a canon regular like Adrian, later reigned briefly as [[Pope Gregory VIII]] in 1187. Boso, already papal chamberlain since 1154, was appointed the same year. Adrian also elevated one Walter to the Pope's own Cardinal Bishopric of Albino; Walter is thought to have been an Englishman\u2014possible also from St Ruf\u2014but very little record of his career has survived. In contrast, his appointment of Raymond des Ar\u00e9nes in 1158 was of a well-known lawyer with an established career under Adrian's predecessors.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|pp=182\u2013183}} These were all worthy additions to the Curial office, argues Duggan, being all men of \"experience, academic learning and administrative and diplomatic skill\", which in turn reflects the wisdom of the appointer.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=183}} He may have received the hermit and later saint [[Silvester of Troina]], whose only recorded journey was from Siciliy to Rome during Adrian's pontificate.{{sfn|Oldfield|2014|p=131}}\n\nAdrian continued the reform of the Papacy's finances that had begun under his predecessor in an attempt at boosting revenue,{{sfn|Collins|2009|p=238}}{{refn|This process involved Boso, as Chamberlain examining old rent books from the archives in the hope of discovering lost Papal dues,{{sfn|Collins|2009|p=238}} and Adrian also ordered the keeping of more precise fiscal records,{{sfn|Whalen|2014|p=125}} which became the nucleus of the ''[[Liber Censuum]]''.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=182}}|group=note}} although he regularly had to resort to requesting large loans from major noble families such as the Corsi and [[Frangipane]].{{sfn|Wickham|2015|pp=164, 165 n.170}}{{refn|For example, a loan from Pietro Frangipane in 1158 of 1,000 [[Mark (currency)|marks]], for which a number of Papal castles had been given as security, was not paid off until 1190.{{sfn|Wickham|2015|p=228}}|group=note}} His appointment of Boso as Chamberlain\u2014or ''camerius''\u2014of the Papal patrimony did much to improve the Papacy's finances by way of streamlining its financial bureaucracy.{{sfn|Blumenthal|2004|p=23}} However, he also recognised the expense that the Papay was put to defending its own, commenting ''nemo potest sine stipendiis militare'', or \"no-one can make war without pay\".{{sfn|Morris|1989|p=214}} Adrian also consolidated the Papacy's position as the feudal lord of the regional baronage;{{sfn|Wickham|2015|p=54}} indeed, his success n doing so has been described as \"never less than impressive\".{{sfn|Bolton|2003a|p=178}} In 1157, for example, Adrian made [[Oddone Frangipane]] donate his castle to him, which Adrian then granted back to Oddone in fee.{{sfn|Wickham|2015|p=54}}{{refn|Wickhma argues this was Papal policy: \"aristocrats in Rome had to resign themselves to having possession of their lands, not full property\".{{sfn|Wickham|2015|p=54}}|group=note}} occasionally Adrian simply purchased castles and lordships for the papacy, as he did [[Corchiano]].{{sfn|Partner|1972|p=194}} Adrian received the personal oaths of fealty of a number of north-Roman nobles, thus making them vassals of St Peter.{{sfn|Whalen|2014|p=125}} In 1158, for example, for fighting in the ''[[Reconquista]]''\u2014\"subduing the barbarous peoples and the savage nations, that is, the fury of the Saracens\"\u2014Ramon Berenguer, Count of Barcelona was accepted \"under St Peter's and our protection\".{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=348}} In 1159 Adrian ratified an agreement with the civic leadership of [[Ostia (Rome)|Ostia]]\u2014an otherwise semi-independent town\u2014agreed to pay the Pope an annual feudal rent for his lordship.{{sfn|Wickham|2015|p=106}} Adrian's vassals, and their family and vassals, took oaths of fealty to the Pope, and in doing so the vassal absolved his own vassals of their oaths to him. All now became direct vassals of the Papacy.{{sfn|Bolton|2003b|pp=178\u2013179}} One of Adrian's greatest achievements, believed Boso, was acquiring [[Orvieto]] as a Papal fief, because this city had \"for a very long time withdrawn itself from the jurisdiction of St Peter\"{{sfn|Bolton|Duggan|2003|pp=230\u2013231}}{{sfn|Partner|1972|p=194}} Adrian, in 1156, was the first Pope to enter Orvieto, emphasised Boso, and to \"have any temporal power there\".{{sfn|Partner|1972|p=194}}\n\nAdrian appears to have been an advocate of the [[crusade]] since his abbacy of St Ruf,{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=32}} and was equally keen to rekindle the crusading spirit among Christian rulers as Pope. The [[Second Crusade|most recent crusade]] had ended, poorly, in 1150, but Adrian made what has been called a \"novel approach\" to launching a new one. In 1157 he announced that, whereas previously [[indulgence]]s were available to those who fought in the East, from now on they would be also available to those who supported the war effort without necessarily campaigning abroad. This opened the benefits of crusading up to those who supplied money, men or [[materiel]]. However, his proposal, novel or otherwise, appears to have met with little interest, and no further crusading was to take place until 1189.{{sfn|Freed|2016|pp=472\u2013473}}{{sfn|Tyerman|1998|pp=14\u201315}} He did not, however, approve of Crusading within Christendom itself, as when the French and English kings both proposed a crusade into [[Muslim Spain]], he urged cation upon them. In his January 1159{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=39}} letter ''Satis laudabiliter'', while flattering both kings diplomatically, he advised that \"it would seem to be neither wise nor safe to enter a foreign land without first seeking the advice of the princes and people of the area\".{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=191}} Indeed, Adrian reminded Henry and Louis of the consequences of badly planned and mismanaged crusades by reference to the Second Crusade\u2014of which Louis had been a leader\u2014reminding him that, there too, Louis had invaded \"without consulting the people of the area\".{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=192}}{{refn|He did however defer rather than deny the request for a crusade, as he intimated that, if his conditions were met\u2014i.e. that western princes were invited to do so\u2014he would then countenance their crusade.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=192}}|group=note}} \n\nAdrian also undertook a building program throughout Rome and the patrimony, although Duggan notes that the shortness of his pontificate reduced the amount of his work that remains visible in the 21st century. The work ranged from the restoration of public buildings and spaces to the city's physical defence.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=201}} Boso reported how, for example, \"in the church of St Peter [Adrian] richly restored the roof of St. Processo which he found collapsed\", while in the Lateran, he \"he caused to be made a very necessary and extremely large cistern\".{{sfn|Bolton|Duggan|2003|pp=230\u2013231}} Due to the peripatetic nature of his pontificate he also built a large number of summer palaces across the patrimony, including at [[Segni]], Ferentino, [[Alatri]], [[Anagni]] and [[Rieti]].{{sfn|Bolton|2003b|p=166}} Much of this fortification and building work\u2014particularly in the vicinity of Rome\u2014was for the protection of pilgrims, the safety of whom Adrian was both spiritually and physically reliable for.{{sfn|Partner|1972|pp=193\u2013194}}\n\nAlthough his pontificate was a relatively short one\u2014four years, six months and 28 days\u2014he spent nearly half that time outside of Rome, either in the enclave of Benevento or journeying around the Papal States and patrimony. Particularly in the early years of the reign, his travels reflected the political context, consisting of \"short bursts\" as he sought to either meet or avoid the Emperor or William of Sicily as the situation required.{{sfn|Bolton|2003b|p=164}}\n\n==Personal philosophy and religious views==\n[[File:Ego adrianus Catholicae.png|thumb|The [[autograph]] of Pope Adrian IV, reading ''Ego Adrianus Catholicae''{{sfn|Charter|2020}}|alt=image of Pope Adrian's signature]]\nThe Pope was conscious, comments Sayers, \"of the crushing responsibilities\" of his office,{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} telling John of Salisbury that he felt his Papal tiara to be \"splendid because it burned with fire\".{{sfn|Curtin|2019|p=23}} He was also highly conscious of the historicity of the Petrine tradition; as much as any of his predecessors, says Duggan, Adrian upheld the \"unifying and an co-ordinating role of the Papal office\", and regularly expressed himself on how he viewed his position as that akin to being a steward:{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=196}} He also recognised his own smallness within that tradition, telling John of Salisbury that \"the Lord has long since placed me between the hammer and the anvil, and now he must support the burden he has placed upon me, for I cannot carry it\".{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=197}} This explains his use of the [[Pope#Title|epithet]] ''[[Servus servorum Dei]]'', comments Duggan: more than purely rhetorical, it amalgamated his concept of \"stewardship, duty and usefulness\" in three words.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=197}}\n\n{{blockquote|text=Having been placed by the Lord's disposition in a lofty watchtower, if the rights of all churches are not preserved whole and unimpaired, we would seem to occupy the place of St Peter Prince of the Apostles unprofitably and to exercise the office of stewardship entrusted to us negligently.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=196}}}}\n \nAdrian was keen to emphasise the superiority of the Western Church over that of the East, and lost no opportunity to tell members of that body so.{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} \nAdrian described his approach to relations with his political rivals in a letter to the [[Metropolis of Thessaloniki#List of bishops|Archbishop of Thessaloniki]]. St Peter's authority was indivisible and could not be shared with temporal rulers, he argued. As such\u2014as [[Petrine doctrine|the descendent of St Peter]]\u2014neither should he.{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} Central to Adrian's view of his Papacy, says Sayers, was the conviction that his court was the highest court in Christendom and, so, the final court of appeal, and he encouraged appeals from many countries.{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} In an early letter, defending the principle of Papal Monarchy, he compares [[Christendom]] to the human body: all the parts can only function as they should if they have an overarching guide and facilitator. To Adrian, Christian Europe was the body, and the Pope the head.{{sfn|Ullmann|1955|p=236}} The historian Neil Hegarty has suggested that, on the assumption that ''Laudabiliter'' as is extant can be believed, Adrian firmly believed in \"enlarging the borders of the Church, setting bounds to the progress of wickedness, reforming evil manners, planting virtue, and increasing the Christian religion\".{{sfn|Hegarty|2011|p=60}} Adrian was keen to know what people thought of the Roman Church, and often asked the question of [[John of Salisbury]].{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} John also recorded Adrian's view's on the Papacy accepting gifts from Christians, which some viewed as [[Simony|simonaical]] and evidence of corruption. Adrian, reported John, replied with reference to the [[The Belly and the Members|fable of the belly]]. The European analyst Andreas Musolff explains the Pope's position as \"deducing from it the church\u2019s right to receive, and allocate, the nourishment to the Christian body according to merit and utility\".{{sfn|Musolff|2004|p=59}}  \n\nAdrian, argues Ullmann, was a man of action with little \"inclination towards lengthy theoretical discussions\",{{sfn|Ullmann|1955|p=234}} although Norwich argues that he could still be hesitant. For instance, following his radical change of Papal policy at Benevento, he may still not have grasped the significance of what he had done, and certainly not to the extent of radically exploiting the new policy.{{sfn|Norwich|1970|p=186}} Partner suggests that Adrian was \"an able administrator who used able agents\".{{sfn|Partner|1972|p=192}} He was also a traditionalist;{{sfn|Ullmann|1955|p=234}} a firm follower of Pope Gregory VII, Adrian believed it his duty to not just believe in those ideals, but to enforce them. He also believed in the necessity of reform,{{sfn|Richter|1974|p=206}} as his clarification of the marriage sacrament and enforcement of free episcopal elections demonstrates.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=191}} He was also, like Eugenius had been before him, a firm believer in the supremacy of the Bishops of Rome over both the Empire and other churches, writing how the Papacy,{{sfn|Robinson|2004|pp=323, 325}}{{blockquote|text=Like a diligent mother provides for the individual churches with constant vigilance: all must have recourse to her, as to their head and origin, to be defended by her authority, to be nourished by her breasts and freed of their oppressions.{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=325}}}}\n\n===Writings===\nThe 16th century [[jesuit]] commentator [[Augustino Oldoini]], in his re-edition of [[Alphonsus Ciacconius]]' ''Papal History'', that Adrian had authored a number of works prior to his election.

One such letter, from Hildegarde, exhorts him to crush the Roman commune. Joseph Baird and Radd Ehrman, editors of a collection of Hildegard's letters, note that it was \"perhaps unneeded\", as Adrian placed the city under Interdict almost immediately.{{sfn|Baird|Ehrman|1994|pp=20, 44}}{{refn|This particular letter has been described as expressing \"ideas which are themselves highly abstruse...where either the imagery is so contorted as to be intelligible only to the recipient, if in fact even to him, or as to be deliberately indecipherable\", as it contains references to a large number of [[allegorical]] animals.{{sfn|Baird|Ehrman|1994|pp=20, 44}}|group=note}} Much of Adrian's correspondence with both Archbishop Theobald and John of Salisbury has also been published in collections of the latter's letters.{{sfn|Millor|Butler|1986|pp=ix\u2013xii}}{{refn|In an early letter, Theobald berates Adrian for sending a messenger who \"has either betrayed his trust out of malice or lost them [Theobald's letters] through negligence or has falsely pretended that they were lost\", and advises Adrian to \"speak to your messenger at your good pleasure and, if it please you, give him instructions to carry out your business with greater caution and fidelity\".{{sfn|Millor|Butler|1986|p=20}}|group=note}}\n\nAdrian's episcopal registry is now lost,{{sfn|Freed|2016|p=142}} although some decretals\u2014formal rulings\u2014survive.{{sfn|Morris|1989|p=402}}{{sfn|Heather|2014|p=401}}{{refn|This compares, however, to 713 from Alexander III's pontificate.{{sfn|Morris|1989|p=402}}|group=note}} These covered such questions as to whether it was possible to restore a priest to his office when he had been responsible for the death of an apprentice, the payment of [[tithes]], and the marriage of the unfree.

He had granted it privileges of such breadth and grandeur\u2014which were confirmed by his successors\u2014that they caused rancour and jealousy in the English church.{{sfn|Bolton|2003a|p=95}}\n\nUllman suggests that it was Adrian who began the restoration of the [[Papal monarchy]] that would reach its apotheosis under Innocent III,{{sfn|Ullmann|2003|p=122}} while Bolton argues that \"only Innocent, the great Roman, realised the value to the papacy of following where Adrian, the unique Englishman, had led\".{{sfn|Bolton|2003b|p=178}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of popes]]\n*[[Cardinals created by Adrian IV]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|45em|indent=yes}}\n* {{cite book|last=Abulafia|first=D.|title=Frederrick II: A Medieval Emperor|year=1988|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19508-040-7|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=And\u00e5s|first1=M.

L. Poole speculates that Adrian may have been born many years later, as he was sent on a lengthy trip to Scandinavia in 1152, and, says Poole, \"so onerous a task would hardly have been imposed on a man past middle age\"{{sfn|Poole|1969|p=295}}|group=note}}{{snd}}1 September 1159, also '''Hadrian IV'''),{{sfn|Parry|1997|p=18}} was [[Pope]] from 4 December 1154 to his death in 1159. Born in [[Hertfordshire]], England, his father may have been a [[clerk]] and a [[monk]] called Robert, but his mother is unknown, and he may have been illegitimate. Although he does not appear to have received a great degree of schooling, while still a youth he travelled to France where he was schooled in [[Arles]], studying law. He then travelled to [[Avignon]], in the south, where he joined the abbey of [[St Ruf]]. There he became a [[Canons regular|canon regular]] and was eventually appointed abbot. He travelled to [[Rome]] several times, where he appears to have caught the attention of [[Pope Eugenius III]]. Eugenius sent him on a mission to [[Catalonia]], where the [[Reconquista]] was attempting to reclaim land from the Muslim [[Al-Andalus]]. Around this time his abbey complained to Eugenius that Breakspear was too heavy a [[disciplinarian]], and in order to make use of him as a [[papal legate]] as well as to pacify his monks, the Pope appointed Breakspear [[Bishop of Albano]] some time around 1149.\n\nAs Bishop, Breakspear was soon sent on another diplomatic mission, this time to [[Scandinavia]]. In the middle of [[Civil war era in Norway|a civil war]], Breakspear reorganised the church in Norway and then moved on to Sweden. Here he was very much accclamed by the people, and when he left, [[Chronicle|chroniclers]] called him a saint. Breakspear returned to Rome in 1154; the Pope had died only a few weeks previously. For reasons now unknown, but possibly at his predecessor's request, Breakspear was elected next Pope by the cardinals. He took the name Adrian IV. He was unable to complete his coronation service, however, because of the parlous state of politics in Rome, which at the time was a den of [[heresy]] and [[republicanism]]. Adrian decisively restored the papal authority there, but his other major policy issue\u2014relations with the newly-crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I\u2014]]<nowiki/>started off badly and got progressively worse. Each party, as a result of a particular aggravating incident, found something to condemn the other for. As a result, Adrian entered into an alliance with the [[Byzantine emperor]], [[Manuel I Komnenos]] who was keen to re-assert his authority in the south of Italy, but was unable to do so due to the [[Norman Kingdom of Sicily|Norman Kings]]' occupation of the region, now under [[William I of Sicily]].\n\nAdrian's alliance with the Byzantie emperor came to nothing, as William decisively defeated Manuel and forced Adrian to come to terms at the [[Treaty of Benevento]]. This alienated Emperor Frederick even more, as he saw it as a repudiation of [[Treaty of Constance (1153)|their existing treaty]]. Relations souted further when Frederick laid claim to a large swathe of territory in northern Italy. Adrian's elations with his country of birth, however, seem to have remained generally good. Certainly he showered [[St Albans Abbey]] with privileges, and he appears to have forwarded [[Henry II of England|King Henry II's]] policies where he could. Most famously, in 1158 Adrian is supposed to have granted Henry the [[papal bull]] ''[[Laudabiliter]]'', which is thought to have authorised Henry to invade Ireland. Henry did not do so, however, for another 14 years, and scholars are uncertain whether the bull ever existed.\n\nFollowing Adrian's death at [[Anagni]], there was uncertainty as to who to succeed him, with both pro- and anti-imperial cardinals voting for different candidates. Although officially [[Pope Alexander III]] officially took over, the concomitant election of an [[Antipope]] led to a 22-year-long schism. Scholars have debated Adrian's pontificate widely. Much of a positive nature\u2014his building program and reorganisation of papal finances, for example\u2014has been identified, particularly in the context of such a short reign. He was also up against powerful forces out of his control, which, while he never overcame them, he managed effectively.\n\n==Early life==\nThe son of Richard Breakspear,{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} his family was a relatively humble one.{{sfn|Summerson|2004}} The exact year of his birth is unknown but he was probably around 55 years old on his election.{{sfn|Norwich|2011}} Little is known{{refn|The only reliable source closest to his own life is that by Cardinal Boso in the ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'', but, comments Brooke, \"this is exceedingly terse on his early life\", noting only his nationality and voyage to France for learning.{{sfn|Brooke|2003|p=4}}|group=note}} of his background, and that which is, comments Brooke, \"savour[s] of gossip rather than sober history.{{sfn|Brooke|2003|p=4}} He was probably born in or around the Hertfordshire town of [[St Albans]]. As a result, much of that that is thought to be known may well be mythological \"tradition woven at the great abbey\" there.{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} Much of what is known is brought to historians by the writings of [[Boso (Cardinal)|Cardinal Boso]] and [[William of Newburgh]], both of whom were, however, writing over 30 years after Breakspear's death.{{sfn|Poole|1969|p=291}} As a result, notes Poole, there is a dearth of information\u2014and especially dates\u2014for Breakspear's life until his election as Pope, and \"all that can be said is that the dates commonly given are in every instance wrong\".{{sfn|Poole|1969|p=293}} The contemporary English [[chronicle]]r [[Matthew Paris]] says he came from [[Abbots Langley]],{{sfn|Maxwell-Stuart|1997|p=97}} although Paris mistakenly ascribes to his father the name [[Robert de Camera]].{{sfn|Brooke|2003|p=5}} Robert may have been a clerk{{sfn|Maxwell-Stuart|1997|p=97}}{{refn|Christopher Brooke also surmises that, with a surname such as \"Camera\", he was likely to have been a clerk.{{sfn|Brooke|2003|p=6}}|group=note}} although Sayers suggests that Paris' claim that Robert was a priest is probably correct, as is the likelihood that he later became a monk.{{sfn|Sayers|2004}}{{refn|Richard may have been a married priest, as, during his son's later struggle with the Holy Roman Emperor, the latter asserted it was the case as a slur.{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} This was not unusual in the 12th-century church. The historian [[Anne Llewellyn Barstow]] says: \"Despite six hundred years of decrees, canons, and increasingly harsh penalties, the Latin clergy still...lived with their wives and raised families.

This was, he notes, a normal path to preferment in the 12th century, although it was more unusual for those that did so to have Breakspear's inauspicious background.{{sfn|Brooke|2003|p=19}} He may have become a [[Canon (priest)|canon]] at the [[Augustinian priory]] in [[Merton, Surrey]].{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} Poole subscribes to this theory, citing a letter to Breakspear when Pope in which he is reminded that \"your worship was wont to speak\" of Merton in conversation.{{sfn|Poole|1969|p=293}}\n\n===Move to France and promotion===\n[[File:St Alban&#039;s cathedral - geograph.org.uk - 1344.jpg|thumb|St Albans Abbey, now a Cathedral, seen in 2005|alt=Colour photograph of St Albans Abbey, now a cathedral|left]]\nThe next point at which Breakspear can be positively identified is in the French town of [[Arles]], where he continued his studies{{sfn|Parry|1997|p=18}} in [[canon law]],{{sfn|Duggan|2004|p=189 n.80}} and probably under the masters of Roman law also.{{sfn|Egger|2003|p=20}} On completion of his studies, he travelled south and became a [[canon regular]] at the priory of [[St Ruf]],{{refn|Also called St Rufus,{{sfn|Parry|1997|p=18}} this was an important regional [[motherhouse]].{{sfn|Zinn|1995|p=1481}}{{sfn|Morris|1989|p=190}}|group=note}} [[Avignon]].

The chapter was requested, says Egger, to \"help them in every possible way to conduct their business\".{{sfn|Egger|2003|p=27}}\n\nPoole questions the reasoning for Breakspear's episcopal promotion. Not only was his abbey an obscure one, with little political value or great endowment, but Breakspear's reasons for attending the Papal court were unlikely to have enabled him to make a name for himself. Indeed, on at least one occasion it was in response to a summons concerning his behaviour. However, suggest Poole, a possible explanation may have its roots in Breakspear's residency at Merton.{{sfn|Poole|1969|p=295}}{{refn|Poole suggests that in the early-to-mid-portion of the 12th century, Merton was much favoured by [[Roman Catholic Diocese of S\u00e9ez#Bishops|John, Bishop of S\u00e9ez]], and it had been Bishop John who had appointed Robert Pullen to the [[Archdeacon of Rochester#High Medieval|Archdeaconry of Rochester]]; by 1149, Pullen was Papal Chancellor and, Poole suggests, listened favourably to the recommendation of S\u00e9ez regarding Breakspeare, particularly as he was a fellow countryman.{{sfn|Poole|1969|p=295}}|group=note}} Duggan notes that the Cardinal Bishopric of Albino was part of the Pope's inner circle, which she suggests makes his rapid elevation to such a sensitive position all the more remarkable and indicative of the now-unrecognisable qualities that Eugenius saw in him.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=201}}\n\n===Voyage to Catalonia===\nIt was probably at the Council of Reims that Eugenius selected Breakspear for a mission to Catalonia,{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=33}}{{refn|The scholar Damian Smith notes a pre-existing connection between Breakspear and the region through his predecessor at St Ruf, Olegarius, abbot between 1113 and 1118,{{sfn|McCrank|1978|pp=162, nn.15+17}} and who had then been unwillingly promoted to the [[Bishopric of Barcelona]] and subsequently the [[Archbishopric of Tarragona]].

Although no records exist to show Breakspear was involved in the campaign itself, he was heavily involved in the reorganisation and administration of the [[Cistercian Order]], as well as arbitrating disputes within its congregation.{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=35}} It is likely that he was present at the [[Lleida|Siege of Lleida]] during the summer of 1149. He is less likely to have still been there in October, when it fell, as e had returned to Rome by December. However, he may well have brought news of another successful siege\u2014that of [[Tortosa]]\u2014which would have been particularly welcome to the \"bruised and battered\" papacy of Eugenius, says Damian Smith.{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=36}} Smith also notes that Breakspear's lengthy absence from St Ruf may have been a source of complaint by his monks, \"but this was surely not of prime importance to the Pope\".{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=36}} Egger suggests, however, that Breakspear's Catalonian mission was of great benefit to St Ruf, which became the blueprint for the religious houses created by Berenguer in the wake of the retreating Muslim empire.{{sfn|Egger|2003|p=25}}{{refn|St Ruf's observances, suggests Egger, became popular with the Catalonian nobility as well as the church, so was \"of no small advantage to the order\".{{sfn|Egger|2003|p=25}}|group=note}}\n\nAround mid-1152, he was despatched to [[Scandinavia]] as [[Papal legate]].{{sfn|Sayers|2004}}\n\n===Visit to Scandinavia, 1152===\n[[File:Trondheim-cathedral-1.jpg|thumb|upright=|Trondheim Cathedral, as seen in 2005|alt=modern photo of Trondheim Cathedral]]\nFormer [[Canon residentiary]] of St Albans Abbey, Andes Bergquist has described Breakspear's journey to northern Europe as \"one of the better documented\" of his career.

Breakspear reconciled the warring factions\u2014albeit temporarily\u2014and restored the monarchy.{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=349}} although no official record of his instructions survives, Bergquist suggests that they can be inferred from his actions: to divide the existing Archbishopric of Lund\u2014which covered both Norway and Sweden\u2013into two distinct national metropolitans, to arrange payment of Peter's Pence and to generally reorganise the church along Italian and European lines.{{sfn|Bergquist|2003|p=42}}\n\nBreakspear may have travelled to Norway via France and England{{sfn|Bergquist|2003|p=43}}\u2014where, Sayers speculates, he could have recruited merchant contacts who knew the region.{{sfn|Sayers|2004}}{{sfn|And\u00e5s|Ekroll|Haug|Petersen|2007|p=9}} His mission may have been kept quiet, as Bergquist notes his arrival seems t have been unexpected: Archbishop Eskil of Lund had recently left to visit France, and the King of Norway was on a military campaign.{{sfn|Bergquist|2003|p=44}} His first stop was Norway. At some point, Breakspear presided over a council at [[Nidaros]]. This council, says Robinson, \"strengthened the economic position of the church and the social status of the clergy\".{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=349}} Its timing though is difficult to ascertain, says Bergquist: Autumn 1152 seems to allow too little time to organise such a major council following his arrival, yet much later and the depth of a Norwegian winter is even more unlikely.{{sfn|Bergquist|2003|pp=44\u201345}}\n\nThe focal point of the [[Olaf II of Norway#Liturgical cult|cult of St Olaf]],{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=349}} Nidaros had until that point been only an episcopate.{{sfn|And\u00e5s|Ekroll|Haug|Petersen|2007|p=9}} Adrian's council was intended to promulgate [[Canon law of the Catholic Church|canons]].{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} To this end Breakspear made Nidaros a geographically-extensive ecclesiastical [[province]], covering the whole of Norway, Iceland and Greenland, as well as the [[Faroe Islands|Faroe]], [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland Island]]s. Breakspear also authorised the expansion of what was to become Europe's [[Trondheim Cathedral|most northerly medieval cathedral]], and its largest.{{sfn|And\u00e5s|Ekroll|Haug|Petersen|2007|p=9}} While in Norway he founded three [[cathedral schools]], at Nidaros in 1152 and two more at [[Bergen]] and [[Hamar]] the following year.{{sfn|Sj\u00e5vik|2008|p=63}} His work in Norway earned him the praise of contemporary Norwegian writer and politician, [[Snorri Sturluson]].{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=200}}\n\nIf the Council of Nidaros was held in the early months of 1143, suggests Bergquist, then it appears that Breakspear sailed to Sweden as soon as it was concluded.{{sfn|Bergquist|2003|p=44}} His activities in Sweden followed a similar course to those in Norway.{{sfn|Bergquist|2003|p=46}} He called another council, this time at [[Link\u00f6ping]], which reorganised the Swedish church under the [[Archbishop of Lund]] (it had previously been subject to German patriarchy).{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} He also received permission from the [[Swedish monarchy]] to introduce [[Peter's pence]]{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} and to reduce the influence of the lay community on the church generally.{{sfn|Bergquist|2003|p=46}} His visit to Sweden was recorded by contemporary chroniclers and published in the 13th century.{{sfn|Phelpstead|2001|p=xxxiv}} Similarly to what he had done in Norway with Trondheim,{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=349}} Adrian attempted to create an archepiscopal see for Sweden. This was opposed by one of the three provinces, [[Gothland]], and the venture came to nothing.{{sfn|Eden|2006|pp=292\u2013293}} According to Bergquist, Breakspear \"\"was taken aback by this unseemly conflict, and declared that neither people deserved this highest ecclesiastical honour\".{{sfn|Bergquist|2003|p=46}} Indeed, he suggests that it is possible that Breakspear's plans fell through thanks to the machinations of the recently-returned Archbishop Eskil. Eskil, having discovered that he had lost half his archepiscopate in his absence, may have stirred up the Swedes' and Goths' rivalries to ensure against losing any more. In the event, Breakspear appears to have repaired relations with Eskil, assuring him that Eskil would receive far more than he had lost. As a result, he placed Eskil in charge of the new Swedish metropolitan.{{sfn|Bergquist|2003|p=46}} \n\nDuggan describes Adrian's legation in the north has a \"diplomatic triumph\",{{sfn|Duggan|2003a|p=153}} being so successful, says Sayers, \"that he was later seen as the apostle of Scandinavia\".{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} Boso later lauded how Breakspear brought \"peace to the kingdoms, law to the barbarians, tranquillity to the monasteries, order to the churches, discipline to the clergy and a people pleasing to God, devoted to good works\".{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=349}} He successfully introduced a new Scandinavian [[tythe]]\u2014the ''denarium sancti Petri'', or payment to St Peter\u2014a financial acknowledgement by the Scandinavian church of Papal primacy.{{sfn|Sheehy|1961|pp=48\u201349}} Breakspear, argues the scholar Andrew Beck, \"gave the Swedish church its hierarchy and its attachment to Rome\".{{sfn|Beck|1940|p=383}}{{refn|Breakspear was one of two English clerics who influenced Scandinavian Christianity at this time; the other was [[Henry (bishop of Finland)|Henry, Bishop of Uppsala]], who was originally from St Albans.{{sfn|Singleton|1998|p=18}}|group=note}} He left Scandinavia in autumn 1154; he seems to have left a generally good impression in the region: A later [[Kings' sagas|saga]] refers to Breaksperare as \"the good cardinal...now considered a saint\".{{sfn|Bergquist|2003|p=41}} On his return to Rome he found Pope Eugenius had died the previous year, and that his successor had followed him only a few weeks before; the [[College of Cardinals]] was seeking a successor.{{sfn|Bergquist|2003|p=41}}\n\n==Political background==\n[[File:Plan of Rome in the Middle Ages - Historical Atlas by William R.

Adrian's reasoning was that a [[sacrement]] outweighed a feudal due and that no Christian had the right to stand in the way of another's receiving of a sacrament. This was to become the definitive statement of marriage as a sacrament,{{sfn|Reynolds|2016|pp=40, 451}} and remained such until the recodification of [[1917 Code of Canon Law|Canon Law in 1917]].{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=190}} The same year, Adrian consecrated the [[Bishop of Gradisca|Bishop of Grado]], [[Enrico Dandolo (patriarch)|Enrico Dandolo]] as [[Dalmatia|Primate of Dalmatia]].{{sfn|Madden|2007|p=36}} Two years later, Adrian granted him primacy over all the Venetian churches in the Eastern Empire.{{sfn|Madden|2018|p=63}} This has been described as \"a remarkable move\": The historian [[Thomas F. Madden]] notes that not only did was this the first occasion on which one metropolitan had been given jurisdiction over another, but in doing so Adrian had created the equivalent of an Eastern [[Patriarch]] in the west.{{sfn|Madden|2012|p=80}} He also confirmed the degradation of [[Baume Abbey]] imposed by Eugenius for its failure to obey a Papal legate.{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=325 n.48}}\n\nAdrian confirmed the prerogatives of the [[Knights Templar]] and documented in the ''[[Liber Censuum]]''.{{sfn|Bellomo|2008|p=268}} He also enforced the rules against unfree ecclesiastical elections and condemned ecclesiastics who used physical force against the church.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=191}} Perhaps reflecting his earlier career, he also promulgated several bulls in favour of the [[Austin canon]]s. Again, he particularly focussed on houses of his personal association; St Ruf, for example, received at least 10 bulls of privilege. In one of these, he expressed a \"special bond of affection\" for his old abbey, which he said had been like a mother to him.{{sfn|Egger|2003|p=27}}\n\nAdrian argued that, in the troubled succession to [[Alfonso the Battler|Alfonso I of Aragon]], even though Alfonso had legally nominated an heir\u2014his brother\u2014because he had not had a son, his brother was not a direct heir to the Kingdom.{{sfn|Martindale|1989|p=27}} This was the context for the projected crusade into Spain as suggested by the Kings of England and France, which Adrian rejected. He did, however, welcome their new friendship.{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=39}}\n\nIt was probably Adrian who [[canonised]] [[Sigfrid of Sweden]] around 1158, thus making Sigfrid Sweden's [[apostle]].{{sfn|Beck|1940|p=384}} Robinson notes that Adrian's fascination with Scandinavia continued into his pontificate, particularly in his efforts to create a Swedish metropolis. He was also keen to defend its church against lay encroachment.{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=349}} In January 1157 Archbishop Eskil{{refn|Eskil was a personal friend of [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] and had been responsible for originally introducing [[monasticism]] to Denmark and Sweden.{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=350}}|group=note}} personally presented a petition to Adrian in Rome, requesting protection from [[Sweyn III of Denmark|King Swein of Denmark]].{{refn|Swein was also a vassal of the Holy Roman Emperor.{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=350}}|group=note}} Adrian both appointed the [[Bishop of Lund]] his Legate in the region{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=350}} and recognised him as [[primate]] over both Sweden and Denmark.{{sfn|Freed|2016|p=203}}{{refn|Eventually the three provinces agreed on Uppsala as the centre of the proposed metropolitan, and Alexander III conferred it in 1164.{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=349}}|group=note}} \n\nOther cardinalate appointments of Adrian's included that of Alberto di Morra in 1156. Di Mora, also a canon regular like Adrian, later reigned briefly as [[Pope Gregory VIII]] in 1187. Boso, already papal chamberlain since 1154, was appointed the same year. Adrian also elevated one Walter to the Pope's own Cardinal Bishopric of Albino; Walter is thought to have been an Englishman\u2014possible also from St Ruf\u2014but very little record of his career has survived. In contrast, his appointment of Raymond des Ar\u00e9nes in 1158 was of a well-known lawyer with an established career under Adrian's predecessors.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|pp=182\u2013183}} These were all worthy additions to the Curial office, argues Duggan, being all men of \"experience, academic learning and administrative and diplomatic skill\", which in turn reflects the wisdom of the appointer.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=183}} He may have received the hermit and later saint [[Silvester of Troina]], whose only recorded journey was from Siciliy to Rome during Adrian's pontificate.{{sfn|Oldfield|2014|p=131}}\n\nAdrian continued the reform of the Papacy's finances that had begun under his predecessor in an attempt at boosting revenue,{{sfn|Collins|2009|p=238}}{{refn|This process involved Boso, as Chamberlain examining old rent books from the archives in the hope of discovering lost Papal dues,{{sfn|Collins|2009|p=238}} and Adrian also ordered the keeping of more precise fiscal records,{{sfn|Whalen|2014|p=125}} which became the nucleus of the ''[[Liber Censuum]]''.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=182}}|group=note}} although he regularly had to resort to requesting large loans from major noble families such as the Corsi and [[Frangipane]].{{sfn|Wickham|2015|pp=164, 165 n.170}}{{refn|For example, a loan from Pietro Frangipane in 1158 of 1,000 [[Mark (currency)|marks]], for which a number of Papal castles had been given as security, was not paid off until 1190.{{sfn|Wickham|2015|p=228}}|group=note}} His appointment of Boso as Chamberlain\u2014or ''camerius''\u2014of the Papal patrimony did much to improve the Papacy's finances by way of streamlining its financial bureaucracy.{{sfn|Blumenthal|2004|p=23}} However, he also recognised the expense that the Papay was put to defending its own, commenting ''nemo potest sine stipendiis militare'', or \"no-one can make war without pay\".{{sfn|Morris|1989|p=214}} Adrian also consolidated the Papacy's position as the feudal lord of the regional baronage;{{sfn|Wickham|2015|p=54}} indeed, his success n doing so has been described as \"never less than impressive\".{{sfn|Bolton|2003a|p=178}} In 1157, for example, Adrian made [[Oddone Frangipane]] donate his castle to him, which Adrian then granted back to Oddone in fee.{{sfn|Wickham|2015|p=54}}{{refn|Wickhma argues this was Papal policy: \"aristocrats in Rome had to resign themselves to having possession of their lands, not full property\".{{sfn|Wickham|2015|p=54}}|group=note}} occasionally Adrian simply purchased castles and lordships for the papacy, as he did [[Corchiano]].{{sfn|Partner|1972|p=194}} Adrian received the personal oaths of fealty of a number of north-Roman nobles, thus making them vassals of St Peter.{{sfn|Whalen|2014|p=125}} In 1158, for example, for fighting in the ''[[Reconquista]]''\u2014\"subduing the barbarous peoples and the savage nations, that is, the fury of the Saracens\"\u2014Ramon Berenguer, Count of Barcelona was accepted \"under St Peter's and our protection\".{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=348}} In 1159 Adrian ratified an agreement with the civic leadership of [[Ostia (Rome)|Ostia]]\u2014an otherwise semi-independent town\u2014agreed to pay the Pope an annual feudal rent for his lordship.{{sfn|Wickham|2015|p=106}} Adrian's vassals, and their family and vassals, took oaths of fealty to the Pope, and in doing so the vassal absolved his own vassals of their oaths to him. All now became direct vassals of the Papacy.{{sfn|Bolton|2003b|pp=178\u2013179}} One of Adrian's greatest achievements, believed Boso, was acquiring [[Orvieto]] as a Papal fief, because this city had \"for a very long time withdrawn itself from the jurisdiction of St Peter\"{{sfn|Bolton|Duggan|2003|pp=230\u2013231}}{{sfn|Partner|1972|p=194}} Adrian, in 1156, was the first Pope to enter Orvieto, emphasised Boso, and to \"have any temporal power there\".{{sfn|Partner|1972|p=194}}\n\nAdrian appears to have been an advocate of the [[crusade]] since his abbacy of St Ruf,{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=32}} and was equally keen to rekindle the crusading spirit among Christian rulers as Pope. The [[Second Crusade|most recent crusade]] had ended, poorly, in 1150, but Adrian made what has been called a \"novel approach\" to launching a new one. In 1157 he announced that, whereas previously [[indulgence]]s were available to those who fought in the East, from now on they would be also available to those who supported the war effort without necessarily campaigning abroad. This opened the benefits of crusading up to those who supplied money, men or [[materiel]]. However, his proposal, novel or otherwise, appears to have met with little interest, and no further crusading was to take place until 1189.{{sfn|Freed|2016|pp=472\u2013473}}{{sfn|Tyerman|1998|pp=14\u201315}} He did not, however, approve of Crusading within Christendom itself, as when the French and English kings both proposed a crusade into [[Muslim Spain]], he urged cation upon them. In his January 1159{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=39}} letter ''Satis laudabiliter'', while flattering both kings diplomatically, he advised that \"it would seem to be neither wise nor safe to enter a foreign land without first seeking the advice of the princes and people of the area\".{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=191}} Indeed, Adrian reminded Henry and Louis of the consequences of badly planned and mismanaged crusades by reference to the Second Crusade\u2014of which Louis had been a leader\u2014reminding him that, there too, Louis had invaded \"without consulting the people of the area\".{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=192}}{{refn|He did however defer rather than deny the request for a crusade, as he intimated that, if his conditions were met\u2014i.e. that western princes were invited to do so\u2014he would then countenance their crusade.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=192}}|group=note}} \n\nAdrian also undertook a building program throughout Rome and the patrimony, although Duggan notes that the shortness of his pontificate reduced the amount of his work that remains visible in the 21st century. The work ranged from the restoration of public buildings and spaces to the city's physical defence.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=201}} Boso reported how, for example, \"in the church of St Peter [Adrian] richly restored the roof of St. Processo which he found collapsed\", while in the Lateran, he \"he caused to be made a very necessary and extremely large cistern\".{{sfn|Bolton|Duggan|2003|pp=230\u2013231}} Due to the peripatetic nature of his pontificate he also built a large number of summer palaces across the patrimony, including at [[Segni]], Ferentino, [[Alatri]], [[Anagni]] and [[Rieti]].{{sfn|Bolton|2003b|p=166}} Much of this fortification and building work\u2014particularly in the vicinity of Rome\u2014was for the protection of pilgrims, the safety of whom Adrian was both spiritually and physically reliable for.{{sfn|Partner|1972|pp=193\u2013194}}\n\nAlthough his pontificate was a relatively short one\u2014four years, six months and 28 days\u2014he spent nearly half that time outside of Rome, either in the enclave of Benevento or journeying around the Papal States and patrimony. Particularly in the early years of the reign, his travels reflected the political context, consisting of \"short bursts\" as he sought to either meet or avoid the Emperor or William of Sicily as the situation required.{{sfn|Bolton|2003b|p=164}}\n\n==Personal philosophy and religious views==\n[[File:Ego adrianus Catholicae.png|thumb|The [[autograph]] of Pope Adrian IV, reading ''Ego Adrianus Catholicae''{{sfn|Charter|2020}}|alt=image of Pope Adrian's signature]]\nThe Pope was conscious, comments Sayers, \"of the crushing responsibilities\" of his office,{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} telling John of Salisbury that he felt his Papal tiara to be \"splendid because it burned with fire\".{{sfn|Curtin|2019|p=23}} He was also highly conscious of the historicity of the Petrine tradition; as much as any of his predecessors, says Duggan, Adrian upheld the \"unifying and an co-ordinating role of the Papal office\", and regularly expressed himself on how he viewed his position as that akin to being a steward:{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=196}} He also recognised his own smallness within that tradition, telling John of Salisbury that \"the Lord has long since placed me between the hammer and the anvil, and now he must support the burden he has placed upon me, for I cannot carry it\".{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=197}} This explains his use of the [[Pope#Title|epithet]] ''[[Servus servorum Dei]]'', comments Duggan: more than purely rhetorical, it amalgamated his concept of \"stewardship, duty and usefulness\" in three words.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=197}}\n\n{{blockquote|text=Having been placed by the Lord's disposition in a lofty watchtower, if the rights of all churches are not preserved whole and unimpaired, we would seem to occupy the place of St Peter Prince of the Apostles unprofitably and to exercise the office of stewardship entrusted to us negligently.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=196}}}}\n \nAdrian was keen to emphasise the superiority of the Western Church over that of the East, and lost no opportunity to tell members of that body so.{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} \nAdrian described his approach to relations with his political rivals in a letter to the [[Metropolis of Thessaloniki#List of bishops|Archbishop of Thessaloniki]]. St Peter's authority was indivisible and could not be shared with temporal rulers, he argued. As such\u2014as [[Petrine doctrine|the descendent of St Peter]]\u2014neither should he.{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} Central to Adrian's view of his Papacy, says Sayers, was the conviction that his court was the highest court in Christendom and, so, the final court of appeal, and he encouraged appeals from many countries.{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} In an early letter, defending the principle of Papal Monarchy, he compares [[Christendom]] to the human body: all the parts can only function as they should if they have an overarching guide and facilitator. To Adrian, Christian Europe was the body, and the Pope the head.{{sfn|Ullmann|1955|p=236}} The historian Neil Hegarty has suggested that, on the assumption that ''Laudabiliter'' as is extant can be believed, Adrian firmly believed in \"enlarging the borders of the Church, setting bounds to the progress of wickedness, reforming evil manners, planting virtue, and increasing the Christian religion\".{{sfn|Hegarty|2011|p=60}} Adrian was keen to know what people thought of the Roman Church, and often asked the question of [[John of Salisbury]].{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} John also recorded Adrian's view's on the Papacy accepting gifts from Christians, which some viewed as [[Simony|simonaical]] and evidence of corruption. Adrian, reported John, replied with reference to the [[The Belly and the Members|fable of the belly]]. The European analyst Andreas Musolff explains the Pope's position as \"deducing from it the church\u2019s right to receive, and allocate, the nourishment to the Christian body according to merit and utility\".{{sfn|Musolff|2004|p=59}}  \n\nAdrian, argues Ullmann, was a man of action with little \"inclination towards lengthy theoretical discussions\",{{sfn|Ullmann|1955|p=234}} although Norwich argues that he could still be hesitant. For instance, following his radical change of Papal policy at Benevento, he may still not have grasped the significance of what he had done, and certainly not to the extent of radically exploiting the new policy.{{sfn|Norwich|1970|p=186}} Partner suggests that Adrian was \"an able administrator who used able agents\".{{sfn|Partner|1972|p=192}} He was also a traditionalist;{{sfn|Ullmann|1955|p=234}} a firm follower of Pope Gregory VII, Adrian believed it his duty to not just believe in those ideals, but to enforce them. He also believed in the necessity of reform,{{sfn|Richter|1974|p=206}} as his clarification of the marriage sacrament and enforcement of free episcopal elections demonstrates.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=191}} He was also, like Eugenius had been before him, a firm believer in the supremacy of the Bishops of Rome over both the Empire and other churches, writing how the Papacy,{{sfn|Robinson|2004|pp=323, 325}}{{blockquote|text=Like a diligent mother provides for the individual churches with constant vigilance: all must have recourse to her, as to their head and origin, to be defended by her authority, to be nourished by her breasts and freed of their oppressions.{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=325}}}}\n\n===Writings===\nThe 16th century [[jesuit]] commentator [[Augustino Oldoini]], in his re-edition of [[Alphonsus Ciacconius]]' ''Papal History'', that Adrian had authored a number of works prior to his election.

One such letter, from Hildegarde, exhorts him to crush the Roman commune. Joseph Baird and Radd Ehrman, editors of a collection of Hildegard's letters, note that it was \"perhaps unneeded\", as Adrian placed the city under Interdict almost immediately.{{sfn|Baird|Ehrman|1994|pp=20, 44}}{{refn|This particular letter has been described as expressing \"ideas which are themselves highly abstruse...where either the imagery is so contorted as to be intelligible only to the recipient, if in fact even to him, or as to be deliberately indecipherable\", as it contains references to a large number of [[allegorical]] animals.{{sfn|Baird|Ehrman|1994|pp=20, 44}}|group=note}} Much of Adrian's correspondence with both Archbishop Theobald and John of Salisbury has also been published in collections of the latter's letters.{{sfn|Millor|Butler|1986|pp=ix\u2013xii}}{{refn|In an early letter, Theobald berates Adrian for sending a messenger who \"has either betrayed his trust out of malice or lost them [Theobald's letters] through negligence or has falsely pretended that they were lost\", and advises Adrian to \"speak to your messenger at your good pleasure and, if it please you, give him instructions to carry out your business with greater caution and fidelity\".{{sfn|Millor|Butler|1986|p=20}}|group=note}}\n\nAdrian's episcopal registry is now lost,{{sfn|Freed|2016|p=142}} although some decretals\u2014formal rulings\u2014survive.{{sfn|Morris|1989|p=402}}{{sfn|Heather|2014|p=401}}{{refn|This compares, however, to 713 from Alexander III's pontificate.{{sfn|Morris|1989|p=402}}|group=note}} These covered such questions as to whether it was possible to restore a priest to his office when he had been responsible for the death of an apprentice, the payment of [[tithes]], and the marriage of the unfree.

He had granted it privileges of such breadth and grandeur\u2014which were confirmed by his successors\u2014that they caused rancour and jealousy in the English church.{{sfn|Bolton|2003a|p=95}}\n\nUllman suggests that it was Adrian who began the restoration of the [[Papal monarchy]] that would reach its apotheosis under Innocent III,{{sfn|Ullmann|2003|p=122}} while Bolton argues that \"only Innocent, the great Roman, realised the value to the papacy of following where Adrian, the unique Englishman, had led\".{{sfn|Bolton|2003b|p=178}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of popes]]\n*[[Cardinals created by Adrian IV]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|45em|indent=yes}}\n* {{cite book|last=Abulafia|first=D.|title=Frederrick II: A Medieval Emperor|year=1988|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19508-040-7|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=And\u00e5s|first1=M.

Rabin]]'s one-way function.\n\nBlum Blum Shub takes the form\n\n:<math>x_{n+1} = x_n^2 \\bmod M</math>,\n\nwhere ''M'' = ''pq'' is the product of two large [[prime number|primes]] ''p'' and ''q''. At each step of the algorithm, some output is derived from ''x''<sub>''n''+1</sub>; the output is commonly either the [[parity bit|bit parity]] of ''x''<sub>''n''+1</sub> or one or more of the least significant bits of ''x''<sub>''n''+1''</sub>.\n\nThe [[random seed|seed]] ''x''<sub>0</sub> should be an integer that is co-prime to ''M'' (i.e. ''p'' and ''q'' are not factors of ''x''<sub>0</sub>) and not 1 or 0.\n\nThe two primes, ''p'' and ''q'', should both be [[Congruence relation|congruent]] to 3 (mod 4) (this guarantees that each [[quadratic residue]] has one [[square root]] which is also a quadratic residue), and should be [[safe prime]]s with a small [[greatest common divisor|gcd]]((''p-3'')''/2'', (''q-3'')''/2'') (this makes the cycle length large).\n\nAn interesting characteristic of the Blum Blum Shub generator is the possibility to calculate any ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> value directly (via [[Euler's theorem]]):\n\n:<math>x_i = \\left( x_0^{2^i \\bmod \\lambda(M)} \\right) \\bmod M</math>,\n\nwhere <math>\\lambda</math> is the [[Carmichael function]]. (Here we have <math>\\lambda(M) = \\lambda(p\\cdot q) = \\operatorname{lcm}(p-1, q-1)</math>).\n\n==Security==\nThere is a proof reducing its security to the [[Computational complexity theory|computational difficulty]] of factoring.<ref name=blum1986 /> When the primes are chosen appropriately, and [[big O notation|''O'']]([[logarithm|log]] log ''M'') lower-order bits of each ''x<sub>n</sub>'' are output, then in the limit as ''M'' grows large, distinguishing the output bits from random should be at least as difficult as solving the Quadratic residuosity problem modulo ''M''.\n\n==Example==\nLet <math>p=11</math>, <math>q=23</math> and <math>s=3</math> (where <math>s</math> is the seed). We can expect to get a large cycle length for those small numbers, because <math>{\\rm gcd}((p-3)/2, (q-3)/2)=2</math>.\nThe generator starts to evaluate <math>x_0</math> by using <math>x_{-1}=s</math> and creates the sequence <math>x_0</math>, <math>x_1</math>, <math>x_2</math>, <math>\\ldots</math> <math>x_5</math> = 9, 81, 236, 36, 31, 202. The following table shows the output (in bits) for the different bit selection methods used to determine the output.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! [[Parity bit]]\n! [[Least significant bit]]\n|-\n| 0 1 1 0 1 0\n| 1 1 0 0 1 0\n|}\n\nThe following [[Common Lisp]] implementation provides a simple demonstration of the generator, in particular regarding the three bit selection methods.

At each step of the algorithm, some output is derived from ''x''<sub>''n''+1</sub>; the output is commonly either the [[parity bit|bit parity]] of ''x''<sub>''n''+1</sub> or one or more of the least significant bits of ''x''<sub>''n''+1''</sub>.\n\nThe [[random seed|seed]] ''x''<sub>0</sub> should be an integer that is co-prime to ''M'' (i.e. ''p'' and ''q'' are not factors of ''x''<sub>0</sub>) and not 1 or 0.\n\nThe two primes, ''p'' and ''q'', should both be [[Congruence relation|congruent]] to 3 (mod 4) (this guarantees that each [[quadratic residue]] has one [[square root]] which is also a quadratic residue), and should be [[safe prime]]s with a small [[greatest common divisor|gcd]]((''p-3'')''/2'', (''q-3'')''/2'') (this makes the cycle length large).\n\nAn interesting characteristic of the Blum Blum Shub generator is the possibility to calculate any ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> value directly (via [[Euler's theorem]]):\n\n:<math>x_i = \\left( x_0^{2^i \\bmod \\lambda(M)} \\right) \\bmod M</math>,\n\nwhere <math>\\lambda</math> is the [[Carmichael function]]. (Here we have <math>\\lambda(M) = \\lambda(p\\cdot q) = \\operatorname{lcm}(p-1, q-1)</math>).\n\n==Security==\nThere is a proof reducing its security to the [[Computational complexity theory|computational difficulty]] of factoring.<ref name=blum1986 /> When the primes are chosen appropriately, and [[big O notation|''O'']]([[logarithm|log]] log ''M'') lower-order bits of each ''x<sub>n</sub>'' are output, then in the limit as ''M'' grows large, distinguishing the output bits from random should be at least as difficult as solving the Quadratic residuosity problem modulo ''M''.\n\n==Example==\nLet <math>p=11</math>, <math>q=23</math> and <math>s=3</math> (where <math>s</math> is the seed). We can expect to get a large cycle length for those small numbers, because <math>{\\rm gcd}((p-3)/2, (q-3)/2)=2</math>.\nThe generator starts to evaluate <math>x_0</math> by using <math>x_{-1}=s</math> and creates the sequence <math>x_0</math>, <math>x_1</math>, <math>x_2</math>, <math>\\ldots</math> <math>x_5</math> = 9, 81, 236, 36, 31, 202. The following table shows the output (in bits) for the different bit selection methods used to determine the output.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! [[Parity bit]]\n! [[Least significant bit]]\n|-\n| 0 1 1 0 1 0\n| 1 1 0 0 1 0\n|}\n\nThe following Common Lisp implementation provides a simple demonstration of the generator, in particular regarding the three bit selection methods.

He concluded by finding criticism in the album's songwriting following that musical direction, \"By foregrounding her lyrical intent and offering no room for interpretation, Morris winds up with songs that feel less imaginative than their execution, a flaw that is by no means fatal but does mean that ''Girl'' plays on a smaller scale than intended.\"<ref name=\"AM\"/> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' editor [[Rob Sheffield]] felt that fans of Morris's \"scrappy attitude on ''Hero''\" will be oft-put by the \"happy midtempo love songs\" found in the album's second half but said that tracks like \"All My Favorite People\", \"Flavor\" and \"Make Out with Me\" will satisfy them, concluding that, \"She might be on her best behavior on this LP, but the liveliest moments come when she gets out of line.\"<ref name=\"RS2\"/> Laura Snapes of ''[[The Guardian]]'' felt the record goes for \"neither gutsy grandstanding nor Vegas-adjacent pop\" throughout its track listing, criticizing the \"biographical sincerity (\"Great Ones\", \"Gold Love\", \"Make Out with Me\")\" for lacking conviction and the misuse of Morris's \"compellingly hardbitten voice\" on songs that don't involve fractured romances, saying that Morris should take inspiration from fellow country artist [[Kacey Musgraves]] when recording her third album.<ref name=\"Guardian\"/>\n\n==Commercial performance==\n''Girl'' debuted and peaked at number four on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with 46,000 [[album-equivalent unit]]s, of which 25,000 were pure album sales in its first week.

It's clear that ''Girl'' isn't a sophomore slump, but rather an album worth investing in.\"<ref name=\"Exclaim\"/> [[AllMusic]]'s [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] called ''Girl'' \"bright, shiny, and big, an album designed to appeal to any imaginable audience\", noting how Morris goes for a \"pan-cultural pop\" soundscape that draws from different genres and delivers straightforward messages that's backed by equally strong production. He concluded by finding criticism in the album's songwriting following that musical direction, \"By foregrounding her lyrical intent and offering no room for interpretation, Morris winds up with songs that feel less imaginative than their execution, a flaw that is by no means fatal but does mean that ''Girl'' plays on a smaller scale than intended.\"<ref name=\"AM\"/> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' editor [[Rob Sheffield]] felt that fans of Morris's \"scrappy attitude on ''Hero''\" will be oft-put by the \"happy midtempo love songs\" found in the album's second half but said that tracks like \"All My Favorite People\", \"Flavor\" and \"Make Out with Me\" will satisfy them, concluding that, \"She might be on her best behavior on this LP, but the liveliest moments come when she gets out of line.\"<ref name=\"RS2\"/> Laura Snapes of ''[[The Guardian]]'' felt the record goes for \"neither gutsy grandstanding nor Vegas-adjacent pop\" throughout its track listing, criticizing the \"biographical sincerity (\"Great Ones\", \"Gold Love\", \"Make Out with Me\")\" for lacking conviction and the misuse of Morris's \"compellingly hardbitten voice\" on songs that don't involve fractured romances, saying that Morris should take inspiration from fellow country artist [[Kacey Musgraves]] when recording her third album.<ref name=\"Guardian\"/>\n\n==Commercial performance==\n''Girl'' debuted and peaked at number four on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with 46,000 [[album-equivalent unit]]s, of which 25,000 were pure album sales in its first week.
