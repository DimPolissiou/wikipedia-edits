Showing great athleticism at a very young age, he was scouted and was asked to move to Jang An Middle School where he continued training. His efforts did not go unnoticed as he was selected to be a part of the Under-15 National Youth Team of South Korea. As a testament to his remarkable performance as a young footballer, he once again had to move to Pung Sang High School to join a group of young men who would form the K1 League Seongnam Ilhwa FC's Youth Team. He went on to play for the said team and would eventually be one of only three players from his batch to secure a contract with Seongnam FC.\n\n==Club career==\n===Seongnam FC===\nLee secured a three-year contract with Seongnam FC when he was still in high school. Despite having already been selected to be a part of the K1 League Team's roster, Lee went on to pursue schooling at the Chung Ang University in Seoul. He continued playing football for the University Varsity Team and joining various tournaments in the age category. He remained exceptional at playing, eventually winning Most Valuable Player awards in tournaments such as the National Chungae Tournament of University.\n\nAfter finishing university, he went on to pursue his contractual obligation with Seongnam FC. He attended training sessions and games with Seongnam FC, but his stay would be short-lived as he needed to get into mandatory military training.\n\n===Hwasung FC===\nAs a norm in South Korea, it is compulsory to undergo a mandatory two-year military training for all young and able men. Lee was no exception, as he needed to go through the rigors of military training. He didn\u2019t pass up the opportunity to get into the military football team to continue training. He played for the entire duration of his stay in the military in what was considered the Third Division of the Korean Football League.\n\n===FC Meralco Manila===\nThe Philippines saw the introduction of the first ever professional football league in the country through the [[Philippines Football League]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.ph/football/news/finally-a-national-league-for-the-philippines-after-launch-of|title=Finally, a national league for the Philippines after launch of PFL - SPIN.PH|first=Christian|last=Jacinto|date=22 April 2017|publisher=}}</ref> In [[2017 Philippines Football League|its maiden season in 2017]], the PFL saw eight clubs competing for the first ever championship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/sports/04/24/17/eight-clubs-battle-in-inaugural-pfl-season|title=Eight clubs battle in inaugural PFL season|first=ABS-CBN|last=News|publisher=}}</ref> One of these clubs was FC Meralco Manila, formerly Loyola Meralco Sparks FC, which represented the Philippines\u2019 capital city of Manila.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aseanfootball.org/v3/pff-grant-licences-eight-clubs/|title=PFF grant licences to eight clubs \u2013 AFF \u2013 The Official Website Of The Asean Football Federation|website=www.aseanfootball.org}}</ref>\n\nLee was recruited to FC Meralco Manila as one of only four non-Filipino players in a roster of 26 athletes. As regulation provided for only four foreigners in a team, the selection process was rigorous, but Lee was easily chosen because he stood out in the pool of trainees. Upon selection to the team, he joined the team bannered by esteemed Filipino Coach [[Aris Caslib|Ariston Caslib]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/my/features/ffts-top-15-asean-managers-2017-who-are-our-regions-best-coaches|title=FFT's Top 15 ASEAN Managers, 2017: Who are our region's best coaches?|date=28 August 2017|publisher=}}</ref> and consisting of celebrated national team players from the Philippines.\n\nFC Meralco Manila went on the league series as the number one team after the eliminations round. Lee was instrumental to the success of the team, only missing 3 games at the start of the season due to recovery from ankle impingement during a pre-season practice game, and 1 match for a game suspension resulting from accumulated yellow cards.

Showing great athleticism at a very young age, he was scouted and was asked to move to Jang An Middle School where he continued training. His efforts did not go unnoticed as he was selected to be a part of the Under-15 National Youth Team of South Korea. As a testament to his remarkable performance as a young footballer, he once again had to move to Pung Sang High School to join a group of young men who would form the K1 League Seongnam Ilhwa FC's Youth Team. He went on to play for the said team and would eventually be one of only three players from his batch to secure a contract with Seongnam FC.\n\n==Club career==\n===Seongnam FC===\nLee secured a three-year contract with Seongnam FC when he was still in high school. Despite having already been selected to be a part of the K1 League Team's roster, Lee went on to pursue schooling at the Chung Ang University in Seoul. He continued playing football for the University Varsity Team and joining various tournaments in the age category. He remained exceptional at playing, eventually winning Most Valuable Player awards in tournaments such as the National Chungae Tournament of University.\n\nAfter finishing university, he went on to pursue his contractual obligation with Seongnam FC. He attended training sessions and games with Seongnam FC, but his stay would be short-lived as he needed to get into mandatory military training.\n\n===Hwasung FC===\nAs a norm in South Korea, it is compulsory to undergo a mandatory two-year military training for all young and able men. Lee was no exception, as he needed to go through the rigors of military training. He didn\u2019t pass up the opportunity to get into the military football team to continue training. He played for the entire duration of his stay in the military in what was considered the Third Division of the Korean Football League.\n\n===FC Meralco Manila===\nThe Philippines saw the introduction of the first ever professional football league in the country through the [[Philippines Football League]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.ph/football/news/finally-a-national-league-for-the-philippines-after-launch-of|title=Finally, a national league for the Philippines after launch of PFL - SPIN.PH|first=Christian|last=Jacinto|date=22 April 2017|publisher=}}</ref> In [[2017 Philippines Football League|its maiden season in 2017]], the PFL saw eight clubs competing for the first ever championship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/sports/04/24/17/eight-clubs-battle-in-inaugural-pfl-season|title=Eight clubs battle in inaugural PFL season|first=ABS-CBN|last=News|publisher=}}</ref> One of these clubs was FC Meralco Manila, formerly Loyola Meralco Sparks FC, which represented the Philippines\u2019 capital city of Manila.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aseanfootball.org/v3/pff-grant-licences-eight-clubs/|title=PFF grant licences to eight clubs \u2013 AFF \u2013 The Official Website Of The Asean Football Federation|website=www.aseanfootball.org}}</ref>\n\nLee was recruited to FC Meralco Manila as one of only four non-Filipino players in a roster of 26 athletes. As regulation provided for only four foreigners in a team, the selection process was rigorous, but Lee was easily chosen because he stood out in the pool of trainees. Upon selection to the team, he joined the team bannered by esteemed Filipino Coach [[Aris Caslib|Ariston Caslib]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/my/features/ffts-top-15-asean-managers-2017-who-are-our-regions-best-coaches|title=FFT's Top 15 ASEAN Managers, 2017: Who are our region's best coaches?|date=28 August 2017|publisher=}}</ref> and consisting of celebrated national team players from the Philippines.\n\nFC Meralco Manila went on the league series as the number one team after the eliminations round. Lee was instrumental to the success of the team, only missing 3 games at the start of the season due to recovery from ankle impingement during a pre-season practice game, and 1 match for a game suspension resulting from accumulated yellow cards.

Harry is whisked off by a group of wizards including [[Mad-Eye Moody]], [[Remus Lupin]] and several new faces including [[Nymphadora Tonks]] and [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]] to [[Number 12, Grimmauld Place]], the home of his godfather [[Sirius Black]]. The building also serves as the headquarters of the [[Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)|Order of the Phoenix]], a secret organisation founded by [[Albus Dumbledore]] which informs Harry that the [[Ministry of Magic]] is refusing to believe [[Lord Voldemort]]'s return. At the Order's headquarters, Sirius mentions that Voldemort is after a special object he did not have during his previous attack.\n\nHarry's expulsion is reversed at a hearing of the Ministry of Magic and he returns to Hogwarts for his fifth year, where Minister of Magic [[Cornelius Fudge]] has appointed a new [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] professor: [[Dolores Umbridge]]. Umbridge immediately clashes with Harry and punishes him for his \"lies\" about Voldemort by forcing him to write a message with a magic quill, scarring his hand. Despite the concern of his best friends [[Hermione Granger]] and [[Ron Weasley]], Harry refuses to report Umbridge's punishment to Dumbledore, who has mysteriously been ignoring Harry since the summer. As Umbridge's control over the school increases, Harry, Hermione and Ron form a secret group to train students in defensive spells, calling themselves \"[[Dumbledore's Army]]\". Umbridge tasks the [[Slytherin]] students with exposing the group, forming the \"Inquisitorial Squad\". Meanwhile, Harry and [[Cho Chang]] develop romantic feelings for each other.\n\nHarry has a vision involving an attack upon [[Arthur Weasley]], from the point of view of Arthur's attacker. Concerned that Voldemort will exploit this connection to Harry, Dumbledore instructs [[Severus Snape]] to give Harry [[Occlumency]] lessons to defend his mind from Voldemort's influence. This causes Harry to further isolate himself from his friends. Meanwhile, Sirius' deranged [[Death Eater]] cousin [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] escapes from [[Azkaban]] along with nine other [[Death Eaters]]. At Hogwarts, Umbridge and her \"Inquisitorial Squad\" expose Dumbledore's Army by forcing Cho to drink [[Potions in Harry Potter#Veritaserum|Veritaserum]]. Dumbledore escapes as Fudge orders his arrest. Umbridge becomes the new Headmistress.\n\nHarry's refusal to forgive Cho causes their relationship to fall apart. The Occlumency lessons end after Harry discovers through Snape's memories that Harry's father, James, often ridiculed him. After seeing another vision where Sirius is tortured by Voldemort, Harry, Ron and Hermione rush to Umbridge's fireplace to alert the Order via the Floo Network but are caught by her. Through cryptic language, Harry alerts Snape of the situation, who in turn alerts The Order. When Umbridge threatens to use the [[Magic in Harry Potter#Unforgivable Curses|Cruciatus Curse]] on Harry, Hermione tricks her into entering the [[Hogwarts#Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]] in search of Dumbledore's \"secret weapon\". Hermione and Harry lead Umbridge to the hiding place of [[Rubeus Hagrid]]'s giant half-brother [[Grawp]], only to be confronted by [[centaurs]] who kidnap Umbridge after she attacks and insults them.\n\nHarry, Hermione, Ron, [[Ginny Weasley]], [[Luna Lovegood]], and [[Neville Longbottom]] fly to the Ministry of Magic on [[Thestral]]s in an attempt to save Sirius. The six enter the [[Department of Mysteries]] and uncover a [[Prophecy (Harry Potter)|bottled prophecy]], the object Voldemort was after. However, they are ambushed by [[Death Eater]]s led by [[Lucius Malfoy]] and [[Bellatrix Lestrange]]. Lucius reveals that Harry only saw a dream of Sirius being tortured, which served as a ruse to lure Harry into the Death Eaters' grasp. Harry refuses to give Lucius the prophecy, causing a fight between Dumbledore's Army and the Death Eaters.\n\nThe Death Eaters capture Harry's friends, threatening to kill them unless he surrenders the prophecy. As Harry obliges, the Order arrive and attack the Death Eaters. This causes Lucius to drop the prophecy, destroying it. Just as Sirius overpowers Lucius, he is killed by Bellatrix. Voldemort appears, but Dumbledore arrives through the Floo Network moments before he can kill Harry. A duel between Voldemort and Dumbledore ensues, during which Bellatrix escapes. At an impasse with Dumbledore, Voldemort possesses Harry to tempt Dumbledore into sacrificing him but Harry, thinking of his friends and Sirius, manages to block Voldemort from his body.\n\nMinistry officials arrive right before Voldemort [[Apparition (Harry Potter)|disapparates]]; Fudge admits Voldemort's return and resigns as minister in disgrace.

Harry is whisked off by a group of wizards including [[Mad-Eye Moody]], [[Remus Lupin]] and several new faces including [[Nymphadora Tonks]] and [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]] to [[Number 12, Grimmauld Place]], the home of his godfather [[Sirius Black]]. The building also serves as the headquarters of the [[Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)|Order of the Phoenix]], a secret organisation founded by [[Albus Dumbledore]] which informs Harry that the [[Ministry of Magic]] is refusing to believe [[Lord Voldemort]]'s return. At the Order's headquarters, Sirius mentions that Voldemort is after a special object he did not have during his previous attack.\n\nHarry's expulsion is reversed at a hearing of the Ministry of Magic and he returns to Hogwarts for his fifth year, where Minister of Magic [[Cornelius Fudge]] has appointed a new [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] professor: [[Dolores Umbridge]]. Umbridge immediately clashes with Harry and punishes him for his \"lies\" about Voldemort by forcing him to write a message with a magic quill, scarring his hand. Despite the concern of his best friends [[Hermione Granger]] and [[Ron Weasley]], Harry refuses to report Umbridge's punishment to Dumbledore, who has mysteriously been ignoring Harry since the summer. As Umbridge's control over the school increases, Harry, Hermione and Ron form a secret group to train students in defensive spells, calling themselves \"[[Dumbledore's Army]]\". Umbridge tasks the [[Slytherin]] students with exposing the group, forming the \"Inquisitorial Squad\". Meanwhile, Harry and [[Cho Chang]] develop romantic feelings for each other.\n\nHarry has a vision involving an attack upon [[Arthur Weasley]], from the point of view of Arthur's attacker. Concerned that Voldemort will exploit this connection to Harry, Dumbledore instructs [[Severus Snape]] to give Harry [[Occlumency]] lessons to defend his mind from Voldemort's influence. This causes Harry to further isolate himself from his friends. Meanwhile, Sirius' deranged [[Death Eater]] cousin [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] escapes from [[Azkaban]] along with nine other [[Death Eaters]]. At Hogwarts, Umbridge and her \"Inquisitorial Squad\" expose Dumbledore's Army by forcing Cho to drink [[Potions in Harry Potter#Veritaserum|Veritaserum]]. Dumbledore escapes as Fudge orders his arrest. Umbridge becomes the new Headmistress.\n\nHarry's refusal to forgive Cho causes their relationship to fall apart. The Occlumency lessons end after Harry discovers through Snape's memories that Harry's father, James, often ridiculed him. After seeing another vision where Sirius is tortured by Voldemort, Harry, Ron and Hermione rush to Umbridge's fireplace to alert the Order via the Floo Network but are caught by her. Through cryptic language, Harry alerts Snape of the situation, who in turn alerts The Order. When Umbridge threatens to use the [[Magic in Harry Potter#Unforgivable Curses|Cruciatus Curse]] on Harry, Hermione tricks her into entering the [[Hogwarts#Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]] in search of Dumbledore's \"secret weapon\". Hermione and Harry lead Umbridge to the hiding place of [[Rubeus Hagrid]]'s giant half-brother [[Grawp]], only to be confronted by [[centaurs]] who kidnap Umbridge after she attacks and insults them.\n\nHarry, Hermione, Ron, [[Ginny Weasley]], [[Luna Lovegood]], and [[Neville Longbottom]] fly to the Ministry of Magic on [[Thestral]]s in an attempt to save Sirius. The six enter the [[Department of Mysteries]] and uncover a [[Prophecy (Harry Potter)|bottled prophecy]], the object Voldemort was after. However, they are ambushed by [[Death Eater]]s led by [[Lucius Malfoy]] and [[Bellatrix Lestrange]]. Lucius reveals that Harry only saw a dream of Sirius being tortured, which served as a ruse to lure Harry into the Death Eaters' grasp. Harry refuses to give Lucius the prophecy, causing a fight between Dumbledore's Army and the Death Eaters.\n\nThe Death Eaters capture Harry's friends, threatening to kill them unless he surrenders the prophecy. As Harry obliges, the Order arrive and attack the Death Eaters. This causes Lucius to drop the prophecy, destroying it. Just as Sirius overpowers Lucius, he is killed by Bellatrix. Voldemort appears, but Dumbledore arrives through the Floo Network moments before he can kill Harry. A duel between Voldemort and Dumbledore ensues, during which Bellatrix escapes. At an impasse with Dumbledore, Voldemort possesses Harry to tempt Dumbledore into sacrificing him but Harry, thinking of his friends and Sirius, manages to block Voldemort from his body.\n\nMinistry officials arrive right before Voldemort [[Apparition (Harry Potter)|disapparates]]; Fudge admits Voldemort's return and resigns as minister in disgrace. Umbridge is removed from Hogwarts, and Dumbledore returns as headmaster. Dumbledore explains that he distanced himself from Harry throughout the year, hoping it would lessen the risk of Voldemort using their connection. Harry comes to terms with the prophecy: \"Neither can live while the other survives.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{further|List of Harry Potter cast members}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[Daniel Radcliffe]] as [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]], a 15-year-old British [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]] famous for surviving his parents' murder at the hands of Voldemort as an infant, who now enters his fifth year at [[Hogwarts|Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].\n* [[Rupert Grint]] as [[Ron Weasley]], Harry's best friend at Hogwarts.\n* [[Emma Watson]] as [[Hermione Granger]], Harry's [[Fictional universe of Harry Potter#Muggle-born|Muggle-born]] best friend and the brains of the trio.\n* [[Helena Bonham Carter]] as [[Bellatrix Lestrange]], one of Voldemort's most loyal [[Death Eater]]s and the cousin of Sirius Black.\n* [[Robbie Coltrane]] as [[Rubeus Hagrid]], the half-giant Gamekeeper and [[Care of Magical Creatures]] teacher at Hogwarts and a member of the Order of the Phoenix.\n* [[Ralph Fiennes]] as [[Lord Voldemort]], leader of the Death Eaters, a dark wizard intent on conquering the Wizarding World.\n* [[Michael Gambon]] as [[Albus Dumbledore]], the legendary Hogwarts headmaster and leader of the [[Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)|Order of the Phoenix]].\n* [[Brendan Gleeson]] as [[Alastor Moody|Mad-Eye Moody]], Harry's ex-[[Defense Against the Dark Arts]] teacher and a member of the Order of the Phoenix.\n* [[Richard Griffiths]] as [[Vernon Dursley]], Harry's Muggle uncle.\n* [[Jason Isaacs]] as [[Lucius Malfoy]], a falsely pardoned senior Death Eater.\n* [[Gary Oldman]] as [[Sirius Black]], Harry's godfather and a member of the Order of the Phoenix.\n* [[Alan Rickman]] as [[Severus Snape]], the [[Magic in Harry Potter#Potions|Potions]] teacher at Hogwarts and the Head of [[Slytherin]]\n* [[Fiona Shaw]] as [[Petunia Dursley]], Harry's Muggle aunt.\n* [[Maggie Smith]] as [[Minerva McGonagall]], the [[Transfiguration (Harry Potter)|Transfiguration]] teacher at Hogwarts and a member of the Order of the Phoenix.\n* [[Imelda Staunton]] as [[Dolores Umbridge]], the new [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher and a plant from the corrupt [[Ministry of Magic]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_4360000/newsid_4365800/4365880.stm |title=Top actress \"will play Umbridge\" |publisher=BBC |date=21 October 2005 |accessdate=23 October 2006}}</ref>\n* [[David Thewlis]] as [[Remus Lupin]], Harry's ex-Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher and a member of the Order of the Phoenix.\n* [[Emma Thompson]] as [[Sybill Trelawney]], the [[Divination]] teacher at Hogwarts.\n* [[Julie Walters]] as [[Molly Weasley]], the Weasley matriarch and a mother figure to Harry, also a member of the Order of the Phoenix.\n<!-- Do Not Add Any More Cast -->\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Differences from the book==\n<!-- This should be integrated into the rest of the article -->\nAt 766 pages in the British edition and 870 in the American edition, ''Order of the Phoenix'' is the longest book in the ''Harry Potter'' series.<ref name=\"ewdif\">{{cite news |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20045813,00.html |title=What ''Phoenix'' leaves out |accessdate=9 October 2007 |last=Daly |first=Steve |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=13 July 2007}}</ref> Screenwriter [[Michael Goldenberg]] described his task to cut down the novel as searching for \"the best equivalent way to tell the story.

On 6 August 1945, during the final stages of [[World War II]], piloted by Tibbets and [[Robert A. Lewis]] it became the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|first aircraft to drop an atomic bomb]]. The bomb, code-named \"[[Little Boy]]\", was targeted at the city of [[Hiroshima]], Japan, and caused the near-complete destruction of the city. ''Enola Gay'' participated in the second atomic attack as the weather reconnaissance aircraft for the primary target of [[Kokura]]. Clouds and drifting smoke resulted in a secondary target, [[Nagasaki]], being bombed instead.\n\nAfter the war, the ''Enola Gay'' returned to the United States, where it was operated from [[Walker Air Force Base|Roswell Army Air Field]], [[New Mexico]]. In May 1946, it was flown to [[Kwajalein]] for the [[Operation Crossroads]] [[nuclear test]]s in the Pacific, but was not chosen to make the test drop at [[Bikini Atoll]]. Later that year it was transferred to the [[Smithsonian Institution]], and spent many years parked at air bases exposed to the weather and souvenir hunters, before being disassembled and transported to the Smithsonian's storage facility at [[Suitland, Maryland]], in 1961.\n\nIn the 1980s, veterans groups engaged in a call for the Smithsonian to put the aircraft on display, leading to an acrimonious debate about exhibiting the aircraft without a proper historical context. The cockpit and nose section of the aircraft were exhibited at the [[National Air and Space Museum]] (NASM) in downtown Washington, D.C., for the bombing's 50th anniversary in 1995, amid controversy. Since 2003, the entire restored B-29 has been on display at NASM's [[Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center]]. The last survivor of its crew, [[Theodore Van Kirk]], died on 28 July 2014 at the age of 93.\n\n==World War II==\n\n===Early history===\nThe ''Enola Gay'' (Model number B-29-45-MO,{{refn|The ''block number'' was a one- to three-digit number, followed by a two-letter code that represented the aircraft built to the same engineering specification.

Tibbets Jr.]], the commander of the [[509th Composite Group]], on 9 May 1945, while still on the [[assembly line]]. The aircraft was accepted by the [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) on 18 May 1945 and assigned to the [[393d Bomb Squadron|393d Bombardment Squadron, Heavy]], 509th Composite Group. Crew B-9, commanded by [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] [[Robert A.

It was initially given the Victor (squadron-assigned identification) number 12, but on 1 August, was given the [[USAAF unit identification aircraft markings#XXI Bomber Command|circle R tail markings]] of the [[6th Operations Group|6th Bombardment Group]] as a security measure and had its Victor number changed to 82 to avoid misidentification with actual 6th Bombardment Group aircraft.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=191\u2013192}}  During July, the bomber made eight practice or training flights, and flew two missions, on 24 and 26 July, to drop [[pumpkin bomb]]s on industrial targets at [[Kobe]] and [[Nagoya]].

Three days later, Bockscar (on display at [[National Museum of the United States Air Force|the U.S. Air Force Museum]] near Dayton, Ohio) dropped a second atomic bomb on Nagasaki, Japan. Enola Gay flew as the advance weather reconnaissance aircraft that day. A third B-29, The Great Artiste, flew as an observation aircraft on both missions.\n\n[[File:Enola Gay on Display at Udvar-Hazy.jpg|upright=2|thumb|right|{{center|The ''Enola Gay'' on display at the National Air & Space Museum, [[Steven F.

On 6 August 1945, during the final stages of [[World War II]], piloted by Tibbets and [[Robert A. Lewis]] it became the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|first aircraft to drop an atomic bomb]]. The bomb, code-named \"[[Little Boy]]\", was targeted at the city of [[Hiroshima]], Japan, and caused the near-complete destruction of the city. ''Enola Gay'' participated in the second atomic attack as the weather reconnaissance aircraft for the primary target of [[Kokura]]. Clouds and drifting smoke resulted in a secondary target, [[Nagasaki]], being bombed instead.\n\nAfter the war, the ''Enola Gay'' returned to the United States, where it was operated from [[Walker Air Force Base|Roswell Army Air Field]], [[New Mexico]]. In May 1946, it was flown to [[Kwajalein]] for the [[Operation Crossroads]] [[nuclear test]]s in the Pacific, but was not chosen to make the test drop at [[Bikini Atoll]]. Later that year it was transferred to the [[Smithsonian Institution]], and spent many years parked at air bases exposed to the weather and souvenir hunters, before being disassembled and transported to the Smithsonian's storage facility at [[Suitland, Maryland]], in 1961.\n\nIn the 1980s, veterans groups engaged in a call for the Smithsonian to put the aircraft on display, leading to an acrimonious debate about exhibiting the aircraft without a proper historical context. The cockpit and nose section of the aircraft were exhibited at the [[National Air and Space Museum]] (NASM) in downtown Washington, D.C., for the bombing's 50th anniversary in 1995, amid controversy. Since 2003, the entire restored B-29 has been on display at NASM's [[Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center]]. The last survivor of its crew, [[Theodore Van Kirk]], died on 28 July 2014 at the age of 93.\n\n==World War II==\n\n===Early history===\nThe ''Enola Gay'' (Model number B-29-45-MO,{{refn|The ''block number'' was a one- to three-digit number, followed by a two-letter code that represented the aircraft built to the same engineering specification.

Martin Company]] (later part of [[Lockheed Martin]]) at its [[Bellevue, Nebraska]], plant, located at what is now known as [[Offutt Air Force Base]]. The bomber was one of the 15 initial examples of [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29]]s built to the \"[[Silverplate]]\" specification\u201465 of these eventually being completed during and after World War II\u2014giving them the primary ability to function as nuclear \"weapon delivery\" aircraft. These modifications included an extensively modified bomb bay with pneumatic doors and British bomb attachment and release systems, reversible pitch propellers that gave more braking power on landing, improved engines with fuel injection and better cooling,{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=14\u201315}}<ref name=\"AirIll\">March, Peter R. \"Enola Gay Restored\".

Tibbets Jr.]], the commander of the [[509th Composite Group]], on 9 May 1945, while still on the [[assembly line]]. The aircraft was accepted by the [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) on 18 May 1945 and assigned to the [[393d Bomb Squadron|393d Bombardment Squadron, Heavy]], 509th Composite Group. Crew B-9, commanded by [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] [[Robert A.

It was initially given the Victor (squadron-assigned identification) number 12, but on 1 August, was given the [[USAAF unit identification aircraft markings#XXI Bomber Command|circle R tail markings]] of the [[6th Operations Group|6th Bombardment Group]] as a security measure and had its Victor number changed to 82 to avoid misidentification with actual 6th Bombardment Group aircraft.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=191\u2013192}}  During July, the bomber made eight practice or training flights, and flew two missions, on 24 and 26 July, to drop [[pumpkin bomb]]s on industrial targets at [[Kobe]] and [[Nagoya]]. ''Enola Gay'' was used on 31 July on a rehearsal flight for the actual mission.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=117}}\n\nThe partially assembled [[Little Boy]] [[gun-type fission weapon]] L-11, weighing {{convert|10000|lb}}, was contained inside a {{convert|41|in|cm|adj=on}} \u00d7 {{convert|47|in|cm|adj=on}} \u00d7 {{convert|138|in|cm|adj=on}} wooden crate that was secured to the deck of the {{USS|Indianapolis|CA-35|6}}.

''Enola Gay'', piloted by Tibbets, took off from [[North Field (Tinian)|North Field]], in the [[Northern Mariana Islands]], about six hours' flight time from Japan, accompanied by two other B-29s, ''[[The Great Artiste]]'', carrying instrumentation, and a then-nameless aircraft later called ''[[Necessary Evil (aircraft)|Necessary Evil]]'', commanded by Captain George Marquardt, to take photographs. The director of the [[Manhattan Project]], [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Leslie R. Groves, Jr.]], wanted the event recorded for posterity, so the takeoff was illuminated by floodlights. When he wanted to taxi, Tibbets leaned out the window to direct the bystanders out of the way.

In contrast to the Hiroshima mission, the Nagasaki mission has been described as tactically botched, although the mission did meet its objectives.

On 29 April 1946, ''Enola Gay'' left Roswell as part of the [[Operation Crossroads]] [[nuclear weapons tests]] in the Pacific. It flew to [[Kwajalein Atoll]] on 1 May. It was not chosen to make the test drop at [[Bikini Atoll]] and left Kwajalein on 1 July, the date of the test, reaching [[Travis Air Force Base|Fairfield-Suisun Army Air Field]], California, the next day.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=193}}\n\nThe decision was made to preserve the ''Enola Gay'', and on 24 July 1946, the aircraft was flown to [[Davis\u2013Monthan Air Force Base]], [[Tucson, Arizona]], in preparation for storage. On 30 August 1946, the title to the aircraft was transferred to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and the ''Enola Gay'' was removed from the USAAF inventory.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=193}} From 1946 to 1961, the ''Enola Gay'' was put into temporary storage at a number of locations. It was at Davis-Monthan from 1 September 1946 until 3 July 1949, when it was flown to [[O'Hare International Airport|Orchard Place Air Field]], [[Park Ridge, Illinois]], by Tibbets for acceptance by the Smithsonian. It was moved to [[Pyote Air Force Base]], Texas, on 12 January 1952, and then to [[Andrews Air Force Base]], Maryland, on 2 December 1953,{{sfn|Polmar|2004|p=66}} because the Smithsonian had no storage space for the aircraft.<ref name=\"An Exhibit Denied\" />\n\nIt was hoped that the Air Force would guard the plane, but, lacking hangar space, it was left outdoors on a remote part of the air base, exposed to the elements. Souvenir hunters broke in and removed parts. Insects and birds then gained access to the aircraft. [[Paul E.

By the early 1980s, two veterans of the 509th, Don Rehl and his former navigator in the 509th, Frank B. Stewart, began lobbying for the aircraft to be restored and put on display. They enlisted Tibbets and Senator [[Barry Goldwater]] in their campaign. In 1983, [[Walter J. Boyne]], a former [[B-52]] pilot with the [[Strategic Air Command]], became director of the National Air and Space Museum, and he made the ''Enola Gay''{{'}}s restoration a priority.<ref name=\"An Exhibit Denied\" /> Looking at the aircraft, Tibbets recalled, was a \"sad meeting.

Rather, the dispute was sometimes a symbolic issue in a \"culture war\" in which many Americans lumped together the seeming decline of American power, the difficulties of the domestic economy, the threats in world trade and especially Japan's successes, the loss of domestic jobs, and even changes in American gender roles and shifts in the American family. To a number of Americans, the very people responsible for the script were the people who were changing America. The bomb, representing the end of World War II and suggesting the height of American power was to be celebrated. It was, in this judgment, a crucial symbol of America's \"good war\", one fought justly for noble purposes at a time when America was united.

Its first full-length ballet was ''[[La Bayad\u00e8re]]'' (staging by Natalia Makarova) on 4 September 2008 at the [[Teatro Real]] in Madrid, Spain.\n\nBarcelona Ballet has since gone on to expand its repertoire and gain a great following across both Spain and the rest of the world.  They are a touring company performing in many theatres across Spain, including [[Teatro Real]], Madrid and the [[Liceu]], Barcelona. They have performed internationally at the [[New York City Center]] in March 2010  as well as at the [[Los Angeles Music Center]] and Santa Barbara, California. They have toured cities such as New Orleans, Seattle, Charleston, the [[Spoleto Festival]] and the Guadalajara book festival, Mexico in November 2010.\n\nTheir repertoire includes ''[[Swan Lake]]'', suites from ''[[Le Corsaire]]'' and ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]'', [[George Balanchine]]'s ''[[Tschaikovsky Pas de Deux]]'' and ''[[Apollo (ballet)|Apollo]]'' pas de deux, [[Christopher Wheeldon]]'s ''[[After the Rain (ballet)|After the Rain]]'' pas de deux, [[Mar\u00eda Pag\u00e9s]]' ''[[SOLE\u00c1]]'' pas de deux, and the pas de deuxs from ''[[Diana and Actaeon (ballet)|Diana and Actaeon]]'', ''[[Don Quixote (ballet)|Don Quixote]]'' and ''[[Le Diable amoureux (ballet)|Satanella]]''; [[George Balanchine|Balanchine]]'s ''[[Who Cares?
