Dunn, Jr., the name \"usually said to mean \"blackberry patch,\" or \"blackberry bush,\" this plant being considered an emblem of antiquity because it sprang up on the sites of old villages. This theory rests on the testimony of Barron, a longtime an old French trader on the Wabash. It is more probable that Kekioqa is a corruption or dialect form of Kiskakon, or Kikakon, which was the original name of the place.\" J. P.

At a very early time, they had a village on the Maumee River. Poinsatte, pg 23, fn 1</ref> or [[Pacanne|Pacan's]] Village,<ref>Andrew R. L. Cayton, ''Frontier Indiana'' (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1996; {{ISBN|0-253-33048-3}}), 86.</ref> was the capital of the [[Miami tribe]]. It was located at the confluence of the [[St. Joseph River (Maumee River)|Saint Joseph]], [[St. Marys River (Indiana)|Saint Marys]] and [[Maumee River|Maumee river]]s on the western edge of the [[Great Black Swamp]] in present-day [[Indiana]]. Over their respective decades of influence from colonial times to after the [[American Revolution]] and [[Northwest Indian Wars]], the [[France|French]], [[United Kingdom|British]] and Americans all established trading posts and forts at the large village, as it was located on an important portage connecting [[Lake Erie]] to the [[Wabash River|Wabash]] and [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] rivers. The European-American town of [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]] started as a settlement around the American [[Fort Wayne (fort)|Fort Wayne]] stockade after the [[War of 1812]].\n\n== History ==\nLong occupied by successive cultures of [[indigenous peoples]], Kekionga was a large village of the [[Miami people]] at the time of European encounter. It became an important trading post for Europeans because it was on the six-mile portage between the [[Maumee River|Maumee]] and the [[Little River (Indiana)|Little]] rivers, which connected [[Lake Erie]] to the [[Wabash River]] and [[Mississippi River]]. Due to the mid-17th century [[French and Iroquois Wars]]  over the fur trade, most traders believed the route was too dangerous.  Following the wars, however, the portage proved to be the shortest route between the French colonies of [[Canada, New France|New France]] (Canada) and [[Louisiana (New France)|La Louisiane]].<ref name=\"P1\">Poinsatte, 1-3</ref> The area was full of wildlife as it had not been densely inhabited for years.<ref>Poinsatte, 4</ref>\n\nThe Miami at first benefited from trade with the Europeans, who were primarily [[Canadiens]] from Quebec. Under [[Jean Baptiste Bissot, Sieur de Vincennes]], the Canadiens established a trading post and [[Forts of Fort Wayne, Indiana|fort]], first at the [[St. Joseph River (Maumee River)|St. Joseph River]], and later at Kekionga. Vincennes and the Miami developed a strong and enduring friendship.<ref name=\"Vincennes1\">\"Vincennes, Sieur de (Jean Baptiste Bissot),\" ''The Encyclopedia Americana'' (Danbury, CT: Grolier, 1990), 28:130.</ref>\n\nKekionga remained a central site for the Miami for several decades; their other villages were more temporary. The large meeting house hosted official tribal councils. However, a [[smallpox]] [[epidemic]] struck Kekionga in 1733 and people evacuated the village for a year.<ref>Carter, 66</ref> In a speech at the [[Treaty of Greenville]] (1795), [[Little Turtle]] called Kekionga \"that glorious gate ... through which all the good words of our chiefs had to pass from the north to the south, and from the east to the west.\"<ref name=\"P1\" /> \n \n=== Colonial period ===\nBritish merchants, seeking to expand their economic base, convinced some Miami to travel East for trade, in violation of the 1713 [[Treaty of Utrecht]]. In 1749, the pro-British [[La Demoiselle]] left Kekionga to establish the English trading village of [[Pickawillany]], which grew rapidly. Fighting between pro-French and pro-British villages broke out among the Miami in 1751, as tensions rose in the region. French officials tried to persuade the Miami to return to Kekionga, which was nearer their stronghold of [[Detroit]] and harder for the British to reach. Lieutenant Louis Coulon de Villiers was sent to the dilapidated Fort Miamis and given authority to commandeer French [[Coureur des bois|voyageurs]] to construct a new fort, which was finished in 1752.<ref>Barnhart, 100-111</ref> In the same year, the pro-French chief [[Cold Foot (Miami)|Cold Foot]] died at Kekionga in another smallpox epidemic. When the French-allied [[Three Fires Confederacy]] destroyed Pickawillany, most of the surviving Miami returned to Kekionga, which stopped assisting the French.<ref>[http://www.gbl.indiana.edu/archives/dockett_317a/317a_3f.html Wheeler-Voegelin, Pg 73] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315061856/http://www.gbl.indiana.edu/archives/dockett_317a/317a_3f.html |date=2008-03-15 }}.</ref>\n\nAfter the [[French and Indian War]] (1756-1763) ended with the French defeated, France ceded Canada to the British Empire. The Miami of Kekionga became involved in [[Pontiac's Rebellion]] in the spring of 1763, capturing the British garrison and killing the two ranking officers. The following year, [[Pacanne]] emerged as the village chief when he spared the life of the captive Captain [[Thomas Morris (British Army officer)|Thomas Morris]] and returned him to Detroit. By 1765, Kekionga had accepted the British. Deputy commissioner [[George Croghan]] described Kekionga:\n\n<blockquote>The Twightwee Village is situated on both Sides of a River called St. Joseph's ...

A Miami force led by Chief [[Little Turtle]] destroyed the French force. The Miami and the European-American traders of Kekionga remained economically tied to the British-held [[Fort Detroit]], even after the British ceded all claims of the [[Northwest Territory]] to the new United States following the war in the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]].\n\nIn 1790, the Canadian Governor [[Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester|Guy Carleton]] warned the government in London that the loss of Kekionga would result in grave economic hardships to Detroit. He estimated that Kekionga annually produced 2000 packs of pelts, worth about \u00a324,000 sterling. This was twice the value of the next most important trade area, between Detroit and Lake Huron.<ref>Poinsatte, 17</ref>\n\nDuring the winter of 1789/1790, the traders Henry Hay and [[John Kinzie]] stayed in Kekionga.  Hay kept a daily journal, which recorded their regular routines of drinking, dancing, and parties, as well as weekly [[Mass]]. Hay played the flute and Kinzie played the fiddle, which made them popular with the inhabitants of Kekionga. Although Hay and Kinzie stayed primarily in the French-speaking village in Kekionga, they also described some of the Miami villages.

It was located at the confluence of the [[St. Joseph River (Maumee River)|Saint Joseph]], [[St. Marys River (Indiana)|Saint Marys]] and [[Maumee River|Maumee river]]s on the western edge of the [[Great Black Swamp]] in present-day [[Indiana]]. Over their respective decades of influence from colonial times to after the [[American Revolution]] and [[Northwest Indian Wars]], the [[France|French]], [[United Kingdom|British]] and Americans all established trading posts and forts at the large village, as it was located on an important portage connecting [[Lake Erie]] to the [[Wabash River|Wabash]] and [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] rivers. The European-American town of [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]] started as a settlement around the American [[Fort Wayne (fort)|Fort Wayne]] stockade after the [[War of 1812]].\n\n== History ==\nLong occupied by successive cultures of [[indigenous peoples]], Kekionga was a large village of the [[Miami people]] at the time of European encounter. It became an important trading post for Europeans because it was on the six-mile portage between the [[Maumee River|Maumee]] and the [[Little River (Indiana)|Little]] rivers, which connected [[Lake Erie]] to the [[Wabash River]] and [[Mississippi River]]. Due to the mid-17th century [[French and Iroquois Wars]]  over the fur trade, most traders believed the route was too dangerous.  Following the wars, however, the portage proved to be the shortest route between the French colonies of [[Canada, New France|New France]] (Canada) and [[Louisiana (New France)|La Louisiane]].<ref name=\"P1\">Poinsatte, 1-3</ref> The area was full of wildlife as it had not been densely inhabited for years.<ref>Poinsatte, 4</ref>\n\nThe Miami at first benefited from trade with the Europeans, who were primarily [[Canadiens]] from Quebec. Under [[Jean Baptiste Bissot, Sieur de Vincennes]], the Canadiens established a trading post and [[Forts of Fort Wayne, Indiana|fort]], first at the [[St. Joseph River (Maumee River)|St. Joseph River]], and later at Kekionga. Vincennes and the Miami developed a strong and enduring friendship.<ref name=\"Vincennes1\">\"Vincennes, Sieur de (Jean Baptiste Bissot),\" ''The Encyclopedia Americana'' (Danbury, CT: Grolier, 1990), 28:130.</ref>\n\nKekionga remained a central site for the Miami for several decades; their other villages were more temporary. The large meeting house hosted official tribal councils. However, a [[smallpox]] [[epidemic]] struck Kekionga in 1733 and people evacuated the village for a year.<ref>Carter, 66</ref> In a speech at the [[Treaty of Greenville]] (1795), [[Little Turtle]] called Kekionga \"that glorious gate ... through which all the good words of our chiefs had to pass from the north to the south, and from the east to the west.\"<ref name=\"P1\" /> \n \n=== Colonial period ===\nBritish merchants, seeking to expand their economic base, convinced some Miami to travel East for trade, in violation of the 1713 [[Treaty of Utrecht]]. In 1749, the pro-British [[La Demoiselle]] left Kekionga to establish the English trading village of [[Pickawillany]], which grew rapidly. Fighting between pro-French and pro-British villages broke out among the Miami in 1751, as tensions rose in the region. French officials tried to persuade the Miami to return to Kekionga, which was nearer their stronghold of [[Detroit]] and harder for the British to reach. Lieutenant Louis Coulon de Villiers was sent to the dilapidated Fort Miamis and given authority to commandeer French [[Coureur des bois|voyageurs]] to construct a new fort, which was finished in 1752.<ref>Barnhart, 100-111</ref> In the same year, the pro-French chief [[Cold Foot (Miami)|Cold Foot]] died at Kekionga in another smallpox epidemic. When the French-allied [[Three Fires Confederacy]] destroyed Pickawillany, most of the surviving Miami returned to Kekionga, which stopped assisting the French.<ref>[http://www.gbl.indiana.edu/archives/dockett_317a/317a_3f.html Wheeler-Voegelin, Pg 73] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315061856/http://www.gbl.indiana.edu/archives/dockett_317a/317a_3f.html |date=2008-03-15 }}.</ref>\n\nAfter the [[French and Indian War]] (1756-1763) ended with the French defeated, France ceded Canada to the British Empire. The Miami of Kekionga became involved in [[Pontiac's Rebellion]] in the spring of 1763, capturing the British garrison and killing the two ranking officers. The following year, [[Pacanne]] emerged as the village chief when he spared the life of the captive Captain [[Thomas Morris (British Army officer)|Thomas Morris]] and returned him to Detroit. By 1765, Kekionga had accepted the British. Deputy commissioner [[George Croghan]] described Kekionga:\n\n<blockquote>The Twightwee Village is situated on both Sides of a River called St. Joseph's ...
