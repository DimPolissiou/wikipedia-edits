Faludi argues that while many of those in power are men, most individual men have little power. American men have been brought up to be strong, support their families and work hard. But many men who followed this now find themselves underpaid or unemployed, disillusioned and abandoned by their wives. Changes in American society have affected both men and women, Faludi concludes, and it is wrong to blame individual men for class differences, or for plain differences in individual luck and ability, that they did not cause and from which men and women suffer alike.<ref>{{cite book | last = Faludi| first = Susan | authorlink = Susan Faludi| title = [[Stiffed: The Betrayal of the American Man]]| series = | date = October 1, 2000| publisher = Harper Perennial| isbn= 0-380-72045-0}}</ref>\n* In ''[[The Terror Dream]]'' Faludi analyzes the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]] in light of prior American experience going back to insecurity on the historical [[American frontier]] such as in [[King Philip's War|Metacom's Rebellion]].

Faludi argues that while many of those in power are men, most individual men have little power. American men have been brought up to be strong, support their families and work hard. But many men who followed this now find themselves underpaid or unemployed, disillusioned and abandoned by their wives. Changes in American society have affected both men and women, Faludi concludes, and it is wrong to blame individual men for class differences, or for plain differences in individual luck and ability, that they did not cause and from which men and women suffer alike.<ref>{{cite book | last = Faludi| first = Susan | authorlink = Susan Faludi| title = [[Stiffed: The Betrayal of the American Man]]| series = | date = October 1, 2000| publisher = Harper Perennial| isbn= 0-380-72045-0}}</ref>\n* In ''[[The Terror Dream]]'' Faludi analyzes the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]] in light of prior American experience going back to insecurity on the historical [[American frontier]] such as in [[King Philip's War|Metacom's Rebellion]].

Gort made a pact with him that would allow him to defeat his then nemesis, Leon. After completion of this, Mephistopheles wanted the return on the pact. He requested Gort's servitude, and gave him the quest of bringing to him three sacred artifacts, the Regalia of Evil. Upon obtaining this quest, Gort was returned to the material plane, and coincidentally met a [[Drow (Dungeons & Dragons)|Drow]], named Komiyan.\n\n==Chapter summaries==\n\n'''Disciple of Fire''': The story begins with Gort's deal with Arch-Devil Mephistopheles: All the power he can want, in exchange for fetching the three artifacts of the Regalia of Evil. Meanwhile, a small drow village is under attack from a wormbeast, and Gort is summoned to deal with it.\n\n'''Wyrms and Serpents''': Gort sets out to reassemble his old team, starting with the priestess Mink, Casper, who was out hunting Slaad, and Jill.\n\n'''Rage of Winter''': The group is commissioned to fetch a monster's eye for a mystery patron.  Accepting, they travel to a snowy mountain, where they set upon a giant.\n\n'''Watcher in the Dark''': Reaching the lair of the beast whose eye they are to procure, the party discover that they are to face a Beholder, an arrogant and powerful magical creature. A difficult fight ensues, in which Mink is near-fatally injured, but the beast is felled.\n\n'''Blood Bond''': The group is nervous, having been told to take the eye to the Citadel of Light, capital of all that is good and holy on Darken, but the promise of lots of money and having Mink brought back from the brink of death spurs them on. Arriving, they find an old enemy; a priestess of the Light named Violet. They pay her, but in order to save Mink, she must create a link between the half-dragon and Gort, in order for them to share their wounds. While in the city, Gort is startled to see a man who bears a striking resemblance to himself.\n\n'''Beast''': The group is forced into doing a good deed to reclaim back their reward money- they must clear out an evil cult of blood that lives beneath the Citadel of Light. While doing so, they find the Sword of Evil, part of the Regalia, and free Michaelus, a former town guard, who promptly turns into a bear.\n\n'''Sleeping Dragons''': Travelling to Casper's old town of Falloakes, the promise of prize money and fame leads to Gort, Casper, Komiyan and Michaelus entering a race. Mink leaves, having experienced a prophetic dream advising her to awaken her blue dragon mother, Silvador, from her permanent sleep. This she does, restoring her family to the throne of Hextoria. In Falloakes, Casper is intercepted by Jade, one of the race of Yuan ti he had thought wiped out by orcs. Jade informs him of who had led the orcs that crushed the Yuan Ti.\n\n'''Siege''': Gort decides that he requires a base of operations, and picks an orc-infested castle called Three Spires. Reluctantly, the others help him lay siege to the castle, and set up a temporary home there.\n\n'''Reckoning''': Word of Gort's domination of Three Spires reaches the Citadel, and to the Paladin, Tyr, who looks so much like Gort. Outraged, he calls on the Light for help, and sets out to fight Gort atop Three Spires with the help of three celestial beings. The party are all defeated, except for Jill, who surrenders.\n\n'''Long Way Home''': Facing judgement on a celestial plane, the group is cast down into Purgatory for their various crimes, despite Tyr's insistence that they deserve only death. The limbo they are scattered in is dominated by a giant spire, which blocks all use of magic. This plane resembles [[Outlands (plane)|the Outlands]]. They are left separated without armour and weapons.\n\n'''From the Shadows''': While trying to escape the influence of the spire, Mink, Jill and Komiyan stumble across a being who claims to be an ambassador, a Shade named Zathras. Despite his terrible accent, they manage to strike a deal in which he will show them where a portal back to Darken is, and they will protect him on the way. Gort, Casper and Michaelus, however, have met a red dragon, Garganon. He helps to reunite the group and flies them to a nearby town.\n\n'''Shards''': Garganon's price for the flight is that they must retrieve a gauntlet that has been stolen from him. It has been sealed in a cave, guarded by a huge metallic five-headed beast. Along the way, Komiyan uncovers a sword that can change its form, and speaks in a voice only he can hear. After the battle with the hydra, Gort discovers that the gauntlet is, in fact, the Gauntlet of Evil, and he has no intentions of returning it to the dragon, despite the protests of the honourable Michaelus. They make good their escape in a boat, and reach the portal town, where Zathras departs for his own dimension.\n\n'''Goodnight Moon''': Komiyan returns to his hometown and faces punishment for killing a priest. Gort, as the disciple of Mephistopheles, is welcomed into the town, and the Drow priestess reveals the location of the Crown and Sword of Evil to him. Meanwhile, Casper tries to get rid of a cursed amulet that gives him nightmares.\n\n'''Reunion''': Gort pursues Tyr as the latter attempts to hide the Sword of Evil. As the two fight, a flashback is shown of their childhood. It is revealed that Gort, Tyr's brother, saved him earlier in their lives when they were captured by slavers.Gort returns to his companions with the Sword in hand, and Tyr's fate is left unknown.\n\n'''Interlude: The Devil's Due''': A brief scene in Hell, where Baal hints that he is planning something, and Mephistopheles, meanwhile, hints that he has a second disciple.\n\n'''Restless''': The group goes to the location of the Crown. As they pick their way through complicated mazes, Michaelus sets up a rebellion against Gort. Upon reaching the crown, an undead creature, actually Gort's old nemesis Leon, blocks the way. In the ensuing struggle, it is revealed that Leon is also a disciple of Mephistophiles and that he too has a remarkable power: he can possess any undead creature as his current body is destroyed. Leon escapes with the crown, Michaelus leaves the group, and the loyalties of all everyone in Gort's party is called into question.\n\n'''Afraid of the Dark''': Mink uses magic to draw the group into the Shadow plane, where they again meet Zathras and negotiate to use the plane to fight Leon. They trick Leon and Violet into fighting them on the plane, where Leon cannot regenerate. Mink takes the crown during the struggle and replaces it with a fake. Gort, having won the battle, apparently completes the Regalia.\n\n'''Uprising''': The group returns to the Three Spires to find Michaelus preparing to kill Gort before he does anything else with the Regalia. Garganon also returns, apparently sent by Mink's own mother. The dragon is winning the fight when Mink, in desperation, gives Gort the real crown, thereby completing the Regalia. It fuses to Gort's body, and with his new power he is able to destroy both Garganon and Michaelus.\n\n'''A Summer Wasting''': Several weeks later, the group meets at a bar, where Jill has an important message for all of them: \"The Worm Lord is rising.\" Everyone is surprised, as they have all heard the same phrase throughout the summer. They relate stories of how they heard the phrase, and it is revealed that the Worm Lord is the arch demon Baal. The chapter ends as Casper asks Komiyan his story, to which he responds that \"nothing happened.\" However, his story is shown to the reader, revealing that Komiyan has been captured by Baal worshipers, and that the drow seen in this chapter is actually an impostor.\n\n'''Double Down''': Gort, Mink, Jill, and the fake Komiyan go to the Citadel of Light, where Baal will shortly rise. They are slowed down as Mink and Gort are poisoned by the impostor. Meanwhile, Komiyan's sister and Shard, his sword, look for Komiyan. They free him by letting Shard possess the drow that tortured Komiyan. Casper discovers the impostor, and the group does get to the Citadel of Light before the rising. Gort meets with Tyr, who is still alive and preparing a weapon to cast Baal back into Hell. Gort is fighting a demon which is apparently the vessel Baal is preparing to possess when Komiyan, teleported from his home town, warns him that Tyr is the real vessel. A sudden explosion knocks the party off their feet, and a possessed Tyr beats Gort to the ground and leaves as more demons are pulled into the area.\n\n==Keenspot==\nIn December 2009, Kate Ashwin expressed her intention of leaving Keenspot over [[Sorcery 101|Kel McDonald's]] firing{{ref|Kel_McDonald}}.

Upon obtaining this quest, Gort was returned to the material plane, and coincidentally met a [[Drow (Dungeons & Dragons)|Drow]], named Komiyan.\n\n==Chapter summaries==\n\n'''Disciple of Fire''': The story begins with Gort's deal with Arch-Devil Mephistopheles: All the power he can want, in exchange for fetching the three artifacts of the Regalia of Evil. Meanwhile, a small drow village is under attack from a wormbeast, and Gort is summoned to deal with it.\n\n'''Wyrms and Serpents''': Gort sets out to reassemble his old team, starting with the priestess Mink, Casper, who was out hunting Slaad, and Jill.\n\n'''Rage of Winter''': The group is commissioned to fetch a monster's eye for a mystery patron.  Accepting, they travel to a snowy mountain, where they set upon a giant.\n\n'''Watcher in the Dark''': Reaching the lair of the beast whose eye they are to procure, the party discover that they are to face a Beholder, an arrogant and powerful magical creature. A difficult fight ensues, in which Mink is near-fatally injured, but the beast is felled.\n\n'''Blood Bond''': The group is nervous, having been told to take the eye to the Citadel of Light, capital of all that is good and holy on Darken, but the promise of lots of money and having Mink brought back from the brink of death spurs them on. Arriving, they find an old enemy; a priestess of the Light named Violet. They pay her, but in order to save Mink, she must create a link between the half-dragon and Gort, in order for them to share their wounds. While in the city, Gort is startled to see a man who bears a striking resemblance to himself.\n\n'''Beast''': The group is forced into doing a good deed to reclaim back their reward money- they must clear out an evil cult of blood that lives beneath the Citadel of Light. While doing so, they find the Sword of Evil, part of the Regalia, and free Michaelus, a former town guard, who promptly turns into a bear.\n\n'''Sleeping Dragons''': Travelling to Casper's old town of Falloakes, the promise of prize money and fame leads to Gort, Casper, Komiyan and Michaelus entering a race. Mink leaves, having experienced a prophetic dream advising her to awaken her blue dragon mother, Silvador, from her permanent sleep. This she does, restoring her family to the throne of Hextoria. In Falloakes, Casper is intercepted by Jade, one of the race of Yuan ti he had thought wiped out by orcs. Jade informs him of who had led the orcs that crushed the Yuan Ti.\n\n'''Siege''': Gort decides that he requires a base of operations, and picks an orc-infested castle called Three Spires. Reluctantly, the others help him lay siege to the castle, and set up a temporary home there.\n\n'''Reckoning''': Word of Gort's domination of Three Spires reaches the Citadel, and to the Paladin, Tyr, who looks so much like Gort. Outraged, he calls on the Light for help, and sets out to fight Gort atop Three Spires with the help of three celestial beings. The party are all defeated, except for Jill, who surrenders.\n\n'''Long Way Home''': Facing judgement on a celestial plane, the group is cast down into Purgatory for their various crimes, despite Tyr's insistence that they deserve only death. The limbo they are scattered in is dominated by a giant spire, which blocks all use of magic. This plane resembles [[Outlands (plane)|the Outlands]]. They are left separated without armour and weapons.\n\n'''From the Shadows''': While trying to escape the influence of the spire, Mink, Jill and Komiyan stumble across a being who claims to be an ambassador, a Shade named Zathras. Despite his terrible accent, they manage to strike a deal in which he will show them where a portal back to Darken is, and they will protect him on the way. Gort, Casper and Michaelus, however, have met a red dragon, Garganon. He helps to reunite the group and flies them to a nearby town.\n\n'''Shards''': Garganon's price for the flight is that they must retrieve a gauntlet that has been stolen from him. It has been sealed in a cave, guarded by a huge metallic five-headed beast. Along the way, Komiyan uncovers a sword that can change its form, and speaks in a voice only he can hear. After the battle with the hydra, Gort discovers that the gauntlet is, in fact, the Gauntlet of Evil, and he has no intentions of returning it to the dragon, despite the protests of the honourable Michaelus. They make good their escape in a boat, and reach the portal town, where Zathras departs for his own dimension.\n\n'''Goodnight Moon''': Komiyan returns to his hometown and faces punishment for killing a priest. Gort, as the disciple of Mephistopheles, is welcomed into the town, and the Drow priestess reveals the location of the Crown and Sword of Evil to him. Meanwhile, Casper tries to get rid of a cursed amulet that gives him nightmares.\n\n'''Reunion''': Gort pursues Tyr as the latter attempts to hide the Sword of Evil. As the two fight, a flashback is shown of their childhood. It is revealed that Gort, Tyr's brother, saved him earlier in their lives when they were captured by slavers.Gort returns to his companions with the Sword in hand, and Tyr's fate is left unknown.\n\n'''Interlude: The Devil's Due''': A brief scene in Hell, where Baal hints that he is planning something, and Mephistopheles, meanwhile, hints that he has a second disciple.\n\n'''Restless''': The group goes to the location of the Crown. As they pick their way through complicated mazes, Michaelus sets up a rebellion against Gort. Upon reaching the crown, an undead creature, actually Gort's old nemesis Leon, blocks the way. In the ensuing struggle, it is revealed that Leon is also a disciple of Mephistophiles and that he too has a remarkable power: he can possess any undead creature as his current body is destroyed. Leon escapes with the crown, Michaelus leaves the group, and the loyalties of all everyone in Gort's party is called into question.\n\n'''Afraid of the Dark''': Mink uses magic to draw the group into the Shadow plane, where they again meet Zathras and negotiate to use the plane to fight Leon. They trick Leon and Violet into fighting them on the plane, where Leon cannot regenerate. Mink takes the crown during the struggle and replaces it with a fake. Gort, having won the battle, apparently completes the Regalia.\n\n'''Uprising''': The group returns to the Three Spires to find Michaelus preparing to kill Gort before he does anything else with the Regalia. Garganon also returns, apparently sent by Mink's own mother. The dragon is winning the fight when Mink, in desperation, gives Gort the real crown, thereby completing the Regalia. It fuses to Gort's body, and with his new power he is able to destroy both Garganon and Michaelus.\n\n'''A Summer Wasting''': Several weeks later, the group meets at a bar, where Jill has an important message for all of them: \"The Worm Lord is rising.\" Everyone is surprised, as they have all heard the same phrase throughout the summer. They relate stories of how they heard the phrase, and it is revealed that the Worm Lord is the arch demon Baal. The chapter ends as Casper asks Komiyan his story, to which he responds that \"nothing happened.\" However, his story is shown to the reader, revealing that Komiyan has been captured by Baal worshipers, and that the drow seen in this chapter is actually an impostor.\n\n'''Double Down''': Gort, Mink, Jill, and the fake Komiyan go to the Citadel of Light, where Baal will shortly rise. They are slowed down as Mink and Gort are poisoned by the impostor. Meanwhile, Komiyan's sister and Shard, his sword, look for Komiyan. They free him by letting Shard possess the drow that tortured Komiyan. Casper discovers the impostor, and the group does get to the Citadel of Light before the rising. Gort meets with Tyr, who is still alive and preparing a weapon to cast Baal back into Hell. Gort is fighting a demon which is apparently the vessel Baal is preparing to possess when Komiyan, teleported from his home town, warns him that Tyr is the real vessel. A sudden explosion knocks the party off their feet, and a possessed Tyr beats Gort to the ground and leaves as more demons are pulled into the area.\n\n==Keenspot==\nIn December 2009, Kate Ashwin expressed her intention of leaving Keenspot over [[Sorcery 101|Kel McDonald's]] firing{{ref|Kel_McDonald}}.

Greater detail is known about Jeremiah's life than for that of any other prophet.\n\n[[Judaism]] considers the Book of Jeremiah part of its [[Biblical canon|canon]], and regards Jeremiah as the second of the major [[Nevi'im|prophets]]. [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]] also regard Jeremiah as a [[Prophets of Christianity|prophet]], and he is respectively quoted in the [[New Testament]]{{bibleref2c|Matthew|2:18}}{{bibleref2c|Hebrews|8:8\u201312}}{{bibleref2c-nb|Hebrews|10:16\u201317}} and his narrative is given in [[Prophets and messengers in Islam|Islamic tradition]].{{sfn|Wensinck|1913\u20131936}}\n\n== Chronology ==\n[[File:Jeremiah by Enrico Glicenstein.jpg|thumb|''Jeremiah'' by [[Enrico Glicenstein]] ]]\nJeremiah's ministry was active from the thirteenth year of [[Josiah]], [[Kingdom of Judah|king of Judah]] (626 BC{{sfn|Douglas|1987|p=559\u2013560}}), until after the [[Siege of Jerusalem (587 BC)|fall of Jerusalem]] and the destruction of [[Solomon's Temple]] in 587 BC.{{sfn|Sweeney|2004|p=917}} This period spanned the reigns of five kings of Judah: Josiah, [[Jehoahaz of Judah|Jehoahaz]], [[Jehoiakim]], [[Jehoiachin]], and [[Zedekiah]].{{sfn|Douglas|1987|p=559\u2013560}}\n\n== Biblical narrative ==\n{{Main|Book of Jeremiah}}\n\n=== Lineage and early life ===\nJeremiah was the son of [[Hilkiah]], a ''[[kohen]]'' (Jewish priest) from the Benjamite village of [[Anathoth]].{{bibleref2c|Jeremiah| 1:1}} The difficulties he encountered, as described in the books of Jeremiah and [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]], have prompted scholars to refer to him as \"the weeping prophet\".{{sfn|Henderson|2002|pp=191\u2013206}}\n\nJeremiah was called to prophetic ministry c. 626&nbsp;BC{{sfn|Longman|2008|p=6}} by [[YHWH]] to give prophecy of Jerusalem's destruction{{bibleref2c|Jeremiah|1:14-16}} that would occur by invaders from the north.{{bibleref2c|Jeremiah| 4}} This was because Israel had been unfaithful to the laws of the covenant and had forsaken God by worshiping [[Baal]].{{Bibleref2c|Jeremiah|2}}{{Bibleref2c-nb|Jeremiah|3}}{{Bibleref2c-nb|Jeremiah |5}}{{Bibleref2c-nb|Jeremiah |9}} Jeremiah condemned people burning their children as offerings to [[Moloch]].{{Bibleref2c|Jeremiah|19:4\u20135|NIV}} This nation had deviated so far from God that they had broken the covenant, causing God to withdraw his blessings. Jeremiah was guided by God to proclaim that the nation of Judah would be faced with famine, plundered and taken captive by foreigners who would exile them to a foreign land.{{Bibleref2c|Jeremiah |10}}{{Bibleref2c-nb|Jeremiah |11}}\n\nThe prophetess [[Huldah]] was a relative and contemporary of Jeremiah while the prophet [[Zephaniah]] was his mentor.{{sfn|Singer|1926|p=100}}\n\n=== Calling ===\n[[File:SA 160-Jeremia op de puinhopen van Jeruzalem.jpg|thumb|left|[[Horace Vernet]], ''Jeremiah on the ruins of Jerusalem'' (1844)]]\nAccording to [[Jeremiah 1#Verse 2|Jeremiah 1:2]][[Jeremiah 1#Verse 3|\u20133]], [[Yahweh]] called Jeremiah to prophetic ministry in about 626&nbsp;BC,{{sfn|Longman|2008|p=6}} about five years before Josiah king of Judah turned the nation toward repentance from idolatrous practices.{{bibleref2c|2 Kings|22:3-13|KJV}} According to the [[Books of Kings]], and Jeremiah, Josiah's reforms were insufficient to save Judah and Jerusalem from destruction, because of the sins of [[Manasseh of Judah|Manasseh]], Josiah's grandfather,{{bibleref2c|2 Kings|23:26\u201327|KJV}} and Judah's return to idolatry{{bibleref2c|Jeremiah |11:10}} Such was the lust of the nation for false gods that after Josiah's death, the nation would quickly return to the gods of the surrounding nations.{{bibleref2c|2 Kings|23:32|KJV}} Jeremiah was said to have been appointed to reveal the sins of the people and the coming consequences.{{bibleref2c|Jeremiah|1:1-2:37}}{{sfn|Ryken|2001|p=19-36}}\n\nJeremiah resisted the call by complaining that he was only a child and did not know how to speak.{{sfn|Freedman|1992|p=686}} However, the Lord insisted that Jeremiah go and speak, and he touched Jeremiah's mouth to place the word of the Lord there.{{bibleref2c|Jeremiah|1:6\u20139|KJV}} God told Jeremiah to \"Get yourself ready!\"{{bibleref2c|Jeremiah |1:17| NIV}} The character traits and practices Jeremiah was to acquire are specified in [[Jeremiah 1]] and include not being afraid, standing up to speak, speaking as told, and going where sent.{{bibleref2c|Jeremiah|1:4\u201310|KJV}}{{bibleref2c|Jeremiah|1:17\u201319|KJV}} Since Jeremiah is described as emerging well trained and fully literate from his earliest preaching, the relationship between him and the [[Shaphan]] family has been used to suggest that he may have trained at the scribal school in Jerusalem over which Shaphan presided.{{bibleref2c|2 Kings|22:8\u201310|KJV}}{{sfn|Freedman|1992|p=687}}\n\nIn his early ministry, Jeremiah was primarily a preaching prophet,{{bibleref2c|Jeremiah |1:7}} preaching throughout Israel.{{sfn|Freedman|1992|p=687}} He condemned idolatry,{{bibleref2c|Jeremiah|3:12\u201323|KJV}},{{bibleref2c|Jeremiah|4:1\u20134|KJV}} the greed of priests, and false prophets.{{bibleref2c|Jeremiah|6:13\u201314|KJV}}. Many years later, God instructed Jeremiah to write down these early oracles and his other messages.{{bibleref2c|Jeremiah|36:1\u201310|KJV}}\n\n=== Persecution ===\n[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn - Jeremia treurend over de verwoesting van Jeruzalem - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|[[Rembrandt van Rijn]], ''Jeremiah Lamenting the Destruction of Jerusalem'', c. 1630]]\n\nJeremiah's ministry prompted plots against him.{{bibleref2c|Jeremiah|11:21\u201323|KJV}} Unhappy with Jeremiah's message, possibly for concern that it would shut down the Anathoth sanctuary, his priestly kin and the men of Anathoth conspired to kill him. However, the Lord revealed the conspiracy to Jeremiah, protected his life, and declared disaster for the men of Anathoth.{{sfn|Freedman|1992|p=687}}{{bibleref2c|Jeremiah|11:18\u20132:6|KJV}} When Jeremiah complains to the Lord about this persecution, he is told that the attacks on him will become worse.{{sfn|Sweeney|2004|p=950}}\n\nA priest [[Pashur]] the son of [[Immer|ben Immer]], a temple official in Jerusalem, had Jeremiah beaten and put in the stocks at the Upper Gate of Benjamin for a day. After this, Jeremiah expresses lament over the difficulty that speaking God's word has caused him and regrets becoming a laughingstock and the target of mockery.{{bibleref2c|Jeremiah|20:7|KJV}} He recounts how if he tries to shut the word of the Lord inside and not mention God's name, the word becomes like fire in his heart and he is unable to hold it in.{{bibleref2c|Jeremiah|20:9|KJV}}\n\n=== Conflicts with false prophets ===\nWhilst Jeremiah was prophesying the coming destruction, a number of other prophets were prophesying peace.{{bibleref2c|Jeremiah|6:13\u201315|KJV}}{{bibleref2c-nb|Jeremiah|14:14\u201316|KJV}}{{bibleref2c-nb|Jeremiah|23:9\u201340|KJV}}{{bibleref2c-nb|Jeremiah| 27:1-28:17}}{{bibleref2c-nb|Lamentations|2:14|KJV}} Jeremiah spoke against these other prophets.\n\nAccording to the book of Jeremiah, during the reign of King Zedekiah, The Lord instructed Jeremiah to make a yoke of the message that the nation would be subject to the king of Babylon. The prophet Hananiah opposed Jeremiah's message. He took the yoke off Jeremiah's neck, broke it, and prophesied to the priests and all the people that within two years the Lord would break the yoke of the king of Babylon, but the Lord spoke to Jeremiah saying \"Go and speak to Hananiah saying, you have broken the yoke of wood, but you have made instead a yoke of iron.\"{{bibleref2c|Jeremiah|28:13|KJV}}\n\n=== Relationship with the Northern Kingdom (Samaria) ===\nJeremiah was sympathetic to, as well as descended from, the Northern Kingdom. Many of his first reported oracles are about, and addressed to, the Israelites at Samaria. He resembles the northern prophet Hosea, in his use of language, and examples of God's relationship to Israel. Hosea seems to have been the first prophet to describe the desired relationship as an example of ancient Israelite marriage, where a man might be polygynous, while a woman was only permitted one husband. Jeremiah often repeats Hosea's marital imagery.{{bibleref2c|Jeremiah|2:2}}{{bibleref2c-nb|Jeremiah|2:3|KJV}}{{bibleref2c-nb|Jeremiah|3:1\u20135|KJV}}{{bibleref2c-nb|Jeremiah|3:19\u201325|KJV}}{{bibleref2c-nb|Jeremiah|4:1\u20132|KJV}}{{sfn|Anon.|1971|p=126}}\n\n=== Babylon ===\nThe Biblical narrative portrays Jeremiah as being subject to additional persecutions. After Jeremiah prophesied that Jerusalem would be handed over to the Babylonian army, the king's officials, including Pashur the priest, tried to convince King Zedekiah that Jeremiah should be put to death because he was discouraging the soldiers as well as the people. Zedekiah answered that he would not oppose them. Consequently, the king's officials took Jeremiah and put him down into a [[cistern]], where he sank down into the mud. The intent seemed to be to kill Jeremiah by allowing him to starve to death in a manner designed to allow the officials to claim to be innocent of his blood.{{sfn|Barker| Youngblood|Stek|1995|p=1544}}  A Cushite rescued Jeremiah by pulling him out of the cistern, but Jeremiah remained imprisoned until Jerusalem fell to the Babylonian army in 587&nbsp;BC.{{bibleref2c|Jeremiah| 38}}\n\nThe Babylonians released Jeremiah, and showed him great kindness, allowing Jeremiah to choose the place of his residence, according to a Babylonian edict. Jeremiah accordingly went to [[Mizpah in Benjamin]] with [[Gedaliah]], who had been made governor of [[Judea]].{{bibleref2c|Jeremiah|40:5-6|KJV}}\n\n=== Egypt ===\n[[Johanan]] succeeded [[Gedaliah]], who had been assassinated by an Israelite prince in the pay of [[Ammon]] \"for working with the Babylonians.\" Refusing to listen to Jeremiah's counsel, Johanan fled to Egypt, taking with him Jeremiah and [[Baruch ben Neriah|Baruch]], Jeremiah's faithful [[scribe]] and servant, and the king's daughters.{{bibleref2c|Jeremiah|43:1-13|KJV}} There, the prophet probably spent the remainder of his life, still seeking in vain to turn the people to God from whom they had so long revolted.{{bibleref2c|Jeremiah|43:1-13|KJV}} There is no authentic record of his death.\n\n== Religious views ==\n=== Judaism ===\nIn Jewish [[rabbinic literature]], especially the [[aggadah]], Jeremiah and [[Moses]] are often mentioned together;<ref>This article incorporates text from the 1901\u20131906 ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'', a publication now in the [[public domain]].</ref> their life and works being presented in parallel lines. The following ancient [[midrash]] is especially interesting, in connection with {{bibleverse|Deuteronomy|18:18|HE}}, in which \"a prophet like Moses\" is promised: \"As Moses was a prophet for forty years, so was Jeremiah; as Moses prophesied concerning Judah and Benjamin, so did Jeremiah; as Moses' own tribe [the Levites under Korah] rose up against him, so did Jeremiah's tribe revolt against him; Moses was cast into the water, Jeremiah into a pit; as Moses was saved by a slave (the slave of [[Pharaoh]]'s daughter); so, Jeremiah was rescued by a slave ([[Ebed-melech]]); Moses reprimanded the people in discourses; so did Jeremiah.\"<ref>[[Pesiqta de-Rav Kahana|Pesiqta]], ed.

There are about forty direct quotations of the book in the New Testament, most in Revelation in connection with the destruction of Babylon.{{sfn|Dillard|Longman|1994|p=339}}\n*{{bibleref2|Jeremiah|50:8|KJV}} in {{bibleref2|Revelation|18:4|KJV}}\n*{{bibleref2|Jeremiah|50:32|KJV}} in {{bibleref2|Revelation|18:8|KJV}};\n*{{bibleref2|Jeremiah|51:49-50|KJV}} in {{bibleref2|Revelation|18:24|KJV}}\n\nOf the Gospel writers, [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] is especially mindful of how the events in the life, death and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth fulfill Jeremianic prophecies.{{bibleref2c|Matthew |2:17}}{{bibleref2c-nb|Matthew |27:9-10}} The writer to the [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]] also picks up the fulfilment of the prophetic expectation of the new covenant.{{bibleref2c|Hebrews|8:8-12|KJV}}{{bibleref2c-nb|Hebrews|10:16-17|KJV}})\n\n=== Islam ===\n[[File:Jonah and the fish Jeremiah in wilderness Uzeyr awakened after the destruction of Jerusalem.JPG|thumb|Jeremiah in the wilderness (top left); Jonah and the fish; Uzeyr awakened after the destruction of Jerusalem. Ottoman Turkish miniature, 16th century.{{sfn|Renda|1978}}]]\nAs with many other prophets of the [[Hebrew]] [[Bible]], Jeremiah is also regarded as a [[prophet]] in [[Islam]]. Although Jeremiah is not mentioned in the [[Quran]], [[Exegesis#Islam|Muslim exegesis]] and [[literature]] narrates many instances from the life of Jeremiah and fleshes out his narrative, which closely corresponds with the account given in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. In Arabic, Jeremiah's name is usually vocalised ''Irmiy\u0101'', ''Armiy\u0101'' or ''\u016armiy\u0101'',<ref>see ''T\u0101d\u0332j\u0332 al-\u02bfAr\u016bs'', x. 157.</ref>.<!-- and these forms are occasionally given with madd also (''Irmiy\u0101\u02be'').---- Comment this back in once you clarify what \"madd\" means. --> Classical historians such as [[Wahb ibn Munabbih]] gave accounts of Jeremiah which turned \"upon the main points of the Old Testament story of Jeremiah: his call to be a prophet, his mission to the king of Judah, his mission to the people and his reluctance, the announcement of a foreign tyrant who is to rule over Judah.\"{{sfn|Wensinck|1913\u20131936}} Moreover, some [[hadith]]s and [[tafsir]]s narrate that the [[Parable of the Hamlet in Ruins]] is about Jeremiah.<ref>''Tafsir al-Qurtubi'', vol. 3, p. 188; ''Tafsir al-Qummi'', vol. 1, p. 117.</ref> Also, in [[Sura]] 17([[Al-Isra]]), [[Ayah]] 4\u20137, that is about the two corruptions of [[Israelites|children of Israel]] on the earth, some hadith and tafsir cite that one of these corruptions is the imprisonment and persecution of Jeremiah.\n\n[[Muslim]] [[literature]] narrates a detailed account of the [[destruction of Jerusalem]], which parallels the account given in the [[Book of Jeremiah]].<ref>''Tabari'', i, 646ff.</ref>\n\n==Historicity==\nThe consensus seems to be that there was a historical prophet named Jeremiah and that portions of the book probably were written by Jeremiah and/or his scribe Baruch. However it also went through several extensive redactions in the exilic and post-exilic periods which added material and altered the wording of oracles. This resulted in variant editions of the book ([[Septuagint]], 4QJer, MT). Sometimes it is clear that the Septuagint reflects the earlier wording, such as in Jeremiah 25:8-12.\n\nViews range from the belief that the narratives and poetic sections in Jeremiah are contemporary with his life (W.L. Holladay), to the view that the work of the original prophet is beyond identification or recovery(R. P. Carroll).{{sfn|Anon.|1971|p=125}}<ref name=\"HOW \u05d5\u05d1\u05bc\u05e9 \u05c1AND \u05dd\u05b7\u05d7\u05b8\u05e0 CONTRIBUTE TO UNDERSTANDING THE MEANING OF JEREMIAH 4:28, 15:6-7, 18:7-10 AND 26:3, 13 AND 19\">{{cite web |last1=Marsh |first1=Allen Bythel |url=https://www.sats.edu.za/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Thesis_PhD_2018_MarshA.pdf |accessdate=7 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nSee the extensive analysis in Rainer Albertz' Israel in Exile (2003, SBL), pp. 302-344<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xx9YzJq2B9wC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Rainer+Albertz'+Israel+in+Exile+(2003&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjjxommndfoAhXQJjQIHV_WB0sQ6AEwAHoECAIQAg#v=onepage&q=Rainer+Albertz'+Israel+in+Exile+(2003&f=false|title=Israel in Exile: The History and Literature of the Sixth Century B.C.E.|first=Rainer|last=Albertz|date=April 10, 2003|publisher=Society of Biblical Lit|via=Google Books}}</ref>. First there were early collections of oracles, including material in ch. 2-6, 8-10, 13, 21-23, etc. Then there was an early [[Deuteronomist|Deuteronomistic]] redaction which Albertz dates to around 550 BC, with the original ending to the book at 25:13. There was a second redaction around 545-540 BC which added much more material, up to about ch. 45. Then there was a third redaction around 525-520 BC, expanding the book up to the ending at 51:64. Then there were further post-exilic redactions adding ch. 52 and editing content throughout the book.\n\nAlthough Jeremiah was often thought of traditionally as the author of the [[Book of Lamentations]], this is probably a collection of individual and communal laments composed at various times throughout the [[Babylonian captivity]]. Albertz considers ch. 2 as the oldest, dating shortly after the [[Siege of Jerusalem (587 BC)|Siege of Jerusalem]] (587 BC) and ch. 5 after the assassination of [[Gedaliah]], with the other chapters added later (p. 160).\n\n== Scholarly views ==\nScholars cannot prove the authorship of Jeremiah with any certainty, although consensus has gathered around a thesis of multiple sources, mainly because of the contrast between the poetic discourses and the prose narrative. Some modern scholars think the [[Deuteronomist]] edited Jeremiah because of the similarity of phrasing between the books of Jeremiah and Deuteronomy. For example, Egypt is referred to as an \"iron furnace\" in both {{bibleref2|Jeremiah |11:4}} and {{bibleref2|Deuteronomy|4:20|KJV}}.{{sfn|Coogan|2012|p=300}}  They also share a similar view of divine justice.{{sfn|Coogan|2012|p=300}}\n\n[[Emanuel Tov]] believes that the [[Septuagint]] version of Jeremiah is earlier, and the [[Masoretic Text]] version is a later, longer version.{{sfn|Sweeney|2016|p=456}}\n\n==Archaeology==\n===Nebo-Sarsekim tablet===\nIn July 2007, Assyrologist Michael Jursa translated a [[cuneiform]] tablet dated to 595&nbsp;BC, as describing a Nabusharrussu-ukin as \"the chief [[eunuch]]\" of [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] of [[Babylon]].

After this, Jeremiah expresses lament over the difficulty that speaking God's word has caused him and regrets becoming a laughingstock and the target of mockery.{{bibleref2c|Jeremiah|20:7|KJV}} He recounts how if he tries to shut the word of the Lord inside and not mention God's name, the word becomes like fire in his heart and he is unable to hold it in.{{bibleref2c|Jeremiah|20:9|KJV}}\n\n=== Conflicts with false prophets ===\nWhilst Jeremiah was prophesying the coming destruction, a number of other prophets were prophesying peace.{{bibleref2c|Jeremiah|6:13\u201315|KJV}}{{bibleref2c-nb|Jeremiah|14:14\u201316|KJV}}{{bibleref2c-nb|Jeremiah|23:9\u201340|KJV}}{{bibleref2c-nb|Jeremiah| 27:1-28:17}}{{bibleref2c-nb|Lamentations|2:14|KJV}} Jeremiah spoke against these other prophets.\n\nAccording to the book of Jeremiah, during the reign of King Zedekiah, The Lord instructed Jeremiah to make a yoke of the message that the nation would be subject to the king of Babylon. The prophet Hananiah opposed Jeremiah's message. He took the yoke off Jeremiah's neck, broke it, and prophesied to the priests and all the people that within two years the Lord would break the yoke of the king of Babylon, but the Lord spoke to Jeremiah saying \"Go and speak to Hananiah saying, you have broken the yoke of wood, but you have made instead a yoke of iron.\"{{bibleref2c|Jeremiah|28:13|KJV}}\n\n=== Relationship with the Northern Kingdom (Samaria) ===\nJeremiah was sympathetic to, as well as descended from, the Northern Kingdom. Many of his first reported oracles are about, and addressed to, the Israelites at Samaria. He resembles the northern prophet Hosea, in his use of language, and examples of God's relationship to Israel. Hosea seems to have been the first prophet to describe the desired relationship as an example of ancient Israelite marriage, where a man might be polygynous, while a woman was only permitted one husband. Jeremiah often repeats Hosea's marital imagery.{{bibleref2c|Jeremiah|2:2}}{{bibleref2c-nb|Jeremiah|2:3|KJV}}{{bibleref2c-nb|Jeremiah|3:1\u20135|KJV}}{{bibleref2c-nb|Jeremiah|3:19\u201325|KJV}}{{bibleref2c-nb|Jeremiah|4:1\u20132|KJV}}{{sfn|Anon.|1971|p=126}}\n\n=== Babylon ===\nThe Biblical narrative portrays Jeremiah as being subject to additional persecutions. After Jeremiah prophesied that Jerusalem would be handed over to the Babylonian army, the king's officials, including Pashur the priest, tried to convince King Zedekiah that Jeremiah should be put to death because he was discouraging the soldiers as well as the people. Zedekiah answered that he would not oppose them. Consequently, the king's officials took Jeremiah and put him down into a [[cistern]], where he sank down into the mud. The intent seemed to be to kill Jeremiah by allowing him to starve to death in a manner designed to allow the officials to claim to be innocent of his blood.{{sfn|Barker| Youngblood|Stek|1995|p=1544}}  A Cushite rescued Jeremiah by pulling him out of the cistern, but Jeremiah remained imprisoned until Jerusalem fell to the Babylonian army in 587&nbsp;BC.{{bibleref2c|Jeremiah| 38}}\n\nThe Babylonians released Jeremiah, and showed him great kindness, allowing Jeremiah to choose the place of his residence, according to a Babylonian edict. Jeremiah accordingly went to [[Mizpah in Benjamin]] with [[Gedaliah]], who had been made governor of [[Judea]].{{bibleref2c|Jeremiah|40:5-6|KJV}}\n\n=== Egypt ===\n[[Johanan]] succeeded [[Gedaliah]], who had been assassinated by an Israelite prince in the pay of [[Ammon]] \"for working with the Babylonians.\" Refusing to listen to Jeremiah's counsel, Johanan fled to Egypt, taking with him Jeremiah and [[Baruch ben Neriah|Baruch]], Jeremiah's faithful [[scribe]] and servant, and the king's daughters.{{bibleref2c|Jeremiah|43:1-13|KJV}} There, the prophet probably spent the remainder of his life, still seeking in vain to turn the people to God from whom they had so long revolted.{{bibleref2c|Jeremiah|43:1-13|KJV}} There is no authentic record of his death.\n\n== Religious views ==\n=== Judaism ===\nIn Jewish [[rabbinic literature]], especially the [[aggadah]], Jeremiah and [[Moses]] are often mentioned together;<ref>This article incorporates text from the 1901\u20131906 ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'', a publication now in the [[public domain]].</ref> their life and works being presented in parallel lines. The following ancient [[midrash]] is especially interesting, in connection with {{bibleverse|Deuteronomy|18:18|HE}}, in which \"a prophet like Moses\" is promised: \"As Moses was a prophet for forty years, so was Jeremiah; as Moses prophesied concerning Judah and Benjamin, so did Jeremiah; as Moses' own tribe [the Levites under Korah] rose up against him, so did Jeremiah's tribe revolt against him; Moses was cast into the water, Jeremiah into a pit; as Moses was saved by a slave (the slave of [[Pharaoh]]'s daughter); so, Jeremiah was rescued by a slave ([[Ebed-melech]]); Moses reprimanded the people in discourses; so did Jeremiah.\"<ref>[[Pesiqta de-Rav Kahana|Pesiqta]], ed.

There are about forty direct quotations of the book in the New Testament, most in Revelation in connection with the destruction of Babylon.{{sfn|Dillard|Longman|1994|p=339}}\n*{{bibleref2|Jeremiah|50:8|KJV}} in {{bibleref2|Revelation|18:4|KJV}}\n*{{bibleref2|Jeremiah|50:32|KJV}} in {{bibleref2|Revelation|18:8|KJV}};\n*{{bibleref2|Jeremiah|51:49-50|KJV}} in {{bibleref2|Revelation|18:24|KJV}}\n\nOf the Gospel writers, [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] is especially mindful of how the events in the life, death and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth fulfill Jeremianic prophecies.{{bibleref2c|Matthew |2:17}}{{bibleref2c-nb|Matthew |27:9-10}} The writer to the [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]] also picks up the fulfilment of the prophetic expectation of the new covenant.{{bibleref2c|Hebrews|8:8-12|KJV}}{{bibleref2c-nb|Hebrews|10:16-17|KJV}})\n\n=== Islam ===\n[[File:Jonah and the fish Jeremiah in wilderness Uzeyr awakened after the destruction of Jerusalem.JPG|thumb|Jeremiah in the wilderness (top left); Jonah and the fish; Uzeyr awakened after the destruction of Jerusalem. Ottoman Turkish miniature, 16th century.{{sfn|Renda|1978}}]]\nAs with many other prophets of the [[Hebrew]] [[Bible]], Jeremiah is also regarded as a [[prophet]] in [[Islam]]. Although Jeremiah is not mentioned in the [[Quran]], [[Exegesis#Islam|Muslim exegesis]] and [[literature]] narrates many instances from the life of Jeremiah and fleshes out his narrative, which closely corresponds with the account given in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. In Arabic, Jeremiah's name is usually vocalised ''Irmiy\u0101'', ''Armiy\u0101'' or ''\u016armiy\u0101'',<ref>see ''T\u0101d\u0332j\u0332 al-\u02bfAr\u016bs'', x. 157.</ref>.<!-- and these forms are occasionally given with madd also (''Irmiy\u0101\u02be'').---- Comment this back in once you clarify what \"madd\" means. --> Classical historians such as [[Wahb ibn Munabbih]] gave accounts of Jeremiah which turned \"upon the main points of the Old Testament story of Jeremiah: his call to be a prophet, his mission to the king of Judah, his mission to the people and his reluctance, the announcement of a foreign tyrant who is to rule over Judah.\"{{sfn|Wensinck|1913\u20131936}} Moreover, some [[hadith]]s and [[tafsir]]s narrate that the [[Parable of the Hamlet in Ruins]] is about Jeremiah.<ref>''Tafsir al-Qurtubi'', vol. 3, p. 188; ''Tafsir al-Qummi'', vol. 1, p. 117.</ref> Also, in [[Sura]] 17([[Al-Isra]]), [[Ayah]] 4\u20137, that is about the two corruptions of [[Israelites|children of Israel]] on the earth, some hadith and tafsir cite that one of these corruptions is the imprisonment and persecution of Jeremiah.\n\n[[Muslim]] [[literature]] narrates a detailed account of the [[destruction of Jerusalem]], which parallels the account given in the [[Book of Jeremiah]].<ref>''Tabari'', i, 646ff.</ref>\n\n==Historicity==\nThe consensus seems to be that there was a historical prophet named Jeremiah and that portions of the book probably were written by Jeremiah and/or his scribe Baruch. However it also went through several extensive redactions in the exilic and post-exilic periods which added material and altered the wording of oracles. This resulted in variant editions of the book ([[Septuagint]], 4QJer, MT). Sometimes it is clear that the Septuagint reflects the earlier wording, such as in Jeremiah 25:8-12.\n\nViews range from the belief that the narratives and poetic sections in Jeremiah are contemporary with his life (W.L. Holladay), to the view that the work of the original prophet is beyond identification or recovery(R. P. Carroll).{{sfn|Anon.|1971|p=125}}<ref name=\"HOW \u05d5\u05d1\u05bc\u05e9 \u05c1AND \u05dd\u05b7\u05d7\u05b8\u05e0 CONTRIBUTE TO UNDERSTANDING THE MEANING OF JEREMIAH 4:28, 15:6-7, 18:7-10 AND 26:3, 13 AND 19\">{{cite web |last1=Marsh |first1=Allen Bythel |url=https://www.sats.edu.za/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Thesis_PhD_2018_MarshA.pdf |accessdate=7 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nSee the extensive analysis in Rainer Albertz' Israel in Exile (2003, SBL), pp. 302-344<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xx9YzJq2B9wC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Rainer+Albertz'+Israel+in+Exile+(2003&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjjxommndfoAhXQJjQIHV_WB0sQ6AEwAHoECAIQAg#v=onepage&q=Rainer+Albertz'+Israel+in+Exile+(2003&f=false|title=Israel in Exile: The History and Literature of the Sixth Century B.C.E.|first=Rainer|last=Albertz|date=April 10, 2003|publisher=Society of Biblical Lit|via=Google Books}}</ref>. First there were early collections of oracles, including material in ch. 2-6, 8-10, 13, 21-23, etc. Then there was an early [[Deuteronomist|Deuteronomistic]] redaction which Albertz dates to around 550 BC, with the original ending to the book at 25:13. There was a second redaction around 545-540 BC which added much more material, up to about ch. 45. Then there was a third redaction around 525-520 BC, expanding the book up to the ending at 51:64. Then there were further post-exilic redactions adding ch. 52 and editing content throughout the book.\n\nAlthough Jeremiah was often thought of traditionally as the author of the [[Book of Lamentations]], this is probably a collection of individual and communal laments composed at various times throughout the [[Babylonian captivity]]. Albertz considers ch. 2 as the oldest, dating shortly after the [[Siege of Jerusalem (587 BC)|Siege of Jerusalem]] (587 BC) and ch. 5 after the assassination of [[Gedaliah]], with the other chapters added later (p. 160).\n\n== Scholarly views ==\nScholars cannot prove the authorship of Jeremiah with any certainty, although consensus has gathered around a thesis of multiple sources, mainly because of the contrast between the poetic discourses and the prose narrative. Some modern scholars think the [[Deuteronomist]] edited Jeremiah because of the similarity of phrasing between the books of Jeremiah and Deuteronomy. For example, Egypt is referred to as an \"iron furnace\" in both {{bibleref2|Jeremiah |11:4}} and {{bibleref2|Deuteronomy|4:20|KJV}}.{{sfn|Coogan|2012|p=300}}  They also share a similar view of divine justice.{{sfn|Coogan|2012|p=300}}\n\n[[Emanuel Tov]] believes that the [[Septuagint]] version of Jeremiah is earlier, and the [[Masoretic Text]] version is a later, longer version.{{sfn|Sweeney|2016|p=456}}\n\n==Archaeology==\n===Nebo-Sarsekim tablet===\nIn July 2007, Assyrologist Michael Jursa translated a [[cuneiform]] tablet dated to 595&nbsp;BC, as describing a Nabusharrussu-ukin as \"the chief [[eunuch]]\" of [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] of [[Babylon]]. Jursa hypothesized that this reference might be to the same individual as the [[Nebo-Sarsekim Tablet|Nebo-Sarsekim]] mentioned in {{bibleref2|Jeremiah|39:3}}.{{sfn|Reynolds|2007}}{{sfn|Hobbins|2007}}\n\n===Seals===\nA 7th-century BCE [[Jehucal|seal of Jehucal, son of Shelemiah]] and another of [[Gedaliah, son of Pashhur]] (mentioned together in [[Jeremiah 38:1]]; Jehucal also mentioned in [[Jeremiah 37:3]]) were found during excavation by [[Eilat Mazar]] in the [[city of David]], [[Jerusalem]], in 2005 and 2008, respectively.{{sfn|Kantrowitz|2012}}\n===Tel Arad ostraca===\nPottery shards at [[Tel Arad]] were  unearthed in the 1970s that mention [[Pashhur]], and this reference may be the same individual mentioned in {{bibleref2|Jeremiah |20:1}}<ref name=\"mfa.gov.il\" />\n\n== Cultural influence ==\nJeremiah inspired the [[French language|French]] noun ''j\u00e9r\u00e9miade'', and subsequently the [[English language|English]] ''jeremiad'', meaning \"a lamentation; mournful complaint,\"{{sfn|Anon.|1989|p=766}}} or further, \"a cautionary or angry harangue.\"<ref name=\"merriam-webster.com\" />\n\nJeremiah has periodically been a popular first name in the [[United States]], beginning with the early [[Puritan]] settlers, who often took the names of biblical prophets and apostles.
