{"title_page": "PfSPZ Vaccine", "text_new": "'''PfSPZ Vaccine''' is a candidate [[malaria vaccine]] made of non-replicating irradiated whole [[sporozoite]]s and developed by [[Sanaria]]. PfSPZ is the acronym of words: ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'' (Pf) and [[sporozoite]]s (SPZ). Clinical trials have been promising, but it has been subject to some criticism regarding its ultimate feasibility with regard to large-scale production and delivery in Africa, since it must be stored in super-cold liquid nitrogen.\n\n== History ==\nIn the first half of the 20th century there were first attempts to protect people from [[malaria]]. At the beginning Pasteur's approach of developing bacterial vaccines was used as a big hope in eradication of this fatal disease. But inactivated malaria sporozoites (by formalin) were ineffective in inducing the protection.\n\nIn 1948 inactivated merozoites with an adjuvant were used for preventing lethal malaria to kill a group of monkeys. But the strong toxicity of the adjuvant and inability to obtain sufficient count of parasites from human blood stopped further efforts in this way.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=18898694|year=1948|last1=Freund|first1=J|title=Immunization of monkeys against malaria by means of killed parasites with adjuvants|journal=The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene|volume=28|issue=1|pages=1\u201322|last2=Thomson|first2=K. J.|doi=10.4269/ajtmh.1948.s1-28.1}}</ref>\n\nIn 1967 irradiated malaria sporozoites (extracted from salivary glands of infected [[Anopheles|mosquitos]]) induced immune response in mice without the need of the adjuvant and similar evidence obtained in human volunteer trials. The mice were exposed to irradiated mosquitos infected by malaria parasites. Mice and volunteers did not acquire malaria because mosquitos and the sporozoites were irradiated and their immune cells triggered response that could protect them from following infection.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=6057225|year=1967|last1=Nussenzweig|first1=R.

Today, a vaccine called [[RTS,S]] based on coat protein of sporozoites of the ''Plasmodium falciparum'' is the most advanced subunit vaccine and is in the phase III clinical trials. It protects about 50% of subjects infected by controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) after 2 \u2013 3 weeks and about 23% at 5 months after last immunization.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=19569965|year=2009|last1=Kester|first1=K.

PfSPZ is the acronym of words: ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'' (Pf) and [[sporozoite]]s (SPZ). Clinical trials have been promising, but it has been subject to some criticism regarding its ultimate feasibility with regard to large-scale production and delivery in Africa, since it must be stored in super-cold liquid nitrogen.\n\n== History ==\nIn the first half of the 20th century there were first attempts to protect people from [[malaria]]. At the beginning Pasteur\u00b4s approach of developing bacterial vaccines was used as a big hope in eradication of this fatal disease. But inactivated malaria sporozoites (by formalin) were ineffective in inducing the protection.\n\nIn 1948 inactivated merozoites with an adjuvant were used for preventing lethal malaria to kill a group of monkeys. But the strong toxicity of the adjuvant and inability to obtain sufficient count of parasites from human blood stopped further efforts in this way.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=18898694|year=1948|last1=Freund|first1=J|title=Immunization of monkeys against malaria by means of killed parasites with adjuvants|journal=The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene|volume=28|issue=1|pages=1\u201322|last2=Thomson|first2=K.

The mice were exposed to irradiated mosquitos infected by malaria parasites. Mice and volunteers did not acquire malaria because mosquitos and the sporozoites were irradiated and their immune cells triggered response that could protect them from following infection.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=6057225|year=1967|last1=Nussenzweig|first1=R.

Today, a vaccine called [[RTS,S]] based on coat protein of sporozoites of the ''Plasmodium falciparum'' is the most advanced subunit vaccine and is in the phase III clinical trials.

{"title_page": "Evolution of Management Systems", "text_new": "{{Orphan|date=December 2015}}\n\n''''A [[management system]] is the framework of processes and procedures used to ensure that an organization can fulfill all tasks required to achieve its objectives.\n\nAfter World War II, the reigning paradigm of product-oriented mass production had reached its peak. Examples of management systems at that time are [[Assembly lines|linear assembly lines]], organizational hierarchies of command, [[Quality control|product quality control]] and mass consumption.\n\nSoon afterwards, the [[W. Edwards Deming|Deming]]-[[Joseph M. Juran|Juran]] process-quality teachings spearheaded a new quality orientation (later referred to as [[Total quality management]]) and propelled Japan directly to the post-war process focus (process quality control, [[Just in time (business)|just-in-time]], continuous improvement).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2004-08-29/deming-and-juran-the-kings-of-quality | title=Deming And Juran: The Kings Of Quality | publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek | date=August 2004}}</ref>  The US responded by a painful and prolonged product-to-process transformation, ultimately leveling the playing field again by the mid 1980s.\n\nAt the end of the 1980s, [[business process reengineering]] focused on the radical redesign of the production process through the reintegration of task, labor and knowledge. As a result, lean, flexible and streamlined production processes were created, capable of fast response and internet-based integration necessary for the upcoming phase of supply chains - [[business-to-business]] (B2B) \u2013 as well as demand chains \u2013 [[Consumer-to-business|business-to-customer]] (B2C).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/in-business/advice/18436/the-evolution-of-management/ | title=The Evolution of Management | publisher=Business Matters | year=May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.strategicleadershipinstitute.net/news/the-historical-evolution-of-management-theory-from-1900-to-present-the-changing-role-of-leaders-in-organizations-/ | title=The Historical Evolution of Management Theory from 1900 to Present: The Changing role of Leaders in Organizations | publisher=Strategic Leadership Institute | last=Bosman | first=Manie | year=January 2009}}</ref>  \n\t\nIn the above three stages of '''Evolution of Management Systems''', the competitive advantage was derived almost exclusively from the internal resources of the firm. At the end of the 1980s, a radical fourth shift has occurred: the competitive advantage became increasingly derived from the external resources of the firm \u2013 through the extended networks of suppliers and customers.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=4&sid=f425a546-b334-4aff-a38e-a48ccc251d39%40sessionmgr4005&hid=4108 | title=THE EVOLUTION OF MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS | date=March 1970 | last=Ackoff | first=Russell L. | journal=CORS Journal | volume=8 | issue=1 | page=P 1\u201313 | issn=0574-9638}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Figure 1 Basic scheme product, process, external networks.PNG|thumb|'''Figure 1 Basic scheme: product, process, external networks'''|533x533px]]\nFigure 1 refers to the basic scheme of production and service delivery process. It represents the traditional linear input-process-output management system. This system has been fixed and unchanging for centuries. The only change has been in terms of changing focus on individual components of the system, emphasizing different parts of this basic scheme.\n\nAlthough the scheme itself (inputs \u2192 process \u2192 outputs) remains mostly unchallenged, there are some indications that this business model will undergo major restructurings in the future (in the emerging stages of Evolution of Management Systems). It will become disaggregated and distributed, subjected to non-linear modularity<ref>{{cite journal|last=Slotine|first=Jean-Jacques|title=Modular Stability Tools for Distributed Computation and Control|journal=International Journal of Adaptive Control and Signal Processing|volume=17|url=http://web.mit.edu/nsl/www/preprints/modular.pdf}}</ref>  and bringing forth new ways of making things and delivering services. Then it will become reintegrated again, tying together globally distributed components into a unified recycling whole.\n\n== Early stages ==\nAll early stages are characterized by changing focus of attention within the unchanging, invariant scheme of Figure 1. The management system has typically focused on:\n\n=== Final product ===\n\nThe final product is a primary focus, the production process is considered secondary. Its operations and their sequences are technologically fixed or \u2018given\u2019. Product quality is \u2018inspected in\u2019, mostly at the end of the process. [[Statistical quality control]], [[inventory control]], cost minimization, mass production, [[assembly line]], work specialization, hierarchies of command, mass consumption, statistical mass markets and forecasting are among the defining characteristics of this stage.\n\n=== Partitioned process ===\nIt is the high-quality process that assures the high-quality product. The main focus was on improving of process operations. Quality of the process was understood as the quality of its operations. Powerful new concepts of [[Total Quality Management]] (TQM), [[Continuous Improvement Process]] ([[Kaizen]]) and Just-In-Time (JIT) systems have characterized this stage. Although the operations were being improved, the process architecture and structural sequencing were kept intact and remained technologically \u2018given\u2019.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.springer.com/978-3-642-36683-3 | title=The Evolution of the Concept of\u2018Management Control\u2019 | publisher=Springer | year=2004}}</ref>\n\n=== Integrated process ===\nThe focus of attention shifted from operations (circles) to linkages (arrows) \u2013 thus changing the process architecture itself. The reengineering of the process, re-integrating individual components into effective, more autonomous and even self-manageable wholes, has characterized this stage.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ansoff|first=H.

The main focus was on improving of process operations. Quality of the process was understood as the quality of its operations. Powerful new concepts of [[Total Quality Management]] (TQM), [[Continuous Improvement Process]] ([[Kaizen]]) and Just-In-Time (JIT) systems have characterized this stage.

Among the passengers coming aboard are Douglas Rigby ([[John Leyton]]), the designer, owner, and operator of the diving bell; Giovanni Borghese ([[Rossano Brazzi]]) and his son Leoncavallo ([[Sal Mineo]]), who own and operate the balloon as \"The Flying Borgheses;\" Harry Connerly ([[Brian Keith]]), a [[Underwater diving|diver]]; Connerly{{'}}s mistress Charley Adams ([[Barbara Werle]]), who is a professional [[soprano]] and former [[Bar (establishment)|saloon]] hostess; four female Japanese [[Pearl diving|pearl divers]] led by Toshi ([[Jacqui Chan]]); and Laura Travis ([[Diane Baker]]), a married woman who had an extramarital affair with Hanson in [[Jakarta|Batavia]].\n\nLaura was married to an abusive man with whom she had a son named Peter. Her husband did not want the marriage but also threatened to take Peter away from her if she asked for a divorce. Wanting to be with Hanson, she had asked for a divorce anyway, and her husband had left her, taking both Peter and a fortune in [[pearl]]s with him aboard the steamer ''Arianna''. The ''Arianna'' had sunk off Krakatoa during a storm, and a guilt-ridden Laura, fearing that Peter had died aboard the ''Arianna'' and blaming herself for his death, had spent a year in a [[mental institution]] before coming aboard the ''Batavia Queen''.\n\nHanson has organized the ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s voyage to find the wreck of the ''Arianna'', [[Marine salvage|salvage]] the pearls, and determine Peter{{'}}s fate &ndash; and to find Peter if he is still alive. Hanson plans to use a variety of techniques to search for the wreck and salvage the pearls, with the Borgheses{{'}} balloon conducting an aerial search of shallow waters around Krakatoa, the pearl divers providing a mobile underwater search-and-salvage capability in shallow waters, Rigby in his diving bell searching in deeper water, and Connerly responsible both for recovering the pearls if they are in waters too deep for the pearl divers and for assisting in the heavy work of bringing the ''Arianna''{{'}}s [[safe]] to the surface. Colonial authorities arrive just before the ''Batavia Queen'' departs and force Hanson to take 30 convicts and their jailer aboard for transportation to [[Madura Island]], countering his argument that the ship is not equipped to accommodate them and has no room for them by telling him to transport the prisoners in the ship{{'}}s [[Hold (ship)|hold]] in appalling conditions. Hanson plans to deliver the convicts to Madura after recovering the pearls off Krakatoa.  One of the prisoners, Lester Danzig ([[J. D. Cannon]]), is an acquaintance of Hanson{{'}}s, and Hanson allows him to make the voyage on deck instead of in the hold. Aware that Krakatoa has begun to erupt and warned by a colonial official that the island is a \"raging volcano,\" Hanson replies that the volcano had been quiet for the previous 200 years and posed no threat now.\n\nDuring the ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s voyage to Krakatoa, her crew and passengers observe strange phenomena: They see [[seabird]]s swarming in huge flocks by day, witness a series of fiery explosions erupting from the sea one evening, and hear a high-pitched, ear-splitting hissing and whistling sound like that of escaping [[steam]] on another night. During a conversation on deck one night, Danzig discovers that Connerly is using [[laudanum]] to kill the pain of a lung disease which he is keeping secret from Hanson because it might interfere with his diving abilities. Danzig informs Connerly of Laura's time in the mental institution, calling into question the veracity of her story about the pearls. The Borgheses, Connerly, Charley, Rigby, and Toshi confront Hanson about Laura's mental state, but Hanson assures them that Laura{{'}}s story about the ''Arianna'' is true. Connerly takes so much [[laudanum]] that he hallucinates one night, attacks one of the pearl divers, and assaults several crewmen coming to her aid before they can subdue him. On Hanson's orders, the ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s crew suspends Connerly in a slatted box above the [[main deck]] so that he will pose no danger to others aboard the ship; Charley tearfully pleads with Hanson for Connerly's release, and Hanson relents and frees him. Meanwhile, Leoncavallo and Toshi take a romantic interest in one another.\n\nThe ''Batavia Queen'' arrives off Krakatoa to find the island shrouded in thick smoke. It clears when she anchors off the island, and the Borgheses ascend in their balloon while Rigby descends in his diving bell. The Borgheses quickly discover the wreck of the ''Arianna'' and guide the ''Batavia Queen'' and the submerged Rigby to it. Immediately afterwards, the motor driving the [[propeller]] that allows them to steer their balloon fails and they careen helplessly over Krakatoa and into its active [[Volcanic crater|crater]]. They jettison the useless engine and propeller into the crater{{'}}s [[lava lake]] to reduce weight and finally are blown clear of the crater by a volcanic explosion which sets their balloon afire. They drift away from the island, leap into the sea, and are rescued, but the fire destroys the balloon.\n\nDanzig tells Hanson of Connerly{{'}}s lung problems, and Hanson decides that he will dive on the ''Arianna'' instead of Connerly. While Connerly and Hanson argue over this, Rigby{{'}}s diving bell becomes snagged on [[coral]]. The pearl divers, Hanson, and Connerly all dive into the water to free Rigby, and while they and the ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s other passengers and crew are thus occupied, Danzig steals a pistol he finds in the ship{{'}}s chart room, knocks the jailer unconscious, and frees the prisoners. They take over the ship, throw the unconscious jailer overboard to drown, and imprison the passengers and crew in the hold, where they also place Rigby and the pearl divers when they return to the ''Batavia Queen''. Before returning, and unaware of the turn of events aboard the ''Batavia Queen'', Hanson and Connerly swim to the wreck of the ''Arianna'', find the ship{{'}}s safe, and attach a cable to it to have it hoisted aboard the ''Batavia Queen''. Upon their return, Danzig has Connerly lowered into the hold but forces Hanson to look on at gunpoint as he opens the ''Arianna''{{'}}s safe on the ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s deck. They find nothing in the safe but a cheap [[pocket watch]]. When an explosion on Krakatoa distracts Danzig, Hanson overpowers him, takes the pistol from him, pushes the heavy safe over onto one convict, shoots two others, and uses steam from a hose to force the rest of the prisoners to jump overboard. They swim to nearby Krakatoa, never to be seen again.\n\nAfter Hanson frees the passengers and crew from the hold, Rigby finds another compartment in the safe which contains the ''Arianna''{{'}}s [[logbook]]. Laura and Hanson examine the logbook for clues about Peter{{'}}s fate. The logbook reveals that the ''Arianna'' made a last port call at Palembang before sinking, and a letter tucked into the logbook says that Peter disembarked there to attend the mission school. Hanson decides to steam to Palembang to find Peter. By now, Krakatoa is erupting continually, and the volcano{{'}}s explosions begin to hurl [[lava bomb]]s into the surrounding sea. A number of them strike the ''Batavia Queen'' as she gets underway for Palembang, starting fires which the crew puts out. As Toshi runs across the deck toward Leoncavallo, one of the lava bombs strikes and kills her.\n\nThe ''Batavia Queen'' arrives off Palembang to find the mission school heavily damaged, burning, and abandoned. Hanson hails a passing [[Junk (ship)|junk]], and someone aboard the junk tells him that the staff and students of the school all are alive and had fled Palembang that morning aboard another boat, intending to sail to Java. The ''Batavia Queen'' soon comes to the assistance of an overcrowded and sinking [[sampan]], which proves to be the school{{'}}s boat. The ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s passengers and crew rescue everyone aboard the sampan, including Peter, who has a joyful reunion with Laura. A chest belonging to Peter comes aboard the ''Batavia Queen'' during the rescue; it contains the pearls, and Connerly, Rigby, the Borgheses, and the three surviving pearl divers receive their shares of the fortune.\n\nKrakatoa{{'}}s violent explosions become larger and continuous; Hanson assumes that they will generate a [[tsunami]] and begins to prepare the ''Batavia Queen'' to ride it out. Although Hanson assures him that a tsunami will destroy nearby Anjer and that he is safer at sea aboard the ''Batavia Queen'' if she can get to deep water in time, Connerly disputes the ship{{'}}s ability to survive and demands that Hanson allow those who wish to go ashore to row to Anjer with him in one of the ship{{'}}s [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboats]]. Giovanni Borghese, Charley, and the three surviving pearl divers all join Connerly in the lifeboat and row to Anjer.\n\nKrakatoa disintegrates in one final, cataclysmic explosion, which generates an enormous tsunami. It strikes Anjer shortly after the ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s lifeboat arrives there; unable to outrun the wave, Connerly and Charley embrace for the last time before the wave engulfs and kills them. At sea, Hanson, Laura, Peter, Rigby, Leoncavallo Borghese, the refugees from the mission school, and the ship's crew ride out the tsunami successfully aboard the ''Batavia Queen''.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Maximilian Schell]] as Captain Chris Hanson\n* [[Diane Baker]] as Laura Travis\n* [[Brian Keith]] as Harry Connerly \n* [[Barbara Werle]] as Charley Adams\n* [[Sal Mineo]] as Leoncavallo Borghese\n* [[Rossano Brazzi]] as Giovanni Borghese\n* [[John Leyton]] as Douglas Rigby\n* [[J.D.

Cineaste; New York Vol. 22, Iss. 4,  (1997): 68.</ref>\n\n===Special effects===\nIn an unusual approach to making the film, the producers of ''Krakatoa, East of Java'' had the [[special effects]] scenes shot before the script had been completed. The script then was written so as to incorporate the special effects sequences.<ref name=\"model ships\">[http://modelshipsinthecinema.com/wp/archives/548 Model Ships in the Cinema: ''Krakatoa, East of Java'', 1969, including quotes from Louri\u00e9, Eugene, ''My Work in Films'', Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1985] {{ISBN|0-15-662342-0}}.</ref>\n\nThe French [[film director]], [[art director]], [[production designer]], [[set designer]], and [[screenwriter]] [[Eug\u00e8ne Louri\u00e9]] had worked for the film's producers as art and special-effects director for the 1965 movie ''[[Crack in the World]]'', and they hired him to create the special effects for ''Krakatoa, East of Java''. \n\nIn 1965, Louri\u00e9 scouted the coast of [[Spain]] for a suitable steamer for use in the film as the fictional ''Batavia Queen''; ultimately he chose a [[cargo ship]] &ndash; a former [[passenger-cargo ship]] employed as a [[tramp steamer]] between Spain and [[Morocco]] &ndash; he found unloading [[coal]] at a pier in [[Bilbao]] whose captain said she had been built in [[England]] sometime around 1880. \n\nLouri\u00e9 had the steamer remodeled in [[M\u00e1laga]], Spain, at a [[shipyard]] which transformed her into the ''Batavia Queen'' by increasing the height of her [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]] and [[Mast (sailing)|masts]] and installing new [[Yard (sailing)|yards]] on her masts and a new [[bowsprit]] and carved wooden [[Figurehead (object)|figurehead]] on her [[Bow (ship)|bow]]. The steamer also was provided with functioning [[sail]]s for her masts and yards.<ref name=\"model ships\"/>\n\nFor special effects, Louri\u00e9's team constructed two models of the modified steamer, a one-to-ten-scale model that was 18 feet (5.5 meters) long, and, for long shots of the ''Batavia Queen'' as she approaches Krakatoa, a one-to-twenty-scale model. The latter proved too small to provide realistic effects, so Louri\u00e9 chose not to use it in the film, instead using only the larger model.<ref name=\"model ships\"/>\n\nAfter considering a [[water tank]] in [[Malta]], Louri\u00e9 chose the water tank he had used for the 1964 film ''[[Flight from Ashiya]]'' at [[Cinecitt\u00e0]] in [[Rome]] to film special effects sequences depicting the ''Batavia Queen'' at sea. The tank was approximately 300 by 400 feet (91 by 122 meters) in area and had a sky backing of 70 feet (21 meters). The sequences were filmed using three [[Super Panavision 70]] cameras running at three times normal speed to make the movements of the miniatures more realistic, although the cameras were not designed for such work and often overheated and required repairs. Louri\u00e9 tried to disguise the miniature ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s lack of a crew or passengers as she gets underway for Palembang, slowly picking her way through a narrow passage under a rain of lava bombs while Krakatoa erupts nearby, by enveloping her in smoke. For the final sequence in which the ''Batavia Queen'' rides out a very large tsunami at sea, Louri\u00e9's team spent three days filming the model in the water tank in extreme conditions, creating large waves through the use of 35-foot (10.6-meter) dump tanks with a capacity of 2,600 gallons (9,842 liters),<ref name=\"metric\" group=\"note\">The source does not specify the type of [[gallon]] it uses. This [[Metric system|metric]] conversion from [[English units]] assumes that the English unit used is the [[Gallon#The US liquid gallon|United States liquid gallon]].

It lost to ''[[Marooned (1969 film)|Marooned]]''.<ref name=\"tcm\"/>\n\nLouri\u00e9 himself makes a non-speaking cameo appearance in ''Krakatoa, East of Java'', portraying a [[lighthouse]] keeper on the coast of Java who observes Krakatoa's final, cataclysmic explosion and enters the lighthouse to send news of it by [[telegraph]].<ref name=\"cameo\">[http://modelshipsinthecinema.com/wp/archives/548 Model Ships in the Cinema: ''Krakatoa, East of Java'' (caption for photograph of lighthouse keeper operating telegraph)]</ref>\n\n===Yordan's Departure===\nIn addition to its challenging special effects, the makers of ''Krakatoa, East of Java'' encountered various difficulties during the film's production. Producer [[Philip Yordan]] dropped out of the production after its special effects had already been shot, and a new associate producer came on board who commissioned a new script.<ref name=\"tcm\">[http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/152598%7C0/Krakatoa-East-of-Java.html TCM Film Article: ''Krakatoa, East of Java'']</ref> \n\nThese changes in leadership led to conceptual changes that created some inconsistency in tone and odd moments in the finished film.<ref name=\"tcm\"/> While apparently conceiving ''Krakatoa, East of Java'' overall as a family-friendly adventure story, the producers also opted to attract a more adult audience by including some sordid and racy elements: the tortured relationship between Connerly and Charley and Laura's extramarital affair with Hanson, as well as a [[striptease]] Charley performs for Connerly in their [[state room]].<ref name=\"tcm\"/> \n\nAt other times, the movie{{'}}s soundtrack is clumsily incorporated into the narrative: while performing her striptease, Charley sings a rendition of \"A Nice Old-Fashioned Girl\" that would be appropriate in a [[Musical film|musical]] but seems strangely out of place in an adventure or disaster film, and the vocal version of the movie{{'}}s romantic theme song \"East of Java\" incongruously plays during scenes of filthy prisoners shuffling into the ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s hold and sweating sailors performing the labor necessary to get the ship out to sea as she begins her voyage from Anjer.<ref name=\"tcm\"/>\n\nKowalski said \"We had more than our share of problems because you can't control such varying conditions as weather, sea, children and animals.  But nearly everyone bore up under very trying circumstances. My life was only threatened four times.\"<ref name=\"los\"/>\n\nKowalski added that \"the tendency  in Cinerama has been to employ wide-angle shots that show everybody in the scene. I'm not doing that. I'm cutting quickly from one shot to another so things happen. I'm also devoting much care to the characters. I think if you have a bunch of people that the audience cares about, then you can build up the big scenic effects with no difficulty.\"<ref name=\"los\"/>\n\n===Title===\nDuring production of ''Krakatoa, East of Java'', its producers became aware that Krakatoa is, in fact, west of Java &ndash; and east of Sumatra. ([[Mount Tambora]], on [[Sumbawa]], much less well known than Krakatoa despite its own &ndash; and even larger &ndash; cataclysmic explosion in 1815, is the violent volcano east of Java.) Despite the geographic error in the film's title, its makers chose to leave it unchanged, apparently believing that it was a more exotic title than \"''Krakatoa, West of Java''.\"{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Furthermore, the film aided in popularizing [[Krakatoa#Etymology|the spelling \"Krakatoa\"]], as opposed to the Indonesian spelling \"Krakatau.\"\n\n===Film format===\n''Krakatoa, East of Java'' was filmed in Super Panavision 70 (with some scenes filmed in [[Todd-AO]]), and presented in [[70 mm film|70&nbsp;mm]] [[Cinerama]] in some cinemas. Appearing in cinemas as interest in Cinerama's widescreen format waned, it is the only disaster movie ever to appear in the format.<ref name=\"tcm\"/>\n\n===Novelization===\n[[Michael Avallone]] wrote a novelization of the movie with the same title.\n\n==Historical inaccuracy==\n\nThe catastrophic [[1883 eruption of Krakatoa]]  destroyed most of the uninhabited island and generated tsunamis exceeding 30 meters (100 feet) in height that struck the western coast of Java and southern coast of Sumatra, killing about 35,000 people, while a [[pyroclastic flow]] from the volcano that traveled across the Sunda Strait killed about another 1,000 people on Sumatra.<ref>[http://www.vansandick.com/familie/links/vulcaan2.php#h2 vansandick.com TsuInfo Alert: The eruption of Krakatoa]</ref> ''Krakatoa, East of Java'' is only very loosely based on the actual events surrounding the eruption, which it uses merely as a backdrop for its storyline.\n\nHanson{{'}}s statement early in the film that Krakatoa had been quiet for 200 years is accurate &ndash; the last eruption prior to 1883 appears to have been in 1680<ref>[[Simon Winchester|Winchester, Simon]], ''[[Krakatoa: The Day the World Exploded, August 27, 1883]]'', New York: HarperCollins, 2003, {{ISBN|0-06-621285-5}}, pp. 132-136.</ref> &ndash; and his view that the ongoing volcanic activity on the island, which had begun in May 1883, did not pose a threat to anyone not actually on Krakatoa itself reflected the attitude of many people in the area during the summer of 1883, some of whom treated the erupting volcano as a tourist attraction.<ref>Winchester, Simon, ''Krakatoa: The Day the World Exploded, August 27, 1883'', New York: HarperCollins, 2003, {{ISBN|0-06-621285-5}}, pp. 167-176.</ref>\n\nKrakatoa is actually located west, not east, of Java.\n\nThe ''Batavia Queen'' appears to require at least three days to make the voyage from Anjer to Krakatoa.

Late in the film, when the ''Batavia Queen'' arrives off Palembang in search of Peter Travis, Palembang appears to be along the coast of Sumatra; however, Palembang, while accessible to ships via the [[Musi River (Indonesia)|Musi River]], lies well inland. The ''Batavia Queen'' finds the mission school in ruins and ablaze because of Krakatoa's eruption; although Krakatoa's eruption was audible in Palembang and the air pressure wave from its final explosion was strong enough to shake the walls of houses and cause cracks to appear in some, the town did not suffer the serious damage implied by the condition of the mission school in the film.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=OXcCAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA12&lpg=PA12&q=Palembang%20Krakatoa Anonymous, ''Nature: A Weekly Illustrated Journal of Science, Volume XXX, May 1884 to October 1884'', New York: McMillan and Company, 1884, p. 12.]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Vk8PAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA483&lpg=PA483&q=Palembang%20Krakatoa Symons, G.

The characters are engaged in the recovery of a cargo of [[pearl]]s from a shipwreck perilously close to the volcano.<ref>KRAKATOA - EAST OF JAVA\nMonthly Film Bulletin; London Vol. 36, Iss. 420,  (Jan 1, 1969): 174. </ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1883, the [[volcano]] on the island of [[Krakatoa]] in the [[Netherlands East Indies]] begins to erupt, terrorizing the children at a mission school in [[Palembang]] on nearby [[Sumatra]].  \n\nMeanwhile, across the [[Sunda Strait]] at her [[home port]] of [[Anjer]] on the west coast of [[Java]], the [[Steamship|steamer]] ''Batavia Queen'', under the command of Captain Chris Hanson ([[Maximilian Schell]]), takes aboard passengers and cargo, including a [[diving bell]] and a [[Balloon (aircraft)|balloon]]. Among the passengers coming aboard are Douglas Rigby ([[John Leyton]]), the designer, owner, and operator of the diving bell; Giovanni Borghese ([[Rossano Brazzi]]) and his son Leoncavallo ([[Sal Mineo]]), who own and operate the balloon as \"The Flying Borgheses;\" Harry Connerly ([[Brian Keith]]), a [[Underwater diving|diver]]; Connerly{{'}}s mistress Charley Adams ([[Barbara Werle]]), who is a professional [[soprano]] and former [[Bar (establishment)|saloon]] hostess; four female Japanese [[Pearl diving|pearl divers]] led by Toshi ([[Jacqui Chan]]); and Laura Travis ([[Diane Baker]]), a married woman who had an extramarital affair with Hanson in [[Jakarta|Batavia]].\n\nLaura was married to an abusive man with whom she had a son named Peter. Her husband did not want the marriage but also threatened to take Peter away from her if she asked for a divorce. Wanting to be with Hanson, she had asked for a divorce anyway, and her husband had left her, taking both Peter and a fortune in [[pearl]]s with him aboard the steamer ''Arianna''. The ''Arianna'' had sunk off Krakatoa during a storm, and a guilt-ridden Laura, fearing that Peter had died aboard the ''Arianna'' and blaming herself for his death, had spent a year in a [[mental institution]] before coming aboard the ''Batavia Queen''.\n\nHanson has organized the ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s voyage to find the wreck of the ''Arianna'', [[Marine salvage|salvage]] the pearls, and determine Peter{{'}}s fate &ndash; and to find Peter if he is still alive. Hanson plans to use a variety of techniques to search for the wreck and salvage the pearls, with the Borgheses{{'}} balloon conducting an aerial search of shallow waters around Krakatoa, the pearl divers providing a mobile underwater search-and-salvage capability in shallow waters, Rigby in his diving bell searching in deeper water, and Connerly responsible both for recovering the pearls if they are in waters too deep for the pearl divers and for assisting in the heavy work of bringing the ''Arianna''{{'}}s [[safe]] to the surface. Colonial authorities arrive just before the ''Batavia Queen'' departs and force Hanson to take 30 convicts and their jailer aboard for transportation to [[Madura Island]], countering his argument that the ship is not equipped to accommodate them and has no room for them by telling him to transport the prisoners in the ship{{'}}s [[Hold (ship)|hold]] in appalling conditions. Hanson plans to deliver the convicts to Madura after recovering the pearls off Krakatoa.  One of the prisoners, Lester Danzig ([[J. D. Cannon]]), is an acquaintance of Hanson{{'}}s, and Hanson allows him to make the voyage on deck instead of in the hold. Aware that Krakatoa has begun to erupt and warned by a colonial official that the island is a \"raging volcano,\" Hanson replies that the volcano had been quiet for the previous 200 years and posed no threat now.\n\nDuring the ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s voyage to Krakatoa, her crew and passengers observe strange phenomena: They see [[seabird]]s swarming in huge flocks by day, witness a series of fiery explosions erupting from the sea one evening, and hear a high-pitched, ear-splitting hissing and whistling sound like that of escaping [[steam]] on another night. During a conversation on deck one night, Danzig discovers that Connerly is using [[laudanum]] to kill the pain of a lung disease which he is keeping secret from Hanson because it might interfere with his diving abilities. Danzig informs Connerly of Laura's time in the mental institution, calling into question the veracity of her story about the pearls. The Borgheses, Connerly, Charley, Rigby, and Toshi confront Hanson about Laura's mental state, but Hanson assures them that Laura{{'}}s story about the ''Arianna'' is true. Connerly takes so much [[laudanum]] that he hallucinates one night, attacks one of the pearl divers, and assaults several crewmen coming to her aid before they can subdue him. On Hanson's orders, the ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s crew suspends Connerly in a slatted box above the [[main deck]] so that he will pose no danger to others aboard the ship; Charley tearfully pleads with Hanson for Connerly's release, and Hanson relents and frees him. Meanwhile, Leoncavallo and Toshi take a romantic interest in one another.\n\nThe ''Batavia Queen'' arrives off Krakatoa to find the island shrouded in thick smoke. It clears when she anchors off the island, and the Borgheses ascend in their balloon while Rigby descends in his diving bell. The Borgheses quickly discover the wreck of the ''Arianna'' and guide the ''Batavia Queen'' and the submerged Rigby to it. Immediately afterwards, the motor driving the [[propeller]] that allows them to steer their balloon fails and they careen helplessly over Krakatoa and into its active [[Volcanic crater|crater]]. They jettison the useless engine and propeller into the crater{{'}}s [[lava lake]] to reduce weight and finally are blown clear of the crater by a volcanic explosion which sets their balloon afire. They drift away from the island, leap into the sea, and are rescued, but the fire destroys the balloon.\n\nDanzig tells Hanson of Connerly{{'}}s lung problems, and Hanson decides that he will dive on the ''Arianna'' instead of Connerly. While Connerly and Hanson argue over this, Rigby{{'}}s diving bell becomes snagged on [[coral]]. The pearl divers, Hanson, and Connerly all dive into the water to free Rigby, and while they and the ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s other passengers and crew are thus occupied, Danzig steals a pistol he finds in the ship{{'}}s chart room, knocks the jailer unconscious, and frees the prisoners. They take over the ship, throw the unconscious jailer overboard to drown, and imprison the passengers and crew in the hold, where they also place Rigby and the pearl divers when they return to the ''Batavia Queen''. Before returning, and unaware of the turn of events aboard the ''Batavia Queen'', Hanson and Connerly swim to the wreck of the ''Arianna'', find the ship{{'}}s safe, and attach a cable to it to have it hoisted aboard the ''Batavia Queen''. Upon their return, Danzig has Connerly lowered into the hold but forces Hanson to look on at gunpoint as he opens the ''Arianna''{{'}}s safe on the ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s deck. They find nothing in the safe but a cheap [[pocket watch]]. When an explosion on Krakatoa distracts Danzig, Hanson overpowers him, takes the pistol from him, pushes the heavy safe over onto one convict, shoots two others, and uses steam from a hose to force the rest of the prisoners to jump overboard. They swim to nearby Krakatoa, never to be seen again.\n\nAfter Hanson frees the passengers and crew from the hold, Rigby finds another compartment in the safe which contains the ''Arianna''{{'}}s [[logbook]]. Laura and Hanson examine the logbook for clues about Peter{{'}}s fate. The logbook reveals that the ''Arianna'' made a last port call at Palembang before sinking, and a letter tucked into the logbook says that Peter disembarked there to attend the mission school. Hanson decides to steam to Palembang to find Peter. By now, Krakatoa is erupting continually, and the volcano{{'}}s explosions begin to hurl [[lava bomb]]s into the surrounding sea. A number of them strike the ''Batavia Queen'' as she gets underway for Palembang, starting fires which the crew puts out. As Toshi runs across the deck toward Leoncavallo, one of the lava bombs strikes and kills her.\n\nThe ''Batavia Queen'' arrives off Palembang to find the mission school heavily damaged, burning, and abandoned. Hanson hails a passing [[Junk (ship)|junk]], and someone aboard the junk tells him that the staff and students of the school all are alive and had fled Palembang that morning aboard another boat, intending to sail to Java. The ''Batavia Queen'' soon comes to the assistance of an overcrowded and sinking [[sampan]], which proves to be the school{{'}}s boat. The ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s passengers and crew rescue everyone aboard the sampan, including Peter, who has a joyful reunion with Laura. A chest belonging to Peter comes aboard the ''Batavia Queen'' during the rescue; it contains the pearls, and Connerly, Rigby, the Borgheses, and the three surviving pearl divers receive their shares of the fortune.\n\nKrakatoa{{'}}s violent explosions become larger and continuous; Hanson assumes that they will generate a [[tsunami]] and begins to prepare the ''Batavia Queen'' to ride it out. Although Hanson assures him that a tsunami will destroy nearby Anjer and that he is safer at sea aboard the ''Batavia Queen'' if she can get to deep water in time, Connerly disputes the ship{{'}}s ability to survive and demands that Hanson allow those who wish to go ashore to row to Anjer with him in one of the ship{{'}}s [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboats]]. Giovanni Borghese, Charley, and the three surviving pearl divers all join Connerly in the lifeboat and row to Anjer.\n\nKrakatoa disintegrates in one final, cataclysmic explosion, which generates an enormous tsunami. It strikes Anjer shortly after the ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s lifeboat arrives there; unable to outrun the wave, Connerly and Charley embrace for the last time before the wave engulfs and kills them. At sea, Hanson, Laura, Peter, Rigby, Leoncavallo Borghese, the refugees from the mission school, and the ship's crew ride out the tsunami successfully aboard the ''Batavia Queen''.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Maximilian Schell]] as Captain Chris Hanson\n* [[Diane Baker]] as Laura Travis\n* [[Brian Keith]] as Harry Connerly \n* [[Barbara Werle]] as Charley Adams\n* [[Sal Mineo]] as Leoncavallo Borghese\n* [[Rossano Brazzi]] as Giovanni Borghese\n* [[John Leyton]] as Douglas Rigby\n* [[J.D.

The script then was written so as to incorporate the special effects sequences.<ref name=\"model ships\">[http://modelshipsinthecinema.com/wp/archives/548 Model Ships in the Cinema: ''Krakatoa, East of Java'', 1969, including quotes from Louri\u00e9, Eugene, ''My Work in Films'', Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1985] {{ISBN|0-15-662342-0}}.</ref>\n\nThe French [[film director]], [[art director]], [[production designer]], [[set designer]], and [[screenwriter]] [[Eug\u00e8ne Louri\u00e9]] had worked for the film's producers as art and special-effects director for the 1965 movie ''[[Crack in the World]]'', and they hired him to create the special effects for ''Krakatoa, East of Java''. \n\nIn 1965, Louri\u00e9 scouted the coast of [[Spain]] for a suitable steamer for use in the film as the fictional ''Batavia Queen''; ultimately he chose a [[cargo ship]] &ndash; a former [[passenger-cargo ship]] employed as a [[tramp steamer]] between Spain and [[Morocco]] &ndash; he found unloading [[coal]] at a pier in [[Bilbao]] whose captain said she had been built in [[England]] sometime around 1880. \n\nLouri\u00e9 had the steamer remodeled in [[M\u00e1laga]], Spain, at a [[shipyard]] which transformed her into the ''Batavia Queen'' by increasing the height of her [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]] and [[Mast (sailing)|masts]] and installing new [[Yard (sailing)|yards]] on her masts and a new [[bowsprit]] and carved wooden [[Figurehead (object)|figurehead]] on her [[Bow (ship)|bow]]. The steamer also was provided with functioning [[sail]]s for her masts and yards.<ref name=\"model ships\"/>\n\nFor special effects, Louri\u00e9's team constructed two models of the modified steamer, a one-to-ten-scale model that was 18 feet (5.5 meters) long, and, for long shots of the ''Batavia Queen'' as she approaches Krakatoa, a one-to-twenty-scale model. The latter proved too small to provide realistic effects, so Louri\u00e9 chose not to use it in the film, instead using only the larger model.<ref name=\"model ships\"/>\n\nAfter considering a [[water tank]] in [[Malta]], Louri\u00e9 chose the water tank he had used for the 1964 film ''[[Flight from Ashiya]]'' at [[Cinecitt\u00e0]] in [[Rome]] to film special effects sequences depicting the ''Batavia Queen'' at sea. The tank was approximately 300 by 400 feet (91 by 122 meters) in area and had a sky backing of 70 feet (21 meters). The sequences were filmed using three [[Super Panavision 70]] cameras running at three times normal speed to make the movements of the miniatures more realistic, although the cameras were not designed for such work and often overheated and required repairs. Louri\u00e9 tried to disguise the miniature ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s lack of a crew or passengers as she gets underway for Palembang, slowly picking her way through a narrow passage under a rain of lava bombs while Krakatoa erupts nearby, by enveloping her in smoke. For the final sequence in which the ''Batavia Queen'' rides out a very large tsunami at sea, Louri\u00e9's team spent three days filming the model in the water tank in extreme conditions, creating large waves through the use of 35-foot (10.6-meter) dump tanks with a capacity of 2,600 gallons (9,842 liters),<ref name=\"metric\" group=\"note\">The source does not specify the type of [[gallon]] it uses. This [[Metric system|metric]] conversion from [[English units]] assumes that the English unit used is the [[Gallon#The US liquid gallon|United States liquid gallon]].

It lost to ''[[Marooned (1969 film)|Marooned]]''.<ref name=\"tcm\"/>\n\nLouri\u00e9 himself makes a non-speaking cameo appearance in ''Krakatoa, East of Java'', portraying a [[lighthouse]] keeper on the coast of Java who observes Krakatoa's final, cataclysmic explosion and enters the lighthouse to send news of it by [[telegraph]].<ref name=\"cameo\">[http://modelshipsinthecinema.com/wp/archives/548 Model Ships in the Cinema: ''Krakatoa, East of Java'' (caption for photograph of lighthouse keeper operating telegraph)]</ref>\n\n===Yordan's Departure===\nIn addition to its challenging special effects, the makers of ''Krakatoa, East of Java'' encountered various difficulties during the film's production. Producer [[Philip Yordan]] dropped out of the production after its special effects had already been shot, and a new associate producer came on board who commissioned a new script.<ref name=\"tcm\">[http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/152598%7C0/Krakatoa-East-of-Java.html TCM Film Article: ''Krakatoa, East of Java'']</ref> \n\nThese changes in leadership led to conceptual changes that created some inconsistency in tone and odd moments in the finished film.<ref name=\"tcm\"/> While apparently conceiving ''Krakatoa, East of Java'' overall as a family-friendly adventure story, the producers also opted to attract a more adult audience by including some sordid and racy elements: the tortured relationship between Connerly and Charley and Laura's extramarital affair with Hanson, as well as a [[striptease]] Charley performs for Connerly in their [[state room]].<ref name=\"tcm\"/> \n\nAt other times, the movie{{'}}s soundtrack is clumsily incorporated into the narrative: while performing her striptease, Charley sings a rendition of \"A Nice Old-Fashioned Girl\" that would be appropriate in a [[Musical film|musical]] but seems strangely out of place in an adventure or disaster film, and the vocal version of the movie{{'}}s romantic theme song \"East of Java\" incongruously plays during scenes of filthy prisoners shuffling into the ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s hold and sweating sailors performing the labor necessary to get the ship out to sea as she begins her voyage from Anjer.<ref name=\"tcm\"/>\n\nKowalski said \"We had more than our share of problems because you can't control such varying conditions as weather, sea, children and animals.  But nearly everyone bore up under very trying circumstances. My life was only threatened four times.\"<ref name=\"los\"/>\n\nKowalski added that \"the tendency  in Cinerama has been to employ wide-angle shots that show everybody in the scene. I'm not doing that. I'm cutting quickly from one shot to another so things happen. I'm also devoting much care to the characters. I think if you have a bunch of people that the audience cares about, then you can build up the big scenic effects with no difficulty.\"<ref name=\"los\"/>\n\n===Title===\nDuring production of ''Krakatoa, East of Java'', its producers became aware that Krakatoa is, in fact, west of Java &ndash; and east of Sumatra.

There were eight depressions in the basin, which is [[Indian Ocean]] north of the [[equator]]. The basin is subdivided between the [[Bay of Bengal]] and the [[Arabian Sea]] on the east and west coasts of India, respectively. Storms were tracked by the [[India Meteorological Department]] (IMD), which is the basin's [[Regional Specialized Meteorological Center]], as well as the American-based [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC) on an unofficial basis.\n\nTropical activity was largely affected by the [[monsoon trough]], which spawned the three deep depressions in May, as well as the two strongest cyclones in November. The first storm of the season formed on May&nbsp;5 in the Bay of Bengal, the same location as two additional depressions later in the month. Collectively, the three systems killed 146&nbsp;people, mostly related to the third system which produced a deadly [[storm surge]] in [[Bangladesh]]. After two weak depressions in September, the season's lone Arabian Sea storm developed on October&nbsp;12, and remained largely away from land. The final two storms of the season were the most notable. On November&nbsp;10, [[1995 India cyclone|a cyclone]] struck southeastern India, killing 173&nbsp;people in India and Bangladesh. Its remnants produced a rare snowstorm in eastern Nepal that caused landslides and avalanches, killing 63. The last storm of the season was also the most powerful, causing 172&nbsp;deaths when it struck southeastern Bangladesh.\n__TOC__\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Season summary==\n<center>\n<timeline>\nImageSize = width:900 height:200\nPlotArea  = top:10 bottom:80 right:50 left:20\nLegend    = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270\nAlignBars = early\nDateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod     = from:01/05/1995 till:01/12/1995\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/05/1995\nColors     =\n  id:canvas value:gray(0.88)\n  id:GP     value:red\n  id:TD     value:rgb(0.5,0.8,1)      legend:Depression_=_\u226451_km/h_(\u226431_mph)\n  id:DD     value:rgb(0.37,0.73,1)    legend:Deep_Depression_=_52\u201361_km/h_(32\u201338_mph)\n  id:TS     value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96)    legend:Cyclonic_Storm_=_62\u201387_km/h_(39\u201354_mph)\n  id:ST     value:rgb(0.80,1,1)       legend:Severe_Cyclonic_Storm_=_88\u2013119_km/h_(55\u201373_mph)\n  id:VS     value:rgb(1,1,0.8)        legend:Very_Severe_Cyclonic_Storm_=_118\u2013165_km/h_(73\u2013102_mph)\n  id:ES     value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25)    legend:Extremely_Severe_Cyclonic_Storm_=_166\u2013221_km/h_(103\u2013137_mph)\n  id:SU     value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38)    legend:Super_Cyclonic_Storm_=_\u2265222_km/h_(\u2265138_mph)\nBackgroundcolors = canvas:canvas\nBarData =\n  barset:Hurricane\n  bar:Month\nPlotData=\n  barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till\n  from:06/05/1995 till:06/05/1995 color:DD text:BOB 01\n  from:09/05/1995 till:10/05/1995 color:DD text:BOB 02\n  from:15/05/1995 till:17/05/1995 color:DD text:BOB 03\n  from:15/09/1995 till:17/09/1995 color:TD text:BOB 04\n  from:26/09/1995 till:28/09/1995 color:TD text:BOB 05\n  from:13/10/1995 till:17/10/1995 color:TS text:ARB 01\n  from:07/11/1995 till:10/11/1995 color:VS text:BOB 06\n  from:21/11/1995 till:25/11/1995 color:ES text:BOB 07\n  bar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas\n\n  from:01/05/1995 till:01/06/1995 text:May\n  from:01/06/1995 till:01/07/1995 text:June\n  from:01/07/1995 till:01/08/1995 text:July\n  from:01/08/1995 till:01/09/1995 text:August\n  from:01/09/1995 till:01/10/1995 text:September\n  from:01/10/1995 till:01/11/1995 text:October\n  from:01/11/1995 till:01/12/1995 text:November\n\n</timeline>\n</center>\nThe [[India Meteorological Department]] (IMD) in [[New Delhi]] &ndash; the official [[Regional Specialized Meteorological Center]] for the northern [[Indian Ocean]] as recognized by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] &ndash; issued warnings for tropical cyclones developing in the region, using satellite imagery and surface data to assess and predict storms.<ref name=\"wmo\"/> The agency also utilized a [[tropical cyclone forecast model]] that used climatology and a storm's persistence to forecast future movement.

the exception of three short-lived [[Tropical cyclone scales#North Indian Ocean|deep depressions]] in May. There were eight depressions in the basin, which is [[Indian Ocean]] north of the [[equator]]. The basin is subdivided between the [[Bay of Bengal]] and the [[Arabian Sea]] on the east and west coasts of India, respectively. Storms were tracked by the [[India Meteorological Department]] (IMD), which is the basin's [[Regional Specialized Meteorological Center]], as well as the American-based [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC) on an unofficial basis.\n\nTropical activity was largely affected by the [[monsoon trough]], which spawned the three deep depressions in May, as well as the two strongest cyclones in November. The first storm of the season formed on May&nbsp;5 in the Bay of Bengal, the same location as two additional depressions later in the month. Collectively, the three systems killed 146&nbsp;people, mostly related to the third system which produced a deadly [[storm surge]] in [[Bangladesh]]. After two weak depressions in September, the season's lone Arabian Sea storm developed on October&nbsp;12, and remained largely away from land. The final two storms of the season were the most notable. On November&nbsp;10, [[1995 India cyclone|a cyclone]] struck southeastern India, killing 173&nbsp;people in India and Bangladesh. Its remnants produced a rare snowstorm in eastern Nepal that caused landslides and avalanches, killing 63. The last storm of the season was also the most powerful, causing 172&nbsp;deaths when it struck southeastern Bangladesh.\n__TOC__\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Season summary==\n<center>\n<timeline>\nImageSize = width:900 height:200\nPlotArea  = top:10 bottom:80 right:50 left:20\nLegend    = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270\nAlignBars = early\nDateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod     = from:01/05/1995 till:01/12/1995\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/05/1995\nColors     =\n  id:canvas value:gray(0.88)\n  id:GP     value:red\n  id:TD     value:rgb(0.5,0.8,1)      legend:Depression_=_\u226451_km/h_(\u226431_mph)\n  id:DD     value:rgb(0.37,0.73,1)    legend:Deep_Depression_=_52\u201361_km/h_(32\u201338_mph)\n  id:TS     value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96)    legend:Cyclonic_Storm_=_62\u201387_km/h_(39\u201354_mph)\n  id:ST     value:rgb(0.80,1,1)       legend:Severe_Cyclonic_Storm_=_88\u2013119_km/h_(55\u201373_mph)\n  id:VS     value:rgb(1,1,0.8)        legend:Very_Severe_Cyclonic_Storm_=_118\u2013165_km/h_(73\u2013102_mph)\n  id:ES     value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25)    legend:Extremely_Severe_Cyclonic_Storm_=_166\u2013221_km/h_(103\u2013137_mph)\n  id:SU     value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38)    legend:Super_Cyclonic_Storm_=_\u2265222_km/h_(\u2265138_mph)\nBackgroundcolors = canvas:canvas\nBarData =\n  barset:Hurricane\n  bar:Month\nPlotData=\n  barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till\n  from:06/05/1995 till:06/05/1995 color:DD text:BOB 01\n  from:09/05/1995 till:10/05/1995 color:DD text:BOB 02\n  from:15/05/1995 till:17/05/1995 color:DD text:BOB 03\n  from:15/09/1995 till:17/09/1995 color:TD text:BOB 04\n  from:26/09/1995 till:28/09/1995 color:TD text:BOB 05\n  from:13/10/1995 till:17/10/1995 color:TS text:ARB 01\n  from:07/11/1995 till:10/11/1995 color:VS text:BOB 06\n  from:21/11/1995 till:25/11/1995 color:ES text:BOB 07\n  bar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas\n\n  from:01/05/1995 till:01/06/1995 text:May\n  from:01/06/1995 till:01/07/1995 text:June\n  from:01/07/1995 till:01/08/1995 text:July\n  from:01/08/1995 till:01/09/1995 text:August\n  from:01/09/1995 till:01/10/1995 text:September\n  from:01/10/1995 till:01/11/1995 text:October\n  from:01/11/1995 till:01/12/1995 text:November\n\n</timeline>\n</center>\nThe [[India Meteorological Department]] (IMD) in [[New Delhi]] &ndash; the official [[Regional Specialized Meteorological Center]] for the northern [[Indian Ocean]] as recognized by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] &ndash; issued warnings for tropical cyclones developing in the region, using satellite imagery and surface data to assess and predict storms.<ref name=\"wmo\"/> The agency also utilized a [[tropical cyclone forecast model]] that used climatology and a storm's persistence to forecast future movement.

He developed [[shock tube]]s, which were able to produce the extremely hot gases needed to simulate atmospheric re-entry from orbital speeds, thereby solving the critical nose cone re-entry heating problem and accelerating the development of recoverable spacecraft. He was AERL's director, chief executive officer, and chairman until 1978 when he took on a professorship at [[Dartmouth College]].

He first suggested a system of [[laser propulsion]] to launch bulk payloads into orbit, using energy from ground-based lasers to increase exhaust velocity and thereby reduce the [[rocket equation|propellant-to-payload mass ratio]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}   His concepts on laser propulsion were published in 1988.<ref>A.

He invented the [[total energy variometer]] in 1939, used in soaring planes, and is the co-inventor of an early scheme for magnetically contained [[nuclear fusion]], patent application, 1941. In 1950, he invented a technique for producing the supersonic source for molecular beams [http://article.pubs.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ppv/RPViewDoc?issn=1480-3291&volume=48&issue=6&startPage=927]; this was subsequently used by chemists in research that led to two [[Nobel Prize]]s.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, he led the design and development at AERL of the first [[intra-aortic balloon pump]]. The balloon pump is a temporary cardiac assist device which has been used worldwide on three million people. The device was used on his own failing heart.\n\nAnother contribution to science was the stagnation-point flow experiment in which processes of initial interaction of fresh flowing blood with an artificial surface can be directly visualized under a high-power microscope. This technique has become an important method for experimentally studying this vital interaction and led to a variety of circulatory prostheses, including the artificial heart.\n\nKantrowitz, as an advocate of the separation of science and technology from political or ideological concerns, first proposed in 1967 the creation of an Institution for Scientific Judgment, commonly referred to as the Science Court, to assess the state of knowledge in [[scientific controversies]] of importance to public policy.

A technical description of the limit is yet needed in this article. -->\n\n====Applications====\nThe [[Kantrowitz Limit|Kantrowitz limit]] has many applications in the [[gas dynamics]] of [[fluid mechanics|inlet flow]] for [[jet engine]]s and [[launch vehicle|rockets]], both when operating at high-subsonic and [[supersonic]] velocities.\n\nTwo examples will explain the effect of the Kantrowitz Limit on a [[nozzle]]. For both cases, [[Mass flow rate]] = Inlet Velocity multiplied by Area multiplied by Density.\n\nConsider a nozzle connected to a vacuum source. As the pressure ratio gets to about 2, the flow through the nozzle will approach the local speed of sound, and the flow becomes [[choked flow]]. When the absolute pressure of the vacuum is decreased further, the flow speed will not increase. This is the Kantrowitz Limit, which limits the mass flow because the velocity is limited to the speed of sound, and the area, inlet pressure and density are all fixed. Aircraft jet engines are very much affected by this limit, once the inlet flow speed gets to Mach 1 the mass flow rate is limited, regardless of how much suction the engine creates.\n\nNext, consider the nozzle connected to a compressed air supply. With a pressure ratio of about 2, the flow becomes choked, and cannot exceed the speed of sound. But the density and resultant mass flow rate can be increased by increasing the inlet pressure. The greater the pressure, the greater the density, and the greater the mass flow. So, while Kantrowitz limits the maximum gas velocity, it does not apply any fixed limit to the mass flow rate.\n\nA recent high-speed transportation option for rapid transit between populous city-pairs about {{convert|1000|mi}} apart, the [[Hyperloop]], has the Kantrowitz limit as a fundamental design criterion.  Attempting to pass a high-speed passenger-pod through a very low pressure tube runs squarely into the Kantrowitz fluid flow limit. Historically, the solutions to working within the limit have been \"go fast\" and \"go slow\".  A major innovation in the Hyperloop proposal provides a novel third approach to remain below the Kantrowitz limit while still moving at high-subsonic velocities: adding a front-end inlet compressor to actively transfer high-pressure air from the front to the rear of the high-speed transport capsule, and thus bypassing much of the air that would have resulted in the [[Shock (fluid dynamics)|dynamic shock]] of the [[choked flow]]. The flow in the smaller duct through the capsule is also subject to the Kantrowitz Limit, this is relieved by increasing the pressure and the density to achieve the required mass flow. In the Hyperloop alpha design of 2013, the air-inlet pump also provides a low-friction [[Air bearing|air-bearing]] [[suspension system]]  for  traveling  at  over  {{convert|700|mph|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}.<ref name=\"AlphaSpaceX20130812\">\n{{cite web |url=http://www.spacex.com/sites/spacex/files/hyperloop_alpha-20130812.pdf |title=Hyperloop Alpha |first=Elon|last=Musk |publisher=SpaceX |pages=3\u20134 |date=August 12, 2013 |accessdate=August 14, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Honors and awards==\n\nKantrowitz was a fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], American Association for the Advancement of Science, American Astronautical Society, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (honorary), American Physical Society, American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering and member of the [[National Academy of Engineering]] and [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] and International Academy of Astronautics.
