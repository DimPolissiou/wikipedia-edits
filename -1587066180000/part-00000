Its range extends from central Argentina in the south to the US-Mexico border in the north, through Central and South America east of the [[Andes]]. The jaguarundi is a medium-sized cat of slender build and uniform coloration that differs significantly from other [[Neotropics|neotropical]] cats (such as the small, spotted cats in the [[genus]] ''[[Leopardus]]'') in its external appearance. In fact, the jaguarundi shows several features seen in [[mustelid]]s (such as [[otter]]s and [[weasel]]s)\u2014it has an elongated body with relatively short legs, a small, narrow head, small, round ears, a short [[snout]] and a long tail. Around twice as large as the [[domestic cat]], the jaguarundi stands {{convert|14|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} at the shoulder and weighs {{convert|3.5|\u2013|7|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. There are two color [[Morph (zoology)|morph]]s\u2014gray and red.\n\nSecretive and alert, the jaguarundi is typically solitary or forms pairs in the wild, though captive individuals are gregarious. Unlike other [[Sympatry|sympatric]] cats such as [[ocelot]]s, the jaguarundi is more active during the day and hunts mainly during daytime and evening hours. Individuals live in large [[home range]]s, and are sparsely distributed within a region. Though an efficient climber and swimmer, the jaguarundi typically prefers hunting on ground. It feeds on various kinds of prey, especially ground-feeding birds, reptiles, [[rodent]]s and small mammals. Mating occurs throughout the year, with peaks at different times of the year across the range. After a [[gestation period]] of 70 to 75 days, the female gives birth to a litter of one to four kittens. Lifespan of up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.\n\nJaguarundis occur in a broad array of closed as well as open habitats ranging from tropical rainforests and [[deciduous forest]]s to deserts and [[thorn scrub]]s. While they are fairly common in Brazil, Peru and Venezuela, jaguarundis may have gone [[extinct]] in the US. The [[IUCN]] lists the jaguarundi as [[Least Concern]], but populations are in decline in many parts of its range due to loss and [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]] of their habitat and persecution for killing poultry.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe common name \"jaguarundi\" ({{IPAc-en|\u02cc|\u0292|\u00e6|\u0261|w|\u0259|\u02c8|r|\u028c|n|d|i}}) comes from the [[Guarani language|Old Guarani]] word ''yaguarundi'', similar to the [[Old Tupi]] word ''yawaum'di''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ferreira |first=A.B.H. |year=1986 |title=Novo Dicion\u00e1rio da L\u00edngua Portuguesa|language=Portuguese |trans-title=New Dictionary of the Portuguese Language |edition=2nd|place=Rio de Janeiro |publisher=Nova Fronteira |page=980}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Merriam-Webster|jaguarundi|accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> In some [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking countries, the jaguarundi is also called ''gato colorado'', ''gato moro'', ''le\u00f3n brenero'', ''leoncillo'' and ''tigrillo''.<ref name=iucn/> It is also called ''eyra'', ''gato-mourisco'', ''gato-preto'', ''gato-vermelho'' and ''maracaj\u00e1-preto'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=de Miranda |first1=E.E. |last2=Gambarini |first2=A. |title=Natureza, Conserva\u00e7\u00e3o e Cultura: Ensaio sobre a Rela\u00e7\u00e3o do Homem com a Natureza no Brasil |trans-title=Nature, Conservation and Culture: Essay on the Relationship between Man and Nature in Brazil |date=2003 |publisher=Metalivros |location=S\u00e3o Paulo |isbn=9788585371470 |page=113 |language=Portuguese}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Nowell |editor1-first=K. |editor2-last=Jackson |editor2-first=P. |editor3-last=IUCN/SSC Cat Specialist Group |title=Wild Cats: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan |date=1996 |publisher=IUCN |location=Gland |isbn=978-2-8317-0045-8 |page=146}}</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''Felis yagouarundi'' was the [[scientific name]] used by [[\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] in 1803 who described two [[zoological specimen|specimen]]s from Central America, including one from [[French Guiana]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, \u00c9. |authorlink=\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire |year=1803 |title=Catalogue des Mammif\u00e8res du Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle |trans-title=Catalogue of Mammals of the National Museum of Natural History| language=French |location=Paris |publisher=Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle |page=124 |chapter=Le chat yagouarundi.

In captivity, females in [[estrus]] have been observed making faint sounds as they [[scent mark]] the area around their enclosures.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ms/> \n\n===Diet===\n[[File:Puma yagouaroundi, ZOO Praha 254.jpg|thumb|Jaguarundis are [[Generalist and specialist species|generalist]] carnivores.]]\nThe jaguarundi typically feed on small-sized prey weighing less than {{convert|1|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, including ground-feeding birds, reptiles, [[rodent]]s and small mammals. Jaguarundis will also take larger prey such as domestic poultry, fish, [[marmoset]]s, rabbits and [[opossum]]s; a study recorded small deer (possibly [[carrion]]) in the diet. Vegetation such as grasses have also been recorded in their diet.<ref name=Hunter/><ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ceballos/><ref name=ms/> A study showed jaguarundis take {{convert|400|g|oz|abbr=on}} vertebrate prey on an average everyday.<ref name=ms/> The broad array of prey recorded for the jaguarundi across its range and varying proportions of different prey in its diet could indicate that the cat tends to feed on the most abundant and easily catchable prey in the area.<ref name=WCoW/>\n\n===Reproduction===\nJaguarundis have been observed mating all year round, with peaks at different times of the year across the range; for instance, in Mexico breeding peaks in January and March. Estrus lasts three to five days, marked by the female regularly rolling onto her back and [[spraying urine]]. [[Sexually mature]] males will pursue the female, not reacting to any aggressive behavior from her side. As in many other felids, the male bites the fur on the female's neck on mounting; the female lets out a loud scream on penetration.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ms/>\n\nAfter a [[gestation]] period of 70 to 75 days, the female gives birth to a litter of one to four kittens in a den constructed in a dense thicket, hollow tree, or similar cover. The kittens are covered well with fur and the underside is marked with spots, which disappear as they age; the coat color gradually changes as the kittens grow older.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ceballos/> The mother starts bringing solid food for the kittens when they are around three weeks old, who simply play with it till the mother ingests it; kittens are capable of taking solid food like birds and guinea pigs at around six weeks. Jaguarundis become sexually mature at one to three years of age. Lifespan up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=Nowak/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe jaguarundi inhabits a wide variety of habitats\u2014from tropical rainforests and [[deciduous forest]]s to deserts and [[thorn scrub]]s. It can also occur in [[cloud forest]]s, [[mangrove]]s and [[savanna]]s.<ref name=iucn/><ref name=ceballos/> Unlike the [[Sympatry|sympatric]] [[margay]], [[ocelot]] and [[oncilla]], the jaguarundi can occur in open areas as well. In open habitats the jaguarundi prefers areas with vegetative cover such as cacti, which would generally be difficult for possible predators to penetrate; there may be a few clearings at the periphery of such areas. Jaguarundis tend to stay close to a source of running water.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=fws.gov/><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Coronado-Quibrera |first1=W.P. |last2=Olmos-Oropeza |first2=G. |last3=Bender |first3=L.C. |last4=Rosas-Rosas |first4=O.C. |last5=Palacio-N\u00fa\u00f1ez |first5=J. |last6=Tarango-Ar\u00e1mbula |first6=L.A. |last7=Herrera-Haro |first7=J.G. |title=Adaptability of the threatened jaguarundi (''Herpailurus yagouaroundi'' Schereber, 1777) to human-altered environments in San Luis Potos\u00ed, Mexico |journal=Acta Zool\u00f3gica Mexicana |date=2019 |volume=35 |pages=1\u201315 |doi=10.21829/azm.2019.3502210 |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/310f/6597fd914eb664e160637b4b1b1d57d87fe7.pdf}}</ref> The jaguarundi is noted for its resistance to environmental disturbances in its habitat; it can successfully thrive in reforested areas.<ref name=ceballos/> While commonly inhabiting lowlands up to {{convert|2000|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the sea level, this cat has been reported at elevations as high as {{convert|3200|m|ft|abbr=on}} in Colombia.<ref name=iucn/>\n\nThe range extends from central Argentina in the south to the US-Mexico border in the north, through Central and South America east of the Andes\u2014second only to the cougar in the [[Latitude|latitudinal]] extent of its distribution.

[[felidae|cat]] native to the Americas. Its range extends from central Argentina in the south to the US-Mexico border in the north, through Central and South America east of the [[Andes]]. The jaguarundi is a medium-sized cat of slender build and uniform coloration that differs significantly from other [[Neotropics|neotropical]] cats (such as the small, spotted cats in the [[genus]] ''[[Leopardus]]'') in its external appearance. In fact, the jaguarundi shows several features seen in [[mustelid]]s (such as [[otter]]s and [[weasel]]s)\u2014it has an elongated body with relatively short legs, a small, narrow head, small, round ears, a short [[snout]] and a long tail. Around twice as large as the [[domestic cat]], the jaguarundi stands {{convert|14|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} at the shoulder and weighs {{convert|3.5|\u2013|7|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. There are two color [[Morph (zoology)|morph]]s\u2014gray and red.\n\nSecretive and alert, the jaguarundi is typically solitary or forms pairs in the wild, though captive individuals are gregarious. Unlike other [[Sympatry|sympatric]] cats such as [[ocelot]]s, the jaguarundi is more active during the day and hunts mainly during daytime and evening hours. Individuals live in large [[home range]]s, and are sparsely distributed within a region. Though an efficient climber and swimmer, the jaguarundi typically prefers hunting on ground. It feeds on various kinds of prey, especially ground-feeding birds, reptiles, [[rodent]]s and small mammals. Mating occurs throughout the year, with peaks at different times of the year across the range. After a [[gestation period]] of 70 to 75 days, the female gives birth to a litter of one to four kittens. Lifespan of up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.\n\nJaguarundis occur in a broad array of closed as well as open habitats ranging from tropical rainforests and [[deciduous forest]]s to deserts and [[thorn scrub]]s. While they are fairly common in Brazil, Peru and Venezuela, jaguarundis may have gone [[extinct]] in the US. The [[IUCN]] lists the jaguarundi as [[Least Concern]], but populations are in decline in many parts of its range due to loss and [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]] of their habitat and persecution for killing poultry.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe common name \"jaguarundi\" ({{IPAc-en|\u02cc|\u0292|\u00e6|\u0261|w|\u0259|\u02c8|r|\u028c|n|d|i}}) comes from the [[Guarani language|Old Guarani]] word ''yaguarundi'', similar to the [[Old Tupi]] word ''yawaum'di''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ferreira |first=A.B.H. |year=1986 |title=Novo Dicion\u00e1rio da L\u00edngua Portuguesa|language=Portuguese |trans-title=New Dictionary of the Portuguese Language |edition=2nd|place=Rio de Janeiro |publisher=Nova Fronteira |page=980}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Merriam-Webster|jaguarundi|accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> In some [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking countries, the jaguarundi is also called ''gato colorado'', ''gato moro'', ''le\u00f3n brenero'', ''leoncillo'' and ''tigrillo''.<ref name=iucn/> It is also called ''eyra'', ''gato-mourisco'', ''gato-preto'', ''gato-vermelho'' and ''maracaj\u00e1-preto'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=de Miranda |first1=E.E. |last2=Gambarini |first2=A. |title=Natureza, Conserva\u00e7\u00e3o e Cultura: Ensaio sobre a Rela\u00e7\u00e3o do Homem com a Natureza no Brasil |trans-title=Nature, Conservation and Culture: Essay on the Relationship between Man and Nature in Brazil |date=2003 |publisher=Metalivros |location=S\u00e3o Paulo |isbn=9788585371470 |page=113 |language=Portuguese}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Nowell |editor1-first=K. |editor2-last=Jackson |editor2-first=P. |editor3-last=IUCN/SSC Cat Specialist Group |title=Wild Cats: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan |date=1996 |publisher=IUCN |location=Gland |isbn=978-2-8317-0045-8 |page=146}}</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''Felis yagouarundi'' was the [[scientific name]] used by [[\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] in 1803 who described two [[zoological specimen|specimen]]s from Central America, including one from [[French Guiana]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, \u00c9. |authorlink=\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire |year=1803 |title=Catalogue des Mammif\u00e8res du Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle |trans-title=Catalogue of Mammals of the National Museum of Natural History| language=French |location=Paris |publisher=Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle |page=124 |chapter=Le chat yagouarundi.

Estrus lasts three to five days, marked by the female regularly rolling onto her back and [[spraying urine]]. [[Sexually mature]] males will pursue the female, not reacting to any aggressive behavior from her side. As in many other felids, the male bites the fur on the female's neck on mounting; the female lets out a loud scream on penetration.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ms/>\n\nAfter a [[gestation]] period of 70 to 75 days, the female gives birth to a litter of one to four kittens in a den constructed in a dense thicket, hollow tree, or similar cover. The kittens are covered well with fur and the underside is marked with spots, which disappear as they age; the coat color gradually changes as the kittens grow older.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ceballos/> The mother starts bringing solid food for the kittens when they are around three weeks old, who simply play with it till the mother ingests it; kittens are capable of taking solid food like birds and guinea pigs at around six weeks. Jaguarundis become sexually mature at one to three years of age. Lifespan up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=Nowak/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe jaguarundi inhabits a wide variety of habitats\u2014from tropical rainforests and [[deciduous forest]]s to deserts and [[thorn scrub]]s.

P. Ruck]], Jeremy Bigwood, Danny Staples, [[Richard Evans Schultes]], [[Jonathan Ott]] and [[R. Gordon Wasson]]). The term is derived from two words of [[Ancient Greek]], \u1f14\u03bd\u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c2 (''\u00e9ntheos'') and \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03ad\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 (''gen\u00e9sthai''). The adjective ''entheos'' translates to English as \"full of the god, inspired, process\", and is the root of the English word \"[[enthusiasm]].\" The Greeks used it as a term of praise for poets and other artists. ''Genesthai'' means \"to come into being.\" Thus, an entheogen is a drug that causes one to become inspired or to experience feelings of inspiration, often in a religious or \"spiritual\" manner.<ref name=Godlaski2011>{{cite journal |author=Godlaski, Theodore M |title=The God within |journal=Substance Use and Misuse |year=2011 |volume=46 |issue=10 |pages=1217\u20131222 |doi=10.3109/10826084.2011.561722 |pmid=21692597}}</ref>\n\nEntheogen was coined as a replacement for the terms ''hallucinogen'' and ''[[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]]''. ''Hallucinogen'' was popularized by [[Aldous Huxley]]'s experiences with [[mescaline]], which were published as ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'' in 1954. ''Psychedelic'', in contrast, is a Greek neologism for \"mind manifest\", and was coined by psychiatrist [[Humphry Osmond]]; Huxley was a volunteer in experiments Osmond was conducting on mescaline.\n\nRuck et al. argued that the term ''hallucinogen'' was inappropriate owing to its etymological relationship to words relating to delirium and [[insanity]]. The term ''psychedelic'' was also seen as problematic, owing to the similarity in sound to words pertaining to [[psychosis]] and also due to the fact that it had become irreversibly associated with various connotations of 1960s [[popular culture|pop culture]]. In modern usage ''entheogen'' may be used synonymously with these terms, or it may be chosen to contrast with [[recreational drug use|recreational use]] of the same drugs. The meanings of the term ''entheogen'' were formally defined by Ruck et al.:\n\n{{quote|In a strict sense, only those vision-producing drugs that can be shown to have figured in shamanic or religious rites would be designated entheogens, but in a looser sense, the term could also be applied to other drugs, both natural and artificial, that induce alterations of consciousness similar to those documented for ritual ingestion of traditional entheogens.|Ruck et al, 1979, ''Journal of Psychedelic Drugs''<ref>\n{{Cite journal\n |author      = Carl A.

Santo Daime incorporates elements of several religious or spiritual traditions including [[Folk Catholicism]], [[Kardecist Spiritism]], African [[animism]] and [[Indigenous peoples of Brazil|indigenous]] South American [[shamanism]], including ''[[vegetalismo]]''.\n\nCeremonies&nbsp;&mdash; ''trabalhos'' (Brazilian Portuguese for \"works\")&nbsp;&mdash; are typically several hours long and are undertaken sitting in silent \"concentration\", or sung collectively, dancing according to simple steps in geometrical formation. Ayahuasca, referred to as [[Daime]] within the practice, which contains several psychoactive compounds, is drunk as part of the ceremony. The drinking of Daime can induce a strong [[vomiting|emetic]] effect which is embraced as both emotional and physical purging.\n\nSanto Daime churches promote a wholesome lifestyle in conformity with Irineu's motto of \"harmony, love, truth and justice\", as well as other key doctrinal values such as strength, humility, fraternity and purity of heart. The practice became a worldwide movement in the 1990s.\n\n=====Uni\u00e3o do Vegetal=====\nUni\u00e3o do Vegetal ({{lang-pt|Centro Esp\u00edrita Beneficente Uni\u00e3o do Vegetal|links=no}} {{IPA-pt|\u02c8s\u1ebdt\u027ew is\u02c8pi\u027eit\u0250 benefi\u02c8s\u1ebdt\u0283 uni\u02c8\u0250\u0303w du ve\u0292e\u02c8taw|}}; or '''UDV''') is a religious society founded on July 22, 1961 by Jos\u00e9 Gabriel da Costa, known as [[Mestre Gabriel]]. The translation of ''Uni\u00e3o do Vegetal'' is ''Union of the Plants'' referring to the sacrament of the UDV, Hoasca tea (also known as ayahuasca). This beverage is made by boiling two plants, Mariri ([[Banisteriopsis caapi]]) and Chacrona ([[Psychotria viridis]]), both of which are native to the Amazon rainforest.\n\nIn its sessions, UDV members drink Hoasca Tea for the effect of mental concentration.  In Brazil, the use of Hoasca in religious rituals was regulated by the Brazilian Federal Government's National Drug Policy Council on January 25, 2010.  The policy established legal norms for the religious institutions that responsibly use this tea.  The Supreme Court of the United States unanimously affirmed the UDV's right to use Hoasca tea in its religious sessions in the United States, in a decision published on February 21, 2006.\n\n=====Others=====\nEntheogens also play an important role in contemporary religious movements such as the [[Rastafari movement]] and the [[Church of the Universe]].\n\n==== Prohibition ====\nSome religions forbid, discourage, or restrict the drinking of alcoholic beverages. These include [[Islam]], [[Jainism]], the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]], the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Mormons]], the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], the [[Church of Christ, Scientist]], the [[United Pentecostal Church International]], [[Theravada]], most [[Mahayana]] schools of [[Buddhism]], some [[Protestantism|Protestant]] denominations of [[Christianity]], some sects of [[Taoism]] ([[Five Precepts (Taoism)|Five Precepts]] and [[Ten Precepts (Taoism)|Ten Precepts]]), and [[Hinduism]].\n\nThe [[Pali Canon]], the scripture of [[Theravada Buddhism]], depicts refraining from alcohol as essential to moral conduct because intoxication causes a loss of [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|mindfulness]]. The fifth of the [[Five Precepts]] states, \"''Sur\u0101-meraya-majja-pam\u0101da\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101n\u0101 verama\u1e47\u012b sikkh\u0101pada\u1e43 sam\u0101diy\u0101mi.''\" In English: \"I undertake to refrain from meraya and majja (the two fermented drinks used in the place and time of writing) to heedless intoxication.\" Although the Fifth Precept only names a specific wine and cider, this has traditionally been interpreted to mean all alcoholic beverages. Technically, this prohibition does not include light to moderate drinking, only drinking to the point of drunkenness. It also doesn't include other mind-altering drugs, but Buddhist tradition includes all intoxicants. The canon does not suggest that alcohol is evil but believes that the carelessness produced by intoxication creates bad karma. Therefore, any drug (beyond tea or mild coffee) that affects one's mindfulness be considered by some to be covered by this prohibition.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n=== Cultural use ===\n\nEntheogens have been used in various ways, e.g., as part of established religious rituals, as aids for personal spiritual development (\"plant teachers\"),<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.kentupper.com/resources/Entheogens+$26+Education--JDEA+2003.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009175718/http://www.kentupper.com/resources/Entheogens+$26+Education--JDEA+2003.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-10-09 |title=Entheogens & education: Exploring the potential of psychoactives as educational tools |author=Tupper, K.W. |journal=Journal of Drug Education and Awareness |year=2003 |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=145\u2013161 |issn=1546-6965 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.csse.ca/CJE/Articles/FullText/CJE27-4/CJE27-4-tupper.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041229092745/http://csse.ca/CJE/Articles/FullText/CJE27-4/CJE27-4-tupper.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2004-12-29 |title=Entheogens and existential intelligence: The use of plant teachers as cognitive tools |author=Tupper, K.W. |journal=Canadian Journal of Education |year=2002 |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=499\u2013516 |doi=10.2307/1602247 |jstor=1602247 }}</ref> as recreational drugs, and for medical and therapeutic use.

The first American entheogen to be subject to scientific analysis was the [[peyote]] cactus (''Lophophora williamsii''). For his part, one of the founders of modern ethno-botany, the late-[[Richard Evans Schultes]] of [[Harvard University]] documented the ritual use of peyote cactus among the [[Kiowa]], who live in what became Oklahoma. While it was used traditionally by many cultures of what is now [[Mexico]], in the 19th century its use spread throughout [[North America]], replacing the [[toxic]] [[Calia secundiflora|mescal bean]] (''Calia secundiflora''). Other well-known entheogens used by Mexican cultures include the alcoholic [[Aztec]] sacrament, [[pulque]], ritual [[tobacco]] (known as 'picietl' to the Aztecs, and 'sikar' to the [[Maya people|Maya]] (from where the word 'cigar' derives)), [[psilocybin mushroom]]s, morning glories (''[[Ipomoea tricolor]]'' and ''[[Turbina corymbosa]]''), and ''[[Salvia divinorum]]''.\n\n''[[Datura wrightii]]'' is sacred to some [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and has been used in ceremonies and [[rite of passage|rites of passage]] by Chumash, Tongva, and others. Among the Chumash, when a boy was 8 years old, his mother would give him a preparation of ''momoy'' to drink. This supposed spiritual challenge should help the boy develop the spiritual wellbeing that is required to become a man. Not all of the boys undergoing this ritual survived.<ref name=Garcia>{{cite book | author=Cecilia Garcia, James D.

For instance, during a frightening situation, such as when seeing a coyote walk like a man, a leaf of ''momoy'' was sucked to help keep the soul in the body.\n\n==== Asia ====\nThe indigenous peoples of [[Siberia]] (from whom the term ''shaman'' was borrowed) have used ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' as an entheogen.\n\nIn [[Hinduism]], ''[[Datura stramonium]]'' and cannabis have been used in religious ceremonies, although the religious use of datura is not very common, as the primary alkaloids are strong [[deliriants]], which causes serious intoxication with unpredictable effects.\n\nAlso, the ancient drink [[Soma (drink)|Soma]], mentioned often in the [[Vedas]], appears to be consistent with the effects of an entheogen. In his 1967 book, Wasson argues that Soma was ''[[Amanita muscaria]]''. The active ingredient of Soma is presumed by some to be [[ephedrine]], an alkaloid with stimulant properties derived from the soma plant, identified as ''[[Ephedra]] pachyclada''. However, there are also [[Botanical identity of soma\u2013haoma|arguments]] to suggest that Soma could have also been [[Harmal|Syrian rue]], [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], ''[[Atropa belladonna]]'', or some combination of any of the above plants.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n==== Europe ====\n\nFermented honey, known in Northern Europe as [[mead]], was an early entheogen in [[Aegean civilization]], predating the introduction of wine, which was the more familiar entheogen of the reborn [[Dionysus]] and the [[maenad]]s. Its religious uses in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] world are bound up with the [[Bee (mythology)|mythology of the bee]].\n\n[[Dacians]] were known to use cannabis in their religious and important life ceremonies, proven by discoveries of large clay pots with burnt cannabis seeds in ancient tombs and religious shrines. Also, local oral folklore and myths tell of ancient priests that dreamed with gods and walked in the smoke. Their names, as transmitted by [[Herodotus]], were \"''[[kap-no-batai]]''\" which in Dacian was supposed to mean \"the ones that walk in the clouds\".\n\nThe growth of Roman Christianity also saw the end of the two-thousand-year-old tradition of the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]], the initiation ceremony for the cult of [[Demeter]] and [[Persephone]] involving the use of a drug known as [[kykeon]]. The term 'ambrosia' is used in Greek mythology in a way that is remarkably similar to the ''Soma'' of the Hindus as well.\n\nA theory that natural occurring gases like [[ethylene]] used by inhalation may have played a role in divinatory ceremonies at [[Delphi]] in [[Classical Greece]] received popular press attention in the early 2000s, yet has not been conclusively proven.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/ethylene/ethylene_history1.shtml |title=History : Oracle at Delphi May Have Been Inhaling Ethylene Gas Fumes |work=Ethylene Vault |publisher=Erowid.org |accessdate=31 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nMushroom consumption is part of the culture of Europeans in general, with particular importance to [[Mushroom picking in Slavic culture|Slavic and Baltic peoples]].

The Therapeutic Goods Administration and federal authority had considered a motion to ban the same, but this was withdrawn in May 2012 (as DMT may still hold potential entheogenic value to native and/or religious peoples).<ref>{{cite web|title=AUSSIE DMT BAN|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/79564875/aussie-dmt-ban|publisher=connection.ebscohost.com|accessdate=21 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n==== United States ====\nIn 1963 in ''[[Sherbert v. Verner]]'' the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] established the Sherbert Test, which consists of four criteria that are used to determine if an individual's right to religious free exercise has been violated by the government. The test is as follows:\n\nFor the individual, the court must determine\n* whether the person has a claim involving a sincere religious belief, and\n* whether the government action is a substantial burden on the person's ability to act on that belief.\n\nIf these two elements are established, then the government must prove\n* that it is acting in furtherance of a \"[[compelling state interest]],\" and\n* that it has pursued that interest in the manner least restrictive, or least burdensome, to religion.\n\nThis test was eventually all-but-eliminated in ''[[Employment Division v. Smith]]'' 494 U.S. 872 (1990) which held that a \"neutral law of general applicability\" was not subject to the test. Congress resurrected it for the purposes of federal law in the federal [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]] (RFRA) of 1993.\n\nIn ''[[City of Boerne v. Flores]]'', 521 U.S. 507 (1997) RFRA was held to trespass on state sovereignty, and application of the RFRA was essentially limited to federal law enforcement. In ''[[Gonzales v. O Centro Esp\u00edrita Beneficente Uni\u00e3o do Vegetal]]'', 546 U.S. 418 (2006), a case involving only federal law, RFRA was held to permit a church's use of a DMT-containing tea for religious ceremonies.\n\nSome states have enacted [[State Religious Freedom Restoration Acts]] intended to mirror the federal RFRA's protections.\n\n=====Religious discrimination=====\n[[Peyote]] is listed by the United States DEA as a [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule I controlled substances|Schedule I]] controlled substance.  However, practitioners of the [[Native American Church|Peyote Way Church of God]], a [[Native American religion]], perceive the regulations regarding the use of peyote as [[Religious discrimination in the United States#Peyote usage|discriminating]], leading to religious discrimination issues regarding about the U.S. policy towards drugs. As the result of ''[[Peyote Way Church of God, Inc. v. Thornburgh]]'' the [[American Indian Religious Freedom Act]] of 1978 was passed.  This federal statute allow the \"Traditional Indian religious use of the peyote sacrament,\" exempting only use by Native American persons.\n\n== Classical mythology and cults ==\nAlthough entheogens are taboo and most of them are officially prohibited in Christian and Islamic societies, their ubiquity and prominence in the spiritual traditions of various other cultures is unquestioned. \"The spirit, for example, need not be chemical, as is the case with the ivy and the olive: and yet the god was felt to be within them; nor need its possession be considered something detrimental, like drugged, hallucinatory, or delusionary: but possibly instead an invitation to knowledge or whatever good the god's spirit had to offer.\"<ref name=\"Ruck and Staples\">{{cite book|last=Staples|first=Danny|title=The world of classical myth : gods and goddesses, heroines and heroes|year=1994|publisher=Carolina Academic Press|location=Durham, NC|isbn=0-89089-575-9|url=http://csp.org/chrestomathy/world_of.html|author2=Carl A.P.

However, it has also been suggested that entheogens played an important role in ancient Indo-European culture, for example by inclusion in the ritual preparations of the [[Soma (drink)|Soma]], the \"pressed juice\" that is the subject of Book 9 of the [[Rig Veda]]. Soma was ritually prepared and drunk by priests and initiates and elicited a paean in the ''Rig Veda'' that embodies the nature of an entheogen:\n\n{{quote|Splendid by Law! declaring Law, truth speaking, truthful in thy works, Enouncing faith, King Soma!... O [Soma] Pav\u0101mana (mind clarifying), place me in that deathless, undecaying world wherein the light of heaven is set, and everlasting lustre shines.... Make me immortal in that realm where happiness and transports, where joy and felicities combine...}}{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nThe [[kykeon]] that preceded initiation into the Eleusinian Mysteries is another entheogen, which was investigated (before the word was coined) by Carl Ker\u00e9nyi, in ''Eleusis: Archetypal Image of Mother and Daughter.'' Other entheogens in the Ancient Near East and the Aegean include the [[Papaver somniferum|opium poppy]], [[Datura stramonium|datura]], and the unidentified \"lotus\" (likely the [[Nymphaea caerulea|sacred blue lily]]) eaten by the Lotus-Eaters in the ''[[Odyssey]]'' and ''[[narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]]''.\n\nAccording to Ruck, Eyan, and Staples, the familiar shamanic entheogen that the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]] brought knowledge of was ''[[Amanita muscaria]]''. It could not be cultivated; thus it had to be found, which suited it to a nomadic lifestyle. When they reached the world of the Caucasus and the Aegean, the Indo-Europeans encountered [[wine]], the entheogen of [[Dionysus]], who brought it with him from his birthplace in the mythical [[Nysa (mythology)|Nysa]], when he returned to claim his Olympian birthright. The Indo-European proto-Greeks \"recognized it as the entheogen of Zeus, and their own traditions of shamanism, the Amanita and the 'pressed juice' of Soma \u2013 but better, since no longer unpredictable and wild, the way it was found among the [[Hyperborea]]ns: as befit their own assimilation of agrarian modes of life, the entheogen was now cultivable.\"<ref name=\"Ruck and Staples\" /> [[Robert Graves]], in his foreword to ''The Greek Myths,'' hypothesises that the ambrosia of various pre-[[Greeks|Hellenic]] tribes was ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' (which, based on the morphological similarity of the words amanita, amrita and ambrosia, is entirely plausible) and perhaps [[psilocybin mushroom]]s of the genus ''[[Panaeolus]]''.\n\nAmanita was [[divinity|divine]] food, according to Ruck and Staples, not something to be indulged in or sampled lightly, not something to be profaned. It was the food of the gods, their [[ambrosia]], and it mediated between the two realms. It is said that [[Tantalus]]'s crime was inviting commoners to share his [[ambrosia]].\n\n===Assassins===\n{{main|Hashshashins#Legends and folklore}}\n\nThe legends of the [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]] had much to do with the training and instruction of Nizari ''fida'is'', famed for their public missions during which they often gave their lives to eliminate adversaries.\n\nThe tales of the ''fida'is''' training collected from anti-Ismaili historians and orientalists writers were confounded and compiled in Marco Polo's account, in which he described a \"secret garden of paradise\".{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} After being drugged, the Ismaili devotees were said to be taken to a paradise-like garden filled with attractive young maidens and beautiful plants in which these ''fida'is'' would awaken.

The adjective ''entheos'' translates to English as \"full of the god, inspired, possessed\", and is the root of the English word \"[[enthusiasm]].\" The Greeks used it as a term of praise for poets and other artists. ''Genesthai'' means \"to come into being.\" Thus, an entheogen is a drug that causes one to become inspired or to experience feelings of inspiration, often in a religious or \"spiritual\" manner.<ref name=Godlaski2011>{{cite journal |author=Godlaski, Theodore M |title=The God within |journal=Substance Use and Misuse |year=2011 |volume=46 |issue=10 |pages=1217\u20131222 |doi=10.3109/10826084.2011.561722 |pmid=21692597}}</ref>\n\nEntheogen was coined as a replacement for the terms ''hallucinogen'' and ''[[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]]''. ''Hallucinogen'' was popularized by [[Aldous Huxley]]'s experiences with [[mescaline]], which were published as ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'' in 1954. ''Psychedelic'', in contrast, is a Greek neologism for \"mind manifest\", and was coined by psychiatrist [[Humphry Osmond]]; Huxley was a volunteer in experiments Osmond was conducting on mescaline.\n\nRuck et al. argued that the term ''hallucinogen'' was inappropriate owing to its etymological relationship to words relating to delirium and [[insanity]]. The term ''psychedelic'' was also seen as problematic, owing to the similarity in sound to words pertaining to [[psychosis]] and also due to the fact that it had become irreversibly associated with various connotations of 1960s [[popular culture|pop culture]]. In modern usage ''entheogen'' may be used synonymously with these terms, or it may be chosen to contrast with [[recreational drug use|recreational use]] of the same drugs. The meanings of the term ''entheogen'' were formally defined by Ruck et al.:\n\n{{quote|In a strict sense, only those vision-producing drugs that can be shown to have figured in shamanic or religious rites would be designated entheogens, but in a looser sense, the term could also be applied to other drugs, both natural and artificial, that induce alterations of consciousness similar to those documented for ritual ingestion of traditional entheogens.|Ruck et al, 1979, ''Journal of Psychedelic Drugs''<ref>\n{{Cite journal\n |author      = Carl A.

Santo Daime incorporates elements of several religious or spiritual traditions including [[Folk Catholicism]], [[Kardecist Spiritism]], African [[animism]] and [[Indigenous peoples of Brazil|indigenous]] South American [[shamanism]], including ''[[vegetalismo]]''.\n\nCeremonies&nbsp;&mdash; ''trabalhos'' (Brazilian Portuguese for \"works\")&nbsp;&mdash; are typically several hours long and are undertaken sitting in silent \"concentration\", or sung collectively, dancing according to simple steps in geometrical formation. Ayahuasca, referred to as [[Daime]] within the practice, which contains several psychoactive compounds, is drunk as part of the ceremony. The drinking of Daime can induce a strong [[vomiting|emetic]] effect which is embraced as both emotional and physical purging.\n\nSanto Daime churches promote a wholesome lifestyle in conformity with Irineu's motto of \"harmony, love, truth and justice\", as well as other key doctrinal values such as strength, humility, fraternity and purity of heart. The practice became a worldwide movement in the 1990s.\n\n=====Uni\u00e3o do Vegetal=====\nUni\u00e3o do Vegetal ({{lang-pt|Centro Esp\u00edrita Beneficente Uni\u00e3o do Vegetal|links=no}} {{IPA-pt|\u02c8s\u1ebdt\u027ew is\u02c8pi\u027eit\u0250 benefi\u02c8s\u1ebdt\u0283 uni\u02c8\u0250\u0303w du ve\u0292e\u02c8taw|}}; or '''UDV''') is a religious society founded on July 22, 1961 by Jos\u00e9 Gabriel da Costa, known as [[Mestre Gabriel]]. The translation of ''Uni\u00e3o do Vegetal'' is ''Union of the Plants'' referring to the sacrament of the UDV, Hoasca tea (also known as ayahuasca). This beverage is made by boiling two plants, Mariri ([[Banisteriopsis caapi]]) and Chacrona ([[Psychotria viridis]]), both of which are native to the Amazon rainforest.\n\nIn its sessions, UDV members drink Hoasca Tea for the effect of mental concentration.  In Brazil, the use of Hoasca in religious rituals was regulated by the Brazilian Federal Government's National Drug Policy Council on January 25, 2010.  The policy established legal norms for the religious institutions that responsibly use this tea.  The Supreme Court of the United States unanimously affirmed the UDV's right to use Hoasca tea in its religious sessions in the United States, in a decision published on February 21, 2006.\n\n=====Others=====\nEntheogens also play an important role in contemporary religious movements such as the [[Rastafari movement]] and the [[Church of the Universe]].\n\n==== Prohibition ====\nSome religions forbid, discourage, or restrict the drinking of alcoholic beverages. These include [[Islam]], [[Jainism]], the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]], the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Mormons]], the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], the [[Church of Christ, Scientist]], the [[United Pentecostal Church International]], [[Theravada]], most [[Mahayana]] schools of [[Buddhism]], some [[Protestantism|Protestant]] denominations of [[Christianity]], some sects of [[Taoism]] ([[Five Precepts (Taoism)|Five Precepts]] and [[Ten Precepts (Taoism)|Ten Precepts]]), and [[Hinduism]].\n\nThe [[Pali Canon]], the scripture of [[Theravada Buddhism]], depicts refraining from alcohol as essential to moral conduct because intoxication causes a loss of [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|mindfulness]]. The fifth of the [[Five Precepts]] states, \"''Sur\u0101-meraya-majja-pam\u0101da\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101n\u0101 verama\u1e47\u012b sikkh\u0101pada\u1e43 sam\u0101diy\u0101mi.''\" In English: \"I undertake to refrain from meraya and majja (the two fermented drinks used in the place and time of writing) to heedless intoxication.\" Although the Fifth Precept only names a specific wine and cider, this has traditionally been interpreted to mean all alcoholic beverages. Technically, this prohibition does not include light to moderate drinking, only drinking to the point of drunkenness. It also doesn't include other mind-altering drugs, but Buddhist tradition includes all intoxicants. The canon does not suggest that alcohol is evil but believes that the carelessness produced by intoxication creates bad karma. Therefore, any drug (beyond tea or mild coffee) that affects one's mindfulness be considered by some to be covered by this prohibition.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n=== Cultural use ===\n\nEntheogens have been used in various ways, e.g., as part of established religious rituals, as aids for personal spiritual development (\"plant teachers\"),<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.kentupper.com/resources/Entheogens+$26+Education--JDEA+2003.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009175718/http://www.kentupper.com/resources/Entheogens+$26+Education--JDEA+2003.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-10-09 |title=Entheogens & education: Exploring the potential of psychoactives as educational tools |author=Tupper, K.W. |journal=Journal of Drug Education and Awareness |year=2003 |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=145\u2013161 |issn=1546-6965 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.csse.ca/CJE/Articles/FullText/CJE27-4/CJE27-4-tupper.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041229092745/http://csse.ca/CJE/Articles/FullText/CJE27-4/CJE27-4-tupper.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2004-12-29 |title=Entheogens and existential intelligence: The use of plant teachers as cognitive tools |author=Tupper, K.W. |journal=Canadian Journal of Education |year=2002 |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=499\u2013516 |doi=10.2307/1602247 |jstor=1602247 }}</ref> as recreational drugs, and for medical and therapeutic use.  The use of entheogens in human cultures is nearly ubiquitous throughout recorded history.\n\nNaturally occurring entheogens such as [[psilocybin]] and [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] (in the preparation ayahuasca), were, for the most part, discovered and used by older cultures, as part of their spiritual and religious life, as plants and agents that were respected, or in some cases revered for generations and may be a tradition that predates all modern religions as a sort of proto-religious rite.\n\nOne of the most widely used entheogens is [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], [[entheogenic use of cannabis]] has been used in regions such as [[China]], [[Europe]], and [[India]], and, in some cases, for thousands of years. It has also appeared as a part of religions and cultures such as the [[Rastafari movement]], the [[Sadhus]] of [[Hinduism]], the [[Scythians]], [[Sufi]] [[Islam]], and others.\n\n==== Africa ====\n\nThe best-known entheogen-using culture of [[Africa]] is the [[Bwiti]]sts, who used a preparation of the root bark of ''[[Tabernanthe iboga]]''.<ref>[http://ibogaine.desk.nl/fernandez.html Bwiti: An Ethnography of the Religious Imagination in Africa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628094315/http://www.ibogaine.desk.nl/fernandez.html |date=28 June 2006 }} by James W.

There are many oval-shaped green leaves and no flowers.|Salvia divinorum ([[Herba de Maria]])]]\nEntheogens have played a pivotal role in the spiritual practices of most American cultures for millennia. The first American entheogen to be subject to scientific analysis was the [[peyote]] cactus (''Lophophora williamsii''). For his part, one of the founders of modern ethno-botany, the late-[[Richard Evans Schultes]] of [[Harvard University]] documented the ritual use of peyote cactus among the [[Kiowa]], who live in what became Oklahoma. While it was used traditionally by many cultures of what is now [[Mexico]], in the 19th century its use spread throughout [[North America]], replacing the [[toxic]] [[Calia secundiflora|mescal bean]] (''Calia secundiflora''). Other well-known entheogens used by Mexican cultures include the alcoholic [[Aztec]] sacrament, [[pulque]], ritual [[tobacco]] (known as 'picietl' to the Aztecs, and 'sikar' to the [[Maya people|Maya]] (from where the word 'cigar' derives)), [[psilocybin mushroom]]s, morning glories (''[[Ipomoea tricolor]]'' and ''[[Turbina corymbosa]]''), and ''[[Salvia divinorum]]''.\n\n''[[Datura wrightii]]'' is sacred to some [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and has been used in ceremonies and [[rite of passage|rites of passage]] by Chumash, Tongva, and others. Among the Chumash, when a boy was 8 years old, his mother would give him a preparation of ''momoy'' to drink. This supposed spiritual challenge should help the boy develop the spiritual wellbeing that is required to become a man. Not all of the boys undergoing this ritual survived.<ref name=Garcia>{{cite book | author=Cecilia Garcia, James D. Adams | title=Healing with medicinal plants of the west - cultural and scientific basis for their use | publisher=Abedus Press| year=2005 | isbn=0-9763091-0-6}}</ref> ''Momoy'' was also used to enhance spiritual wellbeing among adults. For instance, during a frightening situation, such as when seeing a coyote walk like a man, a leaf of ''momoy'' was sucked to help keep the soul in the body.\n\n==== Asia ====\nThe indigenous peoples of [[Siberia]] (from whom the term ''shaman'' was borrowed) have used ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' as an entheogen.\n\nIn [[Hinduism]], ''[[Datura stramonium]]'' and cannabis have been used in religious ceremonies, although the religious use of datura is not very common, as the primary alkaloids are strong [[deliriants]], which causes serious intoxication with unpredictable effects.\n\nAlso, the ancient drink [[Soma (drink)|Soma]], mentioned often in the [[Vedas]], appears to be consistent with the effects of an entheogen. In his 1967 book, Wasson argues that Soma was ''[[Amanita muscaria]]''. The active ingredient of Soma is presumed by some to be [[ephedrine]], an alkaloid with stimulant properties derived from the soma plant, identified as ''[[Ephedra]] pachyclada''. However, there are also [[Botanical identity of soma\u2013haoma|arguments]] to suggest that Soma could have also been [[Harmal|Syrian rue]], [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], ''[[Atropa belladonna]]'', or some combination of any of the above plants.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n==== Europe ====\n\nFermented honey, known in Northern Europe as [[mead]], was an early entheogen in [[Aegean civilization]], predating the introduction of wine, which was the more familiar entheogen of the reborn [[Dionysus]] and the [[maenad]]s. Its religious uses in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] world are bound up with the [[Bee (mythology)|mythology of the bee]].\n\n[[Dacians]] were known to use cannabis in their religious and important life ceremonies, proven by discoveries of large clay pots with burnt cannabis seeds in ancient tombs and religious shrines. Also, local oral folklore and myths tell of ancient priests that dreamed with gods and walked in the smoke. Their names, as transmitted by [[Herodotus]], were \"''[[kap-no-batai]]''\" which in Dacian was supposed to mean \"the ones that walk in the clouds\".\n\nThe growth of Roman Christianity also saw the end of the two-thousand-year-old tradition of the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]], the initiation ceremony for the cult of [[Demeter]] and [[Persephone]] involving the use of a drug known as [[kykeon]]. The term 'ambrosia' is used in Greek mythology in a way that is remarkably similar to the ''Soma'' of the Hindus as well.\n\nA theory that natural occurring gases like [[ethylene]] used by inhalation may have played a role in divinatory ceremonies at [[Delphi]] in [[Classical Greece]] received popular press attention in the early 2000s, yet has not been conclusively proven.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/ethylene/ethylene_history1.shtml |title=History : Oracle at Delphi May Have Been Inhaling Ethylene Gas Fumes |work=Ethylene Vault |publisher=Erowid.org |accessdate=31 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nMushroom consumption is part of the culture of Europeans in general, with particular importance to [[Mushroom picking in Slavic culture|Slavic and Baltic peoples]].

The Therapeutic Goods Administration and federal authority had considered a motion to ban the same, but this was withdrawn in May 2012 (as DMT may still hold potential entheogenic value to native and/or religious peoples).<ref>{{cite web|title=AUSSIE DMT BAN|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/79564875/aussie-dmt-ban|publisher=connection.ebscohost.com|accessdate=21 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n==== United States ====\nIn 1963 in ''[[Sherbert v. Verner]]'' the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] established the Sherbert Test, which consists of four criteria that are used to determine if an individual's right to religious free exercise has been violated by the government. The test is as follows:\n\nFor the individual, the court must determine\n* whether the person has a claim involving a sincere religious belief, and\n* whether the government action is a substantial burden on the person's ability to act on that belief.\n\nIf these two elements are established, then the government must prove\n* that it is acting in furtherance of a \"[[compelling state interest]],\" and\n* that it has pursued that interest in the manner least restrictive, or least burdensome, to religion.\n\nThis test was eventually all-but-eliminated in ''[[Employment Division v. Smith]]'' 494 U.S. 872 (1990) which held that a \"neutral law of general applicability\" was not subject to the test. Congress resurrected it for the purposes of federal law in the federal [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]] (RFRA) of 1993.\n\nIn ''[[City of Boerne v. Flores]]'', 521 U.S. 507 (1997) RFRA was held to trespass on state sovereignty, and application of the RFRA was essentially limited to federal law enforcement. In ''[[Gonzales v. O Centro Esp\u00edrita Beneficente Uni\u00e3o do Vegetal]]'', 546 U.S. 418 (2006), a case involving only federal law, RFRA was held to permit a church's use of a DMT-containing tea for religious ceremonies.\n\nSome states have enacted [[State Religious Freedom Restoration Acts]] intended to mirror the federal RFRA's protections.\n\n=====Religious discrimination=====\n[[Peyote]] is listed by the United States DEA as a [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule I controlled substances|Schedule I]] controlled substance.  However, practitioners of the [[Native American Church|Peyote Way Church of God]], a [[Native American religion]], perceive the regulations regarding the use of peyote as [[Religious discrimination in the United States#Peyote usage|discriminating]], leading to religious discrimination issues regarding about the U.S. policy towards drugs. As the result of ''[[Peyote Way Church of God, Inc. v. Thornburgh]]'' the [[American Indian Religious Freedom Act]] of 1978 was passed.  This federal statute allow the \"Traditional Indian religious use of the peyote sacrament,\" exempting only use by Native American persons.\n\n== Classical mythology and cults ==\nAlthough entheogens are taboo and most of them are officially prohibited in Christian and Islamic societies, their ubiquity and prominence in the spiritual traditions of various other cultures is unquestioned. \"The spirit, for example, need not be chemical, as is the case with the ivy and the olive: and yet the god was felt to be within them; nor need its possession be considered something detrimental, like drugged, hallucinatory, or delusionary: but possibly instead an invitation to knowledge or whatever good the god's spirit had to offer.\"<ref name=\"Ruck and Staples\">{{cite book|last=Staples|first=Danny|title=The world of classical myth : gods and goddesses, heroines and heroes|year=1994|publisher=Carolina Academic Press|location=Durham, NC|isbn=0-89089-575-9|url=http://csp.org/chrestomathy/world_of.html|author2=Carl A.P.

However, it has also been suggested that entheogens played an important role in ancient Indo-European culture, for example by inclusion in the ritual preparations of the [[Soma (drink)|Soma]], the \"pressed juice\" that is the subject of Book 9 of the [[Rig Veda]]. Soma was ritually prepared and drunk by priests and initiates and elicited a paean in the ''Rig Veda'' that embodies the nature of an entheogen:\n\n{{quote|Splendid by Law! declaring Law, truth speaking, truthful in thy works, Enouncing faith, King Soma!... O [Soma] Pav\u0101mana (mind clarifying), place me in that deathless, undecaying world wherein the light of heaven is set, and everlasting lustre shines.... Make me immortal in that realm where happiness and transports, where joy and felicities combine...}}{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nThe [[kykeon]] that preceded initiation into the Eleusinian Mysteries is another entheogen, which was investigated (before the word was coined) by Carl Ker\u00e9nyi, in ''Eleusis: Archetypal Image of Mother and Daughter.'' Other entheogens in the Ancient Near East and the Aegean include the [[Papaver somniferum|opium poppy]], [[Datura stramonium|datura]], and the unidentified \"lotus\" (likely the [[Nymphaea caerulea|sacred blue lily]]) eaten by the Lotus-Eaters in the ''[[Odyssey]]'' and ''[[narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]]''.\n\nAccording to Ruck, Eyan, and Staples, the familiar shamanic entheogen that the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]] brought knowledge of was ''[[Amanita muscaria]]''. It could not be cultivated; thus it had to be found, which suited it to a nomadic lifestyle. When they reached the world of the Caucasus and the Aegean, the Indo-Europeans encountered [[wine]], the entheogen of [[Dionysus]], who brought it with him from his birthplace in the mythical [[Nysa (mythology)|Nysa]], when he returned to claim his Olympian birthright. The Indo-European proto-Greeks \"recognized it as the entheogen of Zeus, and their own traditions of shamanism, the Amanita and the 'pressed juice' of Soma \u2013 but better, since no longer unpredictable and wild, the way it was found among the [[Hyperborea]]ns: as befit their own assimilation of agrarian modes of life, the entheogen was now cultivable.\"<ref name=\"Ruck and Staples\" /> [[Robert Graves]], in his foreword to ''The Greek Myths,'' hypothesises that the ambrosia of various pre-[[Greeks|Hellenic]] tribes was ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' (which, based on the morphological similarity of the words amanita, amrita and ambrosia, is entirely plausible) and perhaps [[psilocybin mushroom]]s of the genus ''[[Panaeolus]]''.\n\nAmanita was [[divinity|divine]] food, according to Ruck and Staples, not something to be indulged in or sampled lightly, not something to be profaned. It was the food of the gods, their [[ambrosia]], and it mediated between the two realms. It is said that [[Tantalus]]'s crime was inviting commoners to share his [[ambrosia]].\n\n===Assassins===\n{{main|Hashshashins#Legends and folklore}}\n\nThe legends of the [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]] had much to do with the training and instruction of Nizari ''fida'is'', famed for their public missions during which they often gave their lives to eliminate adversaries.\n\nThe tales of the ''fida'is''' training collected from anti-Ismaili historians and orientalists writers were confounded and compiled in Marco Polo's account, in which he described a \"secret garden of paradise\".{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} After being drugged, the Ismaili devotees were said to be taken to a paradise-like garden filled with attractive young maidens and beautiful plants in which these ''fida'is'' would awaken.

He is the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] son of [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]] and [[Gabrielle Haller]]. Legion takes the role of an [[antihero]] who has a severe mental illness including a form of [[dissociative identity disorder]]. \n\nThe television series [[Legion (TV series)|''Legion'']] premiered on [[FX (TV channel)|FX network]] in 2017. The lead character was portrayed by [[Dan Stevens]]. The series is developed, written, directed, and produced by [[Noah Hawley]].\n\n==Publication history==\n{{expand section|date=March 2017}}\nCreated by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Bill Sienkiewicz]], Legion made his debut in ''[[New Mutants]]'' #25 (March 1985).\n\nIn 1991, Legion was assigned to be a co-starring character in the newly revamped ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'', as a member of the eponymous superteam. However, writer [[Peter David]] was uncomfortable with this, and ultimately editor [[Bob Harras]] independently came to the conclusion that Legion should not be used in the series. David explained \"I don't mind building a story around [Legion], but working him into a group - you're really asking for a bit much from the reader. Believing that a group of people will come together to form a team is enough of a suspension of disbelief... 'Oh, by the way, one of them is so nuts he shouldn't be setting foot off [[Muir Island]]'... that's asking the reader to bend so far he will break.\"<ref>{{cite news | last = O'Neill | first = Patrick Daniel | date = February 1992 | title = Peter David | work = [[Comics Interview]] | issue = 105 | pages = 19\u201320 | publisher = [[Fictioneer Books]]|issn=1052-5548}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nWhile working in an [[Israel]]i psychiatric facility, [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] met a patient named [[Gabrielle Haller]]. The two had an affair that, after an amicable end and unbeknownst to Xavier, ultimately resulted in the birth of their son David (Gabrielle had not told Xavier she was pregnant).<ref>''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #161 and ''[[New Mutants]]'' vol. 1 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDavid, at a young age, was living with his mother and stepfather in Paris when his home was attacked by terrorists and his stepfather killed. The trauma of the situation caused an initial manifestation of David's mutant powers, as David incinerated the minds of the terrorists. In the process, he unintentionally absorbed the mind of the terrorist leader, Jemail Karami, into his own. Being linked to so many others at their time of death, David was rendered [[catatonia|catatonic]] for years. As he slowly recovered, he was moved to the care of [[Moira MacTaggert]] at the [[Muir Island]] mutant research facility. The trauma (possibly in conjunction with the nature of his reality-altering powers) had caused David's psyche to splinter into multiple personalities, each personality manifesting different mutant abilities.<ref name=\"New\">''New Mutants'' #27. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe Karami personality, which manifested telepathic abilities, struggled for years to separate his consciousness from David's. In the process, Karami reintegrated many of the splintered personalities back into David's core personality (thus ending David's catatonia). Some of the personalities resisted Karami, most notably Jack Wayne, a swaggering adventurer who was [[psychokinesis|telekinetic]], and Cyndi, a temperamental, rebellious girl who was [[pyrokinesis|pyrokinetic]]. Ultimately Karami, Wayne, and Cyndi continued to exist as David's most prominent alternate personalities.<ref>''[[New Mutants]]'' vol. 1 #26-28. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring his time at Muir Island, David saved Moira and [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]] from a fatal accident by accessing the telekinetic abilities of his Jack Wayne personality. However, this allowed Jack Wayne to take control of David's body, and he left the island. The [[New Mutants]] tracked him down and, after a struggle, convinced Wayne to allow David to again assume control.<ref>''[[New Mutants]]'' vol. 1 #44. Marvel Comics.</ref> Soon after, David was possessed by the [[Shadow King]]. While under the Shadow King's influence, David killed the mutant [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]] and destroyed 2/3 of the island. When the [[X-Men]] and [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] defeated the Shadow King, David was again left in a coma.<ref>[[Muir Island Saga]], involving ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #278-280 and ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' #69-70. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Legion Quest/Age of Apocalypse===\nYears later, David awoke from his coma believing his psyche fully healed. When he had killed the mutant [[precognition|precog]] Destiny, David had absorbed her psyche. Destiny gave David vague prophetic guidance about the great world that could exist \"if only, years ago, [[Professor X]] had been given a real chance to fulfill his dream.\"<ref>''X-Men vol. 2'' #38. Marvel Comics.</ref> David, who despite his belief was not sane, understood these words as a directive to travel back in time and kill [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]], Xavier's greatest adversary, to allow his father Professor X achieve the dream of human-mutant coexistence. \n\nAs several X-Men attempted to stop him, Legion traveled twenty years into the past, accidentally dragging the X-Men with him. David appeared in the past in front of Xavier and Magneto, who at the time were orderlies in a mental hospital. As Legion attacked Magneto, the X-Men intervened. After overpowering the X-Men, Legion readied his fatal blow for Magneto, but Xavier leaped in front of the lethal psychic attack and was himself killed. By accidentally killing his father, the horrified David prevented his own birth and ceased to exist. The death of Xavier created a catastrophic alternate timeline, the [[Age of Apocalypse]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Dreams Die!|journal=X-Men|date=February 1995|volume=2|series=Legion Quest|issue=41}}</ref> \n\nUltimately, [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] managed to fix the timeline by enlisting the aid of the new reality's X-Men to travel back in time to the moment of Xavier's murder. There Bishop confronted Legion, using David's own power to create a psionic loop that showed the young mutant the damage that his actions would cause. David allowed the energy released in this process to incinerate him, in his last moments apologizing for what he had done.\"<ref>''X-Men Omega'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> \n\nWhile David was considered deceased, some of his alternate personalities manifested as spirits and started terrorizing Israel (where David had been born). [[Excalibur_(comics)|Excalibur]] was called to stop them. Ultimately [[Meggan]] used her empathy to calm their rage, convincing them to go \"towards the light.\"<ref>''Excalibur (1st series)'' #121. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Return===\nDavid had in fact not died; rather, his mind manifested in Otherplace, a timeless interdimensional limbo. When Bishop had turned Legion's psychic power back on him, it devastated David's mental landscape, undoing all the healing efforts of Karami and Professor Xavier. David now had thousands of personalities vying for control in his mind. David wandered through Otherplace for an untold period of time, trying to make his way back home.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Magik_(Illyana_Rasputin)|Magik]], a mutant able to travel across dimensions, reached out and contacted one of David's personalities, \"The Legion,\" who could alter reality at a cosmic scale (this incredibly powerful personality claimed to be the \"real\" David, although it was distinct from David's core personality).<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #20.

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDavid re-manifested in the physical world, although his core David personality had been imprisoned in his mindscape by his other personalities, allowing the more malicious personalities to take turns controlling his body. One of these personalities killed and absorbed the mind of a young girl, Marci Sobol, who became another personality within Legion. David was discovered by the New Mutants as they investigated a possible mutant case in [[Westcliffe, Colorado]].<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> David absorbed [[Karma (comics)|Karma]] and [[Magik_(Illyana_Rasputin)|Magik]] into his mind. As the rest of the team fought a losing battle against various personalities that seized control of Legion's body, in his mindscape Karma and Magik destroyed other hostile personalities. Eventually they found the Marci personality, who led them to David's imprisoned core self. By freeing David and helping him reassert control, Karma and Magik saved the rest of the team and were restored to their bodies.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> David was detained by the X-Men and put in the care of Professor X, [[Doctor Nemesis]], [[Danger (comics)|Danger]], and [[Rogue_(comics)|Rogue]].<ref name=\"New Mutants, vol. 3 #5\">''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWeeks later, Magik managed to bring the Elder Gods back to Earth, planning to have her revenge on them. The Elder Gods manifested, causing catastrophic destruction, and appeared ready to lay waste to the world. As the various mutant teams tried to stop this apocalypse, Magik sent her ally Karma to free Legion and awaken \"The Legion\" personality to fulfill its bargain. The Legion, who Magik called \"The God Mutant,\" appeared and altered reality to wipe the Elder Gods from existence and reset the world to a time before they had manifested.<ref name=\"''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #21. Marvel Comics.\"/>  After this, David's core personality returned and he was taken back into the care and treatment of the X-Men.\n\n===Age of X===\nBelieving that David's psyche would be healed if his alternate personalities were quarantined, [[Doctor Nemesis]] began to catalog and contain these personalities within David's mind. Unbeknownst to Doctor Nemesis and Professor Xavier, however, David's mind subconsciously perceived this intervention as a threat and created a \"psychic antibody,\" a powerful new personality, to defend itself. The new personality had access to a degree of David's underlying ability to alter reality and time. Assuming the appearance of the deceased Moira McTaggert (considered a mother figure by David due to his time under her care at Muir Island), the personality attempted to 'protect' Legion from the 'assault' on his mind by creating a [[Pocket_universe|pocket reality]] where Legion was the hero that he always wanted to be.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy #244. Marvel Comics.</ref> Many members of various X-teams were also brought into this new reality, which existed separately from [[Earth-616|Marvel's primary continuity]].<ref>''X-Men: Legacy #247. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe alternate pocket reality, the [[Age of X]], was a dystopia in which mutants had been hunted almost to extinction; the remaining mutants were kept alive by Legion's mutant team, who daily generated a force wall to repel attacking human forces. Legion himself remained unaware that one of his personalities had created this world, and most of the mutants who had been brought into the reality by 'Moira' believed that they had always been there. Within this pocket reality the 'Moira' personality was practically omnipotent, creating and controlling random soldiers for Legion and the other mutants to kill. Eventually, Legacy, the alternate [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], discovered that 'Moira' had in fact created this reality. Confronted with this truth, Legion spoke to 'Moira,' who tearfully offered to create as many universes for him as he wanted. Instead, David absorbed 'Moira' back into himself and erased the Age of X reality, restoring its participants to [[Earth-616]] reality; ultimately, this entire timeline had lasted seven days in their normal continuity.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #245-248; ''New Mutants'' Vol. 3 #22-23. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Lost Legions===\nWith the Age of X incident underscoring the potentially apocalyptic scope of David's power, Professor X proposed a new approach to help Legion retain control of himself. Instead of isolating David from the other personalities in his mind, Professor X suggested that he learn to co-exist with them. To this end, Doctor Nemesis, Madison Jeffries and Reed Richards designed a Neural Switchboard Wristband for David. This switchboard assigned unique numbers to different Legion personalities. When David entered a number, the device stimulated cells in his thalamus and neocortex, creating a one-way link between David's core personality and the alternate personality he had selected. This allowed Legion to access the power of that personality for several seconds without being overwhelmed by it. While testing the device, Legion discovered that six of his personalities were no longer in his mind, but had \"escaped,\" manifesting separately from him in the real world.<ref name=\"X-Men: Legacy #249\">''X-Men: Legacy'' #249. Marvel Comics.</ref> With a team of X-Men, Legion tracked down and reabsorbed all of these rogue personas. While absorbing the last one, he accidentally absorbed Rogue along with it, and, after releasing her, David suffered a massive shock to his nervous system. Rogue stated that, while she was inside Legion, she was connected to thousands of types of powers and there were more being born all the time.<ref name=\"X-Men: Legacy #253\">''X-Men: Legacy'' #253. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===The Fiend===\nTo aid his recovery, Professor X left Legion with Merzah the Mystic, a powerful empath and telepath who ran a Himalayan monastery. While at the monastery, David gained much greater control of himself, and he stopped using the Neural Switchboard Wristband. Under Merzah's tutelage, David learned to visualize a facility in his mind where his alternate personalities could be kept and controlled.<ref name=\"X-Men: Legacy Vol. 2 #1\">''X-Men: Legacy'' Vol. 2 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, while David was at the monastery, elsewhere in the world Professor X was killed. When Legion sensed this, the mental shock caused a catastrophic release of energy that killed Merzah and everyone else at the monastery.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' Vol. 2 #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> In addition, without knowing it, David subconsciously created a new personality, The Fiend. This personality was able to kill other personalities in his mind, absorbing their powers in the process.\n\nIn the final issue of ''X-Men: Legacy'', Legion, reaching the full extent of his powers, decided to erase himself from existence.<ref name=\"X-Men: Legacy #24\">''X-Men: Legacy'' Vol.2 #24. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Trauma===\nFor unknown reasons (perhaps elements of his own psyche working against him), Legion's attempt to erase himself from existence failed. When he reappeared, David's mind was again fragmented into many personalities, including a malicious new personality, \"Lord Trauma.\" Lord Trauma aimed to take over David's mind and body by absorbing all of David's other personalities. In a desperate attempt to save himself, David sought out the help of renowned young psychotherapist Hannah Jones to delve into his fractured mind and fight back this dark personality.<ref name=\"Legion 1\">''Legion'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> While Jones was ultimately able to help Legion defeat Trauma, she remained trapped in David's psyche (her body in a [[Persistent_vegetative_state|vegetative coma]]). To thank Jones, Legion placed her psyche into a dream state/alternate reality where she achieved her biggest goals.<ref name=\"Legion 5\">''Legion'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n=== X-Men Break Up ===\nAs the X-Men race around the globe to fight the temporal anomalies that have been springing up and to corral the hundreds of Madrox duplicates wreaking havoc, Legion arrives at the X-Mansion, seemingly in control of his powers and psyche. While the young X-Men try to ascertain what he wants, elsewhere Jean Grey and Psylocke team up to psychically purge whatever force is controlling the army of Madrox duplicates. Finding the prime Madrox imprisoned below the area where the army of duplicates are congregating, he explains that Legion imprisoned him and implanted his numerous personalities and powers across the hundreds of duplicates. However, with his control broken, Legion goes berserk in the mansion, attacking the young X-Men and ranting about a vision of the future. The rest of the X-Men arrive to help but Legion singlehandedly takes on the whole team until he and Jean Grey go head-to-head. Legion then explains that he's trying to prevent a vision of the future - the arrival of the Horsemen of Salvation - but just as Legion mentions them, the Horsemen arrive.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' (2018) #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n[[File:XMEN-LegionPowers.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Doctor Nemesis]], [[Blindfold (comics)|Blindfold]], and [[Professor X]] among Legion's alters.]]\nLegion is an [[Omega-level mutant]]<ref name=\"New Mutants, vol. 3 #4\">''New Mutants, vol. 3'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> who has [[dissociative identity disorder|multiple personalities]]. Fundamentally, he has the ability to alter reality and time on a cosmic scale at will,<ref name=\"X-Men: Legacy #24\"/> but due to his multiple personalities, in practice his abilities vary depending on the dominant personality: each alter has different powers enabled by David's subconscious manipulation of reality. The core personality, David Haller himself, generally does not manifest mutant abilities, but must access various personalities to use their power, sometimes losing control of himself to that personality. Some of Legion's personalities physically transform his body (e.g., manifesting a prehensile tongue, becoming a woman, transforming into a werewolf, etc.). The first alter to manifest, Jemail Karami, was [[telepathy|telepathic]].  Other prominent alters include Jack Wayne ([[psychokinesis|telekinetic]]) and Cyndi ([[pyrokinesis|pyrokinetic]]). Legion has over a thousand different personalities (the exact number is unknown), and his mind can create additional alters in response to external or internal events.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #254</ref>\n\nThe cumulative abilities of all his personalities make him one of the most powerful mutants in existence, if not the most powerful.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' vol. 2 #6.</ref> Since the abilities of his personalities stem from his subconscious alteration of reality, Legion is theoretically capable of manifesting any power he can imagine. In two instances David has manifested the full extent of his ability to alter time and reality: in the first, he wiped the Elder Gods from existence and reset the universe to a state before the Elder Gods first appeared on Earth,<ref>''New Mutants, vol. 3'' #20-21. Marvel Comics.</ref> and in the other he observed the entirety of spacetime and mended damage his personalities had done to it.<ref name=\"X-Men: Legacy #24\"/>\n\nLegion can absorb other people's psyches into his mind, either intentionally or, if he is next to them when they die, unintentionally.<ref name=\"New Mutants, vol. 3 #5\"/> Conversely, in several instances Legion has had personalities manifest and act separately from him (or even against him) in the physical world; in most instances Legion has ultimately reabsorbed these personalities back into himself. Presumably, both his absorption of other psyches and the physical manifestations of his own personalities are enabled by Legion's underlying ability to alter reality/time at will.\n\nGenerally, David's ability to access and control his personalities/powers is closely tied to his self confidence and self esteem: the better he feels about himself, the more control he exercises. Unfortunately, David often suffers from self-doubt and self-recrimination, meaning that he must struggle to remain in control. Following the Age of X, David briefly used a Neural Switchboard Wristband engineered by [[Doctor Nemesis]], [[Madison Jeffries]], and [[Reed Richards]]. This device allowed Legion to utilize a personality's power set for several seconds without being overwhelmed by that personality. However, he soon abandoned this and attempted instead to develop a more organic control over his personalities.<ref name=\"X-Men: Legacy Vol. 2 #1\"/>\n\n===Personalities===\nThe following characters are different personalities of Legion that have appeared thus far, each one manifesting different powers:\n\n* Through the personality of terrorist '''Jemail Karami''' (the name given to Personality #2), he has manifested [[telepathy]].<ref>''New Mutants'' #26. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n* Through the personality of roustabout adventurer '''Jack Wayne''' (the name given to Personality #3), he has manifested [[psychokinesis|telekinesis]].<ref name=\"New\" /> This personality was often quite dangerous and would not hesitate to hurt or kill others if it would allow him to remain independent/free from David's control.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Eventually, Jack Wayne was subsumed by a different, malevolent Legion personality, '''Lord Trauma.'''<ref>''Legion'' #1-5. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n* Through the personality of the rebellious girl '''Cyndi''' (the name given to Personality #4), he has manifested [[pyrokinesis]]. This personality of Legion has a crush on [[Cypher (Marvel Comics)|Cypher]].<ref name=\"New\"/>\n* Through the personality of '''The Legion''' (the name given to Personality #5, which claims to be Legion's \"real me\"), he can warp time and reality. [[Magik_(Illyana_Rasputin)|Magik]] nicknamed this personality the \"God-Mutant.\"<ref name=\"''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #21.

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n* Through '''Personality #181''', he can enlarge himself to an undetermined size. This was the first power Legion utilized with the Neural Switchboard Wristband.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #248. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n* Through the personality of '''Johnny Gomorrah''' (the name given to Personality #186), he can transmute his enemies and objects into salt.<ref name=\"X-Men: Legacy #249\"/>\n* Through the personality of '''Time-Sink''' (the name given to Personality #227), he has the ability of time-manipulation.<ref name=\"X-Men: Legacy #253\"/> This rebellious personality was able to become independent from David but was eventually found and reabsorbed by David.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' Vol. 1 #250. Marvel Comics.</ref> David was ultimately forced to stop using Time-Sink's powers because when David tried to access the personality, it would always fight to get back its freedom.<ref name=\"X-Men: Legacy #253\"/>\n* Through '''Personality #302''', he can move at supersonic speeds.<ref name=\"X-Men: Legacy #253\"/>\n* Through the personality of '''Styx''' (the name given to Personality #666), he has the ability to absorb the consciousness of anyone he touches, turning that person's body into a shell that he can then control. The possessed individual can still access any special abilities they have, and there does not appear to be a limit to the number of individuals simultaneously controlled.<ref name=\"X-Men: Legacy #251\"/> David considers this manipulative personality his most dangerous, because it is clever, cruel, and extremely ambitious.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' Vol. 1 #252. Marvel Comics.</ref> Styx was able to become independent from Legion, manifesting as a desiccated corpse, and tried to take control of Legion himself, so that he could use Legion's reality-altering powers to remake the world according to his will. Legion, using the power of his '''Chain''' personality, managed to trick and reabsorb Styx.<ref name=\"X-Men: Legacy #253\"/>\n* Through '''Personality #762''', he becomes a [[Piracy|pirate]] with the ability to belch an acidic gas.\n* Through '''Personality #898''', he becomes a [[centaur]].\n* Through the personality of '''Delphic''' (the name given to Personality #1012), he becomes a blue-skinned, seemingly-omniscient female seer who will answer any three questions from supplicants.<ref name=\"X-Men: Legacy #249\"/>\n\nLegion personalities that have not been assigned numbers include:\n\n* '''Absence''', an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]]/[[demon]] creature with its eyes sewn shut who claims to have traveled through different realities and who can siphon off heat and love.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n* '''Bleeding Image''', a living voodoo doll who can redirect and amplify the pain from any injury he inflicts on himself onto his victims. As he notes, \"How much must David hate himself, to have imagined me?\" This malicious personality was able to become independent from David but he was eventually found and stated to have been destroyed by Magneto.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #252. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n* '''Chain''', effectively a human virus who turns anyone he touches into a copy of himself with a new weapon. The power dissipates when the original is dealt with. This personality was able to become independent from David but he was eventually found and reabsorbed by David.<ref name=\"X-Men: Legacy #251\">''X-Men: Legacy'' #251. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n* '''Chronodon''', a [[dinosaur]] with a clock on its face. Based on its name and appearance, it can be assumed that it can manipulate time in some way.\n* '''[[Clown]]''', a surly-looking clown that can blast energy from his mouth.\n* '''Compass Rose''', who can locate any person and teleport to them.\n* '''The Delusionaut''', a train engineer with a billow stack for a head who uses the smoke that he exudes to create illusions so convincing that they fool even powerful telepaths such as [[Emma Frost]]. He manifested outside of Legion to help him at one point, and eventually was one of the personalities that volunteered to meld together to form '''Gestalt'''.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' vol. 2 #20.</ref> \n* '''Drexel''', a foul-mouthed simpleton with super-strength.\n* '''Endgame''', huge and aggressive armor that instantly manifests the perfect counter to any attack executed against it (for example, becoming intangible, manifesting super strength, transmuting its material from metal to wood to defeat Magneto, etc.). This personality became independent from David, but it was eventually found and reabsorbed by David.<ref name=\"X-Men: Legacy #253\"/>\n* '''The Fiend/\"Charles Xavier\"''', a dangerous personality David created following the mental shock of the death of his father, Professor X. The Fiend manifests as either a yellow [[goblin]]-like creature or in the guise of Professor X; it has significant psychic abilities, including [[precognition]] and [[Spirit_possession|possession]], and can kill other Legion personalities in Legion's mind, absorbing their power.<ref name=\"Legion 1\"/> Eventually, the Fiend became independent from David and tried to help him retain more control of himself.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' vol. 2 #6.</ref>\n* '''Findel the Finder''', who can find anyone across the galaxy.\n* '''Gestalt''', a powerful fusion of several Legion personalities with the core personality of David himself, allowing the abilities of these personalities to manifest simultaneously under David's control. Legion created Gestalt to successfully repel an attack on his mind.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' vol. 2 #24. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n* '''Hugh Davidson''', a stereotypical prepster with a long prehensile tongue.\n* '''Hunter''', a macho-man personality David's mind created to replace Jack Wayne, when that personality was subsumed by the Lord Trauma personality.\n* '''Hypnobloke''', a gentleman with flashing swirls for eyes who wears a top hat and carries a pocket watch.

Marvel Comics.</ref> \n* '''Mycolojester''', a [[plant]]-like entity with the attire of a [[jester]], who can emit toxic spores from his skin.

He escapes his mother's [[Muir Island|facility]], looking for his father, and murders hundreds to discredit him.

Alternate versions of [[Unuscione]], [[Hellion (Marvel Comics)|Hellion]], [[Rachel Summers]], Legion, and [[Psylocke]]]]\nIn the ''[[Age of X]]'' reality, Legion leads the Force Warriors, a select group of telekinetics who rebuild the \"Force Walls\" (telekinetic shields that protect Fortress X) on a daily basis to protect mutants from human attacks. Unlike his 616 counterpart, there is no trace of the other personalities shown. It is ultimately revealed that the Age of X reality was unconsciously created by Legion himself. A flashback reveals that in the 616 universe Professor X was arguing with [[Dr. Nemesis]] regarding the latter's containment and deletion of Legion's other personalities in an effort to stabilize him. While Dr. Nemesis claimed that everything was going according to his plan, Professor X was unconvinced and entered Legion's mind. There he found the other personalities dead and their rotting corpses left in their containment units. This surprised Dr. Nemesis, who had thought that when a personality was deleted it should simply disappear. Professor X was then attacked by what he called a \"psychic antibody,\" a personality Legion had subconsciously created to defend against Nemesis's deleting of the personalities. To overcome Professor X on the psychic plane, this personality took on the face of Moira MacTaggart and claimed that it would make a world where Legion could be happy. The 'Moira' personality then reshaped Utopia into Fortress X and inserted itself as Moira and the supercomputer X. When finally confronted about its actions, the personality made the Force walls fall, allowing the human armies to attack. 'Moira' announced her intention to destroy the 616 universe as well as the Age of X and to create a new safe place for David to live happily forever. Instead, David absorbed her and reverted the Fortress X to the normal reality, with a few modifications.<ref>''New Mutants'' Vol. 3 #24.

Legion's backstory remains mostly unchanged, although David Haller is a fairly normal blonde teenager with no visible mutant powers. In the episode, David appears to be kidnapped by a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[punk subculture|punk]] named '''Lucas''', but in reality Lucas and David are one and the same. David's body can somehow change to match whichever of his multiple personalities is dominant, with personality and body shifts sometimes happening at random. The mechanism behind this ability is never fully explained, although it is possible that David is using strong psionic abilities to alter people's perception of his appearance rather than actually changing as [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]] had done when first trying to avoid being discovered. His personalities sometimes appeared in two places at once, supporting the control-of-perception theory. Only three personalities were shown. As David has no obvious powers of his own, Lucas possesses telepathic and telekinetic powers, as well as pyrokinetics while '''Ian''', the third personality, is a young mute boy who is also a pyrokinetic. As Lucas is shown capable of both telepathic and pyrokinetic powers, it is possible the Lucas persona may have access to the powers of other personalities (if any beyond these three exist). Lucas lured Professor X to Scotland and tricked him into locking David's other personalities away, leaving Lucas free to be himself. It was never explained what Lucas's goals were after this, as the show has stopped production before his storyline could be further explored.\n* Legion is mentioned in ''[[Marvel Anime|Marvel Anime: X-Men]]''. He is the root cause of something called \"Damon-Hall Syndrome\". This condition affects mutants that develop a secondary mutation causing multiple personalities, uncontrolled physical mutation, and psychological instability. There is a vaccine which Beast created to stop its progress. It should also be mentioned that one of the main antagonists of the series named '''Takeo Sasaki''' (voiced by [[Atsushi Abe]] in the Japanese version and by [[Steve Staley]] in the English Dub) is the son of Professor X and [[Moira MacTaggert|Yui Sasaki]] (a scientist in mutant research). This character is similar to Legion in many ways except for design and name, and is also similar to [[Proteus (Marvel Comics)|Proteus]] in terms of his reality-warping powers. He attended his mother's school for mutants where he was a classmate of [[Armor (comics)|Hisako Ichiki]] and an incident with Takeo being picked on by the other children resulted in a fire that burned the nearby neighborhood and had included a small burn on Hisako's hand. [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]] planned to use a near-comatose Takeo to warp reality so that the mutants can rule the world. Takeo's powers go out of control enough for him to kill Mastermind and for the entire facility he was in to collapse as he emerges as a colossal energy being. Learning that Takeo hates him for being born into a world where his powers cause him so much suffering, Professor X blames himself for causing Takeo pain. The X-Men try to attack Takeo, but are easily defeated. Professor X then prepares to destroy Takeo's mind and kill him, fully intending to die along with his son. Jean's presence manages to revive the X-Men and give them courage to fight on against. Hisako recalls her friendly past with Takeo and insists that Takeo is a good person who can be saved. Her feelings cause her armor to generate a brilliant light, reaching Takeo and bringing him back to his senses. He and Charles are able to reconcile and Takeo's body is destroyed. Before his death, Takeo is able to reassure Yui and Charles that he is all right.\n\n==Collected Editions==\n\n===X-Men Legacy===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Title !! Material collected !!

He is the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] son of [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]] and [[Gabrielle Haller]]. Legion takes the role of an [[antihero]] who has a severe mental illness including a form of [[dissociative identity disorder]]. \n\nThe television series [[Legion (TV series)|''Legion'']] premiered on [[FX (TV channel)|FX network]] in 2017. The lead character was portrayed by [[Dan Stevens]]. The series is developed, written, directed, and produced by [[Noah Hawley]].\n\n==Publication history==\n{{expand section|date=March 2017}}\nCreated by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Bill Sienkiewicz]], Legion made his debut in ''[[New Mutants]]'' #25 (March 1985).\n\nIn 1991, Legion was assigned to be a co-starring character in the newly revamped ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'', as a member of the eponymous superteam. However, writer [[Peter David]] was uncomfortable with this, and ultimately editor [[Bob Harras]] independently came to the conclusion that Legion should not be used in the series. David explained \"I don't mind building a story around [Legion], but working him into a group - you're really asking for a bit much from the reader. Believing that a group of people will come together to form a team is enough of a suspension of disbelief... 'Oh, by the way, one of them is so nuts he shouldn't be setting foot off [[Muir Island]]'... that's asking the reader to bend so far he will break.\"<ref>{{cite news | last = O'Neill | first = Patrick Daniel | date = February 1992 | title = Peter David | work = [[Comics Interview]] | issue = 105 | pages = 19\u201320 | publisher = [[Fictioneer Books]]|issn=1052-5548}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nWhile working in an [[Israel]]i psychiatric facility, [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] met a patient named [[Gabrielle Haller]]. The two had an affair that, after an amicable end and unbeknownst to Xavier, ultimately resulted in the birth of their son David (Gabrielle had not told Xavier she was pregnant).<ref>''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #161 and ''[[New Mutants]]'' vol. 1 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDavid, at a young age, was living with his mother and stepfather in Paris when his home was attacked by terrorists and his stepfather killed. The trauma of the situation caused an initial manifestation of David's mutant powers, as David incinerated the minds of the terrorists. In the process, he unintentionally absorbed the mind of the terrorist leader, Jemail Karami, into his own. Being linked to so many others at their time of death, David was rendered [[catatonia|catatonic]] for years. As he slowly recovered, he was moved to the care of [[Moira MacTaggert]] at the [[Muir Island]] mutant research facility. The trauma (possibly in conjunction with the nature of his reality-altering powers) had caused David's psyche to splinter into multiple personalities, each personality manifesting different mutant abilities.<ref name=\"New\">''New Mutants'' #27. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe Karami personality, which manifested telepathic abilities, struggled for years to separate his consciousness from David's. In the process, Karami reintegrated many of the splintered personalities back into David's core personality (thus ending David's catatonia). Some of the personalities resisted Karami, most notably Jack Wayne, a swaggering adventurer who was [[psychokinesis|telekinetic]], and Cyndi, a temperamental, rebellious girl who was [[pyrokinesis|pyrokinetic]]. Ultimately Karami, Wayne, and Cyndi continued to exist as David's most prominent alternate personalities.<ref>''[[New Mutants]]'' vol. 1 #26-28. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring his time at Muir Island, David saved Moira and [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]] from a fatal accident by accessing the telekinetic abilities of his Jack Wayne personality. However, this allowed Jack Wayne to take control of David's body, and he left the island. The [[New Mutants]] tracked him down and, after a struggle, convinced Wayne to allow David to again assume control.<ref>''[[New Mutants]]'' vol. 1 #44. Marvel Comics.</ref> Soon after, David was possessed by the [[Shadow King]]. While under the Shadow King's influence, David killed the mutant [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]] and destroyed 2/3 of the island. When the [[X-Men]] and [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] defeated the Shadow King, David was again left in a coma.<ref>[[Muir Island Saga]], involving ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #278-280 and ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' #69-70. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Legion Quest/Age of Apocalypse===\nYears later, David awoke from his coma believing his psyche fully healed. When he had killed the mutant [[precognition|precog]] Destiny, David had absorbed her psyche. Destiny gave David vague prophetic guidance about the great world that could exist \"if only, years ago, [[Professor X]] had been given a real chance to fulfill his dream.\"<ref>''X-Men vol. 2'' #38. Marvel Comics.</ref> David, who despite his belief was not sane, understood these words as a directive to travel back in time and kill [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]], Xavier's greatest adversary, to allow his father Professor X achieve the dream of human-mutant coexistence. \n\nAs several X-Men attempted to stop him, Legion traveled twenty years into the past, accidentally dragging the X-Men with him. David appeared in the past in front of Xavier and Magneto, who at the time were orderlies in a mental hospital. As Legion attacked Magneto, the X-Men intervened. After overpowering the X-Men, Legion readied his fatal blow for Magneto, but Xavier leaped in front of the lethal psychic attack and was himself killed. By accidentally killing his father, the horrified David prevented his own birth and ceased to exist. The death of Xavier created a catastrophic alternate timeline, the [[Age of Apocalypse]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Dreams Die!|journal=X-Men|date=February 1995|volume=2|series=Legion Quest|issue=41}}</ref> \n\nUltimately, [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] managed to fix the timeline by enlisting the aid of the new reality's X-Men to travel back in time to the moment of Xavier's murder. There Bishop confronted Legion, using David's own power to create a psionic loop that showed the young mutant the damage that his actions would cause. David allowed the energy released in this process to incinerate him, in his last moments apologizing for what he had done.\"<ref>''X-Men Omega'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> \n\nWhile David was considered deceased, some of his alternate personalities manifested as spirits and started terrorizing Israel (where David had been born). [[Excalibur_(comics)|Excalibur]] was called to stop them. Ultimately [[Meggan]] used her empathy to calm their rage, convincing them to go \"towards the light.\"<ref>''Excalibur (1st series)'' #121. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Return===\nDavid had in fact not died; rather, his mind manifested in Otherplace, a timeless interdimensional limbo. When Bishop had turned Legion's psychic power back on him, it devastated David's mental landscape, undoing all the healing efforts of Karami and Professor Xavier. David now had thousands of personalities vying for control in his mind. David wandered through Otherplace for an untold period of time, trying to make his way back home.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Magik_(Illyana_Rasputin)|Magik]], a mutant able to travel across dimensions, reached out and contacted one of David's personalities, \"The Legion,\" who could alter reality at a cosmic scale (this incredibly powerful personality claimed to be the \"real\" David, although it was distinct from David's core personality).<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #20. Marvel Comics.</ref> Magik offered to guide Legion back to this dimension, provided that The Legion would aid her by destroying her nemeses, the Elder Gods, when she asked.<ref name=\"''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #21. Marvel Comics.\">''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #21. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDavid re-manifested in the physical world, although his core David personality had been imprisoned in his mindscape by his other personalities, allowing the more malicious personalities to take turns controlling his body. One of these personalities killed and absorbed the mind of a young girl, Marci Sobol, who became another personality within Legion. David was discovered by the New Mutants as they investigated a possible mutant case in [[Westcliffe, Colorado]].<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> David absorbed [[Karma (comics)|Karma]] and [[Magik_(Illyana_Rasputin)|Magik]] into his mind. As the rest of the team fought a losing battle against various personalities that seized control of Legion's body, in his mindscape Karma and Magik destroyed other hostile personalities. Eventually they found the Marci personality, who led them to David's imprisoned core self. By freeing David and helping him reassert control, Karma and Magik saved the rest of the team and were restored to their bodies.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> David was detained by the X-Men and put in the care of Professor X, [[Doctor Nemesis]], [[Danger (comics)|Danger]], and [[Rogue_(comics)|Rogue]].<ref name=\"New Mutants, vol. 3 #5\">''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWeeks later, Magik managed to bring the Elder Gods back to Earth, planning to have her revenge on them. The Elder Gods manifested, causing catastrophic destruction, and appeared ready to lay waste to the world. As the various mutant teams tried to stop this apocalypse, Magik sent her ally Karma to free Legion and awaken \"The Legion\" personality to fulfill its bargain. The Legion, who Magik called \"The God Mutant,\" appeared and altered reality to wipe the Elder Gods from existence and reset the world to a time before they had manifested.<ref name=\"''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #21. Marvel Comics.\"/>  After this, David's core personality returned and he was taken back into the care and treatment of the X-Men.\n\n===Age of X===\nBelieving that David's psyche would be healed if his alternate personalities were quarantined, [[Doctor Nemesis]] began to catalog and contain these personalities within David's mind. Unbeknownst to Doctor Nemesis and Professor Xavier, however, David's mind subconsciously perceived this intervention as a threat and created a \"psychic antibody,\" a powerful new personality, to defend itself. The new personality had access to a degree of David's underlying ability to alter reality and time. Assuming the appearance of the deceased Moira McTaggert (considered a mother figure by David due to his time under her care at Muir Island), the personality attempted to 'protect' Legion from the 'assault' on his mind by creating a [[Pocket_universe|pocket reality]] where Legion was the hero that he always wanted to be.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy #244. Marvel Comics.</ref> Many members of various X-teams were also brought into this new reality, which existed separately from [[Earth-616|Marvel's primary continuity]].<ref>''X-Men: Legacy #247. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe alternate pocket reality, the [[Age of X]], was a dystopia in which mutants had been hunted almost to extinction; the remaining mutants were kept alive by Legion's mutant team, who daily generated a force wall to repel attacking human forces. Legion himself remained unaware that one of his personalities had created this world, and most of the mutants who had been brought into the reality by 'Moira' believed that they had always been there. Within this pocket reality the 'Moira' personality was practically omnipotent, creating and controlling random soldiers for Legion and the other mutants to kill. Eventually, Legacy, the alternate [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], discovered that 'Moira' had in fact created this reality. Confronted with this truth, Legion spoke to 'Moira,' who tearfully offered to create as many universes for him as he wanted. Instead, David absorbed 'Moira' back into himself and erased the Age of X reality, restoring its participants to [[Earth-616]] reality; ultimately, this entire timeline had lasted seven days in their normal continuity.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #245-248; ''New Mutants'' Vol. 3 #22-23. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Lost Legions===\nWith the Age of X incident underscoring the potentially apocalyptic scope of David's power, Professor X proposed a new approach to help Legion retain control of himself. Instead of isolating David from the other personalities in his mind, Professor X suggested that he learn to co-exist with them. To this end, Doctor Nemesis, Madison Jeffries and Reed Richards designed a Neural Switchboard Wristband for David. This switchboard assigned unique numbers to different Legion personalities. When David entered a number, the device stimulated cells in his thalamus and neocortex, creating a one-way link between David's core personality and the alternate personality he had selected. This allowed Legion to access the power of that personality for several seconds without being overwhelmed by it. While testing the device, Legion discovered that six of his personalities were no longer in his mind, but had \"escaped,\" manifesting separately from him in the real world.<ref name=\"X-Men: Legacy #249\">''X-Men: Legacy'' #249. Marvel Comics.</ref> With a team of X-Men, Legion tracked down and reabsorbed all of these rogue personas. While absorbing the last one, he accidentally absorbed Rogue along with it, and, after releasing her, David suffered a massive shock to his nervous system. Rogue stated that, while she was inside Legion, she was connected to thousands of types of powers and there were more being born all the time.<ref name=\"X-Men: Legacy #253\">''X-Men: Legacy'' #253. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===The Fiend===\nTo aid his recovery, Professor X left Legion with Merzah the Mystic, a powerful empath and telepath who ran a Himalayan monastery. While at the monastery, David gained much greater control of himself, and he stopped using the Neural Switchboard Wristband. Under Merzah's tutelage, David learned to visualize a facility in his mind where his alternate personalities could be kept and controlled.<ref name=\"X-Men: Legacy Vol. 2 #1\">''X-Men: Legacy'' Vol. 2 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, while David was at the monastery, elsewhere in the world Professor X was killed. When Legion sensed this, the mental shock caused a catastrophic release of energy that killed Merzah and everyone else at the monastery.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' Vol. 2 #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> In addition, without knowing it, David subconsciously created a new personality, The Fiend. This personality was able to kill other personalities in his mind, absorbing their powers in the process.\n\nIn the final issue of ''X-Men: Legacy'', Legion, reaching the full extent of his powers, decided to erase himself from existence.<ref name=\"X-Men: Legacy #24\">''X-Men: Legacy'' Vol.2 #24. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Trauma===\nFor unknown reasons (perhaps elements of his own psyche working against him), Legion's attempt to erase himself from existence failed. When he reappeared, David's mind was again fragmented into many personalities, including a malicious new personality, \"Lord Trauma.\" Lord Trauma aimed to take over David's mind and body by absorbing all of David's other personalities. In a desperate attempt to save himself, David sought out the help of renowned young psychotherapist Hannah Jones to delve into his fractured mind and fight back this dark personality.<ref name=\"Legion 1\">''Legion'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> While Jones was ultimately able to help Legion defeat Trauma, she remained trapped in David's psyche (her body in a [[Persistent_vegetative_state|vegetative coma]]). To thank Jones, Legion placed her psyche into a dream state/alternate reality where she achieved her biggest goals.<ref name=\"Legion 5\">''Legion'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n=== X-Men Break Up ===\nAs the X-Men race around the globe to fight the temporal anomalies that have been springing up and to corral the hundreds of Madrox duplicates wreaking havoc, Legion arrives at the X-Mansion, seemingly in control of his powers and psyche. While the young X-Men try to ascertain what he wants, elsewhere Jean Grey and Psylocke team up to psychically purge whatever force is controlling the army of Madrox duplicates. Finding the prime Madrox imprisoned below the area where the army of duplicates are congregating, he explains that Legion imprisoned him and implanted his numerous personalities and powers across the hundreds of duplicates. However, with his control broken, Legion goes berserk in the mansion, attacking the young X-Men and ranting about a vision of the future. The rest of the X-Men arrive to help but Legion singlehandedly takes on the whole team until he and Jean Grey go head-to-head. Legion then explains that he's trying to prevent a vision of the future - the arrival of the Horsemen of Salvation - but just as Legion mentions them, the Horsemen arrive.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' (2018) #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n[[File:XMEN-LegionPowers.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Doctor Nemesis]], [[Blindfold (comics)|Blindfold]], and [[Professor X]] among Legion's alters.]]\nLegion is an [[Omega-level mutant]]<ref name=\"New Mutants, vol. 3 #4\">''New Mutants, vol. 3'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> who has [[dissociative identity disorder|multiple personalities]]. Fundamentally, he has the ability to alter reality and time on a cosmic scale at will,<ref name=\"X-Men: Legacy #24\"/> but due to his multiple personalities, in practice his abilities vary depending on the dominant personality: each alter has different powers enabled by David's subconscious manipulation of reality. The core personality, David Haller himself, generally does not manifest mutant abilities, but must access various personalities to use their power, sometimes losing control of himself to that personality. Some of Legion's personalities physically transform his body (e.g., manifesting a prehensile tongue, becoming a woman, transforming into a werewolf, etc.). The first alter to manifest, Jemail Karami, was [[telepathy|telepathic]].  Other prominent alters include Jack Wayne ([[psychokinesis|telekinetic]]) and Cyndi ([[pyrokinesis|pyrokinetic]]). Legion has over a thousand different personalities (the exact number is unknown), and his mind can create additional alters in response to external or internal events.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #254</ref>\n\nThe cumulative abilities of all his personalities make him one of the most powerful mutants in existence, if not the most powerful.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' vol. 2 #6.</ref> Since the abilities of his personalities stem from his subconscious alteration of reality, Legion is theoretically capable of manifesting any power he can imagine. In two instances David has manifested the full extent of his ability to alter time and reality: in the first, he wiped the Elder Gods from existence and reset the universe to a state before the Elder Gods first appeared on Earth,<ref>''New Mutants, vol. 3'' #20-21. Marvel Comics.</ref> and in the other he observed the entirety of spacetime and mended damage his personalities had done to it.<ref name=\"X-Men: Legacy #24\"/>\n\nLegion can absorb other people's psyches into his mind, either intentionally or, if he is next to them when they die, unintentionally.<ref name=\"New Mutants, vol. 3 #5\"/> Conversely, in several instances Legion has had personalities manifest and act separately from him (or even against him) in the physical world; in most instances Legion has ultimately reabsorbed these personalities back into himself. Presumably, both his absorption of other psyches and the physical manifestations of his own personalities are enabled by Legion's underlying ability to alter reality/time at will.\n\nGenerally, David's ability to access and control his personalities/powers is closely tied to his self confidence and self esteem: the better he feels about himself, the more control he exercises. Unfortunately, David often suffers from self-doubt and self-recrimination, meaning that he must struggle to remain in control. Following the Age of X, David briefly used a Neural Switchboard Wristband engineered by [[Doctor Nemesis]], [[Madison Jeffries]], and [[Reed Richards]]. This device allowed Legion to utilize a personality's power set for several seconds without being overwhelmed by that personality. However, he soon abandoned this and attempted instead to develop a more organic control over his personalities.<ref name=\"X-Men: Legacy Vol. 2 #1\"/>\n\n===Personalities===\nThe following characters are different personalities of Legion that have appeared thus far, each one manifesting different powers:\n\n* Through the personality of terrorist '''Jemail Karami''' (the name given to Personality #2), he has manifested [[telepathy]].<ref>''New Mutants'' #26. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n* Through the personality of roustabout adventurer '''Jack Wayne''' (the name given to Personality #3), he has manifested [[psychokinesis|telekinesis]].<ref name=\"New\" /> This personality was often quite dangerous and would not hesitate to hurt or kill others if it would allow him to remain independent/free from David's control.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Eventually, Jack Wayne was subsumed by a different, malevolent Legion personality, '''Lord Trauma.'''<ref>''Legion'' #1-5. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n* Through the personality of the rebellious girl '''Cyndi''' (the name given to Personality #4), he has manifested [[pyrokinesis]]. This personality of Legion has a crush on [[Cypher (Marvel Comics)|Cypher]].<ref name=\"New\"/>\n* Through the personality of '''The Legion''' (the name given to Personality #5, which claims to be Legion's \"real me\"), he can warp time and reality. [[Magik_(Illyana_Rasputin)|Magik]] nicknamed this personality the \"God-Mutant.\"<ref name=\"''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #21. Marvel Comics.\"/>\n* Through the personality of '''Sally''' (the name given to Personality #67), he has the appearance of an obese woman with [[Hulk]]-like super-strength.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n* Through the personality of a punk rocker named '''Lucas''' (the name given to Personality #115), he can channel sound into energy blasts.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #14. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n* Through '''Personality #181''', he can enlarge himself to an undetermined size. This was the first power Legion utilized with the Neural Switchboard Wristband.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #248. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n* Through the personality of '''Johnny Gomorrah''' (the name given to Personality #186), he can transmute his enemies and objects into salt.<ref name=\"X-Men: Legacy #249\"/>\n* Through the personality of '''Time-Sink''' (the name given to Personality #227), he has the ability of time-manipulation.<ref name=\"X-Men: Legacy #253\"/> This rebellious personality was able to become independent from David but was eventually found and reabsorbed by David.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' Vol. 1 #250. Marvel Comics.</ref> David was ultimately forced to stop using Time-Sink's powers because when David tried to access the personality, it would always fight to get back its freedom.<ref name=\"X-Men: Legacy #253\"/>\n* Through '''Personality #302''', he can move at supersonic speeds.<ref name=\"X-Men: Legacy #253\"/>\n* Through the personality of '''Styx''' (the name given to Personality #666), he has the ability to absorb the consciousness of anyone he touches, turning that person's body into a shell that he can then control. The possessed individual can still access any special abilities they have, and there does not appear to be a limit to the number of individuals simultaneously controlled.<ref name=\"X-Men: Legacy #251\"/> David considers this manipulative personality his most dangerous, because it is clever, cruel, and extremely ambitious.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' Vol. 1 #252. Marvel Comics.</ref> Styx was able to become independent from Legion, manifesting as a desiccated corpse, and tried to take control of Legion himself, so that he could use Legion's reality-altering powers to remake the world according to his will. Legion, using the power of his '''Chain''' personality, managed to trick and reabsorb Styx.<ref name=\"X-Men: Legacy #253\"/>\n* Through '''Personality #762''', he becomes a [[Piracy|pirate]] with the ability to belch an acidic gas.\n* Through '''Personality #898''', he becomes a [[centaur]].\n* Through the personality of '''Delphic''' (the name given to Personality #1012), he becomes a blue-skinned, seemingly-omniscient female seer who will answer any three questions from supplicants.<ref name=\"X-Men: Legacy #249\"/>\n\nLegion personalities that have not been assigned numbers include:\n\n* '''Absence''', an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]]/[[demon]] creature with its eyes sewn shut who claims to have traveled through different realities and who can siphon off heat and love.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n* '''Bleeding Image''', a living voodoo doll who can redirect and amplify the pain from any injury he inflicts on himself onto his victims. As he notes, \"How much must David hate himself, to have imagined me?\" This malicious personality was able to become independent from David but he was eventually found and stated to have been destroyed by Magneto.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #252. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n* '''Chain''', effectively a human virus who turns anyone he touches into a copy of himself with a new weapon. The power dissipates when the original is dealt with. This personality was able to become independent from David but he was eventually found and reabsorbed by David.<ref name=\"X-Men: Legacy #251\">''X-Men: Legacy'' #251. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n* '''Chronodon''', a [[dinosaur]] with a clock on its face. Based on its name and appearance, it can be assumed that it can manipulate time in some way.\n* '''[[Clown]]''', a surly-looking clown that can blast energy from his mouth.\n* '''Compass Rose''', who can locate any person and teleport to them.\n* '''The Delusionaut''', a train engineer with a billow stack for a head who uses the smoke that he exudes to create illusions so convincing that they fool even powerful telepaths such as [[Emma Frost]]. He manifested outside of Legion to help him at one point, and eventually was one of the personalities that volunteered to meld together to form '''Gestalt'''.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' vol. 2 #20.</ref> \n* '''Drexel''', a foul-mouthed simpleton with super-strength.\n* '''Endgame''', huge and aggressive armor that instantly manifests the perfect counter to any attack executed against it (for example, becoming intangible, manifesting super strength, transmuting its material from metal to wood to defeat Magneto, etc.). This personality became independent from David, but it was eventually found and reabsorbed by David.<ref name=\"X-Men: Legacy #253\"/>\n* '''The Fiend/\"Charles Xavier\"''', a dangerous personality David created following the mental shock of the death of his father, Professor X. The Fiend manifests as either a yellow [[goblin]]-like creature or in the guise of Professor X; it has significant psychic abilities, including [[precognition]] and [[Spirit_possession|possession]], and can kill other Legion personalities in Legion's mind, absorbing their power.<ref name=\"Legion 1\"/> Eventually, the Fiend became independent from David and tried to help him retain more control of himself.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' vol. 2 #6.</ref>\n* '''Findel the Finder''', who can find anyone across the galaxy.\n* '''Gestalt''', a powerful fusion of several Legion personalities with the core personality of David himself, allowing the abilities of these personalities to manifest simultaneously under David's control. Legion created Gestalt to successfully repel an attack on his mind.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' vol. 2 #24. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n* '''Hugh Davidson''', a stereotypical prepster with a long prehensile tongue.\n* '''Hunter''', a macho-man personality David's mind created to replace Jack Wayne, when that personality was subsumed by the Lord Trauma personality.\n* '''Hypnobloke''', a gentleman with flashing swirls for eyes who wears a top hat and carries a pocket watch. He has the power of hypnotic suggestion.\n* '''Joe Fury''', an angry young man who can generate flame and other types of energy, and whom David struggles to repress.<ref name=\"Legion 1\"/>\n* '''Kirbax the Kraklar''', a demonic creature that can fly and generate electricity.\n* '''Ksenia Nadejda Panov''', a Moscovite heiress, discus-throwing champion, caviar exporter, and torturer of puppies.

This personality became independent from David and tried to absorb all his other personas in order to gain control over David's body, although Trauma was eventually destroyed.<ref name=\"Legion 5\"/>\n* '''Marci Sabol''', a normal human girl who befriended David but was killed and absorbed into him by one of his other personalities;<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> she has significant influence within David's mindscape.<ref name=\"''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #21. Marvel Comics.\"/> \n* '''Max Kelvin''', a crotchety old man whose eyes protrude when he uses his powers of plasmatic flame generation.\n* '''Moira Kinross/X''', a mother figure created by David's mind to protect his mindscape from tampering. This persona, which could warp reality, became independent from David and created the dystopian pocket reality dubbed ''[[Age of X]]'' where David was seen as a hero. Within this pocket reality X was practically omnipotent, altering the mindsets and personalities of the fabricated entities in her reality.<ref>''Age of X: Alpha'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> \n* '''Mycolojester''', a [[plant]]-like entity with the attire of a [[jester]], who can emit toxic spores from his skin. These spores act as a powerful nerve gas, but their effects can be dissipated by water.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' vol. 2 #6.</ref> This personality volunteered to help David by merging with several other personalities to become '''Gestalt.'''<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' vol. 2 #20.</ref>\n* '''Non-Newtonian Annie''', a skinny purple woman dressed in pink clothes and cloaked in a \"zero-tau nullskin\" that does not conform to [[Conservation_of_energy|the law of conservation of energy]] (e.g., [[kinetic energy]] that hits it is immediately amplified and reflected directly back on its source).<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' vol. 2 #4.</ref>\n* '''Origamist''', one of the most powerful personalities in David's mind, is a reality warping sumo wrestler who can fold [[spacetime]], allowing, among other things, instant [[teleportation]] of any object to any location.\n* '''Protozoan Porter''', a large green [[leech]]-like being who can teleport by disassembling himself into minuscule ameboid-like parts that reassemble after reaching his destination.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' vol. 2 #10.</ref> This personality volunteered to help David by merging with several other personalities to create '''Gestalt.'''<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' vol. 2 #20.</ref> \n* '''Pukatus Jr.''', a small [[cherub]]-like demon who flies and can vomit an acidic substance.\n* '''Skinsmith''', who can produce artificial skin on any surface or bend/alter the skin of others.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' vol. 2 #4.</ref>\n* '''Specs''', a nervous young man with large glasses who can see through solid objects. This personality develops a romantic interest in [[Magma_(comics)|Magma]].<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #4.\"</ref> \n* '''Susan in Sunshine''', an innocent-looking blonde child with the ability to sense, augment and manipulate the emotions of those around her and, if she wishes, convert those emotions into destructive energy.<ref name=\"X-Men: Legacy #249\"/> This personality became independent from Legion, but she was eventually found and reabsorbed by him.<ref name=\"X-Men: Legacy #251\"/>\n* '''Tami Haar''', a nightclub singer who is a friend and companion to David; she appears to have a master knowledge of David's mindscape, which among other things allows her to manifest in the real world.<ref>''Legion'' #4.</ref>\n* '''Tyrannix the Abominoid''', a small and hapless [[Cthulhu]]-like creature with telepathic powers.<ref name=\"X-Men: Legacy Vol. 2 #1\"/> When David traveled within his mindscape, he often used Tyrannix as a backpack. Tyrannix was the first personality to volunteer to help David by melding to create '''Gestalt.'''<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' vol. 2 #20.</ref>\n* '''The Weaver''', probably Legion's most powerful splinter personality, a large [[arachnid]] creature whose massive limbs are connected to a main body wreathed in bright light. The Weaver can change and refabricate reality itself, and it is ultimately revealed to be either David's core self or a mirror of David. When David and the Weaver united, he could observe and alter [[Spacetime|all time and space]] at will; David, aware of the extent and implications of this godlike power, attempted to unmake himself by erasing his own birth.<ref name=\"X-Men: Legacy #24\"/> For unknown reasons his attempt failed (it may have been undermined by other aspects of David's psyche), in the process creating the '''Lord Trauma''' personality.<ref>''Legion'' #1.

His mother is [[Moira MacTaggert]] and his father is Charles Xavier. He possesses Proteus' reality warping power and is named '''David Xavier'''. He escapes his mother's [[Muir Island|facility]], looking for his father, and murders hundreds to discredit him. David is later crushed by [[Alternate versions of Colossus#Ultimate Colossus|Colossus]], while possessing [[S.T.R.I.K.E.]] agent [[Betsy Braddock]] inside a car.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #15-19 (2002).

Alternate versions of [[Unuscione]], [[Hellion (Marvel Comics)|Hellion]], [[Rachel Summers]], Legion, and [[Psylocke]]]]\nIn the ''[[Age of X]]'' reality, Legion leads the Force Warriors, a select group of telekinetics who rebuild the \"Force Walls\" (telekinetic shields that protect Fortress X) on a daily basis to protect mutants from human attacks. Unlike his 616 counterpart, there is no trace of the other personalities shown. It is ultimately revealed that the Age of X reality was unconsciously created by Legion himself. A flashback reveals that in the 616 universe Professor X was arguing with [[Dr. Nemesis]] regarding the latter's containment and deletion of Legion's other personalities in an effort to stabilize him. While Dr. Nemesis claimed that everything was going according to his plan, Professor X was unconvinced and entered Legion's mind. There he found the other personalities dead and their rotting corpses left in their containment units. This surprised Dr. Nemesis, who had thought that when a personality was deleted it should simply disappear. Professor X was then attacked by what he called a \"psychic antibody,\" a personality Legion had subconsciously created to defend against Nemesis's deleting of the personalities. To overcome Professor X on the psychic plane, this personality took on the face of Moira MacTaggart and claimed that it would make a world where Legion could be happy. The 'Moira' personality then reshaped Utopia into Fortress X and inserted itself as Moira and the supercomputer X. When finally confronted about its actions, the personality made the Force walls fall, allowing the human armies to attack. 'Moira' announced her intention to destroy the 616 universe as well as the Age of X and to create a new safe place for David to live happily forever. Instead, David absorbed her and reverted the Fortress X to the normal reality, with a few modifications.<ref>''New Mutants'' Vol. 3 #24.

Legion's backstory remains mostly unchanged, although David Haller is a fairly normal blonde teenager with no visible mutant powers. In the episode, David appears to be kidnapped by a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[punk subculture|punk]] named '''Lucas''', but in reality Lucas and David are one and the same. David's body can somehow change to match whichever of his multiple personalities is dominant, with personality and body shifts sometimes happening at random. The mechanism behind this ability is never fully explained, although it is possible that David is using strong psionic abilities to alter people's perception of his appearance rather than actually changing as [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]] had done when first trying to avoid being discovered. His personalities sometimes appeared in two places at once, supporting the control-of-perception theory. Only three personalities were shown. As David has no obvious powers of his own, Lucas possesses telepathic and telekinetic powers, as well as pyrokinetics while '''Ian''', the third personality, is a young mute boy who is also a pyrokinetic. As Lucas is shown capable of both telepathic and pyrokinetic powers, it is possible the Lucas persona may have access to the powers of other personalities (if any beyond these three exist). Lucas lured Professor X to Scotland and tricked him into locking David's other personalities away, leaving Lucas free to be himself. It was never explained what Lucas's goals were after this, as the show has stopped production before his storyline could be further explored.\n* Legion is mentioned in ''[[Marvel Anime|Marvel Anime: X-Men]]''. He is the root cause of something called \"Damon-Hall Syndrome\". This condition affects mutants that develop a secondary mutation causing multiple personalities, uncontrolled physical mutation, and psychological instability. There is a vaccine which Beast created to stop its progress. It should also be mentioned that one of the main antagonists of the series named '''Takeo Sasaki''' (voiced by [[Atsushi Abe]] in the Japanese version and by [[Steve Staley]] in the English Dub) is the son of Professor X and [[Moira MacTaggert|Yui Sasaki]] (a scientist in mutant research). This character is similar to Legion in many ways except for design and name, and is also similar to [[Proteus (Marvel Comics)|Proteus]] in terms of his reality-warping powers. He attended his mother's school for mutants where he was a classmate of [[Armor (comics)|Hisako Ichiki]] and an incident with Takeo being picked on by the other children resulted in a fire that burned the nearby neighborhood and had included a small burn on Hisako's hand. [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]] planned to use a near-comatose Takeo to warp reality so that the mutants can rule the world. Takeo's powers go out of control enough for him to kill Mastermind and for the entire facility he was in to collapse as he emerges as a colossal energy being. Learning that Takeo hates him for being born into a world where his powers cause him so much suffering, Professor X blames himself for causing Takeo pain. The X-Men try to attack Takeo, but are easily defeated. Professor X then prepares to destroy Takeo's mind and kill him, fully intending to die along with his son. Jean's presence manages to revive the X-Men and give them courage to fight on against. Hisako recalls her friendly past with Takeo and insists that Takeo is a good person who can be saved. Her feelings cause her armor to generate a brilliant light, reaching Takeo and bringing him back to his senses. He and Charles are able to reconcile and Takeo's body is destroyed. Before his death, Takeo is able to reassure Yui and Charles that he is all right.\n\n==Collected Editions==\n\n===X-Men Legacy===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Title !! Material collected !!
