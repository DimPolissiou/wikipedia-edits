In October, 2009 it went into bankruptcy, halting all business.\n\n== Mission ==\nThe British Columbia Safety Council's mission was to assist the Province's citizens in preventing injuries arising from work, travel, home or leisure activities through safety education and training, and through advocacy efforts for effective policy and regulation.\n\n== History ==\nIn December 1945, the B.C. Safety Council was established and also incorporated under the Society Act of British Columbia. Originally focused on industrial safety to support war production, the Council was involved in traffic safety issues by the early 1950s. The Council introduced the Defensive Driving Program to B.C. Fatalities from road accidents were twice what they were in the early 20th century, so driver education became an urgent and top priority for British Columbia citizens. Licensing and monitoring of new drivers was not taken as seriously as it is today, and drinking and driving was not yet recognized as the social epidemic it later became. In the workplace, serious trauma injuries were almost commonplace, stress was thought to be just a part of the job and repetitive strain injuries had not been defined yet in the popular jargon.\n\nIn the 1960s the BC Safety Council was concerned with issues such as convincing government and the public that seat belt and motorcycle helmet laws were necessary in order to ensure public safety. During this same period, the Council's Underwater Section provided training for fledgling scuba divers and continued to do so until the industry developed and instituted its own specialized training programs.\n\nThe Council's Industrial Section provided programs for supervisors, safety committees and managers. Its Blasting Course, which helped miners learn to properly prepare for blasting operations, was part of this training. Over the years, the Council became heavily involved in workplace safety issues, with training programs and seminars covering a variety of topics, including supervisor training for safety, WHMIS, Safety Committee training, confined space training, and fall protection.\n\nThe BC Safety Council Motorcycle Training course was established in 1971, based on support from volunteer instructors and motorcycles supplied by local motorcycle industry representatives.\n\nThe Safety Council opened the Professional Driver Centre in 1971, at the unused Locarno beach ex army compound Vancouver British Columbia. Later they moved to Boundary Bay airport. Their Class 1-3, Air Brake Courses and Motorcycle Rider Training Program provided professional, hands-on training to novice operators of these vehicles.\n\nIn the 1990s they moved into construction safety training with Safety Officer and Trade Safety Coordinator programs developed from scratch. \nIn its first 50 years they enjoyed public funding support via grants from the provincial government and the WCB, but that ended in 1995. Like many other not-for-profit groups, they faced a significant funding crisis that year, one that generated a fundamental change in their game plan. They became solely reliant on income from memberships and tuitions, making self-sufficiency essential. At the same time, the business world was now placing a new emphasis on marketing, sales and customer service, issues which became critical for their continued survival.\n\nCouncil staffing levels, which had peaked at 24 in the early 1980s, went from 19 to 9 almost overnight, and programs that were not monetarily self-sustaining were chopped if they could not be quickly reformed. Their non-fee community safety efforts had to be suspended or drastically cut back. Although the Council was a registered charity, they had to begin thinking like a business. In 1996 it launched the Western Conference on Safety, partnering with Pacific Safety Center Ltd. in this new venture.\n\nFrom that point on, the British Columbia Safety Council functioned with a highly skilled but relatively small core staff; with the delivery of programs placed mainly in the hands of experienced and knowledgeable contract and part-time instructors. They offer a broad ranges of education and training programs in occupational, traffic and community safety. The Council offered training to its members and clients anywhere in B.C., 24 hours a day, seven days a week.<ref name=history>\"Safety First\" Online Newsletter (60th Anniversary), [https://web.archive.org/web/20061106074249/http://www.safetycouncil.bc.ca/newsletter/2006/spring/pdfs/60anniversary.pdf BC Safety Council History], Spring 2006</ref>\n\nWithout public funding support, and facing a rapidly growing array of independent consultants, private training organizations and a number of industry-specific Safety Councils sponsored by WorkSafe BC, the Council's traditional markets were eroding steadily in the new millennium.  Without secure funding, its ability to maintain standards in such a wide variety of programs, and facing large capital needs, the Council's financial resources eroded.  The loss of the use of Boundary Bay Airport where its Motorcycle Program had operated so successfully was a major blow.  The recession of 2008 was the final obstacle to survival, and the Council was not able to evolve fast enough to reduce overhead and build new revenue streams.   \n(The Council Entered bankruptcy proceedings October 20, 2009)\n\n<blockquote>\nNOTICE OF BANKRUPTCY AND FIRST MEETING OF CREDITORS (Section 102(4)) IN THE MATTER OF THE BANKRUPTCY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA SAFETY COUNCIL NOTICE is hereby given that the bankruptcy of British Columbia Safety Council, of the City of Richmond, occurred on the 20th day of October, 2009, and that the First Meeting of Creditors will be held on the 9th day of November, 2009, at 10:00 o'clock in the forenoon, at E.

However, the presence of two other guests prevents him from taking a shot.\n\nThe next morning, Tony drops off Meadow for an interview.

[[Jennifer Melfi|Dr. Melfi]] phones to reschedule Tony's appointment; Carmela, discovering that Tony's therapist is a woman, assumes that he is sleeping with her. She pours her heart out to Father Phil about her fears for her family and her soul, and then takes [[Eucharist|communion]] with him. She sips the wine; he drains the cup.

A target web page may be removed. The server that hosts the target page could fail, be removed from service, or relocate to a new [[domain name]]. A domain name's registration may lapse or be transferred to another party. Some causes will result in the link failing to find any target at returning an error such as [[HTTP 404]]. Other causes will cause a link to target content other than what was intended by the link's author.\n\nOther reasons for broken links include:\n* the restructuring of websites that causes changes in URLs (e.g. {{code|domain.net/pine_tree}} might be moved to {{code|domain.net/tree/pine}})\n* relocation of formerly free content to behind a [[paywall]]\n* a change in server architecture that results in code such as [[PHP]] functioning differently\n* dynamic page content such as search results that changes by design\n* the presence of user-specific information such as a login name within the link\n* deliberate blocking by [[content filter]]s or [[Firewall (networking)|firewalls]]\n* the removal of [[Generic top-level domain|gTLDs]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/post/the-death-of-a-tld|title=The death of a TLD|website=blog.benjojo.co.uk|access-date=2018-07-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726220205/https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/post/the-death-of-a-tld|archive-date=2018-07-26|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Prevention and detection==\nStrategies for preventing link rot can focus on placing content where its likelihood of persisting is strong, authoring links that are less likely to be broken, taking steps to preserve existing links, or repairing links whose targets have been relocated or removed.\n\nThe creation of URLs that will not change with time is the fundamental method of preventing link rot.

A target web page may be removed. The server that hosts the target page could fail, be removed from service, or relocate to a new [[domain name]].

Using suitable software, the device may display the position on a map, and it may offer routing directions. The [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) is one of a handful of [[satellite navigation|global navigation satellite system]]s (GNSS) made up of a network of a minimum of 24, but currently [[List of GPS satellites|30, satellites]] placed into orbit by the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]].<ref name=\"GPS.gov advice\">{{cite web |last1=US Government|title=GPS.gov|url=http://www.gps.gov/support/faq/#gap1|website=GPS.gov|publisher=US Govt.|accessdate=21 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nGPS was originally developed for use by the United States military, but in the 1980s, the United States government allowed the system to be used for civilian purposes. Though the GPS satellite data is free and works anywhere in the world, the GPS device and the associated software must be bought or rented.\n\nA satellite navigation device can retrieve (from one or more satellite systems) location and time information in all weather conditions, anywhere on or near the Earth. GPS reception requires an unobstructed line of sight to four or more GPS satellites,<ref>{{cite web|title=What is a GPS?|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/scitech/mysteries/global.html}}</ref> and is subject to poor satellite signal conditions. In exceptionally poor signal conditions, for example in urban areas, satellite signals may exhibit [[multipath propagation]] where signals bounce off structures, or are [[Radio propagation#Absorption|weakened]] by meteorological conditions. Obstructed lines of sight may arise from a tree canopy or inside a structure, such as in a building, garage or tunnel. Today, most standalone GPS receivers are used in automobiles. The GPS capability of [[smartphone]]s may use [[assisted GPS]] (A-GPS) technology, which can use the base station or [[cell tower]]s to provide a faster [[Time to First Fix]] (TTFF), especially when GPS signals are poor or unavailable. However, the mobile network part of the A-GPS technology would not be available when the smartphone is outside the range of the mobile reception network, while the GPS aspect would otherwise continue to be available.\n\nThe Russian Global Navigation Satellite System ([[GLONASS]]) was developed contemporaneously with GPS, but suffered from incomplete coverage of the globe until the mid-2000s.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Russia Launches Three More GLONASS-M Space Vehicles|url=http://www.insidegnss.com/node/982|magazine=[[Inside GNSS]]|accessdate=December 26, 2008|date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206081945/http://insidegnss.com/node/982|archive-date=6 February 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> GLONASS can be added to GPS devices to make more satellites available and enabling positions to be fixed more quickly and accurately, to within 2 meters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.clove.co.uk/2012/01/10/glonass-the-future-for-all-smartphones/|title=index.php|author=|date=10 January 2012|website=clove.co.uk|accessdate=3 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nOther satellite navigation services with (intended) global coverage are the European [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]] and the Chinese [[BeiDou]].\n\n==Automotive navigation system==\nUsing satellite information and subject to the sophistication of installed software, a GPS device used as an [[automobile navigation system]] may be used in a number of contexts, including:\n* maps, including street maps, displayed in human-readable format via text or in a graphical format,\n* [[turn-by-turn navigation]] directions to a human in charge of a vehicle or vessel via text or speech,\n* directions fed directly to an [[Autonomous car|autonomous vehicle]] such as a robotic probe,\n* [[traffic congestion map]]s (depicting either historical or real-time data) and suggested alternative directions,\n* information on nearby amenities such as restaurants, fueling stations, and [[tourist attraction]]s.\n\nNavigation devices may be able to indicate:\n* the roads or paths available, \n* traffic congestion and alternative routes,\n* roads or paths that might be taken to get to the destination,\n* if some roads are busy (now or historically) the best route to take,\n* The location of food, banks, hotels, fuel, airports or other places of interests,\n* the shortest route between the two locations,\n* the different options to drive on highway or back roads.\n\n== History ==\n{{See|Global Positioning System#History}}\n\nAs with many other technological breakthroughs of the latter 20th century, the modern GNSS system can reasonably be argued to be a direct outcome of the [[Cold War]] of the latter 20th century. The multibillion-dollar expense of the US'an and Russian programmes was initially justified by military interest; on the contrary the European Galileo was conceived as purely civilian.\n\nIn 1960, the US Navy put into service its [[Transit (satellite)|Transit satellite]] based navigation system to aid in naval navigation. The US Navy in the mid-1960s conducted an experiment to track a submarine with missiles with six satellites and orbiting poles and was able to observe satellite changes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/heo/scan/communications/policy/GPS_History.html|title=Global Positioning System History|last=Mai|first=Thuy|date=August 7, 2017|website=NASA|access-date=April 11, 2019}}</ref> Between 1960 and 1982, as the benefits were been shown, the US military consistently improved and refined its satellite navigation technology and satellite system. In 1973, the US military began to plan for a comprehensive worldwide navigational system which eventually became known as the GPS (global positioning system). In 1983, in the wake of the tragedy of the downing of the [[Korean Airlines Flight 007]], an aircraft which was shot down while in Soviet airspace due to a navigational error, President Reagan made the navigation capabilities of the existing military GPS system available for dual civilian use. However, civilian use was initially only a slightly degraded \"[[Selective Availability]]\" positioning signal. This new availability of the US military GPS system for civilian use required a certain technical collaboration with the private sector for some time, before it could become a commercial reality. In 1989, [[Magellan Navigation|Magellan Navigation Inc.]] unveiled its Magellan NAV 1000, the world\u2019s first commercial handheld GPS receiver. These units initially sold for approximately US$2,900 each. In 2000, the Clinton administration removed the military use signal restrictions, thus providing full commercial access to the US GPS satellite system.\n\nIn 1990, [[Mazda]]'s [[Eunos Cosmo]] was the first production car in the world with a [[automotive navigation system|built-in GPS navigation system]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.motortrend.com/classic/features/12q2_1993_eunos_mazda_cosmo_drive/ |title=1993 Eunos/Mazda Cosmo Classic Drive Uncosmopolitan: Meet the rarest Mazda in America |date=February 2012 |website=Motor Trend |publisher=TEN: The Enthusiast Network |accessdate=18 January 2015}}</ref> In 1991, [[Mitsubishi]] introduced GPS car navigation on the [[Mitsubishi Debonair]] (MMCS: Mitsubishi Multi Communication System).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXd32z5vN18|title=Mitsubishi DEBONAIR Commercial 1991 Japan|last=Sigma Heart|date=16 January 2015|accessdate=3 April 2018|via=YouTube}}</ref> In 1997, a navigation system using [[Differential GPS]] was developed as a factory-installed option on the [[Toyota Prius]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.player-top.fr/|title=Autoradio GPS Android pas cher, Cam\u00e9ra radar de recul - Player Top|website=www.player-top.fr|access-date=2016-07-18}}</ref>\n\nAs GPS navigation systems became more and more widespread and popular, the pricing of such systems began to fall, and their widespread availability steadily increased. Also, several additional manufacturers of these systems, such as [[Garmin]] (1991), [[Twig Com|Benefon]] (1999), [[Mio Technology|Mio]] (2002) and [[TomTom]] (2002) entered the market. Mitac Mio 168 was the first PocketPC to contain a built-in GPS receiver.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pocketgpsworld.com/mitacmio168.php|title=Mitac Mio 168 Review|first=Darren|last=Griffin|date=|website=www.pocketgpsworld.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}</ref> Benefon's 1999 entry into the market also presented users with the world's first phone based GPS navigation system. Later, as smartphone technology developed, a GPS chip eventually became standard equipment for most smartphones. To date, ever more popular satellite navigation systems and devices continue to proliferate with newly developed software and hardware applications. It has been incorporated, for example, into cameras.\n\nWhile the American GPS was the first [[satellite navigation]] system to be deployed on a fully global scale, and to be made available for commercial use, this is not the only system of its type. Due to military and other concerns, similar global or regional systems have been, or will soon be deployed by Russia, the European Union, China, India, and Japan.\n\nGNSS have made many strides into today\u2019s world. It can now help out in things such as parents now using GNSS devices to attach to their kids to monitor their movement and always know their location. Also helps out with detecting the movements and behavior of animals and also helps officers with car chases and not having to chase exactly behind a criminal and lastly using GPS bullets to catch criminals.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-26153506|title=GPS: From launch to everyday life|last=Rice|first=Carolyn|date=February 15, 2014|work=BBC News|access-date=April 27, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Sensitivity ==\nGNSS devices vary in sensitivity, speed, vulnerability to [[multipath propagation]], and other performance parameters. '''High Sensitivity''' receivers use large banks of correlators{{clarify|date=June 2016}}{{cit|date=June 2016}} and [[digital signal processing]] to search for signals very quickly. This results in very fast [[time to first fix|times to first fix]] when the signals are at their normal levels, for example outdoors. When signals are weak, for example indoors, the extra processing power can be used to integrate weak signals to the point where they can be used to provide a position or timing solution.\n\nGNSS signals are already very weak when they arrive at the Earth\u2019s surface. The [[GPS satellite]]s only transmit 27&nbsp;W (14.3&nbsp;dBW) from a distance of 20,200&nbsp;km in [[orbit]] above the Earth. By the time the signals arrive at the user's receiver, they are typically as weak as \u2212160 [[dBW]], equivalent to one-tenth of a million-billionth of a watt (100&nbsp;attowatts). This is well below the thermal noise level in its bandwidth. Outdoors, GPS signals are typically around the \u2212155 dBW level (\u2212125 [[dBm]]).\n\nConventional GPS receivers integrate the received GPS signals for the same amount of time as the duration of a complete [[Global Positioning System#Navigation signals|C/A code cycle]] which is 1 ms. This results in the ability to acquire and track signals down to around the \u2212160 dBW level. High Sensitivity GPS receivers are able to integrate the incoming signals for up to 1,000 times longer than this and therefore acquire signals up to 1,000 times weaker, resulting in an integration gain of 30&nbsp;dB. A good High Sensitivity GPS receiver can acquire signals down to \u2212185 dBW, and tracking can be continued down to levels approaching \u2212190 dBW.\n\nHigh Sensitivity GPS can provide positioning in many but not all [[Indoor positioning system|indoor locations]]. Signals are either heavily [[attenuation|attenuated]] by the building materials or reflected as in [[Multipath propagation|multipath]]. Given that High Sensitivity GPS receivers may be up to 30 [[decibel|dB]] more sensitive, this is sufficient to track through 3 layers of dry bricks, or up to 20&nbsp;cm (8 inches) of steel-reinforced concrete for example.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nExamples of high sensitivity receiver chips include [[SiRFstarIII]] and [[MediaTek]]\u02bcs MTK II.<ref>{{ cite patent | country = US | number = 6674401 | status = Patent | title = High sensitivity GPS receiver and reception | pubdate = 21 August 2003 | gdate = 6 January 2004 | fdate = YYYY-MM-DD | pridate = YYYY-MM-DD | inventor = MCBURNEY PAUL W [US]; WOO ARTHUR N [US] | class = G01S19}}</ref>\n\n== Consumer applications ==\nConsumer GNSS navigation devices include:\n* Dedicated GNSS navigation devices\n* modules that need to be connected to a computer to be used\n* loggers that record trip information for download. Such [[GPS tracking]] is useful for trailblazing, mapping by hikers and cyclists, and the production of [[geocoded photograph]]s.\n* Converged devices, including GPS Phones and [[Auto-geotagging|GPS cameras]], in which GNSS is a feature rather than the main purpose of the device. The majority of GNSS devices are now converged devices, and may use [[assisted GPS]] or standalone (not network dependent) or both. The vulnerability of consumer GNSS to radio frequency interference from [[LightSquared#Interference issues|planned wireless data services]] is controversial.\n\n=== Dedicated GNSS navigation devices ===\n{{see also|automotive navigation system|personal navigation assistant}}\n[[File:GPS Receivers 2007.jpg|thumb|Hand-held receivers]]\n[[Image:KyotoTaxiRide.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Taxicab|taxi]] equipped with GPS]]\n\nDedicated devices have various degrees of mobility. ''Hand-held'', ''outdoor'', or ''sport'' receivers have replaceable batteries that can run them for several hours, making them suitable for [[hiking]], [[bicycle touring]] and other activities far from an electric power source. Their screens are small, and some do not show color, in part to save power. Some use [[transflective liquid-crystal display]]s, allowing use in bright sunlight. Cases are rugged and some are water-resistant.\n\nOther receivers, often called ''mobile'' are intended primarily for use in a car, but have a small rechargeable internal battery that can power them for an hour or two away from the car. Special purpose devices for use in a car may be permanently installed and depend entirely on the automotive electrical system.\n\nThe pre-installed embedded software of early receivers did not display maps; 21st-century ones commonly show interactive street maps (of certain regions) that may also show [[Point of interest|points of interest]], route information and step-by-step routing directions, often in spoken form with a feature called \"[[text to speech]]\".\n\nManufacturers include:\n* [[Navman#Products|Navman products]]\n* [[TomTom#Products|TomTom products]]\n* [[Garmin#Products|Garmin products]]\n* [[Mio Technology|Mio products]]\n* [[Navigon#Products|Navigon products]]\n* [[Magellan Navigation#Consumer products|Magellan Navigation consumer products]]\n* [[Satmap#Active 12|Satmap Systems Ltd]]\n* [[TeleType Co.#Product line|TeleType products]]\n\n=== Integration with smartphones{{anchor|Mobile_phones_with_GPS_capability}} ===\n\nAlmost all [[smartphone]]s now incorporate GNSS receivers{{cn|date=December 2019}}. This has been driven both by consumer demand and by service suppliers. There are now many phone apps that depend on location services, such as navigational aids, and multiple commercial opportunities, such as localised advertising. In its early development, access to user location services was driven by European and American emergency services to help locate callers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poi-factory.com/node/36948|title=Smartphone Offline Navigation Software|work=poi-factory.com}}</ref>.\n\nAll smartphone operating systems offer [[Comparison of free off-line satellite navigation software|free mapping and navigational services]] that require a data connection; some allow the pre-purchase and downloading of maps but the demand for this is diminishing as data connection reliant maps can generally be cached anyway. There are many navigation applications and new versions are constantly being introduced. Major apps include [[Google Maps Navigation]], [[Apple Maps]] and [[Waze]], which require data connections, [[iGO (software)|iGo]] for Android, Maverick and [[Here (company)|HERE]] for Windows Phone, which use cached maps and can operate without a data connection. Consequently, almost any smartphone now qualifies as a [[personal navigation assistant]].\n\nThe use of mobile phones as navigational devices has outstripped the use of standalone GPS devices. In 2009, independent analyst firm Berg Insight found that GPS-enabled GSM/WCDMA handsets in the USA alone numbered 150 million units,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berginsight.com/ReportPDF/Summary/bi-gps4-sum.pdf |title=GPS and Mobile Handsets \u2013 4th edition |date= |accessdate=1 February 2012}}</ref> against the sale of only 40 million standalone GPS receivers.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/15/technology/15iht-navigate.html Kevin J.

Devices</ref>\n\n[[Assisted GPS]] (A-GPS) uses a combination of satellite data and cell tower data to shorten the [[time to first fix]], reduce the need to download a satellite almanac periodically and to help resolve a location when satellite signals are disturbed by the proximity of large buildings. When out of range of a cell tower the location performance of a phone using A-GPS may be reduced. Phones with an A-GPS based [[hybrid positioning system]] can maintain a location fix when GPS signals are inadequate by cell tower triangulation and WiFi hotspot locations.

As the user can choose which software to use, it can be better matched to their personal taste. It is very common for a PC-based GPS receiver to come bundled with a navigation software suite. Also, GPS modules are significantly cheaper than complete stand-alone systems (around [[Euro|\u20ac]]50 to \u20ac100). The software may include maps only for a particular region, or the entire world, if software such as Google Maps are used.\n\nSome hobbyists have also made some GPS devices and open-sourced the plans.

A GPS navigation system can help aviators always know their position and its surroundings in all of its phases starting from its departure all the way to its landing point. Also, a GPS now allows an aviator from start to finish not to have to depend on ground infrastructures and allows them to be able to have a preferred route from its departure and landing point, but not only do they play a part in preferred routes they also help in airports that lack ground-based navigation and surveillance equipment. With the use of a GPS for aviators, it saves time and money being used on fuel. More efficient air routes are continuing to expand every day. There are now some GPS units that allow aviators to get a clearer look in areas where the satellite is augmented to be able to have safe landings in bad visibility conditions. There have now been two new signals made for GPS, the first being made to help in critical conditions in the sky and the other will make GPS more of a robust navigation service.

Using suitable software, the device may display the position on a map, and it may offer routing directions. The [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) is one of a handful of [[satellite navigation|global navigation satellite system]]s (GNSS) made up of a network of a minimum of 24, but currently [[List of GPS satellites|30, satellites]] placed into orbit by the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]].<ref name=\"GPS.gov advice\">{{cite web |last1=US Government|title=GPS.gov|url=http://www.gps.gov/support/faq/#gap1|website=GPS.gov|publisher=US Govt.|accessdate=21 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nGPS was originally developed for use by the United States military, but in the 1980s, the United States government allowed the system to be used for civilian purposes. Though the GPS satellite data is free and works anywhere in the world, the GPS device and the associated software must be bought or rented.\n\nA satellite navigation device can retrieve (from one or more satellite systems) location and time information in all weather conditions, anywhere on or near the Earth. GPS reception requires an unobstructed line of sight to four or more GPS satellites,<ref>{{cite web|title=What is a GPS?|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/scitech/mysteries/global.html}}</ref> and is subject to poor satellite signal conditions. In exceptionally poor signal conditions, for example in urban areas, satellite signals may exhibit [[multipath propagation]] where signals bounce off structures, or are [[Radio propagation#Absorption|weakened]] by meteorological conditions. Obstructed lines of sight may arise from a tree canopy or inside a structure, such as in a building, garage or tunnel. Today, most standalone GPS receivers are used in automobiles. The GPS capability of [[smartphone]]s may use [[assisted GPS]] (A-GPS) technology, which can use the base station or [[cell tower]]s to provide a faster [[Time to First Fix]] (TTFF), especially when GPS signals are poor or unavailable. However, the mobile network part of the A-GPS technology would not be available when the smartphone is outside the range of the mobile reception network, while the GPS aspect would otherwise continue to be available.\n\nThe Russian Global Navigation Satellite System ([[GLONASS]]) was developed contemporaneously with GPS, but suffered from incomplete coverage of the globe until the mid-2000s.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Russia Launches Three More GLONASS-M Space Vehicles|url=http://www.insidegnss.com/node/982|magazine=[[Inside GNSS]]|accessdate=December 26, 2008|date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206081945/http://insidegnss.com/node/982|archive-date=6 February 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> GLONASS can be added to GPS devices to make more satellites available and enabling positions to be fixed more quickly and accurately, to within 2 meters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.clove.co.uk/2012/01/10/glonass-the-future-for-all-smartphones/|title=index.php|author=|date=10 January 2012|website=clove.co.uk|accessdate=3 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nOther satellite navigation services with (intended) global coverage are the European [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]] and the Chinese [[BeiDou]].\n\n==Automotive navigation system==\nUsing satellite information and subject to the sophistication of installed software, a GPS device used as an [[automobile navigation system]] may be used in a number of contexts, including:\n* maps, including street maps, displayed in human-readable format via text or in a graphical format,\n* [[turn-by-turn navigation]] directions to a human in charge of a vehicle or vessel via text or speech,\n* directions fed directly to an [[Autonomous car|autonomous vehicle]] such as a robotic probe,\n* [[traffic congestion map]]s (depicting either historical or real-time data) and suggested alternative directions,\n* information on nearby amenities such as restaurants, fueling stations, and [[tourist attraction]]s.\n\nNavigation devices may be able to indicate:\n* the roads or paths available, \n* traffic congestion and alternative routes,\n* roads or paths that might be taken to get to the destination,\n* if some roads are busy (now or historically) the best route to take,\n* The location of food, banks, hotels, fuel, airports or other places of interests,\n* the shortest route between the two locations,\n* the different options to drive on highway or back roads.\n\n== History ==\n{{See|Global Positioning System#History}}\n\nAs with many other technological breakthroughs of the latter 20th century, the modern GNSS system can reasonably be argued to be a direct outcome of the [[Cold War]] of the latter 20th century. The multibillion-dollar expense of the US'an and Russian programmes was initially justified by military interest; on the contrary the European Galileo was conceived as purely civilian.\n\nIn 1960, the US Navy put into service its [[Transit (satellite)|Transit satellite]] based navigation system to aid in naval navigation. The US Navy in the mid-1960s conducted an experiment to track a submarine with missiles with six satellites and orbiting poles and was able to observe satellite changes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/heo/scan/communications/policy/GPS_History.html|title=Global Positioning System History|last=Mai|first=Thuy|date=August 7, 2017|website=NASA|access-date=April 11, 2019}}</ref> Between 1960 and 1982, as the benefits were been shown, the US military consistently improved and refined its satellite navigation technology and satellite system. In 1973, the US military began to plan for a comprehensive worldwide navigational system which eventually became known as the GPS (global positioning system). In 1983, in the wake of the tragedy of the downing of the [[Korean Airlines Flight 007]], an aircraft which was shot down while in Soviet airspace due to a navigational error, President Reagan made the navigation capabilities of the existing military GPS system available for dual civilian use. However, civilian use was initially only a slightly degraded \"[[Selective Availability]]\" positioning signal. This new availability of the US military GPS system for civilian use required a certain technical collaboration with the private sector for some time, before it could become a commercial reality. In 1989, [[Magellan Navigation|Magellan Navigation Inc.]] unveiled its Magellan NAV 1000, the world\u2019s first commercial handheld GPS receiver. These units initially sold for approximately US$2,900 each. In 2000, the Clinton administration removed the military use signal restrictions, thus providing full commercial access to the US GPS satellite system.\n\nIn 1990, [[Mazda]]'s [[Eunos Cosmo]] was the first production car in the world with a [[automotive navigation system|built-in GPS navigation system]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.motortrend.com/classic/features/12q2_1993_eunos_mazda_cosmo_drive/ |title=1993 Eunos/Mazda Cosmo Classic Drive Uncosmopolitan: Meet the rarest Mazda in America |date=February 2012 |website=Motor Trend |publisher=TEN: The Enthusiast Network |accessdate=18 January 2015}}</ref> In 1991, [[Mitsubishi]] introduced GPS car navigation on the [[Mitsubishi Debonair]] (MMCS: Mitsubishi Multi Communication System).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXd32z5vN18|title=Mitsubishi DEBONAIR Commercial 1991 Japan|last=Sigma Heart|date=16 January 2015|accessdate=3 April 2018|via=YouTube}}</ref> In 1997, a navigation system using [[Differential GPS]] was developed as a factory-installed option on the [[Toyota Prius]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.player-top.fr/|title=Autoradio GPS Android pas cher, Cam\u00e9ra radar de recul - Player Top|website=www.player-top.fr|access-date=2016-07-18}}</ref>\n\nAs GPS navigation systems became more and more widespread and popular, the pricing of such systems began to fall, and their widespread availability steadily increased. Also, several additional manufacturers of these systems, such as [[Garmin]] (1991), [[Twig Com|Benefon]] (1999), [[Mio Technology|Mio]] (2002) and [[TomTom]] (2002) entered the market. Mitac Mio 168 was the first PocketPC to contain a built-in GPS receiver.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pocketgpsworld.com/mitacmio168.php|title=Mitac Mio 168 Review|first=Darren|last=Griffin|date=|website=www.pocketgpsworld.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}</ref> Benefon's 1999 entry into the market also presented users with the world's first phone based GPS navigation system. Later, as smartphone technology developed, a GPS chip eventually became standard equipment for most smartphones. To date, ever more popular satellite navigation systems and devices continue to proliferate with newly developed software and hardware applications. It has been incorporated, for example, into cameras.\n\nWhile the American GPS was the first [[satellite navigation]] system to be deployed on a fully global scale, and to be made available for commercial use, this is not the only system of its type. Due to military and other concerns, similar global or regional systems have been, or will soon be deployed by Russia, the European Union, China, India, and Japan.\n\nGNSS have made many strides into today\u2019s world. It can now help out in things such as parents now using GNSS devices to attach to their kids to monitor their movement and always know their location. Also helps out with detecting the movements and behavior of animals and also helps officers with car chases and not having to chase exactly behind a criminal and lastly using GPS bullets to catch criminals.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-26153506|title=GPS: From launch to everyday life|last=Rice|first=Carolyn|date=February 15, 2014|work=BBC News|access-date=April 27, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Sensitivity ==\nGNSS devices vary in sensitivity, speed, vulnerability to [[multipath propagation]], and other performance parameters. '''High Sensitivity''' receivers use large banks of correlators{{clarify|date=June 2016}}{{cit|date=June 2016}} and [[digital signal processing]] to search for signals very quickly. This results in very fast [[time to first fix|times to first fix]] when the signals are at their normal levels, for example outdoors. When signals are weak, for example indoors, the extra processing power can be used to integrate weak signals to the point where they can be used to provide a position or timing solution.\n\nGNSS signals are already very weak when they arrive at the Earth\u2019s surface. The [[GPS satellite]]s only transmit 27&nbsp;W (14.3&nbsp;dBW) from a distance of 20,200&nbsp;km in [[orbit]] above the Earth. By the time the signals arrive at the user's receiver, they are typically as weak as \u2212160 [[dBW]], equivalent to one-tenth of a million-billionth of a watt (100&nbsp;attowatts). This is well below the thermal noise level in its bandwidth. Outdoors, GPS signals are typically around the \u2212155 dBW level (\u2212125 [[dBm]]).\n\nConventional GPS receivers integrate the received GPS signals for the same amount of time as the duration of a complete [[Global Positioning System#Navigation signals|C/A code cycle]] which is 1 ms. This results in the ability to acquire and track signals down to around the \u2212160 dBW level. High Sensitivity GPS receivers are able to integrate the incoming signals for up to 1,000 times longer than this and therefore acquire signals up to 1,000 times weaker, resulting in an integration gain of 30&nbsp;dB. A good High Sensitivity GPS receiver can acquire signals down to \u2212185 dBW, and tracking can be continued down to levels approaching \u2212190 dBW.\n\nHigh Sensitivity GPS can provide positioning in many but not all [[Indoor positioning system|indoor locations]]. Signals are either heavily [[attenuation|attenuated]] by the building materials or reflected as in [[Multipath propagation|multipath]]. Given that High Sensitivity GPS receivers may be up to 30 [[decibel|dB]] more sensitive, this is sufficient to track through 3 layers of dry bricks, or up to 20&nbsp;cm (8 inches) of steel-reinforced concrete for example.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nExamples of high sensitivity receiver chips include [[SiRFstarIII]] and [[MediaTek]]\u02bcs MTK II.<ref>{{ cite patent | country = US | number = 6674401 | status = Patent | title = High sensitivity GPS receiver and reception | pubdate = 21 August 2003 | gdate = 6 January 2004 | fdate = YYYY-MM-DD | pridate = YYYY-MM-DD | inventor = MCBURNEY PAUL W [US]; WOO ARTHUR N [US] | class = G01S19}}</ref>\n\n== Consumer applications ==\nConsumer GNSS navigation devices include:\n* Dedicated GNSS navigation devices\n* modules that need to be connected to a computer to be used\n* loggers that record trip information for download. Such [[GPS tracking]] is useful for trailblazing, mapping by hikers and cyclists, and the production of [[geocoded photograph]]s.\n* Converged devices, including GPS Phones and [[Auto-geotagging|GPS cameras]], in which GNSS is a feature rather than the main purpose of the device. The majority of GNSS devices are now converged devices, and may use [[assisted GPS]] or standalone (not network dependent) or both. The vulnerability of consumer GNSS to radio frequency interference from [[LightSquared#Interference issues|planned wireless data services]] is controversial.\n\n=== Dedicated GNSS navigation devices ===\n{{see also|automotive navigation system|personal navigation assistant}}\n[[File:GPS Receivers 2007.jpg|thumb|Hand-held receivers]]\n[[Image:KyotoTaxiRide.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Taxicab|taxi]] equipped with GPS]]\n\nDedicated devices have various degrees of mobility. ''Hand-held'', ''outdoor'', or ''sport'' receivers have replaceable batteries that can run them for several hours, making them suitable for [[hiking]], [[bicycle touring]] and other activities far from an electric power source. Their screens are small, and some do not show color, in part to save power. Some use [[transflective liquid-crystal display]]s, allowing use in bright sunlight. Cases are rugged and some are water-resistant.\n\nOther receivers, often called ''mobile'' are intended primarily for use in a car, but have a small rechargeable internal battery that can power them for an hour or two away from the car. Special purpose devices for use in a car may be permanently installed and depend entirely on the automotive electrical system.\n\nThe pre-installed embedded software of early receivers did not display maps; 21st-century ones commonly show interactive street maps (of certain regions) that may also show [[Point of interest|points of interest]], route information and step-by-step routing directions, often in spoken form with a feature called \"[[text to speech]]\".\n\nManufacturers include:\n* [[Navman#Products|Navman products]]\n* [[TomTom#Products|TomTom products]]\n* [[Garmin#Products|Garmin products]]\n* [[Mio Technology|Mio products]]\n* [[Navigon#Products|Navigon products]]\n* [[Magellan Navigation#Consumer products|Magellan Navigation consumer products]]\n* [[Satmap#Active 12|Satmap Systems Ltd]]\n* [[TeleType Co.#Product line|TeleType products]]\n\n=== Integration with smartphones{{anchor|Mobile_phones_with_GPS_capability}} ===\n\nAlmost all [[smartphone]]s now incorporate GNSS receivers{{cn|date=December 2019}}. This has been driven both by consumer demand and by service suppliers. There are now many phone apps that depend on location services, such as navigational aids, and multiple commercial opportunities, such as localised advertising. In its early development, access to user location services was driven by European and American emergency services to help locate callers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poi-factory.com/node/36948|title=Smartphone Offline Navigation Software|work=poi-factory.com}}</ref>.\n\nAll smartphone operating systems offer [[Comparison of free off-line satellite navigation software|free mapping and navigational services]] that require a data connection; some allow the pre-purchase and downloading of maps but the demand for this is diminishing as data connection reliant maps can generally be cached anyway. There are many navigation applications and new versions are constantly being introduced. Major apps include [[Google Maps Navigation]], [[Apple Maps]] and [[Waze]], which require data connections, [[iGO (software)|iGo]] for Android, Maverick and [[Here (company)|HERE]] for Windows Phone, which use cached maps and can operate without a data connection. Consequently, almost any smartphone now qualifies as a [[personal navigation assistant]].\n\nThe use of mobile phones as navigational devices has outstripped the use of standalone GPS devices. In 2009, independent analyst firm Berg Insight found that GPS-enabled GSM/WCDMA handsets in the USA alone numbered 150 million units,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berginsight.com/ReportPDF/Summary/bi-gps4-sum.pdf |title=GPS and Mobile Handsets \u2013 4th edition |date= |accessdate=1 February 2012}}</ref> against the sale of only 40 million standalone GPS receivers.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/15/technology/15iht-navigate.html Kevin J.

Devices</ref>\n\n[[Assisted GPS]] (A-GPS) uses a combination of satellite data and cell tower data to shorten the [[time to first fix]], reduce the need to download a satellite almanac periodically and to help resolve a location when satellite signals are disturbed by the proximity of large buildings. When out of range of a cell tower the location performance of a phone using A-GPS may be reduced. Phones with an A-GPS based [[hybrid positioning system]] can maintain a location fix when GPS signals are inadequate by cell tower triangulation and WiFi hotspot locations.

As the user can choose which software to use, it can be better matched to their personal taste. It is very common for a PC-based GPS receiver to come bundled with a navigation software suite. Also, GPS modules are significantly cheaper than complete stand-alone systems (around [[Euro|\u20ac]]50 to \u20ac100). The software may include maps only for a particular region, or the entire world, if software such as Google Maps are used.\n\nSome hobbyists have also made some GPS devices and open-sourced the plans.

A GPS navigation system can help aviators always know their position and its surroundings in all of its phases starting from its departure all the way to its landing point. Also, a GPS now allows an aviator from start to finish not to have to depend on ground infrastructures and allows them to be able to have a preferred route from its departure and landing point, but not only do they play a part in preferred routes they also help in airports that lack ground-based navigation and surveillance equipment. With the use of a GPS for aviators, it saves time and money being used on fuel. More efficient air routes are continuing to expand every day. There are now some GPS units that allow aviators to get a clearer look in areas where the satellite is augmented to be able to have safe landings in bad visibility conditions. There have now been two new signals made for GPS, the first being made to help in critical conditions in the sky and the other will make GPS more of a robust navigation service. Many aviator services have now made it a required service to use a GPS.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gps.gov/applications/aviation/|title=Aviation|author=U.S. Air Force|date=October 3, 2018|website=GPS.gov|publisher=National Coordination Office for Space-Based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing.|access-date=April 11, 2019}}</ref> Commercial aviation applications include GPS devices that calculate location and feed that information to large multi-input navigational computers for [[autopilot]], course information and correction displays to the pilots, and course tracking and recording devices.\n\n== Military ==\nMilitary applications include devices similar to consumer sport products for foot soldiers (commanders and regular soldiers), small vehicles and ships, and devices similar to commercial aviation applications for aircraft and missiles.

The Magic play their home games at Mandurah Aquatic & Recreation Centre.\n\n==Club history==\nThe [[City of Mandurah|Mandurah]]/[[Peel (Western Australia)|Peel]] region was represented in the [[State Basketball League]] (SBL) for the first time in 1990 in the form of a men's team known as the Kanyana Kings. The Kings saw immediate success in their first season with forward [[Vince Kelley]] and centre Carl Gonder leading them to a second-place finish and a 20\u20136 record.<ref name=kanyana>{{cite web | url=http://websites.sportstg.com/assoc_page.cgi?c=1-4810-0-0-0&sID=83492&news_task=DETAIL&articleID=15832907 | title=MANDURAH MAGIC/KANYANA KINGS PAST PLAYERS NIGHT | work=SportsTG.com | date=25 May 2011 | accessdate=23 March 2017}}</ref> This inaugural season is still the best campaign in the history of the men's team, with the team having failed to finish second or higher or set such a win-loss record since.<ref name=guide>{{cite web | url=http://websites.sportstg.com/get_file.cgi?id=3521417 | title=2015 SBL Media Guide | work=SportsTG.com | accessdate=22 March 2017 | page=37}}</ref> The Kanyana name was dropped in 1994 before a full rebrand to the Magic took place in 1996 alongside the inclusion of a women's team.<ref name=\"kanyana\" /><ref name=\"guide\" />\n\nSeason 2003 marked the club's most successful season in their 14-year history, with the women's team reaching the WSBL Grand Final for the first time.

Approximately 10% of the population are immigrants. The unemployment rate in the commune has persistently been one of the highest in France, standing at over 20% in 2004.\n\nThe inhabitants of the commune are known as ''Bastiais'' or ''Bastiaises''.<ref>[http://www.habitants.fr/haute-corse-2B Inhabitants of Haute-Corse] {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\nThe commune has been awarded '''three flowers''' by the ''National Council of Towns and Villages in Bloom'' in the ''Competition of cities and villages in Bloom''.<ref>[http://www.cnvvf.fr/les_villes_et_village_fleuris-47.html Competition for Towns and Villages in Bloom website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210053901/http://www.cnvvf.fr/les_villes_et_village_fleuris-47.html |date=10 December 2014 }} {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\nLocated in the North-East of [[Corsica]] at the base of the [[Cap Corse]], between the [[sea]] and the mountain, Bastia is the principal [[port]] of the island. The city is located {{convert|35|km|0|abbr=on}} away from the northern tip of the Cap Corse, {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} west from [[Elba]], an Italian island, and {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=on}} away from continental [[Italy]] which can be seen a few days per year when visibility is excellent.\n\n[[File:Bastia Serra di Pigno.jpg|thumb|alt=Bastia seen from the \"Pigno\"|left|The city of Bastia as seen from the \"Pigno\": notice the lack of constructions in the foreground and the city along the coast in the background]]\n\nIn terms of geography, Bastia is defined by its position between the sea and the mountain. The city is located on the Eastern side of the \"Serra di Pignu\", a {{convert|960|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} mountain (see photo opposite). This steep mountain and several hills in the city shape a relief typical of the [[Cap Corse]]. This pronounced landscape caused the city to develop mostly on a coastal band about {{convert|1.5|km|0|abbr=on}} wide, which is a very limited part of the {{convert|19.38|km\u00b2|2|abbr=on}} that the [[commune]] has.\n\nAbove all, Bastia is a [[port]], and the [[sea]] has of course a significant role in the spatial organization of the city. Bastia possesses nowadays three different [[port]]s. The old port (\"Vieux Port\" in [[French language|French]] and \"Portu Vechju\" in [[Corsican language|Corsican]]), located in a remarkable and narrow cove, offers good natural shelter against the climatic hazards of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Thus, it was at the core of the initial development of the city. Nowadays, many pleasure and fishing boats are still there, but it is not as economically vital than the other more modern ports, although its touristic and aesthetic charm almost makes the old port the official emblem of the city. In fact, many caf\u00e9s, bars and restaurants have moved to its docks to which access is granted by the city for pedestrians only during summer evenings.\n\nA bit more to the North is located the commercial and ferry port. As a major economic asset of the city, the \"port de commerce\" is the pulse of the city. It is even more so during the summer when ferry arrivals and departures of thousands of passengers and cars can sometimes cause long traffic jams along the north\u2013south axis, the national road RN193. In front of the commercial port, the large Saint-Nicolas square represents the heart of the city. Just North of the commercial port, the Toga [[marina]], named after a city neighborhood, is a harbor for leisure boating activities like sailing and yachting. There are also some bars, restaurants and night clubs on its docks.\n\nThus, Bastia is logically organized on a relatively narrow north\u2013south axis which can make access to the city centre difficult under particular circumstances. Nowadays, the city centre is mainly composed of the \"citadelle\", the stronghold, also called Terra-Nova, with the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] Governors' Palace, the old port and its popular quarter and the market plaza, and finally the ensemble of buildings along the \"Boulevard Paoli\", the main commercial street of the city, which lies from the Justice Court to the Avenue Mar\u00e9chal Sebastiani.\n\nDuring the last few decades, Bastia and its region have experienced a strong demographic growth, which has cause somewhat of a suburban crawl in the South of the city, because of the congestion of the city center.\n\n{{Geographic location\n|title='''Neighbouring communes and villages'''<ref name=Google/><ref name=Geo/>\n|Centre    = Bastia \n|North     = [[Ville-di-Pietrabugno]]\n|Northeast = [[Tyrrhenian Sea]]\n|East      = Tyrrhenian Sea\n|Southeast = Tyrrhenian Sea\n|South     = [[Furiani]]\n|Southwest = [[Barbaggio]]\n|West      = [[Patrimonio]]\n|Northwest = [[Farinole]]\n}}\n\n===Geology and relief===\nThe commune is located in the Alpine Eastern Corsica region <ref group=\"Note\">This region consists of a range of terrain resulting from a vanished ocean called ''Liguro-Piedmont'' (in the [[Tethys ocean]] whose age is between 170 to 60 Million years old) and its continental margins. The age of the Alpine Corsica region ranges from [[Triassic]] to recent.</ref> which is formed from \"a succession of [[Autochthon (geology)|Autochthons]] (fixed terrain), para-Autochtons (weakly displaced terrain) and especially [[Allochthon]]s (highly displaced terrain). The first two coincide roughly with the central depression. The Allochtons are mainly in the area of lustrous [[schist]]s and [[ophiolite]]s corresponding to the eastern relief ([[Cap Corse]] and Castagniccia)\".<ref>[http://cgo.asso.free.fr/telechargement/LaCorse2010.doc ''Corsica \u2013 Simplified Geological Map of Corsica''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304034551/http://cgo.asso.free.fr/telechargement/LaCorse2010.doc |date=4 March 2016 }}, Geology Centre of Oisans p. 6 {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\nIts base rests on a granite bedrock ([[Felsic]] granites from the [[Hercynian]], plain rocks), which has been covered with oceanic layers of:\n\n* Sedimentary rocks ([[Miocene]] to [[Quaternary]]) on the east coast, ranging from the mouth of the ''Ruisseau de Lupino'' north to the south bank of the mouth of the Travo\n* lustrous [[schist]]s along the entire eastern side of Cap Corse,\n* ophiolite deposited in eastern Corsica during the [[Eocene]] period.\n\nNote the presence of [[copper]] ore in Cardo which was once the subject of a concession.\n\nGeographically, Bastia is characterized by its location between the sea and the mountains. The commune lies on the eastern flank of the \"Serra di Pignu\" a mountain which rises to 960 m above sea level. This steep mountain with other hills around Bastia forms the typical terrain of Cap Corse. This pronounced relief largely explains the development of the city on a coastal strip of about 1.5&nbsp;km in width which is a very limited proportion of the 19.38 km2 of the whole commune.\n\n===Hydrography===\nThe river network is sparse. There are three small streams (or ''fiumes'') flowing from west to east:\n\n* in the north the Ruisseau Fiuminale rises in the north-west of the commune 400 m north-east of Monte Muzzone (920 m).<ref>{{Sandre|Y7320540|Ruisseau Fiuminale|consulted on 5 July 2015}} {{in lang|fr}}</ref> Along its length of 4.3 kilometres it forms the border between the communes of Bastia and [[Ville-di-Pietrabugno]] from its source to the roundabout of the Annunciation. Part of its course is covered in the city from the path of the Annunciation to the port where it empties into the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]].

A portion of about 23&nbsp;km is 2X2 lanes between Arena and [[Vescovato, Haute-Corse|Vescovato]] since the inauguration of the \"expressway Borgo-Vescovato\" in January 2013. This is the major road axis into the Bastia region because it connects the city of Bastia directly or indirectly to all other Corsican towns (Ajaccio, [[Corte, Haute-Corse|Corte]], [[Porto-Vecchio]], [[Calvi, Haute-Corse|Calvi]] etc.) while also passing through the main cities of the peripheral region of Bastia such as [[Furiani]], [[Biguglia]], [[Borgo, Haute-Corse|Borgo]], and [[Lucciana]] where [[Bastia Poretta Airport]] is located. This road is also called the ''Waterfront Route'' from the Montesoro district because it runs along the seafront up to the Old Port Tunnel which runs under the citadel and the Old Port. This road ultimately ends at Ajaccio.\n* from the West:, by the D81, a road which goes to [[Saint-Florent, Haute-Corse|Saint-Florent]] via the Col de Teghime.\n* from the North: by the D80, which goes in a loop around Cap Corse (the road between Bastia and Pietranera was opened in 1829).\n\nThe road distance to other towns and cities in Corsica is:\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* 10&nbsp;km to [[Santa-Maria-di-Lota]]\n* 12&nbsp;km to [[Brando, Haute-Corse|Brando]]\n* 18&nbsp;km to [[Patrimonio]]\n* 19&nbsp;km to [[Borgo, Haute-Corse|Borgo]]\n* 20&nbsp;km to [[Oletta]]\n* 23&nbsp;km to [[Murato, Haute-Corse|Murato]]\n* 24&nbsp;km to [[Saint-Florent, Haute-Corse|Saint-Florent]]\n* 26&nbsp;km to [[Vescovato, Haute-Corse|Vescovato]]\n* 29&nbsp;km to [[Luri, Haute-Corse|Luri]]\n* 33&nbsp;km to [[Nonza]]\n* 34&nbsp;km to [[Volpajola]]\n* 36&nbsp;km to [[Macinaggio]]\n* 40&nbsp;km to [[Rogliano, Haute-Corse|Rogliano]]\n* 46&nbsp;km to [[Canari]]\n* 47&nbsp;km to [[Ponte-Leccia]]\n* 48&nbsp;km to [[Centuri, Haute-Corse|Centuri]]\n* 49&nbsp;km to [[Cervione]]\n* 68&nbsp;km to [[Corte, Haute-Corse|Corte]]\n* 68&nbsp;km to [[L'\u00cele-Rousse]]\n* 73&nbsp;km to [[Al\u00e9ria]]\n* 92&nbsp;km to [[Calvi, Haute-Corse|Calvi]]\n* 129&nbsp;km to [[Vico, Corse-du-Sud|Vico]]\n* 143&nbsp;km to [[Porto-Vecchio]]\n* 145&nbsp;km to [[Zicavo]]\n* 147&nbsp;km to [[Ajaccio]]\n* 171&nbsp;km to [[Bonifacio, Corse-du-Sud|Bonifacio]]\n* 179&nbsp;km to [[Sart\u00e8ne]]\n* 181&nbsp;km to [[Propriano]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Bus transport===\nThe urban area of Bastia is served by a bus network with 14 routes operated by the Autobus Bastiais company.<ref>[http://www.bastiabus.com/ ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Autobus Bastiais''] Official website {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\n===Rail transport===\nThe Bastia railway station belongs to [[Chemins de Fer de la Corse]] and is located in the city centre.

This territory was occupied by the Vanacimi people.<ref>[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b5963841x.r=Italia+antica+Tolomeo.langFR Map ''Italia antica Cl.

Shortly afterwards, considering the great expense and little profit in Corsica, the Republic decided to withdraw and no longer intervene in the affairs of the island. Nevertheless some Genoese gentlemen formed a partnership known as the [[Maona]] to try and manage the economy on the island on behalf of the Republic of Genoa. The five partners were: Leonello Lomellino, Giovanni da Balagnera, Aluigi Tortorino, Andreolo Ficone, and Cristoforo Maruffo. They all came with the title of Governor and brought with them a thousand soldiers.<ref name=\"Grossa\">Giovanni della Grossa in ''Croniche'', translation by Lucien Auguste Letteron: ''History of Corsica \u2013 Vol. 1'' {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\nAfter an expedition to Cinarca followed by a short period of peace, Leonello Lomellino returned as governor and to gain an advantage over the Count [[Arrigo della Rocca]] with whom he would have to fight, he began by fortifying [[Al\u00e9ria]]. \" Then Count Arrigo and his allies once again crossed the mountains and made incursions against Cap Corse: having met no resistance, they went to besiege Al\u00e9ria which capitulated after four months. Leonello, deprived of all support, returned to [[Biguglia]] and from there he went to build the castle of Bastia to maintain his sea communications\".<ref name=\"Grossa\"/> <ref group=\"Note\">In a footnote (p. 233) to ''History of Corsica'' \u2013 Vol. I, Abbot Letteron wrote: \"The foundation of Bastia is generally fixed on the year 1378 but ''The Bastia'' was not built until a few years later as there were several wars between that event and the institution of the Maona\" {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\n\"Between the second half of the 12th century and the middle of the 13th century the feudal system was in place at all levels of society and new links were created between the elite of the aristocracy and the Maritime Republics, between representatives of the island's nobility, and between them and the poor. At the same time castles multiplied. They were then owned by fifteen noble families of local or peninsular origin, sometimes fragmented into independent lordships or even [sic] rivals: {{ill|Bagnaia family|lt=Bagnaia|fr|Famille De Bagnaia}}, Amondaschi, Cortinchi, Pinaschi de Coasini, Lotreto de Nebbio, Loreto de Casinca, Orezza, Avogari, Camilla, Turca, Pevere, de Mari (from the mid-13th century only), and the ''Marquis de Massa and Corsica''\".\n\n\u2013  Daniel Istria \u2013 Powers and fortifications in northern Corsica 11th \u2013 14th Century p.&nbsp;145\n\nAccording to Giovanni della Grossa, the \"seigneurialisation\" of Loreto would have beene, as with Genoese families of the Cape, usurping the County title acquired during the \"people's government\". Small lordships that emerged from the courts of the Bishop of Nebbio, probably sometime in the second half of the 12th century or the beginning of the 13th century, were partly absorbed by the lords of Bagnaia before 1247. Then, before 1289, they were recovered and absorbed, like many others in the new lordship of Giovanninello de Loreto. Taking advantage of the Genoese-pisano rivalries, he extended his possessions to the east and west.\n\nWritten documentation illustrates the business of territorial conquest conducted by Giovanninello during the years 1260\u20131280. After raiding the castles of Nebbio and Pureto in the Ostriconi, he went on to the conquest of the pieve of [[Orto]], which was then under the control of Bagnaia, and he built two new fortifications: Montebello and Petra di Bugno. These were intended not only to dominate and control the northern part of Bagnaia, whose Cerlino Lake had a certain economic interest, but probably also to neutralise Porto Cardo, which occupied a strategic military position as well as having businesses. It was here that the fortress of Bastia was erected, the residence of the Genoese governors from the 15th century. The agreements between Giovanninello and the commune of Genoa in 1289 demonstrated the importance of this baronial control of land routes and anchorages, a major source of revenue and a guarantee of the security of the territory.<ref>Daniel Istria \u2013 ''Powers and Fortifications in the north of Corsica 11th\u201314th century'' p. 122 {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\n===Originally Cardo===\n[[File:Bastia maison-tour la Vetrice Cardo.jpg|thumb|La Vetrice Tower]]\n\nBefore the occupation of Corsica by the Genoese there were several communities of the pieve of [[Orto]]: Soverta, La Vetrice, Belgodere, Astima, and Le Corbaia. All these villages have today almost disappeared. On the coast there was a small hamlet inhabited by fishermen called Porto Cardo which means \"Cardo Port\".\n\n===Modern times===\n[[File:CitadelleBastia.jpg|thumb|The citadel, built by the Genoese]]\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries the [[Franciscans]] settled in the Pieve of Orto.\n\nAt the beginning of the 16th century, Monseigneur Agostino [[Giustiniani]], Bishop of Nebbio, described in his ''Dialogo nominato  Corsica'':\n\n\"[...] The pieve of [[Orto]] is almost ruined; it contains 340 [[feu fiscal|fires]]. In this pi\u00e8ve is Biguglia with a convent of [[Friars Minor]] [...]. With Biguglia there are still these pi\u00e8ves: Furiani, Belgodere, Soverta, La Vetrice, and Corbaia; nowadays, all these villages have almost disappeared.\"\n\n\u2013  Agostino Giustiniani in ''Description of Corsica'', translation by Lucien Auguste Letteron in ''History of Corsica'', Bulletin of the Society for Historical and Natural Sciences of Corsica \u2013 Volume I \u2013 1888, p.&nbsp;50. {{in lang|fr}}\n\nContinuing, he writes:\n\n\"It is in this pi\u00e8ve Bastia lies, home to the Bishop and Governor of Corsica. Before the last war this city had 700 houses divided into two districts: Terranova and Terravecchia. There was formerly in this place a castle or tower, or rather a fortress of the kind called on the continent ''Bastie'' [...]. Terravecchia was an open area which is now burned and ruined largely as a result of the war. The land is very steep on the lower slopes and walking is very painful; on the other hand the Terranova area is generally flat, with fairly wide streets and many modern houses. It is surrounded not only by a solid wall, which forms a continuous enclosure, but a wide and deep moat and magnificent bastions. The wall was begun in the time of Tomasino de Campofregoso, then lord of the island, and completed later through the efforts of the [[Bank of Saint George]]. The bastions and the moat were made by that same bank and by the Genoese government during the last war. The bank has added a very beautiful citadel but the benefits do not match the expense it required during its construction; it cost, in fact, 25,000 [[ducat]]s. Bastia has two convents of [[Friars Minor]], one of [[Recollects]], and the other [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]]. This city, being the governor's residence, prospered greatly but it also had much to suffer in recent wars. Although the main centre on the island many people were of the opinion that its importance will hardly increase. The first reason they give is that the population of the city is composed of Genoese and Corsicans: the Genoese, from Rivi\u00e8res, belong to the lower class. Most Corsicans also belonged in this class. There is a jealousy and rivalry between the inhabitants of Bastia so great that few mind the interests of the city: they apply themselves only to deceit and to oust each other and that is where we get all the evil. The second reason is that the city has no port. It has in fact a small bay where it is possible to relax on small boats. On the other hand, houses, until now, have been very poorly distributed. There is not one that has a stable nor even a well or a cistern, so that it is necessary to fetch water from the fountain outside. Also in summer the water is very hot because it comes from far away via an [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]].\n\nThe cellars are far from being good. Bastia is built on a rocky ground, where ducts and sewers can be dug only with great difficulty. The city has no pleasant walks and is also very exposed to the West Wind which sometimes lasts for eight or ten days, so we can not leave home because the wind is so strong that it shakes the houses. What is more advantageous for Bastia is to be near fertile country that produces some wine, such as at Cap Corse, and elsewhere wheat, as on the higher pi\u00e8ves. There is a at the doorstep and only a short distance from Piombino and other mainland locations. It is for these reasons, and not for others, that the Board has chosen Bastia to make the residence of its governors: because there is nowhere on the island where the governor would be better off than at Bastia\".\n\n\u2013  Agostino Giustiniani in ''Description of Corsica'', translation by Lucien Auguste Letteron in ''History of Corsica''. {{in lang|fr}}\n\nHe ends his description as follows:\n\n\"There were still in the pi\u00e8ve of Orto two small villages with the main pieve church dedicated to Saint Mary. These two villages and the church were ruined after the last [[Bubonis plague|plague]] and also because of the negligence of the pi\u00e9vans. After Porraggia comes Punta d'Arco and the Chiurlino Lake, about ten miles long, which can be entered only by very small boats. In this lake is an island, where there is good hunting for [[wild boar]]. This place is called the island. There are also two other small islands where fishermen stay: one is called ''Ischia nova'' which became famous in the recent wars and the other is called ''Ischia Vacchia''. There is fishing in this lake for ''cephalic'' (cefalu or mazzardi), [[Mullet (fish)|mullet]] (muggini), and other fish that make excellent [[Botargo]]. These fish and eels are taken in large quantities and serve as ordinary food for the inhabitants of Bastia, not to mention the fish that comes from the pi\u00e8ves of Orto, Mariana and Mercurio. Then comes the Port of Lo Pino then the Gulf of Bastia, which is called ''Portocardo'' by the sailors. There is then the Ruisseau de S. Nicolas, then successively the Port of Toga, Grigione, the port and Ruisseau di Pietranera where there is a tower.\"\n\n\u2013  Agostino Giustiniani in ''Description of Corsica'', translation by Lucien Auguste Letteron in ''History of Corsica''. {{in lang|fr}}\n\n===The Genoese era===\nThe Genoese soon felt the need to protect Bastia from invasions coming from the sea and began to build a bastiglia (moat) and a citadel in the time of governor Leonello Lomellini.\n\nOver time, the ''Bastiglia'' (Bastia) has grown, become prosperous, and become more important than Cardo.\n\nIts history is in its \"bastiglia\" or citadel which was originally a walled city. Here it was the sea and the mountains that determined the location of habitations as well as the relief of the island. Bastia was the capital at the time of the Genoese domination. It spread to the slopes later, drawn toward the water in the ''Place Saint-Nicolas''.\n\nCreated by the Genoese patrician Leonello Lomellini in 1353 to liaise with Genoa, the city originated on the roack where a tower was built ( a ''bastiglia'', hence its name) and, a hundred years later, was surrounded by walls.\n\nAt the beginning of the 18th century, many improvements were made in the Punta district, where many shops were built. Bastia and the whole island came under French military domination on 8 May 1769.\n\nIn 1794, during a war with [[Revolutionary France]], British troops under [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Admiral Nelson]] and Lieutenant-General [[David Dundas (British Army officer)|David Dundas]] briefly [[Siege of Bastia|captured Bastia]].\n\nIn 1848 Bastia took 44 hectares from [[Ville-di-Pietrabugno]].\n\n===Contemporary period===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\n{{see also|Italian occupation of Corsica}}\nBastia suffered much damage during the [[Second World War]]. Nevertheless Corsica was the first department to be liberated on 4 October 1943 by the Corsican resistance in the ''Pearl Harbor secret mission'' (sent by the secret services of the military defence establishment in [[Algiers]]) and the submarine ''[[French submarine Casabianca (1935)|Casabianca]]''.\n\nThe commandos of the secret mission (Roger de Saule, Laurent Preziosi, the cousins Toussaint, and Pierre Griffi) landed in the night of 13 to 14 December 1942 from the submarine Casabianca in the Bay of Topiti. After organizing a network in this region (Piana), they then moved to organize a 2nd network at Corte led locally by Pascal Valentini, finally heading for Bastia to organise a 3rd network in the Bastia and Cap Corse region. It was around Hyacinthe de Montera, specifically at 35 Boulevard Paoli, that the movement was organized. Laurent Preziosi had already participated in the first meetings in 1941 before returning to Algiers to be recruited for the mission. The movement then organized within the [[National Front (French Resistance)|National Front]]. The radioman, Pierre Griffi was arrested in Ajaccio, severely tortured, and shot in Bastia without talking on 18 August 1943.\n\nThe turret of the submarine ''Casabianca'' is displayed at the corner of the ''Place Saint-Nicolas'' on the sea side. A commemorative stone of the first meeting was affixed to 35 boulevard Paoli (above the door).\n\nAfter the war, Bastia gradually emerged as a key economic centre of Corsica. The Bastia agglomeration is the most extensive on the island.\n\nDuring the last fifty years Cardo had the second homes of wealthy Bastiais. Currently Cardo is a district of Bastia on the heights of Pigno. It attracts many people who want to live there as it has all the advantages of a village in the countryside while being close to the city.\n\n===Heraldry===\n{{Blazon-arms\n|img1=Blason Ville fr Bastia.svg\n|legend1=Arms of Bastia \n|text=\n\n'''Blazon:'''<br/>\n''Azure, a fortress Argent, turreted, masoned, windows, and port of Sable on a terrace in base Vert.''\n}}\n\n==Administration==\n'''List of Successive [[Mayor (France)|Mayors]]'''<ref>[http://www.francegenweb.org/mairesgenweb/resultcommune.php?id=7677 List of Mayors of France] {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\n{{Hidden begin\n|title=[[Mayor (France)|Mayors]] from 1770 to 1941\n|titlestyle = background:palegreen;\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In 2015 SC Bastia played and lost the final of the League Cup against PSG, 20 years after playing them in the same competition in 1995. The club currently plays in [[Ligue 1]].<ref>[http://www.sc-bastia.corsica/?page_id=22 SAC Bastia website] {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\nBesides SC Bastia there are two other amateur football clubs: [[CA Bastia]] who currently play in the [[Championnat National]] and [[\u00c9F Bastia]]. A fourth club, the ''Football Corsica Club Bastiais'' (FCCB) disappeared after playing in six amateur championships in Corsica in the 1950s Historically each of these four clubs was supported by a different part of the city: the Place Saint-Nicolas district were blue (SC Bastia), the Old Port was black (CA Bastia), the citadel and the Saint Joseph district were white (EF Bastia), and the market area was red (FCCB). Sporting dominance has overshadowed other clubs in Bastia over time. At the end of the 2012/2013 season there were for the first time two professional clubs in Bastia: SC Bastia in Ligue 1 and the CA Bastia promoted from National, for a total of four Corsican professional football clubs (with [[AC Ajaccio]] in Ligue 1 and [[GFC Ajaccio]], relegated to National but retaining its professional status).\n\nBastia was also a city-stage in the [[Tour de France 2013]]: the arrival point  of the first stage from [[Porto-Vecchio]] and starting point for the second to [[Ajaccio]].\n\nBastia is currently the headquarters for the French round of the [[FIA World Rally Championship]].\n\n==Town planning==\n[[File:Citadelle Bastia.jpg|thumb|View from the Citadel]]\n[[File:VP-Bastia.jpg|thumb|Coloured fa\u00e7ades in the Old Port]]\n\nBastia is primarily a port city so the sea has a predominant place in the spatial organization of the city. Nowadays Bastia has three different ports.\n\n* The '''Old Port:''' located in a narrow cove that offers good protection against the Mediterranean weather. It was therefore at the heart of the initial development of the city. Today it still is home to many yachts and fishing boats but it is not so economically vital for the city than the other modern ports, although its tourism and aesthetic appeal makes it an almost official emblem of Bastia. Many bar-cafes and restaurants have opened on its quays whose streets are pedestrian access only in the summer.\n* The '''Commercial Port''': a little north of the Old Port, it is the major economic asset of the city. This is especially true in the summer period when thousands of arrivals and departures of passengers and vehicles can sometimes cause long traffic jams along [[Route nationale]] N193 despite the existence of a tunnel under the Old Port. Opposite the commercial port is the vast ''Place Saint Nicolas'' which is the heart of the city.\n* The '''Toga Marina''': north of the commercial port partly in [[Ville-di-Pietrabugno]] is occupied by many sailboats and yachts. There are also several bars, restaurants and nightclubs on its quays.\n\n===The city centre and outlying urban areas===\nToday the city centre consists mainly of the citadel (also called ''Terra Nova''), the Palace of the Governors, the Old Port with its surrounding neighbourhood and the market place, and finally all the buildings along the Paoli Boulevard \u2013 the main commercial street of the city which stretches from the courthouse to the Avenue Mar\u00e9chal Sebastiani.\n\nIn recent decades Bastia and its region have had strong demographic growth which has now grown beyond the municipal boundaries.\n[[File:Cardu.JPG|thumb|The Village of Cardo]]\nBastia has several hamlets and districts that are, from north to south:\n* '''Cardo''': a village northeast of the city, Cardo was one of the first inhabited places in the area.\n* '''Le Fango''': an area which has developed recently on the mountainside. It includes in particular the prefecture of Haute-Corse, Bastia railway station, and the ''Lyc\u00e9e Giocante de Casabianca''.\n* '''Gradiccia'''\n* '''Saint Antoine'''\n* '''Fort Lacroix'''\n* '''La Citadelle'''\n* '''Saint Joseph'''\n* '''Monserato'''\n* '''Lupino''': a district south of the city, the first to be developed mainly with social housing.\n* '''Paese Novo''': a residential district overlooking ''Montesoro'' on the old \"Imperial road\" that bypasses the town via the heights. Bastia Hospital is located in this district.\n* '''Montesoro''': another residential district south of Bastia. It has large groups of new buildings with many shops. Montesoro also has large schools: technical and vocational schools, and a secondary education college.\n* '''Erbajolo''': another district at the southern end of town. It marks the beginning of the industrial zone south of Bastia agglomeration. It has the largest commercial area in the city (Hyper U) and a football stadium.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Bastia vieux port.JPG|thumb|The entry to the old port with the commercial port behind]]\n\nThe bastiaise agglomeration comntains most of the few industries that exist in Corsica. Bastia is the seat of the ''Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Bastia and Upper Corsica''.\n\nIn the Bastia region the Chamber of Commerce and Industry manages the following facilities:\n* '''Bastia Commercial Port''': the port can accommodate eight large vessels (6 passenger ships and two others) simultaneously as well as pilot boats and tugs. It is the second largest port in France in terms of passenger traffic after [[Calais]]\n* '''[[Bastia \u2013 Poretta Airport]]''' is located south of Bastia agglomeration in the communes of Borgo and [[Lucciana]].\n\n==Culture and heritage==\n[[File:Bastia ville 01.jpg|thumb|View from the Old Port]]\n[[File:Piazza San Nicola Bastia.jpg|thumb|The Place Saint-Nicolas.]]\n[[File:Palazzo governatori Bastia.JPG|thumb|The Palace of Governors.]]\n\n===Civil heritage===\nThe commune has a large number of buildings and sites that are registered as historical monuments:\n* The '''Romieu Public Garden''' (1874){{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e Icon}}<ref>Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e {{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|IA2B001277|IA2B001277 Romieu Public Garden}} {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n* The '''Joan of Arc Garden'''{{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e Icon}}<ref>Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e {{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|IA2B001271|IA2B001271 Joan of Arc Garden}} {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n* The '''Law Courts''' (1856) {{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e Icon}}<ref>Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e {{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|PA00099163|PA00099163 Law Courts}} {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n* The '''Old Town Hall Garden''' (19th century){{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e Icon}}<ref>Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e {{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|IA2B001266|IA2B001266 Old Town Hall Garden}} {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n* The '''Villayet Saint-Dominique Garden''' (19th century){{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e Icon}}<ref>Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e {{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|IA2B001284|IA2B001284 Villayet Saint-Dominique Garden}} {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n* The '''Saint-Antoine Convent Garden''' (19th century){{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e Icon}}<ref>Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e {{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|IA2B001270|IA2B001270 Villayet Saint-Antoine Convent Garden}} {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n* The '''Napolean Monument''' (1813){{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e Icon}}<ref>Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e {{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|IA2B001772|IA2B001772 }}{{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|PA2B000012|PA2B000012 Napolean Monument}} {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n* The '''Donati Pleasure Garden'''{{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e Icon}}<ref>Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e {{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|IA2B001272|IA2B001272 Donati Pleasure Garden}} {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n* The '''Providence Garden''' (19th century){{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e Icon}}<ref>Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e {{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|IA2B001276|IA2B001276 Providence Garden}} {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n* The '''Flach Garden''' (19th century){{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e Icon}}<ref>Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e {{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|IA2B001274|IA2B001274 Flach Garden}} {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n* The '''Bon Pasteur Courtyard Garden'''{{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e Icon}}<ref>Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e {{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|IA2B001269|IA2B001269 Bon Pasteur Courtyard Garden}} {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n* The '''Villa Fumarolli Pleasure Garden''' (19th century){{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e Icon}}<ref>Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e {{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|IA2B001275|IA2B001275 Villa Fumarolli Pleasure Garden}} {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n* The '''Sainte-Victoire Public Garden'''{{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e Icon}}<ref>Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e {{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|IA2B001273|IA2B001273 Sainte-Victoire Public Garden}} {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n* The '''Maison Castagnola''' (17th century){{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e Icon}}<ref>Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e {{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|PA00125389|PA00125389 Maison Castagnola}} {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n* The '''Maison de Caraffa''' (17th century){{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e Icon}}<ref>Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e {{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|PA2B000017|PA2B000017 Maison de Caraffa}} {{Camera}} {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n* The '''Governor's Citadel and Palace''' (14th century){{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e Icon}}<ref>Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e {{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|PA00099158|PA0099158 Governor's Citadel and Palace}} {{Camera}} {{in lang|fr}}</ref> The former palace of the Genoese governors houses the municipal  museum, formerly the Ethnology Museum of Corsica.<ref>[http://www.musee-bastia.com/ Bastia Museum website] {{in lang|fr}}</ref> Abutting the old fortress tower and decorated with a 14th-century [[campanile]], the Palace of Governors over the centuries guarded Terra Nova and beyond the ramparts of the Old Port.

The turret of the submarine Casabianca was preserved in the courtyard until the renovations.\n* The '''Mattei Terraces'''{{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e Icon}}<ref>Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e {{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|IA2B001286|IA2B001286 Mattei Terraces}} {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n* The '''Villa Lota Garden''' (20th century){{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e Icon}}<ref>Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e {{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|IA2B001285|IA2B001285 Villa Lota Garden}} {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n* The '''Cardo Cemetery Garden''' (20th century){{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e Icon}}<ref>Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e {{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|IA2B001283|IA2B001283 Cardo Cemetery Garden}} {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n* The '''German Cemetery Garden''' (20th century){{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e Icon}}<ref>Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e {{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|IA2B001268|IA2B001268 German Cemetery Garden}} {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n* The '''Bosquet Pecunia Green Area'''{{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e Icon}}<ref>Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e {{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|IA2B001267|IA2B001267 Bosquet Pecunia Green Area}} {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n* A '''Foundry''' (1870){{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e Icon}}<ref>Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e {{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|IA2B000560|IA2B000560 Foundry}} {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n* The '''Cardo Copper Mine''' (1868){{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e Icon}}<ref>Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e {{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|IA2B000372|IA2B000372 Cardo Copper Mine}} {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n* The '''Toga Iron Works''' (1842){{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e Icon}}<ref>Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e {{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|IA2B000941|IA2B000941 Toga Iron Works}} {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\n===Religious heritage===\nThe commune has many religious buildings and sites that are registered as historical monuments:\n* The '''Old Church at Cardo''' (13th century){{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e Icon}}<ref>Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e {{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|PA00099179|PA00099179 Old Church at Cardo}} {{Camera}} {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n* The '''Church of Saint Charles''' (1612){{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e Icon}}<ref>Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e {{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|PA2B000006|PA2B000006 Church of Saint Charles}} {{Camera}} {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n* The '''Church or Oratory of Saint Roch''' (1604){{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e Icon}}<ref>Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e {{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|PA2B000007|PA2B000007 Church or Oratory of Saint Roch}} {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n* The '''Parish Centre of Notre-Dame des Victoires''' (20th century){{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e Icon}}<ref>Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e {{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|PA2B000013|PA2B000013 Parish Centre of Notre-Dame des Victoires}} {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n* The '''Church of Notre-Dame de Montserato''' (18th century){{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e Icon}}<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e {{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|PA00135318|PA00135318 Church of Notre-Dame de Montserato}} {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n* The '''Church of Saint-\u00c9tienne de Cardo''' (1838){{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e Icon}}<ref>Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e {{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|PA00125388|PA00125388 Church of Saint-\u00c9tienne de Cardo}} {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n* The '''[[Bastia Cathedral|Church of Sainte-Marie]]''' (17th century){{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e Icon}}<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> a former Cathedral built in 1495 but heavily remodeled in the early 17th century, is located in the heart of the citadel.\n* The '''[[\u00c9glise Sainte-Croix de Bastia|Church of Saint-Croix]]''' (18th century){{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e Icon}}<ref>Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e {{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|PA00099161|PA00099161 Church of Saint-Croix}} {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n* The '''[[\u00c9glise Saint-Jean-Baptiste de Bastia|Church of Saint John the Baptist]]''' (1636){{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e Icon}},<ref>Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e {{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|PA00099160|PA00099160 Church of Saint John the Baptist}} {{Camera}} {{in lang|fr}}</ref> one of the most emblematic monuments of the city of Bastia.

Approximately 10% of the population are immigrants. The unemployment rate in the commune has persistently been one of the highest in France, standing at over 20% in 2004.\n\nThe inhabitants of the commune are known as ''Bastiais'' or ''Bastiaises''.<ref>[http://www.habitants.fr/haute-corse-2B Inhabitants of Haute-Corse] {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\nThe commune has been awarded '''three flowers''' by the ''National Council of Towns and Villages in Bloom'' in the ''Competition of cities and villages in Bloom''.<ref>[http://www.cnvvf.fr/les_villes_et_village_fleuris-47.html Competition for Towns and Villages in Bloom website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210053901/http://www.cnvvf.fr/les_villes_et_village_fleuris-47.html |date=10 December 2014 }} {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\nLocated in the North-East of [[Corsica]] at the base of the [[Cap Corse]], between the [[sea]] and the mountain, Bastia is the principal [[port]] of the island. The city is located {{convert|35|km|0|abbr=on}} away from the northern tip of the Cap Corse, {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} west from [[Elba]], an Italian island, and {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=on}} away from continental [[Italy]] which can be seen a few days per year when visibility is excellent.\n\n[[File:Bastia Serra di Pigno.jpg|thumb|alt=Bastia seen from the \"Pigno\"|left|The city of Bastia as seen from the \"Pigno\": notice the lack of constructions in the foreground and the city along the coast in the background]]\n\nIn terms of geography, Bastia is defined by its position between the sea and the mountain. The city is located on the Eastern side of the \"Serra di Pignu\", a {{convert|960|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} mountain (see photo opposite). This steep mountain and several hills in the city shape a relief typical of the [[Cap Corse]]. This pronounced landscape caused the city to develop mostly on a coastal band about {{convert|1.5|km|0|abbr=on}} wide, which is a very limited part of the {{convert|19.38|km\u00b2|2|abbr=on}} that the [[commune]] has.\n\nAbove all, Bastia is a [[port]], and the [[sea]] has of course a significant role in the spatial organization of the city. Bastia possesses nowadays three different [[port]]s. The old port (\"Vieux Port\" in [[French language|French]] and \"Portu Vechju\" in [[Corsican language|Corsican]]), located in a remarkable and narrow cove, offers good natural shelter against the climatic hazards of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Thus, it was at the core of the initial development of the city. Nowadays, many pleasure and fishing boats are still there, but it is not as economically vital than the other more modern ports, although its touristic and aesthetic charm almost makes the old port the official emblem of the city. In fact, many caf\u00e9s, bars and restaurants have moved to its docks to which access is granted by the city for pedestrians only during summer evenings.\n\nA bit more to the North is located the commercial and ferry port. As a major economic asset of the city, the \"port de commerce\" is the pulse of the city. It is even more so during the summer when ferry arrivals and departures of thousands of passengers and cars can sometimes cause long traffic jams along the north\u2013south axis, the national road RN193. In front of the commercial port, the large Saint-Nicolas square represents the heart of the city. Just North of the commercial port, the Toga [[marina]], named after a city neighborhood, is a harbor for leisure boating activities like sailing and yachting. There are also some bars, restaurants and night clubs on its docks.\n\nThus, Bastia is logically organized on a relatively narrow north\u2013south axis which can make access to the city centre difficult under particular circumstances. Nowadays, the city centre is mainly composed of the \"citadelle\", the stronghold, also called Terra-Nova, with the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] Governors' Palace, the old port and its popular quarter and the market plaza, and finally the ensemble of buildings along the \"Boulevard Paoli\", the main commercial street of the city, which lies from the Justice Court to the Avenue Mar\u00e9chal Sebastiani.\n\nDuring the last few decades, Bastia and its region have experienced a strong demographic growth, which has cause somewhat of a suburban crawl in the South of the city, because of the congestion of the city center.\n\n{{Geographic location\n|title='''Neighbouring communes and villages'''<ref name=Google/><ref name=Geo/>\n|Centre    = Bastia \n|North     = [[Ville-di-Pietrabugno]]\n|Northeast = [[Tyrrhenian Sea]]\n|East      = Tyrrhenian Sea\n|Southeast = Tyrrhenian Sea\n|South     = [[Furiani]]\n|Southwest = [[Barbaggio]]\n|West      = [[Patrimonio]]\n|Northwest = [[Farinole]]\n}}\n\n===Geology and relief===\nThe commune is located in the Alpine Eastern Corsica region <ref group=\"Note\">This region consists of a range of terrain resulting from a vanished ocean called ''Liguro-Piedmont'' (in the [[Tethys ocean]] whose age is between 170 to 60 Million years old) and its continental margins. The age of the Alpine Corsica region ranges from [[Triassic]] to recent.</ref> which is formed from \"a succession of [[Autochthon (geology)|Autochthons]] (fixed terrain), para-Autochtons (weakly displaced terrain) and especially [[Allochthon]]s (highly displaced terrain). The first two coincide roughly with the central depression. The Allochtons are mainly in the area of lustrous [[schist]]s and [[ophiolite]]s corresponding to the eastern relief ([[Cap Corse]] and Castagniccia)\".<ref>[http://cgo.asso.free.fr/telechargement/LaCorse2010.doc ''Corsica \u2013 Simplified Geological Map of Corsica''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304034551/http://cgo.asso.free.fr/telechargement/LaCorse2010.doc |date=4 March 2016 }}, Geology Centre of Oisans p. 6 {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\nIts base rests on a granite bedrock ([[Felsic]] granites from the [[Hercynian]], plain rocks), which has been covered with oceanic layers of:\n\n* Sedimentary rocks ([[Miocene]] to [[Quaternary]]) on the east coast, ranging from the mouth of the ''Ruisseau de Lupino'' north to the south bank of the mouth of the Travo\n* lustrous [[schist]]s along the entire eastern side of Cap Corse,\n* ophiolite deposited in eastern Corsica during the [[Eocene]] period.\n\nNote the presence of [[copper]] ore in Cardo which was once the subject of a concession.\n\nGeographically, Bastia is characterized by its location between the sea and the mountains. The commune lies on the eastern flank of the \"Serra di Pignu\" a mountain which rises to 960 m above sea level. This steep mountain with other hills around Bastia forms the typical terrain of Cap Corse. This pronounced relief largely explains the development of the city on a coastal strip of about 1.5&nbsp;km in width which is a very limited proportion of the 19.38 km2 of the whole commune.\n\n===Hydrography===\nThe river network is sparse. There are three small streams (or ''fiumes'') flowing from west to east:\n\n* in the north the Ruisseau Fiuminale rises in the north-west of the commune 400 m north-east of Monte Muzzone (920 m).<ref>{{Sandre|Y7320540|Ruisseau Fiuminale|consulted on 5 July 2015}} {{in lang|fr}}</ref> Along its length of 4.3 kilometres it forms the border between the communes of Bastia and [[Ville-di-Pietrabugno]] from its source to the roundabout of the Annunciation.

A portion of about 23&nbsp;km is 2X2 lanes between Arena and [[Vescovato, Haute-Corse|Vescovato]] since the inauguration of the \"expressway Borgo-Vescovato\" in January 2013. This is the major road axis into the Bastia region because it connects the city of Bastia directly or indirectly to all other Corsican towns (Ajaccio, [[Corte, Haute-Corse|Corte]], [[Porto-Vecchio]], [[Calvi, Haute-Corse|Calvi]] etc.) while also passing through the main cities of the peripheral region of Bastia such as [[Furiani]], [[Biguglia]], [[Borgo, Haute-Corse|Borgo]], and [[Lucciana]] where [[Bastia Poretta Airport]] is located. This road is also called the ''Waterfront Route'' from the Montesoro district because it runs along the seafront up to the Old Port Tunnel which runs under the citadel and the Old Port. This road ultimately ends at Ajaccio.\n* from the West:, by the D81, a road which goes to [[Saint-Florent, Haute-Corse|Saint-Florent]] via the Col de Teghime.\n* from the North: by the D80, which goes in a loop around Cap Corse (the road between Bastia and Pietranera was opened in 1829).\n\nThe road distance to other towns and cities in Corsica is:\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* 10&nbsp;km to [[Santa-Maria-di-Lota]]\n* 12&nbsp;km to [[Brando, Haute-Corse|Brando]]\n* 18&nbsp;km to [[Patrimonio]]\n* 19&nbsp;km to [[Borgo, Haute-Corse|Borgo]]\n* 20&nbsp;km to [[Oletta]]\n* 23&nbsp;km to [[Murato, Haute-Corse|Murato]]\n* 24&nbsp;km to [[Saint-Florent, Haute-Corse|Saint-Florent]]\n* 26&nbsp;km to [[Vescovato, Haute-Corse|Vescovato]]\n* 29&nbsp;km to [[Luri, Haute-Corse|Luri]]\n* 33&nbsp;km to [[Nonza]]\n* 34&nbsp;km to [[Volpajola]]\n* 36&nbsp;km to [[Macinaggio]]\n* 40&nbsp;km to [[Rogliano, Haute-Corse|Rogliano]]\n* 46&nbsp;km to [[Canari]]\n* 47&nbsp;km to [[Ponte-Leccia]]\n* 48&nbsp;km to [[Centuri, Haute-Corse|Centuri]]\n* 49&nbsp;km to [[Cervione]]\n* 68&nbsp;km to [[Corte, Haute-Corse|Corte]]\n* 68&nbsp;km to [[L'\u00cele-Rousse]]\n* 73&nbsp;km to [[Al\u00e9ria]]\n* 92&nbsp;km to [[Calvi, Haute-Corse|Calvi]]\n* 129&nbsp;km to [[Vico, Corse-du-Sud|Vico]]\n* 143&nbsp;km to [[Porto-Vecchio]]\n* 145&nbsp;km to [[Zicavo]]\n* 147&nbsp;km to [[Ajaccio]]\n* 171&nbsp;km to [[Bonifacio, Corse-du-Sud|Bonifacio]]\n* 179&nbsp;km to [[Sart\u00e8ne]]\n* 181&nbsp;km to [[Propriano]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Bus transport===\nThe urban area of Bastia is served by a bus network with 14 routes operated by the Autobus Bastiais company.<ref>[http://www.bastiabus.com/ ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Autobus Bastiais''] Official website {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\n===Rail transport===\nThe Bastia railway station belongs to [[Chemins de Fer de la Corse]] and is located in the city centre.

This territory was occupied by the Vanacimi people.<ref>[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b5963841x.r=Italia+antica+Tolomeo.langFR Map ''Italia antica Cl.

Shortly afterwards, considering the great expense and little profit in Corsica, the Republic decided to withdraw and no longer intervene in the affairs of the island. Nevertheless some Genoese gentlemen formed a partnership known as the [[Maona]] to try and manage the economy on the island on behalf of the Republic of Genoa. The five partners were: Leonello Lomellino, Giovanni da Balagnera, Aluigi Tortorino, Andreolo Ficone, and Cristoforo Maruffo. They all came with the title of Governor and brought with them a thousand soldiers.<ref name=\"Grossa\">Giovanni della Grossa in ''Croniche'', translation by Lucien Auguste Letteron: ''History of Corsica \u2013 Vol. 1'' {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\nAfter an expedition to Cinarca followed by a short period of peace, Leonello Lomellino returned as governor and to gain an advantage over the Count [[Arrigo della Rocca]] with whom he would have to fight, he began by fortifying [[Al\u00e9ria]]. \" Then Count Arrigo and his allies once again crossed the mountains and made incursions against Cap Corse: having met no resistance, they went to besiege Al\u00e9ria which capitulated after four months. Leonello, deprived of all support, returned to [[Biguglia]] and from there he went to build the castle of Bastia to maintain his sea communications\".<ref name=\"Grossa\"/> <ref group=\"Note\">In a footnote (p. 233) to ''History of Corsica'' \u2013 Vol. I, Abbot Letteron wrote: \"The foundation of Bastia is generally fixed on the year 1378 but ''The Bastia'' was not built until a few years later as there were several wars between that event and the institution of the Maona\" {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\n\"Between the second half of the 12th century and the middle of the 13th century the feudal system was in place at all levels of society and new links were created between the elite of the aristocracy and the Maritime Republics, between representatives of the island's nobility, and between them and the poor. At the same time castles multiplied. They were then owned by fifteen noble families of local or peninsular origin, sometimes fragmented into independent lordships or even [sic] rivals: {{ill|Bagnaia family|lt=Bagnaia|fr|Famille De Bagnaia}}, Amondaschi, Cortinchi, Pinaschi de Coasini, Lotreto de Nebbio, Loreto de Casinca, Orezza, Avogari, Camilla, Turca, Pevere, de Mari (from the mid-13th century only), and the ''Marquis de Massa and Corsica''\".\n\n\u2013  Daniel Istria \u2013 Powers and fortifications in northern Corsica 11th \u2013 14th Century p.&nbsp;145\n\nAccording to Giovanni della Grossa, the \"seigneurialisation\" of Loreto would have beene, as with Genoese families of the Cape, usurping the County title acquired during the \"people's government\". Small lordships that emerged from the courts of the Bishop of Nebbio, probably sometime in the second half of the 12th century or the beginning of the 13th century, were partly absorbed by the lords of Bagnaia before 1247. Then, before 1289, they were recovered and absorbed, like many others in the new lordship of Giovanninello de Loreto. Taking advantage of the Genoese-pisano rivalries, he extended his possessions to the east and west.\n\nWritten documentation illustrates the business of territorial conquest conducted by Giovanninello during the years 1260\u20131280. After raiding the castles of Nebbio and Pureto in the Ostriconi, he went on to the conquest of the pieve of [[Orto]], which was then under the control of Bagnaia, and he built two new fortifications: Montebello and Petra di Bugno. These were intended not only to dominate and control the northern part of Bagnaia, whose Cerlino Lake had a certain economic interest, but probably also to neutralise Porto Cardo, which occupied a strategic military position as well as having businesses. It was here that the fortress of Bastia was erected, the residence of the Genoese governors from the 15th century. The agreements between Giovanninello and the commune of Genoa in 1289 demonstrated the importance of this baronial control of land routes and anchorages, a major source of revenue and a guarantee of the security of the territory.<ref>Daniel Istria \u2013 ''Powers and Fortifications in the north of Corsica 11th\u201314th century'' p. 122 {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\n===Originally Cardo===\n[[File:Bastia maison-tour la Vetrice Cardo.jpg|thumb|La Vetrice Tower]]\n\nBefore the occupation of Corsica by the Genoese there were several communities of the pieve of [[Orto]]: Soverta, La Vetrice, Belgodere, Astima, and Le Corbaia. All these villages have today almost disappeared. On the coast there was a small hamlet inhabited by fishermen called Porto Cardo which means \"Cardo Port\".\n\n===Modern times===\n[[File:CitadelleBastia.jpg|thumb|The citadel, built by the Genoese]]\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries the [[Franciscans]] settled in the Pieve of Orto.\n\nAt the beginning of the 16th century, Monseigneur Agostino [[Giustiniani]], Bishop of Nebbio, described in his ''Dialogo nominato  Corsica'':\n\n\"[...] The pieve of [[Orto]] is almost ruined; it contains 340 [[feu fiscal|fires]]. In this pi\u00e8ve is Biguglia with a convent of [[Friars Minor]] [...]. With Biguglia there are still these pi\u00e8ves: Furiani, Belgodere, Soverta, La Vetrice, and Corbaia; nowadays, all these villages have almost disappeared.\"\n\n\u2013  Agostino Giustiniani in ''Description of Corsica'', translation by Lucien Auguste Letteron in ''History of Corsica'', Bulletin of the Society for Historical and Natural Sciences of Corsica \u2013 Volume I \u2013 1888, p.&nbsp;50. {{in lang|fr}}\n\nContinuing, he writes:\n\n\"It is in this pi\u00e8ve Bastia lies, home to the Bishop and Governor of Corsica. Before the last war this city had 700 houses divided into two districts: Terranova and Terravecchia. There was formerly in this place a castle or tower, or rather a fortress of the kind called on the continent ''Bastie'' [...]. Terravecchia was an open area which is now burned and ruined largely as a result of the war. The land is very steep on the lower slopes and walking is very painful; on the other hand the Terranova area is generally flat, with fairly wide streets and many modern houses. It is surrounded not only by a solid wall, which forms a continuous enclosure, but a wide and deep moat and magnificent bastions. The wall was begun in the time of Tomasino de Campofregoso, then lord of the island, and completed later through the efforts of the [[Bank of Saint George]]. The bastions and the moat were made by that same bank and by the Genoese government during the last war. The bank has added a very beautiful citadel but the benefits do not match the expense it required during its construction; it cost, in fact, 25,000 [[ducat]]s. Bastia has two convents of [[Friars Minor]], one of [[Recollects]], and the other [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]]. This city, being the governor's residence, prospered greatly but it also had much to suffer in recent wars. Although the main centre on the island many people were of the opinion that its importance will hardly increase. The first reason they give is that the population of the city is composed of Genoese and Corsicans: the Genoese, from Rivi\u00e8res, belong to the lower class. Most Corsicans also belonged in this class. There is a jealousy and rivalry between the inhabitants of Bastia so great that few mind the interests of the city: they apply themselves only to deceit and to oust each other and that is where we get all the evil. The second reason is that the city has no port. It has in fact a small bay where it is possible to relax on small boats. On the other hand, houses, until now, have been very poorly distributed. There is not one that has a stable nor even a well or a cistern, so that it is necessary to fetch water from the fountain outside. Also in summer the water is very hot because it comes from far away via an [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]].\n\nThe cellars are far from being good. Bastia is built on a rocky ground, where ducts and sewers can be dug only with great difficulty. The city has no pleasant walks and is also very exposed to the West Wind which sometimes lasts for eight or ten days, so we can not leave home because the wind is so strong that it shakes the houses. What is more advantageous for Bastia is to be near fertile country that produces some wine, such as at Cap Corse, and elsewhere wheat, as on the higher pi\u00e8ves. There is a at the doorstep and only a short distance from Piombino and other mainland locations. It is for these reasons, and not for others, that the Board has chosen Bastia to make the residence of its governors: because there is nowhere on the island where the governor would be better off than at Bastia\".\n\n\u2013  Agostino Giustiniani in ''Description of Corsica'', translation by Lucien Auguste Letteron in ''History of Corsica''. {{in lang|fr}}\n\nHe ends his description as follows:\n\n\"There were still in the pi\u00e8ve of Orto two small villages with the main pieve church dedicated to Saint Mary. These two villages and the church were ruined after the last [[Bubonis plague|plague]] and also because of the negligence of the pi\u00e9vans. After Porraggia comes Punta d'Arco and the Chiurlino Lake, about ten miles long, which can be entered only by very small boats. In this lake is an island, where there is good hunting for [[wild boar]]. This place is called the island. There are also two other small islands where fishermen stay: one is called ''Ischia nova'' which became famous in the recent wars and the other is called ''Ischia Vacchia''. There is fishing in this lake for ''cephalic'' (cefalu or mazzardi), [[Mullet (fish)|mullet]] (muggini), and other fish that make excellent [[Botargo]]. These fish and eels are taken in large quantities and serve as ordinary food for the inhabitants of Bastia, not to mention the fish that comes from the pi\u00e8ves of Orto, Mariana and Mercurio. Then comes the Port of Lo Pino then the Gulf of Bastia, which is called ''Portocardo'' by the sailors. There is then the Ruisseau de S. Nicolas, then successively the Port of Toga, Grigione, the port and Ruisseau di Pietranera where there is a tower.\"\n\n\u2013  Agostino Giustiniani in ''Description of Corsica'', translation by Lucien Auguste Letteron in ''History of Corsica''. {{in lang|fr}}\n\n===The Genoese era===\nThe Genoese soon felt the need to protect Bastia from invasions coming from the sea and began to build a bastiglia (moat) and a citadel in the time of governor Leonello Lomellini.\n\nOver time, the ''Bastiglia'' (Bastia) has grown, become prosperous, and become more important than Cardo.\n\nIts history is in its \"bastiglia\" or citadel which was originally a walled city. Here it was the sea and the mountains that determined the location of habitations as well as the relief of the island. Bastia was the capital at the time of the Genoese domination. It spread to the slopes later, drawn toward the water in the ''Place Saint-Nicolas''.\n\nCreated by the Genoese patrician Leonello Lomellini in 1353 to liaise with Genoa, the city originated on the roack where a tower was built ( a ''bastiglia'', hence its name) and, a hundred years later, was surrounded by walls.\n\nAt the beginning of the 18th century, many improvements were made in the Punta district, where many shops were built. Bastia and the whole island came under French military domination on 8 May 1769.\n\nIn 1794, during a war with [[Revolutionary France]], British troops under [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Admiral Nelson]] and Lieutenant-General [[David Dundas (British Army officer)|David Dundas]] briefly [[Siege of Bastia|captured Bastia]].\n\nIn 1848 Bastia took 44 hectares from [[Ville-di-Pietrabugno]].\n\n===Contemporary period===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\n{{see also|Italian occupation of Corsica}}\nBastia suffered much damage during the [[Second World War]]. Nevertheless Corsica was the first department to be liberated on 4 October 1943 by the Corsican resistance in the ''Pearl Harbor secret mission'' (sent by the secret services of the military defence establishment in [[Algiers]]) and the submarine ''[[French submarine Casabianca (1935)|Casabianca]]''.\n\nThe commandos of the secret mission (Roger de Saule, Laurent Preziosi, the cousins Toussaint, and Pierre Griffi) landed in the night of 13 to 14 December 1942 from the submarine Casabianca in the Bay of Topiti. After organizing a network in this region (Piana), they then moved to organize a 2nd network at Corte led locally by Pascal Valentini, finally heading for Bastia to organise a 3rd network in the Bastia and Cap Corse region. It was around Hyacinthe de Montera, specifically at 35 Bouvelard Paoli, that the movement was organized. Laurent Preziosi had already participated in the first meetings in 1941 before returning to Algiers to be recruited for the mission. The movement then organized within the [[National Front (French Resistance)|National Front]]. The radioman, Pierre Griffi was arrested in Ajaccio, severely tortured, and shot in Bastia without talking on 18 August 1943.\n\nThe turret of the submarine ''Casabianca'' is displayed at the corner of the ''Place Saint-Nicolas'' on the sea side. A commemorative stone of the first meeting was affixed to 35 boulevard Paoli (above the door).\n\nAfter the war, Bastia gradually emerged as a key economic centre of Corsica. The Bastia agglomeration is the most extensive on the island.\n\nDuring the last fifty years Cardo had the second homes of wealthy Bastiais. Currently Cardo is a district of Bastia on the heights of Pigno. It attracts many people who want to live there as it has all the advantages of a village in the countryside while being close to the city.\n\n===Heraldry===\n{{Blazon-arms\n|img1=Blason Ville fr Bastia.svg\n|legend1=Arms of Bastia \n|text=\n\n'''Blazon:'''<br/>\n''Azure, a fortress Argent, turreted, masoned, windows, and port of Sable on a terrace in base Vert.''\n}}\n\n==Administration==\n'''List of Successive [[Mayor (France)|Mayors]]'''<ref>[http://www.francegenweb.org/mairesgenweb/resultcommune.php?id=7677 List of Mayors of France] {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\n{{Hidden begin\n|title=[[Mayor (France)|Mayors]] from 1770 to 1941\n|titlestyle = background:palegreen;\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In 2015 SC Bastia played and lost the final of the League Cup against PSG, 20 years after playing them in the same competition in 1995. The club currently plays in [[Ligue 1]].<ref>[http://www.sc-bastia.corsica/?page_id=22 SAC Bastia website] {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\nBesides SC Bastia there are two other amateur football clubs: [[CA Bastia]] who currently play in the [[Championnat National]] and [[\u00c9F Bastia]]. A fourth club, the ''Football Corsica Club Bastiais'' (FCCB) disappeared after playing in six amateur championships in Corsica in the 1950s Historically each of these four clubs was supported by a different part of the city: the Place Saint-Nicolas district were blue (SC Bastia), the Old Port was black (CA Bastia), the citadel and the Saint Joseph district were white (EF Bastia), and the market area was red (FCCB). Sporting dominance has overshadowed other clubs in Bastia over time. At the end of the 2012/2013 season there were for the first time two professional clubs in Bastia: SC Bastia in Ligue 1 and the CA Bastia promoted from National, for a total of four Corsican professional football clubs (with [[AC Ajaccio]] in Ligue 1 and [[GFC Ajaccio]], relegated to National but retaining its professional status).\n\nBastia was also a city-stage in the [[Tour de France 2013]]: the arrival point  of the first stage from [[Porto-Vecchio]] and starting point for the second to [[Ajaccio]].\n\nBastia is currently the headquarters for the French round of the [[FIA World Rally Championship]].\n\n==Town planning==\n[[File:Citadelle Bastia.jpg|thumb|View from the Citadel]]\n[[File:VP-Bastia.jpg|thumb|Coloured fa\u00e7ades in the Old Port]]\n\nBastia is primarily a port city so the sea has a predominant place in the spatial organization of the city. Nowadays Bastia has three different ports.\n\n* The '''Old Port:''' located in a narrow cove that offers good protection against the Mediterranean weather. It was therefore at the heart of the initial development of the city. Today it still is home to many yachts and fishing boats but it is not so economically vital for the city than the other modern ports, although its tourism and aesthetic appeal makes it an almost official emblem of Bastia. Many bar-cafes and restaurants have opened on its quays whose streets are pedestrian access only in the summer.\n* The '''Commercial Port''': a little north of the Old Port, it is the major economic asset of the city. This is especially true in the summer period when thousands of arrivals and departures of passengers and vehicles can sometimes cause long traffic jams along [[Route nationale]] N193 despite the existence of a tunnel under the Old Port. Opposite the commercial port is the vast ''Place Saint Nicolas'' which is the heart of the city.\n* The '''Toga Marina''': north of the commercial port partly in [[Ville-di-Pietrabugno]] is occupied by many sailboats and yachts. There are also several bars, restaurants and nightclubs on its quays.\n\n===The city centre and outlying urban areas===\nToday the city centre consists mainly of the citadel (also called ''Terra Nova''), the Palace of the Governors, the Old Port with its surrounding neighbourhood and the market place, and finally all the buildings along the Paoli Boulevard \u2013 the main commercial street of the city which stretches from the courthouse to the Avenue Mar\u00e9chal Sebastiani.\n\nIn recent decades Bastia and its region have had strong demographic growth which has now grown beyond the municipal boundaries.\n[[File:Cardu.JPG|thumb|The Village of Cardo]]\nBastia has several hamlets and districts that are, from north to south:\n* '''Cardo''': a village northeast of the city, Cardo was one of the first inhabited places in the area.\n* '''Le Fango''': an area which has developed recently on the mountainside. It includes in particular the prefecture of Haute-Corse, Bastia railway station, and the ''Lyc\u00e9e Giocante de Casabianca''.\n* '''Gradiccia'''\n* '''Saint Antoine'''\n* '''Fort Lacroix'''\n* '''La Citadelle'''\n* '''Saint Joseph'''\n* '''Monserato'''\n* '''Lupino''': a district south of the city, the first to be developed mainly with social housing.\n* '''Paese Novo''': a residential district overlooking ''Montesoro'' on the old \"Imperial road\" that bypasses the town via the heights. Bastia Hospital is located in this district.\n* '''Montesoro''': another residential district south of Bastia. It has large groups of new buildings with many shops. Montesoro also has large schools: technical and vocational schools, and a secondary education college.\n* '''Erbajolo''': another district at the southern end of town. It marks the beginning of the industrial zone south of Bastia agglomeration. It has the largest commercial area in the city (Hyper U) and a football stadium.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Bastia vieux port.JPG|thumb|The entry to the old port with the commercial port behind]]\n\nThe bastiaise agglomeration comntains most of the few industries that exist in Corsica. Bastia is the seat of the ''Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Bastia and Upper Corsica''.\n\nIn the Bastia region the Chamber of Commerce and Industry manages the following facilities:\n* '''Bastia Commercial Port''': the port can accommodate eight large vessels (6 passenger ships and two others) simultaneously as well as pilot boats and tugs. It is the second largest port in France in terms of passenger traffic after [[Calais]]\n* '''[[Bastia \u2013 Poretta Airport]]''' is located south of Bastia agglomeration in the communes of Borgo and [[Lucciana]].\n\n==Culture and heritage==\n[[File:Bastia ville 01.jpg|thumb|View from the Old Port]]\n[[File:Piazza San Nicola Bastia.jpg|thumb|The Place Saint-Nicolas.]]\n[[File:Palazzo governatori Bastia.JPG|thumb|The Palace of Governors.]]\n\n===Civil heritage===\nThe commune has a large number of buildings and sites that are registered as historical monuments:\n* The '''Romieu Public Garden''' (1874){{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e Icon}}<ref>Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e {{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|IA2B001277|IA2B001277 Romieu Public Garden}} {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n* The '''Joan of Arc Garden'''{{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e Icon}}<ref>Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e {{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|IA2B001271|IA2B001271 Joan of Arc Garden}} {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n* The '''Law Courts''' (1856) {{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e Icon}}<ref>Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e {{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|PA00099163|PA00099163 Law Courts}} {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n* The '''Old Town Hall Garden''' (19th century){{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e Icon}}<ref>Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e {{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|IA2B001266|IA2B001266 Old Town Hall Garden}} {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n* The '''Villayet Saint-Dominique Garden''' (19th century){{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e Icon}}<ref>Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e {{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|IA2B001284|IA2B001284 Villayet Saint-Dominique Garden}} {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n* The '''Saint-Antoine Convent Garden''' (19th century){{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e Icon}}<ref>Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e {{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|IA2B001270|IA2B001270 Villayet Saint-Antoine Convent Garden}} {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n* The '''Napolean Monument''' (1813){{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e Icon}}<ref>Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e {{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|IA2B001772|IA2B001772 }}{{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|PA2B000012|PA2B000012 Napolean Monument}} {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n* The '''Donati Pleasure Garden'''{{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e Icon}}<ref>Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e {{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|IA2B001272|IA2B001272 Donati Pleasure Garden}} {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n* The '''Providence Garden''' (19th century){{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e Icon}}<ref>Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e {{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|IA2B001276|IA2B001276 Providence Garden}} {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n* The '''Flach Garden''' (19th century){{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e Icon}}<ref>Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e {{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|IA2B001274|IA2B001274 Flach Garden}} {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n* The '''Bon Pasteur Courtyard Garden'''{{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e Icon}}<ref>Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e {{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|IA2B001269|IA2B001269 Bon Pasteur Courtyard Garden}} {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n* The '''Villa Fumarolli Pleasure Garden''' (19th century){{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e Icon}}<ref>Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e {{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|IA2B001275|IA2B001275 Villa Fumarolli Pleasure Garden}} {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n* The '''Sainte-Victoire Public Garden'''{{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e Icon}}<ref>Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e {{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|IA2B001273|IA2B001273 Sainte-Victoire Public Garden}} {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n* The '''Maison Castagnola''' (17th century){{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e Icon}}<ref>Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e {{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|PA00125389|PA00125389 Maison Castagnola}} {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n* The '''Maison de Caraffa''' (17th century){{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e Icon}}<ref>Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e {{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|PA2B000017|PA2B000017 Maison de Caraffa}} {{Camera}} {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n* The '''Governor's Citadel and Palace''' (14th century){{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e Icon}}<ref>Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e {{M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|PA00099158|PA0099158 Governor's Citadel and Palace}} {{Camera}} {{in lang|fr}}</ref> The former palace of the Genoese governors houses the municipal  museum, formerly the Ethnology Museum of Corsica.<ref>[http://www.musee-bastia.com/ Bastia Museum website] {{in lang|fr}}</ref> Abutting the old fortress tower and decorated with a 14th-century [[campanile]], the Palace of Governors over the centuries guarded Terra Nova and beyond the ramparts of the Old Port.

He also applied early forms of [[protocol analysis]] to these experiments. His PhD on \u2018Human and Machine Roles in Computer Aided Design\u2019 was expanded into the book ''The Automated Architect'' (1977), which was critical of some of the computer-aided architectural design work of that time.\nIn 1971, Cross co-organised the first major conference of the [[Design Research Society]] (DRS), on Design Participation. He continued to play significant roles in DRS, and was its President from 2006-2017.\n\nEarly interests in [[Design|design methods]] led to an edited book of foundational papers, ''Developments in Design Methodology'' (1984) and a textbook of ''Engineering Design Methods'' (1989, now in a 4th edition).\n\nSubsequently his research interests turned more to design cognition or [[design thinking]]. In 1991 Cross established, with colleagues at [[Delft University of Technology]], the international series of Design Thinking Research Symposia (DTRS).<ref>Cross, N.

Cross helped clarify and develop the concept of [[design thinking]] (or \"designerly ways of knowing\") as a domain-independent discipline.<ref>Cross, N. 'Developing design as a discipline', Journal of Engineering Design, Vol. 29, pp. 691-708, 2018. ISSN 0954-4828</ref> He is one of the key people of the [[Design Research Society]].\n\n==Research==\n\nNigel Cross began his [[Design|design research]] in the 1960s with studies of \"simulated\" [[computer-aided design]] systems where the purported simulator was actually a human operator, using text and graphical communication via [[CCTV]]. Cross later referred to this as a kind of [[Reverse Turing test]];<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1162/07479360152681083 |jstor=1511919 |title=Can a Machine Design? |journal=Design Issues |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=44\u201350 |year=2001 |last1=Cross |first1=Nigel |url=http://oro.open.ac.uk/3275/1/Can_a_machine_design.pdf }}</ref> in interaction design this kind of study later became known as a [[Wizard of Oz experiment]]. He also applied early forms of [[protocol analysis]] to these experiments. His PhD on \u2018Human and Machine Roles in Computer Aided Design\u2019 was expanded into the book ''The Automated Architect'' (1977), which was critical of some of the computer-aided architectural design work of that time.\nIn 1971, Cross co-organised the first major conference of the [[Design Research Society]] (DRS), on Design Participation. He continued to play significant roles in DRS, and was its President from 2006-2017.\n\nEarly interests in [[Design|design methods]] led to an edited book of foundational papers, ''Developments in Design Methodology'' (1984) and a textbook of ''Engineering Design Methods'' (1989, now in a 4th edition).\n\nSubsequently his research interests turned more to design cognition or [[design thinking]]. In 1991 Cross established, with colleagues at [[Delft University of Technology]], the international series of Design Thinking Research Symposia (DTRS).<ref>Cross, N.

His most famous character, a hapless little man named \"[[Mr. Rossi|Signor Rossi]]\" (Mr. Rossi), has been featured in many animated shorts as well as starring in three feature films: ''Mr. Rossi Looks for Happiness'' (1976), ''Mr. Rossi's Dreams'' (1977), and ''Mr. Rossi's Vacation'' (1977).\n\n==Biography==\nIn 1965, Bozzetto produced his first feature-length animated film: ''[[West and Soda]]'', a parody of American Western films.

After a long break, Bozzetto produced a live-action film in 1987, ''[[Under the Chinese Restaurant]]'', his last feature film work until assisting on the pilot for ''Mammuk'' (2002), an animated film set in prehistoric times (now being produced by Rai Cinema and The Animation Band).\n\n1990 saw the release of ''[[Grasshoppers (Cavallette)]]'', which was an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominee for the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]]. <ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX7pyzjOHHQ Short Film Winners:1991 Oscars]</ref>\n\nIn 1995, he produced an animated short for [[Hanna-Barbera]]/[[Cartoon Network Studios]]' ''[[What a Cartoon!]]'' series entitled ''Help?'' and in 1996, in cooperation with RAI and with the support of Cartoon (Media Programme of the European Union), he created ''[[The Spaghetti Family]]'' a 26-episode cartoon television series.\n\nIn recent years, Bozzetto has turned the animation from traditional cel to [[flash cartoon]]s, most notably with the award-winning ''Europe and Italy'', a witty and graphically elegant commentary on European vs. Italian socio-cultural attributes.
