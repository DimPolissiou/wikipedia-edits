Most stops are {{convert|32.2|m|abbr=on}} long. They are virtually level with the doors and are all wider than {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}}. This allows [[wheelchair]]s, [[Baby transport#Wheeled devices|prams]], [[Baby transport#Wheeled devices|pushchairs]] and the elderly to board the tram easily with no steps. In street sections, the stop is integrated with the pavement.\nThe tram stops have low platforms, {{convert|35|cm|abbr=on}} above rail level. They are unstaffed and had automated ticket machines that are no longer in use due to TfL making trams cashless. In general, access between the platforms involves crossing the tracks by pedestrian level crossing.\n\nTramlink uses some former main-line stations on the Wimbledon\u2013West Croydon and Elmers End\u2013Coombe Lane stretches of line. The railway platforms have been demolished and rebuilt to Tramlink specifications, except at Elmers End and Wimbledon where the track level was raised to meet the higher main-line platforms to enable [[cross-platform interchange]].\n\nAll stops have disabled access, raised paving, CCTV, a Passenger Help Point, a Passenger Information Display (PID), litter bins, a ticket machine, a noticeboard and lamp-posts, and most also have seats and a shelter.\n\nThe PIDs display the destinations and expected arrival times of the next two trams.

The plans involve dual-tracking across the network and introducing diverting loops on either side of Croydon, allowing for a higher frequency of trams on all four branches of the network without increasing congestion in Croydon metropolitan centre; the \u00a3737m investment programme is to be funded partially by the Croydon Growth Zone, TfL Business Plan, housing levies, and the respective boroughs, as well as partially by the affected developers.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web |url=http://content.tfl.gov.uk/trams-for-growth-presentation.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=15 December 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220132721/http://content.tfl.gov.uk/trams-for-growth-presentation.pdf |archivedate=20 December 2016  }}</ref> The plans are outlined in three phases consisting of six outputs:\n\n====Phase A====\nTo support developments in Croydon, construction of a diverting loop in East Croydon has been proposed at Dingwall Road. This loop would run up Dingwall Road alongside the [[Ruskin Square]] development, call at a new stop on Lansdowne Road, and return to the Croydon loop before the Wellesley Road stop (refurbished to accommodate for higher ridership); services originating from New Addington would alternate between using the main Croydon loop and this loop before returning to New Addington, although the services around the Croydon loop may be phased out.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/tramlink/dingwall-road-loop-extension/user_uploads/dingwall-2015-consultation-report.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=15 December 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220133627/https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/tramlink/dingwall-road-loop-extension/user_uploads/dingwall-2015-consultation-report.pdf |archivedate=20 December 2016  }}</ref><ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/> The aim of this is to increase the number services both around the Croydon loop and to Wimbledon originating from Elmers End to meet demand; to accommodate this increase in services, dual-tracking of line after Arena and the construction of a second platform at Elmers End is required.<ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/> This is fully committed, partially funded by TfL and partially by the Croydon Partnership of [[Westfield Corporation|Westfield]] and [[Hammerson]], with construction to begin in 2017 and to be completed by 2020. However, in the final masterplan planning application approved by Croydon Council and the Mayor of London, commitment by the Croydon Partnership to partially funding the loop was withdrawn, leading TfL and Croydon Council to review the affordability of the scheme.<ref>https://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/news/croydon-news/doubt-cast-over-funding-croydon-1387988</ref> In May 2018, it was announced a third of the cost for Elmers End improvements would be funded from the TfL Growth Fund, with work proposed to start later in the year.<ref>http://www.metro-report.com/news/single-view/view/london-tram-enhancements-included-in-growth-fund.html</ref>\n\n====Phase B====\nAn increase in capacity westwards from Croydon centre could support housing growth at industrial and commercial areas in the Wandle Valley area; this could help fund the schemes through a housing levy, although this would require changes in planning allocation from both Croydon and Sutton councils.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> To achieve this, dual-tracking between Beddington Lane and Mitcham Junction and a second platform at Wimbledon was completed in November 2015, allowing for an initial 50% increase in capacity when the network was extended to Wimbledon.<ref>{{cite press release |url= https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2015/november/wimbledon-tram-stop-reopens-with-new-platform |title= Wimbledon tram stop reopens with new platform |author= Transport for London |website= tfl.gov.uk |accessdate= 9 May 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170729054724/https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2015/november/wimbledon-tram-stop-reopens-with-new-platform |archivedate= 29 July 2017 }}</ref> To further increase capacity by ~150%, a series of bottlenecks are proposed to be either resolved or avoided: as well as dual-tracking of line at Phipps Bridge and on the Wandle Flyover (between Reeves Corner and Wandle Park), a new route has been proposed between a spur in [[South Wimbledon tube station|South Wimbledon]] or [[Colliers Wood tube station|Colliers Wood]] and a reversing loop in Old Town, Croydon to avoid constraints at Wimbledon station and in Croydon.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This line could provide connections to the South Wimbledon/Colliers Wood Area for Intensification and the Northern Line, as well as supporting connections to the proposed [[London Overground#Future acquisitions|South London Metro]] at Mitcham Junction and West Croydon.<ref name=\"london.gov.uk\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The new service could initially run between Morden Road and Croydon before being extended to the new spur.<ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/> New stops would be built in South Wimbledon/Colliers Wood and in Old Town (initially proposed as Frith Road), as well as an additional platform at Reeves Corner for westward services.<ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This plan may be in service by 2023.<ref name=\"gov.uk\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/595947/london-south-coast-rail-corridor.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=11 July 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425134041/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/595947/london-south-coast-rail-corridor.pdf |archivedate=25 April 2017  }}</ref>\n\n====Phase C====\nA 25% increase in capacity could be achieved by the introduction of another passing loop on the Beckenham Junction branch; the extra services could either be fed through Croydon centre or around the Dingwall Loop; this could be in place by 2027.<ref name=\"gov.uk\"/> Furthermore, if extra capacity is required, tram stops could be lengthened to serve either longer trams or two trams coupled together on services between Wimbledon and Beckenham Junction or Elmers End; however, the expense required as well as issues from lengthening stops in the Croydon centre may prevent this.<ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\nThis would be in place by 2029.<ref name=\"gov.uk\"/>\n\n====Other developments====\nThese developments could see an increase in fleet from 30 to up to 80 trams (depending on whether longer trams or coupled trams are used). As such, an increase in depot and stabling capacity across the whole 15-year plan is also required; an enlargement of the current Therapia Lane site as well as sites near the Elmers End and Harrington Road tram stops have been shortlisted.<ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/> Furthermore, plans for increases in capacity at Wimbledon are supported long-term with the redesign of the station as part of plans of Crossrail 2 and at East Croydon as part of plans for an upgrade of the [[Brighton Main Line]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\nThe plan also is designed to accommodate the long-term aim of extending services to Crystal Palace.\n\n===Sutton to Wimbledon (Sutton Link)===\nThe only Tramlink extension actively being pursued by the Mayor of London and TfL, as of 2018, is a new line between Sutton and Wimbledon ([[Sutton Link]]). Depending on the route chosen, this could support Opportunity Areas at Wimbledon and Sutton, the South Wimbledon/Colliers Wood Area for Intensification, the Morden Housing Zone, and intensification along the route at Rose Hill. The extension aims to support the delivery of at least 10,000 homes and thousands of jobs.<ref>https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/new_london_plan_december_2017.pdf</ref> A further extension to the new London Cancer Hub on the same site of the [[The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust|Royal Marsden Hospital]] and [[Institute of Cancer Research]] in [[Belmont, Sutton|Belmont]] has also been proposed as a long-term part of the development.<ref>https://www.sutton.gov.uk/info/200547/business/1514/the_london_cancer_hub/7</ref>\n\nIn the London 2050 infrastructure plan, an extension of the Tramlink to Sutton was given a medium priority with a timescale of 2030.<ref>https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Transport%20Supporting%20Paper_3.pdf</ref>\n\nIn July 2013, Mayor [[Boris Johnson]] affirmed that there is a reasonable business case for Tramlink to cover the Wimbledon - Sutton corridor. A map has been released showing the planned route. It would leave the existing route just to the east of Morden Road and head along the A24 and A297 to Rosehill Roundabout, then the B2230 through Sutton town centre, ending at the station. A loop via St Helier Hospital and a possible extension to Royal Marsden Hospital also were proposed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/10557415.Boris_tells_City_Hall_there_is__reasonable_business_case__for_extending_tram_route_to_Sutton/|title=Boris tells City Hall there is 'reasonable business case' for extending tram route to Sutton|website=Your Local Guardian|accessdate=9 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304120504/http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/10557415.Boris_tells_City_Hall_there_is__reasonable_business_case__for_extending_tram_route_to_Sutton/|archivedate=4 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, a proposed \u00a3320m scheme for a new line to connect Wimbledon to Sutton via Morden was made and brought to consultation jointly by the London Boroughs of Merton and Sutton. The consultation aimed to gauge support for the extension, as well as for different routes proposed.<ref>https://www.opportunitysutton.org/wp-content/uploads/Tramlink_Report_FINAL1.pdf</ref> The consultation offered three choices of northern terminus (Wimbledon, South Wimbledon on-street, South Wimbledon off-street), with or without the loop serving St Helier's Hospital directly, and for the Sutton loop to either run entirely around the Sutton gyratory or divert north along the High Street. The results overwhelmingly supported the extension, with majorities supporting the northern terminus at Wimbledon, including a loop to serve St Helier's Hospital, and running entirely around the gyratory.

Also, both routes 1 and 2 had potential for a direct link between [[Wimbledon station]] (with route 2 the easier route) and a potential loop for a direct connection with [[St Helier Hospital]]. Route 3 however has only been proposed to be delivered as a tram route at \u00a3300m, with [[Thameslink]] services terminating at [[West Sutton railway station|West Sutton]] and Wimbledon. Services on the intermediate stations would however be more frequent as a tram service than currently. Work could begin in 2022, with aim for completing in 2025.<ref>https://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/16832779.routes-for-the-wimbledon-sutton-tramlink-extension-revealed/</ref> Services to Wimbledon regardless of route would however be postponed several years to co-ordinate with Crossrail 2 works, due to the low capacity on tram platforms in the station and to limit disruption.\n\nIn February 2020, TfL announced their preference for a north\u2013south tramway between Colliers Wood and Sutton town centre for \u00a3425m on the condition of securing additional funding.<ref name=\"consultations.tfl.gov.uk\"/>\n\n===Projected extensions===\nThe Mayor's Transport Strategy for London states that extensions to the network could be developed at relatively modest cost where there is potential demand from existing and new development to support concentrated passenger movements, and where Tramlink technology might be cost effective.

Beyond Purley, an extension to [[Coulsdon]] will be investigated. As this would be close to the [[M23 motorway]], a possibility would be the construction of a [[park and ride]] site. Finding a good alignment will be more difficult south of Purley, where Brighton Road is the [[A23 road|A23 trunk road]].<ref name=\"spext\"/>\n\nTo the north of Croydon, it is proposed to use a highway alignment based on London Road. To the south of [[Thornton Heath Pond]], the use of a shared carriageway is a possibility.

As turnround times were already quite tight this raised the issue of buying an extra tram to maintain punctuality. Partly for this reason but also to take into account the planned restructuring of services (subsequently introduced in July 2006), TfL issued tenders for a new tram. However, nothing resulted from this.\n\nIn January 2011, Tramtrack Croydon opened a tender for the supply of ten new or second-hand trams from the end of summer 2011, for use between Therapia Lane and Elmers End.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/london-tramlink-seeks-bids-for-additional-trams.html |title=London Tramlink seeks bids for additional trams |date=31 January 2011 |magazine=[[Railway Gazette International]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102131738/http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/london-tramlink-seeks-bids-for-additional-trams.html |archivedate=2 November 2012  }}</ref><ref>Rail Magazine page 16, 'News in Brief \u2013 New Trams for Croydon' Issue 663, 9 \u2013 22 February 2011</ref><ref name=rgi20110818/> On 18 August 2011, TfL announced that [[Stadler Rail]] had won a $19.75 million contract to supply six [[Variotram|Variobahn]] trams similar to those used by [[Bergen Light Rail|Bybanen]] in [[Bergen]], Norway.<ref name=rgi20110818>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/stadler-wins-london-tramlink-tram-order.html |title=Stadler wins London Tramlink tram order |date=18 August 2011 |magazine=[[Railway Gazette International]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917051215/http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/stadler-wins-london-tramlink-tram-order.html |archivedate=17 September 2011  }}</ref> They entered service in 2012.<ref name=RailwayGazette21Aug13>[http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/urban/single-view/view/london-tramlink-orders-more-stadler-trams.html London Tramlink orders more Stadlet trams] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103134936/http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/urban/single-view/view/london-tramlink-orders-more-stadler-trams.html |date=3 January 2017 }} ''Railway Gazette'' 21 August 2013</ref> In August 2013, TfL ordered an additional four Variotrams for delivery in 2015, for use on the Wimbledon to Croydon link, an order which was later increased to six.

Most stops are {{convert|32.2|m|abbr=on}} long. They are virtually level with the doors and are all wider than {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}}. This allows [[wheelchair]]s, [[Baby transport#Wheeled devices|prams]], [[Baby transport#Wheeled devices|pushchairs]] and the elderly to board the tram easily with no steps. In street sections, the stop is integrated with the pavement.\nThe tram stops have low platforms, {{convert|35|cm|abbr=on}} above rail level. They are unstaffed and had automated ticket machines that are no longer in use due to TfL making trams cashless. In general, access between the platforms involves crossing the tracks by pedestrian level crossing.\n\nTramlink uses some former main-line stations on the Wimbledon\u2013West Croydon and Elmers End\u2013Coombe Lane stretches of line. The railway platforms have been demolished and rebuilt to Tramlink specifications, except at Elmers End and Wimbledon where the track level was raised to meet the higher main-line platforms to enable [[cross-platform interchange]].\n\nAll stops have disabled access, raised paving, CCTV, a Passenger Help Point, a Passenger Information Display (PID), litter bins, a ticket machine, a noticeboard and lamp-posts, and most also have seats and a shelter.\n\nThe PIDs display the destinations and expected arrival times of the next two trams. They can also display any message the controllers want to display, such as information on delays or even safety instructions for vandals to stop putting rubbish or other objects onto the track.\n\n===Routes===\n[[File:Tramlink Route 2 at Beckenham Junction.jpg|thumb|Tram 2545 in original livery at [[Beckenham Junction]] in 2001.]]\n[[File:Tramlink-Tram2536-03.jpg|thumb|Tram 2536 in the second livery at [[Morden Road tram stop|Morden Road]], heading towards Wimbledon in 2006.]]\n[[File:Tram at Reeves Corner, Croydon - geograph.org.uk - 1238898.jpg|thumb|A tram leaving Croydon towards Wimbledon, going past [[Reeves Corner]] in 2009.]]\n[[File:Au Morandarte Flickr Tramlink 2558 on Route 1, East Croydon (9756077682).jpg|thumb|Tram 2558 at [[East Croydon]] in 2013.]]\n\nTramlink has been shown on the principal [[tube map]] since 1 June 2016, having previously appeared only on the [[Tube map#Official versions of the Tube map|\"London Connections\" map]].\n\nWhen Tramlink first opened it had three routes: Line 1 (yellow) from [[Wimbledon station|Wimbledon]] to [[Elmers End station|Elmers End]], Line 2 (red) from Croydon to [[Beckenham Junction station|Beckenham Junction]], and Line 3 (green) from Croydon to [[New Addington tram stop|New Addington]].<ref name=\"Tramlink p 10\">''Tramlink: Your top 10 questions answered\u2026'' Poster, 1995.</ref> On 23 July 2006 the network was restructured, with Route 1 from Elmers End to Croydon, Route 2 from Beckenham Junction to Croydon and Route 3 from New Addington to Wimbledon. In June 2012 Route 4 from Therapia Lane to Elmers End was introduced. On Monday 4 April 2016, Route 4 was extended from Therapia Lane to Wimbledon.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Transport for London]]|title=Tram-endous boost for travellers|url=https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/news-articles/tram-endous-boost-for-travellers|date=4 April 2016|access-date=19 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513142204/https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/news-articles/tram-endous-boost-for-travellers|archive-date=13 May 2016 }}</ref>\n\nOn 25 February 2018, the network and timetables were restructured again for more even and reliable services.

The plans involve dual-tracking across the network and introducing diverting loops on either side of Croydon, allowing for a higher frequency of trams on all four branches of the network without increasing congestion in Croydon metropolitan centre; the \u00a3737m investment programme is to be funded partially by the Croydon Growth Zone, TfL Business Plan, housing levies, and the respective boroughs, as well as partially by the affected developers.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web |url=http://content.tfl.gov.uk/trams-for-growth-presentation.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=15 December 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220132721/http://content.tfl.gov.uk/trams-for-growth-presentation.pdf |archivedate=20 December 2016  }}</ref> The plans are outlined in three phases consisting of six outputs:\n\n====Phase A====\nTo support developments in Croydon, construction of a diverting loop in East Croydon has been proposed at Dingwall Road. This loop would run up Dingwall Road alongside the [[Ruskin Square]] development, call at a new stop on Lansdowne Road, and return to the Croydon loop before the Wellesley Road stop (refurbished to accommodate for higher ridership); services originating from New Addington would alternate between using the main Croydon loop and this loop before returning to New Addington, although the services around the Croydon loop may be phased out.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/tramlink/dingwall-road-loop-extension/user_uploads/dingwall-2015-consultation-report.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=15 December 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220133627/https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/tramlink/dingwall-road-loop-extension/user_uploads/dingwall-2015-consultation-report.pdf |archivedate=20 December 2016  }}</ref><ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/> The aim of this is to increase the number services both around the Croydon loop and to Wimbledon originating from Elmers End to meet demand; to accommodate this increase in services, dual-tracking of line after Arena and the construction of a second platform at Elmers End is required.<ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/> This is fully committed, partially funded by TfL and partially by the Croydon Partnership of [[Westfield Corporation|Westfield]] and [[Hammerson]], with construction to begin in 2017 and to be completed by 2020. However, in the final masterplan planning application approved by Croydon Council and the Mayor of London, commitment by the Croydon Partnership to partially funding the loop was withdrawn, leading TfL and Croydon Council to review the affordability of the scheme.<ref>https://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/news/croydon-news/doubt-cast-over-funding-croydon-1387988</ref> In May 2018, it was announced a third of the cost for Elmers End improvements would be funded from the TfL Growth Fund, with work proposed to start later in the year.<ref>http://www.metro-report.com/news/single-view/view/london-tram-enhancements-included-in-growth-fund.html</ref>\n\n====Phase B====\nAn increase in capacity westwards from Croydon centre could support housing growth at industrial and commercial areas in the Wandle Valley area; this could help fund the schemes through a housing levy, although this would require changes in planning allocation from both Croydon and Sutton councils.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> To achieve this, dual-tracking between Beddington Lane and Mitcham Junction and a second platform at Wimbledon was completed in November 2015, allowing for an initial 50% increase in capacity when the network was extended to Wimbledon.<ref>{{cite press release |url= https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2015/november/wimbledon-tram-stop-reopens-with-new-platform |title= Wimbledon tram stop reopens with new platform |author= Transport for London |website= tfl.gov.uk |accessdate= 9 May 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170729054724/https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2015/november/wimbledon-tram-stop-reopens-with-new-platform |archivedate= 29 July 2017 }}</ref> To further increase capacity by ~150%, a series of bottlenecks are proposed to be either resolved or avoided: as well as dual-tracking of line at Phipps Bridge and on the Wandle Flyover (between Reeves Corner and Wandle Park), a new route has been proposed between a spur in [[South Wimbledon tube station|South Wimbledon]] or [[Colliers Wood tube station|Colliers Wood]] and a reversing loop in Old Town, Croydon to avoid constraints at Wimbledon station and in Croydon.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This line could provide connections to the South Wimbledon/Colliers Wood Area for Intensification and the Northern Line, as well as supporting connections to the proposed [[London Overground#Future acquisitions|South London Metro]] at Mitcham Junction and West Croydon.<ref name=\"london.gov.uk\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The new service could initially run between Morden Road and Croydon before being extended to the new spur.<ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/> New stops would be built in South Wimbledon/Colliers Wood and in Old Town (initially proposed as Frith Road), as well as an additional platform at Reeves Corner for westward services.<ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This plan may be in service by 2023.<ref name=\"gov.uk\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/595947/london-south-coast-rail-corridor.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=11 July 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425134041/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/595947/london-south-coast-rail-corridor.pdf |archivedate=25 April 2017  }}</ref>\n\n====Phase C====\nA 25% increase in capacity could be achieved by the introduction of another passing loop on the Beckenham Junction branch; the extra services could either be fed through Croydon centre or around the Dingwall Loop; this could be in place by 2027.<ref name=\"gov.uk\"/> Furthermore, if extra capacity is required, tram stops could be lengthened to serve either longer trams or two trams coupled together on services between Wimbledon and Beckenham Junction or Elmers End; however, the expense required as well as issues from lengthening stops in the Croydon centre may prevent this.<ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\nThis would be in place by 2029.<ref name=\"gov.uk\"/>\n\n====Other developments====\nThese developments could see an increase in fleet from 30 to up to 80 trams (depending on whether longer trams or coupled trams are used).

Depending on the route chosen, this could support Opportunity Areas at Wimbledon and Sutton, the South Wimbledon/Colliers Wood Area for Intensification, the Morden Housing Zone, and intensification along the route at Rose Hill. The extension aims to support the delivery of at least 10,000 homes and thousands of jobs.<ref>https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/new_london_plan_december_2017.pdf</ref> A further extension to the new London Cancer Hub on the same site of the [[The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust|Royal Marsden Hospital]] and [[Institute of Cancer Research]] in [[Belmont, Sutton|Belmont]] has also been proposed as a long-term part of the development.<ref>https://www.sutton.gov.uk/info/200547/business/1514/the_london_cancer_hub/7</ref>\n\nIn the London 2050 infrastructure plan, an extension of the Tramlink to Sutton was given a medium priority with a timescale of 2030.<ref>https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Transport%20Supporting%20Paper_3.pdf</ref>\n\nIn July 2013, Mayor [[Boris Johnson]] affirmed that there is a reasonable business case for Tramlink to cover the Wimbledon - Sutton corridor. A map has been released showing the planned route. It would leave the existing route just to the east of Morden Road and head along the A24 and A297 to Rosehill Roundabout, then the B2230 through Sutton town centre, ending at the station. A loop via St Helier Hospital and a possible extension to Royal Marsden Hospital also were proposed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/10557415.Boris_tells_City_Hall_there_is__reasonable_business_case__for_extending_tram_route_to_Sutton/|title=Boris tells City Hall there is 'reasonable business case' for extending tram route to Sutton|website=Your Local Guardian|accessdate=9 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304120504/http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/10557415.Boris_tells_City_Hall_there_is__reasonable_business_case__for_extending_tram_route_to_Sutton/|archivedate=4 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, a proposed \u00a3320m scheme for a new line to connect Wimbledon to Sutton via Morden was made and brought to consultation jointly by the London Boroughs of Merton and Sutton. The consultation aimed to gauge support for the extension, as well as for different routes proposed.<ref>https://www.opportunitysutton.org/wp-content/uploads/Tramlink_Report_FINAL1.pdf</ref> The consultation offered three choices of northern terminus (Wimbledon, South Wimbledon on-street, South Wimbledon off-street), with or without the loop serving St Helier's Hospital directly, and for the Sutton loop to either run entirely around the Sutton gyratory or divert north along the High Street. The results overwhelmingly supported the extension, with majorities supporting the northern terminus at Wimbledon, including a loop to serve St Helier's Hospital, and running entirely around the gyratory.

Also, both routes 1 and 2 had potential for a direct link between [[Wimbledon station]] (with route 2 the easier route) and a potential loop for a direct connection with [[St Helier Hospital]]. Route 3 however has only been proposed to be delivered as a tram route at \u00a3300m, with [[Thameslink]] services terminating at [[West Sutton railway station|West Sutton]] and Wimbledon. Services on the intermediate stations would however be more frequent as a tram service than currently. Work could begin in 2022, with aim for completing in 2025.<ref>https://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/16832779.routes-for-the-wimbledon-sutton-tramlink-extension-revealed/</ref> Services to Wimbledon regardless of route would however be postponed several years to co-ordinate with Crossrail 2 works, due to the low capacity on tram platforms in the station and to limit disruption.\n\nIn February 2020, TfL announced their preference for a north\u2013south tramway between Colliers Wood and Sutton town centre for \u00a3425m on the condition of securing additional funding.<ref name=\"consultations.tfl.gov.uk\"/>\n\n===Projected extensions===\nThe Mayor's Transport Strategy for London states that extensions to the network could be developed at relatively modest cost where there is potential demand from existing and new development to support concentrated passenger movements, and where Tramlink technology might be cost effective.

Beyond Purley, an extension to [[Coulsdon]] will be investigated. As this would be close to the [[M23 motorway]], a possibility would be the construction of a [[park and ride]] site. Finding a good alignment will be more difficult south of Purley, where Brighton Road is the [[A23 road|A23 trunk road]].<ref name=\"spext\"/>\n\nTo the north of Croydon, it is proposed to use a highway alignment based on London Road.

He was a major figure in establishing the 16th-century \"English Mission\" of the [[Society of Jesus]].\n\n==Early life==\nRobert Persons was born at [[Nether Stowey]], [[Somerset]] to [[yeoman]] parents. Through the favour of local parson named John Hayward, a former monk, he was educated in 1562 at [[St. Mary's Hall, Oxford]]. After completing his degrees with distinction, he became a fellow and tutor at [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]] in 1568.<ref name=pollen>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11729a.htm Pollen, John Hungerford. \"Robert Persons.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 11.

Through discussion and encouraged by pupillage with [[William Good (Jesuit)|Father William Good, SJ]], he travelled overseas to become a Jesuit priest at St Paul's, Rome on 3 July 1575.\n\n==English mission: 1580\u20131581==\nPersons accompanied [[Edmund Campion]] on his mission to fellow English Catholics in 1580. The Jesuit General, [[Everard Mercurian]], had been reluctant to involve the Society directly in English ecumenical affairs. He was persuaded by an Italian Jesuit provincial, and later by Superior General [[Claudio Acquaviva]], after [[William Allen (cardinal)|William Cardinal Allen]] had found Mercurian resistant to change in October 1579.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Persons fast tracked English recruits to the Jesuits, and planned to set up cooperation with the remaining English [[secular clergy]]. He became impatient with Father Good's approach to the situation. Campion was much less of an enthusiast than he was.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Thomas M.

Persons and Campion only learned of this event in [[Reims]] while they were en route to England. After the initial invasion force under the mercenary [[Thomas Stukley]] had achieved nothing successful in 1578, the intervention under FitzGerald caused the English authorities to monitor the [[recusancy|recusants]] closely, and try to finance the campaign against the papal forces with exactions from them.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Thomas M.

This action then resulted in a petition from Pounde to the Privy Council to allow a disputation where the Jesuits would take on [[Robert Crowley (printer)|Robert Crowley]] and [[Henry Tripp]], who used to preach to the [[Marshalsea]] inmates. Campion and Persons also prepared their own personal statements, to be kept in reserve. The immediate consequence was that Pounde was then transferred to [[Bishop's Stortford Castle]]; but the prepared statement by Campion was later circulated soon after his capture.<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=69038|title=Pounde, Thomas|first=Thomas M.|last=McCoog}}</ref>\n\nMuch of the time Persons spent in England was taken up with covert printing, and pamphleteering. He made his negative view on church [[Papist|papism]] clear to the local Catholic clergy, before a synod in [[Southwark]]. The secret printing press needed to be relocated, moving it in early 1581 to [[Stonor Park]]. Campion was captured in July of that year; and then [[Stephen Brinkley]], who ran the printing press, was taken captive in August. Quite soon after that date Persons left for France.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> His underlying strategy of trying to embarrass the English government by demanding a forum for his ideals was consistent with the general approach of Allen and Persons, but met with much criticism from the Catholic members. Allen and Parsons persisted with their demand for another two years, but Jesuit opinion was against further confrontation. Campion was forced into disputation in the [[Tower of London]] under adverse conditions.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Thomas M.

He was in close contact with [[Henry I, Duke of Guise]], and through the Duke founded a school for English boys at [[Eu, Seine-Maritime|Eu]], on the coast to the north-east. [[William Creighton (Jesuit)|Father William Creighton, SJ]], was on the way to Scotland. He arrived in January 1582 and was briefed by Persons and the duke. In April Creighton returned with word from [[Esm\u00e9 Stewart, 1st Duke of Lennox]]; and they went to Paris to confer with [[William Allen (cardinal)|William Allen]], [[James Beaton (archbishop of Glasgow)|James Beaton]] and Claude Mathieu, Jesuit provincial in France, on his military plans and the imprisoned [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]. The scheme, which Persons supported confidently, advanced further, but was stopped after the [[raid of Ruthven]] of August 1582. One consequence was that Allen was made Cardinal, as Persons had recommended.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nA new enterprise was projected for September 1583, this time through England. Persons was sent by the Duke of Guise with written instructions to Rome. He returned to [[Flanders]], and stayed for some time at the court of the [[Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma|Duke of Parma]]. The discovery of the [[Throckmorton Plot]] disrupted the plan, and the Duke of Guise became absorbed in French domestic affairs. [[Philip II of Spain]] took over the lead, placed the Duke of Parma in charge, and limited involvement to Persons, Allen, and Hew Owen.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nIt was during this period that Persons was involved in the work later known as ''[[Leicester's Commonwealth]]''. Distributed covertly, it came to light in 1584. Persons is now generally thought not to be the author.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> The British historian John Bossy, from the University of York, is inclined to disagree.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Thomas M.

Correspondingly his own standing suffered in some quarters.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Claudio Acquaviva by the end of the year was concerned that the Jesuit strategies for France and the English mission would turn out to be inconsistent in the longer term, and consulted Pope Gregory XIII on the matter.

At this period Allen and Persons made a close study of the [[succession to Elizabeth I of England]], working with noted genealogist Robert Heighinton.<ref name=\"DNB\"/> Persons took his vows of final profession in the Jesuits in Rome on 7 May 1587.\n\n==Later life==\nPersons was sent to Spain at the close of 1588 to conciliate [[Philip II of Spain]], who was offended with [[Claudio Acquaviva]]. Persons was successful, and then made use of the royal favour to found the seminaries of [[English College, Valladolid|Valladolid]], [[English College of St Gregory|Seville]], and [[Madrid]] (1589, 1592, 1598) and the residences of [[San-Lucar]] and of [[Lisbon]] (which became a college in 1622). He then succeeded in establishing at [[Saint-Omer|St Omer]] (1594) a larger institution to which the boys from Eu were transferred. It is the institutional ancestor of [[Stonyhurst College]].<ref name=pollen/>\n\nIn 1596, in [[Seville]], he wrote ''Memorial for the Reformation of England'', which gave in some detail a blueprint for the kind of society England was to become after its return to the faith. He had hoped to succeed [[William Allen (cardinal)|Allen]] as Cardinal on the latter's death.

He was a major figure in establishing the 16th-century \"English Mission\" of the [[Society of Jesus]].\n\n==Early life==\nRobert Persons was born at [[Nether Stowey]], [[Somerset]] to [[yeoman]] parents. Through the favour of local parson named John Hayward, a former monk, he was educated in 1562 at [[St. Mary's Hall, Oxford]]. After completing his degrees with distinction, he became a fellow and tutor at [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]] in 1568.<ref name=pollen>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11729a.htm Pollen, John Hungerford. \"Robert Persons.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 11.

Through discussion and encouraged by pupillage with [[William Good (Jesuit)|Father William Good, SJ]], he travelled overseas to become a Jesuit priest at St Paul's, Rome on 3 July 1575.\n\n==English mission: 1580\u20131581==\nPersons accompanied [[Edmund Campion]] on his mission to fellow English Catholics in 1580. The Jesuit General, [[Everard Mercurian]], had been reluctant to involve the Society directly in English ecumenical affairs. He was persuaded by an Italian Jesuit provincial, and later by Superior General [[Claudio Acquaviva]], after [[William Allen (cardinal)|William Cardinal Allen]] had found Mercurian resistant to change in October 1579.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Persons fast tracked English recruits to the Jesuits, and planned to set up cooperation with the remaining English [[secular clergy]]. He became impatient with Father Good's approach to the situation. Campion was much less of an enthusiast than he was.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Thomas M.

Persons and Campion only learned of this event in [[Reims]] while they were en route to England. After the initial invasion force under the mercenary [[Thomas Stukley]] had achieved nothing successful in 1578, the intervention under FitzGerald caused the English authorities to monitor the [[recusancy|recusants]] closely, and try to finance the campaign against the papal forces with exactions from them.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Thomas M.

This action then resulted in a petition from Pounde to the Privy Council to allow a disputation where the Jesuits would take on [[Robert Crowley (printer)|Robert Crowley]] and [[Henry Tripp]], who used to preach to the [[Marshalsea]] inmates. Campion and Persons also prepared their own personal statements, to be kept in reserve. The immediate consequence was that Pounde was then transferred to [[Bishop's Stortford Castle]]; but the prepared statement by Campion was later circulated soon after his capture.<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=69038|title=Pounde, Thomas|first=Thomas M.|last=McCoog}}</ref>\n\nMuch of the time Persons spent in England was taken up with covert printing, and pamphleteering. He made his negative view on church [[Papist|papism]] clear to the local Catholic clergy, before a synod in [[Southwark]]. The secret printing press needed to be relocated, moving it in early 1581 to [[Stonor Park]]. Campion was captured in July of that year; and then [[Stephen Brinkley]], who ran the printing press, was taken captive in August. Quite soon after that date Persons left for France.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> His underlying strategy of trying to embarrass the English government by demanding a forum for his ideals was consistent with the general approach of Allen and Persons, but met with much criticism from the Catholic members. Allen and Parsons persisted with their demand for another two years, but Jesuit opinion was against further confrontation. Campion was forced into disputation in the [[Tower of London]] under adverse conditions.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Thomas M.

He was in close contact with [[Henry I, Duke of Guise]], and through the Duke founded a school for English boys at [[Eu, Seine-Maritime|Eu]], on the coast to the north-east. [[William Creighton (Jesuit)|Father William Creighton, SJ]], was on the way to Scotland. He arrived in January 1582 and was briefed by Persons and the duke. In April Creighton returned with word from [[Esm\u00e9 Stewart, 1st Duke of Lennox]]; and they went to Paris to confer with [[William Allen (cardinal)|William Allen]], [[James Beaton (archbishop of Glasgow)|James Beaton]] and Claude Mathieu, Jesuit provincial in France, on his military plans and the imprisoned [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]. The scheme, which Persons supported confidently, advanced further, but was stopped after the [[raid of Ruthven]] of August 1582. One consequence was that Allen was made Cardinal, as Persons had recommended.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nA new enterprise was projected for September 1583, this time through England. Persons was sent by the Duke of Guise with written instructions to Rome. He returned to [[Flanders]], and stayed for some time at the court of the [[Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma|Duke of Parma]]. The discovery of the [[Throckmorton Plot]] disrupted the plan, and the Duke of Guise became absorbed in French domestic affairs. [[Philip II of Spain]] took over the lead, placed the Duke of Parma in charge, and limited involvement to Persons, Allen, and Hew Owen.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nIt was during this period that Persons was involved in the work later known as ''[[Leicester's Commonwealth]]''. Distributed covertly, it came to light in 1584. Persons is now generally thought not to be the author.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> The British historian John Bossy, from the University of York, is inclined to disagree.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Thomas M.

Persons was successful, and then made use of the royal favour to found the seminaries of [[English College, Valladolid|Valladolid]], [[English College of St Gregory|Seville]], and [[Madrid]] (1589, 1592, 1598) and the residences of [[San-Lucar]] and of [[Lisbon]] (which became a college in 1622). He then succeeded in establishing at [[Saint-Omer|St Omer]] (1594) a larger institution to which the boys from Eu were transferred. It is the institutional ancestor of [[Stonyhurst College]].<ref name=pollen/>\n\nIn 1596, in [[Seville]], he wrote ''Memorial for the Reformation of England'', which gave in some detail a blueprint for the kind of society England was to become after its return to the faith.

A year later, when support for the SD\u013d dropped below the threshold required to get into parliament, he left the party, saying he was disappointed with the way the government worked.<ref name=ref/> Fico acted as an independent MP until the 2002 elections.\n\nAs early as in the autumn of 1998, a four-person group consisting of Fico, his associate Frantisek Hat\u00e1r, political strategist Fedor Fla\u0161\u00edk, and media executive [[Monika Fla\u0161\u00edkov\u00e1-Be\u0148ov\u00e1]] had begun to discuss and lay plans for launching a new political party on the left.

Fico established himself as an opposition politician criticizing the unpopular reforms of the right-wing government of [[Mikul\u00e1\u0161 Dzurinda]].<ref name=ref/> In order to keep SMER from repeating the fate of his previous party, Fico introduced a strict set of regulations for his new party, called the \"clean hands\" policy.  The rules stipulated that no one with ties from the previous communist regime or people who had background with other political parties was allowed to hold party office.  This created a new generation of politicians uninvolved in previous corruption scandals; among them was [[Monika Fla\u0161\u00edkov\u00e1-Be\u0148ov\u00e1]], [[Robert Kali\u0148\u00e1k]] and [[Pavol Pa\u0161ka]].<ref name=tom/> Another rule was that all party chapters on the regional and local levels were to be 100% financially self-sufficient, and all financial donations were to be made public to the media.<ref name=ff/>\n\nBetween 2002 and 2006 Smer was the main opposition party in the Slovak parliament.

The reforms were generally perceived as very positive and successful by such international bodies as the [[International Monetary Fund]], the [[World Bank]] or the [[OECD]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.spectator.sk/articles/view/15440|title=OECD satisfied with Slovakia's economic performance|date=19 March 2008|publisher=Slovak Spectator}}</ref> However, the reforms negatively affected large segments of the population, particularly low wage earners, the unemployed, and welfare and other social assistance recipients. While in opposition, and more vocally during the election campaign, Fico vowed to reverse and cancel the majority of these reforms. However, upon taking office Fico adopted a more cautious approach, as he wanted to ensure Slovakia could fulfill the [[Maastricht criteria]] required for [[Euro currency]] adoption. This was successful, and Slovakia adopted the [[Euro]] on 1 January 2009.\n\n=== Labour policies ===\nAmong the reforms Fico introduced, several established standards as to how many times employees could be kept on as temporary workers instead of being given permanent contracts. Under legislation of the [[Mikul\u00e1\u0161 Dzurinda]] government, an employer could keep new staff as temps and create a two-tier workforce, which many did. Slovakia's labor policies are now generally in tune with most other EU states.\n\nAt the start of his second term as [[Prime Minister of Slovakia|Prime Minister]] in 2012, Fico introduced a new \"Labour Code,\" which granted entitlement to a lay-off notice period as well as severance pay, reduced overtime, making layoffs more expensive for employers, shorter temporary work contracts and more power for trade unions. In addition, it curbed the \u2018chaining\u2019 of fixed-term employment contracts, whereby currently it is possible to extend a fixed-term employment contract three times over three years.<ref>{{cite news|last=Liptakova|first=Jana|title=Revamped Labour Code gets mixed reception|url=http://spectator.sme.sk/articles/view/48105/3/revamped_labour_code_gets_mixed_reception.html|accessdate=16 March 2014|newspaper=Slovak Spectator}}</ref> The Code was revised in 2014 when it introduced severe restrictions of the work on agreement performed outside regular employment.

Truckers demanded that fuel prices be lowered to compensate for the tolls.<ref name=\"ft\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/83a0153e-fedb-11de-a677-00144feab49a.html|title=Slovakia gives in to truckers' demands|work=Financial Times|date=12 January 2010|accessdate=12 October 2011}}</ref> Fico initially refused to speak with representatives of the truckers, saying he would not \"be blackmailed\", but a few days later capitulated. The cuts given to truckers will amount to about \u20ac100,000,000.<ref name=\"ft\"/>\n\n=== Finance ===\nOne of few modifications Fico's government did implement was a slight modification to the unusual [[flat tax]] system introduced by the previous government, in a way that slightly decreased or eradicated a tax-free part of income for higher income earners. A lower [[value added tax]] was imposed on medications and books, though in spite of his election promises Fico failed to extend this onto a wider group of products such as groceries. Among the measures were controversial legislative changes which effectively banned private health insurance companies from generating profit.

Those conditions were amongst others; that the result of the [[2016 Slovak parliamentary election]] be respected, that the current ruling government coalition must continue, and lastly, that Smer-SD as the largest party currently in parliament name the next prime minister.

The reforms were generally perceived as very positive and successful by such international bodies as the [[International Monetary Fund]], the [[World Bank]] or the [[OECD]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.spectator.sk/articles/view/15440|title=OECD satisfied with Slovakia's economic performance|date=19 March 2008|publisher=Slovak Spectator}}</ref> However, the reforms negatively affected large segments of the population, particularly low wage earners, the unemployed, and welfare and other social assistance recipients. While in opposition, and more vocally during the election campaign, Fico vowed to reverse and cancel the majority of these reforms. However, upon taking office Fico adopted a more cautious approach, as he wanted to ensure Slovakia could fulfill the [[Maastricht criteria]] required for [[Euro currency]] adoption. This was successful, and Slovakia adopted the [[Euro]] on 1 January 2009.\n\n=== Labour policies ===\nAmong the reforms Fico introduced, several established standards as to how many times employees could be kept on as temporary workers instead of being given permanent contracts. Under legislation of the [[Mikul\u00e1\u0161 Dzurinda]] government, an employer could keep new staff as temps and create a two-tier workforce, which many did. Slovakia's labor policies are now generally in tune with most other EU states.\n\nAt the start of his second term as [[Prime Minister of Slovakia|Prime Minister]] in 2012, Fico introduced a new \"Labour Code,\" which granted entitlement to a lay-off notice period as well as severance pay, reduced overtime, making layoffs more expensive for employers, shorter temporary work contracts and more power for trade unions. In addition, it curbed the \u2018chaining\u2019 of fixed-term employment contracts, whereby currently it is possible to extend a fixed-term employment contract three times over three years.<ref>{{cite news|last=Liptakova|first=Jana|title=Revamped Labour Code gets mixed reception|url=http://spectator.sme.sk/articles/view/48105/3/revamped_labour_code_gets_mixed_reception.html|accessdate=16 March 2014|newspaper=Slovak Spectator}}</ref> The Code was revised in 2014 when it introduced severe restrictions of the work on agreement performed outside regular employment. Under the latest revision, employers will be able to conclude agreements with employees for 12 months only.<ref>{{cite news|title=Government approves limiting the duration of work on agreement|url=http://spectator.sme.sk/articles/view/53106/10/government_approves_limiting_the_duration_of_work_on_agreement.html|accessdate=16 March 2014|newspaper=Sme.sk|date=27 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, Fico faced large-scale protests and a blockade of major cities by truckers upset about what they considered to be badly implemented tolls on the highways. Truckers demanded that fuel prices be lowered to compensate for the tolls.<ref name=\"ft\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/83a0153e-fedb-11de-a677-00144feab49a.html|title=Slovakia gives in to truckers' demands|work=Financial Times|date=12 January 2010|accessdate=12 October 2011}}</ref> Fico initially refused to speak with representatives of the truckers, saying he would not \"be blackmailed\", but a few days later capitulated. The cuts given to truckers will amount to about \u20ac100,000,000.<ref name=\"ft\"/>\n\n=== Finance ===\nOne of few modifications Fico's government did implement was a slight modification to the unusual [[flat tax]] system introduced by the previous government, in a way that slightly decreased or eradicated a tax-free part of income for higher income earners. A lower [[value added tax]] was imposed on medications and books, though in spite of his election promises Fico failed to extend this onto a wider group of products such as groceries. Among the measures were controversial legislative changes which effectively banned private health insurance companies from generating profit. As a result, Slovakia is being sued by several foreign shareholders of local health insurers through international arbitrations.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.spectator.sk/articles/view/32427/10/slovakia_will_face_arbitration_for_health_insurance_profit_ban.html|title=Slovakia will face arbitration for health insurance profit ban|date=17 July 2008|publisher=Slovak Spectator}}</ref> In 2007, Fico unsuccessfully tried to regulate retail food prices, an unprecedented effort in a generally free market European Union.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.iness.sk/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=633|title=Fico attacks retail chains over rising prices|date=22 July 2007|publisher=Institute of Economic and Social Studies|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721024455/http://www.iness.sk/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=633|archivedate=21 July 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2008, Fico threatened the foreign shareholders of a local gas distributor SPP, the French Gaz de France and the German E.ON, with nationalization and seizure of their ownership shares in a dispute over retail gas prices.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.spectator.sk/articles/view/32696/10/fico_threatens_nationalisation_to_stop_energy_increases.html|title=Fico threatens nationalisation to stop energy increases|date=18 August 2008|publisher=Slovak Spectator}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/rbssUtilitiesElectric/idUSLI69531620080818|title=Slovak PM threatens to expropriate utilities-paper|date=18 August 2008|publisher=[[Reuters]]}}</ref>\n\n== Foreign policy ==\n=== European Union ===\n[[File:HANDSHAKE - BRATISLAVA SUMMIT 16.

Set in a decaying and morally bankrupt [[New York City]] following the [[Vietnam War]], the film tells the story of [[Travis Bickle]] (De Niro), a lonely taxi driver who descends into insanity as he plots to assassinate both the presidential candidate (Harris) for whom the woman he is infatuated with (Shepherd) works, and the pimp (Keitel) of an [[Child prostitution|underage prostitute]] (Foster) he befriends.\n\nA critical and commercial success upon release and nominated for four [[Academy Awards]], including for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (for De Niro) and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] (for Foster), ''Taxi Driver'' won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1976 Cannes Film Festival]]. The film generated controversy at the time of its release for its depiction of violence and casting of a 12-year-old Foster in the role of a child prostitute.\n\nIn 2012, ''[[Sight & Sound]]'' named it the 31st-best film ever in its decennial [[BFI The Top 50 Greatest Films of All Time|critics' poll]], ranked with ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'', and the fifth-greatest film of all time on its directors' poll. The film was considered \"culturally, historically or aesthetically\" significant by the US [[Library of Congress]] and was selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] in 1994.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1975, [[Travis Bickle]] is a lonely, [[Depression (mood)|depressed]] 26-year-old living in isolation in [[New York City]]. Travis takes a job as a night shift taxi driver to cope with his [[chronic insomnia]], driving passengers around the city's [[New York City borough|boroughs]]. He frequents [[Adult movie theater|porn theaters]] and keeps a diary in which he consciously attempts to include [[aphorisms]], such as \"You're only as healthy as you feel.\"\n\nTravis becomes infatuated with Betsy, a campaign volunteer for Senator and presidential candidate Charles Palantine. After watching her interact with fellow worker Tom through her window, Travis enters to volunteer as a pretext to talk to her, then takes her out for coffee.\n\nTravis is disgusted by the sleaze, dysfunction, and prostitution that he witnesses throughout the city, and [[Existential crisis|struggles to find meaning for his existence]]. His worldview is furthered when an adolescent prostitute and runaway, Iris, who uses the professional name \"Easy,\" enters his taxi, attempting to escape her [[pimp]], Sport. Sport drags Iris from the taxi and throws Travis a crumpled $20 bill, which continually reminds Travis of her and the corruption that surrounds him.\n\nTravis takes Betsy on a date to see a pornographic film, which offends her, and she goes home alone. His numerous attempts at reconciliation by sending flowers and apologizing over the phone are rebuffed, causing him to become embittered and convinced that she is exactly like the \"cold\" people he detests in the city. He finally confronts her at the campaign office, berating her before being kicked out by Tom.\n\nOne evening, an unhinged passenger gloats to Travis of his intention to kill his [[Adultery|adulterous]] wife and her black lover. Later, Travis joins fellow taxi drivers in a diner. Outside, he confides in Wizard about his \"bad\" thoughts, which are beginning to turn violent; Wizard assures him that he will be fine (\"Don't worry so much,\" he says), leaving Travis to his own destructive path.\n\nIn attempting to find an outlet for his frustrations, Travis begins a program of intense physical training. A fellow taxi driver refers him to an illegal gun dealer, \"Easy\" Andy, from whom Travis buys four handguns. At home, Travis practices [[Fast draw|drawing]] his weapons, and builds a rig to allow him to hide and quickly deploy one of his guns from his [[Sleeve gun|sleeve]]. He also begins attending Palantine's rallies to study their security. One night, Travis enters a convenience store seconds before a robber enters and holds the owner at gunpoint, leading Travis to fatally shoot the robber. To help him evade arrest, the store owner, an acquaintance of Travis, takes responsibility for the deed, claiming one of Travis's guns as his own.\n\nTravis seeks out Iris through Sport, and twice tries to convince her to stop prostituting herself, an effort which partially convinces her. After a breakfast with Iris, Travis mails her a letter containing money, imploring her to return home. Travis cuts his hair into a [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawk]] and attends a public rally, where he intends to assassinate Palantine. While attempting to pull out his gun, [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agents notice Travis putting his hand inside his coat and chase him down. Travis, however, successfully escapes the scene.\n\nThat evening, Travis drives to Sport's brothel in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]]. After Sport flicks a cigarette at Travis and derides him outside of the building, he shoots Sport and enters the brothel. Travis shoots the owner's fingers off before being shot in the neck by Sport, whom he fatally shoots in turn. Travis moves upstairs, pursued by the owner, where Iris's client shoots him in the shoulder; Travis kills the made man with the sleeve pistol, stabs the gangster in the hand and fatally shoots him with the made man's [[revolver]] as Iris cries out in terror. He attempts suicide with the revolver, only to find it empty; the police arrive and find a collapsed, bleeding Travis, who looks at them while pantomiming shooting himself before passing out from blood loss.\n\nTravis is not prosecuted, but instead, he is hailed as a local hero in the press, as the criminal dealings of those in the brothel were discovered and publicized. He receives a letter from Iris's father, thanking him for saving her and revealing that she has returned home to [[Pittsburgh]], where she is going to school. After weeks of recovery and returning to work, Travis  encounters Betsy as a fare. Travis drives her home, then refuses to let her pay the fare, driving away with a smile. As Travis drives off, he becomes suddenly agitated after noticing something in his rear-view mirror.\n\n== Cast ==\n<ref name=\"AFI\">{{cite web |url=http://catalog.afi.com/Film/67969-TAXI-DRIVER?sid=b658a8a0-9843-4955-9bd4-560b9f1553aa&sr=4.241532&cp=1&pos=0 |title=Taxi Driver |publisher=[[American Film Institute|AFI]] |accessdate=December 29, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181229172009/http://catalog.afi.com/Film/67969-TAXI-DRIVER?sid=b658a8a0-9843-4955-9bd4-560b9f1553aa&sr=4.241532&cp=1&pos=0|archive-date=December 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"BFI\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b7bc1b8 |title=Taxi Driver (1976) |publisher=[[British Film Institute|BFI]] |accessdate=December 29, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181229171911/https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b7bc1b8|archive-date=December 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as [[Travis Bickle]]\n* [[Jodie Foster]] as Iris\n* [[Albert Brooks]] as Tom\n* [[Harvey Keitel]] as Sport\n* [[Leonard Harris (actor)|Leonard Harris]] as Charles Palantine\n* [[Peter Boyle]] as Wizard\n* [[Cybill Shepherd]] as Betsy\n* [[Diahnne Abbott]] as Concession Girl\n* Frank Adu as Angry Black Man\n* [[Victor Argo|Vic Argo]] as Melio\n* Gino Ardito as Policeman At Rally\n* Garth Avery as Iris' Friend\n* Harry Cohn as Cabbie In Bellmore\n* Copper Cunningham as Hooker In Cab\n* [[Brenda Dickson]] as Soap Opera Woman\n* Harry Fischler as Dispatcher\n* Nat Grant as Stick-up Man\n* Richard Higgs as Tall Secret Service Man\n* Beau Kayser as Soap Opera Man\n* Victor Magnotta as Secret Service Photographer\n* Robert Maroff as Mafioso\n* Norman Matlock as Charlie T.\n* [[Senator Bobby|Bill Minkin]] as Tom's assistant\n* Murray Moston as Iris' Time Keeper\n* [[Harry Northup]] as Doughboy\n* Gene Palma as Street Drummer\n* Carey Poe as Campaign Worker\n* [[American Boy: A Profile of Steven Prince|Steven Prince]] as Andy, Gun Salesman\n* Peter Savage as The John\n* [[Martin Scorsese]] as Passenger Watching Silhouette\n* Robert Shields as Palantine Aide\n* Ralph Singleton as T.V.

In ''Scorsese on Scorsese'', Scorsese says ''Taxi Driver'' arose from his feeling that movies are like dreams or drug-induced reveries. He attempted to incubate within the viewer the feeling of being in a limbo state between sleeping and waking. He calls Travis an \"avenging angel\" floating through the streets of a New York City intended to represent all cities everywhere. Scorsese calls attention to improvisation in the film, such as in the scene between De Niro and Cybill Shepherd in the coffee shop. The director also cites [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[The Wrong Man]]'' and Jack Hazan's ''[[A Bigger Splash (1974 film)|A Bigger Splash]]'' as inspirations for his camerawork in the movie.<ref name=\"Ian Christie 1989\">\"Scorsese on Scorsese\" edited by David Thompson and Ian Christie. 057114103X: series London; Boston: Faber and Faber, 1989. Call#: Van Pelt Library PN1998.3.S39 A3 1989</ref>\n\nIn writing the script, Schrader was inspired by the diaries of [[Arthur Bremer]] (who shot presidential candidate [[George Wallace]] in 1972), by Jean-Paul Sartre's existential novel ''Nausea'' and John Ford's film ''The Searchers''.<ref name=\"Rausch\" /> The writer also used himself as inspiration; in a 1981 interview with Tom Snyder on the \"Tomorrow\" show, Schrader related his experience living in New York City while battling chronic insomnia, which led him to frequent pornographic bookstores and theaters because they remained open all night. Following a divorce and a breakup with a live-in girlfriend, he spent a few weeks living in his car. After visiting a hospital for a [[stomach ulcer]], Schrader wrote the screenplay for ''Taxi Driver'' in \"under a fortnight,\" recalling that \"When I was talking to the nurse, I realised I hadn't spoken to anyone in weeks ... that was when the metaphor of the taxi occurred to me. That is what I was: this person in an iron box, a coffin, floating round the city, but seemingly alone.\" Schrader decided to make Bickle a Vietnam vet because the [[national trauma]] of the war seemed to blend perfectly with Bickle's paranoid psychosis, making his experiences after the war more intense and threatening.<ref>\"Travis gave punks a hair of aggression.\" ''Toronto Star'' February 12, 2005: H02</ref>\n\n=== Symbolism ===\nIn ''Scorsese on Scorsese'', Scorsese mentions the religious [[Iconography|symbolism]] in the story, comparing Bickle to a saint who wants to cleanse or purge both his mind and his body of weakness. Bickle attempts to kill himself near the end of the movie as a tribute to the [[samurai]]'s \"[[Seppuku|death with honor]]\" principle.<ref name=\"Ian Christie 1989\" />\n\nWhen Travis meets Betsy to join him for coffee and pie, she is reminded of a line in [[Kris Kristofferson]]'s song [[The Silver Tongued Devil and I|\"The Pilgrim, Chapter 33\"]]: \"He's a prophet and a pusher, partly truth, partly fiction\u2014a walking contradiction.\" On their date, Bickle takes her to see a Swedish \"sex education\" film, which is in fact the American sexploitation film ''Sexual Freedom in Denmark'' with added Swedish sound.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bj\u00f6rklund |first=Elisabet |year=2011 |title='This is a dirty movie' \u2013 Taxi Driver and 'Swedish sin' |journal=Journal of Scandinavian Cinema |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=169\u2013170 |doi=10.1386/jsca.1.2.163_1}}</ref>\n\n''Taxi Driver'' was shot during a New York City summer [[heat wave]] and [[sanitation]] [[Work stoppage|strike]] in 1975.  The film came into conflict with the [[MPAA]] for its violence. Scorsese de-saturated the color in the final shootout, and the film got an R rating. To achieve the atmospheric scenes in Bickle's taxi, the sound men would get in the trunk and Scorsese and his cinematographer, [[Michael Chapman (cinematographer)|Michael Chapman]], would ensconce themselves on the back seat floor and use available light to shoot. Chapman admitted the filming style was greatly influenced by [[French New Wave|New Wave]] filmmaker [[Jean-Luc Godard]] and his cinematographer [[Raoul Coutard]] due to the fact the crew did not have the time nor the money to do \"traditional things.\" <ref>Kilday, Gregg (April 7, 2016). \"''Taxi Driver'' Oral History: De Niro, Scorsese, Foster, Schrader Spill All on 40th Anniversary\". ''The Hollywood Reporter''. Retrieved August 15, 2016.</ref>\n\nWhen Bickle decides to assassinate Senator Palantine, he cuts his hair into a [[Mohawk hairstyle|Mohawk]]. This detail was suggested by actor Victor Magnotta, a friend of Scorsese, who had a small role as a [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent and who had served in Vietnam. Scorsese later noted: \"He told us that, in Saigon, if you saw a guy with his head shaved\u2014like a little Mohawk\u2014that usually meant that those people were ready to go into a certain Special Forces situation. You didn't even go near them. They were ready to kill.\"<ref name=\"Rausch\">{{cite book |last=Rausch |first=Andrew J. |title=The Films of Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro |location= |publisher=Scarecrow Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-8108-7413-8}}</ref>\n\n=== De Niro's preparation for the role ===\nWhile preparing for his role as Bickle, De Niro was filming [[Bernardo Bertolucci]]'s ''[[1900 (film)|1900]]'' in Italy. According to Boyle, he would \"finish shooting on a Friday in Rome ... get on a plane ... [and] fly to New York.\" De Niro obtained a taxi driver's license, and when on break would pick up a taxi and drive around New York for a couple of weeks, before returning to Rome to resume filming ''1900.'' De Niro apparently lost 35 pounds and listened repeatedly to a taped reading of the diaries of [[Arthur Bremer]]. When he had time off from shooting ''1900'', De Niro visited an army base in [[Northern Italy]] and tape-recorded soldiers from the [[Midwestern United States]], whose accents he thought might be appropriate for Travis's character.<ref>Rausch, Andrew J. (2010). ''The Films of Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro''. Scarecrow Press. p. 31. {{ISBN|9780810874145}}.</ref>\n\n=== Pre-production ===\nScorsese brought in the [[film title design]]er [[Dan Perri]] to design the [[title sequence]] for ''Taxi Driver''. Perri had been Scorsese's original choice to design the titles for ''[[Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore]]'' in 1974, but [[Warner Bros]] would not allow him to hire an unknown designer. By the time ''Taxi Driver'' was going into production, Perri had established his reputation with his work on ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', and Scorsese was now able to hire him. Perri created the opening titles for ''Taxi Driver'' using [[Second unit filming|second unit]] footage which he color-treated through a process of film copying and [[slit-scan]], resulting in a highly stylised graphic sequence that evoked the \"underbelly\" of New York City through lurid colors, glowing [[neon sign]]s distorted nocturnal images and deep [[black level]]s. Perri went on to design opening titles for a number of major films after this including ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977) and ''[[Raging Bull]]'' (1980).<ref>Perkins, Will. \"Dan Perri: A Career Retrospective\".

According to producer [[Michael Phillips (producer)|Michael Phillips]], \"the whole West Side was bombed out. There really were row after row of condemned buildings and that's what we used to build our sets, were condemned buildings. Now it's fashionable real estate&nbsp;... But New York and Times Square was shuddering and disgusting. It's just exciting to see the city bounce back and become the great place it is today from where it was then.

Robert Barnett of MusicWeb International has said that it contrasts deep, sleazy noises, representing the \"scum\" that Travis sees all over the city, with the saxophone, a musical counterpart to Travis, creating a mellifluously disenchanted troubadour, played by [[Tom Scott (musician)|Tom Scott]]. Barnett also observes that the opposing noises in the soundtrack\u2014gritty little harp figures, hard as shards of steel, as well as a jazz drum kit placing the drama in the city\u2014are indicative of loneliness in the midst of mobs of people. Deep brass and woodwinds are also evident. Barnett heard in the drumbeat a wild-eyed martial air charting the pressure on Bickle, who is increasingly oppressed by the corruption around him, and that the harp, drum, and saxophone play significant roles in the music.<ref>Taxi Driver: Music composed by Bernard Hermann. musicweb-international.com.

Set in a decaying and morally bankrupt [[New York City]] following the [[Vietnam War]], the film tells the story of [[Travis Bickle]] (De Niro), a lonely taxi driver who descends into insanity as he plots to assassinate both the presidential candidate (Harris) for whom the woman he is infatuated with (Shepherd) works, and the pimp (Keitel) of an [[Child prostitution|underage prostitute]] (Foster) he befriends.\n\nA critical and commercial success upon release and nominated for four [[Academy Awards]], including for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (for De Niro) and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] (for Foster), ''Taxi Driver'' won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1976 Cannes Film Festival]]. The film generated controversy at the time of its release for its depiction of violence and casting of a 12-year-old Foster in the role of a child prostitute.\n\nIn 2012, ''[[Sight & Sound]]'' named it the 31st-best film ever in its decennial [[BFI The Top 50 Greatest Films of All Time|critics' poll]], ranked with ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'', and the fifth-greatest film of all time on its directors' poll. The film was considered \"culturally, historically or aesthetically\" significant by the US [[Library of Congress]] and was selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] in 1994.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1975, [[Travis Bickle]] is a lonely, [[Depression (mood)|depressed]] 26-year-old living in isolation in [[New York City]]. Travis takes a job as a night shift taxi driver to cope with his [[chronic insomnia]], driving passengers around the city's [[New York City borough|boroughs]]. He frequents [[Adult movie theater|porn theaters]] and keeps a diary in which he consciously attempts to include [[aphorisms]], such as \"You're only as healthy as you feel.\"\n\nTravis becomes infatuated with Betsy, a campaign volunteer for Senator and presidential candidate Charles Palantine. After watching her interact with fellow worker Tom through her window, Travis enters to volunteer as a pretext to talk to her, then takes her out for coffee. On a later date, he takes her to see a pornographic film, which offends her, and she goes home alone. His numerous attempts at reconciliation by sending flowers and apologizing over the phone are rebuffed, causing him to become embittered and convinced that she is exactly like the \"cold\" people he detests in the city. He finally confronts her at the campaign office, berating her before being kicked out by Tom.\n\nTravis is disgusted by the sleaze, dysfunction, and prostitution that he witnesses throughout the city, and [[Existential crisis|struggles to find meaning for his existence]]. His worldview is furthered when an adolescent prostitute and runaway, Iris, who uses the professional name \"Easy,\" enters his taxi, attempting to escape her [[pimp]], Sport. Sport drags Iris from the taxi and throws Travis a crumpled $20 bill, which continually reminds Travis of her and the corruption that surrounds him. One evening, an unhinged racist passenger gloats to Travis of his intention to kill his [[Adultery|adulterous]] wife and her black lover. Travis confides in fellow taxi driver Wizard about his thoughts, which are beginning to turn violent; however, Wizard assures him that he will be fine, leaving Travis to his own destructive path.\n\nIn attempting to find an outlet for his frustrations, Travis begins a program of intense physical training. A fellow taxi driver refers him to an illegal gun dealer, \"Easy\" Andy, from whom Travis buys four handguns. At home, Travis practices [[Fast draw|drawing]] his weapons, and builds a rig to allow him to hide and quickly deploy one of his guns from his [[Sleeve gun|sleeve]]. He also begins attending Palantine's rallies to study their security. One night, Travis enters a convenience store seconds before a robber enters and holds the owner at gunpoint, leading Travis to fatally shoot the robber. To help him evade arrest, the store owner, an acquaintance of Travis, takes responsibility for the deed, claiming one of Travis's guns as his own.\n\nTravis seeks out Iris through Sport, and twice tries to convince her to stop prostituting herself, an effort which partially convinces her. After a breakfast with Iris, Travis mails her a letter containing money, imploring her to return home. Travis cuts his hair into a [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawk]] and attends a public rally, where he intends to assassinate Palantine. While attempting to pull out his gun, [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agents notice Travis putting his hand inside his coat and chase him down. Travis, however, successfully escapes the scene.\n\nThat evening, Travis drives to Sport's brothel in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]]. After Sport flicks a cigarette at Travis and derides him outside of the building, he shoots Sport and enters the brothel. Travis shoots the owner's fingers off before being shot in the neck by Sport, whom he fatally shoots in turn. Travis moves upstairs, pursued by the owner, where Iris's client shoots him in the shoulder; Travis kills the made man with the sleeve pistol, stabs the gangster in the hand and fatally shoots him with the made man's [[revolver]] as Iris cries out in terror. He attempts suicide with the revolver, only to find it empty; the police arrive and find a collapsed, bleeding Travis, who looks at them while pantomiming shooting himself before passing out from blood loss.\n\nTravis is not prosecuted, but instead, he is hailed as a local hero in the press, as the criminal dealings of those in the brothel were discovered and publicized. He receives a letter from Iris's father, thanking him for saving her and revealing that she has returned home to [[Pittsburgh]], where she is going to school. After weeks of recovery and returning to work, Travis  encounters Betsy as a fare. Travis drives her home, then refuses to let her pay the fare, driving away with a smile. As Travis drives off, he becomes suddenly agitated after noticing something in his rear-view mirror.\n\n== Cast ==\n<ref name=\"AFI\">{{cite web |url=http://catalog.afi.com/Film/67969-TAXI-DRIVER?sid=b658a8a0-9843-4955-9bd4-560b9f1553aa&sr=4.241532&cp=1&pos=0 |title=Taxi Driver |publisher=[[American Film Institute|AFI]] |accessdate=December 29, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181229172009/http://catalog.afi.com/Film/67969-TAXI-DRIVER?sid=b658a8a0-9843-4955-9bd4-560b9f1553aa&sr=4.241532&cp=1&pos=0|archive-date=December 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"BFI\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b7bc1b8 |title=Taxi Driver (1976) |publisher=[[British Film Institute|BFI]] |accessdate=December 29, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181229171911/https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b7bc1b8|archive-date=December 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as [[Travis Bickle]]\n* [[Jodie Foster]] as Iris\n* [[Albert Brooks]] as Tom\n* [[Harvey Keitel]] as Sport\n* [[Leonard Harris (actor)|Leonard Harris]] as Charles Palantine\n* [[Peter Boyle]] as Wizard\n* [[Cybill Shepherd]] as Betsy\n* [[Diahnne Abbott]] as Concession Girl\n* Frank Adu as Angry Black Man\n* [[Victor Argo|Vic Argo]] as Melio\n* Gino Ardito as Policeman At Rally\n* Garth Avery as Iris' Friend\n* Harry Cohn as Cabbie In Bellmore\n* Copper Cunningham as Hooker In Cab\n* [[Brenda Dickson]] as Soap Opera Woman\n* Harry Fischler as Dispatcher\n* Nat Grant as Stick-up Man\n* Richard Higgs as Tall Secret Service Man\n* Beau Kayser as Soap Opera Man\n* Victor Magnotta as Secret Service Photographer\n* Robert Maroff as Mafioso\n* Norman Matlock as Charlie T.\n* [[Senator Bobby|Bill Minkin]] as Tom's assistant\n* Murray Moston as Iris' Time Keeper\n* [[Harry Northup]] as Doughboy\n* Gene Palma as Street Drummer\n* Carey Poe as Campaign Worker\n* [[American Boy: A Profile of Steven Prince|Steven Prince]] as Andy, Gun Salesman\n* Peter Savage as The John\n* [[Martin Scorsese]] as Passenger Watching Silhouette\n* Robert Shields as Palantine Aide\n* Ralph Singleton as T.V.

In ''Scorsese on Scorsese'', Scorsese says ''Taxi Driver'' arose from his feeling that movies are like dreams or drug-induced reveries. He attempted to incubate within the viewer the feeling of being in a limbo state between sleeping and waking. He calls Travis an \"avenging angel\" floating through the streets of a New York City intended to represent all cities everywhere. Scorsese calls attention to improvisation in the film, such as in the scene between De Niro and Cybill Shepherd in the coffee shop. The director also cites [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[The Wrong Man]]'' and Jack Hazan's ''[[A Bigger Splash (1974 film)|A Bigger Splash]]'' as inspirations for his camerawork in the movie.<ref name=\"Ian Christie 1989\">\"Scorsese on Scorsese\" edited by David Thompson and Ian Christie. 057114103X: series London; Boston: Faber and Faber, 1989. Call#: Van Pelt Library PN1998.3.S39 A3 1989</ref>\n\nIn writing the script, Schrader was inspired by the diaries of [[Arthur Bremer]] (who shot presidential candidate [[George Wallace]] in 1972), by Jean-Paul Sartre's existential novel ''Nausea'' and John Ford's film ''The Searchers''.<ref name=\"Rausch\" /> The writer also used himself as inspiration; in a 1981 interview with Tom Snyder on the \"Tomorrow\" show, Schrader related his experience living in New York City while battling chronic insomnia, which led him to frequent pornographic bookstores and theaters because they remained open all night. Following a divorce and a breakup with a live-in girlfriend, he spent a few weeks living in his car. After visiting a hospital for a [[stomach ulcer]], Schrader wrote the screenplay for ''Taxi Driver'' in \"under a fortnight,\" recalling that \"When I was talking to the nurse, I realised I hadn't spoken to anyone in weeks ... that was when the metaphor of the taxi occurred to me. That is what I was: this person in an iron box, a coffin, floating round the city, but seemingly alone.\" Schrader decided to make Bickle a Vietnam vet because the [[national trauma]] of the war seemed to blend perfectly with Bickle's paranoid psychosis, making his experiences after the war more intense and threatening.<ref>\"Travis gave punks a hair of aggression.\" ''Toronto Star'' February 12, 2005: H02</ref>\n\n=== Symbolism ===\nIn ''Scorsese on Scorsese'', Scorsese mentions the religious [[Iconography|symbolism]] in the story, comparing Bickle to a saint who wants to cleanse or purge both his mind and his body of weakness. Bickle attempts to kill himself near the end of the movie as a tribute to the [[samurai]]'s \"[[Seppuku|death with honor]]\" principle.<ref name=\"Ian Christie 1989\" />\n\nWhen Travis meets Betsy to join him for coffee and pie, she is reminded of a line in [[Kris Kristofferson]]'s song [[The Silver Tongued Devil and I|\"The Pilgrim, Chapter 33\"]]: \"He's a prophet and a pusher, partly truth, partly fiction\u2014a walking contradiction.\" On their date, Bickle takes her to see a Swedish \"sex education\" film, which is in fact the American sexploitation film ''Sexual Freedom in Denmark'' with added Swedish sound.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bj\u00f6rklund |first=Elisabet |year=2011 |title='This is a dirty movie' \u2013 Taxi Driver and 'Swedish sin' |journal=Journal of Scandinavian Cinema |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=169\u2013170 |doi=10.1386/jsca.1.2.163_1}}</ref>\n\n''Taxi Driver'' was shot during a New York City summer [[heat wave]] and [[sanitation]] [[Work stoppage|strike]] in 1975.  The film came into conflict with the [[MPAA]] for its violence. Scorsese de-saturated the color in the final shootout, and the film got an R rating. To achieve the atmospheric scenes in Bickle's taxi, the sound men would get in the trunk and Scorsese and his cinematographer, [[Michael Chapman (cinematographer)|Michael Chapman]], would ensconce themselves on the back seat floor and use available light to shoot. Chapman admitted the filming style was greatly influenced by [[French New Wave|New Wave]] filmmaker [[Jean-Luc Godard]] and his cinematographer [[Raoul Coutard]] due to the fact the crew did not have the time nor the money to do \"traditional things.\" <ref>Kilday, Gregg (April 7, 2016). \"''Taxi Driver'' Oral History: De Niro, Scorsese, Foster, Schrader Spill All on 40th Anniversary\". ''The Hollywood Reporter''. Retrieved August 15, 2016.</ref>\n\nWhen Bickle decides to assassinate Senator Palantine, he cuts his hair into a [[Mohawk hairstyle|Mohawk]]. This detail was suggested by actor Victor Magnotta, a friend of Scorsese, who had a small role as a [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent and who had served in Vietnam. Scorsese later noted: \"He told us that, in Saigon, if you saw a guy with his head shaved\u2014like a little Mohawk\u2014that usually meant that those people were ready to go into a certain Special Forces situation. You didn't even go near them. They were ready to kill.\"<ref name=\"Rausch\">{{cite book |last=Rausch |first=Andrew J. |title=The Films of Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro |location= |publisher=Scarecrow Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-8108-7413-8}}</ref>\n\n=== De Niro's preparation for the role ===\nWhile preparing for his role as Bickle, De Niro was filming [[Bernardo Bertolucci]]'s ''[[1900 (film)|1900]]'' in Italy. According to Boyle, he would \"finish shooting on a Friday in Rome ... get on a plane ... [and] fly to New York.\" De Niro obtained a taxi driver's license, and when on break would pick up a taxi and drive around New York for a couple of weeks, before returning to Rome to resume filming ''1900.'' De Niro apparently lost 35 pounds and listened repeatedly to a taped reading of the diaries of [[Arthur Bremer]]. When he had time off from shooting ''1900'', De Niro visited an army base in [[Northern Italy]] and tape-recorded soldiers from the [[Midwestern United States]], whose accents he thought might be appropriate for Travis's character.<ref>Rausch, Andrew J. (2010). ''The Films of Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro''. Scarecrow Press. p. 31. {{ISBN|9780810874145}}.</ref>\n\n=== Pre-production ===\nScorsese brought in the [[film title design]]er [[Dan Perri]] to design the [[title sequence]] for ''Taxi Driver''. Perri had been Scorsese's original choice to design the titles for ''[[Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore]]'' in 1974, but [[Warner Bros]] would not allow him to hire an unknown designer. By the time ''Taxi Driver'' was going into production, Perri had established his reputation with his work on ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', and Scorsese was now able to hire him. Perri created the opening titles for ''Taxi Driver'' using [[Second unit filming|second unit]] footage which he color-treated through a process of film copying and [[slit-scan]], resulting in a highly stylised graphic sequence that evoked the \"underbelly\" of New York City through lurid colors, glowing [[neon sign]]s distorted nocturnal images and deep [[black level]]s. Perri went on to design opening titles for a number of major films after this including ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977) and ''[[Raging Bull]]'' (1980).<ref>Perkins, Will. \"Dan Perri: A Career Retrospective\".

According to producer [[Michael Phillips (producer)|Michael Phillips]], \"the whole West Side was bombed out. There really were row after row of condemned buildings and that's what we used to build our sets, were condemned buildings. Now it's fashionable real estate&nbsp;... But New York and Times Square was shuddering and disgusting. It's just exciting to see the city bounce back and become the great place it is today from where it was then.

Robert Barnett of MusicWeb International has said that it contrasts deep, sleazy noises, representing the \"scum\" that Travis sees all over the city, with the saxophone, a musical counterpart to Travis, creating a mellifluously disenchanted troubadour, played by [[Tom Scott (musician)|Tom Scott]]. Barnett also observes that the opposing noises in the soundtrack\u2014gritty little harp figures, hard as shards of steel, as well as a jazz drum kit placing the drama in the city\u2014are indicative of loneliness in the midst of mobs of people. Deep brass and woodwinds are also evident. Barnett heard in the drumbeat a wild-eyed martial air charting the pressure on Bickle, who is increasingly oppressed by the corruption around him, and that the harp, drum, and saxophone play significant roles in the music.<ref>Taxi Driver: Music composed by Bernard Hermann. musicweb-international.com.
