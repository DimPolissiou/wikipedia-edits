Captain Man tells Henry not to tell anybody about his job, so he attempts to keep it a secret from his best friends, Charlotte and Jasper, his younger sister, Piper, and his parents. Henry goes to a shop called \"Junk 'n' Stuff\" which has a secret lair called the Man Cave hidden underneath where Captain Man does his work. Captain Man says he will not be around for long and needs help; soon enough, he will need someone to take his place when he is gone.\n\n== Episodes ==\n{{main|List of Henry Danger episodes}}\n{{:List of Henry Danger episodes}}\n\n== Cast ==\n{{main|List of Henry Danger characters}}\n\n* [[Jace Norman]] as Henry Hart / Kid Danger<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.henry-danger-danschneider.com/cast-and-characters/henry-hart-kid-danger|title=Henry Hart - Kid Danger|work=[[DanWarp]]|author=[[Dan Schneider (TV producer)|Dan Schneider]]|access-date=July 21, 2017}}</ref>\n* Cooper Barnes as Ray Manchester / Captain Man<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.henry-danger-danschneider.com/cast-and-characters/ray-manchester-captain-man|title=Ray Manchester - Captain Man|work=[[DanWarp]]|author=[[Dan Schneider (TV producer)|Dan Schneider]]|access-date=July 21, 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Riele Downs]] as Charlotte<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.henry-danger-danschneider.com/cast-and-characters/charlotte|title=Charlotte|work=[[DanWarp]]|author=[[Dan Schneider (TV producer)|Dan Schneider]]|access-date=May 5, 2019}}</ref>\n* Sean Ryan Fox as Jasper Dunlop<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.henry-danger-danschneider.com/cast-and-characters/jasper-dunlop|title=Jasper Dunlop|work=[[DanWarp]]|author=[[Dan Schneider (TV producer)|Dan Schneider]]|access-date=July 21, 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Ella Anderson]] as Piper Hart<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.henry-danger-danschneider.com/cast-and-characters/piper-hart|title=Piper Hart|work=[[DanWarp]]|author=[[Dan Schneider (TV producer)|Dan Schneider]]|access-date=July 21, 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Michael Cohen (actor)|Michael D.

Captain Man tells Henry not to tell anybody about his job, so he attempts to keep it a secret from his best friends, Charlotte and Jasper, his younger sister, Piper, and his parents. Henry goes to a shop called \"Junk 'n' Stuff\" which has a secret lair called the Man Cave hidden underneath where Captain Man does his work. Captain Man says he will not be around for long and needs help; soon enough, he will need someone to take his place when he is gone.\n\n== Episodes ==\n{{main|List of Henry Danger episodes}}\n{{:List of Henry Danger episodes}}\n\n== Cast ==\n{{main|List of Henry Danger characters}}\n\n* [[Jace Norman]] as Henry Hart / Kid Danger<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.henry-danger-danschneider.com/cast-and-characters/henry-hart-kid-danger|title=Henry Hart - Kid Danger|work=[[DanWarp]]|author=[[Dan Schneider (TV producer)|Dan Schneider]]|access-date=July 21, 2017}}</ref>\n* Cooper Barnes as Ray Manchester / Captain Man<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.henry-danger-danschneider.com/cast-and-characters/ray-manchester-captain-man|title=Ray Manchester - Captain Man|work=[[DanWarp]]|author=[[Dan Schneider (TV producer)|Dan Schneider]]|access-date=July 21, 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Riele Downs]] as Charlotte<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.henry-danger-danschneider.com/cast-and-characters/charlotte|title=Charlotte|work=[[DanWarp]]|author=[[Dan Schneider (TV producer)|Dan Schneider]]|access-date=May 5, 2019}}</ref>\n* Sean Ryan Fox as Jasper Dunlop<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.henry-danger-danschneider.com/cast-and-characters/jasper-dunlop|title=Jasper Dunlop|work=[[DanWarp]]|author=[[Dan Schneider (TV producer)|Dan Schneider]]|access-date=July 21, 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Ella Anderson]] as Piper Hart<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.henry-danger-danschneider.com/cast-and-characters/piper-hart|title=Piper Hart|work=[[DanWarp]]|author=[[Dan Schneider (TV producer)|Dan Schneider]]|access-date=July 21, 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Michael Cohen (actor)|Michael D.

She came from the [[Beecher family]], a famous religious family, and is best known for her novel ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1852), which depicts the harsh conditions for enslaved African Americans. The book reached millions as a novel and play, and became influential in the United States and Great Britain, energizing anti-slavery forces in the [[Northern United States|American North]], while provoking widespread anger in the [[Southern United States|South]]. Stowe wrote 30 books, including novels, three travel memoirs, and collections of articles and letters. She was influential for both her writings and her public stances and debates on social issues of the day.\n\n==Life and work==\nHarriet Elisabeth Beecher was born in [[Litchfield, Connecticut]], on June 14, 1811.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">McFarland, Philip.

Her mother was his first wife, Roxana (Foote), a deeply religious woman who died when Stowe was only five years old. Roxana's maternal grandfather was General Andrew Ward of the Revolutionary War. Her notable siblings included a sister, [[Catharine Beecher]], who became an educator and author, as well as brothers who became ministers: including [[Henry Ward Beecher]], who became a famous preacher and abolitionist, [[Charles Beecher]], and [[Edward Beecher]].<ref>Applegate, Debby (2006).

There she received something girls seldom got, a traditional academic education, with a focus in the [[Classics]], languages, and mathematics. Among her classmates was Sarah P. Willis, who later wrote under the pseudonym [[Fanny Fern]].<ref>Warren, Joyce W. ''Fanny Fern: An Independent Woman''.

There, she also joined the [[Semi-Colon Club]], a literary salon and social club whose members included the Beecher sisters, [[Caroline Lee Hentz]], [[Salmon P. Chase]] (future governor of Ohio and [[Secretary of the Treasury]] under President Lincoln), [[Emily Blackwell]] and others.<ref name=\"tonk\">Tonkovic, Nicole.

[[Cincinnati riots of 1829|In 1829 the ethnic Irish attacked blacks]], wrecking areas of the city, trying to push out these competitors for jobs. Beecher met a number of African Americans who had suffered in those attacks, and their experience contributed to her later writing about slavery. Riots took place again [[Cincinnati riots of 1836|in 1836]] and [[Cincinnati riots of 1841|1841]], driven also by native-born anti-abolitionists.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nHarriet was also influenced by the [[Lane Debates on Slavery]]. The biggest event ever to take place at Lane, it was the series of debates held on 18 days in February 1834, between [[American Colonization Society|colonization]] and abolition defenders, decisively won by [[Theodore Weld]] and other abolitionists. Elisabeth attended most of the debates.<ref name=Williams>{{cite book\n|title=Prudence Crandall's legacy : the fight for equality in the 1830s, Dred Scott, and Brown v.

Stowe showed that slavery touched all of society, beyond the people directly involved as masters, traders and slaves. Her novel added to the debate about abolition and slavery, and aroused opposition in the South. In the South, Stowe was depicted as out of touch, arrogant, and guilty of slander. Within a year, 300 babies in Boston alone were named [[Uncle Tom's Cabin#Eva|Eva (one of the book's characters)]], and a play based on the book opened in New York in November.<ref>Morgan, Jo-Ann.

By 1888, the ''[[Washington Post]]'' reported that as a result of dementia the 77-year-old Stowe started writing ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' over again. She imagined that she was engaged in the original composition, and for several hours every day she industriously used pen and paper, inscribing passages of the book almost exactly word for word. This was done unconsciously from memory, the authoress imagining that she composed the matter as she went along. To her diseased mind the story was brand new, and she frequently exhausted herself with labor which she regarded as freshly created.<ref>[http://utc.iath.virginia.edu/articles/n2ar19cmt.html \"Rewriting Uncle Tom\"] Retrieved September 6, 2013.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Mark Twain]], a neighbor of Stowe's in Hartford, recalled her last years in the following passage of his autobiography:\n\n<blockquote>Her mind had decayed, and she was a pathetic figure.  She wandered about all the day long in the care of a muscular Irish woman.  Among the colonists of our neighborhood the doors always stood open in pleasant weather.  Mrs. Stowe entered them at her own free will, and as she was always softly slippered and generally full of animal spirits, she was able to deal in surprises, and she liked to do it.  She would slip up behind a person who was deep in dreams and musings and fetch a war whoop that would jump that person out of his clothes.  And she had other moods.  Sometimes we would hear gentle music in the drawing-room and would find her there at the piano singing ancient and melancholy songs with infinitely touching effect.<ref>{{cite book |title=Autobiography of Mark Twain: Volume 1 |editor-last=Smith |editor-first=Harriet Elinor |year=2010 |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |pages=[https://archive.org/details/autobiographyofm00twai_0/page/438 438\u201339] |isbn=978-0-520-26719-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/autobiographyofm00twai_0/page/438 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nModern researchers now speculate that at the end of her life Harriet was suffering from [[Alzheimer's disease]].{{sfn|Hedrick|1994|p=384}}\n\nHarriet Beecher Stowe died on July 1, 1896, in [[Hartford]], [[Connecticut]], 17 days after her 85th birthday.\nShe is buried in the historic cemetery at [[Phillips Academy]] in [[Andover, Massachusetts]],<ref>Wilson, Scott.

Stowe wrote ''[[Palmetto Leaves]]'' while living in Mandarin, arguably an eloquent piece of promotional literature directed at Florida's potential Northern investors at the time.<ref>Thulesius, Olav. ''Harriet Beecher Stowe in Florida, 1867 to 1884'', Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland & Co, 2001</ref> The book was published in 1873 and describes Northeast Florida and its residents. In 1874, Stowe was honored by the governor of Florida as one of several northerners who had helped Florida's growth after the war. In addition to her writings inspiring tourists and settlers to the area, she helped establish a church and a school, and she helped promote oranges as a major state crop through her own orchards.<ref>Koester, Nancy.

Her husband was teaching theology at nearby [[Bowdoin College]], and she regularly invited students from the college and friends to read and discuss the chapters before publication. Future [[American Civil War|Civil War]] general, and later Governor, [[Joshua Chamberlain]] was then a student at the college and later described the setting. \"On these occasions,\" Chamberlain noted, \"a chosen circle of friends, mostly young, were favored with the freedom of her house, the rallying point being, however, the reading before publication, of the successive chapters of her Uncle Tom's Cabin, and the frank discussion of them.\"{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} In 2001 [[Bowdoin College]] purchased the house, together with a newer attached building, and was able to raise the substantial funds necessary to restore the house.

To avoid illness, Stowe made a visit to [[Washington, Kentucky]], a major community of the era just south of [[Maysville, Kentucky|Maysville]]. She stayed with the Marshall Key family, one of whose daughters was a student at Lane Seminary. It is recorded that Mr. Key took her to see a slave auction, as they were frequently held in Maysville.

She came from the [[Beecher family]], a famous religious family, and is best known for her novel ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1852), which depicts the harsh conditions for enslaved African Americans. The book reached millions as a novel and play, and became influential in the United States and Great Britain, energizing anti-slavery forces in the [[Northern United States|American North]], while provoking widespread anger in the [[Southern United States|South]]. Stowe wrote 30 books, including novels, three travel memoirs, and collections of articles and letters. She was influential for both her writings and her public stances and debates on social issues of the day.\n\n==Life and work==\nHarriet Elisabeth Beecher was born in [[Litchfield, Connecticut]], on June 14, 1811.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">McFarland, Philip.

Her mother was his first wife, Roxana (Foote), a deeply religious woman who died when Stowe was only five years old. Roxana's maternal grandfather was General Andrew Ward of the Revolutionary War. Her notable siblings included a sister, [[Catharine Beecher]], who became an educator and author, as well as brothers who became ministers: including [[Henry Ward Beecher]], who became a famous preacher and abolitionist, [[Charles Beecher]], and [[Edward Beecher]].<ref>Applegate, Debby (2006).

[[Cincinnati riots of 1829|In 1829 the ethnic Irish attacked blacks]], wrecking areas of the city, trying to push out these competitors for jobs.

The biggest event ever to take place at Lane, it was the series of debates held on 18 days in February 1834, between [[American Colonization Society|colonization]] and abolition defenders, decisively won by [[Theodore Weld]] and other abolitionists.

Lincoln, the goal of the book was to educate Northerners on the realistic horrors of the things that were happening in the South. The other purpose was to try to make people in the South feel more empathetic towards the people they were forcing into slavery.<ref>Vollaro, Daniel R. \u201cLincoln, Stowe, And The Little Woman/Great War' Story: The Making, And Breaking, Of A Great American Anecdote\u201d.

Stowe showed that slavery touched all of society, beyond the people directly involved as masters, traders and slaves. Her novel added to the debate about abolition and slavery, and aroused opposition in the South. In the South, Stowe was depicted as out of touch, arrogant, and guilty of slander. Within a year, 300 babies in Boston alone were named [[Uncle Tom's Cabin#Eva|Eva (one of the book's characters)]], and a play based on the book opened in New York in November.<ref>Morgan, Jo-Ann.

Many of these were bestsellers, although none matched the popularity of Stowe's work, which set publishing records.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nAfter the start of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Stowe traveled to the capital, Washington, D.C., where she met President [[Abraham Lincoln]] on November 25, 1862.<ref>McFarland, Philip.

In response to a newspaper article in 1873 she wrote, \"I came to Florida the year after the war and held property in [[Duval County, Florida|Duval County]] ever since.

The newly homeless moved to Canada, where very bitter accounts appeared. It was Stowe's assignment to refute them using evidence the Duchess provided, in Letter XVII Volume 1 of her travel memoir ''Sunny Memories of Foreign Lands''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Harriet Beecher Stowe|title=Sunny memories of foreign lands|publisher=Phillips, Sampson, and Company|url=https://archive.org/details/sunnymemoriesoff01stow_0|year=1854|pages=[https://archive.org/details/sunnymemoriesoff01stow_0/page/301 301]\u201313}}</ref> Stowe was vulnerable when she seemed to defend the cruelties in Scotland as eagerly as she attacked the cruelties in the American South.<ref>For a hostile account see Judie Newman, \"Stowe's sunny memories of Highland slavery.\" in {{cite book|author=Janet Beer and Bridget Bennett eds. |title=Special Relationships: Anglo-American Affinities and Antagonisms 1854\u20131936|url=http://www.oapen.org/download?type=document&collection=oapen&docid=341374#page=28|year=2002|publisher=Manchester University Press|pages=28\u201341}}</ref>\n\nIn 1868, Stowe became one of the first editors of ''[[Hearth and Home]]'' magazine, one of several new publications appealing to women; she departed after a year.<ref name=\"mott\">Mott, Frank Luther.

By 1888, the ''[[Washington Post]]'' reported that as a result of dementia the 77-year-old Stowe started writing ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' over again. She imagined that she was engaged in the original composition, and for several hours every day she industriously used pen and paper, inscribing passages of the book almost exactly word for word. This was done unconsciously from memory, the authoress imagining that she composed the matter as she went along. To her diseased mind the story was brand new, and she frequently exhausted herself with labor which she regarded as freshly created.<ref>[http://utc.iath.virginia.edu/articles/n2ar19cmt.html \"Rewriting Uncle Tom\"] Retrieved September 6, 2013.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Mark Twain]], a neighbor of Stowe's in Hartford, recalled her last years in the following passage of his autobiography:\n\n<blockquote>Her mind had decayed, and she was a pathetic figure.  She wandered about all the day long in the care of a muscular Irish woman.  Among the colonists of our neighborhood the doors always stood open in pleasant weather.  Mrs. Stowe entered them at her own free will, and as she was always softly slippered and generally full of animal spirits, she was able to deal in surprises, and she liked to do it.  She would slip up behind a person who was deep in dreams and musings and fetch a war whoop that would jump that person out of his clothes.  And she had other moods.  Sometimes we would hear gentle music in the drawing-room and would find her there at the piano singing ancient and melancholy songs with infinitely touching effect.<ref>{{cite book |title=Autobiography of Mark Twain: Volume 1 |editor-last=Smith |editor-first=Harriet Elinor |year=2010 |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |pages=[https://archive.org/details/autobiographyofm00twai_0/page/438 438\u201339] |isbn=978-0-520-26719-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/autobiographyofm00twai_0/page/438 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nModern researchers now speculate that at the end of her life Harriet was suffering from [[Alzheimer's disease]].{{sfn|Hedrick|1994|p=384}}\n\nHarriet Beecher Stowe died on July 1, 1896, in [[Hartford]], [[Connecticut]], 17 days after her 85th birthday.\nShe is buried in the historic cemetery at [[Phillips Academy]] in [[Andover, Massachusetts]],<ref>Wilson, Scott.

The locations of these landmarks represent various periods of her life such as her father's house where she grew up, and where she wrote her most famous work.\n\nThe [[Harriet Beecher Stowe House (Cincinnati, Ohio)|Harriet Beecher Stowe House]] in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], is the former home of her father Lyman Beecher on the former campus of the Lane Seminary. Her father was a preacher who was greatly affected by the pro-slavery [[Cincinnati Riots of 1836]]. Harriet Beecher Stowe lived here until her marriage. It is open to the public and operated as a historical and cultural site, focusing on Harriet Beecher Stowe, the Lane Seminary and the Underground Railroad.

Stowe wrote ''[[Palmetto Leaves]]'' while living in Mandarin, arguably an eloquent piece of promotional literature directed at Florida's potential Northern investors at the time.<ref>Thulesius, Olav. ''Harriet Beecher Stowe in Florida, 1867 to 1884'', Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland & Co, 2001</ref> The book was published in 1873 and describes Northeast Florida and its residents. In 1874, Stowe was honored by the governor of Florida as one of several northerners who had helped Florida's growth after the war. In addition to her writings inspiring tourists and settlers to the area, she helped establish a church and a school, and she helped promote oranges as a major state crop through her own orchards.<ref>Koester, Nancy.

This predated the national movement toward integration by more than a half century. The marker commemorating the Stowe family is located across the street from the former site of their cottage. It is on the property of the Community Club, at the site of a church where Stowe's husband once served as a minister. The [[Church of Our Saviour (Jacksonville, Florida)|Church of our Saviour]] is an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] founded in 1880 by a group of people who had gathered for Bible readings with Professor Calvin E.

Her husband was teaching theology at nearby [[Bowdoin College]], and she regularly invited students from the college and friends to read and discuss the chapters before publication. Future [[American Civil War|Civil War]] general, and later Governor, [[Joshua Chamberlain]] was then a student at the college and later described the setting. \"On these occasions,\" Chamberlain noted, \"a chosen circle of friends, mostly young, were favored with the freedom of her house, the rallying point being, however, the reading before publication, of the successive chapters of her Uncle Tom's Cabin, and the frank discussion of them.\"{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} In 2001 [[Bowdoin College]] purchased the house, together with a newer attached building, and was able to raise the substantial funds necessary to restore the house. It is now open to the public.\n\nThe [[Harriet Beecher Stowe House (Connecticut)|Harriet Beecher Stowe House]] in [[Hartford]], [[Connecticut]], is the house where Stowe lived for the last 23 years of her life. It was next door to the house of fellow author [[Mark Twain]]. In this {{convert|5000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} cottage-style house, there are many of Beecher Stowe's original items and items from the time period.

To avoid illness, Stowe made a visit to [[Washington, Kentucky]], a major community of the era just south of [[Maysville, Kentucky|Maysville]]. She stayed with the Marshall Key family, one of whose daughters was a student at Lane Seminary. It is recorded that Mr. Key took her to see a slave auction, as they were frequently held in Maysville. Scholars believe she was strongly moved by the experience. The Marshall Key home still stands in Washington. Key was a prominent Kentuckian; his visitors also included [[Henry Clay]] and [[Daniel Webster]].<ref>Calvert and Klee, ''Towns of Mason County [KY]'', {{LCCN|8662637}}{{dead link|date=June 2019}}, 1986, Maysville and Mason County Library, Historical, and Scientific Association.</ref>\n\nThe Uncle Tom's Cabin Historic Site is part of the restored Dawn Settlement at [[Dresden, Ontario]], which is 20 miles east of [[Algonac, Michigan]].

However, this scenario can be resolved within the standard framework of special relativity: the travelling twin's trajectory involves two different [[Inertial frame of reference|inertial frames]], one for the outbound journey and one for the inbound journey, and so there is no symmetry between the spacetime paths of the twins. Therefore, the twin paradox is not a [[paradox]] in the sense of a logical contradiction. \n\nStarting with [[Paul Langevin]] in 1911, there have been various explanations of this paradox.

The traveler remains in a projectile for one year of his time, and then reverses direction. Upon return, the traveler will find that he has aged two years, while 200 years have passed on Earth. During the trip, both the traveler and Earth keep sending signals to each other at a constant rate, which places Langevin's story among the Doppler shift versions of the twin paradox.

The traveling twin transfers his clock reading to a third one, traveling in the opposite direction. Another way of avoiding acceleration effects is the use of the relativistic Doppler effect (see [[#What_it_looks_like:_the_relativistic_Doppler_shift|What it looks like: the relativistic Doppler shift]] below).\n\nNeither Einstein nor Langevin considered such results to be problematic: Einstein only called it \"peculiar\" while Langevin presented it as a consequence of absolute acceleration.<ref group=A>\"We are going to see this absolute character of the acceleration manifest itself in another form.\" (\"Nous allons voir se manifester sous une autre forme ce caract\u00e8re absolu de l'acc\u00e9l\u00e9ration.\"), page 82 of Langevin1911</ref> Both men argued that, from the time differential illustrated by the story of the twins, no self-contradiction could be constructed.

Similarly, at the end of the outgoing trip, the change in direction needed to start the return trip is assumed to occur in a negligible time. \n\nThe parties will observe the situation as follows:<ref>{{cite book\n|title=Textbook Of Engineering Physics, Part I\n|first1=Mahesh C.\n|last1=Jain\n|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt\n|year=2009\n|isbn=8120338626\n|page=74\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DqZlU3RJTywC&pg=PA74}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=DqZlU3RJTywC&pg=PA74 Extract of page 74]\n</ref><ref>{{cite book\n|title=Introduction to Relativity\n|first1=P.

The amount of time as measured on the ship's clocks and the aging of the travelers during their trip will be reduced by the factor <math>\\varepsilon = \\scriptstyle{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}</math>, the reciprocal of the [[Lorentz factor]] ([[time dilation]]). In this case {{nowrap|''\u03b5'' {{=}} 0.6}} and the travelers will have aged only {{nowrap|0.6 \u00d7 10 {{=}} 6 years}} when they return.\n\n=== Travellers' perspective ===\nThe ship's crew members also calculate the particulars of their trip from their perspective. They know that the distant star system and the Earth are moving relative to the ship at speed ''v'' during the trip. In their rest frame the distance between the Earth and the star system is {{nowrap|''\u03b5d'' {{=}} 0.6 \u00d7 4 {{=}} 2.4 light}} years ([[length contraction]]), for both the outward and return journeys. Each half of the journey takes {{nowrap|''\u03b5d'' / ''v'' {{=}} 2.4 / 0.8 {{=}} 3 years}}, and the round trip takes twice as long (6 years). Their calculations show that they will arrive home having aged 6&nbsp;years. The travelers' final calculation about their aging is in complete agreement with the calculations of those on Earth, though they experience the trip quite differently from those who stay at home.\n\n=== Conclusion ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Readings on Earth's and spaceship's clocks\n!

If twins are born on the day the ship leaves, and one goes on the journey while the other stays on Earth, they will meet again when the traveler is 6&nbsp;years old and the stay-at-home twin is 10&nbsp;years old.\n\n==Resolution of the paradox in special relativity==\n\nThe paradoxical aspect of the twins' situation arises from the fact that at any given moment the travelling twin's clock is running slow in the earthbound twin's inertial frame, but based on the relativity principle one could equally argue that the earthbound twin's clock is running slow in the travelling twin's inertial frame.<ref name='Ohanian'>{{cite book|last=Ohanian|first=Hans|title=Special relativity: a modern introduction|date=2001|publisher=Physics Curriculum and Instruction|location=Lakeville, MN|isbn=0971313415}}</ref><ref name='Harris'>{{cite book|last=Harris|first=Randy|title=Modern Physics|date=2008|publisher=Pearson Addison-Wesley|location=San Francisco, CA|isbn=0805303081}}</ref><ref name='Rindler'>{{cite book|last=Rindler|first=W|title=Introduction to special relativity|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=9780198567318}}</ref> One proposed resolution is based on the fact that the earthbound twin is at rest in the same inertial frame throughout the journey, while the travelling twin is not: in the simplest version of the thought-experiment, the travelling twin switches at the midpoint of the trip from being at rest in an inertial frame which moves in one direction (away from the Earth) to being at rest in an inertial frame which moves in the opposite direction (towards the Earth). In this approach, determining which observer switches frames and which does not is crucial. Although both twins can legitimately claim that they are at rest in their own frame, only the traveling twin experiences acceleration when the spaceship engines are turned on. This acceleration, measurable with an accelerometer, makes his rest frame temporarily non-inertial. This reveals a crucial asymmetry between the twins's perspectives: although we can predict the aging difference from both perspectives, we need to use different methods to obtain correct results.\n\n===Role of acceleration===\nAlthough some solutions attribute a crucial role to the acceleration of the travelling twin at the time of the turnaround,<ref name='Ohanian'/><ref name='Harris'/><ref name='Rindler'/><ref name='Weidner'>{{cite book|last=Weidner|first=Richard|title=Physics|url=https://archive.org/details/physics0000weid|url-access=registration|date=1985|publisher=Allyn and Bacon|location=Needham Heights, MA|isbn=0205111556}}</ref> others note that the effect also arises if one imagines two separate travellers, one outward-going and one inward-coming, who pass each other and synchronize their clocks at the point corresponding to \"turnaround\" of a single traveller.

There is a difference between the trajectories of the twins: the trajectory of the ship is equally divided between two different inertial frames, while the Earth-based twin stays in the same inertial frame.]]\nFor a moment-by-moment understanding of how the time difference between the twins unfolds, one must understand that in special relativity there is no concept of ''absolute present''. For different inertial frames there are different sets of events that are simultaneous in that frame. This [[relativity of simultaneity]] means that switching from one inertial frame to another requires an adjustment in what slice through spacetime counts as the \"present\". In the spacetime diagram on the right, drawn for the reference frame of the Earth-based twin, that twin's world line coincides with the vertical axis (his position is constant in space, moving only in time). On the first leg of the trip, the second twin moves to the right (black sloped line); and on the second leg, back to the left. Blue lines show the ''planes of simultaneity'' for the traveling twin during the first leg of the journey; red lines, during the second leg. Just before turnaround, the traveling twin calculates the age of the Earth-based twin by measuring the interval along the vertical axis from the origin to the upper blue line. Just after turnaround, if he recalculates, he will measure the interval from the origin to the lower red line. In a sense, during the U-turn the plane of simultaneity jumps from blue to red and very quickly sweeps over a large segment of the world line of the Earth-based twin.

Also, according to the so-called \"clock postulate\", physical acceleration of clocks doesn't contribute to the [[kinematical]] effects of special relativity. Rather, the time differential between two reunited clocks is produced purely by uniform [[inertial motion]], as discussed in Einstein's original 1905 relativity paper,<ref name=\"Einstein, A. 1923 pp. 38\"/> as well as in all subsequent kinematical derivations of the Lorentz transformations.\n\nBecause spacetime diagrams incorporate Einstein's clock synchronization (with its lattice of clocks methodology), there will be a requisite jump in the reading of the Earth clock time made by a \"suddenly returning astronaut\" who inherits a \"new meaning of simultaneity\" in keeping with a new clock synchronization dictated by the transfer to a different inertial frame, as explained in Spacetime Physics by John A. Wheeler.<ref name=\"Wheeler, J. 1992 pp. 38, 170\"/>\n\nIf, instead of incorporating Einstein's clock synchronization (lattice of clocks), the astronaut (outgoing and incoming) and the Earth-based party regularly update each other on the status of their clocks by way of sending radio signals (which travel at light speed), then all parties will note an incremental buildup of asymmetry in time-keeping, beginning at the \"turn around\" point. Prior to the \"turn around\", each party regards the other party's clock to be recording time differently from his own, but the noted difference is symmetrical between the two parties. After the \"turn around\", the noted differences are not symmetrical, and the asymmetry grows incrementally until the two parties are reunited. Upon finally reuniting, this asymmetry can be seen in the actual difference showing on the two reunited clocks.<ref>William Geraint Vaughan Rosser (1991).

Or, if each twin always carried a clock indicating his age, what time would each see in the image of their distant twin and his clock?\n\nShortly after departure, the traveling twin sees the stay-at-home twin with no time delay. At arrival, the image in the ship screen shows the staying twin as he was 1&nbsp;year after launch, because radio emitted from Earth 1&nbsp;year after launch gets to the other star 4&nbsp;years afterwards and meets the ship there. During this leg of the trip, the traveling twin sees his own clock advance 3&nbsp;years and the clock in the screen advance 1&nbsp;year, so it seems to advance at {{frac|3}} the normal rate, just 20&nbsp;image seconds per ship minute. This combines the effects of time dilation due to motion (by factor \u03b5=0.6, five years on earth are 3&nbsp;years on ship) and the effect of increasing light-time-delay (which grows from 0 to 4&nbsp;years).\n\nOf course, the observed frequency of the transmission is also {{frac|3}} the frequency of the transmitter (a reduction in frequency; \"red-shifted\"). This is called the [[relativistic Doppler effect]]. The frequency of clock-ticks (or of wavefronts) which one sees from a source with rest frequency ''f''<sub>rest</sub> is\n:<math>f_\\mathrm{obs} = f_\\mathrm{rest}\\sqrt{\\left({1 - v/c}\\right)/\\left({1 + v/c}\\right)}</math>\nwhen the source is moving directly away. This is ''f''<sub>obs</sub> = {{frac|3}}''f''<sub>rest</sub> for ''v''/''c'' = 0.8.\n\nAs for the stay-at-home twin, he gets a slowed signal from the ship for 9&nbsp;years, at a frequency {{frac|3}} the transmitter frequency. During these 9&nbsp;years, the clock of the traveling twin in the screen seems to advance 3&nbsp;years, so both twins see the image of their sibling aging at a rate only {{frac|3}} their own rate. Expressed in other way, they would both see the other's clock run at {{frac|3}} their own clock speed. If they factor out of the calculation the fact that the light-time delay of the transmission is increasing at a rate of 0.8&nbsp;seconds per second, ''both'' can work out that the other twin is aging slower, at 60% rate.\n\nThen the ship turns back toward home. The clock of the staying twin shows \"1&nbsp;year after launch\" in the screen of the ship, and during the 3&nbsp;years of the trip back it increases up to \"10&nbsp;years after launch\", so the clock in the screen seems to be advancing 3&nbsp;times faster than usual.\n\nWhen the source is moving towards the observer, the observed frequency is higher (\"blue-shifted\") and given by\n:<math>f_\\mathrm{obs} = f_\\mathrm{rest}\\sqrt{\\left({1 + v/c}\\right)/\\left({1 - v/c}\\right)}</math>\nThis is ''f''<sub>obs</sub> = 3''f''<sub>rest</sub> for ''v''/''c'' = 0.8.\n\nAs for the screen on Earth, it shows that trip back beginning 9&nbsp;years after launch, and the traveling clock in the screen shows that 3&nbsp;years have passed on the ship. One year later, the ship is back home and the clock shows 6&nbsp;years. So, during the trip back, ''both'' twins see their sibling's clock going 3&nbsp;times faster than their own. Factoring out the fact that the light-time-delay is decreasing by 0.8&nbsp;seconds every second, each twin calculates that the other twin is aging at 60% his own aging speed.\n\n[[Image:rstd4.gif|thumb|left|Light paths for images exchanged during trip<br>Left: Earth to ship. Right: Ship to Earth.<br>\nRed lines indicate low frequency images are received, blue lines indicate high frequency images are received]]\nThe ''x''\u2013''t'' (space\u2013time) diagrams at left show the paths of light signals traveling between Earth and ship (1st diagram) and between ship and Earth (2nd diagram). These signals carry the images of each twin and his age-clock to the other twin. The vertical black line is the Earth's path through spacetime and the other two sides of the triangle show the ship's path through spacetime (as in the Minkowski diagram above). As far as the sender is concerned, he transmits these at equal intervals (say, once an hour) according to his own clock; but according to the clock of the twin receiving these signals, they are not being received at equal intervals.\n\nAfter the ship has reached its cruising speed of 0.8''c'', each twin would see 1&nbsp;second pass in the received image of the other twin for every 3&nbsp;seconds of his own time. That is, each would see the image of the other's clock going slow, not just slow by the ''\u03b5'' factor 0.6, but even slower because light-time-delay is increasing 0.8&nbsp;seconds per second. This is shown in the figures by red light paths. At some point, the images received by each twin change so that each would see 3&nbsp;seconds pass in the image for every second of his own time. That is, the received signal has been increased in frequency by the Doppler shift. These high frequency images are shown in the figures by blue light paths.\n\n===The asymmetry in the Doppler shifted images===\nThe asymmetry between the Earth and the space ship is manifested in this diagram by the fact that more blue-shifted (fast aging) images are received by the ship. Put another way, the space ship sees the image change from a red-shift (slower aging of the image) to a blue-shift (faster aging of the image) at the midpoint of its trip (at the turnaround, 5&nbsp;years after departure); the Earth sees the image of the ship change from red-shift to blue shift after 9&nbsp;years (almost at the end of the period that the ship is absent). In the next section, one will see another asymmetry in the images: the Earth twin sees the ship twin age by the same amount in the red and blue shifted images; the ship twin sees the Earth twin age by different amounts in the red and blue shifted images.\n\n==Calculation of elapsed time from the Doppler diagram==\nThe twin on the ship sees low frequency (red) images for 3 years. During that time, he would see the Earth twin in the image grow older by {{nowrap|3/3 {{=}} 1 years}}. He then sees high frequency (blue) images during the back trip of 3&nbsp;years. During that time, he would see the Earth twin in the image grow older by {{nowrap|3 \u00d7 3 {{=}} 9 years.}} When the journey is finished, the image of the Earth twin has aged by {{nowrap|1 + 9 {{=}} 10 years.}}\n\nThe Earth twin sees 9 years of slow (red) images of the ship twin, during which the ship twin ages (in the image) by {{nowrap|9/3 {{=}} 3 years.}} He then sees fast (blue) images for the remaining 1&nbsp;year until the ship returns. In the fast images, the ship twin ages by {{nowrap|1 \u00d7 3 {{=}} 3 years.}} The total aging of the ship twin in the images received by Earth is {{nowrap|3 + 3 {{=}} 6 years}}, so the ship twin returns younger (6&nbsp;years as opposed to 10&nbsp;years on Earth).\n\n===The distinction between what they see and what they calculate===\nTo avoid confusion, note the distinction between what each twin sees and what each would calculate. Each sees an image of his twin which he knows originated at a previous time and which he knows is Doppler shifted. He does not take the elapsed time in the image as the age of his twin now.\n*If he wants to calculate when his twin was the age shown in the image (''i.e.'' how old he himself was then), he has to determine how far away his twin was when the signal was emitted\u2014in other words, he has to consider simultaneity for a distant event.\n*If he wants to calculate how fast his twin was aging when the image was transmitted, he adjusts for the Doppler shift. For example, when he receives high frequency images (showing his twin aging rapidly) with frequency <math>\\scriptstyle{f_\\mathrm{rest}\\sqrt{\\left({1 + v/c}\\right)/\\left({1 - v/c}\\right)}}</math>, he does not conclude that the twin was aging that rapidly when the image was generated, any more than he concludes that the siren of an ambulance is emitting the frequency he hears. He knows that the [[Doppler effect]] has increased the image frequency by the factor 1 / (1 \u2212 ''v''/''c''). Therefore, he calculates that his twin was aging at the rate of\n:<math>f_\\mathrm{rest}\\sqrt{\\left({1 + v/c}\\right)/\\left({1 - v/c}\\right)}\\times \\left(1 - v/c\\right) = f_\\mathrm{rest}\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}\\equiv\\epsilon f_\\mathrm{rest}</math>\nwhen the image was emitted. A similar calculation reveals that his twin was aging at the same reduced rate of ''\u03b5f''<sub>rest</sub> in all low frequency images.\n\n===Simultaneity in the Doppler shift calculation===\nIt may be difficult to see where simultaneity came into the Doppler shift calculation, and indeed the calculation is often preferred because one does not have to worry about simultaneity. As seen above, the ship twin can convert his received Doppler-shifted rate to a slower rate of the clock of the distant clock for both red and blue images. If he ignores simultaneity, he might say his twin was aging at the reduced rate throughout the journey and therefore should be younger than he is. He is now back to square one, and has to take into account the change in his notion of simultaneity at the turnaround. The rate he can calculate for the image (corrected for Doppler effect) is the rate of the Earth twin's clock at the moment it was sent, not at the moment it was received. Since he receives an unequal number of red and blue shifted images, he should realize that the red and blue shifted emissions were not emitted over equal time periods for the Earth twin, and therefore he must account for simultaneity at a distance.\n\n==Viewpoint of the traveling twin==\nDuring the turnaround, the traveling twin is in an [[accelerated reference frame]]. According to the [[equivalence principle]], the traveling twin may analyze the turnaround phase as if the stay-at-home twin were freely falling in a gravitational field and as if the traveling twin were stationary. A 1918 paper by Einstein presents a conceptual sketch of the idea.<ref group=A>Einstein, A. (1918) \"[[s:Dialog about objections against the theory of relativity|dialog about objections against the theory of relativity]]\", ''Die Naturwissenschaften'' '''48''', pp. 697\u2013702, 29 November 1918</ref> From the viewpoint of the traveler, a calculation for each separate leg, ignoring the turnaround, leads to a result in which the Earth clocks age less than the traveler. For example, if the Earth clocks age 1&nbsp;day less on each leg, the amount that the Earth clocks will lag behind amounts to 2&nbsp;days. The physical description of what happens at turnaround has to produce a contrary effect of double that amount: 4&nbsp;days' advancing of the Earth clocks. Then the traveler's clock will end up with a net 2-day delay on the Earth clocks, in agreement with calculations done in the frame of the stay-at-home twin.\n\nThe mechanism for the advancing of the stay-at-home twin's clock is [[gravitational time dilation]]. When an observer finds that inertially moving objects are being accelerated with respect to themselves, those objects are in a gravitational field insofar as relativity is concerned. For the traveling twin at turnaround, this gravitational field fills the universe. In a weak field approximation, clocks tick at a rate of {{nowrap|<var>t'</var> {{=}} ''t'' (1 + ''\u03a6'' / ''c''<sup>2</sup>)}} where ''\u03a6'' is the difference in gravitational potential. In this case, {{nowrap|''\u03a6'' {{=}} ''gh''}} where ''g'' is the acceleration of the traveling observer during turnaround and ''h'' is the distance to the stay-at-home twin. The rocket is firing towards the stay-at-home twin, thereby placing that twin at a higher gravitational potential. Due to the large distance between the twins, the stay-at-home twin's clocks will appear to be sped up enough to account for the difference in proper times experienced by the twins. It is no accident that this speed-up is enough to account for the simultaneity shift described above. The general relativity solution for a static homogeneous gravitational field and the special relativity solution for finite acceleration produce identical results.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Jones |first=Preston |title=The clock paradox in a static homogeneous gravitational field |journal=Foundations of Physics Letters |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=75\u201385 |date=February 2006 |author2=Wanex, L.F.  |arxiv=physics/0604025 |doi=10.1007/s10702-006-1850-3 |bibcode=2006FoPhL..19...75J}}</ref>\n\nOther calculations have been done for the traveling twin (or for any observer who sometimes accelerates), which do not involve the equivalence principle, and which do not involve any gravitational fields. Such calculations are based only on the special theory, not the general theory, of relativity.

But because of this it should not be concluded, as has sometimes happened prematurely, that the concept of aether must be abandoned, that the aether is non-existent and inaccessible to experiment. Only a uniform velocity relative to it cannot be detected, but any change of velocity .. has an absolute sense.\"<ref>Langevin, P. (1911), \"The evolution of space and time\", Scientia, X: p.47 (translated by J. B.

It is not that they are constrained to do so; they consider this new convention more convenient; that is all.

Wheeler calls \"ether theory B (length contraction plus time contraction)\", did not gain as much traction as Einstein's, which simply disregarded any deeper reality behind the symmetrical measurements across inertial frames.

The traveler remains in a projectile for one year of his time, and then reverses direction. Upon return, the traveler will find that he has aged two years, while 200 years have passed on Earth. During the trip, both the traveler and Earth keep sending signals to each other at a constant rate, which places Langevin's story among the Doppler shift versions of the twin paradox. The relativistic effects upon the signal rates are used to account for the different aging rates.

The traveling twin transfers his clock reading to a third one, traveling in the opposite direction. Another way of avoiding acceleration effects is the use of the relativistic Doppler effect (see [[#What_it_looks_like:_the_relativistic_Doppler_shift|What it looks like: the relativistic Doppler shift]] below).\n\nNeither Einstein nor Langevin considered such results to be problematic: Einstein only called it \"peculiar\" while Langevin presented it as a consequence of absolute acceleration.<ref group=A>\"We are going to see this absolute character of the acceleration manifest itself in another form.\" (\"Nous allons voir se manifester sous une autre forme ce caract\u00e8re absolu de l'acc\u00e9l\u00e9ration.\"), page 82 of Langevin1911</ref> Both men argued that, from the time differential illustrated by the story of the twins, no self-contradiction could be constructed. In other words, neither Einstein nor Langevin saw the story of the twins as constituting a challenge to the self-consistency of relativistic physics.\n\n==Specific example==\nConsider a space ship traveling from Earth to the nearest star system: a distance {{nowrap|''d'' {{=}} 4 light}} years away, at a speed {{nowrap|''v'' {{=}} 0.8''c''}} (i.e., 80 percent of the speed of light).\n\nTo make the numbers easy, the ship is assumed to attain full speed in a negligible time upon departure (even though it would actually take close to a year accelerating at [[Standard gravity|1&nbsp;''g'']] to get up to speed). Similarly, at the end of the outgoing trip, the change in direction needed to start the return trip is assumed to occur in a negligible time. \n\nThe parties will observe the situation as follows:<ref>{{cite book\n|title=Textbook Of Engineering Physics, Part I\n|first1=Mahesh C.\n|last1=Jain\n|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt\n|year=2009\n|isbn=8120338626\n|page=74\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DqZlU3RJTywC&pg=PA74}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=DqZlU3RJTywC&pg=PA74 Extract of page 74]\n</ref><ref>{{cite book\n|title=Introduction to Relativity\n|first1=P.

The amount of time as measured on the ship's clocks and the aging of the travelers during their trip will be reduced by the factor <math>\\varepsilon = \\scriptstyle{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}</math>, the reciprocal of the [[Lorentz factor]] ([[time dilation]]). In this case {{nowrap|''\u03b5'' {{=}} 0.6}} and the travelers will have aged only {{nowrap|0.6 \u00d7 10 {{=}} 6 years}} when they return.\n\n=== Travellers' perspective ===\nThe ship's crew members also calculate the particulars of their trip from their perspective. They know that the distant star system and the Earth are moving relative to the ship at speed ''v'' during the trip. In their rest frame the distance between the Earth and the star system is {{nowrap|''\u03b5d'' {{=}} 0.6 \u00d7 4 {{=}} 2.4 light}} years ([[length contraction]]), for both the outward and return journeys. Each half of the journey takes {{nowrap|''\u03b5d'' / ''v'' {{=}} 2.4 / 0.8 {{=}} 3 years}}, and the round trip takes twice as long (6 years). Their calculations show that they will arrive home having aged 6&nbsp;years. The travelers' final calculation about their aging is in complete agreement with the calculations of those on Earth, though they experience the trip quite differently from those who stay at home.\n\n=== Conclusion ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Readings on Earth's and spaceship's clocks\n!

Spaceship<br>(years)\n|-\n| Departure || 0 || 0 \n|-\n| End of outgoing trip =<br>Beginning of ingoing trip || 5 || 3\n|-\n| Arrival || 10 || 6\n|}\nNo matter what method they use to predict the clock readings, everybody will agree about them. If twins are born on the day the ship leaves, and one goes on the journey while the other stays on Earth, they will meet again when the traveler is 6&nbsp;years old and the stay-at-home twin is 10&nbsp;years old.\n\n==Resolution of the paradox in special relativity==\n\nThe paradoxical aspect of the twins' situation arises from the fact that at any given moment the travelling twin's clock is running slow in the earthbound twin's inertial frame, but based on the relativity principle one could equally argue that the earthbound twin's clock is running slow in the travelling twin's inertial frame.<ref name='Ohanian'>{{cite book|last=Ohanian|first=Hans|title=Special relativity: a modern introduction|date=2001|publisher=Physics Curriculum and Instruction|location=Lakeville, MN|isbn=0971313415}}</ref><ref name='Harris'>{{cite book|last=Harris|first=Randy|title=Modern Physics|date=2008|publisher=Pearson Addison-Wesley|location=San Francisco, CA|isbn=0805303081}}</ref><ref name='Rindler'>{{cite book|last=Rindler|first=W|title=Introduction to special relativity|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=9780198567318}}</ref> One proposed resolution is based on the fact that the earthbound twin is at rest in the same inertial frame throughout the journey, while the travelling twin is not: in the simplest version of the thought-experiment, the travelling twin switches at the midpoint of the trip from being at rest in an inertial frame which moves in one direction (away from the Earth) to being at rest in an inertial frame which moves in the opposite direction (towards the Earth). In this approach, determining which observer switches frames and which does not is crucial. Although both twins can legitimately claim that they are at rest in their own frame, only the traveling twin experiences acceleration when the spaceship engines are turned on. This acceleration, measurable with an accelerometer, makes his rest frame temporarily non-inertial. This reveals a crucial asymmetry between the twins's perspectives: although we can predict the aging difference from both perspectives, we need to use different methods to obtain correct results.\n\n===Role of acceleration===\nAlthough some solutions attribute a crucial role to the acceleration of the travelling twin at the time of the turnaround,<ref name='Ohanian'/><ref name='Harris'/><ref name='Rindler'/><ref name='Weidner'>{{cite book|last=Weidner|first=Richard|title=Physics|url=https://archive.org/details/physics0000weid|url-access=registration|date=1985|publisher=Allyn and Bacon|location=Needham Heights, MA|isbn=0205111556}}</ref> others note that the effect also arises if one imagines two separate travellers, one outward-going and one inward-coming, who pass each other and synchronize their clocks at the point corresponding to \"turnaround\" of a single traveller.

There is a difference between the trajectories of the twins: the trajectory of the ship is equally divided between two different inertial frames, while the Earth-based twin stays in the same inertial frame.]]\nFor a moment-by-moment understanding of how the time difference between the twins unfolds, one must understand that in special relativity there is no concept of ''absolute present''. For different inertial frames there are different sets of events that are simultaneous in that frame. This [[relativity of simultaneity]] means that switching from one inertial frame to another requires an adjustment in what slice through spacetime counts as the \"present\". In the spacetime diagram on the right, drawn for the reference frame of the Earth-based twin, that twin's world line coincides with the vertical axis (his position is constant in space, moving only in time). On the first leg of the trip, the second twin moves to the right (black sloped line); and on the second leg, back to the left. Blue lines show the ''planes of simultaneity'' for the traveling twin during the first leg of the journey; red lines, during the second leg. Just before turnaround, the traveling twin calculates the age of the Earth-based twin by measuring the interval along the vertical axis from the origin to the upper blue line. Just after turnaround, if he recalculates, he will measure the interval from the origin to the lower red line. In a sense, during the U-turn the plane of simultaneity jumps from blue to red and very quickly sweeps over a large segment of the world line of the Earth-based twin.

Also, according to the so-called \"clock postulate\", physical acceleration of clocks doesn't contribute to the [[kinematical]] effects of special relativity. Rather, the time differential between two reunited clocks is produced purely by uniform [[inertial motion]], as discussed in Einstein's original 1905 relativity paper,<ref name=\"Einstein, A. 1923 pp. 38\"/> as well as in all subsequent kinematical derivations of the Lorentz transformations.\n\nBecause spacetime diagrams incorporate Einstein's clock synchronization (with its lattice of clocks methodology), there will be a requisite jump in the reading of the Earth clock time made by a \"suddenly returning astronaut\" who inherits a \"new meaning of simultaneity\" in keeping with a new clock synchronization dictated by the transfer to a different inertial frame, as explained in Spacetime Physics by John A. Wheeler.<ref name=\"Wheeler, J. 1992 pp. 38, 170\"/>\n\nIf, instead of incorporating Einstein's clock synchronization (lattice of clocks), the astronaut (outgoing and incoming) and the Earth-based party regularly update each other on the status of their clocks by way of sending radio signals (which travel at light speed), then all parties will note an incremental buildup of asymmetry in time-keeping, beginning at the \"turn around\" point. Prior to the \"turn around\", each party regards the other party's clock to be recording time differently from his own, but the noted difference is symmetrical between the two parties. After the \"turn around\", the noted differences are not symmetrical, and the asymmetry grows incrementally until the two parties are reunited. Upon finally reuniting, this asymmetry can be seen in the actual difference showing on the two reunited clocks.<ref>William Geraint Vaughan Rosser (1991).

Or, if each twin always carried a clock indicating his age, what time would each see in the image of their distant twin and his clock?\n\nShortly after departure, the traveling twin sees the stay-at-home twin with no time delay. At arrival, the image in the ship screen shows the staying twin as he was 1&nbsp;year after launch, because radio emitted from Earth 1&nbsp;year after launch gets to the other star 4&nbsp;years afterwards and meets the ship there. During this leg of the trip, the traveling twin sees his own clock advance 3&nbsp;years and the clock in the screen advance 1&nbsp;year, so it seems to advance at {{frac|3}} the normal rate, just 20&nbsp;image seconds per ship minute. This combines the effects of time dilation due to motion (by factor \u03b5=0.6, five years on earth are 3&nbsp;years on ship) and the effect of increasing light-time-delay (which grows from 0 to 4&nbsp;years).\n\nOf course, the observed frequency of the transmission is also {{frac|3}} the frequency of the transmitter (a reduction in frequency; \"red-shifted\"). This is called the [[relativistic Doppler effect]]. The frequency of clock-ticks (or of wavefronts) which one sees from a source with rest frequency ''f''<sub>rest</sub> is\n:<math>f_\\mathrm{obs} = f_\\mathrm{rest}\\sqrt{\\left({1 - v/c}\\right)/\\left({1 + v/c}\\right)}</math>\nwhen the source is moving directly away. This is ''f''<sub>obs</sub> = {{frac|3}}''f''<sub>rest</sub> for ''v''/''c'' = 0.8.\n\nAs for the stay-at-home twin, he gets a slowed signal from the ship for 9&nbsp;years, at a frequency {{frac|3}} the transmitter frequency. During these 9&nbsp;years, the clock of the traveling twin in the screen seems to advance 3&nbsp;years, so both twins see the image of their sibling aging at a rate only {{frac|3}} their own rate. Expressed in other way, they would both see the other's clock run at {{frac|3}} their own clock speed. If they factor out of the calculation the fact that the light-time delay of the transmission is increasing at a rate of 0.8&nbsp;seconds per second, ''both'' can work out that the other twin is aging slower, at 60% rate.\n\nThen the ship turns back toward home. The clock of the staying twin shows \"1&nbsp;year after launch\" in the screen of the ship, and during the 3&nbsp;years of the trip back it increases up to \"10&nbsp;years after launch\", so the clock in the screen seems to be advancing 3&nbsp;times faster than usual.\n\nWhen the source is moving towards the observer, the observed frequency is higher (\"blue-shifted\") and given by\n:<math>f_\\mathrm{obs} = f_\\mathrm{rest}\\sqrt{\\left({1 + v/c}\\right)/\\left({1 - v/c}\\right)}</math>\nThis is ''f''<sub>obs</sub> = 3''f''<sub>rest</sub> for ''v''/''c'' = 0.8.\n\nAs for the screen on Earth, it shows that trip back beginning 9&nbsp;years after launch, and the traveling clock in the screen shows that 3&nbsp;years have passed on the ship. One year later, the ship is back home and the clock shows 6&nbsp;years. So, during the trip back, ''both'' twins see their sibling's clock going 3&nbsp;times faster than their own. Factoring out the fact that the light-time-delay is decreasing by 0.8&nbsp;seconds every second, each twin calculates that the other twin is aging at 60% his own aging speed.\n\n[[Image:rstd4.gif|thumb|left|Light paths for images exchanged during trip<br>Left: Earth to ship. Right: Ship to Earth.<br>\nRed lines indicate low frequency images are received, blue lines indicate high frequency images are received]]\nThe ''x''\u2013''t'' (space\u2013time) diagrams at left show the paths of light signals traveling between Earth and ship (1st diagram) and between ship and Earth (2nd diagram). These signals carry the images of each twin and his age-clock to the other twin. The vertical black line is the Earth's path through spacetime and the other two sides of the triangle show the ship's path through spacetime (as in the Minkowski diagram above). As far as the sender is concerned, he transmits these at equal intervals (say, once an hour) according to his own clock; but according to the clock of the twin receiving these signals, they are not being received at equal intervals.\n\nAfter the ship has reached its cruising speed of 0.8''c'', each twin would see 1&nbsp;second pass in the received image of the other twin for every 3&nbsp;seconds of his own time. That is, each would see the image of the other's clock going slow, not just slow by the ''\u03b5'' factor 0.6, but even slower because light-time-delay is increasing 0.8&nbsp;seconds per second. This is shown in the figures by red light paths. At some point, the images received by each twin change so that each would see 3&nbsp;seconds pass in the image for every second of his own time. That is, the received signal has been increased in frequency by the Doppler shift. These high frequency images are shown in the figures by blue light paths.\n\n===The asymmetry in the Doppler shifted images===\nThe asymmetry between the Earth and the space ship is manifested in this diagram by the fact that more blue-shifted (fast aging) images are received by the ship. Put another way, the space ship sees the image change from a red-shift (slower aging of the image) to a blue-shift (faster aging of the image) at the midpoint of its trip (at the turnaround, 5&nbsp;years after departure); the Earth sees the image of the ship change from red-shift to blue shift after 9&nbsp;years (almost at the end of the period that the ship is absent). In the next section, one will see another asymmetry in the images: the Earth twin sees the ship twin age by the same amount in the red and blue shifted images; the ship twin sees the Earth twin age by different amounts in the red and blue shifted images.\n\n==Calculation of elapsed time from the Doppler diagram==\nThe twin on the ship sees low frequency (red) images for 3 years. During that time, he would see the Earth twin in the image grow older by {{nowrap|3/3 {{=}} 1 years}}. He then sees high frequency (blue) images during the back trip of 3&nbsp;years. During that time, he would see the Earth twin in the image grow older by {{nowrap|3 \u00d7 3 {{=}} 9 years.}} When the journey is finished, the image of the Earth twin has aged by {{nowrap|1 + 9 {{=}} 10 years.}}\n\nThe Earth twin sees 9 years of slow (red) images of the ship twin, during which the ship twin ages (in the image) by {{nowrap|9/3 {{=}} 3 years.}} He then sees fast (blue) images for the remaining 1&nbsp;year until the ship returns. In the fast images, the ship twin ages by {{nowrap|1 \u00d7 3 {{=}} 3 years.}} The total aging of the ship twin in the images received by Earth is {{nowrap|3 + 3 {{=}} 6 years}}, so the ship twin returns younger (6&nbsp;years as opposed to 10&nbsp;years on Earth).\n\n===The distinction between what they see and what they calculate===\nTo avoid confusion, note the distinction between what each twin sees and what each would calculate. Each sees an image of his twin which he knows originated at a previous time and which he knows is Doppler shifted. He does not take the elapsed time in the image as the age of his twin now.\n*If he wants to calculate when his twin was the age shown in the image (''i.e.'' how old he himself was then), he has to determine how far away his twin was when the signal was emitted\u2014in other words, he has to consider simultaneity for a distant event.\n*If he wants to calculate how fast his twin was aging when the image was transmitted, he adjusts for the Doppler shift. For example, when he receives high frequency images (showing his twin aging rapidly) with frequency <math>\\scriptstyle{f_\\mathrm{rest}\\sqrt{\\left({1 + v/c}\\right)/\\left({1 - v/c}\\right)}}</math>, he does not conclude that the twin was aging that rapidly when the image was generated, any more than he concludes that the siren of an ambulance is emitting the frequency he hears. He knows that the [[Doppler effect]] has increased the image frequency by the factor 1 / (1 \u2212 ''v''/''c''). Therefore, he calculates that his twin was aging at the rate of\n:<math>f_\\mathrm{rest}\\sqrt{\\left({1 + v/c}\\right)/\\left({1 - v/c}\\right)}\\times \\left(1 - v/c\\right) = f_\\mathrm{rest}\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}\\equiv\\epsilon f_\\mathrm{rest}</math>\nwhen the image was emitted. A similar calculation reveals that his twin was aging at the same reduced rate of ''\u03b5f''<sub>rest</sub> in all low frequency images.\n\n===Simultaneity in the Doppler shift calculation===\nIt may be difficult to see where simultaneity came into the Doppler shift calculation, and indeed the calculation is often preferred because one does not have to worry about simultaneity. As seen above, the ship twin can convert his received Doppler-shifted rate to a slower rate of the clock of the distant clock for both red and blue images. If he ignores simultaneity, he might say his twin was aging at the reduced rate throughout the journey and therefore should be younger than he is. He is now back to square one, and has to take into account the change in his notion of simultaneity at the turnaround. The rate he can calculate for the image (corrected for Doppler effect) is the rate of the Earth twin's clock at the moment it was sent, not at the moment it was received. Since he receives an unequal number of red and blue shifted images, he should realize that the red and blue shifted emissions were not emitted over equal time periods for the Earth twin, and therefore he must account for simultaneity at a distance.\n\n==Viewpoint of the traveling twin==\nDuring the turnaround, the traveling twin is in an [[accelerated reference frame]]. According to the [[equivalence principle]], the traveling twin may analyze the turnaround phase as if the stay-at-home twin were freely falling in a gravitational field and as if the traveling twin were stationary. A 1918 paper by Einstein presents a conceptual sketch of the idea.<ref group=A>Einstein, A. (1918) \"[[s:Dialog about objections against the theory of relativity|dialog about objections against the theory of relativity]]\", ''Die Naturwissenschaften'' '''48''', pp. 697\u2013702, 29 November 1918</ref> From the viewpoint of the traveler, a calculation for each separate leg, ignoring the turnaround, leads to a result in which the Earth clocks age less than the traveler. For example, if the Earth clocks age 1&nbsp;day less on each leg, the amount that the Earth clocks will lag behind amounts to 2&nbsp;days. The physical description of what happens at turnaround has to produce a contrary effect of double that amount: 4&nbsp;days' advancing of the Earth clocks. Then the traveler's clock will end up with a net 2-day delay on the Earth clocks, in agreement with calculations done in the frame of the stay-at-home twin.\n\nThe mechanism for the advancing of the stay-at-home twin's clock is [[gravitational time dilation]]. When an observer finds that inertially moving objects are being accelerated with respect to themselves, those objects are in a gravitational field insofar as relativity is concerned. For the traveling twin at turnaround, this gravitational field fills the universe. In a weak field approximation, clocks tick at a rate of {{nowrap|<var>t'</var> {{=}} ''t'' (1 + ''\u03a6'' / ''c''<sup>2</sup>)}} where ''\u03a6'' is the difference in gravitational potential. In this case, {{nowrap|''\u03a6'' {{=}} ''gh''}} where ''g'' is the acceleration of the traveling observer during turnaround and ''h'' is the distance to the stay-at-home twin. The rocket is firing towards the stay-at-home twin, thereby placing that twin at a higher gravitational potential. Due to the large distance between the twins, the stay-at-home twin's clocks will appear to be sped up enough to account for the difference in proper times experienced by the twins. It is no accident that this speed-up is enough to account for the simultaneity shift described above. The general relativity solution for a static homogeneous gravitational field and the special relativity solution for finite acceleration produce identical results.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Jones |first=Preston |title=The clock paradox in a static homogeneous gravitational field |journal=Foundations of Physics Letters |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=75\u201385 |date=February 2006 |author2=Wanex, L.F.  |arxiv=physics/0604025 |doi=10.1007/s10702-006-1850-3 |bibcode=2006FoPhL..19...75J}}</ref>\n\nOther calculations have been done for the traveling twin (or for any observer who sometimes accelerates), which do not involve the equivalence principle, and which do not involve any gravitational fields. Such calculations are based only on the special theory, not the general theory, of relativity.

But because of this it should not be concluded, as has sometimes happened prematurely, that the concept of aether must be abandoned, that the aether is non-existent and inaccessible to experiment. Only a uniform velocity relative to it cannot be detected, but any change of velocity .. has an absolute sense.\"<ref>Langevin, P.

Wheeler calls \"ether theory B (length contraction plus time contraction)\", did not gain as much traction as Einstein's, which simply disregarded any deeper reality behind the symmetrical measurements across inertial frames.

When a visitor presses a [[button (control)|button]] the [[bell]] rings inside the building, alerting the occupant to the presence of the visitor.  Although the first doorbells were mechanical, activated by pulling a cord, modern doorbells are electric, operated by a pushbutton switch.  Modern doorbells often incorporate [[intercom]]s and miniature [[video camera]]s to increase security.\n\n==History==\n[[William Murdoch]], a Scottish inventor, installed a number of his own innovations in his house, built in [[Birmingham]] in 1817; one of these was a loud doorbell, that worked using a piped system of compressed air.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rampantscotland.com/inventors/inventions_gas_lighting.htm|title=Scottish Inventions and Discoveries \u2014 Coal Gas Lighting \u2014 William Murdoch (1754\u20131839)}}</ref> A precursor to the electric doorbell, specifically a bell that could be rung at a distance via an electric wire, was invented by [[Joseph Henry]] around 1831.<ref>{{cite book|title=Scientific writings of Joseph Henry, Volume 30, Issue 2|url=https://books.google.com/?id=w6cKAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA434&lpg=PA434&dq=%22joseph+henry%22+%22i+arranged+around+one+of+the+upper+rooms%22#v=onepage&q=%22joseph%20henry%22%20%22i%20arranged%20around%20one%20of%20the%20upper%20rooms%22&f=false|pages=434|date=1886|publisher=Smithsonian Institution}}</ref> By the early 1900s, electric doorbells had become commonplace.\n\n==Wired doorbells==\nIn most wired systems, a button on the outside next to the door, located around the height of the doorknob, activates a signaling device (usually a [[tubular bell|chime]], [[Electric bell|bell]], or [[buzzer]]) inside the building.  Pressing the doorbell button, a single-pole, single-throw (SPST) pushbutton [[switch]] momentarily closes the doorbell circuit. One [[Terminal (electronics)|terminal]] of this button is wired to a terminal on a [[transformer]]. A doorbell transformer steps down the 120 or 240-volt [[Alternating current|AC]] electrical power to a lower [[voltage]], typically 10 to 20 volts. The transformer's other terminal connects to one of three terminals on the signaling device. Another terminal is connected to a wire that travels to the other terminal on the button. Some signaling devices have a third terminal, which produces a different sound. If there is another doorbell button (typically near a back door), it is connected between the transformer and the third terminal. The transformer primary winding, being energized continuously, does consume a small amount (about 1 to 2 W) of [[standby power]] constantly; systems with lighted pushbutton switches may consume a similar amount of power per switch.<ref>\"Why Did President Bush Suddenly Start Talking about Standby Power?\", a PowerPoint slide presentation by Alan Meier. http://www.energystar.gov/ia/partners/prod_development/downloads/power_supplies/PSPresent2.ppt energystar.gov</ref><ref>Miscellaneous Electricity Use In U.S. Homes Marla C.

The flat bars are tuned to two pleasing notes. When the doorbell button is pressed, the first solenoid's plunger strikes one bar, and when the button is released, a [[spring (device)|spring]] on the plunger pushes the plunger up, causing it to strike the other bar, creating a two-tone sound (\"''ding-dong''\").  If a second doorbell button is used, it is wired to the other solenoid, which strikes only one of the bars, to create a single-tone (\"''ding''\") sound.\n\nMore elaborate doorbell chimes play a short musical tune, such as [[Westminster Quarters]].\n\nDoorbells for [[hearing impairment|hearing-impaired]] people use visual signaling devices&nbsp;\u2014 typically [[light bulb]]s&nbsp;\u2014 rather than audible signaling devices.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gallaudet.edu/clerc_center/information_and_resources/info_to_go/hearing_and_communication_technology/alerting_devices/alerting_and_comm_dev_for_deaf_and_hoh_ppl.html |title=Alerting and Communicating Devices for Deaf and Hard of Hearing People&nbsp;\u2014 What's Available Now |publisher=Clerccenter.gallaudet.edu |accessdate=2011-09-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019192254/http://www.gallaudet.edu/clerc_center/information_and_resources/info_to_go/hearing_and_communication_technology/alerting_devices/alerting_and_comm_dev_for_deaf_and_hoh_ppl.html |archivedate=2012-10-19 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5369960 |title=NPR&nbsp;\u2014 At Gallaudet, a Turn Inward Opens New Worlds |publisher=Npr.org |date= |accessdate=2011-09-27}}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = center\n| image1   = DoorBell 004.jpg\n| caption1 = Two-tone doorbell chime\n| width1   = 100\n| image2   = Doorbell Wiring Pictorial Diagram.svg\n| caption2 = Typical two button doorbell circuit\n| width2   = 334\u2203\n}}\n\nFully battery-powered wired models are also common, either using a two-bar design or an electric bell.  These do not consume standby power, but require the user to change the batteries, which are usually large primary cells located in the [[bell box]].\n\n==Wireless doorbells==\n[[File:Melodika C590.JPG|thumb|Wireless doorbell with piezoelectric button]]\nIn recent decades wireless doorbells have become popular, to avoid the expense of running wires through the building walls. The doorbell button contains a built-in [[transmitter|radio transmitter]] powered by a battery. When the button is pushed, the transmitter sends a [[radio]] signal to the receiver unit, which is plugged into a wall outlet inside the building. When the radio signal is detected by the [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]], it activates a sound chip that plays the sound of gongs through a [[loudspeaker]]&mdash;either a two-note \"ding-dong\" sound or a longer chime sequence such as ''[[Westminster Quarters]]''.   [[Frequency|Frequencies]] in the 2.4&nbsp;GHz [[ISM band]] are usually used. To avoid interference by nearby wireless doorbells on the same radio [[frequency]], the units can usually be set by the owner to different radio channels.\n\nIn larger metropolitan cities, a trend has developed over the past decade that uses telephone technology to wirelessly signal doorbells as well as to answer the doors and remotely release [[electric strike]]s.  In many cities throughout the world, this is the predominant form of doorbell signalling.\n\n==Musical and continuous power doorbells==\nAs with wireless doorbells, musical doorbells have also become more common. Musical and continuous power doorbells serve as an attempt to bridge the gap between newer digital circuitry and older doorbell wiring schemes. A major difference between the standard setup of a wired doorbell and a musical doorbell is that the musical doorbell must maintain power after the doorbell button is released to continue playing the doorbell song. This can be achieved in one of two ways.\n\nFor simple [[Switch#Contact terminology|single-pole, single-throw]] doorbell buttons, the chime device employs a [[rectifier]] diode and ballast capacitor at the voltage input stage of the circuit. Upon pressing the doorbell button, power is connected through the rectifier diode or series of rectifier diodes called a full wave rectifier, which allows the current to flow in only one direction, into the ballast capacitor. The ballast capacitor charges at a rate far greater than the rest of the circuit needs to complete a given song. Once the button is released, the capacitor retains the charge and maintains power for a short duration to the rest of the circuit.\n\nFor mixed wireless and wired input doorbells, a special doorbell button is needed to maintain power continuously to the doorbell chime. The circuit is similar to the one above, except that the rectifier diode is now moved into the doorbell button housing. Pressing the doorbell button allows both negative and positive sides of the AC power signal to flow into the circuit, while releasing the button only allows either the positive or negative side to flow into the circuit. By differentiating the full and half wave signals, the doorbell is able to function as it does in the previous wired case, while also providing continuous power to the doorbell for other purposes, such as receiving wireless doorbell button input.\n\n==Mechanical bell systems==\n[[File:Staff Call Bells (7964118810).jpg|thumb|Staff Call Bells]]\nBefore electrical doorbells, large houses and estates often had complicated mechanical systems to allow occupants of any room to pull a [[bell pull]] and ring a bell at a central bell panel in the staff quarters, to summon a servant.<ref name=\"WhiteWhite2004\">{{cite book|author1=Larry Nash White|author2=Emily Blankenship White|title=Marietta|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aypgOGTrv30C&pg=PA34|accessdate=15 November 2011|date=February 2004|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=978-0-7385-3231-8|pages=34\u2013}}</ref>\n\n==Smart doorbells==\nWith the adoption of the \"Internet of Things\" a number of internet-connected bell systems, known as [[smart doorbell]]s have appeared on the market.\n\nPopular systems are the \"Skybell\", [[Ring (company)|Ring]] doorbell, [[Nest Labs]] doorbell, the Google \"Hello\", and many others.
