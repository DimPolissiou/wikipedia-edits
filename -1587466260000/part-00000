Quarterback Matt McGloin scored the first touchdown in team history on their first possession, a one-yard score that put them up 6-0. McGloin would later find [[Colby Pearson]] for a passing touchdown. Defensively, the Guardians forced three turnovers, including a fumble return for a touchdown by [[Jamar Summers]]. Tampa Bay reached the [[Red zone (gridiron football)|red zone]] five times, but emerged only with a field goal thanks to a standout defensive effort.\n\nThe Guardians' first road game saw them become the victims of the first shutout in the new XFL's history, as they fell to the [[DC Defenders]] by a 27-0 final at [[Audi Field]]. The game became notable for a McGloin sideline interview with ABC/ESPN's [[Dianna Russini]], in which he was very critical of the team's offensive gameplan. McGloin was eventually pulled from the game for backup [[Marquise Williams]] in the second half. \n\nNew York's next game was a visit to [[The Dome at America's Center]] to take on the [[St. Louis BattleHawks]]. Another one-sided loss awaited the Guardians, as they fell by a 29-9 final in St. Louis' home opener. McGloin was injured on the Guardians' first possession. He returned to the game, but missed the entire second half. New York did manage to end a streak of 26 consecutive possessions without a touchdown when third-string quarterback [[Luis Perez (American football)|Luis Perez]] found [[Austin Duke]] for an eight-yard score in the fourth quarter. \n\nWith McGloin out with an injury, Perez was the Guardians' starting quarterback for their Week 4 return to MetLife Stadium. Assisted by a strong rushing attack, Perez was able to guide the Guardians to a 17-14 victory over the [[Los Angeles Wildcats (XFL)|Los Angeles Wildcats]]. The Guardians tallied 122 yards on the ground, led by a tally of 82 from [[Darius Victor]]. New York took the lead for good on a 47-yard field goal from [[Matthew McCrane]], which was set up by a Summers interception. [[Jarrell Owens]] led the way defensively for the Guardians with two sacks and a blocked field goal. \n\nPerez earned another start when the Guardians hit the road again, taking on the [[Dallas Renegades]] at [[Globe Life Park in Arlington]]. The Guardians would go on to put up their most dominant effort of the season, crushing the Renegades by a 30-12 final. New York's key to victory was a series of 21 unanswered points in the third quarter. Williams came in to score a rushing touchdown from one yard out before Perez hooked up with Pearson for an 80-yard touchdown pass, the longest play in Guardians history. Linebacker [[Ryan Mueller]] capped the barrage off by returning an interception for a touchdown, the Guardians' second defensive score of the season. New York once again had a stellar rushing day, earning 144 yards on the ground. Victor once again led the way, this time with 58 of those yards.\n\nThe Guardians were set to take on the undefeated [[Houston Roughnecks]] at MetLife Stadium prior to the XFL's decision to suspend its season due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].

These novels are generally written by [[American literature|Americans]] and deal in some way with the question of America's [[Culture of the United States|national character]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} The Great American Novel is sometimes considered America's equivalent of the [[national epic]].{{By whom|date=February 2020}}\n\nThere is no consensus on which novel or novels deserve to be called the Great American Novel.
