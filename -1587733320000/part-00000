Their stripes come in different patterns, unique to each individual. They are generally social animals that live in small [[Harem (zoology)|harems]] to large [[herd]]s. Unlike their closest relatives, [[horse]]s and [[donkey]]s, zebras have never been truly [[domesticated]].\n\nThere are three species of zebras: the [[plains zebra]], the [[mountain zebra]] and the [[Gr\u00e9vy's zebra]]. The plains zebra and the mountain zebra belong to the subgenus ''[[Hippotigris]]'', while Gr\u00e9vy's zebra is the sole species of subgenus ''Dolichohippus''. The latter resembles an [[Asinus|ass]], to which zebras are closely related, while the former two look more horse-like. All three belong to the genus ''Equus'', along with other living equids.\n\nThe unique stripes of zebras make them one of the animals most familiar to people. They occur in a variety of habitats, such as [[grassland]]s, [[savanna]]s, [[woodland]]s, thorny [[scrubland]]s, [[mountain]]s, and coastal [[hill]]s. Various anthropogenic factors have had a severe impact on zebra populations, in particular hunting for skins and [[habitat destruction]]. Gr\u00e9vy's zebra and the mountain zebra are endangered. While plains zebras are much more plentiful, one subspecies, the [[quagga]], became extinct in the late 19th century \u2013 though there is currently a plan, called the [[Quagga Project]], that aims to breed zebras that are [[phenotype|phenotypically]] similar to the quagga in a process called [[breeding back]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2016/01/25/africa/quagga-project-zebra-conservation-extinct-south-africa/index.html|title=Quagga were extinct for 100 years.

It, or particular subspecies of it, have also been known as the common zebra, the [[dauw]], [[Burchell's zebra]] (actually the subspecies ''Equus quagga burchellii''), Chapman's zebra, [[Johan August Wahlberg|Wahlberg]]'s zebra, [[Frederick Selous|Selous]]' zebra, [[Grant's zebra]], Boehm's zebra and the [[quagga]] (another [[extinction|extinct]] subspecies, ''Equus quagga quagga'').\n\nThe [[mountain zebra]] (''Equus zebra'') of southwest Africa tends to have a sleek coat with a white belly and narrower stripes than the plains zebra. It has two subspecies and is classified as [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]].\n\n[[Gr\u00e9vy's zebra]] (''Equus grevyi'') is the largest type, with a long, narrow head, making it appear rather [[mule]]-like.

Gr\u00e9vy's zebra is the rarest species, and is classified as [[Endangered species|endangered]].\n\nAlthough zebra species may have overlapping ranges, they do not interbreed. In captivity, plains zebras have been crossed with mountain zebras. The hybrid foals lacked a [[dewlap]] and resembled the plains zebra apart from their larger ears and their hindquarters pattern. Attempts to breed a Gr\u00e9vy's zebra stallion to mountain zebra mares resulted in a high rate of miscarriage. In captivity, crosses between zebras and other (non-zebra) [[equine]]s have produced several distinct [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]], including the [[zebroid]], zeedonk, zony, and zorse.

Their social structure, however, depends on the species. [[Mountain zebra]]s and plains zebras live in groups, known as 'harems', consisting of one stallion with up to six mares and their foals. Bachelor males either live alone or with groups of other bachelors until they are old enough to challenge a breeding stallion. When attacked by packs of [[hyena]]s or [[African wild dog|wild dogs]] a zebra group will huddle together with the foals in the middle while the stallion tries to ward them off.\n\nUnlike the other zebra species, Gr\u00e9vy's zebras do not have permanent social bonds. A group of these zebras rarely stays together for more than a few months. The foals stay with their mothers, while adult males live alone. Like the other two zebra species, bachelor male zebras will organize in groups.\n\nLike horses, zebras sleep standing up, and only sleep when neighbors are around to warn them of predators.\n\n===Communication===\n[[File:Equus quagga boehmi (grazing).jpg|thumb|right|220px|Zebra feeding on grass]]\nZebras communicate with each other with high-pitched barks and whinnying. Gr\u00e9vy's zebras make mulelike brays. A zebra's ears signify its mood. When a zebra is in a calm, tense or friendly mood, its ears stand erect. When it is frightened, its ears are pushed forward. When angry, the ears are pulled backward. When surveying an area for predators, zebras will stand in an alert posture with ears erect, head held high, and staring. When tense, they will also snort. When a predator is spotted or sensed, a zebra will bark (or bray) loudly.\n\n===Food and foraging===\n[[File:Burchell's zebra, Okaukuejo Etosha, Namibia.jpg|thumb|[[Burchell's zebra]] drinking at a waterhole at [[Etosha National Park]]]]\nZebras feed almost entirely on grasses, but may occasionally eat shrubs, herbs, twigs, leaves and bark. Their digestive systems allow them to subsist on diets of lower nutritional quality than that necessary for other herbivores.\n\n===Reproduction===\n{{further|Plains zebra#Reproduction|Gr\u00e9vy's zebra#Reproduction}}\nFemale zebras mature earlier than the males, and a mare may have her first foal by the age of three. Males are not able to breed until the age of five or six. Mares may give birth to one foal every twelve months. She nurses the foal for up to a year. Like horses, zebras are able to stand, walk and suckle shortly after they are born. A zebra foal is brown and white instead of black and white at birth.\n\nPlains and mountain zebra foals are protected by their mothers, as well as the head stallion and the other mares in their group. Gr\u00e9vy's zebra foals have only their mother as a regular protector, since, as noted above, Gr\u00e9vy's zebra groups often disband after a few months.\n\n==Interaction with humans==\n\n===Domestication===\n[[File:WalterRothschildWithZebras.jpg|thumb|left|[[Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild|Lord Rothschild]] with his famed zebra carriage (sp. ''[[Plains zebra|Equus quagga burchellii]]''), which he frequently drove through [[London]]]]\n[[File:Cavallery of German Schutztruppe 1911.jpg|thumb|Cavalry of [[Schutztruppe]] in [[German East Africa]] (1911)]]\n\nAttempts have been made to train zebras for riding, since they have better resistance than horses to African diseases. While occasionally successful, most of these attempts failed due to the zebra's more unpredictable nature and tendency to panic under stress. For this reason, zebra-mules or [[zebroid]]s (crosses between any species of zebra and a horse, pony, donkey or ass) are preferred over purebred zebras. {{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nIn England, the zoological collector [[Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild|Walter Rothschild]] frequently used zebras to draw a carriage. In 1907, [[Rosendo Ribeiro]], the first doctor in Nairobi, Kenya, used a riding zebra for house calls. In the mid-19th century, Governor [[George Grey]] imported zebras to [[New Zealand]] from his previous posting in [[South Africa]], and used them to pull his carriage on his privately owned [[Kawau Island]].\n\n[[File:Zebra-tame-jumping.jpg|thumb|Jumping an obstacle: riding a zebra in East Africa, about 1900]]\nCaptain Horace Hayes, in \"Points of the Horse\" (circa 1893), compared the usefulness of different zebra species. In 1891, Hayes broke a mature, intact mountain zebra stallion to ride in two days' time, and the animal was quiet enough for his wife to ride and be photographed upon. He found the [[Burchell's zebra]] easy to break, and considered it ideal for domestication, as it was immune to the bite of the [[tsetse fly]]. He considered the [[quagga]] (now extinct) well-suited to domestication due to being easy to train to saddle and harness.<ref>Hayes, Capt. Horace (1893), ''[https://archive.org/details/pointsofhorsefam00hayerich Points of the Horse]'', pp. 311\u2013316, London: W. Thacker</ref>\n\n===Conservation===\nHumans have greatly impacted the zebra population. Zebras were, and still are, hunted for their skins and meat. They also compete with livestock for forage<ref name=Competition>{{Cite journal|author=Young, T.P.|title=Competition and compensation among cattle, zebras, and elephants in a semi-arid savanna in Laikipia, Kenya|journal=Biological Conservation |year=2005 |volume=121 |pages=351\u2013359|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2004.08.007|issue=2|url=http://gepv.univ-lille1.fr/downloads/enseignements/M1-S7/B16-Analyse%20d%27articles/Young%20et%20al.,%202005,%20Biol%20Conservation.pdf|display-authors=etal}}</ref> and are sometimes culled.\n\nThe Cape mountain zebra was hunted to near extinction, with less than 100 individuals by the 1930s. The population has since increased to about 700 due to conservation efforts. Both mountain zebra subspecies are currently protected in national parks, but are still endangered.\n\nThe Gr\u00e9vy's zebra is also endangered. Hunting and competition from livestock have greatly decreased their population. Because of the population's small size, environmental hazards, such as drought, are capable of affecting the entire species. Plains zebras are much more numerous and have a healthy population. Nevertheless, they too have been reduced by hunting and loss of habitat to farming.\n\n===Cultural depictions===\nZebras have been the subject of [[Africa]]n [[Folklore|folk tales]] which tell how they got their stripes. According to a [[San people|San]] folk tale of [[Namibia]], the zebra was once all white, but acquired its black stripes after a fight with a [[baboon]] over a waterhole. After kicking the baboon so hard, the zebra lost his balance and tripped over a fire, and the fire sticks left scorch marks all over his white coat.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.gateway-africa.com/stories/How_the_Zebra_Got_his_Stripes_San.html|title= How the Zebra got its stripes.

Their stripes come in different patterns, unique to each individual. They are generally social animals that live in small [[Harem (zoology)|harems]] to large [[herd]]s. Unlike their closest relatives, [[horse]]s and [[donkey]]s, zebras have never been truly [[domesticated]].\n\nThere are three species of zebras: the [[plains zebra]], the [[mountain zebra]] and the [[Gr\u00e9vy's zebra]]. The plains zebra and the mountain zebra belong to the subgenus ''[[Hippotigris]]'', while Gr\u00e9vy's zebra is the sole species of subgenus ''Dolichohippus''. The latter resembles an [[Asinus|ass]], to which zebras are closely related, while the former two look more horse-like. All three belong to the genus ''Equus'', along with other living equids.\n\nThe unique stripes of zebras make them one of the animals most familiar to people. They occur in a variety of habitats, such as [[grassland]]s, [[savanna]]s, [[woodland]]s, thorny [[scrubland]]s, [[mountain]]s, and coastal [[hill]]s. Various anthropogenic factors have had a severe impact on zebra populations, in particular hunting for skins and [[habitat destruction]]. Gr\u00e9vy's zebra and the mountain zebra are endangered. While plains zebras are much more plentiful, one subspecies, the [[quagga]], became extinct in the late 19th century \u2013 though there is currently a plan, called the [[Quagga Project]], that aims to breed zebras that are [[phenotype|phenotypically]] similar to the quagga in a process called [[breeding back]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2016/01/25/africa/quagga-project-zebra-conservation-extinct-south-africa/index.html|title=Quagga were extinct for 100 years.

It is an inhabitant of the semi-arid [[grassland]]s of [[Ethiopia]] and northern [[Kenya]]. Gr\u00e9vy's zebra is the rarest species, and is classified as [[Endangered species|endangered]].\n\nAlthough zebra species may have overlapping ranges, they do not interbreed. In captivity, plains zebras have been crossed with mountain zebras. The hybrid foals lacked a [[dewlap]] and resembled the plains zebra apart from their larger ears and their hindquarters pattern. Attempts to breed a Gr\u00e9vy's zebra stallion to mountain zebra mares resulted in a high rate of miscarriage. In captivity, crosses between zebras and other (non-zebra) [[equine]]s have produced several distinct [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]], including the [[zebroid]], zeedonk, zony, and zorse. In certain regions of Kenya, plains zebras and Gr\u00e9vy's zebra coexist, and fertile hybrids occur.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~dir/pdf_dir/2009_Cordingley_AnimConser.pdf|doi=10.1111/j.1469-1795.2009.00294.x|title=Is the endangered Grevy's zebra threatened by hybridization?|year=2009|last1=Cordingley|first1=J.

They are generally slower than horses, but their great [[endurance|stamina]] helps them outrun predators. When chased, a zebra will zig-zag from side to side, making it more difficult for the predator to attack. When cornered, the zebra will rear up and kick or bite its attacker.\n\n===Senses===\nZebras have excellent eyesight. Like most [[ungulate]]s, the zebra's eyes are on the sides of its head, giving it a wide field of view. Zebras also have [[night vision]], although not as advanced as that of most of their predators.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nZebras have excellent hearing and have larger, rounder ears than horses; like other ungulates, zebras can turn their ears in almost any direction.

Their social structure, however, depends on the species. [[Mountain zebra]]s and plains zebras live in groups, known as 'harems', consisting of one stallion with up to six mares and their foals. Bachelor males either live alone or with groups of other bachelors until they are old enough to challenge a breeding stallion. When attacked by packs of [[hyena]]s or [[African wild dog|wild dogs]] a zebra group will huddle together with the foals in the middle while the stallion tries to ward them off.\n\nUnlike the other zebra species, Gr\u00e9vy's zebras do not have permanent social bonds. A group of these zebras rarely stays together for more than a few months. The foals stay with their mothers, while adult males live alone. Like the other two zebra species, bachelor male zebras will organize in groups.\n\nLike horses, zebras sleep standing up, and only sleep when neighbors are around to warn them of predators.\n\n===Communication===\n[[File:Equus quagga boehmi (grazing).jpg|thumb|right|220px|Zebra feeding on grass]]\nZebras communicate with each other with high-pitched barks and whinnying. Gr\u00e9vy's zebras make mulelike brays. A zebra's ears signify its mood. When a zebra is in a calm, tense or friendly mood, its ears stand erect. When it is frightened, its ears are pushed forward. When angry, the ears are pulled backward. When surveying an area for predators, zebras will stand in an alert posture with ears erect, head held high, and staring. When tense, they will also snort. When a predator is spotted or sensed, a zebra will bark (or bray) loudly.\n\n===Food and foraging===\n[[File:Burchell's zebra, Okaukuejo Etosha, Namibia.jpg|thumb|[[Burchell's zebra]] drinking at a waterhole at [[Etosha National Park]]]]\nZebras feed almost entirely on grasses, but may occasionally eat shrubs, herbs, twigs, leaves and bark. Their digestive systems allow them to subsist on diets of lower nutritional quality than that necessary for other herbivores.\n\n===Reproduction===\n{{further|Plains zebra#Reproduction|Gr\u00e9vy's zebra#Reproduction}}\nFemale zebras mature earlier than the males, and a mare may have her first foal by the age of three. Males are not able to breed until the age of five or six. Mares may give birth to one foal every twelve months. She nurses the foal for up to a year. Like horses, zebras are able to stand, walk and suckle shortly after they are born. A zebra foal is brown and white instead of black and white at birth.\n\nPlains and mountain zebra foals are protected by their mothers, as well as the head stallion and the other mares in their group. Gr\u00e9vy's zebra foals have only their mother as a regular protector, since, as noted above, Gr\u00e9vy's zebra groups often disband after a few months.\n\n==Interaction with humans==\n\n===Domestication===\n[[File:WalterRothschildWithZebras.jpg|thumb|left|[[Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild|Lord Rothschild]] with his famed zebra carriage (sp. ''[[Plains zebra|Equus quagga burchellii]]''), which he frequently drove through [[London]]]]\n[[File:Cavallery of German Schutztruppe 1911.jpg|thumb|Cavalry of [[Schutztruppe]] in [[German East Africa]] (1911)]]\n\nAttempts have been made to train zebras for riding, since they have better resistance than horses to African diseases. While occasionally successful, most of these attempts failed due to the zebra's more unpredictable nature and tendency to panic under stress. For this reason, zebra-mules or [[zebroid]]s (crosses between any species of zebra and a horse, pony, donkey or ass) are preferred over purebred zebras. {{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nIn England, the zoological collector [[Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild|Walter Rothschild]] frequently used zebras to draw a carriage. In 1907, [[Rosendo Ribeiro]], the first doctor in Nairobi, Kenya, used a riding zebra for house calls. In the mid-19th century, Governor [[George Grey]] imported zebras to [[New Zealand]] from his previous posting in [[South Africa]], and used them to pull his carriage on his privately owned [[Kawau Island]].\n\n[[File:Zebra-tame-jumping.jpg|thumb|Jumping an obstacle: riding a zebra in East Africa, about 1900]]\nCaptain Horace Hayes, in \"Points of the Horse\" (circa 1893), compared the usefulness of different zebra species. In 1891, Hayes broke a mature, intact mountain zebra stallion to ride in two days' time, and the animal was quiet enough for his wife to ride and be photographed upon. He found the [[Burchell's zebra]] easy to break, and considered it ideal for domestication, as it was immune to the bite of the [[tsetse fly]]. He considered the [[quagga]] (now extinct) well-suited to domestication due to being easy to train to saddle and harness.<ref>Hayes, Capt. Horace (1893), ''[https://archive.org/details/pointsofhorsefam00hayerich Points of the Horse]'', pp. 311\u2013316, London: W. Thacker</ref>\n\n===Conservation===\nHumans have greatly impacted the zebra population. Zebras were, and still are, hunted for their skins and meat. They also compete with livestock for forage<ref name=Competition>{{Cite journal|author=Young, T.P.|title=Competition and compensation among cattle, zebras, and elephants in a semi-arid savanna in Laikipia, Kenya|journal=Biological Conservation |year=2005 |volume=121 |pages=351\u2013359|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2004.08.007|issue=2|url=http://gepv.univ-lille1.fr/downloads/enseignements/M1-S7/B16-Analyse%20d%27articles/Young%20et%20al.,%202005,%20Biol%20Conservation.pdf|display-authors=etal}}</ref> and are sometimes culled.\n\nThe Cape mountain zebra was hunted to near extinction, with less than 100 individuals by the 1930s. The population has since increased to about 700 due to conservation efforts. Both mountain zebra subspecies are currently protected in national parks, but are still endangered.\n\nThe Gr\u00e9vy's zebra is also endangered. Hunting and competition from livestock have greatly decreased their population. Because of the population's small size, environmental hazards, such as drought, are capable of affecting the entire species. Plains zebras are much more numerous and have a healthy population. Nevertheless, they too have been reduced by hunting and loss of habitat to farming.\n\n===Cultural depictions===\nZebras have been the subject of [[Africa]]n [[Folklore|folk tales]] which tell how they got their stripes. According to a [[San people|San]] folk tale of [[Namibia]], the zebra was once all white, but acquired its black stripes after a fight with a [[baboon]] over a waterhole. After kicking the baboon so hard, the zebra lost his balance and tripped over a fire, and the fire sticks left scorch marks all over his white coat.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.gateway-africa.com/stories/How_the_Zebra_Got_his_Stripes_San.html|title= How the Zebra got its stripes.

Zebras are featured on the [[coat of arms of Botswana]].\n\nSome on-field officials in various sports, especially [[American football]], [[basketball]], and [[ice hockey]], may be nicknamed \"zebras\" due to the resemblance of their black-and-white striped uniforms to the animal's markings.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:ZebraLudolphus.jpg|Illustration of a zebra from Ludolphus ''A new History of Ethiopia'' (1682).\nFile:Arms of Botswana.svg|Zebras on the [[Botswana]] [[Coat of arms of Botswana|coat of arms]].\n</gallery>\n\n===Biofuel===\nRecent research has shown that TU-103, a strain of ''[[Clostridium]]'' bacteria found in zebra feces, can convert nearly any form of cellulose into [[butanol fuel]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tulane.edu/news/releases/pr_082511.cfm |title=Cars Could Run on Recycled Newspaper, Tulane Scientists Say|first= Kathryn|last= Hobgood Ray |date= 2011-08-25|publisher= [[Tulane University]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141021085626/http://tulane.edu/news/releases/pr_082511.cfm|archivedate= 2014-10-21|url-status= live|accessdate= 2012-03-14}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Zebra_Meat.jpg|thumb|Grilled zebra meat in a restaurant in [[Munich]], [[Germany]].]]\n\n===Zebra as Food===\nThe zebra meat is counted an exotic food that can be found in some of exotic restaurants in Europe or US.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Dazzle camouflage]]\n* [[Tijuana Zebra]]\n* [[Zebra crossing]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Churcher, C.
