Jabotinsky's older brother Myron died when Vladimir was six months old, and his father died when he was six years old. His sister, Tereza (Tamara Yevgenyevna) Zhabotinskaya-Kopp, founded a private [[Gymnasium (school)|school]] for girls in Odessa. In 1885, the family moved to Germany due to his father's illness, returning a year later after his father's death.\n\nRaised in a middle-class Jewish home, Jabotinsky was educated in Russian schools. Although he studied Hebrew as a child, he wrote in his autobiography that his upbringing was divorced from [[Judaism|Jewish faith]] and tradition. His mother ran a stationery store in Odessa. Jabotinsky dropped out of school at the age of 17 with a guarantee of a job as a correspondent for a local Odessan newspaper,{{sfn|Halkin|2014|pp=16\u201317}} the ''Odesskiy Listok'', and was sent to [[Bern]] and [[Rome]] as a correspondent.

Because of Russian Easter, the newspapers had not been issued for the previous two days so that we remained without any news from the rest of the world. That night the Jewish audience assembled in the Beseda Club, to listen to the talk of a young Zionist, the Odessa 'wunderkind' V. Jabotinsky [\u2026.] The young agitator had great success with his audience. In a particularly moving manner, he drew on Pinsker's parable of the Jew as a shadow wandering through space and developed it further. As for my own impression, this one-sided treatment of our historical problem depressed me: Did he not scarcely stop short of inducing fear in our unstable Jewish youth of their own national shadow?\u2026 During the break, while pacing up and down in the neighbouring room, I noticed sudden unrest in the audience: the news spread that fugitives had arrived in Odessa from nearby Kishinev and had reported of a bloody pogrom in progress there.\"</ref> With more pogroms looming on the horizon, he established the Jewish Self-Defense Organization, a Jewish militant group, to safeguard Jewish communities throughout Russia. He became the source of great controversy in the Russian Jewish community as a result of these actions.\n\nAround this time, he began learning [[modern Hebrew]], and took a Hebrew name: ''Vladimir'' became ''Ze'ev'' (\"wolf\"). During the pogroms, he organized self-defense units in [[Jewish]] communities across Russia and fought for the [[civil rights]] of the Jewish population as a whole. His slogan was, \"Better to have a gun and not need it than to need it and not have it!\" Another slogan was, \"Jewish youth, learn to shoot!\"\n\nIn 1903, he was elected as a Russian delegate to the Sixth [[Zionist Congress]] in Basel, Switzerland. After [[Theodore Herzl]]'s death in 1904, he became the leader of the right-wing Zionists. That year he moved to [[Saint Petersburg]] and became one of the co-editors for the Russophone magazine ''Yevreiskaya Zhyzn'' (Jewish Life), which after 1907 became the official publishing body of the Zionist movement in Russia. In the pages of the newspaper, Jabotinsky wrote fierce polemics against supporters of assimilation and the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bund]].\n\nIn 1905, he was one of the co-founders of the \"Union for Rights Equality of Jewish People in Russia\". The following year, he was one of the chief speakers at the 3rd All-Russian Conference of Zionists in [[Helsinki]] (Helsingfors), which called upon the Jews of Europe to engage in ''Gegenwartsarbeit'' (work in the present) and to join together to demand autonomy for ethnic minorities in Russia.<ref name=\"liberal.org.il\">{{cite web|url=http://www.liberal.org.il/the_man.htm |title=Jabotinsky Ze'ev.

Jabotinsky became editor-in-chief of a new pro-Young-Turkish daily newspaper ''Jeune Turc'', which was founded and financed by Zionist officials like WZO president [[David Wolffsohn]] and his representative in Constantinople Victor Jacobson. The journalists writing for that paper included the famous German Social democrat and Russian-Jewish revolutionary [[Parvus]], who lived in Constantinople from 1910 until 1914. The ''Jeune Turc'' was prohibited in 1915 by the pro-German Turkish military junta. Richard Lichtheim, who was to become Jabotinsky's representative in Germany in 1925, stayed in Constantinople as WZO representative and managed to keep the \"Yishuv\" out of trouble during the war years by constant diplomatic interventions with Germans, Turks, and also US authorities, whose humanitarian support was crucial for the survival of the Jewish settlement project in Palestine during the war years.<ref>For references, see Richard Lichtheims autobiographical books in Hebrew and German (see the Hebrew Wikipedia entry of Richard Lichtheim)</ref>\n\n==Military career==\n[[File: ZEEV JABOTINSKY IN ARMY UNIFORM DURING WORLD WAR 1. \u05e4\u05d5\u05e8\u05d8\u05e8\u05d8, \u05d6\u05d0\u05d1 \u05d6'\u05d1\u05d5\u05d8\u05d9\u05e0\u05e1\u05e7\u05d9 \u05d1\u05de\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd \u05e6\u05d1\u05d0\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd, \u05d1\u05d6\u05de\u05df \u05de\u05dc\u05d7\u05de\u05ea \u05d4\u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd \u05d4\u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d5\u05e0\u05d4.D850-054.jpg|thumb|right|Ze'ev Jabotinsky served in platoon 16 of the [[20th Battalion, London Regiment (Blackheath and Woolwich)|20th Battalion]] of the [[London Regiment]] between 1916 and 1917]]\n[[File:Jabotinsky_in_Jewish_Legion.jpg|thumb|right|Lt Jabotinsky in the uniform of the Royal Fusiliers]]\n[[File:\u05e2\u05d9\u05d8\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05e6\u05d1\u05d0\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd \u05e9\u05dc \u05d6\u05d0\u05d1 \u05d6'\u05d1\u05d5\u05d8\u05d9\u05e0\u05e1\u05e7\u05d9.jpg|thumb|Miniatures of the [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]], [[British War Medal]] and [[Victory Medal (United Kingdom)|Victory Medal]] awarded to Jabotinsky]]\n[[File: AJI view 20121204 141410.jpg|thumb|right|Testimonial to Jabotinsky from the 38th Battalion Royal Fusiliers]]\n\nDuring World War I, he had the idea of establishing a Jewish Legion to fight alongside the British against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] who then controlled [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. In 1915, together with [[Joseph Trumpeldor]], a one-armed veteran of the [[Russo-Japanese War]], he created the [[Zion Mule Corps]], which consisted of several hundred Jewish men, mainly Russians who had been exiled from Palestine by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and had settled in [[Egypt]]. The unit served with distinction in the [[Battle of Gallipoli]]. When the Zion Mule Corps was disbanded, Jabotinsky travelled to London, where he continued his efforts to establish Jewish units to fight in Palestine as part of the [[British Army]]. Although Jabotinsky did not serve with the Zion Mule Corps, Trumpeldor, Jabotinsky and 120 Zion Mule Corps members did serve in Platoon 16 of the [[20th Battalion, London Regiment (Blackheath and Woolwich)|20th Battalion]] of the [[London Regiment]]. In 1917, the government agreed to establish three Jewish battalions, initiating the [[Jewish Legion]].\n\nAs an honorary lieutenant in the 38th [[Royal Fusiliers]], Jabotinsky saw action in Palestine in 1918.<ref name=Schechtman1>{{cite book |pages=[https://archive.org/details/rebelandstatesma006978mbp/page/n288 268]\u2013271 |title=Rebel and Statesman; the Vladimir Jabotinsky Story |url=https://archive.org/details/rebelandstatesma006978mbp |author=Joseph Schechtman |place=New York |publisher=Thomas Yoseloff |year=1956}}</ref> His battalion was one of the first to enter Transjordan.<ref name=Schechtman1/>\n\nHe was demobilized in September 1919,<ref>{{London Gazette| issue=31619 |page=13126 |date=24 October 1919}}</ref> soon after he complained to [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|Field Marshal Allenby]] about the British Army's attitude towards Zionism and the Jewish Legion.<ref>Schechtman (1956), pp. 279\u2013282.</ref> His appeals to the British government failed to reverse the decision but in December 1919<ref>{{London Gazette| issue=31684|page=15455|date=9 December 1919}}</ref> he was appointed a Member of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) for his service.<ref>Schechtman (1956), pp. 283\u2013284.</ref>\n\n==Jewish self-defense in Palestine==\nAfter Ze'ev Jabotinsky was discharged from the British Army in September 1919, he openly trained Jews in warfare and the use of small arms. On 6 April 1920, during the [[1920 Palestine riots]] the British searched the offices and apartments of the Zionist leadership for arms, including the home of [[Chaim Weizmann]], and in a building used by Jabotinsky's defence forces they found three rifles, two pistols, and 250 rounds of ammunition.\n\nNineteen men were arrested. The next day Jabotinsky protested to the police that he was their commander and therefore solely responsible, so they, should be released. Instead, he was arrested and joined them in jail, the nineteen were sentenced to three years in prison and Jabotinsky was given a 15-year prison term for possession of weapons, until the month of July when a general pardon was granted to Jews and Arabs convicted in the rioting.<ref>Zev Golan,'' Free Jerusalem'', pp. 28\u201331</ref>\n \nA committee of inquiry placed responsibility for the riots on the [[Zionist Commission]], alleging that they provoked the Arabs. The court blamed \"[[Bolshevism]]\" claiming that it \"flowed in Zionism's inner heart\", and ironically identified the fiercely anti-socialist Jabotinsky with the socialist-aligned [[Poalei Zion]] ('Zionist Workers') party, which is called 'a definite Bolshevist institution.'<ref name=\"Segev\">[[Tom Segev]], ''One Palestine, Complete'', Metropolitan Books, 1999. p.141</ref>\n\n==Founder of the Revisionist movement==\n[[Image:Hatzohar_Conference._1925-1929_(id.15232546).jpg|thumb|right|Ze'ev Jabotinsky at a [[Hatzohar]] Conference (likely in Paris, in the second half of the 1920s)]]\n\nIn 1920, Jabotinsky was elected to the first [[Assembly of Representatives (Mandate Palestine)|Assembly of Representatives]] in Palestine.

His main goal was to establish a modern Jewish state with the help of the British Empire. His philosophy contrasted with that of the socialist-oriented [[Labor Zionism|Labor Zionists]], in that it focused its economic and social policy on the ideals of the Jewish middle class in Europe. His ideal for a Jewish state was a form of nation state-based loosely on the British imperial model.<ref>'England is becoming continental! Not long ago the prestige of the English ruler of the \"coloured\" colonies stood very high. Hindus, Arabs, Malays were conscious of his superiority and obeyed, not unprotestingly, yet completely. The whole scheme of training of the future rulers was built on the principle \"carry yourself so that the inferior will feel your unobtainable superiority in every motion\".\u2019 Jabotinsky, cited by [[Lenni Brenner]], ''The Iron Wall'' London, ch.7, 1984</ref> His support base was mostly located in Poland, and his activities focused on attaining British support to help with the development of the [[Yishuv]]. Another area of major support for Jabotinsky was [[Latvia]], where his speeches in Russian made an impression on the largely Russian-speaking Latvian Jewish community.\n\nJabotinsky was both a [[nationalist]] and a [[liberal democrat]]. Despite his attachment to nationalism, he did not embrace authoritarian notions of state authority and its imposition on individual liberty; he said that \"Every man is a king.\" He championed the notion of a [[Freedom of the press|free press]] and believed the new Jewish state would protect the rights and interests of minorities. As an [[economic liberal]], he supported a free market with minimal government intervention, but also believed that the \"'elementary necessities' of the average person...: food, shelter, clothing, the opportunity to educate his children, and medical aid in case of illness\" should be supplied by the state.<ref name=\"idi\" />\n\n==Literary career==\nIn 1898, Jabotinsky was sent to Rome as a correspondent for ''Odessky Listok,'' writing columns under the pen name \"V.

Bottom left [[Menachem Begin]] (probably 1939).]]\n\nDuring the 1930s, Jabotinsky was deeply concerned with the situation of the [[Ashkenazi Jews|Jewish community in Eastern Europe]]. In 1936, Jabotinsky prepared the so-called \"evacuation plan\", which called for the evacuation of the entire Jewish population of [[Poland]], [[Hungary]] and [[Romania]] to Palestine.\n\nThe same year he toured [[Eastern Europe]], meeting with the Polish Foreign Minister, Colonel [[J\u00f3zef Beck]]; the Regent of [[Hungary]], Admiral [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]]; and Prime Minister [[Gheorghe T\u0103t\u0103rescu]] of [[Romania]] to discuss the evacuation plan. The plan gained the approval of all three governments, but caused considerable controversy within the [[Polish Jews|Jewish community of Poland]], on the grounds that it played into the hands of anti-Semites. In particular, the fact that the 'evacuation plan' had the approval of the Polish government was taken by many Polish Jews as indicating Jabotinsky had gained the endorsement of what they considered to be the wrong people.\n\nThe evacuation of [[History of the Jews in Poland|Jewish communities in Poland]], [[History of the Jews in Hungary|Hungary]] and [[History of the Jews in Romania|Romania]] was to take place over a ten-year period. However, the British government vetoed it, and the [[World Zionist Organization]]'s chairman, [[Chaim Weizmann]], dismissed it. Two years later, in 1938, Jabotinsky stated in a speech that [[Polish jews|Polish Jews]] were \"living on the edge of the volcano\", and warned that a wave of [[pogroms]] would happen in Poland sometime in the near future. \"Catastrophe is approaching. ... I see a terrible picture ... the volcano that will soon spew out its flames of extermination,\" he said.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.jpost.com/Opinion/MIDDLE-ISRAEL-No-place-for-a-Jew-552833 |title=MIDDLE ISRAEL: No place for a Jew |date=28 April 2018 |author=Amotz Asa-El |work=Jerusalem Post}}</ref> Jabotinsky went on to warn Jews in Europe that they should leave for Palestine as soon as possible.<ref>[http://www.thetower.org/article/jabotinskys-lost-moment-june-1940/ Jabotinsky lost moment 1940]</ref> There is much discussion about whether or not Jabotinsky actually predicted the Holocaust. In his writings and public appearances, he warned against the dangers of an outbreak of violence against the Jewish population of Central and Eastern Europe. However, as late as August 1939, he was certain that war would be averted.<ref>{{cite book|first=Laurence |last=Weinbaum|title=Jabotinsky and Jedwabne|publisher=Midstream |year=April 2004|url= HTTP://www.thefreelibrary.com/Jabotinsky+and+Jedwabne.-a0116037880}}</ref>\n\n==Plan for a revolt against the British==\nIn 1939, Britain enacted the [[White Paper of 1939|MacDonald White Paper]], in which Jewish immigration to Palestine under the British Mandate was to be restricted to 75,000 for the next five years, after which further Jewish immigration would depend on Arab consent. In addition, land sales to Jews were to be restricted, and Palestine would be cultivated for independence as a binational state.\n\nJabotinsky reacted by proposing a plan for an armed Jewish revolt in Palestine. He sent the plan to the [[Irgun]] High Command in six coded letters. Jabotinsky proposed that he and other \"illegals\" would arrive by boat in the heart of Palestine \u2013 preferably [[Tel Aviv]] \u2013 in October 1939. The Irgun would ensure that they successfully landed and escaped, by whatever means necessary. They would then occupy key centers of British power in Palestine, chief among them Government House in Jerusalem, raise the Jewish national flag, and fend off the British for at least 24 hours whatever the cost. Zionist leaders in Western Europe and the United States would then declare an independent Jewish state and would function as a provisional government-in-exile. Although Irgun commanders were impressed by the plan, they were concerned over the heavy losses they would doubtless incur in carrying it out. [[Avraham Stern]] proposed simultaneously landing 40,000 armed young immigrants in Palestine to help launch the uprising. The Polish government supported his plan, and it began training Irgun members and supplying them arms. Irgun submitted the plan for the approval of its commander [[David Raziel]], who was imprisoned by the British. However, the beginning of [[World War II]] in September 1939 quickly put an end to these plans.<ref>Penkower, Monty Noam: ''Decision on Palestine Deferred: America, Britain and Wartime Diplomacy, 1939-1945''</ref><ref>Golan, Zev: ''Free Jerusalem'' pp. 153, 168</ref>\n\n==Integrated state with Arabs==\nAccording to the historian [[Benny Morris]], documents show that Jabotinsky favoured the idea of the transfer of Arab populations if required for establishing a (still-proposed) Jewish state.<ref name=\"morris\">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/jan/14/israel |title=For the record |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |last=Morris |first=Benny |date=13 January 2004 |accessdate=15 June 2013}}</ref> Jabotinsky's other writings state, \"We do not want to eject even one Arab from either the left or the right bank of the [[Jordan River]].

He was a member of the Russian Society of Sailing and Trade and was primarily involved in wheat trading. His mother, Chava (Eva Markovna) Zach (1835\u20131926), came from [[Berdychiv]], [[Kiev Governorate]]. Jabotinsky's older brother Myron died when Vladimir was six months old, and his father died when he was six years old. His sister, Tereza (Tamara Yevgenyevna) Zhabotinskaya-Kopp, founded a private [[Gymnasium (school)|school]] for girls in Odessa. In 1885, the family moved to Germany due to his father's illness, returning a year later after his father's death.\n\nRaised in a middle-class Jewish home, Jabotinsky was educated in Russian schools. Although he studied Hebrew as a child, he wrote in his autobiography that his upbringing was divorced from [[Judaism|Jewish faith]] and tradition. His mother ran a stationary store in Odessa. Jabotinsky dropped out of school at the age of 17 with a guarantee of a job as a correspondent for a local Odessan newspaper,{{sfn|Halkin|2014|pp=16\u201317}} the ''Odesskiy Listok'', and was sent to [[Bern]] and [[Rome]] as a correspondent.

Because of Russian Easter, the newspapers had not been issued for the previous two days so that we remained without any news from the rest of the world. That night the Jewish audience assembled in the Beseda Club, to listen to the talk of a young Zionist, the Odessa 'wunderkind' V. Jabotinsky [\u2026.] The young agitator had great success with his audience. In a particularly moving manner, he drew on Pinsker's parable of the Jew as a shadow wandering through space and developed it further. As for my own impression, this one-sided treatment of our historical problem depressed me: Did he not scarcely stop short of inducing fear in our unstable Jewish youth of their own national shadow?\u2026 During the break, while pacing up and down in the neighboring room, I noticed sudden unrest in the audience: the news spread that fugitives had arrived in Odessa from nearby Kishinev and had reported of a bloody pogrom in progress there.\"</ref> With more pogroms looming on the horizon, he established the Jewish Self-Defense Organization, a Jewish militant group, to safeguard Jewish communities throughout Russia. He became the source of great controversy in the Russian Jewish community as a result of these actions.\n\nAround this time, he began learning [[modern Hebrew]], and took a Hebrew name: ''Vladimir'' became ''Ze'ev'' (\"wolf\"). During the pogroms, he organized self-defense units in [[Jewish]] communities across Russia and fought for the [[civil rights]] of the Jewish population as a whole. His slogan was, \"Better to have a gun and not need it than to need it and not have it!\" Another slogan was, \"Jewish youth, learn to shoot!\"\n\nIn 1903, he was elected as a Russian delegate to the Sixth [[Zionist Congress]] in Basel, Switzerland. After [[Theodore Herzl]]'s death in 1904, he became the leader of the right-wing Zionists. That year he moved to [[Saint Petersburg]] and became one of the co-editors for the Russophone magazine ''Yevreiskaya Zhyzn'' (Jewish Life), which after 1907 became the official publishing body of the Zionist movement in Russia. In the pages of the newspaper, Jabotinsky wrote fierce polemics against supporters of assimilation and the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bund]].\n\nIn 1905, he was one of the co-founders of the \"Union for Rights Equality of Jewish People in Russia\". The following year, he was one of the chief speakers at the 3rd All-Russian Conference of Zionists in [[Helsinki]] (Helsingfors), which called upon the Jews of Europe to engage in ''Gegenwartsarbeit'' (work in the present) and to join together to demand autonomy for ethnic minorities in Russia.<ref name=\"liberal.org.il\">{{cite web|url=http://www.liberal.org.il/the_man.htm |title=Jabotinsky Ze'ev.

Jabotinsky became editor-in-chief of a new pro-Young-Turkish daily newspaper ''Jeune Turc'', which was founded and financed by Zionist officials like WZO president [[David Wolffsohn]] and his representative in Constantinople Victor Jacobson. The journalists writing for that paper included the famous German Social democrat and Russian-Jewish revolutionary [[Parvus]], who lived in Constantinople from 1910 until 1914. The ''Jeune Turc'' was prohibited in 1915 by the pro-German Turkish military junta. Richard Lichtheim, who was to become Jabotinsky's representative in Germany in 1925, stayed in Constantinople as WZO representative and managed to keep the \"Yishuv\" out of trouble during the war years by constant diplomatic interventions with Germans, Turks, and also US authorities, whose humanitarian support was crucial for the survival of the Jewish settlement project in Palestine during the war years.<ref>For references, see Richard Lichtheims autobiographical books in Hebrew and German (see the Hebrew Wikipedia entry of Richard Lichtheim)</ref>\n\n==Military career==\n[[File:ZEEV JABOTINSKY IN ARMY UNIFORM DURING WORLD WAR 1. \u05e4\u05d5\u05e8\u05d8\u05e8\u05d8, \u05d6\u05d0\u05d1 \u05d6'\u05d1\u05d5\u05d8\u05d9\u05e0\u05e1\u05e7\u05d9 \u05d1\u05de\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd \u05e6\u05d1\u05d0\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd, \u05d1\u05d6\u05de\u05df \u05de\u05dc\u05d7\u05de\u05ea \u05d4\u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd \u05d4\u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d5\u05e0\u05d4.D850-054.jpg|thumb|right|Ze'ev Jabotinsky served in platoon 16 of the [[20th Battalion, London Regiment (Blackheath and Woolwich)|20th Battalion]] of the [[London Regiment]] between 1916 and 1917]]\n[[File:Jabotinsky_in_Jewish_Legion.jpg|thumb|right|Lt Jabotinsky in the uniform of the Royal Fusiliers]]\n[[File:\u05e2\u05d9\u05d8\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05e6\u05d1\u05d0\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd \u05e9\u05dc \u05d6\u05d0\u05d1 \u05d6'\u05d1\u05d5\u05d8\u05d9\u05e0\u05e1\u05e7\u05d9.jpg|thumb|Miniatures of the [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]], [[British War Medal]] and [[Victory Medal (United Kingdom)|Victory Medal]] awarded to Jabotinsky]]\n[[File:AJI view 20121204 141410.jpg|thumb|right|Testimonial to Jabotinsky from the 38th Battalion Royal Fusiliers]]\n\nDuring World War I, he had the idea of establishing a Jewish Legion to fight alongside the British against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] who then controlled [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. In 1915, together with [[Joseph Trumpeldor]], a one-armed veteran of the [[Russo-Japanese War]], he created the [[Zion Mule Corps]], which consisted of several hundred Jewish men, mainly Russians who had been exiled from Palestine by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and had settled in [[Egypt]]. The unit served with distinction in the [[Battle of Gallipoli]]. When the Zion Mule Corps was disbanded, Jabotinsky traveled to London, where he continued his efforts to establish Jewish units to fight in Palestine as part of the [[British Army]]. Although Jabotinsky did not serve with the Zion Mule Corps, Trumpeldor, Jabotinsky and 120 Zion Mule Corps members did serve in Platoon 16 of the [[20th Battalion, London Regiment (Blackheath and Woolwich)|20th Battalion]] of the [[London Regiment]]. In 1917, the government agreed to establish three Jewish battalions, initiating the [[Jewish Legion]].\n\nAs an honorary lieutenant in the 38th [[Royal Fusiliers]], Jabotinsky saw action in Palestine in 1918.<ref name=Schechtman1>{{cite book |pages=[https://archive.org/details/rebelandstatesma006978mbp/page/n288 268]\u2013271 |title=Rebel and Statesman; the Vladimir Jabotinsky Story |url=https://archive.org/details/rebelandstatesma006978mbp |author=Joseph Schechtman |place=New York |publisher=Thomas Yoseloff |year=1956}}</ref> His battalion was one of the first to enter Transjordan.<ref name=Schechtman1/>\n\nHe was demobilised in September 1919,<ref>{{London Gazette| issue=31619 |page=13126 |date=24 October 1919}}</ref> soon after he complained to [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|Field Marshal Allenby]] about the British Army's attitude towards Zionism and the Jewish Legion.<ref>Schechtman (1956), pp. 279\u2013282.</ref> His appeals to the British government failed to reverse the decision, but in December 1919<ref>{{London Gazette| issue=31684|page=15455|date=9 December 1919}}</ref> he was appointed a Member of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) for his service.<ref>Schechtman (1956), pp. 283\u2013284.</ref>\n\n==Jewish self-defense in Palestine==\nAfter Ze'ev Jabotinsky was discharged from the British Army in September 1919, he openly trained Jews in warfare and the use of small arms. On 6 April 1920, during the [[1920 Palestine riots]] the British searched the offices and apartments of the Zionist leadership for arms, including the home of [[Chaim Weizmann]], and in a building used by Jabotinsky's defense forces they found three rifles, two pistols, and 250 rounds of ammunition.\n\nNineteen men were arrested. The next day Jabotinsky protested to the police that he was their commander and therefore solely responsible, so they, should be released. Instead, he was arrested and joined them in jail, the nineteen were sentenced to three years in prison and Jabotinsky was given a 15-year prison term for possession of weapons, until the month of July when a general pardon was granted to Jews and Arabs convicted in the rioting.<ref>Zev Golan,''Free Jerusalem'', pp. 28\u201331</ref>\n \nA committee of inquiry placed responsibility for the riots on the [[Zionist Commission]], alleging that they provoked the Arabs. The court blamed \"[[Bolshevism]]\" claiming that it \"flowed in Zionism's inner heart\", and ironically identified the fiercely anti-socialist Jabotinsky with the socialist-aligned [[Poalei Zion]] ('Zionist Workers') party, which it called 'a definite Bolshevist institution.'<ref name=\"Segev\">[[Tom Segev]], ''One Palestine, Complete'', Metropolitan Books, 1999. p.141</ref>\n\n==Founder of the Revisionist movement==\n[[Image:Hatzohar_Conference._1925-1929_(id.15232546).jpg|thumb|right|Ze'ev Jabotinsky at a [[Hatzohar]] Conference (likely in Paris, in the second half of the 1920s)]]\n\nIn 1920, Jabotinsky was elected to the first [[Assembly of Representatives (Mandate Palestine)|Assembly of Representatives]] in Palestine. The following year he was elected to the executive council of the [[World Zionist Organization|Zionist Organization]]. He was also a founder of the newly registered [[Keren Hayesod|Keren haYesod]] and served as its director of propaganda.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kh-uia.org.il/us/history.html |title=Keren Hayesod |accessdate=10 December 2009 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928041617/http://www.kh-uia.org.il/us/history.html |archivedate=28 September 2007}}</ref> Jabotinsky left the mainstream Zionist movement in 1923 due to differences of opinion between him and its chairman, [[Chaim Weizmann]], establishing a new [[Revisionist Zionism|revisionist]] party called [[Hatzohar|Alliance of Revisionists-Zionists]] and its [[Zionist youth movement|youth movement]], [[Betar (youth movement)|Betar]] (a Hebrew acronym for the \"League of Joseph Trumpeldor\").\n\nHis new party demanded that the mainstream Zionist movement recognize as its stated objective the establishment of a Jewish state on both banks of the [[Jordan River]]. His main goal was to establish a modern Jewish state with the help of the British Empire. His philosophy contrasted with that of the socialist oriented [[Labor Zionism|Labor Zionists]], in that it focused its economic and social policy on the ideals of the Jewish middle class in Europe. His ideal for a Jewish state was a form of nation state based loosely on the British imperial model.<ref>'England is becoming continental! Not long ago the prestige of the English ruler of the \"colored\" colonies stood very high. Hindus, Arabs, Malays were conscious of his superiority and obeyed, not unprotestingly, yet completely. The whole scheme of training of the future rulers was built on the principle \"carry yourself so that the inferior will feel your unobtainable superiority in every motion\".\u2019 Jabotinsky, cited by [[Lenni Brenner]], ''The Iron Wall'' London, ch.7, 1984</ref> His support base was mostly located in Poland, and his activities focused on attaining British support to help with the development of the [[Yishuv]]. Another area of major support for Jabotinsky was [[Latvia]], where his speeches in Russian made an impression on the largely Russian-speaking Latvian Jewish community.\n\nJabotinsky was both a [[nationalist]] and a [[liberal democrat]]. Despite his attachment to nationalism, he did not embrace authoritarian notions of state authority and its imposition on individual liberty; he said that \"Every man is a king.\" He championed the notion of a [[Freedom of the press|free press]] and believed the new Jewish state would protect the rights and interests of minorities. As an [[economic liberal]], he supported a free market with minimal government intervention, but also believed that the \"'elementary necessities' of the average person...: food, shelter, clothing, the opportunity to educate his children, and medical aid in case of illness\" should be supplied by the state.<ref name=\"idi\" />\n\n==Literary career==\nIn 1898, Jabotinsky was sent to Rome as a correspondent for ''Odessky Listok,'' writing columns under the pen name \"V. Egal, \"Vl. Egal\" \"V.E.\" for more than a year. His first application for a job at ''Odesskiya Novosti'' was turned down, but after the editor, J.M. Heifetz, saw his writing for  ''Odessky Listok,'' he hired him. At that point, Jabotinsky changed his pen name to ''Altalena,'' which he confesses was a mistake. He thought the Italian word meant \"elevator,\" but explained to the editor that the real meaning, \"swing,\" suited him well, since he was \"'by no means stable or constant', but rather rocking and balancing.\"<ref>[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=Ox8KULil0qkC&pg=PA58&lpg=PA58&dq=jabotinsky+all+my+life+is+a+swing&source=bl&ots=UcgY0UrrDu&sig=ACfU3U0fQNNcvKzQVGMW6T93wjBi0-YkMw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjhrZ_t9PDlAhUjuaQKHVBTBsAQ6AEwAHoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=jabotinsky%20all%20my%20life%20is%20a%20swing&f=false The Life and Times of Vladimir Jabotinsky: Rebel and statesman, Joseph Schechtman]</ref>\n \nIn 1914, Jabotinsky published the first [[Hebrew]] translation of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s poems ''[[The Raven]]'' and ''[[Annabel Lee]]''.<ref>[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=zkLK7khFnYkC&pg=PR16&lpg=PR16&dq=jabotinsky+translation+the+raven&source=bl&ots=_S14A6GZ_k&sig=ACfU3U3tmTNi2jMsCfvki3yge50foJoutA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjsu_zr8OnlAhXOblAKHXRaBfgQ6AEwCHoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=jabotinsky%20translation%20the%20raven&f=false Hebrew Gothic: History and the Poetics of Persecution, Karen Grumberg]</ref>\n\nFrom 1923, Jabotinsky was editor of the revived Jewish weekly ''Rassvet'' (Dawn), published first in Berlin, then in Paris. Besides his journalistic work, he published novels under his previous pseudonym Altalena; his historical novel ''Samson Nazorei'' (Samson the [[Nazirite]], 1927), set in Biblical times, describes Jabotinsky's ideal of an active, daring, warrior form of Jewish life. His novel ''Pyatero'' (''The Five'', written 1935, published 1936) has been described as \"a work that probably has the truest claim to being the great Odessa novel. ...

Bottom left [[Menachem Begin]] (probably 1939).]]\n\nDuring the 1930s, Jabotinsky was deeply concerned with the situation of the [[Ashkenazi Jews|Jewish community in Eastern Europe]]. In 1936, Jabotinsky prepared the so-called \"evacuation plan\", which called for the evacuation of the entire Jewish population of [[Poland]], [[Hungary]] and [[Romania]] to Palestine.\n\nThe same year he toured [[Eastern Europe]], meeting with the Polish Foreign Minister, Colonel [[J\u00f3zef Beck]]; the Regent of [[Hungary]], Admiral [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]]; and Prime Minister [[Gheorghe T\u0103t\u0103rescu]] of [[Romania]] to discuss the evacuation plan. The plan gained the approval of all three governments, but caused considerable controversy within the [[Polish Jews|Jewish community of Poland]], on the grounds that it played into the hands of anti-Semites. In particular, the fact that the 'evacuation plan' had the approval of the Polish government was taken by many Polish Jews as indicating Jabotinsky had gained the endorsement of what they considered to be the wrong people.\n\nThe evacuation of [[History of the Jews in Poland|Jewish communities in Poland]], [[History of the Jews in Hungary|Hungary]] and [[History of the Jews in Romania|Romania]] was to take place over a ten-year period. However, the British government vetoed it, and the [[World Zionist Organization]]'s chairman, [[Chaim Weizmann]], dismissed it. Two years later, in 1938, Jabotinsky stated in a speech that [[Polish jews|Polish Jews]] were \"living on the edge of the volcano\", and warned that a wave of [[pogroms]] would happen in Poland sometime in the near future. \"Catastrophe is approaching. ... I see a terrible picture ... the volcano that will soon spew out its flames of extermination,\" he said.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.jpost.com/Opinion/MIDDLE-ISRAEL-No-place-for-a-Jew-552833 |title=MIDDLE ISRAEL: No place for a Jew |date=28 April 2018 |author=Amotz Asa-El |work=Jerusalem Post}}</ref> Jabotinsky went on to warn Jews in Europe that they should leave for Palestine as soon as possible.<ref>[http://www.thetower.org/article/jabotinskys-lost-moment-june-1940/ Jabotinsky lost moment 1940]</ref> There is much discussion about whether or not Jabotinsky actually predicted the Holocaust. In his writings and public appearances he warned against the dangers of an outbreak of violence against the Jewish population of Central and Eastern Europe. However, as late as August 1939, he was certain that war would be averted.<ref>{{cite book|first=Laurence |last=Weinbaum|title=Jabotinsky and Jedwabne|publisher=Midstream |year=April 2004|url= http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Jabotinsky+and+Jedwabne.-a0116037880}}</ref>\n\n==Plan for a revolt against the British==\nIn 1939, Britain enacted the [[White Paper of 1939|MacDonald White Paper]], in which Jewish immigration to Palestine under the British Mandate was to be restricted to 75,000 for the next five years, after which further Jewish immigration would depend on Arab consent. In addition, land sales to Jews were to be restricted, and Palestine would be cultivated for independence as a binational state.\n\nJabotinsky reacted by proposing a plan for an armed Jewish revolt in Palestine. He sent the plan to the [[Irgun]] High Command in six coded letters. Jabotinsky proposed that he and other \"illegals\" would arrive by boat in the heart of Palestine \u2013 preferably [[Tel Aviv]] \u2013 in October 1939. The Irgun would ensure that they successfully landed and escaped, by whatever means necessary. They would then occupy key centers of British power in Palestine, chief among them Government House in Jerusalem, raise the Jewish national flag, and fend off the British for at least 24 hours whatever the cost. Zionist leaders in Western Europe and the United States would then declare an independent Jewish state, and would function as a provisional government-in-exile. Although Irgun commanders were impressed by the plan, they were concerned over the heavy losses they would doubtless incur in carrying it out. [[Avraham Stern]] proposed simultaneously landing 40,000 armed young immigrants in Palestine to help launch the uprising. The Polish government supported his plan, and it began training Irgun members and supplying them arms. Irgun submitted the plan for the approval of its commander [[David Raziel]], who was imprisoned by the British. However, the beginning of [[World War II]] in September 1939 quickly put an end to these plans.<ref>Penkower, Monty Noam: ''Decision on Palestine Deferred: America, Britain and Wartime Diplomacy, 1939-1945''</ref><ref>Golan, Zev: ''Free Jerusalem'' pp. 153, 168</ref>\n\n==Integrated state with Arabs==\nAccording to the historian [[Benny Morris]], documents show that Jabotinsky favored the idea of the transfer of Arab populations if required for establishing a (still-proposed) Jewish state.<ref name=\"morris\">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/jan/14/israel |title=For the record |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |last=Morris |first=Benny |date=13 January 2004 |accessdate=15 June 2013}}</ref> Jabotinsky's other writings state, \"We do not want to eject even one Arab from either the left or the right bank of the [[Jordan River]].

After 1945 the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|socialist]] government under [[Josip Broz Tito]] systematically repressed all manifestations of [[nationalism]] throughout Yugoslavia, seeking to ensure that no republic or nationality gained dominance over the others. In particular, Tito diluted the power of [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|Serbia]]\u2014the largest and most populous republic\u2014by establishing autonomous governments in the Serbian province of [[Vojvodina]] in the north and [[Autonomous Region of Kosovo and Metohija (1945-1963)|Kosovo and Metohija]] in the south. Kosovo's borders did not precisely match the areas of ethnic Albanian settlement in Yugoslavia (significant numbers of Albanians remained in the [[Albanians in the Republic of Macedonia|Socialist Republic of Macedonia]], [[Albanians in Montenegro|Montenegro]] and [[Albanians in Serbia|Serbia]]). Kosovo's formal autonomy, established under the 1945 Yugoslav constitution, initially meant relatively little in practice. The [[UDBA|secret police]] (the UDBA) cracked down hard on nationalists. In 1956 a number of [[Albanians]] went on trial in Kosovo on charges of espionage and subversion. The threat of separatism was in fact minimal, as the few underground groups aiming for union with [[Albania]] had little political significance. Their long-term impact became substantial, though, as some\u2014particularly the Revolutionary Movement for Albanian Unity, founded{{when|date=October 2014}} by [[Adem Dema\u00e7i]]\u2014would eventually form the political core of the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] (founded in 1990). Demaci himself was imprisoned in 1964 along with many of his followers. Yugoslavia underwent a period of economic and political crisis in 1969, as a massive government program of economic reform widened the gap between the rich north and poor south of the country.\n\nStudent demonstrations and riots in [[Belgrade]] in June 1968 spread to Kosovo in November, but Yugoslav security forces quelled them. Tito conceded some of the students' demands\u2014in particular, representative powers for Albanians in both the Serbian and Yugoslav state bodies and better recognition of the [[Albanian language]]. The [[University of Pristina (1969\u201399)|University of Pristina]] was established as an independent institution in 1970, ending a long period when the institution had been run as an outpost of [[Belgrade University]]. The lack of Albanian-language educational materials in Yugoslavia hampered Albanian education in Kosovo, so an agreement was struck with [[Socialist People's Republic of Albania|Albania]] itself to supply textbooks.\n\nIn 1969 the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] ordered its clergy to compile data on the ongoing problems of [[Serbs of Kosovo|Serbs in Kosovo]], seeking to pressure the government in Belgrade to do more to protect the interests of Serbs there.<ref>https://www.britannica.com/event/Kosovo-conflict</ref>\n\nIn 1974 Kosovo's political status improved further when a new Yugoslav constitution granted an expanded set of political rights. Along with [[Socialist Province of Vojvodina|Vojvodina]], Kosovo was [[Socialist Province of Kosovo|declared a province]] and gained many of the powers of a fully-fledged republic: a seat on the [[Presidency of Yugoslavia|federal presidency]] and its own assembly, police force and national bank.<ref>{{cite book|last=Judah|first=Tim|authorlink=Tim Judah|title=Kosovo: War and Revenge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sVf1na3FN_UC |accessdate=26 Nov 2012|year=2000|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven and London|isbn=978-0-300-08313-2|page=38}}</ref>\n\n===After the death of Tito (1980\u201386)===\nProvincial power was still exercised by the Communist Party, but now devolved mainly to ethnic Albanian communists. Tito's death on 4 May 1980 ushered in a long period of political instability, worsened by growing economic crisis and nationalist unrest. The first major outbreak occurred in Kosovo's main city, [[Pristina]], when a protest of University of Pristina students over long queues in their university canteen rapidly escalated and in late March and early April 1981 spread throughout Kosovo, causing [[1981 protests in Kosovo|mass demonstrations]] in several towns. The disturbances were quelled by the Presidency of Yugoslavia proclaiming a state of emergency, sending in riot police and the army, which resulted in numerous casualties.\n\nCommunist hard-liners instituted a fierce crackdown on nationalism of all kinds. Kosovo endured a heavy secret-police presence throughout most of the 1980s that ruthlessly suppressed any unauthorised nationalist manifestations, both Albanian and Serbian. According to a report quoted by [[Mark Thompson (reporter)|Mark Thompson]], as many as 580,000 inhabitants of Kosovo were arrested, interrogated, interned or reprimanded. Thousands of these lost their jobs or were expelled from their educational establishments. During this time tension between the Albanian and Serbian communities continued to escalate.\n\nIn February 1982 a group of priests from Serbia proper petitioned their bishops to ask \"why the Serbian Church is silent\" and why it did not campaign against \"the destruction, arson and sacrilege of the holy shrines of Kosovo\". Such concerns did attract interest in Belgrade. Stories appeared from time to time in the Belgrade media claiming that Serbs and Montenegrins were being persecuted. There was a perception among Serbian nationalists that Serbs were being driven out of Kosovo.\n\nIn addition to all this, the worsening state of Kosovo's economy made the province a poor choice for Serbs seeking work. Albanians, as well as Serbs, tended to favor their compatriots when hiring new employees, but the number of jobs was too few for the population. Kosovo was the poorest entity of Yugoslavia: the average per capita income was $795, compared with the national average of $2,635.\n\nIn 1981 it was reported that some 4,000 Serbs moved from Kosovo to central Serbia after the Kosovo Albanian riots in March that resulted in several Serb deaths and the desecration of Serbian Orthodox architecture and graveyards.<ref>The Associated Press-October 17, 1981 \"Minorities Leaving Yugoslav Province Dominated by Albanians\"</ref> Serbia reacted with a plan to reduce the power of Albanians in the province and a propaganda campaign that claimed Serbs were being pushed out of the province primarily by the growing Albanian population, rather than the bad state of the economy.<ref name=\"Ramet2010\">{{cite book|last=Ramet|first=Sabrina P.|title=Central and Southeast European Politics Since 1989|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oFXdiS25N78C&pg=PA361|accessdate=9 March 2012|date=18 February 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-71616-1|page=361}}</ref> 33 nationalist formations were dismantled by Yugoslav police, who sentenced some 280 people (800 fined, 100 under investigation) and seized arms caches and propaganda material.<ref>''Financial Times'' (London) February 5, 1982\u2013\"Police fail to crush resistance in Kosovo\"</ref>\n\n===Kosovo and the rise of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 (1986\u201390)===\n{{Original research section|date=September 2009}}\nIn 1987 [[David Binder (journalist)|David Binder]] wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'' about the growing ethnic tension in Yugoslavia and rising nationalism among Albanians in Kosovo and referred to the [[Para\u0107in massacre]], where an ethnic Albanian soldier in the JNA killed four fellow soldiers.<ref name=NYDB>''[[The New York Times]]'', November 1, 1987, Late City Final Edition (p.14) -\"[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/01/world/in-yugoslavia-rising-ethnic-strife-brings-fears-of-worse-civil-conflict.html In Yugoslavia, Rising Ethnic Strife Brings Fears of Worse Civil Conflict] By David Binder</ref> Binder also\u2014writing of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107's deposing of [[Dragi\u0161a Pavlovi\u0107]] as head of Belgrade's party organisation shortly before\u2014wrote that \"Mr. Milosevic accused Mr. Pavlovic of being an appeaser who was soft on Albanian radicals\", and that \"Mr. Milosevic and his supporters appear to be staking their careers on a strategy of confrontation with the Kosovo ethnic Albanians\".<ref name=NYDB/> The article quotes the Federal Secretary for National Defence, Fleet Adm.

Mamula had also said that ethnic Albanian subversives had been preparing for \"killing officers and soldiers, poisoning food and water, sabotage, breaking into weapons arsenals and stealing arms and ammunition, desertion and causing flagrant nationalist incidents in army units\".<ref name=NYDB />\n\nIn Kosovo an increasingly poisonous atmosphere between Serbs and Albanians led to wild rumors being spread and otherwise trivial incidents being blown out of proportion. It was against this tense background that the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] (SANU) conducted a survey of Serbs who had left Kosovo in 1985 and 1986, which concluded that a considerable number had left under pressure from Albanians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snd-us.com/history/Petrovic-Blagojevic/index.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010523033457/http://www.snd-us.com/history/Petrovic-Blagojevic/index.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2001-05-23 |title=The Migration of Serbs and Montenegrins from Kosovo and Metohija |year=2000 |publisher=Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts |author=Ruza Petrovic, [[Marina Blagojevic]] |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe so-called [[SANU Memorandum]], leaked in September 1986, was a draft document that focused on the political difficulties facing Serbs in Yugoslavia, pointing to Tito's deliberate hobbling of Serbia's power and the difficulties faced by Serbs outside [[Serbia proper]]. It paid special attention to Kosovo, arguing that the Kosovo Serbs were being subjected to \"physical, political, legal and cultural genocide\" in an \"open and total war\" that had been ongoing since the spring of 1981. It claimed that Kosovo's status in 1986 was a worse historical defeat for the Serbs than any event since liberation from the Ottomans in 1804, thus ranking it above such catastrophes as the World war occupations. The Memorandum's authors claimed that 200,000 Serbs had moved out of the province over the previous 20 years and warned that there would soon be none left \"unless things change radically.\" The remedy, according to the Memorandum, was for \"genuine security and unambiguous equality for all peoples living in Kosovo and Metohija [to be] established\" and \"objective and permanent conditions for the return of the expelled [Serbian] nation [to be] created.\" It concluded that \"Serbia must not be passive and wait and see what the others will say, as it has done so often in the past.\" The SANU Memorandum provoked split reactions: Albanians saw it as a call for Serbian supremacy at the local level, claiming the Serb emigrants had left Kosovo for economic reasons, while the Slovenes and Croats saw a threat in the call for a more assertive Serbia. Serbs were divided: many welcomed it, while the Communist old guard strongly attacked its message. One of those who denounced it was Serbian Communist Party official [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]].\n\nIn November 1988 Kosovo's head of the provincial committee was arrested. In March 1989 Milo\u0161evi\u0107 announced an \"[[anti-bureaucratic revolution]]\" in Kosovo and Vojvodina, curtailing their autonomy as well as imposing a curfew and a state of emergency in Kosovo due to violent demonstrations, resulting in 24 deaths (including two policemen).

Ultra-nationalist Radical Party chairman [[Vojislav \u0160e\u0161elj]] became a deputy prime minister. This increased the dissatisfaction with the country's position among Western diplomats and spokespersons.\n\nIn early April, Serbia arranged for [[1998 Serbian foreign mediation in Kosovo referendum|a referendum]] on the issue of foreign interference in Kosovo. Serbian voters decisively rejected foreign interference in the crisis.<ref>[http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&id=rs011998 Serbien (Jugoslawien), 23. April 1998 : Internationale Beobachter f\u00fcr Kosovo] Direct Democracy</ref> Meanwhile, the KLA claimed much of the area in and around [[De\u00e7an]] and ran a territory based in the village of Glodjane, encompassing its surroundings. On May 31, 1998, the Yugoslav army and the Serb Ministry of the Interior police began an operation to clear the border of the KLA. NATO's response to this offensive was mid-June's Operation Determined Falcon, a NATO show of force over the Yugoslav borders.<ref>{{cite web|author=John Pike|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/determined_falcon.htm|title=Operation Determined Falcon|publisher=Globalsecurity.org|accessdate=2012-05-06}}</ref>\n\nDuring this time, Yugoslav President Milo\u0161evi\u0107 reached an arrangement with Boris Yeltsin of Russia to stop offensive operations and prepare for talks with the Albanians, who refused to talk to the Serbian side throughout the crisis, but would talk with the Yugoslav government. In fact, the only meeting between Milo\u0161evi\u0107 and Ibrahim Rugova happened on 15 May in Belgrade, two days after [[Richard Holbrooke]] announced that it would take place. Holbrooke threatened Milo\u0161evi\u0107 that if he did not obey, \"what's left of your country will implode\". A month later, Holbrooke visited the border areas affected by the fighting in early June, where he was famously photographed with the KLA. The publication of these images sent a signal to the KLA, its supporters and sympathisers, and to observers in general, that the US was decisively backing the KLA and the Albanian population in Kosovo.{{fact?|date=February 2017}}\n\nThe Yeltsin agreement required Milo\u0161evi\u0107 to allow international representatives to set up a mission in Kosovo to monitor the situation there. The [[Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission]] (KDOM) began operations in early July 1998. The US government welcomed this part of the agreement, but denounced the initiative's call for a mutual cease fire. Rather, the US demanded that the Serbian-Yugoslavian side should cease fire \"without linkage&nbsp;... to a cessation in terrorist activities\".\n\nAll through June and into mid-July, the KLA maintained its advance. The KLA surrounded [[Pe\u0107]] and [[Gjakova|\u0110akovica]], and set up an interim capital in the town of [[Mali\u0161evo]] (north of [[Orahovac]]). KLA troops infiltrated [[Suva Reka]] and the northwest of Pristina. They moved on to capture the Belacevec coal pits in late June, threatening energy supplies in the region. Their tactics as usual focused mainly on [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] and [[mountain warfare]], and harassing and ambushing Yugoslav forces and Serb police patrols.{{fact?|date=February 2017}}\n\nThe tide turned in mid-July when the KLA captured Orahovac. On 17 July 1998, two nearby villages, Retimlije and Opteru\u0161a, were also captured, while less systematic events took place in the larger Serb-populated village of Velika Ho\u010da. The Orthodox monastery of Zociste {{convert|3|mi|km|spell=in}} from Orehovac\u2014famous for the relics of the Saints Kosmas and Damianos and revered also by local Albanians\u2014was robbed, its monks deported to a KLA prison camp, and, while empty, the monastery church and all its buildings were levelled to the ground by mining. This led to a series of Serb and Yugoslav offensives which would continue into the beginning of August.{{fact?|date=February 2017}}\n\nA new set of KLA attacks in mid-August triggered Yugoslavian operations in south-central Kosovo, south of the Pristina-Pe\u0107 road. This wound down with the capture of [[Kle\u010dka]] on August 23 and the discovery of a KLA-run crematorium in which some of their victims were found. The KLA began an offensive on September 1 around [[Prizren]], causing Yugoslavian military activity there. In western Kosovo, around Pe\u0107, another offensive caused condemnation as international officials expressed fear that a large column of displaced people would be attacked.{{fact?|date=February 2017}}\n\nIn early mid-September, for the first time, KLA activity was reported in northern Kosovo around [[Podujevo]]. Finally, in late September, a determined effort was made to clear the KLA out of the northern and central parts of Kosovo and out of the Drenica valley itself. During this time many threats were made from Western capitals but these were tempered somewhat by the elections in Bosnia, as they did not want Serbian Democrats and Radicals to win. Following the elections, the threats intensified once again, but a galvanising event was needed. They got it on September 28, when [[Gornje Obrinje massacre|the mutilated corpses of a family]] were discovered by KDOM outside the village of Gornje Obrinje. The bloody image of a child's doll and streams of displaced persons rallied the international community to action.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5EFihegRpmkC&pg=PA356|page=356|title=Handbook of Ethnic Conflict: International Perspectives|editor=Dan Landis, Rosita D.

Hill|Christopher Hill]], was leading [[shuttle diplomacy]] between an Albanian delegation, led by Rugova, and the Yugoslav and Serbian authorities. These meetings were shaping the peace plan to be discussed during a period of planned NATO occupation of Kosovo. During a period of two weeks, threats intensified, culminating in NATO's Activation Order being given. NATO was ready to begin airstrikes, and Richard Holbrooke went to Belgrade in the hope of reaching an agreement with Milo\u0161evi\u0107. Officially, the international community demanded an end to fighting. It specifically demanded that Yugoslavia end its offensives against the KLA whilst attempting to convince the KLA to drop its bid for independence. Attempts were made to persuade Milo\u0161evi\u0107 to permit NATO peacekeeping troops to enter Kosovo. This, they argued, would allow for the Christopher Hill peace process to proceed and yield a peace agreement.\n\nOn 13 October 1998, the [[North Atlantic Council]] issued activation orders for the execution of both limited [[air strike]]s and a phased [[aerial warfare|air campaign]] in Yugoslavia which would begin in approximately 96 hours.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Statement to the Press by the Secretary General Following Decision on the ACTORD|date=13 October 1998|publisher=NATO|url=http://www.nato.int/docu/speech/1998/s981013a.htm}}</ref> On 15 October the NATO [[Kosovo Verification Mission]] (KVM) Agreement for a ceasefire was signed, and the deadline for withdrawal was extended to 27 October.<ref name=\"gs_oee\">{{cite web|title=Operation Eagle Eye|publisher=GlobalSecurity.org|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/eagle_eye.htm}}</ref><ref name=\"nato_oaf\">{{cite web|title=Operation Allied Force|publisher=NATO|url=http://www.afsouth.nato.int/archives/operations/detforce/force.htm|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927191114/http://www.afsouth.nato.int/archives/operations/detforce/force.htm|archivedate=2011-09-27|df=}}</ref> Difficulties implementing the agreement were reported, as clashes continued between government troops and the guerrillas.<ref>{{cite web|author=Paul Watson|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1998-10-20/news/9810190342_1_kosovo-liberation-army-serbian-forces-serbian-officials|title=Serb Troops Digging In To Battle Kosovo Rebels|work=Sun Sentinel|date=1998-10-20|accessdate=2012-11-08}}</ref> The Serbian withdrawal commenced on or around 25 October 1998, and [[Operation Eagle Eye (Kosovo)|Operation Eagle Eye]] commenced on 30 October.<ref name=\"gs_oee\" /><ref name=\"nato_oaf\" />\n\nThe KVM was a large contingent of unarmed [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE) peace monitors (officially known as verifiers) that moved into Kosovo.

This massacre was the turning point of the war. [[NATO]] decided that the conflict could only be settled by introducing a military peacekeeping force under the auspices of NATO, to forcibly restrain the two sides.

It also called for a peace conference to be held in February 1999 at the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Rambouillet]], outside Paris.\n\nThe [[Rambouillet Agreement|Rambouillet talks]] began on 6 February 1999, with [[Secretary General of NATO|NATO Secretary General]] [[Javier Solana]] negotiating with both sides. They were intended to conclude by 19 February. The FR Yugoslavian delegation was led by then president of Serbia [[Milan Milutinovi\u0107]], while Milo\u0161evi\u0107 himself remained in Belgrade. This was in contrast to the 1995 [[Dayton Agreement|Dayton conference]] that ended the war in Bosnia, where Milo\u0161evi\u0107 negotiated in person. The absence of Milo\u0161evi\u0107 was interpreted as a sign that the real decisions were being made back in Belgrade, a move that aroused criticism in Yugoslavia as well as abroad; Kosovo's Serbian Orthodox bishop [[Artemije]] traveled all the way to Rambouillet to protest that the delegation was wholly unrepresentative. At this time speculation about an indictment of Milo\u0161evi\u0107 for war crimes was rife, so his absence may have been motivated by fear of arrest.\n\n[[File:72nd Special Brigade equipment 1999, Belgrade Military Museum .jpg|thumb|upright|Equipment of 72nd Special Brigade [[Yugoslav Army (FRY)|Yugoslav Army]] in the 1999 Kosovo War]]\n\nThe first phase of negotiations was successful. In particular, a statement was issued by the Contact Group co-chairmen on 23 February 1999 that the negotiations \"have led to a ''consensus'' on substantial autonomy for Kosovo, including on mechanisms for free and fair elections to democratic institutions, for the governance of Kosovo, for the protection of human rights and the rights of members of national communities; and for the establishment of a fair judicial system\". They went on to say that \"a political framework is now in place\", leaving the further work of finalising \"the implementation Chapters of the Agreement, including the modalities of the ''invited international'' civilian and military presence in Kosovo\".\n\nWhile the accords did not fully satisfy the Albanians, they were much too radical for the Yugoslavs, who responded by substituting a drastically revised text that even Russia (ally of FR Yugoslavia) found unacceptable. It sought to reopen the painstakingly negotiated political status of Kosovo and deleted all of the proposed implementation measures. Among many other changes in the proposed new version, it eliminated the entire chapter on humanitarian assistance and reconstruction, removed virtually all international oversight and dropped any mention of invoking \"the will of the people [of Kosovo]\" in determining the final status of the province.\n\nOn 18 March 1999, the Albanian, US, and British delegations signed what became known as the [[Rambouillet Agreement|Rambouillet Accords]], while the Yugoslav and Russian delegations refused. The accords called for NATO administration of Kosovo as an autonomous province within Yugoslavia, a force of 30,000 NATO troops to maintain order in Kosovo; an unhindered right of passage for NATO troops on Yugoslav territory, including Kosovo; and immunity for NATO and its agents to Yugoslav law. They would have also permitted a continuing Yugoslav army presence of 1,500 troops for border monitoring, backed by up to 1,000 troops to perform command and support functions, as well as a small number of border police, 2,500 ordinary MUP for public security purposes (although these were expected to draw down and to be transformed), and 3,000 local police.<ref>{{cite book|last=Charles|first=Ingrao|title=Confronting the Yugoslav Controversies: A Scholars' Initiative|year=2012|publisher=Purdue University Press|location=Indiana|isbn=978-1-61249-228-5|page=330|url=https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?filename=10&article=1027&context=purduepress_ebooks&type=additional|edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the Yugoslav Government cited military provisions of Appendix B of the Rambouillet provisions as the reason for its objections, claiming that it was an unacceptable violation of Yugoslavia's sovereignty, these provisions were essentially the same as had been applied to Bosnia for the [[SFOR]] (Stabilisation Force) mission there after the Dayton Agreement in 1995.

For the [[German Air Force]] (''Luftwaffe''), it was the second time it had participated in a conflict since World War II, after the [[Bosnian War]].\n\nThe proclaimed goal of the NATO operation was summed up by its spokesman as \"[[Serbs]] out, peacekeepers in, refugees back\". That is, Yugoslav troops would have to leave Kosovo and be replaced by international peacekeepers to ensure that the Albanian refugees could return to their homes. The campaign was initially designed to destroy Yugoslav air defences and high-value military targets. It did not go very well at first, with bad weather hindering many sorties early on. NATO had seriously underestimated Milo\u0161evi\u0107's will to resist: few in Brussels thought that the campaign would last more than a few days, and although the initial bombardment was not insignificant, it did not match the intensity of the bombing of Baghdad in 1991.\n\nNATO military operations switched increasingly to attacking Yugoslav units on the ground, hitting targets as small as individual tanks and artillery pieces, as well as continuing with the strategic bombardment. This activity was heavily constrained by politics, as each target needed to be approved by all nineteen member states. [[Montenegro]] was bombed on several occasions, but NATO eventually desisted to prop up the precarious position of its anti-Milo\u0161evi\u0107 leader, [[Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107]].\n\n[[File:Sremska mitrovica all force.jpg|thumb|Post-strike damage assessment of the [[Sremska Mitrovica]] ordnance storage depot, Serbia]]\n\nAt the start of May, a NATO aircraft attacked an Albanian refugee [[convoy]], believing it was a Yugoslav military convoy, killing around fifty people.

Blunt shared a part in the difficult task of addressing the potentially violent international incident. According to Blunt's account there was a stand-off with the Russians, and NATO Supreme Commander Clark gave provisional orders to over-power them.

Sejdiiu, a member of the LPK since 1985, said that this decision had been made because of the LPK's frustration with the ineffectiveness of the passive civil disobedience line of the dominant Kosovar party, Ibrahim Rugova's Democratic League of Kosova, the LDK. Sejdiiu said: With the creation of the KLA, the LDK, especially Rugova, started accusing the KLA of being a bunch of people linked to the Serbian state security. Roguva was saying that Serbia had an interest in destabilising us all. That was pure demagoguery because Serbia had it in hand, they didn't need any destabilisation and they controlled everything. So we have actually to fight on two fronts. As well as the military campaign we had to fight politically against the LDK as the main force who has been opposed to any other methods than peaceful means, while all the time only sitting in their offices, having meetings and press conferences. They have even been against the student organisation having mass demonstrations.

The status of Kosovo remains unresolved; international negotiations began in 2006 to determine Kosovo's level of autonomy as envisaged under [[UN Security Council Resolution 1244]], but efforts failed. The province is administered by the United Nations despite its [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|unilateral declaration of independence]] on February 17, 2008.\n\n[[File:Seized uniform.JPG|thumb|Seized uniform and equipment of US soldiers 1999 in Kosovo War]]\n\nThe UN-backed talks, led by UN Special Envoy [[Martti Ahtisaari]], had begun in February 2006.

By July 2007, the draft resolution, which was backed by the United States, United Kingdom, and other European members of the [[Security Council]], had been rewritten four times to try to accommodate Russian concerns that such a resolution would undermine the principle of state sovereignty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2007/06/29/nb-07|title=Russia reportedly rejects fourth draft resolution on Kosovo status|date=2007-06-29|work=[[Southeast European Times]]}}</ref> Russia, which holds a veto in the Security Council as one of [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|five permanent members]], stated that it would not support any resolution which is not acceptable to both Belgrade and Pri\u0161tina.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2007/07/10/nb-02|title=UN Security Council remains divided on Kosovo|date=2007-10-07|work=[[Southeast European Times]]}}</ref>\n\nThe campaign exposed significant weaknesses in the US arsenal, which were later addressed for the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]] and [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq]] campaigns. [[AH-64 Apache|Apache attack helicopters]] and [[AC-130 Spectre]] gunships were brought up to the front lines but were never used after two Apaches crashed during training in the Albanian mountains. Stocks of many precision missiles were reduced to critically low levels. For combat aircraft, continuous operations resulted in skipped maintenance schedules, and many aircraft were withdrawn from service awaiting spare parts and service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aeronautics.ru/nws002/theobserver04.htm |title=Hundreds of crippled jets put RAF in crisis |author=Antony Barnett |date=2000-01-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020105123907/http://www.aeronautics.ru/nws002/theobserver04.htm |archivedate=2002-01-05 |df= }}</ref> Also, many of the precision-guided weapons proved unable to cope with Balkan weather, as the clouds blocked the laser guidance beams. This was resolved by retrofitting bombs with [[Global Positioning System]] satellite guidance devices that are immune to bad weather. Although [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|pilotless surveillance aircraft]] were extensively used, often attack aircraft could not be brought to the scene quickly enough to hit targets of opportunity. This led missiles being fitted to Predator drones in Afghanistan, reducing the \"sensor to shooter\" time to virtually zero.\n\nKosovo also showed that some low-tech tactics could reduce the impact of a high-tech force such as NATO; the Milo\u0161evi\u0107 government cooperated with Saddam Hussein's Ba'athist regime in [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]], passing on many of the lessons learned.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/front/RTGAM/20021120/wless1120/Front/homeBN/breakingnews |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021122163917/http://www.globeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/front/RTGAM/20021120/wless1120/Front/homeBN/breakingnews |url-status=dead |archive-date=2002-11-22 |title=NATO attack on Yugoslavia gave Iraq good lessons |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |df= }}</ref> The Yugoslav army had long expected to need to resist a much stronger enemy, either [[Red Army|Soviet]] or NATO, during the [[Cold War]] and had developed effective tactics of deception and concealment in response. These would have been unlikely to have resisted a full-scale invasion for long, but were probably used to mislead overflying aircraft and satellites. Among the tactics used were:\n* US stealth aeroplanes were tracked with radars operating on long wavelengths. If stealth jets got wet or opened their bomb bay doors, they would become visible on the radar screens.

After 1945 the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|socialist]] government under [[Josip Broz Tito]] systematically repressed all manifestations of [[nationalism]] throughout Yugoslavia, seeking to ensure that no republic or nationality gained dominance over the others. In particular, Tito diluted the power of [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|Serbia]]\u2014the largest and most populous republic\u2014by establishing autonomous governments in the Serbian province of [[Vojvodina]] in the north and [[Autonomous Region of Kosovo and Metohija (1945-1963)|Kosovo and Metohija]] in the south. Kosovo's borders did not precisely match the areas of ethnic Albanian settlement in Yugoslavia (significant numbers of Albanians remained in the [[Albanians in the Republic of Macedonia|Socialist Republic of Macedonia]], [[Albanians in Montenegro|Montenegro]] and [[Albanians in Serbia|Serbia]]). Kosovo's formal autonomy, established under the 1945 Yugoslav constitution, initially meant relatively little in practice. The [[UDBA|secret police]] (the UDBA) cracked down hard on nationalists. In 1956 a number of [[Albanians]] went on trial in Kosovo on charges of espionage and subversion. The threat of separatism was in fact minimal, as the few underground groups aiming for union with [[Albania]] had little political significance. Their long-term impact became substantial, though, as some\u2014particularly the Revolutionary Movement for Albanian Unity, founded{{when|date=October 2014}} by [[Adem Dema\u00e7i]]\u2014would eventually form the political core of the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] (founded in 1990). Demaci himself was imprisoned in 1964 along with many of his followers. Yugoslavia underwent a period of economic and political crisis in 1969, as a massive government program of economic reform widened the gap between the rich north and poor south of the country.\n\nStudent demonstrations and riots in [[Belgrade]] in June 1968 spread to Kosovo in November, but Yugoslav security forces quelled them. Tito conceded some of the students' demands\u2014in particular, representative powers for Albanians in both the Serbian and Yugoslav state bodies and better recognition of the [[Albanian language]]. The [[University of Pristina (1969\u201399)|University of Pristina]] was established as an independent institution in 1970, ending a long period when the institution had been run as an outpost of [[Belgrade University]]. The lack of Albanian-language educational materials in Yugoslavia hampered Albanian education in Kosovo, so an agreement was struck with [[Socialist People's Republic of Albania|Albania]] itself to supply textbooks.\n\nIn 1969 the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] ordered its clergy to compile data on the ongoing problems of [[Serbs of Kosovo|Serbs in Kosovo]], seeking to pressure the government in Belgrade to do more to protect the interests of Serbs there.<ref>https://www.britannica.com/event/Kosovo-conflict</ref>\n\nIn 1974 Kosovo's political status improved further when a new Yugoslav constitution granted an expanded set of political rights. Along with [[Socialist Province of Vojvodina|Vojvodina]], Kosovo was [[Socialist Province of Kosovo|declared a province]] and gained many of the powers of a fully-fledged republic: a seat on the [[Presidency of Yugoslavia|federal presidency]] and its own assembly, police force and national bank.<ref>{{cite book|last=Judah|first=Tim|authorlink=Tim Judah|title=Kosovo: War and Revenge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sVf1na3FN_UC |accessdate=26 Nov 2012|year=2000|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven and London|isbn=978-0-300-08313-2|page=38}}</ref>\n\n===After the death of Tito (1980\u201386)===\nProvincial power was still exercised by the Communist Party, but now devolved mainly to ethnic Albanian communists. Tito's death on 4 May 1980 ushered in a long period of political instability, worsened by growing economic crisis and nationalist unrest. The first major outbreak occurred in Kosovo's main city, [[Pristina]], when a protest of University of Pristina students over long queues in their university canteen rapidly escalated and in late March and early April 1981 spread throughout Kosovo, causing [[1981 protests in Kosovo|mass demonstrations]] in several towns. The disturbances were quelled by the Presidency of Yugoslavia proclaiming a state of emergency, sending in riot police and the army, which resulted in numerous casualties.\n\nCommunist hard-liners instituted a fierce crackdown on nationalism of all kinds. Kosovo endured a heavy secret-police presence throughout most of the 1980s that ruthlessly suppressed any unauthorised nationalist manifestations, both Albanian and Serbian. According to a report quoted by [[Mark Thompson (reporter)|Mark Thompson]], as many as 580,000 inhabitants of Kosovo were arrested, interrogated, interned or reprimanded. Thousands of these lost their jobs or were expelled from their educational establishments. During this time tension between the Albanian and Serbian communities continued to escalate.\n\nIn February 1982 a group of priests from Serbia proper petitioned their bishops to ask \"why the Serbian Church is silent\" and why it did not campaign against \"the destruction, arson and sacrilege of the holy shrines of Kosovo\". Such concerns did attract interest in Belgrade. Stories appeared from time to time in the Belgrade media claiming that Serbs and Montenegrins were being persecuted. There was a perception among Serbian nationalists that Serbs were being driven out of Kosovo.\n\nIn addition to all this, the worsening state of Kosovo's economy made the province a poor choice for Serbs seeking work. Albanians, as well as Serbs, tended to favor their compatriots when hiring new employees, but the number of jobs was too few for the population. Kosovo was the poorest entity of Yugoslavia: the average per capita income was $795, compared with the national average of $2,635.\n\nIn 1981 it was reported that some 4,000 Serbs moved from Kosovo to central Serbia after the Kosovo Albanian riots in March that resulted in several Serb deaths and the desecration of Serbian Orthodox architecture and graveyards.<ref>The Associated Press-October 17, 1981 \"Minorities Leaving Yugoslav Province Dominated by Albanians\"</ref> Serbia reacted with a plan to reduce the power of Albanians in the province and a propaganda campaign that claimed Serbs were being pushed out of the province primarily by the growing Albanian population, rather than the bad state of the economy.<ref name=\"Ramet2010\">{{cite book|last=Ramet|first=Sabrina P.|title=Central and Southeast European Politics Since 1989|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oFXdiS25N78C&pg=PA361|accessdate=9 March 2012|date=18 February 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-71616-1|page=361}}</ref> 33 nationalist formations were dismantled by Yugoslav police, who sentenced some 280 people (800 fined, 100 under investigation) and seized arms caches and propaganda material.<ref>''Financial Times'' (London) February 5, 1982\u2013\"Police fail to crush resistance in Kosovo\"</ref>\n\n===Kosovo and the rise of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 (1986\u201390)===\n{{Original research section|date=September 2009}}\nIn 1987 [[David Binder (journalist)|David Binder]] wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'' about the growing ethnic tension in Yugoslavia and rising nationalism among Albanians in Kosovo and referred to the [[Para\u0107in massacre]], where an ethnic Albanian soldier in the JNA killed four fellow soldiers.<ref name=NYDB>''[[The New York Times]]'', November 1, 1987, Late City Final Edition (p.14) -\"[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/01/world/in-yugoslavia-rising-ethnic-strife-brings-fears-of-worse-civil-conflict.html In Yugoslavia, Rising Ethnic Strife Brings Fears of Worse Civil Conflict] By David Binder</ref> Binder also\u2014writing of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107's deposing of [[Dragi\u0161a Pavlovi\u0107]] as head of Belgrade's party organisation shortly before\u2014wrote that \"Mr. Milosevic accused Mr. Pavlovic of being an appeaser who was soft on Albanian radicals\", and that \"Mr. Milosevic and his supporters appear to be staking their careers on a strategy of confrontation with the Kosovo ethnic Albanians\".<ref name=NYDB/> The article quotes the Federal Secretary for National Defence, Fleet Adm.

It was against this tense background that the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] (SANU) conducted a survey of Serbs who had left Kosovo in 1985 and 1986, which concluded that a considerable number had left under pressure from Albanians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snd-us.com/history/Petrovic-Blagojevic/index.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010523033457/http://www.snd-us.com/history/Petrovic-Blagojevic/index.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2001-05-23 |title=The Migration of Serbs and Montenegrins from Kosovo and Metohija |year=2000 |publisher=Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts |author=Ruza Petrovic, [[Marina Blagojevic]] |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe so-called [[SANU Memorandum]], leaked in September 1986, was a draft document that focused on the political difficulties facing Serbs in Yugoslavia, pointing to Tito's deliberate hobbling of Serbia's power and the difficulties faced by Serbs outside [[Serbia proper]]. It paid special attention to Kosovo, arguing that the Kosovo Serbs were being subjected to \"physical, political, legal and cultural genocide\" in an \"open and total war\" that had been ongoing since the spring of 1981. It claimed that Kosovo's status in 1986 was a worse historical defeat for the Serbs than any event since liberation from the Ottomans in 1804, thus ranking it above such catastrophes as the World war occupations. The Memorandum's authors claimed that 200,000 Serbs had moved out of the province over the previous 20 years and warned that there would soon be none left \"unless things change radically.\" The remedy, according to the Memorandum, was for \"genuine security and unambiguous equality for all peoples living in Kosovo and Metohija [to be] established\" and \"objective and permanent conditions for the return of the expelled [Serbian] nation [to be] created.\" It concluded that \"Serbia must not be passive and wait and see what the others will say, as it has done so often in the past.\" The SANU Memorandum provoked split reactions: Albanians saw it as a call for Serbian supremacy at the local level, claiming the Serb emigrants had left Kosovo for economic reasons, while the Slovenes and Croats saw a threat in the call for a more assertive Serbia. Serbs were divided: many welcomed it, while the Communist old guard strongly attacked its message. One of those who denounced it was Serbian Communist Party official [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]].\n\nIn November 1988 Kosovo's head of the provincial committee was arrested. In March 1989 Milo\u0161evi\u0107 announced an \"[[anti-bureaucratic revolution]]\" in Kosovo and Vojvodina, curtailing their autonomy as well as imposing a curfew and a state of emergency in Kosovo due to violent demonstrations, resulting in 24 deaths (including two policemen).

NATO's response to this offensive was mid-June's Operation Determined Falcon, a NATO show of force over the Yugoslav borders.<ref>{{cite web|author=John Pike|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/determined_falcon.htm|title=Operation Determined Falcon|publisher=Globalsecurity.org|accessdate=2012-05-06}}</ref>\n\nDuring this time, Yugoslav President Milo\u0161evi\u0107 reached an arrangement with Boris Yeltsin of Russia to stop offensive operations and prepare for talks with the Albanians, who refused to talk to the Serbian side throughout the crisis, but would talk with the Yugoslav government. In fact, the only meeting between Milo\u0161evi\u0107 and Ibrahim Rugova happened on 15 May in Belgrade, two days after [[Richard Holbrooke]] announced that it would take place. Holbrooke threatened Milo\u0161evi\u0107 that if he did not obey, \"what's left of your country will implode\". A month later, Holbrooke visited the border areas affected by the fighting in early June, where he was famously photographed with the KLA. The publication of these images sent a signal to the KLA, its supporters and sympathisers, and to observers in general, that the US was decisively backing the KLA and the Albanian population in Kosovo.{{fact?|date=February 2017}}\n\nThe Yeltsin agreement required Milo\u0161evi\u0107 to allow international representatives to set up a mission in Kosovo to monitor the situation there. The [[Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission]] (KDOM) began operations in early July 1998. The US government welcomed this part of the agreement, but denounced the initiative's call for a mutual cease fire. Rather, the US demanded that the Serbian-Yugoslavian side should cease fire \"without linkage&nbsp;... to a cessation in terrorist activities\".\n\nAll through June and into mid-July, the KLA maintained its advance. The KLA surrounded [[Pe\u0107]] and [[Gjakova|\u0110akovica]], and set up an interim capital in the town of [[Mali\u0161evo]] (north of [[Orahovac]]). KLA troops infiltrated [[Suva Reka]] and the northwest of Pristina. They moved on to capture the Belacevec coal pits in late June, threatening energy supplies in the region. Their tactics as usual focused mainly on [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] and [[mountain warfare]], and harassing and ambushing Yugoslav forces and Serb police patrols.{{fact?|date=February 2017}}\n\nThe tide turned in mid-July when the KLA captured Orahovac. On 17 July 1998, two nearby villages, Retimlije and Opteru\u0161a, were also captured, while less systematic events took place in the larger Serb-populated village of Velika Ho\u010da. The Orthodox monastery of Zociste {{convert|3|mi|km|spell=in}} from Orehovac\u2014famous for the relics of the Saints Kosmas and Damianos and revered also by local Albanians\u2014was robbed, its monks deported to a KLA prison camp, and, while empty, the monastery church and all its buildings were levelled to the ground by mining. This led to a series of Serb and Yugoslav offensives which would continue into the beginning of August.{{fact?|date=February 2017}}\n\nA new set of KLA attacks in mid-August triggered Yugoslavian operations in south-central Kosovo, south of the Pristina-Pe\u0107 road. This wound down with the capture of [[Kle\u010dka]] on August 23 and the discovery of a KLA-run crematorium in which some of their victims were found. The KLA began an offensive on September 1 around [[Prizren]], causing Yugoslavian military activity there. In western Kosovo, around Pe\u0107, another offensive caused condemnation as international officials expressed fear that a large column of displaced people would be attacked.{{fact?|date=February 2017}}\n\nIn early mid-September, for the first time, KLA activity was reported in northern Kosovo around [[Podujevo]]. Finally, in late September, a determined effort was made to clear the KLA out of the northern and central parts of Kosovo and out of the Drenica valley itself. During this time many threats were made from Western capitals but these were tempered somewhat by the elections in Bosnia, as they did not want Serbian Democrats and Radicals to win. Following the elections, the threats intensified once again, but a galvanising event was needed. They got it on September 28, when [[Gornje Obrinje massacre|the mutilated corpses of a family]] were discovered by KDOM outside the village of Gornje Obrinje. The bloody image of a child's doll and streams of displaced persons rallied the international community to action.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5EFihegRpmkC&pg=PA356|page=356|title=Handbook of Ethnic Conflict: International Perspectives|editor=Dan Landis, Rosita D.

Hill|Christopher Hill]], was leading [[shuttle diplomacy]] between an Albanian delegation, led by Rugova, and the Yugoslav and Serbian authorities. These meetings were shaping the peace plan to be discussed during a period of planned NATO occupation of Kosovo. During a period of two weeks, threats intensified, culminating in NATO's Activation Order being given. NATO was ready to begin airstrikes, and Richard Holbrooke went to Belgrade in the hope of reaching an agreement with Milo\u0161evi\u0107. Officially, the international community demanded an end to fighting. It specifically demanded that Yugoslavia end its offensives against the KLA whilst attempting to convince the KLA to drop its bid for independence. Attempts were made to persuade Milo\u0161evi\u0107 to permit NATO peacekeeping troops to enter Kosovo. This, they argued, would allow for the Christopher Hill peace process to proceed and yield a peace agreement.\n\nOn 13 October 1998, the [[North Atlantic Council]] issued activation orders for the execution of both limited [[air strike]]s and a phased [[aerial warfare|air campaign]] in Yugoslavia which would begin in approximately 96 hours.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Statement to the Press by the Secretary General Following Decision on the ACTORD|date=13 October 1998|publisher=NATO|url=http://www.nato.int/docu/speech/1998/s981013a.htm}}</ref> On 15 October the NATO [[Kosovo Verification Mission]] (KVM) Agreement for a ceasefire was signed, and the deadline for withdrawal was extended to 27 October.<ref name=\"gs_oee\">{{cite web|title=Operation Eagle Eye|publisher=GlobalSecurity.org|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/eagle_eye.htm}}</ref><ref name=\"nato_oaf\">{{cite web|title=Operation Allied Force|publisher=NATO|url=http://www.afsouth.nato.int/archives/operations/detforce/force.htm|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927191114/http://www.afsouth.nato.int/archives/operations/detforce/force.htm|archivedate=2011-09-27|df=}}</ref> Difficulties implementing the agreement were reported, as clashes continued between government troops and the guerrillas.<ref>{{cite web|author=Paul Watson|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1998-10-20/news/9810190342_1_kosovo-liberation-army-serbian-forces-serbian-officials|title=Serb Troops Digging In To Battle Kosovo Rebels|work=Sun Sentinel|date=1998-10-20|accessdate=2012-11-08}}</ref> The Serbian withdrawal commenced on or around 25 October 1998, and [[Operation Eagle Eye (Kosovo)|Operation Eagle Eye]] commenced on 30 October.<ref name=\"gs_oee\" /><ref name=\"nato_oaf\" />\n\nThe KVM was a large contingent of unarmed [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE) peace monitors (officially known as verifiers) that moved into Kosovo.

This massacre was the turning point of the war. [[NATO]] decided that the conflict could only be settled by introducing a military peacekeeping force under the auspices of NATO, to forcibly restrain the two sides.

It also called for a peace conference to be held in February 1999 at the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Rambouillet]], outside Paris.\n\nThe [[Rambouillet Agreement|Rambouillet talks]] began on 6 February 1999, with [[Secretary General of NATO|NATO Secretary General]] [[Javier Solana]] negotiating with both sides. They were intended to conclude by 19 February. The FR Yugoslavian delegation was led by then president of Serbia [[Milan Milutinovi\u0107]], while Milo\u0161evi\u0107 himself remained in Belgrade. This was in contrast to the 1995 [[Dayton Agreement|Dayton conference]] that ended the war in Bosnia, where Milo\u0161evi\u0107 negotiated in person. The absence of Milo\u0161evi\u0107 was interpreted as a sign that the real decisions were being made back in Belgrade, a move that aroused criticism in Yugoslavia as well as abroad; Kosovo's Serbian Orthodox bishop [[Artemije]] traveled all the way to Rambouillet to protest that the delegation was wholly unrepresentative. At this time speculation about an indictment of Milo\u0161evi\u0107 for war crimes was rife, so his absence may have been motivated by fear of arrest.\n\n[[File:72nd Special Brigade equipment 1999, Belgrade Military Museum .jpg|thumb|upright|Equipment of 72nd Special Brigade [[Yugoslav Army (FRY)|Yugoslav Army]] in the 1999 Kosovo War]]\n\nThe first phase of negotiations was successful. In particular, a statement was issued by the Contact Group co-chairmen on 23 February 1999 that the negotiations \"have led to a ''consensus'' on substantial autonomy for Kosovo, including on mechanisms for free and fair elections to democratic institutions, for the governance of Kosovo, for the protection of human rights and the rights of members of national communities; and for the establishment of a fair judicial system\". They went on to say that \"a political framework is now in place\", leaving the further work of finalising \"the implementation Chapters of the Agreement, including the modalities of the ''invited international'' civilian and military presence in Kosovo\".\n\nWhile the accords did not fully satisfy the Albanians, they were much too radical for the Yugoslavs, who responded by substituting a drastically revised text that even Russia (ally of FR Yugoslavia) found unacceptable. It sought to reopen the painstakingly negotiated political status of Kosovo and deleted all of the proposed implementation measures. Among many other changes in the proposed new version, it eliminated the entire chapter on humanitarian assistance and reconstruction, removed virtually all international oversight and dropped any mention of invoking \"the will of the people [of Kosovo]\" in determining the final status of the province.\n\nOn 18 March 1999, the Albanian, US, and British delegations signed what became known as the [[Rambouillet Agreement|Rambouillet Accords]], while the Yugoslav and Russian delegations refused. The accords called for NATO administration of Kosovo as an autonomous province within Yugoslavia, a force of 30,000 NATO troops to maintain order in Kosovo; an unhindered right of passage for NATO troops on Yugoslav territory, including Kosovo; and immunity for NATO and its agents to Yugoslav law. They would have also permitted a continuing Yugoslav army presence of 1,500 troops for border monitoring, backed by up to 1,000 troops to perform command and support functions, as well as a small number of border police, 2,500 ordinary MUP for public security purposes (although these were expected to draw down and to be transformed), and 3,000 local police.<ref>{{cite book|last=Charles|first=Ingrao|title=Confronting the Yugoslav Controversies: A Scholars' Initiative|year=2012|publisher=Purdue University Press|location=Indiana|isbn=978-1-61249-228-5|page=330|url=https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?filename=10&article=1027&context=purduepress_ebooks&type=additional|edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the Yugoslav Government cited military provisions of Appendix B of the Rambouillet provisions as the reason for its objections, claiming that it was an unacceptable violation of Yugoslavia's sovereignty, these provisions were essentially the same as had been applied to Bosnia for the [[SFOR]] (Stabilisation Force) mission there after the Dayton Agreement in 1995.

[[BGM-109 Tomahawk|Tomahawk]] [[cruise missile]]s were also extensively used, fired from aircraft, ships, and submarines. With the exception of Greece, all NATO members were involved to some degree. Over the ten weeks of the conflict, NATO aircraft flew over 38,000 combat missions. For the [[German Air Force]] (''Luftwaffe''), it was the second time it had participated in a conflict since World War II, after the [[Bosnian War]].\n\nThe proclaimed goal of the NATO operation was summed up by its spokesman as \"[[Serbs]] out, peacekeepers in, refugees back\". That is, Yugoslav troops would have to leave Kosovo and be replaced by international peacekeepers to ensure that the Albanian refugees could return to their homes. The campaign was initially designed to destroy Yugoslav air defences and high-value military targets. It did not go very well at first, with bad weather hindering many sorties early on. NATO had seriously underestimated Milo\u0161evi\u0107's will to resist: few in Brussels thought that the campaign would last more than a few days, and although the initial bombardment was not insignificant, it did not match the intensity of the bombing of Baghdad in 1991.\n\nNATO military operations switched increasingly to attacking Yugoslav units on the ground, hitting targets as small as individual tanks and artillery pieces, as well as continuing with the strategic bombardment. This activity was heavily constrained by politics, as each target needed to be approved by all nineteen member states. [[Montenegro]] was bombed on several occasions, but NATO eventually desisted to prop up the precarious position of its anti-Milo\u0161evi\u0107 leader, [[Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107]].\n\n[[File:Sremska mitrovica all force.jpg|thumb|Post-strike damage assessment of the [[Sremska Mitrovica]] ordnance storage depot, Serbia]]\n\nAt the start of May, a NATO aircraft attacked an Albanian refugee [[convoy]], believing it was a Yugoslav military convoy, killing around fifty people.

Blunt shared a part in the difficult task of addressing the potentially violent international incident. According to Blunt's account there was a stand-off with the Russians, and NATO Supreme Commander Clark gave provisional orders to over-power them.

Sejdiiu, a member of the LPK since 1985, said that this decision had been made because of the LPK's frustration with the ineffectiveness of the passive civil disobedience line of the dominant Kosovar party, Ibrahim Rugova's Democratic League of Kosova, the LDK. Sejdiiu said: With the creation of the KLA, the LDK, especially Rugova, started accusing the KLA of being a bunch of people linked to the Serbian state security. Roguva was saying that Serbia had an interest in destabilising us all. That was pure demagoguery because Serbia had it in hand, they didn't need any destabilisation and they controlled everything. So we have actually to fight on two fronts. As well as the military campaign we had to fight politically against the LDK as the main force who has been opposed to any other methods than peaceful means, while all the time only sitting in their offices, having meetings and press conferences. They have even been against the student organisation having mass demonstrations.

The status of Kosovo remains unresolved; international negotiations began in 2006 to determine Kosovo's level of autonomy as envisaged under [[UN Security Council Resolution 1244]], but efforts failed. The province is administered by the United Nations despite its [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|unilateral declaration of independence]] on February 17, 2008.\n\n[[File:Seized uniform.JPG|thumb|Seized uniform and equipment of US soldiers 1999 in Kosovo War]]\n\nThe UN-backed talks, led by UN Special Envoy [[Martti Ahtisaari]], had begun in February 2006.

By July 2007, the draft resolution, which was backed by the United States, United Kingdom, and other European members of the [[Security Council]], had been rewritten four times to try to accommodate Russian concerns that such a resolution would undermine the principle of state sovereignty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2007/06/29/nb-07|title=Russia reportedly rejects fourth draft resolution on Kosovo status|date=2007-06-29|work=[[Southeast European Times]]}}</ref> Russia, which holds a veto in the Security Council as one of [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|five permanent members]], stated that it would not support any resolution which is not acceptable to both Belgrade and Pri\u0161tina.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2007/07/10/nb-02|title=UN Security Council remains divided on Kosovo|date=2007-10-07|work=[[Southeast European Times]]}}</ref>\n\nThe campaign exposed significant weaknesses in the US arsenal, which were later addressed for the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]] and [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq]] campaigns. [[AH-64 Apache|Apache attack helicopters]] and [[AC-130 Spectre]] gunships were brought up to the front lines but were never used after two Apaches crashed during training in the Albanian mountains. Stocks of many precision missiles were reduced to critically low levels. For combat aircraft, continuous operations resulted in skipped maintenance schedules, and many aircraft were withdrawn from service awaiting spare parts and service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aeronautics.ru/nws002/theobserver04.htm |title=Hundreds of crippled jets put RAF in crisis |author=Antony Barnett |date=2000-01-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020105123907/http://www.aeronautics.ru/nws002/theobserver04.htm |archivedate=2002-01-05 |df= }}</ref> Also, many of the precision-guided weapons proved unable to cope with Balkan weather, as the clouds blocked the laser guidance beams. This was resolved by retrofitting bombs with [[Global Positioning System]] satellite guidance devices that are immune to bad weather. Although [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|pilotless surveillance aircraft]] were extensively used, often attack aircraft could not be brought to the scene quickly enough to hit targets of opportunity. This led missiles being fitted to Predator drones in Afghanistan, reducing the \"sensor to shooter\" time to virtually zero.\n\nKosovo also showed that some low-tech tactics could reduce the impact of a high-tech force such as NATO; the Milo\u0161evi\u0107 government cooperated with Saddam Hussein's Ba'athist regime in [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]], passing on many of the lessons learned.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/front/RTGAM/20021120/wless1120/Front/homeBN/breakingnews |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021122163917/http://www.globeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/front/RTGAM/20021120/wless1120/Front/homeBN/breakingnews |url-status=dead |archive-date=2002-11-22 |title=NATO attack on Yugoslavia gave Iraq good lessons |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |df= }}</ref> The Yugoslav army had long expected to need to resist a much stronger enemy, either [[Red Army|Soviet]] or NATO, during the [[Cold War]] and had developed effective tactics of deception and concealment in response. These would have been unlikely to have resisted a full-scale invasion for long, but were probably used to mislead overflying aircraft and satellites. Among the tactics used were:\n* US stealth aeroplanes were tracked with radars operating on long wavelengths. If stealth jets got wet or opened their bomb bay doors, they would become visible on the radar screens.
