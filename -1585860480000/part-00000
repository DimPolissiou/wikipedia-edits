The foundation of French cuisine, the ''[[Fran\u00e7ois Pierre La Varenne|Cuisinier Fran\u00e7ois]]'' ran through some thirty editions in seventy-five years.\n\nThe sauce originally was a [[Velout\u00e9 sauce|veal velout\u00e9]], with a large amount of cream added.<ref>''Larousse Gastronomique''.</ref>\n\nA recipe published in 1749 gave a modern and a traditional version of b\u00e9chamel.  The traditional one was made by melting butter in a pan, and then frying the peels of onions and root vegetables, green onions, and parsley in it; after cooking, cream was added, along with salt, coarse ground black pepper, and nutmeg.  This was boiled, strained, and served with extra butter.  The more modern recipe was to fry minced shallot, parsley, and green onion in butter, adding cream, salt, coarse ground black pepper, and nutmeg, as before, but then to add additional parsley and serve without straining.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k54549881|title=La science du ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel cuisinier , avec des observations sur la connaissance & propri\u00e9t\u00e9s des alimens|last=Menon (17-17 ; \u00e9crivain culinaire)|first=|date=1749|publisher=Paulus-Du-Mesnil (Paris)|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=535|language=FR}}</ref>  A 1750 recipe for [[turbot]] involved cooking the fish in broth, cooling it, and then reheating it in b\u00e9chamel immediately before serving.<ref name=\":0\" /> A vegan version can be made by replacing butter with oil and the milk with a plant based alternative.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Food}}\n* [[List of sauces]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/SauceHistory.htm History and legends of B\u00e9chamel sauce]\n* [http://stellaculinary.com/podcasts/video/culinary-school-bechamel-sauce-how-to-video/ Free Culinary School Video Episode 11]\u2014An educational podcast episode that talks about the classical French technique used for making Sauce B\u00e9chamel and a few secondary sauces including Mornay, Basic Cream, Cheddar Cheese and Mustard Sauce.\n* {{Cite NIE|wstitle=Bechamel|year=1905 |short=x}}\n\n{{White sauces}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bechamel Sauce}}\n[[Category:French sauces]]\n[[Category:Mother sauces]]\n[[Category:White sauces]]\n", "name_user": "Mezze stagioni", "label": "safe", "comment": "wikilinks, newlines", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9chamel_sauce"}

It is located east of the [[Indus River]] and comprises seven districts: [[Abbottabad District|Abbottabad]], [[Battagram District|Battagram]], [[Haripur District|Haripur]], [[Mansehra District|Mansehra]], [[Upper Kohistan District|Upper Kohistan]], [[Lower Kohistan District|Lower Kohistan]], and [[Torghar District|Torghar]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Name===\n[[Babur]], founder of the [[Mughal Empire]] in the early 16th century, records the name ''Hazara'' in [[Baburnama|his autobiography]]. He referred to the populace of a region called ''[[Hazarajat|Hazaristan]]'', located west of the [[Kabulistan]] region, east of [[Ghor Province|Ghor]], and north of [[Ghazni Province|Ghazni]].\n\nThe conventional theory is that the name ''Hazara'' derives from the [[Persian language|Persian]] word for \"thousand\" (''hez\u0101r'' \u0647\u0632\u0627\u0631).

In 327 B.C., Alexander handed the area over to [[Abisares|Abisaras]] (\u0391\u03b2\u03b9\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b7\u03c2), the raja of Poonch state.\n\nHazara remained a part of the [[Taxila (modern)|Taxila]] administration during the rule of the [[Maurya dynasty]]. [[Ashoka the Great]] was the governor of the area when he was a prince. After the death of his father [[Bindusara]] around 272 B.C., Ashoka inherited the throne and ruled this area as well as [[Gandhara]]. Today, the Edicts of Ashoka [http://thehazarapoint.com/ inscribed]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thehazarapoint.com/|title=The Hazara Point \u2013 History of Hazara|website=thehazarapoint.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-29}}</ref> on three large boulders near Bareri Hill serve as evidence of his rule there. The Mansehra rocks record fourteen of Ashoka's edicts, presenting aspects of the emperor's ''dharma'' or righteous law, and represent the earliest irrefutable evidence of writing in South Asia. Dating to middle of the third century BC, they are written from right to left in the [[Kharosthi]] script.<ref>[https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1881/ UNESCO World Heritage Centre - Mansehra Rock Edicts]</ref>\n\nHazara has several places of significance for the [[Hindu]]s related to the Pandavas.\n{{cquote|'There are the five Pandavas, the heroes of the [[Mahabharat]] favourite objects of worship in the east and sometimes addressed as the Panj Pir. Many are the legends current about these heroes and they are localised at quite a number of places. The Hill of [[Mukeshpuri|Mokshpuri]], just above [[Dunga Gali]] has an elevation of 9232 feet. Its name means 'the hill of salvation' and on its summit is a ''Panduan da Sthan'', or place of the [[Pandavas]], where it is said they were visited and tempted by [[Apsara]]s who still frequent the place .<ref>A glossary of the tribes and castes of the Punjab and North-West provinces, compiled by H A Rose, v. I p. 120</ref>}}\nIn the 2nd century CE, a mythical king Raja Risalu, son of Raja [[Salbahan]] of [[Sialkot]], supposedly brought the area under his control. The local people consider him as a popular folk hero. When a Chinese pilgrim, [[Xuanzang|Hiun-Tsang]], visited this area, it was under the control of Raja Durlabhavardhana, the ruler of [[Kashmir]].\n\nThe [[Shahi]] dynasties ruled Hazara one after another. Among the Hindu Shahi dynasty rulers, Raja [[Jayapala]] is the best known. [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Mehmood of Ghazni]] defeated Raja Jayapala during his first campaign. However, there is no historical evidence that Mehmood of Ghazni ever visited or passed through Mansehra. After the fall of the Shahi dynasty, in the 11th century, the Kashmiris took control of the area under the leadership of Kalashan (1063 to 1089). From 1112 to 1120, King Susala ruled the area. In the 12th century, Asalat Khan captured this area but soon after [[Mohammad of Ghor]]'s death the Kashmiris once again regained control of Hazara.\n\n[[Amb (princely state)|Amb]] and its surrounding areas of Hazara have a long history which can be traced to Alexander the Great's invasion of India. [[Arrian]], Alexander's historian, did not indicate the exact location of [[Embolina]], but since it is known that Aoronos was on the right bank of the River Indus, the town chosen to serve as Alexander's base of supplies may with good reason be also looked for there. The mention in [[Ptolemy's Geography]] of Embolima as a town of Indo-Scythia situated on the Indus supports this theory.\n\n===Turk rule===\n[[File:Akbar.jpg|thumb|right|Akbar as a boy around 1557]]\nIn 1399, the Muslim warrior [[Timur]], on his return to [[Kabul]], stationed his Turk soldiers (who belonged to a sub-tribe of Turks, called [[Karlugh Turks]]) in Hazara to protect the important route between Kabul and Kashmir. By 1472, Prince Shahab-ud-Din came from Kabul and established his rule over the region.\n\nAt the beginning of the 18th century, Turkish rule came to an end due to the increased aggression of the [[Swati (Pashtun tribe)|Swati]]s and their allied forces. The most crucial attack was that of the [[Swati (Pashtun tribe)|Swati]]s in collusion with Syed Jalal Baba in 1703. Syed Jalal Shah was the son in law of the last ruler of Turkic dynasty, Thus [[Swati (Pashtun tribe)|Swati]]s ousted the Turks and captured this area. <ref>Hazara Gazetteer 1883-84</ref>\n<ref>Tareekh e Hazara</ref>\n\nDuring the period of Mughal rule, local Turkish chiefs acknowledged [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] authority. In fact, Mansehra provided the main route to [[Kashmir]] and was the most commonly used route for [[Emperor Akbar]] to travel to Kashmir.\n\n===Durrani Pashtun rule===\nHazara remained part of the Afghan [[Durrani Empire]] from the mid-18th to the early 19th centuries. Durranis considered it wise to rule the region through the local tribal chiefs. The lower Hazara plain was a separate administrative region attached to the Chacch and Attock areas of Northern [[Punjab region|Punjab]] whereas most of upper Hazara was attached to the Durrani 'Subah' or governorship of [[Kashmir]], with the exception of the Tanawal Ilaqa ([[Amb (princely state)]]) or area, which paid liege homage or tribute in exchange for comparative independence. This 'Subah' or governorship was ruled by Suba Khan Tanoli during Afghan [[Durrani Empire]]<ref>Hazara Gazetteer 1883-84</ref>\n\n===British rule===\nAfter the First Sikh War, under the terms of the Treaty of Lahore, the area was governed by [[James Abbott (Indian Army officer)|Major James Abbott]]. Abbott managed to secure and pacify the area within a year. During the [[Second Anglo-Sikh War|Second Sikh War]] Abbott and his men were cut off by the Sikh army from supplies and reinforcements from the rest of the British Army, but were able to maintain their position.<ref>[[Charles Allen (writer)|Charles Allen]], ''Soldier-Sahibs: The Men who made the North-West Frontier'', London: Abacus, 2001. pp. 193-195. {{ISBN|0-349-11456-0}}</ref>\n\nBy 1849, the British had gained control of all of Hazara. However, the western [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] tribes were occasionally rebellious. These tribes included the [[Swati (Pashtun tribe)|Swati]] [[clans]] of [[Allai Tehsil|Allai]], [[Batagram]] in the Nandhiar valley, [[The Black Mountain (Tor Ghar) Tribes]]. The British sent many expeditions against these tribes to crush several uprisings between 1852 and the 1920s.\n\nThe British divided [[Hazara District]] into three [[Tehsils]] (administrative subdivisions) : Mansehra, [[Abbottabad District|Abbottabad]], and [[Haripur District|Haripur]] and annexed it to the [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]]. In 1901, when the North-West Frontier Province (now [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]]) was formed, Hazara was separated from Punjab and made a part of NWFP.\n\n===Hazara Muslim League===\nFrom the early 1930s onwards, the people of Hazara gradually became active in the freedom movement for an independent Pakistan under the active leadership of renowned All India Muslim League leaders such as Shanshah e Muazzam [[Abdul Majid Khan Tarin]] of Talokar (1877\u20131939), an early member of the (then) Frontier Legislative Assembly, and others. Even before the [[All-India Muslim League]] started its movement for Pakistan in 1937, after the historic Lucknow Session of October that year, the Hazara Muslim League was properly formed and convened at the residence of Noor-Ud-Din Qureshi in Abbottabad in 1936. In this meeting the leaders of the All-India Muslim League, Nawab [[Bahadur Yar Jang]], [[Maulana Shaukat Ali]], Hamid Badayuni and others, came from India. The local people joined the movement in large numbers. In Mansehra in the same year the Muslim League was organised by Ali Gohar Khan of Chitti Dheri and Hakim Abdul Karim, who were elected the first president and general secretary of the tehsil Mansehra Muslim League. During the final phase of the movement for the creation of Pakistan, Captain Sardar Zain Muhammad Khan, OBI, and [[Jalal-ud-din Jalal Baba]] defeated their Congress rivals in the elections of 1946 from their respective rural and urban Constituencies, and politically routed the All India Congress from the region. In the Delhi Convention of Muslim League parliamentarians chaired by [[Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], which finally voted for the division of India and the creation of Pakistan, Capt. Sardar Zain Muhammad Khan represented Hazara. These Muslim League Leaders were also able to mobilize the people of this area in favour of the referendum for the creation of Pakistan. Jalal Baba, who was the main force behind Referendum in Hazara, served as the President of District Muslim League for 22 years. \n[[File:Jalal Baba's portrait.jpg|thumb|Khan Jalaluddin Khan (Jalal Baba)]]\nSometime before the [[Partition of India|independence]] of [[Pakistan]] in 1947, [[Muhammad Farid Khan|Nawab Muhammad Farid Khan Tanoli]] (KBE) of [[Amb (princely state)|Amb]] State also developed good relations with Jinnah and Nawabzada [[Liaqat Ali Khan]]as a politic move.

The areas around [[Abbottabad]] and [[Mansehra]] became the [[Hazara District]] of [[Peshawar Division]], whilst areas to the north of this became the [[Hazara Tribal Agency]]. Sandwiched between Hazara Tribal Agency and Hazara District were the small [[princely state]]s of [[State of Amb|Amb]] and [[State of Phulra|Phulra]]. This system of administration continued until 1950, when these two small states were incorporated into the Hazara district.\n\n[[File:Darband 1948, Governer frontier and PM.jpg|thumb|right|400px|In this picture seated (left to right): [[Sahibzada Mohammad Khurshid]] (first Pakistani Governor of the NWFP), [[Nawabzada Liaquat Ali Khan]] (Li\u0101qat Al\u012b Kh\u0101n) (Urdu: \u0644\u06cc\u0627\u0642\u062a \u0639\u0644\u06cc \u062e\u0627\u0646) listen (help\u00b7info) (2 October 1896 \u2013 16 October 1951) the first [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]], Nawab Sir [[Muhammad Farid Khan|Muhammad Farid Khan Tanoli]] (Nawab of Amb) and [[Begum Ra'ana Liaquat Ali Khan]] (wife of Liaquat Ali Khan).

The division was initially composed of two districts (Abbottabad, and Mansehra) but within a few years, Haripur district was spun off from Abbottabad District and Batagram District was spun off from Mansehra District.\n\nHazara remained a district until its conversion into a division in 1976. In October 1976, Mansehra was given the status of a full-fledged district, which consisted of Mansehra and Batagram tehsils. Subsequently, in July 1991, Haripur Tehsil was separated from Abbottabad and made into a district. Thus only the old Tehsil of Abbottabad remained, which was declared as Abbottabad District.\n\nIn 2000, administrative divisions were abolished and the fourth-tier districts were raised to become the new third tier of government in Pakistan. At abolition it contained the following districts:<ref>[http://www.ecp.gov.pk/content/District.html Divisions/Districts of Pakistan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060930093025/http://www.ecp.gov.pk/content/District.html |date=2006-09-30 }}<br /> Note: Although divisions as an administrative structure has been abolished, the election commission of Pakistan still groups districts under the division names</ref>\n\n* [[Abbottabad District]]\n* [[Battagram District|Batagram District]]\n* [[Haripur District]]\n* [[Upper Kohistan District]] (part of [[Kohistan District, Pakistan|Kohistan District]] until 2014)\n* [[Lower Kohistan District]] (part of [[Kohistan District, Pakistan|Kohistan District]] until 2014)\n* [[Mansehra District]]\n* [[Torghar District]] (part of [[Mansehra District]] until 2011)\n\nEventually, with all the administrative divisions being restored back in 2008, Hazara Division has returned.\n\n==Geography and climate==\n[[File:Tilla Charouni.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Tilla Charouni, On the border between Hazara and Islamabad capital territory]]\nHazara is bounded on the north and east by the [[Northern Areas]] and [[Azad Kashmir]]. To the south are the [[Islamabad Capital Territory]] and the province of [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], whilst to the west lies the rest of [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]]. The river [[Indus River|Indus]] runs through the division in a north-south line, forming much of the western border of the division. The total area of Hazara is 18,013&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.\n\nBecause it lies immediately south of the main [[Himalaya]] Range, and is exposed to moist winds from the [[Arabian Sea]], Hazara is the wettest part of Pakistan. At Abbottabad, annual rainfall averages around {{convert|1,200|mm}} but has been as high as {{convert|1,800|mm}}, whilst in parts of Mansehra District such as [[Balakot]] the mean annual rainfall is as high as {{convert|1,750|mm}} . Due to its location on the boundary between the monsoonal summer rainfall regime of [[East Asia]] and the winter-dominant [[Mediterranean climate]] of [[West Asia]], Hazara has an unusual bimodal rainfall regime, with one peak in February or March associated with frontal southwest cloudbands and another monsoonal peak in July and August. The driest months are October to December, though in the wettest parts even these months average around {{convert|40|mm}} .\n\nDue to the high altitude, temperatures in Hazara are cooler than on the plains, though Abbottabad at {{convert|1,200|m}} still has maxima around 32&nbsp;\u00b0C (90&nbsp;\u00b0F) with high humidity in June and July. Further up, temperatures are cooler, often cooler than the [[Northern Areas]] valleys due to the cloudiness. In winter, temperatures are cold, with minima in January around 0&nbsp;\u00b0C (32&nbsp;\u00b0F) and much lower in the high mountains. Snowfalls are not uncommon even at lower levels.\n\nHazara lies close to the crossroads formed by the river Indus and the [[Grand Trunk Road]]. The [[Karakoram Highway]] begins at the town of Havelian and goes north through the division towards [[China]] via the Northern Areas.\n\n==Demographics and society==\nMajor ethnic groups of the Hazara region are the [[Hindkowans]] (who speak various [[Northern Hindko|Hindko dialects]]), [[Pashtuns]] (speakers of [[Pashto]]) and [[Kohistanis]] (speakers of [[Indus Kohistani]]).\n\nSome districts of Hazara have received high scores in education in [[Alif Ailaan]]'s 2017 rankings: [[Haripur District]] was ranked first in Pakistan, while [[Abbottabad District|Abbottabad]] and [[Mansehra District|Mansehra]] were in the top three for the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://elections.alifailaan.pk/rankings/| title = District Ranking| access-date = 11 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Movement for Hazara Province==\nA movement founded in 1987 by the late Malik Asif Advocate named \"Hazara Qaumi Mahaz\" (HQM) demands for separate Hazara Province.

I p. 120</ref>}}\nIn the 2nd century CE, a mythical king Raja Risalu, son of Raja [[Salbahan]] of [[Sialkot]], supposedly brought the area under his control. The local people consider him as a popular folk hero. When a Chinese pilgrim, [[Xuanzang|Hiun-Tsang]], visited this area, it was under the control of Raja Durlabhavardhana, the ruler of [[Kashmir]].\n\nThe [[Shahi]] dynasties ruled Hazara one after another. Among the Hindu Shahi dynasty rulers, Raja [[Jayapala]] is the best known. [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Mehmood of Ghazni]] defeated Raja Jayapala during his first campaign. However, there is no historical evidence that Mehmood of Ghazni ever visited or passed through Mansehra. After the fall of the Shahi dynasty, in the 11th century, the Kashmiris took control of the area under the leadership of Kalashan (1063 to 1089). From 1112 to 1120, King Susala ruled the area. In the 12th century, Asalat Khan captured this area but soon after [[Mohammad of Ghor]]'s death the Kashmiris once again regained control of Hazara.\n\n[[Amb (princely state)|Amb]] and its surrounding areas of Hazara have a long history which can be traced to Alexander the Great's invasion of India. [[Arrian]], Alexander's historian, did not indicate the exact location of [[Embolina]], but since it is known that Aoronos was on the right bank of the River Indus, the town chosen to serve as Alexander's base of supplies may with good reason be also looked for there. The mention in [[Ptolemy's Geography]] of Embolima as a town of Indo-Scythia situated on the Indus supports this theory.\n\n===Turk rule===\n[[File:Akbar.jpg|thumb|right|Akbar as a boy around 1557]]\nIn 1399, the Muslim warrior [[Timur]], on his return to [[Kabul]], stationed his Turk soldiers (who belonged to a sub-tribe of Turks, called [[Karlugh Turks]]) in Hazara to protect the important route between Kabul and Kashmir. By 1472, Prince Shahab-ud-Din came from Kabul and established his rule over the region.\n\nAt the beginning of the 18th century, Turkish rule came to an end due to the increased aggression of the [[Swati]]s and their allied forces. The most crucial attack was that of the [[Swati]]s in collusion with Syed Jalal Baba in 1703. Syed Jalal Shah was the son in law of the last ruler of Turkic dynasty, Thus [[Swati]]s ousted the Turks and captured this area. <ref>Hazara Gazetteer 1883-84</ref>\n<ref>Tareekh e Hazara</ref>\n\nDuring the period of Mughal rule, local Turkish chiefs acknowledged [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] authority. In fact, Mansehra provided the main route to [[Kashmir]] and was the most commonly used route for [[Emperor Akbar]] to travel to Kashmir.\n\n===Durrani Pashtun rule===\nHazara remained part of the Afghan [[Durrani Empire]] from the mid-18th to the early 19th centuries. Durranis considered it wise to rule the region through the local tribal chiefs. The lower Hazara plain was a separate administrative region attached to the Chacch and Attock areas of Northern [[Punjab region|Punjab]] whereas most of upper Hazara was attached to the Durrani 'Subah' or governorship of [[Kashmir]], with the exception of the Tanawal Ilaqa ([[Amb (princely state)]]) or area, which paid liege homage or tribute in exchange for comparative independence. This 'Subah' or governorship was ruled by Suba Khan Tanoli during Afghan [[Durrani Empire]]<ref>Hazara Gazetteer 1883-84</ref>\n\n===British rule===\nAfter the First Sikh War, under the terms of the Treaty of Lahore, the area was governed by [[James Abbott (Indian Army officer)|Major James Abbott]]. Abbott managed to secure and pacify the area within a year. During the [[Second Anglo-Sikh War|Second Sikh War]] Abbott and his men were cut off by the Sikh army from supplies and reinforcements from the rest of the British Army, but were able to maintain their position.<ref>[[Charles Allen (writer)|Charles Allen]], ''Soldier-Sahibs: The Men who made the North-West Frontier'', London: Abacus, 2001. pp. 193-195. {{ISBN|0-349-11456-0}}</ref>\n\nBy 1849, the British had gained control of all of Hazara. However, the western [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] tribes were occasionally rebellious. These tribes included the [[Swati]] [[clans]] of [[Allai Tehsil|Allai]], [[Batagram]] in the Nandhiar valley, [[The Black Mountain (Tor Ghar) Tribes]]. The British sent many expeditions against these tribes to crush several uprisings between 1852 and the 1920s.\n\nThe British divided [[Hazara District]] into three [[Tehsils]] (administrative subdivisions) : Mansehra, [[Abbottabad District|Abbottabad]], and [[Haripur District|Haripur]] and annexed it to the [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]]. In 1901, when the North-West Frontier Province (now [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]]) was formed, Hazara was separated from Punjab and made a part of NWFP.\n\n===Hazara Muslim League===\nFrom the early 1930s onwards, the people of Hazara gradually became active in the freedom movement for an independent Pakistan under the active leadership of renowned All India Muslim League leaders such as Shanshah e Muazzam [[Abdul Majid Khan Tarin]] of Talokar (1877\u20131939), an early member of the (then) Frontier Legislative Assembly, and others. Even before the [[All-India Muslim League]] started its movement for Pakistan in 1937, after the historic Lucknow Session of October that year, the Hazara Muslim League was properly formed and convened at the residence of Noor-Ud-Din Qureshi in Abbottabad in 1936. In this meeting the leaders of the All-India Muslim League, Nawab [[Bahadur Yar Jang]], [[Maulana Shaukat Ali]], Hamid Badayuni and others, came from India. The local people joined the movement in large numbers. In Mansehra in the same year the Muslim League was organised by Ali Gohar Khan of Chitti Dheri and Hakim Abdul Karim, who were elected the first president and general secretary of the tehsil Mansehra Muslim League. During the final phase of the movement for the creation of Pakistan, Captain Sardar Zain Muhammad Khan, OBI, and [[Jalal-ud-din Jalal Baba]] defeated their Congress rivals in the elections of 1946 from their respective rural and urban Constituencies, and politically routed the All India Congress from the region. In the Delhi Convention of Muslim League parliamentarians chaired by [[Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], which finally voted for the division of India and the creation of Pakistan, Capt. Sardar Zain Muhammad Khan represented Hazara. These Muslim League Leaders were also able to mobilize the people of this area in favour of the referendum for the creation of Pakistan. Jalal Baba, who was the main force behind Referendum in Hazara, served as the President of District Muslim League for 22 years. \n[[File:Jalal Baba's portrait.jpg|thumb|Khan Jalaluddin Khan (Jalal Baba)]]\nSometime before the [[Partition of India|independence]] of [[Pakistan]] in 1947, [[Muhammad Farid Khan|Nawab Muhammad Farid Khan Tanoli]] (KBE) of [[Amb (princely state)|Amb]] State also developed good relations with Jinnah and Nawabzada [[Liaqat Ali Khan]]as a politic move.

The areas around [[Abbottabad]] and [[Mansehra]] became the [[Hazara District]] of [[Peshawar Division]], whilst areas to the north of this became the [[Hazara Tribal Agency]]. Sandwiched between Hazara Tribal Agency and Hazara District were the small [[princely state]]s of [[State of Amb|Amb]] and [[State of Phulra|Phulra]]. This system of administration continued until 1950, when these two small states were incorporated into the Hazara district.\n\n[[File:Darband 1948, Governer frontier and PM.jpg|thumb|right|400px|In this picture seated (left to right): [[Sahibzada Mohammad Khurshid]] (first Pakistani Governor of the NWFP), [[Nawabzada Liaquat Ali Khan]] (Li\u0101qat Al\u012b Kh\u0101n) (Urdu: \u0644\u06cc\u0627\u0642\u062a \u0639\u0644\u06cc \u062e\u0627\u0646) listen (help\u00b7info) (2 October 1896 \u2013 16 October 1951) the first [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]], Nawab Sir [[Muhammad Farid Khan|Muhammad Farid Khan Tanoli]] (Nawab of Amb) and [[Begum Ra'ana Liaquat Ali Khan]] (wife of Liaquat Ali Khan).

The division was initially composed of two districts (Abbottabad, and Mansehra) but within a few years, Haripur district was spun off from Abbottabad District and Batagram District was spun off from Mansehra District.\n\nHazara remained a district until its conversion into a division in 1976. In October 1976, Mansehra was given the status of a full-fledged district, which consisted of Mansehra and Batagram tehsils. Subsequently, in July 1991, Haripur Tehsil was separated from Abbottabad and made into a district. Thus only the old Tehsil of Abbottabad remained, which was declared as Abbottabad District.\n\nIn 2000, administrative divisions were abolished and the fourth-tier districts were raised to become the new third tier of government in Pakistan. At abolition it contained the following districts:<ref>[http://www.ecp.gov.pk/content/District.html Divisions/Districts of Pakistan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060930093025/http://www.ecp.gov.pk/content/District.html |date=2006-09-30 }}<br /> Note: Although divisions as an administrative structure has been abolished, the election commission of Pakistan still groups districts under the division names</ref>\n\n* [[Abbottabad District]]\n* [[Battagram District|Batagram District]]\n* [[Haripur District]]\n* [[Upper Kohistan District]] (part of [[Kohistan District, Pakistan|Kohistan District]] until 2014)\n* [[Lower Kohistan District]] (part of [[Kohistan District, Pakistan|Kohistan District]] until 2014)\n* [[Mansehra District]]\n* [[Torghar District]] (part of [[Mansehra District]] until 2011)\n\nEventually, with all the administrative divisions being restored back in 2008, Hazara Division has returned.\n\n==Geography and climate==\n[[File:Tilla Charouni.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Tilla Charouni, On the border between Hazara and Islamabad capital territory]]\nHazara is bounded on the north and east by the [[Northern Areas]] and [[Azad Kashmir]]. To the south are the [[Islamabad Capital Territory]] and the province of [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], whilst to the west lies the rest of [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]]. The river [[Indus River|Indus]] runs through the division in a north-south line, forming much of the western border of the division. The total area of Hazara is 18,013&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.\n\nBecause it lies immediately south of the main [[Himalaya]] Range, and is exposed to moist winds from the [[Arabian Sea]], Hazara is the wettest part of Pakistan. At Abbottabad, annual rainfall averages around {{convert|1,200|mm}} but has been as high as {{convert|1,800|mm}}, whilst in parts of Mansehra District such as [[Balakot]] the mean annual rainfall is as high as {{convert|1,750|mm}} . Due to its location on the boundary between the monsoonal summer rainfall regime of [[East Asia]] and the winter-dominant [[Mediterranean climate]] of [[West Asia]], Hazara has an unusual bimodal rainfall regime, with one peak in February or March associated with frontal southwest cloudbands and another monsoonal peak in July and August. The driest months are October to December, though in the wettest parts even these months average around {{convert|40|mm}} .\n\nDue to the high altitude, temperatures in Hazara are cooler than on the plains, though Abbottabad at {{convert|1,200|m}} still has maxima around 32&nbsp;\u00b0C (90&nbsp;\u00b0F) with high humidity in June and July. Further up, temperatures are cooler, often cooler than the [[Northern Areas]] valleys due to the cloudiness. In winter, temperatures are cold, with minima in January around 0&nbsp;\u00b0C (32&nbsp;\u00b0F) and much lower in the high mountains. Snowfalls are not uncommon even at lower levels.\n\nHazara lies close to the crossroads formed by the river Indus and the [[Grand Trunk Road]]. The [[Karakoram Highway]] begins at the town of Havelian and goes north through the division towards [[China]] via the Northern Areas.\n\n==Demographics and society==\nMajor ethnic groups of the Hazara region are the [[Hindkowans]] (who speak various [[Northern Hindko|Hindko dialects]]), [[Pashtuns]] (speakers of [[Pashto]]) and [[Kohistanis]] (speakers of [[Indus Kohistani]]).\n\nSome districts of Hazara have received high scores in education in [[Alif Ailaan]]'s 2017 rankings: [[Haripur District]] was ranked first in Pakistan, while [[Abbottabad District|Abbottabad]] and [[Mansehra District|Mansehra]] were in the top three for the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://elections.alifailaan.pk/rankings/| title = District Ranking| access-date = 11 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Movement for Hazara Province==\nA movement founded in 1987 by the late Malik Asif Advocate named \"Hazara Qaumi Mahaz\" (HQM) demands for separate Hazara Province.

The arrangements behind the scenes were perfect, the dressing rooms good, the attendants well-chosen, the wings kept clear of all intruders, no strangers or crutch and toothpick loafers allowed behind to flirt with the ballet-girls, only a very few private friends were allowed the privilege of visiting the green-room, which was as handsomely furnished as any nobleman's drawing-room, and those friends appeared always in evening dress....There was great propriety and decorum observed in every part of the establishment, great harmony, general content prevailed in every department of the theatre, and universal regret was felt when the admirable managers were compelled to resign their government.\n</blockquote>\nAnother contemporary actor George Vandenhoff in ''Dramatic Reminiscences'' also bears testimony to the fact that: \u2018To Vestris's honour, she was not only scrupulously careful not to offend propriety by word or action, but she knew very well how to repress any attempt at double-entendre, or doubtful insinuation, in others. The green-room in Covent Garden was a most agreeable lounging place, from which was banished every word or allusion that would not be tolerated in a drawing-room.\u2019<ref>George Vandenhoff, ''Dramatic Reminiscences; or, actors and actresses in England and America'', London, Thomas W. Cooper, 1860, p. 47 (accessible for free online in [https://openlibrary.org/books/OL7112593M/Dramatic_reminiscences openlibrary.org])</ref>\n\nIn the late 1840s Vestris began to appear less and less on the stage because of the debts she and her husband owed and also because she began to raise her late sister's children.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Her last performance (1854) was for Mathews' benefit, in an adaptation of [[Delphine de Girardin|Madame de Girardin]]'s ''La Joie fait peur'', called ''Sunshine through Clouds''.  She died in London in 1856.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nHer musical accomplishments and education were not sufficient to distinguish her in grand opera, and in high [[comedy]] she was only moderately successful. But in plays like ''Loan of a Lover'', ''Paul Pry'', ''Naval Engagements'', etc., she was \"delightfully arch and bewitching.\"{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} However, many an observer (and [[Henry Fothergill Chorley|Chorley]] among them) \"never quite forgave her for not becoming the greatest English operatic contralto of her age:\"<ref>''Grove'', p. 980</ref>\n{{Quote\n|text=About the same time it was that Madame Vestris made her last appearance on our Italian stage.

She managed theatres; took plays on tour with a motley crew of actors, actresses and all the support staff; and only remarried, after her disastrous early experience with Vestris, when forced to by American authorities in order to allow her to bring her tour across their borders.{{Dubious |1=Vestris's second marriage|reason=apparent inconsistency with Pearce (cited source) and [http://www.oxforddnb.com/templates/article.jsp?articleid=18331&back=,1592,1592 Jacky Bratton] about Vestris's motives for getting married |date=January 2014}} Lucia Elizabeth Vestris was a prominent figure in the history of British theatre and customs in the nineteenth century.<ref>Pearce, ''passim''</ref>\n\nShe is buried at [[Kensal Green Cemetery]].<ref name=Paths>{{cite book|title=Paths of Glory|date=1997|publisher=Friends of Kensal Green Cemetery|page=102}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n;Bibliography\n*{{EB1911|wstitle = Vestris, Lucia Elizabeth |volume=27 }}\n*William H.
