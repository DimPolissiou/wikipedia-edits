It premiered on the [[NBC]] [[Television Network]] on October 11, 1975, under the title ''NBC's Saturday Night''. The show often satirizes contemporary American popular culture and politics. ''Saturday Night Live'' features a two-tiered cast: the repertory members, also known as the \"Not Ready for Prime-Time Players,\" and newer cast members, known as \"Featured Players.\" Each week, the show features a host, often a well-known celebrity, who delivers an opening [[monologue]] and performs in sketches with the cast. A musical guest is also invited to perform several sets (usually two, occasionally more). Every so often a host or musical guest fills both roles. With the exception of [[Saturday Night Live (season 7)|season 7]] and several other rare cases, the show begins with a [[cold open]] that ends with someone's [[breaking character]] and proclaiming \"[[Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!]]\"\n\n''Saturday Night Live'' is one of the [[List of longest running United States television series|longest running]] network programs in American television history, with more than 800 episodes broadcast over five [[Timeline_of_the_20th_century|decade]]s.

It premiered on [[NBC]], a [[terrestrial television|terrestrial]] [[television network]], on October 11, 1975, under the title ''NBC's Saturday Night''. The show often satirizes contemporary American popular culture and politics. ''Saturday Night Live'' features a two-tiered cast: the repertory members, also known as the \"Not Ready for Prime-Time Players,\" and newer cast members, known as \"Featured Players.\" Each week, the show features a host, often a well-known celebrity, who delivers an opening [[monologue]] and performs in sketches with the cast. A musical guest is also invited to perform several sets (usually two, occasionally more). Every so often a host or musical guest fills both roles. With the exception of [[Saturday Night Live (season 7)|season 7]] and several other rare cases, the show begins with a [[cold open]] that ends with someone's [[breaking character]] and proclaiming \"[[Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!]]\"\n\n''Saturday Night Live'' is one of the [[List of longest running United States television series|longest running]] network programs in American television history, with more than 800 episodes broadcast over five [[Timeline_of_the_20th_century|decade]]s. A number of the show's sketches have been developed into [[feature film]]s, including ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'', ''[[Wayne's World]]'', ''[[A Night at the Roxbury]]'', ''[[Superstar (1999 film)|Superstar]]'', ''[[Coneheads]]'', and ''[[MacGruber (film)|MacGruber]]''.\n\nSeasons 1 through 5 are [[List of Saturday Night Live DVD releases|available on DVD]] in [[DVD region code#1|Region{{nbsp}}1]].

But the bust that followed in the early 1950s, caused by the [[Korean War]], the advent of television, and a retrenchment in MLB farm systems, also buffeted the WA. It finally disbanded after the [[1954 in baseball|1954 season]], its champion Topeka club, a [[Chicago White Sox]] affiliate, drawing half the number of fans the team had drawn during the late 1940s.\n\n==References==\n*Johnson, Lloyd and Wolff, Miles, ed., ''The Encyclopedia of Minor League Baseball.''

It was established by [[William Ewart Gladstone]] in 1882 to provide club facilities for [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] campaigners among the newly enlarged electorate following the [[Third Reform Act]] in 1884. The club's [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] building on the Embankment of the river [[Thames]] is the second-largest club-house ever built. Designed by [[Alfred Waterhouse]], it was completed in 1887.<ref name=\"autogenerated1979\">Lejeune, Anthony, with Malcolm Lewis, ''The Gentlemen's Clubs of London'' (Bracken Books, 1979 reprinted 1984 and 1987) chapter on National Liberal Club.</ref> Its facilities include a dining room, a bar, function rooms, a billiards room, a [[smoking room]], a library and an outdoor riverside terrace. It is located at [[Whitehall Court|Whitehall Place]], close to the [[Houses of Parliament]], the [[Thames Embankment]] and [[Trafalgar Square]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years===\nThe genesis of the club lay with Liberal party activist (and later MP) [[Arthur John Williams]], who proposed the creation of such a club at a Special General Meeting of the short-lived Century Club on 14 May 1882, so as to provide \"a home for democracy, void of the class distinction associated with the [[Devonshire Club|Devonshire]] and [[Reform Club]]s\". The first full meeting of the new club was held on 16 November 1882, at the Westminster Palace Hotel on Victoria Street. The Century Club itself then merged into the NLC at the end of the year.<ref>''[[Cornhill Magazine]]'', Volume 88, Smith, Elder and Co. (1903), pp. 314, 319, states that the Century Club merged into the NLC \"'''more than''' twenty years ago.\"</ref> In its early years, the club declared its objects to be: \n::1. The provision of an inexpensive meeting place for Liberals and their friends from all over the country.\n::2. The furtherance of the Liberal cause.\n::3. The foundation of a political and historical library as a memorial to Gladstone and his work.<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\">Peter Harris, \"A Meeting Place for Liberals\", ''Journal of Liberal History'', No. 51, Summer 2006, pp. 18\u201323.</ref>\nAn initial circular for subscribers meant that by the end of 1882, 2,500 men from over 500 towns and districts had already signed up for the new club, and membership would reach 6,500 by the time the clubhouse opened in 1887.<ref name=\"autogenerated1925\">Robert Steven, ''The National Liberal Club: Politics and Persons'' (Robert Holden, London, 1925), 91pp.</ref>\n\n[[File:Elliott & Fry10a.jpg|thumb|left|Former Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]] was the club's first President. A keen feller of trees in his spare time, his axe is still on display in the club smoking room today, along with a chest made from an oak tree cut down by Gladstone.]]\nThe club's foundation stone was laid by Gladstone on 9 November 1884, when he declared \"Speaking generally, I should say there could not be a less interesting occasion than the laying of the foundation-stone of a Club in London. For, after all, what are the Clubs of London? I am afraid little else than temples of luxury and ease. This, however, is a club of a very different character\", and envisioned the club as a popular institution for the mass electorate.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">G. W. E. Russell, ''Fifteen Chapters of Autobiography''(Thomas Nelson, London, undated), Chapter XXII.</ref> However, another of the club's founders, [[George W. E. Russell|G. W. E. Russell]], noted \"We certainly never foresaw the palatial pile of terra-cotta and glazed tiles which now bears that name. Our modest object was to provide a central meeting-place for Metropolitan and provincial Liberals, where all the comforts of life should be attainable at what are called 'popular prices'\", but added \"at the least, we meant our Club to be a place of \"ease\" to the Radical toiler. But Gladstone insisted that it was to be a workshop dedicated to strenuous labour.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> Funds for the clubhouse were raised by selling 40,000 shares of \u00a35 each, in a Limited Liability Company, with the unusual stipulation that \"No shareholder should have more than ''ten'' votes\", so as to prevent a few wealthy men from dominating the club.<ref name=\"autogenerated1925\"/> However, this only raised \u00a370,000,<ref name=\"autogenerated2012\"/> and so an additional \u00a352,400 was raised for the construction of the clubhouse by the Liberal Central Association.<ref>Roy Douglas, ''The History of the Liberal Party, 1895\u20131970'' (Sidgwick & Jackson, London, 1971), p. 17.</ref> The remaining \u00a330,000 necessary was raised by mortgage debentures.<ref name=\"autogenerated2012\"/>\n\nIn the five years between the club's establishment and completion of the building in 1887, it occupied temporary premises on the corner of [[Northumberland Avenue]] and Trafalgar Square. During this time, a [[parliamentary question]] was asked in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] about the [[White Ensign]] being raised on the club's flagpole as part of a prank.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1883/may/04/the-national-liberal-club |title=THE NATIONAL LIBERAL CLUB.

NLC members flocked to the windows to watch [[George Bernard Shaw]] (a member of the club) address the demonstration, and later in the day, witnessed the bloodshed which ensued.<ref>[http://www1.webng.com/timesofshaw/articles/1925.html 'Portrait of George Bernard Shaw'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625025358/http://www1.webng.com/timesofshaw/articles/1925.html |date=25 June 2011 }}, ''The Times'', 1 November 1925.</ref>\n\nIn its late-19th-century heyday, its membership was primarily political, but had a strong journalistic and even bohemian character. Members were known to finish an evening's dining by diving into the Thames.<ref name=\"autogenerated1925\"/> Of the club's political character, George Bernard Shaw remarked at a debate in the club, \"I have never yet met a member of the National Liberal Club who did not intend to get into Parliament at some time, except those who, like our chairman [[Charles Wynn-Carington, 1st Marquess of Lincolnshire|Lord Carrington]], are there already.\"<ref>George Bernard Shaw, 'The Case for Equality: speech at a National Liberal Club debate of 1913', in ed. James Fuchs, ''The Socialism of Shaw'' (New York, 1926), p. 58.</ref>\n\nOn the club's launch, it represented all factions of liberalism, but within four years it was rocked by the [[Government of Ireland Bill 1886|Home Rule Crisis of 1886]], which saw the [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionists]] led by [[Joseph Chamberlain]] and the [[Spencer Cavendish, 8th Duke of Devonshire|Marquess of Hartington]] (both of whom had been founder members of the NLC) secede from the party and eventually go into alliance with the Conservatives. Indeed, Chamberlain had been one of the NLC's most enthusiastic promoters upon its launch. At the 1884 ceremony of Gladstone's foundation-stone-laying for the club, Hartington had argued that the club would be the future home of Chamberlain's Radical [[Birmingham Caucus]], and Chamberlain pointedly refused to contradict him.<ref>Sir Alexander Mackintosh, ''Joseph Chamberlain: An Honest Biography'' (Hodder and Stoughton, London, 1914), p. 327.</ref> Chamberlain himself resigned in 1886, shortly after the Home Rule split, Hartington and other prominent Liberal Unionists followed early in 1887,<ref name=\"autogenerated1891\">Hamilton Fyfe and [[Joseph Irving]] (eds.), ''The Annals of Our Time ...: pt. 1. 20 June 1887 \u2013 December 1890'' (Macmillan, London, 1891).</ref> and when a further 130 Unionists simultaneously seceded from the club in 1889, the ''[[Scots Observer]]'' called it \"one of the most important events that has recently occurred in home politics\", due to its ramifications for the Liberal Party breaking in two.<ref>''The Scots Observer'', Vol. 1 (1889), p. 58.</ref>\n\nThe club enjoyed a reputation for radicalism, and H. V. Emy records that Radicals secured \n{{quote|a distinct success when the Radical wing of the National Liberal Club (NLC) captured the club's organisation in the summer of 1897 and elected a new political committee with [[Henry Labouch\u00e8re|[Henry] Labouchere]] as the chairman and [[Harold Reckitt|H. J. Reckitt]] as secretary. The Committee itself included [[Robert Reid, 1st Earl Loreburn|Sir Robert Reid]], [[Philip Stanhope, 1st Baron Weardale|[Philip] Stanhope]], [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Herbert Samuel]], [[Rufus Isaacs, 1st Marquess of Reading|Rufus Isaacs]] and W. F. Thompson, the editor of ''[[Reynold's News]]''. The Committee wrote an open letter to the constituencies, asking them for their opinions on policy, designating several areas where opinion would be welcome. By November, the replies indicated that the weight of opinion lay with the democratisation of Parliament, involving the abolition of the Lords' veto, reform of registration and electoral law, and devolution. Amongst \"other prominent reforms\" were included all the major issues of the day (except nationalisation).

On [[Armistice Day]] 1924, over one hundred defeated Liberal candidates met at the club to express their anger at Lloyd George's failure to use his infamous \"[[Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925|Lloyd George fund]]\" to help the Liberals in [[1924 United Kingdom general election|the disastrous general election campaign one month earlier]].<ref>[[Frank Owen (politician)|Frank Owen]], ''Tempestuous Journey: Lloyd George, His Life and Times'' (Hutchinson, London, 1954), p. 684.</ref> After the [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929 general election]], the first meeting of the newly expanded Parliamentary Liberal Party was held at the club, with all MPs except one (the independently minded [[Rhys Hopkin Morris]]) re-electing Lloyd George as Liberal Party Leader.<ref>J. Graham Jones, ''David Lloyd George and Welsh Liberalism'' (National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth, 2010), p. 271.</ref>\n\nIn 1932, the club first introduced non-political membership (now called Ordinary Membership). [[Michael Meadowcroft]] explains that this was done to provide, \"membership for Liberals who, by reason of their employment, such as judges, military officers or senior civil servants, were not permitted to divulge their politics\", and so who had been previously debarred by the club's insistence on all members signing a declaration of Liberal politics.<ref name=\"autogenerated2012\"/> This continues to this day, with Ordinary Members signing a pledge that they will \"not use the club or...membership thereof for political activities adverse to Liberalism\", and not having full voting rights at Annual General Meetings, but otherwise enjoying the full benefits of club membership.<ref>National Liberal Club application form, 2011.</ref>\n\n===World War II===\nOn 11 May 1941 the club suffered a direct hit by a [[Luftwaffe]] bomb during [[the Blitz]], which utterly destroyed the central staircase and caused considerable damage elsewhere. The \u00a3150,000 cost of reconstructing the staircase in 1950 placed a considerable strain on the club's finances, although generous support from the [[War Damage Commission]] helped to fund the new staircase.<ref>Short cinema documentary, ''[[Look at Life (British cinema series)|Look at Life: Members Only]]'' (1965).</ref> In the nine-year interim between the bomb blast and the rebuilding of the staircase, members had to use the stairs of the club's turret tower, often taking highly circuitous routes around the vast clubhouse.\n\nOne of the items damaged in the blast was the 1915 portrait of [[Winston Churchill]] (a member of the club), by [[Ernest Townsend]]. Ironically, after 25 years of being hidden from sight, it had only just been put on display the year before. Painted in the year of the [[Dardanelles Campaign]], Churchill was soon unavailable for unveiling the portrait as he went into exile in the trenches. After his return, his strong support for the [[United Kingdom coalition government (1916\u20131922)|Lloyd George coalition]] meant that from 1916 he proved to be ''persona non-grata'' at the club, and this only increased after he left the Liberal Party in 1924. Thus from 1915 to 1940, the painting was held by the club in storage. When Churchill became Prime Minister in May 1940, the club rushed out the painting and put it on display in the main lobby (where it still hangs today). It was bombed after one year, suffering a diagonal gash down the middle. The painting was then painstakingly restored, and Churchill re-unveiled it himself on 22 July 1943, at a ceremony also attended by [[Clementine Churchill, Baroness Spencer-Churchill|his wife]] (a lifelong Liberal), Liberal Leader [[Sir Archibald Sinclair]] (a friend and colleague of over 30 years, then serving in Churchill's cabinet), lifelong friend [[Violet Bonham Carter|Lady Violet Bonham Carter]], Club chairman [[James Meston, 1st Baron Meston|Lord Meston]] and cartoonist [[David Low (cartoonist)|David Low]].<ref name=\"autogenerated133\"/>\n\n===Post-war era===\nThe fortunes of the NLC have mirrored those of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] \u2013 as the Liberals declined as a national force in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, so did the NLC. However, despite the Liberals' national decline, the NLC remained a focus for debate.\n\nIn the early 1950s, it was a centre of anti-ID card sentiment, and [[Harry Willcock]], a member who successfully campaigned for the abolition of ID cards, tore his up in front of the club as a publicity stunt in 1951. He also died in the club during a debate held there{{dub|ODNB has \"at a meeting of the Eighty Club at the Reform Club\"|date=June 2018}} on 12 December 1952, with his last word being \"Freedom.\"<ref>Plaque in the NLC smoking room.</ref>\n\nIt was at a debate at the club in 1971 that [[Yale]] professor [[James Tobin]] first publicly voiced his proposal for a ''[[Tobin tax]]'' on financial transactions.<ref>Shirreff, David.

Thorpe later credited this system with giving him more time to think of answers to questions, and it helped to keep the Liberal campaign both distinctive and modern.<ref>[[Jeremy Thorpe]], ''In My Own Time: Reminiscences of a Liberal Leader'' (Politico's, London, 1999), p. 107.</ref> Further Liberal election campaigns of the 1970s and 1980s would retain the idea of a daily press conference at the NLC, but with live participants rather than a TV link-up to the party leader.<ref>Ivor Crewe and Anthony King, ''SDP: The Birth, Life and Death of the Social Democratic Party'' (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1995), p. 200.</ref>\n\n[[File:The National Liberal Club interior (4843463497).jpg|thumb|left|The interior]]\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, all London clubs were in serious decline,<ref name=\"autogenerated1979\"/> and the NLC was no exception. By the 1970s the club was in a serious state of disrepair, its membership dwindling, and its finances losing almost a thousand pounds a week. In 1976 Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe handed over the club to Canadian businessman George Marks, styling himself [[George de Chabris]] (and, more improbably,  \"His Serene Holiness the Prince de Chabris\", which he claimed was \"a Catholic title\"), who, unknown to Thorpe, was a [[confidence trick]]ster. \"De Chabris\" claimed to be a multi-millionaire willing to funnel money into the club (although both his wealth and his willingness to finance the club turned out to be untrue), and he spent nine months running the club, relaxing membership rules and bringing in more income, but also moving his family in rent-free, running several fraudulent businesses from its premises, paying for a sports car and his children's private school fees from the club's accounts, and he eventually left in a hurry owing the club \u00a360,000, even emptying out the cash till of the day's takings as he went. He eventually agreed to pay back half of that sum in instalments. In his time at the club he also sold it a painting for \u00a310,000, when it was valued at less than \u00a31,000.<ref>Lewis Chester, [[Magnus Linklater]] and David May, ''Jeremy Thorpe: A Secret Life'' (Fontana, 1979), pp. 190\u2013194, for a detailed description of de Chabris' involvement in the club in the 1970s.

The pretext given was that the club could no longer afford to pay the Librarian's wages, and that it did not want to leave such valuable material unguarded.<ref>The Times, Wednesday, 10 November 1976; pg. 1; Issue 59857; col G; The Times, Friday, 19 November 1976; pg. 4; Issue 59865; col G.</ref> [[Ian Bradley]] described it as \"a derisory sum\" for the sale, particularly in light of the unique collection of accumulated candidates' manifestos from 19th-century general elections.<ref>The Times, Thursday, 21 October 1982; pg. 8; Issue 61368; col B.</ref> Until its sale, it had been, as Peter Harris observed, \"The most extensive of the Club libraries of London.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\"/> The collection is still housed at Bristol today. However, the papers referring to the history of the club itself were returned to the NLC in the 1990s, as they had not been included in the sale, and had been sent to Bristol by accident.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nAfter the 1977 dismissal of de Chabris, a 1978 rescue package by [[Lawrence Robson|Sir Lawrence Robson]] (a former Liberal Party President and parliamentary candidate, co-founder and partner of [[Robson Rhodes]], and husband of Liberal peer [[Inga-Stina Robson|Baroness Robson]]) did much to stabilise the club and secure its future \u2013 to this day the club honours Sir Lawrence with a portrait in the Smoking Room, and one of its function rooms has been renamed the Lawrence Robson Room.\n\nAs the Liberal Party's lease on its headquarters expired in 1977, the party organisation moved to the upper floors of the NLC, the negotiations being arranged by \"de Chabris\". The Liberals occupied a suite of rooms on the second floor, and a series of offices converted from bedrooms on the upper floors. The party continued to operate from the NLC until 1988, when it merged with the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] to form the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], and moved to occupy the SDP's old headquarters in Cowley Street. During this time, party workers were known to avail themselves of the club downstairs, and the NLC bar became known as the \"Liberal Party's 'local'\" and a Liberal Party song \"Down at the Old NLC\" was written in response to this:\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nCome, come, roll up your trouser leg\nDown at the old NLC.\nCome, come, stuff your coat on the peg,\nDown at the old NLC.\nThere to get your apron on:\nLearn the secret organ song;\nBend your thumb when you shake hands.\nCome, come, drinking till the dinner gong,\nDown at the old NLC.</poem>|1985.

K. Chesterton]], [[Jerome K. Jerome]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Bram Stoker]], [[Dylan Thomas]], [[H. G. Wells]] and [[Leonard Woolf]]; several of whom featured the club in some of their works of literature.\n\nAdditionally, the [[Authors' Club]], founded in 1891 in neighbouring [[Whitehall Court]], lodged with the National Liberal Club between 1966 and 1976, and has done so again since 2014.\n\n*[[G. K. Chesterton]], who was a member, mentions it as a setting in the short story \"The Notable Conduct of Professor Chadd\" in his collection ''[[The Club of Queer Trades]]'' (1905), with the narrator having a one-hour conversation on politics and God with a judge he meets on the club's balcony.<ref>[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1696/1696-h/1696-h.htm G.

Wells also gave a lengthy description of the NLC in his novel ''[[The New Machiavelli]]'' (1911), discussing the narrator's experience of visiting the club during the 1906 general election:\n\n[[File:H. G. Wells, c.1890.jpg|thumb|NLC member [[H. G. Wells]] painted a vivid, detailed portrait of the club at the time of the [[1906 United Kingdom general election|Liberal landslide of 1906]].]]\n{{cquote|I engaged myself to speak at one or two London meetings, and lunched at the [[Reform Club|Reform]], which was fairly tepid, and dined and spent one or two tumultuous evenings at the National Liberal Club, which was in active eruption. The National Liberal became feverishly congested towards midnight as the results of the counting came dropping in. A big green-baize screen had been fixed up at one end of the large smoking-room with the names of the constituencies that were voting that day, and directly the figures came to hand, up they went, amidst cheers that at last lost their energy through sheer repetition, whenever there was record of a Liberal gain. I don't remember what happened when there was a Liberal loss; I don't think that any were announced while I was there.\n\nHow packed and noisy the place was, and what a reek of tobacco and [[whisky]] [[vapor|fumes]] we made! Everybody was excited and talking, making waves of harsh confused sound that beat upon one's ears, and every now and then hoarse voices would shout for someone to speak. Our little set was much in evidence. Both the Cramptons were in, Lewis, Bunting Harblow. We gave brief addresses attuned to this excitement and the late hour, amidst much enthusiasm.\n\n\"Now we can DO things!\" I said amidst a rapture of applause. Men I did not know from Adam held up glasses and nodded to me in solemn fuddled approval as I came down past them into the crowd again.\n\nMen were betting whether the Unionists would lose more or less than two hundred seats.\n\n\"I wonder just what we shall do with it all\", I heard one sceptic speculating....}}\n:Wells later described the State Opening of the new 1906 parliament:\n\n{{cquote|It is one of my vivid memories from this period, the sudden outbreak of [[top hat|silk hats]] in the [[smoking room|smoking-room]] of the National Liberal Club. At first I thought there must have been a funeral. Familiar faces that one had grown to know under [[trilby|soft felt hats]], under [[bowler hat|bowlers]], under [[fedora (hat)|liberal-minded wide brims]], and above artistic [[necktie|ties]] and [[tweed jacket]]s, suddenly met one, staring with the stern gaze of self-consciousness, from under silk hats of incredible glossiness. There was a disposition to wear the hat much too forward, I thought, for a good Parliamentary style.}}\n:About the club more broadly, Wells' narrator reflected:\n\n{{cquote|My discontents with the Liberal party and my mental exploration of the quality of party generally is curiously mixed up with certain impressions of things and people in the National Liberal Club. The National Liberal Club is Liberalism made visible in the flesh\u2014and [[salt glaze pottery|Doultonware]]. It is an extraordinary big club done in a bold, wholesale, shiny, marbled style, richly furnished with numerous paintings, steel engravings, busts, and full-length statues of the late Mr. Gladstone; and its spacious dining-rooms, its long, hazy, crowded smoking-room with innumerable little tables and groups of men in armchairs, its magazine room and library upstairs, have just that undistinguished and unconcentrated diversity which is for me the Liberal note. The pensive member sits and hears perplexing dialects and even fragments of foreign speech, and among the clustering masses of less insistent whites his roving eye catches profiles and complexions that send his mind afield to [[Calcutta]] or [[Rangoon]] or the [[West Indies]] or [[Sierra Leone]] or [[Cape of Good Hope|the Cape]]....\n\nI was not infrequently that pensive member. I used to go to the Club to doubt about Liberalism. About two o'clock in the day the great smoking-room is crowded with countless little groups. They sit about small round tables, or in circles of chairs, and the haze of tobacco seems to prolong the great narrow place, with its pillars and bays, to infinity. Some of the groups are big, as many as a dozen men talk in loud tones; some are [[duologue]]s, and there is always a sprinkling of lonely, dissociated men. At first one gets an impression of men going from group to group and as it were linking them, but as one watches closely one finds that these men just visit three or four groups at the outside, and know nothing of the others. One begins to perceive more and more distinctly that one is dealing with a sort of human [[mosaic]]; that each patch in that great place is of a different quality and colour from the next and never to be mixed with it. Most clubs have a common link, a lowest common denominator in the Club Bore, who spares no one, but even the National Liberal bores are specialised and sectional. As one looks round one sees here a clump of men from the [[North of England|North Country]] or the [[Staffordshire Potteries|Potteries]], here an island of [[South London]] politicians, here a couple of young [[Jews]] ascendant from [[Whitechapel]], here a circle of journalists and writers, here a group of Irish politicians, here two [[East India]]ns, here a priest or so, here a clump of old-fashioned Protestants, here a little knot of eminent [[rationalism|Rationalists]] indulging in a [[blasphemous]] story '''sotto voce'''. Next to them are a group of [[anglicise]]d [[Germans]] and highly specialised [[chess (game)|chess-players]], and then two of the oddest-looking persons\u2014bulging with documents and intent upon extraordinary business transactions over long cigars ...\n\nI would listen to a stormy sea of babblement, and try to extract some constructive intimations. Every now and then I got a whiff of politics. It was clear they were against [[House of Lords|the Lords]]\u2014against [[plutocrats]]\u2014against [[press baron|Cossington's]] newspapers\u2014against the [[brewery|brewers]].... It was tremendously clear what they were against. The trouble was to find out what on earth they were for!...\n\nAs I sat and thought, the streaked and mottled pillars and wall, the various views, aspects, and portraits of [[William Ewart Gladstone|Mr. and]] [[Catherine Gladstone|Mrs. Gladstone]], the partitions of polished [[mahogany]], the yellow-[[waistcoat|vested]] waiters, would dissolve and vanish, and I would have a vision of this sample of miscellaneous men of limited, diverse interests and a universal littleness of imagination enlarged, unlimited, no longer a sample but a community, spreading, stretching out to infinity\u2014all in little groups and duologues and circles, all with their special and narrow concerns, all with their backs to most of the others.\n\nWhat but a common antagonism would ever keep these multitudes together? I understood why modern [[electioneering]] is more than half of it [[denunciation]]. Let us condemn, if possible, let us obstruct and deprive, but not let us do. There is no real appeal to the commonplace mind in \"Let us do.\" That calls for the creative imagination, and few have been accustomed to respond to that call. The other merely needs jealousy and bate, of which there are great and easily accessible reservoirs in every human heart.<ref>H. G.

The night porter will hunt out a pair of pyjamas and escort you up the lift. Oh, he's used to it. He gets politicians from [[Bradford]] and such places dropping in at all hours.

Members are in one of two categories: either Members, who sign a declaration that they shall not use the club's facilities or their membership for 'political activities adverse to Liberalism', or Political Members, who sign the same declaration, plus an additional declaration that they are a Liberal in their politics, in exchange for additional voting rights within the club. Non-political Membership was first introduced in 1932, to allow Liberals to join when they had been barred up until that point, as several occupations such as judges, army officers and senior civil servants specifically forbade political declarations.<ref>Michael Meadowcroft, \"Celebrating 130 Years of High Victorian Style and Elegance\", ''NLC News'', Issue 63, pp. 13\u201314.</ref>\n\nIt is one of the few London clubs to contain another club within\u2014since 1990, the NLC has also been home to the [[Savage Club]], which lodges in some rooms on the ground floor.\n\nIn return for a collective subscription, members of the [[Mill Hill School|Old Millhillian's Club]] (OMC) have also been allowed to use the NLC clubhouse since 1968, when their own neighbouring [[Whitehall Court]] clubhouse closed down.\n\n===Ethnic minority members since the 1880s===\nIn keeping with its liberal roots, it was one of the first gentlemen's club to allow ethnic minorities as members (a handful of other clubs did so as well, including the [[East India Club]] whose members included Sir [[Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy]]). The first recorded ethnic minority member of the NLC, [[Dadabhai Naoroji]] was admitted in 1885, when the club was less than three years old, and spurred on by Club Secretary [[William Digby (writer)|William Digby]], by the late 1880s, the club had a large overseas membership, particularly concentrated in India and among Indian nationals resident in London.<ref>Mira Matikkala, \u2018Anti-Imperialism, Englishness, andEmpire in late-Victorian Britain\u2019 (Cambridge, PhD, 2006).</ref> Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the first Governor General of Pakistan, and a successful barrister, was a member of the National Liberal Club.\n\n[[File:Alan Beith MP Liverpool.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Long-standing Liberal and Lib Dem MP [[Alan Beith|Sir Alan Beith]] has been the club's President since 2008.]]\n\n===Women members since the 1960s===\nSince the club's 1882 foundation, women had always been allowed to use the club as visitors, but remained barred from membership until the 1960s, when it became one of the first \"gentlemen's clubs\" to admit women members.

The club's first full women members in 1976 were Christina Baron and Joyce Arram.\n\n===Dress code===\nWhen the club was originally launched in 1882, like every other London club of the era it had no prescriptive dress code. In 1888, a simple requirement was introduced that \"No member shall appear in any public rooms of the Club in a dressing gown, slippers, or other ''[[wiktionary:deshabille|deshabille]]''.\" Beyond that, the club's only dress code was a request in the Regulations that members \"dress and conduct themselves in a manner consistent with civilised standards\", but precisely how members chose to observe that remained a matter of considerable personal interpretation.<ref name=\"meadowcroftdresscode2017\">Michael Meadowcroft, \"Breaking the Code\", ''NLC News'', Issue 72, April 2017, pp. 22-23.</ref> Indeed, the club's first official history, in 1925, noted that an unusual feature of the NLC was the way in which it enjoyed far more casual dress than other London clubs, with members turning up in their working clothes, and it singled out, \"the practical tabooing of evening dress, which assisted in securing the attendance of the House of Commons and Press Gallery men for at least part of the social evening.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1925\"/>  This absence of any prescriptive dress code remained the club's ''modus operandi'' from 1882 until 1979, when the Club's flurry of recent scandals led the General Committee to impose a strict jacket-and-tie dress code for men, emulating the jacket-and-tie dress codes introduced in other London clubs in the 1950s, which the NLC had previously held out against. No vote of the membership was held on the new dress code.<ref name=\"meadowcroftdresscode2017\"/>\n\nThis strict jacket-and-tie dress code remained in place for 40 years after the General Committee's 1979 decision, although a 2005 review led the club to permit men to remove their jackets on the club's terrace.<ref name=\"meadowcroftdresscode2017\"/>\n\nIn May 2018, the Club's Annual General Meeting voted by 49 to 36 in favour of a trial relaxation of the dress code in July and August of that year, removing the jacket-and-tie requirement from every part of the club except the Dining Room.<ref name=\"berridge2018\">Janet Berridge, \"National Liberal Club to trial relaxation of the dress code\", ''Lib Dem Voice'', 19 May 2018, https://www.libdemvoice.org/national-liberal-club-to-trial-relaxation-of-dress-code-57555.html</ref> It was the first time in 39 years that members had been permitted a formal vote on the dress code.

It was established by [[William Ewart Gladstone]] in 1882 to provide club facilities for [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] campaigners among the newly enlarged electorate following the [[Third Reform Act]] in 1884. The club's [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] building on the Embankment of the river [[Thames]] is the second-largest club-house ever built. Designed by [[Alfred Waterhouse]], it was completed in 1887.<ref name=\"autogenerated1979\">Lejeune, Anthony, with Malcolm Lewis, ''The Gentlemen's Clubs of London'' (Bracken Books, 1979 reprinted 1984 and 1987) chapter on National Liberal Club.</ref> Its facilities include a dining room, a bar, function rooms, a billiards room, a [[smoking room]], a library and an outdoor riverside terrace. It is located at [[Whitehall Court|Whitehall Place]], close to the [[Houses of Parliament]], the [[Thames Embankment]] and [[Trafalgar Square]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years===\nThe genesis of the club lay with Liberal party activist (and later MP) [[Arthur John Williams]], who proposed the creation of such a club at a Special General Meeting of the short-lived Century Club on 14 May 1882, so as to provide \"a home for democracy, void of the class distinction associated with the [[Devonshire Club|Devonshire]] and [[Reform Club]]s\". The first full meeting of the new club was held on 16 November 1882, at the Westminster Palace Hotel on Victoria Street. The Century Club itself then merged into the NLC at the end of the year.<ref>''[[Cornhill Magazine]]'', Volume 88, Smith, Elder and Co. (1903), pp. 314, 319, states that the Century Club merged into the NLC \"'''more than''' twenty years ago.\"</ref> In its early years, the club declared its objects to be: \n::1. The provision of an inexpensive meeting place for Liberals and their friends from all over the country.\n::2. The furtherance of the Liberal cause.\n::3. The foundation of a political and historical library as a memorial to Gladstone and his work.<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\">Peter Harris, \"A Meeting Place for Liberals\", ''Journal of Liberal History'', No. 51, Summer 2006, pp. 18\u201323.</ref>\nAn initial circular for subscribers meant that by the end of 1882, 2,500 men from over 500 towns and districts had already signed up for the new club, and membership would reach 6,500 by the time the clubhouse opened in 1887.<ref name=\"autogenerated1925\">Robert Steven, ''The National Liberal Club: Politics and Persons'' (Robert Holden, London, 1925), 91pp.</ref>\n\n[[File:Elliott & Fry10a.jpg|thumb|left|Former Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]] was the club's first President. A keen feller of trees in his spare time, his axe is still on display in the club smoking room today, along with a chest made from an oak tree cut down by Gladstone.]]\nThe club's foundation stone was laid by Gladstone on 9 November 1884, when he declared \"Speaking generally, I should say there could not be a less interesting occasion than the laying of the foundation-stone of a Club in London. For, after all, what are the Clubs of London? I am afraid little else than temples of luxury and ease. This, however, is a club of a very different character\", and envisioned the club as a popular institution for the mass electorate.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">G. W. E. Russell, ''Fifteen Chapters of Autobiography''(Thomas Nelson, London, undated), Chapter XXII.</ref> However, another of the club's founders, [[George W. E. Russell|G. W. E. Russell]], noted \"We certainly never foresaw the palatial pile of terra-cotta and glazed tiles which now bears that name. Our modest object was to provide a central meeting-place for Metropolitan and provincial Liberals, where all the comforts of life should be attainable at what are called 'popular prices'\", but added \"at the least, we meant our Club to be a place of \"ease\" to the Radical toiler. But Gladstone insisted that it was to be a workshop dedicated to strenuous labour.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> Funds for the clubhouse were raised by selling 40,000 shares of \u00a35 each, in a Limited Liability Company, with the unusual stipulation that \"No shareholder should have more than ''ten'' votes\", so as to prevent a few wealthy men from dominating the club.<ref name=\"autogenerated1925\"/> However, this only raised \u00a370,000,<ref name=\"autogenerated2012\"/> and so an additional \u00a352,400 was raised for the construction of the clubhouse by the Liberal Central Association.<ref>Roy Douglas, ''The History of the Liberal Party, 1895\u20131970'' (Sidgwick & Jackson, London, 1971), p. 17.</ref> The remaining \u00a330,000 necessary was raised by mortgage debentures.<ref name=\"autogenerated2012\"/>\n\nIn the five years between the club's establishment and completion of the building in 1887, it occupied temporary premises on the corner of [[Northumberland Avenue]] and Trafalgar Square. During this time, a [[parliamentary question]] was asked in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] about the [[White Ensign]] being raised on the club's flagpole as part of a prank.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1883/may/04/the-national-liberal-club |title=THE NATIONAL LIBERAL CLUB.

NLC members flocked to the windows to watch [[George Bernard Shaw]] (a member of the club) address the demonstration, and later in the day, witnessed the bloodshed which ensued.<ref>[http://www1.webng.com/timesofshaw/articles/1925.html 'Portrait of George Bernard Shaw'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625025358/http://www1.webng.com/timesofshaw/articles/1925.html |date=25 June 2011 }}, ''The Times'', 1 November 1925.</ref>\n\nIn its late-19th-century heyday, its membership was primarily political, but had a strong journalistic and even bohemian character. Members were known to finish an evening's dining by diving into the Thames.<ref name=\"autogenerated1925\"/> Of the club's political character, George Bernard Shaw remarked at a debate in the club, \"I have never yet met a member of the National Liberal Club who did not intend to get into Parliament at some time, except those who, like our chairman [[Charles Wynn-Carington, 1st Marquess of Lincolnshire|Lord Carrington]], are there already.\"<ref>George Bernard Shaw, 'The Case for Equality: speech at a National Liberal Club debate of 1913', in ed. James Fuchs, ''The Socialism of Shaw'' (New York, 1926), p. 58.</ref>\n\nOn the club's launch, it represented all factions of liberalism, but within four years it was rocked by the [[Government of Ireland Bill 1886|Home Rule Crisis of 1886]], which saw the [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionists]] led by [[Joseph Chamberlain]] and the [[Spencer Cavendish, 8th Duke of Devonshire|Marquess of Hartington]] (both of whom had been founder members of the NLC) secede from the party and eventually go into alliance with the Conservatives. Indeed, Chamberlain had been one of the NLC's most enthusiastic promoters upon its launch. At the 1884 ceremony of Gladstone's foundation-stone-laying for the club, Hartington had argued that the club would be the future home of Chamberlain's Radical [[Birmingham Caucus]], and Chamberlain pointedly refused to contradict him.<ref>Sir Alexander Mackintosh, ''Joseph Chamberlain: An Honest Biography'' (Hodder and Stoughton, London, 1914), p. 327.</ref> Chamberlain himself resigned in 1886, shortly after the Home Rule split, Hartington and other prominent Liberal Unionists followed early in 1887,<ref name=\"autogenerated1891\">Hamilton Fyfe and [[Joseph Irving]] (eds.), ''The Annals of Our Time ...: pt. 1. 20 June 1887 \u2013 December 1890'' (Macmillan, London, 1891).</ref> and when a further 130 Unionists simultaneously seceded from the club in 1889, the ''[[Scots Observer]]'' called it \"one of the most important events that has recently occurred in home politics\", due to its ramifications for the Liberal Party breaking in two.<ref>''The Scots Observer'', Vol. 1 (1889), p. 58.</ref>\n\nThe club enjoyed a reputation for radicalism, and H. V. Emy records that Radicals secured \n{{quote|a distinct success when the Radical wing of the National Liberal Club (NLC) captured the club's organisation in the summer of 1897 and elected a new political committee with [[Henry Labouch\u00e8re|[Henry] Labouchere]] as the chairman and [[Harold Reckitt|H. J. Reckitt]] as secretary. The Committee itself included [[Robert Reid, 1st Earl Loreburn|Sir Robert Reid]], [[Philip Stanhope, 1st Baron Weardale|[Philip] Stanhope]], [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Herbert Samuel]], [[Rufus Isaacs, 1st Marquess of Reading|Rufus Isaacs]] and W. F. Thompson, the editor of ''[[Reynold's News]]''. The Committee wrote an open letter to the constituencies, asking them for their opinions on policy, designating several areas where opinion would be welcome. By November, the replies indicated that the weight of opinion lay with the democratisation of Parliament, involving the abolition of the Lords' veto, reform of registration and electoral law, and devolution. Amongst \"other prominent reforms\" were included all the major issues of the day (except nationalisation).

On [[Armistice Day]] 1924, over one hundred defeated Liberal candidates met at the club to express their anger at Lloyd George's failure to use his infamous \"[[Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925|Lloyd George fund]]\" to help the Liberals in [[1924 United Kingdom general election|the disastrous general election campaign one month earlier]].<ref>[[Frank Owen (politician)|Frank Owen]], ''Tempestuous Journey: Lloyd George, His Life and Times'' (Hutchinson, London, 1954), p. 684.</ref> After the [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929 general election]], the first meeting of the newly expanded Parliamentary Liberal Party was held at the club, with all MPs except one (the independently minded [[Rhys Hopkin Morris]]) re-electing Lloyd George as Liberal Party Leader.<ref>J. Graham Jones, ''David Lloyd George and Welsh Liberalism'' (National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth, 2010), p. 271.</ref>\n\nIn 1932, the club first introduced non-political membership (now called Ordinary Membership). [[Michael Meadowcroft]] explains that this was done to provide, \"membership for Liberals who, by reason of their employment, such as judges, military officers or senior civil servants, were not permitted to divulge their politics\", and so who had been previously debarred by the club's insistence on all members signing a declaration of Liberal politics.<ref name=\"autogenerated2012\"/> This continues to this day, with Ordinary Members signing a pledge that they will \"not use the club or...membership thereof for political activities adverse to Liberalism\", and not having full voting rights at Annual General Meetings, but otherwise enjoying the full benefits of club membership.<ref>National Liberal Club application form, 2011.</ref>\n\n===World War II===\nOn 11 May 1941 the club suffered a direct hit by a [[Luftwaffe]] bomb during [[the Blitz]], which utterly destroyed the central staircase and caused considerable damage elsewhere. The \u00a3150,000 cost of reconstructing the staircase in 1950 placed a considerable strain on the club's finances, although generous support from the [[War Damage Commission]] helped to fund the new staircase.<ref>Short cinema documentary, ''[[Look at Life (British cinema series)|Look at Life: Members Only]]'' (1965).</ref> In the nine-year interim between the bomb blast and the rebuilding of the staircase, members had to use the stairs of the club's turret tower, often taking highly circuitous routes around the vast clubhouse.\n\nOne of the items damaged in the blast was the 1915 portrait of [[Winston Churchill]] (a member of the club), by [[Ernest Townsend]]. Ironically, after 25 years of being hidden from sight, it had only just been put on display the year before. Painted in the year of the [[Dardanelles Campaign]], Churchill was soon unavailable for unveiling the portrait as he went into exile in the trenches. After his return, his strong support for the [[United Kingdom coalition government (1916\u20131922)|Lloyd George coalition]] meant that from 1916 he proved to be ''persona non-grata'' at the club, and this only increased after he left the Liberal Party in 1924. Thus from 1915 to 1940, the painting was held by the club in storage. When Churchill became Prime Minister in May 1940, the club rushed out the painting and put it on display in the main lobby (where it still hangs today). It was bombed after one year, suffering a diagonal gash down the middle. The painting was then painstakingly restored, and Churchill re-unveiled it himself on 22 July 1943, at a ceremony also attended by [[Clementine Churchill, Baroness Spencer-Churchill|his wife]] (a lifelong Liberal), Liberal Leader [[Sir Archibald Sinclair]] (a friend and colleague of over 30 years, then serving in Churchill's cabinet), lifelong friend [[Violet Bonham Carter|Lady Violet Bonham Carter]], Club chairman [[James Meston, 1st Baron Meston|Lord Meston]] and cartoonist [[David Low (cartoonist)|David Low]].<ref name=\"autogenerated133\"/>\n\n===Post-war era===\nThe fortunes of the NLC have mirrored those of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] \u2013 as the Liberals declined as a national force in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, so did the NLC. However, despite the Liberals' national decline, the NLC remained a focus for debate.\n\nIn the early 1950s, it was a centre of anti-ID card sentiment, and [[Harry Willcock]], a member who successfully campaigned for the abolition of ID cards, tore his up in front of the club as a publicity stunt in 1951. He also died in the club during a debate held there{{dub|ODNB has \"at a meeting of the Eighty Club at the Reform Club\"|date=June 2018}} on 12 December 1952, with his last word being \"Freedom.\"<ref>Plaque in the NLC smoking room.</ref>\n\nIt was at a debate at the club in 1971 that [[Yale]] professor [[James Tobin]] first publicly voiced his proposal for a ''[[Tobin tax]]'' on financial transactions.<ref>Shirreff, David.

Thorpe later credited this system with giving him more time to think of answers to questions, and it helped to keep the Liberal campaign both distinctive and modern.<ref>[[Jeremy Thorpe]], ''In My Own Time: Reminiscences of a Liberal Leader'' (Politico's, London, 1999), p. 107.</ref> Further Liberal election campaigns of the 1970s and 1980s would retain the idea of a daily press conference at the NLC, but with live participants rather than a TV link-up to the party leader.<ref>Ivor Crewe and Anthony King, ''SDP: The Birth, Life and Death of the Social Democratic Party'' (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1995), p. 200.</ref>\n\n[[File:The National Liberal Club interior (4843463497).jpg|thumb|left|The interior]]\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, all London clubs were in serious decline,<ref name=\"autogenerated1979\"/> and the NLC was no exception. By the 1970s the club was in a serious state of disrepair, its membership dwindling, and its finances losing almost a thousand pounds a week. In 1976 Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe handed over the club to Canadian businessman George Marks, styling himself [[George de Chabris]] (and, more improbably,  \"His Serene Holiness the Prince de Chabris\", which he claimed was \"a Catholic title\"), who, unknown to Thorpe, was a [[confidence trick]]ster. \"De Chabris\" claimed to be a multi-millionaire willing to funnel money into the club (although both his wealth and his willingness to finance the club turned out to be untrue), and he spent nine months running the club, relaxing membership rules and bringing in more income, but also moving his family in rent-free, running several fraudulent businesses from its premises, paying for a sports car and his children's private school fees from the club's accounts, and he eventually left in a hurry owing the club \u00a360,000, even emptying out the cash till of the day's takings as he went. He eventually agreed to pay back half of that sum in instalments. In his time at the club he also sold it a painting for \u00a310,000, when it was valued at less than \u00a31,000.<ref>Lewis Chester, [[Magnus Linklater]] and David May, ''Jeremy Thorpe: A Secret Life'' (Fontana, 1979), pp. 190\u2013194, for a detailed description of de Chabris' involvement in the club in the 1970s.

The pretext given was that the club could no longer afford to pay the Librarian's wages, and that it did not want to leave such valuable material unguarded.<ref>The Times, Wednesday, 10 November 1976; pg. 1; Issue 59857; col G; The Times, Friday, 19 November 1976; pg. 4; Issue 59865; col G.</ref> [[Ian Bradley]] described it as \"a derisory sum\" for the sale, particularly in light of the unique collection of accumulated candidates' manifestos from 19th-century general elections.<ref>The Times, Thursday, 21 October 1982; pg. 8; Issue 61368; col B.</ref> Until its sale, it had been, as Peter Harris observed, \"The most extensive of the Club libraries of London.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\"/> The collection is still housed at Bristol today. However, the papers referring to the history of the club itself were returned to the NLC in the 1990s, as they had not been included in the sale, and had been sent to Bristol by accident.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nAfter the 1977 dismissal of de Chabris, a 1978 rescue package by [[Lawrence Robson|Sir Lawrence Robson]] (a former Liberal Party President and parliamentary candidate, co-founder and partner of [[Robson Rhodes]], and husband of Liberal peer [[Inga-Stina Robson|Baroness Robson]]) did much to stabilise the club and secure its future \u2013 to this day the club honours Sir Lawrence with a portrait in the Smoking Room, and one of its function rooms has been renamed the Lawrence Robson Room.\n\nAs the Liberal Party's lease on its headquarters expired in 1977, the party organisation moved to the upper floors of the NLC, the negotiations being arranged by \"de Chabris\". The Liberals occupied a suite of rooms on the second floor, and a series of offices converted from bedrooms on the upper floors. The party continued to operate from the NLC until 1988, when it merged with the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] to form the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], and moved to occupy the SDP's old headquarters in Cowley Street. During this time, party workers were known to avail themselves of the club downstairs, and the NLC bar became known as the \"Liberal Party's 'local'\" and a Liberal Party song \"Down at the Old NLC\" was written in response to this:\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nCome, come, roll up your trouser leg\nDown at the old NLC.\nCome, come, stuff your coat on the peg,\nDown at the old NLC.\nThere to get your apron on:\nLearn the secret organ song;\nBend your thumb when you shake hands.\nCome, come, drinking till the dinner gong,\nDown at the old NLC.</poem>|1985.

K. Chesterton]], [[Jerome K. Jerome]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Bram Stoker]], [[Dylan Thomas]], [[H. G. Wells]] and [[Leonard Woolf]]; several of whom featured the club in some of their works of literature.\n\nAdditionally, the [[Authors' Club]], founded in 1891 in neighbouring [[Whitehall Court]], lodged with the National Liberal Club between 1966 and 1976, and has done so again since 2014.\n\n*[[G. K. Chesterton]], who was a member, mentions it as a setting in the short story \"The Notable Conduct of Professor Chadd\" in his collection ''[[The Club of Queer Trades]]'' (1905), with the narrator having a one-hour conversation on politics and God with a judge he meets on the club's balcony.<ref>[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1696/1696-h/1696-h.htm G.

Wells also gave a lengthy description of the NLC in his novel ''[[The New Machiavelli]]'' (1911), discussing the narrator's experience of visiting the club during the 1906 general election:\n\n[[File:H. G. Wells, c.1890.jpg|thumb|NLC member [[H. G. Wells]] painted a vivid, detailed portrait of the club at the time of the [[1906 United Kingdom general election|Liberal landslide of 1906]].]]\n{{cquote|I engaged myself to speak at one or two London meetings, and lunched at the [[Reform Club|Reform]], which was fairly tepid, and dined and spent one or two tumultuous evenings at the National Liberal Club, which was in active eruption. The National Liberal became feverishly congested towards midnight as the results of the counting came dropping in. A big green-baize screen had been fixed up at one end of the large smoking-room with the names of the constituencies that were voting that day, and directly the figures came to hand, up they went, amidst cheers that at last lost their energy through sheer repetition, whenever there was record of a Liberal gain. I don't remember what happened when there was a Liberal loss; I don't think that any were announced while I was there.\n\nHow packed and noisy the place was, and what a reek of tobacco and [[whisky]] [[vapor|fumes]] we made! Everybody was excited and talking, making waves of harsh confused sound that beat upon one's ears, and every now and then hoarse voices would shout for someone to speak. Our little set was much in evidence. Both the Cramptons were in, Lewis, Bunting Harblow. We gave brief addresses attuned to this excitement and the late hour, amidst much enthusiasm.\n\n\"Now we can DO things!\" I said amidst a rapture of applause. Men I did not know from Adam held up glasses and nodded to me in solemn fuddled approval as I came down past them into the crowd again.\n\nMen were betting whether the Unionists would lose more or less than two hundred seats.\n\n\"I wonder just what we shall do with it all\", I heard one sceptic speculating....}}\n:Wells later described the State Opening of the new 1906 parliament:\n\n{{cquote|It is one of my vivid memories from this period, the sudden outbreak of [[top hat|silk hats]] in the [[smoking room|smoking-room]] of the National Liberal Club. At first I thought there must have been a funeral. Familiar faces that one had grown to know under [[trilby|soft felt hats]], under [[bowler hat|bowlers]], under [[fedora (hat)|liberal-minded wide brims]], and above artistic [[necktie|ties]] and [[tweed jacket]]s, suddenly met one, staring with the stern gaze of self-consciousness, from under silk hats of incredible glossiness. There was a disposition to wear the hat much too forward, I thought, for a good Parliamentary style.}}\n:About the club more broadly, Wells' narrator reflected:\n\n{{cquote|My discontents with the Liberal party and my mental exploration of the quality of party generally is curiously mixed up with certain impressions of things and people in the National Liberal Club. The National Liberal Club is Liberalism made visible in the flesh\u2014and [[salt glaze pottery|Doultonware]]. It is an extraordinary big club done in a bold, wholesale, shiny, marbled style, richly furnished with numerous paintings, steel engravings, busts, and full-length statues of the late Mr. Gladstone; and its spacious dining-rooms, its long, hazy, crowded smoking-room with innumerable little tables and groups of men in armchairs, its magazine room and library upstairs, have just that undistinguished and unconcentrated diversity which is for me the Liberal note. The pensive member sits and hears perplexing dialects and even fragments of foreign speech, and among the clustering masses of less insistent whites his roving eye catches profiles and complexions that send his mind afield to [[Calcutta]] or [[Rangoon]] or the [[West Indies]] or [[Sierra Leone]] or [[Cape of Good Hope|the Cape]]....\n\nI was not infrequently that pensive member. I used to go to the Club to doubt about Liberalism. About two o'clock in the day the great smoking-room is crowded with countless little groups. They sit about small round tables, or in circles of chairs, and the haze of tobacco seems to prolong the great narrow place, with its pillars and bays, to infinity. Some of the groups are big, as many as a dozen men talk in loud tones; some are [[duologue]]s, and there is always a sprinkling of lonely, dissociated men. At first one gets an impression of men going from group to group and as it were linking them, but as one watches closely one finds that these men just visit three or four groups at the outside, and know nothing of the others. One begins to perceive more and more distinctly that one is dealing with a sort of human [[mosaic]]; that each patch in that great place is of a different quality and colour from the next and never to be mixed with it. Most clubs have a common link, a lowest common denominator in the Club Bore, who spares no one, but even the National Liberal bores are specialised and sectional. As one looks round one sees here a clump of men from the [[North of England|North Country]] or the [[Staffordshire Potteries|Potteries]], here an island of [[South London]] politicians, here a couple of young [[Jews]] ascendant from [[Whitechapel]], here a circle of journalists and writers, here a group of Irish politicians, here two [[East India]]ns, here a priest or so, here a clump of old-fashioned Protestants, here a little knot of eminent [[rationalism|Rationalists]] indulging in a [[blasphemous]] story '''sotto voce'''. Next to them are a group of [[anglicise]]d [[Germans]] and highly specialised [[chess (game)|chess-players]], and then two of the oddest-looking persons\u2014bulging with documents and intent upon extraordinary business transactions over long cigars ...\n\nI would listen to a stormy sea of babblement, and try to extract some constructive intimations. Every now and then I got a whiff of politics. It was clear they were against [[House of Lords|the Lords]]\u2014against [[plutocrats]]\u2014against [[press baron|Cossington's]] newspapers\u2014against the [[brewery|brewers]].... It was tremendously clear what they were against. The trouble was to find out what on earth they were for!...\n\nAs I sat and thought, the streaked and mottled pillars and wall, the various views, aspects, and portraits of [[William Ewart Gladstone|Mr. and]] [[Catherine Gladstone|Mrs. Gladstone]], the partitions of polished [[mahogany]], the yellow-[[waistcoat|vested]] waiters, would dissolve and vanish, and I would have a vision of this sample of miscellaneous men of limited, diverse interests and a universal littleness of imagination enlarged, unlimited, no longer a sample but a community, spreading, stretching out to infinity\u2014all in little groups and duologues and circles, all with their special and narrow concerns, all with their backs to most of the others.\n\nWhat but a common antagonism would ever keep these multitudes together? I understood why modern [[electioneering]] is more than half of it [[denunciation]]. Let us condemn, if possible, let us obstruct and deprive, but not let us do. There is no real appeal to the commonplace mind in \"Let us do.\" That calls for the creative imagination, and few have been accustomed to respond to that call. The other merely needs jealousy and bate, of which there are great and easily accessible reservoirs in every human heart.<ref>H. G.

The night porter will hunt out a pair of pyjamas and escort you up the lift. Oh, he's used to it. He gets politicians from [[Bradford]] and such places dropping in at all hours.

Members are in one of two categories: either Members, who sign a declaration that they shall not use the club's facilities or their membership for 'political activities adverse to Liberalism', or Political Members, who sign the same declaration, plus an additional declaration that they are a Liberal in their politics, in exchange for additional voting rights within the club. Non-political Membership was first introduced in 1932, to allow Liberals to join when they had been barred up until that point, as several occupations such as judges, army officers and senior civil servants specifically forbade political declarations.<ref>Michael Meadowcroft, \"Celebrating 130 Years of High Victorian Style and Elegance\", ''NLC News'', Issue 63, pp. 13\u201314.</ref>\n\nIt is one of the few London clubs to contain another club within\u2014since 1990, the NLC has also been home to the [[Savage Club]], which lodges in some rooms on the ground floor.\n\nIn return for a collective subscription, members of the [[Mill Hill School|Old Millhillian's Club]] (OMC) have also been allowed to use the NLC clubhouse since 1968, when their own neighbouring [[Whitehall Court]] clubhouse closed down.\n\n===Ethnic minority members since the 1880s===\nIn keeping with its liberal roots, it was one of the first gentlemen's club to allow ethnic minorities as members (a handful of other clubs did so as well, including the [[East India Club]] whose members included Sir [[Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy]]). The first recorded ethnic minority member of the NLC, [[Dadabhai Naoroji]] was admitted in 1885, when the club was less than three years old, and spurred on by Club Secretary [[William Digby (writer)|William Digby]], by the late 1880s, the club had a large overseas membership, particularly concentrated in India and among Indian nationals resident in London.<ref>Mira Matikkala, \u2018Anti-Imperialism, Englishness, andEmpire in late-Victorian Britain\u2019 (Cambridge, PhD, 2006).</ref> Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the first Governor General of Pakistan, and a successful barrister, was a member of the National Liberal Club.\n\n[[File:Alan Beith MP Liverpool.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Long-standing Liberal and Lib Dem MP [[Alan Beith|Sir Alan Beith]] has been the club's President since 2008.]]\n\n===Women members since the 1960s===\nSince the club's 1882 foundation, women had always been allowed to use the club as visitors, but remained barred from membership until the 1960s, when it became one of the first \"gentlemen's clubs\" to admit women members.

The club's first full women members in 1976 were Christina Baron and Joyce Arram.\n\n===Dress code===\nWhen the club was originally launched in 1882, like every other London club of the era it had no prescriptive dress code. In 1888, a simple requirement was introduced that \"No member shall appear in any public rooms of the Club in a dressing gown, slippers, or other ''[[wikt:deshabille]]''.\" Beyond that, the club's only dress code was a request in the Regulations that members \"dress and conduct themselves in a manner consistent with civilised standards\", but precisely how members chose to observe that remained a matter of considerable personal interpretation.<ref name=\"meadowcroftdresscode2017\">Michael Meadowcroft, \"Breaking the Code\", ''NLC News'', Issue 72, April 2017, pp. 22-23.</ref> Indeed, the club's first official history, in 1925, noted that an unusual feature of the NLC was the way in which it enjoyed far more casual dress than other London clubs, with members turning up in their working clothes, and it singled out, \"the practical tabooing of evening dress, which assisted in securing the attendance of the House of Commons and Press Gallery men for at least part of the social evening.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1925\"/>  This absence of any prescriptive dress code remained the club's ''modus operandi'' from 1882 until 1979, when the Club's flurry of recent scandals led the General Committee to impose a strict jacket-and-tie dress code for men, emulating the jacket-and-tie dress codes introduced in other London clubs in the 1950s, which the NLC had previously held out against. No vote of the membership was held on the new dress code.<ref name=\"meadowcroftdresscode2017\"/>\n\nThis strict jacket-and-tie dress code remained in place for 40 years after the General Committee's 1979 decision, although a 2005 review led the club to permit men to remove their jackets on the club's terrace.<ref name=\"meadowcroftdresscode2017\"/>\n\nIn May 2018, the Club's Annual General Meeting voted by 49 to 36 in favour of a trial relaxation of the dress code in July and August of that year, removing the jacket-and-tie requirement from every part of the club except the Dining Room.<ref name=\"berridge2018\">Janet Berridge, \"National Liberal Club to trial relaxation of the dress code\", ''Lib Dem Voice'', 19 May 2018, https://www.libdemvoice.org/national-liberal-club-to-trial-relaxation-of-dress-code-57555.html</ref> It was the first time in 39 years that members had been permitted a formal vote on the dress code.
