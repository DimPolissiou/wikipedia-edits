{"title_page": "Species description", "text_new": "{{short description|Formal description and naming of a new recognised species}}\n{{Redirect|New species|newly evolved species|speciation}}\nA '''species description''' is a formal description of a newly discovered [[species]], usually in the form of a [[scientific paper]].  Its purpose is to give a clear description of a new species of [[organism]] and explain how it differs from species which have been described previously or are related. The species description often contains photographs or other illustrations of the [[tyhgchjhpe (biology)|type material]] and states in which museums it has been deposited. The publication in which the species is described gives the new species a formal [[scientific name]].

These criteria are intended to ensure that the species name is clear and unambiguous, for example, the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] (ICZN) states that \"Authors should exercise reasonable care and consideration in forming new names to ensure that they are chosen with their subsequent users in mind and that, as far as possible, they are appropriate, compact, euphonious, memorable, and do not cause offence.\"<ref name=\"ICZNRec25C\">{{cite web|accessdate=June 18, 2011|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/|title=International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, Recommendation 25C}}</ref>\n\nSpecies names are written in the 26 letters of the Latin alphabet, but many species names are based on words from other languages, Latinized.\n\nOnce the manuscript has been accepted for publication,<ref name=\"ICZNexampleabstract\">One example of an abstract of an article naming a new species can be found at {{cite journal|last1=Wellner|first1=S.|last2=Lodders|first2=N.|last3=Kampfer|first3=P.|title=Methylobacterium cerastii sp. nov., isolated from the leaf surface of Cerastium holosteoides|journal=International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology|date=13 June 2011|volume=62|issue=Pt 4|pages=917\u2013924|doi=10.1099/ijs.0.030767-0|url=http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/content/early/2011/06/10/ijs.0.030767-0.abstract?sid=90908f15-6b51-4878-8663-92387c779b71|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130415195732/http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/content/early/2011/06/10/ijs.0.030767-0.abstract?sid=90908f15-6b51-4878-8663-92387c779b71|url-status=dead|archive-date=15 April 2013|accessdate=June 18, 2011|pmid=21669927|doi-access=free}}</ref> the new species name is officially created.\n\nOnce a species name has been assigned and approved, it can generally not be changed except in the case of error.

These catalogs typically featured extensive descriptions of each species and were often illustrated upon reprinting.\n\nThe first of these large catalogs was [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[History of Animals]]'', published around 343 B.C. Aristotle included descriptions of creatures, mostly fish and invertebrates, in his homeland, and several [[mythological creature]]s rumored to live in far-away lands, such as the [[manticore]].\n\nIn 77 A.D. [[Pliny the Elder]] dedicated several volumes of his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' to the description of all life forms he knew to exist.  He appears to have read Aristotle's work, since he writes about many of the same far-away mythological creatures.\n\nToward the end of the 12th century, ''[[Konungs skuggsj\u00e1]]'', an [[Old Norse]] [[philosophical]] [[didactic]] work, featured several descriptions of the whales, seals, and monsters of the Icelandic seas. These descriptions were brief and often erroneous, and a description of the [[mermaid]] and a rare island-like sea monster called [[Hafgufa|Hafgufu]] was included.

Publishing a paper documenting a single species was much faster and could be done by scientists with less broadened scopes of study.

[[MacEwan University]] in Edmonton, Alberta, and the MacEwan Student Centre at the [[University of Calgary]] as well as the neighbourhoods of [[MacEwan Glen]] in Calgary and [[MacEwan, Edmonton|MacEwan]] in Edmonton are named after him.\n\n==Roots==\nMacEwan's grandparents were [[Highland Scottish]]. George MacEwen (Grant MacEwan changed his name to \"MacEwan\"with an \"a\" sometime in the 1920s), his paternal grandfather, came from [[Stirling, Scotland|Stirling]], Scotland to farm in [[Guelph]], Ontario, and married Annie Cowan, another Scot. These two had a son, Alexander MacEwen. After leaving home, Alexander went to [[Brandon, Manitoba]] to begin a farm of his own, and was introduced to Bertha Grant (his neighbour James Grant's sister) and soon got married. Bertha and Alexander were MacEwan's parents. Bertha was a devout [[Presbyterian]]. This strong Scottish, Presbyterian, and agriculture-driven heritage was influential in MacEwan's life.\n\n==Early life (1902\u20131921)==\nMacEwan was born in Brandon, Manitoba, and lived there until the age of thirteen. Because of problems with his father's fire-extinguisher business, the family moved to [[Melfort, Saskatchewan]], to begin a life of farming. As a boy, MacEwan was entrepreneurial, entering into many different businesses, especially cattle. Most of his first big investments were in cows, either for entering into shows or for producing calves and milk. MacEwan also delivered newspapers and sold vegetables and various other items. At the age of twelve, he began working at a grocery store.  He went to school and spent most of his time helping out on the family farm.\n\n==Student years (1921\u20131928)==\nIn 1921, at the age of nineteen, MacEwan went to Guelph, Ontario to attend the [[Ontario Agricultural College]] (then, an associate agricultural college of the [[University of Toronto]]). He attended the OAC for five years before going back to Melfort. MacEwan was often placed among the top of his class. He lived in College, and took part in a multitude of campus activities, including the football and basketball teams. In his first two years he completed a preliminary agricultural education. This then allowed him to attend the school for another three years to get a full degree.\n\nDuring his time at school his brother George fell ill with spinal meningitis and died on March 27, 1924. This event was hard on both MacEwan and his parents. His family was very tightly knit, and George had been very close to his parents.\n\nOn May 28, 1926, MacEwan graduated from the OAC along with 33 other boys with a BSc degree. After receiving the degree he returned home.\n\nIn 1927, he received an invitation to study at the [[University of Iowa]]. He once again left home to complete a one-year program. In 1928, he received an MSc degree from the University.\n\n==Academic years (1928\u20131951)==\nMacEwan held a position first as a professor, then Head of [[Animal Husbandry]] at the [[University of Saskatchewan]] from 1928 to 1946. It was here that he developed as an [[agriculturalist]]. He researched and published manuscripts on many farming and ranching techniques. During this period, MacEwan traveled away from the University to many farms across [[Saskatchewan]] to lecture, judge animals and give meat-cutting lessons.\n\nIn 1932, MacEwan took a trip to Great Britain with a load of cattle, to observe ranching practices in the British Isles. He visited Scotland and recorded in his journal that, \"it is but little wonder that such a unique country has produced the best horses, the best cattle, and the best men in the world.\" (see Foran, Max reference) He also visited [[Wales]], England and [[Jersey]]. He returned to Canada via the [[Hudson Bay]] ship route north along the coasts of [[Iceland]] and [[Greenland]], then entering Hudson Bay and landing at [[Churchill, Manitoba]]. He was the first person to go through customs at the new port in Churchill.\n\nMacEwan married Phyllis Cline, a school teacher from Saskatchewan, in 1935. Two stories from his wedding cast light on what kind of a person MacEwan was. First, whereas traditionally the bride and groom remain out of public view until the ceremony calls for them to enter, Grant stood at the front entrance to greet guests as they arrived. Second, when it came time for the new couple to leave, MacEwan could not be found until someone looked out at the parking lot, where Grant was fixing a flat tire. Grant and Phyllis had a daughter, Heather MacEwan, in 1939.\n\nIn 1946 MacEwan moved to the [[University of Manitoba]] to be the [[dean (education)|Dean]] of Agriculture. He served in this position until 1951. In 1948, he published his first historical book, ''The Sodbusters''. It was the first of thirty-seven historical documents he wrote. His style was characterized by plain speech, to convey ideas easily to the reader \u2013 specifically students.\n\n==Politician years (1951\u20131965)==\nMacEwan spent his entire career affiliated with the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]]. On June 25, 1951 he took his first run at electoral politics by running for a seat in the [[House of Commons of Canada]] in the electoral district of [[Brandon (electoral district)|Brandon]]. He was defeated by Progressive Conservative [[Walter Dinsdale]] by a wide margin finishing second in the two candidate race.<ref name=\"1951by\">{{cite web|title=Brandon election results|date=June 25, 1951|publisher=Parliament of Canada|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/HFER/hfer.asp?Language=E&Search=Cresdetail&Election=6843|accessdate=February 5, 2010}}</ref> The riding voted for Dinsdale despite being a Liberal stronghold. MacEwan had been parachuted in the district while he was still living in [[Winnipeg]], Manitoba. Dinsdale on the other hand was local to Brandon and came from a prominent family in the district thus appealing to the voters more than MacEwan.<ref name=\"parachute\">{{cite news|title=Why the Liberals Lost|work=The Ottawa Evening Citizen|date=July 5, 1951|page=32|first=James H. |last=Gray}}</ref>\n\nHe won a seat in the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]] in 1955, and from November 1958 MacEwan led the [[Alberta Liberal Party]] through a [[1959 Alberta general election|provincial election]]. His party won only one seat in the [[1959 Alberta general election|1959 election]] with MacEwan suffering personal defeat in his Calgary riding. He remained the leader of the party until 1960. During the election, his reputation was his main asset in the campaign against the [[Alberta Social Credit Party|Social Credit Party]], but the strong anti-Liberal sentiment in Alberta ultimately defeated the Liberals.\n\nDuring the 1950s, MacEwan became a vegetarian out of respect for the lives of animals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://econet.ca/sk_enviro_champions/macewan.html |title=J.W.

His books, mostly biographical, were based on history but often left out references, a bibliography ,or even analysis of historical events. That made critics continually attack.his unprofessional approach to history. The only response that he gave was that in.1984, \"I don't know what the scholars will think of it. Nor do I care. I'm not writing for them, I'm writing for Canadians\" (Lee Shedden reference). He also taught numerous courses at the [[University of Calgary]] and [[Olds College]]. He became an Officer of the [[Order of Canada]] in 1974.\n\nMacEwan continued to be physically active and was not known to waste any time. He believed that anyone awake should be doing something. In his eighties, he still rode horses, hiked and walked, outpaced reporters on morning jogs, built a log cabin, and chopped logs with an axe.\n\nIn 1990, his wife died, and afterwards, he began to slow down but remained very active in comparison to other 90-year-olds. He continued to give speeches, and published two more books in the 1990s. Another book was released two months after his death. On May 6, 2000, MacEwan received [[Golden Pen Lifetime Achievement Award]] for lifetime literary achievements by the [[Writers Guild of Alberta|Writers' Guild of Alberta]] that has been given to only one other person, [[W.O. Mitchell]]. He died a month later in [[Calgary]], aged 97, and was given a [[state funeral]], the first one in Alberta since 1963 (for [[Peter Dawson (politician)|Peter Dawson]]), at Robertson-Wesley United Church in Edmonton.\n\n==Legacy==\nMacEwan is often seen as an iconic historic figurehead in Alberta, and many places, institutions, and organizations have been named after him.\n\n==='Grant MacEwan' used as place or building name===\n*Elementary School in Calgary\n*MacEwan Student Centre at University of Calgary\n*[[MacEwan University]] in Edmonton\n*[[Grant MacEwan Literary Awards]]\n*Grant MacEwan Peak in Bow Valley Wildland Provincial Park\n*Grant MacEwan Boulevard in Leduc\n*Grant MacEwan Bridge in Fort McMurray\n*Community of \"MacEwan\" in Calgary\n*Neighbourhood of \"MacEwan\" in Edmonton\n\n==='Grant MacEwan' used as organization name===\n* [[Grant MacEwan College]]\n* [http://www.gmmc.ca Grant MacEwan Mountain Club]\n\n==Published works==\n* ''The Science and Practice of Canadian Animal Husbandry'' (with A.

[[MacEwan University]] in Edmonton, Alberta and the MacEwan Student Centre at the [[University of Calgary]] as well as the neighbourhoods of [[MacEwan Glen]] in Calgary and [[MacEwan, Edmonton|MacEwan]] in Edmonton are named after him.\n\n==Roots==\nMacEwan's grandparents were [[Highland Scottish]]. George MacEwen (Grant MacEwan changed his name to \"MacEwan\"with an \"a\" sometime in the 1920s), his paternal grandfather, came from [[Stirling, Scotland|Stirling]], Scotland to farm in [[Guelph]], Ontario, and married Annie Cowan, another Scot. These two had a son, Alexander MacEwen. After leaving home, Alexander went to [[Brandon, Manitoba]] to begin a farm of his own, and was introduced to Bertha Grant (his neighbour James Grant's sister) and soon got married. Bertha and Alexander were MacEwan's parents. Bertha was a devout [[Presbyterian]]. This strong Scottish, Presbyterian, and agriculture-driven heritage was influential in MacEwan's life.\n\n==Early life (1902\u20131921)==\nMacEwan was born in Brandon, Manitoba, and lived there until the age of thirteen. Because of problems with his father's fire-extinguisher business, the family moved to [[Melfort, Saskatchewan]] to begin a life of farming. As a boy, MacEwan was entrepreneurial, entering into many different businesses, especially cattle. Most of his first big investments were in cows, either for entering into shows or for producing calves and milk. MacEwan also delivered newspapers and sold vegetables and various other items. At the age of twelve, he began working at a grocery store.  He went to school and spent most of his time helping out on the family farm.\n\n==Student years (1921\u20131928)==\nIn 1921, at the age of nineteen, MacEwan went to Guelph, Ontario to attend the [[Ontario Agricultural College]] (then, an associate agricultural college of the [[University of Toronto]]). He attended the OAC for five years before going back to Melfort. MacEwan was often placed among the top of his class. He lived in College, and took part in a multitude of campus activities, including the football and basketball teams. In his first two years he completed a preliminary agricultural education. This then allowed him to attend the school for another three years to get a full degree.\n\nDuring his time at school his brother George fell ill with spinal meningitis and died on March 27, 1924. This event was hard on both MacEwan and his parents. His family was very tightly knit, and George had been very close to his parents.\n\nOn May 28, 1926, MacEwan graduated from the OAC along with thirty-three other boys with a BSc degree. After receiving the degree he returned home.\n\nIn 1927, he received an invitation to study at the [[University of Iowa]]. He once again left home to complete a one-year program. In 1928, he received an MSc degree from the University.\n\n==Academic years (1928\u20131951)==\nMacEwan held a position first as a professor, then Head of [[Animal Husbandry]] at the [[University of Saskatchewan]] from 1928 to 1946. It was here that he developed as an [[agriculturalist]]. He researched and published manuscripts on many farming and ranching techniques. During this period, MacEwan traveled away from the University to many farms across [[Saskatchewan]] to lecture, judge animals and give meat-cutting lessons.\n\nIn 1932, MacEwan took a trip to Great Britain with a load of cattle, to observe ranching practices in the British Isles. He visited Scotland and recorded in his journal that, \"it is but little wonder that such a unique country has produced the best horses, the best cattle, and the best men in the world.\" (see Foran, Max reference) He also visited [[Wales]], England and [[Jersey]]. He returned to Canada via the [[Hudson Bay]] ship route north along the coasts of [[Iceland]] and [[Greenland]], then entering Hudson Bay and landing at [[Churchill, Manitoba]]. He was the first person to go through customs at the new port in Churchill.\n\nMacEwan married Phyllis Cline, a school teacher from Saskatchewan in 1935. Two stories from his wedding cast light on what kind of a person MacEwan was. Firstly, whereas traditionally the bride and groom remain out of public view until the ceremony calls for them to enter, Grant stood at the front entrance to greet guests as they arrived. Secondly, when it came time for the new couple to leave, MacEwan could not be found until someone looked out at the parking lot, where Grant was fixing a flat tire. Grant and Phyllis had a daughter, Heather MacEwan, in 1939.\n\nIn 1946 MacEwan moved to the [[University of Manitoba]] to be the [[dean (education)|Dean]] of Agriculture. He served in this position until 1951. In 1948, he published his first historical book, ''The Sodbusters''. It was the first of thirty-seven historical documents he wrote. His style was characterized by plain speech, to convey ideas easily to the reader \u2013 specifically students.\n\n==Politician years (1951\u20131965)==\nMacEwan spent his entire career affiliated with the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]]. On June 25, 1951 he took his first run at electoral politics by running for a seat in the [[House of Commons of Canada]] in the electoral district of [[Brandon (electoral district)|Brandon]]. He was defeated by Progressive Conservative [[Walter Dinsdale]] by a wide margin finishing second in the two candidate race.<ref name=\"1951by\">{{cite web|title=Brandon election results|date=June 25, 1951|publisher=Parliament of Canada|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/HFER/hfer.asp?Language=E&Search=Cresdetail&Election=6843|accessdate=February 5, 2010}}</ref> The riding voted for Dinsdale despite being a Liberal stronghold. MacEwan had been parachuted in the district while he was still living in [[Winnipeg]], Manitoba. Dinsdale on the other hand was local to Brandon and came from a prominent family in the district thus appealing to the voters more than MacEwan.<ref name=\"parachute\">{{cite news|title=Why the Liberals Lost|work=The Ottawa Evening Citizen|date=July 5, 1951|page=32|first=James H. |last=Gray}}</ref>\n\nHe won a seat in the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]] in 1955, and from November 1958 MacEwan led the [[Alberta Liberal Party]] through a [[1959 Alberta general election|provincial election]]. His party won only one seat in the [[1959 Alberta general election|1959 election]] with MacEwan suffering personal defeat in his Calgary riding. He remained the leader of the party until 1960. During the election, his reputation was his main asset in the campaign against the [[Alberta Social Credit Party|Social Credit Party]], but the strong anti-Liberal sentiment in Alberta ultimately defeated the Liberals.\n\nDuring the 1950s, MacEwan became a vegetarian out of respect for the lives of animals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://econet.ca/sk_enviro_champions/macewan.html |title=J.W.

His books, mostly biographical, were based on history but often left out references, a bibliography ,or even analysis of historical events. That made critics continually attack.his unprofessional approach to history. The only response that he gave was that in.1984, \"I don't know what the scholars will think of it. Nor do I care. I'm not writing for them, I'm writing for Canadians\" (Lee Shedden reference). He also taught numerous courses at the [[University of Calgary]] and [[Olds College]]. He became an Officer of the [[Order of Canada]] in 1974.\n\nMacEwan continued to be physically active and was not known to waste any time. He believed that anyone awake should be doing something. In his eighties, he still rode horses, hiked and walked, outpaced reporters on morning jogs, built a log cabin, and chopped logs with an axe.\n\nIn 1990, his wife died, and afterwards, he began to slow down but remained very active in comparison to other 90-year-olds. He continued to give speeches, and published two more books in the 1990s. Another book was released two months after his death. On May 6, 2000, MacEwan received [[Golden Pen Lifetime Achievement Award]] for lifetime literary achievements by the [[Writers Guild of Alberta|Writers' Guild of Alberta]] that has been given to only one other person, [[W.O. Mitchell]]. He died a month later in [[Calgary]], aged 97, and was given a [[state funeral]], the first one in Alberta since 1963 (for [[Peter Dawson (politician)|Peter Dawson]]), at Robertson-Wesley United Church in Edmonton.\n\n==Legacy==\nMacEwan is often seen as an iconic historic figurehead in Alberta, and many places, institutions, and organizations have been named after him.\n\n==='Grant MacEwan' used as place or building name===\n*Elementary School in Calgary\n*MacEwan Student Centre at University of Calgary\n*[[MacEwan University]] in Edmonton\n*[[Grant MacEwan Literary Awards]]\n*Grant MacEwan Peak in Bow Valley Wildland Provincial Park\n*Grant MacEwan Boulevard in Leduc\n*Grant MacEwan Bridge in Fort McMurray\n*Community of \"MacEwan\" in Calgary\n*Neighbourhood of \"MacEwan\" in Edmonton\n\n==='Grant MacEwan' used as organization name===\n* [[Grant MacEwan College]]\n* [http://www.gmmc.ca Grant MacEwan Mountain Club]\n\n==Published works==\n* ''The Science and Practice of Canadian Animal Husbandry'' (with A.
