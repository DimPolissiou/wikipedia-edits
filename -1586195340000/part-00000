When naming the girls, the first person to receive her name is \"Oyster,\" a name she dislikes. Flav gives all of the girls nicknames, but cannot think of one for a particular girl, who tells him she likes scuba diving, so he names her 'Shellz.' Oyster then reveals that she has worn red clothing every day for six years straight, and decides to name herself \"Red Oyster.\" Hottie is very aggressive with Flav, which he likes. New York makes a comment about all of the girls being \"a loud pack of idiot bitches,\" which sparked her reputation for being the villainess. Goldie drinks too much champagne, vomits, and passes out. Hottie is the first to receive a clock, and Rain manages to get Goldie standing in time for the elimination ceremony, and she is the last person to receive her clock. On her way out Cherry cries and wonders how \"Goldie, who puked in bucket, a gallon of puke\" stays. Smokey, Shellz, Picasso, and Bubblez are also eliminated.\n* '''Eliminated:''' Bubblez, Shellz, Smokey, Picasso, Cherry\n;Reasons for elimination\n* Flav felt he hadn't gotten to know any of the 5 girls\n\n===\"Rub a Dub Flav\"===\n''First aired January 7, 2006''\n\n:The fifteen remaining contestants engage in a competition where Flav has 10 minutes to spend with each woman in a private hot tub. In the van on the way to the resort, Rain and New York get into a heated argument over New York's unfriendliness toward the other contestants. At the resort, contestants prepare themselves and their hot tub with candles and drinks to keep Flav entertained. Some of the hot tub settings are nice, but some are strange, such as Hottie's. Flav states \"Hottie is very 'dramatical.' She tried to 'hypnotize' me!\" In the end, Flav picks Smiley, New York, and Miss Latin for a private roller skating date, where Smiley reveals she was previously married. (It was revealed in the reunion show that she was only divorced one week before the taping of the show.) Later at the house, Pumkin confronts New York about her unfriendliness towards some of the other contestants in the house, resulting in the two of them fighting and exchanging insults, but Red Oyster, Hottie, and Rain try to break up the ruckus. Red Oyster and Hottie protect New York, and Rain protects Pumkin, while Pumkin screams \"you bitch!\" at New York. Red Oyster passes along information to Flav that Miss Latin has been calling her ex-boyfriend, Kash, from the house, saying not to hang up. He hangs up on her. Miss Latin, Rain, Georgia, Apples, and Dimplez are eliminated. Apples' and Dimplez's names are never revealed on-screen.\n* '''Challenge:''' to keep flav entertained in a hot tub\n* '''Winners:''' Smiley, New York, Miss Latin\n* '''Eliminated:''' Georgia, Rain, Dimplez, Miss Latin, Apples\n;Reasons for elimination\n* Georgia: Flav still hadn't gotten to know her\n* Rain: Flav felt she had a bit of a temper\n* Dimplez: She didn't stand out\n* Apples: She didn't stand out\n* Miss Latin: Flav found out she was calling her ex from his house\n\n===\"A Friend of Flav's is a Friend of Mine\"===\n''First aired January 15, 2006''\n\n:Flav takes the women to visit some of his \"old friends\" as well as some \"new friends.\" The five contestants who are taken to meet Flav's \"old friends\" suspect that they will be meeting his celebrity friends (most notably the other members of [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]]) but are surprised when they arrive at a senior center where their challenge is to care for and socialize with the elderly. Some girls have fun with the challenge, while some, such as New York, are uncomfortable. Sweetie wins and surprises Flav with her refusal to kiss him, saying it would take about three more weeks.\n\n:The five contestants that go to meet Flav's \"new friends\" are taken to a park where they are challenged to organize and execute a birthday party for young children. Though Pumkin thought she would win, everyone was surprised when Serious did. New York walks out of the senior citizen center when a woman asks her for help with her false teeth, and Pumkin, a substitute teacher, cries after Flav says she was the most distant when playing with the children.\n\nNew York accuses Hottie of stealing her jacket because she had made statements that she was so competitive that she might cut up someone's clothes to win. Hottie rebuffs New York, saying New York is just jealous, because Hottie believes she looks like [[Beyonc\u00e9]]. New York tells her she looks more like [[Luther Vandross]]. New York's exact words from the unrated DVD to [[Beyonc\u00e9]] was \" Beyonce, sweetie, I'm so sorry that an ugly ass bitch like this would even say that, oh my god.\" Serious [[Indecent exposure|showed her breasts]] to Hottie and says that if Hottie's \"double D's\" don't look like hers, it shouldn't matter. New York and Pumkin then begin confronting Hottie. Hottie tells Pumkin, \"you need to learn how to read.\" Pumkin comes back at Hottie with, \"I can read you, fat fucking bitch that's all I need to read.\" New York tells Hottie if something in the house goes missing that she would always come to Hottie, because Hottie has a history of stealing, and due to a few comments Hottie made about being so competitive that she would \"cut clothes, steal things, etc.\"\n\nNeither New York nor Hottie is happy when Flav gives them both clocks. Serious does not receive a clock because Red Oyster informs Flav that she believes that she is only here to further her career in modeling. Peaches is also eliminated as well.\n* '''Challenge:''' to meet some \"old\" and \"new\" friends\n* '''Winners:''' Sweetie (old), Serious (new)\n* '''Eliminated:''' Serious, Peaches\n; Reasons for elimination\n* Serious: Red Oyster told Flav that Serious was only there to further her career in modeling.\n* Peaches: Flav said he wasn't feeling her.\n\n===\"The Flavor of Chicken\"===\n''First aired January 22, 2006''\n\n:The contestants try to impress Flav's mother (Anna Drayton) by accompanying her to church, introducing themselves over tea and pastries at a [[tea room]] and by attempting to cook [[fried chicken]]. Hottie ends up attempting to cook her chicken in the microwave, stuffed with raw vegetables, leaving it raw during the presentation to Flav and his mother. Hottie thought the button that said 'chicken' meant that it would cook an entire chicken. Goldie, says \"Bitch is crazy!\" Hoopz wins the cooking competition. Sweetie is disappointed because she hates chicken after an incident when she was five, and is angry that she cooked a chicken for nothing. Hoopz then has dinner with Flav and his mother, who warms up to Hoopz after being indifferent to her in the beginning. Sweetie is eliminated, as Flav doubts whether she really likes him. Sweetie throws a tantrum because she feels that she has shown him several times that she likes him (cooking a chicken, staying up late for a date, etc.) She felt that he left a lot of \"jokes\" in his house, referring to New York, Red Oyster and Hottie. She tells Flav off as she exits the house and calls Flav \"retarded\" in a New Jersey accent, and the other girls are shocked.\n* '''Challenge:''' to make fried chicken\n* '''Winner:''' Hoopz\n* '''Eliminated:''' Sweetie\n; Reason for elimination\n* Sweetie: Flav doubted that she had love for him\n\n===\"What Happens in Flavor Stays in Flavor\"===\n''First aired January 29, 2006''\n\n:Flav takes the seven remaining girls to [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] to test their luck, literally, at a [[roulette]] table. Each girl is given $100 in chips and 10 minutes at the wheel. Several of the girls blow their entire stake in one roll. New York won the most money for Flav by winning $465, and earned herself a one-on-one date with him that night. New York confesses her love for Flav, and Flav is troubled when New York admits that she would be upset if he were to kiss other women. Flav is turned off by New York's jealous ways.\n\n:While New York and Flav were on the date, Hoopz, Goldie, Hottie, Red Oyster, Pumkin, and Smiley went to a [[strip club]]. Hoopz is convinced Red Oyster and Hottie are going to tattle on them for going there. When they return from Vegas, Flav organizes a \"Five Senses\" challenge. Throughout the entire competition, Smiley and New York were the runaway leaders in terms of points accumulated. For the final part of the challenge, Smiley does a very erotic dance (which is not censored on the DVD). New York attempts an erotic dance and nearly falls through the privacy screen (so Flav could not tell who was who). Due to New York's gaffe, Smiley wins, and she spends time with Flav in his hot tub.\n\n:During the elimination ceremony at the end of the episode, Red Oyster announces that she is eliminating herself from the competition to be with her father, who she has just found out was in a serious car accident. Flav tells Red Oyster he is sorry to see her go because he would have saved her from elimination. New York and Hottie had not received clocks at that time, and were saved from elimination, even though one of them was scheduled to leave that night. New York was troubled because she desperately wanted to know if she would have received a clock or not. Red Oyster hugs her alliance \"New York\" on her way out. Hottie tells Red Oyster that the same thing happened to her, but Red Oyster insults her, Red Oyster also reveals to Hottie that it was Red Oyster herself that ripped the pages out of Hottie's diary, because she didn't like Hottie trying to start something between Red Oyster and her ally New York.\n* '''Challenge:''' Roulette\n* '''Winner:''' New York\n* '''Challenge:''' Five Senses\n* '''Winner:''' Smiley\n* '''Quit:''' Red Oyster\n; Reason for withdrawal\n* Red Oyster: Red Oyster had found out her father was in a very serious car crash, and wanted to be home to be there with him.\n\n===\"InterroGitted\"===\n''First aired February 12, 2006''\n\n:Flav's old flame, [[Brigitte Nielsen]], visits the house to administer [[lie detector]] tests to the six remaining contestants. While having his hair braided, Flav sees Hottie on an episode of ''[[Blind Date (US TV series)|Blind Date]]'', where she states that she is looking to date a man who will spend money on her. He calls Hoopz, Smiley, Pumkin and Goldie, who happened to be nearby, into his bedroom, and they are shocked at what they see. Later, Pumkin reveals to the girls that she has also been on ''Blind Date'', but doesn't tell Flav. The lie detector test shows that Hottie lied about her age and her body measurements. Goldie was the only one who was completely truthful on her test, though Smiley was honest in admitting she still loved her ex-husband and was previously a stripper. Hoopz spends the majority of the night arguing with [[Brigitte Nielsen]], and abruptly leaves a dinner Brigitte threw in their honor, but Hoopz manages to escape elimination. Smiley reveals her past as an exotic dancer, then argues with New York after admitting that she still has feelings for her ex-husband. New York passes this information on to Flav, but refuses to mention Smiley directly. Pumkin readily volunteers Smiley's name. When Flav meets with Brigitte, she tells Flav that ''none'' of the girls are right for him. Flav eliminates Hottie for not being truthful, & for coming across as a 'gold-digger' on \"Blind Date\". Flav had a clock for Smiley but chose not to give it to her for having issues with her ex-husband.\n* '''Challenge:''' Lie detector test\n* '''Winner:''' Goldie\n* '''Eliminated:''' Hottie, Smiley\n; Reasons for elimination\n* Hottie: Flav found footage of her on ''Blind Date'', in which she acted like a gold-digger, making Flav believe she was only after his money.\n* Smiley: Flav originally had a clock for her, but eliminated her so she could go home and work on her issues\n\n===\"Flav's Trippin'\"===\n''First aired February 19, 2006''\n\n:The four remaining ladies go on an overnight trip with Flav. First, Pumkin and Hoopz go with Flav to a spa in [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]], California where they do [[yoga]], mud [[body painting]], and then all enjoy a clean-up shower together. During dinner, Pumkin uses Hoopz's restroom break as her opportunity to give Flav a personal letter, which indicated that she wanted to be intimate with him that night. After reading it, he later informs Hoopz that he and Pumkin are heading back to his room to spend the night together. For the second trip, Flav takes Goldie and New York to San Diego, where they visit the [[San Diego Zoo|World Famous San Diego Zoo]] and Flav chooses to spend the night with Goldie, though she just wants to be his friend. At the end of the episode Goldie is eliminated, claiming that he saw her only as a friend. Flav and Goldie leave on very good terms, and Goldie gives heartfelt goodbye hugs to Pumkin and Hoopz. Also she says that she feels sorry for New York because now that she is gone \"no one will talk to her.\"\n* '''Challenge:''' spa, zoo\n* '''Eliminated:''' Goldie\n; Reasons for elimination\n* Goldie: Flav felt more of a friendship connection with Goldie\n\n===\"Family Flavors\"===\n''First aired February 26, 2006''\n\n:Flav goes on outings with the three remaining girls' parents. He takes Pumkin and her mother Teri to get a manicure and a pedicure, takes Hoopz and her mother Donna to [[Medieval Times]], and takes New York and her parents Alex and Michelle ([[Michelle Rothschild-Patterson|Sister Patterson]]) to the Santa Malibu Tennis Resort. During Pumkin's outing, her mother reveals to Flav that Pumkin had also appeared on ''[[Blind Date (US TV series)|Blind Date]]'', a fact that was known to the other girls, but not to Flav. Her mother also told Flav she had been on a number of other game shows, such as [[Family Feud]]. Hoopz expresses her feeling that if she doesn't hook up with Flav at the end of the day, her mother might, since they took to themselves quite a bit. On the way to the tennis resort, New York's mother proclaims that her daughter has gotten fat, which embarrasses New York. Flav does not hit it off with New York's mother, who loudly expresses her objections to any possibility of her daughter marrying Flav.\n\n:Pumkin's failure to tell Flav about her past appearance on ''Blind Date'' leads to her elimination at the end of the episode. During the elimination ceremony, in an attempt to ruin New York's image in front of Flav, Pumkin claims that New York is an aspiring actress, which ignites a heated exchange between the two women. While Pumkin is saying goodbye to Hoopz, New York urges her to hurry up and exit the set, to which Pumkin replies, 'actually I can slap the shit out of you, 'cuz you need to shut the f**k up!!' New York responds, 'DO IT, SLAP ME, BITCH!!!!', Pumkin responds by spitting in New York's face, causing New York to push Pumkin into the cameras, while yelling, 'YOU MUTHA F***ING WHORE!!!!' at Pumkin. New York makes further attempt to attack Pumkin, who hides behind the crew on set and eventually storms out of the mansion.\n\n:Outside the mansion, Pumkin states that she no longer cares for Flav, and if he should pick New York in the end, he would get what he deserves. She also threatens to come back to the show with a gun to shoot New York. She later denied saying this on her Myspace page, stating that her ''VH1'' contract entitled them to cut off the rest of her words when they like. In an interview,<ref name=\"Pumkin interview\">{{Cite news|last = Burger |first = David |url = http://www.bakersfield.com/102/story/38985.html |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060314153800/http://www.bakersfield.com/102/story/38985.html|archivedate =14 March 2006 |title = 'Pumkin' off reality TV, but her spit added spice |newspaper = [[The Bakersfield Californian]]|date =  6 March 2006|accessdate = 29 December 2006}}</ref> Pumkin denied spitting in New York's face. She claims to have been told by producers that she would be leaving before this was filmed and to give them a \"big ending.\" She asked what kind of an ending they wanted and they suggested spitting. She also claims that the spit was digitally enhanced. Regardless, the incident is considered the most shocking and popular moment of the entire series.\n\n:Back in the mansion, Flav gives New York her clock. But before doing so, he asks her if she really wants the clock. She says she does, but she wants to \"beat Pumkin's ass\" for spitting on her. When the clock ceremony is over, Flav directs the two finalists to pack their bags because they're going to [[Mexico]]. This excites them, especially New York. She says that she will forget about the situation between her and Pumkin for now, but vows that she will settle it at a later point. While New York and Hoopz are getting ready for their flight to Mexico, New York runs back downstairs to fight Pumkin. The producers tell her that if she engages in a fight with Pumkin, she will not go to Mexico (this scene was revealed at the recap episode).\n\n:This episode is also notable for the fact that the mothers of Hoopz and New York reveal their daughters' real names (\"Nikki\" and \"Tiffany,\" respectively) on air.\n* '''Challenge:''' Meet the parents\n* '''Eliminated:''' Pumkin\n; Reasons for elimination\n* Pumkin: For her failure to tell Flav she had been on many other TV shows, and he felt Pumkin was more on his show for fame.\n\n===\"For Flav's Consideration\"===\n''First aired March 5, 2006''\n\n:This episode was made to take a look back on this season of \"dating, mating, and eliminating.\" Also, it showed never-before-seen footage. They included:\n:* New York and Hoopz's casting tapes\n:* The extended van fight between Rain and New York\n:* A fight between Pumkin and New York that was not shown\n:* An argument between [[Brigitte Nielsen]] and Flavor Flav\n:* Hoopz and New York getting fitted for gold teeth\n:* The extended version of the Pumkin and New York \"spit incident\"\n\n===\"Flavor of Decision\" aka \"Viva La Flav\"===\n''First aired March 12, 2006''\n\n:The final two contestants, Hoopz and New York, take a trip to [[Mexico]] with Flav. They each get a 24-hour period to spend alone with Flav, and the first to go is New York. Flav decides to test her (because of her dislike for the outdoors) by taking her to a secluded beach for some [[kayaking]]. Later, during dinner, Flav gives New York a necklace with her show name on it. They then head back to the hotel, where the determined New York decides to share his bed that night. She later tells Hoopz that they didn't have sex but were \"making music\" and \"making love\" all night. Hoopz has her date with Flav the next day, and they ride [[zip line]]s through the jungle. During their dinner, Hoopz also receives a necklace and they proceed to spend the evening cuddling.\n\n:After returning from Mexico, the women are treated (separately) to a day of dress shopping and getting their hair done for the impending final elimination ceremony. New York loves her dress and her hairdo, while Hoopz feels her hairstyle and choice of dress makes her look ugly. At the elimination, both women arrive wearing the same dress, and make comments about how bad it looks on the other. After being certain that neither woman will be angry with him for choosing the other, Flav apologizes to New York and tells her that his choice is Hoopz. New York spends the limo ride questioning if it really just happened that way, and questioning why Flav would do that to her. Back in the house, Flav presents Hoopz with a set of gold teeth that match his own.\n* '''Winner:''' Hoopz\n* '''Runner up:''' New York\n\n===\"After the Lovin' (Finale)\"===\n''First aired April 2, 2006''\n\n:All of the contestants are invited back to talk and take a look at highlights of the season, including the vomiting, the infamous spitting, and general cat-fighting. Many of the early cuts on the show such as Apples, Dimplez and Picasso look out of place at the reunion. Flav gives a hug to Smokey. The host, [[Alani Vasquez|La La]], believing that Red Oyster (who is now known to be Flav's lookout) has her own secrets that need to be revealed. She then announced to everyone that Red Oyster was married while on the show. Oyster claims to be divorced, both now and then. Flav believes her, but the other former contestants do not. Rain and Georgia then confront Red Oyster, and call Red Oyster a \"snitch\". Flav tries to explain to Rain and Georgia that when Red Oyster was informing him of what was going on in the house, that she was just being his lookout. Rain and Georgia then point out that Red Oyster isn't doing it for him, that Red Oyster's doing it for herself, just so she can win the competition. Rain and Red Oyster then begin a vulgarity-laced exchange. Miss Latin and Red Oyster argue over Miss Latin calling her ex-boyfriend from Flav's mansion. Serious, a model before the show, maintains that she was genuinely interested in Flav and was not on the show to boost her career. Next, the most anticipated part of the show, Pumkin and New York's first reunion since Pumkin's elimination. New York is brought out first and begins to argue with Cherry. This argument started when Cherry questioned Flav about why he kept New York if he wanted harmony in his house. New York asks her why she should even matter because she was one of the first to be eliminated. They yell at each other, which leads to Cherry getting escorted out. Pumkin then comes out and New York attempts to \"bitch slap\" her. They later attempt to solve their problems with words. Pumkin tells her what's on her mind with the time she received. New York spends her time by knocking over one of the boards that separated the two and attempting to attack Pumkin once again. When Big Rick caught her, her [[breasts]] were exposed. Pumkin runs from New York into the audience to Rain and Georgia and says, \"I didn't come on no [[The Jerry Springer Show|Jerry fucking Springer]], get the fucking psycho bitch outta here!\" Later, Hoopz is brought out to discuss her relationship with Flav. He says he needs her to explain because he doesn't understand what happened. Hoopz reveals that her connection with Flav was not \"like that\" sort of connection. Flav announces that there will be a [[Flavor of Love 2|Second Season]] of the series, to once again attempt to find \"the next great love of his life.\"\n\n==DVD release==\nThe complete first season came out on DVD on August 29, 2006.

When naming the girls, the first person to receive her name is \"Oyster,\" a name she dislikes. Flav gives all of the girls nicknames, but cannot think of one for a particular girl, who tells him she likes scuba diving, so he names her 'Shellz.' Oyster then reveals that she has worn red clothing every day for six years straight, and decides to name herself \"Red Oyster.\" Hottie is very aggressive with Flav, which he likes. New York makes a comment about all of the girls being \"a loud pack of idiot bitches,\" which sparked her reputation for being the villainess. Goldie drinks too much champagne, vomits, and passes out. Hottie is the first to receive a clock, and Rain manages to get Goldie standing in time for the elimination ceremony, and she is the last person to receive her clock. On her way out Cherry cries and wonders how \"Goldie, who puked in bucket, a gallon of puke\" stays. Smokey, Shellz, Picasso, and Bubblez are also eliminated.\n* '''Eliminated:''' Bubblez, Shellz, Smokey, Picasso, Cherry\n;Reasons for elimination\n* Flav felt he hadn't gotten to know any of the 5 girls\n\n===\"Rub a Dub Flav\"===\n''First aired January 7, 2006\n\n:The fifteen remaining contestants engage in a competition where Flav has 10 minutes to spend with each woman in a private hot tub. In the van on the way to the resort, Rain and New York get into a heated argument over New York's unfriendliness toward the other contestants. At the resort, contestants prepare themselves and their hot tub with candles and drinks to keep Flav entertained. Some of the hot tub settings are nice, but some are strange, such as Hottie's. Flav states \"Hottie is very 'dramatical.' She tried to 'hypnotize' me!\" In the end, Flav picks Smiley, New York, and Miss Latin for a private roller skating date, where Smiley reveals she was previously married. (It was revealed in the reunion show that she was only divorced one week before the taping of the show.) Later at the house, Pumkin confronts New York about her unfriendliness towards some of the other contestants in the house, resulting in the two of them fighting and exchanging insults, but Red Oyster, Hottie, and Rain try to break up the ruckus. Red Oyster and Hottie protect New York, and Rain protects Pumkin, while Pumkin screams \"you bitch!\" at New York. Red Oyster passes along information to Flav that Miss Latin has been calling her ex-boyfriend, Kash, from the house, saying not to hang up. He hangs up on her. Miss Latin, Rain, Georgia, Apples, and Dimplez are eliminated. Apples' and Dimplez's names are never revealed on-screen.\n* '''Challenge:''' to keep flav entertained in a hot tub\n* '''Winners:''' Smiley, New York, Miss Latin\n* '''Eliminated:''' Georgia, Rain, Dimplez, Miss Latin, Apples\n;Reasons for elimination\n* Georgia: Flav still hadn't gotten to know her\n* Rain: Flav felt she had a bit of a temper\n* Dimplez: She didn't stand out\n* Apples: She didn't stand out\n* Miss Latin: Flav found out she was calling her ex from his house\n\n===\"A Friend of Flav's is a Friend of Mine\"===\n''First aired January 15, 2006\n\n:Flav takes the women to visit some of his \"old friends\" as well as some \"new friends.\" The five contestants who are taken to meet Flav's \"old friends\" suspect that they will be meeting his celebrity friends (most notably the other members of [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]]) but are surprised when they arrive at a senior center where their challenge is to care for and socialize with the elderly. Some girls have fun with the challenge, while some, such as New York, are uncomfortable. Sweetie wins and surprises Flav with her refusal to kiss him, saying it would take about three more weeks.\n\n:The five contestants that go to meet Flav's \"new friends\" are taken to a park where they are challenged to organize and execute a birthday party for young children. Though Pumkin thought she would win, everyone was surprised when Serious did. New York walks out of the senior citizen center when a woman asks her for help with her false teeth, and Pumkin, a substitute teacher, cries after Flav says she was the most distant when playing with the children.\n\nNew York accuses Hottie of stealing her jacket because she had made statements that she was so competitive that she might cut up someone's clothes to win. Hottie rebuffs New York, saying New York is just jealous, because Hottie believes she looks like [[Beyonc\u00e9]]. New York tells her she looks more like [[Luther Vandross]]. New York's exact words from the unrated DVD to [[Beyonc\u00e9]] was \" Beyonce, sweetie, I'm so sorry that an ugly ass bitch like this would even say that, oh my god.\" Serious [[Indecent exposure|showed her breasts]] to Hottie and says that if Hottie's \"double D's\" don't look like hers, it shouldn't matter. New York and Pumkin then begin confronting Hottie. Hottie tells Pumkin, \"you need to learn how to read.\" Pumkin comes back at Hottie with, \"I can read you, fat fucking bitch that's all I need to read.\" New York tells Hottie if something in the house goes missing that she would always come to Hottie, because Hottie has a history of stealing, and due to a few comments Hottie made about being so competitive that she would \"cut clothes, steal things, etc.\"\n\nNeither New York nor Hottie is happy when Flav gives them both clocks. Serious does not receive a clock because Red Oyster informs Flav that she believes that she is only here to further her career in modeling. Peaches is also eliminated as well.\n* '''Challenge:''' to meet some \"old\" and \"new\" friends\n* '''Winners:''' Sweetie (old), Serious (new)\n* '''Eliminated:''' Serious, Peaches\n; Reasons for elimination\n* Serious: Red Oyster told Flav that Serious was only there to further her career in modeling.\n* Peaches: Flav said he wasn't feeling her.\n\n===\"The Flavor of Chicken\"===\n''First aired January 22, 2006\n\n:The contestants try to impress Flav's mother (Anna Drayton) by accompanying her to church, introducing themselves over tea and pastries at a [[tea room]] and by attempting to cook [[fried chicken]]. Hottie ends up attempting to cook her chicken in the microwave, stuffed with raw vegetables, leaving it raw during the presentation to Flav and his mother. Hottie thought the button that said 'chicken' meant that it would cook an entire chicken. Goldie, says \"Bitch is crazy!\" Hoopz wins the cooking competition. Sweetie is disappointed because she hates chicken after an incident when she was five, and is angry that she cooked a chicken for nothing. Hoopz then has dinner with Flav and his mother, who warms up to Hoopz after being indifferent to her in the beginning. Sweetie is eliminated, as Flav doubts whether she really likes him. Sweetie throws a tantrum because she feels that she has shown him several times that she likes him (cooking a chicken, staying up late for a date, etc.) She felt that he left a lot of \"jokes\" in his house, referring to New York, Red Oyster and Hottie. She tells Flav off as she exits the house and calls Flav \"retarded\" in a New Jersey accent, and the other girls are shocked.\n* '''Challenge:''' to make fried chicken\n* '''Winner:''' Hoopz\n* '''Eliminated:''' Sweetie\n; Reason for elimination\n* Sweetie: Flav doubted that she had love for him\n\n===\"What Happens in Flavor Stays in Flavor\"===\n''First aired January 29, 2006\n\n:Flav takes the seven remaining girls to [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] to test their luck, literally, at a [[roulette]] table. Each girl is given $100 in chips and 10 minutes at the wheel. Several of the girls blow their entire stake in one roll. New York won the most money for Flav by winning $465, and earned herself a one-on-one date with him that night. New York confesses her love for Flav, and Flav is troubled when New York admits that she would be upset if he were to kiss other women. Flav is turned off by New York's jealous ways.\n\n:While New York and Flav were on the date, Hoopz, Goldie, Hottie, Red Oyster, Pumkin, and Smiley went to a [[strip club]]. Hoopz is convinced Red Oyster and Hottie are going to tattle on them for going there. When they return from Vegas, Flav organizes a \"Five Senses\" challenge. Throughout the entire competition, Smiley and New York were the runaway leaders in terms of points accumulated. For the final part of the challenge, Smiley does a very erotic dance (which is not censored on the DVD). New York attempts an erotic dance and nearly falls through the privacy screen (so Flav could not tell who was who). Due to New York's gaffe, Smiley wins, and she spends time with Flav in his hot tub.\n\n:During the elimination ceremony at the end of the episode, Red Oyster announces that she is eliminating herself from the competition to be with her father, who she has just found out was in a serious car accident. Flav tells Red Oyster he is sorry to see her go because he would have saved her from elimination. New York and Hottie had not received clocks at that time, and were saved from elimination, even though one of them was scheduled to leave that night. New York was troubled because she desperately wanted to know if she would have received a clock or not. Red Oyster hugs her alliance \"New York\" on her way out. Hottie tells Red Oyster that the same thing happened to her, but Red Oyster insults her, Red Oyster also reveals to Hottie that it was Red Oyster herself that ripped the pages out of Hottie's diary, because she didn't like Hottie trying to start something between Red Oyster and her ally New York.\n* '''Challenge:''' Roulette\n* '''Winner:''' New York\n* '''Challenge:''' Five Senses\n* '''Winner:''' Smiley\n* '''Quit:''' Red Oyster\n; Reason for withdrawal\n* Red Oyster: Red Oyster had found out her father was in a very serious car crash, and wanted to be home to be there with him.\n\n===\"InterroGitted\"===\n''First aired February 12, 2006\n\n:Flav's old flame, [[Brigitte Nielsen]], visits the house to administer [[lie detector]] tests to the six remaining contestants. While having his hair braided, Flav sees Hottie on an episode of ''[[Blind Date (US TV series)|Blind Date]]'', where she states that she is looking to date a man who will spend money on her. He calls Hoopz, Smiley, Pumkin and Goldie, who happened to be nearby, into his bedroom, and they are shocked at what they see. Later, Pumkin reveals to the girls that she has also been on ''Blind Date'', but doesn't tell Flav. The lie detector test shows that Hottie lied about her age and her body measurements. Goldie was the only one who was completely truthful on her test, though Smiley was honest in admitting she still loved her ex-husband and was previously a stripper. Hoopz spends the majority of the night arguing with [[Brigitte Nielsen]], and abruptly leaves a dinner Brigitte threw in their honor, but Hoopz manages to escape elimination. Smiley reveals her past as an exotic dancer, then argues with New York after admitting that she still has feelings for her ex-husband. New York passes this information on to Flav, but refuses to mention Smiley directly. Pumkin readily volunteers Smiley's name. When Flav meets with Brigitte, she tells Flav that ''none'' of the girls are right for him. Flav eliminates Hottie for not being truthful, & for coming across as a 'gold-digger' on \"Blind Date\". Flav had a clock for Smiley but chose not to give it to her for having issues with her ex-husband.\n* '''Challenge:''' Lie detector test\n* '''Winner:''' Goldie\n* '''Eliminated:''' Hottie, Smiley\n; Reasons for elimination\n* Hottie: Flav found footage of her on ''Blind Date'', in which she acted like a gold-digger, making Flav believe she was only after his money.\n* Smiley: Flav originally had a clock for her, but eliminated her so she could go home and work on her issues\n\n===\"Flav's Trippin'\"===\n''First aired February 19, 2006\n\n:The four remaining ladies go on an overnight trip with Flav. First, Pumkin and Hoopz go with Flav to a spa in [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]], California where they do [[yoga]], mud [[body painting]], and then all enjoy a clean-up shower together. During dinner, Pumkin uses Hoopz's restroom break as her opportunity to give Flav a personal letter, which indicated that she wanted to be intimate with him that night. After reading it, he later informs Hoopz that he and Pumkin are heading back to his room to spend the night together. For the second trip, Flav takes Goldie and New York to San Diego, where they visit the [[San Diego Zoo|World Famous San Diego Zoo]] and Flav chooses to spend the night with Goldie, though she just wants to be his friend. At the end of the episode Goldie is eliminated, claiming that he saw her only as a friend. Flav and Goldie leave on very good terms, and Goldie gives heartfelt goodbye hugs to Pumkin and Hoopz. Also she says that she feels sorry for New York because now that she is gone \"no one will talk to her.\"\n* '''Challenge:''' spa, zoo\n* '''Eliminated:''' Goldie\n; Reasons for elimination\n* Goldie: Flav felt more of a friendship connection with Goldie\n\n===\"Family Flavors\"===\n''First aired February 26, 2006\n\n:Flav goes on outings with the three remaining girls' parents. He takes Pumkin and her mother Teri to get a manicure and a pedicure, takes Hoopz and her mother Donna to [[Medieval Times]], and takes New York and her parents Alex and Michelle ([[Michelle Rothschild-Patterson|Sister Patterson]]) to the Santa Malibu Tennis Resort. During Pumkin's outing, her mother reveals to Flav that Pumkin had also appeared on ''[[Blind Date (US TV series)|Blind Date]]'', a fact that was known to the other girls, but not to Flav. Her mother also told Flav she had been on a number of other game shows, such as [[Family Feud]]. Hoopz expresses her feeling that if she doesn't hook up with Flav at the end of the day, her mother might, since they took to themselves quite a bit. On the way to the tennis resort, New York's mother proclaims that her daughter has gotten fat, which embarrasses New York. Flav does not hit it off with New York's mother, who loudly expresses her objections to any possibility of her daughter marrying Flav.\n\n:Pumkin's failure to tell Flav about her past appearance on ''Blind Date'' leads to her elimination at the end of the episode. During the elimination ceremony, in an attempt to ruin New York's image in front of Flav, Pumkin claims that New York is an aspiring actress, which ignites a heated exchange between the two women. While Pumkin is saying goodbye to Hoopz, New York urges her to hurry up and exit the set, to which Pumkin replies, 'actually I can slap the shit out of you, 'cuz you need to shut the f**k up!!' New York responds, 'DO IT, SLAP ME, BITCH!!!!', Pumkin responds by spitting in New York's face, causing New York to push Pumkin into the cameras, while yelling, 'YOU MUTHA F***ING WHORE!!!!' at Pumkin. New York makes further attempt to attack Pumkin, who hides behind the crew on set and eventually storms out of the mansion.\n\n:Outside the mansion, Pumkin states that she no longer cares for Flav, and if he should pick New York in the end, he would get what he deserves. She also threatens to come back to the show with a gun to shoot New York. She later denied saying this on her Myspace page, stating that her ''VH1'' contract entitled them to cut off the rest of her words when they like.

She also claims that the spit was digitally enhanced. Regardless, the incident is considered the most shocking and popular moment of the entire series.\n\n:Back in the mansion, Flav gives New York her clock. But before doing so, he asks her if she really wants the clock. She says she does, but she wants to \"beat Pumkin's ass\" for spitting on her. When the clock ceremony is over, Flav directs the two finalists to pack their bags because they're going to [[Mexico]]. This excites them, especially New York. She says that she will forget about the situation between her and Pumkin for now, but vows that she will settle it at a later point. While New York and Hoopz are getting ready for their flight to Mexico, New York runs back downstairs to fight Pumkin. The producers tell her that if she engages in a fight with Pumkin, she will not go to Mexico (this scene was revealed at the recap episode).\n\n:This episode is also notable for the fact that the mothers of Hoopz and New York reveal their daughters' real names (\"Nikki\" and \"Tiffany,\" respectively) on air.\n* '''Challenge:''' Meet the parents\n* '''Eliminated:''' Pumkin\n; Reasons for elimination\n* Pumkin: For her failure to tell Flav she had been on many other TV shows, and he felt Pumkin was more on his show for fame.\n\n===\"For Flav's Consideration\"===\n''First aired March 5, 2006\n\n:This episode was made to take a look back on this season of \"dating, mating, and eliminating.\" Also, it showed never-before-seen footage. They included:\n:* New York and Hoopz's casting tapes\n:* The extended van fight between Rain and New York\n:* A fight between Pumkin and New York that was not shown\n:* An argument between [[Brigitte Nielsen]] and Flavor Flav\n:* Hoopz and New York getting fitted for gold teeth\n:* The extended version of the Pumkin and New York \"spit incident\"\n\n===\"Flavor of Decision\" aka \"Viva La Flav\"===\n''First aired March 12, 2006\n\n:The final two contestants, Hoopz and New York, take a trip to [[Mexico]] with Flav. They each get a 24-hour period to spend alone with Flav, and the first to go is New York. Flav decides to test her (because of her dislike for the outdoors) by taking her to a secluded beach for some [[kayaking]]. Later, during dinner, Flav gives New York a necklace with her show name on it. They then head back to the hotel, where the determined New York decides to share his bed that night. She later tells Hoopz that they didn't have sex but were \"making music\" and \"making love\" all night. Hoopz has her date with Flav the next day, and they ride [[zip line]]s through the jungle. During their dinner, Hoopz also receives a necklace and they proceed to spend the evening cuddling.\n\n:After returning from Mexico, the women are treated (separately) to a day of dress shopping and getting their hair done for the impending final elimination ceremony. New York loves her dress and her hairdo, while Hoopz feels her hairstyle and choice of dress makes her look ugly. At the elimination, both women arrive wearing the same dress, and make comments about how bad it looks on the other. After being certain that neither woman will be angry with him for choosing the other, Flav apologizes to New York and tells her that his choice is Hoopz. New York spends the limo ride questioning if it really just happened that way, and questioning why Flav would do that to her. Back in the house, Flav presents Hoopz with a set of gold teeth that match his own.\n* '''Winner:''' Hoopz\n* '''Runner up:''' New York\n\n===\"After the Lovin' (Finale)\"===\n''First aired April 2, 2006\n\n:All of the contestants are invited back to talk and take a look at highlights of the season, including the vomiting, the infamous spitting, and general cat-fighting. Many of the early cuts on the show such as Apples, Dimplez and Picasso look out of place at the reunion. Flav gives a hug to Smokey. The host, [[Alani Vasquez|La La]], believing that Red Oyster (who is now known to be Flav's lookout) has her own secrets that need to be revealed. She then announced to everyone that Red Oyster was married while on the show. Oyster claims to be divorced, both now and then. Flav believes her, but the other former contestants do not. Rain and Georgia then confront Red Oyster, and call Red Oyster a \"snitch\". Flav tries to explain to Rain and Georgia that when Red Oyster was informing him of what was going on in the house, that she was just being his lookout. Rain and Georgia then point out that Red Oyster isn't doing it for him, that Red Oyster's doing it for herself, just so she can win the competition. Rain and Red Oyster then begin a vulgarity-laced exchange. Miss Latin and Red Oyster argue over Miss Latin calling her ex-boyfriend from Flav's mansion. Serious, a model before the show, maintains that she was genuinely interested in Flav and was not on the show to boost her career. Next, the most anticipated part of the show, Pumkin and New York's first reunion since Pumkin's elimination. New York is brought out first and begins to argue with Cherry. This argument started when Cherry questioned Flav about why he kept New York if he wanted harmony in his house. New York asks her why she should even matter because she was one of the first to be eliminated. They yell at each other, which leads to Cherry getting escorted out. Pumkin then comes out and New York attempts to \"bitch slap\" her. They later attempt to solve their problems with words. Pumkin tells her what's on her mind with the time she received. New York spends her time by knocking over one of the boards that separated the two and attempting to attack Pumkin once again. When Big Rick caught her, her [[breasts]] were exposed. Pumkin runs from New York into the audience to Rain and Georgia and says, \"I didn't come on no [[The Jerry Springer Show|Jerry fucking Springer]], get the fucking psycho bitch outta here!\" Later, Hoopz is brought out to discuss her relationship with Flav. He says he needs her to explain because he doesn't understand what happened. Hoopz reveals that her connection with Flav was not \"like that\" sort of connection. Flav announces that there will be a [[Flavor of Love 2|Second Season]] of the series, to once again attempt to find \"the next great love of his life.\"\n\n==DVD release==\nThe complete first season came out on DVD on August 29, 2006.

He helped the Dodgers to pennants in [[1977 World Series|1977]] and [[1978 World Series|1978]] and to the World Series championship in [[1981 World Series|1981]]. He managed the [[San Francisco Giants]], [[Chicago Cubs]], [[Cincinnati Reds]], and [[Washington Nationals]]. He led the Giants to the [[2002 World Series|2002 National League pennant]] and also reached the playoffs with the latter three teams.

As a Brave, he earned a spot as a footnote in history. On April 8, 1974, he was on deck when [[Hank Aaron]] hit home run 715 to pass [[Babe Ruth]] in career home runs.\n\nMany of Baker's accomplishments as a player came during his time with the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], which include playing for the [[National League]] [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] team in 1981 and 1982, and winning three League Championship series in [[1977 National League Championship Series|1977]], [[1978 National League Championship Series|1978]], and [[1981 National League Championship Series|1981]]. Baker ultimately won a [[World Series Trophy|World Series]] title in [[1981 World Series|1981]] with the Dodgers. However, Baker played poorly during the series, batting .167 with an [[On-base percentage|OBP]] of .192.<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1981_WS.shtml 1981 World Series - Los Angeles Dodgers over New York Yankees (4-2) | Baseball-Reference.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nAfter spending eight full seasons with the Braves and another eight with the Dodgers, as well as short tenures with both the [[San Francisco Giants]] and [[Oakland Athletics]], Baker finished his career as a player in 1986 with a .278 batting average, 242 [[home run]]s, and 1,013 [[runs batted in]].\n\nMany believe that Baker played an integral part in the first ever [[high five]], which occurred between Baker and Dodgers teammate [[Glenn Burke]] on October 2, 1977, at [[Dodger Stadium]], a story featured in the [[ESPN]] [[30 for 30]] documentary [http://espn.go.com/30for30/film?page=thehighfive \"The High Five\"] directed by Michael Jacobs.<ref name=\"mooallem\">Jon Mooallem.

It was a wild, triumphant moment and a good omen as the Dodgers headed to the playoffs. Burke, waiting on deck, thrust his hand enthusiastically over his head to greet his friend at the plate. Baker, not knowing what to do, smacked it. \"His hand was up in the air, and he was arching way back\", says Baker, now 68 and managing the Nationals. \"So I reached up and hit his hand.

In his first year as Giants manager, he won the [[Major League Baseball Manager of the Year Award|NL Manager of the Year]] award, leading the team to a 103\u201359 record, which was the second-best record in baseball that year (behind the 104\u201358 [[1993 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]]), and 31 games better than their 72\u201390 finish the previous year. His Giants went on to win division titles in [[1997 San Francisco Giants season|1997]] and again in [[2000 San Francisco Giants season|2000]]; Baker would win Manager of the Year honors in both of those years as well. It was during his San Francisco tenure that the term \"Dustiny\" was coined by former Giants pitcher [[Rod Beck]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/sports/jenkins/article/BRUCE-JENKINS-Season-of-Dustiny-In-One-3318019.php |title=Season of 'Dustiny' In One Bizarre Play / Fly ball-turned-homer symbolizes Giants' magic |first=Bruce |last=Jenkins |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=September 22, 1997}}</ref>\n\nIn [[2002 San Francisco Giants season|2002]], his Giants gained the wild-card berth and from there advanced to the [[2002 World Series|World Series]], where they lost in seven games to the [[2002 Anaheim Angels season|Anaheim Angels]], who were managed by his former Dodger teammate, [[Mike Scioscia]]. Baker is infamously known for removing [[Russ Ortiz]] during Game 6 of the [[2002 World Series]] despite Ortiz allowing only four hits.

[[Cito Gaston]] (the only African American manager to win a World Series) was the first, managing the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] to the championship in [[1992 World Series|1992]] and [[1993 World Series|1993]]. Baker was the second, and [[Ron Washington]] and [[Dave Roberts (outfielder)|Dave Roberts]] have since joined Gaston and Baker by managing the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] and [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], respectively, to the [[World Series]]. Baker also has the second most wins as manager in the San Francisco portion of Giants history; only [[Bruce Bochy]] has won more games since their move from New York.\n\n===Chicago Cubs===\n[[File:Baker and Cooper 2006.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Baker meeting with [[Cecil Cooper]] of the [[Houston Astros]] prior to a [[2006 Chicago Cubs season|2006]] matchup at [[Wrigley Field]].]]\nBaker made a major impact with the Cubs in 2003, his first season as manager for the ball club. With the help of an impressive pitching staff and big gun batters such as [[Sammy Sosa]] and [[Mois\u00e9s Alou]], the [[2003 Chicago Cubs season|Cubs]] were able to claim their first division title in 14 years. However, the Cubs\u2019 hopes for winning a [[World Series]] title were cut short during the [[2003 National League Championship Series]] against the [[2003 Florida Marlins season|Florida Marlins]], which included the infamous [[Steve Bartman Incident]] in Game 6 when the Cubs were up 3-0 and five outs from their first World Series appearance in almost 60 years. The Bartman incident proved to be a media distraction, but in fact it was critical execution failures by Cubs' players, such as a ball-four wild pitch, a fielding error on a would-be inning-ending double play, and a bad throw from the outfield after a single, which permitted the Marlins to score 8 runs in that eighth inning, to win the game 8-3. The Marlins would go on to win Game 7, and the [[2003 World Series]].\n\nIn [[2004 Chicago Cubs season|2004]], the team was involved in a heated [[Wild card (sports)#Major League Baseball|wild card]] chase with the [[2004 Houston Astros season|Houston Astros]], but fell out of contention near the season's end. In [[2005 Chicago Cubs season|2005]] the Cubs lost several of their key players, most notably ace pitchers [[Mark Prior]] and [[Kerry Wood]], to injuries. The team finished the season with a 79\u201383 record, marking the first time in three years that the Cubs finished with a losing record. The Cubs\u2019 performance continued to decline in [[2006 Chicago Cubs season|2006]] as they fell to 66\u201396<ref name=\"managerial record\"/> and finished last in the entire [[National League]].\n\nA month after that season ended, the Cubs declined to renew Baker's contract. They allowed Baker to address the media in a press conference in early October, where he officially announced his departure. The Cubs turned to [[Lou Piniella]] to replace Baker for the [[2007 Chicago Cubs season]]. Baker finished his tenure with a regular season record of 322 wins and 326 losses and a post-season record of six wins and six losses.<ref name=\"managerial record\"/>\n\n===Cincinnati Reds===\n[[File:DustybakerRedsfest.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Dusty Baker sporting his new Reds jersey at RedsFest 2007.]]\nOn October 13, 2007, Baker was hired as manager of the Cincinnati Reds, replacing interim manager [[Pete Mackanin]].<ref>{{cite news|work=Los Angeles Times |title=Reds give Dusty Baker a three-year deal |url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-newswire14oct14,1,4876134.story?coll=la-headlines-sports |accessdate=October 14, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024202900/http://latimes.com/sports/la-sp-newswire14oct14,1,4876134.story?coll=la-headlines-sports |archivedate=October 24, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Baker and the Reds finished 74-88 and 78-84 in [[2008 Cincinnati Reds season|2008]] and [[2009 Cincinnati Reds season|2009]], finishing 5th and 4th in the [[National League Central|NL Central]].

The [[2003 NLDS]] with the Cubs was only his third series win, and he never got past the Division Series in any of his next five postseason appearances with the Reds or Nationals.

The Giants lost 12-1 on the final day of the season when a win could have forced a tiebreaking game with Atlanta for the division championship. In 2002, the Giants led the [[2002 World Series|World Series]] against the Anaheim Angels 3 games to 2. San Francisco had a 5-0 lead in the seventh inning of the sixth game, but allowed the Angels to score six unanswered runs in the seventh and eighth innings to win. The Angels also won Game 7 to win the championship. In 2003, Baker's Cubs led the [[2003 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]] 3 games to 1 against the Florida Marlins. The Marlins stormed back to win the final three games of the series, including overcoming a 3-0 Chicago lead with 8 runs in the eighth inning of Game 6. The loss in that game was blamed in part on poor managing, notably leaving starter Mark Prior in the game when he had already thrown over 100 pitches. In 2012, Baker's Reds led the [[2012 National League Division Series|National League Division Series]] 2 games to 0 against the San Francisco Giants. With the final three games of the series at home in Cincinnati, the Reds needed to win just once to advance to the National League Championship Series, but the Giants completed the comeback by winning games 3, 4, and 5 and went on to win the World Series. The Reds also suffered a six-game losing streak to end the 2013 season, including a loss in the [[2013 National League Wild Card Game|Wild Card]] game at Pittsburgh. Reds general manager [[Walt Jocketty]] admitted the team's latest collapse played a role in the decision to fire Baker.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/9767640/manager-dusty-baker-fired-3-days-cincinnati-reds-ouster|title= Reds dismiss manager Dusty Baker|date=October 4, 2013|work=ESPN|accessdate=October 5, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Managerial record===\n\n{{updated|games played on October 13, 2017}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" Style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Team!!rowspan=\"2\"|From!!rowspan=\"2\"|To!!colspan=\"4\"|Regular season record!!colspan=\"4\"|Post\u2013season record\n|-\n!{{Tooltip|G|Games managed}}!!{{Tooltip|W|Games won}}!!{{Tooltip|L|Games lost}}!!{{Tooltip|Win %|Winning percentage}}!!{{Tooltip|G|Games managed}}!!{{Tooltip|W|Games won}}!!{{Tooltip|L|Games lost}}!!{{Tooltip|Win %|Winning percentage}}\n|-\n|[[San Francisco Giants]]||[[1993 San Francisco Giants season|1993]]||[[2002 San Francisco Giants season|2002]]\n|1555\n|{{WinLossPct|840|715}}\n|24\n|{{WinLossPct|11|13}}\n|-\n|[[Chicago Cubs]]||[[2003 Chicago Cubs season|2003]]||[[2006 Chicago Cubs season|2006]]\n|648\n|{{WinLossPct|322|326}}\n|12\n|{{WinLossPct|6|6}}\n|-\n|[[Cincinnati Reds]]||[[2008 Cincinnati Reds season|2008]]||[[2013 Cincinnati Reds season|2013]]\n|972\n|{{WinLossPct|509|463}}\n|9\n|{{WinLossPct|2|7}}\n|-\n|[[Washington Nationals]]||[[2016 Washington Nationals season|2016]]||[[2017 Washington Nationals season|2017]]\n|324\n|{{WinLossPct|192|132}}\n|10\n|{{WinLossPct|4|6}}\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\"| Total\n!3499\n!{{WinLossPct|1863|1636}}\n!55\n!{{WinLossPct|23|32}}\n|-\n!colspan=\"11\"|{{Tooltip|Ref.|Reference}}:<ref name=\"managerial record\"/>\n|}\n\n==Broadcasting career==\nBaker served as an [[ESPN]] analyst during the 2006 MLB Postseason and served in a similar role during the 2007 season.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-01-25/sports/0701250142_1_managerial-candidate-giants-and-cubs-nl-central-title |title=Baker's ESPN job has out for managing |date=January 25, 2007 |first=Mark |last=Gonzales |work=Chicago Tribune}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/espn-signs-baker-baseball-130138 |title=ESPN signs Baker for baseball |first=Paul J. |last=Gough |date=February 14, 2007 |work=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref> In 2015, Baker joined [[Major League Baseball on TBS|TBS]] as a studio analyst for the final two weeks of their regular season coverage and for their coverage of the National League playoffs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://awfulannouncing.com/2015/aa-qa-new-mlb-on-tbs-analyst-dusty-baker-talks-return-to-tv-baseballs-changes-and-more.html|title=AA Q&A: New MLB on TBS Analyst Dusty Baker Talks Return to TV, Baseball's Changes, and More|last1=Bucholtz|first1=Andrew|date=September 17, 2015|website=Awful Announcing|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nBaker was a member of the [[United States Marine Corps Reserve]] from 1969 through 1975.<ref>[http://www.speaking.com/speakers/dustybaker.html Speakers Platform] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080219041252/http://www.speaking.com/speakers/dustybaker.html |date=February 19, 2008 }}</ref> Baker has a wife, Melissa, and two children named Natosha (born 1979) and Darren (born 1999).

However, Baker played poorly during the series, batting .167 with an [[On-base percentage|OBP]] of .192.<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1981_WS.shtml 1981 World Series - Los Angeles Dodgers over New York Yankees (4-2) | Baseball-Reference.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nAfter spending eight full seasons with the Braves and another eight with the Dodgers, as well as short tenures with both the [[San Francisco Giants]] and [[Oakland Athletics]], Baker finished his career as a player in 1986 with a .278 batting average, 242 [[home run]]s, and 1,013 [[runs batted in]].\n\nMany believe that Baker played an integral part in the first ever [[high five]], which occurred between Baker and Dodgers teammate [[Glenn Burke]] on October 2, 1977, at [[Dodger Stadium]], a story featured in the [[ESPN]] [[30 for 30]] documentary [http://espn.go.com/30for30/film?page=thehighfive \"The High Five\"] directed by Michael Jacobs.<ref name=\"mooallem\">Jon Mooallem.

In his first year as Giants manager, he won the [[Major League Baseball Manager of the Year Award|NL Manager of the Year]] award, leading the team to a 103\u201359 record, which was the second-best record in baseball that year (behind the 104\u201358 [[1993 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]]), and 31 games better than their 72\u201390 finish the previous year. His Giants went on to win division titles in [[1997 San Francisco Giants season|1997]] and again in [[2000 San Francisco Giants season|2000]]; Baker would win Manager of the Year honors in both of those years as well. It was during his San Francisco tenure that the term \"Dustiny\" was coined by former Giants pitcher [[Rod Beck]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/sports/jenkins/article/BRUCE-JENKINS-Season-of-Dustiny-In-One-3318019.php |title=Season of 'Dustiny' In One Bizarre Play / Fly ball-turned-homer symbolizes Giants' magic |first=Bruce |last=Jenkins |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=September 22, 1997}}</ref>\n\nIn [[2002 San Francisco Giants season|2002]], his Giants gained the wild-card berth and from there advanced to the [[2002 World Series|World Series]], where they lost in seven games to the [[2002 Anaheim Angels season|Anaheim Angels]], who were managed by his former Dodger teammate, [[Mike Scioscia]]. Baker is infamously known for removing [[Russ Ortiz]] during Game 6 of the [[2002 World Series]] despite Ortiz allowing only four hits.

[[Cito Gaston]] (the only African American manager to win a World Series) was the first, managing the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] to the championship in [[1992 World Series|1992]] and [[1993 World Series|1993]]. Baker was the second, and [[Ron Washington]] and [[Dave Roberts (outfielder)|Dave Roberts]] have since joined Gaston and Baker by managing the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] and [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], respectively, to the [[World Series]]. Baker also has the second most wins as manager in the San Francisco portion of Giants history; only [[Bruce Bochy]] has won more games since their move from New York.\n\n===Chicago Cubs===\n[[File:Baker and Cooper 2006.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Baker meeting with [[Cecil Cooper]] of the [[Houston Astros]] prior to a [[2006 Chicago Cubs season|2006]] matchup at [[Wrigley Field]].]]\nBaker made a major impact with the Cubs in 2003, his first season as manager for the ball club. With the help of an impressive pitching staff and big gun batters such as [[Sammy Sosa]] and [[Mois\u00e9s Alou]], the [[2003 Chicago Cubs season|Cubs]] were able to claim their first division title in 14 years. However, the Cubs\u2019 hopes for winning a [[World Series]] title were cut short during the [[2003 National League Championship Series]] against the [[2003 Florida Marlins season|Florida Marlins]], which included the infamous [[Steve Bartman Incident]] in Game 6 when the Cubs were up 3-0 and five outs from their first World Series appearance in almost 60 years. The Bartman incident proved to be a media distraction, but in fact it was critical execution failures by Cubs' players, such as a ball-four wild pitch, a fielding error on a would-be inning-ending double play, and a bad throw from the outfield after a single, which permitted the Marlins to score 8 runs in that eighth inning, to win the game 8-3. The Marlins would go on to win Game 7, and the [[2003 World Series]].\n\nIn [[2004 Chicago Cubs season|2004]], the team was involved in a heated [[Wild card (sports)#Major League Baseball|wild card]] chase with the [[2004 Houston Astros season|Houston Astros]], but fell out of contention near the season's end. In [[2005 Chicago Cubs season|2005]] the Cubs lost several of their key players, most notably ace pitchers [[Mark Prior]] and [[Kerry Wood]], to injuries. The team finished the season with a 79\u201383 record, marking the first time in three years that the Cubs finished with a losing record. The Cubs\u2019 performance continued to decline in [[2006 Chicago Cubs season|2006]] as they fell to 66\u201396<ref name=\"managerial record\"/> and finished last in the entire [[National League]].\n\nA month after that season ended, the Cubs declined to renew Baker's contract. They allowed Baker to address the media in a press conference in early October, where he officially announced his departure. The Cubs turned to [[Lou Piniella]] to replace Baker for the [[2007 Chicago Cubs season]]. Baker finished his tenure with a regular season record of 322 wins and 326 losses and a post-season record of six wins and six losses.<ref name=\"managerial record\"/>\n\n===Cincinnati Reds===\n[[File:DustybakerRedsfest.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Dusty Baker sporting his new Reds jersey at RedsFest 2007.]]\nOn October 13, 2007, Baker was hired as manager of the Cincinnati Reds, replacing interim manager [[Pete Mackanin]].<ref>{{cite news|work=Los Angeles Times |title=Reds give Dusty Baker a three-year deal |url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-newswire14oct14,1,4876134.story?coll=la-headlines-sports |accessdate=October 14, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024202900/http://latimes.com/sports/la-sp-newswire14oct14,1,4876134.story?coll=la-headlines-sports |archivedate=October 24, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Baker and the Reds finished 74-88 and 78-84 in [[2008 Cincinnati Reds season|2008]] and [[2009 Cincinnati Reds season|2009]], finishing 5th and 4th in the [[National League Central|NL Central]].

The Giants lost 12-1 on the final day of the season when a win could have forced a tiebreaking game with Atlanta for the division championship. In 2002, the Giants led the [[2002 World Series|World Series]] against the Anaheim Angels 3 games to 2. San Francisco had a 5-0 lead in the seventh inning of the sixth game, but allowed the Angels to score six unanswered runs in the seventh and eighth innings to win. The Angels also won Game 7 to win the championship. In 2003, Baker's Cubs led the [[2003 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]] 3 games to 1 against the Florida Marlins. The Marlins stormed back to win the final three games of the series, including overcoming a 3-0 Chicago lead with 8 runs in the eighth inning of Game 6. The loss in that game was blamed in part on poor managing, notably leaving starter Mark Prior in the game when he had already thrown over 100 pitches. In 2012, Baker's Reds led the [[2012 National League Division Series|National League Division Series]] 2 games to 0 against the San Francisco Giants. With the final three games of the series at home in Cincinnati, the Reds needed to win just once to advance to the National League Championship Series, but the Giants completed the comeback by winning games 3, 4, and 5 and went on to win the World Series. The Reds also suffered a six-game losing streak to end the 2013 season, including a loss in the [[2013 National League Wild Card Game|Wild Card]] game at Pittsburgh.
