After working as a [[demo (music)|demo]] singer in the mid 1980s, he signed with [[Epic Records]]' Nashville division in 1990. Between then and 2004, Diffie charted 35 singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart, five of which peaked at number one: his debut release \"[[Home (Joe Diffie song)|Home]]\", \"[[If the Devil Danced (In Empty Pockets)]]\", \"[[Third Rock from the Sun (song)|Third Rock from the Sun]]\", \"[[Pickup Man]]\" (his longest-lasting number-one song, at four weeks) and \"[[Bigger Than the Beatles]]\". In addition to these singles, he had 12 others reach the top 10 and ten more reach the top 40 on the same chart. He also co-wrote singles for [[Holly Dunn]], [[Tim McGraw]], and [[Jo Dee Messina]], and recorded with [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]], [[George Jones]], and [[Marty Stuart]].\n\nDiffie released seven studio albums, a Christmas album, and a greatest-hits package under the Epic label. He also released one studio album each through [[Monument Records]], [[Broken Bow Records]], and [[Rounder Records]]. Among his albums, 1993's ''[[Honky Tonk Attitude]]'' and 1994's ''[[Third Rock from the Sun]]'' are [[music recording sales certification|certified platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]], while 1992's ''[[Regular Joe (album)|Regular Joe]]'' and 1995's ''[[Life's So Funny]]'' are both certified gold. His album, ''[[Homecoming: The Bluegrass Album]]'', was released in late 2010 through Rounder. His style is defined by a [[neotraditionalist country]] influence with a mix of novelty songs and ballads.\n\n==Early life==\nJoe Diffie was born into a musical family in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], in 1958.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> His first musical performance came at age 14, when he performed in his Aunt Dawn Anita's country music band.<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/joe-diffie-mn0000787960/biography |title=Joe Diffie biography |accessdate=July 19, 2010 |last=Huey |first=Steve |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> Diffie's father, Joe R., played guitar and banjo, and his mother sang.

Later, he moved to [[Wisconsin]] for the years he was in sixth grade through his second year of high school, and back to Oklahoma, where he attended high school in [[Velma, Oklahoma|Velma]]. In his last two years in high school, Diffie played football, baseball, and golf in addition to running track; in his senior year, he was recognized as Best All-Around Male Athlete.<ref name=\"stambler\" />\n\nAfter graduating, he attended [[Cameron University]] in [[Lawton, Oklahoma]]. Although he initially earned credits toward medical school, he decided against a medical profession after marrying for the first time in 1977 and ultimately dropped out before graduation.<ref name=\"stambler\" /> Diffie first worked in oil fields, then drove a truck that pumped concrete in the oilfield in [[Alice, Texas]], before he moved back to Duncan to work in a [[foundry]]. During this period, he worked as a musician on the side, first in a gospel group called Higher Purpose, and then in a bluegrass band called Special Edition.<ref name=\"stambler\" /> Diffie then built a recording studio, began touring with Special Edition in adjacent states, and sent [[demo (music)|demonstration]] recordings to publishers in [[Nashville]]. [[Hank Thompson (musician)|Hank Thompson]] recorded Diffie's \"Love on the Rocks\", and [[Randy Travis]] put one of Diffie's songs on hold, but ultimately did not record it.<ref name=\"allmusic\" /><ref name=\"stambler\" />\n\nAfter the foundry closed in 1986, Diffie declared bankruptcy and sold the studio out of financial necessity.

After working as a [[demo (music)|demo]] singer in the mid 1980s, he signed with [[Epic Records]]' Nashville division in 1990. Between then and 2004, Diffie charted 35 singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart, five of which peaked at number one: his debut release \"[[Home (Joe Diffie song)|Home]]\", \"[[If the Devil Danced (In Empty Pockets)]]\", \"[[Third Rock from the Sun (song)|Third Rock from the Sun]]\", \"[[Pickup Man]]\" (his longest-lasting number-one song, at four weeks) and \"[[Bigger Than the Beatles]]\". In addition to these singles, he had 12 others reach the top 10 and ten more reach the top 40 on the same chart. He also co-wrote singles for [[Holly Dunn]], [[Tim McGraw]], and [[Jo Dee Messina]], and recorded with [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]], [[George Jones]], and [[Marty Stuart]].\n\nDiffie released seven studio albums, a Christmas album, and a greatest-hits package under the Epic label. He also released one studio album each through [[Monument Records]], [[Broken Bow Records]], and [[Rounder Records]]. Among his albums, 1993's ''[[Honky Tonk Attitude]]'' and 1994's ''[[Third Rock from the Sun]]'' are [[music recording sales certification|certified platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]], while 1992's ''[[Regular Joe (album)|Regular Joe]]'' and 1995's ''[[Life's So Funny]]'' are both certified gold. His album, ''[[Homecoming: The Bluegrass Album]]'', was released in late 2010 through Rounder. His style is defined by a [[neotraditionalist country]] influence with a mix of novelty songs and ballads.\n\n==Early life==\nJoe Diffie was born into a musical family in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], in 1958.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> His first musical performance came at age 14, when he performed in his Aunt Dawn Anita's country music band.<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/joe-diffie-mn0000787960/biography |title=Joe Diffie biography |accessdate=July 19, 2010 |last=Huey |first=Steve |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> Diffie's father, Joe R., played guitar and banjo, and his mother sang.

The cathedral city is [[Kristiansand]], Norway's fifth largest city. [[Kristiansand Cathedral]] serves as the seat of the presiding Bishop. The bishop since 2013 has been [[Stein Reinertsen]].  As of 1 January 2003, there were 347,324 members of the Church of Norway in the diocese.\n\n==History==\nIn 1125, the southern part of the [[Ancient Diocese of Bergen]] was split off as the [[Ancient Diocese of Stavanger]]. This new diocese stretched from the coast of [[Haugesund]] in the west to [[Gjernestangen]] between [[Ris\u00f8r]] and [[Krager\u00f8]], later the border stretched to [[Eidanger]] in the east. [[Stavanger]] was the [[cathedral]] city.  During the [[Protestant Reformation]], Norway became a Lutheran nation, establishing the [[Church of Norway]].
