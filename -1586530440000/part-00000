South Africa is a full member of the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC) with [[Test cricket|Test]], [[One-Day International]] (ODI) and [[Twenty20 International]] (T20I) status.\n\nSouth Africa entered first-class and international cricket at the same time when they hosted an [[England cricket team]] in the 1888\u201389 season. At first, the team was no match for Australia or England but, having gained in experience and expertise, they were able to field a competitive team in the first decade of the 20th century. The team regularly played against Australia, England and New Zealand through to the 1960s, by which time there was considerable opposition to the country's [[apartheid]] policy and an international ban was imposed by the ICC, commensurate with actions taken by other global sporting bodies. When the ban was imposed, South Africa had developed to a point where its team including [[Eddie Barlow]], [[Graeme Pollock]] and [[Mike Procter]] was arguably the best in the world and had just outplayed Australia.\n\nThe ban remained in place until 1991 and South Africa could then play against India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and the West Indies for the first time. The team since reinstatement has mostly been strong and has at times held number one positions in international rankings(had best ranking of No.1 in all three formats) but has lacked success in ICC organised tournaments. Outstanding players since reinstatement have included [[Allan Donald]], [[Makhaya Ntini]], [[Shaun Pollock]], [[Jacques Kallis]], [[Graeme Smith]], [[Kagiso Rabada]], [[AB de Villiers]], [[Dale Steyn]], [[Herschelle Gibbs]], [[Faf du Plessis]], [[Morne Morkel]], [[Imran Tahir]],[[David Miller (cricketer)|David Miller]] and [[Hashim Amla]].\n\n==History==\n===Beginnings and early developments===\n{{main|History of cricket in South Africa to 1918}}\nEuropean colonisation of southern Africa began on Tuesday, 6 April 1652 when the [[Dutch East India Company]] established a settlement called the [[Cape Colony]] on [[Table Bay]], near present-day [[Cape Town]], and continued to expand into the hinterland through the 17th and 18th centuries. It was founded as a victualling station for the Dutch East Indies trade route but soon acquired an importance of its own due to its good farmland and mineral wealth. There was no significant British interest in South Africa until 1795, when British troops under General Sir [[James Henry Craig]] seized Cape Colony during the [[French Revolutionary War]], the Netherlands having been occupied by French forces the same year. After the British seized Cape Colony a second time in 1806 to counteract French interests in the region in the course of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Cape Colony was turned into a permanent British settlement. As in most other parts of the world, British colonisation brought in its wake the introduction of the game of [[cricket]], which began to develop rapidly. The first ever recorded cricket match in South Africa took place in 1808, in Cape Town between two service teams for a prize of one thousand rix-dollars.<ref name=\"auto\">[http://bleacherreport.com/articles/79768-history-of-south-african-sport-vi-cricket History of South African sport \u2013 Cricket] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170909122025/http://bleacherreport.com/articles/79768-history-of-south-african-sport-vi-cricket |date=9 September 2017 }} BleacherReport. 9 November 2008.

In 1862, an annual fixture \"Mother Country v Colonial Born\" was staged for the first time in Cape Town. By the late 1840s, the game had spread from its early roots in Cape Colony and permeated the [[Afrikaners]] in the territories of [[Orange Free State]] and [[South African Republic|Transvaal]], who were descendants of the original Dutch settlers and were not considered naturally a cricket-playing people. In 1876, Port Elizabeth presented the \"Champion Bat\" for competition between South African towns. The first tournament was staged in [[Port Elizabeth]]. [[King William's Town Cricket Club|King William's Town]] won the tournament in 1876 and the following year, in 1877, too.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nIn 1888, [[Donald Currie|Sir Donald Currie]] sponsored the first [[English cricket team in South Africa in 1888\u201389|English team]] to tour South Africa. It was managed by [[Robert Warton (umpire)|Major R. G. Warton]] and captained by future Hollywood actor [[C. Aubrey Smith]]. The tour marked the advent, retrospectively, of both [[first-class cricket|first-class]] and [[Test cricket]] in South Africa. Currie donated the [[Sunfoil Series|Currie Cup]] (originally called the Kimberley Cup) that became the trophy, first won by [[Gauteng cricket team|Transvaal]] in 1889\u201390, for a national championship of the provincial teams in South Africa.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n===Early Test history===\nIn 1889, South Africa became the third test-playing nation when it played against England at Port Elizabeth,<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/current/match/62426.html South Africa's debut Test match 1889 scorecard] ESPNcricinfo.

However, these two matches, as was the case with all early matches involving the erstwhile 'South African XI' against all touring teams, did not receive the status of official 'Test' matches until South Africa formed the [[International Cricket Council|Imperial Cricket Conference]] with England and Australia in 1906. Neither did the touring English team organised by Major Warton even claim to be representing the [[England national cricket team|English cricket team]]; the matches were marketed as 'Major Warton's XI' v/s 'South African XI' instead. Even the players who participated did not know that they had played international cricket, and the side that played South Africa was regarded to be of weak county strength. The team was captained by C.A. Smith, a decent medium pacer from [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]], and for two of the Major Warton's XI, [[Basil Grieve]] and [[Charles Coventry (British Army officer)|The Honourable Charles Coventry]], the two Tests constituted their entire first-class career.

In addition to possessing batsmen such as Sinclair (the batsman with the highest [[strike rate]] in Test history){{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}, Nourse, Tancred, all-rounder Faulkner, Sherwell, Snooke, and White, the South Africans developed the world's first (and arguably greatest ever){{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} spin attack which specialised in [[googly]]. Greatest among the South African googly quartet was Schwarz, who inspired by English googly bowler [[Bernard Bosanquet (cricketer)|Bernard Bosanquet]], regarded as the inventor of the googly, developed into the most devastating googly bowler of his time. He taught diligently the secrets of the googly to allrounder Faulkner, medium-pacer Vogler and specialist batsman White, and together the four formed a quartet which began to lead South Africa to unprecedented heights in Test cricket.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Another important force during this period for South Africa were the all-round performances of Faulkner and Llewellyn. Faulkner came to be regarded as the first great South African all-rounders in the international game, regarded by some as even the greatest all-rounder in the world in the pre-1st World War period.<ref>[http://www.cricketcountry.com/articles/aubrey-faulkner-the-first-of-the-great-south-african-all-rounders-76039 Aubrey Faulkner: The first of the great South African all-rounders] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180909035413/https://www.cricketcountry.com/articles/aubrey-faulkner-the-first-of-the-great-south-african-all-rounders-76039 |date=9 September 2018 }} Cricket Country. 17 December 2015.

The side won ten out of their twenty-two matches, including a thrilling [[Result (cricket)#Tie|tie]] with [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]], who finished among the top four in that year's [[County Championship]], due to some magic weaved by Schwarz through his googlies. He repeated his heroics against an all-England XI, whom South Africa recorded an upset victory against by 189 runs. Unfortunately, the match was not accorded official Test status.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nIn 1906, England made a reciprocal [[English cricket team in South Africa in 1905\u201306|tour]] to South Africa, which this time consisted of a 5-match official Test series. The touring English team was second-string team, with only [[Colin Blythe]], [[Schofield Haigh]] and [[Jack Crawford (cricketer)|JN Crawford]] being those who could be considered regulars of the England team. Nevertheless, South Africa were still not favourites going into the series. However, in a shocking result at [[Johannesburg]], the inspired South Africans, led by Sherwell and their googly quartet, defeated England by 1 wicket, thereby recording her first Test win. Schwarz, Vogler and Faulkner led the way for South Africa.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Afterwards, South Africa defeated England by 9 wickets in the 2nd Test at Johannesburg, a 243-run win in the 3rd test at the same venue as well as an innings-and-16 runs victory at Cape Town in the 5th Test to secure a 4\u20131 domination of England.

His batting was also noted for quick footwork and exceptional 'backplay'.]]\n\nProdigious batsman Herbie Taylor was named captained of the South African team to face off against [[English cricket team in South Africa in 1913\u201314|the visiting English team]] in 1913\u201314, in what would prove South Africa's last international cricketing involvement before the First World War. Overall, the series was extremely poor for a South African side in transition, who failed to replicate the achievements of the South African sides 1905\u201306 and 1909\u201310, losing the 5-match Test series 4\u20130 against an extremely strong English side playing under the banner of the MCC. However, the series became memorable for Herbie Taylor's exceptional batting, who heralded his arrival as a new colossus in the world game, scoring a phenomenal 508 runs at an [[Batting average (cricket)|average]] of 50.80 against a terrific [[Sydney Barnes]] at his prime, who had claimed a record 49 wickets during the series [[Bowling average|at]] just 10.93. The cricket historian [[Harry Altham|H.S. Altham]] wrote: \"The English cricketers were unanimous that finer batting than his against Barnes at his best they never hoped to see.\" [[Neville Cardus]] noted it was \"perhaps the most skilful of all Test performances by a batsman.\" It also led Cardus to count Taylor as \"one of the six greatest batsmen of the post-Grace period\".\n\n===The inter-war years===\n{{main|History of cricket in South Africa from 1918\u201319 to 1945}}\nThe war brought in its wake the temporary suspension of international cricket. [[Sunfoil Series|The Currie Cup]], which had hitherto not been held during the years of [[Second Boer War|The Boer War]] (1899\u20131902) and on the years when England had visited as a touring team, faced cancellation during the years of war (1914\u201318).

The team's leading batsmen during this era were Mitchell, Nourse, Rowan, Melville, and van der Bijl. Nourse, in particular, became famous for his hand-eye co-ordination and his excellent fielding, one of many to be produced by South Africa in the coming decades; natural skills which were according to legend inspired and developed by his father Dave's refusal to coach him as a youngster, demanding that he learnt the rudiments of the game on his own, as he himself had. This South African team was also distinct from past South African teams in one respect: whereas the previous teams had been composed entirely of British-origin players, this team had Afrikaners like van der Bijl and Greeks such as Balaskas, regarded by wide consensus to be the greatest [[Greeks|Greek]] cricketer ever.<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Stern |editor-first=John |title=My Favourite Cricketer |publisher=[[A & C Black]] |location=London |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4081-2340-9 |chapter=Graeme Pollock |last=Kuper |first=Simon |authorlink=Simon Kuper |pages=118\u2013121}}</ref>\n\n===The post-war years===\n{{main|History of cricket in South Africa from 1945\u201346 to 1970}}\nThe South African cricket team toured England in 1947.

A notable ODI series loss to [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] at home in January 2013, and a further loss in [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]] highlighted South Africa's recent difficulties. Exits from the [[2012 ICC World Twenty20]] and the [[2013 ICC Champions Trophy]] only served to improve South Africa's reputation as 'chokers' in major tournaments. In the latter years of Smith's career, South Africa split the captaincy in the shorter forms of the game, with the ODI side being led by [[AB de Villiers]] and the T20I side by [[Faf du Plessis]]. After Smith's retirement, [[Hashim Amla]] was appointed captain of the test side, leading his side to victory in his first test in charge, in [[Galle]] in Sri Lanka.\n\n==Tournaments==\n{{see also|List of 400+ innings scores in ODIs}}\nSouth Africa has a record of failing to win major tournaments and is much-maligned because of this. The [[1992 Cricket World Cup]], for example, featured a rain-affected semi-final played before the introduction of the [[Duckworth-Lewis]] rain rule. South Africa needed 22 runs from 13 balls when rain intervened. After the delay they were left in the situation of requiring 22 runs from one ball to progress. In 1996 they were eliminated in the quarter-finals despite being one of the fancied teams and having qualified first in their group.In 1999 South Africa lost in the semi-final to eventual champions Australia. The match ended in a tie both South Africa and Australia managing 213 but [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] advanced to the Final as Australia finished higher than South Africa in the group.\n\nSouth Africa hosted the [[2003 Cricket World Cup]], but failed to progress beyond the group stage due to a misunderstanding of how many runs they needed to score in a rain-affected run chase. As a result of this, [[Shaun Pollock]] resigned as captain and was replaced by young batsman [[Graeme Smith]], although Pollock continued to play for the team. Under Smith's leadership, South Africa has achieved some success, although they have been hampered by the retirements of many star players, including fast bowler [[Allan Donald]] and one-day specialist [[Jonty Rhodes]]. As a result, they had a poor 2004, only winning against the [[West Indies cricket team|Windies]].\n\nIn the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]] they had a rollercoaster ride that included dominant wins over [[England national cricket team|England]], the West Indies, [[Ireland national cricket team|Ireland]], [[Netherlands national cricket team|Netherlands]] and [[Scotland national cricket team|Scotland]], and a narrow win over [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]], but devastating losses to Australia, [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] and Bangladesh that cost them the No. 1 ranking. Then they bowed out in the semi-finals with their lowest ever score in a World Cup as Australia bowled them out for 149 and won by 7 wickets.\n\nIn the [[2011 Cricket World Cup|2011 World Cup]], South Africa topped Group B with the distinction of bowling out every side they played within the 50 over limit, which also included a famous victory over hosts India. In the quarter final they were beaten by New Zealand after suffering a dramatic collapse and losing eight wickets for 64 runs.\n\nEven after many setbacks, their biggest heartbreak was awaiting them in the [[2015 Cricket World Cup|2015 World cup]] semi-final where they lost to the tournament runners up New Zealand in a rain affected tie. Batting first South Africa posted 281\u20135 and set a revised target of 298 to New Zealand, thanks to an amazing batting performance by [[Faf du Plessis]], [[David Miller (South African cricketer)|David Miller]] and captain [[AB de Villiers]]. Chasing a mammoth target of 298 New Zealand got off to a flier inspired by their captain [[Brendon McCullum]]. But the real hero of the match was [[Grant Elliott]], who scored 84* including a second-last ball six off the then world's best bowler [[Dale Steyn]]. This saw South Africa crash out of the 2015 World Cup despite playing some fantastic cricket throughout the entire tournament. After a good world cup South Africa went on to dominate ODI cricket in bilateral series which saw the Proteas rise to No. 1 in the [[ICC ODI Championship]].\n\nAt the [[2019 Cricket World Cup]] South Africa lost the opening match of the tournament to England and followed this up with losses to Bangladesh and India. Rained out against West Indies, they defeated Afghanistan but then lost to New Zealand and Pakistan, to end their chances of qualifying for the next stage.\n\nThey also hold the record of the highest successful run chase and made the highest total (the latter record has been surpassed) in One-Day Internationals (438\u20139 in 49.5 overs), in [[Australia in South Africa, 5th ODI, 2006|an iconic match]] against [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] on 12 March 2006. This game is considered by many to be the greatest One-Day International ever played.\n\nSouth Africa beat Netherlands by 231 runs in [[Mohali]] in Group matches in [[ICC World Cup 2011]], The 231-run win is the fourth largest margin of victory for any team in World Cups and the largest for South Africa in World Cups. It is also the second largest margin of victory for South Africa in ODIs on 3 March 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=Netherlands vs South Africa, ICC World Cup 2011|url=http://iccworld-cup2011.blogspot.com/2011/03/south-africa-vs-netherlands-mohali-3rd.html|date=March 2011|publisher=iccworld-cup2011.blogspot.com|access-date=3 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708042825/http://iccworld-cup2011.blogspot.com/2011/03/south-africa-vs-netherlands-mohali-3rd.html|archive-date=8 July 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\nThe 87-run stand between [[JP Duminy]] and [[Colin Ingram (cricketer)|Colin Ingram]] is the highest for the sixth wicket for South Africa in World Cups.

South Africa fielders may wear a green cap or a white sun hat with the king protea badge in the middle. Helmets are also coloured green. Before 1996, the cap insignia was the [[Cricket South Africa|United Cricket Board of South Africa]] old badge, which was a circle with a ball superimposed over a wicket in the center and the inscription which reads \"UNITED CRICKET BOARD OF SOUTH AFRICA\" around the circle's border. Prior to 1991, the cap insignia was a spingbok head with under the inscription \"S.A.C.B\" in yellow letters (which changed to \"S.A.\" with the years of the tour, for instance \"S.A. 1982\u201383\").\n\nIn [[limited overs cricket]], South Africa's ODI and Twenty20 shirts feature the king protea badge with the national flag on the left of the shirt, Standard Bank on the right side and the New Balance logo on the right sleeve. \nIn ODIs, the kit comprises a green shirt with yellow accents and dark green stylised protea leaves and green trousers, whilst the Twenty20 kit comprises a green shirt with a yellow gradient and the [[Oxigen Services|Oxigen]] logo in the front and green trousers. In both uniforms, the fielding hat is a green baseball cap with white piping and a yellow line on the visor border or a green sunhat, which are both green with the king protea badge.\nIn [[International Cricket Council|ICC]] limited-overs tournaments, a modified kit design is used with sponsor's logos moving to the sleeve and 'South Africa' printed across the front.\n\nSince 2016, South Africa played some matches with an all-pink version of its uniform, in order to raise breast cancer awareness.\n\nPrevious suppliers were ISC (1992\u20131996), Asics (1999), Admiral (2000\u20132003), Hummel (2004\u20132007) and Adidas (2011\u20132015).\n\nUntil 2016, the sponsor was [[Castle Lager]].\n\n==Squad==\nThis is a list of every active player to have played for South Africa in the last year (since 17 February 2019), and the forms of the game in which they have played.

[[Floral emblem|national flower]], ''[[Protea cynaroides]]'', commonly known as the \u2018king protea\u2019), is administered by [[Cricket South Africa]]. South Africa is a full member of the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC) with [[Test cricket|Test]], [[One-Day International]] (ODI) and [[Twenty20 International]] (T20I) status.\n\nSouth Africa entered first-class and international cricket at the same time when they hosted an [[England cricket team]] in the 1888\u201389 season. At first, the team was no match for Australia or England but, having gained in experience and expertise, they were able to field a competitive team in the first decade of the 20th century. The team regularly played against Australia, England and New Zealand through to the 1960s, by which time there was considerable opposition to the country's [[apartheid]] policy and an international ban was imposed by the ICC, commensurate with actions taken by other global sporting bodies. When the ban was imposed, South Africa had developed to a point where its team including [[Eddie Barlow]], [[Graeme Pollock]] and [[Mike Procter]] was arguably the best in the world and had just outplayed Australia.\n\nThe ban remained in place until 1991 and South Africa could then play against India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and the West Indies for the first time. The team since reinstatement has mostly been strong and has at times held number one positions in international rankings(had best ranking of No.1 in all three formats) but has lacked success in ICC organised tournaments. Outstanding players since reinstatement have included [[Allan Donald]], [[Makhaya Ntini]], [[Shaun Pollock]], [[Jacques Kallis]], [[Graeme Smith]], [[Kagiso Rabada]], [[AB de Villiers]], [[Dale Steyn]], [[Herschelle Gibbs]], [[Faf du Plessis]], [[Morne Morkel]], [[Imran Tahir]],[[David Miller]] and [[Hashim Amla]].\n\n==History==\n===Beginnings and early developments===\n{{main|History of cricket in South Africa to 1918}}\nEuropean colonisation of southern Africa began on Tuesday, 6 April 1652 when the [[Dutch East India Company]] established a settlement called the [[Cape Colony]] on [[Table Bay]], near present-day [[Cape Town]], and continued to expand into the hinterland through the 17th and 18th centuries. It was founded as a victualling station for the Dutch East Indies trade route but soon acquired an importance of its own due to its good farmland and mineral wealth. There was no significant British interest in South Africa until 1795, when British troops under General Sir [[James Henry Craig]] seized Cape Colony during the [[French Revolutionary War]], the Netherlands having been occupied by French forces the same year. After the British seized Cape Colony a second time in 1806 to counteract French interests in the region in the course of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Cape Colony was turned into a permanent British settlement. As in most other parts of the world, British colonisation brought in its wake the introduction of the game of [[cricket]], which began to develop rapidly. The first ever recorded cricket match in South Africa took place in 1808, in Cape Town between two service teams for a prize of one thousand rix-dollars.<ref name=\"auto\">[http://bleacherreport.com/articles/79768-history-of-south-african-sport-vi-cricket History of South African sport \u2013 Cricket] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170909122025/http://bleacherreport.com/articles/79768-history-of-south-african-sport-vi-cricket |date=9 September 2017 }} BleacherReport. 9 November 2008.

In 1862, an annual fixture \"Mother Country v Colonial Born\" was staged for the first time in Cape Town. By the late 1840s, the game had spread from its early roots in Cape Colony and permeated the [[Afrikaners]] in the territories of [[Orange Free State]] and [[South African Republic|Transvaal]], who were descendants of the original Dutch settlers and were not considered naturally a cricket-playing people. In 1876, Port Elizabeth presented the \"Champion Bat\" for competition between South African towns. The first tournament was staged in [[Port Elizabeth]]. [[King William's Town Cricket Club|King William's Town]] won the tournament in 1876 and the following year, in 1877, too.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nIn 1888, [[Donald Currie|Sir Donald Currie]] sponsored the first [[English cricket team in South Africa in 1888\u201389|English team]] to tour South Africa. It was managed by [[Robert Warton (umpire)|Major R. G. Warton]] and captained by future Hollywood actor [[C. Aubrey Smith]]. The tour marked the advent, retrospectively, of both [[first-class cricket|first-class]] and [[Test cricket]] in South Africa. Currie donated the [[Sunfoil Series|Currie Cup]] (originally called the Kimberley Cup) that became the trophy, first won by [[Gauteng cricket team|Transvaal]] in 1889\u201390, for a national championship of the provincial teams in South Africa.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n===Early Test history===\nIn 1889, South Africa became the third test-playing nation when it played against England at Port Elizabeth,<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/current/match/62426.html South Africa's debut Test match 1889 scorecard] ESPNcricinfo.

However, these two matches, as was the case with all early matches involving the erstwhile 'South African XI' against all touring teams, did not receive the status of official 'Test' matches until South Africa formed the [[International Cricket Council|Imperial Cricket Conference]] with England and Australia in 1906. Neither did the touring English team organised by Major Warton even claim to be representing the [[England national cricket team|English cricket team]]; the matches were marketed as 'Major Warton's XI' v/s 'South African XI' instead. Even the players who participated did not know that they had played international cricket, and the side that played South Africa was regarded to be of weak county strength. The team was captained by C.A. Smith, a decent medium pacer from [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]], and for two of the Major Warton's XI, [[Basil Grieve]] and [[Charles Coventry (British Army officer)|The Honourable Charles Coventry]], the two Tests constituted their entire first-class career. Even so, the nascent, fledgling 'South African XI' was very weak, losing both tests comfortably to England, English spinner [[Johnny Briggs (cricketer)|Johnny Briggs]] claiming 15\u201328 in the second Test at Cape Town.<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/436989.html The ignorant internationals] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170515095405/http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/436989.html |date=15 May 2017 }} Martin Williamson, ESPNcricinfo. 28 November 2009.

In addition to possessing batsmen such as Sinclair (the batsman with the highest [[strike rate]] in Test history){{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}, Nourse, Tancred, all-rounder Faulkner, Sherwell, Snooke, and White, the South Africans developed the world's first (and arguably greatest ever){{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} spin attack which specialised in [[googly]]. Greatest among the South African googly quartet was Schwarz, who inspired by English googly bowler [[Bernard Bosanquet (cricketer)|Bernard Bosanquet]], regarded as the inventor of the googly, developed into the most devastating googly bowler of his time. He taught diligently the secrets of the googly to allrounder Faulkner, medium-pacer Vogler and specialist batsman White, and together the four formed a quartet which began to lead South Africa to unprecedented heights in Test cricket.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Another important force during this period for South Africa were the all-round performances of Faulkner and Llewellyn. Faulkner came to be regarded as the first great South African all-rounders in the international game, regarded by some as even the greatest all-rounder in the world in the pre-1st World War period.<ref>[http://www.cricketcountry.com/articles/aubrey-faulkner-the-first-of-the-great-south-african-all-rounders-76039 Aubrey Faulkner: The first of the great South African all-rounders] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180909035413/https://www.cricketcountry.com/articles/aubrey-faulkner-the-first-of-the-great-south-african-all-rounders-76039 |date=9 September 2018 }} Cricket Country. 17 December 2015.

The side won ten out of their twenty-two matches, including a thrilling [[Result (cricket)#Tie|tie]] with [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]], who finished among the top four in that year's [[County Championship]], due to some magic weaved by Schwarz through his googlies. He repeated his heroics against an all-England XI, whom South Africa recorded an upset victory against by 189 runs. Unfortunately, the match was not accorded official Test status.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nIn 1906, England made a reciprocal [[English cricket team in South Africa in 1905\u201306|tour]] to South Africa, which this time consisted of a 5-match official Test series. The touring English team was second-string team, with only [[Colin Blythe]], [[Schofield Haigh]] and [[Jack Crawford (cricketer)|JN Crawford]] being those who could be considered regulars of the England team. Nevertheless, South Africa were still not favourites going into the series. However, in a shocking result at [[Johannesburg]], the inspired South Africans, led by Sherwell and their googly quartet, defeated England by 1 wicket, thereby recording her first Test win. Schwarz, Vogler and Faulkner led the way for South Africa.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Afterwards, South Africa defeated England by 9 wickets in the 2nd Test at Johannesburg, a 243-run win in the 3rd test at the same venue as well as an innings-and-16 runs victory at Cape Town in the 5th Test to secure a 4\u20131 domination of England. Schwarz picked up 18 in the series at 17.22, Faulkner 14 at 19.42.

By this time, the googly duo of Schwarz and White were past their prime, while Vogler had already retired. Additionally, retirements of key players such as Sherwell ensured that South Africa were no where near their best in the series. South Africa finished bottom with just one draw, but the series was notable for the debut of [[Herbie Taylor]], regarded as one of the finest batsmen of the era. The tournament marked the international swansong for Schwarz and White. The tournament also marked the peak of the short, but moderately successful test career of medium-pacer [[Sid Pegler]], whose rise, coinciding as it did with the decline of Schwarz and Vogler, briefly caused him to hold the mantle of the lead bowler of the South African bowling attack before as well as to emerge as South Africa's leading bowler and a resounding success in the Triangular tournament, before commitments elsewhere in the form of the appointment as a colonial district commissioner in [[Nyasaland]] forced him to drift out of cricket \u2013 meaning that the enormous potential that he showed in that Triangular as well as the expectations that he could be a mainstay in the South African bowling in the coming years were not quite fulfilled.\n\n[[File:Herbie Taylor 1924-04-29.jpg|thumb|[[Herbie Taylor]], whose career spanned 20 years and 42 Tests, was the first South African to reach the landmark of 2,500 Test [[Run (cricket)|runs]] at an average of 40.77. He was the mainstay of the South African batting as well as one of the leading batsmen in the world from his debut in 1912 until his retirement in 1932. He was an expert on the matting pitches which were prevalent in South Africa at the time and scored six of his seven centuries at home. His batting was also noted for quick footwork and exceptional 'backplay'.]]\n\nProdigious batsman Herbie Taylor was named captained of the South African team to face off against [[English cricket team in South Africa in 1913\u201314|the visiting English team]] in 1913\u201314, in what would prove South Africa's last international cricketing involvement before the First World War. Overall, the series was extremely poor for a South African side in transition, who failed to replicate the achievements of the South African sides 1905\u201306 and 1909\u201310, losing the 5-match Test series 4\u20130 against an extremely strong English side playing under the banner of the MCC. However, the series became memorable for Herbie Taylor's exceptional batting, who heralded his arrival as a new colossus in the world game, scoring a phenomenal 508 runs at an [[Batting average (cricket)|average]] of 50.80 against a terrific [[Sydney Barnes]] at his prime, who had claimed a record 49 wickets during the series [[Bowling average|at]] just 10.93. The cricket historian [[Harry Altham|H.S. Altham]] wrote: \"The English cricketers were unanimous that finer batting than his against Barnes at his best they never hoped to see.\" [[Neville Cardus]] noted it was \"perhaps the most skilful of all Test performances by a batsman.\" It also led Cardus to count Taylor as \"one of the six greatest batsmen of the post-Grace period\".\n\n===The inter-war years===\n{{main|History of cricket in South Africa from 1918\u201319 to 1945}}\nThe war brought in its wake the temporary suspension of international cricket.

Nourse, in particular, became famous for his hand-eye co-ordination and his excellent fielding, one of many to be produced by South Africa in the coming decades; natural skills which were according to legend inspired and developed by his father Dave's refusal to coach him as a youngster, demanding that he learnt the rudiments of the game on his own, as he himself had.

South Africa needed 22 runs from 13 balls when rain intervened. After the delay they were left in the situation of requiring 22 runs from one ball to progress. In 1996 they were eliminated in the quarter-finals despite being one of the fancied teams and having qualified first in their group.In 1999 South Africa lost in the semi-final to eventual champions Australia. The match ended in a tie both South Africa and Australia managing 213 but [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] advanced to the Final as Australia finished higher than South Africa in the group.\n\nSouth Africa hosted the [[2003 Cricket World Cup]], but failed to progress beyond the group stage due to a misunderstanding of how many runs they needed to score in a rain-affected run chase. As a result of this, [[Shaun Pollock]] resigned as captain and was replaced by young batsman [[Graeme Smith]], although Pollock continued to play for the team. Under Smith's leadership, South Africa has achieved some success, although they have been hampered by the retirements of many star players, including fast bowler [[Allan Donald]] and one-day specialist [[Jonty Rhodes]]. As a result, they had a poor 2004, only winning against the [[West Indies cricket team|Windies]].\n\nIn the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]] they had a rollercoaster ride that included dominant wins over [[England national cricket team|England]], the West Indies, [[Ireland national cricket team|Ireland]], [[Netherlands national cricket team|Netherlands]] and [[Scotland national cricket team|Scotland]], and a narrow win over [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]], but devastating losses to Australia, [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] and Bangladesh that cost them the No. 1 ranking. Then they bowed out in the semi-finals with their lowest ever score in a World Cup as Australia bowled them out for 149 and won by 7 wickets.\n\nIn the [[2011 Cricket World Cup|2011 World Cup]], South Africa topped Group B with the distinction of bowling out every side they played within the 50 over limit, which also included a famous victory over hosts India. In the quarter final they were beaten by New Zealand after suffering a dramatic collapse and losing eight wickets for 64 runs.\n\nEven after many setbacks, their biggest heartbreak was awaiting them in the [[2015 Cricket World Cup|2015 World cup]] semi-final where they lost to the tournament runners up New Zealand in a rain affected tie. Batting first South Africa posted 281\u20135 and set a revised target of 298 to New Zealand, thanks to an amazing batting performance by [[Faf du Plessis]], [[David Miller (South African cricketer)|David Miller]] and captain [[AB de Villiers]]. Chasing a mammoth target of 298 New Zealand got off to a flier inspired by their captain [[Brendon McCullum]]. But the real hero of the match was [[Grant Elliott]], who scored 84* including a second-last ball six off the then world's best bowler [[Dale Steyn]]. This saw South Africa crash out of the 2015 World Cup despite playing some fantastic cricket throughout the entire tournament. After a good world cup South Africa went on to dominate ODI cricket in bilateral series which saw the Proteas rise to No. 1 in the [[ICC ODI Championship]].\n\nAt the [[2019 Cricket World Cup]] South Africa lost the opening match of the tournament to England and followed this up with losses to Bangladesh and India. Rained out against West Indies, they defeated Afghanistan but then lost to New Zealand and Pakistan, to end their chances of qualifying for the next stage.\n\nThey also hold the record of the highest successful run chase and made the highest total (the latter record has been surpassed) in One-Day Internationals (438\u20139 in 49.5 overs), in [[Australia in South Africa, 5th ODI, 2006|an iconic match]] against [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] on 12 March 2006. This game is considered by many to be the greatest One-Day International ever played.\n\nSouth Africa beat Netherlands by 231 runs in [[Mohali]] in Group matches in [[ICC World Cup 2011]], The 231-run win is the fourth largest margin of victory for any team in World Cups and the largest for South Africa in World Cups. It is also the second largest margin of victory for South Africa in ODIs on 3 March 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=Netherlands vs South Africa, ICC World Cup 2011|url=http://iccworld-cup2011.blogspot.com/2011/03/south-africa-vs-netherlands-mohali-3rd.html|date=March 2011|publisher=iccworld-cup2011.blogspot.com|access-date=3 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708042825/http://iccworld-cup2011.blogspot.com/2011/03/south-africa-vs-netherlands-mohali-3rd.html|archive-date=8 July 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\nThe 87-run stand between [[JP Duminy]] and [[Colin Ingram (cricketer)|Colin Ingram]] is the highest for the sixth wicket for South Africa in World Cups. The highest sixth-wicket stand for South Africa in ODIs is the 137 between Hansie Cronje and Shaun Pollock against Zimbabwe in 1997.

South Africa fielders may wear a green cap or a white sun hat with the king protea badge in the middle. Helmets are also coloured green. Before 1996, the cap insignia was the [[Cricket South Africa|United Cricket Board of South Africa]] old badge, which was a circle with a ball superimposed over a wicket in the center and the inscription which reads \"UNITED CRICKET BOARD OF SOUTH AFRICA\" around the circle's border. Prior to 1991, the cap insignia was a spingbok head with under the inscription \"S.A.C.B\" in yellow letters (which changed to \"S.A.\" with the years of the tour, for instance \"S.A. 1982\u201383\").\n\nIn [[limited overs cricket]], South Africa's ODI and Twenty20 shirts feature the king protea badge with the national flag on the left of the shirt, Standard Bank on the right side and the New Balance logo on the right sleeve. \nIn ODIs, the kit comprises a green shirt with yellow accents and dark green stylised protea leaves and green trousers, whilst the Twenty20 kit comprises a green shirt with a yellow gradient and the [[Oxigen Services|Oxigen]] logo in the front and green trousers. In both uniforms, the fielding hat is a green baseball cap with white piping and a yellow line on the visor border or a green sunhat, which are both green with the king protea badge.\nIn [[International Cricket Council|ICC]] limited-overs tournaments, a modified kit design is used with sponsor's logos moving to the sleeve and 'South Africa' printed across the front.\n\nSince 2016, South Africa played some matches with an all-pink version of its uniform, in order to raise breast cancer awareness.\n\nPrevious suppliers were ISC (1992\u20131996), Asics (1999), Admiral (2000\u20132003), Hummel (2004\u20132007) and Adidas (2011\u20132015).\n\nUntil 2016, the sponsor was [[Castle Lager]].\n\n==Squad==\nThis is a list of every active player to have played for South Africa in the last year (since 17 February 2019), and the forms of the game in which they have played.
