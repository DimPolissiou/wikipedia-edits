The term is most commonly used to refer to the '''regular''' octahedron, a [[Platonic solid]] composed of eight [[equilateral triangle]]s, four of which meet at each [[wikt:vertex|vertex]]?\n\nA regular octahedron is the [[dual polyhedron]] of a [[cube]]. It is a [[Rectification (geometry)|rectified]] [[tetrahedron]]. It is a square [[bipyramid]] in any of three [[orthogonal]] orientations. It is also a triangular [[antiprism]] in any of four orientations.\n\nAn octahedron is the three-dimensional case of the more general concept of a [[cross polytope]].\n\nA regular octahedron is a [[n-ball|3-ball]] in the [[Taxicab geometry|Manhattan ({{math|''\u2113''}}{{sub|1}}) metric]].\n\n==Regular octahedron==\n\n===Dimensions===\nIf the edge length of a regular octahedron is ''a'', the [[radius]] of a circumscribed [[sphere]] (one that touches the octahedron at all vertices) is\n:<math>r_u = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} a \\approx 0.707 \\cdot a</math>\n\nand the radius of an inscribed sphere ([[tangent]] to each of the octahedron's faces) is\n:<math>r_i = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{6} a \\approx 0.408\\cdot a</math>\n\nwhile the midradius, which touches the middle of each edge, is\n:<math>r_m = \\tfrac{1}{2} a = 0.5\\cdot a</math>\n\n===Orthogonal projections===\nThe ''octahedron'' has four special [[orthogonal projection]]s, centered, on an edge, vertex, face, and normal to a face.

Correspondingly, a regular octahedron is the result of cutting off from a regular tetrahedron, four regular tetrahedra of half the linear size (i.e. [[Rectification (geometry)|rectifying]] the tetrahedron). The vertices of the octahedron lie at the midpoints of the edges of the tetrahedron, and in this sense it relates to the tetrahedron in the same way that the [[cuboctahedron]] and [[icosidodecahedron]] relate to the other Platonic solids. One can also divide the edges of an octahedron in the ratio of the [[golden ratio|golden mean]] to define the vertices of an [[icosahedron]]. This is done by first placing vectors along the octahedron's edges such that each face is bounded by a cycle, then similarly partitioning each edge into the golden mean along the direction of its vector. There are five octahedra that define any given icosahedron in this fashion, and together they define a ''regular compound''.\n\n[[Tetrahedral-octahedral honeycomb|Octahedra and tetrahedra]] can be alternated to form a vertex, edge, and face-uniform [[tessellation of space]], called the [[octet truss]] by [[Buckminster Fuller]].

Another is a tessellation of octahedra and [[cuboctahedra]].\n\nThe octahedron is unique among the Platonic solids in having an even number of faces meeting at each vertex. Consequently, it is the only member of that group to possess mirror planes that do not pass through any of the faces.\n\nUsing the standard nomenclature for [[Johnson solid]]s, an octahedron would be called a ''square bipyramid''. Truncation of two opposite vertices results in a [[square bifrustum]].\n\nThe octahedron is [[k-vertex-connected graph|4-connected]], meaning that it takes the removal of four vertices to disconnect the remaining vertices. It is one of only four 4-connected [[simplicial polytope|simplicial]] [[well-covered graph|well-covered]] polyhedra, meaning that all of the [[maximal independent set]]s of its vertices have the same size. The other three polyhedra with this property are the [[pentagonal dipyramid]], the [[snub disphenoid]], and an irregular polyhedron with 12 vertices and 20 triangular faces.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Finbow |first1=Arthur S. |last2=Hartnell |first2=Bert L. |last3=Nowakowski |first3=Richard J. |last4=Plummer |first4=Michael D. |author4-link=Michael D.

Consequently, it is the only member of that group to possess mirror planes that do not pass through any of the faces.\n\nUsing the standard nomenclature for [[Johnson solid]]s, an octahedron would be called a ''square bipyramid''. Truncation of two opposite vertices results in a [[square bifrustum]].\n\nThe octahedron is [[k-vertex-connected graph|4-connected]], meaning that it takes the removal of four vertices to disconnect the remaining vertices. It is one of only four 4-connected [[simplicial polytope|simplicial]] [[well-covered graph|well-covered]] polyhedra, meaning that all of the [[maximal independent set]]s of its vertices have the same size. The other three polyhedra with this property are the [[pentagonal dipyramid]], the [[snub disphenoid]], and an irregular polyhedron with 12 vertices and 20 triangular faces.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Finbow |first1=Arthur S. |last2=Hartnell |first2=Bert L. |last3=Nowakowski |first3=Richard J. |last4=Plummer |first4=Michael D. |author4-link=Michael D.

Most compellingly, however, the study of criminal subcultures seemed to show the existence of \u2018bad families\u2019 in which crime was almost hereditary.<ref name=jenkins/> As early as the 1860s, Morel had fully synthesized these theories to explain crime as a component of his detailed classification of \u2018degenerate\u2019 types. Behavioral traits such as crime, idiocy, epilepsy, alcoholism, and insanity were all likely to be found in \u2018degenerate\u2019 families.<ref name=jenkins/>\n\nSpecifically in the United States, Pennsylvania was one of the first areas to be influenced by the link between defective mental states and crime. [[Dorothea Dix]] led a campaign to remove insane convicts to a special asylum alluding that crime was a symptom of a mental condition of which insanity was all but an extreme manifestation.<ref name=jenkins/> Thus, in the early days of the eugenics movement, prison was intended to be filled only with offenders who could undergo rehabilitation, while alternate \u2018mental\u2019 institutions provided the necessary segregation to control and prevent the procreation of \u2018degenerate\u2019 racial types.<ref name=jenkins/> Because the eugenics movement found early support among the state\u2019s political and administrative elite, such Isaac N. Kerlin, who carried a public campaign for strict eugenic segregation as a means of preventing crime and social decay, many campaigns advocated and supported the \u2018eugenic solution\u2019 which ultimately manifested itself in eugenic institutions/centers such as [[Elwyn (company)|Elwyn]].<ref name=jenkins/>\n\nSome centers specifically targeted women in an effort to control and regulate a subsection of the female population that was defined as fertile, feeble-minded, female paupers and therefore officially recognized as dysgenic.<ref name=rafter>{{cite journal|last=Rafter|first=Nicole|title=Claims-Making and Socio-Cultural Context in the First U.S. Eugenics Campaign|journal=Social Problems|date=1992|volume=39|issue=1|pages=17\u201334|doi=10.2307/3096909|jstor=3096909}}<!--|accessdate=14 March 2014--></ref> This theoretical relationship manifested itself in early legislation that supported psychological asylums that aimed to indirectly criminalize not an action, but the female body itself.<ref name=rafter/>\n\n==Eugenics in prisons during the 20th Century==\nAs [[World War II]] came to a close in the 1945 the eugenics movement, which was founded on the idea that the improvement of human genetic traits would result in a more desirable population, quickly lost legitimacy in the scientific community. However, it was important to note that prior to the end of the war eugenics proved to be a major factor in motivating other (seemingly unconnected) reforms in health, welfare, housing, education, or [[penology]].<ref name=jenkins/> In order to appreciate the nature of reform in the Progressive Era, it is essential to understand the eugenics movement and how it quickly gained popularity - especially when the movement required extensive legislation and the building of institutions, such as prisons.<ref name=jenkins/> The science of [[eugenics]] appealed to conservatives because it proved a technocratic and modern-sounding framework to control the growing power of immigrants. Prior to this scientific theory, they had attempted to impose their cultural values on newcomers by the traditional 'symbolic crusades' of temperance and evangelism.<ref name=jenkins/> The changing political climate, however, rendered these methods archaic and eugenics gained popularity because it provided the ideological structure necessary to give scientific substance to traditional prejudices. In 1915, social and political elites were attempting to control lower-class newcomers through reforming and \u2018child saving\u2019 institutions backed by the science of eugenics which seemed more reasonable than religion.<ref name=jenkins/>\n\n==Eugenic prison themes in the media==\n\n===Sterilized Behind Bars===\n''[[Sterilized Behind Bars]]'' is a documentary about the forced sterilization of female prisoners. The film focuses on the State of California, where nearly 20,000 women are recorded to have experienced forced sterilization. The film shows the several personal experiences of female prisoners, showing how vulnerable a woman\u2019s body because she doesn\u2019t know better, \u2018I figured that it\u2019s just what happens in prison.\u2019<ref name=lohman>{{cite web|last=Lohman|first=Leila|title=Activist Documentary Tackles Eugenics in California Prisons: \"Sterilized Behind Bars\"|work=We Are Your Campaign Human Rights Consulting Group}}</ref> It touches on the notion of \u201cinformed consent\u201d when prisoners aren\u2019t given much of a choice from prison staff. Power is misused and refusal to comply is answered with retaliation. Now victims out of prisons are asking for monetary compensation from their respective states.

Behavioral traits such as crime, idiocy, epilepsy, alcoholism, and insanity were all likely to be found in \u2018degenerate\u2019 families.<ref name=jenkins/>\n\nSpecifically in the United States, Pennsylvania was one of the first areas to be influenced by the link between defective mental states and crime. [[Dorothea Dix]] led a campaign to remove insane convicts to a special asylum alluding that crime was a symptom of a mental condition of which insanity was all but an extreme manifestation.<ref name=jenkins/> Thus, in the early days of the eugenics movement, prison was intended to be filled only with offenders who could undergo rehabilitation, while alternate \u2018mental\u2019 institutions provided the necessary segregation to control and prevent the procreation of \u2018degenerate\u2019 racial types.<ref name=jenkins/> Because the eugenics movement found early support among the state\u2019s political and administrative elite, such Isaac N. Kerlin, who carried a public campaign for strict eugenic segregation as a means of preventing crime and social decay, many campaigns advocated and supported the \u2018eugenic solution\u2019 which ultimately manifested itself in eugenic institutions/centers such as [[Elwyn (company)|Elwyn]].<ref name=jenkins/>\n\nSome centers specifically targeted women in an effort to control and regulate a subsection of the female population that was defined as fertile, feeble-minded, female paupers and therefore officially recognized as dysgenic.<ref name=rafter>{{cite journal|last=Rafter|first=Nicole|title=Claims-Making and Socio-Cultural Context in the First U.S. Eugenics Campaign|journal=Social Problems|date=1992|volume=39|issue=1|pages=17\u201334|doi=10.2307/3096909|jstor=3096909}}<!--|accessdate=14 March 2014--></ref> This theoretical relationship manifested itself in early legislation that supported psychological asylums that aimed to indirectly criminalize not an action, but the female body itself.<ref name=rafter/>\n\n==Eugenics in prisons during the 20th Century==\nAs [[World War II]] came to a close in the 1945 the eugenics movement, which was founded on the idea that the improvement of human genetic traits would result in a more desirable population, quickly lost legitimacy in the scientific community. However, it was important to note that prior to the end of the war eugenics proved to be a major factor in motivating other (seemingly unconnected) reforms in health, welfare, housing, education, or penology.<ref name=jenkins/> In order to appreciate the nature of reform in the Progressive Era, it is essential to understand the eugenics movement and how it quickly gained popularity - especially when the movement required extensive legislation and the building of institutions, such as prisons.<ref name=jenkins/> The science of [[eugenics]] appealed to conservatives because it proved a technocratic and modern-sounding framework to control the growing power of immigrants. Prior to this scientific theory, they had attempted to impose their cultural values on newcomers by the traditional 'symbolic crusades' of temperance and evangelism.<ref name=jenkins/> The changing political climate, however, rendered these methods archaic and eugenics gained popularity because it provided the ideological structure necessary to give scientific substance to traditional prejudices. In 1915, social and political elites were attempting to control lower-class newcomers through reforming and \u2018child saving\u2019 institutions backed by the science of eugenics which seemed more reasonable than religion.<ref name=jenkins/>\n\n==Eugenic prison themes in the media==\n\n===Sterilized Behind Bars===\n''[[Sterilized Behind Bars]]'' is a documentary about the forced sterilization of female prisoners. The film focuses on the State of California, where nearly 20,000 women are recorded to have experienced forced sterilization. The film shows the several personal experiences of female prisoners, showing how vulnerable a woman\u2019s body because she doesn\u2019t know better, \u2018I figured that it\u2019s just what happens in prison.\u2019<ref name=lohman>{{cite web|last=Lohman|first=Leila|title=Activist Documentary Tackles Eugenics in California Prisons: \"Sterilized Behind Bars\"|work=We Are Your Campaign Human Rights Consulting Group}}</ref> It touches on the notion of \u201cinformed consent\u201d when prisoners aren\u2019t given much of a choice from prison staff. Power is misused and refusal to comply is answered with retaliation. Now victims out of prisons are asking for monetary compensation from their respective states.

{"title_page": "Polish Penal Code", "text_new": "'''''Kodeks Karny''''' is [[Poland]]'s criminal-law code. The name is often abbreviated ''KK''. \n\nModern Polish legal history has seen the introduction of three penal codes: in 1932; in 1969, during the [[Polish People's Republic|communist]] era; and in 1997. The last of those has been amended 49<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://prawo.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WDU19970880553 |title=Ustawa z dnia 6 czerwca 1997 r. - Kodeks karny. |website=prawo.sejm.gov.pl |access-date=2020-04-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190917035448/http://prawo.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WDU19970880553 |archive-date=2019-09-17 |url-status=live }}</ref>times.  \n\nThe Penal Code, with the Penal Procedure Code and the Fiscal Penal Code, together make up Poland's criminal justice system, often referred to as \"penal law\".\n\n==Historical background==\n===Situation after 1918===\nAfter [[World War I]] Poland regained its [[independence]]. One of the most important tasks of the new government was to unify the law inherited from the [[Partitions of Poland|three partitioners']] different legal systems. Hence, after the war there were five different legal systems in Poland. These were those of [[Germany]] in the West, of the [[Austrian Empire]] in the South, of the [[Russian Empire]] in the far East, of the former [[Congress Poland]] in the Center, and two tiny regions ([[Orava (region)|Orava]] and [[Spi\u0161]]) in the South with the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] common law.\n\n===Codification Commission and the code of 1932===\nIn 1919 the first Codification Commission was created. It was divided into two sections; the first was to create a project of a penal code, the other\u2014a civil code. The most prominent representative of the Penal Commission was professor [[Juliusz Makarewicz]].<ref>Juliusz Bardach, ''Historia Ustroju i Prawa Polskiego'', LexisNexis, Warsaw, PL 2005, p. 553</ref> Works finished in 1931, and the code was enacted by the [[Primary and secondary legislation|President's regulation]] on July 11, 1932. Often called the Code of Makarewicz, the code of 1932 is perceived by the Polish jurisprudence to be an exquisite example of the modern [[penology]]. It consisted of 295 articles in 42 chapters.<ref name=\"WDU19320600571\">{{Cite web |url=http://prawo.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WDU19320600571 |title=Rozporz\u0105dzenie Prezydenta Rzeczypospolitej z dnia 11 lipca 1932 r. - Kodeks karny. |website=prawo.sejm.gov.pl |access-date=2020-04-09}} Retrieved November 17, 2010</ref> The first 92 articles constituted the general part of the code, defining different terms, conditions, and penalties. The following 203 articles was a catalogue of felonies grouped in 26 chapters. Article 1 of the code defined the penal responsibility, stating that a person is a subject to punishment only when its conduct constituted a criminal offence at the time when it took place.<ref name=WDU19320600571/> This fundamental rule of the modern criminal law made the code a very up-to-date document. Professor [[Juliusz Bardach]] observed<ref>Juliusz Bardach, ''Historia Ustroju i Prawa Polskiego'', LexisNexis, Warsaw, PL 2005, p. 565</ref> that the Codification Commission, having followed three basic concepts, was able to create a fair example of penal legislation. These were the rule of subjectivism, the rule of humanitarianism, and the introduction of preventive measures.<ref>Katarzyna S\u00f3jka-Zieli\u0144ska, ''Historia Prawa'', WNPWN, Warszawa, PL 1995, p.309\u2013310</ref> Subjectivism meant that the penal responsibility depended upon the perpetrator's intent and anticipation. The rule of humanitarianism was expressed in a very deliberate sentencing. For instance, the capital punishment was foreseen for 5 crimes only, always with the alternative of incarceration. The introduction of preventive measures, criticized by many lawyers, meant that mentally ill people and recidivists could be separated from the society. In the late 1930s, when the Polish government became very authoritarian, these preventive measures were used against those who opposed the r\u00e9gime. This led to the creation of the [[Bereza Kartuska prison]], a very severe detention camp, also called a concentration camp.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.eioba.pl/a86034/bereza_kartuska_polski_sanacyjny_ob_z_koncentracyjny |title=BEREZA Kartuska - Polski Sanacyjny Ob\u00f3z Koncentracyjny |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818013410/http://www.eioba.pl/a86034/bereza_kartuska_polski_sanacyjny_ob_z_koncentracyjny |archive-date=2010-08-18}}</ref>\n\n===World War II and its aftermath===\nOn September 1, 1939 Poland was attacked by the [[Wehrmacht|Nazi army]]. On September 17, the [[Red Army]] invaded as well. Poland ceased to exist, and so did its penal law. The [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|Nazi occupation]] was very harsh for Polish society, and all [[History of the Jews in Poland|its Jewish members]] were put into [[ghetto]]es. Later, when [[Final Solution|Die Endl\u00f6sung]] policy was carried out, any help to the Jewish people was scourged, by and large to death. In the time of war the rule of ''nullum crimen sine lege'' went for nothing. After the [[World War II|war]] Poland became a communist state, with a totalitarian r\u00e9gime. Although the new government upheld the Penal Code of 1932, it was not an obstacle for putting political enemies to jails. Special national security acts issued in the late 1940s and early 1950s, allowed communist judges to sentence many people to death without a fair trial. Many people went missing. After the thaw of 1956, often called the [[Polish October]], this situation began to change.\n\n===The code of 1969===\nThe codification of the [[Private law|civil law]] was much more important for the communist r\u00e9gime than codifying the Penal Code.<ref>Katarzyna S\u00f3jka-Zieli\u0144ska, ''Historia Prawa'', WNPWN, Warszawa, PL 1995, p. 378</ref> After minor changes, the elastic Code of 1932 remained in force. Works on a new code began only after the communist r\u00e9gime ripened under [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]] in the 1960s. Chaired by [[Jerzy Sawicki]] and [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Wolter]], the Codification Commission put forward a project in 1963. However, it was refuted as too progressive.<ref name=\"kochanowski.pl\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.kochanowski.pl/rdukacja-wersja1.3.2000.doc |title=rdukacja-wersja1.3.2000 |url-status=dead |access-date=2010-11-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722103116/http://www.kochanowski.pl/rdukacja-wersja1.3.2000.doc |archive-date=2011-07-22 }}</ref> The next commission, moderated by prof. Andrejew, proposed a draft of the new code in 1968. Without much discussion, it was implemented the following year. Intended to protect the communist r\u00e9gime, the code of 1969 was very repressive and inhibitory.\n\n===The abolition of communism and the works on a new penal code===\nIn the late 1980s, when the r\u00e9gime was losing its powers, the Penal Law Reform Commission was formed. Its works sped up in [[1989 in Poland|1989]] when the communist r\u00e9gime collapsed and [[Tadeusz Mazowiecki]] became the prime minister. The Commission, influenced by its two most prominent figures, prof. [[Kazimierz Bucha\u0142a]] and prof. [[Andrzej Zoll]], proposed a very liberal draft, which constituted an anathema to the code of 1969.\n\n==The Penal Code of 1997==\n===Main Characteristics===\n===={{anchor|Structure}}Structure====\nThe code is divided into three parts. Bearing the name ''general'', the first part is a scaffolding for the whole code. It defines basic terms, types of sanctions and regulates all aspects of penal responsibility. It is composed of 15 chapters divided into 116 articles. The second part of the code is a catalogue of crimes, including penalties foreseen for each of them. It is made up by 200 articles (Art. 117 to Art 316) gathered into 22 chapters (Chapter XVI to Chapter XXXVII). The third part defines crimes that can be committed by active soldiers only. It is composed of 46 articles grouped into 7 chapters.\n\n====Mitigation of punishment====\nIn his paper ''The Commutation of Penal Liability'',<ref name=kochanowski.pl/> [[Janusz Kochanowski]] stated that the main characteristic of the new code was the commutation of penal liability on three different levels. In result, in comparison with the previous code, out of 314 types of crimes, in 131 cases the maximum imprisonment period was lowered, in 203 cases the minimum imprisonment period was lowered, in 50 cases both were lowered, and in 8 cases the capital punishment was repealed. For instance, the maximum punishment for espionage was lowered by 3 times, from 25 years to 8 years' imprisonment, and the minimum punishment was lowered by 10 times, from 5 years to 6 months' imprisonment.\n\n=====First-degree commutations=====\n* Lowering the minimum incarceration period from 3 to 1 month\n* Lowering the minimum restriction of freedom period from 3 to 1 month\n* Commuting the restriction of freedom punishment\n* Repealing the capital punishment and the sequestration of property\n* Repealing the compulsory deprivation of public rights\n* Limiting the catalogue of facultative deprivation of public rights\n* Repealing the compulsory ban on occupying specified posts and prohibition on exercising a profession\n* Limiting the possibility of making a sentence publicly known\n* Repealing compulsory fine imposition supplementary to incarceration\n* Repealing the possibility of fine imposition supplementary to 25 years and life imprisonment\n\n=====Second-degree commutations=====\n* Softening juvenile liability (13\u201317 years)\n* Softening adolescent liability (17\u201321 years)\n* Enabling extraordinary mitigation of punishment to an aider\n* Enabling extraordinary mitigation of punishment to a cooperator without individual features\n* Extending the use of the extraordinary mitigation of punishment\n* Extending the use of the renouncement of inflicting a punishment\n* Limiting the use of the extraordinary exacerbation of punishment\n* Extending the use of conditional discontinuance of penal proceedings\n* Extending the use of conditional stay of the carrying out of a sentence\n* Extending the use conditional release from serving the full sentence\n* Limiting the use of preventive measures\n* Shortening the period of prescription and erasion of the entry in the register of convictions\n\n=====Third-degree commutations=====\n* The directive of milder punishment or resigning from punishment\n* The rule of humanitarianism\n* The rule of limiting guilt\n\n===Sanctions===\nArticle 32 of the code is a catalogue of sanctions. These are:\n\n==== Fine ====\n: It can be a specific amount or an amount of day rates. The latter means that the court first decides how many day rates shall be paid (from 10 to 360), and then decides what the day rate of the offender is (from 10 to 2000 [[Polish z\u0142oty|PLN]]). Depending on the offender's income, fines vary from 100 PLN to 1 080 000 PLN, if not exacerbated, mitigated or for concurring crimes.\n\n==== Restriction of freedom ====\n: The main goal of this sanction was to introduce the community service punishment, but since offender's consent is needed, it is not often used. Restriction of freedom can last from 1 to 12 months. The convict cannot change their dwelling-place without a court's consent, is obliged to perform the imposed work (20 to 40 hours a month or 10 to 25% of earnings instead), and is obliged to inform proper institutions about carrying out the punishment.\n\n==== {{anchor|Imprisonment}}Imprisonment ====\n: The shortest imprisonment period is 1 month, the longest is 15 years. The conditional release from serving the full sentence is allowed after serving two thirds of the full sentence.\n\n==== {{anchor|25 years' imprisonment}}25 years' imprisonment ====\n: The code imposes this punishment for the most severe crimes. Also, since Article 54 Sec. 2, does not allow sentencing offenders younger than 18 years to life imprisonment, this is the highest possible punishment for them. The conditional release from serving the full sentence is allowed after 15 years.\n\n==== {{anchor|Life imprisonment}}Life imprisonment ====\n: This very oppressive punishment is reserved to the most severe crimes. It is highest penalty imposed in Poland since the abolition of the death penalty in 1989. The crimes to which it applies include such as commencing an offensive warfare (Art. 117), genocide (Art. 123), conspiracy against the state (Art. 127) or homicide (Art. 148). The conditional release from serving the full sentence is allowed after 25 years.\n\n===Trivia===\n====Homicide====\nThree different types of homicide are foreseen by articles 148, 149 and 150 of the Code. Article 148 Sec. 1 describes the penalty for the basic type of the crime. It is penalized by no less than 8 years of imprisonment, 25 years' imprisonment or life imprisonment. Sections 2 and 3 introduce a more strict sentencing in cases of particular cruelty, using firearms or explosives, taking hostages, raping, robbery, multiple victims or relapse. In these cases the minimal imprisonment period rises to 12 years. On the other hand, Section 4 foresees a commuted penalty in case of a homicide under emotional strain. Such a reason allows the court to sentence between 1 and 10 years of imprisonment.\n\nArticles 149 and 150 cover two very specific types of homicide. In both cases the penalty is fairly commuted. A homicide of a newborn by its mother is penalized with 3 months to 5 years' imprisonment. Similarly, euthantic homicide is penalized with 3 months to 5 years' imprisonment. In the latter case, in extraordinary conditions, the court may apply the extraordinary mitigation of punishment or even the renouncement of inflicting a punishment.\n\n==Future developments==\nDue to the great number of amendments to the code, it has lost its original lucidity. Therefore, some Polish lawyers petition for a completely new codes,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://prawo.gazetaprawna.pl/wywiady/107766,nowy-kodeks-karny-powinien-byc-dostosowany-do-realiow.html,2 |title=Nowy kodeks karny powinien by\u0107 dostosowany do reali\u00f3w |website=prawo.gazetaprawna.pl |access-date=2020-04-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180107175348/http://prawo.gazetaprawna.pl/wywiady/107766,nowy-kodeks-karny-powinien-byc-dostosowany-do-realiow.html,2 |archive-date=2018-01-07 |url-status=live }}</ref> both penal and penal procedure, coherent with the most recent regulations of the EU.\n\n==Further reading==\n*Gerhard O.W.

One of the most important tasks of the new government was to unify the law inherited from the [[Partitions of Poland|three partitioners']] different legal systems. Hence, after the war there were five different legal systems in Poland. These were those of [[Germany]] in the West, of the [[Austrian Empire]] in the South, of the [[Russian Empire]] in the far East, of the former [[Congress Poland]] in the Center, and two tiny regions ([[Orava (region)|Orava]] and [[Spi\u0161]]) in the South with the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] common law.\n\n===Codification Commission and the code of 1932===\nIn 1919 the first Codification Commission was created. It was divided into two sections; the first was to create a project of a penal code, the other\u2014a civil code. The most prominent representative of the Penal Commission was professor [[Juliusz Makarewicz]].<ref>Juliusz Bardach, ''Historia Ustroju i Prawa Polskiego'', LexisNexis, Warsaw, PL 2005, p. 553</ref> Works finished in 1931, and the code was enacted by the [[Primary and secondary legislation|President's regulation]] on July 11, 1932. Often called the Code of Makarewicz, the code of 1932 is perceived by the Polish jurisprudence to be an exquisite example of the modern penology. It consisted of 295 articles in 42 chapters.<ref name=\"WDU19320600571\">{{Cite web |url=http://prawo.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WDU19320600571 |title=Rozporz\u0105dzenie Prezydenta Rzeczypospolitej z dnia 11 lipca 1932 r. - Kodeks karny. |website=prawo.sejm.gov.pl |access-date=2020-04-09}} Retrieved November 17, 2010</ref> The first 92 articles constituted the general part of the code, defining different terms, conditions, and penalties. The following 203 articles was a catalogue of felonies grouped in 26 chapters. Article 1 of the code defined the penal responsibility, stating that a person is a subject to punishment only when its conduct constituted a criminal offence at the time when it took place.<ref name=WDU19320600571/> This fundamental rule of the modern criminal law made the code a very up-to-date document. Professor [[Juliusz Bardach]] observed<ref>Juliusz Bardach, ''Historia Ustroju i Prawa Polskiego'', LexisNexis, Warsaw, PL 2005, p. 565</ref> that the Codification Commission, having followed three basic concepts, was able to create a fair example of penal legislation. These were the rule of subjectivism, the rule of humanitarianism, and the introduction of preventive measures.<ref>Katarzyna S\u00f3jka-Zieli\u0144ska, ''Historia Prawa'', WNPWN, Warszawa, PL 1995, p.309\u2013310</ref> Subjectivism meant that the penal responsibility depended upon the perpetrator's intent and anticipation. The rule of humanitarianism was expressed in a very deliberate sentencing. For instance, the capital punishment was foreseen for 5 crimes only, always with the alternative of incarceration. The introduction of preventive measures, criticized by many lawyers, meant that mentally ill people and recidivists could be separated from the society. In the late 1930s, when the Polish government became very authoritarian, these preventive measures were used against those who opposed the r\u00e9gime. This led to the creation of the [[Bereza Kartuska prison]], a very severe detention camp, also called a concentration camp.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.eioba.pl/a86034/bereza_kartuska_polski_sanacyjny_ob_z_koncentracyjny |title=BEREZA Kartuska - Polski Sanacyjny Ob\u00f3z Koncentracyjny |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818013410/http://www.eioba.pl/a86034/bereza_kartuska_polski_sanacyjny_ob_z_koncentracyjny |archive-date=2010-08-18}}</ref>\n\n===World War II and its aftermath===\nOn September 1, 1939 Poland was attacked by the [[Wehrmacht|Nazi army]]. On September 17, the [[Red Army]] invaded as well. Poland ceased to exist, and so did its penal law. The [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|Nazi occupation]] was very harsh for Polish society, and all [[History of the Jews in Poland|its Jewish members]] were put into [[ghetto]]es. Later, when [[Final Solution|Die Endl\u00f6sung]] policy was carried out, any help to the Jewish people was scourged, by and large to death. In the time of war the rule of ''nullum crimen sine lege'' went for nothing. After the [[World War II|war]] Poland became a communist state, with a totalitarian r\u00e9gime. Although the new government upheld the Penal Code of 1932, it was not an obstacle for putting political enemies to jails. Special national security acts issued in the late 1940s and early 1950s, allowed communist judges to sentence many people to death without a fair trial. Many people went missing. After the thaw of 1956, often called the [[Polish October]], this situation began to change.\n\n===The code of 1969===\nThe codification of the [[Private law|civil law]] was much more important for the communist r\u00e9gime than codifying the Penal Code.<ref>Katarzyna S\u00f3jka-Zieli\u0144ska, ''Historia Prawa'', WNPWN, Warszawa, PL 1995, p. 378</ref> After minor changes, the elastic Code of 1932 remained in force. Works on a new code began only after the communist r\u00e9gime ripened under [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]] in the 1960s. Chaired by [[Jerzy Sawicki]] and [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Wolter]], the Codification Commission put forward a project in 1963. However, it was refuted as too progressive.<ref name=\"kochanowski.pl\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.kochanowski.pl/rdukacja-wersja1.3.2000.doc |title=rdukacja-wersja1.3.2000 |url-status=dead |access-date=2010-11-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722103116/http://www.kochanowski.pl/rdukacja-wersja1.3.2000.doc |archive-date=2011-07-22 }}</ref> The next commission, moderated by prof. Andrejew, proposed a draft of the new code in 1968. Without much discussion, it was implemented the following year. Intended to protect the communist r\u00e9gime, the code of 1969 was very repressive and inhibitory.\n\n===The abolition of communism and the works on a new penal code===\nIn the late 1980s, when the r\u00e9gime was losing its powers, the Penal Law Reform Commission was formed. Its works sped up in [[1989 in Poland|1989]] when the communist r\u00e9gime collapsed and [[Tadeusz Mazowiecki]] became the prime minister. The Commission, influenced by its two most prominent figures, prof. [[Kazimierz Bucha\u0142a]] and prof. [[Andrzej Zoll]], proposed a very liberal draft, which constituted an anathema to the code of 1969.\n\n==The Penal Code of 1997==\n===Main Characteristics===\n===={{anchor|Structure}}Structure====\nThe code is divided into three parts. Bearing the name ''general'', the first part is a scaffolding for the whole code. It defines basic terms, types of sanctions and regulates all aspects of penal responsibility. It is composed of 15 chapters divided into 116 articles. The second part of the code is a catalogue of crimes, including penalties foreseen for each of them. It is made up by 200 articles (Art. 117 to Art 316) gathered into 22 chapters (Chapter XVI to Chapter XXXVII). The third part defines crimes that can be committed by active soldiers only. It is composed of 46 articles grouped into 7 chapters.\n\n====Mitigation of punishment====\nIn his paper ''The Commutation of Penal Liability'',<ref name=kochanowski.pl/> [[Janusz Kochanowski]] stated that the main characteristic of the new code was the commutation of penal liability on three different levels. In result, in comparison with the previous code, out of 314 types of crimes, in 131 cases the maximum imprisonment period was lowered, in 203 cases the minimum imprisonment period was lowered, in 50 cases both were lowered, and in 8 cases the capital punishment was repealed.

Burger]] Professor of Constitutional Law and the Courts at [[New York University School of Law]], where he was a faculty member since 1982. He was a specialist in criminal law, criminal procedure, and criminal justice.\n\n==Personal==\nJacobs was born in [[Bronxville, New York]]. He and his brother Daniel (born 1952) grew up and attended public school in [[Mt. Vernon, New York]], where his father, Milton Jacobs, had a law practice.\n\nIn 1975, Jacobs met Jan Sweeney, a British-born academic accountant. They married in 1977. Their first child, Thomas, was born in 1978 and their second child, Sophi, was born in 1980. They have 4 young granddaughters (Rowan and Aurora Krause and Anna and Alma Jacobs). Jacobs lived in [[Greenwich Village]] and had a keen interest in classical music, opera, ballet, and modern dance. Until 2019, when he was diagnosed with ALS, he was an avid skier. Jacobs died on March 19, 2020.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.law.nyu.edu/news/in-memoriam-james-jacobs-criminal-law |title=In Memoriam: James Jacobs |website=NYU.edu |date=March 20, 2020 |accessdate=March 21, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Professional==\nJacobs earned his BA (1969) at [[Johns Hopkins University]], where he majored in sociology and minored in Russian. After completing military training (U.S. Army Reserves), he spent most of 1970 in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union as a [[Thomas J. Watson Fellow]].\n\nIn the fall of 1970, Jacobs began study at the [[University of Chicago Law School]]. During the summer of 1971, he served as a research assistant to the eminent criminal law professor [[Norval Morris]]. Professor Morris enjoyed a close relationship with the Illinois Director of Corrections, Peter Bensinger, and arranged for Jacobs to spend his 1972 summer doing research at [[Stateville Penitentiary]] in [[Joliet, Illinois]]. Jacobs\u2019 research, focusing on how several Chicago-based super gangs operated within the prison, resulted in \u201cStreet Gangs Behind Bars,\u201d published in the sociology journal ''Social Problems'' in 1973. This was the first scholarly article to deal with gangs in prison and launched Jacobs' career. \n\nAfter graduating magna cum laude from [[University of Chicago School of Law]] in June 1973, Jacobs became a full-time PhD student in the University of Chicago's Department of Sociology. The renowned sociologist [[Morris Janowitz]] was the chair of his PhD committee, which also included [[Norval Morris]], Barry Schwartz, and Edward Shils. Under Janowitz\u2019s guidance, Jacobs\u2019 prison research grew into a dissertation (PhD 1975) and a book, ''Stateville: The Penitentiary in Mass Society''<ref>Stateville: The Penitentiary in Mass Society, James B. Jacobs, University of Chicago Press, 1977, {{ISBN|978-0226389776}}</ref>, now regarded as a classic in American [[penology]].\n\nIn the fall of 1975, Jacobs became an assistant professor of law and sociology at [[Cornell University]]. He received tenure in both departments in 1980, but subsequently switched his appointment full-time into the law school, where he taught criminal law. During these years, Jacobs wrote ''Guard Unions and the Future of the Prisons'' (Institute of Public Employment, New York State School of Industrial and Labor Relations, 1978), ''Individual Rights and Institutional Authority: Cases and Materials'' (Bobbs-Merrill Co., 1979), and began work on ''New Perspectives on Prisons and Imprisonment'' (Cornell University Press, 1983).\n\nJacobs served as a visiting professor of law at [[New York University School of Law]] for the 1981-82 academic year. He arrived at NYU the same day as [[John Sexton]], who later became the law school\u2019s dean and NYU\u2019s president, and with whom Jacobs has shared a close and lasting friendship. At the end of that academic year, Jacobs resigned from [[Cornell University]] to become professor of law at NYU and director of the law school\u2019s Center for Research in Crime and Justice. Jacobs has been a member of the [[NYU Law]] faculty ever since, regularly teaching criminal law, criminal procedure, and such other courses as federal criminal law, juvenile justice, and specialty criminal justice area seminars on such topics as drunk driving, gun control, corruption and corruption control, prison law and policy, labor racketeering and organized crime control, the drug war, vice crimes, sentencing, privatization of criminal justice, criminal records policy and jurisprudence, cyber crime, and asset forfeiture and money laundering. Jacobs has co-taught seminars at NYU Law with David Garland, Ron Goldstock, Robert Stewart, Norval Morris, Jerome Cohen, Ronald K. Noble, Sharon Levin, Chester Mirsky, Joseph Viteritti, Anne Milgram, Judith Germano, Thomas Wiegand, John Gleeson, and Peter Kougasian. As a champion of the law school\u2019s criminal law program, Jacobs has been instrumental in recruiting to the law school some of its most distinguished faculty members, including David Garland, Stephen Schulhofer, Rachel Barkow, Erin Murphy, and Jerome Skolnick, who became co-director of the Center for the Research in Crime and Justice upon joining the NYU Law faculty in 1997.\n\nJacobs has also, over the years, undertaken research collaborations with dozens of students of the law school and fellows of the Center for Research in Crime and Justice, including co-authoring books with Frank Anechiarico, Kimberly Potter, Coleen Friel, Robert Raddick, Christopher Panarella, Jay Worthington, Kerry Cooperman, and Zoe Fuhr, as well as co-authoring scores of scholarly articles. And he has maintained strong ties with criminologists and other scholars from around the world, including Cyrille Fijnaut (Netherlands), Elena Larrauri (Spain), Xiuimei Wang (China), Dirk van Zyl Smit (South Africa and UK), and Henner Hess (Germany). \n\nWith the support and encouragement of NYU alumnus, [[Alan Fortunoff]], Jacobs launched the law school\u2019s monthly Fortunoff Criminal Justice Colloquium in 1983. Fifteen years later, when Fortunoff died, the distinguished criminal defense lawyer, [[Jack Hoffinger]], became the colloquium's benefactor. The multidisciplinary Criminal Justice Colloquium meets each month during the academic year. It features a public lecture by a leading criminal justice or criminology scholar, followed by questions and discussion. The Hoffinger Colloquium serves as a magnet for criminal justice professors, researchers, policymakers, and practitioners from the metropolitan area and beyond. With Ron Goldstock\u2019s support, Jacobs also established the law school\u2019s weekly criminal law faculty seminar, which has furthered community-building among NYU Law\u2019s diverse full-time and adjunct criminal law faculty, criminal law fellows, and visiting researchers.\n\nIn 1995, Jacobs served as [[Fulbright]] teaching fellow at the [[University of Cape Town South Africa]]. In 1988, Jacobs was visiting professor of law at [[Columbia University]]. In 1998, then dean (and later NYU president) [[John Sexton]] awarded Jacobs the [[Warren E. Burger Chair of Constitutional Law and the Courts]].\n\nSince 2000, Jacobs has been a fellow of the [[American Society of Criminology]]. He served for many years as chair of the advisory board of [[NYU Press]]. For many years, he also served on the advisory board of the [[NYC Criminal Justice Agency]]. In 2010, [[Attorney General Holder]] appointed Jacobs to the [[National Institute of Corrections]]\u2019 advisory board; Holder renewed the appointment in 2011. \n\nIn 2012, the [[International Association for the Study of Organized Crime]] awarded Jacobs its lifetime achievement award. In 2012, the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation]] named Jacobs a 2012\u20132013 fellow. On October 3, 2019, his colleagues honored him with a gala tribute celebrating his scholarship and his community-building at the law school. Speakers included U.S. and foreign scholars.\n\n==Publications==\nJacobs is the author, or co-author, of seventeen books. In 1989, he published ''Drunk Driving: An American Dilemma''<ref>Drunk Driving: An American Dilemma, James B. Jacobs, University of Chicago Press, 1992, {{ISBN|978-0226389790}}</ref>, a wide-ranging jurisprudential and policy analysis of drunk driving as a social phenomenon, criminal offense and target of socio-legal control. He also took up a multi-year consulting position with the [[New York State Organized Crime Task Force]] (OCTF), whose director was [[Ronald Goldstock]]. Jacobs worked with the OCTF on a study and investigation of [[Cosa Nostra]] penetration of the NYC construction industry. The study was published in 1990 as ''Corruption and Racketeering In The New York City Construction Industry: The Final Report of the New York State Organized Crime Task Force''<ref>Corruption and Racketeering In The New York City Construction Industry: The Final Report of the New York State Organized Task Force, Ronald Goldstock, Martin Marcus, Thomas D.

It was the first of five books that Jacobs was to write over the next twenty years on various aspects of the government's legal attack on the [[Cosa Nostra]]. Jacobs\u2019 collaboration with OCTF also brought him in touch with [[Hamilton College]]\u2019s public administration scholar, Frank Anechiarico, with whom Jacobs published a pathbreaking book on corruption and corruption control, ''The Pursuit of Absolute Integrity: How Corruption Control Makes Government Ineffective'' (University of Chicago Press, 1996).\n\nJacobs has also written books on political corruption, hate crime, gun control, and criminal records.

Burger]] Professor of Constitutional Law and the Courts at [[New York University School of Law]], where he was a faculty member since 1982. He was a specialist in criminal law, criminal procedure, and criminal justice.\n\n==Personal==\nJacobs was born in [[Bronxville, New York]]. He and his brother Daniel (born 1952) grew up and attended public school in [[Mt. Vernon, New York]], where his father, Milton Jacobs, had a law practice.\n\nIn 1975, Jacobs met Jan Sweeney, a British-born academic accountant. They married in 1977. Their first child, Thomas, was born in 1978 and their second child, Sophi, was born in 1980. They have 4 young granddaughters (Rowan and Aurora Krause and Anna and Alma Jacobs). Jacobs lived in [[Greenwich Village]] and had a keen interest in classical music, opera, ballet, and modern dance. Until 2019, when he was diagnosed with ALS, he was an avid skier. Jacobs died on March 19, 2020.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.law.nyu.edu/news/in-memoriam-james-jacobs-criminal-law |title=In Memoriam: James Jacobs |website=NYU.edu |date=March 20, 2020 |accessdate=March 21, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Professional==\nJacobs earned his BA (1969) at [[Johns Hopkins University]], where he majored in sociology and minored in Russian. After completing military training (U.S. Army Reserves), he spent most of 1970 in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union as a [[Thomas J. Watson Fellow]].\n\nIn the fall of 1970, Jacobs began study at the [[University of Chicago Law School]]. During the summer of 1971, he served as a research assistant to the eminent criminal law professor [[Norval Morris]]. Professor Morris enjoyed a close relationship with the Illinois Director of Corrections, Peter Bensinger, and arranged for Jacobs to spend his 1972 summer doing research at [[Stateville Penitentiary]] in [[Joliet, Illinois]]. Jacobs\u2019 research, focusing on how several Chicago-based super gangs operated within the prison, resulted in \u201cStreet Gangs Behind Bars,\u201d published in the sociology journal ''Social Problems'' in 1973. This was the first scholarly article to deal with gangs in prison and launched Jacobs' career. \n\nAfter graduating magna cum laude from [[University of Chicago School of Law]] in June 1973, Jacobs became a full-time PhD student in the University of Chicago's Department of Sociology. The renowned sociologist [[Morris Janowitz]] was the chair of his PhD committee, which also included [[Norval Morris]], Barry Schwartz, and Edward Shils. Under Janowitz\u2019s guidance, Jacobs\u2019 prison research grew into a dissertation (PhD 1975) and a book, ''Stateville: The Penitentiary in Mass Society''<ref>Stateville: The Penitentiary in Mass Society, James B. Jacobs, University of Chicago Press, 1977, {{ISBN|978-0226389776}}</ref>, now regarded as a classic in American penology.\n\nIn the fall of 1975, Jacobs became an assistant professor of law and sociology at [[Cornell University]]. He received tenure in both departments in 1980, but subsequently switched his appointment full-time into the law school, where he taught criminal law. During these years, Jacobs wrote ''Guard Unions and the Future of the Prisons'' (Institute of Public Employment, New York State School of Industrial and Labor Relations, 1978), ''Individual Rights and Institutional Authority: Cases and Materials'' (Bobbs-Merrill Co., 1979), and began work on ''New Perspectives on Prisons and Imprisonment'' (Cornell University Press, 1983).\n\nJacobs served as a visiting professor of law at [[New York University School of Law]] for the 1981-82 academic year. He arrived at NYU the same day as [[John Sexton]], who later became the law school\u2019s dean and NYU\u2019s president, and with whom Jacobs has shared a close and lasting friendship. At the end of that academic year, Jacobs resigned from [[Cornell University]] to become professor of law at NYU and director of the law school\u2019s Center for Research in Crime and Justice. Jacobs has been a member of the [[NYU Law]] faculty ever since, regularly teaching criminal law, criminal procedure, and such other courses as federal criminal law, juvenile justice, and specialty criminal justice area seminars on such topics as drunk driving, gun control, corruption and corruption control, prison law and policy, labor racketeering and organized crime control, the drug war, vice crimes, sentencing, privatization of criminal justice, criminal records policy and jurisprudence, cyber crime, and asset forfeiture and money laundering. Jacobs has co-taught seminars at NYU Law with David Garland, Ron Goldstock, Robert Stewart, Norval Morris, Jerome Cohen, Ronald K. Noble, Sharon Levin, Chester Mirsky, Joseph Viteritti, Anne Milgram, Judith Germano, Thomas Wiegand, John Gleeson, and Peter Kougasian.

Neil, 1972, {{ISBN|0-85587-037-0}}</ref>  Further plans included the idea to use prison labour for the construction, with a prison established specifically for that purpose.  In 1877 work on the gaol commenced and in 1886 it was proclaimed a prison and inmates moved there.\n\nThe breakwater they worked on was to extend some 1500 metres out into the bay, built from granite blocks quarried from the nearby hill.  Heavy gales caused damage to the structure as it progressed over the years.  In 1898 and 1899 new wings were built on the prison, suggesting work was intending to continue, but in 1903 it was abandoned.  Apparently the prison was costly to run and didn't fit with ideas of [[penology]] of the time.\n\nAbout 300 metres of breakwater had been built, and it had shoaled up the bay considerably.  A wharf had been built inside the breakwater in 1898, not meant for public use, but which ended up used regularly by passenger ships which could not navigate the [[Macleay River]] mouth.  Today only a small section of the breakwater remains, about 50 metres, and nothing of the wharf.\n\nIn 1915 the gaol was reopened to hold German wartime internees.  Most were single men of some education and included officers of the German Army Reserve.  A rumour went around in 1917 that a German landing party planned to free the men and when a German raider the [[SMS Wolf (auxiliary cruiser)|SS ''Wolf'']] was seen in 1918 the men were moved to the large camp at [[Holsworthy, New South Wales|Holsworthy]] outside [[Sydney]].\n\nThis was the last use made of the prison and it was stripped and fixtures sold off in 1922.

Neil, 1972, {{ISBN|0-85587-037-0}}</ref>  Further plans included the idea to use prison labour for the construction, with a prison established specifically for that purpose.  In 1877 work on the gaol commenced and in 1886 it was proclaimed a prison and inmates moved there.\n\nThe breakwater they worked on was to extend some 1500 metres out into the bay, built from granite blocks quarried from the nearby hill.  Heavy gales caused damage to the structure as it progressed over the years.  In 1898 and 1899 new wings were built on the prison, suggesting work was intending to continue, but in 1903 it was abandoned.  Apparently the prison was costly to run and didn't fit with ideas of penology of the time.\n\nAbout 300 metres of breakwater had been built, and it had shoaled up the bay considerably.  A wharf had been built inside the breakwater in 1898, not meant for public use, but which ended up used regularly by passenger ships which could not navigate the [[Macleay River]] mouth.  Today only a small section of the breakwater remains, about 50 metres, and nothing of the wharf.\n\nIn 1915 the gaol was reopened to hold German wartime internees.  Most were single men of some education and included officers of the German Army Reserve.  A rumour went around in 1917 that a German landing party planned to free the men and when a German raider the [[SMS Wolf (auxiliary cruiser)|SS ''Wolf'']] was seen in 1918 the men were moved to the large camp at [[Holsworthy, New South Wales|Holsworthy]] outside [[Sydney]].\n\nThis was the last use made of the prison and it was stripped and fixtures sold off in 1922.

This work also marks the turning point in Arabic astronomy. Hitherto, Arabic astronomers had adopted a primarily research approach to the field, translating works of others and learning already discovered knowledge.

In his work, he indicated the so-called \"[[equant]]\" problem of the [[Geocentric model|Ptolemic model]]. Al-Juzjani even proposed a solution for the problem. In [[al-Andalus]], the anonymous work ''al-Istidrak ala Batlamyus'' (meaning \"Recapitulation regarding Ptolemy\"), included a list of objections to the Ptolemic astronomy.\n\nOne of the most important works in the period was ''Al-Shuku ala Batlamyus'' (\"''Doubts on Ptolemy''\").

However, he complicates his theory by retaining Plato's perfect circular orbits of the planets.\n\n== 1572 ==\nA brilliant supernova ([[SN 1572]] - thought, at the time, to be a comet) is observed by [[Tycho Brahe]], who proves that it is traveling beyond Earth's atmosphere and therefore provides the first evidence that the heavens can change.\n\n== 1608 ==\nDutch eyeglass maker [[Hans Lippershey]] tries to patent a [[refracting telescope]] (the first historical record of one). The invention spreads rapidly across Europe, as scientists make their own instruments. Their discoveries begin a revolution in astronomy.\n\n== 1609 ==\n[[Johannes Kepler]] publishes his ''[[Astronomia nova|New Astronomy]]''. In this and later works, he announces his [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|three laws of planetary motion]], replacing the circular orbits of Plato with [[Ellipse|elliptical]] ones. [[Almanac]]s based on his laws prove to be highly accurate.\n\n== 1610 ==\n[[Galileo Galilei]] publishes ''[[Sidereus Nuncius]]'' describing the findings of his observations with the telescope he built. These include spots on the Sun, craters on the Moon, and four satellites of Jupiter. Proving that not everything orbits Earth, he promotes the Copernican view of a Sun-centered universe.\n\n== 1655 ==\nAs the power and the quality of the telescopes increase, [[Christiaan Huygens]] studies Saturn and discovers its largest satellite, Titan. He also explains Saturn's appearance, suggesting the planet is surrounded by a thin ring.\n\n== 1663 ==\nScottish astronomer [[James Gregory (mathematician)|James Gregory]] describes his \"[[Gregorian telescope|gregorian]]\" [[reflecting telescope]], using [[Parabolic reflector|parabolic mirrors]] instead of lenses to reduce [[chromatic aberration]] and [[spherical aberration]], but is unable to build one.\n\n== 1668 ==\nIsaac Newton builds the first [[reflecting telescope]], his [[Newtonian telescope]].\n\n== 1687 ==\n[[Isaac Newton]] publishes his first copy of the book ''Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica'', establishing the theory of gravitation and laws of motion. The ''Principia'' explains Kepler's laws of planetary motion and allows astronomers to understand the forces acting between the Sun, the planets, and their moons.\n\n== 1705 ==\n[[Edmond Halley]] calculates that the comets recorded at 76-year intervals from 1456 to 1682 are one and the same. He predicts that the comet will return again in 1758. When it reappears as expected, the comet is named in his honor.\n\n== 1750 ==\nFrench astronomer [[Nicolas de Lacaille]] sails to southern oceans and begins work compiling a catalog of more than 10000 stars in the southern sky. Although Halley and others have observed from the Southern Hemisphere before, Lacaille's star catalog is the first comprehensive one of the southern sky.\n\n== 1781 ==\nAmateur astronomer [[William Herschel]] discovers the planet Uranus, although he at first mistakes it for a comet. Uranus is the first planet to be discovered beyond Saturn, which was thought to be the most distant planet in ancient times.\n\n== 1784 ==\n[[Charles Messier]] publishes his catalog of star clusters and nebulas. Messier draws up the list to prevent these objects from being identified as comets. However, it soon becomes a standard reference for the study of star clusters and nebulars and is still in use today.\n\n== 1800 ==\nWilliam Herschel splits sunlight through a prism and with a thermometer, measures the energy given out by different colours. He notices a sudden increase in energy beyond the red end of the [[spectrum]], discovering invisible infrared and laying the foundations of spectroscopy.\n\n== 1801 ==\nItalian astronomer [[Giuseppe Piazzi]] discovers what appears to be a new planet orbiting between Mars and Jupiter, and names it [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]]. [[William Herschel]] proves it is a very small object, calculating it to be only 320&nbsp;km in diameter, and not a planet. He proposes the name asteroid, and soon other similar bodies are being found. We now know that Ceres is 932&nbsp;km in diameter, and is now considered to be a dwarf planet.\n\n== 1814 ==\n[[Joseph von Fraunhofer]] builds the first accurate spectrometer and uses it to study the spectrum of the Sun's light. He discovers and maps hundreds of fine dark lines crossing the solar spectrum. In 1859 these lines are linked to chemical elements in the Sun's atmosphere. Spectroscopy becomes a method for studying what stars are made of.\n\n== 1838 ==\n[[Friedrich Bessel]] successfully uses the method of stellar parallax, the effect of Earth's annual movement around the Sun, to calculate the distance to [[61 Cygni]], the first star other than the Sun to have its distance from Earth measured. Bessel's is a truly accurate measurement of stellar positions, and the parallax technique establishes a framework for measuring the scale of the universe.\n\n== 1843 ==\nGerman amateur astronomer [[Heinrich Schwabe]], who has been studying the [[Sun]] for the past 17 years, announces his discovery of a regular cycle in sunspot numbers - the first clue to the Sun's internal structure.\n\n== 1845 ==\nIrish astronomer [[William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse]] completes the first of the world's [[Leviathan of Parsonstown|great telescopes]], with a 180-cm mirror. He uses it to study and draw the structure of nebulas, and within a few months discovers the spiral structure of the [[Whirlpool Galaxy]].\n\nFrench physicists [[Jean Foucault]] and [[Armand Fizeau]] take the first detailed photographs of the Sun's surface through a telescope - the birth of scientific astrophotography. Within five years, astronomers produce the first detailed photographs of the Moon. Early film is not sensitive enough to image stars.\n\n== 1846 ==\nA new planet, [[Neptune]], is identified by German astronomer [[Johann Gottfried Galle]] while searching in the position suggested by [[Urbain Le Verrier]]. Le Verrier has calculated the position and size of the planet from the effects of its gravitational pull on the orbit of Uranus. An English mathematician, [[John Couch Adams]], also made a similar calculation a year earlier.\n\n== 1868 ==\nAstronomers notice a new bright emission line in the spectrum of the Sun's atmosphere during an eclipse. The emission line is caused by an element's giving out light, and British astronomer [[Norman Lockyer]] concludes that it is an element unknown on Earth. He calls it [[helium]], from the Greek word for the Sun. Nearly 30 years later, helium is found on Earth.\n\n== 1872 ==\nAn American astronomer [[Henry Draper]] takes the first photograph of the spectrum of a star (Vega), showing absorption lines that reveal its chemical makeup. Astronomers begin to see that spectroscopy is the key to understanding how stars evolve. [[William Huggins]] uses absorption lines to measure the redshifts of stars, which give the first indication of how fast stars are moving.\n\n== 1895 ==\n[[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]] publishes his first article on the possibility of space flight. His greatest discovery is that a rocket, unlike other forms of propulsion, will work in a vacuum. He also outlines the principle of a multistage launch vehicle.\n\n== 1901 ==\nA comprehensive survey of stars, the ''[[Henry Draper Catalogue]]'', is published. In the catalog, [[Annie Jump Cannon]] proposes a sequence of classifying stars by the absorption lines in their spectra, which is still in use today.\n\n== 1906 ==\n[[Ejnar Hertzsprung]] establishes the standard for measuring the true brightness of a star. He shows that there is a relationship between color and absolute magnitude for 90% of the stars in the Milky Way Galaxy. In 1913, [[Henry Norris Russell]] publishes a diagram that shows this relationship. Although astronomers agree that the diagram shows the sequence in which stars evolve, they argue about which way the sequence progresses. [[Arthur Eddington]] finally settles the controversy in 1924.\n\n== 1910 ==\n[[Williamina Fleming]] publishes her discovery of [[white dwarf]] stars.\n\n==1912==\n[[Henrietta Swan Leavitt]] discovers the [[period-luminosity relation]] for [[Cepheid variable]]s, whereas the brightness of a star is proportional to its luminosity oscillation period. It opened a whole new branch of possibilities of measuring distances on the universe, and this discovery was the basis for the work done by [[Edwin Hubble]] on extragalactic astronomy.\n\n== 1916 ==\nGerman physicist [[Karl Schwarzschild]] uses [[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of general relativity to lay the groundwork for black hole theory. He suggests that if any star collapse to a certain size or smaller, its gravity will be so strong that no form of radiation will escape from it.\n\n== 1923 ==\n[[Edwin Hubble]] discovers a [[Cepheid variable]] star in the \"Andromeda Nebula\" and proves that Andromeda and other nebulas are galaxies far beyond our own. By 1925, he produces a classification system for galaxies.\n\n== 1925 ==\n[[Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin]] discovers that [[hydrogen]] is the most abundant element in the Sun's atmosphere, and accordingly, the most abundant element in the universe by relating the spectral classes of stars to their actual temperatures and by applying the ionization theory developed by Indian physicist [[Meghnad Saha]]. This opens the path for the study of stellar atmospheres and chemical abundances, contributing to understand the chemical evolution of the universe.\n\n== 1926 ==\n[[Robert Goddard]] launches the first rocket powered by liquid fuel. He also demonstrates that a rocket can work in a vacuum. His later rockets break the sound barrier for the first time.\n\n== 1929 ==\n[[Edwin Hubble]] discovered that the universe is expanding and that the farther away a galaxy is, the faster it is moving away from us. Two years later, [[Georges Lema\u00eetre]] suggests that the expansion can be traced to an initial \"Big Bang\".\n\n== 1930 ==\nBy applying new ideas from subatomic physics, [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]] predicts that the atoms in a white dwarf star of more than 1.44 solar masses will disintegrate, causing the star to collapse violently. In 1933, [[Walter Baade]] and [[Fritz Zwicky]] describe the neutron star that results from this collapse, causing a supernova explosion.\n\n[[Clyde Tombaugh]] discovers the dwarf planet [[Pluto]] at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. The object is so faint and moving so slowly that he has to compare photos taken several nights apart.\n\n== 1932 ==\n[[Karl Jansky]] detects the first radio waves coming from space. In 1942, radio waves from the Sun are detected. Seven years later radio astronomers identify the first distant source - the Crab Nebula, and the galaxies Centaurus A and M87.\n\n== 1938 ==\nGerman physicist [[Hans Bethe]] explains how stars generate energy. He outlines a series of nuclear fusion reactions that turn hydrogen into helium and release enormous amounts of energy in a star's core. These reactions use the star's hydrogen very slowly, allowing it to burn for billions of years.\n\n== 1944 ==\nA team of German scientists led by [[Wernher von Braun]] develops the [[V-2]], the first rocket-powered ballistic missile. Scientists and engineers from Braun's team were captured at the end of [[World War II]] and drafted into the American and Russian rocket programs.\n\n== 1948 ==\nThe largest telescope in the world, with a 5.08m (200&nbsp;in) mirror, is completed at Palomar Mountain in California. At the time, the telescope pushes single-mirror telescope technology to its limits - large mirrors tend to bend under their own weight.\n\n== 1957 ==\nRussia launches the first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, into orbit, beginning the space age. The US launches its first satellite, Explorer 1, four months later.\n\n== 1958 ==\nJuly 29 marks the beginning of the [[NASA]] (National Aeronautics and Space Administration), agency newly created by the United States to catch up with Soviet space technologies. It absorbs all research centers and staffs of the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics|NACA]] (National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics), an organization founded in 1915.\n\n== 1959 ==\nRussia and the US both launch probes to the Moon, but NASA's Pioneer probes all failed. The Russian Luna program was more successful. Luna 2 crash-lands on the Moon's surface in September, and Luna 3 returns the first pictures of the Moon's farside in October.\n\n== 1960 ==\n[[Cornell University]] astronomer [[Frank Drake]] performed the first modern [[SETI]] experiment, named \"[[Project Ozma]]\", after the [[Princess Ozma|Queen of Oz]] in [[L. Frank Baum]]'s fantasy books.<ref>\"Science: Project Ozma,\" [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,874057,00.html ''Time,'' April 18, 1960] (web version accessed 17 October 2017)</ref>\n\n== 1961 ==\nRussia takes the lead in the space race as [[Yuri Gagarin]] becomes the first person to orbit Earth in April. NASA astronaut [[Alan Shepard]] becomes the first American in space a month later, but does not go into orbit, although he is the first person to land with himself still inside his spacecraft thus technically achieving the first complete human spaceflight by [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale|FAI]] definitions.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Geek Trivia: A leap of fakes|url = http://www.techrepublic.com/article/geek-trivia-a-leap-of-fakes|accessdate = 18 August 2016}}</ref> [[John Glenn]] achieves orbit in early 1962.\n\n== 1962 ==\nMariner 2 becomes the first probe to reach another planet, flying past Venus in December. NASA follows this with the successful Mariner 4 mission to Mars in 1965, both the US and Russia send many more probes to planets through the rest of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n== 1963 ==\nDutch-American astronomer [[Maarten Schmidt]] measures the spectra of quasars, the mysterious star-like radio sources discovered in 1960. He establishes that quasars are active galaxies, and among the most distant objects in the universe.\n\n== 1965 ==\n[[Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson|Robert Wilson]] announce the discovery of a weak radio signal coming from all parts of the sky. Scientists figure out that this must be emitted by an object at a temperature of -270&nbsp;\u00b0C. Soon it is recognized as the remnant of the very hot radiation from the Big Bang that created the universe 13 billion years ago, see [[Cosmic microwave background]]. This radio signal is emitted by the electron in hydrogen flipping from pointing up or down and is approximated to happen once in a million years for every particle. Hydrogen is present in interstellar space gas throughout the entire universe and most dense in nebulae which is where the signals originate. Even though the electron of hydrogen only flips once every million years the mere quantity of hydrogen in space gas makes the presence of these radio waves prominent.\n\n== 1966 ==\nRussian [[Luna 9]] probe makes the first successful soft landing on the Moon in January, while the US lands the far more complex Surveyor missions, which follows up to NASA's Ranger series of crash-landers, scout sites for possible manned landings.\n\n== 1967 ==\n[[Jocelyn Bell Burnell]] and [[Antony Hewish]] detected the first pulsar, an object emitting regular pulses of radio waves. Pulsars are eventually recognized as rapidly spinning neutron stars with intense magnetic fields - the remains of a supernova explosion.\n\n== 1968 ==\nNASA's [[Apollo 8]] mission becomes the first human spaceflight mission to enter the gravitational influence of another celestial body and to orbit it.\n\n== 1969 ==\nThe US wins the race for the Moon as [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]] step onto the lunar surface on July 20. [[Apollo 11]] is followed by five further landing missions, three carrying a sophisticated [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]].\n\n== 1970 ==\nThe [[Uhuru (satellite)|Uhuru satellite]], designed to map the sky at X-ray wavelengths, is launched by NASA. The existence of X-rays from the Sun and a few other stars has already been found using rocket-launched experiments, but Uhuru charts more than 300 X-ray sources, including several possible black holes.\n\n== 1971 ==\nRussia launches its first space station [[Salyut 1]] into orbit. It is followed by a series of stations, culminating with Mir in 1986. A permanent platform in orbit allows cosmonauts to carry out serious research and to set a series of new duration records for spaceflight.\n\n== 1972 ==\n[[Charles Thomas Bolton]] was the first astronomer to present irrefutable evidence of the existence of a [[black hole]].\n\n== 1975 ==\nThe Russian probe [[Venera 9]] lands on the surface of Venus and sends back the first picture of its surface. The first probe to land on another planet, [[Venera 7]] in 1970, had no camera. Both break down within an hour in the hostile atmosphere.\n\n== 1976 ==\nNASA's Viking 1 and Viking 2 space probes arrive at Mars. Each Viking mission consists of an orbiter, which photographs the planet from above, and a lander, which touches down on the surface, analyzes the rocks, and searches unsuccessfully for life.\n\n== 1977 ==\nOn August 20 the ''[[Voyager 2]]'' [[space probe]] launched by NASA to study the [[Jovian system]], [[Saturnian system]], [[Uranian system]], [[Neptunian system]], the [[Kuiper belt]], the [[heliosphere]] and the [[interstellar space]].\n\nOn September 5 The ''[[Voyager 1]]'' space probe launched by NASA to study the [[Jovian system]], Saturnian system and the [[interstellar medium]].\n\n== 1981 ==\n[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'']], the first of NASA's reusable [[Space Shuttle]]s, makes its maiden flight, ten years in development, the Shuttle will make space travel routine and eventually open the path for a new International Space Station.\n\n== 1983 ==\nThe first [[infrared astronomy]] satellite, [[IRAS]], is launched. It must be cooled to extremely low temperatures with liquid helium, and it operates for only 300 days before the supply of helium is exhausted. During this time it completes an infrared survey of 98% of the sky.\n\n== 1986 ==\nNASA's spaceflight program comes to a halt when [[Space Shuttle Challenger|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'']] explodes shortly after launch. A thorough inquiry and modifications to the rest of the fleet kept the shuttles on the ground for nearly three years.\n\nThe returning [[Halley's Comet]] is met by a fleet of five probes from Russia, Japan, and Europe. The most ambitious is the European Space Agency's [[Giotto spacecraft|''Giotta'']] spacecraft, which flies through the comet's coma and photographs the nucleus.\n\n== 1990 ==\nThe ''[[Magellan (spacecraft)|Magellan]]'' probe, launched by NASA, arrives at [[Venus]] and spends three years mapping the planet with radar. Magellan is the first in a new wave of probes that include ''[[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]]'', which arrives at Jupiter in 1995, and ''[[Cassini (spacecraft)|Cassini]]'' which arrives at [[Saturn]] in 2004.\n\nThe [[Hubble Space Telescope]], the first large optical telescope in orbit, is launched using the [[Space Shuttle]], but astronomers soon discovered that it is crippled by a problem with its mirror. A complex repair mission in 1993 allows the telescope to start producing spectacular images of distant stars, nebulae, and galaxies.\n\n== 1992 ==\nThe [[Cosmic Background Explorer]] satellite produces a detailed map of the background radiation remaining from the [[Big Bang]]. The map shows \"ripples\", caused by slight variations in the density of the early universe&nbsp;\u2013 the seeds of galaxies and galaxy clusters.\n\nThe 10-meter [[Keck telescope]] on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, is completed. The first revolutionary new wave of telescopes, the Keck's main mirror is made of 36 six-sided segments, with computers to control their alignment. New optical telescopes also make use of [[interferometry]]&nbsp;\u2013 improving resolution by combining images from separate telescopes.\n\n== 1995 ==\nThe first [[exoplanet]], [[51 Pegasi b]], is discovered by [[Michel Mayor]] and [[Didier Queloz]].\n\n== 1998 ==\nConstruction work on a huge new space station named [[ISS]] has begun.

The work contains tables for the movements of the Sun, the Moon, and the five planets known at the time. The work is significant as it introduced Ptolemaic concepts into Islamic sciences. This work also marks the turning point in Arabic astronomy. Hitherto, Arabic astronomers had adopted a primarily research approach to the field, translating works of others and learning already discovered knowledge. Al-Khwarizmi's work marked the beginning of nontraditional methods of study and calculations.<ref>Dallal (1999), pg. 163</ref>\n\n== 850 ==\n[[Alfraganus|al-Farghani]] wrote ''Kitab fi Jawani'' (\"''A compendium of the science of stars''\"). The book primarily gave a summary of Ptolemic cosmography. However, it also corrected Ptolemy based on findings of earlier Arab astronomers. Al-Farghani gave revised values for the obliquity of the ecliptic, the precessional movement of the [[apogee]]s of the Sun and the Moon, and the circumference of the Earth. The books were widely circulated through the Muslim world, and even translated into [[Latin]].<ref>Dallal (1999), pg. 164</ref>\n\n== 928 ==\nThe earliest surviving [[astrolabe]] is constructed by Islamic [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|mathematician]]\u2013[[Astronomy in the medieval Islamic world|astronomer]] [[Mohammad al-Fazari]]. Astrolabes are the most advanced instruments of their time. The precise measurement of the positions of stars and planets allows Islamic astronomers to compile the most detailed [[almanac]]s and [[star atlas]]es yet.\n\n== 1030 ==\n[[Ab\u016b Ray\u1e25\u0101n al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b]] discussed the Indian heliocentric theories of [[Aryabhata]], [[Brahmagupta]] and [[Var\u0101hamihira]] in his ''Ta'rikh al-Hind'' (''Indica'' in Latin). Biruni stated that the followers of Aryabhata consider the Earth to be at the center. In fact, Biruni casually stated that this does not create any mathematical problems.<ref>Saliba (1999).</ref>\n\n== 1031 ==\n[[Abu Sa'id al-Sijzi]], a contemporary of [[Abu Rayhan Biruni]], defended the theory that Earth revolves around its axis.\n\n== 1054 ==\nChinese astronomers record the sudden appearance of a bright star. Native-American rock carvings also show the brilliant star close to the Moon. This star is the Crab [[supernova]] exploding.\n\n== 1070 ==\nAbu Ubayd al-Juzjani published the ''Tarik al-Aflak''. In his work, he indicated the so-called \"[[equant]]\" problem of the [[Geocentric model|Ptolemic model]]. Al-Juzjani even proposed a solution for the problem. In [[al-Andalus]], the anonymous work ''al-Istidrak ala Batlamyus'' (meaning \"Recapitulation regarding Ptolemy\"), included a list of objections to the Ptolemic astronomy.\n\nOne of the most important works in the period was ''Al-Shuku ala Batlamyus'' (\"''Doubts on Ptolemy''\"). In this, the author summed up the inconsistencies of the Ptolemic models. Many astronomers took up the challenge posed in this work, namely to develop alternate models that evaded such errors.\n\n== 1126 ==\n[[Islamic astronomy|Islamic]] and [[Indian astronomy|Indian]] astronomical works (including ''Aryabhatiya'' and ''Brahma-Sphuta-Siddhanta'') are translated into Latin in [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain]] in 1126, introducing European astronomers to Islamic and Indian astronomy.\n\n== 1150 ==\nIndian mathematician-astronomer [[Bh\u0101skara II]], in his ''Siddhanta Shiromani'', calculates the [[longitude]]s and [[latitude]]s of the planets, lunar and solar eclipses, risings and settings, the Moon's [[moon|lunar]] [[crescent]], [[Syzygy (astronomy)|syzygies]], and conjunctions of the planets with each other and with the [[fixed stars]], and explains the three problems of [[Diurnal motion|diurnal rotation]]. He also calculates the planetary [[mean motion]], ellipses, first visibilities of the planets, the lunar crescent, the seasons, and the length of the Earth's revolution around the Sun to 9 decimal places.\n\n== 1190 ==\n\n[[Al-Bitruji]] proposed an alternative geocentric system to Ptolemy's.

Ibn al-Shatir proposed a system that was only approximately geocentric, rather than exactly so, having demonstrated [[trigonometry|trigonometrically]] that the Earth was not the exact center of the universe. His rectification is later used in the Copernican model.\n\n== 1543 ==\n[[Nicolaus Copernicus]] publishes ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' containing his theory that Earth travels around the Sun. However, he complicates his theory by retaining Plato's perfect circular orbits of the planets.\n\n== 1572 ==\nA brilliant supernova ([[SN 1572]] - thought, at the time, to be a comet) is observed by [[Tycho Brahe]], who proves that it is traveling beyond Earth's atmosphere and therefore provides the first evidence that the heavens can change.\n\n== 1608 ==\nDutch eyeglass maker [[Hans Lippershey]] tries to patent a [[refracting telescope]] (the first historical record of one). The invention spreads rapidly across Europe, as scientists make their own instruments. Their discoveries begin a revolution in astronomy.\n\n== 1609 ==\n[[Johannes Kepler]] publishes his ''[[Astronomia nova|New Astronomy]]''. In this and later works, he announces his [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|three laws of planetary motion]], replacing the circular orbits of Plato with [[Ellipse|elliptical]] ones. [[Almanac]]s based on his laws prove to be highly accurate.\n\n== 1610 ==\n[[Galileo Galilei]] publishes ''[[Sidereus Nuncius]]'' describing the findings of his observations with the telescope he built. These include spots on the Sun, craters on the Moon, and four satellites of Jupiter. Proving that not everything orbits Earth, he promotes the Copernican view of a Sun-centered universe.\n\n== 1655 ==\nAs the power and the quality of the telescopes increase, [[Christiaan Huygens]] studies Saturn and discovers its largest satellite, Titan. He also explains Saturn's appearance, suggesting the planet is surrounded by a thin ring.\n\n== 1663 ==\nScottish astronomer [[James Gregory (mathematician)|James Gregory]] describes his \"[[Gregorian telescope|gregorian]]\" [[reflecting telescope]], using [[Parabolic reflector|parabolic mirrors]] instead of lenses to reduce [[chromatic aberration]] and [[spherical aberration]], but is unable to build one.\n\n== 1668 ==\nIsaac Newton builds the first [[reflecting telescope]], his [[Newtonian telescope]].\n\n== 1687 ==\n[[Isaac Newton]] publishes his first copy of the book ''Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica'', establishing the theory of gravitation and laws of motion. The ''Principia'' explains Kepler's laws of planetary motion and allows astronomers to understand the forces acting between the Sun, the planets, and their moons.\n\n== 1705 ==\n[[Edmond Halley]] calculates that the comets recorded at 76-year intervals from 1456 to 1682 are one and the same. He predicts that the comet will return again in 1758. When it reappears as expected, the comet is named in his honor.\n\n== 1750 ==\nFrench astronomer [[Nicolas de Lacaille]] sails to southern oceans and begins work compiling a catalog of more than 10000 stars in the southern sky. Although Halley and others have observed from the Southern Hemisphere before, Lacaille's star catalog is the first comprehensive one of the southern sky.\n\n== 1781 ==\nAmateur astronomer [[William Herschel]] discovers the planet Uranus, although he at first mistakes it for a comet. Uranus is the first planet to be discovered beyond Saturn, which was thought to be the most distant planet in ancient times.\n\n== 1784 ==\n[[Charles Messier]] publishes his catalog of star clusters and nebulas. Messier draws up the list to prevent these objects from being identified as comets. However, it soon becomes a standard reference for the study of star clusters and nebulars and is still in use today.\n\n== 1800 ==\nWilliam Herschel splits sunlight through a prism and with a thermometer, measures the energy given out by different colours. He notices a sudden increase in energy beyond the red end of the [[spectrum]], discovering invisible infrared and laying the foundations of spectroscopy.\n\n== 1801 ==\nItalian astronomer [[Giuseppe Piazzi]] discovers what appears to be a new planet orbiting between Mars and Jupiter, and names it [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]]. [[William Herschel]] proves it is a very small object, calculating it to be only 320&nbsp;km in diameter, and not a planet. He proposes the name asteroid, and soon other similar bodies are being found. We now know that Ceres is 932&nbsp;km in diameter, and is now considered to be a dwarf planet.\n\n== 1814 ==\n[[Joseph von Fraunhofer]] builds the first accurate spectrometer and uses it to study the spectrum of the Sun's light. He discovers and maps hundreds of fine dark lines crossing the solar spectrum. In 1859 these lines are linked to chemical elements in the Sun's atmosphere. Spectroscopy becomes a method for studying what stars are made of.\n\n== 1838 ==\n[[Friedrich Bessel]] successfully uses the method of stellar parallax, the effect of Earth's annual movement around the Sun, to calculate the distance to [[61 Cygni]], the first star other than the Sun to have its distance from Earth measured. Bessel's is a truly accurate measurement of stellar positions, and the parallax technique establishes a framework for measuring the scale of the universe.\n\n== 1843 ==\nGerman amateur astronomer [[Heinrich Schwabe]], who has been studying the [[Sun]] for the past 17 years, announces his discovery of a regular cycle in sunspot numbers - the first clue to the Sun's internal structure.\n\n== 1845 ==\nIrish astronomer [[William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse]] completes the first of the world's [[Leviathan of Parsonstown|great telescopes]], with a 180-cm mirror. He uses it to study and draw the structure of nebulas, and within a few months discovers the spiral structure of the [[Whirlpool Galaxy]].\n\nFrench physicists [[Jean Foucault]] and [[Armand Fizeau]] take the first detailed photographs of the Sun's surface through a telescope - the birth of scientific astrophotography. Within five years, astronomers produce the first detailed photographs of the Moon. Early film is not sensitive enough to image stars.\n\n== 1846 ==\nA new planet, [[Neptune]], is identified by German astronomer [[Johann Gottfried Galle]] while searching in the position suggested by [[Urbain Le Verrier]]. Le Verrier has calculated the position and size of the planet from the effects of its gravitational pull on the orbit of Uranus. An English mathematician, [[John Couch Adams]], also made a similar calculation a year earlier.\n\n== 1868 ==\nAstronomers notice a new bright emission line in the spectrum of the Sun's atmosphere during an eclipse. The emission line is caused by an element's giving out light, and British astronomer [[Norman Lockyer]] concludes that it is an element unknown on Earth. He calls it [[helium]], from the Greek word for the Sun. Nearly 30 years later, helium is found on Earth.\n\n== 1872 ==\nAn American astronomer [[Henry Draper]] takes the first photograph of the spectrum of a star (Vega), showing absorption lines that reveal its chemical makeup. Astronomers begin to see that spectroscopy is the key to understanding how stars evolve. [[William Huggins]] uses absorption lines to measure the redshifts of stars, which give the first indication of how fast stars are moving.\n\n== 1895 ==\n[[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]] publishes his first article on the possibility of space flight. His greatest discovery is that a rocket, unlike other forms of propulsion, will work in a vacuum. He also outlines the principle of a multistage launch vehicle.\n\n== 1901 ==\nA comprehensive survey of stars, the ''[[Henry Draper Catalogue]]'', is published. In the catalog, [[Annie Jump Cannon]] proposes a sequence of classifying stars by the absorption lines in their spectra, which is still in use today.\n\n== 1906 ==\n[[Ejnar Hertzsprung]] establishes the standard for measuring the true brightness of a star. He shows that there is a relationship between color and absolute magnitude for 90% of the stars in the Milky Way Galaxy. In 1913, [[Henry Norris Russell]] publishes a diagram that shows this relationship. Although astronomers agree that the diagram shows the sequence in which stars evolve, they argue about which way the sequence progresses. [[Arthur Eddington]] finally settles the controversy in 1924.\n\n== 1910 ==\n[[Williamina Fleming]] publishes her discovery of [[white dwarf]] stars.\n\n==1912==\n[[Henrietta Swan Leavitt]] discovers the [[period-luminosity relation]] for [[Cepheid variable]]s, whereas the brightness of a star is proportional to its luminosity oscillation period. It opened a whole new branch of possibilities of measuring distances on the universe, and this discovery was the basis for the work done by [[Edwin Hubble]] on extragalactic astronomy.\n\n== 1916 ==\nGerman physicist [[Karl Schwarzschild]] uses [[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of general relativity to lay the groundwork for black hole theory. He suggests that if any star collapse to a certain size or smaller, its gravity will be so strong that no form of radiation will escape from it.\n\n== 1923 ==\n[[Edwin Hubble]] discovers a [[Cepheid variable]] star in the \"Andromeda Nebula\" and proves that Andromeda and other nebulas are galaxies far beyond our own. By 1925, he produces a classification system for galaxies.\n\n== 1925 ==\n[[Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin]] discovers that [[hydrogen]] is the most abundant element in the Sun's atmosphere, and accordingly, the most abundant element in the universe by relating the spectral classes of stars to their actual temperatures and by applying the ionization theory developed by Indian physicist [[Meghnad Saha]]. This opens the path for the study of stellar atmospheres and chemical abundances, contributing to understand the chemical evolution of the universe.\n\n== 1926 ==\n[[Robert Goddard]] launches the first rocket powered by liquid fuel. He also demonstrates that a rocket can work in a vacuum. His later rockets break the sound barrier for the first time.\n\n== 1929 ==\n[[Edwin Hubble]] discovered that the universe is expanding and that the farther away a galaxy is, the faster it is moving away from us. Two years later, [[Georges Lema\u00eetre]] suggests that the expansion can be traced to an initial \"Big Bang\".\n\n== 1930 ==\nBy applying new ideas from subatomic physics, [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]] predicts that the atoms in a white dwarf star of more than 1.44 solar masses will disintegrate, causing the star to collapse violently. In 1933, [[Walter Baade]] and [[Fritz Zwicky]] describe the neutron star that results from this collapse, causing a supernova explosion.\n\n[[Clyde Tombaugh]] discovers the dwarf planet [[Pluto]] at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. The object is so faint and moving so slowly that he has to compare photos taken several nights apart.\n\n== 1932 ==\n[[Karl Jansky]] detects the first radio waves coming from space. In 1942, radio waves from the Sun are detected. Seven years later radio astronomers identify the first distant source - the Crab Nebula, and the galaxies Centaurus A and M87.\n\n== 1938 ==\nGerman physicist [[Hans Bethe]] explains how stars generate energy. He outlines a series of nuclear fusion reactions that turn hydrogen into helium and release enormous amounts of energy in a star's core. These reactions use the star's hydrogen very slowly, allowing it to burn for billions of years.\n\n== 1944 ==\nA team of German scientists led by [[Wernher von Braun]] develops the [[V-2]], the first rocket-powered ballistic missile. Scientists and engineers from Braun's team were captured at the end of [[World War II]] and drafted into the American and Russian rocket programs.\n\n== 1948 ==\nThe largest telescope in the world, with a 5.08m (200&nbsp;in) mirror, is completed at Palomar Mountain in California. At the time, the telescope pushes single-mirror telescope technology to its limits - large mirrors tend to bend under their own weight.\n\n== 1957 ==\nRussia launches the first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, into orbit, beginning the space age. The US launches its first satellite, Explorer 1, four months later.\n\n== 1958 ==\nJuly 29 marks the beginning of the [[NASA]] (National Aeronautics and Space Administration), agency newly created by the United States to catch up with Soviet space technologies. It absorbs all research centers and staffs of the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics|NACA]] (National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics), an organization founded in 1915.\n\n== 1959 ==\nRussia and the US both launch probes to the Moon, but NASA's Pioneer probes all failed. The Russian Luna program was more successful. Luna 2 crash-lands on the Moon's surface in September, and Luna 3 returns the first pictures of the Moon's farside in October.\n\n== 1960 ==\n[[Cornell University]] astronomer [[Frank Drake]] performed the first modern [[SETI]] experiment, named \"[[Project Ozma]]\", after the [[Princess Ozma|Queen of Oz]] in [[L. Frank Baum]]'s fantasy books.<ref>\"Science: Project Ozma,\" [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,874057,00.html ''Time,'' April 18, 1960] (web version accessed 17 October 2017)</ref>\n\n== 1961 ==\nRussia takes the lead in the space race as [[Yuri Gagarin]] becomes the first person to orbit Earth in April.

NASA follows this with the successful Mariner 4 mission to Mars in 1965, both the US and Russia send many more probes to planets through the rest of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n== 1963 ==\nDutch-American astronomer [[Maarten Schmidt]] measures the spectra of quasars, the mysterious star-like radio sources discovered in 1960. He establishes that quasars are active galaxies, and among the most distant objects in the universe.\n\n== 1965 ==\n[[Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson|Robert Wilson]] announce the discovery of a weak radio signal coming from all parts of the sky. Scientists figure out that this must be emitted by an object at a temperature of -270&nbsp;\u00b0C. Soon it is recognized as the remnant of the very hot radiation from the Big Bang that created the universe 13 billion years ago, see [[Cosmic microwave background]]. This radio signal is emitted by the electron in hydrogen flipping from pointing up or down and is approximated to happen once in a million years for every particle. Hydrogen is present in interstellar space gas throughout the entire universe and most dense in nebulae which is where the signals originate. Even though the electron of hydrogen only flips once every million years the mere quantity of hydrogen in space gas makes the presence of these radio waves prominent.\n\n== 1966 ==\nRussian [[Luna 9]] probe makes the first successful soft landing on the Moon in January, while the US lands the far more complex Surveyor missions, which follows up to NASA's Ranger series of crash-landers, scout sites for possible manned landings.\n\n== 1967 ==\n[[Jocelyn Bell Burnell]] and [[Antony Hewish]] detected the first pulsar, an object emitting regular pulses of radio waves. Pulsars are eventually recognized as rapidly spinning neutron stars with intense magnetic fields - the remains of a supernova explosion.\n\n== 1968 ==\nNASA's [[Apollo 8]] mission becomes the first human spaceflight mission to enter the gravitational influence of another celestial body and to orbit it.\n\n== 1969 ==\nThe US wins the race for the Moon as [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]] step onto the lunar surface on July 20. [[Apollo 11]] is followed by five further landing missions, three carrying a sophisticated [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]].\n\n== 1970 ==\nThe [[Uhuru (satellite)|Uhuru satellite]], designed to map the sky at X-ray wavelengths, is launched by NASA. The existence of X-rays from the Sun and a few other stars has already been found using rocket-launched experiments, but Uhuru charts more than 300 X-ray sources, including several possible black holes.\n\n== 1971 ==\nRussia launches its first space station [[Salyut 1]] into orbit. It is followed by a series of stations, culminating with Mir in 1986. A permanent platform in orbit allows cosmonauts to carry out serious research and to set a series of new duration records for spaceflight.\n\n== 1972 ==\n[[Charles Thomas Bolton]] was the first astronomer to present irrefutable evidence of the existence of a [[black hole]].\n\n== 1975 ==\nThe Russian probe [[Venera 9]] lands on the surface of Venus and sends back the first picture of its surface. The first probe to land on another planet, [[Venera 7]] in 1970, had no camera. Both break down within an hour in the hostile atmosphere.\n\n== 1976 ==\nNASA's Viking 1 and Viking 2 space probes arrive at Mars. Each Viking mission consists of an orbiter, which photographs the planet from above, and a lander, which touches down on the surface, analyzes the rocks, and searches unsuccessfully for life.\n\n== 1977 ==\nOn August 20 the ''[[Voyager 2]]'' [[space probe]] launched by NASA to study the [[Jovian system]], [[Saturnian system]], [[Uranian system]], [[Neptunian system]], the [[Kuiper belt]], the [[heliosphere]] and the [[interstellar space]].\n\nOn September 5 The ''[[Voyager 1]]'' space probe launched by NASA to study the [[Jovian system]], Saturnian system and the [[interstellar medium]].\n\n== 1981 ==\n[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'']], the first of NASA's reusable [[Space Shuttle]]s, makes its maiden flight, ten years in development, the Shuttle will make space travel routine and eventually open the path for a new International Space Station.\n\n== 1983 ==\nThe first [[infrared astronomy]] satellite, [[IRAS]], is launched. It must be cooled to extremely low temperatures with liquid helium, and it operates for only 300 days before the supply of helium is exhausted. During this time it completes an infrared survey of 98% of the sky.\n\n== 1986 ==\nNASA's spaceflight program comes to a halt when [[Space Shuttle Challenger|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'']] explodes shortly after launch. A thorough inquiry and modifications to the rest of the fleet kept the shuttles on the ground for nearly three years.\n\nThe returning [[Halley's Comet]] is met by a fleet of five probes from Russia, Japan, and Europe. The most ambitious is the European Space Agency's [[Giotto spacecraft|''Giotta'']] spacecraft, which flies through the comet's coma and photographs the nucleus.\n\n== 1990 ==\nThe ''[[Magellan (spacecraft)|Magellan]]'' probe, launched by NASA, arrives at [[Venus]] and spends three years mapping the planet with radar. Magellan is the first in a new wave of probes that include ''[[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]]'', which arrives at Jupiter in 1995, and ''[[Cassini (spacecraft)|Cassini]]'' which arrives at [[Saturn]] in 2004.\n\nThe [[Hubble Space Telescope]], the first large optical telescope in orbit, is launched using the [[Space Shuttle]], but astronomers soon discovered that it is crippled by a problem with its mirror. A complex repair mission in 1993 allows the telescope to start producing spectacular images of distant stars, nebulae, and galaxies.\n\n== 1992 ==\nThe [[Cosmic Background Explorer]] satellite produces a detailed map of the background radiation remaining from the [[Big Bang]]. The map shows \"ripples\", caused by slight variations in the density of the early universe&nbsp;\u2013 the seeds of galaxies and galaxy clusters.\n\nThe 10-meter [[Keck telescope]] on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, is completed. The first revolutionary new wave of telescopes, the Keck's main mirror is made of 36 six-sided segments, with computers to control their alignment. New optical telescopes also make use of [[interferometry]]&nbsp;\u2013 improving resolution by combining images from separate telescopes.\n\n== 1995 ==\nThe first [[exoplanet]], [[51 Pegasi b]], is discovered by [[Michel Mayor]] and [[Didier Queloz]].\n\n== 1998 ==\nConstruction work on a huge new space station named [[ISS]] has begun. A joint venture between many countries, including former space rivals Russia and the US.<!--Almost nothing happened in 20 years (1992\u20132012)?-->\n\n== 2005 ==\n[[Mike Brown (astronomer)|Mike Brown]] and his team discovered [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]] a large body in the outer Solar System<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/The_Discovery_Of_Eris_999.html |title=The Discovery of Eris |publisher=Space Daily |date=2 March 2007 |access-date=6 June 2015}}</ref> which was temporarily named as {{mp|2003|UB|313}}.

It is made up of the main town, Kot, and the nearby Putli village. Originally, both villages belonged to a [[Marwari people|Marwari]] business family, however, they are now considered as one city. People have lived in Kotputli for many years, and many ancient institutions such as temples and schools can be found there. Kotputli was historically a part of the [[Khatri Riyasat]] (now [[Alwar]]) kingdom, which had its capital at the nearby village of Bairath during the period of [[Mahabharta|Mahabharata]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldstatesmen.org/India_princes_A-J.html|title=Indian Princely States before 1947 A-J|website=www.worldstatesmen.org|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref> \n\nRaja Sardar Singh of Khetri constructed many buildings in Kotputli. For example, Sardar School and Sardar Zanana Hospital were made by local Gurjar bodies in conjunction with the Tijoriwala family. Many schools and hospitals have emerged in Kotputli since.
