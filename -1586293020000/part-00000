In [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]] the United States scored one of its most surprising victories with a [[United States v England (1950 FIFA World Cup)|1\u20130 win]] over heavily favored [[England national football team|England]], who were amongst the world's best sides at the time.\n\nThe United States did not reach another World Cup until an upstart team qualified for the [[1990 World Cup]] with the \"goal heard around the world\" scored by [[Paul Caligiuri]] against [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]], which started the modern era of soccer in the United States. The 1990 men's national team was quickly disposed of at the World Cup, but nonetheless had qualified for its first World Cup in 40 years.\n\nThe United States hosted the [[1994 World Cup|1994 FIFA World Cup]], setting total and average attendance records that still stand, including drawing 94,194 fans to the [[1994 FIFA World Cup Final|final]]. The United States made a surprising run to the second round with a shocking victory over [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] which saw [[Andr\u00e9s Escobar]], the player responsible for the United States' first goal (an own goal), later shot to death in his homeland.\n\n[[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]] saw another disappointing addition to the history of the men's national team as it finished last out of the 32 teams that qualified for the World Cup. This embarrassment, which included a total collapse of team chemistry and leadership, led to the firing of manager [[Steve Sampson]].\n\nThe U.S. team hired [[Bruce Arena]], who had won the first two [[MLS Cup]]s in [[Major League Soccer]] history, and who went on to become the most successful United States men's national team manager in history. In [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] Bruce Arena led a mix of veterans and MLS-seasoned youth to a quarterfinal appearance, dispatching contenders [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] in [[2002 FIFA World Cup Group D|Group D]] play and archrivals [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] in the Round of 16, before losing a closely fought game with eventual runners-up [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in the quarterfinal.\n\nThe team looked to match or surpass that feat in [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]]; the U.S. was drawn into [[2006 FIFA World Cup Group E|Group E]] with [[Italy national football team|Italy]], the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]] and [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]]. The United States lost to the Czech Republic 3\u20130 in their opening game, drew Italy, 1\u20131, in their second game (a match that saw two U.S. players and an Italian player [[Red card (soccer)|red carded]]), and lost to Ghana, 2\u20131. The United States did not qualify for a knockout round, but were the only team to face eventual champion Italy without losing. In the wake of the team's disappointing performance, Arena's contract was not renewed.\n\n[[Bob Bradley]], [[C.D.

In the Round of 16, the United States played with [[2010 FIFA World Cup Group D|Group D]] runners-up [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]], and fell 2\u20131 in [[Extra time (association football)|overtime]] (OT).\n\nEntering the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] in Brazil, the U.S team won all three friendly \"send-off\" matches leading up to the competition: 2\u20130, over [[Azerbaijan national football team|Azerbaijan]], 2\u20131, over [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]], and 2\u20131 over fellow World Cup participant and defending [[Africa Cup of Nations|African]] champions [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]]. They were led at the time by [[J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann]], who helped lead West Germany to victory in the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]] and was the first player to score at least three goals in three consecutive World Cups.\n\nDuring the 2014 FIFA World Cup, the U.S. won their first match against Ghana, 2\u20131. [[Clint Dempsey]] scored in the first minute of the match giving the U.S. the early lead. Ghana did not respond until the 82nd minute scoring the equalizer goal. The U.S. then reclaimed the lead, thanks to [[John Anthony Brooks|John Brooks]] scoring the game-winning goal off his head just four minutes later in the 86th minute to regain the lead and take the match. The U.S. gained three points for their win and was off to a great start in the \"[[Group of Death]]\" claimed by critics for the teams the U.S. would have to go through in [[2014 FIFA World Cup Group G|Group G]] ([[Germany national football team|Germany]], [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]], and [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]]).\n\nThe second match of the World Cup for the U.S. was a different story. Portugal claimed the early lead, with [[Nani]] scoring in the 5th minute to take the early 1\u20130 lead. It wasn't till the 64th minute till the U.S. scored the equalizing goal, thanks to [[Jermaine Jones]], tying the match at 1 apiece. The U.S. then claimed the lead on a goal by Clint Dempsey again, scoring in the 81st minute to take a 2\u20131 lead. However, in the final minute of extra time, the world player of the year, [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] drilled a perfect cross to teammate [[Silvestre Varela]] who headed in the tying goal, making the final score 2\u20132. The tie gave each team a point in the overall standings, bringing the U.S. to 4 points total, and gave Portugal their first point of the World Cup having lost their opening match to Germany, 4\u20130. The U.S. claimed a spot in the knockout round in spite of a 1\u20130 loss to eventual champion Germany in their final [[2014 FIFA World Cup Group G|Group G]] game due to them winning the tiebreaker with Portugal. However, they bowed out the tournament in the round of 16 in a 2\u20131 loss to [[2014 FIFA World Cup Group H|Group H]] winner [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]]. Goalkeeper [[Tim Howard]] helped the U.S. keep a 0\u20130 tie at full time. In extra time, there were two Belgian goals. The U.S. struck back with a goal by 19-year-old phenom [[Julian Green]] but could not manage another goal. [[J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann]] was let go after he has been fired as USMNT Director of Coaching and was replaced by Bruce Arena in November 2016.\n\nThe U.S. finished in fifth place in the [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 CONCACAF Fifth Round|Final round]] of the [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONCACAF)|CONCACAF qualifying]] for the spot of the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], which concluded in October 2017.

Though organized locally by organizations all over the United States, there are two main youth soccer organizations working nationwide through affiliated local associations. The [[United States Youth Soccer Association]] boasts over three million players between the ages of five and 19, while [[American Youth Soccer Organization]] has more than 300,000 players between the ages of four and 19.

The league began an aggressive expansion in 2017, with the goal of adding at least eight clubs but ultimately adding 10. The expansion saw the following clubs added: [[Atlanta United FC]] (2017), [[Minnesota United FC]] (2017), [[Los Angeles FC]] (2018), [[FC Cincinnati]] (2019), [[Inter Miami CF]] (2020), [[Nashville SC (MLS)|Nashville SC]] (2020), [[Austin FC]] (2021), [[Charlotte MLS team|Charlotte]] (2021), [[Sacramento Republic FC]] (2022) and [[St. Louis MLS team|St. Louis]] (2022). The league operates as a single-entity league, which means MLS, and not the individual teams, holds the contracts on players.\n\nThe one sanctioned second-division men's outdoor soccer league is the [[USL Championship]] (USLC). Previously, the second [[North American Soccer League]] had second-division status, sharing it with the USL in the 2017 season, but the NASL was denied second-division sanctioning for 2018 due to considerable instability in the league;<ref>{{cite web| url=http://fiftyfive.one/2017/09/us-soccer-federation-rejects-nasls-division-ii-application/|title=US Soccer Federation Rejects NASL's Division II Application |date= September 5, 2017}}</ref> the league effectively folded at that time.\n\nThe USLC was sanctioned as the United States' lone Division II men's outdoor soccer league in 2018. Formed in 2010 as a result of the merger of the former [[USL First Division]] and [[USL Second Division]], the USL Championship was sanctioned as Division III league from 2011 to 2016 before becoming provisionally sanctioned as a Division II league for 2017,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.si.com/planet-futbol/2017/01/06/us-soccer-division-two-sanctioning-usl-nasl |title=U.S. Soccer grants provisional division two sanctioning to both NASL, USL |last=Straus |first=Brian |date=January 6, 2017 |work=Sports Illustrated }}</ref> and receiving full Division II sanctioning in 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/90minutes/mls/ct-90mins-us-soccer-grants-usl-2nd-division-status-20180117-story.html |title=US Soccer grants USL 2nd-division status |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=January 17, 2018}}</ref> \n\nThe USL Championship has expanded almost three-fold since its first season in 2011 to include 35 teams in the 2020 season, with the league divided into two conferences, Eastern and Western. The USLC is the world's largest Division II professional league by number of teams. Since 2014, valuation of USL Championship clubs have increased five-fold. In revenue, 2018 Championship clubs saw a 28% increase over 2017 numbers on an average of ticketing, sponsorship, merchandise, and ancillary revenue generation.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe USLC also holds a broadcast agreement with ESPN that sees 20 regular season games televised nationally on ESPN2, ESPNews and ESPN Deportes<ref>https://www.uslsoccer.com/news_article/show/1044596</ref> in addition to national broadcast of the USL Championship Final, which in 2019 was aired on both ESPN2 and ESPN Deportes. The league's remaining regular season games are broadcast nationally on ESPN+, with 22 of the Championship's clubs also holding local broadcast agreements. The USL Championship's broadcast agreement was made possible in large part by a major investment by USL with league technology partner Vista Worldlink<ref>https://www.uslsoccer.com/news_article/show/751106-vista-usl-productions-form-cutting-edge-initiative</ref> to establish a USL Broadcast Center out of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.<ref>https://www.sportsvideo.org/2017/04/21/vista-worldlink-goes-all-in-on-at-home-production-with-overhauled-facility/</ref>\n\nThe second NASL had no official tie to the [[North American Soccer League (1968\u20131984)|former NASL]] that operated from 1968 to 1984, although some of the teams shared names with their historic counterparts. Unlike MLS that is a single-entity operation, the second NASL, like the old NASL, had no salary cap and players were contracted by the individual teams.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.nasl.com/media-guide/2011/Media%20Guide_Final_11-07-2011_book.pdf |title=NASL 2011 Media Guide |date=November 7, 2011}}</ref> The season was a split format (similar to that of [[Apertura and Clausura|many leagues in Latin America]]) that features seven teams, including one [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] team. Previous to the reorganization of the NASL in 2009, the [[USL First Division]] operated as the professional second-division league in the United States. However, a dispute among its teams and ownership led to the creation of the NASL which applied for and was awarded by USSF second division status. The 2010 season was played as a combined USL/NASL league format before NASL officially separated in 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thesoccerroom.com/?p=25480 |title=FC Edmonton wins first-ever NASL game |publisher=The Soccer Room |date=April 10, 2011 |accessdate=October 7, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113090308/http://thesoccerroom.com/?p=25480 |archive-date=November 13, 2011 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nUSL League One is sanctioned at the Men's Division III level.

The champion of WPS' first season in 2009 was [[Sky Blue FC]], out of the New York\u2013New Jersey area. They defeated the [[Los Angeles Sol]] 1\u20130 at The Home Depot Center in Carson, California. WPS launched with seven teams, all based in the United States. The Sol folded after the league's inaugural season, and two new teams joined for 2010, bringing WPS to eight teams. However, the 2010 season saw considerable instability, with another charter team, [[Saint Louis Athletica]], folding during the season, champions [[FC Gold Pride]] folding after the season, and the [[Chicago Red Stars]] deciding to regroup in the second-tier [[Women's Premier Soccer League]] (WPSL). The 2011 season, in which six teams based along the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] played, was marked by low attendance for most of the season and conflict with [[Dan Borislow]], who had purchased the former [[Washington Freedom]], moved the team to [[Miami metropolitan area|South Florida]], and renamed it [[MagicJack (WPS)|magicJack]]. The dispute between WPS and Borislow led the league to suspend the magicJack franchise, with Borislow responding by suing. The legal battle led WPS to suspend its 2012 season, with hopes of returning in 2013, but WPS soon decided to fold completely.\n\n====National Women's Soccer League (NWSL), 2013\u2013present====\n{{main|National Women's Soccer League}}\n[[File:Portland Thorns FC players (16497728163).jpg|240px|thumb|right|[[Portland Thorns]] players before a match, April 2015]]\nOn November 21, 2012, U.S. Soccer, in conjunction with the [[Canadian Soccer Association]] (CSA) and [[Mexican Football Federation]] (FMF), announced the formation of a new professional league for the 2013 season.<ref name=\"2013 women's league\">{{cite press release |url=http://www.ussoccer.com/News/Womens-National-Team/2012/11/US-Soccer-President-Sunil-Gulati-Announces-New-Womens-League-for-2013.aspx |title=U.S. Soccer President Sunil Gulati Announces New Women's League to Begin Play in Spring of 2013 |publisher=United States Soccer Federation |date=November 21, 2012 |accessdate=December 4, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130101173733/http://www.ussoccer.com/News/Womens-National-Team/2012/11/US-Soccer-President-Sunil-Gulati-Announces-New-Womens-League-for-2013.aspx |archive-date=January 1, 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> The league, unnamed at the time of the initial announcement but later unveiled as the [[National Women's Soccer League]] (NWSL), launched in April 2013 with eight teams.<ref name=\"2013 women's league\"/> Like WUSA and WPS, NWSL teams are privately owned with some owned by existing [[Major League Soccer|MLS]] teams.<ref name=Carlisle>{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/blog/_/name/soccerusa/id/661?cc=5901|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128075504/http://soccernet.espn.go.com/blog/_/name/soccerusa/id/661?cc=5901|archivedate=November 28, 2012 |title=Hopes high for new women's soccer league |first=Jeff |last=Carlisle |series=Soccer USA blog|work=[[ESPN FC]] |date=November 21, 2012 |accessdate=December 8, 2012}}</ref> The American and Canadian federations pay the salaries for many of their respective national team members.

In [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]] the United States scored one of its most surprising victories with a [[United States v England (1950 FIFA World Cup)|1\u20130 win]] over heavily favored [[England national football team|England]], who were amongst the world's best sides at the time.\n\nThe United States did not reach another World Cup until an upstart team qualified for the [[1990 World Cup]] with the \"goal heard around the world\" scored by [[Paul Caligiuri]] against [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]], which started the modern era of soccer in the United States. The 1990 men's national team was quickly disposed of at the World Cup, but nonetheless had qualified for its first World Cup in 40 years.\n\nThe United States hosted the [[1994 World Cup|1994 FIFA World Cup]], setting total and average attendance records that still stand, including drawing 94,194 fans to the [[1994 FIFA World Cup Final|final]]. The United States made a surprising run to the second round with a shocking victory over [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] which saw [[Andr\u00e9s Escobar]], the player responsible for the United States' first goal (an own goal), later shot to death in his homeland.\n\n[[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]] saw another disappointing addition to the history of the men's national team as it finished last out of the 32 teams that qualified for the World Cup. This embarrassment, which included a total collapse of team chemistry and leadership, led to the firing of manager [[Steve Sampson]].\n\nThe U.S. team hired [[Bruce Arena]], who had won the first two [[MLS Cup]]s in [[Major League Soccer]] history, and who went on to become the most successful United States men's national team manager in history. In [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] Bruce Arena led a mix of veterans and MLS-seasoned youth to a quarterfinal appearance, dispatching contenders [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] in [[2002 FIFA World Cup Group D|Group D]] play and archrivals [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] in the Round of 16, before losing a closely fought game with eventual runners-up [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in the quarterfinal.\n\nThe team looked to match or surpass that feat in [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]]; the U.S. was drawn into [[2006 FIFA World Cup Group E|Group E]] with [[Italy national football team|Italy]], the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]] and [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]]. The United States lost to the Czech Republic 3\u20130 in their opening game, drew Italy, 1\u20131, in their second game (a match that saw two U.S. players and an Italian player [[Red card (soccer)|red carded]]), and lost to Ghana, 2\u20131. The United States did not qualify for a knockout round, but were the only team to face eventual champion Italy without losing. In the wake of the team's disappointing performance, Arena's contract was not renewed.\n\n[[Bob Bradley]], [[C.D. Chivas USA|Chivas USA]] manager and Arena's assistant manager with the men's national team, eventually succeeded Arena in 2007. The U.S. qualified for the [[2010 World Cup|2010 FIFA World Cup]] in South Africa,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espnfc.com/match?id=279519&cc=5901|title=October 10, 2009: Honduras 2\u20133 USA|publisher=espnfc.com}}</ref> winning the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 CONCACAF Fourth Round|CONCACAF qualifying tournament]]. At the World Cup, the Americans tied England 1\u20131, tied [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]], 2\u20132. and then won their group in [[2010 FIFA World Cup Group C|Group C]] by defeating [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]] 1\u20130 on a stoppage time goal by Landon Donovan. In the Round of 16, the United States played with [[2010 FIFA World Cup Group D|Group D]] runners-up [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]], and fell 2\u20131 in [[Extra time (association football)|overtime]] (OT).\n\nEntering the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] in Brazil, the U.S team won all three friendly \"send-off\" matches leading up to the competition: 2\u20130, over [[Azerbaijan national football team|Azerbaijan]], 2\u20131, over [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]], and 2\u20131 over fellow World Cup participant and defending [[Africa Cup of Nations|African]] champions [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]]. They were led at the time by [[J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann]], who helped lead West Germany to victory in the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]] and was the first player to score at least three goals in three consecutive World Cups.\n\nDuring the 2014 FIFA World Cup, the U.S. won their first match against Ghana, 2\u20131. [[Clint Dempsey]] scored in the first minute of the match giving the U.S. the early lead. Ghana did not respond until the 82nd minute scoring the equalizer goal. The U.S. then reclaimed the lead, thanks to [[John Anthony Brooks|John Brooks]] scoring the game-winning goal off his head just four minutes later in the 86th minute to regain the lead and take the match. The U.S. gained three points for their win and was off to a great start in the \"[[Group of Death]]\" claimed by critics for the teams the U.S. would have to go through in [[2014 FIFA World Cup Group G|Group G]] ([[Germany national football team|Germany]], [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]], and [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]]).\n\nThe second match of the World Cup for the U.S. was a different story. Portugal claimed the early lead, with [[Nani]] scoring in the 5th minute to take the early 1\u20130 lead. It wasn't till the 64th minute till the U.S. scored the equalizing goal, thanks to [[Jermaine Jones]], tying the match at 1 apiece. The U.S. then claimed the lead on a goal by Clint Dempsey again, scoring in the 81st minute to take a 2\u20131 lead. However, in the final minute of extra time, the world player of the year, [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] drilled a perfect cross to teammate [[Silvestre Varela]] who headed in the tying goal, making the final score 2\u20132. The tie gave each team a point in the overall standings, bringing the U.S. to 4 points total, and gave Portugal their first point of the World Cup having lost their opening match to Germany, 4\u20130. The U.S. claimed a spot in the knockout round in spite of a 1\u20130 loss to eventual champion Germany in their final [[2014 FIFA World Cup Group G|Group G]] game due to them winning the tiebreaker with Portugal. However, they bowed out the tournament in the round of 16 in a 2\u20131 loss to [[2014 FIFA World Cup Group H|Group H]] winner [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]]. Goalkeeper [[Tim Howard]] helped the U.S. keep a 0\u20130 tie at full time. In extra time, there were two Belgian goals. The U.S. struck back with a goal by 19-year-old phenom [[Julian Green]] but could not manage another goal. [[J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann]] was let go after he has been fired as USMNT Director of Coaching and was replaced by Bruce Arena in November 2016.\n\nThe U.S. finished in fifth place in the [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 CONCACAF Fifth Round|Final round]] of the [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONCACAF)|CONCACAF qualifying]] for the spot of the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], which concluded in October 2017.

During their tournament run, the women's national team established a new level of popularity for the women's game, culminating in a final against [[China women's national football team|China]] that drew 90,185 fans, an all-time attendance record for a women's sports event, to a sold-out [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]]. After neither team scored in regulation or extra time, the final went to a [[penalty shootout (football)|penalty shootout]], which the United States won 5\u20134.

Though organized locally by organizations all over the United States, there are two main youth soccer organizations working nationwide through affiliated local associations. The [[United States Youth Soccer Association]] boasts over three million players between the ages of five and 19, while [[American Youth Soccer Organization]] has more than 300,000 players between the ages of four and 19. This makes soccer one of the most played sports by children in the United States.\n\n===Men===\n{{further|Major League Soccer|North American Soccer League|United Soccer League|USL Championship|USL League One|USL League Two}}\nThe professional first-division league in North America is [[Major League Soccer]], which as of the 2020 season has 23 teams in the U.S. and 3 in Canada. The league began an aggressive expansion in 2017, with the goal of adding at least eight clubs but ultimately adding 10. The expansion saw the following clubs added: [[Atlanta United FC]] (2017), [[Minnesota United FC]] (2017), [[Los Angeles FC]] (2018), [[FC Cincinnati]] (2019), [[Inter Miami CF]] (2020), [[Nashville SC (MLS)|Nashville SC]] (2020), [[Austin FC]] (2021), [[Charlotte MLS team|Charlotte]] (2021), [[Sacramento Republic FC]] (2022) and [[St. Louis MLS team|St. Louis]] (2022). The league operates as a single-entity league, which means MLS, and not the individual teams, holds the contracts on players.\n\nThe one sanctioned second-division men's outdoor soccer league is the [[USL Championship]] (USLC). Previously, the second [[North American Soccer League]] had second-division status, sharing it with the USL in the 2017 season, but the NASL was denied second-division sanctioning for 2018 due to considerable instability in the league;<ref>{{cite web| url=http://fiftyfive.one/2017/09/us-soccer-federation-rejects-nasls-division-ii-application/|title=US Soccer Federation Rejects NASL's Division II Application |date= September 5, 2017}}</ref> the league effectively folded at that time.\n\nThe USLC was sanctioned as the United States' lone Division II men's outdoor soccer league in 2018. Formed in 2010 as a result of the merger of the former [[USL First Division]] and [[USL Second Division]], the USL Championship was sanctioned as Division III league from 2011 to 2016 before becoming provisionally sanctioned as a Division II league for 2017,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.si.com/planet-futbol/2017/01/06/us-soccer-division-two-sanctioning-usl-nasl |title=U.S. Soccer grants provisional division two sanctioning to both NASL, USL |last=Straus |first=Brian |date=January 6, 2017 |work=Sports Illustrated }}</ref> and receiving full Division II sanctioning in 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/90minutes/mls/ct-90mins-us-soccer-grants-usl-2nd-division-status-20180117-story.html |title=US Soccer grants USL 2nd-division status |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=January 17, 2018}}</ref> \n\nThe USL Championship has expanded almost three-fold since its first season in 2011 to include 35 teams in the 2020 season, with the league divided into two conferences, Eastern and Western. The USLC is the world's largest Division II professional league by number of teams. Since 2014, valuation of USL Championship clubs have increased five-fold. In revenue, 2018 Championship clubs saw a 28% increase over 2017 numbers on an average of ticketing, sponsorship, merchandise, and ancillary revenue generation.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe USLC also holds a broadcast agreement with ESPN that sees 20 regular season games televised nationally on ESPN2, ESPNews and ESPN Deportes<ref>https://www.uslsoccer.com/news_article/show/1044596</ref> in addition to national broadcast of the USL Championship Final, which in 2019 was aired on both ESPN2 and ESPN Deportes. The league's remaining regular season games are broadcast nationally on ESPN+, with 22 of the Championship's clubs also holding local broadcast agreements. The USL Championship's broadcast agreement was made possible in large part by a major investment by USL with league technology partner Vista Worldlink<ref>https://www.uslsoccer.com/news_article/show/751106-vista-usl-productions-form-cutting-edge-initiative</ref> to establish a USL Broadcast Center out of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.<ref>https://www.sportsvideo.org/2017/04/21/vista-worldlink-goes-all-in-on-at-home-production-with-overhauled-facility/</ref>\n\nThe second NASL had no official tie to the [[North American Soccer League (1968\u20131984)|former NASL]] that operated from 1968 to 1984, although some of the teams shared names with their historic counterparts. Unlike MLS that is a single-entity operation, the second NASL, like the old NASL, had no salary cap and players were contracted by the individual teams.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.nasl.com/media-guide/2011/Media%20Guide_Final_11-07-2011_book.pdf |title=NASL 2011 Media Guide |date=November 7, 2011}}</ref> The season was a split format (similar to that of [[Apertura and Clausura|many leagues in Latin America]]) that features seven teams, including one [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] team. Previous to the reorganization of the NASL in 2009, the [[USL First Division]] operated as the professional second-division league in the United States. However, a dispute among its teams and ownership led to the creation of the NASL which applied for and was awarded by USSF second division status.

Though League Two does have some paid players, it also has many teams that are made up entirely or almost entirely of [[college soccer]] players who use the league as an opportunity to play competitive soccer in front of professional scouts during the summer, while retaining amateur status and NCAA eligibility. Other fourth-division leagues in the United States are the [[United Premier Soccer League]], [[National Premier Soccer League]] and [[Ligas Unidas]].{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nIn addition to MLS and the USL, the [[United States Adult Soccer Association]] governs amateur soccer competition for adults throughout the United States, which is effectively the amateur fifth-division of soccer in the United States. The USASA sanctions regional tournaments that allow entry into the [[U.S. Open Cup]], the oldest continuous national soccer competition in the United States.

WPS launched with seven teams, all based in the United States. The Sol folded after the league's inaugural season, and two new teams joined for 2010, bringing WPS to eight teams. However, the 2010 season saw considerable instability, with another charter team, [[Saint Louis Athletica]], folding during the season, champions [[FC Gold Pride]] folding after the season, and the [[Chicago Red Stars]] deciding to regroup in the second-tier [[Women's Premier Soccer League]] (WPSL). The 2011 season, in which six teams based along the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] played, was marked by low attendance for most of the season and conflict with [[Dan Borislow]], who had purchased the former [[Washington Freedom]], moved the team to [[Miami metropolitan area|South Florida]], and renamed it [[MagicJack (WPS)|magicJack]]. The dispute between WPS and Borislow led the league to suspend the magicJack franchise, with Borislow responding by suing.

The second semi saw [[Usain Bolt]] run 19.78, in the last few metres [[Andre De Grasse]] rushed up to Bolt's shoulder, the two friends looking at each other and laughing as they crossed the line.  Bolt's time was his fastest the year and De Grasse set a new Canadian record of 19.80 seconds.  As [[Bud Winter]] the sprint coach who influenced [[Glen Mills]], Bolt's coach, would say; \"Relax and win.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.locomotivation.co.nz/steves-blog/archives/08-2015|title=Blog Archives|author=|date=|website=Locomotivation}}</ref>   Both the time qualifiers [[Adam Gemili]] and [[Ramil Guliyev]] both came from this fastest of the three semi final heats.  #3 of the year, [[Ameer Webb]] was left behind.  In the third semi, [[Alonso Edward]] and [[Churandy Martina]] qualified in 1st and 2nd place. World #2 in 2016 [[Justin Gatlin]] held the lead with 50 metres to go but he did not keep up his speed sufficiently. [[Alonso Edward]] as he pulled ahead of Gatlin and on the far outside, [[Churandy Martina]] closed fast to take the second qualifying position.  Gatlin failed to reach the final. 2012 silver medallist and number #2 runner of all time, [[Yohan Blake]] finished sixth.\n\nThe final was held following a light rainstorm that affected the women's javelin throw.  The track was still wet and conditions cooler.  Still the stadium was electric to see lightning, the star Usain Bolt in what was expected to be his last individual race in the Olympics.  Bolt was in lane 6, playing to the camera and to the crowd before the race.  Lemaitre and Martina were to his outside.  Bolt got a good start and quickly made up the stagger on Lemaitre then Martina  barely halfway through the turn.  Inside of him, DeGrasse got out well in lane 4 while Merritt lagged in 5.  As the stagger began to resolve near the end of the turn, Bolt held a two-metre lead over a wall of chasers.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/36690965|title= Rio Olympics 2016: Usain Bolt wins 200m gold, his eighth Olympic gold|date=19 August 2016|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=19 August 2016}}</ref>\t\t\nMartina held a slight edge on DeGrasse and Edward inside of him in lane 3 who were barely ahead of Merritt and Gemili, with Lemaitre slightly behind.  Bolt was 9.9 at the half way mark.  Down the home stretch, Bolt was working hard, his face showing the strain.  Behind him, DeGrasse was starting to separate from the row of contenders.  Only Guliyev was beaten.  As they approached the finish Edwards and Merritt faded.  Bolt had a 3-metre gap over DeGrasse, another metre and a half back, Lemaitre, Gemili, and Martina hit the finish line together.  The [[photo finish]] revealed Lemaitre to be the bronze medalist, with only six thousandths of a second separating the three runners.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/18/usain-bolt-jamaica-200m-gold-medal-olympic-rio-2016|title= Usain Bolt's dominant victory in Rio 200m final makes it eight Olympic gold|date=19 August 2016|work=Guardian|accessdate=19 August 2016}}</ref>\t\t\n\nBolt's winning time equalled his time from the semi-final he was joking around in.

The US team entries were the three fastest that season in [[400 metres]] specialist [[LaShawn Merritt]], 2015 World runner-up and American champion [[Justin Gatlin]] and  [[Ameer Webb]]. The Canadian team was [[Brendon Rodney]], [[Aaron Brown (sprinter)|Aaron Brown]] and [[Andre De Grasse]]. Bolt's training partner [[Miguel Francis]] and Britain's [[Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake]] were the other athletes to have run under 20 seconds that season. The Jamaican team also featured 2012 Olympic runner-up [[Yohan Blake]].<ref>Landells, Steve (2016-08-10).

The second semi saw [[Usain Bolt]] run 19.78, in the last few metres [[Andre De Grasse]] rushed up to Bolt's shoulder, the two friends looking at each other and laughing as they crossed the line.  Bolt's time was his fastest the year and De Grasse set a new Canadian record of 19.80 seconds.  As [[Bud Winter]] the sprint coach who influenced [[Glen Mills]], Bolt's coach, would say; \"Relax and win.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.locomotivation.co.nz/steves-blog/archives/08-2015|title=Blog Archives|author=|date=|website=Locomotivation}}</ref>   Both the time qualifiers [[Adam Gemili]] and [[Ramil Guliyev]] both came from this fastest of the three semi final heats.  #3 of the year, [[Ameer Webb]] was left behind.  In the third semi, [[Alonso Edward]] and [[Churandy Martina]] qualified in 1st and 2nd place. World #2 in 2016 [[Justin Gatlin]] held the lead with 50 metres to go but he did not keep up his speed sufficiently. [[Alonso Edward]] as he pulled ahead of Gatlin and on the far outside, [[Churandy Martina]] closed fast to take the second qualifying position.  Gatlin failed to reach the final. 2012 silver medallist and number #2 runner of all time, [[Yohan Blake]] finished sixth.\n\nThe final was held following a light rainstorm that affected the women's javelin throw.  The track was still wet and conditions cooler.  Still the stadium was electric to see lightning, the star Usain Bolt in what was expected to be his last individual race in the Olympics.  Bolt was in lane 6, playing to the camera and to the crowd before the race.  Lemaitre and Martina were to his outside.  Bolt got a good start and quickly made up the stagger on Lemaitre then Martina  barely halfway through the turn.  Inside of him, DeGrasse got out well in lane 4 while Merritt lagged in 5.  As the stagger began to resolve near the end of the turn, Bolt held a two-metre lead over a wall of chasers.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/36690965|title= Rio Olympics 2016: Usain Bolt wins 200m gold, his eighth Olympic gold|date=19 August 2016|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=19 August 2016}}</ref>\t\t\nMartina held a slight edge on DeGrasse and Edward inside of him in lane 3 who were barely ahead of Merritt and Gemili, with Lemaitre slightly behind.  Bolt was 9.9 at the half way mark.  Down the home stretch, Bolt was working hard, his face showing the strain.  Behind him, DeGrasse was starting to separate from the row of contenders.  Only Guliyev was beaten.  As they approached the finish Edwards and Merritt faded.  Bolt had a 3-metre gap over DeGrasse, another metre and a half back, Lemaitre, Gemili, and Martina hit the finish line together.  The [[photo finish]] revealed Lemaitre to be the bronze medalist, with only six thousandths of a second separating the three runners.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/18/usain-bolt-jamaica-200m-gold-medal-olympic-rio-2016|title= Usain Bolt's dominant victory in Rio 200m final makes it eight Olympic gold|date=19 August 2016|work=Guardian|accessdate=19 August 2016}}</ref>\t\t\n\nBolt's winning time equalled his time from the semi-final he was joking around in.  DeGrasse and most of the field was more than 2 tenths of a second slower than the night before.\n\nAfter the race, Bolt celebrated his last individual victory, kissing the finish line and doing the lightning bolt.\n\nIn the victory ceremony, the medals for the competition were presented by Sir [[Philip Craven]], Great Britain, member of the [[International Olympic Committee]] and president of the [[International Paralympic Committee]], and the gifts were presented by [[Adille Sumariwalla]], Council Member of the [[International Association of Athletics Federations|IAAF]].\n\n==Records==\nBefore this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows.\n\n{{World Olympic Record\n| world_athlete   = {{flagathlete|[[Usain Bolt]]|JAM}}\n| world_mark      = 19.19\n| world_place     = [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]\n| world_date      = 20 August 2009\n| world_ref       = \n| olympic_athlete = {{flagIOCathlete|[[Usain Bolt]]|JAM|2008 Summer}}\n| olympic_mark    = 19.30\n| olympic_place   = [[Beijing]], [[China]]\n| olympic_date    = 20 August 2008\n| olympic_ref     = \n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
