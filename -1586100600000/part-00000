Chiesa sought Craxi's protection for nearly a month; but Craxi accused him of casting a shadow on the \"most honest party in Italy.\" Feeling marginalised and unjustly singled-out, Chiesa divulged everything he knew to the prosecutors. His revelations brought half of the [[Milan]] Socialists and [[Industrialists]] under investigation; even Paolo Pillitteri, Craxi's own brother-in-law and mayor of Milan, was investigated despite his parliamentary immunity. As a consequence, a team of Milanese judges began investigating specifically the party's financing system.\n\nIn July 1992, Craxi finally realised the situation was serious and that he himself was going to be hit by the unfolding scandal. He made an appeal before the [[Chamber of Deputies]] in which he claimed that everyone knew of the widespread irregularities in the public financing of Italian parties, accused the deputies of hypocrisy and cowardice, and called for all MPs to protect the Socialists from prosecution as a show of solidarity. However, his call was ignored.\n\nCraxi received his first prosecution notice in December 1992. More followed in January and February, at which point the Court of Milan explicitly asked Parliament to authorise Craxi's prosecution for bribery and corruption (at the time, Italian MPs were immune from prosecution unless authorised by Parliament). The authorisation was denied on 29 April 1993 after Craxi gave an emotional speech. However, upon coming out of the Hotel Raphael, where he lived, he received a salvo of coins that members of the [[Democratic Party of the Left]] and the right-wing [[Italian Social Movement]] threw at him as a sign of their disgust. They started to jump and sing: \"He who does not jump is a Socialist!\" (from a traditional stadium chant). Some of the students waved 1,000-[[Italian lira|lire]] bills, singing ''Bettino, do you want these too?'' (''Bettino, vuoi pure queste?'') to the tune of [[Guantanamera]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k00U-N73oE] The video of the mob against Craxi on Youtube</ref>\n\n===Facing the judges===\nIn December 1993, after his prosecution was finally authorised, Craxi was called to testify alongside [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Democrazia Cristiana]] party secretary [[Arnaldo Forlani]] before Justice [[Antonio Di Pietro]]. Questions were asked about the so-called ENIMONT 'super-bribe' which the PSI and DC had jointly received and democratically shared. Forlani evasively asked what a bribe was while Craxi, after admitting to the charges brought against himself and other parties, stated that the bribes were \"the cost of politics.\" Craxi, noting that the legal process had accelerated in his case, claimed that his prosecution was politically motivated.\n\nIn May 1994 he fled to [[Tunis]] in order to escape jail. His political career ended in less than two years. Italy's entire political class, including people like Andreotti and Forlani, was to follow suit soon.\n\nThe CAF (the Craxi-Andreotti-Forlani axis), which had made a pact to revive the Pentapartito (an alliance of five parties: DC, PSI, Italian Republican Party, Italian Liberal Party, Italian Democratic Socialist Party) of the 1980s and apply it to the 1990s, was doomed to be crushed by the popular vote as well as by the judges.\n\nThe set of anti-corruption investigations carried out by the Milan judges came to be collectively called [[Mani pulite]] (''clean hands''). No party was spared, but in some parties corruption had become more endemic than elsewhere (either because of more opportunity or internal ethics). To this day, some people (especially those who were close to Craxi) argue that some parties (such as the [[Italian Communist Party]]) were left untouched, while the leaders of then ruling coalition (and in particular Bettino Craxi) were wiped off the political map.\n\nThe judges in Milan were put under scrutiny several times by different governments (especially [[Silvio Berlusconi]]'s first government in 1994), but no evidence of any misconduct was ever found. Furthermore, public opinion was much less concerned about foreign financing than about the misappropriation of their money by corrupt politicians.\n\nIn the end, the Socialist party went from 14% of the vote to a virtual nil. An ironic note was that the disgraced remnant of the party was excluded from Parliament by the minimum 4% threshold introduced by Bettino Craxi himself during one of his previous governments.\n\nAs mentioned before, during the \"Mani pulite\" period Craxi tried to use a daring defence tactic: he maintained that all parties needed and took money illegally, however they could get it, to finance their activities. His defence was therefore not to declare himself innocent, but everybody guilty. While this was basically the truth, most citizens distrusted politicians, and Craxi's defence got no sympathy by the citizens and may have even served to enrage them further. Some bribes didn't go to the parties at all. They went to the personal wallets of the politician who happened to take them.\n\nIn 2012, Di Pietro admitted that Craxi was right when during the [[Mani pulite|process Enimont]] he accused [[Italian Communist Party]] to have received illegal funding from the [[Soviet Union]]. Craxi's sentences seemed to him \"criminally relevant\", but Di Pietro omitted to investigate that crime.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corriereweb.net/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=26851:%E2%80%9Csu-napolitano-aveva-ragione-craxi%E2%80%9D-tonino-ci-ripensa-vent%E2%80%99anni-dopo-la-figlia-del-leader-socialista-%E2%80%9Ce%E2%80%99-un-imbecille%E2%80%9D&device=iphone|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130221124220/http://www.corriereweb.net/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=26851:%E2%80%9Csu-napolitano-aveva-ragione-craxi%E2%80%9D-tonino-ci-ripensa-vent%E2%80%99anni-dopo-la-figlia-del-leader-socialista-%E2%80%9Ce%E2%80%99-un-imbecille%E2%80%9D&device=iphone|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-02-21|author=Corriereweb|title=Su Napolitano aveva ragione Craxi|language=it}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/interni/pietro-ora-d-ragione-craxi-napolitano-era-soldo-mosca-828160.html|author=Il Giornale|title=Di Pietro ora d\u00e0 ragione a Craxi|language=it}}</ref>\n\n===Critics to his lifestyle===\n[[File:Craxi22.jpg|thumb|right|Electoral posters of the Socialist Party showing only a portrait of Craxi]]\nCraxi's lifestyle was perceived to be inappropriate for the secretary of a party with so many alleged financial problems: he lived in the Raphael, an expensive hotel in Rome's centre, and had a large villa in [[Hammamet, Tunisia|Hammamet]], Tunisia. As the [[Mani Pulite]] investigations were to uncover in the 1990s, personal corruption was endemic in Italian society; while many politicians, including Craxi, would justify corruption with the necessities of a democracy, political leaders at many levels enjoyed a lifestyle that should have been well out of their reach, while most parties continued having financial problems. [[Rino Formica]], a prominent member of the Socialist Party in those years, wittily said that \"the convent is poor, but the friars are rich\".\n\nFurthermore, Craxi's arrogant character won him many enemies; one of his most condemned actions was blaming corruption in the socialist party on treasurer Vincenzo Balzamo, just after the latter's death, in order to clear himself of any accusation. He also had controversial friends, such as [[Siad Barre]], dictator of [[Somalia]], [[Yasser Arafat]], leader of [[PLO]], and [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali|Ben Ali]], dictator of [[Tunisia]]. The latter provided protection to Craxi when he escaped from Italy.\n\nCraxi's entourage was famously criticised by Formica as a \"court of midgets and dancers\" (''corte di nani e ballerine''), indicating the often ludicrous and immoral traits of a system based on personal acquaintance rather than merit. Among the friends of Craxi's to receive smaller and larger favours, [[Silvio Berlusconi]] is perhaps the most known: he received many favours, especially regarding his media empire, and had a decree named after him (\"Decreto Berlusconi\") long before he entered politics. Other figures were Craxi's mistresses [[Ania Pieroni]], who owned a TV station in the Rome area, and [[Sandra Milo]], who had a skyrocketing career in the state-owned TV channels [[RAI]].\n\nCraxi was also known for never apologising, as a matter of principle; most Italians expected an apology after the corrupt system had been exposed. Craxi never apologised, stating he had done nothing that everybody else had not been doing, and that he was being unjustly singled out and persecuted.\n\n=== Judgements of European Court of human rights===\nAll three appeals by Craxi to [[Strasbourg]] Court complained that his defense was not able to refute in court the accusations made by various defendants of related crimes, in violation of the adversarial principle proclaimed in article 6 paragraph 3 letter d of the European Convention of Human Rights.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title= Commento alla decisione della Corte europea dei diritti dell'uomo dell'11 ottobre 2001 |journal=Diritto&Giustizia Edizione Online|date=2001| url= https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89309227}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}</ref> The European Court ruled in his favor once, in the case of wiretapped conversations illegally made public.\n\n==Decline and dissolution of the Socialist Party==\nBettino Craxi resigned as party Secretary in February 1993. Between 1992 and 1993, most members of the party left politics and three Socialist deputies committed suicide. Craxi was succeeded by two Socialist trade-unionists, first [[Giorgio Benvenuto]] and then by [[Ottaviano Del Turco]]. In the December 1993 provincial and municipal elections the PSI was virtually wiped out, receiving around 3% of the vote. In Milan, where the PSI had won 20% in 1990, the PSI received a mere 2%, which was not even enough to elect a councillor. Del Turco tried in vain to regain credibility for the party.\n\nIn the [[1994 Italian general election|1994 general election]], what was left of PSI allied itself to the [[Alliance of Progressives]] dominated by the [[Post-Communism|post-communist]] incarnation of the PCI, the [[Democratic Party of the Left]] (PDS). Del Turco had quickly changed the party symbol to reinforce the idea of innovation. However, this did not stop the PSI gaining only 2.2% of the votes compared to 13.6% in 1992. The PSI got 16 deputies<ref>They were Giuseppe Albertini, [[Enrico Boselli]], [[Carlo Carli (Italian politician)|Carlo Carli]], [[Ottaviano Del Turco]], Fabio Di Capua, Vittorio Emiliani, Mario Gatto, Luigi Giacco, [[Gino Giugni]], Alberto La Volpe, Vincenzo Mattina, Valerio Mignone, [[Rosario Olivo]], Corrado Paoloni, [[Giuseppe Pericu]] and [[Valdo Spini]].</ref> and 14 senators<ref>They were Paolo Bagnoli, Orietta Baldelli, Francesco Barra, Luigi Biscardi, Guido De Martino, Gianni Fardin, Carlo Gubbini, Maria Rosaria Manieri, Cesare Marini, Maria Antonia Modolo, Michele Sellitti, Giancarlo Tapparo, Antonino Valletta and Antonio Vozzi.</ref> elected, down from 92 deputies and 49 senators of 1992. Most of them came from the left-wing of the party, as Del Turco himself did. Most Socialists joined other political forces, mainly [[Forza Italia]], the new party led by [[Silvio Berlusconi]], the [[Patto Segni]] and [[Democratic Alliance (Italy)|Democratic Alliance]].\n\nThe party was disbanded on 13 November 1994 after two years of agony, in which almost all of its longtime leaders, especially Bettino Craxi, were involved in Tangentopoli and decided to leave politics. The 100-year-old party closed down, partially thanks to its leaders for their personalisation of the PSI.\n\n==Craxism==\n{{main|Craxism}}\n[[File:Bettino Craxi 2.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Craxi during 1980s]]\n''Craxism'' ([[italian language|ita]]: ''Craxismo'') was and is according to some extant, an Italian political ideology based on Craxi's thought. It was informal ideology of the Socialist Party from 1976 to 1994.\n\n===Origins and features===\nCraxism, although the term is considered derogatory today, was based on a synthesis of social democracy, socialism and social liberalism. In fact, if on one side the PSI under Craxi is required with a strong [[third-worldism]], Pro-[[Arabs|Arabian]]ism, [[environmentalism]] and a modern [[welfare state]] system (typical of the [[centre-left|modern left]]), on the other hand was strongly pro-[[atlanticism|Atlanticist]] and pro-[[europeanism|europeanist]] and placed on a strong defense of territorial sovereignty (e.g. \"Sigonella crisis\" American armed forces) and on [[conservative]] policies on issues such as [[abortion]] and [[war on drugs]].\n\nUnder Craxi, PSI moved from [[left-wing]] to centre-left, much to ally with the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]] and other moderate parties that formed a coalition called ''[[Pentapartito]]'', which ensured a stable majority to govern.\n\n===Critics===\nToday, Craxism is often considered a derogatory term describing a corrupt politician, although some welcome him in a favourable manner: this is the case of those who, following the dissolution of the PSI, joined the newly formed [[Forza Italia]] of [[Silvio Berlusconi]] ([[centre-right]]), but also a part of those who formed the [[Italian Socialists]], small party adhering to the [[Alliance of progressives]] of [[Achille Occhetto]] (centre-left).\n\nFinally, Craxism has led to the change of the whole of [[Party of European Socialists|European socialism]], together with [[Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez]] ([[Spanish Socialist Worker's Party|PSOE]]), [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] ([[Socialist Party (France)|PS]]), and [[Helmut Schmidt]] ([[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]), during all of the 1980s; In addition, along with these other figures, inspired the overhaul and the policies of [[Tony Blair]]'s [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], the [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero|Jos\u00e9 Zapatero]]'s PSOE and the [[Andreas Papandreou]]'s [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement|PASOK]].\n\nIn Italy, the main critics of Craxism as well as the figure of Craxi are the former [[Communist]]s (including most members of the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]]) and some media left-wing press (''[[Il Fatto Quotidiano]]'', ''[[il manifesto]]'', ''[[L'Espresso]]'' and ''[[la Repubblica]]'') while the biggest supporters are the [[Italian Socialist Party (2007)|Italian Socialist Party]] of [[Riccardo Nencini]] and various politicians of [[The People of Freedom]] and the centre-right as Silvio Berlusconi (also ex-Socialist), [[Renato Brunetta]], [[Maurizio Sacconi]], Stefano Caldoro and [[Stefania Craxi]], Bettino's daughter.\n\n==Death and legacy==\n[[File:Hammamet, tombe de Bettino Craxi.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Craxi's grave in [[Hammamet, Tunisia|Hammamet]], Tunisia]]\nAll this resulted in him being considered the symbol of [[political corruption]]. Bettino Craxi escaped the laws he had once contributed to make, by fleeing to [[Hammamet, Tunisia]], in 1994, and remained a fugitive there, protected by [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali|Ben Ali]]'s government, who was a personal friend of Craxi. He repeatedly declared himself innocent, but never returned to Italy where he had been sentenced to 27 years in jail because of his corruption crimes (of these, 9 years and 8 months were upheld on appeal).\n\nCraxi died on 19 January 2000, at the age of 65, from complications of [[diabetes]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/610659.stm|title=Craxi: Fallen kingpin|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=20 January 2000|accessdate=13 April 2013}}</ref> The then Prime Minister and [[Democrats of the Left]] leader, [[Massimo D'Alema]], proposed a state funeral, but his proposal was not accepted by Craxi's own family, who accused the then government of preventing Craxi to return to Italy to undergo a delicate surgery at the [[San Raffaele Hospital]] in Milan.\n\nCraxi's funeral took place at the [[Cathedral of St. Vincent de Paul]] in Tunis and saw a large participation of the indigenous population. Former PSI militants and other Italians arrived in Tunisia to make the last greetings to their leaders. His supporters came outside the Tunisian cathedral and targeted by insults and a launch of coins the representatives of the Italian government, [[Lamberto Dini]] and [[Marco Minniti]].<ref>[http://www.repubblica.it/online/politica/craxi1/hammamet2/hammamet2.html Craxi, l'ultimo saluto.

In 1963 he was appointed leader of the Milan Provincial Secretariat of the PSI and in 1965 Craxi became a member of the National Leadership.

Nel 1970 after the end of the PSU alliance, Craxi became Vice Secretary of the PSI, as proposed by [[Giacomo Mancini]].\n\nDuring this period he was a strong supporters of the [[Organic Centre-left]] coalition, between the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrats]] of [[Aldo Moro]] and [[Amintore Fanfani]], the Socialists of [[Pietro Nenni]], the [[Italian Social Democratic Party|Social Democrats]] of [[Giuseppe Saragat]] and the [[Italian Republican Party|Republicans]] of [[Ugo La Malfa]].<ref>[http://www.repubblica.it/online/politica/craxi1/scheda/scheda.html L'era di Craxi, in 16 anni dagli altari alla polvere]</ref>\n\nIn 1972 with the re-election of [[Francesco De Martino]] as National Secretary of the Socialist Party during the [[Genoa]] Congress, Craxi was confirmed with Giovanni Mosca in the role of Deputy Secretary, receiving the commission to treat the international relations of the party. As representative of PSI at the [[Socialist International]], Craxi formed ties with some of the main European future leaders, like [[Willy Brandt]], [[Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]], [[M\u00e1rio Soares]], [[Michel Rocard]] and [[Andreas Papandreou]].<ref>[http://scienzepolitiche.unipg.it/tutor/uploads/craxi.ppt Craxi e il PSI]</ref>\n\nAs responsible of the PSI foreign policy he supported, also financially, some socialist parties banned by the dictatorships of their respective countries, including the [[Spanish Socialist Workers Party]], the [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] and the [[Chilean Socialist Party]] of [[Salvador Allende]], of whom Craxi was a personal friend.<ref>[https://archive.is/20130706133127/http://www.agenziaaise.it/regioni/rapporti-internazionali/54620-conferito-il-.html?quot;premio-salvador-allende=&quot;-alla= Conferito il premio Salvador Allende alla memoria di Bettino Craxi]</ref>\n\n==Secretary of the Socialist Party==\nIn 1976 the Secretary [[Francesco De Martino]] wrote an article in the Socialist newspaper ''[[Avanti!]]'' that caused the fall of the government [[Aldo Moro]] and the subsequent [[1976 Italian general election|snap election]], which saw an impressive growth of the [[Italian Communist Party]] led by a young leader, [[Enrico Berlinguer]], while the Christian Democracy managed to remain the majority party on just a few votes. Instead for the PSI those elections were a crushing defeat: the votes went down under the threshold of 10%.

However, he was able to consolidate power and implement his policies. In particular, he sought and managed to distance the party from the Communists, bringing it into an alliance with Christian Democracy and other centrist parties, while maintaining a leftist and reformist profile.<ref>[http://www.lintellettualedissidente.it/homines/bettino-craxi/ Bettino Craxi \u2013 L'intellettuale dissidente]</ref>\n\nCraxi always opposed the [[Historic Compromise]] policy of Moro and Berlinguer, a political alliance and an accommodation between the Christian Democrats and the Communists; the alliance would inevitably made it politically irrelevant the Socialists. He outlined for a line of alternation between the DC and the left-wing, represented by his party, due to the close relations between the PCI and the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>''A new band of brothers''.

He chose a red [[carnation]] to represent the new course of the party, in honour of the [[Carnation Revolution]] in [[Portugal]]. The party shrank the size of the old hammer and sickle in the lower part of the symbol.

This led to the constant formation of political alliances between parties keen on keeping the Communists at bay. Things were further complicated by the fact that many parties had internal currents that would have welcomed the Communists in the governing coalition, in particular, within Christian Democracy, the largest party in Italy from 1945 until the end of the [[History of Italy as a Republic#The First Republic|First Republic]].<ref>[http://www.150storiaditalia.it/it/approfondimento/bettino-craxi-e-lasse-con-la-dc/ Bettino Craxi e l'asse con la DC]</ref>\n\n===Domestic policy===\nDuring Craxi's tenure as Prime Minister, Italy became the fifth largest industrial nation and gained entry into the [[G7]] Group of most industrialised nations.<ref>[http://noisefromamerika.org/articolo/conseguenze-economiche-bettino-craxi Le conseguenze economiche di Craxi]</ref> However, inflation was often in the double digits.

In any event, the victory of the \"No\" campaign in the referendum called by the [[Italian Communist Party]] was a major victory for Craxi. During his premiership the Socialist Party gained popularity. He successfully boosted the country's  [[Measures of national income and output#Gross National Product|GNP]] and controlled  [[inflation]].<ref>[https://www.panorama.it/cultura/libri/30-anni-scala-mobile/ Il libro che racconta di Craxi e di quando tagli\u00f2 la scala mobile]</ref><ref>[http://www.raistoria.rai.it/articoli-programma-puntate/la-scala-mobile/30036/default.aspx La scala mobile]</ref>\n\n[[File:Giulio Andreotti e Bettino Craxi.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Craxi with his Foreign Affairs Minister and Christian Democratic leader [[Giulio Andreotti]]]]\nIn domestic policy, a number of reforms were initiated during Craxi's time in office.

Chiesa sought Craxi's protection for nearly a month; but Craxi accused him of casting a shadow on the \"most honest party in Italy.\" Feeling marginalised and unjustly singled-out, Chiesa divulged everything he knew to the prosecutors. His revelations brought half of the [[Milan]] Socialists and [[Industrialists]] under investigation; even Paolo Pillitteri, Craxi's own brother-in-law and mayor of Milan, was investigated despite his parliamentary immunity. As a consequence, a team of Milanese judges began investigating specifically the party's financing system.\n\nIn July 1992, Craxi finally realised the situation was serious and that he himself was going to be hit by the unfolding scandal. He made an appeal before the [[Chamber of Deputies]] in which he claimed that everyone knew of the widespread irregularities in the public financing of Italian parties, accused the deputies of hypocrisy and cowardice, and called for all MPs to protect the Socialists from prosecution as a show of solidarity. However, his call was ignored.\n\nCraxi received his first prosecution notice in December 1992. More followed in January and February, at which point the Court of Milan explicitly asked Parliament to authorise Craxi's prosecution for bribery and corruption (at the time, Italian MPs were immune from prosecution unless authorised by Parliament). The authorisation was denied on 29 April 1993 after Craxi gave an emotional speech. However, upon coming out of the Hotel Raphael, where he lived, he received a salvo of coins that members of the [[Democratic Party of the Left]] and the right-wing [[Italian Social Movement]] threw at him as a sign of their disgust. They started to jump and sing: \"He who does not jump is a Socialist!\" (from a traditional stadium chant). Some of the students waved 1,000-[[Italian lira|lire]] bills, singing ''Bettino, do you want these too?'' (''Bettino, vuoi pure queste?'') to the tune of [[Guantanamera]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k00U-N73oE] The video of the mob against Craxi on Youtube</ref>\n\n===Facing the judges===\nIn December 1993, after his prosecution was finally authorised, Craxi was called to testify alongside [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Democrazia Cristiana]] party secretary [[Arnaldo Forlani]] before Justice [[Antonio Di Pietro]]. Questions were asked about the so-called ENIMONT 'super-bribe' which the PSI and DC had jointly received and democratically shared. Forlani evasively asked what a bribe was while Craxi, after admitting to the charges brought against himself and other parties, stated that the bribes were \"the cost of politics.\" Craxi, noting that the legal process had accelerated in his case, claimed that his prosecution was politically motivated.\n\nIn May 1994 he fled to [[Tunis]] in order to escape jail. His political career ended in less than two years. Italy's entire political class, including people like Andreotti and Forlani, was to follow suit soon.\n\nThe CAF (the Craxi-Andreotti-Forlani axis), which had made a pact to revive the Pentapartito (an alliance of five parties: DC, PSI, Italian Republican Party, Italian Liberal Party, Italian Democratic Socialist Party) of the 1980s and apply it to the 1990s, was doomed to be crushed by the popular vote as well as by the judges.\n\nThe set of anti-corruption investigations carried out by the Milan judges came to be collectively called [[Mani pulite]] (''clean hands''). No party was spared, but in some parties corruption had become more endemic than elsewhere (either because of more opportunity or internal ethics). To this day, some people (especially those who were close to Craxi) argue that some parties (such as the [[Italian Communist Party]]) were left untouched, while the leaders of then ruling coalition (and in particular Bettino Craxi) were wiped off the political map.\n\nThe judges in Milan were put under scrutiny several times by different governments (especially [[Silvio Berlusconi]]'s first government in 1994), but no evidence of any misconduct was ever found. Furthermore, public opinion was much less concerned about foreign financing than about the misappropriation of their money by corrupt politicians.\n\nIn the end, the Socialist party went from 14% of the vote to a virtual nil. An ironic note was that the disgraced remnant of the party was excluded from Parliament by the minimum 4% threshold introduced by Bettino Craxi himself during one of his previous governments.\n\nAs mentioned before, during the \"Mani pulite\" period Craxi tried to use a daring defence tactic: he maintained that all parties needed and took money illegally, however they could get it, to finance their activities. His defence was therefore not to declare himself innocent, but everybody guilty. While this was basically the truth, most citizens distrusted politicians, and Craxi's defence got no sympathy by the citizens and may have even served to enrage them further. Some bribes didn't go to the parties at all. They went to the personal wallets of the politician who happened to take them.\n\nIn 2012, Di Pietro admitted that Craxi was right when during the [[Mani pulite|process Enimont]] he accused [[Italian Communist Party]] to have received illegal funding from the [[Soviet Union]]. Craxi's sentences seemed to him \"criminally relevant\", but Di Pietro omitted to investigate that crime.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corriereweb.net/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=26851:%E2%80%9Csu-napolitano-aveva-ragione-craxi%E2%80%9D-tonino-ci-ripensa-vent%E2%80%99anni-dopo-la-figlia-del-leader-socialista-%E2%80%9Ce%E2%80%99-un-imbecille%E2%80%9D&device=iphone|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130221124220/http://www.corriereweb.net/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=26851:%E2%80%9Csu-napolitano-aveva-ragione-craxi%E2%80%9D-tonino-ci-ripensa-vent%E2%80%99anni-dopo-la-figlia-del-leader-socialista-%E2%80%9Ce%E2%80%99-un-imbecille%E2%80%9D&device=iphone|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-02-21|author=Corriereweb|title=Su Napolitano aveva ragione Craxi|language=it}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/interni/pietro-ora-d-ragione-craxi-napolitano-era-soldo-mosca-828160.html|author=Il Giornale|title=Di Pietro ora d\u00e0 ragione a Craxi|language=it}}</ref>\n\n===Critics to his lifestyle===\n[[File:Craxi22.jpg|thumb|right|Electoral posters of the Socialist Party showing only a portrait of Craxi]]\nCraxi's lifestyle was perceived to be inappropriate for the secretary of a party with so many alleged financial problems: he lived in the Raphael, an expensive hotel in Rome's centre, and had a large villa in [[Hammamet, Tunisia|Hammamet]], Tunisia. As the [[Mani Pulite]] investigations were to uncover in the 1990s, personal corruption was endemic in Italian society; while many politicians, including Craxi, would justify corruption with the necessities of a democracy, political leaders at many levels enjoyed a lifestyle that should have been well out of their reach, while most parties continued having financial problems. [[Rino Formica]], a prominent member of the Socialist Party in those years, wittily said that \"the convent is poor, but the friars are rich\".\n\nFurthermore, Craxi's arrogant character won him many enemies; one of his most condemned actions was blaming corruption in the socialist party on treasurer Vincenzo Balzamo, just after the latter's death, in order to clear himself of any accusation. He also had controversial friends, such as [[Siad Barre]], dictator of [[Somalia]], [[Yasser Arafat]], leader of [[PLO]], and [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali|Ben Ali]], dictator of [[Tunisia]]. The latter provided protection to Craxi when he escaped from Italy.\n\nCraxi's entourage was famously criticised by Formica as a \"court of midgets and dancers\" (''corte di nani e ballerine''), indicating the often ludicrous and immoral traits of a system based on personal acquaintance rather than merit. Among the friends of Craxi's to receive smaller and larger favours, [[Silvio Berlusconi]] is perhaps the most known: he received many favours, especially regarding his media empire, and had a decree named after him (\"Decreto Berlusconi\") long before he entered politics. Other figures were Craxi's mistresses [[Ania Pieroni]], who owned a TV station in the Rome area, and [[Sandra Milo]], who had a skyrocketing career in the state-owned TV channels [[RAI]].\n\nCraxi was also known for never apologising, as a matter of principle; most Italians expected an apology after the corrupt system had been exposed. Craxi never apologised, stating he had done nothing that everybody else had not been doing, and that he was being unjustly singled out and persecuted.\n\n=== Judgements of European Court of human rights===\nAll three appeals by Craxi to [[Strasbourg]] Court complained that his defense was not able to refute in court the accusations made by various defendants of related crimes, in violation of the adversarial principle proclaimed in article 6 paragraph 3 letter d of the European Convention of Human Rights.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title= Commento alla decisione della Corte europea dei diritti dell'uomo dell'11 ottobre 2001 |journal=Diritto&Giustizia Edizione Online|date=2001| url= https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89309227}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}</ref> The European Court ruled in his favor once, in the case of wiretapped conversations illegally made public.\n\n==Decline and dissolution of the Socialist Party==\nBettino Craxi resigned as party Secretary in February 1993. Between 1992 and 1993, most members of the party left politics and three Socialist deputies committed suicide. Craxi was succeeded by two Socialist trade-unionists, first [[Giorgio Benvenuto]] and then by [[Ottaviano Del Turco]]. In the December 1993 provincial and municipal elections the PSI was virtually wiped out, receiving around 3% of the vote. In Milan, where the PSI had won 20% in 1990, the PSI received a mere 2%, which was not even enough to elect a councillor. Del Turco tried in vain to regain credibility for the party.\n\nIn the [[1994 Italian general election|1994 general election]], what was left of PSI allied itself to the [[Alliance of Progressives]] dominated by the [[Post-Communism|post-communist]] incarnation of the PCI, the [[Democratic Party of the Left]] (PDS). Del Turco had quickly changed the party symbol to reinforce the idea of innovation. However, this did not stop the PSI gaining only 2.2% of the votes compared to 13.6% in 1992. The PSI got 16 deputies<ref>They were Giuseppe Albertini, [[Enrico Boselli]], [[Carlo Carli (Italian politician)|Carlo Carli]], [[Ottaviano Del Turco]], Fabio Di Capua, Vittorio Emiliani, Mario Gatto, Luigi Giacco, [[Gino Giugni]], Alberto La Volpe, Vincenzo Mattina, Valerio Mignone, [[Rosario Olivo]], Corrado Paoloni, [[Giuseppe Pericu]] and [[Valdo Spini]].</ref> and 14 senators<ref>They were Paolo Bagnoli, Orietta Baldelli, Francesco Barra, Luigi Biscardi, Guido De Martino, Gianni Fardin, Carlo Gubbini, Maria Rosaria Manieri, Cesare Marini, Maria Antonia Modolo, Michele Sellitti, Giancarlo Tapparo, Antonino Valletta and Antonio Vozzi.</ref> elected, down from 92 deputies and 49 senators of 1992. Most of them came from the left-wing of the party, as Del Turco himself did. Most Socialists joined other political forces, mainly [[Forza Italia]], the new party led by [[Silvio Berlusconi]], the [[Patto Segni]] and [[Democratic Alliance (Italy)|Democratic Alliance]].\n\nThe party was disbanded on 13 November 1994 after two years of agony, in which almost all of its longtime leaders, especially Bettino Craxi, were involved in Tangentopoli and decided to leave politics. The 100-year-old party closed down, partially thanks to its leaders for their personalisation of the PSI.\n\n==Craxism==\n{{main|Craxism}}\n[[File:Bettino Craxi 2.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Craxi during 1980s]]\n''Craxism'' ([[italian language|ita]]: ''Craxismo'') was and is according to some extant, an Italian political ideology based on Craxi's thought. It was informal ideology of the Socialist Party from 1976 to 1994.\n\n===Origins and features===\nCraxism, although the term is considered derogatory today, was based on a synthesis of social democracy, socialism and social liberalism. In fact, if on one side the PSI under Craxi is required with a strong [[third-worldism]], Pro-[[Arabs|Arabian]]ism, [[environmentalism]] and a modern [[welfare state]] system (typical of the [[centre-left|modern left]]), on the other hand was strongly pro-[[atlanticism|Atlanticist]] and pro-[[europeanism|europeanist]] and placed on a strong defense of territorial sovereignty (e.g. \"Sigonella crisis\" American armed forces) and on [[conservative]] policies on issues such as [[abortion]] and [[war on drugs]].\n\nUnder Craxi, PSI moved from [[left-wing]] to centre-left, much to ally with the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]] and other moderate parties that formed a coalition called ''[[Pentapartito]]'', which ensured a stable majority to govern.\n\n===Critics===\nToday, Craxism is often considered a derogatory term describing a corrupt politician, although some welcome him in a favourable manner: this is the case of those who, following the dissolution of the PSI, joined the newly formed [[Forza Italia]] of [[Silvio Berlusconi]] ([[centre-right]]), but also a part of those who formed the [[Italian Socialists]], small party adhering to the [[Alliance of progressives]] of [[Achille Occhetto]] (centre-left).\n\nFinally, Craxism has led to the change of the whole of [[Party of European Socialists|European socialism]], together with [[Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez]] ([[Spanish Socialist Worker's Party|PSOE]]), [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] ([[Socialist Party (France)|PS]]), and [[Helmut Schmidt]] ([[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]), during all of the 1980s; In addition, along with these other figures, inspired the overhaul and the policies of [[Tony Blair]]'s [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], the [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero|Jos\u00e9 Zapatero]]'s PSOE and the [[Andreas Papandreou]]'s [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement|PASOK]].\n\nIn Italy, the main critics of Craxism as well as the figure of Craxi are the former [[Communist]]s (including most members of the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]]) and some media left-wing press (''[[Il Fatto Quotidiano]]'', ''[[il manifesto]]'', ''[[L'Espresso]]'' and ''[[la Repubblica]]'') while the biggest supporters are the [[Italian Socialist Party (2007)|Italian Socialist Party]] of [[Riccardo Nencini]] and various politicians of [[The People of Freedom]] and the centre-right as Silvio Berlusconi (also ex-Socialist), [[Renato Brunetta]], [[Maurizio Sacconi]], Stefano Caldoro and [[Stefania Craxi]], Bettino's daughter.\n\n==Death and legacy==\n[[File:Hammamet, tombe de Bettino Craxi.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Craxi's grave in [[Hammamet, Tunisia|Hammamet]], Tunisia]]\nAll this resulted in him being considered the symbol of [[political corruption]]. Bettino Craxi escaped the laws he had once contributed to make, by fleeing to [[Hammamet, Tunisia]], in 1994, and remained a fugitive there, protected by [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali|Ben Ali]]'s government, who was a personal friend of Craxi. He repeatedly declared himself innocent, but never returned to Italy where he had been sentenced to 27 years in jail because of his corruption crimes (of these, 9 years and 8 months were upheld on appeal).\n\nCraxi died on 19 January 2000, at the age of 65, from complications of [[diabetes]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/610659.stm|title=Craxi: Fallen kingpin|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=20 January 2000|accessdate=13 April 2013}}</ref> The then Prime Minister and [[Democrats of the Left]] leader, [[Massimo D'Alema]], proposed a state funeral, but his proposal was not accepted by Craxi's own family, who accused the then government of preventing Craxi to return to Italy to undergo a delicate surgery at the [[San Raffaele Hospital]] in Milan.\n\nCraxi's funeral took place at the [[Cathedral of St. Vincent de Paul]] in Tunis and saw a large participation of the indigenous population. Former PSI militants and other Italians arrived in Tunisia to make the last greetings to their leaders. His supporters came outside the Tunisian cathedral and targeted by insults and a launch of coins the representatives of the Italian government, [[Lamberto Dini]] and [[Marco Minniti]].<ref>[http://www.repubblica.it/online/politica/craxi1/hammamet2/hammamet2.html Craxi, l'ultimo saluto.
