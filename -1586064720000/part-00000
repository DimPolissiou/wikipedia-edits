''Haseki'' is, therefore, one who belongs exclusively to the sultan.<ref>Davis (1986)</ref>\n\n[[Sultan]] (\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646) is an Arabic word,  that indicates \"authority\" or \"dominion\". starting from the 16th century, this title, was carried by both men and women of the Ottoman dynasty. Thus, replacing other titles by which prominent members of the imperial family had been known (notably ''hatun'' for women and ''bey'' for men).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L6-VRgVzRcUC&pg=PA18&dq=Sultan+a+word+with+arabic+origin&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwis8ruCx6_XAhVKtBoKHVvVBacQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&q=Sultan%20a%20word%20with%20arabic%20origin&f=false|title=The Imperial Harem: Women and Sovereignty in the Ottoman Empire|last=Peirce|first=Leslie P.|date=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195086775|language=en}}</ref> This usage underlines the Ottoman conception of sovereign power as family prerogative.\n\nWesterns know the Ottoman ruler as \"sultan\", but the Ottomans also used Persian terms such as  \"padi\u015fah\" (emperor) or \"h\u00fcnkar\" to refer to their ruler.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L6-VRgVzRcUC&pg=PA18&dq=Sultan+a+word+with+arabic+origin&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwis8ruCx6_XAhVKtBoKHVvVBacQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&q=Sultan%20a%20word%20with%20arabic%20origin&f=false|title=The Imperial Harem: Women and Sovereignty in the Ottoman Empire|last=Peirce|first=Leslie P.|date=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195086775|language=en}}</ref> The emperor's formal title consisted of \"sultan\" together with \"[[Khan (title)|han]]\" (for example, [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Sultan Suleiman Han]]). In formal address, the sultan's children were also entitled \"sultan\", with imperial princes ([[\u015fehzade]]) carrying the title before their given name, and imperial princesses carrying it after. Examples include Sultan Suleiman's son [[\u015eehzade Mehmed|\u015eehzade Sultan Mehmed]] and his daughter [[Mihrimah Sultan (daughter of Suleiman I)|Mihrimah Sultan]]. Like imperial princesses, the living mothers and main consorts of the reigning sultan carried the title \"sultan\" after their given names, for example, [[Hafsa Sultan]], Suleiman's mother and first [[valide sultan]], and [[H\u00fcrrem Sultan]], Suleiman's chief consort and first haseki sultan. The evolving usage of this title reflected power shifts among imperial women, especially during the [[Sultanate of Women]]. As the position of the chief consort eroded over the course of the 17th century, the main consort lost the title \"sultan\", which was replaced by \"kadin\", a title related to the earlier \"hatun\". Henceforth, the mother of the reigning sultan was the only person of non-imperial blood to carry the title \"sultan\".<ref>Peirce (1993) p.18</ref>\n\nTitle ''haseki'' carried before or after given name. According to a genealogical website, the formal way of addressing a ''haseki'' is ''Devletl\u00fb \u0130smetlu'' (given name) ''Haseki Sult\u00e2n Aliyyet\u00fc'\u015f-\u015e\u00e2n Hazretleri''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.4dw.net/royalark/Turkey/turkey.htm |title=RoyalArk-Turkey |accessdate=2006-09-26 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020418161219/http://www.4dw.net/royalark/Turkey/turkey.htm |archivedate=April 18, 2002 }}</ref> The title \u201csultan\u201d was often translated to ''[[Sultana (title)|sultana]]'', which does not exist in Ottoman royalty, possibly to distinguished female members of the dynasty from the male sultan.\n\n== Usage in Ottoman royalty ==\nDuring early period of the usage of haseki, this title was held by the chief consort of the sultan with special status, and surpassed other titles and ranks by which the prominent consorts of the sultans had been known (''hatun'' and ''kadin''). A haseki sultan had an important place in the palace, being the second most powerful woman and enjoyed the greatest status in the imperial [[harem]] after [[valide sultan]] and usually had chambers close to the sultan's chamber. Haseki Sultan's position, used for a century, reflected the great power of imperial consorts, who were former slaves, in the Ottoman court, elevating their status higher than the Ottoman princesses, and making them the equals of the empress consorts in Europe.\n\nWhen the position of valide sultan was vacant, a haseki could take valide's role, have access to considerable economic resources, become chief of imperial harem, sultan's advisor in politic matters, and even have an influence upon foreign policy and on international politics. These cases happened during [[H\u00fcrrem Sultan]]<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L6-VRgVzRcUC&pg=PA58&dq=hurrem+sultan+power&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjdn5Sr1rHXAhVRnRQKHU_BCq4Q6AEIOzAD#v=onepage&q=hurrem%20sultan%20power&f=false|title=The Imperial Harem: Women and Sovereignty in the Ottoman Empire|last=Peirce|first=Leslie P.|date=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195086775|language=en}}</ref> and [[K\u00f6sem Sultan]]'s eras.\n\nH\u00fcrrem, the first imperial consort who became haseki sultan, was given several special rights during her tenure, especially after the death of Suleiman's mother, Hafsa Sultan, the first valide sultan, in 1534. H\u00fcrrem was allowed to give birth to more than one son, which was a stark violation of the old imperial harem principle of \"one concubine mother \u2014 one son\" that was designed to prevent both the mother's influence over the sultan and the feuds of the blood brothers for the throne. In 1533 or 1534 (the exact date is unknown), Suleiman married H\u00fcrrem in a magnificent formal ceremony, making him the first Ottoman Sultan to wed since [[Orhan Gazi]] (reign 1326\u20131362), and violating a 200-year-old custom of the Ottoman imperial house according to which sultans were not to marry their concubines. Later, H\u00fcrrem became the first prince's mother to remain in the Sultan's court for the duration of her life. In the Ottoman imperial family tradition, a sultan's consort was to remain in the harem only until her son came of age (around 16 or 17), after which he would be sent away from the capital, accompanied by his mother, to govern a faraway province. H\u00fcrrem became Suleiman's partner not only in household, but also in state affairs. Thanks to her intelligence, she acted as Suleiman's chief adviser, and she seems to have had an influence upon foreign policy and international politics. H\u00fcrrem's great power signaled the rise of the chief imperial consort under the title of haseki.\n\nA mother's political role traditionally began with the creation of a separate household for her son. The establishment of her public politic identity entailed her separation from the sultan and his household. As noted above, this kind of functional division appears to have occurred with Nurbanu and Safiye, in spite of the fact that they never left the sultan's household like their predecessor H\u00fcrrem, the shift in their roles, that is, their assumption of candidly political role as haseki may well have coincided with their sons\u2019 assumption of their political posts.<ref>Peirce (1993) p.104</ref>\n\nEven though it became a great position, haseki was not used during reign of [[Mehmed III]], son of [[Murad III]]. The absence of a haseki was probably influenced by two reason: Mehmed's experiences as [[\u015fehzade]] and strong personality of his mother [[Safiye Sultan (wife of Murad III)|Safiye]].<ref>Peirce (1993) p.104</ref>\n\nHaseki was used again during the reign of Mehmed's son Ahmed. The career of Ahmed was very much like that of Suleiman. He chose his second consort, [[K\u00f6sem Sultan|K\u00f6sem]], as his haseki. K\u00f6sem's career was similar to that of H\u00fcrrem in an important respect.<ref>Peirce (1993) p.105</ref> Like H\u00fcrrem, K\u00f6sem is blamed for acting to preserve her own power rather than that of the sultan or of the dynasty. It is certainly worth nothing that the two women of the dynasty to suffer the harshest judgment by history had two things in common: the absence of a valide sultan during most of their career as haseki and an unusually large number of sons. What appears to have earned them their unsavory reputation was their power to influence the fate of the empire by favoring one of their sons over another.<ref>Peirce (1993) p.106</ref>\n\nThe greatest contribution of K\u00f6sem during her tenure as haseki possibly was the significant modifications in the pattern of succession to the throne from a system of [[primogeniture]] to one based on [[agnatic seniority]]. She must have realized the personal gain that might stem from the transition to seniority, coupled with the fact that she was no longer haseki but had son \"in waiting\". According to Venetian ambassador, K\u00f6sem \"lobbied to spare Mustafa the fate of fratricide with the ulterior goal of saving her own son from the same fate.\"<ref>Piterberg (2003) p.14</ref> This new system meant that potential rulers had to wait a long time in the ''[[kafes]]'' before ascending the throne, hence the old age of certain sultans upon their enthronement, made all of [[\u015eehzade|\u015fehzades]] lost their chance to become ruler of one of the Ottoman province as part of their training to become worthy heir to the throne.\n\n=== Decline of the Haseki ===\nOne outcome of all these changes was that the position of haseki lost its traditional logic. A mother's political role traditionally began with the creation of a separate household for her son. The establishment of her public politic identity entailed her separation from the sultan and his household. But when under agnatic seniority, \u015fehzades lost access to public adulthood, their mothers lost their public roles as well. It went against the protocol of the dynastic politics to publicly honor the mother of the son who had yet to achieve public identity. The position of haseki as a true favorite of the sultan was thus incompatible with the practice of agnatic seniority.<ref>Peirce (1993) p.104</ref>\n\nK\u00f6sem Sultan was the last of the influential Ottoman hasekis. The other explanation for the decline of the haseki and the re-emergence of the valide in the first decades of the seventeenth century has much to do with K\u00f6sem Sultan's personality and the fact that in 1617 she had ceased being a haseki, and if she were to regain power, she could obtain it only from the position of Valide Sultan.\n\nAfter Ahmed I's death in 1617, the position of Haseki Sultan lost its special status. [[Osman II]] had a consort with haseki rank, but all that can be determined about her is that her name was [[Ay\u015fe Sultan (wife of Osman II)|Ay\u015fe]].{{refn|group=note|According to Piterberg, Osman II did not have haseki and Ay\u015fe just \"a politically insignificant consort.\"<ref>Piterberg (2003) p.18</ref>}} As with Osman, very little is known about the concubines of his brother [[Murad IV]]. Privy purse registers record the presence of a single haseki, [[Ay\u015fe Sultan (wife of Murad IV)|Ay\u015fe]], until the very end of Murad's seventeen years reign, when a second haseki appears. It is possible that Murad had only a single concubine until the advent of the second one, or that he had a number of concubines but singled out only two of them as hasekis. [[Ibrahim of the Ottoman Empire|Ibrahim]] had eight hasekis, of whom the first three \u2013 [[Turhan Sultan|Turhan]], [[A\u015fub Sultan|A\u015fub]], and [[Muazzez Sultan|Muazzez]] \u2013 each had one son.<ref>Peirce (1993) p.107</ref>\n\nThe presence of more than one haseki was a significant change in the reign of Murad and Ibrahim, signaling that the age of the haseki was coming to an end. With K\u00f6sem's strong personality and influence as valide sultan, the title haseki sultan which was held by eight women simultaneously, and all \u015fehzades lost their provincial post during Ibrahim's era and it made title haseki lose its special status. In this period the meaning of the title began to shift from a \"chief consort\" and \"single favorite\" to something more general like \"imperial consort\", similar to the earlier ''[[hatun]]''.<ref>Peirce (1993) p.107</ref>\n\nThe title haseki sultan was only used for around a century until the 17th century. After that, ''[[Kad\u0131n (title)|kad\u0131n]]'' became highest rank for the imperial consorts again, used with title ''efendi''. The last woman in Ottoman history who used the title of \"Haseki Sultan\" was [[Rabia Sultan]].\n\n== List of Hasekis ==\nThe title was first used in the 16th century for [[Roxelana|H\u00fcrrem Sultan]], also known as Roxelana, when she was given favor by [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]. She was his chief consort and the mother of [[Selim II]]. H\u00fcrrem Sultan was married to Sultan Suleiman, becoming both his legal wife and one of the most powerful women in the Ottoman Empire. The title was next held by [[Nurbanu Sultan]], favourite wife of [[Selim II]], and the mother of the next Sultan [[Murad III]]. In 1575, just after Murad's accession, [[Safiye Sultan (wife of Murad III)|Safiye Sultan]] became the haseki and was given a higher rank than the sultan's own sisters, [[Ismihan Sultan]], [[Gevherhan Sultan (daughter of Selim II)|Gevherhan Sultan]] and [[\u015eah Sultan (daughter of Selim II)|\u015eah Sultan]].\n\n[[Leslie P. Peirce]] points out that during [[Mehmed III]]'s reign, the title haseki did not came in use.<ref>Peirce (1993) p.104</ref> However, according to the contemporary historian [[Mustafa Selaniki]], Mehmed had a haseki, who was mother of a son, and died of plague in July 1598, early in his reign.<ref>{{cite book|first=Mehmet|last=Ip\u015f\u0131rl\u0131|title=Mustafa Selaniki's history of the Ottomans|publisher=|year=June 1976|pages=172|isbn=}}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=January 2017}} Mehmed's son [[Ahmed I]] gave the title haseki to [[K\u00f6sem Sultan]], his favourite wife and the mother of Sultans [[Murad IV]] and [[Ibrahim of the Ottoman Empire|Ibrahim]]. [[Osman II]] has one haseki, [[Ay\u015fe Hatun (wife of Osman II)|Ay\u015fe Sultan]]. [[Privy Purse]] registers record the presence of [[Ay\u015fe Hatun (wife of Murad IV)|Ay\u015fe]] as [[Murad IV]]'s only haseki, until the very end of Murad's seventeen-year reign, when a second haseki appears.<ref name=\"P106\">Peirce (1993) p.106\u2013107</ref> But still the hasekis continued to rank higher than princesses. Ibrahim had eight hasekis<ref name=\"P106\"/>; [[Turhan Sultan|Turhan]], [[A\u015fub Sultan|A\u015fub]], [[Muazzez Sultan|Muazzez]], Ay\u015fe, Mahienver, [[\u015eivekar Sultan|\u0218ivekar]], Sa\u00e7ba\u011fi and [[H\u00fcma\u015fah Sultan (wife of Ibrahim)|H\u00fcma\u015fah Sultan]]. Ibrahim's son and successor is known to have one haseki, [[G\u00fclnu\u015f Sultan]]. [[Suleiman II of the Ottoman Empire|Suleiman II]] didn't have a haseki. His brother [[Ahmed II]] had one haseki [[Rabia Sultan]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Name\n!Maiden Name\n!Origin\n!Ceased to be the Imperial Consort\n!Death\n!Spouse\n|-\n|align=center| [[Roxelana|H\u00fcrrem Sultan]]<br />\u062e\u064f\u0631\u064e\u0651\u0645 \u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646 ||align=\"center\"| Aleksandra or<br />Anastazja Lisowska ||align=\"center\"| Ruthenian.

This usage underlines the Ottoman conception of sovereign power as family prerogative.\n\nWesterns know the Ottoman ruler as \"sultan\", but the Ottomans also used Persian terms such as  \"padi\u015fah\" (emperor) or \"h\u00fcnkar\" to refer to their ruler<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L6-VRgVzRcUC&pg=PA18&dq=Sultan+a+word+with+arabic+origin&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwis8ruCx6_XAhVKtBoKHVvVBacQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&q=Sultan%20a%20word%20with%20arabic%20origin&f=false|title=The Imperial Harem: Women and Sovereignty in the Ottoman Empire|last=Peirce|first=Leslie P.|date=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195086775|language=en}}</ref>. The emperor's formal title consisted of \"sultan\" together with \"[[Khan (title)|han]]\" (for example, [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Sultan Suleiman Han]]). In formal address, the sultan's children were also entitled \"sultan\", with imperial princes ([[\u015fehzade]]) carrying the title before their given name, and imperial princesses carrying it after. Examples include Sultan Suleiman's son [[\u015eehzade Mehmed|\u015eehzade Sultan Mehmed]] and his daughter [[Mihrimah Sultan (daughter of Suleiman I)|Mihrimah Sultan]]. Like imperial princesses, the living mothers and main consorts of the reigning sultan carried the title \"sultan\" after their given names, for example, [[Hafsa Sultan]], Suleiman's mother and first [[valide sultan]], and [[H\u00fcrrem Sultan]], Suleiman's chief consort and first haseki sultan. The evolving usage of this title reflected power shifts among imperial women, especially during the [[Sultanate of Women]]. As the position of the chief consort eroded over the course of the 17th century, the main consort lost the title \"sultan\", which was replaced by \"kadin\", a title related to the earlier \"hatun\". Henceforth, the mother of the reigning sultan was the only person of non-imperial blood to carry the title \"sultan\".<ref>Peirce (1993) p.18</ref>\n\nTitle ''haseki'' carried before or after given name. According to a genealogical website, the formal way of addressing a ''haseki'' is ''Devletl\u00fb \u0130smetlu'' (given name) ''Haseki Sult\u00e2n Aliyyet\u00fc'\u015f-\u015e\u00e2n Hazretleri''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.4dw.net/royalark/Turkey/turkey.htm |title=RoyalArk-Turkey |accessdate=2006-09-26 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020418161219/http://www.4dw.net/royalark/Turkey/turkey.htm |archivedate=April 18, 2002 }}</ref> The title \u201csultan\u201d was often translated to ''[[Sultana (title)|sultana]]'', which does not exist in Ottoman royalty, possibly to distinguished female members of the dynasty from the male sultan.\n\n== Usage in Ottoman royalty ==\nDuring early period of the usage of haseki, this title was held by the chief consort of the sultan with special status, and surpassed other titles and ranks by which the prominent consorts of the sultans had been known (''hatun'' and ''kadin''). A haseki sultan had an important place in the palace, being the second most powerful woman and enjoyed the greatest status in the imperial [[harem]] after [[valide sultan]] and usually had chambers close to the sultan's chamber. Haseki Sultan's position, used for a century, reflected the great power of imperial consorts, who were former slaves, in the Ottoman court, elevating their status higher than the Ottoman princesses, and making them the equals of the empress consorts in Europe.\n\nWhen the position of valide sultan was vacant, a haseki could take valide's role, have access to considerable economic resources, become chief of imperial harem, sultan's advisor in politic matters, and even have an influence upon foreign policy and on international politics. These cases happened during [[H\u00fcrrem Sultan]]<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L6-VRgVzRcUC&pg=PA58&dq=hurrem+sultan+power&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjdn5Sr1rHXAhVRnRQKHU_BCq4Q6AEIOzAD#v=onepage&q=hurrem%20sultan%20power&f=false|title=The Imperial Harem: Women and Sovereignty in the Ottoman Empire|last=Peirce|first=Leslie P.|date=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195086775|language=en}}</ref> and [[K\u00f6sem Sultan]]'s eras.\n\nH\u00fcrrem, the first imperial consort who became haseki sultan, was given several special rights during her tenure, especially after the death of Suleiman's mother, Hafsa Sultan, the first valide sultan, in 1534. H\u00fcrrem was allowed to give birth to more than one son, which was a stark violation of the old imperial harem principle of \"one concubine mother \u2014 one son\" that was designed to prevent both the mother's influence over the sultan and the feuds of the blood brothers for the throne. In 1533 or 1534 (the exact date is unknown), Suleiman married H\u00fcrrem in a magnificent formal ceremony, making him the first Ottoman Sultan to wed since [[Orhan Gazi]] (reign 1326\u20131362), and violating a 200-year-old custom of the Ottoman imperial house according to which sultans were not to marry their concubines. Later, H\u00fcrrem became the first prince's mother to remain in the Sultan's court for the duration of her life. In the Ottoman imperial family tradition, a sultan's consort was to remain in the harem only until her son came of age (around 16 or 17), after which he would be sent away from the capital, accompanied by his mother, to govern a faraway province. H\u00fcrrem became Suleiman's partner not only in household, but also in state affairs. Thanks to her intelligence, she acted as Suleiman's chief adviser, and she seems to have had an influence upon foreign policy and international politics. H\u00fcrrem's great power signaled the rise of the chief imperial consort under the title of haseki.\n\nA mother's political role traditionally began with the creation of a separate household for her son. The establishment of her public politic identity entailed her separation from the sultan and his household. As noted above, this kind of functional division appears to have occurred with Nurbanu and Safiye, in spite of the fact that they never left the sultan's household like their predecessor H\u00fcrrem, the shift in their roles, that is, their assumption of candidly political role as haseki may well have coincided with their sons\u2019 assumption of their political posts.<ref>Peirce (1993) p.104</ref>\n\nEven though it became a great position, haseki was not used during reign of [[Mehmed III]], son of [[Murad III]]. The absence of a haseki was probably influenced by two reason: Mehmed's experiences as [[\u015fehzade]] and strong personality of his mother [[Safiye Sultan (wife of Murad III)|Safiye]].<ref>Peirce (1993) p.104</ref>\n\nHaseki was used again during the reign of Mehmed's son Ahmed. The career of Ahmed was very much like that of Suleiman. He chose his second consort, [[K\u00f6sem Sultan|K\u00f6sem]], as his haseki. K\u00f6sem's career was similar to that of H\u00fcrrem in an important respect.<ref>Peirce (1993) p.105</ref> Like H\u00fcrrem, K\u00f6sem is blamed for acting to preserve her own power rather than that of the sultan or of the dynasty. It is certainly worth nothing that the two women of the dynasty to suffer the harshest judgment by history had two things in common: the absence of a valide sultan during most of their career as haseki and an unusually large number of sons. What appears to have earned them their unsavory reputation was their power to influence the fate of the empire by favoring one of their sons over another.<ref>Peirce (1993) p.106</ref>\n\nThe greatest contribution of K\u00f6sem during her tenure as haseki possibly was the significant modifications in the pattern of succession to the throne from a system of [[primogeniture]] to one based on [[agnatic seniority]]. She must have realized the personal gain that might stem from the transition to seniority, coupled with the fact that she was no longer haseki but had son \"in waiting\". According to Venetian ambassador, K\u00f6sem \"lobbied to spare Mustafa the fate of fratricide with the ulterior goal of saving her own son from the same fate.\"<ref>Piterberg (2003) p.14</ref> This new system meant that potential rulers had to wait a long time in the ''[[kafes]]'' before ascending the throne, hence the old age of certain sultans upon their enthronement, made all of [[\u015eehzade|\u015fehzades]] lost their chance to become ruler of one of the Ottoman province as part of their training to become worthy heir to the throne.\n\n=== Decline of the Haseki ===\nOne outcome of all these changes was that the position of haseki lost its traditional logic. A mother's political role traditionally began with the creation of a separate household for her son. The establishment of her public politic identity entailed her separation from the sultan and his household. But when under agnatic seniority, \u015fehzades lost access to public adulthood, their mothers lost their public roles as well. It went against the protocol of the dynastic politics to publicly honor the mother of the son who had yet to achieve public identity. The position of haseki as a true favorite of the sultan was thus incompatible with the practice of agnatic seniority.<ref>Peirce (1993) p.104</ref>\n\nK\u00f6sem Sultan was the last of the influential Ottoman hasekis. The other explanation for the decline of the haseki and the re-emergence of the valide in the first decades of the seventeenth century has much to do with K\u00f6sem Sultan's personality and the fact that in 1617 she had ceased being a haseki, and if she were to regain power, she could obtain it only from the position of Valide Sultan.\n\nAfter Ahmed I's death in 1617, the position of Haseki Sultan lost its special status. [[Osman II]] had a consort with haseki rank, but all that can be determined about her is that her name was [[Ay\u015fe Sultan (wife of Osman II)|Ay\u015fe]].{{refn|group=note|According to Piterberg, Osman II did not have haseki and Ay\u015fe just \"a politically insignificant consort.\"<ref>Piterberg (2003) p.18</ref>}} As with Osman, very little is known about the concubines of his brother [[Murad IV]]. Privy purse registers record the presence of a single haseki, [[Ay\u015fe Sultan (wife of Murad IV)|Ay\u015fe]], until the very end of Murad's seventeen years reign, when a second haseki appears. It is possible that Murad had only a single concubine until the advent of the second one, or that he had a number of concubines but singled out only two of them as hasekis. [[Ibrahim of the Ottoman Empire|Ibrahim]] had eight hasekis, of whom the first three \u2013 [[Turhan Sultan|Turhan]], [[A\u015fub Sultan|A\u015fub]], and [[Muazzez Sultan|Muazzez]] \u2013 each had one son.<ref>Peirce (1993) p.107</ref>\n\nThe presence of more than one haseki was a significant change in the reign of Murad and Ibrahim, signaling that the age of the haseki was coming to an end. With K\u00f6sem's strong personality and influence as valide sultan, the title haseki sultan which was held by eight women simultaneously, and all \u015fehzades lost their provincial post during Ibrahim's era and it made title haseki lose its special status. In this period the meaning of the title began to shift from a \"chief consort\" and \"single favorite\" to something more general like \"imperial consort\", similar to the earlier ''[[hatun]]''.<ref>Peirce (1993) p.107</ref>\n\nThe title haseki sultan was only used for around a century until the 17th century. After that, ''[[Kad\u0131n (title)|kad\u0131n]]'' became highest rank for the imperial consorts again, used with title ''efendi''. The last woman in Ottoman history who used the title of \"Haseki Sultan\" was [[Rabia Sultan]].\n\n== List of Hasekis ==\nThe title was first used in the 16th century for [[Roxelana|H\u00fcrrem Sultan]], also known as Roxelana, when she was given favor by [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]. She was his chief consort and the mother of [[Selim II]]. H\u00fcrrem Sultan was married to Sultan Suleiman, becoming both his legal wife and one of the most powerful women in the Ottoman Empire. The title was next held by [[Nurbanu Sultan]], favourite wife of [[Selim II]], and the mother of the next Sultan [[Murad III]]. In 1575, just after Murad's accession, [[Safiye Sultan (wife of Murad III)|Safiye Sultan]] became the haseki and was given a higher rank than the sultan's own sisters, [[Ismihan Sultan]], [[Gevherhan Sultan (daughter of Selim II)|Gevherhan Sultan]] and [[\u015eah Sultan (daughter of Selim II)|\u015eah Sultan]].\n\n[[Leslie P. Peirce]] points out that during [[Mehmed III]]'s reign, the title haseki did not came in use.<ref>Peirce (1993) p.104</ref> However, according to the contemporary historian [[Mustafa Selaniki]], Mehmed had a haseki, who was mother of a son, and died of plague in July 1598, early in his reign.<ref>{{cite book|first=Mehmet|last=Ip\u015f\u0131rl\u0131|title=Mustafa Selaniki's history of the Ottomans|publisher=|year=June 1976|pages=172|isbn=}}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=January 2017}} Mehmed's son [[Ahmed I]] gave the title haseki to [[K\u00f6sem Sultan]], his favourite wife and the mother of Sultans [[Murad IV]] and [[Ibrahim of the Ottoman Empire|Ibrahim]]. [[Osman II]] has one haseki, [[Ay\u015fe Hatun (wife of Osman II)|Ay\u015fe Sultan]]. [[Privy Purse]] registers record the presence of [[Ay\u015fe Hatun (wife of Murad IV)|Ay\u015fe]] as [[Murad IV]]'s only haseki, until the very end of Murad's seventeen-year reign, when a second haseki appears.<ref name=\"P106\">Peirce (1993) p.106\u2013107</ref> But still the hasekis continued to rank higher than princesses.

Since then the school has evolved a lot and the number of students has increased considerably.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Nowadays the school receives mostly French-Mexican and Mexican students, but also children of many diplomats from all over the world, the children of all the French expatriate workers and many other students from other European countries.\n\n==Structure==\nBefore the equivalent of [[high school]], the school is divided into a \"French\" and a \"bilingual\" section. In the first one, all the courses are given in French (except language courses). In the other section, the classes are taught in Spanish, but they include a [[French language]] course. By high school, students of the \"bilingual\" section are proficient in the language and the two sections are mixed together under the French system and all courses are in French.\n\n==Academic performance==\nThe academic level of the school is extremely good and it is recognized as one of the best schools in Mexico, especially recognized for its high level of mathematics (on the same level than the [[Liceo Mexicano Japones|Mexican-Japanese Lyceum]] and the [[Colegio Alem\u00e1n Alexander von Humboldt (Mexico City)|Colegio Alem\u00e1n Alexander von Humboldt]]). The results of the [[Baccalaur\u00e9at]] are especially good, with 97% of students having passed the exam. \nAfter graduating, the students follow several paths. The majority are admitted into prestigious Mexican universities, however a good amount also follow superior studies in French universities and the so-called \"classes prepa\". There is also an increasing number of students who decide to study in other countries (US, Switzerland, UK, etc.).{{fact|date=December 2017}}\n\n==Architecture==\nThe school building{{which|date=December 2017}}<!--Polanco or Coyoacan--> was designed by [[Vladimir Kasp\u00e9]].<ref>Turner, Jane.

Since then the school has evolved a lot and the number of students has increased considerably.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Nowadays the school receives mostly French-Mexican and Mexican students, but also children of many diplomats from all over the world, the children of all the French expatriate workers and many other students from other European countries.\n\n==Structure==\nBefore the equivalent of [[high school]], the school is divided into a \"French\" and a \"bilingual\" section. In the first one, all the courses are given in French (except language courses). In the other section, the classes are taught in Spanish, but they include a [[French language]] course. By high school, students of the \"bilingual\" section are proficient in the language and the two sections are mixed together under the French system and all courses are in French.\n\n==Academic performance==\nThe academic level of the school is extremely good and it is recognized as one of the best schools in Mexico, especially recognized for its high level of mathematics (on the same level than the [[Liceo Mexicano Japones|Mexican-Japanese Lyceum]] and the [[Colegio Alem\u00e1n Alexander von Humboldt (Mexico City)|Colegio Alem\u00e1n Alexander von Humboldt]]). The results of the [[Baccalaur\u00e9at]] are especially good, with 97% of students having passed the exam. \nAfter graduating, the students follow several paths. The majority are admitted into prestigious Mexican universities, however a good amount also follow superior studies in French universities and the so-called \"classes prepa\". There is also an increasing number of students who decide to study in other countries (US, Switzerland, UK, etc.).{{fact|date=December 2017}}\n\n==Architecture==\nThe school building{{which|date=December 2017}}<!--Polanco or Coyoacan--> was designed by [[Vladimir Kasp\u00e9]].<ref>Turner, Jane.

K. Rowling]] is one of the [[List of literary works by number of translations|most translated series of all time]], with the first book, ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', having been translated into over 76 languages. This includes languages diverse as [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]] and [[Welsh language|Welsh]] as well as the dead languages [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek]]. This makes it the longest published work in Ancient Greek since the novels of [[Heliodorus of Emesa]] in the 3rd century AD. Additionally, regional adaptations of the books have been made to accommodate regional dialects such as the [[American English]] edition or the [[Valencian]] adaptation of [[Catalan language|Catalan]].\n\nFor reasons of secrecy, translations were only allowed to begin after each book had been published in English, creating a lag of several months for readers of other languages. Impatient fans in many places simply bought the book in English instead. In France in 2003 the fifth book, ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', became the first book in English to top the French best-seller list. Another response to this, and unavailability in certain languages, has been fans creating their own translations unofficially.\n\nInteresting issues arising in the translation of ''Harry Potter'' include cultural references, riddles, anticipating future plot points, and Rowling's creative names for characters and other elements in the magical world which often involve wordplay and descriptive phonology.\n\n== Translation process ==\nFor an authorised translation, the publisher must first negotiate and sign a contract with the author's agents, The Blair Partnership.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/links_cl.cfm |title=J.

K. Rowling's website. The publishers select translators locally.\n\nTranslators were not granted access to the books before their official release date in English; hence, translation could start only after the English editions had been published, creating a lag of several months before the translations were made available. This necessary delay has boosted the sales of English language editions of the books to impatient fans, in countries where English is not the first language. Such was the clamour to read the fifth book that its English edition became the first English-language book ever to top the bookseller list in France.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/world/newsid_3036000/3036350.stm|publisher=BBC|title=OOTP is best seller in France \u2013 in English!|date=1 July 2003}}</ref> In Italy, impatient Potter fans organised \"Operation Feather\", deluging the publisher Salani with feathers (reminiscent of Hogwarts' messenger owls) to demand expedited publication for the Italian translation of the seventh and final book in the series.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/children/article2645098.ece |title=Who won the race to translate 'Harry Potter'? review &#124; Children's Books \u2013 Times Online |publisher=Times Newspapers Ltd. |date= 2007-10-12|accessdate=2008-12-12 | location=London |first1=Philippe |last1=Naughton |first2=Adam |last2=Sage}}</ref> This has also caused unauthorised translations and fake versions of the books to appear in many countries.\n\nThe high profile and demand for a high-quality local translation means that a great deal of care is often taken in the task. In some countries, such as Italy, the first book was revised by the publishers and issued in an updated edition in response to readers who complained about the quality of the first translation. In countries such as China and Portugal, the translation is conducted by a group of translators working together to save time. Some of the translators hired to work on the books were well known before their work on Harry Potter, such as [[Viktor Golyshev]], who oversaw the [[Russian language|Russian]] translation of the series' fifth book. Golyshev was previously best known for having translated [[William Faulkner]] and [[George Orwell]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Translating Harry \u2014 Part I: The Language of Magic|author=Steven Goldstein|url=http://www.globalbydesign.com/resources/articles/translating_harry_potter_part1.html|work=GlobalByDesign|year=2004|accessdate=2007-05-09|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070306025320/http://www.globalbydesign.com/resources/articles/translating_harry_potter_part1.html|archivedate=6 March 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and was known to snub the Harry Potter books in interviews and refer to them as inferior literature.

Thus: 85 &minus; 1 English &minus; 6 double-translations = 78.<ref name=\"potterglot_list\" /> It is also worthwhile to emphasize that not all seven books have been translated into these 78 languages.\n\nThe 85 total does not include other linguistically interesting language editions: there have been many regional adaptations of the books to accommodate regional dialects, for example the [[American English]] edition or the [[Valencian]] adaptation of Catalan. There have been transliterations of translations into different scripts ([[English Braille]], [[Serbian Cyrillic]]), there have been major revisions of the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] translations and there have been any number of unauthorized translations.<ref name=\"potterglot_list\" />\n\nSome translations, such as those to the [[Language death|dead]] Latin and [[Ancient Greek]] languages, were done as academic exercises, to stimulate interest in the languages and to provide students of those languages with modern reading texts. The Ancient Greek version, according to the translator, is the longest text written in Ancient Greek since the novels of [[Heliodorus of Emesa]] in the 3rd century AD, and took about a year to complete.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://playalicious.com/reference/news/greek_harry.html |title=Harry Potter?

The work may be done by multiple translators to speed the process. Such translations are often poorly written and riddled with errors. Cases have occurred in many areas of the world, but China is one of the most common areas of the world for unauthorised translations and pirated editions to be sold.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-08/09/content_6500798.htm |title=Online translations of \"Harry Potter\" draw fire |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |accessdate=2008-12-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504041532/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-08/09/content_6500798.htm |archivedate=4 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}also see [[Chinese literature]], bookmarket</ref>\n\nOne notable case involved a French 16-year-old who published serialised translations of ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'' online. He was arrested and his site was later shut down; however, the wife of the official translator noted that these works do not necessarily hurt the official translation.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/aug/08/france.harrypotter |title=Harry Potter and the boy wizard translator &#124; World news &#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=guardian.co.uk, Wednesday 8 August 2007 17.51 BST |accessdate=2008-12-12 | location=London | date=2007-08-09 | first=Kim | last=Willsher}}</ref>\n\nAnother example occurred in Venezuela in 2003, when an illegal translation of the fifth book, ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', appeared soon after the release of the English version and five months before the scheduled release of the Spanish translation. The pirate translation was apparently so bad that the translator added messages, including \"Here comes something that I'm unable to translate, sorry,\" and \"I'm sorry, I didn't understand what that meant\" in some sections. Two people were arrested in connection with the pirated version.<ref>{{cite news\n | title = Potter Pirate Sorry for Mistakes | publisher = BBC News | date = 3 September 2003 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3079032.stm | accessdate = 2007-02-18 }}</ref>\n\nAnother case involved the internet [[fan translation]] community, ''Harry auf Deutsch'', formed to translate the Harry Potter books into German more rapidly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harry-auf-deutsch.de/ |title=Harry auf Deutsch :: Projekt-\u00dcbersicht der Harry Potter \u00dcbersetzung(en) |publisher=Harry-auf-deutsch.de |date= |accessdate=2008-12-12}}</ref> The German publisher of the Harry Potter books, [[Carlsen Verlag]], filed a [[cease and desist]] against the fan translators; they complied, taking down the translations.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/906048.stm |title=BBC News &#124; SCI/TECH &#124; Harry Potter and the German pirates |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2008-12-12 | date=2000-09-01}}</ref>\n\nIn some countries, when there were no authorised translations into the local language, translations not sanctioned by J.

For example, there are a number of differences in American and UK English spelling conventions; generally publishers change the spellings to conform to the expectations of their target market. Adaptation may also extend to vocabulary or grammatical choices that might impair legibility or impart some cognitive dissonance. Readers usually wouldn't be aware of the adaptations, but the choice to change the title of the American edition of the first Harry Potter book from ''Harry Potter and the '''Philosopher's''' Stone'' to ''Harry Potter and the '''Sorcerer's''' Stone'' highlighted the practice and drew considerable attention.\n\nThe book's title was changed due to the American publisher's concern that children would be confused by a reference to philosophy. Other translations have also changed the first book's title, for instance, the French translation which changed ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'' to ''Harry Potter at the School of Wizards'' for the same reason as the American translation, citing that the reference to the Philosopher's Stone legend was \"too obscure for a book aimed at the youth.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |title = The Translator's 'Magic' Wand: Harry Potter's Journey from English into French|journal = Meta : Journal des Traducteurs / Meta: Translators' Journal|volume = 51|issue = 3|pages = 459\u2013481|year = 2006|last1 = Feral|first1 = Anne-Lise|doi = 10.7202/013553ar}}</ref>\n\nOther translations also have regional adaptations that have largely gone without much notice. The Spanish translation has been adapted to three regions: Europe, Latin America and [[Southern Cone]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.potterglot.net/harry-potter-and-the-spanish-tykes/|title=Harry Potter and the Spanish Tykes|accessdate=2018-03-06}}</ref> Others translations have adaptations that were published seemingly to enhance the identity of minority communities of speakers: [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]] (an adaptation of [[Serbian language|Serbian]]) and [[Valencian]] (an adaptation of [[Catalan language|Catalan]]). It is worth noting that some translations were completed when adaptations possibly would have been sufficient; for example, any of the [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]] or [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] translations could have been adapted for each region; however, the complexities political and linguistic identity in the region probably precluded that choice.\n\nThe [[American English]] adaptations have by far received the most attention. A comprehensive list of differences between the American and British editions of the books is collected at [[the Harry Potter Lexicon]] web site.<ref>{{cite web|author=Edward Olson |url=http://www.hp-lexicon.org/about/books/cs/differences-cs.html |title=HPL: Differences: CS |publisher=Hp-lexicon.org |date= 29 October 2001|accessdate=2008-12-12}}</ref> The changes are mostly simple lexical switches to reflect [[American and British English differences|the different dialects]] and prevent American readers from stumbling over unfamiliar [[Glossary of British terms not widely used in the United States|Briticism]]s.

Her American editor pointed out that the word jumper \u2013 British for pullover sweater \u2013 means a kind of dress in American. She had had no idea. \"He asked, 'Can we change it to sweater,' which is just as British?\" That was fine with Rowling.<ref>{{cite news | last = Woods | first = Audrey\n | title = Success Stuns Harry Potter Author | agency = Associated Press | date = 6 July 2000}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nPublisher Arthur Levine of [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]] explained the changes in an interview in ''[[The New Yorker]]'':\n<blockquote>I wasn't trying to, quote, \"Americanize\" them... What I was trying to do is translate, which I think is different. I wanted to make sure that an American kid reading the book would have the same literary experience that a British kid would have.\"<ref>{{cite news | last = Radosh | first = Daniel | title = Why American kids don't consider Harry Potter an insufferable prig | publisher = [[The New Yorker]] | date = 20 September 1999}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe same article, however, points out that some British dialect was retained in the books, and in some cases certain phrases were replaced with more stereotypical British phrases, such as \"spanking good\" for \"cracking.\"\n\nRegional adaptations have sometimes\u2014incorrectly\u2014been referred to as \"translations\" (as in the quote above); however, the changes in the text of an adaptation do not nearly encompass the scope of a translation. A native speaker generally would not be able to tell the difference between two adaptations without careful reading. A translation requires a translator who will be credited for the work\u2014notably, an adaptation will by performed by an editor probably with the assistance of software and the original translator will remain credited as such.\n\n== Issues in translation ==\nThe Harry Potter series presents many challenges to translators, such as rhymes, acronyms, dialects, culture, riddles, jokes, invented words, and plot points that revolve around spellings or initials. These have been dealt with by various translators with different degrees of modification to the meaning of the original text.\n\n=== Translation strategies ===\nThe books carried a number of words that are considered ''loaded names'' by linguists and translators, meaning that they carry a [[semantic]] load, and that their [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (structure) and [[phonology]] (sound) need to be adapted when translating them to a foreign language, for example the house names (Ravenclaw = [[raven]] + [[claw]]), or Voldemort's name (\"flight of death\" or \"theft of death\" in French).<ref name=\"lincoln\">{{cite journal | journal = [[New Voices in Translation Studies]] | title = Translation of Names in Children's Fantasy Literature: Bringing the Young Reader into Play | author = Lincoln Fernandes | issue = 2 | year = 2006 | url = http://www.iatis.org/newvoices/issues/2006/fernandes-paper-2006.pdf | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090419092822/http://www.iatis.org/newvoices/issues/2006/fernandes-paper-2006.pdf | archivedate = 19 April 2009 | df = dmy-all }} (page 6 on pdf)</ref> These words were translated in different countries using several translation strategies, such as ''copying'' the names with no attempt to transmit the original English meaning, ''[[transliteration|transliterating]]'' even if the name lost its original meaning, ''replacing'' the name with another given name from the target language, or ''translating'' the name using native words that conveyed the same meaning.<ref name=\"lincoln\" /><ref name=\"russian\">{{cite journal | journal = [[Meta Translators' Journal]] | title = From Harry to Garri: Strategies for the Transfer of Culture and Ideology in Russian Translations of Two English Fantasy Stories | author = Judith Inggs | volume = 48 | issue = 1\u20132 Traduction pour les enfants / Translation for children | date = May 2003 | pages = 285\u2013297 | doi=10.7202/006975ar}}</ref> For example, in the Russian first book the transliterating strategy was used for some names because the \"th\" sound does not exist in Russian, so \"Slytherin\" was transliterated as \"Slizerin\". The translator of the second book chose the translating strategy instead, and she renamed the houses, \"Hufflepuff\" becoming \"Puffendui\" and \"Ravenclaw\" becoming \"Kogtevran\" (from the Russian word for claw, \"kogot'\"). In the Italian editions, the house names were changed to animal-colour pairings: Gryffindor is \"Grifondoro\" (\"grifon d'oro\" means \"golden [[griffin]]\"), Slytherin is \"Serpeverde\" (\"serpe verde\" means \"green snake\"), Ravenclaw was, in the first edition of the first book, \"Pecoranera\" (\"pecora nera\", \"black sheep\"), but was then changed to \"Corvonero\" (\"corvo nero\", \"black raven\") and Hufflepuff is \"Tassorosso\" (\"tasso rosso\", \"red badger\") in the first translation and the films and \"Tassofrasso\" in the revisited translation.<ref>https://www.potterpedia.it/?v=Traduzioni_Rivisitate:_Tassorosso_e_Tassofrasso</ref> In the French translation, the name \"Hogwarts\" is changed to \"Poudlard\", which means \"bacon lice.\" <ref name=\"tab\"/>\n\n=== Culture and language ===\nMany of the nuances of British culture and language will be unfamiliar to international readers. Such things require careful and creative translating. For the Hebrew translation, some of the Christian references were changed, because Israelis have less familiarity with cultural Christianity than readers elsewhere: a scene in which Sirius Black sings a parody of \"[[God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen]]\" replaced the song with a parody of \"[[Hanukkah music#Mi Y'malel|Mi Y'malel]],\" a Chanukah song<ref name=\"CJN\" />; on the other hand, in the Yiddish translation, translator Arun Viswanath retained all the Christian references, feeling that his readership would be familiar enough with them.<ref name=\"YID_Forward\" /> In the French translation, explanations of certain features of British schools unfamiliar to French students were inserted in the dialogues (e.g., \"Prefect\" and \"Head Boy\"), but they were not distinguished from explanations in the original text of differences between ordinary British schools and wizarding schools. This could mislead readers into thinking that these features of the house and boarding systems didn't exist in real-world British schools.<ref name=\"feral\">{{citation |title= The Translator's \"Magic\" Wand: Harry Potter's Journey from English into French |author= Anne-Lise Feral |work= Translators' Journal |volume= 51 |issue= 3 |year= 2006 |pages= 459\u2013481 |url= http://www.erudit.org/revue/meta/2006/v51/n3/013553ar.pdf }}</ref>\n\nNonstandard English present in the book also had to be given careful consideration.

They just are.\"<ref name=\"YID_Forward\" /></blockquote>\n\nIn another example of making reference to cultural touchstones in translation, the \"golden snitch\" from [[Quidditch]] is rendered as \"goldene flaterl\" (golden butterfly) in the Yiddish translation, butterflies being a common symbol in Yiddish folktales.<ref name=\"tab\"/>\n\n=== Rhymes, anagrams, and acronyms ===\nThe series involves many songs, poems, and rhymes, some of which proved difficult to translators.<ref>{{cite news|author=Close |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jan/27/featuresreviews.guardianreview17 |title=Daniel Hahn: Translating involves art as well as craft |work=The Guardian |accessdate=2008-12-12 | location=London | date=2007-01-26}}</ref> One rhyme, a riddle told by a [[sphinx]] in ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', posed a particular problem.{{#tag:ref|{{cite web |url=http://www.iti.org.uk/pdfs/newPDF/HarryPotter.pdf |title=The Sphinx's Song in 13 Languages |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210034224/http://www.iti.org.uk/pdfs/newPDF/HarryPotter.pdf |archivedate=2006-02-10}}|group=\"note\"}} The riddle involves taking words from a poem and using them to form a longer word, \"spider,\" in answer to the riddle. In the Taiwanese translation, the English words are simply put in parentheses.<ref>{{cite web|author=Greg Pringle |url=http://www.cjvlang.com/Hpotter/unicode/sphinxriddle.html |title=The Sphinx's Riddle in the CJV translations of Harry Potter (Book 4) |publisher=Cjvlang.com |date= |accessdate=2008-12-12}}</ref> In other translations, the riddle is changed to provide different words that can be put together to make up the translated version of \"spider\".\n\nSome acronyms also proved difficult; the abbreviations \"O.W.L.s\" (Ordinary Wizarding Levels) and \"N.E.W.T.s\" (Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests) needed to be translated to reflect the fact that their abbreviations spelled out the names of animals associated with the wizarding world, which did not always work in other languages. \"N.E.W.T.s\" was translated into Swedish as \"F.U.T.T.\" (Fruktansv\u00e4rt Utmattande Trollkarls-Test, Terribly Exhausting Wizard's Test). \"Futt\" means \"measly\" in Swedish.<ref name=\"swedishbookreview1\" />\n\nAnother issue was the translation of \"The Mirror of Erised\", since \"''Erised''\" is created by reading English \"desire\" backwards. In German the word desire is spelled \"Begehren\", so the mirror was called \"Der Spiegel ''Nerhegeb''\". The Finnish translation also follows this formula of reversing a word; the mirror is called \"Iseeviot-peili\" \"iseeviot\" being \"toiveesi\" (\"your wish\") written backwards. In Polish the mirror is called \"Zwierciad\u0142o Ain Eingarp\" (\"zwierciad\u0142o\" = \"mirror\"; \"pragnienia\" = \"desire\" (in [[genitive case]])). In Indonesian, The Mirror of Erised is called \"Cermin Tarsah\" (cermin\" = \"mirror\"; \"hasrat\" = \"desire\"). In Spanish it is called \"El Espejo de Oesed\" (\"Espejo\" = \"Mirror\"; \"Deseo\" = \"desire\"). In the early Italian editions and in the movie, the mirror is called \"Specchio delle Brame\" (\"Mirror of Desires\"; Italian name for the [[Magic Mirror (Snow White)|Magic Mirror]] from ''[[Snow White]]''), later, it was renamed \"Specchio delle Emarb\" (\"Emarb\" is \"Brame\" read backwards), a name based on the English one.\n\nAreas in which anagrams are present do not make the transition easily into other languages. The name \"Tom Marvolo Riddle\", first mentioned in ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'', is rearranged to spell \"I am Lord Voldemort\". This has required translators to alter Riddle's name to make the anagram work. Sometimes translators manage to alter only one part of the name. For example, Tom Riddle's middle name of Marvolo was changed to ''Marvolodemus'' in the Serbian second edition; the first edition had lacked the anagram and the original name ''Tom Marvolo Riddle'' had simply been copied. In the Bulgarian translation his middle name becomes \"Mersvoluko\" so the whole name forms an anagram for \"And here I am, Lord Voldemort\" (instead of \"I am Lord Voldemort\" as in the original English). Analogous alterations of the middle name ''Marvolo'' have been made in several other languages; for example; it became ''Servoleo'' in Brazilian Portuguese, ''Vandrolo'' in Hebrew, ''Marvoldo'' in Turkish, ''Vorlost'' in German, ''Narvolo'' in Russian, ''Sorvolo'' in Spanish, ''Rojvol'' in Czech, ''Marvoloso'' in Slovak, and ''Orvoloson'' in Italian (Note: the original Italian version kept the English name, having Riddle translate the anagram in his speech that immediately follows. The change to ''Orvoloson'' was made in later editions, although the revisited translation returned to \"Marvolo\" and kept the phrase in English, assuming the reader could understand it themselves.). In the Latin version his name is ''Tom Musvox Ruddle'', which is an anagram of \"Sum Dux Voldemort\", or \"I am the leader Voldemort\".\n\nIn other languages, translators replaced the entire name to preserve the anagram. In French, Riddle's full name becomes ''Tom Elvis Jedusor'' (i.e. phonetically \"game of fate\" for the French \"Jeu du sort\", wordplay with a phonetically identical \"Jet du sort\", which means \"Casting spell\") which forms an anagram for \"Je suis Voldemort\" (\"I am Voldemort\"). In Norwegian, his name is ''Tom Dredolo Venster'', an anagram of \"Voldemort den store\", which means \"Voldemort the Great\". In Greek, his name is \"Anton Marvolo Hurt\" (\u0386\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u039c\u03b1\u03c1\u03b2\u03cc\u03bb\u03bf \u03a7\u03ad\u03c1\u03c4), anagram of \"\u0386\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd \u0392\u03cc\u03bb\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03c4\" which means \"Lord Voldemort\". In Icelandic, his name is ''Trevor Delgome'', which becomes \"(\u00c9g)Eg er Voldemort\" (\"I am Voldemort\"), but his middle name is not used for the anagram and stays as Marvolo. In Finnish his name is \"Tom Lomen Valedro\"; the corresponding anagram is \"Ma(\u00e4) olen Voldemort\", \"I am Voldemort\". In Dutch, his name is \"Marten Asmodom Vilijn\", an anagram of \"Mijn naam is Voldemort\", or \"My name is Voldemort\", \"Vilijn\" being a pseudohomophone of ''vilein'', \"evil\". In Swedish, his name is \"Tom Gus Mervolo Dolder\", an anagram of \"Ego sum Lord Voldemort\", where \"ego sum\" is Latin, not Swedish, for \"I am\". In Chinese, the mainland translator translated the two phrases without regard for the anagram, and inserted a footnote explaining the wordplay. Taiwanese, Japanese and Vietnamese followed suit. <ref name=\"cjv-anagram\">{{cite web |title=Tom Marvolo Riddle |url=http://www.cjvlang.com/Hpotter/wordplay/riddle.html |website=CJVlang.com |accessdate=29 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn Slovenian, both names are completely changed. Tom Marvolo Riddle is ''Mark Neelstin'' and Lord Voldemort is translated as ''Lord Mrlakenstein''. When the name Mark Neelstin is rearranged in the scene, it spells Mrlakenstein. Because the books in Slovenia were released with a three-year delay, the translation of Voldemort is consistent throughout the series. The film series corresponds with the book translation.\nThe Danish translation uses abbreviation and suffix to make the name work. The translation is ''Romeo G. Detlev Jr'' an anagram of \"Jeg er Voldemort\" (\"I am Voldemort\").\n\nIn Hungarian, Voldemort's name becomes \"Tom Rowle Denem\", which is an anagram of \"Nevem Voldemort\" (\"My name is Voldemort\"), with the \"w\" in the name becoming two \"v\"s. This caused a name collision with the character ''Thorfinn Rowle'', who first appears in ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', but who is not related to Voldemort. Because of this collision, in the Hungarian translation his family name was altered to Rovel. The Arabic version avoids the issue entirely by having Riddle directly write out, \"I am Lord Voldemort\" (\u0623\u0646\u0627 \u0644\u0648\u0631\u062f \u0641\u0648\u0644\u062f\u0645\u0648\u0631\u062a). These changes to the name created problems in later books however; in the English edition, a line of dialogue mentions that Tom Riddle shares his [[given name]] with the bartender of the [[The Leaky Cauldron (pub)|Leaky Cauldron]], and this becomes a plot point. However, this is not the case in all translations.\n\n=== Invented words, proper nouns, and names ===\nRowling invented a great number of words and phrases for the books such as spells, incantations, magical words, items, and place names. Many of these words involve wordplay, rhyming, and historical references that are difficult to translate. A large number of spells are drawn from or inspired by Latin, and have a certain resonance with English speakers due to its relatively large proportion of Latinate-derived vocabulary. For example, ''priori incantatem'' (a spell which causes the last spells performed by a wand to be reproduced in reverse order) would be familiar to many English-speaking readers as the words ''prior'' (previous) and ''incantation'' (spell, charm). To create a similar effect in the [[Manjul Publishing House Pvt. Ltd.|Hindi version]], the [[Sanskrit]], typical in [[mantra]]s, has been used for the spells. Some translators have created new words themselves; others have resorted to [[transliteration]].\n\nNames that involve wordplay, such as ''[[Knockturn Alley]]'' and ''[[Pensieve]]'' are also difficult to translate. The former, an unsavoury area in London's magical market, is semi-[[homophone|homophonous]] with \"nocturnally,\" suggesting darkness and evil. The latter is a magical bowl into which memories and thoughts can be placed and examined, and is a [[portmanteau]] of two words: ''pensive'', meaning \"musingly or dreamily thoughtful,\" and ''sieve'', a type of bowl with perforations through which fine particles of a substance (such as flour) may be passed to separate them from coarser ones. Translators must creatively render such names. If the words are simply transliterated, the shades of meaning are lost; but, when new word-games are invented, they can end up sounding quite different from the original, and often reflect the translator's personal interpretation and preferences. For instance, the Turkish version of ''Pensieve'' is ''D\u00fc\u015f\u00fcnseli'', which is a portmanteau of the words ''D\u00fc\u015f\u00fcnmek'' (to think, to imagine) and ''sel'' (a flood of water). The German version of ''Pensieve'' is ''Denkarium'', from ''denken'', meaning ''to think'', and the suffix ''-arium''. The Swedish version of ''Pensieve'' is ''Minness\u00e5ll'' which means ''memory's sieve''. The Norwegian translation of Pensieve is ''tanketank'' which translates to ''Thought-tank''. The Hebrew version achieves a similar effect to the English in its translation of Pensieve; ''Pensieve'' is \u05d4\u05d2\u05d9\u05d2\u05d9\u05ea (''Hagigit''), which is a combination of the word \u05d4\u05d2\u05d9\u05d2 (''hagig'') meaning ''thought'', and the word \u05d2\u05d9\u05d2\u05d9\u05ea (''gigit'') meaning ''tub''. In the Czech translation, ''Pensieve'' is \"''Mysl\u00e1nka''\" (from \"''myslet''\" \u2013 think) and ''Knockturn Alley'' is ''Obrtl\u00e1 ulice'', a rather complex neologism with many meanings and associations, but based on the word \"obrtl\u00edk\" (swivel) and the phrase \"oto\u010dit se na obrtl\u00edku\" (run away suddenly). The \"Nocturnal\" wordplay is not used in the Czech translation. The Vietnamese version of \"Pensieve\" is \"T\u01b0\u1edfng K\u00fd\", which is a combination word of \"t\u01b0 t\u01b0\u1edfng\" (\"thought\" or \"mind\") and \"k\u00fd\" (literally means something to keep thoughts, like a diary.) \n\nSimilarly, in ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone]]'', when Professor McGonagall is about to introduce Harry to Oliver Wood, she asks another professor if she can \"borrow Wood for a moment\", momentarily confusing Harry; in order to retain this wordplay, the Yiddish translation renames Wood as \"Oliver Holtz\", \"holtz\" being the Yiddish for wood<ref name=\"tab\"/>, unlike the Italian one, which changed the surname to \"Baston\", from \"bastone\", \"stick\", but returned to the original \"Wood\" with the second translation.\n\nOften, names in Harry Potter have historical or linguistic significance in English, which may create problems if the translator does not recognise or misjudges it. Rowling commented on this phenomenon in ''Conversations with J.K. Rowling'', in which she complained that the Italian translation of [[Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]]'s last name was \"Silente\"; rather than recognizing that \"Dumbledore\" was an old [[Devon]] word for \"bumblebee,\" the translator took the word \"dumb\" and translated it as \"silent\".<ref>''Conversations with J.K. Rowling'', Lindsey Fraser, Arthur E. Levine Books, 2001</ref> In contrast, the Czech translator used the Old Czech word for bumblebee \u2013 ''Brumb\u00e1l'' (in modern Czech ''\u010dmel\u00e1k''). The French translation renamed Severus Snape as \u2018Rogue\u2019; in Italian he was renamed \u2018Piton\u2019 (snake).<ref name=\"tab\">{{cite web |last1=Rosenberg |first1=Yair |title=HOW DO YOU SAY \u2018QUIDDITCH\u2019 IN YIDDISH? |url=https://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/culture-news/298268/harry-potter-translated-yiddish# |website=tabletmag.com |accessdate=13 February 2020 }}</ref>\n\n=== Plot points ===\nIn some cases, English-speaking fans have sought clues to the story's mysteries by examining the way certain parts of the books have been translated in foreign editions. A case in point is the identity of a character mentioned by initials only in the book ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]''. The English initials R.A.B. could have belonged to several minor characters from the books, but variations on the initials in other languages gave evidence to the true identity of the mystery character: in the Dutch edition of the book R.A.B. was translated into R.A.Z., 'zwart' being Dutch for 'black'; in the Norwegian edition, R.A.B. translates to 'R.A.S.', ''svart'' being Norwegian for 'black'; and in the Finnish edition the initials were R.A.M., 'musta' being Finnish for 'black'. Fans took this to mean that the character was [[Regulus Black]], the brother of [[Sirius Black]]; when ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'' was published, this was revealed to be the case.\n\nSimilarly, the title for ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'' did not make it obvious whether the word \"Order\" referred to a group of people or to a directive. The information that it was a group of people was then determined by viewing the title in other languages. The Vietnamese translation, which was originally published in instalments, originally interpreted \"Order\" as a directive and translated it as \"Harry Potter v\u00e0 M\u1ec7nh l\u1ec7nh Ph\u01b0\u1ee3ng ho\u00e0ng\"; when it became clear that \"Order\" referred to a group of people, the title was changed to \"Harry Potter v\u00e0 H\u1ed9i Ph\u01b0\u1ee3ng ho\u00e0ng\".\n\nRowling released an alternative title for ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'' for use by translators finding difficulty translating its meaning. The alternative title (in English) is ''Harry Potter and the Relics of Death''.<ref>[http://www.mugglenet.com/2007/05/swedish-deathly-hallows-translation-may-give-clues/ Swedish Deathly Hallows translation may give clues], Mugglenet, 25 May 2007</ref> In Italy the title has been translated as ''Harry Potter e i doni della morte'' replacing \"hallows\" with \"presents\" because the word \"relic\" is often used in reference to the remains or personal effects of a saint. This variation was proposed and then approved by J.K. Rowling.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.badtaste.it/2007/10/01/la-salani-chiede-aiuto-harry-potter-7/333/|title=La Salani chiede aiuto per Harry Potter 7 - BadTaste.it|date=2007-10-01|work=BadTaste.it|access-date=2018-03-08|language=it-IT}}</ref>\n\n=== Character gender ===\nA few characters in the series are identified with a title and last name, or with a gender-neutral name. In some languages\u2014for example, those where adjectives are gendered\u2014it was necessary for the translator to guess the character's gender.

K. Rowling]] is one of the [[List of literary works by number of translations|most translated series of all time]], with the first book, ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', having been translated into over 76 languages. This includes languages diverse as [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]] and [[Welsh language|Welsh]] as well as the dead languages [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek]]. This makes it the longest published work in Ancient Greek since the novels of [[Heliodorus of Emesa]] in the 3rd century AD. Additionally, regional adaptations of the books have been made to accommodate regional dialects such as the [[American English]] edition or the [[Valencian]] adaptation of [[Catalan language|Catalan]].\n\nFor reasons of secrecy, translations were only allowed to begin after each book had been published in English, creating a lag of several months for readers of other languages. Impatient fans in many places simply bought the book in English instead. In France in 2003 the fifth book, ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', became the first book in English to top the French best-seller list. Another response to this, and unavailability in certain languages, has been fans creating their own translations unofficially.\n\nInteresting issues arising in the translation of ''Harry Potter'' include cultural references, riddles, anticipating future plot points, and Rowling's creative names for characters and other elements in the magical world which often involve wordplay and descriptive phonology.\n\n== Translation process ==\nFor an authorised translation, the publisher must first negotiate and sign a contract with the author's agents, The Blair Partnership.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/links_cl.cfm |title=J.

The publishers select translators locally.\n\nTranslators were not granted access to the books before their official release date in English; hence, translation could start only after the English editions had been published, creating a lag of several months before the translations were made available. This necessary delay has boosted the sales of English language editions of the books to impatient fans, in countries where English is not the first language. Such was the clamour to read the fifth book that its English edition became the first English-language book ever to top the bookseller list in France.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/world/newsid_3036000/3036350.stm|publisher=BBC|title=OOTP is best seller in France \u2013 in English!|date=1 July 2003}}</ref> In Italy, impatient Potter fans organised \"Operation Feather\", deluging the publisher Salani with feathers (reminiscent of Hogwarts' messenger owls) to demand expedited publication for the Italian translation of the seventh and final book in the series.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/children/article2645098.ece |title=Who won the race to translate 'Harry Potter'? review &#124; Children's Books \u2013 Times Online |publisher=Times Newspapers Ltd. |date= 2007-10-12|accessdate=2008-12-12 | location=London |first1=Philippe |last1=Naughton |first2=Adam |last2=Sage}}</ref> This has also caused unauthorised translations and fake versions of the books to appear in many countries.\n\nThe high profile and demand for a high-quality local translation means that a great deal of care is often taken in the task. In some countries, such as Italy, the first book was revised by the publishers and issued in an updated edition in response to readers who complained about the quality of the first translation. In countries such as China and Portugal, the translation is conducted by a group of translators working together to save time. Some of the translators hired to work on the books were well known before their work on Harry Potter, such as [[Viktor Golyshev]], who oversaw the [[Russian language|Russian]] translation of the series' fifth book. Golyshev was previously best known for having translated [[William Faulkner]] and [[George Orwell]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Translating Harry \u2014 Part I: The Language of Magic|author=Steven Goldstein|url=http://www.globalbydesign.com/resources/articles/translating_harry_potter_part1.html|work=GlobalByDesign|year=2004|accessdate=2007-05-09|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070306025320/http://www.globalbydesign.com/resources/articles/translating_harry_potter_part1.html|archivedate=6 March 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and was known to snub the Harry Potter books in interviews and refer to them as inferior literature.

The work may be done by multiple translators to speed the process. Such translations are often poorly written and riddled with errors. Cases have occurred in many areas of the world, but China is one of the most common areas of the world for unauthorised translations and pirated editions to be sold.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-08/09/content_6500798.htm |title=Online translations of \"Harry Potter\" draw fire |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |accessdate=2008-12-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504041532/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-08/09/content_6500798.htm |archivedate=4 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}also see [[Chinese literature]], bookmarket</ref>\n\nOne notable case involved a French 16-year-old who published serialised translations of ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'' online.

The pirate translation was apparently so bad that the translator added messages, including \"Here comes something that I'm unable to translate, sorry,\" and \"I'm sorry, I didn't understand what that meant\" in some sections. Two people were arrested in connection with the pirated version.<ref>{{cite news\n | title = Potter Pirate Sorry for Mistakes | publisher = BBC News | date = 3 September 2003 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3079032.stm | accessdate = 2007-02-18 }}</ref>\n\nAnother case involved the internet [[fan translation]] community, ''Harry auf Deutsch'', formed to translate the Harry Potter books into German more rapidly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harry-auf-deutsch.de/ |title=Harry auf Deutsch :: Projekt-\u00dcbersicht der Harry Potter \u00dcbersetzung(en) |publisher=Harry-auf-deutsch.de |date= |accessdate=2008-12-12}}</ref> The German publisher of the Harry Potter books, [[Carlsen Verlag]], filed a [[cease and desist]] against the fan translators; they complied, taking down the translations.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/906048.stm |title=BBC News &#124; SCI/TECH &#124; Harry Potter and the German pirates |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2008-12-12 | date=2000-09-01}}</ref>\n\nIn some countries, when there were no authorised translations into the local language, translations not sanctioned by J.

For example, there are a number of differences in American and UK English spelling conventions; generally publishers change the spellings to conform to the expectations of their target market. Adaptation may also extend to vocabulary or grammatical choices that might impair legibility or impart some cognitive dissonance. Readers usually wouldn't be aware of the adaptations, but the choice to change the title of the American edition of the first Harry Potter book from ''Harry Potter and the '''Philosopher's''' Stone'' to ''Harry Potter and the '''Sorcerer's''' Stone'' highlighted the practice and drew considerable attention.\n\nThe book's title was changed due to the American publisher's concern that children would be confused by a reference to philosophy. Other translations have also changed the first book's title, for instance, the French translation which changed ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'' to ''Harry Potter at the School of Wizards'' for the same reason as the American translation, citing that the reference to the Philosopher's Stone legend was \"too obscure for a book aimed at the youth.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |title = The Translator's 'Magic' Wand: Harry Potter's Journey from English into French|journal = Meta : Journal des Traducteurs / Meta: Translators' Journal|volume = 51|issue = 3|pages = 459\u2013481|year = 2006|last1 = Feral|first1 = Anne-Lise|doi = 10.7202/013553ar}}</ref>\n\nOther translations also have regional adaptations that have largely gone without much notice. The Spanish translation has been adapted to three regions: Europe, Latin America and [[Southern Cone]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.potterglot.net/harry-potter-and-the-spanish-tykes/|title=Harry Potter and the Spanish Tykes|accessdate=2018-03-06}}</ref> Others translations have adaptations that were published seemingly to enhance the identity of minority communities of speakers: [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]] (an adaptation of [[Serbian language|Serbian]]) and [[Valencian]] (an adaptation of [[Catalan language|Catalan]]). It is worth noting that some translations were completed when adaptations possibly would have been sufficient; for example, any of the [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]] or [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] translations could have been adapted for each region; however, the complexities political and linguistic identity in the region probably precluded that choice.\n\nThe [[American English]] adaptations have by far received the most attention. A comprehensive list of differences between the American and British editions of the books is collected at [[the Harry Potter Lexicon]] web site.<ref>{{cite web|author=Edward Olson |url=http://www.hp-lexicon.org/about/books/cs/differences-cs.html |title=HPL: Differences: CS |publisher=Hp-lexicon.org |date= 29 October 2001|accessdate=2008-12-12}}</ref> The changes are mostly simple lexical switches to reflect [[American and British English differences|the different dialects]] and prevent American readers from stumbling over unfamiliar [[Glossary of British terms not widely used in the United States|Briticism]]s. Although it is common to adapt ''any'' text from British to American editions,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uta.fi/FAST/US1/REF/potter.html |title=FAST-US-1 Intro to American English Reference File |publisher=Uta.fi |accessdate=2008-12-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319041313/http://www15.uta.fi/FAST/US1/REF/potter.html |archivedate=19 March 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> in the case of the Harry Potter books, this standard practice has drawn criticism from readers who feel that the British English adds flavour to the series.<ref>{{cite news | last = Gleick | first = Peter H. | title = Harry Potter, Minus a Certain Flavour | work = New York Times | date = 10 July 2000 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/07/23/specials/rowling-gleick.html | accessdate = 2007-01-22 }}</ref> Rowling herself expressed regret after changing the first book's title, as the [[Philosopher's Stone]] is a legendary alchemical substance.\n\nIn an [[Associated Press]] interview, Rowling described how the alterations to the American editions came about:\n\n<blockquote>Rowling pretended to bang her head against the sofa in mock frustration. \"SO much has been made of that,\" she groans, noting that it was only done where words had been used that really meant something very different to Americans. Her American editor pointed out that the word jumper \u2013 British for pullover sweater \u2013 means a kind of dress in American. She had had no idea. \"He asked, 'Can we change it to sweater,' which is just as British?\" That was fine with Rowling.<ref>{{cite news | last = Woods | first = Audrey\n | title = Success Stuns Harry Potter Author | agency = Associated Press | date = 6 July 2000}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nPublisher Arthur Levine of [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]] explained the changes in an interview in ''[[The New Yorker]]'':\n<blockquote>I wasn't trying to, quote, \"Americanize\" them... What I was trying to do is translate, which I think is different. I wanted to make sure that an American kid reading the book would have the same literary experience that a British kid would have.\"<ref>{{cite news | last = Radosh | first = Daniel | title = Why American kids don't consider Harry Potter an insufferable prig | publisher = [[The New Yorker]] | date = 20 September 1999}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe same article, however, points out that some British dialect was retained in the books, and in some cases certain phrases were replaced with more stereotypical British phrases, such as \"spanking good\" for \"cracking.\"\n\nRegional adaptations have sometimes\u2014incorrectly\u2014been referred to as \"translations\" (as in the quote above); however, the changes in the text of an adaptation do not nearly encompass the scope of a translation. A native speaker generally would not be able to tell the difference between two adaptations without careful reading. A translation requires a translator who will be credited for the work\u2014notably, an adaptation will by performed by an editor probably with the assistance of software and the original translator will remain credited as such.\n\n== Issues in translation ==\nThe Harry Potter series presents many challenges to translators, such as rhymes, acronyms, dialects, culture, riddles, jokes, invented words, and plot points that revolve around spellings or initials. These have been dealt with by various translators with different degrees of modification to the meaning of the original text.\n\n=== Translation strategies ===\nThe books carried a number of words that are considered ''loaded names'' by linguists and translators, meaning that they carry a [[semantic]] load, and that their [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (structure) and [[phonology]] (sound) need to be adapted when translating them to a foreign language, for example the house names (Ravenclaw = [[raven]] + [[claw]]), or Voldemort's name (\"flight of death\" or \"theft of death\" in French).<ref name=\"lincoln\">{{cite journal | journal = [[New Voices in Translation Studies]] | title = Translation of Names in Children's Fantasy Literature: Bringing the Young Reader into Play | author = Lincoln Fernandes | issue = 2 | year = 2006 | url = http://www.iatis.org/newvoices/issues/2006/fernandes-paper-2006.pdf | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090419092822/http://www.iatis.org/newvoices/issues/2006/fernandes-paper-2006.pdf | archivedate = 19 April 2009 | df = dmy-all }} (page 6 on pdf)</ref> These words were translated in different countries using several translation strategies, such as ''copying'' the names with no attempt to transmit the original English meaning, ''[[transliteration|transliterating]]'' even if the name lost its original meaning, ''replacing'' the name with another given name from the target language, or ''translating'' the name using native words that conveyed the same meaning.<ref name=\"lincoln\" /><ref name=\"russian\">{{cite journal | journal = [[Meta Translators' Journal]] | title = From Harry to Garri: Strategies for the Transfer of Culture and Ideology in Russian Translations of Two English Fantasy Stories | author = Judith Inggs | volume = 48 | issue = 1\u20132 Traduction pour les enfants / Translation for children | date = May 2003 | pages = 285\u2013297 | doi=10.7202/006975ar}}</ref> For example, in the Russian first book the transliterating strategy was used for some names because the \"th\" sound does not exist in Russian, so \"Slytherin\" was transliterated as \"Slizerin\". The translator of the second book chose the translating strategy instead, and she renamed the houses, \"Hufflepuff\" becoming \"Puffendui\" and \"Ravenclaw\" becoming \"Kogtevran\" (from the Russian word for claw, \"kogot'\"). In the Italian editions, the house names were changed to animal-colour pairings: Gryffindor is \"Grifondoro\" (\"grifon d'oro\" means \"golden [[griffin]]\"), Slytherin is \"Serpeverde\" (\"serpe verde\" means \"green snake\"), Ravenclaw was, in the first edition of the first book, \"Pecoranera\" (\"pecora nera\", \"black sheep\"), but was then changed to \"Corvonero\" (\"corvo nero\", \"black raven\") and Hufflepuff is \"Tassorosso\" (\"tasso rosso\", \"red badger\") in the first translation and the films and \"Tassofrasso\" in the revisited translation<ref>https://www.potterpedia.it/?v=Traduzioni_Rivisitate:_Tassorosso_e_Tassofrasso</ref>. In the French translation, the name \"Hogwarts\" is changed to \"Poudlard\", which means \"bacon lice.\" <ref name=\"tab\"/>\n\n=== Culture and language ===\nMany of the nuances of British culture and language will be unfamiliar to international readers. Such things require careful and creative translating. For the Hebrew translation, some of the Christian references were changed, because Israelis have less familiarity with cultural Christianity than readers elsewhere: a scene in which Sirius Black sings a parody of \"[[God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen]]\" replaced the song with a parody of \"[[Hanukkah music#Mi Y'malel|Mi Y'malel]],\" a Chanukah song<ref name=\"CJN\" />; on the other hand, in the Yiddish translation, translator Arun Viswanath retained all the Christian references, feeling that his readership would be familiar enough with them.<ref name=\"YID_Forward\" /> In the French translation, explanations of certain features of British schools unfamiliar to French students were inserted in the dialogues (e.g., \"Prefect\" and \"Head Boy\"), but they were not distinguished from explanations in the original text of differences between ordinary British schools and wizarding schools. This could mislead readers into thinking that these features of the house and boarding systems didn't exist in real-world British schools.<ref name=\"feral\">{{citation |title= The Translator's \"Magic\" Wand: Harry Potter's Journey from English into French |author= Anne-Lise Feral |work= Translators' Journal |volume= 51 |issue= 3 |year= 2006 |pages= 459\u2013481 |url= http://www.erudit.org/revue/meta/2006/v51/n3/013553ar.pdf }}</ref>\n\nNonstandard English present in the book also had to be given careful consideration.

In the Taiwanese translation, the English words are simply put in parentheses.<ref>{{cite web|author=Greg Pringle |url=http://www.cjvlang.com/Hpotter/unicode/sphinxriddle.html |title=The Sphinx's Riddle in the CJV translations of Harry Potter (Book 4) |publisher=Cjvlang.com |date= |accessdate=2008-12-12}}</ref> In other translations, the riddle is changed to provide different words that can be put together to make up the translated version of \"spider\".\n\nSome acronyms also proved difficult; the abbreviations \"O.W.L.s\" (Ordinary Wizarding Levels) and \"N.E.W.T.s\" (Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests) needed to be translated to reflect the fact that their abbreviations spelled out the names of animals associated with the wizarding world, which did not always work in other languages. \"N.E.W.T.s\" was translated into Swedish as \"F.U.T.T.\" (Fruktansv\u00e4rt Utmattande Trollkarls-Test, Terribly Exhausting Wizard's Test). \"Futt\" means \"measly\" in Swedish.<ref name=\"swedishbookreview1\" />\n\nAnother issue was the translation of \"The Mirror of Erised\", since \"''Erised''\" is created by reading English \"desire\" backwards. In German the word desire is spelled \"Begehren\", so the mirror was called \"Der Spiegel ''Nerhegeb''\". The Finnish translation also follows this formula of reversing a word; the mirror is called \"Iseeviot-peili\" \"iseeviot\" being \"toiveesi\" (\"your wish\") written backwards. In Polish the mirror is called \"Zwierciad\u0142o Ain Eingarp\" (\"zwierciad\u0142o\" = \"mirror\"; \"pragnienia\" = \"desire\" (in [[genitive case]])). In Indonesian, The Mirror of Erised is called \"Cermin Tarsah\" (cermin\" = \"mirror\"; \"hasrat\" = \"desire\"). In Spanish it is called \"El Espejo de Oesed\" (\"Espejo\" = \"Mirror\"; \"Deseo\" = \"desire\"). In the early Italian editions and in the movie, the mirror is called \"Specchio delle Brame\" (\"Mirror of Desires\"; Italian name for the [[Magic Mirror (Snow White)|Magic Mirror]] from ''[[Snow White]]''), later, it was renamed \"Specchio delle Emarb\" (\"Emarb\" is \"Brame\" read backwards), a name based on the English one.\n\nAreas in which anagrams are present do not make the transition easily into other languages. The name \"Tom Marvolo Riddle\", first mentioned in ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'', is rearranged to spell \"I am Lord Voldemort\". This has required translators to alter Riddle's name to make the anagram work. Sometimes translators manage to alter only one part of the name. For example, Tom Riddle's middle name of Marvolo was changed to ''Marvolodemus'' in the Serbian second edition; the first edition had lacked the anagram and the original name ''Tom Marvolo Riddle'' had simply been copied. In the Bulgarian translation his middle name becomes \"Mersvoluko\" so the whole name forms an anagram for \"And here I am, Lord Voldemort\" (instead of \"I am Lord Voldemort\" as in the original English). Analogous alterations of the middle name ''Marvolo'' have been made in several other languages; for example; it became ''Servoleo'' in Brazilian Portuguese, ''Vandrolo'' in Hebrew, ''Marvoldo'' in Turkish, ''Vorlost'' in German, ''Narvolo'' in Russian, ''Sorvolo'' in Spanish, ''Rojvol'' in Czech, ''Marvoloso'' in Slovak, and ''Orvoloson'' in Italian (Note: the original Italian version kept the English name, having Riddle translate the anagram in his speech that immediately follows. The change to ''Orvoloson'' was made in later editions, although the revisited translation returned to \"Marvolo\" and kept the phrase in English, assuming the reader could understand it themselves.). In the Latin version his name is ''Tom Musvox Ruddle'', which is an anagram of \"Sum Dux Voldemort\", or \"I am the leader Voldemort\".\n\nIn other languages, translators replaced the entire name to preserve the anagram. In French, Riddle's full name becomes ''Tom Elvis Jedusor'' (i.e. phonetically \"game of fate\" for the French \"Jeu du sort\", wordplay with a phonetically identical \"Jet du sort\", which means \"Casting spell\") which forms an anagram for \"Je suis Voldemort\" (\"I am Voldemort\"). In Norwegian, his name is ''Tom Dredolo Venster'', an anagram of \"Voldemort den store\", which means \"Voldemort the Great\". In Greek, his name is \"Anton Marvolo Hurt\" (\u0386\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u039c\u03b1\u03c1\u03b2\u03cc\u03bb\u03bf \u03a7\u03ad\u03c1\u03c4), anagram of \"\u0386\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd \u0392\u03cc\u03bb\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03c4\" which means \"Lord Voldemort\". In Icelandic, his name is ''Trevor Delgome'', which becomes \"(\u00c9g)Eg er Voldemort\" (\"I am Voldemort\"), but his middle name is not used for the anagram and stays as Marvolo. In Finnish his name is \"Tom Lomen Valedro\"; the corresponding anagram is \"Ma(\u00e4) olen Voldemort\", \"I am Voldemort\". In Dutch, his name is \"Marten Asmodom Vilijn\", an anagram of \"Mijn naam is Voldemort\", or \"My name is Voldemort\", \"Vilijn\" being a pseudohomophone of ''vilein'', \"evil\". In Swedish, his name is \"Tom Gus Mervolo Dolder\", an anagram of \"Ego sum Lord Voldemort\", where \"ego sum\" is Latin, not Swedish, for \"I am\". In Chinese, the mainland translator translated the two phrases without regard for the anagram, and inserted a footnote explaining the wordplay. Taiwanese, Japanese and Vietnamese followed suit. <ref name=\"cjv-anagram\">{{cite web |title=Tom Marvolo Riddle |url=http://www.cjvlang.com/Hpotter/wordplay/riddle.html |website=CJVlang.com |accessdate=29 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn Slovenian, both names are completely changed. Tom Marvolo Riddle is ''Mark Neelstin'' and Lord Voldemort is translated as ''Lord Mrlakenstein''. When the name Mark Neelstin is rearranged in the scene, it spells Mrlakenstein. Because the books in Slovenia were released with a three-year delay, the translation of Voldemort is consistent throughout the series. The film series corresponds with the book translation.\nThe Danish translation uses abbreviation and suffix to make the name work. The translation is ''Romeo G. Detlev Jr'' an anagram of \"Jeg er Voldemort\" (\"I am Voldemort\").\n\nIn Hungarian, Voldemort's name becomes \"Tom Rowle Denem\", which is an anagram of \"Nevem Voldemort\" (\"My name is Voldemort\"), with the \"w\" in the name becoming two \"v\"s. This caused a name collision with the character ''Thorfinn Rowle'', who first appears in ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', but who is not related to Voldemort. Because of this collision, in the Hungarian translation his family name was altered to Rovel. The Arabic version avoids the issue entirely by having Riddle directly write out, \"I am Lord Voldemort\" (\u0623\u0646\u0627 \u0644\u0648\u0631\u062f \u0641\u0648\u0644\u062f\u0645\u0648\u0631\u062a). These changes to the name created problems in later books however; in the English edition, a line of dialogue mentions that Tom Riddle shares his [[given name]] with the bartender of the [[The Leaky Cauldron (pub)|Leaky Cauldron]], and this becomes a plot point. However, this is not the case in all translations.\n\n=== Invented words, proper nouns, and names ===\nRowling invented a great number of words and phrases for the books such as spells, incantations, magical words, items, and place names. Many of these words involve wordplay, rhyming, and historical references that are difficult to translate. A large number of spells are drawn from or inspired by Latin, and have a certain resonance with English speakers due to its relatively large proportion of Latinate-derived vocabulary. For example, ''priori incantatem'' (a spell which causes the last spells performed by a wand to be reproduced in reverse order) would be familiar to many English-speaking readers as the words ''prior'' (previous) and ''incantation'' (spell, charm). To create a similar effect in the [[Manjul Publishing House Pvt. Ltd.|Hindi version]], the [[Sanskrit]], typical in [[mantra]]s, has been used for the spells. Some translators have created new words themselves; others have resorted to [[transliteration]].\n\nNames that involve wordplay, such as ''[[Knockturn Alley]]'' and ''[[Pensieve]]'' are also difficult to translate. The former, an unsavoury area in London's magical market, is semi-[[homophone|homophonous]] with \"nocturnally,\" suggesting darkness and evil. The latter is a magical bowl into which memories and thoughts can be placed and examined, and is a [[portmanteau]] of two words: ''pensive'', meaning \"musingly or dreamily thoughtful,\" and ''sieve'', a type of bowl with perforations through which fine particles of a substance (such as flour) may be passed to separate them from coarser ones. Translators must creatively render such names. If the words are simply transliterated, the shades of meaning are lost; but, when new word-games are invented, they can end up sounding quite different from the original, and often reflect the translator's personal interpretation and preferences. For instance, the Turkish version of ''Pensieve'' is ''D\u00fc\u015f\u00fcnseli'', which is a portmanteau of the words ''D\u00fc\u015f\u00fcnmek'' (to think, to imagine) and ''sel'' (a flood of water). The German version of ''Pensieve'' is ''Denkarium'', from ''denken'', meaning ''to think'', and the suffix ''-arium''. The Swedish version of ''Pensieve'' is ''Minness\u00e5ll'' which means ''memory's sieve''. The Norwegian translation of Pensieve is ''tanketank'' which translates to ''Thought-tank''. The Hebrew version achieves a similar effect to the English in its translation of Pensieve; ''Pensieve'' is \u05d4\u05d2\u05d9\u05d2\u05d9\u05ea (''Hagigit''), which is a combination of the word \u05d4\u05d2\u05d9\u05d2 (''hagig'') meaning ''thought'', and the word \u05d2\u05d9\u05d2\u05d9\u05ea (''gigit'') meaning ''tub''. In the Czech translation, ''Pensieve'' is \"''Mysl\u00e1nka''\" (from \"''myslet''\" \u2013 think) and ''Knockturn Alley'' is ''Obrtl\u00e1 ulice'', a rather complex neologism with many meanings and associations, but based on the word \"obrtl\u00edk\" (swivel) and the phrase \"oto\u010dit se na obrtl\u00edku\" (run away suddenly). The \"Nocturnal\" wordplay is not used in the Czech translation. The Vietnamese version of \"Pensieve\" is \"T\u01b0\u1edfng K\u00fd\", which is a combination word of \"t\u01b0 t\u01b0\u1edfng\" (\"thought\" or \"mind\") and \"k\u00fd\" (literally means something to keep thoughts, like a diary.) \n\nSimilarly, in ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone]]'', when Professor McGonagall is about to introduce Harry to Oliver Wood, she asks another professor if she can \"borrow Wood for a moment\", momentarily confusing Harry; in order to retain this wordplay, the Yiddish translation renames Wood as \"Oliver Holtz\", \"holtz\" being the Yiddish for wood<ref name=\"tab\"/>, unlike the Italian one, which changed the surname to \"Baston\", from \"bastone\", \"stick\", but returned to the original \"Wood\" with the second translation.\n\nOften, names in Harry Potter have historical or linguistic significance in English, which may create problems if the translator does not recognise or misjudges it. Rowling commented on this phenomenon in ''Conversations with J.K. Rowling'', in which she complained that the Italian translation of [[Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]]'s last name was \"Silente\"; rather than recognizing that \"Dumbledore\" was an old [[Devon]] word for \"bumblebee,\" the translator took the word \"dumb\" and translated it as \"silent\".<ref>''Conversations with J.K. Rowling'', Lindsey Fraser, Arthur E. Levine Books, 2001</ref> In contrast, the Czech translator used the Old Czech word for bumblebee \u2013 ''Brumb\u00e1l'' (in modern Czech ''\u010dmel\u00e1k''). The French translation renamed Severus Snape as \u2018Rogue\u2019; in Italian he was renamed \u2018Piton\u2019 (snake).<ref name=\"tab\">{{cite web |last1=Rosenberg |first1=Yair |title=HOW DO YOU SAY \u2018QUIDDITCH\u2019 IN YIDDISH? |url=https://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/culture-news/298268/harry-potter-translated-yiddish# |website=tabletmag.com |accessdate=13 February 2020 }}</ref>\n\n=== Plot points ===\nIn some cases, English-speaking fans have sought clues to the story's mysteries by examining the way certain parts of the books have been translated in foreign editions. A case in point is the identity of a character mentioned by initials only in the book ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]''. The English initials R.A.B. could have belonged to several minor characters from the books, but variations on the initials in other languages gave evidence to the true identity of the mystery character: in the Dutch edition of the book R.A.B. was translated into R.A.Z., 'zwart' being Dutch for 'black'; in the Norwegian edition, R.A.B. translates to 'R.A.S.', ''svart'' being Norwegian for 'black'; and in the Finnish edition the initials were R.A.M., 'musta' being Finnish for 'black'. Fans took this to mean that the character was [[Regulus Black]], the brother of [[Sirius Black]]; when ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'' was published, this was revealed to be the case.\n\nSimilarly, the title for ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'' did not make it obvious whether the word \"Order\" referred to a group of people or to a directive. The information that it was a group of people was then determined by viewing the title in other languages. The Vietnamese translation, which was originally published in instalments, originally interpreted \"Order\" as a directive and translated it as \"Harry Potter v\u00e0 M\u1ec7nh l\u1ec7nh Ph\u01b0\u1ee3ng ho\u00e0ng\"; when it became clear that \"Order\" referred to a group of people, the title was changed to \"Harry Potter v\u00e0 H\u1ed9i Ph\u01b0\u1ee3ng ho\u00e0ng\".\n\nRowling released an alternative title for ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'' for use by translators finding difficulty translating its meaning. The alternative title (in English) is ''Harry Potter and the Relics of Death''.<ref>[http://www.mugglenet.com/2007/05/swedish-deathly-hallows-translation-may-give-clues/ Swedish Deathly Hallows translation may give clues], Mugglenet, 25 May 2007</ref> In Italy the title has been translated as ''Harry Potter e i doni della morte'' replacing \"hallows\" with \"presents\" because the word \"relic\" is often used in reference to the remains or personal effects of a saint. This variation was proposed and then approved by J.K. Rowling.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.badtaste.it/2007/10/01/la-salani-chiede-aiuto-harry-potter-7/333/|title=La Salani chiede aiuto per Harry Potter 7 - BadTaste.it|date=2007-10-01|work=BadTaste.it|access-date=2018-03-08|language=it-IT}}</ref>\n\n=== Character gender ===\nA few characters in the series are identified with a title and last name, or with a gender-neutral name. In some languages\u2014for example, those where adjectives are gendered\u2014it was necessary for the translator to guess the character's gender.

Third, 1.3% of HIV cases were transmitted through injected drug use.\nDespite easy access to HIV blood testing in Belgium, 36% of new cases are diagnosed at late stage of the disease. Late diagnosis is more frequent in the heterosexual population (46%) than in MSM group (27%).\nUnlike other countries in Europe, Belgium offers HIV testing by all practitioners, clinics, hospitals, and student services. Most diagnosis centers offer rapid and/or 4th generation testing without any costs and anonymously.\n\n97% of diagnosed patients have access to adequate therapy, with viral charge being undetectable in the blood (uninfectious status) and stopping the spread of the disease.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.25608/C57T-F917\n\n== Czech Republic ==\nAs of 31 December 2018, there are 3,368 HIV-positive people diagnosed in the Czech Republic, the overall count\u2014including foreigners (446 people)\u2014is then 3,814 people.

Although Bosnia has free HIV therapy and medicaments, the biggest problem is that there is no access to modern medicaments that are available in some other European countries for example Germany, Austria, France etc.\n\n== Belgium ==\nBelgium had a total of 18,908 HIV  cases by the end of 2017 (not taking into account the people who are not aware of their infection).\nPrevalence is 1.7 cases per 1000 inhabitants.\n\n2.4 new cases are diagnosed daily.\nMost of the newly diagnosed cases were transmitted through heterosexual contact, 49.6%. Secondly, HIV cases transmitted through sexual contact among men having sex with men (MSM) were at 46.6%. Third, 1.3% of HIV cases were transmitted through injected drug use.\nDespite easy access to HIV blood testing in Belgium, 36% of new cases are diagnosed at late stage of the disease. Late diagnosis is more frequent in the heterosexual population (46%) than in MSM group (27%).\nUnlike other countries in Europe, Belgium offers HIV testing by all practitioners, clinics, hospitals, and student services. Most diagnosis centers offer rapid and/or 4th generation testing without any costs and anonymously.\n\n97% of diagnosed patients have access to adequate therapy, with viral charge being undetectable in the blood (uninfectious status) and stopping the spread of the disease.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.25608/C57T-F917\n\n== Czech Republic ==\nAs of 31 December 2018, there are 3,368 HIV-positive people diagnosed in the Czech Republic, the overall count\u2014including foreigners (446 people)\u2014is then 3,814 people. In 2018, this number increased by 208.\nThe most affected area is the city of Prague (1651 cases). Since 1994, the Czech Republic has performed 28.8 million HIV tests. 415,813 people have received examinations at their own request. 75% of test recipients indicated that the reason for seeking a test was that they were a man who had sex with men.\nAIDS outbreak at 506 people (as of 31 December 2016, The statistics led from 1 October 1985), of which 255 of them died.\nThe average age of diagnosis is 35 years for men and 39 years for women.\nIn 2018 there was a decrease in diagnoses.

Unlike Van Nuys, he is a supporter of reciprocal trade pacts but shares his suspicion of the President. A simple, confused, but very honest Presbyterian of considerable character, he views the corn interest, which he represents, with an almost religious devotion. He leads the Senate Lobby interested in producing synthetic rubber out of corn, and coming from the Republican corn belt, is virtually a Republican in sentiment and conduct.

Unlike Van Nuys, he is a supporter of reciprocal trade pacts but shares his suspicion of the President. A simple, confused, but very honest Presbyterian of considerable character, he views the corn interest, which he represents, with an almost religious devotion. He leads the Senate Lobby interested in producing synthetic rubber out of corn, and coming from the Republican corn belt, is virtually a Republican in sentiment and conduct.

More complex games, moderated entirely or partially by computer programs, were pioneered by [[Rick Loomis]] of [[Flying Buffalo]] in  1970.  The first such game offered via major email services was ''[[WebWar II]]'' (based on Starweb and licensed from Flying Buffalo) from Neolithic Enterprises who accepted email turns from all of the major email services including [[CompuServe]] in 1983.\n\nPlay by mail games are often referred to as PBM games, and play by email is sometimes abbreviated PBeM\u2014as opposed to face to face (FTF) or over the board (OTB) games which are played in person. Another variation on the name is [[play-by-Internet]] (PBI) or play-by-web (PBW). In all of these examples, player instructions can be either executed by a human moderator, a computer program, or a combination of the two.\n\nIn the 1980s, play-by-mail games reached their peak of popularity with the advent of ''[[Gaming Universal]]'', ''[[Paper Mayhem]]'' and ''[[Flagship magazine]]'', the first professional magazines devoted to play-by-mail games. (An earlier fanzine, ''[[The Nuts & Bolts of PBM]]'', was the first publication to exclusively cover the hobby.) Bob McLain, the publisher and editor of Gaming Universal, further popularized the hobby by writing articles that appeared in many of the leading mainstream gaming magazines of the time. Flagship later bought overseas right to Gaming Universal, making it the leading magazine in the field. ''Flagship magazine'' was founded by Chris Harvey and [[Nick Palmer]]. \n\nIn the late 1990s, computer and Internet games marginalized play-by-mail conducted by actual postal mail, but the postal hobby still exists with an estimated 2000\u20133000 adherents worldwide.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Postcard-for-correspondence-chess (trimmed image).png|thumb|right|Postcard for international correspondence chess]]\nThe earliest play-by-mail games developed as a way for geographically separated gamers to compete with each other using [[postal mail]]. [[Chess]] is the oldest example of this type. It has been played for hundreds of years in various countries by mail. In this two player game, players send moves directly to each other. Multi-player games emerged later. ''[[Diplomacy (game)|Diplomacy]]'' is an example of this type in which a central [[game master]] manages the game, receiving moves and publishing adjudications. ''Diplomacy'' was first played by mail in 1963.<ref name=babcock/> In the early 1970s, in the United States, [[Rick Loomis]], of [[Flying Buffalo Inc]], began a number of multi-player play-by-mail games;<ref>{{Cite journal |first= Rick|last= Loomis|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2013|month= |title= Letter from Rick Loomis to the Play By Mail/Email/Web/Turn Based Games Community |journal= Suspense and Decision|volume= December 2013|issue= No. 2|pages= 38|id= |url= http://playbymail.net/SuspenseAndDecision/Issue2.pdf |accessdate= March 20, 2020|quote= }}</ref> this included games such as ''[[Nuclear Destruction (play-by-mail)|Nuclear Destruction]]'', which launched in 1970.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.flyingbuffalo.com/nucdest.htm|title= Nuclear Destruction|author= |date= |work= Flying Buffalo, Inc|publisher= Flying Buffalo, Inc|accessdate= March 27, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThis began the professional PBM industry in the United States. Professional game moderation started in 1971 at Flying Buffalo which added games such as [[Battleplan (play-by-mail game)|''Battleplan'']], ''[[Heroic Fantasy]]'', ''[[Starweb]]'', and others, which by the late 1980s were all computer moderated.<ref name=Townsend>{{cite magazine |last= Townsend|first= Jim|date= 1988|title= The PBM Corner|url= |magazine= [[White Wolf]]|location= |publisher= | issue = 11|page= 20|access-date=}}</ref> For approximately five years, Flying Buffalo was the single dominant company in the US PBM industry until [[Schubel & Son]] entered the field in \"roughly\" 1976 with the human-moderated ''[[The Tribes of Crane|Tribes of Crane]]'' game.<ref name=Townsend/> Schubel & Son introduced fee structure innovations which allowed players to pay additional fees for additional options or special actions outside of the rules. This provided players with larger bankrolls the advantage or the ability to abuse game systems.<ref name=Townsend/>\n\nThe next \"big entrance\" was [[Superior Simulations]] with its game ''[[Empyrean Challenge]]'' in 1978.<ref name=Townsend/> Reviewer Jim Townsend asserted that it was \"the most complex game system on Earth\" with some large position turn results 1,000 pages in length.<ref name=Townsend/> By 1980, the PBM field was growing but still nascent: there were still only two sizable commercial PBM companies, and only a few small ones.<ref name=Poplizio>{{cite magazine |last1= Popolizio|first1= Mike |last2= LeBlanc|first2= Liz |last3= Popolizio|first3= Marti |date= 1990|title= Revamping a Classic!

According to Jim Townsend: <blockquote>In the late 70's and all of the 80's, many small PBM firms have opened their doors and better than 90% of them have failed. Although PBM is an easy industry to get into, staying in business is another thing entirely. Literally hundreds of PBM companies have come and gone, most of them taking the money of would-be-customers with them.<ref name=Townsend/></blockquote>\n\nTownsend emphasized the risks for the PBM industry in that \"The new PBM company has such a small chance of surviving that no insurance company would write a policy to cover them. Skydivers are a better risk.\"<ref name=Townsend89>{{cite magazine |last= Townsend|first= Jim|date= February 1989|title= The PBM Corner|url= |magazine= [[White Wolf Magazine]]|location= |publisher= | issue = 14|page= 55|access-date=}}</ref> By the late 1980s, of the more than one hundred play-by-mail companies operating, the majority were hobbies\u2013not run as business to make money.<ref name=Townsend12>{{cite magazine |last= Townsend|first= Jim|date= |title= The PBM Corner|url= |magazine= [[White Wolf Magazine]]|location= |publisher= | issue = 12|page= 19|access-date=}}</ref> Jim Townsend estimated that, in 1988, there were about a dozen profitable PBM companies in the United States\u2014with an additional few in the [[United Kingdom]] and the same in [[Australia]].<ref name=Townsend12/>\n\nThe proliferation of PBM companies in the 1980s supported the publication of a number of newsletters from individual play-by-mail companies as well as independent publications such as ''[[Gaming Universal]]'', ''[[Paper Mayhem]]'', and [[Flagship Magazine|''Flagship'']] which focused solely on the play-by-mail gaming industry.  \n\nThe 1990s brought the onset of the digital age of computers, with many gamers shifting to digital platforms versus play-by-mail games.

An average PBM game has 10\u201320 players in it, but there are also games that have hundreds of players. Turn around time is the length of time it takes to get your turn back from a company. The average turnaround time is 2 weeks. Some games never end. They can go on virtually forever or until you decide to drop. Many games have victory conditions that can be achieved within a year or two. Prices vary for the different PBM games, but the average price per turn [in 1993] is about $5.00.<ref name=frontmatter/></blockquote>\n\n===Mechanics===\nAfter the initial setup of a PBM game, players begin submitting turn orders.

To some degree this was an economic decision, as computers allowed the processing of more turns than humans, but with less of a human touch in the prose of a turn result. According to John Kevin Loth III, 100 percent computer moderated games would also kill a players \"character or empire\" emotionlessly, regardless of effort invested.<ref name=Loth86/> Alternatively, Loth noted that those preferring exquisite pages of prose would gravitate toward 100 percent human moderation.<ref name=Loth86/> Loth provided ''Beyond the Quadra Zone'' and ''Earthwood'' as popular computer moderated examples in 1986 and ''Silverdawn'' and ''Sword Lords'' as 100 percent human moderated examples of the period.<ref name=Loth86/>\n\n==Play-by-email==\nWith the rise of the [[Internet]], [[email]] and [[websites]] have largely replaced postal gaming and postal games zines. Play-by-email (PBEM) games differ from popular online multiplayer games in that, for most computerized multiplayer games, the players have to be online at the same time - also known as synchronous play. With a play-by-mail game, the players can play whenever they choose, since responses need not be immediate; this is sometimes referred to as [[turn-based gaming]] and is common among [[Browser game|browser-based]] games.  Some [[video game]]s can be played in turn-based mode: one player makes a move, declaring it by email, and then the turn passes to another player who makes his or her move. Depending on the game, a PBEM Aide may be available as an alternative to describing the move with text. Such an aide generally consists of a picture of the board along with movable playing pieces, cards, etc. A player moves the pieces as desired and then can either save a static picture of the new game state, or a replay sequentially showing all changes that transpired during his turn, and send this to his opponent.\n\nSeveral non-commercial email games played on the [[Internet]] and [[BITNET]] predate these.{{Examples|plural|date=July 2015}} Some cards games like poker can also be played by email using cryptography, such as with [[FXTOP]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pele.org/cryptopoker/patent_long_distance_card_game_without_any_intermediate_english_version_WO02085475A2.pdf |title=cryptopoker.fr Secured software and process to play long distance poker without any intermediate or third party |website=Pele.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-08}}</ref>{{irrelevant citation|date=June 2017|reason=aaa}}\n\n==Play-by-web==\nAn increasingly popular format for play-by-email games is play-by-web. As with play-by-email games the players are notified by email when it becomes their turn, but they must then return to the game's website to continue playing. The game may be either [[Browser game|browser-based]] or a [[video game]]. The main advantage of this is that the players can be presented with a graphical representation of the game and an interactive interface to guide them through their turn. Since the notifications only have to remind the players that it is their turn they can just as easily be sent via [[Instant messenger|instant messaging]].\n\nSome sites have extended this gaming style by allowing the players to see each other's actions as they are made. This allows for real time playing while everyone is online and active, or slower progress if not.\n\nIncreasingly, this format is being adopted by social and mobile games, often described using the term \"asynchronous multiplayer\".\n\nSome video games, such as [[Civilization (series)|Civilization]], are suitable for being played either play-by-web via separate client software or play-by-email sending game save packages from one player to another.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of play-by-mail games]]\n* [[Play-by-post role-playing game]]\n* [[Turn-based]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web |url= http://suspense-and-decision.com/|title= Suspense and Decision Magazine: A PBM magazine for the 21st Century!|author= |date= 2019|publisher=  www.playbymail.net|accessdate= January 21, 2020}}\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=wMWvRHsEnP8C&lpg=PA220&ots=LNSkvZD7QN&dq=pbem%20game%20magazine&pg=PA220#v=onepage&q=pbem%20game%20magazine&f=true Readers Digest 1,001 Computer Hints and Tips]\n\n[[Category:Correspondence chess]]\n[[Category:Game terminology]]\n[[Category:Play-by-email video games| ]]\n[[Category:Play-by-mail games| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{Original research|date=August 2019}}\n\n'''Play-by-mail games''', or '''play-by-post games''', are [[game]]s, of any type, played through postal [[mail]] or [[email]].\n\n[[Correspondence chess]] has been played by mail for centuries.

More complex games, moderated entirely or partially by computer programs, were pioneered by [[Rick Loomis]] of [[Flying Buffalo]] in  1970.  The first such game offered via major email services was ''[[WebWar II]]'' (based on Starweb and licensed from Flying Buffalo) from Neolithic Enterprises who accepted email turns from all of the major email services including [[CompuServe]] in 1983.\n\nPlay by mail games are often referred to as PBM games, and play by email is sometimes abbreviated PBeM\u2014as opposed to face to face (FTF) or over the board (OTB) games which are played in person. Another variation on the name is [[play-by-Internet]] (PBI) or play-by-web (PBW). In all of these examples, player instructions can be either executed by a human moderator, a computer program, or a combination of the two.\n\nIn the 1980s, play-by-mail games reached their peak of popularity with the advent of ''[[Gaming Universal]]'', ''[[Paper Mayhem]]'' and ''[[Flagship magazine]]'', the first professional magazines devoted to play-by-mail games. (An earlier fanzine, ''[[The Nuts & Bolts of PBM]]'', was the first publication to exclusively cover the hobby.) Bob McLain, the publisher and editor of Gaming Universal, further popularized the hobby by writing articles that appeared in many of the leading mainstream gaming magazines of the time. Flagship later bought overseas right to Gaming Universal, making it the leading magazine in the field. ''Flagship magazine'' was founded by Chris Harvey and [[Nick Palmer]]. \n\nIn the late 1990s, computer and Internet games marginalized play-by-mail conducted by actual postal mail, but the postal hobby still exists with an estimated 2000\u20133000 adherents worldwide.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Postcard-for-correspondence-chess (trimmed image).png|thumb|right|Postcard for international correspondence chess]]\nThe earliest play-by-mail games developed as a way for geographically separated gamers to compete with each other using [[postal mail]]. [[Chess]] is the oldest example of this type. It has been played for hundreds of years in various countries by mail. In this two player game, players send moves directly to each other. Multi-player games emerged later. ''[[Diplomacy (game)|Diplomacy]]'' is an example of this type in which a central [[game master]] manages the game, receiving moves and publishing adjudications. ''Diplomacy'' was first played by mail in 1963.<ref name=babcock/> In the early 1970s, in the United States, [[Rick Loomis]], of [[Flying Buffalo Inc]], began a number of multi-player play-by-mail games;<ref>{{Cite journal |first= Rick|last= Loomis|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2013|month= |title= Letter from Rick Loomis to the Play By Mail/Email/Web/Turn Based Games Community |journal= Suspense and Decision|volume= December 2013|issue= No. 2|pages= 38|id= |url= http://playbymail.net/SuspenseAndDecision/Issue2.pdf |accessdate= March 20, 2020|quote= }}</ref> this included games such as ''[[Nuclear Destruction (play-by-mail)|Nuclear Destruction]]'', which launched in 1970.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.flyingbuffalo.com/nucdest.htm|title= Nuclear Destruction|author= |date= |work= Flying Buffalo, Inc|publisher= Flying Buffalo, Inc|accessdate= March 27, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThis began the professional PBM industry in the United States. Professional game moderation started in 1971 at Flying Buffalo which added games such as [[Battleplan (play-by-mail game)|''Battleplan'']], ''[[Heroic Fantasy]]'', ''[[Starweb]]'', and others, which by the late 1980s were all computer moderated.<ref name=Townsend>{{cite magazine |last= Townsend|first= Jim|date= 1988|title= The PBM Corner|url= |magazine= [[White Wolf]]|location= |publisher= | issue = 11|page= 20|access-date=}}</ref> For approximately five years, Flying Buffalo was the single dominant company in the US PBM industry until [[Schubel & Son]] entered the field in \"roughly\" 1976 with the human-moderated ''[[The Tribes of Crane|Tribes of Crane]]'' game.<ref name=Townsend/> Schubel & Son introduced fee structure innovations which allowed players to pay additional fees for additional options or special actions outside of the rules. This provided players with larger bankrolls the advantage or the ability to abuse game systems.<ref name=Townsend/>\n\nThe next \"big entrance\" was [[Superior Simulations]] with its game ''[[Empyrean Challenge]]'' in 1978.<ref name=Townsend/> Reviewer Jim Townsend asserted that it was \"the most complex game system on Earth\" with some large position turn results 1,000 pages in length.<ref name=Townsend/> By 1980, the PBM field was growing but still nascent: there were still only two sizable commercial PBM companies, and only a few small ones.<ref name=Poplizio>{{cite magazine |last1= Popolizio|first1= Mike |last2= LeBlanc|first2= Liz |last3= Popolizio|first3= Marti |date= 1990|title= Revamping a Classic!

According to Jim Townsend: <blockquote>In the late 70's and all of the 80's, many small PBM firms have opened their doors and better than 90% of them have failed. Although PBM is an easy industry to get into, staying in business is another thing entirely. Literally hundreds of PBM companies have come and gone, most of them taking the money of would-be-customers with them.<ref name=Townsend/></blockquote>\n\nTownsend emphasized the risks for the PBM industry in that \"The new PBM company has such a small chance of surviving that no insurance company would write a policy to cover them. Skydivers are a better risk.\"<ref name=Townsend89>{{cite magazine |last= Townsend|first= Jim|date= February 1989|title= The PBM Corner|url= |magazine= [[White Wolf Magazine]]|location= |publisher= | issue = 14|page= 55|access-date=}}</ref> By the late 1980s, of the more than one hundred play-by-mail companies operating, the majority were hobbies\u2013not run as business to make money.<ref name=Townsend12>{{cite magazine |last= Townsend|first= Jim|date= |title= The PBM Corner|url= |magazine= [[White Wolf Magazine]]|location= |publisher= | issue = 12|page= 19|access-date=}}</ref> Jim Townsend estimated that, in 1988, there were about a dozen profitable PBM companies in the United States\u2014with an additional few in the [[United Kingdom]] and the same in [[Australia]].<ref name=Townsend12/>\n\nThe proliferation of PBM companies in the 1980s supported the publication of a number of newsletters from individual play-by-mail companies as well as independent publications such as ''[[Gaming Universal]]'', ''[[Paper Mayhem]]'', and [[Flagship Magazine|''Flagship'']] which focused solely on the play-by-mail gaming industry.  \n\nThe 1990s brought the onset of the digital age of computers, with many gamers shifting to digital platforms versus play-by-mail games. But with the shift to the digital age has come new opportunities as well.

Such an aide generally consists of a picture of the board along with movable playing pieces, cards, etc. A player moves the pieces as desired and then can either save a static picture of the new game state, or a replay sequentially showing all changes that transpired during his turn, and send this to his opponent.\n\nSeveral non-commercial email games played on the [[Internet]] and [[BITNET]] predate these.{{Examples|plural|date=July 2015}} Some cards games like poker can also be played by email using cryptography, such as with [[FXTOP]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pele.org/cryptopoker/patent_long_distance_card_game_without_any_intermediate_english_version_WO02085475A2.pdf |title=cryptopoker.fr Secured software and process to play long distance poker without any intermediate or third party |website=Pele.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-08}}</ref>{{irrelevant citation|date=June 2017|reason=aaa}}\n\n==Play-by-web==\nAn increasingly popular format for play-by-email games is play-by-web. As with play-by-email games the players are notified by email when it becomes their turn, but they must then return to the game's website to continue playing. The game may be either [[Browser game|browser-based]] or a [[video game]]. The main advantage of this is that the players can be presented with a graphical representation of the game and an interactive interface to guide them through their turn. Since the notifications only have to remind the players that it is their turn they can just as easily be sent via [[Instant messenger|instant messaging]].\n\nSome sites have extended this gaming style by allowing the players to see each other's actions as they are made. This allows for real time playing while everyone is online and active, or slower progress if not.\n\nIncreasingly, this format is being adopted by social and mobile games, often described using the term \"asynchronous multiplayer\".\n\nSome video games, such as [[Civilization (series)|Civilization]], are suitable for being played either play-by-web via separate client software or play-by-email sending game save packages from one player to another.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of play-by-mail games]]\n* [[Play-by-post role-playing game]]\n* [[Turn-based]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web |url= http://suspense-and-decision.com/|title= Suspense and Decision Magazine: A PBM magazine for the 21st Century!|author= |date= 2019|publisher=  www.playbymail.net|accessdate= January 21, 2020}}\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=wMWvRHsEnP8C&lpg=PA220&ots=LNSkvZD7QN&dq=pbem%20game%20magazine&pg=PA220#v=onepage&q=pbem%20game%20magazine&f=true Readers Digest 1,001 Computer Hints and Tips]\n\n[[Category:Correspondence chess]]\n[[Category:Game terminology]]\n[[Category:Play-by-email video games| ]]\n[[Category:Play-by-mail games| ]]\n", "name_user": "Airborne84", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eClosed versus open ended", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play-by-mail_game"}

It is most commonly used to protect, color, or provide texture to objects. Paint can be made or purchased in many colors\u2014and in many different types, such as watercolor or synthetic. Paint is typically stored, sold, and applied as a liquid, but most types dry into a solid. Most paints are either oil-based or water-based and each have distinct characteristics. For one, it is illegal in most municipalities to discard oil based paint down household drains or sewers. Solvents for clean up are also different for water based paint than they are for oil based paint.<ref>https://www.hgtv.com/design/decorating/design-101/painting-101-oil-or-latex</ref> Water-based paints and oil-based paints will cure differently based on the outside ambient temperature of the object being painted (such as a house.)

The Egyptians mixed their colors with a gummy substance and applied them separately from each other without any blending or mixture. They appear to have used six colors: white, black, blue, red, yellow, and green. They first covered the area entirely with white, then traced the design in black, leaving out the lights of the ground color. They used [[lead tetroxide|minium]] for red, generally of a dark tinge.\n\n[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] mentions some painted ceilings in his day in the town of [[Ardea (RM)|Ardea]], which had been made prior to the foundation of [[Rome]]. He expressed great surprise and admiration at their freshness, after the lapse of so many centuries.\n\nPaint was made with the yolk of [[Egg (food)|eggs]] and therefore, the substance would harden and adhere to the surface it was applied to. Pigment was made from plants, sand, and different soils. Most paints used either oil or water as a [[Binder (material)|base]] (the diluent, solvent or vehicle for the pigment).\n\nA still extant example of 17th-century house oil painting is [[Ham House]] in [[Surrey]], [[England]], where a primer was used along with several undercoats and an elaborate decorative overcoat; the pigment and oil mixture would have been ground into a paste with a mortar and pestle. The process was done by hand by the painters, which exposed them to lead poisoning, due to the white-lead powder.\n\nIn 1718, Marshall Smith invented a \"Machine or Engine for the Grinding of Colours\" in England. It is not known precisely how it operated, but it was a device that increased the efficiency of pigment grinding dramatically. Soon, a company called Emerton and Manby was advertising exceptionally low-priced paints that had been ground with labour-saving technology:\n:''One Pound of Colour ground in a Horse-Mill will paint twelve Yards of Work, whereas Colour ground any other Way, will not do half that Quantity.''\nBy the proper onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]], in the mid-18th century, paint was being ground in steam-powered mills, and an alternative to lead-based pigments had been found in a white derivative of zinc oxide. Interior house painting increasingly became the norm as the 19th century progressed, both for decorative reasons and because the paint was effective in preventing the walls rotting from damp. Linseed oil was also increasingly used as an inexpensive binder.\n\nIn 1866, [[Sherwin-Williams]] in the [[United States]] opened as a large paint-maker and invented a paint that could be used from the tin without preparation.\n\nIt was not until the stimulus of [[World War II]] created a shortage of linseed oil in the supply market that artificial resins, or alkyds, were invented. Cheap and easy to make, they also held the color well and lasted for a long time.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/pages/arts/design/index.html ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref>{{failed verification|date=December 2015}}{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n==Components==\n\n===Vehicle===\nThe vehicle is composed of the binder; or, if it is necessary to thin the binder with a diluent like solvent or water, it is the combination of binder and diluent.<ref name=\"Wicks_5\">{{cite book|last1=Wicks|first1=Zeno W., Jr.|last2=Jones|first2=Frank N.|last3=Pappas|first3=S.

Thus, an important quantity in coatings formulation is the \"vehicle solids\", sometimes called the \"resin solids\" of the formula. This is the proportion of the wet coating weight that is binder, i.e. the polymer backbone of the film that will remain after drying or curing is complete.\n\n====Binder or film former====\nThe binder is the film-forming component of paint.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Vermeer's Palette: The Anatomy of Pigment and Binder|url = http://www.essentialvermeer.com/palette/palette_anatomy_of_paint.html#.VieiDCvQO6I|website = www.essentialvermeer.com|accessdate = 2015-10-21}}</ref> It is the only component that is always present among all the various types of formulations. Many binders are too thick to be applied and must be thinned. The type of thinner, if present, varies with the binder.\n\nThe binder imparts properties such as gloss, durability, flexibility, and toughness.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sGQdBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA101&dq=The+binder+gives+properties+such+as+gloss,+durability,+flexibility,+and+toughness.#v=onepage&q=The%20binder%20gives%20properties%20such%20as%20gloss,%20durability,%20flexibility,%20and%20toughness.&f=false|title=CourseSmart International E-Book for Environmental Chemistry|last=Baird|first=Colin|last2=Cann|first2=Michael|date=2012-06-30|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9781464162879|language=en}}</ref>\n\nBinders include synthetic or natural resins such as [[alkyd]]s, [[acrylic resin|acrylic]]s, vinyl-acrylics, vinyl acetate/ethylene (VAE), [[polyurethane]]s, [[polyester]]s, [[melamine resin]]s, [[epoxy]], silanes or siloxanes or [[Oil paint|oil]]s.\n\nBinders can be categorized according to the mechanisms for film formation. Thermoplastic mechanisms include drying and coalescence. Drying refers to simple evaporation of the solvent or thinner to leave a coherent film behind. Coalescence refers to a mechanism that involves drying followed by actual interpenetration and fusion of formerly discrete particles. Thermoplastic film-forming mechanisms are sometimes described as \"thermoplastic cure\" but that is a misnomer because no chemical curing reactions are required to knit the film. Thermosetting mechanisms, on the other hand, are true curing mechanism that involve chemical reaction(s) among the polymers that make up the binder.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Baghdachi|first1=J.|title=Polymer Systems and Film Formation Mechanisms in HIgh Solids, Powder and UV Cure Systems.|url=http://www.swst.org/meetings/AM04/Baghdachi.pdf|website=Society of Wood Science and Technology|publisher=Society of Wood Science and Technology|accessdate=2016-01-13}}</ref>\n\n'''Thermoplastic mechanisms''': Some films are formed by simple cooling of the binder. For example, [[Encaustic painting|encaustic]] or [[wax]] paints are liquid when warm, and harden upon cooling. In many cases, they resoften or liquify if reheated.\n\nPaints that dry by solvent evaporation and contain the solid binder dissolved in a solvent are known as lacquers. A solid film forms when the solvent evaporates. Because no chemical crosslinking is involved, the film can re-dissolve in solvent; as such, lacquers are unsuitable for applications where chemical resistance is important. Classic [[nitrocellulose]] lacquers fall into this category, as do non-grain raising stains composed of [[dyes]] dissolved in solvent. Performance varies by formulation, but lacquers generally tend to have better [[UV coating|UV resistance]] and lower corrosion resistance than comparable systems that cure by polymerization or coalescence.\n\nThe paint type known as [[Emulsion]] in the UK and [[Latex]] in the United States is a water-borne dispersion of sub-micrometer polymer particles. These terms in their respective countries cover all paints that use synthetic polymers such as acrylic, vinyl acrylic ([[Polyvinyl acetate|PVA]]), styrene acrylic, etc. as binders.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dundean.com/tips_what_is_latex_paint.shtml |title=Water-based Alchemy |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}</ref> The term \"latex\" in the context of paint in the United States simply means an aqueous dispersion; [[latex]] rubber from the rubber tree is not an ingredient. These dispersions are prepared by [[emulsion polymerization]]. Such paints cure by a process called coalescence where first the water, and then the trace, or coalescing, solvent, evaporate and draw together and soften the  binder particles and fuse them together into irreversibly bound networked structures, so that the paint cannot redissolve in the solvent/water that originally carried it. The residual [[surfactants in paint]], as well as [[Hydrolysis|hydrolytic]] effects with some polymers cause the paint to remain susceptible to softening and, over time, degradation by water. The general term of latex paint is usually used in the United States, while the term emulsion paint is used for the same products in the UK and the term latex paint is not used at all.\n\n'''Thermosetting mechanisms''': Paints that cure by polymerization are generally one- or two-package coatings that polymerize by way of a chemical reaction, and cure into a crosslinked film. Depending on composition they may need to dry first, by evaporation of solvent. Classic two-package [[epoxy|epoxies]] or [[polyurethane]]s would fall into this category.<ref name=\"Ber114\">Berendsen, A. M., & Berendsen, A. M. (1989). ''Marine painting manual''. London: Graham & Trotman. {{ISBN|1-85333-286-0}} p. 114.</ref>\n\nThe \"drying oils\", counter-intuitively, actually cure by a crosslinking reaction even if they are not put through an oven cycle and seem to simply dry in air. The film formation mechanism of the simplest examples involve first evaporation of solvents followed by reaction with oxygen from the environment over a period of days, weeks and even months to create a crosslinked network.<ref name=\"Wicks_5\"/> Classic [[alkyd]] enamels would fall into this category. Oxidative cure coatings are catalyzed by metal complex driers such as [[cobalt naphthenate]].\n\nRecent environmental requirements restrict the use of [[volatile organic compound]]s (VOCs), and alternative means of curing have been developed, generally for industrial purposes. [[UV curing]] paints, for example, enable formulation with very low amounts of solvent, or even none at all. This can be achieved because of the monomers and oligomers used in the coating have relatively very low molecular weight, and are therefore low enough in viscosity to enable good fluid flow without the need for additional thinner. If solvent is present in significant amounts, generally it is mostly evaporated first and then crosslinking is initiated by ultraviolet light. Similarly, [[powder coating]]s contain little or no solvent. Flow and cure are produced by heating of the substrate after electrostatic application of the dry powder.<ref>http://news.thomasnet.com/fullstory/acrylic-binder-improves-hardness-in-low-voc-architectural-paints-2005047</ref>\n\n'''Combination mechanisms''': So-called \"catalyzed\" lacquers\" or \"crosslinking latex\" coatings are designed to form films by a combination of methods: classic drying plus a curing reaction that benefits from the catalyst. There are paints called plastisols/organosols, which are made by blending PVC granules with a plasticiser. These are stoved and the mix coalesces.\n\n====Diluent or solvent or thinner====\nThe main purposes of the diluent are to dissolve the polymer and adjust the [[viscosity]] of the paint. It is volatile and does not become part of the paint film. It also controls flow and application properties, and in some cases can affect the stability of the paint while in liquid state. Its main function is as the carrier for the non volatile components. To spread heavier oils (for example, linseed) as in oil-based interior house paint, a thinner oil is required. These volatile substances impart their properties temporarily\u2014once the solvent has evaporated, the remaining paint is fixed to the surface.\n\nThis component is optional: some paints have no [[diluent]].\n\nWater is the main diluent for water-borne paints, even the co-solvent types.\n\nSolvent-borne, also called oil-based, paints can have various combinations of organic solvents as the diluent, including [[Aliphatic compound|aliphatics]], [[Aromaticity|aromatics]], [[alcohol]]s, [[ketone]]s and [[white spirit]]. Specific examples are organic solvents such as [[turpentine substitute|petroleum distillate]], [[ester]]s, [[glycol]] ethers, and the like. Sometimes volatile low-molecular weight synthetic resins also serve as diluents.\n\n===Pigment, dye and filler===\n{{main|Pigment}}\nPigments are granular solids incorporated in the paint to contribute color. Dyes are colorants that dissolve in the paint. Fillers are granular solids incorporated to impart toughness, texture, give the paint special properties,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KfggDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA59&dq=Pigments+are+granular+solids+incorporated+in+the+paint+to+contribute+color#v=onepage&q=Pigments%20are%20granular%20solids%20incorporated%20in%20the%20paint%20to%20contribute%20color&f=false|title=Dyes and Pigments|last=G\u00fcrses|first=Ahmet|last2=A\u00e7\u0131ky\u0131ld\u0131z|first2=Metin|last3=G\u00fcne\u015f|first3=K\u00fcbra|last4=G\u00fcrses|first4=M.

During production, the size of such particles can be measured with a [[Hegman gauge]]. Rather than using only solid particles, some paints contain [[dye]]s instead of or in combination with pigments.\n\nPigments can be classified as either natural or synthetic. Natural pigments include various [[clay]]s, [[calcium carbonate]], [[mica]], [[silica]]s, and [[talc]]s. Synthetics would include engineered molecules, [[calcining|calcined]] clays, [[blanc fixe]], precipitated calcium carbonate, and synthetic pyrogenic silicas.\n\nHiding pigments, in making paint opaque, also protect the substrate from the harmful effects of [[ultraviolet light]]. Hiding pigments include [[titanium dioxide]], [[Phthalocyanine Blue BN|phthalo blue]], [[red iron oxide]], and many others.\n\nFillers are a special type of pigment that serve to thicken the film, support its structure and increase the volume of the paint. Fillers are usually cheap and inert materials, such as [[diatomaceous earth]], [[talc]], [[lime (mineral)|lime]], [[barytes]], clay, etc. Floor paints that must resist abrasion may contain fine quartz sand as a filler. Not all paints include fillers. On the other hand, some paints contain large proportions of pigment/filler and binder.\n\nSome pigments are toxic, such as the [[lead]] pigments that are used in [[lead paint]]. Paint manufacturers began replacing white lead pigments with  titanium white (titanium dioxide), before lead was banned in paint for residential use in 1978 by the US Consumer Product Safety Commission. The titanium dioxide used in most paints today is often coated with silica/alumina/zirconium for various reasons, such as better exterior durability, or better hiding performance (opacity) promoted by more optimal spacing within the paint film.<ref>http://articles.latimes.com/2011/oct/14/science/la-sci-ancient-paint-20111014</ref>\n\nMicaceous [[Iron(III) oxide|iron oxide]] (MIO) is another alternative to lead for protection of steel, giving more protection against water and light damage than most paints. When MIO pigments are ground into fine particles, most cleave into shiny layers, which reflect light, thus minimising [[UV degradation]] and protecting the [[resin]] binder. Most pigments used in paint tend to be spherical, but lamellar pigments, such as glass flake and MIO have overlapping plates, which impede the path of water molecules.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.duluxprotectivecoatings.com.au/technotespdf/5.2.1%20MIO%20Coatings%20-%20What%20Are%20They.pdf|title=MIO Coatings \u2013 What Are They?|last=|first=|date=2009|website=Dulux Protective Coatings|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> For optimum performance MIO should have a high content of thin flake-like particles resembling [[mica]].

Some examples include additives to modify [[surface tension]], improve flow properties, improve the finished appearance, increase wet edge, improve pigment stability, impart [[antifreeze]] properties, control foaming, control skinning, etc. Other types of additives include [[catalyst]]s, thickeners, stabilizers, [[emulsifier]]s, texturizers, adhesion promoters, UV stabilizers, flatteners (de-glossing agents), biocides to fight [[bacteria]]l growth and the like.\n\nAdditives normally do not significantly alter the percentages of individual components in a formulation.<ref>[http://www.frpdesigns.com/formulation%20calculations.htm frpdesigns.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211213714/http://www.frpdesigns.com/formulation%20calculations.htm |date=2010-02-11 }}, \"Formulations, Fundamentals, Manipulation, Calculation and Data Management\" p. 61.</ref>\n\n==Color-changingThermochromic paints and coatings contain materials that change conformation when heat is applied or removed, and so they change color. [[Liquid crystal]]s have been used in such paints, such as in the thermometer strips and tapes used in aquaria and novelty/promotional thermal cups and straws. \n\nPhotochromic materials are used to make eyeglasses and other products. Similar to thermochromic molecules, photochromic molecules change conformation when light energy is applied or removed, and so they change color.\n\nColor-changing paints can also be made by adding halochrome compounds or other organic pigments. One patent<ref>{{cite web|last=Bramley|first=Christopher Sinjin|title=Colour changing paint|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/EP1400574A1.pdf|work=European Patent Application EP1400574|publisher=European Patent Office}}</ref>  cites use of these indicators for wall coating applications for light colored paints. When the paint is wet it is pink in color but upon drying it regains its original white color. As cited in patent, this property of the paint enabled two or more coats to be applied on a wall properly and evenly. The previous coats having dried would be white whereas the new wet coat would be distinctly pink. Ashland Inc. introduced foundry refractory coatings with similar principle in 2005<ref>{{cite news|title=Dramatic color change featured|url=http://www.newmaterials.com/Customisation/News/General/General/Dramatic_color_change_featured_in_Ashlands_VELVAPLAST_ZW_FDI_refractory.asp|newspaper=New Materials International}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Horvath|first=Lee|title=Coatings Go Beyond Appearance to Provide Quality Control|url=http://www.foundrymag.com/feature/feature/77970/|work=Foundry Technology|publisher=Foundry Management & Technology}}</ref> for use in foundries.\n\nElectrochromic paints change color in response to an applied electric current. Car manufacturer [[Nissan]] has been reportedly working on an electrochromic paint, based on particles of [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] [[iron oxide]]. When subjected to an electromagnetic field the paramagnetic particles change spacing, modifying their color and reflective properties. The electromagnetic field would be formed using the conductive metal of the car body.<ref>[http://www.dailytech.com/Nissan+Develops+Color+Changing+Paint+for+Vehicles/article9611.htm DailyTech - Nissan Develops Color Changing Paint for Vehicles<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Electrochromic paints can be applied to plastic substrates as well, using a different coating chemistry. The technology involves using special dyes that change conformation when an electric current is applied across the film itself. This new technology has been used to achieve glare protection at the touch of a button in passenger airplane windows.\n\nColor can also change depending on viewing angle, using [[iridescence]], for example, in [[ChromaFlair]].\n\n==Art==\n{{main|Painting}}\n\n[[File:Brush and watercolours.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Watercolor]]s as applied with a [[brush]]]]\nSince the time of the [[Renaissance]], [[siccative]] [[drying oil|(drying) oil]] paints, primarily [[linseed oil]], have been the most commonly used kind of paints in fine art applications; [[oil paint]] is still common today. However, in the 20th century, water-based paints, including [[watercolor]]s and [[acrylic paint]]s, became very popular with the development of [[Acryl group|acrylic]] and other latex paints. [[Milk paint]]s (also called [[casein]]), where the medium is derived from the natural emulsion that is [[milk]], were popular in the 19th century and are still available today. [[Egg tempera]] (where the medium is an [[emulsion]] of raw [[egg yolk]] mixed with oil) is still in use as well, as are encaustic [[wax]]-based paints. [[Gouache]] is a variety of opaque watercolor that was also used in the [[Middle Ages]] and Renaissance for manuscript illuminations. The pigment was often made from ground semiprecious stones such as [[lapis lazuli]] and the binder made from either [[gum arabic]] or [[egg white]]. Gouache, also known as 'designer color' or 'body color' is commercially available today.\n\n[[Poster paint]] has been used primarily in the creation of student works, or by children.\n[[File:Unio pictorum.jpg|thumb|left|100px|The \"[[painter's mussel]]\", a European freshwater mussel. Individual shell valves were used by artists as a small dish for paint.]]\n\n==Application==\nPaint can be applied as a solid, a gaseous suspension ([[aerosol]]) or a liquid. Techniques vary depending on the practical or artistic results desired.\n\nAs a '''solid''' (usually used in industrial and automotive applications), the paint is applied as a very fine powder, then baked at high temperature. This melts the powder and causes it to adhere to the surface. The reasons for doing this involve the chemistries of the paint, the surface itself, and perhaps even the chemistry of the substrate (the object being painted). This is called \"[[powder coating]]\" an object.\n\nAs a '''gas''' or as a gaseous suspension, the paint is suspended in solid or liquid form in a gas that is [[spray painting|sprayed on]] an object. The paint sticks to the object. This is called \"spray painting\" an object. The reasons for doing this include:\n\n* The application mechanism is air and thus no solid object touches the object being painted;\n* The distribution of the paint is uniform, so there are no sharp lines;\n* It is possible to deliver very small amounts of paint;\n* A chemical (typically a [[solvent]]) can be sprayed along with the paint to dissolve together both the delivered paint and the chemicals on the surface of the object being painted;\n* Some chemical reactions in paint involve the orientation of the paint [[molecules]].\n\nIn the '''liquid''' application, paint can be applied by direct application using [[brush]]es, [[paint rollers]], [[Palette knife|blades]], scrapers, other instruments, or body parts such as fingers and thumbs.\n\nRollers generally have a handle that allows for different lengths of poles to be attached, allowing painting at different heights. Generally, roller application requires two coats for even color. A roller with a thicker [[nap (textile)|nap]] is used to apply paint on uneven surfaces. Edges are often finished with an angled brush.\n\n*Using the finish flat one would most likely use a 1/2\" nap roller\n*Using the finish eggshell one would most likely use a 3/8\" nap roller\n*Using the finish satin or pearl one would most likely use a 3/8\" nap roller\n*Using the finish semi-gloss or gloss one would most likely use a 3/16\" nap roller\n<ref>\"Selecting the Right Paint Roller.\" Selecting the Right Paint Roller.

The open time of an oil or alkyd-based emulsion paint can be extended by adding [[white spirit]], similar glycols such as Dowanol (propylene glycol ether) or open time prolongers. This can also facilitate the mixing of different wet paint layers for aesthetic effect. Latex and acrylic emulsions require the use of drying retardants suitable for water-based coatings.\n\nPaint application by spray is the most popular method in industry. In this, paint is aerosolized by the force of compressed air or by the action of high pressure compression of the paint itself, and the paint is turned into small droplets that travel to the article to be painted. Alternate methods are airless spray, hot spray, hot airless spray, and any of these with an electrostatic spray included. There are numerous electrostatic methods available.\n\nDipping used to be the norm for objects such as filing cabinets, but this has been replaced by high speed air turbine driven bells with electrostatic spray. Car bodies are primed using cathodic elephoretic primer, which is applied by charging the body depositing a layer of primer. The unchanged residue is rinsed off and the primer stoved.\n\nMany paints tend to separate when stored, the heavier components settling to the bottom, and require mixing before use. Some paint outlets have machines for mixing the paint by shaking the can vigorously for a few minutes.\n\nThe opacity and the film thickness of paint may be measured using a [[drawdown card]].\n\nWater-based paints tend to be the easiest to clean up after use; the brushes and rollers can be cleaned with soap and water.\n\nProper disposal of left over paint is a challenge. Sometimes it can be recycled: Old paint may be usable for a primer coat or an intermediate coat, and paints of similar chemistry can be mixed to make a larger amount of a uniform color.\n\nTo dispose of paint it can be dried and disposed of in the domestic waste stream, provided that it contains no prohibited substances (see container). Disposal of liquid paint usually requires special handling and should be treated as hazardous waste, and disposed of according to local regulations.<ref>[http://muextension.missouri.edu/xplor/wasteman/wm6001.htm \"Safe Use, Storage and Disposal of Paint\"]</ref><ref>[http://www.epa.state.oh.us/pic/facts/hhwpaint.html \"Storage and Disposal of Paint Facts\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118110649/http://www.epa.state.oh.us/pic/facts/hhwpaint.html |date=2007-11-18 }}</ref>\n\n==Product variants==\n[[File:EWM paint 2007.jpg|thumb|A collection of cans of paint and variants]]\n[[Image:Vlg shop.jpg|thumb|A huge collection of different kinds of spray cans, markers, paints and inks in the underground graffiti shop. [[Russia]], [[Tver|Tver City]], 2011.]]\n[[File:Kwadi.jpg|thumb|Blue colour paint smears]]\n\n*'''[[Primer (paint)|Primer]]''' is a preparatory coating put on materials before applying the paint itself. The primed surface ensures better [[adhesion]] of the paint, thereby increasing the durability of the paint and providing improved protection for the painted surface. Suitable primers also may block and seal stains, or hide a color that is to be painted over.\n*'''[[Emulsion]] paints''' are water-based paints in which the paint material is dispersed in a liquid that consists mainly of water. For suitable purposes this has advantages in fast drying, low toxicity, low cost, easier application, and easier cleaning of equipment, among other factors. \n*'''[[Varnish]]''' and '''[[shellac]]''' are in effect paints without pigment; they provide a protective coating without substantially changing the color of the surface, though they can emphasise the colour of the material. \n*'''[[Wood stain]]''' is a type of paint that is formulated to be very \"thin\", meaning low in viscosity, so that the pigment soaks into a material such as wood rather than remaining in a film on the surface. Stain is mainly dispersed [[pigment]] or dissolved [[dye]] plus binder material in solvent. It is designed to add color without providing a surface coating.\n*'''[[Lacquer]]''' is a solvent-based paint or varnish that produces an especially hard, durable finish. Usually it is a rapidly drying formulation.\n*'''[[Enamel paint]]''' is formulated to give an especially hard, usually glossy, finish. Some enamel paints contain fine glass powder or metal flake instead of the color pigments in standard oil-based paints. Enamel paint sometimes is mixed with varnish or urethane to improve its shine and hardness.\n*'''A [[glaze (painting technique)|glaze]]''' is an additive used with paint to slow drying time and increase translucency, as in [[faux painting]] and for some artistic effects.\n*'''A [[roof coating]]''' is a fluid that sets as an elastic membrane that can stretch without harm. It provides UV protection to polyurethane foam and is widely used in roof restoration.\n*'''[[Fingerpaint]]s''' are formulations suitable for application with the fingers; they are popular for use by children in primary school activities.\n*'''[[Ink]]s''' are similar to paints, except that they are typically made using finely ground pigments or dyes, and are not designed to leave a thick film of binder. They are used largely for writing, printing, or [[calligraphy]].\n*'''[[Anti-graffiti coating]]s''' are used to defeat the marking of surfaces by [[graffiti]] artists or vandals. There are two categories of anti-graffiti coatings: sacrificial and non-bonding: \n:*'''Sacrificial coatings''' are clear coatings that allow the removal of graffiti, usually by washing the surface with high-pressure water that removes the graffiti together with the coating (hence the term \"sacrificial\"). After removal of the graffiti, the sacrificial coating must be re-applied for continued protection. Such sacrificial protective coatings are most commonly used on natural-looking masonry surfaces, such as statuary and marble walls, and on rougher surfaces that are difficult to clean. \n:*'''Non-bonding coatings''' are clear, high-performance coatings, usually catalyzed [[polyurethanes]], that do not bond strongly to paints used for graffiti. Graffiti on such a surface can be removed with a solvent wash, without damaging either the underlying surface or the protective non-bonding coating. These coatings work best on smooth surfaces, and are especially useful on decorative surfaces such as mosaics or painted murals, which might be expected to suffer harm from high pressure sprays.\n*'''Urine-repellent paint''' is a very [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] (water-repellent) paint.  It has been used by cities and other property owners to deter men from [[Public urination|urinating against walls]], as the urine splashes back on their shoes, instead of dripping down the wall.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Huggler|first=Justin|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/11449700/Hamburg-fights-back-against-urination-on-streets-with-walls-that-pee-back.html|title=Hamburg fights back against urination on streets with walls that 'pee back'|date=2015-03-04|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2020-04-02|url-status=live|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/SF-s-new-pee-resistant-walls-seem-to-be-keeping-6417888.php|title=S.F.\u2019s new urine-resistant walls seem to be keeping things dry|last=Johnson|first=Lizzie|date=2015-07-31|website=SFGate|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-35120259|title='Anti-pee' walls will splash offenders|date=2015-12-17|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-04-02|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n*'''[[Anti-climb paint]]''' is a non-drying paint that appears normal but is extremely slippery. It is useful on drainpipes and ledges to deter burglars and vandals from climbing them, and is found in many public places. When a person attempts to climb objects coated with the paint, it rubs off onto the climber, as well as making it hard for them to climb.\n*'''[[Anti-fouling paint]]''', or bottom paint, prevents barnacles and other marine organisms from adhering to the [[hull (watercraft)|hulls]] of ships.\n*'''[[Insulative paint]]''' or '''insulating paint''', reduces the rate of thermal transfer through a surface it's applied to. One type of formulation is based on the addition of hollow [[microspheres]] to any suitable type of paint.\n*'''Anti-slip paint''' contains chemicals or grit to increase the friction of a surface so as to decrease the risk of slipping, particularly in wet conditions.\n*'''Road marking paint'''<ref name=\"road marking paint\">{{cite web|title=road marking paint|url=http://wiki.dyroadmark.com/road-marking-paint.html/}}</ref> is specially used to marking and painting road traffic signs and lines, to form a durable coating film on the road surface. It must be fast drying, provide a thick coating, and resist wear and slipping, especially in wet conditions.\n*'''[[Luminous paint]]''' or luminescent paint is paint that exhibits luminescence. In other words, it gives off visible light through fluorescence, phosphorescence, or radioluminescence.\n\n=== Finish types ===\n\n*'''Flat Finish''' paint is generally used on ceilings or walls that are in bad shape. This finish is useful for hiding imperfections in walls and it is economical in effectively covering relatively great areas. However this finish is not easily washable and is subject to staining.\n*'''Matte Finish''' is generally similar to flat finish, but such paints commonly offer superior washability and coverage. (See [[Gloss and matte paint]].)\n*'''Eggshell Finish''' has some sheen, supposedly like that of the shell on an egg. This finish provides great washability, but is not very effective at hiding imperfections on walls and similar surfaces. Eggshell finish is valued for bathrooms because it is washable and water repellent, so that it tends not to peel in a wet environment.\n*'''Pearl (Satin) Finish''' is very durable in terms of washability and resistance to moisture, even in comparison to eggshell finish. It protects walls from dirt, moisture and stains. Accordingly, it is exceptionally valuable for bathrooms, furniture, and kitchens, but it is shinier than eggshell, so it is even more prone to show imperfections.\n*'''Semi-Gloss Finish''' typically is used on trim to emphasise detail and elegance, and to show off woodwork, such as on doors and furniture. It provides a shiny surface and provides good protection from moisture and stains on walls. Its gloss does however emphasise imperfections on the walls and similar surfaces. It is popular in schools and factories where washability and durability are the main considerations.<ref>\"Paint Finish and Sheen Information; Info on Satin, Eggshell, Matte, and Other Paint Finishes.\" Professional Painting Contractor.

It pairs well with other finishes. While it is highly durable and easy to clean, high gloss paint is known for obvious visibility of imperfections like scratches, dents.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.housebeautiful.com/home-remodeling/interior-designers/g26802172/what-is-high-gloss-paint/|title=Designers Are Going Nuts Over This Super Glossy Paint|last=Mendelsohn|first=Hadley|date=2019-03-13|website=House Beautiful|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-11}}</ref>\n\n==Failure==\nThe main reasons of paint failure after application on surface are the applicator and improper treatment of surface.\n\nDefects or degradation can be attributed to:\n;Dilution\n:This usually occurs when the dilution of the paint is not done as per manufacturers recommendation. There can be a case of over dilution and under dilution, as well as dilution with the incorrect diluent.\n;Contamination\n:Foreign contaminants added without the manufacturers consent can cause various film defects.\n;Peeling/Blistering\n:Most commonly due to improper surface treatment before application and inherent moisture/dampness being present in the substrate. The degree of blistering can be assessed according to ISO 4628 Part 2 or ASTM Method D714 (Standard Test Method for Evaluating Degree of Blistering of Paints). \n;Chalking\n:Chalking is the progressive powdering of the paint film on the painted surface. The primary reason for the problem is [[polymer degradation]] of the paint matrix due to exposure of [[UV radiation]] in [[sunshine]] and condensation from dew. The degree of chalking varies as epoxies  react quickly while acrylics and polyurethanes can remain unchanged for long periods.<ref>{{cite book|last= Bayliss |first= D.A. |title= Steelwork corrosion control |year= 2002 |publisher= Spon |location= London |isbn= 978-0-415-26101-2 |pages= 13.6.6 Chalking |edition= 2nd |author2=Deacon, D.H.}}</ref> The degree of chalking can be assessed according to [[International Organization for Standardization|International Standard]] ISO 4628 Part 6 or 7 or [[American Society of Testing and Materials]](ASTM) Method D4214 (Standard Test Methods for Evaluating the Degree of Chalking of Exterior Paint Films).\n;Cracking\n:Cracking of paint film is due to the unequal expansion or contraction of paint coats. It usually happens when the coats of the paint are not allowed to cure/dry completely before the next coat is applied. The degree of cracking can be assessed according to International Standard ISO 4628 Part 4 or ASTM Method D661 (Standard Test Method for Evaluating Degree of Cracking of Exterior Paints).\n;Erosion\n:Erosion is very quick chalking. It occurs due to external agents like air, water etc. It can be evaluated using ASTM Method ASTM D662 (Standard Test Method for Evaluating Degree of Erosion of Exterior Paints). The generation of acid by fungal species can be a significant component of erosion of painted surfaces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icas.org/ICAS_ARCHIVE/ICAS2006/PAPERS/013.PDF|title=Measures and Test Techniques for Fungus Resistance to Aircraft Materials and Equipment |author1= Xiaohui Wang|author2= Ling Wang|date=2006}}</ref> The fungus&nbsp;''[[Aureobasidium pullulans]]''&nbsp;is known for damaging wall paints.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.hawaii.edu/~johnb/micro/m140/syllabus/week/eucaryotes/fungi/ascomycota.html|title=Ascomycota|author1= John W.

It is most commonly used to protect, color, or provide texture to objects. Paint can be made or purchased in many colors\u2014and in many different types, such as watercolor or synthetic. Paint is typically stored, sold, and applied as a liquid, but most types dry into a solid. Most paints are either oil-based or water-based and each have distinct characteristics. For one, it is illegal in most municipalities to discard oil based paint down household drains or sewers. Solvents for clean up are also different for water based paint than they are for oil based paint.<ref>https://www.hgtv.com/design/decorating/design-101/painting-101-oil-or-latex</ref> Water-based paints and oil-based paints will cure differently based on the outside ambient temperature of the object being painted (such as a house.) Usually the object being painted must be over {{convert|10|C|F}}, although some manufacturers of external paints/primers claim they can be applied when temperatures are as low as {{convert|35|F|C|order=flip}}.<ref>https://www.consumerreports.org/painting/ideal-outdoor-temperature-range-exterior-paint/</ref> \n \n==History==\n[[File:Lascaux, Megaloceros.jpg|thumb|right|A charcoal and ochre cave painting of [[Megaloceros]] from [[Lascaux]], France]]\nPaint was one of the earliest inventions of mankind.

The Egyptians mixed their colors with a gummy substance and applied them separately from each other without any blending or mixture. They appear to have used six colors: white, black, blue, red, yellow, and green. They first covered the area entirely with white, then traced the design in black, leaving out the lights of the ground color. They used [[lead tetroxide|minium]] for red, generally of a dark tinge.\n\n[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] mentions some painted ceilings in his day in the town of [[Ardea (RM)|Ardea]], which had been made prior to the foundation of [[Rome]]. He expressed great surprise and admiration at their freshness, after the lapse of so many centuries.\n\nPaint was made with the yolk of [[Egg (food)|eggs]] and therefore, the substance would harden and adhere to the surface it was applied to. Pigment was made from plants, sand, and different soils. Most paints used either oil or water as a [[Binder (material)|base]] (the diluent, solvent or vehicle for the pigment).\n\nA still extant example of 17th-century house oil painting is [[Ham House]] in [[Surrey]], [[England]], where a primer was used along with several undercoats and an elaborate decorative overcoat; the pigment and oil mixture would have been ground into a paste with a mortar and pestle. The process was done by hand by the painters, which exposed them to lead poisoning, due to the white-lead powder.\n\nIn 1718, Marshall Smith invented a \"Machine or Engine for the Grinding of Colours\" in England. It is not known precisely how it operated, but it was a device that increased the efficiency of pigment grinding dramatically. Soon, a company called Emerton and Manby was advertising exceptionally low-priced paints that had been ground with labour-saving technology:\n:''One Pound of Colour ground in a Horse-Mill will paint twelve Yards of Work, whereas Colour ground any other Way, will not do half that Quantity.''\nBy the proper onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]], in the mid-18th century, paint was being ground in steam-powered mills, and an alternative to lead-based pigments had been found in a white derivative of zinc oxide. Interior house painting increasingly became the norm as the 19th century progressed, both for decorative reasons and because the paint was effective in preventing the walls rotting from damp. Linseed oil was also increasingly used as an inexpensive binder.\n\nIn 1866, [[Sherwin-Williams]] in the [[United States]] opened as a large paint-maker and invented a paint that could be used from the tin without preparation.\n\nIt was not until the stimulus of [[World War II]] created a shortage of linseed oil in the supply market that artificial resins, or alkyds, were invented. Cheap and easy to make, they also held the color well and lasted for a long time.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/pages/arts/design/index.html ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref>{{failed verification|date=December 2015}}{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n==Components==\n\n===Vehicle===\nThe vehicle is composed of the binder; or, if it is necessary to thin the binder with a diluent like solvent or water, it is the combination of binder and diluent.<ref name=\"Wicks_5\">{{cite book|last1=Wicks|first1=Zeno W., Jr.|last2=Jones|first2=Frank N.|last3=Pappas|first3=S.

Thus, an important quantity in coatings formulation is the \"vehicle solids\", sometimes called the \"resin solids\" of the formula. This is the proportion of the wet coating weight that is binder, i.e. the polymer backbone of the film that will remain after drying or curing is complete.\n\n====Binder or film former====\nThe binder is the film-forming component of paint.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Vermeer's Palette: The Anatomy of Pigment and Binder|url = http://www.essentialvermeer.com/palette/palette_anatomy_of_paint.html#.VieiDCvQO6I|website = www.essentialvermeer.com|accessdate = 2015-10-21}}</ref> It is the only component that is always present among all the various types of formulations. Many binders are too thick to be applied and must be thinned. The type of thinner, if present, varies with the binder.\n\nThe binder imparts properties such as gloss, durability, flexibility, and toughness.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sGQdBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA101&dq=The+binder+gives+properties+such+as+gloss,+durability,+flexibility,+and+toughness.#v=onepage&q=The%20binder%20gives%20properties%20such%20as%20gloss,%20durability,%20flexibility,%20and%20toughness.&f=false|title=CourseSmart International E-Book for Environmental Chemistry|last=Baird|first=Colin|last2=Cann|first2=Michael|date=2012-06-30|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9781464162879|language=en}}</ref>\n\nBinders include synthetic or natural resins such as [[alkyd]]s, [[acrylic resin|acrylic]]s, vinyl-acrylics, vinyl acetate/ethylene (VAE), [[polyurethane]]s, [[polyester]]s, [[melamine resin]]s, [[epoxy]], silanes or siloxanes or [[Oil paint|oil]]s.\n\nBinders can be categorized according to the mechanisms for film formation. Thermoplastic mechanisms include drying and coalescence. Drying refers to simple evaporation of the solvent or thinner to leave a coherent film behind. Coalescence refers to a mechanism that involves drying followed by actual interpenetration and fusion of formerly discrete particles. Thermoplastic film-forming mechanisms are sometimes described as \"thermoplastic cure\" but that is a misnomer because no chemical curing reactions are required to knit the film. Thermosetting mechanisms, on the other hand, are true curing mechanism that involve chemical reaction(s) among the polymers that make up the binder.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Baghdachi|first1=J.|title=Polymer Systems and Film Formation Mechanisms in HIgh Solids, Powder and UV Cure Systems.|url=http://www.swst.org/meetings/AM04/Baghdachi.pdf|website=Society of Wood Science and Technology|publisher=Society of Wood Science and Technology|accessdate=2016-01-13}}</ref>\n\n'''Thermoplastic mechanisms''': Some films are formed by simple cooling of the binder. For example, [[Encaustic painting|encaustic]] or [[wax]] paints are liquid when warm, and harden upon cooling. In many cases, they resoften or liquify if reheated.\n\nPaints that dry by solvent evaporation and contain the solid binder dissolved in a solvent are known as lacquers. A solid film forms when the solvent evaporates. Because no chemical crosslinking is involved, the film can re-dissolve in solvent; as such, lacquers are unsuitable for applications where chemical resistance is important. Classic [[nitrocellulose]] lacquers fall into this category, as do non-grain raising stains composed of [[dyes]] dissolved in solvent. Performance varies by formulation, but lacquers generally tend to have better [[UV coating|UV resistance]] and lower corrosion resistance than comparable systems that cure by polymerization or coalescence.\n\nThe paint type known as [[Emulsion]] in the UK and [[Latex]] in the United States is a water-borne dispersion of sub-micrometer polymer particles. These terms in their respective countries cover all paints that use synthetic polymers such as acrylic, vinyl acrylic ([[Polyvinyl acetate|PVA]]), styrene acrylic, etc. as binders.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dundean.com/tips_what_is_latex_paint.shtml |title=Water-based Alchemy |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}</ref> The term \"latex\" in the context of paint in the United States simply means an aqueous dispersion; [[latex]] rubber from the rubber tree is not an ingredient. These dispersions are prepared by [[emulsion polymerization]]. Such paints cure by a process called coalescence where first the water, and then the trace, or coalescing, solvent, evaporate and draw together and soften the  binder particles and fuse them together into irreversibly bound networked structures, so that the paint cannot redissolve in the solvent/water that originally carried it. The residual [[surfactants in paint]], as well as [[Hydrolysis|hydrolytic]] effects with some polymers cause the paint to remain susceptible to softening and, over time, degradation by water. The general term of latex paint is usually used in the United States, while the term emulsion paint is used for the same products in the UK and the term latex paint is not used at all.\n\n'''Thermosetting mechanisms''': Paints that cure by polymerization are generally one- or two-package coatings that polymerize by way of a chemical reaction, and cure into a crosslinked film. Depending on composition they may need to dry first, by evaporation of solvent. Classic two-package [[epoxy|epoxies]] or [[polyurethane]]s would fall into this category.<ref name=\"Ber114\">Berendsen, A. M., & Berendsen, A. M. (1989). ''Marine painting manual''. London: Graham & Trotman. {{ISBN|1-85333-286-0}} p. 114.</ref>\n\nThe \"drying oils\", counter-intuitively, actually cure by a crosslinking reaction even if they are not put through an oven cycle and seem to simply dry in air. The film formation mechanism of the simplest examples involve first evaporation of solvents followed by reaction with oxygen from the environment over a period of days, weeks and even months to create a crosslinked network.<ref name=\"Wicks_5\"/> Classic [[alkyd]] enamels would fall into this category. Oxidative cure coatings are catalyzed by metal complex driers such as [[cobalt naphthenate]].\n\nRecent environmental requirements restrict the use of [[volatile organic compound]]s (VOCs), and alternative means of curing have been developed, generally for industrial purposes. [[UV curing]] paints, for example, enable formulation with very low amounts of solvent, or even none at all. This can be achieved because of the monomers and oligomers used in the coating have relatively very low molecular weight, and are therefore low enough in viscosity to enable good fluid flow without the need for additional thinner. If solvent is present in significant amounts, generally it is mostly evaporated first and then crosslinking is initiated by ultraviolet light. Similarly, [[powder coating]]s contain little or no solvent. Flow and cure are produced by heating of the substrate after electrostatic application of the dry powder.<ref>http://news.thomasnet.com/fullstory/acrylic-binder-improves-hardness-in-low-voc-architectural-paints-2005047</ref>\n\n'''Combination mechanisms''': So-called \"catalyzed\" lacquers\" or \"crosslinking latex\" coatings are designed to form films by a combination of methods: classic drying plus a curing reaction that benefits from the catalyst. There are paints called plastisols/organosols, which are made by blending PVC granules with a plasticiser. These are stoved and the mix coalesces.\n\n====Diluent or solvent or thinner====\nThe main purposes of the diluent are to dissolve the polymer and adjust the [[viscosity]] of the paint. It is volatile and does not become part of the paint film. It also controls flow and application properties, and in some cases can affect the stability of the paint while in liquid state. Its main function is as the carrier for the non volatile components. To spread heavier oils (for example, linseed) as in oil-based interior house paint, a thinner oil is required. These volatile substances impart their properties temporarily\u2014once the solvent has evaporated, the remaining paint is fixed to the surface.\n\nThis component is optional: some paints have no [[diluent]].\n\nWater is the main diluent for water-borne paints, even the co-solvent types.\n\nSolvent-borne, also called oil-based, paints can have various combinations of organic solvents as the diluent, including [[Aliphatic compound|aliphatics]], [[Aromaticity|aromatics]], [[alcohol]]s, [[ketone]]s and [[white spirit]]. Specific examples are organic solvents such as [[turpentine substitute|petroleum distillate]], [[ester]]s, [[glycol]] ethers, and the like. Sometimes volatile low-molecular weight synthetic resins also serve as diluents.\n\n===Pigment, dye and filler===\n{{main|Pigment}}\nPigments are granular solids incorporated in the paint to contribute color. Dyes are colorants that dissolve in the paint. Fillers are granular solids incorporated to impart toughness, texture, give the paint special properties,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KfggDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA59&dq=Pigments+are+granular+solids+incorporated+in+the+paint+to+contribute+color#v=onepage&q=Pigments%20are%20granular%20solids%20incorporated%20in%20the%20paint%20to%20contribute%20color&f=false|title=Dyes and Pigments|last=G\u00fcrses|first=Ahmet|last2=A\u00e7\u0131ky\u0131ld\u0131z|first2=Metin|last3=G\u00fcne\u015f|first3=K\u00fcbra|last4=G\u00fcrses|first4=M. Sadi|date=2016-05-04|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319338927|language=en}}</ref> or to reduce the cost of the paint. During production, the size of such particles can be measured with a [[Hegman gauge]]. Rather than using only solid particles, some paints contain [[dye]]s instead of or in combination with pigments.\n\nPigments can be classified as either natural or synthetic. Natural pigments include various [[clay]]s, [[calcium carbonate]], [[mica]], [[silica]]s, and [[talc]]s. Synthetics would include engineered molecules, [[calcining|calcined]] clays, [[blanc fixe]], precipitated calcium carbonate, and synthetic pyrogenic silicas.\n\nHiding pigments, in making paint opaque, also protect the substrate from the harmful effects of [[ultraviolet light]]. Hiding pigments include [[titanium dioxide]], [[Phthalocyanine Blue BN|phthalo blue]], [[red iron oxide]], and many others.\n\nFillers are a special type of pigment that serve to thicken the film, support its structure and increase the volume of the paint. Fillers are usually cheap and inert materials, such as [[diatomaceous earth]], [[talc]], [[lime (mineral)|lime]], [[barytes]], clay, etc. Floor paints that must resist abrasion may contain fine quartz sand as a filler. Not all paints include fillers. On the other hand, some paints contain large proportions of pigment/filler and binder.\n\nSome pigments are toxic, such as the [[lead]] pigments that are used in [[lead paint]]. Paint manufacturers began replacing white lead pigments with  titanium white (titanium dioxide), before lead was banned in paint for residential use in 1978 by the US Consumer Product Safety Commission. The titanium dioxide used in most paints today is often coated with silica/alumina/zirconium for various reasons, such as better exterior durability, or better hiding performance (opacity) promoted by more optimal spacing within the paint film.<ref>http://articles.latimes.com/2011/oct/14/science/la-sci-ancient-paint-20111014</ref>\n\nMicaceous [[Iron(III) oxide|iron oxide]] (MIO) is another alternative to lead for protection of steel, giving more protection against water and light damage than most paints. When MIO pigments are ground into fine particles, most cleave into shiny layers, which reflect light, thus minimising [[UV degradation]] and protecting the [[resin]] binder. Most pigments used in paint tend to be spherical, but lamellar pigments, such as glass flake and MIO have overlapping plates, which impede the path of water molecules.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.duluxprotectivecoatings.com.au/technotespdf/5.2.1%20MIO%20Coatings%20-%20What%20Are%20They.pdf|title=MIO Coatings \u2013 What Are They?|last=|first=|date=2009|website=Dulux Protective Coatings|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> For optimum performance MIO should have a high content of thin flake-like particles resembling [[mica]]. [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 10601 sets two levels of MIO content.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:38753:en|title=ISO 10601:2007|last=|first=|date=|website=Micaceous iron oxide pigments|publisher=International Organization for Standardization|access-date=}}</ref> MIO is often derived from a form of [[hematite]].\n\n===Additives===\nBesides the three main categories of ingredients, paint can have a wide variety of miscellaneous additives, which are usually added in small amounts, yet provide a significant effect on the product. Some examples include additives to modify [[surface tension]], improve flow properties, improve the finished appearance, increase wet edge, improve pigment stability, impart [[antifreeze]] properties, control foaming, control skinning, etc. Other types of additives include [[catalyst]]s, thickeners, stabilizers, [[emulsifier]]s, texturizers, adhesion promoters, UV stabilizers, flatteners (de-glossing agents), biocides to fight [[bacteria]]l growth and the like.\n\nAdditives normally do not significantly alter the percentages of individual components in a formulation.<ref>[http://www.frpdesigns.com/formulation%20calculations.htm frpdesigns.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211213714/http://www.frpdesigns.com/formulation%20calculations.htm |date=2010-02-11 }}, \"Formulations, Fundamentals, Manipulation, Calculation and Data Management\" p. 61.</ref>\n\n==Color-changing paint==\nVarious technologies exist for making paints that change color. Thermochromic paints and coatings contain materials that change conformation when heat is applied or removed, and so they change color. [[Liquid crystal]]s have been used in such paints, such as in the thermometer strips and tapes used in aquaria and novelty/promotional thermal cups and straws. \n\nPhotochromic materials are used to make eyeglasses and other products. Similar to thermochromic molecules, photochromic molecules change conformation when light energy is applied or removed, and so they change color.\n\nColor-changing paints can also be made by adding halochrome compounds or other organic pigments. One patent<ref>{{cite web|last=Bramley|first=Christopher Sinjin|title=Colour changing paint|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/EP1400574A1.pdf|work=European Patent Application EP1400574|publisher=European Patent Office}}</ref>  cites use of these indicators for wall coating applications for light colored paints. When the paint is wet it is pink in color but upon drying it regains its original white color. As cited in patent, this property of the paint enabled two or more coats to be applied on a wall properly and evenly. The previous coats having dried would be white whereas the new wet coat would be distinctly pink. Ashland Inc. introduced foundry refractory coatings with similar principle in 2005<ref>{{cite news|title=Dramatic color change featured|url=http://www.newmaterials.com/Customisation/News/General/General/Dramatic_color_change_featured_in_Ashlands_VELVAPLAST_ZW_FDI_refractory.asp|newspaper=New Materials International}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Horvath|first=Lee|title=Coatings Go Beyond Appearance to Provide Quality Control|url=http://www.foundrymag.com/feature/feature/77970/|work=Foundry Technology|publisher=Foundry Management & Technology}}</ref> for use in foundries.\n\nElectrochromic paints change color in response to an applied electric current. Car manufacturer [[Nissan]] has been reportedly working on an electrochromic paint, based on particles of [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] [[iron oxide]]. When subjected to an electromagnetic field the paramagnetic particles change spacing, modifying their color and reflective properties. The electromagnetic field would be formed using the conductive metal of the car body.<ref>[http://www.dailytech.com/Nissan+Develops+Color+Changing+Paint+for+Vehicles/article9611.htm DailyTech - Nissan Develops Color Changing Paint for Vehicles<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Electrochromic paints can be applied to plastic substrates as well, using a different coating chemistry. The technology involves using special dyes that change conformation when an electric current is applied across the film itself. This new technology has been used to achieve glare protection at the touch of a button in passenger airplane windows.\n\nColor can also change depending on viewing angle, using [[iridescence]], for example, in [[ChromaFlair]].\n\n==Art==\n{{main|Painting}}\n\n[[File:Brush and watercolours.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Watercolor]]s as applied with a [[brush]]]]\nSince the time of the [[Renaissance]], [[siccative]] [[drying oil|(drying) oil]] paints, primarily [[linseed oil]], have been the most commonly used kind of paints in fine art applications; [[oil paint]] is still common today. However, in the 20th century, water-based paints, including [[watercolor]]s and [[acrylic paint]]s, became very popular with the development of [[Acryl group|acrylic]] and other latex paints. [[Milk paint]]s (also called [[casein]]), where the medium is derived from the natural emulsion that is [[milk]], were popular in the 19th century and are still available today. [[Egg tempera]] (where the medium is an [[emulsion]] of raw [[egg yolk]] mixed with oil) is still in use as well, as are encaustic [[wax]]-based paints. [[Gouache]] is a variety of opaque watercolor that was also used in the [[Middle Ages]] and Renaissance for manuscript illuminations. The pigment was often made from ground semiprecious stones such as [[lapis lazuli]] and the binder made from either [[gum arabic]] or [[egg white]]. Gouache, also known as 'designer color' or 'body color' is commercially available today.\n\n[[Poster paint]] has been used primarily in the creation of student works, or by children.\n[[File:Unio pictorum.jpg|thumb|left|100px|The \"[[painter's mussel]]\", a European freshwater mussel. Individual shell valves were used by artists as a small dish for paint.]]\n\n==Application==\nPaint can be applied as a solid, a gaseous suspension ([[aerosol]]) or a liquid. Techniques vary depending on the practical or artistic results desired.\n\nAs a '''solid''' (usually used in industrial and automotive applications), the paint is applied as a very fine powder, then baked at high temperature. This melts the powder and causes it to adhere to the surface. The reasons for doing this involve the chemistries of the paint, the surface itself, and perhaps even the chemistry of the substrate (the object being painted). This is called \"[[powder coating]]\" an object.\n\nAs a '''gas''' or as a gaseous suspension, the paint is suspended in solid or liquid form in a gas that is [[spray painting|sprayed on]] an object. The paint sticks to the object. This is called \"spray painting\" an object. The reasons for doing this include:\n\n* The application mechanism is air and thus no solid object touches the object being painted;\n* The distribution of the paint is uniform, so there are no sharp lines;\n* It is possible to deliver very small amounts of paint;\n* A chemical (typically a [[solvent]]) can be sprayed along with the paint to dissolve together both the delivered paint and the chemicals on the surface of the object being painted;\n* Some chemical reactions in paint involve the orientation of the paint [[molecules]].\n\nIn the '''liquid''' application, paint can be applied by direct application using [[brush]]es, [[paint rollers]], [[Palette knife|blades]], scrapers, other instruments, or body parts such as fingers and thumbs.\n\nRollers generally have a handle that allows for different lengths of poles to be attached, allowing painting at different heights. Generally, roller application requires two coats for even color. A roller with a thicker [[nap (textile)|nap]] is used to apply paint on uneven surfaces. Edges are often finished with an angled brush.\n\n*Using the finish flat one would most likely use a 1/2\" nap roller\n*Using the finish eggshell one would most likely use a 3/8\" nap roller\n*Using the finish satin or pearl one would most likely use a 3/8\" nap roller\n*Using the finish semi-gloss or gloss one would most likely use a 3/16\" nap roller\n<ref>\"Selecting the Right Paint Roller.\" Selecting the Right Paint Roller.

The open time of an oil or alkyd-based emulsion paint can be extended by adding [[white spirit]], similar glycols such as Dowanol (propylene glycol ether) or open time prolongers. This can also facilitate the mixing of different wet paint layers for aesthetic effect. Latex and acrylic emulsions require the use of drying retardants suitable for water-based coatings.\n\nPaint application by spray is the most popular method in industry. In this, paint is aerosolized by the force of compressed air or by the action of high pressure compression of the paint itself, and the paint is turned into small droplets that travel to the article to be painted. Alternate methods are airless spray, hot spray, hot airless spray, and any of these with an electrostatic spray included. There are numerous electrostatic methods available.\n\nDipping used to be the norm for objects such as filing cabinets, but this has been replaced by high speed air turbine driven bells with electrostatic spray. Car bodies are primed using cathodic elephoretic primer, which is applied by charging the body depositing a layer of primer. The unchanged residue is rinsed off and the primer stoved.\n\nMany paints tend to separate when stored, the heavier components settling to the bottom, and require mixing before use. Some paint outlets have machines for mixing the paint by shaking the can vigorously for a few minutes.\n\nThe opacity and the film thickness of paint may be measured using a [[drawdown card]].\n\nWater-based paints tend to be the easiest to clean up after use; the brushes and rollers can be cleaned with soap and water.\n\nProper disposal of left over paint is a challenge. Sometimes it can be recycled: Old paint may be usable for a primer coat or an intermediate coat, and paints of similar chemistry can be mixed to make a larger amount of a uniform color.\n\nTo dispose of paint it can be dried and disposed of in the domestic waste stream, provided that it contains no prohibited substances (see container). Disposal of liquid paint usually requires special handling and should be treated as hazardous waste, and disposed of according to local regulations.<ref>[http://muextension.missouri.edu/xplor/wasteman/wm6001.htm \"Safe Use, Storage and Disposal of Paint\"]</ref><ref>[http://www.epa.state.oh.us/pic/facts/hhwpaint.html \"Storage and Disposal of Paint Facts\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118110649/http://www.epa.state.oh.us/pic/facts/hhwpaint.html |date=2007-11-18 }}</ref>\n\n==Product variants==\n[[File:EWM paint 2007.jpg|thumb|A collection of cans of paint and variants]]\n[[Image:Vlg shop.jpg|thumb|A huge collection of different kinds of spray cans, markers, paints and inks in the underground graffiti shop. [[Russia]], [[Tver|Tver City]], 2011.]]\n[[File:Kwadi.jpg|thumb|Blue colour paint smears]]\n\n*'''[[Primer (paint)|Primer]]''' is a preparatory coating put on materials before applying the paint itself. The primed surface ensures better [[adhesion]] of the paint, thereby increasing the durability of the paint and providing improved protection for the painted surface. Suitable primers also may block and seal stains, or hide a color that is to be painted over.\n*'''[[Emulsion]] paints''' are water-based paints in which the paint material is dispersed in a liquid that consists mainly of water. For suitable purposes this has advantages in fast drying, low toxicity, low cost, easier application, and easier cleaning of equipment, among other factors. \n*'''[[Varnish]]''' and '''[[shellac]]''' are in effect paints without pigment; they provide a protective coating without substantially changing the color of the surface, though they can emphasise the colour of the material. \n*'''[[Wood stain]]''' is a type of paint that is formulated to be very \"thin\", meaning low in viscosity, so that the pigment soaks into a material such as wood rather than remaining in a film on the surface. Stain is mainly dispersed [[pigment]] or dissolved [[dye]] plus binder material in solvent. It is designed to add color without providing a surface coating.\n*'''[[Lacquer]]''' is a solvent-based paint or varnish that produces an especially hard, durable finish. Usually it is a rapidly drying formulation.\n*'''[[Enamel paint]]''' is formulated to give an especially hard, usually glossy, finish. Some enamel paints contain fine glass powder or metal flake instead of the color pigments in standard oil-based paints. Enamel paint sometimes is mixed with varnish or urethane to improve its shine and hardness.\n*'''A [[glaze (painting technique)|glaze]]''' is an additive used with paint to slow drying time and increase translucency, as in [[faux painting]] and for some artistic effects.\n*'''A [[roof coating]]''' is a fluid that sets as an elastic membrane that can stretch without harm. It provides UV protection to polyurethane foam and is widely used in roof restoration.\n*'''[[Fingerpaint]]s''' are formulations suitable for application with the fingers; they are popular for use by children in primary school activities.\n*'''[[Ink]]s''' are similar to paints, except that they are typically made using finely ground pigments or dyes, and are not designed to leave a thick film of binder. They are used largely for writing, printing, or [[calligraphy]].\n*'''[[Anti-graffiti coating]]s''' are used to defeat the marking of surfaces by [[graffiti]] artists or vandals. There are two categories of anti-graffiti coatings: sacrificial and non-bonding: \n:*'''Sacrificial coatings''' are clear coatings that allow the removal of graffiti, usually by washing the surface with high-pressure water that removes the graffiti together with the coating (hence the term \"sacrificial\"). After removal of the graffiti, the sacrificial coating must be re-applied for continued protection. Such sacrificial protective coatings are most commonly used on natural-looking masonry surfaces, such as statuary and marble walls, and on rougher surfaces that are difficult to clean. \n:*'''Non-bonding coatings''' are clear, high-performance coatings, usually catalyzed [[polyurethanes]], that do not bond strongly to paints used for graffiti. Graffiti on such a surface can be removed with a solvent wash, without damaging either the underlying surface or the protective non-bonding coating. These coatings work best on smooth surfaces, and are especially useful on decorative surfaces such as mosaics or painted murals, which might be expected to suffer harm from high pressure sprays.\n*'''Urine-repellent paint''' is a very [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] (water-repellent) paint.  It has been used by cities and other property owners to deter men from [[Public urination|urinating against walls]], as the urine splashes back on their shoes, instead of dripping down the wall.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Huggler|first=Justin|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/11449700/Hamburg-fights-back-against-urination-on-streets-with-walls-that-pee-back.html|title=Hamburg fights back against urination on streets with walls that 'pee back'|date=2015-03-04|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2020-04-02|url-status=live|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/SF-s-new-pee-resistant-walls-seem-to-be-keeping-6417888.php|title=S.F.\u2019s new urine-resistant walls seem to be keeping things dry|last=Johnson|first=Lizzie|date=2015-07-31|website=SFGate|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-35120259|title='Anti-pee' walls will splash offenders|date=2015-12-17|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-04-02|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n*'''[[Anti-climb paint]]''' is a non-drying paint that appears normal but is extremely slippery. It is useful on drainpipes and ledges to deter burglars and vandals from climbing them, and is found in many public places. When a person attempts to climb objects coated with the paint, it rubs off onto the climber, as well as making it hard for them to climb.\n*'''[[Anti-fouling paint]]''', or bottom paint, prevents barnacles and other marine organisms from adhering to the [[hull (watercraft)|hulls]] of ships.\n*'''[[Insulative paint]]''' or '''insulating paint''', reduces the rate of thermal transfer through a surface it's applied to. One type of formulation is based on the addition of hollow [[microspheres]] to any suitable type of paint.\n*'''Anti-slip paint''' contains chemicals or grit to increase the friction of a surface so as to decrease the risk of slipping, particularly in wet conditions.\n*'''Road marking paint'''<ref name=\"road marking paint\">{{cite web|title=road marking paint|url=http://wiki.dyroadmark.com/road-marking-paint.html/}}</ref> is specially used to marking and painting road traffic signs and lines, to form a durable coating film on the road surface. It must be fast drying, provide a thick coating, and resist wear and slipping, especially in wet conditions.\n*'''[[Luminous paint]]''' or luminescent paint is paint that exhibits luminescence. In other words, it gives off visible light through fluorescence, phosphorescence, or radioluminescence.\n\n=== Finish types ===\n\n*'''Flat Finish''' paint is generally used on ceilings or walls that are in bad shape. This finish is useful for hiding imperfections in walls and it is economical in effectively covering relatively great areas. However this finish is not easily washable and is subject to staining.\n*'''Matte Finish''' is generally similar to flat finish, but such paints commonly offer superior washability and coverage. (See [[Gloss and matte paint]].)\n*'''Eggshell Finish''' has some sheen, supposedly like that of the shell on an egg. This finish provides great washability, but is not very effective at hiding imperfections on walls and similar surfaces. Eggshell finish is valued for bathrooms because it is washable and water repellent, so that it tends not to peel in a wet environment.\n*'''Pearl (Satin) Finish''' is very durable in terms of washability and resistance to moisture, even in comparison to eggshell finish. It protects walls from dirt, moisture and stains. Accordingly, it is exceptionally valuable for bathrooms, furniture, and kitchens, but it is shinier than eggshell, so it is even more prone to show imperfections.\n*'''Semi-Gloss Finish''' typically is used on trim to emphasise detail and elegance, and to show off woodwork, such as on doors and furniture. It provides a shiny surface and provides good protection from moisture and stains on walls. Its gloss does however emphasise imperfections on the walls and similar surfaces. It is popular in schools and factories where washability and durability are the main considerations.<ref>\"Paint Finish and Sheen Information; Info on Satin, Eggshell, Matte, and Other Paint Finishes.\" Professional Painting Contractor. Professional Painters, 2011.

It pairs well with other finishes. While it is highly durable and easy to clean, high gloss paint is known for obvious visibility of imperfections like scratches, dents.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.housebeautiful.com/home-remodeling/interior-designers/g26802172/what-is-high-gloss-paint/|title=Designers Are Going Nuts Over This Super Glossy Paint|last=Mendelsohn|first=Hadley|date=2019-03-13|website=House Beautiful|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-11}}</ref>\n\n==Failure==\nThe main reasons of paint failure after application on surface are the applicator and improper treatment of surface.\n\nDefects or degradation can be attributed to:\n;Dilution\n:This usually occurs when the dilution of the paint is not done as per manufacturers recommendation. There can be a case of over dilution and under dilution, as well as dilution with the incorrect diluent.\n;Contamination\n:Foreign contaminants added without the manufacturers consent can cause various film defects.\n;Peeling/Blistering\n:Most commonly due to improper surface treatment before application and inherent moisture/dampness being present in the substrate. The degree of blistering can be assessed according to ISO 4628 Part 2 or ASTM Method D714 (Standard Test Method for Evaluating Degree of Blistering of Paints). \n;Chalking\n:Chalking is the progressive powdering of the paint film on the painted surface. The primary reason for the problem is [[polymer degradation]] of the paint matrix due to exposure of [[UV radiation]] in [[sunshine]] and condensation from dew. The degree of chalking varies as epoxies  react quickly while acrylics and polyurethanes can remain unchanged for long periods.<ref>{{cite book|last= Bayliss |first= D.A. |title= Steelwork corrosion control |year= 2002 |publisher= Spon |location= London |isbn= 978-0-415-26101-2 |pages= 13.6.6 Chalking |edition= 2nd |author2=Deacon, D.H.}}</ref> The degree of chalking can be assessed according to [[International Organization for Standardization|International Standard]] ISO 4628 Part 6 or 7 or [[American Society of Testing and Materials]](ASTM) Method D4214 (Standard Test Methods for Evaluating the Degree of Chalking of Exterior Paint Films).\n;Cracking\n:Cracking of paint film is due to the unequal expansion or contraction of paint coats. It usually happens when the coats of the paint are not allowed to cure/dry completely before the next coat is applied. The degree of cracking can be assessed according to International Standard ISO 4628 Part 4 or ASTM Method D661 (Standard Test Method for Evaluating Degree of Cracking of Exterior Paints).\n;Erosion\n:Erosion is very quick chalking. It occurs due to external agents like air, water etc. It can be evaluated using ASTM Method ASTM D662 (Standard Test Method for Evaluating Degree of Erosion of Exterior Paints). The generation of acid by fungal species can be a significant component of erosion of painted surfaces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icas.org/ICAS_ARCHIVE/ICAS2006/PAPERS/013.PDF|title=Measures and Test Techniques for Fungus Resistance to Aircraft Materials and Equipment |author1= Xiaohui Wang|author2= Ling Wang|date=2006}}</ref> The fungus&nbsp;''[[Aureobasidium pullulans]]''&nbsp;is known for damaging wall paints.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.hawaii.edu/~johnb/micro/m140/syllabus/week/eucaryotes/fungi/ascomycota.html|title=Ascomycota|author1= John W.

PCB is a global pollutant and was measured in the wastewater effluent from paint production. The widespread distribution of PCB suggests volatilization of this compound from surfaces, roofs etc. PCB is present in consumer goods including newspapers, magazines, and cardboard boxes, which usually contain color pigments.

Much of its [[gameplay]] is spent on reading the story's [[narrative]] and [[dialogue]]. The text in the game is accompanied by character [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]], which represent who S\u014d is talking to, over background art. Throughout the game, the player encounters [[CG artwork]] at certain points in the story, which take the place of the background art and character sprites. ''In Search of the Lost Future'' follows a [[Nonlinear gameplay#Branching storylines|branching plot line]] with multiple endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction.\n\nThere are four main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each heroine. Throughout gameplay, the player is given multiple options to choose from, and text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. Some decisions can lead the game to end prematurely, which offer an alternative ending to the plot. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices to further the plot to an alternate direction. Throughout gameplay, there are scenes with sexual CGs depicting S\u014d and a given heroine having sex.\n\n==Plot==\n''In Search of the Lost Future'' is set in {{nihongo|Uchihama Academy|\u5185\u6d5c\u5b66\u5712|Uchihama Gakuen}} and with the number of new students at the school increasing every year, a new school building is constructed.

The title is derived from ''[[In Search of Lost Time]]'', a French novel written by [[Marcel Proust]]. There have been two [[manga]] adaptations published by [[Kadokawa Shoten]] and [[Media Factory]]. A 12-episode [[anime]] adaptation, produced by [[Feel (animation studio)|Feel]] and directed by Naoto Hosoda, aired in Japan between October and December 2014.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Ushinawareta Mirai o Motomete screenshot.jpg|thumb|230px|left|Average dialogue and narrative in ''In Search of the Lost Future'' depicting the main character S\u014d talking to Nagisa, Airi and Yui (respectively).]]\n''In Search of the Lost Future'' is a [[Romance (love)|romance]] [[visual novel]] in which the player assumes the role of S\u014d Akiyama. Much of its [[gameplay]] is spent on reading the story's [[narrative]] and [[dialogue]]. The text in the game is accompanied by character [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]], which represent who S\u014d is talking to, over background art. Throughout the game, the player encounters [[CG artwork]] at certain points in the story, which take the place of the background art and character sprites. ''In Search of the Lost Future'' follows a [[Nonlinear gameplay#Branching storylines|branching plot line]] with multiple endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction.\n\nThere are four main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each heroine. Throughout gameplay, the player is given multiple options to choose from, and text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. Some decisions can lead the game to end prematurely, which offer an alternative ending to the plot. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices to further the plot to an alternate direction. Throughout gameplay, there are scenes with sexual CGs depicting S\u014d and a given heroine having sex.\n\n==Plot==\n''In Search of the Lost Future'' is set in {{nihongo|Uchihama Academy|\u5185\u6d5c\u5b66\u5712|Uchihama Gakuen}} and with the number of new students at the school increasing every year, a new school building is constructed. Before they move to the new building, the school will hold one last General Club Festival at the old building before it is closed down. Each of the clubs decide to give it their all to make it a success. The student executive committee asks the renowned Astronomy Club to calm the uneasiness among the students in regard to mysterious incidents at the old building. S\u014d Akiyama, a member of the Astronomy Club, inspects the central of a small earthquake and happens upon a quiet girl, Yui Furukawa, who appears to know S\u014d, and transfers late into the school year, the gears of fate slowly begin to move.\n\n==Characters==\n===Main characters===\nThe six main characters are students in the astronomy club at Uchihama Academy.\n\n;{{Nihongo|S\u014d Akiyama|\u79cb\u5c71 \u594f|Akiyama S\u014d}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Takuma Terashima]]}} (anime), Yurika Aizawa (7 years old)\n:He is a second-year student in class B and a member of the Astronomy Club at Uchihama Academy.

It has since been used by cultural institutions as a regular conference venue.\n\n== History ==\n\n[[Esztergom]] has been home to a large number of Jewish communities since the [[\u00c1rp\u00e1dian era]]. The charter sources refer to a synagogue in Esztergom as early as 1050. This is evidenced by the fact that two Jewish merchants from Regensburg, who came to the city from Russia, met their comrades in front of the synagogue. During the Reformation, Esztergom welcomed Jewish merchants and craftsmen, who built a church for themselves, and then in 1858 another prayer house on the site of today's synagogue - in the former village of Szenttam\u00e1s. About thirty years later, architect \u00d6d\u00f6n Lechner, a colleague, [[Lip\u00f3t Baumhorn]], was commissioned to design a new synagogue. This was Baumhorn's first solo work. The synagogue was designed in the spirit of late romance, originally single-storey. There was only a gallery in it for the women. It was inaugurated in 1888 by Ign\u00e1c Weisz, rabbi of Esztergom and Imm\u00e1nuel L\u0151w of Szeged. Until World War II, it was used as intended by urban and surrounding Jews. During World War II, the synagogue was bombed and badly damaged. Most of the Jews \u2014 about five hundred \u2014 were deported, and have not had a significant community in the city ever since. Since then, only the name Imah\u00e1z utca reminds of the original purpose of the building.\n\nThe empty building, which had lost its function, was awarded in 1964 to the organization of MTESZ (Association of Technical and Natural Science Associations) in the city. This was when the first major renovations began. The space was partitioned with reinforced concrete slabs, breaking down the women's gallery and equipment. From 1980 to 1981, it housed the Tech House, which until 2006 served as a conference center. Over the next few years, the organization has continually renovated and completely restructured to be able to hold conferences and lectures. It has created lecture rooms, interpreting booths, rooms suitable for receptions, and district heating has been introduced. In 1996, the roof and dome shells were renovated. Accordingly, several prestigious events took place between the walls of the former Jewish temple. Politicians often gave lectures here on their tours. In 2006, the municipality bought the Technika House for 70 million HUF. After that, the office of the Ister-Granum Euroregion was operating here for a short time, which in 2008 moved to the building of the County Hall of Botty\u00e1n J\u00e1nos Street.\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe two-story monument synagogue is 1216 square meters. On both sides of the fa\u00e7ade, there is a column-shaped, tower-like part of the building. These are connected by a triple-arched, arcaded foyer. Upstairs is the conference room with interpreting booths. The original 1888 marble staircase leads here. \n\nThe Martyr Monument in front of the building was made according to the plans of Istv\u00e1n Martsa. The original 2.5-meter bronze work was made for the monument competition in Mauthausen and was placed in the Hungarian barracks of the Auschwitz camp museum. Today's statue was erected in 1985.

A plaque commemorates the abductees on the wall of the building.\n\n== Sources ==\n* [http://epiteszforum.hu/node/12112 \u00c9p\u00edt\u00e9szf\u00f3rum - Az esztergomi zsinag\u00f3ga \u00fajj\u00e1\u00e9led\u00e9se]\n* Pifk\u00f3 P\u00e9ter \u2013 Zachar Anna:Esztergom helyt\u00f6rt\u00e9neti kronol\u00f3gi\u00e1ja a kezdetekt\u0151l 1950-ig\n* Kom\u00e1rom-Esztergom megye m\u0171eml\u00e9kjegyz\u00e9ke (2006)\n* Esztergom 2000 enciklop\u00e9dia\n* Annales Strigonienses 1994, 145. o.\n\n[[Category:Synagogues in Hungary]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Esztergom]]\n{{improve categories|date=April 2020}}\n", "name_user": "Dbracey5", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esztergom_Synagogue"}
