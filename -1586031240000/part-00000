The [[Delft Polytechnic]] in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], from which the [[Institute of Sonology]] was developed, housed the first electronic music studio in the Netherlands after the [[Philips Natuurkundig Laboratorium|Philips laboratory]] in Eindhoven, which was not generally open to composers.\n\nA select few composers were invited to work at Eindhoven, including [[Edgard Var\u00e8se]] (who created his [[Po\u00e8me \u00e9lectronique]] there in 1958) but, by 1960, Philips decided to close the facilities. It passed its equipment on to the Delft Polytechnic, which became the primary site for electronic music in the [[Netherlands]]. Administrative problems, however, caused both Boerman and [[Dick Raaijmakers]] to leave Utrecht in 1963, whereupon they began setting up a private studio in the Hague. Their facility eventually became incorporated into the [[Royal Conservatory of The Hague]], and both men became members of the faculty. Years later, in 1986, the Institute of Sonology echoed their move by transferring from Utrecht to the Royal Conservatory in the Hague.\n\nBoerman was trained in the traditional manner as a pianist and composer, and his initial exposure to the electronic music studio was both a shock and a revelation. There was relatively little \"repertoire\" in this new domain, so, while he had been struggling with [[serialism]] and \"finding his voice\", Boerman intuited that here was a vast new terrain to explore, free from the stylistic pressures (i.e., the triumvirate of [[Musique concr\u00e8te|Paris]], [[Darmstadt School|Darmstadt]], and  [[Elektronische Musik|Cologne]]) that were so powerfully felt at that time in Europe. Raaijmakers, on the other hand, had been studying broadcasting, recording, and applied electronics at [[Philips]], so was more drawn into the world of studio composition.\n\n==Life and career==\nBoerman studied at the Royal Conservatory of Music in his home town, with L\u00e9on Orthel (piano) and, from 1945, with [[Hendrik Andriessen]] (composition). From 1956 onwards, Boerman worked in the electronic studios of Delft Polytechnic, Utrecht State University and of The Hague Royal Conservatory of Music, where he has also taught electronic composition (after 1974) and piano. Since the 1970s, he has integrated live electronic music with instrumental and [[vocal music]]. Boerman has also composed theatre and ballet music, \"music for the listening museum\" and, in collaboration with architect [[Jan Hoogstad]], \"music as architectonic space\". Since 1974, as Professor of Electronic Composition at the Royal Conservatory in the Hague, he has assisted many young composers in finding their way forward. Notable students include [[Sinta Wullur]].\n\n==Prizes==\nBoerman received the [[Matthijs Vermeulen Award]] Prize for his entire body of work in 1981<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fondspodiumkunsten.nl/en/activities/the_matthijs_vermeulen_award/|title=The Matthijs Vermeulen Award|last=Podiumkunsten|first=Fonds|website=fondspodiumkunsten.nl|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> and the [[Willem Pijper]] Prize for his composition ''Vocalise 1994'' in 1997.

It was followed by an \"orthodox\" tape: ''Kompositie 1979''. For the ensemble ''Het Nieuwe Leven'', he composed \"Weerstand\" (\"Resistance\", 1982) for tape and percussion, and later \"Ontketening\" (\"Unchainment\", 1983), for tape and metal instruments.

Other towns in the county include [[Trim, County Meath|Trim]], [[Kells, County Meath|Kells]], [[Laytown]], [[Ashbourne, County Meath|Ashbourne]], [[Dunboyne]], and [[Slane]].\n\nIt is one of only two counties outside the west of Ireland to have an official [[Gaeltacht]] (the other being [[County Waterford]], which has the Gaeltacht [[Ring, County Waterford|Ring]]) and the only county in Leinster to have an official Gaeltacht.\n\n==Geography and political subdivisions==\nMeath is the 14th-largest of Ireland's 32 counties by area, and the eighth-largest in terms of population.<ref>{{cite book |first=Eoghan |last=Corry |title=The GAA Book of Lists |publisher=Hodder Headline Ireland |year=2005 |id= |pages=186\u2013191 |isbn=0-340-89695-7}}</ref> It is the second-largest of Leinster's 12 counties in size, and the third-largest in terms of population. Meath borders seven counties - [[County Dublin|Dublin]] and [[County Louth|Louth]] to the east, [[Westmeath]] and [[Offaly]] to the west, [[County Kildare|Kildare]] to the south, and [[County Cavan|Cavan]] and [[County Monaghan|Monaghan]] to the north. Meath also has a {{convert|12|km|0|abbr=on}} coastline, which stretches along the [[Irish Sea]] between the [[River Boyne|Boyne]] and [[Delvin River|Delvin]] rivers, making it the second shortest coastline of any coastal county. The county town, Navan, is the largest settlement in Meath, and is situated on the River Boyne in the middle of the county.

However, it is also one of the most densely populated counties in Ireland, with a population density of 83.2 people per km2. Centuries of exhaustive harvesting and reclamation for agriculture have severely reduced the extent of [[bogland]] in the county, especially in comparison to the neighbouring [[Midlands Region, Ireland|Midland]] counties. However, small areas of bogland survived, such as Jamestown Bog, Girley Bog and Killyconny Bog, and are currently protected as either [[List of Special Areas of Conservation in the Republic of Ireland|Special Areas of Conservation]] (SACs) or Natural Heritage Areas (NHAs).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npws.ie/protected-sites|title=Protected Sites in Ireland|work=NPWS}}</ref>\n\nThe River Boyne, at {{convert|112|km|mi|abbr=on}} in length, is Meath's dominant geographic feature and is synonymous with the county, having defined its history and culture over millennia. The two most prominent tributaries of the Boyne are the [[Leinster Blackwater]], which has its source in Cavan and flows south for {{convert|68|km|mi|abbr=on}} before joining the Boyne at Navan, and the [[Enfield Blackwater]], which has its source in Kildare and flows north for {{convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on}} before joining the Boyne at Donore. In the east of the county, both the [[Nanny (river)|River Nanny]] and the [[Delvin River]] flow to the Irish sea, with the latter demarcating the border with County Dublin.\n\nAs of 2017, there is a total of {{convert|13326|ha|0|abbr=on}} of forest cover in the county, representing 5.7% of total land area. This is an increase from just {{convert|11200|ha|0|abbr=on}} (4.8%) in 2006.  Nevertheless, Meath is Ireland's third-least forested county and remains well below the national average of 11% forest cover.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.agriculture.gov.ie/nfi/nfisecondcycle2012/|title=National Forestry Inventory, Second Cycle 2012|work=DAFM}}</ref> Historically, Meath was extensively forested, but experienced a near total deforestation between the 16th and 18th centuries. Although it has rebounded in recent years, the low of forest cover compared to other counties can be explained by the lack of a significant commercial forestry industry within the county. Meath is one of the smallest contributors to the national timber supply, and over two-thirds of Meath's forests are [[Broadleaf forest|broadleaf]] - the highest of any county - as opposed to more commercially viable [[conifers]]. Additionally, three-quarters of forests within the county are privately owned.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.agriculture.gov.ie/nfi/nfithirdcycle2017/nationalforestinventorypublications2017/|title=National Forestry Inventory, Third Cycle 2017|work=DAFM}}</ref>\n====Climate====\nUnder [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], Meath experiences a maritime [[temperate]] [[oceanic climate]] with cool winters, mild humid summers, and a lack of temperature extremes. [[Met \u00c9ireann]] records the climate data for Meath from their station at [[Dunsany, County Meath|Dunsany]], situation at {{convert|83|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level.  The average maximum January temperature is {{convert|7.3|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}, while the average maximum July temperature is {{convert|19.6|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. On average, the sunniest months are May and June, while the wettest month is October with {{convert|87|mm|0|abbr=on}} of rain, and the driest month is June with {{convert|67|mm|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.met.ie/climate/available-data/historical-data|title=Met Eireann, Historical Data|work=Met Eireann}}</ref> Humidity is high year round and rainfall is evenly distributed throughout the year. A number of [[Weather station|synoptic stations]] which record rainfall are located throughout the county. The driest parts of the county are in the east and south, while the wettest are in the west. [[Julianstown]] near the east coast receives {{convert|781|mm|0|abbr=on}} of rainfall per year, while [[Oldcastle, County Meath|Oldcastle]] in the west receives {{convert|1002|mm|0|abbr=on}}. The annual precipitation at Dunsany is {{convert|847|mm|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nSnow showers generally occur between November and March, but prolonged or heavy snow events are rare. Although frost is common in the central and western areas of the county, temperatures typically fall below 0\u00b0C (32\u00b0F) on just a few days per year. The lowest ever temperature in Meath was recorded in December 2010, at {{convert|-13.3|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.met.ie/cms/assets/uploads/2017/08/ColdSpell10.pdf|title=The Extreme Cold Spell of November-December 2010|work=Met Eireann}}</ref> Summer daytime temperatures range between {{convert|15|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|22|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}, with temperatures rarely going beyond {{convert|25|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. As with rainfall, the sunniest areas of the county are located along the coast. The climate gets progressively duller and wetter inland due to the convective development of clouds over land.\n\n===Geology===\n[[File:1-loughcrew3.jpg|thumb|right|230px|The [[Slieve na Calliagh]] hills]]\nThe county's geological landscape is predominantly made up of [[Lower Carboniferous]] [[limestone]], which underlies approximately 75% of the county. These were laid down following the erosion of mountain ranges which formed due to the closure of the [[Iapetus Ocean]]. The eroded mountains became basins in which limestone sediments and carbonate [[Mudstone|mud]] were deposited. The oldest rocks in the county are [[Ordovician]] in age and are found in thin layers near [[Slane]] and at [[Stamullen]], while the youngest rocks are of [[Paleogene]] age, and were formed as a result of volcanic activity. These are found in small [[Dike (geology)|dykes]] and [[Sill (geology)|sills]] throughout the county. [[Extensional tectonics|Crustal stretching]] beneath Ireland during the Carboniferous allowed fluids to infiltrate through faults in the rock, and extensive mineralisation occurred.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geoschol.com/counties/MEATH_GEOLOGY.pdf|title=Geology of County Meath|work=geoschol.com}}</ref> Most notably, zinc-bearing [[Sphalerite]] and lead-bearing [[Galena]] were deposited in vast quantities, giving Ireland the highest concentration of zinc per square kilometre on Earth.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://researchrepository.ucd.ie/bitstream/10197/9364/1/54_Hollis_et_al_2017_ICIW_Clumped_Conference.pdf|title=A comparison between clumped C-O and fluid inclusion temperatures for carbonates associated with Irish-type Zn-Pb orebodies|work=Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris}}</ref> The ubiquity of these minerals gave rise to the term \"[[Carbonate-hosted lead-zinc ore deposits|Irish-type]]\" lead-zinc deposits, which is a descriptive term for lead-zinc deposits hosted in carbonate rocks.<ref>{{Cite journal|journal=Applied Earth Science IMM Transactions Section B|volume=125|issue=2|date=2016|pages=75\u201376|doi=10.1080/03717453.2016.1166607|title=The Giant Navan carbonate-hosted Zn\u2013Pb deposit: exploration and geology: 1970\u20132015|first=John|last=Ashton|author2=Blakeman, Rob.}}</ref>\n\nMeath's landscape was shaped during the [[Last Glacial Period]], which ended 11,700 years ago. The soils of the county are mostly derived from [[glacial till]], consisting of a mix of clay, sand and gravel which were deposited by glacial melt-water. In the north of the county near the border with Cavan, a small series of [[Drumlin|drumlins]] were formed from [[Boulder clay|boulder clay]]. Loughs typically form in between the poorly-drained inter-drumlin areas, however unlike in neighbouring Cavan and Westmeath, Meath has no sizable loughs, other than [[Lough Sheelin]], on which the county shares a small coastline in its westernmost tip.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.teagasc.ie/media/website/environment/soil/Meath.pdf|title=Soils of County Meath|work=Teagasc}}</ref>\n\nMeath is largely flat and much of the county lies below {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea-level. The minor hills in the far west of the county at [[Loughcrew]], and in the north at Carrickleck are the only upland areas of any significance. [[Slieve na Calliagh]], at just {{convert|276|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height, is the highest point in the county, making it the second lowest [[List of Irish counties by highest point|county top]] in Ireland.

The ancient monuments of the Boyne Valley were assimilated into Celtic culture and mythology, with [[C\u00fa Chulainn]] said to have been conceived at Newgrange. Furthermore, tradition states that [[Sl\u00e1ine mac Dela]], of the [[Fir Bolg]], cleared the forest at Br\u00fa na B\u00f3inne and built the monuments, becoming the first High-King of Ireland. It was during the Celtic period that Meath was divided into 8 [[T\u00faath|t\u00faatha]], the primary political unit of [[Celtic Ireland]].

The feud was eventually resolved, and as part of the resolution it was decided that the position of King of Tara would alternate between the northern and southern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill septs. The title alternated between the two septs for over 500 years, with every second king traveling south from Ulster for an inauguration ceremony at Tara.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Simms|first1=Katharine|title=From Kings to Warlords: The Changing Political Structure of Gaelic Ireland in the Later Middle Ages|date=2000|publisher=Boydell Press|page=11}}</ref> By 740, [[Domnall Midi]] of the [[Clann Cholm\u00e1in]] dynasty, the most powerful branch of the southern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill, had conquered or subdued all neighboring clans in Meath, and the U\u00ed N\u00e9ill were recognised as their [[suzerain]].

The ascendancy of this longtime rival kingdom posed a serious threat to High King [[M\u00e1el Sechnaill mac Domnaill]], so the two leaders met at [[Clonfert]] in 997 and agreed upon a truce, whereby Boru was granted overlordship of the southern half of the island. The [[Kingdom of Leinster]] immediately rebelled against Boru and allied with the Norse [[Kingdom of Dublin]]. Mide and Munster formed a defensive alliance and, after a series of campaigns throughout 998\u2013999, crushed the forces of Leinster and Dublin, which both became [[Vassal state|vassals]] of Munster. \n\nBoru now believed that Munster was the most powerful kingdom in Ireland and therefore he, and not M\u00e1el Sechnaill, should be High-King. M\u00e1el Sechnaill's claim to the kingship was challenged by Boru in 1002 at the Hill of Tara. The Meath king requested a month-long truce to rally his subordinates to his side, which Boru accepted, however M\u00e1el Sechnaill was quickly abandoned by his northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill kinsmen.

Patrick was then summoned to the king's court and so impressed L\u00f3egaire with his teachings that he was allowed to continue preaching Christianity across Ireland. While Christian missionaries were documented in Ireland long before the time of Saint Patrick, and accounts of his activities are heavily shrouded in myth, what is known is that by the late 6th century AD Christianity had supplanted [[Ancient Celtic religion|Celtic Paganism]] in every corner of the island.<ref>{{cite book|title = The Life and Acts of Saint Patrick: The Archbishop, Primate and Apostle of Ireland | publisher = Hibernia Press Company | author = Edmund Lenthal Swifte | date = 1809 | url = https://archive.org/details/lifeandactssain00jocegoog | via = Archive.org }}</ref> In a similar manner to how the Celts assimilated prehistoric traditions into their beliefs, many Celtic pagan beliefs and festivities were adapted to [[Celtic Christianity]], such as [[Samhain]], which became [[Halloween]], and [[Imbolc]], which became St. Brigid's Day.\n\nBy the 7th century a network of monasteries and religious settlements had been set up throughout Ireland and [[D\u00e1l Riata|Western Scotland]], supported by local kings and chieftains. Beginning at this time, the \"''Golden Age of Irish Christianity''\" lasted for several centuries. Irish Scholars preserved invaluable [[Classical Latin|Latin texts]] and Gaelic monasteries developed into centres of learning which attracted theologians from across Europe. These monasteries sent missionaries to northern and central Europe to re-ignite Christianity and Latin tradition in areas where it had lapsed following the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. One of Ireland's national nicknames, \"''the land of saints and scholars''\", is in reference to this period. \n\nPatronage of the Church was also used as a political tool to project wealth and prestige in Irish kingdoms until the 16th century. Successive High Kings and Kings of Meath supported the establishment of prominent religious settlements and institutions, such as [[Abbey of Kells|Kells]] and [[Clonard Abbey]], the latter of which taught Ireland's most significant saints, dubbed the [[Twelve Apostles of Ireland]]. During the golden age, the monasteries of Meath produced several of Ireland's most famous artifacts, which are considered to be among the finest examples of [[Insular art|Insular]] and medieval [[Christian art]] in existence.<ref>O'Donovan, John. \"[http://www.ucc.ie/celt/online/G102003.html The Irish Charters in the Book of Kells]\".

The most distinctive feature of Irish monasteries, their [[Irish round tower|round towers]], were built in response to these Viking raids. Eventually, the Vikings established kingdoms and founded [[History of Ireland (800\u20131169)#Second Viking age (914\u2013980)|Ireland's first cities]] along coastal areas, including in neighboring [[Dublin]]. The High Kings and lesser kingdoms waged near-continuous war with these [[Norse-Gael]] settlers for over two centuries.\n\n===Lordship of Ireland (1169-1542)===\n====Norman Period====\n{{Main|Lordship of Meath}}\n[[File:Trim Castle 6.jpg|thumb|[[Trim Castle]], the largest Norman castle in Ireland]]\nIn 1166, [[Diarmait Mac Murchada]] was banished from Ireland by the High King [[Ruaidr\u00ed Ua Conchobair]] for the abduction of Lady of Meath [[Derbforgaill ingen Maeleachlainn]], wife of [[Tigern\u00e1n Ua Ruairc]], King of [[Breifne]]. Mac Murchada returned with Norman allies and landed at Bannow in [[County Wexford|Wexford]] in 1169, after which they conquered northward throughout 1169\u201370, initiating the [[Norman Invasion of Ireland]]. In response, the High King assembled an alliance which included King Magnus Ua M\u00e1el Sechlainn of Meath as well as soldiers from [[Connacht]], Breifne and [[Kingdom of Dublin|Dublin]] along with their respective kings. They confronted Mac Murchada's forces at [[Ferns, County Wexford|Ferns]] and an agreement was reached whereby Mac Murchada was acknowledged as king of Leinster, in return for acknowledging Ruaidr\u00ed as his overlord and agreeing to send his foreign allies away permanently.<ref>''A. J. Otway-Ruthven'', \"A History of Medieval Ireland\", 1968, p45.</ref> However, Mac Murchada breached the agreement and enlisted more Normans to his side before continuing his conquests, capturing [[Dublin]] in 1171 and forcing the capitulation of Magnus Ua M\u00e1el Sechlainn. \n[[File:Hugh de Lacy.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Hugh de Lacy, Lord of Meath|Hugh de Lacy]], 1st Lord of Meath]]\n[[File:The Pale According to the Statute of 1488 edit.jpg|thumb|[[The Pale]] \u2013 According to Statute of 1488]]\nFollowing Mac Murchada's death in May 1171, [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Strongbow]] succeeded him as [[King of Leinster]] and, once again, Magnus joined the High-King's coalition army to oust the Normans, however their forces were routed during an unsuccessful siege of Dublin. Fearing that Strongbow was growing too powerful and might set up his own independent kingdom in Ireland, [[Henry II of England]] landed in Ireland in October 1171 to establish control over both the Irish and the Normans. Henry's campaign in Ireland was largely successfully and he managed to reign in the Normans as well as a few Irish kingdoms which also submitted to him. Most crucially, he retained the city of Dublin, and [[Hugh de Lacy, Lord of Meath|Baron Hugh de Lacy]] was made its bailiff.{{sfn|Kingsford|1892}} Henry's appointment of de Lacy was intended to act as a counterbalance to Strongbow. However, in order to achieve this, de Lacy would need a strong holding on Irish soil and it was decided that the Kingdom of Meath was to be granted to de Lacy.\n\nThis grant posed an issue for Henry as the previous decade had been a tumultuous time in Meath. There were four rival heirs to the kingship and each claimant held a different part of the kingdom. The strongest claim came from the King of Breifne, [[Tigern\u00e1n Ua Ruairc]], who - through conquest, marriage and an alliance with the church - had subsumed almost all of eastern Meath into his kingdom by the time of the Norman arrival.<ref>[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~ruairc/ocastle.htm Ancestry.com \u2013 Kingdom of Br\u00e9ifne]</ref> Strongbow also had nominal claim to Meath as King of Leinster. A war of succession within the [[Clann Cholm\u00e1in]] dynasty meant that both Magnus and Art Ua M\u00e1el Sechlainn were also vying for the kingship of Meath. To circumvent this problem, Henry defined the borders of Meath as they had been in [[1153 in Ireland|1153]] and ignored all subsequent subdivisions. In March 1172 he granted control of Meath to de Lacy on the condition that de Lacy could personally retain the kingdom with near total autonomy, if he could conquer it.\n\nShortly after Henry left Ireland, Hugh de Lacy invaded Meath, setting up countless [[motte and bailey]] fortifications throughout the kingdom. de Lacy made the ecclesiastic centre of Trim his stronghold, constructing a huge ringwork castle defended by a stout double palisade and external ditch on top of the hill. With de Lacy now at the border of Ua Ruairc's outermost settlement of Kells, a parlay was arranged and the two leaders met on the [[Hill of Ward]] for negotiations. During these negotiations, a dispute erupted and de Lacy's men killed Ua Ruairc. Both sides blamed the other, with the [[Irish annals]] reporting that Ua Ruairc was \"''treacherously slain''\".<ref name=martin99>Martin (2008), p.99</ref>\n\nBy 1175, de Lacy had conquered the entire territory, executing Magnus Ua M\u00e1el Sechlainn that year. He expanded existing settlements into charter towns throughout Meath, including Trim, Athboy, Kells and Navan; and he married [[Rose N\u00ed Conchobair]], the High-King's daughter, in order to cement his claim as Lord of Meath.\n\nHugh de Lacy died in 1186 and several informal divisions and feuds among de Lacy's descendants over control of the lordship followed over the next century. The Lordship was formally shired in 1297 into the County of Meath.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.historyireland.com/early-modern-history-1500-1700/geographical-loyalty-counties-palatinates-boroughs-and-ridings/|title='Geographical loyalty'?

Firstly, there was a reconsolidation and resurgence in the power of the Irish kingdoms which had been shattered during the Norman invasion. Secondly, the onset of the [[Black Death]] devastated nucleated settlements such as walled Anglo-Norman towns, but had a significantly smaller impact in more sparsely populated Gaelic kingdoms. Lastly, and of most concern to the English crown, the gradual [[More Irish than the Irish themselves|gaelicisation of the Normans]] meant that many of the most prominent Anglo-Norman families, who were meant to act as England's [[Viceroy|viceroys]] in Ireland, no longer followed English laws or customs.<ref>The introduction to the text of the Statutes of Kilkenny, 1366, (pp.4\u20137)</ref> \n\nEnglish authority continued to retreat eastward until Trim, Athboy and Kells were the outermost settlements of [[The Pale]], an area centered around [[Dublin]] where English law was still obeyed. This situation meant that by the 1500s part of County Meath was within the Pale while other areas - which were inhabited by both the Gaelic Irish as well as Normans who were once loyal to the Crown - were now outside the control of the authorities in Dublin.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=Steven G.|title=Defending English Ground: War and Peace in Meath and Northumberland, 1460\u20131542 |url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=oxcaCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA62 |pages=62\u201364 |accessdate=2015-06-24|date=2015-05-07|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199696291}}</ref>\n\n===Kingdom of Ireland (1542-1800)===\n====Tudor Conquest====\n{{Main|Tudor conquest of Ireland}}\n[[File:Dunmoe Castle - geograph.org.uk - 290230.jpg|thumb|Tudor-era [[Dunmoe Castle]]]]\nThe [[papal bull]] ''[[Laudabiliter]]'' of [[Pope Adrian IV]], issued in 1155, recognised the [[House of Plantagenet|Angevin]] monarch as ''Dominus Hibernae'' (Latin for \"Lord of Ireland\"). When [[Pope Clement VII]] excommunicated [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] in 1533, the constitutional position of the lordship in Ireland became uncertain. Following Henry's split with the church, the [[Tudors]] heralded the end of monastic Meath. Church Lands which comprised roughly one third of the county were seized and granted to [[Protestant]] English statesmen and soldiers as a form of payment. Monasteries were suppressed and their treasures were either looted or scattered by Irish scholars to protect them. \n<ref>The introduction to the text of the Statutes of Kilkenny, 1366, (pp.4\u20137)</ref>\nMeath was invaded by [[T\u00edr Eoghain|Tyrone]] and its allies in 1539 who raided as far south as Navan, which was razed to the ground.

For this reason, and also to address England's waning power in Ireland, Henry proclaimed the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] in 1542, with himself as its monarch. The following year, the [[Counties of Meath and Westmeath Act 1543|Counties of Meath and Westmeath Act]] was passed by the [[Parliament of Ireland]] and Meath was officially divided in two. The act was intended to allow a more effective administration in both counties, particularly in Westmeath, which England had lost control of. A new shire town at [[Mullingar]] was established along with four new [[Barony (Ireland)|baronies]], while Trim retained its status as the shire town of Meath.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://books.google.com/?id=HXhaAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA232#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Statutes at Large: From the third year of Edward the Second, A.D. 1310 to the fifth year of George the Third, A.D. 1761 inclusive|year=1765}}</ref>\n\nDespite the general loyalty of the \"[[Normans in Ireland#\"Old English\" vs. New English|Old English]]\" of Meath to the government in Dublin, the introduction of new [[Anglican]] English settlers, seen as more reliable by the English government, undermined the power of the Anglo-Norman aristocracy who had remained overwhelmingly Catholic following the [[Reformation]]. Although there was fervent anti-Catholic sentiment in England at this time, no punitive laws were enacted out of fear that they would provoke further rebellion. However, this changed following England's victory over the Irish kingdoms in the [[Nine Years' War (Ireland)|Nine Years' War]] in 1603. With Ireland subdued, the English pursued a series of [[Penal Laws]] restricting the rights of Catholics, which were accelerated following the [[Gunpowder Plot]] of 1605.\n\n====Protestant Ascendancy====\n[[File:MANTE(1800) p3.072 CROMWELL TAKING DROGHEDA - 1649.jpg|thumb|[[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]] shelling [[Drogheda]] from across the Boyne, 1649]]\n[[File:BattleOfBoyne.gif|thumb|[[Battle of the Boyne]], 1690]]\nThe uneasy peace that had persisted between Catholics and Protestants for several decades unraveled when the anti-Catholic [[Long Parliament]] gained traction in England in 1640.

Sir John Read was sent to deliver it; however, gripped by anti-Catholic hysteria, officials in Dublin seized Read and tortured him, questioning whether the King and his Catholic wife [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta]] were in league with the Irish rebels.\n\nAs the rebellion intensified, the Ulstermen once again conquered southward into Meath, crushing an English garrison at the [[Battle of Julianstown]]. A contingent of Old English lords led by [[Viscount Gormanston]] rode out to halt their advance.

Former aristocratic families were forced to send their children abroad for education to Irish seminaries in [[Kingdom of France|France]] and the [[Spanish Netherlands]]. The \"New English\" along with those who had converted to Anglicanism occupied the Parliament, becoming what would later be termed the [[Protestant Ascendancy]]. This period also saw an influx of [[Huguenots]] into Meath, and surnames such as Beaufort and Metge appeared in the county for the first time.\n\nSome Old English families were able to recover their lands and return to Meath following the restoration of [[James II of England|King James II]]. Although James did little to improve the overall situation of Irish Catholics, he was backed by them during the [[Glorious Revolution]], while Protestants overwhelmingly backed [[William III of England|William of Orange]] during the [[Williamite War in Ireland]]. The defeat of the [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]] at the [[Battle of the Boyne]] in July 1690 forced James to flee to France, ending the prospect of an autonomous Irish kingdom. This battle is seen as a seminal event in Irish history and is still [[The Twelfth|celebrated]] every year by [[Unionism in Ireland|Ulster Unionists]].\n\nTowards the end of the 18th century the Penal Laws were relaxed and Catholic merchant families such as [[Fay (surname)|Fay]] and [[Connolly (surname)|Connolly]] were granted trading privileges in Trim and Navan.

During the war, Ireland had become known as the \"''Food larder of Europe''\", and the tenant farmers and landlords of Meath relied heavily on [[tillage]], which fetched an artificially high price due to a surge in wartime demand. Further, a substantial number of Irish soldiers who comprised as much as 25% of the entire [[British Army]] and [[Royal Navy|Navy]] during the war were now made redundant. As post-war trade between Britain and Europe recovered, demand for Irish tillage collapsed; however, rents remained the same and the population continued to boom.

Nationalist sentiment was widespread in Meath, as reflected in the [[Meath (UK Parliament constituency)|Meath Parliamentary constituency]], which returned several of 19th century Ireland's most prominent nationalist politicians, including [[Daniel O'Connell]], [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] and [[Michael Davitt]]. Owing to its symbolic place in the national psyche, Daniel O'Connell held a rally on the [[Hill of Tara]] in August 1843 which was attended by between 500,000 and 1 million people, making it one of the largest crowd gatherings in Irish history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navanhistory.ie/index.php?page=o-connell-at-tara|title=O'Connell at Tara|work=Navan Historical Society}}</ref> \n\nTo address rising poverty and growing unrest in Ireland, the British government set up [[Workhouse|workhouses]] in the 1830s and began constructing [[Rail transport in Ireland|railroads]]. However, these efforts were largely unsuccessful and the impoverished of Meath, pushed to brink by high rents and mass unemployment, were wiped out by the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] of 1845\u201349. Having reached over 183,000 in 1841, the population of Meath would fall to 67,000 by 1900. The famine had a lasting cultural, societal and linguistic effect on the county. Pre-famine census records show that Meath had been a region with an \"''undoubted Irish speaking majority''\"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wia5nginsawC|title=Rebuilding the Celtic Languages|work=Diarmuid O'N\u00e9ill|isbn=9780862437237|last1=O'N\u00e9ill|first1=Diarmuid|year=2005}}</ref>, but by the late 1800s the [[Irish language]] was virtually extinct within the county. The famine-era workhouse and mass grave at Dunshaughlin is today a memorial to its victims. \n\nThe famine shed light on the detrimental effects that Ireland's land laws were having on the economic and social well-being of the country, and the British government's lacklustre response to the crisis further strengthened the cause of Irish nationalists. The Protestant Ascendancy went into steep decline following the famine and many landholders were effectively bankrupt, leading to the [[ad hoc]] sale of lands into unproductive use. The push for reform escalated in the 1870s into a period of sporadic violence and civil unrest known as the [[Land War]]s.\n\n[[Thomas Brennan (Irish Land League)|Thomas Brennan]], of [[Yellow Furze]], co-founded the  [[Irish National Land League]] in 1879 alongside Michael Davitt. His staunch [[Irish republicanism|republicanism]] and socialist leanings put him at odds with the League's executive, and he was excluded from the [[Irish National League]] set up by Parnell in 1882. Brennan moved to the [[United States]] and raised money for the republican cause, advocating total Irish independence as opposed to [[Home Rule]] to the [[Irish-American]] diaspora.<ref>[http://www.astonisher.com/archives/mjb/irishlit/irishlit_ch16.html Malcolm Brown, ''The Politics of Irish Literature''.

The act set up urban and rural districts as well as county councils to take over local government from landlords. Under the reforms, small sub-councils and boroughs were abolished and [[Meath County Council]] was granted full control over the jurisdiction. The council sat at Navan, which became the new [[county town]] of Meath, ending Trim's 600-year status as Meath's shire town.<ref name=beckett>{{cite book |title=The Making of Modern Ireland 1603 \u2013 1923 |last=Beckett |first=J C |year=1966 |publisher=Faber & Faber |location=London |isbn=0-571-09267-5 |page=406 }}</ref><ref name=gailey>{{cite journal |last1=Gailey |first1=Andrew |date=May 1984 |title=Unionist Rhetoric and Irish Local Government Reform, 1895-9 |journal=Irish Historic Studies |volume=24 |issue=93 |pages=52\u201368 |jstor=30008026 |doi= 10.1017/S0021121400034027}}</ref>\n\n===20th Century===\n[[File:Fireworks at the First Tailteann Games August 15, 1924.jpg|thumb|First modern revival of Ancient Meath's [[Tailteann Games (ancient)|Tailteann Games]], 1924]]\nThe reforms proposed by the UK government failed to stem the rising tide of nationalism, which spilled over into the 20th century as the [[1916 Easter Rising]]. The Battle of Ashbourne was one of the few skirmishes which took place outside of Dublin during the rising, and was its sole success. On 28 April 1916, members of the [[Irish Volunteers|Dublin Volunteers]] Fifth ([[Fingal]]) battalion, led by [[Thomas Ashe]], surrounded a [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] (RIC) police station in [[Ashbourne, County Meath|Ashbourne]] and demanded their surrender. RIC reinforcements were dispatched from Navan and upon arriving at the scene a firefight ensued during which 8 RIC members were killed and 15 wounded, forcing them to retreat. On the orders of [[Patrick Pearse]], Ashe and his battalion surrendered the following day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meathchronicle.ie/news/1916centenary/articles/2016/05/05/4119283-the-1916-series-the-battle-of-ashbourne/|title=The 1916 Series: The Battle of Ashbourne|work=Meath Chronicle}}</ref>\n\nMeath's [[Eamonn Duggan]] served as the [[Irish Republican Army (1919\u20131922)|IRA's]] director of intelligence during and after the rising, and was a signatory of the [[Anglo-Irish treaty]] in 1921. Meath largely sided with the pro-treaty forces during the [[Irish Civil War|Civil War]], with the [[Louth\u2013Meath (D\u00e1il constituency)|Louth\u2013Meath constituency]] returning one anti-treaty and four pro-treaty [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TDs]] in the [[1922 Irish general election|1922 general election]]. Duggan later joined [[Cumann na nGaedheal]] and held various ministerial offices until his death in 1936. Following independence, various government-backed [[Gaelic revival]] efforts were centered on the county and its history, including the foundation of 5 [[Gaeltacht]] areas within Meath, and the symbolic hosting of the [[Tailteann Games (ancient)|Tailteann Games]]. \n\nThe declining population of Meath gradually stabilised as emigration balanced with high natural birth rates. Outward migration from the county remained substantial until the reforms of [[Sean Lemass]] in the 1960s strengthened industry by injecting capital into the economy and abandoning the policy of [[autarky]].<ref>Garvin T.

By the 1971 census Meath's population had surpassed 70,000 for the first time in eighty years. Despite a [[Economic history of the Republic of Ireland#1980 to early 1990s|severe recession]] in the 1980s, the growth of Meath's economy and population became exponential in the late 1990s and early 2000s during the [[Celtic Tiger]] era. \n\nAs places such as Trim, Navan and Kells developed into major commuter towns of Dublin, the county grew increasingly reliant on the [[Overheating (economics)|overheated]] construction sector, leaving Meath hard-hit by the [[Irish property bubble|property collapse]] in [[Post-2008 Irish banking crisis|2008]].

This increase was mainly due to a baby boom locally. The population then continued to increase at a constant rate, before increasing at an explosive rate between 1996 and 2002, from 109,732 to 134,005. This is due primarily to economic factors, with the return of residents to live in the county, and also an echo effect of the 1970s baby boom.

In total, 5 Irish-speaking settlements were set up in Meath between 1935 and 1939 - R\u00e1th Chairn, Baile Ghib, Kilbride, Clongill and Allenstown. They were established on fertile land which had been allowed to fall into disrepair by [[absentee landlords]] and was consequently repossessed by the [[Irish Land Commission]].

They were primarily from [[Connemara]], but some families were also from [[County Kerry|Kerry]]. \n\nOver the years, Kilbride was subsumed into R\u00e1th Chairn, and Clongill was subsumed into Baile Ghib. The fifth and final Gaeltacht to be set up - Allenstown - failed after a generation, as several Irish-speaking families moved away and day-to-day use of the Irish language failed to take hold amongst the children of those who remained.

However, in recent years settlements in the south and east of the county such as Ashbourne, Dunboyne and [[Bettystown]] have expanded significantly, and many of the county's largest and fastest growing towns are now located in these areas.\n{{Largest cities\n| name         = Largest towns\n| country      = Meath (Census 2016)\n| stat_ref     = Source:<ref name=largest>{{cite web |url=https://www.cso.ie/en/ |title=CSO|date= |website= |publisher=Central Statistics Office |accessdate= June 8, 2019}}</ref>\n| list_by_pop  =\n| class        = nav\n| div_name     =\n| div_link     = D\u00e1il constituencies{{!}}Constituency\n| city_1 = Navan\n| div_1 = Meath West (D\u00e1il constituency){{!}}Meath West\n| pop_1 = 30,173\n| img_1 = MarketSquareNavan.JPG\n| city_2 = Ashbourne, County Meath{{!}}Ashbourne\n| div_2 = Meath East (D\u00e1il constituency){{!}}Meath East\n| pop_2 = 12,679 \n| img_2 = New Shopping District Ashbourne 2006-4-30.jpg\n| city_3 = Laytown-Bettystown-Mornington\n| div_3 = Louth (D\u00e1il constituency){{!}}Louth\n| pop_3 = 11,872 \n| img_3 = Neptune Hotel, Bettystown.jpg\n| city_4 = Ratoath\n| div_4 = Meath East (D\u00e1il constituency){{!}}Meath East\n| pop_4 = 9,533 \n| img_4 = Ratoath - Holy Trinity church.jpg\n| city_5 = Trim, County Meath{{!}}Trim\n| div_5 = Meath West (D\u00e1il constituency){{!}}Meath West\n| pop_5 = 9,194 \n| img_5 = Jackson_County_Courthouse_Independence_MO-cropped.jpg\n| city_6 = Dunboyne\n| div_6 = Meath East (D\u00e1il constituency){{!}}Meath East\n| pop_6 = 7,272 \n| img_6 =\n| city_7 =Kells, County Meath{{!}}Kells\n| div_7 = Meath West (D\u00e1il constituency){{!}}Meath West\n| pop_7 = 6,135\n| img_7 =\n| city_8 = Drogheda{{!}}Drogheda (Southern Environs)\n| div_8 = Louth (D\u00e1il constituency){{!}}Louth\n| pop_8 = 5,000\n| img_8 =\n| city_9 = Duleek\n| div_9 = Meath East (D\u00e1il constituency){{!}}Meath East\n| pop_9 = 4,219\n| img_9 =\n| city_10 = Dunshaughlin\n| div_10 = Meath East (D\u00e1il constituency){{!}}Meath East\n| pop_10 = 4,035\n| img_10 =\n}}\n\n==Economy==\nThe [[Central Statistics Office (Ireland)|Central Statistics Office]] estimates that Meath's Total Household Income in 2017 was \u20ac5.253 billion, ranking 6th among Irish counties. Meath also ranks 6th in the country by per capita disposable income, at \u20ac20,493 or 95.8% of the State average.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/er/cirgdp/countyincomesandregionalgdp2016/|title=County Incomes and Regional GDP|work=CSO}}</ref> Meath residents are also the 6th highest per capita tax contributors to the State, returning a total of \u20ac1.311 billion in taxes in 2017 \u2013 roughly equivalent to the entire [[Midlands Region, Ireland|Midlands Region]]. Major industries include services, retail, agriculture and food processing, mining, manufacturing and tourism.\n\n===Services, Retail and Hospitality===\n[[File:C\u00fa Chulainn Coaster Arial View.jpg|thumb|''[[The C\u00fa Chulainn Coaster|C\u00fa Chulainn]]'', Ireland's biggest rollercoaster.]]\nServices, retail and the hospitality industry are the primary employers in the county. Navan was historically a manufacturing town, and involved in the household goods sector. Navan was also a centre in the Irish carpet-making industry, before this was lost to overseas competition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.navanhistory.ie/index.php?page=navan-carpets|title=Navan Historical Society - Navan Carpets |website=www.navanhistory.ie |accessdate=2 May 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171119162310/http://www.navanhistory.ie/index.php?page=navan-carpets |archivedate=19 November 2017 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nTourism benefits from the abundance of historically important pre-historic and early Christian sites, as well as castles and manor houses within the county, many of which are in currently in use as hotels. Due to its rich history, Meath is marketed by [[F\u00e1ilte Ireland]], the country's national tourism agency, as \u201cIreland\u2019s Heritage Capital\u201d. Good local infrastructure means that most of Meath's tourist attractions are located within a one and a half hour drive from [[Dublin Airport]]. Despite this, Meath received just 162,000 overseas tourists in 2017 - placing it 17th out of 26 counties.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/life/travel/travel-news/revealed-the-irish-counties-most-and-least-visited-by-tourists-37236244.html|title=Revealed: The Irish counties most (and least) visited by tourists|work=The Irish Times}}</ref> Tourism is worth in excess of \u20ac50 million to the local economy each year.\n\nIn addition to historic attractions, Meath is home to scenic lakes, beaches, wooded areas and several European-designated areas of ecological significance. The only permanent amusement park in Ireland is [[Tayto Park]], located in Ashbourne, which has 3 roller-coasters, including ''C\u00fa Chulainn'', Ireland's largest roller-coaster.\n\nMeath also has a growing science and biotechnology field. In 2018, [[Shire (pharmaceutical company)|Shire]], one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies, opened a \u20ac350 million international disease research centre in Dunboyne, which employs 400 people.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.meathchronicle.ie/news/roundup/articles/2018/07/12/4158824-new-shire-plant-to-focus-on-treatment-of-rare-diseases/|title=New Shire plant to focus on treatment of rare diseases|work=Meath Chronicle}}</ref>\n\n===Agriculture===\n[[File:Silage Harvesting Cadamstown.jpg|thumb|right|[[Silage]] harvesting in [[Clonard, County Meath|Clonard]].]]\nThe agricultural products of the county are [[beef]], [[pork]], [[dairy]], [[poultry]], [[vegetables]] and [[cereals]]. Meath has a strong farming tradition and up until the [[Census of Ireland, 1911|1911 Census]] the most commonly listed occupation in the county was [[Farmworker|farm labourer]]. Meath is ranked 2nd in the country for the production of vegetables and 2nd for the production of [[Rapeseed|rapeseed oil]]. \n\nAs of 2018, Meath has the country's 8th largest cattle herd with 275,301 cows. Dairy production was the largest and most profitable agricultural sector in the county and 63.7% of all cattle were [[Dairy cattle|dairy cows]]. The remaining 36.3% were [[beef cattle]]. The county also has Ireland's 9th largest sheep herd (150,571 sheep) and 14th largest pig herd (40,259).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.agriculture.gov.ie/animalhealthwelfare/animalidentificationmovement/|title=eAnimal Identification & Movement|work=DAFM}}</ref> Meat processors such as Kepak and Dawn Meats are large employers within the county.\n \nThere are 4,620 farms in the county, with a total farmed area of {{convert|194886|ha|0|abbr=on}}, accounting for 83% of land area. Of this, {{convert|31201|ha|0|abbr=on}} was under tillage, the 3rd highest in the country. Although Irish agriculture is heavily dominated by [[pasture]] farming, Meath's favourable climate and easterly location gives it a much greater capacity than most counties for agricultural diversification, reflected in its robust tillage and vegetable production sectors. The average size of a farm in the county is {{convert|42|ha|0|abbr=on}}, well above the national average of {{convert|31|ha|0|abbr=on}}.  \n\nAgriculture supports thousands of jobs within the county and, according to the [[Irish Farmers' Association]], the total value of agricultural produce from Meath in 2018 was \u20ac541 million, ranking it 6th in Ireland.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ifa.ie/cross-sectors/economics/value-of-agriculture-2016/|title=The Value of Irish Agriculture|work=IFA}}</ref>\n\n===Extraction and Energy===\n[[File:Zinc fragment sublimed and 1cm3 cube.jpg|thumb|right|Meath is the largest producer of [[Zinc]] in [[Europe]].]]\nDue to the geology of the area, Meath has enormous reserves of [[Lead]] and [[Zinc]], which are extracted at [[Tara Mine]] in Navan. Tara is both Europe's largest and deepest mine, and is currently owned by [[Boliden AB]]. The mine has been in continuous operation since 1977, and a total of 85 million tonnes of ore have been extracted from it, producing 2.6 million tonnes of zinc ore annually.<ref>https://vp217.alertir.com/afw/files/press/boliden/201703089998-1.pdf</ref>\n\nGlacial deposits of gravel exist in a band stretching from the Offaly border at Edenderry, to the sea at Laytown. This is the basis of a long quarrying tradition. The local availability of large deposits of the limestone and shale also gave rise to a significant cement production industry within the county. The two largest cement facilities are at Kinnegad and Platin, the latter of which is owned by [[CRH plc|Irish Cement]] and has the capacity to produce 2.8 million tonnes of cement per annum, which is primarily transported via rail to Dublin for use or export.\n\nIreland's first waste-to-energy plant opened in Duleek in 2011 and produces 17 MW of electricity per annum.  [[SSE plc|SSE]] [[Airtricity]] aim to build a 208 MW gas-fired power plant south of Drogheda. Meath has a small but growing [[biomass]] industry, however other forms of renewable energy such as [[wind power]] and [[hydroelectricity]] have stalled due to widespread objections. There is an abundance of natural subterranean [[Fault (geology)|faults]] where water from [[hot spring|hot springs]], such as those Enfield,  rise to the surface at 25\u00b0C. There is potential for these to be used for [[Geothermal power|Shallow Geothermal Energy]] generation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meathppn.ie/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Renewable-Energy-Strategy-Proposal-2017.pdf|title=Renewable Energy Strategy for County Meath 2017|work=Meath Environmental Network}}</ref>\n\n==Infrastructure==\n===Road===\n[[File:The M1 Boyne Bridge, near Drogheda, Co. Louth - geograph.org.uk - 1414270.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The [[Mary McAleese Boyne Valley Bridge]]]]\nThe county is served by four [[Motorways in the Republic of Ireland|motorway routes]]. The [[N3 road (Ireland)|M3]] connects Navan to Dublin and runs from just south of Kells to Clonee, a distance of {{convert|48|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The [[N4 road (Ireland)|M4]] passes through the south of the county and serves as the main road to both [[Sligo]] and [[Galway]], when it divides at [[Kinnegad]] into the N4 and the [[M6 motorway (Ireland)|M6]]. The [[M1 motorway (Republic of Ireland)|M1]] Dublin to [[Belfast]] route traverses East Meath for {{convert|17|km|mi|abbr=on}} before bypassing [[Drogheda]]. \n\nA {{convert|13|km|mi|abbr=on}} stretch of the [[N2 road (Ireland)|N2]] from Ashbourne to the Dublin border at Ward Cross was upgraded to the M2 motorway in 2009. \nTwo [[National primary road|national primary routes]] pass through the county, The N3 and the N2. The M3 becomes the N3 south of Kells before continuing on to [[County Cavan]], a distance of {{convert|12|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The N2 begins at Ashbourne and crosses the county for roughly {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} before entering [[County Louth]] near [[Collon]].  Two [[National secondary road|national secondary routes]] pass through the county. The majority of the [[N51 road (Ireland)|N51]] Drogheda to Mullingar route is located within Meath, and crosses the county for {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}}, passing through Slane, Navan and Athboy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.meath.ie/council/council-services/planning-and-building/development-plans/county-development-plan|title=Meath County Development Plan|work=Meath County Council}}</ref> \n\nThe [[N52 road (Ireland)|N52]] which stretches from [[Nenagh]], where it joins the [[M7 motorway (Ireland)|M7]], to [[Dundalk]], where it joins the N1, crosses the county for {{convert|36|km|mi|abbr=on}} and passes through Kells. [[Bus \u00c9ireann]], as well as private coach operators, provide bus services to villages and towns across the county. Areas close to Dublin city in southern and eastern Meath such as Clonee and Dunboyne are also served by [[Dublin Bus]].\n\n===Rail===\n[[File:M3 Parkway railway station - 2014-05-15.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[M3 Parkway railway station]]]]\n[[Irish Rail]] provides frequent rail services from [[Dunboyne railway station|Dunboyne]] and [[M3 Parkway railway station|M3 Parkway]] to Dublin city centre. Laytown-Bettystown-Mornington as well as Gormanstown also have a commuter rail service and are located long Dublin's 'Northern Commuter Line' which runs from Dundalk to Dublin. A commuter train service (Western Commuter Line) passes through [[Enfield railway station (Ireland)|Enfield]], although the service is less frequent as the station is primarily used for the long-distance Irish rail routes to [[Longford]] and Sligo. \n\nNavan is currently served by a freight-only spur railway line from Drogheda the on the Dublin-Belfast main line, for freight traffic (zinc and lead concentrates from Tara Mines in Navan to Dublin Port) connecting at Drogheda. Currently, the only commuter rail from Dublin to Navan must also pass through Drogheda.  The direct [[Dublin\u2013Navan railway line]] remains disused, though still intact. In June 2018, the [[Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport|Department of Transport]] stated that it would review reopening the line by extending the link past the M3 parkway in 2021.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/question/2018-06-12/117/|title=Rail Network Expansion, Tuesday 12 June 2018|work=Oireachtas}}</ref> \n\n===Air===\nFor commercial and international flights, Meath is serviced by [[Dublin Airport]], which is the closest international airport to the county and has good road links with most major towns. For light aircraft and recreational flying, there are several airstrips located throughout the county which serve as the base of operations for local flying clubs. \n\nThe Trim Aerodrome is primarily used for microlight flying. The Ballybog Airstrip opened in 1990 and provides a number of recreational aviation activities such as [[hot air balloon]] rides and [[air show|air shows]]. There are also airfields at Navan and at Moyglare, across the river rye from [[Kilcock]], County Kildare. \n\nThere is also a military landing strip at [[Gormanstown Camp]] which is not actively used for aircraft. However, the [[Irish Defence Forces]] continue to utilise the airstrip for ground to air combat training.\n\n==Sport==\n===GAA===\n[[File:Croke Park fans on the hill.jpg|thumb|[[Meath GAA|Meath]] supporters (green and yellow) at an All-Ireland Qualifiers game against [[Tyrone GAA|Tyrone]].]]\n[[Gaelic football]] is the most popular sport in the county, and [[Meath GAA]] competes annually in Division 1 of the [[National Football League (Ireland)|National Football League]], the provincial [[Leinster Senior Football Championship]] and the [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]]. Meath has long been the second power of Leinster football, behind rivals [[Dublin GAA|Dublin]], and 26 Leinster Senior Football Championship Finals have been contested between the two, of which Meath emerged victorious on 9 occasions. In total, Meath has won 21 Leinster titles, making the county the second most successful in the province after Dublin.  Given the pre-eminence of Dublin in recent years, Meath's rivalry with [[Louth GAA|Louth]] is now often regarded as the most heated contest, especially after Meath's [[2010 Leinster Senior Football Championship Final|highly controversial win]] over Louth in the [[2010 Leinster Senior Football Championship|2010]] Leinster Final. \n\nMeath has won the national football league 7 times, between 1933 and 1994, the fifth most titles in Ireland. Additionally, Meath has won the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship, the most prestigious competition in Gaelic football, on 7 occasions between 1949 and 1999, also making it the fifth most successful county in Ireland. Meath has also won Leinster's [[O'Byrne Cup]] on 10 occasions, the second most after [[Kildare GAA|Kildare]].\n\nWithin the county, gaelic football clubs compete annually in the [[Meath Senior Football Championship]]. The first championship was played in 1887, in which Dowdstown beat Kells by 1 goal to nothing. The most successful club in Meath is [[Navan O'Mahonys GAA|Navan O'Mahonys]] with 20 Senior Football Championship titles. The most successful club at provincial level is [[Walterstown GFC|Walterstown]], which has won 2 [[Leinster Senior Club Football Championship]] titles in 1980 and 1983. No team from Meath has ever won the [[All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championship]].\n\nIn [[Hurling]], the county competes in Division 2 of the [[National Hurling League]], as well as in the [[Leinster Senior Hurling Championship]] and the [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship]]. Meath is not a [[Dual county|dual county]], and has never won a provincial or national hurling title.\n\nAs with football, the [[Meath Senior Hurling Championship]] is held every year. The first championship in 1902 was won by the [[Navan Hibernians GAC|Navan Hibernians]]. The most successful hurling club in the county is [[Kilmessan GAA|Kilmessan]], with 29 titles, followed by [[Trim GAA|Trim]], with 26. No club team from Meath has ever won the [[Leinster Senior Club Hurling Championship]], and have therefore never qualified for the [[All-Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championship]].\n[[File:Horse Racing at Fairyhouse.jpg|thumb|Horse racing at [[Fairyhouse Racecourse|Fairyhouse]].]]\n===Equestrian Activities===\nActivities such as [[Horse racing]], [[Horse breeding]] and [[Horse training]] are widely popular in Meath. There are 54 studs within the county, including the Dollanstown Stud and Estate, which is one of the most expensive private properties in Ireland. There are numerous race courses within the county, including [[Navan Racecourse|Navan]], [[Fairyhouse Racecourse|Fairyhouse]] and Bellewstown, which host both [[National Hunt racing|National]] Hunt and Flat horse races, such as the [[Brownstown Stakes]], the [[Bobbyjo Chase]], the [[Lismullen Hurdle]] and most notably, the [[Irish Grand National]], which has been held at Fairyhouse since 1870. Beach horse racing also takes place at Laytown.\n\nThe [[Tattersalls]] Country House and equestrian grounds, which hosts the International Horse Trials and Country Fair each year, is located opposite to the Fairyhouse Racecourse near Ratoath. \n\nArtist [[Letitia Marion Hamilton]] from Dunboyne won an Olympic Bronze Medal for [[Art competitions at the 1948 Summer Olympics|oils and watercolours]] in the [[1948 Summer Olympics]] for her depiction of [[List of Irish National Hunt races|The Meath Hunt Point-to-Point Races]].\n\n===Other sports===\n[[File:Killeen Castle 18th Hole.jpg|190px|thumb|18th Hole at Killeen Castle]]\nAs with much of the rest of Ireland, [[association football]] is a popular spectator sport within Meath. The two most prominent football clubs in the county are [[Parkvilla F.C.]] and [[Dunboyne A.F.C.]], which both compete in the [[Leinster Senior League (association football)|Leinster Senior League]]. The lower-tier Meath and District League comprises clubs from counties Meath, Louth, Cavan and Monaghan.  Despite being one of the most populous counties in Ireland, Dunboyne's [[Darragh Lenihan]] is the first and only player from Meath to have represented the [[Republic of Ireland national football team]], after making his debut in 2018.\n\nGolf is also widely played, and there are numerous golf and [[Links (golf)|links]] courses in Meath. [[Killeen Castle, Dunsany|Killeen Castle]] in Dunsany has an 18-hole championship golf course which was designed by [[Jack Nicklaus]] in 2009, and was the venue for the [[2011 Solheim Cup]]. Knightsbrook Golf Club in Trim also has a championship golf course which was designed by [[Christy O'Connor Snr|Christy O'Connor]] in 2006. The County Meath Golf Club in Trim and Royal Tara Golf Club near Navan are two of the most popular golfing locations in the county. Links golf is also played adjacent to the Irish sea coast at the Laytown & Bettystown Golf Club.\n\n[[Athletics (sport)|Athletics]] within the county is organised by the Meath Athletics Board, which overseas the county's 18 athletics clubs. The board is based in Claremont Stadium in Navan, which is a 400m Tartan Athletics Track and Field Stadium. [[Sara Treacy]] of Dunboyne AC represented Ireland in the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]].\n\nSeveral teams from Meath compete in the [[Leinster League]] in [[Rugby union]], most notably [[Ashbourne RFC]], [[Athboy RFC]], [[Navan R.F.C.]] and [[North Meath RFC]]. Former [[Leinster Rugby|Leinster]] and [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]] [[Wing (rugby union)|wing]] [[Shane Horgan]], from [[Bellewstown]], played for [[Boyne RFC]] in [[Drogheda]] at youth level.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Counties of Ireland]]\n*[[Lord Lieutenant of Meath]]\n*[[High Sheriff of Meath]]\n*[[Meath Archaeological and Historical Society]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n{{Wikivoyage}}\n\n*[http://www.meath.ie/ Meath County Council]\n*[http://www.meathtourism.ie/ Meath Tourism]\n\n{{Geographic Location\n|North = [[County Monaghan]]\n|South = [[County Kildare]] <!-- Commented out: [[File:KildareCrest.png|30px]] --><br>[[County Dublin]]\n|East = [[Irish Sea]] and [[County Dublin]]\n|West = [[County Westmeath]]\n|Northeast = [[County Louth]]<!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:Louth Co Co.png|32px]] -->\n|Northwest = [[County Cavan]] [[File:Cavan Coat of Arms.png|22px]]\n|Southwest = [[County Offaly]] [[File:Offaly crest.svg|30px]]\n|Centre = County Meath\n}}\n\n{{County Meath}}\n{{Ireland counties}}{{Authority control}}\n <!-- see [[WP:SUBCAT#Topic_article_rule]] -->\n\n{{Coord|53|40|N|6|40|W|region:IE_type:adm1st_source:GNS-enwiki|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:County Meath| ]]\n[[Category:Leinster|Meath]]\n[[Category:Counties of the Republic of Ireland|Meath]]\n[[Category:Local administrative units of the Republic of Ireland|Meath]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2015}}\n{{Use Irish English|date=July 2015}}\n{{short description|County in the Republic of Ireland}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n|name                   = County Meath\n|native_name            = {{Pad top italic|Contae na M\u00ed}}\n|native_name_lang       = gle\n|image_shield           = Meath coa.svg\n|nickname               = The Royal County\n|motto                  = ''Tr\u00e9 Neart le Ch\u00e9ile''{{spaces|2}}<small>([[Irish language|Irish]])</small><br/>\"Stronger Together\"\n|image_map              = Island of Ireland location map Meath.svg\n|image_flag             =\n|area_total_km2         = 2342\n|area_rank              = [[List of Irish counties by area|14th]]\n|seat_type              = [[County town]]\n|seat                   = [[Navan]]\n|blank_name_sec1        = [[Vehicle registration plates of Ireland|Vehicle index<br/>mark code]]\n|blank_info_sec1        = MH\n| established_title       = Established\n| established_date        = <br/>\n| established_title2       = [[Kingdom of Meath]]\n| established_date2        = [[Prehistoric Ireland|Antiquity]]\n|established_title3   = [[Lordship of Meath]]\n| established_date3=1172\n|established_title4   = Shired\n| established_date4=1297\n|established_title5   = [[Counties of Meath and Westmeath Act 1543|Division of Meath]]\n| established_date5=1542\n|population_total       = 195044\n|population_density_km2 = auto\n|population_rank        = [[List of Irish counties by population|8th]]\n|population_as_of       = 2016\n|population_footnotes   = <ref name=cso2016>{{cite web | url = http://census.cso.ie/sapmap2016/Results.aspx?Geog_Type=CTY31&Geog_Code=2AE19629149413A3E055000000000001 | title = Census 2016 Sapmap Area: County Meath | publisher = [[Central Statistics Office (Ireland)]] | accessdate = 12 January 2019}}</ref>\n|government_type        = [[Meath County Council|County Council]]\n|subdivision_type3      = D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann\n|subdivision_name3      = [[Meath East (D\u00e1il constituency)|Meath East]]<br>[[Meath West (D\u00e1il constituency)|Meath West]]<br>[[Louth (D\u00e1il constituency)|Louth]]\n|subdivision_type4      = EU Parliament\n|subdivision_name4      = [[Midlands\u2013North-West (European Parliament constituency)|Midlands\u2013North-West]]\n|subdivision_type       = [[Sovereign state|Country]]\n|subdivision_name       = [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]\n|subdivision_type1      = [[Provinces of Ireland|Province]]\n|subdivision_name1      = [[Leinster]]\n|unit_pref              = metric\n| elevation_max_m         =276 \n| elevation_max_point     =[[Slieve na Calliagh]]\n|website                = {{URL|www.meath.ie}}\n}}\n'''County Meath''' ({{IPAc-en|m|i\u02d0|\u00f0}}; {{lang-gle|Contae na M\u00ed}} or simply {{lang|ga|an Mh\u00ed}}) is a [[Counties of Ireland|county]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].

Other towns in the county include [[Trim, County Meath|Trim]], [[Kells, County Meath|Kells]], [[Laytown]], [[Ashbourne, County Meath|Ashbourne]], [[Dunboyne]], and [[Slane]].\n\nIt is one of only two counties outside the west of Ireland to have an official [[Gaeltacht]] (the other being [[County Waterford]], which has the Gaeltacht [[Ring, County Waterford|Ring]]) and the only county in Leinster to have an official Gaeltacht.\n\n==Geography and political subdivisions==\nMeath is the 14th-largest of Ireland's 32 counties by area, and the eighth-largest in terms of population.<ref>{{cite book |first=Eoghan |last=Corry |title=The GAA Book of Lists |publisher=Hodder Headline Ireland |year=2005 |id= |pages=186\u2013191 |isbn=0-340-89695-7}}</ref> It is the second-largest of Leinster's 12 counties in size, and the third-largest in terms of population. Meath borders seven counties - [[County Dublin|Dublin]] and [[County Louth|Louth]] to the east, [[Westmeath]] and [[Offaly]] to the west, [[County Kildare|Kildare]] to the south, and [[County Cavan|Cavan]] and [[County Monaghan|Monaghan]] to the north. Meath also has a {{convert|12|km|0|abbr=on}} coastline, which stretches along the [[Irish Sea]] between the [[River Boyne|Boyne]] and [[Delvin River|Delvin]] rivers, making it the second shortest coastline of any coastal county. The county town, Navan, is the largest settlement in Meath, and is situated on the River Boyne in the middle of the county.  Navan is approximately {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Dublin]] and {{convert|140|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Belfast]].\n\n===Physical Geography===\n[[File:The Burrows, Bettystown, Co. Meath - geograph.org.uk - 558986.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Irish Sea]] at [[Bettystown]].]]\n[[File:Br\u00fa na B\u00f3inne.jpg|thumb|right|The [[River Boyne]] at [[Br\u00fa na B\u00f3inne]].]]\nOwing to the fertile agricultural plains along the Boyne valley, which dominate the county, Meath's landscape is largely rural in nature. However, it is also one of the most densely populated counties in Ireland, with a population density of 83.2 people per km2. Centuries of exhaustive harvesting and reclamation for agriculture have severely reduced the extent of [[bogland]] in the county, especially in comparison to the neighbouring [[Midlands Region, Ireland|Midland]] counties. However, small areas of bogland survived, such as Jamestown Bog, Girley Bog and Killyconny Bog, and are currently protected as either [[List of Special Areas of Conservation in the Republic of Ireland|Special Areas of Conservation]] (SACs) or Natural Heritage Areas (NHAs).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npws.ie/protected-sites|title=Protected Sites in Ireland|work=NPWS}}</ref>\n\nThe River Boyne, at {{convert|112|km|mi|abbr=on}} in length, is Meath's dominant geographic feature and is synonymous with the county, having defined its history and culture over millennia. The two most prominent tributaries of the Boyne are the [[Leinster Blackwater]], which has its source in Cavan and flows south for {{convert|68|km|mi|abbr=on}} before joining the Boyne at Navan, and the [[Enfield Blackwater]], which has its source in Kildare and flows north for {{convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on}} before joining the Boyne at Donore. In the east of the county, both the [[Nanny (river)|River Nanny]] and the [[Delvin River]] flow to the Irish sea, with the latter demarcating the border with County Dublin.\n\nAs of 2017, there is a total of {{convert|13326|ha|0|abbr=on}} of forest cover in the county, representing 5.7% of total land area. This is an increase from just {{convert|11200|ha|0|abbr=on}} (4.8%) in 2006.  Nevertheless, Meath is Ireland's third-least forested county and remains well below the national average of 11% forest cover.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.agriculture.gov.ie/nfi/nfisecondcycle2012/|title=National Forestry Inventory, Second Cycle 2012|work=DAFM}}</ref> Historically, Meath was extensively forested, but experienced a near total deforestation between the 16th and 18th centuries. Although it has rebounded in recent years, the low of forest cover compared to other counties can be explained by the lack of a significant commercial forestry industry within the county. Meath is one of the smallest contributors to the national timber supply, and over two-thirds of Meath's forests are [[Broadleaf forest|broadleaf]] - the highest of any county - as opposed to more commercially viable [[conifers]]. Additionally, three-quarters of forests within the county are privately owned.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.agriculture.gov.ie/nfi/nfithirdcycle2017/nationalforestinventorypublications2017/|title=National Forestry Inventory, Third Cycle 2017|work=DAFM}}</ref>\n====Climate====\nUnder [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], Meath experiences a maritime [[temperate]] [[oceanic climate]] with cool winters, mild humid summers, and a lack of temperature extremes. [[Met \u00c9ireann]] records the climate data for Meath from their station at [[Dunsany, County Meath|Dunsany]], situation at {{convert|83|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level.  The average maximum January temperature is {{convert|7.3|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}, while the average maximum July temperature is {{convert|19.6|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. On average, the sunniest months are May and June, while the wettest month is October with {{convert|87|mm|0|abbr=on}} of rain, and the driest month is June with {{convert|67|mm|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.met.ie/climate/available-data/historical-data|title=Met Eireann, Historical Data|work=Met Eireann}}</ref> Humidity is high year round and rainfall is evenly distributed throughout the year. A number of [[Weather station|synoptic stations]] which record rainfall are located throughout the county. The driest parts of the county are in the east and south, while the wettest are in the west. [[Julianstown]] near the east coast receives {{convert|781|mm|0|abbr=on}} of rainfall per year, while [[Oldcastle, County Meath|Oldcastle]] in the west receives {{convert|1002|mm|0|abbr=on}}. The annual precipitation at Dunsany is {{convert|847|mm|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nSnow showers generally occur between November and March, but prolonged or heavy snow events are rare. Although frost is common in the central and western areas of the county, temperatures typically fall below 0\u00b0C (32\u00b0F) on just a few days per year. The lowest ever temperature in Meath was recorded in December 2010, at {{convert|-13.3|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.met.ie/cms/assets/uploads/2017/08/ColdSpell10.pdf|title=The Extreme Cold Spell of November-December 2010|work=Met Eireann}}</ref> Summer daytime temperatures range between {{convert|15|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|22|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}, with temperatures rarely going beyond {{convert|25|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. As with rainfall, the sunniest areas of the county are located along the coast. The climate gets progressively duller and wetter inland due to the convective development of clouds over land.\n\n===Geology===\n[[File:1-loughcrew3.jpg|thumb|right|230px|The [[Slieve na Calliagh]] hills]]\nThe county's geological landscape is predominantly made up of [[Lower Carboniferous]] [[limestone]], which underlies approximately 75% of the county. These were laid down following the erosion of mountain ranges which formed due to the closure of the [[Iapetus Ocean]]. The eroded mountains became basins in which limestone sediments and carbonate [[Mudstone|mud]] were deposited. The oldest rocks in the county are [[Ordovician]] in age and are found in thin layers near [[Slane]] and at [[Stamullen]], while the youngest rocks are of [[Paleogene]] age, and were formed as a result of volcanic activity. These are found in small [[Dike (geology)|dykes]] and [[Sill (geology)|sills]] throughout the county. [[Extensional tectonics|Crustal stretching]] beneath Ireland during the Carboniferous allowed fluids to infiltrate through faults in the rock, and extensive mineralisation occurred.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geoschol.com/counties/MEATH_GEOLOGY.pdf|title=Geology of County Meath|work=geoschol.com}}</ref> Most notably, zinc-bearing [[Sphalerite]] and lead-bearing [[Galena]] were deposited in vast quantities, giving Ireland the highest concentration of zinc per square kilometre on Earth.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://researchrepository.ucd.ie/bitstream/10197/9364/1/54_Hollis_et_al_2017_ICIW_Clumped_Conference.pdf|title=A comparison between clumped C-O and fluid inclusion temperatures for carbonates associated with Irish-type Zn-Pb orebodies|work=Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris}}</ref> The ubiquity of these minerals gave rise to the term \"[[Carbonate-hosted lead-zinc ore deposits|Irish-type]]\" lead-zinc deposits, which is a descriptive term for lead-zinc deposits hosted in carbonate rocks.<ref>{{Cite journal|journal=Applied Earth Science IMM Transactions Section B|volume=125|issue=2|date=2016|pages=75\u201376|doi=10.1080/03717453.2016.1166607|title=The Giant Navan carbonate-hosted Zn\u2013Pb deposit: exploration and geology: 1970\u20132015|first=John|last=Ashton|author2=Blakeman, Rob.}}</ref>\n\nMeath's landscape was shaped during the [[Last Glacial Period]], which ended 11,700 years ago. The soils of the county are mostly derived from [[glacial till]], consisting of a mix of clay, sand and gravel which were deposited by glacial melt-water. In the north of the county near the border with Cavan, a small series of [[Drumlin|drumlins]] were formed from [[Boulder clay|boulder clay]]. Loughs typically form in between the poorly-drained inter-drumlin areas, however unlike in neighbouring Cavan and Westmeath, Meath has no sizable loughs, other than [[Lough Sheelin]], on which the county shares a small coastline in its westernmost tip.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.teagasc.ie/media/website/environment/soil/Meath.pdf|title=Soils of County Meath|work=Teagasc}}</ref>\n\nMeath is largely flat and much of the county lies below {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea-level. The minor hills in the far west of the county at [[Loughcrew]], and in the north at Carrickleck are the only upland areas of any significance. [[Slieve na Calliagh]], at just {{convert|276|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height, is the highest point in the county, making it the second lowest [[List of Irish counties by highest point|county top]] in Ireland.

Between 1923 and 2007 a total of 31 [[Elections in the Republic of Ireland|General Elections]] and [[By-election|By-elections]] were held. Following the demise of [[Cumann na nGaedheal]] in the 1930s, national politics in the Meath and Meath-Westmeath constituencies was dominated by Fianna F\u00e1il, Fine Gael and Labour Party. During those years, the Meath and Meath-Westmeath constituencies returned a total of 106 [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TDs]] to [[D\u00e1il Eireann]], of which 54 were from Fianna F\u00e1il, 34 from Fine Gael and 11 from Labour; with Cumann na nGaedheal and the [[Farmers' Party (Ireland)|Farmers' Party]] returning 6 and 1 TDs respectively in the 1920s and 1930s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://electionsireland.org/index.cfm|title=Historic Election Results Database|publisher=electionsireland.org}}</ref> No other party would win a D\u00e1il seat in Meath until 2011, when Sinn F\u00e9in's [[Peadar T\u00f3ib\u00edn]] was elected to [[Meath West (D\u00e1il constituency)|Meath West]].\n\nCurrently, the county is divided across three D\u00e1il constituencies:\n*[[Meath West (D\u00e1il constituency)|Meath West]] - comprises the western portion of the county and includes a part of the neighbouring county of [[County Westmeath|Westmeath]];\n*[[Meath East (D\u00e1il constituency)|Meath East]] - lies entirely within the borders of the county;\n* [[Louth (D\u00e1il constituency)|Louth]] - comprises [[County Louth]] but also contains the electoral divisions of Julianstown and St. Marys (Part), which are collectively referred to as [[East Meath]]. \n\nMeath East and Meath West return 6 deputies to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann.

The ancient monuments of the Boyne Valley were assimilated into Celtic culture and mythology, with [[C\u00fa Chulainn]] said to have been conceived at Newgrange. Furthermore, tradition states that [[Sl\u00e1ine mac Dela]], of the [[Fir Bolg]], cleared the forest at Br\u00fa na B\u00f3inne and built the monuments, becoming the first High-King of Ireland. It was during the Celtic period that Meath was divided into 8 [[T\u00faath|t\u00faatha]], the primary political unit of [[Celtic Ireland]]. The t\u00faatha were independent [[petty kingdoms]] ruled by a chief who was elected by members of their extended family.\n\n===Early Christian Period (400-1169)===\n====Kingdom of Meath====\n{{Main|Kingdom of Meath|List of Kings of Meath|High King of Ireland}}\n[[File:Coat of arms of Meath.svg|thumb|140px|left|[[coat of arms of Mide|Coat of arms]] of the Kingdom of Meath]]\n[[File:Lia Fail.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Lia F\u00e1il]]'' (Stone of Destiny) at the [[Hill of Tara]] was the traditional inaugaration site of the [[High King of Ireland]].]] \nDue to a lack of extensive written historical records prior to the 5th century AD, the early history of Meath is murky and largely mythologised.

The feud was eventually resolved, and as part of the resolution it was decided that the position of King of Tara would alternate between the northern and southern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill septs. The title alternated between the two septs for over 500 years, with every second king traveling south from Ulster for an inauguration ceremony at Tara.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Simms|first1=Katharine|title=From Kings to Warlords: The Changing Political Structure of Gaelic Ireland in the Later Middle Ages|date=2000|publisher=Boydell Press|page=11}}</ref> By 740, [[Domnall Midi]] of the [[Clann Cholm\u00e1in]] dynasty, the most powerful branch of the southern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill, had conquered or subdued all neighboring clans in Meath, and the U\u00ed N\u00e9ill were recognised as their [[suzerain]]. Domnall was now in possession of both Tara, the seat of the U\u00ed N\u00e9ill, and the [[Hill of Uisneach]], which held symbolic significance as the [[geographical centre of Ireland]].

The ascendancy of this longtime rival kingdom posed a serious threat to High King [[M\u00e1el Sechnaill mac Domnaill]], so the two leaders met at [[Clonfert]] in 997 and agreed upon a truce, whereby Boru was granted overlordship of the southern half of the island. The [[Kingdom of Leinster]] immediately rebelled against Boru and allied with the Norse [[Kingdom of Dublin]]. Mide and Munster formed a defensive alliance and, after a series of campaigns throughout 998-999, crushed the forces of Leinster and Dublin, which both became [[Vassal state|vassals]] of Munster. \n\nBoru now believed that Munster was the most powerful kingdom in Ireland and therefore he, and not M\u00e1el Sechnaill, should be High-King. M\u00e1el Sechnaill's claim to the kingship was challenged by Boru in 1002 at the Hill of Tara. The Meath king requested a month-long truce to rally his subordinates to his side, which Boru accepted, however M\u00e1el Sechnaill was quickly abandoned by his northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill kinsmen. Having failed to raise enough troops to challenge Boru, he was forced to abdicate, thus ending the hereditary right of the U\u00ed N\u00e9ill to the title of High King. Although they remained Kings of Meath, the power and prestige of the southern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill would never recover.<ref>Donnchadh O Corrain, ''Ireland before the Normans'' (Dublin: Gill and Macmillan, 1972)</ref>\n\n====Monastic Settlement====\n{{See also|Hiberno-Scottish mission}} \nTraditional accounts of the arrival of [[Saint Patrick]] and [[Christianity]] to Ireland are centered on Meath and its legendary High Kings.

Patrick was then summoned to the king\u2019s court and so impressed L\u00f3egaire with his teachings that he was allowed to continue preaching Christianity across Ireland. While Christian missionaries were documented in Ireland long before the time of Saint Patrick, and accounts of his activities are heavily shrouded in myth, what is known is that by the late 6th century AD Christianity had supplanted [[Ancient Celtic religion|Celtic Paganism]] in every corner of the island.<ref>{{cite book|title = The Life and Acts of Saint Patrick: The Archbishop, Primate and Apostle of Ireland | publisher = Hibernia Press Company | author = Edmund Lenthal Swifte | date = 1809 | url = https://archive.org/details/lifeandactssain00jocegoog | via = Archive.org }}</ref> In a similar manner to how the Celts assimilated prehistoric traditions into their beliefs, many Celtic pagan beliefs and festivities were adapted to [[Celtic Christianity]], such as [[Samhain]], which became [[Halloween]], and [[Imbolc]], which became St. Brigid's Day.\n\nBy the 7th century a network of monasteries and religious settlements had been set up throughout Ireland and [[D\u00e1l Riata|Western Scotland]], supported by local kings and chieftains. Beginning at this time, the \"''Golden Age of Irish Christianity''\" lasted for several centuries. Irish Scholars preserved invaluable [[Classical Latin|Latin texts]] and Gaelic monasteries developed into centres of learning which attracted theologians from across Europe. These monasteries sent missionaries to northern and central Europe to re-ignite Christianity and Latin tradition in areas where it had lapsed following the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. One of Ireland's national nicknames, \"''the land of saints and scholars''\", is in reference to this period. \n\nPatronage of the Church was also used as a political tool to project wealth and prestige in Irish kingdoms until the 16th century. Successive High Kings and Kings of Meath supported the establishment of prominent religious settlements and institutions, such as [[Abbey of Kells|Kells]] and [[Clonard Abbey]], the latter of which taught Ireland's most significant saints, dubbed the [[Twelve Apostles of Ireland]]. During the golden age, the monasteries of Meath produced several of Ireland's most famous artifacts, which are considered to be among the finest examples of [[Insular art|Insular]] and medieval [[Christian art]] in existence.<ref>O'Donovan, John. \"[http://www.ucc.ie/celt/online/G102003.html The Irish Charters in the Book of Kells]\".

The most distinctive feature of Irish monasteries, their [[Irish round tower|round towers]], were built in response to these Viking raids. Eventually, the Vikings established kingdoms and founded [[History of Ireland (800\u20131169)#Second Viking age (914\u2013980)|Ireland\u2019s first cities]] along coastal areas, including in neighboring [[Dublin]]. The High Kings and lesser kingdoms waged near-continuous war with these [[Norse-Gael]] settlers for over two centuries.\n\n===Lordship of Ireland (1169-1542)===\n====Norman Period====\n{{Main|Lordship of Meath}}\n[[File:Trim Castle 6.jpg|thumb|[[Trim Castle]], the largest Norman castle in Ireland]]\nIn 1166, [[Diarmait Mac Murchada]] was banished from Ireland by the High King [[Ruaidr\u00ed Ua Conchobair]] for the abduction of Lady of Meath [[Derbforgaill ingen Maeleachlainn]], wife of [[Tigern\u00e1n Ua Ruairc]], King of [[Breifne]]. Mac Murchada returned with Norman allies and landed at Bannow in [[County Wexford|Wexford]] in 1169, after which they conquered northward throughout 1169-70, initiating the [[Norman Invasion of Ireland]]. In response, the High King assembled an alliance which included King Magnus Ua M\u00e1el Sechlainn of Meath as well as soldiers from [[Connacht]], Breifne and [[Kingdom of Dublin|Dublin]] along with their respective kings. They confronted Mac Murchada's forces at [[Ferns, County Wexford|Ferns]] and an agreement was reached whereby Mac Murchada was acknowledged as king of Leinster, in return for acknowledging Ruaidr\u00ed as his overlord and agreeing to send his foreign allies away permanently.<ref>''A. J. Otway-Ruthven'', \"A History of Medieval Ireland\", 1968, p45.</ref> However, Mac Murchada breached the agreement and enlisted more Normans to his side before continuing his conquests, capturing [[Dublin]] in 1171 and forcing the capitulation of Magnus Ua M\u00e1el Sechlainn. \n[[File:Hugh de Lacy.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Hugh de Lacy, Lord of Meath|Hugh de Lacy]], 1st Lord of Meath]]\n[[File:The Pale According to the Statute of 1488 edit.jpg|thumb|[[The Pale]] \u2013 According to Statute of 1488]]\nFollowing Mac Murchada's death in May 1171, [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Strongbow]] succeeded him as [[King of Leinster]] and, once again, Magnus joined the High-King's coalition army to oust the Normans, however their forces were routed during an unsuccessful siege of Dublin. Fearing that Strongbow was growing too powerful and might set up his own independent kingdom in Ireland, [[Henry II of England]] landed in Ireland in October 1171 to establish control over both the Irish and the Normans. Henry's campaign in Ireland was largely successfully and he managed to reign in the Normans as well as a few Irish kingdoms which also submitted to him. Most crucially, he retained the city of Dublin, and [[Hugh de Lacy, Lord of Meath|Baron Hugh de Lacy]] was made its bailiff.{{sfn|Kingsford|1892}} Henry's appointment of de Lacy was intended to act as a counterbalance to Strongbow. However in order to achieve this, de Lacy would need a strong holding on Irish soil and it was decided that the Kingdom of Meath was to be granted to de Lacy.\n\nThis grant posed an issue for Henry as the previous decade had been a tumultuous time in Meath. There were four rival heirs to the kingship and each claimant held a different part of the kingdom. The strongest claim came from the King of Breifne, [[Tigern\u00e1n Ua Ruairc]], who - through conquest, marriage and an alliance with the church - had subsumed almost all of eastern Meath into his kingdom by the time of the Norman arrival.<ref>[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~ruairc/ocastle.htm Ancestry.com \u2013 Kingdom of Br\u00e9ifne]</ref> Strongbow also had nominal claim to Meath as King of Leinster. A war of succession within the [[Clann Cholm\u00e1in]] dynasty meant that both Magnus and Art Ua M\u00e1el Sechlainn were also vying for the kingship of Meath. To circumvent this problem, Henry defined the borders of Meath as they had been in [[1153 in Ireland|1153]] and ignored all subsequent subdivisions. In March 1172 he granted control of Meath to de Lacy on the condition that de Lacy could personally retain the kingdom with near total autonomy, if he could conquer it.\n\nShortly after Henry left Ireland, Hugh de Lacy invaded Meath, setting up countless [[motte and bailey]] fortifications throughout the kingdom. de Lacy made the ecclesiastic centre of Trim his stronghold, constructing a huge ringwork castle defended by a stout double palisade and external ditch on top of the hill. With de Lacy now at the border of Ua Ruairc's outermost settlement of Kells, a parlay was arranged and the two leaders met on the [[Hill of Ward]] for negotiations. During these negotiations, a dispute erupted and de Lacy's men killed Ua Ruairc. Both sides blamed the other, with the [[Irish annals]] reporting that Ua Ruairc was \"''treacherously slain''\".<ref name=martin99>Martin (2008), p.99</ref>\n\nBy 1175, de Lacy had conquered the entire territory, executing Magnus Ua M\u00e1el Sechlainn that year. He expanded existing settlements into charter towns throughout Meath, including Trim, Athboy, Kells and Navan; and he married [[Rose N\u00ed Conchobair]], the High-King's daughter, in order to cement his claim as Lord of Meath.\n\nHugh de Lacy died in 1186 and several informal divisions and feuds among de Lacy\u2019s descendants over control of the lordship followed over the next century. The Lordship was formally shired in 1297 into the County of Meath.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.historyireland.com/early-modern-history-1500-1700/geographical-loyalty-counties-palatinates-boroughs-and-ridings/|title='Geographical loyalty'?

Firstly, there was a reconsolidation and resurgence in the power of the Irish kingdoms which had been shattered during the Norman invasion. Secondly, the onset of the [[Black Death]] devastated nucleated settlements such as walled Anglo-Norman towns, but had a significantly smaller impact in more sparsely populated Gaelic kingdoms. Lastly, and of most concern to the English crown, the gradual [[More Irish than the Irish themselves|gaelicisation of the Normans]] meant that many of the most prominent Anglo-Norman families, who were meant to act as England's [[Viceroy|viceroys]] in Ireland, no longer followed English laws or customs.<ref>The introduction to the text of the Statutes of Kilkenny, 1366, (pp.4\u20137)</ref> \n\nEnglish authority continued to retreat eastward until Trim, Athboy and Kells were the outermost settlements of [[The Pale]], an area centered around [[Dublin]] where English law was still obeyed. This situation meant that by the 1500s part of County Meath was within the Pale while other areas - which were inhabited by both the Gaelic Irish as well as Normans who were once loyal to the Crown - were now outside the control of the authorities in Dublin.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=Steven G.|title=Defending English Ground: War and Peace in Meath and Northumberland, 1460\u20131542 |url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=oxcaCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA62 |pages=62\u201364 |accessdate=2015-06-24|date=2015-05-07|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199696291}}</ref>\n\n===Kingdom of Ireland (1542-1800)===\n====Tudor Conquest====\n{{Main|Tudor conquest of Ireland}}\n[[File:Dunmoe Castle - geograph.org.uk - 290230.jpg|thumb|Tudor-era [[Dunmoe Castle]]]]\nThe [[papal bull]] ''[[Laudabiliter]]'' of [[Pope Adrian IV]], issued in 1155, recognised the [[House of Plantagenet|Angevin]] monarch as ''Dominus Hibernae'' (Latin for \"Lord of Ireland\"). When [[Pope Clement VII]] excommunicated [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] in 1533, the constitutional position of the lordship in Ireland became uncertain. Following Henry's split with the church, the [[Tudors]] heralded the end of monastic Meath. Church Lands which comprised roughly one third of the county were seized and granted to [[Protestant]] English statesmen and soldiers as a form of payment. Monasteries were suppressed and their treasures were either looted or scattered by Irish scholars to protect them. \n<ref>The introduction to the text of the Statutes of Kilkenny, 1366, (pp.4\u20137)</ref>\nMeath was invaded by [[T\u00edr Eoghain|Tyrone]] and its allies in 1539 who raided as far south as Navan, which was razed to the ground.

For this reason, and also to address England's waning power in Ireland, Henry proclaimed the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] in 1542, with himself as its monarch. The following year, the [[Counties of Meath and Westmeath Act 1543|Counties of Meath and Westmeath Act]] was passed by the [[Parliament of Ireland]] and Meath was officially divided in two. The act was intended to allow a more effective administration in both counties, particularly in Westmeath, which England had lost control of. A new shire town at [[Mullingar]] was established along with four new [[Barony (Ireland)|baronies]], while Trim retained its status as the shire town of Meath.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://books.google.com/?id=HXhaAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA232#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Statutes at Large: From the third year of Edward the Second, A.D. 1310 to the fifth year of George the Third, A.D. 1761 inclusive|year=1765}}</ref>\n\nDespite the general loyalty of the \"[[Normans in Ireland#\"Old English\" vs. New English|Old English]]\" of Meath to the government in Dublin, the introduction of new [[Anglican]] English settlers, seen as more reliable by the English government, undermined the power of the Anglo-Norman aristocracy who had remained overwhelmingly Catholic following the [[Reformation]]. Although there was fervent anti-Catholic sentiment in England at this time, no punitive laws were enacted out of fear that they would provoke further rebellion. However, this changed following England\u2019s victory over the Irish kingdoms in the [[Nine Years' War (Ireland)|Nine Years' War]] in 1603. With Ireland subdued, the English pursued a series of [[Penal Laws]] restricting the rights of Catholics, which were accelerated following the [[Gunpowder Plot]] of 1605.\n\n====Protestant Ascendancy====\n[[File:MANTE(1800) p3.072 CROMWELL TAKING DROGHEDA - 1649.jpg|thumb|[[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]] shelling [[Drogheda]] from across the Boyne, 1649]]\n[[File:BattleOfBoyne.gif|thumb|[[Battle of the Boyne]], 1690]]\nThe uneasy peace that had persisted between Catholics and Protestants for several decades unraveled when the anti-Catholic [[Long Parliament]] gained traction in England in 1640.

Sir John Read was sent to deliver it; however, gripped by anti-Catholic hysteria, officials in Dublin seized Read and tortured him, questioning whether the King and his Catholic wife [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta]] were in league with the Irish rebels.\n\nAs the rebellion intensified, the Ulstermen once again conquered southward into Meath, crushing an English garrison at the [[Battle of Julianstown]]. A contingent of Old English lords led by [[Viscount Gormanston]] rode out to halt their advance. A parlay was arranged at the Hill of Crufty and the Irish, led by [[Rory O'Moore|O'Moore]] and [[Philip O'Reilly|O'Reilly]], met with the Anglo-Norman gentry of Meath.

After the outbreak of the [[English Civil War]], an assembly was held in [[Kilkenny]] and the provisional government of [[Confederate Ireland]] was established, which took up arms with the [[Cavalier|Royalists]] against the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]].

Former aristocratic families were forced to send their children abroad for education to Irish seminaries in [[Kingdom of France|France]] and the [[Spanish Netherlands]]. The \"New English\" along with those who had converted to Anglicanism occupied the Parliament, becoming what would later be termed the [[Protestant Ascendancy]]. This period also saw an influx of [[Huguenots]] into Meath, and surnames such as Beaufort and Metge appeared in the county for the first time.\n\nSome Old English families were able to recover their lands and return to Meath following the restoration of [[James II of England|King James II]]. Although James did little to improve the overall situation of Irish Catholics, he was backed by them during the [[Glorious Revolution]], while Protestants overwhelmingly backed [[William III of England|William of Orange]] during the [[Williamite War in Ireland]]. The defeat of the [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]] at the [[Battle of the Boyne]] in July 1690 forced James to flee to France, ending the prospect of an autonomous Irish kingdom. This battle is seen as a seminal event in Irish history and is still [[The Twelfth|celebrated]] every year by [[Unionism in Ireland|Ulster Unionists]].\n\nTowards the end of the 18th century the Penal Laws were relaxed and Catholic merchant families such as [[Fay (surname)|Fay]] and [[Connolly (surname)|Connolly]] were granted trading privileges in Trim and Navan.

Ireland briefly secured parliamentary independence through the [[Constitution of 1782]] which ushered in Ireland's first economic boom in centuries, as trade flourished and the population grew exponentially. However, these freedoms were abruptly ended with the [[Act of Union 1800]], when Ireland was subsumed into the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]].\n\n===19th Century===\n[[File:Thomas-Brennan-Land-League.jpg|thumbnail|190px|[[Thomas Brennan (Irish Land League)|Thomas Brennan]], co-founder of the [[Irish National Land League]] in 1879.]]\nThe economic boom of the late 18th century came to a sudden and catastrophic halt following the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1815. During the war, Ireland had become known as the \"''Food larder of Europe''\", and the tenant farmers and landlords of Meath relied heavily on [[tillage]], which fetched an artificially high price due to a surge in wartime demand. Further, a substantial number of Irish soldiers who comprised as much as 25% of the entire [[British Army]] and [[Royal Navy|Navy]] during the war were now made redundant. As post-war trade between Britain and Europe recovered, demand for Irish tillage collapsed; however, rents remained the same and the population continued to boom. As economic stagnation set in, the once well-managed, prosperous estates of Meath gave way to mismanagement and [[Absentee landlord|absenteeism]], and the tenant farmers were pushed further into poverty.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Social Conditions in Ireland during the Napoleonic Wars|volume = 5|issue = 18|pages = 210\u2013225|work=jstor|jstor = 25700989|last1 = Cahalane|first1 = P.|year = 1916|publisher = Irish Province of the Society of Jesus}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|chapter=Ireland during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, 1791\u20131815|work=cambridge.org|doi=10.1017/9781316335680.006|title=The Cambridge History of Ireland|pages=74\u2013101|year=2018|last1=Bartlett|first1=Thomas|isbn=9781316335680}}</ref>\n\nThis dire economic state resulted in a surge of [[Irish nationalism]] and demands to repeal the disastrous Act of Union. Nationalist sentiment was widespread in Meath, as reflected in the [[Meath (UK Parliament constituency)|Meath Parliamentary constituency]], which returned several of 19th century Ireland's most prominent nationalist politicians, including [[Daniel O'Connell]], [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] and [[Michael Davitt]]. Owing to its symbolic place in the national psyche, Daniel O'Connell held a rally on the [[Hill of Tara]] in August 1843 which was attended by between 500,000 and 1 million people, making it one of the largest crowd gatherings in Irish history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navanhistory.ie/index.php?page=o-connell-at-tara|title=O'Connell at Tara|work=Navan Historical Society}}</ref> \n\nTo address rising poverty and growing unrest in Ireland, the British government set up [[Workhouse|workhouses]] in the 1830s and began constructing [[Rail transport in Ireland|railroads]]. However, these efforts were largely unsuccessful and the impoverished of Meath, pushed to brink by high rents and mass unemployment, were wiped out by the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] of 1845-49. Having reached over 183,000 in 1841, the population of Meath would fall to 67,000 by 1900. The famine had a lasting cultural, societal and linguistic effect on the county. Pre-famine census records show that Meath had been a region with an \"''undoubted Irish speaking majority''\"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wia5nginsawC|title=Rebuilding the Celtic Languages|work=Diarmuid O'N\u00e9ill|isbn=9780862437237|last1=O'N\u00e9ill|first1=Diarmuid|year=2005}}</ref>, but by the late 1800s the [[Irish language]] was virtually extinct within the county. The famine-era workhouse and mass grave at Dunshaughlin is today a memorial to its victims. \n\nThe famine shed light on the detrimental effects that Ireland's land laws were having on the economic and social well-being of the country, and the British government's lacklustre response to the crisis further strengthened the cause of Irish nationalists. The Protestant Ascendancy went into steep decline following the famine and many landholders were effectively bankrupt, leading to the [[ad hoc]] sale of lands into unproductive use. The push for reform escalated in the 1870s into a period of sporadic violence and civil unrest known as the [[Land War]]s.\n\n[[Thomas Brennan (Irish Land League)|Thomas Brennan]], of [[Yellow Furze]], co-founded the  [[Irish National Land League]] in 1879 alongside Michael Davitt. His staunch [[Irish republicanism|republicanism]] and socialist leanings put him at odds with the League's executive, and he was excluded from the [[Irish National League]] set up by Parnell in 1882. Brennan moved to the [[United States]] and raised money for the republican cause, advocating total Irish independence as opposed to [[Home Rule]] to the [[Irish-American]] diaspora.<ref>[http://www.astonisher.com/archives/mjb/irishlit/irishlit_ch16.html Malcolm Brown, ''The Politics of Irish Literature''. Chapter 16]</ref> This revealed an ideological divide within the nationalist movement, between those who favoured greater  legislative independence under the British crown, as had been achieved in the 1780s, and those who advocated for completely severing ties with the United Kingdom. \n\nSome of the political reforms desired by the nationalists were finally realised under the [[Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898|Local Government Act of 1898]]. The act set up urban and rural districts as well as county councils to take over local government from landlords. Under the reforms, small sub-councils and boroughs were abolished and [[Meath County Council]] was granted full control over the jurisdiction. The council sat at Navan, which became the new [[county town]] of Meath, ending Trim's 600-year status as Meath's shire town.<ref name=beckett>{{cite book |title=The Making of Modern Ireland 1603 \u2013 1923 |last=Beckett |first=J C |year=1966 |publisher=Faber & Faber |location=London |isbn=0-571-09267-5 |page=406 }}</ref><ref name=gailey>{{cite journal |last1=Gailey |first1=Andrew |date=May 1984 |title=Unionist Rhetoric and Irish Local Government Reform, 1895-9 |journal=Irish Historic Studies |volume=24 |issue=93 |pages=52\u201368 |jstor=30008026 |doi= 10.1017/S0021121400034027}}</ref>\n\n===20th Century===\n[[File:Fireworks at the First Tailteann Games August 15, 1924.jpg|thumb|First modern revival of Ancient Meath's [[Tailteann Games (ancient)|Tailteann Games]], 1924]]\nThe reforms proposed by the UK government failed to stem the rising tide of nationalism, which spilled over into the 20th century as the [[1916 Easter Rising]]. The Battle of Ashbourne was one of the few skirmishes which took place outside of Dublin during the rising, and was its sole success. On 28 April 1916, members of the [[Irish Volunteers|Dublin Volunteers]] Fifth ([[Fingal]]) battalion, led by [[Thomas Ashe]], surrounded a [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] (RIC) police station in [[Ashbourne, County Meath|Ashbourne]] and demanded their surrender. RIC reinforcements were dispatched from Navan and upon arriving at the scene a firefight ensued during which 8 RIC members were killed and 15 wounded, forcing them to retreat. On the orders of [[Patrick Pearse]], Ashe and his battalion surrendered the following day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meathchronicle.ie/news/1916centenary/articles/2016/05/05/4119283-the-1916-series-the-battle-of-ashbourne/|title=The 1916 Series: The Battle of Ashbourne|work=Meath Chronicle}}</ref>\n\nMeath's [[Eamonn Duggan]] served as the [[Irish Republican Army (1919\u20131922)|IRA's]] director of intelligence during and after the rising, and was a signatory of the [[Anglo-Irish treaty]] in 1921. Meath largely sided with the pro-treaty forces during the [[Irish Civil War|Civil War]], with the [[Louth\u2013Meath (D\u00e1il constituency)|Louth\u2013Meath constituency]] returning one anti-treaty and four pro-treaty [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TDs]] in the [[1922 Irish general election|1922 general election]]. Duggan later joined [[Cumann na nGaedheal]] and held various ministerial offices until his death in 1936. Following independence, various government-backed [[Gaelic revival]] efforts were centered on the county and its history, including the foundation of 5 [[Gaeltacht]] areas within Meath, and the symbolic hosting of the [[Tailteann Games (ancient)|Tailteann Games]]. \n\nThe declining population of Meath gradually stabilised as emigration balanced with high natural birth rates. Outward migration from the county remained substantial until the reforms of [[Sean Lemass]] in the 1960s strengthened industry by injecting capital into the economy and abandoning the policy of [[autarky]].<ref>Garvin T. ''Preventing the Future'' (Dublin 2004) pp.45\u201346. {{ISBN|0-7171-3771-6}}</ref> These reforms, coupled with [[EEC]] membership in 1973, brought jobs and investment into the county, and the extraction and textile industries prospered. By the 1971 census Meath's population had surpassed 70,000 for the first time in eighty years. Despite a [[Economic history of the Republic of Ireland#1980 to early 1990s|severe recession]] in the 1980s, the growth of Meath's economy and population became exponential in the late 1990s and early 2000s during the [[Celtic Tiger]] era. \n\nAs places such as Trim, Navan and Kells developed into major commuter towns of Dublin, the county grew increasingly reliant on the [[Overheating (economics)|overheated]] construction sector, leaving Meath hard-hit by the [[Irish property bubble|property collapse]] in [[Post-2008 Irish banking crisis|2008]].

This increase was mainly due to a baby boom locally. The population then continued to increase at a constant rate, before increasing at an explosive rate between 1996 and 2002, from 109,732 to 134,005. This is due primarily to economic factors, with the return of residents to live in the county, and also an echo effect of the 1970s baby boom.

It is also the [[List of urban areas in the Republic of Ireland by population|5th largest town]] in the state, excluding [[City status in Ireland|cities]]. \n\nMeath is predominantly an urban county, although a large percentage of its residents live in rural areas. According to the 2016 Census, 58.9 percent of the county lived in urban areas, and the remaining 41.1 percent lived in rural areas. Just over half of the county's population (51.3 percent) live in the ten largest towns. Historically, the largest towns in Meath were located in the north and west of the county, such as Trim, Navan and Kells. However, in recent years settlements in the south and east of the county such as Ashbourne, Dunboyne and [[Bettystown]] have expanded significantly, and many of the county's largest and fastest growing towns are now located in these areas.\n{{Largest cities\n| name         = Largest towns\n| country      = Meath (Census 2016)\n| stat_ref     = Source:<ref name=largest>{{cite web |url=https://www.cso.ie/en/ |title=CSO|date= |website= |publisher=Central Statistics Office |accessdate= June 8, 2019}}</ref>\n| list_by_pop  =\n| class        = nav\n| div_name     =\n| div_link     = D\u00e1il constituencies{{!}}Constituency\n| city_1 = Navan\n| div_1 = Meath West (D\u00e1il constituency){{!}}Meath West\n| pop_1 = 30,173\n| img_1 = MarketSquareNavan.JPG\n| city_2 = Ashbourne, County Meath{{!}}Ashbourne\n| div_2 = Meath East (D\u00e1il constituency){{!}}Meath East\n| pop_2 = 12,679 \n| img_2 = New Shopping District Ashbourne 2006-4-30.jpg\n| city_3 = Laytown-Bettystown-Mornington\n| div_3 = Louth (D\u00e1il constituency){{!}}Louth\n| pop_3 = 11,872 \n| img_3 = Neptune Hotel, Bettystown.jpg\n| city_4 = Ratoath\n| div_4 = Meath East (D\u00e1il constituency){{!}}Meath East\n| pop_4 = 9,533 \n| img_4 = Ratoath - Holy Trinity church.jpg\n| city_5 = Trim, County Meath{{!}}Trim\n| div_5 = Meath West (D\u00e1il constituency){{!}}Meath West\n| pop_5 = 9,194 \n| img_5 = Jackson_County_Courthouse_Independence_MO-cropped.jpg\n| city_6 = Dunboyne\n| div_6 = Meath East (D\u00e1il constituency){{!}}Meath East\n| pop_6 = 7,272 \n| img_6 =\n| city_7 =Kells, County Meath{{!}}Kells\n| div_7 = Meath West (D\u00e1il constituency){{!}}Meath West\n| pop_7 = 6,135\n| img_7 =\n| city_8 = Drogheda{{!}}Drogheda (Southern Environs)\n| div_8 = Louth (D\u00e1il constituency){{!}}Louth\n| pop_8 = 5,000\n| img_8 =\n| city_9 = Duleek\n| div_9 = Meath East (D\u00e1il constituency){{!}}Meath East\n| pop_9 = 4,219\n| img_9 =\n| city_10 = Dunshaughlin\n| div_10 = Meath East (D\u00e1il constituency){{!}}Meath East\n| pop_10 = 4,035\n| img_10 =\n}}\n\n==Economy==\nThe [[Central Statistics Office (Ireland)|Central Statistics Office]] estimates that Meath\u2019s Total Household Income in 2017 was \u20ac5.253 billion, ranking 6th among Irish counties. Meath also ranks 6th in the country by per capita disposable income, at \u20ac20,493 or 95.8% of the State average.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/er/cirgdp/countyincomesandregionalgdp2016/|title=County Incomes and Regional GDP|work=CSO}}</ref> Meath residents are also the 6th highest per capita tax contributors to the State, returning a total of \u20ac1.311 billion in taxes in 2017 \u2013 roughly equivalent to the entire [[Midlands Region, Ireland|Midlands Region]]. Major industries include services, retail, agriculture and food processing, mining, manufacturing and tourism.\n\n===Services, Retail and Hospitality===\n[[File:C\u00fa Chulainn Coaster Arial View.jpg|thumb|''[[The C\u00fa Chulainn Coaster|C\u00fa Chulainn]]'', Ireland's biggest rollercoaster.]]\nServices, retail and the hospitality industry are the primary employers in the county. Navan was historically a manufacturing town, and involved in the household goods sector. Navan was also a centre in the Irish carpet-making industry, before this was lost to overseas competition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.navanhistory.ie/index.php?page=navan-carpets|title=Navan Historical Society - Navan Carpets |website=www.navanhistory.ie |accessdate=2 May 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171119162310/http://www.navanhistory.ie/index.php?page=navan-carpets |archivedate=19 November 2017 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nTourism benefits from the abundance of historically important pre-historic and early Christian sites, as well as castles and manor houses within the county, many of which are in currently in use as hotels. Due to its rich history, Meath is marketed by [[F\u00e1ilte Ireland]], the country\u2019s national tourism agency, as \u201cIreland\u2019s Heritage Capital\u201d. Good local infrastructure means that most of Meath's tourist attractions are located within a one and a half hour drive from [[Dublin Airport]]. Despite this, Meath received just 162,000 overseas tourists in 2017 - placing it 17th out of 26 counties.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/life/travel/travel-news/revealed-the-irish-counties-most-and-least-visited-by-tourists-37236244.html|title=Revealed: The Irish counties most (and least) visited by tourists|work=The Irish Times}}</ref> Tourism is worth in excess of \u20ac50 million to the local economy each year.\n\nIn addition to historic attractions, Meath is home to scenic lakes, beaches, wooded areas and several European-designated areas of ecological significance. The only permanent amusement park in Ireland is [[Tayto Park]], located in Ashbourne, which has 3 roller-coasters, including ''C\u00fa Chulainn'', Ireland's largest roller-coaster.\n\nMeath also has a growing science and biotechnology field. In 2018, [[Shire (pharmaceutical company)|Shire]], one of the world\u2019s largest pharmaceutical companies, opened a \u20ac350 million international disease research centre in Dunboyne, which employs 400 people.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.meathchronicle.ie/news/roundup/articles/2018/07/12/4158824-new-shire-plant-to-focus-on-treatment-of-rare-diseases/|title=New Shire plant to focus on treatment of rare diseases|work=Meath Chronicle}}</ref>\n\n===Agriculture===\n[[File:Silage Harvesting Cadamstown.jpg|thumb|right|[[Silage]] harvesting in [[Clonard, County Meath|Clonard]].]]\nThe agricultural products of the county are [[beef]], [[pork]], [[dairy]], [[poultry]], [[vegetables]] and [[cereals]]. Meath has a strong farming tradition and up until the [[Census of Ireland, 1911|1911 Census]] the most commonly listed occupation in the county was [[Farmworker|farm labourer]]. Meath is ranked 2nd in the country for the production of vegetables and 2nd for the production of [[Rapeseed|rapeseed oil]]. \n\nAs of 2018, Meath has the country's 8th largest cattle herd with 275,301 cows. Dairy production was the largest and most profitable agricultural sector in the county and 63.7% of all cattle were [[Dairy cattle|dairy cows]]. The remaining 36.3% were [[beef cattle]]. The county also has Ireland\u2019s 9th largest sheep herd (150,571 sheep) and 14th largest pig herd (40,259).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.agriculture.gov.ie/animalhealthwelfare/animalidentificationmovement/|title=eAnimal Identification & Movement|work=DAFM}}</ref> Meat processors such as Kepak and Dawn Meats are large employers within the county.\n \nThere are 4,620 farms in the county, with a total farmed area of {{convert|194886|ha|0|abbr=on}}, accounting for 83% of land area. Of this, {{convert|31201|ha|0|abbr=on}} was under tillage, the 3rd highest in the country. Although Irish agriculture is heavily dominated by [[pasture]] farming, Meath's favourable climate and easterly location gives it a much greater capacity than most counties for agricultural diversification, reflected in its robust tillage and vegetable production sectors. The average size of a farm in the county is {{convert|42|ha|0|abbr=on}}, well above the national average of {{convert|31|ha|0|abbr=on}}.  \n\nAgriculture supports thousands of jobs within the county and, according to the [[Irish Farmers' Association]], the total value of agricultural produce from Meath in 2018 was \u20ac541 million, ranking it 6th in Ireland.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ifa.ie/cross-sectors/economics/value-of-agriculture-2016/|title=The Value of Irish Agriculture|work=IFA}}</ref>\n\n===Extraction and Energy===\n[[File:Zinc fragment sublimed and 1cm3 cube.jpg|thumb|right|Meath is the largest producer of [[Zinc]] in [[Europe]].]]\nDue to the geology of the area, Meath has enormous reserves of [[Lead]] and [[Zinc]], which are extracted at [[Tara Mine]] in Navan. Tara is both Europe\u2019s largest and deepest mine, and is currently owned by [[Boliden AB]]. The mine has been in continuous operation since 1977, and a total of 85 million tonnes of ore have been extracted from it, producing 2.6 million tonnes of zinc ore annually.<ref>https://vp217.alertir.com/afw/files/press/boliden/201703089998-1.pdf</ref>\n\nGlacial deposits of gravel exist in a band stretching from the Offaly border at Edenderry, to the sea at Laytown. This is the basis of a long quarrying tradition. The local availability of large deposits of the limestone and shale also gave rise to a significant cement production industry within the county. The two largest cement facilities are at Kinnegad and Platin, the latter of which is owned by [[CRH plc|Irish Cement]] and has the capacity to produce 2.8 million tonnes of cement per annum, which is primarily transported via rail to Dublin for use or export.\n\nIreland\u2019s first waste-to-energy plant opened in Duleek in 2011 and produces 17 MW of electricity per annum.  [[SSE plc|SSE]] [[Airtricity]] aim to build a 208 MW gas-fired power plant south of Drogheda. Meath has a small but growing [[biomass]] industry, however other forms of renewable energy such as [[wind power]] and [[hydroelectricity]] have stalled due to widespread objections. There is an abundance of natural subterranean [[Fault (geology)|faults]] where water from [[hot spring|hot springs]], such as those Enfield,  rise to the surface at 25\u00b0C. There is potential for these to be used for [[Geothermal power|Shallow Geothermal Energy]] generation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meathppn.ie/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Renewable-Energy-Strategy-Proposal-2017.pdf|title=Renewable Energy Strategy for County Meath 2017|work=Meath Environmental Network}}</ref>\n\n==Infrastructure==\n===Road===\n[[File:The M1 Boyne Bridge, near Drogheda, Co.

The [[N3 road (Ireland)|M3]] connects Navan to Dublin and runs from just south of Kells to Clonee, a distance of {{convert|48|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The [[N4 road (Ireland)|M4]] passes through the south of the county and serves as the main road to both [[Sligo]] and [[Galway]], when it divides at [[Kinnegad]] into the N4 and the [[M6 motorway (Ireland)|M6]]. The [[M1 motorway (Republic of Ireland)|M1]] Dublin to [[Belfast]] route traverses East Meath for {{convert|17|km|mi|abbr=on}} before bypassing [[Drogheda]]. \n\nA {{convert|13|km|mi|abbr=on}} stretch of the [[N2 road (Ireland)|N2]] from Ashbourne to the Dublin border at Ward Cross was upgraded to the M2 motorway in 2009. \nTwo [[National primary road|national primary routes]] pass through the county, The N3 and the N2. The M3 becomes the N3 south of Kells before continuing on to [[County Cavan]], a distance of {{convert|12|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The N2 begins at Ashbourne and crosses the county for roughly {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} before entering [[County Louth]] near [[Collon]].  Two [[National secondary road|national secondary routes]] pass through the county. The majority of the [[N51 road (Ireland)|N51]] Drogheda to Mullingar route is located within Meath, and crosses the county for {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}}, passing through Slane, Navan and Athboy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.meath.ie/council/council-services/planning-and-building/development-plans/county-development-plan|title=Meath County Development Plan|work=Meath County Council}}</ref> \n\nThe [[N52 road (Ireland)|N52]] which stretches from [[Nenagh]], where it joins the [[M7 motorway (Ireland)|M7]], to [[Dundalk]], where it joins the N1, crosses the county for {{convert|36|km|mi|abbr=on}} and passes through Kells. [[Bus \u00c9ireann]], as well as private coach operators, provide bus services to villages and towns across the county. Areas close to Dublin city in southern and eastern Meath such as Clonee and Dunboyne are also served by [[Dublin Bus]].\n\n===Rail===\n[[File:M3 Parkway railway station - 2014-05-15.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[M3 Parkway railway station]]]]\n[[Irish Rail]] provides frequent rail services from [[Dunboyne railway station|Dunboyne]] and [[M3 Parkway railway station|M3 Parkway]] to Dublin city centre. Laytown-Bettystown-Mornington as well as Gormanstown also have a commuter rail service and are located long Dublin's 'Northern Commuter Line' which runs from Dundalk to Dublin. A commuter train service (Western Commuter Line) passes through [[Enfield railway station (Ireland)|Enfield]], although the service is less frequent as the station is primarily used for the long-distance Irish rail routes to [[Longford]] and Sligo. \n\nNavan is currently served by a freight-only spur railway line from Drogheda the on the Dublin-Belfast main line, for freight traffic (zinc and lead concentrates from Tara Mines in Navan to Dublin Port) connecting at Drogheda. Currently, the only commuter rail from Dublin to Navan must also pass through Drogheda.  The direct [[Dublin\u2013Navan railway line]] remains disused, though still intact. In June 2018, the [[Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport|Department of Transport]] stated that it would review reopening the line by extending the link past the M3 parkway in 2021.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/question/2018-06-12/117/|title=Rail Network Expansion, Tuesday 12 June 2018|work=Oireachtas}}</ref> \n\n===Air===\nFor commercial and international flights, Meath is serviced by [[Dublin Airport]], which is the closest international airport to the county and has good road links with most major towns. For light aircraft and recreational flying, there are several airstrips located throughout the county which serve as the base of operations for local flying clubs. \n\nThe Trim Aerodrome is primarily used for microlight flying. The Ballybog Airstrip opened in 1990 and provides a number of recreational aviation activities such as [[hot air balloon]] rides and [[air show|air shows]]. There are also airfields at Navan and at Moyglare, across the river rye from [[Kilcock]], County Kildare. \n\nThere is also a military landing strip at [[Gormanstown Camp]] which is not actively used for aircraft. However, the [[Irish Defence Forces]] continue to utilise the airstrip for ground to air combat training.\n\n==Sport==\n===GAA===\n[[File:Croke Park fans on the hill.jpg|thumb|[[Meath GAA|Meath]] supporters (green and yellow) at an All-Ireland Qualifiers game against [[Tyrone GAA|Tyrone]].]]\n[[Gaelic football]] is the most popular sport in the county, and [[Meath GAA]] competes annually in Division 1 of the [[National Football League (Ireland)|National Football League]], the provincial [[Leinster Senior Football Championship]] and the [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]]. Meath has long been the second power of Leinster football, behind rivals [[Dublin GAA|Dublin]], and 26 Leinster Senior Football Championship Finals have been contested between the two, of which Meath emerged victorious on 9 occasions. In total, Meath has won 21 Leinster titles, making the county the second most successful in the province after Dublin.  Given the pre-eminence of Dublin in recent years, Meath's rivalry with [[Louth GAA|Louth]] is now often regarded as the most heated contest, especially after Meath's [[2010 Leinster Senior Football Championship Final|highly controversial win]] over Louth in the [[2010 Leinster Senior Football Championship|2010]] Leinster Final. \n\nMeath has won the national football league 7 times, between 1933 and 1994, the fifth most titles in Ireland. Additionally, Meath has won the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship, the most prestigious competition in Gaelic football, on 7 occasions between 1949 and 1999, also making it the fifth most successful county in Ireland. Meath has also won Leinster's [[O'Byrne Cup]] on 10 occasions, the second most after [[Kildare GAA|Kildare]].\n\nWithin the county, gaelic football clubs compete annually in the [[Meath Senior Football Championship]]. The first championship was played in 1887, in which Dowdstown beat Kells by 1 goal to nothing. The most successful club in Meath is [[Navan O'Mahonys GAA|Navan O'Mahonys]] with 20 Senior Football Championship titles. The most successful club at provincial level is [[Walterstown GFC|Walterstown]], which has won 2 [[Leinster Senior Club Football Championship]] titles in 1980 and 1983. No team from Meath has ever won the [[All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championship]].\n\nIn [[Hurling]], the county competes in Division 2 of the [[National Hurling League]], as well as in the [[Leinster Senior Hurling Championship]] and the [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship]]. Meath is not a [[Dual county|dual county]], and has never won a provincial or national hurling title.\n\nAs with football, the [[Meath Senior Hurling Championship]] is held every year. The first championship in 1902 was won by the [[Navan Hibernians GAC|Navan Hibernians]]. The most successful hurling club in the county is [[Kilmessan GAA|Kilmessan]], with 29 titles, followed by [[Trim GAA|Trim]], with 26. No club team from Meath has ever won the [[Leinster Senior Club Hurling Championship]], and have therefore never qualified for the [[All-Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championship]].\n[[File:Horse Racing at Fairyhouse.jpg|thumb|Horse racing at [[Fairyhouse Racecourse|Fairyhouse]].]]\n===Equestrian Activities===\nActivities such as [[Horse racing]], [[Horse breeding]] and [[Horse training]] are widely popular in Meath. There are 54 studs within the county, including the Dollanstown Stud and Estate, which is one of the most expensive private properties in Ireland. There are numerous race courses within the county, including [[Navan Racecourse|Navan]], [[Fairyhouse Racecourse|Fairyhouse]] and Bellewstown, which host both [[National Hunt racing|National]] Hunt and Flat horse races, such as the [[Brownstown Stakes]], the [[Bobbyjo Chase]], the [[Lismullen Hurdle]] and most notably, the [[Irish Grand National]], which has been held at Fairyhouse since 1870. Beach horse racing also takes place at Laytown.\n\nThe [[Tattersalls]] Country House and equestrian grounds, which hosts the International Horse Trials and Country Fair each year, is located opposite to the Fairyhouse Racecourse near Ratoath. \n\nArtist [[Letitia Marion Hamilton]] from Dunboyne won an Olympic Bronze Medal for [[Art competitions at the 1948 Summer Olympics|oils and watercolours]] in the [[1948 Summer Olympics]] for her depiction of [[List of Irish National Hunt races|The Meath Hunt Point-to-Point Races]].\n\n===Other sports===\n[[File:Killeen Castle 18th Hole.jpg|190px|thumb|18th Hole at Killeen Castle]]\nAs with much of the rest of Ireland, [[association football]] is a popular spectator sport within Meath. The two most prominent football clubs in the county are [[Parkvilla F.C.]] and [[Dunboyne A.F.C.]], which both compete in the [[Leinster Senior League (association football)|Leinster Senior League]]. The lower-tier Meath and District League comprises clubs from counties Meath, Louth, Cavan and Monaghan.  Despite being one of the most populous counties in Ireland, Dunboyne's [[Darragh Lenihan]] is the first and only player from Meath to have represented the [[Republic of Ireland national football team]], after making his debut in 2018.\n\nGolf is also widely played, and there are numerous golf and [[Links (golf)|links]] courses in Meath. [[Killeen Castle, Dunsany|Killeen Castle]] in Dunsany has an 18-hole championship golf course which was designed by [[Jack Nicklaus]] in 2009, and was the venue for the [[2011 Solheim Cup]]. Knightsbrook Golf Club in Trim also has a championship golf course which was designed by [[Christy O'Connor Snr|Christy O'Connor]] in 2006. The County Meath Golf Club in Trim and Royal Tara Golf Club near Navan are two of the most popular golfing locations in the county. Links golf is also played adjacent to the Irish sea coast at the Laytown & Bettystown Golf Club.\n\n[[Athletics (sport)|Athletics]] within the county is organised by the Meath Athletics Board, which overseas the county's 18 athletics clubs. The board is based in Claremont Stadium in Navan, which is a 400m Tartan Athletics Track and Field Stadium. [[Sara Treacy]] of Dunboyne AC represented Ireland in the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]].\n\nSeveral teams from Meath compete in the [[Leinster League]] in [[Rugby union]], most notably [[Ashbourne RFC]], [[Athboy RFC]], [[Navan R.F.C.]] and [[North Meath RFC]]. Former [[Leinster Rugby|Leinster]] and [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]] [[Wing (rugby union)|wing]] [[Shane Horgan]], from [[Bellewstown]], played for [[Boyne RFC]] in [[Drogheda]] at youth level.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Counties of Ireland]]\n*[[Lord Lieutenant of Meath]]\n*[[High Sheriff of Meath]]\n*[[Meath Archaeological and Historical Society]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n{{Wikivoyage}}\n\n*[http://www.meath.ie/ Meath County Council]\n*[http://www.meathtourism.ie/ Meath Tourism]\n\n{{Geographic Location\n|North = [[County Monaghan]]\n|South = [[County Kildare]] <!-- Commented out: [[File:KildareCrest.png|30px]] --><br>[[County Dublin]]\n|East = [[Irish Sea]] and [[County Dublin]]\n|West = [[County Westmeath]]\n|Northeast = [[County Louth]]<!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:Louth Co Co.png|32px]] -->\n|Northwest = [[County Cavan]] [[File:Cavan Coat of Arms.png|22px]]\n|Southwest = [[County Offaly]] [[File:Offaly crest.svg|30px]]\n|Centre = County Meath\n}}\n\n{{County Meath}}\n{{Ireland counties}}{{Authority control}}\n <!-- see [[WP:SUBCAT#Topic_article_rule]] -->\n\n{{Coord|53|40|N|6|40|W|region:IE_type:adm1st_source:GNS-enwiki|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:County Meath| ]]\n[[Category:Leinster|Meath]]\n[[Category:Counties of the Republic of Ireland|Meath]]\n[[Category:Local administrative units of the Republic of Ireland|Meath]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: However  \u2192 However, , Christain \u2192 Christian, inaugaration \u2192 inauguration, \u2019s \u2192 's (10), 998-999 \u2192 998\u2013999 (3)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Meath"}
