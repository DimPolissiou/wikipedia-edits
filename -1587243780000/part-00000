He coached at USC for many years, and is a wonderful man, very full of life, energetic, very supportive, just really was very giving of himself and cheerful all the time, was a great spirit to have around. And one day, we were in between setups and I said, 'Hey, coach, what position did you play?' He said, 'I was a shortstop.' I said, 'Really, could you \u2014 were you good?' He got very quiet, and he said, 'I could field the ball.' I said, 'Could you hit?' He said, 'I could hit the ball.' And he was strangely quiet. And I said to him, 'Well, how come you never played in the majors?' And he said, 'I did.' I said, 'Really?' [Dedeaux said] 'Yes, in 1930-something.' I forget what year he said. He was the starting shortstop for the Brooklyn Dodgers. He played one game, broke his back, and that was the end of his career.<br><br>And I just blanched. I said, 'My God, you're [[Moonlight Graham|Doc Graham]].' He said, 'That's right.' And I said, 'Do you ever think about, \"gee, the career I might've had.\"' And he said, 'Every day.' He said it very quietly. It was very out of character for him, and I was so touched by that. And I did look him up in the Baseball Encyclopedia: He did go, I think, 1-for-4 with an RBI. That was his lifetime stats. So having him be the man who trained all these fellows, including the kid who plays Doc Graham, was very meaningful to me, and I know it was to him, too. It was great to have him around. I think about that often, about what that must have been like, to be good enough to start with a Major League team, and for one unlucky moment, not be able to do \u2014 the rest of your life takes another turn. What he did with that is, he put all of that emotion \u2014 which could have gone into bitterness or regret \u2014 into being a phenomenal coach. He sent more people to the majors than, I think, anybody else in college history. He's an amazing man.</blockquote>\n\n==Personal==\nDedeaux was married to the former Helen L.

He coached at USC for many years, and is a wonderful man, very full of life, energetic, very supportive, just really was very giving of himself and cheerful all the time, was a great spirit to have around. And one day, we were in between setups and I said, 'Hey, coach, what position did you play?' He said, 'I was a shortstop.' I said, 'Really, could you \u2014 were you good?' He got very quiet, and he said, 'I could field the ball.' I said, 'Could you hit?' He said, 'I could hit the ball.' And he was strangely quiet. And I said to him, 'Well, how come you never played in the majors?' And he said, 'I did.' I said, 'Really?' [Dedeaux said] 'Yes, in 1930-something.' I forget what year he said. He was the starting shortstop for the Brooklyn Dodgers. He played one game, broke his back, and that was the end of his career.<br><br>And I just blanched. I said, 'My God, you're [[Moonlight Graham|Doc Graham]].' He said, 'That's right.' And I said, 'Do you ever think about, \"gee, the career I might've had.\"' And he said, 'Every day.' He said it very quietly. It was very out of character for him, and I was so touched by that. And I did look him up in the Baseball Encyclopedia: He did go, I think, 1-for-4 with an RBI. That was his lifetime stats. So having him be the man who trained all these fellows, including the kid who plays Doc Graham, was very meaningful to me, and I know it was to him, too. It was great to have him around. I think about that often, about what that must have been like, to be good enough to start with a Major League team, and for one unlucky moment, not be able to do \u2014 the rest of your life takes another turn. What he did with that is, he put all of that emotion \u2014 which could have gone into bitterness or regret \u2014 into being a phenomenal coach. He sent more people to the majors than, I think, anybody else in college history. He's an amazing man.</blockquote>\n\n==Personal==\nDedeaux was married to the former Helen L.

As of September 2018, it has 14 consecutive seasons of European Cup participations.\n\nSteaua won the European Cup in 1986, becoming the only Romanian club to do so, by defeating [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] on a penalty shootout. They again reached the European Cup Final in 1989, but lost 4&ndash;0 to [[A.C. Milan|Milan]]. Steaua's record win in Europe is a 6\u20130 victory over [[BSC Young Boys|Young Boys]] in the 1979\u201380 Cup Winners' Cup.\n\n==European competitions==\nThe first continental competition organised by UEFA was the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] in 1955. It is the most prestigious European competition and was conceived by the editor of ''[[L'\u00c9quipe]]'' [[Gabriel Hanot]], as a competition for winners of the European national football leagues.<ref>{{harvnb|Moore|2000|p=217}}</ref> The format of the competition was changed for the [[1992\u201393 UEFA Champions League|1992\u201393 season]] to include a group stage instead of the straight knockout format previously in use.

The secondary cup competition is the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]], which was established in 1972. The competition was initially open to teams who finished as runners-up in their respective national leagues.

The club was to be called '''ASA Bucure\u0219ti''' (''Asocia\u021bia Sportiv\u0103 a Armatei Bucure\u0219ti'' \u2013 English: ''Army Sports Association''), with seven different sections ([[association football|football]], [[fencing]], [[volleyball]], [[boxing]], [[shooting]], [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]], [[tennis]]), and its leadership was entrusted to General-Major Oreste Alexandrescu. With a squad gathered in record time, ASA was preparing itself for the [[Divizia B|Romanian second league]] promotion play-offs. However, the new [[Communist]] government that had come to power in 1945 and assumed total control of the country at the end of 1947 stated that every sports association in the country was now to be linked to a certain trade union, be it a State Department, a [[Ministry (government department)|Ministry]] or a [[company]]. However, this was not the case for first league club, Carmen Bucure\u0219ti, owned by wealthy industrialist Dumitru Mociorni\u021b\u0103, who saw his team excluded from the championship and later on dissolved, its place in the 1st league being now taken by newly formed ASA.<ref name=\"Zbuciumata infiintare a Stelei\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.fcsteaua.ro/forum/lofiversion/index.php/t5171.html |title=Zbuciumata infiintare a Stelei |access-date=23 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930155504/http://www.fcsteaua.ro/forum/lofiversion/index.php/t5171.html |archive-date=30 September 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe team's first official competition was the 1947\u201348 [[Divizia A|Romanian Football Championship]] season, in which they finished 14th. Their first official match was played in Bucharest against Dermata Cluj and ended 0-0. The team managed to avoid relegation after a play-out with seven other teams. On 5 June 1948, by Order 289 of the Ministry of National Defence, ASA became '''CSCA''' (''Clubul Sportiv Central al Armatei'' \u2013 English: ''Central Sports Club of the Army''), after which performances began to roll. In March 1950, '''CSCA''' changed its name to '''CCA''' (''Casa Central\u0103 a Armatei'', English: \"Central House of the Army\").\n\nThe 1950s were years of great domestic performances, ones in which the famous \"CCA Golden Team\" was formed. 1956 was one of CCA's most prestigious years, when, apart from winning the title, the team entered a tournament in England where they defeated [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] 4\u20133, drew against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] 1\u20131 and [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] 3\u20133, then lost 5\u20130 to [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]]. Further, on 22 April 1956, the [[Romania national football team|Romania national team]] defeated [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] 1\u20130 in [[Belgrade]] with a team comprised only by CCA players. In 1957, the team also made their first European Cup appearance, falling to [[Borussia Dortmund]] after a play-off in [[Bologna]].\n\nIn 1961, CCA changed its name once again (for the final time) to '''[[CSA Steaua Bucure\u0219ti]]''' (''Clubul Sportiv al Armatei Steaua'' \u2013 English: ''Army Sports Club Steaua''). The word \"''steaua''\" is Romanian for \"the star'' and was adopted because of the presence, just like in any other [[Eastern-European]] [[Army]] team, of a [[red star]] on their badge.\n\n[[File:Steaua si Cupa Campionilor Europeni.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Steaua squad with the European Cup after victory in the [[1986 European Cup Final]].]]\n\nUnder the leadership of coaches [[Emerich Jenei]] and [[Anghel Iord\u0103nescu]], Steaua had an impressive Championship run in the 1984\u201385 season, which they eventually won after a six-year drought. What followed was an astonishing [[European Cup 1985-86|European Cup]] season. After knocking-out [[Vejle Boldklub]], [[Budapest Honv\u00e9d FC|Budapest Honv\u00e9d]], [[Kuusysi Lahti FC|Lahti]] and [[RSC Anderlecht|Anderlecht]], they were the first ever Romanian team to make it into a Champions League final. On 7 May 1986, at the [[Ram\u00f3n S\u00e1nchez Pizju\u00e1n Stadium]] in [[Seville]], Spanish champions [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] were clear favourites, but after a goalless draw, goalkeeper [[Helmuth Duckadam]] saved all four penalties taken by Bar\u00e7a, being the first ever Romanian to reach the [[Guinness Book]] for that achievement,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.clujeanul.ro/articol/ziar/cluj/visul-guinness/2986/\n|title=Visul \"Guinness\"\n|work=Clujeanul\n|author1=Calabalic, Petrina |author2=Marta, Bogdan |date=2004-09-06\n|accessdate=2007-06-10}}</ref> while [[Gavril Balint]] and [[Marius L\u0103c\u0103tu\u0219]] converted their penalties to make Steaua the first Eastern European team to win the supreme continental trophy.\n\n[[Gheorghe Hagi]], arguably the all-time best Romanian footballer, joined the club a few months later, scoring the only goal of the match against [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] which brought Steaua an additional European Super Cup on 24 February 1987 in [[Monaco]], just two months after having lost the [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]] 1\u20130 to Argentinians [[Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate|River Plate]] in [[Tokyo]].\n\nSteaua remained at the top of European football for the rest of the decade, managing one more Champions League semi-final against [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] ([[1987\u201388 European Cup|1987\u201388]]) and one more Champions League final in [[1989 European Cup Final|1989]], which was lost 4\u20130 in to the [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] side of [[Marco van Basten]], [[Ruud Gullit]] and [[Frank Rijkaard]].\n\nDuring these last years of the Communist regime in Romania, dictator [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]]'s son Valentin was involved in the life of the team. Even though a controversial character, [[Valentin Ceau\u0219escu]] admitted in a recent interview he had done nothing else than to protect his favourite team from [[FC Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti|Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti]]'s sphere of influence, ensured by the Ministry of Internal Affairs.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.ceausescu.org/ceausescu_texts/valentin_mega_interview_ro.html\n|title='Mega-interviu' cu Valentin Ceausescu\n|work=Ceausescu.org\n|accessdate=2007-06-15\n}}</ref> Though contested by some, their five-year winning streak in the championship between 1984\u201385 and 1988\u201389 corroborates the notion that the team was really the best during this period.\n\n===Post-Revolution (1990-date)===\nThe [[Romanian Revolution]] led the country towards a free open market and, subsequently, several players of the great 1980s team left for other clubs in the West.

However, a swift recovery followed and Steaua managed a six consecutive championship streak between 1992\u201393 and 1997\u201398. The club managed to reach the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] quarter-finals in 1993, when they lost on away goals to [[Royal Antwerp F.C.|Royal Antwerp]], and also qualified for the Champions League group stage for three-straight years between 1994\u201395 and 1996\u201397.\n\nIn 1998, following lobbying from football department president Marcel Pu\u0219ca\u0219 and new [[Romanian Professional Footbal League (LPF)|LPF]] regulations, the football club separated from CSA Steaua Bucure\u0219ti and changed their name for the final time to '''FC Steaua Bucure\u0219ti''' (''Fotbal Club Steaua Bucure\u0219ti'').<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.ziua.ro/display.php?id=8354&data=1998-05-29\n|title=Politica mineaza sportul rom\u00e2nesc\n|work=Ziua\n|language=Romanian\n|url-status=dead\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930183349/http://www.ziua.ro/display.php?id=8354&data=1998-05-29\n|archive-date=2007-09-30\n|access-date=2013-08-08}}</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 2004, following a third consecutive year with no trophy won, former Italy [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] [[Walter Zenga]] was appointed as head coach, becoming the first ever foreign Steaua manager. Following the appointment, results came immediately, as the team qualified for the UEFA Cup group stage and further on became the first Romanian team to make it to the European football spring since 1993, where they defeated holders [[Valencia CF|Valencia]] after a penalty shoot-out at Ghencea. Zenga was sacked with three matchdays to go in the Divizia A, but Steaua eventually won the title, performance repeated the following year with manager [[Cosmin Ol\u0103roiu]]. Under Ol\u0103roiu they reached the UEFA Cup semi-finals in [[2005\u201306 UEFA Cup|2005\u201306]], where they were eliminated by [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] by a last minute goal. This was their best performance at a European competition since reaching the final of the [[1988-89 European Cup]].\n\nThe next season, after having successfully passed two qualifying rounds against [[ND Gorica|Gorica]] and [[Standard Li\u00e8ge]], Steaua reached the group stage of the [[2006\u201307 UEFA Champions League]], where they finished in third position in Group E, behind [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] (0\u20133 home, 1\u20131 away) and Real Madrid (1\u20134 home, 0\u20131 away) and in front of Dynamo Kyiv (1\u20131 home, 4\u20131 away). However, their continuation in the [[2006\u201307 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] was short, having been eliminated by title holders [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]] in the round of 32.\n\nIn the [[2007\u201308 UEFA Champions League]], they eliminated [[Zag\u0142\u0119bie Lubin]] (1\u20130 away and 2\u20131 home) and [[FC BATE Borisov|BATE Borisov]] (2\u20132 away and 2\u20130 home) to reach the group stage, where they were drawn alongside Arsenal, Sevilla and [[AC Sparta Prague|Sparta Prague]]. However, their performance was sub-par, finishing last with one point.\n\nThe [[2008\u201309 UEFA Champions League]] season saw Steaua advance to the group stage after defeating [[Galatasaray S.K. (football)|Galatasaray]] (2\u20132 away and 1\u20130 home), only to again finish in last place with one point, after [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], Lyon and Fiorentina.\n\nThe 2012-13 season saw Steaua achieve their best European performance in six seasons, reaching the [[2012-13 UEFA Europa League]] Round of 16 where they lost to eventual winners [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. Steaua most recently qualified for the Champions League group stages in [[2013\u201314 UEFA Champions League|2013-14]], finishing last in their group with Chelsea, [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke]] and [[FC Basel|Basel]].\n\n==Total statistics==\n{{small|''As of 29 August 2019''}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!style=\"background:#DCDCDC\"|Competition\n!width=\"35\" style=\"background:#DCDCDC\"|{{Tooltip| S | Seasons}}\n!width=\"35\" style=\"background:#DCDCDC\"|{{Tooltip| P | Played}}\n!width=\"35\" style=\"background:#DCDCDC\"|{{Tooltip| W | Won}}\n!width=\"35\" style=\"background:#DCDCDC\"|{{Tooltip| D | Drawn}}\n!width=\"35\" style=\"background:#DCDCDC\"|{{Tooltip| L | Lost}}\n!width=\"35\" style=\"background:#DCDCDC\"|{{Tooltip| GF | Goals for}}\n!width=\"35\" style=\"background:#DCDCDC\"|{{Tooltip| GA | Goals against}}\n!width=\"35\" style=\"background:#DCDCDC\"|{{Tooltip| GD | Goal difference}}\n|-\n|align=left|[[UEFA Champions League]] / European Cup\n|28||144||52||40||52||203||204||\u22121\n|-\n|align=left|[[UEFA Super Cup]] / European Super Cup\n|1||1||1||0||0||1||0||+1\n|-\n|align=left|[[UEFA Europa League]] / UEFA Cup\n|20||142||58||38||46||191||163||+28\n|-\n|align=left|[[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] / European Cup Winners' Cup\n|11||40||14||12||14||51||54||\u22123\n|-\n|align=left|[[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]]\n|1||1||0||0||1||0||1||\u22121\n|-\n|-class=\"sortbottom\"\n!

of European Football Associations]] (UEFA) competitions. Qualification for Romanian clubs is determined by a team's performance in its domestic league and cup competitions. Steaua have regularly qualified for the primary European competition, the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]], by winning the [[Liga I]]. Steaua have also achieved European qualification via the [[Cupa Rom\u00e2niei]] and have played in both the former [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] and the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] (now called the UEFA Europa League).\n\nSteaua's first match in European competition was in the [[1957\u201358 European Cup]] against [[Borussia Dortmund]] of West Germany. They have competed in 28 times in the European Champions' Cup / Champions League, 18 times in the UEFA Cup / Europa League and 11 times in the Cup Winners' Cup. There were five consecutive participations in the European Cup during the 1980s and six in the 1990s. Since 2003, Steaua is a regular appearance in the European Competitions. As of September 2018, it has 14 consecutive seasons of European Cup participations.\n\nSteaua won the European Cup in 1986, becoming the only Romanian club to do so, by defeating [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] on a penalty shootout. They again reached the European Cup Final in 1989, but lost 4&ndash;0 to [[A.C. Milan|Milan]]. Steaua's record win in Europe is a 6\u20130 victory over [[BSC Young Boys|Young Boys]] in the 1979\u201380 Cup Winners' Cup.\n\n==European competitions==\nThe first continental competition organised by UEFA was the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] in 1955. It is the most prestigious European competition and was conceived by the editor of ''[[L'\u00c9quipe]]'' [[Gabriel Hanot]], as a competition for winners of the European national football leagues.<ref>{{harvnb|Moore|2000|p=217}}</ref> The format of the competition was changed for the [[1992\u201393 UEFA Champions League|1992\u201393 season]] to include a group stage instead of the straight knockout format previously in use.

The secondary cup competition is the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]], which was established in 1972. The competition was initially open to teams who finished as runners-up in their respective national leagues. This was later expanded based on the countries rank in the coefficients and performance in domestic cup competitions.

The club was to be called '''ASA Bucure\u0219ti''' (''Asocia\u021bia Sportiv\u0103 a Armatei Bucure\u0219ti'' \u2013 English: ''Army Sports Association''), with seven different sections ([[association football|football]], [[fencing]], [[volleyball]], [[boxing]], [[shooting]], [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]], [[tennis]]), and its leadership was entrusted to General-Major Oreste Alexandrescu. With a squad gathered in record time, ASA was preparing itself for the [[Divizia B|Romanian second league]] promotion play-offs. However, the new [[Communist]] government that had come to power in 1945 and assumed total control of the country at the end of 1947 stated that every sports association in the country was now to be linked to a certain trade union, be it a State Department, a [[Ministry (government department)|Ministry]] or a [[company]]. However, this was not the case for first league club, Carmen Bucure\u0219ti, owned by wealthy industrialist Dumitru Mociorni\u021b\u0103, who saw his team excluded from the championship and later on dissolved, its place in the 1st league being now taken by newly formed ASA.<ref name=\"Zbuciumata infiintare a Stelei\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.fcsteaua.ro/forum/lofiversion/index.php/t5171.html |title=Zbuciumata infiintare a Stelei |access-date=23 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930155504/http://www.fcsteaua.ro/forum/lofiversion/index.php/t5171.html |archive-date=30 September 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe team's first official competition was the 1947\u201348 [[Divizia A|Romanian Football Championship]] season, in which they finished 14th. Their first official match was played in Bucharest against Dermata Cluj and ended 0-0. The team managed to avoid relegation after a play-out with seven other teams. On 5 June 1948, by Order 289 of the Ministry of National Defence, ASA became '''CSCA''' (''Clubul Sportiv Central al Armatei'' \u2013 English: ''Central Sports Club of the Army''), after which performances began to roll. In March 1950, '''CSCA''' changed its name to '''CCA''' (''Casa Central\u0103 a Armatei'', English: \"Central House of the Army\").\n\nThe 1950s were years of great domestic performances, ones in which the famous \"CCA Golden Team\" was formed. 1956 was one of CCA's most prestigious years, when, apart from winning the title, the team entered a tournament in England where they defeated [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] 4\u20133, drew against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] 1\u20131 and [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] 3\u20133, then lost 5\u20130 to [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]]. Further, on 22 April 1956, the [[Romania national football team|Romania national team]] defeated [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] 1\u20130 in [[Belgrade]] with a team comprised only by CCA players. In 1957, the team also made their first European Cup appearance, falling to [[Borussia Dortmund]] after a play-off in [[Bologna]].\n\nIn 1961, CCA changed its name once again (for the final time) to '''[[CSA Steaua Bucure\u0219ti]]''' (''Clubul Sportiv al Armatei Steaua'' \u2013 English: ''Army Sports Club Steaua''). The word \"''steaua''\" is Romanian for \"the star'' and was adopted because of the presence, just like in any other [[Eastern-European]] [[Army]] team, of a [[red star]] on their badge.\n\n[[File:Steaua si Cupa Campionilor Europeni.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Steaua squad with the European Cup after victory in the [[1986 European Cup Final]].]]\n\nUnder the leadership of coaches [[Emerich Jenei]] and [[Anghel Iord\u0103nescu]], Steaua had an impressive Championship run in the 1984\u201385 season, which they eventually won after a six-year drought. What followed was an astonishing [[European Cup 1985-86|European Cup]] season. After knocking-out [[Vejle Boldklub]], [[Budapest Honv\u00e9d FC|Budapest Honv\u00e9d]], [[Kuusysi Lahti FC|Lahti]] and [[RSC Anderlecht|Anderlecht]], they were the first ever Romanian team to make it into a Champions League final. On 7 May 1986, at the [[Ram\u00f3n S\u00e1nchez Pizju\u00e1n Stadium]] in [[Seville]], Spanish champions [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] were clear favourites, but after a goalless draw, goalkeeper [[Helmuth Duckadam]] saved all four penalties taken by Bar\u00e7a, being the first ever Romanian to reach the [[Guinness Book]] for that achievement,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.clujeanul.ro/articol/ziar/cluj/visul-guinness/2986/\n|title=Visul \"Guinness\"\n|work=Clujeanul\n|author1=Calabalic, Petrina |author2=Marta, Bogdan |date=2004-09-06\n|accessdate=2007-06-10}}</ref> while [[Gavril Balint]] and [[Marius L\u0103c\u0103tu\u0219]] converted their penalties to make Steaua the first Eastern European team to win the supreme continental trophy.\n\n[[Gheorghe Hagi]], arguably the all-time best Romanian footballer, joined the club a few months later, scoring the only goal of the match against [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] which brought Steaua an additional European Super Cup on 24 February 1987 in [[Monaco]], just two months after having lost the [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]] 1\u20130 to Argentinians [[Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate|River Plate]] in [[Tokyo]].\n\nSteaua remained at the top of European football for the rest of the decade, managing one more Champions League semi-final against [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] ([[1987\u201388 European Cup|1987\u201388]]) and one more Champions League final in [[1989 European Cup Final|1989]], which was lost 4\u20130 in to the [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] side of [[Marco van Basten]], [[Ruud Gullit]] and [[Frank Rijkaard]].\n\nDuring these last years of the Communist regime in Romania, dictator [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]]'s son Valentin was involved in the life of the team. Even though a controversial character, [[Valentin Ceau\u0219escu]] admitted in a recent interview he had done nothing else than to protect his favourite team from [[FC Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti|Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti]]'s sphere of influence, ensured by the Ministry of Internal Affairs.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.ceausescu.org/ceausescu_texts/valentin_mega_interview_ro.html\n|title='Mega-interviu' cu Valentin Ceausescu\n|work=Ceausescu.org\n|accessdate=2007-06-15\n}}</ref> Though contested by some, their five-year winning streak in the championship between 1984\u201385 and 1988\u201389 corroborates the notion that the team was really the best during this period.\n\n===Post-Revolution (1990-date)===\nThe [[Romanian Revolution]] led the country towards a free open market and, subsequently, several players of the great 1980s team left for other clubs in the West.

However, a swift recovery followed and Steaua managed a six consecutive championship streak between 1992\u201393 and 1997\u201398. The club managed to reach the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] quarter-finals in 1993, when they lost on away goals to [[Royal Antwerp F.C.|Royal Antwerp]], and also qualified for the Champions League group stage for three-straight years between 1994\u201395 and 1996\u201397.\n\nIn 1998, following lobbying from football department president Marcel Pu\u0219ca\u0219 and new [[Romanian Professional Footbal League (LPF)|LPF]] regulations, the football club separated from CSA Steaua Bucure\u0219ti and changed their name for the final time to '''FC Steaua Bucure\u0219ti''' (''Fotbal Club Steaua Bucure\u0219ti'').<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.ziua.ro/display.php?id=8354&data=1998-05-29\n|title=Politica mineaza sportul rom\u00e2nesc\n|work=Ziua\n|language=Romanian\n|url-status=dead\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930183349/http://www.ziua.ro/display.php?id=8354&data=1998-05-29\n|archive-date=2007-09-30\n|access-date=2013-08-08}}</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 2004, following a third consecutive year with no trophy won, former Italy [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] [[Walter Zenga]] was appointed as head coach, becoming the first ever foreign Steaua manager. Following the appointment, results came immediately, as the team qualified for the UEFA Cup group stage and further on became the first Romanian team to make it to the European football spring since 1993, where they defeated holders [[Valencia CF|Valencia]] after a penalty shoot-out at Ghencea. Zenga was sacked with three matchdays to go in the Divizia A, but Steaua eventually won the title, performance repeated the following year with manager [[Cosmin Ol\u0103roiu]]. Under Ol\u0103roiu they reached the UEFA Cup semi-finals in [[2005\u201306 UEFA Cup|2005\u201306]], where they were eliminated by [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] by a last minute goal. This was their best performance at a European competition since reaching the final of the [[1988-89 European Cup]].\n\nThe next season, after having successfully passed two qualifying rounds against [[ND Gorica|Gorica]] and [[Standard Li\u00e8ge]], Steaua reached the group stage of the [[2006\u201307 UEFA Champions League]], where they finished in third position in Group E, behind [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] (0\u20133 home, 1\u20131 away) and Real Madrid (1\u20134 home, 0\u20131 away) and in front of Dynamo Kyiv (1\u20131 home, 4\u20131 away). However, their continuation in the [[2006\u201307 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] was short, having been eliminated by title holders [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]] in the round of 32.\n\nIn the [[2007\u201308 UEFA Champions League]], they eliminated [[Zag\u0142\u0119bie Lubin]] (1\u20130 away and 2\u20131 home) and [[FC BATE Borisov|BATE Borisov]] (2\u20132 away and 2\u20130 home) to reach the group stage, where they were drawn alongside Arsenal, Sevilla and [[AC Sparta Prague|Sparta Prague]]. However, their performance was sub-par, finishing last with one point.\n\nThe [[2008\u201309 UEFA Champions League]] season saw Steaua advance to the group stage after defeating [[Galatasaray S.K. (football)|Galatasaray]] (2\u20132 away and 1\u20130 home), only to again finish in last place with one point, after [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], Lyon and Fiorentina.\n\nThe 2012-13 season saw Steaua achieve their best European performance in six seasons, reaching the [[2012-13 UEFA Europa League]] Round of 16 where they lost to eventual winners [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. Steaua most recently qualified for the Champions League group stages in [[2013\u201314 UEFA Champions League|2013-14]], finishing last in their group with Chelsea, [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke]] and [[FC Basel|Basel]].\n\n==Total statistics==\n{{small|''As of 29 August 2019''}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!style=\"background:#DCDCDC\"|Competition\n!width=\"35\" style=\"background:#DCDCDC\"|{{Tooltip| S | Seasons}}\n!width=\"35\" style=\"background:#DCDCDC\"|{{Tooltip| P | Played}}\n!width=\"35\" style=\"background:#DCDCDC\"|{{Tooltip| W | Won}}\n!width=\"35\" style=\"background:#DCDCDC\"|{{Tooltip| D | Drawn}}\n!width=\"35\" style=\"background:#DCDCDC\"|{{Tooltip| L | Lost}}\n!width=\"35\" style=\"background:#DCDCDC\"|{{Tooltip| GF | Goals for}}\n!width=\"35\" style=\"background:#DCDCDC\"|{{Tooltip| GA | Goals against}}\n!width=\"35\" style=\"background:#DCDCDC\"|{{Tooltip| GD | Goal difference}}\n|-\n|align=left|[[UEFA Champions League]] / European Cup\n|28||144||52||40||52||203||204||\u22121\n|-\n|align=left|[[UEFA Super Cup]] / European Super Cup\n|1||1||1||0||0||1||0||+1\n|-\n|align=left|[[UEFA Europa League]] / UEFA Cup\n|20||142||58||38||46||191||163||+28\n|-\n|align=left|[[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] / European Cup Winners' Cup\n|11||40||14||12||14||51||54||\u22123\n|-\n|align=left|[[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]]\n|1||1||0||0||1||0||1||\u22121\n|-\n|-class=\"sortbottom\"\n!

The story concerns a young woman raised in an unwholesome environment who joins a [[Confidence trick|confidence racket]] run by one of her mother's friends. She agrees to marry the victim of one of her scams, becomes a war widow, and is left to raise a baby, but abandons it each evening to go out dancing. After the child suffers an accident in her absence, she is charged with child neglect and loses custody. She mends her ways by devotedly caring for an abandoned infant and meets up again with the con man, who has also reformed after a prison stint, and together they build a new life.

Together they trick men out of money. Ziggy takes a liking to a con artist, Denny Reagan, and steals a soldier's watch that Denny admires. The watch's inscription, showing it is a gift from the boy's mother, gives Denny a guilty conscience, so Ziggy returns it to Mart Neilson, the soldier. He asks her on a date, which leads to marriage. Two days later, Neilson is shipped off to war. He is killed in action while Ziggy is pregnant with their child.\n\nZiggy is warned by Natalie after the birth of baby Martha that she is not fit for motherhood. Denny is now doing time in a penitentiary, so he is no help either. Ziggy likes to go out dancing every night, leaving Martha with an irresponsible young babysitter. While the babysitter sneaks out to be with her boyfriend, Martha tumbles out of her crib and is nearly strangled by the bedsheets. A landlady's testimony results in the baby being sent to a juvenile ward. Ziggy is given a suspended sentence for child neglect, but is forbidden from having contact with her child. Denny's mother tracks down Ziggy and encourages her to pray for salvation.\n\nBy the time Denny leaves prison, he is a reformed man. He tracks down Ziggy and finds that she has taken in an abandoned infant and is caring for it, having named him Denny. Together they appeal to the court for a second chance, then leave together with both children, united as a family.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[James Dunn (actor)|James Dunn]] as Denny Reagan\n* [[Mona Freeman]] as Ziggy Brennan\n* William Marshall as CPO Martin J.

Together they trick men out of money. Ziggy takes a liking to a con artist, Denny Reagan, and steals a soldier's watch that Denny admires. The watch's inscription, showing it is a gift from the boy's mother, gives Denny a guilty conscience, so Ziggy returns it to Mart Neilson, the soldier. He asks her on a date, which leads to marriage. Two days later, Neilson is shipped off to war. He is killed in action while Ziggy is pregnant with their child.\n\nZiggy is warned by Natalie after the birth of baby Martha that she is not fit for motherhood. Denny is now doing time in a penitentiary, so he is no help either. Ziggy likes to go out dancing every night, leaving Martha with an irresponsible young babysitter. While the babysitter sneaks out to be with her boyfriend, Martha tumbles out of her crib and is nearly strangled by the bedsheets. A landlady's testimony results in the baby being sent to a juvenile ward. Ziggy is given a suspended sentence for child neglect, but is forbidden from having contact with her child. Denny's mother tracks down Ziggy and encourages her to pray for salvation.\n\nBy the time Denny leaves prison, he is a reformed man. He tracks down Ziggy and finds that she has taken in an abandoned infant and is caring for it, having named him Denny. Together they appeal to the court for a second chance, then leave together with both children, united as a family.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[James Dunn (actor)|James Dunn]] as Denny Reagan\n* [[Mona Freeman]] as Ziggy Brennan\n* William Marshall as CPO Martin J.

From the time he secured the deal, Swan began composition of \"I Can Help\" in a music room that his wife, Marlu, had converted from a closet inside the small duplex that they shared close to [[Centennial Park (Nashville)|Centennial Park]].<ref name = \"Sound on Sound\">Buskin, Richard. [http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/nov07/articles/classictracks_1107.htm?print=yes Classic Tracks: Billy Swan \"I Can Help\"]. [[Sound on Sound]]. November 2007. Accessed from December 21, 2012.</ref> Swan has revealed that he used a \"Rock\" preset, from his Rhythm Master [[drum machine]], when writing the song;<ref name = \"Sound on Sound\"/> \"It played 16ths and sounded like a [[Hi-hat|sock cymbal]], so I just started playing these chords along with it, and the song came in about 20 minutes. I didn't always write that quickly, but from my experience the ones that come quickly are the good ones. \"[[Lover Please]]\" was like that, and so was \"Everything's the Same\". With \"I Can Help\" I actually wrote the three verses first, and since I needed something to put between the second and third verse I then came up with the bridge. The whole thing just came out of the air, including the words.\"<ref name = \"Sound on Sound\"/>\n\n\"I Can Help\" was written during March 1974, and also during that time Swan recorded it with producer and engineer [[Chip Young]] at the Young'un Sound studio in Murfreesboro, TN. The distinctive keyboards were played by Swan on a portable [[Farfisa]] belonging to Memphis session musician [[Bobby Emmons]] while Young's [[German Shepherd]] puppy, Bowser, tugged on his pants leg.<ref name = \"Sound on Sound\"/> The vocals were recorded with a [[U 47|Neumann U47]], while Swan's Farfisa, [[Mike Leech]]'s bass and [[Reggie Young]]'s guitar, were all recorded direct. Dennis Linde and Johnny Christopher, who performed for the song on [[acoustic guitar]]s, were each miked with Sony ECM lapel mics, while the setup for [[Hayword Bishop]]'s drums comprised another pair of ECMs overhead on the cymbals, an Electrovoice RE15 on the toms, an RE20 on the kick and a Shure SM58 on the snare.<ref name = \"Sound on Sound\"/> Keyboardist [[Bobby Wood (musician)|Bobby Wood]] was also booked for the session, but after hearing the track and realising he wasn't needed he joined Emmons and Young in the control room. Emmons and Young suggested overdubbing handclaps at the end to convey an in-studio party atmosphere, as well as adding some bridge-section backing vocals by [[Lea Jane Berinati]] and the [[Holliday Sister]]s.<ref name = \"Sound on Sound\"/> Swan recalls, \"Chip was excited after he recorded that part, but I went out there and listened to it, and I said, 'Boy, I don't know.' I listened to it over and over, until finally I said, 'Hey, man, nothing else will work.' It was actually a great solo, so that just shows you where my head is at. That part was so perfect, and today a lot of people remember the song because of that solo.\"<ref name = \"Sound on Sound\"/>\n\nThe album version contains a [[False ending#Music|false ending]] with the clapping followed by a reasonably extended cadenza on the organ, which then is followed by an instrumental repeat of the ending, followed by another brief organ cadenza, which afterwards is then followed by another instrumental repeat of the ending before the song's fade.\n\n==Release==\nSwan's version of \"I Can Help\" was released toward the end of July 1974. To make more money from the song's commercial success, the co-producers returned to Young'un Sound to record more material for an ''I Can Help'' album. This included covers of \"Don't Be Cruel\", \"Shake, Rattle & Roll\" and Swan's own \"Lover Please\".<ref name = \"Sound on Sound\"/>\n\nHowever, the success of the song led the record company to argue about which would be the first single on the album. \"Everyone at the record company had actually wanted 'The Ways of a Woman in Love' to be the first single,\" Young recalls. \"I said, 'No, wait a minute. That's not the hit. The hit is \"I Can Help\".' However, [Monument Records president] Fred Foster then hired a guy who was supposed to know the ins and outs of the business, and he said, 'There aren't any hits here. We've gotta re-cut a bunch of stuff.' I said, 'No, we don't have to re-cut a bunch of stuff.' It was a battle from then on.\"<ref name = \"Sound on Sound\"/>\n\n==Chart performance==\nIn addition to being a No. 1 country and pop hit, \"I Can Help\" reached No. 6 on ''Billboard'''s [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks|Hot Adult Contemporary Singles]] chart and No. 6 on the United Kingdom's ''[[Record Retailer]]'' chart. In addition, the song was a hit throughout most of Europe and also reached No. 1 in Australia. \"I Can Help\" was so successful in Norway that it charted for 37 weeks on the Norwegian charts (VG-lista Top 10), making it the 4th best-performing single of all time in that country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://norwegiancharts.com/bestall.asp |title=BEST OF ALL TIME \u2013 SINGLES |publisher=Hung Medien |work=[[VG-lista]] |accessdate=April 12, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102064910/http://www.norwegiancharts.com//bestall.asp |archivedate=November 2, 2014 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n\"I Can Help\" is certified gold for sales of 1,000,000 units by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.riaa.com/gp/database/search_results.asp |title=Recording Industry Association of America |website=Web.archive.org |date=2007-06-08 |accessdate=2016-10-09 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608063940/http://www.riaa.com/gp/database/search_results.asp |archivedate=June 8, 2007 |df=mdy }}</ref> In U.K., it has \"Silver\" certification, and in France, it has sales about 700,000.\n\n===Weekly singles charts===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1974\u201375)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n{{singlechart|Billboardcountrysongs|1|artist=Billy Swan}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Billboardhot100|1|artist=Billy Swan}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Billboardadultcontemporary|6|artist=Billy Swan}}\n|-\n|Canadian ''RPM'' Country Tracks\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|Canadian ''RPM'' Top Singles\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2\n|-\n|Canada ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' Adult Contemporary<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/films-videos-sound-recordings/rpm/Pages/image.aspx?Image=nlc008388.3911&URLjpg=http%3a%2f%2fwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca%2fobj%2f028020%2ff4%2fnlc008388.3911.gif&Ecopy=nlc008388.3911 |title=Image : RPM Weekly -

From the time he secured the deal, Swan began composition of \"I Can Help\" in a music room that his wife, Marlu, had converted from a closet inside the small duplex that they shared close to [[Centennial Park (Nashville)|Centennial Park]].<ref name = \"Sound on Sound\">Buskin, Richard. [http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/nov07/articles/classictracks_1107.htm?print=yes Classic Tracks: Billy Swan \"I Can Help\"]. [[Sound on Sound]]. November 2007. Accessed from December 21, 2012.</ref> Swan has revealed that he used a \"Rock\" preset, from his Rhythm Master [[drum machine]], when writing the song;<ref name = \"Sound on Sound\"/> \"It played 16ths and sounded like a sock cymbal, so I just started playing these chords along with it, and the song came in about 20 minutes. I didn't always write that quickly, but from my experience the ones that come quickly are the good ones. \"[[Lover Please]]\" was like that, and so was \"Everything's the Same\". With \"I Can Help\" I actually wrote the three verses first, and since I needed something to put between the second and third verse I then came up with the bridge. The whole thing just came out of the air, including the words.\"<ref name = \"Sound on Sound\"/>\n\n\"I Can Help\" was written during March 1974, and also during that time Swan recorded it with producer and engineer [[Chip Young]] at the Young'un Sound studio in Murfreesboro, TN. The distinctive keyboards were played by Swan on a portable [[Farfisa]] belonging to Memphis session musician [[Bobby Emmons]] while Young's [[German Shepherd]] puppy, Bowser, tugged on his pants leg.<ref name = \"Sound on Sound\"/> The vocals were recorded with a [[U 47|Neumann U47]], while Swan's Farfisa, [[Mike Leech]]'s bass and [[Reggie Young]]'s guitar, were all recorded direct. Dennis Linde and Johnny Christopher, who performed for the song on [[acoustic guitar]]s, were each miked with Sony ECM lapel mics, while the setup for [[Hayword Bishop]]'s drums comprised another pair of ECMs overhead on the cymbals, an Electrovoice RE15 on the toms, an RE20 on the kick and a Shure SM58 on the snare.<ref name = \"Sound on Sound\"/> Keyboardist [[Bobby Wood (musician)|Bobby Wood]] was also booked for the session, but after hearing the track and realising he wasn't needed he joined Emmons and Young in the control room. Emmons and Young suggested overdubbing handclaps at the end to convey an in-studio party atmosphere, as well as adding some bridge-section backing vocals by [[Lea Jane Berinati]] and the [[Holliday Sister]]s.<ref name = \"Sound on Sound\"/> Swan recalls, \"Chip was excited after he recorded that part, but I went out there and listened to it, and I said, 'Boy, I don't know.' I listened to it over and over, until finally I said, 'Hey, man, nothing else will work.' It was actually a great solo, so that just shows you where my head is at. That part was so perfect, and today a lot of people remember the song because of that solo.\"<ref name = \"Sound on Sound\"/>\n\nThe album version contains a [[False ending#Music|false ending]] with the clapping followed by a reasonably extended cadenza on the organ, which then is followed by an instrumental repeat of the ending, followed by another brief organ cadenza, which afterwards is then followed by another instrumental repeat of the ending before the song's fade.\n\n==Release==\nSwan's version of \"I Can Help\" was released toward the end of July 1974. To make more money from the song's commercial success, the co-producers returned to Young'un Sound to record more material for an ''I Can Help'' album. This included covers of \"Don't Be Cruel\", \"Shake, Rattle & Roll\" and Swan's own \"Lover Please\".<ref name = \"Sound on Sound\"/>\n\nHowever, the success of the song led the record company to argue about which would be the first single on the album. \"Everyone at the record company had actually wanted 'The Ways of a Woman in Love' to be the first single,\" Young recalls. \"I said, 'No, wait a minute. That's not the hit. The hit is \"I Can Help\".' However, [Monument Records president] Fred Foster then hired a guy who was supposed to know the ins and outs of the business, and he said, 'There aren't any hits here. We've gotta re-cut a bunch of stuff.' I said, 'No, we don't have to re-cut a bunch of stuff.' It was a battle from then on.\"<ref name = \"Sound on Sound\"/>\n\n==Chart performance==\nIn addition to being a No. 1 country and pop hit, \"I Can Help\" reached No. 6 on ''Billboard'''s [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks|Hot Adult Contemporary Singles]] chart and No. 6 on the United Kingdom's ''[[Record Retailer]]'' chart. In addition, the song was a hit throughout most of Europe and also reached No. 1 in Australia. \"I Can Help\" was so successful in Norway that it charted for 37 weeks on the Norwegian charts (VG-lista Top 10), making it the 4th best-performing single of all time in that country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://norwegiancharts.com/bestall.asp |title=BEST OF ALL TIME \u2013 SINGLES |publisher=Hung Medien |work=[[VG-lista]] |accessdate=April 12, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102064910/http://www.norwegiancharts.com//bestall.asp |archivedate=November 2, 2014 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n\"I Can Help\" is certified gold for sales of 1,000,000 units by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.riaa.com/gp/database/search_results.asp |title=Recording Industry Association of America |website=Web.archive.org |date=2007-06-08 |accessdate=2016-10-09 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608063940/http://www.riaa.com/gp/database/search_results.asp |archivedate=June 8, 2007 |df=mdy }}</ref> In U.K., it has \"Silver\" certification, and in France, it has sales about 700,000.\n\n===Weekly singles charts===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1974\u201375)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n{{singlechart|Billboardcountrysongs|1|artist=Billy Swan}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Billboardhot100|1|artist=Billy Swan}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Billboardadultcontemporary|6|artist=Billy Swan}}\n|-\n|Canadian ''RPM'' Country Tracks\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|Canadian ''RPM'' Top Singles\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2\n|-\n|Canada ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' Adult Contemporary<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/films-videos-sound-recordings/rpm/Pages/image.aspx?Image=nlc008388.3911&URLjpg=http%3a%2f%2fwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca%2fobj%2f028020%2ff4%2fnlc008388.3911.gif&Ecopy=nlc008388.3911 |title=Image : RPM Weekly -

She eventually bought him a guitar which he taught himself to play as well.<ref name=\"Munly Syffal\">{{cite news |last1=Frieders |first1=Joel |title=Our Interview With Munly J.

It is a role that he is happy to take on by himself, believing that a band's success is dependent on playing to individual strengths rather than collaboration with members on each part of an album's creation.<ref name=\"DBUK Marquee\" /> He also says that he is \"selfish\" with his written material and serious about lyrical preservation.<ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\" />\n\nHe expanded on his way of songwriting in a 2019 interview with Sadwave, a Russian publication:\n\n{{quote|''\"From the very beginning, I understand where and why I'm writing a song. There is no complicated science. When you have been doing this for so many years, you bring the skill to automatism. I can start with a melody, but I can with a text \u2013 I always have a lot of words, I write a lot. I constantly find common themes in my songs, but I never had the feeling that I was working on a pattern. It would be immoral and unnatural, and I would not want to. I have characters who constantly come back, wander from song to song. But I try to change the angle, write on behalf of different people. On behalf of all sad people.\"''<ref name=\"Munly Sadwave\">{{cite news |last1=Kurkin |first1=Dmitry |title=Jay Manley [sic] (DBUK): 'I try to write on behalf of all sad people' |url=https://sadwave.com/2019/02/jay-munli/ |accessdate=April 5, 2020 |work=sad wave |date=February 8, 2019 |ref=Munly Sadwave}}</ref>}}\n\n===Musical themes and genres===\n\nHis music has ties to [[alt-country]] and [[Gothabilly|Gothic-Americana]]. Common themes include religion, violence and dysfunctional relationships; often they are intertwined. His increasingly narrative songs often feature banjo and, since the recording of his fourth album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', strings.\n\nOne topic that Munly deliberately does not write about is politics, since he \"hates\" music that veers into that kind of territory.<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /> However, he admits that the stories and songs that he writes can be applied to real-world events in a way that coincidentally fits.<ref name=\"DBUK Marquee\" />\n\nHis written works have been compared to that of: [[Edward Gorey]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[William Faulkner]], [[Charles Portis]], [[Flannery O'Connor]],<ref name=\"SC NARC\">{{cite news |last1=Fisher |first1=Lee |title=Interview: Slim Cessna's Auto Club |url=https://narcmagazine.com/slim-cessnas-auto-club/ |accessdate=18 April 2020 |work=NARC. |publisher=NARC Magazine |date=October 10, 2016 |ref=SC NARC}}</ref> [[Cormac McCarthy]], and [[Nick Cave]].\n\n===Vocals===\n\nTechnically, Munly is a baritone, but his [[vocal range]] extends from A1 to F5.<ref name=\"Munly Vocal Range 1\">{{cite news |title=Jay \"Munly\" Munly |url=https://therangeplanet.proboards.com/thread/14/jay-munly |accessdate=9 April 2020 |work=The Range Planet |date=September 22, 2019 |ref=Munly Vocal Range 1}}</ref> Audio samples can be found on Youtube.<ref name=\"Munly Vocal Range 2\">{{cite web |title=The Vocal Range of Jay Munly |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_hVoW0VwVA |via=YouTube |accessdate=April 9, 2020 |ref=Munly Vocal Range 2}}</ref> \n\nEarly on in his solo career, he sang at a higher register than what he usually sounds like on his later records. \n\nOn the expanded DVDs of ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004) and ''The Commandments According to SCAC'' (2016), Munly read the lyrics of each song as poetry, employing a wide range of voices to the characters in his songs.\n\n===Controversial lyrics===\n\nAs stated in a few interviews, people have found some of Munly's material controversial and politically incorrect. It is important to note that in most cases, the words and phrases used (as well as the views they represent) are that of the fictional characters that Munly creates, not of Munly himself.\n\nExamples:\n\n* ''\"Boys with tattoos can't be Jews\"'' \u2013 from \"Kidneys Running Dry\" on ''Blurry'' (1996)<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /><ref name=\"KRD Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Munly \u2013 Kidneys Running Dry |url=https://genius.com/Munly-kidneys-running-dry-lyrics?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=bd3ae05fe6c1e2a47c4f0713ffa5a16e71fce6fd-1586308658-0-AacccNM6Up3QUKAwcxWr7moI6buvh28pOpYPxYODrvwTY_F1arxPxbTRgSuWyl4Xdp0ySY_ZseZwWCStv8dumtz5AhmL5llOOnD9_3dv6-XTquwykYgduqCixdMk01PstYrSa8KQZi4SK3emYdNuLlbX4RFCHJbwQ1YRExOJjd6dkKD1_GHgcdfYYDe-vTJWI1uyX_0R8Q64ZevT3n-7A-7f2-ifsSZoF6J2JCq_RT2aMwKoWBxbHjarJrGdvNiZWwohYzH2ba2tN14wf2PwTXEzsdbFCgp-hDaOKuoeEYASB7ZBgYOJT_5LMn8GQ2PkKSfxVXNgggJO-I6ajZK3bMX27bSVAiYaqRheMbR_klyaHJvQPTQvRxAPyOR5CZ1c9A |website=Genius |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=KRD Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[a] ]]</sup>\n\n* \"My Darling Sambo\" \u2013 the first track title on ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'' (2002)<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" /><ref name=\"JCS Amazon\">{{cite web |title=MUNLY, JAY \u2013 Jimmy Carter Syndrome |url=https://www.amazon.com/Jimmy-Carter-Syndrome-JAY-MUNLY/dp/B000BKWZOI |website=Amazon Music |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=JCS Amazon}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[b] ]]</sup>\n\n* ''\"Paint your blackface/Yeah, won't you put me in your anteroom case/I'll be your n***er/On stage\"'' \u2013 from \"Censer from the Footlights\" on ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'' (2002)<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" /><ref name=\"CFTF Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Jay Munly \u2013 Censer from the Footlights Lyrics |url=http://www.songlyrics.com/jay-munly/censer-from-the-footlights-lyrics/ |website=SongLyrics |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=CFTF Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[c] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[d] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[e] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[f] ]]</sup>\n\n* ''\"Then we found ourselves a half-breed/To tell us our fortune today/He painted my hands a deep, dark red/Said 'now boy, you know that you gotta pay'\"'' \u2013 from \"Goose Walking Over My Grave\" on ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004)<ref name=\"Munly Birds\">{{cite news |last1=Bradley |first1=Lisa M. |title=A Crack in Its Speak: Fantastic Birds in the Gothic Country Lyrics of Jay Munly |url=http://stonetelling.com/issue8-aug2012/bradley-speak.html |accessdate=April 6, 2020 |work=Stone Telling |issue=Issue No. 8 |date=August 2012 |ref=Munly Birds}}</ref><ref name=\"Goose Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Lyrics \u2013 Goose Walking Over My Grave |url=https://www.musixmatch.com/lyrics/Munly-The-Lee-Lewis-Harlots/Goose-Walking-Over-My-Grave |website=Musixmatch |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=Goose Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[g] ]]</sup>\n\n* \"Cassius Castrato The She-Male of the Men's Prison\" \u2013 the fifth track title on ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004)<ref name=\"LLH Album\">{{cite web |title=Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots |url=https://slimcessnasautoclub.myshopify.com/collections/munly/products/munly-the-lee-lewis-harlots |website=slimcessnasautoclub.myshopify.com |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=LLH Album}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[h] ]]</sup>\n\n==Music career==\n\n===Solo career===\n\nIn the 1990s, Munly started out his music career as a solo artist. He had toured with The Reejers before releasing his first album. He also shared a 7-inch vinyl album with [[Roger Manning]].<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" />\n\nHe released his debut solo album, ''Blurry'', in 1996 through Top Notch, an imprint of [[What Are Records?]]. ''Munly de Dar He'' and ''Galvanized Yankee'' were also released through Top Notch in 1997 and 1999, respectively. His fourth and final solo album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', was released through [[Alternative Tentacles]] in 2002. Each of these albums were re-mastered by Bob Ferbrache and re-released as limited editions through Smooch Records in 2006. Only 1,000 copies of each were printed.\n\nHe has worked with several musicians that are featured on his albums, such as John Ellison of The Reejers and Chris Mars of The Replacements.<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /> However, he makes a point of not listing the exact musical contributions of each member in liner notes, preferring the simplicity of the 'Modern Library book' aesthetic.<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" />\n\nAlthough Munly is the primary vocalist and lyricist on each of his albums, he hesitates to call himself a \"singer-songwriter\":\n\n''{{quote|\"It's kind of rough being a solo artist.

I constantly find common themes in my songs, but I never had the feeling that I was working on a pattern. It would be immoral and unnatural, and I would not want to.

Common themes include religion, violence and dysfunctional relationships; often they are intertwined. His increasingly narrative songs often feature banjo and, since the recording of his fourth album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', strings.\n\nOne topic that Munly deliberately does not write about is politics, since he \"hates\" music that veers into that kind of territory.<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /> However, he admits that the stories and songs that he writes can be applied to real-world events in a way that coincidentally fits.<ref name=\"DBUK Marquee\" />\n\nHis written works have been compared to that of: [[Edward Gorey]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[William Faulkner]], [[Charles Portis]], [[Flannery O'Connor]],<ref name=\"SC NARC\">{{cite news |last1=Fisher |first1=Lee |title=Interview: Slim Cessna's Auto Club |url=https://narcmagazine.com/slim-cessnas-auto-club/ |accessdate=18 April 2020 |work=NARC. |publisher=NARC Magazine |date=October 10, 2016 |ref=SC NARC}}</ref> [[Cormac McCarthy]], and [[Nick Cave]].\n\n===Vocals===\n\nTechnically, Munly is a baritone, but his [[vocal range]] extends from A1 to F5.<ref name=\"Munly Vocal Range 1\">{{cite news |title=Jay \"Munly\" Munly |url=https://therangeplanet.proboards.com/thread/14/jay-munly |accessdate=9 April 2020 |work=The Range Planet |date=September 22, 2019 |ref=Munly Vocal Range 1}}</ref> Audio samples can be found on Youtube.<ref name=\"Munly Vocal Range 2\">{{cite web |title=The Vocal Range of Jay Munly |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_hVoW0VwVA |via=YouTube |accessdate=April 9, 2020 |ref=Munly Vocal Range 2}}</ref> \n\nEarly on in his solo career, he sang at a higher register than what he usually sounds like on his later records. \n\nOn the expanded DVDs of ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004) and ''The Commandments According to SCAC'' (2016), Munly read the lyrics of each song as poetry, employing a wide range of voices to the characters in his songs.\n\n===Controversial lyrics===\n\nAs stated in a few interviews, people have found some of Munly's material controversial and politically incorrect. It is important to note that in most cases, the words and phrases used (as well as the views they represent) are that of the fictional characters that Munly creates, not of Munly himself.\n\nExamples:\n\n* ''\"Boys with tattoos can't be Jews\"'' \u2013 from \"Kidneys Running Dry\" on ''Blurry'' (1996)<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /><ref name=\"KRD Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Munly \u2013 Kidneys Running Dry |url=https://genius.com/Munly-kidneys-running-dry-lyrics?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=bd3ae05fe6c1e2a47c4f0713ffa5a16e71fce6fd-1586308658-0-AacccNM6Up3QUKAwcxWr7moI6buvh28pOpYPxYODrvwTY_F1arxPxbTRgSuWyl4Xdp0ySY_ZseZwWCStv8dumtz5AhmL5llOOnD9_3dv6-XTquwykYgduqCixdMk01PstYrSa8KQZi4SK3emYdNuLlbX4RFCHJbwQ1YRExOJjd6dkKD1_GHgcdfYYDe-vTJWI1uyX_0R8Q64ZevT3n-7A-7f2-ifsSZoF6J2JCq_RT2aMwKoWBxbHjarJrGdvNiZWwohYzH2ba2tN14wf2PwTXEzsdbFCgp-hDaOKuoeEYASB7ZBgYOJT_5LMn8GQ2PkKSfxVXNgggJO-I6ajZK3bMX27bSVAiYaqRheMbR_klyaHJvQPTQvRxAPyOR5CZ1c9A |website=Genius |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=KRD Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[a] ]]</sup>\n\n* \"My Darling Sambo\" \u2013 the first track title on ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'' (2002)<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" /><ref name=\"JCS Amazon\">{{cite web |title=MUNLY, JAY \u2013 Jimmy Carter Syndrome |url=https://www.amazon.com/Jimmy-Carter-Syndrome-JAY-MUNLY/dp/B000BKWZOI |website=Amazon Music |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=JCS Amazon}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[b] ]]</sup>\n\n* ''\"Paint your blackface/Yeah, won't you put me in your anteroom case/I'll be your n***er/On stage\"'' \u2013 from \"Censer from the Footlights\" on ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'' (2002)<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" /><ref name=\"CFTF Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Jay Munly \u2013 Censer from the Footlights Lyrics |url=http://www.songlyrics.com/jay-munly/censer-from-the-footlights-lyrics/ |website=SongLyrics |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=CFTF Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[c] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[d] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[e] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[f] ]]</sup>\n\n* ''\"Then we found ourselves a half-breed/To tell us our fortune today/He painted my hands a deep, dark red/Said 'now boy, you know that you gotta pay'\"'' \u2013 from \"Goose Walking Over My Grave\" on ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004)<ref name=\"Munly Birds\">{{cite news |last1=Bradley |first1=Lisa M. |title=A Crack in Its Speak: Fantastic Birds in the Gothic Country Lyrics of Jay Munly |url=http://stonetelling.com/issue8-aug2012/bradley-speak.html |accessdate=April 6, 2020 |work=Stone Telling |issue=Issue No. 8 |date=August 2012 |ref=Munly Birds}}</ref><ref name=\"Goose Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Lyrics \u2013 Goose Walking Over My Grave |url=https://www.musixmatch.com/lyrics/Munly-The-Lee-Lewis-Harlots/Goose-Walking-Over-My-Grave |website=Musixmatch |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=Goose Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[g] ]]</sup>\n\n* \"Cassius Castrato The She-Male of the Men's Prison\" \u2013 the fifth track title on ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004)<ref name=\"LLH Album\">{{cite web |title=Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots |url=https://slimcessnasautoclub.myshopify.com/collections/munly/products/munly-the-lee-lewis-harlots |website=slimcessnasautoclub.myshopify.com |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=LLH Album}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[h] ]]</sup>\n\n==Music career==\n\n===Solo career===\n\nIn the 1990s, Munly started out his music career as a solo artist.

''Munly de Dar He'' and ''Galvanized Yankee'' were also released through Top Notch in 1997 and 1999, respectively. His fourth and final solo album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', was released through [[Alternative Tentacles]] in 2002.

It was released as a [[double album]] on 24 February 1975 by the group's new record label, [[Swan Song Records]].\n\nThe band wrote and recorded eight new songs for the album in early 1974 at [[Headley Grange]], a country house in [[Hampshire]], which gave them ample time to improvise arrangements and experiment with recording. The total playing time covered three sides of an LP, so they decided to expand it into a double by including previously unreleased tracks from the sessions for the earlier albums ''[[Led Zeppelin III]]'', ''[[Led Zeppelin IV]]'' and ''[[Houses of the Holy]]''. The album covered a range of styles including [[hard rock]], [[progressive rock]], [[rock 'n' roll]] and [[folk music|folk]]. The album was then mixed over summer 1974 and planned for an end-of year release. It was delayed because of the sleeve, which was designed by [[Peter Corriston]] and featured a theme around a [[tenement]] block in [[Manhattan]], New York City.\n\n''Physical Graffiti'' was commercially and critically successful upon its release and debuted at number one on album charts in the UK and number three in the US.<ref>\n{{cite magazine\n| author = Billboard\n| date = March 15, 1975\n| title = Top LPs & Tape\n| magazine = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]\n| volume = 87\n| issue = 10\n| issn = 0006-2510\n| ref = harv\n| page = 86\n}}</ref> It was promoted by a successful US tour and a five-night residency at [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre|Earl's Court]], London, and has since been viewed as one of the group's strongest albums and the artistic peak of their career. The album has been reissued on CD several times, including an expansive 40th anniversary edition in 2015. ''Physical Graffiti'' was later certified [[RIAA certification|16x platinum]] in the United States by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) in 2006, signifying shipments of over eight million copies.\n\n==Recording==\nThe first attempt by Led Zeppelin to record songs for ''Physical Graffiti'' took place in November 1973 at [[Headley Grange]] in [[Hampshire]], England, where they had previously recorded their [[Led Zeppelin IV|untitled fourth album]]. The recording equipment consisted of [[Ronnie Lane's Mobile Studio]]. Guitarist and producer [[Jimmy Page]] and drummer [[John Bonham]] recorded an instrumental which was later reworked as \"Kashmir\" during this visit. However, these sessions came to a halt quickly and the studio time was turned over to [[Bad Company]], who used it to record songs for [[Bad Company (album)|their eponymous debut album]].{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=17,89}} The press reported that bassist/keyboardist [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] was ill and unable to record.<ref name=cameroncrowe>{{cite web |url=http://www.cameroncrowe.com/journalism/articles/crowe_eyesandears_journalism_led.html |title=Cameron Crowe interview Led Zeppelin |accessdate=16 September 2018 |date=18 March 1975 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024124033/http://www.cameroncrowe.com/journalism/articles/crowe_eyesandears_journalism_led.html |archivedate=24 October 2007 }}</ref> However, he became disillusioned with the group and fed up with touring, and told manager [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]] he was considering quitting.{{efn|Jones later joked that he had considered becoming the choirmaster at [[Winchester Cathedral]] had he left Led Zeppelin in 1973.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/20-things-you-didnt-know-john-paul-jones-did-227646/ |title=20 Things You Didn't Know John Paul Jones Did |first=Corbin |last=Reiff |journal=Rolling Stone |date=18 March 2016 |accessdate=5 July 2018}}</ref>}} Grant asked him to reconsider and take the rest of the year off to recuperate.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=17}}\n\nThe group reconvened at Headley Grange in January and February 1974, where they recorded eight tracks engineered by [[Ron Nevison]].{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=17\u201318}} Lead singer [[Robert Plant]] later referred to these eight tracks as \"the belters\", including \"off-the-wall stuff that turned out really nice\".{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=18}} As with previous sessions at Headley Grange, the informal atmosphere allowed the group to improvise and develop material while recording. Sometimes the group would rehearse or record a track several times, discuss what went wrong or what could be improved and then realised they had worked out an alternative arrangement for it which was better. Bonham was a driving force at the sessions, regularly suggesting ideas or the best ways in which a complicated arrangement could be played successfully. This led to him getting a lead songwriting credit on several tracks.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=21}}\n\nThe eight songs extended beyond the length of a conventional album, spanning three sides of an LP, so the group decided to create a [[double album]], adding material they had recorded for previous albums but never issued. This included various jam sessions such as \"Boogie With Stu\", which Page thought would be unsuitable as a track on a single album.<ref name=Schulps>{{cite journal |first=Dave |last=Schulps |url=http://www.iem.ac.ru/zeppelin/docs/interviews/page_77.trp |title=Interview with Jimmy Page |journal=[[Trouser Press]] |date=October 1977}}</ref> Additional overdubs were laid down, and the final mixing of the album was performed in July 1974 by [[Keith Harwood]] at [[Olympic Studios]], London. The title \"Physical Graffiti\" was coined by Page to illustrate the whole physical and written energy that had gone into producing the set.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=55}}\n\n==Songs==\n[[File:Bron-y-aur - geograph.org.uk - 21107 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|[[Bron-Yr-Aur]] cottage was the birthplace of \"[[The Rover (Led Zeppelin song)|The Rover]]\", \"[[Bron-Yr-Aur (song)|Bron-Yr-Aur]]\", and \"[[Down by the Seaside]]\".]]\nThe album spanned several years of recording and covered a range of musical styles, including hard rock (\"Custard Pie\", \"[[The Rover (Led Zeppelin song)|The Rover]]\", \"[[The Wanton Song]]\", \"[[Sick Again]]\", \"[[Houses of the Holy (song)|Houses of the Holy]]\"), eastern-influenced orchestral rock (\"[[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]]\"), progressive rock (\"[[In the Light]]\"), driving funk (\"[[Trampled Under Foot]]\"), acoustic rock and roll (\"Boogie with Stu\", \"Black Country Woman\"), love ballad (\"[[Ten Years Gone]]\"), blues rock (\"[[In My Time of Dying#Led Zeppelin version|In My Time of Dying]]\"), soft rock (\"Down by the Seaside\"), country rock romp (\"Night Flight\"), and acoustic guitar instrumental (\"Bron-Yr-Aur\").{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=54\u201356}}<ref name=AMG>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r11465|pure_url=yes}} Review at Allmusic]</ref><ref name=\"Rolling Stone Magazine 2\">{{cite journal|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/ledzeppelin/albums/album/158693/review/5944206/physical_graffiti|title=Physical Graffiti|journal=Rolling Stone|date=27 March 1975|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306030326/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/ledzeppelin/albums/album/158693/review/5944206/physical_graffiti%3B|archivedate=6 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nSeveral tracks from the album became live staples at [[Led Zeppelin concerts]]. In particular, \"In My Time of Dying\", \"Trampled Under Foot\", \"Kashmir\", \"Ten Years Gone\", \"Black Country Woman\", and \"Sick Again\" became regular components of the band's live concert [[set list]]s following the release of the album.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=55\u201356}}{{sfn|Lewis|2010|p=114}}\n\n===Side one===\n\"Custard Pie\" was recorded at Headley Grange in early 1974. The first take was played at a faster tempo than the finished version, with various improvised vocals. After a basic run-through, the group then discussed possibilities for rearranging it.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=21}} Page played the guitar solo through an ARP synthesiser, while Jones overdubbed a [[Hohner Clavinet]] part and Plant played harmonica.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=55}}\n\n\"[[The Rover (Led Zeppelin song)|The Rover]]\" was written in 1970 at [[Bron-Yr-Aur]], a cottage near [[Machynlleth]], [[Wales]]. It was first recorded at Headley Grange in May 1970 as an acoustic number for ''[[Led Zeppelin III]]''. It was reworked as an electric number in 1972 for ''[[Houses of the Holy]]'', which formed the basis for the backing track.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=19}} Page subsequently added guitar overdubs in 1974 with Keith Harwood engineering.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=55}}{{efn|The original sleeve features the credit \"Guitar lost by Nevison, salvaged by the grace of Harwood\" and refers to the various recording sessions for the track.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=55}}}}\n\n\"[[In My Time of Dying#Led Zeppelin version|In My Time of Dying]]\" is based on a traditional song that [[Bob Dylan]] recorded on his [[Bob Dylan (album)|debut album]] in 1962.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=55}} The track was recorded live, with Page later adding further [[slide guitar]] overdubs. The arranging and structuring was led by Bonham, who worked out where the various stop / start sections in the track should be, and how the group would know where to come back in. The very end of the song features his off-mic cough, causing the rest of the group to break down at that point. Bonham subsequently shouted \"That's got to be the one, hasn't it?\", feeling it was the best take.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=22,55}} It was left on the album to show fans that Led Zeppelin were a working band that took care in their recordings.{{sfn|Williamson|2007|p=234}}\n\n===Side two===\n\"Houses of the Holy\" was recorded as the title track for the album of the same name in June 1972 at [[Electric Lady Studios]] with [[Eddie Kramer]] engineering. It was left off that album because of its similarity to other tracks such as \"Dancing Days\", which were felt to be better. Unlike some of the other older material on ''Physical Graffiti'', it required no further overdubbing or remixing.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=55}}\n\n\"[[Trampled Under Foot]]\" developed from a jam session driven by Jones at the Clavinet. The song went through several arrangement changes before arriving at the version heard on the album, with the group rehearsing various different ideas and arguing about the overall style. Bonham decided the track was too \"souly\" and rearranged it into a funk style, suggesting that Page should play a guitar riff throughout in place of chords.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=21\u201322}} The lyrics are a series of [[double entendres]] around driving and cars. The song quickly became a popular live piece that was played at every live show from 1975 onwards, and was later revived by Plant for his solo tours.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=55}} It was released as a single in the US on 2 April (with \"Black Country Woman\" as the B-side) and was a top 40 hit.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=95}}\n\n\"[[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]]\" was an idea from Page and Bonham, and was first attempted as an instrumental demo in late 1973. Plant wrote the lyrics while on holiday in Morocco. Jones played [[Mellotron]] on the track, and arranged strings and brass parts that were played by session musicians. The song was one of the most critically acclaimed on the album, and was played at every gig from 1975 onwards.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=55\u201356}} Page and Plant played it on their 1994 tour,{{sfn|Lewis|2010|p=342}} and it was reworked in 1998 by [[Sean Combs|Sean \"Puffy\" Combs]] for his single \"[[Come with Me (Puff Daddy song)|Come With Me]]\" which featured Page on guitar.<ref>{{cite book|title=Dancing with the Devil: How Puff Burned the Bad Boys of Hip-hop|first=Mark|last=Curry|p=101|publisher=NewMark Books|year=2009|isbn=978-0-615-27650-2}}</ref>\n\n===Side three===\n\"In the Light\" was recorded at Headley Grange in early 1974. It was initially called \"In the Morning\" and went through several rehearsals and takes to work out a basic structure. A drone / chant introduction was later added to the piece.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=21,56}}\n\n\"Bron-Yr-Aur\" was a solo acoustic piece by Page, named after the cottage where he had composed and arranged much of ''Led Zeppelin III'' with Plant. It was recorded at Island Studios in mid-1970. The track was later used as background music in the group's film ''The Song Remains the Same''.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=56}}\n\n\"Down by the Seaside\" was originally written as an acoustic track at Bron-Yr-Aur in 1970, and was influenced by [[Neil Young]]. It was reworked as an electric track during sessions for the fourth album the following year. Page and Bonham led the arranging, changing tempo from the slow to fast section and then back again.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=56}}\n\n\"Ten Years Gone\" was mostly composed by Plant about an old love affair, and was combined with an instrumental piece from Page, featuring overdubbed electric and acoustic guitar parts. When the track was performed live, Jones played a triple-neck guitar featuring mandolin, six- and twelve-string guitars, in order to try to reproduce the various guitar overdubs on the studio recording.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=56}}\n\n===Side four===\n[[File:Stargrove - geograph.org.uk - 62433.jpg|thumb|Some older material for ''Physical Graffiti'' was recorded at [[Stargroves]].]]\n\"Night Flight\" was recorded at Headley Grange in 1971 for the fourth album. Jones plays [[Hammond organ]] on the track, and Page plays guitar through a [[Leslie speaker]].{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=56}} Plant wrote the lyrics after reading a news headline entitled \"Nuclear Damage Test Threat\" and wondered why there seemed to be little peace and love in the world.{{sfn|Lewis|2010|p=85}}\n\n\"The Wanton Song\" was built around a Page guitar riff. Unlike some of the other tracks recorded at the 1974 Headley Grange sessions, it was straightforward to arrange, with the group building the song around the riffs.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=56}}\n\n\"Boogie with Stu\" was a jam session with [[Rolling Stones]] pianist [[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]] based around the [[Ritchie Valens]] song \"Ooh My Head\".{{efn|The track is co-credited to \"Mrs. Valens\", a reference to Ritchie's mother. The credit came about after the band had heard she never received any royalties from her son's hits.{{sfn|Williamson|2007|p=179}}}} It was recorded in 1971 at Headley Grange during the same session that produced \"Rock and Roll\" for the fourth album.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=56}} It did not credit Valens or [[Bob Keane]], instead crediting Valens' mother. Eventually, a lawsuit was filed by Keane, and half of the award went to Valens' mother, although she was not part of the suit.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lehmer|first=Larry|title=The Day the Music Died: The Last Tour of Buddy Holly, the Big Bopper and Ritchie Valens|year=2004|p=166|publisher=Schirmer|isbn=978-0-825-67287-3}}</ref>\n\n\"Black Country Woman\" was recorded in the garden at Stargroves in 1972 for ''Houses of the Holy'', as part of the group's desire to work in \"off the wall\" locations outside a traditional studio environment. The track was nearly abandoned when an aeroplane cruised overhead, but it was left on the final recording for effect.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=56}}\n\n\"Sick Again\" was written by Page and Plant about the 1973 tour and their experience with meeting [[groupie]]s. The track was driven by Bonham's drumming and Page's guitar riffs.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=56}} The arrangement had been worked out before recording, and was straightforward to put down on tape.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=21}}\n\n===Unreleased material===\nAs ''Physical Graffiti'' collected various out-takes from earlier albums, little was left over from the recording sessions that was not eventually released. An early arrangement of \"Custard Pie\", different from the final version, was reworked as \"Hots on For Nowhere\" on the following album, ''[[Presence (album)|Presence]]''.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=57}} A number of other outtakes from earlier album sessions that had not been put on ''Physical Graffiti'' were later included on the 1982 album ''[[Coda (album)|Coda]]''.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=62}}\n\n==Artwork and packaging==\n[[File:Physical Led Zeppelin.jpg|thumb|right|upright|96 and 98 East [[8th Street / St. Mark's Place (Manhattan)]]]]\nThe album was originally released with a die-cut sleeve design depicting a New York City [[tenement]] block, through whose windows various cultural icons could be interchangeably viewed.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=67}} The album designer, [[Peter Corriston]], was looking for a building that was symmetrical with interesting details, that was not obstructed by other objects and would fit the square album cover. He subsequently came up with the rest of the cover based on people moving in and out of the tenement, with various sleeves that could be placed under the main cover and filling the windows with various pieces of information.<ref name=\"Led Zeppelin\">{{cite news |url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B04E6D6123EF93BA3575AC0A9649C8B63|work=The New York Times |title=F.Y.I.|accessdate=15 March 2008 | first=Ed | last=Boland Jr. | date=8 September 2002}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe two five-storey buildings photographed for the album cover are located at 96 and 98 [[St. Mark's Place]] in New York City.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=55}} The original photograph underwent a number of tweaks to arrive at the final image. The fifth floor of the building had to be cropped out to fit the square album cover format.<ref name=\"Led Zeppelin\" />\n\nEschewing the usual [[gatefold]] design in favour of a special die-cut cover, the original album jacket included four covers made up of two inners (for each disc), a middle insert cover and an outer cover. The middle insert cover is white and details all the album track listings and recording information. The outer cover has die-cut windows on the building, so when the middle cover is wrapped around the inner covers and slid into the outer cover, the title of the album is shown on the front cover, spelling out the name \"Physical Graffiti\".{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=55}} Images in the windows touched upon a set of American icons and a range of Hollywood ephemera. Pictures of [[W. C. Fields]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]] alternated with the snapshots of Led Zeppelin.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=67}} Photographs of [[Lee Harvey Oswald]], [[Marcel Duchamp]] and [[Pope Leo XIII]] are also featured. \nPer the liner notes, package concept and design was by AGI/Mike Doud (London) and Peter Corriston (New York).

However, it was done without input from the band, used second and third-generation master tapes, and accidentally edited off the studio banter at the end of \"In My Time of Dying\". Page was unhappy with the lack of care over the CDs and decided he would produce new versions himself. He booked a week in May 1990 with engineer George Marino to remaster the entire back catalogue.  Eight tracks from ''Physical Graffiti'' appeared on the four-disc ''[[Led Zeppelin Boxed Set|Boxed Set]]'' and three on ''[[Led Zeppelin Remasters|Remasters]]'', both in 1990;{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=85,95}} the remainder appeared on ''[[Led Zeppelin Boxed Set 2|Boxed Set 2]]'' in 1993, while the album proper was reissued in 1994.<ref name=CD>{{cite AV media notes|title=Physical Graffiti|publisher=Swan Song|year=1994|id=7567-92442-2}}</ref>\n\nAn extended remastered version of ''Physical Graffiti'' was reissued on 23 February 2015, almost exactly forty years after the original album was released. The reissue comes in six formats: a standard two-CD edition, a deluxe three-CD edition, a standard two-LP version, a deluxe three-LP version, a super deluxe three-CD plus three-LP version with a hardback book, and as high resolution 96k/24-bit digital downloads. The deluxe and super deluxe editions feature bonus material containing alternative takes and arrangements of songs. The reissue was released with an altered colour version of the original album's artwork as its bonus disc's cover.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bennett|first=Ross|date=12 January 2014|url=http://www.mojo4music.com/18416/led-zeppelin-mark-physical-graffitis-40th-anniversary-reissue/|title=Led Zeppelin Mark Physical Graffiti's 40th With Reissue|work=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]|accessdate=14 January 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150115050859/http://www.mojo4music.com/18416/led-zeppelin-mark-physical-graffitis-40th-anniversary-reissue/|archivedate=15 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Track listing==\n{{Track listing\n| headline = Side one<ref name=CD/>\n| all_writing = [[Jimmy Page]] and [[Robert Plant]], except where noted\n| extra_column = Date and location\n| title1 = Custard Pie\n| extra1 =  January\u2013February 1974, [[Headley Grange]], [[Hampshire]]\n| length1 = 4:13\n| title2 = [[The Rover (Led Zeppelin song)|The Rover]]\n| extra2 =  May 1972, Stargroves {{small|(''[[Houses of the Holy]]'' outtake)}}\n| length2 = 5:36\n| title3 = [[In My Time of Dying#Led Zeppelin version|In My Time of Dying]]\n| note3 = <small>[[John Bonham]], [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]], Page, Plant</small>\n| extra3 =  January\u2013February 1974, Headley Grange\n| length3 = 11:04\n}}\n{{Track listing\n| headline = Side two\n| extra_column =  Date recorded\n| title1 = [[Houses of the Holy (song)|Houses of the Holy]]\n| extra1 =  May 1972, [[Olympic Studios]], London {{small|(''Houses of the Holy'' outtake)}}\n| length1 = 4:01\n| title2 = [[Trampled Under Foot]]\n| note2 = <small>Jones, Page, Plant</small>\n| extra2 =  January\u2013February 1974, Headley Grange\n| length2 = 5:35\n| title3 = [[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]]\n| note3 = <small>Bonham, Page, Plant</small>\n| extra3 =  January\u2013February 1974, Headley Grange\n| length3 = 8:37{{efn|The running times listed for \"Kashmir\" and \"Ten Years Gone\" on original LP pressings, and some compact disc versions, of the album were significantly in error;

It was released as a [[double album]] on 24 February 1975 by the group's new record label, [[Swan Song Records]].\n\nThe band wrote and recorded eight new songs for the album in early 1974 at [[Headley Grange]], a country house in [[Hampshire]], which gave them ample time to improvise arrangements and experiment with recording. The total playing time covered three sides of an LP, so they decided to expand it into a double by including previously unreleased tracks from the sessions for the earlier albums ''[[Led Zeppelin III]]'', ''[[Led Zeppelin IV]]'' and ''[[Houses of the Holy]]''. The album covered a range of styles including [[hard rock]], [[progressive rock]], [[rock 'n' roll]] and [[folk music|folk]]. The album was then mixed over summer 1974 and planned for an end-of year release. It was delayed because of the sleeve, which was designed by [[Peter Corriston]] and featured a theme around a [[tenement]] block in [[Manhattan]], New York City.\n\n''Physical Graffiti'' was commercially and critically successful upon its release and debuted at number one on album charts in the UK and number three in the US.<ref>\n{{cite magazine\n| author = Billboard\n| date = March 15, 1975\n| title = Top LPs & Tape\n| magazine = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]\n| volume = 87\n| issue = 10\n| issn = 0006-2510\n| ref = harv\n| page = 86\n}}</ref> It was promoted by a successful US tour and a five-night residency at [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre|Earl's Court]], London, and has since been viewed as one of the group's strongest albums and the artistic peak of their career. The album has been reissued on CD several times, including an expansive 40th anniversary edition in 2015. ''Physical Graffiti'' was later certified [[RIAA certification|16x platinum]] in the United States by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) in 2006, signifying shipments of over eight million copies.\n\n==Recording==\nThe first attempt by Led Zeppelin to record songs for ''Physical Graffiti'' took place in November 1973 at [[Headley Grange]] in [[Hampshire]], England, where they had previously recorded their [[Led Zeppelin IV|untitled fourth album]]. The recording equipment consisted of [[Ronnie Lane's Mobile Studio]]. Guitarist and producer [[Jimmy Page]] and drummer [[John Bonham]] recorded an instrumental which was later reworked as \"Kashmir\" during this visit. However, these sessions came to a halt quickly and the studio time was turned over to [[Bad Company]], who used it to record songs for [[Bad Company (album)|their eponymous debut album]].{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=17,89}} The press reported that bassist/keyboardist [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] was ill and unable to record.<ref name=cameroncrowe>{{cite web |url=http://www.cameroncrowe.com/journalism/articles/crowe_eyesandears_journalism_led.html |title=Cameron Crowe interview Led Zeppelin |accessdate=16 September 2018 |date=18 March 1975 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024124033/http://www.cameroncrowe.com/journalism/articles/crowe_eyesandears_journalism_led.html |archivedate=24 October 2007 }}</ref> However, he became disillusioned with the group and fed up with touring, and told manager [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]] he was considering quitting.{{efn|Jones later joked that he had considered becoming the choirmaster at [[Winchester Cathedral]] had he left Led Zeppelin in 1973.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/20-things-you-didnt-know-john-paul-jones-did-227646/ |title=20 Things You Didn't Know John Paul Jones Did |first=Corbin |last=Reiff |journal=Rolling Stone |date=18 March 2016 |accessdate=5 July 2018}}</ref>}} Grant asked him to reconsider and take the rest of the year off to recuperate.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=17}}\n\nThe group reconvened at Headley Grange in January and February 1974, where they recorded eight tracks engineered by [[Ron Nevison]].{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=17\u201318}} Lead singer [[Robert Plant]] later referred to these eight tracks as \"the belters\", including \"off-the-wall stuff that turned out really nice\".{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=18}} As with previous sessions at Headley Grange, the informal atmosphere allowed the group to improvise and develop material while recording. Sometimes the group would rehearse or record a track several times, discuss what went wrong or what could be improved and then realised they had worked out an alternative arrangement for it which was better. Bonham was a driving force at the sessions, regularly suggesting ideas or the best ways in which a complicated arrangement could be played successfully. This led to him getting a lead songwriting credit on several tracks.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=21}}\n\nThe eight songs extended beyond the length of a conventional album, spanning three sides of an LP, so the group decided to create a [[double album]], adding material they had recorded for previous albums but never issued. This included various jam sessions such as \"Boogie With Stu\", which Page thought would be unsuitable as a track on a single album.<ref name=Schulps>{{cite journal |first=Dave |last=Schulps |url=http://www.iem.ac.ru/zeppelin/docs/interviews/page_77.trp |title=Interview with Jimmy Page |journal=[[Trouser Press]] |date=October 1977}}</ref> Additional overdubs were laid down, and the final mixing of the album was performed in July 1974 by [[Keith Harwood]] at [[Olympic Studios]], London. The title \"Physical Graffiti\" was coined by Page to illustrate the whole physical and written energy that had gone into producing the set.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=55}}\n\n==Songs==\n[[File:Bron-y-aur - geograph.org.uk - 21107 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|[[Bron-Yr-Aur]] cottage was the birthplace of \"[[The Rover (Led Zeppelin song)|The Rover]]\", \"[[Bron-Yr-Aur (song)|Bron-Yr-Aur]]\", and \"[[Down by the Seaside]]\".]]\nThe album spanned several years of recording and covered a range of musical styles, including hard rock (\"Custard Pie\", \"[[The Rover (Led Zeppelin song)|The Rover]]\", \"[[The Wanton Song]]\", \"[[Sick Again]]\", \"[[Houses of the Holy (song)|Houses of the Holy]]\"), eastern-influenced orchestral rock (\"[[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]]\"), progressive rock (\"[[In the Light]]\"), driving funk (\"[[Trampled Under Foot]]\"), acoustic rock and roll (\"Boogie with Stu\", \"Black Country Woman\"), love ballad (\"[[Ten Years Gone]]\"), blues rock (\"[[In My Time of Dying#Led Zeppelin version|In My Time of Dying]]\"), soft rock (\"Down by the Seaside\"), country rock romp (\"Night Flight\"), and acoustic guitar instrumental (\"Bron-Yr-Aur\").{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=54\u201356}}<ref name=AMG>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r11465|pure_url=yes}} Review at Allmusic]</ref><ref name=\"Rolling Stone Magazine 2\">{{cite journal|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/ledzeppelin/albums/album/158693/review/5944206/physical_graffiti|title=Physical Graffiti|journal=Rolling Stone|date=27 March 1975|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306030326/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/ledzeppelin/albums/album/158693/review/5944206/physical_graffiti%3B|archivedate=6 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nSeveral tracks from the album became live staples at [[Led Zeppelin concerts]]. In particular, \"In My Time of Dying\", \"Trampled Under Foot\", \"Kashmir\", \"Ten Years Gone\", \"Black Country Woman\", and \"Sick Again\" became regular components of the band's live concert [[set list]]s following the release of the album.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=55\u201356}}{{sfn|Lewis|2010|p=114}}\n\n===Side one===\n\"Custard Pie\" was recorded at Headley Grange in early 1974. The first take was played at a faster tempo than the finished version, with various improvised vocals. After a basic run-through, the group then discussed possibilities for rearranging it.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=21}} Page played the guitar solo through an ARP synthesiser, while Jones overdubbed a [[Hohner Clavinet]] part and Plant played harmonica.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=55}}\n\n\"[[The Rover (Led Zeppelin song)|The Rover]]\" was written in 1970 at [[Bron-Yr-Aur]], a cottage near [[Machynlleth]], [[Wales]]. It was first recorded at Headley Grange in May 1970 as an acoustic number for ''[[Led Zeppelin III]]''. It was reworked as an electric number in 1972 for ''[[Houses of the Holy]]'', which formed the basis for the backing track.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=19}} Page subsequently added guitar overdubs in 1974 with Keith Harwood engineering.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=55}}{{efn|The original sleeve features the credit \"Guitar lost by Nevison, salvaged by the grace of Harwood\" and refers to the various recording sessions for the track.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=55}}}}\n\n\"[[In My Time of Dying#Led Zeppelin version|In My Time of Dying]]\" is based on a traditional song that [[Bob Dylan]] recorded on his [[Bob Dylan (album)|debut album]] in 1962.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=55}} The track was recorded live, with Page later adding further [[slide guitar]] overdubs. The arranging and structuring was led by Bonham, who worked out where the various stop / start sections in the track should be, and how the group would know where to come back in. The very end of the song features his off-mic cough, causing the rest of the group to break down at that point. Bonham subsequently shouted \"That's got to be the one, hasn't it?\", feeling it was the best take.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=22,55}} It was left on the album to show fans that Led Zeppelin were a working band that took care in their recordings.{{sfn|Williamson|2007|p=234}}\n\n===Side two===\n\"Houses of the Holy\" was recorded as the title track for the album of the same name in June 1972 at [[Electric Lady Studios]] with [[Eddie Kramer]] engineering. It was left off that album because of its similarity to other tracks such as \"Dancing Days\", which were felt to be better. Unlike some of the other older material on ''Physical Graffiti'', it required no further overdubbing or remixing.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=55}}\n\n\"[[Trampled Under Foot]]\" developed from a jam session driven by Jones at the Clavinet. The song went through several arrangement changes before arriving at the version heard on the album, with the group rehearsing various different ideas and arguing about the overall style. Bonham decided the track was too \"souly\" and rearranged it into a funk style, suggesting that Page should play a guitar riff throughout in place of chords.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=21\u201322}} The lyrics are a series of [[double entendres]] around driving and cars. The song quickly became a popular live piece that was played at every live show from 1975 onwards, and was later revived by Plant for his solo tours.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=55}} It was released as a single in the US on 2 April (with \"Black Country Woman\" as the B-side) and was a top 40 hit.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=95}}\n\n\"[[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]]\" was an idea from Page and Bonham, and was first attempted as an instrumental demo in late 1973. Plant wrote the lyrics while on holiday in Morocco. Jones played [[Mellotron]] on the track, and arranged strings and brass parts that were played by session musicians. The song was one of the most critically acclaimed on the album, and was played at every gig from 1975 onwards.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=55\u201356}} Page and Plant played it on their 1994 tour,{{sfn|Lewis|2010|p=342}} and it was reworked in 1998 by [[Sean Combs|Sean \"Puffy\" Combs]] for his single \"[[Come with Me (Puff Daddy song)|Come With Me]]\" which featured Page on guitar.<ref>{{cite book|title=Dancing with the Devil: How Puff Burned the Bad Boys of Hip-hop|first=Mark|last=Curry|p=101|publisher=NewMark Books|year=2009|isbn=978-0-615-27650-2}}</ref>\n\n===Side three===\n\"In the Light\" was recorded at Headley Grange in early 1974. It was initially called \"In the Morning\" and went through several rehearsals and takes to work out a basic structure. A drone / chant introduction was later added to the piece.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=21,56}}\n\n\"Bron-Yr-Aur\" was a solo acoustic piece by Page, named after the cottage where he had composed and arranged much of ''Led Zeppelin III'' with Plant. It was recorded at Island Studios in mid-1970. The track was later used as background music in the group's film ''The Song Remains the Same''.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=56}}\n\n\"Down by the Seaside\" was originally written as an acoustic track at Bron-Yr-Aur in 1970, and was influenced by [[Neil Young]]. It was reworked as an electric track during sessions for the fourth album the following year. Page and Bonham led the arranging, changing tempo from the slow to fast section and then back again.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=56}}\n\n\"Ten Years Gone\" was mostly composed by Plant about an old love affair, and was combined with an instrumental piece from Page, featuring overdubbed electric and acoustic guitar parts. When the track was performed live, Jones played a triple-neck guitar featuring mandolin, six- and twelve-string guitars, in order to try to reproduce the various guitar overdubs on the studio recording.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=56}}\n\n===Side four===\n[[File:Stargrove - geograph.org.uk - 62433.jpg|thumb|Some older material for ''Physical Graffiti'' was recorded at [[Stargroves]].]]\n\"Night Flight\" was recorded at Headley Grange in 1971 for the fourth album. Jones plays [[Hammond organ]] on the track, and Page plays guitar through a [[Leslie speaker]].{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=56}} Plant wrote the lyrics after reading a news headline entitled \"Nuclear Damage Test Threat\" and wondered why there seemed to be little peace and love in the world.{{sfn|Lewis|2010|p=85}}\n\n\"The Wanton Song\" was built around a Page guitar riff. Unlike some of the other tracks recorded at the 1974 Headley Grange sessions, it was straightforward to arrange, with the group building the song around the riffs.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=56}}\n\n\"Boogie with Stu\" was a jam session with [[Rolling Stones]] pianist [[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]] based around the [[Ritchie Valens]] song \"Ooh My Head\".{{efn|The track is co-credited to \"Mrs. Valens\", a reference to Ritchie's mother. The credit came about after the band had heard she never received any royalties from her son's hits.{{sfn|Williamson|2007|p=179}}}} It was recorded in 1971 at Headley Grange during the same session that produced \"Rock and Roll\" for the fourth album.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=56}} It did not credit Valens or [[Bob Keane]], instead crediting Valens' mother. Eventually, a lawsuit was filed by Keane, and half of the award went to Valens' mother, although she was not part of the suit.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lehmer|first=Larry|title=The Day the Music Died: The Last Tour of Buddy Holly, the Big Bopper and Ritchie Valens|year=2004|p=166|publisher=Schirmer|isbn=978-0-825-67287-3}}</ref>\n\n\"Black Country Woman\" was recorded in the garden at Stargroves in 1972 for ''Houses of the Holy'', as part of the group's desire to work in \"off the wall\" locations outside a traditional studio environment. The track was nearly abandoned when an aeroplane cruised overhead, but it was left on the final recording for effect.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=56}}\n\n\"Sick Again\" was written by Page and Plant about the 1973 tour and their experience with meeting [[groupie]]s. The track was driven by Bonham's drumming and Page's guitar riffs.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=56}} The arrangement had been worked out before recording, and was straightforward to put down on tape.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=21}}\n\n===Unreleased material===\nAs ''Physical Graffiti'' collected various out-takes from earlier albums, little was left over from the recording sessions that was not eventually released. An early arrangement of \"Custard Pie\", different from the final version, was reworked as \"Hots on For Nowhere\" on the following album, ''[[Presence (album)|Presence]]''.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=57}} A number of other outtakes from earlier album sessions that had not been put on ''Physical Graffiti'' were later included on the 1982 album ''[[Coda (album)|Coda]]''.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=62}}\n\n==Artwork and packaging==\n[[File:Physical Led Zeppelin.jpg|thumb|right|upright|96 and 98 East [[8th Street / St. Mark's Place (Manhattan)]]]]\nThe album was originally released with a die-cut sleeve design depicting a New York City [[tenement]] block, through whose windows various cultural icons could be interchangeably viewed.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=67}} The album designer, [[Peter Corriston]], was looking for a building that was symmetrical with interesting details, that was not obstructed by other objects and would fit the square album cover. He subsequently came up with the rest of the cover based on people moving in and out of the tenement, with various sleeves that could be placed under the main cover and filling the windows with various pieces of information.<ref name=\"Led Zeppelin\">{{cite news |url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B04E6D6123EF93BA3575AC0A9649C8B63|work=The New York Times |title=F.Y.I.|accessdate=15 March 2008 | first=Ed | last=Boland Jr. | date=8 September 2002}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe two five-storey buildings photographed for the album cover are located at 96 and 98 [[St. Mark's Place]] in New York City.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=55}} The original photograph underwent a number of tweaks to arrive at the final image. The fifth floor of the building had to be cropped out to fit the square album cover format.<ref name=\"Led Zeppelin\" />\n\nEschewing the usual [[gatefold]] design in favour of a special die-cut cover, the original album jacket included four covers made up of two inners (for each disc), a middle insert cover and an outer cover. The middle insert cover is white and details all the album track listings and recording information. The outer cover has die-cut windows on the building, so when the middle cover is wrapped around the inner covers and slid into the outer cover, the title of the album is shown on the front cover, spelling out the name \"Physical Graffiti\".{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=55}} Images in the windows touched upon a set of American icons and a range of Hollywood ephemera. Pictures of [[W. C. Fields]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]] alternated with the snapshots of Led Zeppelin.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=67}} Photographs of [[Lee Harvey Oswald]], [[Marcel Duchamp]] and [[Pope Leo XIII]] are also featured. \nPer the liner notes, package concept and design was by AGI/Mike Doud (London) and Peter Corriston (New York).

The capital is [[Sucre]], while the [[seat of government]] and financial center is located in [[La Paz]]. The largest city and principal industrial center is [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], located on the [[Geography of Bolivia|Llanos Orientales]] (tropical lowlands), a mostly flat region in the east of the country.\n\nThe [[sovereign state]] of Bolivia is a [[constitution of Bolivia|constitutionally]] [[unitary state]], divided into [[Departments of Bolivia|nine departments]]. Its geography varies from the peaks of the [[Andes]] in the West, to the Eastern Lowlands, situated within the [[Amazon Basin]]. It is bordered to the north and east by [[Brazil]], to the southeast by [[Paraguay]], to the south by [[Argentina]], to the southwest by [[Chile]], and to the northwest by [[Peru]]. One-third of the country is within the [[Andes|Andean]] mountain range. With {{convert|1,098,581|km2|abbr=on}} of area, Bolivia is the fifth largest country in [[South America]], after [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]], [[Peru]] and [[Colombia]] (and alongside [[Paraguay]], one of the only two landlocked countries in the [[Americas]]), the [[List of countries by area|27th largest in the world]], the largest [[landlocked country]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] and the world's [[Landlocked country|seventh largest landlocked country]], after [[Kazakhstan]], [[Mongolia]], [[Chad]], [[Niger]], [[Mali]] and [[Ethiopia]].\n\nThe country's population, estimated at 11&nbsp;million, is [[multiethnic]], including [[Amerindians]], [[Mestizo]]s, [[Europeans]], [[Asian people|Asian]]s and [[Africans]]. [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the official and predominant language, although 36 [[Languages of Bolivia|indigenous language]]s also have official status, of which the most commonly spoken are [[Guarani dialects|Guarani]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]] and [[Quechuan languages|Quechua languages]].\n\nBefore Spanish colonization, the Andean region of Bolivia was part of the [[Inca Empire]], while the northern and eastern lowlands were inhabited by independent tribes. Spanish ''[[conquistadors]]'' arriving from [[Cuzco]] and [[Asunci\u00f3n]] took control of the region in the 16th century. During the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonial period]] Bolivia was administered by the [[Royal Audiencia of Charcas]]. Spain built its empire in large part upon the silver that was extracted from [[Mining in Bolivia|Bolivia's mines]].\nAfter the first call for independence in 1809, 16 years of war followed before the establishment of the Republic, named for [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]]. Over the course of the 19th and early 20th century Bolivia lost control of several peripheral territories to neighboring countries including the [[War of the Pacific|seizure]] of its coastline by Chile in 1879. Bolivia remained relatively politically stable until 1971, when [[Hugo Banzer]] led a [[History of Bolivia (1964\u201382)#The Banzer regime|coup d'\u00e9tat]] which replaced the socialist government of [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Torres]] with a [[military dictatorship]] headed by Banzer; Torres was murdered in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]] by a right-wing death squad in 1976. Banzer's regime cracked down on [[left-wing politics|leftist and socialist]] opposition and other forms of dissent, resulting in the torture and deaths of a number of Bolivian citizens. Banzer was ousted in 1978 and later returned as the democratically elected president of Bolivia from 1997 to 2001.\n\nModern Bolivia is a charter member of the [[United Nations|UN]], [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], [[Non-Aligned Movement|NAM]], [[Organization of American States|OAS]], [[Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization|ACTO]], [[Bank of the South]], [[ALBA]] and [[Union of South American Nations|USAN]].

Tiwanaku expanded its reaches into the Yungas and brought its culture and way of life to many other cultures in Peru, Bolivia, and Chile. Tiwanaku was not a violent culture in many respects. In order to expand its reach, Tiwanaku exercised great political astuteness, creating colonies, fostering trade agreements (which made the other cultures rather dependent), and instituting state cults.<ref name=\"McAndrews, Timothy L. 1997\">{{cite journal|last=McAndrews|first=Timothy L.|author2=Albarracin-Jordan, Juan |author3=Bermann, Marc |title=Regional Settlement Patterns in the Tiwanaku Valley of Bolivia|journal=Journal of Field Archaeology|year=1997|volume=24|issue=1|pages=67\u201383|doi=10.2307/530562|jstor=530562}}</ref>\n\nThe empire continued to grow with no end in sight.

Further, this elite's control of [[llama]] herds became a powerful control mechanism as llamas were essential for carrying goods between the civic centre and the periphery. These herds also came to symbolize class distinctions between the commoners and the elites. Through this control and manipulation of surplus resources, the elite's power continued to grow until about AD 950.

As the surplus of food decreased, and thus the amount available to underpin their power, the control of the elites began to falter. The capital city became the last place viable for food production due to the resiliency of the raised field method of agriculture. Tiwanaku disappeared around AD 1000 because food production, the main source of the elites' power, dried up.

After 16 years of war the Republic was [[Bolivian Declaration of Independence|proclaimed]] on 6 August 1825.\n\n[[File:Coat of arms of Bolivia (1825).svg|thumb|The first coat of arms of Bolivia, formerly named the Republic of Bol\u00edvar in honor of [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]]]]\n\nIn 1836, Bolivia, under the rule of [[Marshal]] [[Andr\u00e9s de Santa Cruz]], invaded Peru to reinstall the deposed president, [[General]] [[Luis Jos\u00e9 de Orbegoso]]. Peru and Bolivia formed the [[Peru-Bolivian Confederation]], with de Santa Cruz as the ''Supreme Protector''. Following tension between the Confederation and Chile, Chile declared war on 28 December 1836. Argentina separately declared war on the Confederation on 9 May 1837. The Peruvian-Bolivian forces achieved several major victories during the [[War of the Confederation]]: the defeat of the Argentine expedition and the defeat of the first Chilean expedition on the fields of [[Paucarpata District|Paucarpata]] near the city of [[Arequipa]]. The Chilean army and its Peruvian rebel allies surrendered unconditionally and signed the [[Paucarpata Treaty]]. The treaty stipulated that Chile would withdraw from Peru-Bolivia, Chile would return captured Confederate ships, economic relations would be normalized, and the Confederation would pay Peruvian debt to Chile. However, the Chilean government and public rejected the peace treaty. Chile organized a second attack on the Confederation and defeated it in the [[Battle of Yungay]]. After this defeat, Santa Cruz resigned and went to exile in [[Ecuador]] and then Paris, and the Peruvian-Bolivian Confederation was dissolved.\n\nFollowing the renewed independence of Peru, Peruvian president General [[Agust\u00edn Gamarra]] invaded Bolivia. On 18 November 1841, the battle de Ingavi took place, in which the Bolivian Army defeated the Peruvian troops of Gamarra (killed in the battle). After the victory, Bolivia invaded Per\u00fa on several fronts.  The eviction of the Bolivian troops from the south of Peru would be achieved by the greater availability of material and human resources of Peru; the Bolivian Army did not have enough troops to maintain an occupation. In the district of Locumba - Tacna, a column of Peruvian soldiers and peasants defeated a Bolivian regiment in the so-called Battle of Los Altos de Chipe (Locumba). In the district of Sama and in Arica, the Peruvian colonel Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Lavay\u00e9n organized a troop that managed to defeat the Bolivian forces of Colonel Rodr\u00edguez Magari\u00f1os and threaten the port of Arica. In the battle of Tarapac\u00e1 on 7 January 1842, Peruvian militias formed by the commander Juan Buend\u00eda defeated a detachment led by Bolivian colonel Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Garc\u00eda, who died in the confrontation. Bolivian troops left Tacna, Arica and Tarapac\u00e1 in February 1842, retreating towards Moquegua and Puno.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Albarrac\u00edn: La portentosa Heroicidad|last=Cavagnaro Orellana|first=Luis|publisher=Archivo Regional de Tacna|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> The battles of Motoni and&nbsp; Orurillo forced the withdrawal of Bolivian forces occupying Peruvian territory and exposed Bolivia to the threat of counter-invasion.

The Beni River, along with the [[Madeira River]], forms the main tributary of the [[Amazon River]]. From east to west, the basin is formed by other important rivers, such as the [[Madre de Dios River]], the [[Orthon River]], the [[Abuna River]], the [[Yata River]], and the [[Guapor\u00e9 River]]. The most important lakes are [[Rogaguado Lake]], [[Rogagua Lake]], and [[Jara Lake]].\n*The second is the [[R\u00edo de la Plata Basin]], also called the South Basin ({{convert|229500|km\u00b2|sqmi|abbr=on}}/21% of the territory). The tributaries in this basin are in general less abundant than the ones forming the Amazon Basin. The Rio de la Plata Basin is mainly formed by the [[Paraguay River]], [[Pilcomayo River]], and [[Bermejo River]]. The most important lakes are [[Uberaba Lake]] and [[Mandior\u00e9 Lake]], both located in the Bolivian marshland.\n*The third basin is the '''Central Basin''', which is an [[endorheic basin]] ({{convert|145081|km\u00b2|sqmi}}/13% of the territory).

Presidents [[Hern\u00e1n Siles Zuazo]] (1982\u201385) and [[V\u00edctor Paz Estenssoro]] (1985\u201389) began a tradition of ceding power peacefully which has continued, although two presidents have stepped down in the face of popular protests: [[Gonzalo S\u00e1nchez de Lozada]] in 2003 and [[Carlos Mesa]] in 2005.\n\nBolivia's multiparty democracy has seen a wide variety of parties in the presidency and parliament, although the [[Revolutionary Nationalist Movement]], [[Nationalist Democratic Action]], and the [[Revolutionary Left Movement (Bolivia)|Revolutionary Left Movement]] predominated from 1985 to 2005. On 11 November 2019, all senior governmental positions were vacated following a coup that forced [[Evo Morales' resignation|the resignation of Evo Morales and his government]].

The traditionally strong executive branch tends to overshadow the [[National Congress of Bolivia|Congress]], whose role is generally limited to debating and approving legislation initiated by the executive. The judiciary, consisting of the [[Supreme Court of Bolivia|Supreme Court]] and departmental and lower courts, has long been riddled with corruption and inefficiency. Through revisions to the constitution in 1994, and subsequent laws, the government has initiated potentially far-reaching reforms in the judicial system as well as increasing decentralizing powers to departments, municipalities, and indigenous territories.\n\nThe executive branch is headed by a president and vice president, and consists of a variable number (currently, 20) of government [[Ministry (government department)|ministries]]. The president is elected to a five-year term by [[Direct election|popular vote]], and governs from the Presidential Palace (popularly called the Burnt Palace, ''Palacio Quemado'') in La Paz. In the case that no candidate receives an [[absolute majority]] of the popular vote or more than 40% of the vote with an advantage of more than 10% over the second-place finisher, a run-off is to be held among the two candidates most voted.<ref name=\"presidencia.gob.bo\"/>\n\nThe ''Asamblea Legislativa Plurinacional'' ([[Plurinational Legislative Assembly]] or National Congress) has [[Bicameralism|two chambers]].

The capital is [[Sucre]], while the [[seat of government]] and financial center is located in [[La Paz]]. The largest city and principal industrial center is [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], located on the [[Geography of Bolivia|Llanos Orientales]] (tropical lowlands), a mostly flat region in the east of the country.\n\nThe [[sovereign state]] of Bolivia is a [[constitution of Bolivia|constitutionally]] [[unitary state]], divided into [[Departments of Bolivia|nine departments]]. Its geography varies from the peaks of the [[Andes]] in the West, to the Eastern Lowlands, situated within the [[Amazon Basin]]. It is bordered to the north and east by [[Brazil]], to the southeast by [[Paraguay]], to the south by [[Argentina]], to the southwest by [[Chile]], and to the northwest by [[Peru]]. One-third of the country is within the [[Andes|Andean]] mountain range. With {{convert|1,098,581|km2|abbr=on}} of area, Bolivia is the fifth largest country in [[South America]], after [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]], [[Peru]] and [[Colombia]] (and alongside [[Paraguay]], one of the only two landlocked countries in the [[Americas]]), the [[List of countries by area|27th largest in the world]], the largest [[landlocked country]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] and the world's [[Landlocked country|seventh largest landlocked country]], after [[Kazakhstan]], [[Mongolia]], [[Chad]], [[Niger]], [[Mali]] and [[Ethiopia]].\n\nThe country's population, estimated at 11&nbsp;million, is [[multiethnic]], including [[Amerindians]], [[Mestizo]]s, [[Europeans]], [[Asian people|Asian]]s and [[Africans]]. [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the official and predominant language, although 36 [[Languages of Bolivia|indigenous language]]s also have official status, of which the most commonly spoken are [[Guarani dialects|Guarani]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]] and [[Quechuan languages|Quechua languages]].\n\nBefore Spanish colonization, the Andean region of Bolivia was part of the [[Inca Empire]], while the northern and eastern lowlands were inhabited by independent tribes.

Further, this elite's control of [[llama]] herds became a powerful control mechanism as llamas were essential for carrying goods between the civic centre and the periphery. These herds also came to symbolize class distinctions between the commoners and the elites.

As the surplus of food decreased, and thus the amount available to underpin their power, the control of the elites began to falter. The capital city became the last place viable for food production due to the resiliency of the raised field method of agriculture. Tiwanaku disappeared around AD 1000 because food production, the main source of the elites' power, dried up.

That revolution was followed by the [[La Paz revolution]] on 16 July 1809. The La Paz revolution marked a complete split with the Spanish government, while the Chuquisaca Revolution established a local independent junta in the name of the Spanish King deposed by Napoleon Bonaparte. Both revolutions were short-lived and defeated by the Spanish authorities in the Viceroyalty of the Rio de La Plata, but the following year the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] raged across the continent.\n\nBolivia was captured and recaptured many times during the war by the [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|royalists]] and patriots. Buenos Aires sent three military campaigns, all of which were defeated, and eventually limited itself to protecting the national borders at Salta. Bolivia was finally freed of Royalist dominion by Marshal [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]], with a military campaign coming from the North in support of the campaign of [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]]. After 16 years of war the Republic was [[Bolivian Declaration of Independence|proclaimed]] on 6 August 1825.\n\n[[File:Coat of arms of Bolivia (1825).svg|thumb|The first coat of arms of Bolivia, formerly named the Republic of Bol\u00edvar in honor of [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]]]]\n\nIn 1836, Bolivia, under the rule of [[Marshal]] [[Andr\u00e9s de Santa Cruz]], invaded Peru to reinstall the deposed president, [[General]] [[Luis Jos\u00e9 de Orbegoso]]. Peru and Bolivia formed the [[Peru-Bolivian Confederation]], with de Santa Cruz as the ''Supreme Protector''. Following tension between the Confederation and Chile, Chile declared war on 28 December 1836. Argentina separately declared war on the Confederation on 9 May 1837. The Peruvian-Bolivian forces achieved several major victories during the [[War of the Confederation]]: the defeat of the Argentine expedition and the defeat of the first Chilean expedition on the fields of [[Paucarpata District|Paucarpata]] near the city of [[Arequipa]]. The Chilean army and its Peruvian rebel allies surrendered unconditionally and signed the [[Paucarpata Treaty]]. The treaty stipulated that Chile would withdraw from Peru-Bolivia, Chile would return captured Confederate ships, economic relations would be normalized, and the Confederation would pay Peruvian debt to Chile. However, the Chilean government and public rejected the peace treaty. Chile organized a second attack on the Confederation and defeated it in the [[Battle of Yungay]]. After this defeat, Santa Cruz resigned and went to exile in [[Ecuador]] and then Paris, and the Peruvian-Bolivian Confederation was dissolved.\n\nFollowing the renewed independence of Peru, Peruvian president General [[Agust\u00edn Gamarra]] invaded Bolivia. On 18 November 1841, the battle de Ingavi took place, in which the Bolivian Army defeated the Peruvian troops of Gamarra (killed in the battle). After the victory, Bolivia invaded Per\u00fa on several fronts.  The eviction of the Bolivian troops from the south of Peru would be achieved by the greater availability of material and human resources of Peru; the Bolivian Army did not have enough troops to maintain an occupation. In the district of Locumba - Tacna, a column of Peruvian soldiers and peasants defeated a Bolivian regiment in the so-called Battle of Los Altos de Chipe (Locumba). In the district of Sama and in Arica, the Peruvian colonel Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Lavay\u00e9n organized a troop that managed to defeat the Bolivian forces of Colonel Rodr\u00edguez Magari\u00f1os and threaten the port of Arica.

The relatively robust economic growth of the mid-1990s continued until about the third year of its term in office. After that, regional, global and domestic factors contributed to a decline in economic growth. Financial crises in Argentina and Brazil, lower world prices for export commodities, and reduced employment in the coca sector depressed the Bolivian economy. The public also perceived a significant amount of public sector corruption. These factors contributed to increasing social protests during the second half of Banzer's term.\n\nBetween January 1999 and April 2000, large-scale [[2000 Cochabamba protests|protests]] erupted in [[Cochabamba]], Bolivia's third largest city, in response to the [[Water privatization|privatisation of water]] resources by foreign companies and a subsequent doubling of water prices.

A July agreement between the MNR and the fourth-place MIR, which had again been led in the election by former President Jaime Paz Zamora, virtually ensured the election of S\u00e1nchez de Lozada in the congressional run-off, and on 6 August he was sworn in for the second time.

Faced with the option of resigning or more bloodshed, S\u00e1nchez de Lozada offered his resignation in a letter to an emergency session of Congress. After his resignation was accepted and his vice president, [[Carlos Mesa]], invested, he left on a commercially scheduled flight for the United States.\n\nThe country's internal situation became unfavorable for such political action on the international stage. After a resurgence of gas protests in 2005, Carlos Mesa attempted to resign in January 2005, but his offer was refused by Congress. On 22 March 2005, after weeks of new street protests from organizations accusing Mesa of bowing to U.S. corporate interests, Mesa again offered his resignation to Congress, which was accepted on 10 June.

However, by 2013 the foreign assistance is just a fraction of the government budget thanks to tax collection mainly from the profitable exports to Brazil and Argentina of natural gas.\n\n=== Foreign-exchange reserves ===\nThe amount in reserve currencies and [[gold]] held by Bolivia's Central Bank advanced from 1.085 billion US dollars in 2000, under [[Hugo Banzer Suarez]]'s government, to 15.282 billion US dollars in 2014 under [[Evo Morales]]' government.\n\n{| style=\"margin: 1em auto; padding: 0.5e text-align:left; clear:all; font-size:90%\"\n| style=\"background:#black; color:white; text-align: center; background-color: #9acd32;\" colspan=\"6\" |'''{{big|Foreign-exchange reserves 2000\u20132014 (MM US$)}}''' '''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bcb.gob.bo/webdocs/ReservasInternacionales/graficas/RIN_PAGWEB15ene15.pdf|title=Bolivia: Reservas Internacionales del BCB al 15 de Enero del 2015|author=BCB|date=19 January 2015|access-date=1 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102171343/https://www.bcb.gob.bo/webdocs/ReservasInternacionales/graficas/RIN_PAGWEB15ene15.pdf|archive-date=2 January 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>'''\n|-\n|\n<timeline>\nColors=\n  id:lightgrey value:rgb(0.85,0.85,0.75)\n  id:darkgrey  value:rgb(0.80,0.70,0.95)\n  id:sfondo value:rgb(0.95,0.95,0.95)\n  id:barra value:rgb(0.30,0.40,0.50)\n\nImageSize  = width:450 height:225\nPlotArea   = left: 60 bottom: 30 top: 20 right: 20\nDateFormat = x.y\nPeriod     = from:0 till:16000\nTimeAxis   = orientation:vertical\nAlignBars  = late\nScaleMajor = gridcolor:darkgrey increment:2000 start:2000\nScaleMinor = gridcolor:lightgrey increment:1000 start:1000\nBackgroundColors = canvas:sfondo\n\nBarData=\n\n  bar: 2000 text: 2000\n  bar: 2001 text: 2001\n  bar: 2002 text: 2002\n  bar: 2003 text: 2003\n  bar: 2004 text: 2004\n  bar: 2005 text: 2005\n  bar: 2006 text: 2006\n  bar: 2007 text: 2007\n  bar: 2008 text: 2008\n  bar: 2009 text: 2009\n  bar: 2010 text: 2010\n  bar: 2011 text: 2011\n  bar: 2012 text: 2012\n  bar: 2013 text: 2013\n  bar: 2014 text: 2014\n\nPlotData=\n  color:barra width:15 align:center\n\n  bar: 2000 from:1085  till: 0\n  bar: 2001 from:1077  till: 0\n  bar: 2002 from:854   till: 0\n  bar: 2003 from:976   till: 0\n  bar: 2004 from:1123  till: 0\n  bar: 2005 from:1714  till: 0\n  bar: 2006 from:3178  till: 0\n  bar: 2007 from:5319  till: 0\n  bar: 2008 from:7715  till: 0\n  bar: 2009 from:8580  till: 0\n  bar: 2010 from:9730  till: 0\n  bar: 2011 from:12091 till: 0\n  bar: 2012 from:14064 till: 0\n  bar: 2013 from:14430 till: 0\n  bar: 2014 from:15282 till: 0\n\nPlotData=\n\n  bar: 2000 at: 1085  fontsize:S text: 1.085 shift:(0,5)\n  bar: 2001 at: 1077  fontsize:S text: 1.077 shift:(0,5)\n  bar: 2002 at: 854   fontsize:S text: 854 shift:(0,5)\n  bar: 2003 at: 976   fontsize:S text: 976  shift:(0,5)\n  bar: 2004 at: 1123  fontsize:S text: 1'123 shift:(0,5)\n  bar: 2005 at: 1714  fontsize:S text: 1'714  shift:(0,5)\n  bar: 2006 at: 3178  fontsize:S text: 3'178 shift:(0,5)\n  bar: 2007 at: 5319  fontsize:S text: 5'319 shift:(0,5)\n  bar: 2008 at: 7715  fontsize:S text: 7'715 shift:(0,5)\n  bar: 2009 at: 8580  fontsize:S text: 8'580 shift:(0,5)\n  bar: 2010 at: 9730  fontsize:S text: 9'730  shift:(0,5)\n  bar: 2011 at: 12091 fontsize:S text: 12'091 shift:(0,5)\n  bar: 2012 at: 14064 fontsize:S text: 14'064 shift:(0,5)\n  bar: 2013 at: 14430 fontsize:S text: 14'430 shift:(0,5)\n  bar: 2014 at: 15282 fontsize:S text: 15'282 shift:(0,5)\n\n</timeline>\n|-\n|  style=\"background:#f5f5f5; text-align:center;\"| Fuente: [[Banco Central de Bolivia]], Gr\u00e1fica elaborada por: [[Wikipedia]].\n|}\n\n===Tourism===\n{{Main|Tourism in Bolivia}}\n\n{{wide image|Isla_del_Pescado,_Salar_de_Uyuni.jpg|900px|[[Salar de Uyuni]], one of the most visited sites in Bolivia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldlyadventurer.com/salar-de-uyuni-bolivian-salt-flats/|title=Visiting El Salar de Uyuni, Bolivia: A 2019 How-To Guide|date=16 May 2019}}</ref>}}\n\nThe income from tourism has become increasingly important.

The country's second largest city, [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], manages its own water and sanitation system relatively successfully by way of cooperatives. The government of [[Evo Morales]] intends to strengthen citizen participation within the sector. Increasing coverage requires a substantial increase of investment financing.\n\nAccording to the government the main problems in the sector are low access to sanitation throughout the country; low access to water in rural areas; insufficient and ineffective investments; a low visibility of community service providers; a lack of respect of indigenous customs; \"technical and institutional difficulties in the design and implementation of projects\"; a lack of capacity to operate and maintain infrastructure; an institutional framework that is \"not consistent with the political change in the country\"; \"ambiguities in the social participation schemes\"; a reduction in the quantity and \nquality of water due to climate change; pollution and a lack of integrated water resources management; and the lack of policies and programs for the reuse of wastewater.<ref name=\"PNSB\">Estado Plurinacional de Bolivia:[http://www.mmaya.gob.bo/documentos/pnsb_final.pdf Plan Nacional de Saneamiento Basico 2008\u20132015] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228092846/http://www.mmaya.gob.bo/documentos/pnsb_final.pdf |date=28 February 2013 }}, retrieved on 30 September 2010</ref>\n\nOnly 27% of the population has access to [[improved sanitation]], 80 to 88% has access to [[improved water source]]s.

Zeppelin's notions were first formulated in 1874<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Eckener 1938, pp. 155\u2013157.</ref> and developed in detail in 1893.<ref name=Doo187>Dooley 2004, p. A.187.</ref> They were patented in Germany in 1895 and in the United States in 1899.<ref name=\"Doo190\"/> After the outstanding success of the Zeppelin design, the word ''zeppelin'' came to be commonly used to refer to all rigid airships. Zeppelins were first flown commercially in 1910 by [[Deutsche Luftschiffahrts-AG]] (DELAG), the world's first airline in revenue service. By mid-1914, DELAG had carried over 10,000 fare-paying passengers on over 1,500 flights. During [[World War I]], the German military made extensive use of Zeppelins as bombers and scouts, killing over 500 people in bombing raids in Britain.<ref>Cole and Cheeseman 1984, p. 449.</ref>\n\nThe defeat of Germany in 1918 temporarily slowed down the airship business. Although DELAG established a scheduled daily service between [[Berlin]], [[Munich]], and [[Friedrichshafen]] in 1919, the airships built for this service eventually had to be surrendered under the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], which also prohibited Germany from building large airships. An exception was made allowing the construction of [[USS Los Angeles (ZR-3)|one airship for the US Navy]], which saved the company from extinction. In 1926 the restrictions on airship construction were lifted, and with the aid of donations from the public, work was started on the construction of [[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|LZ 127 ''Graf Zeppelin'']]. This revived the company's fortunes, and during the 1930s, the airships ''Graf Zeppelin'' and the larger [[LZ 129 Hindenburg|LZ 129 ''Hindenburg'']] operated regular [[transatlantic flight]]s from Germany to North America and Brazil. The [[Empire State Building#Dirigible (airship) terminal|Art Deco spire of the Empire State Building]] was originally designed to serve as a mooring mast for Zeppelins and other airships, although it was found that high winds made this impossible and the plan was abandoned.<ref name=\"WilliamsBlond2004\">{{cite book |author1=China Williams |author2=Becca Blond |title=New York State |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LyNJyEcFSJwC&pg=PA86 |year=2004 |publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74104-125-5 |page=86}}</ref> The [[Hindenburg disaster|''Hindenburg'' disaster]] in 1937, along with political and economic issues, hastened the demise of Zeppelins.\n\n==Principal characteristics==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=June 2018}}<!--4 paragraphs without citations-->\n[[File:Zeppelin-LZ-127 internal and gas cells.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|right|The pink ovals depict [[hydrogen]] cells inside the LZ 127, the magenta elements are ''[[Blaugas]]'' cells. The full-resolution picture labels more internals.]]\nThe principal feature of Zeppelin's design was a fabric-covered rigid metal framework made up from transverse rings and longitudinal girders containing a number of individual gasbags.<ref name=globsecure>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/airship.htm Airships] ''GlobalSecurity.org.'' Retrieved: 20 July 2007.</ref> The advantage of this design was that the aircraft could be much larger than [[non-rigid airship]]s, which relied on a slight overpressure within the single pressure envelope to maintain their shape. The framework of most Zeppelins was made of [[duralumin]] (a combination of aluminum and copper as well as two or three other metals\u2014its exact content was kept a secret for years). Early Zeppelins used rubberised cotton for the gasbags, but most later craft used [[goldbeater's skin]], made from the intestines of cattle.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/02/29/a-new-generation-of-airships-is-born|title=A New Generation of Airships Is Born|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe first Zeppelins had long cylindrical hulls with tapered ends and complex multi-plane [[fin]]s. During World War&nbsp;I, following the lead of their rivals [[Sch\u00fctte-Lanz]] Luftschiffbau, the design changed to the more familiar streamlined shape with [[cruciform]] tail surfaces, as used by almost all later airships.\n\nThey were propelled by several [[internal combustion engine|engines]], mounted in [[airship#gondola|gondolas]] or engine cars, which were attached to the outside of the structural framework. Some of these could provide reverse thrust for manoeuvring while mooring.\n\nEarly models had a comparatively small externally mounted gondola for passengers and crew which was attached to the bottom of the frame. This space was never heated (fire outside of the kitchen was considered too risky) so passengers during trips across the North Atlantic or Siberia were forced to bundle themselves in blankets and furs to keep warm and were often miserable with the cold.\n\nBy the time of the ''Hindenburg'', several important changes had taken place: the passenger space had been relocated to the interior of the overall vessel, passenger rooms were insulated from the exterior by the dining area, and forced-warm air could be circulated from the water that cooled the forward engines, all of which made traveling much more comfortable; though it did deprive passengers of the views from the windows of their berths which had been a major attraction on the ''Graf Zeppelin''. On both the older and newer vessels, the external viewing windows were often opened during flight. The flight ceiling was so low that no pressurization of the cabins was necessary, though the ''Hindenburg'' did maintain a pressurized air-locked smoking room (no flame allowed, however\u2014a single electric lighter was provided, and could not be removed from the room).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.airships.net/hindenburg/interiors |title=The Hindenburg\u2019s Interior: Passenger Decks |last=Grossman |first=Dan |date=2009 |publisher=Airships.net}}</ref>\n\nAccess to Zeppelins was achieved in a number of ways. The ''Graf Zeppelin'''s gondola was accessed while the vessel was on the ground, via gangways. The ''Hindenburg'' also had passenger gangways leading from the ground directly into its hull, which could be withdrawn entirely, ground access to the gondola, and an exterior access hatch via its electrical room; this latter was intended for crew use only.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early designs===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1972-099-15, Ferdinand Graf Zeppelin am Schreibtisch.jpg|thumb|Ferdinand von Zeppelin]]\nCount [[Ferdinand von Zeppelin]]'s serious interest in airship development began in 1874, when he took inspiration from a lecture given by [[Heinrich von Stephan]] on the subject of \"World Postal Services and Air Travel\" to outline the basic principle of his later craft in a diary entry dated 25 March 1874.<ref name=Doo183>Dooley 2004, p.

Convinced of the potential importance of aviation, he started working on various designs in 1891, and had completed detailed designs by 1893. An official committee reviewed his plans in 1894,<ref name=Doo187/> and he received a patent, granted on 31 August 1895,<ref name=\"de Syon 18\">{{Harvnb|de Syon|2001|p=18.}}</ref> with [[Theodor Kober]] producing the technical drawings.<ref name=Doo190>Dooley 2004, p.

Zeppelin also sought support from the industrialist [[Carl Berg (airship builder)|Carl Berg]], then engaged in construction work on the second airship design of [[David Schwarz (aviation inventor)|David Schwarz]]. Berg was under contract not to supply aluminium to any other airship manufacturer, and subsequently made a payment to Schwartz's widow as compensation for breaking this agreement.<ref name=Doo193>Dooley 2004, p.

Responsibility for the detail design was given to Kober, whose place was later taken by [[Ludwig D\u00fcrr]], and construction of the first airship began in 1899 in a floating assembly-hall or hangar in the Bay of Manzell near [[Friedrichshafen]] on [[Lake Constance]] (the ''Bodensee''). The intention behind the floating hall was to facilitate the difficult task of bringing the airship out of the hall, as it could easily be aligned with the wind.

This renewed the interest of the German military, but a condition of purchase of an airship was a 24-hour endurance trial.<ref name=\"de Syon 35\">de Syon 2001, p. 35.</ref> This was beyond the capabilities of LZ&nbsp;3, leading Zeppelin to construct his fourth design, the [[Zeppelin LZ 4|LZ 4]], first flown on 20 June 1908. On 1 July it was flown over Switzerland to Z\u00fcrich and then back to Lake Constance, covering 386&nbsp;km (240&nbsp;mi) and reaching an altitude of 795 m (2,600&nbsp;ft). An attempt to complete the 24-hour trial flight ended when LZ&nbsp;4 had to make a landing at [[Leinfelden-Echterdingen|Echterdingen]] near [[Stuttgart]] because of mechanical problems. During the stop, a storm tore the airship away from its moorings on the afternoon of 5 August 1908. It crashed into a tree, caught fire, and quickly burnt out. No one was seriously injured.\n[[File:LZ4 after Echterdingen disaster.jpg|thumb|Wreckage of LZ&nbsp;4]]\nThis accident would have finished Zeppelin's experiments, but his flights had generated huge public interest and a sense of national pride regarding his work, and spontaneous donations from the public began pouring in, eventually totalling over six million marks.<ref>de Syon 2001, p. 38.</ref> This enabled the Count to found the ''[[Luftschiffbau Zeppelin|Luftschiffbau Zeppelin GmbH]]'' (Airship Construction Zeppelin Ltd.) and the [[Zeppelin Foundation]].\n\n===Before World War I===\n[[File:LZ7 passenger zeppelin mod.jpg|thumbnail|LZ 7 ''Deutschland'']]\nBefore World War I (1914\u20131918) the Zeppelin company manufactured 21 more airships.

In April 1913 its newly built sister-ship LZ&nbsp;15 (Z&nbsp;IV) accidentally intruded into French airspace owing to a navigational error caused by high winds and poor visibility. The commander judged it proper to land the airship to demonstrate that the incursion was accidental, and brought the ship down on the military parade-ground at [[Lun\u00e9ville]]. The airship remained on the ground until the following day, permitting a detailed examination by French airship experts.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times|articlename = The German Airship Incident|section= News|day_of_week= Saturday|date= 5 April 1913|page_number= 8|issue= 40178|column= B}}</ref>\n{{main|DELAG}}\nIn 1909 Count Zeppelin founded the world's first airline, the Deutsche Luftschiffahrts-Aktiengesellschaft (German Airship Travel Corporation), generally known as [[DELAG]]<ref name=\"Robinson 1971, p. 15\">Robinson 1971, p. 15</ref> to promote his airships, initially using LZ&nbsp;6, which he had hoped to sell to the German Army.

The first airship of the program, L&nbsp;2, was ordered on 30 January.

Zeppelins attacking Paris had to first fly over the system of forts between the front and the city, from which they were subjected to antiaircraft fire with reduced risk of [[collateral damage]].

Two Navy zeppelins were transferred to [[Vai\u0146ode Air Base|Wainoden]] on the [[Courland Peninsula]]. A preliminary attempt to bomb [[Reval]] on 28 December ended in failure caused by operating problems due to the extreme cold, and one of the airships was destroyed in a forced landing at [[Serappen]]. The plan was subsequently abandoned.<ref>Robinson 1971, pp. 248-53</ref>\n\nIn 1917 the German High Command made an attempt to use a Zeppelin to deliver supplies to [[Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck|Lettow-Vorbeck's]] forces in [[East African Campaign (World War I)|German East Africa]]. [[List of Zeppelins#LZ 102|L&nbsp;57]], a specially lengthened craft was to have flown the mission but was destroyed shortly after completion. A Zeppelin then under construction, [[Zeppelin LZ104|L&nbsp;59]], was then modified for the mission: it set off from Yambol on 21 November 1917 and nearly reached its destination, but was ordered to return by radio. Its journey covered {{convert|6400|km|mi|abbr=on}} and lasted 95 hours. It was then used for reconnaissance and bombing missions in the eastern Mediterranean. It flew one bombing mission against [[Naples]] on 10\u201311 March 1918. A planned attack on [[Suez]] was turned back by high winds, and on 7 April 1918 it was on a mission to bomb the British naval base at [[Malta]] when it caught fire over the [[Straits of Otranto]], with the loss of all its crew.\n\nOn 5&nbsp;January 1918, a fire at Ahlhorn destroyed four of the specialised double sheds along with four Zeppelins and one Sch\u00fctte-Lanz. In July 1918, the [[Tondern raid]] conducted by the RAF and Royal Navy, destroyed two Zeppelins in their sheds.\n\n====1914\u201318 naval patrols====\n[[File:SMS Seydlitz mit Zeppelin.jpg|thumbnail|A Zeppelin flying over [[SMS Seydlitz|SMS ''Seydlitz'']]]]\n\nThe main use of the airship was in reconnaissance over the [[North Sea]] and the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]], and the majority of airships manufactured were used by the Navy. Patrolling had priority over any other airship activity.<ref name=Lehmann6>[[#Lehmann|Lehmann Chapter VI]]</ref> During the war almost 1,000 missions were flown over the North Sea alone,<ref name=e /> compared to about 50 strategic bombing raids. The German Navy had some 15 Zeppelins in commission by the end of 1915 and was able to have two or more patrolling continuously at any one time. However their operations were limited by weather conditions. On 16 February L&nbsp;3 and L&nbsp;4 were lost owing to a combination of engine failure and high winds, L&nbsp;3 crashing on the Danish island of [[Fan\u00f8]] without loss of life and L&nbsp;4 coming down at [[Bl\u00e5vandshuk|Blaavands Huk]]; eleven crew escaped from the forward gondola, after which the lightened airship with four crew members remaining in the aft engine car was blown out to sea and lost.<ref>Robinson 1971, pp. 83-4</ref>\n\nAt this stage in the war there was no clear doctrine for the use of Naval airships. A single Zeppelin, L&nbsp;5, played an unimportant part in the [[Battle of Dogger Bank (1915)|Battle of the Dogger Bank]] on 24 January 1915. L&nbsp;5 was carrying out a routine patrol when it picked up [[Franz von Hipper|Admiral Hipper]]'s radio signal announcing that he was engaged with the British battle cruiser squadron. Heading towards the German fleet's position, the Zeppelin was forced to climb above the cloud cover by fire from the British fleet: its commander then decided that it was his duty to cover the retreating German fleet rather than observe British movements.<ref>Robinson 1971, pp81-2</ref>\n\nIn 1915 patrols were only carried out on 124 days, and in other years the total was considerably less.<ref>Robinson 1971, p 350</ref> They prevented British ships from approaching Germany, spotted when and where the British were laying mines and later aided in the destruction of those mines.<ref name=Lehmann6/> Zeppelins would sometimes land on the sea next to a minesweeper, bring aboard an officer and show him the mines' locations.<ref name=Lehmann6/>\n\nIn 1917 the British Navy began to take effective countermeasures against airship patrols over the North Sea. In April the first [[Curtiss Model H|Curtiss H.12 \"Large America\"]] long-range [[flying boats]] were delivered to [[RNAS Felixstowe]], and in July 1917 the aircraft carrier [[HMS Furious (47)|HMS ''Furious'']] entered service, and launching platforms for aeroplanes were fitted to the forward turrets of some light cruisers. On 14 May L&nbsp;22 was shot down near [[Terschelling|Terschelling Bank]] by an H.12 flown by Lt. Galpin and Sub-Lt. Leckie which had been alerted following interception of its radio traffic.<ref>Robinson 1971, pp. 233-5</ref> Two further unsuccessful interceptions were made by Galpin and Leckie on 24 May and 5 June, and on 14 June L&nbsp;43 was brought down by an H.12 flown by Sub Lts. Hobbs and Dickie. On the same day Galpin and Leckie intercepted and attacked L&nbsp;46. The Germans had believed that the previous unsuccessful attacks had been made by an aircraft operating from one of the British Navy's seaplane carriers: now realising that there was a new threat, Strasser ordered airships patrolling in the Terschilling area to maintain an altitude of at least 4,000&nbsp;m (13,000&nbsp;ft), considerably reducing their effectiveness.<ref>Robinson 1971, p.241</ref> On 21 August L&nbsp;23, patrolling off the Danish coast, was spotted by the British 3rd Light Cruiser squadron which was in the area. {{HMS|Yarmouth|1911|6}} launched its [[Sopwith Pup]], and Sub-Lt. B. A. Smart succeeded in shooting the Zeppelin down in flames. The cause of the airship's loss was not discovered by the Germans, who believed the Zeppelin had been brought down by antiaircraft fire from surface ships.<ref>Robinson 1971, pp. 243-4</ref>\n\n====Bombing campaign against Britain====\n{{further|German strategic bombing during World War I}}\n[[File:It is far better to face the bullets.jpg|thumb|right|upright|British First World War poster of a Zeppelin above London at night]]\n\nAt the beginning of the conflict the German command had high hopes for the airships, which were considerably more capable than contemporary light fixed-wing machines: they were almost as fast, could carry multiple machine guns, and had enormously greater [[bomb]]-load range and endurance. Contrary to expectation, it was not easy to ignite the hydrogen using standard bullets and shrapnel. The Allies only started to exploit the Zeppelin's great vulnerability to fire when a combination of [[Pomeroy bullet|Pomeroy]] and [[Frank Arthur Brock|Brock]] explosive ammunition with Buckingham [[incendiary ammunition]] was used in [[fighter aircraft]] machine guns during 1916.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/FlightPDFArchive/1919/1919%20-%200895.PDF |title=The Brock Bullet Claim |last= |first= |website=flightglobal.com |publisher=Flight Aircraft Engineer Magazine |accessdate=12 August 2018 }}</ref> The British had been concerned over the threat posed by Zeppelins since 1909, and attacked the Zeppelin bases early in the war. LZ&nbsp;25 was destroyed in its hangar at D\u00fcsseldorf on 8 October 1914 by bombs dropped by Flt Lt Reginald Marix, RNAS,<ref>Thetford, Owen. ''British Naval Aircraft since 1912''. London: Putnam, 4th ed, 1978. {{ISBN|0-370-30021-1}} p. 286</ref> and the sheds at Cologne as well as the Zeppelin works in Friedrichshafen were also attacked. These raids were followed by the [[Cuxhaven Raid]] on Christmas Day 1914, one of the first operations carried out by ship-launched aeroplanes.\n\nAirship raids on Great Britain were approved by the [[William II of Germany|Kaiser]] on 7 January 1915, although he excluded London as a target and further demanded that no attacks be made on historic buildings.<ref>Robinson 1971, pp. 55-6</ref> The raids were intended to target only military sites on the east coast and around the Thames estuary, but bombing accuracy was poor owing to the height at which the airships flew and navigation was problematic. The airships relied largely on [[dead reckoning]], supplemented by a radio direction-finding system of limited accuracy. After [[Blackout (wartime)|blackout]]s became widespread, many bombs fell at random on uninhabited countryside.\n\n=====1915=====\nThe first raid on England took place on the night of 19\u201320 January 1915. Two Zeppelins, L&nbsp;3 and L&nbsp;4, intended to attack [[Humberside]] but, diverted by strong winds, eventually dropped their bombs on [[Great Yarmouth]], [[Sheringham]], [[King's Lynn]] and the surrounding villages, killing four and injuring 16. Material damage was estimated at \u00a37,740.<ref>Cole and Cheesman, 1984, p. 24</ref>\n\nThe Kaiser authorised the bombing of the London docks on 12 February 1915,<ref>Robinson 1971, p. 67</ref> but no raids on London took place until May. Two Navy raids failed due to bad weather on 14 and 15 April, and it was decided to delay further attempts until the more capable [[Zeppelin P Class|P class Zeppelins]] were in service. The Army received the first of these, LZ&nbsp;38, and Erich Linnarz commanded it on a raid over [[Ipswich]] on 29\u201330 April and another, attacking [[Southend]] on 9\u201310 May. LZ&nbsp;38 also attacked [[Dover]] and [[Ramsgate]] on 16\u201317 May, before returning to bomb Southend on 26\u201327 May. These four raids killed six people and injured six, causing property damage estimated at \u00a316,898.<ref name=\"cole p51-55\">Cole and Cheesman 1984, pp. 51\u201355.</ref> Twice Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) aircraft tried to intercept LZ&nbsp;38 but on both occasions it was either able to outclimb the aircraft or was already at too great an altitude for the aircraft to intercept.\n\nOn 31 May Linnarz commanded LZ&nbsp;38 on the first raid against London. In total some 120 bombs were dropped on a line stretching from [[Stoke Newington]] south to [[Stepney]] and then north toward [[Leytonstone]]. Seven people were killed and 35 injured. 41 fires were started, burning out seven buildings and the total damage was assessed at \u00a318,596. Aware of the problems that the Germans were experiencing in navigation, this raid caused the government to issue a [[D notice]] prohibiting the press from reporting anything about raids that was not mentioned in official statements. Only one of the 15 defensive sorties managed to make visual contact with the enemy, and one of the pilots, Flt Lieut D. M. Barnes, was killed on attempting to land.<ref>Cole and Cheesman, 1984, pp. 56-8</ref>\n\nThe first naval attempt on London took place on 4 June: strong winds caused the commander of L&nbsp;9 to misjudge his position, and the bombs were dropped on [[Gravesend, Kent|Gravesend]]. L&nbsp;9 was also diverted by the weather on 6\u20137 June, attacking [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] instead of London and causing considerable damage.<ref>Cole and Cheesman 1984, p.60</ref> On the same night an Army raid of three Zeppelins also failed because of the weather, and as the airships returned to Evere (Brussels) they ran into a counter-raid by RNAS aircraft flying from [[Veurne|Furnes]], Belgium. LZ&nbsp;38 was destroyed on the ground and LZ&nbsp;37 was intercepted in the air by [[Reginald Alexander John Warneford|R. A. J. Warneford]], who dropped six bombs on the airship, setting it on fire. All but one of the crew died. Warneford was awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] for his achievement. As a consequence of the RNAS raid both the Army and Navy withdrew from their bases in Belgium.<ref>Robinson 1971, p. 77</ref>\n\nAfter an ineffective attack by L&nbsp;10 on [[Tyneside]] on 15\u201316 June the short summer nights discouraged further raids for some months, and the remaining Army Zeppelins were reassigned to the Eastern and Balkan fronts. The Navy resumed raids on Britain in August, when three largely ineffective raids were carried out. On 10 August the antiaircraft guns had their first success, causing L&nbsp;12 to come down into the sea off [[Zeebrugge]],<ref>Cole and Cheesman pp. 64-7</ref> and on 17\u201318 August L&nbsp;10 became the first Navy airship to reach London. Mistaking the reservoirs of the [[Lea Valley]] for the Thames, it dropped its bombs on [[Walthamstow]] and Leytonstone.<ref>Cole and Cheesman 1984, p. 68</ref> L&nbsp;10 was destroyed a little over two weeks later: it was struck by lightning and caught fire off [[Cuxhaven]], and the entire crew was killed.<ref>Robinson 1971, p. 384.</ref> Three Army airships set off to bomb London on 7\u20138 September, of which two succeeded: SL&nbsp;2 dropped bombs between [[Southwark]] and [[Woolwich]]: LZ&nbsp;74 scattered 39 bombs over [[Cheshunt]] before heading on to London and dropping a single bomb on [[Fenchurch Street station]].\n\n[[File:Zeppelin Raid plaque, 61 Farringdon Road, London, England, IMG 5217 edit.jpg|thumb|left|A commemorative plaque at 61 [[Farringdon Road]], London]]\n\nThe Navy attempted to follow up the Army's success the following night. One Zeppelin targeted the benzol plant at [[Skinningrove]] and three set off to bomb London: two were forced to turn back but L&nbsp;13, commanded by ''Kapit\u00e4nleutnant'' Heinrich Mathy reached London. The bomb-load included a {{convert|300|kg|lb}} bomb, the largest yet carried. This exploded near [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield Market]], destroying several houses and killing two men. More bombs fell on the textile warehouses north of [[St Paul's Cathedral]], causing a fire which despite the attendance of 22 fire engines caused over half a million pounds of damage: Mathy then turned east, dropping his remaining bombs on [[Liverpool Street station]]. The Zeppelin was the target of concentrated antiaircraft fire, but no hits were scored and the falling shrapnel caused both damage and alarm on the ground. The raid killed 22 people and injured 87.<ref>Cross 1991, p. 35.</ref> The monetary damage was over one sixth of the total damage inflicted by bombing raids during the war.<ref>Robinson 1971 p. 109</ref>\n\nAfter three more raids were scattered by the weather, a five-Zeppelin raid was launched by the Navy on 13 October, the \"Theatreland Raid.\" Arriving over the Norfolk coast at around 18:30, the Zeppelins encountered new ground defences installed since the September raid; these had no success, although the airship commanders commented on the improved defences of the city.<ref>Robinson 1971, p. 117</ref> L&nbsp;15 began bombing over [[Charing Cross]], the first bombs striking the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]] and the corner of Exeter and Wellington Streets, killing 17 and injuring 20. None of the other Zeppelins reached central London: bombs fell on Woolwich, [[Guildford]], [[Tonbridge]], [[Croydon]], [[Hertford]] and an army camp near Folkestone. A total of 71 people were killed and 128 injured.<ref>Cole and Cheesman 1984, p. 73</ref> This was the last raid of 1915, as bad weather coincided with the new moon in both November and December 1915 and continued into January 1916.\n\nAlthough these raids had no significant military impact, the psychological effect was considerable. The writer [[D. H. Lawrence]] described one raid in a letter to [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]]:<ref>Boulton, 2000, p. 106.</ref>\n{{quote|Then we saw the Zeppelin above us, just ahead, amid a gleaming of clouds: high up, like a bright golden finger, quite small (...) Then there was flashes near the ground\u2014and the shaking noise. It was [[Paradise Lost|like Milton]]\u2014then there was war in heaven. (...) I cannot get over it, that the moon is not Queen of the sky by night, and the stars the lesser lights. It seems the Zeppelin is in the zenith of the night, golden like a moon, having taken control of the sky; and the bursting shells are the lesser lights.}}\n\n=====1916=====\nThe raids continued in 1916. In December 1915 additional P&nbsp;class Zeppelins and the first of the new Q&nbsp;class airships, were delivered. The Q&nbsp;class was an enlargement of the P&nbsp;class with improved ceiling and bomb-load.\n\nThe Army took full control of ground defences in February 1916, and a variety of sub 4-inch (less than 102&nbsp;mm) [[caliber|calibre]] guns were converted to [[anti-aircraft]] use. [[Searchlight]]s were introduced, initially manned by police. By mid-1916, there were 271 anti-aircraft guns and 258 searchlights across England. Aerial defences against Zeppelins were divided between the RNAS and the [[Royal Flying Corps]] (RFC), with the Navy engaging enemy airships approaching the coast while the RFC took responsibility once the enemy had crossed the coastline. Initially the War Office had believed that the Zeppelins used a layer of inert gas to protect themselves from incendiary bullets, and favoured the use of bombs or devices like the [[Ranken dart]]. However, by mid-1916 an effective mixture of explosive, tracer and incendiary rounds had been developed. There were 23 airship raids in 1916, in which 125 tons of bombs were dropped, killing 293 people and injuring 691.\n\n[[File:Zeppelin flagstone in the Grassmarket, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|upright|Zeppelin flagstone, Edinburgh]]\n[[File:Unexploded Zeppelin bomb, 1916.jpg|thumb|upright|Zeppelin bomb, on display at the [[National Museum of Flight]]]]\n[[File:Girder from zeppelin.jpg|thumb|Section of girder from Zeppelin shot down in England in 1916.

Nine Zeppelins were sent to Liverpool on the night of 31 January \u2013 1 February. A combination of poor weather and mechanical problems scattered them across the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] and several towns were bombed.

Ten airships set off on 31 March: most turned back and L&nbsp;15, damaged by antiaircraft fire and an aircraft attacking using Ranken darts, came down in the sea near Margate.

On the night of 2/3 April a six-airship raid was made, targeting the naval base at Rosyth, the [[Forth Bridge]] and London. None of the airships bombed their intended targets; 13 were killed, 24 injured and much of the \u00a377,113 damage was caused by the destruction of a warehouse in [[Leith]] containing whisky.<ref>Cole and Cheesman 1984 p. 122</ref><ref>Robinson 1971 p. 137</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/heritage/lost-edinburgh-zeppelin-air-raid-of-1916-1-3375536|title=Lost Edinburgh: Zeppelin Air Raid of 1916|last=McLean|first=David|date=14 April 2014|work=[[The Scotsman]]|accessdate=1 June 2014}}</ref> Raids on 4/5 April and 5/6 April had little effect,<ref>Cole and Cheesman 1984, p. 124</ref> as did a five-Zeppelin raid on 25/6 April and a raid by a single Army Zeppelin the following night.

Nine people were killed, 40 injured and \u00a3130,203 of damage was caused.<ref>Cole and Cheesman 1984, p.149</ref>\n\nZeppelins were very difficult to attack successfully at high altitude, although this also made accurate bombing impossible. Aeroplanes struggled to reach a typical altitude of {{Convert|10000|ft}}, and firing the solid bullets usually used by aircraft [[Lewis gun]]s was ineffectual: they made small holes causing inconsequential gas leaks. Britain developed new bullets, the Brock containing inflammable potassium chlorate, and the Buckingham filled with phosphorus, to ignite the potassium chlorate and hence the Zeppelin's hydrogen. These had become available by September 1916.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tees-37164689 |title=Leefe Robinson: The man who shot down a Baby Killer|website=BBC News |date=3 September 2016  |author= |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\nThe biggest raid to date was launched on 2\u20133 September, when twelve German Navy and four Army airships set out to bomb London. A combination of rain and snowstorms scattered the airships while they were still over the North Sea. Only one of the naval airships came within seven miles of central London, and both damage and casualties were slight. The newly commissioned [[Sch\u00fctte-Lanz#SL11|Sch\u00fctte-Lanz SL&nbsp;11]] dropped a few bombs on [[Hertfordshire]] while approaching London: it was picked up by searchlights as it bombed [[Ponders End]] and at around 02:15 it was intercepted by a [[Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2|B.E.2c]] flown by Lt. [[William Leefe Robinson]], who fired three 40-round drums of Brocks and Buckingham ammunition into the airship. The third drum started a fire and the airship was quickly enveloped in flames. It fell to the ground near [[Cuffley]], witnessed by the crews of several of the other Zeppelins and many on the ground; there were no survivors. The victory earned Leefe Robinson a Victoria Cross;<ref>Robinson 1971 pp 172\u20139</ref> the pieces of SL&nbsp;11 were gathered up and sold as souvenirs by the Red Cross to raise money for wounded soldiers.\n\n[[File:The End of the 'Baby-Killer'.png|thumb|upright|British propaganda postcard, entitled \"The End of the 'Baby-Killer'\"]]\nThe loss of SL&nbsp;11 to the new ammunition ended the German Army's enthusiasm for raids on Britain. The German Navy remained aggressive,<ref>Robinson 1971, p. 179</ref> and another 12-Zeppelin raid was launched on 23\u201324 September. Eight older airships bombed targets in the Midlands and northeast, while four R-class Zeppelins attacked London. L&nbsp;30 did not even cross the coast, dropping its bombs at sea. L&nbsp;31 approached London from the south, dropping a few bombs on the southern suburbs before crossing the Thames and bombing [[Leyton]], killing eight people and injuring 30. L&nbsp;32 also approached from the south: it dropped a few bombs on [[Sevenoaks]] and [[Swanley]] before crossing [[Purfleet]] at about 01:00. Shortly afterwards it was found by a BE2c piloted by 2nd Lieutenant [[Frederick Sowrey]] and set alight, coming down near [[Great Burstead]]. The entire crew was killed. L&nbsp;33 dropped a few incendiaries over [[Upminster]] and [[Bromley-by-Bow]], where it was hit by an anti-aircraft shell, despite being at an altitude of {{convert|13000|ft|m}}. As it headed towards Chelmsford it began to lose height and came down close to [[Little Wigborough]].<ref>Cole and Cheesman 1984, pp.167\u20138</ref>\nThe airship was set alight by its crew, but inspection of the wreckage provided the British with much information about the construction of Zeppelins, which was used in the design of the British [[R33-class airship]]s.\n\nThe next raid came on 1 October 1916. Eleven Zeppelins were launched at targets in the Midlands and at London. Only L&nbsp;31, commanded by the experienced Heinrich Mathy making his 15th raid, reached London. As the airship neared Cheshunt at about 23:20 it was picked up by searchlights and attacked by three aircraft from [[No. 39 Squadron RAF|No. 39 Squadron]]. 2nd lieutenant Wulstan Tempest succeeded in setting fire to the airship, which came down near Potters Bar. All 19 crew died, many jumping from the burning airship.<ref>Cole and Cheesman, pp. 174\u20136</ref>\n\nFor the next raid, on 27\u201328 November, the Zeppelins avoided London for targets in the Midlands. Again the defending aircraft were successful: L&nbsp;34 was shot down over the mouth of the Tees and L&nbsp;21 was attacked by two aircraft and crashed into the sea off [[Lowestoft]].<ref>Cole and Cheesman 1984, pp.180\u20131</ref> There were no further raids in 1916 although the Navy lost three more craft, all on 28 December: SL&nbsp;12 was destroyed at [[Ahlhorn]] by strong winds after sustaining damage in a poor landing, and at [[Tondern]] L&nbsp;24 crashed into the shed while landing: the resulting fire destroyed both L&nbsp;24 and the adjacent L&nbsp;17.<ref name=\"Whitehouse, Arch 1966, p. 182\">Whitehouse, Arch, ''The Zeppelin Fighters'', New York: Ace Books, 1966, no ISBN number, p. 182.</ref>\n\n=====1917=====\n[[File:Maschinengondel eines Zeppelin-Luftschiffes - Felix Schwormst\u00e4dt 1917.jpg|thumb|right|1917 watercolour by [[Felix Schwormst\u00e4dt]] \u2013 translated title: \"In the rear engine gondola of a Zeppelin airship during the flight through enemy airspace after a successful attack on England\"]]\n[[File:Zeppelin memorial, Camberwell Old Cemetery, June 2018.jpg|thumb|right|Memorial in [[Camberwell Cemeteries#Camberwell Old Cemetery|Camberwell Old Cemetery]], London, to 21 civilians killed by Zeppelin bombings in 1917]]\nTo counter the increasingly effective defences new Zeppelins were introduced which had an increased operating altitude of {{convert|16500|ft|m}} and a ceiling of {{convert|21000|ft|m}}. The first of these S-class Zeppelins, LZ&nbsp;91 (L&nbsp;42) entered service in February 1917.<ref>Robinson 1971, p. 389</ref> They were basically a modification of the R-class, sacrificing strength and power for improved altitude. The surviving R-class Zeppelins were adapted by removing one of the engines.<ref>Robinson 1971, p.208</ref> The improved safety was offset by the extra strain on the airship crews caused by altitude sickness and exposure to extreme cold and operating difficulties caused by cold and unpredictable high winds encountered at altitude.\n\nThe first raid of 1917 did not occur until 16\u201317 March: the five Zeppelins encountered very strong winds and none reached their targets.<ref>Cole and Cheesman 1984, p. 198.</ref> This experience was repeated on 23\u201324 May. Two days later 21 [[Gotha G.IV|Gotha bomber]]s attempted a daylight raid on London. They were frustrated by heavy cloud but the effort led the Kaiser to announce that airship raids on London were to stop; under pressure he later relented to allow the Zeppelins to attack under \"favourable circumstances\".\n\nOn 16\u201317 June, another raid was attempted. Six Zeppelins were to take part, but two were kept in their shed by high winds and another two were forced to return by engine failure. L&nbsp;42 bombed Ramsgate, hitting a munitions store. The month-old L&nbsp;48, the first U&nbsp;class Zeppelin, was forced to drop to {{convert|13000|ft|m}} where it was caught by four aircraft and destroyed, crashing near [[Theberton]], Suffolk.<ref>Cole and Cheesman, pp 250-4</ref>\n\nAfter ineffective raids on the Midlands and the north of England on 21\u201322 August and 24\u201325 September, the last major Zeppelin raid of the war was launched on 19\u201320 October, with 13 airships heading for [[Sheffield]], Manchester and [[Liverpool]]. All were hindered by an unexpected strong headwind at altitude. L&nbsp;45 was trying to reach Sheffield, but instead it dropped bombs on Northampton and London: most fell in the north-west suburbs but three 300&nbsp;kg (660&nbsp;lb) bombs fell in [[Piccadilly]], [[Camberwell]] and [[Hither Green]], causing most of the casualties that night. L&nbsp;45 then reduced altitude to try to escape the winds but was forced back into the higher air currents by a B.E.2e. The airship then had mechanical failure in three engines and was blown over France, eventually coming down near [[Sisteron]]; it was set on fire and the crew surrendered. L&nbsp;44 was brought down by ground fire over France: L&nbsp;49 and L&nbsp;50 were also lost to engine failure and the weather over France. L&nbsp;55 was badly damaged on landing and later scrapped.<ref>Cole and Cheesman 1984, pp. 345-6</ref>\n\nThere were no more raids in 1917, although the airships were not abandoned but refitted with new, more powerful, engines.\n\n=====1918=====\nThere were only four raids in 1918, all against targets in the Midlands and northern England. Five Zeppelins attempted to bomb the Midlands on 12\u20133 March to little effect. The following night three Zeppelins set off, but two turned back because of the weather: the third bombed [[Hartlepool]], killing eight and injuring 29.<ref>Robinson 1971, p. 308</ref> A five-Zeppelin raid on 12\u201313 April was also largely ineffective, with thick clouds making accurate navigation impossible. However some alarm was caused by the other two, one of which reached the east coast and bombed [[Wigan]], believing it was Sheffield: the other bombed [[Coventry]] in the belief that it was [[Birmingham]].<ref>Robinson 1971, pp. 308-13</ref> The final raid on 5 August 1918 involved four airships and resulted in the loss of ''L.70'' and the death of its entire crew under the command of ''Fregattenkapit\u00e4n'' [[Peter Strasser]], head of the Imperial German Naval Airship Service and the ''F\u00fchrer der Luftschiffe''. Crossing the North Sea during daylight, the airship was intercepted by a Royal Air Force [[Airco DH.4|DH.4]] [[biplane]] piloted by Major [[Egbert Cadbury]], and shot down in flames.<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1991|p=34.}}</ref>\n\n====Technological progress====\nZeppelin technology improved considerably as a result of the increasing demands of warfare. The company came under government control, and new personnel were recruited to cope with the increased demand, including the aerodynamicist [[Paul Jaray]] and the stress engineer [[Karl Arnstein]]. Many of these technological advances originated from Zeppelin's only serious competitor, the [[Mannheim]]-based Sch\u00fctte-Lanz company. While their dirigibles were never as successful, Professor Sch\u00fctte's more scientific approach to airship design led to important innovations including the streamlined hull shape, the simpler cruciform fins (replacing the more complicated box-like arrangements of older Zeppelins), individual direct-drive engine cars, anti-aircraft machine-gun positions,<ref>University of Constance. [http://www.uni-konstanz.de/FuF/Philo/Geschichte/MMAG/MMAG_Zeppelin/Gefahren/gefahren1.htm Gefahren und Strapazen der Luftschiffeins\u00e4tze] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604013824/http://www.uni-konstanz.de/FuF/Philo/Geschichte/MMAG/MMAG_Zeppelin/Gefahren/gefahren1.htm |date=4 June 2008 }}, upper platforms with machine-gun positions</ref> and gas ventilation shafts which transferred vented hydrogen to the top of the airship. New production facilities were set up to assemble Zeppelins from components fabricated in Friedrichshafen.<ref>Robinson 1973, pp. 89-90</ref>\n\nThe pre-war M-class designs were quickly enlarged, to produce the {{convert|536|ft|m|order=flip}} long duralumin P-class, which increased gas capacity from {{convert|794500|cuft|m3|order=flip|abbr=on}} to {{convert|1126000|cuft|m3|order=flip|abbr=on}}, introduced a fully enclosed gondola and had an extra engine. These modifications added {{convert|2000|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} to the maximum ceiling, around 9&nbsp;km/h (6&nbsp;mph) to the top speed, and greatly increased crew comfort and hence endurance. Twenty-two P-class airships were built; the first, LZ&nbsp;38, was delivered to the Army on 3 April 1915.<ref>Robinson 1973, pp. 95-100</ref> The P class was followed by a lengthened version, the Q class.\n\nIn July 1916 Luftschiffbau Zeppelin introduced the R-class, 199.49&nbsp;m (644&nbsp;ft 8&nbsp;in) long, and with a volume of {{convert|1949600|ft3|m3|order=flip|abbr=on}}. These could carry loads of three to four tons of bombs and reach speeds of up to {{convert|64|mph|kph|order=flip|abbr=on}}, powered by six {{convert|240|hp|kW|abbr=on}} [[Maybach]] engines.<ref>Robinson 1973, pp335\u20136</ref>\n\nIn 1917, following losses to the air defences over Britain, new designs were produced which were capable of flying at much higher altitudes, typically operating at around {{convert|20000|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}}. This was achieved by reducing the weight of the airship by reducing the weight of the structure, halving the bomb load, deleting the defensive armament and by reducing the number of engines to five.<ref>Robinson 1973, pp.127\u20138</ref> However these were not successful as bombers: the greater height at which they operated greatly hindered navigation, and their reduced power made them vulnerable to unfavorable weather conditions.\n\n[[File:IWMzeppelinspybasket.JPG|thumb|right|The [[spy basket|observation car]] preserved at the [[Imperial War Museum]] ]]\n\nAt the beginning of the war Captain [[Ernst A. Lehmann]] and Baron Gemmingen, Count Zeppelin's nephew, developed an [[Spy basket|observation car]] for use by dirigibles.<ref>Robinson 1973, pp. 93-4</ref> This was equipped with a wicker chair, chart table, electric lamp and compass, with telephone line and lightning conductor part of the suspension cable. The car's observer would relay navigation and bomb dropping orders to the Zeppelin flying within or above the clouds, so remaining invisible from the ground.<ref name=Lehmann>[[#Lehmann3|Lehmann, The Zeppelins]]</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|de Syon|2001|p=104.}}</ref> Although used by Army airships, they were not used by the Navy, since Strasser considered that their weight meant an unacceptable reduction in bomb load.<ref>Robinson 1971, pp. 68-9 (fn)</ref>\n\n====End of the war====\nThe German defeat also marked the end of German military dirigibles, as the victorious Allies demanded a complete abolition of German air forces and surrender of the remaining airships as [[war reparations|reparations]]. Specifically, the [[Treaty of Versailles]] contained the following articles dealing explicitly with dirigibles:\n\n;Article 198:\"The armed forces of Germany must not include any military or naval air forces&nbsp;... No dirigible shall be kept.\"\n;Article 202:\"On the coming into force of the present Treaty, all military and naval aeronautical material&nbsp;... must be delivered to the Governments of the Principal Allied and Associated Powers&nbsp;... In particular, this material will include all items under the following heads which are or have been in use or were designed for warlike purposes:\n:''[...]''\n:* \"Dirigibles able to take to the air, being manufactured, repaired or assembled.\"\n:* \"Plant for the manufacture of hydrogen.\"\n:* \"Dirigible sheds and shelters of every kind for aircraft.\"\n:\"Pending their delivery, dirigibles will, at the expense of Germany, be maintained inflated with hydrogen; the plant for the manufacture of hydrogen, as well as the sheds for dirigibles may at the discretion of the said Powers, be left to Germany until the time when the dirigibles are handed over.\"\n\nOn 23 June 1919, a week before the treaty was signed, many Zeppelin crews destroyed their airships in their halls in order to prevent delivery, following the example of the [[Scuttling of the German fleet at Scapa Flow]] two days earlier. The remaining dirigibles were transferred to France, Italy, Britain, and Belgium in 1920.\n\nA total of 84 Zeppelins were built during the war. Over 60 were lost, roughly evenly divided between accident and enemy action. 51 raids had been made on England alone,{{refn|The figures given total 54. While A. Whitehouse in ''The Zeppelin Fighters'' (1966) gives figures of 5,907 bombs dropped, 528 people killed, 1,156 wounded in 208 individual sorties.|group=N}} in which 5,806 bombs were dropped, killing 557 people and injuring 1,358 while causing damage estimated at \u00a31.5 million. It has been argued the raids were effective far beyond material damage in diverting and hampering wartime production: one estimate is that the due to the 1915\u201316 raids \"one sixth of the total normal output of munitions was entirely lost.\"<ref>Liddell Hart 1934, p. 76.</ref>\n\n===After World War I===\n====Renaissance====\n[[File:Airship Bodensee, Oct. 1919.jpg|thumbnail|The ''Bodensee'' 1919]]\n[[File:LZ121 Nordstern.jpg|thumbnail|The ''Nordstern'' 1920]]\nCount von Zeppelin had died in 1917, before the end of the war. Dr. [[Hugo Eckener]], who had long envisioned dirigibles as vessels of peace rather than of war, took command of the Zeppelin business, hoping to quickly resume civilian flights. Despite considerable difficulties, they completed two small passenger airships; [[Zeppelin LZ 120 Bodensee|LZ 120 ''Bodensee'']] {Scrapped July 1928}, which first flew in August 1919 and in the following months transported passengers between Friedrichshafen and Berlin, and a sister-ship ''LZ 121 Nordstern'', {Scrapped September 1926} which was intended for use on a regular route to [[Stockholm]].<ref>Robinson 1973, pp. 257-8</ref>\n\nHowever, in 1921 the Allied Powers demanded that these should be handed over as war reparations as compensation for the dirigibles destroyed by their crews in 1919. Germany was not allowed to construct military aircraft and only airships of less than {{convert|1000000|ft3|m3|order=flip|abbr=on}} were permitted. This brought a halt to Zeppelin's plans for airship development, and the company temporarily had to resort to manufacturing aluminium cooking utensils.<ref>Robinson 1973, p. 259</ref>\n\nEckener and his co-workers refused to give up and kept looking for investors and a way to circumvent Allied restrictions. Their opportunity came in 1924. The United States had started to experiment with rigid airships, constructing one of their own, the [[USS Shenandoah (ZR-1)|ZR-1 USS ''Shenandoah'']], and buying the [[R38 (ZR-2)|R38]] (based on the Zeppelin L&nbsp;70) when the British airship programme was cancelled. However, this broke apart and caught fire during a test flight above the [[Humber]] on 23 August 1921, killing 44 crewmen.<ref>Driggs, Laurence La Tourette.

Germany had to pay for this airship itself, as the cost was set against the war reparation accounts, but for the Zeppelin company this was unimportant. [[USS Los Angeles (ZR-3)|LZ&nbsp;126]] made its first flight on 27 August 1924.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename= U.S. Zeppelin on Trial|section=News in Brief |day_of_week= Friday|date=29 August 1924 |page_number= 9|issue=43743 |column=A }}</ref>\n\nOn 12 October at 07:30 local time the Zeppelin took off for the US under the command of Hugo Eckener.

It operated reliably for eight years until it was retired in 1932 for economic reasons. It was dismantled in August 1940.\n\n====Golden age====\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00834, Friedrichshafen, Luftschiff Graf Zeppelin.jpg|thumbnail|upright|''Graf Zeppelin'' under construction]]\nWith the delivery of ''LZ 126'', the Zeppelin company had reasserted its lead in rigid airship construction, but it was not yet quite back in business. In 1926 restrictions on airship construction were relaxed by the [[Locarno treaties]], but acquiring the necessary funds for the next project proved a problem in the difficult economic situation of post\u2013World War I Germany, and it took Eckener two years of lobbying and publicity work to secure the realization of ''LZ 127''.\n\nAnother two years passed before 18 September 1928, when the new dirigible, christened [[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|''Graf Zeppelin'']] in honour of the Count, flew for the first time.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename= Largest Zeppelin|section=News|day_of_week=  Wednesday|date=19 September 1928 |page_number= 14|issue=45002 |column=F }}</ref> With a total length of {{convert|236.6|m|ft}} and a volume of 105,000 m<sup>3</sup>, it was the largest dirigible to have been built at the time.\nEckener's initial purpose was to use ''Graf Zeppelin'' for experimental and demonstration purposes to prepare the way for regular airship traveling, carrying passengers and mail to cover the costs. In October 1928 its first long-range voyage brought it to Lakehurst, the voyage taking 112 hours and setting a new endurance record for airships.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename= The Zeppelin Flight|section=News|day_of_week= Tuesday|date=16 October 1928 |page_number= 16|issue= 45025 |column=A}}</ref> Eckener and his crew, which included his son Hans, were once more welcomed enthusiastically, with confetti parades in New York and another invitation to the White House. ''Graf Zeppelin'' toured Germany and visited Italy, [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and Spain. A second trip to the United States was aborted in France due to engine failure in May 1929.\n[[File:ZeppelinLZ127a.jpg|thumbnail|left|The ''Graf Zeppelin'']]\nIn August 1929 ''Graf Zeppelin'' departed for another daring enterprise: a [[circumnavigation]] of the globe. The growing popularity of the \"giant of the air\" made it easy for Eckener to find sponsors. One of these was the American press tycoon [[William Randolph Hearst]], who requested that the tour officially start in Lakehurst.<ref>Swinfield 2012, p.237</ref> As with the October 1928 flight to New York, Hearst had placed a reporter, [[Grace Marguerite Hay Drummond-Hay]], on board: she therefore became the first woman to circumnavigate the globe by air. From there, ''Graf Zeppelin'' flew to Friedrichshafen, then Tokyo, Los Angeles, and back to Lakehurst, in 21&nbsp;days 5&nbsp;hours and 31&nbsp;minutes. Including the initial and final trips between Friedrichshafen and Lakehurst and back, the dirigible had travelled {{convert|49618|km|mi}}.\n\n[[File:Graf Zeppelin stamp 65c 1930 issue.jpg|thumb|right|US Air Mail 1930 picturing Graf Zeppelin]]\nIn the following year, ''Graf Zeppelin'' undertook trips around Europe, and following a successful tour to [[Recife]], Brazil in May 1930, it was decided to open the first regular transatlantic airship line. This line operated between [[Frankfurt]] and Recife, and was later extended to [[Rio de Janeiro]], with a stop in Recife. Despite the beginning of the [[Great Depression]] and growing competition from fixed-wing aircraft, ''LZ 127'' transported an increasing volume of passengers and mail across the ocean every year until 1936. The ship made another spectacular voyage in July 1931 when it made a seven-day research trip to the [[Arctic]].<ref>Swinfield 2012, p. 239</ref>{{refn|Koestler was the only journalist on board.

This was to be powered by eight engines, {{convert|761|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} in length, with a capacity of {{convert|7062100|ft3|m3|order=flip|abbr=on}}. However the loss of the British passenger airship [[R101]] on 5 October 1930 led the Zeppelin company to reconsider the safety of hydrogen-filled vessels, and the design was abandoned in favour of a new project, LZ&nbsp;129. This was intended to be filled with [[Inert gas|inert]] [[helium]].<ref>Robinson 1973, p. 283</ref>\n\n====Hindenburg, end of an era====\n{{Main|LZ 129 Hindenburg}}\n[[File:Hindenburg at lakehurst.jpg|thumbnail|left|The ''Hindenburg'': note swastikas on tail fins.]]\nThe coming to power of the [[Nazi Party]] in 1933 had important consequences for Zeppelin Luftschiffbau. Zeppelins became a propaganda tool for the new regime: they would now display the Nazi [[swastika]] on their fins and occasionally tour Germany to play march music and propaganda speeches to the people. In 1934 [[Joseph Goebbels]], the Minister of Propaganda, contributed two million reichsmarks towards the construction of LZ&nbsp;129 and in 1935 [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] established a new airline directed by [[Ernst Lehmann]], the ''[[Deutsche Zeppelin Reederei]]'', as a subsidiary of ''[[Lufthansa]]'' to take over Zeppelin operations. Hugo Eckener was an outspoken anti-Nazi: complaints about the use of Zeppelins for propaganda purposes in 1936 led Goebbels to declare \"Dr.&nbsp;Eckener has placed himself outside the pale of society. Henceforth his name is not to be mentioned in the newspapers and his photograph is not to be published\".<ref>Robinson 1973, p.&nbsp;282</ref>\n\nOn 4&nbsp;March 1936 [[LZ 129 Hindenburg|LZ 129 ''Hindenburg'']] (named after former [[President of Germany]], [[Paul von Hindenburg]]) made its first flight. The ''Hindenburg'' was the largest airship ever built. It had been designed to use non-flammable helium, but the only supplies of the gas were controlled by the United States, which refused to allow its export.<ref>Robinson 1973, p.&nbsp;285</ref> So, in what proved to be a fatal decision, the ''Hindenburg'' was filled with flammable [[hydrogen]]. Apart from the propaganda missions, ''LZ&nbsp;129'' was used on the transatlantic service alongside ''Graf Zeppelin''.\n[[File:Hindenburg burning.jpg|thumb|The Hindenburg on fire in 1937]]\nOn 6&nbsp;May 1937, while landing in [[Naval Air Engineering Station Lakehurst|Lakehurst]] after a transatlantic flight, the tail of the ship caught fire, and within seconds, the ''Hindenburg'' burst into flames, killing 35 of the 97&nbsp;people on board and 1&nbsp;member of the ground crew. The cause of the fire has not been definitively determined. The investigation into the accident concluded that [[static electricity]] had ignited hydrogen which had leaked from the gasbags, although there were allegations of [[sabotage]]. 13&nbsp;passengers and 22&nbsp;crew, including Ernst Lehmann, were killed.<ref>Robinson 1973, pp&nbsp;291-294.</ref>\n\nDespite the apparent danger, there remained a list of 400&nbsp;people who still wanted to fly as Zeppelin passengers and had paid for the trip. Their money was refunded in 1940.\n\n''Graf Zeppelin'' was retired one month after the ''Hindenburg'' wreck and turned into a museum.<ref>Robinson 1974, p.&nbsp;294</ref> The intended new flagship Zeppelin was completed in 1938 and, inflated with hydrogen, made some test flights (the first on 14&nbsp;September), but never carried passengers.<ref>Robinson 1974, p.&nbsp;295</ref> Another project, ''LZ&nbsp;131'', designed to be even larger than ''Hindenburg'' and ''Graf Zeppelin&nbsp;II'', never progressed beyond the production of a few ring frames.\n\n''Graf Zeppelin&nbsp;II'' was assigned to the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' and made about 30 test flights prior to the beginning of World War II. Most of those flights were carried out near the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish]] border, first in the [[Sudeten mountains]] region of Silesia, then in the Baltic Sea region. During one such flight ''LZ&nbsp;130'' crossed the Polish border near the [[Hel Peninsula]], where it was intercepted by a Polish [[Lublin R-XIII]] aircraft from [[Puck, Poland|Puck]] naval airbase and forced to leave Polish airspace.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} During this time, ''LZ&nbsp;130'' was used for electronic scouting missions, and was equipped with various measuring equipment. In August 1939, it made a flight near the coastline of Great Britain in an attempt to determine whether the 100&nbsp;metre towers erected from [[Portsmouth]] to [[Scapa Flow]] were used for aircraft radio location.<ref>Robinson 1973, p.&nbsp;295</ref> Photography, radio wave interception, magnetic and radio frequency analysis were unable to detect operational British [[Chain Home]] [[radar]] due to searching in the wrong frequency range. The frequencies searched were too high, an assumption based on the Germans' own radar systems. The mistaken conclusion was that the British towers were not connected with radar operations, but were for naval radio communications.\n\nAfter the beginning of the Second World War on 1&nbsp;September, the ''Luftwaffe'' ordered LZ&nbsp;127 and ''LZ&nbsp;130'' moved to a large Zeppelin hangar in Frankfurt, where the skeleton of LZ&nbsp;131 was also located. In March 1940 G\u00f6ring ordered the scrapping of the remaining airships, and on 6&nbsp;May the Frankfurt hangars were demolished.<ref>Robinson 1973, p.&nbsp;296.</ref>\n\n==Cultural influences==\nZeppelins have been an inspiration to music, cinematography and literature.

Zeppelin's notions were first formulated in 1874<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Eckener 1938, pp. 155\u2013157.</ref> and developed in detail in 1893.<ref name=Doo187>Dooley 2004, p. A.187.</ref> They were patented in Germany in 1895 and in the United States in 1899.<ref name=\"Doo190\"/> After the outstanding success of the Zeppelin design, the word ''zeppelin'' came to be commonly used to refer to all rigid airships. Zeppelins were first flown commercially in 1910 by [[Deutsche Luftschiffahrts-AG]] (DELAG), the world's first airline in revenue service. By mid-1914, DELAG had carried over 10,000 fare-paying passengers on over 1,500 flights. During [[World War I]], the German military made extensive use of Zeppelins as bombers and scouts, killing over 500 people in bombing raids in Britain.<ref>Cole and Cheeseman 1984, p. 449.</ref>\n\nThe defeat of Germany in 1918 temporarily slowed down the airship business. Although DELAG established a scheduled daily service between [[Berlin]], [[Munich]], and [[Friedrichshafen]] in 1919, the airships built for this service eventually had to be surrendered under the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], which also prohibited Germany from building large airships. An exception was made allowing the construction of [[USS Los Angeles (ZR-3)|one airship for the US Navy]], which saved the company from extinction. In 1926 the restrictions on airship construction were lifted, and with the aid of donations from the public, work was started on the construction of [[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|LZ 127 ''Graf Zeppelin'']]. This revived the company's fortunes, and during the 1930s, the airships ''Graf Zeppelin'' and the larger [[LZ 129 Hindenburg|LZ 129 ''Hindenburg'']] operated regular [[transatlantic flight]]s from Germany to North America and Brazil. The [[Empire State Building#Dirigible (airship) terminal|Art Deco spire of the Empire State Building]] was originally designed to serve as a mooring mast for Zeppelins and other airships, although it was found that high winds made this impossible and the plan was abandoned.<ref name=\"WilliamsBlond2004\">{{cite book |author1=China Williams |author2=Becca Blond |title=New York State |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LyNJyEcFSJwC&pg=PA86 |year=2004 |publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74104-125-5 |page=86}}</ref> The [[Hindenburg disaster|''Hindenburg'' disaster]] in 1937, along with political and economic issues, hastened the demise of Zeppelins.\n\n==Principal characteristics==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=June 2018}}<!--4 paragraphs without citations-->\n[[File:Zeppelin-LZ-127 internal and gas cells.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|right|The pink ovals depict [[hydrogen]] cells inside the LZ 127, the magenta elements are ''[[Blaugas]]'' cells.

Retrieved: 20 July 2007.</ref> The advantage of this design was that the aircraft could be much larger than [[non-rigid airship]]s, which relied on a slight overpressure within the single pressure envelope to maintain their shape. The framework of most Zeppelins was made of [[duralumin]] (a combination of aluminum and copper as well as two or three other metals\u2014its exact content was kept a secret for years). Early Zeppelins used rubberised cotton for the gasbags, but most later craft used [[goldbeater's skin]], made from the intestines of cattle.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/02/29/a-new-generation-of-airships-is-born|title=A New Generation of Airships Is Born|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe first Zeppelins had long cylindrical hulls with tapered ends and complex multi-plane [[fin]]s. During World War&nbsp;I, following the lead of their rivals [[Sch\u00fctte-Lanz]] Luftschiffbau, the design changed to the more familiar streamlined shape with [[cruciform]] tail surfaces, as used by almost all later airships.\n\nThey were propelled by several [[internal combustion engine|engines]], mounted in [[airship#gondola|gondolas]] or engine cars, which were attached to the outside of the structural framework. Some of these could provide reverse thrust for manoeuvring while mooring.\n\nEarly models had a comparatively small externally mounted gondola for passengers and crew which was attached to the bottom of the frame. This space was never heated (fire outside of the kitchen was considered too risky) so passengers during trips across the North Atlantic or Siberia were forced to bundle themselves in blankets and furs to keep warm and were often miserable with the cold.\n\nBy the time of the ''Hindenburg'', several important changes had taken place: the passenger space had been relocated to the interior of the overall vessel, passenger rooms were insulated from the exterior by the dining area, and forced-warm air could be circulated from the water that cooled the forward engines, all of which made traveling much more comfortable; though it did deprive passengers of the views from the windows of their berths which had been a major attraction on the ''Graf Zeppelin''. On both the older and newer vessels, the external viewing windows were often opened during flight. The flight ceiling was so low that no pressurization of the cabins was necessary, though the ''Hindenburg'' did maintain a pressurized air-locked smoking room (no flame allowed, however\u2014a single electric lighter was provided, and could not be removed from the room).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.airships.net/hindenburg/interiors |title=The Hindenburg\u2019s Interior: Passenger Decks |last=Grossman |first=Dan |date=2009 |publisher=Airships.net}}</ref>\n\nAccess to Zeppelins was achieved in a number of ways. The ''Graf Zeppelin'''s gondola was accessed while the vessel was on the ground, via gangways. The ''Hindenburg'' also had passenger gangways leading from the ground directly into its hull, which could be withdrawn entirely, ground access to the gondola, and an exterior access hatch via its electrical room; this latter was intended for crew use only.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early designs===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1972-099-15, Ferdinand Graf Zeppelin am Schreibtisch.jpg|thumb|Ferdinand von Zeppelin]]\nCount [[Ferdinand von Zeppelin]]'s serious interest in airship development began in 1874, when he took inspiration from a lecture given by [[Heinrich von Stephan]] on the subject of \"World Postal Services and Air Travel\" to outline the basic principle of his later craft in a diary entry dated 25 March 1874.<ref name=Doo183>Dooley 2004, p.

Convinced of the potential importance of aviation, he started working on various designs in 1891, and had completed detailed designs by 1893. An official committee reviewed his plans in 1894,<ref name=Doo187/> and he received a patent, granted on 31 August 1895,<ref name=\"de Syon 18\">{{Harvnb|de Syon|2001|p=18.}}</ref> with [[Theodor Kober]] producing the technical drawings.<ref name=Doo190>Dooley 2004, p.

Zeppelin also sought support from the industrialist [[Carl Berg (airship builder)|Carl Berg]], then engaged in construction work on the second airship design of [[David Schwarz (aviation inventor)|David Schwarz]].

Responsibility for the detail design was given to Kober, whose place was later taken by [[Ludwig D\u00fcrr]], and construction of the first airship began in 1899 in a floating assembly-hall or hangar in the Bay of Manzell near [[Friedrichshafen]] on [[Lake Constance]] (the ''Bodensee''). The intention behind the floating hall was to facilitate the difficult task of bringing the airship out of the hall, as it could easily be aligned with the wind. The [[Zeppelin LZ 1|LZ 1]] (LZ for ''Luftschiff Zeppelin'', or \"Zeppelin Airship\") was {{convert|128|m|ft|sigfig=3}} long with a hydrogen capacity of {{convert| 400000 |ft3|m3|abbr=on|order=flip}}, was driven by two {{convert|15|hp|kW}} [[Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft|Daimler]] engines each driving a pair of propellers mounted either side of the envelope via [[bevel gear]]s and a driveshaft, and was controlled in pitch by moving a weight between its two [[nacelle]]s.<ref>Robinson 1971, p. 13</ref>\n\nThe first flight took place on 2 July 1900 over Lake Constance.<ref name=Dooley197>[[#Dooley|Dooley 2004]], pp. A.197\u2013A.198.</ref> Damaged during landing, it was repaired and modified and proved its potential in two subsequent flights made on 17 and 24 October 1900,<ref name=Dooley197/> bettering the 6&nbsp;[[Metre per second|m/s]] (21.6&nbsp;km/h, 13.4&nbsp;mph) velocity attained by the French airship ''La France''. Despite this performance, the [[shareholder]]s declined to invest more money, and so the company was liquidated, with Count von Zeppelin purchasing the ship and equipment. The Count wished to continue experimenting, but he eventually dismantled the ship in 1901.<ref name=Dooley197/><ref name=\"de Syon 25\">de Syon 2001, p. 25.</ref><!-- Dooley account differs from original de Syon cited text -->\n[[File:Zeppelin LZ 4 with stabilizers, 1908.jpg|thumb|Zeppelin LZ 4 with its multiple stabilizers, 1908]]\nDonations, the profits of a special [[lottery]], some public funding, a mortgage of Count von Zeppelin's wife's estate and a 100,000&nbsp;mark contribution by Count von Zeppelin himself allowed the construction of [[Zeppelin LZ 2|LZ 2]], which made only a single flight on 17 January 1906.<ref name=\"de Syon 26\">de Syon 2001, p. 26.</ref> After both engines failed it made a forced landing in the [[Allg\u00e4u]] mountains, where a storm subsequently damaged the anchored ship beyond repair.\n\nIncorporating all the usable parts of LZ&nbsp;2, its successor [[Zeppelin LZ 3|LZ 3]] became the first truly successful Zeppelin.

An attempt to complete the 24-hour trial flight ended when LZ&nbsp;4 had to make a landing at [[Leinfelden-Echterdingen|Echterdingen]] near [[Stuttgart]] because of mechanical problems. During the stop, a storm tore the airship away from its moorings on the afternoon of 5 August 1908. It crashed into a tree, caught fire, and quickly burnt out. No one was seriously injured.\n[[File:LZ4 after Echterdingen disaster.jpg|thumb|Wreckage of LZ&nbsp;4]]\nThis accident would have finished Zeppelin's experiments, but his flights had generated huge public interest and a sense of national pride regarding his work, and spontaneous donations from the public began pouring in, eventually totalling over six million marks.<ref>de Syon 2001, p. 38.</ref> This enabled the Count to found the ''[[Luftschiffbau Zeppelin|Luftschiffbau Zeppelin GmbH]]'' (Airship Construction Zeppelin Ltd.) and the [[Zeppelin Foundation]].\n\n===Before World War I===\n[[File:LZ7 passenger zeppelin mod.jpg|thumbnail|LZ 7 ''Deutschland'']]\nBefore World War I (1914\u20131918) the Zeppelin company manufactured 21 more airships.

In April 1913 its newly built sister-ship LZ&nbsp;15 (Z&nbsp;IV) accidentally intruded into French airspace owing to a navigational error caused by high winds and poor visibility. The commander judged it proper to land the airship to demonstrate that the incursion was accidental, and brought the ship down on the military parade-ground at [[Lun\u00e9ville]]. The airship remained on the ground until the following day, permitting a detailed examination by French airship experts.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times|articlename = The German Airship Incident|section= News|day_of_week= Saturday|date= 5 April 1913|page_number= 8|issue= 40178|column= B}}</ref>\n{{main|DELAG}}\nIn 1909 Count Zeppelin founded the world's first airline, the Deutsche Luftschiffahrts-Aktiengesellschaft (German Airship Travel Corporation), generally known as [[DELAG]]<ref name=\"Robinson 1971, p. 15\">Robinson 1971, p. 15</ref> to promote his airships, initially using LZ&nbsp;6, which he had hoped to sell to the German Army.

On 18 January 1913 Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]], Secretary of State of the German Imperial Naval Office, obtained the agreement of [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] to a five-year program of expansion of German naval-airship strength, involving the building of two airship bases and constructing a fleet of ten airships. The first airship of the program, L&nbsp;2, was ordered on 30 January. L&nbsp;1 was [[Helgoland Island air disaster|lost on 9 September]] near [[Heligoland]] when caught in a storm while taking part in an exercise with the German fleet. 14 crew members drowned, the first fatalities in a Zeppelin accident.<ref name=\"Robinson 1971, p. 25\">Robinson 1971, p. 25</ref> Less than six weeks later, on 17 October, [[Zeppelin LZ 18|LZ&nbsp;18]] (L&nbsp;2) caught fire during its acceptance trials, killing the entire crew.<ref name=\"Robinson 1971, p. 25\"/> These accidents deprived the Navy of most of its experienced personnel: the head of the Admiralty Air Department was killed in the L&nbsp;1 and his successor died in the L&nbsp;2. The Navy was left with three partially trained crews. The next Navy zeppelin, the M class L&nbsp;3 did not enter service until May 1914: in the meantime, ''Sachsen'' was hired from DELAG as a training ship.\n\nBy the outbreak of war in August 1914 Zeppelin had started constructing the first M class airships, which had a length of {{convert|518|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}}, with a volume of {{convert|794500|ft3|m3|order=flip}} and a useful load of {{convert|20100|lb|kg|order=flip}}.

By this time, it had already decommissioned three older Zeppelins, including Z&nbsp;I. During the war the Navy Zeppelins were mainly used in reconnaissance missions.<ref name=e>Boyne 2002, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FW_50wm8VnMC&lpg=PA256&dq=Zeppelin%20flew%20reconnaissance%20missions&pg=PA256#v=onepage&q=Zeppelin%20flew%20reconnaissance%20missions&f=false p. 256.]</ref> Bombing missions, especially those targeting London, captured the German public's imagination, but had little significant material success, although the Zeppelin raids, together with the later bombing raids carried out by aeroplanes, did cause the diversion of men and equipment from the Western Front and fear of the raids had some effect on industrial production.\n\nEarly offensive operations by Army airships revealed that they were extremely vulnerable to ground fire unless flown at high altitude, and several were lost. No bombs had been developed, and the early raids dropped artillery shells instead. On 5 August 1914 [[List of Zeppelins#LZ 21|Z&nbsp;VI]] bombed [[Li\u00e8ge]].

Three weeks later LZ&nbsp;35 suffered a similar fate after bombing [[Poperinghe]].<ref>Robinson 1973, p. 94</ref>\n\nParis mounted a more effective defense against zeppelin raids than London. Zeppelins attacking Paris had to first fly over the system of forts between the front and the city, from which they were subjected to antiaircraft fire with reduced risk of [[collateral damage]].  The French also maintained a continuous patrol of two fighters over Paris at an altitude from which they could promptly attack arriving zeppelins avoiding the delay required to reach the zeppelin altitude.<ref>{{cite book |last=March |first=Francis A. |authorlink = |title =History of the World War |url=https://archive.org/details/historyworldwar00beamgoog |publisher =The United Publishers of the United States and Canada |volume = |edition = |date =1919 |location =Philadelphia |page =[https://archive.org/details/historyworldwar00beamgoog/page/n422 419] |isbn =}}</ref> Two further missions were flown against Paris in January 1916: on 29 January LZ&nbsp;79 killed 23 and injured another 30 but was so severely damaged by anti-aircraft fire that it crashed during the return journey.

Two Navy zeppelins were transferred to [[Vai\u0146ode Air Base|Wainoden]] on the [[Courland Peninsula]]. A preliminary attempt to bomb [[Reval]] on 28 December ended in failure caused by operating problems due to the extreme cold, and one of the airships was destroyed in a forced landing at [[Serappen]]. The plan was subsequently abandoned.<ref>Robinson 1971, pp. 248-53</ref>\n\nIn 1917 the German High Command made an attempt to use a Zeppelin to deliver supplies to [[Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck|Lettow-Vorbeck's]] forces in [[East African Campaign (World War I)|German East Africa]]. [[List of Zeppelins#LZ 102|L&nbsp;57]], a specially lengthened craft was to have flown the mission but was destroyed shortly after completion. A Zeppelin then under construction, [[Zeppelin LZ104|L&nbsp;59]], was then modified for the mission: it set off from Yambol on 21 November 1917 and nearly reached its destination, but was ordered to return by radio. Its journey covered {{convert|6400|km|mi|abbr=on}} and lasted 95 hours. It was then used for reconnaissance and bombing missions in the eastern Mediterranean. It flew one bombing mission against [[Naples]] on 10\u201311 March 1918. A planned attack on [[Suez]] was turned back by high winds, and on 7 April 1918 it was on a mission to bomb the British naval base at [[Malta]] when it caught fire over the [[Straits of Otranto]], with the loss of all its crew.\n\nOn 5&nbsp;January 1918, a fire at Ahlhorn destroyed four of the specialised double sheds along with four Zeppelins and one Sch\u00fctte-Lanz. In July 1918, the [[Tondern raid]] conducted by the RAF and Royal Navy, destroyed two Zeppelins in their sheds.\n\n====1914\u201318 naval patrols====\n[[File:SMS Seydlitz mit Zeppelin.jpg|thumbnail|A Zeppelin flying over [[SMS Seydlitz|SMS ''Seydlitz'']]]]\n\nThe main use of the airship was in reconnaissance over the [[North Sea]] and the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]], and the majority of airships manufactured were used by the Navy. Patrolling had priority over any other airship activity.<ref name=Lehmann6>[[#Lehmann|Lehmann Chapter VI]]</ref> During the war almost 1,000 missions were flown over the North Sea alone,<ref name=e /> compared to about 50 strategic bombing raids. The German Navy had some 15 Zeppelins in commission by the end of 1915 and was able to have two or more patrolling continuously at any one time. However their operations were limited by weather conditions. On 16 February L&nbsp;3 and L&nbsp;4 were lost owing to a combination of engine failure and high winds, L&nbsp;3 crashing on the Danish island of [[Fan\u00f8]] without loss of life and L&nbsp;4 coming down at [[Bl\u00e5vandshuk|Blaavands Huk]]; eleven crew escaped from the forward gondola, after which the lightened airship with four crew members remaining in the aft engine car was blown out to sea and lost.<ref>Robinson 1971, pp. 83-4</ref>\n\nAt this stage in the war there was no clear doctrine for the use of Naval airships. A single Zeppelin, L&nbsp;5, played an unimportant part in the [[Battle of Dogger Bank (1915)|Battle of the Dogger Bank]] on 24 January 1915. L&nbsp;5 was carrying out a routine patrol when it picked up [[Franz von Hipper|Admiral Hipper]]'s radio signal announcing that he was engaged with the British battle cruiser squadron. Heading towards the German fleet's position, the Zeppelin was forced to climb above the cloud cover by fire from the British fleet: its commander then decided that it was his duty to cover the retreating German fleet rather than observe British movements.<ref>Robinson 1971, pp81-2</ref>\n\nIn 1915 patrols were only carried out on 124 days, and in other years the total was considerably less.<ref>Robinson 1971, p 350</ref> They prevented British ships from approaching Germany, spotted when and where the British were laying mines and later aided in the destruction of those mines.<ref name=Lehmann6/> Zeppelins would sometimes land on the sea next to a minesweeper, bring aboard an officer and show him the mines' locations.<ref name=Lehmann6/>\n\nIn 1917 the British Navy began to take effective countermeasures against airship patrols over the North Sea. In April the first [[Curtiss Model H|Curtiss H.12 \"Large America\"]] long-range [[flying boats]] were delivered to [[RNAS Felixstowe]], and in July 1917 the aircraft carrier [[HMS Furious (47)|HMS ''Furious'']] entered service, and launching platforms for aeroplanes were fitted to the forward turrets of some light cruisers. On 14 May L&nbsp;22 was shot down near [[Terschelling|Terschelling Bank]] by an H.12 flown by Lt. Galpin and Sub-Lt. Leckie which had been alerted following interception of its radio traffic.<ref>Robinson 1971, pp. 233-5</ref> Two further unsuccessful interceptions were made by Galpin and Leckie on 24 May and 5 June, and on 14 June L&nbsp;43 was brought down by an H.12 flown by Sub Lts. Hobbs and Dickie. On the same day Galpin and Leckie intercepted and attacked L&nbsp;46. The Germans had believed that the previous unsuccessful attacks had been made by an aircraft operating from one of the British Navy's seaplane carriers: now realising that there was a new threat, Strasser ordered airships patrolling in the Terschilling area to maintain an altitude of at least 4,000&nbsp;m (13,000&nbsp;ft), considerably reducing their effectiveness.<ref>Robinson 1971, p.241</ref> On 21 August L&nbsp;23, patrolling off the Danish coast, was spotted by the British 3rd Light Cruiser squadron which was in the area. {{HMS|Yarmouth|1911|6}} launched its [[Sopwith Pup]], and Sub-Lt. B. A. Smart succeeded in shooting the Zeppelin down in flames. The cause of the airship's loss was not discovered by the Germans, who believed the Zeppelin had been brought down by antiaircraft fire from surface ships.<ref>Robinson 1971, pp. 243-4</ref>\n\n====Bombing campaign against Britain====\n{{further|German strategic bombing during World War I}}\n[[File:It is far better to face the bullets.jpg|thumb|right|upright|British First World War poster of a Zeppelin above London at night]]\n\nAt the beginning of the conflict the German command had high hopes for the airships, which were considerably more capable than contemporary light fixed-wing machines: they were almost as fast, could carry multiple machine guns, and had enormously greater [[bomb]]-load range and endurance. Contrary to expectation, it was not easy to ignite the hydrogen using standard bullets and shrapnel. The Allies only started to exploit the Zeppelin's great vulnerability to fire when a combination of [[Pomeroy bullet|Pomeroy]] and [[Frank Arthur Brock|Brock]] explosive ammunition with Buckingham [[incendiary ammunition]] was used in [[fighter aircraft]] machine guns during 1916.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/FlightPDFArchive/1919/1919%20-%200895.PDF |title=The Brock Bullet Claim |last= |first= |website=flightglobal.com |publisher=Flight Aircraft Engineer Magazine |accessdate=12 August 2018 }}</ref> The British had been concerned over the threat posed by Zeppelins since 1909, and attacked the Zeppelin bases early in the war.

London: Putnam, 4th ed, 1978. {{ISBN|0-370-30021-1}} p. 286</ref> and the sheds at Cologne as well as the Zeppelin works in Friedrichshafen were also attacked. These raids were followed by the [[Cuxhaven Raid]] on Christmas Day 1914, one of the first operations carried out by ship-launched aeroplanes.\n\nAirship raids on Great Britain were approved by the [[William II of Germany|Kaiser]] on 7 January 1915, although he excluded London as a target and further demanded that no attacks be made on historic buildings.<ref>Robinson 1971, pp. 55-6</ref> The raids were intended to target only military sites on the east coast and around the Thames estuary, but bombing accuracy was poor owing to the height at which the airships flew and navigation was problematic. The airships relied largely on [[dead reckoning]], supplemented by a radio direction-finding system of limited accuracy. After [[Blackout (wartime)|blackout]]s became widespread, many bombs fell at random on uninhabited countryside.\n\n=====1915=====\nThe first raid on England took place on the night of 19\u201320 January 1915. Two Zeppelins, L&nbsp;3 and L&nbsp;4, intended to attack [[Humberside]] but, diverted by strong winds, eventually dropped their bombs on [[Great Yarmouth]], [[Sheringham]], [[King's Lynn]] and the surrounding villages, killing four and injuring 16. Material damage was estimated at \u00a37,740.<ref>Cole and Cheesman, 1984, p. 24</ref>\n\nThe Kaiser authorised the bombing of the London docks on 12 February 1915,<ref>Robinson 1971, p. 67</ref> but no raids on London took place until May. Two Navy raids failed due to bad weather on 14 and 15 April, and it was decided to delay further attempts until the more capable [[Zeppelin P Class|P class Zeppelins]] were in service. The Army received the first of these, LZ&nbsp;38, and Erich Linnarz commanded it on a raid over [[Ipswich]] on 29\u201330 April and another, attacking [[Southend]] on 9\u201310 May. LZ&nbsp;38 also attacked [[Dover]] and [[Ramsgate]] on 16\u201317 May, before returning to bomb Southend on 26\u201327 May. These four raids killed six people and injured six, causing property damage estimated at \u00a316,898.<ref name=\"cole p51-55\">Cole and Cheesman 1984, pp. 51\u201355.</ref> Twice Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) aircraft tried to intercept LZ&nbsp;38 but on both occasions it was either able to outclimb the aircraft or was already at too great an altitude for the aircraft to intercept.\n\nOn 31 May Linnarz commanded LZ&nbsp;38 on the first raid against London. In total some 120 bombs were dropped on a line stretching from [[Stoke Newington]] south to [[Stepney]] and then north toward [[Leytonstone]]. Seven people were killed and 35 injured. 41 fires were started, burning out seven buildings and the total damage was assessed at \u00a318,596. Aware of the problems that the Germans were experiencing in navigation, this raid caused the government to issue a [[D notice]] prohibiting the press from reporting anything about raids that was not mentioned in official statements. Only one of the 15 defensive sorties managed to make visual contact with the enemy, and one of the pilots, Flt Lieut D. M. Barnes, was killed on attempting to land.<ref>Cole and Cheesman, 1984, pp. 56-8</ref>\n\nThe first naval attempt on London took place on 4 June: strong winds caused the commander of L&nbsp;9 to misjudge his position, and the bombs were dropped on [[Gravesend, Kent|Gravesend]]. L&nbsp;9 was also diverted by the weather on 6\u20137 June, attacking [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] instead of London and causing considerable damage.<ref>Cole and Cheesman 1984, p.60</ref> On the same night an Army raid of three Zeppelins also failed because of the weather, and as the airships returned to Evere (Brussels) they ran into a counter-raid by RNAS aircraft flying from [[Veurne|Furnes]], Belgium. LZ&nbsp;38 was destroyed on the ground and LZ&nbsp;37 was intercepted in the air by [[Reginald Alexander John Warneford|R. A. J. Warneford]], who dropped six bombs on the airship, setting it on fire. All but one of the crew died. Warneford was awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] for his achievement. As a consequence of the RNAS raid both the Army and Navy withdrew from their bases in Belgium.<ref>Robinson 1971, p. 77</ref>\n\nAfter an ineffective attack by L&nbsp;10 on [[Tyneside]] on 15\u201316 June the short summer nights discouraged further raids for some months, and the remaining Army Zeppelins were reassigned to the Eastern and Balkan fronts. The Navy resumed raids on Britain in August, when three largely ineffective raids were carried out. On 10 August the antiaircraft guns had their first success, causing L&nbsp;12 to come down into the sea off [[Zeebrugge]],<ref>Cole and Cheesman pp. 64-7</ref> and on 17\u201318 August L&nbsp;10 became the first Navy airship to reach London. Mistaking the reservoirs of the [[Lea Valley]] for the Thames, it dropped its bombs on [[Walthamstow]] and Leytonstone.<ref>Cole and Cheesman 1984, p. 68</ref> L&nbsp;10 was destroyed a little over two weeks later: it was struck by lightning and caught fire off [[Cuxhaven]], and the entire crew was killed.<ref>Robinson 1971, p. 384.</ref> Three Army airships set off to bomb London on 7\u20138 September, of which two succeeded: SL&nbsp;2 dropped bombs between [[Southwark]] and [[Woolwich]]: LZ&nbsp;74 scattered 39 bombs over [[Cheshunt]] before heading on to London and dropping a single bomb on [[Fenchurch Street station]].\n\n[[File:Zeppelin Raid plaque, 61 Farringdon Road, London, England, IMG 5217 edit.jpg|thumb|left|A commemorative plaque at 61 [[Farringdon Road]], London]]\n\nThe Navy attempted to follow up the Army's success the following night. One Zeppelin targeted the benzol plant at [[Skinningrove]] and three set off to bomb London: two were forced to turn back but L&nbsp;13, commanded by ''Kapit\u00e4nleutnant'' Heinrich Mathy reached London. The bomb-load included a {{convert|300|kg|lb}} bomb, the largest yet carried. This exploded near [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield Market]], destroying several houses and killing two men. More bombs fell on the textile warehouses north of [[St Paul's Cathedral]], causing a fire which despite the attendance of 22 fire engines caused over half a million pounds of damage: Mathy then turned east, dropping his remaining bombs on [[Liverpool Street station]]. The Zeppelin was the target of concentrated antiaircraft fire, but no hits were scored and the falling shrapnel caused both damage and alarm on the ground. The raid killed 22 people and injured 87.<ref>Cross 1991, p. 35.</ref> The monetary damage was over one sixth of the total damage inflicted by bombing raids during the war.<ref>Robinson 1971 p. 109</ref>\n\nAfter three more raids were scattered by the weather, a five-Zeppelin raid was launched by the Navy on 13 October, the \"Theatreland Raid.\" Arriving over the Norfolk coast at around 18:30, the Zeppelins encountered new ground defences installed since the September raid; these had no success, although the airship commanders commented on the improved defences of the city.<ref>Robinson 1971, p. 117</ref> L&nbsp;15 began bombing over [[Charing Cross]], the first bombs striking the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]] and the corner of Exeter and Wellington Streets, killing 17 and injuring 20. None of the other Zeppelins reached central London: bombs fell on Woolwich, [[Guildford]], [[Tonbridge]], [[Croydon]], [[Hertford]] and an army camp near Folkestone. A total of 71 people were killed and 128 injured.<ref>Cole and Cheesman 1984, p. 73</ref> This was the last raid of 1915, as bad weather coincided with the new moon in both November and December 1915 and continued into January 1916.\n\nAlthough these raids had no significant military impact, the psychological effect was considerable. The writer [[D. H. Lawrence]] described one raid in a letter to [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]]:<ref>Boulton, 2000, p. 106.</ref>\n{{quote|Then we saw the Zeppelin above us, just ahead, amid a gleaming of clouds: high up, like a bright golden finger, quite small (...)

I cannot get over it, that the moon is not Queen of the sky by night, and the stars the lesser lights. It seems the Zeppelin is in the zenith of the night, golden like a moon, having taken control of the sky; and the bursting shells are the lesser lights.}}\n\n=====1916=====\nThe raids continued in 1916. In December 1915 additional P&nbsp;class Zeppelins and the first of the new Q&nbsp;class airships, were delivered. The Q&nbsp;class was an enlargement of the P&nbsp;class with improved ceiling and bomb-load.\n\nThe Army took full control of ground defences in February 1916, and a variety of sub 4-inch (less than 102&nbsp;mm) [[caliber|calibre]] guns were converted to [[anti-aircraft]] use. [[Searchlight]]s were introduced, initially manned by police. By mid-1916, there were 271 anti-aircraft guns and 258 searchlights across England. Aerial defences against Zeppelins were divided between the RNAS and the [[Royal Flying Corps]] (RFC), with the Navy engaging enemy airships approaching the coast while the RFC took responsibility once the enemy had crossed the coastline. Initially the War Office had believed that the Zeppelins used a layer of inert gas to protect themselves from incendiary bullets, and favoured the use of bombs or devices like the [[Ranken dart]]. However, by mid-1916 an effective mixture of explosive, tracer and incendiary rounds had been developed. There were 23 airship raids in 1916, in which 125 tons of bombs were dropped, killing 293 people and injuring 691.\n\n[[File:Zeppelin flagstone in the Grassmarket, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|upright|Zeppelin flagstone, Edinburgh]]\n[[File:Unexploded Zeppelin bomb, 1916.jpg|thumb|upright|Zeppelin bomb, on display at the [[National Museum of Flight]]]]\n[[File:Girder from zeppelin.jpg|thumb|Section of girder from Zeppelin shot down in England in 1916.

Nine Zeppelins were sent to Liverpool on the night of 31 January \u2013 1 February. A combination of poor weather and mechanical problems scattered them across the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] and several towns were bombed.

On the night of 2/3 April a six-airship raid was made, targeting the naval base at Rosyth, the [[Forth Bridge]] and London. None of the airships bombed their intended targets; 13 were killed, 24 injured and much of the \u00a377,113 damage was caused by the destruction of a warehouse in [[Leith]] containing whisky.<ref>Cole and Cheesman 1984 p. 122</ref><ref>Robinson 1971 p. 137</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/heritage/lost-edinburgh-zeppelin-air-raid-of-1916-1-3375536|title=Lost Edinburgh: Zeppelin Air Raid of 1916|last=McLean|first=David|date=14 April 2014|work=[[The Scotsman]]|accessdate=1 June 2014}}</ref> Raids on 4/5 April and 5/6 April had little effect,<ref>Cole and Cheesman 1984, p. 124</ref> as did a five-Zeppelin raid on 25/6 April and a raid by a single Army Zeppelin the following night.

The 10-Zeppelin raid achieved very little; four turned back early and the rest wandered over a fog-covered landscape before giving up.<ref>Cole and Cheesman, p. 139</ref> Adverse weather dispersed raids on 30\u201331 July and 2\u20133 August, and on 8\u20139 August nine airships attacked Hull with little effect.<ref>Cole and Cheesman 1984, p. 145</ref> On 24\u201325 August 12 Navy Zeppelins were launched: eight turned back without attacking and only Heinrich Mathy's L&nbsp;31 reached London; flying above low clouds, 36 bombs were dropped in 10 minutes on south east London. Nine people were killed, 40 injured and \u00a3130,203 of damage was caused.<ref>Cole and Cheesman 1984, p.149</ref>\n\nZeppelins were very difficult to attack successfully at high altitude, although this also made accurate bombing impossible. Aeroplanes struggled to reach a typical altitude of {{Convert|10000|ft}}, and firing the solid bullets usually used by aircraft [[Lewis gun]]s was ineffectual: they made small holes causing inconsequential gas leaks. Britain developed new bullets, the Brock containing inflammable potassium chlorate, and the Buckingham filled with phosphorus, to ignite the potassium chlorate and hence the Zeppelin's hydrogen. These had become available by September 1916.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tees-37164689 |title=Leefe Robinson: The man who shot down a Baby Killer|website=BBC News |date=3 September 2016  |author= |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\nThe biggest raid to date was launched on 2\u20133 September, when twelve German Navy and four Army airships set out to bomb London. A combination of rain and snowstorms scattered the airships while they were still over the North Sea. Only one of the naval airships came within seven miles of central London, and both damage and casualties were slight. The newly commissioned [[Sch\u00fctte-Lanz#SL11|Sch\u00fctte-Lanz SL&nbsp;11]] dropped a few bombs on [[Hertfordshire]] while approaching London: it was picked up by searchlights as it bombed [[Ponders End]] and at around 02:15 it was intercepted by a [[Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2|B.E.2c]] flown by Lt. [[William Leefe Robinson]], who fired three 40-round drums of Brocks and Buckingham ammunition into the airship. The third drum started a fire and the airship was quickly enveloped in flames. It fell to the ground near [[Cuffley]], witnessed by the crews of several of the other Zeppelins and many on the ground; there were no survivors. The victory earned Leefe Robinson a Victoria Cross;<ref>Robinson 1971 pp 172\u20139</ref> the pieces of SL&nbsp;11 were gathered up and sold as souvenirs by the Red Cross to raise money for wounded soldiers.\n\n[[File:The End of the 'Baby-Killer'.png|thumb|upright|British propaganda postcard, entitled \"The End of the 'Baby-Killer'\"]]\nThe loss of SL&nbsp;11 to the new ammunition ended the German Army's enthusiasm for raids on Britain. The German Navy remained aggressive,<ref>Robinson 1971, p. 179</ref> and another 12-Zeppelin raid was launched on 23\u201324 September. Eight older airships bombed targets in the Midlands and northeast, while four R-class Zeppelins attacked London. L&nbsp;30 did not even cross the coast, dropping its bombs at sea. L&nbsp;31 approached London from the south, dropping a few bombs on the southern suburbs before crossing the Thames and bombing [[Leyton]], killing eight people and injuring 30. L&nbsp;32 also approached from the south: it dropped a few bombs on [[Sevenoaks]] and [[Swanley]] before crossing [[Purfleet]] at about 01:00. Shortly afterwards it was found by a BE2c piloted by 2nd Lieutenant [[Frederick Sowrey]] and set alight, coming down near [[Great Burstead]]. The entire crew was killed. L&nbsp;33 dropped a few incendiaries over [[Upminster]] and [[Bromley-by-Bow]], where it was hit by an anti-aircraft shell, despite being at an altitude of {{convert|13000|ft|m}}. As it headed towards Chelmsford it began to lose height and came down close to [[Little Wigborough]].<ref>Cole and Cheesman 1984, pp.167\u20138</ref>\nThe airship was set alight by its crew, but inspection of the wreckage provided the British with much information about the construction of Zeppelins, which was used in the design of the British [[R33-class airship]]s.\n\nThe next raid came on 1 October 1916. Eleven Zeppelins were launched at targets in the Midlands and at London. Only L&nbsp;31, commanded by the experienced Heinrich Mathy making his 15th raid, reached London. As the airship neared Cheshunt at about 23:20 it was picked up by searchlights and attacked by three aircraft from [[No. 39 Squadron RAF|No. 39 Squadron]]. 2nd lieutenant Wulstan Tempest succeeded in setting fire to the airship, which came down near Potters Bar. All 19 crew died, many jumping from the burning airship.<ref>Cole and Cheesman, pp. 174\u20136</ref>\n\nFor the next raid, on 27\u201328 November, the Zeppelins avoided London for targets in the Midlands. Again the defending aircraft were successful: L&nbsp;34 was shot down over the mouth of the Tees and L&nbsp;21 was attacked by two aircraft and crashed into the sea off [[Lowestoft]].<ref>Cole and Cheesman 1984, pp.180\u20131</ref> There were no further raids in 1916 although the Navy lost three more craft, all on 28 December: SL&nbsp;12 was destroyed at [[Ahlhorn]] by strong winds after sustaining damage in a poor landing, and at [[Tondern]] L&nbsp;24 crashed into the shed while landing: the resulting fire destroyed both L&nbsp;24 and the adjacent L&nbsp;17.<ref name=\"Whitehouse, Arch 1966, p. 182\">Whitehouse, Arch, ''The Zeppelin Fighters'', New York: Ace Books, 1966, no ISBN number, p. 182.</ref>\n\n=====1917=====\n[[File:Maschinengondel eines Zeppelin-Luftschiffes - Felix Schwormst\u00e4dt 1917.jpg|thumb|right|1917 watercolour by [[Felix Schwormst\u00e4dt]] \u2013 translated title: \"In the rear engine gondola of a Zeppelin airship during the flight through enemy airspace after a successful attack on England\"]]\n[[File:Zeppelin memorial, Camberwell Old Cemetery, June 2018.jpg|thumb|right|Memorial in [[Camberwell Cemeteries#Camberwell Old Cemetery|Camberwell Old Cemetery]], London, to 21 civilians killed by Zeppelin bombings in 1917]]\nTo counter the increasingly effective defences new Zeppelins were introduced which had an increased operating altitude of {{convert|16500|ft|m}} and a ceiling of {{convert|21000|ft|m}}. The first of these S-class Zeppelins, LZ&nbsp;91 (L&nbsp;42) entered service in February 1917.<ref>Robinson 1971, p. 389</ref> They were basically a modification of the R-class, sacrificing strength and power for improved altitude. The surviving R-class Zeppelins were adapted by removing one of the engines.<ref>Robinson 1971, p.208</ref> The improved safety was offset by the extra strain on the airship crews caused by altitude sickness and exposure to extreme cold and operating difficulties caused by cold and unpredictable high winds encountered at altitude.\n\nThe first raid of 1917 did not occur until 16\u201317 March: the five Zeppelins encountered very strong winds and none reached their targets.<ref>Cole and Cheesman 1984, p. 198.</ref> This experience was repeated on 23\u201324 May. Two days later 21 [[Gotha G.IV|Gotha bomber]]s attempted a daylight raid on London. They were frustrated by heavy cloud but the effort led the Kaiser to announce that airship raids on London were to stop; under pressure he later relented to allow the Zeppelins to attack under \"favourable circumstances\".\n\nOn 16\u201317 June, another raid was attempted. Six Zeppelins were to take part, but two were kept in their shed by high winds and another two were forced to return by engine failure. L&nbsp;42 bombed Ramsgate, hitting a munitions store. The month-old L&nbsp;48, the first U&nbsp;class Zeppelin, was forced to drop to {{convert|13000|ft|m}} where it was caught by four aircraft and destroyed, crashing near [[Theberton]], Suffolk.<ref>Cole and Cheesman, pp 250-4</ref>\n\nAfter ineffective raids on the Midlands and the north of England on 21\u201322 August and 24\u201325 September, the last major Zeppelin raid of the war was launched on 19\u201320 October, with 13 airships heading for [[Sheffield]], Manchester and [[Liverpool]]. All were hindered by an unexpected strong headwind at altitude. L&nbsp;45 was trying to reach Sheffield, but instead it dropped bombs on Northampton and London: most fell in the north-west suburbs but three 300&nbsp;kg (660&nbsp;lb) bombs fell in [[Piccadilly]], [[Camberwell]] and [[Hither Green]], causing most of the casualties that night. L&nbsp;45 then reduced altitude to try to escape the winds but was forced back into the higher air currents by a B.E.2e. The airship then had mechanical failure in three engines and was blown over France, eventually coming down near [[Sisteron]]; it was set on fire and the crew surrendered. L&nbsp;44 was brought down by ground fire over France: L&nbsp;49 and L&nbsp;50 were also lost to engine failure and the weather over France. L&nbsp;55 was badly damaged on landing and later scrapped.<ref>Cole and Cheesman 1984, pp. 345-6</ref>\n\nThere were no more raids in 1917, although the airships were not abandoned but refitted with new, more powerful, engines.\n\n=====1918=====\nThere were only four raids in 1918, all against targets in the Midlands and northern England. Five Zeppelins attempted to bomb the Midlands on 12\u20133 March to little effect. The following night three Zeppelins set off, but two turned back because of the weather: the third bombed [[Hartlepool]], killing eight and injuring 29.<ref>Robinson 1971, p. 308</ref> A five-Zeppelin raid on 12\u201313 April was also largely ineffective, with thick clouds making accurate navigation impossible. However some alarm was caused by the other two, one of which reached the east coast and bombed [[Wigan]], believing it was Sheffield: the other bombed [[Coventry]] in the belief that it was [[Birmingham]].<ref>Robinson 1971, pp. 308-13</ref> The final raid on 5 August 1918 involved four airships and resulted in the loss of ''L.70'' and the death of its entire crew under the command of ''Fregattenkapit\u00e4n'' [[Peter Strasser]], head of the Imperial German Naval Airship Service and the ''F\u00fchrer der Luftschiffe''. Crossing the North Sea during daylight, the airship was intercepted by a Royal Air Force [[Airco DH.4|DH.4]] [[biplane]] piloted by Major [[Egbert Cadbury]], and shot down in flames.<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1991|p=34.}}</ref>\n\n====Technological progress====\nZeppelin technology improved considerably as a result of the increasing demands of warfare. The company came under government control, and new personnel were recruited to cope with the increased demand, including the aerodynamicist [[Paul Jaray]] and the stress engineer [[Karl Arnstein]]. Many of these technological advances originated from Zeppelin's only serious competitor, the [[Mannheim]]-based Sch\u00fctte-Lanz company. While their dirigibles were never as successful, Professor Sch\u00fctte's more scientific approach to airship design led to important innovations including the streamlined hull shape, the simpler cruciform fins (replacing the more complicated box-like arrangements of older Zeppelins), individual direct-drive engine cars, anti-aircraft machine-gun positions,<ref>University of Constance.

New production facilities were set up to assemble Zeppelins from components fabricated in Friedrichshafen.<ref>Robinson 1973, pp. 89-90</ref>\n\nThe pre-war M-class designs were quickly enlarged, to produce the {{convert|536|ft|m|order=flip}} long duralumin P-class, which increased gas capacity from {{convert|794500|cuft|m3|order=flip|abbr=on}} to {{convert|1126000|cuft|m3|order=flip|abbr=on}}, introduced a fully enclosed gondola and had an extra engine. These modifications added {{convert|2000|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} to the maximum ceiling, around 9&nbsp;km/h (6&nbsp;mph) to the top speed, and greatly increased crew comfort and hence endurance. Twenty-two P-class airships were built; the first, LZ&nbsp;38, was delivered to the Army on 3 April 1915.<ref>Robinson 1973, pp. 95-100</ref> The P class was followed by a lengthened version, the Q class.\n\nIn July 1916 Luftschiffbau Zeppelin introduced the R-class, 199.49&nbsp;m (644&nbsp;ft 8&nbsp;in) long, and with a volume of {{convert|1949600|ft3|m3|order=flip|abbr=on}}. These could carry loads of three to four tons of bombs and reach speeds of up to {{convert|64|mph|kph|order=flip|abbr=on}}, powered by six {{convert|240|hp|kW|abbr=on}} [[Maybach]] engines.<ref>Robinson 1973, pp335\u20136</ref>\n\nIn 1917, following losses to the air defences over Britain, new designs were produced which were capable of flying at much higher altitudes, typically operating at around {{convert|20000|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}}. This was achieved by reducing the weight of the airship by reducing the weight of the structure, halving the bomb load, deleting the defensive armament and by reducing the number of engines to five.<ref>Robinson 1973, pp.127\u20138</ref> However these were not successful as bombers: the greater height at which they operated greatly hindered navigation, and their reduced power made them vulnerable to unfavorable weather conditions.\n\n[[File:IWMzeppelinspybasket.JPG|thumb|right|The [[spy basket|observation car]] preserved at the [[Imperial War Museum]] ]]\n\nAt the beginning of the war Captain [[Ernst A. Lehmann]] and Baron Gemmingen, Count Zeppelin's nephew, developed an [[Spy basket|observation car]] for use by dirigibles.<ref>Robinson 1973, pp. 93-4</ref> This was equipped with a wicker chair, chart table, electric lamp and compass, with telephone line and lightning conductor part of the suspension cable. The car's observer would relay navigation and bomb dropping orders to the Zeppelin flying within or above the clouds, so remaining invisible from the ground.<ref name=Lehmann>[[#Lehmann3|Lehmann, The Zeppelins]]</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|de Syon|2001|p=104.}}</ref> Although used by Army airships, they were not used by the Navy, since Strasser considered that their weight meant an unacceptable reduction in bomb load.<ref>Robinson 1971, pp. 68-9 (fn)</ref>\n\n====End of the war====\nThe German defeat also marked the end of German military dirigibles, as the victorious Allies demanded a complete abolition of German air forces and surrender of the remaining airships as [[war reparations|reparations]]. Specifically, the [[Treaty of Versailles]] contained the following articles dealing explicitly with dirigibles:\n\n;Article 198:\"The armed forces of Germany must not include any military or naval air forces&nbsp;... No dirigible shall be kept.\"\n;Article 202:\"On the coming into force of the present Treaty, all military and naval aeronautical material&nbsp;... must be delivered to the Governments of the Principal Allied and Associated Powers&nbsp;... In particular, this material will include all items under the following heads which are or have been in use or were designed for warlike purposes:\n:''[...]''\n:* \"Dirigibles able to take to the air, being manufactured, repaired or assembled.\"\n:* \"Plant for the manufacture of hydrogen.\"\n:* \"Dirigible sheds and shelters of every kind for aircraft.\"\n:\"Pending their delivery, dirigibles will, at the expense of Germany, be maintained inflated with hydrogen; the plant for the manufacture of hydrogen, as well as the sheds for dirigibles may at the discretion of the said Powers, be left to Germany until the time when the dirigibles are handed over.\"\n\nOn 23 June 1919, a week before the treaty was signed, many Zeppelin crews destroyed their airships in their halls in order to prevent delivery, following the example of the [[Scuttling of the German fleet at Scapa Flow]] two days earlier. The remaining dirigibles were transferred to France, Italy, Britain, and Belgium in 1920.\n\nA total of 84 Zeppelins were built during the war. Over 60 were lost, roughly evenly divided between accident and enemy action. 51 raids had been made on England alone,{{refn|The figures given total 54. While A. Whitehouse in ''The Zeppelin Fighters'' (1966) gives figures of 5,907 bombs dropped, 528 people killed, 1,156 wounded in 208 individual sorties.|group=N}} in which 5,806 bombs were dropped, killing 557 people and injuring 1,358 while causing damage estimated at \u00a31.5 million. It has been argued the raids were effective far beyond material damage in diverting and hampering wartime production: one estimate is that the due to the 1915\u201316 raids \"one sixth of the total normal output of munitions was entirely lost.\"<ref>Liddell Hart 1934, p. 76.</ref>\n\n===After World War I===\n====Renaissance====\n[[File:Airship Bodensee, Oct. 1919.jpg|thumbnail|The ''Bodensee'' 1919]]\n[[File:LZ121 Nordstern.jpg|thumbnail|The ''Nordstern'' 1920]]\nCount von Zeppelin had died in 1917, before the end of the war. Dr. [[Hugo Eckener]], who had long envisioned dirigibles as vessels of peace rather than of war, took command of the Zeppelin business, hoping to quickly resume civilian flights. Despite considerable difficulties, they completed two small passenger airships; [[Zeppelin LZ 120 Bodensee|LZ 120 ''Bodensee'']] {Scrapped July 1928}, which first flew in August 1919 and in the following months transported passengers between Friedrichshafen and Berlin, and a sister-ship ''LZ 121 Nordstern'', {Scrapped September 1926} which was intended for use on a regular route to [[Stockholm]].<ref>Robinson 1973, pp. 257-8</ref>\n\nHowever, in 1921 the Allied Powers demanded that these should be handed over as war reparations as compensation for the dirigibles destroyed by their crews in 1919. Germany was not allowed to construct military aircraft and only airships of less than {{convert|1000000|ft3|m3|order=flip|abbr=on}} were permitted. This brought a halt to Zeppelin's plans for airship development, and the company temporarily had to resort to manufacturing aluminium cooking utensils.<ref>Robinson 1973, p. 259</ref>\n\nEckener and his co-workers refused to give up and kept looking for investors and a way to circumvent Allied restrictions. Their opportunity came in 1924. The United States had started to experiment with rigid airships, constructing one of their own, the [[USS Shenandoah (ZR-1)|ZR-1 USS ''Shenandoah'']], and buying the [[R38 (ZR-2)|R38]] (based on the Zeppelin L&nbsp;70) when the British airship programme was cancelled. However, this broke apart and caught fire during a test flight above the [[Humber]] on 23 August 1921, killing 44 crewmen.<ref>Driggs, Laurence La Tourette.

Germany had to pay for this airship itself, as the cost was set against the war reparation accounts, but for the Zeppelin company this was unimportant. [[USS Los Angeles (ZR-3)|LZ&nbsp;126]] made its first flight on 27 August 1924.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename= U.S. Zeppelin on Trial|section=News in Brief |day_of_week= Friday|date=29 August 1924 |page_number= 9|issue=43743 |column=A }}</ref>\n\nOn 12 October at 07:30 local time the Zeppelin took off for the US under the command of Hugo Eckener.

It operated reliably for eight years until it was retired in 1932 for economic reasons. It was dismantled in August 1940.\n\n====Golden age====\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00834, Friedrichshafen, Luftschiff Graf Zeppelin.jpg|thumbnail|upright|''Graf Zeppelin'' under construction]]\nWith the delivery of ''LZ 126'', the Zeppelin company had reasserted its lead in rigid airship construction, but it was not yet quite back in business. In 1926 restrictions on airship construction were relaxed by the [[Locarno treaties]], but acquiring the necessary funds for the next project proved a problem in the difficult economic situation of post\u2013World War I Germany, and it took Eckener two years of lobbying and publicity work to secure the realization of ''LZ 127''.\n\nAnother two years passed before 18 September 1928, when the new dirigible, christened [[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|''Graf Zeppelin'']] in honour of the Count, flew for the first time.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename= Largest Zeppelin|section=News|day_of_week=  Wednesday|date=19 September 1928 |page_number= 14|issue=45002 |column=F }}</ref> With a total length of {{convert|236.6|m|ft}} and a volume of 105,000 m<sup>3</sup>, it was the largest dirigible to have been built at the time.\nEckener's initial purpose was to use ''Graf Zeppelin'' for experimental and demonstration purposes to prepare the way for regular airship traveling, carrying passengers and mail to cover the costs. In October 1928 its first long-range voyage brought it to Lakehurst, the voyage taking 112 hours and setting a new endurance record for airships.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename= The Zeppelin Flight|section=News|day_of_week= Tuesday|date=16 October 1928 |page_number= 16|issue= 45025 |column=A}}</ref> Eckener and his crew, which included his son Hans, were once more welcomed enthusiastically, with confetti parades in New York and another invitation to the White House. ''Graf Zeppelin'' toured Germany and visited Italy, [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and Spain. A second trip to the United States was aborted in France due to engine failure in May 1929.\n[[File:ZeppelinLZ127a.jpg|thumbnail|left|The ''Graf Zeppelin'']]\nIn August 1929 ''Graf Zeppelin'' departed for another daring enterprise: a [[circumnavigation]] of the globe. The growing popularity of the \"giant of the air\" made it easy for Eckener to find sponsors. One of these was the American press tycoon [[William Randolph Hearst]], who requested that the tour officially start in Lakehurst.<ref>Swinfield 2012, p.237</ref> As with the October 1928 flight to New York, Hearst had placed a reporter, [[Grace Marguerite Hay Drummond-Hay]], on board: she therefore became the first woman to circumnavigate the globe by air. From there, ''Graf Zeppelin'' flew to Friedrichshafen, then Tokyo, Los Angeles, and back to Lakehurst, in 21&nbsp;days 5&nbsp;hours and 31&nbsp;minutes. Including the initial and final trips between Friedrichshafen and Lakehurst and back, the dirigible had travelled {{convert|49618|km|mi}}.\n\n[[File:Graf Zeppelin stamp 65c 1930 issue.jpg|thumb|right|US Air Mail 1930 picturing Graf Zeppelin]]\nIn the following year, ''Graf Zeppelin'' undertook trips around Europe, and following a successful tour to [[Recife]], Brazil in May 1930, it was decided to open the first regular transatlantic airship line. This line operated between [[Frankfurt]] and Recife, and was later extended to [[Rio de Janeiro]], with a stop in Recife. Despite the beginning of the [[Great Depression]] and growing competition from fixed-wing aircraft, ''LZ 127'' transported an increasing volume of passengers and mail across the ocean every year until 1936. The ship made another spectacular voyage in July 1931 when it made a seven-day research trip to the [[Arctic]].<ref>Swinfield 2012, p. 239</ref>{{refn|Koestler was the only journalist on board.

''Arrow in the Blue'' 1952, pp. 275\u2013300.</ref>|group=N}} This had already been a dream of Count von Zeppelin twenty years earlier, which could not be realized at the time due to the outbreak of war.\n\nEckener intended to follow the successful airship with another larger Zeppelin, designated LZ&nbsp;128. This was to be powered by eight engines, {{convert|761|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} in length, with a capacity of {{convert|7062100|ft3|m3|order=flip|abbr=on}}. However the loss of the British passenger airship [[R101]] on 5 October 1930 led the Zeppelin company to reconsider the safety of hydrogen-filled vessels, and the design was abandoned in favour of a new project, LZ&nbsp;129. This was intended to be filled with [[Inert gas|inert]] [[helium]].<ref>Robinson 1973, p. 283</ref>\n\n====Hindenburg, end of an era====\n{{Main|LZ 129 Hindenburg}}\n[[File:Hindenburg at lakehurst.jpg|thumbnail|left|The ''Hindenburg'': note swastikas on tail fins.]]\nThe coming to power of the [[Nazi Party]] in 1933 had important consequences for Zeppelin Luftschiffbau. Zeppelins became a propaganda tool for the new regime: they would now display the Nazi [[swastika]] on their fins and occasionally tour Germany to play march music and propaganda speeches to the people. In 1934 [[Joseph Goebbels]], the Minister of Propaganda, contributed two million reichsmarks towards the construction of LZ&nbsp;129 and in 1935 [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] established a new airline directed by [[Ernst Lehmann]], the ''[[Deutsche Zeppelin Reederei]]'', as a subsidiary of ''[[Lufthansa]]'' to take over Zeppelin operations. Hugo Eckener was an outspoken anti-Nazi: complaints about the use of Zeppelins for propaganda purposes in 1936 led Goebbels to declare \"Dr.&nbsp;Eckener has placed himself outside the pale of society. Henceforth his name is not to be mentioned in the newspapers and his photograph is not to be published\".<ref>Robinson 1973, p.&nbsp;282</ref>\n\nOn 4&nbsp;March 1936 [[LZ 129 Hindenburg|LZ 129 ''Hindenburg'']] (named after former [[President of Germany]], [[Paul von Hindenburg]]) made its first flight. The ''Hindenburg'' was the largest airship ever built. It had been designed to use non-flammable helium, but the only supplies of the gas were controlled by the United States, which refused to allow its export.<ref>Robinson 1973, p.&nbsp;285</ref> So, in what proved to be a fatal decision, the ''Hindenburg'' was filled with flammable [[hydrogen]]. Apart from the propaganda missions, ''LZ&nbsp;129'' was used on the transatlantic service alongside ''Graf Zeppelin''.\n[[File:Hindenburg burning.jpg|thumb|The Hindenburg on fire in 1937]]\nOn 6&nbsp;May 1937, while landing in [[Naval Air Engineering Station Lakehurst|Lakehurst]] after a transatlantic flight, the tail of the ship caught fire, and within seconds, the ''Hindenburg'' burst into flames, killing 35 of the 97&nbsp;people on board and 1&nbsp;member of the ground crew. The cause of the fire has not been definitively determined. The investigation into the accident concluded that [[static electricity]] had ignited hydrogen which had leaked from the gasbags, although there were allegations of [[sabotage]]. 13&nbsp;passengers and 22&nbsp;crew, including Ernst Lehmann, were killed.<ref>Robinson 1973, pp&nbsp;291-294.</ref>\n\nDespite the apparent danger, there remained a list of 400&nbsp;people who still wanted to fly as Zeppelin passengers and had paid for the trip. Their money was refunded in 1940.\n\n''Graf Zeppelin'' was retired one month after the ''Hindenburg'' wreck and turned into a museum.<ref>Robinson 1974, p.&nbsp;294</ref> The intended new flagship Zeppelin was completed in 1938 and, inflated with hydrogen, made some test flights (the first on 14&nbsp;September), but never carried passengers.<ref>Robinson 1974, p.&nbsp;295</ref> Another project, ''LZ&nbsp;131'', designed to be even larger than ''Hindenburg'' and ''Graf Zeppelin&nbsp;II'', never progressed beyond the production of a few ring frames.\n\n''Graf Zeppelin&nbsp;II'' was assigned to the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' and made about 30 test flights prior to the beginning of World War II. Most of those flights were carried out near the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish]] border, first in the [[Sudeten mountains]] region of Silesia, then in the Baltic Sea region. During one such flight ''LZ&nbsp;130'' crossed the Polish border near the [[Hel Peninsula]], where it was intercepted by a Polish [[Lublin R-XIII]] aircraft from [[Puck, Poland|Puck]] naval airbase and forced to leave Polish airspace.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} During this time, ''LZ&nbsp;130'' was used for electronic scouting missions, and was equipped with various measuring equipment. In August 1939, it made a flight near the coastline of Great Britain in an attempt to determine whether the 100&nbsp;metre towers erected from [[Portsmouth]] to [[Scapa Flow]] were used for aircraft radio location.<ref>Robinson 1973, p.&nbsp;295</ref> Photography, radio wave interception, magnetic and radio frequency analysis were unable to detect operational British [[Chain Home]] [[radar]] due to searching in the wrong frequency range. The frequencies searched were too high, an assumption based on the Germans' own radar systems. The mistaken conclusion was that the British towers were not connected with radar operations, but were for naval radio communications.\n\nAfter the beginning of the Second World War on 1&nbsp;September, the ''Luftwaffe'' ordered LZ&nbsp;127 and ''LZ&nbsp;130'' moved to a large Zeppelin hangar in Frankfurt, where the skeleton of LZ&nbsp;131 was also located. In March 1940 G\u00f6ring ordered the scrapping of the remaining airships, and on 6&nbsp;May the Frankfurt hangars were demolished.<ref>Robinson 1973, p.&nbsp;296.</ref>\n\n==Cultural influences==\nZeppelins have been an inspiration to music, cinematography and literature.

A Zeppelin was used in [[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]], when Jones and his father try to escape from Germany in a Zeppelin.\n\nIn 1968, English rock band [[Led Zeppelin]] chose their name after [[Keith Moon]], drummer of [[The Who]], told guitarist [[Jimmy Page]] that his idea to create a band would \"go down like a lead balloon.\" Page's manager [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]] suggested changing the spelling of \"Lead\" to \"Led\" to avoid mispronunciation. \"Balloon\" was replaced with \"Zeppelin\" as Jimmy Page saw it as a symbol of \"the perfect combination of heavy and light, combustibility and grace.\" For the group's [[Led Zeppelin (album)|self-titled debut album]], Page suggested the group use a picture of the Hindenburg crashing in [[New Jersey]] in 1937, much to Frau Eva Von Zeppelin's disgust. Von Zeppelin tried to sue the group for using the name Zeppelin, but the case was eventually dismissed.\n\n==Modern era==\n[[File:Friedrichshafen-0500.jpg|thumb|Zeppelin NT]]\nSince the 1990s [[Zeppelin Luftschifftechnik]], a daughter enterprise of the Zeppelin conglomerate that built the original German Zeppelins, has been developing Zeppelin \"New Technology\" (NT) airships.
