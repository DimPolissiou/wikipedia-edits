He was forced to leave home at the age of 14 to seek employment. He started to write in his spare time, while working at various jobs, which included working in a [[pawn shop]], as a tailor, a policeman and as a postman at one point in his life. He came to be acquainted with author [[Kubota Mantaro]], who encouraged him in his literary efforts.\n\nKawaguchi was arrested in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa]] in 1933, along with fellow literati [[Kume Masao]] and [[Satomi Ton]] for illegal card [[gambling]].\n\nIn 1935, Kawaguchi won the first [[Naoki Prize]] for a [[short story]] titled ''Tsuruhachi Tsurujir\u014d''. He followed this with a serialized [[novel]], ''Aizen Katsura'', a [[melodrama]]tic love story involving a nurse and a doctor, which ran from 1936-1938. The story became a tremendously popular bestseller and gained him considerable fame. It was later made into a movie starring [[Kinuyo Tanaka]] and [[Ken Uehara]], and was the basis of numerous [[television series]].\n\nAfter [[World War II]], Kawaguchi resumed his literary activity, publishing plays and novels. He won the Yoshikawa Eiji Prize for his novel ''Shigurejaya Oriku'', a nostalgic series of episodes involving a prostitute who rose to become a brothel owner.\n\nMany of Kawaguchi's novels were adapted to film, and he was long associated with [[Daiei Motion Picture Company]]. In 1965, he became a member of the Japan Academy of the Arts. He was awarded the [[Order of Culture]] by the Japanese government in 1973. His wife was the movie actress [[Aiko Mimasu]], and his son was actor [[Hiroshi Kawaguchi]].\n\nKawaguchi won the [[Yoshikawa Eiji Prize]] for his novel ''Shigurejaya Oriku'', a nostalgic series of episodes involving a farm girl, sold to a brothel, who rose to become owner of a famous Tokyo teahouse. The story was eventually translated into English by Royall Tyler.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Japanese literature]]\n*[[List of Japanese authors]]\n\n==References==\n* Kawaguchi, Matsutar\u014d.
