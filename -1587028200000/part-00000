This long period of dominance of the H\u00f8jre party under the leadership of [[Jacob Br\u00f8nnum Scavenius Estrup]] with the backing of the king [[Christian IX of Denmark]] was named the ''provisorietid'' (provisional period) because the government was based on provisional laws instead of parliamentary decisions. This also gave rise to a conflict with the Liberals (farm owners) at that time and now known as [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]] (Left). This constitutional battle concluded in 1901 with the so-called systemskifte (change of system) with the liberals as victors. At this point the king and H\u00f8jre finally accepted [[parliamentarism]] as the ruling principle of Danish political life. This principle was not [[Codification (law)|codified]] until the 1953 constitution.\n\n=== Universal suffrage (1915) ===\nIn 1915, the tightening from 1866 was reversed, and women were given the right to vote. Also, a new requirement for changing the constitution was introduced. Not only must the new constitution be passed by two consecutive parliaments, it must also pass a referendum, where 45% of the electorate must vote yes. This meant that Prime Minister [[Thorvald Stauning]]'s attempt to change the Constitution in 1939 failed.<ref>S\u00f8ren M\u00f8rch: ''24 statsministre''. {{ISBN|87-02-00361-9}}.</ref>\n\n=== Reunion with Schleswig (1920) ===\n{{See also|1920 Schleswig plebiscites}}\nIn 1920, a [[1920 Danish constitutional referendum|new referendum]] was held to change the Constitution again, allowing for the reunification of Denmark following the defeat of Germany in [[World War I]]. This followed a [[referendum]] held in the former Danish territories of Schleswig-Holstein regarding how the new border should be placed. This resulted in upper Schleswig becoming Danish, today known as [[Southern Jutland]], and the rest remained German.\n\n=== Current Constitution (1953) ===\nIn 1953, the [[1953 Danish constitutional and electoral age referendum|fourth constitution]] abolished the Upper Chamber (the [[Landsting (Denmark)|Landsting]]), giving Denmark a [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] parliament. It also enabled females to inherit the throne (see ''[[Danish monarchy#Succession|Succession]]''), but the change still favored boys over girls (this was changed by a [[2009 Danish Act of Succession referendum|referendum in 2009]] so the first-born inherits the throne regardless of sex). Finally, the required number of votes in favor of a change of the Constitution was decreased to the current value of 40% of the electorate.\n\nIn 2009, the [[Danish Act of Succession|Act of Succession]], which is referenced in the constitution and considered an integral part of it, was changed to  eliminate [[male-preference primogeniture]] in favour of [[absolute primogeniture]].

The throne is inherited according to the [[Danish Act of Succession|Act of Succession]], which itself has the same status as the constitution. The [[Church of Denmark]] is the state church. The constitution holds for the entire [[The unity of the Realm|Danish realm]].\n|-\n|2\n|The royal family\n|\u00a7\u00a7 5\u201311\n|There are a number of requirements that the [[Monarchy of Denmark|sovereign]] must live up to, most importantly they must belong to the [[evangelical Lutheran]] faith; in practice they have always have been members of the Church of Denmark. The [[age of majority]] for the sovereign is at 18 years, and the Folketing can make provisions if the sovereign in incapable, minor or abroad, and choose a new sovereign if there are no heirs to the throne. Royal expenses are financed through [[Annuity|annuities]] granted by the Folketing.\n|-\n|3\n|The government\n|\u00a7\u00a7 12\u201327\n|The sovereign,{{Efn|The constitution refers to the sovereign as the \"King\", even though it is currently [[Margrethe II of Denmark|a queen]]. As the queen executes her powers through the government, the use of \"King\" nearly always means the government.|name=|group=lower-alpha}} who formally holds executive power, always exercises this power through the ministers in the government, making the role of sovereign fully ceremonial. The Kingdom employs the principle of negative [[Parliamentary system|parliamentarianism]], namely that no minister can remain in their post, if a majority of the Folketing opposes them. In addition ministers can be trialed at the Court of [[Impeachment]] (\u00a7\u00a7 59-60) for their actions while in government. Government business are discussed in the Council of State or the Council of Ministers, who today have little importance. New laws must receive [[royal assent]] and be proclaimed; this happens in ''[[Lovtidende]]''. Pre-constitutional laws remain in effect.\n\nMinisters have the right to propose laws and decision (in case they are not members of the Folketing), and the government is allowed to pardon criminals and mint coins. Under exceptional circumstances, the government can enact temporary laws, which must be reaffirmed by the Folketing as quickly as possible. In foreign policy, important decisions are taken by the Foreign Policy Committee in the Folketing, including the ratification of treaties, and the initiation of offensive military operations. A certain type of civil servants, known in Danish as ''tjenestem\u00e6nd'' (lit. servicemen), have special privileges to prevent corruption.\n\n\u00a7 20 allows the State of Denmark to hand over [[sovereignty]] to [[intergovernmental organization]]s, which is often a requirement for joining them. This needs a [[supermajority]] of 5/6 in the Folketing, or that it is approved in a referendum.\n|-\n|4\n|Elections to the Folketing\n|\u00a7\u00a7 28\u201334\n|The Folketing consists of up to 179 members,{{Efn|The constitution says \"not more than\" 179, but the Danish election law says that exactly 179 members are elected.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=206576|title=LBK nr 137 af 07/02/2019|last=|first=|date=21 February 2019|website=Retsinformation|language=da|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=24 November 2019}}</ref>|name=|group=}} of which two are elected from [[Greenland]], and two from the [[Faroe Islands]]. Elections are held at least every 4 years, with the [[Prime Minister of Denmark|Prime Minister]] able to call a [[snap election]]. Elections are direct and secret, and the voting system shall ensure [[proportional representation]]. To vote you need to be a Danish citizen not under [[legal guardian]]ship, live in Denmark, and be above the voting age. The voting age was set to 23 years in a [[1953 Danish constitutional and electoral age referendum|1953 referendum]], but has since been lowered three times, and has been 18 years since 1978. Changes to the voting age require a referendum. All eligible to vote are eligible to run for a seat in the Folketing; however the Folketing can expel members who have been convicted of a crime, if they deem that they are \"unworthy\" of their seat. Acts against the security or freedom of the Folketing is high treason.\n|-\n|5\n|The Folketing\n|\u00a7\u00a7 35\u201358\n|The business year runs from the first Tuesday in October to the first Tuesday in October the next year. After a general election and at the beginning of a new business year, all unfinished business is dropped, and the Folketing starts anew. The Folketing elects a [[Speaker of the Folketing|speaker]] and vice chairmen, both after an election and at the beginning of each business year. A business year starts with an opening speech from the prime minister.\nThe Folketing meets where the government resides, which is in [[Christiansborg Palace]]. The speaker calls the meetings, and are obliged to do so on request from the prime minister or two-fifths of the Folketing. Meetings are public accessible; closed meetings can be held, but the last time this happened was in 1924, during a [[Erik the Red's Land|conflict with Norway over Greenland]]. A [[quorum]] consists of half of the members. Every member of the Folketing can propose laws and decisions, and only they (and ministers per \u00a7 21) can do that. All bills require three [[Reading (legislature)|readings]] before being passed into law. One-third of the Folketing can demand that an otherwise passed bill should be confirmed in a referendum, though some bills, among those fiscal bills, cannot be subject of a referendum.\n\nEach year, a finance bill, which defines the state budget, needs to be passed into law for the following fiscal year (which since 1979 has followed the calendar year). A provisional appropriations bill can be passed if the finance bill is not passed in time. A budget or a supplementary appropriation act is necessary to charge taxes and spend money, though in practice the Finance Committee have been allowed to approve extra expenditures, which are then spent before being passed into law. The public accounts shall be ready six months after the fiscal year, and are audited by the State Auditors, who are appointed by the Folketing.\n\nMembers of the Folketing receive a salary, and have absolute [[freedom of speech]] within the Folketing. In addition, they have [[parliamentary immunity]], except if caught in the act, though this immunity can be lifted by the Folketing. Members are not in any way bound by pledges or what [[Party discipline|their party says]], but free to vote in any way they wish. They can ask ministers questions, who are then obliged to answer.\n\nAppointments to parliamentary committees are done through proportional representation. The Folketing appoint one or two [[ombudsman|ombudsmen]]; the Folketing have decided to only appoint one. The Folketing can establish parliamentary commissions for investigations, though this have only happened five times; usually commissions led by a judge is used instead. All taxes, state loans, and military inscriptions must be set in laws. Foreigners can only be [[Danish nationality law|naturalized by law]], and only buy real-estate as permitted by law.\n|-\n|6\n|The courts\n|\u00a7\u00a7 59\u201365\n|The courts are independent of the government, though they are regulated by law. Establishing a new court to handle a specific case is not allowed. Judges answers to no-one, and in general cannot be fired or forcefully moved to a new position, unless due to a restructuring, or by verdict from other judges. Judges above 65 years can be fired, but will receive full pay until the mandatory retirement age, which is currently 70 years. It is possible to sue public agencies. The Folketing can establish special courts to handle such cases, and their verdicts can be appealed to the [[Supreme Court (Denmark)|Supreme Court]], though none have been established. Court proceedings must be as transparent as possible, and [[lay judge]]s must be used in criminal cases.\nThe special Court of Impeachment, which decides cases against ministers, consists of the 15 most senior Supreme Court judges and an equal amount appointed by the Folketing. The appointed judges cannot be members of the Folketing themselves, and sits for 6 years but remain on cases started before the end of their term. Cases are brought before the impeachment court by the government or the Folketing. Only five impeachment cases have been held; the latest was the 1993\u20131995 case against former [[Justice Minister (Denmark)|Minister of Justice]], [[Erik Ninn-Hansen]] regarding the [[Tamil Case (Denmark)|Tamil Case]].\n|-\n|7\n|Religion\n|\u00a7\u00a7 66\u201370\n|The Church of Denmark is the state church by \u00a7 4, and the Folketing can by statue decide its constitution, but has not done so. Denmark has [[freedom of religion]], and allows all to form and join religious communities, as long as they do not impinge on \"good morals or public order\". No-one is forced to pay to religions that are not their own, so the church tax is only paid by members of the Church of Denmark.

[[General election]]s is nominally held every 4 years, but the Prime Minister can at any point call a snap election. All Danish citizens over the age of 18 years who are living permanently within Denmark is eligible to vote, except those placed under [[legal guardianship]]. The same group of people is able to run for office. The electoral system is characterized as a [[party-list proportional representation]] system, with an [[election threshold]] on 2%. As a result, Denmark has a [[Multi-party system|multi-party parliamentary system]], where no single party has an absolute majority.\n\nThe session starts anew each year on the first Tuesday in October, and when interrupted by a general election; all previously unfinished business is cancelled. The Folketing then elects a [[Speaker of the Folketing|speaker]], who is responsible for convening meetings. The Folketing lay down their own [[Parliamentary procedure|rules of procedure]], subject to the requirements in the Constitution. Among those, the required [[quorum]] of 90 members of the Folketing, and the rule that every [[Bill (law)|proposed law]] requires three [[Reading (legislature)|readings]] in the Folketing, before it can be passed into law.\n\nThe Folketing also have the responsibility of holding the government accountable for the governance. The members of the Folketing does this by submitting questing to the ministers and convene them to explanatory hearings. In addition, the Folketing elect a number of ''State Auditors'' ({{Lang-da|Statsrevisorer}}), who has the responsibility to look through the public accounts, and check that everything is okay, and that the government only spend money approved by the Folketing. Furthermore, the Folketing also appoints an [[ombudsman]], who investigates wrongdoings by the public administrative authorities on behalf of the public.\n\n=== The courts ===\n{{Main|Courts of Denmark}}\nThe [[Courts of Denmark]] are independent of the other two branches. The Constitution does not stipulate how the courts are to be organized. Instead, this is regulated by statute. In the normal court system, there are 24 District Courts, High Courts and the [[Supreme Court (Denmark)|Supreme Court]]. In addition to these, there is some special courts. There are certain rights in the Constitution with respect to the judiciary system.\n\nThere is a special Court of Impeachment, which can prosecute ministers for their official acts.\n\nThe court system is [[Judicial review in Denmark|able to perform judicial review]] of laws, i.e. check [[Judicial review|if they are constitutional]]. This right is not included in the constitution, but was established by the Supreme Court in the beginning of the 20'th century, when it decided to hear cases about the constitutionally of land laws. While this right was contested in the beginning, the political system eventually accepted it. The Supreme Court have been reluctant to rules laws unconstitutional; the only time it have done so was in 1999, when it found that the [[Tvind]] law breached the principle of separations of power. Cases about the constitutionality of laws can only be initiated by people directly affected by the laws. All can do this with respect to the Danish relation to EU, because of its wide effects on society.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://jyllands-posten.dk/debat/kronik/article5217123.ece/|title=Domstolene som grundlovens vogter|last=Christensen|first=Jens Peter|date=23 February 2013|work=Jyllands-Posten|access-date=26 November 2019|language=da|author-link=Jens Peter Christensen}}</ref>\n\n=== The Church of Denmark ===\n{{Main|Church of Denmark}}\nThe Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Denmark is the [[State religion|state church]] established by the Constitution.

The [[Supreme Court of Denmark|Supreme Court]] acquitted Rasmussen (and thereby earlier governments dating back to 1972) but reaffirmed that there are limits to how much sovereignty can be surrendered. In 2011, Prime Ministers [[Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen]] faced a similar challenge when he was sued by twenty-eight citizens for having adopted the European [[Lisbon Treaty]] without a referendum. The group of professors, actors, writers and Eurosceptic politicians argued that the Lisbon Treaty hands over parts of national sovereignty to the EU and therefore a referendum should have taken place.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Pop|first1=Valentina|title=Danish PM sued over Lisbon Treaty|url=https://euobserver.com/political/31622|accessdate=14 April 2016|publisher=[[EUobserver]]|date=11 January 2011|location=Brussels}}</ref> The case was later dismissed.\n\nSection 20 was used in 1972 when Denmark, after a [[1972 Danish European Communities membership referendum|referendum]], joined the [[European Economic Community|EEC]] (now [[European Union|EU]]).

However, the division between legislative and executive power in Denmark is not as sharp as in the [[United States]].\n\nIn 1999, the Supreme Court found that the [[Tvind]] law, a law that barred specific schools from receiving public funding, was unconstitutional, because it breached the concept of separation of powers by settling a concrete dispute between the Tvind schools and the government.

Section 15 in the Act, which deals with\nthe parliamentary principle, lays down that \"a Minister shall not remain in office after the Parliament has passed a vote of no confidence in him\".<ref name=\"Act\" /> This suggests that Ministers are accountable to Parliament and even subservient to it. The Cabinet exerts executive power through its Ministers, but cannot remain in office if the majority of the Folketing goes against it. Another important feature of the Danish parliamentary system is that the Constitutional Act lays down that \"the Members of the Folketing shall be elected for a period of four years\", but still, \"the King may at any time issue writs for a new election\".<ref name=\"danishparliament\" />\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Politics|Denmark|Faroe Islands}}\n*[[Codified constitution]]\n*[[Constitutional economics]]\n*[[Constitutionalism]]\n*[[Constitutional law]]\n*[[Index of Denmark-related articles]]\n*[[Politics of Denmark]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikisourcepar|Constitutional Act of Denmark, 5 June 1953}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121120170200/http://www.thedanishparliament.dk/Democracy/The_Constitutional_Act_of_Denmark.aspx The Constitutional Act of Denmark] - The Danish Parliament\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140714134738/http://pub.uvm.dk/2008/democracycanon/kap20.html The Constitutional Act of the Kingdom of Denmark] - Ministry of Education of Denmark\n\n{{Constitution of Europe}}\n{{Denmark topics}}\n{{Faroe Islands topics}}\n{{Greenland topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Constitution Of Denmark}}\n[[Category:1849 in law]]\n[[Category:Government of Denmark]]\n[[Category:Legal history of Denmark]]\n[[Category:Politics of Denmark]]\n[[Category:History of the Faroe Islands]]\n[[Category:Politics of the Faroe Islands]]\n[[Category:History of Greenland]]\n[[Category:Politics of Greenland]]\n[[Category:Danish law| ]]\n[[Category:1849 in Denmark]]\n[[Category:Constitution of Denmark]]\n[[Category:Politics of the Kingdom of Denmark]]\n[[Category:June 1849 events]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox constitution\n| document_name        = Constitutional Act of the Kingdom of Denmark\n| image                = Grundloven-1849-forside.jpg\n| image_alt            =\n| caption              = Front page of the first constitution from 1849\n| orig_lang_code       = da\n| title_orig           = Danmarks Riges Grundlov\n| jurisdiction         = [[Denmark]], [[Greenland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]\n| date_ratified        = 25 May 1849 (first)<br />[[1953 Danish constitutional and electoral age referendum|28 May 1953]] (current)\n| date_effective       = [[Constitution Day (Denmark)|5 June]] 1849 (first)<br /> 5 June 1953 (current)\n| system               = [[Constitutional monarchy]]\n| branches             = Three (executive, legislature and judiciary)\n| chambers             = Unicameral ([[Folketing]])\n| executive            = [[Cabinet of Denmark|Cabinet]] responsible to parliament\n| courts               = [[Supreme Court (Denmark)|Supreme Court]] and others\n| location_of_document =\n| writer               = Constitutional Assembly of the Realm\n| signers              = [[Frederick VII of Denmark|Frederick VII]] (first)<br />[[Frederick IX of Denmark|Frederick IX]] (current)\n| media_type           =\n}}\n{{Politics of Denmark}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2012}}\n\nThe '''Constitutional Act of the Kingdom of Denmark''' ({{lang-da|Danmarks Riges Grundlov}}), or simply '''the Constitution''' ({{lang-da|Grundloven}}), is the [[constitution]] of the [[Denmark|Kingdom of Denmark]], applying equally in Denmark proper, [[Greenland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]].

This long period of dominance of the H\u00f8jre party under the leadership of [[Jacob Br\u00f8nnum Scavenius Estrup]] with the backing of the king [[Christian IX of Denmark]] was named the ''provisorietid'' (provisional period) because the government was based on provisional laws instead of parliamentary decisions. This also gave rise to a conflict with the Liberals (farm owners) at that time and now known as [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]] (Left). This constitutional battle concluded in 1901 with the so-called systemskifte (change of system) with the liberals as victors. At this point the king and H\u00f8jre finally accepted [[parliamentarism]] as the ruling principle of Danish political life. This principle was not [[Codification (law)|codified]] until the 1953 constitution.\n\n=== Universal suffrage (1915) ===\nIn 1915, the tightening from 1866 was reversed, and women were given the right to vote. Also, a new requirement for changing the constitution was introduced. Not only must the new constitution be passed by two consecutive parliaments, it must also pass a referendum, where 45% of the electorate must vote yes. This meant that Prime Minister [[Thorvald Stauning]]'s attempt to change the Constitution in 1939 failed.<ref>S\u00f8ren M\u00f8rch: ''24 statsministre''. {{ISBN|87-02-00361-9}}.</ref>\n\n=== Reunion with Schleswig (1920) ===\n{{See also|1920 Schleswig plebiscites}}\nIn 1920, a [[1920 Danish constitutional referendum|new referendum]] was held to change the Constitution again, allowing for the reunification of Denmark following the defeat of Germany in [[World War I]]. This followed a [[referendum]] held in the former Danish territories of Schleswig-Holstein regarding how the new border should be placed. This resulted in upper Schleswig becoming Danish, today known as [[Southern Jutland]], and the rest remained German.\n\n=== Current Constitution (1953) ===\nIn 1953, the [[1953 Danish constitutional and electoral age referendum|fourth constitution]] abolished the Upper Chamber (the [[Landsting (Denmark)|Landsting]]), giving Denmark a [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] parliament. It also enabled females to inherit the throne (see ''[[Danish monarchy#Succession|Succession]]''), but the change still favored boys over girls (this was changed by a [[2009 Danish Act of Succession referendum|referendum in 2009]] so the first-born inherits the throne regardless of sex). Finally, the required number of votes in favor of a change of the Constitution was decreased to the current value of 40% of the electorate.\n\nIn 2009, the [[Danish Act of Succession|Act of Succession]], which is referenced in the constitution and considered an integral part of it, was changed to  eliminate [[male-preference primogeniture]] in favour of [[absolute primogeniture]].

The throne is inherited according to the [[Danish Act of Succession|Act of Succession]], which itself has the same status as the constitution. The [[Church of Denmark]] is the state church. The constitution holds for the entire [[The unity of the Realm|Danish realm]].\n|-\n|2\n|The royal family\n|\u00a7\u00a7 5\u201311\n|There are a number of requirements that the [[Monarchy of Denmark|sovereign]] must live up to, most importantly they must belong to the [[evangelical Lutheran]] faith; in practice they have always have been members of the Church of Denmark. The [[age of majority]] for the sovereign is at 18 years, and the Folketing can make provisions if the sovereign in incapable, minor or abroad, and choose a new sovereign if there are no heirs to the throne. Royal expenses are financed through [[Annuity|annuities]] granted by the Folketing.\n|-\n|3\n|The government\n|\u00a7\u00a7 12\u201327\n|The sovereign,{{Efn|The constitution refers to the sovereign as the \"King\", even though it is currently [[Margrethe II of Denmark|a queen]]. As the queen executes her powers through the government, the use of \"King\" nearly always means the government.|name=|group=lower-alpha}} who formally holds executive power, always exercises this power through the ministers in the government, making the role of sovereign fully ceremonial. Denmark employs the principle of negative [[Parliamentary system|parliamentarianism]], namely that no minister can remain in their post, if a majority of the Folketing opposes them. In addition ministers can be trialed at the Court of [[Impeachment]] (\u00a7\u00a7 59-60) for their actions while in government. Government business are discussed in the Council of State or the Council of Ministers, who today have little importance. New laws must receive [[royal assent]] and be proclaimed; this happens in ''[[Lovtidende]]''. Pre-constitutional laws remain in effect.\n\nMinisters have the right to propose laws and decision (in case they are not members of the Folketing), and the government is allowed to pardon criminals and mint coins. Under exceptional circumstances, the government can enact temporary laws, which must be reaffirmed by the Folketing as quickly as possible. In foreign policy, important decisions are taken by the Foreign Policy Committee in the Folketing, including the ratification of treaties, and the initiation of offensive military operations. A certain type of civil servants, known in Danish as ''tjenestem\u00e6nd'' (lit. servicemen), have special privileges to prevent corruption.\n\n\u00a7 20 allows Denmark to hand over [[sovereignty]] to [[intergovernmental organization]]s, which is often a requirement for joining them. This needs a [[supermajority]] of 5/6 in the Folketing, or that it is approved in a referendum.\n|-\n|4\n|Elections to the Folketing\n|\u00a7\u00a7 28\u201334\n|The Folketing consists of up to 179 members,{{Efn|The constitution says \"not more than\" 179, but the Danish election law says that exactly 179 members are elected.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=206576|title=LBK nr 137 af 07/02/2019|last=|first=|date=21 February 2019|website=Retsinformation|language=da|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=24 November 2019}}</ref>|name=|group=}} of which two are elected from [[Greenland]], and two from the [[Faroe Islands]]. Elections are held at least every 4 years, with the [[Prime Minister of Denmark|Prime Minister]] able to call a [[snap election]]. Elections are direct and secret, and the voting system shall ensure [[proportional representation]]. To vote you need to be a Danish citizen not under [[legal guardian]]ship, live in Denmark, and be above the voting age. The voting age was set to 23 years in a [[1953 Danish constitutional and electoral age referendum|1953 referendum]], but has since been lowered three times, and has been 18 years since 1978. Changes to the voting age require a referendum. All eligible to vote are eligible to run for a seat in the Folketing; however the Folketing can expel members who have been convicted of a crime, if they deem that they are \"unworthy\" of their seat. Acts against the security or freedom of the Folketing is high treason.\n|-\n|5\n|The Folketing\n|\u00a7\u00a7 35\u201358\n|The business year runs from the first Tuesday in October to the first Tuesday in October the next year. After a general election and at the beginning of a new business year, all unfinished business is dropped, and the Folketing starts anew. The Folketing elects a [[Speaker of the Folketing|speaker]] and vice chairmen, both after an election and at the beginning of each business year. A business year starts with an opening speech from the prime minister.\nThe Folketing meets where the government resides, which is in [[Christiansborg Palace]]. The speaker calls the meetings, and are obliged to do so on request from the prime minister or two-fifths of the Folketing. Meetings are public accessible; closed meetings can be held, but the last time this happened was in 1924, during a [[Erik the Red's Land|conflict with Norway over Greenland]]. A [[quorum]] consists of half of the members. Every member of the Folketing can propose laws and decisions, and only they (and ministers per \u00a7 21) can do that. All bills require three [[Reading (legislature)|readings]] before being passed into law. One-third of the Folketing can demand that an otherwise passed bill should be confirmed in a referendum, though some bills, among those fiscal bills, cannot be subject of a referendum.\n\nEach year, a finance bill, which defines the state budget, needs to be passed into law for the following fiscal year (which since 1979 has followed the calendar year). A provisional appropriations bill can be passed if the finance bill is not passed in time. A budget or a supplementary appropriation act is necessary to charge taxes and spend money, though in practice the Finance Committee have been allowed to approve extra expenditures, which are then spent before being passed into law. The public accounts shall be ready six months after the fiscal year, and are audited by the State Auditors, who are appointed by the Folketing.\n\nMembers of the Folketing receive a salary, and have absolute [[freedom of speech]] within the Folketing. In addition, they have [[parliamentary immunity]], except if caught in the act, though this immunity can be lifted by the Folketing. Members are not in any way bound by pledges or what [[Party discipline|their party says]], but free to vote in any way they wish. They can ask ministers questions, who are then obliged to answer.\n\nAppointments to parliamentary committees are done through proportional representation. The Folketing appoint one or two [[ombudsman|ombudsmen]]; the Folketing have decided to only appoint one. The Folketing can establish parliamentary commissions for investigations, though this have only happened five times; usually commissions led by a judge is used instead. All taxes, state loans, and military inscriptions must be set in laws.

Establishing a new court to handle a specific case is not allowed. Judges answers to no-one, and in general cannot be fired or forcefully moved to a new position, unless due to a restructuring, or by verdict from other judges. Judges above 65 years can be fired, but will receive full pay until the mandatory retirement age, which is currently 70 years. It is possible to sue public agencies. The Folketing can establish special courts to handle such cases, and their verdicts can be appealed to the [[Supreme Court (Denmark)|Supreme Court]], though none have been established. Court proceedings must be as transparent as possible, and [[lay judge]]s must be used in criminal cases.\nThe special Court of Impeachment, which decides cases against ministers, consists of the 15 most senior Supreme Court judges and an equal amount appointed by the Folketing. The appointed judges cannot be members of the Folketing themselves, and sits for 6 years but remain on cases started before the end of their term. Cases are brought before the impeachment court by the government or the Folketing. Only five impeachment cases have been held; the latest was the 1993\u20131995 case against former [[Justice Minister (Denmark)|Minister of Justice]], [[Erik Ninn-Hansen]] regarding the [[Tamil Case (Denmark)|Tamil Case]].\n|-\n|7\n|Religion\n|\u00a7\u00a7 66\u201370\n|The Church of Denmark is the state church by \u00a7 4, and the Folketing can by statue decide its constitution, but has not done so. Denmark has [[freedom of religion]], and allows all to form and join religious communities, as long as they do not impinge on \"good morals or public order\". No-one is forced to pay to religions that are not their own, so the church tax is only paid by members of the Church of Denmark.

Special rules can apply in Greenland. Detention outside the criminal system or the immigration system, say due to [[Psychiatry|mental illness]], can be brought before the courts.\nA [[search warrant]] is needed to enter private property, confiscate things, or break the [[secrecy of correspondence]], though general exemptions can be made by law. [[Eminent domain|Expropriations]] must be for the public good, with full compensation, and as allowed by law.

[[Censorship]] is forbidden. All citizens have [[freedom of association]], but associations who use violence or other illegal means can be temporary banned by the government, while dissolution is tested in court. Dissolution of political association can always be appealed to the Supreme Court. Citizens have [[freedom of assembly]] when unarmed, though danger to public order can lead to outdoor assemblies being banned. In case of riots, the police can dissolve assemblies when it \"in the name of the King and the law\" have requested it three times. Freedom from detention, freedom of association and freedom of assembly can be restricted for military personnel.\n\nAll children have the right to free [[State school|public education]], though no duty to use it; [[Homeschooling|home schooling]] and [[private school]]s are allowed.

The background for this transitional provision is that Iceland became independent from Denmark in 1918, but, as [[Kingdom of Iceland]], remained in a [[personal union]] until 1944, when it [[1944 Icelandic constitutional referendum|became a republic]]. The 1918 [[Danish\u2013Icelandic Act of Union]] granted Icelandic citizens the same rights in Denmark as Danish citizens, and after the union was dissolved in 1944, these rights were limited to Icelandic citizens then living in Denmark.\n|-\n|10\n|Changes to the constitution\n|\u00a7 88\n|All changes to the constitution requires a majority in the Folketing twice; both before and after a general election.

[[General election]]s is nominally held every 4 years, but the Prime Minister can at any point call a snap election. All Danish citizens over the age of 18 years who are living permanently within Denmark is eligible to vote, except those placed under [[legal guardianship]]. The same group of people is able to run for office. The electoral system is characterized as a [[party-list proportional representation]] system, with an [[election threshold]] on 2%. As a result, Denmark has a [[Multi-party system|multi-party parliamentary system]], where no single party has an absolute majority.\n\nThe session starts anew each year on the first Tuesday in October, and when interrupted by a general election; all previously unfinished business is cancelled. The Folketing then elects a [[Speaker of the Folketing|speaker]], who is responsible for convening meetings. The Folketing lay down their own [[Parliamentary procedure|rules of procedure]], subject to the requirements in the Constitution. Among those, the required [[quorum]] of 90 members of the Folketing, and the rule that every [[Bill (law)|proposed law]] requires three [[Reading (legislature)|readings]] in the Folketing, before it can be passed into law.\n\nThe Folketing also have the responsibility of holding the government accountable for the governance. The members of the Folketing does this by submitting questing to the ministers and convene them to explanatory hearings. In addition, the Folketing elect a number of ''State Auditors'' ({{Lang-da|Statsrevisorer}}), who has the responsibility to look through the public accounts, and check that everything is okay, and that the government only spend money approved by the Folketing. Furthermore, the Folketing also appoints an [[ombudsman]], who investigates wrongdoings by the public administrative authorities on behalf of the public.\n\n=== The courts ===\n{{Main|Courts of Denmark}}\nThe [[Courts of Denmark]] are independent of the other two branches. The Constitution does not stipulate how the courts are to be organized. Instead, this is regulated by statute. In the normal court system, there are 24 District Courts, High Courts and the [[Supreme Court (Denmark)|Supreme Court]]. In addition to these, there is some special courts. There are certain rights in the Constitution with respect to the judiciary system.\n\nThere is a special Court of Impeachment, which can prosecute ministers for their official acts.\n\nThe court system is [[Judicial review in Denmark|able to perform judicial review]] of laws, i.e. check [[Judicial review|if they are constitutional]]. This right is not included in the constitution, but was established by the Supreme Court in the beginning of the 20'th century, when it decided to hear cases about the constitutionally of land laws. While this right was contested in the beginning, the political system eventually accepted it. The Supreme Court have been reluctant to rules laws unconstitutional; the only time it have done so was in 1999, when it found that the [[Tvind]] law breached the principle of separations of power. Cases about the constitutionality of laws can only be initiated by people directly affected by the laws. All can do this with respect to the Danish relation to EU, because of its wide effects on society.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://jyllands-posten.dk/debat/kronik/article5217123.ece/|title=Domstolene som grundlovens vogter|last=Christensen|first=Jens Peter|date=23 February 2013|work=Jyllands-Posten|access-date=26 November 2019|language=da|author-link=Jens Peter Christensen}}</ref>\n\n=== The Church of Denmark ===\n{{Main|Church of Denmark}}\nThe Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Denmark is the [[State religion|state church]] established by the Constitution.

However, the division between legislative and executive power in Denmark is not as sharp as in the [[United States]].\n\nIn 1999, the Supreme Court found that the [[Tvind]] law, a law that barred specific schools from receiving public funding, was unconstitutional, because it breached the concept of separation of powers by settling a concrete dispute between the Tvind schools and the government. The judgment is the only time the courts have found a law to be unconstitutional.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/indland/historisk-tvind-dom|title=Historisk Tvind-dom|last=|first=|date=19 February 1999|work=DR|access-date=26 November 2019|language=da}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://denstoredanske.dk/Samfund,_jura_og_politik/Jura/Enkelte_navngivne_retssager/Tvind-dommen|title=Tvind-dommen|last=L.|first=Mads|date=|website=Den Store Danske|language=da|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=26 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Parliamentary power===\nIn several sections the Constitutional Act sets out the powers and duties of the Danish Parliament. Section 15 in the Act, which deals with\nthe parliamentary principle, lays down that \"a Minister shall not remain in office after the Parliament has passed a vote of no confidence in him\".<ref name=\"Act\" /> This suggests that Ministers are accountable to Parliament and even subservient to it. The Cabinet exerts executive power through its Ministers, but cannot remain in office if the majority of the Folketing goes against it. Another important feature of the Danish parliamentary system is that the Constitutional Act lays down that \"the Members of the Folketing shall be elected for a period of four years\", but still, \"the King may at any time issue writs for a new election\".<ref name=\"danishparliament\" />\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Politics|Denmark|Faroe Islands}}\n*[[Codified constitution]]\n*[[Constitutional economics]]\n*[[Constitutionalism]]\n*[[Constitutional law]]\n*[[Index of Denmark-related articles]]\n*[[Politics of Denmark]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikisourcepar|Constitutional Act of Denmark, 5 June 1953}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121120170200/http://www.thedanishparliament.dk/Democracy/The_Constitutional_Act_of_Denmark.aspx The Constitutional Act of Denmark] - The Danish Parliament\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140714134738/http://pub.uvm.dk/2008/democracycanon/kap20.html The Constitutional Act of the Kingdom of Denmark] - Ministry of Education of Denmark\n\n{{Constitution of Europe}}\n{{Denmark topics}}\n{{Faroe Islands topics}}\n{{Greenland topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Constitution Of Denmark}}\n[[Category:1849 in law]]\n[[Category:Government of Denmark]]\n[[Category:Legal history of Denmark]]\n[[Category:Politics of Denmark]]\n[[Category:History of the Faroe Islands]]\n[[Category:Politics of the Faroe Islands]]\n[[Category:History of Greenland]]\n[[Category:Politics of Greenland]]\n[[Category:Danish law| ]]\n[[Category:1849 in Denmark]]\n[[Category:Constitution of Denmark]]\n[[Category:Politics of the Kingdom of Denmark]]\n[[Category:June 1849 events]]\n", "name_user": "BALMAINM", "label": "safe", "comment": "dK kingdom", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_Kingdom_of_Denmark"}

With names such as [[Steen1]] and Panama Rayo, he became famous for having remarkably darker, harder and more serious punk influenced lyrical tone compared to other Finnish rappers, who were famous for their relatively light-minded, punchline-centric lyrics. In the early 2000s, his music and public image were widely associated with [[anarchism]] and proletarian activism and he made a name for himself by performing in illegal parties, political protests and even riots.\n\n==Career==\nJulma-Henri began his career at Forever, a rap band he formed in Oulu in 1998 under the pseudonym Money. The band released the single \"Mobmusic\", a demo EP in 2000. The other members were OeO, Reksa ja Leijona. As Money, he released ''Soundtrack 2 My Life'', a self-financed and independently released album produced by RK-62 and Panama Rayo. In 2003, cooperated with Asa and [[Steen1]]. A number of collaborations followed and he appeared in mixtapes and compilations with notable tracks like \"Mit\u00e4 s\u00e4 tied\u00e4t\" and \"Vaan sil on v\u00e4li\u00e4\". In 2004, he worked on ''Soundtrack 2 My Life'' as a full album with appearances by Steen1, Tasis, Travis Bicle and Afu Ra (USA) \u2013 however, the album was never released.\n\nJulma-Henri found recognition with his debut studio album ''Al-Qaida Finland'' in 2005 while still residing in Oulu. In many of his releases, he used the name '''Julma-Henri & Syrj\u00e4ytyneet''' (Julma-Henri and the Marginalized). Julma-Henri always appears disguised without revealing much of his face. In 2005 and 2006, he had a joint radio show Bassoradio (a collective project of tens of DJs) with Steen 1 as ''Julma-Henri & Yst\u00e4v\u00e4t'' (meaning Julma-Henri & Friends) The title was \"Free Your Mind\" also touring Finland with Asa and Steen 1 and appearing in tracks in releases by them. In 2007, he appeared in a music video with Asa called \"240306\" (aka \"RikRek\"). In May 2007, Panama Rayon and Laineen Kasper reproduced and rereleased Julma-Henri's ''Al-Qaida Finland'' on Colin Records in Helsinki with great success. In January 2008, an all-Finland \"Support Al-Qaida Finland Tour\" was organized assisted by a number of rap and hip hop acts.\n\nBased on this success, he released in December 2008 the mixtape ''SRJTNT Vol 1'' criticizing commercialization of rap. It was produced by Panama Rayo. A number of appearances followed in a series of compilations like Asa's ''Via Karelia'', Aisti & Emeto's ''Exitus'' in the title track and Leijona's album ''Vauhtia ja vaarallisia tilanteita''. His 2009 release ''Outo nauha'' was a split album with Laineen Kasperi. In 2010, he released the album ''Psykoterapia'' again crediting Julma-Henri & Syrj\u00e4ytyneet and dealing, as many of his earlier albums with social exclusion and mental health problems and the dark side of life. The album was released on M\u00f6rssi record label and distributed by Playground Music. A single titled \"Kipu\" (meaning Pain) was released as a single. After ''Psykoterapia'', Julma-Henri & Syrj\u00e4ytyneet assembly broke in 2010 due to disagreements and Julma-Henri proceeded on collaborations with rapper [[RPK (rapper)|RPK]] (of Ceebrolistics fame) with joint ''Kutsu EP'' of 6 tracks released in December 2010 credited to '''Julma-Henri & RPK'''. \"Kutsu\" taken from the album was released as a music video. The follow-up album ''\"HENRI\"'' with 17 tracks from Julma-Henri & RPK in February 2013 produced another music video \"Pala\". Julma-Henri also contributed tracks to albums by Juju and Jontti.\n\nIn December 2011, Julma-Henri released his new album ''Radio Jihad... SRJTNT vol. 2''<ref name=nrgm>[http://www.nrgm.fi/kritiikit/julma-henri-radio-jihad-syrjaytynyt-vol-2/ nrgm.fi Review of Julma-Henri album \u2013 ''Radio Jihad: Syrj\u00e4ytynyt vol. 2''] {{in lang|fi}}</ref> as a follow-up to his successful ''SRJTNT Vol 1''  touching subjects of personal growth, recovery and hope from society's ills.

In addition to his solo act, he was part of rap band Forever from 1998 to 2001 under the name '''Money'''. He appeared in collective '''Julma-Henri & Syrj\u00e4ytyneet''' (2007\u20132010) and from 2010 strongly collaborated as duo Julma-Henri & RPK.<ref>[http://www.fullsteamrecords.com/app/artist/single/-/id/876 Fullsteam Records: JULMA HENRI & RPK page] {{in lang|fi}}</ref> With [[RPK (rapper)|RPK]], he launched an official duo rap act known as '''[[Eurocrack]]'''<ref name=rumba>{{cite news|url=http://www.rumba.fi/perjantaina-omalaatuiset-levynjulkkarit-keskella-katua-julma-henri-ja-rpk-tarjoavat-euro-crackia-36454/|author= |title=Perjantaina omalaatuiset levynjulkkarit keskell\u00e4 katua \u2013 Julma-Henri ja RPK tarjoavat Euro Crackia|publisher=Rumba.fi|date=28 June 2013|language=Finnish}}</ref>  (stylized as E U R O C R A C K) in 2012.\n\nJulma-Henri is known for his lurid and gritty sociopolitical lyrics. With names such as [[Steen1]] and Panama Rayo, he became famous for having remarkably darker, harder and more serious punk influenced lyrical tone compared to other Finnish rappers, who were famous for their relatively light-minded, punchline-centric lyrics. In the early 2000's, his music and public image were widely associated with [[anarchism]] and proletarian activism and he made a name for himself by performing in illegal parties, political protests and even riots. \n\n==Career==\nJulma-Henri began his career at Forever, a rap band he formed in Oulu in 1998 under the pseudonym Money. The band released the single \"Mobmusic\", a demo EP in 2000. The other members were OeO, Reksa ja Leijona. As Money, he released ''Soundtrack 2 My Life'', a self-financed and independently released album produced by RK-62 and Panama Rayo. In 2003, cooperated with Asa and [[Steen1]]. A number of collaborations followed and he appeared in mixtapes and compilations with notable tracks like \"Mit\u00e4 s\u00e4 tied\u00e4t\" and \"Vaan sil on v\u00e4li\u00e4\". In 2004, he worked on ''Soundtrack 2 My Life'' as a full album with appearances by Steen1, Tasis, Travis Bicle and Afu Ra (USA) \u2013 however, the album was never released.\n\nJulma-Henri found recognition with his debut studio album ''Al-Qaida Finland'' in 2005 while still residing in Oulu. In many of his releases, he used the name '''Julma-Henri & Syrj\u00e4ytyneet''' (Julma-Henri and the Marginalized). Julma-Henri always appears disguised without revealing much of his face. In 2005 and 2006, he had a joint radio show Bassoradio (a collective project of tens of DJs) with Steen 1 as ''Julma-Henri & Yst\u00e4v\u00e4t'' (meaning Julma-Henri & Friends) The title was \"Free Your Mind\" also touring Finland with Asa and Steen 1 and appearing in tracks in releases by them. In 2007, he appeared in a music video with Asa called \"240306\" (aka \"RikRek\"). In May 2007, Panama Rayon and Laineen Kasper reproduced and rereleased Julma-Henri's ''Al-Qaida Finland'' on Colin Records in Helsinki with great success. In January 2008, an all-Finland \"Support Al-Qaida Finland Tour\" was organized assisted by a number of rap and hip hop acts.\n\nBased on this success, he released in December 2008 the mixtape ''SRJTNT Vol 1'' criticizing commercialization of rap. It was produced by Panama Rayo. A number of appearances followed in a series of compilations like Asa's ''Via Karelia'', Aisti & Emeto's ''Exitus'' in the title track and Leijona's album ''Vauhtia ja vaarallisia tilanteita''. His 2009 release ''Outo nauha'' was a split album with Laineen Kasperi. In 2010, he released the album ''Psykoterapia'' again crediting Julma-Henri & Syrj\u00e4ytyneet and dealing, as many of his earlier albums with social exclusion and mental health problems and the dark side of life. The album was released on M\u00f6rssi record label and distributed by Playground Music. A single titled \"Kipu\" (meaning Pain) was released as a single. After ''Psykoterapia'', Julma-Henri & Syrj\u00e4ytyneet assembly broke in 2010 due to disagreements and Julma-Henri proceeded on collaborations with rapper [[RPK (rapper)|RPK]] (of Ceebrolistics fame) with joint ''Kutsu EP'' of 6 tracks released in December 2010 credited to '''Julma-Henri & RPK'''. \"Kutsu\" taken from the album was released as a music video. The follow-up album ''\"HENRI\"'' with 17 tracks from Julma-Henri & RPK in February 2013 produced another music video \"Pala\". Julma-Henri also contributed tracks to albums by Juju and Jontti.\n\nIn December 2011, Julma-Henri released his new album ''Radio Jihad... SRJTNT vol. 2''<ref name=nrgm>[http://www.nrgm.fi/kritiikit/julma-henri-radio-jihad-syrjaytynyt-vol-2/ nrgm.fi Review of Julma-Henri album \u2013 ''Radio Jihad: Syrj\u00e4ytynyt vol. 2''] {{in lang|fi}}</ref> as a follow-up to his successful ''SRJTNT Vol 1''  touching subjects of personal growth, recovery and hope from society's ills.

Three music videos were released: \"Punainen\", \"Radio Jihad\" and \"Kauppaan kauppaan\"\n\n===Eurocrack===\n{{Main|Eurocrack}}\nAs early as July 2011, and prior to ''Radio Jihad...'' release by Julma-Henri, RPK announced on [[Bassoradio]] that he was collaborating with Julma-Henri on a brand new project called Eurocrack and that an album was in the offing.

The two have been raised by Rishi's fun-loving and millionaire father Samarjit a.k.a. Sam ([[Amitabh Bachchan]]). Dev Saran ([[Shah Rukh Khan]]) is a successful soccer player in the United States who after winning one of his biggest games signs a $5 million contract. He lives in [[New York City]] with his wife Rhea ([[Preity Zinta]]), his son Arjun ([[Ahsaas Channa]]) and his mother Kamaljit a.k.a. Kamal ([[Kirron Kher]]). Maya encounters Dev moments before she is to marry Rishi. Although Dev and Maya are strangers, they connect instantly and moments after they part, Dev is hit by a car and permanently injures his leg, as a result, he loses his contract and can no longer play soccer ever again.\n\nFour years later, Dev is now extremely short tempered and bitter because of his inability to play soccer and Rhea's successful career makes him feel inferior to her. Maya too is in a similar situation. She has found that she is [[infertile]] and does not feel any love for Rishi because she believes he is childish. Dev and Maya meet each other and as a result of misunderstanding end up in the hospital. Rhea and Rishi are introduced and they strike a professional relationship. Dev and Maya witness them together and become jealous. They attend Sam's party together and during that the cracks in their respective marriages become visible to each other. Few days later, Dev and Maya witness Sam and Kamal embracing at a flower shop. Sam and Kamal explain that both, having lost their spouses, have decided to help one another through their loneliness by means of friendship. Dev and Maya decide to take a break from the stress of their respective relationships by becoming friends and support each other. In doing so, they find themselves drawn to one another.\n\nDev and Maya arrange a dinner for their respective spouses on the occasion of their wedding anniversaries so as to salvage their respective marriages. During the anniversary, both Dev and Maya have realised they have feelings for one another and not towards their respective partners. After returning home from the dinner, Rhea mentions that she received a promotion to which Dev tells her she is trying to show off to him knowing of his insecurity. Rhea then accuses Dev of being jealous of her professional success and also makes Dev realize his failure in his own life and of being a good husband and a good father to their son. Simultaneously, Rishi expresses his frustration at the lack of affection that Maya has shown towards him and in a burst of anger, finally opens up to his resentment towards Maya's inability to have children. Feeling worthless, Maya arrives at the train station and finds a disheartened Dev standing there before her. After confronting Dev, he finally confesses that he has fallen in love with Maya, and so has she.\n\nSensing the tension in their children's marriages, Sam and Kamal try to talk Rhea and Rishi into trying to reach out to their spouses and when they do, Dev and Maya start feeling guilty because they are happier with each other than with their respective spouses. The two couples attend a ballet, where Dev and Maya try making each other jealous by showing affection to their partners. The next day, they realize that they have been playing with their spouses' feelings and feel guilty but nevertheless give in and make love. \n\nThe next day, Sam invites the Sarans for a dinner party on the occasion of Kamal's birthday. At the party, after a conversation on love, marriage, and fidelity, Dev 'jokingly' confesses that he loves Maya. Sam senses that there was more to Dev's remark than light banter. The next day, Dev and Maya are caught in an embrace outside the train station by Sam and Kamal. Both Sam and Kamal are shocked and upset at the fact that Dev and Maya cheated on their spouses, despite both Rhea and Rishi's attempts to salvage their respective marriages. That night, Sam has a heart attack. On his deathbed, he advises Maya to leave Rishi as she was depriving Rishi and herself of true love and happiness in life. After Sam's death, Dev and Maya decide they must end their relationship and go back to their respective spouses, but first, they must tell them the truth about their extramarital affair, because neither of them would be able to move on with their spouses in the shadow of dishonesty. Shocked and heartbroken, Rhea and Rishi divorce their spouses. Dev and Maya lie to each other and say that they have managed to sort things out with their spouses, believing they'll never meet again. \n\nThree years have passed since their last encounter with each other. Dev and Maya have been living alone and miserably. Rishi visits Maya and says that he has fallen in love again and is remarrying. Rhea, having also been invited, arrives at Rishi's wedding with her boss Jay ([[Arjun Rampal]]), whom she is now dating. Rhea learns that Rishi and Maya are divorced \u2013 Rishi learns the same about Dev and Rhea. Rhea, after confronting Maya tells her that she had left Dev as soon as she came to know of his affair with her. Maya is encouraged by Rishi and Rhea to stop Dev, who is leaving for [[Toronto]] by train. At the train station, Dev sees Maya but tries to avoid her, believing she is still with Rishi. Maya sees him just as the train leaves. Dev, having seen Maya's teary eyes, pulls the emergency brake and arrives back at the station. He makes it back before Maya leaves the train station. They finally find happiness with their true love and decide to start a new life together. In the end, Dev mentions that true love should be the only foundation of a relationship. A flawed foundation would lead to the breakdown of the relationship, which in turn would lead to heartbreak.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n*[[Amitabh Bachchan]] as Samarjit Talwar a.k.a.

Produced by [[Dharma Productions]], the soundtrack was performed by the musical trio, [[Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy]] with lyrics written by [[Javed Akhtar]]. [[Farah Khan]] was brought in to organize the choreographical aspects of the film, with costume designer [[Manish Malhotra]], production designer [[Sharmishta Roy]] and [[MAC (cosmetics)|MAC]] cosmetics all playing a major role in production.\n\n[[Kajol]] was initially offered the role of Maya Talwar. When she refused, due to her prior commitments with [[Yash Raj Films]]'s ''[[Fanaa (film)|Fanaa]]'', the role was passed on to her cousin [[Rani Mukerji]], who was supposed to play [[Preity Zinta]]'s part. However, Kajol made a guest appearance in the song \"''Rock 'N' Roll Soniye''\".\n\n[[Riteish Deshmukh]] also had a guest appearance, but his scene was cut during the editing process.\n\n''Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna'' is set in [[New York City]], while many of the scenes were filmed in [[East Hartford]] and [[New Haven]] in [[Connecticut]]. The soccer game scene was filmed at [[Rentschler Field (stadium)|Rentschler Field]], the home of the [[UConn Huskies football team]]. In several scenes, a light '''UConn''<nowiki/>' can be seen on the field. The majority of the [[Grand Central Terminal|Grand Central Station]] scenes were filmed at New Haven's [[Union Station (New Haven)|Union Station]] and [[Philadelphia]]'s [[30th Street Station]].\n\nIn an interview, Karan Johar stated that the filming for the song \"Tumhi Dekho Naa\" was done at multiple locations and ended up being extremely time-consuming. The \"blue section\" of the song was shot at [[Columbia University]] in [[Upper West Side]], the \"yellow section\" was shot at [[Wall Street]] in [[Lower Manhattan]], the \"orange section\" at [[Bear Mountain State Park|Bear Mountain]], the \"red section\" at the [[Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey#Pier A|Pier A Park]] in [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]], and the \"green section\" at the Union Station in New Haven. The red section was initially designed to take place in the rain. However, due to the low temperatures, the raindrops produced by the rain machines started freezing in mid-air. This posed a risk of physical harm to the actors. Consequently, the filmmakers decided to do away with the rain. However, they still wanted to make use of the 200 red umbrellas they had purchased. Eventually, they decided to shoot the red section on a sunny day where the actors used the umbrellas to block out the sun. The shooting for the green section also ran into problems. Two hundred extras were hired for the section but only fifteen showed up. Consequently, crew members present on the set wore the green costumes to take their place. [[Ayan Mukerji]] who was an Assistant Director of the film can be seen in a green sweater carrying a box in one of the frames.\n\nThe movie was filmed over a 90-day shooting period in the USA but a few scenes were shot on four large sets in [[Mumbai]] studios.<ref>[http://www3.dharma-production.com/KANK/launch.html Official website of Dharma Productions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071126060438/http://www3.dharma-production.com/KANK/launch.html |date=26 November 2007 }}, Retrieved 31 January 2008</ref>\n\nMukerji suffered from a severe skin allergy during the filming in the US. \n\nLike previous [[Karan Johar]] movies (''[[Kuch Kuch Hota Hai]]'', ''[[Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...]]'' and ''[[Kal Ho Naa Ho]])'', ''Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna'' has a four-word title that starts with a \"''K''\".\n\n==Music==\n{{Infobox album\n| name         = Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna\n| type         = [[Soundtrack]]\n| artist       = [[Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy]]\n| cover        = \n| alt          = \n| released     = 12 June 2006 {{small|([[United Kingdom|UK]])}}<br/>16 June 2006 {{small|([[India]])}}\n| recorded     = \n| venue        = \n| studio       = \n| genre        = [[Film soundtrack|Feature film soundtrack]]\n| length       = 42:07\n| label        = [[Sony BMG]]\n| producer     = [[Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy]]\n| prev_title   = [[Dil Jo Bhi Kahey...]]\n| prev_year    = 2005\n| next_title   = [[Don - The Chase Begins Again]]\n| next_year    = 2006\n}}\n\nThe music and background score of ''Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna'' was composed by [[Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy]], while the lyrics were penned by [[Javed Akhtar]]. This is the second time that lyricist Javed Akhtar and the composers Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy have teamed up for a Dharma production. The trio also replaces Johar's usual collaborators [[Jatin\u2013Lalit]], who had composed for his previous films. The audio rights were acquired by [[Sony Music India]], under [[Sony BMG]], teaming up with [[Karan Johar]], for the third time after ''[[Kuch Kuch Hota Hai]]'' (1998) and ''[[Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...|Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...]]'' (2001).\n\nThe title song \"Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna\" rendered by [[Sonu Nigam]] and [[Alka Yagnik]] is a [[tear jerker|tearjerker]]. \"[[Mitwa]]\", an evocative [[sufi rock]] ballad, marked the introduction of Pakistani singer [[Shafqat Amanat Ali]] into the [[Bollywood]] scene. \"Where's The Party Tonight?\" by Shaan, [[Vasundhara Das]], [[Loy Mendonsa|Loy]] and Shankar Mahadevan is the [[Club music|club song]] picturized on Abhishek and Preity. Then follows \"Tumhi Dekho Naa\", a soft and romantic ballad, which again is sung by the Sonu Nigam - Alka Yagnik duo is picturized on Shah Rukh and Rani. \"Rock 'N' Roll Soniye\", picturized on Amitabh, Abhishek and Preity is a [[Rock 'N' Roll|60's Rock 'N' Roll]] track, sung by [[Shankar Mahadevan]], [[Shaan (singer)|Shaan]] and [[Mahalakshmi Iyer]]. \"Farewell Trance\" is the [[Trance music|trance]] version of the title track, which is a rarity in Bollywood.

The two have been raised by Rishi's fun-loving and millionaire father Samarjit a.k.a. Sam ([[Amitabh Bachchan]]). Dev Saran ([[Shah Rukh Khan]]) is a successful soccer player in the United States who after winning one of his biggest games signs a $5 million contract. He lives in [[New York City]] with his wife Rhea ([[Preity Zinta]]), his son Arjun ([[Ahsaas Channa]]) and his mother Kamaljit a.k.a. Kamal ([[Kirron Kher]]). Maya encounters Dev moments before she is to marry Rishi. Although Dev and Maya are strangers, they connect instantly and moments after they part, Dev is hit by a car and permanently injures his leg, as a result, he loses his contract and can no longer play soccer ever again.\n\nFour years later, Dev is now extremely short tempered and bitter because of his inability to play soccer and Rhea's successful career makes him feel inferior to her. Maya too is in a similar situation. She has found that she is [[infertile]] and does not feel any love for Rishi because she believes he is childish. Dev and Maya meet each other and as a result of misunderstanding end up in the hospital. Rhea and Rishi are introduced and they strike a professional relationship. Dev and Maya witness them together and become jealous. They attend Sam's party together and during that the cracks in their respective marriages become visible to each other. Few days later, Dev and Maya witness Sam and Kamal embracing at a flower shop. Sam and Kamal explain that both, having lost their spouses, have decided to help one another through their loneliness by means of friendship. Dev and Maya decide to take a break from the stress of their respective relationships by becoming friends and support each other. In doing so, they find themselves drawn to one another.\n\nDev and Maya arrange a dinner for their respective spouses on the occasion of their wedding anniversaries so as to salvage their respective marriages. During the anniversary, both Dev and Maya have realised they have feelings for one another and not towards their respective partners. After returning home from the dinner, Rhea mentions that she received a promotion to which Dev tells her she is trying to show off to him knowing of his insecurity. Rhea then accuses Dev of being jealous of her professional success and also makes Dev realize his failure in his own life and of being a good husband and a good father to their son. Simultaneously, Rishi expresses his frustration at the lack of affection that Maya has shown towards him and in a burst of anger, finally opens up to his resentment towards Maya's inability to have children. Feeling worthless, Maya arrives at the train station and finds a disheartened Dev standing there before her. After confronting Dev, he finally confesses that he has fallen in love with Maya, and so has she.\n\nSensing the tension in their children's marriages, Sam and Kamal try to talk Rhea and Rishi into trying to reach out to their spouses and when they do, Dev and Maya start feeling guilty because they are happier with each other than with their respective spouses. The two couples attend a ballet, where Dev and Maya try making each other jealous by showing affection to their partners. The next day, they realize that they have been playing with their spouses' feelings and feel guilty but nevertheless give in and make love. \n\nThe next day, Sam invites the Sarans for a dinner party on the occasion of Kamal's birthday. At the party, after a conversation on love, marriage, and fidelity, Dev 'jokingly' confesses that he loves Maya. Sam senses that there was more to Dev's remark than light banter. The next day, Dev and Maya are caught in an embrace outside the train station by Sam and Kamal. Both Sam and Kamal are shocked and upset at the fact that Dev and Maya cheated on their spouses, despite both Rhea and Rishi's attempts to salvage their respective marriages. That night, Sam has a heart attack. On his deathbed, he advises Maya to leave Rishi as she was depriving Rishi and herself of true love and happiness in life. After Sam's death, Dev and Maya decide they must end their relationship and go back to their respective spouses, but first, they must tell them the truth about their extramarital affair, because neither of them would be able to move on with their spouses in the shadow of dishonesty. Shocked and heartbroken, Rhea and Rishi divorce their spouses. Dev and Maya lie to each other and say that they have managed to sort things out with their spouses, believing they'll never meet again. \n\nThree years have passed since their last encounter with each other. Dev and Maya have been living alone and miserably. Rishi visits Maya and says that he has fallen in love again and is remarrying. Rhea, having also been invited, arrives at Rishi's wedding with her boss Jay ([[Arjun Rampal]]), whom she is now dating. Rhea learns that Rishi and Maya are divorced \u2013 Rishi learns the same about Dev and Rhea. Rhea, after confronting Maya tells her that she had left Dev as soon as she came to know of his affair with her. Maya is encouraged by Rishi and Rhea to stop Dev, who is leaving for [[Toronto]] by train. At the train station, Dev sees Maya but tries to avoid her, believing she is still with Rishi. Maya sees him just as the train leaves. Dev, having seen Maya's teary eyes, pulls the emergency brake and arrives back at the station. He makes it back before Maya leaves the train station. They finally find happiness with their true love and decide to start a new life together. In the end, Dev mentions that true love should be the only foundation of a relationship. A flawed foundation would lead to the breakdown of the relationship, which in turn would lead to heartbreak.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n*[[Amitabh Bachchan]] as Samarjit Talwar a.k.a.

Produced by [[Dharma Productions]], the soundtrack was performed by the musical trio, [[Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy]] with lyrics written by [[Javed Akhtar]]. [[Farah Khan]] was brought in to organize the choreographical aspects of the film, with costume designer [[Manish Malhotra]], production designer [[Sharmishta Roy]] and [[MAC (cosmetics)|MAC]] cosmetics all playing a major role in production.\n\n[[Kajol]] was initially offered the role of Maya Talwar. When she refused, due to her prior commitments with [[Yash Raj Films]]'s ''[[Fanaa (film)|Fanaa]]'', the role was passed on to her cousin [[Rani Mukerji]], who was supposed to play [[Preity Zinta]]'s part. However, Kajol made a guest appearance in the song \"''Rock 'N' Roll Soniye''\".\n\n[[Riteish Deshmukh]] also had a guest appearance, but his scene was cut during the editing process.\n\n''Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna'' is set in [[New York City]], while many of the scenes were filmed in [[East Hartford]] and [[New Haven]] in [[Connecticut]]. The soccer game scene was filmed at [[Rentschler Field (stadium)|Rentschler Field]], the home of the [[UConn Huskies football team]]. In several scenes, a light '''UConn''<nowiki/>' can be seen on the field. The majority of the [[Grand Central Terminal|Grand Central Station]] scenes were filmed at New Haven's [[Union Station (New Haven)|Union Station]] and [[Philadelphia]]'s [[30th Street Station]].\n\nIn an interview, Karan Johar stated that the filming for the song \"Tumhi Dekho Naa\" was done at multiple locations and ended up being extremely time-consuming. The \"blue section\" of the song was shot at [[Columbia University]] in [[Upper West Side]], the \"yellow section\" was shot at [[Wall Street]] in [[Lower Manhattan]], the \"orange section\" at [[Bear Mountain State Park|Bear Mountain]], the \"red section\" at the [[Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey#Pier A|Pier A Park]] in [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]], and the \"green section\" at the Union Station in New Haven. The red section was initially designed to take place in the rain. However, due to the low temperatures, the raindrops produced by the rain machines started freezing in mid-air. This posed a risk of physical harm to the actors. Consequently, the filmmakers decided to do away with the rain. However, they still wanted to make use of the 200 red umbrellas they had purchased. Eventually, they decided to shoot the red section on a sunny day where the actors used the umbrellas to block out the sun. The shooting for the green section also ran into problems. Two hundred extras were hired for the section but only fifteen showed up. Consequently, crew members present on the set wore the green costumes to take their place. [[Ayan Mukerji]] who was an Assistant Director of the film can be seen in a green sweater carrying a box in one of the frames.\n\nThe movie was filmed over a 90-day shooting period in the USA but a few scenes were shot on four large sets in [[Mumbai]] studios.<ref>[http://www3.dharma-production.com/KANK/launch.html Official website of Dharma Productions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071126060438/http://www3.dharma-production.com/KANK/launch.html |date=26 November 2007 }}, Retrieved 31 January 2008</ref>\n\nMukerji suffered from a severe skin allergy during the filming in the US. \n\nLike previous [[Karan Johar]] movies (''[[Kuch Kuch Hota Hai]]'', ''[[Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...]]'' and ''[[Kal Ho Naa Ho]])'', ''Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna'' has a four-word title that starts with a \"''K''\".\n\n==Music==\n{{Infobox album\n| name         = Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna\n| type         = [[Soundtrack]]\n| artist       = [[Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy]]\n| cover        = \n| alt          = \n| released     = 14 June 2006 {{small|([[United Kingdom|UK]])}}<br/>21 June 2006 {{small|([[India]])}}\n| recorded     = \n| venue        = \n| studio       = \n| genre        = [[Film soundtrack|Feature film soundtrack]]\n| length       = 42:07\n| label        = [[Sony BMG]]\n| producer     = [[Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy]]\n| prev_title   = [[Dil Jo Bhi Kahey...]]\n| prev_year    = 2005\n| next_title   = [[Don - The Chase Begins Again]]\n| next_year    = 2006\n}}\n\nThe music and background score of ''Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna'' was composed by [[Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy]], while the lyrics were penned by [[Javed Akhtar]]. This is the second time that lyricist Javed Akhtar and the composers Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy have teamed up for a Dharma production. The trio also replaces Johar's usual collaborators [[Jatin\u2013Lalit]], who had composed for his previous films. The audio rights were acquired by [[Sony Music India]], under [[Sony BMG]], teaming up with [[Karan Johar]], for the third time after ''[[Kuch Kuch Hota Hai]]'' (1998) and ''[[Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...|Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham]]'' (2001).\n\nThe title song \"Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna\" rendered by [[Sonu Nigam]] and [[Alka Yagnik]] is a [[tear jerker|tearjerker]]. \"[[Mitwa]]\", an evocative [[sufi rock]] ballad, marked the introduction of Pakistani singer [[Shafqat Amanat Ali]] into the [[Bollywood]] scene. \"Where's The Party Tonight?\" by Shaan, [[Vasundhara Das]], [[Loy Mendonsa|Loy]] and Shankar Mahadevan is the [[Club music|club song]] picturized on Abhishek and Preity.
