A [[Cavalier|Royalist]] cavalry force under [[Henry Wilmot, 1st Earl of Rochester|Lord Wilmot]] won a crushing victory over the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] under Sir [[William Waller]] who were besieging [[Devizes]] in central [[Wiltshire]] defended by [[Ralph Hopton|Lord Hopton]]. [[Roundway Down and Covert|Roundway Down]] and Oliver's Castle are about {{convert|1.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of Devizes and now form part of the North Wessex [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]].\n\n==Campaign==\nOn 5 July, Hopton's army had driven Waller from his position at the indecisive [[Battle of Lansdowne]]. In doing so the Royalists suffered many casualties and desertions. Sir [[Bevil Grenville]], the popular commander of Hopton's [[Cornwall|Cornish]] troops, was killed in the battle. Hopton himself was temporarily blinded the next day by an exploding ammunition cart. The explosion also left the Royalist army very short of [[gunpowder]] forcing them to withdraw towards [[Oxford]], the Royalist capital, in order to get reinforcements and new supplies.\n\nAlthough Waller's army had been forced to withdraw, it remained intact, and Waller quickly obtained reinforcements from the Parliamentarian garrison of [[Bristol]]. He followed Hopton's army closely and on the night of 8 July he occupied Roundway Down, the high ground north of Devizes, to barr a further retreat by the Royalists. The Royalists fell back into the town and their commanders held a hasty [[council of war]]. It was agreed that [[Prince Maurice von Simmern|Prince Maurice]] would break out and make for Oxford with the 300 cavalry remaining with the Royalist army. While Hopton's Cornish infantry defended Devizes, Maurice was to collect a relieving force from Oxford.\n\nMaurice and his 300 horse escaped just before Waller surrounded Devizes. Unaware of Maurice's escape to Oxford, Waller set up his guns and began a siege of the vulnerable unfortified town the next day. On 12 July he captured a convoy bringing ammunition to Hopton and demanded a surrender. The surrender was refused and the next morning the Royalist relief force appeared on Roundway Down.\n\nMaurice had reached Oxford late on 10 July. [[Henry Wilmot, 1st Earl of Rochester|Lord Wilmot]], Lieutenant General of Horse for [[Charles I of England|King Charles]] set out almost at once for Devizes with 1,500 cavalry and two light \"[[galloper gun]]s\", an early form of horse artillery, collecting Maurice's 300 horse on the way.\n\n==Battle==\nEarly on the morning of 13 July, Wilmot's relieving force reached Roughridge Hill, {{convert|5|mi|km}} north east of Devizes and fired two rounds from their guns as a signal to the besieged. They were organised as two strong brigades under Wilmot himself and Sir [[John Byron, 1st Baron Byron|John Byron]] and a weaker brigade under [[Ludovic Lindsay, 16th Earl of Crawford|Lord Crawford]].\n\nWaller had been informed of their arrival, and he abandoned the siege and marched to Roundway Down, hoping to defeat Wilmot before Hopton could sally from Devizes against his rear. He deployed his infantry and artillery in the centre of his line, with cavalry on each flank. Recent findings of cannonballs and musket and pistol shot have suggested that the site of the battle was not on the highest point of the down, but close to Oliver's castle, the site of an Iron Age [[Hillfort]] in front of what is today the Roundway Covert.<ref>The Battle of Roundway Down, Devizes Heritage.</ref> (\"Oliver's Castle\" was named after [[Oliver Cromwell]] even though he was not present.)<ref>Roundway Hill Covert and immediate surroundings.</ref><ref>The Battle of Roundway Down, 1643.</ref>\n\nAlthough Waller held the higher ground, the Royalists attacked first. Wilmot's brigade attacked the Parliamentarian left. The leading troops of this Parliamentarian wing were a fully armoured regiment of [[cuirassiers]], the [[London lobsters]] under Sir [[Arthur Haselrig]]. They appeared to have met Wilmot's charge at the halt, and were thrown into confusion and driven back into their second line. After a brief contest, they retreated in disorder.\n\n[[File:Access land west of the Mid Wilts Way near Heddington - geograph.org.uk - 1535578.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The view from the scarp known as 'Oliver's Castle' into the 'Bloody Ditch']]\n\nByron attacked the Parliamentarian right, commanded by Waller, under fire from the guns and musketeers of their centre.

They captured at least four of the Parliamentarians' cannons and turned them on the infantry. The 2,000 Roundhead foot held out for a while, until Hopton's infantry, who had marched up from Devizes Castle, deployed to attack. The Roundheads then tried to retreat northwards, but failed and the survivors threw down their arms. About 600 Parliamentarian troops were killed and some 1,000 were captured.\n\n==Aftermath==\nRoundway Down was the greatest cavalry victory of the English Civil War. The Royalists christened the battle \"Runaway Down\". The defeat of an army arrayed in proper battle order on high ground by a column of cavalry that had just ridden down from Oxford was regarded as remarkable.\n\nWaller had previously been favoured to replace the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] as lord general of the Parliamentarian armies. His defeat at Roundway Down made this impossible. Waller and his supporters criticised Essex for his perceived inactivity, which had allowed the royalists to detach Wilmot's cavalry from Oxford.\n\nThe Parliamentarian field army in south-west England was destroyed, allowing the Royalists to [[Storming of Bristol|capture the port and major city of Bristol]] a few weeks later; this period of Royalist successes was referred to as the \"Royalist summer\".\n\nThe \"village\" of Roundway is today a small hamlet {{convert|2|km|mi}} north of central Devizes, with a population of around 25 residents.

Also, after a year it is estimated that a sizable quantity of fission products move from the northern to the southern stratosphere. The intermediate time scale is between 1\u201330 days, with long term fallout occurring after that. \n\nExamples of both intermediate and long term fallout occurred after the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl accident]]. Chernobyl was a nuclear power facility in the Soviet Union. In 1986 it accidentally contaminated over about 5 million acres in [[Ukraine]]. The main fuel of the reactor was [[uranium]], and surrounding this was graphite, both of which were vaporized by the hydrogen explosion that destroyed the reactor and breached its containment. An estimated 31 people died within a few weeks after this happened, including two plant workers killed at the scene. Although residents were evacuated within 36 hours, people started to complain of vomiting, migraines and other major signs of [[Acute radiation syndrome|radiation sickness]]. The officials of Ukraine had to close off an 18-mile area. Long term effects included at least 6000 cases of [[thyroid cancer]], mainly among children. Fallout spread throughout Western Europe, with Northern Scandinavia receiving a heavy dose, contaminating reindeer herds in Lapland, and salad greens becoming almost unavailable in France.\n\n===Local fallout===\nDuring detonations of devices at ground level (''[[ground burst|surface burst]]''), below the fallout-free altitude, or in shallow water, heat [[vapor]]izes large amounts of earth or water, which is drawn up into the [[mushroom cloud|radioactive cloud]]. This material becomes radioactive when it combines with [[fission products]] or other radiocontaminants, or when it is [[neutron activation|neutron-activated]].\n\nThe table below summarizes the abilities of common isotopes to form fallout. Some radiation taints large amounts of land and [[drinking water]] causing formal [[mutation]]s throughout animal and human life.\n\n[[Image:Bravo fallout2.png|right|300px|thumb|The {{convert|280|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} fallout plume from 15 Mt shot [[Castle Bravo]], 1954]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible\"\n|+ Table (according to T.

More than half the total bomb debris lands on the ground within about 24 hours as local fallout.<ref name=\"KDFOC3\">{{cite book |last1=Harvey |first1=T. |title=KDFOC3: A Nuclear Fallout Assessment Capability |date=1992 |publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories |url=https://narac.llnl.gov/content/mods/publications/op-model-description-evaluation/UCRL-TM-222788.pdf |accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref> Chemical properties of the elements in the fallout control the rate at which they are deposited on the ground. Less volatile elements deposit first.\n\nSevere local fallout contamination can extend far beyond the blast and thermal effects, particularly in the case of high yield surface detonations. The ground track of fallout from an explosion depends on the weather from the time of detonation onwards. In stronger winds, fallout travels faster but takes the same time to descend, so although it covers a larger path, it is more spread out or diluted. Thus, the width of the fallout pattern for any given dose rate is reduced where the downwind distance is increased by higher winds. The total amount of activity deposited up to any given time is the same irrespective of the wind pattern, so overall casualty figures from fallout are generally independent of winds. But [[thunderstorm]]s can bring down activity as [[rain]] allows fallout to drop more rapidly, particularly if the [[mushroom cloud]] is low enough to be below (\"washout\"), or mixed with (\"rainout\"), the thunderstorm.\n\nWhenever individuals remain in a [[radioactive contamination|radiologically contaminated]] area, such contamination leads to an immediate external radiation exposure as well as a possible later internal hazard from inhalation and ingestion of radiocontaminants, such as the rather short-lived [[iodine-131]], which is accumulated in the [[thyroid]].\n\n==Factors affecting fallout==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:1957.JPG|right|300px|thumb|Nevada nuclear test total fallout outdoor gamma doses, 1950\u201357. The fallout is to the north and east because testing was only allowed when the wind was blowing in those directions.]] -->\n\n===Location===\nThere are two main considerations for the location of an explosion: height and surface composition. A nuclear weapon detonated in the air, called an [[air burst]], produces less fallout than a comparable explosion near the ground. A nuclear explosion in which the fireball touches the ground pulls soil and other materials into the cloud and neutron activates it before it falls back to the ground.  An air burst produces a relatively small amount of the highly radioactive heavy metal components of the device itself.\n\nIn case of water surface bursts, the particles tend to be rather lighter and smaller, producing less local fallout but extending over a greater area. The particles contain mostly [[sea salt]]s with some water; these can have a [[cloud seeding]] effect causing local [[rainout]] and areas of high local fallout. Fallout from a [[seawater]] burst is difficult to remove once it has soaked into [[porous]] surfaces because the fission products are present as metallic [[ion]]s that chemically bond to many surfaces. Water and detergent washing effectively removes less than 50% of this chemically bonded activity from [[concrete]] or [[steel]]. Complete decontamination requires aggressive treatment like [[sandblasting]], or acidic treatment. After the ''Crossroads'' underwater test, it was found that wet fallout must be immediately removed from ships by continuous water washdown (such as from the [[fire sprinkler]] system on the decks).\n\nParts of the sea bottom may become fallout. After the [[Castle Bravo]] test, white dust\u2014contaminated [[calcium oxide]] particles originating from pulverized and [[calcination|calcined]] [[coral]]s\u2014fell for several hours, causing [[beta burn]]s and radiation exposure to the inhabitants of the nearby atolls and the crew of the ''[[Daigo Fukury\u016b Maru]]'' fishing boat. The scientists called the fallout ''Bikini snow''.\n\nFor subsurface bursts, there is an additional phenomenon present called \"[[base surge]]\". The base surge is a cloud that rolls outward from the bottom of the subsiding column, which is caused by an excessive density of dust or water droplets in the air. For underwater bursts, the visible surge is, in effect, a cloud of liquid (usually water) droplets with the property of flowing almost as if it were a homogeneous fluid. After the water evaporates, an invisible base surge of small radioactive particles may persist.\n\nFor subsurface land bursts, the surge is made up of small solid particles, but it still behaves like a [[fluid]]. A soil earth medium favors base surge formation in an underground burst. Although the base surge typically contains only about 10% of the total bomb debris in a subsurface burst, it can create larger radiation doses than fallout near the detonation, because it arrives sooner than fallout, before much radioactive decay has occurred.\n\n===Meteorological===\n[[Image:Fallout G&D77.JPG|right|300px|thumb|Comparison of fallout gamma dose and dose rate contours for a 1 Mt fission land surface burst, based on DELFIC calculations. Because of radioactive decay, the dose rate contours contract after fallout has arrived, but dose contours continue to grow.]]\n\n[[Meteorology|Meteorological]] conditions greatly influence fallout, particularly local fallout. Atmospheric winds are able to bring fallout over large areas. For example, as a result of a ''[[Castle Bravo]]'' surface burst of a 15 Mt thermonuclear device at [[Bikini Atoll]] on March 1, 1954, a roughly cigar-shaped area of the [[Pacific]] extending over 500&nbsp;km downwind and varying in width to a maximum of 100&nbsp;km was severely contaminated. There are three very different versions of the fallout pattern from this test, because the fallout was only measured on a small number of widely spaced Pacific Atolls. The two alternative versions both ascribe the high radiation levels at north [[Rongelap]] to a downwind hotspot caused by the large amount of radioactivity carried on fallout particles of about 50\u2013100 micrometres size.<ref>{{cite journal|publisher=General Electric Company|editor=Howard A.

In other 1954 tests, including ''Yankee'' and ''Nectar,'' hotspots were mapped out by ships with submersible probes, and similar hotspots occurred in 1956 tests such as ''Zuni'' and ''Tewa''.\n<ref>{{cite journal|publisher=US Naval Radiological Defense Laboratory|author=Project Officer T.

Under special meteorological conditions, such as a local rain shower that originates above the radioactive cloud, limited areas of heavy contamination just downwind of a nuclear blast may be formed.\n\n==Effects==\nA wide range of [[biological process|biological]] changes may follow the irradiation of animals. These vary from rapid death following high doses of penetrating whole-body radiation, to essentially normal lives for a variable period of time until the development of delayed radiation effects, in a portion of the exposed population, following low dose exposures.\n\nThe unit of actual ''exposure'' is the [[Roentgen (unit)|r\u00f6ntgen]], defined in [[ionisation]]s per unit volume of air. All ionisation based instruments (including [[geiger counter]]s and [[ionisation chamber]]s) measure exposure. However, effects depend on the energy per unit mass, not the exposure measured in air. A deposit of 1 joule per kilogram has the unit of 1 [[gray (unit)|gray]] (Gy). For 1 MeV energy gamma rays, an exposure of 1 r\u00f6ntgen in air produces a dose of about 0.01 gray (1 centigray, cGy) in water or surface tissue. Because of shielding by the tissue surrounding the bones, the [[bone marrow]] only receives about 0.67 cGy when the air exposure is 1 r\u00f6ntgen and the surface skin dose is 1 cGy. Some lower values reported for the amount of radiation that would kill 50% of personnel (the {{LD50}}) refer to bone marrow dose, which is only 67% of the air dose.\n\n===Short term===\n{{further|LD50|l1=LD<sub>50</sub>}}\n\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2008}}\n[[File:Fallout shelter sign on a building.JPG|thumb|[[Fallout shelter]] sign on a building in [[New York City]]]]\nThe dose that would be lethal to 50% of a population is a common parameter used to compare the effects of various fallout types or circumstances. Usually, the term is defined for a specific time, and limited to studies of acute lethality. The common time periods used are 30 days or less for most small laboratory animals and to 60 days for large animals and humans. The LD<Sub>50</Sub> figure assumes that the individuals did not receive other injuries or medical treatment.\n\nIn the 1950s, the LD<Sub>50</Sub> for gamma rays was set at 3.5 Gy, while under more dire conditions of war (a bad diet, little medical care, poor nursing) the LD<Sub>50</Sub> was 2.5 Gy (250 rad). There have been few documented cases of survival beyond 6 Gy. One person at [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] survived a dose of more than 10 Gy, but many of the persons exposed there were not uniformly exposed over their entire body. If a person is exposed in a non-homogeneous manner then a given dose (averaged over the entire body) is less likely to be lethal. For instance, if a person gets a hand/low arm dose of 100 Gy, which gives them an overall dose of 4 Gy, they are more likely to survive than a person who gets a 4 Gy dose over their entire body. A hand dose of 10 Gy or more would likely result in loss of the hand.

The team sent collection forms to schools in the [[St. Louis, Missouri]] area, hoping to gather 50,000 teeth each year.

[[Acute radiation syndrome|Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS)]] is the most immediate risk to humans when exposed to [[ionizing radiation]] in dosages greater than around 0.1 [[Gray (unit)|Gy/hr]]. Radiation in the low energy spectrum ([[Alpha Radiation|alpha]] and [[Beta Radiation|beta radiation]]) with minimal penetrating power is unlikely to cause significant damage to internal organs. The high penetrating power of [[Gamma Radiation|gamma]] and [[neutron radiation]], however, easily penetrates the skin and many thin shielding mechanisms to cause cellular degeneration in the stem cells found in bone marrow. While full body shielding in a secure fallout shelter as described above is the most optimal form of radiation protection, it requires being locked in a very thick bunker for a significant amount of time. In the event of a nuclear catastrophe of any kind, it is imperative to have [[Radiation protection#Externally Penetrating Radiation Protective Equipment|mobile protection equipment]] for medical and security personnel to perform necessary containment, evacuation, and any number of other important public safety objectives. The mass of the shielding material required to properly protect the entire body from high energy radiation would make functional movement essentially impossible. This has led scientists to begin researching the idea of partial body protection: a strategy inspired by [[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)]]. The idea is to use enough shielding material to sufficiently protect the high concentration of bone marrow in the pelvic region, which contains enough regenerative stem cells to repopulate the body with unaffected bone marrow.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Waterman|first=Gideon|last2=Kase|first2=Kenneth|last3=Orion|first3=Itzhak|last4=Broisman|first4=Andrey|last5=Milstein|first5=Oren|date=29 March 2017|title=Selective Shielding of Bone Marrow: An Approach to Protecting Humans from External Gamma Radiation|journal=The Radiation Safety Journal: Health Physics|volume=113|issue=3|pages=195\u2013208|doi=10.1097/HP.0000000000000688|pmid=28749810}}</ref> More information on bone marrow shielding can be found in the [https://journals.lww.com/health-physics/pages/default.aspx Health Physics Radiation Safety Journal] article [https://journals.lww.com/health-physics/Abstract/2017/09000/Selective_Shielding_of_Bone_Marrow___An_Approach.4.aspx Selective Shielding of Bone Marrow: An Approach to Protecting Humans from External Gamma Radiation], or in the [[OECD|Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)]] and the [[Nuclear Energy Agency|Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA)]]'s 2015 report: [https://www.oecd-nea.org/rp/docs/2014/crpph-r2014-5.pdf Occupational Radiation Protection in Severe Accident Management.]\n\n===The Seven Ten Rule===\nThe danger of radiation from fallout also decreases rapidly with time due in large part to the exponential decay of the individual radionuclides.

A significant amount of materials of this type are necessary to protect a person from fallout radiation, so safety clothing cannot protect a person from fallout radiation.<ref name=\"protection2\" /><ref name=\"protection\" /> However, protective clothing can keep fallout particles off a person's body, but the radiation from these particles will still permeate through the clothing. For safety clothing to be able to block the fallout radiation, it would have to be so thick and heavy that a person could not function.<ref name=\"protection\" />\n\nThese guides indicated that [[fallout shelters]] should contain enough resources to keep its occupants alive for up to two weeks.<ref name=\"protection\" /> Community shelters were preferred over single-family shelters. The more people in a shelter, the greater quantity and variety of resources that shelter would be equipped with. These communities\u2019 shelters would also help facilitate efforts to recuperate the community in the future.<ref name=\"protection\" /> Single family shelters should be built below ground if possible. Many different types of [[fallout shelters]] could be made for a relatively small amount of money.<ref name=\"protection\" /><ref name=\"protection2\" /> A common format for [[fallout shelters]] was to build the shelter underground, with solid concrete blocks to act as the roof. If a shelter could only be partially underground, it was recommended to mound over that shelter with as much dirt as possible. If a house had a basement, it is best for a [[fallout shelter]] to be constructed in a corner of the basement.<ref name=\"protection\" /> The center of a basement is where the most radiation will be because the easiest way for radiation to enter a basement is from the floor above.<ref name=\"protection2\" /> The two of the walls of the shelter in a basement corner will be the basement walls that are surrounded by dirt outside. Cinder blocks filled with sand or dirt were highly recommended for the other two walls.<ref name=\"protection2\" /> Concrete blocks, or some other dense material, should be used as a roof for a basement fallout shelter because the floor of a house is not an adequate roof for a [[fallout shelter]].<ref name=\"protection2\" /> These shelters should contain water, food, tools, and a method for dealing with human waste.<ref name=\"protection2\" />\n\nIf a person did not have a shelter previously built, these guides recommended trying to get underground. If a person had a basement but no shelter, they should put food, water, and a waste container in the corner of the basement.<ref name=\"protection2\" /> Then items such as furniture should be piled up to create walls around the person in the corner.<ref name=\"protection2\" /> The more things a person can surround themselves with the better. If the underground cannot be reached, a tall apartment building at least ten miles from the blast was recommended as a good fallout shelter. People in these buildings should get as close to the center of the building as possible and avoid the top and ground floors.<ref name=\"protection\" /> Once again, people should surround themselves with whatever they can find and acquire whatever resources they can to create a barrier between themselves and fallout particles and radiation.\n\nDuring this time, schools were a favorable place to act as a [[fallout shelter]] according to the [[Office of Civil Defense]].<ref name=\"school3\" /><ref name=\"school1\" /> For starters, schools, not including universities, contained one-quarter of the population of the United States when they were in session at that time.<ref name=\"school1\" /> Schools distribution across the nation reflected the density of the population and were often a best building in a community to act as a fallout shelter. Also, schools also already had organization with leaders set in place.<ref name=\"school1\" /><ref name=\"school1\" /> The [[Office of Civil Defense]] recommended altering current schools and the construction of future schools to include thicker walls and roofs, better protected electrical systems, a purifying ventilation system, and a protected water pump.<ref name=\"school3\" /> The [[Office of Civil Defense]] determined 10 square feet of net area per person were necessary in schools that were to function as a fallout shelter. A normal classroom could provide 180 people with area to sleep.<ref name=\"school1\" /> If an attack were to happen, all the unnecessary furniture was to be moved out of the classrooms to make more room for people.<ref name=\"school1\" /> It was recommended to keep one or two tables in the room if possible to use as a food serving station.<ref name=\"school1\" />\n\nThe [[Office of Civil Defense]] conducted four case studies to find the cost of turning four standing schools into fallout shelters and what their capacity would be. The cost of the schools per occupant in the 1960s were $66.00, $127.00, $50.00, and $180.00.<ref name=\"school1\" /> The capacity of people these schools could house as shelters were 735, 511, 484, and 460 respectively.<ref name=\"school1\" />\n\n==Nuclear reactor accident==\n{{See also|Comparison of Chernobyl and other radioactivity releases}}\nFallout can also refer to [[nuclear accident]]s, although a [[nuclear reactor]] does not explode like a nuclear weapon. The [[isotopic signature]] of bomb fallout is very different from the fallout from a serious power reactor accident (such as [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] or [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents|Fukushima]]).\n\nThe key differences are in [[volatility (chemistry)|volatility]] and [[half-life]].\n\n===Volatility===\nThe [[boiling point]] of an [[chemical element|element]] (or its [[chemical compound|compound]]s) is able to control the percentage of that element a power reactor accident releases. The ability of an element to form a solid controls the rate it is deposited on the ground after having been injected into the atmosphere by a nuclear detonation or accident.\n\n===Half-life===\nA [[half life]] is the time it takes half of the radiation of a specific substance to decay. A large amount of short-lived isotopes such as <sup>97</sup>Zr are present in bomb fallout. This isotope and other short-lived isotopes are constantly generated in a power reactor, but because the [[critical mass|criticality]] occurs over a long length of time, the majority of these short lived isotopes decay before they can be released.\n\n===Preventative measures===\nNuclear fallout can occur due to a number of different sources. One of the most common potential sources of nuclear fallout is that of [[nuclear reactors]]. Because of this, steps must be taken to ensure the risk of nuclear fallout at nuclear reactors is controlled. \nIn the 1950s and 60's, the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC) began developing safety regulations against nuclear fallout for civilian nuclear reactors. Because the effects of nuclear fallout are more widespread and longer lasting than other forms of energy production accidents, the AEC desired a more proactive response towards potential accidents than ever before.<ref name=\"Uncertainty 846\u2013884\">{{cite journal |last1=Wellock |first1=Thomas |title=Engineering Uncertainty and Bureaucratic Crisis at the Atomic Energy Commission |journal=Technology and Culture |date=October 2012 |volume=53 |issue=4 |pages=846\u2013884|doi=10.1353/tech.2012.0144 }}</ref> One step to prevent nuclear reactor accidents was the [[Price-Anderson Act]]. Passed by Congress in 1957, the Price-Anderson Act ensured government assistance above the $60 million covered by private insurance companies in the case of a nuclear reactor accident. The main goal of the Price-Anderson Act was to protect the multibillion-dollar companies overseeing the production of nuclear reactors. Without this protection, the nuclear reactor industry could potentially come to a halt, and the protective measures against nuclear fallout would be reduced.<ref name=\"Probabilistic 920\u2013941\">{{cite journal |last1=Carlisle |first1=Rodney |title=Probabilistic Risk Assessment in Nuclear Reactors: Engineering Success, Public Relation Failure |journal=Technology and Culture |date=October 1997 |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=920\u2013941|doi=10.2307/3106954 |jstor=3106954 }}</ref> However, because of the limited experience in nuclear reactor technology, engineers had a difficult time calculating the potential risk of released radiation.<ref name=\"Probabilistic 920\u2013941\"/> Engineers were forced to imagine every unlikely accident, and the potential fallout associated with each accident. The AEC's regulations against potential nuclear reactor fallout were centered on the ability of the power plant to the Maximum Credible Accident, or MCA. The MCA involved a \"large release of radioactive isotopes after a substantial meltdown of the reactor fuel when the reactor coolant system failed through a Loss-of-Coolant Accident\".<ref name=\"Uncertainty 846\u2013884\"/> The prevention of the MCA enabled a number of new nuclear fallout preventative measures. Static safety systems, or systems without power sources or user input, were enabled to prevent potential human error. Containment buildings, for example, were reliably effective at containing a release of radiation and did not need to be powered or turned on to operate. Active protective systems, although far less dependable, can do many things that static systems cannot. For example, a system to replace the escaping steam of a cooling system with cooling water could prevent reactor fuel from melting. However, this system would need a sensor to detect the presence of releasing steam. Sensors can fail, and the results of a lack of preventative measures would result in a local nuclear fallout. The AEC had to choose, then, between active and static systems to protect the public from nuclear fallout. With a lack of set standards and probabilistic calculations, the AEC and the industry became divided on the best safety precautions to use. \nThis division gave rise to the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]], or NRC. The NRC was committed to 'regulations through research', which gave the regulatory committee a knowledge bank of research on which to draw their regulations. Much of the research done by the NRC sought to move safety systems from a deterministic viewpoint into a new probabilistic approach. The deterministic approach sought to foresee all problems before they arose. The probabilistic approach uses a more mathematical approach to weigh the risks of potential radiation leaks. Much of the probabilistic safety approach can be drawn from the [[radiative transfer]] theory in [[Physics]], which describes how radiation travels in free space and through barriers.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Shore |first1=Steven |title=Blue Sky and Hot Piles: The Evolution of Radiative Transfer Theory from Atmospheres to Nuclear Reactors |journal=Historia Mathematica |date=2002 |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=463\u2013489 |doi=10.1006/hmat.2002.2360|doi-access=free }}</ref> Today, the NRC is still the leading regulatory committee on nuclear reactor power plants.\n\n== Determining extent of nuclear fallout ==\nThe [[International Nuclear Event Scale|International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale]] (INES) is the primary form of categorizing the potential health and environmental effects of a nuclear or radiological event and communicating it to the public.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.iaea.org/topics/emergency-preparedness-and-response-epr/international-nuclear-radiological-event-scale-ines|title=International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale (INES)|date=2017-11-22|website=www.iaea.org|access-date=2019-04-19}}</ref> The scale, which was developed in 1990 by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] and the Nuclear Energy Agency of the [[OECD|Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development]], classifies these nuclear accidents based off the potential impact of the fallout:<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/ines.pdf|title=INES: The International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale|website=The International Atomic Energy Agency}}</ref>\n\n* Defence-in-Depth: This is the lowest form of nuclear accidents and refers to events that have no direct impact on people or the environment but must be taken note of to improve future safety measures. \n* Radiological Barriers and Control: This category refers to events that have no direct impact on people or the environment and only refer to the damage caused within major facilities.\n* People and the Environment: This section of the scale consists of more serious nuclear accidents.

However, without a proper policing force, the guidelines set forth by the IAEA were often treated lightly or ignored completely. In 1986, the disaster at [[Chernobyl]] was evidence that international nuclear reactor safety was not to be taken lightly. Even in the midst of the [[Cold War]], the Nuclear Regulatory Commission sought to improve the safety of Soviet nuclear reactors. As noted by IAEA Director General [[Hans Blix]], \"A radiation cloud doesn't know international boundaries.\"<ref name=\"Children 3\u201332\">{{cite journal |last1=Wellock |first1=Thomas |title=The Children of Chernobyl: Engineers and the Campaign for Safety |journal=History and Technology |date=2013 |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=3\u201332 |doi=10.1080/07341512.2013.785719 }}</ref> The NRC showed the Soviets the safety guidelines used in the US: capable regulation, safety-minded operations, and effective plant designs. The soviets, however, had their own priority: keeping the plant running at all costs. In the end, the same shift between deterministic safety designs to probabilistic safety designs prevailed. In 1989, the [[World Association of Nuclear Operators]] (WANO) was formed to cooperate with the IAEA to ensure the same three pillars of reactor safety across international borders. In 1991, WANO concluded (using a probabilistic safety approach) that all former communist-controlled nuclear reactors could not be trusted, and should be closed. Compared to a \"Nuclear [[Marshall Plan]]\", efforts were taken throughout the 1990s and 2000s to ensure international standards of safety for all nuclear reactors.<ref name=\"Children 3\u201332\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Dirty bomb]]\n* [[Nuclear terrorism]]\n* ''[[Fallout: An American Nuclear Tragedy]]''\n* ''[[Fallout Protection]]''\u2014U.S. government booklet\n* [[Effects of nuclear explosions]]\n* [[Fallout (RT\u00c9 drama)|''Fallout'' (RT\u00c9 drama)]]\u2014Irish drama exploring scenarios following a nuclear accident at [[Sellafield]].\n* [[Fallout (series)]]\n* [[Fallout shelter]]\n* [[Fission product]]\n* [[Hot Particle]]\n* [[Human radiation experiments]]\n* [[List of nuclear accidents]]\n* [[Lists of nuclear disasters and radioactive incidents]]\n* [[Neutron bomb]]\n* [[Mutation breeding#Radiation breeding]]\n* [[Nuclear terrorism]]\n* ''[[Nuclear war survival skills]]'' by [[Cresson Kearny]]\n* [[Nuclear weapon design]]\n* [[Potassium iodide]]\n* [[Project GABRIEL]]\n* ''[[Protect and Survive]]'', a series of booklets and a [[public information film]] series produced for the British government in the 1970s and 1980s.\n* [[Radioactive contamination]]\n* [[Radiation poisoning]]\n* [[Radiation biology]]\n* [[Radioactive waste]]\n* [[Radiological weapon]]\n* [[Joseph Rotblat]]\n* [[Salted bomb]] \n* ''[[Survival Under Atomic Attack]]'', an official U.S. government booklet regarding the effects of a nuclear attack.\n* [[Nuclear fallout effects on an ecosystem]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Glasstone, Samuel and Dolan, Philip J., ''The Effects of Nuclear Weapons (third edition)'', U.S. Government Printing Office, 1977.

Exposure can be on an intermediate time scale or long term.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK219147/|title=Radioactive Fallout|last=Marston|first=Robert Q.|last2=Solomon|first2=Fred|last3=War|first3=Institute of Medicine (US) Steering Committee for the Symposium on the Medical Implications of Nuclear|date=1986|publisher=National Academies Press (US)}}</ref> The intermediate time scale results from fallout that has been put into the troposphere and ejected by precipitation during the first month.

Also, after a year it is estimated that a sizable quantity of fission products move from the northern to the southern stratosphere. The intermediate time scale is between 1\u201330 days, with long term fallout occurring after that. \n\nExamples of both intermediate and long term fallout occurred after the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl accident]]. Chernobyl was a nuclear power facility in the Soviet Union. In 1986 it accidentally contaminated over about 5 million acres in [[Ukraine]]. The main fuel of the reactor was [[uranium]], and surrounding this was graphite, both of which were vaporized by the hydrogen explosion that destroyed the reactor and breached its containment. An estimated 31 people died within a few weeks after this happened, including two plant workers killed at the scene. Although residents were evacuated within 36 hours, people started to complain of vomiting, migraines and other major signs of [[Acute radiation syndrome|radiation sickness]]. The officials of Ukraine had to close off an 18-mile area. Long term effects included at least 6000 cases of [[thyroid cancer]], mainly among children. Fallout spread throughout Western Europe, with Northern Scandinavia receiving a heavy dose, contaminating reindeer herds in Lapland, and salad greens becoming almost unavailable in France.\n\n===Local fallout===\nDuring detonations of devices at ground level (''[[ground burst|surface burst]]''), below the fallout-free altitude, or in shallow water, heat [[vapor]]izes large amounts of earth or water, which is drawn up into the [[mushroom cloud|radioactive cloud]]. This material becomes radioactive when it combines with [[fission products]] or other radiocontaminants, or when it is [[neutron activation|neutron-activated]].\n\nThe table below summarizes the abilities of common isotopes to form fallout. Some radiation taints large amounts of land and [[drinking water]] causing formal [[mutation]]s throughout animal and human life.\n\n[[Image:Bravo fallout2.png|right|300px|thumb|The {{convert|280|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} fallout plume from 15 Mt shot [[Castle Bravo]], 1954]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible\"\n|+ Table (according to T.

More than half the total bomb debris lands on the ground within about 24 hours as local fallout.<ref name=\"KDFOC3\">{{cite book |last1=Harvey |first1=T. |title=KDFOC3: A Nuclear Fallout Assessment Capability |date=1992 |publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories |url=https://narac.llnl.gov/content/mods/publications/op-model-description-evaluation/UCRL-TM-222788.pdf |accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref> Chemical properties of the elements in the fallout control the rate at which they are deposited on the ground. Less volatile elements deposit first.\n\nSevere local fallout contamination can extend far beyond the blast and thermal effects, particularly in the case of high yield surface detonations. The ground track of fallout from an explosion depends on the weather from the time of detonation onwards. In stronger winds, fallout travels faster but takes the same time to descend, so although it covers a larger path, it is more spread out or diluted. Thus, the width of the fallout pattern for any given dose rate is reduced where the downwind distance is increased by higher winds. The total amount of activity deposited up to any given time is the same irrespective of the wind pattern, so overall casualty figures from fallout are generally independent of winds. But [[thunderstorm]]s can bring down activity as [[rain]] allows fallout to drop more rapidly, particularly if the [[mushroom cloud]] is low enough to be below (\"washout\"), or mixed with (\"rainout\"), the thunderstorm.\n\nWhenever individuals remain in a [[radioactive contamination|radiologically contaminated]] area, such contamination leads to an immediate external radiation exposure as well as a possible later internal hazard from inhalation and ingestion of radiocontaminants, such as the rather short-lived [[iodine-131]], which is accumulated in the [[thyroid]].\n\n==Factors affecting fallout==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:1957.JPG|right|300px|thumb|Nevada nuclear test total fallout outdoor gamma doses, 1950\u201357. The fallout is to the north and east because testing was only allowed when the wind was blowing in those directions.]] -->\n\n===Location===\nThere are two main considerations for the location of an explosion: height and surface composition. A nuclear weapon detonated in the air, called an [[air burst]], produces less fallout than a comparable explosion near the ground. A nuclear explosion in which the fireball touches the ground pulls soil and other materials into the cloud and neutron activates it before it falls back to the ground.  An air burst produces a relatively small amount of the highly radioactive heavy metal components of the device itself.\n\nIn case of water surface bursts, the particles tend to be rather lighter and smaller, producing less local fallout but extending over a greater area. The particles contain mostly [[sea salt]]s with some water; these can have a [[cloud seeding]] effect causing local [[rainout]] and areas of high local fallout. Fallout from a [[seawater]] burst is difficult to remove once it has soaked into [[porous]] surfaces because the fission products are present as metallic [[ion]]s that chemically bond to many surfaces. Water and detergent washing effectively removes less than 50% of this chemically bonded activity from [[concrete]] or [[steel]]. Complete decontamination requires aggressive treatment like [[sandblasting]], or acidic treatment. After the ''Crossroads'' underwater test, it was found that wet fallout must be immediately removed from ships by continuous water washdown (such as from the [[fire sprinkler]] system on the decks).\n\nParts of the sea bottom may become fallout. After the [[Castle Bravo]] test, white dust\u2014contaminated [[calcium oxide]] particles originating from pulverized and [[calcination|calcined]] [[coral]]s\u2014fell for several hours, causing [[beta burn]]s and radiation exposure to the inhabitants of the nearby atolls and the crew of the ''[[Daigo Fukury\u016b Maru]]'' fishing boat. The scientists called the fallout ''Bikini snow''.\n\nFor subsurface bursts, there is an additional phenomenon present called \"[[base surge]]\". The base surge is a cloud that rolls outward from the bottom of the subsiding column, which is caused by an excessive density of dust or water droplets in the air. For underwater bursts, the visible surge is, in effect, a cloud of liquid (usually water) droplets with the property of flowing almost as if it were a homogeneous fluid. After the water evaporates, an invisible base surge of small radioactive particles may persist.\n\nFor subsurface land bursts, the surge is made up of small solid particles, but it still behaves like a [[fluid]]. A soil earth medium favors base surge formation in an underground burst. Although the base surge typically contains only about 10% of the total bomb debris in a subsurface burst, it can create larger radiation doses than fallout near the detonation, because it arrives sooner than fallout, before much radioactive decay has occurred.\n\n===Meteorological===\n[[Image:Fallout G&D77.JPG|right|300px|thumb|Comparison of fallout gamma dose and dose rate contours for a 1 Mt fission land surface burst, based on DELFIC calculations. Because of radioactive decay, the dose rate contours contract after fallout has arrived, but dose contours continue to grow.]]\n\n[[Meteorology|Meteorological]] conditions greatly influence fallout, particularly local fallout. Atmospheric winds are able to bring fallout over large areas. For example, as a result of a ''[[Castle Bravo]]'' surface burst of a 15 Mt thermonuclear device at [[Bikini Atoll]] on March 1, 1954, a roughly cigar-shaped area of the [[Pacific]] extending over 500&nbsp;km downwind and varying in width to a maximum of 100&nbsp;km was severely contaminated. There are three very different versions of the fallout pattern from this test, because the fallout was only measured on a small number of widely spaced Pacific Atolls. The two alternative versions both ascribe the high radiation levels at north [[Rongelap]] to a downwind hotspot caused by the large amount of radioactivity carried on fallout particles of about 50\u2013100 micrometres size.<ref>{{cite journal|publisher=General Electric Company|editor=Howard A.

In other 1954 tests, including ''Yankee'' and ''Nectar,'' hotspots were mapped out by ships with submersible probes, and similar hotspots occurred in 1956 tests such as ''Zuni'' and ''Tewa''.\n<ref>{{cite journal|publisher=US Naval Radiological Defense Laboratory|author=Project Officer T.

Under special meteorological conditions, such as a local rain shower that originates above the radioactive cloud, limited areas of heavy contamination just downwind of a nuclear blast may be formed.\n\n==Effects==\nA wide range of [[biological process|biological]] changes may follow the irradiation of animals. These vary from rapid death following high doses of penetrating whole-body radiation, to essentially normal lives for a variable period of time until the development of delayed radiation effects, in a portion of the exposed population, following low dose exposures.\n\nThe unit of actual ''exposure'' is the [[Roentgen (unit)|r\u00f6ntgen]], defined in [[ionisation]]s per unit volume of air. All ionisation based instruments (including [[geiger counter]]s and [[ionisation chamber]]s) measure exposure. However, effects depend on the energy per unit mass, not the exposure measured in air. A deposit of 1 joule per kilogram has the unit of 1 [[gray (unit)|gray]] (Gy). For 1 MeV energy gamma rays, an exposure of 1 r\u00f6ntgen in air produces a dose of about 0.01 gray (1 centigray, cGy) in water or surface tissue. Because of shielding by the tissue surrounding the bones, the [[bone marrow]] only receives about 0.67 cGy when the air exposure is 1 r\u00f6ntgen and the surface skin dose is 1 cGy. Some lower values reported for the amount of radiation that would kill 50% of personnel (the {{LD50}}) refer to bone marrow dose, which is only 67% of the air dose.\n\n===Short term===\n{{further|LD50|l1=LD<sub>50</sub>}}\n\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2008}}\n[[File:Fallout shelter sign on a building.JPG|thumb|[[Fallout shelter]] sign on a building in [[New York City]]]]\nThe dose that would be lethal to 50% of a population is a common parameter used to compare the effects of various fallout types or circumstances. Usually, the term is defined for a specific time, and limited to studies of acute lethality. The common time periods used are 30 days or less for most small laboratory animals and to 60 days for large animals and humans. The LD<Sub>50</Sub> figure assumes that the individuals did not receive other injuries or medical treatment.\n\nIn the 1950s, the LD<Sub>50</Sub> for gamma rays was set at 3.5 Gy, while under more dire conditions of war (a bad diet, little medical care, poor nursing) the LD<Sub>50</Sub> was 2.5 Gy (250 rad). There have been few documented cases of survival beyond 6 Gy. One person at [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] survived a dose of more than 10 Gy, but many of the persons exposed there were not uniformly exposed over their entire body. If a person is exposed in a non-homogeneous manner then a given dose (averaged over the entire body) is less likely to be lethal. For instance, if a person gets a hand/low arm dose of 100 Gy, which gives them an overall dose of 4 Gy, they are more likely to survive than a person who gets a 4 Gy dose over their entire body. A hand dose of 10 Gy or more would likely result in loss of the hand. A [[United Kingdom|British]] industrial [[radiographer]] who was estimated to have received a hand dose of 100 Gy over the course of his lifetime lost his hand because of [[radiation dermatitis]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://oem.bmj.com/content/51/10/713.full.pdf|title=Death of a classified worker probably caused by overexposure to gamma radiation|journal=British Medical Journal|year=1994|volume=54|pages=713\u2013718}}</ref>  Most people become ill after an exposure to 1 Gy or more.

Most areas become fairly safe for travel and decontamination after three to five weeks.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Nature of Radioactive Fallout and Its Effects on Man: Hearings Before the Special Subcommittee on Radiation of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, Congress of the United States, Eighty-fifth Congress, First Session|last=Joint Committee on Atomic Energy|first=US Congress|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|year=1957|isbn=|location=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cveGUvsA4kIC&pg=PA1351&lpg=PA1351&dq=nuclear+fallout+tropospheric,+of+1+to+30+days&source=bl&ots=6h_O01pgYf&sig=ACfU3U2J2DG9LVO8Hpl4WOvlMg_IxMmreg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiMntT-pfjmAhVnQkEAHYstDloQ6AEwEXoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=nuclear%20fallout%20tropospheric%2C%20of%201%20to%2030%20days&f=false|pages=1351}}</ref>\n\nFor [[nuclear weapon yield|yields]] of up to 10 [[kiloton|kt]], prompt radiation is the dominant producer of casualties on the battlefield. Humans receiving an acute incapacitating dose (30 Gy) have their performance degraded almost immediately and become ineffective within several hours. However, they do not die until five to six days after exposure, assuming they do not receive any other injuries. Individuals receiving less than a total of 1.5 Gy are not incapacitated. People receiving doses greater than 1.5 Gy become disabled, and some eventually die.\n\nA dose of 5.3 Gy to 8.3 Gy is considered lethal but not immediately incapacitating.

The team sent collection forms to schools in the [[St. Louis, Missouri]] area, hoping to gather 50,000 teeth each year.

Halving thicknesses of common materials include: 1&nbsp;cm (0.4&nbsp;inch) of lead, 6&nbsp;cm (2.4&nbsp;inches) of concrete, 9&nbsp;cm (3.6&nbsp;inches) of packed earth or 150&nbsp;m (500&nbsp;ft) of air. When multiple thicknesses are built, the shielding is additive. A practical fallout shield is ten halving-thicknesses of a given material, such as 90&nbsp;cm (36&nbsp;inches) of packed earth, which reduces gamma ray exposure by approximately 1024 times (2<sup>10</sup>).<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.derose.net/steve/guides/emergency/hardened.html|title=Halving-thickness for various materials|publisher=The Compass DeRose Guide to Emergency Preparedness \u2013 Hardened Shelters}}</ref><ref name=NWSS2>{{cite book|last=Kearny|first=Cresson H|title=Nuclear War Survival Skills|year=1986|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|location=Oak Ridge, TN|isbn=978-0-942487-01-5|pages=11\u201320|url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p912.htm}}</ref> A shelter built with these materials for the purposes of fallout protection is known as a [[fallout shelter]].\n\n===Personal protective equipment===\nAs the nuclear energy sector continues to grow, the international rhetoric surrounding nuclear warfare intensifies, and the ever-present threat of radioactive materials falling into the hands of dangerous people persists, many scientists are working hard to find the best way to protect human organs from the harmful effects of high energy radiation. [[Acute radiation syndrome|Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS)]] is the most immediate risk to humans when exposed to [[ionizing radiation]] in dosages greater than around 0.1 [[Gray (unit)|Gy/hr]]. Radiation in the low energy spectrum ([[Alpha Radiation|alpha]] and [[Beta Radiation|beta radiation]]) with minimal penetrating power is unlikely to cause significant damage to internal organs. The high penetrating power of [[Gamma Radiation|gamma]] and [[neutron radiation]], however, easily penetrates the skin and many thin shielding mechanisms to cause cellular degeneration in the stem cells found in bone marrow. While full body shielding in a secure fallout shelter as described above is the most optimal form of radiation protection, it requires being locked in a very thick bunker for a significant amount of time. In the event of a nuclear catastrophe of any kind, it is imperative to have [[Radiation protection#Externally Penetrating Radiation Protective Equipment|mobile protection equipment]] for medical and security personnel to perform necessary containment, evacuation, and any number of other important public safety objectives. The mass of the shielding material required to properly protect the entire body from high energy radiation would make functional movement essentially impossible. This has led scientists to begin researching the idea of partial body protection: a strategy inspired by [[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)]]. The idea is to use enough shielding material to sufficiently protect the high concentration of bone marrow in the pelvic region, which contains enough regenerative stem cells to repopulate the body with unaffected bone marrow.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Waterman|first=Gideon|last2=Kase|first2=Kenneth|last3=Orion|first3=Itzhak|last4=Broisman|first4=Andrey|last5=Milstein|first5=Oren|date=29 March 2017|title=Selective Shielding of Bone Marrow: An Approach to Protecting Humans from External Gamma Radiation|journal=The Radiation Safety Journal: Health Physics|volume=113|issue=3|pages=195\u2013208|doi=10.1097/HP.0000000000000688|pmid=28749810}}</ref> More information on bone marrow shielding can be found in the [https://journals.lww.com/health-physics/pages/default.aspx Health Physics Radiation Safety Journal] article [https://journals.lww.com/health-physics/Abstract/2017/09000/Selective_Shielding_of_Bone_Marrow___An_Approach.4.aspx Selective Shielding of Bone Marrow: An Approach to Protecting Humans from External Gamma Radiation], or in the [[OECD|Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)]] and the [[Nuclear Energy Agency|Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA)]]'s 2015 report: [https://www.oecd-nea.org/rp/docs/2014/crpph-r2014-5.pdf Occupational Radiation Protection in Severe Accident Management.]\n\n===The Seven Ten Rule===\nThe danger of radiation from fallout also decreases rapidly with time due in large part to the exponential decay of the individual radionuclides.

Kearny presents data showing that for the first few days after the explosion, the radiation dose rate is reduced by a factor of ten for every seven-fold increase in the number of hours since the explosion.  He presents data showing that \"it takes about seven times as long for the dose rate to decay from 1000 roentgens per hour (1000 R/hr) to 10 R/hr (48 hours) as to decay from 1000 R/hr to 100 R/hr (7 hours).\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kearny |first1=Cresson H |title=Nuclear War Survival Skills |date=1986 |publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory |location=Oak Ridge, TN |isbn=978-0-942487-01-5 |pages=11\u201320 |url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p912.htm}}</ref>  This is a fairly rough rule of thumb based on observed data, not a precise relation.\n\n===Government Guides to Fallout Protection in the 1960s===\nThe United States government, often the [[Office of Civil Defense]] in the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], provided guides to fallout protection in the 1960s, frequently in the form of booklets.

A significant amount of materials of this type are necessary to protect a person from fallout radiation, so safety clothing cannot protect a person from fallout radiation.<ref name=\"protection2\" /><ref name=\"protection\" /> However, protective clothing can keep fallout particles off a person's body, but the radiation from these particles will still permeate through the clothing. For safety clothing to be able to block the fallout radiation, it would have to be so thick and heavy that a person could not function.<ref name=\"protection\" />\n\nThese guides indicated that [[fallout shelters]] should contain enough resources to keep its occupants alive for up to two weeks.<ref name=\"protection\" /> Community shelters were preferred over single-family shelters. The more people in a shelter, the greater quantity and variety of resources that shelter would be equipped with. These communities\u2019 shelters would also help facilitate efforts to recuperate the community in the future.<ref name=\"protection\" /> Single family shelters should be built below ground if possible. Many different types of [[fallout shelters]] could be made for a relatively small amount of money.<ref name=\"protection\" /><ref name=\"protection2\" /> A common format for [[fallout shelters]] was to build the shelter underground, with solid concrete blocks to act as the roof. If a shelter could only be partially underground, it was recommended to mound over that shelter with as much dirt as possible. If a house had a basement, it is best for a [[fallout shelter]] to be constructed in a corner of the basement.<ref name=\"protection\" /> The center of a basement is where the most radiation will be because the easiest way for radiation to enter a basement is from the floor above.<ref name=\"protection2\" /> The two of the walls of the shelter in a basement corner will be the basement walls that are surrounded by dirt outside. Cinder blocks filled with sand or dirt were highly recommended for the other two walls.<ref name=\"protection2\" /> Concrete blocks, or some other dense material, should be used as a roof for a basement fallout shelter because the floor of a house is not an adequate roof for a [[fallout shelter]].<ref name=\"protection2\" /> These shelters should contain water, food, tools, and a method for dealing with human waste.<ref name=\"protection2\" />\n\nIf a person did not have a shelter previously built, these guides recommended trying to get underground. If a person had a basement but no shelter, they should put food, water, and a waste container in the corner of the basement.<ref name=\"protection2\" /> Then items such as furniture should be piled up to create walls around the person in the corner.<ref name=\"protection2\" /> The more things a person can surround themselves with the better. If the underground cannot be reached, a tall apartment building at least ten miles from the blast was recommended as a good fallout shelter. People in these buildings should get as close to the center of the building as possible and avoid the top and ground floors.<ref name=\"protection\" /> Once again, people should surround themselves with whatever they can find and acquire whatever resources they can to create a barrier between themselves and fallout particles and radiation.\n\nDuring this time, schools were a favorable place to act as a [[fallout shelter]] according to the [[Office of Civil Defense]].<ref name=\"school3\" /><ref name=\"school1\" /> For starters, schools, not including universities, contained one-quarter of the population of the United States when they were in session at that time.<ref name=\"school1\" /> Schools distribution across the nation reflected the density of the population and were often a best building in a community to act as a fallout shelter. Also, schools also already had organization with leaders set in place.<ref name=\"school1\" /><ref name=\"school1\" /> The [[Office of Civil Defense]] recommended altering current schools and the construction of future schools to include thicker walls and roofs, better protected electrical systems, a purifying ventilation system, and a protected water pump.<ref name=\"school3\" /> The [[Office of Civil Defense]] determined 10 square feet of net area per person were necessary in schools that were to function as a fallout shelter. A normal classroom could provide 180 people with area to sleep.<ref name=\"school1\" /> If an attack were to happen, all the unnecessary furniture was to be moved out of the classrooms to make more room for people.<ref name=\"school1\" /> It was recommended to keep one or two tables in the room if possible to use as a food serving station.<ref name=\"school1\" />\n\nThe [[Office of Civil Defense]] conducted four case studies to find the cost of turning four standing schools into fallout shelters and what their capacity would be. The cost of the schools per occupant in the 1960s were $66.00, $127.00, $50.00, and $180.00.<ref name=\"school1\" /> The capacity of people these schools could house as shelters were 735, 511, 484, and 460 respectively.<ref name=\"school1\" />\n\n==Nuclear reactor accident==\n{{See also|Comparison of Chernobyl and other radioactivity releases}}\nFallout can also refer to [[nuclear accident]]s, although a [[nuclear reactor]] does not explode like a nuclear weapon. The [[isotopic signature]] of bomb fallout is very different from the fallout from a serious power reactor accident (such as [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] or [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents|Fukushima]]).\n\nThe key differences are in [[volatility (chemistry)|volatility]] and [[half-life]].\n\n===Volatility===\nThe [[boiling point]] of an [[chemical element|element]] (or its [[chemical compound|compound]]s) is able to control the percentage of that element a power reactor accident releases. The ability of an element to form a solid controls the rate it is deposited on the ground after having been injected into the atmosphere by a nuclear detonation or accident.\n\n===Half-life===\nA [[half life]] is the time it takes half of the radiation of a specific substance to decay. A large amount of short-lived isotopes such as <sup>97</sup>Zr are present in bomb fallout. This isotope and other short-lived isotopes are constantly generated in a power reactor, but because the [[critical mass|criticality]] occurs over a long length of time, the majority of these short lived isotopes decay before they can be released.\n\n===Preventative measures===\nNuclear fallout can occur due to a number of different sources. One of the most common potential sources of nuclear fallout is that of [[nuclear reactors]]. Because of this, steps must be taken to ensure the risk of nuclear fallout at nuclear reactors is controlled. \nIn the 1950s and 60's, the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC) began developing safety regulations against nuclear fallout for civilian nuclear reactors. Because the effects of nuclear fallout are more widespread and longer lasting than other forms of energy production accidents, the AEC desired a more proactive response towards potential accidents than ever before.<ref name=\"Uncertainty 846\u2013884\">{{cite journal |last1=Wellock |first1=Thomas |title=Engineering Uncertainty and Bureaucratic Crisis at the Atomic Energy Commission |journal=Technology and Culture |date=October 2012 |volume=53 |issue=4 |pages=846\u2013884|doi=10.1353/tech.2012.0144 }}</ref> One step to prevent nuclear reactor accidents was the [[Price-Anderson Act]]. Passed by Congress in 1957, the Price-Anderson Act ensured government assistance above the $60 million covered by private insurance companies in the case of a nuclear reactor accident. The main goal of the Price-Anderson Act was to protect the multibillion-dollar companies overseeing the production of nuclear reactors. Without this protection, the nuclear reactor industry could potentially come to a halt, and the protective measures against nuclear fallout would be reduced.<ref name=\"Probabilistic 920\u2013941\">{{cite journal |last1=Carlisle |first1=Rodney |title=Probabilistic Risk Assessment in Nuclear Reactors: Engineering Success, Public Relation Failure |journal=Technology and Culture |date=October 1997 |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=920\u2013941|doi=10.2307/3106954 |jstor=3106954 }}</ref> However, because of the limited experience in nuclear reactor technology, engineers had a difficult time calculating the potential risk of released radiation.<ref name=\"Probabilistic 920\u2013941\"/> Engineers were forced to imagine every unlikely accident, and the potential fallout associated with each accident. The AEC's regulations against potential nuclear reactor fallout were centered on the ability of the power plant to the Maximum Credible Accident, or MCA. The MCA involved a \"large release of radioactive isotopes after a substantial meltdown of the reactor fuel when the reactor coolant system failed through a Loss-of-Coolant Accident\".<ref name=\"Uncertainty 846\u2013884\"/> The prevention of the MCA enabled a number of new nuclear fallout preventative measures. Static safety systems, or systems without power sources or user input, were enabled to prevent potential human error. Containment buildings, for example, were reliably effective at containing a release of radiation and did not need to be powered or turned on to operate. Active protective systems, although far less dependable, can do many things that static systems cannot. For example, a system to replace the escaping steam of a cooling system with cooling water could prevent reactor fuel from melting. However, this system would need a sensor to detect the presence of releasing steam. Sensors can fail, and the results of a lack of preventative measures would result in a local nuclear fallout. The AEC had to choose, then, between active and static systems to protect the public from nuclear fallout. With a lack of set standards and probabilistic calculations, the AEC and the industry became divided on the best safety precautions to use. \nThis division gave rise to the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]], or NRC. The NRC was committed to 'regulations through research', which gave the regulatory committee a knowledge bank of research on which to draw their regulations. Much of the research done by the NRC sought to move safety systems from a deterministic viewpoint into a new probabilistic approach. The deterministic approach sought to foresee all problems before they arose. The probabilistic approach uses a more mathematical approach to weigh the risks of potential radiation leaks. Much of the probabilistic safety approach can be drawn from the [[radiative transfer]] theory in [[Physics]], which describes how radiation travels in free space and through barriers.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Shore |first1=Steven |title=Blue Sky and Hot Piles: The Evolution of Radiative Transfer Theory from Atmospheres to Nuclear Reactors |journal=Historia Mathematica |date=2002 |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=463\u2013489 |doi=10.1006/hmat.2002.2360|doi-access=free }}</ref> Today, the NRC is still the leading regulatory committee on nuclear reactor power plants.\n\n== Determining extent of nuclear fallout ==\nThe [[International Nuclear Event Scale|International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale]] (INES) is the primary form of categorizing the potential health and environmental effects of a nuclear or radiological event and communicating it to the public.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.iaea.org/topics/emergency-preparedness-and-response-epr/international-nuclear-radiological-event-scale-ines|title=International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale (INES)|date=2017-11-22|website=www.iaea.org|access-date=2019-04-19}}</ref> The scale, which was developed in 1990 by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] and the Nuclear Energy Agency of the [[OECD|Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development]], classifies these nuclear accidents based off the potential impact of the fallout:<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/ines.pdf|title=INES: The International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale|website=The International Atomic Energy Agency}}</ref>\n\n* Defence-in-Depth: This is the lowest form of nuclear accidents and refers to events that have no direct impact on people or the environment but must be taken note of to improve future safety measures. \n* Radiological Barriers and Control: This category refers to events that have no direct impact on people or the environment and only refer to the damage caused within major facilities.\n* People and the Environment: This section of the scale consists of more serious nuclear accidents.

However, without a proper policing force, the guidelines set forth by the IAEA were often treated lightly or ignored completely. In 1986, the disaster at [[Chernobyl]] was evidence that international nuclear reactor safety was not to be taken lightly. Even in the midst of the [[Cold War]], the Nuclear Regulatory Commission sought to improve the safety of Soviet nuclear reactors. As noted by IAEA Director General [[Hans Blix]], \"A radiation cloud doesn't know international boundaries.\"<ref name=\"Children 3\u201332\">{{cite journal |last1=Wellock |first1=Thomas |title=The Children of Chernobyl: Engineers and the Campaign for Safety |journal=History and Technology |date=2013 |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=3\u201332 |doi=10.1080/07341512.2013.785719 }}</ref> The NRC showed the Soviets the safety guidelines used in the US: capable regulation, safety-minded operations, and effective plant designs. The soviets, however, had their own priority: keeping the plant running at all costs. In the end, the same shift between deterministic safety designs to probabilistic safety designs prevailed. In 1989, the [[World Association of Nuclear Operators]] (WANO) was formed to cooperate with the IAEA to ensure the same three pillars of reactor safety across international borders. In 1991, WANO concluded (using a probabilistic safety approach) that all former communist-controlled nuclear reactors could not be trusted, and should be closed. Compared to a \"Nuclear [[Marshall Plan]]\", efforts were taken throughout the 1990s and 2000s to ensure international standards of safety for all nuclear reactors.<ref name=\"Children 3\u201332\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Dirty bomb]]\n* [[Nuclear terrorism]]\n* ''[[Fallout: An American Nuclear Tragedy]]''\n* ''[[Fallout Protection]]''\u2014U.S. government booklet\n* [[Effects of nuclear explosions]]\n* [[Fallout (RT\u00c9 drama)|''Fallout'' (RT\u00c9 drama)]]\u2014Irish drama exploring scenarios following a nuclear accident at [[Sellafield]].\n* [[Fallout (series)]]\n* [[Fallout shelter]]\n* [[Fission product]]\n* [[Hot Particle]]\n* [[Human radiation experiments]]\n* [[List of nuclear accidents]]\n* [[Lists of nuclear disasters and radioactive incidents]]\n* [[Neutron bomb]]\n* [[Mutation breeding#Radiation breeding]]\n* [[Nuclear terrorism]]\n* ''[[Nuclear war survival skills]]'' by [[Cresson Kearny]]\n* [[Nuclear weapon design]]\n* [[Potassium iodide]]\n* [[Project GABRIEL]]\n* ''[[Protect and Survive]]'', a series of booklets and a [[public information film]] series produced for the British government in the 1970s and 1980s.\n* [[Radioactive contamination]]\n* [[Radiation poisoning]]\n* [[Radiation biology]]\n* [[Radioactive waste]]\n* [[Radiological weapon]]\n* [[Joseph Rotblat]]\n* [[Salted bomb]] \n* ''[[Survival Under Atomic Attack]]'', an official U.S. government booklet regarding the effects of a nuclear attack.\n* [[Nuclear fallout effects on an ecosystem]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Glasstone, Samuel and Dolan, Philip J., ''The Effects of Nuclear Weapons (third edition)'', U.S. Government Printing Office, 1977.
