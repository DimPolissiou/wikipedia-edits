He was the fourth son of [[William the Conqueror]] and was educated in [[Latin]] and the [[Liberal arts education|liberal arts]]. On William's death in 1087, Henry's elder brothers [[Robert Curthose]] and [[William II of England|William Rufus]] inherited [[Duchy of Normandy|Normandy]] and England, respectively, but Henry was left landless. He purchased the County of [[Cotentin Peninsula|Cotentin]] in western Normandy from Robert, but his brothers deposed him in 1091. He gradually rebuilt his power base in the Cotentin and allied himself with William against Robert. \n\nPresent at the place where his brother William died in a hunting accident in 1100, Henry seized the English throne, promising at his coronation to correct many of William's less popular policies. He married [[Matilda of Scotland]] and they had two surviving children, [[William Adelin]] and [[Empress Matilda]]; he also had many illegitimate children by his many mistresses. Robert, who invaded in 1101, disputed Henry's control of England; this military campaign ended in a negotiated settlement that confirmed Henry as king. The peace was short-lived, and Henry invaded the Duchy of Normandy in 1105 and 1106, finally defeating Robert at the [[Battle of Tinchebray]]. Henry kept Robert imprisoned for the rest of his life. Henry's control of Normandy was challenged by [[Louis VI of France]], [[Baldwin VII, Count of Flanders|Baldwin VII of Flanders]] and [[Fulk, King of Jerusalem|Fulk V of Anjou]], who promoted the rival claims of Robert's son, [[William Clito]], and supported a major rebellion in the Duchy between 1116 and 1119. Following Henry's victory at the [[Battle of Br\u00e9mule]], a favourable peace settlement was agreed with Louis in 1120.\n\nConsidered by contemporaries to be a harsh but effective ruler, Henry skilfully manipulated the barons in England and Normandy. In England, he drew on the existing [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] system of justice, local government and taxation, but also strengthened it with additional institutions, including the royal [[exchequer]] and itinerant [[Judge|justices]]. Normandy was also governed through a growing system of justices and an exchequer. Many of the officials who ran Henry's system were \"new men\" of obscure backgrounds rather than from families of high status, who rose through the ranks as administrators. Henry encouraged [[Gregorian Reform|ecclesiastical reform]], but became embroiled in a serious dispute in 1101 with Archbishop [[Anselm of Canterbury]], which was resolved through a compromise solution in 1105. He supported the [[Cluniac Reforms|Cluniac]] order and played a major role in the selection of the senior clergy in England and Normandy.\n\nHenry's son William drowned in the ''[[White Ship]]'' disaster of 1120, throwing the royal succession into doubt. Henry took a second wife, [[Adeliza of Louvain]], in the hope of having another son, but their marriage was childless. In response to this, he declared his daughter Matilda his heir and married her to [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou|Geoffrey of Anjou]]. The relationship between Henry and the couple became strained, and fighting broke out along the border with Anjou. Henry died on 1 December 1135 after a week of illness. Despite his plans for Matilda, the King was succeeded by his nephew, [[Stephen, King of England|Stephen of Blois]], resulting in a period of civil war known as [[the Anarchy]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Early life, 1068\u20131099==\n===Childhood and appearance, 1068\u201386===\nHenry was probably born in England in 1068, in either the summer or the last weeks of the year, possibly in the town of [[Selby]] in [[Yorkshire]].<ref name=HollisterGreenP20>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|pp=30\u201331}}; {{harvnb|Green|2009|p=20}}</ref>{{refn|The dating of Henry's birth depends on comparing chronicler accounts and the various travels of his parents William and Matilda; these give only limited periods in which Henry could have been conceived and born.

He was the fourth son of [[William the Conqueror]] and was educated in [[Latin]] and the [[Liberal arts education|liberal arts]]. On William's death in 1087, Henry's elder brothers [[Robert Curthose]] and [[William II of England|William Rufus]] inherited [[Duchy of Normandy|Normandy]] and England, respectively, but Henry was left landless. He purchased the County of [[Cotentin Peninsula|Cotentin]] in western Normandy from Robert, but his brothers deposed him in 1091. He gradually rebuilt his power base in the Cotentin and allied himself with William against Robert. \n\nPresent at the place where his brother William died in a hunting accident in 1100, Henry seized the English throne, promising at his coronation to correct many of William's less popular policies. He married [[Matilda of Scotland]] and they had two surviving children, [[William Adelin]] and [[Empress Matilda]]; he also had many illegitimate children by his many mistresses. Robert, who invaded in 1101, disputed Henry's control of England; this military campaign ended in a negotiated settlement that confirmed Henry as king. The peace was short-lived, and Henry invaded the Duchy of Normandy in 1105 and 1106, finally defeating Robert at the [[Battle of Tinchebray]]. Henry kept Robert imprisoned for the rest of his life. Henry's control of Normandy was challenged by [[Louis VI of France]], [[Baldwin VII, Count of Flanders|Baldwin VII of Flanders]] and [[Fulk, King of Jerusalem|Fulk V of Anjou]], who promoted the rival claims of Robert's son, [[William Clito]], and supported a major rebellion in the Duchy between 1116 and 1119. Following Henry's victory at the [[Battle of Br\u00e9mule]], a favourable peace settlement was agreed with Louis in 1120.\n\nConsidered by contemporaries to be a harsh but effective ruler, Henry skilfully manipulated the barons in England and Normandy. In England, he drew on the existing [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] system of justice, local government and taxation, but also strengthened it with additional institutions, including the royal [[exchequer]] and itinerant [[Judge|justices]]. Normandy was also governed through a growing system of justices and an exchequer. Many of the officials who ran Henry's system were \"new men\" of obscure backgrounds rather than from families of high status, who rose through the ranks as administrators. Henry encouraged [[Gregorian Reform|ecclesiastical reform]], but became embroiled in a serious dispute in 1101 with Archbishop [[Anselm of Canterbury]], which was resolved through a compromise solution in 1105. He supported the [[Cluniac Reforms|Cluniac]] order and played a major role in the selection of the senior clergy in England and Normandy.\n\nHenry's son William drowned in the ''[[White Ship]]'' disaster of 1120, throwing the royal succession into doubt. Henry took a second wife, [[Adeliza of Louvain]], in the hope of having another son, but their marriage was childless. In response to this, he declared his daughter Matilda his heir and married her to [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou|Geoffrey of Anjou]]. The relationship between Henry and the couple became strained, and fighting broke out along the border with Anjou. Henry died on 1 December 1135 after a week of illness. Despite his plans for Matilda, the King was succeeded by his nephew, [[Stephen, King of England|Stephen of Blois]], resulting in a period of civil war known as [[the Anarchy]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Early life, 1068\u20131099==\n===Childhood and appearance, 1068\u201386===\nHenry was probably born in England in 1068, in either the summer or the last weeks of the year, possibly in the town of [[Selby]] in [[Yorkshire]].<ref name=HollisterGreenP20>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|pp=30\u201331}}; {{harvnb|Green|2009|p=20}}</ref>{{refn|The dating of Henry's birth depends on comparing chronicler accounts and the various travels of his parents William and Matilda; these give only limited periods in which Henry could have been conceived and born.
