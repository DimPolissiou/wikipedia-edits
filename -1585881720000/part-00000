Faker always loved [[puzzle]]s and [[video game]]s, often playing custom maps for ''[[Warcraft III]]'' and the MOBA ''Chaos'' during his teenage years. He discovered ''[[League of Legends]]'' in late 2011, and quickly became adept at the game. He attended [[:ko:\ub9c8\ud3ec\uace0\ub4f1\ud559\uad50|Mapo High School]], the same high school that [[Deft (video game player)|Deft]] of [[DragonX]] attended,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sports.news.naver.com/esports/news/read.nhn?oid=442&aid=0000102585|title=[\uae30\ud68d \uc601\uc0c1] \ucda9\uaca9 \uc2e4\ud654!

SKT T1 K dominated the Korean scene and in October 2013 Faker led them to win their first [[League of Legends World Championship|''League of Legends'' World Championship]]. Later in the HOT6iX Champions Summer 2013, Faker cemented his status as a brilliant player due to his perfect outplay against [[KT Rolster]] Bullets mid laner Yoo \"Ryu\" Sang-wook, which would then become one of the most iconic moments in ''League of Legends'' history.\n\n=== Season 4 ===\nIn 2014, SK Telecom T1 K followed their success through in the OGN winter season, making the entire run without dropping a single game. They would then go on to win All-Star Paris 2014. However, their Winter season success did not follow through and during the Spring and Summer seasons, SKT T1 K failed to qualify for the [[2014 League of Legends World Championship|2014 World Championship]]. In the following offseason, [[Riot Games]] changed the team regulations so that each organisation can only have one team participating in each league. This led to the merger of SKT T1 K and SKT T1 S, and the subsequent departures of [[Impact (video game player)|Impact]] and [[Piglet (video game player)|Piglet]] for the [[NA LCS]]. The new team would compete under the name SKT T1.\n\n=== Season 5 ===\nBetween Seasons 4 and 5, many top Korean ''League of Legends'' players, including the entire world champion team, [[Samsung Galaxy (esports)|Samsung Galaxy]], left Korea to play on Chinese teams for higher salaries. Faker on the other hand, declined an offer of over $1,000,000 by a Chinese team, preferring to stay in Korea on SKT. In November 2014 it was reported that Faker had declined contract offers from several Chinese companies including one offer of [[South Korean won|\u20a9]]500 million ($425,403 USD) for streaming.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ongamers.com/articles/faker-reportedly-declined-contracts-valued-up-to-1/1100-2322/|title=Faker reportedly declined contracts valued up to $1 million in total by Chinese companies.|first=Nilu |last=Kulasingham|website=OnGamers|accessdate=April 7, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThroughout 2015, Faker shared the mid lane position with Lee \"Easyhoon\" Ji-hoon. Depending on the team composition SKT wanted to play, either one of the players could be substituted into the game. Faker had many notable performances in the [[League of Legends Champions Korea|LCK]] such as a pentakill against NaJin e-mFire with his LeBlanc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/esports/faker-opens-lck-season/|title=Faker gets benched, comes back with a pentakill|first=Samuel|last=Lingle|website=[[The Daily Dot]]|date=January 7, 2015|access-date=October 22, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006041137/http://www.dailydot.com/esports/faker-opens-lck-season/|archive-date=October 6, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> SKT ended the summer split in first place and advanced to the world championship.\n\nAt the [[2015 League of Legends World Championship|2015 World Championship]], Faker and his team won while only dropping one game in the finals for a record of 15\u20131 throughout the series.<ref>https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CV1drzCUsAEe8GB.jpg:large</ref>\n\n=== Season 6 ===\nFaker and his team started off the 2016 Season by winning the LCK Spring Split. With this victory, SKT was guaranteed a spot in the [[2016 Mid-Season Invitational]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lolesports.com/en_US/msi/msi_2016/about/|title=About Mid-Season Invitational|website=LoL eSports|accessdate=June 21, 2016}}</ref> At that point in time, MSI was the only major international tournament they had yet to win. They were heavily favored coming into the tournament, but were initially unable to perform up to their usual standards, unexpectedly losing several games in the group stage. However, they managed to turn things around during the elimination round and eventually clinched the title by sweeping the North American team, [[Counter Logic Gaming]], in the finals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lolesports.com/en_US/articles/koreas-sktelecom-t1-wins-2016-mid-season-invitational|title=Korea's SKTelecom T1 wins the 2016 Mid-Season Invitational|first=Paul|last=Marshall|website=LoL eSports|date=May 15, 2016|accessdate=June 21, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn July 11, 2016, Faker became the first player to reach 1,000 kills in the LCK.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.akshonesports.com/article/2016/07/faker-sets-a-new-record-1000-kills-in-the-lck-interview-translated|title=Faker Sets A New Record - 1,000 Kills In the LCK - Interview Translated|website=Akshon Esports|access-date=July 9, 2019}}</ref> His 1,000th kill was on MVP Beyond's Reksai, which he achieved on Malzahar.\n\nSKT placed third in the [[2016 Summer League of Legends Champions Korea|2016 LCK Summer Split]], but still qualified for the [[2016 League of Legends World Championship|2016 World Championship]] through circuit points. The team swept through the group stage and advanced towards the playoff round. In the semifinals they defeated the [[ROX Tigers]] in a close 3\u20132 series. In the finals they defeated Samsung Galaxy in another close 3\u20132 series, winning their third world championship title.

After a dominant group stage conceding just a single loss, SKT narrowly defeated [[Misfits Gaming|Misfits]] and [[Royal Never Give Up]] in the quarterfinals and semifinals respectively, before having to face Samsung Galaxy in a repeat of the previous year's final. SKT's fate was sealed after Faker was caught by a flash Varus ult move by Samsung's AD carry Ruler, resulting in Samsung Galaxy clean sweeping SKT 3\u20130, ending the SKT domination at the World Championship. Faker himself was shown to be visibly upset after the loss, and had to be consoled by his teammates to shake the Samsung Galaxy players' hands post-game. However, this caught the attention of many ''League of Legends'' fans throughout the world, with much support and many tributes being given to the team's legacy and Faker for his continued success.\n\n=== Season 8 ===\nFaker played his 402th match in the LCK on July 17, 2018.

He and his brother were raised by their grandparents and their father, Lee Kyung-joon, in [[Gangseo District, Seoul]]. Faker always loved [[puzzle]]s and [[video game]]s, often playing custom maps for ''[[Warcraft III]]'' and the MOBA ''Chaos'' during his teenage years. He discovered ''[[League of Legends]]'' in late 2011, and quickly became adept at the game. He attended [[:ko:\ub9c8\ud3ec\uace0\ub4f1\ud559\uad50|Mapo High School]], the same high school that [[Deft (video game player)|Deft]] of [[DragonX]] attended,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sports.news.naver.com/esports/news/read.nhn?oid=442&aid=0000102585|title=[\uae30\ud68d \uc601\uc0c1] \ucda9\uaca9 \uc2e4\ud654!

SKT T1 K dominated the Korean scene and in October 2013 Faker led them to win their first [[League of Legends World Championship|''League of Legends'' World Championship]]. Later in the HOT6iX Champions Summer 2013, Faker cemented his status as a brilliant player due to his perfect outplay against [[KT Rolster]] Bullets mid laner Yoo \"Ryu\" Sang-wook, which would then become one of the most iconic moments in ''League of Legends'' history.\n\n=== Season 4 ===\nIn 2014, SK Telecom T1 K followed their success through in the OGN winter season, making the entire run without dropping a single game. They would then go on to win All-Star Paris 2014. However, their Winter season success did not follow through and during the Spring and Summer seasons, SKT T1 K failed to qualify for the [[2014 League of Legends World Championship|2014 World Championship]]. In the following offseason, [[Riot Games]] changed the team regulations so that each organisation can only have one team participating in each league. This led to the merger of SKT T1 K and SKT T1 S, and the subsequent departures of [[Impact (video game player)|Impact]] and [[Piglet (video game player)|Piglet]] for the [[NA LCS]]. The new team would compete under the name SKT T1.\n\n=== Season 5 ===\nBetween Seasons 4 and 5, many top Korean ''League of Legends'' players, including the entire world champion team, [[Samsung Galaxy (esports)|Samsung Galaxy]], left Korea to play on Chinese teams for higher salaries. Faker on the other hand, declined an offer of over $1,000,000 by a Chinese team, preferring to stay in Korea on SKT. In November 2014 it was reported that Faker had declined contract offers from several Chinese companies including one offer of [[South Korean won|\u20a9]]500 million ($425,403 USD) for streaming.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ongamers.com/articles/faker-reportedly-declined-contracts-valued-up-to-1/1100-2322/|title=Faker reportedly declined contracts valued up to $1 million in total by Chinese companies.|first=Nilu |last=Kulasingham|website=OnGamers|accessdate=April 7, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThroughout 2015, Faker shared the mid lane position with Lee \"Easyhoon\" Ji-hoon. Depending on the team composition SKT wanted to play, either one of the players could be substituted into the game. Faker had many notable performances in the [[League of Legends Champions Korea|LCK]] such as a pentakill against NaJin e-mFire with his LeBlanc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/esports/faker-opens-lck-season/|title=Faker gets benched, comes back with a pentakill|first=Samuel|last=Lingle|website=[[The Daily Dot]]|date=January 7, 2015|access-date=October 22, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006041137/http://www.dailydot.com/esports/faker-opens-lck-season/|archive-date=October 6, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> SKT ended the summer split in first place and advanced to the world championship.\n\nAt the [[2015 League of Legends World Championship|2015 World Championship]], Faker and his team won while only dropping one game in the finals for a record of 15\u20131 throughout the series.<ref>https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CV1drzCUsAEe8GB.jpg:large</ref>\n\n=== Season 6 ===\nFaker and his team started off the 2016 Season by winning the LCK Spring Split. With this victory, SKT was guaranteed a spot in the [[2016 Mid-Season Invitational]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lolesports.com/en_US/msi/msi_2016/about/|title=About Mid-Season Invitational|website=LoL eSports|accessdate=June 21, 2016}}</ref> At that point in time, MSI was the only major international tournament they had yet to win. They were heavily favored coming into the tournament, but were initially unable to perform up to their usual standards, unexpectedly losing several games in the group stage. However, they managed to turn things around during the elimination round and eventually clinched the title by sweeping the North American team, [[Counter Logic Gaming]], in the finals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lolesports.com/en_US/articles/koreas-sktelecom-t1-wins-2016-mid-season-invitational|title=Korea's SKTelecom T1 wins the 2016 Mid-Season Invitational|first=Paul|last=Marshall|website=LoL eSports|date=May 15, 2016|accessdate=June 21, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn July 11, 2016, Faker became the first player to reach 1,000 kills in the LCK.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.akshonesports.com/article/2016/07/faker-sets-a-new-record-1000-kills-in-the-lck-interview-translated|title=Faker Sets A New Record - 1,000 Kills In the LCK - Interview Translated|website=Akshon Esports|access-date=July 9, 2019}}</ref> His 1,000th kill was on MVP Beyond's Reksai, which he achieved on Malzahar.\n\nSKT placed third in the [[2016 Summer League of Legends Champions Korea|2016 LCK Summer Split]], but still qualified for the [[2016 League of Legends World Championship|2016 World Championship]] through circuit points. The team swept through the group stage and advanced towards the playoff round. In the semifinals they defeated the [[ROX Tigers]] in a close 3\u20132 series. In the finals they defeated Samsung Galaxy in another close 3\u20132 series, winning their third world championship title.

After a dominant group stage conceding just a single loss, SKT narrowly defeated [[Misfits Gaming|Misfits]] and [[Royal Never Give Up]] in the quarterfinals and semifinals respectively, before having to face Samsung Galaxy in a repeat of the previous year's final. SKT's fate was sealed after Faker was caught by a flash Varus ult move by Samsung's AD carry Ruler, resulting in Samsung Galaxy clean sweeping SKT 3\u20130, ending the SKT domination at the World Championship. Faker himself was shown to be visibly upset after the loss, and had to be consoled by his teammates to shake the Samsung Galaxy players' hands post-game. However, this caught the attention of many ''League of Legends'' fans throughout the world, with much support and many tributes being given to the team's legacy and Faker for his continued success.\n\n=== Season 8 ===\nFaker played his 400th match in the LCK on July 17, 2018.

In modern [[Slovak language|Slovak]] and [[Czech language|Czech]] the form is ''Vy\u0161ehrad''.\n\nThe castle of Visegr\u00e1d is called ''Fellegv\u00e1r'' (Citadel) in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]],<ref name=\"Papp\">Antal Papp: Magyarorsz\u00e1g (Hungary), Panor\u00e1ma, Budapest, 1982, {{ISBN|963 243 241 X}}, p. 860, pp. 229-236</ref> In [[German language|German]], the town is called ''Plintenburg''.\n\nOther places with names that are the same or similar include [[Vi\u0161egrad]], a town in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]; [[Vyshhorod]], a city in [[Ukraine]] adjacent to [[Kiev]]; [[Wyszogr\u00f3d]], a city in [[Poland]]; the [[Vy\u0161ehrad]] castle in [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]]; and Vy\u0161ehrad, a location with a nature reserve near [[Jasenovo, Slovakia|Jasenovo]] in [[Slovakia]].\n\n==History==\nVisegr\u00e1d was first mentioned in 1009 as a county town and the chief town of an [[archdeacon]]ry. After the destructive [[Mongol invasion of Europe]] in 1242, the town was rebuilt in a slightly different location to the south. King [[Charles I of Hungary]] made Visegr\u00e1d, his hometown, the royal seat of Hungary in 1325. At the same time, his diplomat [[Stephen S\u00e1f\u00e1r]] was appointed [[castellan]].\n\nIn 1335, Charles hosted at Visegr\u00e1d a [[Congress of Visegr\u00e1d (1335)|two-month congress]] with the [[Bohemia]]n king, [[John of Luxembourg]], and the [[Kingdom of Poland (1320\u20131385)|Polish]] king, [[Casimir III of Poland|Casimir III]]. It was crucial in creating a peace between the three kingdoms and securing an alliance between Poland and Hungary against [[Habsburg]] [[Austria]]. [[Congress of Visegr\u00e1d (1339)|Another congress]] followed in 1338.\n\n[[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and King of Hungary and [[Croatia]] in personal union with Hungary, moved the royal seat to [[Buda]] between 1405 and 1408. King [[Matthias Corvinus of Hungary|Matthias Corvinus]]  (1443\u20131490), King of Hungary,  used Visegr\u00e1d as a country residence.\n\nVisegr\u00e1d lost importance after the partition of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] following the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]] in 1526.\n\nIn 1991, the leading politicians of [[Hungary]], [[Czechoslovakia]], and [[Poland]] met here to form a periodical forum, the [[Visegr\u00e1d group]], with an intentional allusion to the meeting centuries earlier in 1335.\n\nVisegr\u00e1d was granted [[town privileges]] again in 2000.\n\n==Monuments==\n[[File:Visegr\u00e1d Mountain Fastness 01.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Visegr\u00e1d Castle]]\n[[File:Visegrad 1480 korul.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The castle at the time of [[King Matthias]]' reign]]\n[[File:Vicegrad - Peeters Jacob - 1686.jpg|250px|thumb|Visegr\u00e1d in 1686 by [[Jacob Balthasar Peeters]]]]\n\n===Upper Castle===\nAfter the Mongol invasion, King [[B\u00e9la IV of Hungary]] and his wife had a new fortification system constructed in the 1240-50s near the one destroyed earlier. The first part of the new system was the Upper Castle on top of a high hill. The castle was laid out on a triangular ground plan and had three towers at its corners. In the 14th century, at the time of the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin]] kings of Hungary, the castle became a royal residence and was enlarged with a new curtain wall and palace buildings.\n\nAround 1400 King [[Sigismund of Luxembourg|Sigismund]] had a third curtain wall constructed and enlarged the palace buildings. At the end of the 15th century, King [[Matthias Corvinus of Hungary|Matthias Corvinus]] had the interior renovated. The Upper Castle also served for the safekeeping of the Hungarian [[Regalia|royal insignia]] between the 14th century and 1526. In 1544 Visegr\u00e1d was occupied by the [[Ottoman Empire]], and, apart from a short period in 1595-1605, it remained in [[Ottoman Turks|Turkish]] hands until 1685. The castle was seriously damaged by the Turks and was never used afterwards.\n\nThe castle is now open to the public to visit.\n\n===Lower Castle===\nThe Lower Castle is the part of the fortification system that connects the Upper Castle with the [[Danube]]. In its centre rises the Solomon Tower, a large, hexagonal residential tower dating from the 13th century. In the 14th century, new curtain walls were built around the tower. During a Turkish raid in 1544, the southern part of the tower collapsed. Its renovation began only in the 1870s and was finished in the 1960s.\n\nAt present, the Tower houses exhibitions installed by the King Matthias Museum (M\u00e1ty\u00e1s Kir\u00e1ly M\u00fazeum) of Visegr\u00e1d. The exhibitions present the reconstructed Gothic fountains from the Royal Palace, Renaissance sculpture in Visegr\u00e1d, and the history of Visegr\u00e1d.\n\n===Royal Palace===\nThe first royal house on this site was built by King [[Charles I of Hungary]] after 1325. In the second half of the 14th century, this was enlarged into a palace by his son, King [[Louis I of Hungary]].\n\nIn the last third of the 14th century, King Louis and his successor Sigismund of Luxembourg had the majority of the earlier buildings dismantled and created a new, sumptuous palace complex, the extensive ruins of which are still visible today. The palace complex was laid out on a square ground plan measuring 123 x 123 m. A garden adjoined to it from the north and a [[Franciscan]] friary, founded by King Sigismund in 1424, from the south. In the time of Louis I and Sigismund, the palace was the official residence of the kings of Hungary until about 1405-08.\n\nBetween 1477 and 1484 Matthias Corvinus had the palace complex reconstructed in late [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]]. The [[Italian Renaissance]] [[Renaissance architecture|architectural style]] was used for decoration, the first time the style appeared in Europe outside [[Italy]]. After the Ottoman Turks' siege in 1544, the palace fell into ruins. By the 18th century it was completely covered by earth. Its excavation began in 1934 and continues today.\n\nThe reconstructed royal residence building is open to the public and houses exhibitions on the history of the palace and reconstructed historical interiors.\n\n=== Sibrik Hill ===\nThe ruins of this military camp can be seen outside Visegr\u00e1d, to the north, on a hill that overlooks the [[Danube]]. The camp has a triangular ground plan. It was built in the first half of the 4th century as one of the important fortifications along the [[Limes (Roman Empire)|limes]], the frontier of the [[Roman Empire]]. Its [[praetorium]] (the commander's building) was constructed at the end of the 4th century. In the early 5th century, the Roman army abandoned the military camp.\n\nIn the 10th and 11th centuries, the fortification, rebuilt as a [[castle]], became a regional centre of the recently formed Hungarian state. \"Visegr\u00e1d\" appears for the first time as the name of this regional centre (1009). The fortification was finally destroyed in 1242 by the [[Mongol invasion of Europe]].\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n<gallery mode=packed heights=200>\nImage:Kastell Visegr\u00e1d\u2013Sibrik \u2013 S\u00fcdmauer.jpg|Sibrik Hill\nImage:K\u00f6nigsschlo\u00df4 - M\u00e1ty\u00e1s Kir\u00e1ly M\u00fazeum (K\u00f6nig-Matthias-Museum), Visegr\u00e1d.jpg|Royal Palace, Matthias fountain (15th century)\nImage:Kir\u00e1lyi palota maradv\u00e1nyai (7594. sz\u00e1m\u00fa m\u0171eml\u00e9k) 3.jpg|Garden of the Royal Palace\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Visegr\u00e1d Group]]\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n{{Wikivoyage|Visegr\u00e1d}}\n*[http://www.visegrad.hu/en Visegr\u00e1d home page]\n*[http://www.terkepcentrum.hu/index.asp?go=map&tid=28413 Street map] {{in lang|hu}}\n*[http://www.civertan.hu/legifoto/legifoto.php?page_level=836&pageNum_images=1 Aerial photography: Visegr\u00e1d] {{in lang|hu}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Historical capitals of Hungary}}\n{{Pest County}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Visegrad}}\n[[Category:Populated places in Pest County]]\n[[Category:Romanesque architecture in Hungary]]\n[[Category:Castles in Hungary]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Pest County]]\n[[Category:Museums in Pest County]]\n[[Category:Historic house museums in Hungary]]\n[[Category:Former capitals of Hungary]]\n[[Category:Royal residences in Hungary]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|a place in Hungary|the political alliance|Visegr\u00e1d Group|other similarly-named places|Visegrad (disambiguation)}}\n{{Infobox settlement <!--more fields are available for this Infobox--See Template:Infobox Settlement-->\n| official_name          = Visegr\u00e1d\n| other_name             = {{lang|la|Pone Navata / Altum Castrum}} {{in lang|la}} <br>{{lang|de|Plintenburg}} {{in lang|de}} <br>{{lang|sk|Vy\u0161ehrad}} {{in lang|sk|cs}}\n | image_skyline = {{Photomontage\n  | photo1a = Fellegv\u00e1r (7612. sz\u00e1m\u00fa m\u0171eml\u00e9k) 6.jpg{{!}}The city in the Danube Bend\n  | photo2a = Kir\u00e1lyi palota maradv\u00e1nyai (7594. sz\u00e1m\u00fa m\u0171eml\u00e9k) 6.jpg{{!}}Royal Palace\n  | photo2b = Fellegv\u00e1r (7612. sz\u00e1m\u00fa m\u0171eml\u00e9k) 2.jpg{{!}}Gate of the Citadel\n  | spacing = 2\n  | position = center\n  | color_border = white\n  | color = white\n  | size = 266\n  | foot_montage         = Descending, from top: the city in the [[Danube Bend]], ruins of the Royal Palace, gate of the Citadel}}\n | image_shield          = HUN Visegr\u00e1d C\u00edmer.svg\n| image_flag             = Flag of Visegr\u00e1d.svg\n| subdivision_type       = [[Countries of the world|Country]]\n| subdivision_name       = {{HUN}}\n| timezone               = [[Central European Time|CET]]\n| utc_offset             = +1\n| timezone_DST           = [[Central European Summer Time|CEST]]\n| utc_offset_DST         = +2\n| pushpin_map            = Hungary\n| pushpin_label_position = <!-- the position of the pushpin label: left, right, top, bottom, none -->\n| pushpin_map_caption    = Location of Visegr\u00e1d\n| pushpin_mapsize        = \n| subdivision_type1      = [[Counties of Hungary|County]]\n| subdivision_name1      = [[Pest county|Pest]]\n| area_total_km2         = 33.27\n| population_total       = 1840<ref>[http://www.ksh.hu/apps/hntr.telepules?p_lang=EN&p_id=28413 Visegr\u00e1d, KSH]</ref>\n| population_as_of       = 2017\n| population_density_km2 = auto\n| postal_code_type       = [[Postal code]]\n| postal_code            = 2025\n| area_code              = 26\n| coordinates            = {{coord|47.78483|18.97367|region:HU|display=inline,title}}\n}}\n\n'''Visegr\u00e1d''' ({{IPA-hu|\u02c8vi\u0283\u025b\u0261ra\u02d0d}}) is a small [[castle town]] in [[Pest (county)|Pest County]], [[Hungary]].
