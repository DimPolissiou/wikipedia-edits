(season 2)|second season]] of the television series ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''<ref name=\"InhumansAoS\" /> By August 2014, the studio was ready to move forward in development with the film, with a screenplay written by Joe Robert Cole.<ref name=\"Inhumans2\" /> In October 2014, the film was announced for Phase Three<ref name=\"Oct2014Event\" /> and scheduled for release July 2019.<ref name=\"Feb2015Dates\" /> By October 2015, Cole was no longer involved with the film and any potential drafts that he may have written would not be used.<ref name=\"ColeNo\" /> In April 2016, ''Inhumans'' was removed from the release schedule,<ref name=\"InhumansNoReleaseDate\" /> and would no longer be a part of Phase Three.<ref name=\"InhumansNoPhase3\" /> In July 2016, Feige said ''Inhumans'' would \"certainly\" be a part of the discussion regarding the film ideas for 2020 and 2021,<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" /> adding the following November that he was still optimistic the film could be released in Phase Four.<ref name=\"FeigeInhumansNov2016\" /> In November 2016, Marvel Television announced the series ''[[Inhumans (TV series)|Marvel's Inhumans]]'', which premiered on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in September 2017, after [[Inhumans premiere|the first two episodes]] were screened in [[IMAX]].<ref name=\"InhumansTVSeries\" /> The series was not intended to be a reworking of the film.<ref name=\"InhumansTVSeries2\" /> ABC canceled ''Inhumans'' after one season in May 2018.<ref name=\"InhumansCanceled\" />\n*{{anchor|Runaways}} '''''Runaways''''': A film based on the ''[[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]]'' went through a number of iterations. [[Brian K. Vaughan]] was originally hired to write a screenplay based on the property in May 2008.<ref name=\"RunawaysMay2008\" /> In April 2010, Marvel hired [[Peter Sollett]] to direct the film,<ref name=\"SollettRunaways\" /> and Drew Pearce was hired to write a script in May.<ref name=\"PearceRunaways\" /> The following October, development on the film was put on hold,<ref name=\"RunawaysHold\" /> with Pearce revealing in September 2013 that the ''Runaways'' film had been shelved in favor of ''The Avengers'', with the earliest it could release being Phase Three.<ref name=\"PearceRunaways2\" /> In October 2014, after announcing all of Marvel's Phase Three films without ''Runaways'', Feige stated the project was \"still an awesome script that exists in our script vault\", adding, \"We'd love to do something with ''Runaways'' some day. In our television and future film discussions, it's always one that we talk about, because we have a solid draft there. But again, we can't make them all.\"<ref name=\"Oct2014EventQA\" /> In August 2016, [[Marvel Television]] announced ''[[Runaways (TV series)|Marvel's Runaways]]'' from the streaming service [[Hulu]],<ref name=\"RunawaysHuluOrder\" /> with the series receiving a full season order in May 2017.<ref name=\"RunawaysSeriesOrder\" /> It premiered in November 2017.<ref name=\"RunawaysPremiere\"

(season 2)|second season]] of the television series ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''<ref name=\"InhumansAoS\" /> By August 2014, the studio was ready to move forward in development with the film, with a screenplay written by Joe Robert Cole.<ref name=\"Inhumans2\" /> In October 2014, the film was announced for Phase Three<ref name=\"Oct2014Event\" /> and scheduled for release July 2019.<ref name=\"Feb2015Dates\" /> By October 2015, Cole was no longer involved with the film and any potential drafts that he may have written would not be used.<ref name=\"ColeNo\" /> In April 2016, ''Inhumans'' was removed from the release schedule,<ref name=\"InhumansNoReleaseDate\" /> and would no longer be a part of Phase Three.<ref name=\"InhumansNoPhase3\" /> In July 2016, Feige said ''Inhumans'' would \"certainly\" be a part of the discussion regarding the film ideas for 2020 and 2021,<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" /> adding the following November that he was still optimistic the film could be released in Phase Four.<ref name=\"FeigeInhumansNov2016\" /> In November 2016, Marvel Television announced the series ''[[Inhumans (TV series)|Marvel's Inhumans]]'', which premiered on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in September 2017, after [[Inhumans premiere|the first two episodes]] were screened in [[IMAX]].<ref name=\"InhumansTVSeries\" /> The series was not intended to be a reworking of the film.<ref name=\"InhumansTVSeries2\" /> ABC canceled ''Inhumans'' after one season in May 2018.<ref name=\"InhumansCanceled\" />\n*{{anchor|Runaways}} '''''Runaways''''': A film based on the ''[[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]]'' went through a number of iterations. [[Brian K. Vaughan]] was originally hired to write a screenplay based on the property in May 2008.<ref name=\"RunawaysMay2008\" /> In April 2010, Marvel hired [[Peter Sollett]] to direct the film,<ref name=\"SollettRunaways\" /> and Drew Pearce was hired to write a script in May.<ref name=\"PearceRunaways\" /> The following October, development on the film was put on hold,<ref name=\"RunawaysHold\" /> with Pearce revealing in September 2013 that the ''Runaways'' film had been shelved in favor of ''The Avengers'', with the earliest it could release being Phase Three.<ref name=\"PearceRunaways2\" /> In October 2014, after announcing all of Marvel's Phase Three films without ''Runaways'', Feige stated the project was \"still an awesome script that exists in our script vault\", adding, \"We'd love to do something with ''Runaways'' some day. In our television and future film discussions, it's always one that we talk about, because we have a solid draft there. But again, we can't make them all.\"<ref name=\"Oct2014EventQA\" /> In August 2016, [[Marvel Television]] announced ''[[Runaways (TV series)|Marvel's Runaways]]'' from the streaming service [[Hulu]],<ref name=\"RunawaysHuluOrder\" /> with the series receiving a full season order in May 2017.<ref name=\"RunawaysSeriesOrder\" /> It premiered in November 2017.<ref name=\"RunawaysPremiere\"

{"title_page": "List of governors of California", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n[[File:Gavin Newsom by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|[[Gavin Newsom]], the 40th and current Governor of California|upright]]\nThe [[governor of California]] is the chief executive of the [[California state government]], whose responsibilities include making annual [[State of the State address]]es to the [[California State Legislature]], submitting the budget, and ensuring that state laws are enforced. The governor is also the commander-in-chief of the [[U.S. state|state's]] [[California National Guard|military forces]].\n\nThe current governor is [[Gavin Newsom]], who has been in office since 2019.\n\nThirty-nine people have served as governor, over 40 distinct terms; many have been influential nationwide in areas far-flung from politics. [[Leland Stanford]] founded [[Stanford University]] in 1891. [[Earl Warren]], later [[Chief Justice of the United States]], won an election with the nominations of the three major parties \u2013 the only person ever to run essentially unopposed for governor of California. [[Ronald Reagan]], who was president of the [[Screen Actors Guild]] and later [[President of the United States]], and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] both came to prominence through acting. [[Gray Davis]], the 37th governor of California, was the second governor in [[United States|American]] history to be [[Recall election|recalled]] by voters. The shortest tenure was that of [[Milton Latham]], who served only five days before being elected by the legislature to fill a vacant [[United States Senate]] seat. The longest tenure is that of [[Jerry Brown|Edmund Gerald \"Jerry\" Brown Jr.]], who previously served as governor from 1975 to 1983 and again from 2011 to 2019. He is the son of former governor [[Pat Brown|Edmund Gerald \"Pat\" Brown Sr.]] who served from 1959 to 1967.\n\n==Governors==\n{{see also|List of Governors of California before 1850}}\nCalifornia was obtained by the [[United States]] in the [[Mexican Cession]] following the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. Unlike most other states, it was never organized as a territory, and was admitted as the 31st state on September 9, 1850.\n\nThe original [[California Constitution]] of 1849 called for elections every two years, with no set start date for the term. An amendment ratified in 1862 increased the term to four years,<ref name=\"const-amend1862\">{{cite book |last=Henning |first=W.F. |title=Constitution of the State of California |year=1899 |publisher=C.W.

This is well sourced, and it is unknown why the terms did not match the constitution, or why they began to match the constitution in 1939.}} In 1990, Proposition 140 led to a constitutional amendment<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lalaw.lib.ca.us/research/ballots/1990/1990.aspx |title=California Ballot Propositions 1990-1999 |accessdate=August 2, 2010 |publisher=Los Angeles County Law Library |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007124417/http://lalaw.lib.ca.us/research/ballots/1990/1990.aspx |archivedate=October  7, 2010 }}</ref> implementing a [[term limit]] of two terms;<ref>CA Const. art.

The governor is also the commander-in-chief of the [[U.S. state|state's]] [[California National Guard|military forces]].\n\nThe current governor is [[Gavin Newsom]], who has been in office since 2019.\n\nThirty-nine people have served as governor, over 40 distinct terms; many have been influential nationwide in areas far-flung from politics. [[Leland Stanford]] founded [[Stanford University]] in 1891. [[Earl Warren]], later [[Chief Justice of the United States]], won an election with the nominations of the three major parties \u2013 the only person ever to run essentially unopposed for governor of California. [[Ronald Reagan]], who was president of the [[Screen Actors Guild]] and later [[President of the United States]], and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] both came to prominence through acting. [[Gray Davis]], the 37th governor of California, was the second governor in [[United States|American]] history to be [[Recall election|recalled]] by voters. The shortest tenure was that of [[Milton Latham]], who served only five days before being elected by the legislature to fill a vacant [[United States Senate]] seat. The longest tenure is that of [[Jerry Brown|Edmund Gerald \"Jerry\" Brown Jr.]], who previously served as governor from 1975 to 1983 and again from 2011 to 2019. He is the son of former governor [[Pat Brown|Edmund Gerald \"Pat\" Brown Sr.]] who served from 1959 to 1967.\n\n==Governors==\n{{see also|List of Governors of California before 1850}}\nCalifornia was obtained by the [[United States]] in the [[Mexican Cession]] following the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. Unlike most other states, it was never organized as a territory, and was admitted as the 31st state on September 9, 1850.\n\nThe original [[California Constitution]] of 1849 called for elections every two years, with no set start date for the term. An amendment ratified in 1862 increased the term to four years,<ref name=\"const-amend1862\">{{cite book |last=Henning |first=W.F. |title=Constitution of the State of California |year=1899 |publisher=C.W.

For example, if one were to merely stay away from food, drink, or sexual activity without an intention to fast, then this fast is not valid and does not count.

DeMille]], his second [[film|picture]] to be filmed in color.  It is based on a serialized story written by [[Thelma Strabel]] in 1940 for ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''. The movie, released shortly after the United States' entry into [[World War II]], was a swashbuckling adventure set in the 1840s along the [[Florida]] coast, and was wildly successful.\n\nWhile he based his film on Strabel's story, DeMille took liberties with details such as sibling relationships and subplots, while staying true to the spirit of the story, which centers on a headstrong, independent woman portrayed by Paulette Goddard.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1840, Loxi Claiborne (Goddard) is running a [[marine salvage]] business started by her deceased father. A [[hurricane]] is passing through the [[Key West]] area, leaving behind at least one wreck on the nearby [[shoal]]s. The ''Jubilee'' founders, and Loxi and other salvagers race to claim the cargo. Not arriving first, Loxi and her crew rescue the captain, Jack Stuart (Wayne), but do not share in the salvage rights. Apparently, the first salvager on the scene, King Cutler ([[Raymond Massey]]), may have actually planned the wreck.\n[[File:Reap the Wild Wind trailer screenshot.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ray Milland]] and [[Paulette Goddard]]]]\nNursing Jack back to health, Loxi falls in love with him. When she visits [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] with her cousin Drusilla (Hayward), Loxi schemes to win a plum captain's position for Jack by seducing Steve Tolliver (Milland), who is running the [[sailing ship]] line for which Jack works. Steve falls for Loxi and returns with her to Key West to investigate the truth about Jack's shipwreck.\n\nDrusilla goes home to [[Havana]] when Loxi and Steve return to Key West. Steve has come to rid the [[Florida Keys|Keys]] of [[pirate]]s like Cutler (and to be near Loxi). Cutler, in turn, arranges to have Steve [[Shanghaiing|shanghaied]] by the crew of a [[whaler]]. Loxi hears of the plot and gets Jack to help her save Steve. Later, they discover that Steve has concealed Jack's appointment to the [[steamship]] ''Southern Cross'' on orders from his superior. Angry over a seemingly underhanded act, Jack meets with Cutler. He learns that Steve's boss has just died and that Steve will be taking over the [[shipping line]]. Jack realizes that he is unlikely to keep his command with Steve in charge and agrees to work with Cutler to sabotage his new ship; he sails to Havana to take command.\n[[File:John Wayne Reap The Wild Wind.jpg|left|thumb|John Wayne as Jack Stuart in<br> ''Reap the Wild Wind'' (1942)]]\nRumors circulate and prices of the cargo of the ''Southern Cross'' fluctuate wildly, leaving Steve to suspect a wreck is planned. He commandeers the ''Claiborne'' with Loxi on board and heads to Havana to stop Jack. Loxi, believing Jack is innocent, disables her ship, and they sit becalmed in a fog bank as the ''Southern Cross'' piles into a [[reef]] and sinks. Unknown to Jack, Drusilla had stowed away to be with her lover, King Cutler's brother Dan (Preston), and she drowned.\n\nJack is put on trial for wrecking his ship. The testimony reveals a woman may have been on board, though none was rescued. To determine if a woman is in the wreck, Steve agrees to [[Underwater diving|dive]] to the wreck with Jack. While down in the wreck, Jack and Steve discover proof that Drusilla was on board and has been drowned. They are attacked by a [[giant squid]].

DeMille]], his second [[film|picture]] to be filmed in color.  It is based on a serialized story written by [[Thelma Strabel]] in 1940 for ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''. The movie, released shortly after the United States' entry into [[World War II]], was a swashbuckling adventure set in the 1840s along the [[Florida]] coast, and was wildly successful.\n\nWhile he based his film on Strabel's story, DeMille took liberties with details such as sibling relationships and subplots, while staying true to the spirit of the story, which centers on a headstrong, independent woman portrayed by Paulette Goddard.\n\n==Plot==\nAs the film opens, Loxi Claiborne (Goddard) is running a [[marine salvage]] business started by her deceased father. A [[hurricane]] is passing through the [[Key West]] area, leaving behind at least one wreck on the nearby [[shoal]]s. The ''Jubilee'' founders, and Loxi and other salvagers race to claim the cargo. Not arriving first, Loxi and her crew rescue the captain, Jack Stuart (Wayne), but do not share in the salvage rights. Apparently, the first salvor on the scene, King Cutler ([[Raymond Massey]]), may have actually planned the wreck.\n[[File:Reap the Wild Wind trailer screenshot.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ray Milland]] and [[Paulette Goddard]]]]\nNursing Jack back to health, Loxi falls in love with him. When she visits [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] with her cousin Drusilla (Hayward), Loxi schemes to win a plum captain's position for Jack by seducing Steve Tolliver (Milland), who is running the [[sailing ship]] line for which Jack works. Steve falls for Loxi and returns with her to Key West to investigate the truth about Jack's shipwreck.\n\nDrusilla goes home to [[Havana]] when Loxi and Steve return to Key West. Steve has come to rid the [[Florida Keys|Keys]] of [[pirate]]s like Cutler (and to be near Loxi). Cutler, in turn, arranges to have Steve [[Shanghaiing|shanghaied]] by the crew of a [[whaler]]. Loxi hears of the plot and gets Jack to help her save Steve. Later, they discover that Steve has concealed Jack's appointment to the [[steamship]] ''Southern Cross'' on orders from his superior. Angry over a seemingly underhanded act, Jack meets with Cutler. He learns that Steve's boss has just died and that Steve will be taking over the [[shipping line]]. Jack realizes that he is unlikely to keep his command with Steve in charge and agrees to work with Cutler to sabotage his new ship; he sails to Havana to take command.\n[[File:John Wayne Reap The Wild Wind.jpg|left|thumb|John Wayne as Jack Stuart in<br> ''Reap the Wild Wind'' (1942)]]\nRumors circulate and prices of the cargo of the ''Southern Cross'' fluctuate wildly, leaving Steve to suspect a wreck is planned. He commandeers the ''Claiborne'' with Loxi on board and heads to Havana to stop Jack. Loxi, believing Jack is innocent, disables her ship, and they sit becalmed in a fog bank as the ''Southern Cross'' piles into a [[reef]] and sinks. Unknown to Jack, Drusilla had stowed away to be with her lover, King Cutler's brother Dan (Preston), and she drowned.\n\nJack is put on trial for wrecking his ship. The testimony reveals a woman may have been on board, though none was rescued. To determine if a woman is in the wreck, Steve agrees to [[Underwater diving|dive]] to the wreck with Jack. While down in the wreck, Jack and Steve discover proof that Drusilla was on board and has been drowned. They are attacked by a [[giant squid]]. Jack saves Steve's life, but is lost when the ''Southern Cross'' slips off the [[continental shelf]] into deep water. Dan Cutler accuses his brother of murder and is shot dead by him, whereupon, Steve shoots King Cutler, killing him.\n\nLoxi and Steve return to Charleston together.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ray Milland]] as Steven Tolliver\n* [[John Wayne]] as Jack Stuart\n* [[Paulette Goddard]] as Loxi Claiborne\n* [[Raymond Massey]] as King Cutler\n* [[Robert Preston (actor)|Robert Preston]] as Dan Cutler\n* [[Lynne Overman]] as Captain Philpott\n* [[Susan Hayward]] as Drusilla Alston\n* [[Milburn Stone]] as Lieutenant Farragut \n* [[Charles Bickford]] as Bully Brown\n* [[Walter Hampden]] as Commodore Devereaux\n* [[Louise Beavers]] as Maum Maria, the Claiborne Maid\n* [[Martha O'Driscoll]] as Ivy Devereaux\n* [[Elisabeth Risdon]] as Mrs. Claiborne\n* [[Hedda Hopper]] as Aunt Henrietta Beresford\n* [[Victor Kilian]] as Mathias Widgeon\n* [[Oscar Polk]] as Salt Meat\n* [[Raymond Hatton]] as Master Shipwright \n* [[Lane Chandler]] as Sam \n* [[William 'Wee Willie' Davis]] as The Lamb\n* [[Ben Carter (actor)|Ben Carter]] as Chinkapin\n* [[Janet Beecher]] as Mrs. Mottram \n* Dave Wengren as 'Claiborne' Lookout \n* Davison Clark as Judge Marvin \n* Louis Merrill as Captain of the 'Pelican'\n* [[Frank M.
