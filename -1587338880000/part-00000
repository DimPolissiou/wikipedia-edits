Sports]] (Yahoo!).\n\nCurrently, the NCAA compiles consensus all-America teams in the sports of [[NCAA Division I#Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I-FBS]] football and Division I men's basketball using a point system computed from All-America teams named by coaches associations or media sources.  The system consists of three points for a first-team honor, two points for second-team honor, and one point for third-team honor.  Honorable mention and fourth team or lower recognitions are not accorded any points.  Football consensus teams are compiled by position and the player accumulating the most points at each position is named first team consensus all-American.  Currently, the NCAA recognizes All-Americans selected by the '''AP, AFCA, FWAA, ''TSN'', and the WCFF''' to determine Consensus and Unanimous All-Americans. Any player named to the First Team by all five of the NCAA-recognized selectors is deemed a Unanimous All-American.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/resources/stats/statistics+policies |title=2010-11 NCAA Statistics Policies(updated 9/15/2010) |accessdate=December 10, 2011 |archivedate=December 10, 2011 |date=September 15, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63plxMYlJ?url=http://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/resources/stats/statistics+policies |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[http://www.sportingnews.com/ca/ncaa-football/news/alabamas-tua-tagovailoa-2018-consensus-all-american-team/u4gei2bnxvig1jmptsbwhsj97 2018 Consensus All-America Team]</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"0\" \n|-\n!

Sports]] (Yahoo!).\n\nCurrently, the NCAA compiles consensus all-America teams in the sports of [[NCAA Division I#Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I-FBS]] football and Division I men's basketball using a point system computed from All-America teams named by coaches associations or media sources.  The system consists of three points for a first-team honor, two points for second-team honor, and one point for third-team honor.  Honorable mention and fourth team or lower recognitions are not accorded any points.  Football consensus teams are compiled by position and the player accumulating the most points at each position is named first team consensus all-American.  Currently, the NCAA recognizes All-Americans selected by the '''AP, AFCA, FWAA, ''TSN'', and the WCFF''' to determine Consensus and Unanimous All-Americans. Any player named to the First Team by all five of the NCAA-recognized selectors is deemed a Unanimous All-American.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/resources/stats/statistics+policies |title=2010-11 NCAA Statistics Policies(updated 9/15/2010) |accessdate=December 10, 2011 |archivedate=December 10, 2011 |date=September 15, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63plxMYlJ?url=http://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/resources/stats/statistics+policies |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[http://www.sportingnews.com/ca/ncaa-football/news/alabamas-tua-tagovailoa-2018-consensus-all-american-team/u4gei2bnxvig1jmptsbwhsj97 2018 Consensus All-America Team]</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"0\" \n|-\n!

[[Carncastle#Knockdhu|Knockdhu]], north of Larne, was the site of a [[Bronze Age]] [[promontory fort]] and settlement. The early coastal dwellers are thought to have had a sophisticated culture which involved trading between the shores of the North Channel and between other settlements on the coasts of Scotland. The coast of Scotland is in fact clearly visible from here. Archaeological digs in the area have found [[flint]]work and other artefacts which have been assigned dates from 6000 BC onwards. The term ''Larnian'' has even been coined by archaeologists to describe such flintworks and similar artefacts of the [[Mesolithic]] era (and one time to describe Mesolithic culture in Ireland as a whole).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.larne.gov.uk/template1.asp?pid=596&area=6&text=1|title=Larne Borough council \u2013 Local History and Heritage|publisher=|accessdate=16 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408120840/http://www.larne.gov.uk/template1.asp?pid=596&area=6&text=1|archive-date=8 April 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/larnian|title=Answers \u2013 The Most Trusted Place for Answering Life's Questions|publisher=|accessdate=16 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/330673/Larnian-industry|title=Larnian industry \u2013 ancient culture|publisher=|accessdate=16 April 2017}}</ref> Larnian is also currently used to refer to people from Larne.\n\nLarne takes its name from ''Latharna'', a [[Gaelic Ireland|Gaelic]] territory or ''[[t\u00faath]]'' that was part of the [[Ulaid]] minor-kingdom of ''[[D\u00e1l nAraidi]]''.<ref name=\"MacCotter229-30\"/> The name spelt as ''Latharne'' was used at one point in reference to the Anglo-Norman [[cantred]] of [[Carrickfergus]].<ref name=\"MacCotter229-30\"/> ''Latharna'' itself means \"descendants of [[Lathar]]\", with Lathar according to legend being a son of the pre-Christian king [[\u00dagaine M\u00f3r]].<ref name=\"PlacenamesLarne\"/> The town sprang up where the River Inver flows into Larne Lough.

In 1315 [[Edward the Bruce]] of Scotland (brother of [[Robert the Bruce]], King of Scotland) landed at Larne with his 6000 strong army en route to conquer Ireland, where [[Olderfleet Castle]] was of strategic importance. Edward saw Ireland as another front in the ongoing war against Norman England.\n\nIn 1569 [[Queen Elizabeth I]], Queen of England and Ireland, appointed [[Moyses Hill|Sir Moyses Hill]] as the governor of Olderfleet Castle. It was seen as strategically important for any [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|Tudor conquest of Ulster]]. Following the 17th century [[Union of the Crowns]] of Scotland, England and Ireland under [[James VI & I]] many more settlers would have arrived to Ulster via Larne during the [[Plantation of Ulster]]. The area around County Antrim itself, however, was not part of the official 17th century Plantation; instead many Scottish settlers arrived in the area through private settlement in the 17th century (as they had also been doing for centuries before).\n\nDuring the 18th century many [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] emigrated to America from the port of Larne. A monument in the Curran Park commemorates the ''Friends Goodwill'', the first emigrant ship to sail from Larne in May 1717, heading for Boston, Massachusetts in the [[New England]] region of the modern United States of America. Boston's long standing [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] roots can be traced to Larne. The town is documented as being the first in county Antrim to be taken by United Irishmen during the ill-fated [[rebellion of 1798]].  The Protestant rebels from this area (almost entirely Presbyterian) filled Larne and engaged the government forces around 2am on the morning of the 7th of June.  This surprise attack drove the garrison to flee the town, at which point the rebel force marched off to join up with [[Henry Joy McCracken|McCracken]] and fight in the [[Battle of Antrim]].<ref>Hope, J., & Newsinger, J.

Gardenmore is one of three Presbyterian Churches in the town of Larne. Although Presbyterians have been in Larne since the early 1600s, nothing is known about the origins of the congregation, although the church is believed to have been in existence for some years prior to the building of a meeting-house in 1769.\n* Larne Baptist Church\n* Larne Congregational Church. This church was founded in 1879 by Rev James Orr, but nothing is recorded about other founding members and nothing is known about Rev Orr except that his time as minister lasted for six years until 1885 and that he had died before February 1910 when the new church was built at 38\u201340 Curran road. Before this there was an old tin/iron building on the Clonlee which was the original meeting place. It was known as the tin tabernacle. After it became unusable due to rust and decay, the church members met at 139 Main street in the town and some meetings were held in Rev Archibald Mackinlay's home at 20 Clonlee. Around this time (1900 approx) monthly meetings were being held in the Intermediate school at Barnhill. This school was actually the end house in the terrace beside the Orange hall and is now a house again.\n* Larne Elim Pentecostal\n* Larne Free Presbyterian Church\n* Larne Methodist Church. This church is one of three on the Larne Circuit. The other Churches on the circuit are Craigyhill and Carnlough Methodist Churches. The Methodist Church in Larne has maintained a presence in the town ever since visits from the founder of the Methodist Church Rev John Wesley. Methodism seeks to be \"a friend to all and an enemy to none\" and this is what the Larne circuit has tried to achieve through many years of ministry. The Methodist Church throughout the circuit is involved in many community and ecumenical organisations throughout the town. The previous Superintendent the Rev Andrew Kingston was always in awe of the great relationship this group built up between the churches in Larne.\n* Larne Seventh-Day Adventist Church\n* Old Presbyterian Church of Larne and Kilwaughter\n* St. Anthony's Church\n* St. Cedma's Parish Church.

[[Carncastle#Knockdhu|Knockdhu]], north of Larne, was the site of a [[Bronze Age]] [[promontory fort]] and settlement. The early coastal dwellers are thought to have had a sophisticated culture which involved trading between the shores of the North Channel and between other settlements on the coasts of Scotland. The coast of Scotland is in fact clearly visible from here. Archaeological digs in the area have found [[flint]]work and other artefacts which have been assigned dates from 6000 BC onwards. The term ''Larnian'' has even been coined by archaeologists to describe such flintworks and similar artefacts of the [[Mesolithic]] era (and one time to describe Mesolithic culture in Ireland as a whole).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.larne.gov.uk/template1.asp?pid=596&area=6&text=1|title=Larne Borough council \u2013 Local History and Heritage|publisher=|accessdate=16 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408120840/http://www.larne.gov.uk/template1.asp?pid=596&area=6&text=1|archive-date=8 April 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/larnian|title=Answers \u2013 The Most Trusted Place for Answering Life's Questions|publisher=|accessdate=16 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/330673/Larnian-industry|title=Larnian industry \u2013 ancient culture|publisher=|accessdate=16 April 2017}}</ref> Larnian is also currently used to refer to people from Larne.\n\nLarne takes its name from ''Latharna'', a [[Gaelic Ireland|Gaelic]] territory or ''[[t\u00faath]]'' that was part of the [[Ulaid]] minor-kingdom of ''[[D\u00e1l nAraidi]]''.<ref name=\"MacCotter229-30\"/> The name spelt as ''Latharne'' was used at one point in reference to the Anglo-Norman [[cantred]] of [[Carrickfergus]].<ref name=\"MacCotter229-30\"/> ''Latharna'' itself means \"descendants of [[Lathar]]\", with Lathar according to legend being a son of the pre-Christian king [[\u00dagaine M\u00f3r]].<ref name=\"PlacenamesLarne\"/> The town sprang up where the River Inver flows into Larne Lough.

In 1315 [[Edward the Bruce]] of Scotland (brother of [[Robert the Bruce]], King of Scotland) landed at Larne with his 6000 strong army en route to conquer Ireland, where [[Olderfleet Castle]] was of strategic importance. Edward saw Ireland as another front in the ongoing war against Norman England.\n\nIn 1569 [[Queen Elizabeth I]], Queen of England and Ireland, appointed [[Moyses Hill|Sir Moyses Hill]] as the governor of Olderfleet Castle. It was seen as strategically important for any [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|Tudor conquest of Ulster]]. Following the 17th century [[Union of the Crowns]] of Scotland, England and Ireland under [[James VI & I]] many more settlers would have arrived to Ulster via Larne during the [[Plantation of Ulster]]. The area around County Antrim itself, however, was not part of the official 17th century Plantation; instead many Scottish settlers arrived in the area through private settlement in the 17th century (as they had also been doing for centuries before).\n\nDuring the 18th century many [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] emigrated to America from the port of Larne. A monument in the Curran Park commemorates the ''Friends Goodwill'', the first emigrant ship to sail from Larne in May 1717, heading for Boston, Massachusetts in the [[New England]] region of the modern United States of America. Boston's long standing [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] roots can be traced to Larne. The town is documented as being the first in county Antrim to be taken by United Irishmen during the ill-fated [[rebellion of 1798]].  The Protestant rebels from this area (almost entirely Presbyterian) filled Larne and engaged the government forces around 2am on the morning of the 7th of June.  This surprise attack drove the garrison to flee the town, at which point the rebel force marched off to join up with [[Henry Joy McCracken|McCracken]] and fight in the [[Battle of Antrim]].<ref>Hope, J., & Newsinger, J.

Gardenmore is one of three Presbyterian Churches in the town of Larne. Although Presbyterians have been in Larne since the early 1600s, nothing is known about the origins of the congregation, although the church is believed to have been in existence for some years prior to the building of a meeting-house in 1769.\n* Larne Baptist Church\n* Larne Congregational Church. This church was founded in 1879 by Rev James Orr, but nothing is recorded about other founding members and nothing is known about Rev Orr except that his time as minister lasted for six years until 1885 and that he had died before February 1910 when the new church was built at 38\u201340 Curran road. Before this there was an old tin/iron building on the Clonlee which was the original meeting place. It was known as the tin tabernacle. After it became unusable due to rust and decay, the church members met at 139 Main street in the town and some meetings were held in Rev Archibald Mackinlay's home at 20 Clonlee. Around this time (1900 approx) monthly meetings were being held in the Intermediate school at Barnhill. This school was actually the end house in the terrace beside the Orange hall and is now a house again.\n* Larne Elim Pentecostal\n* Larne Free Presbyterian Church\n* Larne Methodist Church. This church is one of three on the Larne Circuit. The other Churches on the circuit are Craigyhill and Carnlough Methodist Churches. The Methodist Church in Larne has maintained a presence in the town ever since visits from the founder of the Methodist Church Rev John Wesley.

Most composite armours are lighter than their all-metal equivalent, but instead occupy a larger volume for the same resistance to penetration. It is possible to design composite armour stronger, lighter and less voluminous than traditional armour, but the cost is often prohibitively high, restricting its use to especially vulnerable parts of a vehicle. Its primary purpose is to help defeat [[high explosive anti-tank]] (HEAT) projectiles.\n\nHEAT had posed a serious threat to armoured vehicles since its introduction in [[World War II]]. Lightweight and small, HEAT projectiles could nevertheless penetrate hundreds of millimetres of the hardest [[rolled homogeneous armour|steel armours]]. The capability of most materials for defeating HEAT follows the \"density law\", which states that the penetration of [[shaped charge]] jets is proportional to the square root of the shaped charge liner [[density]] (typically [[copper]]) divided by the square root of the target density. On a weight basis, lighter targets are more advantageous than heavier targets, but using large quantities of lightweight materials has obvious disadvantages in terms of mechanical layout. Certain materials have an optimal compromise in terms of density that makes them particularly useful in this role.<ref name=xm60>[http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=AD524050&Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf Evaluation of Siliceous Cored Armor for the XM60 Tank] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605071506/http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=AD524050&Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf |date=June 5, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe earliest known composite armour for armoured vehicles was developed as part of the [[US Army]]'s [[T95]] experimental series from the mid-1950s. The T95 featured \"'''siliceous-cored armor'''\" which contained a plate of [[fused silica]] [[glass]] between rolled [[steel]] plates. The stopping power of glass exceeds that of steel armour on a thickness basis and in many cases glass is more than twice as effective as steel on a thickness basis. Although the T95 never entered production, a number of its concepts were used on the [[M60 Patton]], and during the development stage (as the XM60) the siliceous-cored armour was at least considered for use, although it was not a feature of the production vehicles.<ref name=xm60/>\n\nThe first widespread use of a composite armour appears to have been on the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[T-64]]. It used an armour known as [[Combination K]], which apparently is [[glass-reinforced plastic]] sandwiched between inner and outer steel layers. Through a mechanism called [[thixotropy]], the [[resin]] changes to a fluid under constant pressure, allowing the armour to be [[moulded]] into curved shapes. Later models of the T-64, along with newer designs, used a [[boron carbide]]-filled resin [[aggregate (composite)|aggregate]] for greatly improved protection. The Soviets also invested heavily in [[reactive armour]], which allowed them some ability to control quality, even after production.\n\nThe most common type of [[composite material|composite]] armour today is [[Chobham armour]],{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} first developed and used by the British in the experimental [[FV 4211 tank]], which was based on [[Chieftain tank]] components. Chobham sandwiches a layer of [[ceramic]] between two plates of steel armour, which was shown to dramatically increase the resistance to HEAT projectiles, even in comparison to other composite armour designs. Chobham was such an improvement that it was soon used on the new U.S. [[M1 Abrams]] [[main battle tank]] (MBT) as well. It is the fabrication of the ceramic in large tiles that gives the [[Challenger 2|Challenger]] and Abrams their \"slab sided\" look.\n\n==Design==\nChobham's precise mechanism for defeating HEAT projectiles was uncovered in the 1980s. High speed photography showed that the ceramic material [[Fracture|shatters]] as the HEAT projectile penetrates, the highly energetic fragments destroying the geometry of the metal jet generated by the hollow [[shaped charge]], greatly diminishing the penetration. The effectiveness of the system was amply demonstrated in [[Desert Storm]], where not a single [[British Army]] Challenger tank was lost to enemy tank fire. (However, one was [[Challenger 2 tank#Operational usage|destroyed by friendly fire]] on March 25, 2003, killing two crew members after a [[High explosive squash head|HESH]] projectile detonated on the commander's hatch causing high-velocity fragments to enter the [[gun turret|turret]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/C2384518-7EBA-4CFF-B127-E87871E41B51/0/boi_challenger2_25mar03.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121026065214/http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/C2384518-7EBA-4CFF-B127-E87871E41B51/0/boi_challenger2_25mar03.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-10-26 |title=UK Ministry of Defence : Army Board of Inquiry Report |format=PDF |accessdate=2016-07-06 }}</ref>) Chobham-type armour is currently in its third generation and is used on modern western tanks such as the [[Challenger 2 tank|British Challenger 2]] and the American [[M1 Abrams]]. The Abrams is also unique in its usage of [[Depleted uranium|depleted uranium armour]] plates in conjunction with composite armour, increasing overall vehicle protection.\n\n==Usage==\nAll modern third-generation main battle tanks use composite armour arrays in their construction. While many of these vehicles feature the composite armour permanently integrated with the vehicle, the Japanese [[Type 10]] and [[Type 90 Ky\u016b-maru]] MBTs, French [[Leclerc tank|Leclerc]], Iranian [[Karrar (tank)|Karrar]], Turkish [[Altay (tank)|Altay]], Indian [[Arjun (tank)|Arjun]], Italian [[Ariete]]  and Chinese [[Type 96 tank|Type 96]]/98 and [[Type 99 tank|Type 99]] tanks use a modular composite armour, where sections of the composite armour can be easily and quickly switched out or upgraded with armour modules. The adoption of modular composite armour design facilitates far more efficient and easier upgrades and exchanges of the armour. \n\nSoviet/Russian main battle tanks such as [[T-90]]<nowiki/>s [[T-80]]Us and the Chinese Type 96/99s use composite armour in tandem with [[reactive armour#Explosive reactive armour|explosive reactive armour]] (ERA), making it hard for shaped charge munitions such as HEAT projectiles and missile warheads to penetrate the frontal and a portion of their side armour. The most advanced versions of these armours such as the [[Kontakt-5|Relikt and Kontakt-5]] armour provide protection not only against shaped charges but also [[Kinetic energy penetrator|kinetic energy penetrators]] by using the explosive force to shear the projectile apart.\n\nApplique armour has also been used in conjunction with composite armour to provide increased amounts of protection and to supplant existing composite arrays on a vehicle. The German [[Leopard 2|Leopard 2A5]] featured distinctive arrowhead laminated armour modules that was mounted directly onto the turret composite arrays, increasing protection markedly above the previous 2A4 model. \n\nComposite armour has since been applied to smaller vehicles, right down to [[jeep]]-sized automobiles. Many of these systems are applied as upgrades to existing armour, which makes them difficult to place around the entire vehicle. Nevertheless, they are often surprisingly effective; upgrades with [[MEXAS]] ceramic armour to Canadian [[M113 armored personnel carrier|M113s]] were carried out in the 1990s, after it was realized that it would offer more protection than newly built [[Infantry Fighting Vehicles |IFVs]] like the [[M2 Bradley]].{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\n==Improvised==\nIn 2004, [[Marvin Heemeyer]] used an ''ad hoc'' composite armour on his [[Komatsu Limited|Komatsu D355A]] [[bulldozer]] (\"Killdozer\") used in a rampage in response to a dispute with the city he lived in over a zoning issue. The armour, at some places a foot thick, consisted of a layer of [[concrete]] sandwiched between layers of [[steel]], successfully rendering the vehicle impervious to [[small arms]] fire and small explosives used by law enforcement in an attempt to stop the vehicle.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Advanced Modular Armor Protection|AMAP]]\n*[[Chobham armour]]\n*[[Combination K]]\n*[[Compound armour]]\n*[[Kanchan armour]]\n*[[MEXAS]]\n*[[Plastic composite (disambiguation)]]\n*[[Pykrete]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Composite Armour}}\n[[Category:Vehicle armour]]\n[[Category:Composite materials|Armour, Composite]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Type of vehicle armour}}\n{{Refimprove|date=September 2009}}\n{{Expert-subject|Military history/Military science and technology task force|date=September 2009}}\n{{stack|\n[[File:Plasan SandCat.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Plasan Sand Cat]] light (5t) military vehicle featuring integrated composite armoured body]]\n[[File:Add-on kit.png|thumb|250px|Vehicle  add-on armour kit manufactured by [[Composhield]]]]\n[[File:Challenger2-Bergen-Hohne-Training-Area-2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[British Army]]'s [[Challenger 2]] [[main battle tank]] uses [[Chobham armour]].]]\n[[File:IDET2007 composite armor ballistic test.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ceramic-aramid composite laminate armour, ballistic test results]]\n[[File:IDET2007 ceramic armor tiles.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ceramic tiles for vehicles]]\n[[File:IDET2007 ceramic armor tiles SICADUR.jpg|thumb|right|250px|SICADUR [[silicon carbide]] tiles for vehicles]]\n}}\n\n'''Composite armour''' is a type of [[vehicle armour]] consisting of layers of different material such as [[metal]]s, [[plastics]], [[ceramic]]s or [[air]].

The most advanced versions of these armours such as the [[Kontakt-5|Relikt and Kontakt-5]] armour provide protection not only against shaped charges but also [[Kinetic energy penetrator|kinetic energy penetrators]] by using the explosive force to shear the projectile apart.\n\nApplique armour has also been used in conjunction with composite armour to provide increased amounts of protection and to supplant existing composite arrays on a vehicle. The German [[Leopard 2|Leopard 2A5]] featured distinctive arrowhead laminated armour modules that was mounted directly onto the turret composite arrays, increasing protection markedly above the previous 2A4 model. \n\nComposite armour has since been applied to smaller vehicles, right down to [[jeep]]-sized automobiles. Many of these systems are applied as upgrades to existing armour, which makes them difficult to place around the entire vehicle. Nevertheless, they are often surprisingly effective; upgrades with [[MEXAS]] ceramic armour to Canadian [[M113 armored personnel carrier|M113s]] were carried out in the 1990s, after it was realized that it would offer more protection than newly built [[Infantry Fighting Vehicles |IFVs]] like the [[M2 Bradley]].{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\n==Improvised==\nIn 2004, [[Marvin Heemeyer]] used an ''ad hoc'' composite armour on his [[Komatsu Limited|Komatsu D355A]] [[bulldozer]] (\"Killdozer\") used in a rampage in response to a dispute with the city he lived in over a zoning issue.

After only one semester there, he travelled to Geneva and moved to Paris in 1958. His life in Paris was characterized by financial hardship and social isolation, which was worsened by his difficulty learning the French language. He earned money by painting portraits, which he likened to prostitution and signed with his family name \"Javachef\" while his early works were signed \"Christo.\" In 1973, after 17 stateless years, Christo became a United States citizen.<ref>{{cite news |author=Randy Kennedy |title=Christo, Trump and the Art World's Biggest Protest Yet |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/arts/design/christo-protest-donald-trump-colorado-artwork.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fscience&action=click&contentCollection=science&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=10&pgtype=sectionfront|quote= |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 25, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Jeanne-Claude===\n'''Jeanne-Claude Denat de Guillebon''' came from an old French family.

Initially, Christo was attracted to Jeanne-Claude's half-sister, Joyce. Jeanne-Claude was engaged to Philippe Planchon. Shortly before her wedding, Jeanne-Claude became pregnant by Christo. Although she married Planchon, Jeanne-Claude left him immediately after their honeymoon. Christo and Jeanne-Claude's son, [[Cyril Christo | Cyril]], was born 11 May 1960. Jeanne-Claude's parents were displeased with the relationship, particularly because of Christo's refugee status, and temporarily estranged themselves from their daughter.\n\nIn 1961, Christo and Jeanne-Claude covered barrels at the port of [[Cologne]], their first collaboration. In 1962, the couple tackled their first monumental project, ''Rideau de Fer'' (Iron Curtain). Without consent of authorities and as a statement against the [[Berlin Wall]], they blocked off Rue Visconti, a small street near the River [[Seine]], with oil barrels. Jeanne-Claude stalled approaching police, persuading them to allow the piece to stand for a few hours. Although he was simultaneously holding his first exhibition at a gallery, it was the Visconti project that made Christo and Jeanne-Claude known in Paris.\n\nIn February 1964, Christo and Jeanne-Claude arrived in New York City. After a brief return to Europe, they settled in the United States in September of that year. Although poor and lacking fluency in English, Christo displayed his work in several galleries, including the well-known [[Leo Castelli|Castelli Gallery]] in New York and Gallery Schmela in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], Germany. Christo began to create storefronts, which he built to scale. Sale of the storefronts helped finance larger projects.\n\n==Major works==\n[[File:Pont Neuf emball\u00e9 par Christo (1985).jpg|thumb|300px|Pont Neuf wrapped up]]\nOn all their projects since 1972 they worked exclusively with photographer [[Wolfgang Volz]]. At least five of their major projects were subjects of documentary films by [[Albert and David Maysles]]. Although Jeanne-Claude and Christo worked as creative equals on all of their art projects, only Christo's name appeared on the finished products. This was a conscious decision by both Jeanne-Claude and Christo because of the prejudices against female artists in the art world. Jeanne-Claude said, \"'The decision to use only the name Christo was made deliberately when we were young because it was difficult for one artist to be established and we wanted to put all the chances on our side.'\"<ref>Lewis, Richard, and Susan Lewis. \"Cengage Advantage Books: The Power of Art.\" Google \nBooks. Cengage Learning, 23 Jan. 2008. Web. 04 Mar. 2015.</ref> Therefore, Jeanne-Claude took on the role of Christo's manager in order to advance their success. The pair did not reveal Jeanne-Claude as the second half in the creative process until 1994.\n\n===Oil Barrels===\nJeanne-Claude was a firm believer in the aesthetic beauty of works of art; she said, \"'We want to create works of art of joy and beauty, which we will build because we believe it will be beautiful.'\"<ref name=\"The New York Times 2009\">Grimes, William. \"Jeanne-Claude, Christo's Collaborator on Environmental Canvas, Is Dead at 74.\" ''The New York Times''. ''The New York Times'', 19 Nov. 2009. Web. 04 Mar. 2015.</ref> However, that does not mean that Jeanne-Claude and Christo's artworks were without larger political connotations. Jeanne-Claude and Christo created a piece in response to the building of the Berlin Wall, in 1962. They blocked off the Rue Visconti in Paris with a wall of oil drums. The {{convert|4|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} wall built with oil barrels completely closed the street and blocked all communication between Rue Bonaparte and Rue de Seine. They said, \"This 'iron curtain' can be used as a barricade during a period of public work in the street, or to transform the street into a dead end. Finally, its principle can be extended to a whole area or an entire city.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Christo and Jeanne-Claude|last=Baal-Teshuva|first=Jacob|publisher=Taschen|date=2001|isbn=978-3822859964|location=|pages=18|quote=|via=}}</ref> As the police approached, Jeanne-Claude firmly stood her ground and guarded the art piece, arguing for it to stay in place just for a few more hours.\n\n===Documenta 4===\nIn 1968, Christo and Jeanne-Claude had the chance to participate at the [[Documenta]] 4 in [[Kassel]]. In addition to the sculpture, ''Corridor Storefronts,'' the couple wanted to build an air package with a volume of {{cvt|5600|m3}}, which would be lifted by cranes and visible from a distance of {{cvt|25|km|mi}}. On 24 June 1968, their first attempt to fully inflate the air package failed, as the polyethene skin tore as it was being raised. After two more attempts and repeated repairs, and using two of the largest [[crane (machine)|cranes]] in [[Europe]], the project became a reality on 3 August 1968. The package rose to its maximum height of {{convert|280|ft|m|order=flip}} tall for a total of 10 hours (from 4:00 am through 2:00 pm on 4 August), becoming the largest inflatable structure with no skeleton ever constructed.  Of the $70,000 (USD) cost of this project, Christo and Jeanne-Claude had financed all but $3,000 (USD) from the sale of preparatory drawings, collages, and a Store Front.\n\n===''Wrapped Coast''===\nAt the end of 1969, Jeanne-Claude and Christo wrapped the coast of [[Little Bay, New South Wales|Little Bay]], in [[Sydney, Australia]], on invitation by Australian collector [[John Kaldor]] and as part of the Alcorso-Seekers Travelling Scholarship. With the support of John Kaldor, this became the first visit to Australia for international artists to make new work and the first in the series of [[Kaldor Public Art Projects]].\n\nThe project was supervised by retired army major Ninian Melville and required 110 workers and 15 professional mountain climbers who installed the work over four weeks under the guidance of Christo and Jean-Claude.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Magnusson|first=Tony|date=October-November 2019|title=One million square feet|url=|journal=Look Magazine (Art Gallery Society of New South Wales)|volume=|pages=35|via=}}</ref> Christo recalled the technical aspects were 'very difficult' as it was the first time he had done \"all these construction things\".<ref name=\":0\" /> The project wrapped {{convert|2+1/2|km|mi|spell=in}} of coast and cliffs up to {{convert|26|m|ft}} high and required {{cvt|95600|m2|sqft}} of synthetic fabric and {{cvt|56|km|mi}} of rope. It was the largest single artwork ever made at this time, larger than Mount Rushmore, and visitors took an hour to walk from one end of the work to the other. After initial resistance from the authorities and the public, reactions were largely positive and had an enormous impact on [[Australian art|art in Australia]].\n\n===''Valley Curtain''===\n[[File: A SIX-TON CURTAIN BILLOWS ACROSS RIFLE GAP - CONCEIVED BY ARTIST CHRISTO JAVACHEFF, EXECUTED AT A COST OF $700,000.... - NARA - 544843.jpg|thumb|right|alt=An enormous volume of fabric hangs from a wire across a valley. I the foreground is a telephone pole and several people looking up.|''Valley Curtain'' 1972 (US)]]\nAt the end of 1970, Christo and Jeanne-Claude began their preparations for the ''Valley Curtain'' project. A {{convert|400|m|ft|adj=mid|-long|sp=us}} cloth was to be stretched across Rifle Gap, a valley in the [[Rocky Mountains]] near [[Rifle, Colorado]]. The project required {{cvt|14000|m2|sqft}} of cloth to be hung on four steel cables, fastened with iron bars fixed in concrete on each slope, and {{convert|200|tonnes|short ton}} of concrete.\nThe budget increased to $400,000, causing Christo and Jeanne-Claude additional problems with the financing. Finally, enough works of art were sold to raise the money and, on 10 October 1971, the orange-coloured curtain was ready for hanging, but was torn to shreds by wind and rock. While a second curtain was being manufactured, Christo received a request from a [[Berlin]] art historian to wrap the [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag]] in response to the 1961 \"Project for Wrapping a Public Building.\" On 10 August 1972, the second attempt to hang the cloth succeeded, but only 28 hours later it was destroyed by a storm gale in excess of {{cvt|60|mph|km/h|order=flip}}.\n\nThe project was shown in the documentary film ''[[Christo's Valley Curtain]],'' by [[David and Albert Maysles]], which was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Documentary Short Subject|Best Documentary Short]].<ref name=\"The New York Times\">{{cite news |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/52141/Christo-s-Valley-Curtain/details |title=Christo's Valley Curtain |accessdate=2008-11-30|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\n===''Running Fence''===\n{{Main|Running Fence}}\nIn 1972, Christo and Jeanne-Claude began preparations for ''[[Running Fence]]'': a fabric fence, supported by steel posts and steel cables, running through the landscape and leading into the sea. The fence was to be {{convert|5.5|m|ft|sp=us}} high and {{convert|40|km|mi|sp=us}} long and constructed in Sonoma and Marin Counties, California. For the project, 59 families of ranchers needed to be convinced and the permission of the authorities had to be obtained, so Christo and Jeanne-Claude hired nine lawyers. At the end of 1973, Christo and Jeanne-Claude marked the path of the fence with wooden stakes. On 29 April 1976, the work finally began after a long struggle against bureaucracy. Approximately {{cvt|200000|m2|sqft}} of nylon fabric, 2050 steel posts and {{cvt|145|km|mi}} of steel cable were needed. On 10 September 1976, the work was completed. However, Christo and Jeanne-Claude had to pay a $60,000 fine, because they lacked permission for the coastal region. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n===''Wrapped Walk Ways''===\nIn 1977, Christo and Jeanne-Claude were mostly paying bank loans and trying to save money. In addition, however, they continued to plan their future projects, like wrapping the [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag]] in [[Berlin]] and the [[Pont-Neuf]] in [[Paris]], as well as ''Wrapped Walk Ways'', a covering of footpaths in a [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] park. In November, Christo met his parents, seeing his mother for the first time in 20 years.\n\nWith ''Wrapped Walk Ways'' Christo and Jeanne-Claude covered {{cvt|4.5|km|mi}} of footpaths in [[Loose Park]], a park in [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. Altogether it required 12,500 m<sup>2</sup> of orange-yellow-coloured shiny nylon fabric. Pedestrians enjoyed the artwork for two weeks in October. The cost of this project amounted to $130,000.\n\n===''Surrounded Islands''===\n[[File: Agoncillo - W\u00fcrth Rioja, Museo 30 - Christo.JPG|thumb|alt=Four cafe chairs and a table, a high table, and an upholstered chair are wrapped in fabric and rope.| W\u00fcrth Rioja wrapped chairs]]\nChristo and Jeanne-Claude planned a project based on Jeanne-Claude's idea to surround eleven islands in Miami's [[Biscayne Bay]] with {{cvt|603850|m2|sqft}} of pink [[polypropylene]] floating fabric. It was completed on May 7, 1983, with the aid of 430 workers and could be admired for two weeks. The workers were outfitted with pink long sleeve shirts with pale blue text written on the back reading \u201cChristo Surrounded Islands,\u201d designed and produced by [[Willi Smith]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Willi Smith: Street Couture|last=Earnest|first=Jarrett|publisher=Rizzoli Electa|year=2020|isbn=978-0-8478-6819-3|editor-last=Cunningham Cameron|editor-first=Alexandra|location=New York|pages=50-53|chapter=Willi Smith in Pieces}}</ref>\n\n===Pont Neuf===\n\nOn 14 March 1984, Jeanne-Claude became a U.S. citizen; she held the dual U.S. and [[French citizenship]]. In August, the couple received permission to wrap the [[Pont-Neuf]], (which had been completed in July 1607), after nine years of negotiations with the mayor of Paris, [[Jacques Chirac]], and preparations for the project began. For the wrapping of the oldest bridge in Paris, {{cvt|40000|m2|sqft}} of sand-colored [[polyamide]] fabric was needed. The golden sandstone colour is used to imitate the colour of pavements in Paris under the sunset. The wrapping began on 25 August 1985 and was completed on 22 September. On the 5th of October, the project was removed after being viewed by over three million visitors. All the expenses for ''The Pont Neuf Wrapped'' were borne by the couple themselves. Just as in all other projects, they do not take sponsorship. They usually utilize the money they make just selling the preliminary drawings of the project. \nWrapping the Pont Neuf continued the tradition of transforming a sculptural dimension into a work of art. The fabric maintained the principal shapes of the ''Pont Neuf'' but it emphasized the details and the proportions. As with ''Surrounded Islands,'' workers who assisted with the installation and deinstallation of ''Pont Neuf Wrapped'' wore uniforms designed by Willi Smith. The uniforms consisted of a chambray smock and wide-leg pant ensemble with a printed illustration of the bridge penned by Christo on the back of the jacket.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== ''The Umbrellas'', Japan\u2013US, 1984\u20131991 {{anchor|The Umbrellas}} ===\n[[File:ChristoUmbrellas.jpg|left|100px|alt=Two fabric sample squares, blue on the bottom and yellow slightly overlapping it]]\n[[File: Umbrella Project1991 10 27.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A large field with oversized blue umbrellas at regular intervals. Mountains are barely visible in the background as the fog descends.|''Umbrellas'' 1991 (Japan)]]\nChristo and Jeanne-Claude prepared for their next project, ''The Umbrellas''. The plan was to have yellow umbrellas set up in [[California]] and blue umbrellas in [[Japan]] at the same time. In December 1990, after much preparation, the first steel bases for the umbrellas were installed. At the bases {{convert|80|cm|in|sp=us}} long anchors were fastened to the ground to withstand tensions of {{cvt|1500|kgf|kN|lk=on}}. In September 1991, the umbrellas were brought to their places by 2,000 workers. In California, some of the bases were transported to the site by helicopter. The final cost of the project totalled $26 US million, and it was completely financed by the artists themselves through the sale of preparatory drawings etc; the artists do not take any form of sponsorship.\n\nBy September 7, 1,340 blue umbrellas in [[Ibaraki Prefecture|Ibaraki]] and 1,760 yellow umbrellas at the [[Tejon Ranch]] in southern California had been set up; the exhibition opened on 9 October 1991. The umbrellas were positioned closely together in the limited space of Japan, whereas in California they were placed in all directions in its vast uncultivated land. In total, three million people saw the umbrellas, each measuring {{cvt|6|m|ft|sp=us}} in height and {{cvt|8.66|m|ft|sp=us}} in diameter. On October 27, they started the removal of this project and restored the land to earlier condition. The umbrellas were taken apart and most of the elements were recycled. The umbrellas became a huge tourist attraction, finding use as everything from picnic spots to wedding altars.\n\nOn 26 October 1991, one of the umbrellas in California was toppled by high winds, killing one woman and injuring several others. The exhibit was ordered closed immediately.<ref>{{cite news|date=October 28, 1991|title=Christo Umbrella Crushes Woman|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/28/us/christo-umbrella-crushes-woman.html|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2011-04-20}}</ref> A second death occurred during the removal of the umbrellas.<ref>{{cite news|date=November 1, 1991|title=2d Person Is Killed In Christo Art Project|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/01/arts/2d-person-is-killed-in-christo-art-project.html|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2012-12-01}}</ref>\n\n===Wrapped Reichstag===<!-- This section is linked from [[Reichstag building]] -->\nAfter the project ''The Umbrellas,'' Christo and Jeanne-Claude concerned themselves again with wrapping the [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag]] in [[Berlin]]. With the support of the President of the Parliament, [[Rita S\u00fcssmuth]], Christo and Jeanne-Claude worked to convince the elected Members of Parliament, going from office to office, writing explanatory letters to each of the 662 delegates and innumerable telephone calls and negotiations. On 25 February 1995, after a 70-minute debate at the Parliament and a roll call vote, the [[Bundestag]] allowed the project to go ahead.\n\nJust under {{cvt|100000|m2|sqft}} of fireproof [[polypropylene]] fabric, covered by an [[aluminum]] layer, and {{cvt|15|km|mi}} of [[rope]] were needed. The wrapping began on 17 June 1995 and was finished on 24 June.

A pattern had to be made for each individual tree  so that the natural shape of the branches pushed the fabric outwards, creating individual shapes in the sky. The trees varied in height from {{cvt|2|to|25|m|ft|0}} and in width from {{cvt|1|to about|15|m|ft|0}}. As with their other projects, this was financed by the sale of original works. On view for three weeks, ''Wrapped Trees'' was extremely dynamic: varying silhouettes of trees moved in the wind with the skeletal framework of branches made visible when the translucent material was backlit by the winter sun. All materials used were recycled when it was taken down.\n\n===Wrapped Snoopy House===\nIn 1978, [[Charles M.

They did not accept any sponsorship, nor did the city of New York have to provide any money for the project. Christo and Jeanne-Claude donated all the money raised from the sale of souvenirs such as postcards, T-shirts and posters to \"Nurture New York's Nature, Inc.\" While the engineering, manufacturing and set-up took over a year, about 750 paid employees erected the project in five days and then deployed the fabric of all the gates in half an hour. Around 600 more \"gate-keepers\" distributed one million free fabric samples to visitors. The uniformed gate-keepers provided information to visitors about the project, and were responsible for unrolling the gates that had rolled over their crossbars in the high wind.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} More workers uninstalled the project in one week, leaving almost no trace, and shipping all the materials for recycling.\n\n===''Big Air Package''===\nChristo filled the [[Gasometer Oberhausen]] from 16 March until 30 December 2013 with the installation ''Big Air Package''. After ''The Wall'' (1999) as the final installation of the Emscher Park International Building Exhibition, ''Big Air Package'' was his second work of art in the Gasometer. The \"''Big Air Package'' \u2013 Project for Gasometer Oberhausen, Germany\" was conceived by Christo in 2010 (for the first time without his wife Jeanne-Claude).\nThe sculpture was set up in the interior of the industrial monument and was made of {{cvt|20350|m3|cuft}} of translucent fabric and {{cvt|4500|m|ft}} of rope.

They first met in [[Paris]] in October 1958 when Christo painted a portrait of Jeanne-Claude's mother. They then fell in love through creating art work together.\n\nTheir works include the wrapping of the [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag]] in [[Berlin]] and the [[Pont-Neuf]] bridge in Paris, the {{convert|24|mi|km|order=flip|adj=mid|-long|sp=us}} artwork called ''[[Running Fence]]'' in [[Sonoma County|Sonoma]] and [[Marin County|Marin]] counties in [[California]], and ''[[The Gates]]'' in [[New York City]]'s [[Central Park]].\n\nCredit was given to \"Christo\" only, until 1994, when the outdoor works and large indoor installations were retroactively credited to \"Christo and Jeanne-Claude\".<ref name=JCNYTObit >{{cite news|title=Jeanne-Claude, Collaborator With Christo, Dies at 74|first=William|last=Grimes|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 19, 2009|access-date=November 20, 2009|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/20/arts/design/20jeanne-claude.html}}</ref> They flew in separate planes: in case one crashed, the other could continue their work.<ref name=WSJ>{{cite news|author1=Miller, Stephen  |author2=Crow, Kelly|date=November 20, 2009|title=Part of a Creative Powerhouse Behind Ephemeral Artworks|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125868344992956721|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|publisher=Dow Jones|access-date=November 20, 2009}}</ref>\n\nJeanne-Claude died, aged 74, on November 18, 2009, from complications of a [[brain aneurysm]].<ref name=JCNYTObit/>\n\nAlthough their work is visually impressive and often [[controversial]] as a result of its scale, the artists have repeatedly denied that their projects contain any deeper meaning than their immediate [[aesthetic]] impact. The purpose of their art, they contend, is simply to create works of art for joy and beauty and to create new ways of seeing familiar [[landscape]]s.

Professors from the Academy who visited his family observed Christo's artistic talent while he was still very young.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nChristo studied art at the Sofia Academy from 1953 to 1956 and went to [[Prague]], [[Czechoslovakia]] (now [[Czech Republic]]), until 1957, when he left for the West by bribing a railway official and stowing away with several others on board a train transporting medicine and medical supplies to Austria.\n\nChristo quickly settled in Vienna and enrolled at the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts. After only one semester there, he travelled to Geneva and moved to Paris in 1958. His life in Paris was characterized by financial hardship and social isolation, which was worsened by his difficulty learning the French language. He earned money by painting portraits, which he likened to prostitution and signed with his family name \"Javachef\" while his early works were signed \"Christo.\" In 1973, after 17 stateless years, Christo became a United States citizen.<ref>{{cite news |author=Randy Kennedy |title=Christo, Trump and the Art World's Biggest Protest Yet |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/arts/design/christo-protest-donald-trump-colorado-artwork.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fscience&action=click&contentCollection=science&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=10&pgtype=sectionfront|quote= |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 25, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Jeanne-Claude===\n'''Jeanne-Claude Denat de Guillebon''' came from an old French family.  She was born in [[Casablanca, Morocco]], where her father, an army officer, was stationed. Her mother, Pr\u00e9cilda, was 17 when she married Jeanne-Claude's father, Major L\u00e9on Denat. Pr\u00e9cilda and L\u00e9on Denat divorced shortly after Jeanne-Claude was born, and Pr\u00e9cilda remarried three times.

Initially, Christo was attracted to Jeanne-Claude's half-sister, Joyce. Jeanne-Claude was engaged to Philippe Planchon. Shortly before her wedding, Jeanne-Claude became pregnant by Christo. Although she married Planchon, Jeanne-Claude left him immediately after their honeymoon. Christo and Jeanne-Claude's son, [[Cyril Christo | Cyril]], was born 11 May 1960. Jeanne-Claude's parents were displeased with the relationship, particularly because of Christo's refugee status, and temporarily estranged themselves from their daughter.\n\nIn 1961, Christo and Jeanne-Claude covered barrels at the port of [[Cologne]], their first collaboration. In 1962, the couple tackled their first monumental project, ''Rideau de Fer'' (Iron Curtain). Without consent of authorities and as a statement against the [[Berlin Wall]], they blocked off Rue Visconti, a small street near the River [[Seine]], with oil barrels. Jeanne-Claude stalled approaching police, persuading them to allow the piece to stand for a few hours. Although he was simultaneously holding his first exhibition at a gallery, it was the Visconti project that made Christo and Jeanne-Claude known in Paris.\n\nIn February 1964, Christo and Jeanne-Claude arrived in New York City. After a brief return to Europe, they settled in the United States in September of that year. Although poor and lacking fluency in English, Christo displayed his work in several galleries, including the well-known [[Leo Castelli|Castelli Gallery]] in New York and Gallery Schmela in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], Germany. Christo began to create storefronts, which he built to scale. Sale of the storefronts helped finance larger projects.\n\n==Major works==\n[[File:Pont Neuf emball\u00e9 par Christo (1985).jpg|thumb|300px|Pont Neuf wrapped up]]\nOn all their projects since 1972 they worked exclusively with photographer [[Wolfgang Volz]]. At least five of their major projects were subjects of documentary films by [[Albert and David Maysles]]. Although Jeanne-Claude and Christo worked as creative equals on all of their art projects, only Christo's name appeared on the finished products. This was a conscious decision by both Jeanne-Claude and Christo because of the prejudices against female artists in the art world. Jeanne-Claude said, \"'The decision to use only the name Christo was made deliberately when we were young because it was difficult for one artist to be established and we wanted to put all the chances on our side.'\"<ref>Lewis, Richard, and Susan Lewis. \"Cengage Advantage Books: The Power of Art.\" Google \nBooks. Cengage Learning, 23 Jan. 2008. Web. 04 Mar. 2015.</ref> Therefore, Jeanne-Claude took on the role of Christo's manager in order to advance their success. The pair did not reveal Jeanne-Claude as the second half in the creative process until 1994.\n\n===Oil Barrels===\nJeanne-Claude was a firm believer in the aesthetic beauty of works of art; she said, \"'We want to create works of art of joy and beauty, which we will build because we believe it will be beautiful.'\"<ref name=\"The New York Times 2009\">Grimes, William. \"Jeanne-Claude, Christo's Collaborator on Environmental Canvas, Is Dead at 74.\" ''The New York Times''. ''The New York Times'', 19 Nov. 2009. Web. 04 Mar. 2015.</ref> However, that does not mean that Jeanne-Claude and Christo's artworks were without larger political connotations. Jeanne-Claude and Christo created a piece in response to the building of the Berlin Wall, in 1962. They blocked off the Rue Visconti in Paris with a wall of oil drums. The {{convert|4|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} wall built with oil barrels completely closed the street and blocked all communication between Rue Bonaparte and Rue de Seine. They said, \"This 'iron curtain' can be used as a barricade during a period of public work in the street, or to transform the street into a dead end. Finally, its principle can be extended to a whole area or an entire city.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Christo and Jeanne-Claude|last=Baal-Teshuva|first=Jacob|publisher=Taschen|date=2001|isbn=978-3822859964|location=|pages=18|quote=|via=}}</ref> As the police approached, Jeanne-Claude firmly stood her ground and guarded the art piece, arguing for it to stay in place just for a few more hours.\n\n===Documenta 4===\nIn 1968, Christo and Jeanne-Claude had the chance to participate at the [[Documenta]] 4 in [[Kassel]]. In addition to the sculpture, ''Corridor Storefronts,'' the couple wanted to build an air package with a volume of {{cvt|5600|m3}}, which would be lifted by cranes and visible from a distance of {{cvt|25|km|mi}}. On 24 June 1968, their first attempt to fully inflate the air package failed, as the polyethene skin tore as it was being raised. After two more attempts and repeated repairs, and using two of the largest [[crane (machine)|cranes]] in [[Europe]], the project became a reality on 3 August 1968. The package rose to its maximum height of {{convert|280|ft|m|order=flip}} tall for a total of 10 hours (from 4:00 am through 2:00 pm on 4 August), becoming the largest inflatable structure with no skeleton ever constructed.  Of the $70,000 (USD) cost of this project, Christo and Jeanne-Claude had financed all but $3,000 (USD) from the sale of preparatory drawings, collages, and a Store Front.\n\n===''Wrapped Coast''===\nAt the end of 1969, Jeanne-Claude and Christo wrapped the coast of [[Little Bay, New South Wales|Little Bay]], in [[Sydney, Australia]], on invitation by Australian collector John Kaldor and as part of the Alcorso-Seekers Travelling Scholarship. With the support of John Kaldor, this became the first visit to Australia for international artists to make new work and the first in the series of Kaldor Public Art Projects.\n\nThe project was supervised by retired army major Ninian Melville and required 110 workers and 15 professional mountain climbers who installed the work over four weeks under the guidance of Christo and Jean-Claude.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Magnusson|first=Tony|date=October-November 2019|title=One million square feet|url=|journal=Look Magazine (Art Gallery Society of New South Wales)|volume=|pages=35|via=}}</ref> Christo recalled the technical aspects were 'very difficult' as it was the first time he had done \"all these construction things\".<ref name=\":0\" /> The project wrapped {{convert|2+1/2|km|mi|spell=in}} of coast and cliffs up to {{convert|26|m|ft}} high and required {{cvt|95600|m2|sqft}} of synthetic fabric and {{cvt|56|km|mi}} of rope. It was the largest single artwork ever made at this time, larger than Mount Rushmore, and visitors took an hour to walk from one end of the work to the other. After initial resistance from the authorities and the public, reactions were largely positive and had an enormous impact on [[Australian art|art in Australia]].\n\n===''Valley Curtain''===\n[[File: A SIX-TON CURTAIN BILLOWS ACROSS RIFLE GAP - CONCEIVED BY ARTIST CHRISTO JAVACHEFF, EXECUTED AT A COST OF $700,000.... - NARA - 544843.jpg|thumb|right|alt=An enormous volume of fabric hangs from a wire across a valley. I the foreground is a telephone pole and several people looking up.|''Valley Curtain'' 1972 (US)]]\nAt the end of 1970, Christo and Jeanne-Claude began their preparations for the ''Valley Curtain'' project. A {{convert|400|m|ft|adj=mid|-long|sp=us}} cloth was to be stretched across Rifle Gap, a valley in the [[Rocky Mountains]] near [[Rifle, Colorado]]. The project required {{cvt|14000|m2|sqft}} of cloth to be hung on four steel cables, fastened with iron bars fixed in concrete on each slope, and {{convert|200|tonnes|short ton}} of concrete.\nThe budget increased to $400,000, causing Christo and Jeanne-Claude additional problems with the financing. Finally, enough works of art were sold to raise the money and, on 10 October 1971, the orange-coloured curtain was ready for hanging, but was torn to shreds by wind and rock. While a second curtain was being manufactured, Christo received a request from a [[Berlin]] art historian to wrap the [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag]] in response to the 1961 \"Project for Wrapping a Public Building.\" On 10 August 1972, the second attempt to hang the cloth succeeded, but only 28 hours later it was destroyed by a storm gale in excess of {{cvt|60|mph|km/h|order=flip}}.\n\nThe project was shown in the documentary film ''[[Christo's Valley Curtain]],'' by [[David and Albert Maysles]], which was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Documentary Short Subject|Best Documentary Short]].<ref name=\"The New York Times\">{{cite news |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/52141/Christo-s-Valley-Curtain/details |title=Christo's Valley Curtain |accessdate=2008-11-30|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\n===''Running Fence''===\n{{Main|Running Fence}}\nIn 1972, Christo and Jeanne-Claude began preparations for ''[[Running Fence]]'': a fabric fence, supported by steel posts and steel cables, running through the landscape and leading into the sea. The fence was to be {{convert|5.5|m|ft|sp=us}} high and {{convert|40|km|mi|sp=us}} long and constructed in Sonoma and Marin Counties, California. For the project, 59 families of ranchers needed to be convinced and the permission of the authorities had to be obtained, so Christo and Jeanne-Claude hired nine lawyers. At the end of 1973, Christo and Jeanne-Claude marked the path of the fence with wooden stakes. On 29 April 1976, the work finally began after a long struggle against bureaucracy. Approximately {{cvt|200000|m2|sqft}} of nylon fabric, 2050 steel posts and {{cvt|145|km|mi}} of steel cable were needed. On 10 September 1976, the work was completed. However, Christo and Jeanne-Claude had to pay a $60,000 fine, because they lacked permission for the coastal region. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n===''Wrapped Walk Ways''===\nIn 1977, Christo and Jeanne-Claude were mostly paying bank loans and trying to save money. In addition, however, they continued to plan their future projects, like wrapping the [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag]] in [[Berlin]] and the [[Pont-Neuf]] in [[Paris]], as well as ''Wrapped Walk Ways'', a covering of footpaths in a [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] park. In November, Christo met his parents, seeing his mother for the first time in 20 years.\n\nWith ''Wrapped Walk Ways'' Christo and Jeanne-Claude covered {{cvt|4.5|km|mi}} of footpaths in [[Loose Park]], a park in [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. Altogether it required 12,500 m<sup>2</sup> of orange-yellow-coloured shiny nylon fabric. Pedestrians enjoyed the artwork for two weeks in October. The cost of this project amounted to $130,000.\n\n===''Surrounded Islands''===\n[[File: Agoncillo - W\u00fcrth Rioja, Museo 30 - Christo.JPG|thumb|alt=Four cafe chairs and a table, a high table, and an upholstered chair are wrapped in fabric and rope.| W\u00fcrth Rioja wrapped chairs]]\nChristo and Jeanne-Claude planned a project based on Jeanne-Claude's idea to surround eleven islands in Miami's [[Biscayne Bay]] with {{cvt|603850|m2|sqft}} of pink [[polypropylene]] floating fabric. It was completed on May 7, 1983, with the aid of 430 workers and could be admired for two weeks. The workers were outfitted with pink long sleeve shirts with pale blue text written on the back reading \u201cChristo Surrounded Islands,\u201d designed and produced by [[Willi Smith]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Willi Smith: Street Couture|last=Earnest|first=Jarrett|publisher=Rizzoli Electa|year=2020|isbn=978-0-8478-6819-3|editor-last=Cunningham Cameron|editor-first=Alexandra|location=New York|pages=50-53|chapter=Willi Smith in Pieces}}</ref>\n\n===Pont Neuf===\n\nOn 14 March 1984, Jeanne-Claude became a U.S. citizen; she held the dual U.S. and [[French citizenship]]. In August, the couple received permission to wrap the [[Pont-Neuf]], (which had been completed in July 1607), after nine years of negotiations with the mayor of Paris, [[Jacques Chirac]], and preparations for the project began. For the wrapping of the oldest bridge in Paris, {{cvt|40000|m2|sqft}} of sand-colored [[polyamide]] fabric was needed. The golden sandstone colour is used to imitate the colour of pavements in Paris under the sunset. The wrapping began on 25 August 1985 and was completed on 22 September. On the 5th of October, the project was removed after being viewed by over three million visitors. All the expenses for ''The Pont Neuf Wrapped'' were borne by the couple themselves. Just as in all other projects, they do not take sponsorship. They usually utilize the money they make just selling the preliminary drawings of the project. \nWrapping the Pont Neuf continued the tradition of transforming a sculptural dimension into a work of art. The fabric maintained the principal shapes of the ''Pont Neuf'' but it emphasized the details and the proportions. As with ''Surrounded Islands,'' workers who assisted with the installation and deinstallation of ''Pont Neuf Wrapped'' wore uniforms designed by Willi Smith. The uniforms consisted of a chambray smock and wide-leg pant ensemble with a printed illustration of the bridge penned by Christo on the back of the jacket.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== ''The Umbrellas'', Japan\u2013US, 1984\u20131991 {{anchor|The Umbrellas}} ===\n[[File:ChristoUmbrellas.jpg|left|100px|alt=Two fabric sample squares, blue on the bottom and yellow slightly overlapping it]]\n[[File: Umbrella Project1991 10 27.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A large field with oversized blue umbrellas at regular intervals. Mountains are barely visible in the background as the fog descends.|''Umbrellas'' 1991 (Japan)]]\nChristo and Jeanne-Claude prepared for their next project, ''The Umbrellas''. The plan was to have yellow umbrellas set up in [[California]] and blue umbrellas in [[Japan]] at the same time. In December 1990, after much preparation, the first steel bases for the umbrellas were installed. At the bases {{convert|80|cm|in|sp=us}} long anchors were fastened to the ground to withstand tensions of {{cvt|1500|kgf|kN|lk=on}}. In September 1991, the umbrellas were brought to their places by 2,000 workers. In California, some of the bases were transported to the site by helicopter. The final cost of the project totalled $26 US million, and it was completely financed by the artists themselves through the sale of preparatory drawings etc; the artists do not take any form of sponsorship.\n\nBy September 7, 1,340 blue umbrellas in [[Ibaraki Prefecture|Ibaraki]] and 1,760 yellow umbrellas at the [[Tejon Ranch]] in southern California had been set up; the exhibition opened on 9 October 1991. The umbrellas were positioned closely together in the limited space of Japan, whereas in California they were placed in all directions in its vast uncultivated land. In total, three million people saw the umbrellas, each measuring {{cvt|6|m|ft|sp=us}} in height and {{cvt|8.66|m|ft|sp=us}} in diameter. On October 27, they started the removal of this project and restored the land to earlier condition. The umbrellas were taken apart and most of the elements were recycled. The umbrellas became a huge tourist attraction, finding use as everything from picnic spots to wedding altars.\n\nOn 26 October 1991, one of the umbrellas in California was toppled by high winds, killing one woman and injuring several others. The exhibit was ordered closed immediately.<ref>{{cite news|date=October 28, 1991|title=Christo Umbrella Crushes Woman|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/28/us/christo-umbrella-crushes-woman.html|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2011-04-20}}</ref> A second death occurred during the removal of the umbrellas.<ref>{{cite news|date=November 1, 1991|title=2d Person Is Killed In Christo Art Project|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/01/arts/2d-person-is-killed-in-christo-art-project.html|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2012-12-01}}</ref>\n\n===Wrapped Reichstag===<!-- This section is linked from [[Reichstag building]] -->\nAfter the project ''The Umbrellas,'' Christo and Jeanne-Claude concerned themselves again with wrapping the [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag]] in [[Berlin]]. With the support of the President of the Parliament, [[Rita S\u00fcssmuth]], Christo and Jeanne-Claude worked to convince the elected Members of Parliament, going from office to office, writing explanatory letters to each of the 662 delegates and innumerable telephone calls and negotiations. On 25 February 1995, after a 70-minute debate at the Parliament and a roll call vote, the [[Bundestag]] allowed the project to go ahead.\n\nJust under {{cvt|100000|m2|sqft}} of fireproof [[polypropylene]] fabric, covered by an [[aluminum]] layer, and {{cvt|15|km|mi}} of [[rope]] were needed. The wrapping began on 17 June 1995 and was finished on 24 June.

A pattern had to be made for each individual tree  so that the natural shape of the branches pushed the fabric outwards, creating individual shapes in the sky. The trees varied in height from {{cvt|2|to|25|m|ft|0}} and in width from {{cvt|1|to about|15|m|ft|0}}. As with their other projects, this was financed by the sale of original works. On view for three weeks, ''Wrapped Trees'' was extremely dynamic: varying silhouettes of trees moved in the wind with the skeletal framework of branches made visible when the translucent material was backlit by the winter sun. All materials used were recycled when it was taken down.\n\n===Wrapped Snoopy House===\nIn 1978, [[Charles M.

They did not accept any sponsorship, nor did the city of New York have to provide any money for the project. Christo and Jeanne-Claude donated all the money raised from the sale of souvenirs such as postcards, T-shirts and posters to \"Nurture New York's Nature, Inc.\" While the engineering, manufacturing and set-up took over a year, about 750 paid employees erected the project in five days and then deployed the fabric of all the gates in half an hour. Around 600 more \"gate-keepers\" distributed one million free fabric samples to visitors. The uniformed gate-keepers provided information to visitors about the project, and were responsible for unrolling the gates that had rolled over their crossbars in the high wind.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} More workers uninstalled the project in one week, leaving almost no trace, and shipping all the materials for recycling.\n\n===''Big Air Package''===\nChristo filled the [[Gasometer Oberhausen]] from 16 March until 30 December 2013 with the installation ''Big Air Package''. After ''The Wall'' (1999) as the final installation of the Emscher Park International Building Exhibition, ''Big Air Package'' was his second work of art in the Gasometer. The \"''Big Air Package'' \u2013 Project for Gasometer Oberhausen, Germany\" was conceived by Christo in 2010 (for the first time without his wife Jeanne-Claude).\nThe sculpture was set up in the interior of the industrial monument and was made of {{cvt|20350|m3|cuft}} of translucent fabric and {{cvt|4500|m|ft}} of rope.

language|multi-paradigm]] [[numerical analysis|numerical computing]] environment and [[proprietary programming language]] developed by [[MathWorks]]. MATLAB allows [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] manipulations, plotting of [[function (mathematics)|functions]] and data, implementation of [[algorithm]]s, creation of [[user interface]]s, and interfacing with programs written in other languages.\n\nAlthough MATLAB is intended primarily for numerical computing, an optional toolbox uses the [[MuPAD]] [[computer algebra system|symbolic engine]] allowing access to [[symbolic computing]] abilities. An additional package, [[Simulink]], adds graphical multi-domain simulation and [[model-based design]] for [[dynamical system|dynamic]] and [[embedded system]]s.\n\nAs of 2018, MATLAB has more than 3 million users worldwide.<ref name=\"mathworksCompanyOverview\">{{cite web |url=https://www.mathworks.com/content/dam/mathworks/tag-team/Objects/c/company-fact-sheet-8282v18.pdf |title=Company Overview |author = The MathWorks |date=April 2018}}</ref> MATLAB users come from various backgrounds of [[engineering]], [[science]], and [[economics]].\n\n== History ==\n[[Cleve Moler]], the chairman of the [[computer science]] department at the [[University of New Mexico]], started developing MATLAB in the late 1970s.<ref name=\"origins\">{{cite web | url = http://www.mathworks.com/company/newsletters/articles/the-origins-of-matlab.html | title = The Origins of MATLAB| author = Cleve Moler | accessdate = April 15, 2007 |date=December 2004 }}</ref> He designed it to give his students access to [[LINPACK]] and [[EISPACK]] without them having to learn [[Fortran]]. It soon spread to other universities and found a strong audience within the [[applied mathematics]] community. [[John N. Little|Jack Little]], an engineer, was exposed to it during a visit Moler made to [[Stanford University]] in 1983. Recognizing its commercial potential, he joined with Moler and Steve Bangert. They rewrote MATLAB in [[C (programming language)|C]] and founded [[MathWorks]] in 1984 to continue its development. These rewritten libraries were known as JACKPAC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altiusdirectory.com/Computers/matlab-programming-language.php|title=MATLAB Programming Language|publisher=Altius Directory|accessdate=December 17, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103203721/http://www.altiusdirectory.com/Computers/matlab-programming-language.php|archive-date=January 3, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2000, MATLAB was rewritten to use a newer set of libraries for matrix manipulation, [[LAPACK]].<ref>{{cite web|title=MATLAB Incorporates LAPACK|url=http://www.mathworks.com/company/newsletters/articles/matlab-incorporates-lapack.html|work=Cleve's Corner|publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=December 20, 2008|first=Cleve |last=Moler|date=January 2000}}</ref>\n\nMATLAB was first adopted by researchers and practitioners in [[control engineering]], Little's specialty, but quickly spread to many other domains. It is now also used in education, in particular the teaching of [[linear algebra]] and [[numerical analysis]], and is popular amongst scientists involved in [[image processing]].<ref name=\"origins\" />\n\n== Syntax ==\nThe MATLAB application is built around the MATLAB programming language. Common usage of the MATLAB application involves using the \"Command Window\" as an interactive mathematical [[command line interface|shell]] or executing text files containing MATLAB code.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/index.html|title=MATLAB Documentation |publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Variables ===\nVariables are defined using the assignment operator, <code>=</code>. MATLAB is a [[Strong and weak typing|weakly typed]] programming language because types are implicitly converted.<ref>{{cite web|title=Comparing MATLAB with Other OO Languages|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_oop/matlab-vs-other-oo-languages.html|work=MATLAB|publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}</ref>  It is an inferred typed language because variables can be assigned without declaring their type, except if they are to be treated as symbolic objects,<ref>{{cite web|title=Create Symbolic Variables and Expressions|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/creating-symbolic-variables-and-expressions.html|work=Symbolic Math Toolbox|publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}</ref> and that their type can change. Values can come from [[constant (computer science)|constant]]s, from computation involving values of other variables, or from the output of a function. For example:\n<source lang=\"matlabsession\">\n>> x = 17\nx =\n 17\n\n>> x = 'hat'\nx =\nhat\n\n>> x = [3*4, pi/2]\nx =\n   12.0000    1.5708\n\n>> y = 3*sin(x)\ny =\n   -1.6097    3.0000\n</source>\n\n=== Vectors and matrices ===\nA simple array is defined using the colon syntax: ''initial''<code>:</code>''increment''<code>:</code>''terminator''. For instance:\n<source lang=\"matlab\">\n>> array = 1:2:9\narray =\n 1 3 5 7 9\n</source>\ndefines a variable named <code>array</code> (or assigns a new value to an existing variable with the name <code>array</code>) which is an array consisting of the values 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. That is, the array starts at 1 (the ''initial'' value), increments with each step from the previous value by 2 (the ''increment'' value), and stops once it reaches (or to avoid exceeding) 9 (the ''terminator'' value).\n<source lang=\"matlab\">\n>> array = 1:3:9\narray =\n 1 4 7\n</source>\nthe ''increment'' value can actually be left out of this syntax (along with one of the colons), to use a default value of 1.\n<source lang=\"matlab\">\n>> ari = 1:5\nari =\n 1 2 3 4 5\n</source>\nassigns to the variable named <code>ari</code> an array with the values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, since the default value of 1 is used as the increment.\n\n[[One-based indexing|Indexing]] is one-based,<ref>{{cite web|title=Matrix Indexing|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/math/matrix-indexing.html|publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}</ref> which is the usual convention for [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] in mathematics, unlike zero-based indexing commonly used in other programming languages such as C, C++, and Java.\n\nMatrices can be defined by separating the elements of a row with blank space or comma and using a semicolon to terminate each row. The list of elements should be surrounded by square brackets <code>[]</code>. Parentheses <code>()</code> are used to access elements and subarrays (they are also used to denote a function argument list).\n\n<source lang=\"matlab\">\n>> A = [16 3 2 13; 5 10 11 8; 9 6 7 12; 4 15 14 1]\nA =\n 16  3  2 13\n  5 10 11  8\n  9  6  7 12\n  4 15 14  1\n\n>> A(2,3)\nans =\n 11\n</source>\n\nSets of indices can be specified by expressions such as <code>2:4</code>, which evaluates to <code>[2, 3, 4]</code>.  For example, a submatrix taken from rows 2 through 4 and columns 3 through 4 can be written as:\n<source lang=\"matlab\">\n>> A(2:4,3:4)\nans =\n 11 8\n 7 12\n 14 1\n</source>\nA square [[identity matrix]] of size ''n'' can be generated using the function <code>eye</code>, and matrices of any size with zeros or ones can be generated with the functions <code>zeros</code> and <code>ones</code>, respectively.\n<source lang=\"matlab\">\n>> eye(3,3)\nans =\n 1 0 0\n 0 1 0\n 0 0 1\n\n>> zeros(2,3)\nans =\n 0 0 0\n 0 0 0\n\n>> ones(2,3)\nans =\n 1 1 1\n 1 1 1\n</source>\n\n[[Transpose|Transposing]] a vector or a matrix is done either by the function <code>transpose</code> or by adding dot-prime after the matrix (without the dot, prime will perform [[conjugate transpose]] for complex arrays):\n<source lang=\"matlab\">\n>> A = [1 ; 2],  B = A.', C = transpose(A)\nA =\n     1\n     2\nB =\n     1     2\nC =\n     1     2\n\n>> D = [0 3 ; 1 5], D.'\nD =\n     0     3\n     1     5\nans =\n     0     1\n     3     5\n</source>\n\nMost functions accept arrays as input and operate element-wise on each element. For example, <code>mod(2*J,n)</code> will multiply every element in ''J'' by 2, and then reduce each element modulo ''n''. MATLAB does include standard <code>for</code> and <code>while</code> loops, but (as in other similar applications such as [[R (programming language)|R]]), using the [[Array programming|vectorized]] notation is encouraged and is often faster to execute. The following code, excerpted from the function ''magic.m'', creates a [[magic square]] ''M'' for odd values of ''n'' (MATLAB function <code>meshgrid</code> is used here to generate square matrices ''I'' and ''J'' containing ''1:n'').\n\n<source lang=\"matlab\">\n[J,I] = meshgrid(1:n);\nA = mod(I + J - (n + 3) / 2, n);\nB = mod(I + 2 * J - 2, n);\nM = n * A + B + 1;\n</source>\n\n=== Structures ===\nMATLAB supports structure data types.<ref>{{cite web|title=Structures|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/structures.html|publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}</ref> Since all variables in MATLAB are arrays, a more adequate name is \"structure array\", where each element of the array has the same field names. In addition, MATLAB supports dynamic field names<ref>{{cite web|title=Generate Field Names from Variables|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/generate-field-names-from-variables.html|publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}</ref> (field look-ups by name, field manipulations, etc.).\n\n=== Functions ===\nWhen creating a MATLAB function, the name of the file should match the name of the first function in the file. Valid function names begin with an alphabetic character, and can contain letters, numbers, or underscores.

MATLAB has value classes and reference classes, depending on whether the class has ''handle'' as a super-class (for reference classes) or not (for value classes).<ref>{{cite web|title=Comparing Handle and Value Classes|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_oop/comparing-handle-and-value-classes.html|publisher=MathWorks}}</ref>\n\nMethod call behavior is different between value and reference classes. For example, a call to a method\n<source lang=\"matlab\">\nobject.method();\n</source>\ncan alter any member of ''object'' only if ''object'' is an instance of a reference class, otherwise value class methods must return a new instance if it needs to modify the object.\n\nAn example of a simple class is provided below.\n\n<source lang=\"matlab\">\nclassdef Hello\n    methods\n        function greet(obj)\n            disp('Hello!')\n        end\n    end\nend\n</source>\n\nWhen put into a file named <tt>hello.m</tt>, this can be executed with the following commands:\n<source lang=\"matlabsession\">\n>> x = Hello();\n>> x.greet();\nHello!\n</source>\n\n== Graphics and graphical user interface programming ==\n\n* <graph>{\n\t\"version\": 2,\n\t\"width\": 400,\n\t\"height\": 200,\n\t\"data\": [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"name\": \"table\",\n\t\t\t\"values\": [\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"x\": 3,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"y\": 1\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"x\": 1,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"y\": 3\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"x\": 2,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"y\": 2\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"x\": 3,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"y\": 4\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t]\n\t\t}\n\t],\n\t\"scales\": [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"name\": \"x\",\n\t\t\t\"type\": \"ordinal\",\n\t\t\t\"range\": \"width\",\n\t\t\t\"zero\": false,\n\t\t\t\"domain\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"data\": \"table\",\n\t\t\t\t\"field\": \"x\"\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"name\": \"y\",\n\t\t\t\"type\": \"linear\",\n\t\t\t\"range\": \"height\",\n\t\t\t\"nice\": true,\n\t\t\t\"domain\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"data\": \"table\",\n\t\t\t\t\"field\": \"y\"\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t],\n\t\"axes\": [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"type\": \"x\",\n\t\t\t\"scale\": \"x\"\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"type\": \"y\",\n\t\t\t\"scale\": \"y\"\n\t\t}\n\t],\n\t\"marks\": [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"type\": \"rect\",\n\t\t\t\"from\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"data\": \"table\"\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\"properties\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"enter\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\"x\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"scale\": \"x\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"field\": \"x\"\n\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\t\"y\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"scale\": \"y\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"field\": \"y\"\n\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\t\"y2\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"scale\": \"y\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"value\": 0\n\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\t\"fill\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"value\": \"steelblue\"\n\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\t\"width\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"scale\": \"x\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"band\": \"true\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"offset\": -1\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t]\n}</graph>\n\nMATLAB has tightly integrated graph-plotting features. For example, the function ''plot'' can be used to produce a graph from two vectors ''x'' and ''y''.

language|multi-paradigm]] [[numerical analysis|numerical computing]] environment and [[proprietary programming language]] developed by [[MathWorks]]. MATLAB allows [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] manipulations, plotting of [[function (mathematics)|functions]] and data, implementation of [[algorithm]]s, creation of [[user interface]]s, and interfacing with programs written in other languages.\n\nAlthough MATLAB is intended primarily for numerical computing, an optional toolbox uses the [[MuPAD]] [[computer algebra system|symbolic engine]] allowing access to [[symbolic computing]] abilities. An additional package, [[Simulink]], adds graphical multi-domain simulation and [[model-based design]] for [[dynamical system|dynamic]] and [[embedded system]]s.\n\nAs of 2018, MATLAB has more than 3 million users worldwide.<ref name=\"mathworksCompanyOverview\">{{cite web |url=https://www.mathworks.com/content/dam/mathworks/tag-team/Objects/c/company-fact-sheet-8282v18.pdf |title=Company Overview |author = The MathWorks |date=April 2018}}</ref> MATLAB users come from various backgrounds of [[engineering]], [[science]], and [[economics]].\n\n== History ==\n[[Cleve Moler]], the chairman of the [[computer science]] department at the [[University of New Mexico]], started developing MATLAB in the late 1970s.<ref name=\"origins\">{{cite web | url = http://www.mathworks.com/company/newsletters/articles/the-origins-of-matlab.html | title = The Origins of MATLAB| author = Cleve Moler | accessdate = April 15, 2007 |date=December 2004 }}</ref> He designed it to give his students access to [[LINPACK]] and [[EISPACK]] without them having to learn [[Fortran]]. It soon spread to other universities and found a strong audience within the [[applied mathematics]] community. [[John N. Little|Jack Little]], an engineer, was exposed to it during a visit Moler made to [[Stanford University]] in 1983. Recognizing its commercial potential, he joined with Moler and Steve Bangert. They rewrote MATLAB in [[C (programming language)|C]] and founded [[MathWorks]] in 1984 to continue its development. These rewritten libraries were known as JACKPAC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altiusdirectory.com/Computers/matlab-programming-language.php|title=MATLAB Programming Language|publisher=Altius Directory|accessdate=December 17, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103203721/http://www.altiusdirectory.com/Computers/matlab-programming-language.php|archive-date=January 3, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2000, MATLAB was rewritten to use a newer set of libraries for matrix manipulation, [[LAPACK]].<ref>{{cite web|title=MATLAB Incorporates LAPACK|url=http://www.mathworks.com/company/newsletters/articles/matlab-incorporates-lapack.html|work=Cleve's Corner|publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=December 20, 2008|first=Cleve |last=Moler|date=January 2000}}</ref>\n\nMATLAB was first adopted by researchers and practitioners in [[control engineering]], Little's specialty, but quickly spread to many other domains. It is now also used in education, in particular the teaching of [[linear algebra]] and [[numerical analysis]], and is popular amongst scientists involved in [[image processing]].<ref name=\"origins\" />\n\n== Syntax ==\nThe MATLAB application is built around the MATLAB programming language. Common usage of the MATLAB application involves using the \"Command Window\" as an interactive mathematical [[command line interface|shell]] or executing text files containing MATLAB code.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/index.html|title=MATLAB Documentation |publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Variables ===\nVariables are defined using the assignment operator, <code>=</code>. MATLAB is a [[Strong and weak typing|weakly typed]] programming language because types are implicitly converted.<ref>{{cite web|title=Comparing MATLAB with Other OO Languages|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_oop/matlab-vs-other-oo-languages.html|work=MATLAB|publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}</ref>  It is an inferred typed language because variables can be assigned without declaring their type, except if they are to be treated as symbolic objects,<ref>{{cite web|title=Create Symbolic Variables and Expressions|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/creating-symbolic-variables-and-expressions.html|work=Symbolic Math Toolbox|publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}</ref> and that their type can change. Values can come from [[constant (computer science)|constant]]s, from computation involving values of other variables, or from the output of a function. For example:\n<source lang=\"matlabsession\">\n>> x = 17\nx =\n 17\n\n>> x = 'hat'\nx =\nhat\n\n>> x = [3*4, pi/2]\nx =\n   12.0000    1.5708\n\n>> y = 3*sin(x)\ny =\n   -1.6097    3.0000\n</source>\n\n=== Vectors and matrices ===\nA simple array is defined using the colon syntax: ''initial''<code>:</code>''increment''<code>:</code>''terminator''. For instance:\n<source lang=\"matlab\">\n>> array = 1:2:9\narray =\n 1 3 5 7 9\n</source>\ndefines a variable named <code>array</code> (or assigns a new value to an existing variable with the name <code>array</code>) which is an array consisting of the values 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. That is, the array starts at 1 (the ''initial'' value), increments with each step from the previous value by 2 (the ''increment'' value), and stops once it reaches (or to avoid exceeding) 9 (the ''terminator'' value).\n<source lang=\"matlab\">\n>> array = 1:3:9\narray =\n 1 4 7\n</source>\nthe ''increment'' value can actually be left out of this syntax (along with one of the colons), to use a default value of 1.\n<source lang=\"matlab\">\n>> ari = 1:5\nari =\n 1 2 3 4 5\n</source>\nassigns to the variable named <code>ari</code> an array with the values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, since the default value of 1 is used as the increment.\n\n[[One-based indexing|Indexing]] is one-based,<ref>{{cite web|title=Matrix Indexing|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/math/matrix-indexing.html|publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}</ref> which is the usual convention for [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] in mathematics, unlike zero-based indexing commonly used in other programming languages such as C, C++, and Java.\n\nMatrices can be defined by separating the elements of a row with blank space or comma and using a semicolon to terminate each row. The list of elements should be surrounded by square brackets <code>[]</code>. Parentheses <code>()</code> are used to access elements and subarrays (they are also used to denote a function argument list).\n\n<source lang=\"matlab\">\n>> A = [16 3 2 13; 5 10 11 8; 9 6 7 12; 4 15 14 1]\nA =\n 16  3  2 13\n  5 10 11  8\n  9  6  7 12\n  4 15 14  1\n\n>> A(2,3)\nans =\n 11\n</source>\n\nSets of indices can be specified by expressions such as <code>2:4</code>, which evaluates to <code>[2, 3, 4]</code>.  For example, a submatrix taken from rows 2 through 4 and columns 3 through 4 can be written as:\n<source lang=\"matlab\">\n>> A(2:4,3:4)\nans =\n 11 8\n 7 12\n 14 1\n</source>\nA square [[identity matrix]] of size ''n'' can be generated using the function <code>eye</code>, and matrices of any size with zeros or ones can be generated with the functions <code>zeros</code> and <code>ones</code>, respectively.\n<source lang=\"matlab\">\n>> eye(3,3)\nans =\n 1 0 0\n 0 1 0\n 0 0 1\n\n>> zeros(2,3)\nans =\n 0 0 0\n 0 0 0\n\n>> ones(2,3)\nans =\n 1 1 1\n 1 1 1\n</source>\n\n[[Transpose|Transposing]] a vector or a matrix is done either by the function <code>transpose</code> or by adding dot-prime after the matrix (without the dot, prime will perform [[conjugate transpose]] for complex arrays):\n<source lang=\"matlab\">\n>> A = [1 ; 2],  B = A.', C = transpose(A)\nA =\n     1\n     2\nB =\n     1     2\nC =\n     1     2\n\n>> D = [0 3 ; 1 5], D.'\nD =\n     0     3\n     1     5\nans =\n     0     1\n     3     5\n</source>\n\nMost functions accept arrays as input and operate element-wise on each element. For example, <code>mod(2*J,n)</code> will multiply every element in ''J'' by 2, and then reduce each element modulo ''n''. MATLAB does include standard <code>for</code> and <code>while</code> loops, but (as in other similar applications such as [[R (programming language)|R]]), using the [[Array programming|vectorized]] notation is encouraged and is often faster to execute. The following code, excerpted from the function ''magic.m'', creates a [[magic square]] ''M'' for odd values of ''n'' (MATLAB function <code>meshgrid</code> is used here to generate square matrices ''I'' and ''J'' containing ''1:n'').\n\n<source lang=\"matlab\">\n[J,I] = meshgrid(1:n);\nA = mod(I + J - (n + 3) / 2, n);\nB = mod(I + 2 * J - 2, n);\nM = n * A + B + 1;\n</source>\n\n=== Structures ===\nMATLAB supports structure data types.<ref>{{cite web|title=Structures|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/structures.html|publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}</ref> Since all variables in MATLAB are arrays, a more adequate name is \"structure array\", where each element of the array has the same field names. In addition, MATLAB supports dynamic field names<ref>{{cite web|title=Generate Field Names from Variables|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/generate-field-names-from-variables.html|publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}</ref> (field look-ups by name, field manipulations, etc.).\n\n=== Functions ===\nWhen creating a MATLAB function, the name of the file should match the name of the first function in the file. Valid function names begin with an alphabetic character, and can contain letters, numbers, or underscores.  Variables and functions are case sensitive.<ref>{{cite web|title=Case and Space Sensitivity|url=https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/case-and-space-sensitivity.html|publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=November 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Function handles ===\nMATLAB supports elements of [[lambda calculus]] by introducing function handles,<ref>{{cite web|title=Function Handles|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/function-handles.html|publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}</ref> or function references, which are implemented either in .m files or anonymous<ref>{{cite web|title=Anonymous Functions|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/anonymous-functions.html|publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}</ref>/nested functions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nested Functions|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/nested-functions.html|publisher=MathWorks.}}</ref>\n\n=== Classes and object-oriented programming ===\nMATLAB supports [[object-oriented programming]] including classes, inheritance, virtual dispatch, packages, pass-by-value semantics, and pass-by-reference semantics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/object-oriented-programming.html |title=Object-Oriented Programming|publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}</ref> However, the syntax and calling conventions are significantly different from other languages. MATLAB has value classes and reference classes, depending on whether the class has ''handle'' as a super-class (for reference classes) or not (for value classes).<ref>{{cite web|title=Comparing Handle and Value Classes|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_oop/comparing-handle-and-value-classes.html|publisher=MathWorks}}</ref>\n\nMethod call behavior is different between value and reference classes. For example, a call to a method\n<source lang=\"matlab\">\nobject.method();\n</source>\ncan alter any member of ''object'' only if ''object'' is an instance of a reference class, otherwise value class methods must return a new instance if it needs to modify the object.\n\nAn example of a simple class is provided below.\n\n<source lang=\"matlab\">\nclassdef Hello\n    methods\n        function greet(obj)\n            disp('Hello!')\n        end\n    end\nend\n</source>\n\nWhen put into a file named <tt>hello.m</tt>, this can be executed with the following commands:\n<source lang=\"matlabsession\">\n>> x = Hello();\n>> x.greet();\nHello!\n</source>\n\n== Graphics and graphical user interface programming ==\n\n* <graph>{\n\t\"version\": 2,\n\t\"width\": 400,\n\t\"height\": 200,\n\t\"data\": [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"name\": \"table\",\n\t\t\t\"values\": [\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"x\": 3,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"y\": 1\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"x\": 1,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"y\": 3\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"x\": 2,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"y\": 2\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"x\": 3,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"y\": 4\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t]\n\t\t}\n\t],\n\t\"scales\": [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"name\": \"x\",\n\t\t\t\"type\": \"ordinal\",\n\t\t\t\"range\": \"width\",\n\t\t\t\"zero\": false,\n\t\t\t\"domain\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"data\": \"table\",\n\t\t\t\t\"field\": \"x\"\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"name\": \"y\",\n\t\t\t\"type\": \"linear\",\n\t\t\t\"range\": \"height\",\n\t\t\t\"nice\": true,\n\t\t\t\"domain\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"data\": \"table\",\n\t\t\t\t\"field\": \"y\"\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t],\n\t\"axes\": [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"type\": \"x\",\n\t\t\t\"scale\": \"x\"\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"type\": \"y\",\n\t\t\t\"scale\": \"y\"\n\t\t}\n\t],\n\t\"marks\": [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"type\": \"rect\",\n\t\t\t\"from\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"data\": \"table\"\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\"properties\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"enter\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\"x\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"scale\": \"x\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"field\": \"x\"\n\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\t\"y\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"scale\": \"y\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"field\": \"y\"\n\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\t\"y2\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"scale\": \"y\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"value\": 0\n\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\t\"fill\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"value\": \"steelblue\"\n\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\t\"width\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"scale\": \"x\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"band\": \"true\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"offset\": -1\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t]\n}</graph>\n\nMATLAB has tightly integrated graph-plotting features.
