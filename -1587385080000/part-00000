{"title_page": "Shredding (disassembling genomic data)", "text_new": "'''Shredding''' refers to the process in [[bioinformatics]] of taking assembled [[gene]] sequences and disassembling them into short sequences of usually 500 to 750 [[base pair]]s (bp). This is generally done for the purpose of taking the short ''shredded'' sequences and reapplying various analysis and bioinformatic techniques. Being able to cut [[DNA]] samples and then run them through gel electrophoresis to study each strand in order to help find cures for diseases or illnesses is also another purpose.\n\nThe most common tool or enzyme used to shred DNA into fragments is [[CAS9]]. This enzyme is able to cut DNA the exactly as wanted without making a mistake. There are also many other enzymes that help with shredding such as CASX or CAS3. CAS3 is a shredding tool but is not as accurate as CAS9 and may lead to random DNA strands being deleted.\n\n== History ==\n'''DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid)''' was first found by [[Rosalind Franklin]]. She discovered that DNA exists in species by taking multiple x-rays until she found an \"X\" looking diagram. She did not actually know much about it other than it exists. She died a few years later due to a massive amount of exposure to x-rays. [[James Watson]] and [[Francis Cricket]] then used Rosalind's discovery and looked further into it. They discovered the structure of DNA. They were the first to know that DNA has a double helix after the analysis of the x-rays.\n\nWith time, DNA fragments were discovered. They first studied DNA on very simplistic organisms. This is because the human DNA strand is very complex compared to an organism like a fruit fly, which has much simpler genes. The scientists did various experiments using simplistic genes and worked their way into much harder genes. They did various cutting to specific genes to see what would occur. <gallery>\nFile:DNA orbit animated.gif|The structure of DNA years after its discovery by Rosalind Franklin.\n</gallery>\n\n==Human Genome Project==\n<gallery>\nFile:Human genome to genes.png|'''Genomes to chromosomes and from chromosomes to genes'''\n</gallery>The process of shredding was used successfully several times during the analysis phase of the [[human genome project]].<ref>Venter, C.

She is internationally famous as a spokesperson on autism as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.apbspeakers.com/speaker/temple-grandin |title=Temple Grandin |work=apbspeakers.com |access-date=April 14, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Autism spectrum===\n[[Steve Silberman]] in his book, ''[[Neurotribes|NeuroTribes]]'', wrote that Temple Grandin helped break down years of shame and stigma because she was one of the first adults to publicly disclose that she was autistic. [[Bernard Rimland]], a father of a son with autism and author of the book, ''Infantile Autism'', wrote the foreword to Grandin's first book ''Emergence: Labeled Autistic''. Her book was published in 1986. Dr. Rimland wrote \"Temple's ability to convey to the reader her innermost feelings and fears, coupled with her capacity for explaining mental processes will give the reader an insight into autism that very few have been able to achieve.\"\n\nIn her later book, ''[[Thinking in Pictures]]'', published in 1995, the neurologist [[Oliver Sacks]] wrote at the end of the foreword that the book provided \"a bridge between our world and hers, and allows us to glimpse into a quite other sort of mind.\"\n\nIn her early writings, Grandin characterized herself as a recovered autistic and, in his foreword, [[Bernard Rimland]] used the term recovered autistic individual. In her later writings she has abandoned this characterization. Steve Silberman wrote, \"It became obvious to her, however, that she was not recovered but had learned with great effort to adapt to the social norms of the people around her.\"\n\nWhen her book ''Thinking in Pictures'' was written in 1995, Grandin thought that all individuals with autism thought in photographic-specific images the way she did. By the time the expanded edition was published in 2006, she had realized that it had been wrong to presume that every person with autism processed information in the same way she did. In the 2006 edition, she wrote that there were three types of specialized thinking. They were:  1. Visual Thinkers like she is, who think in photographically-specific images. 2. Music and Math Thinkers \u2013 who think in patterns and may be good at mathematics, chess, and programming computers. 3. Verbal Logic Thinkers \u2013 who think in word details, and she noted that their favorite subject may be history.\n\nIn one of her later books, ''The Autistic Brain: Thinking Across the Spectrum'', the concept of three different types of thinking by autistic individuals is expanded. This book was published in 2013. An influential book that helped her to develop her concept of pattern thinking was [[Clara Claiborne Park]]'s book entitled, ''Exiting Nirvana: A Daughter's Life with Autism''. It was published in 2001. ''The Autistic Brain'' also contains an extensive review of scientific studies that provide evidence that object-visual thinking is different from spatial-visualization abilities.\n\nGrandin became well-known beyond the American autistic community, after being described by [[Oliver Sacks]] in the title narrative of his book, ''[[An Anthropologist on Mars]]'' (1995), for which he won a [[Polk Award]]. The title is derived from Grandin's characterization of how she feels around [[neurotypical]] people. In the mid-1980s Grandin first spoke in public about autism at the request of [[Ruth C. Sullivan]], one of the founders of the [[Autism Society of America]] (ASA). Sullivan writes:\n{{cquote|I first met Temple in the mid-1980s [at the] annual [ASA] conference. Standing on the periphery of the group was a tall young woman who was obviously interested in the discussions. She seemed shy and pleasant, but mostly she just listened. I learned her name was Temple Grandin. It wasn't until later in the week that I realized she was someone with autism. I approached her and asked if she'd be willing to speak at the next year's [ASA] conference. She agreed. The next year Temple first addressed an [ASA] audience. People were standing at least three deep. The audience couldn't get enough of her. Here, for the first time, was someone who could tell us from her own experience, what it was like to be extremely sound sensitive (\"like being tied to the rail and the train's coming\"). She was asked many questions: \"Why does my son do so much spinning?\" \"Why does he hold his hands to his ears?\" \"Why doesn't he look at me?\" She spoke from her own experience, and her insight was impressive. There were tears in more than one set of eyes that day. Temple quickly became a much sought-after speaker in the autism community.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=adPodg5MNU0C&pg=PR13&lpg=PR13&dq=temple+grandin+ruth+sullivan#v=onepage&q=temple%20grandin%20ruth%20sullivan&f=false |title=The Way I See It: A Personal Look at Autism and Aspberger's |first=Temple |last=Grandin |publisher=Future Horizons |year=2008 |isbn=9781932565720 |access-date=April 14, 2019}}</ref>}}\n\nBased on personal experience, Grandin advocates early intervention to address autism and supportive teachers, who can direct fixations of the child with autism in fruitful directions. She has described her [[Sensitivity (human)|hypersensitivity]] to noise and other sensory stimuli. She says words are her second language and that she thinks \"totally in pictures\", using her vast visual memory to translate information into a mental slideshow of images that may be manipulated or correlated.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Temple |last=Grandin |title=How does visual thinking work in the mind of a person with autism?

Grandin compares her memory to full-length movies in her head, that may be replayed at will, allowing her to notice small details. She also is able to view her memories using slightly different contexts by changing the positions of the lighting and shadows.\n\nAs a proponent of [[neurodiversity]], Grandin does not support eliminating autism genes or treating mildly-autistic individuals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.edge.org/response-detail/27221|title=Edge.org|website=www.edge.org|access-date=2019-08-17}}</ref> However, she believes that autistic children who are severely handicapped need therapy with [[applied behavioral analysis]].<ref name=\"wrongplanet\" /> Additionally, she has claimed that she only will attend talks given by autistics who can hold down a career.<ref name=\"ArtAutism\">{{cite web |last=Sandison |first=Ron |title=Temple Grandin To Autistic Adults: Get Your Butts Out Of The House And Get A Job |url=https://the-art-of-autism.com/temple-grandin-to-autistic-adults-get-your-butts-out-of-the-house-and-get-a-job/ |website=The Art of Autism |date=April 13, 2017 |access-date=April 14, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Handling livestock===\nIn 1980 Grandin published her first two scientific articles on beef cattle behavior during handling: \"Livestock Behavior as Related to Handling Facilities Design\" in the ''International Journal for the Study of Animal Problems, Vol. 1, pp. 33-52'' and \"Observations of Cattle Behavior Applied to the Design of Cattle Handling Facilities\", ''Applied Animal Ethology, Vol. 6, pp. 19-31.'' She was one of the first scientists to report that animals are sensitive to visual distractions in handling facilities such as shadows, dangling chains, and other environmental details that most people do not notice. When she was awarded her Ph.D. at the University of Illinois, she studied the effects of environmental enrichment on pigs. The title of her [[Thesis|dissertation]] was \"Effect of Rearing Environment and Environmental Enrichment on the Behavior and Neural Development in Young Pigs\". Grandin expanded her theories in her book, ''Animals Make Us Human''.\n\nIn 1993, she edited the first edition of ''Livestock Handling and Transport''. Grandin wrote three chapters and included chapters from contributors from around the world. Subsequent editions of the book were published in 2000, 2007, and 2014. In her academic work as a professor at Colorado State University, her graduate student, Bridgett Voisinet, conducted one of the early studies that demonstrated that cattle who remained calm during handling, had higher weight gains. In 1997, when the paper was published, this was a new concept. The paper is entitled, \"Feedlot Cattle with Calm Temperaments Have Higher Average Daily Gains Than Cattle with Excitable Temperaments\", published in ''The Journal of Animal Science, Vol. 75, pp. 892-896.''\n\nAnother important paper published by Grandin was, \"Assessment of Stress During Handling and Transport\", ''Journal of Animal Science, 1997, Vol. 75, pp. 249-257''. This paper presented the concept that an animal's previous experiences with handling could have an effect on how it will react to being handled in the future, as a new concept in the animal-handling industry.\n\nA major piece of equipment that Grandin developed was a center track (double rail) conveyor restrainer system for holding cattle during stunning at large beef slaughtering plants. The first system was installed in the mid-1980s for calves and a system for large beef cattle was developed in 1990. This equipment is now being used by many large meat companies. It is described in \"Double Rail Restrainer Conveyor for Livestock Handling\", first published in the ''Journal of Agricultural Engineering Research, Vol. 4, pp. 327-338'' in 1988, and \"Transferring results of behavioral research to industry to improve animal welfare on the farm, ranch, and slaughter plant\", ''Applied Animal Behavior Science, Vol. 8, pp. 215-228'', published in 2003.\n\nGrandin also developed an objective, numerical scoring system for assessing animal welfare at [[Slaughterhouse|slaughtering plants]]. The use of this scoring system resulted in significant improvements in animal stunning and handling during slaughter. This work is described in \"Objective scoring of animal handling and stunning practices in slaughter plants\", ''[[American Veterinary Medical Association|Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association]], Vol. 212, pp. 36-39, \"The feasibility of using vocalization scoring as an indicator of poor welfare during slaughter\", ''Applied Animal Behavior Science, Vol. 56, pp.&nbsp;121\u2013128,'' and \"Effect of animal welfare audits of slaughter plants by a major fast food company on cattle handling and stunning practices\", ''Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association, Vol. 216, pp.&nbsp;848\u2013851.\n\nIn 2008, Grandin published ''Humane Livestock Handling''<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/humanelivestockh0000gran|title=Humane livestock handling|last=Grandin, Temple.|date=2008|publisher=Storey Pub|others=Deesing, Mark.|isbn=9781603420280|location=North Adams, MA|oclc=176902393|url-access=registration}}</ref> with contributions by Mark Deesing, a long time collaborator with her. The book contains a review of the main aspects of cattle behavior and provides a visual guide in the form of construction plans and diagrams for the implementation of Grandin's ideas relating to humane livestock handling.\n\n===Other scientific contributions===\nGrandin is the author or co-author of more than 60 peer-reviewed scientific papers on a variety of other animal behavior subjects. Some of the other subjects are: the effect of hair whorl position on cattle behavior, the influence of stress prior to slaughter upon meat quality, religious slaughter, mothering behavior of beef cows, cattle temperament, and causes of bruising.\n\n===Animal welfare===\nGrandin has lectured widely about her first-hand experiences of the anxiety of feeling threatened by everything in her surroundings, and of being dismissed and feared, which motivates her work in humane livestock handling processes. She studied the behavior of cattle, how they react to ranchers, movements, objects, and light. Grandin then designed curved corrals she adapted with the intention of reducing stress, panic, and injury in animals being led to [[Animal slaughter|slaughter]]. This has proved to be a further point of criticism and controversy among animal activists who have questioned the congruence of a career built on animal slaughter alongside Grandin's claims of compassion and respect for animals. While her designs are widely used throughout the slaughterhouse industry, her claim of compassion for the animals is that because of her autism she can see the animals' reality from their viewpoint, that when she holds an animal's head in her hands as it is being slaughtered, she feels a deep connection to them.<ref>{{cite book |last=Coe |first=Sue |title=Cruel: bearing witness to animal exploitation. |date=2012 |publisher=OR Books |location=New York |isbn=978-1-935928-72-0 |page=64}}</ref>\n\nHer business website promotes improvement of standards for [[slaughterhouse]]s and livestock farms.

She compares the properties and rights of owning cattle, versus owning screwdrivers, enumerating how both may be used to serve human purposes in many ways, but when it comes to inflicting pain, there is a vital distinction between such \"properties\", because legally, a person can smash or grind up a screwdriver, but cannot [[torture]] an animal.\n\nHer insight into the minds of cattle has taught her to value the changes in details to which animals are particularly sensitive and to use her visualization skills to design thoughtful and humane animal-handling equipment. She was named a fellow of the [[American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers]] in 2009.<ref>{{cite web |title=ASABE Fellows |url=http://www.asabe.org/media/199220/fellows_citations_since_97_for_website.pdf |publisher=American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (ASABE) |access-date=April 14, 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171030144237/http://www.asabe.org/media/199220/fellows_citations_since_97_for_website.pdf |archive-date=October 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, when the American beef industry was struggling with public perception of its use and sale of [[pink slime]], Grandin spoke out in support of the food product.

For example, when Grandin was facing criticism for her hug box at [[Franklin Pierce University|Franklin Pierce College]], it was Carlock who suggested that Grandin undertake scientific experiments to evaluate the efficacy of the device.<ref name=\"testsite\" /> It was his constant guidance to Grandin to refocus the rigid obsessions she experienced with the hug box into a productive assignment, that subsequently, allowed this study undertaken by Grandin to be widely cited as evidence of Grandin's resourcefulness.\n\n===High school education===\nAfter she graduated from [[Hampshire Country School|Mountain Country School]] in 1966, Grandin went on to earn her [[bachelor's degree]] in human [[psychology]] from [[Franklin Pierce University|Franklin Pierce College]] in 1970, a [[master's degree]] in [[animal science]] from [[Arizona State University]] in 1975, and a [[doctoral degree]] in animal science from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]] in 1989.\n\n==Career==\nGrandin is a prominent and widely-cited proponent for the humane treatment of livestock for slaughter. She is internationally famous as a spokesperson on autism as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.apbspeakers.com/speaker/temple-grandin |title=Temple Grandin |work=apbspeakers.com |access-date=April 14, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Autism spectrum===\n[[Steve Silberman]] in his book, ''[[Neurotribes|NeuroTribes]]'', wrote that Temple Grandin helped break down years of shame and stigma because she was one of the first adults to publicly disclose that she was autistic. [[Bernard Rimland]], a father of a son with autism and author of the book, ''Infantile Autism'', wrote the foreword to Grandin's first book ''Emergence: Labeled Autistic''. Her book was published in 1986. Dr. Rimland wrote \"Temple's ability to convey to the reader her innermost feelings and fears, coupled with her capacity for explaining mental processes will give the reader an insight into autism that very few have been able to achieve.\"\n\nIn her later book, ''[[Thinking in Pictures]]'', published in 1995, the neurologist [[Oliver Sacks]] wrote at the end of the foreword that the book provided \"a bridge between our world and hers, and allows us to glimpse into a quite other sort of mind.\"\n\nIn her early writings, Grandin characterized herself as a recovered autistic and, in his foreword, [[Bernard Rimland]] used the term recovered autistic individual. In her later writings she has abandoned this characterization. Steve Silberman wrote, \"It became obvious to her, however, that she was not recovered but had learned with great effort to adapt to the social norms of the people around her.\"\n\nWhen her book ''Thinking in Pictures'' was written in 1995, Grandin thought that all individuals with autism thought in photographic-specific images the way she did. By the time the expanded edition was published in 2006, she had realized that it had been wrong to presume that every person with autism processed information in the same way she did. In the 2006 edition, she wrote that there were three types of specialized thinking. They were:  1. Visual Thinkers like she is, who think in photographically-specific images. 2. Music and Math Thinkers \u2013 who think in patterns and may be good at mathematics, chess, and programming computers. 3. Verbal Logic Thinkers \u2013 who think in word details, and she noted that their favorite subject may be history.\n\nIn one of her later books, ''The Autistic Brain: Thinking Across the Spectrum'', the concept of three different types of thinking by autistic individuals is expanded. This book was published in 2013. An influential book that helped her to develop her concept of pattern thinking was [[Clara Claiborne Park]]'s book entitled, ''Exiting Nirvana: A Daughter's Life with Autism''. It was published in 2001. ''The Autistic Brain'' also contains an extensive review of scientific studies that provide evidence that object-visual thinking is different from spatial-visualization abilities.\n\nGrandin became well-known beyond the American autistic community, after being described by [[Oliver Sacks]] in the title narrative of his book, ''[[An Anthropologist on Mars]]'' (1995), for which he won a [[Polk Award]]. The title is derived from Grandin's characterization of how she feels around [[neurotypical]] people. In the mid-1980s Grandin first spoke in public about autism at the request of [[Ruth C. Sullivan]], one of the founders of the [[Autism Society of America]] (ASA). Sullivan writes:\n{{cquote|I first met Temple in the mid-1980s [at the] annual [ASA] conference. Standing on the periphery of the group was a tall young woman who was obviously interested in the discussions. She seemed shy and pleasant, but mostly she just listened. I learned her name was Temple Grandin. It wasn't until later in the week that I realized she was someone with autism. I approached her and asked if she'd be willing to speak at the next year's [ASA] conference. She agreed. The next year Temple first addressed an [ASA] audience. People were standing at least three deep. The audience couldn't get enough of her. Here, for the first time, was someone who could tell us from her own experience, what it was like to be extremely sound sensitive (\"like being tied to the rail and the train's coming\"). She was asked many questions: \"Why does my son do so much spinning?\" \"Why does he hold his hands to his ears?\" \"Why doesn't he look at me?\" She spoke from her own experience, and her insight was impressive. There were tears in more than one set of eyes that day. Temple quickly became a much sought-after speaker in the autism community.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=adPodg5MNU0C&pg=PR13&lpg=PR13&dq=temple+grandin+ruth+sullivan#v=onepage&q=temple%20grandin%20ruth%20sullivan&f=false |title=The Way I See It: A Personal Look at Autism and Aspberger's |first=Temple |last=Grandin |publisher=Future Horizons |year=2008 |isbn=9781932565720 |access-date=April 14, 2019}}</ref>}}\n\nBased on personal experience, Grandin advocates early intervention to address autism and supportive teachers, who can direct fixations of the child with autism in fruitful directions. She has described her [[Sensitivity (human)|hypersensitivity]] to noise and other sensory stimuli. She says words are her second language and that she thinks \"totally in pictures\", using her vast visual memory to translate information into a mental slideshow of images that may be manipulated or correlated.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Temple |last=Grandin |title=How does visual thinking work in the mind of a person with autism?

Grandin compares her memory to full-length movies in her head, that may be replayed at will, allowing her to notice small details. She also is able to view her memories using slightly different contexts by changing the positions of the lighting and shadows.\n\nAs a proponent of [[neurodiversity]], Grandin does not support eliminating autism genes or treating mildly-autistic individuals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.edge.org/response-detail/27221|title=Edge.org|website=www.edge.org|access-date=2019-08-17}}</ref> However, she believes that autistic children who are severely handicapped need therapy with [[applied behavioral analysis]].<ref name=\"wrongplanet\" /> Additionally, she has claimed that she only will attend talks given by autistics who can hold down a career.<ref name=\"ArtAutism\">{{cite web |last=Sandison |first=Ron |title=Temple Grandin To Autistic Adults: Get Your Butts Out Of The House And Get A Job |url=https://the-art-of-autism.com/temple-grandin-to-autistic-adults-get-your-butts-out-of-the-house-and-get-a-job/ |website=The Art of Autism |date=April 13, 2017 |access-date=April 14, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Handling livestock===\nIn 1980 Grandin published her first two scientific articles on beef cattle behavior during handling: \"Livestock Behavior as Related to Handling Facilities Design\" in the ''International Journal for the Study of Animal Problems, Vol. 1, pp. 33-52'' and \"Observations of Cattle Behavior Applied to the Design of Cattle Handling Facilities\", ''Applied Animal Ethology, Vol. 6, pp. 19-31.'' She was one of the first scientists to report that animals are sensitive to visual distractions in handling facilities such as shadows, dangling chains, and other environmental details that most people do not notice. When she was awarded her Ph.D. at the University of Illinois, she studied the effects of environmental enrichment on pigs. The title of her [[Thesis|dissertation]] was \"Effect of Rearing Environment and Environmental Enrichment on the Behavior and Neural Development in Young Pigs\". Grandin expanded her theories in her book, ''Animals Make Us Human''.\n\nIn 1993, she edited the first edition of ''Livestock Handling and Transport''. Grandin wrote three chapters and included chapters from contributors from around the world. Subsequent editions of the book were published in 2000, 2007, and 2014. In her academic work as a professor at Colorado State University, her graduate student, Bridgett Voisinet, conducted one of the early studies that demonstrated that cattle who remained calm during handling, had higher weight gains. In 1997, when the paper was published, this was a new concept. The paper is entitled, \"Feedlot Cattle with Calm Temperaments Have Higher Average Daily Gains Than Cattle with Excitable Temperaments\", published in ''The Journal of Animal Science, Vol. 75, pp. 892-896.''\n\nAnother important paper published by Grandin was, \"Assessment of Stress During Handling and Transport\", ''Journal of Animal Science, 1997, Vol. 75, pp. 249-257''. This paper presented the concept that an animal's previous experiences with handling could have an effect on how it will react to being handled in the future, as a new concept in the animal-handling industry.\n\nA major piece of equipment that Grandin developed was a center track (double rail) conveyor restrainer system for holding cattle during stunning at large beef slaughtering plants. The first system was installed in the mid-1980s for calves and a system for large beef cattle was developed in 1990. This equipment is now being used by many large meat companies. It is described in \"Double Rail Restrainer Conveyor for Livestock Handling\", first published in the ''Journal of Agricultural Engineering Research, Vol. 4, pp. 327-338'' in 1988, and \"Transferring results of behavioral research to industry to improve animal welfare on the farm, ranch, and slaughter plant\", ''Applied Animal Behavior Science, Vol. 8, pp. 215-228'', published in 2003.\n\nGrandin also developed an objective, numerical scoring system for assessing animal welfare at [[Slaughterhouse|slaughtering plants]]. The use of this scoring system resulted in significant improvements in animal stunning and handling during slaughter. This work is described in \"Objective scoring of animal handling and stunning practices in slaughter plants\", ''[[American Veterinary Medical Association|Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association]], Vol. 212, pp. 36-39, \"The feasibility of using vocalization scoring as an indicator of poor welfare during slaughter\", ''Applied Animal Behavior Science, Vol. 56, pp.&nbsp;121\u2013128,'' and \"Effect of animal welfare audits of slaughter plants by a major fast food company on cattle handling and stunning practices\", ''Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association, Vol. 216, pp.&nbsp;848\u2013851.\n\nIn 2008, Grandin published ''Humane Livestock Handling''<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/humanelivestockh0000gran|title=Humane livestock handling|last=Grandin, Temple.|date=2008|publisher=Storey Pub|others=Deesing, Mark.|isbn=9781603420280|location=North Adams, MA|oclc=176902393|url-access=registration}}</ref> with contributions by Mark Deesing, a long time collaborator with her. The book contains a review of the main aspects of cattle behavior and provides a visual guide in the form of construction plans and diagrams for the implementation of Grandin's ideas relating to humane livestock handling.\n\n===Other scientific contributions===\nGrandin is the author or co-author of more than 60 peer-reviewed scientific papers on a variety of other animal behavior subjects. Some of the other subjects are: the effect of hair whorl position on cattle behavior, the influence of stress prior to slaughter upon meat quality, religious slaughter, mothering behavior of beef cows, cattle temperament, and causes of bruising.\n\n===Animal welfare===\nGrandin has lectured widely about her first-hand experiences of the anxiety of feeling threatened by everything in her surroundings, and of being dismissed and feared, which motivates her work in humane livestock handling processes. She studied the behavior of cattle, how they react to ranchers, movements, objects, and light. Grandin then designed curved corrals she adapted with the intention of reducing stress, panic, and injury in animals being led to [[Animal slaughter|slaughter]]. This has proved to be a further point of criticism and controversy among animal activists who have questioned the congruence of a career built on animal slaughter alongside Grandin's claims of compassion and respect for animals. While her designs are widely used throughout the slaughterhouse industry, her claim of compassion for the animals is that because of her autism she can see the animals' reality from their viewpoint, that when she holds an animal's head in her hands as it is being slaughtered, she feels a deep connection to them.<ref>{{cite book |last=Coe |first=Sue |title=Cruel: bearing witness to animal exploitation. |date=2012 |publisher=OR Books |location=New York |isbn=978-1-935928-72-0 |page=64}}</ref>\n\nHer business website promotes improvement of standards for [[slaughterhouse]]s and livestock farms.

She compares the properties and rights of owning cattle, versus owning screwdrivers, enumerating how both may be used to serve human purposes in many ways, but when it comes to inflicting pain, there is a vital distinction between such \"properties\", because legally, a person can smash or grind up a screwdriver, but cannot [[torture]] an animal.\n\nHer insight into the minds of cattle has taught her to value the changes in details to which animals are particularly sensitive and to use her visualization skills to design thoughtful and humane animal-handling equipment. She was named a fellow of the [[American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers]] in 2009.<ref>{{cite web |title=ASABE Fellows |url=http://www.asabe.org/media/199220/fellows_citations_since_97_for_website.pdf |publisher=American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (ASABE) |access-date=April 14, 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171030144237/http://www.asabe.org/media/199220/fellows_citations_since_97_for_website.pdf |archive-date=October 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, when the American beef industry was struggling with public perception of its use and sale of [[pink slime]], Grandin spoke out in support of the food product.
