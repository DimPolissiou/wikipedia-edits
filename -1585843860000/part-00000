The policies are implemented to promote national energy independence, high tech job creation and reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Three incentive mechanisms are often used in combination as investment subsidies: the authorities refund part of the cost of installation of the system, the electricity utility buys PV electricity from the producer under a multiyear contract at a guaranteed rate, and [[Solar Renewable Energy Certificates]] (SRECs)\n\n==== Rebates ====\n\nWith investment subsidies, the financial burden falls upon the taxpayer, while with feed-in tariffs the extra cost is distributed across the utilities' customer bases. While the investment subsidy may be simpler to administer, the main argument in favour of feed-in tariffs is the encouragement of quality. Investment subsidies are paid out as a function of the nameplate capacity of the installed system and are independent of its actual power yield over time, thus rewarding the overstatement of power and tolerating poor durability and maintenance. Some electric companies offer rebates to their customers, such as [[Austin Energy]] in [[Texas]], which offers $2.50/watt installed up to $15,000.<ref>[http://www.austinenergy.com/Energy%20Efficiency/Programs/Rebates/Solar%20Rebates/index.htm Solar Rebate Program] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725015516/http://www.austinenergy.com/Energy%20Efficiency/Programs/Rebates/Solar%20Rebates/index.htm |date=25 July 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==== Net metering ====\n[[File:Feed-in Tariff meter connections.png|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Net metering]], unlike a [[feed-in tariff]], requires only one meter, but it must be bi-directional.]]\n\nIn [[net metering]] the price of the electricity produced is the same as the price supplied to the consumer, and the consumer is billed on the difference between production and consumption. Net metering can usually be done with no changes to standard [[electricity meter]]s, which accurately measure power in both directions and automatically report the difference, and because it allows homeowners and businesses to generate electricity at a different time from consumption, effectively using the grid as a giant storage battery. With net metering, deficits are billed each month while surpluses are rolled over to the following month. Best practices call for perpetual roll over of kWh credits.<ref>[http://www.dsireusa.org/solar/solarpolicyguide/?id=17 Net Metering] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021172839/http://www.dsireusa.org/solar/solarpolicyguide/?id=17 |date=21 October 2012 }}</ref> Excess credits upon termination of service are either lost or paid for at a rate ranging from wholesale to retail rate or above, as can be excess annual credits.

They reward the number of kilowatt-hours produced over a long period of time, but because the rate is set by the authorities, it may result in perceived overpayment. The price paid per kilowatt-hour under a feed-in tariff exceeds the price of grid electricity. Net metering refers to the case where the price paid by the utility is the same as the price charged.\n\nThe complexity of approvals in California, Spain and Italy has prevented comparable growth to Germany even though the return on investment is better.{{citation needed|date = June 2015}} In some countries, additional incentives are offered for [[building-integrated photovoltaics]] (BIPV) compared to stand alone PV.\n* France + EUR 0.16 /kWh (compared to semi-integrated) or + EUR 0.27/kWh (compared to stand alone)\n* Italy + EUR 0.04\u20130.09 kWh\n* Germany + EUR 0.05/kWh (facades only)\n\n==== Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs) ====\n\nAlternatively, [[Solar Renewable Energy Certificate]]s (SRECs) allow for a market mechanism to set the price of the solar-generated electricity subsidy. In this mechanism, renewable energy production or consumption target is set, and the utility (more technically the Load Serving Entity) is obliged to purchase renewable energy or face a fine (Alternative Compliance Payment or ACP). The producer is credited for an SREC for every 1,000&nbsp;kWh of electricity produced. If the utility buys this SREC and retires it, they avoid paying the ACP. In principle, this system delivers the cheapest renewable energy since all solar facilities are eligible and can be installed in most economic locations. Uncertainties about the future value of SRECs have led to long-term SREC contract markets to give clarity to their prices and allow solar developers to pre-sell and hedge their credits.\n\nFinancial incentives for photovoltaics differ across countries, including [[Solar power in Australia|Australia]], [[Solar power in China|China]],<ref>[https://www.cnbc.com/id/32551044/site/14081545 China Racing Ahead of America in the Drive to Go Solar]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130706133417/http://www.cnbc.com/id/32551044/site/14081545 |date=6 July 2013 }}</ref> [[Solar power in Germany|Germany]],<ref name=\"German PV market\">{{cite web|url=http://www.solarbuzz.com/FastFactsGermany.htm|title=Power & Energy Technology - IHS Technology|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102171748/http://solarbuzz.com/FastFactsGermany.htm|archive-date=2 January 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Solar power in Israel|Israel]],<ref>[http://www.eng.shirasol.co.il/Approved-Feed-in-tariff-in-Israel.htm Approved \u2014 Feed-in tariff in Israel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603195611/http://eng.shirasol.co.il/Approved-Feed-in-tariff-in-Israel.htm |date=3 June 2009 }}.</ref> [[Solar power in Japan|Japan]], and the [[Solar power in the United States|United States]] and even across states within the US.\n\nThe Japanese government through its [[Ministry of International Trade and Industry]] ran a successful programme of subsidies from 1994 to 2003. By the end of 2004, Japan led the world in installed PV capacity with over 1.1&nbsp;[[Gigawatt|GW]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070208104905/http://www.oja-services.nl/iea-pvps/isr/22.htm]</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the German government introduced the first large-scale feed-in tariff system, under the [[German Renewable Energy Act]], which resulted in an explosive growth of PV installations in Germany. At the outset, the FIT was over 3x the retail price or 8x the industrial price. The principle behind the German system is a 20-year flat rate contract. The value of new contracts is programmed to decrease each year, in order to encourage the industry to pass on lower costs to the end-users. The programme has been more successful than expected with over 1GW installed in 2006, and political pressure is mounting to decrease the tariff to lessen the future burden on consumers.\n\nSubsequently, [[Solar power in Spain|Spain]], [[Solar power in Italy|Italy]], [[Solar power in Greece|Greece]]\u2014that enjoyed an early success with domestic solar-thermal installations for hot water needs\u2014and [[Solar power in France|France]] introduced feed-in tariffs. None have replicated the programmed decrease of FIT in new contracts though, making the German incentive relatively less and less attractive compared to other countries. The French and Greek FIT offer a high premium (EUR 0.55/kWh) for building integrated systems. California, Greece, France and Italy have 30\u201350% more insolation than Germany making them financially more attractive. The Greek domestic \"solar roof\" programme (adopted in June 2009 for installations up to 10&nbsp;kW) has internal rates of return of 10\u201315% at current commercial installation costs, which, furthermore, is tax-free.\n\nIn 2006 [[Solar power in California|California]] approved the '[[California Solar Initiative]]', offering a choice of investment subsidies or FIT for small and medium systems and a FIT for large systems. The small-system FIT of $0.39 per kWh (far less than EU countries) expires in just 5 years, and the alternate \"EPBB\" residential investment incentive is modest, averaging perhaps 20% of the cost. All California incentives are scheduled to decrease in the future depending as a function of the amount of PV capacity installed.\n\nAt the end of 2006, the Ontario Power Authority (OPA, Canada) began its Standard Offer Program, a precursor to the [[Green Energy Act 2009|Green Energy Act]], and the first in North America for distributed renewable projects of less than 10&nbsp; MW. The feed-in tariff guaranteed a fixed price of $0.42 CDN per kWh over a period of twenty years.

Both solar power and [[wind power]] are [[variable renewable energy]], meaning that all available output must be taken whenever it is available by moving through [[Electric power transmission|transmission]] lines to ''where it can be used now''. Since solar energy is not available at night, storing its energy is potentially an important issue particularly in off-grid and for future [[100% renewable energy]] scenarios to have continuous electricity availability.<ref>Carr (1976), p. 85</ref>\n\nSolar electricity is inherently variable and predictable by time of day, location, and seasons. In addition, solar is intermittent due to day/night cycles and unpredictable weather. How much of a special challenge solar power is in any given electric utility varies significantly. In a [[summer peak]] utility, solar is well matched to daytime cooling demands. In [[winter peak]] utilities, solar displaces other forms of generation, reducing their [[capacity factor]]s.\n\nIn an electricity system without [[grid energy storage]], generation from stored fuels (coal, biomass, natural gas, nuclear) must go up and down in reaction to the rise and fall of solar electricity (see [[load following power plant]]). While hydroelectric and natural gas plants can quickly respond to changes in load, coal, biomass and nuclear plants usually take considerable time to respond to load and can only be scheduled to follow the predictable variation. Depending on local circumstances, beyond about 20\u201340% of total generation, grid-connected [[intermittent energy source|intermittent source]]s like solar tend to require investment in some combination of [[Super grid|grid interconnections]], [[Grid energy storage|energy storage]] or [[Energy demand management|demand side management]]. Integrating large amounts of solar power with existing generation equipment has caused issues in some cases. For example, in Germany, California and Hawaii, electricity prices have been known to go negative when solar is generating a lot of power, displacing existing [[baseload]] generation contracts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/california-sun-solar-power-electricity-energy-prices-negative-renewables-green-climate-change-fossil-a7678086.html|title=California produced so much solar power, electricity prices just turned negative|author=|date=11 April 2017|website=independent.co.uk|access-date=30 April 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171211175722/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/california-sun-solar-power-electricity-energy-prices-negative-renewables-green-climate-change-fossil-a7678086.html|archive-date=11 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/plugged-in/3-reasons-hawaii-put-the-brakes-on-solar-and-why-the-same-won-t-happen-in-your-state/|title=3 Reasons Hawaii Put the Brakes on Solar--and Why the Same Won't Happen in Your State|first=Robert|last=Fares|date=|website=scientificamerican.com|access-date=30 April 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920121552/http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/plugged-in/3-reasons-hawaii-put-the-brakes-on-solar-and-why-the-same-won-t-happen-in-your-state/|archive-date=20 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nConventional hydroelectricity works very well in conjunction with solar power; water can be held back or released from a reservoir as required. Where a suitable river is not available, [[pumped-storage hydroelectricity]] uses solar power to pump water to a high reservoir on sunny days, then the energy is recovered at night and in bad weather by releasing water via a hydroelectric plant to a low reservoir where the cycle can begin again.<ref>{{cite web |title=Pumped Hydro Storage  |publisher=Electricity Storage Association  |url=http://www.electricitystorage.org/tech/technologies_technologies_pumpedhydro.htm  |access-date=31 July 2008  |url-status=dead  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621052054/http://www.electricitystorage.org/tech/technologies_technologies_pumpedhydro.htm  |archive-date=21 June 2008  |df=dmy }}</ref> \nThis cycle can lose 20% of the energy to round trip inefficiencies, this plus the construction costs add to the expense of implementing high levels of solar power.\n\n[[Concentrated solar power]] plants may use [[thermal energy storage|thermal storage]] to store solar energy, such as in high-temperature molten salts. These salts are an effective storage medium because they are low-cost, have a high specific heat capacity, and can deliver heat at temperatures compatible with conventional power systems.

The policies are implemented to promote national energy independence, high tech job creation and reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Three incentive mechanisms are often used in combination as investment subsidies: the authorities refund part of the cost of installation of the system, the electricity utility buys PV electricity from the producer under a multiyear contract at a guaranteed rate, and [[Solar Renewable Energy Certificates]] (SRECs)\n\n==== Rebates ====\n\nWith investment subsidies, the financial burden falls upon the taxpayer, while with feed-in tariffs the extra cost is distributed across the utilities' customer bases. While the investment subsidy may be simpler to administer, the main argument in favour of feed-in tariffs is the encouragement of quality. Investment subsidies are paid out as a function of the nameplate capacity of the installed system and are independent of its actual power yield over time, thus rewarding the overstatement of power and tolerating poor durability and maintenance. Some electric companies offer rebates to their customers, such as [[Austin Energy]] in [[Texas]], which offers $2.50/watt installed up to $15,000.<ref>[http://www.austinenergy.com/Energy%20Efficiency/Programs/Rebates/Solar%20Rebates/index.htm Solar Rebate Program] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725015516/http://www.austinenergy.com/Energy%20Efficiency/Programs/Rebates/Solar%20Rebates/index.htm |date=25 July 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==== Net metering ====\n[[File:Feed-in Tariff meter connections.png|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Net metering]], unlike a [[feed-in tariff]], requires only one meter, but it must be bi-directional.]]\n\nIn [[net metering]] the price of the electricity produced is the same as the price supplied to the consumer, and the consumer is billed on the difference between production and consumption. Net metering can usually be done with no changes to standard [[electricity meter]]s, which accurately measure power in both directions and automatically report the difference, and because it allows homeowners and businesses to generate electricity at a different time from consumption, effectively using the grid as a giant storage battery. With net metering, deficits are billed each month while surpluses are rolled over to the following month. Best practices call for perpetual roll over of kWh credits.<ref>[http://www.dsireusa.org/solar/solarpolicyguide/?id=17 Net Metering] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021172839/http://www.dsireusa.org/solar/solarpolicyguide/?id=17 |date=21 October 2012 }}</ref> Excess credits upon termination of service are either lost or paid for at a rate ranging from wholesale to retail rate or above, as can be excess annual credits.

They reward the number of kilowatt-hours produced over a long period of time, but because the rate is set by the authorities, it may result in perceived overpayment. The price paid per kilowatt-hour under a feed-in tariff exceeds the price of grid electricity. Net metering refers to the case where the price paid by the utility is the same as the price charged.\n\nThe complexity of approvals in California, Spain and Italy has prevented comparable growth to Germany even though the return on investment is better.{{citation needed|date = June 2015}} In some countries, additional incentives are offered for [[building-integrated photovoltaics]] (BIPV) compared to stand alone PV.\n* France + EUR 0.16 /kWh (compared to semi-integrated) or + EUR 0.27/kWh (compared to stand alone)\n* Italy + EUR 0.04\u20130.09 kWh\n* Germany + EUR 0.05/kWh (facades only)\n\n==== Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs) ====\n\nAlternatively, [[Solar Renewable Energy Certificate]]s (SRECs) allow for a market mechanism to set the price of the solar-generated electricity subsidy. In this mechanism, renewable energy production or consumption target is set, and the utility (more technically the Load Serving Entity) is obliged to purchase renewable energy or face a fine (Alternative Compliance Payment or ACP). The producer is credited for an SREC for every 1,000&nbsp;kWh of electricity produced. If the utility buys this SREC and retires it, they avoid paying the ACP. In principle, this system delivers the cheapest renewable energy since all solar facilities are eligible and can be installed in most economic locations. Uncertainties about the future value of SRECs have led to long-term SREC contract markets to give clarity to their prices and allow solar developers to pre-sell and hedge their credits.\n\nFinancial incentives for photovoltaics differ across countries, including [[Solar power in Australia|Australia]], [[Solar power in China|China]],<ref>[https://www.cnbc.com/id/32551044/site/14081545 China Racing Ahead of America in the Drive to Go Solar]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130706133417/http://www.cnbc.com/id/32551044/site/14081545 |date=6 July 2013 }}</ref> [[Solar power in Germany|Germany]],<ref name=\"German PV market\">{{cite web|url=http://www.solarbuzz.com/FastFactsGermany.htm|title=Power & Energy Technology - IHS Technology|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102171748/http://solarbuzz.com/FastFactsGermany.htm|archive-date=2 January 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Solar power in Israel|Israel]],<ref>[http://www.eng.shirasol.co.il/Approved-Feed-in-tariff-in-Israel.htm Approved \u2014 Feed-in tariff in Israel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603195611/http://eng.shirasol.co.il/Approved-Feed-in-tariff-in-Israel.htm |date=3 June 2009 }}.</ref> [[Solar power in Japan|Japan]], and the [[Solar power in the United States|United States]] and even across states within the US.\n\nThe Japanese government through its [[Ministry of International Trade and Industry]] ran a successful programme of subsidies from 1994 to 2003. By the end of 2004, Japan led the world in installed PV capacity with over 1.1&nbsp;[[Gigawatt|GW]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070208104905/http://www.oja-services.nl/iea-pvps/isr/22.htm]</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the German government introduced the first large-scale feed-in tariff system, under the [[German Renewable Energy Act]], which resulted in an explosive growth of PV installations in Germany. At the outset, the FIT was over 3x the retail price or 8x the industrial price. The principle behind the German system is a 20-year flat rate contract. The value of new contracts is programmed to decrease each year, in order to encourage the industry to pass on lower costs to the end-users. The programme has been more successful than expected with over 1GW installed in 2006, and political pressure is mounting to decrease the tariff to lessen the future burden on consumers.\n\nSubsequently, [[Solar power in Spain|Spain]], [[Solar power in Italy|Italy]], [[Solar power in Greece|Greece]]\u2014that enjoyed an early success with domestic solar-thermal installations for hot water needs\u2014and [[Solar power in France|France]] introduced feed-in tariffs. None have replicated the programmed decrease of FIT in new contracts though, making the German incentive relatively less and less attractive compared to other countries. The French and Greek FIT offer a high premium (EUR 0.55/kWh) for building integrated systems. California, Greece, France and Italy have 30\u201350% more insolation than Germany making them financially more attractive. The Greek domestic \"solar roof\" programme (adopted in June 2009 for installations up to 10&nbsp;kW) has internal rates of return of 10\u201315% at current commercial installation costs, which, furthermore, is tax-free.\n\nIn 2006 [[Solar power in California|California]] approved the '[[California Solar Initiative]]', offering a choice of investment subsidies or FIT for small and medium systems and a FIT for large systems. The small-system FIT of $0.39 per kWh (far less than EU countries) expires in just 5 years, and the alternate \"EPBB\" residential investment incentive is modest, averaging perhaps 20% of the cost. All California incentives are scheduled to decrease in the future depending as a function of the amount of PV capacity installed.\n\nAt the end of 2006, the Ontario Power Authority (OPA, Canada) began its Standard Offer Program, a precursor to the [[Green Energy Act 2009|Green Energy Act]], and the first in North America for distributed renewable projects of less than 10&nbsp; MW. The feed-in tariff guaranteed a fixed price of $0.42 CDN per kWh over a period of twenty years. Unlike net metering, all the electricity produced was sold to the OPA at the given rate.\n\n== Grid integration==\n{{main|Energy storage|Grid energy storage}}\n[[File:Abengoa Solar (7336087392).jpg|thumb| Construction of the Salt Tanks\nwhich provide efficient [[thermal energy storage]]<ref>Wright, matthew; Hearps, Patrick; et al.

This facility in [[Geesthacht]], Germany, also includes a solar array.\n}}\n\nThe overwhelming majority of electricity produced worldwide is used immediately since storage is usually more expensive and because traditional generators can adapt to demand. Both solar power and [[wind power]] are [[variable renewable energy]], meaning that all available output must be taken whenever it is available by moving through [[Electric power transmission|transmission]] lines to ''where it can be used now''. Since solar energy is not available at night, storing its energy is potentially an important issue particularly in off-grid and for future [[100% renewable energy]] scenarios to have continuous electricity availability.<ref>Carr (1976), p. 85</ref>\n\nSolar electricity is inherently variable and predictable by time of day, location, and seasons. In addition, solar is intermittent due to day/night cycles and unpredictable weather. How much of a special challenge solar power is in any given electric utility varies significantly. In a [[summer peak]] utility, solar is well matched to daytime cooling demands. In [[winter peak]] utilities, solar displaces other forms of generation, reducing their [[capacity factor]]s.\n\nIn an electricity system without [[grid energy storage]], generation from stored fuels (coal, biomass, natural gas, nuclear) must go up and down in reaction to the rise and fall of solar electricity (see [[load following power plant]]). While hydroelectric and natural gas plants can quickly respond to changes in load, coal, biomass and nuclear plants usually take considerable time to respond to load and can only be scheduled to follow the predictable variation. Depending on local circumstances, beyond about 20\u201340% of total generation, grid-connected [[intermittent energy source|intermittent source]]s like solar tend to require investment in some combination of [[Super grid|grid interconnections]], [[Grid energy storage|energy storage]] or [[Energy demand management|demand side management]]. Integrating large amounts of solar power with existing generation equipment has caused issues in some cases. For example, in Germany, California and Hawaii, electricity prices have been known to go negative when solar is generating a lot of power, displacing existing [[baseload]] generation contracts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/california-sun-solar-power-electricity-energy-prices-negative-renewables-green-climate-change-fossil-a7678086.html|title=California produced so much solar power, electricity prices just turned negative|author=|date=11 April 2017|website=independent.co.uk|access-date=30 April 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171211175722/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/california-sun-solar-power-electricity-energy-prices-negative-renewables-green-climate-change-fossil-a7678086.html|archive-date=11 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/plugged-in/3-reasons-hawaii-put-the-brakes-on-solar-and-why-the-same-won-t-happen-in-your-state/|title=3 Reasons Hawaii Put the Brakes on Solar--and Why the Same Won't Happen in Your State|first=Robert|last=Fares|date=|website=scientificamerican.com|access-date=30 April 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920121552/http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/plugged-in/3-reasons-hawaii-put-the-brakes-on-solar-and-why-the-same-won-t-happen-in-your-state/|archive-date=20 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nConventional hydroelectricity works very well in conjunction with solar power; water can be held back or released from a reservoir as required. Where a suitable river is not available, [[pumped-storage hydroelectricity]] uses solar power to pump water to a high reservoir on sunny days, then the energy is recovered at night and in bad weather by releasing water via a hydroelectric plant to a low reservoir where the cycle can begin again.<ref>{{cite web |title=Pumped Hydro Storage  |publisher=Electricity Storage Association  |url=http://www.electricitystorage.org/tech/technologies_technologies_pumpedhydro.htm  |access-date=31 July 2008  |url-status=dead  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621052054/http://www.electricitystorage.org/tech/technologies_technologies_pumpedhydro.htm  |archive-date=21 June 2008  |df=dmy }}</ref> \nThis cycle can lose 20% of the energy to round trip inefficiencies, this plus the construction costs add to the expense of implementing high levels of solar power.\n\n[[Concentrated solar power]] plants may use [[thermal energy storage|thermal storage]] to store solar energy, such as in high-temperature molten salts.

The study found that the land-use footprint, given in square meter-years per megawatt-hour (m<sup>2</sup>a/MWh), was lowest for wind, natural gas and rooftop PV, with 0.26, 0.49 and 0.59, respectively, and followed by utility-scale solar PV with 7.9. For CSP, the footprint was 9 and 14, using parabolic troughs and solar towers, respectively. The largest footprint had coal-fired power plants with 18&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>a/MWh.<ref>Hertwich and others, [http://www.pnas.org/content/112/20/6277.full.pdf \"Integrated life-cycle assessment of electricity-supply scenarios confirms global environmental benefit of low-carbon technologies\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123154831/http://www.pnas.org/content/112/20/6277.full.pdf |date=23 November 2015 }}, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 19 May 2015, v.112 n.20.</ref>\n\n== Emerging technologies ==\n\n=== Concentrator photovoltaics ===\n[[File:3 MW CPV project in Golmud, China.jpg|thumb|[[Concentrator photovoltaics|CPV modules]] on dual axis [[solar tracker]]s in Golmud, China]]\n\n[[Concentrator photovoltaics]] (CPV) systems employ sunlight concentrated onto photovoltaic surfaces for the purpose of [[electrical power production]].
