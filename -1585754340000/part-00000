Bell, president of sports betting information site Pregame.com, tracked every game Donaghy worked from 2003 to 2007.  He discovered that during the two seasons investigated by the NBA, the teams involved scored more points than expected by the Las Vegas sports books 57 percent of the time. In the previous two seasons, this only happened 44 percent of the time. According to Bell, the odds of such a discrepancy are 1 in 1,000, and there was \"a 99.9 percent chance that these results would not have happened without an outside factor.\"  He also found 10 straight games in 2007 in which Donaghy worked the game that the point spread moved 1.5 points or more before the tip&nbsp;\u2014 an indication that big money had been wagered on the game. The big money won every time&nbsp;\u2014another indication that \"something (was) going on.\"  However, Bell suggested that there was no way anyone who wasn't in on the fix could have known that something was amiss about Donaghy's actions during a game; he said it would have been another year at the earliest before anyone could have caught on.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?page=expertstatsdonaghy | title = Numbers indicate unlikely outcomes in games Donaghy officiated | publisher = ESPN.com | author = Wayne Drehs | date = July 24, 2007 | accessdate = July 25, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nHandicapper Brandon Lang told ESPN that it is fairly easy for a crooked sports official to fix a game, despite Stern's insistence that Donaghy was a \"rogue official\". According to Lang, an official can directly influence the outcome of a game 75 percent of the time if he has money on the game. For instance, Lang said that a crooked NBA referee can fix the total score by calling enough fouls to get both teams in the bonus. When a game is being fixed, Lang said, the officials should be the prime suspects because the players are making too much money to risk their future.

Bell, president of sports betting information site Pregame.com, tracked every game Donaghy worked from 2003 to 2007.  He discovered that during the two seasons investigated by the NBA, the teams involved scored more points than expected by the Las Vegas sports books 57 percent of the time. In the previous two seasons, this only happened 44 percent of the time. According to Bell, the odds of such a discrepancy are 1 in 1,000, and there was \"a 99.9 percent chance that these results would not have happened without an outside factor.\"  He also found 10 straight games in 2007 in which Donaghy worked the game that the point spread moved 1.5 points or more before the tip&nbsp;\u2014 an indication that big money had been wagered on the game.

This prompted [[Gibraltar Broadcasting Corporation|GBC]] in Gibraltar to end terrestrial retransmission of BBC Prime in 1999. Even after the BBC switched to broadcasting [[BBC#Unencrypted satellite transmissions|unencrypted]] on a [[Astra 2D|satellite with a much weaker signal]], many people in Spain and elsewhere could still receive these signals, particularly those who already had large satellite dishes.\n\n==Funding==\nUnlike the BBC's domestic channels, and some of their foreign channels paid for by the [[UK Foreign Office]], BBC Prime was funded by [[pay television|subscription]] available either as part of a satellite package or as a stand-alone channel. It was also funded by adverts placed on the channel in breaks, and because of this, it was not available in the UK. Much of BBC Prime's programming was available to watch through [[BBC One]], [[BBC Two|Two]] or the [[UKTV]] network, part owned by the BBC and showing archive programming.\n\n== Presentation ==\nWhen BBC Prime launched, its ident was consisted of 5 different diamonds shining, at first by each other, and then all of them, in a black background, with the BBC Prime logo placed in the bottom right corner. The logo at the time had the BBC logo, with \"Prime\" written in all capitals below in the Trajan Bold font. The ident had another version which had a quite jazz-styled music.\n\nOn 4 October 1997, the BBC went on a major rebrand, and BBC Prime was also affected by it. The logo now had the BBC blocks, with \"Prime\" in all capitals in the Gill Sans font next to it. The idents start with epileptic water scenes with full of colours, before settling on the main part of the ident, which features the water in a blue to orange gradient with ripples, and 2 marbles reflected and inverted by each other, with the logo being placed in the bottom.\n\nIn December 2000, BBC Prime rebranded again. The idents now featured cartoon draws of famous UK sights, like the Big Ben, the Tower Bridge or the Stonehenge, shooting fireworks, before the looped, 15-second long sequence with exploding firework animations came on. The idents had a xylophone-and-trumpet music, with firework sounds playing in the background.\n\nBBC Prime's final rebrand took place in August 2006, when BBC Learning was discontinued and the channel's gradual replacement started. The logo featured the 1997 logo being placed inside a turquoise circle. The idents consisted of differently coloured circles as people who do different situations, like going on a rollercoaster, jumping and swimming in the pool, or the grass being clipped with a lawnrower. These idents were used until BBC Prime was completely replaced by BBC Entertainment on 11 November 2009.\n\n==Availability==\nThe channel was available in many areas through [[satellite television|satellite]] and [[cable television]]\n*In the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]], the channel was available on cable, alongside [[BBC One]], [[BBC Two]] and [[BBC World News]].\n*It was available on [[digital terrestrial television]] (DTT) in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Malta]].\n*In [[Gibraltar]], [[Gibraltar Broadcasting Corporation|GBC]] relayed BBC Prime  on its VHF and UHF channels with opt-outs.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?redir_esc=y&id=TTe4AAAAIAAJ&dq=%22bbc+prime%22+gibraltar&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=%22bbc+prime%22+ ''Handbook \u2013 Commonwealth Broadcasting Association''], Secretariat, Commonwealth Broadcasting Association, 1997, page 59</ref>\n*In [[Turkey]], it was available on [[Turksat (company)|T\u00fcrksat]] Cable TV and [[Digiturk]].\n*In [[Italy]], it was available on [[SKY Italia]].\n*In [[MENA]], it was available on the [[Orbit Communications Company|Orbit Network]].\n*The [[South Africa]] service was launched in 1999 and contained some different programmes to that broadcast in Europe, due to some programmes already being licensed to other channels.\n*The [[Asia]] service was launched on 1 December 2004 and had a different schedule to that of the Europe service to reflect the different time zones, and cultural practices.
