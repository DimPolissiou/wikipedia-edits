It serves 26 stations between [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]] and Portland, running predominantly east\u2013west. An [[airport rail link]], the line connects central Beaverton, [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|Portland City Center]], and [[Neighborhoods of Portland, Oregon#Northeast|Northeast Portland]] to [[Portland International Airport]]. From [[Beaverton Transit Center]] to [[Gateway/Northeast 99th Avenue Transit Center]], the Red Line shares its route with the [[MAX Blue Line|Blue Line]] and the [[MAX Green Line|Green Line]]; it then splits to a {{convert|5.5|mi|km|1|adj=on}} segment, referred to as the '''Airport MAX''' extension, to [[Portland International Airport station]]. Service runs for 22 hours per day on a [[headway]] of at least 15 minutes daily. It is the second-busiest service in the MAX system, carrying an average of 22,530 passengers per weekday in September 2019.\n\nProposals for an airport light rail service surfaced in the mid-1980s and efforts were accelerated following Portland International Airport's rapid expansion in the 1990s. Conceived from an [[Proposal (business)|unsolicited proposal]] from engineering company [[Bechtel]] in 1997, the Airport MAX project was [[design\u2013build|designed and built]] under a [[public\u2013private partnership]] between a [[consortium]] of Bechtel and [[Trammell Crow Company|Trammell Crow]], the [[Port of Portland (Oregon)|Port of Portland]], and local governments. The extension began construction in 1999 and was completed in just under two years due to local and private financing and the utilization of existing public [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]]. The Red Line commenced service between downtown Portland and the airport on September&nbsp;10, 2001. Amid strong westside ridership on the Blue Line, Red Line service was extended west along existing tracks to Beaverton Transit Center in 2003. TriMet is planning several improvements for the line, including a further extension west to [[Fair Complex/Hillsboro Airport station]] in [[Hillsboro, Oregon|Hillsboro]] by 2024.\n\n==History==\n===Background and partnership agreement===\n[[File:Cascade Station shopping center entrance - Portland, Oregon.JPG|thumb|left|alt=a road entrance to Cascade Station facing Sports Authority|Cascade Station shopping center, which was developed by Bechtel in exchange for building the Airport MAX]]\n\nIn 1975, during the preliminary design phase of [[Interstate 205 (Oregon\u2013Washington)|Interstate 205]] (I-205), Portland transportation planners recommended downsizing the freeway and including right-of-way reserved for future transit; this was later realized as the [[I-205 Transitway]].<ref name=\"Selinger 82\">{{cite web |title=Making History: 45 Years of Transit in the Portland Region |last=Selinger |first=Philip |date=2015 |publisher=TriMet |url=https://trimet.org/pdfs/history/making-history.pdf |access-date=July 26, 2018 |page=82\u201383 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509021212/https://trimet.org/pdfs/history/making-history.pdf |archive-date=May 9, 2018 |url-status=unfit}}</ref> In 1986,<ref>{{cite news |last=Kohler |first=Vince |title=Metro study group finds interest in light-rail line along I-205 |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=March 27, 1986 |page=1}}</ref> transit plans by [[Metro (Oregon regional government)|Metro]] regional government began calling for a light rail extension to [[Portland International Airport]],<ref>{{cite news |last=Bodine |first=Harry |title=Light rail expansion backed by officials |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=September 30, 1987 |page=B12}}</ref> which was then being served by TriMet buses operating from [[Sandy Boulevard]],<ref name=\"Route switches\">{{cite news |last=Stewart |first=Bill |title=Most Tri-Met fares rise Saturday, while route switches start Sept. 9 |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=August 31, 2001 |page=B1}}</ref> with construction projected to begin around 2010.<ref name=\"max-red-line-factsheet-2016\"/> Early proposals envisioned a line running from [[Clackamas County, Oregon|Clackamas County]] to the airport along the I-205 Transitway and connecting with MAX at [[Gateway/Northeast 99th Avenue Transit Center]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Mayer |first=James |title=Tri-Met looks to the future: The success of MAX sparks dreams of expanding |date=April 9, 1989 |newspaper=The Oregonian |page=A1}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Federman |first=Stan |title=Light rail completes two years of success |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=September 9, 1988 |page=A16}}</ref>\n\nThe airport expanded rapidly in the following decade as traffic increased from 6&nbsp;million to 14&nbsp;million passengers between 1990 and 2000.<ref name=\"max-red-line-factsheet-2016\"/><ref name=\"Gosling\">{{cite report |last=Gosling |first=Geoffrey D. |title=Case Study Report: Portland MAX Airport Extension |publisher=Mineta Transportation Institute |page=1 |date=May 2012 |url=https://transweb.sjsu.edu/sites/default/files/pdfs/research/2503-cs6-Portland-MAX-Airport-Extension.pdf |access-date=August 24, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180828035535/https://transweb.sjsu.edu/sites/default/files/pdfs/research/2503-cs6-Portland-MAX-Airport-Extension.pdf |archive-date=August 28, 2018}}</ref> Anticipating this growth, the [[Port of Portland (Oregon)|Port of Portland]] embarked on a 20-year, $300 million phased expansion of the airport in November 1991, which expanded the main passenger terminal, rebuilt an existing concourse, and added a fifth concourse.<ref>{{cite news |last=Sturtz |first=Paul |date=June 3, 1991 |title=Airport ready to take off on $300 million expansion |newspaper=[[Portland Business Journal]] |page=1A}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Hamburg |first=Ken |title=Port of Portland speeds pace of airport terminal expansion |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=December 10, 1992 |page=E10}}</ref> This project also reserved space for a future light rail station near the southern end of the arrivals hall and baggage claim area.<ref>{{cite news |last=Mayes |first=Steve |title=Portland's airport for the future only needs a $300 million ticket |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=April 11, 1991 |page=A1}}</ref><ref>{{cite report |title=Airport Max: A Case Study |url=http://www.transportation-finance.org/pdf/funding_financing/funding/local_funding/Airport_Max_Case_Study.pdf |publisher=BATIC Institute |access-date=August 26, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180828035552/http://www.transportation-finance.org/pdf/funding_financing/funding/local_funding/Airport_Max_Case_Study.pdf |archive-date=August 28, 2018}}</ref> In 1994, parking lots operating at 90&nbsp;percent capacity revealed that the Port's growth projections had failed to meet the high demand.

It serves 26 stations between [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]] and Portland, running predominantly east\u2013west. An [[airport rail link]], the line connects central Beaverton, [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|Portland City Center]], and [[Neighborhoods of Portland, Oregon#Northeast|Northeast Portland]] to [[Portland International Airport]]. From [[Beaverton Transit Center]] to [[Gateway/Northeast 99th Avenue Transit Center]], the Red Line shares its route with the [[MAX Blue Line|Blue Line]] and the [[MAX Green Line|Green Line]]; it then splits to a {{convert|5.5|mi|km|1|adj=on}} segment, referred to as the '''Airport MAX''' extension, to [[Portland International Airport station]]. Service runs for 22 hours per day on a [[headway]] of at least 15 minutes daily. It is the second-busiest service in the MAX system, carrying an average of 22,530 passengers per weekday in September 2019.\n\nProposals for an airport light rail service surfaced in the mid-1980s and efforts were accelerated following Portland International Airport's rapid expansion in the 1990s. Conceived from an [[Proposal (business)|unsolicited proposal]] from engineering company [[Bechtel]] in 1997, the Airport MAX project was [[design\u2013build|designed and built]] under a [[public\u2013private partnership]] between a [[consortium]] of Bechtel and [[Trammell Crow Company|Trammell Crow]], the [[Port of Portland (Oregon)|Port of Portland]], and local governments. The extension began construction in 1999 and was completed in just under two years due to local and private financing and the utilization of existing public [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]]. The Red Line commenced service between downtown Portland and the airport on September&nbsp;10, 2001. Amid strong westside ridership on the Blue Line, Red Line service was extended west along existing tracks to Beaverton Transit Center in 2003.

Authoritative parents rely on positive reinforcement and infrequent use of punishment. Parents are more aware of a child's feelings and capabilities and support the development of a child's autonomy within reasonable limits. There is a give-and-take atmosphere involved in parent-child communication and both control and support are balanced. Research{{vague|date=March 2017}} shows that this style is more beneficial than the too-hard authoritarian style or the too-soft permissive style.\n\n;Authoritarian parenting styles\n:Authoritarian parents are very rigid and strict. High demands are placed on the child, but there is little responsiveness to them. Parents who practice authoritarian-style parenting have a non-negotiable set of rules and expectations that are strictly enforced and require rigid obedience. When the rules are not followed, punishment is often used to promote and insure future obedience.<ref name=\"DOI_10.1177/0192513X08322933\" /> There is usually no explanation of punishment except that the child is in trouble for breaking a rule.<ref name=\"DOI_10.1177/0192513X08322933\" /> This parenting style is strongly associated with [[corporal punishment]], such as [[spanking]] and \"Because I said so\" is a typical response to a child's question of authority. This type of parenting is seen more often in working-class families than in the middle class{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}. In 1983 Diana Baumrind found that children raised in an authoritarian-style home were less cheerful, more moody and more vulnerable to stress. In many cases these children also demonstrated passive hostility.\n\n;Permissive parenting\n:Permissive, or indulgent, parenting is more popular in middle-class than in working-class families{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}. In these settings, a child's freedom and autonomy are highly valued, and parents tend to rely mostly on reasoning and explanation. Parents are undemanding, so there tends to be little if any punishment or explicit rules in this style of parenting. These parents say that their children are free from external constraints and tend to be highly responsive to whatever the child wants at the time. Children of permissive parents are generally happy but sometimes show low levels of self-control and self-reliance because they lack structure at home.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/permissive_parenting_style|title=permissive parenting|last=|first=|date=|website=MSU.EDU|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n;Uninvolved parenting\n:An uninvolved or neglectful parenting style is when parents are often emotionally or physically absent.<ref name=\"DOI:10.1080/01494920802010140\" /> They have little to no expectation of the child and regularly have no communication. They are not responsive to a child's needs and have little to no behavioral expectations. If present, they may provide what the child needs for survival with little to no engagement.<ref name=\"DOI:10.1080/01494920802010140\" /> There is often a large gap between parents and children with this parenting style.{{vague|date=July 2018}} Children with little or no communication with their own parents tended to be victimized by other children and may themselves exhibit deviant behavior.<ref name=\"doi_10.1177/1077559509347012\" /> Children of uninvolved parents suffer in [[social competence]], [[academic performance]], [[psychosocial development]] and problem behavior.\n\nThere is no single definitive model of parenting. With authoritarian and permissive parenting on opposite sides of the spectrum, most conventional and modern models of parenting fall somewhere in between. Parenting strategies, as well as behaviors and ideals of what parents expect, (whether communicated verbally and/or non-verbally) can also play a significant role in a child's development.\n\n==Practices==\n[[File:Father and child.jpg|thumb|A father and son]]\nA parenting practice is a specific behavior that a parent uses in raising a child.<ref name=Spera/> For example, a common parent practice intended to promote academic success is reading books to the child.

This will create a realistic aptitude within children's growing psyche;\n# Stay consistent, as children need structure: parents that institute regular routines see benefits in their children's behavioral pattern;\n# Utilize resources available to them, reaching out into the community and building a [[It takes a village|supportive social network]];\n# Take more interest in their child's educational and early development needs (e.g. [[Play (activity)|Play]] that enhances socialization, autonomy, cohesion, calmness and trust.); and\n# Keep an open communication and stay aware of, and updated on, what their child is seeing, learning and doing and how it is affecting them.\n\nParenting skills are often assumed to be self-evident or naturally present in parents. But those who come from a negative/vulnerable environment might tend to pass on what they suffered onto their families oppressed by their own experiences, those who have inaccurate beliefs or poorer understanding of developmental milestones only engage in the way they know which may result in problematic parenting.

Indigenous myths and folklore often personify animals and objects, reaffirming the belief that everything possess a soul and must be respected. These stories help preserve language and are used to reflect certain values or cultural histories.<ref>Archibald, Jo-Ann, (2008). Indigenous Storywork: Educating The Heart, Mind, Body and Spirit.

Rather than directly informing the child what they should do, the parent instead might tell a story of a similar situation or scenario. The character in the story is used to help the child see what the implications of their decision may be, without directly making the decision for them. This teaches the child to be decisive and independent, while still providing some guidance.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Delgado-Gaitan |first1=Concha |title=Consejos: The Power of Cultural Narratives |journal=Anthropology & Education Quarterly |volume=25 |issue=3 |year=1994 |pages=298\u2013316 |jstor=3195848 |doi=10.1525/aeq.1994.25.3.04x0146p}}</ref>\n\nThe playful form of [[Teasing#Teasing in Indigenous American Communities|teasing]] is a parenting method used in some Indigenous American communities to keep children out of danger and guide their behavior. This form of teasing utilizes stories, fabrications, or empty threats to guide children in making safe, intelligent decisions. It can teach children values by establishing expectations and encouraging the child to meet them via playful jokes and/or idle threats. For example, a parent may tell a child that there is a monster that jumps on children's backs if they walk alone at night. This explanation can help keep the child safe because instilling that alarm creates greater awareness and lessens the likelihood that they will wander alone into trouble.<ref>Brown, P. (2002).

[[Nonverbal communication#Children's Learning in Indigenous American Communities|Nonverbal communication]] is much of the way that children learn about such \"respect\" from parents and other family members.<ref name=\"Source 1996\">Source: Chisholm, J.S.

This form of guidance fosters \u201crespect\u201d not only for the child's family members but also to the community as a whole. On this run, the community uses humor and laughter with each other, without directly including the child\u2014who may not wish to get up early and run\u2014to promote the child's motivation to participate and become an active member of the community.<ref name=\"Source 1996\" /> To modify children's behavior in a nonverbal manner, parents also promote inclusion in the morning runs by placing their child in the snow and having them stay longer if they protest; this is done within a context of warmth, laughter, and community, to help incorporate the child into the practice.<ref name=\"Source 1996\" />\n\nA tool parents use in Indigenous American cultures is to [[Child integration|incorporate children]] into everyday life, including adult activities, to pass on the parents\u2019 knowledge by allowing the child to [[Observational learning#Indigenous communities of the Americas|learn through observation]].

At this stage, parents are heavily involved in showing the small child how to do things rather than just doing things for them; it is usual for the [[toddler]] to mimic the parents.

It is also normal for toddlers to be frequently frustrated. It is an essential step to their development. They will learn through experience; trial and error. This means that they need to experience being frustrated when something does not work for them, in order to move on to the next stage.

Parents may assist their child by encouraging social interactions and modelling proper social behaviors. A large part of learning in the early years comes from being involved in activities and household duties.

Parenting styles in this area diverge greatly at this stage with some parents becoming heavily involved in arranging organized activities and early learning programs. Other parents choose to let the child develop with few organized activities.\n\nChildren begin to learn responsibility, and consequences of their actions, with parental assistance. Some parents provide a small allowance that increases with age to help teach children the value of money and how to be responsible with it.\n\nParents who are consistent and fair with their [[child discipline|discipline]], who openly communicate and offer explanations to their children, and who do not neglect the needs of their children in some way often find they have fewer problems with their children as they mature.\n\n===Adolescents===\n\n{{More citations needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n{{Main|Adolescence}}\nParents often feel isolated and alone in parenting [[Adolescence|adolescents]].<ref>[https://www.techspurs.com/sharenting/ Sharenting & Oversharenting] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816042806/https://www.techspurs.com/sharenting/ |date=16 August 2016 }}</ref> Adolescence can be a time of high [[risk]] for children, where new-found freedoms can result in decisions that drastically open up or close off life opportunities.

Therefore, it is important that parents treat them as young adults. Parental issues at this stage of parenting include dealing with \"[[rebellious]]\" [[teenager]]s who consistently push the limits. In order to prevent these issues, it is important for the parents to build a trusting relationship with their children. This can be achieved by planning and taking part in fun activities together, keeping promises made to the children, spending time with them, not reminding kids about their past mistakes and listening to and talking to them.\n\nWhen a trusting relationship is built up, adolescents are more likely to approach their parents for help when faced with negative peer pressure. Helping the children build a strong foundation will help them resist negative peer pressure.\n\n===Adults===\nParenting does not usually end when a child turns 18. Support may be needed in a child's life well beyond the adolescent years and continues into middle and later adulthood.

The life perspective and wisdom given by a parent can benefit their adult children in their own lives.

Authoritative parents rely on positive reinforcement and infrequent use of punishment. Parents are more aware of a child's feelings and capabilities and support the development of a child's autonomy within reasonable limits. There is a give-and-take atmosphere involved in parent-child communication and both control and support are balanced. Research{{vague|date=March 2017}} shows that this style is more beneficial than the too-hard authoritarian style or the too-soft permissive style.\n\n;Authoritarian parenting styles\n:Authoritarian parents are very rigid and strict. High demands are placed on the child, but there is little responsiveness to them. Parents who practice authoritarian-style parenting have a non-negotiable set of rules and expectations that are strictly enforced and require rigid obedience. When the rules are not followed, punishment is often used to promote and insure future obedience.<ref name=\"DOI_10.1177/0192513X08322933\" /> There is usually no explanation of punishment except that the child is in trouble for breaking a rule.<ref name=\"DOI_10.1177/0192513X08322933\" /> This parenting style is strongly associated with [[corporal punishment]], such as [[spanking]] and \"Because I said so\" is a typical response to a child's question of authority. This type of parenting is seen more often in working-class families than in the middle class{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}. In 1983 Diana Baumrind found that children raised in an authoritarian-style home were less cheerful, more moody and more vulnerable to stress. In many cases these children also demonstrated passive hostility.\n\n;Permissive parenting\n:Permissive, or indulgent, parenting is more popular in middle-class than in working-class families{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}. In these settings, a child's freedom and autonomy are highly valued, and parents tend to rely mostly on reasoning and explanation. Parents are undemanding, so there tends to be little if any punishment or explicit rules in this style of parenting. These parents say that their children are free from external constraints and tend to be highly responsive to whatever the child wants at the time. Children of permissive parents are generally happy but sometimes show low levels of self-control and self-reliance because they lack structure at home.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/permissive_parenting_style|title=permissive parenting|last=|first=|date=|website=MSU.EDU|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n;Uninvolved parenting\n:An uninvolved or neglectful parenting style is when parents are often emotionally or physically absent.<ref name=\"DOI:10.1080/01494920802010140\" /> They have little to no expectation of the child and regularly have no communication.

With authoritarian and permissive parenting on opposite sides of the spectrum, most conventional and modern models of parenting fall somewhere in between. Parenting strategies, as well as behaviors and ideals of what parents expect, (whether communicated verbally and/or non-verbally) can also play a significant role in a child's development.\n\n==Practices==\n[[File:Father and child.jpg|thumb|A father and son]]\nA parenting practice is a specific behavior that a parent uses in raising a child.<ref name=Spera/> For example, a common parent practice intended to promote academic success is reading books to the child.

Parenting takes a lot of skill and patience and is a constant work on growth. The cognitive potential, social skills, and behavioral functioning a child acquires during the early years are fundamentally dependent on the quality of their interactions with their parents.\n\nCanadian Council on Learning says that children benefit most (avoids poor developmental outcomes) when their parents:<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20120914112822/http://www.ccl-cca.ca/pdfs/LessonsInLearning/Dec-13-07-Parenting-styles.pdf{{full citation needed|date=June 2016}}</ref>\n\n# Communicate truthfully about events or discussions that have happened, because authenticity from parents who explain and help their children understand what happens and how they are involved if they are without giving defining rules. This will create a realistic aptitude within children's growing psyche;\n# Stay consistent, as children need structure: parents that institute regular routines see benefits in their children's behavioral pattern;\n# Utilize resources available to them, reaching out into the community and building a [[It takes a village|supportive social network]];\n# Take more interest in their child's educational and early development needs (e.g. [[Play (activity)|Play]] that enhances socialization, autonomy, cohesion, calmness and trust.); and\n# Keep an open communication and stay aware of, and updated on, what their child is seeing, learning and doing and how it is affecting them.\n\nParenting skills are often assumed to be self-evident or naturally present in parents. But those who come from a negative/vulnerable environment might tend to pass on what they suffered onto their families oppressed by their own experiences, those who have inaccurate beliefs or poorer understanding of developmental milestones only engage in the way they know which may result in problematic parenting.

Indigenous myths and folklore often personify animals and objects, reaffirming the belief that everything possess a soul and must be respected. These stories help preserve language and are used to reflect certain values or cultural histories.<ref>Archibald, Jo-Ann, (2008). Indigenous Storywork: Educating The Heart, Mind, Body and Spirit. Vancouver, British Columbia: The University of British Columbia Press.{{page needed|date=June 2016}}</ref>\n\n''Consejos'' are a [[Narrative#In cultural storytelling|narrative]] form of advice giving that provides the recipient with maximum autonomy in the situation as a result of their indirect teaching style. Rather than directly informing the child what they should do, the parent instead might tell a story of a similar situation or scenario. The character in the story is used to help the child see what the implications of their decision may be, without directly making the decision for them. This teaches the child to be decisive and independent, while still providing some guidance.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Delgado-Gaitan |first1=Concha |title=Consejos: The Power of Cultural Narratives |journal=Anthropology & Education Quarterly |volume=25 |issue=3 |year=1994 |pages=298\u2013316 |jstor=3195848 |doi=10.1525/aeq.1994.25.3.04x0146p}}</ref>\n\nThe playful form of [[Teasing#Teasing in Indigenous American Communities|teasing]] is a parenting method used in some Indigenous American communities to keep children out of danger and guide their behavior. This form of teasing utilizes stories, fabrications, or empty threats to guide children in making safe, intelligent decisions. It can teach children values by establishing expectations and encouraging the child to meet them via playful jokes and/or idle threats. For example, a parent may tell a child that there is a monster that jumps on children's backs if they walk alone at night. This explanation can help keep the child safe because instilling that alarm creates greater awareness and lessens the likelihood that they will wander alone into trouble.<ref>Brown, P. (2002).

[[Nonverbal communication#Children's Learning in Indigenous American Communities|Nonverbal communication]] is much of the way that children learn about such \"respect\" from parents and other family members.<ref name=\"Source 1996\">Source: Chisholm, J.S.

This form of guidance fosters \u201crespect\u201d not only for the child's family members but also to the community as a whole. On this run, the community uses humor and laughter with each other, without directly including the child\u2014who may not wish to get up early and run\u2014to promote the child's motivation to participate and become an active member of the community.<ref name=\"Source 1996\" /> To modify children's behavior in a nonverbal manner, parents also promote inclusion in the morning runs by placing their child in the snow and having them stay longer if they protest; this is done within a context of warmth, laughter, and community, to help incorporate the child into the practice.<ref name=\"Source 1996\" />\n\nA tool parents use in Indigenous American cultures is to [[Child integration|incorporate children]] into everyday life, including adult activities, to pass on the parents\u2019 knowledge by allowing the child to [[Observational learning#Indigenous communities of the Americas|learn through observation]].

At this stage, parents are heavily involved in showing the small child how to do things rather than just doing things for them; it is usual for the [[toddler]] to mimic the parents. Toddlers need help to build their vocabulary, increase their communication skills, and manage their emotions. Toddlers will also begin to understand social etiquette such as being polite and taking turns.<ref>https://www.parents.com/toddlers-preschoolers/development/manners/teaching-kids-to-mind-their-manners/</ref>[[File:Parenting.JPG|thumb|A father and daughter in [[Trivandrum]], [[India]]|left]]Toddlers are very curious about the world around them and eager to explore it. They seek greater independence and responsibility and may become frustrated when things do not go the way they want or expect. [[Tantrum]]s begin at this stage, which is sometimes referred to as the 'Terrible Twos'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.safekids.co.uk/terrible-twos-explained.html |title=The Terrible Twos Explained - Safe Kids (UK) |publisher=Safe Kids |date=10 May 2011 |accessdate=2 May 2012}}</ref> Tantrums are often caused by the child's frustration over the particular situation, sometimes simply not being able to communicate properly. Parents of toddlers are expected to help guide and teach the child, establish basic routines (such as washing hands before meals or brushing teeth before bed), and increase the child's responsibilities. It is also normal for toddlers to be frequently frustrated. It is an essential step to their development. They will learn through experience; trial and error. This means that they need to experience being frustrated when something does not work for them, in order to move on to the next stage. When the toddler is frustrated, they will often behave badly with actions like screaming, hitting or biting. Parents need to be careful when reacting to such behaviors, giving threats or punishments is not helpful and will only make the situation worse.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pitman|first=Teresa|title=Toddler Frustration|url=http://www.todaysparent.com/toddler/toddler-behaviour/toddler-frustration|publisher=Todaysparent|accessdate=3 December 2011}}</ref>  Research groups led by [[Daniel Schechter]], Alytia Levendosky, and others have shown that parents with histories of maltreatment and violence exposure often have difficulty helping their toddlers and preschool-age children with these very same emotionally dysregulated behaviors, which can remind traumatized parents of their adverse experiences and associated mental states.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schechter |first1=Daniel S. |last2=Willheim |first2=Erica |last3=Hinojosa |first3=Claudia |last4=Scholfield-Kleinman |first4=Kimberly |last5=Turner |first5=J.

They are able to reason and can make their own decisions given hypothetical situations. Young children demand constant attention, but will learn how to deal with boredom and be able to play independently. They also enjoy helping and feeling useful and able. Parents may assist their child by encouraging social interactions and modelling proper social behaviors. A large part of learning in the early years comes from being involved in activities and household duties. Parents who observe their children in play or join with them in child-driven play have the opportunity to glimpse into their children's world, learn to communicate more effectively with their children and are given another setting to offer gentle, nurturing guidance.<ref name=AAP>{{cite web|title=The Importance of Play in Promoting Healthy Child Development and Maintaining Strong Parent-Child Bonds |url=http://www.wcss.wa.edu.au/pdf/importanceoftheplay_AAP.pdf |author=Kenneth R.

Parenting styles in this area diverge greatly at this stage with some parents becoming heavily involved in arranging organized activities and early learning programs. Other parents choose to let the child develop with few organized activities.\n\nChildren begin to learn responsibility, and consequences of their actions, with parental assistance. Some parents provide a small allowance that increases with age to help teach children the value of money and how to be responsible with it.\n\nParents who are consistent and fair with their [[child discipline|discipline]], who openly communicate and offer explanations to their children, and who do not neglect the needs of their children in some way often find they have fewer problems with their children as they mature.\n\n===Adolescents===\n\n{{More citations needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n{{Main|Adolescence}}\nParents often feel isolated and alone in parenting [[Adolescence|adolescents]].<ref>[https://www.techspurs.com/sharenting/ Sharenting & Oversharenting] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816042806/https://www.techspurs.com/sharenting/ |date=16 August 2016 }}</ref> Adolescence can be a time of high [[risk]] for children, where new-found freedoms can result in decisions that drastically open up or close off life opportunities. There are also large changes occurring in the [https://www.talkingtoteens.com/about-your-teenager/ brain during adolescence]; the emotional center of the brain is now fully developed but the rational frontal cortex hasn't matured yet to keep all of those emotions in check.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.talkingtoteens.com/about-your-teenager/|title=WHAT WAS MY TEENAGER THINKING?|date=2017-09-26|work=Talking to Teens|access-date=2018-02-12|language=en-US}}</ref> Adolescents tend to increase the amount of time they spend with peers of the opposite gender; however, they still maintain the amount of time they spend with those of the same gender\u2014and they do this by decreasing the amount of time they spend with their parents.\n\nAlthough adolescents look to [[peer group|peers]] and adults outside the family for guidance and models for how to behave, parents remain influential in their development. Studies show that parents have a significant impact, for instance, on how much teens drink.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.talkingtoteens.com/underage-drinking/|title=7 Things Most Parents Get Wrong About Teen Drinking|date=2017-07-07|work=Talking to Teens|access-date=2018-02-12|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nDuring adolescence children are beginning to form their [[identity (social science)|identity]] and are testing and developing the interpersonal and occupational roles that they will assume as adults. Therefore, it is important that parents treat them as young adults. Parental issues at this stage of parenting include dealing with \"[[rebellious]]\" [[teenager]]s who consistently push the limits. In order to prevent these issues, it is important for the parents to build a trusting relationship with their children. This can be achieved by planning and taking part in fun activities together, keeping promises made to the children, spending time with them, not reminding kids about their past mistakes and listening to and talking to them.\n\nWhen a trusting relationship is built up, adolescents are more likely to approach their parents for help when faced with negative peer pressure. Helping the children build a strong foundation will help them resist negative peer pressure.\n\n===Adults===\nParenting does not usually end when a child turns 18. Support may be needed in a child's life well beyond the adolescent years and continues into middle and later adulthood. Parenting can be a lifelong process.\n\nParents may provide financial support to their adult children, which can also include providing an inheritance after death. The life perspective and wisdom given by a parent can benefit their adult children in their own lives. Becoming a [[grandparent]] is another milestone and has many similarities with parenting.\n\nRoles can be reversed in some ways when adult children become [[caregivers]] to their elderly parents.\n\n==Assistance==\n{{Main|Child care}}\nParents may receive assistance with caring for their children through child care programs.\n\n==Childbearing and happiness==\nData from the [[British Household Panel Survey]] and the German [[Socio-Economic Panel]] suggests that having up to two children increases happiness in the years around the birth, and mostly so for those who have postponed childbearing.

Its capital and largest city is [[Hangzhou]]. Zhejiang is bordered by [[Jiangsu]] and [[Shanghai]] to the north, [[Anhui]] to the northwest, [[Jiangxi]] to the west, and [[Fujian]] to the south. To the east is the [[East China Sea]], beyond which lie the [[Ryukyu Islands]] of [[Japan]]. The population of Zhejiang stands at 57 million, the 10th highest among China. Other notable cities include [[Ningbo]] and [[Wenzhou]]. It has been called 'the backbone of China' due to being a major driving force in the Chinese economy and being the birthplace of several notable persons, including the [[Kuomintang|Chinese Nationalist]] leader [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and entrepreneur [[Jack Ma]].\n\nThe area of Zhejiang was controlled by the [[Yue (state)|Kingdom of Yue]] during the [[Spring and Autumn period]]. The [[Qin Empire]] later annexed it in 222 BC. Under the late [[Ming dynasty]] and the [[Qing dynasty]] that followed it, Zhejiang's ports became important centers of international trade. It was occupied by the [[Empire of Japan]] during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Second Sino-Japanese war]] and placed under the control of the Japanese puppet state known as the [[Reorganized National Government of China]]. After Japan's defeat, Zhejiang's economy became stagnant under [[Mao Zedong]]'s policies.<ref name=\"wiley\" />\n\nNevertheless, after [[Chinese economic reform|China's economic reform]], Zhejiang has grown to be considered one of China's wealthiest provinces, ranking [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP|fourth in GDP]] nationally and [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP per capita|fifth by GDP per capita]], with a nominal GDP of [[Renminbi|CN\uffe5]]5.62 trilion ([[United States dollar|US$]]849 billion) as of 2018. Zhejiang's economy is based on electromechanical industries, [[textiles]], chemical industries, food, and construction materials.\n\nZhejiang consists mostly of hills, which account for about 70% of its total area, with higher altitudes towards the south and the west. Zhejiang has China's longest [[coast]]line. The [[Qiantang River]] runs through the province, from which it derives its name. Included in the province are three thousand islands, the most in China. The capital [[Hangzhou]] marks the end of the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]], and lies on [[Hangzhou Bay]] on the north of Zhejiang, which separates [[Shanghai]] and [[Ningbo]]. The bay contains many small islands collectively called the [[Zhoushan Islands]].\n\n[[Hangzhou]] is a historically important city of China, and is considered a [[Global city|World City]] with a \"Beta+\" classification according to [[Globalization and World Cities Research Network|GaWC]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2018t.html|title=GaWC - The World According to GaWC 2018|website=www.lboro.ac.uk|access-date=2019-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170503165246/http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2016t.html|archive-date=3 May 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> It includes the notable [[West Lake]].

Instead, this area was populated by peoples collectively known as Dongyue and the [[Ouyue]].\n\nThe [[kingdom of Yue]] began to appear in the chronicles and records written during the [[Spring and Autumn period]]. According to the chronicles, the kingdom of Yue was in northern Zhejiang. [[Shiji]] claims that its leaders were descended from the [[Xia dynasty|Xia]] founder [[Yu the Great]]. The \"[[Song of the Yue Boatman]]\" ({{zh|c=\u8d8a\u4eba\u6b4c |p=Yu\u00e8r\u00e9n G\u0113 |l=Song of the man of Yue}}) was transliterated into Chinese and recorded by authors in north China or inland China of Hebei and Henan around 528 BC. The song shows that the Yue people spoke a language that was mutually unintelligible with the dialects spoken in north and inland China. The [[Sword of Goujian]] bears [[bird-worm seal script]]. [[Yuen\u00fc]] ({{zh|c=\u8d8a\u5973 |p=Yu\u00e8n\u01da |w=Y\u00fceh-n\u00fc |l=the Lady of Yue |links=no}}) was a swordswoman from the state of Yue. To check the growth of the [[Wu (state)|kingdom of Wu]], [[state of Chu|Chu]] pursued a policy of strengthening Yue.\n\nUnder [[Goujian|King Goujian]], Yue recovered from its early reverses and fully annexed the lands of its rival in {{nowrap|473 BC}}. The Yue kings then moved their capital center from their original home around [[Mount Kuaiji]] in present-day [[Shaoxing]] to the former Wu capital at present-day [[Suzhou]]. With no southern power to turn against Yue, Chu opposed it directly and, in 333&nbsp;BC, succeeded in destroying it. Yue's former lands were annexed by the [[Qin Empire]] in 222&nbsp;BC and organized into a [[commandery (China)|commandery]] named for Kuaiji in Zhejiang but initially headquartered in [[Wu County|Wu]] in [[Jiangsu]].\n\n===Han and the Three Kingdoms===\n[[Kuaiji Commandery]] was the initial power base for [[Xiang Liang]] and [[Xiang Yu]]'s rebellion against the [[Qin Empire]] which initially succeeded in restoring the kingdom of Chu but [[Chu-Han contention|eventually fell]] to the [[Han dynasty|Han]]. Under the [[Eastern Han|Later Han]], control of the area returned to the settlement below [[Mount Kuaiji]] but authority over the [[Minyue]] hinterland was nominal at best and its Yue inhabitants largely retained their own political and social structures.\n\nAt the beginning of the [[Three Kingdoms]] era (220\u2013280 CE), Zhejiang was home to the warlords [[Yan Baihu]] and [[Wang Lang]] prior to their defeat by [[Sun Ce]] and [[Sun Quan]], who eventually established the [[Eastern Wu|Kingdom of Wu]]. Despite the removal of their court from Kuaiji to [[Jiankang|Jianye]] (present-day [[Nanjing]]), and they continued development of the region and benefitted from influxes of refugees fleeing the turmoil in northern China. Industrial kilns were established and trade reached as far as [[Manchuria]] and [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]] ([[South Vietnam]]).\n\nZhejiang was part of the [[Eastern Wu|Wu]] during the [[Three Kingdoms]]. Wu (229\u2013280), commonly known as Eastern Wu or Sun Wu, had been the economically most developed state among the [[Three Kingdoms]] (220\u2013280 CE). The historical novel [[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]] records that Zhejiang had the best-equipped, strong navy force. The story depicts how the states of [[Wei (state)|Wei]] ({{lang|zh|\u9b4f}}) and [[Shu (state)|Shu]] ({{lang|zh|\u8700}}), lack of material resources, avoided direct confrontation with the Wu. In armed military conflicts with Wu, the two states relied intensively on tactics of camouflage and deception to steal Wu's military resources including arrows and bows.\n\n===Six Dynasties===\n\nDespite the continuing prominence of [[Nanjing]] (then known as Jiankang), the settlement of Qiantang, the former name of [[Hangzhou]], remained one of the three major metropolitan centers in the south to provide major tax revenue to the imperial centers in the north China. The other two centers in the south were Jiankang and [[Chengdu]]. In 589, Qiantang was raised in status and renamed [[Hangzhou]].\n\nFollowing the fall of [[Eastern Wu|Wu]] and the turmoil of the [[Wu Hu uprising]] against the [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)]], most of elite Chinese families had collaborated with the non-Chinese rulers and military conquerors in the north. Some may have lost social privilege, and took refuge in areas south to Yangtze River. Some of the Chinese refugees from north China might have resided in areas near [[Hangzhou]]. For example, the clan of [[Zhuge Liang]] (181\u2013234), a chancellor of the state of [[Shu Han]] from [[Central Plain (China)|Central Plain]] in north China during the [[Three Kingdoms]] period, gathered together at the suburb of [[Hangzhou]], forming an exclusive, closed village [[Zhuge Village]] (Zhege Cun), consisting of villagers all with family name \"Zhuge.\" The village has intentionally isolated itself from the surrounding communities for centuries to this day, and only recently came to be known in public. It suggests that a small number of powerful, elite Chinese refugees from the [[Central Plain (China)|Central Plain]] might have taken refugee in south of the Yangtze River. However, considering the mountainous geography and relative lack of agrarian lands in Zhejiang, most of these refugees might have resided in some areas in south China beyond Zhejiang, where fertile agrarian lands and metropolitan resources were available,  mainly southern [[Jiangsu]], eastern [[Fujian]], [[Jiangxi]], [[Hunan]], [[Anhui]], and provinces where less cohesive, organized regional governments had been in place. Metropolitan areas of [[Sichuan]] was another hub for refugees, given that the state of [[Shu (state)|Shu]] had long been founded and ruled by political and military elites from the Central Plain and north China. Some refugees from the north China might have found residence in south China depending on their social status and military power in the north. The [[Eastern Jin|rump Jin state]] or the [[Southern dynasties]] vied against some elite Chinese from the [[Central Plain (China)|Central Plain]] and south of the Yangtze River.\n\n===Sui and Tang eras===\nZhejiang, as the heartland of the [[Jiangnan]] (Yangtze River Delta), remained the wealthiest area during the [[Six Dynasties]] (220 or 222\u2013589), Sui, and Tang. After being incorporated into the [[Sui dynasty]], its economic richness was used for the [[Sui dynasty]]'s ambitions to expand north and south, particularly into [[Goguryeo\u2013Sui War|Korea]] and Vietnam. The plan led the [[Sui dynasty]] to restore and expand the network which became the [[Grand Canal of China]]. The Canal regularly transported grains and resources from Zhejiang, through its metropolitan center Hangzhou (and its hinterland along both the [[Zhe River]] and the shores of [[Hangzhou Bay]]), and from [[Suzhou]], and thence to the [[North China Plain]]. The d\u00e9b\u00e2cle of the Korean war led to Sui's overthrow by the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]], who then presided over a centuries-long golden age for the country. Zhejiang was an important economic center of the empire's [[Jiangnan]] East Circuit and was considered particularly prosperous. Throughout the [[Tang dynasty]], The Grand Canal had remained effective, transporting grains and material resources to [[North China plain]] and metropolitan centers of the empire. As the Tang dynasty disintegrated, Zhejiang constituted most of the territory of the regional kingdom of [[Wuyue]].\n\n===Wuyue era===\n[[File:QIAN_Liu_(aka_TSIEN_Liu),_King_of_Wuyue.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Portrait of [[Qian Liu]], the King of [[Wuyue]].]]\nAfter the collapse of the Tang dynasty in 907, the entire area of what is now Zhejiang fell under the control of the kingdom [[Wuyue]] established by King [[Qian Liu]], who selected [[Hangzhou]] (a city in the modern day area of Zhejiang) as his kingdom's capital. Despite being under Wuyue rule for a relatively short period of time, Zhejiang underwent a long period of financial and cultural prosperity which continued even after the kingdom fell.\n\nAfter Wuyue was conquered during the reunification of China, many shrines were erected across the former territories of Wuyue, mainly in Zhejiang, where the kings of Wuyue were memorialised, and sometimes, worshipped as being able to dictate weather and agriculture. Many of these shrines, known as \"Shrine of the Qian King\" or \"Temple to the Qian King,\" still remain today, with the most popularly visited example being that near [[West Lake]] in Hangzhou.\n \nChina's province of Zhejiang during the 940s was also the place of origin of the [[Hu (surname)|H\u00fa]] family (H\u1ed3 in Vietnamese) from which the founder of the [[H\u1ed3 Dynasty]] who ruled Vietnam, Emperor [[H\u1ed3 Qu\u00fd Ly]], came from.<ref name=\"Taylor2013\">{{cite book|author=K.

Under the Song, the prosperity of South China began to overtake that of North China.

Longquan greenware is characterized by a thick unctuous glaze of a particular bluish-green tint over an otherwise undecorated light-grey porcellaneous body that is delicately potted. Yuan Longquan celadons feature a thinner, greener glaze on larger vessels with decoration and shapes derived from Middle Eastern ceramic and metalwares. These were produced in large quantities for the Chinese export trade to Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and (during the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]]) Europe. By the Ming, however, production was notably deficient in quality. It is in this period that the Longquan kilns declined, to be eventually replaced in popularity and ceramic production by the kilns of [[Jingdezhen]] in [[Jiangxi]].<ref>Vainker, Shelaugh. <u>Chinese Pottery and Porcelain.</u> London: British Museum Press, 1991.</ref>\n\n===Yuan and Ming eras===\n[[File:Ceramic planter from the Ming Dynasty.jpg|thumb|This tripod planter from the [[Ming dynasty]] was found in Zhejiang province.

So far as my own observations go, after residing for a quarter of a century in half the provinces of China, north, south, east, and west, I should be inclined to describe slavery in China as totally invisible to the naked eye ; personal liberty is absolute where feebleness or ignorance do not expose the subject to the rapacity of mandarins, relatives, or speculators. Even savages and foreigners are welcomed as equals, so long as they conform unreservedly to Chinese custom. On the other hand, the oldfashioned social disabilities of policemen, barbers, and playactors still exist in the eyes of the law, though any idea of caste is totally absent therefrom, and \"unofficially\" these individuals are as good as any other free men.  Having now taken a cursory view of Chinese slavery from its historical aspect, let us see what it is in practice. Though the penal code forbids and annuls the sale into slavery of free persons, even by a husband, father, or grandfather, yet the number of free persons who are sold or sell themselves to escape starvation and misery is considerable. It is nominally a punishable offence to keep a free man or lost child as a slave; also for parents to sell their children without the consent of the latter, or to drown their girls; but in practice the law is in both cases ignored, and scarcely ever enforced ; ''a fortiori'' the minor offence of selling children, even with their consent. Indeed, sales of girls for secondary wives is of daily occurrence, and, as we have seen, the Emperors Yung-cheng and K'ien-lung explicitly recognized the right of parents to sell children in times of famine, whilst the missionaries unanimously bear witness to the fact that the public sale of children in the streets\u2014for instance, of Tientsin\u2014was frequently witnessed during recent times of dearth. But slave markets and public sales are unknown in a general way. Occasionally old parents sell their children in order to purchase coffins for themselves.

Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Nanking]], signed in 1843, Ningbo became one of the five Chinese [[treaty ports]] opened to virtually unrestricted foreign trade.  Much of Zhejiang came under the control of the [[Taiping Heavenly Kingdom]] during the [[Taiping Rebellion]], which resulted in a considerable loss of life in the north-western and central parts of the province, sparing the rest of Zhejiang from the disastrous depopulation that occurred.

The largest, [[Zhoushan Island]], is Mainland China's third largest island, after [[Hainan]] and [[Chongming Island|Chongming]]. There are also many bays, of which [[Hangzhou Bay]] is the largest.\n{{anchor|Climate}}\nZhejiang has a humid subtropical climate with four distinct seasons. Spring starts in March and is rainy with changeable weather. Summer, from June to September is long, hot, rainy, and humid. Fall is generally dry, warm and sunny. Winters are short but cold except in the far south. Average annual temperature is around {{convert|15|to|19|C|F}}, average January temperature is around {{convert|2|to|8|C|F}} and average July temperature is around {{convert|27|to|30|C|F}}. Annual precipitation is about {{convert|1000|to|1900|mm|0|abbr=on|sp=us}}. There is plenty of rainfall in early summer, and by late summer Zhejiang is directly threatened by [[typhoon]]s forming in the Pacific.\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n{{main|List of administrative divisions of Zhejiang|List of township-level divisions of Zhejiang}}\nZhejiang is divided into eleven [[prefecture-level division]]s: all [[Prefecture-level city|prefecture-level cities]] (including two [[Sub-provincial divisions in the People's Republic of China|sub-provincial cities]]):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1em auto 1em auto; width:90%; font-size:smaller; text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"9\" |'''Administrative divisions of Zhejiang'''\n|-\n| colspan=\"9\" style=\"font-size:larger\" | <div style=\"position: relative\" class=\"center\">\n{{Image label begin|image=Administrative Division Zhejiang.svg|width={{{1|648}}}|link=|font-size=85%}} \n{{Image label|x=300|y=310|scale={{{1|648}}}/1080|text='''[[Hangzhou]]'''}}\n{{Image label|x=710|y=360|scale={{{1|648}}}/1080|text='''[[Ningbo]]'''}}\n{{Image label|x=505|y=790|scale={{{1|648}}}/1080|text='''[[Wenzhou]]'''}}\n{{Image label|x=555|y=140|scale={{{1|648}}}/1080|text='''[[Jiaxing]]'''}}\n{{Image label|x=380|y=115|scale={{{1|648}}}/1080|text='''[[Huzhou]]'''}}\n{{Image label|x=525|y=360|scale={{{1|648}}}/1080|text='''[[Shaoxing]]'''}}\n{{Image label|x=395|y=500|scale={{{1|648}}}/1080|text='''[[Jinhua]]'''}}\n{{Image label|x=130|y=550|scale={{{1|648}}}/1080|text='''[[Quzhou]]'''}}\n{{Image label|x=840|y=280|scale={{{1|648}}}/1080|text='''[[Zhoushan]]'''}}\n{{Image label|x=630|y=580|scale={{{1|648}}}/1080|text='''[[Taizhou, Zhejiang|Taizhou]]'''}}\n{{Image label|x=310|y=720|scale={{{1|648}}}/1080|text='''[[Lishui]]'''}}\n</div>\n|-\n!! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[Administrative division codes of the People's Republic of China|Division code]]<ref>{{cite web |language=zh-hans |url=http://files2.mca.gov.cn/cws/201502/20150225163817214.html |script-title=zh:\u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u56fd\u53bf\u4ee5\u4e0a\u884c\u653f\u533a\u5212\u4ee3\u7801 |publisher=[[Ministry of Civil Affairs]] |access-date=11 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402113603/http://files2.mca.gov.cn/cws/201502/20150225163817214.html |archive-date=2 April 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n!! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Division\n!! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Area in km<sup>2</sup><ref name=\"nj2013\">{{zh}}{{cite book |language=zh-hans |author=Shenzhen Bureau of Statistics |publisher=China Statistics Print |script-title=zh:\u300a\u6df1\u5733\u7edf\u8ba1\u5e74\u92742014\u300b |url=http://www.sztj.gov.cn/nj2014/indexce.htm |date= |accessdate=2015-05-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512184740/http://www.sztj.gov.cn/nj2014/indexce.htm |archive-date=12 May 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n!! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Population 2010<ref>{{cite book| author1=Census Office of the State Council of the People's Republic of China| author2=Population and Employment Statistics Division of the National Bureau of Statistics of the People's Republic of China | script-title=zh:\u4e2d\u56fd2010\u4eba\u53e3\u666e\u67e5\u5206\u4e61\u3001\u9547\u3001\u8857\u9053\u8d44\u6599|date=2012|publisher=China Statistics Print|location=Beijing|isbn=978-7-5037-6660-2|edition=1}}</ref>\n!! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Seat\n!! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"4\" | Divisions<ref>{{cite book |language=zh-hans |author=Ministry of Civil Affairs |script-title=zh:\u300a\u4e2d\u56fd\u6c11\u653f\u7edf\u8ba1\u5e74\u92742014\u300b |date=August 2014 |publisher=China Statistics Print |isbn= 978-7-5037-7130-9|author-link=Ministry of Civil Affairs }}</ref>\n|-\n!! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:45px;\"| [[District (China)|Districts]]\n!! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:45px;\"| [[Counties of the People's Republic of China|Counties]]\n!! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:45px;\"| [[Autonomous counties of the People's Republic of China|Aut. counties]]\n!! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:45px;\"| [[County-level city|CL cities]]\n|- style=\"font-weight: bold\"\n! 330000 !!

The [[Governor of Zhejiang]] is the highest-ranking official in the People's Government of Zhejiang. However, in the province's dual party-government governing system, the Governor is subordinate to the Zhejiang [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) Provincial Committee Secretary, colloquially termed the \"Zhejiang [[CPC Party Chief]].\"\n\nSeveral political figures who served as Zhejiang's top political office of Communist Party Secretary have played key roles in various events in PRC history. [[Tan Zhenlin]] (term 1949-1952), the inaugural Party Secretary, was one of the leading voices against Mao's [[Cultural Revolution]] during the so-called [[February Countercurrent]] of 1967. [[Jiang Hua]] (term 1956-1968), was the \"chief justice\" on the Special Court in the case against the [[Gang of Four]] in 1980. Three provincial Party Secretaries since the 1990s have gone onto prominence at the national level. They include CPC General Secretary and President [[Xi Jinping]] (term 2002-2007), [[National People's Congress]] Chairman and former Vice-Premier [[Zhang Dejiang]] (term 1998-2002), and [[Zhao Hongzhu]] (term 2007-2012), the Deputy Secretary of the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]], China's top anti-corruption body. Of Zhejiang's fourteen Party Secretaries since 1949, none were native to the province.\n\nZhejiang was home to [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and many high-ranking officials in the [[Kuomintang]], who fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing the Civil War.\n\n== Economy ==\n[[File:Dayu Bay - YuAo Cun - P1210476.JPG|thumb|Yuao, a fishing village on Dayu Bay in south Zhejiang ([[Cangnan County]])]]\n\nZhejiang is one of the richest and most developed provinces in China. As of 2018, its [[Gross domestic product|nominal GDP]] was [[United States dollar|US$]]849 billion ([[Renminbi|CN\uffe5]] 5.62 trilion), about 6.24% of the country's GDP and ranked [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP|4th]] among [[Administrative divisions of China|province-level administrative units]]; the province's primary, secondary, and tertiary industries were worth CN\uffe5196.70 billion (US$29.72 billion), CN\uffe52.3506 trillion (US$355.22 billion), and CN\uffe53.0724 trillion (US$464.29 billion) respectively. Its nominal GDP per capita was US$14,907 (CN\uffe598,643) and ranked the [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP per capita|5th]] in the country. The private sector in the province has been playing an increasingly important role in boosting the regional economy since [[Chinese economic reform|Economic Reform]] in 1978.<ref name=\"SNA2008\"/>\n\nZhejiang's main manufacturing sectors are electromechanical industries, [[textiles]], chemical industries, food, and construction materials. In recent years Zhejiang has followed its own development model, dubbed the \"Zhejiang model,\" which is based on prioritizing and encouraging entrepreneurship, an emphasis on small businesses responsive to the whims of the market, large public investments into [[infrastructure]], and the production of low-cost goods in bulk for both domestic consumption and export. As a result, Zhejiang has made itself one of the richest provinces, and the \"Zhejiang spirit\" has become something of a legend within China. However, some economists now worry that this model is not sustainable, in that it is inefficient and places unreasonable demands on raw materials and public utilities, and also a dead end, in that the myriad small businesses in Zhejiang producing cheap goods in bulk are unable to move to more sophisticated or technologically more advanced industries.<ref name=\"thechinaperspective.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thechinaperspective.com/topics/province/zhejiang-province/ |title=China Economy @ China Perspective |publisher=Thechinaperspective.com |date=2013-09-06 |accessdate=2013-09-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008045925/http://thechinaperspective.com/topics/province/zhejiang-province/ |archive-date=8 October 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The economic heart of Zhejiang is moving from North Zhejiang, centered on Hangzhou, southeastward to the region centered on Wenzhou and Taizhou.<ref name=wiley/> The [[Per-Capita Disposable Income|per capita disposable income]] of urbanites in Zhejiang reached 55,574 yuan (US$8,398) in 2018, an annual real growth of 8.4%.

North Zhejiang, known as the \"Land of Fish and Rice,\" is characterized by its canals and waterways.]]\n\n===Languages===\nZhejiang is mountainous and has therefore fostered the development of many distinct local cultures. Linguistically speaking, Zhejiang is extremely diverse. Most inhabitants of Zhejiang speak [[Wu Chinese|Wu]], but the Wu dialects are very diverse, especially in the south, where one valley may speak a dialect completely unintelligible to the next valley a few kilometers away. Other [[varieties of Chinese]] are spoken as well, mostly along the borders; [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] and [[Huizhou Chinese|Huizhou]] dialects are spoken on the border with Anhui, while [[Min Chinese|Min]] dialects are spoken on the border with Fujian. (See [[Hangzhou dialect]], [[Shaoxing dialect]], [[Ningbo dialect]], [[Wenzhou dialect]], [[Taizhou dialect]], [[Jinhua dialect]], and [[Quzhou dialect]] for more information).\n\nThroughout history there have been a series of ''[[lingua franca]]s'' in the area to allow for better communication. The dialects spoken in Hangzhou, Shaoxing, and Ningbo have taken on this role historically. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]], which is not mutually intelligible with any of the local dialects, has been promoted as the standard language of communication throughout China. As a result, most of the population now can, to some degree, speak and comprehend Mandarin and can [[Code-switching|code-switch]] when necessary. A majority of the population educated since 1978 can speak Mandarin. Urban residents tend to be more fluent in Mandarin than rural people. Nevertheless, a Zhejiang accent is detectable in almost everyone from the area communicating in Mandarin, and the home dialect remains an important part of the everyday lives and cultural identities of most Zhejiang residents.\n\n===Music===\nZhejiang is the home of [[Yue opera]], one of the most prominent forms of [[Chinese opera]]. ''Yueju'' originated in [[Shengzhou]] and is traditionally performed by actresses only, in both male and female roles. Other important opera traditions include Yongju (of Ningbo), [[Shao opera]] (of [[Shaoxing]]), [[Ouju]] (of Wenzhou), [[Wuju]] (of [[Jinhua]]), Taizhou Luantan (of Taizhou) and Zhuji Luantan (of [[Zhuji]]).\n\n===Cuisine===\n[[File:Cangnan - Pacao - P1210261.JPG|thumb|Fish being dried dockside in Pacao Harbor, [[Cangnan County]]]]\nLongjing tea (also called dragon well tea), originating in Hangzhou, is one of the most prestigious, if not ''the'' most prestigious Chinese tea. Hangzhou is also renowned for its silk umbrellas and hand fans. [[Zhejiang cuisine]] (itself subdivided into many traditions, including Hangzhou cuisine) is one of the eight great traditions of [[Chinese cuisine]].\n\n===Place names===\nSince ancient times, north Zhejiang and neighbouring south Jiangsu have been famed for their prosperity and opulence{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}, and simply inserting north Zhejiang place names (Hangzhou, Jiaxing, etc.) into poetry gave an effect of dreaminess, a practice followed by many noted poets. In particular, the fame of Hangzhou (as well as [[Suzhou]] in neighbouring Jiangsu province) has led to the popular saying: \"Above there is heaven; below there is Suzhou and Hangzhou\" ({{zh|s=\u4e0a\u6709\u5929\u5802\uff0c\u4e0b\u6709\u82cf\u676d|labels=no}}), a saying that continues to be a source of pride for the people of these two still prosperous cities.\n\n== Tourism ==\n[[File:Guoqingsi006r.jpg|thumb|The Hall of Five Hundred [[Arhat]]s at [[Guoqing Temple]]]]\n\nTourist destinations in Zhejiang include:\n*[[Baoguo Temple (Ningbo)|Baoguo Temple]], one of the oldest intact wooden structures in Southern China, {{Convert|15|km|mi|sp=us}} north of Ningbo.\n*[[Mount Putuo]], one of the most noted Buddhist mountains in China.

romanized]] as '''Chekiang'''), is an [[East China|eastern]], coastal [[province of China|province]] of the [[China|People's Republic of China]]. Its capital and largest city is [[Hangzhou]]. Zhejiang is bordered by [[Jiangsu]] and [[Shanghai]] to the north, [[Anhui]] to the northwest, [[Jiangxi]] to the west, and [[Fujian]] to the south. To the east is the [[East China Sea]], beyond which lie the [[Ryukyu Islands]] of [[Japan]]. The population of Zhejiang stands at 57 million, the 10th highest among China. Other notable cities include [[Ningbo]] and [[Wenzhou]]. It has been called 'the backbone of China' due to being a major driving force in the Chinese economy and being the birthplace of several notable persons, including the [[Kuomintang|Chinese Nationalist]] leader [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and entrepreneur [[Jack Ma]].\n\nThe area of Zhejiang was controlled by the [[Yue (state)|Kingdom of Yue]] during the [[Spring and Autumn period]]. The [[Qin Empire]] later annexed it in 222 BC. Under the late [[Ming dynasty]] and the [[Qing dynasty]] that followed it, Zhejiang's ports became important centers of international trade. It was occupied by the [[Empire of Japan]] during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Second Sino-Japanese war]] and placed under the control of the Japanese puppet state known as the [[Reorganized National Government of China]]. After Japan's defeat, Zhejiang's economy became stagnant under [[Mao Zedong]]'s policies.<ref name=\"wiley\" />\n\nNevertheless, after [[Chinese economic reform|China's economic reform]], Zhejiang has grown to be considered one of China's wealthiest provinces, ranking [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP|fourth in GDP]] nationally and [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP per capita|fifth by GDP per capita]], with a nominal GDP of [[Renminbi|CN\uffe5]]5.62 trilion ([[United States dollar|US$]]849 billion) as of 2018. Zhejiang's economy is based on electromechanical industries, [[textiles]], chemical industries, food, and construction materials.\n\nZhejiang consists mostly of hills, which account for about 70% of its total area, with higher altitudes towards the south and the west. Zhejiang has China's longest [[coast]]line. The [[Qiantang River]] runs through the province, from which it derives its name. Included in the province are three thousand islands, the most in China. The capital [[Hangzhou]] marks the end of the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]], and lies on [[Hangzhou Bay]] on the north of Zhejiang, which separates [[Shanghai]] and [[Ningbo]]. The bay contains many small islands collectively called the [[Zhoushan Islands]].\n\n[[Hangzhou]] is a historically important city of China, and is considered a [[Global city|World City]] with a \"Beta+\" classification according to [[Globalization and World Cities Research Network|GaWC]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2018t.html|title=GaWC - The World According to GaWC 2018|website=www.lboro.ac.uk|access-date=2019-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170503165246/http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2016t.html|archive-date=3 May 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> It includes the notable [[West Lake]].

Instead, this area was populated by peoples collectively known as Dongyue and the [[Ouyue]].\n\nThe [[kingdom of Yue]] began to appear in the chronicles and records written during the [[Spring and Autumn period]]. According to the chronicles, the kingdom of Yue was in northern Zhejiang. [[Shiji]] claims that its leaders were descended from the [[Xia dynasty|Xia]] founder [[Yu the Great]]. The \"[[Song of the Yue Boatman]]\" ({{zh|c=\u8d8a\u4eba\u6b4c |p=Yu\u00e8r\u00e9n G\u0113 |l=Song of the man of Yue}}) was transliterated into Chinese and recorded by authors in north China or inland China of Hebei and Henan around 528 BC. The song shows that the Yue people spoke a language that was mutually unintelligible with the dialects spoken in north and inland China. The [[Sword of Goujian]] bears [[bird-worm seal script]]. [[Yuen\u00fc]] ({{zh|c=\u8d8a\u5973 |p=Yu\u00e8n\u01da |w=Y\u00fceh-n\u00fc |l=the Lady of Yue |links=no}}) was a swordswoman from the state of Yue. To check the growth of the [[Wu (state)|kingdom of Wu]], [[state of Chu|Chu]] pursued a policy of strengthening Yue.\n\nUnder [[Goujian|King Goujian]], Yue recovered from its early reverses and fully annexed the lands of its rival in {{nowrap|473 BC}}. The Yue kings then moved their capital center from their original home around [[Mount Kuaiji]] in present-day [[Shaoxing]] to the former Wu capital at present-day [[Suzhou]]. With no southern power to turn against Yue, Chu opposed it directly and, in 333&nbsp;BC, succeeded in destroying it. Yue's former lands were annexed by the [[Qin Empire]] in 222&nbsp;BC and organized into a [[commandery (China)|commandery]] named for Kuaiji in Zhejiang but initially headquartered in [[Wu County|Wu]] in [[Jiangsu]].\n\n===Han and the Three Kingdoms===\n[[Kuaiji Commandery]] was the initial power base for [[Xiang Liang]] and [[Xiang Yu]]'s rebellion against the [[Qin Empire]] which initially succeeded in restoring the kingdom of Chu but [[Chu-Han contention|eventually fell]] to the [[Han dynasty|Han]]. Under the [[Eastern Han|Later Han]], control of the area returned to the settlement below [[Mount Kuaiji]] but authority over the [[Minyue]] hinterland was nominal at best and its Yue inhabitants largely retained their own political and social structures.\n\nAt the beginning of the [[Three Kingdoms]] era (220\u2013280 CE), Zhejiang was home to the warlords [[Yan Baihu]] and [[Wang Lang]] prior to their defeat by [[Sun Ce]] and [[Sun Quan]], who eventually established the [[Eastern Wu|Kingdom of Wu]]. Despite the removal of their court from Kuaiji to [[Jiankang|Jianye]] (present-day [[Nanjing]]), and they continued development of the region and benefitted from influxes of refugees fleeing the turmoil in northern China. Industrial kilns were established and trade reached as far as [[Manchuria]] and [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]] ([[South Vietnam]]).\n\nZhejiang was part of the [[Eastern Wu|Wu]] during the [[Three Kingdoms]]. Wu (229\u2013280), commonly known as Eastern Wu or Sun Wu, had been the economically most developed state among the [[Three Kingdoms]] (220\u2013280 CE). The historical novel [[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]] records that Zhejiang had the best-equipped, strong navy force. The story depicts how the states of [[Wei (state)|Wei]] ({{lang|zh|\u9b4f}}) and [[Shu (state)|Shu]] ({{lang|zh|\u8700}}), lack of material resources, avoided direct confrontation with the Wu. In armed military conflicts with Wu, the two states relied intensively on tactics of camouflage and deception to steal Wu's military resources including arrows and bows.\n\n===Six Dynasties===\n\nDespite the continuing prominence of [[Nanjing]] (then known as Jiankang), the settlement of Qiantang, the former name of [[Hangzhou]], remained one of the three major metropolitan centers in the south to provide major tax revenue to the imperial centers in the north China. The other two centers in the south were Jiankang and [[Chengdu]]. In 589, Qiantang was raised in status and renamed [[Hangzhou]].\n\nFollowing the fall of [[Eastern Wu|Wu]] and the turmoil of the [[Wu Hu uprising]] against the [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)]], most of elite Chinese families had collaborated with the non-Chinese rulers and military conquerors in the north. Some may have lost social privilege, and took refuge in areas south to Yangtze River. Some of the Chinese refugees from north China might have resided in areas near [[Hangzhou]]. For example, the clan of [[Zhuge Liang]] (181\u2013234), a chancellor of the state of [[Shu Han]] from [[Central Plain (China)|Central Plain]] in north China during the [[Three Kingdoms]] period, gathered together at the suburb of [[Hangzhou]], forming an exclusive, closed village [[Zhuge Village]] (Zhege Cun), consisting of villagers all with family name \"Zhuge.\" The village has intentionally isolated itself from the surrounding communities for centuries to this day, and only recently came to be known in public. It suggests that a small number of powerful, elite Chinese refugees from the [[Central Plain (China)|Central Plain]] might have taken refugee in south of the Yangtze River. However, considering the mountainous geography and relative lack of agrarian lands in Zhejiang, most of these refugees might have resided in some areas in south China beyond Zhejiang, where fertile agrarian lands and metropolitan resources were available,  mainly southern [[Jiangsu]], eastern [[Fujian]], [[Jiangxi]], [[Hunan]], [[Anhui]], and provinces where less cohesive, organized regional governments had been in place. Metropolitan areas of [[Sichuan]] was another hub for refugees, given that the state of [[Shu (state)|Shu]] had long been founded and ruled by political and military elites from the Central Plain and north China. Some refugees from the north China might have found residence in south China depending on their social status and military power in the north. The [[Eastern Jin|rump Jin state]] or the [[Southern dynasties]] vied against some elite Chinese from the [[Central Plain (China)|Central Plain]] and south of the Yangtze River.\n\n===Sui and Tang eras===\nZhejiang, as the heartland of the [[Jiangnan]] (Yangtze River Delta), remained the wealthiest area during the [[Six Dynasties]] (220 or 222\u2013589), Sui, and Tang. After being incorporated into the [[Sui dynasty]], its economic richness was used for the [[Sui dynasty]]'s ambitions to expand north and south, particularly into [[Goguryeo\u2013Sui War|Korea]] and Vietnam. The plan led the [[Sui dynasty]] to restore and expand the network which became the [[Grand Canal of China]]. The Canal regularly transported grains and resources from Zhejiang, through its metropolitan center Hangzhou (and its hinterland along both the [[Zhe River]] and the shores of [[Hangzhou Bay]]), and from [[Suzhou]], and thence to the [[North China Plain]]. The d\u00e9b\u00e2cle of the Korean war led to Sui's overthrow by the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]], who then presided over a centuries-long golden age for the country. Zhejiang was an important economic center of the empire's [[Jiangnan]] East Circuit and was considered particularly prosperous. Throughout the [[Tang dynasty]], The Grand Canal had remained effective, transporting grains and material resources to [[North China plain]] and metropolitan centers of the empire. As the Tang dynasty disintegrated, Zhejiang constituted most of the territory of the regional kingdom of [[Wuyue]].\n\n===Wuyue era===\n[[File:QIAN_Liu_(aka_TSIEN_Liu),_King_of_Wuyue.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Portrait of [[Qian Liu]], the King of [[Wuyue]].]]\nAfter the collapse of the Tang dynasty in 907, the entire area of what is now Zhejiang fell under the control of the kingdom [[Wuyue]] established by King [[Qian Liu]], who selected [[Hangzhou]] (a city in the modern day area of Zhejiang) as his kingdom's capital. Despite being under Wuyue rule for a relatively short period of time, Zhejiang underwent a long period of financial and cultural prosperity which continued even after the kingdom fell.\n\nAfter Wuyue was conquered during the reunification of China, many shrines were erected across the former territories of Wuyue, mainly in Zhejiang, where the kings of Wuyue were memorialised, and sometimes, worshipped as being able to dictate weather and agriculture. Many of these shrines, known as \"Shrine of the Qian King\" or \"Temple to the Qian King,\" still remain today, with the most popularly visited example being that near [[West Lake]] in Hangzhou.\n \nChina's province of Zhejiang during the 940s was also the place of origin of the [[Hu (surname)|H\u00fa]] family (H\u1ed3 in Vietnamese) from which the founder of the [[H\u1ed3 Dynasty]] who ruled Vietnam, Emperor [[H\u1ed3 Qu\u00fd Ly]], came from.<ref name=\"Taylor2013\">{{cite book|author=K.

Under the Song, the prosperity of South China began to overtake that of North China. After the north was lost to the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] [[Jurchen Jin|Jin dynasty]] in 1127 following the [[Jingkang Incident]], Hangzhou became the capital of the Song dynasty under the name [[Hangzhou|Lin'an]], which was renowned for its prosperity and beauty, it was suspected to have been the largest city in the world at the time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa011201a.htm |title=Largest Cities Through History |publisher=Geography.about.com |date=2013-07-19 |accessdate=2013-09-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050527095609/http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa011201a.htm |archive-date=27 May 2005 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nFrom then on, northern Zhejiang and neighboring southern Jiangsu have been synonymous with luxury and opulence in Chinese culture.

Longquan greenware is characterized by a thick unctuous glaze of a particular bluish-green tint over an otherwise undecorated light-grey porcellaneous body that is delicately potted. Yuan Longquan celadons feature a thinner, greener glaze on larger vessels with decoration and shapes derived from Middle Eastern ceramic and metalwares. These were produced in large quantities for the Chinese export trade to Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and (during the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]]) Europe. By the Ming, however, production was notably deficient in quality. It is in this period that the Longquan kilns declined, to be eventually replaced in popularity and ceramic production by the kilns of [[Jingdezhen]] in [[Jiangxi]].<ref>Vainker, Shelaugh. <u>Chinese Pottery and Porcelain.</u> London: British Museum Press, 1991.</ref>\n\n===Yuan and Ming eras===\n[[File:Ceramic planter from the Ming Dynasty.jpg|thumb|This tripod planter from the [[Ming dynasty]] was found in Zhejiang province.

Zhejiang became part of the much larger [[Jiangzhe province]].\n\nThe [[Ming dynasty]], which drove out the Mongols in 1368, finally established the present day province of Zhejiang with its borders having little changes since this establishment.\n\nAs in other coastal provinces, number of fortresses were constructed along the Zhejiang coast during the early Ming to defend the land against [[wokou|pirate]] incursions. Some of them have been preserved or restored, such as [[Pucheng Township|Pucheng]] in the south of the province ([[Cangnan County]]).\n\n===Qing era===\nUnder the late Ming dynasty and the [[Qing dynasty]] that followed it, Zhejiang's ports were important centers of international trade.\n\n[[File:Dayu Bay - Shitang Cun - P1210531.JPG|thumb|left|A restored Qing era (1891) bridge on a coastal road]]\n\"In 1727 the to-min or 'idle people' of Cheh Kiang province (a [[Ningpo]] name still existing), the yoh-hu or 'music people' of [[Shanxi]] province, the si-min or 'small people' of Kiang Su (Jiangsu) province, and the [[Tanka people]] or 'egg-people' of [[Canton Province|Canton]] (to this day the boat population there), were all freed from their social disabilities, and allowed to count as free men.\"<ref>{{cite book|quote=the lot of both Manchu and Chinese bondsmen. In 1727 the to-min or \"idle people \" of Cheh Kiang province (a Ningpo name still existing), the yoh-hu or \" music people \" of Shan Si province, the si-min or \"small people \" of Kiang Su province, and the tan-ka or \"egg-people\" of Canton (to this day the boat population there), were all freed from their social disabilities, and allowed to count as free men. So far as my own observations go, after residing for a quarter of a century in half the provinces of China, north, south, east, and west, I should be inclined to describe slavery in China as totally invisible to the naked eye ; personal liberty is absolute where feebleness or ignorance do not expose the subject to the rapacity of mandarins, relatives, or speculators. Even savages and foreigners are welcomed as equals, so long as they conform unreservedly to Chinese custom. On the other hand, the oldfashioned social disabilities of policemen, barbers, and playactors still exist in the eyes of the law, though any idea of caste is totally absent therefrom, and \"unofficially\" these individuals are as good as any other free men.  Having now taken a cursory view of Chinese slavery from its historical aspect, let us see what it is in practice. Though the penal code forbids and annuls the sale into slavery of free persons, even by a husband, father, or grandfather, yet the number of free persons who are sold or sell themselves to escape starvation and misery is considerable. It is nominally a punishable offence to keep a free man or lost child as a slave; also for parents to sell their children without the consent of the latter, or to drown their girls; but in practice the law is in both cases ignored, and scarcely ever enforced ; ''a fortiori'' the minor offence of selling children, even with their consent. Indeed, sales of girls for secondary wives is of daily occurrence, and, as we have seen, the Emperors Yung-cheng and K'ien-lung explicitly recognized the right of parents to sell children in times of famine, whilst the missionaries unanimously bear witness to the fact that the public sale of children in the streets\u2014for instance, of Tientsin\u2014was frequently witnessed during recent times of dearth. But slave markets and public sales are unknown in a general way. Occasionally old parents sell their children in order to purchase coffins for themselves.

Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Nanking]], signed in 1843, Ningbo became one of the five Chinese [[treaty ports]] opened to virtually unrestricted foreign trade.  Much of Zhejiang came under the control of the [[Taiping Heavenly Kingdom]] during the [[Taiping Rebellion]], which resulted in a considerable loss of life in the north-western and central parts of the province, sparing the rest of Zhejiang from the disastrous depopulation that occurred. In 1876, [[Wenzhou]] became Zhejiang's second treaty port. [[Jianghuai Mandarin]] speakers later came to settle in these depopulated regions of northern Zhejiang.\n\n=== Republican era===\n\n{{See also|Chekiang Province, Republic of China}}\nDuring the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], which led into [[World War II]], much of Zhejiang was occupied by Japan and placed under the control of the Japanese puppet state known as the [[Reorganized National Government of China]]. Following the [[Doolittle Raid]], most of the B-25 American crews that came down in China eventually made it to safety with the help of Chinese civilians and soldiers. The Chinese people who helped them, however, paid dearly for sheltering the Americans. The [[Imperial Japanese Army]] began the [[Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign]] to intimidate the Chinese out of helping downed American airmen. The Japanese killed an estimated 250,000 civilians from the area of Hangzhou to [[Nanchang]] and also [[Zhuzhou]] while searching for Doolittle's men.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/perilousfight/ |title=PBS Perilous Flight |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910035849/http://www.pbs.org/perilousfight/ |archive-date=10 September 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== People's Republican era===\n\nAfter the People's Republic of China took control of [[Mainland China]] in 1949, the [[Republic of China]] government based in [[Taiwan]] continued to control the [[Dachen Islands]] off the coast of Zhejiang until 1955, even establishing a rival Zhejiang provincial government there, creating a situation similar to Fujian province today. During the [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966\u201376), Zhejiang was in chaos and disunity, and its economy was stagnant, especially during the high tide (1966\u201369) of the revolution. The agricultural policy favoring grain production at the expense of industrial and cash crops intensified economic hardships in the province. Mao's self-reliance policy and the reduction in maritime trade cut off the lifelines of the port cities of Ningbo and Wenzhou. While Mao invested heavily in railroads in interior China, no major railroads were built in South Zhejiang, where transportation remained poor.<ref name=wiley>{{cite journal|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/118764017/PDFSTART |title=Regional Inequality in China: A Case Study of Zhejiang Province |doi=10.1111/j.0040-747X.2004.00292.x |date=2004-02-16 |accessdate=2013-09-10 |volume=95 |journal=Tijdschrift voor Economische en Sociale Geografie |pages=44\u201360|last1=Wei |first1=Yehua Dennis |last2=Ye |first2=Xinyue }}{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nZhejiang benefited less from central government investment than some other provinces due to its lack of natural resources, a location vulnerable to potential flooding from the sea, and an economic base at the national average.

The [[Governor of Zhejiang]] is the highest-ranking official in the People's Government of Zhejiang. However, in the province's dual party-government governing system, the Governor is subordinate to the Zhejiang [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) Provincial Committee Secretary, colloquially termed the \"Zhejiang [[CPC Party Chief]].\"\n\nSeveral political figures who served as Zhejiang's top political office of Communist Party Secretary have played key roles in various events in PRC history. [[Tan Zhenlin]] (term 1949-1952), the inaugural Party Secretary, was one of the leading voices against Mao's [[Cultural Revolution]] during the so-called [[February Countercurrent]] of 1967. [[Jiang Hua]] (term 1956-1968), was the \"chief justice\" on the Special Court in the case against the [[Gang of Four]] in 1980. Three provincial Party Secretaries since the 1990s have gone onto prominence at the national level. They include CPC General Secretary and President [[Xi Jinping]] (term 2002-2007), [[National People's Congress]] Chairman and former Vice-Premier [[Zhang Dejiang]] (term 1998-2002), and [[Zhao Hongzhu]] (term 2007-2012), the Deputy Secretary of the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]], China's top anti-corruption body. Of Zhejiang's fourteen Party Secretaries since 1949, none were native to the province.\n\nZhejiang was home to [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and many high-ranking officials in the [[Kuomintang]], who fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing the Civil War.\n\n== Economy ==\n[[File:Dayu Bay - YuAo Cun - P1210476.JPG|thumb|Yuao, a fishing village on Dayu Bay in south Zhejiang ([[Cangnan County]])]]\n\nZhejiang is one of the richest and most developed provinces in China. As of 2018, its [[Gross domestic product|nominal GDP]] was [[United States dollar|US$]]849 billion ([[Renminbi|CN\uffe5]] 5.62 trilion), about 6.24% of the country's GDP and ranked [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP|4th]] among [[Administrative divisions of China|province-level administrative units]]; the province's primary, secondary, and tertiary industries were worth CN\uffe5196.70 billion (US$29.72 billion), CN\uffe52.3506 trillion (US$355.22 billion), and CN\uffe53.0724 trillion (US$464.29 billion) respectively. Its nominal GDP per capita was US$14,907 (CN\uffe598,643) and ranked the [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP per capita|5th]] in the country. The private sector in the province has been playing an increasingly important role in boosting the regional economy since [[Chinese economic reform|Economic Reform]] in 1978.<ref name=\"SNA2008\"/>\n\nZhejiang's main manufacturing sectors are electromechanical industries, [[textiles]], chemical industries, food, and construction materials. In recent years Zhejiang has followed its own development model, dubbed the \"Zhejiang model,\" which is based on prioritizing and encouraging entrepreneurship, an emphasis on small businesses responsive to the whims of the market, large public investments into [[infrastructure]], and the production of low-cost goods in bulk for both domestic consumption and export. As a result, Zhejiang has made itself one of the richest provinces, and the \"Zhejiang spirit\" has become something of a legend within China. However, some economists now worry that this model is not sustainable, in that it is inefficient and places unreasonable demands on raw materials and public utilities, and also a dead end, in that the myriad small businesses in Zhejiang producing cheap goods in bulk are unable to move to more sophisticated or technologically more advanced industries.<ref name=\"thechinaperspective.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thechinaperspective.com/topics/province/zhejiang-province/ |title=China Economy @ China Perspective |publisher=Thechinaperspective.com |date=2013-09-06 |accessdate=2013-09-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008045925/http://thechinaperspective.com/topics/province/zhejiang-province/ |archive-date=8 October 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The economic heart of Zhejiang is moving from North Zhejiang, centered on Hangzhou, southeastward to the region centered on Wenzhou and Taizhou.<ref name=wiley/> The [[Per-Capita Disposable Income|per capita disposable income]] of urbanites in Zhejiang reached 55,574 yuan (US$8,398) in 2018, an annual real growth of 8.4%.

North Zhejiang, known as the \"Land of Fish and Rice,\" is characterized by its canals and waterways.]]\n\n===Languages===\nZhejiang is mountainous and has therefore fostered the development of many distinct local cultures. Linguistically speaking, Zhejiang is extremely diverse. Most inhabitants of Zhejiang speak [[Wu Chinese|Wu]], but the Wu dialects are very diverse, especially in the south, where one valley may speak a dialect completely unintelligible to the next valley a few kilometers away. Other [[varieties of Chinese]] are spoken as well, mostly along the borders; [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] and [[Huizhou Chinese|Huizhou]] dialects are spoken on the border with Anhui, while [[Min Chinese|Min]] dialects are spoken on the border with Fujian. (See [[Hangzhou dialect]], [[Shaoxing dialect]], [[Ningbo dialect]], [[Wenzhou dialect]], [[Taizhou dialect]], [[Jinhua dialect]], and [[Quzhou dialect]] for more information).\n\nThroughout history there have been a series of ''[[lingua franca]]s'' in the area to allow for better communication. The dialects spoken in Hangzhou, Shaoxing, and Ningbo have taken on this role historically. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]], which is not mutually intelligible with any of the local dialects, has been promoted as the standard language of communication throughout China. As a result, most of the population now can, to some degree, speak and comprehend Mandarin and can [[Code-switching|code-switch]] when necessary. A majority of the population educated since 1978 can speak Mandarin. Urban residents tend to be more fluent in Mandarin than rural people. Nevertheless, a Zhejiang accent is detectable in almost everyone from the area communicating in Mandarin, and the home dialect remains an important part of the everyday lives and cultural identities of most Zhejiang residents.\n\n===Music===\nZhejiang is the home of [[Yue opera]], one of the most prominent forms of [[Chinese opera]]. ''Yueju'' originated in [[Shengzhou]] and is traditionally performed by actresses only, in both male and female roles. Other important opera traditions include Yongju (of Ningbo), [[Shao opera]] (of [[Shaoxing]]), [[Ouju]] (of Wenzhou), [[Wuju]] (of [[Jinhua]]), Taizhou Luantan (of Taizhou) and Zhuji Luantan (of [[Zhuji]]).\n\n===Cuisine===\n[[File:Cangnan - Pacao - P1210261.JPG|thumb|Fish being dried dockside in Pacao Harbor, [[Cangnan County]]]]\nLongjing tea (also called dragon well tea), originating in Hangzhou, is one of the most prestigious, if not ''the'' most prestigious Chinese tea. Hangzhou is also renowned for its silk umbrellas and hand fans. [[Zhejiang cuisine]] (itself subdivided into many traditions, including Hangzhou cuisine) is one of the eight great traditions of [[Chinese cuisine]].\n\n===Place names===\nSince ancient times, north Zhejiang and neighbouring south Jiangsu have been famed for their prosperity and opulence{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}, and simply inserting north Zhejiang place names (Hangzhou, Jiaxing, etc.) into poetry gave an effect of dreaminess, a practice followed by many noted poets.

The Upper Valdarno Basin has provided the remains of three fossil canid species dated to the Late [[Villafranchian]] era of Europe 1.9-1.8 million years ago that arrived with a faunal turnover around that time. The Swiss paleontologist [[Charles Immanuel Forsyth Major]] discovered two species in this region, these being the Falconer's wolf (''[[Canis falconeri]]'' Forsyth Major 1877) that was later reclassified as ''Lycaon falconeri'', and the smaller Etruscan wolf (''C. etruscus'' Forsyth Major 1877).<ref name=lucenti2016/> Forsyth Major did not publish a complete description of the Etruscan wolf,<ref name=\"cherin2014\"/> and later Domenico Del Campana worked on expanding Forsyth Major's descriptions when he recognized among the specimens a smaller, [[jackal]]-sized species.<ref name=\"cherin2014\"/> This he named the [[Canis arnensis|Arno River dog]]<ref name=lucenti2016/> (''C. arnensis'' Del Campana 1913) in honour of the nearby [[Arno]] river.<ref name=\"cherin2014\"/>\n\n===Type Specimen===\n[[File:Canis etruscus restoration.jpg|thumb|Artist's rendition]]\nThe [[Type (biology)#Lectotype|lectotype]] is a cranium from an unrecorded locality of Upper Valdarno.

In 2011, a study compared all of the fifty-five [[Early Pleistocene]] wolf-like specimens found across Europe and suggested that their morphometric variation was no different to that of modern wolf populations with their difference in size representing male and female specimens. However, the study proposed two lineages. One lineage is ''[[Canis arnensis|C. arnensis]]'' which includes ''C. accitanus'' and ''C. senezensis'', and the other lineage being ''C. etruscus'' that includes ''C. apolloniensis''.<ref name=brugal2011/> Other studies<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mart\u00ednez-Navarro, B., Belmaker, M., Bar-Yosef, O., 2009.|first=|date=|title=The large carnivores from \u2018Ubeidiya (early Pleistocene, Israel): biochronological and biogeographical implications.|url=|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|volume=56|pages=514-524|doi=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhevol.2009.02.004}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bartolini Lucenti, S., Alba, D.

The French archaeologist Jean-Philip Brugal proposes ''C. mosbachensis'' as a subspecies of ''C. etruscus'',<ref name=brugal2011/> and another French archaeologist [[Henry de Lumley]] considers ''C. mosbachensis'' to be a subspecies of the gray wolf and proposes a classification of ''C. lupus mosbachensis''.<ref name=lumley1988/>\n\n==Paleoecology==\nThe dispersal of carnivoran species occurred approximately 1.8 million years ago and this coincided with a decrease in precipitation and an increase of annual seasonality which followed the 41,000 year amplitude shift of [[Milankovitch cycles]]. First to arrive was ''C. etruscus'', which was immediately followed by ''C. arnensis'' and ''Lycaon falconeri'', and then the giant hyena ''[[Pachycrocuta]] brevirostri''. These were all better adapted to open, dry landscapes than the two more primitive canini [[Eucyon]] and [[Nyctereutes]] that they replaced in Europe.<ref name=cherin2014/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Wolf cranium labelled.jpg|thumb|300px|Diagram of a wolf skull with key features labelled]]\n\nA description of the Etruscan wolf appears below:\n<blockquote>Medium-sized dog (average size of a small ''C. lupus''); elongated snout; marked constriction of the snout beyond the infraorbital foramina; elongated nasal bones extending beyond the maxillofrontal suture; well-developed sagittal and nuchal crests; laterally enlarged occipital region; P1-P2-P3 laterally compressed; P1 with lingual cingulum; P3 normally with both posterior and accessory cusp (=modified posterior cingulum); large relative length of the upper molar row (in comparison with ''C. arnensis''); M1 with paracone more elevated than metacone; labial basin of M1 as deep as but larger than the lingual one; M1 and M2 with a continuous cingulum; reduced contact area between M1 and\nM2. Lower dentition characterized by larger dimensions in respect to ''C. arnensis'' and by a wolf-like M1/M2 ratio. The lower carnassial (M1) is distinguished by main trigonid cusps (protoconid and paraconid) relatively small (in comparison with ''C. lupus'') and by talonid cusps (hypoconid and entoconid) linked by a sinuous cristid.<ref name=cherin2014/></blockquote>\n\nDescribing ''C. etruscus'' as wolf-like and ''C. arnensis'' as jackal-like is therefore an over-simplification, because ''C. arnensis'' is more similar to ''C. lupus'' than is ''C. etruscus'' in some cranial characters.

The Swiss paleontologist [[Charles Immanuel Forsyth Major]] discovered two species in this region, these being the Falconer's wolf (''[[Canis falconeri]]'' Forsyth Major 1877) that was later reclassified as ''Lycaon falconeri'', and the smaller Etruscan wolf (''C. etruscus'' Forsyth Major 1877).<ref name=lucenti2016/> Forsyth Major did not publish a complete description of the Etruscan wolf,<ref name=\"cherin2014\"/> and later Domenico Del Campana worked on expanding Forsyth Major's descriptions when he recognized among the specimens a smaller, [[jackal]]-sized species.<ref name=\"cherin2014\"/> This he named the [[Canis arnensis|Arno River dog]]<ref name=lucenti2016/> (''C. arnensis'' Del Campana 1913) in honour of the nearby [[Arno]] river.<ref name=\"cherin2014\"/>\n\n===Type Specimen===\n[[File:Canis etruscus restoration.jpg|thumb|Artist's rendition]]\nThe [[Type (biology)#Lectotype|lectotype]] is a cranium from an unrecorded locality of Upper Valdarno. It is housed in the [[Montevarchi]] Paleontological Museum. The specimen has been designed as lectotype by the Italian paleontologist Danilo Torre in 1967 from the sample described by Forsyth Major.<ref name=cherin2014/>\n\n===''Canis apolloniensis''===\nOne specimen of ''C. apolloniensis'' (Koufos and Kostopoulos 1997) was found in site of Apollonia-1 near the village of Nea Apollonia, Macedonia, in northern Greece. The holotype consists of the rostral portion of a skull and a mandible. In 2011, a study compared all of the fifty-five [[Early Pleistocene]] wolf-like specimens found across Europe and suggested that their morphometric variation was no different to that of modern wolf populations with their difference in size representing male and female specimens. However, the study proposed two lineages. One lineage is ''[[Canis arnensis|C. arnensis]]'' which includes ''C. accitanus'' and ''C. senezensis'', and the other lineage being ''C. etruscus'' that includes ''C. apolloniensis''.<ref name=brugal2011/> Other studies<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mart\u00ednez-Navarro, B., Belmaker, M., Bar-Yosef, O., 2009.|first=|date=|title=The large carnivores from \u2018Ubeidiya (early Pleistocene, Israel): biochronological and biogeographical implications.|url=|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|volume=56|pages=514-524|doi=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhevol.2009.02.004}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bartolini Lucenti, S., Alba, D.

Considering morphological features retained by ''C. apolloniensis'', this species should be considered as a synonym of ''[[Canis mosbachensis|C. mosbachensis]]'' or a very affine taxon.   \n\n===Lineage===\nThe large wolf-sized ''Canis'' first appeared in the Middle [[Pliocene]] about 3 million years ago in the Yushe Basin, [[Shanxi]] Province, China. By 2.5 million years ago its range included the Nihewan Basin in [[Yangyuan County]], [[Hebei]], China and Kuruksay, Tajikistan.<ref name=vislobokova2003/> In Europe, ''C. etruscus'' first appeared 1.9-1.8 million years ago.<ref name=lucenti2016/> The lineage from ''C. etruscus'' to the [[Evolution of the wolf#Canis mosbachensis|Mosbach wolf]] (''C. mosbachensis'' Soergel, 1925) to the [[gray wolf]] (''C. lupus'') is widely accepted in the European scientific literature.<ref name=kurten1968/><ref name=sotnikova2010/><ref name=torre1967/><ref name=torre1974/><ref name=torre1979/><ref name=martin1973/><ref name=sotnikova1989/><ref name=rook1993/><ref name=sotnikova2001/> Nevertheless a recent publication<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bartolini Lucenti|first=Saverio|last2=Bukhsianidze|first2=Maia|last3=Mart\u00ednez-Navarro|first3=Bienvenido|last4=Lordkipanidze|first4=David|date=2020|title=The wolf from Dmanisi and Augmented Reality: review, implications and opportunities|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2020.00131/abstract|journal=Frontiers in Earth Science|language=English|volume=8|doi=10.3389/feart.2020.00131|issn=2296-6463}}</ref> has challenged this well-established hypothesis showing that the peculiarity of the ''C. etruscus'' (as shown by Cherin et al., 2014<ref name=\"cherin2014\" />) do not fit with those of more modern Early Pleistocene canids like ''C. borjgali'' from [[Dmanisi]], probably the ancestor wolf-like crown-clade species (''[[Wolf|C. lupus]]'', ''[[Coyote|C. latrans]]'', ''[[African golden wolf|C. lupaster]]''). The French archaeologist Jean-Philip Brugal proposes ''C. mosbachensis'' as a subspecies of ''C. etruscus'',<ref name=brugal2011/> and another French archaeologist [[Henry de Lumley]] considers ''C. mosbachensis'' to be a subspecies of the gray wolf and proposes a classification of ''C. lupus mosbachensis''.<ref name=lumley1988/>\n\n==Paleoecology==\nThe dispersal of carnivoran species occurred approximately 1.8 million years ago and this coincided with a decrease in precipitation and an increase of annual seasonality which followed the 41,000 year amplitude shift of [[Milankovitch cycles]]. First to arrive was ''C. etruscus'', which was immediately followed by ''C. arnensis'' and ''Lycaon falconeri'', and then the giant hyena ''[[Pachycrocuta]] brevirostri''. These were all better adapted to open, dry landscapes than the two more primitive canini [[Eucyon]] and [[Nyctereutes]] that they replaced in Europe.<ref name=cherin2014/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Wolf cranium labelled.jpg|thumb|300px|Diagram of a wolf skull with key features labelled]]\n\nA description of the Etruscan wolf appears below:\n<blockquote>Medium-sized dog (average size of a small ''C. lupus''); elongated snout; marked constriction of the snout beyond the infraorbital foramina; elongated nasal bones extending beyond the maxillofrontal suture; well-developed sagittal and nuchal crests; laterally enlarged occipital region; P1-P2-P3 laterally compressed; P1 with lingual cingulum; P3 normally with both posterior and accessory cusp (=modified posterior cingulum); large relative length of the upper molar row (in comparison with ''C. arnensis''); M1 with paracone more elevated than metacone; labial basin of M1 as deep as but larger than the lingual one; M1 and M2 with a continuous cingulum; reduced contact area between M1 and\nM2. Lower dentition characterized by larger dimensions in respect to ''C. arnensis'' and by a wolf-like M1/M2 ratio. The lower carnassial (M1) is distinguished by main trigonid cusps (protoconid and paraconid) relatively small (in comparison with ''C. lupus'') and by talonid cusps (hypoconid and entoconid) linked by a sinuous cristid.<ref name=cherin2014/></blockquote>\n\nDescribing ''C. etruscus'' as wolf-like and ''C. arnensis'' as jackal-like is therefore an over-simplification, because ''C. arnensis'' is more similar to ''C. lupus'' than is ''C. etruscus'' in some cranial characters. ''C. etruscus'' shows a set of peculiar features.<ref name=cherin2014/>\n\n==Range==\nIn the Early Pleistocene from Spain to China.<ref name=cherin2014/>\n\n==Extinction==\nThe Etruscan wolf and the Arno River dog both disappeared from the fossil record in Italy after the end of the Tasso Faunal Unit and were replaced by the mid-Pleistocene era Mosbach wolf (''C. mosbachensis'' Soergel, 1925) by 1.5 million years ago.<ref name=lucenti2016/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=brugal2011>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.quaint.2011.01.046|title=Quaternary small to large canids in Europe: Taxonomic status and biochronological contribution|journal=Quaternary International|volume=243|pages=171|year=2011|last1=Brugal|first1=Jean-Philip|last2=Boudadi-Maligne|first2=Myriam}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"cherin2014\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s10914-013-9227-4|title=Re-Defining Canis etruscus (Canidae, Mammalia): A New Look into the Evolutionary History of Early Pleistocene Dogs Resulting from the Outstanding Fossil Record from Pantalla (Italy)|journal=Journal of Mammalian Evolution|volume=21|pages=95|year=2013|last1=Cherin|first1=Marco|last2=Bert\u00e8|first2=Davide F.|last3=Rook|first3=Lorenzo|last4=Sardella|first4=Raffaele}}</ref>\n<ref name=cherin2014>{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s10914-013-9227-4|title=Re-Defining Canis etruscus (Canidae, Mammalia): A New Look into the Evolutionary History of Early Pleistocene Dogs Resulting from the Outstanding Fossil Record from Pantalla (Italy)|journal=Journal of Mammalian Evolution|volume=21|pages=95|year=2013|last1=Cherin|first1=Marco|last2=Bert\u00e8|first2=Davide F.|last3=Rook|first3=Lorenzo|last4=Sardella|first4=Raffaele}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=hall2014>{{cite book|last1=Hall|first1=Roberta L.|last2=Sharp|first2=Henry S.|title=Wolf and Man: Evolution in Parallel|date=10 May 2014|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=9781483267838|page=155|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tj60BQAAQBAJ&pg=PA155&dq=canis+arnensis#v=onepage&q=Arno&f=false|accessdate=27 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=koufos1997>Koufos, G.D., Kostopoulos, D., 1997b.
