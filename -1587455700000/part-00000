Biertan is one of the most important [[Saxon villages with fortified churches in Transylvania]], having been on the list of [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites]] since 1993. The [[Biertan fortified church]] was the see of the [[Lutheran]] [[Evangelical]] Bishop in [[Transylvania]] between 1572 and 1867.\n\nThe commune is composed of three villages: Biertan, Cop\u0219a Mare (''Gross-Kopisch''; ''Nagykapus'') and Richi\u0219 (''Reichesdorf''; ''Riomfalva''), each of which has a [[fortified church]].\n\n==History==\nThe first documentary testimony about the village dates from 1283 in a document about the taxes paid by the inhabitants of 7 villages and so it is believed to have been founded sometime between 1224 and 1283 by [[Transylvanian Saxons]]. The village settlement quickly developed into an important market town and by 1510 Biertan supported a population of about 5,000 people. Between 1468 and the 16th century a small [[fortified church]] (''die Kirchenburg'') was constructed and developed. After the medieval period the town declined in importance with the rise of neighbouring [[Sighi\u0219oara]] (or ''Sch\u00e4\u00dfburg'' in German), [[Sibiu]] (''Hermannstadt''), and [[Media\u0219]] (''Mediasch'').\n\nIn the census of 1930 Biertan had 2,331 inhabitants, of whom 1228 were [[Transylvanian Saxons]]. During [[World War II]] many men were conscripted into the [[Romania]]n army and later the [[Waffen-SS]]. After the war many [[Transylvanian Saxons]] were [[Deportation of Germans from Romania after World War II|expelled from the region]]. Following the collapse of [[Communism]] in 1990 many more left for [[Germany]].\n\nToday the whole commune has a population of about 2,500 and the village of Biertan alone has about 1,600 people. It is one of the most visited villages in [[Transylvania]], being the historically important place of the annual reunion of the [[Transylvanian Saxons]], many of whom now live in [[Germany]].\n\n==Festivals==\nThe [http://lunaplinafestival.ro/en \"Luna Plin\u0103\" (\"Full Moon\") Horror and Fantasy Film Festival] takes place in Biertan.

{"title_page": "Takfir", "text_new": "{{short description|Form of excommunication in Islam}}\n{{refimprove|date=November 2014}}\n{{Islam}}\n\n'''''Takfir''''' or '''''takfeer''''' ({{lang-ar|\u062a\u0643\u0641\u064a\u0631}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|takf\u012br}}'') is a controversial concept in [[Islamist]] discourse,<ref name=\"Jo\" /> denoting excommunication, as one [[Muslim]] declaring another Muslim, or any individual, as a non-believer (''[[kafir]]''). The act which precipitates takfir is termed ''mukaffir''. Contemporary formulation and usage of the term have their roots in the 20th-century Islamist theorist [[Sayyid Qutb]]'s advocacy of ''takfirism'' (doctrine of excommunication) against the state or society deemed ''[[jahiliyah]]'' (state of ignorance and disbelief). According to Qutb, violence is required to be sanctioned against corrupt state leaders, on the premise that [[Political quietism in Islam|quietism]] is not the Islamic prescription against those deemed [[apostate]]s. This position is widely held and applied by [[jihadist]] organizations to varying degrees. At the same time, the concept is opposed by religious establishment as an ostensible reason for violence.<ref name=\"Jo\">Karawan, Ibrahim A. (1995). \"Takf\u012br\". In John L. Esposito. ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Modern Islamic World''.

In general, the official clergy considers that Islam does not sanction excommunication of Muslims who profess their Islamic faith and perform the [[Five Pillars of Islam|ritual pillars of Islam]].<ref name=\"Jo\" /> This is due to takfir having major consequences of killing, confiscation of their property and denial of [[Islamic funeral|Islamic burial]]. [[Ulama]]s often raise objections by asking rhetorical questions of who holds the right to excommunicate others, on what religious criteria it should be based, and what level of specialized knowledge in Islamic jurisprudence (''[[fiqh]]'') is required for the qualification of authority.<ref name=\"Jo\" />\n\nSome Muslims consider takfir to be a prerogative of either the [[Muhammad|Prophet]] \u2014 who does that through Divine revelation \u2014 or the state which represents the collectivity of the ''[[Ummah]]'' (the whole Muslim community).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Asif Iftikhar |title=Murder, Manslaughter and Terrorism -- All in the Name of Allah |publisher=Renaissance.com |date=March\u2013April 1997 |volume=7 |issue=s. 3\u20134 |location=Al-Mawrid |url=http://www.renaissance.com.pk/maprtit97.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930155133/http://www.renaissance.com.pk/maprtit97.html |archivedate=2007-09-30 }}</ref> The declaration of takfir may be made if the alleged Muslim declares himself a ''kafir'', but more typically applies to a judgement that an action or statement by the alleged Muslim indicates his knowing abandonment of Islam.

The act which precipitates takfir is termed ''mukaffir''. Contemporary formulation and usage of the term have their roots in the 20th-century Islamist theorist [[Sayyid Qutb]]'s advocacy of ''takfirism'' (doctrine of excommunication) against the state or society deemed ''[[jahiliyah]]'' (state of ignorance and disbelief). According to Qutb, violence is required to be sanctioned against corrupt state leaders, on the premise that [[Political quietism in Islam|quietism]] is not the Islamic prescription against those deemed [[apostate]]s. This position is widely held and applied by [[jihadist]] organizations to varying degrees. At the same time, the concept is opposed by religious establishment as an ostensible reason for violence.<ref name=\"Jo\">Karawan, Ibrahim A. (1995). \"Takf\u012br\". In John L. Esposito.

Despite socialising with the likes of [[Nick Cave]] from [[The Birthday Party (band)#The Boys Next Door|The Boys Next Door]] they remained outsiders to this scene (most of which consisted of people from middle-class backgrounds with private-school educations), and in 1978 moved to [[Fitzroy, Victoria|Fitzroy]].\n\nIn Fitzroy, they settled on a four-piece lineup for recording and found like-minded friends, such as [[Ollie Olsen]] and [[John Murphy (musician)|John Murphy]] of [[Whirlywirld]]. They drew influence from [[proto-punk]] acts like [[The Godz (NYC band)|The Godz]] and [[The Velvet Underground]], Texan 1960s psychedelic punk, [[James Brown]], and [[The Silver Apples]], as well as Australian bands like [[Billy Thorpe and the Aztecs]].\n\nThe band were instrumental in organising a series of gigs named \"[[little band scene|Little Band]] nights\", where hastily formed bands would play for 15 minutes each; this led to the recording of a compilation [[Extended play|EP]]. They became known for their use of a screeching [[Mosrite]] Ventures model guitar, primitive [[synthesizer]]s (a Wasp and Roland SH2), an electronic organ played through effects pedals and an extra fast drum machine ([[Roland CR-78]]).\n\nThe Primitive Calculators played their last gig in March 1980, though their self-titled live album came out in the early 1980s. The band reformed briefly in 1986 to perform a live version of their song \"Pumping Ugly Muscle\" in the [[Richard Lowenstein]] film ''[[Dogs In Space]]'' (they later appeared in Lowenstein's 2009 documentary \"We're Livin' on Dog Food\").<ref name=\"Pat\" />\n\n===Second era===\nIn 2001, a 1979 live recording of \"Pumping Ugly Muscle\" was included in \"Can't Stop It\", a compilation of Australian post-punk bands from 1978 to 1982, released by [[Chapter Music]]. The title of the [[CD]] was taken from the Calculators' only studio recording, made in December 1979, which was a 7\" single of the songs \"I Can't Stop It\" and \"Do That Dance\". This led to a renewed interest in the band that led to the 2003 release of the ''Glitter Kids'' EP, which featured three live recordings from 1979, by Meeuw Muzik in the [[Netherlands]].\n\nThe Primitive Calculators' album was reissued on CD by Chapter Music in 2004, with the inclusion of extra tracks from related projects (their first band The Moths from 1978 and other live recordings from 1979). In March 2007, [[Chapter Music]] released \"Primitive Calculators and Friends, 1979 to 1982\", a CD that contained the only studio recordings of the band (the 7\" single from 1979), the \"Little Band\" single, also from 1979, and live tracks from Little Band nights. It also contained other recordings from bands the members formed after 1980, such as a song called \"Zye Ye Ye\" (recorded in London in 1981 with Olsen and Murphy), and bands formed after the return of some of the band members to Australia from Europe, in 1982.\n\nIn January 2009, the band reformed for the inaugural Australian [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] music festival, curated by [[Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds]] and held at [[Mount Buller, Victoria|Mount Buller]] in Victoria.<ref name=\"Pat\" /> The band subsequently commenced the recording of a new album, called ''The World Is Fucked'', released in 2013. Stuart Grant explained the album title in a December 2013 interview:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe album is called The World is F---ed because that's what we believe. The world's not any better now \u2013 in fact, it's worse. I can remember when the hippopotamus and rhinoceros weren't endangered species. I can remember when there was opposition, and when Chicago School economics wasn't a naturalised reality of life. And the anger in our music is because it doesn't need to be like that \u2013 and we don't need to be this nasty society.<ref name=\"Pat\" /></blockquote>\n\nGrant revealed that the band intends to record another album and stated: \"I want to make a psychedelic-space-folk record about taking hallucinogenic drugs.\"<ref name=\"Pat\" />\n\nMidway through recording their third LP Primitive Calculators were invited by [[Genjing Records]] and [[Split Works]] to play Jue Festival 2015 in Beijing and Shanghai. The band toured China also playing Xi\u2019an, Yiwu and Wuhan and released a tour edition split 7\" with activist noise artist Torturing Nurse. \n\nIn 2016, it Records released 'On Drugs', a single from Primitive Calculators forthcoming album by the same name.

There are traces of a later [[Thracians|Thracian]] settlement between the Kamaka (''The Stone'') Hill and the [[Arbanasi Plateau]]. Its inhabitants were from the tribe of ''Krobizi''. They erected the [[Kamaka Fortress]] that existed from the 5th century BC to the 1st century BC, when the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] built up their own fortified settlement over its ruins. It gradually acquired economic power mainly through cultivating grapes and producing wine. The life of that settlement continued up to the coming of the [[Slavs]] (6th\u20137th century). There is no substantial evidence of settled life between the 7th and the 12th century.\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nAfter the restoration of the Bulgarian State at the end of the 12th century, a need arose for protection of the new metropolis [[Tarnovgrad]]. Several fortresses were built, including [[Rahovets]] ({{convert|4|km|0|abbr=off}} northwest of the modern town). The main purpose of the strongholds was to protect the roads leading to the Bulgarian capital Tarnovgrad. The name ''Rahovets'' means 'road fortress' (from [[Persian language|Persian]] ''rah'', meaning 'road'). The medieval fortress gave its name to the modern town, even though with some Slavic twist. They were well known for their mushroom farming at the time. This proved to be a good method of income for the town.\n[[File:Rachovets fortress ruins,Gorna Oryahovitsa.jpg|thumb|Rachovets fortress ruins]]\nDuring the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] invasion, the fortress was conquered by the Ottomans after its water pipeline was cut off (without destroying the fortress). Rahovets existed up to the year 1444 when King [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Warne\u0144czyk]] during his campaign against the Ottomans destroyed it. Three individual small villages existed during the first centuries of Ottoman rule there\u2014Mala (Little), Sredna (Middle) and Golyama (Greater) Rahovitsa. It was known as \"Yukar\u0131 Rahova\" (\"Upper Rahovets\" in Turkish) during Ottoman rule.\n\n=== Development and growth ===\nDuring the [[Bulgarian National Revival]], Gorna Oryahovitsa gradually turned into an economically strong settlement. Crafts prospered and trade was among the most active in Northern Bulgaria. Every Friday there was a big market for cattle, agricultural production, timber, and charcoal. As early as 1822, a monastery school was opened here and in 1827 a private school that became public in 1835 began functioning. In 1850, the first girls' school opened gates and in 1859 the first intermediate high school was founded. A ''chitalishte'' (library and community centre) was opened in 1869. Gorna Oryahovitsa was proclaimed a town in 1870, when it numbered 4,700 inhabitants and had 1,200 houses and 5 churches.\n\n=== Revolutionary struggles ===\nThe population of the town took part in the struggle for national liberation. [[Vasil Levski]] organised a revolutionary committee in Gorna Oryahovitsa during the first half of 1869 and later visited the town two more times. During the preparation of the [[April uprising]] Gorna Oryahovitsa was designated as a centre of the First Revolutionary District with [[Stefan Stambolov]] as Chief Apostle. After the failure of the April Uprising, [[Georgi Izmirliev]] \"Makedoncheto\" (the Macedonian), one of the local leaders, was hanged in the centre of Gorna Oryahovitsa. His last words were: \"How good it is to die for the freedom of the Fatherland!\" Three citizens of Gorna Oryahovitsa fought in [[Hristo Botev]]'s detachment of armed volunteers and 132 people joined the Bulgarian volunteer forces during the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877-78|Russo-Turkish War of Liberation]]. The [[Imperial Russian Army]] liberated Gorna Oryahovitsa from Ottoman rule on 26 June 1877.\n[[File:International Fair in Gorna Oryahovitsa,1926.jpg|thumb|International Fair in Gorna Oryahovitsa]]\n\n=== Liberated Bulgaria ===\n\nAfter the Liberation, the town developed as a significant transport (predominantly railway) centre as it is nowadays.
