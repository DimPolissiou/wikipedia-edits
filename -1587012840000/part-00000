Bodmer XXIV, plate 26; in Qumran in fragment 4Q122).\n** Other examples in the Qumran texts show that the word '''\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9''' <kai> (\"and\") usually was separated with spacings \u2013 and this has nothing to do with the text's structure (as proposed by O'Callaghan).\n* The sequence '''\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3''' can be also found in the word \u03b5\u03b3\u03b5'''\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3'''\u03b5\u03bd <egennesen> (\"begot\"), which was the original suggestion as to its identity.\n** This suggestion was proposed by the authors of the fragment's first edition (''editio princeps'') published in 1962.\n** If so, the fragment likely would be part of a [[genealogy]] account.\n\nFurther counterarguments\n* To make the identification of the fragment with Mark 6:52-53, O'Callaghan had to substitute the letter '''\u03b4''' {{angbr|d}} with a '''\u03c4''' {{angbr|t}} in line 3, a substitution most scholars do not accept, although it is not without precedent in the ancient world.<ref name=\"wallace\">{{Clarify|date=September 2009}}\n* {{cite journal|first=Daniel|last=Wallace|title=7Q5: 'The Earliest NT Papyrus?'|journal=Biblical Studies|year=2000|url=http://www.bible.org/page.php?page_id=1196}} quoted at {{cite book|pages=252|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o7futW840scC&pg=PA252&vq=7q5&dq=7q5|first=Stephen L.|last=Cox|author2=Kendell H.

Additionally, as Robert Eisenman points out:\n<blockquote>Most scholars agree that the scrolls were deposited in the cave in or around 68 AD, but often mistake this date ... for the ''[[terminus ad quem]]'' for the deposit of the scrolls in the caves/cessation of Jewish habitation at the site, when it cannot be considered anything but the ''[[terminus ad quem|terminus a quo]]'' for both of these, i.e., not the latest but the ''earliest'' possible date for such a deposit and/or Jewish abandonment of the site. The actual ''terminus ad quem'' for both of these events, however difficult it may be to accept at first, is 136 AD.<ref>{{cite book|pages=129\u2013130|first=Robert|last=Eisenman|title=The Dead Sea Scrolls and the First Christians|publisher=Element Books, Inc.|year=1996|isbn=1-85230-785-4|location=Rockport, MA}}</ref> (''Italics in original.'')</blockquote>\n\nSo, for this is long after the currently accepted date range for the composition of [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], according to Eisenman this would mean that even if it could be proved that 7Q5 is a Mark's fragment, an earlier composition date for the gospel could not be proved.\nAlthough the fragment has been analysed and dated paleographically, as Brent Nongbri said, the dating of a such small fragment on account of paleography is not appropriate.<ref>[http://bible.org/article/7q5-earliest-nt-papyrus]. Alan Johnson: \"Why all the furor? What is at stake?

Bodmer XXIV, plate 26; in Qumran in fragment 4Q122).\n** Other examples in the Qumran texts show that the word '''\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9''' <kai> (\"and\") usually was separated with spacings \u2013 and this has nothing to do with the text's structure (as proposed by O'Callaghan).\n* The sequence '''\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3''' can be also found in the word \u03b5\u03b3\u03b5'''\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3'''\u03b5\u03bd <egennesen> (\"begot\"), which was the original suggestion as to its identity.\n** This suggestion was proposed by the authors of the fragment's first edition (''editio princeps'') published in 1962.\n** If so, the fragment likely would be part of a [[genealogy]] account.\n\nFurther counterarguments\n* To make the identification of the fragment with Mark 6:52-53, O'Callaghan had to substitute the letter '''\u03b4''' {{angbr|d}} with a '''\u03c4''' {{angbr|t}} in line 3, a substitution most scholars do not accept, although it is not without precedent in the ancient world.<ref name=\"wallace\">{{Clarify|date=September 2009}}\n* {{cite journal|first=Daniel|last=Wallace|title=7Q5: 'The Earliest NT Papyrus?'|journal=Biblical Studies|year=2000|url=http://www.bible.org/page.php?page_id=1196}} quoted at {{cite book|pages=252|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o7futW840scC&pg=PA252&vq=7q5&dq=7q5|first=Stephen L.|last=Cox|author2=Kendell H.

Additionally, as Robert Eisenman points out:\n<blockquote>Most scholars agree that the scrolls were deposited in the cave in or around 68 AD, but often mistake this date ... for the ''[[terminus ad quem]]'' for the deposit of the scrolls in the caves/cessation of Jewish habitation at the site, when it cannot be considered anything but the ''[[terminus ad quem|terminus a quo]]'' for both of these, i.e., not the latest but the ''earliest'' possible date for such a deposit and/or Jewish abandonment of the site. The actual ''terminus ad quem'' for both of these events, however difficult it may be to accept at first, is 136 AD.<ref>{{cite book|pages=129\u2013130|first=Robert|last=Eisenman|title=The Dead Sea Scrolls and the First Christians|publisher=Element Books, Inc.|year=1996|isbn=1-85230-785-4|location=Rockport, MA}}</ref> (''Italics in original.'')</blockquote>\n\nSo, for this is long after the currently accepted date range for the composition of [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], according to Eisenman this would mean that even if it could be proved that 7Q5 is a Mark's fragment, an earlier composition date for the gospel could not be proved.\nAlthough the fragment has been analysed and dated paleographically, as Brent Nongbri said, the dating of a such small fragment on account of paleography is not appropriate.<ref>[http://bible.org/article/7q5-earliest-nt-papyrus]. Alan Johnson: \"Why all the furor? What is at stake? A number of things: (1) If this identification is correct, it would be the earliest NT MS by some 50-100 years; (2) on paleographical grounds, since the upper limit of its date is 50 CE, this would put Mark in the 40s at the latest; [...]\".</ref>\n\n== Consequences ==\nIf one finds the missing link that conclusively determines the identity of 7Q5 (for example another fragment of the same corpus or another Greek text that ratifies the Ocallaghian identification or refutes it), different consequences can be foreseen.

They were also the plaintiffs in a landmark 1901 legal case heard by the [[Iowa Supreme Court]], ''Cherry v. Des Moines Leader,'' which was instrumental in establishing and confirming the right of the press to [[fair comment]]. [[File:Three of the Cherry Sisters - Addie, Jessie and Effie.jpg|thumb|Three of the Cherry Sisters siblings portrait.]]\nThe Cherry Sisters' vaudeville act, ''Something Good, Something Sad,'' was infamous for its poor quality and the vehement responses it elicited by audiences, who threw vegetables and disrupted performances. The sisters toured with the act for ten years, during which time they briefly appeared on Broadway. In 1898 they sued two Iowa newspapers for [[libel]] after they printed a scathing review of ''Something Good, Something Sad.'' The case eventually went to the Iowa Supreme Court, which ruled in the newspapers' favor and set a precedent for the right to fair comment.\n\nThe Cherry Sisters' act dissolved after the sudden death of the youngest member of the group, Jessie. The rest of the sisters went on to other ventures and opened a bakery, but died in modest circumstances.\n\n==Early life==\nThe Cherry sisters were the daughters of Thomas and Laura Cherry. The family was composed of eight children: Ella, Elizabeth, Addie, Effie, and Jessie, their brother Nathan, and two additional siblings who died at young ages. Ella, the eldest, was born in the early 1850s in Massachusetts, but the remainder of the children were born in Iowa, and were raised on a farm in [[Linn County, Iowa|Linn County]].<ref name=palm>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050201123735/http://www.iowacenterforthebook.org/air/2004/info-for-groups/cherry-sisters.htm \"The Cherry Sisters\"] Steven J.

Some of their songs featured new lyrics set to traditional standards; others were completely original compositions.

Spectators routinely laughed, heckled, catcalled, booed and threw vegetables at the sisters throughout the entire performance. In several instances the audience violence reached dangerous proportions: in one incident in [[Dubuque, Iowa|Dubuque]], a fire extinguisher was sprayed directly into one of the sisters' faces, and the show was stopped by the local marshals to prevent further harm.

The Cherry sisters did not consider the retraction to be sufficient and accused Davis of libel. The complaint resulted in a light-hearted mock trial onstage at a Cherry sisters performance in March 1893.<ref name=palm />\n\nIn 1898, the ''Odebolt Chronicle'' printed an extremely negative review of the Cherry sisters' act, titled \"The Cherries Were Here\".

They were also the plaintiffs in a landmark 1901 legal case heard by the [[Iowa Supreme Court]], ''Cherry v.

[[File:Three of the Cherry Sisters - Addie, Jessie and Effie.jpg|thumb|Three of the Cherry Sisters siblings portrait.]]\nThe Cherry Sisters' vaudeville act, ''Something Good, Something Sad,'' was infamous for its poor quality and the vehement responses it elicited by audiences, who threw vegetables and disrupted performances. The sisters toured with the act for ten years, during which time they briefly appeared on Broadway. In 1898 they sued two Iowa newspapers for [[libel]] after they printed a scathing review of ''Something Good, Something Sad.'' The case eventually went to the Iowa Supreme Court, which ruled in the newspapers' favor and set a precedent for the right to fair comment.\n\nThe Cherry Sisters' act dissolved after the sudden death of the youngest member of the group, Jessie.

The family was composed of eight children: Ella, Elizabeth, Addie, Effie, and Jessie, their brother Nathan, and two additional siblings who died at young ages. Ella, the eldest, was born in the early 1850s in Massachusetts, but the remainder of the children were born in Iowa, and were raised on a farm in [[Linn County, Iowa|Linn County]].<ref name=palm>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050201123735/http://www.iowacenterforthebook.org/air/2004/info-for-groups/cherry-sisters.htm \"The Cherry Sisters\"] Steven J.

In several instances the audience violence reached dangerous proportions: in one incident in [[Dubuque, Iowa|Dubuque]], a fire extinguisher was sprayed directly into one of the sisters' faces, and the show was stopped by the local marshals to prevent further harm.

Instead the density of the roads next to them determines the type of buildings that will be created there.

Unlike previous ''SimCity'' games, roads carry water, power, and sewage. There are also many new tools for drawing roads. They include a straight line tool, one for making rectangular road squares, one for making sweeping arcs, one for making circles, and one for making free-form roads. There is also a more diverse range of roads to choose from. Starting at dirt roads and going up to six lane avenues with street car tracks, the density of the roads determines the density of the buildings next to them, so dirt roads will only develop low density buildings. There are two different categories of roads, streets and avenues. Streets are 24 meters wide and avenues are 48 meters wide. Since all streets are the same width, a dirt road can be upgraded to a high density street. In order to upgrade a street to an avenue, one would need to fully demolish the old street and replace it with a larger avenue. When high and low capacity roads intersect, the higher density roads have the right-of-way, thus stop lights and stop signs will be automatically placed. In order to space the roads so there will be enough room for buildings to develop, road guides are shown when hovering over an existing road.<ref name=\"simcity1\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.simcity.com/en_US/blog/article/paving-the-way-simcitys-road-tool |title=Paving the Way: SimCity's Road Tool |publisher=Simcity.com |date= |accessdate=February 27, 2013}}</ref>\n\nPlayers will be able to specialize cities on certain industries, such as manufacturing, tourism, education, or others.

It was released on November 12, 2013 and is set 50 years in the future. It features new regions, technology, city specializations, and transportation methods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-simcity-expansion-launching-november-12/1100-6414713/|title=First SimCity expansion launching November 12|last=Makuch|first=Eddie|date=September 19, 2013|work=[[GameSpot]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=October 16, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe new features in ''Cities of Tomorrow'' are divided into three categories \u2013 \"MegaTowers\", \"Academy\" and the \"OmegaCo\". The MegaTowers are massive buildings built floor by floor with each floor having a specific purpose, being residential, commercial or to provide services like schools, security, power and entertainment. Each floor can provide jobs, services or housing for hundreds of citizens at the same time. The Academy is a futuristic research center that provides a signal called \"ControlNet\" to power up structures and improvements developed there and the OmegaCo is composed of factories used to produce an elusive commodity only known as \"Omega\" to increase the profits from residential, commercial and industrial buildings alike and manufacture drones to further improve the coverage of healthcare, police, fire services or just be used by citizens to perform shopping in their places, thus reducing traffic.\nThe expansion also supports \"futurization\", in which futuristic buildings tend to \"futurize\" the buildings, roads, and services around them by significantly blending the roads and buildings to simply make them look more futuristic, such as differences in traffic lights (they have a different sprite), turning service cars more futuristic (futurizing a police station will significantly change the cars and architecture), and so on. Buildings that will futurize the vicinity are distinguished with a hexagon pattern at the lower part of the building when viewed in the Construction screen.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Pre-release===\nAt [[E3 2012]] in June 2012, ''SimCity'' won 8 awards out of 24 nominations.<ref name=\"MaxisBlog\">{{cite web|url=http://www.simcity.com/en_US/blog/article/e3-redux|title=E3 Redux|publisher=Maxis|accessdate=December 5, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120213733/http://www.simcity.com/en_US/blog/article/e3-redux|archivedate=January 20, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref> On August 23, 2012, ''SimCity'' won [[Gamescom]]'s \"Best PC Game\" award.

As a result, some reviewers were unable to review the game, labeling the launch a \"disaster\" and the game as \"unplayably broken\", urging players to avoid purchasing the game until the issues were resolved.<ref name=\"Wired Outrage\">{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2013/03/simcity-outage/|title=SimCity Blackout Is Just One More DRM Disaster|publisher=Wired|author=Chris Kohler|date=March 8, 2013|accessdate=March 8, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2013/03/04/simcity-review-in-progress|title=SimCity Review in Progress|publisher=IGN|author=Dan Stapleton|date=March 4, 2013|accessdate=March 8, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:SimCity 2013 screenshot.png|thumb|left|A user-built city in ''SimCity'' that specializes in education]]\nAlong with many of the cosmetic changes (such as up-to-date 3D graphics), ''SimCity'' uses the new GlassBox engine. \"We try to build what you would expect to see, and that's the game,\" explains system architect Andrew Willmott, meaning that visual effects such as traffic, economic troubles, and pollution will be more obvious.

Instead the density of the roads next to them determines the type of buildings that will be created there.

Unlike previous ''SimCity'' games, roads carry water, power, and sewage. There are also many new tools for drawing roads. They include a straight line tool, one for making rectangular road squares, one for making sweeping arcs, one for making circles, and one for making free-form roads. There is also a more diverse range of roads to choose from. Starting at dirt roads and going up to six lane avenues with street car tracks, the density of the roads determines the density of the buildings next to them, so dirt roads will only develop low density buildings. There are two different categories of roads, streets and avenues. Streets are 24 meters wide and avenues are 48 meters wide. Since all streets are the same width, a dirt road can be upgraded to a high density street. In order to upgrade a street to an avenue, one would need to fully demolish the old street and replace it with a larger avenue. When high and low capacity roads intersect, the higher density roads have the right-of-way, thus stop lights and stop signs will be automatically placed. In order to space the roads so there will be enough room for buildings to develop, road guides are shown when hovering over an existing road.<ref name=\"simcity1\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.simcity.com/en_US/blog/article/paving-the-way-simcitys-road-tool |title=Paving the Way: SimCity's Road Tool |publisher=Simcity.com |date= |accessdate=February 27, 2013}}</ref>\n\nPlayers will be able to specialize cities on certain industries, such as manufacturing, tourism, education, or others.

It was released on November 12, 2013 and is set 50 years in the future. It features new regions, technology, city specializations, and transportation methods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-simcity-expansion-launching-november-12/1100-6414713/|title=First SimCity expansion launching November 12|last=Makuch|first=Eddie|date=September 19, 2013|work=[[GameSpot]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=October 16, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe new features in ''Cities of Tomorrow'' are divided into three categories \u2013 \"MegaTowers\", \"Academy\" and the \"OmegaCo\". The MegaTowers are massive buildings built floor by floor with each floor having a specific purpose, being residential, commercial or to provide services like schools, security, power and entertainment. Each floor can provide jobs, services or housing for hundreds of citizens at the same time. The Academy is a futuristic research center that provides a signal called \"ControlNet\" to power up structures and improvements developed there and the OmegaCo is composed of factories used to produce an elusive commodity only known as \"Omega\" to increase the profits from residential, commercial and industrial buildings alike and manufacture drones to further improve the coverage of healthcare, police, fire services or just be used by citizens to perform shopping in their places, thus reducing traffic.\nThe expansion also supports \"futurization\", in which futuristic buildings tend to \"futurize\" the buildings, roads, and services around them by significantly blending the roads and buildings to simply make them look more futuristic, such as differences in traffic lights (they have a different sprite), turning service cars more futuristic (futurizing a police station will significantly change the cars and architecture), and so on. Buildings that will futurize the vicinity are distinguished with a hexagon pattern at the lower part of the building when viewed in the Construction screen.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Pre-release===\nAt [[E3 2012]] in June 2012, ''SimCity'' won 8 awards out of 24 nominations.<ref name=\"MaxisBlog\">{{cite web|url=http://www.simcity.com/en_US/blog/article/e3-redux|title=E3 Redux|publisher=Maxis|accessdate=December 5, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120213733/http://www.simcity.com/en_US/blog/article/e3-redux|archivedate=January 20, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref> On August 23, 2012, ''SimCity'' won [[Gamescom]]'s \"Best PC Game\" award.

This type of hair style is best described as \"protective style\" and is \u201cboxy\u201d, consisting of square-shaped hair divisions. Box braids are generally created by using synthetic hair to help add thickness as well as supporting the real hair in the braid also. Because they are not attached to the scalp like other similar styles such as [[cornrows]], box braids can be styled in a number of different ways. The installation process of box braids can be lengthy, but once installed they can last for 6-8 weeks. They are known for being easy to maintain. However, these braids can also be done with natural hair.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hair.lovetoknow.com/black-hairstyles/what-are-box-braids|title=What Are Box Braids?|last=Cosmetologist|first=Terryn Kelly Licensed|website=LoveToKnow|language=en|access-date=2019-05-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/box-braids-hairstyles-photos_n_55e46c9ae4b0b7a9633989c8|title=20 Badass Box Braids Hairstyles That You Can Wear Year-Round|date=2015-08-31|website=HuffPost|language=en|access-date=2019-05-14}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nHair-braiding styles were used to help differentiate tribes, locations, and also possibly a symbol of wealth and power because of the amount of effort that went into styling braids.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.onchek.com/theinsight/6-popular-braiding-styles-their-true-origin/|title=6 POPULAR BRAIDING STYLES & THEIR TRUE ORIGIN|website=ONCHEK|access-date=2019-05-14}}</ref> Box braids were not given a specific name until the 1990s when popularised by [[Janet Jackson]], but have been used for centuries. This style of braiding comes from the Eembuvi braids of [[Namibia]] or the chin-length bob braids of the women of the [[Nile valley|Nile Valley]] from over 3,000 years ago.<ref name=\":0\" /> The elders in the tribes would teach the young children how to braid each other's hair, and this became a social activity for the tribes.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://blackhairspot.com/blog/hair-talk/how-to-box-braids/|title=Your all-you-need-guide on How to do Box Braids|last=Nxumalo|first=Lethabo|date=2018-01-14|website=Black Hair Spot|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-14}}</ref> In Africa, braid styles and patterns are a way of distinguishing the different tribes, marital status, age, wealth, religion and social ranking. In some parts of Africa, the braids were a form of communication. In some Caribbean islands, braids were used as a way to escape slavery by forming intricate braid patterns that signified a map.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} To achieve the braids, the tribes would typically use thick layers of finely chopped tree bark and oils to base and uphold the hairstyle. Human hair was at one point wefted into fiber skull caps made of durable materials like wool and felt for reuse in traditional clothing as well as various rituals.<ref name=\":0\" /> Cowrie shells, jewels, beads and other meaningful items adorned box braids of earlier women alluding to their readiness to have children, emulation of wealth, high priesthood and various other classifications.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Cultural association and value==\n\nHair was and is a very important and symbolic part of different African communities. Africans believed that hair could help with divine communication as it was the elevated part of one's body.

This type of hair style is best described as \"protective style\" and is \u201cboxy\u201d, consisting of square-shaped hair divisions. Box braids are generally created by using synthetic hair to help add thickness as well as supporting the real hair in the braid also. Because they are not attached to the scalp like other similar styles such as [[cornrows]], box braids can be styled in a number of different ways. The installation process of box braids can be lengthy, but once installed they can last for 6-8 weeks. They are known for being easy to maintain. However, these braids can also be done with natural hair.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hair.lovetoknow.com/black-hairstyles/what-are-box-braids|title=What Are Box Braids?|last=Cosmetologist|first=Terryn Kelly Licensed|website=LoveToKnow|language=en|access-date=2019-05-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/box-braids-hairstyles-photos_n_55e46c9ae4b0b7a9633989c8|title=20 Badass Box Braids Hairstyles That You Can Wear Year-Round|date=2015-08-31|website=HuffPost|language=en|access-date=2019-05-14}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nHair-braiding styles were used to help differentiate tribes, locations, and also possibly a symbol of wealth and power because of the amount of effort that went into styling braids.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.onchek.com/theinsight/6-popular-braiding-styles-their-true-origin/|title=6 POPULAR BRAIDING STYLES & THEIR TRUE ORIGIN|website=ONCHEK|access-date=2019-05-14}}</ref> Box braids were not given a specific name until the 1990s when popularised by [[Janet Jackson]], but have been used for centuries.

In some Caribbean islands, braids were used as a way to escape slavery by forming intricate braid patterns that signified a map.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} To achieve the braids, the tribes would typically use thick layers of finely chopped tree bark and oils to base and uphold the hairstyle.

It stars [[Natalie Brown (actress)|Natalie Brown]], [[Melanie Lynskey]], [[Breeda Wool]] and [[Christina Kirk]]. It had its world premiere at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] on January 22, 2017, and was released in a [[limited release]] and through [[video on demand]] by [[Magnet Releasing]] on February 17, 2017.\n\n==Plot==\n===Framing sequence===\nDirected by Sofia Carrillo\n\nThe anthology is framed by stop-motion-animated segments depicting a walking dollhouse with a blinking doll face on it. A doll hand separate, but also living, moves from its drawer and scurries around collecting items the dollhouse finds. Within its interior, various objects and items are shown including: a cabinet where bugs and moths enter acting as a stomach of sorts, a room with living sewing needles that make tiny tapestries, and a room with a morphing apple that seems to act as the dollhouse's heart. Eventually, the dollhouse finds a small blackbird (whether it is stuffed or an actual dead bird is ambiguous). The dollhouse places the bird into a baby doll and upon it crying immediately removes the bird and enters a room with an unconscious girl. The girl has a small door on her chest and the dollhouse places the bird inside it. After a while, the girl awakens, pleasing the dollhouse.\n\n===The Box===\nWritten and directed by Jovanka Vuckovic, based on the short story by [[Jack Ketchum]]\n\nWhile riding on a train with his mother Susan, a young boy, Danny, sees an old man with a red box; the old man describes it as \"a present\" and allows Danny to look inside. After looking, Danny refuses to eat any food presented to him. Susan and her husband Robert start to worry about him, taking him to a doctor who finds that Danny has lost five pounds since his last checkup. Danny speaks with his sister Jenny, and soon after, she refuses to eat as well. Robert attempts to speak to Danny about his refusal to eat, but Danny whispers something in his ear, which causes Robert to start refusing food.\n\nSusan is haunted by a dream of her family happily eating her at the dinner table. When she sees Danny, Jenny and Robert eating happily, Susan smiles, happy that her husband and kids are finally eating again.\n\nCome Christmas, Danny, Jenny, and Robert are all emaciated, but don't seem to mind. Danny hands Susan a present wrapped in a red box. Susan recalls the incident on the train and connects the dots. When Susan asks Danny what was in the box, he tells her it was \"nothing.\" Susan reveals in a voice-over that all three members of her family later died of starvation: Danny first, then Jenny, then Robert. She is now searching the trains for the man with the box, still wanting to know what is inside, as she feels it is the only way to get close to her family now.\n\n===The Birthday Party===\nWritten by [[Roxanne Benjamin]] and [[St. Vincent (musician)|Annie Clark]], directed by Annie Clark\n\nMary is attempting to hold a birthday party for her daughter Lucy, but when she finds her husband David dead in his home office, she decides to hide the body instead of calling 911. She spends the day frantically trying to conceal David's body from Lucy, nanny Carla, and neighbor Madeleine. She finally buys a panda costume off of a man who comes to sing Lucy a birthday song, and hides the body in the costume.\n\nDuring the party, Mary does not have time to move the costumed body and is forced to set it up on a seat at the table. Carla bumps the costume, causing it to collapse into Lucy's birthday cake. The body is discovered when Carla, attempting to lift the Panda, accidentally removes the head, and the full title of the film is revealed as the children scream in terror: ''The Birthday Party, or, The Memory Lucy Suppressed From Her Seventh Birthday That Wasn't Really Her Mom's Fault (Even Though Her Therapist Says It's Probably Why She Fears Intimacy)''.\n\n===Don't Fall===\nWritten and directed by Roxanne Benjamin\n\nFour DUMB friends - Paul, Gretchen, Jess, and Jay - are all on an expedition out in the desert. Gretchen is afraid of heights. The four discover an ancient cave painting depicting an evil spirit before camping out for the night. Gretchen is attacked by a creature similar to the spirit in the painting, which takes over her body and wears her skin. It kills Paul and Jay before chasing Jess, who then falls and breaks her leg. The Gretchen-creature then descends a cliff to kill Jess.\n\n===Her Only Living Son===\nWritten and directed by [[Karyn Kusama]]\n\nSingle mother Cora's rebellious son, Andy, is about to turn 18. She is called into Andy's school to meet with the principal regarding an incident in which Andy tore off a classmate's fingernails. The principal apologizes to Cora that she had to witness an \"outburst\" from the classmate's mother, and tells Cora that her son is remarkable. Cora is deeply unnerved that her son appears to have entranced his superiors.\n\nCora's mailman Chet hints that Andy is not necessarily her distant former husband's (an actor) son. Andy - whose voice has changed and finger and toenails have become claws - confirms her suspicions: he is transforming into the spawn of Satan, something she has worried about since before his birth. Andy, embracing his father's power, forces Cora to bow down to him as Satan enters the house to reclaim him, but she then embraces and quickly tells her son the reason they went into hiding, and asserts that she refuses to give up Andy to his father. Andy, moved, chooses her over his destiny. The two hold each other tight as their bones crack and blood seeps from their noses and mouths until they die from Satan's assault.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* The Box\n** [[Natalie Brown (actress)|Natalie Brown]] as Susan Jacobs\n** [[Jonathan Watton]] as Robert Jacobs\n** [[Peter DaCunha]] as Danny Jacobs\n** [[Peyton Kennedy]] as Jenny Jacobs\n** [[Ron Lea]] as Dr. Weller\n** Michael Dyson as The Man\n* The Birthday Party\n** [[Melanie Lynskey]] as Mary\n** Seth Duhame as David\n** Sanai Victoria as Lucy\n** [[Sheila Vand]] as Carla\n** [[Lindsay Burdge]] as Madeleine\n** [[Joe Swanberg]] as Singing Panda <small>(Uncredited)</small>\n* Don't Fall\n** Casey Adams as Paul\n** [[Breeda Wool]] as Gretchen\n** [[Angela Trimbur]] as Jess\n** Morgan Krantz as Jay\n* Her Only Living Son\n** [[Christina Kirk]] as Cora\n** Kyle Allen as Andy\n** [[Mike Doyle (actor)|Mike Doyle]] as Chet\n** Brenda Wehle as Principal Jenks\n** Morgan Peter Brown as Mr. Dayton\n** Lisa Renee Pitts as Kelly Withers\n** Curt Cornelius as Dr. Roman\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nIn October 2014, it was announced [[Karyn Kusama]], [[Mary Harron]], [[Jennifer Lynch]] and Jovanka Vuckovic would direct the horror-anthology film, while [[Magnet Releasing]] would distribute the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2014/10/magnet-female-horror-anthology-xx-848156/|title=Magnet Springs For Femme-Driven Horror Anthology \u2018XX\u2019|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|first=Jen|last=Yamato|date=October 8, 2014|accessdate=January 12, 2017}}</ref> In April 2016, it was announced musician [[St. Vincent (musician)|St. Vincent]] would also direct a segment, making her directorial debut.

These two were followed in service by the similarly-named [[Airspeed Queen Wasp]] and [[Miles Martinet|Miles Queen Martinet]], before ultimate replacement by the [[GAF Jindivik]].<ref>Note; the term \"[[Drone (bee)|drone]]\" refers to the male bee that serves only to fertilize the [[queen bee]], hence the use of the name in reference to the DH Queen Bee aerial target.</ref>\n\nThe term ''unmanned aircraft system'' ('''UAS''') was adopted by the [[United States Department of Defense]] (DoD) and the United States [[Federal Aviation Administration]] in 2005 according to their Unmanned Aircraft System Roadmap 2005\u20132030.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.acq.osd.mil/usd/Roadmap%20Final2.pdf#search=%22Dod%20UAS%20Roadmap%202005%22|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002220516/http://www.acq.osd.mil/usd/Roadmap%20Final2.pdf#search=%22Dod%20UAS%20Roadmap%202005%22|url-status=dead|title=Unmanned Aircraft Systems Roadmap.|archivedate=2 October 2008}}</ref> The [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO) and the [[Civil Aviation Authority (United Kingdom)|British Civil Aviation Authority]] adopted this term, also used in the European Union's [[SESAR Joint Undertaking|Single-European-Sky (SES) Air-Traffic-Management (ATM) Research]] (SESAR Joint Undertaking) roadmap for 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|title = European ATM Master Plan 2015 {{!}} SESAR|url = http://www.sesarju.eu/newsroom/brochures-publications/european-atm-master-plan-2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160206104147/http://www.sesarju.eu/newsroom/brochures-publications/european-atm-master-plan-2015|url-status = dead|archive-date = 6 February 2016|website = www.sesarju.eu|access-date = 3 February 2016}}</ref> This term emphasizes the importance of elements other than the aircraft. It includes elements such as ground control stations, data links and other support equipment. A similar term is an ''unmanned-aircraft vehicle system'' (UAVS), ''remotely piloted aerial vehicle'' (RPAV), ''remotely piloted aircraft system'' (RPAS).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spatialsource.com.au/unmanned/state-government-gears-autonomous-rpas-mapping|title=State government gears up for autonomous RPAS mapping|date=23 January 2017}}</ref> Many similar terms are in use.\n\nA UAV is defined as a \"powered, aerial vehicle that does not carry a human operator, uses [[Aerodynamic force|aerodynamic forces]] to provide vehicle lift, can fly autonomously or be piloted remotely, can be expendable or recoverable, and can carry a lethal or nonlethal payload\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Unmanned+Aerial+Vehicle|title=unmanned aerial vehicle|work=TheFreeDictionary.com|accessdate=8 January 2015}}</ref> Therefore, [[missile]]s are not considered UAVs because the vehicle itself is a weapon that is not reused, though it is also uncrewed and in some cases remotely guided.

This could stem from the fact that many UAVs are automated, i.e. they carry out automated missions but still rely on human operators. However, an autonomous drone is a \u201cUAV that can operate without any human intervention\u201d.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Avitan |first1=Ariel |title=The Differences Between UAV, UAS, and Autonomous Drones |url=https://percepto.co/what-are-the-differences-between-uav-uas-and-autonomous-drones/ |website=Percepto |accessdate=16 April 2020 |date=3 January 2019}}</ref> In other words, autonomous drones take off, carry out missions, and land completely autonomously.

Some jurisdictions base their definition on size or weight; however, the US [[Federal Aviation Administration]] defines any uncrewed flying craft as a UAV regardless of size.

The main exceptions are the [[cockpit]] and [[Environmental control system (aircraft)|environmental control system]] or [[life support system]]s. Some UAVs carry payloads (such as a camera) that weigh considerably less than an adult human, and as a result can be considerably smaller. Though they carry heavy payloads, weaponized military UAVs are lighter than their crewed counterparts with comparable armaments.\n\nSmall civilian UAVs have no [[life-critical system]]s, and can thus be built out of lighter but less sturdy materials and shapes, and can use less robustly tested electronic control systems. For small UAVs, the [[quadcopter]] design has become popular, though this layout is rarely used for crewed aircraft. Miniaturization means that less-powerful propulsion technologies can be used that are not feasible for crewed aircraft, such as small electric motors and batteries.\n\nControl systems for UAVs are often different than crewed craft. For remote human control, a camera and video link almost always replace the cockpit windows; radio-transmitted digital commands replace physical cockpit controls. [[Autopilot]] software is used on both crewed and uncrewed aircraft, with varying feature sets.\n\n===Body===\nThe primary difference for planes is the absence of the cockpit area and its windows. Tailless quadcopters are a common form factor for rotary wing UAVs while tailed mono- and bi-copters are common for crewed platforms.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/amp/2016/10/02/hybrid-drone-flies-with-one-propeller/|title=Drone flies as both biplane and helicopter using one propeller|website=Engadget}}</ref>\n\n===Power supply and platform===\nSmall UAVs mostly use [[Lithium polymer battery|lithium-polymer batteries]] (Li-Po), while larger vehicles rely on conventional airplane engines. Scale or size of aircraft is not the defining or limiting characteristic of energy supply for a UAV. At present,{{when|date=August 2018}} the energy density of Li-Po is far less than gasoline. The record of travel for a UAV (built from balsa wood and mylar skin) across the North Atlantic Ocean is held by a gasoline model airplane or UAV. Manard Hill in \"in 2003 when one of his creations flew 1,882 miles across the Atlantic Ocean on less than a gallon of fuel\" holds this record. See:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/model-airplane-history-maker-maynard-hill-dies-at-the-age-of-85/2011/06/08/AGcnyQNH_story.html|title=Model airplane history-maker Maynard Hill dies at the age of 85|website=Washington Post}}</ref> Electric power is used as less work is required for a flight and electric motors are quieter. Also, properly designed, the thrust to weight ratio for an electric or gasoline motor driving a propeller can hover or climb vertically.

Early UAVs had only [[narrowband]] uplink. Downlinks came later. These bi-directional narrowband radio links carried command and control (C&C) and [[telemetry]] data about the status of aircraft systems to the remote operator. For very long range flights, military UAVs also use [[satellite]] receivers as part of [[satellite navigation]] systems. In cases when video transmission was required, the UAVs will implement a separate analog video radio link.\n\nIn the most modern UAV applications, video transmission is required. So instead of having 2 separate links for C&C, telemetry and video traffic, a [[broadband]] link is used to carry all types of data on a single radio link. These broadband links can leverage [[quality of service]] techniques to optimize the C&C traffic for low latency. Usually these broadband links carry [[TCP/IP]] traffic that can be routed over the Internet.\n\nThe radio signal from the operator side can be issued from either:\n\n* Ground control \u2013 a human operating a [[Transmitter|radio transmitter]]/receiver, a smartphone, a tablet, a computer, or the original meaning of a [[Ground control station|military ground control station (GCS)]].

As of 2016 the low-layer loops (i.e. for flight control) tick as fast as 32,000 times per second, while higher-level loops may cycle once per second. The principle is to decompose the aircraft's behavior into manageable \"chunks\", or states, with known transitions. Hierarchical control system types range from simple [[scripting language|scripts]] to [[finite-state machine|finite state machines]], [[behavior tree]]s and [[hierarchical task network|hierarchical task planners]].

These two were followed in service by the similarly-named [[Airspeed Queen Wasp]] and [[Miles Martinet|Miles Queen Martinet]], before ultimate replacement by the [[GAF Jindivik]].<ref>Note; the term \"[[Drone (bee)|drone]]\" refers to the male bee that serves only to fertilize the [[queen bee]], hence the use of the name in reference to the DH Queen Bee aerial target.</ref>\n\nThe term ''unmanned aircraft system'' ('''UAS''') was adopted by the [[United States Department of Defense]] (DoD) and the United States [[Federal Aviation Administration]] in 2005 according to their Unmanned Aircraft System Roadmap 2005\u20132030.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.acq.osd.mil/usd/Roadmap%20Final2.pdf#search=%22Dod%20UAS%20Roadmap%202005%22|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002220516/http://www.acq.osd.mil/usd/Roadmap%20Final2.pdf#search=%22Dod%20UAS%20Roadmap%202005%22|url-status=dead|title=Unmanned Aircraft Systems Roadmap.|archivedate=2 October 2008}}</ref> The [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO) and the [[Civil Aviation Authority (United Kingdom)|British Civil Aviation Authority]] adopted this term, also used in the European Union's [[SESAR Joint Undertaking|Single-European-Sky (SES) Air-Traffic-Management (ATM) Research]] (SESAR Joint Undertaking) roadmap for 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|title = European ATM Master Plan 2015 {{!}} SESAR|url = http://www.sesarju.eu/newsroom/brochures-publications/european-atm-master-plan-2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160206104147/http://www.sesarju.eu/newsroom/brochures-publications/european-atm-master-plan-2015|url-status = dead|archive-date = 6 February 2016|website = www.sesarju.eu|access-date = 3 February 2016}}</ref> This term emphasizes the importance of elements other than the aircraft. It includes elements such as ground control stations, data links and other support equipment. A similar term is an ''unmanned-aircraft vehicle system'' (UAVS), ''remotely piloted aerial vehicle'' (RPAV), ''remotely piloted aircraft system'' (RPAS).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spatialsource.com.au/unmanned/state-government-gears-autonomous-rpas-mapping|title=State government gears up for autonomous RPAS mapping|date=23 January 2017}}</ref> Many similar terms are in use.\n\nA UAV is defined as a \"powered, aerial vehicle that does not carry a human operator, uses [[Aerodynamic force|aerodynamic forces]] to provide vehicle lift, can fly autonomously or be piloted remotely, can be expendable or recoverable, and can carry a lethal or nonlethal payload\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Unmanned+Aerial+Vehicle|title=unmanned aerial vehicle|work=TheFreeDictionary.com|accessdate=8 January 2015}}</ref> Therefore, [[missile]]s are not considered UAVs because the vehicle itself is a weapon that is not reused, though it is also uncrewed and in some cases remotely guided. That being said, UAV is a term that is commonly applied to military use cases.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Guilmartin |first1=John F. |title=unmanned aerial vehicle |url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/unmanned-aerial-vehicle |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |accessdate=24 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe terms autonomous drone and UAV are often wrongfully used interchangeably. This could stem from the fact that many UAVs are automated, i.e. they carry out automated missions but still rely on human operators. However, an autonomous drone is a \u201cUAV that can operate without any human intervention\u201d.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Avitan |first1=Ariel |title=The Differences Between UAV, UAS, and Autonomous Drones |url=https://percepto.co/what-are-the-differences-between-uav-uas-and-autonomous-drones/ |website=Percepto |accessdate=16 April 2020 |date=3 January 2019}}</ref> In other words, autonomous drones take off, carry out missions, and land completely autonomously. Thus, an autonomous drone is a type of UAV but a UAV is not necessarily an autonomous drone. \n\nAs autonomous drones are not piloted by humans, a ground control system, or communications management software, plays a major role in their operations, and thus they are also considered part of a UAS. In addition to the software, autonomous drones also employ a host of advanced technologies that allow them to carry out their missions without human intervention, such as cloud computing, computer vision, artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, and thermal sensors.<ref>{{cite web |title=Drones and Artificial Intelligence |url=https://www.droneii.com/drones-and-artificial-intelligence |website=Drone Industry Insights |accessdate=11 April 2020 |date=28 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years, autonomous drones have begun to transform various commercial industries as they can fly beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS)<ref>{{cite web |title=How Autonomous Drone Flights Will Go Beyond Line of Sight |url=https://www.nanalyze.com/2019/12/autonomous-drone-flights/ |website=Nanalyze |date=31 December 2019}}</ref> while maximizing production, reducing costs and risks, ensuring site safety, security and regulatory compliance<ref>{{cite web |last1=McNabb |first1=Miriam |title=Drones Get the Lights Back on Faster for Florida Communities |url=https://dronelife.com/2020/02/28/drones-get-the-lights-back-on-faster-for-florida-communities/ |website=DRONELIFE |date=28 February 2020}}</ref>, and protecting the human workforce in times of a pandemic.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Peck |first1=Abe |title=Coronavirus Spurs Percepto\u2019s Drone-in-a-Box Surveillance Solution |url=https://insideunmannedsystems.com/unintended-consequences-coronavirus-spurs-perceptos-drone-in-a-box-surveillance-solution/ |website=Inside Unmanned Systems |date=19 March 2020}}</ref> They can also be used for consumer-related missions like package delivery, as demonstrated by [[Amazon Prime Air]], and critical deliveries of health supplies.\n\nA [[Drone in a Box|Drone-in-a-Box]] (DIB) is an autonomous drone that deploys to carry out a pre-programmed list of missions from and returns to a self-contained landing box, which also functions as the drone\u2019s charging base.\n\nUnder new regulations which came into effect June 1, 2019, the term RPAS (Remotely Piloted Aircraft System) has been adopted by the Canadian Government to mean \"a set of configurable elements consisting of a remotely piloted aircraft, its control station, the command and control links and any other system elements required during flight operation\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lois-laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-96-433/FullText.html#s-900.01|title=Canadian Aviation Regulations|last=|first=|date=June 1, 2019|website=Government of Canada - Justice Laws Website|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=January 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe relation of UAVs to [[Radio-controlled aircraft|remote controlled model aircraft]] is unclear.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} UAVs may or may not include model aircraft. Some jurisdictions base their definition on size or weight; however, the US [[Federal Aviation Administration]] defines any uncrewed flying craft as a UAV regardless of size.

The main exceptions are the [[cockpit]] and [[Environmental control system (aircraft)|environmental control system]] or [[life support system]]s. Some UAVs carry payloads (such as a camera) that weigh considerably less than an adult human, and as a result can be considerably smaller. Though they carry heavy payloads, weaponized military UAVs are lighter than their crewed counterparts with comparable armaments.\n\nSmall civilian UAVs have no [[life-critical system]]s, and can thus be built out of lighter but less sturdy materials and shapes, and can use less robustly tested electronic control systems. For small UAVs, the [[quadcopter]] design has become popular, though this layout is rarely used for crewed aircraft. Miniaturization means that less-powerful propulsion technologies can be used that are not feasible for crewed aircraft, such as small electric motors and batteries.\n\nControl systems for UAVs are often different than crewed craft. For remote human control, a camera and video link almost always replace the cockpit windows; radio-transmitted digital commands replace physical cockpit controls. [[Autopilot]] software is used on both crewed and uncrewed aircraft, with varying feature sets.\n\n===Body===\nThe primary difference for planes is the absence of the cockpit area and its windows. Tailless quadcopters are a common form factor for rotary wing UAVs while tailed mono- and bi-copters are common for crewed platforms.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/amp/2016/10/02/hybrid-drone-flies-with-one-propeller/|title=Drone flies as both biplane and helicopter using one propeller|website=Engadget}}</ref>\n\n===Power supply and platform===\nSmall UAVs mostly use [[Lithium polymer battery|lithium-polymer batteries]] (Li-Po), while larger vehicles rely on conventional airplane engines. Scale or size of aircraft is not the defining or limiting characteristic of energy supply for a UAV. At present,{{when|date=August 2018}} the energy density of Li-Po is far less than gasoline. The record of travel for a UAV (built from balsa wood and mylar skin) across the North Atlantic Ocean is held by a gasoline model airplane or UAV. Manard Hill in \"in 2003 when one of his creations flew 1,882 miles across the Atlantic Ocean on less than a gallon of fuel\" holds this record. See:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/model-airplane-history-maker-maynard-hill-dies-at-the-age-of-85/2011/06/08/AGcnyQNH_story.html|title=Model airplane history-maker Maynard Hill dies at the age of 85|website=Washington Post}}</ref> Electric power is used as less work is required for a flight and electric motors are quieter. Also, properly designed, the thrust to weight ratio for an electric or gasoline motor driving a propeller can hover or climb vertically.

Early UAVs had only [[narrowband]] uplink. Downlinks came later. These bi-directional narrowband radio links carried command and control (C&C) and [[telemetry]] data about the status of aircraft systems to the remote operator. For very long range flights, military UAVs also use [[satellite]] receivers as part of [[satellite navigation]] systems. In cases when video transmission was required, the UAVs will implement a separate analog video radio link.\n\nIn the most modern UAV applications, video transmission is required. So instead of having 2 separate links for C&C, telemetry and video traffic, a [[broadband]] link is used to carry all types of data on a single radio link. These broadband links can leverage [[quality of service]] techniques to optimize the C&C traffic for low latency. Usually these broadband links carry [[TCP/IP]] traffic that can be routed over the Internet.\n\nThe radio signal from the operator side can be issued from either:\n\n* Ground control \u2013 a human operating a [[Transmitter|radio transmitter]]/receiver, a smartphone, a tablet, a computer, or the original meaning of a [[Ground control station|military ground control station (GCS)]].

As of 2016 the low-layer loops (i.e. for flight control) tick as fast as 32,000 times per second, while higher-level loops may cycle once per second. The principle is to decompose the aircraft's behavior into manageable \"chunks\", or states, with known transitions. Hierarchical control system types range from simple [[scripting language|scripts]] to [[finite-state machine|finite state machines]], [[behavior tree]]s and [[hierarchical task network|hierarchical task planners]]. The most common control mechanism used in these layers is the [[PID controller]] which can be used to achieve hover for a [[quadcopter]] by using data from the [[inertial measurement unit|IMU]] to calculate precise inputs for the electronic speed controllers and motors.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nExamples of mid-layer algorithms:\n\n* Path planning: determining an optimal path for vehicle to follow while meeting mission objectives and constraints, such as obstacles or fuel requirements\n* Trajectory generation ([[motion planning]]): determining control maneuvers to take in order to follow a given path or to go from one location to another<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Comparison of Parallel Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization for Real-Time UAV Path Planning|journal = IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics|date = 1 February 2013|issn = 1551-3203|pages = 132\u2013141|volume = 9|issue = 1|doi = 10.1109/TII.2012.2198665|first = V.|last = Roberge|first2 = M.|last2 = Tarbouchi|first3 = G.|last3 = Labonte}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title = Autonomous UAV path planning and estimation|journal = IEEE Robotics Automation Magazine|date = 1 June 2009|issn = 1070-9932|pages = 35\u201342|volume = 16|issue = 2|doi = 10.1109/MRA.2009.932529|first = J.|last = Tisdale|first2 = ZuWhan|last2 = Kim|first3 = J.K.|last3 = Hedrick}}</ref>\n* Trajectory regulation: constraining a vehicle within some tolerance to a trajectory\nEvolved UAV hierarchical task planners use methods like state [[Tree search algorithm|tree searches]] or [[genetic algorithm]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.iaeng.org/publication/WCE2014/WCE2014_pp551-557.pdf|title = UAV Path Planning with Parallel Genetic Algorithms on CUDA Architecture|date = 2014|access-date = |website = World congress on engineering|last = Cekmez, Ozsiginan, Aydin And Sahingoz}}</ref>\n\n=== Autonomy features ===\n[[File:Degrees of autonomy.jpg|thumb|UAV's degrees of autonomy]]\nUAV manufacturers often build in specific autonomous operations, such as:\n\n* Self-level: attitude stabilization on the pitch and roll axes.\n* Altitude hold: The aircraft maintains its altitude using barometric pressure and/or GPS data. \n* Hover/position hold: Keep level pitch and roll, stable yaw heading and altitude while maintaining position using [[GNSS]] or inertal sensors.\n* Headless mode: Pitch control relative to the position of the pilot rather than relative to the vehicle's axes. \n* Care-free: automatic roll and yaw control while moving horizontally\n* Take-off and landing (using a variety of aircraft or ground-based sensors and systems; see also:[[Autoland]])\n* Failsafe: automatic landing or return-to-home upon loss of control signal\n* Return-to-home: Fly back to the point of takeoff (often gaining altitude first to avoid possible intervening obstructions such as trees or buildings).\n* Follow-me: Maintain relative position to a moving pilot or other object using GNSS, [[image recognition]] or homing beacon.\n* GPS waypoint navigation: Using GNSS to navigate to an intermediate location on a travel path.\n* Orbit around an object: Similar to Follow-me but continuously circle a target.\n* Pre-programmed [[aerobatics]] (such as rolls and loops)\n\n== Functions ==\nFull autonomy is available for specific tasks, such as airborne refueling<ref>{{Cite news|title = Watch a step in Navy history: an autonomous drone gets refueled mid-air|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2015/04/23/watch-a-step-in-aviation-history-an-autonomous-drone-getting-refueled-mid-air/|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = 23 April 2015|access-date = 3 February 2016|issn = 0190-8286|first = Christian|last = Davenport}}</ref> or ground-based battery switching; but higher-level tasks call for greater computing, sensing and actuating capabilities.
