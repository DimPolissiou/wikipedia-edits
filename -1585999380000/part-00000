The 113th Battalion was authorized on 22 December 1915 as part of a recruiting drive in which men from the same region could enlist and serve together.<ref name=cefresearch>http://www.cefresearch.ca/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=39</ref>   [[File:Signal_Hill_WW1_Battalion_Signs.jpg|thumb|right|Signal Hill, Calgary, with painted stones placed by soldiers from Lethbridge (113) who trained in Calgary in early 1916 before embarking for Europe in September 1916]] The battalion trained on the [[Lethbridge]] exhibition grounds in 1915. [[File:113th_Bn_Lethbridge_AB_1915.jpg|thumb|left|113th Battalion portrait, Lethbridge exhibition grounds, Lethbridge AB]]  The rank-and-file soldiers were not issued Highland kit, but the battalion did raise three pipes and drums bands who were. Basic training in the CEF involved rifle training, bombing or hand grenade practice, route marches, rifle drill and many inspections. Inspections were very popular for the 113th as many wished to hear their three bands.<ref name=cefresearch/>\n\nIn late May 1916, the battalion moved to Sarcee Camp outside Calgary for further training that lasted until September. During the time spent at Sarcee the battalion used painted rocks to construct their battalion number on nearby Signal Hill in Calgary. This bold white stone is still visible and preserved in [[Battalion Park]].\nIn early September 1916 orders came for the battalion to entrain for the east and by September 19 the battalion was on its way.\n\n[[File:Walter_James_113th_Leth_Highlanders.jpg|thumb|left|Walter James of [[Gleichen, Alberta]], in his uniform; he served with the 113th Battalion (Lethbridge Highlanders.) James survived the war.<ref>http://gleichen.ca/history/military-service/</ref>]]On September 26, 1916, the 113th embarked along with the 111th and 145th Battalions on {{ship|SS|Tuscania|1914|6}}, a transport ship. The trip across the Atlantic took ten days and upon arriving in England the battalion was taken to a holding camp at Sandling near Shorncliffe. It was at Sandling that Lieutenant-Colonel Pryce-Jones, the commanding officer, learned that the 113th would be broken up for replacements and would not see action as a unit after all. One can only imagine the disappointment of these men as they learned the fate of the 113th, their battalion, after 10 months training together.\n\nThe 113th was transferred to the [[17th Reserve Battalion, CEF]], the Nova Scotia Highlanders, affiliated with the Scottish [[Seaforth Highlanders]]. The 17th was at Bramshott Camp located South of London. On October 12, 1916, most of the old 113th proceeded to France arriving at a camp near Le Havre France. Almost immediately 300 men of the old 113th were assigned as replacements to one of the most famous battalions in the CEF, the [[16th Battalion (Canadian Scottish), CEF|16th Battalion (Canadian Scottish)]]. An idea of the casualties suffered by the 16th in the Somme fighting of the fall of 1916 can be understood by this reinforcement. This would mean that roughly 30% of the 16th were new transfers from the 113th.<ref name=\"cefresearch\"/>\n\nThe battalion disbanded on 1 September 1917.<ref name=\"DHH\">{{cite web|title=The South Alberta Light Horse|url=http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/his/ol-lo/vol-tom-3/par1/arm-bli/SALH-eng.asp|website=Official Lineages Volume 3, Part 1: Armour, Artillery and Field Engineer Regiments \u2013 Armour Regiments|publisher=Directorate of History and Heritage|accessdate=8 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe battalion recruited in, and was mobilized at, Lethbridge, Alberta.<ref name=\"meek\">Meek, John F.

The 113th Battalion was authorized on 22 December 1915 as part of a recruiting drive in which men from the same region could enlist and serve together.<ref name=cefresearch>http://www.cefresearch.ca/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=39</ref>   [[File:Signal_Hill_WW1_Battalion_Signs.jpg|thumb|right|Signal Hill, Calgary, with painted stones placed by soldiers from Lethbridge (113) who trained in Calgary in early 1916 before embarking for Europe in September 1916]] The battalion trained on the [[Lethbridge]] exhibition grounds in 1915. [[File:113th_Bn_Lethbridge_AB_1915.jpg|thumb|left|113th Battalion portrait, Lethbridge exhibition grounds, Lethbridge AB]]  The rank-and-file soldiers were not issued Highland kit, but the battalion did raise three pipes and drums bands who were. Basic training in the CEF involved rifle training, bombing or hand grenade practice, route marches, rifle drill and many inspections. Inspections were very popular for the 113th as many wished to hear their three bands.<ref name=cefresearch/>\n\nIn late May 1916, the battalion moved to Sarcee Camp outside Calgary for further training that lasted until September. During the time spent at Sarcee the battalion used painted rocks to construct their battalion number on nearby Signal Hill in Calgary. This bold white stone is still visible and preserved in [[Battalion Park]].\nIn early September 1916 orders came for the battalion to entrain for the east and by September 19 the battalion was on its way.\n\n[[File:Walter_James_113th_Leth_Highlanders.jpg|thumb|left|Walter James of [[Gleichen, Alberta]], in his uniform; he served with the 113th Battalion (Lethbridge Highlanders.) James survived the war.<ref>http://gleichen.ca/history/military-service/</ref>]]On September 26, 1916, the 113th embarked along with the 111th and 145th Battalions on {{ship|SS|Tuscania|1914|6}}, a transport ship. The trip across the Atlantic took ten days and upon arriving in England the battalion was taken to a holding camp at Sandling near Shorncliffe. It was at Sandling that Lieutenant-Colonel Pryce-Jones, the commanding officer, learned that the 113th would be broken up for replacements and would not see action as a unit after all. One can only imagine the disappointment of these men as they learned the fate of the 113th, their battalion, after 10 months training together.\n\nThe 113th was transferred to the [[17th Reserve Battalion, CEF]], the Nova Scotia Highlanders, affiliated with the Scottish [[Seaforth Highlanders]]. The 17th was at Bramshott Camp located South of London. On October 12, 1916, most of the old 113th proceeded to France arriving at a camp near Le Havre France. Almost immediately 300 men of the old 113th were assigned as replacements to one of the most famous battalions in the CEF, the [[16th Battalion (Canadian Scottish), CEF|16th Battalion (Canadian Scottish)]]. An idea of the casualties suffered by the 16th in the Somme fighting of the fall of 1916 can be understood by this reinforcement. This would mean that roughly 30% of the 16th were new transfers from the 113th.<ref name=\"cefresearch\"/>\n\nThe battalion disbanded on 1 September 1917.<ref name=\"DHH\">{{cite web|title=The South Alberta Light Horse|url=http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/his/ol-lo/vol-tom-3/par1/arm-bli/SALH-eng.asp|website=Official Lineages Volume 3, Part 1: Armour, Artillery and Field Engineer Regiments \u2013 Armour Regiments|publisher=Directorate of History and Heritage|accessdate=8 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe battalion recruited in, and was mobilized at, Lethbridge, Alberta.<ref name=\"meek\">Meek, John F.

He started off as a writer on the series ''[[Hill Street Blues]]'' before co-creating ''[[NYPD Blue]]'' with [[Steven Bochco]] and creating the [[HBO]] series ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]''.\nMilch had been fascinated by horse racing from an early age as his father would take him to the track. \"My dad started taking me to Saratoga at age 5 or 6. You have so many associations from childhood that stay with you.\"<ref name=\"Pugmire\" /> He stated that he had been thinking about creating the series for 25 years and always pictured that it would be set at [[Santa Anita Park]]. \"It's the most beautiful setting for horse racing that I've seen, and I'd include Saratoga,\" he said.<ref name=\"Pugmire\" />\n\nThe character of on-the-skids jockey Ronnie is portrayed by racing fixture [[Gary Stevens (jockey)|Gary Stevens]], a [[National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] jockey who has won the [[Kentucky Derby]], the [[Preakness Stakes]] and the [[Belmont Stakes]] in the course of his career. Stevens portrayed jockey [[George Woolf]] in the 2003 film ''[[Seabiscuit (film)|Seabiscuit]].''\n\nThe series used 50 horses, trained by Matt Chew at Santa Anita. As he described, \"Because it's a natural tendency for horses to want to be a part of a herd, most adapt to it very well. We have a couple individuals that have been taught to be race horses; we're not going to get that out of their system. We'll just have to adapt to it.

In vitro studies have shown that nitazoxanide inhibits thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT), all folate-dependent enzymes involved in the de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and purine nucleotides. Nitazoxanide is transported into cells by both the reduced folate carrier and membrane folate binding protein transport systems. Once in the cell, nitazoxanide is converted to polyglutamate forms by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase. The polyglutamate forms are retained in cells and are inhibitors of TS and GARFT. Polyglutamation is a time- and concentration-dependent process that occurs in tumor cells and, to a lesser extent, in normal tissues. Polyglutamated metabolites have an increased intracellular half-life resulting in prolonged drug action in malignant cells.\n\n<ref name=\"DrugBank Nitazoxanide\">{{cite web|title=Nitazoxanide|url=http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00507|website=DrugBank|publisher=University of Alberta|accessdate=3 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n{{cite journal | pmid =  26258002 | doi=10.1007/s40475-015-0051-1 | pmc=4523694 | volume=2 | title=Drug Resistance in the Microaerophilic Parasite Giardia lamblia | year=2015 | journal=Curr Trop Med Rep | pages=128\u2013135  | last1 = Leitsch | first1 = D}} is a review that covers its antiprotazoal pharmacodynamics\n-->\n\n===Pharmacokinetics===\nFollowing oral administration, nitazoxanide is rapidly [[hydrolyzed]] to the pharmacologically active metabolite, [[tizoxanide]], which is 99% protein bound.<ref name=\"FDA Nitazoxanide\" /><ref name=\"pmid17888524\">{{cite journal |author=Korba BE |title=Nitazoxanide, tizoxanide and other thiazolides are potent inhibitors of hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus replication |journal=Antiviral Res. |volume=77 |issue=1 |pages=56\u201363 |date=January 2008 |pmid=17888524 |doi=10.1016/j.antiviral.2007.08.005 |name-list-format=vanc|author2=Montero AB |author3=Farrar K |display-authors=3 |last4=Gaye |first4=Karen |last5=Mukerjee |first5=Sampa |last6=Ayers |first6=Marc S. |last7=Rossignol |first7=Jean-Fran\u00e7ois}}</ref> Tizoxanide is then [[glucuronide conjugation|glucuronide conjugated]] into the active metabolite, [[tizoxanide glucuronide]].<ref name=\"FDA Nitazoxanide\" />  Peak plasma concentrations of the metabolites tizoxanide and tizoxanide glucuronide are observed 1\u20134&nbsp;hours after oral administration of nitazoxanide, whereas nitazoxanide itself is not detected in [[blood plasma]].<ref name=\"FDA Nitazoxanide\" />\n\nRoughly {{frac|2|3}} of an oral dose of nitazoxanide is excreted as its metabolites in feces, while the remainder of the dose excreted in urine.<ref name=\"FDA Nitazoxanide\" /> Tizoxanide is excreted in the [[urine]], [[bile]] and [[feces]].<ref name=\"FDA Nitazoxanide\" /> Tizoxanide glucuronide is excreted in urine and bile.<ref name=\"FDA Nitazoxanide\" />\n\n== Chemistry ==\n{{expand section|date=January 2016}}\nNitazoxanide is the prototype member of the [[thiazolide]]s, which is a [[drug class]] of structurally-related broad-spectrum [[antiparasitic]] compounds.<ref name=\"Thiazolides\" /> Nitazoxanide is a light yellow crystalline powder.

Initial studies demonstrated activity versus [[tapeworms]]. ''In vitro'' studies demonstrated much broader activity. Dr. Rossignol co-founded Romark Laboratories, with the goal of bringing nitazoxanide to market as an anti-parasitic drug. Initial studies in the USA were conducted in collaboration with Unimed Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ([[Marietta, GA]]) and focused on development of the drug for treatment of [[cryptosporidiosis]] in [[AIDS]]. Controlled trials began shortly after the advent of effective anti-retroviral therapies. The trials were abandoned due to poor enrollment and the FDA rejected an application based on uncontrolled studies.\n\nSubsequently, Romark launched a series of controlled trials. A placebo-controlled study of nitazoxanide in cryptosporidiosis demonstrated significant clinical improvement in adults and children with mild illness. Among malnourished children in Zambia with chronic cryptosporidiosis, a three-day course of therapy led to clinical and parasitologic improvement and improved survival. In Zambia and in a study conducted in Mexico, nitazoxanide was not successful in the treatment of cryptosporidiosis in advanced infection with human immunodeficiency virus at the doses used. However, it was effective in patients with higher CD4 counts. In treatment of giardiasis, nitazoxanide was superior to placebo and comparable to [[metronidazole]]. Nitazoxanide was successful in the treatment of metronidazole-resistant giardiasis. Studies have suggested efficacy in the treatment of [[cyclosporiasis]], [[isosporiasis]], and [[amebiasis]].<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Am. J. Trop. Med.

In vitro studies have shown that nitazoxanide inhibits thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT), all folate-dependent enzymes involved in the de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and purine nucleotides. Nitazoxanide is transported into cells by both the reduced folate carrier and membrane folate binding protein transport systems. Once in the cell, nitazoxanide is converted to polyglutamate forms by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase. The polyglutamate forms are retained in cells and are inhibitors of TS and GARFT. Polyglutamation is a time- and concentration-dependent process that occurs in tumor cells and, to a lesser extent, in normal tissues. Polyglutamated metabolites have an increased intracellular half-life resulting in prolonged drug action in malignant cells.\n\n<ref name=\"DrugBank Nitazoxanide\">{{cite web|title=Nitazoxanide|url=http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00507|website=DrugBank|publisher=University of Alberta|accessdate=3 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nPMID 26258002 is a review that covers its antiprotazoal pharmacodynamics\n-->\n\n===Pharmacokinetics===\nFollowing oral administration, nitazoxanide is rapidly [[hydrolyzed]] to the pharmacologically active metabolite, [[tizoxanide]], which is 99% protein bound.<ref name=\"FDA Nitazoxanide\" /><ref name=\"pmid17888524\">{{cite journal |author=Korba BE |title=Nitazoxanide, tizoxanide and other thiazolides are potent inhibitors of hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus replication |journal=Antiviral Res. |volume=77 |issue=1 |pages=56\u201363 |date=January 2008 |pmid=17888524 |doi=10.1016/j.antiviral.2007.08.005 |name-list-format=vanc|author2=Montero AB |author3=Farrar K |display-authors=3 |last4=Gaye |first4=Karen |last5=Mukerjee |first5=Sampa |last6=Ayers |first6=Marc S. |last7=Rossignol |first7=Jean-Fran\u00e7ois}}</ref> Tizoxanide is then [[glucuronide conjugation|glucuronide conjugated]] into the active metabolite, [[tizoxanide glucuronide]].<ref name=\"FDA Nitazoxanide\" />  Peak plasma concentrations of the metabolites tizoxanide and tizoxanide glucuronide are observed 1\u20134&nbsp;hours after oral administration of nitazoxanide, whereas nitazoxanide itself is not detected in [[blood plasma]].<ref name=\"FDA Nitazoxanide\" />\n\nRoughly {{frac|2|3}} of an oral dose of nitazoxanide is excreted as its metabolites in feces, while the remainder of the dose excreted in urine.<ref name=\"FDA Nitazoxanide\" /> Tizoxanide is excreted in the [[urine]], [[bile]] and [[feces]].<ref name=\"FDA Nitazoxanide\" /> Tizoxanide glucuronide is excreted in urine and bile.<ref name=\"FDA Nitazoxanide\" />\n\n== Chemistry ==\n{{expand section|date=January 2016}}\nNitazoxanide is the prototype member of the [[thiazolide]]s, which is a [[drug class]] of structurally-related broad-spectrum [[antiparasitic]] compounds.<ref name=\"Thiazolides\" /> Nitazoxanide is a light yellow crystalline powder. It is poorly soluble in ethanol and practically insoluble in water.\n\n== History ==\nNitazoxanide was originally discovered in the 1980s by [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Rossignol]] at the [[Pasteur Institute]]. Initial studies demonstrated activity versus [[tapeworms]]. ''In vitro'' studies demonstrated much broader activity. Dr. Rossignol co-founded Romark Laboratories, with the goal of bringing nitazoxanide to market as an anti-parasitic drug. Initial studies in the USA were conducted in collaboration with Unimed Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ([[Marietta, GA]]) and focused on development of the drug for treatment of [[cryptosporidiosis]] in [[AIDS]]. Controlled trials began shortly after the advent of effective anti-retroviral therapies. The trials were abandoned due to poor enrollment and the FDA rejected an application based on uncontrolled studies.\n\nSubsequently, Romark launched a series of controlled trials. A placebo-controlled study of nitazoxanide in cryptosporidiosis demonstrated significant clinical improvement in adults and children with mild illness. Among malnourished children in Zambia with chronic cryptosporidiosis, a three-day course of therapy led to clinical and parasitologic improvement and improved survival. In Zambia and in a study conducted in Mexico, nitazoxanide was not successful in the treatment of cryptosporidiosis in advanced infection with human immunodeficiency virus at the doses used. However, it was effective in patients with higher CD4 counts. In treatment of giardiasis, nitazoxanide was superior to placebo and comparable to [[metronidazole]]. Nitazoxanide was successful in the treatment of metronidazole-resistant giardiasis. Studies have suggested efficacy in the treatment of [[cyclosporiasis]], [[isosporiasis]], and [[amebiasis]].<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Am. J. Trop. Med.

It was written and produced by [[Stock Aitken Waterman]]. The song was released as the first single from Astley's debut album, ''[[Whenever You Need Somebody]]'' (1987). The song was a worldwide number-one hit, initially in the singer's native United Kingdom in 1987, where it stayed [[List of UK Singles Chart number ones|at the top of the chart]] for five weeks and was the best-selling single of that year. It eventually topped the charts in 25 countries, including the United States and West Germany.<ref name=\"MikeStock\">{{cite web|title= Biography |publisher= Mike Stock Music |accessdate= 14 November 2011 |url= http://www.mikestockmusic.com/index.php?page=Biography02&section=sectionBiography |archivedate= 3 October 2011 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111003132814/http://www.mikestockmusic.com/index.php?page=Biography02&section=sectionBiography |url-status= dead}}</ref>\n\nThe song won Best British Single at the 1988 [[Brit Awards]].

In the case of the [[Cook Islands]] and [[Niue]], the details of their free association arrangement are contained in several documents, such as their respective constitutions, the 1983 Exchange of Letters between the governments of [[New Zealand]] and the Cook Islands, and the 2001 Joint Centenary Declaration. Free associated states can be described as independent or not, but free association is not a qualification of an entity's statehood or status as a subject of international law.\n\nInformally it can be considered more widely: from a post-colonial form of [[protectorate|amical protection]], or [[protectorate]], to [[asymmetrical federalism|confederation of unequal members]] when the lesser partner(s) delegate(s) to the major one (often the former colonial power) some authority normally exclusively retained by a sovereign state, usually in such fields as defense and foreign relations, while often enjoying favorable economic terms such as market access.\n\nAccording to some scholars, a form of association based on benign protection and delegation of sovereignty can be seen as a defining feature of [[microstates]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|url = http://ams.hi.is/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Microstates_OccasionalPaper.pdf|title = Microstates as Modern Protected States: Towards a New Definition of Micro-Statehood|last = Dumie\u0144ski|first = Zbigniew|date = 2014|journal = |accessdate = 20 August 2014|doi = |pmid = |publisher = Centre for Small State Studies|series = Occasional Paper}}</ref>\n\nA [[federacy]], a type of government where at least one of the subunits in an otherwise unitary state enjoys autonomy like a subunit within a federation, is similar to an associated state, with such subunit(s) having considerable independence in internal issues, except foreign affairs and defense.

Soon after the conclusion of the war, the French colonial territories of [[Vietnam]], [[Cambodia]], and [[Laos]] were designated as 'associated states' within the newly-created [[French Union]]. The arrangement afforded these countries a limited degree of internal and external sovereignty (for example, they were allowed to enter into diplomatic relations with a small number of countries), but for the most part reserved for France effective control over foreign relations, as well as military, judicial, administrative, and economic activities.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite book|last=Igarashi |first=Masahiro |date=2002 |title=Associated Statehood in International Law |url=https://books.google.com/?id=1peIxEyy1o0C&dq=associated+statehood+in+international+law|location=The Hague, Netherlands |publisher=Kluwer Law International |page=24 |isbn=90-411-1710-5 |author-link=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://indochine.uqam.ca/en/historical-dictionary/77-associated-states-of-indochina.html|title=UQAM &#124; Guerre d'Indochine &#124; ASSOCIATED STATES OF INDOCHINA|website=indochine.uqam.ca}}</ref> According to some French jurists, the concept of associated state under the 1946 French constitution automatically extended to the territories of [[Morocco]] and [[Tunisia]], which up until then had been protectorates of France.

Soon after the conclusion of the war, the French colonial territories of [[Vietnam]], [[Cambodia]], and [[Laos]] were designated as 'associated states' within the newly-created [[French Union]].

According to the definition of microstates proposed by Dumienski (2014): \"Microstates are modern protected states, i.e. sovereign states that have been able to unilaterally depute certain attributes of sovereignty to larger powers in exchange for benign protection of their political and economic viability against their geographic or demographic constraints.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Adopting this approach permits separating microstates from both small states and autonomies or dependencies. Microstates understood as modern protected states include such states as [[Liechtenstein]], [[San Marino]], [[Monaco]], [[Vatican City]], [[Andorra]], [[Niue]], [[the Cook Islands]], or [[Palau]].\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Commonwealth realm]]\n* [[Crown dependency]]\n*[[Dominion]]\n* [[External association]], 1921 proposed relationship between Ireland and the United Kingdom\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Autonomous types of first-tier administration}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Associated State}}\n[[Category:States by power status]]\n[[Category:Constitutional state types]]\n[[Category:Associated states| ]]\n[[Category:Political systems]]\n", "name_user": "Antadam127", "label": "safe", "comment": "Defence > Defense", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_state"}
