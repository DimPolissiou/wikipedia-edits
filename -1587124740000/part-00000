He was founder of the [[Burger Landmarks]] website and had retired as computer programmer in the 1990s to become a geographic researcher on the hydrology of waterfalls. He used [[VR panorama]]s as a tool in the research of [[landscape]]s. He was greatly influenced by geographer [[Don Bain]] for [[document]]ing the landscape with VR panoramas and [[Hans Nyberg]] for his use of [[QuickTime]] VR fullscreen panoramas.\n\nHis first [[360 degrees|360\u00b0]] pictures \u2013 so called: [[Cyclorama]]s, were taken with [[Black-and-white|BW]] [[negative film]] in 1982.\n\n*In 1989 he has created a [[computer program]] with an [[algorithm]] for assembling different types of crosswords, [[Word square]]s from 6x6 to 10x10 and no blank filled crosswords \u2013 [[Word rectangle]]s 6x6. His crosswords were published in renovated Slovenian [[enigmatic magazine]]s ([[Kih]], [[Ugankarski domenek]], \u2026) in a period from 1989 to 1992.\n*[[Virtual museum]] [[Ljubljana]]: [[Open-Air Museum]] \u2014 founded by Bo\u0161tjan Burger in 1993 and online 1996. Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia was presented as a huge museum where streets were the expositions of the [[architecture]] and building interiors were museum rooms. The method of the presentation were interactive maps and interactive historical relations between locations of Ljubljana documented with photos and later with Virtual Reality panoramas. In 1999 Ljubljana municipality co-founded a one-year development of the Burger's Virtual museum Ljubljana.\n*In June 1996 Bo\u0161tjan Burger became involved in the creation of 'Slovenia Land of [[Waterfall]]s', which was launched on the [[Internet]] after 15 years of researching the [[hydrology]] of the waterfalls of Slovenia. Over 300 separate waterfalls were recorded with complete data and visual information on each waterfall - the majority of which were presented and documented in VR. And so the project went on to create other VR intensive initiatives.\n*In 1997 the [[Virtual Reality Panorama]] project: Landmarks was started to create a striking visual presentation using Virtual Reality Panoramas. The Virtual Tour was very effective in showcasing locations like caves, deep gorges and mountain peaks, as well as towns, museums, castles, and national parks and ethnology. More than 11,000 VR Panoramas have been created for the project so far.\n*The CD-ROM 'Waterfalls of [[Triglav National Park]]' was published 1998, and covered the entire area of the National Park with permanent waterfalls. The multimedia guide consisted of descriptions of waterfalls, accesses, GPS location, maps, interactive photos, QTVR's and 61 min. of VHS quality movies of waterfalls on a single CD. Many of the CD's were donated to Slovenian schools and incorporated into the Geography curriculum.\n*In 1998&ndash;1999 the first [[virtual tour]] like [[street view]] with [[virtual reality panorama]]s with 400  virtual reality panoramas as part of Virtual museum Ljubljana was realised in [[Ljubljana]] (Slovenia).\n*The 'Virtual guide to Slovenian Museums' began in March 2000, and the funding has continued into 2004. Many Slovenian cultural locations are represented, which are in turn connected to a virtual guide of each museum. Currently 106 museum exhibitions are presented within this project.\n*Year 2000: The project of the [[Kr\u0161ko]] [[Nuclear power plant]] [[steam generator (nuclear power)|steam generator]]s replacement took place and Burger has realized the documentation and visualization of the interior of the Nuclear power plant including a [[cooling water pool]]s system which removes heat from the [[reactor core]]. The visualization was used as a learning tool to display processes in the nuclear plant.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120402160726/http://ocs-v3.ibe.si/portal/page?_pageid=54%2C128888&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL]</ref>\n*In September 2000, the newly initiated '[[Karst]] Project' began to organize and photograph the [[cave system]]s of [[Postojna Cave]] and \u0160kocjan Caves (Slovenia), so that people worldwide could admire this beauty without intruding in droves on the delicate [[ecosystem]].\n[[File:Burger KriznaJama 02.jpg|thumb|250px|Burger's subterranean photography of [[Cross Cave]], 2000]]\n[[File:Burger SJ Ponvice 01.jpg|thumb|250px|Burger's subterranean photography of [[\u0160kocjan Caves]], 2000]]\n[[File:Burger PostojnskaJama.jpg|thumb|250px|Burger's subterranean photography of [[Postojna Cave]], 2000]]\n*[[European schoolnet]]: 'Use of Internet and new technologies in schools'; from 4\u201311 May 2001 in [[Stockholm]].

The average width of the sea up to 20 m depth is nearly 16&nbsp;km wide and the length of the sea [[Levee|dikes]] is nearly 200&nbsp;km. The area of the coastal reservoir would be nearly 2900&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.

The main purpose of the twin dikes is to prevent any sea water seepage into coastal reservoir as its water level is below the sea water level. The water level between the dikes is always maintained up to 1 m above the sea level by pumping fresh water from the coastal reservoir to the 1000 m gap between the dikes. The higher level water barrier between the two dikes fully eliminate any sea water seepage in to the coastal reservoir by establishing fresh water seepage to the sea. The rain water falling on the coastal reservoir area and run off water from its catchment area is adequate to cater the seepage and evaporation losses from the coastal reservoir.

The average width of the sea up to 20 m depth is nearly 16&nbsp;km wide and the length of the sea [[Levee|dikes]] is nearly 200&nbsp;km. The area of the coastal reservoir would be nearly 2900&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.

The main purpose of the twin dikes is to prevent any sea water seepage into coastal reservoir as its water level is below the sea water level. The water level between the dikes is always maintained up to 1 m above the sea level by pumping fresh water from the coastal reservoir to the 1000 m gap between the dikes. The higher level water barrier between the two dikes fully eliminate any sea water seepage in to the coastal reservoir by establishing fresh water seepage to the sea. The rain water falling on the coastal reservoir area and run off water from its catchment area is adequate to cater the seepage and evaporation losses from the coastal reservoir.

Both Indo-European words for year, ''*yeh\u2081-ro-'' and ''*h\u2082et-no-'', would then be derived from verbal roots meaning \"to go, move\", ''*h\u2081ey-'' and ''*h\u2082et-'', respectively  (compare [[Vedic Sanskrit]] ''\u00e9ti'' \"goes\", ''atasi'' \"thou goest, wanderest\").\nA number of English words are derived from Latin ''annus'', such as [[wikt:annual|annual]], [[:wikt:annuity|annuity]], [[:wikt:anniversary|anniversary]], etc.; ''[[:wikt:per annum|per annum]]'' means \"each year\", ''[[anno Domini]]'' means \"in the year of the Lord\".\n\nThe Greek word for \"year\", {{lang|grc|\u1f14\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2}}, is cognate with Latin ''vetus'' \"old\", from the PIE word ''*wetos-'' \"year\", also preserved in this meaning in [[Sanskrit]]  ''{{IAST|vat-sa-ras}}'' \"year\" and ''{{IAST|vat-sa-}}'' \"yearling (calf)\", the latter also reflected in Latin ''[[:wikt:vitulus|vitulus]]'' \"bull calf\",  English ''wether'' \"ram\" (Old English ''we\u00f0er'', Gothic ''wi\u00ferus'' \"lamb\").\n\nIn some languages, it is common to count years by referencing to one season, as in \"summers\", or \"winters\", or \"harvests\". Examples include Chinese [[:wikt:\u5e74|\u5e74]] \"year\", originally [[:wikt:\u79c2|\u79c2]], an ideographic compound of a person carrying a bundle of wheat denoting \"harvest\".

Any calendar that follows an astronomical year must have a system of [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalation]] such as leap years.\n\n=== Julian calendar ===\nIn the Julian calendar, the average (mean) length of a year is 365.25 days. In a non-leap year, there are 365 days, in a leap year there are 366 days.

It is estimated that by the year 4000 CE, the northward equinox will fall back by one day in the Gregorian calendar, not because of this difference, but due to the slowing of the Earth's rotation and the associated lengthening of the day.\n\n===Other calendars===\n{{see|Lunisolar calendar}}\nHistorically, lunisolar calendars intercalated entire [[leap month]]s on an observational basis.\nLunisolar calendars have mostly fallen out of use except for liturgical reasons ([[Hebrew calendar]], various [[Hindu calendar]]s).\n\nA modern adaptation of the historical [[Jalali calendar]], known as the [[Solar Hijri calendar]] (1925), is a purely [[solar calendar]] with an irregular pattern of leap days based on observation (or astronomical computation), aiming to place new year ([[Nowruz]]) on the day of [[vernal equinox]] (for the time zone of [[Tehran]]), as opposed to using an algorithmic system of leap years.\n\n==Year numbering==\nA [[calendar era]] assigns a [[cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal number]] to each sequential  year, using a reference point in the past as the beginning of the era.\n\nThe worldwide standard is the [[Anno Domini]], although some prefer the term [[Common Era]] because it has no explicit reference to [[Christianity]]. It was introduced in the 6th century and was intended to count years from the [[nativity of Jesus]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Richards |first=E.G. |date=2013 |contribution=Calendars |editor1-first=S.E. |editor1-last=Urban |editor2-first=P.K. |editor2-last=Seidelmann |url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/publications/docs/c15_usb_online.pdf |title=Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac |edition=3rd |pages=585, 590 |location=Mill Valley, CA |publisher=University Science Books |isbn=978-1-891389-85-6}} Richards does not explicitly say that Anno Domini is the worldwide standard, but does say on page 585 that the Gregorian calendar is used throughout the world for secular purposes.</ref>\n\nThe Anno Domini era is given the Latin abbreviation AD (for [[Anno Domini]] \"in the year of the Lord\"), or alternatively CE for \"[[Common Era]]\". Years before AD 1 are abbreviated BC for [[Before Christ]] or alternatively BCE for [[Before the Common Era]].\nYear numbers are based on [[inclusive counting]], so that there is no \"year zero\".\nIn the modern alternative reckoning of [[Astronomical year numbering]], positive numbers indicate years AD, the number [[0 (year)|0]] designates [[1 BC]], \u22121 designates [[2 BC]], and so on.\n\n==Pragmatic divisions==\nFinancial and scientific calculations often use a [[365-day calendar]] to simplify daily rates.\n\n=== Fiscal year ===\nA [[fiscal year]] or financial year is a 12-month period used for calculating annual financial statements in businesses and other organizations. In many jurisdictions, regulations regarding accounting require such reports once per twelve months, but do not require that the twelve months constitute a calendar year.\n\nFor example, in [[Canada]] and [[India]] the fiscal year runs from April 1; in the [[United Kingdom]] it runs from April 1 for purposes of corporation tax and government financial statements, but from April 6 for purposes of personal taxation and payment of state benefits;  in [[Australia]] it runs from July 1; while in the [[United States]] the fiscal year of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] runs from October 1.\n\n=== Academic year ===\nAn academic year is the annual period during which a student attends an [[educational institution]]. The academic year may be divided into [[academic term]]s, such as semesters or quarters. The school year in many countries starts in August or September and ends in May, June or July.  In Israel the academic year begins around October or November, aligned with the second month of the [[Hebrew Calendar]].\n\nSome schools in the UK and USA divide the academic year into ''three'' roughly equal-length terms (called ''trimesters'' or ''quarters'' in the USA), roughly coinciding with autumn, winter, and spring. At some, a shortened summer session, sometimes considered part of the regular academic year, is attended by students on a voluntary or elective basis.  Other schools break the year into ''two'' main semesters, a first (typically August through December) and a second semester (January through May). Each of these main semesters may be split in half by mid-term exams, and each of the halves is referred to as a ''quarter'' (or ''term'' in some countries). There may also be a voluntary summer session and/or a short January session.\n\nSome other schools, including some in the United States, have ''four'' marking periods.  Some schools in the United States, notably [[Boston Latin School]], may divide the year into ''five or more'' marking periods. Some state in defense of this that there is perhaps a [[positive correlation]] between report frequency and academic achievement.\n\nThere are typically 180 days of teaching each year in schools in the US, excluding weekends and breaks, while there are 190 days for pupils in state schools in Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, and 200 for pupils in Australia.\n\nIn India the academic year normally starts from June 1 and ends on May 31. Though schools start closing from mid-March, the actual academic closure is on May 31 and in Nepal it starts from July 15.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nSchools and universities in Australia typically have academic years that roughly align with the calendar year (i.e., starting in February or March and ending in October to December), as the southern hemisphere experiences summer from December to February.\n\n== Astronomical years == <!-- This section is linked from [[Season]] -->\n{{see also|Astronomical month}}\n\n=== Julian year ===\n{{Main|Julian year (astronomy)}}\nThe Julian year, as used in astronomy and other sciences, is a time unit defined as exactly 365.25 days. This is the normal meaning of the unit \"year\" (symbol \"a\" from the [[Latin]] ''annus'') used in various scientific contexts. The Julian century of {{val|36525}} days and the Julian millennium of {{val|365250}} days are used in astronomical calculations. Fundamentally, expressing a time interval in Julian years is a way to precisely specify how many days (not how many \"real\" years), for long time intervals where stating the number of days would be unwieldy and unintuitive. By convention, the Julian year is used in the computation of the distance covered by a [[light-year]].\n\nIn the [[Unified Code for Units of Measure]], the symbol, ''a'' (without subscript), always refers to the Julian year, ''a<sub>j</sub>'', of exactly {{val|31557600}} [[second]]s.\n\n:365.25 days of {{val|86400}} seconds = 1 a = 1 a<sub>j</sub> = {{val|31.5576}} [[Second#SI multiples|Ms]]\n\nThe [[#SI prefix multipliers|SI multiplier prefixes]] may be applied to it to form ''ka'' (kiloannus), ''Ma'' (megaannus), etc.\n\n=== Sidereal, tropical, and anomalistic years ===\n{{hatnote|The relations among these are considered more fully in [[Axial precession (astronomy)]].}}\n\nEach of these three years can be loosely called an ''astronomical year''.\n\nThe [[sidereal year]] is the time taken for the Earth to complete one revolution of its [[orbit]], as measured against a fixed frame of reference (such as the fixed stars, Latin ''sidera'', singular ''sidus'').  Its average duration is {{val|365.256363004}} days (365 d 6 h 9 min 9.76 s) (at the epoch [[J2000.0]] = January 1, 2000, 12:00:00 [[Terrestrial Time|TT]]).<ref>International Earth Rotation and Reference System Service.

The modern definition of mean tropical year differs from the actual time between passages of, e.g., the northward equinox for several reasons explained below. Because of the Earth's [[axial precession (astronomy)|axial precession]], this year is about 20 minutes shorter than the sidereal year.  The mean tropical year is approximately 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 45 seconds, using the modern definition.<ref>\n{{cite book\n |url=http://asa.usno.navy.mil/SecM/Glossary.html#y\n |title=Astronomical Almanac for the Year 2011\n |year=2009\n |publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office and the U.K. Hydrographic Office\n |location = Washington and Taunton\n |page = M18 (Glossary)\n}}</ref> (= 365.24219 days of 86400 SI seconds)\n\nThe anomalistic year is the time taken for the Earth to complete one revolution with respect to its [[Apsis|apsides]]. The orbit of the Earth is elliptical; the extreme points, called apsides, are the [[perihelion]], where the Earth is closest to the Sun (January 5, 07:48 UT in 2020), and the [[aphelion]], where the Earth is farthest from the Sun (July 4 11:35 UT in 2020). The anomalistic year is usually defined as the time between perihelion passages.  Its average duration is 365.259636 days (365 d 6 h 13 min 52.6 s) (at the epoch J2011.0).<ref>\n{{cite book\n |title=Astronomical Almanac for the Year 2011\n |year=2009\n |publisher = [[US Government Printing Office]] and the [[UK Hydrographic Office]]\n |location = Washington and Taunton\n |pages = A1, C2\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Draconic year {{anchor|Draconitic year}} ===\n{{further|Draconic period}}\nThe draconic year, draconitic year, eclipse year, or ecliptic year is the time taken for the Sun (as seen from the Earth) to complete one revolution with respect to the same [[lunar node]] (a point where the Moon's orbit intersects the ecliptic). The year is associated with [[eclipse]]s: these occur only when both the Sun and the Moon are near these nodes; so eclipses occur within about a month of every half eclipse year. Hence there are two [[eclipse season]]s every eclipse year. The average duration of the eclipse year is\n:{{val|346.620075883}} days (346 d 14 h 52 min 54 s) (at the epoch J2000.0).\n\nThis term is sometimes erroneously used for the draconic or nodal period of [[lunar precession]], that is the period of a complete revolution of the Moon's ascending node around the ecliptic: {{val|18.612815932}} Julian years ({{val|6798.331019}} days; at the epoch J2000.0).\n\n=== Full moon cycle ===\nThe [[full moon cycle]] is the time for the Sun (as seen from the Earth) to complete one revolution with respect to the [[perigee]] of the Moon's orbit. This period is associated with the apparent size of the [[full moon]], and also with the varying duration of the [[month|synodic month]]. The duration of one full moon cycle is:\n:{{val|411.78443029}} days (411 days 18 hours 49 minutes 35 seconds) (at the epoch J2000.0).\n\n=== Lunar year ===\nThe [[lunar year]] comprises twelve full cycles of the phases of the Moon, as seen from Earth. It has a duration of approximately 354.37 days. [[Muslims]] use this for celebrating their [[Muslim holidays|Eids]] and for marking the start of the fasting month of [[Ramadan]].\nA Muslim calendar year is based on the lunar cycle.\n\n=== Vague year ===\nThe vague year, from ''annus vagus'' or wandering year, is an integral approximation to the year equaling 365 days, which wanders in relation to more exact years.  Typically the vague year is divided into 12 [[wikt:schematic|schematic]] months of 30 days each plus 5 [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|epagomenal]] days.  The vague year was used in the calendars of [[Ethiopian calendar|Ethiopia]], [[Egyptian calendar|Ancient Egypt]], [[Iranian calendar|Iran]], [[Armenian calendar|Armenia]] and in [[Mesoamerican calendars|Mesoamerica]] among the [[Aztec calendar|Aztecs]] and [[Haab'|Maya]].<ref>[http://www.mayacalendar.com/descripcion.html Calendar Description and Coordination] Maya World Studies Center</ref>   It is still used by many Zoroastrian communities.\n\n=== Heliacal year ===\nA heliacal year is the interval between the [[heliacal rising]]s of a star. It differs from the [[sidereal year]] for stars away from the [[ecliptic]] due mainly to the [[precession of the equinoxes]].\n\n=== Sothic year ===\nThe [[Sothic cycle|Sothic year]] is the interval between heliacal risings of the star [[Sirius]]. It is currently less than the [[#Sidereal, tropical, and anomalistic years|sidereal year]] and its duration is very close to the Julian year of 365.25 days.\n\n=== Gaussian year ===\nThe [[Gaussian year]] is the sidereal year for a planet of negligible mass (relative to the Sun) and unperturbed by other planets that is governed by the [[Gaussian gravitational constant]]. Such a planet would be slightly closer to the Sun than Earth's mean distance. Its length is:\n:{{val|365.2568983}} days (365 d 6 h 9 min 56 s).\n\n=== Besselian year === <!-- This section is linked from [[Universal Time]] -->\nThe [[Besselian epoch#Besselian years|Besselian year]] is a tropical year that starts when the (fictitious) mean Sun reaches an ecliptic longitude of 280\u00b0. This is currently on or close to January 1. It is named after the 19th-century German astronomer and mathematician [[Friedrich Bessel]]. The following equation can be used to compute the current Besselian epoch (in years):<ref>\n{{cite book\n |title=Astronomical Almanac for the Year 2010\n |year=2008\n |publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office and the U.K. Hydrographic Office\n |location = Washington and Taunton\n |page = B3\n|title-link=Astronomical Almanac\n }}</ref>\n: B = 1900.0 + (Julian date<sub>TT</sub> \u2212 {{val|2415020.31352}}) / {{val|365.242198781}}\n\nThe TT subscript indicates that for this formula, the Julian date should use the [[Terrestrial Time]] scale, or its predecessor, [[ephemeris time]].<!-- Capitalization follows that of the glossary of the ''Astronomical Almanac for the Year 2010'' -->\n\n=== Variation in the length of the year and the day ===\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2012}}\nThe exact length of an astronomical year changes over time.\n* The positions of the equinox and solstice points with respect to the apsides of Earth's orbit change: the equinoxes and solstices move westward relative to the stars because of [[precession]], and the apsides move in the other direction because of the long-term effects of gravitational pull by the other planets.  Since the speed of the Earth varies according to its position in its orbit as measured from its perihelion, Earth's speed when in a solstice or equinox point changes over time: if such a point moves toward perihelion, the interval between two passages decreases a little from year to year; if the point moves towards aphelion, that period increases a little from year to year.  So a \"tropical year\" measured from one passage of the northward (\"vernal\") equinox to the next, differs from the one measured between passages of the southward (\"autumnal\") equinox.  The average over the full orbit does not change because of this, so the length of the average tropical year does not change because of this second-order effect.\n* Each planet's movement is perturbed by the gravity of every other planet.  This leads to short-term fluctuations in its speed, and therefore its period from year to year.  Moreover, it causes long-term changes in its orbit, and therefore also long-term changes in these periods.\n* [[Tidal drag]] between the Earth and the Moon and Sun increases the length of the day and of the month (by transferring angular momentum from the rotation of the Earth to the revolution of the Moon); since the apparent mean solar day is the unit with which we measure the length of the year in civil life, the length of the year appears to decrease.  The rotation rate of the Earth is also changed by factors such as [[post-glacial rebound]] and [[sea level rise]].\n\n==== Numerical value of year variation ====\n\nMean year lengths in this section are calculated for 2000, and differences in year lengths, compared to 2000, are given for past and future years.

The unit of time is the modern year as presently recognized worldwide.  Recommended (but not mandatory) abbreviations for such ages are SI (International System of Units) multipliers coupled with \"a\" for annus: ka, Ma, and Ga for kilo-annus (10<sup>3</sup> years), Mega-annus (10<sup>6</sup> years), and Giga-annus (10<sup>9</sup> years), respectively. Use of these terms after the age value follows the convention established in the field of C-14 dating. The \"present\" refers to AD 1950, and such qualifiers as \"ago\" or \"before the present\" are omitted after the value because measurement of the duration from the present to the past is implicit in the designation. In contrast, the duration of a remote interval of geologic time, as a number of years, should not be expressed by the same symbols. Abbreviations for numbers of years, without reference to the present, are informal (e.g., y or yr for years; my, m.y., or m.yr. for millions of years; and so forth, as preference dictates). For example, boundaries of the Late Cretaceous Epoch currently are calibrated at 63 Ma and 96 Ma, but the interval of time represented by this epoch is 33 m.y.\n}}</ref> They are not SI units, using ''y'' to abbreviate the English \"[[:wikt:year|year]]\", but following ambiguous international recommendations, use either the standard English first letters as prefixes (t, m, and b) or [[metric prefix]]es (k, M, and G) or variations on metric prefixes (k, m, g).

Due to the Earth's [[axial tilt]], the course of a year sees the passing of the [[season]]s, marked by change in [[weather]], the hours of [[daylight]], and, consequently, [[vegetation]] and [[soil fertility]].\nIn [[temperate]] and [[subpolar climate|subpolar]] regions around the planet, four seasons are generally recognized: [[spring (season)|spring]], [[summer]], [[autumn]], and [[winter]]. In [[tropics|tropical]] and [[subtropics|subtropical]] regions, several geographical sectors do not present defined seasons; but in the [[tropics#Seasons and climate|seasonal tropics]], the annual [[wet season|wet]] and [[dry season]]s are recognized and tracked.\n\nA [[calendar year]] is an approximation of the number of days of the Earth's orbital period, as counted in a given [[calendar]]. The [[Gregorian calendar]], or modern calendar, presents its calendar year to be either a [[common year]] of 365 days or a [[leap year]] of 366 days, as do the [[Julian calendar]]s; ''see'' [[#In international calendars|below]]. For the Gregorian calendar, the average length of the calendar year (the mean year) across the complete leap cycle of 400 years is 365.2425 days. The [[ISO]] standard [[ISO 80000-3]], Annex C, supports the symbol ''a'' (for Latin ''[[:wikt:annus|annus]]'') to represent a year of either 365 or 366 days. In English, the abbreviations ''y'' and ''yr'' are commonly used.\n\nIn astronomy, the [[Julian year (astronomy)|Julian year]] is a [[unit of time]]; it is defined as 365.25 [[day]]s of exactly 86,400 [[second]]s ([[SI base unit]]), totalling exactly 31,557,600 seconds in the Julian astronomical year.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] |url=http://www.iau.org/science/publications/proceedings_rules/units/ |title=SI units |accessdate=February 18, 2010}} (See Table 5 and Section 5.15.)

The term can also be used in reference to any long period or cycle, such as the [[Great Year]].<ref>[[OED]], s.v. \"year\", entry 2.b.: \"''transf.''

Cognates also descended from the same Proto-Indo-European noun (with variation in suffix [[ablaut]]) are [[Avestan]] ''y\u0101r\u01dd'' \"year\", [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u1f65\u03c1\u03b1}} (h\u1e53ra) \"year, season, period of time\" (whence \"[[hour]]\"), [[Old Church Slavonic]] ''jar\u016d'', and [[Latin]] ''hornus'' \"of this year\". <!--root [[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/h\u2081ey-]] \"go\", needs reference to deal with the \"laryingealistic\" problems-->\n\nLatin ''[[:wikt:annus|annus]]'' (a [[2nd declension]] masculine noun; ''annum'' is the [[accusative case|accusative singular]]; ''ann\u012b'' is genitive singular and nominative plural; ''ann\u014d'' the dative and ablative singular) is from a [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] noun ''{{PIE|*h\u2082et-no-}}'', which also yielded Gothic ''a\u00fen'' \"year\" (only the dative plural ''a\u00fenam'' is attested).\n\nAlthough most languages treat the word as thematic ''*yeh\u2081r-o-'', there is evidence for an original derivation with an ''*-r/n'' suffix, ''*yeh\u2081-ro-''. Both Indo-European words for year, ''*yeh\u2081-ro-'' and ''*h\u2082et-no-'', would then be derived from verbal roots meaning \"to go, move\", ''*h\u2081ey-'' and ''*h\u2082et-'', respectively  (compare [[Vedic Sanskrit]] ''\u00e9ti'' \"goes\", ''atasi'' \"thou goest, wanderest\").\nA number of English words are derived from Latin ''annus'', such as [[wikt:annual|annual]], [[:wikt:annuity|annuity]], [[:wikt:anniversary|anniversary]], etc.; ''[[:wikt:per annum|per annum]]'' means \"each year\", ''[[anno Domini]]'' means \"in the year of the Lord\".\n\nThe Greek word for \"year\", {{lang|grc|\u1f14\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2}}, is cognate with Latin ''vetus'' \"old\", from the PIE word ''*wetos-'' \"year\", also preserved in this meaning in [[Sanskrit]]  ''{{IAST|vat-sa-ras}}'' \"year\" and ''{{IAST|vat-sa-}}'' \"yearling (calf)\", the latter also reflected in Latin ''[[:wikt:vitulus|vitulus]]'' \"bull calf\",  English ''wether'' \"ram\" (Old English ''we\u00f0er'', Gothic ''wi\u00ferus'' \"lamb\").\n\nIn some languages, it is common to count years by referencing to one season, as in \"summers\", or \"winters\", or \"harvests\". Examples include Chinese [[:wikt:\u5e74|\u5e74]] \"year\", originally [[:wikt:\u79c2|\u79c2]], an ideographic compound of a person carrying a bundle of wheat denoting \"harvest\". Slavic besides ''[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/god\u044a|god\u016d]]'' \"time period; year\" uses ''[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/l\u011bto|l\u011bto]]'' \"summer; year\".\n\nIn the [[International System of Quantities]] ([[ISO 80000-3]]), the year (symbol, ''a'') is defined as either 365 days or 366 days.\n\n== Intercalation ==\nAstronomical years do not have an [[integer]] number of days or lunar months. Any calendar that follows an astronomical year must have a system of [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalation]] such as leap years.\n\n=== Julian calendar ===\nIn the Julian calendar, the average (mean) length of a year is 365.25 days. In a non-leap year, there are 365 days, in a leap year there are 366 days. A leap year occurs every fourth year, or leap year, during which a leap day is [[intercalation (timekeeping)#Solar calendars|intercalated]] into the month of February. The name \"[[Leap Day]]\" is applied to the added day.\n\nThe [[Revised Julian calendar]], proposed in 1923 and used in some [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es,\nhas 218 leap years every 900 years, for  the average (mean) year length of {{val|365.2422222}} days, close to the length of the mean tropical year, {{val|365.24219}} days (relative error of 9\u00b710<sup>\u22128</sup>).\nIn the year 2800 CE, the Gregorian and Revised Julian calendars will begin to differ by one calendar day.<ref>Shields, Miriam Nancy.

It is estimated that by the year 4000 CE, the northward equinox will fall back by one day in the Gregorian calendar, not because of this difference, but due to the slowing of the Earth's rotation and the associated lengthening of the day.\n\n===Other calendars===\n{{see|Lunisolar calendar}}\nHistorically, lunisolar calendars intercalated entire [[leap month]]s on an observational basis.\nLunisolar calendars have mostly fallen out of use except for liturgical reasons ([[Hebrew calendar]], various [[Hindu calendar]]s).\n\nA modern adaptation of the historical [[Jalali calendar]], known as the [[Solar Hijri calendar]] (1925), is a purely [[solar calendar]] with an irregular pattern of leap days based on observation (or astronomical computation), aiming to place new year ([[Nowruz]]) on the day of [[vernal equinox]] (for the time zone of [[Tehran]]), as opposed to using an algorithmic system of leap years.\n\n==Year numbering==\nA [[calendar era]] assigns a [[cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal number]] to each sequential  year, using a reference point in the past as the beginning of the era.\n\nThe worldwide standard is the [[Anno Domini]], although some prefer the term [[Common Era]] because it has no explicit reference to [[Christianity]]. It was introduced in the 6th century and was intended to count years from the [[nativity of Jesus]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Richards |first=E.G. |date=2013 |contribution=Calendars |editor1-first=S.E. |editor1-last=Urban |editor2-first=P.K. |editor2-last=Seidelmann |url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/publications/docs/c15_usb_online.pdf |title=Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac |edition=3rd |pages=585, 590 |location=Mill Valley, CA |publisher=University Science Books |isbn=978-1-891389-85-6}} Richards does not explicitly say that Anno Domini is the worldwide standard, but does say on page 585 that the Gregorian calendar is used throughout the world for secular purposes.</ref>\n\nThe Anno Domini era is given the Latin abbreviation AD (for [[Anno Domini]] \"in the year of the Lord\"), or alternatively CE for \"[[Common Era]]\". Years before AD 1 are abbreviated BC for [[Before Christ]] or alternatively BCE for [[Before the Common Era]].\nYear numbers are based on [[inclusive counting]], so that there is no \"year zero\".\nIn the modern alternative reckoning of [[Astronomical year numbering]], positive numbers indicate years AD, the number [[0 (year)|0]] designates [[1 BC]], \u22121 designates [[2 BC]], and so on.\n\n==Pragmatic divisions==\nFinancial and scientific calculations often use a [[365-day calendar]] to simplify daily rates.\n\n=== Fiscal year ===\nA [[fiscal year]] or financial year is a 12-month period used for calculating annual financial statements in businesses and other organizations. In many jurisdictions, regulations regarding accounting require such reports once per twelve months, but do not require that the twelve months constitute a calendar year.\n\nFor example, in [[Canada]] and [[India]] the fiscal year runs from April 1; in the [[United Kingdom]] it runs from April 1 for purposes of corporation tax and government financial statements, but from April 6 for purposes of personal taxation and payment of state benefits;  in [[Australia]] it runs from July 1; while in the [[United States]] the fiscal year of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] runs from October 1.\n\n=== Academic year ===\nAn academic year is the annual period during which a student attends an [[educational institution]]. The academic year may be divided into [[academic term]]s, such as semesters or quarters. The school year in many countries starts in August or September and ends in May, June or July.  In Israel the academic year begins around October or November, aligned with the second month of the [[Hebrew Calendar]].\n\nSome schools in the UK and USA divide the academic year into ''three'' roughly equal-length terms (called ''trimesters'' or ''quarters'' in the USA), roughly coinciding with autumn, winter, and spring. At some, a shortened summer session, sometimes considered part of the regular academic year, is attended by students on a voluntary or elective basis.  Other schools break the year into ''two'' main semesters, a first (typically August through December) and a second semester (January through May). Each of these main semesters may be split in half by mid-term exams, and each of the halves is referred to as a ''quarter'' (or ''term'' in some countries). There may also be a voluntary summer session and/or a short January session.\n\nSome other schools, including some in the United States, have ''four'' marking periods.  Some schools in the United States, notably [[Boston Latin School]], may divide the year into ''five or more'' marking periods. Some state in defense of this that there is perhaps a [[positive correlation]] between report frequency and academic achievement.\n\nThere are typically 180 days of teaching each year in schools in the US, excluding weekends and breaks, while there are 190 days for pupils in state schools in Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, and 200 for pupils in Australia.\n\nIn India the academic year normally starts from June 1 and ends on May 31. Though schools start closing from mid-March, the actual academic closure is on May 31 and in Nepal it starts from July 15.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nSchools and universities in Australia typically have academic years that roughly align with the calendar year (i.e., starting in February or March and ending in October to December), as the southern hemisphere experiences summer from December to February.\n\n== Astronomical years == <!-- This section is linked from [[Season]] -->\n{{see also|Astronomical month}}\n\n=== Julian year ===\n{{Main|Julian year (astronomy)}}\nThe Julian year, as used in astronomy and other sciences, is a time unit defined as exactly 365.25 days. This is the normal meaning of the unit \"year\" (symbol \"a\" from the [[Latin]] ''annus'') used in various scientific contexts. The Julian century of {{val|36525}} days and the Julian millennium of {{val|365250}} days are used in astronomical calculations. Fundamentally, expressing a time interval in Julian years is a way to precisely specify how many days (not how many \"real\" years), for long time intervals where stating the number of days would be unwieldy and unintuitive. By convention, the Julian year is used in the computation of the distance covered by a [[light-year]].\n\nIn the [[Unified Code for Units of Measure]], the symbol, ''a'' (without subscript), always refers to the Julian year, ''a<sub>j</sub>'', of exactly {{val|31557600}} [[second]]s.\n\n:365.25 days of {{val|86400}} seconds = 1 a = 1 a<sub>j</sub> = {{val|31.5576}} [[Second#SI multiples|Ms]]\n\nThe [[#SI prefix multipliers|SI multiplier prefixes]] may be applied to it to form ''ka'' (kiloannus), ''Ma'' (megaannus), etc.\n\n=== Sidereal, tropical, and anomalistic years ===\n{{hatnote|The relations among these are considered more fully in [[Axial precession (astronomy)]].}}\n\nEach of these three years can be loosely called an ''astronomical year''.\n\nThe [[sidereal year]] is the time taken for the Earth to complete one revolution of its [[orbit]], as measured against a fixed frame of reference (such as the fixed stars, Latin ''sidera'', singular ''sidus'').  Its average duration is {{val|365.256363004}} days (365 d 6 h 9 min 9.76 s) (at the epoch [[J2000.0]] = January 1, 2000, 12:00:00 [[Terrestrial Time|TT]]).<ref>International Earth Rotation and Reference System Service.

Because of the Earth's [[axial precession (astronomy)|axial precession]], this year is about 20 minutes shorter than the sidereal year.  The mean tropical year is approximately 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 45 seconds, using the modern definition.<ref>\n{{cite book\n |url=http://asa.usno.navy.mil/SecM/Glossary.html#y\n |title=Astronomical Almanac for the Year 2011\n |year=2009\n |publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office and the U.K. Hydrographic Office\n |location = Washington and Taunton\n |page = M18 (Glossary)\n}}</ref> (= 365.24219 days of 86400 SI seconds)\n\nThe anomalistic year is the time taken for the Earth to complete one revolution with respect to its [[Apsis|apsides]]. The orbit of the Earth is elliptical; the extreme points, called apsides, are the [[perihelion]], where the Earth is closest to the Sun (January 5, 07:48 UT in 2020), and the [[aphelion]], where the Earth is farthest from the Sun (July 4 11:35 UT in 2020). The anomalistic year is usually defined as the time between perihelion passages.

The year is associated with [[eclipse]]s: these occur only when both the Sun and the Moon are near these nodes; so eclipses occur within about a month of every half eclipse year. Hence there are two [[eclipse season]]s every eclipse year. The average duration of the eclipse year is\n:{{val|346.620075883}} days (346 d 14 h 52 min 54 s) (at the epoch J2000.0).\n\nThis term is sometimes erroneously used for the draconic or nodal period of [[lunar precession]], that is the period of a complete revolution of the Moon's ascending node around the ecliptic: {{val|18.612815932}} Julian years ({{val|6798.331019}} days; at the epoch J2000.0).\n\n=== Full moon cycle ===\nThe [[full moon cycle]] is the time for the Sun (as seen from the Earth) to complete one revolution with respect to the [[perigee]] of the Moon's orbit. This period is associated with the apparent size of the [[full moon]], and also with the varying duration of the [[month|synodic month]]. The duration of one full moon cycle is:\n:{{val|411.78443029}} days (411 days 18 hours 49 minutes 35 seconds) (at the epoch J2000.0).\n\n=== Lunar year ===\nThe [[lunar year]] comprises twelve full cycles of the phases of the Moon, as seen from Earth. It has a duration of approximately 354.37 days. [[Muslims]] use this for celebrating their [[Muslim holidays|Eids]] and for marking the start of the fasting month of [[Ramadan]].\nA Muslim calendar year is based on the lunar cycle.\n\n=== Vague year ===\nThe vague year, from ''annus vagus'' or wandering year, is an integral approximation to the year equaling 365 days, which wanders in relation to more exact years.  Typically the vague year is divided into 12 [[wikt:schematic|schematic]] months of 30 days each plus 5 [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|epagomenal]] days.  The vague year was used in the calendars of [[Ethiopian calendar|Ethiopia]], [[Egyptian calendar|Ancient Egypt]], [[Iranian calendar|Iran]], [[Armenian calendar|Armenia]] and in [[Mesoamerican calendars|Mesoamerica]] among the [[Aztec calendar|Aztecs]] and [[Haab'|Maya]].<ref>[http://www.mayacalendar.com/descripcion.html Calendar Description and Coordination] Maya World Studies Center</ref>   It is still used by many Zoroastrian communities.\n\n=== Heliacal year ===\nA heliacal year is the interval between the [[heliacal rising]]s of a star. It differs from the [[sidereal year]] for stars away from the [[ecliptic]] due mainly to the [[precession of the equinoxes]].\n\n=== Sothic year ===\nThe [[Sothic cycle|Sothic year]] is the interval between heliacal risings of the star [[Sirius]]. It is currently less than the [[#Sidereal, tropical, and anomalistic years|sidereal year]] and its duration is very close to the Julian year of 365.25 days.\n\n=== Gaussian year ===\nThe [[Gaussian year]] is the sidereal year for a planet of negligible mass (relative to the Sun) and unperturbed by other planets that is governed by the [[Gaussian gravitational constant]]. Such a planet would be slightly closer to the Sun than Earth's mean distance. Its length is:\n:{{val|365.2568983}} days (365 d 6 h 9 min 56 s).\n\n=== Besselian year === <!-- This section is linked from [[Universal Time]] -->\nThe [[Besselian epoch#Besselian years|Besselian year]] is a tropical year that starts when the (fictitious) mean Sun reaches an ecliptic longitude of 280\u00b0.

Since the speed of the Earth varies according to its position in its orbit as measured from its perihelion, Earth's speed when in a solstice or equinox point changes over time: if such a point moves toward perihelion, the interval between two passages decreases a little from year to year; if the point moves towards aphelion, that period increases a little from year to year.  So a \"tropical year\" measured from one passage of the northward (\"vernal\") equinox to the next, differs from the one measured between passages of the southward (\"autumnal\") equinox.  The average over the full orbit does not change because of this, so the length of the average tropical year does not change because of this second-order effect.\n* Each planet's movement is perturbed by the gravity of every other planet.  This leads to short-term fluctuations in its speed, and therefore its period from year to year.  Moreover, it causes long-term changes in its orbit, and therefore also long-term changes in these periods.\n* [[Tidal drag]] between the Earth and the Moon and Sun increases the length of the day and of the month (by transferring angular momentum from the rotation of the Earth to the revolution of the Moon); since the apparent mean solar day is the unit with which we measure the length of the year in civil life, the length of the year appears to decrease.  The rotation rate of the Earth is also changed by factors such as [[post-glacial rebound]] and [[sea level rise]].\n\n==== Numerical value of year variation ====\n\nMean year lengths in this section are calculated for 2000, and differences in year lengths, compared to 2000, are given for past and future years.

The unit of time is the modern year as presently recognized worldwide.  Recommended (but not mandatory) abbreviations for such ages are SI (International System of Units) multipliers coupled with \"a\" for annus: ka, Ma, and Ga for kilo-annus (10<sup>3</sup> years), Mega-annus (10<sup>6</sup> years), and Giga-annus (10<sup>9</sup> years), respectively. Use of these terms after the age value follows the convention established in the field of C-14 dating. The \"present\" refers to AD 1950, and such qualifiers as \"ago\" or \"before the present\" are omitted after the value because measurement of the duration from the present to the past is implicit in the designation. In contrast, the duration of a remote interval of geologic time, as a number of years, should not be expressed by the same symbols. Abbreviations for numbers of years, without reference to the present, are informal (e.g., y or yr for years; my, m.y., or m.yr. for millions of years; and so forth, as preference dictates). For example, boundaries of the Late Cretaceous Epoch currently are calibrated at 63 Ma and 96 Ma, but the interval of time represented by this epoch is 33 m.y.\n}}</ref> They are not SI units, using ''y'' to abbreviate the English \"[[:wikt:year|year]]\", but following ambiguous international recommendations, use either the standard English first letters as prefixes (t, m, and b) or [[metric prefix]]es (k, M, and G) or variations on metric prefixes (k, m, g). In archaeology, dealing with more recent periods, normally expressed dates, e.g. \"22,000 years ago\" may be used as a more accessible equivalent of a [[Before Present]] (\"BP\") date.\n\nThese abbreviations include:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! {{Anchor|mya}}Non-SI abbreviation\n!
