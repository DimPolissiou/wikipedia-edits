{"title_page": "Frank Lovell", "text_new": "{{no footnotes| date=October 2011}}\n{{Trotskyism}}\n\n'''Frank Lovell''' (July 24, 1913 \u2013 May 1, 1998) was an American [[Communism|communist]] politician.\n\nLovell was born in [[Ipava]], a town situated in the farming district of [[Illinois]]. Lovell studied psychology at the [[University of California]] in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]].

Achim Christoph Friedrich Schulz in his ''Kleine Romane'' (1790), which was the Grimms' direct source, the owner of the garden is a [[fairy]] (\"''Fee''\"), and also appears as such in the Grimms' first edition of ''Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen'' (1812); by the final edition of 1857 the Grimms had deliberately Germanized the story by changing her to the more Teutonic \"sorceress\" (\"''Zauberin''\"), just as they had changed the original \"prince\" (\"''Prinz''\") to the Germanic \"son of a king\" (\"''K\u00f6nigssohn''\"). At no point, however, do they refer to her as a \"[[witch]]\" ({{lang-de|Hexe}}), despite the common modern impression.</ref> The wife, experiencing the cravings associated with pregnancy, notices some [[Valerianella locusta|rapunzel]] (a salad green) growing in the nearby garden and longs for it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://german.berkeley.edu/poetry/rapunzel.php|title=Translating Rapunzel; A very Long Process|last=Rinkes|first=Kathleen J.|date=17 April 2001|website=Department of German: University of California Berkeley|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122211814/http://german.berkeley.edu/poetry/rapunzel.php|archive-date=24 September 2017|access-date=30 March 2020}}</ref> She refuses to eat anything else and begins to waste away. Her husband fears for her life and one night he breaks into the garden to get some for her. When he returns, she makes a salad out of it and eats it, but she longs for more so her husband returns to the garden to retrieve more. As he scales the wall to return home, the sorceress catches him and accuses him of theft. He begs for mercy and she agrees to be lenient, allowing him to take all the rapunzel he wants on condition that the baby be given to her when it's born.<ref>In some variants of the story, the request takes a more riddling form, ''e. g.,'' the foster mother demands \"that which is under your belt.\" In other variants, the mother, worn out by the squalling of the child, wishes for someone to take it away, whereupon the figure of the foster-mother appears to claim it. ''Cf.'' the Grimms' annotations to ''Rapunzel'' (''Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen'' (1856), Vol. III, p. 22.)</ref> Desperate, he agrees. When his wife has a baby girl, the sorceress takes her to raise as her own and names her \"Rapunzel\" after the plant her mother craved. She grows up to be a beautiful child with long golden hair.<ref>In Schulz, this is caused by the fairy herself, who sprinkles the child with a \"precious liquid/perfume/ointment\" ({{lang-de|kostbaren Wasser}}). Her hair according to Schulz is thirty ells long (112 1/2 feet or 34.29 meters), but not at all uncomfortable for her to wear (''Kleine Romane'', p. 277); in the Grimms, it hangs twenty ells (75 feet/22.86 meters) from the window-hook to the ground. (''Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen'' (1857) Vol. I., p. 66.).</ref> When she turns twelve, the sorceress locks her up inside a tower in the middle of the woods, with neither stairs nor a door, and only one room and one window.<ref>In Schulz's 1790 version of the story, the purpose of the fairy in doing so is to protect Rapunzel from an \"unlucky star\" which threatens her (''Kleine Romane'', p. 275); the Grimms (deliberately seeking to return to a more archaic form of the story and perhaps influenced by Basile's Italian variant) make the fairy/sorceress a much more threatening figure.</ref> In order to visit Rapunzel, the sorceress stands beneath the tower and calls out:\n\n:''Rapunzel!''\n:''Rapunzel!''\n:''Let down your hair''\n:''That I may climb thy golden stair!''<ref>Schulz, \"''Rapunzel, la\u00df deine Haare 'runter, da\u00df ich 'rauf kann.''\" ({{lang-de|Rapunzel, let down thy hairs, so I can [climb] up.}}) (''Kleine Romane'', p. 278); Grimms, \"''Rapunzel, Rapunzel, la\u00df dein Haar herunter!'' ({{lang-de|Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let downwards thy hair!}}) (''Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen'' (1857) Vol. I., p. 66.) Jacob Grimm believed that the strong alliteration of the rhyme indicated that it was a survival of the ancient form of Germanic poetry known as \"''[[Stabreim]]''.\"</ref>\n\nOne day, a [[prince]] rides through the forest and hears Rapunzel singing from the tower. Entranced by her ethereal voice, he searches for her and discovers the tower, but is unable to enter it. He returns often, listening to her beautiful singing, and one day sees the sorceress visit and learns how to gain access. When the sorceress leaves, he bids Rapunzel let her hair down. When she does so, he climbs up and they fall in love. He eventually asks her to [[Marriage|marry]] him, which she agrees to. \n\nTogether they plan a means of escape, wherein he will come each night (thus avoiding the sorceress who visits her by day) and bring Rapunzel a piece of [[silk]] that she will gradually weave into a [[rope ladder|ladder]]. Before the plan can come to fruition, however, she foolishly gives him away. In the first edition (1812) of ''Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen'' ({{lang-de|Children's and Household Tales}}, most commonly known in English as ''[[Grimm's Fairy Tales]]''), she innocently says that her dress is growing tighter around her waist, hinting at [[pregnancy]].<ref>This detail is also found in Schulz, ''Kleine Romane'', p. 281.</ref> In later editions, she asks \"Dame Gothel\"<ref>{{lang-de|Frau Gothel}}. Rapunzel refers to the previously unnamed sorceress by this title only at this point in the Grimms' story. The use of ''Frau'' in early modern German was more restricted, and referred only to a woman of noble birth, rather than to any woman as in modern German.  \"''Gothel''\" (or ''G\u00f6thel, G\u00f6thle, G\u00f6the, etc''.) was originally not a personal name, but an occupational one meaning \"[[midwife]], [[wet nurse]], [[foster mother]], [[Godparent]]\" ({{lang-de|Amme, Ammefrau; Taufpate}}). ''Cf.'' Ernst Ludwig Rochholz's ''Deutsche Arbeits-Entw\u00fcrfe'', Vol. II, p. 150. The Grimms' use of this archaic term was another example of their attempt to return the story to a primitive Teutonic form.</ref>, in a moment of forgetfulness, why it is easier for her to draw up the prince than her.<ref name=facts>Maria Tatar (1987) ''The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales'', Princeton University Press, p. 18, {{ISBN|0-691-06722-8}}</ref>  In anger, the sorceress cuts off Rapunzel's hair and casts her out into the wilderness to fend for herself.\n\nWhen the prince calls that night, the sorceress lets the severed hair down to haul him up. To his horror, he finds himself meeting her instead of Rapunzel, who is nowhere to be found. After she tells him in a rage that he will never see Rapunzel again, he leaps or falls from the tower, landing in a thorn bush. Although the thorn bush breaks his fall and saves his life, it scratches his eyes and blinds him.\n\nFor years, he wanders through the wastelands of the country and eventually comes to the wilderness where Rapunzel now lives with the twins to whom she has given birth, a boy and a girl. One day, as she sings, he hears her voice again, and they are reunited. When they fall into each other's arms her tears immediately restore his sight. He leads her and their twins to his kingdom where they live happily ever after.<ref>In Schulz, the fairy, relenting from her anger, transports the whole family to his father's palace in her flying carriage. ''Kleine Romane'', pp. 287-288.</ref>\n\nAnother version of the story ends with the revelation that her foster mother, the evil sorceress Dame Gothel, had untied Rapunzel's hair after the prince leapt from the tower, and it slipped from her hands and landed far below, leaving her trapped in the tower.<ref name=\"wbarker\">Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm (1884) ''Household Tales'' (English translation by Margaretmm Hunt), \"[http://myweb.dal.ca/barkerb/fairies/grimm/012.html Rapunzel]\"</ref>\n\n==Themes and characterization==\n[[File:Dresden Altmarkt 14.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Rapunzel in [[Dresden]], [[Saxony]], Germany]]\nMany scholars have interpreted \u201cMaiden in the Tower\u201d stories, which Rapunzel is a part of, as a metaphor for the protection of young woman from pre-marital relationships by overzealous guardians.<ref name=\":2\" /> Scholars have drawn comparisons of the confinement of Rapunzel in her tower to that of a convent, where women\u2019s lives where highly controlled and they lived in exclusion from outsiders.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nScholars have also noted the strong theme of love conquering all in the story, as the lovers are united after years of searching in all versions after ''[[Charlotte-Rose de Caumont de La Force|Persinette]]'' and are ultimately happily reunited as a family.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Vellenga|first=Carolyn|date=1992|title=Rapunzel's desire.

It aired on 5 February 1983. In it, the main character, Rapunzel ([[Shelley Duvall]]), is taken from her mother ([[Shelley Duvall]]) and father ([[Jeff Bridges]]) by an evil witch ([[Gena Rowlands]]), and is brought up in an isolated tower that can only be accessed by climbing her unnaturally long hair.

The difference from the play is that Rapunzel is not killed by the Giant's Wife. Instead, she rides off into the woods with her prince in order to distance herself from the Witch that raised her.\n* In ''[[Barbie as Rapunzel]]'' (2002), Rapunzel was raised by the evil witch Gothel (voiced by [[Anjelica Huston]]) and she acted as a servant for her. She uses a magic paintbrush to get out of captivity, but Gothel locks her away in a tower.\n* In ''[[Shrek the Third]]'' (2007), Rapunzel (voiced by [[Maya Rudolph]]) was friends with Princess Fiona. She is shown to be the true love of the evil Prince Charming and helps to fool Princess Fiona and her group when they try to escape from Prince Charming's wrath.\n* [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]]' ''[[Tangled]]'' (2010), which is a loose retelling and a computer-animated musical feature film.

After Prince Charming begins to fear that he will not make a good father to his and Snow White's baby, Robin Hood tells him where to find the night-root. He then climbs the tower and eventually helps Rapunzel face her fears by facing what truly scares her, which is herself. Presented with her own doppelganger, she is encouraged by Prince Charming and cuts off her hair, killing the figure and allowing her freedom. She explains to Prince Charming that her brother died trying to save her, and she doubts that her parents will forgive her.

Achim Christoph Friedrich Schulz in his ''Kleine Romane'' (1790), which was the Grimms' direct source, the owner of the garden is a [[fairy]] (\"''Fee''\"), and also appears as such in the Grimms' first edition of ''Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen'' (1812); by the final edition of 1857 the Grimms had deliberately Germanized the story by changing her to the more Teutonic \"sorceress\" (\"''Zauberin''\"), just as they had changed the original \"prince\" (\"''Prinz''\") to the Germanic \"son of a king\" (\"''K\u00f6nigssohn''\"). At no point, however, do they refer to her as a \"[[witch]]\" ({{lang-de|Hexe}}), despite the common modern impression.</ref> The wife, experiencing the cravings associated with pregnancy, notices some [[Valerianella locusta|rapunzel]] (a salad green) growing in the nearby garden and longs for it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://german.berkeley.edu/poetry/rapunzel.php|title=Translating Rapunzel; A very Long Process|last=Rinkes|first=Kathleen J.|date=17 April 2001|website=Department of German: University of California Berkeley|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122211814/http://german.berkeley.edu/poetry/rapunzel.php|archive-date=24 September 2017|access-date=30 March 2020}}</ref> She refuses to eat anything else and begins to waste away. Her husband fears for her life and one night he breaks into the garden to get some for her. When he returns, she makes a salad out of it and eats it, but she longs for more so her husband returns to the garden to retrieve more. As he scales the wall to return home, the sorceress catches him and accuses him of theft. He begs for mercy and she agrees to be lenient, allowing him to take all the rapunzel he wants on condition that the baby be given to her when it's born.<ref>In some variants of the story, the request takes a more riddling form, ''e. g.,'' the foster mother demands \"that which is under your belt.\" In other variants, the mother, worn out by the squalling of the child, wishes for someone to take it away, whereupon the figure of the foster-mother appears to claim it. ''Cf.'' the Grimms' annotations to ''Rapunzel'' (''Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen'' (1856), Vol. III, p. 22.)</ref> Desperate, he agrees. When his wife has a baby girl, the sorceress takes her to raise as her own and names her \"Rapunzel\" after the plant her mother craved. She grows up to be a beautiful child with long golden hair.<ref>In Schulz, this is caused by the fairy herself, who sprinkles the child with a \"precious liquid/perfume/ointment\" ({{lang-de|kostbaren Wasser}}). Her hair according to Schulz is thirty ells long (112 1/2 feet or 34.29 meters), but not at all uncomfortable for her to wear (''Kleine Romane'', p. 277); in the Grimms, it hangs twenty ells (75 feet/22.86 meters) from the window-hook to the ground. (''Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen'' (1857) Vol. I., p. 66.).</ref> When she turns twelve, the sorceress locks her up inside a tower in the middle of the woods, with neither stairs nor a door, and only one room and one window.<ref>In Schulz's 1790 version of the story, the purpose of the fairy in doing so is to protect Rapunzel from an \"unlucky star\" which threatens her (''Kleine Romane'', p. 275); the Grimms (deliberately seeking to return to a more archaic form of the story and perhaps influenced by Basile's Italian variant) make the fairy/sorceress a much more threatening figure.</ref> In order to visit Rapunzel, the sorceress stands beneath the tower and calls out:\n\n:''Rapunzel!''\n:''Rapunzel!''\n:''Let down your hair''\n:''That I may climb thy golden stair!''<ref>Schulz, \"''Rapunzel, la\u00df deine Haare 'runter, da\u00df ich 'rauf kann.''\" ({{lang-de|Rapunzel, let down thy hairs, so I can [climb] up.}}) (''Kleine Romane'', p. 278); Grimms, \"''Rapunzel, Rapunzel, la\u00df dein Haar herunter!'' ({{lang-de|Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let downwards thy hair!}}) (''Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen'' (1857) Vol. I., p. 66.) Jacob Grimm believed that the strong alliteration of the rhyme indicated that it was a survival of the ancient form of Germanic poetry known as \"''[[Stabreim]]''.\"</ref>\n\nOne day, a [[prince]] rides through the forest and hears Rapunzel singing from the tower. Entranced by her ethereal voice, he searches for her and discovers the tower, but is unable to enter it. He returns often, listening to her beautiful singing, and one day sees the sorceress visit and learns how to gain access. When the sorceress leaves, he bids Rapunzel let her hair down. When she does so, he climbs up and they fall in love. He eventually asks her to [[Marriage|marry]] him, which she agrees to. \n\nTogether they plan a means of escape, wherein he will come each night (thus avoiding the sorceress who visits her by day) and bring Rapunzel a piece of [[silk]] that she will gradually weave into a [[rope ladder|ladder]]. Before the plan can come to fruition, however, she foolishly gives him away. In the first edition (1812) of ''Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen'' ({{lang-de|Children's and Household Tales}}, most commonly known in English as ''[[Grimm's Fairy Tales]]''), she innocently says that her dress is growing tighter around her waist, hinting at [[pregnancy]].<ref>This detail is also found in Schulz, ''Kleine Romane'', p. 281.</ref> In later editions, she asks \"Dame Gothel\"<ref>{{lang-de|Frau Gothel}}. Rapunzel refers to the previously unnamed sorceress by this title only at this point in the Grimms' story. The use of ''Frau'' in early modern German was more restricted, and referred only to a woman of noble birth, rather than to any woman as in modern German.  \"''Gothel''\" (or ''G\u00f6thel, G\u00f6thle, G\u00f6the, etc''.) was originally not a personal name, but an occupational one meaning \"[[midwife]], [[wet nurse]], [[foster mother]], [[Godparent]]\" ({{lang-de|Amme, Ammefrau; Taufpate}}). ''Cf.'' Ernst Ludwig Rochholz's ''Deutsche Arbeits-Entw\u00fcrfe'', Vol. II, p. 150. The Grimms' use of this archaic term was another example of their attempt to return the story to a primitive Teutonic form.</ref>, in a moment of forgetfulness, why it is easier for her to draw up the prince than her.<ref name=facts>Maria Tatar (1987) ''The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales'', Princeton University Press, p. 18, {{ISBN|0-691-06722-8}}</ref>  In anger, the sorceress cuts off Rapunzel's hair and casts her out into the wilderness to fend for herself.\n\nWhen the prince calls that night, the sorceress lets the severed hair down to haul him up. To his horror, he finds himself meeting her instead of Rapunzel, who is nowhere to be found. After she tells him in a rage that he will never see Rapunzel again, he leaps or falls from the tower, landing in a thorn bush. Although the thorn bush breaks his fall and saves his life, it scratches his eyes and blinds him.\n\nFor years, he wanders through the wastelands of the country and eventually comes to the wilderness where Rapunzel now lives with the twins to whom she has given birth, a boy and a girl.

Almost a decade later in 1896, the ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company'' was incorporated after being granted a franchise from the Town of Cornwall (later the City of Cornwall) to operate a streetcar service.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~wyatt/alltime/cornwall-on.html|title=Transit History of Cornwall, Ontario|website=home.cc.umanitoba.ca|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>  The service began on July 1, 1896 using four cars traveling on what was approximately three miles of track.  A year later in 1997, two additional cars were purchased.  To generate additional revenues, the company started in 1899 a freight service.  That service would move freight from the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] yards, and from the [[New York and Ottawa Railway]] to the Toronto Paper Company, Canadian Coloured Cottons, and other local businesses, including the town's local post office.\n\nIn 1898, the [[Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada]] became a [[bondholder]] of ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company'' and four years later in 1902, the company which was facing financial difficulties with its freight service operations defaulted on its debt, giving Sun Life full ownership.  In 1905, Sun Life now itself struggling with the railway business, purchased the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' and would amalgamate both companies into a new company called ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited.''  With the combined operations, the company could now provide the distribution of electricity to power its passenger and freight switching service, and distribute that electricity to power lights and heat.  The company would generate additional revenues by providing its customers with hot water by selling hot water heaters which it powered using its electricity paid for by its customers using a [[flat rate]] billing system. The flat rate system was later discontinued and the sale of hot water heaters abandoned.   \n\nIn 1957, the City of Cornwall formed a committee which was appointed to do what would be its first look at purchasing the utility, and it was not until forty years later in 1977, did [[city council]] under the leadership of Mayor Gerald Parisien decide to purchase the company from Sun Life for CA$ 4.8 million.<ref name=\":0\" /> Later that year, the City of Cornwall appointed members to its first board of directors, which were Mayor Gerald Parisien, General Manager Gord Fairweather, Albert Bergeron, Fred Bradley, Neil Burke, and Doug Fawthrop.

During the prolonged ice storm, much of [[Eastern Ontario]] and [[Western Quebec]] was without electricity, including Cornwall.  Although the City of Cornwall straddles the banks of the [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint-Lawrence River]] which supplies water to the neighboring  [[R. H. Saunders Station|R.H. Saunders Power Generating Station]], no electricity ever flowed from it to the city.  Existing wires connecting the power dam to the city were for the first time powered with electricity generated by the local power plant.  There were three wires and all were weighed down and covered with ice.  Two of the three wires were dangerously close to each other, until a Cornwall Electric employee who was also an archer, used a [[bow and arrow]] to throw a line over the arcing wires, allowing workers to bounce the wires, causing the ice to fall off and the lines to separate from each other. For the first and only time in history, this permitted [[Ontario Hydro]] (now [[Ontario Power Generation]]) with its local hydroelectric power generating station, to provide Cornwall Electric and Cornwall residents, with enough power to meet seventy-five percent of its electricity needs during the 1998 ice storm.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Progress Fund ===\nAfter paying off the city's debt with the sale of Cornwall Electric, the City created the Progress Fund with the remaining proceeds and later in 2014, it protected the fund by passing a [[by-law]] equipped with a funding mechanism requiring the fund to always maintain a minimum balance of CA$ 25 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallnewswatch.com/2019/05/07/city-put-25m-progress-fund-in-jeopardy-auditor/|title=City put $25M Progress Fund in jeopardy: auditor \u2013 Cornwall Newswatch|website=www.cornwallnewswatch.com|date=May 7, 2019|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>  Originally, the fund was also setup to only fund quality of life projects in the city of Cornwall.

It is located in the western [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsula]]. The population was 1,851 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].\n\nThe city is situated within [[Wakefield Township, Michigan|Wakefield Township]], but is politically independent. It is on [[U.S. Route 2 in Michigan|U.S. Highway&nbsp;2]] (US&nbsp;2) about {{convert|10|mi|km}} east of [[Ironwood, Michigan|Ironwood]] and the [[Wisconsin]] border. [[M-28 (Michigan highway)|M-28]] has its western terminus in the city.\n\nIt is home to Sunday Lake, [[Indianhead Mountain]] Resort, Gogebic County Medical Care Facility, and Gogebic County Community Mental Health Authority. Once a mining town, the economy is now based upon the forest industry, goods and services, and tourism.\n\n==History==\n\n===Founding===\nGeorge Mix Wakefield,<ref>{{cite book | last = Cox | first = Bruce K. | title = Pioneers of Wakefield Michigan 1884\u20131900 | publisher=Agogeebic Press, LLC | year = 2010 | edition = Fifth | pages = 330\u2013331}}</ref> born born February6,1839,in [[Henderson, New York]], a son of James Patterson Wakefield and Hannah B. Hall, had the town site of Wakefield platted in May 1886; the general location was already being referred to as \"Wakefield\" as early as the fall of 1884. His parents moved their family to [[Waukesha County, Wisconsin]] in October 1844.  Mr. Wakefield became interested in logging and real estate and acquired vast tracts of land in the western [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan]] in the 1870s and 1880s.  Together with various other capitalists he built sawmills and logged the pine forests of the area, and later became involved in mineral exploration.  He was one of the parties who held interests in the mineral rights to the Sunday Lake mine, as well as a few nearby properties.\n\n===George M. Wakefield===\nMr. Wakefield moved to [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] in 1879 and established a real estate business, dealing in timber and mineral lands in [[Michigan]], [[Wisconsin]], Texas, and [[Alaska]].  He was secretary-treasurer of the [[Ontonagon River]] Improvement and Boom Company, organized in 1880.  They made it possible to float logs out to [[Lake Superior]] and built a sawmill on an island near the mouth of the Ontonagon river in [[Ontonagon, Michigan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gogebic.org/history.htm |title=Gogibic County History |publisher=Ggogebic County Government | accessdate=March 3, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe G. M. Wakefield Mineral Land Company was formed in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on September 18, 1899 for the purpose of dealing in mineral lands, timber, agricultural lands, and real estate.  George M. Wakefield, his wife and their son Vernon T. Wakefield were the stockholders with a capital stock of $50,000 divided into 500 shares.  Most of the land held was in Township 47 North, between Wakefield and [[Lake Gogebic]].  Mr. Wakefield was also a major stockholder in the Beacon, Continental, Cosmos, International, and Summit mineral land companies.\n\nThe Wakefield ancestry is traced back to John Wakefield, who was born about 1614, probably in Gravesend, County Kent, England and immigrated to Virginia aboard the \"America\" in June 1635, along with his brothers Richard Wakefield and Thomas Wakefield.  John Wakefield eventually settled at [[Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Massachusetts]].\n\n===Incorporation===\nWakefield was [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] as a village by the Gogebic County Board of Supervisors on November 20, 1887.  It became incorporated as a city in 1919.\n\n[[File:wakefield3.jpg|thumb|250px|Sunday Lake]]\n[[File:Sunday Lake.jpg|thumb|250px|Sunday Lake in Fall]]\n\n===Mining boom===\nThe founding of Wakefield and much of its early history was based upon the discovery of [[iron ore]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,1607,7-153-54463_18670_18793-53100--,00.html | title = The Iron Riches of Michigan's Upper Peninsula | publisher=michigan.gov/dnr/ | accessdate =March 3, 2011}}</ref> on the east end of Sunday Lake by George A. Fay in 1881.  Upon its discovery several mining companies surged to the area and many mines opened.  Many of the cities location names such as Plymouth, Pike, Castile, and Comet got their names from these iron mines.  The first mines in Wakefield were the Sunday Lake, Iron Chief, and the Brotherton.  According to the Gogebic Range Directory of 1888, the output of these mines in 1886 was as follows: Sunday Lake, 13,00 tons; Iron Chief, 9,584 tons, and the Brotherton, about 3,500 tons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gogebic.org/history.htm |title=Gogibic County History |publisher=Ggogebic County Government | accessdate=February 22, 2011}}</ref>\n\nWakefield's iron mines include:<ref>Cox, Headframes and Mine Shafts of the Gogebic Range, Volume 2 (2000)</ref>\n\n* '''MIKADO''' Captain John Lester did pioneering work on the MIKADO in 1886.  Development occurred off and on for several years, until the first ore was shipped in 1895. The mine is credited with shipping over one million tons from 1895 to 1917.  Shipments from 1919 to 1952 were sent under the PLYMOUTH name.  The MIKADO mine was located on the northwest end of the open pit, in Verona location.\n* '''PILGRIM''' Explorations began on this location in the spring of 1886 under Captain Harry Letcher.  Nothing was shipped until 1919\u201327 when the PILGRIM made shipments of twenty-two thousand tons.  The PILGRIM was located just east of the MIKADO.\n* '''PLYMOUTH''' The PLYMOUTH open pit mine operated just to the west of the WAKEFIELD, but the PLYMOUTH was entirely an open pit operation, with the possible exception of a small amount of ore taken out of the No.3 shaft as it was being sunk.  It began shipping in 1916 and closed on November 6, 1952, having shipped almost seventeen million tons.\n* '''WAKEFIELD''' Drill exploration began on the WAKEFIELD property in July 1912, and two shafts were down by the following summer.  The first ore shipment was made on October 15, 1913.  The WAKEFIELD soon became an open pit mine, shipping a total of almost fourteen million gross tons from 1913 to 1954.\n* '''CITY OF CHICAGO''' Exploration began in the latter part of 1886 at this location on the north shore of Sunday lake.  The SPARTA operated on the same location in 1888 and the CITY OF CHICAGO returned in 1896, eventually producing shipments of almost one hundred thousand tons of ore between 1896 and 1915.  It was also called the SOUTH CHICAGO in 1915.\n* '''SPARTA''' The former CITY OF CHICAGO exploration became the SPARTA in 1888.  It was developed and shipped almost ten thousand tons from 1891 to 1895.\n* '''ALPHA''' In the summer of 1886 the Alpha Iron Mining Company sank a shaft near the north shore of Sunday lake.  By 1890 this location was taken over by the PIKE mine.\n* '''PIKE''' Captain Robinson D. Pike (1838\u20131906) of Bayfield, Wisconsin took over the former ALPHA option in 1889.  Ten years later the PIKE made its first shipment, with total shipments of over one hundred five thousand tons from 1899 to 1910.  In 1927 the PIKE became part of the SUNDAY LAKE GROUP.\n* '''BROTHERTON''' Frank H. Brotherton began mineral explorations near Sunday lake in the summer of 1883.  The first iron ore was shipped from the mine in 1886, with total shipments amounting to two million six hundred ninety thousand tons by the time the mine closed in 1923.\n* '''SUNDAY LAKE''' This location was first explored in 1881 by George Fay.  Development picked up by 1884, and the first iron shipment left port at Ashland on November 19, 1885.  The SUNDAY LAKE mine later encompassed all of Section 10 and the former BROTHERTON mine.  Over seventeen million gross tons of ore went out from 1885 to 1961.  The mine closed on February 16, 1961.\n* '''IRON CHIEF''' Development of the IRON CHIEF mine began in 1884 under the Fink Mining Company.  It was originally called the ASCHERMANN for Edward Aschermann (18341904) of Appleton, Wisconsin.  The mine shipped about twelve thousand tons of iron ore in 1886 and 1887.\n* '''CASTILE''' Captain Pentecost Mitchell (1861\u20131933) discovered iron ore on this location in 1886.  The CASTILE began producing in 1906 and shipped almost nine hundred thousand tons of ore by the time it closed in 1923.\n* '''METEOR''' The METEOR started as an exploration in 1890, called the NORTON.  It was developed into a mine by 1900 and operated until 1904, shipping one hundred thirty-two thousand tons between 1899 and 1904. Over six million tons of stockpile ore went under the name NORTH MIKADO.\n* '''COMET''' Captain Pentecost Mitchell found ore here and an exploration called the ECLlPSE was developed from 1886 to 1890.  The COMET began in 1890 making its first ore shipment in August.  The COMET was shut down in 1893 reopening in 1900 and operating until 1902 as part of the METEOR mine.  It is credited with shipments of eighty-nine thousand tons in 1890\u201393.\n* '''MORGAN''' The MORGAN mine east of Wakefield was developed in 1918\u201323 and made its first ore shipment on January 30, 1923.  It operated until 1925 and shipped over fifty-eight thousand tons.\n* '''VICAR''' The easternmost productive mine on the Gogebic Range covered most of Section 12, east of Wakefield.  This location was once called the JONES & LAUGHLIN exploration and included the old PHOENIX exploration that dated back to 1887.  The VICAR shipped about one hundred two thousand tons in 1950\u201351.\n\n==Post-mining era==\n\n[[File:wakefield12.jpg|thumb|250px|View from \"Tank Hill\"]]\n\nAfter the closure of the Sunday Lake Mine<ref name=\"Early History of Wakefield\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gogebicbooks.com/pdf/EarlyHistoryofWakefield.pdf | title=Early History of Wakefield |publisher=gogebicbooks.com | accessdate=February 25, 2011}}</ref> on February 16, 1961, the local economy shifted from one of mining to the forest industry, goods and services and tourism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ref.michigan.org/medc/miinfo/places/GogebicCounty/ | title=Gogebic County Economic Profiler |publisher=michigan.org | accessdate=February 25, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://ref.michigan.org/medc/miinfo/places/GogebicCounty/?section=economy | title = Gogebic County Economy | publisher=michigan.org | accessdate =March 3, 2011}}</ref>\n\nLogging had been a mainstay of the local economy since the early 1900s.

They all support the larger industries of lumber and plywood mills located in Gogebic County and outlying areas.\n\nAfter the local mining jobs were lost, many in the community began providing goods and services, which included restaurants, food markets, bakery, bars, gas stations, hardware stores, drug stores and other commerce that supports the needs of the community.\n\nWith an average of 156\u2013240&nbsp;inches of annual snowfall, the city greatly benefits from winter tourism. Indianhead Mountain opened in 1959 and has grown to become a major tourist magnet in both winter and summer. Snowmobile trails, cross-country skiing trails, and ice fishing on Sunday Lake have also drawn many tourists to the city during the winter months. During the summer, hiking, camping, fishing, and on occasion [[American Power Boat Association]] boat races on Sunday Lake contribute to a growing local tourist industry.  As a typical small town, many are drawn back to participate in the annual old-fashioned [[Independence Day (United States)|July 4]] celebration. The week-long event includes softball tournaments, high school class reunions, homecoming church services, town picnic and concert at Eddy Park, a Sunday Lake run contest, Main Street parade, children's races, and fireworks display over Sunday Lake.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wakefieldtownship.com/Wakefield%204th%20%20Reunion%20Schedule-2008.pdf | title=Old-Fashioned 4th of July Celebration |publisher=City of Wakefield | accessdate=February 25, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==2016 storm==\nSevere storms struck the Gogebic Range during the late evening of July 11, 2016 and the early morning of July 12, 2016. The storm produced flash floods across the area and one confirmed [[Enhanced Fujita Scale|EF0]] tornado in nearby [[Bessemer Township, Michigan|Bessemer Township]]. In particular, the city of Wakefield was struck with a thunderstorm with straight line winds around 90 MPH which downed numerous trees and power lines, turned over a camper trailer, and tore the roof off of a former ice rink along Sunday Lake. Following the storm, parts of the city remained without power for a considerable time before crews could restore power.<ref>{{cite web|title=Little Girls Point, Wakefield take brunt of storm in Gogebic County|url=http://www.yourdailyglobe.com/story/2016/07/13/news/little-girls-point-wakefield-take-brunt-of-storm-in-gogebic-county/6915.html}}</ref>\n\n==Community==\n[[File:2009-0617-CityHall-Wakefield.jpg|thumb|250px|The old Wakefield City Hall at 311 Sunday Lake Street]]\n\n===City Hall===\nThe City Hall is located at 509 Sunday Lake Street (Formerly the Father Daniel Hall).

That fall the old City Hall closed and the City government moved into FDH.  Plans to repair or replace the old City Hall had been discussed for decades. The boilers and some bathrooms were not functioning, the exterior required extensive tuck-pointing and repair, and the building did not meet [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA standards]]. Many of the offices were in need of rewiring and required structural repairs. Many of the other areas were no longer utilized. As conditions deteriorated the cost of keeping the doors open increased year after year.  Conversely, FDH had seen significant improvements. In 2013, the roof was replaced, and the boilers are functioning. All of the rooms are on one floor, and the entrance is handicap accessible, offering access to all residents.

By the late 1950s after the local iron mines closed, the major [[tax base]] was lost and the city no longer had adequate funds to operate the Memorial Building.

The dream for the library dates back to Oct 17, 1934 when a group of local citizens concerned about the literary heritage of their community decided to take action. They felt that a measurement of the cultural concerns of a community could be made through the literary pursuits of its citizens.  The city of Wakefield made its first appropriation of $1,000 to lay the groundwork of the fine community facility we enjoy today.  The Wakefield Public Library serves the City and Township of Wakefield.  With help from the \"Friends of the Library\" it has received some needed renovations.  In 2005, the children's section was totally remodeled followed by the \"teen section\" in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.librarytechnology.org/lwc-displaylibrary.pl?RC=19790/ | title=Wakefield Public Library |publisher=libwebcats | accessdate=February 23, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Public safety===\n*Wakefield [[Volunteer fire department|Volunteer Fire Department]].\n*Gogebic County Sheriff's Department at 100 Iron Street, [[Bessemer, Michigan]].\n*[[Michigan State Police]] Post No.&nbsp;87 at 100 Sunday Lake Street.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.michigan.gov/msp/0,1607,7-123-1584_3474_4758---,00.html | title=Michigan State Police |publisher=Michigan.gov | accessdate=February 23, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Healthcare facilities &  nursing homes===\n*Gogebic County Medical Care Facility at 402 North Street is a 109-bed [[Nursing Home]] facility which provides extended-stay nursing care to seniors with varying levels of disabilities.

It is located in the western [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsula]]. The population was 1,851 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].\n\nThe city is situated within [[Wakefield Township, Michigan|Wakefield Township]], but is politically independent. It is on [[U.S. Route 2 in Michigan|U.S. Highway&nbsp;2]] (US&nbsp;2) about {{convert|10|mi|km}} east of [[Ironwood, Michigan|Ironwood]] and the [[Wisconsin]] border. [[M-28 (Michigan highway)|M-28]] has its western terminus in the city.\n\nIt is home to Sunday Lake, [[Indianhead Mountain]] Resort, Gogebic County Medical Care Facility, and Gogebic County Community Mental Health Authority. Once a mining town, the economy is now based upon the forest industry, goods and services, and tourism.\n\n==History==\n\n===Founding===\nGeorge Mix Wakefield,<ref>{{cite book | last = Cox | first = Bruce K. | title = Pioneers of Wakefield Michigan 1884\u20131900 | publisher=Agogeebic Press, LLC | year = 2010 | edition = Fifth | pages = 330\u2013331}}</ref> born born February6,1839,in [[Henderson, New York]], a son of James Patterson Wakefield and Hannah B. Hall, had the town site of Wakefield platted in May 1886; the general location was already being referred to as \"Wakefield\" as early as the fall of 1884. His parents moved their family to [[Waukesha County, Wisconsin]] in October 1844.  Mr. Wakefield became interested in logging and real estate and acquired vast tracts of land in the western [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan]] in the 1870s and 1880s.  Together with various other capitalists he built sawmills and logged the pine forests of the area, and later became involved in mineral exploration.  He was one of the parties who held interests in the mineral rights to the Sunday Lake mine, as well as a few nearby properties.\n\n===George M. Wakefield===\nMr. Wakefield moved to [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] in 1879 and established a real estate business, dealing in timber and mineral lands in [[Michigan]], [[Wisconsin]], Texas, and [[Alaska]].  He was secretary-treasurer of the [[Ontonagon River]] Improvement and Boom Company, organized in 1880.  They made it possible to float logs out to [[Lake Superior]] and built a sawmill on an island near the mouth of the Ontonagon river in [[Ontonagon, Michigan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gogebic.org/history.htm |title=Gogibic County History |publisher=Ggogebic County Government | accessdate=March 3, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe G. M. Wakefield Mineral Land Company was formed in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on September 18, 1899 for the purpose of dealing in mineral lands, timber, agricultural lands, and real estate.  George M. Wakefield, his wife and their son Vernon T. Wakefield were the stockholders with a capital stock of $50,000 divided into 500 shares.  Most of the land held was in Township 47 North, between Wakefield and [[Lake Gogebic]].  Mr. Wakefield was also a major stockholder in the Beacon, Continental, Cosmos, International, and Summit mineral land companies.\n\nThe Wakefield ancestry is traced back to John Wakefield, who was born about 1614, probably in Gravesend, County Kent, England and immigrated to Virginia aboard the \"America\" in June 1635, along with his brothers Richard Wakefield and Thomas Wakefield.  John Wakefield eventually settled at [[Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Massachusetts]].\n\n===Incorporation===\nWakefield was [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] as a village by the Gogebic County Board of Supervisors on November 20, 1887.  It became incorporated as a city in 1919.\n\n[[File:wakefield3.jpg|thumb|250px|Sunday Lake]]\n[[File:Sunday Lake.jpg|thumb|250px|Sunday Lake in Fall]]\n\n===Mining boom===\nThe founding of Wakefield and much of its early history was based upon the discovery of [[iron ore]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,1607,7-153-54463_18670_18793-53100--,00.html | title = The Iron Riches of Michigan's Upper Peninsula | publisher=michigan.gov/dnr/ | accessdate =March 3, 2011}}</ref> on the east end of Sunday Lake by George A. Fay in 1881.  Upon its discovery several mining companies surged to the area and many mines opened.  Many of the cities location names such as Plymouth, Pike, Castile, and Comet got their names from these iron mines.  The first mines in Wakefield were the Sunday Lake, Iron Chief, and the Brotherton.  According to the Gogebic Range Directory of 1888, the output of these mines in 1886 was as follows: Sunday Lake, 13,00 tons; Iron Chief, 9,584 tons, and the Brotherton, about 3,500 tons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gogebic.org/history.htm |title=Gogibic County History |publisher=Ggogebic County Government | accessdate=February 22, 2011}}</ref>\n\nWakefield's iron mines include:<ref>Cox, Headframes and Mine Shafts of the Gogebic Range, Volume 2 (2000)</ref>\n\n* '''MIKADO''' Captain John Lester did pioneering work on the MIKADO in 1886.  Development occurred off and on for several years, until the first ore was shipped in 1895. The mine is credited with shipping over one million tons from 1895 to 1917.  Shipments from 1919 to 1952 were sent under the PLYMOUTH name.  The MIKADO mine was located on the northwest end of the open pit, in Verona location.\n* '''PILGRIM''' Explorations began on this location in the spring of 1886 under Captain Harry Letcher.  Nothing was shipped until 1919\u201327 when the PILGRIM made shipments of twenty-two thousand tons.  The PILGRIM was located just east of the MIKADO.\n* '''PLYMOUTH''' The PLYMOUTH open pit mine operated just to the west of the WAKEFIELD, but the PLYMOUTH was entirely an open pit operation, with the possible exception of a small amount of ore taken out of the No.3 shaft as it was being sunk.  It began shipping in 1916 and closed on November 6, 1952, having shipped almost seventeen million tons.\n* '''WAKEFIELD''' Drill exploration began on the WAKEFIELD property in July 1912, and two shafts were down by the following summer.  The first ore shipment was made on October 15, 1913.  The WAKEFIELD soon became an open pit mine, shipping a total of almost fourteen million gross tons from 1913 to 1954.\n* '''CITY OF CHICAGO''' Exploration began in the latter part of 1886 at this location on the north shore of Sunday lake.  The SPARTA operated on the same location in 1888 and the CITY OF CHICAGO returned in 1896, eventually producing shipments of almost one hundred thousand tons of ore between 1896 and 1915.  It was also called the SOUTH CHICAGO in 1915.\n* '''SPARTA''' The former CITY OF CHICAGO exploration became the SPARTA in 1888.  It was developed and shipped almost ten thousand tons from 1891 to 1895.\n* '''ALPHA''' In the summer of 1886 the Alpha Iron Mining Company sank a shaft near the north shore of Sunday lake.  By 1890 this location was taken over by the PIKE mine.\n* '''PIKE''' Captain Robinson D. Pike (1838\u20131906) of Bayfield, Wisconsin took over the former ALPHA option in 1889.  Ten years later the PIKE made its first shipment, with total shipments of over one hundred five thousand tons from 1899 to 1910.  In 1927 the PIKE became part of the SUNDAY LAKE GROUP.\n* '''BROTHERTON''' Frank H. Brotherton began mineral explorations near Sunday lake in the summer of 1883.  The first iron ore was shipped from the mine in 1886, with total shipments amounting to two million six hundred ninety thousand tons by the time the mine closed in 1923.\n* '''SUNDAY LAKE''' This location was first explored in 1881 by George Fay.  Development picked up by 1884, and the first iron shipment left port at Ashland on November 19, 1885.  The SUNDAY LAKE mine later encompassed all of Section 10 and the former BROTHERTON mine.  Over seventeen million gross tons of ore went out from 1885 to 1961.  The mine closed on February 16, 1961.\n* '''IRON CHIEF''' Development of the IRON CHIEF mine began in 1884 under the Fink Mining Company.  It was originally called the ASCHERMANN for Edward Aschermann (18341904) of Appleton, Wisconsin.  The mine shipped about twelve thousand tons of iron ore in 1886 and 1887.\n* '''CASTILE''' Captain Pentecost Mitchell (1861\u20131933) discovered iron ore on this location in 1886.  The CASTILE began producing in 1906 and shipped almost nine hundred thousand tons of ore by the time it closed in 1923.\n* '''METEOR''' The METEOR started as an exploration in 1890, called the NORTON.  It was developed into a mine by 1900 and operated until 1904, shipping one hundred thirty-two thousand tons between 1899 and 1904. Over six million tons of stockpile ore went under the name NORTH MIKADO.\n* '''COMET''' Captain Pentecost Mitchell found ore here and an exploration called the ECLlPSE was developed from 1886 to 1890.  The COMET began in 1890 making its first ore shipment in August.  The COMET was shut down in 1893 reopening in 1900 and operating until 1902 as part of the METEOR mine.  It is credited with shipments of eighty-nine thousand tons in 1890\u201393.\n* '''MORGAN''' The MORGAN mine east of Wakefield was developed in 1918\u201323 and made its first ore shipment on January 30, 1923.  It operated until 1925 and shipped over fifty-eight thousand tons.\n* '''VICAR''' The easternmost productive mine on the Gogebic Range covered most of Section 12, east of Wakefield.  This location was once called the JONES & LAUGHLIN exploration and included the old PHOENIX exploration that dated back to 1887.  The VICAR shipped about one hundred two thousand tons in 1950\u201351.\n\n==Post-mining era==\n\n[[File:wakefield12.jpg|thumb|250px|View from \"Tank Hill\"]]\n\nAfter the closure of the Sunday Lake Mine<ref name=\"Early History of Wakefield\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gogebicbooks.com/pdf/EarlyHistoryofWakefield.pdf | title=Early History of Wakefield |publisher=gogebicbooks.com | accessdate=February 25, 2011}}</ref> on February 16, 1961, the local economy shifted from one of mining to the forest industry, goods and services and tourism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ref.michigan.org/medc/miinfo/places/GogebicCounty/ | title=Gogebic County Economic Profiler |publisher=michigan.org | accessdate=February 25, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://ref.michigan.org/medc/miinfo/places/GogebicCounty/?section=economy | title = Gogebic County Economy | publisher=michigan.org | accessdate =March 3, 2011}}</ref>\n\nLogging had been a mainstay of the local economy since the early 1900s. In 1941, the county embarked upon a county forest project to demonstrate that with selective cutting, under proper management, forests could be perpetuated, of increasing value and quality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gogebic.org/herit.htm | title=Our Heritage |publisher=gogebic.org | accessdate=February 25, 2011}}</ref> By 1956, the project included {{convert|45604|acre|km2}} out of the total of {{convert|703102|acre|km2}} in the county and [[Ottawa National Forest]] harvesting marked hardwoods, aspen, and conifer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gogebic.org/adobeforms/gogebicpdf.pdf | title=The Gogebic County Forest System 1943\u20132008 |publisher=gogebic.org | accessdate=February 25, 2011}}</ref> In support of the local lumber industry, many successful lumber, trucking, equipment sales, and logging businesses have existed in Wakefield and many continue to do so today. They all support the larger industries of lumber and plywood mills located in Gogebic County and outlying areas.\n\nAfter the local mining jobs were lost, many in the community began providing goods and services, which included restaurants, food markets, bakery, bars, gas stations, hardware stores, drug stores and other commerce that supports the needs of the community.\n\nWith an average of 156\u2013240&nbsp;inches of annual snowfall, the city greatly benefits from winter tourism. Indianhead Mountain opened in 1959 and has grown to become a major tourist magnet in both winter and summer. Snowmobile trails, cross-country skiing trails, and ice fishing on Sunday Lake have also drawn many tourists to the city during the winter months. During the summer, hiking, camping, fishing, and on occasion [[American Power Boat Association]] boat races on Sunday Lake contribute to a growing local tourist industry.  As a typical small town, many are drawn back to participate in the annual old-fashioned [[Independence Day (United States)|July 4]] celebration. The week-long event includes softball tournaments, high school class reunions, homecoming church services, town picnic and concert at Eddy Park, a Sunday Lake run contest, Main Street parade, children's races, and fireworks display over Sunday Lake.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wakefieldtownship.com/Wakefield%204th%20%20Reunion%20Schedule-2008.pdf | title=Old-Fashioned 4th of July Celebration |publisher=City of Wakefield | accessdate=February 25, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==2016 storm==\nSevere storms struck the Gogebic Range during the late evening of July 11, 2016 and the early morning of July 12, 2016. The storm produced flash floods across the area and one confirmed [[Enhanced Fujita Scale|EF0]] tornado in nearby [[Bessemer Township, Michigan|Bessemer Township]]. In particular, the city of Wakefield was struck with a thunderstorm with straight line winds around 90 MPH which downed numerous trees and power lines, turned over a camper trailer, and tore the roof off of a former ice rink along Sunday Lake. Following the storm, parts of the city remained without power for a considerable time before crews could restore power.<ref>{{cite web|title=Little Girls Point, Wakefield take brunt of storm in Gogebic County|url=http://www.yourdailyglobe.com/story/2016/07/13/news/little-girls-point-wakefield-take-brunt-of-storm-in-gogebic-county/6915.html}}</ref>\n\n==Community==\n[[File:2009-0617-CityHall-Wakefield.jpg|thumb|250px|The old Wakefield City Hall at 311 Sunday Lake Street]]\n\n===City Hall===\nThe City Hall is located at 509 Sunday Lake Street (Formerly the Father Daniel Hall).

That fall the old City Hall closed and the City government moved into FDH.  Plans to repair or replace the old City Hall had been discussed for decades. The boilers and some bathrooms were not functioning, the exterior required extensive tuck-pointing and repair, and the building did not meet [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA standards]]. Many of the offices were in need of rewiring and required structural repairs. Many of the other areas were no longer utilized. As conditions deteriorated the cost of keeping the doors open increased year after year.  Conversely, FDH had seen significant improvements. In 2013, the roof was replaced, and the boilers are functioning. All of the rooms are on one floor, and the entrance is handicap accessible, offering access to all residents.

At a cost of $400,000 it was dedicated to the youth who fought in World War I.  It housed a banquet area, meeting rooms, an [[olympic size swimming pool]], and a 1,200 seat movie theater with main floor and balcony seating.  By the late 1950s after the local iron mines closed, the major [[tax base]] was lost and the city no longer had adequate funds to operate the Memorial Building.  During the ensuing decades, other entities owned the building but little was done to sustain it.  The [[Winter storm|harsh winters]] soon destroyed the roof and the building was soon structurally unsound and in a dilapidated state.\n\nIn July 2004, Marvin Suomi, a 1965 graduate of Wakefield High School purchased the Wakefield Memorial Building.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wakefieldmemorialbuildingfoundation.com/index.htm | title=The Wakefield Memorial Building Foundation |publisher=Myefski Architechs, Inc. | accessdate=February 23, 2011}}</ref>  Headed by Mr. Suomi, the Wakefield Memorial Building Foundation was established as a [[501(c)(3) organization]] with the goal of constructing a new, smaller, energy efficient/sustainable building.<ref>{{Cite news| last=Juno |first=Jason |date=July 13, 2008 |title=Wakefield Memorial Building could impact area economy |newspaper=Ironwood Daily Globe |url=http://yourdailyglobe.com/main.asp?search=1&ArticleID=13249&SectionID=1&SubSectionID=&S=1}}</ref>  Federal and state funding were dependent upon a series of environmental reviews and assessments by both the [[U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]] and the [[Michigan State Historic Preservation Office|Michigan State Housing Development Authority]].<ref>{{Cite news| date=October 7, 2008 |title=Memorial Building project on hold until spring |newspaper=Ironwood Daily Globe |url=http://yourdailyglobe.com/main.asp?Search=1&ArticleID=22916&SectionID=1&SubSectionID=&S=1}}</ref>  The State Historic Preservation Office did not want the old building torn down<ref>{{Cite news| last=Levra |first=Margaret |date=February 6, 2009 |title=Historic hurdle |newspaper=Ironwood Daily Globe |url=http://yourdailyglobe.com/main.asp?Search=1&ArticleID=29827&SectionID=1&SubSectionID=&S=1}}</ref>  but after lengthy negotiations a consensus was reached by the project coordinator<ref>{{Cite news| date=December 21, 2009 |title=Wakefield Memorial Building may be razed |newspaper=Ironwood Daily Globe |url=http://yourdailyglobe.com/main.asp?Search=1&ArticleID=37939&SectionID=1&SubSectionID=&S=1}}</ref> and shortly thereafter the City Council approved the [[demolition]].<ref>{{Cite news| date=December 29, 2009 |title=Wakefield moves closer to landmark demolition |newspaper=Ironwood Daily Globe |url=http://yourdailyglobe.com/main.asp?Search=1&ArticleID=38017&SectionID=1&SubSectionID=&S=1}}</ref>  By late spring 2010 the Michigan State Historic Preservation Office approved the archival records compiled of the memorial building and Wakefield City Hall.

The dream for the library dates back to Oct 17, 1934 when a group of local citizens concerned about the literary heritage of their community decided to take action. They felt that a measurement of the cultural concerns of a community could be made through the literary pursuits of its citizens.  The city of Wakefield made its first appropriation of $1,000 to lay the groundwork of the fine community facility we enjoy today.  The Wakefield Public Library serves the City and Township of Wakefield.  With help from the \"Friends of the Library\" it has received some needed renovations.

It consists of steps in the ''front end'', which are the preparation of the fuel, steps in the ''service period'' in which the fuel is used during reactor operation, and steps in the ''back end'', which are necessary to safely manage, contain, and either [[nuclear reprocessing|reprocess]] or dispose of [[used nuclear fuel|spent nuclear fuel]]. If spent fuel is not reprocessed, the fuel cycle is referred to as an ''open fuel cycle'' (or a ''once-through fuel cycle''); if the spent fuel is reprocessed, it is referred to as a ''closed fuel cycle''.\n\n==Basic concepts==\n\n[[Nuclear power]] relies on fissionable material that can sustain a [[nuclear chain reaction|chain reaction]] with [[neutron]]s. Examples of such materials include [[uranium]] and [[plutonium]]. Most nuclear reactors use a [[Neutron moderator|moderator]] to lower the [[kinetic energy]] of the neutrons and increase the probability that [[Nuclear fission|fission]] will occur. This allows reactors to use material with far lower concentration of [[fissile]] [[isotopes]] than are needed for [[nuclear weapon]]s.  [[Graphite]] and [[heavy water]] are the most effective moderators, because they slow the neutrons through collisions without absorbing them. [[Nuclear reactor technology|Reactors]] using [[Heavy water reactor|heavy water]] or graphite as the moderator can operate using [[natural uranium]].\n\nA [[light water reactor]] (LWR) uses water in the form that occurs in nature, and requires fuel enriched to higher concentrations of fissile isotopes. Typically, LWRs use uranium [[Enriched uranium|enriched]] to 3\u20135% [[U-235]], the only fissile isotope that is found in significant quantity in nature. One alternative to this low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel is [[MOX fuel|mixed oxide]] (MOX) fuel produced by blending plutonium with natural or depleted uranium, and these fuels provide an avenue to utilize surplus [[weapons-grade]] plutonium. Another type of MOX fuel involves mixing LEU with [[Thorium fuel cycle|thorium]], which generates the fissile isotope [[Uranium-233|U-233]]. Both plutonium and U-233 are produced from the absorption of neutrons by [[irradiating]] [[fertile material]]s in a reactor, in particular the common uranium isotope [[Uranium-238|U-238]] and [[thorium]], respectively, and can be separated from spent uranium and thorium fuels in [[Nuclear reprocessing|reprocessing plants]].\n\nSome reactors do not use moderators to slow the neutrons. Like nuclear weapons, which also use unmoderated or \"fast\" neutrons, these [[fast-neutron reactor]]s require much higher concentrations of fissile isotopes in order to sustain a chain reaction. They are also capable of [[Breeder reactor|breeding]] fissile isotopes from fertile materials; a [[breeder reactor]] is one that generates more fissile material in this way than it consumes.\n\nDuring the nuclear reaction inside a reactor, the fissile isotopes in nuclear fuel are consumed, producing more and more [[Nuclear fission product|fission products]], most of which are considered [[radioactive waste]]. The buildup of fission products and consumption of fissile isotopes eventually stop the nuclear reaction, causing the fuel to become a [[spent nuclear fuel]]. When 3% enriched LEU fuel is used, the spent fuel typically consists of roughly 1% U-235, 95% U-238, 1% plutonium and 3% fission products. Spent fuel and other high-level radioactive waste is extremely hazardous, although nuclear reactors produce orders of magnitude smaller volumes of waste compared to other power plants because of the high energy density of nuclear fuel. Safe management of these byproducts of nuclear power, including their storage and disposal, is a difficult problem for any country using nuclear power{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}.\n\n==Front end==\n<gallery>\nImage:Uranium ore square.jpg|'''1 [[Uranium ore]]''' \u2013 the principal raw material of nuclear fuel\nImage:Yellowcake.jpg|'''2 [[Yellowcake]]''' \u2013 the form in which uranium is transported to a conversion plant\nImage:UF6 square.jpg|'''3 [[Uranium hexafluoride|UF<sub>6</sub>]]''' \u2013 used in enrichment\nImage:Nuclear fuel pellets.jpeg|'''4 [[Nuclear fuel]]''' \u2013 a compact, inert, insoluble solid\n</gallery>\n\n===Exploration===\nA deposit of uranium, such as [[uraninite]], discovered by geophysical techniques, is evaluated and sampled to determine the amounts of uranium materials that are extractable at specified costs from the deposit. Uranium reserves are the amounts of ore that are estimated to be recoverable at stated costs.\n\nNaturally occurring uranium consists primarily of two isotopes U-238 and U-235, with 99.28% of the metal being U-238 while 0.71% is U-235, and the remaining 0.01% is mostly U-234. The number in such names refers to the [[isotope]]'s atomic [[mass number]], which is the number of [[proton]]s plus the number of [[neutron]]s in the [[atomic nucleus]].\n\nThe atomic nucleus of U-235 will nearly always fission when struck by a [[free neutron]], and the isotope is therefore said to be a \"[[fissile]]\" isotope. The nucleus of a U-238 atom on the other hand, rather than undergoing fission when struck by a free neutron, will nearly always absorb the neutron and yield an atom of the isotope U-239. This isotope then undergoes natural radioactive decay to yield Pu-239, which, like U-235, is a fissile isotope. The atoms of U-238 are said to be fertile, because, through neutron irradiation in the core, some eventually yield atoms of fissile Pu-239.\n\n===Mining===\n{{Main|Uranium mining}}\nUranium ore can be extracted through conventional mining in open pit and underground methods similar to those used for mining other metals. [[In-situ leach]] [[mining]] methods also are used to mine uranium in the [[United States]]. In this technology, uranium is leached from the in-place ore through an array of regularly spaced wells and is then recovered from the leach solution at a surface plant. Uranium ores in the United States typically range from about 0.05 to 0.3% uranium oxide (U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>). Some uranium deposits developed in other countries are of higher grade and are also larger than deposits mined in the United States. Uranium is also present in very low-grade amounts (50 to 200 parts per million) in some domestic [[phosphate]]-bearing deposits of marine origin. Because very large quantities of phosphate-bearing rock are mined for the production of wet-process [[phosphoric acid]] used in high analysis [[fertilizer]]s and other phosphate chemicals, at some phosphate processing plants the uranium, although present in very low concentrations, can be economically recovered from the process stream.\n\n===Milling===\nMined uranium ores normally are processed by [[Grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]] the ore materials to a uniform particle size and then treating the ore to extract the uranium by chemical leaching. The milling process commonly yields dry powder-form material consisting of natural uranium, \"[[yellowcake]]\", which is sold on the uranium market as U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>. Note that the material isn't always yellow.\n\n===Uranium conversion===\nUsually milled uranium oxide, U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub> ([[triuranium octoxide]]) is then processed into either of two substances depending on the intended use.\n\nFor use in most reactors, U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub> is usually converted to [[uranium hexafluoride]] (UF<sub>6</sub>), the input stock for most commercial uranium enrichment facilities. A solid at room temperature, uranium hexafluoride becomes gaseous at 57&nbsp;\u00b0C (134&nbsp;\u00b0F). At this stage of the cycle, the uranium hexafluoride conversion product still has the natural isotopic mix (99.28% of U-238 plus 0.71% of U-235).\n\nFor use in reactors such as [[CANDU]] which do not require enriched fuel, the U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub> may instead be converted to [[uranium dioxide]] (UO<sub>2</sub>) which can be included in [[ceramic]] fuel elements.\n\nIn the current nuclear industry, the volume of material converted directly to UO<sub>2</sub> is typically quite small compared to that converted to UF<sub>6</sub>.\n\n===Enrichment===<!-- This section is linked from [[Nuclear proliferation]] -->\n{{Main|Enriched uranium}}\n[[Image:Nuclear Fuel Cycle.png|330px|thumb|'''Nuclear fuel cycle''' begins when uranium is mined, enriched and manufactured to nuclear fuel (1) which is delivered to a nuclear power plant. After usage in the power plant the spent fuel is delivered to a reprocessing plant (if fuel is recycled) (2) or to a final repository (if no recycling is done) (3) for geological disposition. In [[nuclear reprocessing|reprocessing]] 95% of spent fuel can be recycled to be returned to usage in a nuclear power plant (4).]]\n\nThe natural concentration (0.71%) of the fissionable isotope U-235 is less than that required to sustain a nuclear chain reaction in [[light water reactor]] cores.  Accordingly UF<sub>6</sub> produced from natural uranium sources must be enriched to a higher concentration of the fissionable isotope before being used as nuclear fuel in such reactors. The level of enrichment for a particular nuclear fuel order is specified by the customer according to the application they will use it for: light-water reactor fuel normally is enriched to 3.5% U-235, but uranium enriched to lower concentrations is also required. Enrichment is accomplished using any of several methods of [[isotope separation]]. [[Gaseous diffusion]] and [[gas centrifuge]] are the commonly used uranium enrichment methods, but new enrichment technologies are currently being developed.\n\nThe bulk (96%) of the byproduct from enrichment is [[depleted uranium]] (DU), which can be used for [[armor]], [[kinetic energy penetrator]]s, [[radiation shielding]] and [[Sailing ballast|ballast]]. As of 2008 there are vast quantities of depleted uranium in storage. The [[United States Department of Energy]] alone has 470,000 [[tonne]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://web.ead.anl.gov/uranium/faq/storage/faq16.cfm |title= How much depleted uranium hexafluoride is stored in the United States? |work= Depleted UF6 Management Information Network |accessdate= 2008-01-15}}</ref> About 95% of depleted uranium is stored as [[uranium hexafluoride]] (UF<sub>6</sub>).\n\n===Fabrication===\n{{Main|Nuclear fuel}}\nFor use as nuclear fuel, enriched uranium hexafluoride is converted into [[uranium dioxide]] (UO<sub>2</sub>) powder that is then processed into pellet form. The pellets are then fired in a high temperature [[sintering]] [[furnace]] to create hard, [[ceramic]] pellets of [[enriched uranium]]. The cylindrical pellets then undergo a grinding process to achieve a uniform pellet size. The pellets are stacked, according to each [[nuclear reactor core]]'s design specifications, into tubes of corrosion-resistant metal [[alloy]]. The tubes are sealed to contain the fuel pellets: these tubes are called fuel rods. The finished fuel rods are grouped in special fuel assemblies that are then used to build up the nuclear fuel core of a power reactor.\n\nThe alloy used for the tubes depends on the design of the reactor. [[Stainless steel]] was used in the past, but most reactors now use a [[zirconium alloy]]. For the most common types of reactors, [[boiling water reactor]]s (BWR) and [[pressurized water reactor]]s (PWR), the tubes are assembled into bundles<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.pplweb.com/NR/rdonlyres/F63D7386-A57E-46C6-90A5-857D513B0254/0/seic_plantguide.pdf |title= Susquehanna Nuclear Energy Guide |publisher= PPL Corporation |accessdate= 2008-01-15 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071129121008/http://www.pplweb.com/NR/rdonlyres/F63D7386-A57E-46C6-90A5-857D513B0254/0/seic_plantguide.pdf |archivedate= 2007-11-29 }}</ref> with the tubes spaced precise distances apart. These bundles are then given a unique identification number, which enables them to be tracked from manufacture through use and into disposal.\n\n==Service period==\n\n===Transport of radioactive materials===\n[[Transport]] is an integral part of the nuclear fuel cycle. There are nuclear power reactors in operation in several countries but uranium mining is viable in only a few areas. Also, in the course of over forty years of operation by the nuclear industry, a number of specialized facilities have been developed in various locations around the world to provide fuel cycle services and there is a need to transport nuclear materials to and from these facilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wnti.co.uk/media-centre/nuclear-fuel-cycle.aspx |title=Nuclear Fuel Cycle &#124; World Nuclear Transport Institute |publisher=Wnti.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-04-20}}</ref> Most transports of [[nuclear fuel]] material occur between different stages of the cycle, but occasionally a material may be transported between similar facilities. With some exceptions, nuclear fuel cycle materials are transported in solid form, the exception being [[uranium hexafluoride]] (UF<sub>6</sub>) which is considered a gas. Most of the material used in nuclear fuel is transported several times during the cycle. Transports are frequently international, and are often over large distances. Nuclear materials are generally transported by specialized transport companies.\n\nSince nuclear materials are [[radioactive]], it is important to ensure that radiation exposure of those involved in the transport of such materials and of the general public along transport routes is limited. Packaging for nuclear materials includes, where appropriate, [[radiation shielding|shielding]] to reduce potential radiation exposures. In the case of some materials, such as fresh uranium fuel assemblies, the radiation levels are negligible and no shielding is required. Other materials, such as spent fuel and high-level waste, are highly radioactive and require special handling. To limit the risk in transporting highly radioactive materials, containers known as [[spent nuclear fuel shipping cask]]s are used which are designed to maintain integrity under normal transportation conditions and during hypothetical accident conditions.\n\n===In-core fuel management===\nA [[nuclear reactor core]] is composed of a few hundred \"assemblies\", arranged in a regular array of cells, each cell being formed by a fuel or control rod surrounded, in most designs, by a [[neutron moderator|moderator]] and [[coolant]], which is water in most reactors.\n\nBecause of the [[nuclear fission|fission]] process that consumes the fuels, the old fuel rods must be replaced periodically with fresh ones (this is called a (replacement) cycle). During a given replacement cycle only some of the assemblies (typically one-third) are replaced since fuel depletion occurs at different rates at different places within the reactor core. Furthermore, for efficiency reasons, it is not a good policy to put the new assemblies exactly at the location of the removed ones. Even bundles of the same age will have different burn-up levels due to their previous positions in the core. Thus the available bundles must be arranged in such a way that the yield is maximized, while safety limitations and operational constraints are satisfied. Consequently, reactor operators are faced with the so-called '''optimal fuel reloading problem''', which consists of optimizing the rearrangement of all the assemblies, the old and fresh ones, while still maximizing the reactivity of the reactor core so as to maximise fuel burn-up and minimise fuel-cycle costs.\n\nThis is a [[discrete optimization]] problem, and computationally infeasible by current [[combinatorial]] methods, due to the huge number of [[permutation]]s and the complexity of each computation. Many [[numerical method]]s have been proposed for solving it and many commercial [[software]] packages have been written to support fuel management. This is an ongoing issue in reactor operations as no definitive solution to this problem has been found. Operators use a combination of [[computation]]al and [[empirical]] techniques to manage this problem.\n\n====The study of used fuel====\n{{Main|Post irradiation examination}}\nUsed nuclear fuel is studied in [[Post irradiation examination]], where used fuel is examined to know more about the processes that occur in fuel during use, and how these might alter the outcome of an accident. For example, during normal use, the fuel expands due to thermal expansion, which can cause cracking. Most [[nuclear fuel]] is uranium dioxide, which is a [[Cubic crystal system|cubic]] solid with a structure similar to that of [[calcium fluoride]]. In used fuel the solid state structure of most of the solid remains the same as that of pure cubic uranium dioxide. SIMFUEL is the name given to the simulated spent fuel which is made by mixing finely ground metal oxides, grinding as a slurry, spray drying it before heating in hydrogen/argon to 1700 <sup>o</sup>C.<ref>A good report on the microstructure of used fuel is Lucuta PG ''et al.'' (1991) ''J Nuclear Materials'' '''178''':48-60</ref> In SIMFUEL, 4.1% of the volume of the solid was in the form of metal [[nanoparticle]]s which are made of [[molybdenum]], [[ruthenium]], [[rhodium]] and [[palladium]]. Most of these metal particles are of the \u03b5 phase ([[Hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal]]) of Mo-Ru-Rh-Pd alloy, while smaller amounts of the \u03b1 ([[Cubic crystal system|cubic]]) and \u03c3 ([[Tetragonal crystal system|tetragonal]]) phases of these metals were found in the SIMFUEL. Also present within the SIMFUEL was a cubic [[perovskite]] phase which is a [[barium]] [[strontium]] [[zirconium|zirconate]] (Ba<sub>x</sub>Sr<sub>1\u2212x</sub>ZrO<sub>3</sub>).\n\n[[Image:UO2lattice.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The solid state structure of uranium dioxide, the oxygen atoms are in green and the uranium atoms in red]]\n\nUranium dioxide is very insoluble in water, but after oxidation it can be converted to uranium trioxide or another uranium(VI) compound which is much more soluble. Uranium dioxide (UO<sub>2</sub>) can be oxidised to an oxygen rich hyperstoichiometric oxide (UO<sub>2+x</sub>) which can be further oxidised to U<sub>4</sub>O<sub>9</sub>, U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub> and UO<sub>3</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O.\n\nBecause used fuel contains alpha emitters (plutonium and the [[minor actinides]]), the effect of adding an alpha emitter (<sup>238</sup>Pu) to uranium dioxide on the leaching rate of the oxide has been investigated. For the crushed oxide, adding <sup>238</sup>Pu tended to increase the rate of leaching, but the difference in the leaching rate between 0.1 and 10% <sup>238</sup>Pu was very small.<ref>V.V. Rondinella VV ''et al.'' (2000) ''Radiochimica Acta'' '''88''':527\u2013531</ref>\n\nThe concentration of [[carbonate]] in the water which is in contact with the used fuel has a considerable effect on the rate of corrosion, because [[uranium]](VI) forms soluble anionic carbonate complexes such as [UO<sub>2</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2\u2212</sup> and [UO<sub>2</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>4\u2212</sup>. When carbonate ions are absent, and the water is not strongly acidic, the hexavalent uranium compounds which form on oxidation of [[uranium dioxide]] often form insoluble hydrated [[uranium trioxide]] phases.<ref>For a review of the corrosion of uranium dioxide in a waste store which explains much of the chemistry, see Shoesmith DW (2000) ''J Nuclear Materials'' '''282''':1\u201331</ref>\n\nThin films of uranium dioxide can be deposited upon gold surfaces by \u2018[[sputtering]]\u2019 using uranium metal and an [[argon]]/[[oxygen]] gas mixture. These gold surfaces modified with uranium dioxide have been used for both [[cyclic voltammetry]] and [[AC impedance]] experiments, and these offer an insight into the likely leaching behaviour of uranium dioxide.<ref>Miserque F ''et al.'' (2001) ''J Nuclear Materials'' '''298''':280\u2013290</ref>\n\n====Fuel cladding interactions====\nThe study of the nuclear fuel cycle includes the study of the behaviour of nuclear materials both under normal conditions and under accident conditions. For example, there has been much work on how [[uranium dioxide]] based fuel interacts with the [[zirconium]] alloy tubing used to cover it. During use, the fuel swells due to [[thermal expansion]] and then starts to react with the surface of the zirconium alloy, forming a new layer which contains both fuel and zirconium (from the cladding). Then, on the fuel side of this mixed layer, there is a layer of fuel which has a higher [[caesium]] to [[uranium]] ratio than most of the fuel. This is because [[xenon]] isotopes are formed as [[fission products]] that diffuse out of the lattice of the fuel into voids such as the narrow gap between the fuel and the cladding. After diffusing into these voids, it decays to caesium isotopes. Because of the thermal gradient which exists in the fuel during use, the volatile fission products tend to be driven from the centre of the pellet to the rim area.<ref>Further reading on fuel cladding interactions: Tanaka K ''et al.'' (2006) ''J Nuclear Materials'' '''357''':58\u201368</ref> Below is a graph of the temperature of uranium metal, uranium nitride and [[uranium dioxide]] as a function of distance from the centre of a 20&nbsp;mm diameter pellet with a rim temperature of 200 <sup>o</sup>C. The uranium dioxide (because of its poor thermal conductivity) will overheat at the centre of the pellet, while the other more thermally conductive forms of uranium remain below their melting points.\n\n[[File:Rim200pd1000rad1000fueltemp.png|center|thumb|450px|Temperature profile for a 20&nbsp;mm diameter fuel pellet with a power density of 1 kW per cubic meter. The fuels other than uranium dioxide are not compromised.]]\n\n====Normal and abnormal conditions====\n\nThe nuclear chemistry associated with the nuclear fuel cycle can be divided into two main areas; one area is concerned with operation under the intended conditions while the other area is concerned with maloperation conditions where some alteration from the normal operating conditions has occurred or (''more rarely'') an accident is occurring.\n\nThe releases of radioactivity from normal operations are the small planned releases from uranium ore processing, enrichment, power reactors, reprocessing plants and waste stores. These can be in different chemical/physical form from releases which could occur under accident conditions. In addition the isotope signature of a hypothetical accident may be very different from that of a planned normal operational discharge of radioactivity to the environment.\n\nJust because a radioisotope is released it does not mean it will enter a human and then cause harm. For instance, the migration of radioactivity can be altered by the binding of the radioisotope to the surfaces of soil particles. For example, [[caesium]] (Cs) binds tightly to clay minerals such as [[illite]] and [[montmorillonite]], hence it remains in the upper layers of soil where it can be accessed by plants with shallow roots (such as grass). Hence grass and mushrooms can carry a considerable amount of <sup>137</sup>Cs which can be transferred to humans through the food chain. But <sup>137</sup>Cs is not able to migrate quickly through most soils and thus is unlikely to contaminate [[Water well|well]] water. Colloids of soil minerals can migrate through soil so simple binding of a metal to the surfaces of soil particles does not completely fix the metal.\n\nAccording to Ji\u0159\u00ed H\u00e1la's [[text book]], the distribution coefficient K<sub>d</sub> is the ratio of the soil's radioactivity (Bq g<sup>\u22121</sup>) to that of the soil water (Bq ml<sup>\u22121</sup>). If the radioisotope is tightly bound to the minerals in the soil, then less radioactivity can be absorbed by crops and [[grass]] growing on the soil.\n\n* [[Cs-137]] K<sub>d</sub> = 1000\n* [[plutonium|Pu-239]] K<sub>d</sub> = 10000 to 100000\n* [[strontium|Sr-90]] K<sub>d</sub> = 80 to 150\n* [[Iodine|I-131]] K<sub>d</sub> = 0.007 to 50\n\nIn dairy farming, one of the best countermeasures against <sup>137</sup>Cs is to mix up the soil by deeply ploughing the soil. This has the effect of putting the <sup>137</sup>Cs out of reach of the shallow roots of the grass, hence the level of radioactivity in the grass will be lowered. Also after a nuclear war or serious accident, the removal of top few cm of soil and its burial in a shallow trench will reduce the long-term gamma dose to humans due to <sup>137</sup>Cs, as the gamma photons will be attenuated by their passage through the soil.\n\nEven after the radioactive element arrives at the roots of the plant, the metal may be rejected by the biochemistry of the plant. The details of the uptake of <sup>90</sup>Sr and <sup>137</sup>Cs into [[sunflower]]s grown under [[hydroponic]] conditions has been reported.<ref>P. Soudek, \u0160. Valenov\u00e1, Z. Vav\u0159\u00edkov\u00e1 and T. Van\u011bk, ''Journal of Environmental Radioactivity'', 2006, '''88''', 236\u2013250</ref> The caesium was found in the leaf veins, in the stem and in the [[Apical meristem|apical]] leaves. It was found that 12% of the caesium entered the plant, and 20% of the strontium. This paper also reports details of the effect of [[potassium]], [[ammonium]] and [[calcium]] ions on the uptake of the radioisotopes.\n\nIn [[livestock]] farming, an important countermeasure against <sup>137</sup>Cs is to feed animals a small amount of [[Prussian blue]]. This [[iron]] potassium [[cyanide]] compound acts as an [[ion-exchanger]]. The cyanide is so tightly bonded to the iron that it is safe for a human to eat several grams of Prussian blue per day. The Prussian blue reduces the [[biological half-life]] (different from the [[half-life|nuclear half-life]]) of the caesium. The physical or nuclear half-life of <sup>137</sup>Cs is about 30 years. This is a constant which can not be changed but the biological half-life is not a constant. It will change according to the nature and habits of the organism for which it is expressed. Caesium in humans normally has a biological half-life of between one and four months. An added advantage of the Prussian blue is that the caesium which is stripped from the animal in the [[feces|droppings]] is in a form which is not available to plants. Hence it prevents the caesium from being recycled. The form of Prussian blue required for the treatment of humans or animals is a special grade. Attempts to use the [[pigment]] grade used in [[paint]]s have not been successful. Note that a good{{According to whom|date=July 2012}} source of data on the subject of caesium in [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] fallout exists at [http://www.uiar.org.ua/Eng/index.htm] (''Ukrainian Research Institute for Agricultural Radiology'').\n\n====Release of radioactivity from fuel during normal use and accidents====\n\nThe IAEA assume that under normal operation the coolant of a water-cooled reactor will contain some radioactivity<ref>Generic Assessment Procedures for Determining Protective Actions During a Reactor Accident, IAEA-TECDOC-955, 1997, p. 169</ref> but during a reactor accident the coolant radioactivity level may rise. The IAEA states that under a series of different conditions different amounts of the core inventory can be released from the fuel, the four conditions the IAEA consider are ''normal operation'', a spike in coolant activity due to a sudden shutdown/loss of pressure (core remains covered with water), a cladding failure resulting in the release of the activity in the fuel/cladding gap (this could be due to the fuel being uncovered by the loss of water for 15\u201330 minutes where the cladding reached a temperature of 650\u20131250 <sup>o</sup>C) or a melting of the core (the fuel will have to be uncovered for at least 30 minutes, and the cladding would reach a temperature in excess of 1650 <sup>o</sup>C).<ref>Generic Assessment Procedures for Determining Protective Actions During a Reactor Accident, IAEA-TECDOC-955, 1997, p. 173</ref>\n\nBased upon the assumption that a Pressurized water reactor contains 300 tons of [[water]], and that the activity of the fuel of a 1 GWe reactor is as the IAEA predicts,<ref>Generic Assessment Procedures for Determining Protective Actions During a Reactor Accident, IAEA-TECDOC-955, 1997, p. 171</ref> then the coolant activity after an accident such as the [[Three Mile Island accident]] (where a core is uncovered and then recovered with water) can be predicted.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n=====Releases from reprocessing under normal conditions=====\n\nIt is normal to allow used fuel to stand after the irradiation to allow the short-lived and radiotoxic [[iodine]] isotopes to decay away. In one experiment in the US, fresh fuel which had not been allowed to decay was reprocessed (the [[Green run]] [http://www.osti.gov/energycitations/product.biblio.jsp?osti_id=7296321] [https://web.archive.org/web/20060508030806/http://archive.tri-cityherald.com/thyroid/history.html]) to investigate the effects of a large iodine release from the reprocessing of short cooled fuel. It is normal in reprocessing plants to scrub the off gases from the dissolver to prevent the emission of iodine. In addition to the emission of iodine the [[noble gas]]es and [[tritium]] are released from the fuel when it is dissolved. It has been proposed that by voloxidation (heating the fuel in a furnace under oxidizing conditions) the majority of the tritium can be recovered from the fuel.[https://web.archive.org/web/20060307211536/http://www.ornl.gov/~webworks/cppr/y2001/pres/123514.pdf]\n\nA paper was written on the radioactivity in [[oyster]]s found in the [[Irish Sea]].<ref>A. Preston, J.W.R. Dutton and B.R. Harvey, ''Nature'', 1968, '''218''', 689\u2013690.</ref> These were found by gamma spectroscopy to contain <sup>141</sup>Ce, <sup>144</sup>Ce, <sup>103</sup>Ru, <sup>106</sup>Ru, <sup>137</sup>Cs, <sup>95</sup>Zr and <sup>95</sup>Nb. Additionally, a zinc activation product (<sup>65</sup>Zn) was found, which is thought to be due to the corrosion of [[magnox]] fuel cladding in [[spent fuel pool]]s. It is likely that the modern releases of all these isotopes from the [[Sellafield|Windscale]] event is smaller.\n\n===On-load reactors===\nSome reactor designs, such as [[RBMK]]s or [[CANDU reactor]]s, can be refueled without being shut down. This is achieved through the use of many small pressure tubes to contain the fuel and coolant, as opposed to one large pressure vessel as in [[pressurized water reactor]] (PWR) or [[boiling water reactor]] (BWR) designs. Each tube can be individually isolated and refueled by an operator-controlled fueling machine, typically at a rate of up to 8 channels per day out of roughly 400 in CANDU reactors. On-load refueling allows for the '''optimal fuel reloading problem''' to be dealt with continuously, leading to more efficient use of fuel. This increase in efficiency is partially offset by the added complexity of having hundreds of pressure tubes and the fueling machines to service them.\n\n===Interim storage===\nAfter its operating cycle, the reactor is shut down for refueling. The fuel discharged at that time (spent fuel) is stored either at the reactor site (commonly in a [[spent fuel pool]]) or potentially in a common facility away from reactor sites. If on-site pool storage capacity is exceeded, it may be desirable to store the now cooled aged fuel in modular dry storage facilities known as Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installations (ISFSI) at the reactor site or at a facility away from the site. The spent fuel rods are usually stored in water or boric acid, which provides both cooling (the spent fuel continues to generate [[decay heat]] as a result of residual radioactive decay) and shielding to protect the environment from residual [[ionizing radiation]], although after at least a year of cooling they may be moved to [[dry cask storage]].\n\n===Transportation===\n{{Main|Spent nuclear fuel shipping cask}}\n\n===Reprocessing===\n{{Main|Nuclear reprocessing}}\n{{See also|Spent nuclear fuel}}\n\nSpent fuel discharged from reactors contains appreciable quantities of fissile (U-235 and Pu-239), fertile (U-238), and other [[radioactive]] materials, including [[nuclear poison|reaction poisons]], which is why the fuel had to be removed. These fissile and fertile materials can be chemically separated and recovered from the spent fuel. The recovered uranium and plutonium can, if economic and institutional conditions permit, be recycled for use as nuclear fuel. This is currently not done for civilian spent nuclear fuel in the [[United States]].\n\nMixed oxide, or [[MOX fuel]], is a blend of [[reprocessed uranium]] and plutonium and depleted uranium which behaves similarly, although not identically, to the enriched uranium feed for which most nuclear reactors were designed. MOX fuel is an alternative to low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel used in the light water reactors which predominate nuclear power generation.\n\nCurrently, plants in Europe are reprocessing spent fuel from utilities in Europe and Japan. Reprocessing of spent commercial-reactor nuclear fuel is currently not permitted in the [[United States]] due to the perceived danger of [[nuclear proliferation]]. The [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush Administration's]] [[Global Nuclear Energy Partnership]] proposed that the U.S. form an international partnership to see spent nuclear fuel reprocessed in a way that renders the plutonium in it usable for nuclear fuel but not for [[nuclear weapon]]s.\n\n===Partitioning and transmutation===\nAs an alternative to the disposal of the [[PUREX raffinate]] in [[glass]] or [[Synroc]] matrix, the most [[radiotoxic]] elements could be removed through advanced reprocessing. After separation, the [[minor actinides]] and some long-lived [[fission product]]s could be converted to short-lived or stable [[isotope]]s by either [[neutron]] or [[photon]] irradiation. This is called [[Nuclear transmutation|transmutation]].

Current plans call for the ultimate disposal of the wastes in solid form in a licensed deep, stable geologic structure called a [[deep geological repository]]. The Department of Energy chose [[Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository|Yucca Mountain]] as the location for the repository. Its opening has been repeatedly delayed. Since 1999 thousands of nuclear waste shipments have been stored at the [[Waste Isolation Pilot Plant]] in New Mexico.\n\n[[Fast-neutron reactor]]s can fission all actinides, while the [[thorium fuel cycle]] produces low levels of [[transuranic]]s. Unlike LWRs, in principle these fuel cycles could recycle their [[plutonium]] and [[minor actinides]] and leave only [[fission product]]s and [[activation product]]s as waste. The highly radioactive [[medium-lived fission product]]s [[Cs-137]] and [[Sr-90]] diminish by a factor of 10 each century; while the [[long-lived fission product]]s have relatively low radioactivity, often compared favorably to that of the original uranium ore.\n\n[[Horizontal drillhole disposal]] describes proposals to drill over one kilometer vertically, and two kilometers horizontally in the earth\u2019s crust, for the purpose of disposing of high-level waste forms such as [[spent nuclear fuel]], [[Caesium-137]], or [[Strontium-90]].

Spent fuel includes [[fission products]], which generally must be treated as [[radioactive waste|waste]], as well as uranium, plutonium, and other transuranic elements. Where plutonium is recycled, it is normally reused once in light water reactors, although fast reactors could lead to more complete recycling of plutonium.<ref>{{cite book |title=Energy and the New Reality 2: Carbon-Free Energy Supply \u2013 section 8.4 |author=Harvey, L.D.D.|isbn=978-1849710732|year=2010|publisher=Earthscan}}</ref>\n\n===Once-through nuclear fuel cycle===\n[[Image:Oncethroughcycle.png|500px|thumb|right|A once through (or open) fuel cycle]]\nNot a cycle ''per se'', fuel is used once and then sent to storage without further processing save additional packaging to provide for better isolation from the [[biosphere]].

Here, the [[fission product]]s, [[minor actinides]], [[activation product]]s, and [[reprocessed uranium]] are separated from the reactor-grade [[plutonium]], which can then be fabricated into [[MOX fuel]]. Because the proportion of the non-[[fissile]] [[even and odd numbers|even]]-[[atomic mass|mass]] [[isotopes of plutonium]] rises with each pass through the cycle, there are currently no plans to reuse plutonium from used MOX fuel for a third pass in a [[thermal reactor]]. If [[fast reactor]]s become available, they may be able to burn these, or almost any other [[actinide]] [[isotope]]s.\n\nThe use of a medium-scale [[Nuclear reprocessing|reprocessing]] facility onsite, and the use of [[pyroprocessing]] rather than the present day aqueous reprocessing, is claimed to considerably reduce the [[Nuclear proliferation|proliferation]] potential or possible diversion of fissile material as the processing facility is [[in-situ]]/integral. Similarly as plutonium is not separated on its own in the pyroprocessing cycle, rather all actinides are \"[[electrowinning|electro-won]]\" or \"refined\" from the spent fuel, the plutonium is never separated on its own, instead it comes over into the new fuel mixed with gamma and alpha emitting actinides, species that \"self-protect\" it in numerous possible thief scenarios.\n\nBeginning in 2016 Russia has been testing and is now deploying [[Remix Fuel]] in which the spent nuclear fuel is put through a process like Pyroprocessing that separates the reactor Grade Plutonium and remaining Uranium from the fission products and fuel cladding. This mixed metal is then combined with a small quantity of medium enriched Uranium with approximately 17% U-235 concentration to make a new combined metal oxide fuel with 1% Reactor Grade plutonium and a U-235 concentration of 4%. These fuel rods are suitable for use in standard PWR reactors as the Plutonium content is no higher than that which exists at the end of cycle in the spent nuclear fuel. As of February 2020 Russia was deploying this fuel in some of their fleet of [[VVER]] reactors.<ref>https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/conversion-enrichment-and-fabrication/fuel-fabrication.aspx#ECSArticleLink5</ref><ref>https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/REMIX-fuel-pilot-testing-starts-at-Balakovo-reacto</ref>\n\n===Minor actinides recycling===\nIt has been proposed that in addition to the use of plutonium, the [[minor actinide]]s could be used in a critical power reactor.

In principle, it should be possible to derive energy from the fission of any actinide nucleus. With a careful reactor design, all the actinides in the fuel can be consumed, leaving only lighter elements with short [[half-life|half-lives]]. Whereas this has been done in prototype plants, no such reactor has ever been operated on a large scale.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nIt so happens that the [[neutron cross-section]] of many actinides decreases with increasing neutron energy, but the ratio of fission to simple activation ([[neutron capture]]) changes in favour of fission as the neutron energy increases. Thus with a sufficiently high neutron energy, it should be possible to destroy even curium without the generation of the transcurium metals. This could be very desirable as it would make it significantly easier to reprocess and handle the actinide fuel.\n\nOne promising alternative from this perspective is an [[accelerator-driven sub-critical reactor]] / [[subcritical reactor]].

In the case of protons, very fast neutrons will spall off the target, while in the case of the electrons, very high energy [[photon]]s will be generated. These high-energy neutrons and photons will then be able to cause the fission of the heavy actinides.\n\nSuch reactors compare very well to other neutron sources in terms of neutron energy:\n\n* Thermal 0 to 100&nbsp;eV\n* Epithermal 100&nbsp;eV to 100&nbsp;keV\n* Fast (from [[nuclear fission]]) 100&nbsp;keV to 3&nbsp;MeV\n* DD [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] 2.5&nbsp;MeV\n* DT fusion 14&nbsp;MeV\n* Accelerator driven core 200&nbsp;MeV (lead driven by 1.6&nbsp;GeV [[proton]]s)\n* [[Muon-catalyzed fusion]] 7&nbsp;GeV.\n\nAs an alternative, the curium-244, with a half-life of 18 years, could be left to decay into plutonium-240 before being used in fuel in a fast reactor.\n\n[[Image:Twincyclefuelcycle.png|thumb|center|853px|A pair of fuel cycles in which uranium and plutonium are kept separate from the minor actinides. The minor actinide cycle is kept within the green box.]]\n\n====Fuel or targets for this actinide transmutation====\nTo date the nature of the fuel (targets) for actinide transformation has not been chosen.\n\nIf actinides are transmuted in a [[Subcritical reactor]], it is likely that the fuel will have to be able to tolerate more thermal cycles than conventional fuel. An accelerator-driven sub-critical reactor is unlikely to be able to maintain a constant operation period for equally long times as a critical reactor, and each time the accelerator stops then the fuel will cool down.\n\nOn the other hand, if actinides are destroyed using a fast reactor, such as an [[Integral Fast Reactor]], then the fuel will most likely not be exposed to many more thermal cycles than in a normal power station.\n\nDepending on the matrix the process can generate more transuranics from the matrix. This could either be viewed as good (generate more fuel) or can be viewed as bad (generation of more ''radiotoxic'' [[transuranic element]]s). A series of different matrices exists which can control this production of heavy actinides.\n\nFissile nuclei (such as <sup>233</sup>U, <sup>235</sup>U, and <sup>239</sup>Pu) respond well to [[delayed neutrons]] and are thus important to keep a critical reactor stable; this limits the amount of minor actinides that can be destroyed in a critical reactor. As a consequence, it is important that the chosen matrix allows the reactor to keep the ratio of fissile to non-fissile nuclei high, as this enables it to destroy the long-lived actinides safely. In contrast, the power output of a sub-critical reactor is limited by the intensity of the driving particle accelerator, and thus it need not contain any uranium or plutonium at all. In such a system, it may be preferable to have an inert matrix that does not produce additional long-lived isotopes.\n\n=====Actinides in an inert matrix=====\nThe actinides will be mixed with a metal which will not form more actinides; for instance, an [[alloy]] of actinides in a solid such as [[zirconia]] could be used.\n\n=====Actinides in a thorium matrix=====\nUpon neutron bombardment, [[thorium]] can be converted to [[uranium-233]]. <sup>233</sup>U is fissile, and has a larger fission cross section than both <sup>235</sup>U and <sup>238</sup>U, and thus it is far less likely to produce higher actinides through neutron capture.\n\n=====Actinides in a uranium matrix=====\nIf the actinides are incorporated into a uranium-metal or uranium-oxide matrix, then the neutron capture of <sup>238</sup>U is likely to generate new plutonium-239. An advantage of mixing the actinides with uranium and plutonium is that the large fission cross sections of <sup>235</sup>U and <sup>239</sup>Pu for the less energetic delayed neutrons could make the reaction stable enough to be carried out in a critical [[fast reactor]], which is likely to be both cheaper and simpler than an accelerator driven system.\n\n=====Mixed matrix=====\nIt is also possible to create a matrix made from a mix of the above-mentioned materials. This is most commonly done in fast reactors where one may wish to keep the breeding ratio of new fuel high enough to keep powering the reactor, but still low enough that the generated actinides can be safely destroyed without transporting them to another site. One way to do this is to use fuel where actinides and uranium is mixed with inert zirconium, producing fuel elements with the desired properties.\n\n===Thorium cycle===\n{{Main|Thorium fuel cycle}}\nIn the thorium fuel cycle [[thorium-232]] absorbs a [[neutron]] in either a fast or thermal reactor. The thorium-233 [[beta decay]]s to [[protactinium]]-233 and then to [[uranium-233]], which in turn is used as fuel. Hence, like [[uranium-238]], thorium-232 is a [[fertile material]].\n:<chem>\\overset{neutron}{n} + ^{232}_{90}Th -> ^{233}_{90}Th ->[\\beta^-] ^{233}_{91}Pa ->[\\beta^-] \\overset{fuel}{^{233}_{92}U}</chem>\nAfter starting the reactor with existing U-233 or some other [[fissile material]] such as [[Uranium-235|U-235]] or [[Pu-239]], a breeding cycle similar to but more efficient<ref name=\"THFUELCYCLE\">See [[thorium fuel cycle]]</ref> than that with U-238 and plutonium can be created. The Th-232 absorbs a neutron to become Th-233 which quickly decays to [[protactinium]]-233. Protactinium-233 in turn decays with a half-life of 27 days to U-233. In some [[molten salt reactor]] designs, the Pa-233 is extracted and protected from neutrons (which could transform it to Pa-234 and then to [[Uranium-234|U-234]]), until it has decayed to U-233. This is done in order to improve the [[breeder reactor#Breeding ratio|breeding ratio]] which is low compared to [[fast reactor]]s.\n\n[[Thorium]] is at least 4-5 times more abundant in nature than all of uranium isotopes combined; thorium is fairly evenly spread around Earth with a lot of countries<ref>See [[Thorium#Occurrence|Thorium occurrence]] for discussion of abundance.</ref>\nhaving huge supplies of it; preparation of thorium fuel does not require difficult\n<ref name=\"THFUELCYCLE\" />\nand expensive enrichment processes; the thorium fuel cycle creates mainly Uranium-233 contaminated with [[Uranium-232]] which makes it harder to use in a normal, pre-assembled nuclear weapon which is stable over long periods of time (unfortunately drawbacks are much lower for immediate use weapons or where final assembly occurs just prior to usage time); elimination of at least the [[transuranic]] portion of the nuclear waste problem is possible in [[Molten-salt reactor|MSR]] and other breeder reactor designs.\n\nOne of the earliest efforts to use a thorium fuel cycle took place at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] in the 1960s. An experimental reactor was built based on [[molten salt reactor]] technology to study the feasibility of such an approach, using [[thorium fluoride]] [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]] kept hot enough to be liquid, thus eliminating the need for fabricating fuel elements.  This effort culminated in the [[Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment]] that used <sup>232</sup>Th as the fertile material and <sup>233</sup>U as the fissile fuel. Due to a lack of funding, the MSR program was discontinued in 1976.\n\n===Current industrial activity===\nCurrently the only isotopes used as nuclear fuel are [[uranium-235]] (U-235), [[uranium-238]] (U-238) and [[plutonium-239]], although the proposed thorium fuel cycle has advantages. Some modern reactors, with minor modifications, can use [[thorium]]. Thorium is approximately three times more abundant in the [[crust (geology)|Earth's crust]] than uranium (and 550 times more abundant than uranium-235). There has been little exploration for thorium resources, and thus the [[proved resource]] is small. [[Thorium]] is more plentiful than [[uranium]] in some countries, notably [[Nuclear power in India|India]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.npcil.nic.in/nupower_vol11_1-3/chidambaram.htm |title= Towards an Energy Independent India |year= 1997 | author=  Chidambaram R. |work= Nu-Power |publisher= Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited |accessdate= 2008-01-15 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071217050844/http://www.npcil.nic.in/nupower_vol11_1-3/chidambaram.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-12-17}}</ref>\n\n[[Heavy water reactor]]s and graphite-moderated reactors can use [[natural uranium]], but the vast majority of the world's reactors require [[enriched uranium]], in which the ratio of U-235 to U-238 is increased.

It consists of steps in the ''front end'', which are the preparation of the fuel, steps in the ''service period'' in which the fuel is used during reactor operation, and steps in the ''back end'', which are necessary to safely manage, contain, and either [[nuclear reprocessing|reprocess]] or dispose of [[used nuclear fuel|spent nuclear fuel]]. If spent fuel is not reprocessed, the fuel cycle is referred to as an ''open fuel cycle'' (or a ''once-through fuel cycle''); if the spent fuel is reprocessed, it is referred to as a ''closed fuel cycle''.\n\n==Basic concepts==\n\n[[Nuclear power]] relies on fissionable material that can sustain a [[nuclear chain reaction|chain reaction]] with [[neutron]]s. Examples of such materials include [[uranium]] and [[plutonium]]. Most nuclear reactors use a [[Neutron moderator|moderator]] to lower the [[kinetic energy]] of the neutrons and increase the probability that [[Nuclear fission|fission]] will occur. This allows reactors to use material with far lower concentration of [[fissile]] [[isotopes]] than are needed for [[nuclear weapon]]s.  [[Graphite]] and [[heavy water]] are the most effective moderators, because they slow the neutrons through collisions without absorbing them. [[Nuclear reactor technology|Reactors]] using [[Heavy water reactor|heavy water]] or graphite as the moderator can operate using [[natural uranium]].\n\nA [[light water reactor]] (LWR) uses water in the form that occurs in nature, and requires fuel enriched to higher concentrations of fissile isotopes. Typically, LWRs use uranium [[Enriched uranium|enriched]] to 3\u20135% [[U-235]], the only fissile isotope that is found in significant quantity in nature. One alternative to this low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel is [[MOX fuel|mixed oxide]] (MOX) fuel produced by blending plutonium with natural or depleted uranium, and these fuels provide an avenue to utilize surplus [[weapons-grade]] plutonium. Another type of MOX fuel involves mixing LEU with [[Thorium fuel cycle|thorium]], which generates the fissile isotope [[Uranium-233|U-233]]. Both plutonium and U-233 are produced from the absorption of neutrons by [[irradiating]] [[fertile material]]s in a reactor, in particular the common uranium isotope [[Uranium-238|U-238]] and [[thorium]], respectively, and can be separated from spent uranium and thorium fuels in [[Nuclear reprocessing|reprocessing plants]].\n\nSome reactors do not use moderators to slow the neutrons. Like nuclear weapons, which also use unmoderated or \"fast\" neutrons, these [[fast-neutron reactor]]s require much higher concentrations of fissile isotopes in order to sustain a chain reaction. They are also capable of [[Breeder reactor|breeding]] fissile isotopes from fertile materials; a [[breeder reactor]] is one that generates more fissile material in this way than it consumes.\n\nDuring the nuclear reaction inside a reactor, the fissile isotopes in nuclear fuel are consumed, producing more and more [[Nuclear fission product|fission products]], most of which are considered [[radioactive waste]]. The buildup of fission products and consumption of fissile isotopes eventually stop the nuclear reaction, causing the fuel to become a [[spent nuclear fuel]]. When 3% enriched LEU fuel is used, the spent fuel typically consists of roughly 1% U-235, 95% U-238, 1% plutonium and 3% fission products. Spent fuel and other high-level radioactive waste is extremely hazardous, although nuclear reactors produce orders of magnitude smaller volumes of waste compared to other power plants because of the high energy density of nuclear fuel. Safe management of these byproducts of nuclear power, including their storage and disposal, is a difficult problem for any country using nuclear power{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}.\n\n==Front end==\n<gallery>\nImage:Uranium ore square.jpg|'''1 [[Uranium ore]]''' \u2013 the principal raw material of nuclear fuel\nImage:Yellowcake.jpg|'''2 [[Yellowcake]]''' \u2013 the form in which uranium is transported to a conversion plant\nImage:UF6 square.jpg|'''3 [[Uranium hexafluoride|UF<sub>6</sub>]]''' \u2013 used in enrichment\nImage:Nuclear fuel pellets.jpeg|'''4 [[Nuclear fuel]]''' \u2013 a compact, inert, insoluble solid\n</gallery>\n\n===Exploration===\nA deposit of uranium, such as [[uraninite]], discovered by geophysical techniques, is evaluated and sampled to determine the amounts of uranium materials that are extractable at specified costs from the deposit. Uranium reserves are the amounts of ore that are estimated to be recoverable at stated costs.\n\nNaturally occurring uranium consists primarily of two isotopes U-238 and U-235, with 99.28% of the metal being U-238 while 0.71% is U-235, and the remaining 0.01% is mostly U-234. The number in such names refers to the [[isotope]]'s atomic [[mass number]], which is the number of [[proton]]s plus the number of [[neutron]]s in the [[atomic nucleus]].\n\nThe atomic nucleus of U-235 will nearly always fission when struck by a [[free neutron]], and the isotope is therefore said to be a \"[[fissile]]\" isotope. The nucleus of a U-238 atom on the other hand, rather than undergoing fission when struck by a free neutron, will nearly always absorb the neutron and yield an atom of the isotope U-239. This isotope then undergoes natural radioactive decay to yield Pu-239, which, like U-235, is a fissile isotope. The atoms of U-238 are said to be fertile, because, through neutron irradiation in the core, some eventually yield atoms of fissile Pu-239.\n\n===Mining===\n{{Main|Uranium mining}}\nUranium ore can be extracted through conventional mining in open pit and underground methods similar to those used for mining other metals. [[In-situ leach]] [[mining]] methods also are used to mine uranium in the [[United States]]. In this technology, uranium is leached from the in-place ore through an array of regularly spaced wells and is then recovered from the leach solution at a surface plant. Uranium ores in the United States typically range from about 0.05 to 0.3% uranium oxide (U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>). Some uranium deposits developed in other countries are of higher grade and are also larger than deposits mined in the United States. Uranium is also present in very low-grade amounts (50 to 200 parts per million) in some domestic [[phosphate]]-bearing deposits of marine origin. Because very large quantities of phosphate-bearing rock are mined for the production of wet-process [[phosphoric acid]] used in high analysis [[fertilizer]]s and other phosphate chemicals, at some phosphate processing plants the uranium, although present in very low concentrations, can be economically recovered from the process stream.\n\n===Milling===\nMined uranium ores normally are processed by [[Grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]] the ore materials to a uniform particle size and then treating the ore to extract the uranium by chemical leaching. The milling process commonly yields dry powder-form material consisting of natural uranium, \"[[yellowcake]]\", which is sold on the uranium market as U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>. Note that the material isn't always yellow.\n\n===Uranium conversion===\nUsually milled uranium oxide, U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub> ([[triuranium octoxide]]) is then processed into either of two substances depending on the intended use.\n\nFor use in most reactors, U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub> is usually converted to [[uranium hexafluoride]] (UF<sub>6</sub>), the input stock for most commercial uranium enrichment facilities. A solid at room temperature, uranium hexafluoride becomes gaseous at 57&nbsp;\u00b0C (134&nbsp;\u00b0F). At this stage of the cycle, the uranium hexafluoride conversion product still has the natural isotopic mix (99.28% of U-238 plus 0.71% of U-235).\n\nFor use in reactors such as [[CANDU]] which do not require enriched fuel, the U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub> may instead be converted to [[uranium dioxide]] (UO<sub>2</sub>) which can be included in [[ceramic]] fuel elements.\n\nIn the current nuclear industry, the volume of material converted directly to UO<sub>2</sub> is typically quite small compared to that converted to UF<sub>6</sub>.\n\n===Enrichment===<!-- This section is linked from [[Nuclear proliferation]] -->\n{{Main|Enriched uranium}}\n[[Image:Nuclear Fuel Cycle.png|330px|thumb|'''Nuclear fuel cycle''' begins when uranium is mined, enriched and manufactured to nuclear fuel (1) which is delivered to a nuclear power plant. After usage in the power plant the spent fuel is delivered to a reprocessing plant (if fuel is recycled) (2) or to a final repository (if no recycling is done) (3) for geological disposition. In [[nuclear reprocessing|reprocessing]] 95% of spent fuel can be recycled to be returned to usage in a nuclear power plant (4).]]\n\nThe natural concentration (0.71%) of the fissionable isotope U-235 is less than that required to sustain a nuclear chain reaction in [[light water reactor]] cores.  Accordingly UF<sub>6</sub> produced from natural uranium sources must be enriched to a higher concentration of the fissionable isotope before being used as nuclear fuel in such reactors. The level of enrichment for a particular nuclear fuel order is specified by the customer according to the application they will use it for: light-water reactor fuel normally is enriched to 3.5% U-235, but uranium enriched to lower concentrations is also required. Enrichment is accomplished using any of several methods of [[isotope separation]]. [[Gaseous diffusion]] and [[gas centrifuge]] are the commonly used uranium enrichment methods, but new enrichment technologies are currently being developed.\n\nThe bulk (96%) of the byproduct from enrichment is [[depleted uranium]] (DU), which can be used for [[armor]], [[kinetic energy penetrator]]s, [[radiation shielding]] and [[Sailing ballast|ballast]]. As of 2008 there are vast quantities of depleted uranium in storage. The [[United States Department of Energy]] alone has 470,000 [[tonne]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://web.ead.anl.gov/uranium/faq/storage/faq16.cfm |title= How much depleted uranium hexafluoride is stored in the United States? |work= Depleted UF6 Management Information Network |accessdate= 2008-01-15}}</ref> About 95% of depleted uranium is stored as [[uranium hexafluoride]] (UF<sub>6</sub>).\n\n===Fabrication===\n{{Main|Nuclear fuel}}\nFor use as nuclear fuel, enriched uranium hexafluoride is converted into [[uranium dioxide]] (UO<sub>2</sub>) powder that is then processed into pellet form. The pellets are then fired in a high temperature [[sintering]] [[furnace]] to create hard, [[ceramic]] pellets of [[enriched uranium]]. The cylindrical pellets then undergo a grinding process to achieve a uniform pellet size. The pellets are stacked, according to each [[nuclear reactor core]]'s design specifications, into tubes of corrosion-resistant metal [[alloy]]. The tubes are sealed to contain the fuel pellets: these tubes are called fuel rods. The finished fuel rods are grouped in special fuel assemblies that are then used to build up the nuclear fuel core of a power reactor.\n\nThe alloy used for the tubes depends on the design of the reactor. [[Stainless steel]] was used in the past, but most reactors now use a [[zirconium alloy]]. For the most common types of reactors, [[boiling water reactor]]s (BWR) and [[pressurized water reactor]]s (PWR), the tubes are assembled into bundles<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.pplweb.com/NR/rdonlyres/F63D7386-A57E-46C6-90A5-857D513B0254/0/seic_plantguide.pdf |title= Susquehanna Nuclear Energy Guide |publisher= PPL Corporation |accessdate= 2008-01-15 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071129121008/http://www.pplweb.com/NR/rdonlyres/F63D7386-A57E-46C6-90A5-857D513B0254/0/seic_plantguide.pdf |archivedate= 2007-11-29 }}</ref> with the tubes spaced precise distances apart. These bundles are then given a unique identification number, which enables them to be tracked from manufacture through use and into disposal.\n\n==Service period==\n\n===Transport of radioactive materials===\n[[Transport]] is an integral part of the nuclear fuel cycle. There are nuclear power reactors in operation in several countries but uranium mining is viable in only a few areas. Also, in the course of over forty years of operation by the nuclear industry, a number of specialized facilities have been developed in various locations around the world to provide fuel cycle services and there is a need to transport nuclear materials to and from these facilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wnti.co.uk/media-centre/nuclear-fuel-cycle.aspx |title=Nuclear Fuel Cycle &#124; World Nuclear Transport Institute |publisher=Wnti.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-04-20}}</ref> Most transports of [[nuclear fuel]] material occur between different stages of the cycle, but occasionally a material may be transported between similar facilities. With some exceptions, nuclear fuel cycle materials are transported in solid form, the exception being [[uranium hexafluoride]] (UF<sub>6</sub>) which is considered a gas. Most of the material used in nuclear fuel is transported several times during the cycle. Transports are frequently international, and are often over large distances. Nuclear materials are generally transported by specialized transport companies.\n\nSince nuclear materials are [[radioactive]], it is important to ensure that radiation exposure of those involved in the transport of such materials and of the general public along transport routes is limited. Packaging for nuclear materials includes, where appropriate, [[radiation shielding|shielding]] to reduce potential radiation exposures. In the case of some materials, such as fresh uranium fuel assemblies, the radiation levels are negligible and no shielding is required. Other materials, such as spent fuel and high-level waste, are highly radioactive and require special handling. To limit the risk in transporting highly radioactive materials, containers known as [[spent nuclear fuel shipping cask]]s are used which are designed to maintain integrity under normal transportation conditions and during hypothetical accident conditions.\n\n===In-core fuel management===\nA [[nuclear reactor core]] is composed of a few hundred \"assemblies\", arranged in a regular array of cells, each cell being formed by a fuel or control rod surrounded, in most designs, by a [[neutron moderator|moderator]] and [[coolant]], which is water in most reactors.\n\nBecause of the [[nuclear fission|fission]] process that consumes the fuels, the old fuel rods must be replaced periodically with fresh ones (this is called a (replacement) cycle). During a given replacement cycle only some of the assemblies (typically one-third) are replaced since fuel depletion occurs at different rates at different places within the reactor core. Furthermore, for efficiency reasons, it is not a good policy to put the new assemblies exactly at the location of the removed ones. Even bundles of the same age will have different burn-up levels due to their previous positions in the core. Thus the available bundles must be arranged in such a way that the yield is maximized, while safety limitations and operational constraints are satisfied. Consequently, reactor operators are faced with the so-called '''optimal fuel reloading problem''', which consists of optimizing the rearrangement of all the assemblies, the old and fresh ones, while still maximizing the reactivity of the reactor core so as to maximise fuel burn-up and minimise fuel-cycle costs.\n\nThis is a [[discrete optimization]] problem, and computationally infeasible by current [[combinatorial]] methods, due to the huge number of [[permutation]]s and the complexity of each computation. Many [[numerical method]]s have been proposed for solving it and many commercial [[software]] packages have been written to support fuel management. This is an ongoing issue in reactor operations as no definitive solution to this problem has been found. Operators use a combination of [[computation]]al and [[empirical]] techniques to manage this problem.\n\n====The study of used fuel====\n{{Main|Post irradiation examination}}\nUsed nuclear fuel is studied in [[Post irradiation examination]], where used fuel is examined to know more about the processes that occur in fuel during use, and how these might alter the outcome of an accident. For example, during normal use, the fuel expands due to thermal expansion, which can cause cracking. Most [[nuclear fuel]] is uranium dioxide, which is a [[Cubic crystal system|cubic]] solid with a structure similar to that of [[calcium fluoride]]. In used fuel the solid state structure of most of the solid remains the same as that of pure cubic uranium dioxide. SIMFUEL is the name given to the simulated spent fuel which is made by mixing finely ground metal oxides, grinding as a slurry, spray drying it before heating in hydrogen/argon to 1700 <sup>o</sup>C.<ref>A good report on the microstructure of used fuel is Lucuta PG ''et al.'' (1991) ''J Nuclear Materials'' '''178''':48-60</ref> In SIMFUEL, 4.1% of the volume of the solid was in the form of metal [[nanoparticle]]s which are made of [[molybdenum]], [[ruthenium]], [[rhodium]] and [[palladium]]. Most of these metal particles are of the \u03b5 phase ([[Hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal]]) of Mo-Ru-Rh-Pd alloy, while smaller amounts of the \u03b1 ([[Cubic crystal system|cubic]]) and \u03c3 ([[Tetragonal crystal system|tetragonal]]) phases of these metals were found in the SIMFUEL. Also present within the SIMFUEL was a cubic [[perovskite]] phase which is a [[barium]] [[strontium]] [[zirconium|zirconate]] (Ba<sub>x</sub>Sr<sub>1\u2212x</sub>ZrO<sub>3</sub>).\n\n[[Image:UO2lattice.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The solid state structure of uranium dioxide, the oxygen atoms are in green and the uranium atoms in red]]\n\nUranium dioxide is very insoluble in water, but after oxidation it can be converted to uranium trioxide or another uranium(VI) compound which is much more soluble. Uranium dioxide (UO<sub>2</sub>) can be oxidised to an oxygen rich hyperstoichiometric oxide (UO<sub>2+x</sub>) which can be further oxidised to U<sub>4</sub>O<sub>9</sub>, U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub> and UO<sub>3</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O.\n\nBecause used fuel contains alpha emitters (plutonium and the [[minor actinides]]), the effect of adding an alpha emitter (<sup>238</sup>Pu) to uranium dioxide on the leaching rate of the oxide has been investigated. For the crushed oxide, adding <sup>238</sup>Pu tended to increase the rate of leaching, but the difference in the leaching rate between 0.1 and 10% <sup>238</sup>Pu was very small.<ref>V.V. Rondinella VV ''et al.'' (2000) ''Radiochimica Acta'' '''88''':527\u2013531</ref>\n\nThe concentration of [[carbonate]] in the water which is in contact with the used fuel has a considerable effect on the rate of corrosion, because [[uranium]](VI) forms soluble anionic carbonate complexes such as [UO<sub>2</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2\u2212</sup> and [UO<sub>2</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>4\u2212</sup>. When carbonate ions are absent, and the water is not strongly acidic, the hexavalent uranium compounds which form on oxidation of [[uranium dioxide]] often form insoluble hydrated [[uranium trioxide]] phases.<ref>For a review of the corrosion of uranium dioxide in a waste store which explains much of the chemistry, see Shoesmith DW (2000) ''J Nuclear Materials'' '''282''':1\u201331</ref>\n\nThin films of uranium dioxide can be deposited upon gold surfaces by \u2018[[sputtering]]\u2019 using uranium metal and an [[argon]]/[[oxygen]] gas mixture. These gold surfaces modified with uranium dioxide have been used for both [[cyclic voltammetry]] and [[AC impedance]] experiments, and these offer an insight into the likely leaching behaviour of uranium dioxide.<ref>Miserque F ''et al.'' (2001) ''J Nuclear Materials'' '''298''':280\u2013290</ref>\n\n====Fuel cladding interactions====\nThe study of the nuclear fuel cycle includes the study of the behaviour of nuclear materials both under normal conditions and under accident conditions. For example, there has been much work on how [[uranium dioxide]] based fuel interacts with the [[zirconium]] alloy tubing used to cover it. During use, the fuel swells due to [[thermal expansion]] and then starts to react with the surface of the zirconium alloy, forming a new layer which contains both fuel and zirconium (from the cladding). Then, on the fuel side of this mixed layer, there is a layer of fuel which has a higher [[caesium]] to [[uranium]] ratio than most of the fuel. This is because [[xenon]] isotopes are formed as [[fission products]] that diffuse out of the lattice of the fuel into voids such as the narrow gap between the fuel and the cladding. After diffusing into these voids, it decays to caesium isotopes. Because of the thermal gradient which exists in the fuel during use, the volatile fission products tend to be driven from the centre of the pellet to the rim area.<ref>Further reading on fuel cladding interactions: Tanaka K ''et al.'' (2006) ''J Nuclear Materials'' '''357''':58\u201368</ref> Below is a graph of the temperature of uranium metal, uranium nitride and [[uranium dioxide]] as a function of distance from the centre of a 20&nbsp;mm diameter pellet with a rim temperature of 200 <sup>o</sup>C. The uranium dioxide (because of its poor thermal conductivity) will overheat at the centre of the pellet, while the other more thermally conductive forms of uranium remain below their melting points.\n\n[[File:Rim200pd1000rad1000fueltemp.png|center|thumb|450px|Temperature profile for a 20&nbsp;mm diameter fuel pellet with a power density of 1 kW per cubic meter. The fuels other than uranium dioxide are not compromised.]]\n\n====Normal and abnormal conditions====\n\nThe nuclear chemistry associated with the nuclear fuel cycle can be divided into two main areas; one area is concerned with operation under the intended conditions while the other area is concerned with maloperation conditions where some alteration from the normal operating conditions has occurred or (''more rarely'') an accident is occurring.\n\nThe releases of radioactivity from normal operations are the small planned releases from uranium ore processing, enrichment, power reactors, reprocessing plants and waste stores. These can be in different chemical/physical form from releases which could occur under accident conditions. In addition the isotope signature of a hypothetical accident may be very different from that of a planned normal operational discharge of radioactivity to the environment.\n\nJust because a radioisotope is released it does not mean it will enter a human and then cause harm. For instance, the migration of radioactivity can be altered by the binding of the radioisotope to the surfaces of soil particles. For example, [[caesium]] (Cs) binds tightly to clay minerals such as [[illite]] and [[montmorillonite]], hence it remains in the upper layers of soil where it can be accessed by plants with shallow roots (such as grass). Hence grass and mushrooms can carry a considerable amount of <sup>137</sup>Cs which can be transferred to humans through the food chain. But <sup>137</sup>Cs is not able to migrate quickly through most soils and thus is unlikely to contaminate [[Water well|well]] water. Colloids of soil minerals can migrate through soil so simple binding of a metal to the surfaces of soil particles does not completely fix the metal.\n\nAccording to Ji\u0159\u00ed H\u00e1la's [[text book]], the distribution coefficient K<sub>d</sub> is the ratio of the soil's radioactivity (Bq g<sup>\u22121</sup>) to that of the soil water (Bq ml<sup>\u22121</sup>). If the radioisotope is tightly bound to the minerals in the soil, then less radioactivity can be absorbed by crops and [[grass]] growing on the soil.\n\n* [[Cs-137]] K<sub>d</sub> = 1000\n* [[plutonium|Pu-239]] K<sub>d</sub> = 10000 to 100000\n* [[strontium|Sr-90]] K<sub>d</sub> = 80 to 150\n* [[Iodine|I-131]] K<sub>d</sub> = 0.007 to 50\n\nIn dairy farming, one of the best countermeasures against <sup>137</sup>Cs is to mix up the soil by deeply ploughing the soil. This has the effect of putting the <sup>137</sup>Cs out of reach of the shallow roots of the grass, hence the level of radioactivity in the grass will be lowered. Also after a nuclear war or serious accident, the removal of top few cm of soil and its burial in a shallow trench will reduce the long-term gamma dose to humans due to <sup>137</sup>Cs, as the gamma photons will be attenuated by their passage through the soil.\n\nEven after the radioactive element arrives at the roots of the plant, the metal may be rejected by the biochemistry of the plant. The details of the uptake of <sup>90</sup>Sr and <sup>137</sup>Cs into [[sunflower]]s grown under [[hydroponic]] conditions has been reported.<ref>P. Soudek, \u0160. Valenov\u00e1, Z. Vav\u0159\u00edkov\u00e1 and T. Van\u011bk, ''Journal of Environmental Radioactivity'', 2006, '''88''', 236\u2013250</ref> The caesium was found in the leaf veins, in the stem and in the [[Apical meristem|apical]] leaves. It was found that 12% of the caesium entered the plant, and 20% of the strontium. This paper also reports details of the effect of [[potassium]], [[ammonium]] and [[calcium]] ions on the uptake of the radioisotopes.\n\nIn [[livestock]] farming, an important countermeasure against <sup>137</sup>Cs is to feed animals a small amount of [[Prussian blue]]. This [[iron]] potassium [[cyanide]] compound acts as an [[ion-exchanger]]. The cyanide is so tightly bonded to the iron that it is safe for a human to eat several grams of Prussian blue per day. The Prussian blue reduces the [[biological half-life]] (different from the [[half-life|nuclear half-life]]) of the caesium. The physical or nuclear half-life of <sup>137</sup>Cs is about 30 years. This is a constant which can not be changed but the biological half-life is not a constant. It will change according to the nature and habits of the organism for which it is expressed. Caesium in humans normally has a biological half-life of between one and four months. An added advantage of the Prussian blue is that the caesium which is stripped from the animal in the [[feces|droppings]] is in a form which is not available to plants. Hence it prevents the caesium from being recycled. The form of Prussian blue required for the treatment of humans or animals is a special grade. Attempts to use the [[pigment]] grade used in [[paint]]s have not been successful. Note that a good{{According to whom|date=July 2012}} source of data on the subject of caesium in [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] fallout exists at [http://www.uiar.org.ua/Eng/index.htm] (''Ukrainian Research Institute for Agricultural Radiology'').\n\n====Release of radioactivity from fuel during normal use and accidents====\n\nThe IAEA assume that under normal operation the coolant of a water-cooled reactor will contain some radioactivity<ref>Generic Assessment Procedures for Determining Protective Actions During a Reactor Accident, IAEA-TECDOC-955, 1997, p. 169</ref> but during a reactor accident the coolant radioactivity level may rise. The IAEA states that under a series of different conditions different amounts of the core inventory can be released from the fuel, the four conditions the IAEA consider are ''normal operation'', a spike in coolant activity due to a sudden shutdown/loss of pressure (core remains covered with water), a cladding failure resulting in the release of the activity in the fuel/cladding gap (this could be due to the fuel being uncovered by the loss of water for 15\u201330 minutes where the cladding reached a temperature of 650\u20131250 <sup>o</sup>C) or a melting of the core (the fuel will have to be uncovered for at least 30 minutes, and the cladding would reach a temperature in excess of 1650 <sup>o</sup>C).<ref>Generic Assessment Procedures for Determining Protective Actions During a Reactor Accident, IAEA-TECDOC-955, 1997, p. 173</ref>\n\nBased upon the assumption that a Pressurized water reactor contains 300 tons of [[water]], and that the activity of the fuel of a 1 GWe reactor is as the IAEA predicts,<ref>Generic Assessment Procedures for Determining Protective Actions During a Reactor Accident, IAEA-TECDOC-955, 1997, p. 171</ref> then the coolant activity after an accident such as the [[Three Mile Island accident]] (where a core is uncovered and then recovered with water) can be predicted.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n=====Releases from reprocessing under normal conditions=====\n\nIt is normal to allow used fuel to stand after the irradiation to allow the short-lived and radiotoxic [[iodine]] isotopes to decay away. In one experiment in the US, fresh fuel which had not been allowed to decay was reprocessed (the [[Green run]] [http://www.osti.gov/energycitations/product.biblio.jsp?osti_id=7296321] [https://web.archive.org/web/20060508030806/http://archive.tri-cityherald.com/thyroid/history.html]) to investigate the effects of a large iodine release from the reprocessing of short cooled fuel. It is normal in reprocessing plants to scrub the off gases from the dissolver to prevent the emission of iodine. In addition to the emission of iodine the [[noble gas]]es and [[tritium]] are released from the fuel when it is dissolved. It has been proposed that by voloxidation (heating the fuel in a furnace under oxidizing conditions) the majority of the tritium can be recovered from the fuel.[https://web.archive.org/web/20060307211536/http://www.ornl.gov/~webworks/cppr/y2001/pres/123514.pdf]\n\nA paper was written on the radioactivity in [[oyster]]s found in the [[Irish Sea]].<ref>A. Preston, J.W.R. Dutton and B.R. Harvey, ''Nature'', 1968, '''218''', 689\u2013690.</ref> These were found by gamma spectroscopy to contain <sup>141</sup>Ce, <sup>144</sup>Ce, <sup>103</sup>Ru, <sup>106</sup>Ru, <sup>137</sup>Cs, <sup>95</sup>Zr and <sup>95</sup>Nb. Additionally, a zinc activation product (<sup>65</sup>Zn) was found, which is thought to be due to the corrosion of [[magnox]] fuel cladding in [[spent fuel pool]]s. It is likely that the modern releases of all these isotopes from the [[Sellafield|Windscale]] event is smaller.\n\n===On-load reactors===\nSome reactor designs, such as [[RBMK]]s or [[CANDU reactor]]s, can be refueled without being shut down. This is achieved through the use of many small pressure tubes to contain the fuel and coolant, as opposed to one large pressure vessel as in [[pressurized water reactor]] (PWR) or [[boiling water reactor]] (BWR) designs. Each tube can be individually isolated and refueled by an operator-controlled fueling machine, typically at a rate of up to 8 channels per day out of roughly 400 in CANDU reactors. On-load refueling allows for the '''optimal fuel reloading problem''' to be dealt with continuously, leading to more efficient use of fuel. This increase in efficiency is partially offset by the added complexity of having hundreds of pressure tubes and the fueling machines to service them.\n\n===Interim storage===\nAfter its operating cycle, the reactor is shut down for refueling. The fuel discharged at that time (spent fuel) is stored either at the reactor site (commonly in a [[spent fuel pool]]) or potentially in a common facility away from reactor sites. If on-site pool storage capacity is exceeded, it may be desirable to store the now cooled aged fuel in modular dry storage facilities known as Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installations (ISFSI) at the reactor site or at a facility away from the site. The spent fuel rods are usually stored in water or boric acid, which provides both cooling (the spent fuel continues to generate [[decay heat]] as a result of residual radioactive decay) and shielding to protect the environment from residual [[ionizing radiation]], although after at least a year of cooling they may be moved to [[dry cask storage]].\n\n===Transportation===\n{{Main|Spent nuclear fuel shipping cask}}\n\n===Reprocessing===\n{{Main|Nuclear reprocessing}}\n{{See also|Spent nuclear fuel}}\n\n\nSpent fuel discharged from reactors contains appreciable quantities of fissile (U-235 and Pu-239), fertile (U-238), and other [[radioactive]] materials, including [[nuclear poison|reaction poisons]], which is why the fuel had to be removed. These fissile and fertile materials can be chemically separated and recovered from the spent fuel. The recovered uranium and plutonium can, if economic and institutional conditions permit, be recycled for use as nuclear fuel. This is currently not done for civilian spent nuclear fuel in the [[United States]].\n\nMixed oxide, or [[MOX fuel]], is a blend of [[reprocessed uranium]] and plutonium and depleted uranium which behaves similarly, although not identically, to the enriched uranium feed for which most nuclear reactors were designed. MOX fuel is an alternative to low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel used in the light water reactors which predominate nuclear power generation.\n\nCurrently, plants in Europe are reprocessing spent fuel from utilities in Europe and Japan. Reprocessing of spent commercial-reactor nuclear fuel is currently not permitted in the [[United States]] due to the perceived danger of [[nuclear proliferation]]. The [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush Administration's]] [[Global Nuclear Energy Partnership]] proposed that the U.S. form an international partnership to see spent nuclear fuel reprocessed in a way that renders the plutonium in it usable for nuclear fuel but not for [[nuclear weapon]]s.\n\n===Partitioning and transmutation===\nAs an alternative to the disposal of the [[PUREX raffinate]] in [[glass]] or [[Synroc]] matrix, the most [[radiotoxic]] elements could be removed through advanced reprocessing. After separation, the [[minor actinides]] and some long-lived [[fission product]]s could be converted to short-lived or stable [[isotope]]s by either [[neutron]] or [[photon]] irradiation. This is called [[Nuclear transmutation|transmutation]]. Strong and long-term international cooperation, and many decades of research and huge investments remain necessary before to reach a mature industrial scale where the safety and the economical feasibility of partitioning and transmutation (P&T) could be demonstrated.<ref>{{cite journal\n|last1 = Baetsl\u00e9\n|first1 = L.H.\n|last2 = De Raedt\n|first2 = Ch.\n|title = Limitations of actinide recycle and fuel cycle consequences: a global analysis Part 1: Global fuel cycle analysis\n|journal = Nuclear Engineering and Design\n|volume = 168\n|issue = 1\u20133\n|year = 1997\n|pages = 191\u2013201\n|issn = 0029-5493\n|doi = 10.1016/S0029-5493(96)01374-X\n}}</ref>\n\n===Waste disposal===\n{{actinidesvsfissionproducts}}\n{{Main|Radioactive waste|Spent nuclear fuel}}\nA current concern in the nuclear power field is the safe disposal and isolation of either [[Spent nuclear fuel|spent fuel from reactors]] or, if the reprocessing option is used, wastes from reprocessing plants.

Current plans call for the ultimate disposal of the wastes in solid form in a licensed deep, stable geologic structure called a [[deep geological repository]]. The Department of Energy chose [[Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository|Yucca Mountain]] as the location for the repository. Its opening has been repeatedly delayed. Since 1999 thousands of nuclear waste shipments have been stored at the [[Waste Isolation Pilot Plant]] in New Mexico.\n\n[[Fast-neutron reactor]]s can fission all actinides, while the [[thorium fuel cycle]] produces low levels of [[transuranic]]s. Unlike LWRs, in principle these fuel cycles could recycle their [[plutonium]] and [[minor actinides]] and leave only [[fission product]]s and [[activation product]]s as waste. The highly radioactive [[medium-lived fission product]]s [[Cs-137]] and [[Sr-90]] diminish by a factor of 10 each century; while the [[long-lived fission product]]s have relatively low radioactivity, often compared favorably to that of the original uranium ore.\n\n[[Horizontal drillhole disposal]] describes proposals to drill over one kilometer vertically, and two kilometers horizontally in the earth\u2019s crust, for the purpose of disposing of high-level waste forms such as [[spent nuclear fuel]], [[Caesium-137]], or [[Strontium-90]].

Where plutonium is recycled, it is normally reused once in light water reactors, although fast reactors could lead to more complete recycling of plutonium.<ref>{{cite book |title=Energy and the New Reality 2: Carbon-Free Energy Supply \u2013 section 8.4 |author=Harvey, L.D.D.|isbn=978-1849710732|year=2010|publisher=Earthscan}}</ref>\n\n===Once-through nuclear fuel cycle===\n[[Image:Oncethroughcycle.png|500px|thumb|right|A once through (or open) fuel cycle]]\nNot a cycle ''per se'', fuel is used once and then sent to storage without further processing save additional packaging to provide for better isolation from the [[biosphere]].

Here, the [[fission product]]s, [[minor actinides]], [[activation product]]s, and [[reprocessed uranium]] are separated from the reactor-grade [[plutonium]], which can then be fabricated into [[MOX fuel]]. Because the proportion of the non-[[fissile]] [[even and odd numbers|even]]-[[atomic mass|mass]] [[isotopes of plutonium]] rises with each pass through the cycle, there are currently no plans to reuse plutonium from used MOX fuel for a third pass in a [[thermal reactor]]. If [[fast reactor]]s become available, they may be able to burn these, or almost any other [[actinide]] [[isotope]]s.\n\nThe use of a medium-scale [[Nuclear reprocessing|reprocessing]] facility onsite, and the use of [[pyroprocessing]] rather than the present day aqueous reprocessing, is claimed to considerably reduce the [[Nuclear proliferation|proliferation]] potential or possible diversion of fissile material as the processing facility is [[in-situ]]/integral. Similarly as plutonium is not separated on its own in the pyroprocessing cycle, rather all actinides are \"[[electrowinning|electro-won]]\" or \"refined\" from the spent fuel, the plutonium is never separated on its own, instead it comes over into the new fuel mixed with gamma and alpha emitting actinides, species that \"self-protect\" it in numerous possible thief scenarios.\n\nBeginning in 2016 Russia has been testing and is now deploying [[Remix Fuel]] in which the spent nuclear fuel is put through a process like Pyroprocessing that separates the reactor Grade Plutonium and remaining Uranium from the fission products and fuel cladding. This mixed metal is then combined with a small quantity of medium enriched Uranium with approximately 17% U-235 concentration to make a new combined metal oxide fuel with 1% Reactor Grade plutonium and a U-235 concentration of 4%. These fuel rods are suitable for use in standard PWR reactors as the Plutonium content is no higher than that which exists at the end of cycle in the spent nuclear fuel. As of February 2020 Russia was deploying this fuel in some of their fleet of [[VVER]] reactors. <ref>https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/conversion-enrichment-and-fabrication/fuel-fabrication.aspx#ECSArticleLink5</ref> <ref>https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/REMIX-fuel-pilot-testing-starts-at-Balakovo-reacto</ref>\n\n===Minor actinides recycling===\nIt has been proposed that in addition to the use of plutonium, the [[minor actinide]]s could be used in a critical power reactor. Tests are already being conducted in which [[americium]] is being used as a fuel.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nea.fr/html/pt/docs/iem/jeju02/session3/SessionIII-04.pdf |title= The Preparation of the EFTTRA-T5 Americium Transmutation Experiment |work= Seventh Information Exchange Meeting on Actinide and Fission Product Partitioning and Transmutation |author1=Warin D. |author2=Konings R.J.M |author3=Haas D. |author4=Maritin P. |author5=Bonnerot J-M. |author6=Vambenepe G. |author7=Schram R.P.C. |author8=Kuijper J.C. |author9=Bakker K. |author10=Conrad R. |accessdate= 2008-01-15 |date=October 2002}}</ref>\n\nA number of reactor designs, like the [[Integral Fast Reactor]], have been designed for this rather different fuel cycle. In principle, it should be possible to derive energy from the fission of any actinide nucleus. With a careful reactor design, all the actinides in the fuel can be consumed, leaving only lighter elements with short [[half-life|half-lives]]. Whereas this has been done in prototype plants, no such reactor has ever been operated on a large scale.{{cn|date=May 2017}}\n\nIt so happens that the [[neutron cross-section]] of many actinides decreases with increasing neutron energy, but the ratio of fission to simple activation ([[neutron capture]]) changes in favour of fission as the neutron energy increases. Thus with a sufficiently high neutron energy, it should be possible to destroy even curium without the generation of the transcurium metals. This could be very desirable as it would make it significantly easier to reprocess and handle the actinide fuel.\n\nOne promising alternative from this perspective is an [[accelerator-driven sub-critical reactor]] / [[subcritical reactor]].

In the case of protons, very fast neutrons will spall off the target, while in the case of the electrons, very high energy [[photon]]s will be generated. These high-energy neutrons and photons will then be able to cause the fission of the heavy actinides.\n\nSuch reactors compare very well to other neutron sources in terms of neutron energy:\n\n* Thermal 0 to 100&nbsp;eV\n* Epithermal 100&nbsp;eV to 100&nbsp;keV\n* Fast (from [[nuclear fission]]) 100&nbsp;keV to 3&nbsp;MeV\n* DD [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] 2.5&nbsp;MeV\n* DT fusion 14&nbsp;MeV\n* Accelerator driven core 200&nbsp;MeV (lead driven by 1.6&nbsp;GeV [[proton]]s)\n* [[Muon-catalyzed fusion]] 7&nbsp;GeV.\n\nAs an alternative, the curium-244, with a half-life of 18 years, could be left to decay into plutonium-240 before being used in fuel in a fast reactor.\n\n[[Image:Twincyclefuelcycle.png|thumb|center|853px|A pair of fuel cycles in which uranium and plutonium are kept separate from the minor actinides. The minor actinide cycle is kept within the green box.]]\n\n====Fuel or targets for this actinide transmutation====\nTo date the nature of the fuel (targets) for actinide transformation has not been chosen.\n\nIf actinides are transmuted in a [[Subcritical reactor]], it is likely that the fuel will have to be able to tolerate more thermal cycles than conventional fuel. An accelerator-driven sub-critical reactor is unlikely to be able to maintain a constant operation period for equally long times as a critical reactor, and each time the accelerator stops then the fuel will cool down.\n\nOn the other hand, if actinides are destroyed using a fast reactor, such as an [[Integral Fast Reactor]], then the fuel will most likely not be exposed to many more thermal cycles than in a normal power station.\n\nDepending on the matrix the process can generate more transuranics from the matrix. This could either be viewed as good (generate more fuel) or can be viewed as bad (generation of more ''radiotoxic'' [[transuranic element]]s). A series of different matrices exists which can control this production of heavy actinides.\n\nFissile nuclei (such as <sup>233</sup>U, <sup>235</sup>U, and <sup>239</sup>Pu) respond well to [[delayed neutrons]] and are thus important to keep a critical reactor stable; this limits the amount of minor actinides that can be destroyed in a critical reactor. As a consequence, it is important that the chosen matrix allows the reactor to keep the ratio of fissile to non-fissile nuclei high, as this enables it to destroy the long-lived actinides safely. In contrast, the power output of a sub-critical reactor is limited by the intensity of the driving particle accelerator, and thus it need not contain any uranium or plutonium at all. In such a system, it may be preferable to have an inert matrix that does not produce additional long-lived isotopes.\n\n=====Actinides in an inert matrix=====\nThe actinides will be mixed with a metal which will not form more actinides; for instance, an [[alloy]] of actinides in a solid such as [[zirconia]] could be used.\n\n=====Actinides in a thorium matrix=====\nUpon neutron bombardment, [[thorium]] can be converted to [[uranium-233]]. <sup>233</sup>U is fissile, and has a larger fission cross section than both <sup>235</sup>U and <sup>238</sup>U, and thus it is far less likely to produce higher actinides through neutron capture.\n\n=====Actinides in a uranium matrix=====\nIf the actinides are incorporated into a uranium-metal or uranium-oxide matrix, then the neutron capture of <sup>238</sup>U is likely to generate new plutonium-239. An advantage of mixing the actinides with uranium and plutonium is that the large fission cross sections of <sup>235</sup>U and <sup>239</sup>Pu for the less energetic delayed neutrons could make the reaction stable enough to be carried out in a critical [[fast reactor]], which is likely to be both cheaper and simpler than an accelerator driven system.\n\n=====Mixed matrix=====\nIt is also possible to create a matrix made from a mix of the above-mentioned materials. This is most commonly done in fast reactors where one may wish to keep the breeding ratio of new fuel high enough to keep powering the reactor, but still low enough that the generated actinides can be safely destroyed without transporting them to another site. One way to do this is to use fuel where actinides and uranium is mixed with inert zirconium, producing fuel elements with the desired properties.\n\n===Thorium cycle===\n{{Main|Thorium fuel cycle}}\nIn the thorium fuel cycle [[thorium-232]] absorbs a [[neutron]] in either a fast or thermal reactor. The thorium-233 [[beta decay]]s to [[protactinium]]-233 and then to [[uranium-233]], which in turn is used as fuel. Hence, like [[uranium-238]], thorium-232 is a [[fertile material]].\n:<chem>\\overset{neutron}{n} + ^{232}_{90}Th -> ^{233}_{90}Th ->[\\beta^-] ^{233}_{91}Pa ->[\\beta^-] \\overset{fuel}{^{233}_{92}U}</chem>\nAfter starting the reactor with existing U-233 or some other [[fissile material]] such as [[Uranium-235|U-235]] or [[Pu-239]], a breeding cycle similar to but more efficient<ref name=\"THFUELCYCLE\">See [[thorium fuel cycle]]</ref> than that with U-238 and plutonium can be created. The Th-232 absorbs a neutron to become Th-233 which quickly decays to [[protactinium]]-233. Protactinium-233 in turn decays with a half-life of 27 days to U-233. In some [[molten salt reactor]] designs, the Pa-233 is extracted and protected from neutrons (which could transform it to Pa-234 and then to [[Uranium-234|U-234]]), until it has decayed to U-233. This is done in order to improve the [[breeder reactor#Breeding ratio|breeding ratio]] which is low compared to [[fast reactor]]s.\n\n[[Thorium]] is at least 4-5 times more abundant in nature than all of uranium isotopes combined; thorium is fairly evenly spread around Earth with a lot of countries<ref>See [[Thorium#Occurrence|Thorium occurrence]] for discussion of abundance.</ref>\nhaving huge supplies of it; preparation of thorium fuel does not require difficult\n<ref name=\"THFUELCYCLE\" />\nand expensive enrichment processes; the thorium fuel cycle creates mainly Uranium-233 contaminated with [[Uranium-232]] which makes it harder to use in a normal, pre-assembled nuclear weapon which is stable over long periods of time (unfortunately drawbacks are much lower for immediate use weapons or where final assembly occurs just prior to usage time); elimination of at least the [[transuranic]] portion of the nuclear waste problem is possible in [[Molten-salt reactor|MSR]] and other breeder reactor designs.\n\nOne of the earliest efforts to use a thorium fuel cycle took place at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] in the 1960s. An experimental reactor was built based on [[molten salt reactor]] technology to study the feasibility of such an approach, using [[thorium fluoride]] [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]] kept hot enough to be liquid, thus eliminating the need for fabricating fuel elements.  This effort culminated in the [[Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment]] that used <sup>232</sup>Th as the fertile material and <sup>233</sup>U as the fissile fuel. Due to a lack of funding, the MSR program was discontinued in 1976.\n\n===Current industrial activity===\nCurrently the only isotopes used as nuclear fuel are [[uranium-235]] (U-235), [[uranium-238]] (U-238) and [[plutonium-239]], although the proposed thorium fuel cycle has advantages. Some modern reactors, with minor modifications, can use [[thorium]]. Thorium is approximately three times more abundant in the [[crust (geology)|Earth's crust]] than uranium (and 550 times more abundant than uranium-235). There has been little exploration for thorium resources, and thus the [[proved resource]] is small. [[Thorium]] is more plentiful than [[uranium]] in some countries, notably [[Nuclear power in India | India]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.npcil.nic.in/nupower_vol11_1-3/chidambaram.htm |title= Towards an Energy Independent India |year= 1997 | author=  Chidambaram R. |work= Nu-Power |publisher= Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited |accessdate= 2008-01-15 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071217050844/http://www.npcil.nic.in/nupower_vol11_1-3/chidambaram.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-12-17}}</ref>\n\n[[Heavy water reactor]]s and graphite-moderated reactors can use [[natural uranium]], but the vast majority of the world's reactors require [[enriched uranium]], in which the ratio of U-235 to U-238 is increased.

Despite his conversion to Calvinism he was never trusted by the Scots and returned to France where he ended his days. Sir James Melville described him as \"of nature upright, just and gentle\". He was the first to popularise the firstname [[Esm\u00e9]] (spelled also Edme,<ref>Gaspard Thaumas de la Thaumassiere, ''Histoire de Berry'', Paris, 1689, pp.697-702[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TR1UAAAAcAAJ&pg=RA1-PA697&lpg=RA1-PA697&dq=Aubigny+et+ses+seigneurs:+les+Stuart+de+Lennox&source=bl&ots=C47PB2e3eh&sig=ACfU3U34BX8QruV-MQ1FfMVKVg-yRcsLrQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi5sd73jYvoAhWGO8AKHW2aAl4Q6AEwDnoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=Aubigny%20et%20ses%20seigneurs%3A%20les%20Stuart%20de%20Lennox&f=false]</ref> etc, he signed his name as \"Amy\",<ref>[[GEC Complete Peerage]], vol.7, p.604, note (a)</ref> meaning \"beloved\" (aim\u00e9)) in the British Isles.\n\n==Origins==\nHe was the son and heir of John Stewart, 5th [[Seigneur d'Aubigny]] (d.1567) (a  younger son of [[John Stewart, 3rd Earl of Lennox]]) by his wife Anne de la Queuille, a French noblewoman. His father had inherited (through adoption from his great uncle Sir [[Robert Stewart, 4th Lord of Aubigny|Robert Stewart, 4th Seigneur d'Aubigny]] (c.1470\u20131544)), the French Seigneurie ([[lord of the manor|lordship of the manor]]) of Aubigny and its estates, including the [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Aubigny]] at [[Aubigny-sur-N\u00e8re]] in the ancient [[Provinces of France|province]] of [[Berry, France|Berry]], central France, built by him, also the nearby secondary seat of [[Ch\u00e2teau de la Verrerie (Cher)|Ch\u00e2teau de la Verrerie]].\n\n==Career==\nHe spent much of his life in [[France]] and succeeded his father as 6th Seigneur d'Aubigny in 1567. At the age of 37 he came to Scotland, where he was introduced to his first cousin once removed, the 13-year-old [[James I of England|James VI of Scotland]], when the latter made his [[Entry of James VI into Edinburgh|formal entry into Edinburgh]] and began his personal rule. Esm\u00e9 was an exotic visitor who fascinated the young James,> who began to shower him with rewards and preferments.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=zC74dutk7bQC&pg=PT860&lpg=PT860&dq=Esm%C3%A9+Stewart,+1st+Duke+of+Lennox&source=bl&ots=hVTx8NgqWk&sig=RqKlMtz19SgFG1CCa-gWtPuh_Dw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=TwyRU9bIEcWcyAScuYCYDQ&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAjgU#v=onepage&q=Esm%C3%A9%20Stewart%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Lennox&f=false ''A Dictionary of British History'', ed. John Ashton Cannon, (Oxford, 2009)] {{ISBN|9780199550388}}</ref> He was appointed to the [[Privy Council of Scotland]], was created [[Earl of Lennox]] on 5 March 1580 (which title having been inherited by King James from his paternal grandfather had merged into the crown), and then [[Duke of Lennox]] on 5 August 1581. He was also created [[Earl of Darnley]], Lords Tarboulton and Dalkeith and received other favours.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=420}} During his rise he was careful to maintain his popularity with the Burgh administrators of Scotland's towns. For example in July 1580 the English diplomat [[Robert Bowes (diplomat)|Robert Bowes]] reported that Lennox had obtained fishing rights in [[Aberdeen]], which the deposed [[James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton|Regent Morton]] had given to his servant George Auchinleck of Balmanno, and had then arranged for the King to give this valuable source of income to the town.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 5 (1907), p. 461, no. 536.</ref>\n\nIn [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] Scotland, the thought of a Catholic duke irked many, and Lennox had to make a choice between his Catholic faith and his loyalty to the king. Lennox chose the latter, who taught him the doctrines of [[Calvinism]]. Neverthess the [[Church of Scotland]] remained suspicious of Lennox after his public conversion and took alarm when he had the Earl of Morton tried and beheaded on charges of [[treason]].\n\n==Ruthven Raid and exile==\nIn response the Scottish nobles plotted to oust Lennox. They did so by luring James to [[Huntingtower Castle|Ruthven Castle]] as a guest where they kept him as prisoner for ten months. The Lord Enterprisers then forced James to banish Lennox. A lengthy denunciation of Lennox was issued from [[Stirling Castle]] on 17 September 1582, citing his religion, association with the murderers of [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley]] (King James's father) and [[Regent Moray]] and [[Regent Lennox]] and his control over the royal household and international intrigue.<ref>''Calendar of State Papers Scotland'', vol. 6 (Edinburgh, 1910), pp. 171-174.</ref> Lennox stayed for a while at [[Dumbarton Castle]]. In December whilst travelling south from [[Berwick on Tweed]], by chance near [[Northallerton]] he encountered the French ambassador, M. de la Mothe F\u00e9nelon, who was travelling northward to treat with the [[Raid of Ruthven|Gowrie Regime]]. In London the Scottish poet [[William Fowler (makar)|William Fowler]] pumped Lennox for information which he sent to [[Francis Walsingham]].<ref>''Calendar of State Papers Scotland'', vol. 6 (Edinburgh, 1910), pp. 235, 240-3, 256-7, 262-3, 265-6.</ref>\n\n==Return to France==\nLennox returned to France where he started a secret correspondence with King James. He met a frosty reception in France as an [[apostate]]. Although the Scottish nobles believed that they would be proved right in their belief that Lennox's conversion was artificial following his return France, he remained a Presbyterian.\n\n==Death in Paris==\nHe died in Paris on 26 May 1583. His final letter to [[James Stewart, 1st Lord Doune|James Stewart, Lord Doune]], requested him to take care of his son and to recover his former possessions in Scotland for his benefit.<ref>''HMC 6th Report: Earl of Moray'' (London, 1877), p. 637, (Letter dated Paris NS, 4 June 1583).</ref> [[William Schaw]] took his heart back to King James in Scotland, followed by his wife and eldest son Ludovic Stewart. King James had repeatedly vouched for Lennox's religious sincerity and memorialized him in a poem called \"Ane Tragedie of the Phoenix\", which compared him to an exotic bird of unique beauty killed by envy. King James I regarded all Lennox's family with great affection, and instructed his son King Charles I to do well by them. Charles faithfully fulfilled this obligation, and as a result the Lennox family had considerable influence at the Scottish and English Courts over the next two generations.\n\n==Marriage & issue==\nIn about 1572 he married Catherine de Balsac (d.post-1630), a daughter of Guillaume de Balsac, Sieur d'Entragues, by his wife Louise d'Humi\u00e8res. Catherine outlived her husband by many years and  spent her later life at the family estate at Aubigny, where she was entrusted with  the upbringing of her grandchildren.

His father had inherited (through adoption from his great uncle Sir [[Robert Stewart, 4th Lord of Aubigny|Robert Stewart, 4th Seigneur d'Aubigny]] (c.1470\u20131544)), the French Seigneurie ([[lord of the manor|lordship of the manor]]) of Aubigny and its estates, including the [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Aubigny]] at [[Aubigny-sur-N\u00e8re]] in the ancient [[Provinces of France|province]] of [[Berry, France|Berry]], central France, built by him, also the nearby secondary seat of [[Ch\u00e2teau de la Verrerie (Cher)|Ch\u00e2teau de la Verrerie]].\n\n==Career==\nHe spent much of his life in [[France]] and succeeded his father as 6th Seigneur d'Aubigny in 1567.

He was also created [[Earl of Darnley]], Lords Tarboulton and Dalkeith and received other favours.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=420}} During his rise he was careful to maintain his popularity with the Burgh administrators of Scotland's towns. For example in July 1580 the English diplomat [[Robert Bowes (diplomat)|Robert Bowes]] reported that Lennox had obtained fishing rights in [[Aberdeen]], which the deposed [[James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton|Regent Morton]] had given to his servant George Auchinleck of Balmanno, and had then arranged for the King to give this valuable source of income to the town.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 5 (1907), p. 461, no. 536.</ref>\n\nIn [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] Scotland, the thought of a Catholic duke irked many, and Lennox had to make a choice between his Catholic faith and his loyalty to the king. Lennox chose the latter, who taught him the doctrines of [[Calvinism]]. Neverthess the [[Church of Scotland]] remained suspicious of Lennox after his public conversion and took alarm when he had the Earl of Morton tried and beheaded on charges of [[treason]].\n\n==Ruthven Raid and exile==\nIn response the Scottish nobles plotted to oust Lennox. They did so by luring James to [[Huntingtower Castle|Ruthven Castle]] as a guest where they kept him as prisoner for ten months. The Lord Enterprisers then forced James to banish Lennox. A lengthy denunciation of Lennox was issued from [[Stirling Castle]] on 17 September 1582, citing his religion, association with the murderers of [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley]] (King James's father) and [[Regent Moray]] and [[Regent Lennox]] and his control over the royal household and international intrigue.<ref>''Calendar of State Papers Scotland'', vol. 6, (1910), 171-174.</ref> Lennox stayed for a while at [[Dumbarton Castle]].

He met a frosty reception in France as an [[apostate]]. Although the Scottish nobles believed that they would be proved right in their belief that Lennox's conversion was artificial following his return France, he remained a Presbyterian.\n\n==Death in Paris==\nHe died in Paris on 26 May 1583. His final letter to [[James Stewart, 1st Lord Doune|James Stewart, Lord Doune]], requested him to take care of his son and to recover his former possessions in Scotland for his benefit.<ref>''HMC 6th Report: Earl of Moray'' (London, 1877), p. 637, (Letter dated Paris NS, 4 June 1583).</ref> [[William Schaw]] took his heart back to King James in Scotland, followed by his wife and eldest son Ludovic Stewart. King James had repeatedly vouched for Lennox's religious sincerity and memorialized him in a poem called \"Ane Tragedie of the Phoenix\", which compared him to an exotic bird of unique beauty killed by envy. King James I regarded all Lennox's family with great affection, and instructed his son King Charles I to do well by them. Charles faithfully fulfilled this obligation, and as a result the Lennox family had considerable influence at the Scottish and English Courts over the next two generations.\n\n==Marriage & issue==\nIn about 1572 he married Catherine de Balsac (d.post-1630), a daughter of Guillaume de Balsac, Sieur d'Entragues, by his wife Louise d'Humi\u00e8res. Catherine outlived her husband by many years and  spent her later life at the family estate at Aubigny, where she was entrusted with  the upbringing of her grandchildren.

The idea of developing treaties for Blackfoot lands was brought to a Blackfoot chief named [[Crowfoot]] by [[John Chantler McDougall|John McDougall]] in 1875.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/treaty-7/|title=Treaty 7|last=Tesar|first=Alex|date=August 9, 2016|website=The Canadian Encyclopedia|access-date=February 5, 2018}}</ref> It was concluded on September 22, 1877. The agreement was signed at the [[Blackfoot Crossing]] of the [[Bow River]], at the present-day [[Siksika Nation]] reserve, approximately {{Convert|100|km|abbr=on}} east of [[Calgary, Alberta]]. Chief Crowfoot was one of the signatories to Treaty 7. Another signing on this treaty occurred on December 4, 1877 to accommodate some Blackfoot leaders who were not present at the primary September 1877 signing.\n\nTreaty 7 is one of 11 [[Numbered Treaties]] signed between First Nations and [[the Crown]] between 1871 and 1921. The treaty established a delimited area of land for the tribes (a [[Indian reserve|reserve]]), promised annual payments and/or provisions from the Queen to the tribes and promised continued hunting and trapping rights on the \"tract surrendered\". In exchange, the tribes ceded their rights to their traditional territory, of which they had earlier been recognized as the owners.\n\nBritain had transferred whatever jurisdiction over \"Indians and lands reserved for the Indians\" it may have had to the [[Province of Canada]] in the 1840s. This authority devolved to the federal government at [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] in 1867 and would have applied to the area of the [[North-Western Territory]] and [[Rupert's Land]] that came into the Canadian Confederation in 1870, including the part that became Alberta in 1905. The British government, in an exchange of letters at the time of the transfer of the NWT, sought assurances that Canada would provide the Crown's obligation to First Nations. \n[[File:Treaty medals, Indian Treaty No. 7, 1877, brass - Glenbow Museum - DSC01079.JPG|thumb|A brass medal commemorating the treaty in the [[Glenbow Museum]], 1877.]]\n\n==List of the Treaty 7 First Nations==\n* [[Bearspaw First Nation]] ([[Nakoda (Stoney)|Stoney First Nation]]/[[Nakota|Nakoda]])\n* [[Chiniki First Nation]] (Stoney First Nation/Nakoda)\n* [[Kainai Nation|Blood Tribe (Kainai Nation)]] ([[Blackfoot Confederacy|Blackfoot]])\n* [[Piikani Nation]] (Blackfoot)\n* [[Siksika Nation]] (Blackfoot)\n* [[Tsuut'ina Nation]] (Sarcee)\n* [[Wesley First Nation]] (Stoney First Nation/Nakoda)\n\n== Context  ==\nIn the late 1800s, five indigenous nations were situated along the southern parts of western Canada. The five nations were the Blackfoot, Peigans, Sarcee and Crees and Blood. They were nomadic populations, which allowed them to move freely following the buffalo herds from which they gained a lot of their resources and were able to live. The 5 Nations owned their lands and used them for hunting grounds as well as for settlement areas. Their territories started in the southern parts of Alberta and Saskatchewan as well as northern Montana. These plains included vast buffalo hunting which allowed them to sustain themselves and their culture. Buffalo were the foundation of not only the economy of the people of the plains but also of their culture and way of life. The buffalo provided the people of the plains with food, clothing and warmth, fuel and sacred objects. The buffalo were a pivotal part of their way of life and greatly diminished due to overhunting in the plains. By 1879, the buffalo could no longer be found in any significant numbers across the plains leading the people to have different needs and require other ways of life.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/g4/11/780973431612_13244st.pdf|title=Compact, Contract, Covenant|last=Miller|first=J.r}}</ref>\n\nThe Canadian government wanted to build a railway but in order to proceed, they had to acquire the land from the Indigenous people. The government brought forward the idea of a treaty to the Indigenous people who resided on the land on the plains that was needed for the railway. There were already treaties in place between other Indigenous groups and the government. This would be the 7th treaty.\n\nA series of 11 treaties made between the Canadian government and Indigenous peoples from 1871 to 1921. The Indigenous groups in the west were involved in treaties 1-7 which took place between 1871 and 1877.<ref name=\":0\" /> The Treaties covered the area between the Lake of the Woods (northern Ontario, southern Manitoba) to the Rocky Mountains (northeastern British Columbia and interior Plains of Alberta) to the Beaufort Sea (north of Yukon and the Northwest Territories).\n\nThe leaders of the plains were interested in signing the treaty because they had concerns about the course of their lives. People had become aware that their resources were rapidly depleting due to overhunting and commercialization of the usage of animals with the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company. Diseases such as smallpox that were taking lives of the old, young and children and it was becoming increasingly more difficult to control disease as it spread easily throughout communities where there wasn't immunity to these foreign disease. The plains people and their leaders were also concerned about their future and culture and what the influx of American settlers and traders would mean for their communities.<ref name=\":0\" /> They saw the number treaties as an association with the monarchy and as a way for them to gain the government's protection of their land and resources before American settlers came to take over their territories. They were able to trust that the Queen and her people would keep their word because the Canadian Mounties had done well in keeping American traders out of Southern Alberta.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Signing Day: Negotiations / Treaty Terms  ==\nThe seventh Treaty was signed in September 1877 between the Canadian government and the five First Nations: the Siksika (Blackfoot), Kainai (Blood), Piikani (Peigan), Stoney-Nakoda, and Tsuut\u2019ina (Sarcee). Treaty seven was the last of a series of treaties that were signed during the 1870\u2019s.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100028789/1100100028791|title=Treaty Research Report - Treaty Seven (1877)|last=Branch|first=Government of Canada; Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada; Communications|website=www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-03-29}}</ref> It would be the last treaty signed between the Government and the First Nations for the next 20 years.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=The Great Blackfoot Treaties|last=Dempsey|first=Hugh A.|publisher=Heritage House Publishing Company|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> This series of treaties during the 1870\u2019s between the Canadian Government and the First Nation people was to determine the division of land.<ref name=\":2\" /> The negotiations of the treaty took place between lieutenant-governor of the North-West Territories, David Laird and James Macleod, commissioner of NWMP who were representing the Canadian Government. The First Nations representatives were largely from the Blackfoot confederacy due to their inhabiting the majority of the land being sought after. The First Nations' representative was the Blackfoot nation who sent Crowfoot to make the negotiations on their behalf. The signing of the treaty took place at the Blackfoot crossing, a location on their territory. This location was a bit problematic for some of the other nations due to it being quite far from their hunting grounds. The distance factor led to the meeting to discuss the negotiations being pushed back by two days. The treaty commissioners, David Laird and James Macleod arrived September 16 along with the Siksika, Stoney-Nakoda and Tsuut\u2019ina.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca.cat1.lib.trentu.ca:8080/en/article/treaty-7/|title=Treaty 7|last=Tesar|first=Alex}}</ref> They all agreed to wait two days for the remaining nations to arrive. On September 19 the negotiations began between the commissioners and the Five nations. David Laird and James Macleod who were representing the Canadian government began their side of the negotiations with stating the facts about the decline in the buffalo population and how he proposed to help the Indigenous people by introducing new laws to protect the buffalo. The importance of the buffalo to the Indigenous people was high due to their dependence on the buffalo for food. David Laird proposed new laws to protect the buffalo along with helping and teaching the Indigenous people how to learn more about agriculture and ranching that would allow a way to transition from becoming less dependent on the buffalo.<ref name=\":3\" /> David Laird stated to the Indigenous people that the buffalo would soon be gone and it was important for them to move into agriculture and ranching lifestyles and that the government would support them for doing this. There was also discussion surround annual payments, reserve land and education. The Indigenous leaders and their nations were greatly concerned about continuing to be able to hunt and fish across all of the land. Crowfoot waited for the arrival of Red Crow, the leader of the Kainai Nation and a trusted friend of James Macleod before making any decisions with the treaty. Once Red Crow arrived Crowfoot explained to him to the best of his abilities about what he believed the treaty to be about. Once Crowfoot explained to Red Crow, to the best of his abilities, about the treaty and its terms, the treaty was agreed upon by all the leaders and was signed on September 22, 1877.<ref name=\":1\" />  The treaty involved 130,00&nbsp;km of land stretching from the Rocky Mountains to the Cypress Hills, the Red Deer River and the US border. The terms of the treaty stated that all nations still maintained the right to hunt on the land and in exchange for giving up the land each nation was to receive \u201c land equal to 2.59 m2 per family of five and in proportion to that number depending on whether the family was larger or smaller\u201d.<ref name=\":3\" /> Along with the exchange of land an immediate payment was given to every man, woman and child and the promise of annual payments of 25 dollars to the nations chief.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.canadiancrown.com/uploads/3/8/4/1/3841927/treaty_7.pdf|title=Copy of Treaty 7|last=Dunhamel|first=Roger}}</ref> The government also agreed to pay the salaries of the teachers on the reserves. The last agreement was that each family would be given livestock proportion to their family size. These were the terms agreed upon in exchange for the Indigenous people's land. There is very strong evidence to support that the Indigenous people did not understand that they were surrendering their land to the government.\n\n== Content (After Negotiations)  ==\nThe government wanted the land for the purposes of building a railroad through western Canada as the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company was in need of more permanent means of transportation of goods. The written treaty covered roughly 130,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of land from the Rocky Mountains to the west, the Cypress Hills to the east, the Red Deer River to the north, and the US border to the south. Through the treaty all nations retained the right to use the land for hunting. However, due to their rapidly depleting population of buffalo, the Indigenous people wanted to learn more about agriculture and how to cultivate their own produce seeing as how they would be more sedentary without the buffalo herds.  The government brought money, cattle and the promise of education with the intention of teaching Indigenous people the Western ways of living so that they would be able to sustain their populations without the buffalo.\n\nOpinions on what the treaties mean differ across groups. Government officials have been cited as saying that the treaties were contracts allowing the Canadian government to take control of Indigenous lands in return for other types of compensation.<ref name=\":0\" /> Indigenous people thought that the Treaties were a way to allow for a connection to be established between the Indigenous people and the newcomers to Canada through the crown. Their interpretation of the treaties were guided by their need for support from the crown and protection to ensure the survival of their people and culture.<ref name=\":0\" /> Indigenous people did not support the viewpoint of the Canadian government as they found it to be narrow minded and restrictive when they felt as though they were looking for a broader sense of financial and general support for their people.<ref name=\":0\" /> The Indigenous people viewed the treaty as a covenant. The Canadian government viewed it as a contract. The difference between a contract and a covenant is that a covenant is conceived under a deity and therefore has a spiritual context and boundedness that includes a higher power as not only a participant but also a guarantor.<ref name=\":0\" /> It was not surprising that the Indigenous people viewed Treaties as covenants based on their previous relationships with fur traders of the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company and how their interactions were founded on a basis of religion and mutual respect for a higher power and their land.\n\nThe treaty outlined specifics as to rights of Indigenous people and support and protection of the Queen. These included rights that Indigenous people could hunt and fish and had provisions on their land. Their lands would be divided into one square mile for each family of five people (this would be made smaller or larger depending on family size). The treaty outlined the rivers that each Indigenous band could use including their shipments, docking and any other uses for the rivers. Twelve dollars from the Queen was designated to each person who was part of any other of the above-mentioned tribes and other amounts of money to people of higher power such as chiefs. Each nation would receive 2000 dollars every year for the benefit of the tribe so long as it is necessary. Every three years the chiefs would be recognized by way of medals, flags or suits. The Queen would pay for teachers when children on reserves desired teachers and there was a means for education. The treaty dictated the amount of cows per family depending on the number of persons. And finally, the Queen reserved the right to punish any \u201cIndian\u201d who would find themselves in violation of the treaty.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Implications at the time ==\nThe implications at the time of the treaty were seen in two different ways, through the government's point of view and the Indigenous peoples' point of view. The Canadian government wanted the treaty to take place to allow them to build the railway across Canada. It was required that the railway went through the Indigenous peoples' land. The Canadian government began the treaty talks to build the railway and for the expansion of settlement. The immediate responses after the treaty was signed from the Canadian government officials was that \u201csince the treaty the Indians appeared more contented and friendly than ever\u201d.<ref name=\":1\" /> The government's main concern was about the Canadian Pacific Railway and that it would be built. The construction began in the 1880s and it was completed. The implications for the government of Canada have not been seen until more recent years as it has been trying to reconcile with the Indigenous people of Canada.\n\nThe implications for the Indigenous people after the signing of the treaty are seen through their suffering and hardship. The buffalo disappeared more rapidly than expected and the promised support from the Canadian government to transition into a agriculture lifestyle did not happen as quickly and as many expected. The winters following the signing of treaty seven were very harsh on the Indigenous people and their nomadic lifestyle.<ref name=\":2\" /> The nations were still waiting on the government to state what land they will be able to claim. They suffered through disease outbreaks and starvation. Once the nations received the land they were given, it largely was unsuitable. The reserves led to poverty, food shortages and residential schools.<ref name=\":3\" />  Missionaries arrived to provide day schools and residential schools on the reserves.  Issues arose with the reserves that included the lack of space for the number of people, fears the Canadian Pacific Railway would be constructed on their new land and that the land was insufficient and unsuitable.<ref name=\":3\" /> These were the main concerns of the Treaty Seven tribes. The Treaty Seven tribes had been given their reserves and plenty of aid from the missionaries but the promised help from the government that was stated in the treaty would take years to fully receive.\n\n== Legacy : Different Interpretations ==\nThe legacy and effects of the treaties that were signed in the 1870s can still be seen today. Treaty seven was the last treaty signed between the government of Canada and the Plains First Nations for 20 years. A lot of controversy has arisen surrounding these treaties due to the differences in oral and written cultures and the fact that the Indigenous people most likely did not understand that they were surrendering their land to the government. It is largely agreed upon that the Indigenous people that were involved in the signing of the treaty did not understand that they were surrendering their land to the Canadian government.<ref name=\":2\" /> Many people believe that if the Indigenous people involved had fully understood what they were agreeing to and the implications, they would have not agreed and signed these treaties. The treaties did not have a large positive impact on the Indigenous peoples lives as it was thought that they would. Certain nations continued to trespass on other Nations land to hunt. The buffalo disappeared at a faster rate than expected and the settlers continued to arrive at an increasing rate. The promised support that the Canadian government had stated and implied about the transition from a nomadic lifestyle to an agricultural one did not occur. The reserves that the Nations were relocated to had very unsuitable land for the new agriculture lifestyle that they were supposed to be transitioning into.<ref name=\":2\" /> The level of poverty and hardship grew rapidly amongst the Nations on the reserves. The effects of residential schools continue to be seen among the Indigenous people today. The difference in oral and written culture during the time of the treaty signing also greatly impacted the legacy of these treaties due to the ability of the Nations' fully understanding and comprehending what was being surrendered. The settlers at the time strongly advocated for the treaty to be a written document but the tradition of the Indigenous people was and still is an oral one. It is strongly believed by many people in the Nations today that due to the treaty being a written document that there were other negotiations made but excluded from the written document which also persuaded the Nations to sign the treaty. The cultural and language differences had the biggest impact on the treaty and how it has affected the Indigenous people in the long run. The lasting impacts of these treaties are seen today. In 1982 in the Canadian Constitution, the government provided protection to the Indigenous people and the treaty rights of the Indigenous people of Canada.<ref name=\":1\" /> The Canadian government has been attempting to reconcile with the Indigenous people of Canada since it became more apparent of the mistreatment of the Indigenous people of Canada.

The idea of developing treaties for Blackfoot lands was brought to a Blackfoot chief named [[Crowfoot]] by [[John Chantler McDougall|John McDougall]] in 1875.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/treaty-7/|title=Treaty 7|last=Tesar|first=Alex|date=August 9, 2016|website=The Canadian Encyclopedia|access-date=February 5, 2018}}</ref> It was concluded on September 22, 1877. The agreement was signed at the [[Blackfoot Crossing]] of the [[Bow River]], at the present-day [[Siksika Nation]] reserve, approximately {{Convert|100|km|abbr=on}} east of [[Calgary, Alberta]]. Chief Crowfoot was one of the signatories to Treaty 7. Another signing on this treaty occurred on December 4, 1877 to accommodate some Blackfoot leaders who were not present at the primary September 1877 signing.\n\nTreaty 7 is one of 11 [[Numbered Treaties]] signed between First Nations and [[the Crown]] between 1871 and 1921. The treaty established a delimited area of land for the tribes (a [[Indian reserve|reserve]]), promised annual payments and/or provisions from the Queen to the tribes and promised continued hunting and trapping rights on the \"tract surrendered\". In exchange, the tribes ceded their rights to their traditional territory, of which they had earlier been recognized as the owners.\n\nBritain had transferred whatever jurisdiction over \"Indians and lands reserved for the Indians\" it may have had to the [[Province of Canada]] in the 1840s. This authority devolved to the federal government at [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] in 1867 and would have applied to the area of the [[North-Western Territory]] and [[Rupert's Land]] that came into the Canadian Confederation in 1870, including the part that became Alberta in 1905. The British government, in an exchange of letters at the time of the transfer of the NWT, sought assurances that Canada would provide the Crown's obligation to First Nations. \n[[File:Treaty medals, Indian Treaty No. 7, 1877, brass - Glenbow Museum - DSC01079.JPG|thumb|A brass medal commemorating the treaty in the [[Glenbow Museum]], 1877.]]\n\n==List of the Treaty 7 First Nations==\n* [[Bearspaw First Nation]] ([[Nakoda (Stoney)|Stoney First Nation]]/[[Nakota|Nakoda]])\n* [[Chiniki First Nation]] (Stoney First Nation/Nakoda)\n* [[Kainai Nation|Blood Tribe (Kainai Nation)]] ([[Blackfoot Confederacy|Blackfoot]])\n* [[Piikani Nation]] (Blackfoot)\n* [[Siksika Nation]] (Blackfoot)\n* [[Tsuut'ina Nation]] (Sarcee)\n* [[Wesley First Nation]] (Stoney First Nation/Nakoda)\n\n== Context  ==\nIn the late 1800s, five indigenous nations were situated along the southern parts of western Canada. The five nations were the Blackfoot, Peigans, Sarcee and Crees and Blood. They were nomadic populations, which allowed them to move freely following the buffalo herds from which they gained a lot of their resources and were able to live. The 5 Nations owned their lands and used them for hunting grounds as well as for settlement areas. Their territories started in the southern parts of Alberta and Saskatchewan as well as northern Montana. These plains included vast buffalo hunting which allowed them to sustain themselves and their culture. Buffalo were the foundation of not only the economy of the people of the plains but also of their culture and way of life. The buffalo provided the people of the plains with food, clothing and warmth, fuel and sacred objects. The buffalo were a pivotal part of their way of life and greatly diminished due to overhunting in the plains. By 1879, the buffalo could no longer be found in any significant numbers across the plains leading the people to have different needs and require other ways of life.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/g4/11/780973431612_13244st.pdf|title=Compact, Contract, Covenant|last=Miller|first=J.r}}</ref>\n\nThe Canadian government wanted to build a railway but in order to proceed, they had to acquire the land from the Indigenous people. The government brought forward the idea of a treaty to the Indigenous people who resided on the land on the plains that was needed for the railway. There were already treaties in place between other Indigenous groups and the government. This would be the 7th treaty.\n\nA series of 11 treaties made between the Canadian government and Indigenous peoples from 1871 to 1921. The Indigenous groups in the west were involved in treaties 1-7 which took place between 1871 and 1877.<ref name=\":0\" /> The Treaties covered the area between the Lake of the Woods (northern Ontario, southern Manitoba) to the Rocky Mountains (northeastern British Columbia and interior Plains of Alberta) to the Beaufort Sea (north of Yukon and the Northwest Territories).\n\nThe leaders of the plains were interested in signing the treaty because they had concerns about the course of their lives. People had become aware that their resources were rapidly depleting due to overhunting and commercialization of the usage of animals with the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company. Diseases such as smallpox that were taking lives of the old, young and children and it was becoming increasingly more difficult to control disease as it spread easily throughout communities where there wasn't immunity to these foreign disease. The plains people and their leaders were also concerned about their future and culture and what the influx of American settlers and traders would mean for their communities.<ref name=\":0\" /> They saw the number treaties as an association with the monarchy and as a way for them to gain the government's protection of their land and resources before American settlers came to take over their territories. They were able to trust that the Queen and her people would keep their word because the Canadian Mounties had done well in keeping American traders out of Southern Alberta.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Signing Day: Negotiations / Treaty Terms  ==\nThe seventh Treaty was signed in September 1877 between the Canadian government and the five First Nations: the Siksika (Blackfoot), Kainai (Blood), Piikani (Peigan), Stoney-Nakoda, and Tsuut\u2019ina (Sarcee). Treaty seven was the last of a series of treaties that were signed during the 1870\u2019s.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100028789/1100100028791|title=Treaty Research Report - Treaty Seven (1877)|last=Branch|first=Government of Canada; Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada; Communications|website=www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-03-29}}</ref> It would be the last treaty signed between the Government and the First Nations for the next 20 years.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=The Great Blackfoot Treaties|last=Dempsey|first=Hugh A.|publisher=Heritage House Publishing Company|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> This series of treaties during the 1870\u2019s between the Canadian Government and the First Nation people was to determine the division of land.<ref name=\":2\" /> The negotiations of the treaty took place between lieutenant-governor of the North-West Territories, David Laird and James Macleod, commissioner of NWMP who were representing the Canadian Government. The First Nations representatives were largely from the Blackfoot confederacy due to their inhabiting the majority of the land being sought after. The First Nations' representative was the Blackfoot nation who sent Crowfoot to make the negotiations on their behalf. The signing of the treaty took place at the Blackfoot crossing, a location on their territory. This location was a bit problematic for some of the other nations due to it being quite far from their hunting grounds. The distance factor led to the meeting to discuss the negotiations being pushed back by two days. The treaty commissioners, David Laird and James Macleod arrived September 16 along with the Siksika, Stoney-Nakoda and Tsuut\u2019ina.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca.cat1.lib.trentu.ca:8080/en/article/treaty-7/|title=Treaty 7|last=Tesar|first=Alex}}</ref> They all agreed to wait two days for the remaining nations to arrive. On September 19 the negotiations began between the commissioners and the Five nations. David Laird and James Macleod who were representing the Canadian government began their side of the negotiations with stating the facts about the decline in the buffalo population and how he proposed to help the Indigenous people by introducing new laws to protect the buffalo. The importance of the buffalo to the Indigenous people was high due to their dependence on the buffalo for food. David Laird proposed new laws to protect the buffalo along with helping and teaching the Indigenous people how to learn more about agriculture and ranching that would allow a way to transition from becoming less dependent on the buffalo.<ref name=\":3\" /> David Laird stated to the Indigenous people that the buffalo would soon be gone and it was important for them to move into agriculture and ranching lifestyles and that the government would support them for doing this. There was also discussion surround annual payments, reserve land and education. The Indigenous leaders and their nations were greatly concerned about continuing to be able to hunt and fish across all of the land. Crowfoot waited for the arrival of Red Crow, the leader of the Kainai Nation and a trusted friend of James Macleod before making any decisions with the treaty. Once Red Crow arrived Crowfoot explained to him to the best of his abilities about what he believed the treaty to be about. Once Crowfoot explained to Red Crow, to the best of his abilities, about the treaty and its terms, the treaty was agreed upon by all the leaders and was signed on September 22, 1877.<ref name=\":1\" />  The treaty involved 130,00&nbsp;km of land stretching from the Rocky Mountains to the Cypress Hills, the Red Deer River and the US border. The terms of the treaty stated that all nations still maintained the right to hunt on the land and in exchange for giving up the land each nation was to receive \u201c land equal to 2.59 m2 per family of five and in proportion to that number depending on whether the family was larger or smaller\u201d.<ref name=\":3\" /> Along with the exchange of land an immediate payment was given to every man, woman and child and the promise of annual payments of 25 dollars to the nations chief.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.canadiancrown.com/uploads/3/8/4/1/3841927/treaty_7.pdf|title=Copy of Treaty 7|last=Dunhamel|first=Roger}}</ref> The government also agreed to pay the salaries of the teachers on the reserves. The last agreement was that each family would be given livestock proportion to their family size. These were the terms agreed upon in exchange for the Indigenous people's land. There is very strong evidence to support that the Indigenous people did not understand that they were surrendering their land to the government.\n\n== Content (After Negotiations)  ==\nThe government wanted the land for the purposes of building a railroad through western Canada as the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company was in need of more permanent means of transportation of goods. The written treaty covered roughly 130,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of land from the Rocky Mountains to the west, the Cypress Hills to the east, the Red Deer River to the north, and the US border to the south. Through the treaty all nations retained the right to use the land for hunting. However, due to their rapidly depleting population of buffalo, the Indigenous people wanted to learn more about agriculture and how to cultivate their own produce seeing as how they would be more sedentary without the buffalo herds.  The government brought money, cattle and the promise of education with the intention of teaching Indigenous people the Western ways of living so that they would be able to sustain their populations without the buffalo.\n\nOpinions on what the treaties mean differ across groups.

''Adventure Time'' follows the adventures of [[Finn the Human|Finn]] (voiced by [[Jeremy Shada]]), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother [[Jake the Dog|Jake]] (voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]), a dog with magical powers to change shape, and grow and shrink at will. In this limited event series, which itself follows the events of the ''[[Islands (miniseries)|Islands]]'' miniseries, Finn, Jake, and [[List of Adventure Time characters#BMO|BMO]] return home to discover that Ooo (i.e. the magical land in which they live) has been turned into a veritable dystopia thanks to extreme elemental magic. Finn and Jake team up with Ice King (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]]), Betty (voiced by [[Felicia Day]]), and Lumpy Space Princess (voiced by Ward) to set things straight.\n\n''Elements'' is the third and final ''Adventure Time'' miniseries produced, following ''[[Stakes (miniseries)|Stakes]]'' (2015) and ''Islands'' (2017). The miniseries' story was developed by head writer [[Kent Osborne]], series showrunner Adam Muto, Jack Pendarvis, and Julia Pott; [[Patrick McHale (cartoonist)|Patrick McHale]] also contributed to the story for the episode \"Cloudy\". Storyboard artists who worked on this miniseries include Sam Alden, Polly Guo, Seo Kim, Somvilay Xayaphone, [[Steve Wolfhard]], [[Graham Falk]], Hanna K. Nystr\u00f6m, Aleks Sennwald, Kent Osborne, and Laura Knetzger. Cole Sanchez and Elizabeth Ito served as the miniseries' supervising directors, and Sandra Lee served as art director. All eight of the miniseries' installments were watched by approximately 0.90 million viewers, making them among the season's highest-watched episodes. ''Elements'' was released on DVD in Australia on July 3, 2018.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=April 2020}}\nFinn (voiced by [[Jeremy Shada]]), Jake (voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]), and BMO (voiced by [[Niki Yang]]) arrive back in Ooo and discover that their home has been converted to candy and that many of their friends are now happily brainwashed candy people. Finn, Jake, and BMO eventually locate Princess Bubblegum (voiced by [[Hynden Walch]]), who has become a large candy being with the power to forcibly convert matter into candy. While BMO is completely transformed by Bubblegum's power, Finn and Jake are rescued by Ice King (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]]), who then takes them to the Sky Kingdom. As Finn and Jake look down upon Ooo, they discover that it has been completely corrupted by the four primordial elements: candy, ice, slime, and fire.\n\nIce King explains that after Finn, Jake, and BMO left on their adventure Betty (voiced by [[Felicia Day]]) attempted to get Ice King to remember who he really is but in the process was kidnapped by Patience St. Pim (voiced by [[Lauren Lapkus]]), the ice elemental. Patience used Betty's magic to ensnare Princess Bubblegum, Flame Princess (voiced by [[Jessica DiCicco]]), and Slime Princess (voiced by [[Maria Bamford]]), who make up the remaining elementals. Unfortunately, Patience's plan went awry, and the elemental magic she unleashed took over Ooo. Finn, Jake and Ice King travel to the Ice World and confront Patience, who is disappointed that her plan did not go as planned. The group flee from the Ice Kingdom and rescue Betty, who argues that she can reset the world with an alternate-universe version of the ''Enchiridion''. In order to activate the book's power, however, the group must track down the jewels of power, which are found in the elementals' crowns.\n\nFinn and Jake journey to the transformed Slime Kingdom to retrieve Slime Princess' crown for her jewel. They run into Lumpy Space Princess (voiced by Ward), who is attending Slime Princess's roller skating party. The winners of the skating competition get absorbed into Slime Princess's whole being while the losers are caged up. Finn, Jake and Lumpy Space Princess enter, but lose, only to learn that by losing they still get absorbed. While Finn manages to grab the crown, Jake gets fully absorbed into Slime Princess, forcing Lumpy Space Princess to save Finn. Finn and Lumpy Space Princess flee and, along with Gunter the penguin, they journey to a radically altered Fire Kingdom to locate Flame Princess and her crown. The group finds the monarch\u2014who has turned into a mighty dragon\u2014in the bowels of the kingdom. When Flame Princess swallows the jewel necessary to save Ooo, Finn gives into his violence and begins attacking her, which transforms him into a fire person. Lumpy Space Princess, angered by the violence, yells at everyone to stop their fighting. The kingdom misinterprets her anger and decide to start a war with the Candy Kingdom.\n\nLumpy Space Princess chases after Finn and attempts to turn him back to normal, but to no avail; the Fire Kingdom citizens then start to fight the inhabitants of the Candy Kingdom. In a last ditch effort to save the world, Lumpy Space Princess reaches out to Finn's \"hero heart,\" which reminds him of happiness, returning him to normal. Finn collects the jewels necessary to revert the world and gives them to Betty, but she betrays him and leaves him behind. Betty reveals that she wants to use the jewels to go back in time and stop Simon from transforming into Ice King. Ice King, oblivious to her plans, accidentally ruins her spell, causing her to get transported to Mars. Meanwhile, Lumpy Space Princess rescues Finn from the candy inhabitants as Princess Bubblegum begins to convert the rest of Ooo into candy. Finn realizes that throughout this ordeal, Lumpy Space Princess has yet to be converted by elemental magic. He speculates that her immunity means that she is, in effect, the anti-elemental. After Ice King arrives with the gems, Lumpy Space Princess taps into her anti-elemental powers and transforms Ooo back to normal.\n\n==Production==\nIn late 2015, [[Cartoon Network]] aired an ''[[Adventure Time]]'' miniseries entitled ''[[Stakes (miniseries)|Stakes]]'' during the show's [[Adventure Time (season 7)|seventh season]].<ref name=\"Staff writers 2015\">{{Cite web | url=http://deadline.com/2015/02/cartoon-network-upfront-powerpuff-girls-adventure-time-1201376480/ | title=Cartoon Network Unveils Upfront Slate For 2015\u20132016 | work=Deadline Hollywood | publisher=Penske Media Corporation | date=February 19, 2015 | accessdate=February 20, 2015 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219173319/http://deadline.com/2015/02/cartoon-network-upfront-powerpuff-girls-adventure-time-1201376480/ | archivedate=February 19, 2015 | url-status=live }}</ref> This was followed in early 2017 by a second miniseries entitled ''[[Islands (miniseries)|Islands]]'', which aired as a part of the show's [[Adventure Time (season 8)|eighth season]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://theslanted.com/2016/12/25480/adventure-time-islands-mini-series-event/|title=''Adventure Time Islands'' Is a New Mini-Series Event Debuting this January|date=December 12, 2016|accessdate=December 12, 2016|publisher=TheSlanted|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170105083004/https://theslanted.com/2016/12/25480/adventure-time-islands-mini-series-event/|archivedate=January 5, 2017}}</ref> On March 30, 2017, Cartoon Network announced that these two miniseries would be succeeded by a third, entitled ''Elements''.<ref name=\"thirdminiseries\">{{cite web|last1=''Newsarama'' Staff|title=Ben 10 Reboot & 5 New Shows Lead Cartoon Network's 2017-18 Line-Up|url=http://www.newsarama.com/33804-ben-10-reboot-5-new-shows-lead-cartoon-network-s-2017-18-line-up.html|website=[[Newsarama]]|accessdate=March 31, 2017|date=March 30, 2017}}</ref><ref name=petskislate>{{cite web|last1=Petski|first1=Denise|title=Cartoon Network Unveils 2017-2018 Slate;

''Adventure Time'' follows the adventures of [[Finn the Human|Finn]] (voiced by [[Jeremy Shada]]), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother [[Jake the Dog|Jake]] (voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]), a dog with magical powers to change shape, and grow and shrink at will. In this limited event series, which itself follows the events of the ''[[Islands (miniseries)|Islands]]'' miniseries, Finn, Jake, and [[List of Adventure Time characters#BMO|BMO]] return home to discover that Ooo (i.e. the magical land in which they live) has been turned into a veritable dystopia thanks to extreme elemental magic. Finn and Jake team up with Ice King (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]]), Betty (voiced by [[Felicia Day]]), and Lumpy Space Princess (voiced by Ward) to set things straight.\n\n''Elements'' is the third and final ''Adventure Time'' miniseries produced, following ''[[Stakes (miniseries)|Stakes]]'' (2015) and ''Islands'' (2017). The miniseries' story was developed by head writer [[Kent Osborne]], series showrunner Adam Muto, Jack Pendarvis, and Julia Pott; [[Patrick McHale (cartoonist)|Patrick McHale]] also contributed to the story for the episode \"Cloudy\". Storyboard artists who worked on this miniseries include Sam Alden, Polly Guo, Seo Kim, Somvilay Xayaphone, [[Steve Wolfhard]], [[Graham Falk]], Hanna K. Nystr\u00f6m, Aleks Sennwald, Kent Osborne, and Laura Knetzger. Cole Sanchez and Elizabeth Ito served as the miniseries' supervising directors, and Sandra Lee served as art director. All eight of the miniseries' installments were watched by approximately 0.90 million viewers, making them among the season's highest-watched episodes. ''Elements'' was released on DVD in Australia on July 3, 2018.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=April 2020}}\nFinn (voiced by [[Jeremy Shada]]), Jake (voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]), and BMO (voiced by [[Niki Yang]]) arrive back in Ooo and discover that their home has been converted to candy and that many of their friends are now happily brainwashed candy people. Finn, Jake, and BMO eventually locate Princess Bubblegum (voiced by [[Hynden Walch]]), who has become a large candy being with the power to forcibly convert matter into candy. While BMO is completely transformed by Bubblegum's power, Finn and Jake are rescued by Ice King (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]]), who then takes them to the Sky Kingdom. As Finn and Jake look down, they discover that Ooo has been divided into four completely corrupted sections which correspond to the four primordial elements: candy, ice, slime, and fire.\n\nIce King explains that after Finn, Jake, and BMO left on their adventure Betty (voiced by [[Felicia Day]]) attempted to get Ice King to remember who he really is but in the process was kidnapped by Patience St. Pim (voiced by [[Lauren Lapkus]]), the ice elemental. St. Pim used Betty's magic to ensnare Princess Bubblegum, Flame Princess (voiced by [[Jessica DiCicco]]), and Slime Princess (voiced by [[Maria Bamford]]), who make up the remaining elementals. Unfortunately, St. Pim's plan went awry, and the elemental magic she unleashed took over Ooo. Finn, Jake and Ice King travel to the Ice World and confront a powered-up but rather withheld Patience, who is disappointed that her plan did not go as planned. The group flee from the Ice Kingdom and rescue Betty, who reveals that she can help them reset the world with an alternate-universe version of the ''Enchiridion''. In order to activate its power, however, the group will need to track down the jewels of power which are found in the elementals' crowns.\n\nFinn and Jake eventually journey to the transformed Slime Kingdom to retrieve Slime Princess' crown for her jewel. They run into Lumpy Space Princess (voiced by Ward), who is attending Slime Princess's roller skating party. The winners of the skating competition get absorbed into Slime Princess's whole being while the losers are caged up. Finn, Jake and Lumpy Space Princess enter, but lose, only to learn that by losing they still get absorbed. While Finn manages to grab the crown, Jake gets fully absorbed into Slime Princess, forcing Lumpy Space Princess to save Finn. Finn and Lumpy Space Princess flee and, along with Gunter the penguin, they journey to a radically altered Fire Kingdom to locate Flame Princess and her crown. The group finds the monarch in the bowels of the kingdom, and realize that she has been transformed into a dragon. When she swallows the jewel necessary to save Ooo, Finn gives into his violence and begins attacking her, which transforms him into a fire person. Lumpy Space Princess, angered by the violence, yells at everyone to stop their fighting. The kingdom misinterprets her anger and decide to start a war with the Candy Kingdom.\n\nLumpy Space Princess chases Finn and attempts to turn him back to normal, but to no avail. Ice King and Betty try to intervene, but are swatted away by Flame Princess. The Fire Kingdom then start to fight the inhabitants of the Candy Kingdom, making the whole situation worse. In a last ditch effort to save the world, Lumpy Space Princess reaches out to Finn's \"hero heart,\" which reminds him of happiness, returning him to normal. Finn collects the jewels necessary to revert the world and gives them to Betty, but she betrays him and leaves him behind. Betty also knocks out Ice King and reveals that she wants to use the jewels to go back in time and stop Simon from transforming into Ice King. Ice King, still oblivious to her plans, accidentally ruins her spell, causing her to get transported to Mars. Meanwhile, Lumpy Space Princess rescues Finn from the candy inhabitants as Princess Bubblegum enacts her plan to convert the rest of Ooo into candy. Finn realizes that throughout this ordeal, Lumpy Space Princess has yet to be converted by elemental magic. He speculates that her immunity means that she is, in effect, the anti-elemental. Ice King arrives with the gems, and using their power along with her anti-elemental energy, Lumpy Space Princess transforms all of Ooo back to normal.\n\n==Production==\nIn late 2015, [[Cartoon Network]] aired an ''[[Adventure Time]]'' miniseries entitled ''[[Stakes (miniseries)|Stakes]]'' during the show's [[Adventure Time (season 7)|seventh season]].<ref name=\"Staff writers 2015\">{{Cite web | url=http://deadline.com/2015/02/cartoon-network-upfront-powerpuff-girls-adventure-time-1201376480/ | title=Cartoon Network Unveils Upfront Slate For 2015\u20132016 | work=Deadline Hollywood | publisher=Penske Media Corporation | date=February 19, 2015 | accessdate=February 20, 2015 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219173319/http://deadline.com/2015/02/cartoon-network-upfront-powerpuff-girls-adventure-time-1201376480/ | archivedate=February 19, 2015 | url-status=live }}</ref> This was followed in early 2017 by a second miniseries entitled ''[[Islands (miniseries)|Islands]]'', which aired as a part of the show's [[Adventure Time (season 8)|eighth season]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://theslanted.com/2016/12/25480/adventure-time-islands-mini-series-event/|title=''Adventure Time Islands'' Is a New Mini-Series Event Debuting this January|date=December 12, 2016|accessdate=December 12, 2016|publisher=TheSlanted|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170105083004/https://theslanted.com/2016/12/25480/adventure-time-islands-mini-series-event/|archivedate=January 5, 2017}}</ref> On March 30, 2017, Cartoon Network announced that these two miniseries would be succeeded by a third, entitled ''Elements''.<ref name=\"thirdminiseries\">{{cite web|last1=''Newsarama'' Staff|title=Ben 10 Reboot & 5 New Shows Lead Cartoon Network's 2017-18 Line-Up|url=http://www.newsarama.com/33804-ben-10-reboot-5-new-shows-lead-cartoon-network-s-2017-18-line-up.html|website=[[Newsarama]]|accessdate=March 31, 2017|date=March 30, 2017}}</ref><ref name=petskislate>{{cite web|last1=Petski|first1=Denise|title=Cartoon Network Unveils 2017-2018 Slate;

This definition is confirmed by the acclaimed Jurist [[Hugo Grotius]], the father of [[international law]] and the concept of sovereignty. \"holders of allodial land are sovereign\" because allodial land is by nature free, hereditary, inherited from thier forefathers, sovereign and held by the grace of God. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Adam|first=Frank|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=_U0Ii-Om3EwC&pg=PA97&lpg=PA97&dq=allod+land+held+by+the+grace+of+god&source=bl&ots=O6M8DRfasa&sig=ACfU3U2q7vi8wYwh_bbBIq0o9FJEubVW9w&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiS9uiK-8noAhVIB50JHZjkBxoQ6AEwAHoECAUQAQ#v=onepage&q=allod%20land%20held%20by%20the%20grace%20of%20god&f=false|title=The Clans, Septs & Regiments of the Scottish Highlands|date=1970|publisher=Genealogical Publishing Com|isbn=978-0-8063-0448-9|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThis form of ownership meant that the landowner owed no feudal duties to any other person. An allod could be inherited freely according to the usual law of the land. To begin with, the income from allodial estates was not even liable for [[tax]]es paid to any other sovereigns including the [[territorial prince]]s (''Landesf\u00fcrsten''). \n\nIn all of these ways, the allod differed from [[fief]]s, which were mere tenures held by [[feudatories]] (''[[Lehnsm\u00e4nner]]'') or their [[vassal]]s (''Vasallen''). Overall suzerainty in a [[fief]] remained with the [[feudal lord]], who could require of his vassals certain services which varied from vassal to vassal. Also, the ownership of a fief was split so that a lord had ''[[dominium directum]]'' and his tenant in fee had ''[[dominium utile]]'' (German ''nutzbares Eigentum''). By contrast, an allodiary had a full freehold interest \u2014 or ''dominium plenum'' (''volles Eigentum'') \u2014 in his allod. This was also reflected in the contemporaneous synonym for an allod, ''Erbe und Eigen'' (loosely \"inheritance and ownership\"). Borough properties were usually allodial in nature. Likewise, ecclesiastical institutions (e.g. abbeys and cathedrals) owned allodial estates.\n\nThe conversion of a fief into a freehold \u2014 a familiar process in the 19th century \u2014 is called [[enfranchisement]]. Ownership of enfranchised fiefs continued to be limited, however, to the rights of the former feudatories. Only the overall suzerainty of the feudal lord over the estate was repealed, while the rights of the feudatory remained unaffected. Such an enfranchised fief became analogous to entailment (''Familienfideikommiss''); often it was explicitly converted into a [[fee tail]] (''Fideikommissgut'').\n\n== Emergence and historical development ==\nThe allod as a form of ownership was established among the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes and peoples]], before it became part of the feudal system. Land that was originally held in common by the whole community was transferred to a single individual. The freemen of the Germanic peoples divided or drew lots for the land in the countries they had conquered and taken possession of. This gave rise to the essential character of the allodial estate: a freely-owned property allocated and guaranteed by the will of the whole people or by the people's law (''Volksgesetz''). The landowner was independent of any superiors and free of any property right restrictions.\n\nIn many regions only allodiaries were counted as freemen, i.e., those who enjoyed all common, public rights and duties. They served as territorial assemblymen (''Landesgemeinde''). The allodiaries of the [[early Middle Ages]] are one of the groups out of which the [[nobility]] sprang over time. They saw themselves as equal partners of the [[territorial lord]]s, because they participated alongside them as members of the territorial assembly and were not their vassals. The freedoms associated with allodial estates (tax exemption, hunting rights, etc.) were only exercised by the nobility in most states - even if, after 1500, they had to subordinate themselves increasingly to the [[territorial prince]]s (as part of the establishment of statehood) - who remained, politically and economically, the most influential group of landowners. The term \u2018allod\u2019 occurs only in the Franconian region and those territories influenced [[Frankish law|legally]] by Frankish tribes. After the [[Battle of Hastings]] in 1066, there were no more allods in England at all (though [[Lundy]] was later deemed to not be ''in England'') and, in France, allodial estates existed mainly in the south. In Germany, the allodial estates were mainly those owned by the nobility in the south. There were many lords who founded their powerful position on extensive allodial estates in the eastern Alpine countries and the [[lands of the Bohemian Crown]]. The king as lord paramount never exercised lordship over the whole Empire.\n\nAn allodial estate could also be created when a lord renounced his rights in favour of his vassal. Deforested land was considered allodial by the princes. Conversely, free territorial lords were sometimes punished by the Emperor by converting their allodial land into fiefs.\n\nThe differences between the two forms of medieval ownership - the fief and the allod - diminished over time. Firstly, vassals were no longer required to render services from the 17th century at the latest, and vassals\u2019 rights of [[inheritance]] became much stronger in the early modern period, and, secondly, the [[territorial prince]]s were able to force freemen in the 16th century to make regular tax payments. In the 19th century, [[feudal law]] was finally gradually abolished in most [[Europe]]an countries largely due to the Napoleonic wars and the influence of the [[Napoleonic Code]]. It fully integrated the ''[[ius commune]]'' system of ownership as a full right ''in rem''.  While in France the ''r\u00e9gime f\u00e9odal'' was ended in 1789 by the stroke of the pen under the Revolutionary legislature, in Germany it was not until the mid-20th century that feudal law was formally abolished in 1947 by [[Allied Control Council]] law. In most of Scotland, the feudal system was abolished in the early 21st century; [[Udal law|allodial tenure still exists in Shetland and Orkney]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Commons]]\n* [[Feudalism in the Holy Roman Empire]]\n* [[Crown land]]\n* [[Imperial estate]]\n* [[Droit de r\u00e9gale]]\n* [[Allodial title]]\n\n== Literature ==\n* [[Otto Brunner]]: ''Land und Herrschaft.

Georgia|Houston]] and [[Peach County, Georgia|Peach]] counties in the central part of the state. It is currently Georgia's [[Georgia (U.S. state)#Major cities|tenth-largest]] incorporated city, with an estimated population of 75,797 in 2018.\n\nThe city is the main component of the [[Warner Robins, GA Metropolitan Statistical Area|Warner Robins Metropolitan Statistical Area]], including the entirety of Houston, Peach, and [[Pulaski County, Georgia|Pulaski]] counties, which had an estimated population of 193,835 in 2018; it, in turn, is a component of a larger trade area, the [[Macon-Warner Robins-Fort Valley, GA CSA|Macon-Warner Robins-Fort Valley Combined Statistical Area]], with an estimated 2018 population of 423,572. [[Robins Air Force Base]], a major U.S. Air Force maintenance and logistics complex founded as Warner Robins Air Depot in 1942, is located just east of the city limits; the base's expansion and the [[suburbanization]] of nearby [[Macon, Georgia|Macon]] have led to the city's rapid growth in the post-World War II era.\n\n==History==\nWarner Robins was founded in 1942 when the small farming community of Wellston was renamed for General [[Augustine Warner Robins]] (1882-1940) of the United States Army Air Corps, which later became the United States Air Force.<ref>{{cite book | url=http://www.kenkrakow.com/gpn/w.pdf| title=Georgia Place-Names: Their History and Origins | publisher=Winship Press | author=Krakow, Kenneth K. | year=1975 | location=Macon, GA | pages=246 | isbn=0-915430-00-2}}</ref> It was incorporated as a town in 1943 and as a city in 1956.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=REtEXQNWq6MC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA251#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Historical Gazetteer of the United States | publisher=Routledge | date=May 13, 2013 | accessdate=30 November 2013 | author=Hellmann, Paul T. | pages=251}}</ref>\n\nThe 1940 census shows that the community of Wellston was sparsely populated and inhabited primarily by farmers and their families. Its most notable landmark was a stop on the railroad line. Wellston also had a small sawmill and a grocery store. Peach orchards covered parts of the surrounding land.\n\n[[World War II]] soon changed this. The War Department made plans to build an air depot in the Southeast. With the assistance of influential U.S. Representative [[Carl Vinson]], Wellston community leader Charles Bostic \"Boss\" Watson worked with officials in Macon to make a bid to locate this air depot in Houston County. In June 1941, the U.S. government accepted this offer, which included {{Convert|3108|acre|km2}} of land.<ref>{{cite book|title=The New Georgia Guide|date=1996|publisher=The University of Georgia Press|location=Athens, GA|isbn=0-8203-1799-3|page=[https://archive.org/details/newgeorgiaguide0000unse/page/433 433]|url=https://archive.org/details/newgeorgiaguide0000unse/page/433}}</ref>\n\nThis air force base was initially called Wellston Army Air Depot when it opened in 1942. The first commander was Colonel Charles E. Thomas. He wanted to name this depot in honor of his mentor Augustine Warner Robins, who was called by his middle name, Warner. Regulations prevented him from doing this, which required the base to be named after the nearest town. Not deterred by this, Colonel Thomas persuaded Boss Watson and the other community leaders to rename the town of Wellston. So on September 1, 1942, the town was given the new name of Warner Robins.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dixon|first1=Claire|title=Warner Robins: The Second 25 Years|date=1993|publisher=WH Wolfe Associates|location=Alpharetta, GA|pages=1\u20132}}</ref> Soon thereafter, on October 14, 1942, the base was renamed to become Warner Robins Army Air Depot. The city has a unique name, shared with no other town in the United States.\n\n[[Robins Air Force Base]] is not within the city limits of the town but is across [[U.S. Route 129 in Georgia|U.S. Highway 129]] ([[Georgia State Highway 247]]), which serves as a boundary between the base and the city.\n\nIn 2018, [[First Solar]] announced a project for a 200-megawatt, {{Convert|2000|acre|km2|sp=us|adj=on}} solar panel facility in [[Twiggs County]] east of Warner Robins.

Georgia|Houston]] and [[Peach County, Georgia|Peach]] counties in the central part of the state. It is currently Georgia's [[Georgia (U.S. state)#Major cities|tenth-largest]] incorporated city, with an estimated population of 75,797 in 2018.\n\nThe city is the main component of the [[Warner Robins, GA Metropolitan Statistical Area|Warner Robins Metropolitan Statistical Area]], including the entirety of Houston, Peach, and [[Pulaski County, Georgia|Pulaski]] counties, which had an estimated population of 193,835 in 2018; it, in turn, is a component of a larger trade area, the [[Macon-Warner Robins-Fort Valley, GA CSA|Macon-Warner Robins-Fort Valley Combined Statistical Area]], with an estimated 2018 population of 423,572. [[Robins Air Force Base]], a major U.S. Air Force maintenance and logistics complex founded as Warner Robins Air Depot in 1942, is located just east of the city limits; the base's expansion and the [[suburbanization]] of nearby [[Macon, Georgia|Macon]] have led to the city's rapid growth in the post-World War II era.\n\n==History==\nWarner Robins was founded in 1942 when the small farming community of Wellston was renamed for General [[Augustine Warner Robins]] (1882-1940) of the United States Army Air Corps, which later became the United States Air Force.<ref>{{cite book | url=http://www.kenkrakow.com/gpn/w.pdf| title=Georgia Place-Names: Their History and Origins | publisher=Winship Press | author=Krakow, Kenneth K. | year=1975 | location=Macon, GA | pages=246 | isbn=0-915430-00-2}}</ref> It was incorporated as a town in 1943 and as a city in 1956.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=REtEXQNWq6MC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA251#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Historical Gazetteer of the United States | publisher=Routledge | date=May 13, 2013 | accessdate=30 November 2013 | author=Hellmann, Paul T. | pages=251}}</ref>\n\nThe 1940 census shows that the community of Wellston was sparsely populated and inhabited primarily by farmers and their families. Its most notable landmark was a stop on the railroad line. Wellston also had a small sawmill and a grocery store. Peach orchards covered parts of the surrounding land.\n\n[[World War II]] soon changed this. The War Department made plans to build an air depot in the Southeast. With the assistance of influential U.S. Representative [[Carl Vinson]], Wellston community leader Charles Bostic \"Boss\" Watson worked with officials in Macon to make a bid to locate this air depot in Houston County. In June 1941, the U.S. government accepted this offer, which included {{Convert|3108|acre|km2}} of land.<ref>{{cite book|title=The New Georgia Guide|date=1996|publisher=The University of Georgia Press|location=Athens, GA|isbn=0-8203-1799-3|page=[https://archive.org/details/newgeorgiaguide0000unse/page/433 433]|url=https://archive.org/details/newgeorgiaguide0000unse/page/433}}</ref>\n\nThis air force base was initially called Wellston Army Air Depot when it opened in 1942. The first commander was Colonel Charles E. Thomas. He wanted to name this depot in honor of his mentor Augustine Warner Robins, who was called by his middle name, Warner. Regulations prevented him from doing this, which required the base to be named after the nearest town. Not deterred by this, Colonel Thomas persuaded Boss Watson and the other community leaders to rename the town of Wellston. So on September 1, 1942, the town was given the new name of Warner Robins.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dixon|first1=Claire|title=Warner Robins: The Second 25 Years|date=1993|publisher=WH Wolfe Associates|location=Alpharetta, GA|pages=1\u20132}}</ref> Soon thereafter, on October 14, 1942, the base was renamed to become Warner Robins Army Air Depot. The city has a unique name, shared with no other town in the United States.\n\n[[Robins Air Force Base]] is not within the city limits of the town but is across [[U.S. Route 129 in Georgia|U.S. Highway 129]] ([[Georgia State Highway 247]]), which serves as a boundary between the base and the city.\n\nIn 2018, [[First Solar]] announced a project for a 200-megawatt, {{Convert|2000|acre|km2|sp=us|adj=on}} solar panel facility in [[Twiggs County]] east of Warner Robins.
