It stars [[Sandra Bullock]], [[Melissa McCarthy]], [[Demi\u00e1n Bichir]], [[Marlon Wayans]], [[Michael Rapaport]], and [[Jane Curtin]]. The film centers on [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] [[Special Agent]] Sarah Ashburn and [[Boston Police Department|Boston]] Detective Shannon Mullins, who must take down a mobster in [[Boston]].\n\nThe film was released in the United States on June 28, 2013. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the chemistry, and performances of Bullock and McCarthy, but called the film predictable.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/Critics-Consensus-White-House-Down-Is-Predictable-Action-Fluff/|title=Critics Consensus: White House Down Is Predictable Action Fluff|first=Tim|last=Ryan|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|date=June 28, 2013|accessdate=August 27, 2017}}</ref> It was a success at the box office, grossing $229 million worldwide against a $43 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\n[[FBI agent]] Sarah Ashburn (Sandra Bullock) is an expert investigator in [[New York City]]. She is disliked by other agents for her uptight and arrogant personality. Her supervisor, who is considering her for promotion, assigns her to a mission in [[Boston]]. She meets [[Boston Police Department]] detective Shannon Mullins (Melissa McCarthy),  who is skilled but loudmouthed and hot-headed. The two women's professional styles clash horribly during their attempt to interrogate a local drug dealer. Ashburn reluctantly agrees to work with Mullins.\n\nAshburn and Mullins tail a local nightclub manager to his business, Club Ekko, and place a [[Covert listening device|bug]] on his phone to get information on a drug lord named Simon Larkin. Leaving the club, Ashburn and Mullins are confronted by [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] agents Craig and Adam, who've been working the Larkin case for months. The women discover a surveillance video in the DEA agents' van showing that Mullins' brother, Jason, recently released from prison where Mullins had sent him, appears to be connected to Larkin.\n\nAshburn convinces Mullins to go to her parents' home to ask Jason for information on Larkin. The whole family are angry with Mullins for arresting her brother. But Jason tips Mullins off about the body of a murdered drug dealer, and chemicals on the victim's shoes lead the women to an abandoned paint factory, where they witness a drug dealer being murdered by Julian Vincent, second-in-command of Larkin's organization. They apprehend Julian but get no information on Larkin's whereabouts, despite Mullins threatening to shoot Julian's genitals.\n\nThe women spend the evening bonding in a bar. A drunk Ashburn reveals that her [[foster child]] past is to blame for her bad attitude. The next morning Ashburn discovers that she has given her car away to one of the bar patrons, but when he starts the car, it explodes.\n\nJulian has escaped from custody and intends to harm Mullins' family, so Mullins moves them into a motel. Jason tries to join the Larkin organization in an attempt to help Mullins solve the case. He gives her a tip about a drug shipment coming in, and despite Mullins' reluctance, Ashburn calls in the FBI, who discover that it is only a pleasure cruise ship. Larkin shoots Jason for informing the FBI about the supposed drug shipment. Jason is rendered comatose. Mullins and Ashburn fall out, with Mullins vowing to bring her brother's attacker to justice. They reconcile after arresting several drug dealers as they try to ascertain Larkin's whereabouts.\n\nThe women equip themselves with assault weapons from Mullins' extensive personal arsenal, and infiltrate one of Larkin's warehouses, but they are captured and bound. Julian is about to torture them with knives when he gets called away by Larkin. Before Julian leaves, he stabs Ashburn in the leg and leaves the knife in the wound. Mullins removes the knife from Ashburn's leg and uses it to cut the rope binding her hands. However, they are discovered by Craig and Adam. Craig begins to untie the two women, but is shot and killed by Adam. Ashburn and Mullins learn that Adam is actually Larkin, who has been working his own case from inside the DEA for several months.\n\nJulian returns and Larkin orders him to kill Ashburn and Mullins while he goes to the hospital to kill Jason. After Larkin leaves, Mullins frees herself and Ashburn incapacitates Julian. The duo race to the hospital to save Jason.\n\nUpon their arrival, Mullins searches for Jason; Ashburn, hindered by the stab wound in her leg, lags behind. Mullins finds Jason's room, but is disarmed by Larkin, who is about to kill Jason. Ashburn appears and subdues Larkin by shooting him in the genitals. Ashburn requests to stay in the FBI's Boston field office, having developed a strong friendship with Mullins.\n\nJason is shown having fully recovered from his coma. Mullins receives a commendation from the Boston Police Department. Members of her family are present, and they all cheer for her.\n\nThe film ends with Mullins having signed the back of Ashburn's yearbook, \"Foster kid, now you have a sister\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Sandra Bullock]] as Sarah Ashburn\n* [[Melissa McCarthy]] as Shannon Mullins\n* [[Demi\u00e1n Bichir]] as Hale\n* [[Marlon Wayans]] as Levy\n* [[Michael Rapaport]] as Jason Mullins\n* [[Dan Bakkedahl]] as Special Agent Garrett Craig\n* [[Taran Killam]] as Special Agent Adam / Simon Larkin\n* [[Michael McDonald (comedian)|Michael McDonald]] as Julian Vincent\n* [[Spoken Reasons]] as Terrell Rojas\n* [[Jane Curtin]] as Mrs. Mullins\n* [[Michael Tucci|Michael B.

It stars [[Sandra Bullock]], [[Melissa McCarthy]], [[Demi\u00e1n Bichir]], [[Marlon Wayans]], [[Michael Rapaport]], and [[Jane Curtin]]. The film centers on [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] [[Special Agent]] Sarah Ashburn and [[Boston Police Department|Boston]] Detective Shannon Mullins, who must take down a mobster in [[Boston]].\n\nThe film was released in the United States on June 28, 2013. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the chemistry, and performances of Bullock and McCarthy, but called the film predictable.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/Critics-Consensus-White-House-Down-Is-Predictable-Action-Fluff/|title=Critics Consensus: White House Down Is Predictable Action Fluff|first=Tim|last=Ryan|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|date=June 28, 2013|accessdate=August 27, 2017}}</ref> It was a success at the box office, grossing $229 million worldwide against a $43 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\n[[FBI agent]] Sarah Ashburn is an expert investigator in [[New York City]]. She is disliked by other agents for her uptight and arrogant personality. Her supervisor, who is considering her for promotion, assigns her to a mission in [[Boston]]. She meets [[Boston Police Department]] detective Shannon Mullins,  who is skilled but loudmouthed and hot-headed. The two women's professional styles clash horribly during their attempt to interrogate a local drug dealer. Ashburn reluctantly agrees to work with Mullins.\n\nAshburn and Mullins tail a local nightclub manager to his business, Club Ekko, and place a [[Covert listening device|bug]] on his phone to get information on a drug lord named Simon Larkin. Leaving the club, Ashburn and Mullins are confronted by [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] agents Craig and Adam, who've been working the Larkin case for months. The women discover a surveillance video in the DEA agents' van showing that Mullins' brother, Jason, recently released from prison where Mullins had sent him, appears to be connected to Larkin.\n\nAshburn convinces Mullins to go to her parents' home to ask Jason for information on Larkin. The whole family are angry with Mullins for arresting her brother. But Jason tips Mullins off about the body of a murdered drug dealer, and chemicals on the victim's shoes lead the women to an abandoned paint factory, where they witness a drug dealer being murdered by Julian Vincent, second-in-command of Larkin's organization. They apprehend Julian but get no information on Larkin's whereabouts, despite Mullins threatening to shoot Julian's genitals.\n\nThe women spend the evening bonding in a bar. A drunk Ashburn reveals that her [[foster child]] past is to blame for her bad attitude. The next morning Ashburn discovers that she has given her car away to one of the bar patrons, but when he starts the car, it explodes.\n\nJulian has escaped from custody and intends to harm Mullins' family, so Mullins moves them into a motel. Jason tries to join the Larkin organization in an attempt to help Mullins solve the case. He gives her a tip about a drug shipment coming in, and despite Mullins' reluctance, Ashburn calls in the FBI, who discover that it is only a pleasure cruise ship. Larkin shoots Jason for informing the FBI about the supposed drug shipment. Jason is rendered comatose. Mullins and Ashburn fall out, with Mullins vowing to bring her brother's attacker to justice. They reconcile after arresting several drug dealers as they try to ascertain Larkin's whereabouts.\n\nThe women equip themselves with assault weapons from Mullins' extensive personal arsenal, and infiltrate one of Larkin's warehouses, but they are captured and bound. Julian is about to torture them with knives when he gets called away by Larkin. Before Julian leaves, he stabs Ashburn in the leg and leaves the knife in the wound. Mullins removes the knife from Ashburn's leg and uses it to cut the rope binding her hands. However, they are discovered by Craig and Adam. Craig begins to untie the two women, but is shot and killed by Adam. Ashburn and Mullins learn that Adam is actually Larkin, who has been working his own case from inside the DEA for several months.\n\nJulian returns and Larkin orders him to kill Ashburn and Mullins while he goes to the hospital to kill Jason. After Larkin leaves, Mullins frees herself and Ashburn incapacitates Julian. The duo race to the hospital to save Jason.\n\nUpon their arrival, Mullins searches for Jason; Ashburn, hindered by the stab wound in her leg, lags behind. Mullins finds Jason's room, but is disarmed by Larkin, who is about to kill Jason. Ashburn appears and subdues Larkin by shooting him in the genitals. Ashburn requests to stay in the FBI's Boston field office, having developed a strong friendship with Mullins.\n\nJason is shown having fully recovered from his coma. Mullins receives a commendation from the Boston Police Department. Members of her family are present, and they all cheer for her.\n\nThe film ends with Mullins having signed the back of Ashburn's yearbook, \"Foster kid, now you have a sister\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Sandra Bullock]] as Sarah Ashburn\n* [[Melissa McCarthy]] as Shannon Mullins\n* [[Demi\u00e1n Bichir]] as Hale\n* [[Marlon Wayans]] as Levy\n* [[Michael Rapaport]] as Jason Mullins\n* [[Dan Bakkedahl]] as Special Agent Garrett Craig\n* [[Taran Killam]] as Special Agent Adam / Simon Larkin\n* [[Michael McDonald (comedian)|Michael McDonald]] as Julian Vincent\n* [[Spoken Reasons]] as Terrell Rojas\n* [[Jane Curtin]] as Mrs. Mullins\n* [[Michael Tucci|Michael B.

The twelfth installment in the ''[[Bomberman]]'' series, it was first released in Japan on 19 July 1996, in North America on 22 August 1997 and in Europe in 1997. It is best known for its multiplayer functionality for up to ten players.\n\nThe game received mixed reviews upon release, with critics commenting that the game is enjoyable but fails to truly advance the ''Bomberman'' series beyond previous installments.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:Saturnbomberman.png|thumb|Saturn Bomberman start screen]]\nLike most ''Bomberman'' games, ''Saturn Bomberman'' features a battle mode as well as a story mode. Along with them is a master mode in which the player races to finish a series of [[level (computer and video games)|levels]] after which the player is given a rank based on how much time is taken. This time is then saved to memory and kept on a scoreboard for future reference.<ref name=SSM19>{{cite magazine |first=Matt|last=Yeo|title=Things that Make You Go Boom!|magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]|issue=19|publisher=[[Emap International Limited]] |date=May 1997|pages=40-43}}</ref> The game also features several new powerups.\n\n''Saturn Bomberman'' utilises Dinosaur helpers, which are initially found as eggs released upon the destruction of a soft block. Dinosaurs come in three levels: babies (the weakest), adolescents, and adults (the strongest). Dinosaurs can only take one hit no matter how large they are. If a player is riding a dinosaur when this happens, the dinosaur takes the hit instead of the player.<ref name=SSM19/> As powerups are collected, a special meter at the top of the screen slowly builds up. Once this meter is full, the dinosaur will grow one level, from baby to adolescent or adolescent to adult. However, in battle mode this system works differently. Whenever a player collects an egg while riding on a dinosaur, the dinosaur will grow. The player can jump off of the dinosaur at any time.\n\n===Story mode===\n''Saturn Bomberman'' has a story mode which can be played single player or two-player.<ref name=SSM19/>\n\nThe story mode levels involve blowing up poles with glowing red orbs on the top (which are known as Zarfs) while avoiding (or destroying) enemies, blowing up blocks and collecting powerups. Once all the Zarfs on a level have been destroyed, an exit appears. Upon entering the exit, Bomberman will do a victory pose, then a short [[cut scene]] takes place. The cut scene shows a piece of scenery moving out of the way, then Bomberman walks through, and something closes up the way he came from. After the cut scene, the next level begins.\n\n===Battle mode===\n''Saturn Bomberman'' supports up to ten human players on battle mode with 2 [[multitap]]s,<ref name=EGM92>{{cite magazine|title=Protos: Bomberman |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=92|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=March 1997 |page=34}}</ref> 7 players with just one multitap, or two players without any multitaps. It is also possible to combat against CPU-controlled opponents in battle mode.<ref name=EGM92/>\n\nIf the number of players in a game exceeds eight, the game is played on a widescreen arena, shrinking the characters and blocks to tiny proportions, making the playing field very large. This also disables many of the powerups including dinosaurs.\n\nThe North American version also supports the [[Sega NetLink]] for up to four player online via two players per console.<ref>http://segaretro.org/Saturn_Bomberman</ref><ref>http://segaretro.org/index.php?title=File%3ASaturnbomberman_sat_us_manual.pdf&page=22</ref>\n==Plot==\n{{Sect-stub|date=April 2020}}\n==Reception==\n{{VG Reviews\n| Allgame = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=1938&tab=review|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210172659/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=1938&tab=review|title=Saturn Bomberman|author=Rovi Corporation|archivedate=10 December 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n| CVG = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File:CVG_UK_186.pdf&page=72|title=File:CVG UK 186.pdf - Retro CDN|publisher=}}</ref>\n| EGM = 9.25 / 10<ref name=EGM100>{{cite magazine |title=Review Crew: Saturn Bomberman |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=100 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=November 1997|page=191}}</ref>\n| GameFan = 277 / 300<ref>''GameFan'', volume 4, issue 10, page 19</ref>\n| GameRev = A-<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/saturn-bomberman|title=Saturn Bomberman Review|publisher=}}</ref>\n| GMaster = 90%<ref>''[[GamesMaster (magazine)|GamesMaster]]'', issue 56, page 61</ref>\n| GSpot = 7.8/10<ref name=GSrev>{{cite web |last=Gerstmann |first=Jeff |authorlink=Jeff Gerstmann |title=Saturn Bomberman Review |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/saturn-bomberman-review/1900-2533822/ |website=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=14 November 2018 |date=October 10, 1997}}</ref>\n| rev1 = ''[[:de:CyPress|Fun Generation]]''\n| rev1Score = 9 / 10<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ninretro.de/game-8-176.html|title=Saturn Bomberman (Saturn) - N.i.n.Retro (New is not Retro) v3+|publisher=}}</ref>\n| NGen = {{rating|3|5}}<ref name=NGen35>{{cite magazine |title=Finals: Saturn Bomberman |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=35|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=November 1997|page=199}}</ref>\n| rev3 = ''[[:fr:Player One|Player One]]''\n| rev3Score = 95%<ref>''Player One'', issue 75, pages 86-89</ref>\n| rev4 = ''[[:fr:Cyber Press Publishing|Play Mag]]''\n| rev4Score = 90%<ref>http://download.abandonware.org/magazines/PlayMag/playmag_numero006/playmag%20N6%20septembre%201996%20053.JPG</ref>\n| rev5 = ''[[Saturn Power]]''\n| rev5Score = 91/100<ref name=SatP1>{{cite magazine|first=Dean|last=Mortlock|title=Review: Bomberman SS|magazine=[[Saturn Power]]|issue=1|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=June 1997|page=75}}</ref>\n| rev6 = ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]''\n| rev6Score = 90%<ref name=SSMrev>{{cite magazine |first=Matt|last=Yeo|title=Review: Saturn Bomberman|magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]|issue=19|publisher=[[Emap International Limited]] |date=May 1997|pages=52-53|url=http://segaretro.org/index.php?title=File:SSM_UK_19.pdf&page=52}}</ref>\n}}\n\nCritics were split over ''Saturn Bomberman''.

This brings the Line Islands into the same day as the Kiribati Islands. Kiribati's easternmost islands, the southern Line Islands, south of [[Hawaii]], have the most advanced time on Earth: [[UTC+14:00|UTC+14]] hours. Kiribati is the only country in the world to be situated in all four hemispheres.\n\nKiribati gained its independence from the [[United Kingdom]], becoming  a [[sovereign state]] in 1979. The capital, [[South Tarawa]], now the most populated area, consists of a number of islets, connected by a series of [[causeway]]s. These comprise about half the area of [[Tarawa]] Atoll.\n\nKiribati is a member of the [[Pacific Community]] (SPC), [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], and the [[World Bank]], and became a full member of the [[United Nations]] in 1999.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Kiribati'' was adopted in 1979 at independence. It is the [[Gilbertese]] rendition of ''Gilberts''. This name derives from the English pronunciation of the name of the main archipelago that forms the nation. It was named in 1820 by [[Adam Johann von Krusenstern]] as \u00ab \u00eeles Gilbert \u00bb, in English the [[Gilbert Islands]], after the British [[Sea captain|captain]] [[Thomas Gilbert (sea captain)|Thomas Gilbert]]. He and captain [[John Marshall (Royal Navy officer)|John Marshall]] sighted some of the islands in 1788, while crossing the Outer Passage route from [[Port Jackson]] to [[Guangzhou|Canton]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Yeu4MnVVss0C&pg=PA15&lpg=PA15&dq=outer+passage+route+port+jackson+canton#v=onepage|title=Cinderellas of the Empire: Towards a History of Kiribati and Tuvalu|first=Barrie|last=Macdonald|date=6 December 2001|publisher=editorips@usp.ac.fj|isbn=9789820203358|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref name=LifeMagazine1944-05-22>\n{{cite news |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bk8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA91 |title = The Gilberts & Marshalls: A distinguished historian recalls the past of two recently captured pacific groups |journal= [[Life (magazine)|Life]] |date = 1944-05-22 |author = Samuel Eliot Morison |accessdate = 2009-10-14 |author-link = Samuel Eliot Morison }}</ref>\n\nThe main archipelago was named ''\u00eeles Gilbert'' (''Gilbert Islands'' in English) in about 1820 by Russian admiral [[Adam Johann von Krusenstern|Adam von Krusenstern]] and French captain [[Louis Isidore Duperrey|Louis Duperrey]]. Both of their maps, published in 1820, were written in French. In English, the archipelago, the Southern part notably, was often referred to as the Kingsmills in the 19th century, although the name Gilbert Islands was used increasingly, including in the [[British Western Pacific Territories|Western Pacific Order in Council]] of 1877 and in the Pacific Order of 1893.<ref>[http://www.paclii.org/sb/legis/sb-uk_act/po189395.rtf]</ref>\n\nThe name Gilbert was incorporated into the name of the entire [[Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony]] from 1916 and was retained after the Ellice Islands became the separate nation of [[Tuvalu]] in 1976. The spelling of ''Gilberts'' in the [[Gilbertese language]] as Kiribati may be found in books in Gilbertese prepared by missionaries and others (see e.g. Hawaiian Board of Missionaries, 1895).<ref>{{cite book|author=Hawaiian board of missions, publishers|title=Te Rikitianere ni baibara, ae te boki ni kaoti nanon taeka ianena aika 376 aika n te baibara ni kiribati: ma te kankaotanti ae karako.

Intermarriage tended to blur cultural differences and resulted in a significant degree of cultural homogenisation.<ref name=brit/><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20091014051525/http://www.mfep.gov.ki/Facts%20and%20Background.htm Background Note: Kiribati]. mfep.gov.ki</ref> Local oral historians in the form of chiefly lore keepers suggest that the area was first inhabited by a group of seafaring people from [[Melanesia]], who were described as being dark skinned, frizzy haired and short in stature. These [[indigenous peoples]] were then visited by early [[Austronesian]] seafarers from the west, orally described as being tall and fair skinned. Eventually, both groups intermittently clashed and intermingled until they slowly became a uniform population.\n\nAround 1300 A.D, there was a mass exodus from [[Samoa]] at the same time that [[Cannibalism]] was forcefully abolished there, leading to the addition of Polynesian ancestry into the mix of most I-Kiribati people. These Samoans would later bring strong features of Polynesian languages and culture, creating clans based on their own Samoan traditions and slowly intertwining with the indigenous clans and powers already dominant in Kiribati.\n\nAround the 15th century, with the stark contrasting systems of governance between the Northern Islands, primarily under chiefly rule (Uea), and the Central and Southern Islands, primarily under the rule of their council of elders (Unimwaane)\u2013with the exception of [[Tabiteuea]], the sole island that maintained a traditional [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] society (Tabiteuea stemming from the root phrase Tabu-Te-Uea meaning \"Chiefs are forbidden\")\u2013civil war soon became a factor, with acquisition of land being the main form of conquest. Clans and chiefs began fighting over resources, fuelled by hatred and reignited blood feuds, which may have happened months or decades before. \n\nThe turmoil would last well into the European visitation and colonial era, which led to certain islands decimating their foes with the help of guns and cannon-equipped ships that some Europeans were coerced into using by the more cunning and persuasive among the I-Kiribati leaders. \n\nThe typical military arms of the I-Kiribati at this time were shark-tooth-embedded wooden spears, knives and swords, and garbs of armour fashioned from dense coconut fibre. They chiefly used these instead of the gunpowder and weapons of steel available at the time, because of the strong sentimental value of the equipment handed down through generations. Ranged weapons, such as bows, slings and javelins, were seldom used; [[Culture of Kiribati#Kiribati traditional martial arts|hand-to-hand combat]] was a prominent skill still practised today, though seldom mentioned because of various taboos associated with it, secrecy being the primary one.\n\n[[Abemama]]'s High Chief [[Tembinok']] would be the last of the dozens of expansionist Chiefs of Kiribati of this period, despite Abemama historically conforming to the traditional Southern Island's governance of their respective \u201cunimwaane\u201d. He would be immortalised in [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s book \"In the South Seas\", which delved into the High Chief's character and method of rule during Stevenson's stay in Abemama.\n\n===Colonial Era===\n{{Main|British Western Pacific Territories|Gilbert and Ellice Islands}}\nChance visits by European ships occurred in the 17th and 18th centuries,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Maude, H.

The location of Fanning Island, one of the closest formations to Hawaii, led to its annexation by the British Empire in 1888. Nearby candidates including Palmyra Island were not favored due to the lack of adequate landing sites.\n\n[[File:165th Infantry assault wave attacking Butaritari, Yellow Beach Two, find it slow going in the coral bottom waters.... - NARA - 531172.tif|thumb|165th Infantry assault wave attacking Butaritari, Yellow Beach Two, [[Makin Atoll]], 20 November 1943]] \nThe United States eventually incorporated the Northern Line into its territories, and did the same with the Phoenix Islands, which lie between Kiribati and the Line Islands, including Howland, Jarvis, and Baker islands, thus causing a territorial dispute. That was eventually resolved and they became part of Kiribati under the [[Treaty of Tarawa]]. That was signed shortly after independence and ratified in 1983, the United States relinquishing all claims to the sparsely-inhabited Phoenix Islands, and those of the Line Islands that are part of Kiribati territory.\n\n[[File:Tarawa.jpg|thumb|American Marines assault a Japanese bunker during the [[Battle of Tarawa]], November 1943.]]\n[[Tarawa Atoll]], and others of the Gilbert group, were occupied by Japan from 1941 to 1943, during [[World War II]].

The executive branch consists of a president (''te Beretitenti''), a vice-president and a cabinet. The president, who is also chief of the cabinet, is directly elected by the people, after the legislature nominates three or four persons from among its members to be candidates in the ensuing presidential election. The president is limited in the terms they can serve for to three four-year terms. He remains a member of the Assembly while serving as president. The cabinet is composed of the president, vice-president, and 10 ministers (appointed by the president) who are also members of the House of Assembly.\n\nThe legislative branch is the unicameral ''Maneaba Ni Maungatabu'' (House of Assembly). Its members are elected, including by constitutional mandate a representative of the Banaban people in [[Fiji]] (Banaba Island, former Ocean Island), in addition to the attorney general, who serves as an ''ex-officio'' member. Legislators serve for a four-year term.\n\nThe constitutional provisions governing administration of justice are similar to those in other former British possessions in that the judiciary is free from governmental interference. The judicial branch is made up of the High Court (in Betio) and the Court of Appeal. The president appoints the presiding judges.\n\nLocal government is through island councils with elected members. Local affairs are handled in a manner similar to town meetings in colonial America. Island councils make their own estimates of revenue and expenditure and generally are free from central government controls. There are a total of 21 inhabited islands in Kiribati. Each inhabited island has its own council. Since independence, Kiribati is no longer divided into districts (see [[Districts of Kiribati|Subdivisions of Kiribati]]).\n\nKiribati has formal political parties but their organisation is quite informal. Ad&nbsp;hoc opposition groups tend to coalesce around specific issues. Today the only recognisable parties are the ''Boutokaan te Koaua'' Party, ''Maneaban te Mauri'' Party, ''Maurin Kiribati'' Party and ''Tabomoa'' Party. There is universal suffrage at age 18.\n\n===Foreign relations===\n{{Main|Foreign relations of Kiribati}}\n\nKiribati maintains close relations with its Pacific neighbours, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Fiji. The first three of these provide the bulk of the country's foreign aid. [[Taiwan]] and Japan also have specified-period licences to fish in Kiribati's waters.<ref>{{cite web |title=Background Notes: Kiribati, May 1996|url=https://1997-2001.state.gov/background_notes/kiribati_0596_bgn.html|publisher=U.S. State Department|year=1996|accessdate=February 6, 2018}}</ref> There were four resident diplomatic missions headquartered in Kiribati: the Embassies of the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan) and Cuba and the High Commissions of [[List of Australian High Commissioners to Kiribati|Australia]] and New Zealand.{{when?|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn November 1999 Kiribati agreed to allow Japan's [[National Space Development Agency]] to lease land on [[Kiritimati|Christmas Island]] for 20 years, on which to build a [[spaceport]].<ref name=SpaceDaily2000>{{cite news |title=Kiribati Gives Okay to Christmas Island Spaceport |url=http://www.spacedaily.com/news/japan-hopex-00d.html |newspaper=Space Daily News |date=11 May 2000 |accessdate=28 April 2018}}</ref> The agreement stipulated that Japan was to pay US$840,000 per year and would also pay for any damage to roads and the environment.<ref name=SpaceDaily2000 /> A Japanese-built downrange [[tracking station]] operates on Kiritimati<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fdsn.org/station_book/IU/XMAS/xmas.html |title=FDSN Station Info \u2013 XMAS |publisher = Fdsn.org |date=22 August 1997 |accessdate=14 May 2010}}</ref> and an abandoned airfield on the island was designated as the landing strip for a proposed reusable unmanned [[space shuttle]] called [[HOPE-X]].

Kiribati is a member of the [[Alliance of Small Island States]] (AOSIS), an intergovernmental organisation of low-lying coastal and small island countries.\nEstablished in 1990, the main purpose of the alliance is to consolidate the voices of [[Small Island Developing States]] (SIDS) to address global warming. AOSIS has been very active from its inception, putting forward the first draft text in the [[Kyoto Protocol]] negotiations as early as 1994.\n\nIn 2009, President Tong attended the [[Climate Vulnerable Forum]] ([[Climate Vulnerable Forum|V11]]) in the [[Maldives]], with 10 other countries that are vulnerable to climate change, and signed the Bandos Island declaration on 10 November 2009, pledging to show moral leadership and commence greening their economies by voluntarily committing to achieving [[carbon neutrality]].\n\nIn November 2010, Kiribati hosted the [[Tarawa Climate Change Conference]] (TCCC) to support the president of Kiribati's initiative to hold a consultative forum between vulnerable states and their partners. The conference strove to create an enabling environment for multi-party negotiations under the auspices of the UNFCCC. The conference was a successor event to the Climate Vulnerable Forum.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.climate.gov.ki/tarawa_climate_change_conference.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202030155/http://www.climate.gov.ki/tarawa_climate_change_conference.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 February 2012 |title=Climate Change in Kiribati, Tarawa Climate Change Conference Issues Ambo Declaration |publisher=Office of the President of Kiribati |date=12 November 2010 |accessdate=28 April 2018}}</ref> The ultimate objective of TCCC was to reduce the number and intensity of fault lines between parties to the COP process, explore elements of agreement between the parties and thereby to support Kiribati's and other parties' contribution to [[COP16]] held in [[Cancun]], [[Mexico]], from 29 November to 10 December 2010.\n\nIn 2013, President Tong spoke of climate-change induced sea level rise as \"inevitable\". \"For our people to survive, then they will have to migrate.

Public performances in modern Kiribati are generally performed by a seated chorus, accompanied by a guitar. However, during formal performances of the standing dance (''Te Kaimatoa'') or the hip dance (''Te Buki''), a wooden box is used as a percussion instrument. This box is constructed to give a hollow and reverberating tone when struck simultaneously by a chorus of men sitting around it. Traditional songs are often love-themed, but there are also competitive, religious, children's, patriotic, war and wedding songs. There are also [[tirere|stick dance]]s which accompany legends and semi-historical stories {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. These stick dances or \"tirere\" (pronounced seerere) are performed only during major festivals.\n\n===Dance===\n{{main|Dance in Kiribati}}\n[[File:Bonriki International Airport welcome.jpg|thumb|A welcome display.]]\nThe uniqueness of Kiribati when compared with other forms of Pacific island dance is its emphasis on the outstretched arms of the dancer and the sudden birdlike movement of the head. The [[Great frigatebird|Frigate bird]] (''Fregata minor'') on the Kiribati flag refers to this bird-like style of Kiribati dancing. Most dances are in the standing or sitting position with movement limited and staggered. Smiling whilst dancing is generally considered vulgar within the context of Kiribati dancing. This is due to its origin of not being solely as a form of entertainment but as a form of storytelling and a display of the skill, beauty and endurance of the dancer.<ref>[[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s ''In the South Seas'' and the [[Montana New Zealand Book Awards]] winner ''Akekeia!'' by Tony & Joan Whincup, Wellington, 2001.</ref>\n\n===Sport===\n{{see also|Kiribati at the Olympics|Kiribati at the 2014 Commonwealth Games}}\nKiribati has competed at the [[Commonwealth Games]] since [[1998 Commonwealth Games|1998]] and the [[Summer Olympics]] since [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]].

Kiribati's easternmost islands, the southern Line Islands, south of [[Hawaii]], have the most advanced time on Earth: [[UTC+14:00|UTC+14]] hours. Kiribati is the only country in the world to be situated in all four hemispheres.\n\nKiribati gained its independence from the [[United Kingdom]], becoming  a [[sovereign state]] in 1979. The capital, [[South Tarawa]], now the most populated area, consists of a number of islets, connected by a series of [[causeway]]s. These comprise about half the area of [[Tarawa]] Atoll.\n\nKiribati is a member of the [[Pacific Community]] (SPC), [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], and the [[World Bank]], and became a full member of the [[United Nations]] in 1999.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Kiribati'' was adopted in 1979 at independence. It is the [[Gilbertese]] rendition of ''Gilberts''. This name derives from the English pronunciation of the name of the main archipelago that forms the nation. It was named in 1820 by [[Adam Johann von Krusenstern]] as \u00ab \u00eeles Gilbert \u00bb, in English the [[Gilbert Islands]], after the British [[Sea captain|captain]] [[Thomas Gilbert (sea captain)|Thomas Gilbert]]. He and captain [[John Marshall (Royal Navy officer)|John Marshall]] sighted some of the islands in 1788, while crossing the Outer Passage route from [[Port Jackson]] to [[Guangzhou|Canton]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Yeu4MnVVss0C&pg=PA15&lpg=PA15&dq=outer+passage+route+port+jackson+canton#v=onepage|title=Cinderellas of the Empire: Towards a History of Kiribati and Tuvalu|first=Barrie|last=Macdonald|date=6 December 2001|publisher=editorips@usp.ac.fj|isbn=9789820203358|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref name=LifeMagazine1944-05-22>\n{{cite news |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bk8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA91 |title = The Gilberts & Marshalls: A distinguished historian recalls the past of two recently captured pacific groups |journal= [[Life (magazine)|Life]] |date = 1944-05-22 |author = Samuel Eliot Morison |accessdate = 2009-10-14 |author-link = Samuel Eliot Morison }}</ref>\n\nThe main archipelago was named ''\u00eeles Gilbert'' (''Gilbert Islands'' in English) in about 1820 by Russian admiral [[Adam Johann von Krusenstern|Adam von Krusenstern]] and French captain [[Louis Isidore Duperrey|Louis Duperrey]]. Both of their maps, published in 1820, were written in French. In English, the archipelago, the Southern part notably, was often referred to as the Kingsmills in the 19th century, although the name Gilbert Islands was used increasingly, including in the [[British Western Pacific Territories|Western Pacific Order in Council]] of 1877 and in the Pacific Order of 1893.<ref>[http://www.paclii.org/sb/legis/sb-uk_act/po189395.rtf]</ref>\n\nThe name Gilbert was incorporated into the name of the entire [[Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony]] from 1916 and was retained after the Ellice Islands became the separate nation of [[Tuvalu]] in 1976. The spelling of ''Gilberts'' in the [[Gilbertese language]] as Kiribati may be found in books in Gilbertese prepared by missionaries and others (see e.g. Hawaiian Board of Missionaries, 1895).<ref>{{cite book|author=Hawaiian board of missions, publishers|title=Te Rikitianere ni baibara, ae te boki ni kaoti nanon taeka ianena aika 376 aika n te baibara ni kiribati: ma te kankaotanti ae karako.

These [[indigenous peoples]] were then visited by early [[Austronesian]] seafarers from the west, orally described as being tall and fair skinned. Eventually, both groups intermittently clashed and intermingled until they slowly became a uniform population.\n\nAround 1300 A.D, there was a mass exodus from [[Samoa]] at the same time that [[Cannibalism]] was forcefully abolished there, leading to the addition of Polynesian ancestry into the mix of most I-Kiribati people. These Samoans would later bring strong features of Polynesian languages and culture, creating clans based on their own Samoan traditions and slowly intertwining with the indigenous clans and powers already dominant in Kiribati.\n\nAround the 15th century, with the stark contrasting systems of governance between the Northern Islands, primarily under chiefly rule (Uea), and the Central and Southern Islands, primarily under the rule of their council of elders (Unimwaane)\u2013with the exception of [[Tabiteuea]], the sole island that maintained a traditional [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] society (Tabiteuea stemming from the root phrase Tabu-Te-Uea meaning \"Chiefs are forbidden\")\u2013civil war soon became a factor, with acquisition of land being the main form of conquest. Clans and chiefs began fighting over resources, fuelled by hatred and reignited blood feuds, which may have happened months or decades before. \n\nThe turmoil would last well into the European visitation and colonial era, which led to certain islands decimating their foes with the help of guns and cannon-equipped ships that some Europeans were coerced into using by the more cunning and persuasive among the I-Kiribati leaders. \n\nThe typical military arms of the I-Kiribati at this time were shark-tooth-embedded wooden spears, knives and swords, and garbs of armour fashioned from dense coconut fibre. They chiefly used these instead of the gunpowder and weapons of steel available at the time, because of the strong sentimental value of the equipment handed down through generations. Ranged weapons, such as bows, slings and javelins, were seldom used; [[Culture of Kiribati#Kiribati traditional martial arts|hand-to-hand combat]] was a prominent skill still practised today, though seldom mentioned because of various taboos associated with it, secrecy being the primary one.\n\n[[Abemama]]'s High Chief [[Tembinok']] would be the last of the dozens of expansionist Chiefs of Kiribati of this period, despite Abemama historically conforming to the traditional Southern Island's governance of their respective \u201cunimwaane\u201d. He would be immortalised in [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s book \"In the South Seas\", which delved into the High Chief's character and method of rule during Stevenson's stay in Abemama.\n\n===Colonial Era===\n{{Main|British Western Pacific Territories|Gilbert and Ellice Islands}}\nChance visits by European ships occurred in the 17th and 18th centuries,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Maude, H.

The executive branch consists of a president (''te Beretitenti''), a vice-president and a cabinet. The president, who is also chief of the cabinet, is directly elected by the people, after the legislature nominates three or four persons from among its members to be candidates in the ensuing presidential election. The president is limited in the terms they can serve for to three four-year terms. He remains a member of the Assembly while serving as president. The cabinet is composed of the president, vice-president, and 10 ministers (appointed by the president) who are also members of the House of Assembly.\n\nThe legislative branch is the unicameral ''Maneaba Ni Maungatabu'' (House of Assembly). Its members are elected, including by constitutional mandate a representative of the Banaban people in [[Fiji]] (Banaba Island, former Ocean Island), in addition to the attorney general, who serves as an ''ex-officio'' member. Legislators serve for a four-year term.\n\nThe constitutional provisions governing administration of justice are similar to those in other former British possessions in that the judiciary is free from governmental interference. The judicial branch is made up of the High Court (in Betio) and the Court of Appeal. The president appoints the presiding judges.\n\nLocal government is through island councils with elected members. Local affairs are handled in a manner similar to town meetings in colonial America. Island councils make their own estimates of revenue and expenditure and generally are free from central government controls. There are a total of 21 inhabited islands in Kiribati. Each inhabited island has its own council. Since independence, Kiribati is no longer divided into districts (see [[Districts of Kiribati|Subdivisions of Kiribati]]).\n\nKiribati has formal political parties but their organisation is quite informal. Ad&nbsp;hoc opposition groups tend to coalesce around specific issues. Today the only recognisable parties are the ''Boutokaan te Koaua'' Party, ''Maneaban te Mauri'' Party, ''Maurin Kiribati'' Party and ''Tabomoa'' Party. There is universal suffrage at age 18.\n\n===Foreign relations===\n{{Main|Foreign relations of Kiribati}}\n\nKiribati maintains close relations with its Pacific neighbours, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Fiji.

Kiribati is a member of the [[Alliance of Small Island States]] (AOSIS), an intergovernmental organisation of low-lying coastal and small island countries.\nEstablished in 1990, the main purpose of the alliance is to consolidate the voices of [[Small Island Developing States]] (SIDS) to address global warming. AOSIS has been very active from its inception, putting forward the first draft text in the [[Kyoto Protocol]] negotiations as early as 1994.\n\nIn 2009, President Tong attended the [[Climate Vulnerable Forum]] ([[Climate Vulnerable Forum|V11]]) in the [[Maldives]], with 10 other countries that are vulnerable to climate change, and signed the Bandos Island declaration on 10 November 2009, pledging to show moral leadership and commence greening their economies by voluntarily committing to achieving [[carbon neutrality]].\n\nIn November 2010, Kiribati hosted the [[Tarawa Climate Change Conference]] (TCCC) to support the president of Kiribati's initiative to hold a consultative forum between vulnerable states and their partners. The conference strove to create an enabling environment for multi-party negotiations under the auspices of the UNFCCC.

Commercially viable [[phosphate]] deposits on [[Banaba Island|Banaba]] were exhausted at the time of independence. [[Copra]] and fish now represent the bulk of production and exports. Kiribati is considered one of the [[Least developed country|least developed countries]] in the world.\n\nIn one form or another, Kiribati gets a large portion of its income from abroad. Examples include fishing licenses, development assistance, worker [[remittance]]s, and tourism. Given Kiribati's limited domestic production ability, it must import nearly all of its essential foodstuffs and manufactured items; it depends on these external sources of income for financing.\n\nThe economy of Kiribati benefits from international development assistance programs. The multilateral donors providing development assistance in 2009 were the [[European Union]] (A$9 million), the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (A$3.7 million), UNICEF, and the [[World Health Organization]] (A$100,000).<ref name=\"IMF 2011 SA\"/> The bilateral donors providing development assistance in 2009 were Australia (A$11 million), Japan (A$2 million), [[New Zealand]] (A$6.6 million), [[Taiwan]] (A$10.6 million), and other donors providing A$16.2 million, including technical assistance grants from the [[Asian Development Bank]].<ref name=\"IMF 2011 SA\">{{cite web |title = Kiribati: Statistical Appendix |url = https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=24872.0 |publisher = International Monetary Fund Country Report No. 11/114 |date = 24 May 2011 |accessdate = 10 September 2011 }}</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |title = Kiribati: 2011 Article IV Consultation-Staff Report, Informational Annexes, Debt Sustainability Analysis, Public Information Notice on the Executive Board Discussion, and Statement by the Executive Director for Kiribati |url = https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=24871.0 |publisher = International Monetary Fund Country Report No. 11/113 |date = 24 May 2011 |accessdate = 10 September 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe major donors in 2010/2011 were Australia (A$15 million), Taiwan (A$11 million); New Zealand (A$6 million), the [[World Bank]] (A$4 million) and the [[Asian Development Bank]].<ref name=mfat>{{cite web |url = http://www.mfat.govt.nz/Countries/Pacific/Kiribati.php |title = New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) |accessdate = 10 September 2010 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1956, Kiribati established a [[sovereign wealth fund]] to act as a store of wealth for the country's earnings from [[phosphate]] mining.\nIn 2008, the [[Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund]] was valued at US$400 million.<ref>[http://www.swfinstitute.org/fund/kiribati.php Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute].

It is estimated to have grown by 1.75% for the year. Despite a weather-related drop in copra production, private sector activity appears to have picked up, especially in retail. Tourist arrivals rebounded by 20% compared to 2009, although from a very low base.\nDespite the rise in world food and fuel prices, inflation has bounced from 2008 crisis-highs into negative territory, reflecting the strong appreciation of the Australian dollar, which is used as the domestic currency, and a decline in the world price of rice. Credit growth in the overall economy declined in 2009 as economic activity stalled.

Most houses are made of materials obtained from coconut and pandanus trees. Frequent droughts and infertile soil hinder reliable large-scale agriculture, so the islanders have largely turned to the sea for livelihood and subsistence. Most are outrigger sailors and fishermen. Copra plantations serve as a second source of employment. In recent years large numbers of citizens have moved to the more urban island capital of Tarawa. Increasing urbanisation has raised the population of South Tarawa to 50,182.<ref name=\"IMF 2011\"/>{{page needed|date=August 2017}}\n[[File:Landscape, Kiribati, 2011.

Ethnically, the I-Kiribati are [[Micronesia]]ns. Recent archaeological evidence indicates that [[Austronesians]] originally settled the islands thousands of years ago. Around the 14th century, Fijians, Samoans, and Tongans invaded the islands, thus diversifying the ethnic range and introducing [[Polynesian languages|Polynesian]] linguistic traits. Intermarriage among all ancestral groups, however, has led to a population reasonably homogeneous in appearance and traditions.\n\n=== Languages ===\nThe people of Kiribati speak an [[Oceanic languages|Oceanic language]] called [[Gilbertese language|Gilbertese]]. Although English is also an [[official language]], it is not used very often outside the island capital of [[Tarawa]]. It is more likely that English is mixed in its use with Gilbertese. Older generations of I-Kiribati tend to use more complicated versions of the language. Several words in Gilbertese have been adopted from European settlers, for instance, ''kamea'' is the Gilbertese word for dog,<ref>[http://www.trussel.com/kir/glossary.htm Te taetae ni Kiribati \u2013 Kiribati Language Lessons \u2013 Glossary].

Public performances in modern Kiribati are generally performed by a seated chorus, accompanied by a guitar. However, during formal performances of the standing dance (''Te Kaimatoa'') or the hip dance (''Te Buki''), a wooden box is used as a percussion instrument. This box is constructed to give a hollow and reverberating tone when struck simultaneously by a chorus of men sitting around it. Traditional songs are often love-themed, but there are also competitive, religious, children's, patriotic, war and wedding songs. There are also [[tirere|stick dance]]s which accompany legends and semi-historical stories {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. These stick dances or \"tirere\" (pronounced seerere) are performed only during major festivals.\n\n===Dance===\n{{main|Dance in Kiribati}}\n[[File:Bonriki International Airport welcome.jpg|thumb|A welcome display.]]\nThe uniqueness of Kiribati when compared with other forms of Pacific island dance is its emphasis on the outstretched arms of the dancer and the sudden birdlike movement of the head. The [[Great frigatebird|Frigate bird]] (''Fregata minor'') on the Kiribati flag refers to this bird-like style of Kiribati dancing. Most dances are in the standing or sitting position with movement limited and staggered. Smiling whilst dancing is generally considered vulgar within the context of Kiribati dancing. This is due to its origin of not being solely as a form of entertainment but as a form of storytelling and a display of the skill, beauty and endurance of the dancer.<ref>[[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s ''In the South Seas'' and the [[Montana New Zealand Book Awards]] winner ''Akekeia!'' by Tony & Joan Whincup, Wellington, 2001.</ref>\n\n===Sport===\n{{see also|Kiribati at the Olympics|Kiribati at the 2014 Commonwealth Games}}\nKiribati has competed at the [[Commonwealth Games]] since [[1998 Commonwealth Games|1998]] and the [[Summer Olympics]] since [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]].

It was written by [[Paul McCartney]] and credited to the [[Lennon\u2013McCartney]] partnership. The single was the Beatles' first release on their [[Apple Records|Apple]] record label and one of the \"First Four\" singles marking the label's public launch. \"Hey Jude\" topped record charts around the world and was the best-selling single of 1968 in the UK, the US, Australia and Canada. At more than seven minutes in length, it was the longest single that ever topped the British charts,{{sfn|Lowry|2002|p=44}} and it is frequently included on critics' lists of the greatest songs of all time.\n\nThe making of \"Hey Jude\" coincided with a period of upheaval in the Beatles. After [[John Lennon]] left his wife for the Japanese artist [[Yoko Ono]], McCartney conceived the [[ballad]], originally as \"Hey Jules\", to comfort Lennon's son [[Julian Lennon|Julian]]. The lyrics espouse a positive outlook on a sad situation and encourages \"Jude\" to pursue his opportunities to find love. After the fourth verse, the song shifts to a fade-out [[Coda (music)|coda]] that lasts over four minutes. This consists of the band and orchestral players singing a \"Na-na-na na, hey Jude\" vocal phrase over the song's [[plagal cadence|double-plagal cadence]] chord pattern, repeated 19 times.\n\n\"Hey Jude\" was the first Beatles song recorded on [[eight-track recording]] equipment. Sessions took place at [[Trident Studios]] in London, midway through the recording of the group's [[The Beatles (album)|self-titled double album]] (also known as \"the White Album\"). Arguments ensued between [[George Harrison]] and McCartney over Harrison's guitar part. Producer [[George Martin]] arranged a score for a 36-piece orchestra, conducted by McCartney. [[Ringo Starr]] later left the band only to return shortly before they filmed the promotional clip for the single. The clip, directed by [[Michael Lindsay-Hogg]], first aired on [[David Frost]]'s UK television show, and featured the studio audience joining the band onstage as they sang the coda, capturing the song's theme of optimism and togetherness.\n\nThe arrangement and extended coda encouraged many imitative works through to the early 1970s. By November 1968, the single had sold approximately six million copies worldwide, and its nine-week run at number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] tied the all-time record in 1968 for the longest run at the top of the US charts. In 2013, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine named it the 10th \"biggest\" song of all time in terms of chart success.<ref name=\"Bronson\">{{cite magazine|first= Fred |last= Bronson |title= Hot 100 55th Anniversary: The All-Time Top 100 Songs |magazine= [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date= 2 August 2012 |accessdate= 9 August 2013 |url= http://www.billboard.com/articles/list/2155531/the-hot-100-all-time-top-songs?list_page=9 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170710144317/http://www.billboard.com/articles/list/2155531/the-hot-100-all-time-top-songs?list_page=9 |archivedate= 10 July 2017 |url-status= live}}</ref> McCartney continues to perform \"Hey Jude\" in concert since [[Murder of John Lennon|Lennon's death in 1980]], leading audiences in singing the coda.

Tim Riley writes that, with the \"restrained tom-tom and cymbal fill\" that introduces the drum part, \"the piano shifts downward to add a flat seventh to the tonic chord, making the downbeat of the bridge the point of arrival ('And any time you feel the ''pain''{{'}}).\"{{sfn|Riley|2002|p=252}} At the end of each bridge, McCartney sings a brief phrase (\"Na-na-na na \u2026\"), supported by an electric guitar fill,{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=194}} before playing a piano fill that leads to the next verse. According to Riley, this vocal phrase serves to \"reorient the harmony for the verse as the piano figure turns upside down into a vocal aside\". Additional musical details, such as tambourine on the third verse and subtle harmonies accompanying the lead vocal, are added to sustain interest throughout the four-verse, two-bridge song.{{sfn|Riley|2002|p=253}}\n\nThe verse-bridge structure persists for approximately three minutes, after which the band leads into a four-minute-long coda, consisting of nineteen rounds of the song's double [[plagal cadence]].{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=192}} During this coda, the rest of the band, backed by an orchestra that also provides backing vocals, repeats the phrase \"Na-na-na na\" followed by the words \"hey Jude\" until the song gradually fades out.{{refn|group=nb|Author [[John Kruth]] writes that McCartney might have taken the idea for the closing refrain from [[Cannibal & the Headhunters]]' 1965 hit \"[[Land of a Thousand Dances]]\", the main [[Hook (music)|hook]] of which is a series of \"extended 'nah nah nah nah nahs'\". This band, whom McCartney nicknamed \"the Nah Nah Boys\", were his choice for the Beatles' support act on their [[The Beatles' 1965 US tour|1965 US tour]].{{sfn|Kruth|2015|pp=22\u201323}}}} In his analysis of the composition, musicologist [[Alan W.

band [[the Beatles]] that was released as a non-album single on 26 August 1968. It was written by [[Paul McCartney]] and credited to the [[Lennon\u2013McCartney]] partnership. The single was the Beatles' first release on their [[Apple Records|Apple]] record label and one of the \"First Four\" singles marking the label's public launch. \"Hey Jude\" topped record charts around the world and was the best-selling single of 1968 in the UK, the US, Australia and Canada. At more than seven minutes in length, it was the longest single that ever topped the British charts,{{sfn|Lowry|2002|p=44}} and it is frequently included on critics' lists of the greatest songs of all time.\n\nThe making of \"Hey Jude\" coincided with a period of upheaval in the Beatles. After [[John Lennon]] left his wife for the Japanese artist [[Yoko Ono]], McCartney conceived the [[ballad]], originally as \"Hey Jules\", to comfort Lennon's son [[Julian Lennon|Julian]]. The lyrics espouse a positive outlook on a sad situation and encourages \"Jude\" to pursue his opportunities to find love. After the fourth verse, the song shifts to a fade-out [[Coda (music)|coda]] that lasts over four minutes. This consists of the band and orchestral players singing a \"Na-na-na na, hey Jude\" vocal phrase over the song's [[plagal cadence|double-plagal cadence]] chord pattern, repeated 19 times.\n\n\"Hey Jude\" was the first Beatles song recorded on [[eight-track recording]] equipment. Sessions took place at [[Trident Studios]] in London, midway through the recording of the group's [[The Beatles (album)|self-titled double album]] (also known as \"the White Album\"). Arguments ensued between [[George Harrison]] and McCartney over Harrison's guitar part. Producer [[George Martin]] arranged a score for a 36-piece orchestra, conducted by McCartney. [[Ringo Starr]] later left the band only to return shortly before they filmed the promotional clip for the single. The clip, directed by [[Michael Lindsay-Hogg]], first aired on [[David Frost]]'s UK television show, and featured the studio audience joining the band onstage as they sang the coda, capturing the song's theme of optimism and togetherness.\n\nThe arrangement and extended coda encouraged many imitative works through to the early 1970s. By November 1968, the single had sold approximately six million copies worldwide, and its nine-week run at number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] tied the all-time record in 1968 for the longest run at the top of the US charts. In 2013, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine named it the 10th \"biggest\" song of all time in terms of chart success.<ref name=\"Bronson\">{{cite magazine|first= Fred |last= Bronson |title= Hot 100 55th Anniversary: The All-Time Top 100 Songs |magazine= [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date= 2 August 2012 |accessdate= 9 August 2013 |url= http://www.billboard.com/articles/list/2155531/the-hot-100-all-time-top-songs?list_page=9 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170710144317/http://www.billboard.com/articles/list/2155531/the-hot-100-all-time-top-songs?list_page=9 |archivedate= 10 July 2017 |url-status= live}}</ref> McCartney continues to perform \"Hey Jude\" in concert since [[Murder of John Lennon|Lennon's death in 1980]], leading audiences in singing the coda.

Tim Riley writes that, with the \"restrained tom-tom and cymbal fill\" that introduces the drum part, \"the piano shifts downward to add a flat seventh to the tonic chord, making the downbeat of the bridge the point of arrival ('And any time you feel the ''pain''{{'}}).\"{{sfn|Riley|2002|p=252}} At the end of each bridge, McCartney sings a brief phrase (\"Na-na-na na \u2026\"), supported by an electric guitar fill,{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=194}} before playing a piano fill that leads to the next verse. According to Riley, this vocal phrase serves to \"reorient the harmony for the verse as the piano figure turns upside down into a vocal aside\". Additional musical details, such as tambourine on the third verse and subtle harmonies accompanying the lead vocal, are added to sustain interest throughout the four-verse, two-bridge song.{{sfn|Riley|2002|p=253}}\n\nThe verse-bridge structure persists for approximately three minutes, after which the band leads into a four-minute-long coda, consisting of nineteen rounds of the song's double [[plagal cadence]].{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=192}} During this coda, the rest of the band, backed by an orchestra that also provides backing vocals, repeats the phrase \"Na-na-na na\" followed by the words \"hey Jude\" until the song gradually fades out.{{refn|group=nb|Author [[John Kruth]] writes that McCartney might have taken the idea for the closing refrain from [[Cannibal & the Headhunters]]' 1965 hit \"[[Land of a Thousand Dances]]\", the main [[Hook (music)|hook]] of which is a series of \"extended 'nah nah nah nah nahs'\". This band, whom McCartney nicknamed \"the Nah Nah Boys\", were his choice for the Beatles' support act on their [[The Beatles' 1965 US tour|1965 US tour]].{{sfn|Kruth|2015|pp=22\u201323}}}} In his analysis of the composition, musicologist [[Alan W. Pollack|Alan Pollack]] comments on the unusual structure of \"Hey Jude\", in that it uses a \"binary form that combines a fully developed, hymn-like song together with an extended, [[mantra]]-like jam on a simple chord progression\".<ref name=\"Pollack\"/>\n\nRiley considers that the coda's repeated chord sequence (I\u2013{{music|flat}}VII\u2013IV\u2013I) \"answers all the musical questions raised at the beginnings and ends of bridges\", since \"The flat seventh that posed dominant turns into bridges now has an entire chord built on it.\" This three-chord refrain allows McCartney \"a bedding ... to leap about on vocally\",{{sfn|Riley|2002|p=254}} so he ad-libs his vocal performance for the rest of the song. In Riley's estimation, the song \"becomes a tour of Paul's vocal range: from the graceful inviting tones of the opening verse, through the mounting excitement of the song itself, to the surging raves of the coda\".{{sfn|Riley|2002|p=255}}\n\n==Release==\n{{quote box|quote=[The Beatles] are confident and cheerful and the human condition will be thrilled by the coming results of their willing and enduring Beatle bondage \u2026 they will give all of us new wonders to soothe our pain.{{sfn|Doggett|2011|pp=49, 359}}|source=\u2013 [[Derek Taylor]], \"Hey Jude\" press release, August 1968|width=25%|align=right|style=padding:8px;}}\n\"Hey Jude\" was released on 26 August 1968 in the United States and 30 August in the United Kingdom,{{sfn|Castleman|Podrazik|1976|pp=67\u201368}} backed with \"[[Revolution (Beatles song)|Revolution]]\" on the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] of a 7-inch single.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=200}} It was one of four singles issued simultaneously to launch Apple Records \u2013 the others being Mary Hopkin's \"[[Those Were the Days (song)|Those Were the Days]]\", Jackie Lomax's \"[[Sour Milk Sea]]\", and the Black Dyke Mills Band's \"Thingumybob\".{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=306}} In advance of the release date, Apple declared 11\u201318 August to be \"National Apple Week\" in the UK,{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=306}}<ref>Black, Johnny. \"A Slice of History\".

RP-1 has a lower [[specific impulse]] than [[liquid hydrogen]] (LH<sub>2</sub>), but is cheaper, stable at room temperature, far less of an explosion hazard, and far denser. RP-1 is significantly more powerful than LH<sub>2</sub> by volume. RP-1 also has a fraction of the [[toxicity]] and [[carcinogen]]ic hazards of [[hydrazine]], another room-temperature liquid fuel.  \n[[File:RP-1 .jpg| thumb |About 2 L of RP-1]]\n\n==Usage and history==\n\nRP-1 is most commonly burned with LOX ([[liquid oxygen]]) as the oxidizer, though other oxidizers have also been used. RP-1 is a fuel in the first-stage boosters of the [[Soyuz-FG]], [[Zenit (rocket family)|Zenit]], [[Delta rocket|Delta I-III]], [[Atlas (rocket)|Atlas]], [[Falcon 9]], [[Antares rocket|Antares]], and [[Tronador (rocket)|Tronador II]] rockets. It also powered the first stages of the [[Energia]], [[Titan I]], [[Saturn I (rocket)|Saturn I and IB]], and [[Saturn V]]. The [[ISRO|Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO)]] is also developing an RP-1 fueled engine for its future rockets.<ref>[http://www.isro.org/sites/default/files/AnnualReports/2014/STS.html Semi-cryogenic Project] ISRO Annual Report 2013 - 2014</ref>\n\nDuring and immediately after World War II, [[alcohol]]s (primarily [[ethanol]], occasionally [[methanol]]) were the most common fuels for large [[Liquid-fuel rocket|liquid-fueled rockets]].  Their high [[heat of vaporization]] kept [[Regenerative cooling (rocket)|regeneratively-cooled]] engines from melting, especially considering that alcohols would typically contain several percent water.  However, it was recognized that [[hydrocarbon]] fuels would increase engine efficiency, due to a slightly higher density, the lack of an [[oxygen]] atom in the fuel molecule, and negligible water content.  Whatever hydrocarbon was chosen, though, would have to replicate alcohol's coolant ability.\n\nMany early rockets burned kerosene, but as burn times, combustion efficiencies, and combustion-chamber pressures increased, engine masses decreased, which led to unmanageable engine temperatures.  Raw kerosene used as coolant tends to [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociate]] and [[Polymerization|polymerize]].  Lightweight products in the form of gas bubbles cause cavitation, and heavy ones in the form of wax deposits block narrow cooling passages in the engine.  The resulting coolant starvation raises temperatures further, and causes more polymerization which accelerates breakdown. The cycle rapidly escalates (i.e. [[thermal runaway]]) until an engine wall rupture or other mechanical failure occurs, and it persists even when the entire coolant flow consists of kerosene. In the mid-1950s rocket designers turned to the chemical engineers to formulate a heat-resistant hydrocarbon, with the result being RP-1.\n\n==Fractions and formulation==\n\nFirst, [[sulfur]] compounds were [[Hydrodesulfurization|severely restricted]].  Small amounts of sulfur are naturally present in fossil fuels.  It was known that sulfur and sulfur compounds attack metals at high temperatures.  In addition, even small amounts of sulfur [[Vulcanization|assist polymerization]].\n\n[[Alkenes]] and [[aromatics]] were held to very low levels.  These unsaturated hydrocarbons tend to polymerize not only at temperature, but during long periods of storage.  At the time, it was thought that kerosene-fueled missiles might remain in storage for years awaiting activation.  This function was later transferred to [[solid-fuel rocket]]s, though the high-temperature benefits of saturated hydrocarbons remained.  Because of the low alkenes and aromatics, RP-1 is less toxic than various jet and diesel fuels, and far less toxic than [[gasoline]].\n\nThe more desirable [[isomer]]s were selected or synthesized.  [[Linear alkane]]s were removed in favor of highly branched and cyclic molecules.  This increased resistance to thermal breakdown, much as these isomer types improve [[octane rating]] in piston engines.  Jet engines and heating and lighting applications, the prior users of kerosene, had been much less concerned with thermal breakdown and isomer contents.  The most desirable isomers were polycyclics, loosely resembling [[ladderane]]s.\n\nIn production, these grades were processed tightly to remove impurities and side fractions. Ashes were feared likely to block fuel lines and engine passages, as well as wear away valves and [[turbopump]] bearings lubricated by the fuel. Slightly too-heavy or too-light fractions affected lubrication abilities and were likely to separate during storage and under load.  The remaining hydrocarbons are at or near C<sub>12</sub> mass.  Because of the lack of light hydrocarbons, RP-1 has a high [[flash point]] and is less of a fire hazard than [[gasoline]]/[[petrol]] or even some jet and diesel fuels.\n\nAll told, the final product is more expensive than straight-run kerosene.  On paper, any petroleum can produce some RP-1 with enough processing.  In practice, the fuel is sourced from a small number of oil fields with high-quality base stock.  This, coupled with small demand in a niche market compared to other petroleum users, drives the price.\nMilitary specifications of RP-1 are covered in MIL-R-25576,<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |url=http://www.braeunig.us/space/propel.htm |title=Basics of Space Flight: Rocket Propellants |publisher=Braeunig.us |date= |accessdate=2012-12-11}}</ref> and the chemical and physical properties of RP-1 are described in NISTIR 6646.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/IR/nistir6646.pdf | title=Thermophysical Properties Measurements and Models for Rocket Propellant RP-1: Phase I (NISTIR 6646)}}</ref>\n\nSoviet and Russian rocket-grade kerosenes are very similar to RP-1 and are designated T-1 and RG-1. Densities are higher, 0.82 to 0.85&nbsp;[[gram per litre|g/ml]], compared to RP-1 at 0.81&nbsp;g/ml.  For a short period, the Soviets achieved even higher densities by super-chilling the kerosene in a rocket\u2019s fuel tanks, but this partially defeated the purpose of using kerosene over other super-chilled fuels.  In the case of the [[Soyuz (rocket family)|Soyuz]] and other [[R-7 Semyorka|R7]]-based rockets, the temperature penalty was minor.  Facilities were already in place to manage the vehicle's cryogenic [[liquid oxygen]] and [[liquid nitrogen]], both of which are far colder than the kerosene temperature.  The launcher's central kerosene tank is surrounded on four sides and the top by liquid-oxygen tanks; the liquid-nitrogen tank is nearby at the bottom.  The kerosene tanks of the four boosters are relatively small and compact, and also between a liquid-oxygen and a liquid-nitrogen tank.  Thus, once the kerosene was chilled initially, it could remain so for the brief time needed to finish launch preparations. The latest version of Falcon 9, [[Falcon 9 Full Thrust]], also has the capability of sub-cooling the RP-1 fuel to \u22127&nbsp;\u00b0C, giving a 2.5\u20134% density increase.\n\n==Comparison with other fuels==\nChemically, a hydrocarbon propellant is less efficient than hydrogen fuel because hydrogen releases more energy per unit mass during combustion, enabling a higher exhaust velocity. This is, in part, a result of the high mass of carbon atoms relative to hydrogen atoms.  Hydrocarbon engines are also typically run fuel-rich, which produces some [[Carbon monoxide|CO]] instead of CO<sub>2</sub> as a consequence of incomplete combustion, although this is not unique to hydrocarbon engines, as hydrogen engines are also typically run fuel-rich for the best overall performance. Some Russian engines run their turbopump preburners oxygen-rich, but the main combustion chamber is still run fuel-rich. All told, kerosene engines generate a [[Specific impulse|''I''<sub>sp</sub>]] in the range of 270 to 360&nbsp;seconds, while hydrogen engines achieve 370 to 465&nbsp;seconds.\n\nDuring engine shutdown, fuel flow goes to zero rapidly, while the engine is still quite hot.  Residual and trapped fuel can polymerize or even [[Carbonization|carbonize]] at hot spots or in hot components.  Even without hot spots, heavy fuels can create a petroleum residue, as can be seen in gasoline, diesel, or jet fuel tanks that have been in service for years. Rocket engines have cycle lifetimes measured in minutes or even seconds, preventing truly heavy deposits.  However, rockets are much more sensitive to a deposit, as described above. Thus, kerosene systems generally entail more teardowns and overhauls, creating operations and labor expenses.  This is a problem for expendable engines, as well as reusable ones, because engines must be ground-fired some number of times before launch.  Even cold-flow tests, in which the propellants are not ignited, can leave residues.\n\nOn the upside, below a chamber pressure of about 1000&nbsp;psi (6.9&nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|MPa]]), kerosene can produce sooty deposits on the inside of the nozzle and chamber liner. This acts as a significant insulation layer and can reduce the heat flow into the wall by roughly a factor of two. Most modern hydrocarbon engines, however, run above this pressure, therefore this is not a significant effect for most engines.\n\nRecent heavy-hydrocarbon engines have modified components and new operating cycles, in attempts to better manage leftover fuel, achieve a more-gradual cooldown, or both.  This still leaves the problem of non-dissociated petroleum residue.  Other new engines have tried to bypass the problem entirely, by switching to light hydrocarbons such as [[methane]] or [[propane]] gas.  Both are volatiles, so engine residues simply evaporate.  If necessary, solvents or other purgatives can be run through the engine to finish dispersion.  The short-chain carbon backbone of propane (a C<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;molecule) is very difficult to break; methane, with a single carbon atom (C<sub>1</sub>), is technically not a chain at all.  The breakdown products of both molecules are also gases, with fewer problems due to phase separation, and much less likelihood of polymerization and deposition.  However, methane (and to a lesser extent propane) reintroduces handling inconveniences that prompted kerosenes in the first place.\n\nThe low [[vapor pressure]] of kerosenes gives safety for ground crews.  However, in flight the kerosene tank needs a separate pressurization system to replace fuel volume as it drains.  Generally, this is a separate tank of liquid or high-pressure inert gas, such as [[nitrogen]] or [[helium]].  This creates extra cost and weight.  [[Cryogenics|Cryogenic]] or volatile propellants generally do not need a separate pressurant; instead, some propellant is expanded (often with engine heat) into low-density gas and routed back to its tank.  A few highly volatile propellant designs do not even need the gas loop; some of the liquid automatically vaporizes to fill its own container.  Some rockets use gas from a [[gas generator]] to pressurize the fuel tank; usually, this is exhaust from a [[turbopump]].  Although this saves the weight of a separate gas system, the loop now has to handle a hot, reactive gas instead of a cool, inert one.\n\nRegardless of chemical constraints, RP-1 has supply constraints, due to the very small size of the launch-vehicle industry versus other consumers of petroleum. While the material price of such a highly refined hydrocarbon is still less than many other rocket propellants, the number of RP-1 suppliers is limited.  A few engines{{Specify|date=April 2016}} have attempted to use more standard, wide-distribution petroleum products such as jet fuel or even diesel. By using alternate or supplemental engine cooling methods, some can tolerate the non-optimal formulations.\n\nAny hydrocarbon-based fuel when burned produces more air pollution than hydrogen.

RP-1 has a lower [[specific impulse]] than [[liquid hydrogen]] (LH<sub>2</sub>), but is cheaper, stable at room temperature, far less of an explosion hazard, and far denser. RP-1 is significantly more powerful than LH<sub>2</sub> by volume. RP-1 also has a fraction of the [[toxicity]] and [[carcinogen]]ic hazards of [[hydrazine]], another room-temperature liquid fuel.  \n[[File:RP-1 .jpg| thumb |About 2 L of RP-1]]\n\n==Usage and history==\n\nRP-1 is most commonly burned with LOX ([[liquid oxygen]]) as the oxidizer, though other oxidizers have also been used. RP-1 is a fuel in the first-stage boosters of the [[Soyuz-FG]], [[Zenit (rocket family)|Zenit]], [[Delta rocket|Delta I-III]], [[Atlas (rocket)|Atlas]], [[Falcon 9]], [[Antares rocket|Antares]], and [[Tronador (rocket)|Tronador II]] rockets. It also powered the first stages of the [[Energia]], [[Titan I]], [[Saturn I (rocket)|Saturn I and IB]], and [[Saturn V]]. The [[ISRO|Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO)]] is also developing an RP-1 fueled engine for its future rockets.<ref>[http://www.isro.org/sites/default/files/AnnualReports/2014/STS.html Semi-cryogenic Project] ISRO Annual Report 2013 - 2014</ref>\n\nDuring and immediately after World War II, [[alcohol]]s (primarily [[ethanol]], occasionally [[methanol]]) were the most common fuels for large [[Liquid-fuel rocket|liquid-fueled rockets]].  Their high [[heat of vaporization]] kept [[Regenerative cooling (rocket)|regeneratively-cooled]] engines from melting, especially considering that alcohols would typically contain several percent water.  However, it was recognized that [[hydrocarbon]] fuels would increase engine efficiency, due to a slightly higher density, the lack of an [[oxygen]] atom in the fuel molecule, and negligible water content.  Whatever hydrocarbon was chosen, though, would have to replicate alcohol's coolant ability.\n\nMany early rockets burned kerosene, but as burn times, combustion efficiencies, and combustion-chamber pressures increased, engine masses decreased, which led to unmanageable engine temperatures.  Raw kerosene used as coolant tends to [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociate]] and [[Polymerization|polymerize]].  Lightweight products in the form of gas bubbles cause cavitation, and heavy ones in the form of wax deposits block narrow cooling passages in the engine.  The resulting coolant starvation raises temperatures further, and causes more polymerization which accelerates breakdown. The cycle rapidly escalates (i.e. [[thermal runaway]]) until an engine wall rupture or other mechanical failure occurs, and it persists even when the entire coolant flow consists of kerosene. In the mid-1950s rocket designers turned to the chemical engineers to formulate a heat-resistant hydrocarbon, with the result being RP-1.\n\n==Fractions and formulation==\n\nFirst, [[sulfur]] compounds were [[Hydrodesulfurization|severely restricted]].  Small amounts of sulfur are naturally present in fossil fuels.  It was known that sulfur and sulfur compounds attack metals at high temperatures.  In addition, even small amounts of sulfur [[Vulcanization|assist polymerization]].\n\n[[Alkenes]] and [[aromatics]] were held to very low levels.  These unsaturated hydrocarbons tend to polymerize not only at temperature, but during long periods of storage.  At the time, it was thought that kerosene-fueled missiles might remain in storage for years awaiting activation.  This function was later transferred to [[solid-fuel rocket]]s, though the high-temperature benefits of saturated hydrocarbons remained.  Because of the low alkenes and aromatics, RP-1 is less toxic than various jet and diesel fuels, and far less toxic than [[gasoline]].\n\nThe more desirable [[isomer]]s were selected or synthesized.  [[Linear alkane]]s were removed in favor of highly branched and cyclic molecules.  This increased resistance to thermal breakdown, much as these isomer types improve [[octane rating]] in piston engines.  Jet engines and heating and lighting applications, the prior users of kerosene, had been much less concerned with thermal breakdown and isomer contents.  The most desirable isomers were polycyclics, loosely resembling [[ladderane]]s.\n\nIn production, these grades were processed tightly to remove impurities and side fractions. Ashes were feared likely to block fuel lines and engine passages, as well as wear away valves and [[turbopump]] bearings lubricated by the fuel. Slightly too-heavy or too-light fractions affected lubrication abilities and were likely to separate during storage and under load.  The remaining hydrocarbons are at or near C<sub>12</sub> mass.  Because of the lack of light hydrocarbons, RP-1 has a high [[flash point]] and is less of a fire hazard than [[gasoline]]/[[petrol]] or even some jet and diesel fuels.\n\nAll told, the final product is more expensive than straight-run kerosene.  On paper, any petroleum can produce some RP-1 with enough processing.  In practice, the fuel is sourced from a small number of oil fields with high-quality base stock.  This, coupled with small demand in a niche market compared to other petroleum users, drives the price.\nMilitary specifications of RP-1 are covered in MIL-R-25576,<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |url=http://www.braeunig.us/space/propel.htm |title=Basics of Space Flight: Rocket Propellants |publisher=Braeunig.us |date= |accessdate=2012-12-11}}</ref> and the chemical and physical properties of RP-1 are described in NISTIR 6646.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/IR/nistir6646.pdf | title=Thermophysical Properties Measurements and Models for Rocket Propellant RP-1: Phase I (NISTIR 6646)}}</ref>\n\nSoviet and Russian rocket-grade kerosenes are very similar to RP-1 and are designated T-1 and RG-1. Densities are higher, 0.82 to 0.85&nbsp;[[gram per litre|g/ml]], compared to RP-1 at 0.81&nbsp;g/ml.  For a short period, the Soviets achieved even higher densities by super-chilling the kerosene in a rocket\u2019s fuel tanks, but this partially defeated the purpose of using kerosene over other super-chilled fuels.  In the case of the [[Soyuz (rocket family)|Soyuz]] and other [[R-7 Semyorka|R7]]-based rockets, the temperature penalty was minor.  Facilities were already in place to manage the vehicle's cryogenic [[liquid oxygen]] and [[liquid nitrogen]], both of which are far colder than the kerosene temperature.  The launcher's central kerosene tank is surrounded on four sides and the top by liquid-oxygen tanks; the liquid-nitrogen tank is nearby at the bottom.  The kerosene tanks of the four boosters are relatively small and compact, and also between a liquid-oxygen and a liquid-nitrogen tank.  Thus, once the kerosene was chilled initially, it could remain so for the brief time needed to finish launch preparations. The latest version of Falcon 9, [[Falcon 9 Full Thrust]], also has the capability of sub-cooling the RP-1 fuel to \u22127&nbsp;\u00b0C, giving a 2.5\u20134% density increase.\n\n==Comparison with other fuels==\nChemically, a hydrocarbon propellant is less efficient than hydrogen fuel because hydrogen releases more energy per unit mass during combustion, enabling a higher exhaust velocity. This is, in part, a result of the high mass of carbon atoms relative to hydrogen atoms.  Hydrocarbon engines are also typically run fuel-rich, which produces some [[Carbon monoxide|CO]] instead of CO<sub>2</sub> as a consequence of incomplete combustion, although this is not unique to hydrocarbon engines, as hydrogen engines are also typically run fuel-rich for the best overall performance. Some Russian engines run their turbopump preburners oxygen-rich, but the main combustion chamber is still run fuel-rich. All told, kerosene engines generate a [[Specific impulse|''I''<sub>sp</sub>]] in the range of 270 to 360&nbsp;seconds, while hydrogen engines achieve 370 to 465&nbsp;seconds.\n\nDuring engine shutdown, fuel flow goes to zero rapidly, while the engine is still quite hot.  Residual and trapped fuel can polymerize or even [[Carbonization|carbonize]] at hot spots or in hot components.  Even without hot spots, heavy fuels can create a petroleum residue, as can be seen in gasoline, diesel, or jet fuel tanks that have been in service for years. Rocket engines have cycle lifetimes measured in minutes or even seconds, preventing truly heavy deposits.  However, rockets are much more sensitive to a deposit, as described above. Thus, kerosene systems generally entail more teardowns and overhauls, creating operations and labor expenses.  This is a problem for expendable engines, as well as reusable ones, because engines must be ground-fired some number of times before launch.  Even cold-flow tests, in which the propellants are not ignited, can leave residues.\n\nOn the upside, below a chamber pressure of about 1000&nbsp;psi (6.9&nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|MPa]]), kerosene can produce sooty deposits on the inside of the nozzle and chamber liner. This acts as a significant insulation layer and can reduce the heat flow into the wall by roughly a factor of two. Most modern hydrocarbon engines, however, run above this pressure, therefore this is not a significant effect for most engines.\n\nRecent heavy-hydrocarbon engines have modified components and new operating cycles, in attempts to better manage leftover fuel, achieve a more-gradual cooldown, or both.  This still leaves the problem of non-dissociated petroleum residue.  Other new engines have tried to bypass the problem entirely, by switching to light hydrocarbons such as [[methane]] or [[propane]] gas.  Both are volatiles, so engine residues simply evaporate.  If necessary, solvents or other purgatives can be run through the engine to finish dispersion.  The short-chain carbon backbone of propane (a C<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;molecule) is very difficult to break; methane, with a single carbon atom (C<sub>1</sub>), is technically not a chain at all.  The breakdown products of both molecules are also gases, with fewer problems due to phase separation, and much less likelihood of polymerization and deposition.  However, methane (and to a lesser extent propane) reintroduces handling inconveniences that prompted kerosenes in the first place.\n\nThe low [[vapor pressure]] of kerosenes gives safety for ground crews.  However, in flight the kerosene tank needs a separate pressurization system to replace fuel volume as it drains.  Generally, this is a separate tank of liquid or high-pressure inert gas, such as [[nitrogen]] or [[helium]].  This creates extra cost and weight.  [[Cryogenics|Cryogenic]] or volatile propellants generally do not need a separate pressurant; instead, some propellant is expanded (often with engine heat) into low-density gas and routed back to its tank.  A few highly volatile propellant designs do not even need the gas loop; some of the liquid automatically vaporizes to fill its own container.  Some rockets use gas from a [[gas generator]] to pressurize the fuel tank; usually, this is exhaust from a [[turbopump]].  Although this saves the weight of a separate gas system, the loop now has to handle a hot, reactive gas instead of a cool, inert one.\n\nRegardless of chemical constraints, RP-1 has supply constraints, due to the very small size of the launch-vehicle industry versus other consumers of petroleum. While the material price of such a highly refined hydrocarbon is still less than many other rocket propellants, the number of RP-1 suppliers is limited.  A few engines{{Specify|date=April 2016}} have attempted to use more standard, wide-distribution petroleum products such as jet fuel or even diesel. By using alternate or supplemental engine cooling methods, some can tolerate the non-optimal formulations.\n\nAny hydrocarbon-based fuel when burned produces more air pollution than hydrogen. Hydrocarbon combustion produces carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC) emissions, and oxides of nitrogen (NO<sub>''x''</sub>), while hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) reacts with oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) to produce only water (H<sub>2</sub>O), with some unreacted H<sub>2</sub> also released.\n\n==RP-1-like fuels==\n\n[[Robert H. Goddard]]'s initial rockets used gasoline.\n\nWhile the RP-1 specification was being developed, [[Rocketdyne]] was experimenting with [[diethyl cyclohexane]].
