It is located in '''[[Kalaw Township]]''' which is part of '''[[Taunggyi District]]'''. \nIt lies on the [[Thazi, Meiktila, Mandalay Region|Thazi]]-[[Kengtung|Kyaingtong]] road at an elevation of 4219 feet (1286 meters) above sea level. \n\nAs of September 2014, its population was recorded 30,313.\nIt is a junction town in the midst of agricultural villages and thus the majority of agricultural products (mainly potato, garlic, ginger, cabbage, tomato, cauliflower, avocado, orange, tea-leaves) from nearby towns and villages are all collected thereby traders and distributed to other parts of the country, especially to '''[[Yangon]]''', '''[[Mandalay]]''', '''[[Karen State]]''' and '''[[Mon State]]'''.\n\nThe single-line railway line was extended from [[Aungban|Aungpan]] to [[Shwenyaung]], in the 1920s  and [[Heho]], a small village of [[Danu people]] grew into a town. [[Heho]] was determined to be a convenient intermediate stop and transfer point.   Later an [[Heho Airport|airport]] was built, {{convert|4|km|abbr=on}} northwest of the town.  The [[airport]] served as an airbase both for the Allies and the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] during [[World War II]] and it was heavily bombed by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].  Evidence of aircraft bunker revetments and bomb craters can still be seen on the southern end of the airfield, especially noticeable from the air.\n\n== Overview ==\n \nAs a trade hub in the region, more than half a dozen banks are being operated. As a logistically important place, most of the biggest companies in the country set up branch offices there, creating many employment opportunities for local people. Job opportunities vary from porters and lorry-drivers to mid-level management officers.\n\nThe town also plays a strategic role in military works that it has become an army base. The Seven-hundred bedded military hospital started its operation in the 2000s, providing healthcare service not only to military personnel but also to the wider public.\n\nRecent Town Committee's permit to set '''Aungpan''''s '''[[Pindaya]]''' exit road as an entertainment zone let KTVs mushroom along the road, forming as an only red-light district in the region. \nPin-hmi golf range which is located near the southern exit of the town is getting popular among local golfers and always crowded on weekends. Special tournaments are often held by the club, which is commonly sponsored by '''[[Kanbawza Bank|KBZ Bank]]'''.\n\nThe '''Aungpan'''-'''[[Loikaw]]''' railroad was constructed in 1992. The condition of motorway from Aungpan to '''[[Loikaw]]''' was significantly improved over the past few years and local people no longer rely on train services nowadays.\n\nA recent boom in the tourism industry of '''[[Kalaw]]''' as a popular hiking spot and hill station has brought some impact to Aungpan as well. There are more than five hotels offering hundreds of rooms to visitors.\n\nDespite earning many municipal taxes from local businesses and people, township administrative parties were focusing mainly on '''[[Kalaw]]''' that the town grew double in size without proper city planning. There are no public amenities for the population and the private business sector starts to take chance by developing swimming pools, playground, football pitches, etc. around the town. \nThere is a small lake, named '''Mingalar Lake''' in '''Bahtoo Park'''. Once it was a collection of drain water discharged from living quarters. Renovation and restoration work for the park and the lake was carried out by the chairman of '''[[Kanbawza Bank|KBZ Bank]]''' and now it becomes a recreational place for the locals.\n\nThe motorway passing through '''Aungpan''' is upgraded to four-lane recently. Consequently, buildings fall under motorway's zoning undergone demolition. Captain Ba Htoo's (one of the most famous leaders during Burma's Independence Movement during the colonial period) Memorial Monument was destroyed and to be built back near the original place. Controversial and criticisms arose around the country for complete demolishment without considering for relocation. The construction of the Monument was completed and to be opened on March 27th, 2020. However, the opening ceremony was canceled due to the outbreak of '''Coronavirus disease 2019''' ('''COVID-19'''), an [[infectious disease]] caused by [[severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2]] in the country on March 23rd, 2020 reported by '''MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND SPORTS''' [https://www.mohs.gov.mm/]|.\nThe town's 100-years-anniversary clock-tower at the '''[[Pindaya]]''' junction was removed as well.\nUpgrade will be finished by April 2020 and now the town gets a newer look. \nHowever, the common use of motorway for the town's own traffic and speedy expressway vehicles is likely to lead accidents unless proper traffic regulation and enforcement are practiced.\n\n== Climate ==\nAungpan has a Dry-winter humid [[subtropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cwa'').\n''Cwa'' is monsoonal influenced, having the classic dry winter \u2013 wet summer pattern associated with tropical monsoonal climates.\nThe weather is usually warm and temperate. When compared with winter, the summers have much more rainfall. \nThe average annual temperature in [[Aungban|Aungpan]] is 19.1 \u00b0C (66.3 \u00b0F). \nThe warmest month of the year is April, with an average temperature of 22.7 \u00b0C (72.9 \u00b0F).

The aim is to \"expose students to their specialized crop and do more research in order to become crop specialists\". The undergraduate students come to '''Aungpan''' branch to study and do research on maize and cereals.\nThe Seven-hundred bed military hospital also serves as a teaching hospital for Defence Service Medical Academy's house surgeons from '''[[Yangon]]'''. Therefore, several students of various age-levels can be seen in the town.\n\n== Health care ==\n\n=== Public Hospitals ===\n* Aungpan General Hospital\n* 700-bed military Hospital\n* Gayunar Yike Nyein Clinic ({{my|\u1000\u101b\u102f\u100f\u102c\u101b\u102d\u1015\u103a\u1004\u103c\u102d\u1019\u103a\u1006\u1031\u1038\u1001\u1014\u103a\u1038}})\n\n==Aungchanthar Pagoda==\n[[File:Aung Chan Thar Pagoda1.jpg|thumb|right|Aung Chan Thar Pagoda under construction.

It was founded on July 20th, 2005 \u2013 the full moon day of [[Waso]], (1367 in the '''[[Myanmar]]''' calendar). Its name literally means \u201cVictory and Prosperity\u201d.\n\nLeading the project is U Pyinnya Wunsa (68 years old), the abbot of Aungchanthar monastery and a member of the State Sangha Maha Nayaka Committee, locally known as Aungchanthar Sayadaw. \n\n[[File: Aung Chan Thar Pagoda2.jpg|thumb|left|Aung Chan Thar Pagoda under construction. (February, 2020)]]\n \nThere is still a lot of work to do until the Pagoda is complete.\nHe decided to build the Pagoda because '''Aungpan''' is at the center of several famous places in the region, such as '''[[Inle Lake]]''' and '''[[Pindaya Caves|Pindaya]]''', and visitors frequently ask him why the town doesn't have any sacred pagoda. \n\nIt has been under construction for about fifteen years. It had been spent about [[Kyat]] six billion (about [[US$]] 6 million) on the pagoda and it's about two-third finished. In 2005, it was estimated to cost about [[Kyat]] 7.6 billion. \n\nThe project has been really quite slow in the past ten years but visitors to the region often want to donate after hearing about the project. Now the project is moving much faster.\n\n[[File:Interior structure of pagoda.jpg|thumb|left|The interior structure of pagoda. (February, 2020)]]\n\nWhen completed, the pagoda will be encircled by 107 smaller stupas, ranging in height from 6 feet (1.8 meters) to 12 feet (3.6 meters). \nWhile Aungchanthar Pagoda will replicate '''[[Shwedagon Pagoda]]''', it will also incorporate a hollow interior.\n\nLocals are very pleased that they would soon have a major religious site in their town and it would improve the town's image.\n\n==References==\n<ref>mmtimes.com/national-news/4539-aungban-builds-shwedagon-replica.html</ref>\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.maplandia.com/burma/shan/kalaw/aungban/ Satellite map at Maplandia.com]\n\n{{Kalaw Township}}\n{{Shan State}}\n\n[[Category:Populated places in Taunggyi District]]\n[[Category:Kalaw Township]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox settlement\n| native_name = {{my|\u1021\u1031\u102c\u1004\u103a\u1015\u1014\u103a\u1038\u1019\u103c\u102d\u102f\u1037}}\n| official_name = Aungpan\n|pushpin_map = Burma\n|pushpin_map_caption = Location in Burma\n|image_skyline = Aungban.jpg\n|image_map = \n|subdivision_type = Country\n|subdivision_name = {{Flag|Myanmar}}\n|subdivision_type1 = [[Administrative divisions of Burma|State]]\n|subdivision_name1 = {{flag|Shan State}}\n|subdivision_type2 = [[Districts of Burma|Districts]]\n|subdivision_name2 = [[Taunggyi District]]\n|subdivision_type3 = Township\n|subdivision_name3 = [[Kalaw Township]]\n|unit_pref = Imperial\n|area_total_km2 = \n|population = \n|population_as_of = 2014\n\n|population_blank1            = [[Shan people|Shan]], [[Danu people|Danu]], [[Bamar]], [[Pa-O]], [[Taungyo]], [[Burmese Chinese]], [[Burmese Indians]], [[Burmese Gurkha|Gurkha]]\n|population_blank1_title     = Ethnicities\n|population_blank2 = [[Theravada Buddhism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]]\n|population_blank2_title = Religions\n|population_density_km2 = auto\n|population_total = 30,313\n\n| map_caption                     = \n| pushpin_map                     = Myanmar#Asia\n| pushpin_label_position          = bottom\n| pushpin_map_caption             = Location of Aungpan, Myanmar\n| coordinates                     = {{coord|20|40|0|N|96|38|0|E|type:town_region:MM|display=inline,title}}\n\n\n|leader_title = Mayor\n|established_date = 1913\n|established_title = Founded\n|elevation_ft = 4219\n|elevation_m =  1286\n|timezone = [[Time in Burma|MST]]\n|utc_offset               = +6.30\n|area_code                = 081\n|postal_code_type         = [[Postal code]] [http://www.myanmaposts.net.mm/]\n|postal_code              = 06022\n|registration_plate       = SHN\n|website                  =\n}}\n\n'''Aungpan''' ({{lang-my|\u1021\u1031\u102c\u1004\u103a\u1015\u1014\u103a\u1038\u1019\u103c\u102d\u102f\u1037}}) is a town located in the '''Southern [[Shan State]].'''

The aim is to \"expose students to their specialized crop and do more research in order to become crop specialists\". The undergraduate students come to '''Aungpan''' branch to study and do research on maize and cereals.\nThe Seven-hundred bed military hospital also serves as a teaching hospital for Defence Service Medical Academy's house surgeons from '''[[Yangon]]'''. Therefore, several students of various age-levels can be seen in the town.\n\n== Health care ==\n\n=== Public Hospitals ===\n* Aungpan General Hospital\n* 700-bed military hospital\n\n==Aungchanthar Pagoda==\n[[File:Aung Chan Thar Pagoda1.jpg|thumb|right|Aung Chan Thar Pagoda under construction. (February, 2020)]]\n\nLocals in the town hope that an ongoing pagoda project of '''Aungchanthar Pagoda''' will change visitors\u2019 perceptions of their hometown and will become the landmark and symbol of the religion. \n'''Aungchanthar Pagoda''' is a 162-foot (48.5-meter) replica of '''[[Yangon]]''''s '''[[Shwedagon Pagoda]]'''. It was founded on July 20th, 2005 \u2013 the full moon day of [[Waso]], (1367 in the '''[[Myanmar]]''' calendar). Its name literally means \u201cVictory and Prosperity\u201d.\n\nLeading the project is U Pyinnya Wunsa (68 years old), the abbot of Aungchanthar monastery and a member of the State Sangha Maha Nayaka Committee, locally known as Aungchanthar Sayadaw. \n\n[[File: Aung Chan Thar Pagoda2.jpg|thumb|left|Aung Chan Thar Pagoda under construction. (February, 2020)]]\n \nThere is still a lot of work to do until the Pagoda is complete.\nHe decided to build the Pagoda because '''Aungpan''' is at the center of several famous places in the region, such as '''[[Inle Lake]]''' and '''[[Pindaya Caves|Pindaya]]''', and visitors frequently ask him why the town doesn't have any sacred pagoda. \n\nIt has been under construction for about fifteen years. It had been spent about [[Kyat]] six billion (about [[US$]] 6 million) on the pagoda and it's about two-third finished. In 2005, it was estimated to cost about [[Kyat]] 7.6 billion. \n\nThe project has been really quite slow in the past ten years but visitors to the region often want to donate after hearing about the project. Now the project is moving much faster.\n\n[[File:Interior structure of pagoda.jpg|thumb|left|The interior structure of pagoda. (February, 2020)]]\n\nWhen completed, the pagoda will be encircled by 107 smaller stupas, ranging in height from 6 feet (1.8 meters) to 12 feet (3.6 meters). \nWhile Aungchanthar Pagoda will replicate '''[[Shwedagon Pagoda]]''', it will also incorporate a hollow interior.\n\nLocals are very pleased that they would soon have a major religious site in their town and it would improve the town's image.\n\n==References==\n<ref>mmtimes.com/national-news/4539-aungban-builds-shwedagon-replica.html</ref>\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.maplandia.com/burma/shan/kalaw/aungban/ Satellite map at Maplandia.com]\n\n{{Kalaw Township}}\n{{Shan State}}\n\n[[Category:Populated places in Taunggyi District]]\n[[Category:Kalaw Township]]\n", "name_user": "Kmthu.ytu", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aungban"}

In the 1862 the Dutch East Indies government decided to build a new museum that would not only serve as an office but also could be used to house, preserve and display the collections.\n\n[[File:Gedung Gajah Museum Nasional.jpg|right|thumb|Gedung Gajah, the old wing of National Museum.]]\n\nThe Museum was officially opened in 1868 and popularly known as ''Gedung Gajah'' (Elephant Building) or sometimes called ''Gedung Arca'' (The house of Statues). It was called ''Gedung Gajah'' on account of the bronze elephant statue in the front yard \u2013 a gift to Batavia from King [[Chulalongkorn]] of Siam in 1871. It was also called ''Gedung Arca'' because a great variety of statues from different periods are on display in the house.\n\n[[File:Museum Nasional Courtyard.jpg|right|thumb|The [[peristyle]] (inner courtyard) of the National Museum, features [[Doric order]] Greek architecture.]]\n\nThe museum acquired its collection through many ways, among others were through scientific expeditions, excavations of archaeological sites, acquisition of private collections, gifts from distinguished patrons, objects donated by religious missions; such as ethnological artifacts acquired by Christian ''Zending'' and Catholic [[Missionary|Missions]], and also treasures acquired \u2014 or looted to be exact \u2014 from a numbers of Dutch East Indies military campaigns against indigenous kingdoms and polities in the archipelago.

Unfortunately, a fire in the exhibition hall demolished the Dutch East Indies' exhibition pavilion and destroyed most of the objects. The museum received some insurance money as compensation and the following year these funds were used to build the old ceramics room, the bronze room, and both treasure rooms on the second floor.\n\nIn February, 1950 the institution became the ''Lembaga Kebudayaan Indonesia'' (Indonesian Culture Council). On September 17, 1962 it was handed over to the Indonesian government and became known as ''Museum Pusat'' (Central Museum). By decree of the Minister of Education and Culture No. 092/0/1979 May 28, 1979 it was renamed the Museum Nasional.\n\nIn 1977, an agreement between Indonesia and the Netherlands accede to return some of cultural treasures back to Indonesia. The prized treasures among others are the treasures of Lombok, the [[Nagarakretagama]] [[lontar]] manuscript, and the exquisite [[Prajnaparamita of Java]] statue.\nThese treasures were sent back from the Netherlands and now being kept in the National Museum of Indonesia.<ref name=\"Potret-MNI\">{{rp|15}}\n\nIn 2007, a new building to the north side of existing building was opened, featuring many artifacts from prehistoric times to modern times.

In the 1862 the Dutch East Indies government decided to build a new museum that would not only serve as an office but also could be used to house, preserve and display the collections.\n\n[[File:Gedung Gajah Museum Nasional.jpg|right|thumb|Gedung Gajah, the old wing of National Museum.]]\n\nThe Museum was officially opened in 1868 and popularly known as ''Gedung Gajah'' (Elephant Building) or sometimes called ''Gedung Arca'' (The house of Statues). It was called ''Gedung Gajah'' on account of the bronze elephant statue in the front yard \u2013 a gift to Batavia from King [[Chulalongkorn]] of Siam in 1871. It was also called ''Gedung Arca'' because a great variety of statues from different periods are on display in the house.\n\n[[File:Museum Nasional Courtyard.jpg|right|thumb|The [[peristyle]] (inner courtyard) of the National Museum, features [[Doric order]] Greek architecture.]]\n\nThe museum acquired its collection through many ways, among others were through scientific expeditions, excavations of archaeological sites, acquisition of private collections, gifts from distinguished patrons, objects donated by religious missions; such as ethnological artifacts acquired by Christian ''Zending'' and Catholic [[Missionary|Missions]], and also treasures acquired \u2014 or looted to be exact \u2014 from a numbers of Dutch East Indies military campaigns against indigenous kingdoms and polities in the archipelago.

Unfortunately, a fire in the exhibition hall demolished the Dutch East Indies' exhibition pavilion and destroyed most of the objects. The museum received some insurance money as compensation and the following year these funds were used to build the old ceramics room, the bronze room, and both treasure rooms on the second floor.\n\nIn February, 1950 the institution became the ''Lembaga Kebudayaan Indonesia'' (Indonesian Culture Council). On September 17, 1962 it was handed over to the Indonesian government and became known as ''Museum Pusat'' (Central Museum). By decree of the Minister of Education and Culture No. 092/0/1979 May 28, 1979 it was renamed the Museum Nasional.\n\nIn 1977, an agreement between Indonesia and the Netherlands accede to return some of cultural treasures back to Indonesia. The prized treasures among others are the treasures of Lombok, the [[Nagarakretagama]] [[lontar]] manuscript, and the exquisite [[Prajnaparamita of Java]] statue.\nThese treasures were sent back from the Netherlands and now being kept in the National Museum of Indonesia.<ref name=\"Potret-MNI\">{{rp|15}}\n\nIn 2007, a new building to the north side of existing building was opened, featuring many artifacts from prehistoric times to modern times. This new building, called ''Gedung Arca'' (Statue Building), provides a new exhibition wing. The old building is named as ''Gedung Gajah'' (Elephant Building).\n\nIn September 11, 2013, four precious golden artifacts from the 10th-century [[Medang Kingdom|Eastern Medang kingdom]] period was stolen from the museum. The items were first discovered in the ruins of the Jalatunda ancient royal bathing place and in the temples on the slopes of [[Mount Penanggungan]] in [[Mojokerto Regency]], East Java. The four missing artifacts were a dragon-shaped gold plaque, a scripted crescent-shaped gold plaque and one golden-silver Harihara plaque, as well as a small golden box.

Popularly named as ''gedung gajah'' (Indonesian for elephant building) to refer the bronze elephant statue in front of the building, which was the gift of Siamese King [[Chulalongkorn]]. The museum collections are grouped and arranged by subjects:\n\n===Stone Sculpture Collection (Hindu-Buddhist Art of Ancient Indonesia)===\nThe National Museum of Indonesia has the richest and the largest collection of Hindu-Buddhist art of ancient Indonesia. The Hindu-Buddhist sculptures, relics and inscriptions was collected from Java, Bali, Sumatra, and Borneo, all are in display in the lobby, the central hall and the central atrium of the museum. The Buddha statues from [[Borobudur]] in various [[mudra]]s are displayed in the lobby. The centerpiece collection also the largest artifact of the museum is the statue of [[Adityawarman|Adityavarman]] depicted as [[Bhairava]]. This statue is more than 4 meters tall and discovered from Rambahan, Padangroco, West Sumatra. \n\nNotable collections including the well-preserved 9th-century statues of Hindu deities taken from Banon Temple, which consists of Ganesha, Vishnu, Shiva and Agastya. Several statues of [[Durga|Durga Mahisasuramardini]] discovered in Java, the [[Tarumanagara]]n Vishnu statue of Cibuaya, the Srivijayan Avalokiteshvara statue of Bingin Jungut, the Avalokiteshvara head of Aceh, the head statues from Bima temple of [[Dieng temples|Dieng]]. The statue of Harihara, dated from Majapahit period taken from Simping temple, and the statue of Parvati taken from Rimbi temple are among important Majapahit relics. Numbers of inscriptions are also stored and displayed in this section, including [[Telaga Batu inscription|Telaga Batu]], [[Amoghapasa inscription|Amoghapasa]] and [[Anjuk Ladang inscription]].\n\n===Treasure Rooms (Archaeology and Ethnography Collection)===\n[[File:Prajnaparamita Java Front.JPG|right|thumb|[[Prajnaparamita]], the Buddhist goddess of transcendental wisdom is the masterpiece of ancient Java art, displayed in treasure room.]]\nThe Second floor of the museum is feature treasures, gold, and precious artifact and arranged in two rooms; archaeological treasure and ethnology treasure. Taking picture is prohibited in the treasure rooms.\n\nArchaeological treasure room features ancient gold and precious relics acquired from archaeological findings, mostly originated from ancient Java. One of the most prized collection of the museum is the statue of [[Prajnaparamita of Java|Prajnaparamita]]. Dubbed as the most beautiful sculpture of ancient Java, the goddess of transcendental wisdom is displayed in the entrance of archaeology treasure room to shows about how gold jewelries and precious ornaments were worn on the body. Such ancient gold adornments were in display; such as crown, ear adornment, earrings, rings, bracelets, ''kelat bahu'' (arm bracelet), leg bracelet, waist band, belt, ''upawita'' or ''tali kasta'' (golden chain worn across the chest), and other precious artifacts of ancient Java, such as the famous [[Wonoboyo hoard]]. Wonoboyo hoard is the treasures originated from 9th century Hindu [[Mataram Kingdom]] discovered in Wonoboyo, [[Klaten]], Central Java, near [[Prambanan]]. The treasures are golden bowl with scene of [[Ramayana]], purse, water dipper, umbrella finial, and spoon or ladle, all were made of gold. Also discovered ancient Java gold coins with shape similar to a corn seed. Golden Hindu-Buddhist relics were also in display, such as the Hindu gods images made from gold leaf, bronze statue of [[Shiva|Shiva Mahadeva]] with gold applied on his lips and third eye, the bronze statue of [[Avalokiteshvara]] and also the silver statue of youthful [[Manjusri]].\n[[File:Golden Cup of Bali.JPG|thumb|left|Dulang golden cup of [[Klungkung Palace|Puri Klungkung]], Bali]]\nThe ethnology treasure room features treasures acquired from royal houses of Indonesia, such as regalias from various ''[[istana]]s'', ''[[Kraton (Indonesia)|kraton]]s'' and ''puri'' of Indonesian archipelago. Most of these ''pusaka'' royal regalias and treasures, were acquired or looted, during Dutch East Indies military campaigns against the archipelago's regional kingdoms, that took place between the 19th to early 20th century; including the royal houses of Banten, Banjarmasin, Bali and Lombok.\n\nThe royal regalia and treasures are arranged in several island zones: Sumatra, Java, Bali, Borneo, Sulawesi, and Eastern Indonesia (Nusa Tenggara, Maluku and Papua). The ethnology treasure room display various royal precious objects such as golden jewelries, ceremonial containers and weapons. The jewelries are bracelets and rings embedded with rubies, diamond, precious and semi precious stones. The collections are gilded Balinese [[kris]] weapon embedded with precious and semi precious stones and various spear heads. Golden royal crowns, gilded throne, golden royal regalia, golden tobacco container, golden cup, ''Pekinangan'' (silver betel-nut set), sword and golden shield is among the collection of the treasure room.\n\n===Ceramics collection===\n[[File:Majapahit, Piggy Bank.jpg|right|thumb|a [[Majapahit]] [[piggy bank]] from [[Trowulan]], [[East Java]].]]\nThe collection of ceramics room is ranged from prehistoric [[Buni culture]], [[Majapahit]] [[terracota]], to the ceramics of China, Japan, Vietnam, Thailand, and [[Myanmar]]. Majapahit terracota water vessels, statues, roof tiles to [[piggy bank]] are on display. The museum houses a large and complete collection of ancient [[Chinese ceramics]]. It has one of the best and the most complete collections of Chinese ceramics discovered outside China.

Feature extraction creates new features from functions of the original features, whereas feature selection returns a subset of the features. Feature selection techniques are often used in domains where there are many features and comparatively few samples (or data points). Archetypal cases for the application of feature selection include the analysis of [[Stylometry|written texts]] and [[DNA microarray]] data, where there are many thousands of features, and a few tens to hundreds of samples.\n\n==Introduction==\nA feature selection algorithm can be seen as the combination of a search technique for proposing new feature subsets, along with an evaluation measure which scores the different feature subsets. The simplest algorithm is to test each possible subset of features finding the one which minimizes the error rate. This is an exhaustive search of the space, and is computationally intractable for all but the smallest of feature sets. The choice of evaluation metric heavily influences the algorithm, and it is these evaluation metrics which distinguish between the three main categories of feature selection algorithms: wrappers, filters and embedded methods.<ref name=\"guyon-intro\">{{cite journal |title=An Introduction to Variable and Feature Selection |first1=Isabelle |last1=Guyon |first2=Andr\u00e9 |last2=Elisseeff |journal=[[Journal of Machine Learning Research|JMLR]] |volume=3 |year=2003 |url=http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/v3/guyon03a.html}}</ref>\n\n* Wrapper methods use a predictive model to score feature subsets. Each new subset is used to train a model, which is tested on a hold-out set. Counting the number of mistakes made on that hold-out set (the error rate of the model) gives the score for that subset. As wrapper methods train a new model for each subset, they are very computationally intensive, but usually provide the best performing feature set for that particular type of model or typical problem.\n* Filter methods use a proxy measure instead of the error rate to score a feature subset. This measure is chosen to be fast to compute, while still capturing the usefulness of the feature set.

However the feature set doesn't contain the assumptions of a prediction model, and so is more useful for exposing the relationships between the features. Many filters provide a feature ranking rather than an explicit best feature subset, and the cut off point in the ranking is chosen via [[Cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]]. Filter methods have also been used as a preprocessing step for wrapper methods, allowing a wrapper to be used on larger problems. One other popular approach is the Recursive Feature Elimination algorithm,<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Guyon I.|author2=Weston J.|author3=Barnhill S.|author4=Vapnik V.|title=Gene selection for cancer classification using support vector machines|journal=Machine Learning|date=2002|volume=46|issue=1\u20133|pages=389\u2013422|doi=10.1023/A:1012487302797}}</ref> commonly used with [[Support Vector Machines]] to repeatedly construct a model and remove features with low weights. \n* Embedded methods are a catch-all group of techniques which perform feature selection as part of the model construction process. The exemplar of this approach is the [[Lasso (statistics)|LASSO]] method for constructing a linear model, which penalizes the regression coefficients with an L1 penalty, shrinking many of them to zero. Any features which have non-zero regression coefficients are 'selected' by the LASSO algorithm. Improvements to the LASSO include Bolasso which bootstraps samples;<ref name=Bolasso>{{Cite book|last1=Bach|first1=Francis R|title=Bolasso: model consistent lasso estimation through the bootstrap|journal=Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Machine Learning|date=2008|pages=33\u201340|doi=10.1145/1390156.1390161|isbn=9781605582054}}</ref> [[Elastic net regularization]], which combines the L1 penalty of LASSO with the L2 penalty of [[ridge regression]]; and FeaLect which scores all the features based on combinatorial analysis of regression coefficients.<ref name=FeaLect>{{cite journal|last1=Zare|first1=Habil|title=Scoring relevancy of features based on combinatorial analysis of Lasso with application to lymphoma diagnosis|journal=BMC Genomics|date=2013|volume=14|pages=S14|doi=10.1186/1471-2164-14-S1-S14|pmid=23369194|pmc=3549810}}</ref> AEFS further extends LASSO to nonlinear scenario with autoencoders.<ref>{{cite conference |author1=Kai Han|author2=Yunhe Wang|author3=Chao Zhang|author4=Chao Li|author5=Chao Xu|title=Autoencoder inspired unsupervised feature selection |conference=IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP) |year=2018}}</ref> These approaches tend to be between filters and wrappers in terms of computational complexity.\n\nIn traditional [[regression analysis]], the most popular form of feature selection is [[stepwise regression]], which is a wrapper technique.  It is a [[greedy algorithm]] that adds the best feature (or deletes the worst feature) at each round.  The main control issue is deciding when to stop the algorithm.  In machine learning, this is typically done by [[Cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]].  In statistics, some criteria are optimized.  This leads to the inherent problem of nesting. More robust methods have been explored, such as [[branch and bound]] and piecewise linear network.\n\n==Subset selection==\nSubset selection evaluates a subset of features as a group for suitability. Subset selection algorithms can be broken up into wrappers, filters, and embedded methods. Wrappers use a [[search algorithm]] to search through the space of possible features and evaluate each subset by running a model on the subset. Wrappers can be computationally expensive and have a risk of over fitting to the model. Filters are similar to wrappers in the search approach, but instead of evaluating against a model, a simpler filter is evaluated. Embedded techniques are embedded in, and specific to, a model.\n\nMany popular search approaches use [[greedy algorithm|greedy]] [[hill climbing]], which iteratively evaluates a candidate subset of features, then modifies the subset and evaluates if the new subset is an improvement over the old. Evaluation of the subsets requires a scoring [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] that grades a subset of features.  Exhaustive search is generally impractical, so at some implementor (or operator) defined stopping point, the subset of features with the highest score discovered up to that point is selected as the satisfactory feature subset.  The stopping criterion varies by algorithm; possible criteria include: a subset score exceeds a threshold, a program's maximum allowed run time has been surpassed, etc.\n\nAlternative search-based techniques are based on [[targeted projection pursuit]] which finds low-dimensional projections of the data that score highly: the features that have the largest projections in the lower-dimensional space are then selected.\n\nSearch approaches include:\n\n* Exhaustive\n* [[Best-first search|Best first]]\n* [[Simulated annealing]]\n* [[Genetic algorithm]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Soufan|first=Othman|last2=Kleftogiannis|first2=Dimitrios|last3=Kalnis|first3=Panos|last4=Bajic|first4=Vladimir B.|date=2015-02-26|title=DWFS: A Wrapper Feature Selection Tool Based on a Parallel Genetic Algorithm|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=10|issue=2|pages=e0117988|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0117988|pmid=25719748|pmc=4342225|issn=1932-6203|bibcode=2015PLoSO..1017988S}}</ref>\n* [[Greedy algorithm|Greedy]] forward selection<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Figueroa|first1=Alejandro|title=Exploring effective features for recognizing the user intent behind web queries|journal=Computers in Industry|date=2015|volume=68|pages=162\u2013169|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271911317|doi=10.1016/j.compind.2015.01.005}}</ref><ref>{{cite conference |last=Figueroa|first=Alejandro |author2=Guenter Neumann  |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259174469  |title=Learning to Rank Effective Paraphrases from Query Logs for Community Question Answering |conference= AAAI |year=2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Figueroa|first=Alejandro |author2=Guenter Neumann|title=Category-specific models for ranking effective paraphrases in community Question Answering|journal=Expert Systems with Applications|date=2014|volume=41|issue=10 |pages=4730\u20134742|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260519271|doi=10.1016/j.eswa.2014.02.004}}</ref>\n* Greedy backward elimination\n* [[Particle swarm optimization]]<ref name=\"sciencedirect.com\">{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=Y.|last2=Wang|first2=S.|last3=Phillips|first3=P.|title=Binary PSO with Mutation Operator for Feature Selection using Decision Tree applied to Spam Detection|journal=Knowledge-Based Systems|date=2014|volume=64|pages=22\u201331|doi=10.1016/j.knosys.2014.03.015}}</ref>\n* [[Targeted projection pursuit]]\n* Scatter Search<ref>F.C.

The aim is to penalise a feature's relevancy by its redundancy in the presence of the other selected features. The relevance of a feature set {{mvar|S}} for the class {{mvar|c}} is defined by the average value of all mutual information values between the individual feature {{math|''f<sub>i</sub>''}} and the class {{mvar|c}} as follows:\n\n:<math> D(S,c) = \\frac{1}{|S|}\\sum_{f_{i}\\in S}I(f_{i};c) </math>.\n\nThe redundancy of all features in the set {{mvar|S}} is the average value of all mutual information values between the feature {{math|''f<sub>i</sub>''}} and the feature {{math|''f<sub>j</sub>''}}:\n\n:<math> R(S) = \\frac{1}{|S|^{2}}\\sum_{f_{i},f_{j}\\in S}I(f_{i};f_{j})</math>\n\nThe mRMR criterion is a combination of two measures given above and is defined as follows:\n\n:<math>\\mathrm{mRMR}= \\max_{S}\n\\left[\\frac{1}{|S|}\\sum_{f_{i}\\in S}I(f_{i};c) - \n\\frac{1}{|S|^{2}}\\sum_{f_{i},f_{j}\\in S}I(f_{i};f_{j})\\right].</math>\n\nSuppose that there are {{mvar|n}} full-set features. Let {{math|''x<sub>i</sub>''}} be the set membership [[indicator function]] for feature {{math|''f<sub>i</sub>''}}, so that {{math|1=''x<sub>i</sub>''=1}} indicates presence and {{math|1=''x<sub>i</sub>''=0}} indicates absence of the feature {{math|''f<sub>i</sub>''}} in the globally optimal feature set. Let <math>c_i=I(f_i;c)</math> and <math>a_{ij}=I(f_i;f_j)</math>.

As mRMR approximates the combinatorial estimation problem with a series of much smaller problems, each of which only involves two variables, it thus uses pairwise joint probabilities which are more robust. In certain situations the algorithm may underestimate the usefulness of features as it has no way to measure interactions between features which can increase relevancy. This can lead to poor performance<ref name=\"Brown\" /> when the features are individually useless, but are useful when combined (a pathological case is found when the class is a [[parity function]] of the features). Overall the algorithm is more efficient (in terms of the amount of data required) than the theoretically optimal max-dependency selection, yet produces a feature set with little pairwise redundancy.\n\nmRMR is an instance of a large class of filter methods which trade off between relevancy and redundancy in different ways.<ref name=\"Brown\"/><ref name=\"docs.google\">Nguyen, H., Franke, K., Petrovic, S.

A recent method called regularized tree<ref name=\"DengRunger2012\">H. Deng, G. Runger, \"[https://sites.google.com/site/houtaodeng/publications/FSRegularizedTrees.pdf?attredirects=0 Feature Selection via Regularized Trees]\", Proceedings of the 2012 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN), IEEE, 2012</ref> can be used for feature subset selection. Regularized trees penalize using a variable similar to the variables selected at previous tree nodes for splitting the current node. Regularized trees only need build one tree model (or one tree ensemble model) and thus are computationally efficient.\n\nRegularized trees naturally handle numerical and categorical features, interactions and nonlinearities. They are invariant to attribute scales (units) and insensitive to [[outlier]]s, and thus, require little data preprocessing such as [[Normalization (statistics)|normalization]]. Regularized random forest (RRF)<ref name=\"RRF\">[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RRF/index.html RRF: Regularized Random Forest], [[R (programming language)|R]] package on [[CRAN (R programming language)|CRAN]]</ref> is one type of regularized trees. The guided RRF is an enhanced RRF which is guided by the importance scores from an ordinary random forest.\n\n==Overview on metaheuristics methods==\nA [[metaheuristic]] is a general description of an algorithm dedicated to solve difficult (typically [[NP-hardness|NP-hard]] problem) optimization problems for which there is no classical solving methods. Generally, a metaheuristic is a stochastic algorithm tending to reach a global optimum. There are many metaheuristics, from a simple local search to a complex global search algorithm.\n\n===Main principles===\nThe feature selection methods are typically presented in three classes based on how they combine the selection algorithm and the model building.\n\n====Filter method====\n[[File:Filter Methode.png|thumb|300px|Filter Method for feature selection]]\nFilter type methods select variables regardless of the model. They are based only on general features like the correlation with the variable to predict. Filter methods suppress the least interesting variables. The other variables will be part of a classification or a regression model used to classify or to predict data. These methods are particularly effective in computation time and robust to overfitting.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite thesis |first=Julie |last=Hamon |title=Optimisation combinatoire pour la s\u00e9lection de variables en r\u00e9gression en grande dimension : Application en g\u00e9n\u00e9tique animale |url=https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-00920205 |date=November 2013 |publisher=[[Lille University of Science and Technology]] |language=fr }}</ref>\n\nFilter methods tend to select redundant variables when they do not consider the relationships between variables.

Feature extraction creates new features from functions of the original features, whereas feature selection returns a subset of the features. Feature selection techniques are often used in domains where there are many features and comparatively few samples (or data points). Archetypal cases for the application of feature selection include the analysis of [[Stylometry|written texts]] and [[DNA microarray]] data, where there are many thousands of features, and a few tens to hundreds of samples.\n\n==Introduction==\nA feature selection algorithm can be seen as the combination of a search technique for proposing new feature subsets, along with an evaluation measure which scores the different feature subsets. The simplest algorithm is to test each possible subset of features finding the one which minimizes the error rate. This is an exhaustive search of the space, and is computationally intractable for all but the smallest of feature sets. The choice of evaluation metric heavily influences the algorithm, and it is these evaluation metrics which distinguish between the three main categories of feature selection algorithms: wrappers, filters and embedded methods.<ref name=\"guyon-intro\">{{cite journal |title=An Introduction to Variable and Feature Selection |first1=Isabelle |last1=Guyon |first2=Andr\u00e9 |last2=Elisseeff |journal=[[Journal of Machine Learning Research|JMLR]] |volume=3 |year=2003 |url=http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/v3/guyon03a.html}}</ref>\n\n* Wrapper methods use a predictive model to score feature subsets. Each new subset is used to train a model, which is tested on a hold-out set. Counting the number of mistakes made on that hold-out set (the error rate of the model) gives the score for that subset. As wrapper methods train a new model for each subset, they are very computationally intensive, but usually provide the best performing feature set for that particular type of model or typical problem.\n* Filter methods use a proxy measure instead of the error rate to score a feature subset. This measure is chosen to be fast to compute, while still capturing the usefulness of the feature set.

However the feature set doesn't contain the assumptions of a prediction model, and so is more useful for exposing the relationships between the features. Many filters provide a feature ranking rather than an explicit best feature subset, and the cut off point in the ranking is chosen via [[Cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]]. Filter methods have also been used as a preprocessing step for wrapper methods, allowing a wrapper to be used on larger problems. One other popular approach is the Recursive Feature Elimination algorithm,<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Guyon I.|author2=Weston J.|author3=Barnhill S.|author4=Vapnik V.|title=Gene selection for cancer classification using support vector machines|journal=Machine Learning|date=2002|volume=46|issue=1\u20133|pages=389\u2013422|doi=10.1023/A:1012487302797}}</ref> commonly used with [[Support Vector Machines]] to repeatedly construct a model and remove features with low weights. \n* Embedded methods are a catch-all group of techniques which perform feature selection as part of the model construction process. The exemplar of this approach is the [[Lasso (statistics)|LASSO]] method for constructing a linear model, which penalizes the regression coefficients with an L1 penalty, shrinking many of them to zero. Any features which have non-zero regression coefficients are 'selected' by the LASSO algorithm. Improvements to the LASSO include Bolasso which bootstraps samples;<ref name=Bolasso>{{Cite book|last1=Bach|first1=Francis R|title=Bolasso: model consistent lasso estimation through the bootstrap|journal=Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Machine Learning|date=2008|pages=33\u201340|doi=10.1145/1390156.1390161|isbn=9781605582054}}</ref> [[Elastic net regularization]], which combines the L1 penalty of LASSO with the L2 penalty of [[ridge regression]]; and FeaLect which scores all the features based on combinatorial analysis of regression coefficients.<ref name=FeaLect>{{cite journal|last1=Zare|first1=Habil|title=Scoring relevancy of features based on combinatorial analysis of Lasso with application to lymphoma diagnosis|journal=BMC Genomics|date=2013|volume=14|pages=S14|doi=10.1186/1471-2164-14-S1-S14|pmid=23369194|pmc=3549810}}</ref> AEFS further extends LASSO to nonlinear scenario with autoencoders.<ref>{{cite conference |author1=Kai Han|author2=Yunhe Wang|author3=Chao Zhang|author4=Chao Li|author5=Chao Xu|title=Autoencoder inspired unsupervised feature selection |conference=IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP) |year=2018}}</ref> These approaches tend to be between filters and wrappers in terms of computational complexity.\n\nIn traditional [[regression analysis]], the most popular form of feature selection is [[stepwise regression]], which is a wrapper technique.  It is a [[greedy algorithm]] that adds the best feature (or deletes the worst feature) at each round.  The main control issue is deciding when to stop the algorithm.  In machine learning, this is typically done by [[Cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]].  In statistics, some criteria are optimized.  This leads to the inherent problem of nesting. More robust methods have been explored, such as [[branch and bound]] and piecewise linear network.\n\n==Subset selection==\nSubset selection evaluates a subset of features as a group for suitability. Subset selection algorithms can be broken up into wrappers, filters, and embedded methods. Wrappers use a [[search algorithm]] to search through the space of possible features and evaluate each subset by running a model on the subset. Wrappers can be computationally expensive and have a risk of over fitting to the model. Filters are similar to wrappers in the search approach, but instead of evaluating against a model, a simpler filter is evaluated. Embedded techniques are embedded in, and specific to, a model.\n\nMany popular search approaches use [[greedy algorithm|greedy]] [[hill climbing]], which iteratively evaluates a candidate subset of features, then modifies the subset and evaluates if the new subset is an improvement over the old. Evaluation of the subsets requires a scoring [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] that grades a subset of features.  Exhaustive search is generally impractical, so at some implementor (or operator) defined stopping point, the subset of features with the highest score discovered up to that point is selected as the satisfactory feature subset.  The stopping criterion varies by algorithm; possible criteria include: a subset score exceeds a threshold, a program's maximum allowed run time has been surpassed, etc.\n\nAlternative search-based techniques are based on [[targeted projection pursuit]] which finds low-dimensional projections of the data that score highly: the features that have the largest projections in the lower-dimensional space are then selected.\n\nSearch approaches include:\n\n* Exhaustive\n* [[Best-first search|Best first]]\n* [[Simulated annealing]]\n* [[Genetic algorithm]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Soufan|first=Othman|last2=Kleftogiannis|first2=Dimitrios|last3=Kalnis|first3=Panos|last4=Bajic|first4=Vladimir B.|date=2015-02-26|title=DWFS: A Wrapper Feature Selection Tool Based on a Parallel Genetic Algorithm|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=10|issue=2|pages=e0117988|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0117988|pmid=25719748|pmc=4342225|issn=1932-6203|bibcode=2015PLoSO..1017988S}}</ref>\n* [[Greedy algorithm|Greedy]] forward selection<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Figueroa|first1=Alejandro|title=Exploring effective features for recognizing the user intent behind web queries|journal=Computers in Industry|date=2015|volume=68|pages=162\u2013169|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271911317|doi=10.1016/j.compind.2015.01.005}}</ref><ref>{{cite conference |last=Figueroa|first=Alejandro |author2=Guenter Neumann  |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259174469  |title=Learning to Rank Effective Paraphrases from Query Logs for Community Question Answering |conference= AAAI |year=2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Figueroa|first=Alejandro |author2=Guenter Neumann|title=Category-specific models for ranking effective paraphrases in community Question Answering|journal=Expert Systems with Applications|date=2014|volume=41|issue=10 |pages=4730\u20134742|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260519271|doi=10.1016/j.eswa.2014.02.004}}</ref>\n* Greedy backward elimination\n* [[Particle swarm optimization]]<ref name=\"sciencedirect.com\">{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=Y.|last2=Wang|first2=S.|last3=Phillips|first3=P.|title=Binary PSO with Mutation Operator for Feature Selection using Decision Tree applied to Spam Detection|journal=Knowledge-Based Systems|date=2014|volume=64|pages=22\u201331|doi=10.1016/j.knosys.2014.03.015}}</ref>\n* [[Targeted projection pursuit]]\n* Scatter Search<ref>F.C.

The aim is to penalise a feature's relevancy by its redundancy in the presence of the other selected features.

As mRMR approximates the combinatorial estimation problem with a series of much smaller problems, each of which only involves two variables, it thus uses pairwise joint probabilities which are more robust. In certain situations the algorithm may underestimate the usefulness of features as it has no way to measure interactions between features which can increase relevancy. This can lead to poor performance<ref name=\"Brown\" /> when the features are individually useless, but are useful when combined (a pathological case is found when the class is a [[parity function]] of the features). Overall the algorithm is more efficient (in terms of the amount of data required) than the theoretically optimal max-dependency selection, yet produces a feature set with little pairwise redundancy.\n\nmRMR is an instance of a large class of filter methods which trade off between relevancy and redundancy in different ways.<ref name=\"Brown\"/><ref name=\"docs.google\">Nguyen, H., Franke, K., Petrovic, S.

It is recently shown that QFPS is biased towards features with smaller entropy,<ref name=\"CMI\" /> due to its placement of the feature self redundancy term <math>I(f_i;f_i)</math> on the diagonal of {{mvar|H}}.\n\n=== Conditional mutual information ===\n\nAnother score derived for the mutual information is based on the conditional relevancy:<ref name=\"CMI\">Nguyen X.

The score tries to find the feature, that adds the most new information to the already selected features, in order to avoid redundancy. The score is formulated as follows:\n\n<math>\n\\begin{align}\nJMI(f_i) &= \\sum_{f_j \\in S} (I(f_i;c) + I(f_i;c|f_j)) \\\\\n         &= \\sum_{f_j \\in S} \\bigl[ I (f_j;c) + I (f_i;c) - \\bigl(I (f_i;f_j) - I (f_i;f_j|c)\\bigr)\\bigr]\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe score uses the [[conditional mutual information]] and the [[mutual information]] to estimate the redundancy between the already selected features (<math> f_j \\in S </math>) and the feature under investigation (<math>f_i</math>).\n\n==Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion Lasso based feature selection==\n\nFor high-dimensional and small sample data (e.g., dimensionality > {{10^|5}} and the number of samples < {{10^|3}}), the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion Lasso (HSIC Lasso) is useful.<ref name=\"HSICLasso\">{{cite journal |first=M. |last=Yamada |first2=W. |last2=Jitkrittum |first3=L. |last3=Sigal |first4=E.

A recent method called regularized tree<ref name=\"DengRunger2012\">H. Deng, G. Runger, \"[https://sites.google.com/site/houtaodeng/publications/FSRegularizedTrees.pdf?attredirects=0 Feature Selection via Regularized Trees]\", Proceedings of the 2012 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN), IEEE, 2012</ref> can be used for feature subset selection. Regularized trees penalize using a variable similar to the variables selected at previous tree nodes for splitting the current node. Regularized trees only need build one tree model (or one tree ensemble model) and thus are computationally efficient.\n\nRegularized trees naturally handle numerical and categorical features, interactions and nonlinearities. They are invariant to attribute scales (units) and insensitive to [[outlier]]s, and thus, require little data preprocessing such as [[Normalization (statistics)|normalization]]. Regularized random forest (RRF)<ref name=\"RRF\">[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RRF/index.html RRF: Regularized Random Forest], [[R (programming language)|R]] package on [[CRAN (R programming language)|CRAN]]</ref> is one type of regularized trees. The guided RRF is an enhanced RRF which is guided by the importance scores from an ordinary random forest.\n\n==Overview on metaheuristics methods==\nA [[metaheuristic]] is a general description of an algorithm dedicated to solve difficult (typically [[NP-hardness|NP-hard]] problem) optimization problems for which there is no classical solving methods. Generally, a metaheuristic is a stochastic algorithm tending to reach a global optimum. There are many metaheuristics, from a simple local search to a complex global search algorithm.\n\n===Main principles===\nThe feature selection methods are typically presented in three classes based on how they combine the selection algorithm and the model building.\n\n====Filter method====\n[[File:Filter Methode.png|thumb|300px|Filter Method for feature selection]]\nFilter type methods select variables regardless of the model. They are based only on general features like the correlation with the variable to predict. Filter methods suppress the least interesting variables. The other variables will be part of a classification or a regression model used to classify or to predict data. These methods are particularly effective in computation time and robust to overfitting.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite thesis |first=Julie |last=Hamon |title=Optimisation combinatoire pour la s\u00e9lection de variables en r\u00e9gression en grande dimension : Application en g\u00e9n\u00e9tique animale |url=https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-00920205 |date=November 2013 |publisher=[[Lille University of Science and Technology]] |language=fr }}</ref>\n\nFilter methods tend to select redundant variables when they do not consider the relationships between variables.

A son of [[John Hyrcanus]], he inherited the throne from his brother [[Aristobulus I]], and married his brother's widow, Queen [[Salome Alexandra]]. From his conquests to expand the kingdom to a bloody civil war, Alexander's reign has been generalised as cruel and oppressive with never-ending conflict.{{sfn|Saldarini|2001|p=89}} The major historical sources of Alexander's life are [[Josephus]]'s ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' and ''[[The Jewish War]]''.{{sfn|Atkinson|2016|p=100}}\n\nUnder Alexander Jannaeus's reign, the Jewish nation grew both in size and strength which hadn't been since the reign of [[Solomon]], [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|King of Israel]], having conquered most of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]'s [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coastline and regions surrounding the [[Jordan River]]. Alexander also had many of his subjects killed for their disapproval of his handling of state affairs. Due to his territorial expansion and interactions with his subjects, he was continuously embroiled with foreign wars and domestic turmoil.{{sfn|Gelb|2010|p=177}}\n\n== Family ==\nAlexander Jannaeus was the third son of John Hyrcanus by his second wife. When Aristobulus I, Hyrcanus' son by his first wife, became king, he deemed it necessary for his own security to imprison his half-brother. Aristobulus died after a reign of one year. Upon his death, his widow, [[Salome Alexandra]] had Alexander and his brothers released from prison. One of these brothers is said to have unsuccessfully sought the throne.\n\nAlexander, as the oldest living brother, had the right not only to the throne, but also to Salome, [[Yibbum|the widow of his deceased brother, who had died childless]]; and, although she was thirteen years older than him, he married her in accordance with Jewish law. By her he had two sons: the eldest, [[Hyrcanus II]], became high-priest in 62 BCE; and [[Aristobulus II]], who was high-priest from 66 - 62&nbsp;BCE and started a bloody civil war with his brother, ending in his capture by [[Pompey|Pompey the Great]]. Like his brother, he was an avid supporter of the aristocratic priestly faction known as the [[Sadducees]]. His wife Salome on the other hand, came from a [[pharisaic]] family (her brother was [[Simeon ben Shetach]], a famous [[Pharisee]] leader) and was more sympathetic to their cause and protected them throughout his turbulent reign.\n\nLike his father, Alexander also served as the [[High Priest of Israel|high priest]]. This raised the ire of the religious authorities who insisted that these two offices should not be combined. According to the [[Talmud]], Yannai was a questionable desecrated priest (rumour had it that his mother was captured in [[Modiin]] and violated) and, in the opinion of the Pharisees, was not allowed to serve in the [[Second Temple|temple]]. This infuriated the king and he sided with the Sadducees who defended him. This incident led the king to turn against the Pharisees and he persecute them until his death.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1144-alexander-jannaeus-jonathan|title=ALEXANDER JANN\u00c6US (Jonathan) - JewishEncyclopedia.com|website=jewishencyclopedia.com|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref>\n\n== War with Ptolemy Lathyrus ==\nAlexander's first expedition was against the city of [[Acre, Israel|Ptolemais]]. While Alexander went ahead to besiege the city, Zoilus of [[Dor, Israel|Dora]] took the opportunity to see if he could relieve Ptolemais in hopes of establishing his rule over coastal territories. Alexander's Hasmonean army quickly defeated Zoilus's forces. Ptolemais then requested aid from [[Ptolemy IX Lathyros]], who had been banished by his mother [[Cleopatra III of Egypt|Cleopatra III]]; Ptolemy founded a kingdom in [[History of Cyprus|Cyprus]] after being cast out by his mother. The situation at Ptolemais was seized as an opportunity by Ptolemy to possibly gain a stronghold and control the Judean coast in order to invade Egypt by sea. However, an individual named Demaenetus convinced the inhabitants of their imprudence in requesting Ptolemy's assistance. They realised that by allying themselves with Ptolemy, they had unintentionally declared war on Cleopatra. When Ptolemy arrived at the city, the inhabitants denied him access.{{sfn|Atkinson|2012|pp=130 & 131}}\n\nAlexander too didn't want to be involved in a war between Cleopatra and Ptolemy, so he abandoned his campaign against Ptolemais and returned to [[Jerusalem]]. After offering Ptolemy four hundred [[Talent (weight)|talents]] and a peace treaty in return for Zoilus's death, Alexander met him with treachery by negotiating an alliance with Cleopatra. Once he had formed an alliance with Ptolemy, Alexader continued his conquests by capturing the coastal cities of Dora and [[Caesarea Maritima|Straton's Tower]]. As soon as Ptolemy learned of Alexander's scheme, he was determined to kill him. Ptolemy put Ptolemais under siege, but left his generals to attack the city, while he continued to pursue Alexander. Ptolemy's pursuit caused much destruction in the [[Galilee|Galilee region]]. Here he captured [[Shikhin|Asochis]] on the [[Sabbath]], taking ten thousand people as prisoners. Ptolemy also initiated an unsuccessful attack on [[Sepphoris]].{{sfn|Atkinson|2012|pp=131 & 132}}\n\n=== Battle of Asophon ===\nPtolemy and Alexander engaged in battle at Asophon near the [[Jordan River]]. Estimated to have fifty to eighty thousand soldiers, Alexander's army consisted of both [[Jews]] and [[Paganism|pagans]]. At the head of his armed forces were his elite pagan mercenaries; they were specialised in [[Ancient Greek warfare|Greek-style]] [[phalanx]]. One of Ptolemy's commanders, Philostephanus, commenced the first attack by crossing the river that divided both forces. The Hasmoneans had the advantage, however, Philostephanus held back a certain amount of his forces whom he sent to recover lost ground. Perceiving them as vast reinforcements, Alexander's army fled. Some of his retreating forces tried to push back, but quickly dispersed as Ptolemy's forces pursued Alexander's fleeing army; thirty to fifty thousand Hasmonean soldiers died.{{sfn|Atkinson|2012|pp=132 & 133}}\n\nPtolemy's forces at Ptolemais also succeeded in capturing the city. He then continued to conquer much of the Hasmonean kingdom, occupying the entirety of northern Judea, the coast, and territories east of the Jordan River. While doing so, he pillaged villages and ordered his soldiers to cannibalise women and children to create psychological fear towards his enemies. At the time, Salome Alexandra was notified of Cleopatra's approachment to Judea.{{sfn|Atkinson|2012|pp=133 & 134}}\n\n=== Intervention of Cleopatra III ===\nRealising that her son had amassed a formidable force in Judea, Cleopatra appointed Jewish generals [[Ananias ben Onias|Ananias]] and [[Chelkias ben Onias|Chelkias]] to command her forces. She too also went with a fleet towards Judea. When Cleopatra arrived at Ptolemais, the people refused her entry, so she besieged the city. Ptolemy, believing Syria was defenseless, withdrew to Cyprus after his miscalculation. While in pursuit of Ptolemy, Chelkias died in [[Coele-Syria]].{{sfn|Atkinson|2012|p=134}}\n\nThe war abruptly came to an end with Ptolemy fleeing to Cyprus. Alexander then approached Cleopatra. Bowing before her, he requested to retain his rule. Cleopatra was urged by her subordinates to annex Judea. However, Ananias demanded she consider the residential Egyptian Jews who were the main support of her throne. This induced Cleopatra to modify her longings for Judea. Alexander though would meet her demands and suspend his campaigns. These negotiations took place at [[Beit She'an|Scythopolis]]. Cleopatra died five years later. Confident, after her death, Alexander found himself free to continue with new campaigns.{{sfn|Atkinson|2012|p=135}}\n\n== Transjordan and coastal conquest ==\n[[Image:Judea Alexander Janne\u00fcs.PNG|right|thumb|Hasmonean Kingdom under Alexander Jannaeus<br>{{legend|lime|situation in 103 BCE}}{{legend|fuchsia|area conquered}}]]\n\nAlexander captured [[Umm Qais|Gadara]] and fought to capture the strong fortress of [[Amathus, Transjordan|Amathus]] in the [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan]] region, but was defeated.{{sfn|Fitzgerald|Obbink|Holland|2004|pp=361 & 362}} He was more successful in his expedition against the coastal cities, capturing [[Rafah|Raphia]] and [[Anthedon (Palestine)|Anthedon]]. In 96 BCE, Jannaeus defeated the inhabitants of [[Gaza City|Gaza]]. This victory gained Judean control over the Mediterranean outlet of the main [[Nabataean Kingdom|Nabataean]] trade route.{{sfn|Sch\u00e4fer|2003|pp=74 & 75}} Alexander initially returned his focus back to the Transjordan region where, avenging his previous defeat, he destroyed Amathus.{{sfn|Fitzgerald|Obbink|Holland|2004|p=362}}\n\n=== Battle of Gaza ===\nDetermined to proceed with future campaigns despite his initial defeat at Amathus, Alexander set his focus on Gaza. A victory against the city wasn't so easily achieved. Gaza's general Apollodotus strategically employed a night attack against the Hasmonean army. With a force of two thousand less-skilled soldiers and ten thousand slaves, Gaza's military was able to deceive the Hasmonean army into believing they were being attacked by Ptolemy. The Gazans killed many and the Hasmonean army fled the battle. When morning exposed the delusive tactic, Alexader continued his assault but lost a thousand additional soldiers.{{sfn|Atkinson|2012|p=136}}\n\nThe Gazans still remained defiant in hopes that the Nabataean kingdom would come to their aid. The city, however, would eventually suffer defeat due to its own leadership. Gaza at the time was governed by two brothers, Lysimachus and Apollodotus. Lysimachus finally convinced the people to surrender, and Alexander peacefully entered the city. Though he at first seemed peaceful, Alexander suddenly turned against the inhabitants. Some men killed their wives and children out of desperation, to ensure they wouldn't be captured and enslaved. Others burned down their homes to prevent the soldiers from plundering. The town council and five hundred civilians took refuge at the [[Apollo|Temple of Apollo]], where Alexander had them massacred.{{sfn|Atkinson|2012|p=136}}\n\n== Judean Civil War ==\n=== War with Obodas I ===\nThe [[Judean Civil War]] initially began after the conquest of Gaza around 99 BCE. Due to Jannaeus's victory at Gaza, the Nabataean kingdom no longer had direct access to the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Alexander soon captured Gadara, which together with the loss of Gaza caused the Nabataeans to lose their main trade routes leading to [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] and [[Ancient City of Damascus|Damascus]]. After losing Gadara, the Nabataean king [[Obodas I]] launched an attack against Alexander in a steep valley at Gadara, where Alexander barely managed to escape. After his defeat in the [[Battle of Gadara]], Jannaeus returned to Jerusalem, only to be met with fierce Jewish opposition.{{sfn|Eshel|2008|pp=117 & 118}}\n\n=== Feast of Tabernacles ===\nDuring the Jewish holiday [[Sukkot]], Alexander Jannaeus, while officiating as the [[High Priest of Israel|High Priest]] at the Temple in Jerusalem, demonstrated his displeasure against the Pharisees by refusing to perform the water [[libation]] ceremony properly: instead of pouring it on the altar, he poured it on his feet. The crowd responded with shock at his mockery and showed their displeasure by pelting him with [[etrog]]im ([[citron]]s).{{sfn|Kaiser|1998|p=482}} They made the situation worse by insulting him. They called him a descendant of the [[Babylonian captivity|captives]] and unsuitable to hold office and to sacrifice. Outraged, he killed six thousand people. Alexander also had wooden barriers built around the altar and the temple preventing people from going near him. Only the priest were permitted to enter.{{sfn|Eshel|2008|pp=118}} This incident during the Feast of Tabernacles was a major factor leading up to the Judean Civil War.{{sfn|Kaiser|1998|p=482}}\n\n=== War with Demetrius III and conclusion of the Civil War ===\n[[File:WillemSwiddeAlexanderJannaeus.jpg|thumb|Alexander Jannaeus feasting during the crucifixion of the Pharisees, engraving by [[Willem Swidde]], seventeenth century]]\n\nAfter Jannaeus succeeded early in the war, the rebels asked for Seleucid assistance. Judean insurgents joined forces with [[Demetrius III Eucaerus]] to fight against Jannaeus. Alexander had gathered six thousand two hundred mercenaries and twenty thousand Jews for battle as Demetrius had forty thousand soldiers and three thousand horses. There were attempts from both sides to persuade each other to abandon positions but were unsuccessful. The Seleucid forces defeated Jannaeus at [[Shechem]], and all of Alexander's mercenaries were killed in battle. This defeat forced Alexander to take refuge in the mountains. In sympathy towards Jannaeus, six thousand Judean rebels ultimately returned to him. In fear of this news, Demetrius withdrew. Nevertheless, war between Jannaeus and the rebels who returned to him continued. They fought until Alexander achieved victory. Most of the rebels died in battle, while the remaining rebels fled to the city of Bethoma until they were defeated (Josephus, ''Antiquities'' 13.372-83).{{sfn|Eshel|2008|pp=118 & 119}}\n\nJannaeus had brought the surviving rebels back to Jerusalem where he had eight hundred Jews, primarily Pharisees, crucified. Before their deaths, Alexander had the rebels' wives and children executed before their eyes as Jannaeus ate with his concubines. Alexander later returned the land he had seized in [[Moab]] and [[Gilead#Places|Galaaditis]] from the Nabataeans in order to have them end their support for the Jewish rebels. The remaining rebels who numbered eight thousand, fled by night in fear of Alexander. Afterward, all rebel hostility ceased and Alexander's reign continued undisturbed.{{sfn|Eshel|2008|p=119}}\n\n== Final campaigns and death ==\nDuring his last years, Alexander continued campaigning in the east.{{sfn|Sch\u00e4fer|2003|p=75}} The Nabataean king [[Aretas III]] managed to defeat Alexander in battle, however, Alexander continued expanding the Hasmonean kingdom into [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan]].{{sfn|Sch\u00e4fer|2003|p=75}} In [[Gaulanitis]], he captured the cities of Gaulana, [[Seleucia Samulias|Seleucia]], [[Gamla|Gamala]]{{sfn|Sch\u00e4fer|2003|p=75}} and [[Hippos]];{{sfn|Fitzgerald|Obbink|Holland|2004|p=362}} in [[Gilead#Places|Galaaditis]], the cities of [[Pella]], [[Dium (Coele-Syria)|Dium]], and [[Jerash|Gerasa]].{{sfn|Sch\u00e4fer|2003|p=75}} Alexander had Pella destroyed for refusing to [[Judaization|Judaize]].{{sfn|Atkinson|2016|p=132}} Alexander captured all these cities in a period of three years (83-80 BCE). Three years later, Alexander had succumbed to an illness during the siege of [[Ragaba]].{{sfn|Sch\u00e4fer|2003|p=75}} Having reigned 27 years, Alexander Jannaeus died at the age of forty-nine.<ref>[[Josephus]], ''[[Antiquities of the Jews|Antiquities]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0146%3Abook%3D13%3Awhiston+chapter%3D15%3Awhiston+section%3D5 13.15.5]</ref>\n\n== Citations ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Atkinson|first1=Kenneth|title=Queen Salome: Jerusalem's Warrior Monarch of the First Century B.C.E|date=2012|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786490738|url= https://books.google.com/?id=mFZsgugWF_UC&pg=PA130 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Atkinson |first1=Kenneth |title=A History of the Hasmonean State: Josephus and Beyond |date=2016 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |isbn=9780567669032 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=SrfMDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=Alexander%20Jannaeus&f=false |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Eshel|first1=Hanan|title=The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Hasmonean State|date=2008|publisher=Wm.

The situation at Ptolemais was seized as an opportunity by Ptolemy to possibly gain a stronghold and control the Judean coast in order to invade Egypt by sea. However, an individual named Demaenetus convinced the inhabitants of their imprudence in requesting Ptolemy's assistance. They realised that by allying themselves with Ptolemy, they had unintentionally declared war on Cleopatra. When Ptolemy arrived at the city, the inhabitants denied him access.{{sfn|Atkinson|2012|pp=130 & 131}}\n\nAlexander too didn't want to be involved in a war between Cleopatra and Ptolemy, so he abandoned his campaign against Ptolemais and returned to [[Jerusalem]]. After offering Ptolemy four hundred [[Talent (weight)|talents]] and a peace treaty in return for Zoilus's death, Alexander met him with treachery by negotiating an alliance with Cleopatra. Once he had formed an alliance with Ptolemy, Alexader continued his conquests by capturing the coastal cities of Dora and [[Caesarea Maritima|Straton's Tower]]. As soon as Ptolemy learned of Alexander's scheme, he was determined to kill him. Ptolemy put Ptolemais under siege, but left his generals to attack the city, while he continued to pursue Alexander. Ptolemy's pursuit caused much destruction in the [[Galilee|Galilee region]]. Here he captured [[Shikhin|Asochis]] on the [[Sabbath]], taking ten thousand people as prisoners. Ptolemy also initiated an unsuccessful attack on [[Sepphoris]].{{sfn|Atkinson|2012|pp=131 & 132}}\n\n=== Battle of Asophon ===\nPtolemy and Alexander engaged in battle at Asophon near the [[Jordan River]]. Estimated to have fifty to eighty thousand soldiers, Alexander's army consisted of both [[Jews]] and [[Paganism|pagans]]. At the head of his armed forces were his elite pagan mercenaries; they were specialised in [[Ancient Greek warfare|Greek-style]] [[phalanx]]. One of Ptolemy's commanders, Philostephanus, commenced the first attack by crossing the river that divided both forces. The Hasmoneans had the advantage, however, Philostephanus held back a certain amount of his forces whom he sent to recover lost ground. Perceiving them as vast reinforcements, Alexander's army fled. Some of his retreating forces tried to push back, but quickly dispersed as Ptolemy's forces pursued Alexander's fleeing army; thirty to fifty thousand Hasmonean soldiers died.{{sfn|Atkinson|2012|pp=132 & 133}}\n\nPtolemy's forces at Ptolemais also succeeded in capturing the city. He then continued to conquer much of the Hasmonean kingdom, occupying the entirety of northern Judea, the coast, and territories east of the Jordan River. While doing so, he pillaged villages and ordered his soldiers to cannibalise women and children to create psychological fear towards his enemies. At the time, Salome Alexandra was notified of Cleopatra's approachment to Judea.{{sfn|Atkinson|2012|pp=133 & 134}}\n\n=== Intervention of Cleopatra III ===\nRealising that her son had amassed a formidable force in Judea, Cleopatra appointed Jewish generals [[Ananias ben Onias|Ananias]] and [[Chelkias ben Onias|Chelkias]] to command her forces. She too also went with a fleet towards Judea. When Cleopatra arrived at Ptolemais, the people refused her entry, so she besieged the city. Ptolemy, believing Syria was defenseless, withdrew to Cyprus after his miscalculation. While in pursuit of Ptolemy, Chelkias died in [[Coele-Syria]].{{sfn|Atkinson|2012|p=134}}\n\nThe war abruptly came to an end with Ptolemy fleeing to Cyprus. Alexander then approached Cleopatra. Bowing before her, he requested to retain his rule. Cleopatra was urged by her subordinates to annex Judea. However, Ananias demanded she consider the residential Egyptian Jews who were the main support of her throne. This induced Cleopatra to modify her longings for Judea. Alexander though would meet her demands and suspend his campaigns. These negotiations took place at [[Beit She'an|Scythopolis]]. Cleopatra died five years later. Confident, after her death, Alexander found himself free to continue with new campaigns.{{sfn|Atkinson|2012|p=135}}\n\n== Transjordan and coastal conquest ==\n[[Image:Judea Alexander Janne\u00fcs.PNG|right|thumb|Hasmonean Kingdom under Alexander Jannaeus<br>{{legend|lime|situation in 103 BCE}}{{legend|fuchsia|area conquered}}]]\n\nAlexander captured [[Umm Qais|Gadara]] and fought to capture the strong fortress of [[Amathus, Transjordan|Amathus]] in the [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan]] region, but was defeated.{{sfn|Fitzgerald|Obbink|Holland|2004|pp=361 & 362}} He was more successful in his expedition against the coastal cities, capturing [[Rafah|Raphia]] and [[Anthedon (Palestine)|Anthedon]]. In 96 BCE, Jannaeus defeated the inhabitants of [[Gaza City|Gaza]]. This victory gained Judean control over the Mediterranean outlet of the main [[Nabataean Kingdom|Nabataean]] trade route.{{sfn|Sch\u00e4fer|2003|pp=74 & 75}} Alexander initially returned his focus back to the Transjordan region where, avenging his previous defeat, he destroyed Amathus.{{sfn|Fitzgerald|Obbink|Holland|2004|p=362}}\n\n=== Battle of Gaza ===\nDetermined to proceed with future campaigns despite his initial defeat at Amathus, Alexander set his focus on Gaza. A victory against the city wasn't so easily achieved. Gaza's general Apollodotus strategically employed a night attack against the Hasmonean army. With a force of two thousand less-skilled soldiers and ten thousand slaves, Gaza's military was able to deceive the Hasmonean army into believing they were being attacked by Ptolemy. The Gazans killed many and the Hasmonean army fled the battle. When morning exposed the delusive tactic, Alexader continued his assault but lost a thousand additional soldiers.{{sfn|Atkinson|2012|p=136}}\n\nThe Gazans still remained defiant in hopes that the Nabataean kingdom would come to their aid. The city, however, would eventually suffer defeat due to its own leadership. Gaza at the time was governed by two brothers, Lysimachus and Apollodotus. Lysimachus finally convinced the people to surrender, and Alexander peacefully entered the city. Though he at first seemed peaceful, Alexander suddenly turned against the inhabitants. Some men killed their wives and children out of desperation, to ensure they wouldn't be captured and enslaved. Others burned down their homes to prevent the soldiers from plundering. The town council and five hundred civilians took refuge at the [[Apollo|Temple of Apollo]], where Alexander had them massacred.{{sfn|Atkinson|2012|p=136}}\n\n== Judean Civil War ==\n=== War with Obodas I ===\nThe [[Judean Civil War]] initially began after the conquest of Gaza around 99 BCE. Due to Jannaeus's victory at Gaza, the Nabataean kingdom no longer had direct access to the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Alexander soon captured Gadara, which together with the loss of Gaza caused the Nabataeans to lose their main trade routes leading to [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] and [[Ancient City of Damascus|Damascus]]. After losing Gadara, the Nabataean king [[Obodas I]] launched an attack against Alexander in a steep valley at Gadara, where Alexander barely managed to escape. After his defeat in the [[Battle of Gadara]], Jannaeus returned to Jerusalem, only to be met with fierce Jewish opposition.{{sfn|Eshel|2008|pp=117 & 118}}\n\n=== Feast of Tabernacles ===\nDuring the Jewish holiday [[Sukkot]], Alexander Jannaeus, while officiating as the [[High Priest of Israel|High Priest]] at the Temple in Jerusalem, demonstrated his displeasure against the Pharisees by refusing to perform the water [[libation]] ceremony properly: instead of pouring it on the altar, he poured it on his feet. The crowd responded with shock at his mockery and showed their displeasure by pelting him with [[etrog]]im ([[citron]]s).{{sfn|Kaiser|1998|p=482}} They made the situation worse by insulting him. They called him a descendant of the [[Babylonian captivity|captives]] and unsuitable to hold office and to sacrifice. Outraged, he killed six thousand people. Alexander also had wooden barriers built around the altar and the temple preventing people from going near him. Only the priest were permitted to enter.{{sfn|Eshel|2008|pp=118}} This incident during the Feast of Tabernacles was a major factor leading up to the Judean Civil War.{{sfn|Kaiser|1998|p=482}}\n\n=== War with Demetrius III and conclusion of the Civil War ===\n[[File:WillemSwiddeAlexanderJannaeus.jpg|thumb|Alexander Jannaeus feasting during the crucifixion of the Pharisees, engraving by [[Willem Swidde]], seventeenth century]]\n\nAfter Jannaeus succeeded early in the war, the rebels asked for Seleucid assistance. Judean insurgents joined forces with [[Demetrius III Eucaerus]] to fight against Jannaeus. Alexander had gathered six thousand two hundred mercenaries and twenty thousand Jews for battle as Demetrius had forty thousand soldiers and three thousand horses. There were attempts from both sides to persuade each other to abandon positions but were unsuccessful. The Seleucid forces defeated Jannaeus at [[Shechem]], and all of Alexander's mercenaries were killed in battle. This defeat forced Alexander to take refuge in the mountains. In sympathy towards Jannaeus, six thousand Judean rebels ultimately returned to him. In fear of this news, Demetrius withdrew. Nevertheless, war between Jannaeus and the rebels who returned to him continued. They fought until Alexander achieved victory. Most of the rebels died in battle, while the remaining rebels fled to the city of Bethoma until they were defeated (Josephus, ''Antiquities'' 13.372-83).{{sfn|Eshel|2008|pp=118 & 119}}\n\nJannaeus had brought the surviving rebels back to Jerusalem where he had eight hundred Jews, primarily Pharisees, crucified. Before their deaths, Alexander had the rebels' wives and children executed before their eyes as Jannaeus ate with his concubines. Alexander later returned the land he had seized in [[Moab]] and [[Gilead#Places|Galaaditis]] from the Nabataeans in order to have them end their support for the Jewish rebels. The remaining rebels who numbered eight thousand, fled by night in fear of Alexander. Afterward, all rebel hostility ceased and Alexander's reign continued undisturbed.{{sfn|Eshel|2008|p=119}}\n\n== Final campaigns and death ==\nDuring his last years, Alexander continued campaigning in the east.{{sfn|Sch\u00e4fer|2003|p=75}} The Nabataean king [[Aretas III]] managed to defeat Alexander in battle, however, Alexander continued expanding the Hasmonean kingdom into [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan]].{{sfn|Sch\u00e4fer|2003|p=75}} In [[Gaulanitis]], he captured the cities of Gaulana, [[Seleucia Samulias|Seleucia]], [[Gamla|Gamala]]{{sfn|Sch\u00e4fer|2003|p=75}} and [[Hippos]];{{sfn|Fitzgerald|Obbink|Holland|2004|p=362}} in [[Gilead#Places|Galaaditis]], the cities of [[Pella]], [[Dium (Coele-Syria)|Dium]], and [[Jerash|Gerasa]].{{sfn|Sch\u00e4fer|2003|p=75}} Alexander had Pella destroyed for refusing to [[Judaization|Judaize]].{{sfn|Atkinson|2016|p=132}} Alexander captured all these cities in a period of three years (83-80 BCE).

First a young woman Sania (Hania Amir) is sitting by the mountainsides of outer Islamabad in Pakistan. While enjoying several cups of tea, she looks up at the sky and stares in awe of a PAF (Pakistan Air Force) jet flying overby. In the next scene 3 enemy Mirage-2000's \"from the Eastern sector\" have infiltrated Pakistani airspace and 2 PAF JF-17's, piloted by Hamza Haider Ali (Hamza Ali Abbasi) and Nadir Kirmani (Shaz Khan) are scrambled to intercept them. After an intense aerial dogfight, Hamza shoots down one Mirage-2000 with a missile and tries to shoot down the second one with guns which end up jamming. Instead of following orders to retreat from the scene, he stays in the confrontation despite his weapons not functioning and provides cover for his wingman and best friend Nadir to shoot down the second jet with a missile. The third intruder retreats from the battle and Hamza and Nadir return home victorious. Hamza is however reprimanded by his commanding officer for taking such a dangerous risk during the battle with malfunctioning weapons but Hamza mentions how we was mirroring Squadron Leader Sarfaraz Ahmed Rafique's similar circumstances during the 1965 India-Pakistan war which led to his martyrdom.\n\nA group of young hopefuls who all want to become PAF Fighter Pilots are then shown travelling towards the PAF academy. These hopefuls include the bold but arrogant Saad Khan (Ahad Raza Mir), shy and hardworking Rashid Minhas Yousufzai (Sikander Vincent Khan Yousafzai), goofy Zaid Ali (Shafaat Ali), Shamir Hamid and female cadets Sania and Ujala. Sania is questioned by the selection committee (who are very hesitant to select her because of her barely meeting the physical height requirements despite her superior academics) as to why she wants to become a PAF fighter pilot despite having grown up in the United States since the age of 10 and having a foreign passport and education. She replies with the fact of her undying love for her home country and wanting to serve in the armed forces. All the candidates are then approved and selected for the GD fighter pilot training selection program. The new PAF trainees then undergo a tough physical and mental training routine by their superiors, often with hilarious outcomes. Over the course of the training Saad makes fun of Sania and the other female cadets and ridicules the fact of females trying to become fighter pilots, much to Sania's annoyance.\n\nThe film then shifts to Hamza preparing Nadir for his wedding to Fiza, who happens to be Sania's cousin. At the wedding Hamza meets Sania for the first time and is instantly smitten by her. He tries to court her and after some playful back and forth they soon start seeing each other and fall in love. Going on motorcycle trips and having several cups of tea by the mountainside becomes a regular activity for them. Hamza explains to Sania how he loves being a fighter pilot for Pakistan just like his dad was and Sania teases him to whether he would choose her or continue being a fighter pilot if he had to make a choice between the two. He gets hurt and offended even though she was only joking as he explains how he holds both things dear. She accepts this fact and becomes fully supportive of his career. After a rise in terrorist attacks by Taliban militants in the urban areas of Pakistan, the Pakistani Forces resolve to fight and rid the country of these militants once and for all, and Hamza and Nadir are chosen to fly on several bombing missions against them. Fiza who is now pregnant is worried for Nadir's safety, who reassures her that he will be fine. Sania is also worried for Hamza who reassures her that he will either return successful or as a \"shaheed\" (martyr) in which case he will live forever in the spiritual sense. When Sania's mother finds out about her relationship with Hamza, she is angered and forbids her to marry him on the grounds that Sania's father was a pilot as well who had died in a plane crash when Sania was a child and left Sania's mother as a young widow. She doesn't want Sania to go through the same thing and is very dismissive of Hamza when she meets him. However Hamza impresses Sania's mother with his patriotism and loyalty to making the citizens of Pakistan safe and his genuine love for Sania, after which she blesses their union. Hamza and Nadir then lead a formation of F-16's and carry out a successful strike against several senior Taliban militant leaders, some of whom were directly involved with the APS school massacre. Hamza takes out their compound with bombs while Nadir takes out a convoy using AGM's (Air to Ground Missiles).\n\nBack at the PAF academy, Saad performs well in flight training, but his weaknesses are exposed as a group leader when he is made leader of the cadets during a training expedition on the snowy slopes of Pakistan. Sania and Rashid then excel him in all other training courses and exercises after which he gets increasingly jealous of them both, especially after the other cadets make fun of him and when he starts to see Sania becoming good friends with Rashid. Zaid fails his flying course and decides to no longer continue. He then decides to leave the Airforce. When he nearly goes out off the door his friends, Saad and Rashid cry and then Zaid also becomes emotional. The scene then jumps to Sania coming close to failing as she has trouble with close formation flying. She gets very depressed, stating that she will be crushed if she does not become a fighter pilot. Even though Saad still continues to makes fun of her and the female cadets for joining the PAF, he affectionately gives her advice and tips on how to do well in close formation flying. Sania then passes and is elated but becomes even more elated when she learns that Rashid is being considered for the PAF's highest award for the cadets, the Sword of Honor. Saad becomes enraged at Rashid's success and Sania's happiness for him and lashes out verbally at Rashid after which Sania tells him off in front of everybody, humiliating him.\n\nThe scene then jumps to Hamza's parents informing him that they have gotten him engaged to a daughter of his father's close friend, after which he angrily informs them of marriage plans and love for Sania. While his mother is understanding, his father angrily refuses this union on the grounds that he has already promised his friend this marriage proposal and makes Hamza choose between Sania and his wishes. After Hamza chooses Sania, his father disowns him and refuses to speak with him ever again leaving Hamza very saddened. Later a convoy of Pakistani soldiers comes under attack by Taliban militants and gun mounted vehicles during a patrol, and Hamza and Nadir are scrambled to aid the soldiers under attack. Because the attack is happening near heavy civilian areas, Hamza deduces a plan to carry out a dangerous low altitude strike instead of dropping bombs from high a high altitude in order to minimize casualties, thus exposing himself to lots of anti-aircraft fire. Hamza and Nadir successfully destroy all the Taliban attackers and vehicles, however one militant is able to fire a MANPAD surface to air missile at Hamza's F-16 which sustains heavy damage forcing him to eject. Because of the low altitude, Hamza's parachute doesn't deploy properly and Hamza is critically injured but still continues to fight off militants with his pistol. An army helicopter is able to rescue him and kill the remaining militants and carry Hamza to a hospital but unfortunately his injuries are too severe and he instructs the staff to call Sania for him. After he tells her what happened she is devastated and heart broken but he tells her that since he will be a shaheed he will live forever in spirit and will always be with Sania in whatever she does in her life and that he loves her. He then succumbs to his injuries and embraces martyrdom.\n\nHamza's father is dismissive of his son's heroics as he believes he purposely chose to carry his mission out with such dangerous tactics because he was a coward and wanted to die instead living and facing the fact that he had shamed his father. But after meeting Sania at his grave she tells him how in that last phone conversation Hamza spoke lovingly about his father and how he wanted to make him proud. Hamza's father then comes to terms with this fact and is remorseful and becomes proud of his martyred son and accepts Sania as a daughter in spirit as well. It is here where it becomes apparent that it wasn't just Sania's patriotism that caused her to become a PAF fighter pilot, but that her whole journey and relationship with Hamza was a big factor as well, and that she wanted to live through him with his dream.\n\nBack in the present a frustrated Saad is pacing about in the gym when he is confronted by Rashid as to why Saad feels anger to him even though Rashid has no ill-feelings towards Saad. Saad cannot contain his anger anymore and knocks down Rashid challenging him to a fight, but he then sees a photo that drops out of Rashid's notebook. It is a picture of a village girl named Sherbatgul, and Saad finds out that she is Rashid's fianc\u00e9e whom Rashid loves and has every intention of marrying. Saad becomes embarrassed and realizes that he was jealous of Rashid for nothing as he had wrongly feared that Rashid was after Sania. He sincerely apologizes to Rashid and begs for his forgiveness. Rashid then laughs and is amused at the fact that the source of all of Saad's angst and frustration throughout all this time was his hidden love for Sania. During a dinner for the cadets, Rashid teasingly prods to Sania that Saad has something to tell her. Saad begins by apologizing for his behavior and attitude to Sania and when he tries to tell her how he feels about her, Sania becomes embarrassed when she realizes what he is trying to say and tries to act dismissive to him but Saad is left amused and hopeful. At the Graduation ceremony all the cadets pass and finally become fighter pilots and Sania receives the award for being the top academic performer, Saad receives the award for best aviator and Rashid as expected receives the Sword of Honor. All the PAF seniors are in attendance along with a promoted and decorated Nadir who is with his wife and his newborn son, who he has named Hamza after his old best friend.\n\nThe film then concludes with the same scenes from the beginning showing Sania still coming to the mountainside time to time enjoying several cups of tea by herself, remembering her time with Hamza and coming to full peace of having achieved both his and her dreams. A final scene shows Saad and Sania, now flying the JF-17's, exiting their planes after landing. Sania then sees a vision of Hamza's spirit, smiling at her and then saluting her. Sania and Saad then walking side by side and sharing a laugh and smile, hinting at a possible romance between the two in the future.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Hamza Ali Abbasi]] as Hamza Ali Haider\n* [[Shaz

First a young woman Sania (Hania Amir) is sitting by the mountainsides of outer Islamabad in Pakistan. While enjoying several cups of tea, she looks up at the sky and stares in awe of a PAF (Pakistan Air Force) jet flying overby. In the next scene 3 enemy Mirage-2000's \"from the Eastern sector\" have infiltrated Pakistani airspace and 2 PAF JF-17's, piloted by Hamza Haider Ali (Hamza Ali Abbasi) and Nadir Kirmani (Shaz Khan) are scrambled to intercept them. After an intense aerial dogfight, Hamza shoots down one Mirage-2000 with a missile and tries to shoot down the second one with guns which end up jamming. Instead of following orders to retreat from the scene, he stays in the confrontation despite his weapons not functioning and provides cover for his wingman and best friend Nadir to shoot down the second jet with a missile. The third intruder retreats from the battle and Hamza and Nadir return home victorious. Hamza is however reprimanded by his commanding officer for taking such a dangerous risk during the battle with malfunctioning weapons but Hamza mentions how we was mirroring Squadron Leader Sarfaraz Ahmed Rafique's similar circumstances during the 1965 India-Pakistan war which led to his martyrdom.\n\nA group of young hopefuls who all want to become PAF Fighter Pilots are then shown travelling towards the PAF academy. These hopefuls include the bold but arrogant Saad Khan (Ahad Raza Mir), shy and hardworking Rashid Minhas Yousufzai (Sikander Vincent Khan Yousafzai), goofy Zaid Ali (Shafaat Ali), Shamir Hamid and female cadets Sania and Ujala. Sania is questioned by the selection committee (who are very hesitant to select her because of her barely meeting the physical height requirements despite her superior academics) as to why she wants to become a PAF fighter pilot despite having grown up in the United States since the age of 10 and having a foreign passport and education. She replies with the fact of her undying love for her home country and wanting to serve in the armed forces. All the candidates are then approved and selected for the GD fighter pilot training selection program. The new PAF trainees then undergo a tough physical and mental training routine by their superiors, often with hilarious outcomes. Over the course of the training Saad makes fun of Sania and the other female cadets and ridicules the fact of females trying to become fighter pilots, much to Sania's annoyance.\n\nThe film then shifts to Hamza preparing Nadir for his wedding to Fiza, who happens to be Sania's cousin. At the wedding Hamza meets Sania for the first time and is instantly smitten by her. He tries to court her and after some playful back and forth they soon start seeing each other and fall in love. Going on motorcycle trips and having several cups of tea by the mountainside becomes a regular activity for them. Hamza explains to Sania how he loves being a fighter pilot for Pakistan just like his dad was and Sania teases him to whether he would choose her or continue being a fighter pilot if he had to make a choice between the two. He gets hurt and offended even though she was only joking as he explains how he holds both things dear. She accepts this fact and becomes fully supportive of his career. After a rise in terrorist attacks by Taliban militants in the urban areas of Pakistan, the Pakistani Forces resolve to fight and rid the country of these militants once and for all, and Hamza and Nadir are chosen to fly on several bombing missions against them. Fiza who is now pregnant is worried for Nadir's safety, who reassures her that he will be fine. Sania is also worried for Hamza who reassures her that he will either return successful or as a \"shaheed\" (martyr) in which case he will live forever in the spiritual sense. When Sania's mother finds out about her relationship with Hamza, she is angered and forbids her to marry him on the grounds that Sania's father was a pilot as well who had died in a plane crash when Sania was a child and left Sania's mother as a young widow. She doesn't want Sania to go through the same thing and is very dismissive of Hamza when she meets him. However Hamza impresses Sania's mother with his patriotism and loyalty to making the citizens of Pakistan safe and his genuine love for Sania, after which she blesses their union. Hamza and Nadir then lead a formation of F-16's and carry out a successful strike against several senior Taliban militant leaders, some of whom were directly involved with the APS school massacre. Hamza takes out their compound with bombs while Nadir takes out a convoy using AGM's (Air to Ground Missiles).\n\nBack at the PAF academy, Saad performs well in flight training, but his weaknesses are exposed as a group leader when he is made leader of the cadets during a training expedition on the snowy slopes of Pakistan. Sania and Rashid then excel him in all other training courses and exercises after which he gets increasingly jealous of them both, especially after the other cadets make fun of him and when he starts to see Sania becoming good friends with Rashid. Zaid fails his flying course and decides to no longer continue. He then decides to leave the Airforce. When he nearly goes out off the door his friends, Saad and Rashid cry and then Zaid also becomes emotional. The scene then jumps to Sania coming close to failing as she has trouble with close formation flying. She gets very depressed, stating that she will be crushed if she does not become a fighter pilot. Even though Saad still continues to makes fun of her and the female cadets for joining the PAF, he affectionately gives her advice and tips on how to do well in close formation flying. Sania then passes and is elated but becomes even more elated when she learns that Rashid is being considered for the PAF's highest award for the cadets, the Sword of Honor. Saad becomes enraged at Rashid's success and Sania's happiness for him and lashes out verbally at Rashid after which Sania tells him off in front of everybody, humiliating him.\n\nThe scene then jumps to Hamza's parents informing him that they have gotten him engaged to a daughter of his father's close friend, after which he angrily informs them of marriage plans and love for Sania. While his mother is understanding, his father angrily refuses this union on the grounds that he has already promised his friend this marriage proposal and makes Hamza choose between Sania and his wishes. After Hamza chooses Sania, his father disowns him and refuses to speak with him ever again leaving Hamza very saddened. Later a convoy of Pakistani soldiers comes under attack by Taliban militants and gun mounted vehicles during a patrol, and Hamza and Nadir are scrambled to aid the soldiers under attack. Because the attack is happening near heavy civilian areas, Hamza deduces a plan to carry out a dangerous low altitude strike instead of dropping bombs from high a high altitude in order to minimize casualties, thus exposing himself to lots of anti-aircraft fire. Hamza and Nadir successfully destroy all the Taliban attackers and vehicles, however one militant is able to fire a MANPAD surface to air missile at Hamza's F-16 which sustains heavy damage forcing him to eject. Because of the low altitude, Hamza's parachute doesn't deploy properly and Hamza is critically injured but still continues to fight off militants with his pistol. An army helicopter is able to rescue him and kill the remaining militants and carry Hamza to a hospital but unfortunately his injuries are too severe and he instructs the staff to call Sania for him. After he tells her what happened she is devastated and heart broken but he tells her that since he will be a shaheed he will live forever in spirit and will always be with Sania in whatever she does in her life and that he loves her. He then succumbs to his injuries and embraces martyrdom.\n\nHamza's father is dismissive of his son's heroics as he believes he purposely chose to carry his mission out with such dangerous tactics because he was a coward and wanted to die instead living and facing the fact that he had shamed his father. But after meeting Sania at his grave she tells him how in that last phone conversation Hamza spoke lovingly about his father and how he wanted to make him proud. Hamza's father then comes to terms with this fact and is remorseful and becomes proud of his martyred son and accepts Sania as a daughter in spirit as well. It is here where it becomes apparent that it wasn't just Sania's patriotism that caused her to become a PAF fighter pilot, but that her whole journey and relationship with Hamza was a big factor as well, and that she wanted to live through him with his dream.\n\nBack in the present a frustrated Saad is pacing about in the gym when he is confronted by Rashid as to why Saad feels anger to him even though Rashid has no ill-feelings towards Saad. Saad cannot contain his anger anymore and knocks down Rashid challenging him to a fight, but he then sees a photo that drops out of Rashid's notebook. It is a picture of a village girl named Sherbatgul, and Saad finds out that she is Rashid's fianc\u00e9e whom Rashid loves and has every intention of marrying. Saad becomes embarrassed and realizes that he was jealous of Rashid for nothing as he had wrongly feared that Rashid was after Sania. He sincerely apologizes to Rashid and begs for his forgiveness. Rashid then laughs and is amused at the fact that the source of all of Saad's angst and frustration throughout all this time was his hidden love for Sania. During a dinner for the cadets, Rashid teasingly prods to Sania that Saad has something to tell her. Saad begins by apologizing for his behavior and attitude to Sania and when he tries to tell her how he feels about her, Sania becomes embarrassed when she realizes what he is trying to say and tries to act dismissive to him but Saad is left amused and hopeful. At the Graduation ceremony all the cadets pass and finally become fighter pilots and Sania receives the award for being the top academic performer, Saad receives the award for best aviator and Rashid as expected receives the Sword of Honor. All the PAF seniors are in attendance along with a promoted and decorated Nadir who is with his wife and his newborn son, who he has named Hamza after his old best friend.\n\nThe film then concludes with the same scenes from the beginning showing Sania still coming to the mountainside time to time enjoying several cups of tea by herself, remembering her time with Hamza and coming to full peace of having achieved both his and her dreams. A final scene shows Saad and Sania, now flying the JF-17's, exiting their planes after landing. Sania then sees a vision of Hamza's spirit, smiling at her and then saluting her. Sania and Saad then walking side by side and sharing a laugh and smile, hinting at a possible romance between the two in the future.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Hamza Ali Abbasi]] as Hamza Ali Haider\n* [[Shaz

Attempting to counter the grim mood, General [[Louis Jules Trochu]] decided to attempt a breakout which could possibly link up with the French [[Arm\u00e9e de la Loire|Army of the Loire]].\n\n==French attack==\n[[File:Battle of Villiers map.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A map of the positions of the forces at 3:30 pm on 30 November]]\n\nOn 30 November [[Auguste-Alexandre Ducrot]] led 80,000 men towards the villages of [[Champigny-sur-Marne|Champigny]] and [[Bry-sur-Marne|Bry]] on the east bank of the [[Marne River]]. This section of the German lines was held by the W\u00fcrttemberg Division of the Prussian 3rd Army. On the 29th the Marne had flooded and a French reconnaissance attack turned into a disaster; 1,300 troops were lost. The main attack was to come the next day followed by a series of diversionary attacks. French artillery drove German advance units from the villages of Bry and Champigny and allowed Ducrot's troops to cross the Marne on pontoon bridges. Ducrot established a bridgehead on the opposite bank of the river at the two villages and advanced up a plateau towards [[Villiers-sur-Marne|Villiers]]. The W\u00fcrttemberg Division was so well entrenched that the French artillery did little to dislodge them and the attack stalled. Ducrot called on his III Corps, which had crossed the Marne north of Brie, to assault Villiers from the north. The III Corps hesitated too long for an attack to be of any use and now Ducrot was fighting a defensive battle.\n\n==German counterattack==\n[[File:Fond Giberne.jpg|thumb|right|''Le fond de la Giberne'', 1882, by [[Alphonse-Marie-Adolphe de Neuville|Alphonse de Neuville]].<br/>A dying French infantryman gives his last cartridges to a clairon]]\n[[Helmuth von Moltke the Elder|Helmuth von Moltke]], the Chief of Staff, was annoyed with the lack of energy which [[Albert, King of Saxony|Albert of Saxony]], commanding the Army of the Meuse, had shown in sending reinforcements to the W\u00fcrttemberg Division. Von Moltke ordered General [[Eduard von Fransecky]] to move with his [[II Corps (German Empire)|II Corps]] to the threatened area and assume command of all operations there. Fransecky however, had not been notified in time to do anything about the fight on the 30th. The two armies called a truce and buried their dead on 1 December. \n\nOn 2 December the Germans faced a similar situation to the [[battle of Le Bourget]]. Fransecky did not feel that a counterattack was necessary since the main German line had not been broken yet; Albert pushed for a counterattack anyway, just as he had at Le Bourget. Fransecky's attack was so rapid that it quickly took Champigny. The French then rallied and a stalemate ensued for the rest of the day. The situation worried von Moltke enough to cause him to draw up plans in case the French renewed their attack the following day and succeeded in breaking through. However, Ducrot had no intention of renewing the fight.

Attempting to counter the grim mood, General [[Louis Jules Trochu]] decided to attempt a breakout which could possibly link up with the French [[Arm\u00e9e de la Loire|Army of the Loire]].\n\n==French attack==\n[[File:Battle of Villiers map.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A map of the positions of the forces at 3:30 pm on 30 November]]\n\nOn 30 November [[Auguste-Alexandre Ducrot]] led 80,000 men towards the villages of [[Champigny-sur-Marne|Champigny]] and [[Bry-sur-Marne|Bry]] on the east bank of the [[Marne River]]. This section of the German lines was held by the W\u00fcrttemberg Division of the Prussian 3rd Army. On the 29th the Marne had flooded and a French reconnaissance attack turned into a disaster; 1,300 troops were lost. The main attack was to come the next day followed by a series of diversionary attacks. French artillery drove German advance units from the villages of Bry and Champigny and allowed Ducrot's troops to cross the Marne on pontoon bridges. Ducrot established a bridgehead on the opposite bank of the river at the two villages and advanced up a plateau towards [[Villiers-sur-Marne|Villiers]]. The W\u00fcrttemberg Division was so well entrenched that the French artillery did little to dislodge them and the attack stalled. Ducrot called on his III Corps, which had crossed the Marne north of Brie, to assault Villiers from the north. The III Corps hesitated too long for an attack to be of any use and now Ducrot was fighting a defensive battle.\n\n==German counterattack==\n[[File:Fond Giberne.jpg|thumb|right|''Le fond de la Giberne'', 1882, by [[Alphonse-Marie-Adolphe de Neuville|Alphonse de Neuville]].<br/>A dying French infantryman gives his last cartridges to a clairon]]\n[[Helmuth von Moltke the Elder|Helmuth von Moltke]], the Chief of Staff, was annoyed with the lack of energy which [[Albert, King of Saxony|Albert of Saxony]], commanding the Army of the Meuse, had shown in sending reinforcements to the W\u00fcrttemberg Division. Von Moltke ordered General [[Eduard von Fransecky]] to move with his [[II Corps (German Empire)|II Corps]] to the threatened area and assume command of all operations there. Fransecky however, had not been notified in time to do anything about the fight on the 30th. The two armies called a truce and buried their dead on 1 December. \n\nOn 2 December the Germans faced a similar situation to the [[battle of Le Bourget]]. Fransecky did not feel that a counterattack was necessary since the main German line had not been broken yet; Albert pushed for a counterattack anyway, just as he had at Le Bourget. Fransecky's attack was so rapid that it quickly took Champigny. The French then rallied and a stalemate ensued for the rest of the day. The situation worried von Moltke enough to cause him to draw up plans in case the French renewed their attack the following day and succeeded in breaking through. However, Ducrot had no intention of renewing the fight. His troops had suffered greatly in the cold and even though he received word that the Army of the Loire was moving towards Paris, he withdrew back into Paris by 4 December.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe fighting had been costly for both sides. The French had lost over 9,000 troops while the Germans lost over 3,000.
