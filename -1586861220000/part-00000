{"title_page": "Cadillac Northstar LMP", "text_new": "{{one source|date=May 2019}}\n[[Image:Cadillac Northstar LMP Mosport.jpg|thumb|300px|Cadillac Northstar LMP]]\nThe '''Cadillac Northstar LMP''' was a series of [[Le Mans Prototype]]s built by [[Cadillac]] for use in the [[American Le Mans Series]] as well as an attempt to return Cadillac to the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] since they first entered in {{24hLM|1950}}.  The Northstar LMPs were named after the [[GM Premium V engine|Northstar V8 engines]] which powered them.  The Cadillac project ran from 2000 until 2002 when [[General Motors]] decided to cancel the project to concentrate solely on their [[Chevrolet Corvette]] program. Cadillac returned to prototype racing in 2017 with the [[Cadillac DPi-V.R]] in the [[WeatherTech SportsCar Championship]].\n\n==Development==\n===2000===\nIn planning the new Cadillac LMP project, GM turned to [[Riley Technologies|Riley & Scott]], builders of the successful [[Riley & Scott Mk III|Mk III]] chassis.  Riley & Scott developed a from-scratch LMP based around a bespoke carbon fiber monocoque.  The new design featured elements of Cadillac's new Art & Science design theme such as the functional egg-crate grill on the nose, as well as the addition of large side scoops to feed the turbochargers.\n\nA highly modified {{Convert|650|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} version of this engine was used by General Motors racing division initially for [[Indy Racing League]] competition starting in 1995, then was later used in the Cadillac Northstar LMP program in 2000.  Both engines retained the 4.0&nbsp;L capacity, but the Northstar LMP version was twin-turbocharged.<ref name=Aurora>Weitzman, Larry (2001).[http://www.theautochannel.com/vehicles/new/reviews/2001/lweitzman_oldsmobile_aurora.html The Aurora by Oldsmobile (2001), Better in every respect]. ''Autochannel''. Retrieved on June 28, 2009.</ref> The engine for the Northstar LMP was based on a smaller 4.0 Liter variant of the Northstar used in Cadillacs, known as the L47, used in GM's [[Oldsmobile Aurora]] sedan.  It had already been adapted for racing in 1995 for use in the [[Indy Racing League]], but was thoroughly modified in order to not only increase power, but increase longevity.  McLaren Engines assisted in the development of the new prototype engine, while [[Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries]] (IHI) produced twin turbochargers to increase output.\n\nA total of seven monocoques were built, with two going to Team Cadillac in the United States, three to [[DAMS]] in France, one assigned as the crash test car (became the show car), and one spare tub that was delivered to GM at the end of the program.\n\n===2001===\nFor 2001, the Northstar LMP was evolved in order to make it more competitive against the Audi R8s.  Although still based on the Riley & Scott chassis, the bodywork was completely redesigned by Nigel Stroud.  A more angular approach was used, especially on the sides of the car, with the sidepods no longer being flat horizontal but instead diving downward towards the front wheel arch.  The air cooling ducts were also relocated from the side of the car, and instead placed inside the wheel wells, allowing for air exits from the wheel wells to be added to the new side.  The Cadillac-theme grill was also revised, no longer being a functional open piece.\n\nBeyond the bodywork, not much else was changed on the new car, known as the Northstar LMP01.  Two of the previous 2000-spec cars were upgraded to the 2001 bodywork, while a third car was built fresh.\n\n===2002===\n[[File:Cadillac Northstar LMP 900.jpg|thumb|right|Cadillac Northstar LMP 900 at the Le Mans Museum.]]\nFollowing two years of development of the Northstar V8 engine, Cadillac used 2002 to debut their new custom-built chassis.  No longer relying on Riley & Scott, the new Northstar LMP02 was designed by Nigel Stroud to be a completely different machine.  Although retaining some of the aerodynamic features of the Northstar LMP01, the new car featured a much more angular design.  Among the most noticeable features is the use of a raised footbox in the nose, allowing for a large air intake in the center and no longer employing the use of a stylized grill.  The air exits on the side were also closed down to a minimum width, leaving the design much cleaner.\n\nIn the engine department, the Northstar V8 was slightly altered, with the use of new [[Garrett AiResearch|Garrett]] turbochargers replacing the IHI units.  A new pneumatic shift system was also employed for the X-Trac gearbox.\n\nA total of three all new chassis were built for the Northstar LMP02.\n\n==Racing history==\n===2000===\nFor Cadillac's debut in 2000, GM decided to employ the use of two teams in two different championships in an attempt to maximize their preparation for Le Mans.  Riley & Scott would run the factory team in the [[American Le Mans Series]] under the name Team Cadillac, while Team [[DAMS]] of France would run a customer team in the European [[Sports Racing World Cup]].\n\nFor the [[24 Hours of Daytona]], the first race of the year, Team Cadillac would debut their two cars.  Alongside their [[Chevrolet Corvette]] teammates, the Northstar LMPs performed well early on, taking second and third in qualifying.  During the race the cars ran on pace, although after problems they found themselves nearly 100 laps behind the leading grand tourer cars.  Although one car suffered a gearbox in the closing moments of the race, both cars were classified as finishers, taking 13th and 14th places.  This was followed by the [[12 Hours of Sebring]], which saw both Team Cadillac and Team DAMS would be entered, with Cadillac running two cars and DAMS one.  The teams suffered some difficulties, with the DAMS entry breaking a clutch and one of the Team Cadillac entries being involved in an accident.  However, the third Northstar LMP was able to finish the race and take an encouraging sixth place, although it was 29 laps behind the winning [[Audi R8 (race car)|Audi R8]].\n\nReturning to Europe, DAMS debuted their first two car effort at the initial race of the Sports Racing World Cup.  There, the team managed to take home seventh and eighth places, a mere three laps behind the winning [[Ferrari 333 SP]].  DAMS would go on to take a fourth-place finish at the next round, although the other team car failed to finish.  At this time, the American Le Mans Series was having their first races in Europe.  DAMS entered their two car effort in place of Team Cadillac, managing to take fifth at [[Silverstone Circuit]].  DAMS would make one more Sports Racing World Cup appearance in May prior to going to Le Mans, where both cars did not finish.\n\nTeam Cadillac on the other hand, believing that private testing would be better for the Northstar LMP, would not return to the American Le Mans Series prior to flying to France for the [[2000 24 Hours of Le Mans|24 Hours of Le Mans]].  The cars lacked the pace necessary to compete with the major manufacturers in their class.  Although a DAMS entry managed to qualify ninth, the sister car could muster only the 20th fastest lap time.  The pace was equally off in the race, and mechanical woes saw only three Northstar LMPs finish, a disappointing 19th, 21st, and 22nd.\n\nFollowing Le Mans, DAMS participated in the second ALMS event in Europe, again taking fifth place, this time at the [[N\u00fcrburgring]].  Returning to America, Team Cadillac finally returned to action with a single car at [[Portland International Raceway]], managing eighth place.  [[Petit Le Mans]] would see DAMS return to the United States as well, with the four car Cadillac effort seeing better results.  All cars managed to finish, with the result of 6th, 7th, 8th, and 13th.  Team Cadillac would record one final finish for the year at [[Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca|Laguna Seca]] with a seventh-place finish before the time retired for the season, skipping the Las Vegas round.  DAMS made Cadillac's final appearance of the year at the [[Adelaide Street Circuit]] in [[Australia]].  DAMS would finish a distant 19th and 20th places.\n\nAt the end of the season, due to Team Cadillac's private testing, DAMS actually finished higher in the [[American Le Mans Series]] championship, taking seventh place over Cadillac's eighth.  In addition to this, DAMS points in the [[Sports Racing World Cup]] would earn them eighth in that championship.\n\n===2001===\nFor the new season, General Motors decided to alter their strategy.  Cadillac would prepare solely for the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] with private testing, with [[DAMS]] running only a two-car effort at the race.  Team Cadillac would assist in the effort, but then would run the [[American Le Mans Series]] only after Le Mans, when testing of the new Northstar LMP01 would be no longer necessary since General Motors was already aware that the all new Northstar LMP02 was in development.\n\nAt Le Mans, the DAMS entries showed the speed potential of the Northstar V8s by taking eighth in qualifying, beating out a new [[Bentley Speed 8|Bentley EXP Speed 8]], two of the [[Chrysler LMP]]s, and the [[Panoz]] squad.  During the race, one of the Northstar LMP01s was taken out in an early accident, but the sole surviving car managed to improve on the team's performance from last year by taking 15th place.\n\nNow returning to the United States, Team Cadillac began their involvement in the American Le Mans Series season at [[Infineon Raceway|Sears Point]].  Both cars suffered problems, and were only able to finish 12th and 24th.  Skipping Portland, the Cadillacs returned at [[Mosport]] and recorded their best finish ever, taking third and fourth places.  After a seven- and eighth-place finish at Mid-Ohio, the cars would take fourth and fifth at Laguna Seca, before finishing the season with another fourth- and fifth-place finish at the [[Petit Le Mans]].  Although Cadillac ran only half of the season, the team managed to be tied for fourth in the teams championship that year.\n\n===2002===\nWith the all new Northstar LMP02, Team Cadillac prepared once again for the 24 Hours of Le Mans.  Team DAMS was no longer involved in the project, leaving the American team to do all development of the new car.  Once again the decision was made to concentrate on private testing prior to Le Mans, although this year Cadillac would run the [[12 Hours of Sebring]].\n\nThe year did not start well for the Northstar LMP02 at Sebring.  One car suffered a failed electronics system towards the end of the race, while the sole remaining car came home a disappointing 31st.  Moving to Le Mans, the Cadillac showed its speed in qualifying once again by taking the eighth and tenth fastest qualifying times, beating out both an [[Audi]] and a [[Bentley]].  However the race itself saw the Northstar LMP02 show its potential, with both cars running in the top ten for most of the race.  Cadillac managed to take home ninth and twelfth places in the end, their best Le Mans result since the start of the program.\n\nReturning to the United States, Cadillac saw competition again in Washington D.C., where the team managed to take a fourth-place finish, only a single lap behind the winners.  Skipping Trois-Rivieres, Mosport saw the Northstar LMP02s finish third and sixth, followed by another third at Laguna Seca.  Cadillac's best race ever would finally come on the streets of Miami, where the LMP02 of [[JJ Lehto]] and [[Max Angelelli]] would take second place, a mere fourteen seconds behind the winning Audi.  The final race of the year, [[Petit Le Mans]], would see Cadillac coming home in third and fourth.  Once again, with only half a season, Cadillac would manage an impressive fifth in the championship.\n\nAt the end of 2002, General Motors announced that the Cadillac project would not continue into 2003.  Feeling that the Cadillac program had achieved what General Motors believed it was meant to, the project was canceled and GM would move to concentrating solely on their more successful [[Chevrolet Corvette#Racing|Chevrolet Corvette]] program.  General Motors would not offer any of the Northstar LMPs for sale to privateer customers, instead retaining the cars for themselves.\n\nIn 2009 GM decided to sell some of their specialty cars that were featured in the GM Museum.  The Cadillac LMP #8 (Chassis #02-002) was for the first time sold to a privateer.\n\n==Chassis history==\nA total of seven Riley & Scott-built Northstar LMP and Northstar LMP01s would be built, while a further three Northstar LMP02s would be built.

The Northstar LMPs were named after the [[GM Premium V engine|Northstar V8 engines]] which powered them.  The Cadillac project ran from 2000 until 2002 when [[General Motors]] decided to cancel the project to concentrate solely on their [[Chevrolet Corvette]] program. Cadillac returned to prototype racing in 2017 with the [[Cadillac DPi-V.R]] in the [[WeatherTech SportsCar Championship]].\n\n==Development==\n===2000===\nIn planning the new Cadillac LMP project, GM turned to [[Riley Technologies|Riley & Scott]], builders of the successful [[Riley & Scott Mk III|Mk III]] chassis.  Riley & Scott developed a from-scratch LMP based around a bespoke carbon fiber monocoque.  The new design featured elements of Cadillac's new Art & Science design theme such as the functional egg-crate grill on the nose, as well as the addition of large side scoops to feed the turbochargers.\n\nA highly modified {{Convert|650|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} version of this engine was used by General Motors racing division initially for [[Indy Racing League]] competition starting in 1995, then was later used in the Cadillac Northstar LMP program in 2000.  Both engines retained the 4.0&nbsp;L capacity, but the Northstar LMP version was twin-turbocharged.<ref name=Aurora>Weitzman, Larry (2001).[http://www.theautochannel.com/vehicles/new/reviews/2001/lweitzman_oldsmobile_aurora.html The Aurora by Oldsmobile (2001), Better in every respect]. ''Autochannel''. Retrieved on June 28, 2009.</ref> The engine for the Northstar LMP was based on a smaller 4.0 Liter variant of the Northstar used in Cadillacs, known as the L47, used in GM's [[Oldsmobile Aurora]] sedan.  It had already been adapted for racing in 1995 for use in the [[Indy Racing League]], but was thoroughly modified in order to not only increase power, but increase longevity.  McLaren Engines assisted in the development of the new prototype engine, while [[Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries]] (IHI) produced twin turbochargers to increase output.\n\nA total of seven monocoques were built, with two going to Team Cadillac in the United States, three to [[DAMS]] in France, one assigned as the crash test car (became the show car), and one spare tub that was delivered to GM at the end of the program.\n\n===2001===\nFor 2001, the Northstar LMP was evolved in order to make it more competitive against the Audi R8s.  Although still based on the Riley & Scott chassis, the bodywork was completely redesigned by Nigel Stroud.  A more angular approach was used, especially on the sides of the car, with the sidepods no longer being flat horizontal but instead diving downward towards the front wheel arch.  The air cooling ducts were also relocated from the side of the car, and instead placed inside the wheel wells, allowing for air exits from the wheel wells to be added to the new side.  The Cadillac-theme grill was also revised, no longer being a functional open piece.\n\nBeyond the bodywork, not much else was changed on the new car, known as the Northstar LMP01.  Two of the previous 2000-spec cars were upgraded to the 2001 bodywork, while a third car was built fresh.\n\n===2002===\n[[File:Cadillac Northstar LMP 900.jpg|thumb|right|Cadillac Northstar LMP 900 at the Le Mans Museum.]]\nFollowing two years of development of the Northstar V8 engine, Cadillac used 2002 to debut their new custom-built chassis.  No longer relying on Riley & Scott, the new Northstar LMP02 was designed by Nigel Stroud to be a completely different machine.  Although retaining some of the aerodynamic features of the Northstar LMP01, the new car featured a much more angular design.  Among the most noticeable features is the use of a raised footbox in the nose, allowing for a large air intake in the center and no longer employing the use of a stylized grill.  The air exits on the side were also closed down to a minimum width, leaving the design much cleaner.\n\nIn the engine department, the Northstar V8 was slightly altered, with the use of new [[Garrett AiResearch|Garrett]] turbochargers replacing the IHI units.  A new pneumatic shift system was also employed for the X-Trac gearbox.\n\nA total of three all new chassis were built for the Northstar LMP02.\n\n==Racing history==\n===2000===\nFor Cadillac's debut in 2000, GM decided to employ the use of two teams in two different championships in an attempt to maximize their preparation for Le Mans.  Riley & Scott would run the factory team in the [[American Le Mans Series]] under the name Team Cadillac, while Team [[DAMS]] of France would run a customer team in the European [[Sports Racing World Cup]].\n\nFor the [[24 Hours of Daytona]], the first race of the year, Team Cadillac would debut their two cars.  Alongside their [[Chevrolet Corvette]] teammates, the Northstar LMPs performed well early on, taking second and third in qualifying.  During the race the cars ran on pace, although after problems they found themselves nearly 100 laps behind the leading grand tourer cars.  Although one car suffered a gearbox in the closing moments of the race, both cars were classified as finishers, taking 13th and 14th places.  This was followed by the [[12 Hours of Sebring]], which saw both Team Cadillac and Team DAMS would be entered, with Cadillac running two cars and DAMS one.  The teams suffered some difficulties, with the DAMS entry breaking a clutch and one of the Team Cadillac entries being involved in an accident.  However, the third Northstar LMP was able to finish the race and take an encouraging sixth place, although it was 29 laps behind the winning [[Audi R8 (race car)|Audi R8]].\n\nReturning to Europe, DAMS debuted their first two car effort at the initial race of the Sports Racing World Cup.  There, the team managed to take home seventh and eighth places, a mere three laps behind the winning [[Ferrari 333 SP]].  DAMS would go on to take a fourth-place finish at the next round, although the other team car failed to finish.  At this time, the American Le Mans Series was having their first races in Europe.  DAMS entered their two car effort in place of Team Cadillac, managing to take fifth at [[Silverstone Circuit]].  DAMS would make one more Sports Racing World Cup appearance in May prior to going to Le Mans, where both cars did not finish.\n\nTeam Cadillac on the other hand, believing that private testing would be better for the Northstar LMP, would not return to the American Le Mans Series prior to flying to France for the [[2000 24 Hours of Le Mans|24 Hours of Le Mans]].  The cars lacked the pace necessary to compete with the major manufacturers in their class.  Although a DAMS entry managed to qualify ninth, the sister car could muster only the 20th fastest lap time.  The pace was equally off in the race, and mechanical woes saw only three Northstar LMPs finish, a disappointing 19th, 21st, and 22nd.\n\nFollowing Le Mans, DAMS participated in the second ALMS event in Europe, again taking fifth place, this time at the [[N\u00fcrburgring]].  Returning to America, Team Cadillac finally returned to action with a single car at [[Portland International Raceway]], managing eighth place.  [[Petit Le Mans]] would see DAMS return to the United States as well, with the four car Cadillac effort seeing better results.  All cars managed to finish, with the result of 6th, 7th, 8th, and 13th.  Team Cadillac would record one final finish for the year at [[Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca|Laguna Seca]] with a seventh-place finish before the time retired for the season, skipping the Las Vegas round.  DAMS made Cadillac's final appearance of the year at the [[Adelaide Street Circuit]] in [[Australia]].  DAMS would finish a distant 19th and 20th places.\n\nAt the end of the season, due to Team Cadillac's private testing, DAMS actually finished higher in the [[American Le Mans Series]] championship, taking seventh place over Cadillac's eighth.  In addition to this, DAMS points in the [[Sports Racing World Cup]] would earn them eighth in that championship.\n\n===2001===\nFor the new season, General Motors decided to alter their strategy.  Cadillac would prepare solely for the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] with private testing, with [[DAMS]] running only a two-car effort at the race.  Team Cadillac would assist in the effort, but then would run the [[American Le Mans Series]] only after Le Mans, when testing of the new Northstar LMP01 would be no longer necessary since General Motors was already aware that the all new Northstar LMP02 was in development.\n\nAt Le Mans, the DAMS entries showed the speed potential of the Northstar V8s by taking eighth in qualifying, beating out a new [[Bentley Speed 8|Bentley EXP Speed 8]], two of the [[Chrysler LMP]]s, and the [[Panoz]] squad.  During the race, one of the Northstar LMP01s was taken out in an early accident, but the sole surviving car managed to improve on the teams performance from last year by taking 15th place.\n\nNow returning to the United States, Team Cadillac began their involvement in the American Le Mans Series season at [[Infineon Raceway|Sears Point]].  Both cars suffered problems, and were only able to finish 12th and 24th.  Skipping Portland, the Cadillacs returned at [[Mosport]] and recorded their best finish ever, taking third and fourth places.  After a seven- and eighth-place finish at Mid-Ohio, the cars would take fourth and fifth at Laguna Seca, before finishing the season with another fourth- and fifth-place finish at the [[Petit Le Mans]].  Although Cadillac ran only half of the season, the team managed to be tied for fourth in the teams championship that year.\n\n===2002===\nWith the all new Northstar LMP02, Team Cadillac prepared once again for the 24 Hours of Le Mans.  Team DAMS was no longer involved in the project, leaving the American team to do all development of the new car.  Once again the decision was made to concentrate on private testing prior to Le Mans, although this year Cadillac would run the [[12 Hours of Sebring]].\n\nThe year did not start well for the Northstar LMP02 at Sebring.  One car suffered a failed electronics system towards the end of the race, while the sole remaining car came home a disappointing 31st.  Moving to Le Mans, the Cadillac showed its speed in qualifying once again by taking the eighth and tenth fastest qualifying times, beating out both an [[Audi]] and a [[Bentley]].  However the race itself saw the Northstar LMP02 show its potential, with both cars running in the top ten for most of the race.  Cadillac managed to take home ninth and twelfth places in the end, their best Le Mans result since the start of the program.\n\nReturning to the United States, Cadillac saw competition again in Washington D.C., where the team managed to take a fourth-place finish, only a single lap behind the winners.  Skipping Trois-Rivieres, Mosport saw the Northstar LMP02s finish third and sixth, followed by another third at Laguna Seca.  Cadillac's best race ever would finally come on the streets of Miami, where the LMP02 of [[JJ Lehto]] and [[Max Angelelli]] would take second place, a mere fourteen seconds behind the winning Audi.  The final race of the year, [[Petit Le Mans]], would see Cadillac coming home in third and fourth.  Once again, with only half a season, Cadillac would manage an impressive fifth in the championship.\n\nAt the end of 2002, General Motors announced that the Cadillac project would not continue into 2003.  Feeling that the Cadillac program had achieved what General Motors believed it was meant to, the project was canceled and GM would move to concentrating solely on their more successful [[Chevrolet_Corvette#Racing|Chevrolet Corvette]] program.  General Motors would not offer any of the Northstar LMPs for sale to privateer customers, instead retaining the cars for themselves.\n\nIn 2009 GM decided to sell some of their specialty cars that were featured in the GM Museum.  The Cadillac LMP #8 (Chassis #02-002) was for the first time sold to a privateer.\n\n==Chassis history==\nA total of seven Riley & Scott-built Northstar LMP and Northstar LMP01s would be built, while a further three Northstar LMP02s would be built.  Team [[Cadillac]] and [[DAMS]] would be the only teams to run the cars.\n\n'''#LMP-00-001'''\n* crash test car and show car, never raced\n'''#LMP-00-002'''\n* 2000 ([[DAMS]])\n:ALMS Sebring: DNF\n:SRWC Barcelona: 7th\n:SRWC Monza: 4th\n:ALMS Silverstone: DNF\n:SRWC Spa: DNF\n:Le Mans: DNF\n* Damaged in Le Mans fire, replaced by #LMP-00-006\n'''#LMP-00-003'''\n* 2000 (Team [[Cadillac]])\n:GARRC Daytona: 14th\n:ALMS Sebring: 6th\n:Le Mans: 21st\n:ALMS Petit Le Mans: 8th\n'''#LMP-00-004'''\n* 2000 (Team [[Cadillac]])\n:GARRC Daytona: 13th\n:ALMS Sebring: DNF\n:Le Mans: 22nd\n:ALMS Portland: 8th\n:ALMS Petit Le Mans: 7th\n:ALMS Laguna Seca: 7th\n* 2001 (Team [[Cadillac]])\n:Le Mans: 15th (run by [[DAMS]])\n:ALMS Sears Point: DNF\n:ALMS Mosport: 4th\n:ALMS Mid-Ohio: 7th\n:ALMS Laguna Seca: 4th\n:ALMS Petit Le Mans: 4th\n'''#LMP-00-005'''\n* 2000 ([[DAMS]])\n:SRWC Barcelona: 8th\n:SRWC Monza: DNF\n:ALMS Silverstone: 5th\n:SRWC Spa: DNF\n:Le Mans: 19th\n:ALMS N\u00fcrburgring: 16th\n:ALMS Petit Le Mans: 6th\n:ALMS Adelaide: DNF\n'''#LMP-00-006'''\n* 2000 ([[DAMS]])\n:ALMS N\u00fcrburgring: 5th\n:ALMS Petit Le Mans: 13th\n:ALMS Adelaide: DNF\n* 2001 (Team [[Cadillac]])\n:ALMS Sears Point: 12th\n:ALMS Mosport: 3rd\n:ALMS Mid-Ohio: 8th\n:ALMS Laguna Seca: 5th\n:ALMS Petit Le Mans: 5th\n'''#LMP-00-007'''\n* Spare monocoque delivered to GM at end of program.\n'''#LMP-02-001'''\n* 2002 (Team [[Cadillac]])\n:ALMS Sebring: DNF\n'''#LMP-02-002'''\n* 2002 (Team [[Cadillac]])\n:ALMS Sebring: 31st\n:Le Mans: 9th\n:ALMS Washington: 4th\n:ALMS Mosport: 3rd\n:ALMS Laguna Seca: 3rd\n:ALMS Miami: 2nd\n:ALMS Petit Le Mans: 3rd\n'''#LMP-02-003'''\n* 2002 (Team [[Cadillac]])\n:Le Mans: 12th\n:ALMS Washington: DNF\n:ALMS Mosport: 6th\n:ALMS Laguna Seca: DNF\n:ALMS Miami: 7th\n:ALMS Petit Le Mans: 4th\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Northstar engine series]]\n* [[Cadillac DPi-V.R]]\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.mulsannescorner.com/cadillac.htm Mulsannes Corner] - Northstar LMP\n* [http://www.mulsannescorner.com/cadillaclmp01.html Mulsannes Corner] - Northstar LMP01\n* [http://www.mulsannescorner.com/cadillaclmp02.html Mulsannes Corner] - Northstar LMP02\n{{Cadillac Vehicles}}\n[[Category:Le Mans Prototypes]]\n[[Category:Cadillac vehicles|Northstar]]\n[[Category:24 Hours of Le Mans race cars]]\n[[Category:Sports_prototypes]]\n", "name_user": "John of Reading", "label": "safe", "comment": "Typo/generalfixes, replaced: teams performance \u2192 team's performance", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadillac_Northstar_LMP"}

It is one of the city's two urban rail network hubs, along with [[Cardiff Queen Street railway station|Cardiff Queen Street]]. Opened in 1850 as ''Cardiff'' station, it was renamed ''Cardiff General'' in 1924, and then ''Cardiff Central'' in 1973.\n\nThe station is located at [[Central Square, Cardiff|Central Square]], in [[Cardiff city centre]]. The Grade II [[listed building]] is managed by [[Transport for Wales Rail|Transport for Wales]], and is both the largest and busiest station in Wales.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-46209535|title=Why Wales' quietest station got busier|last=Shuttleworth|first=Peter|date=2018-12-11|access-date=2020-01-11|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nCardiff Central is one of twenty [[List of railway stations in Cardiff|railway stations in the city]] and one of two in the city centre, serving as a hub for the [[Valleys & Cardiff Local Routes]]. It is an [[Interchange station|interchange]] for services between [[South Wales|South]] and [[West Wales]], as well as other major British cities.\n\nTransport for Wales operates services to most destinations in Wales and to [[Manchester Piccadilly station|Manchester]]; while [[CrossCountry]] operates trains to {{rws|Gloucester}}, Birmingham and {{rws|Nottingham}}. [[Great Western Railway (train operating company)|Great Western Railway]] runs all [[Paddington railway station|London Paddington]] intercity services via [[Bristol Parkway railway station|Bristol]] and to {{stn|Swansea}}, as well as some regional services to [[Bath Spa railway station|Bath]], {{rws|Taunton}} and [[Portsmouth Harbour railway station|Portsmouth]] via [[Southampton Central railway station|Southampton]];\n\n== History ==\n===Early history===\nIn the early 1840s the [[South Wales Railway]] was trying to find a suitable site for a railway station, but the area that is now Cardiff Central railway station was prone to flooding. It was [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]'s solution to divert the [[River Taff]] to the west, creating a larger and safer site for the station.<ref name=\"Brunel\">{{cite web |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Glamorgan/History/Cardiff_Arms_Park/Creation.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015004127/http://cricketarchive.com/Glamorgan/History/Cardiff_Arms_Park/Creation.html |archivedate=15 October 2012|publisher=Cardiff Council|title= Cardiff Arms Park, A short History \u2013 The Creation of the Arms Park|accessdate=22 May 2008}}</ref> The initial part of the South Wales Railway between {{rws|Chepstow}} and {{rws|Swansea}} through Cardiff was opened on 18 June 1850,  with all trains operated by the [[Great Western Railway]] (GWR) under a lease agreement.<ref>{{cite book| last=MacDermot| first=E.T.| title=History of the Great Western Railway, volume I 1833\u20131863| publisher=[[Great Western Railway]]| year=1927| location=London}}</ref>{{page needed|date=March 2017}} Through services from Cardiff to [[London Paddington station|London Paddington]] began on 19 July 1852, when the [[Chepstow Railway Bridge]] was opened, completing the connection between the South Wales Railway and the Great Western Railway. The South Wales Railway was absorbed into the GWR in 1863.{{sfn|Walters|1995|pp=9\u201310}}\n\nThe South Wales Railway had originally been built as a [[broad-gauge railway]], but on the weekend of 11\u201312 May 1872, the entire South Wales system was converted to [[standard-gauge railway|standard gauge]].{{sfn|Walters|1995|pp=9\u201310}}\n\nCardiff to London trains originally ran via the circuitous route via {{rws|Gloucester}} and took an average of five hours. This was reduced to around four hours from 1886 when the [[Severn Tunnel]] was opened creating a shorter route via [[Bristol]] and [[Bath Spa railway station|Bath]]. In 1903 another shortcut, the [[Badminton railway line]] was opened, bypassing Bath and Bristol, and this reduced the Cardiff-London journey times by another hour. By the 1930s, the fastest Cardiff-London trains took around 2 hours 40 minutes, and this remained fairly static until 1961, when the diesel [[Blue Pullman]] service reduced the fastest journey time to 2 hours 7 minutes. In October 1976 the current [[InterCity 125]] service was introduced, reducing the fastest journey times to 1 hour 53 minutes.{{sfn|Walters|1995|pp=18\u201320}}\n\nThe original 'Cardiff' station as it was then known had four through tracks running through the site, and consisted of two through platforms each with its own bay platform. During the 1890s the station underwent considerable expansion, in 1896 a flying junction was constructed connecting the station to nearby [[Cardiff Queen Street station]], and extra platforms were added to accommodate the new [[Taff Vale Railway|Taff Vale]] services, bringing the total number up to six.{{sfn|Walters|1995|pp=63\u201371}}\n\nInitially named ''Cardiff'', the station was renamed ''Cardiff General'' in July 1924 and then ''Cardiff Central'' by [[British Rail]] in May 1973.<ref>{{cite book| last=Butt| first=R.J.V.| title=The Directory of Railway Stations| year=1995| publisher=Patrick Stephens Ltd| page=53}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://pirate.cardiffschools.net/index1.htm| title=Cardiff Timeline| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929134414/http://pirate.cardiffschools.net/index1.htm| archivedate=29 September 2007}}</ref>\n\n===1930s rebuild===\n[[Image:Cardiff Central railway station concourse - 01.jpg|thumb|The interior of the concourse looking west]]\nBetween 1931 and 1934, the station underwent a major rebuild, designed by the GWR's architects department under their chief architect [[Percy Emerson Culverhouse]], the centrepiece of this was a new [[Art Deco]] entrance building faced in [[Portland stone]], containing a booking hall and concourse with noted Art Deco light fittings, all topped by a clock [[cupola]].<ref>{{cite web| title=Cardiff General Railway Station, Cardiff| url=http://www.coflein.gov.uk/en/site/34783/details/CARDIFF+GENERAL+RAILWAY+STATION%2C+CARDIFF/| work=Coflein| publisher=[[Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales]]| accessdate=1 April 2013}}</ref> The current Art Deco lamps in the booking hall are replicas of the originals, installed in 1999, having been funded by the [[Railway Heritage Trust]]. A GWR war memorial is located at the eastern end of the concourse.<ref name=\"HPCC\"/> The Great Western Railway has its full name carved onto the fa\u00e7ade (larger than the name of the station). The rebuild also saw a number of other improvements including the lengthening of the platforms, the widening of the Taff River railway bridge to allow the approach lines to the station to be quadrupled, and the installation of [[Railway signalling#Colour lights signals|colour-light signalling]]. The rebuild of the station cost the GWR \u00a3820,000 ({{Inflation|UK|820000|1934|r=-4|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}),{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}, and was formally opened by the then Minister of Transport [[Oliver Stanley]] on 26 February 1934.{{sfn|Walters|1995|pp=63\u201371}} \n\nIn July 1934, the GWR began a pioneering [[GWR railcars|diesel railcar service]] with a buffet between Cardiff General and {{rws|Birmingham Snow Hill}} which had only two stops at {{rws|Newport}} and {{rws|Gloucester}}. This was the first long distance diesel express service in Britain, covering the {{convert|117.5|miles|km}} between Cardiff and Birmingham in 2 hours 20 minutes.

It was [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]'s solution to divert the [[River Taff]] to the west, creating a larger and safer site for the station.<ref name=\"Brunel\">{{cite web |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Glamorgan/History/Cardiff_Arms_Park/Creation.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015004127/http://cricketarchive.com/Glamorgan/History/Cardiff_Arms_Park/Creation.html |archivedate=15 October 2012|publisher=Cardiff Council|title= Cardiff Arms Park, A short History \u2013 The Creation of the Arms Park|accessdate=22 May 2008}}</ref> The initial part of the South Wales Railway between {{rws|Chepstow}} and {{rws|Swansea}} through Cardiff was opened on 18 June 1850,  with all trains operated by the [[Great Western Railway]] (GWR) under a lease agreement.<ref>{{cite book| last=MacDermot| first=E.T.| title=History of the Great Western Railway, volume I 1833\u20131863| publisher=[[Great Western Railway]]| year=1927| location=London}}</ref>{{page needed|date=March 2017}} Through services from Cardiff to [[London Paddington station|London Paddington]] began on 19 July 1852, when the [[Chepstow Railway Bridge]] was opened, completing the connection between the South Wales Railway and the Great Western Railway. The South Wales Railway was absorbed into the GWR in 1863.{{sfn|Walters|1995|pp=9\u201310}}\n\nThe South Wales Railway had originally been built as a [[broad-gauge railway]], but on the weekend of 11\u201312 May 1872, the entire South Wales system was converted to [[standard-gauge railway|standard gauge]].{{sfn|Walters|1995|pp=9\u201310}}\n\nCardiff to London trains originally ran via the circuitous route via {{rws|Gloucester}} and took an average of five hours. This was reduced to around four hours from 1886 when the [[Severn Tunnel]] was opened creating a shorter route via [[Bristol]] and [[Bath Spa railway station|Bath]]. In 1903 another shortcut, the [[Badminton railway line]] was opened, bypassing Bath and Bristol, and this reduced the Cardiff-London journey times by another hour. By the 1930s, the fastest Cardiff-London trains took around 2 hours 40 minutes, and this remained fairly static until 1961, when the diesel [[Blue Pullman]] service reduced the fastest journey time to 2 hours 7 minutes. In October 1976 the current [[InterCity 125]] service was introduced, reducing the fastest journey times to 1 hour 53 minutes.{{sfn|Walters|1995|pp=18\u201320}}\n\nThe original 'Cardiff' station as it was then known had four through tracks running through the site, and consisted of two through platforms each with its own bay platform. During the 1890s the station underwent considerable expansion, in 1896 a flying junction was constructed connecting the station to nearby [[Cardiff Queen Street station]], and extra platforms were added to accommodate the new [[Taff Vale Railway|Taff Vale]] services, bringing the total number up to six.{{sfn|Walters|1995|pp=63\u201371}}\n\nInitially named ''Cardiff'', the station was renamed ''Cardiff General'' in July 1924 and then ''Cardiff Central'' by [[British Rail]] in May 1973.<ref>{{cite book| last=Butt| first=R.J.V.| title=The Directory of Railway Stations| year=1995| publisher=Patrick Stephens Ltd| page=53}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://pirate.cardiffschools.net/index1.htm| title=Cardiff Timeline| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929134414/http://pirate.cardiffschools.net/index1.htm| archivedate=29 September 2007}}</ref>\n\n===1930s rebuild===\n[[Image:Cardiff Central railway station concourse - 01.jpg|thumb|The interior of the concourse looking west]]\nBetween 1931 and 1934, the station underwent a major rebuild, designed by the GWR's architects department under their chief architect [[Percy Emerson Culverhouse]], the centrepiece of this was a new [[Art Deco]] entrance building faced in [[Portland stone]], containing a booking hall and concourse with noted Art Deco light fittings, all topped by a clock [[cupola]].<ref>{{cite web| title=Cardiff General Railway Station, Cardiff| url=http://www.coflein.gov.uk/en/site/34783/details/CARDIFF+GENERAL+RAILWAY+STATION%2C+CARDIFF/| work=Coflein| publisher=[[Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales]]| accessdate=1 April 2013}}</ref> The current Art Deco lamps in the booking hall are replicas of the originals, installed in 1999, having been funded by the [[Railway Heritage Trust]].

The rebuild also saw a number of other improvements including the lengthening of the platforms, the widening of the Taff River railway bridge to allow the approach lines to the station to be quadrupled, and the installation of [[Railway signalling#Colour lights signals|colour-light signalling]]. The rebuild of the station cost the GWR \u00a3820,000 ({{Inflation|UK|820000|1934|r=-4|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}),{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}, and was formally opened by the then Minister of Transport [[Oliver Stanley]] on 26 February 1934.{{sfn|Walters|1995|pp=63\u201371}} \n\nIn July 1934, the GWR began a pioneering [[GWR railcars|diesel railcar service]] with a buffet between Cardiff General and {{rws|Birmingham Snow Hill}} which had only two stops at {{rws|Newport}} and {{rws|Gloucester}}. This was the first long distance diesel express service in Britain, covering the {{convert|117.5|miles|km}} between Cardiff and Birmingham in 2 hours 20 minutes. It proved so successful that larger railcars with more seating and no buffet had to be introduced to cope with demand, and even this had to be augmented by a normal locomotive hauled service. During the Second World War, two such trains ran to and from Cardiff daily. At this time it consisted of a three car train consisting of a standard carriage sandwiched between two railcars, and a stop at {{rws|Stratford-upon-Avon}} was introduced.<ref>{{cite web|title=Great Western railcars.|url=http://www.greatwestern.org.uk/aec1.htm|publisher=The Great Western Archive|accessdate=14 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.warwickshirerailways.com/gwr/gwrsa1491.htm|title=Stratford on Avon Station: An unidentified Great Western Railway Diesel Railcar is seen passing Stratford on Avon West Signal Box on the up 9:10am Cardiff to Snow Hill service|website=www.warwickshirerailways.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.warwickshirerailways.com/gwr/gwrsa1509.htm|title=Stratford on Avon Station: GWR Diesel Railcars W37 W and W38 W are seen with a Third class coach in between departing on the up 5:05pm Cardiff to Birmingham service|website=www.warwickshirerailways.com}}</ref><ref name=\"JBoynShakl\">{{cite book|last1=Boynton|first1=John|title=Shakespeare's Railways|date=1994|publisher=Mid England Books|isbn=0-9522248-1-X}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of representations by the GWR, a nearby working-class district, [[Temperance Town, Cardiff|Temperance Town]], was cleared during the late 1930s in order to improve the outlook of the rebuilt station.<ref>{{cite web| last=Fisk| first=Stephen| title=Abandoned Communities \u2013 Temperance Town| date=June 2009| url=http://www.abandonedcommunities.co.uk/temperancetown3.html| accessdate=3 November 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 1992, the station, its entrances and platforms, became Grade II [[Listed buildings|listed]].<ref>{{cite web| title=Cardiff Central Station, Booking Hall, Passenger Subway, Platforms 1\u20134, 6 & 7 and Platform Buildings| url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-14063-cardiff-central-station-booking-hall-pass| publisher=British Listed Buildings| accessdate=1 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Cardiff Riverside Junction railway station===\n[[File:Cardiff Riverside railway station.jpg|thumb|Cardiff Riverside railway station in 1993, shortly before demolition.]]\nOn 14 August 1893 the GWR opened the adjacent '''Cardiff Riverside Junction''' station which had two platforms located to the south of and adjacent to the main Cardiff station which curved away to the south on the [[Cardiff Riverside Branch]], which ran to its terminus at {{rws|Clarence Road}} about one mile to the south.

Both active tools that scan through IPv4 or IPv6 network address ranges and passive tools that identify hosts based on analyzing their traffic should be employed.\n|-\n| System || 1.2 || If the organization is dynamically assigning addresses using DHCP, then deploy dynamic host configuration protocol&nbsp;(DHCP) server logging, and use this information to improve the asset inventory and help detect unknown systems.\n|-\n| System || 1.3 || Ensure that all equipment acquisitions automatically update the inventory system as new, approved devices are connected to the network.\n|-\n| System || 1.4 || Maintain an asset inventory of all systems connected to the network and the network devices themselves, recording at least the network addresses, machine name(s), purpose of each system, an asset owner responsible for each device, and the department associated with each device. The inventory should include every system that has an Internet protocol (IP) address on the network, including but not limited to desktops, laptops, servers, network equipment (routers, switches, firewalls, etc.), printers, storage area networks, Voice Over-IP telephones, multi-homed addresses, virtual addresses, etc. The asset inventory created must also include data on whether the device is a portable and/or personal device. Devices such as mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and other portable electronic devices that store or process data must be identified, regardless of whether they are attached to the organization's network.\n|-\n| System || 1.5 || Deploy network level authentication via 802.1x to limit and control which devices can be connected to the network. The 802.1x must be tied into the inventory data to determine authorized versus unauthorized systems.\n|-\n| System || 1.6 || Use client certificates to validate and authenticate systems prior to connecting to the private network.\n|- id=\"CSC2\"\n| colspan=\"3\" | '''[https://www.cisecurity.org/critical-controls/documents/CSC-MASTER-VER%206.0%20CIS%20Critical%20Security%20Controls%2010.15.2015.pdf#page=13 Critical Security Control #2: Inventory of Authorized and Unauthorized Software]'''\n|-\n| System || 2.1 || Devise a list of authorized software and version that is required in the enterprise for each type of system, including servers, workstations, and laptops of various kinds and uses. This list should be monitored by file integrity checking tools to validate that the authorized software has not been modified.\n|-\n| System || 2.2 || Deploy application whitelisting technology that allows systems to run software only if it is included on the whitelist and prevents execution of all other software on the system. The whitelist may be very extensive (as is available from commercial whitelist vendors), so that users are not inconvenienced when using common software. Or, for some special-purpose systems (which require only a small number of programs to achieve their needed business functionality), the whitelist may be quite narrow.\n|-\n| System || 2.3 || Deploy software inventory tools throughout the organization covering each of the operating system types in use, including servers, workstations, and laptops. The software inventory system should track the version of the underlying operating system as well as the applications installed on it. The software inventory systems must be tied into the hardware asset inventory so all devices and associated software are tracked from a single location.\n|-\n| System || 2.4 || Virtual machines and/or air-gapped systems should be used to isolate and run applications that are required for business operations but based on higher risk should not be installed within a networked environment. \n|- id=\"CSC3\"\n| colspan=\"3\" | '''[https://www.cisecurity.org/critical-controls/documents/CSC-MASTER-VER%206.0%20CIS%20Critical%20Security%20Controls%2010.15.2015.pdf#page=16 Critical Security Control #3: Secure Configurations for Hardware and Software]'''\n|-\n| System || 3.1 || Establish standard secure configurations of your operating systems and software applications. Standardized images should represent hardened versions of the underlying operating system and the applications installed on the system. These images should be validated and refreshed on a regular basis to update their security configuration in light of recent vulnerabilities and attack vectors.\n|-\n| System || 3.2 || Follow strict configuration management, building a secure image that is used to build all new systems that are deployed in the enterprise. Any existing system that becomes compromised should be re-imaged with the secure build. Regular updates or exceptions to this image should be integrated into the organization's change management processes. Images should be created for workstations, servers, and other system types used by the organization.\n|-\n| System || 3.3 || Store the master images on securely configured servers, validated with integrity checking tools capable of continuous inspection, and change management to ensure that only authorized changes to the images are possible. Alternatively, these master images can be stored in offline machines, air-gapped from the production network, with images copied via secure media to move them between the image storage servers and the production network.\n|-\n| System || 3.4 || Perform all remote administration of servers, workstation, network devices, and similar equipment over secure channels. Protocols such as telnet, VNC, RDP, or others that do not actively support strong encryption should only be used if they are performed over a secondary encryption channel, such as SSL, TLS or IPSEC.\n|-\n| System || 3.5 || Use file integrity checking tools to ensure that critical system files (including sensitive system and application executables, libraries, and configurations) have not been altered. The reporting system should: have the ability to account for routine and expected changes; highlight and alert on unusual or unexpected alterations; show the history of configuration changes over time and identify who made the change (including the original logged-in account in the event of a user ID switch, such as with the su or sudo command). These integrity checks should identify suspicious system alterations such as: owner and permissions changes to files or directories; the use of alternate data streams which could be used to hide malicious activities; and the introduction of extra files into key system areas (which could indicate malicious payloads left by attackers or additional files inappropriately added during batch distribution processes).\n|-\n| System || 3.6 || Implement and test an automated configuration monitoring system that verifies all remotely testable secure configuration elements, and alerts when unauthorized changes occur. This includes detecting new listening ports, new administrative users, changes to group and local policy objects (where applicable), and new services running on a system. Whenever possible use tools compliant with the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) in order to streamline reporting and integration.\n|-\n| System || 3.7 || Deploy system configuration management tools, such as Active Directory Group Policy Objects for Microsoft Windows systems or Puppet for UNIX systems that will automatically enforce and redeploy configuration settings to systems at regularly scheduled intervals. They should be capable of triggering redeployment of configuration settings on a scheduled, manual, or event-driven basis.\n|- id=\"CSC4\"\n| colspan=\"3\" | '''[https://www.cisecurity.org/critical-controls/documents/CSC-MASTER-VER%206.0%20CIS%20Critical%20Security%20Controls%2010.15.2015.pdf#page=20 Critical Security Control #4: Continuous Vulnerability Assessment and Remediation]'''\n|-\n| System || 4.1 || Run automated vulnerability scanning tools against all systems on the network on a weekly or more frequent basis and deliver prioritized lists of the most critical vulnerabilities to each responsible system administrator along with risk scores that compare the effectiveness of system administrators and departments in reducing risk. Use a SCAP-validated vulnerability scanner that looks for both code-based vulnerabilities (such as those described by Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures entries) and configuration-based vulnerabilities (as enumerated by the Common Configuration Enumeration Project).\n|-\n| System || 4.2 || Correlate event logs with information from vulnerability scans to fulfill two goals. First, personnel should verify that the activity of the regular vulnerability scanning tools is itself logged. Second, personnel should be able to correlate attack detection events with prior vulnerability scanning results to determine whether the given exploit was used against a target known to be vulnerable.\n|-\n| System || 4.3 || Perform vulnerability scanning in authenticated mode either with agents running locally on each end system to analyze the security configuration or with remote scanners that are given administrative rights on the system being tested. Use a dedicated account for authenticated vulnerability scans, which should not be used for any other administrative activities and should be tied to specific machines at specific IP addresses. Ensure that only authorized employees have access to the vulnerability management user interface and that roles are applied to each user.\n|-\n| System || 4.4 || Subscribe to vulnerability intelligence services in order to stay aware of emerging exposures, and use the information gained from this subscription to update the organization's vulnerability scanning activities on at least a monthly basis. Alternatively, ensure that the vulnerability scanning tools you use are regularly updated with all relevant important security vulnerabilities.\n|-\n| System || 4.5 || Deploy automated patch management tools and software update tools for operating system and software/applications on all systems for which such tools are available and safe. Patches should be applied to all systems, even systems that are properly air gapped.\n|-\n| System || 4.6 || Monitor logs associated with any scanning activity and associated administrator accounts to ensure that this activity is limited to the timeframes of legitimate scans. \n|-\n| System || 4.7 || Compare the results from back-to-back vulnerability scans to verify that vulnerabilities were addressed either by patching, implementing a compensating control, or documenting and accepting a reasonable business risk. Such acceptance of business risks for existing vulnerabilities should be periodically reviewed to determine if newer compensating controls or subsequent patches can address vulnerabilities that were previously accepted, or if conditions have changed, increasing the risk.\n|-\n| System || 4.8 || Establish a process to risk-rate vulnerabilities based on the exploitability and potential impact of the vulnerability, and segmented by appropriate groups of assets (example, DMZ servers, internal network servers, desktops, laptops). Apply patches for the riskiest vulnerabilities first. A phased rollout can be used to minimize the impact to the organization. Establish expected patching timelines based on the risk rating level. \n|- id=\"CSC5\"\n| colspan=\"3\" | '''[https://www.cisecurity.org/critical-controls/documents/CSC-MASTER-VER%206.0%20CIS%20Critical%20Security%20Controls%2010.15.2015.pdf#page=24 Critical Security Control #5: Controlled Use of Administrative Privileges]'''\n|-\n| System || 5.1 || Minimize administrative privileges and only use administrative accounts when they are required. Implement focused auditing on the use of administrative privileged functions and monitor for anomalous behavior.\n|-\n| System || 5.2 || Use automated tools to inventory all administrative accounts and validate that each person with administrative privileges on desktops, laptops, and servers is authorized by a senior executive.\n|-\n| System || 5.3 || Before deploying any new devices in a networked environment, change all default passwords for applications, operating systems, routers, firewalls, wireless access points, and other systems to have values consistent with administration-level accounts.\n|-\n| System || 5.4 || Configure systems to issue a log entry and alert when an account is added to or removed from a domain administrators\u2019 group, or when a new local administrator account is added on a system.\n|-\n| System || 5.5 || Configure systems to issue a log entry and alert on any unsuccessful login to an administrative account.\n|-\n| System || 5.6 || Use multifactor authentication for all administrative access, including domain administrative access. Multi-factor authentication can include a variety of techniques, to include the use of smart cards, certificates, One Time Password (OTP) tokens, biometrics, or other similar authentication methods.\n|-\n| System || 5.7 || Where multi-factor authentication is not supported, user accounts shall be required to use long passwords on the system (longer than 14 characters). \n|-\n| System || 5.8 || Administrators should be required to access a system using a fully logged and non-administrative account.

Tests can be periodically carried out by sending packets from bogon source IP addresses (non-routable or otherwise unused IP addresses) into the network to verify that they are not transmitted through network perimeters. Lists of bogon addresses are publicly available on the Internet from various sources, and indicate a series of IP addresses that should not be used for legitimate traffic traversing the Internet.\n|-\n| Network || 12.2 || On DMZ networks, configure monitoring systems (which may be built into the IDS sensors or deployed as a separate technology) to record at least packet header information, and preferably full packet header and payloads of the traffic destined for or passing through the network border. This traffic should be sent to a properly configured Security Information Event Management (SIEM) or log analytics system so that events can be correlated from all devices on the network.\n|-\n| Network || 12.3 || Deploy network-based IDS sensors on Internet and extranet DMZ systems and networks that look for unusual attack mechanisms and detect compromise of these systems. These network-based IDS sensors may detect attacks through the use of signatures, network behavior analysis, or other mechanisms to analyze traffic.\n|-\n| Network || 12.4 || Network-based IPS devices should be deployed to complement IDS by blocking known bad signatures or the behavior of potential attacks. As attacks become automated, methods such as IDS typically delay the amount of time it takes for someone to react to an attack. A properly configured network-based IPS can provide automation to block bad traffic. When evaluating network-based IPS products, include those using techniques other than signature-based detection (such as virtual machine or sandbox-based approaches) for consideration.\n|-\n| Network || 12.5 || Design and implement network perimeters so that all outgoing network traffic to the Internet must pass through at least one application layer filtering proxy server. The proxy should support decrypting network traffic, logging individual TCP sessions, blocking specific URLs, domain names, and IP addresses to implement a black list, and applying whitelists of allowed sites that can be accessed through the proxy while blocking all other sites. Organizations should force outbound traffic to the Internet through an authenticated proxy server on the enterprise perimeter.\n|-\n| Network || 12.6 || Require all remote login access (including VPN, dial-up, and other forms of access that allow login to internal systems) to use two-factor authentication.\n|-\n| Network || 12.7 || All enterprise devices remotely logging into the internal network should be managed by the enterprise, with remote control of their configuration, installed software, and patch levels.

These tools, which search for patterns that indicate the presence of sensitive information, can help identify if a business or technical process is leaving behind or otherwise leaking sensitive information.\n|-\n| Network || 13.5 || If there is no business need for supporting such devices, configure systems so that they will not write data to USB tokens or USB hard drives. If such devices are required, enterprise software should be used that can configure systems to allow only specific USB devices (based on serial number or other unique property) to be accessed, and that can automatically encrypt all data placed on such devices. An inventory of all authorized devices must be maintained.\n|-\n| Network || 13.6 || Use network-based DLP solutions to monitor and control the flow of data within the network. Any anomalies that exceed the normal traffic patterns should be noted and appropriate action taken to address them.\n|-\n| Network || 13.7 || Monitor all traffic leaving the organization and detect any unauthorized use of encryption. Attackers often use an encrypted channel to bypass network security devices.

Penetration testing should occur from outside the network perimeter (i.e., the Internet or wireless frequencies around an organization) as well as from within its boundaries (i.e., on the internal network) to simulate both outsider and insider attacks.\n|-\n| Application || 20.2 || Any user or system accounts used to perform penetration testing should be controlled and monitored to make sure they are only being used for legitimate purposes, and are removed or restored to normal function after testing is over.\n|-\n| Application || 20.3 || Perform periodic Red Team exercises to test organizational readiness to identify and stop attacks or to respond quickly and effectively.\n|-\n| Application || 20.4 || Include tests for the presence of unprotected system information and artifacts that would be useful to attackers, including network diagrams, configuration files, older penetration test reports, e-mails or documents containing passwords or other information critical to system operation.\n|-\n| Application || 20.5 || Plan clear goals of the penetration test itself with blended attacks in mind, identifying the goal machine or target asset. Many APT-style attacks deploy multiple vectors&mdash;often social engineering combined with web or network exploitation. Red Team manual or automated testing that captures pivoted and multi-vector attacks offers a more realistic assessment of security posture and risk to critical assets.\n|-\n| Application || 20.6 || Use vulnerability scanning and penetration testing tools in concert. The results of vulnerability scanning assessments should be used as a starting point to guide and focus penetration testing efforts.\n|-\n| Application || 20.7 || Wherever possible, ensure that Red Teams results are documented using open, machine-readable standards (e.g., SCAP). Devise a scoring method for determining the results of Red Team exercises so that results can be compared over time.\n|-\n| Application || 20.8 || Create a test bed that mimics a production environment for specific penetration tests and Red Team attacks against elements that are not typically tested in production, such as attacks against supervisory control and data acquisition and other control systems.\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://www.cisecurity.org/critical-controls.cfm \u201cTwenty Critical Security Controls for Effective Cyber Defense\u201d Website] (Center for Internet Security)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160809003039/https://www.cisecurity.org/critical-controls/documents/CSC-MASTER-VER%206.0%20CIS%20Critical%20Security%20Controls%2010.15.2015.pdf Direct link to CIS CSC version 6 pdf] (Center for Internet Security on archive.org)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160919021105/https://www.cisecurity.org/critical-controls/documents/CSC-MASTER-VER61-FINAL.pdf Direct link to CIS CSC version 6.1 pdf] (Center for Internet Security on archive.org)\n\n[[Category:Computer security]]\n", "text_old": "{{Underlinked|date=April 2016}}\n{{one source|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe [[Center for Internet Security]] [[The Center for Internet Security Critical Security Controls for Effective Cyber Defense|Critical Security Controls]] Version 6.0 was released October 15, 2015.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20161220072436/https://www.cisecurity.org/critical-controls/documents/CSC%20Press%20Release.pdf Press release v6.0 on cisecurity.org]</ref> It consists of:\n\n* [[CSC Version 6.0#CSC1|CSC 1]]: Inventory of Authorized and Unauthorized Devices\n* [[CSC Version 6.0#CSC2|CSC 2]]: Inventory of Authorized and Unauthorized Software\n* [[CSC Version 6.0#CSC3|CSC 3]]: Secure Configurations for Hardware and Software on Mobile Devices, Laptops, Workstations, and Servers\n* [[CSC Version 6.0#CSC4|CSC 4]]: Continuous Vulnerability Assessment and Remediation\n* [[CSC Version 6.0#CSC5|CSC 5]]: Controlled Use of Administrative Privileges\n* [[CSC Version 6.0#CSC6|CSC 6]]: Maintenance, Monitoring, and Analysis of Audit Logs\n* [[CSC Version 6.0#CSC7|CSC 7]]: Email and Web Browser Protections\n* [[CSC Version 6.0#CSC8|CSC 8]]: Malware Defenses\n* [[CSC Version 6.0#CSC9|CSC 9]]: Limitation and Control of Network Ports, Protocols, and Services\n* [[CSC Version 6.0#CSC10|CSC 10]]: Data Recovery Capability\n* [[CSC Version 6.0#CSC11|CSC 11]]: Secure Configurations for Network Devices such as Firewalls, Routers, and Switches\n* [[CSC Version 6.0#CSC12|CSC 12]]: Boundary Defense\n* [[CSC Version 6.0#CSC13|CSC 13]]: Data Protection\n* [[CSC Version 6.0#CSC14|CSC 14]]: Controlled Access Based on the Need to Know\n* [[CSC Version 6.0#CSC15|CSC 15]]: Wireless Access Control\n* [[CSC Version 6.0#CSC16|CSC 16]]: Account Monitoring and Control\n* [[CSC Version 6.0#CSC17|CSC 17]]: Security Skills Assessment and Appropriate Training to Fill Gaps\n* [[CSC Version 6.0#CSC18|CSC 18]]: Application Software Security\n* [[CSC Version 6.0#CSC19|CSC 19]]: Incident Response and Management\n* [[CSC Version 6.0#CSC20|CSC 20]]: Penetration Tests and Red Team Exercises\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Both active tools that scan through IPv4 or IPv6 network address ranges and passive tools that identify hosts based on analyzing their traffic should be employed.\n|-\n| System || 1.2 || If the organization is dynamically assigning addresses using DHCP, then deploy dynamic host configuration protocol&nbsp;(DHCP) server logging, and use this information to improve the asset inventory and help detect unknown systems.\n|-\n| System || 1.3 || Ensure that all equipment acquisitions automatically update the inventory system as new, approved devices are connected to the network.\n|-\n| System || 1.4 || Maintain an asset inventory of all systems connected to the network and the network devices themselves, recording at least the network addresses, machine name(s), purpose of each system, an asset owner responsible for each device, and the department associated with each device. The inventory should include every system that has an Internet protocol (IP) address on the network, including but not limited to desktops, laptops, servers, network equipment (routers, switches, firewalls, etc.), printers, storage area networks, Voice Over-IP telephones, multi-homed addresses, virtual addresses, etc. The asset inventory created must also include data on whether the device is a portable and/or personal device. Devices such as mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and other portable electronic devices that store or process data must be identified, regardless of whether they are attached to the organization's network.\n|-\n| System || 1.5 || Deploy network level authentication via 802.1x to limit and control which devices can be connected to the network. The 802.1x must be tied into the inventory data to determine authorized versus unauthorized systems.\n|-\n| System || 1.6 || Use client certificates to validate and authenticate systems prior to connecting to the private network.\n|- id=\"CSC2\"\n| colspan=\"3\" | '''[https://www.cisecurity.org/critical-controls/documents/CSC-MASTER-VER%206.0%20CIS%20Critical%20Security%20Controls%2010.15.2015.pdf#page=13 Critical Security Control #2: Inventory of Authorized and Unauthorized Software]'''\n|-\n| System || 2.1 || Devise a list of authorized software and version that is required in the enterprise for each type of system, including servers, workstations, and laptops of various kinds and uses. This list should be monitored by file integrity checking tools to validate that the authorized software has not been modified.\n|-\n| System || 2.2 || Deploy application whitelisting technology that allows systems to run software only if it is included on the whitelist and prevents execution of all other software on the system. The whitelist may be very extensive (as is available from commercial whitelist vendors), so that users are not inconvenienced when using common software. Or, for some special-purpose systems (which require only a small number of programs to achieve their needed business functionality), the whitelist may be quite narrow.\n|-\n| System || 2.3 || Deploy software inventory tools throughout the organization covering each of the operating system types in use, including servers, workstations, and laptops. The software inventory system should track the version of the underlying operating system as well as the applications installed on it. The software inventory systems must be tied into the hardware asset inventory so all devices and associated software are tracked from a single location.\n|-\n| System || 2.4 || Virtual machines and/or air-gapped systems should be used to isolate and run applications that are required for business operations but based on higher risk should not be installed within a networked environment. \n|- id=\"CSC3\"\n| colspan=\"3\" | '''[https://www.cisecurity.org/critical-controls/documents/CSC-MASTER-VER%206.0%20CIS%20Critical%20Security%20Controls%2010.15.2015.pdf#page=16 Critical Security Control #3: Secure Configurations for Hardware and Software]'''\n|-\n| System || 3.1 || Establish standard secure configurations of your operating systems and software applications. Standardized images should represent hardened versions of the underlying operating system and the applications installed on the system. These images should be validated and refreshed on a regular basis to update their security configuration in light of recent vulnerabilities and attack vectors.\n|-\n| System || 3.2 || Follow strict configuration management, building a secure image that is used to build all new systems that are deployed in the enterprise. Any existing system that becomes compromised should be re-imaged with the secure build. Regular updates or exceptions to this image should be integrated into the organization's change management processes. Images should be created for workstations, servers, and other system types used by the organization.\n|-\n| System || 3.3 || Store the master images on securely configured servers, validated with integrity checking tools capable of continuous inspection, and change management to ensure that only authorized changes to the images are possible. Alternatively, these master images can be stored in offline machines, air-gapped from the production network, with images copied via secure media to move them between the image storage servers and the production network.\n|-\n| System || 3.4 || Perform all remote administration of servers, workstation, network devices, and similar equipment over secure channels. Protocols such as telnet, VNC, RDP, or others that do not actively support strong encryption should only be used if they are performed over a secondary encryption channel, such as SSL, TLS or IPSEC.\n|-\n| System || 3.5 || Use file integrity checking tools to ensure that critical system files (including sensitive system and application executables, libraries, and configurations) have not been altered. The reporting system should: have the ability to account for routine and expected changes; highlight and alert on unusual or unexpected alterations; show the history of configuration changes over time and identify who made the change (including the original logged-in account in the event of a user ID switch, such as with the su or sudo command). These integrity checks should identify suspicious system alterations such as: owner and permissions changes to files or directories; the use of alternate data streams which could be used to hide malicious activities; and the introduction of extra files into key system areas (which could indicate malicious payloads left by attackers or additional files inappropriately added during batch distribution processes).\n|-\n| System || 3.6 || Implement and test an automated configuration monitoring system that verifies all remotely testable secure configuration elements, and alerts when unauthorized changes occur. This includes detecting new listening ports, new administrative users, changes to group and local policy objects (where applicable), and new services running on a system. Whenever possible use tools compliant with the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) in order to streamline reporting and integration.\n|-\n| System || 3.7 || Deploy system configuration management tools, such as Active Directory Group Policy Objects for Microsoft Windows systems or Puppet for UNIX systems that will automatically enforce and redeploy configuration settings to systems at regularly scheduled intervals. They should be capable of triggering redeployment of configuration settings on a scheduled, manual, or event-driven basis.\n|- id=\"CSC4\"\n| colspan=\"3\" | '''[https://www.cisecurity.org/critical-controls/documents/CSC-MASTER-VER%206.0%20CIS%20Critical%20Security%20Controls%2010.15.2015.pdf#page=20 Critical Security Control #4: Continuous Vulnerability Assessment and Remediation]'''\n|-\n| System || 4.1 || Run automated vulnerability scanning tools against all systems on the network on a weekly or more frequent basis and deliver prioritized lists of the most critical vulnerabilities to each responsible system administrator along with risk scores that compare the effectiveness of system administrators and departments in reducing risk. Use a SCAP-validated vulnerability scanner that looks for both code-based vulnerabilities (such as those described by Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures entries) and configuration-based vulnerabilities (as enumerated by the Common Configuration Enumeration Project).\n|-\n| System || 4.2 || Correlate event logs with information from vulnerability scans to fulfill two goals. First, personnel should verify that the activity of the regular vulnerability scanning tools is itself logged. Second, personnel should be able to correlate attack detection events with prior vulnerability scanning results to determine whether the given exploit was used against a target known to be vulnerable.\n|-\n| System || 4.3 || Perform vulnerability scanning in authenticated mode either with agents running locally on each end system to analyze the security configuration or with remote scanners that are given administrative rights on the system being tested. Use a dedicated account for authenticated vulnerability scans, which should not be used for any other administrative activities and should be tied to specific machines at specific IP addresses. Ensure that only authorized employees have access to the vulnerability management user interface and that roles are applied to each user.\n|-\n| System || 4.4 || Subscribe to vulnerability intelligence services in order to stay aware of emerging exposures, and use the information gained from this subscription to update the organization's vulnerability scanning activities on at least a monthly basis. Alternatively, ensure that the vulnerability scanning tools you use are regularly updated with all relevant important security vulnerabilities.\n|-\n| System || 4.5 || Deploy automated patch management tools and software update tools for operating system and software/applications on all systems for which such tools are available and safe. Patches should be applied to all systems, even systems that are properly air gapped.\n|-\n| System || 4.6 || Monitor logs associated with any scanning activity and associated administrator accounts to ensure that this activity is limited to the timeframes of legitimate scans. \n|-\n| System || 4.7 || Compare the results from back-to-back vulnerability scans to verify that vulnerabilities were addressed either by patching, implementing a compensating control, or documenting and accepting a reasonable business risk. Such acceptance of business risks for existing vulnerabilities should be periodically reviewed to determine if newer compensating controls or subsequent patches can address vulnerabilities that were previously accepted, or if conditions have changed, increasing the risk.\n|-\n| System || 4.8 || Establish a process to risk-rate vulnerabilities based on the exploitability and potential impact of the vulnerability, and segmented by appropriate groups of assets (example, DMZ servers, internal network servers, desktops, laptops). Apply patches for the riskiest vulnerabilities first. A phased rollout can be used to minimize the impact to the organization. Establish expected patching timelines based on the risk rating level. \n|- id=\"CSC5\"\n| colspan=\"3\" | '''[https://www.cisecurity.org/critical-controls/documents/CSC-MASTER-VER%206.0%20CIS%20Critical%20Security%20Controls%2010.15.2015.pdf#page=24 Critical Security Control #5: Controlled Use of Administrative Privileges]'''\n|-\n| System || 5.1 || Minimize administrative privileges and only use administrative accounts when they are required. Implement focused auditing on the use of administrative privileged functions and monitor for anomalous behavior.\n|-\n| System || 5.2 || Use automated tools to inventory all administrative accounts and validate that each person with administrative privileges on desktops, laptops, and servers is authorized by a senior executive.\n|-\n| System || 5.3 || Before deploying any new devices in a networked environment, change all default passwords for applications, operating systems, routers, firewalls, wireless access points, and other systems to have values consistent with administration-level accounts.\n|-\n| System || 5.4 || Configure systems to issue a log entry and alert when an account is added to or removed from a domain administrators\u2019 group, or when a new local administrator account is added on a system.\n|-\n| System || 5.5 || Configure systems to issue a log entry and alert on any unsuccessful login to an administrative account.\n|-\n| System || 5.6 || Use multifactor authentication for all administrative access, including domain administrative access. Multi-factor authentication can include a variety of techniques, to include the use of smart cards, certificates, One Time Password (OTP) tokens, biometrics, or other similar authentication methods.\n|-\n| System || 5.7 || Where multi-factor authentication is not supported, user accounts shall be required to use long passwords on the system (longer than 14 characters). \n|-\n| System || 5.8 || Administrators should be required to access a system using a fully logged and non-administrative account. Then, once logged on to the machine without administrative privileges, the administrator should transition to administrative privileges using tools such as Sudo on Linux/UNIX, RunAs on Windows, and other similar facilities for other types of systems.\n|-\n| System || 5.9 || Administrators shall use a dedicated machine for all administrative tasks or tasks requiring elevated access. This machine shall be isolated from the organization's primary network and not be allowed Internet access. This machine shall not be used for reading e-mail, composing documents, or surfing the Internet.\n|- id=\"CSC6\"\n| colspan=\"3\" | '''[https://www.cisecurity.org/critical-controls/documents/CSC-MASTER-VER%206.0%20CIS%20Critical%20Security%20Controls%2010.15.2015.pdf#page=27 Critical Security Control #6: Maintenance, Monitoring, and Analysis of Audit Logs]'''\n|-\n| System || 6.1 || Include at least two synchronized time sources from which all servers and network equipment retrieve time information on a regular basis so that timestamps in logs are consistent.\n|-\n| System || 6.2 || Validate audit log settings for each hardware device and the software installed on it, ensuring that logs include a date, timestamp, source addresses, destination addresses, and various other useful elements of each packet and/or transaction. Systems should record logs in a standardized format such as syslog entries or those outlined by the Common Event Expression initiative. If systems cannot generate logs in a standardized format, log normalization tools can be deployed to convert logs into such a format.\n|-\n| System || 6.3 || Ensure that all systems that store logs have adequate storage space for the logs generated on a regular basis, so that log files will not fill up between log rotation intervals. The logs must be archived and digitally signed on a periodic basis.\n|-\n| System || 6.4 || Have security personnel and/or system administrators run biweekly reports that identify anomalies in logs. They should then actively review the anomalies, documenting their findings.\n|-\n| System || 6.5 || Configure network boundary devices, including firewalls, network-based IPS, and inbound and outbound proxies, to verbosely log all traffic (both allowed and blocked) arriving at the device.\n|-\n| System || 6.6 || Deploy a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) or log analytic tools for log aggregation and consolidation from multiple machines and for log correlation and analysis. Using the SIEM tool, system administrators and security personnel should devise profiles of common events from given systems so that they can tune detection to focus on unusual activity, avoid false positives, more rapidly identify anomalies, and prevent overwhelming analysts with insignificant alerts. \n|- id=\"CSC7\"\n| colspan=\"3\" | '''[https://www.cisecurity.org/critical-controls/documents/CSC-MASTER-VER%206.0%20CIS%20Critical%20Security%20Controls%2010.15.2015.pdf#page=30 Critical Security Control #7: Email and Web Browser Protections]'''\n|-\n| System || 7.1 || Ensure that only fully supported web browsers and email clients are allowed to execute in the organization, ideally only using the latest version of the browsers provided by the vendor in order to take advantage of the latest security functions and fixes.\n|-\n| System || 7.2 || Uninstall or disable any unnecessary or unauthorized browser or email client plugins or add-on applications. Each plugin shall utilize application / URL whitelisting and only allow the use of the application for pre-approved domains.\n|-\n| System || 7.3 || Limit the use of unnecessary scripting languages in all web browsers and email clients. This includes the use of languages such as ActiveX and JavaScript on systems where it is unnecessary to support such capabilities.\n|-\n| System || 7.4 || Log all URL requests from each of the organization's systems, whether onsite or a mobile device, in order to identify potentially malicious activity and assist incident handlers with identifying potentially compromised systems.\n|-\n| System || 7.5 || Deploy two separate browser configurations to each system. One configuration should disable the use of all plugins, unnecessary scripting languages, and generally be configured with limited functionality and be used for general web browsing. The other configuration shall allow for more browser functionality but should only be used to access specific websites that require the use of such functionality.\n|-\n| System || 7.6 || The organization shall maintain and enforce network based URL filters that limit a system's ability to connect to websites not approved by the organization. The organization shall subscribe to URL categorization services to ensure that they are up-to-date with the most recent website category definitions available. Uncategorized sites shall be blocked by default. This filtering shall be enforced for each of the organization's systems, whether they are physically at an organization's facilities or not.\n|-\n| System || 7.7 || To lower the chance of spoofed e-mail messages, implement the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) by deploying SPF records in DNS and enabling receiver-side verification in mail servers.\n|-\n| System || 7.8 || Scan and block all e-mail attachments entering the organization's e-mail gateway if they contain malicious code or file types that are unnecessary for the organization's business. This scanning should be done before the e-mail is placed in the user's inbox. This includes e-mail content filtering and web content filtering.\n|- id=\"CSC8\"\n| colspan=\"3\" | '''[https://www.cisecurity.org/critical-controls/documents/CSC-MASTER-VER%206.0%20CIS%20Critical%20Security%20Controls%2010.15.2015.pdf#page=34 Critical Security Control #8: Malware Defenses]'''\n|-\n| System || 8.1 || Employ automated tools to continuously monitor workstations, servers, and mobile devices with anti-virus, anti-spyware, personal firewalls, and host-based IPS functionality. All malware detection events should be sent to enterprise anti-malware administration tools and event log servers.\n|-\n| System || 8.2 || Employ anti-malware software that offers a centralized infrastructure that compiles information on file reputations or have administrators manually push updates to all machines. After applying an update, automated systems should verify that each system has received its signature update.\n|-\n| System || 8.3 || Limit use of external devices to those with an approved, documented business need. Monitor for use and attempted use of external devices. Configure laptops, workstations, and servers so that they will not auto-run content from removable media, like USB tokens (i.e., \u201cthumb drives\u201d), USB hard drives, CDs/DVDs, FireWire devices, external serial advanced technology attachment devices, and mounted network shares. Configure systems so that they automatically conduct an anti-malware scan of removable media when inserted.\n|-\n| System || 8.4 || Enable anti-exploitation features such as Data Execution Prevention (DEP), Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), virtualization/containerization, etc. For increased protection, deploy capabilities such as Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) that can be configured to apply these protections to a broader set of applications and executables.\n|-\n| System || 8.5 || Use network-based anti-malware tools to identify executables in all network traffic and use techniques other than signature-based detection to identify and filter out malicious content before it arrives at the endpoint.\n|-\n| System || 8.6 || Enable domain name system (DNS) query logging to detect hostname lookup for known malicious C2 domains.\n|- id=\"CSC9\"\n| colspan=\"3\" | '''[https://www.cisecurity.org/critical-controls/documents/CSC-MASTER-VER%206.0%20CIS%20Critical%20Security%20Controls%2010.15.2015.pdf#page=37 Critical Security Control #9: Limitation and Control of Network Ports, Protocols, and Services]'''\n|-\n| System || 9.1 || Ensure that only ports, protocols, and services with validated business needs are running on each system.\n|-\n| System || 9.2 || Apply host-based firewalls or port filtering tools on end systems, with a default-deny rule that drops all traffic except those services and ports that are explicitly allowed.\n|-\n| System || 9.3 || Perform automated port scans on a regular basis against all key servers and compared to a known effective baseline. If a change that is not listed on the organization's approved baseline is discovered, an alert should be generated and reviewed.\n|-\n| System || 9.4 || Verify any server that is visible from the Internet or an untrusted network, and if it is not required for business purposes, move it to an internal VLAN and give it a private address.\n|-\n| System || 9.5 || Operate critical services on separate physical or logical host machines, such as DNS, file, mail, web, and database servers.\n|-\n| System || 9.6 || Place application firewalls in front of any critical servers to verify and validate the traffic going to the server.

To help ensure the ability to rapidly restore a system from backup, the operating system, application software, and data on a machine should each be included in the overall backup procedure. These three components of a system do not have to be included in the same backup file or use the same backup software. There should be multiple backups over time, so that in the event of malware infection, restoration can be from a version that is believed to predate the original infection. All backup policies should be compliant with any regulatory or official requirements.\n|-\n| System || 10.2 || Test data on backup media on a regular basis by performing a data restoration process to ensure that the backup is properly working.\n|-\n| System || 10.3 || Ensure that backups are properly protected via physical security or encryption when they are stored, as well as when they are moved across the network. This includes remote backups and cloud services.\n|-\n| System || 10.4 || Ensure that key systems have at least one backup destination that is not continuously addressable through operating system calls. This will mitigate the risk of attacks like CryptoLocker which seek to encrypt or damage data on all addressable data shares, including backup destinations.\n|- id=\"CSC11\"\n| colspan=\"3\" | '''[https://www.cisecurity.org/critical-controls/documents/CSC-MASTER-VER%206.0%20CIS%20Critical%20Security%20Controls%2010.15.2015.pdf#page=41 Critical Security Control #11: Secure Configurations for Network Devices]'''\n|-\n| Network || 11.1 || Compare firewall, router, and switch configuration against standard secure configurations defined for each type of network device in use in the organization. The security configuration of such devices should be documented, reviewed, and approved by an organization change control board. Any deviations from the standard configuration or updates to the standard configuration should be documented and approved in a change control system.\n|-\n| Network || 11.2 || All new configuration rules beyond a baseline-hardened configuration that allow traffic to flow through network security devices, such as firewalls and network-based IPS, should be documented and recorded in a configuration management system, with a specific business reason for each change, a specific individual's name responsible for that business need, and an expected duration of the need.\n|-\n| Network || 11.3 || Use automated tools to verify standard device configurations and detect changes. All alterations to such files should be logged and automatically reported to security personnel.\n|-\n| Network || 11.4 || Manage network devices using two-factor authentication and encrypted sessions.\n|-\n| Network || 11.5 || Install the latest stable version of any security-related updates on all network devices.\n|-\n| Network || 11.6 || Network engineers shall use a dedicated machine for all administrative tasks or tasks requiring elevated access.

This machine shall not be used for reading e-mail, composing documents, or surfing the Internet.\n|-\n| Network || 11.7 || Manage the network infrastructure across network connections that are separated from the business use of that network, relying on separate VLANs or, preferably, on entirely different physical connectivity for management sessions for network devices.\n|- id=\"CSC12\"\n| colspan=\"3\" | '''[https://www.cisecurity.org/critical-controls/documents/CSC-MASTER-VER%206.0%20CIS%20Critical%20Security%20Controls%2010.15.2015.pdf#page=44 Critical Security Control #12: Boundary Defense]'''\n|-\n| Network || 12.1 || Deny communications with (or limit data flow to) known malicious IP addresses (black lists), or limit access only to trusted sites (whitelists). Tests can be periodically carried out by sending packets from bogon source IP addresses (non-routable or otherwise unused IP addresses) into the network to verify that they are not transmitted through network perimeters. Lists of bogon addresses are publicly available on the Internet from various sources, and indicate a series of IP addresses that should not be used for legitimate traffic traversing the Internet.\n|-\n| Network || 12.2 || On DMZ networks, configure monitoring systems (which may be built into the IDS sensors or deployed as a separate technology) to record at least packet header information, and preferably full packet header and payloads of the traffic destined for or passing through the network border. This traffic should be sent to a properly configured Security Information Event Management (SIEM) or log analytics system so that events can be correlated from all devices on the network.\n|-\n| Network || 12.3 || Deploy network-based IDS sensors on Internet and extranet DMZ systems and networks that look for unusual attack mechanisms and detect compromise of these systems. These network-based IDS sensors may detect attacks through the use of signatures, network behavior analysis, or other mechanisms to analyze traffic.\n|-\n| Network || 12.4 || Network-based IPS devices should be deployed to complement IDS by blocking known bad signatures or the behavior of potential attacks. As attacks become automated, methods such as IDS typically delay the amount of time it takes for someone to react to an attack. A properly configured network-based IPS can provide automation to block bad traffic.

Owned by Florida businessman [[James Finch]], the team fielded entries from 1990 through 2013. The team fielded a wide variety of drivers and often changed manufacturers, though it often maintained a relationship with [[Hendrick Motorsports]]. In Sprint Cup, Phoenix Racing was victorious just once in 251 starts over 24 seasons.\n\nThe team was sold to Harry Scott, Jr. in September 2013, later renamed [[HScott Motorsports]].\n\n==Sprint Cup Series==\n===Car No. 51 history===\n====Early days====\nPhoenix Racing began racing in the Cup Series in [[1990 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|1990]], when it fielded the No. 51 [[Valspar|Plasti-Kote]] [[Chevrolet Lumina]] for [[Jeff Purvis]]. In four races, Purvis failed to finish a race, his best finishing being a 31st at [[North Wilkesboro Speedway]]. Phoenix attempted to run a full schedule in [[1991 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|1991]], but soon cut back to a part-time schedule, completing six races in total. Due to a lack of funding, the team only ran two races in [[1992 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|1992]], with Finch's company [[Phoenix Construction]] of [[Panama City, Florida]], serving as sponsor. In [[1993 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|1993]], the team ran all of the restrictor plate races on the schedule, except for the [[Daytona 500]], for which they failed to qualify. For [[1994 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|1994]], they picked up sponsorship from [[Country Time]] and had planned to run a limited schedule with [[Neil Bonnett]] driving. Bonnett was killed in a practice crash at Daytona before the [[1994 Daytona 500]], and Purvis was brought back to drive the car. In six races, his best finish was 21st. Phoenix changed its number to 44 in [[1995 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|1995]], and ran six more races with Purvis and [[Jackaroo Sauce]], only finishing one race. [[MCA Records]] became the new sponsor for [[1996 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|1996]], and the team had two top-ten qualification starts, but could not finish higher than twelfth.\n\n====2000s: Part-time and Talladega win====\nAfter staying out of Cup for several years, Finch purchased a number of [[Ford Taurus]]es from [[Bill Elliott Racing]], and ran all of the [[2001 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|2001]] schedule's restrictor plate races with Purvis driving the No. 51, only finishing one race. In [[2002 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|2002]], the team picked up funding from [[Miccosukee]] and switched to the No. 09. Driver Geoffrey Bodine had a third-place finish in the Daytona 500, and later had a 2nd-place qualification at the [[Pepsi 400]]. [[Mike Wallace (racing driver)|Mike Wallace]] ran a limited schedule for Phoenix in [[2003 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|2003]], and had two top-ten finishes. [[Scott Pruett]] and [[Buckshot Jones]] also ran one race deals for the team that season, during which they switched to [[Dodge]]. The team began [[2004 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series|2004]] with [[Joe Ruttman]] and [[Johnny Benson]] sharing the ride.  The idea was that Benson, who was also driving the team's Busch Series car, would run full races and Ruttman would [[start and park]] when he started. This drew criticism in the [[2004 Subway 400|Subway 400]], the second race of the season, at Rockingham when Ruttman entered with no pit crew, was parked by NASCAR after one lap, and collected $54,196 for a last-place finish.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fryer|first=Jenna|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/news/story?id=1743378|title=NASCAR calls Ruttman run 'a sham'|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=February 24, 2004|accessdate=January 25, 2014}}</ref> The team later said they would be \"legitimate racing\" after the incident and both Benson and Ruttman were eventually fired. [[Bobby Hamilton, Jr.]] then drove for six races during the middle of the season, before Wallace and [[Johnny Sauter]] returned to run the tail part of the season. Pruett and [[Tony Raines]], also ran in one-off attempts in the car. Sauter drove ten races in the No. 09 in [[2005 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series|2005]], and had a ninth-place finish at [[Phoenix International Raceway]]. Late in the season, [[Bobby Hamilton]] and [[Reed Sorenson]] drove the 09 at Martinsville and Homestead, respectively.\n\nBeginning in [[2006 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series|2006]], Phoenix abbreviated the 09's schedule even further, switching back and forth between Dodge and [[Ford]]. Mike Wallace ran just three races and failed to finish higher than seventeenth. Mayfield ran the season-ending [[Ford 400]], but did not finish due to an oil leak. Wallace had a fourth-place finish in the [[2007 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series|2007]] [[Daytona 500]], but the team did not qualify for another race until the final two races of the year, when Sterling Marlin drove. For [[2008 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series|2008]], Marlin ran 10\u201312 races for Phoenix.\n[[File:Sterling Marlin 2008 Miccosukee Chevy Impala.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The No. 09 car]]\nPhoenix Racing announced for 2009 that they would be running two different makes of cars for the upcoming Sprint Cup season. The No. 09 was shared by Marlin, Phoenix's Nationwide Series driver [[Mike Bliss]], and [[Brad Keselowski]], who at the time was a developmental driver for [[Hendrick Motorsports]]. [[Ron Fellows]] also ran as a road course ringer. The team fielded purchased Ganassi Dodges for Marlin and Bliss, and purchased Hendrick Chevrolets for Keselowski and Fellows.\n\nAfter 19 years in the Cup Series Phoenix Racing finally won its first race, taking the [[2009 Aaron's 499|Aaron's 499]] with Keselowski behind the wheel. Keselowski turned [[Carl Edwards]] when Edwards attempted a second block on Keselowski's passing move, but Keselowski held his ground as Edwards wrecked and drove to the finish to lead his only lap of the day and win the race.\n\n====2010s: full-time and sale====\nFormer [[Earnhardt Ganassi Racing]] driver [[Aric Almirola]] was hired to drive for the team in 2010. The team's competitiveness was put into question when it lost its longtime sponsor [[Miccosukee]] at the beginning of the season. Almirola failed to qualify three of the first seven events, including the Daytona 500, and [[start and park]]ed in its four starts due to lack of funds. Almirola left the team after the race at Phoenix to focus on his Truck Series efforts,<ref name=Bleacher-Finch-Almirola-2010>{{cite web|last1=Fan|first1=Horn|title=Aric Almirola's Sole Focus Is Now Camping World Truck Series|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/378554-aric-almirola-his-sole-focus-now-is-on-the-camping-world-truck-series|website=[[Bleacher Report]]|publisher=[[Bleacher Report]]|accessdate=November 26, 2014|date=April 14, 2010}}</ref> and was replaced by Mike Bliss and a handful of other drivers, including ([[Xfinity Series]] driver) [[Landon Cassill]], (Former [[F1]] driver) [[Jan Magnussen]], and ([[2000 NASCAR Winston Cup Series]] champion) [[Bobby Labonte]]. Phoenix Racing returned in 2011 despite rumors that Finch had been trying to sell the team. [[Bill Elliott]] drove the first 4 races before [[Landon Cassill]] took over the ride with sponsorship from [[Security Benefit]]. In June 2011, prior to the Kansas race, the team changed the car number to No. 51, which Phoenix Racing originally used when it first competed in the then-Winston Cup Series.

They ran four races together the following season in the No. 15 car, but had three engine failures. The next season, Phoenix and Purvis ran four consecutive races in the No. 14/23 [[Seal-Tech]] Buick, with a best finish of seventeenth. After a seventh-place finish at Talladega in [[1992 NASCAR Busch Series|1992]], the team ran as the No. 28 [[Havoline]] Ford for three races, and then changed to the No. 4 [[Kodak Funsaver Camera]] Chevrolet in [[1993 NASCAR Busch Series|1993]]. Purvis won his first pole at Talladega in [[1994 NASCAR Busch Series|1994]] as the No. 51 Country Time car, then switched back to the No. 4 Kodak car the next year, where he had three top-ten finishes.\n\nPhoenix Racing made its first full-time season in [[1996 NASCAR Busch Series|1996]], despite the No. 4 not having major sponsorship. Purvis won two races and a pole position, finishing seventh in points. Purvis ran the first four races of the [[1997 NASCAR Busch Series|1997]], and had a top-ten finish, but was replaced by [[Tim Steele (racing driver)|Tim Steele]], who brought sponsorship from [[HS Die]]. He had two top-tens, but injuries forced him to exit the ride. He was replaced by multiple drivers, with [[Dale Shaw]] running a majority of the races that season, including a 2nd-place finish at [[South Boston Speedway]]. Sterling Marlin, [[Ernie Irvan]], and [[Ron Fellows]] filled in for Shaw when he could not run. [[Kevin Lepage]] then drove two races near the end of the season, before Purvis returned to drive the last race of the year. In [[1998 NASCAR Busch Series|1998]], Purvis was again named full-time driver, with [[Lance Snacks]] sponsoring. Purvis made 26 starts, missing one race due to injury, during which he was replaced by [[Dennis Setzer]], and an additional four races during which he was suspended for rough driving. [[Nathan Buttke]] and [[Matt Hutter]] took his place for those races.\n\nPurvis and Lance Snacks departed for [[Joe Gibbs Racing|Bechtel/Gibbs Racing]] at the end of the year, taking the No. 4 with him. Phoenix Racing switched to the No. 1 and hired [[Randy LaJoie]] to drive. They did not have major sponsorship of start the season, and signed a one-race deal with [[Jani-King]] before winning the season-opening [[NAPA Auto Parts 300]]. [[Bob Evans Restaurants]] then became the sponsor, and LaJoie finished tenth in points. He followed that up with a victory at [[Nashville Speedway|USA]] and a seventh-place finish in points in [[2000 NASCAR Busch Series|2000]]. [[P. J. Jones]] was named driver of the No. 1 for [[2001 NASCAR Busch Series|2001]], bringing [[Yellow Freight]] sponsorship. After four races, he was replaced by [[Jimmy Spencer]] who drove in eighteen races for Phoenix, winning three races. Bobby Hamilton, Lepage, and Joe Ruttman filled in for Spencer on occasion. \n\nPhoenix dropped to a part-time schedule in [[2002 NASCAR Busch Series|2002]], with Spencer winning twice in 23 races, and Ruttman and [[Martin Truex, Jr.]] running one race apiece. In [[2003 NASCAR Busch Series|2003]], they formed a partnership with [[Chip Ganassi Racing]] and fielded the No. 1 full-time for two Ganassi drivers: Cup series driver Jamie McMurray and developmental driver [[David Stremme]]. McMurray had two wins, both at [[Rockingham Speedway|Rockingham]], while Stremme made sixteen starts with two top-fives, earning him Rookie of the Year honors.\n\n[[Johnny Benson]] was named full-time driver in [[2004 NASCAR Busch Series|2004]], with Miccosukee Resorts being named the new sponsor. He won one pole and had four top-tens when he was released after ten starts. McMurray ran three of the next four races, and Purvis returned for one race at [[Nazareth Speedway]]. Buckshot Jones drove the next two races with the return of Yellow Transportation to the team, followed by [[Tony Raines]], [[Casey Mears]], Bobby Hamilton, Sterling Marlin, Reed Sorenson, and [[Regan Smith]]. \n\n[[Johnny Sauter]] was named the permanent driver of the No. 1 in [[2005 NASCAR Busch Series|2005]], winning at Milwaukee and finishing twelfth in points after [[Boris Said]] took his place at the Mexico race. Sauter left for [[Stewart-Haas Racing|Haas CNC Racing]] and took the sponsorship with him, and [[Jason Keller]] was hired to drive. After eight races, Keller was released and replaced by Mike Wallace, who garnered two top-five finishes, with [[Scott Pruett]] and development driver [[Cale Gale]] filling in. For [[2007 NASCAR Busch Series|2007]], [[J. J. Yeley]] was named the new driver of the No. 1, but struggled and only had one top-ten finish and missed six races, with Benson, Marlin and Max Papis filling for most of those races.\n\nIn [[2008 NASCAR Nationwide Series|2008]], Sauter returned to the team, but was released after five races. After Sterling Marlin drove one race, Mike Bliss was named the permanent driver of the No. 1 car.  Marc Reno, who was born in California and currently resides in Concord, NC, serves as the crew chief and manages the team. He returned to the car after a solid season in 2008 for a full 2009 campaign. On May 23, 2009, [[Mike Bliss]] scored his second career Nationwide win and eleventh win for the team at [[Lowe's Motor Speedway]] by taking advantage of fuel mileage and a race-ending caution near the end of the race because of rain. In August 2009, Bliss was released due to conflicts with crew chief [[Marc Reno]]. [[Ryan Newman (racing driver)|Ryan Newman]], [[Reed Sorenson]], [[Max Papis]], [[Martin Truex, Jr.]], [[David Gilliland]], and [[Landon Cassill]] also took turns sharing the ride following Bliss' release. Rookie [[James Buescher]] was to drive the car full-time in 2010, but Finch put his entire operation up for sale on April 24. On May 12, 2010, Buescher parted ways with Phoenix Racing, [[Ryan Newman (racing driver)|Ryan Newman]] will drive at Dover.\n\nOn July 6, 2012, Phoenix recorded its first Nationwide Series win in three years when [[Kurt Busch]], who would make occasional starts for the team that season, won the [[Subway Jalapeno 250]] at Daytona for his fifth win in the series and his first for another team owner besides [[Roger Penske]] and [[Kyle Busch]].\n\nThe No. 1 has 13 victories.\n\n=== Car No. 4 history ===\nPhoenix Racing began running two cars in [[2000 NASCAR Busch Series|2000]], when [[Matt Hutter]] drove the No. 51 at Daytona and Talladega, with [[Tracfone]] sponsoring; his best finish was 19th. LaJoie drove late in the season at Homestead, when P. J. Jones drove the No. 1. In [[2005 NASCAR Busch Series|2005]], they began fielding the No. 09 for three races, with Boris Said, Wallace, and [[Eric McClure]] driving. They began fielding the second car full-time in [[2007 NASCAR Busch Series|2007]], when Wallace drove the No. 7 [[GEICO]] Chevrolet. Despite failing to finish in the top-ten, he finished 11th in points. In [[2008 NASCAR Nationwide Series|2008]], the team switched to the No. 4, and leased its owners points to [[Jay Robinson Racing]]. Robinson ran the No. 4 car on a full-time basis, although Phoenix did field the No. 4 for [[Landon Cassill]] at Mexico City.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{Racing-Reference owner|James_Finch|James Finch}}\n\n{{HScott Motorsports}}\n{{Billy Ballew Motorsports}}\n{{Wauters Motorsports}}\n{{NASCAR Truck Series teams}}\n{{Toyota in NASCAR}}\n\n[[Category:American auto racing teams]]\n[[Category:ARCA Menards Series teams]]\n[[Category:Companies based in South Carolina]]\n[[Category:Defunct NASCAR teams]]\n[[Category:Auto racing teams established in 1989]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Defunct American racing team}}\n{{for|the GT and touring car team|Phoenix Racing (Germany)}}\n{{refimprove|date=November 2019}}\n{{Infobox NASCAR team\n| Team_name      = Phoenix Racing\n| Logo           = \n| Owner_names    = [[James Finch]]\n| Base           = \n| Series         = [[Sprint Cup Series]]<br>[[Nationwide Series]]\n| Numbers        = 09, 1, 4, 7, 22, 23, 28, 37, 50, 51\n| Drivers        = \n| Sponsors       = \n| Manufacturer   = [[Chevrolet]]<br>[[Ford]]<br>[[Dodge]]<br>[[Oldsmobile]]\n| Opened         = [[1990 in NASCAR|1990]]\n| Closed           = [[2013 in NASCAR|2013]]\n| Debut          = '''Sprint Cup Series''':<br>[[1990 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|1990]] [[1990 Peak AntiFreeze 500|Peak AntiFreeze 500]] ([[Dover International Speedway|Dover]]) <br> '''Nationwide Series''':<br>[[1989 NASCAR Busch Series|1989]] [[All Pro 300]] ([[Charlotte Motor Speedway|Charlotte]]) <br> '''Craftsman Truck Series''':<br> [[2004 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series|2004]] [[Cheerios Betty Crocker 200|Kroger 200]] ([[Richmond Raceway|Richmond]])\n| Final          = '''Sprint Cup Series''':<br>[[2013 AdvoCare 500 (Atlanta)|2013 Advocare 500]] ([[Atlanta Motor Speedway|Atlanta]]) <br> '''Nationwide Series''':<br> [[2013 NASCAR Nationwide Series|2013]] [[Subway Firecracker 250]] ([[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]]\n| Races          = '''Total''': 859<br>'''Sprint Cup Series''': 251<br>'''Nationwide Series''': 543<br>'''Craftsman Truck Series''': 1<br>'''ARCA Racing Series''': 64\n| Drivers_champ  = 0\n| Wins           = '''Total''': 24<br>'''Sprint Cup Series''': 1<br>'''Nationwide Series''': 13<br>'''Craftsman Truck Series''': 0<br>'''ARCA Racing Series''': 10\n| Poles          = '''Total''': 18<br>'''Sprint Cup Series''': 0<br>'''Nationwide Series''': 10<br>'''Craftsman Truck Series''': 0<br>'''ARCA Racing Series''': 8\n}}\n\n'''Phoenix Racing''' is a former motorsports team that competed in the [[NASCAR]] [[Sprint Cup Series]] and the [[Nationwide Series]]. Owned by Florida businessman [[James Finch]], the team fielded entries from 1990 through 2013. The team fielded a wide variety of drivers and often changed manufacturers, though it often maintained a relationship with [[Hendrick Motorsports]]. In Sprint Cup, Phoenix Racing was victorious just once in 251 starts over 24 seasons.\n\nThe team was sold to Harry Scott, Jr. in September 2013, later renamed [[HScott Motorsports]].\n\n==Sprint Cup Series==\n===Car No. 51 history===\n====Early days====\nPhoenix Racing began racing in the Cup Series in [[1990 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|1990]], when it fielded the No. 51 [[Valspar|Plasti-Kote]] [[Chevrolet Lumina]] for [[Jeff Purvis]]. In four races, Purvis failed to finish a race, his best finishing being a 31st at [[North Wilkesboro Speedway]]. Phoenix attempted to run a full schedule in [[1991 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|1991]], but soon cut back to a part-time schedule, completing six races in total. Due to a lack of funding, the team only ran two races in [[1992 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|1992]], with Finch's company [[Phoenix Construction]] of [[Panama City, Florida]], serving as sponsor. In [[1993 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|1993]], the team ran all of the restrictor plate races on the schedule, except for the [[Daytona 500]], for which they failed to qualify. For [[1994 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|1994]], they picked up sponsorship from [[Country Time]] and had planned to run a limited schedule with [[Neil Bonnett]] driving. Bonnett was killed in a practice crash at Daytona before the [[1994 Daytona 500]], and Purvis was brought back to drive the car. In six races, his best finish was 21st. Phoenix changed its number to 44 in [[1995 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|1995]], and ran six more races with Purvis and [[Jackaroo Sauce]], only finishing one race. [[MCA Records]] became the new sponsor for [[1996 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|1996]], and the team had two top-ten qualification starts, but could not finish higher than twelfth.\n\n====2000s: Part-time and Talladega win====\nAfter staying out of Cup for several years, Finch purchased a number of [[Ford Taurus]]es from [[Bill Elliott Racing]], and ran all of the [[2001 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|2001]] schedule's restrictor plate races with Purvis driving the No. 51, only finishing one race. In [[2002 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|2002]], the team picked up funding from [[Miccosukee]] and switched to the No. 09. Driver Geoffrey Bodine had a third-place finish in the Daytona 500, and later had a 2nd-place qualification at the [[Pepsi 400]]. [[Mike Wallace (racing driver)|Mike Wallace]] ran a limited schedule for Phoenix in [[2003 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|2003]], and had two top-ten finishes. [[Scott Pruett]] and [[Buckshot Jones]] also ran one race deals for the team that season, during which they switched to [[Dodge]]. The team began [[2004 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series|2004]] with [[Joe Ruttman]] and [[Johnny Benson]] sharing the ride.  The idea was that Benson, who was also driving the team's Busch Series car, would run full races and Ruttman would [[start and park]] when he started. This drew criticism in the [[2004 Subway 400|Subway 400]], the second race of the season, at Rockingham when Ruttman entered with no pit crew, was parked by NASCAR after one lap, and collected $54,196 for a last-place finish.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fryer|first=Jenna|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/news/story?id=1743378|title=NASCAR calls Ruttman run 'a sham'|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=February 24, 2004|accessdate=January 25, 2014}}</ref> The team later said they would be \"legitimate racing\" after the incident and both Benson and Ruttman were eventually fired. [[Bobby Hamilton, Jr.]] then drove for six races during the middle of the season, before Wallace and [[Johnny Sauter]] returned to run the tail part of the season. Pruett and [[Tony Raines]], also ran in one-off attempts in the car. Sauter drove ten races in the No. 09 in [[2005 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series|2005]], and had a ninth-place finish at [[Phoenix International Raceway]]. Late in the season, [[Bobby Hamilton]] and [[Reed Sorenson]] drove the 09 at Martinsville and Homestead, respectively.\n\nBeginning in [[2006 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series|2006]], Phoenix abbreviated the 09's schedule even further, switching back and forth between Dodge and [[Ford]]. Mike Wallace ran just three races and failed to finish higher than seventeenth. Mayfield ran the season-ending [[Ford 400]], but did not finish due to an oil leak. Wallace had a fourth-place finish in the [[2007 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series|2007]] [[Daytona 500]], but the team did not qualify for another race until the final two races of the year, when Sterling Marlin drove. For [[2008 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series|2008]], Marlin ran 10\u201312 races for Phoenix.\n[[File:Sterling Marlin 2008 Miccosukee Chevy Impala.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The No. 09 car]]\nPhoenix Racing announced for 2009 that they would be running two different makes of cars for the upcoming Sprint Cup season. The No. 09 was shared by Marlin, Phoenix's Nationwide Series driver [[Mike Bliss]], and [[Brad Keselowski]], who at the time was a developmental driver for [[Hendrick Motorsports]]. [[Ron Fellows]] also ran as a road course ringer. The team fielded purchased Ganassi Dodges for Marlin and Bliss, and purchased Hendrick Chevrolets for Keselowski and Fellows.\n\nAfter 19 years in the Cup Series Phoenix Racing finally won its first race, taking the [[2009 Aaron's 499|Aaron's 499]] with Keselowski behind the wheel. Keselowski turned [[Carl Edwards]] when Edwards attempted a second block on Keselowski's passing move, but Keselowski held his ground as Edwards wrecked and drove to the finish to lead his only lap of the day and win the race.\n\n====2010s: full-time and sale====\nFormer [[Earnhardt Ganassi Racing]] driver [[Aric Almirola]] was hired to drive for the team in 2010. The team's competitiveness was put into question when it lost its longtime sponsor [[Miccosukee]] at the beginning of the season. Almirola failed to qualify three of the first seven events, including the Daytona 500, and [[start and park]]ed in its four starts due to lack of funds. Almirola left the team after the race at Phoenix to focus on his Truck Series efforts,<ref name=Bleacher-Finch-Almirola-2010>{{cite web|last1=Fan|first1=Horn|title=Aric Almirola's Sole Focus Is Now Camping World Truck Series|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/378554-aric-almirola-his-sole-focus-now-is-on-the-camping-world-truck-series|website=[[Bleacher Report]]|publisher=[[Bleacher Report]]|accessdate=November 26, 2014|date=April 14, 2010}}</ref> and was replaced by Mike Bliss and a handful of other drivers, including ([[Xfinity Series]] driver) [[Landon Cassill]], (Former [[F1]] driver) [[Jan Magnussen]], and ([[2000 NASCAR Winston Cup Series]] champion) [[Bobby Labonte]]. Phoenix Racing returned in 2011 despite rumors that Finch had been trying to sell the team. [[Bill Elliott]] drove the first 4 races before [[Landon Cassill]] took over the ride with sponsorship from [[Security Benefit]].

They ran four races together the following season in the No. 15 car, but had three engine failures. The next season, Phoenix and Purvis ran four consecutive races in the No. 14/23 [[Seal-Tech]] Buick, with a best finish of seventeenth. After a seventh-place finish at Talladega in [[1992 NASCAR Busch Series|1992]], the team ran as the No. 28 [[Havoline]] Ford for three races, and then changed to the No. 4 [[Kodak Funsaver Camera]] Chevrolet in [[1993 NASCAR Busch Series|1993]]. Purvis won his first pole at Talladega in [[1994 NASCAR Busch Series|1994]] as the No. 51 Country Time car, then switched back to the No. 4 Kodak car the next year, where he had three top-ten finishes.\n\nPhoenix Racing made its first full-time season in [[1996 NASCAR Busch Series|1996]], despite the No. 4 not having major sponsorship. Purvis won two races and a pole position, finishing seventh in points. Purvis ran the first four races of the [[1997 NASCAR Busch Series|1997]], and had a top-ten finish, but was replaced by [[Tim Steele (racing driver)|Tim Steele]], who brought sponsorship from [[HS Die]]. He had two top-tens, but injuries forced him to exit the ride. He was replaced by multiple drivers, with [[Dale Shaw]] running a majority of the races that season, including a 2nd-place finish at [[South Boston Speedway]]. Sterling Marlin, [[Ernie Irvan]], and [[Ron Fellows]] filled in for Shaw when he could not run. [[Kevin Lepage]] then drove two races near the end of the season, before Purvis returned to drive the last race of the year. In [[1998 NASCAR Busch Series|1998]], Purvis was again named full-time driver, with [[Lance Snacks]] sponsoring. Purvis made 26 starts, missing one race due to injury, during which he was replaced by [[Dennis Setzer]], and an additional four races during which he was suspended for rough driving. [[Nathan Buttke]] and [[Matt Hutter]] took his place for those races.\n\nPurvis and Lance Snacks departed for [[Joe Gibbs Racing|Bechtel/Gibbs Racing]] at the end of the year, taking the No. 4 with him. Phoenix Racing switched to the No. 1 and hired [[Randy LaJoie]] to drive. They did not have major sponsorship of start the season, and signed a one-race deal with [[Jani-King]] before winning the season-opening [[NAPA Auto Parts 300]]. [[Bob Evans Restaurants]] then became the sponsor, and LaJoie finished tenth in points. He followed that up with a victory at [[Nashville Speedway|USA]] and a seventh-place finish in points in [[2000 NASCAR Busch Series|2000]]. [[P. J. Jones]] was named driver of the No. 1 for [[2001 NASCAR Busch Series|2001]], bringing [[Yellow Freight]] sponsorship. After four races, he was replaced by [[Jimmy Spencer]] who drove in eighteen races for Phoenix, winning three races. Bobby Hamilton, Lepage, and Joe Ruttman filled in for Spencer on occasion. \n\nPhoenix dropped to a part-time schedule in [[2002 NASCAR Busch Series|2002]], with Spencer winning twice in 23 races, and Ruttman and [[Martin Truex, Jr.]] running one race apiece. In [[2003 NASCAR Busch Series|2003]], they formed a partnership with [[Chip Ganassi Racing]] and fielded the No. 1 full-time for two Ganassi drivers: Cup series driver Jamie McMurray and developmental driver [[David Stremme]]. McMurray had two wins, both at [[Rockingham Speedway|Rockingham]], while Stremme made sixteen starts with two top-fives, earning him Rookie of the Year honors.\n\n[[Johnny Benson]] was named full-time driver in [[2004 NASCAR Busch Series|2004]], with Miccosukee Resorts being named the new sponsor. He won one pole and had four top-tens when he was released after ten starts. McMurray ran three of the next four races, and Purvis returned for one race at [[Nazareth Speedway]]. Buckshot Jones drove the next two races with the return of Yellow Transportation to the team, followed by [[Tony Raines]], [[Casey Mears]], Bobby Hamilton, Sterling Marlin, Reed Sorenson, and [[Regan Smith]]. \n\n[[Johnny Sauter]] was named the permanent driver of the No. 1 in [[2005 NASCAR Busch Series|2005]], winning at Milwaukee and finishing twelfth in points after [[Boris Said]] took his place at the Mexico race. Sauter left for [[Stewart-Haas Racing|Haas CNC Racing]] and took the sponsorship with him, and [[Jason Keller]] was hired to drive. After eight races, Keller was released and replaced by Mike Wallace, who garnered two top-five finishes, with [[Scott Pruett]] and development driver [[Cale Gale]] filling in. For [[2007 NASCAR Busch Series|2007]], [[J. J. Yeley]] was named the new driver of the No. 1, but struggled and only had one top-ten finish and missed six races, with Benson, Marlin and Max Papis filling for most of those races.\n\nIn [[2008 NASCAR Nationwide Series|2008]], Sauter returned to the team, but was released after five races. After Sterling Marlin drove one race, Mike Bliss was named the permanent driver of the No. 1 car.  Marc Reno, who was born in California and currently resides in Concord, NC, serves as the crew chief and manages the team. He returned to the car after a solid season in 2008 for a full 2009 campaign. On May 23, 2009, [[Mike Bliss]] scored his second career Nationwide win and eleventh win for the team at [[Lowe's Motor Speedway]] by taking advantage of fuel mileage and a race-ending caution near the end of the race because of rain. In August 2009, Bliss was released due to conflicts with crew chief [[Marc Reno]]. [[Ryan Newman (racing driver)|Ryan Newman]], [[Reed Sorenson]], [[Max Papis]], [[Martin Truex, Jr.]], [[David Gilliland]], and [[Landon Cassill]] also took turns sharing the ride following Bliss' release. Rookie [[James Buescher]] was to drive the car full-time in 2010, but Finch put his entire operation up for sale on April 24. On May 12, 2010, Buescher parted ways with Phoenix Racing, [[Ryan Newman (racing driver)|Ryan Newman]] will drive at Dover.\n\nOn July 6, 2012, Phoenix recorded its first Nationwide Series win in three years when [[Kurt Busch]], who would make occasional starts for the team that season, won the [[Subway Jalapeno 250]] at Daytona for his fifth win in the series and his first for another team owner besides [[Roger Penske]] and [[Kyle Busch]].\n\nThe No. 1 has 13 victories.\n\n=== Car No. 4 history ===\nPhoenix Racing began running two cars in [[2000 NASCAR Busch Series|2000]], when [[Matt Hutter]] drove the No. 51 at Daytona and Talladega, with [[Tracfone]] sponsoring; his best finish was 19th. LaJoie drove late in the season at Homestead, when P. J. Jones drove the No. 1. In [[2005 NASCAR Busch Series|2005]], they began fielding the No. 09 for three races, with Boris Said, Wallace, and [[Eric McClure]] driving. They began fielding the second car full-time in [[2007 NASCAR Busch Series|2007]], when Wallace drove the No. 7 [[GEICO]] Chevrolet. Despite failing to finish in the top-ten, he finished 11th in points. In [[2008 NASCAR Nationwide Series|2008]], the team switched to the No. 4, and leased its owners points to [[Jay Robinson Racing]]. Robinson ran the No. 4 car on a full-time basis, although Phoenix did field the No. 4 for [[Landon Cassill]] at Mexico City.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{Racing-Reference owner|James_Finch|James Finch}}\n\n{{HScott Motorsports}}\n{{Billy Ballew Motorsports}}\n{{Wauters Motorsports}}\n{{NASCAR Truck Series teams}}\n{{Toyota in NASCAR}}\n\n[[Category:American auto racing teams]]\n[[Category:ARCA Menards Series teams]]\n[[Category:Companies based in South Carolina]]\n[[Category:Defunct NASCAR teams]]\n[[Category:Auto racing teams established in 1989]]\n", "name_user": "TramcarCS", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Racing_(NASCAR_team)"}

On 8 November, the Czechoslovak Army crossed the northern borders, and on 13 November, the Romanian army crossed the eastern borders of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]].

This led to Hungary being totally defenseless.\n\nDuring the rule of K\u00e1rolyi's pacifist cabinet, Hungary lost the control over approx. 75% of its former pre-WW1 territories (325 411&nbsp;km\u00b2) without fight and was subject to foreign occupation.\n\n==Minister without portfolio==\nCriticised for his dilettantism, he resigned as Secretary of War on 9 November, but he kept his membership in the government. His task was to lead the negotiations for the preparations of the [[Treaty of Trianon|peace treaty]].\n\nOn 7 November there were already negotiations in [[Belgrade]] between the delegation led by [[Mih\u00e1ly K\u00e1rolyi]] and the commander of eastern Entente troops, general [[Franchet d'Esperey]]. On 13 November, Linder signed the [[Armistice of Belgrade]] together with General Henrys (commander of French Eastern Army) and [[voivode]] [[\u017divojin Mi\u0161i\u0107]] (commander general of the Serb army).\n\nDuring the period of the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]], he was engaged in numerous diplomatic moves as the [[military attach\u00e9]] of the Ministry of Military in [[Vienna]] (2 May \u2013 5 August 1919).\n\n==Activities in Baranya, fleeing abroad==\nAfter the collapse of the Hungarian Soviet Republic, he joined the Socialist Party, and on 23 September 1920 he became the mayor of [[P\u00e9cs]].

On 5 November 1918, the Serbian army, with the help of the French army, crossed southern borders. On 8 November, the Czechoslovak Army crossed the northern borders, and on 13 November, the Romanian army crossed the eastern borders of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]].

Because of the free and open-source nature of the software, users can extend the functionality of the software using the [[Python (programming language)|Python]] programming language. FreeCAD is currently in a [[beta (software)|beta]] stage of development.\n\n==Features==\n\n===General===\nFreeCAD features tools similar to [[CATIA]], [[Creo (design software)|Creo]], [[SolidWorks]], [[Solid Edge]], [[Siemens NX|NX]], [[Autodesk Inventor|Inventor]], [[Autodesk Revit|Revit]], and therefore also falls into the category of [[Building Information Modeling|Building Info Modeling]] (BIM), Mechanical computer-aided design (MCAD), [[Product lifecycle management|PLM]], CAx and [[Computer-aided engineering|CAE]]. It is intended to be a feature-based [[Solid modeling#Parametric modeling|parametric modeler]] with a modular software architecture, which makes it easy to provide additional functionality without modifying the core system.\n\nAs with many modern 3D CAD modelers, it will have a 2D component to facilitate 3D-to-2D drawing conversion. Under its current state, direct 2D drawing (like [[AutoCAD#AutoCAD LT|AutoCAD LT]]) is not the focus for this software, neither are animation or 3D model manipulation (like [[Blender (software)|Blender]], [[Autodesk Maya|Maya]], or [[Cinema 4D]]). However, the modular nature of FreeCAD will allow the user to adapt its workflow for such environments.\n\nFreeCAD uses open-source libraries from the field of [[scientific computing|computing science]]; among them are [[Open CASCADE]] (a [[CAD kernel]]), [[Coin3D]] (an incarnation of [[Open Inventor]]), the [[Qt (framework)|Qt]] GUI framework, and [[Python (programming language)|Python]], a popular scripting language.

Because of the free and open-source nature of the software, users can extend the functionality of the software using the [[Python (programming language)|Python]] programming language. FreeCAD is currently in a [[Beta (software)|beta]] stage of development.\n\n==Features==\n\n===General===\nFreeCAD features tools similar to [[CATIA]], [[Creo (design software)|Creo]], [[SolidWorks]], [[Solid Edge]], [[Siemens NX|NX]], [[Autodesk Inventor|Inventor]], [[Autodesk Revit|Revit]], and therefore also falls into the category of [[Building Information Modeling|Building Info Modeling]] (BIM), Mechanical computer-aided design (MCAD), [[Product lifecycle management|PLM]], CAx and [[Computer-aided engineering|CAE]]. It is intended to be a feature-based [[Solid modeling#Parametric modeling|parametric modeler]] with a modular software architecture, which makes it easy to provide additional functionality without modifying the core system.\n\nAs with many modern 3D CAD modelers, it will have a 2D component to facilitate 3D-to-2D drawing conversion. Under its current state, direct 2D drawing (like [[AutoCAD#AutoCAD LT|AutoCAD LT]]) is not the focus for this software, neither are animation or 3D model manipulation (like [[Blender (software)|Blender]], [[Autodesk Maya|Maya]], or [[Cinema 4D]]). However, the modular nature of FreeCAD will allow the user to adapt its workflow for such environments.\n\nFreeCAD uses open-source libraries from the field of [[scientific computing|computing science]]; among them are [[Open CASCADE]] (a [[CAD kernel]]), [[Coin3D]] (an incarnation of [[Open Inventor]]), the [[Qt (framework)|Qt]] GUI framework, and [[Python (programming language)|Python]], a popular scripting language. FreeCAD itself can also be used as a library by other programs.<ref name=fossmint> {{cite web | url = https://www.fossmint.com/freecad-3d-modeling-and-design-software-for-linux/ | first = Martins | last = Okoi | date = December 1, 2017 | access-date = May 2, 2019 | publisher = FOSSMint | title = FreeCAD \u2013 A 3D Modeling and Design Software for Linux }} \n </ref> \n\nThere are moves to expand FreeCAD in the [[architecture]], [[Electrical engineering|electrical]], and [[construction]] (AEC) [[engineering]] sectors and to add [[building information modeling]] (BIM) functionality with the Arch Module.<ref>{{cite web |title=Arch Module |url=https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/Arch_Module |publisher=FreeCAD wiki |accessdate=15 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Supported file formats===\nFreeCAD's own main file format is '''FreeCAD Standard file format''' (.FCStd).<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|title = File Format FCStd - FreeCAD Documentation|url = https://freecadweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=File_Format_FCStd|website = freecadweb.org|accessdate = 2015-09-03}}</ref> It is a standard zip file that holds files in a certain structure.<ref name=\":0\" /> Document.[[xml]] file has all geometric and parametric objects definitions.<ref name=\":0\" /> GuiDocument.xml then has visual representation details of objects.<ref name=\":0\" /> Other files include brep-files for objects and thumbnail of drawing.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBesides FreeCAD's own file format, files can be exported and imported in the following file formats: [[DXF]], [[SVG|SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)]], [[ISO 10303|STEP]], [[IGES]], [[STL (file format)|STL (STereoLithography)]], [[Wavefront .obj file|OBJ (Wavefront)]], [[COLLADA|DAE (Collada)]], [[OpenSCAD|SCAD (OpenSCAD)]], [[Autodesk Inventor|IV (Inventor)]] and [[Industry Foundation Classes|IFC]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Feature list|url=https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Feature_list|publisher=FreeCAD wiki|accessdate=15 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n====DWG support====\nFreeCAD's support for the important [[.dwg|DWG]] file format has been problematic due to [[software license]] compatibility problems with the [[GNU LibreDWG]] library.

The team has won the Elite 1 championship twice in the NASCAR Whelen Euro Series as well as winning the team championship five times in the defunct [[Superstars Series]]. The team currently fields the No. 27 team for Thomas Ferrando and Pierluigi Veronesi, the No. 31 team for Mauro Trione and Advait Deodhar, and the No. 54 team for [[Alon Day]] and Arianna Casoli.\n\n==History==\n\n===Superstars Series===\nCAAL Racing has been active in the [[Superstars Series]] since its inaugural season in [[2004 Superstars Series|2004]]. The team fielded [[Francesco Ascani]] in a [[BMW M5 E39]]. The Italian driver won races at [[Autodromo Riccardo Paletti|Varano]] and [[Autodromo Nazionale di Monza|Monza]]. Ascani won the inaugural season of the start up series beating the only other full time driver, [[Mauro Simoncini]], by 14 points. The following season the team, as well as the series, expanded. Ascani was retained by the team and two part-time drivers, [[Leonardo Baccarelli]] and [[Albert Colajanni]] joined the line-up. Ascani won the opening race at [[Adria International Raceway|Adria]] and the team scored three more podium finishes clinching the team championship again.\n\nIn 2006 the team was beaten by [[Audi Sport Italia]] for the teams championship. [[Marco Gregori]] was the team's best driver placing fourth in the series championship. Ascani raced a new [[BMW 550i E60]]. The team continued to enter the BMW M5 E39 alongside the BMW 550i E60 in 2007. The team entered eleven different drivers in its three cars during the season. Only [[Giuliano Alessi]] raced all rounds scoring four podium finishes in the overall championship. The Italian won the International Superstars Series winning at Adria and [[ACI Vallelunga Circuit|Vallelunga]]. CAAL Racing driver [[Stefano Gabellini]] was very successful in 2008 winning two races in the overall championship. He finished second in the series standings, behind [[Gianni Morbidelli]]. Gabellini won the International Superstars Series. Gabellini again finished second in the overall series in 2009.\n\nFor 2010 the team switched from the BMW to the [[Mercedes-Benz C-Class|Mercedes C63 AMG]]. CAAL Racing driver [[Luigi Ferrara]] won both opening races at Monza. Scoring five more podium finishes Ferrara finished third in the series standings. Ferrari also finished third in the series championship in 2011 winning one race, at [[Misano World Circuit Marco Simoncelli|Misano]]. For 2012 [[Vitantonio Liuzzi]] was the series only full time driver. The team also received factory support from [[Mercedes-AMG]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Superstar Series: AMG officieel partner CAAL Racing|url=http://autosport.nl/klasse/nieuws/17433/amg-officieel-partner-caal-racing|website=Autosport.nl|accessdate=12 January 2017}}</ref> Liuzzi was the best Mercedes driver finishing second in the series championship. The former Formula 1 driver won at Monza and the [[Hungaroring]].\n\nThe 2013 season was the last Superstars Series season in its original form. Liuzzi left the team to join [[Mercedes-AMG Romeo Ferraris|Romeo Ferraris]]. None of the four teams drivers competed all the rounds, nor achieved major results. Financial reasons caused the series to reform as the EuroV8 Series for 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=Superstars: Superstars ter ziele.

Cheever won races at [[Brands Hatch]], [[Autodromo dell'Umbria|Magione]] and the season finale at Le Mans. The Italian-American finished third in the Elite 1 series standings. Cheever remained for 2015 winning the season opener at [[Circuit Ricardo Tormo|Valencia]]. In the course of the season Cheever was surpassed by series newcomer [[Alon Day]]. Day won at Magione and both races at [[Circuit Zolder|Zolder]]. The third car was manned by [[Nicol\u00f2 Rocca]] who won at [[Raceway Venray|Venray]], [[Tours Speedway|Tours]] and Magione. Despite the team winning seven out of twelve races, the series championship was won by [[Ander Vilari\u00f1o]] with [[TFT Racing]]. Day was the best placed driver in the championship finishing second. The 2016 season was less successful with only Day remaining with the team, again winning three races. Day won races at Valencia, Brands Hatch and [[Adria International Raceway|Adria]]. As he struggled on the ovals at Venray and Tours, taking only one top five finish, Day finished third in the championship standings.\n\nFor the 2019 season, the team initially fielded two cars: The No. 31 team driven by Mauro Trione and Meisam Taheri, and the No. 54 team driven by [[Alon Day]] and Arianna Casoli.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alon Day leads CAAL Racing\u2019s lineup to chase history|url=https://www.euronascar.com/2019/03/27/heres-a-test-article-alon-day-leads-caal-racings-lineup-to-chase-history/|website=euronascar.com|publisher=NASCAR Media Group, LLC.|accessdate=25 July 2019}}</ref> Moreno di Silvestre would later replaced Taheri at [[Autodromo di Franciacorta|Franciacorta]] before Advait Deodhar took over the seat starting from [[Brands Hatch]].

The team has won the Elite 1 championship twice in the NASCAR Whelen Euro Series as well as winning the team championship five times in the defunct [[Superstars Series]]. The team currently fields the No. 27 team for Thomas Ferrando and Pierluigi Veronesi, the No. 31 team for Mauro Trione and Advait Deodhar, and the No. 54 team for [[Alon Day]] and Arianna Casoli.\n\n==History==\n\n===Superstars Series===\nCAAL Racing has been active in the [[Superstars Series]] since its inaugural season in [[2004 Superstars Series|2004]]. The team fielded [[Francesco Ascani]] in a [[BMW M5 E39]]. The Italian driver won races at [[Autodromo Riccardo Paletti|Varano]] and [[Autodromo Nazionale di Monza|Monza]]. Ascani won the inaugural season of the start up series beating the only other full time driver, [[Mauro Simoncini]], by 14 points. The following season the team, as well as the series, expanded. Ascani was retained by the team and two part-time drivers, [[Leonardo Baccarelli]] and [[Albert Colajanni]] joined the line-up. Ascani won the opening race at [[Adria International Raceway|Adria]] and the team scored three more podium finishes clinching the team championship again.\n\nIn 2006 the team was beaten by [[Audi Sport Italia]] for the teams championship. [[Marco Gregori]] was the teams best driver placing fourth in the series championship. Ascani raced a new [[BMW 550i E60]]. The team continued to enter the BMW M5 E39 alongside the BMW 550i E60 in 2007. The team entered eleven different drivers in its three cars during the season. Only [[Giuliano Alessi]] raced all rounds scoring four podium finishes in the overall championship. The Italian won the International Superstars Series winning at Adria and [[ACI Vallelunga Circuit|Vallelunga]]. CAAL Racing driver [[Stefano Gabellini]] was very successful in 2008 winning two races in the overall championship. He finished second in the series standings, behind [[Gianni Morbidelli]]. Gabellini won the International Superstars Series. Gabellini again finished second in the overall series in 2009.\n\nFor 2010 the team switched from the BMW to the [[Mercedes-Benz C-Class|Mercedes C63 AMG]]. CAAL Racing driver [[Luigi Ferrara]] won both opening races at Monza. Scoring five more podium finishes Ferrara finished third in the series standings. Ferrari also finished third in the series championship in 2011 winning one race, at [[Misano World Circuit Marco Simoncelli|Misano]]. For 2012 [[Vitantonio Liuzzi]] was the series only full time driver. The team also received factory support from [[Mercedes-AMG]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Superstar Series: AMG officieel partner CAAL Racing|url=http://autosport.nl/klasse/nieuws/17433/amg-officieel-partner-caal-racing|website=Autosport.nl|accessdate=12 January 2017}}</ref> Liuzzi was the best Mercedes driver finishing second in the series championship. The former Formula 1 driver won at Monza and the [[Hungaroring]].\n\nThe 2013 season was the last Superstars Series season in its original form. Liuzzi left the team to join [[Mercedes-AMG Romeo Ferraris|Romeo Ferraris]]. None of the four teams drivers competed all the rounds, nor achieved major results. Financial reasons caused the series to reform as the EuroV8 Series for 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=Superstars: Superstars ter ziele.

Cheever won races at [[Brands Hatch]], [[Autodromo dell'Umbria|Magione]] and the season finale at Le Mans. The Italian-American finished third in the Elite 1 series standings. Cheever remained for 2015 winning the season opener at [[Circuit Ricardo Tormo|Valencia]]. In the course of the season Cheever was surpassed by series newcomer [[Alon Day]]. Day won at Magione and both races at [[Circuit Zolder|Zolder]]. The third car was manned by [[Nicol\u00f2 Rocca]] who won at [[Raceway Venray|Venray]], [[Tours Speedway|Tours]] and Magione. Despite the team winning seven out of twelve races, the series championship was won by [[Ander Vilari\u00f1o]] with [[TFT Racing]]. Day was the best placed driver in the championship finishing second. The 2016 season was less successful with only Day remaining with the team, again winning three races. Day won races at Valencia, Brands Hatch and [[Adria International Raceway|Adria]].

In recent years, they have opened 54 brick and mortar stores to combat the strategies of other low-cost competitors in Chinese markets.

One day, I pointed out to their R&D boss, some inadequacies. After that, they merely acknowledged my input, but never acted upon what I had said. So I thought to myself, if I make a phone, you can tell me anything you wish for it or what's wrong. If it is justifiable, we will work on it immediately.
