A precursor to the School of Management, the Department of Industrial Administration, grew out of the [[Yale Labor and Management Center|Labor and Management Center]], and conferred the master in industrial administration from 1958 through 1973. Professors Thomas Holmes, [[Chris Argyris]], and David Votaw were instrumental in founding the MIA. In 1971, Yale University received a donation establishing a program in management from Frederick W. Beinecke, PhB 1909. Two years later, the Yale Corporation approved the establishment of a School of Organization and Management.{{Copyright violation|date=March 2017}} Arriving in 1976, the first class of the two-year program that awarded a master's degree in public and private management (MPPM) attended the campus on Hillhouse Avenue.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.yale.edu/printer/bulletin/pdffiles/som.pdf | page = 19 | title = School of Management 2016\u20132017 | publisher = BULLETIN OF YALE UNIVERSITY Series 112 Number 6 July 20, 2016 | accessdate = 25 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Yale School of Management, 135 Prospect Street.jpg|thumb|right|Founders Hall, the school's former main building]]\nHistorically known for its strength in studies regarding nonprofits and the public sector, the school's focus began to evolve and changed its name to the Yale School of Management in 1994.<ref name=\"yale.edu2\">{{cite web|url=http://som.yale.edu/our-approach/about-yale-som/history|title=History|website=Yale School of Management|accessdate=14 October 2017}}</ref> Shortly thereafter in 1999, the School began offering a master of business (MBA) degree and discontinued the MPPM degree.<ref name=\"yale.edu2\"/>\n\n[[File:Steinbach Hall 52 Hillhouse.JPG|thumb|right|[[Steinbach Hall]], a mansion formerly used by the school on [[Hillhouse Avenue]]]]\nYale SOM launched an executive MBA program for healthcare professionals in 2005, and in 2006 it introduced its mandatory, team-taught \"Integrated Curriculum\" for all MBA students.<ref name=\"yale.edu2\"/>\n\n[[File:Corridor inside Evans Hall.jpg|thumb|right|Evans Hall Corridor]]\n\nConcurrently in 2012, SOM launched the [[Global Network for Advanced Management]] and the Master of Advanced Management (MAM) program, a one-year program in advanced leadership and management courses, open to students who have earned or are earning an MBA or equivalent degree from Global Network for Advanced Management member schools.<ref name=\"yale.edu2\"/>\n\nIn 2014, Yale SOM enrolled its first class of students in an expanded MBA for Executives program, offering the Yale MBA integrated core along with advanced study in asset management, healthcare, or sustainability.
