Settlements of the [[Lenape]] were agriculturally based following [[Matrilineality|matrilineal]] lines. The protected lands nearby, Jockey Hollow, are what is remaining of the settlement.  Occupation changed with the seasons, the variable nature of the climate, and to preserve the fertility of the rich soil. Their fishing and hunting territories were wide-ranging and similarly divided among the three clans of the matrilineal [[culture]] in this Eastern Woodland environment. Trade with these native peoples for food and furs was conducted by the Dutch during the period of colonization of [[New Netherland]]. Although the European principle of land ownership was not recognized by the Lenape, [[Dutch West India Company]] policy required their colonists to purchase land that they settled, but typically, trading relationships were established in this area, rather than Dutch settlements.\n\nDuring the British colonial period, the earliest settlers of European descent arrived in this portion of the colony of New Jersey. Traditional native trails and pathways were followed as settlement began. Pressures upon the Lenape constantly drove them westward. About 1715 the village of ''Bottle Hill'' was established at the crossing of Ridgedale Avenue and Kings Road. Village governance principles followed the British model. The Luke Miller house at 105 Ridgedale Avenue is thought to be the oldest remaining home, having been built around 1730.<ref>Fillimon, Chris. [http://lukemillerhouse.com/majorlukemiller.htm \"Who was Luke Miller?\"], The Luke Miller House. Accessed August 13, 2013. \"The Luke Miller House (also referred to as Miller's Station) is considered the oldest existing home in Madison. It was built between 1730 and 1750, by Luke Miller's grandfather, Andrew Miller\"</ref> During British colonial rule, Kings Road was a toll road that assessed fees levied by the government appointed by the English king. Farther south was the ''Shunpike'', a road with a parallel path that was used deliberately by colonists to avoid the fees.<ref>[http://www.morrisplanning.org/survey/streethistories.pdf Morris County Street Histories], [[Morris County, New Jersey]] Planning & Development. Accessed August 13, 2013. \"The name 'Shunpike' is a contraction of the phrase 'Shun the Pike' meaning an alternate route to avoid payment on toll roads a.k.a. 'Pikes'.\"</ref>\n\nMorris County, created in 1739, was divided into three townships. The portion of the village north of Kings Road was put under the governance of [[Hanover Township, New Jersey|Hanover Township]] and the portion to the south, under the governance of [[Morris Township, New Jersey|Morris Township]]. A meeting house for the Presbyterian Church of South Hanover, as Madison was called at that time, was started in 1747 where the Presbyterian Cemetery still exists between Kings Road and Madison Avenue. With the [[Treaty of Easton]] in 1758, the Lenape were required to vacate their lands in colonial New Jersey and to move westward. Later, their leaders allied with the colonists during the [[American Revolutionary War]] in hopes of regaining former lands, but that was never realized.\n[[File:Presb Ch of Madison brick jeh.jpg|thumb|Presbyterian Church of Madison]]\n\nFollowing the revolution, changes to governing methods in the former colonies occurred eventually as the new nation organized herself. The state of New Jersey formed its government and debated best policies. During the reorganization of Morris County in 1806, [[Chatham Township, New Jersey|Chatham Township]] was established and included all of present-day Chatham Township, along with the three existing pre-Revolutionary War villages (the current municipalities of [[Chatham, New Jersey|Chatham]], [[Florham Park, New Jersey|Florham Park]], and Madison) as well as all of the lands still governed by the current [[Chatham Township, New Jersey|Chatham Township]], and thus the governmental division of Bottle Hill was ended.\n\nIn 1834, the name of the settlement was changed to Madison.<ref>Staff.

Protests of citizens who thought the original name intemperate occasioned the change in 1834.\"</ref>  As a tribute to the name every year there is a fair that is called Bottle Hill Day. On December 27, 1889, based on the results of a referendum passed on December 24, 1889, the village seceded from Chatham Township and adopted the newly created, borough form of government (when it first became available), in order to develop a local water supply system for its population of 3,250. Madison annexed additional portions of Chatham Township in 1891, and again each year from 1894 to 1898, which was followed by an exchange of certain lands in 1899 with Chatham Township.<ref name=Story>Snyder, John P.

Greenhouses dotted the countryside. Talented horticulturalists were attracted to the area for employment at the many wealthy estates in the immediate area and to establish related businesses. One of the first grand houses to be built on \"Millionaire's Row\" was the Ross Estate.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} In 1893, [[Florence Adele Vanderbilt Twombly|Florence Adele Vanderbilt]] and her husband [[Hamilton McKown Twombly]] began to built the impressive [[Florham]] estate.

The result with the cooperation of the D.L. & W.R.R. in the planning was completed in 1916. The tracks were elevated through the downtown and no established roadways were hindered by crossing delays.  Mrs. D. Willis James financed much of the road grading caused by the elevation of the tracks. The station included baggage and cargo facilities readily accessible by wagons as well as the stationmaster offices, a newsstand, and waiting facilities featuring extensive banks of high-backed wooden seating. Weeping Mulberry trees were planted among the landscaping and in natural areas in the parking area.\n\nThe rose industry and the large estates in the area attracted working-class people of all kinds. As a result, Madison developed a diverse population very early, both in terms of [[socioeconomic status]] and ethnic background. The original settlers were of [[English people|British]] stock; [[French people|French]] settlers came after the [[American Revolutionary War|American Revolution]]; [[African American]]s have been members of the community from early in the nineteenth century; [[Irish people|Irish]] came in the mid-nineteenth century; and then [[Germans]] and [[Italian people|Italians]] arrived around the turn of the twentieth century. To this day there is a substantial population of Italian descent in Madison. Today Madison also remains a diverse community, with many of the most recent newcomers arriving from Central America, South America, and Asia.

Settlements of the [[Lenape]] were agriculturally based following [[Matrilineality|matrilineal]] lines. The protected lands nearby, Jockey Hollow, are what is remaining of the settlement.  Occupation changed with the seasons, the variable nature of the climate, and to preserve the fertility of the rich soil. Their fishing and hunting territories were wide-ranging and similarly divided among the three clans of the matrilineal [[culture]] in this Eastern Woodland environment. Trade with these native peoples for food and furs was conducted by the Dutch during the period of colonization of [[New Netherland]]. Although the European principle of land ownership was not recognized by the Lenape, [[Dutch West India Company]] policy required their colonists to purchase land that they settled, but typically, trading relationships were established in this area, rather than Dutch settlements.\n\nDuring the British colonial period, the earliest settlers of European descent arrived in this portion of the colony of New Jersey. Traditional native trails and pathways were followed as settlement began. Pressures upon the Lenape constantly drove them westward. About 1715 the village of ''Bottle Hill'' was established at the crossing of Ridgedale Avenue and Kings Road. Village governance principles followed the British model. The Luke Miller house at 105 Ridgedale Avenue is thought to be the oldest remaining home, having been built around 1730.<ref>Fillimon, Chris.

It was built between 1730 and 1750, by Luke Miller's grandfather, Andrew Miller\"</ref> During British colonial rule, Kings Road was a toll road that assessed fees levied by the government appointed by the English king. Farther south was the ''Shunpike'', a road with a parallel path that was used deliberately by colonists to avoid the fees.<ref>[http://www.morrisplanning.org/survey/streethistories.pdf Morris County Street Histories], [[Morris County, New Jersey]] Planning & Development. Accessed August 13, 2013. \"The name 'Shunpike' is a contraction of the phrase 'Shun the Pike' meaning an alternate route to avoid payment on toll roads a.k.a. 'Pikes'.\"</ref>\n\nMorris County, created in 1739, was divided into three townships. The portion of the village north of Kings Road was put under the governance of [[Hanover Township, New Jersey|Hanover Township]] and the portion to the south, under the governance of [[Morris Township, New Jersey|Morris Township]]. A meeting house for the Presbyterian Church of South Hanover, as Madison was called at that time, was started in 1747 where the Presbyterian Cemetery still exists between Kings Road and Madison Avenue. With the [[Treaty of Easton]] in 1758, the Lenape were required to vacate their lands in colonial New Jersey and to move westward. Later, their leaders allied with the colonists during the [[American Revolutionary War]] in hopes of regaining former lands, but that was never realized.\n[[File:Presb Ch of Madison brick jeh.jpg|thumb|Presbyterian Church of Madison]]\n\nFollowing the revolution, changes to governing methods in the former colonies occurred eventually as the new nation organized herself. The state of New Jersey formed its government and debated best policies. During the reorganization of Morris County in 1806, [[Chatham Township, New Jersey|Chatham Township]] was established and included all of present-day Chatham Township, along with the three existing pre-Revolutionary War villages (the current municipalities of [[Chatham, New Jersey|Chatham]], [[Florham Park, New Jersey|Florham Park]], and Madison) as well as all of the lands still governed by the current [[Chatham Township, New Jersey|Chatham Township]], and thus the governmental division of Bottle Hill was ended.\n\nIn 1834, the name of the settlement was changed to Madison.<ref>Staff.

On December 27, 1889, based on the results of a referendum passed on December 24, 1889, the village seceded from Chatham Township and adopted the newly created, borough form of government (when it first became available), in order to develop a local water supply system for its population of 3,250. Madison annexed additional portions of Chatham Township in 1891, and again each year from 1894 to 1898, which was followed by an exchange of certain lands in 1899 with Chatham Township.<ref name=Story>Snyder, John P.

The tracks were elevated through the downtown and no established roadways were hindered by crossing delays.  Mrs. D.

The station included baggage and cargo facilities readily accessible by wagons as well as the stationmaster offices, a newsstand, and waiting facilities featuring extensive banks of high-backed wooden seating. Weeping Mulberry trees were planted among the landscaping and in natural areas in the parking area.\n\nThe rose industry and the large estates in the area attracted working-class people of all kinds. As a result, Madison developed a diverse population very early, both in terms of [[socioeconomic status]] and ethnic background. The original settlers were of [[English people|British]] stock; [[French people|French]] settlers came after the [[American Revolutionary War|American Revolution]]; [[African American]]s have been members of the community from early in the nineteenth century; [[Irish people|Irish]] came in the mid-nineteenth century; and then [[Germans]] and [[Italian people|Italians]] arrived around the turn of the twentieth century. To this day there is a substantial population of Italian descent in Madison. Today Madison also remains a diverse community, with many of the most recent newcomers arriving from Central America, South America, and Asia. Madison is a railroad suburb of New York City.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the borough had a total area of 4.218&nbsp;square miles (10.926&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), including 4.2057&nbsp;square miles (10.891&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of land and 0.013&nbsp;square miles (0.035&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of water (0.32%).<ref name=CensusArea/><ref name=\"GR1\" /><!--Do NOT use template to convert English into metric units for areas since the English and the metric units are reported directly from NJ Gazetteer citation source.--><!--Percentage calculated based on reported metric units from NJ Gazetteer citation source!--> Madison is located about {{convert|25|miles}} west of downtown Manhattan, and is a suburban town of New York City.<ref name=Thinking/>\n\nMadison borders the Morris County municipalities of [[Chatham Borough, New Jersey|Chatham Borough]] to the east, [[Chatham Township, New Jersey|Chatham Township]] to the south, [[Harding Township, New Jersey|Harding Township]] and [[Morris Township, New Jersey|Morris Township]] to the west and [[Florham Park, New Jersey|Florham Park]] to the north.<ref>[https://global.mapit.mysociety.org/area/1010532/touches.html Areas touching Madison], MapIt.
