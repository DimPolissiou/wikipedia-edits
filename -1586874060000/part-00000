Team song|Semicircle (album)}}[[File:Centre Avenue Bridges; New Rochelle, NY-2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Chain-link fencing showing the diamond patterning]]\n[[File:2015-05-07 06 05 45 A late spring heavy wet snowfall on back yards adjacent to 730 South 9th Street in Elko, Nevada.jpg|thumb]]\n\nA '''chain-link fence''' (also referred to as '''wire netting''', '''wire-mesh fence''', '''chain-wire fence''', '''cyclone fence''', '''hurricane fence''', or '''diamond-mesh fence''') is a type of [[woven]] [[fence]] usually made from [[Galvanization|galvanized]] or [[linear low-density polyethylene|LLDPE]]-coated [[steel]] wire.  The [[wire]]s run vertically and are bent into a zig-zag pattern so that each \"zig\" hooks with the wire immediately on one side and each \"zag\" with the wire immediately on the other.  This forms the characteristic [[Polyiamond|diamond]] pattern seen in this type of fence.\n\n==Development of chain-link fencing==\n[[File:Chain-link and barbed wire.jpg|thumb|right|A chain-link privacy fence topped with [[barbed tape|razor wire]] protecting a utility power substation.]]\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the firm of [[Barnard, Bishop & Barnard]] was established in [[Norwich]] to produce chain-link fencing by machine. The process was developed by Charles Barnard in 1844 based on cloth weaving machines (up until that time Norwich had a long history of cloth manufacture).<ref>Ward, Ken. [http://www.oldcity.org.uk/norwich/history/history08.php Victorian Norwich]. A History of Norwich, 28 November 2006, p. 6.</ref>\n\nThe Anchor Post Fence Co., established in 1891, bought the rights to the wire-weaving machine and was the first company to manufacture chain-link fencing in the United States. Anchor Fence also holds the first United States patent for chain-link. The machine was purchased from a man in 1845 from Belgium who originally invented the wire bending machine.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for this sentence which conflicts with the previous information|date=March 2017}}\n\n==Sizes and uses==\nIn the [[United States]], fencing usually comes in 20&nbsp;ft and 50&nbsp;ft rolls, which can be joined by \"unscrewing\" one of the end wires and then \"screwing\" it back in so that it hooks both pieces. Common heights include 3&nbsp;ft, 3&nbsp;ft 6 in, 4&nbsp;ft, 5&nbsp;ft, 6&nbsp;ft, 7&nbsp;ft, 8&nbsp;ft, 10&nbsp;ft, and 12&nbsp;ft, though almost any height is possible. Common mesh gauges are 9, 11, and 11.5. Mesh length can also vary based on need, with the standard diamond size being 2\". For tennis courts and ball parks, the most popular height is 10&nbsp;or 12 feet, and tennis courts use a diamond size of 1.75\" <ref>Long Fence {{cite web |url=http://www.longfence.com/commercial/fence/chain-link |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411062526/http://www.longfence.com/commercial/fence/chain-link |archivedate=2013-04-11 }}</ref> measured flat side to flat side.  Tennis courts often use this smaller diamond size so that power hitters won't be able to lodge the ball into a larger diamond size.\n\nThe popularity of chain-link fence is from its relatively low cost and that the open weave does not obscure sunlight from either side of the fence. One can make a chain-link fence semi-opaque by [[fence insert|inserting slats]] into the mesh.  Allowing ivy to grow and interweave itself is also popular.\n\n==Installation==\n\nThe installation of chain-link fence involves setting posts into the ground and attaching the fence to them.  The posts may be steel tubing, timber or concrete and may be driven into the ground or set in concrete.  End, corner or gate posts, commonly referred to as \"terminal posts\", must be set in concrete footing or otherwise anchored to prevent leaning under the tension of a stretched fence.  Posts set between the terminal posts are called \"line posts\" and are set at intervals not to exceed 10 feet. The installer attaches the fence at one end, stretches it, and attaches at the other, easily removing the excess by \"unscrewing\" a wire.  Finally, the installer ties the fence to the line posts with aluminum wire.  In many cases, the installer stretches a bottom tension wire, sometimes referred to as \"coil wire\", between terminal posts to help minimize the in and out movement that occurs at the bottom of the chain-link mesh between posts.  Top horizontal rails are used on most chain-link fences, although not necessary.  Bottom rails may be added in lieu of bottom tension wires, and for taller fences, 10 feet or more, intermediate horizontal rails are often added.\n\nOnce stretched, a bottom wire should be secured to the line posts and the chain-link mesh \"hog ringed\" to the tension wire 2' on center.  One generally installs this wire before installing the chain-link mesh.\n\n==Manufacturing==\nThe manufacturing of chain-link fencing is called [[weaving]]. A metal [[wire]], often [[Galvanized steel|galvanized]] to reduce [[corrosion]], is pulled along a rotating long and flat [[blade]], thus creating a somewhat flattened [[Helix|spiral]]. The spiral continues to rotate past the blade and winds its way through the previous spiral that is already part of the fence. When the spiral reaches the far end of the fence, the spiral is cut near the blade. Next, the spiral is pressed flat and the entire fence is moved up, ready for the next cycle. The end of every second spiral overlaps the end of every first spiral. The machine clamps both ends and gives them a few twists. This makes the links permanent.\n\nAn improved version of the weaving machine winds two wires around the blade at once to create a [[double helix]]. One of the spirals is woven through the last spiral that is already part of the fence. This improvement allows the process to advance twice as fast.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3LnjVXTfXc Chain link weaving machine - video]</ref>\n\n==Notable uses==\n[[File:DirtTrackRacingLateModels.jpg|thumb|right|Chain-link fencing at an American short track]]\n[[File:Kenny King vs. Zema Ion - Dark Match.jpg|thumb|right|Chain-link, steel cage as used in an [[Impact Wrestling]] professional wrestling match]]\n* Used to notable effect in the [[Gehry Residence]] by [[Frank Gehry]]\n* In [[Professional Wrestling]], several wrestling match variations require that chain-link fencing surround the ring in an open \"cage\" style.

The [[wire]]s run vertically and are bent into a zig-zag pattern so that each \"zig\" hooks with the wire immediately on one side and each \"zag\" with the wire immediately on the other.  This forms the characteristic [[Polyiamond|diamond]] pattern seen in this type of fence.\n\n==Development of chain-link fencing==\n[[File:Chain-link and barbed wire.jpg|thumb|right|A chain-link privacy fence topped with [[barbed tape|razor wire]] protecting a utility power substation.]]\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the firm of [[Barnard, Bishop & Barnard]] was established in [[Norwich]] to produce chain-link fencing by machine. The process was developed by Charles Barnard in 1844 based on cloth weaving machines (up until that time Norwich had a long history of cloth manufacture).<ref>Ward, Ken. [http://www.oldcity.org.uk/norwich/history/history08.php Victorian Norwich]. A History of Norwich, 28 November 2006, p. 6.</ref>\n\nThe Anchor Post Fence Co., established in 1891, bought the rights to the wire-weaving machine and was the first company to manufacture chain-link fencing in the United States. Anchor Fence also holds the first United States patent for chain-link. The machine was purchased from a man in 1845 from Belgium who originally invented the wire bending machine.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for this sentence which conflicts with the previous information|date=March 2017}}\n\n==Sizes and uses==\nIn the [[United States]], fencing usually comes in 20&nbsp;ft and 50&nbsp;ft rolls, which can be joined by \"unscrewing\" one of the end wires and then \"screwing\" it back in so that it hooks both pieces. Common heights include 3&nbsp;ft, 3&nbsp;ft 6 in, 4&nbsp;ft, 5&nbsp;ft, 6&nbsp;ft, 7&nbsp;ft, 8&nbsp;ft, 10&nbsp;ft, and 12&nbsp;ft, though almost any height is possible. Common mesh gauges are 9, 11, and 11.5. Mesh length can also vary based on need, with the standard diamond size being 2\". For tennis courts and ball parks, the most popular height is 10&nbsp;or 12 feet, and tennis courts use a diamond size of 1.75\" <ref>Long Fence {{cite web |url=http://www.longfence.com/commercial/fence/chain-link |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411062526/http://www.longfence.com/commercial/fence/chain-link |archivedate=2013-04-11 }}</ref> measured flat side to flat side.  Tennis courts often use this smaller diamond size so that power hitters won't be able to lodge the ball into a larger diamond size.\n\nThe popularity of chain-link fence is from its relatively low cost and that the open weave does not obscure sunlight from either side of the fence. One can make a chain-link fence semi-opaque by [[fence insert|inserting slats]] into the mesh.  Allowing ivy to grow and interweave itself is also popular.\n\n==Installation==\n\nThe installation of chain-link fence involves setting posts into the ground and attaching the fence to them.  The posts may be steel tubing, timber or concrete and may be driven into the ground or set in concrete.  End, corner or gate posts, commonly referred to as \"terminal posts\", must be set in concrete footing or otherwise anchored to prevent leaning under the tension of a stretched fence.  Posts set between the terminal posts are called \"line posts\" and are set at intervals not to exceed 10 feet. The installer attaches the fence at one end, stretches it, and attaches at the other, easily removing the excess by \"unscrewing\" a wire.  Finally, the installer ties the fence to the line posts with aluminum wire.  In many cases, the installer stretches a bottom tension wire, sometimes referred to as \"coil wire\", between terminal posts to help minimize the in and out movement that occurs at the bottom of the chain-link mesh between posts.  Top horizontal rails are used on most chain-link fences, although not necessary.  Bottom rails may be added in lieu of bottom tension wires, and for taller fences, 10 feet or more, intermediate horizontal rails are often added.\n\nOnce stretched, a bottom wire should be secured to the line posts and the chain-link mesh \"hog ringed\" to the tension wire 2' on center.  One generally installs this wire before installing the chain-link mesh.\n\n==Manufacturing==\nThe manufacturing of chain-link fencing is called [[weaving]]. A metal [[wire]], often [[Galvanized steel|galvanized]] to reduce [[corrosion]], is pulled along a rotating long and flat [[blade]], thus creating a somewhat flattened [[Helix|spiral]]. The spiral continues to rotate past the blade and winds its way through the previous spiral that is already part of the fence. When the spiral reaches the far end of the fence, the spiral is cut near the blade. Next, the spiral is pressed flat and the entire fence is moved up, ready for the next cycle. The end of every second spiral overlaps the end of every first spiral. The machine clamps both ends and gives them a few twists. This makes the links permanent.\n\nAn improved version of the weaving machine winds two wires around the blade at once to create a [[double helix]]. One of the spirals is woven through the last spiral that is already part of the fence. This improvement allows the process to advance twice as fast.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3LnjVXTfXc Chain link weaving machine - video]</ref>\n\n==Notable uses==\n[[File:DirtTrackRacingLateModels.jpg|thumb|right|Chain-link fencing at an American short track]]\n[[File:Kenny King vs. Zema Ion - Dark Match.jpg|thumb|right|Chain-link, steel cage as used in an [[Impact Wrestling]] professional wrestling match]]\n* Used to notable effect in the [[Gehry Residence]] by [[Frank Gehry]]\n* In [[Professional Wrestling]], several wrestling match variations require that chain-link fencing surround the ring in an open \"cage\" style.

Personas provide designers a precise way of thinking and communicating about how groups of users behave, how they think, what they want to accomplish and why.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Cooper| first1=Alan| last2=Reimann| first2=Robert| last3=Cronin| first3=David| last4=Noessel| first4=Christopher| title=About Face: The Essentials of Interaction Design| date=2 September 2014| publisher=Wiley| isbn=978-1-118-76657-6| page=62| edition=4th}}</ref> Once created, personas help the designer to understand the users' goals in specific contexts, which is particularly useful during ideation and for validating design concepts. Other types of models include workflow models, artifact models, and physical models.\n\n;Design\nWhen the designer has a firm grasp on the user's needs and goals, they begin to sketch out the interaction framework (also known as [[Website wireframe|wireframes]]). This stage defines the high-level structure of screen layouts, as well as the product's flow, behavior, and organization. There are many kinds of materials that can be involved during this iterative phase, from whiteboards to paper prototypes. As the interaction framework establishes an overall structure for product behavior, a parallel process focused on the visual and industrial designs. The visual design framework defines the experience attributes, visual language, and the visual style.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Cooper| first1=Alan| last2=Reimann| first2=Robert| last3=Cronin| first3=David| last4=Noessel| first4=Christopher| title=About Face: The Essentials of Interaction Design| date=2014| publisher=Wiley| isbn=978-1-118-76657-6| page=131| edition=4th}}</ref>\n\nOnce a solid and stable framework is established, wireframes are translated from sketched storyboards to full-resolution screens that depict the user interface at the pixel level. At this point, it's critical for the programming team to collaborate closely with the designer. Their input is necessary to create a finished design that can and will be built while remaining true to the concept.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n \n;Test and iterate\nUsability testing is carried out by giving users various tasks to perform on the prototypes.

Information is communicated to the users through text and images. Much importance is given to how the text and images look and attract users. Graphic designers have to make stylistic choices about things like font color, font type, and image locations. Graphic designers focus on grabbing the user's attention with the way the design looks. Graphic designers create visual concepts, using computer software or by hand, to communicate ideas that inspire, inform, and captivate consumers. They develop the overall layout and production design for various applications such as advertisements, brochures, magazines, and corporate reports.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htm | title=Graphic Designers | publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor | work=Occupational Outlook Handbook | date=December 17, 2015 | accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Visual designers===\nThe visual designer (VisD) ensures that the visual representation of the design effectively communicates the data and hints at the expected behavior of the product.

For players who become emotionally invested in their games this spices things up for them and leaves them with a tough decision.\n\n==Testing the design==\n{{Main||Usability testing}}\nUsability testing is the most common method used by designers to test their designs. The basic idea behind conducting a usability test is to check whether the design of a product or brand works well with the target users. While carrying out usability testing, two things are being tested for: Whether the design of the product is successful and if it is not successful, how can it be improved. While designers are testing, they are testing the design and not the user. Also, every design is evolving.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} The designers carry out usability testing at every stage of the design process.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/usability-testing.html| title=Usability Testing| last=| first=| date=| website=usability.gov| publisher=| access-date=}}</ref>\n\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Action research]]\n* [[Activity-centered design]]\n* [[Customer experience]]\n* [[Design thinking]]\n* [[Paper prototyping]]\n* [[Participatory design]]\n* [[Process-centered design]]\n* [[User experience evaluation]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n<br>\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book | isbn = 9780123740373 | title = Sketching User Experiences: Getting the Design Right and the Right Design | last1 = Buxton | first1 = Bill | year = 2010| pages = 436 }}\n* {{cite book | isbn = 9780672316494 | title = The Inmates Are Running the Asylum: Why High-Tech Products Drive Us Crazy and How to Restore the Sanity | last1 = Cooper | first1 = Alan | year =1999  | pages = 261 }}\n* {{cite book | isbn = 9781118766576 | title = About Face: The Essentials of Interaction Design | last1 = Cooper | first1 = Alan | last2=Reimann |first2=Robert| last3=Cronin| first3=David| last4=Noessel| first4=Christopher| year = 2014 | edition=4th }}\n* {{cite book | isbn = 978-1940805375 | title = Mapping Methods 2: Step-by-step guide Experience Maps Journey Maps Service Blueprints Affinity Diagrams Empathy Maps Business Model Canvas | last1 = Curedale | first1 = Robert | year = 2018 | edition=2nd}}\n* {{cite book | isbn = 9780262134743 | title = Designing Interactions | last1 = Moggridge | first1 = Bill | year = 2006 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/designinginterac00mogg/page/766 766] | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/designinginterac00mogg/page/766 }}\n* {{cite book | isbn = 9783642133626 | title = User Experience Design: Mit erlebniszentrierter Softwareentwicklung zu Produkten, die begeistern | last1 = Moser | first1 = Christian | year = 2008  | pages = 252 }}\n* {{cite book | isbn = 9780465067107 | title = The Design of Everyday Things | last1 = Norman | first1 = Donald | title-link = The Design of Everyday Things | year = 2013| pages = 351 }}\n* {{cite book | isbn = 9781449379704 | title = Designing Interfaces | url = https://archive.org/details/designinginterfa00tidw | url-access = registration | last1 = Tidwell | first1 = Jenifer | year = 2005  | pages = 332 }}\n\n{{Design}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:User Experience Design}}\n[[Category:Human\u2013computer interaction]]\n[[Category:User interfaces]]\n[[Category:Design]]\n[[Category:Web design]]\n[[Category:Software development process]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Field of design focusing on the creation of user centered products and services}}\n{{More citations needed|date=March 2012}}\n'''User experience design''' ('''UXD''', '''UED''', or '''XD''') is the process of [[User behavior analytics|manipulating user behavior]]<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dsz5AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage|title=Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products|last=Eyal|first=Nir|date=2014-11-04|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9780698190665|language=en}}</ref> through [[usability]], usefulness, and [[desirability]] provided in the interaction with a product.<ref>{{ cite book | first = Aaron | last = Schmidt | author2 = Amanda Etches | title = Useful, Usable, Desirable: Applying User Experience Design | year = 2014 }}</ref> User experience design encompasses traditional [[human\u2013computer interaction]] (HCI) design and extends it by addressing all aspects of a product or service as perceived by users.

There are many kinds of materials that can be involved during this iterative phase, from whiteboards to paper prototypes.

User experience has improved in gaming by providing people with a higher picture and resolution quality.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://uxplanet.org/game-design-ux-best-practices-guide-4a3078c32099|title=Game Design UX Best Practices // The Ultimate Guide|last=Dori|first=Amir|date=2019-10-02|website=Medium|language=en|access-date=2019-12-14}}</ref> In the past, the original [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Nintendo gaming systems]] had very blurry and distorted graphics and did not provide users with clear on-screen graphical content. Users and game developers wanted more than just a distorted image to control in a 2D platform. With new desires to give gamers a better user experience and user interface, the creation of new 3D game designing came about.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cultureofgaming.com/evolution-video-game-graphics/|title=The Evolution of Video Game Graphics|last=admin|date=2018-01-18|website=Culture of Gaming|language=en-AU|access-date=2019-12-14}}</ref> The addition of a 3D imagery systems gave designers new usability options and allowed players of 3D games to explore around a 3D virtual map, like in [[Mario Bros.]] This new 3D animation was just the spark that would light the fire for the advancement of graphical content to come and also resulted in more realistic and real-world oriented game imaging.<ref>{{Cite document|title=ShieldSquare Captcha|doi=10.1088/1742-6596/1087/6/062024}}</ref>\n\nAs more consoles are released the user interface of graphics greatly increases.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hongkiat.com/blog/video-games-ui-evolution/|title=Evolution of Video Games User Interfaces|date=2013-04-29|website=Hongkiat|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-14}}</ref> Consoles such as [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] are the latest next-generation consoles that portray realistic graphics that results in giving players a more exciting user experience. Games that include high level graphics are ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'', ''[[NBA 2K19]]'', and ''[[Madden NFL 19]]''. In ''Madden'' and ''NBA'' users can play with their real-life favorite sports players that almost look exactly the same. The picture for the games even captures tattoos and certain distinct facial features found on videogame characters' real-life version.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fun.com/blog/p-956-madden-nfl-evolution-of-a-video-game-franchise-infographic.aspx|title=Madden NFL: Evolution of a Video Game Franchise [Infographic]|last=Rubink|first=Devin|website=Fun.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-14}}</ref>\tFurthermore, storyline enhancements have resulted in the user interfaces of video games gaining popular feedback from fans and contribute to the achievement of the game as a whole.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.techtimes.com/articles/84016/20150914/how-video-games-have-become-the-perfect-storytelling-medium.htm|title=How Video Games Have Become The Perfect Storytelling Medium|last=Burks|first=Robin|date=2015-09-14|website=Tech Times|language=en|access-date=2019-12-14}}</ref> According to Robin Burks, \u201cplaying a video game involves more interaction than watching a film or television series. For example, scenes pause as players are forced to decide who lives and who dies: and sometimes, players must make that choice quickly. This interaction means that the player becomes part of the story and not just an inactive participant.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.techtimes.com/articles/84016/20150914/how-video-games-have-become-the-perfect-storytelling-medium.htm|title=How Video Games Have Become The Perfect Storytelling Medium|last=Burks|first=Robin|date=2015-09-14|website=Tech Times|language=en|access-date=2019-12-14}}</ref> The quick decision making and on edge approach to video game storylines impact the way players shape their own user experience. In some circumstances, users could be faced with choosing life or death between two of their favorite characters. For players who become emotionally invested in their games this spices things up for them and leaves them with a tough decision.\n\n==Testing the design==\n{{Main||Usability testing}}\nUsability testing is the most common method used by designers to test their designs. The basic idea behind conducting a usability test is to check whether the design of a product or brand works well with the target users. While carrying out usability testing, two things are being tested for: Whether the design of the product is successful and if it is not successful, how can it be improved. While designers are testing, they are testing the design and not the user. Also, every design is evolving.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} The designers carry out usability testing at every stage of the design process.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/usability-testing.html| title=Usability Testing| last=| first=| date=| website=usability.gov| publisher=| access-date=}}</ref>\n\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Action research]]\n* [[Activity-centered design]]\n* [[Customer experience]]\n* [[Design thinking]]\n* [[Paper prototyping]]\n* [[Participatory design]]\n* [[Process-centered design]]\n* [[User experience evaluation]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n<br>\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book | isbn = 9780123740373 | title = Sketching User Experiences: Getting the Design Right and the Right Design | last1 = Buxton | first1 = Bill | year = 2010| pages = 436 }}\n* {{cite book | isbn = 9780672316494 | title = The Inmates Are Running the Asylum: Why High-Tech Products Drive Us Crazy and How to Restore the Sanity | last1 = Cooper | first1 = Alan | year =1999  | pages = 261 }}\n* {{cite book | isbn = 9781118766576 | title = About Face: The Essentials of Interaction Design | last1 = Cooper | first1 = Alan | last2=Reimann |first2=Robert| last3=Cronin| first3=David| last4=Noessel| first4=Christopher| year = 2014 | edition=4th }}\n* {{cite book | isbn = 978-1940805375 | title = Mapping Methods 2: Step-by-step guide Experience Maps Journey Maps Service Blueprints Affinity Diagrams Empathy Maps Business Model Canvas | last1 = Curedale | first1 = Robert | year = 2018 | edition=2nd}}\n* {{cite book | isbn = 9780262134743 | title = Designing Interactions | last1 = Moggridge | first1 = Bill | year = 2006 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/designinginterac00mogg/page/766 766] | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/designinginterac00mogg/page/766 }}\n* {{cite book | isbn = 9783642133626 | title = User Experience Design: Mit erlebniszentrierter Softwareentwicklung zu Produkten, die begeistern | last1 = Moser | first1 = Christian | year = 2008  | pages = 252 }}\n* {{cite book | isbn = 9780465067107 | title = The Design of Everyday Things | last1 = Norman | first1 = Donald | title-link = The Design of Everyday Things | year = 2013| pages = 351 }}\n* {{cite book | isbn = 9781449379704 | title = Designing Interfaces | url = https://archive.org/details/designinginterfa00tidw | url-access = registration | last1 = Tidwell | first1 = Jenifer | year = 2005  | pages = 332 }}\n\n{{Design}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:User Experience Design}}\n[[Category:Human\u2013computer interaction]]\n[[Category:User interfaces]]\n[[Category:Design]]\n[[Category:Web design]]\n[[Category:Software development process]]\n", "name_user": "John B123", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eInteraction design:Fixed cite error", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design"}
