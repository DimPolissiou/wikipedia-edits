releases an IDR 10.3 trillion stimulus policy to the tourism sector, in the form of ticket price discounts and restaurant tax deductions. \nThe IDR 10.3 trilion budget is given to provide discounted ticket prices for 10 tourist destinations, such as [[Batam]], [[Denpasar]], [[Yogyakarta]], [[Labuan Bajo]], [[Lombok]], [[Malang]], [[Manado]], [[Lake Toba]] ([[Silangit Airport]]), [[Tanjung Pandan]], and [[Tanjungpinang]], which applies from March to May 2020. Ticket prices for low-cost airlines are discounted by 50%, medium-service by 48%, and full-service by 45%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://industri.kontan.co.id/news/pemerintah-tetapkan-insentif-penerbangan-tiket-pesawat-diskon-hingga-50|title=Pemerintah tetapkan insentif penerbangan, tiket pesawat diskon hingga 50%|last=|first=|date=2020-02-25|website=Kontan.co.id|language=id|access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref> Specifically for this ticket price discount, the stimulus fund comes from the IDR 444.39 billion-state budget (APBN) for a discounted value of 30% and 25% of passengers per flight.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnnindonesia.com/ekonomi/20200226091352-532-478192/jurus-jokowi-lawan-virus-corona-dengan-diskon-tiket-pesawat|title=Jurus Jokowi Lawan Virus Corona dengan Diskon Tiket Pesawat|last=Ananda|first=Aria|date=|website=CNNIndonesia.com|language=id-ID|access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref> Additionally, there are additional ticket discounts paid by Angkasa Pura I and Angkasa Pura II in the amount of Rp100 billion and PT Pertamina (Persero) in the amount of Rp260 billion through avtur price discounts, so the total ticket price stimulus is IDR 960 billion so that the ticket price can be discounted by 50%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wartaekonomi.co.id/read273843/lihat-nih-terbang-ke-10-destinasi-wisata-ini-diskonnya-hingga-50|title=Lihat Nih!

They left their other company holdings inherited from their grandfather H. W. Corbett, with experienced managements already in place, such as their holdings in ''Union Pacific Railroad'', the Portland headquartered ''Home Telephone Company'', the ''Oregon Electric Railway'', the ''Oregon Surety and Casualty Company'' and the ''[[Portland Hotel]]'', to largely operate on their own, usually retaining the role of directors (occasionally as officers) or even just passive shareholders so as to free themselves from their active day-to-day management.\n\nThe Corbett Investment Company's offices were located in the Corbett Building, at Southwest Fifth Avenue and Morrison, overlooking the Pioneer Courthouse.<ref>Senator H.

Corbett]] and his brother-in-law [[Henry Failing]] (with his father Josiah Failing) purchased almost all the shares of the Bank. H. W. Corbett held 500 shares, Henry Failing 250 and his father Josiah 50.<ref>Corbett and the Failings had then immediately increased the bank\u2019s then capitalisation from $100,000 to $250,000 (which was further increased by the owners over succeeding years). ''Merchants, Money and Power: The Portland Establishment, 1843-1913''. E. Kimbark MacColl with Harry H. Stein, The Georgian Press, 1988, p. 149</ref>\n\nThe First National Bank of Portland had been the only bank in Portland (and for a long time the only one west of the [[Rocky Mountains]]) that was chartered under the [[National Banking Act]].<ref>The National Banking Act of 1863 required nationally chartered banks to hold one third of the capital of the bank in US Treasury bonds. It allowed them in return to issue a uniform bank note backed by the bonds. The amount of the notes not to exceed 90 percent of the value of the bonds.</ref> The act was intended to make banking safer and guarantee the value of bank notes in effect creating a nationwide currency.<ref>In 1865 the U.S. Congress enacted a 10 percent tax on any bank or individual using state bank notes. As a result, a number of banks converted to national charters, but many simply stopped issuing notes. Instead, demand deposit money was introduced \u2014 checking accounts.</ref> There was no state-banking act in Oregon until 1907 so other banks at the time were strictly private proprietorships taking deposits and lending money without regulation.<ref>''Oregon Argonauts: Merchant Adventurers on the Western Frontier''. Arthur L. Throckmorton, Oregon Historical Society, 1961, p. 313.</ref> The First National was the exception from its outset.\n\nOn their purchase, Henry Failing had become President of the bank, Henry W. Corbett the Vice-President. Failing held the position until his unexpected death in 1898 when Corbett assumed the President\u2019s role until his own death in 1903.<ref name=\"auto1\">''The Growth of a City: Power and Politics in Portland, Oregon !915 to 1950'', E.Kimbark MacColl, Georgian Press,Portland, Oregon, 1979.</ref>\n\nElliott Corbett looked after the interests of the Corbett brothers in the Bank on behalf of the Corbett estate and also served as Vice-President and a director of the bank.\n[[File:First_National_Bank_Building%2C_Portland%2C_Oregon_-_Marlitt.jpg|left|thumb|[[First National Bank Building (Portland, Oregon)|The First National Bank Building]].<br>Built in 1916 when Elliott Corbett was responsible for the ownership.<br> (Michael Marlitt photo 2018)]]\nOn H.W. Corbett's death Abbot L. Mills was appointed President and the bank continued to prosper and grow. He retired in 1927. C.F. Adams succeeded him as President from 1927 until 1932.\n\nThe Bank grew solidly under the Mills and Corbett stewardship and soon had outgrown its quarters, so they constructed a new building as its main office. In 1916 the new [[First National Bank Building (Portland, Oregon)|First National Bank building]] was opened at 401\u2013409 SW 5th Avenue, Portland.<ref>[[First National Bank Building (Portland, Oregon)|First National Bank building]] architect was Coolidge and Shattuck of Boston. Its design may have been influenced by the classicism of Henry Bacon's marble Lincoln Memorial classicism that had made an impact at the time when the memorial plans were unveiled for it in 1914 (although it was not completed and dedicated until 1922).</ref> The building became known as \"The Marble Temple\".<ref>[[First National Bank Building (Portland, Oregon)|First National Bank building]] is now listed on The [[National Register of Historic Places]].</ref>\n\nAfter Mills' retirement and when his successor C.F. Adams was nearing retirement, Elliott Corbett needed to prepare a successor to Adams. Since 1911 the Strong and McNaughton Trust Company had managed the properties of the Corbett estate. So in 1928 Elliott Corbett offered their Trust a merger with the First National's Security and Saving Trust Company.<ref>Brother Hamilton F. Corbett was president of The Security and Saving Trust Company.</ref> He also offered the position of a bank vice-president to MacNaughton. MacNaughton accepted Corbett's offer,<ref>E.B. McNaughton later succeeded as President when the bank changed ownership.</ref> although Strong opted to remain in his own Trust business managing the Corbett estate.<ref>''The Growth of a City: Power and Politics in Portland, Oregon 1915 to 1950'', E.Kimbark MacColl, Georgian Press,Portland, Oregon, 1979.</ref>\n\nBanking in Portland, however, would change. The West Coast Bancorp merged with the US National Bank in early 1928. With this development Elliott Corbett knew that to stay ahead of their rivals the Corbetts and the other major stockholders, the Failings and Lewis families, would likely have to inject more capital into the bank to expand. Otherwise they could make a public share offering to increase the bank's capital. Elliott Corbett had been concerned for a while that bank shares were undervalued.  Banking was therefore a less attractive investment than real estate and other opportunities which were opening up to them for the utilisation of their capital. He and the other stockholders were not in favour of increasing its capital by injecting more of their own or in diluting their own shareholdings by issuing more shares through a public offering. During the years since the Corbetts had been involved, the First National bank had been regarded as solidly run and \"typifying the extreme conservatism for which Portland had been celebrated for half a century.\"<ref>Oregon Voter, June 14, 1930</ref>\n\nThe option was therefore open to them to sell the bank. It was an attractive option for the Corbetts and to the other minority stockholders. A ready purchaser was quickly found in the San Francisco based Transamerica, which owned [[Bank of America]] and Bancitaly, which was trying to strengthen its position on the West coast to compete with the New York and East coast banks.<ref>\"The First National of Portland, Oregon, resources $50,000,000 ... purchased.\" ''The Story of Bank of America: Biography of a Bank'', Marquis James, Bessie R.

Ladd's foundation, The Ladd and Tilton Bank, had already been sold under the presidency of his eldest son William M. Ladd. It had actually been under the control of his brother-in-law [[Frederic B. Pratt]] of New York, who was a part owner of Standard Oil. Elliott Corbett had declined to have the First National Bank take it over because of the risk inherant for the First National Bank when the Ladd and Tilton had got into financial difficulty. The Pratts and William M. Ladd had instead overseen its orderly transition for its depositors who were none the wiser over its difficulties and the fact that a number of family members had protected them at considerable cost. The Ladd and Tilton was amalgamated with the US National Bank in 1924 and its customer accounts safely transferred there.

Wood however took mischievous delight in giving Senator Corbett and other leading businessmen an annual subscription to the ''Masses''. ''Diaries of Judge Matthew P.

They soon had increasing numbers of cattle on the range again. Between 1907 and 1913 the company built 17 and a half miles of new channels from the Donner and Blitzen Rivers in order to improve drainage of the wetlands.

This was twenty-two years after their original investment and the brothers were apparently relieved to dispose of their remaining shares in the company to Swift as by then it was a losing proposition.

Miss Lefler played the piano. 'Onward Christian Soldiers' we did with gusto. One little girl reported to her mother...that we sang a song about their dog. The hymn was 'Holy, holy, holy'. The dog's name was Oley. After the hymn we would settle down for a talk by Nurse Cochrane. The talk was generally about a small boy named Sammy. Nurse with her hands behind her back walked up and down telling us about Sammy and temptation, or Sammy and lying, or stealing cookies. Sammy would wrestle with the problem. Either God's word saved him from wrong doing, or he would go ahead and do what he knew was wrong. In the latter case Sammy wouldn't rest easy, his conscience wouldn't let him alone until he finally 'fessed up' and made peace with God or whoever it was that he had wronged.<br>\"...I have no idea how long Sunday school lasted, but I can't forget dear Nurse Cochrane, small, plump, marching back and forth, her Scotch accent enhancing the Sammy stories through which the word of God was put before us.\"<br>'' Riverdale School: 1888-1988'', Helen Weiman Bledsoe, Binford & Mort, Portland, Oregon 1988, p.59-60.</ref>\n\n[[File:Caroline Ladd Corbett Macadam 1.jpg|left|thumb|Better exposed image but otherwise same as Caroline Ladd Corbett Macadam|thumb|Caroline Ladd Corbett]]\n\n===Caroline Ladd Corbett===\nBorn 20 September 1910 in Portland Oregon.

Corbett]] and his brother-in-law [[Henry Failing]] (with his father Josiah Failing) purchased almost all the shares of the Bank. H. W. Corbett held 500 shares, Henry Failing 250 and his father Josiah 50.<ref>Corbett and the Failings had then immediately increased the bank\u2019s then capitalisation from $100,000 to $250,000 (which was further increased by the owners over succeeding years). ''Merchants, Money and Power: The Portland Establishment, 1843-1913''. E. Kimbark MacColl with Harry H. Stein, The Georgian Press, 1988, p. 149</ref>\n\nThe First National Bank of Portland had been the only bank in Portland (and for a long time the only one west of the [[Rocky Mountains]]) that was chartered under the [[National Banking Act]].<ref>The National Banking Act of 1863 required nationally chartered banks to hold one third of the capital of the bank in US Treasury bonds. It allowed them in return to issue a uniform bank note backed by the bonds. The amount of the notes not to exceed 90 percent of the value of the bonds.</ref> The act was intended to make banking safer and guarantee the value of bank notes in effect creating a nationwide currency.<ref>In 1865 the U.S. Congress enacted a 10 percent tax on any bank or individual using state bank notes. As a result, a number of banks converted to national charters, but many simply stopped issuing notes. Instead, demand deposit money was introduced \u2014 checking accounts.</ref> There was no state-banking act in Oregon until 1907 so other banks at the time were strictly private proprietorships taking deposits and lending money without regulation.<ref>''Oregon Argonauts: Merchant Adventurers on the Western Frontier''. Arthur L. Throckmorton, Oregon Historical Society, 1961, p. 313.</ref> The First National was the exception from its outset.\n\nOn their purchase, Henry Failing had become President of the bank, Henry W. Corbett the Vice-President. Failing held the position until his unexpected death in 1898 when Corbett assumed the President\u2019s role until his own death in 1903.<ref name=\"auto1\">''The Growth of a City: Power and Politics in Portland, Oregon !915 to 1950'', E.Kimbark MacColl, Georgian Press,Portland, Oregon, 1979.</ref>\n\nElliott Corbett looked after the interests of the Corbett brothers in the Bank on behalf of the Corbett estate and also served as Vice-President and a director of the bank.\n[[File:First_National_Bank_Building%2C_Portland%2C_Oregon_-_Marlitt.jpg|left|thumb|[[First National Bank Building (Portland, Oregon)|The First National Bank Building]].<br>Built in 1916 when Elliott Corbett was responsible for the ownership.<br> (Michael Marlitt photo 2018)]]\nOn H.W. Corbett's death Abbot L. Mills was appointed President and the bank continued to prosper and grow. He retired in 1927. C.F. Adams succeeded him as President from 1927 until 1932.\n\nThe Bank grew solidly under the Mills and Corbett stewardship and soon had outgrown its quarters, so they constructed a new building as its main office. In 1916 the new [[First National Bank Building (Portland, Oregon)|First National Bank building]] was opened at 401\u2013409 SW 5th Avenue, Portland.<ref>[[First National Bank Building (Portland, Oregon)|First National Bank building]] architect was Coolidge and Shattuck of Boston. Its design may have been influenced by the classicism of Henry Bacon's marble Lincoln Memorial classicism that had made an impact at the time when the memorial plans were unveiled for it in 1914 (although it was not completed and dedicated until 1922).</ref> The building became known as \"The Marble Temple\".<ref>[[First National Bank Building (Portland, Oregon)|First National Bank building]] is now listed on The [[National Register of Historic Places]].</ref>\n\nAfter Mills' retirement and when his successor C.F. Adams was nearing retirement, Elliott Corbett needed to prepare a successor to Adams. Since 1911 the Strong and McNaughton Trust Company had managed the properties of the Corbett estate. So in 1928 Elliott Corbett offered their Trust a merger with the First National's Security and Saving Trust Company.<ref>Brother Hamilton F. Corbett was president of The Security and Saving Trust Company.</ref> He also offered the position of a bank vice-president to MacNaughton. MacNaughton accepted Corbett's offer,<ref>E.B. McNaughton later succeeded as President when the bank changed ownership.</ref> although Strong opted to remain in his own Trust business managing the Corbett estate.<ref>''The Growth of a City: Power and Politics in Portland, Oregon 1915 to 1950'', E.Kimbark MacColl, Georgian Press,Portland, Oregon, 1979.</ref>\n\nBanking in Portland, however, would change. The West Coast Bancorp merged with the US National Bank in early 1928. With this development Elliott Corbett knew that to stay ahead of their rivals the Corbetts and the other major stockholders, the Failings and Lewis families, would likely have to inject more capital into the bank to expand. Otherwise they could make a public share offering to increase the bank's capital. Elliott Corbett had been concerned for a while that bank shares were undervalued.  Banking was therefore a less attractive investment than real estate and other opportunities which were opening up to them for the utilisation of their capital. He and the other stockholders were not in favour of increasing its capital by injecting more of their own or in diluting their own shareholdings by issuing more shares through a public offering. During the years since the Corbetts had been involved, the First National bank had been regarded as solidly run and \"typifying the extreme conservatism for which Portland had been celebrated for half a century.\"<ref>Oregon Voter, June 14, 1930</ref>\n\nThe option was therefore open to them to sell the bank. It was an attractive option for the Corbetts and to the other minority stockholders. A ready purchaser was quickly found in the San Francisco based Transamerica, which owned [[Bank of America]] and Bancitaly, which was trying to strengthen its position on the West coast to compete with the New York and East coast banks.<ref>\"The First National of Portland, Oregon, resources $50,000,000 ... purchased.\" ''The Story of Bank of America: Biography of a Bank'', Marquis James, Bessie R. James, published 1954, 2002 reprint, Beard Books, p.310.</ref> An agreement was signed with Transamerica, in June 1930 and completed in 1932.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nAs a result, for the first time in over sixty years the Corbett family no longer controlled a bank in Portland.<ref>Their grandfather William S. Ladd's foundation, The Ladd and Tilton Bank, had already been sold under the presidency of his eldest son William M. Ladd. It had actually been under the control of his brother-in-law [[Frederic B. Pratt]] of New York, who was a part owner of Standard Oil. Elliott Corbett had declined to have the First National Bank take it over because of the risk inherant for the First National Bank when the Ladd and Tilton had got into financial difficulty. The Pratts and William M. Ladd had instead overseen its orderly transition for its depositors who were none the wiser over its difficulties and the fact that a number of family members had protected them at considerable cost. The Ladd and Tilton was amalgamated with the US National Bank in 1924 and its customer accounts safely transferred there.

They soon had increasing numbers of cattle on the range again. Between 1907 and 1913 the company built 17 and a half miles of new channels from the Donner and Blitzen Rivers in order to improve drainage of the wetlands. They also authorised construction of eight miles of the Busse Ditch and four miles of the Stubblefield Ditch to improve water distribution in the north end of the valley.<ref name=\"auto3\">''Malheur's legacy : celebrating a century of conservation, 1908-2008: Malheur National Wildlife Refuge Southeast Oregon.''

This was twenty-two years after their original investment and the brothers were apparently relieved to dispose of their remaining shares in the company to Swift as by then it was a losing proposition.

He was the author of ''Nineteenth Street'', Richard Marlitt, Oregon Historical Society, 1968 and ''Matters of Proportion: Portland Residential Architecture of Whidden & Lewis'', Richard Marlitt, Oregon Historical Society,1989.</ref>  Lucy served in the [[Red Cross]] during [[World War II]] and during the reconstruction of Germany afterwards. She was a generous donor to the [[Portland Art Museum]] of the works she and her husband had collected by the American [[Ashcan School]] and [[American Impressionism]] School of painters. She was a board member and active supporter of various other social and cultural organisations including the [[Portland Art Museum]], the [[Oregon Historical Society]] and many others. They had two sons Thomas Corbett Marlitt and Michael Ladd Marlitt.\n\nElliott and Alta had no sons but Elliott's brother [[Henry L. Corbett]] named his youngest son after him, Elliott Ruggles Corbett (1922-1944). He was killed in action, aged 22, during the Allied liberation of Europe in WWII a few months before the end of hostilities. His parents donated the [[Elliott Corbett Memorial State Recreation Site]] in their son's memory).<ref>Born 1 November 1922. Died in action November 19, 1944. Buried in Margraten War Cemetery, Holland.</ref>\n\nElliott also had two grandsons named after him, Elliott Corbett Trommald and Elliott Corbett Macadam.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Recreations==\n\nElliott, along with his brothers, was a football player at Harvard University and at the Multnomah Athletic Club in his younger years. He was also a good horseman and polo player in Oregon. He was a keen fly fisherman and keen duck and quail hunter and excellent shot both with a shotgun, rifle and revolver. He and his wife took their family on camping trips with packhorse trains in the Oregon mountains.<ref>With Ed their long-time groom. ''Caroline Corbett Reminiscences'' and photos. Elliott R.

Corbett Dunthorpe house in 1915 from the SE.<br>(Elliott R. Corbett Archives)]]\nAfter their marriage Elliott Corbett and his wife lived in the Park Blocks at 243 W. Park Avenue Portland, now 1119 SW Park, formerly the W. M. Ladd residence.<ref>W. M. LADD HOME SOLD FOR $90,000, Elliott and Henry Corbett Purchase Handsome Residence Property.

Corbett (original house N. front) 1915.jpeg|thumb|Elliott R. Corbett Dunthorpe house north front 1915. In 1939 Elliott took off chimney & west end to right & third floor above.<br>(Elliott R. Corbett Archives)]]\nElliott and Alta Corbett then were intent on a move from the busy downtown area. Elliott and his brother Henry. L. Corbett commissioned [[A. E. Doyle]] and Associates to design two houses with adjoining grounds on six acres in Portland Heights<ref>Elliott R. Corbett house, National Register of Historic Places, Section 8 Page 5.<br> An A.E Doyle rendering for a Portland Heights house (never built) is held at the OHS, researched by Gaye Richardson.</ref> which ultimately were never built.\n\nElliott Corbett and his wife in 1913 embarked on the building of a \"country cottage\" in what became the Dunthorpe area that was about to be opened up for development near Lake Oswego.<ref>Dunthorpe was to be a new development on the former William S.Ladd (his maternal grandfather) and Simeon Reed's ''Oregon Iron and Steel Company'' lands. All properties there required a minimum of acreage of land for the house's grounds and various other stipulations.</ref> While doing so the Corbetts decided to make the \"cottage\" at 01600 SW Greenwood Road<ref>Designed by Whitehouse & Fouilhaux</ref> in Dunthorpe, their main residence so their children could grow up in a semi-rural environment. It was completed in the fall of 1915 and the 32 year old Elliott Corbett and his 29 year old wife Alta moved there with their then three daughters in time for Thanksgiving.<ref>Elliott R. Corbett house, National Register of Historic Places, Section 8 Page 5.</ref> It was the first house to be built in the new area of [[Dunthorpe]].\n[[File:Elliott R. Corbett House in 2013.jpg|thumb|[[Elliott R. Corbett House]] present front externally same as after the 1939 alterations.(NRHP)<br>(Photo: Steve Morgan)]]\nThe Elliott Corbett property was set in 32 acres containing a two-story three-bay car garage with an under-car mechanic's well and workshop and staff quarters above, a separate barn and stables for their riding horses and groom's quarters (both entered by a side drive off the main circular one), a gardener's cottage adjacent to SW Iron Mountain Road (now Blvd.), a pair of tennis courts, a swimming pool and a children's \"Swings and Rings\" play area, all at a distance from the main house and mostly not within sight of it.<ref>The southern boundary of the property abutted SW Iron Mountain Road (now Blvd.) running from Greenwood Road to approximately opposite SW Glen Road at the time. The property has since been subdivided but the main house remained in 2018 very similar to the house in which Elliott Corbett had lived out his life.</ref>\n\nMany of their Portland friends thought it was an unwise move but Elliott's brother Henry Ladd Corbett decided to follow suit and soon many of the leading Portland families had decided to build their homes there. An area which used to seem quite a distance from Portland became a pleasant area to bring up large families.\n\nThe Elliott Corbett's five daughters were brought up there. After the three eldest were married and the two younger were away at College, Elliott took off part of the west end in 1939, including the large formal living room, and the second and third floor above it <ref>Letters and photographs detailing alterations from Elliott Corbett to his daughter Caroline Macadam.<br>Archive of weekly letters from Elliott R.Corbett and Alta S. Corbett to their eldest daughter Caroline or her husband Ivison Macadam in UK (ERC and ASC 1934-1962), (ASC only 1962-1975).<br> Elliott Corbett archives, Runton.</ref> to make the house more compact for their smaller family then living there and created a new formal West walled garden for his wife on the former larger West wing foundation.<ref>This alteration by the Corbetts to their home required a new lower north front gable to be installed over the existing protruding semi-roof. The difference can be seen on the right (west) side of the two lower photographs of the house. A new fireplace and chimney was also installed on the other (south) side for a smaller second living room.</ref>\n\nThe [[Elliott R. Corbett House]] is now listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] and its front appears today as it looked after Corbett made the modifications.<ref>National Register of Historic Places: https://npgallery.nps.gov/pdfhost/docs/NRHP/Text/96001070.pdf.</ref>\n\nElliott and Alta also had a beach house on the [[Oregon Coast]] at [[Gearhart, Oregon]] and in later years, after giving that  to their children and their families, had a smaller beach house on the sand dunes at [[Surf Pines, Oregon]] north of Gearhart.<ref>Later given to a daughter and her family.</ref>\n\nElliott and his son-in-law Dr. Donald Forster also built the Don Elliott fishing cabin on the [[Deschutes River (Oregon)|Deschutes River]] in eastern Oregon.\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Corbett, Elliott R}}\n[[Category:1884 births]]\n[[Category:1963 deaths]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople from Portland, Oregon]]\n[[Category:Corbett family|Elliott]]\n[[Category:Harvard University alumni]]\n[[Category:American bankers]]\n[[Category:American philanthropists]]\n[[Category:Philanthropists from Oregon]]\n[[Category:Burials at River View Cemetery (Portland, Oregon)]]\n[[Category:People from Clatsop County, Oregon]]\n[[Category:20th-century philanthropists]]\n", "name_user": "William Macadam", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eLucy Elliott Corbett:corrected my error.

At the same time, the [[Russian Empire]] expanded into previously Ottoman ruled or Ottoman allied regions of the Caucasus and the Black Sea region. Many of the local Muslims in these countries suffered as many died during the conflicts and others fled. The persecution of Muslims was continued during [[World War I]] by the invading Russian troops in the east and the [[Caucasus]] and during the [[Turkish War of Independence]] in the west, east, and south of Anatolia. After the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u20131922)|Greco-Turkish War]], a [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey|population exchange]] took place and most Muslims in Greece left.

Some of the settlers were [[Y\u00f6r\u00fcks]], nomads who quickly became sedentary, and others were from urban classes. They settled in almost all of the towns, but the majority of them settled in the Eastern Balkans. The main areas of settlement were [[Ludogorie]], [[Dobrudzha]], the Thracian plain, the mountains and plains of northern [[Greece]] and Eastern Macedonia around the [[Vardar]] river.\n\nBetween the 15th and 17th centuries, large numbers of native Balkan peoples converted to [[Islam]].

During this era, the Austrian Empire outlined its position to the Bosnian Muslim population about living within its administration. Two options were offered by [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] such as a [[conversion to Christianity]] while retaining property and remaining on Austrian territory, or for a departure of those remaining Muslim to other lands.<ref>al-Arnaut, Muhamed Mufaku (1994). \"Islam and Muslims in Bosnia 1878\u20131918: Two Hijras and Two Fatw\u0101s\". ''Journal of Islamic Studies''. '''5'''. (2): 245\u2013246. \"This being the case, the Muslim Bosnians could no longer imagine any existence for Muslims outside the ''devlet'' unless they lived outside the pale of the ''din'', it cannot be denied that the attitude of neighbouring countries had influenced this state of mind. For after two centuries of stability and supremacy ''d\u0101r ar-Isl\u0101m'' was no longer immune from attack. Muslims now faced a new, unexpected, inconceivable situation. The triumph of their Christian enemies meant that, in order to survive, the Muslims had to choose either to Christianize and remain inside the Christian state or to emigrate southwards in order to remain Muslims within the Muslim state. Thus we notice that Austria in particular, when changing from the defensive to the offensive, was concentrating on Bosnia, but without its Muslims. in the war of 1737\u20139 we find Emperor Charles VI, in the edict addressed to the Muslim Bosnians dated June 1737, outlining two options for them: 'whoever of them wishes to adopt Christianity, may be free to stay and retain his property, while those who do not may emigrate to wherever they want' They fared no better in the 1788\u201391 war, although Emperor Joseph I issued a proclamation in which he promised to respect Muslim rights and institutions. However, despite these pledges, the Muslims quickly disappeared from the areas ceded by the Ottoman Empire.\"</ref>\n\n=== Montenegro ===\nAt the beginning of the 18th century (1709 or 1711) Orthodox [[Serbs]] massacred their Muslim neighbors in [[Montenegro]].<ref name=\"Black2007\">{{cite book|last=Black|first=Jeremy|authorlink=Jeremy Black (historian)|title=European Warfare in a Global Context, 1660\u20131815|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JvZ9AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA192|date=12 February 2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-15922-2|page=192|quote=The Muslim population of Montenegro was massacred by the Serbs.}}</ref><ref name=\"Kir\u00e1lyRothenberg1982\">{{cite book|last1=Kir\u00e1ly|first1=B\u00e9la K.|authorlink1=B\u00e9la K.

Cambridge University Press. p. 28-29. \" As the characteristically high urbanization of Ottoman Europe reflected institutional structure rather than economic complexity, the dissolution of Ottoman institutions by the successor states could cause rapid deurbanization. This process occurred in its most striking form in Serbia. In the eighteenth century, Ottoman Serbia was highly urbanized, but during the wars and the revolutionary upheaval of 1789\u20141815, the Serbian towns experienced a precipitous decline. In 1777, there were reportedly some 6,000 houses in Belgrade,\" from which a population of 30,000 \u2014 55,000 may be estimated. By about 1800, the town had shrunk to around 3,000 houses with 25,000 inhabitants, and in 1834 the number of houses had fallen further to 769. Late-eighteenth-century U\u017eice had 2,900 Muslim houses; this indicates a population of around 20,000, for when the last 3,834 Muslims were driven from the town in 1862, they vacated 550 houses. Tihomir Dordevi\u0107 put the population of U\u017eice in the late eighteenth century still higher, at 12,000 houses with about 60,000 inhabitants. By 1860, when U\u017eice's population was 4,100, but still overwhelmingly Muslim, the effects of the town's decline were all too visible, the bazaars 'rotting and ruinous', and 'whole streets which stood here before the Servian revolution... turned into orchards'. In 1863, after the expulsions, there remained in the town a population of some 2,490. Valjevo in the 1770s was also a substantial place with 3,000 Muslim and 200 Christian houses. At least 5 other towns had 200 \u2014 500 houses each. Given the low population density of Ottoman Serbia, a remarkably high proportion of its inhabitants were town dwellers. Belgrade ''pa\u0161aluk'' in the late eighteenth century had 376,000 Serbian and 40,000 \u2014 50,000 Turkish inhabitants. On this basis, the two largest towns alone would have accounted for 11\u201427 per cent of the population of the ''pa\u0161aluk''. The urban proportion could have been higher still, for a number of smaller towns dwindled into villages on the departure of the Ottomans.</ref><ref name=gran>{{cite book|last=Grandits|first=Hannes|title=Conflicting Loyalties in the Balkans: The Great Powers, the Ottoman Empire and Nation-Building|year=2011|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9781848854772|page=208}}</ref> \nSome Muslim families then migrated and resettled in Bosnia, where their descendants today reside in urban centres such as [[\u0160amac, Bosnia and Herzegovina|\u0160amac]], [[Tuzla]], [[Fo\u010da]] and [[Sarajevo]].<ref>Zulfikarpa\u0161i\u0107, Adil (1998).

(4) : 460\u2013461. \"In consequence of the Russian-Ottoman war, a violent expulsion of nearly the entire Muslim, predominantly Albanian-speaking, population was carried out in the sanjak of Ni\u0161 and Toplica during the winter of 1877\u20141878 by the Serbian troops. This was one major factor encouraging further violence, but also contributing greatly to the formation of the League of Prizren. The league was created in an opposing reaction to the Treaty of San Stefano and the Congress of Berlin and is generally regarded as the beginning of the Albanian national movement. The displaced persons (Alb. ''muhaxhir\u00eb'', Turk. ''muhacir'', Serb. ''muhad\u017eir'') took refuge predominantly in the eastern parts of Kosovo. The Austro-Hungarian consul Jelinek reported in April 1878.... The account shows that these displaced persons (''muhaxhir\u00eb'') were highly hostile to the local Slav population. But also the Albanian peasant population did not welcome the refugees, since they constituted a factor of economic rivalry. As a consequence of these expulsions, the interreligious and interethnic relations worsened. Violent acts of Muslims against Christians, in the first place against Orthodox but also against Catholics, accelerated. This can he explained by the fears of the Muslim population in Kosovo that were stimulated by expulsions of large Muslim population groups in other parts of the Balkans in consequence of the wars in the nineteenth century in which the Ottoman Empire was defeated and new Balkan states were founded. The latter pursued a policy of ethnic homogenisation expelling large Muslim population groups.\"</ref><ref>Stefanovi\u0107. ''Seeing the Albanians''. 2005. p. 470. \"The 'cleansing' of Toplica and Kosanica would have long-term negative effects on Serbian-Albanian relations. The Albanians expelled from these regions moved over the new border to Kosovo, where the Ottoman authorities forced the Serb population out of the border region and settled the refugees there. Janji\u0107ije Popovi\u0107, a Kosovo Serb community leader in the period prior to the Balkan Wars, noted that after the 1876\u20138 wars, the hatred of the Turks and Albanians towards the Serbs 'tripled'. A number of Albanian refugees from Toplica region, radicalized by their experience, engaged in retaliatory violence against the Serbian minority in Kosovo. In 1900 \u017divojin Peri\u0107, a Belgrade Professor of Law, noted that in retrospect, 'this unbearable situation probably would not have occurred had the Serbian government allowed Albanians to stay in Serbia'. He also argued that conciliatory treatment towards Albanians in Serbia could have helped the Serbian government to gain the sympathies of Albanians of the Ottoman Empire. Thus, while both humanitarian concerns and Serbian political interests would have dictated conciliation and moderation, the Serbian government, motivated by exclusive nationalist and anti-Muslim sentiments, chose expulsion. The 1878 cleansing was a turning point because it was the first gross and large-scale injustice committed by Serbian forces against the Albanians. From that point onward, both ethnic groups had recent experiences of massive victimization that could be used to justify 'revenge' attacks. Furthermore, Muslim Albanians had every reason to resist the incorporation into the Serbian state.\"</ref>\n\n===Bosnia===\nIn 1875 a conflict between Muslims and Christians broke out in Bosnia.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} After the Ottoman Empire signed the treaty at the 1878 Berlin Congress, Bosnia was occupied by Austria-Hungary.<ref name=al-Arnaut /> Bosnian Muslims (Bosniaks) perceived this as a betrayal by the Ottomans and left on their own, felt that they were defending their homeland and not the wider Empire.<ref name=al-Arnaut /> From 9 July until 20 October 1878 or for almost three months, Bosnian Muslims resisted Austro-Hungarian forces in nearly 60 military engagements with 5000 casualties either wounded or killed.<ref name=al-Arnaut /> Some Bosnian Muslims concerned about their future and well being under the new non-Muslim administration, left Bosnia for the Ottoman Empire.<ref name=al-Arnaut>al-Arnaut, Muhamed Mufaku (1994). \"Islam and Muslims in Bosnia 1878\u20131918: Two Hijras and Two Fatw\u0101s\".

(2): 246\u2013247. \"As for Bosnia, the treaty signed at the congress of Berlin in 1878 stunned the Muslims of that country who did not believe that the Ottoman Empire would forsake them so easily, and did not docilely resign themselves to the new Austro-Hungarian rule. They set up a government for their own defence and fiercely resisted the Austro-Hungarian forces for about three months (29 July-20 October 1878), a period which witnessed nearly sixty military clashes and resulted in 5000 casualties either killed or wounded.\" It may be noted that this stiff resistance was carried out almost exclusively by the Muslims, who were in this instance defending the homeland or ''vatan'' (Bosnia) and not the ''devlet'' (the Ottoman Empire) which forsook them. The Ottoman government had indeed seen in this resistance an opportunity to improve its own position and scored several points in its favour at the Istanbul Convention of 21 April 1879. For example, it was emphasized that the fact of occupation constituted no infringement of the' sovereign rights of the sultan over Bosnia, that the Muslims had the right to maintain their ties with Istanbul, that the name of the sultan could be mentioned in the Friday prayer sermon and on similar occasions, and that the Ottoman flag could be raised on the mosques.\" But this new situation created such a nightmare that some elderly men preferred to confine themselves to their homes rather than see 'infidels' in the streets. The Muslims, who had not yet recovered from the 1878 shock, were taken aback by the new military service law of 1881 which applied to Muslim youths also. This increased dissatisfaction with the new situation and speeded up hijra to the Ottoman Empire.\"</ref> From 1878 until 1918, between 130,000<ref name=Kaser2011>{{cite book|last=Kaser|first=Karl|title=The Balkans and the Near East: Introduction to a Shared History|year=2011|publisher=LIT Verlag M\u00fcnster|isbn=9783643501905|page=336|url=https://books.google.com/?id=j3i8muwLf8AC&pg=PA336&dq=bosnia+1878++occupation+130000#v=onepage&q=bosnia%201878%20%20occupation%20130000&f=false}}</ref> and 150,000 Bosnian Muslims departed Bosnia to areas under Ottoman control, some to the [[Balkans]], others to [[Anatolia]], the [[Levant]] and [[Maghreb]].<ref>al-Arnaut. ''Islam and Muslims in Bosnia 1878\u20131918''. 1994. p. 243. \"As regards Bosnia, we have a ''hijra'' that deserves close attention, namely that which took place during the time of Ausrro-Hungarian rule (1878\u20131918) and evicted about 150,000 Muslims from Bosnia.[5] There are considerable differences in the estimates of the numbers of Bosnians emigrating to the Ottoman Empire during the period of Austro-Hungarian rule (1878\u20131915). The official statistics of the Austro-Hungarian administration admit that 61,000 Muslims emigrated, while Bogi\u010devi\u0107 gives 150,000, Smlati\u0107 gives 160,000, and Imamovi\u0107's estimate ranges between 150.000 and 180,000. Newspaper estimates rise to 300,000 and popular accounts put a figure as high as 700,000. Official statistics no doubt reduced the number of emigrants to make them equal the number of settlers who stayed in Bosnia (63,376). If we look at Ottoman data, we will find a wide gap between them and the Austro-Hungarian data. The Istanbul High Commissioners Office for Facilitating Refugee Settlement told Hiviz Bjelevac, the Bosnian writer, that during 1900\u201305 alone 73,000 Muslims left Bosnia, while Austro-Hungarian statistics give the much smaller number of 13,150. From all that has been said above, a figure like 150,000 will probably be more realistic.

McCarthy demonstrates that not all of the ethnic cleansing and ethnic killing in the Ottoman Empire in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries followed the model often posited in the West, whereby all the victims were Christian and all the perpetrators were Muslim. McCarthy has shown that there were mass killings of Muslims and deportations of millions of Muslims from the Balkans and the Caucasus over the course of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. McCarthy, who is labeled (correctly in this author's estimation) as being pro- Turkish by some writers and is a denier of the Armenian genocide, has estimated that about 5.5 million Muslims were killed in the hundred years from 1821\u20131922.

At the same time, the [[Russian Empire]] expanded into previously Ottoman ruled or Ottoman allied regions of the Caucasus and the Black Sea region. Many of the local Muslims in these countries suffered as many died during the conflicts and others fled. The persecution of Muslims was continued during [[World War I]] by the invading Russian troops in the east and the [[Caucasus]] and during the [[Turkish War of Independence]] in the west, east, and south of Anatolia. After the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u20131922)|Greco-Turkish War]], a [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey|population exchange]] took place and most Muslims in Greece left. During these centuries many Muslim refugees, called [[Muhacir]], settled in [[Turkey]].\n\n==Background==\n\n=== Turkish presence and Islamisation of native peoples in the Balkans ===\nFor the first time, Ottoman military expeditions shifted from Anatolia to Europe and the Balkans with the occupation of the Gallipoli peninsula in the 1350s.<ref>Norman Itzkowitz, [https://books.google.gr/books?id=aapbAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA12&dq= Ottoman Empire and Islamic Tradition]. University of Chicago Press, 2008, {{ISBN|9780226098012}}, p. 12</ref> After the region was conquered by the Muslim Ottoman Empire, the Turkish presence grew. Some of the settlers were [[Y\u00f6r\u00fcks]], nomads who quickly became sedentary, and others were from urban classes. They settled in almost all of the towns, but the majority of them settled in the Eastern Balkans. The main areas of settlement were [[Ludogorie]], [[Dobrudzha]], the Thracian plain, the mountains and plains of northern [[Greece]] and Eastern Macedonia around the [[Vardar]] river.\n\nBetween the 15th and 17th centuries, large numbers of native Balkan peoples converted to [[Islam]]. Places of mass conversions were in [[Bosnia]], [[Albania]], [[Crete]], and the [[Rhodope Mountains]].<ref>Conversion to Islam in the Balkans: Kisve Bahas \u0327petitions and Ottoman Social Life, 1670\u20131730, Anton Minkov, BRILL, 2004, {{ISBN|9004135766}}.</ref> Some of the native population converted to [[Islam]] and became [[Turkish people|Turkish]] over time, mainly those in Anatolia.<ref>The Geography of the Middle East, Stephen Hemsley Longrigg, James P.

Most of [[Hungary]], [[Podolia]], and the [[Morea]] was lost. The Ottomans regained the Morea quickly, and Muslims soon became part of the population or were never thoroughly displaced in the first place.\n\nMost of the Christians who lived in the Ottoman Empire were Orthodox so [[Russian Empire|Russia]] was particularly interested in them.

During this era, the Austrian Empire outlined its position to the Bosnian Muslim population about living within its administration. Two options were offered by [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] such as a [[conversion to Christianity]] while retaining property and remaining on Austrian territory, or for a departure of those remaining Muslim to other lands.<ref>al-Arnaut, Muhamed Mufaku (1994). \"Islam and Muslims in Bosnia 1878\u20131918: Two Hijras and Two Fatw\u0101s\". ''Journal of Islamic Studies''. '''5'''. (2): 245\u2013246. \"This being the case, the Muslim Bosnians could no longer imagine any existence for Muslims outside the ''devlet'' unless they lived outside the pale of the ''din'', it cannot be denied that the attitude of neighbouring countries had influenced this state of mind. For after two centuries of stability and supremacy ''d\u0101r ar-Isl\u0101m'' was no longer immune from attack. Muslims now faced a new, unexpected, inconceivable situation. The triumph of their Christian enemies meant that, in order to survive, the Muslims had to choose either to Christianize and remain inside the Christian state or to emigrate southwards in order to remain Muslims within the Muslim state. Thus we notice that Austria in particular, when changing from the defensive to the offensive, was concentrating on Bosnia, but without its Muslims. in the war of 1737\u20139 we find Emperor Charles VI, in the edict addressed to the Muslim Bosnians dated June 1737, outlining two options for them: 'whoever of them wishes to adopt Christianity, may be free to stay and retain his property, while those who do not may emigrate to wherever they want' They fared no better in the 1788\u201391 war, although Emperor Joseph I issued a proclamation in which he promised to respect Muslim rights and institutions. However, despite these pledges, the Muslims quickly disappeared from the areas ceded by the Ottoman Empire.\"</ref>\n\n=== Montenegro ===\nAt the beginning of the 18th century (1709 or 1711) Orthodox [[Serbs]] massacred their Muslim neighbors in [[Montenegro]].<ref name=\"Black2007\">{{cite book|last=Black|first=Jeremy|authorlink=Jeremy Black (historian)|title=European Warfare in a Global Context, 1660\u20131815|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JvZ9AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA192|date=12 February 2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-15922-2|page=192|quote=The Muslim population of Montenegro was massacred by the Serbs.}}</ref><ref name=\"Kir\u00e1lyRothenberg1982\">{{cite book|last1=Kir\u00e1ly|first1=B\u00e9la K.|authorlink1=B\u00e9la K.

This process occurred in its most striking form in Serbia. In the eighteenth century, Ottoman Serbia was highly urbanized, but during the wars and the revolutionary upheaval of 1789\u20141815, the Serbian towns experienced a precipitous decline. In 1777, there were reportedly some 6,000 houses in Belgrade,\" from which a population of 30,000 \u2014 55,000 may be estimated. By about 1800, the town had shrunk to around 3,000 houses with 25,000 inhabitants, and in 1834 the number of houses had fallen further to 769. Late-eighteenth-century U\u017eice had 2,900 Muslim houses; this indicates a population of around 20,000, for when the last 3,834 Muslims were driven from the town in 1862, they vacated 550 houses. Tihomir Dordevi\u0107 put the population of U\u017eice in the late eighteenth century still higher, at 12,000 houses with about 60,000 inhabitants. By 1860, when U\u017eice's population was 4,100, but still overwhelmingly Muslim, the effects of the town's decline were all too visible, the bazaars 'rotting and ruinous', and 'whole streets which stood here before the Servian revolution... turned into orchards'. In 1863, after the expulsions, there remained in the town a population of some 2,490. Valjevo in the 1770s was also a substantial place with 3,000 Muslim and 200 Christian houses. At least 5 other towns had 200 \u2014 500 houses each. Given the low population density of Ottoman Serbia, a remarkably high proportion of its inhabitants were town dwellers. Belgrade ''pa\u0161aluk'' in the late eighteenth century had 376,000 Serbian and 40,000 \u2014 50,000 Turkish inhabitants. On this basis, the two largest towns alone would have accounted for 11\u201427 per cent of the population of the ''pa\u0161aluk''. The urban proportion could have been higher still, for a number of smaller towns dwindled into villages on the departure of the Ottomans.</ref><ref name=gran>{{cite book|last=Grandits|first=Hannes|title=Conflicting Loyalties in the Balkans: The Great Powers, the Ottoman Empire and Nation-Building|year=2011|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9781848854772|page=208}}</ref> \nSome Muslim families then migrated and resettled in Bosnia, where their descendants today reside in urban centres such as [[\u0160amac, Bosnia and Herzegovina|\u0160amac]], [[Tuzla]], [[Fo\u010da]] and [[Sarajevo]].<ref>Zulfikarpa\u0161i\u0107, Adil (1998).

This was one major factor encouraging further violence, but also contributing greatly to the formation of the League of Prizren. The league was created in an opposing reaction to the Treaty of San Stefano and the Congress of Berlin and is generally regarded as the beginning of the Albanian national movement. The displaced persons (Alb. ''muhaxhir\u00eb'', Turk. ''muhacir'', Serb. ''muhad\u017eir'') took refuge predominantly in the eastern parts of Kosovo. The Austro-Hungarian consul Jelinek reported in April 1878.... The account shows that these displaced persons (''muhaxhir\u00eb'') were highly hostile to the local Slav population. But also the Albanian peasant population did not welcome the refugees, since they constituted a factor of economic rivalry. As a consequence of these expulsions, the interreligious and interethnic relations worsened. Violent acts of Muslims against Christians, in the first place against Orthodox but also against Catholics, accelerated. This can he explained by the fears of the Muslim population in Kosovo that were stimulated by expulsions of large Muslim population groups in other parts of the Balkans in consequence of the wars in the nineteenth century in which the Ottoman Empire was defeated and new Balkan states were founded. The latter pursued a policy of ethnic homogenisation expelling large Muslim population groups.\"</ref><ref>Stefanovi\u0107.

The Albanians expelled from these regions moved over the new border to Kosovo, where the Ottoman authorities forced the Serb population out of the border region and settled the refugees there. Janji\u0107ije Popovi\u0107, a Kosovo Serb community leader in the period prior to the Balkan Wars, noted that after the 1876\u20138 wars, the hatred of the Turks and Albanians towards the Serbs 'tripled'. A number of Albanian refugees from Toplica region, radicalized by their experience, engaged in retaliatory violence against the Serbian minority in Kosovo. In 1900 \u017divojin Peri\u0107, a Belgrade Professor of Law, noted that in retrospect, 'this unbearable situation probably would not have occurred had the Serbian government allowed Albanians to stay in Serbia'. He also argued that conciliatory treatment towards Albanians in Serbia could have helped the Serbian government to gain the sympathies of Albanians of the Ottoman Empire. Thus, while both humanitarian concerns and Serbian political interests would have dictated conciliation and moderation, the Serbian government, motivated by exclusive nationalist and anti-Muslim sentiments, chose expulsion. The 1878 cleansing was a turning point because it was the first gross and large-scale injustice committed by Serbian forces against the Albanians. From that point onward, both ethnic groups had recent experiences of massive victimization that could be used to justify 'revenge' attacks. Furthermore, Muslim Albanians had every reason to resist the incorporation into the Serbian state.\"</ref>\n\n===Bosnia===\nIn 1875 a conflict between Muslims and Christians broke out in Bosnia.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} After the Ottoman Empire signed the treaty at the 1878 Berlin Congress, Bosnia was occupied by Austria-Hungary.<ref name=al-Arnaut /> Bosnian Muslims (Bosniaks) perceived this as a betrayal by the Ottomans and left on their own, felt that they were defending their homeland and not the wider Empire.<ref name=al-Arnaut /> From 9 July until 20 October 1878 or for almost three months, Bosnian Muslims resisted Austro-Hungarian forces in nearly 60 military engagements with 5000 casualties either wounded or killed.<ref name=al-Arnaut /> Some Bosnian Muslims concerned about their future and well being under the new non-Muslim administration, left Bosnia for the Ottoman Empire.<ref name=al-Arnaut>al-Arnaut, Muhamed Mufaku (1994). \"Islam and Muslims in Bosnia 1878\u20131918: Two Hijras and Two Fatw\u0101s\".

They set up a government for their own defence and fiercely resisted the Austro-Hungarian forces for about three months (29 July-20 October 1878), a period which witnessed nearly sixty military clashes and resulted in 5000 casualties either killed or wounded.\" It may be noted that this stiff resistance was carried out almost exclusively by the Muslims, who were in this instance defending the homeland or ''vatan'' (Bosnia) and not the ''devlet'' (the Ottoman Empire) which forsook them. The Ottoman government had indeed seen in this resistance an opportunity to improve its own position and scored several points in its favour at the Istanbul Convention of 21 April 1879. For example, it was emphasized that the fact of occupation constituted no infringement of the' sovereign rights of the sultan over Bosnia, that the Muslims had the right to maintain their ties with Istanbul, that the name of the sultan could be mentioned in the Friday prayer sermon and on similar occasions, and that the Ottoman flag could be raised on the mosques.\" But this new situation created such a nightmare that some elderly men preferred to confine themselves to their homes rather than see 'infidels' in the streets. The Muslims, who had not yet recovered from the 1878 shock, were taken aback by the new military service law of 1881 which applied to Muslim youths also.

The official statistics of the Austro-Hungarian administration admit that 61,000 Muslims emigrated, while Bogi\u010devi\u0107 gives 150,000, Smlati\u0107 gives 160,000, and Imamovi\u0107's estimate ranges between 150.000 and 180,000. Newspaper estimates rise to 300,000 and popular accounts put a figure as high as 700,000. Official statistics no doubt reduced the number of emigrants to make them equal the number of settlers who stayed in Bosnia (63,376). If we look at Ottoman data, we will find a wide gap between them and the Austro-Hungarian data.

McCarthy demonstrates that not all of the ethnic cleansing and ethnic killing in the Ottoman Empire in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries followed the model often posited in the West, whereby all the victims were Christian and all the perpetrators were Muslim. McCarthy has shown that there were mass killings of Muslims and deportations of millions of Muslims from the Balkans and the Caucasus over the course of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. McCarthy, who is labeled (correctly in this author's estimation) as being pro- Turkish by some writers and is a denier of the Armenian genocide, has estimated that about 5.5 million Muslims were killed in the hundred years from 1821\u20131922. Several million more refugees poured out of the Balkans and Russian conquered areas, forming a large refugee (muhajir) community in Istanbul and Anatolia.\"</ref>\n\nHistorian Mark Biondich estimates that from 1878-1912 up to two million Muslims left the Balkans either voluntarily or involuntarily while Muslims casualties in the Balkans during 1912-1923 within the context of those killed and expelled exceeded some three million.<ref name=\"Biondich93\">{{cite book|last=Biondich|first=Mark|title=The Balkans: Revolution, War, and Political Violence Since 1878|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199299058|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gt8SDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA93&dq=Muslims+casualties+millions+Balkans#v=onepage&q=Muslims%20casualties%20millions%20Balkans&f=false|pages=93|ref=harv}} \"In the period between 1878 and 1912, as many as two million Muslims emigrated voluntarily or involuntarily from the Balkans.

In Turkey most of the Balkan refugees settled in Western Turkey and Thrace. The Caucasians, in addition to these areas also settled in Central Anatolia and around the Black Sea coast. Eastern Anatolia was not largely settled with the exception of some Circassian and Karapapak villages. There were also completely new villages founded by refugees, for example in uninhabited forested areas. Many people of the 1924 exchange were settled in former Greek villages along the Aegean coast. Outside of Turkey, Circassians were settled along the [[Hedjaz Railway]] and some Cretan Muslims at Syria's coast.\n\n==Destruction of Muslim heritage==\nMuslim heritage was extensively targeted during the persecutions. During their long rule the Ottomans had built numerous [[mosque]]s, [[madrasa]]s, [[caravanserai]]s, [[Turkish bath|bath-houses]] and other types of buildings. According to current research, around 20,000 buildings of all sizes have been documented in official Ottoman registers.<ref name=Kiel90 /> However very few survives of this Ottoman heritage in most of the Balkan countries.<ref name=Lynn01>{{cite book|last=Meskell|first=Lynn|title=Archaeology Under Fire: Nationalism, Politics and Heritage in the Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134643905|pages=121, 122|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QaWEAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA120&dq=Now,+almost+nothing+of+Ottoman+heritage+survives+in+most+of+the+Balkan+countries#v=onepage&q=Now%2C%20almost%20nothing%20of%20Ottoman%20heritage%20survives%20in%20most%20of%20the%20Balkan%20countries&f=false}}</ref> Most of the Ottoman era mosques of the Balkans have been destroyed and from the ones still standing at least their [[minaret]]s.

The second element ''krathum'' (Thai: \u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e17\u0e38\u0e48\u0e21) means 'bur-flower tree' (''Anthocephalus chinensis'').\n\n==Geography==\nBang Krathum's topography consists of flat, fertile lowlands.  Clockwise from the north, the subdistrict is bordered by [[Wang Nam Khu]] (of [[Mueang Phitsanulok District]]), [[Tha Tan]], [[Nakhon Pa Mak]], [[Phai Lom, Phitsanulok|Phai Lom]], [[Ta Fo]] (of [[Mueang Phichit District]] in [[Phichit Province]]), [[Sanam Khli]], [[Khok Salut]] and [[Ban Rai]]. Bang Krathum lies in the [[Nan River#Nan Basin|Nan Basin]], which is part of the [[Chao Phraya River#Chao Phraya watershed|Chao Phraya Watershed]]. The town of [[Ban Bang Krathum]] is on the tambon's chief watercourse, a canal which winds through farms heading north-east to Ban Bang Kranoi in [[Nakhon Pa Mak]], where it joins the [[Wang Thong River]]. The canal splits once between Ban Bang Krathum and Ban Bang Krathum, where a smaller branch leads due north to Ban Bueng Lam in [[Nakhon Pa Mak]].\n\n==Administration==\nThe subdistrict is divided into 11 smaller divisions called (''[[muban]]''), which roughly correspond to the six villages in Bang Krathum.  Bang Krathum is administered by a [[Tambon administrative organization]] (TAO). The mubans in Bang Krathum are enumerated as follows:\n<ref name=\"Pitlocal.org\">[https://www.pitloklocal.org/songko47.xls Bang Krathum at Pitlocal.org]{{dead link|date=October 2016
