It first touched down along Price Road in [[Lawrence County, Mississippi]], east-southeast of the small community of [[Topeka, Mississippi|Topeka]]. Damage at the beginning of the path consisted of a few trees uprooted at EF0 strength. The tornado continued to the northeast, reaching EF2 intensity as it crossed Given Road, where a large swath of trees was flattened. EF2 damage continued to the northeast, with many large trees snapped and uprooted. A house along Rayborn Lane sustained EF1 roof damage, and two nearby sheds were damaged as well. The tornado strengthened further and reached EF3 strength as it moved through a wooded area near the [[Pearl River]], where numerous trees were snapped and partially debarked. After crossing the Pearl River, the tornado passed northeast of [[Oak Vale, Mississippi|Oak Vale]] where some homes sustained roof and exterior wall loss, numerous trees were snapped, a metal building was destroyed, and damage was rated EF2 to EF3. Crossing into [[Jefferson Davis County, Mississippi|Jefferson Davis County]], EF2 damage occurred in areas to the northeast of Oak Vale, where numerous trees and power poles were snapped, outbuildings were destroyed, homes sustained severe roof damage, and a mobile home was destroyed. A small area of EF3 damage occurred along Kirkley Lane, where some trees were denuded and partially debarked. A home and an outbuilding farther away from the center of the damage path sustained sustained EF1 damage as well. Additional EF2 damage occurred to the west and north of [[Carson, Mississippi|Carson]], where a small business housed in a manufactured structure was completely destroyed, many trees were downed, and two well-built homes had their roofs torn off. EF2 damage continued to the northeast of Carson, where several mobile homes were destroyed, another house had its roof ripped off, and multiple other homes sustained less severe roof damage.<ref name=\"dmgview\"/>\n\nCrossing [[Mississippi Highway 35]], the tornado again attained EF3 strength as the James Hill Church was completely leveled, a nearby home sustained collapse of its exterior walls, and trees were denuded and partially debarked. Multiple mobile homes were also destroyed in this area, and power poles were snapped. Additional EF3-level tree damage occurred along Terrell Road before the tornado crossed into [[Covington County, Mississippi|Covington County]]. EF3 tree damage again occurred along Three Notch Road, while a mobile home and two frame homes were destroyed nearby. The tornado weakened back to EF2 intensity as it approached and crossed [[U.S. Route 84]], snapping and uprooting numerous trees and destroying numerous chicken houses. As the tornado continued to the northeast, it produced EF1 to EF2 damage as it approached and crossed [[U.S. Route 49]] to the northwest of [[Collins, Mississippi|Collins]], downing many trees, some of which landed on homes and mobile homes. A small silo was blown over, outbuildings were destroyed, a mobile home was blown away and destroyed, and some houses sustained roof damage. Crossing Jones Chapel Road to the northeast, the tornado weakened to EF1 strength, with damage limited to downed trees. EF1 tree and outbuilding damage continued through the northwestern corner of [[Jones County, Mississippi|Jones County]] and the southwestern corner of [[Smith County, Mississippi|Smith County]], and a church sustained some damage along this segment of the path as well. EF1 damage continued into [[Jasper County, Mississippi|Jasper County]], where a house and a chicken farm were damaged, and many trees were downed in and around the small community of [[Stringer, Mississippi|Stringer]]. EF1 tree and outbuilding damage continued along the remainder of the path and through the rural community of [[Paulding, Mississippi|Paulding]] until the tornado dissipated along County Road 31 to the south of [[Rose Hill, Mississippi]].<ref name=\"JAN_0412\" /><ref name=\"dmgview\"/>\n\nRemaining on the ground for {{convert|84.1|mi|km|abbr=on|sortable=on}}, this was the longest tracked-tornado of the outbreak.

EF2 damage continued to the northeast, with many large trees snapped and uprooted. A house along Rayborn Lane sustained EF1 roof damage, and two nearby sheds were damaged as well. The tornado strengthened further and reached EF3 strength as it moved through a wooded area near the [[Pearl River]], where numerous trees were snapped and partially debarked. After crossing the Pearl River, the tornado passed northeast of [[Oak Vale, Mississippi|Oak Vale]] where some homes sustained roof and exterior wall loss, numerous trees were snapped, a metal building was destroyed, and damage was rated EF2 to EF3. Crossing into [[Jefferson Davis County, Mississippi|Jefferson Davis County]], EF2 damage occurred in areas to the northeast of Oak Vale, where numerous trees and power poles were snapped, outbuildings were destroyed, homes sustained severe roof damage, and a mobile home was destroyed. A small area of EF3 damage occurred along Kirkley Lane, where some trees were denuded and partially debarked. A home and an outbuilding farther away from the center of the damage path sustained sustained EF1 damage as well. Additional EF2 damage occurred to the west and north of [[Carson, Mississippi|Carson]], where a small business housed in a manufactured structure was completely destroyed, many trees were downed, and two well-built homes had their roofs torn off. EF2 damage continued to the northeast of Carson, where several mobile homes were destroyed, another house had its roof ripped off, and multiple other homes sustained less severe roof damage.<ref name=\"dmgview\"/>\n\nCrossing [[Mississippi Highway 35]], the tornado again attained EF3 strength as the James Hill Church was completely leveled, a nearby home sustained collapse of its exterior walls, and trees were denuded and partially debarked. Multiple mobile homes were also destroyed in this area, and power poles were snapped. Additional EF3-level tree damage occurred along Terrell Road before the tornado crossed into [[Covington County, Mississippi|Covington County]]. EF3 tree damage again occurred along Three Notch Road, while a mobile home and two frame homes were destroyed nearby. The tornado weakened back to EF2 intensity as it approached and crossed [[U.S. Route 84]], snapping and uprooting numerous trees and destroying numerous chicken houses. As the tornado continued to the northeast, it produced EF1 to EF2 damage as it approached and crossed [[U.S. Route 49]] to the northwest of [[Collins, Mississippi|Collins]], downing many trees, some of which landed on homes and mobile homes. A small silo was blown over, outbuildings were destroyed, a mobile home was blown away and destroyed, and some houses sustained roof damage. Crossing Jones Chapel Road to the northeast, the tornado weakened to EF1 strength, with damage limited to downed trees. EF1 tree and outbuilding damage continued through the northwestern corner of [[Jones County, Mississippi|Jones County]] and the southwestern corner of [[Smith County, Mississippi|Smith County]], and a church sustained some damage along this segment of the path as well. EF1 damage continued into [[Jasper County, Mississippi|Jasper County]], where a house and a chicken farm were damaged, and many trees were downed in and around the small community of [[Stringer, Mississippi|Stringer]].

{"title_page": "RNA editing", "text_new": "\n\n'''RNA editing''' is a molecular process through which some cells can make discrete changes to specific [[nucleotide sequences]] within an [[RNA]] molecule after it has been generated by [[RNA polymerase]]. RNA editing may include the insertion, deletion, and base substitution of nucleotides within the RNA molecule. RNA editing is relatively rare, with common forms of RNA processing (e.g. [[RNA splicing|splicing]], 5'-[[capping enzyme|capping]], and 3'-[[polyadenylation]]) not usually considered as editing. \n\nRNA editing has been observed in some [[tRNA]], [[rRNA]], [[mRNA]], or [[microRNA|miRNA]] molecules of [[eukaryotes]] and their [[viruses]], [[archaea]], and [[prokaryotes]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors= Su AA, Randau L |title= A-to-I and C-to-U editing within transfer RNAs |journal= Biochemistry.

In vertebrates, editing is rare and usually consists of a small number of changes to the sequence of the affected molecules. In other organisms, extensive editing (''pan-editing'') can occur, in some cases the majority of nucleotides in an mRNA sequence may result from editing.\n\nRNA-editing processes show great molecular diversity, and some appear to be evolutionarily recent acquisitions that arose independently. The diversity of RNA editing phenomena includes [[nucleobase]] modifications such as [[cytidine]] (C) to [[uridine]] (U) and [[adenosine]] (A) to [[inosine]] (I) [[deamination]]s, as well as non-template nucleotide additions and insertions.

An example of C-to-U editing is with the [[apolipoprotein B]] gene in humans. Apo B100 is expressed in the liver and apo B48 is expressed in the intestines. In the intestines, the mRNA has a CAA sequence edited to be UAA, a stop codon, thus producing the shorter B48 form. C-to-U editing often occurs in the [[mitochondrial RNA]] of flowering plants. Different plants have different degrees of C-to-U editing; for example, eight (8) editing events occur in mitochondria of the moss ''[[Funaria hygrometrica]]'', whereas over 1,700 editing events occur in the lycophytes ''[[Isoetes engelmannii|Isoetes engelmanii]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors= Takenaka M, Verbitskiy D, Zehrmann A, H\u00e4rtel B, Bayer-Cs\u00e1sz\u00e1r E, Glass F, Brennicke A |title= RNA editing in plant mitochondria\u2014connecting RNA target sequences and acting proteins |journal= Mitochondrion |volume=  19 Pt B |pages= 191\u20137 |date= Nov 2014 |pmid= 24732437 |doi= 10.1016/j.mito.2014.04.005 | series = Plant Mitochondria in Mitochondrion }}</ref> C-to-U editing is performed by members of the pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein family.

The deamination of adenosine is catalyzed by the double-stranded RNA-specific adenosine deaminase (ADAR), which typically acts on pre-mRNAs. The deamination of adenosine to inosine disrupts and destabilizes the dsRNA base pairing, therefore rendering that particular dsRNA less able to produce [[Small interfering RNA|siRNA]], which interferes with the [[RNA interference|RNAi]] pathway.\n\nThe [[wobble base pair]]ing causes deaminated RNA to have a unique but different structure, which may be related to the inhibition of the initiation step of RNA translation. Studies have shown that I-RNA (RNA with many repeats of the I-U base pair) recruits methylases that are involved in the formation of [[heterochromatin]] and that this chemical modification heavily interferes with miRNA target sites.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Nishikura K | title = Functions and regulation of RNA editing by ADAR deaminases | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 79 | issue = 1 | pages = 321\u201349 | date = 2010 | pmid = 20192758 | pmc = 2953425 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-biochem-060208-105251 }}</ref> There is active research into the importance of A-to-I modifications and their purpose in the novel concept of [[epitranscriptomics]], in which modifications are made to RNA that alter their function.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tajaddod M, Jantsch MF, Licht K | title = The dynamic epitranscriptome: A to I editing modulates genetic information | journal = Chromosoma | volume = 125 | issue = 1 | pages = 51\u201363 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 26148686 | pmc = 4761006 | doi = 10.1007/s00412-015-0526-9 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Licht K, Jantsch MF | title = Rapid and dynamic transcriptome regulation by RNA editing and RNA modifications | journal = The Journal of Cell Biology | volume = 213 | issue = 1 | pages = 15\u201322 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 27044895 | pmc = 4828693 | doi = 10.1083/jcb.201511041 }}</ref> A long established consequence of A-to-I in mRNA is the interpretation of I as a G, therefore leading to functional A-to-G substitution, e.g. in the interpretation of the genetic code by ribosomes.

Studies have shown that I-RNA (RNA with many repeats of the I-U base pair) recruits methylases that are involved in the formation of [[heterochromatin]] and that this chemical modification heavily interferes with miRNA target sites.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Nishikura K | title = Functions and regulation of RNA editing by ADAR deaminases | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 79 | issue = 1 | pages = 321\u201349 | date = 2010 | pmid = 20192758 | pmc = 2953425 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-biochem-060208-105251 }}</ref> There is active research into the importance of A-to-I modifications and their purpose in the novel concept of [[epitranscriptomics]], in which modifications are made to RNA that alter their function.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tajaddod M, Jantsch MF, Licht K | title = The dynamic epitranscriptome: A to I editing modulates genetic information | journal = Chromosoma | volume = 125 | issue = 1 | pages = 51\u201363 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 26148686 | pmc = 4761006 | doi = 10.1007/s00412-015-0526-9 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Licht K, Jantsch MF | title = Rapid and dynamic transcriptome regulation by RNA editing and RNA modifications | journal = The Journal of Cell Biology | volume = 213 | issue = 1 | pages = 15\u201322 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 27044895 | pmc = 4828693 | doi = 10.1083/jcb.201511041 }}</ref> A long established consequence of A-to-I in mRNA is the interpretation of I as a G, therefore leading to functional A-to-G substitution, e.g. in the interpretation of the genetic code by ribosomes.

By the time the first iteration of the Ty Web site was published in late 1995, only 1.4% of Americans were using the Internet.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/02/27/part-1-how-the-internet-has-woven-itself-into-american-life/ |title=How the Internet Has Woven Itself Into American Life |author=Pew Research Center |date=February 27, 2014 |access-date=June 16, 2018}}</ref> In tandem with the launch of the Ty Website, all Beanie Baby hangtags had the Ty Website [[URL]] and a [[Call to action (marketing)|call to action]] printed underneath the poems and birthdays that commanded audiences to visit the company Web site with text that read: ''Visit our web page!!!'' As a result, consumers were visiting the Ty Web site by the thousands to gain information about Beanie Babies, which was completely unprecedented at the time. Ty was the first business to leverage their Web site to connect and engage with consumers of their products. This effort evolved into the world's first [[Internet sensation]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Bissonnette|first=Zac|date=March 2015|title=The Great Beanie Baby Bubble: Mass Delusion and the Dark Side of Cute|url=|location=|publisher=Penguin Books|chapter=The $12-per-hour Sociology Major Who Made Ty Warner a Billionaire| pages=107\u2013121|isbn=1591846021}}</ref>\n\n==Fundraising==\nTy has been involved in a large amount of fundraising.

Vimes is depicted in the novels as somewhere between an [[Inspector Morse]]-type 'old-school' British policeman, and a film noir-esque grizzled detective. His appearances throughout the Discworld sequence show him slowly and grudgingly rising through the ranks of both police force and society. As of his latest promotion, his full name and title is: \"''[[Grace (style)|His Grace]], [[Excellency|His Excellency]], The [[Duke]] of Ankh; [[Commander]] [[Sir]] Samuel Vimes''\":  When serving as [[Ambassador]] for Ankh-Morpork, he is also referred to simply as \"''His Excellency''\", and is also nicknamed \"''[[Blackboard]] [[Hall monitor|Monitor]] Vimes''\",<ref>''[[The Fifth Elephant]]'', {{ISBN|0-552-14616-1}}</ref> \"Vimes the Butcher/Butcher Vimes\"<ref>''[[Monstrous Regiment (novel)|Monstrous Regiment]]'', {{ISBN|0-385-60340-1}}</ref> and \"''[[Havelock Vetinari|Vetinari's]] Terrier''\" (or his ''hammer'', depending upon the occasion):  According to his wife, [[#Lady Sybil|Sybil]], Vimes is recognised by many as Lord Vetinari's right-hand man.\n\nHe first appeared in the novel ''[[Guards! Guards!]]''.  While no detailed description of his physical appearance shows up in any of the Discworld novels, Pratchett says in the companion work, ''[[The Art of Discworld]]'', that he has always imagined Vimes as a younger, slightly bulkier version of late British actor [[Pete Postlethwaite]]. Longtime collaborative artist [[Paul Kidby]], who has worked with Pratchett on several works, portrays him instead as resembling [[Clint Eastwood]].\n\nVimes is the Commander of the [[Ankh-Morpork City Watch|City Watch]], the burgeoning police force of the [[Discworld (world)|Discworld's]] largest city, [[Ankh-Morpork]]. His rise from drunk policeman to respected member of the [[aristocracy]], and the simultaneous growth and development of the Watch under his command, have together been one of the major threads of the ''Discworld'' series. Born into poverty, (as a descendant of disgraced ancient Ankh-Morpork nobility), he is now a highly reluctant member of modern Ankh-Morpork [[nobility]], having been made both a [[knight]] and a [[duke]], as well as an ambassador. He is married to Sybil Ramkin, the richest woman in the city. They have a son, [[Sam Vimes#Young Sam|The Honourable Samuel Vimes II]].\n\n==Works==\nBeginning with ''Guards! Guards!'' in 1989, the main Discworld books featuring Sam Vimes are:\n*''[[Guards! Guards!]]'' \u2013 1989\n*''[[Men At Arms]]'' \u2013 1993\n*''[[Feet of Clay (novel)|Feet of Clay]]'' \u2013 1996\n*''[[Jingo (novel)|Jingo]]'' \u2013 1997\n*''[[The Fifth Elephant]]'' \u2013 1999\n*''[[The Truth (novel)|The Truth]]'' \u2013 2000 (minor character)\n*''[[Night Watch (Discworld)|Night Watch]]'' \u2013 2002\n*''[[Monstrous Regiment (novel)|Monstrous Regiment]]'' \u2013 2003 (minor character)\n*''[[Thud!]]'' \u2013 2005\n*''[[Where's My Cow|Where's My Cow?]]'' \u2013 2005\n*''[[Making Money]]'' \u2013 2007 (minor character)\n*''[[Unseen Academicals]]'' \u2013 2009 (minor character)\n*''[[Snuff (Pratchett novel)|Snuff]]'' \u2013 2011\n*''[[Raising Steam]]'' \u2013 2013 (supporting character)\n\n==Background==\nSam Vimes was born in Cockbill Street as the son of Thomas Vimes,<ref name=\"FOC\">''[[Feet of Clay (novel)|Feet of Clay]]'', page 36, {{ISBN|0-575-05900-1}}</ref> (son of Gwilliam Vimes)<ref name=\"FOC\"/> in the Rimwards part of the Shades, the poorest area of Ankh-Morpork. It is depicted as being so poor that there was little crime, though Sam was part of a street gang (''The Cockbill Street Roaring Lads'') with [[Discworld characters#Lupine Wonse|Lupine Wonse]] (who later became secretary to [[Havelock Vetinari|Lord Vetinari]]).\n\nVimes was educated at a [[dame school]], where he was once blackboard monitor for a whole term, before he had to drop out and concentrate on learning about life out on the streets.  It is mentioned in ''[[Jingo (novel)|Jingo]]'' that Sam Vimes' father, Thomas Vimes, had been a [[Watchman (law enforcement)|watchman]] prior to his death.  His mother would go on to tell young Sam that his father was 'run down by a cart when he was crossing the street':<ref name=\"nightwatch\">''[[Night Watch (Discworld)|Night Watch]]'', page 150, {{ISBN|0-385-60264-2}}</ref> He privately reckons later that his father was a drunk: ''Vimes had never known his father.  His mum told him that the man had been run over by a cart, but Vimes suspected that if this were true at all, then it was probably a brewer's cart, which had [[Alcoholism|'run him over' a bit at a time for years]]''.  Whatever happened to him exactly, she raised the young Sam on her own.  She died some point between the events of the \"''Glorious 25th of May''\" (she was alive during the events of ''Night Watch'') and ten years prior to the \"present-day\" events in that novel (before Vimes' first appearance in ''[[Guards! Guards!]]''), and is buried in the city's Small Gods Cemetery. In ''[[Night Watch (Discworld)|Night Watch]]'' Sam remembers that his mother had a particular skill at making Distressed Pudding.<ref>Night Watch, page 198, {{ISBN|0-385-60264-2}}</ref>\n\nThe Vimes family has historically been closely linked with the City Watch, with many members serving in it through its history.<ref name=\"FOC\"/> It has been suggested that Sam's father was a watchman in ''[[Jingo (novel)|Jingo]]'' and he is a [[Lineal descendant|descendant]] of Suffer-Not-Injustice \"Old Stoneface\" Vimes, the Watch [[Commander]] who instigated the rebellion against, and subsequently beheaded, Lorenzo the Kind, the last king of the city, a sadistic [[torturer]] described as \"[[pedophilia|very fond of children]].\" As a consequence, the Vimes family was stripped of its nobility. For three centuries afterwards, the memory of \"Old Stoneface\" has lived on in infamy and, as his descendant, Vimes has frequently endured suspicious mutterings from the aristocracy.  Vimes is implied to heavily resemble his ancestor<ref>''[[Feet of Clay (novel)|Feet of Clay]]'', page 37, {{ISBN|0-575-05900-1}}</ref> and they share a nickname: ''Old Stoneface''. ''The Annotated Pratchett File'' notes that Suffer-Not-Injustice Vimes is closely modelled on [[Oliver Cromwell]], and that the name of his supporters, the Ironheads, is a [[portmanteau]] of [[Roundheads]] and [[Ironside (cavalry)|Ironsides]], Cromwell's faction and regiment, respectively.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Annotated Pratchett File: Feet of Clay|work=l-space.org|url=http://www.lspace.org/books/apf/feet-of-clay.html|accessdate=2007-07-07}}</ref>\n\nVimes was sixteen when he joined the Watch.<ref name=\"nightwatch\" /> He was part of that section of the Watch which played a large role in the rebellion against [[Discworld characters#Lord Winder|Homicidal Lord Winder]]. It was around this time he was taught all he knew by [[Serjeant-at-Arms|Sergeant-At-Arms]] John Keel, which is where his cynical outlook on life and his firm belief in justice comes from.<ref name=\"nightwatch\" />\nIn the newest stories, Keel is [[ontological paradox|Vimes himself transported back in time]] by thirty years. As [[Lu-Tze]] explains to Vimes in ''Night Watch'', both pasts are true and there was a real John Keel. Vimes was transported back in time in the company of a criminal named Carcer, whom he was trying to apprehend. Carcer robbed and killed the real John Keel, and Vimes had to replace him in order for his role in history to be fulfilled.\n\nVimes' age is never explicitly given, and information is not always consistent. ''[[Night Watch (Discworld)|Night Watch]]'' states that Vimes was sixteen years old when he joined the City Watch. It is mentioned in ''[[Men at Arms]]'' that Vimes has been in the Watch for 25 years, making him 41 at the time of that novel. The main events of ''Night Watch'', set only a few weeks after Vimes joined the Watch, are stated as occurring more than thirty years prior to the present from which Vimes came, this makes Samuel Vimes at least 46 years old at the time of the events of that book. ''[[Thud!]]'' gives the age of Vimes' son, (also named Sam), born during the climax of ''Night Watch'', as being fourteen months,<ref>''[[Thud!]]'', page 124, {{ISBN|0-385-60867-5}}</ref> which would put Vimes at a minimum of 47 or 48 years old during the events of the book. When Vimes discusses his time as a blackboard monitor,<ref>''[[Thud!]]'', pages 79-80, {{ISBN|0-385-60867-5}}</ref> he thinks about it being \"more than 45 years ago\" and that he was six years old at the time, putting his age at least 51 years; this is confirmed when he refers to the new vampire officer, age given as 51, as being \"not that much younger than him\". It is also mentioned in ''Night Watch'', that at the time of the \"Glorious Revolution of the Twenty-Fifth of May\", both Sam Vimes and Havelock Vetinari were 16 years old, meaning that they are both the same age.\n\n==The Watch==\nDuring the first 25 years of his term in the Watch, Vimes rose to Captain of the Night Watch, a position that he attained about ten years prior to the events of ''[[Guards! Guards!]]'', as it dwindled to a tiny stub &ndash; while the power of the Thieves' Guild grew. This insult to Vimes' sense of justice, together with his being naturally knurd (the opposite of being drunk, where one is stripped of all the illusions that make life bearable) and other events (it has been claimed he was \"''brung low by a woman''\", which is an interpretation of the [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphisation]] of the city, [[Britannia|Morporkia]]), led towards heavy drinking. At this time, he lived in near poverty, giving away almost all of his salary to widows and orphans of watchmen, and spending what was left on alcohol and cheap boots.<ref>Men At Arms, {{ISBN|0552140287}}</ref>\n\nAll that changed when [[Ankh-Morpork City Watch#Captain Carrot Ironfoundersson|Carrot Ironfoundersson]] came to the city. A human raised by [[Dwarfs (Discworld)|dwarves]], Carrot joined the Watch and set out to help the city. Around the same time, a [[European dragon|dragon]] assaulted the city, and the Watch was instrumental in its defeat. The whole series of events forced Vimes to [[Sobriety|sober]]-up long enough to uncover [[Discworld characters#Lupine Wonse|who was responsible for summoning the Dragon]], after which the [[#Lady Sybil|changes in his personal life]] led to him coming off of the drink and switching to [[smoking]] [[cigars]], and occasionally, taking [[Dipping tobacco|snuff]].\n\nThe Watch was given a new headquarters, Pseudopolis Yard (an allusion to the name of the headquarters of London's Metropolitan Police: [[Scotland Yard]]), by Lady Sybil Ramkin (Vimes's soon-to-be wife) after the dragon destroyed their original base at Treacle Mine Road. It had been her childhood home, and in ''[[Thud!]]'' it is revealed that some of her family's possessions are still stored in the attic of the building &ndash; in this instance they retrieved a copy of Methodia Rascal's Koom Valley painting, made by Sybil as a child, after the original is stolen.\n\nAs part of an equal-opportunities drive required by the Patrician, the Night Watch under Vimes eventually took on extra staff in the form of a werewolf, a dwarf and a [[Troll (Discworld)|troll]] (and later a gargoyle, a gnome, a golem, an [[Igor (Discworld)|Igor]], a zombie, and a vampire). They were instrumental in foiling an attempt on the Patrician's life, and were rewarded. The Watch was rapidly revived and became increasingly important in the city.\n\nVimes, who was about to retire following his marriage to Lady Sybil, was given the resurrected rank of Commander, putting him in charge of the Night Watch and the Day Watch. He also received a [[knight]]hood.\n\nVimes took a great interest in the restructuring of the Watch, placing new Watch Houses where they were needed and supervising the creation of both a Watch Academy and a [[forensics]] section. His reform of the City Watch has been so successful that by ''Night Watch'', Vimes-trained policemen are in high demand in cities across the Disc. They are known as ''Sammies'' (which is based on the British terms for [[police officer]]s, ''[[Bobbies]]'' and, the now obsolete, ''Peelers'' both after [[Robert Peel]] and possibly on the earlier term \"Charleys\" for night watchmen, after Charles II during whose reign they were instituted), even to the people who may have never actually heard of Samuel Vimes himself. In his expanding international and diplomatic role, Vimes appreciates the fact that police officers from [[Discworld geography#Sto Lat|Sto Lat]] to [[Discworld geography#Genua|Genua]] have been trained to salute him, and remain in unofficial contact across the Disc.\n\n==Character==\nVimes is a very conflicted character:<ref name=\"nightwatch\"/> An incorruptible [[idealist]] with deep beliefs in justice and an abiding love of his city, he is also a committed [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynic]] whose knowledge of human nature constantly reminds him how far off those ideals are.<ref name=\"nightwatch\"/> A member of the upper classes, he still has an innate dislike of hereditary wealth and an instinctive revulsion towards social inequality. The Patrician observes that Vimes is anti-authoritarian even though he is, himself, an authority figure, which is \"practically [[Zen]]\".<ref>''[[Feet of Clay (novel)|Feet of Clay]]'', page 275, {{ISBN|0-575-05900-1}}</ref> The conflict within Vimes is between his virtuous nature (\"the Watchman\") and what he calls \"the Beast\". In ''[[The Art of Discworld]]'', Pratchett explains that Vimes protects himself from the Beast with the symbol of his own badge, which prevents him from becoming the criminal he despises, at least in his own mind.<ref name=\"thud\"/> Although in ''[[Guards! Guards!]]'' Vimes is all but shocked at Vetinari's disturbingly cynical (and probably disturbingly accurate) view of the world, he in turn has been called \"the most cynical bastard that ever walked under the sun\" (in ''[[I Shall Wear Midnight]]''). Although widely differing characters, Vimes and Vetinari can be called similar in that they both have very cynical worldviews, but fairly idealistic aims.\n\nVimes has once been described as a [[speciesism|speciesist]], though only from an \"old school\" mindset. He will warm up to \"good coppers\", regardless of their unusual backgrounds and has allowed the Watch to become one of the most species-blind employers in the city. Most of his officers rationalize his bias as simply not being particularly fond of ''anyone''; initially, Vimes is jokingly described as fond of rural dwarfs and wizards, primarily because most do not cause crimes relevant to him. A notable exception is his explicit dislike of vampires. He explained to Lady Margolotta in ''[[The Fifth Elephant]]'', this is because, teetotal or not, 'a vampire will always seek to dominate a human being'.\n\nDespite being viewed by many of the Discworld's more Machiavellian power brokers as easy to fool, Vimes is more cunning than he appears. His years of practical experience give him a foundation of hard-headed realism on which he bases much of his more idealistic beliefs. A running gag in the series is his thwarting of several attempts on his life by the [[Ankh-Morpork Assassins' Guild|Assassins' Guild]], due to his knowledge of their rigid code of conduct. Thanks to the funds now available to him, through marriage, his mansion is set with numerous traps, so that the Assassins, who must always offer a sporting chance, cannot get close to him without suffering a severe mishap. Traps include roof tiles set on greased rails, sawn roof joists over the dragon pens and bear traps in the shrubbery. Vimes also personally makes sure that all of the brickwork is kept in good repair, with no convenient handholds.  In addition, Vimes' office at Pseudopolis Yard has \"everything that his ingenuity could devise\", including sharp ornamental railings, \"which are pretty, and make the house look nice, but are, above all, spiky.\"\n\nWhenever he thwarts an Assassin in an attempt, he usually lets them go after taking their share of the payment for his inhumation (which he then donates to the 'Watch Widows and Orphans Fund', or to the 'Sunshine Sanctuary for Sick, Abused or Abandoned Dragons'), and subjecting them to a little humiliation. Though he finds it to be annoying, Vimes takes these continued attempts on his life as a sign that he's angering somebody, and so must be doing something right. In every book in the series, the fee for his assassination has risen until he has been removed from the Guild register, meaning that contracts on his life are no longer accepted (this was initially literal, as no assassin wanted to take the contract).<ref name=\"Night Watch page 8\">''[[Night Watch (Discworld)|Night Watch]]'', page 8, {{ISBN|0-385-60264-2}}</ref> Vimes was made aware of this by a young female student from the guild, who had been tasked with merely getting a glimpse of Vimes at his home (after she had fallen into one of the \"eventually lethal\" traps). Vimes is considering appealing the decision.<ref>''[[Night Watch (Discworld)|Night Watch]]'', page 10, {{ISBN|0-385-60264-2}}</ref> In ''[[The Fifth Elephant]]'', Vimes managed to evade, fight off, and 'kill' part of a pack of [[Werewolf|werewolves]] in \"the game\", a werewolf tradition of chasing a human back to civilization that humans did not often win. ([[Ankh-Morpork City Watch#Captain Angua von .C3.9Cberwald|Angua]]'s brother Wolfgang denies that the werewolves died, as they can only truly be killed by silver; they would just have \"nasty headaches later on.\") Vimes also reflects on killing a werewolf in ''Night Watch''<ref name=\"Night Watch page 8\" /> and Vetinari mentions him killing a werewolf in ''Thud!''.<ref name=\"thud\" /> He eventually did actually kill Wolfgang (with a firework, it having been previously established that werewolves can be killed by fire as well as silver.)\n\nWhile not otherwise well-traveled, in the days of ''[[Guards! Guards!]]'' he could tell exactly where he was anywhere within the city limits of Ankh-Morpork just by the feel of the [[cobbles]] beneath his feet, due to the thinness of his boots at the time, having walked the streets of the city for thirty years and a knowledge of the difference of the cobbles therein. When he is returned to the past in ''[[Night Watch (Discworld)|Night Watch]]'', he uses this ability to locate a group of monks he needs in order to return to his present. Later in the series, the expensive, good quality boots his wife persists in buying for him restrict this ability.\n\nVimes' firm grasp of basic human nature, and of the Ankh-Morpork psyche in particular, led to him spending some years as a drunk, and [[Ankh-Morpork City Watch#Sergeant Fred Colon|Sergeant Fred Colon]] postulates that this was because Vimes' body didn't produce any \"natural alcohol\", and he estimates that Vimes was about \"two drinks below par\".<ref>''[[Men at Arms]]'', page 215, {{ISBN|0-552-14028-7}}</ref> This meant that when he hadn't been drinking, he was beyond sober - he was \"[[knurd#Knurd|knurd]]\". Thus he saw reality as it really was (\"[[Witches (Discworld)|first sight]]\"); stripped of all the mental illusions that most people construct in their minds to get to sleep at night (\"second sight\"). This horrifying state of mind caused Vimes to try to balance it out through drinking, but he would get the dosage wrong and would just end up drunk. Vimes gave up alcohol after his marriage to Sybil, and now smokes foul-smelling cigars instead. He still keeps a bottle of 'Bearhugger's Whisky' in his bottom desk drawer as a 'permanent test'.\n\nTerry Pratchett noted the following about Vimes on Usenet: \"Vimes is fundamentally a person. He fears he may be a bad person because he knows what he thinks rather than just what he says and does. He chokes off those little reactions and impulses, but he knows what they are. So he tries to act like a good person, often in situations where the map is unclear.\"[http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.sf.written/browse_thread/thread/a5de20423da837a5/acfb8cc6c17a4e7b?lnk=st&rnum=2#acfb8cc6c17a4e7b] This, along with the Discworld habit of pushing any theory as hard as it goes, appears to have culminated in Vimes' psyche creating its own 'internal policeman' to \"Guard the Guardsmen\", (cf. ''[[Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?]]''), and Vimes' own sense of justice being so strong that, in [[Thud!]], it was even able to fend off the attempts to possess him by a 'quasi-demonic ''thing'' of pure vengeance'.<ref>''[[Thud!]]'', page 328, {{ISBN|0-385-60867-5}}</ref>\n\nVimes often has to go to report to Lord [[Havelock Vetinari|Vetinari]], although most of the time he keeps a poker-face and answers very simply to avoid Vetinari's probing questions. When given bad news, he has a tendency to, on his way out, pound his fist against a certain spot of wall near the office door. Though he sometimes has to call in a plasterer when Vimes is particularly angry, Vetinari doesn't worry about it\u2014a sign that he intentionally angers Vimes so as to goad him into a desired action. When Vimes was temporarily relieved of command in ''[[Men At Arms]]'', the fact that Vimes ''didn't'' pound the wall led Vetinari to realize that he 'may have gone too far'.\n\nIt has also been noted that, in personality and mental setup, Vimes bears some similarity to [[Granny Weatherwax]]. Both are effectively 'good' characters, who nevertheless both secretly fear the darkness inside themselves, and constantly strive to control the darker sides of their nature.\n\nSometimes this darker side comes out when Vimes loses control of his anger and he effectively '[[rage (emotion)|goes spare]]'. In ''[[Men at Arms]]'', he temporarily gains possession of the [[Technology of the Discworld#Gonne|Gonne]], a malevolent firearm which drives him to violence, but he restrains the urge to \"make things right\", enough to eventually let it go without seriously hurting anyone. In ''[[Feet of Clay (novel)|Feet of Clay]]'', Corporal Nobby Nobbs refuses the position of King of Ankh-Morpork, primarily due to the fear of incurring Vimes's general wrath and hatred of royalty.\n\nIn ''[[Thud!]]'', after an attempted assassination of his family, Vimes becomes furious at the 'deep-down dwarves', a problem only made worse by the presence of a dark entity of pure vengeance within his mind. Both of those factors, and a near-Death experience that forced him to miss his 6:00pm story-time with his son, culminate in him snapping and temporarily losing over to \"the Beast\", going insane/berserk and single-handedly storming the deep-downers responsible, all the while roaring out the lines to ''[[Where's My Cow?]]''; (\"...IS THAT MY COW? IT GOES, 'MOOOOO!'...\") with such ferocity and madness that their personal guard come to the conclusion that \"they had sworn to fight to the death, but not to ''this'' death,\" and run away. As he is about to massacre the now-defenceless deep-downers, he hesitates thanks to \"the Watchman\" in his head and begins to struggle with himself, which buys enough time for Sergeant Angua to arrive at the scene and force him down. He never completely loses control, and always manages to restrain himself (or have someone around to restrain him) in the end.\n\nRevealed in the events of ''[[Thud!]]'', after years of night-time patrols, Vimes' mindscape is described as the city of [[Ankh-Morpork]]-itself, streets and all, in the dead of night, whilst the rains are bucketing down over your head. Whenever Vimes is angry, doors of some of the houses open (the more angry he is, the more numbers of doors will open). While the ''Summoning Dark'' had trespassed into his mind, needing a host in order to track down the Deep-Downer Dwarves, would try to enter through one of the doors that opened when Vimes became angry, only to be pulled away at every time. It is later revealed that the force that was preventing the ''Summoning Dark'' from making any progress in possessing Vimes was Vimes' own 'inner guardsman', who patrols the streets of his mind.\n\nVimes is an effective and brutal hand-to-hand fighter, who specialises in \"dirty fighting\". He also prefers non-lethal takedowns whenever possible.\n\nDuring heightened states of mind, such as when confronting his darker side and/or when near death, he is able to see [[Death (Discworld)|Death]], (this happened in ''[[The Fifth Elephant]]'' and ''[[Thud!]]'', although he was unable to do this in ''[[Night Watch (Discworld)|Night Watch]]''). Death himself is unsure whether Vimes should die or not in these cases, citing \"[[quantum]]\" as an explanation.  At one point Death notes that if Vimes is having a [[Near-death experience|'near-Death' experience]], Death is also forced to have a 'near Vimes' experience (as of ''[[Thud!]]'' Death has started bringing books to read during these occasions).\n\nOn rare occasions, Sam Vimes has been described as completely happy, even if it's only for a brief period; such occasions include alone time with his wife, the birth of his son, and whenever a case has reached a satisfactory conclusion. At the end of the events of ''[[Dipping tobacco|Snuff]]'', Vimes was also genuinely amazed to learn that a new book, \"''[[Pride and Prejudice|Pride and Extreme Prejudice]]''\", had been dedicated to him.\n\n==Lady Sybil==\n'''Lady Sybil  Vimes''' (full title: [[Grace (style)|Her Grace]], The [[Duchess]] of Ankh, [[Lady]] Sybil Deidre Olgivanna Vimes ([[Married and maiden names|n\u00e9e]] Ramkin)), is Vimes's [[wife]], whom he married at the end of ''[[Men at Arms]]''. First introduced in ''[[Guards! Guards!]]'', she is a rather imposing [[Wagnerian]] [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]], but also a kind-hearted and compassionate person, embodying the positive aspects of aristocrats, who are otherwise depicted unflatteringly in Ankh-Morpork's population. She is deeply gracious and able to like almost anyone (even ''Nobby Nobbs''). She donated a property, Pseudopolis Yard, (bought by her father), to the Watch after their original headquarters was burnt by a dragon.\n\nShe was born into the wealthiest family in [[Ankh-Morpork]] and resides in the most select part of Ankh, Scoone Avenue. As well as being an amateur [[soprano]], she is a leading expert in swamp dragons and has a dragon pen outside her house where she breeds and cares for swamp dragons, though aside from her hobby most of her house is vaguely under-tended due to apparent lack of interest. She also supports ''The Sunshine [[Sanctuary]] For Sick, Abused Or Abandoned Swamp Dragons'', which is run by her friend Rosie Devant-Molei.<ref>T. Pratchett, ''Guards! Guards!'' (1990), p.403</ref> Her [[hobby]] has left her with her natural hair singed off and she wears a [[wig]] in nearly all circumstances. Despite her high-class upbringing, she has displayed a resourcefulness (\"''in an outdoorsy kind of way''\") that first attracted Vimes's attention. \n \nThe pattern of Sam and Sybil's marriage was set the moment he turned away from his wedding to chase an assassin who had just made an attempt on the Patrician's life. Lady Sybil is a remarkably patient woman; she spent nearly the entirety of ''[[The Fifth Elephant]]'' attempting to inform her increasingly distracted husband that she was pregnant with their first child. Though he finds being affectionate in public embarrassing and is divided on disliking Sybil's status as a noble, it is clear that Vimes loves his wife dearly; indeed when he was [[Night Watch (Pratchett novel)|trapped in the past]] alone in a world he no longer recognised, the [[History Monks]] gave him a silver cigar case his wife had bought him to inspire him to continue with his mission. It is unclear if his hatred of crime and the evil of humanity is greater than his love for his wife. Sybil bears this divided loyalty with some grace; nearly every Watch novel concludes with Sam making some form of amends to his neglected wife, either a delayed honeymoon, or simply time alone with their new baby.\n\nIn spite (or perhaps ''because'') of her wealth, Sybil's engages in certain 'housewife'-like activities such as repairing socks and preparing meals. This is mainly out of a sense of duty and tradition than actual need or skill. Sam is somewhat baffled by the overtures, but as he is already used to an imperfect lifestyle, he is generally appreciative of the sentiment.\n\nSybil maintains a number of close (female) social contacts from her schooldays, which, thanks to the kind of school she went to (The [[Quirm College for Young Ladies]]), are now all strategically placed in the highest levels of power across the [[Sto Plains]] and often more powerful than Ankh-Morpork Guild leaders. Vimes once conjectures that if they so conspired, they could run the world, if they don't already do so.\n\nSybil tries her utmost to get Sam to take some time off in almost every book, but for the most part, Sam finds an excuse to stay on the job. In ''[[Snuff (Pratchett novel)|Snuff]]'', Sybil forces Vimes to take a vacation to their countryside estate, Crundells.  The character of one of her [[ancestor]]s, \"''Mad Jack''\" Ramkin, was inspired from [[Mad Jack Fuller|John \"Mad Jack\" Fuller]] of [[Sussex]] (&/or [[John Mytton|John \"Mad Jack\" Mytton]] of [[Shropshire]]).\n\n==Vimes as Duke of Ankh==\nVimes' involvement in preventing a pointless war with [[Klatch]] in the novel ''[[Jingo (novel)|Jingo]]'' led to his being once more rewarded with an unwanted title, in this case, Duke of Ankh. He now finds himself in the awkward position of continuing to despise the ruling classes of the city, while actually being a member of them. In the course of his mission to [[\u00dcberwald (Discworld)|\u00dcberwald]] as ambassador, he was disgusted to learn that he was also entitled to be addressed as \"His Excellency\", although he has used it for clout in places where his status as a police officer is moot.\n\nHis role as Duke of Ankh largely involves diplomacy (his visit to \u00dcberwald in ''The Fifth Elephant'' for example), and his rough and ready upbringing has given him an obliquely effective approach to this field. For instance, he once threatened to personally send an opposing diplomat \"''home in an ambulance''\" for parading his troops near Ankh-Morpork borders, an act that caused the man to order an ''immediate'' withdrawal so drastic that [[Havelock Vetinari]] remarked \"''they were nearly in the next country over.''\" Despite having competent subordinates, including [[Police captain|Captain]]s Carrot and [[Ankh-Morpork City Watch#Captain Angua von .C3.9Cberwald|Angua]] and [[Sergeant]] [[Detritus (Discworld)|Detritus]], Vimes finds it difficult to delegate, and is frustrated by the fact that the growth of the Watch has left him with less and less time for actual boots-on-the-pavement policing. In some ways he found it a relief when, in ''Night Watch'', he was transported back to the Ankh-Morpork of his youth, and became a [[sergeant-at-arms]] in the inefficient, paperwork-free and moderately corrupt Watch of that time.<ref>''[[Night Watch (Discworld)|Night Watch]]'', page 104, {{ISBN|0-385-60264-2}}</ref>\n\n==Young Sam==\nYoung Sam (full title: [[The Honourable|The Hon]]. Samuel \"''Young Sam''\" Vimes II) is Sam and Sybil Vimes' son and only child; he was born at the end of the events in ''Night Watch'', is about fourteen months old by the time of ''[[Thud!]]'', and at the age of six years by the time of the events of ''[[Snuff (Pratchett novel)|Snuff]]''. His birth was difficult, and Vimes paid [[Ankh-Morpork City Watch#John \"Mossy\" Lawn|Doctor \"Mossy\" Lawn]] a large sum of money in gratitude for saving Sybil's and the baby's lives. Lawn has since founded the Lady Sybil Free Hospital.\n\nSince his son's birth, Vimes discovered a new cause in life: arriving at home every day at six o' clock sharp to read ''[[Where's My Cow?]]'' to him, an obligation that supersedes crime, conspiracy or international negotiations&mdash;his thinking being that if he ever missed it for a good reason, he might miss it for a bad reason, and that this might apply to everything he does, such as employing less-than-[[Ethics|ethical]] methods in the pursuit of crime.<ref name=\"thud\">''[[Thud!]]''</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Snuff (Pratchett novel)|Snuff]]'', it is highlighted that not only can Young Sam read, but that he is quite advanced and now reads to his father.  It is also shown that he is currently quite stuck on the study of poo, having read many books written by one Miss Felicity Beedle, whom he knows as \"''the poo lady''\", and who has also written such books as ''Where's My Cow?'', ''The World of Poo'', ''Melvin and the Enormous Boil'', ''Geoffrey and the Magic Pillow Case'' and ''The Little Duckling Who Thought He Was an Elephant''.\n\n==Vimes \"Boots\" Theory of Economic Injustice==\nAt the time of Men at Arms, Samuel Vimes earned thirty-eight dollars a month as a Captain of the Watch, plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots, the sort that would last years and years, cost fifty dollars. This was beyond his pocket and the most he could hope for was an affordable pair of boots costing ten dollars, which might with luck last a year or so before he would need to resort to makeshift cardboard insoles so as to prolong the moment of shelling out another ten dollars.\n\nTherefore over a period of ten years, he might have paid out a hundred dollars on boots, twice as much as the man who could afford fifty dollars up front ten years before. And he would still have wet feet.\n\nWithout any special rancour, Vimes stretched this theory to explain why Sybil Ramkin lived twice as comfortably as he did by spending about half as much every month.<ref name=Boots>[https://wiki.lspace.org/mediawiki/Sam_Vimes_Theory_of_Economic_Injustice The Sam Vimes \"Boots\" Theory of Economic Injustice]</ref>\n\n==Recent developments==\nVimes is, much to his own horror, becoming a politician. He remains in his soul a copper. Being a significant figure on the world stage just means he finds bigger crimes.\n\nVimes has seen involvement with: \n* William de Worde, Otto Chriek and ''The Ankh-Morpork Times'' in ''[[The Truth (novel)|The Truth]]''\n* The war between [[Borogravia]] and Zlobenia (and everyone else in the region) in ''[[Monstrous Regiment (novel)|Monstrous Regiment]]''\n* With [[Moist von Lipwig]] in his running of the Post Office and the Grand Trunk Company's monopoly on the \"[[Clacks (Discworld)|clacks]]\" system in ''[[Going Postal]]'' and fraud involving the Royal Bank of Ankh-Morpork in ''[[Making Money]]''\n* Ethnic tensions between dwarfs and trolls in ''[[Thud!]]''\n* Ethnic tensions between humans and goblins in ''[[Snuff (Pratchett novel)|Snuff]]''\n* Tensions between dwarf factions over the Clacks and the new [[Railway]] in ''[[Raising Steam]]''\n\nTerry Pratchett commented that the Vimes character made setting a story in Ankh-Morpork very difficult as it is almost impossible to create a story involving any sort of crime or politics without it rapidly becoming a Watch book.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}\n\n==Bibliography==\nSam Vimes is the central character in ''[[Guards!

Vimes is depicted in the novels as somewhere between an [[Inspector Morse]]-type 'old-school' British policeman, and a film noir-esque grizzled detective. His appearances throughout the Discworld sequence show him slowly and grudgingly rising through the ranks of both police force and society. As of his latest promotion, his full name and title is: \"''[[Grace (style)|His Grace]], [[Excellency|His Excellency]], The [[Duke]] of Ankh; [[Commander]] [[Sir]] Samuel Vimes''\":  When serving as [[Ambassador]] for Ankh-Morpork, he is also referred to simply as \"''His Excellency''\", and is also nicknamed \"''[[Blackboard]] [[Hall monitor|Monitor]] Vimes''\",<ref>''[[The Fifth Elephant]]'', {{ISBN|0-552-14616-1}}</ref> \"Vimes the Butcher/Butcher Vimes\"<ref>''[[Monstrous Regiment (novel)|Monstrous Regiment]]'', {{ISBN|0-385-60340-1}}</ref> and \"''[[Havelock Vetinari|Vetinari's]] Terrier''\" (or his ''hammer'', depending upon the occasion):  According to his wife, [[#Lady Sybil|Sybil]], Vimes is recognised by many as Lord Vetinari's right-hand man.\n\nHe first appeared in the novel ''[[Guards! Guards!]]''.  While no detailed description of his physical appearance shows up in any of the Discworld novels, Pratchett says in the companion work, ''[[The Art of Discworld]]'', that he has always imagined Vimes as a younger, slightly bulkier version of late British actor [[Pete Postlethwaite]]. Longtime collaborative artist [[Paul Kidby]], who has worked with Pratchett on several works, portrays him instead as resembling [[Clint Eastwood]].\n\nVimes is the Commander of the [[Ankh-Morpork City Watch|City Watch]], the burgeoning police force of the [[Discworld (world)|Discworld's]] largest city, [[Ankh-Morpork]]. His rise from drunk policeman to respected member of the [[aristocracy]], and the simultaneous growth and development of the Watch under his command, have together been one of the major threads of the ''Discworld'' series. Born into poverty, (as a descendant of disgraced ancient Ankh-Morpork nobility), he is now a highly reluctant member of modern Ankh-Morpork [[nobility]], having been made both a [[knight]] and a [[duke]], as well as an ambassador. He is married to Sybil Ramkin, the richest woman in the city. They have a son, [[Sam Vimes#Young Sam|The Honourable Samuel Vimes II]].\n\n==Works==\nBeginning with ''Guards! Guards!'' in 1989, the main Discworld books featuring Sam Vimes are:\n*''[[Guards! Guards!]]'' \u2013 1989\n*''[[Men At Arms]]'' \u2013 1993\n*''[[Feet of Clay (novel)|Feet of Clay]]'' \u2013 1996\n*''[[Jingo (novel)|Jingo]]'' \u2013 1997\n*''[[The Fifth Elephant]]'' \u2013 1999\n*''[[The Truth (novel)|The Truth]]'' \u2013 2000 (minor character)\n*''[[Night Watch (Discworld)|Night Watch]]'' \u2013 2002\n*''[[Monstrous Regiment (novel)|Monstrous Regiment]]'' \u2013 2003 (minor character)\n*''[[Thud!]]'' \u2013 2005\n*''[[Where's My Cow|Where's My Cow?]]'' \u2013 2005\n*''[[Making Money]]'' \u2013 2007 (minor character)\n*''[[Unseen Academicals]]'' \u2013 2009 (minor character)\n*''[[Snuff (Pratchett novel)|Snuff]]'' \u2013 2011\n*''[[Raising Steam]]'' \u2013 2013 (supporting character)\n\n==Background==\nSam Vimes was born in Cockbill Street as the son of Thomas Vimes,<ref name=\"FOC\">''[[Feet of Clay (novel)|Feet of Clay]]'', page 36, {{ISBN|0-575-05900-1}}</ref> (son of Gwilliam Vimes)<ref name=\"FOC\"/> in the Rimwards part of the Shades, the poorest area of Ankh-Morpork. It is depicted as being so poor that there was little crime, though Sam was part of a street gang (''The Cockbill Street Roaring Lads'') with [[Discworld characters#Lupine Wonse|Lupine Wonse]] (who later became secretary to [[Havelock Vetinari|Lord Vetinari]]).\n\nVimes was educated at a [[dame school]], where he was once blackboard monitor for a whole term, before he had to drop out and concentrate on learning about life out on the streets.  It is mentioned in ''[[Jingo (novel)|Jingo]]'' that Sam Vimes' father, Thomas Vimes, had been a [[Watchman (law enforcement)|watchman]] prior to his death.  His mother would go on to tell young Sam that his father was 'run down by a cart when he was crossing the street':<ref name=\"nightwatch\">''[[Night Watch (Discworld)|Night Watch]]'', page 150, {{ISBN|0-385-60264-2}}</ref> He privately reckons later that his father was a drunk: ''Vimes had never known his father.  His mum told him that the man had been run over by a cart, but Vimes suspected that if this were true at all, then it was probably a brewer's cart, which had [[Alcoholism|'run him over' a bit at a time for years]]''.  Whatever happened to him exactly, she raised the young Sam on her own.  She died some point between the events of the \"''Glorious 25th of May''\" (she was alive during the events of ''Night Watch'') and ten years prior to the \"present-day\" events in that novel (before Vimes' first appearance in ''[[Guards! Guards!]]''), and is buried in the city's Small Gods Cemetery. In ''[[Night Watch (Discworld)|Night Watch]]'' Sam remembers that his mother had a particular skill at making Distressed Pudding.<ref>Night Watch, page 198, {{ISBN|0-385-60264-2}}</ref>\n\nThe Vimes family has historically been closely linked with the City Watch, with many members serving in it through its history.<ref name=\"FOC\"/> It has been suggested that Sam's father was a watchman in ''[[Jingo (novel)|Jingo]]'' and he is a [[Lineal descendant|descendant]] of Suffer-Not-Injustice \"Old Stoneface\" Vimes, the Watch [[Commander]] who instigated the rebellion against, and subsequently beheaded, Lorenzo the Kind, the last king of the city, a sadistic [[torturer]] described as \"[[pedophilia|very fond of children]].\" As a consequence, the Vimes family was stripped of its nobility. For three centuries afterwards, the memory of \"Old Stoneface\" has lived on in infamy and, as his descendant, Vimes has frequently endured suspicious mutterings from the aristocracy.  Vimes is implied to heavily resemble his ancestor<ref>''[[Feet of Clay (novel)|Feet of Clay]]'', page 37, {{ISBN|0-575-05900-1}}</ref> and they share a nickname: ''Old Stoneface''. ''The Annotated Pratchett File'' notes that Suffer-Not-Injustice Vimes is closely modelled on [[Oliver Cromwell]], and that the name of his supporters, the Ironheads, is a [[portmanteau]] of [[Roundheads]] and [[Ironside (cavalry)|Ironsides]], Cromwell's faction and regiment, respectively.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Annotated Pratchett File: Feet of Clay|work=l-space.org|url=http://www.lspace.org/books/apf/feet-of-clay.html|accessdate=2007-07-07}}</ref>\n\nVimes was sixteen when he joined the Watch.<ref name=\"nightwatch\" /> He was part of that section of the Watch which played a large role in the rebellion against [[Discworld characters#Lord Winder|Homicidal Lord Winder]]. It was around this time he was taught all he knew by [[Serjeant-at-Arms|Sergeant-At-Arms]] John Keel, which is where his cynical outlook on life and his firm belief in justice comes from.<ref name=\"nightwatch\" />\nIn the newest stories, Keel is [[ontological paradox|Vimes himself transported back in time]] by thirty years. As [[Lu-Tze]] explains to Vimes in ''Night Watch'', both pasts are true and there was a real John Keel. Vimes was transported back in time in the company of a criminal named Carcer, whom he was trying to apprehend. Carcer robbed and killed the real John Keel, and Vimes had to replace him in order for his role in history to be fulfilled.\n\nVimes' age is never explicitly given, and information is not always consistent. ''[[Night Watch (Discworld)|Night Watch]]'' states that Vimes was sixteen years old when he joined the City Watch. It is mentioned in ''[[Men at Arms]]'' that Vimes has been in the Watch for 25 years, making him 41 at the time of that novel. The main events of ''Night Watch'', set only a few weeks after Vimes joined the Watch, are stated as occurring more than thirty years prior to the present from which Vimes came, this makes Samuel Vimes at least 46 years old at the time of the events of that book. ''[[Thud!]]'' gives the age of Vimes' son, (also named Sam), born during the climax of ''Night Watch'', as being fourteen months,<ref>''[[Thud!]]'', page 124, {{ISBN|0-385-60867-5}}</ref> which would put Vimes at a minimum of 47 or 48 years old during the events of the book. When Vimes discusses his time as a blackboard monitor,<ref>''[[Thud!]]'', pages 79-80, {{ISBN|0-385-60867-5}}</ref> he thinks about it being \"more than 45 years ago\" and that he was six years old at the time, putting his age at least 51 years; this is confirmed when he refers to the new vampire officer, age given as 51, as being \"not that much younger than him\". It is also mentioned in ''Night Watch'', that at the time of the \"Glorious Revolution of the Twenty-Fifth of May\", both Sam Vimes and Havelock Vetinari were 16 years old, meaning that they are both the same age.\n\n==The Watch==\nDuring the first 25 years of his term in the Watch, Vimes rose to Captain of the Night Watch, a position that he attained about ten years prior to the events of ''[[Guards! Guards!]]'', as it dwindled to a tiny stub &ndash; while the power of the Thieves' Guild grew. This insult to Vimes' sense of justice, together with his being naturally knurd (the opposite of being drunk, where one is stripped of all the illusions that make life bearable) and other events (it has been claimed he was \"''brung low by a woman''\", which is an interpretation of the [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphisation]] of the city, [[Britannia|Morporkia]]), led towards heavy drinking. At this time, he lived in near poverty, giving away almost all of his salary to widows and orphans of watchmen, and spending what was left on alcohol and cheap boots.<ref>Men At Arms, {{ISBN|0552140287}}</ref>\n\nAll that changed when [[Ankh-Morpork City Watch#Captain Carrot Ironfoundersson|Carrot Ironfoundersson]] came to the city. A human raised by [[Dwarfs (Discworld)|dwarves]], Carrot joined the Watch and set out to help the city. Around the same time, a [[European dragon|dragon]] assaulted the city, and the Watch was instrumental in its defeat. The whole series of events forced Vimes to [[Sobriety|sober]]-up long enough to uncover [[Discworld characters#Lupine Wonse|who was responsible for summoning the Dragon]], after which the [[#Lady Sybil|changes in his personal life]] led to him coming off of the drink and switching to [[smoking]] [[cigars]], and occasionally, taking [[Dipping tobacco|snuff]].\n\nThe Watch was given a new headquarters, Pseudopolis Yard (an allusion to the name of the headquarters of London's Metropolitan Police: [[Scotland Yard]]), by Lady Sybil Ramkin (Vimes's soon-to-be wife) after the dragon destroyed their original base at Treacle Mine Road. It had been her childhood home, and in ''[[Thud!]]'' it is revealed that some of her family's possessions are still stored in the attic of the building &ndash; in this instance they retrieved a copy of Methodia Rascal's Koom Valley painting, made by Sybil as a child, after the original is stolen.\n\nAs part of an equal-opportunities drive required by the Patrician, the Night Watch under Vimes eventually took on extra staff in the form of a werewolf, a dwarf and a [[Troll (Discworld)|troll]] (and later a gargoyle, a gnome, a golem, an [[Igor (Discworld)|Igor]], a zombie, and a vampire). They were instrumental in foiling an attempt on the Patrician's life, and were rewarded. The Watch was rapidly revived and became increasingly important in the city.\n\nVimes, who was about to retire following his marriage to Lady Sybil, was given the resurrected rank of Commander, putting him in charge of the Night Watch and the Day Watch. He also received a [[knight]]hood.\n\nVimes took a great interest in the restructuring of the Watch, placing new Watch Houses where they were needed and supervising the creation of both a Watch Academy and a [[forensics]] section. His reform of the City Watch has been so successful that by ''Night Watch'', Vimes-trained policemen are in high demand in cities across the Disc. They are known as ''Sammies'' (which is based on the British terms for [[police officer]]s, ''[[Bobbies]]'' and, the now obsolete, ''Peelers'' both after [[Robert Peel]] and possibly on the earlier term \"Charleys\" for night watchmen, after Charles II during whose reign they were instituted), even to the people who may have never actually heard of Samuel Vimes himself. In his expanding international and diplomatic role, Vimes appreciates the fact that police officers from [[Discworld geography#Sto Lat|Sto Lat]] to [[Discworld geography#Genua|Genua]] have been trained to salute him, and remain in unofficial contact across the Disc.\n\n==Character==\nVimes is a very conflicted character:<ref name=\"nightwatch\"/> An incorruptible [[idealist]] with deep beliefs in justice and an abiding love of his city, he is also a committed [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynic]] whose knowledge of human nature constantly reminds him how far off those ideals are.<ref name=\"nightwatch\"/> A member of the upper classes, he still has an innate dislike of hereditary wealth and an instinctive revulsion towards social inequality. The Patrician observes that Vimes is anti-authoritarian even though he is, himself, an authority figure, which is \"practically [[Zen]]\".<ref>''[[Feet of Clay (novel)|Feet of Clay]]'', page 275, {{ISBN|0-575-05900-1}}</ref> The conflict within Vimes is between his virtuous nature (\"the Watchman\") and what he calls \"the Beast\". In ''[[The Art of Discworld]]'', Pratchett explains that Vimes protects himself from the Beast with the symbol of his own badge, which prevents him from becoming the criminal he despises, at least in his own mind.<ref name=\"thud\"/> Although in ''[[Guards! Guards!]]'' Vimes is all but shocked at Vetinari's disturbingly cynical (and probably disturbingly accurate) view of the world, he in turn has been called \"the most cynical bastard that ever walked under the sun\" (in ''[[I Shall Wear Midnight]]''). Although widely differing characters, Vimes and Vetinari can be called similar in that they both have very cynical worldviews, but fairly idealistic aims.\n\nVimes has once been described as a [[speciesism|speciesist]], though only from an \"old school\" mindset. He will warm up to \"good coppers\", regardless of their unusual backgrounds and has allowed the Watch to become one of the most species-blind employers in the city. Most of his officers rationalize his bias as simply not being particularly fond of ''anyone''; initially, Vimes is jokingly described as fond of rural dwarfs and wizards, primarily because most do not cause crimes relevant to him. A notable exception is his explicit dislike of vampires. He explained to Lady Margolotta in ''[[The Fifth Elephant]]'', this is because, teetotal or not, 'a vampire will always seek to dominate a human being'.\n\nDespite being viewed by many of the Discworld's more Machiavellian power brokers as easy to fool, Vimes is more cunning than he appears. His years of practical experience give him a foundation of hard-headed realism on which he bases much of his more idealistic beliefs. A running gag in the series is his thwarting of several attempts on his life by the [[Ankh-Morpork Assassins' Guild|Assassins' Guild]], due to his knowledge of their rigid code of conduct. Thanks to the funds now available to him, through marriage, his mansion is set with numerous traps, so that the Assassins, who must always offer a sporting chance, cannot get close to him without suffering a severe mishap. Traps include roof tiles set on greased rails, sawn roof joists over the dragon pens and bear traps in the shrubbery. Vimes also personally makes sure that all of the brickwork is kept in good repair, with no convenient handholds.  In addition, Vimes' office at Pseudopolis Yard has \"everything that his ingenuity could devise\", including sharp ornamental railings, \"which are pretty, and make the house look nice, but are, above all, spiky.\"\n\nWhenever he thwarts an Assassin in an attempt, he usually lets them go after taking their share of the payment for his inhumation (which he then donates to the 'Watch Widows and Orphans Fund', or to the 'Sunshine Sanctuary for Sick, Abused or Abandoned Dragons'), and subjecting them to a little humiliation. Though he finds it to be annoying, Vimes takes these continued attempts on his life as a sign that he's angering somebody, and so must be doing something right. In every book in the series, the fee for his assassination has risen until he has been removed from the Guild register, meaning that contracts on his life are no longer accepted (this was initially literal, as no assassin wanted to take the contract).<ref name=\"Night Watch page 8\">''[[Night Watch (Discworld)|Night Watch]]'', page 8, {{ISBN|0-385-60264-2}}</ref> Vimes was made aware of this by a young female student from the guild, who had been tasked with merely getting a glimpse of Vimes at his home (after she had fallen into one of the \"eventually lethal\" traps). Vimes is considering appealing the decision.<ref>''[[Night Watch (Discworld)|Night Watch]]'', page 10, {{ISBN|0-385-60264-2}}</ref> In ''[[The Fifth Elephant]]'', Vimes managed to evade, fight off, and 'kill' part of a pack of [[Werewolf|werewolves]] in \"the game\", a werewolf tradition of chasing a human back to civilization that humans did not often win. ([[Ankh-Morpork City Watch#Captain Angua von .C3.9Cberwald|Angua]]'s brother Wolfgang denies that the werewolves died, as they can only truly be killed by silver; they would just have \"nasty headaches later on.\") Vimes also reflects on killing a werewolf in ''Night Watch''<ref name=\"Night Watch page 8\" /> and Vetinari mentions him killing a werewolf in ''Thud!''.<ref name=\"thud\" /> He eventually did actually kill Wolfgang (with a firework, it having been previously established that werewolves can be killed by fire as well as silver.)\n\nWhile not otherwise well-traveled, in the days of ''[[Guards! Guards!]]'' he could tell exactly where he was anywhere within the city limits of Ankh-Morpork just by the feel of the [[cobbles]] beneath his feet, due to the thinness of his boots at the time, having walked the streets of the city for thirty years and a knowledge of the difference of the cobbles therein. When he is returned to the past in ''[[Night Watch (Discworld)|Night Watch]]'', he uses this ability to locate a group of monks he needs in order to return to his present. Later in the series, the expensive, good quality boots his wife persists in buying for him restrict this ability.\n\nVimes' firm grasp of basic human nature, and of the Ankh-Morpork psyche in particular, led to him spending some years as a drunk, and [[Ankh-Morpork City Watch#Sergeant Fred Colon|Sergeant Fred Colon]] postulates that this was because Vimes' body didn't produce any \"natural alcohol\", and he estimates that Vimes was about \"two drinks below par\".<ref>''[[Men at Arms]]'', page 215, {{ISBN|0-552-14028-7}}</ref> This meant that when he hadn't been drinking, he was beyond sober - he was \"[[knurd#Knurd|knurd]]\". Thus he saw reality as it really was (\"[[Witches (Discworld)|first sight]]\"); stripped of all the mental illusions that most people construct in their minds to get to sleep at night (\"second sight\"). This horrifying state of mind caused Vimes to try to balance it out through drinking, but he would get the dosage wrong and would just end up drunk. Vimes gave up alcohol after his marriage to Sybil, and now smokes foul-smelling cigars instead. He still keeps a bottle of 'Bearhugger's Whisky' in his bottom desk drawer as a 'permanent test'.\n\nTerry Pratchett noted the following about Vimes on Usenet: \"Vimes is fundamentally a person. He fears he may be a bad person because he knows what he thinks rather than just what he says and does. He chokes off those little reactions and impulses, but he knows what they are. So he tries to act like a good person, often in situations where the map is unclear.\"[http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.sf.written/browse_thread/thread/a5de20423da837a5/acfb8cc6c17a4e7b?lnk=st&rnum=2#acfb8cc6c17a4e7b] This, along with the Discworld habit of pushing any theory as hard as it goes, appears to have culminated in Vimes' psyche creating its own 'internal policeman' to \"Guard the Guardsmen\", (cf. ''[[Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?]]''), and Vimes' own sense of justice being so strong that, in [[Thud!]], it was even able to fend off the attempts to possess him by a 'quasi-demonic ''thing'' of pure vengeance'.<ref>''[[Thud!]]'', page 328, {{ISBN|0-385-60867-5}}</ref>\n\nVimes often has to go to report to Lord [[Havelock Vetinari|Vetinari]], although most of the time he keeps a poker-face and answers very simply to avoid Vetinari's probing questions. When given bad news, he has a tendency to, on his way out, pound his fist against a certain spot of wall near the office door. Though he sometimes has to call in a plasterer when Vimes is particularly angry, Vetinari doesn't worry about it\u2014a sign that he intentionally angers Vimes so as to goad him into a desired action. When Vimes was temporarily relieved of command in ''[[Men At Arms]]'', the fact that Vimes ''didn't'' pound the wall led Vetinari to realize that he 'may have gone too far'.\n\nIt has also been noted that, in personality and mental setup, Vimes bears some similarity to [[Granny Weatherwax]]. Both are effectively 'good' characters, who nevertheless both secretly fear the darkness inside themselves, and constantly strive to control the darker sides of their nature.\n\nSometimes this darker side comes out when Vimes loses control of his anger and he effectively '[[rage (emotion)|goes spare]]'. In ''[[Men at Arms]]'', he temporarily gains possession of the [[Technology of the Discworld#Gonne|Gonne]], a malevolent firearm which drives him to violence, but he restrains the urge to \"make things right\", enough to eventually let it go without seriously hurting anyone. In ''[[Feet of Clay (novel)|Feet of Clay]]'', Corporal Nobby Nobbs refuses the position of King of Ankh-Morpork, primarily due to the fear of incurring Vimes's general wrath and hatred of royalty.\n\nIn ''[[Thud!]]'', after an attempted assassination of his family, Vimes becomes furious at the 'deep-down dwarves', a problem only made worse by the presence of a dark entity of pure vengeance within his mind. Both of those factors, and a near-Death experience that forced him to miss his 6:00pm story-time with his son, culminate in him snapping and temporarily losing over to \"the Beast\", going insane/berserk and single-handedly storming the deep-downers responsible, all the while roaring out the lines to ''[[Where's My Cow?]]''; (\"...IS THAT MY COW? IT GOES, 'MOOOOO!'...\") with such ferocity and madness that their personal guard come to the conclusion that \"they had sworn to fight to the death, but not to ''this'' death,\" and run away. As he is about to massacre the now-defenceless deep-downers, he hesitates thanks to \"the Watchman\" in his head and begins to struggle with himself, which buys enough time for Sergeant Angua to arrive at the scene and force him down. He never completely loses control, and always manages to restrain himself (or have someone around to restrain him) in the end.\n\nRevealed in the events of ''[[Thud!]]'', after years of night-time patrols, Vimes' mindscape is described as the city of [[Ankh-Morpork]]-itself, streets and all, in the dead of night, whilst the rains are bucketing down over your head. Whenever Vimes is angry, doors of some of the houses open (the more angry he is, the more numbers of doors will open). While the ''Summoning Dark'' had trespassed into his mind, needing a host in order to track down the Deep-Downer Dwarves, would try to enter through one of the doors that opened when Vimes became angry, only to be pulled away at every time. It is later revealed that the force that was preventing the ''Summoning Dark'' from making any progress in possessing Vimes was Vimes' own 'inner guardsman', who patrols the streets of his mind.\n\nVimes is an effective and brutal hand-to-hand fighter, who specialises in \"dirty fighting\". He also prefers non-lethal takedowns whenever possible.\n\nDuring heightened states of mind, such as when confronting his darker side and/or when near death, he is able to see [[Death (Discworld)|Death]], (this happened in ''[[The Fifth Elephant]]'' and ''[[Thud!]]'', although he was unable to do this in ''[[Night Watch (Discworld)|Night Watch]]''). Death himself is unsure whether Vimes should die or not in these cases, citing \"[[quantum]]\" as an explanation.  At one point Death notes that if Vimes is having a [[Near-death experience|'near-Death' experience]], Death is also forced to have a 'near Vimes' experience (as of ''[[Thud!]]'' Death has started bringing books to read during these occasions).\n\nOn rare occasions, Sam Vimes has been described as completely happy, even if it's only for a brief period; such occasions include alone time with his wife, the birth of his son, and whenever a case has reached a satisfactory conclusion. At the end of the events of ''[[Dipping tobacco|Snuff]]'', Vimes was also genuinely amazed to learn that a new book, \"''[[Pride and Prejudice|Pride and Extreme Prejudice]]''\", had been dedicated to him.\n\n==Lady Sybil==\n'''Lady Sybil  Vimes''' (full title: [[Grace (style)|Her Grace]], The [[Duchess]] of Ankh, [[Lady]] Sybil Deidre Olgivanna Vimes ([[Married and maiden names|n\u00e9e]] Ramkin)), is Vimes's [[wife]], whom he married at the end of ''[[Men at Arms]]''. First introduced in ''[[Guards! Guards!]]'', she is a rather imposing [[Wagnerian]] [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]], but also a kind-hearted and compassionate person, embodying the positive aspects of aristocrats, who are otherwise depicted unflatteringly in Ankh-Morpork's population. She is deeply gracious and able to like almost anyone (even ''Nobby Nobbs''). She donated a property, Pseudopolis Yard, (bought by her father), to the Watch after their original headquarters was burnt by a dragon.\n\nShe was born into the wealthiest family in [[Ankh-Morpork]] and resides in the most select part of Ankh, Scoone Avenue. As well as being an amateur [[soprano]], she is a leading expert in swamp dragons and has a dragon pen outside her house where she breeds and cares for swamp dragons, though aside from her hobby most of her house is vaguely under-tended due to apparent lack of interest. She also supports ''The Sunshine [[Sanctuary]] For Sick, Abused Or Abandoned Swamp Dragons'', which is run by her friend Rosie Devant-Molei.<ref>T. Pratchett, ''Guards! Guards!'' (1990), p.403</ref> Her [[hobby]] has left her with her natural hair singed off and she wears a [[wig]] in nearly all circumstances. Despite her high-class upbringing, she has displayed a resourcefulness (\"''in an outdoorsy kind of way''\") that first attracted Vimes's attention. \n \nThe pattern of Sam and Sybil's marriage was set the moment he turned away from his wedding to chase an assassin who had just made an attempt on the Patrician's life. Lady Sybil is a remarkably patient woman; she spent nearly the entirety of ''[[The Fifth Elephant]]'' attempting to inform her increasingly distracted husband that she was pregnant with their first child. Though he finds being affectionate in public embarrassing and is divided on disliking Sybil's status as a noble, it is clear that Vimes loves his wife dearly; indeed when he was [[Night Watch (Pratchett novel)|trapped in the past]] alone in a world he no longer recognised, the [[History Monks]] gave him a silver cigar case his wife had bought him to inspire him to continue with his mission. It is unclear if his hatred of crime and the evil of humanity is greater than his love for his wife. Sybil bears this divided loyalty with some grace; nearly every Watch novel concludes with Sam making some form of amends to his neglected wife, either a delayed honeymoon, or simply time alone with their new baby.\n\nIn spite (or perhaps ''because'') of her wealth, Sybil's engages in certain 'housewife'-like activities such as repairing socks and preparing meals. This is mainly out of a sense of duty and tradition than actual need or skill. Sam is somewhat baffled by the overtures, but as he is already used to an imperfect lifestyle, he is generally appreciative of the sentiment.\n\nSybil maintains a number of close (female) social contacts from her schooldays, which, thanks to the kind of school she went to (The [[Quirm College for Young Ladies]]), are now all strategically placed in the highest levels of power across the [[Sto Plains]] and often more powerful than Ankh-Morpork Guild leaders. Vimes once conjectures that if they so conspired, they could run the world, if they don't already do so.\n\nSybil tries her utmost to get Sam to take some time off in almost every book, but for the most part, Sam finds an excuse to stay on the job. In ''[[Snuff (Pratchett novel)|Snuff]]'', Sybil forces Vimes to take a vacation to their countryside estate, Crundells.  The character of one of her [[ancestor]]s, \"''Mad Jack''\" Ramkin, was inspired from [[Mad Jack Fuller|John \"Mad Jack\" Fuller]] of [[Sussex]] (&/or [[John Mytton|John \"Mad Jack\" Mytton]] of [[Shropshire]]).\n\n==Vimes as Duke of Ankh==\nVimes' involvement in preventing a pointless war with [[Klatch]] in the novel ''[[Jingo (novel)|Jingo]]'' led to his being once more rewarded with an unwanted title, in this case, Duke of Ankh. He now finds himself in the awkward position of continuing to despise the ruling classes of the city, while actually being a member of them. In the course of his mission to [[\u00dcberwald (Discworld)|\u00dcberwald]] as ambassador, he was disgusted to learn that he was also entitled to be addressed as \"His Excellency\", although he has used it for clout in places where his status as a police officer is moot.\n\nHis role as Duke of Ankh largely involves diplomacy (his visit to \u00dcberwald in ''The Fifth Elephant'' for example), and his rough and ready upbringing has given him an obliquely effective approach to this field. For instance, he once threatened to personally send an opposing diplomat \"''home in an ambulance''\" for parading his troops near Ankh-Morpork borders, an act that caused the man to order an ''immediate'' withdrawal so drastic that [[Havelock Vetinari]] remarked \"''they were nearly in the next country over.''\" Despite having competent subordinates, including [[Police captain|Captain]]s Carrot and [[Ankh-Morpork City Watch#Captain Angua von .C3.9Cberwald|Angua]] and [[Sergeant]] [[Detritus (Discworld)|Detritus]], Vimes finds it difficult to delegate, and is frustrated by the fact that the growth of the Watch has left him with less and less time for actual boots-on-the-pavement policing. In some ways he found it a relief when, in ''Night Watch'', he was transported back to the Ankh-Morpork of his youth, and became a [[sergeant-at-arms]] in the inefficient, paperwork-free and moderately corrupt Watch of that time.<ref>''[[Night Watch (Discworld)|Night Watch]]'', page 104, {{ISBN|0-385-60264-2}}</ref>\n\n==Young Sam==\nYoung Sam (full title: [[The Honourable|The Hon]]. Samuel \"''Young Sam''\" Vimes II) is Sam and Sybil Vimes' son and only child; he was born at the end of the events in ''Night Watch'', is about fourteen months old by the time of ''[[Thud!]]'', and at the age of six years by the time of the events of ''[[Snuff (Pratchett novel)|Snuff]]''. His birth was difficult, and Vimes paid [[Ankh-Morpork City Watch#John \"Mossy\" Lawn|Doctor \"Mossy\" Lawn]] a large sum of money in gratitude for saving Sybil's and the baby's lives. Lawn has since founded the Lady Sybil Free Hospital.\n\nSince his son's birth, Vimes discovered a new cause in life: arriving at home every day at six o' clock sharp to read ''[[Where's My Cow?]]'' to him, an obligation that supersedes crime, conspiracy or international negotiations&mdash;his thinking being that if he ever missed it for a good reason, he might miss it for a bad reason, and that this might apply to everything he does, such as employing less-than-[[Ethics|ethical]] methods in the pursuit of crime.<ref name=\"thud\">''[[Thud!]]''</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Snuff (Pratchett novel)|Snuff]]'', it is highlighted that not only can Young Sam read, but that he is quite advanced and now reads to his father.  It is also shown that he is currently quite stuck on the study of poo, having read many books written by one Miss Felicity Beedle, whom he knows as \"''the poo lady''\", and who has also written such books as ''Where's My Cow?'', ''The World of Poo'', ''Melvin and the Enormous Boil'', ''Geoffrey and the Magic Pillow Case'' and ''The Little Duckling Who Thought He Was an Elephant''.\n\n==Vimes \"Boots\" Theory of Economic Injustice==\nAt the time of Men at Arms, Samuel Vimes earned thirty-eight dollars a month as a Captain of the Watch, plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots, the sort that would last years and years, cost fifty dollars. This was beyond his pocket and the most he could hope for was an affordable pair of boots costing ten dollars, which might with luck last a year or so before he would need to resort to makeshift cardboard insoles so as to prolong the moment of shelling out another ten dollars.\n\nTherefore over a period of ten years, he might have paid out a hundred dollars on boots, twice as much as the man who could afford fifty dollars up front ten years before. And he would still have wet feet.\n\nWithout any special rancour, Vimes stretched this theory to explain why Sybil Ramkin lived twice as comfortably as he did by spending about half as much every month.<ref name=\"Boots\">{{https://wiki.lspace.org/mediawiki/Sam_Vimes_Theory_of_Economic_Injustice}}</ref>\n\n==Recent developments==\nVimes is, much to his own horror, becoming a politician. He remains in his soul a copper. Being a significant figure on the world stage just means he finds bigger crimes.\n\nVimes has seen involvement with: \n* William de Worde, Otto Chriek and ''The Ankh-Morpork Times'' in ''[[The Truth (novel)|The Truth]]''\n* The war between [[Borogravia]] and Zlobenia (and everyone else in the region) in ''[[Monstrous Regiment (novel)|Monstrous Regiment]]''\n* With [[Moist von Lipwig]] in his running of the Post Office and the Grand Trunk Company's monopoly on the \"[[Clacks (Discworld)|clacks]]\" system in ''[[Going Postal]]'' and fraud involving the Royal Bank of Ankh-Morpork in ''[[Making Money]]''\n* Ethnic tensions between dwarfs and trolls in ''[[Thud!]]''\n* Ethnic tensions between humans and goblins in ''[[Snuff (Pratchett novel)|Snuff]]''\n* Tensions between dwarf factions over the Clacks and the new [[Railway]] in ''[[Raising Steam]]''\n\nTerry Pratchett commented that the Vimes character made setting a story in Ankh-Morpork very difficult as it is almost impossible to create a story involving any sort of crime or politics without it rapidly becoming a Watch book.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}\n\n==Bibliography==\nSam Vimes is the central character in ''[[Guards!

{"title_page": "Heliciculture", "text_new": "[[File:Eyragues-l-Escargot-des-Alpilles-5738.jpg|thumb|A snail farm near [[Eyragues]], [[Provence]], [[France]]]]\n'''Heliciculture''', commonly known as '''snail farming''', is the process of raising edible [[land snail]]s, primarily for human consumption or cosmetic use. The meat and  [[Snail caviar|snail eggs]] can be consumed as [[escargot]] and as a type of caviar respectively. Mucus, commonly known as [[snail slime]], has medical properties and is used in [[cosmetics]].\n\nPerhaps the best known edible land snail species in the [[Western world]] is the [[Helix pomatia]], commonly known as [[Roman snail]] or [[Burgundy snail]]. This species is however not fit for profitable snail farming, and normally harvested from nature.\n\nCommercial snail farming in the Western world is typically done with either the ''[[Cornu aspersum]],'' formerly known as Helix ''aspersa'' M\u00fcller'','' or the [[Helix aspersa Maxima|Helix ''aspersa'' Maxima]]. In tropical climates snail farming is typically done with the ''[[African snail]],'' which biologically does not fall in the family of [[Helicidae]], and the meat of which therefore may not be called escargot.\n\n== History ==\nRoasted snail shells have been found in [[archaeological]] excavations, an indication that snails have been eaten since prehistoric times.<ref>[http://watarts.uwaterloo.ca/~dlubell/Antibes.pdf Prehistoric edible land snails in the circum-Mediterranean: the archaeological evidence.], D.

Budja (ed.), ''Neolithic Studies 11. Documenta Praehistorica XXXI'': 1-24. D. Lubell.</ref>\n\n''Lumaca romana'', (translation: Roman snail), was an ancient method of snail farming or heliciculture in the region about [[Tarquinia]]. This snail farming method was described by [[:la:Quintus Fulvius Lippinus|Fulvius Lippinus]] (49 BC) and mentioned by [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] in ''De Re rustica'' III, 12.<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Varro/de_Re_Rustica/3*.html#12 De Re Rustica III, 12]</ref> The snails were fattened for human consumption using [[spelt]] and aromatic herbs. People usually raised snails in pens near the house, and these pens were called \"[[:la:Cochlea (animal)|cochlea]].\"\n\nThe Romans, in particular, are known to have considered escargot as an elite food, as noted in the writings of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]. The Romans selected the best snails for breeding. Shells of the edible land snail species ''[[Otala lactea]]'' have been recovered in [[archaeological]] excavations of [[Volubilis]] in present-day [[Morocco]].<ref>C. Michael Hogan, ''Volubilis'', The Megalithic Portal, ed. Andy Burnham (2007) [http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=14906]</ref>\n\n[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] described the snail garden of [[Fulvius Hirpinus]] 2,000 years ago as having separate sections for different species of snails. [[Hirpinus]] allegedly fed his snails on meal and wine.\n\n\"Wall fish\" were also often eaten in Britain, but were never as popular as on the continent. There, people often ate snails during [[Lent]], and in a few places, they consumed large quantities of snails at Mardi Gras or Carnival, as a foretaste of Lent.\n\nAccording to some sources, the French exported [[Helix aspersa|brown garden snails]] to California in the 1850s, raising them as the delicacy [[escargot]]. Other sources claim that Italian immigrants were the first to bring the snail to the United States.\n\n== Economic impact ==\nU.S. imports of snails were worth more than $4.5 million in 1995 and came from 24 countries. This includes preserved or prepared snails and snails that are live, fresh, chilled, or frozen. Major exporters to the U.S. are [[France]], [[Indonesia]], [[Greece]] and [[China]]. The U.S. exported live, fresh, chilled, or frozen snails worth $55,000 to 13 countries; most were shipped to [[Japan]], the [[Netherlands]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. Individual statistics are not available for U.S. exports of prepared or processed snails from the U.S. [[Department of Commerce]].\n\n== Edible land snail species ==\n[[File:Snails-Italy.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Three different species of snails for sale in a market in [[Turin]], [[Italy]]]]\nEdible land snails range in size from about one millimeter long to the giant African snails, which occasionally grow up to {{convert|312|mm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} in length. \"Escargot\" most commonly refers to either ''[[Cornu aspersum]]'' or to ''[[Helix pomatia]]'', although other varieties of snails are eaten. ''[[Achatina fulica]]'', a giant African snail, is sliced and [[Canning|canned]] and passed off on some consumers as escargot. Terms such as \"garden snail\" or \"common brown garden snail\" are rather meaningless since they refer to so many types of snails, but they sometimes mean ''H. aspersa''.\n* ''[[Cornu aspersum]]'' is also known as the French \"petit gris,\" \"small grey snail,\" the \"escargot chagrine,\" or \"la zigrinata.\" The shell of a mature adult has four to five whorls and measures 30 to 45&nbsp;mm across. It is native to the shores of the Mediterranean and up the coast of Spain and France. It is found on many British Isles, where the Romans introduced it in the 1st century AD (Some references say it dates to the Early Bronze Age.) In the early 19th century the French brought it into California, where it has become a serious pest. These snails are now common throughout the U.S. It was introduced into several Eastern and Gulf states even before 1850 and, later introduced into other countries such as Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, Mexico, and Argentina. ''C. aspersum'' has a life span of 2 to 5 years. This species is more adaptable to different climates and conditions than many snails, and is found in woods, fields, sand dunes, and gardens. This adaptability not only increases ''C. aspersum's'' range, but it also makes farming ''C. aspersum'' easier and less risky.\n* ''[[Helix pomatia]]'' measures about 45&nbsp;mm across the shell. It also is called the \"Roman snail,\" \"apple snail,\" \"lunar,\" \"la vignaiola,\" the German \"Weinbergschnecke,\" the French \"escargot de Bourgogne\" or \"Burgundy snail,\" or \"gros blanc.\" Native over a large part of Europe, it lives in wooded mountains and valleys up to {{convert|2,000|m|ft|abbr=off}} altitude and in vineyards and gardens. The Romans may have introduced it into Britain. Immigrants introduced it into the U.S. in Michigan and Wisconsin. Many prefer ''H. pomatia'' to ''H. aspersa'' for its flavor and its larger size, as the \"escargot par excellence.\"\n* ''[[Otala lactea]]'' is sometimes called the \"vineyard snail,\" \"milk snail,\" or \"Spanish snail.\" The shell is white with reddish brown spiral bands and measures about 26 to 35&nbsp;mm in diameter.\n* ''[[Iberus alonensis]]'', the Spanish \"vaqueta\" or \"serrana,\" measures about 30&nbsp;mm across the shell.\n[[File:Cepaea nemoralis pair banded shells.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''[[Cepaea nemoralis]]'']]\n* ''[[Cepaea nemoralis]]'', the \"grove snail,\" or the Spanish \"vaqueta,\" measures about 25&nbsp;mm across the shell. It inhabits Central Europe and was introduced into, and is now naturalized in many U.S. states, from Massachusetts to California, and from Tennessee to Canada. Its habitat ranges widely from woods to dunes. It mainly eats dead plant material, but it likes nettles and buttercups and will eat dead worms and dead snails.\n* ''[[Cepaea hortensis]]'', the \"white-lipped snail,\" measures about 20&nbsp;mm across the shell which often has distinct dark stripes. It is native to central and northern Europe. This species was introduced into Maine, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire in colonial times, but it never became established in these states. Its habitat varies but ''C. hortensis'' is found in colder and wetter places than ''C. nemoralis''. Their smaller size and some people's opinion that they do not taste as good make ''C. hortensis'' and ''C. nemoralis'' less popular than the larger European land snails.\n* ''[[Otala punctata]]'', called \"vaqueta\" in some parts of Spain, measures about 35&nbsp;mm across the shell.\n* ''[[Eobania vermiculata]]'', the \"vinyala,\" \"mongeta,\" or \"xona,\" measures about 25&nbsp;mm. It is found in Mediterranean countries and was introduced into Louisiana and Texas.\n* ''[[Helix lucorum]]'', sometimes called \"escargo turc,\" measures about 45&nbsp;mm across the shell. It is found in central Italy and from Yugoslavia through the Crimea to Turkey and around the Black Sea.\n* ''[[Helix adanensis]]'' comes from around Turkey.\n* ''[[Helix aperta]]'' measures about 25&nbsp;mm. Its meat is highly prized. It is native to France, Italy, and other Mediterranean countries and has become established in California and Louisiana. Sometimes known as the \"burrowing snail,\" it is found above ground only during rainy weather. In hot, dry weather, it burrows three to six inches into the ground and becomes dormant until rain soften the soil.\n* ''[[Theba pisana]]'', also called the \"banded snail\"or the \"cargol avellanenc,\" measures about 20&nbsp;mm and lives on dry, exposed sites, usually near the sea. Native to Sicily, it has been spread to several European countries, including England. This snail is a serious garden pest and is the \"white snail\" that California once eradicated by using flamethrowers to burn off whole areas. In large numbers, up to 3,000 snails per tree, it can ravage a garden in 24 hours and a citrus or other crop in a couple of nights.\n* ''[[Sphincterochila candidissima]]'' or ''[[Leucochroa candidisima]]'', the \"cargol mongeta,\" or \"cargol jueu\" measures about 20&nbsp;mm.\n[[File:Achatina fulica Thailand.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''[[Achatina fulica]]'']]\n* ''[[Achatina fulica]]'' and other ''Achatina'' species, giant African snails. They can grow up to 326&nbsp;mm (1&nbsp;ft \u00be in) in length. Their native range is south of the Sahara in East Africa. This snail was purposely introduced into India in 1847. There was an unsuccessful attempt to establish it in Japan in 1925. It has been purposely and accidentally transported to other Pacific locations and was inadvertently released in California after World War II, in Hawaii, and later in North Miami Florida in the 1970s. In many places, it is a serious agricultural pest that causes considerable crop damage. Also, due to its large size, its slime and fecal material create a nuisance as does the odor that occurs when something like poison bait causes large numbers to die. The U.S. has made considerable effort to eradicate ''Achatina''. The [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) has banned the importation and possession of live Giant African snails.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2014/08/29/illegal-giant-snails-threatening-america/|title=Illegal giant snails threatening America|date=2014-08-29|work=New York Post|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en-US}}</ref> However, they are still sought after as pets due to the vibrant \"tiger stripes\" on their shells.\n\n== Biology ==\n\n=== Mating and egg laying ===\n\n==== General ====\nSnails are [[hermaphrodite]]s. Although they have both male and female [[reproductive organ]]s, they must mate with another snail of the same species before they lay eggs. Some snails may act as males one season and as females the next. Other snails play both roles at once and [[fertilize]] each other simultaneously. When the snail is large enough and mature enough, which may take several years, mating occurs in the late spring or early summer after several hours of [[courtship]]. Sometimes there is a second mating in summer. (In tropical climates, mating may occur several times a year. In some climates, snails mate around October and may mate a second time 2 weeks later.) After mating, the snail can store sperm received for up to a year, but it usually lays eggs within a few weeks. Snails are sometimes uninterested in mating with another snail of the same species that originated from a considerable distance away. For example, a ''H. aspersa'' from southern France may reject a ''H. aspersa'' from northern France.\n\n==== Helix ''pomatia''====\nSnails need soil at least 2&nbsp;inches deep in which to lay their eggs. For ''H. pomatia'', the soil should be at least 3&nbsp;inches deep to keep out pests such as [[ants]], [[earwig]]s, [[millipede]]s, etc. Dry soil is not suitable for the preparation of a nest, nor is soil that is too heavy. In clay soil that becomes hard, reproduction rates may decrease because the snails are unable to bury their eggs and the hatchlings have difficulty emerging from the nest. Hatchability of eggs depends on soil temperature, soil humidity, soil composition, etc. Soil consisting of 20% to 40% organic material is good. The soil should be kept at {{convert|41|to|50|F|C}}, and is best around {{convert|70|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}. Soil moisture should be maintained at 80%. One researcher removes eggs immediately after they are deposited, counts them, then keeps them on moist cotton until the eggs hatch and the young start to eat. Snails lose substantial weight by laying eggs. Some do not recover. About one-third of the snails will die after the breeding season.\n\n''H. pomatia'' eggs measure about 3&nbsp;mm in diameter and have a [[calcareous]] shell and a high [[yolk]] content. ''H. pomatia'' lays the eggs in July or August, 2 to 8 weeks after mating, in holes dug out in the ground. (Data varies widely on how long after mating snails lay eggs.) The snail puts its head into the hole or may crawl in until only the top of the shell is visible; then it deposits eggs from the genital opening just behind the head. It takes the snail 1 to 2 days to lay 30 to 50 eggs. Occasionally, the snail will lay about a dozen more a few weeks later. The snail covers the hole with a mixture of the slime it excretes and dirt. This slime, which the snail excretes to help it crawl and to help preserve the moisture in its soft body, is [[glycoprotein]] similar to eggwhite.\n\nFully developed baby ''H. pomatia'' snails hatch about 3 to 4 weeks after the eggs are laid, depending on temperature and humidity. Birds, insects, mice, toads and other predators take a heavy toll on the young snails. The snails eat and grow until the weather turns cold. They then dig a deep hole, sometimes as deep as {{convert|1|ft|cm|adj=on}}, and seal themselves inside their shell and hibernate for the winter. This is a response to both decreasing temperature and shorter hours of daylight. When the ground warms up in spring, the snail emerges and goes on a binge of replacing lost moisture and eating.\n\n==== Helix ''aspersa''====\n''H. aspersa'' eggs are white, spherical, about {{cvt|3|mm|in|frac=8}} in diameter and are laid 5 days to 3 weeks after mating. (Data varies widely due to differences in climate and regional variations in the snails' habitats.) ''H. aspersa'' lays an average of 85 eggs in a nest that is {{convert|1|to|1+1/2|in|cm}} deep. Data varies from 30 to over 120 eggs, but high figures may be from when more than one snail lays eggs in the same nest.\n\nIn warm, damp climates, ''H. aspersa'' may lay eggs as often as five times from February through October, depending on the weather and region. Mating and egg-laying begin when there are at least 10 hours of daylight and continue until days begin to get shorter. In the United States, longer hours of sunlight that occur when temperatures are still too cold will affect this schedule, but increasing hours of daylight still stimulate egg laying. If warm enough, the eggs hatch in about 2 weeks, or in 4 weeks if cooler. It takes the baby snails several more days to break out of the sealed nest and climb to the surface. In a climate similar to southern California's, ''H. aspersa'' matures in about 2 years. In central Italy, ''H. aspersa'' hatches and emerges from the soil almost exclusively in the autumn. If well fed and not overcrowded, those snails that hatch at the start of the season will reach adult size and form a lip at the edge of their shell by the following June. If the environment is manipulated to get more early [[hatchlings]], the size and number of snails that mature the following year will increase. In South Africa, some ''H. aspersa'' mature in 10 months, and under ideal conditions in a laboratory, some have matured in 6 to 8 months. Most of ''H. aspersa's'' reproductive activity takes place in the second year of its life.\n\n====Achatina ''fulica''====\nBy contrast, one giant African snail, ''Achatina fulica'', lays 100 to 400 [[elliptical]] eggs that each measure about 5&nbsp;mm long. Each snail may lay several batches of eggs each year, usually in the wet season. They may lay eggs in holes in the ground like ''H. pomatia'', or lay eggs on the surface of a rocky soil, in organic matter, or at the base of plants. In 10 to 30 days, the eggs hatch releasing snails about 4&nbsp;mm long. These snails grow up to 10&nbsp;mm per month. After 6 months, the Achatina fulica is about 35&nbsp;mm long and may already be sexually mature. [[Sexual maturity]] takes 6 to 16 months, depending on weather and the availability of [[calcium]]. This snail lives 5 or 6 years, sometimes as many as 9 years.\n\n=== Growth ===\nWithin the same snail population and under the same conditions, some snails will grow faster than others. Some will take twice as long to mature. This may help the species survive bad weather, etc., in the wild. However, a snail farmer should obviously select and keep the largest and fastest maturing snails for breeding stock and sell the smaller snails. By selecting only the largest, the average size of the snail may increase significantly in only a couple of generations. Most of the differences in growth are probably due to environmental factors including stocking density. However, to whatever extent these differences are genetic, farmers generally breed large, fast-growing snails instead of small, slower-growing ones.\n\nSeveral factors can greatly influence the growth of snails including: population density, stress (snails are sensitive to noise, light, vibration, unsanitary conditions, irregular feedings, being touched, etc.), feed, temperature and moisture, and the breeding technology used.\n\n''H. aspersa'' requires at least 3% to 4% calcium in the soil (or another source of calcium) for good growth. Most snails need more calcium in the soil than ''H. aspersa''. Low calcium intake will slow the growth rate and cause the shell to be thinner. Calcium may be set out in a feeding dish or trough so the snails can eat it at will. Food is only one calcium source. Snails may eat paint or attack walls of buildings seeking calcium, and they also will eat dirt.\n\nA newborn's shell size depends on the egg size since the shell develops from the egg's surface membrane. As the snail grows, the shell is added onto in increments. Eventually the shell will develop a flare or reinforcing lip at its opening. This shows that the snail is now mature; there will be no further shell growth. Growth is measured by shell size, since a snail's body weight varies and fluctuates, even in 100% humidity. The growth rate varies considerably between individuals in each population group. Adult size, which is related to the growth rate, also varies, thus the fastest growers are usually the largest snails. Eggs from larger, healthier snails also tend to grow faster and thus larger.\n\nDryness inhibits growth and even stops activity. When it becomes too hot and dry in summer, the snail becomes inactive, seals its shell and [[estivation|estivates]] (becomes dormant) until cooler, moister weather returns. Some snails estivate in groups on tree trunks, posts, or walls. They seal themselves to the surface, thus sealing up the shell opening.\n\nPeak snail activity (including feeding and thus growth) occurs a few hours after sunset, when the temperature is lower and the water content (in the form of [[dew]]) is higher. During daytime snails usually seek shelter.\n\n<br />\n\n== Values of the snail ==\n\n=== Nutritional value ===\nThe nutrient composition of raw snails (per 100&nbsp;grams of edible portion), according to information from the nutrient databank of France,{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} is:\n\n*[[Food energy|Energy]]: 80.5 [[calorie|kcal]] (337 [[kilojoule|kJ]])\n*[[Water]]: 79 g\n*[[Protein]]: 16 g\n* Available [[carbohydrates]]: 2 g\n*[[Fiber]]: 0 g\n*[[Fat]]: 1 g\n*[[Magnesium]]: 250&nbsp;mg\n*[[Calcium]]: 170&nbsp;mg\n*[[Iron]]: 3.5&nbsp;mg\n*[[Vitamin C]]: 0&nbsp;mg\n\n=== Biochemical content ===\n\n== Farming snails ==\nSuccessful snail culture requires the correct equipment and supplies, including: [[snail pens]] or enclosures; devices for measuring humidity ([[hygrometer]]), temperature ([[thermometer]]), soil moisture ([[soil moisture sensor]]), and light (in foot candles); a weight scale and an instrument to measure snail size; a kit for testing soil contents; and a magnifying glass to see the eggs. Equipment to control the climate ([[temperature]] and [[humidity]]), to regulate water (e.g., a sprinkler system to keep the snails moist and a drainage system), to provide light and shade, and to kill or keep out pests and predators may also be needed. Some horticultural systems such as artificial lighting systems and water sprinklers may be adapted for snail culture. Better results are obtained if snails of the same kind and generation are used. Some recommend putting the hatchlings in another pen.\n\nFour systems of snail farms can be distinguished:\n* Outdoor pens.\n* In buildings with a controlled climate.\n* In closed systems such as plastic tunnel houses or \"[[greenhouse]]s.\"\n* In addition, snails may breed and hatch inside in a controlled environment and then (after 6 to 8 weeks) may be placed in outside pens to mature.\n\n=== Keyfactors to successful snail farming ===\n\n==== Hygiene ====\nGood hygiene can prevent the spread of disease and otherwise improve the health and growth rate of snails. Food is replaced daily in order to prevent spoilage. Earthworms added to the soil help keep the pen clean.\n\n[[Parasitism|Parasites]], [[nematode]]s, [[trematoda|trematodes]], [[fungi]], and micro[[arthropod]]s can attack snails, and such problems can spread rapidly when snail populations are dense. The bacterium ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' causes intestinal infections that can spread rapidly in a crowded snail pen.\n\nPossible predators include [[rat]]s, [[Mouse|mice]], [[Mole (animal)|moles]], [[skunk]]s, [[weasel]]s, [[bird]]s, [[frog]]s and [[toad]]s, [[lizard]]s, walking insects (e.g., some [[beetle]] and [[Cricket (insect)|cricket]] varieties), some types of [[Fly|flies]], [[centipede]]s, and even certain carnivorous snail species, such as ''[[Strangesta capillacea]]''.\n\n==== Population density ====\nPopulation density also affects successful snail production. Pens should contain no more than six to eight fair-sized snails per square foot, or about four large ''H. pomatias''; or figure one kilogram per square meter (about .2 pounds of snail per square foot), which automatically compensates for the size of the snails. To encourage breeding, best results will occur with not more than eight snails per square meter (0.8 per square foot). Some sources say that, for ''H. pomatia'' to breed, 2 to 4 snails per square meter (0.2 to 0.4 per square foot) is the maximum.\n\nSnails tend not to breed when packed too densely or when the [[wikt:slime|slime]] in the pen accumulates too much. The slime apparently works like a [[pheromone]] and suppresses reproduction. On the other hand, snails in groups of about 100 seem to breed better than when only a few snails are confined together. Perhaps they have more potential mates from which to choose. Snails in a densely populated area grow more slowly even when food is abundant, and they also have a higher mortality rate. These snails then become smaller adults who lay fewer clutches of eggs, have fewer eggs per clutch, and the eggs have a lower hatch rate. Smaller adult snails sell for less. [[Dwarfing]] is quite common in snail farming and is attributable mainly to rearing conditions rather than [[heredity]] factors. Crowding snails is false economy. A recommended rate for ''H. aspersa'' is not more than one-third pound per square foot (3.6&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) of soil surface for snails that weigh more than 1&nbsp;gram and not more than 0.2 pound per square foot (2.2&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) for snails that weigh less. (One ounce is about 28&nbsp;grams.)\n\n==== Feeding ====\nFeeding season is April through October, (or may vary with the local climate), with a \"rest period\" during the summer. Do not place food in one small clump so that there is not enough room for all the snails to get to it. Snails eat solid food by [[rasping]] it away with their [[radula]]. Feeding activity depends on the weather, and snails may not necessarily feed every day. Evening irrigation in dry weather may encourage feeding since the moisture makes it easier for the snails to move about.\n\nPut the breeding snails in the breeding pens in April or early May. Feed until mid June when mating begins and the snails stop feeding. Snails resume eating after they lay eggs. Once snails have laid their eggs, the adult snails can be removed. This leaves more food and less crowding for the hatchlings.\n\nSnails of the same species collected from different regions may have different food preferences. Some foods that snails eat are: [[Alyssum]], fruit and leaves of [[apple]], [[apricot]], [[artichoke]] (a favorite), [[Aster (genus)|aster]], [[barley]], [[beans]], [[bindweed]], [[California boxwood]], almost any [[cabbage]] variety, [[camomile]], [[carnation]], [[carrot]], [[cauliflower]], [[celeriac]] (root celery), [[celery]], ripe [[cherries]], [[chive]], citrus, [[clover]], [[cucumber]]s (a favorite snail food), [[dandelion]], [[Elderberry|elder]], [[henbane]], [[hibiscus]], [[hollyhock]], [[kale]], larkspur ([[Consolida]] or [[Delphinium]] genera), [[leek]], lettuce (liked, and makes good snails), [[lily]], [[magnolia]], [[mountain ash]], [[mulberry]], [[chrysanthemum]], [[Tropaeolum|nasturtium]], [[Urtica|nettle]], [[nightshade]] berries, [[oats]], [[onion]] greens, [[pansy]], [[parsley]], [[peach]], ripe [[pear]]s, [[pea]]s, [[petunia]], [[phlox]], [[plum]], [[potato]]es (raw or cooked), [[pumpkin]]s, [[radish]], [[rapeseed|rape]], [[rose]], [[sorrel]], [[spinach]], [[sweet pea]], [[thistle]], [[tomato]]es (well liked), [[turnip]], [[wheat]], [[yarrow]], [[zinnia]]. They will eat sweet [[lupin]]es, but will reject bitter [[lupin]]es and other plants with high [[quinolizidine]] [[alkaloid]]s. Snails also avoid plants that produce other defensive chemicals, defensive stem hairs, etc.\n\nSnails usually prefer juicy leaves and vegetables over dry ones. If snails are fed vegetable trimmings, damaged fruit, and cooked potatoes, uneaten food must be promptly removed as it will quickly spoil. Bran may be supplied that is wet or sprinkled dry over leafy vegetables. The diet may consist of 20% [[wheat bran]] while 80% is fruit and vegetable material. Some growers use [[oats]], [[corn meal]], [[soybean meal]], or [[chicken]] mash. Laying mash provides calcium, as does crushed [[oyster]] shells. Snails also may eat materials such as cardboard (but do not purposely feed it to them); they can eat through shipping cartons and escape. Snails may sometimes eat, within a 24-hour period, food equal to 10%, and occasionally as much as 20%, of their [[body weight]]. Active snails deprived of food will lose more than one-third of their weight before they starve to death\u2014a process that takes 8 to 12 weeks. Estivating snails can survive much longer.\n\nSupply calcium at least once a week if it is not available in the soil. It should not contain harmful salts or be so alkaline as to burn the snails. Mix calcium with wet bran or mashed potatoes and serve on a pan; this will keep any leftover food from rotting on the ground.\n\nSome researchers use chicken mash for feed. A plastic pipe can be cut in half lengthwise to make two troughs which can be used as feeders for mash. Mix laying mash (used for egg-producing hens) into the feed to provide calcium for the snails' shells. Commercial chicken feeding mash is around 16% to 17% protein, from fish meal and meat meal, making it good for growing snails. Supplying mash to hatchlings might reduce cannibalism. Two feeds that snails like and that promote good growth are: (A) broiler finisher mash consisting of 7% broiler concentrate, 58% corn, 16% soya, 18% sorghum, 7% limestone flour (40% Ca); and (B) chicken feed (pellets) for layers consisting of 5% layer concentrate, 10%, corn, 15% soya, 20% sorghum, 44% barley, 6% limestone flour (40% Ca).\n\nPellets are fine for larger snails, but mash is better for younger ones. Pellets should be partially crushed if fed to young snails. Snails do not grow well if rabbit pellets are their primary diet. Snails show a distinct preference for moist feed. Easy access to enough water must be ensured if snails are fed dry mash.\n\nBe sure to frequently clean the feed and water dishes. The amount of feed a snail eats depends very much on air humidity and on the availability of drinking water. Clean drinking water can be served in a shallow container to reduce the risk of the snail drowning. Some types of chicken waterers may be suitable. Other factors (e.g., temperature, light intensity, food preferences versus food supplied, etc.) also affect feeding. A compromise, until the optimum feed is found, is to feed half green vegetable material and half chicken feed/grain/animal protein.\n\nYoung ''H. aspersa'' readily eats [[milk powder]]. Its rapid rate of assimilation promotes rapid growth.\n\n==== Climate ====\nA mild climate {{convert|15|-|25|C|F}} with high humidity (75% to 95%) is best for snail farming, though most varieties can stand a wider range of temperatures. The optimal temperature is {{convert|21|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} for many varieties. When the temperature falls below {{convert|7|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, snails hibernate. Under {{convert|12|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} the snails are inactive, and under {{convert|10|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, all growth stops. When the temperature rises much above {{convert|27|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} or conditions become too dry, snails estivate. Wind is bad for snails because it speeds up moisture loss, and snails must retain moisture.\n\nSnails thrive in damp but not waterlogged environments and thus a well-draining soil is required. Research indicates that water content around 80% of the carrying capacity of the soil and air [[humidity]] over 80% (during darkness) are the most favorable conditions. Many farmers use [[Aerosol spray|mist-producing devices]] to maintain proper moisture in the air and/or soil.<ref>http://publications.cta.int/publications/publication/1497/</ref> Also, if the system contains alive vegetation, the leaves are to be periodically wet.\n\n====[[Soil]]====\nSnails dig in soil and ingest it. Good soil favors snail growth and provides some of their nutrition. Lack of access to good soil may cause fragile shells even when the snails have well-balanced feed; the snails growth may lag far behind the growth of other snails on good soil. Snails will often eat feed, then go eat dirt. Sometimes, they will eat only one or the other.\n\nA well-functional soil would have the following characteristics:\n* Containing neither a lot of [[sand]] nor too much [[clay]], as snails strive to dig into hard clay and sand dries out easily.\n* 20\u201340% organic matter content. Organic matter enhances [[cation exchange capacity]] of calcium and [[magnesium]] which in turn stimulates growth.\n* [[pH]] around 7.\n* Adequate [[calcium]], the primary constituent of shells (up to 98%). A common way to introduce calcium is to add ground [[limestone]] at a suggested concentration of {{convert|0.5|kg/m2|lb/sqft}}. Calcium may also be set out in a feeding dish or trough so the snails can eat it at will. More advanced techniques involve the addition of [[polyacrylamide]] with the following concentration: 12.5&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> of a 160&nbsp;g M.A./one preparation in 250 cc of water per kilogram of dry soil. Such stabilization treatment helps the soil structure resist washing and allows regular cleaning without destroying the crumb structure of the soil that is beneficial for egg laying.\n\nSoil care: A farmer must find a way to prevent the soil from becoming fouled with mucus and droppings and also tackle undesirable [[Soil chemistry|chemical changes]] that may occur in time.\n\nSoil mix suggestions:\n* [[peat]], clay, [[compost]] and [[calcium carbonate|CaCO<sub>3</sub>]]\n* [[Leaf mold]] (at pH 7)\n\n=== Pens and enclosures ===\n\nThe U.S. [[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service]] ([[APHIS]]) Standards for [[Snail-Rearing Facilities]] were revised March 2001 and are available on the APHIS website.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/ppq/permits/plantpest/rearing.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2020-01-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060415075557/http://www.aphis.usda.gov/ppq/permits/plantpest/rearing.pdf |archive-date=2006-04-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nEnclosures for snails are usually long and thin instead of square. This allows the workers to walk around (without harming the snails) and reach into the whole pen. The enclosure may be a trough with sides made of [[wood]], [[Concrete masonry unit|block]], [[fiber cement sheets]], or [[galvanized]] [[sheet steel]]. Cover it with [[Sieve|screen]] or [[netting]]. The covering confines the snails and keeps out birds and other predators. Fences or walls are usually {{convert|2|ft|cm|sigfig=1}} high plus at least {{convert|5|in|cm}} into the ground. Fencing made of galvanized metal or hard-plastic sheets helps keep out some predators. A cover will protect against heavy rain. Shade (which may be a fine mesh screen) on warm winter days helps keep the snails dormant. 5&nbsp;mm mesh or finer is used for pen screens or fences. Pens containing baby snails need a finer mesh.\n\nSnails need hiding places, especially during the warm daytime. Plastic soil drainage pipes from the local [[garden center]] can be split in two lengthwise, and stacked one layer one way and the next layer at a right angle, providing shelter and also increasing by 50% the number of snails that can live in the pen.\n\nA sprinkler system ensures moisture when needed and can be turned on at sunset rather than earlier in the day, when the moisture may drive snails out into hot sunshine. Temperature and humidity can be monitored using a thermometer and a hygrometer.\n\nThe bottom of the enclosure, if it is not the ground or trays of dirt, needs be a surface more solid than screening. A snail placed in a wire-mesh-bottom pen will keep crawling, trying to get off the wires and onto solid, more comfortable ground.\n\nIn order to prevent escapes, in an open pen, the top of the fences curve inward in a half circle; this works to confine the vineyard snail. However, ''H. aspersa'' can escape from such an open pen, and an electric fence may be needed to contain them. [The [[electric fence]] top has two or more thin wires that are 2 to 4&nbsp;mm apart. Each wire carries the opposite charge of the wire next to it. A battery or transformer is used to supply 4 to 12 [[volt]]s to the wire. A snail will get a mild shock and retract when it crawls over a wire and touches a second wire.]\n\nAnother technique to confine snails is to bend the fence top inward into a sharp \"V\" shape with about a 20-degree angle. The snail's shell will hit the bent-back part of the screen before the snail can reach up and start crawling on it. This blocks the snail, and the angled screen automatically compensates for the size of the snail.\n\nAnother alternative, suitable for solid wall enclosures, is to attach to the wall a horizontal piece of screen that projects inward several inches over the enclosure. The screen is made with material such as nylon monofilament that is moderately stiff and springy yet easily flexible. On the inside edge of the screen, the cross fibers are removed, producing a fringe several inches wide. When a snail crawls on the underside of the screen and moves out onto the fringe, his weight pulls several individual fibers down. One by one, another fiber gets away from the snail and springs back up out of reach. Eventually the snail is dangling by a thread. The snail then falls, because the surface area is not big enough to crawl on.\n\nBecause snails usually will not cross a [[copper]] band, another solution is to top the fence with a copper band at least {{convert|3|in|cm|round=5}} wide. The band can be bent so that part of it faces inward and is parallel to the pen floor. The band must not be placed very close to the ground, because rain may wash soil against the copper and leave a residue that may enable the snail to cross it. The bottom of the fence must be buried deep enough into the ground so that the snails cannot dig under it.\n\nAn alternate method is to make a square pen with a {{convert|10|ft|m|adj=on}}-square garden in it. Plant about six crops, e.g., [[Urtica|nettles]] and [[artichoke]]s, inside the pen. The snails will choose what they want to eat. If it has not rained, turn sprinklers on for about 15 minutes at dusk, unless the snails are dormant. A disadvantage to this method is that, if the snails are not mature at the end of the year, it is difficult to replant fresh plant crops in the pens.\n\nPlastic tunnels make cheap, easy snail enclosures, but it is difficult to regulate heat and humidity. The tunnel will be {{convert|10|to|20|F-change|C-change|0}} warmer than the outside, and snails become dormant when the temperature climbs above {{convert|80|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}.\n\nWhen snails are raised indoors under controlled conditions, reproduction varies according to the geographic origin of the [[breeding stock]]. For example, one researcher found that ''H. aspersa'' snails from [[Brittany]] seem to do better indoors than snails from another region. To breed snails indoors, the temperature needs to be kept at {{convert|70|F|C}} and the relative humidity at 80% to 90%; some sources say 95%. Another source recommends 75% humidity by day and 95% at night. The [[Center for Heliciculture]] once recommended 65\u201375% humidity during the day and 85\u201395% at night at {{convert|68|F|C}}. In any event, avoid humidity higher than 95% (some say 90%) for any length of time. Excessive humidity can kill snails. Optimum temperature and relative humidity depend on several things, including the snail variety and even where breeding stock was gathered. For ''H. aspersa'', the optimum temperature for hatching eggs seems to be {{convert|68|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} at 100% relative humidity. The second best temperature/humidity combination depends on where the snails came from and results can drop drastically to 0% hatching at {{convert|17|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} and 100% humidity. The soil must not be kept wet when the humidity is maintained at 100%, as the eggs will absorb water, swell up, and burst.\n\n[[Fluorescent lamp]]s can be used to give artificial daylight. Different snails respond to day length in different ways. The ratio of light to darkness influences activity, feeding, and mating and egg-laying. Eighteen or more hours of light apparently stimulate ''H. aspersa'' growth, while less than 12 hours inhibit it. Some snail species may associates the long hours of light with the start of summer\u2014the peak growing season. Eighteen hours of daylight also appear optimal for breeding (mating and egg laying), but snails will breed in darkness.\n\nSnails can be bred in boxes or cages stacked several units high. An automatic sprinkler system can be used to provide moisture. Breeding cages need a feed trough and a water trough. Plastic trays a couple of inches deep are adequate; deeper water troughs increase the chance of snails drowning in them. Trays can be set on a bed of small gravel. Small plastic pots, e.g., flower pots about {{convert|3|in|cm}} deep, can be filled with sterilized dirt (or a loamy pH neutral soil) and set in the gravel to give the snails a place to lay their eggs. After the snails lay eggs each pot is replaced. (Set one pot inside another so that one can be easily lifted without shifting the gravel.)\n\nWhen the snails have laid their eggs, the pots are put in a nursery where the eggs will hatch. The young snails are kept in the nursery for about 6 weeks, and then moved to a separate pen, as young snails do best if kept with other snails of similar size. Eight hours of daylight is optimal for young snails.\n\nBaby snails are fed on tender [[lettuce]] leaves ([[Boston lettuce|Boston]] type, but [[head lettuce|head]] type is probably also good.)\n\nSome who raise ''H. aspersa'' separate the five stages: reproduction, hatching, young, fattening, and final fattening.\n\nIn a typical example, the [[Reproduction|breeding]] box has [[concrete]] sides, soil with [[earthworm]]s (to cleanse the soil) on the bottom, vegetation, curved tiles to provide shelter, feeders, and a chicken waterer. [[Mosquito]] netting or screening covers the top. These breeding boxes may be outside, or better results may be obtained when the boxes are inside a greenhouse\u2014as long as the greenhouse does not get too hot or too dry. One researcher reported that in outdoor boxes, each breeder snail had about seven young. In greenhouses, each breeder snail had about 9 to 12 young. The researcher felt that under better weather conditions than those he had that year, each adult breeder snail would have produced 15 young snails.\n\n[[Fattening pens]] can be outside or in a greenhouse. High summer temperatures and insufficient moisture cause dwarfing and malformations of some snails. This is more a problem inside greenhouses if the sun overheats the building. A sprinkler system (e.g., a [[horticultural]] system or common lawn sprinklers) can supply moisture. Make sure excess water can drain.\n\nFattening pens may contain {{convert|2|by|3|ft|m|adj=on}} pieces (or other convenient size) of heavy plastic sheets, hung from boards resting on a rack that lets the tips of the plastic sheets just touch the ground. The plastic sheets are about {{convert|4|in|cm}} apart. The sheets give the snails a resting and hiding place. Feeders may be located on the rack that supports the plastic sheets.\n\nA layer of coarse sand and [[topsoil]] with earthworms is placed on the fattening pen's bottom. The worms help clean up the snail droppings.\n\nSnails that hatched the previous summer can be put in a chilled room for hibernation over winter. About 1 April, (adjusted for local climate), they are moved to the final fattening pen. IN cases where there are several fattening pens, the smaller snails are placed in one, medium in another, large in another. One-third of a pound of ''H. aspersa'' snails require one square foot of pen. Snails lose weight when they estivate in summer, therefore some growers do not stock pens by weight but by count. For ''H. aspersa'', 10 to 12 snails per square foot is the maximum.\n\n=== The phases in snail farming ===\n\n==== Breeding ====\n\n==== Hatchery and nursery ====\nCannibalism by hatchlings\n\nThe first snails to hatch eat the shells of their eggs. This gives them calcium needed for their shells. They may then begin eating unhatched eggs. If the snail eggs are kept at the optimum temperature, {{convert|68|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} (for some varieties), and if none of the eggs lose moisture, most eggs will hatch within 1 to 3 days of each other. [[Cannibalism]] also will be low. If hatching extends over a longer period, cannibalism may increase. Some eggs eaten are eggs that were not fertile or did not develop properly, but sometimes, properly developing embryos might be eaten. A high density of \"clutches\" of egg masses increases the rate of cannibalism, as other nearby egg masses are more likely to be found and eaten. Snail egg has 12 to 20 times the protein of lettuce. The protein helps the baby snails start developing quickly and be healthier. Snail egg is an excellent starter food for newly hatched snails, but they tend to only eat eggs of their own species.\n\n==== Fattening/growing ====\n\n==== Harvest and purging ====\n{{Main|Escargot}}\nSnails are mature when a lip forms at the opening of their shell. Before they mature, their shells are more easily broken, making them undesirable. For ''H. aspersa'', commercial weight is 8&nbsp;grams or larger. \n\nSnail eggs are also harvested and processed to produce [[snail caviar]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://mg.co.za/article/2007-12-15-snail-caviar-the-new-gourmet-frontier |title=Snail caviar!

Introduced slug and snail varieties tend to be worse pests than native species, probably due in part to the lack of natural controls. Snail pests attack crops ranging from leafy vegetables to fruits that grow near the ground, such as strawberries and tomatoes, to citrus fruits high up on trees.\n\nThe [[Federal Plant Pest Act]] defines a plant pest as \"any living stage (including active and dormant forms) of [[insect]]s, [[mite]]s, [[nematode]]s, [[slug]]s, [[snail]]s, [[protozoa]], or other [[invertebrate]] animals, [[bacteria]], [[fungi]], other [[parasite|parasitic plants]] or reproductive parts thereof; viruses; or any organisms similar to or allied with any of the foregoing; or any [[infection|infectious]] substances, which can directly or indirectly injure or cause disease or damage in or to any plants or parts thereof, or any processed, manufactured, or other products of plants...\" The [[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service]] (APHIS) categorizes giant African snails as a \"quarantine significant plant pest.\" The United States does not allow live giant African snails into the country under any circumstances. It is illegal to own or to possess them. APHIS vigorously enforces this regulation and destroys or returns these snails to their country of origin.\n\nSince large infestations of snails can do devastating damage, many states have quarantines against nursery products, and other products, from infested states. Further, it is illegal to import snails (or slugs) into the U.S. without permission from the [[Plant Protection and Quarantine Division]] (PPQ), [[Animal Plant Health and Inspection Service]], U.S. Department of Agriculture. APHIS also oversees interstate transportation of snails. Anyone who plans to \"import, release, or make interstate shipments of\" snails, must complete APHIS's PPQ Form 526, Application and Permit to Move Live Plant Pests and Noxious Weeds. This form should be submitted to the State regulatory official. The state will process the request and make a recommendation to APHIS who will then make a decision.\n\nInformation on Plant Pest Permits is available at APHIS's website [https://web.archive.org/web/20040608020604/http://shellsclub.by.ru/files/review_hel.htm].\n\nThe [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) regulates the canning of low-[[acid]] foods such as snails. According to FDA, \"establishments engaged in the manufacture of Low-acid or Acidified Canned Foods (LACF) offered for interstate commerce in the United States are required...to register their facility...and file scheduled processes for their products with\" the FDA. This does not refer to fresh products. For appropriate forms, contact: LACF Registration Coordinator, HFS-618, Food and Drug Administration, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, 200 C Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20204. Telephone: (202) 205-5282. FAX: (202) 205-4758 or (202) 205-4128.\n\nImproper canning of low-acid meats, e.g., snails, involves a risk of [[botulism]]. When canning snails for home consumption, carefully follow canning instructions for low-acid meats to prevent food poisoning.\n\nState laws also may apply to imports into certain states and to raising snails in a given state. Some states may want to inspect and approve facilities. Thus anyone who plans to raise snails also should check with their State's Agriculture Department.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{More footnotes|date=April 2009}}\n* Rebecca Thompson and Sheldon Cheney [https://web.archive.org/web/20040608020604/http://shellsclub.by.ru/files/review_hel.htm '''Raising Snails'''] \"[[National Agricultural Library]], [[Agricultural Research Service]], [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]].\"\n* {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040608020604/http://shellsclub.by.ru/files/review_hel.htm |date=June 8, 2004 |title=Source of this article in Russian }}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060711074205/http://bursaagricola.ro/Info-CRESTEREA_MELCILOR-4-23640-1.html Source of this article in] Romanian\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080728004505/http://www.rirdc.gov.au/reports/NAP/00-188.htm Breeding and Growing Snails Commercially in Australia]\n* [http://escargot.free.fr/eng/index.html Escargot Passion]\n* [https://rirdc.infoservices.com.au/items/06-104 Free-range Snail Farming in Australia] Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation, Australian government\n* [http://www.manandmollusc.net/molluscan_food_files/molluscan_food_terrestrial.html Man and Mollusc's Data Base of Edible Molluscs]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080416174658/http://www.sdnetwork.kabissa.org/newscollection/ideanews_1.htm#GrowSnail Snail Farming in Africa]\n* [http://www.snailcream.co.uk/heliculture/ Snail Farming (Heliculture)]\n* [http://africabusinessclassroom.com/snail-farming-in-nigeria-how-to-start-make-money/  Snail Farming in Nigeria]\n\n{{Edible molluscs}}\n\n[[Category:Agriculture]]\n[[Category:Gastropods and humans]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Eyragues-l-Escargot-des-Alpilles-5738.jpg|thumb|A snail farm near [[Eyragues]], [[Provence]], [[France]]]]\n'''Heliciculture''', commonly known as '''snail farming''', is the process of raising edible [[land snail]]s, primarily for human consumption or cosmetic use. The meat and  [[Snail caviar|snail eggs]] can be consumed as [[escargot]] and as a type of caviar respectively. Mucus, commonly known as [[snail slime]], has medical properties and is used in [[cosmetics]].\n\nPerhaps the best known edible land snail species in the [[Western world]] is the [[Helix pomatia]], commonly known as [[Roman snail]] or [[Burgundy snail]]. This species is however not fit for profitable snail farming, and normally harvested from nature.\n\nCommercial snail farming in the Western world is typically done with either the ''[[Cornu aspersum]],'' formerly known as Helix ''aspersa'' M\u00fcller'','' or the [[Helix aspersa Maxima|Helix ''aspersa'' Maxima]]. In tropical climates snail farming is typically done with the ''[[African snail]],'' which biologically does not fall in the family of [[Helicidae]], and the meat of which therefore may not be called escargot.\n\n== History ==\nRoasted snail shells have been found in [[archaeological]] excavations, an indication that snails have been eaten since prehistoric times.<ref>[http://watarts.uwaterloo.ca/~dlubell/Antibes.pdf Prehistoric edible land snails in the circum-Mediterranean: the archaeological evidence.], D.

Lubell.</ref>\n\n''Lumaca romana'', (translation: Roman snail), was an ancient method of snail farming or heliciculture in the region about [[Tarquinia]]. This snail farming method was described by [[:la:Quintus Fulvius Lippinus|Fulvius Lippinus]] (49 BC) and mentioned by [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] in ''De Re rustica'' III, 12.<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Varro/de_Re_Rustica/3*.html#12 De Re Rustica III, 12]</ref> The snails were fattened for human consumption using [[spelt]] and aromatic herbs. People usually raised snails in pens near the house, and these pens were called \"[[:la:Cochlea (animal)|cochlea]].\"\n\nThe Romans, in particular, are known to have considered escargot as an elite food, as noted in the writings of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]. The Romans selected the best snails for breeding. Shells of the edible land snail species ''[[Otala lactea]]'' have been recovered in [[archaeological]] excavations of [[Volubilis]] in present-day [[Morocco]].<ref>C. Michael Hogan, ''Volubilis'', The Megalithic Portal, ed. Andy Burnham (2007) [http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=14906]</ref>\n\n[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] described the snail garden of [[Fulvius Hirpinus]] 2,000 years ago as having separate sections for different species of snails. [[Hirpinus]] allegedly fed his snails on meal and wine.\n\n\"Wall fish\" were also often eaten in Britain, but were never as popular as on the continent. There, people often ate snails during [[Lent]], and in a few places, they consumed large quantities of snails at Mardi Gras or Carnival, as a foretaste of Lent.\n\nAccording to some sources, the French exported [[Helix aspersa|brown garden snails]] to California in the 1850s, raising them as the delicacy [[escargot]]. Other sources claim that Italian immigrants were the first to bring the snail to the United States.\n\n== Economic impact ==\nU.S. imports of snails were worth more than $4.5 million in 1995 and came from 24 countries. This includes preserved or prepared snails and snails that are live, fresh, chilled, or frozen. Major exporters to the U.S. are [[France]], [[Indonesia]], [[Greece]] and [[China]]. The U.S. exported live, fresh, chilled, or frozen snails worth $55,000 to 13 countries; most were shipped to [[Japan]], the [[Netherlands]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. Individual statistics are not available for U.S. exports of prepared or processed snails from the U.S. [[Department of Commerce]].\n\n== Edible land snail species ==\n[[File:Snails-Italy.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Three different species of snails for sale in a market in [[Turin]], [[Italy]]]]\nEdible land snails range in size from about one millimeter long to the giant African snails, which occasionally grow up to {{convert|312|mm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} in length. \"Escargot\" most commonly refers to either ''[[Cornu aspersum]]'' or to ''[[Helix pomatia]]'', although other varieties of snails are eaten. ''[[Achatina fulica]]'', a giant African snail, is sliced and [[Canning|canned]] and passed off on some consumers as escargot. Terms such as \"garden snail\" or \"common brown garden snail\" are rather meaningless since they refer to so many types of snails, but they sometimes mean ''H. aspersa''.\n* ''[[Cornu aspersum]]'' is also known as the French \"petit gris,\" \"small grey snail,\" the \"escargot chagrine,\" or \"la zigrinata.\" The shell of a mature adult has four to five whorls and measures 30 to 45&nbsp;mm across. It is native to the shores of the Mediterranean and up the coast of Spain and France. It is found on many British Isles, where the Romans introduced it in the 1st century AD (Some references say it dates to the Early Bronze Age.) In the early 19th century the French brought it into California, where it has become a serious pest. These snails are now common throughout the U.S. It was introduced into several Eastern and Gulf states even before 1850 and, later introduced into other countries such as Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, Mexico, and Argentina. ''C. aspersum'' has a life span of 2 to 5 years. This species is more adaptable to different climates and conditions than many snails, and is found in woods, fields, sand dunes, and gardens. This adaptability not only increases ''C. aspersum's'' range, but it also makes farming ''C. aspersum'' easier and less risky.\n* ''[[Helix pomatia]]'' measures about 45&nbsp;mm across the shell. It also is called the \"Roman snail,\" \"apple snail,\" \"lunar,\" \"la vignaiola,\" the German \"Weinbergschnecke,\" the French \"escargot de Bourgogne\" or \"Burgundy snail,\" or \"gros blanc.\" Native over a large part of Europe, it lives in wooded mountains and valleys up to {{convert|2,000|m|ft|abbr=off}} altitude and in vineyards and gardens. The Romans may have introduced it into Britain. Immigrants introduced it into the U.S. in Michigan and Wisconsin. Many prefer ''H. pomatia'' to ''H. aspersa'' for its flavor and its larger size, as the \"escargot par excellence.\"\n* ''[[Otala lactea]]'' is sometimes called the \"vineyard snail,\" \"milk snail,\" or \"Spanish snail.\" The shell is white with reddish brown spiral bands and measures about 26 to 35&nbsp;mm in diameter.\n* ''[[Iberus alonensis]]'', the Spanish \"vaqueta\" or \"serrana,\" measures about 30&nbsp;mm across the shell.\n[[File:Cepaea nemoralis pair banded shells.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''[[Cepaea nemoralis]]'']]\n* ''[[Cepaea nemoralis]]'', the \"grove snail,\" or the Spanish \"vaqueta,\" measures about 25&nbsp;mm across the shell. It inhabits Central Europe and was introduced into, and is now naturalized in many U.S. states, from Massachusetts to California, and from Tennessee to Canada. Its habitat ranges widely from woods to dunes. It mainly eats dead plant material, but it likes nettles and buttercups and will eat dead worms and dead snails.\n* ''[[Cepaea hortensis]]'', the \"white-lipped snail,\" measures about 20&nbsp;mm across the shell which often has distinct dark stripes. It is native to central and northern Europe. This species was introduced into Maine, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire in colonial times, but it never became established in these states. Its habitat varies but ''C. hortensis'' is found in colder and wetter places than ''C. nemoralis''. Their smaller size and some people's opinion that they do not taste as good make ''C. hortensis'' and ''C. nemoralis'' less popular than the larger European land snails.\n* ''[[Otala punctata]]'', called \"vaqueta\" in some parts of Spain, measures about 35&nbsp;mm across the shell.\n* ''[[Eobania vermiculata]]'', the \"vinyala,\" \"mongeta,\" or \"xona,\" measures about 25&nbsp;mm. It is found in Mediterranean countries and was introduced into Louisiana and Texas.\n* ''[[Helix lucorum]]'', sometimes called \"escargo turc,\" measures about 45&nbsp;mm across the shell. It is found in central Italy and from Yugoslavia through the Crimea to Turkey and around the Black Sea.\n* ''[[Helix adanensis]]'' comes from around Turkey.\n* ''[[Helix aperta]]'' measures about 25&nbsp;mm. Its meat is highly prized. It is native to France, Italy, and other Mediterranean countries and has become established in California and Louisiana. Sometimes known as the \"burrowing snail,\" it is found above ground only during rainy weather. In hot, dry weather, it burrows three to six inches into the ground and becomes dormant until rain soften the soil.\n* ''[[Theba pisana]]'', also called the \"banded snail\"or the \"cargol avellanenc,\" measures about 20&nbsp;mm and lives on dry, exposed sites, usually near the sea. Native to Sicily, it has been spread to several European countries, including England. This snail is a serious garden pest and is the \"white snail\" that California once eradicated by using flamethrowers to burn off whole areas. In large numbers, up to 3,000 snails per tree, it can ravage a garden in 24 hours and a citrus or other crop in a couple of nights.\n* ''[[Sphincterochila candidissima]]'' or ''[[Leucochroa candidisima]]'', the \"cargol mongeta,\" or \"cargol jueu\" measures about 20&nbsp;mm.\n[[File:Achatina fulica Thailand.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''[[Achatina fulica]]'']]\n* ''[[Achatina fulica]]'' and other ''Achatina'' species, giant African snails. They can grow up to 326&nbsp;mm (1&nbsp;ft \u00be in) in length. Their native range is south of the Sahara in East Africa. This snail was purposely introduced into India in 1847. There was an unsuccessful attempt to establish it in Japan in 1925. It has been purposely and accidentally transported to other Pacific locations and was inadvertently released in California after World War II, in Hawaii, and later in North Miami Florida in the 1970s. In many places, it is a serious agricultural pest that causes considerable crop damage. Also, due to its large size, its slime and fecal material create a nuisance as does the odor that occurs when something like poison bait causes large numbers to die. The U.S. has made considerable effort to eradicate ''Achatina''. The [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) has banned the importation and possession of live Giant African snails.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2014/08/29/illegal-giant-snails-threatening-america/|title=Illegal giant snails threatening America|date=2014-08-29|work=New York Post|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en-US}}</ref> However, they are still sought after as pets due to the vibrant \"tiger stripes\" on their shells.\n\n== Biology ==\n\n=== Mating and egg laying ===\n\n==== General ====\nSnails are [[hermaphrodite]]s. Although they have both male and female [[reproductive organ]]s, they must mate with another snail of the same species before they lay eggs. Some snails may act as males one season and as females the next. Other snails play both roles at once and [[fertilize]] each other simultaneously. When the snail is large enough and mature enough, which may take several years, mating occurs in the late spring or early summer after several hours of [[courtship]]. Sometimes there is a second mating in summer. (In tropical climates, mating may occur several times a year. In some climates, snails mate around October and may mate a second time 2 weeks later.) After mating, the snail can store sperm received for up to a year, but it usually lays eggs within a few weeks. Snails are sometimes uninterested in mating with another snail of the same species that originated from a considerable distance away. For example, a ''H. aspersa'' from southern France may reject a ''H. aspersa'' from northern France.\n\n==== Helix ''pomatia''====\nSnails need soil at least 2&nbsp;inches deep in which to lay their eggs. For ''H. pomatia'', the soil should be at least 3&nbsp;inches deep to keep out pests such as [[ants]], [[earwig]]s, [[millipede]]s, etc. Dry soil is not suitable for the preparation of a nest, nor is soil that is too heavy. In clay soil that becomes hard, reproduction rates may decrease because the snails are unable to bury their eggs and the hatchlings have difficulty emerging from the nest. Hatchability of eggs depends on soil temperature, soil humidity, soil composition, etc. Soil consisting of 20% to 40% organic material is good. The soil should be kept at {{convert|41|to|50|F|C}}, and is best around {{convert|70|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}. Soil moisture should be maintained at 80%. One researcher removes eggs immediately after they are deposited, counts them, then keeps them on moist cotton until the eggs hatch and the young start to eat. Snails lose substantial weight by laying eggs. Some do not recover. About one-third of the snails will die after the breeding season.\n\n''H. pomatia'' eggs measure about 3&nbsp;mm in diameter and have a [[calcareous]] shell and a high [[yolk]] content. ''H. pomatia'' lays the eggs in July or August, 2 to 8 weeks after mating, in holes dug out in the ground. (Data varies widely on how long after mating snails lay eggs.) The snail puts its head into the hole or may crawl in until only the top of the shell is visible; then it deposits eggs from the genital opening just behind the head. It takes the snail 1 to 2 days to lay 30 to 50 eggs. Occasionally, the snail will lay about a dozen more a few weeks later. The snail covers the hole with a mixture of the slime it excretes and dirt. This slime, which the snail excretes to help it crawl and to help preserve the moisture in its soft body, is [[glycoprotein]] similar to eggwhite.\n\nFully developed baby ''H. pomatia'' snails hatch about 3 to 4 weeks after the eggs are laid, depending on temperature and humidity. Birds, insects, mice, toads and other predators take a heavy toll on the young snails. The snails eat and grow until the weather turns cold. They then dig a deep hole, sometimes as deep as {{convert|1|ft|cm|adj=on}}, and seal themselves inside their shell and hibernate for the winter. This is a response to both decreasing temperature and shorter hours of daylight. When the ground warms up in spring, the snail emerges and goes on a binge of replacing lost moisture and eating.\n\n==== Helix ''aspersa''====\n''H. aspersa'' eggs are white, spherical, about {{cvt|3|mm|in|frac=8}} in diameter and are laid 5 days to 3 weeks after mating. (Data varies widely due to differences in climate and regional variations in the snails' habitats.) ''H. aspersa'' lays an average of 85 eggs in a nest that is {{convert|1|to|1+1/2|in|cm}} deep. Data varies from 30 to over 120 eggs, but high figures may be from when more than one snail lays eggs in the same nest.\n\nIn warm, damp climates, ''H. aspersa'' may lay eggs as often as five times from February through October, depending on the weather and region. Mating and egg-laying begin when there are at least 10 hours of daylight and continue until days begin to get shorter. In the United States, longer hours of sunlight that occur when temperatures are still too cold will affect this schedule, but increasing hours of daylight still stimulate egg laying. If warm enough, the eggs hatch in about 2 weeks, or in 4 weeks if cooler. It takes the baby snails several more days to break out of the sealed nest and climb to the surface. In a climate similar to southern California's, ''H. aspersa'' matures in about 2 years. In central Italy, ''H. aspersa'' hatches and emerges from the soil almost exclusively in the autumn. If well fed and not overcrowded, those snails that hatch at the start of the season will reach adult size and form a lip at the edge of their shell by the following June. If the environment is manipulated to get more early [[hatchlings]], the size and number of snails that mature the following year will increase. In South Africa, some ''H. aspersa'' mature in 10 months, and under ideal conditions in a laboratory, some have matured in 6 to 8 months. Most of ''H. aspersa's'' reproductive activity takes place in the second year of its life.\n\n====Achatina ''fulica''====\nBy contrast, one giant African snail, ''Achatina fulica'', lays 100 to 400 [[elliptical]] eggs that each measure about 5&nbsp;mm long. Each snail may lay several batches of eggs each year, usually in the wet season. They may lay eggs in holes in the ground like ''H. pomatia'', or lay eggs on the surface of a rocky soil, in organic matter, or at the base of plants. In 10 to 30 days, the eggs hatch releasing snails about 4&nbsp;mm long. These snails grow up to 10&nbsp;mm per month. After 6 months, the Achatina fulica is about 35&nbsp;mm long and may already be sexually mature. [[Sexual maturity]] takes 6 to 16 months, depending on weather and the availability of [[calcium]]. This snail lives 5 or 6 years, sometimes as many as 9 years.\n\n=== Growth ===\nWithin the same snail population and under the same conditions, some snails will grow faster than others. Some will take twice as long to mature. This may help the species survive bad weather, etc., in the wild. However, a snail farmer should obviously select and keep the largest and fastest maturing snails for breeding stock and sell the smaller snails. By selecting only the largest, the average size of the snail may increase significantly in only a couple of generations. Most of the differences in growth are probably due to environmental factors including stocking density. However, to whatever extent these differences are genetic, farmers generally breed large, fast-growing snails instead of small, slower-growing ones.\n\nSeveral factors can greatly influence the growth of snails including: population density, stress (snails are sensitive to noise, light, vibration, unsanitary conditions, irregular feedings, being touched, etc.), feed, temperature and moisture, and the breeding technology used.\n\n''H. aspersa'' requires at least 3% to 4% calcium in the soil (or another source of calcium) for good growth. Most snails need more calcium in the soil than ''H. aspersa''. Low calcium intake will slow the growth rate and cause the shell to be thinner. Calcium may be set out in a feeding dish or trough so the snails can eat it at will. Food is only one calcium source. Snails may eat paint or attack walls of buildings seeking calcium, and they also will eat dirt.\n\nA newborn's shell size depends on the egg size since the shell develops from the egg's surface membrane. As the snail grows, the shell is added onto in increments. Eventually the shell will develop a flare or reinforcing lip at its opening. This shows that the snail is now mature; there will be no further shell growth. Growth is measured by shell size, since a snail's body weight varies and fluctuates, even in 100% humidity. The growth rate varies considerably between individuals in each population group. Adult size, which is related to the growth rate, also varies, thus the fastest growers are usually the largest snails. Eggs from larger, healthier snails also tend to grow faster and thus larger.\n\nDryness inhibits growth and even stops activity. When it becomes too hot and dry in summer, the snail becomes inactive, seals its shell and [[estivation|estivates]] (becomes dormant) until cooler, moister weather returns. Some snails estivate in groups on tree trunks, posts, or walls. They seal themselves to the surface, thus sealing up the shell opening.\n\nPeak snail activity (including feeding and thus growth) occurs a few hours after sunset, when the temperature is lower and the water content (in the form of [[dew]]) is higher. During daytime snails usually seek shelter.\n\n<br />\n\n== Values of the snail ==\n\n=== Nutritional value ===\nThe nutrient composition of raw snails (per 100&nbsp;grams of edible portion), according to information from the nutrient databank of France,{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} is:\n\n*[[Food energy|Energy]]: 80.5 [[calorie|kcal]] (337 [[kilojoule|kJ]])\n*[[Water]]: 79 g\n*[[Protein]]: 16 g\n* Available [[carbohydrates]]: 2 g\n*[[Fiber]]: 0 g\n*[[Fat]]: 1 g\n*[[Magnesium]]: 250&nbsp;mg\n*[[Calcium]]: 170&nbsp;mg\n*[[Iron]]: 3.5&nbsp;mg\n*[[Vitamin C]]: 0&nbsp;mg\n\n=== Biochemical content ===\n\n== Farming snails ==\nSuccessful snail culture requires the correct equipment and supplies, including: [[snail pens]] or enclosures; devices for measuring humidity ([[hygrometer]]), temperature ([[thermometer]]), soil moisture ([[soil moisture sensor]]), and light (in foot candles); a weight scale and an instrument to measure snail size; a kit for testing soil contents; and a magnifying glass to see the eggs. Equipment to control the climate ([[temperature]] and [[humidity]]), to regulate water (e.g., a sprinkler system to keep the snails moist and a drainage system), to provide light and shade, and to kill or keep out pests and predators may also be needed. Some horticultural systems such as artificial lighting systems and water sprinklers may be adapted for snail culture. Better results are obtained if snails of the same kind and generation are used. Some recommend putting the hatchlings in another pen.\n\nFour systems of snail farms can be distinguished:\n* Outdoor pens.\n* In buildings with a controlled climate.\n* In closed systems such as plastic tunnel houses or \"[[greenhouse]]s.\"\n* In addition, snails may breed and hatch inside in a controlled environment and then (after 6 to 8 weeks) may be placed in outside pens to mature.\n\n=== Keyfactors to successful snail farming ===\n\n==== Hygiene ====\nGood hygiene can prevent the spread of disease and otherwise improve the health and growth rate of snails. Food is replaced daily in order to prevent spoilage. Earthworms added to the soil help keep the pen clean.\n\n[[Parasitism|Parasites]], [[nematode]]s, [[trematoda|trematodes]], [[fungi]], and micro[[arthropod]]s can attack snails, and such problems can spread rapidly when snail populations are dense. The bacterium ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' causes intestinal infections that can spread rapidly in a crowded snail pen.\n\nPossible predators include [[rat]]s, [[Mouse|mice]], [[Mole (animal)|moles]], [[skunk]]s, [[weasel]]s, [[bird]]s, [[frog]]s and [[toad]]s, [[lizard]]s, walking insects (e.g., some [[beetle]] and [[Cricket (insect)|cricket]] varieties), some types of [[Fly|flies]], [[centipede]]s, and even certain carnivorous snail species, such as ''[[Strangesta capillacea]]''.\n\n==== Population density ====\nPopulation density also affects successful snail production. Pens should contain no more than six to eight fair-sized snails per square foot, or about four large ''H. pomatias''; or figure one kilogram per square meter (about .2 pounds of snail per square foot), which automatically compensates for the size of the snails. To encourage breeding, best results will occur with not more than eight snails per square meter (0.8 per square foot). Some sources say that, for ''H. pomatia'' to breed, 2 to 4 snails per square meter (0.2 to 0.4 per square foot) is the maximum.\n\nSnails tend not to breed when packed too densely or when the [[wikt:slime|slime]] in the pen accumulates too much. The slime apparently works like a [[pheromone]] and suppresses reproduction. On the other hand, snails in groups of about 100 seem to breed better than when only a few snails are confined together. Perhaps they have more potential mates from which to choose. Snails in a densely populated area grow more slowly even when food is abundant, and they also have a higher mortality rate. These snails then become smaller adults who lay fewer clutches of eggs, have fewer eggs per clutch, and the eggs have a lower hatch rate. Smaller adult snails sell for less. [[Dwarfing]] is quite common in snail farming and is attributable mainly to rearing conditions rather than [[heredity]] factors. Crowding snails is false economy. A recommended rate for ''H. aspersa'' is not more than one-third pound per square foot (3.6&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) of soil surface for snails that weigh more than 1&nbsp;gram and not more than 0.2 pound per square foot (2.2&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) for snails that weigh less. (One ounce is about 28&nbsp;grams.)\n\n==== Feeding ====\nFeeding season is April through October, (or may vary with the local climate), with a \"rest period\" during the summer. Do not place food in one small clump so that there is not enough room for all the snails to get to it. Snails eat solid food by [[rasping]] it away with their [[radula]]. Feeding activity depends on the weather, and snails may not necessarily feed every day. Evening irrigation in dry weather may encourage feeding since the moisture makes it easier for the snails to move about.\n\nPut the breeding snails in the breeding pens in April or early May. Feed until mid June when mating begins and the snails stop feeding. Snails resume eating after they lay eggs. Once snails have laid their eggs, the adult snails can be removed. This leaves more food and less crowding for the hatchlings.\n\nSnails of the same species collected from different regions may have different food preferences. Some foods that snails eat are: [[Alyssum]], fruit and leaves of [[apple]], [[apricot]], [[artichoke]] (a favorite), [[Aster (genus)|aster]], [[barley]], [[beans]], [[bindweed]], [[California boxwood]], almost any [[cabbage]] variety, [[camomile]], [[carnation]], [[carrot]], [[cauliflower]], [[celeriac]] (root celery), [[celery]], ripe [[cherries]], [[chive]], citrus, [[clover]], [[cucumber]]s (a favorite snail food), [[dandelion]], [[Elderberry|elder]], [[henbane]], [[hibiscus]], [[hollyhock]], [[kale]], larkspur ([[Consolida]] or [[Delphinium]] genera), [[leek]], lettuce (liked, and makes good snails), [[lily]], [[magnolia]], [[mountain ash]], [[mulberry]], [[chrysanthemum]], [[Tropaeolum|nasturtium]], [[Urtica|nettle]], [[nightshade]] berries, [[oats]], [[onion]] greens, [[pansy]], [[parsley]], [[peach]], ripe [[pear]]s, [[pea]]s, [[petunia]], [[phlox]], [[plum]], [[potato]]es (raw or cooked), [[pumpkin]]s, [[radish]], [[rapeseed|rape]], [[rose]], [[sorrel]], [[spinach]], [[sweet pea]], [[thistle]], [[tomato]]es (well liked), [[turnip]], [[wheat]], [[yarrow]], [[zinnia]]. They will eat sweet [[lupin]]es, but will reject bitter [[lupin]]es and other plants with high [[quinolizidine]] [[alkaloid]]s. Snails also avoid plants that produce other defensive chemicals, defensive stem hairs, etc.\n\nSnails usually prefer juicy leaves and vegetables over dry ones. If snails are fed vegetable trimmings, damaged fruit, and cooked potatoes, uneaten food must be promptly removed as it will quickly spoil. Bran may be supplied that is wet or sprinkled dry over leafy vegetables. The diet may consist of 20% [[wheat bran]] while 80% is fruit and vegetable material. Some growers use [[oats]], [[corn meal]], [[soybean meal]], or [[chicken]] mash. Laying mash provides calcium, as does crushed [[oyster]] shells. Snails also may eat materials such as cardboard (but do not purposely feed it to them); they can eat through shipping cartons and escape. Snails may sometimes eat, within a 24-hour period, food equal to 10%, and occasionally as much as 20%, of their [[body weight]]. Active snails deprived of food will lose more than one-third of their weight before they starve to death\u2014a process that takes 8 to 12 weeks. Estivating snails can survive much longer.\n\nSupply calcium at least once a week if it is not available in the soil. It should not contain harmful salts or be so alkaline as to burn the snails. Mix calcium with wet bran or mashed potatoes and serve on a pan; this will keep any leftover food from rotting on the ground.\n\nSome researchers use chicken mash for feed. A plastic pipe can be cut in half lengthwise to make two troughs which can be used as feeders for mash. Mix laying mash (used for egg-producing hens) into the feed to provide calcium for the snails' shells. Commercial chicken feeding mash is around 16% to 17% protein, from fish meal and meat meal, making it good for growing snails. Supplying mash to hatchlings might reduce cannibalism. Two feeds that snails like and that promote good growth are: (A) broiler finisher mash consisting of 7% broiler concentrate, 58% corn, 16% soya, 18% sorghum, 7% limestone flour (40% Ca); and (B) chicken feed (pellets) for layers consisting of 5% layer concentrate, 10%, corn, 15% soya, 20% sorghum, 44% barley, 6% limestone flour (40% Ca).\n\nPellets are fine for larger snails, but mash is better for younger ones. Pellets should be partially crushed if fed to young snails. Snails do not grow well if rabbit pellets are their primary diet. Snails show a distinct preference for moist feed. Easy access to enough water must be ensured if snails are fed dry mash.\n\nBe sure to frequently clean the feed and water dishes. The amount of feed a snail eats depends very much on air humidity and on the availability of drinking water. Clean drinking water can be served in a shallow container to reduce the risk of the snail drowning. Some types of chicken waterers may be suitable. Other factors (e.g., temperature, light intensity, food preferences versus food supplied, etc.) also affect feeding. A compromise, until the optimum feed is found, is to feed half green vegetable material and half chicken feed/grain/animal protein.\n\nYoung ''H. aspersa'' readily eats [[milk powder]]. Its rapid rate of assimilation promotes rapid growth.\n\n==== '''Climate''' ====\nA mild climate {{convert|15|-|25|C|F}} with high humidity (75% to 95%) is best for snail farming, though most varieties can stand a wider range of temperatures. The optimal temperature is {{convert|21|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} for many varieties. When the temperature falls below {{convert|7|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, snails hibernate. Under {{convert|12|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} the snails are inactive, and under {{convert|10|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, all growth stops. When the temperature rises much above {{convert|27|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} or conditions become too dry, snails estivate. Wind is bad for snails because it speeds up moisture loss, and snails must retain moisture.\n\nSnails thrive in damp but not waterlogged environments and thus a well-draining soil is required. Research indicates that water content around 80% of the carrying capacity of the soil and air [[humidity]] over 80% (during darkness) are the most favorable conditions. Many farmers use [[Aerosol spray|mist-producing devices]] to maintain proper moisture in the air and/or soil.<ref>http://publications.cta.int/publications/publication/1497/</ref> Also, if the system contains alive vegetation, the leaves are to be periodically wet.\n\n==== '''[[Soil]]''' ====\nSnails dig in soil and ingest it. Good soil favors snail growth and provides some of their nutrition. Lack of access to good soil may cause fragile shells even when the snails have well-balanced feed; the snails growth may lag far behind the growth of other snails on good soil. Snails will often eat feed, then go eat dirt. Sometimes, they will eat only one or the other.\n\nA well-functional soil would have the following characteristics:\n* Containing neither a lot of [[sand]] nor too much [[clay]], as snails strive to dig into hard clay and sand dries out easily.\n* 20\u201340% organic matter content. Organic matter enhances [[cation exchange capacity]] of calcium and [[magnesium]] which in turn stimulates growth.\n* [[pH]] around 7.\n* Adequate [[calcium]], the primary constituent of shells (up to 98%). A common way to introduce calcium is to add ground [[limestone]] at a suggested concentration of {{convert|0.5|kg/m2|lb/sqft}}. Calcium may also be set out in a feeding dish or trough so the snails can eat it at will. More advanced techniques involve the addition of [[polyacrylamide]] with the following concentration: 12.5&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> of a 160&nbsp;g M.A./one preparation in 250 cc of water per kilogram of dry soil. Such stabilization treatment helps the soil structure resist washing and allows regular cleaning without destroying the crumb structure of the soil that is beneficial for egg laying.\n\nSoil care: A farmer must find a way to prevent the soil from becoming fouled with mucus and droppings and also tackle undesirable [[Soil chemistry|chemical changes]] that may occur in time.\n\nSoil mix suggestions:\n* [[peat]], clay, [[compost]] and [[calcium carbonate|CaCO<sub>3</sub>]]\n* [[Leaf mold]] (at pH 7)\n\n=== Pens and enclosures ===\n\nThe U.S. [[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service]] ([[APHIS]]) Standards for [[Snail-Rearing Facilities]] were revised March 2001 and are available on the APHIS website.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/ppq/permits/plantpest/rearing.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2020-01-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060415075557/http://www.aphis.usda.gov/ppq/permits/plantpest/rearing.pdf |archive-date=2006-04-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nEnclosures for snails are usually long and thin instead of square. This allows the workers to walk around (without harming the snails) and reach into the whole pen. The enclosure may be a trough with sides made of [[wood]], [[Concrete masonry unit|block]], [[fiber cement sheets]], or [[galvanized]] [[sheet steel]]. Cover it with [[Sieve|screen]] or [[netting]]. The covering confines the snails and keeps out birds and other predators. Fences or walls are usually {{convert|2|ft|cm|sigfig=1}} high plus at least {{convert|5|in|cm}} into the ground. Fencing made of galvanized metal or hard-plastic sheets helps keep out some predators. A cover will protect against heavy rain. Shade (which may be a fine mesh screen) on warm winter days helps keep the snails dormant. 5&nbsp;mm mesh or finer is used for pen screens or fences. Pens containing baby snails need a finer mesh.\n\nSnails need hiding places, especially during the warm daytime. Plastic soil drainage pipes from the local [[garden center]] can be split in two lengthwise, and stacked one layer one way and the next layer at a right angle, providing shelter and also increasing by 50% the number of snails that can live in the pen.\n\nA sprinkler system ensures moisture when needed and can be turned on at sunset rather than earlier in the day, when the moisture may drive snails out into hot sunshine. Temperature and humidity can be monitored using a thermometer and a hygrometer.\n\nThe bottom of the enclosure, if it is not the ground or trays of dirt, needs be a surface more solid than screening. A snail placed in a wire-mesh-bottom pen will keep crawling, trying to get off the wires and onto solid, more comfortable ground.\n\nIn order to prevent escapes, in an open pen, the top of the fences curve inward in a half circle; this works to confine the vineyard snail. However, ''H. aspersa'' can escape from such an open pen, and an electric fence may be needed to contain them. [The [[electric fence]] top has two or more thin wires that are 2 to 4&nbsp;mm apart. Each wire carries the opposite charge of the wire next to it. A battery or transformer is used to supply 4 to 12 [[volt]]s to the wire. A snail will get a mild shock and retract when it crawls over a wire and touches a second wire.]\n\nAnother technique to confine snails is to bend the fence top inward into a sharp \"V\" shape with about a 20-degree angle. The snail's shell will hit the bent-back part of the screen before the snail can reach up and start crawling on it. This blocks the snail, and the angled screen automatically compensates for the size of the snail.\n\nAnother alternative, suitable for solid wall enclosures, is to attach to the wall a horizontal piece of screen that projects inward several inches over the enclosure. The screen is made with material such as nylon monofilament that is moderately stiff and springy yet easily flexible. On the inside edge of the screen, the cross fibers are removed, producing a fringe several inches wide. When a snail crawls on the underside of the screen and moves out onto the fringe, his weight pulls several individual fibers down. One by one, another fiber gets away from the snail and springs back up out of reach. Eventually the snail is dangling by a thread. The snail then falls, because the surface area is not big enough to crawl on.\n\nBecause snails usually will not cross a [[copper]] band, another solution is to top the fence with a copper band at least {{convert|3|in|cm|round=5}} wide. The band can be bent so that part of it faces inward and is parallel to the pen floor. The band must not be placed very close to the ground, because rain may wash soil against the copper and leave a residue that may enable the snail to cross it. The bottom of the fence must be buried deep enough into the ground so that the snails cannot dig under it.\n\nAn alternate method is to make a square pen with a {{convert|10|ft|m|adj=on}}-square garden in it. Plant about six crops, e.g., [[Urtica|nettles]] and [[artichoke]]s, inside the pen. The snails will choose what they want to eat. If it has not rained, turn sprinklers on for about 15 minutes at dusk, unless the snails are dormant. A disadvantage to this method is that, if the snails are not mature at the end of the year, it is difficult to replant fresh plant crops in the pens.\n\nPlastic tunnels make cheap, easy snail enclosures, but it is difficult to regulate heat and humidity. The tunnel will be {{convert|10|to|20|F-change|C-change|0}} warmer than the outside, and snails become dormant when the temperature climbs above {{convert|80|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}.\n\nWhen snails are raised indoors under controlled conditions, reproduction varies according to the geographic origin of the [[breeding stock]]. For example, one researcher found that ''H. aspersa'' snails from [[Brittany]] seem to do better indoors than snails from another region. To breed snails indoors, the temperature needs to be kept at {{convert|70|F|C}} and the relative humidity at 80% to 90%; some sources say 95%. Another source recommends 75% humidity by day and 95% at night. The [[Center for Heliciculture]] once recommended 65\u201375% humidity during the day and 85\u201395% at night at {{convert|68|F|C}}. In any event, avoid humidity higher than 95% (some say 90%) for any length of time. Excessive humidity can kill snails. Optimum temperature and relative humidity depend on several things, including the snail variety and even where breeding stock was gathered. For ''H. aspersa'', the optimum temperature for hatching eggs seems to be {{convert|68|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} at 100% relative humidity. The second best temperature/humidity combination depends on where the snails came from and results can drop drastically to 0% hatching at {{convert|17|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} and 100% humidity. The soil must not be kept wet when the humidity is maintained at 100%, as the eggs will absorb water, swell up, and burst.\n\n[[Fluorescent lamp]]s can be used to give artificial daylight. Different snails respond to day length in different ways. The ratio of light to darkness influences activity, feeding, and mating and egg-laying. Eighteen or more hours of light apparently stimulate ''H. aspersa'' growth, while less than 12 hours inhibit it. Some snail species may associates the long hours of light with the start of summer\u2014the peak growing season. Eighteen hours of daylight also appear optimal for breeding (mating and egg laying), but snails will breed in darkness.\n\nSnails can be bred in boxes or cages stacked several units high. An automatic sprinkler system can be used to provide moisture. Breeding cages need a feed trough and a water trough. Plastic trays a couple of inches deep are adequate; deeper water troughs increase the chance of snails drowning in them. Trays can be set on a bed of small gravel. Small plastic pots, e.g., flower pots about {{convert|3|in|cm}} deep, can be filled with sterilized dirt (or a loamy pH neutral soil) and set in the gravel to give the snails a place to lay their eggs. After the snails lay eggs each pot is replaced. (Set one pot inside another so that one can be easily lifted without shifting the gravel.)\n\nWhen the snails have laid their eggs, the pots are put in a nursery where the eggs will hatch. The young snails are kept in the nursery for about 6 weeks, and then moved to a separate pen, as young snails do best if kept with other snails of similar size. Eight hours of daylight is optimal for young snails.\n\nBaby snails are fed on tender [[lettuce]] leaves ([[Boston lettuce|Boston]] type, but [[head lettuce|head]] type is probably also good.)\n\nSome who raise ''H. aspersa'' separate the five stages: reproduction, hatching, young, fattening, and final fattening.\n\nIn a typical example, the [[Reproduction|breeding]] box has [[concrete]] sides, soil with [[earthworm]]s (to cleanse the soil) on the bottom, vegetation, curved tiles to provide shelter, feeders, and a chicken waterer. [[Mosquito]] netting or screening covers the top. These breeding boxes may be outside, or better results may be obtained when the boxes are inside a greenhouse\u2014as long as the greenhouse does not get too hot or too dry. One researcher reported that in outdoor boxes, each breeder snail had about seven young. In greenhouses, each breeder snail had about 9 to 12 young. The researcher felt that under better weather conditions than those he had that year, each adult breeder snail would have produced 15 young snails.\n\n[[Fattening pens]] can be outside or in a greenhouse. High summer temperatures and insufficient moisture cause dwarfing and malformations of some snails. This is more a problem inside greenhouses if the sun overheats the building. A sprinkler system (e.g., a [[horticultural]] system or common lawn sprinklers) can supply moisture. Make sure excess water can drain.\n\nFattening pens may contain {{convert|2|by|3|ft|m|adj=on}} pieces (or other convenient size) of heavy plastic sheets, hung from boards resting on a rack that lets the tips of the plastic sheets just touch the ground. The plastic sheets are about {{convert|4|in|cm}} apart. The sheets give the snails a resting and hiding place. Feeders may be located on the rack that supports the plastic sheets.\n\nA layer of coarse sand and [[topsoil]] with earthworms is placed on the fattening pen's bottom. The worms help clean up the snail droppings.\n\nSnails that hatched the previous summer can be put in a chilled room for hibernation over winter. About 1 April, (adjusted for local climate), they are moved to the final fattening pen. IN cases where there are several fattening pens, the smaller snails are placed in one, medium in another, large in another. One-third of a pound of ''H. aspersa'' snails require one square foot of pen. Snails lose weight when they estivate in summer, therefore some growers do not stock pens by weight but by count. For ''H. aspersa'', 10 to 12 snails per square foot is the maximum.\n\n=== The phases in snail farming ===\n\n==== Breeding ====\n\n==== Hatchery and nursery ====\nCannibalism by hatchlings\n\nThe first snails to hatch eat the shells of their eggs. This gives them calcium needed for their shells. They may then begin eating unhatched eggs. If the snail eggs are kept at the optimum temperature, {{convert|68|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} (for some varieties), and if none of the eggs lose moisture, most eggs will hatch within 1 to 3 days of each other. [[Cannibalism]] also will be low. If hatching extends over a longer period, cannibalism may increase. Some eggs eaten are eggs that were not fertile or did not develop properly, but sometimes, properly developing embryos might be eaten. A high density of \"clutches\" of egg masses increases the rate of cannibalism, as other nearby egg masses are more likely to be found and eaten. Snail egg has 12 to 20 times the protein of lettuce. The protein helps the baby snails start developing quickly and be healthier. Snail egg is an excellent starter food for newly hatched snails, but they tend to only eat eggs of their own species.\n\n==== Fattening/growing ====\n\n==== Harvest and purging ====\n{{Main|Escargot}}\nSnails are mature when a lip forms at the opening of their shell. Before they mature, their shells are more easily broken, making them undesirable. For ''H. aspersa'', commercial weight is 8&nbsp;grams or larger. \n\nSnail eggs are also harvested and processed to produce [[snail caviar]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://mg.co.za/article/2007-12-15-snail-caviar-the-new-gourmet-frontier |title=Snail caviar!

Introduced slug and snail varieties tend to be worse pests than native species, probably due in part to the lack of natural controls. Snail pests attack crops ranging from leafy vegetables to fruits that grow near the ground, such as strawberries and tomatoes, to citrus fruits high up on trees.\n\nThe [[Federal Plant Pest Act]] defines a plant pest as \"any living stage (including active and dormant forms) of [[insect]]s, [[mite]]s, [[nematode]]s, [[slug]]s, [[snail]]s, [[protozoa]], or other [[invertebrate]] animals, [[bacteria]], [[fungi]], other [[parasite|parasitic plants]] or reproductive parts thereof; viruses; or any organisms similar to or allied with any of the foregoing; or any [[infection|infectious]] substances, which can directly or indirectly injure or cause disease or damage in or to any plants or parts thereof, or any processed, manufactured, or other products of plants...\" The [[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service]] (APHIS) categorizes giant African snails as a \"quarantine significant plant pest.\" The United States does not allow live giant African snails into the country under any circumstances. It is illegal to own or to possess them. APHIS vigorously enforces this regulation and destroys or returns these snails to their country of origin.\n\nSince large infestations of snails can do devastating damage, many states have quarantines against nursery products, and other products, from infested states. Further, it is illegal to import snails (or slugs) into the U.S. without permission from the [[Plant Protection and Quarantine Division]] (PPQ), [[Animal Plant Health and Inspection Service]], U.S. Department of Agriculture. APHIS also oversees interstate transportation of snails. Anyone who plans to \"import, release, or make interstate shipments of\" snails, must complete APHIS's PPQ Form 526, Application and Permit to Move Live Plant Pests and Noxious Weeds. This form should be submitted to the State regulatory official. The state will process the request and make a recommendation to APHIS who will then make a decision.\n\nInformation on Plant Pest Permits is available at APHIS's website [https://web.archive.org/web/20040608020604/http://shellsclub.by.ru/files/review_hel.htm].\n\nThe [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) regulates the canning of low-[[acid]] foods such as snails. According to FDA, \"establishments engaged in the manufacture of Low-acid or Acidified Canned Foods (LACF) offered for interstate commerce in the United States are required...to register their facility...and file scheduled processes for their products with\" the FDA. This does not refer to fresh products.

When canning snails for home consumption, carefully follow canning instructions for low-acid meats to prevent food poisoning.\n\nState laws also may apply to imports into certain states and to raising snails in a given state. Some states may want to inspect and approve facilities. Thus anyone who plans to raise snails also should check with their State's Agriculture Department.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{More footnotes|date=April 2009}}\n* Rebecca Thompson and Sheldon Cheney [https://web.archive.org/web/20040608020604/http://shellsclub.by.ru/files/review_hel.htm '''Raising Snails'''] \"[[National Agricultural Library]], [[Agricultural Research Service]], [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]].\"\n* {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040608020604/http://shellsclub.by.ru/files/review_hel.htm |date=June 8, 2004 |title=Source of this article in Russian }}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060711074205/http://bursaagricola.ro/Info-CRESTEREA_MELCILOR-4-23640-1.html Source of this article in] Romanian\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080728004505/http://www.rirdc.gov.au/reports/NAP/00-188.htm Breeding and Growing Snails Commercially in Australia]\n* [http://escargot.free.fr/eng/index.html Escargot Passion]\n* [https://rirdc.infoservices.com.au/items/06-104 Free-range Snail Farming in Australia] Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation, Australian government\n* [http://www.manandmollusc.net/molluscan_food_files/molluscan_food_terrestrial.html Man and Mollusc's Data Base of Edible Molluscs]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080416174658/http://www.sdnetwork.kabissa.org/newscollection/ideanews_1.htm#GrowSnail Snail Farming in Africa]\n* [http://www.snailcream.co.uk/heliculture/ Snail Farming (Heliculture)]\n* [http://africabusinessclassroom.com/snail-farming-in-nigeria-how-to-start-make-money/  Snail Farming in Nigeria]\n\n{{Edible molluscs}}\n\n[[Category:Agriculture]]\n[[Category:Gastropods and humans]]\n", "name_user": "Chescargot", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliciculture"}
