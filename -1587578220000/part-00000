It is a member of the class of [[prostaglandin receptors]] which bind with and respond to various [[prostaglandin]]s. DP<sub>2</sub> along with [[Prostaglandin DP1 receptor]] are receptors for [[prostaglandin D2]] (PGD2). Activation of DP<sub>2</sub> by PGD2 or other cognate [[receptor ligand]]s has been associated with certain physiological and pathological responses, particularly those associated with allergy and inflammation, in animal models and certain human diseases.\n\n==Gene==\nThe PTGDR2 gene is located on human chromosome 11 at position q12.2 (i.e. 11q12.2). It consists of two [[intron]]s and three [[exon]]s and codes for a [[G protein coupled receptor]] (GPCR) composed of 472 amino acids. DP<sub>2</sub>, is related to members of the [[chemotactic factor]] class of GPCRs, sharing an amino acid sequence identity of 29% with the [[C5a receptor]], [[Formyl peptide receptor 1]], and [[Formyl peptide receptor 2]] receptors. DP<sub>2</sub> has little or no such amino acid sequence relationship to the eight other [[Prostanoid receptor]]s (see [[Eicosanoid receptor#Prostenoid receptors]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?cmd=Retrieve&dopt=full_report&list_uids=11251|title= PTGDR2 prostaglandin D2 receptor 2|website = Gene Resources NCBI }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid10036181\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Marchese A, Sawzdargo M, Nguyen T, Cheng R, Heng HH, Nowak T, Im DS, Lynch KR, George SR, O'dowd BF | title = Discovery of three novel orphan G-protein-coupled receptors | journal = Genomics | volume = 56 | issue = 1 | pages = 12\u201321 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10036181 | doi = 10.1006/geno.1998.5655 | url = }}</ref>\n\n==Expression==\nDP<sub>2</sub> was found to stimulate the directed movement or [[chemotaxis]] of human T-helper type 2 cells (see [[T helper cell#Th1/Th2 Model for helper T cells]]) by binding to a receptor initially termed GPR44 and thereafter CRTH2 (for '''C'''hemoattractant '''R'''eceptor-homologous molecule expressed on '''T'''-'''H'''elper type 2 cells).

The [[cyclopentenone prostaglandins]], PGJ2, \u039412-PGJ2, and 15-d-\u039412,14-PGJ2 are spontaneously formed or protein-facilitated derivatives of PGD<sub>2</sub> that are generated in vitro as well as in vivo; these derivatives have binding affinities and activating potencies on DP<sub>2</sub> that are similar to PGD<sub>2</sub>. Studies suggest that at least some if not most or all of the cytotoxic effects of cylopenenone prostaglandin derivatives of PGD2 act independently of DP2. Certain metabolites and derivatives of PGD2 viz., 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGD2 and 15(S)-15-methyl-PGD2, are ~10-fold less active than PGD2 while the drug [[indomethacin]] is weak in activating DP<sub>2</sub>.<ref name=\"guidetopharmacology.org\"/>\n\n===Inhibiting ligands===\nThe following compounds are selective [[receptor antagonist]]s of and thereby inhibit the activation of DP<sub>2</sub>: [[fevipiprant]], [[setipiprant]], ADC-3680, AZD-1981, MK-1029, MK-7246, OC-459, OC000459, QAV-680, and TM30089. [[Ramatroban]] and vidupiprant are non-selective (i.e. known to influence other receptors) antagonists of DP<sub>2</sub>.<ref name=\"guidetopharmacology.org\"/>\n\n== Mechanisms of cell activation ==\nG protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as DP<sub>2</sub> are [[integral membrane protein]]s that, when bound by their cognate ligands (or, in some cases, even when not ligand-bound and thereby acting continuously in a constitutive manner {see [[Receptor (biochemistry)#Constitutive activity]]}), mobilize one or more types of [[Heterotrimeric G protein]]s. DP<sub>2</sub> is classified as a \"contractile\" prostanoid receptor in that it can cause the contraction of smooth muscle. As evidenced by its initial discovery as a receptor for PGD<sub>2</sub> in T-helper type 2 cells, activated DP<sub>2</sub> triggers Gi alpha subunit-linked heterotrimeric G proteins to dissociate into their component '''a)''' [[Gi alpha subunit]]s (also termed Gi<sub>\u03b1</sub> subunits) inhibit [[adenylyl cyclase]] '''b)''' [[G beta-gamma complex]] of subunits (G<sub>\u03b2\u03b3</sub>) have many potential functions, including simulation of [[phospholipase C]] to cleave phosphatidylinositol triphosphate into [[inositol triphosphate]] (IP3) and [[diacylglycerol]] (DAG), inhibition or stimulation of [[adenylyl cyclase]] depending on the isoform, activation of GIRK channels and activation of GRK. IP3 raises cytosolic Ca<sup>2</sup> levels thereby regulating Ca<sup>2</sup>-sensitive signal pathways; DAG activates certain [[protein kinase C]] enzymes )PKCs) that phosphorylate and thereby regulate target proteins involved in cell signaling; and adenyl cyclase converts [[Adenosine monophosphate|AMP]] into [[cyclic AMP]] (cAMP) thereby down-regulating cAMP-responsive proteins involved in cell signalling.<ref name=\"pmid18946232\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Oguma T, Asano K, Ishizaka A | title = Role of prostaglandin D(2) and its receptors in the pathophysiology of asthma | journal = Allergology International | volume = 57 | issue = 4 | pages = 307\u201312 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18946232 | doi = 10.2332/allergolint.08-RAI-0033 | url = | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid21508345\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ricciotti E, FitzGerald GA | title = Prostaglandins and inflammation | journal = Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology | volume = 31 | issue = 5 | pages = 986\u20131000 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21508345 | pmc = 3081099 | doi = 10.1161/ATVBAHA.110.207449 | url = }}</ref> Concurrently with the mobilization of these pathways, activated DP<sub>2</sub> also mobilizes [[G protein-coupled receptor kinase]]s (GRKs, GRK2, GRK3, and/or GRK6) and [[Arrestin]]-2 (also termed [[Arrestin beta 1]] or \u03b2-arrestin).

DP<sub>2</sub> has also been designated as '''CD294''' ([[cluster of differentiation]] 294). It is a member of the class of [[prostaglandin receptors]] which bind with and respond to various [[prostaglandin]]s. DP<sub>2</sub> along with [[Prostaglandin DP1 receptor]] are receptors for [[prostaglandin D2]] (PGD2). Activation of DP<sub>2</sub> by PGD2 or other cognate [[receptor ligand]]s has been associated with certain physiological and pathological responses, particularly those associated with allergy and inflammation, in animal models and certain human diseases.\n\n==Gene==\nThe PTGDR2 gene is located on human chromosome 11 at position q12.2 (i.e. 11q12.2). It consists of two [[intron]]s and three [[exon]]s and codes for a [[G protein coupled receptor]] (GPCR) composed of 472 amino acids. DP<sub>2</sub>, is related to members of the [[chemotactic factor]] class of GPCRs, sharing an amino acid sequence identity of 29% with the [[C5a receptor]], [[Formyl peptide receptor 1]], and [[Formyl peptide receptor 2]] receptors. DP<sub>2</sub> has little or no such amino acid sequence relationship to the eight other [[Prostanoid receptor]]s (see [[Eicosanoid receptor#Prostenoid receptors]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?cmd=Retrieve&dopt=full_report&list_uids=11251|title= PTGDR2 prostaglandin D2 receptor 2|website = Gene Resources NCBI }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid10036181\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Marchese A, Sawzdargo M, Nguyen T, Cheng R, Heng HH, Nowak T, Im DS, Lynch KR, George SR, O'dowd BF | title = Discovery of three novel orphan G-protein-coupled receptors | journal = Genomics | volume = 56 | issue = 1 | pages = 12\u201321 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10036181 | doi = 10.1006/geno.1998.5655 | url = }}</ref>\n\n==Expression==\nDP<sub>2</sub> was found to stimulate the directed movement or [[chemotaxis]] of human T-helper type 2 cells (see [[T helper cell#Th1/Th2 Model for helper T cells]]) by binding to a receptor initially termed GPR44 and thereafter CRTH2 (for '''C'''hemoattractant '''R'''eceptor-homologous molecule expressed on '''T'''-'''H'''elper type 2 cells).

The [[cyclopentenone prostaglandins]], PGJ2, \u039412-PGJ2, and 15-d-\u039412,14-PGJ2 are spontaneously formed or protein-facilitated derivatives of PGD<sub>2</sub> that are generated in vitro as well as in vivo; these derivatives have binding affinities and activating potencies on DP<sub>2</sub> that are similar to PGD<sub>2</sub>. Studies suggest that at least some if not most or all of the cytotoxic effects of cylopenenone prostaglandin derivatives of PGD2 act independently of DP2. Certain metabolites and derivatives of PGD2 viz., 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGD2 and 15(S)-15-methyl-PGD2, are ~10-fold less active than PGD2 while the drug [[indomethacin]] is weak in activating DP<sub>2</sub>.<ref name=\"guidetopharmacology.org\"/>\n\n===Inhibiting ligands===\nThe following compounds are selective [[receptor antagonist]]s of and thereby inhibit the activation of DP<sub>2</sub>: [[fevipiprant]], [[setipiprant]], ADC-3680, AZD-1981, MK-1029, MK-7246, OC-459, OC000459, QAV-680, and TM30089.

DP<sub>2</sub> is classified as a \"contractile\" prostanoid receptor in that it can cause the contraction of smooth muscle. As evidenced by its initial discovery as a receptor for PGD<sub>2</sub> in T-helper type 2 cells, activated DP<sub>2</sub> triggers Gi alpha subunit-linked heterotrimeric G proteins to dissociate into their component '''a)''' [[Gi alpha subunit]]s (also termed Gi<sub>\u03b1</sub> subunits) inhibit [[adenylyl cyclase]] '''b)''' [[G beta-gamma complex]] of subunits (G<sub>\u03b2\u03b3</sub>) have many potential functions, including simulation of [[phospholipase C]] to cleave phosphatidylinositol triphosphate into [[inositol triphosphate]] (IP3) and [[diacylglycerol]] (DAG), inhibition or stimulation of [[adenylyl cyclase]] depending on the isoform, activation of GIRK channels and activation of GRK. IP3 raises cytosolic Ca<sup>2</sup> levels thereby regulating Ca<sup>2</sup>-sensitive signal pathways; DAG activates certain [[protein kinase C]] enzymes )PKCs) that phosphorylate and thereby regulate target proteins involved in cell signaling; and adenyl cyclase converts [[Adenosine monophosphate|AMP]] into [[cyclic AMP]] (cAMP) thereby down-regulating cAMP-responsive proteins involved in cell signalling.<ref name=\"pmid18946232\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Oguma T, Asano K, Ishizaka A | title = Role of prostaglandin D(2) and its receptors in the pathophysiology of asthma | journal = Allergology International | volume = 57 | issue = 4 | pages = 307\u201312 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18946232 | doi = 10.2332/allergolint.08-RAI-0033 | url = | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid21508345\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ricciotti E, FitzGerald GA | title = Prostaglandins and inflammation | journal = Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology | volume = 31 | issue = 5 | pages = 986\u20131000 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21508345 | pmc = 3081099 | doi = 10.1161/ATVBAHA.110.207449 | url = }}</ref> Concurrently with the mobilization of these pathways, activated DP<sub>2</sub> also mobilizes [[G protein-coupled receptor kinase]]s (GRKs, GRK2, GRK3, and/or GRK6) and [[Arrestin]]-2 (also termed [[Arrestin beta 1]] or \u03b2-arrestin).

{"title_page": "Political economy of climate change", "text_new": "'''Political economy of climate change''' is an approach that applies the [[political economy]] thinking of collective or political processes to study the critical issues surrounding the decision-making on climate change.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe ever-increasing awareness and urgency of [[climate change]] have pressured scholars to explore a better understanding of the multiple actors and influencing factors that affect the climate change negotiation, and to seek more effective solutions to [[Climate change mitigation|tackle climate change]]. Analyzing these extremely complex issues from a political economy perspective helps to explain the complex interactions between different stakeholders in response to climate change impacts and provides broader opportunities to achieve better implementation of [[Climate change policy|climate change policies]].\n\nClimate Change is first and foremost a political issue now that it has become a widely believed fact.  Before tackling the issue, it is important to determine how drastic the effects can be in order to address it in an appropriate manner. When dealing with climate change, the inhabitants of countries must see themselves as \u201cglobal citizens\u201d rather than separate entities if any real long-term progress is to be made. In accordance with a global perspective, countries balance legislation regarding climate change in a way that benefits developing nations while refraining from discouraging developed nations from contributing to the effort.\n\n== Introduction ==\n=== Background ===\nClimate change and [[global warming]] have become one of the most pressing [[environmental concerns]] and the greatest global challenges in society today. As this issue continues to dominate the international agenda, researchers from different academic sectors have for long been devoting great efforts to explore effective solutions to climate change, with technologists and planners devising ways of [[Climate change mitigation|mitigating]] and [[Climate change adaptation|adapting]] to climate change; economists estimating the cost of climate change and the cost of tackling it; development experts exploring the impact of climate change on social services and public goods. However, Cammack (2007)<ref name=\"one\">Cammack, D. (2007) ''Understanding the political economy of climate change is vital to tackling it'', Prepared by the [[Overseas Development Institute]] for UN Climate Change Conference in Bali, December 2007.</ref> points out two problems with many of the above discussions, namely the disconnection between the proposed solutions to climate change from different disciplines; and the devoid of politics in addressing climate change at the local level. Further, the issue of climate change is facing various other challenges, such as the problem of elite-resource capture, the resource constraints in [[Developing country|developing countries]] and the conflicts that frequently result from such constraints, which have often been less concerned and stressed in suggested solutions. In recognition of these problems, it is advocated that \u201cunderstanding the political economy of climate change is vital to tackling it\u201d.<ref name=\"one\"/> \n\nMeanwhile, the unequal distribution of the impacts of climate change and the resulting inequity and unfairness on the poor who contribute least to the problem have linked the issue of climate change with development study,<ref>Adger, W.N., Paavola, Y., Huq, S. and Mace, M.J.

While the development of international agreements has witnessed a progressive step of global political action, this globally-led governance of climate change issue may be unable to provide adequate flexibility for specific national or sub-national conditions. Besides, from the development perspective of view, the issue of equity and global environmental justice would require a fair international regime within which the impact of [[climate change and poverty]] could be simultaneously prevented. In this context, climate change is not only a global crisis that needs the presence of international politics, but also a challenge for national or [[Sub-national entity|sub-national]] governments. The understanding of the political economy of climate change could explain the formulation and translation of international initiatives to specific national and sub-national policy context, which provides an important perspective to tackle climate change and achieve [[environmental justice]].<ref name=\"six\" />\n* '''The growth of climate change finance''': Recent years have witnessed a growing number of financial flows and the development of financing mechanisms in the climate change arena. The [[2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in [[Cancun]], Mexico has committed a significant amount of money from [[developed countries]] to developing a world in supportive of the adaptation and mitigation technologies. In short terms, the fast start finance will be transferred through various channels including bilateral and multilateral official development assistance, the [[Global Environment Facility]], and the [[UNFCCC]].<ref>Harmeling, S. and Kaloga, A. (2011)'[https://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/opendocs/bitstream/handle/123456789/7604/IDSB_42_3_10.1111-j.1759-5436.2011.00219.x.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y Understanding the Political Economy of the Adaptation Fund]', ''IDS Bulletin Special Issue: Political Economy of Climate Change'', '''42'''(3): 23-32</ref> Besides, a growing number of public funds have provided greater incentives to tackle climate change in developing countries. For instance, the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience aims at creating an integrated and scaled-up approach of climate change adaptation in some low-income countries and preparing for future finance flows. In addition, climate change finance in developing countries could potentially change the traditional aid mechanisms, through the differential interpretations of [[Kyoto Protocol|\u2018common but differentiated responsibilities\u2019]] by developing and developed countries.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Okereke | first1 = C | year = 2008 | title = Equity Norms in Global Environmental Governance | url = | journal = Global Environmental Politics | volume = 8 | issue = 3| pages = 25\u201350 | doi=10.1162/glep.2008.8.3.25}}</ref> Based on equity and [[climate justice]], climate change resource flows are increasingly called on the developed world according to the culpability for damages.<ref>Abdullah, A., Muyungi, R., Jallow, B., Reazuddin, M. and Konate, M.

Within these contexts, the understanding of the political economy processes of financial flows in the climate change arena would be crucial to effectively govern the resource transfer and to tackling climate change.<ref name=\"six\" />\n* '''Different [[ideological]] worldviews of responding to climate change''': Nowadays, because of the perception of science as a dominant policy driver, much of the policy prescription and action in climate change arena have concentrated on assumptions around standardized governance and planning systems, linear policy processes, readily transferable technology, economic rationality, and the ability of science and technology to overcome resource gaps.<ref>Leach, M., Scoones, I. and Stirling, A. (2010), ''Dynamic Sustainabilities\u2013Technology, Environment, Social Justice'', London: [[Earthscan]].</ref> As a result, there tends to be a bias towards technology-led and managerial approaches to address climate change in apolitical terms.

Analyzing these extremely complex issues from a political economy perspective helps to explain the complex interactions between different stakeholders in response to climate change impacts and provides broader opportunities to achieve better implementation of [[Climate change policy|climate change policies]].\n\nClimate Change is first and foremost a political issue now that it has become a widely believed fact.  Before tackling the issue, it is important to determine how drastic the effects can be in order to address it in an appropriate manner. When dealing with climate change, the inhabitants of countries must see themselves as \u201cglobal citizens\u201d rather than separate entities if any real long-term progress is to be made. In accordance with a global perspective, countries balance legislation regarding climate change in a way that benefits developing nations while refraining from discouraging developed nations from contributing to the effort.\n\n== Introduction ==\n=== Background ===\nClimate change and [[global warming]] have become one of the most pressing [[environmental concerns]] and the greatest global challenges in society today. As this issue continues to dominate the international agenda, researchers from different academic sectors have for long been devoting great efforts to explore effective solutions to climate change, with technologists and planners devising ways of [[Climate change mitigation|mitigating]] and [[Climate change adaptation|adapting]] to climate change; economists estimating the cost of climate change and the cost of tackling it; development experts exploring the impact of climate change on social services and public goods. However, Cammack (2007)<ref name=\"one\">Cammack, D. (2007) ''Understanding the political economy of climate change is vital to tackling it'', Prepared by the [[Overseas Development Institute]] for UN Climate Change Conference in Bali, December 2007.</ref> points out two problems with many of the above discussions, namely the disconnection between the proposed solutions to climate change from different disciplines; and the devoid of politics in addressing climate change at the local level. Further, the issue of climate change is facing various other challenges, such as the problem of elite-resource capture, the resource constraints in [[Developing country|developing countries]] and the conflicts that frequently result from such constraints, which have often been less concerned and stressed in suggested solutions. In recognition of these problems, it is advocated that \u201cunderstanding the political economy of climate change is vital to tackling it\u201d.<ref name=\"one\"/> \n\nMeanwhile, the unequal distribution of the impacts of climate change and the resulting inequity and unfairness on the poor who contribute least to the problem have linked the issue of climate change with development study,<ref>Adger, W.N., Paavola, Y., Huq, S. and Mace, M.J.

While the development of international agreements has witnessed a progressive step of global political action, this globally-led governance of climate change issue may be unable to provide adequate flexibility for specific national or sub-national conditions. Besides, from the development perspective of view, the issue of equity and global environmental justice would require a fair international regime within which the impact of [[climate change and poverty]] could be simultaneously prevented. In this context, climate change is not only a global crisis that needs the presence of international politics, but also a challenge for national or [[Sub-national entity|sub-national]] governments. The understanding of the political economy of climate change could explain the formulation and translation of international initiatives to specific national and sub-national policy context, which provides an important perspective to tackle climate change and achieve [[environmental justice]].<ref name=\"six\" />\n* '''The growth of climate change finance''': Recent years have witnessed a growing number of financial flows and the development of financing mechanisms in the climate change arena.

On June 24, 2000, an English-language version of the episode aired on [[Kids' WB]] as \"Beauty and the Beach\". Promoted as a \"lost episode\" special presentation, it has only received one rerun and has not yet been shown elsewhere, nor was it included in the English Indigo League DVD boxset or the English Indigo League Champions Edition Blu-ray boxset released in November 2017.\n\nIn this episode, the female characters all enter a beauty contest. [[Team Rocket]] also enters, with James donning a suit with inflatable breasts. One scene of the episode involved James showing off his artificial breasts for humorous effect, taunting Misty by saying: \"Maybe, one day when you're older, you'll have a chest like this!\" In one scene, he puffs up his breasts to over twice their original size. When it was dubbed and aired in 2000, all scenes of James in a bikini (about 40 seconds) were edited. There were a number of other sexualized scenes, such as one in which Ash and Brock are stunned at the sight of Misty in a bikini and another in which an older man appears to be attracted to her. In addition, all Japanese text on signs, etc. remains intact in this episode, as opposed to other first-season episodes in which it was digitally replaced with English text.\n\nA continuity problem created with this episode's removal is due to a flashback in \"Hypno's Naptime\" Also, this episode marks the first time chronologically that Misty and Brock meet Gary and Delia.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dogasu |url=http://dogasu.bulbagarden.net/comparisons/kanto/ep027.html |title=Japanese Episode 027 |publisher=Dogasu.bulbagarden.net |date= |accessdate=2010-04-09}}</ref>\n\n====\"The Legend of Miniryu\" (Episode 35)====\n{{nihongo|\"The Legend of Miniryu ([[Dratini]])\"|\u30df\u30cb\u30ea\u30e5\u30a6\u306e\u3067\u3093\u305b\u3064|Miniry\u016b no Densetsu}} was the second episode to be banned by 4Kids Entertainment.

It was originally skipped by [[4Licensing Corporation|4Kids Entertainment]] upon the original American broadcast of the series until 2000. On June 24, 2000, an English-language version of the episode aired on [[Kids' WB]] as \"Beauty and the Beach\". Promoted as a \"lost episode\" special presentation, it has only received one rerun and has not yet been shown elsewhere, nor was it included in the English Indigo League DVD boxset or the English Indigo League Champions Edition Blu-ray boxset released in November 2017.\n\nIn this episode, the female characters all enter a beauty contest. [[Team Rocket]] also enters, with James donning a suit with inflatable breasts. One scene of the episode involved James showing off his artificial breasts for humorous effect, taunting Misty by saying: \"Maybe, one day when you're older, you'll have a chest like this!\" In one scene, he puffs up his breasts to over twice their original size. When it was dubbed and aired in 2000, all scenes of James in a bikini (about 40 seconds) were edited. There were a number of other sexualized scenes, such as one in which Ash and Brock are stunned at the sight of Misty in a bikini and another in which an older man appears to be attracted to her. In addition, all Japanese text on signs, etc. remains intact in this episode, as opposed to other first-season episodes in which it was digitally replaced with English text.\n\nA continuity problem created with this episode's removal is due to a flashback in \"Hypno's Naptime\" Also, this episode marks the first time chronologically that Misty and Brock meet Gary and Delia.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dogasu |url=http://dogasu.bulbagarden.net/comparisons/kanto/ep027.html |title=Japanese Episode 027 |publisher=Dogasu.bulbagarden.net |date= |accessdate=2010-04-09}}</ref>\n\n====\"The Legend of Miniryu\" (Episode 35)====\n{{nihongo|\"The Legend of Miniryu ([[Dratini]])\"|\u30df\u30cb\u30ea\u30e5\u30a6\u306e\u3067\u3093\u305b\u3064|Miniry\u016b no Densetsu}} was the second episode to be banned by 4Kids Entertainment.

In the early 1960s, he moved on to [[movie]] soundtracks and [[television]], as well as session work for the likes of the [[Beach Boys]], [[Sonny and Cher]] and various [[Phil Spector]] productions. His Beach Boys contributions include the climactic [[timpani]] during the choruses of \"[[Do You Wanna Dance?]]\" and prominent vibraphone on \"[[Let's Go Away for Awhile]].\"\n\nHe began his long and successful association with Herb Alpert and his [[Tijuana Brass]] when he played percussion on the Tijuana Brass's first hit, \"[[The Lonely Bull]]\", in 1962. He later composed \"Spanish Flea\". Playing marimba and vibes on many of the songs on Alpert's subsequent albums in the 1960s, as well as writing at least one song on most of those albums, Wechter contributed much to the Tijuana Brass sound and style without receiving public credit for it at the time.\n\nEncouraged by Alpert, Wechter formed the [[Baja Marimba Band]] {{Circa|1963}} and was quite successful.<ref>The single \"Comin' In The Back Door\" is reported to have been released in November 1963. http://www.45cat.com/record/201us7.

In the early 1960s, he moved on to [[movie]] soundtracks and [[television]], as well as session work for the likes of the [[Beach Boys]], [[Sonny and Cher]] and various [[Phil Spector]] productions. His Beach Boys contributions include the climactic [[timpani]] during the choruses of \"[[Do You Wanna Dance?]]\" and prominent vibraphone on \"[[Let's Go Away for Awhile]].\"\n\nHe began his long and successful association with Herb Alpert and his [[Tijuana Brass]] when he played percussion on the Tijuana Brass's first hit, \"[[The Lonely Bull]]\", in 1962. He later composed \"Spanish Flea\". Playing marimba and vibes on many of the songs on Alpert's subsequent albums in the 1960s, as well as writing at least one song on most of those albums, Wechter contributed much to the Tijuana Brass sound and style without receiving public credit for it at the time.\n\nEncouraged by Alpert, Wechter formed the [[Baja Marimba Band]] {{Circa|1963}} and was quite successful.<ref>The single \"Comin' In The Back Door\" is reported to have been released in November 1963. http://www.45cat.com/record/201us7.

Evidence suggests dysfunction in supraspinal descending inhibitory pain pathways may contribute to the pathogenesis of central sensitization in CTTH.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n====Neuronal receptors and neurotransmitters====\n\nSpecific neuronal receptors and neurotransmitters thought to be most involved include [[NMDA receptor|NMDA]] and [[AMPA receptor|AMPA]] receptors, [[Glutamate (neurotransmitter)|glutamate]], [[serotonin]] (5-HT), [[Beta-Endorphin|\u03b2-endorphin]], and [[nitric oxide]] (NO).<ref name=\":7\" /> Of the neurotransmitters, NO plays a major role in central pain pathways and likely contributes to the process of central sensitization.<ref name=\":7\" /> Briefly, the enzyme [[nitric oxide synthase]] (NOS) forms NO which ultimately results in vasodilatation and activation of central nervous system pain pathways.<ref name=\":7\" /> Serotonin may also be of significant importance and involved in malfunctioning pain filter located in the brain stem. The view is that the brain misinterprets information\u2014for example from the temporal muscle or other muscles\u2014and interprets this signal as pain. Evidence for this theory comes from the fact that chronic tension-type headaches may be successfully treated with certain antidepressants such as [[nortriptyline]]. However, the analgesic effect of nortriptyline, as well as amitriptyline in chronic tension-type headache, is not solely due to serotonin reuptake inhibition, and likely other mechanisms are involved.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ashina M, Lassen LH, Bendtsen L, Jensen R, Olesen J | title = Effect of inhibition of nitric oxide synthase on chronic tension-type headache: a randomised crossover trial | journal = Lancet | volume = 353 | issue = 9149 | pages = 287\u20139 | date = January 1999 | pmid = 9929022 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(98)01079-4 }}</ref><ref name=\":7\" />\n\n====Role of synaptic level====\nRegarding synaptic level changes, homosynaptic facilitation and heterosynaptic facilitation are both likely to be involved in central sensitization.<ref name=\":7\" /> '''Homosynaptic facilitation''' occurs when synapses '''normally''' involved in pain pathways undergo changes involving receptors on the post-synaptic membrane as well as the molecular pathways activated upon synaptic transmission. Lower pain thresholds of CTTH result from this homosynaptic facilitation. In contrast, '''heterosynaptic facilitation''' occurs when synapses '''not normally''' involved in pain pathways become involved. Once this occurs innocuous signals are interpreted as painful signals. Allodynia and hyperalgesia of CTTH represent this heterosynaptic facilitation clinically.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n====Stress====\nThroughout TTH literature stress is mentioned as a factor and may be implicated via the adrenal axis. This ultimately results in downstream activation of NMDA receptor activation, [[NF\u03baB]] activation, and upregulation of [[Nitric oxide synthase|iNOS]] with subsequent production of NO leading to pain as described above.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nWith TTH the physical exam is expected to be normal with perhaps the exception of either pericranial tenderness upon [[palpation]] of the cranial muscles, or presence of either [[photophobia]] or [[phonophobia]].<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=Ferri's Clinical Advisor|last=Smith|first=Jonathan|publisher=Elsevier|year=2019|isbn=978-0-323-53042-2|location=Philadelphia|pages=1348}}</ref>\n\n=== Differential Diagnosis:<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=Rosen's emergency medicine : concepts and clinical practice|others=Walls, Ron M.; Hockberger, Robert S.; Gausche-Hill, Marianne|isbn=9780323390163|edition=Ninth|location=Philadelphia, PA|pages=1269|oclc=989157341|last1 = Walls|first1 = Ron|last2=Hockberger|first2=Robert|last3=Gausche-Hill|first3=Marianne|date=2017-03-09}}</ref> ===\n\n*[[Migraine]]\n* Oromandibular dysfunction \n* Sinus disease\n* Eye disease\n* Cervical spine disease\n* Infection in immunocompromised\n* Intracranial mass\n* [[Idiopathic intracranial hypertension]] \n*[[Medication overuse headache]]\n* Secondary headache (headache due to other disorder)\n*[[Giant-cell arteritis|Giant cell arteritis]] ( \u226550 years of age)\n*[[Dermatochalasis]]\n\n=== Workup<ref name=\":3\" /> ===\nExtensive testing is not needed as TTH is diagnosed by history and physical.

in small evening dose), and muscle relaxants. The most commonly utilized TCA is amitriptyline due to the postulated role in decreasing central sensitization and analgesic relief. Another popular TCA used is Doxepine. SSRIs may also be utilized for management of CTTH. For patients with concurrent muscle spasm and CTTH, the muscle relaxant Tizanidine can be a helpful option.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThese medications however, are not effective if concurrent overuse of over the counter medications or other analgesics is occurring.<ref name=\":5\" /> Stopping overuse must occur prior to proceeding with other forms of treatment.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n=== Exercise therapy ===\nEvidence has supported that simple yet effective Cranio-cervical (Neck) exercises and Cervico-scapular (shoulder) exercises are effective in managing ETTH and CTTH for headaches associated with neck pain.

Evidence suggests dysfunction in supraspinal descending inhibitory pain pathways may contribute to the pathogenesis of central sensitization in CTTH.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n====Neuronal receptors and neurotransmitters====\n\nSpecific neuronal receptors and neurotransmitters thought to be most involved include [[NMDA receptor|NMDA]] and [[AMPA receptor|AMPA]] receptors, [[Glutamate (neurotransmitter)|glutamate]], [[serotonin]] (5-HT), [[Beta-Endorphin|\u03b2-endorphin]], and [[nitric oxide]] (NO).<ref name=\":7\" /> Of the neurotransmitters, NO plays a major role in central pain pathways and likely contributes to the process of central sensitization.<ref name=\":7\" /> Briefly, the enzyme [[nitric oxide synthase]] (NOS) forms NO which ultimately results in vasodilatation and activation of central nervous system pain pathways.<ref name=\":7\" /> Serotonin may also be of significant importance and involved in malfunctioning pain filter located in the brain stem. The view is that the brain misinterprets information\u2014for example from the temporal muscle or other muscles\u2014and interprets this signal as pain. Evidence for this theory comes from the fact that chronic tension-type headaches may be successfully treated with certain antidepressants such as [[nortriptyline]]. However, the analgesic effect of nortriptyline, as well as amitriptyline in chronic tension-type headache, is not solely due to serotonin reuptake inhibition, and likely other mechanisms are involved.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ashina M, Lassen LH, Bendtsen L, Jensen R, Olesen J | title = Effect of inhibition of nitric oxide synthase on chronic tension-type headache: a randomised crossover trial | journal = Lancet | volume = 353 | issue = 9149 | pages = 287\u20139 | date = January 1999 | pmid = 9929022 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(98)01079-4 }}</ref><ref name=\":7\" />\n\n====Role of synaptic level====\nRegarding synaptic level changes, homosynaptic facilitation and heterosynaptic facilitation are both likely to be involved in central sensitization.<ref name=\":7\" /> '''Homosynaptic facilitation''' occurs when synapses '''normally''' involved in pain pathways undergo changes involving receptors on the post-synaptic membrane as well as the molecular pathways activated upon synaptic transmission. Lower pain thresholds of CTTH result from this homosynaptic facilitation. In contrast, '''heterosynaptic facilitation''' occurs when synapses '''not normally''' involved in pain pathways become involved. Once this occurs innocuous signals are interpreted as painful signals. Allodynia and hyperalgesia of CTTH represent this heterosynaptic facilitation clinically.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n====Stress====\nAs a final point, throughout TTH literature stress is mentioned as a factor and may be implicated via the adrenal axis. This ultimately results in downstream activation of NMDA receptor activation, [[NF\u03baB]] activation, and upregulation of [[Nitric oxide synthase|iNOS]] with subsequent production of NO leading to pain as described above.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nWith TTH the physical exam is expected to be normal with perhaps the exception of either pericranial tenderness upon [[palpation]] of the cranial muscles, or presence of either [[photophobia]] or [[phonophobia]].<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=Ferri's Clinical Advisor|last=Smith|first=Jonathan|publisher=Elsevier|year=2019|isbn=978-0-323-53042-2|location=Philadelphia|pages=1348}}</ref>\n\n=== Differential Diagnosis:<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=Rosen's emergency medicine : concepts and clinical practice|others=Walls, Ron M.; Hockberger, Robert S.; Gausche-Hill, Marianne|isbn=9780323390163|edition=Ninth|location=Philadelphia, PA|pages=1269|oclc=989157341|last1 = Walls|first1 = Ron|last2=Hockberger|first2=Robert|last3=Gausche-Hill|first3=Marianne|date=2017-03-09}}</ref> ===\n\n*[[Migraine]]\n* Oromandibular dysfunction \n* Sinus disease\n* Eye disease\n* Cervical spine disease\n* Infection in immunocompromised\n* Intracranial mass\n* [[Idiopathic intracranial hypertension]] \n*[[Medication overuse headache]]\n* Secondary headache (headache due to other disorder)\n*[[Giant-cell arteritis|Giant cell arteritis]] ( \u226550 years of age)\n*[[Dermatochalasis]]\n\n=== Workup<ref name=\":3\" /> ===\nExtensive testing is not needed as TTH is diagnosed by history and physical.

Based on this, the jurisprudence has developed along the lines of affording immunity from prosecution to foreign states in domestic courts. In ''[[The Schooner Exchange v.

This theory of recognition was developed in the 19th century. Under it, a state was sovereign if another sovereign state recognised it as such. Because of this, new states could not immediately become part of the international community or be bound by international law, and recognised nations did not have to respect international law in their dealings with them.<ref name=\"ctos\">{{cite book |title=Sourcebook on Public International Law |last=Hillier |first=Tim |year=1998 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-85941-050-9 |pages=201\u20132 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kr0sOuIx8q8C }}</ref> In 1815, at the [[Congress of Vienna]] the [[Final Act of the Congress of Vienna|Final Act]] recognised only 39 sovereign states in the European diplomatic system, and as a result it was firmly established that in the future new states would have to be recognised by other states, and that meant in practice recognition by one or more of the [[great power]]s.<ref>Kalevi Jaakko Holsti ''Taming the Sovereigns'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=Jh6gjr-2ho8C&pg=PA128&dq=Final+Act+of+the+Congress+of+Vienna&lr=&sig=ACfU3U1FTkJPODAK8KkyGV5Nz6O-ke9_Ig p. 128].</ref>\n\nOne of the major criticisms of this law is the confusion caused when some states recognise a new entity, but other states do not. Hersch Lauterpacht, one of the theory's main proponents, suggested that it is a state's duty to grant recognition as a possible solution. However, a state may use any criteria when judging if they should give recognition and they have no obligation to use such criteria. Many states may only recognise another state if it is to their advantage.<ref name=\"ctos\" />\n\nIn 1912, [[L. F. L. Oppenheim]] said the following, regarding constitutive theory:\n\n{{quote|International Law does not say that a State is not in existence as long as it is not recognised, but it takes no notice of it before its recognition.

According to declarative theory, an entity's statehood is independent of its recognition by other states, as long as the sovereignty was not gained by military force. The declarative model was most famously expressed in the 1933 [[Montevideo Convention]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Hersch Lauterpacht|title=Recognition in International Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EWgEv1Qq2TwC&pg=PA419|year=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=419|isbn=9781107609433}}</ref>\n\nArticle 3 of the Montevideo Convention declares that political statehood is independent of recognition by other states, and the state is not prohibited from defending itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oas.org/juridico/english/treaties/a-40.html|title=CONVENTION ON RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF STATES|website=www.oas.org}}</ref> In contrast, recognition is considered a requirement for statehood by the constitutive theory of statehood. An important part of the convention was Article 11 that prohibits using military force to gain sovereignty.\n\nA similar opinion about \"the conditions on which an entity constitutes a state\" is expressed by the [[European Economic Community]] ''Opinions of the [[Badinter Arbitration Committee]]'', which found that a state was defined by having a territory, a population, government, and capacity to enter into relations with other states.<ref>{{cite book|last=Castellino|first=Joshua|title=International Law and Self-Determination: The Interplay of the Politics of Territorial Possession With Formulations of Post-Colonial National Identity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uGMxfj4oedEC|year=2000|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=978-90-411-1409-9|page=[https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=uGMxfj4oedEC&pg=PA77 77]}}</ref>\n\n===State recognition===\n{{also|List of states with limited recognition}}\nState practice relating to the recognition of states typically falls somewhere between the declaratory and constitutive approaches.<ref>{{cite book |title=International law |first1=Malcolm Nathan |last1=Shaw |year=2003 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=369 |edition=5th |isbn=978-0-521-53183-2 }}</ref> International law does not require a state to recognise other states.<ref>Opinion No. 10. of the [[Arbitration Commission of the Conference on Yugoslavia]].</ref> Recognition is often withheld when a new state is seen as illegitimate or has come about in breach of international law.

Therefore, it has been argued that states belong to a third category, the quasi-abstract, that has recently begun to garner philosophical attention, especially in the area of [[documentality]], an ontological theory that seeks to understand the role of documents in understanding all of social reality. Quasi-abstract objects, such as states, can be brought into being through document acts, and can also be used to manipulate them, such as by binding them by treaty or surrendering them as the result of a war.<ref name=\"dl.dropboxusercontent.com\"/>\n\nScholars in international relations can be broken up into two different practices, realists and pluralists, of what they believe the ontological state of the state is. Realists believe that the world is one of only states and interstate relations and the identity of the state is defined before any international relations with other states. On the other hand, pluralists believe that the state is not the only actor in international relations and interactions between states and the state is competing against many other actors.<ref name=MariahSutt2>{{cite journal|last1=Ringmar|first1=Erik|title=On the Ontological Status of the State|journal=European Journal of International Relations|date=1996|volume=10|issue=2}}</ref>\n\n===The state as \"spiritual entity\"===\nAnother theory of the ontology of the state is that the state is a spiritual,<ref name=Fundamentals71>{{harvnb|Schmandt|Steinbicker|1954|p=71}}</ref> or \"mystical entity\"<ref name=Fundamentals71/> with its own being, distinct from the members of the state.<ref name=Fundamentals71/> The German [[Idealism|Idealist]] philosopher [[Georg Hegel]] (1770\u20131831) was perhaps the greatest proponent of this theory.<ref name=Fundamentals71/> The Hegelian definition of the state is \"the Divine Idea as it exists on Earth\".<ref>{{harvnb|Schmandt|Steinbicker|1954|p=71}} (citing Hegel's ''Philosophy of History'', trans.

First articulated by [[Jean Bodin]], the powers of the state are considered to be ''suprema potestas'' within territorial boundaries. Based on this, the jurisprudence has developed along the lines of affording immunity from prosecution to foreign states in domestic courts. In ''[[The Schooner Exchange v. M'Faddon]]'', Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] of the [[United States Supreme Court]] wrote that the \"perfect equality and absolute independence of sovereigns\" has created a class of cases where \"every sovereign is understood to waive the exercise of a part of that complete exclusive territorial jurisdiction, which has been stated to be the attribute of every nation\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Simpson|first=Gerry|title=Great Powers and Outlaw States: Unequal Sovereigns in the International Legal Order|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VaIlYocvQO0C&pg=PA35 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=2004|isbn=9780521534901}}</ref><ref name=bankas>{{cite book|last=Bankas|first=Ernest K|title=The State Immunity Controversy in International Law: Private Suits Against Sovereign States in Domestic Courts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dv8PuKLGe1MC|publisher=Springer|date=2005|isbn=9783540256953}}</ref>\n\nAbsolute sovereign immunity is no longer as widely accepted as it has been in the past, and some countries including the United States, [[Canada]], [[Singapore]], [[Australia]], [[Pakistan]] and [[South Africa]] have introduced [[restrictive immunity]] by statute, which explicitly limits jurisdictional immunity to public acts, but not private or commercial ones, though there is no precise definition by which public acts can easily be distinguished from private ones.<ref name=bankas />\n\n==Recognition==\nState recognition signifies the decision of a sovereign state to treat another entity as also being a sovereign state.<ref>[http://www.answers.com/topic/recognition \"Recognition\"], ''Encyclopedia of American Foreign Policy''.</ref> Recognition can be either expressed or implied and is usually retroactive in its effects.

This theory of recognition was developed in the 19th century. Under it, a state was sovereign if another sovereign state recognised it as such. Because of this, new states could not immediately become part of the international community or be bound by international law, and recognised nations did not have to respect international law in their dealings with them.<ref name=\"ctos\">{{cite book |title=Sourcebook on Public International Law |last=Hillier |first=Tim |year=1998 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-85941-050-9 |pages=201\u20132 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kr0sOuIx8q8C }}</ref> In 1815, at the [[Congress of Vienna]] the [[Final Act of the Congress of Vienna|Final Act]] recognised only 39 sovereign states in the European diplomatic system, and as a result it was firmly established that in the future new states would have to be recognised by other states, and that meant in practice recognition by one or more of the [[great power]]s.<ref>Kalevi Jaakko Holsti ''Taming the Sovereigns'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=Jh6gjr-2ho8C&pg=PA128&dq=Final+Act+of+the+Congress+of+Vienna&lr=&sig=ACfU3U1FTkJPODAK8KkyGV5Nz6O-ke9_Ig p. 128].</ref>\n\nOne of the major criticisms of this law is the confusion caused when some states recognise a new entity, but other states do not. Hersch Lauterpacht, one of the theory's main proponents, suggested that it is a state's duty to grant recognition as a possible solution. However, a state may use any criteria when judging if they should give recognition and they have no obligation to use such criteria. Many states may only recognise another state if it is to their advantage.<ref name=\"ctos\" />\n\nIn 1912, [[L. F. L. Oppenheim]] said the following, regarding constitutive theory:\n\n{{quote|International Law does not say that a State is not in existence as long as it is not recognised, but it takes no notice of it before its recognition.

According to declarative theory, an entity's statehood is independent of its recognition by other states, as long as the sovereignty was not gained by military force. The declarative model was most famously expressed in the 1933 [[Montevideo Convention]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Hersch Lauterpacht|title=Recognition in International Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EWgEv1Qq2TwC&pg=PA419|year=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=419|isbn=9781107609433}}</ref>\n\nArticle 3 of the Montevideo Convention declares that political statehood is independent of recognition by other states, and the state is not prohibited from defending itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oas.org/juridico/english/treaties/a-40.html|title=CONVENTION ON RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF STATES|website=www.oas.org}}</ref> In contrast, recognition is considered a requirement for statehood by the constitutive theory of statehood. An important part of the convention was Article 11 that prohibits using military force to gain sovereignty.\n\nA similar opinion about \"the conditions on which an entity constitutes a state\" is expressed by the [[European Economic Community]] ''Opinions of the [[Badinter Arbitration Committee]]'', which found that a state was defined by having a territory, a population, government, and capacity to enter into relations with other states.<ref>{{cite book|last=Castellino|first=Joshua|title=International Law and Self-Determination: The Interplay of the Politics of Territorial Possession With Formulations of Post-Colonial National Identity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uGMxfj4oedEC|year=2000|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=978-90-411-1409-9|page=[https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=uGMxfj4oedEC&pg=PA77 77]}}</ref>\n\n===State recognition===\n{{also|List of states with limited recognition}}\nState practice relating to the recognition of states typically falls somewhere between the declaratory and constitutive approaches.<ref>{{cite book |title=International law |first1=Malcolm Nathan |last1=Shaw |year=2003 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=369 |edition=5th |isbn=978-0-521-53183-2 }}</ref> International law does not require a state to recognise other states.<ref>Opinion No. 10. of the [[Arbitration Commission of the Conference on Yugoslavia]].</ref> Recognition is often withheld when a new state is seen as illegitimate or has come about in breach of international law.

Therefore, it has been argued that states belong to a third category, the quasi-abstract, that has recently begun to garner philosophical attention, especially in the area of [[documentality]], an ontological theory that seeks to understand the role of documents in understanding all of social reality. Quasi-abstract objects, such as states, can be brought into being through document acts, and can also be used to manipulate them, such as by binding them by treaty or surrendering them as the result of a war.<ref name=\"dl.dropboxusercontent.com\"/>\n\nScholars in international relations can be broken up into two different practices, realists and pluralists, of what they believe the ontological state of the state is. Realists believe that the world is one of only states and interstate relations and the identity of the state is defined before any international relations with other states. On the other hand, pluralists believe that the state is not the only actor in international relations and interactions between states and the state is competing against many other actors.<ref name=MariahSutt2>{{cite journal|last1=Ringmar|first1=Erik|title=On the Ontological Status of the State|journal=European Journal of International Relations|date=1996|volume=10|issue=2}}</ref>\n\n===The state as \"spiritual entity\"===\nAnother theory of the ontology of the state is that the state is a spiritual,<ref name=Fundamentals71>{{harvnb|Schmandt|Steinbicker|1954|p=71}}</ref> or \"mystical entity\"<ref name=Fundamentals71/> with its own being, distinct from the members of the state.<ref name=Fundamentals71/> The German [[Idealism|Idealist]] philosopher [[Georg Hegel]] (1770\u20131831) was perhaps the greatest proponent of this theory.<ref name=Fundamentals71/> The Hegelian definition of the state is \"the Divine Idea as it exists on Earth\".<ref>{{harvnb|Schmandt|Steinbicker|1954|p=71}} (citing Hegel's ''Philosophy of History'', trans.
