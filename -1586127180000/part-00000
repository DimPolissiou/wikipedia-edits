Meanwhile, in a place deep inside the Earth known as the \"Healing Garden\", everything is in ruins after an attack from an antagonistic group called the Byougens, whose goal is to infect the garden and slowly poison the planet. Its ruler, Teatine, entrusted the care of her daughter Latte to the \"medical trainee\" Healing Animals: Rabirin, Pegitan and Nyatoran, on a mission to go to the surface world and find three people whose hearts can resonate with their paws and can partner with them. While on Earth, the fairies witness an attack from the Byougens. In a sudden twist of fate, Rabirin meets up with Nodoka who, despite her somewhat frail condition, is determined to protect others. This determination resonated with Rabirin and resulted in Nodoka becoming the Pretty Cure foretold in legend, Cure Grace.

It is seventeenth series in the ''[[Pretty Cure]]'' franchise, featuring the fifteenth generation of Cures. It is directed by Yoko Ikeda and written by Junko Kamura. The series began airing on all [[All-Nippon News Network|ANN]] stations in Japan on February 2, 2020, succeeding ''[[Star Twinkle PreCure]]'' in its initial time slot. It is the second series in the franchise to have nature as its main topic since ''[[Pretty Cure Splash Star]]'', with elements and medicine used for the Cure's main motifs.\n\n==Story==\n13-year old Nodoka Hanadera just recently moved to the town of Sukoyaka with her family in hopes that it can give her a fresh start from her life in the city. Meanwhile, in a place deep inside the Earth known as the \"Healing Garden\", everything is in ruins after an attack from an antagonistic group called the Byougens, whose goal is to infect the garden and slowly poison the planet. Its ruler, Teatine, entrusted the care of her daughter Latte to the \"medical trainee\" Healing Animals: Rabirin, Pegitan and Nyatoran, on a mission to go to the surface world and find three people whose hearts can resonate with their paws and can partner with them. While on Earth, the fairies witness an attack from the Byougens. In a sudden twist of fate, Rabirin meets up with Nodoka who, despite her somewhat frail condition, is determined to protect others. This determination resonated with Rabirin and resulted in Nodoka becoming the Pretty Cure foretold in legend, Cure Grace. Joined in by Chiyu/Cure Fontaine and Hinata/Cure Sparkle, they all form the Healin' Good Pretty Cure team in order to fight against the threat of the Byougens and protect all life on Earth and the Healing Garden.\n\n==Characters==\n===Pretty Cures===\n;{{nihongo|Nodoka Hanadera|\u82b1\u5bfa\u306e\u3069\u304b|Hanadera Nodoka}} / {{nihongo|Cure Grace|\u30ad\u30e5\u30a2\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9|Kyua Gur\u0113su}}<ref name=HPR>{{cite news|date=26 December 2019|url=https://www.cinematoday.jp/news/N0113206|work=Cinematoday|language=Japanese|accessdate=25 December 2019|title=\u300c\u30d2\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u3063\u3069\u3000\u30d7\u30ea\u30ad\u30e5\u30a2\u300d\u58f0\u512a\u306b\u60a0\u6728\u78a7\uff01\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3\u30ad\u30e3\u30b9\u30c8\u767a\u8868}}</ref>\n:{{anime voice|[[Aoi Y\u016bki]]}}<ref name=HPR/>\n:A girl who is the pink-colored Pretty Cure of Flowers, her fairy partner is Rabirin<ref name=HPR/> and has moved to Sukoyaka City.

He attained the rank of [[Lieutenant general (United States)|lieutenant general]] during his life; he was killed in action during World War II, and received a posthumous promotion to [[General (United States)|general]].\n\nA [[Minnesota]] native and 1904 graduate of the [[United States Military Academy]], McNair was a [[Field Artillery Branch (United States)|Field Artillery]] officer with a background in the [[Ordnance Corps (United States Army)|Ordnance Department]].  A veteran of the [[United States occupation of Veracruz|Veracruz occupation]] and [[Pancho Villa Expedition]], during World War I he served as assistant chief of staff for training with the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Division]], and then chief of artillery training on the staff at the [[American Expeditionary Forces]] headquarters.  His outstanding performance resulted in his promotion to temporary [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]]; at age 35, he was the Army's youngest general officer.\n\nMcNair's experience of more than 30 years with equipment and weapons design and testing, his administrative skills, and his success in the areas of military education and training led to his World War II assignment as commander of [[Army Ground Forces]].  In this position, McNair became the \"unsung architect of the U.S. Army\",{{sfn|\"Product page: General Lesley J. McNair: Unsung Architect of the U. S. Army\"}} and played a leading role in the organizational design, equipping, and training of Army units in the United States before they departed for overseas combat. While historians continue to debate some of McNair's decisions and actions, including the individual replacement system for killed and wounded soldiers, and a controversy over the use of tanks or tank destroyers for anti-armor combat, his concentration on advanced officer education, innovative weapons systems, improved doctrine, realistic combat training, and development of combined arms tactics enabled the Army to modernize and perform successfully on the World War II battlefield, where the mobility of mechanized forces replaced the static defenses of World War I as the primary tactical consideration.\n\nHe was killed by [[friendly fire]] while in France to act as commander of the fictitious [[First United States Army Group]], part of the [[Operation Quicksilver (deception plan)|Operation Quicksilver]] deception that masked the actual landing sites for the [[Invasion of Normandy]].  During [[Operation Cobra]], an [[Eighth Air Force]] bomb landed in his foxhole during combat near [[Saint-L\u00f4]] when the Army attempted to use heavy bombers for close air support of infantry operations as part of the [[Operation Overlord|Battle of Normandy]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Lesley J.

Lee]], an early proponent of airborne forces, had convinced McNair of the need for division-sized airborne organizations.{{sfn|''Dictionary of North Carolina Biography''|pages=45\u201346}}  Though McNair and a few other Army leaders sometimes advocated for creation of all-purpose light divisions that could be adapted for unique missions,{{sfn|''Bunker Hill to Bastogne''|page=218}} the Army did create some specialized divisions, including airborne.{{sfn|''Dictionary of North Carolina Biography''|pages=45\u201346}}  This initiative included activating the [[United States Army Airborne School|Airborne Command]] to oversee the organization and training of airborne units, conversion of the [[82nd Airborne Division|82nd]] and [[101st Airborne Division|101st]] Infantry Divisions to airborne, and preparation of these divisions for paratrooper and glider missions in Europe.{{sfn|''Dictionary of North Carolina Biography''|pages=45\u201346}}\n\nAnother initiative McNair incorporated into the effort to field the Army's World War II division was the creation of light divisions.{{sfn|''World War II in Europe''|page=646}}  Recognizing that the rugged terrain of the Italian mountains and [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific jungles]] required specialized units, the AGF reorganized three existing divisions as the [[89th Infantry Division (United States)|89th Light Division (Truck)]], [[10th Mountain Division|10th Light Division (Pack, Alpine)]], and [[71st Infantry Division (United States)|71st Light Division (Pack, Jungle)]].{{sfn|''World War II in Europe''|page=646}}  The results of pre-deployment training demonstrated that the 71st and 89th Divisions were too small to sustain themselves in combat, so they were converted back to regular infantry divisions.{{sfn|''World War II in Europe''|page=646}}  The 10th Division's early training results were also less than encouraging, but its identity as a mountain division was retained, and after completing training it served in [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|combat in the Italian mountains]].{{sfn|''World War II in Europe''|page=646}}\n\nOverall, the Army's wartime division organization and reorganizations have been judged a success by historians, in that they provided an adequate number of units to win the war, while ensuring that agricultural and industrial production could continue.{{sfn|''The Library of Congress World War II Companion''|pages=303\u2013304}}\n\n=====Individual replacement system=====\nAs AGF commander, McNair worked to solve the problem of how to integrate replacement soldiers into units that had sustained casualties.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|pages=344\u2013356}}  Rather than adopt the model of replacing units that had sustained high casualties with new, full strength units, Marshall and McNair cited the need to allocate space on transport ships to equipment and supplies as the reason to provide individual replacement soldiers to units while the units remained in combat.{{sfn|\"The U.S. World War II Troop Replacement Policy\"}}  In practice, the individual replacement system caused difficulties for both the replacement soldiers and the units they joined, especially during later stages of the war.{{sfn|\"The U.S. World War II Troop Replacement Policy\"}}  New soldiers could have difficulty being accepted by the veterans of their units, since they were replacing buddies who had been killed or wounded, and had not shared the veterans' combat experiences.{{sfn|\"The U.S. World War II Troop Replacement Policy\"}} In addition, because new soldiers joined units that were already in the fight, there was often no time to teach them the tactics and techniques that increased their chances of surviving on the battlefield.{{sfn|\"The U.S. World War II Troop Replacement Policy\"}}\n\nThough soldiers were supposed to be allocated to requesting units from replacement depots based on their qualifications and the priority of the unit, McNair found that in practice many commanders in the combat theaters used replacement soldiers to form new units, or personally selected individual replacements from personnel centers without regard to their qualifications.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|pages=344\u2013356}} Assigning soldiers to units for which they were not qualified, such as armor crewmen to infantry units, negated the training they had received before going overseas.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|pages=344\u2013356}}  To address these concerns, McNair advocated faster qualification of replacement soldiers by reducing their training from 24 weeks to 13.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|page=356}}  The War Department reduced the training requirement to 17 weeks, but mandated continued use of the individual replacement system.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J.

The AGF established WWII personnel replacement centers at Fort Ord and Fort Meade, Maryland.]]\nBecause the AGF had responsibility for implementing the individual replacement system, McNair attempted improvements, including directing the establishment of the Classification and Replacement Division within his command, and streamlining the physical, psychological, and mental criteria used to determine fitness for service.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|pages=356\u2013357}} Issues with the ASF's management of replacement centers within the United States led AGF to establish two new ones at [[Fort Meade, Maryland]], and [[Fort Ord]], [[California]].{{sfn|\"General Lesley J.

McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|pages=358\u2013360}}  In addition, he undertook several initiatives to improve the morale and ''esprit de corps'' of infantry soldiers, and enhance the goodwill of the civilian population towards the infantry, including creation of the [[Expert Infantryman Badge]], and implementation of the \"Soldier for a Day Initiative\", which gave civilian government and business leaders the opportunity to interact with mobilized soldiers before they left the United States for combat assignments.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|pages=361\u2013362}}\n\nThese initiatives were not always successful; by late 1944 and early 1945, the number of units fighting continuously or nearly continuously caused the replacement system to break down.{{sfn|\"The U.S. World War II Troop Replacement Policy\"}}  As a result, rear echelon soldiers were often pulled from their duties to fill vacancies in front line combat units, and training for some replacement soldiers and units was cut short so they could be rushed into combat.{{sfn|\"The U.S. World War II Troop Replacement Policy\"}}  Some units were worn down to the point of combat ineffectiveness.{{sfn|\"The U.S. World War II Troop Replacement Policy\"}}  In others, low morale, fatigue, and sickness became more prevalent.{{sfn|\"The U.S. World War II Troop Replacement Policy\"}}\n\n=====Recruitment efforts=====\n[[File:Lesley J.

Similar stories appeared in newspapers nationwide from mid to late November.]]\nBecause of the difficulty in attracting to the AGF those trainees deemed to be \"high-quality\", McNair attempted to recruit through improved public relations.{{sfn|''The Procurement and Training of Ground Combat Troops''|page=60}}  One part of this effort was the creation of an office attached to the AGF staff, the Special Information Section (SIS).{{sfn|''The Procurement and Training of Ground Combat Troops''|page=60}}  Approximately 12 officers and enlisted soldiers with experience as writers and editors worked in the SIS to promote improved public appreciation for AGF soldiers, especially the infantry.{{sfn|''The Procurement and Training of Ground Combat Troops''|page=60}}  In addition, the SIS worked with civilian writers and editors, musicians, cartoonists, film makers, and artists who worked in other mediums to enhance the prominence of infantrymen in their work.{{sfn|''The Procurement and Training of Ground Combat Troops''|page=60}}  As part of this initiative, McNair wrote personally to several leading magazine and newspaper publishers to ask for their aid.{{sfn|''The Procurement and Training of Ground Combat Troops''|page=60}}\n\nIn another effort to inform the public of the Army's personnel needs and improve the way the AGF was perceived, on [[Armistice Day]] in November 1942, McNair delivered a radio address over the [[Blue Network]].{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|pages=347\u2013349}}  In his remarks, titled \"The Struggle is for Survival\", McNair described the fighting capability and ruthless attitude of soldiers in the [[Imperial Japanese Army#World War II|Japanese]] and [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German]] armies, and stated that only similar qualities in American ground troops \u2013 by implication, meaning not \"the more genteel forms of warfare\" practiced by the AAF and ASF \u2013 would see the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] through to victory.{{sfn|''The Procurement and Training of Ground Combat Troops''|page=19}}  The public response to McNair's remarks was largely favorable, though he did receive some criticism for extreme language that seemed to suggest an unfeeling attitude towards death and destruction.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|pages=347\u2013349}}  More importantly, McNair's radio address did little to improve recruiting into the Army Ground Forces; the public may have developed a better appreciation for infantry, armor, and artillery, but volunteers and draftees continued to be attracted to the AAF and ASF, and the AAF and ASF continued to lobby for the bulk of new service members in the high quality category to be assigned to them.{{sfn|''The Procurement and Training of Ground Combat Troops''|page=19}}{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|pages=350}}\n\n=====African-American soldiers=====\nDuring World War II, War Department regulations for [[African Americans]] required that they be admitted into the Army in numbers proportionate to their share of the population.{{sfn|''The Training of Negro Troops''|page=iii}}  In addition, the Army was required to establish segregated African American units in each major branch of the service, and give qualified African Americans the opportunity to earn officer commissions.{{sfn|''The Training of Negro Troops''|page=iii}}  The AGF worked to reconcile these requirements with its mission of producing trained soldiers and units that were capable of meeting and defeating the enemy in battle.{{sfn|''The Training of Negro Troops''|page=iii}}  To that end, the AGF activated and trained African American units in all major branches of the ground forces, and black soldiers who graduated from [[Officer Candidate School (United States Army)|officer candidate schools]] (OCS) were assigned to African American units as they received their commissions.{{sfn|''The Training of Negro Troops''|page=iii}}  At the peak of the Army's expansion in June 1943, there were nearly 170,000 African Americans training at AGF facilities, or about 10.5 percent of its personnel strength.{{sfn|''The Training of Negro Troops''|page=iii}}  These figures were in line with the War Department requirements; at the time, African Americans accounted for between 10 and 11 percent of the U.S. population.{{sfn|''The Training of Negro Troops''|page=iii}}\n\n[[File:Coburg1945.jpg|alt=Tank and crew of 761st Tank Battalion|left|thumb|Tank and crew of the 761st Tank Battalion, an African American armor unit organized and trained by the AGF]]\nBeginning with a small number of African American units in the Regular Army and National Guard, the AGF organized and trained many more, including the African-American [[92nd Infantry Division (United States)|92nd]] and [[93rd Infantry Division (United States)|93rd]] Infantry Divisions, and the [[2nd Cavalry Division (United States)|2nd Cavalry Division]].{{sfn|''The Training of Negro Troops''|pages=5\u20136}}  By 1943, the AGF had created nearly 300 African American units,{{sfn|''The Training of Negro Troops''|page=3}} including the [[452nd Anti-Aircraft Artillery Battalion (United States)|452nd Anti-Aircraft Artillery Battalion]], the [[555th Parachute Infantry Battalion (United States)|555th Parachute Infantry Battalion]], and the [[761st Tank Battalion (United States)|761st Tank Battalion]].{{sfn|''The Training of Negro Troops''|pages=6\u20138}}\n\nThe War Department General Staff initially suggested incorporating African Americans into units with white soldiers at a ratio of 1 black to 10.6 whites.{{sfn|''The Training of Negro Troops''|page=3}}  Based on difficulties with completing training, in large part because the abilities of the recruits were lagging as a result of having grown up in the segregated education system and culture then prevalent in the United States,{{sfn|''The Training of Negro Troops''|page=iii}} McNair advocated for separate battalions of African American soldiers, arguing that they could be more effectively employed in this manner.{{sfn|''The Training of Negro Troops''|page=3}}  In McNair's construct, such units could be deployed for functions including guarding lines of communication in rear areas and near front lines, or maintained as a reserve by division and corps commanders and committed where they were most needed during combat.{{sfn|''The Training of Negro Troops''|page=3}}  The proposal that was adopted was closer to what McNair had advocated, and the AGF lengthened the initial training period.{{sfn|''The Training of Negro Troops''|page=iii}} African American officers generally filled company grade positions as they completed OCS, with white officers holding the field grade and senior command positions.{{sfn|''The Training of Negro Troops''|page=4}}  In cases where there were not enough African Americans, white officers filled the company grade positions as well.{{sfn|''The Training of Negro Troops''|page=4}}\n\n====Anti-tank weapons and doctrine====\n[[File:M-3 Antitank Gun 37mm Towed.jpg|alt=M3 towed anti-tank gun|thumb|right|M3 towed anti-tank gun, the Army's primary anti-armor weapon of the late 1930s and early 1940s]]\nDeveloping and employing anti-tank weapons and creating suitable doctrine proved to be an ongoing challenge, for which some historians have faulted McNair.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|page=364}}  Marshall favored creation of self-propelled anti-tank weapons; McNair had long favored towed weapons, including the [[37 mm Gun M3|M3]] gun.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|page=365}}{{sfn|''The Organization of Ground Combat Troops''|page=427}}  McNair recognized the limitations of the anti-tank weapons then available, and favored a defensive approach for their use, advocating that units emplace and camouflage them, but official doctrine called for a more offensive mindset.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|page=365}} It also called for anti-tank units to conduct independent operations; McNair favored a combined arms approach.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|pages=365\u2013366}}  He believed the use of anti-tank weapons was an economical and efficient means to defeat enemy tanks, and would free up U.S. tanks for wider offensive operations.{{sfn|''Mobility, Shock, and Firepower''|pages=315\u2013316}}\n\nWhen the M3 anti-tank gun proved to be a less than optimum anti-tank weapon, the Army began development of [[tank destroyer]]s \u2013 self-propelled tracked vehicles with a gun capable of engaging a tank, but which were faster and more maneuverable because they had thinner armor than a tank.  When it appeared that the Infantry and Cavalry branch chiefs might subsume proposed tank destroyer units into their own task organizations, Marshall attempted to continue progress on tank destroyer development without generating active dissent by approving creation of the Tank Destroyer Center at [[Fort Hood|Camp Hood]].{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|pages=365\u2013366}}  In practice, the separate Tank Destroyer Center meant that commanders of armor and infantry units had little or no experience with anti-tank weapons, or the most effective way to employ them.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J.

McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|pages=365\u2013366}}  As a result of the Army's inability to resolve the questions of equipment and doctrine, it continued to struggle with efforts to develop viable anti-tank doctrine, and efforts to employ anti-tank guns or tank destroyers as part of combined arms team often proved ineffective.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|pages=365\u2013366}}\n\nThe ongoing debate within the Army about which type of anti-tank or tank destroyer weapon to use, and what design specifications ought to be included, also hampered the AGF's abilities to field the weapons and provide adequate training.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|pages=366\u2013367}}  As a result, during their initial employment and use, AGF observers in combat theaters identified several issues, including some as basic as training ammunition for the M3 Gun Motor Carriage being used unknowingly during combat, which obviously limited its effectiveness.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|page=367}}  Over time, commanders in combat resorted to field expedient measures to solve the problems, including learning to employ anti-tank guns and later tank destroyers in mutually supporting positions, and integrating them with infantry and armor units to maximize their effectiveness as part of a combined arms effort.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|pages=366\u2013368}}  The AGF in turn incorporated these lessons learned into mobilization training, so that over time soldiers and units deploying for combat were making use of the most up to date doctrine and tactics.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J.

McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|pages=78, 110, 113, 207, 228\u2013230}}  The condition progressed, and included [[tinnitus]], but did not interfere with his work; physical examinations indicated he had no trouble with tasks including speaking on the telephone.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|pages=78, 110, 113, 207, 228\u2013230}}  By the time he reached the ranks of the Army's senior commanders, his hearing loss was severe enough that he compensated by [[Lip reading|reading lips]], and by forgoing participation in events where his difficulty in hearing would pose an obstacle, such as large conferences.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|page=277}} By the late 1930s, he worried that his hearing condition might result in his mandatory retirement for medical reasons.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|pages=229\u2013230}}  Instead, Marshall issued a waiver which allowed him to continue to serve.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|pages=229\u2013230}} His hearing loss may have prevented him from obtaining a field command during World War II, but Marshall was unwilling to do without his abilities as an organizer and trainer.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J.

McNair main gate sign|thumb|left|Sign near main gate to Fort McNair, the former Washington Barracks]]\nMcNair was held in high regard by his contemporaries, as evidenced by performance appraisals that routinely gave him the highest possible ratings.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|pages=174, 228, 263}} Marshall also held McNair in high esteem,{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|pages=240\u2013241}} as demonstrated by the fact that McNair was a top stateside commander during World War II, was considered for a top command in Europe, and was ultimately selected to command the First United States Army Group as part of a deception plan that required a general with a good reputation and high name recognition for successful execution.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|page=387}}  In addition, soon after McNair was assigned to serve as commandant of the Command and General Staff School, Marshall learned that he would become the Chief of Staff of the Army.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|pages=240\u2013241}}  In a letter to McNair, Marshall wrote: \"You at the head of Leavenworth are one of the great satisfactions I have at the moment in visualizing the responsibilities of the next couple of years.\"{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|pages=240\u2013241}} [[Mark W. Clark]] served under McNair as operations officer (G-3) at AGF Headquarters before ascending to the general officer ranks.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|pages=276\u2013277}}  In his autobiography, Clark referred to McNair as \"one of the most brilliant, selfless and devoted soldiers\" he had ever encountered.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|pages=276\u2013277}}\n\nMcNair's primary legacy was his role as \"the brains of the Army\", in that his involvement in unit design (the triangular division), education (the Command and General Staff Officer Course), doctrine (updating the ''Field Service Manual'' and revising field artillery methods and procedures), weapons design and procurement (experimentation with field artillery, anti-tank weapons, and anti-aircraft weapons), and training of soldiers and units (as commander of Army Ground Forces), especially in the era between World Wars I and II, made him one of the primary architects of the Army as the United States employed it for World War II.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J.

McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|page=308}}  These concepts remain the Army's core principles for planning, executing, and overseeing individual and collective training.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|page=308}}\n\n===Historical debate===\nMcNair's decisions and actions during World War II continue to be debated by historians, particularly the individual replacement system and the difficulties with resolving the issue of tanks versus anti-tank guns and tank destroyers.{{sfn|\"The U.S. World War II Troop Replacement Policy\"}}\n\nWith respect to the individual replacement program, historian [[Stephen Ambrose]] described it as inefficient, wasteful, and a contributor to unnecessary casualties.{{sfn|\"The U.S. World War II Troop Replacement Policy\"}}  However, some recent assessments have viewed it more favorably.{{sfn|\"A few words in favor of the much-derided individual replacement system for soldiers\"}}  As one example, a 2013 essay by Robert S. Rush concluded \"Success results NOT from rotating organizations in and out of combat but from sustaining those organizations while in combat.\"{{sfn|\"A few words in favor of the much-derided individual replacement system for soldiers\"}}\n\nOn the questions of fielding anti-tank guns and tank destroyers as the primary anti-armor weapons, and fielding light and medium tanks instead of a heavy tank capable of matching those in German armor units, historians including Mark Calhoun argue that McNair recognized the limitations of the anti-tank weapons then available, and the difficulties with providing better ones given time and production constraints, and so worked to develop a doctrine that made the best possible use of the weapons that were available.{{sfn|\"Leadership and Operational Art in World War II: The Case for General Lesley J. McNair\"}}  Other historians, including Steve Zaloga, argue that McNair's opposition to development and fielding of heavy tanks represented a \"World War I mindset\" that hindered the overall performance of the US Army during World War II.{{sfn|''Armored Thunderbolt: The U.S. Army Sherman in World War II''|page=124}}\n\n===Awards and honors===\n[[File:McNair Hall, Headquarters of Fort Sill, Oklahoma April 5, 2017.JPG|alt=McNair Hall, Ft.

He attained the rank of [[Lieutenant general (United States)|lieutenant general]] during his life; he was killed in action during World War II, and received a posthumous promotion to [[General (United States)|general]].\n\nA [[Minnesota]] native and 1904 graduate of the [[United States Military Academy]], McNair was a [[Field Artillery Branch (United States)|Field Artillery]] officer with a background in the [[Ordnance Corps (United States Army)|Ordnance Department]].  A veteran of the [[United States occupation of Veracruz|Veracruz occupation]] and [[Pancho Villa Expedition]], during World War I he served as assistant chief of staff for training with the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Division]], and then chief of artillery training on the staff at the [[American Expeditionary Forces]] headquarters.  His outstanding performance resulted in his promotion to temporary [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]]; at age 35, he was the Army's youngest general officer.\n\nMcNair's experience of more than 30 years with equipment and weapons design and testing, his administrative skills, and his success in the areas of military education and training led to his World War II assignment as commander of [[Army Ground Forces]].  In this position, McNair became the \"unsung architect of the U.S. Army\",{{sfn|\"Product page: General Lesley J. McNair: Unsung Architect of the U. S. Army\"}} and played a leading role in the organizational design, equipping, and training of Army units in the United States before they departed for overseas combat. While historians continue to debate some of McNair's decisions and actions, including the individual replacement system for killed and wounded soldiers, and a controversy over the use of tanks or tank destroyers for anti-armor combat, his concentration on advanced officer education, innovative weapons systems, improved doctrine, realistic combat training, and development of combined arms tactics enabled the Army to modernize and perform successfully on the World War II battlefield, where the mobility of mechanized forces replaced the static defenses of World War I as the primary tactical consideration.\n\nHe was killed by [[friendly fire]] while in France to act as commander of the fictitious [[First United States Army Group]], part of the [[Operation Quicksilver (deception plan)|Operation Quicksilver]] deception that masked the actual landing sites for the [[Invasion of Normandy]].  During [[Operation Cobra]], an [[Eighth Air Force]] bomb landed in his foxhole during combat near [[Saint-L\u00f4]] when the Army attempted to use heavy bombers for close air support of infantry operations as part of the [[Operation Overlord|Battle of Normandy]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Lesley J.

McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|page=16}}  After approval of his transfer request, he was first assigned to [[Sandy Hook Proving Ground]], [[New Jersey]], where he began a lifelong interest in testing and experimenting with new equipment and weapons.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|page=16}}  Initially, McNair's Ordnance testing centered on improving the [[mountain guns]] used by units including his 12th Battery for artillery support of troops in rugged terrain where [[limbers and caissons]] could not travel.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|page=16}}\n\nAfter assignment to the staff of the Army's [[Ordnance Corps (United States Army)#Chiefs of Ordnance|Chief of Ordnance]] from 1905 to 1906, McNair was assigned to the [[Watertown Arsenal]], where he completed self-directed academic studies in metallurgy and other scientific topics.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|pages=17\u201319}}  In this posting, he gained experience with both laboratory and practical methods of experimentation, including analyzing bronze, steel, and cast iron to determine the best materials to use in manufacturing [[cannon]]s and other weapons.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|pages=17\u201319}}  In addition, he gained firsthand experience with the uses and applications of several foundry machines, including [[forge]]s, [[steam hammer]]s, [[lathe]]s, [[Planer (metalworking)|planing machines]], and [[Boring (manufacturing)|boring machines]].{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|pages=17\u201319}}  His business college background in statistical analysis and engineering (including technical drawing) helped make him successful at testing and experimentation; as a result of his experience at Watertown, for the rest of his career the Army frequently relied on him to oversee boards that developed and tested weapons and other equipment, and made recommendations on which items were most suitable for procurement and fielding.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|pages=17\u201319}} He was promoted to temporary [[First lieutenant#U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Air Force|first lieutenant]] in July 1905,{{sfn|''Biographical Register''|page=1077}} and permanent first lieutenant in January 1907.{{sfn|''Biographical Register''|page=1077}}  In May 1907, McNair was promoted to temporary [[Captain (United States O-3)|captain]].{{sfn|''Biographical Register''|page=1077}}{{sfn|\"General Lesley J.

McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|page=30}}  Instructors at the school had spent more than a year gathering information on 7,000 rounds fired during tests and field exercises; because the school was short-staffed, the commandant called on McNair to compile the data into [[Table (information)|firing tables]] that would make it easier for Artillery crews Army-wide to plan and control [[indirect fire]].{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|page=30}}  While carrying out this assignment in 1913, he also spent seven months in France to observe and gather information on the French Army's artillery training, education, and employment.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J.

McNair routinely received the highest possible ratings on his performance appraisals.]]\nThe Chief of Staff of the Army, General [[Malin Craig]], selected McNair to command the Command and General Staff College because he believed its teaching methods needed to be updated, and that the combat unit planning and reporting processes it taught needed to be streamlined. Craig felt that McNair's background made him ideally suited to lead this effort;{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|page=238}} in addition, Craig's deputy, Brigadier General [[George Marshall]], believed that the Command and General Staff College program of instruction was too rigid and too focused on a staff process geared towards leadership of Regular Army units.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|pages=238\u2013242}}  In Marshall's view, the curriculum needed to be overhauled to reflect the likely needs of the World War II army, including faster, more flexible methods for planning and execution of large scale mobilizations, and incorporation of processes for training draftees and members of the National Guard, who would report for duty with less training and experience than members of the Regular Army.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|pages=238\u2013242}}  In addition, Marshall wanted to ensure that graduates were prepared to plan and execute the offensive maneuver-based operations Army leaders anticipated would characterize World War II, as opposed to the defensive trench warfare of World War I.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|pages=238\u2013242}}\n\nIn addition to modernizing the curriculum, McNair reduced the course length to accommodate the civilian schedules of National Guard and Reserve officers, many of whom would otherwise be unable to attend.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|pages=256\u2013257}} While working to update and streamline the curriculum, McNair updated the Army's core doctrine, the ''Field Service Manual''.  He began his service as commandant in time to finalize publication of the 1939 edition, which was divided into three Field Manuals (FMs): FM 100-5, ''Operations''; FM 100-10,\n''Administration''; and FM 100-15, ''Large Units''.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J.

By the time of his second appraisal as commandant, the War Department had waived the requirement for written evaluations of officers supervised directly by the Army Chief of Staff, but in his second role as commander of Fort Leavenworth, Bishop rated McNair as superior in all areas, recommended him for a high level command in combat, and ranked him first of the more than 30 brigadier generals Bishop knew.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J.

McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|pages=317\u2013324}}  Additionally, competition for authority and resources also emerged between the War Department General Staff and the three functional commands, and between the functional commands themselves.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|pages=317\u2013324}}  Used to working with minimal delegation, and functioning with a small staff, McNair largely concentrated on the task at hand, and avoided the rivalries as much as possible.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J.

Lee]], an early proponent of airborne forces, had convinced McNair of the need for division-sized airborne organizations.{{sfn|''Dictionary of North Carolina Biography''|pages=45\u201346}}  Though McNair and a few other Army leaders sometimes advocated for creation of all-purpose light divisions that could be adapted for unique missions,{{sfn|''Bunker Hill to Bastogne''|page=218}} the Army did create some specialized divisions, including airborne.{{sfn|''Dictionary of North Carolina Biography''|pages=45\u201346}}  This initiative included activating the [[United States Army Airborne School|Airborne Command]] to oversee the organization and training of airborne units, conversion of the [[82nd Airborne Division|82nd]] and [[101st Airborne Division|101st]] Infantry Divisions to airborne, and preparation of these divisions for paratrooper and glider missions in Europe.{{sfn|''Dictionary of North Carolina Biography''|pages=45\u201346}}\n\nAnother initiative McNair incorporated into the effort to field the Army's World War II division was the creation of light divisions.{{sfn|''World War II in Europe''|page=646}}  Recognizing that the rugged terrain of the Italian mountains and [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific jungles]] required specialized units, the AGF reorganized three existing divisions as the [[89th Infantry Division (United States)|89th Light Division (Truck)]], [[10th Mountain Division|10th Light Division (Pack, Alpine)]], and [[71st Infantry Division (United States)|71st Light Division (Pack, Jungle)]].{{sfn|''World War II in Europe''|page=646}}  The results of pre-deployment training demonstrated that the 71st and 89th Divisions were too small to sustain themselves in combat, so they were converted back to regular infantry divisions.{{sfn|''World War II in Europe''|page=646}}  The 10th Division's early training results were also less than encouraging, but its identity as a mountain division was retained, and after completing training it served in [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|combat in the Italian mountains]].{{sfn|''World War II in Europe''|page=646}}\n\nOverall, the Army's wartime division organization and reorganizations have been judged a success by historians, in that they provided an adequate number of units to win the war, while ensuring that agricultural and industrial production could continue.{{sfn|''The Library of Congress World War II Companion''|pages=303\u2013304}}\n\n=====Individual replacement system=====\nAs AGF commander, McNair worked to solve the problem of how to integrate replacement soldiers into units that had sustained casualties.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|pages=344\u2013356}}  Rather than adopt the model of replacing units that had sustained high casualties with new, full strength units, Marshall and McNair cited the need to allocate space on transport ships to equipment and supplies as the reason to provide individual replacement soldiers to units while the units remained in combat.{{sfn|\"The U.S. World War II Troop Replacement Policy\"}}  In practice, the individual replacement system caused difficulties for both the replacement soldiers and the units they joined, especially during later stages of the war.{{sfn|\"The U.S. World War II Troop Replacement Policy\"}}  New soldiers could have difficulty being accepted by the veterans of their units, since they were replacing buddies who had been killed or wounded, and had not shared the veterans' combat experiences.{{sfn|\"The U.S. World War II Troop Replacement Policy\"}} In addition, because new soldiers joined units that were already in the fight, there was often no time to teach them the tactics and techniques that increased their chances of surviving on the battlefield.{{sfn|\"The U.S. World War II Troop Replacement Policy\"}}\n\nThough soldiers were supposed to be allocated to requesting units from replacement depots based on their qualifications and the priority of the unit, McNair found that in practice many commanders in the combat theaters used replacement soldiers to form new units, or personally selected individual replacements from personnel centers without regard to their qualifications.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|pages=344\u2013356}} Assigning soldiers to units for which they were not qualified, such as armor crewmen to infantry units, negated the training they had received before going overseas.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|pages=344\u2013356}}  To address these concerns, McNair advocated faster qualification of replacement soldiers by reducing their training from 24 weeks to 13.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|page=356}}  The War Department reduced the training requirement to 17 weeks, but mandated continued use of the individual replacement system.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J.

The AGF established WWII personnel replacement centers at Fort Ord and Fort Meade, Maryland.]]\nBecause the AGF had responsibility for implementing the individual replacement system, McNair attempted improvements, including directing the establishment of the Classification and Replacement Division within his command, and streamlining the physical, psychological, and mental criteria used to determine fitness for service.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|pages=356\u2013357}} Issues with the ASF's management of replacement centers within the United States led AGF to establish two new ones at [[Fort Meade, Maryland]], and [[Fort Ord]], [[California]].{{sfn|\"General Lesley J.

McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|pages=358\u2013360}}  In addition, he undertook several initiatives to improve the morale and ''esprit de corps'' of infantry soldiers, and enhance the goodwill of the civilian population towards the infantry, including creation of the [[Expert Infantryman Badge]], and implementation of the \"Soldier for a Day Initiative\", which gave civilian government and business leaders the opportunity to interact with mobilized soldiers before they left the United States for combat assignments.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|pages=361\u2013362}}\n\nThese initiatives were not always successful; by late 1944 and early 1945, the number of units fighting continuously or nearly continuously caused the replacement system to break down.{{sfn|\"The U.S. World War II Troop Replacement Policy\"}}  As a result, rear echelon soldiers were often pulled from their duties to fill vacancies in front line combat units, and training for some replacement soldiers and units was cut short so they could be rushed into combat.{{sfn|\"The U.S. World War II Troop Replacement Policy\"}}  Some units were worn down to the point of combat ineffectiveness.{{sfn|\"The U.S. World War II Troop Replacement Policy\"}}  In others, low morale, fatigue, and sickness became more prevalent.{{sfn|\"The U.S. World War II Troop Replacement Policy\"}}\n\n=====Recruitment efforts=====\n[[File:Lesley J.

McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|page=364}}  Marshall favored creation of self-propelled anti-tank weapons; McNair had long favored towed weapons, including the [[37 mm Gun M3|M3]] gun.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|page=365}}{{sfn|''The Organization of Ground Combat Troops''|page=427}}  McNair recognized the limitations of the anti-tank weapons then available, and favored a defensive approach for their use, advocating that units emplace and camouflage them, but official doctrine called for a more offensive mindset.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|page=365}} It also called for anti-tank units to conduct independent operations; McNair favored a combined arms approach.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J.

When it appeared that the Infantry and Cavalry branch chiefs might subsume proposed tank destroyer units into their own task organizations, Marshall attempted to continue progress on tank destroyer development without generating active dissent by approving creation of the Tank Destroyer Center at [[Fort Hood|Camp Hood]].{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|pages=365\u2013366}}  In practice, the separate Tank Destroyer Center meant that commanders of armor and infantry units had little or no experience with anti-tank weapons, or the most effective way to employ them.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J.

McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|pages=365\u2013366}}  As a result of the Army's inability to resolve the questions of equipment and doctrine, it continued to struggle with efforts to develop viable anti-tank doctrine, and efforts to employ anti-tank guns or tank destroyers as part of combined arms team often proved ineffective.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|pages=365\u2013366}}\n\nThe ongoing debate within the Army about which type of anti-tank or tank destroyer weapon to use, and what design specifications ought to be included, also hampered the AGF's abilities to field the weapons and provide adequate training.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|pages=366\u2013367}}  As a result, during their initial employment and use, AGF observers in combat theaters identified several issues, including some as basic as training ammunition for the M3 Gun Motor Carriage being used unknowingly during combat, which obviously limited its effectiveness.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|page=367}}  Over time, commanders in combat resorted to field expedient measures to solve the problems, including learning to employ anti-tank guns and later tank destroyers in mutually supporting positions, and integrating them with infantry and armor units to maximize their effectiveness as part of a combined arms effort.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J. McNair: Little-Known Architect of the U.S. Army\"|pages=366\u2013368}}  The AGF in turn incorporated these lessons learned into mobilization training, so that over time soldiers and units deploying for combat were making use of the most up to date doctrine and tactics.{{sfn|\"General Lesley J.

[[Max Gerson]] proposed that coffee enemas had a positive effect on the [[gastro-intestinal tract]]. Gerson said that coffee enemas had positive detoxification effects that contributed to the recovering health of his patients. He claimed that unlike [[saline (medicine)|saline]] enemas, coffee in the enema traveled through the [[smooth muscle]] of the [[small intestine]], and into the [[liver]]. This, he said, stimulated the [[autonomic nervous system]] in the same way caffeine does when consumed orally and activated the release of bile in the liver, cleared even more of the gastro-intestinal tract and removed more toxins than a normal enema. He told his patients often that the \"coffee enemas are not given for the function of the intestines but for the stimulation of the liver.\"<ref name=cancer />\n\nCoffee enemas appeared in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] manual in 1944 as a stimulating enema for the treatment of shock and poisoning, mixed with brandy.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gunter|first1=Jen|title=Did the military use coffee enemas?

[[Max Gerson]] proposed that coffee enemas had a positive effect on the [[gastro-intestinal tract]]. Gerson said that coffee enemas had positive detoxification effects that contributed to the recovering health of his patients. He claimed that unlike [[saline (medicine)|saline]] enemas, coffee in the enema traveled through the [[smooth muscle]] of the [[small intestine]], and into the [[liver]]. This, he said, stimulated the [[autonomic nervous system]] in the same way caffeine does when consumed orally and activated the release of bile in the liver, cleared even more of the gastro-intestinal tract and removed more toxins than a normal enema. He told his patients often that the \"coffee enemas are not given for the function of the intestines but for the stimulation of the liver.\"<ref name=cancer />\n\nCoffee enemas appeared in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] manual in 1944 as a stimulating enema for the treatment of shock and poisoning, mixed with brandy.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gunter|first1=Jen|title=Did the military use coffee enemas?

It was released on November 6, 2013, by Streamline and [[Interscope Records]]. Gaga began planning the project in 2011, shortly after the launch of her second effort, ''[[Born This Way (album)|Born This Way]]''. Work continued until 2013 while the singer was traveling for her [[Born This Way Ball]] concert tour and recovering from surgery for an injury she had sustained while touring. Gaga described ''Artpop'' as \"a celebration and a poetic musical journey\" and an exploration of the \"reverse [[Warholian]]\" phenomenon in [[Popular culture|pop culture]]. It displays an intentional \"lack of maturity and responsibility\" by comparison to the darker and anthemic nature of ''Born This Way''. Gaga collaborated with various producers on the record, including [[DJ White Shadow]], [[RedOne]], [[Zedd (musician)|Zedd]] and [[Madeon]]. Lyrically, ''Artpop'' revolves around Gaga's personal views of fame, sex and self-empowerment; references include [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]]. It also features guest vocals from [[T.I.]], [[Too Short]], [[Twista]], and [[R. Kelly]]. Kelly's featured song, \"[[Do What U Want]]\", was removed from all streaming and online versions of the album in January 2019, and was removed from new vinyl and CD pressings of the album in November 2019, as a reaction to the documentary ''[[Surviving R. Kelly]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Cirisano|first=Tatiana|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8533062/lady-gaga-artpop-without-r-kelly-do-what-u-want|title=Lady Gaga Lists New 'ARTPOP' Version Without R.

While the album received generally mixed reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], it was commercially successful, debuting at number one on the United States' [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart with first-week sales of 258,000 copies, becoming Gaga's second consecutive number one record in the country. It also topped national [[record chart]]s in five additional countries and charted within the top ten in over 20. According to the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] (IFPI), ''Artpop'' was the ninth global best-selling album of 2013 with 2.3 million copies worldwide.<ref name=\"IFPI 1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/downloads/Digital-Music-Report-2014.pdf|title=Global Music Report 2014|publisher=[[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]]|accessdate=June 26, 2014|page=12}}</ref> The album sold 2.5 million units as of July 2014.

The background consists of art works including ''The Birth of Venus'', which inspired the singer's music video for \"Applause\" and the VMA performance of the song. Koons explained the meaning of the cover to MTV:\n\n{{blockquote|\"With the cover, I wanted to have Gaga there as a sculpture, as a three-dimensional type of form and with the gazing ball, because the gazing ball really does become kind of the symbol for everything \u2014 and this aspect of reflection that when you come across something like a gazing ball, it affirms you, it affirms your existence and then from that affirmation, you start to want more. There's a transcendence that takes place and eventually it really leads you to everything. So that aspect's there. But I didn't want Gaga there just kind of isolated, so in the background there's [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|[Gian Lorenzo] Bernini]]'s '[[Apollo and Daphne (Bernini)|Apollo and Daphne]]' \u2014 and that's the work where [[Apollo]] chases [[Daphne]] and she turns into a tree. And so there's just glimpses of Daphne's face and of Apollo. Apollo is the god of music and whenever Apollo would perform music he would transcend, he would change; his being would become more feminine. And that's the transcendence that you can experience through art and life. Your being can change, your possibilities can change, your perimeters can change. And also in [these] triangular shapes that go out is [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]]'s ''[[The Birth of Venus]]'', presenting Gaga of course in the role of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] \u2014 of the nature of the continuation of life's energy and the pursuit and the enjoyment of aesthetics and of beauty. And of the desire to continually have transcendence.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Ehrlich|first=Brenna|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1717125/lady-gaga-artpop-album-art-jeff-koons.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga's ARTPOP Cover: Artist Jeff Koons Explains What It All Means - Music, Celebrity, Artist News|publisher=MTV News|date=November 11, 2013|accessdate=November 11, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213155629/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1717125/lady-gaga-artpop-album-art-jeff-koons.jhtml|archivedate=February 13, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>}}\n\nWill Gompertz from ''[[NME]]'' wrote that \"this is a classic cover.

It was released on November 6, 2013, by Streamline and [[Interscope Records]]. Gaga began planning the project in 2011, shortly after the launch of her second effort, ''[[Born This Way (album)|Born This Way]]''. Work continued until 2013 while the singer was traveling for her [[Born This Way Ball]] concert tour and recovering from surgery for an injury she had sustained while touring. Gaga described ''Artpop'' as \"a celebration and a poetic musical journey\" and an exploration of the \"reverse [[Warholian]]\" phenomenon in [[Popular culture|pop culture]]. It displays an intentional \"lack of maturity and responsibility\" by comparison to the darker and anthemic nature of ''Born This Way''. Gaga collaborated with various producers on the record, including [[DJ White Shadow]], [[RedOne]], [[Zedd (musician)|Zedd]] and [[Madeon]]. Lyrically, ''Artpop'' revolves around Gaga's personal views of fame, sex and self-empowerment; references include [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]]. It also features guest vocals from [[T.I.]], [[Too Short]], [[Twista]], and [[R. Kelly]]. Kelly's featured song, \"[[Do What U Want]]\", was removed from all streaming and online versions of the album in January 2019, and was removed from new vinyl and CD pressings of the album in November 2019, as a reaction to the documentary ''[[Surviving R. Kelly]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Cirisano|first=Tatiana|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8533062/lady-gaga-artpop-without-r-kelly-do-what-u-want|title=Lady Gaga Lists New 'ARTPOP' Version Without R.

While the album received generally mixed reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], it was commercially successful, debuting at number one on the United States' [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart with first-week sales of 258,000 copies, becoming Gaga's second consecutive number one record in the country. It also topped national [[record chart]]s in five additional countries and charted within the top ten in over 20. According to the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] (IFPI), ''Artpop'' was the ninth global best-selling album of 2013 with 2.3 million copies worldwide.<ref name=\"IFPI 1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/downloads/Digital-Music-Report-2014.pdf|title=Global Music Report 2014|publisher=[[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]]|accessdate=June 26, 2014|page=12}}</ref> The album sold 2.5 million units as of July 2014.

The background consists of art works including ''The Birth of Venus'', which inspired the singer's music video for \"Applause\" and the VMA performance of the song. Koons explained the meaning of the cover to MTV:\n\n{{blockquote|\"With the cover, I wanted to have Gaga there as a sculpture, as a three-dimensional type of form and with the gazing ball, because the gazing ball really does become kind of the symbol for everything \u2014 and this aspect of reflection that when you come across something like a gazing ball, it affirms you, it affirms your existence and then from that affirmation, you start to want more. There's a transcendence that takes place and eventually it really leads you to everything. So that aspect's there. But I didn't want Gaga there just kind of isolated, so in the background there's [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|[Gian Lorenzo] Bernini]]'s '[[Apollo and Daphne (Bernini)|Apollo and Daphne]]' \u2014 and that's the work where [[Apollo]] chases [[Daphne]] and she turns into a tree. And so there's just glimpses of Daphne's face and of Apollo. Apollo is the god of music and whenever Apollo would perform music he would transcend, he would change; his being would become more feminine. And that's the transcendence that you can experience through art and life. Your being can change, your possibilities can change, your perimeters can change. And also in [these] triangular shapes that go out is [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]]'s ''[[The Birth of Venus]]'', presenting Gaga of course in the role of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] \u2014 of the nature of the continuation of life's energy and the pursuit and the enjoyment of aesthetics and of beauty. And of the desire to continually have transcendence.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Ehrlich|first=Brenna|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1717125/lady-gaga-artpop-album-art-jeff-koons.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga's ARTPOP Cover: Artist Jeff Koons Explains What It All Means - Music, Celebrity, Artist News|publisher=MTV News|date=November 11, 2013|accessdate=November 11, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213155629/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1717125/lady-gaga-artpop-album-art-jeff-koons.jhtml|archivedate=February 13, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>}}\n\nWill Gompertz from ''[[NME]]'' wrote that \"this is a classic cover.

The lawsuit began a five-year battle, which cost millions of dollars, and according to an article in ''The New York Times'', left Holm and her husband with a \"fragile hold\" on their apartment, which Holm purchased for $10,000 cash in 1953 from her film earnings, and which in 2011 was believed to be worth at least $10,000,000.<ref name=\"holmandbasile\"/>\n\n==Health and death==\nAccording to Basile, Holm had been treated for memory loss since 2002, suffered skin cancer, bleeding ulcers and a collapsed lung, and had hip replacements and pacemakers.<ref name=holmandbasile/>\n\nIn June 2012, Holm was admitted to New York's [[Roosevelt Hospital]] with dehydration, where she suffered a heart attack on July 13, 2012; she died two days later at her Central Park West apartment, aged 95.<ref name=obit>{{cite news |first=Anita |last=Gates |title=Celeste Holm, Witty Character Actress, Is Dead at 95 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/16/theater/celeste-holm-witty-character-actress-dies-at-95.html |quote=Celeste Holm, the New York-born actress who made an indelible Broadway impression as an amorous country girl in Rodgers and Hammerstein's \"Oklahoma!\", earned an Academy Award as the knowing voice of tolerance in \"Gentleman's Agreement\" and went on to a six-decade screen and stage career, frequently cast as the wistful or brittle sophisticate, died early Sunday at her apartment in Manhattan.

Her father, Theodor Holm, was a Norwegian businessman whose company provided marine adjustment services for [[Lloyd's of London]].<ref name=today/> Because of her parents' occupations, she traveled often during her youth and attended various schools in the Netherlands, France and the United States. She began high school at the [[University School for Girls]] in Chicago, and then transferred to the [[Francis W.

The lawsuit began a five-year battle, which cost millions of dollars, and according to an article in ''The New York Times'', left Holm and her husband with a \"fragile hold\" on their apartment, which Holm purchased for $10,000 cash in 1953 from her film earnings, and which in 2011 was believed to be worth at least $10,000,000.<ref name=\"holmandbasile\"/>\n\n==Health and death==\nAccording to Basile, Holm had been treated for memory loss since 2002, suffered skin cancer, bleeding ulcers and a collapsed lung, and had hip replacements and pacemakers.<ref name=holmandbasile/>\n\nIn June 2012, Holm was admitted to New York's [[Roosevelt Hospital]] with dehydration, where she suffered a heart attack on July 13, 2012; she died two days later at her Central Park West apartment, aged 95.<ref name=obit>{{cite news |first=Anita |last=Gates |title=Celeste Holm, Witty Character Actress, Is Dead at 95 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/16/theater/celeste-holm-witty-character-actress-dies-at-95.html |quote=Celeste Holm, the New York-born actress who made an indelible Broadway impression as an amorous country girl in Rodgers and Hammerstein's \"Oklahoma!\", earned an Academy Award as the knowing voice of tolerance in \"Gentleman's Agreement\" and went on to a six-decade screen and stage career, frequently cast as the wistful or brittle sophisticate, died early Sunday at her apartment in Manhattan.
