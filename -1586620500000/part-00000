''Kok'' means language and ''borok'' means people (the people who speak Kokborok). Kokborok is one of the [[Tibeto-Burman languages]] widely spoken in the Northeastern part of [[India]] in the state of [[Tripura]] and neighbouring CHT hill tracts of [[Bangladesh]]. The Kokborok language is one of the fastest growing and developing Tibeto-Burman languages in the region. The language is spoken mainly by the [[Debbarma]], [[Kalai Upazila|Kalai]], [[Reang]], [[Jamatia]], [[Tripura]] , [[Noatia]], Rupini, Murasing and Uchoi people. However, the language has similarities with other Tibeto-Burman languages such as Bodo, Garo and [[Dimasa people|Dimasa]]. The communities who speak Kokborok are categorised as Tripuri communities. All the communities who speak Kokborok are known as \"Tipra/Tripuris.\"\n\nThe script of the Kokborok is not yet finalised due to many socio-political debates, but many people prefer writing it in \"[[Latin script]]\" and some people write Kokborok in [[Bengali alphabet|\"Bengali\"]] script. It has been mentioned in the chronicle of the [[Tripuri kings|Tripura Kings]] who were the Borok rulers (184 kings) of Tripura for more than two thousand years that \"Koloma\" was the script of Kokborok, but is not known anymore.\n\n\"[[Kokborok tei Hukumu Mission]]\", many government and non-government groups are continuously involved in promoting and developing Kokborok language, Art, literature, and films/songs through cultural revolution.

Their houses in these areas are built of [[bamboo]] or ''ua'' as it is called in [[Kokborok]] and raised five to six feet height to save themselves from the dangers of the wild animals. Nowadays a considerable section of this community are living in the plains and erecting houses like the plains people, adopting their methods of cultivation, and following them in other aspects of life, such as dress, manners, and cosmetics. Tripuri women wear a scarp, called ''rignai'', which reaches down just below the knee. They weave in their loin-loom a small piece of cloth, which they call it ''risa'', and they use this small piece of cloth as their breast garment.\n\n==Foods==\nBamboo shoot is a traditional food of the Tripuri people. They call it \"Muya\". Wet and dry Fish is their traditional ingredient of cooking. They Called it \"Berma and aakran\". \nThe Food list of Tripuri People are very rich which includes Mushroom, Corn, Bamboo shoots, Mosodeng, Godok,etc. Different Vegetables include yams, pumpkins, peas, cabbage and cucumbers,wax Gourd, plantain. Vegetables and fruit gathered from the forest may be added to their diet. Fish, chiken, and Pork are also eaten.\n\n==Festival==\nBwisu/Bowishu is the most important socio-religious festival of The Tripuri. This festival gave birth to the Bwisu dance. The festival lasts for three days and begins one day before the last day of the month of Chaitra, falling in the month of April.\n\n==Tripuri games and sports==\n{{Main|Tripuri games and sports}}\nLike many parts of the world the Tripuri has traditional sports.

For example, \"All swans are white\" is falsifiable because  \"Here is a black swan\" shows it to be false. Formally, it is the same, except that the observations used to prove falsifiability are only logical constructions distinct from those that are truly possible.<ref name=\"formaldefinition\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"somecontradiction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nFalsifiability differs from [[Logical_positivism|verifiability]], which was held as fundamental by many philosophers such as those of the [[Vienna Circle]]. In order to verify the claim \"All swans are white\" one would have to observe every swan, which is not possible, whereas the single observation \"Here is a black swan\" is sufficient to falsify it. \n\nIt was introduced by the [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] [[Karl Raimund Popper|Karl Popper]] in his book ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'' (1934), as an answer to both the [[Problem of Induction]] and  the [[Demarcation Problem]].  He saw falsifiability as the cornerstone of [[critical rationalism]], his theory of science.{{sfn|Popper|1989|pp=82-85}}\n\nAs a key notion in the separation of science from non-science, it has featured prominently in many scientific controversies and applications, even being used as legal precedent.\n\n==The problem of induction==\nOne of the questions in [[Scientific method]] is: how does one move from observations to laws? This is the [[problem of induction]].  Suppose we want to put the theory that all swans are white to the test. We come across a white swan. We cannot validly argue from \"here is a white swan\" to \"all swans are white\"; doing so would require a fallacious logic such as, for example, [[affirming the consequent]].<ref name=\"affirmtheconsequentVsinductivelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref>{{cite book |last1=A.C.Grayling |title=The history of philosophy |date=2019 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=9780241304556 |page=397}}</ref>\n\nPopper's solution to this problem is to flip it upside down. He noticed that while it is impossible to verify that every swan is white, finding a single black swan shows that ''not'' every swan is  white. We might tentatively accept the proposal that every swan is white, while looking out for examples of non-white swans that would show our conjecture to be false. This is the basis of critical rationalism. \n\nFalsification uses the valid inference [[modus tollens]]: if from a statement <math>P</math> (say some law with some initial condition) we logically deduce {{nowrap|<math>Q</math>,}} but what is observed is {{nowrap|<math>\\neg Q</math>,}} <math>P</math> is false. For example, given the law \"all swans are white\" and the initial condition \"there is a swan here\", we can deduce \"the swan here is white\", but if what is observed is \"the swan here is not white\" (say black), then \"all swans are white\" is false, or it was not a swan.<ref name=\"swandecision\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper was aware that a too simplistic view on critical rationalism would be subject to valid criticisms. [[Imre Lakatos|Lakatos]], realizing that Popper's critical rationalism was misunderstood, contrasted it with  weaker versions, which he called dogmatic falsificationism and naive falsificationism.{{sfn|Lakatos|1978|pp=12-30}} Popper's critical rationalism is not (and never has been) one of these two weak versions.<ref name=\"lakatoscreditPopper\" group=upper-alpha/> Also, on the terminological side of this issue, Popper never used the term \"falsificationism\"<ref name=\"poppernotfalsificationismism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> and proposed instead the term \"critical rationalism\".<ref name=\"popperproposecriticalrationalism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>     \n\n===Away from dogmatic falsificationism===\nA dogmatic falsificationist ignores that every observation is theory impregnated. This leads to the critique that we cannot tell which theory is falsified. Is it the one that is being studied or the one behind the observation?<ref name=duhemcritic group=\"upper-alpha\"/> This is sometimes called the 'Duhem\u2013Quine problem'. [[Duhem\u2013Quine_thesis#Example_from_Galilean_astronomy|An example is Galileo's refutation]] of the time-honoured theory that celestial bodies are faultless crystal balls. Many considered that it was the optical theory of the telescope that was false, not the theory of celestial bodies. A dogmatic falsificationist ignores a more subtle fact: only statements can contradict statements. So, it is fundamentally incorrect to say that an observation contradicts a theory. \n\nA dogmatic falsificationist further ignores the role of auxiliary hypotheses, which could explain the contradicting observation. For the falsification to logically occur, we need a [[ceteris paribus]] clause, which says that no auxiliary hypothesis is responsible for the contradicting observation. Again, this leads to the critique that we cannot tell if it is the theory or the ceteris paribus clause that is false. Lakatos gives the example of the path of a planet. If the path contradicts Newton's law, we will not know if it is Newton's law that is false or the assumption that no other body influenced the path.  Popper was aware that one can always find another auxiliary hypothesis,{{efn-ua | [[Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1959|Popper 1959]]. p.19: \"It might be said that even if the asymmetry [between universal and existential statements] is admitted, it is still impossible, for various reasons, that any theoretical system should ever be conclusively falsified. For it is always possible to find some way of evading falsification, for example by introducing ad hoc an auxiliary hypothesis, or by changing ad hoc a definition. It is even possible without logical inconsistency to adopt the position of simply refusing to acknowledge any falsifying experience whatsoever. Admittedly, scientists do not usually proceed in this way, but logically such procedure is possible; and this fact, it might be claimed, makes the logical value of my proposed criterion of demarcation dubious, to say the least.\"}} though he clearly distinguished falsifiable theories such as Newton theory and non falsifiable theories on this respect.<ref name=\"popperagainstceterispabirus\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> \n\nLakatos explains that Popper's solution to these valid criticisms against dogmatic falsificationism requires that we relax the dogmatic assumption that an observation can show a theory to be false<ref name=\"twomeanings\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>: {{Quote| If a theory is falsified [in the usual sense], it is proven false; if it is ''falsified'' [in the technical sense], it may still be true. | author=Imre Lakatos| source={{harvnb|Lakatos|1978|p=24}}}}\nMethodological falsificationism replaces the contradicting observation in a falsification with a \"contradicting observation\" accepted by convention among scientists, a convention that implies three decisions: the theory underlying the observation is correct, no auxiliary hypotheses explain this observation and the written form of the observation matches with an actual observation.<ref name=\"twootherdecisions\" group=\"upper-alpha\"> Lakatos add two other decisions. One of them is needed to accept statistical statements as falsifiable. The other allows even more falsifiable theories.</ref>\n\n===Away from naive falsificationism===\nNaive falsificationism is the claim that methodological falsifications can by themselves explain how we gain scientific knowledge. Very often we must deal with two or more competing theories which can both be non-falsified (say by not making the proper decisions). Considering only falsifications, we cannot explain why we pick one theory above the other. We cannot explain why often a corroborating experiment is seen as a sign of progress. Popper's falsificationism or critical rationalism use both falsifications and corroborations to explain progress in science.<ref name=\"poppernonnaive\" group=\"upper-alpha\" />  How corroborations and falsifications can explain progress in science was a subject of disagreement between many philosophers, especially between Lakatos and Popper.<ref name=\"popper01and2\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper clearly distinguished between the creative and informal process from which theories emerge and the logical and formal process where theories are falsified or corroborated.<ref  name=\"cleardistinctioncomplete\"  group=upper-alpha/><ref name=\"methodologydifferfrompurelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"Poppermethodbeyondlogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> The main issue is whether the decision to select a theory among competing theories in the light of falsifications and corroborations should be moved in the logical part as some kind of formal logic.<ref name=\"zaharonmaindivergence\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is a delicate question, because this logic could be considered as inductive: it selects a universal law in view of instances. The answer of Lakatos and many others to that question is that it should.<ref name=\"naivefalsificationism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"kuhncritic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> In contradistinction, for Popper, the creative and informal part is guided by methodological rules, which naturally say to favor theories that are corroborated<ref name=\"arulethatusescorroborations\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, but this methodology can hardly be made rigorous.<ref  name=\"splitlogicmethod\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Popper does not mention corroborations when he describes the purely logical part.<ref  name=\"poppernoapriori\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/>   \n\nPopper's way to analyze progress in science was through the concept of [[verisimilitude]], a way to define how close a theory is to the truth, which he did not consider very significant, except (as an attempt) to clarify a concept already clear in practice. Later, it was shown that the specific definition proposed by Popper cannot distinguish between two theories that are false, which is the case for all theories in the history of science.<ref name=\"verisimilitudenotsoanissue\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Today, there is still on going research on the general concept of verisimilitude.{{sfn|Fine|2019}}\n\n==Demarcation problem==\n{{main|Demarcation problem}}\nPopper's response to the problem of induction is simply that we do not need induction. He claims that we actually never use induction in science.  Instead, we conjecture the laws, test them and consider the results together with other aspects to decide which laws we apply in practice. In contradistinction, the logical positivism of the so-called [[Vienna Circle]], which included such philosophers as [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Otto Neurath]], and [[logical empiricism]] of [[A.J. Ayer]]. holds that a law must, in principle, be empirically verifiable in order that it be scientific. Here, ''empirically verifiable'' means that observations can show it to be true. To defend his approach against this verifiability criterion, which was at the time the accepted approach to demarcate science from non-science, Popper criticized its practical side. He also criticized the basic philosophical motivation of the logical positivists.\n\nOn the practical side, Popper's dissatisfaction with the general attitude associated with verificationism originated with his encounter with psychoanalysis in the years 1910. It did not matter what observation was presented, psychoanalysis could explain it. Unfortunately, the reason why it could explain everything is that it did not exclude anything also. For Popper, this was a failure, because it meant that it could not make any prediction. From a logical standpoint, if we find an observation that does not contradict a law, it does not mean that the law is true.  A verification has no value in itself.  But, if the law makes risky predictions and these are corroborated, Popper says, we have a reason to prefer this law over another law that makes less risky predictions or no predictions at all.   \n\nOn the basic philosophical side, Popper noticed that the philosophers of the Vienna Circle had mixed two different problems, that of meaning and that of demarcation, and had proposed in verificationism a single solution to both: a statement that could not be verified was considered meaningless and thus useless.  In opposition to this view, Popper emphasized that there are meaningful theories that are not scientific, and that, accordingly, a criterion of meaningfulness does not coincide with a [[demarcation problem|criterion of demarcation]].\n\nTo further defend his solution to the demarcation problem, Popper had to establish his critical rationalism on the solid ground of logic.  A clean arena for logical falsification was needed, but he himself pointed out  issues such as the fact that observations are theory impregnated (see sections [[#Away_from_dogmatic_falsificationism]] and [[#Away_from_naive_falsificationism]] for this issue and other issues).\n\n==Controversies==\n===Kuhn===\n{{main|Thomas Kuhn}}\n[[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]] emphasized aspects of science that were not much considered by Popper. In particular, he analyzed what he calls periods of normal science as well as revolutions from one period of normal science to another, whereas Popper's view is that only revolutions are relevant.<ref name=\"watkinsonPopperVsKuhn\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>  For Popper, the role of science, mathematics and metaphysics, actually the role of any knowledge,  is to solve puzzles. In the same line of thought,  Kuhn observes that in periods of normal science the scientific theories, which are created under some paradigm, are used to routinely solve puzzles and the validity of the paradigm is hardly in question. It's only when important new puzzles emerge that cannot be solved by accepted theories that a revolution might occur. This can be seen as a viewpoint on the distinction made by Popper between the informal and formal process in science (see [[#Away_from_naive_falsificationism]]). In the big picture presented by Kuhn, the routinely solved puzzles are corroborations. Falsifications or otherwise unexplained observations are unsolved puzzles. All of these are used in the informal process that generates a new kind of theory.  Kuhn says that Popper emphasizes formal or logical falsifications and fails to explain how the social and informal process works.\n\n===Feyerabend===\n{{main|Paul Feyerabend}}\nPaul Feyerabend examined the history of science with a more critical eye, and ultimately rejected any prescriptive methodology at all. He rejected Lakatos' argument for ad hoc hypothesis, arguing that science would not have progressed without making use of any and all available methods to support new theories. He rejected any reliance on a scientific method, along with any special authority for science that might derive from such a method.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=}} Rather, he claimed that if one is keen to have a universally valid methodological rule, [[epistemological anarchism]] or ''anything goes'' would be the only candidate. For Feyerabend, any special status that science might have derives from the social and physical value of the results of science rather than its method.{{sfn | Broad | 1979 }}\n\n===Sokal and Bricmont===\nIn their book ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'' (from 1997, published in the UK as ''Intellectual Impostures'') the physicists [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] criticised falsifiability.  They include this critique in the \"Intermezzo\" chapter, where they expose their own views on truth in contrast to the extreme epistemological relativism of postmodernism.  Even though Popper is clearly not a relativist, Sokal and Bricmont discuss falsifiability because they see postmodernist epistemological relativism as a reaction to Popper's insistence on falsifiability, and more generally, to his theory of science.\n\n==Applications==\n{{Missing information|how falsifiability relates to fundamental concepts such as probability theory and the principle of parsimony required to discuss most of its applications|talksection=talksection|date=April 2020}}\n===Use in courts of law===\nFalsifiability has been used in the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case (in 1982), the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case (in 1993) and other cases. A survey of 303 federal judges conducted in 1998 revealed that  \"[P]roblems with the nonfalsifiable nature of an expert\u2019s underlying theory and difficulties with an unknown or too-large error rate were cited in less than 2% of cases.\"{{efn-ua |Surveys were mailed to all active U.S. district court judges in November 1998 (N &#61; 619). 303 usable surveys were obtained for a response rate of 51%.}}\n\n==== ''McLean v. Arkansas'' case ====\nIn the ruling of the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case, Judge [[William Overton (judge)|William Overton]] used falsifiability as one of the criteria to determine that \"[[creation science]]\" was not scientific and should not be taught in [[Arkansas]] [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] as such (it can be taught as religion). In his testimony, philosopher [[Michael Ruse]] defined the characteristics which constitute science as (see {{harvnb|Pennock|2000|p=5}} and {{harvnb|Ruse|2010}}):\n* It is guided by natural law;\n* It has to be  explanatory by reference to natural law; \n* It is testable against the empirical world;\n* Its conclusions are tentative, i.e., are not necessarily the final word; and\n* It is falsifiable.\nIn his conclusion related to this criterion Judge Overton stated that {{Quote|text=While anybody is free to approach a scientific inquiry in any fashion they choose, they cannot properly describe the methodology as scientific, if they start with the conclusion and refuse to change it regardless of the evidence developed during the course of the investigation.|sign=William Overton|source={{harvnb|McLean v. Arkansas|1982|loc=at the end of section IV. (C)}}}}\n\n==== ''Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals'' case ====\nIn the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case, the [[majority opinion]] proposed the so-called [[Daubert standard#Definition|five Daubert factors]], which include falsifiability, to define a scientific methodology that is acceptable in courts of law.{{efn-ua | The Daubert case and subsequent cases that used it as a reference, including ''[[General Electric Co. v. Joiner]]'' and ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'', resulted in an amendment of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] (see {{harvnb|Rules of Evidence|2017|p=15|loc=Rule 702}} and {{harvnb|Rule 702 Notes|2011}}). The ''Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael'' case and other cases considered the original Daubert factors, but the amended rule, rule 702, even though it is often referred to as the [[Daubert standard]], does not include the original Daubert factors or mention falsifiability or [[testability]] and neither does the majority opinion delivered  by [[William Rehnquist]]  in the ''General Electric Co. v. Joiner'' case.}} These original Daubert factors have been cited in the ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'' case and in the ''U.S. v. PRIME'' case {{harv|United States v. Prime|2002}}.  In the Daubert case, Associate Justice [[Harry Blackmun]], delivering the [[majority opinion]] of the [[United States Supreme Court]], has cited Popper and other philosophers of science: {{Quote|text=Ordinarily, a key question to be answered in determining whether  a  theory  or  technique  is  scientific  knowledge  that will  assist  the  trier  of  fact  will  be  whether  it  can  be  (and has been) tested.

However, when these predictions were not in fact borne out, the theory was saved from falsification by the addition of ''ad hoc'' hypotheses which made it compatible with the facts. By this means, Popper asserted, a theory which was initially genuinely scientific degenerated into pseudo-scientific dogma.\"}}\n\nSome economists, such as those of the [[Austrian School]], believe that [[macroeconomics]] is [[Empiricism|empirically]] unfalsifiable and that thus the only appropriate means to understand economic events is by [[deductive reasoning|logically]] studying [[Subjective theory of value|the intentions]] of [[methodological individualism|individual economic decision-makers]], [[Praxeology#Austrian School approach|based on]] certain fundamental [[Action axiom|truths]].{{sfn|Heath|2015}}{{sfn|Mises|1998|p=11}} Prominent figures within the Austrian School of economics, [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich Hayek]] were associates of Karl Popper, with whom they co-founded the [[Mont Pelerin Society]].\n\n===Evolution===\n{{Main|Objections to evolution#Unfalsifiability|l1=Objections to evolution: Unfalsifiability}}\nNumerous examples of potential (indirect) ways to falsify common descent have been proposed by its proponents.

Confronting such evidence, some adherents make an [[Omphalos hypothesis|argument]] (called the [[Omphalos hypothesis]]) that the world was created with the appearance of age; e.g., the sudden appearance of a mature chicken capable of laying eggs.  This hypothesis is non-falsifiable since no evidence about the age of the earth (or any astronomical feature) can be shown not to be fabricated during creation.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Historicism===\nTheories of [[history]] or politics that allegedly predict future events have a [[logical form]] that renders them neither falsifiable nor verifiable. They claim that for every historically significant event, there exists an historical or economic law that ''determines'' the way in which events proceeded. Failure to identify the law does not mean that it does not exist, yet an event that satisfies the law does not prove the general case. Evaluation of such claims is at best difficult. On this basis, Popper \"fundamentally criticized historicism in the sense of any preordained prediction of history\"{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  and argued that neither [[Marxism]] nor [[psychoanalysis]] was science,{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  although both made such claims. Again, this does not mean that any of these types of theories is necessarily ''incorrect''. Popper considered falsifiability a test of whether theories are scientific, not of whether propositions that they contain or support are true.\n\n===Mathematics===\nLike all [[formal science]]s, mathematics is not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the [[Empiricism|empirical]] world, but rather, mathematics is occupied with the theoretical, abstract study of such topics as [[quantity]], [[structure]], [[space]] and [[Calculus|change]]. Methods of the mathematical sciences are, however, applied in constructing and testing scientific models dealing with observable [[reality]]. [[Albert Einstein]] wrote, \"One reason why mathematics enjoys special esteem, above all other sciences, is that its laws are absolutely certain and indisputable, while those of other sciences are to some extent debatable and in constant danger of being overthrown by newly discovered facts.\"{{sfn|Einstein|2010}}\n\n{{See also|Mathematical proof|Scientific method#Relationship with mathematics|l2=Scientific method and mathematics|Mathematics#Mathematics as science|l3=Mathematics as science|Philosophy of mathematics#Popper's_two_senses_of_number_statements|l4=Popper's \"two senses\" theory}}\n\n==See also==\n{{div col}}\n* {{annotated link|Black swan theory}}\n* {{annotated link|Contingency (philosophy)|Contingency}}\n* {{annotated link|Critical rationalism}}\n* {{annotated link|Defeasible reasoning}}\n* {{annotated link|Duhem\u2013Quine thesis}}\n* {{annotated link|Experimentum crucis|''Experimentum crucis''}}\n* {{annotated link|Explanatory power}}\n* {{annotated link|Fallibilism}}\n* {{annotated link|Fallacy}} ([[informal logic]] and [[rhetoric]])\n* {{annotated link|Raven paradox}}, or Hempel's paradox\n* {{annotated link|Hitchens's razor}}\n* {{annotated link|Hypothetico-deductive model}}\n* {{annotated link|Inquiry}}\n* {{annotated link|Metaphysical solipsism}}\n* {{annotated link|Methodological solipsism}}\n* {{annotated link|Mike Alder|Newton's Flaming Laser Sword}}\n* {{annotated link|Occam's razor}}\n* {{annotated link|Philosophy of mathematics}}\n* {{annotated link|Philosophy of science}}\n* {{annotated link|Pragmatic maxim}}\n* {{annotated link|Precambrian rabbit}}\n* {{annotated link|Predictive power}}\n* {{annotated link|Reproducibility}}\n* {{annotated link|Russell's teapot}}\n* {{annotated link|Superseded scientific theories}}\n* {{annotated link|Tautology (logic)|Tautology}}\n* {{annotated link|Theory-ladenness}}\n* {{annotated link|Trial and error}}\n{{div col end}}\n{{Wiktionary pipe | falsifiable | falsifiability}}\n{{clear}}\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist| group=upper-alpha| refs=\n\n<ref name=\"affirmtheconsequentVsinductivelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\">The fallacy affirming the consequent is: p &#10230; q & q; therefore p.

For example, \"All swans are white\" is falsifiable because  \"Here is a black swan\" shows it to be false. Formally, it is the same, except that the observations used to prove falsifiability are only logical constructions distinct from those that are truly possible.<ref name=\"formaldefinition\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"somecontradiction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nFalsifiability differs from [[Logical_positivism|verifiability]], which was held as fundamental by many philosophers such as those of the [[Vienna Circle]]. In order to verify the claim \"All swans are white\" one would have to observe every swan, which is not possible, whereas the single observation \"Here is a black swan\" is sufficient to falsify it. \n\nIt was introduced by the [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] [[Karl Raimund Popper|Karl Popper]] in his book ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'' (1934), as an answer to both the [[Problem of Induction]] and  the [[Demarcation Problem]].  He saw falsifiability as the cornerstone of [[critical rationalism]], his theory of science.{{sfn|Popper|1989|pp=82-85}}\n\nAs a key notion in the separation of science from non-science, it has featured prominently in many scientific controversies and applications, even being used as legal precedent.\n\n==The problem of induction==\nOne of the questions in [[Scientific method]] is: how does one move from observations to laws? This is the [[problem of induction]].  Suppose we want to put the theory that all swans are white to the test. We come across a white swan. We cannot validly argue from \"here is a white swan\" to \"all swans are white\"; doing so would require a fallacious logic such as, for example, [[affirming the consequent]].<ref name=\"affirmtheconsequentVsinductivelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref>{{cite book |last1=A.C.Grayling |title=The history of philosophy |date=2019 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=9780241304556 |page=397}}</ref>\n\nPopper's solution to this problem is to flip it upside down. He noticed that while it is impossible to verify that every swan is white, finding a single black swan shows that ''not'' every swan is  white. We might tentatively accept the proposal that every swan is white, while looking out for examples of non-white swans that would show our conjecture to be false. This is the basis of critical rationalism. \n\nFalsification uses the valid inference [[modus tollens]]: if from a statement <math>P</math> (say some law with some initial condition) we logically deduce {{nowrap|<math>Q</math>,}} but what is observed is {{nowrap|<math>\\neg Q</math>,}} <math>P</math> is false. For example, given the law \"all swans are white\" and the initial condition \"there is a swan here\", we can deduce \"the swan here is white\", but if what is observed is \"the swan here is not white\" (say black), then \"all swans are white\" is false, or it was not a swan.<ref name=\"swandecision\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper was aware that a too simplistic view on critical rationalism would be subject to valid criticisms. [[Imre Lakatos|Lakatos]], realizing that Popper's critical rationalism was misunderstood, contrasted it with  weaker versions, which he called dogmatic falsificationism and naive falsificationism.{{sfn|Lakatos|1978|pp=12-30}} Popper's critical rationalism is not (and never has been) one of these two weak versions.<ref name=\"lakatoscreditPopper\" group=upper-alpha/> Also, on the terminological side of this issue, Popper never used the term \"falsificationism\"<ref name=\"poppernotfalsificationismism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> and proposed instead the term \"critical rationalism\".<ref name=\"popperproposecriticalrationalism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>     \n\n===Away from dogmatic falsificationism===\nA dogmatic falsificationist ignores that every observation is theory impregnated. This leads to the critique that we cannot tell which theory is falsified. Is it the one that is being studied or the one behind the observation?<ref name=duhemcritic group=\"upper-alpha\"/> This is sometimes called the 'Duhem\u2013Quine problem'. [[Duhem\u2013Quine_thesis#Example_from_Galilean_astronomy|An example is Galileo's refutation]] of the time-honoured theory that celestial bodies are faultless crystal balls. Many considered that it was the optical theory of the telescope that was false, not the theory of celestial bodies. A dogmatic falsificationist ignores a more subtle fact: only statements can contradict statements. So, it is fundamentally incorrect to say that an observation contradicts a theory. \n\nA dogmatic falsificationist further ignores the role of auxiliary hypotheses, which could explain the contradicting observation. For the falsification to logically occur, we need a [[ceteris paribus]] clause, which says that no auxiliary hypothesis is responsible for the contradicting observation. Again, this leads to the critique that we cannot tell if it is the theory or the ceteris paribus clause that is false. Lakatos gives the example of the path of a planet. If the path contradicts Newton's law, we will not know if it is Newton's law that is false or the assumption that no other body influenced the path.  Popper was aware that one can always find another auxiliary hypothesis,{{efn-ua | [[Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1959|Popper 1959]]. p.19: \"It might be said that even if the asymmetry [between universal and existential statements] is admitted, it is still impossible, for various reasons, that any theoretical system should ever be conclusively falsified. For it is always possible to find some way of evading falsification, for example by introducing ad hoc an auxiliary hypothesis, or by changing ad hoc a definition. It is even possible without logical inconsistency to adopt the position of simply refusing to acknowledge any falsifying experience whatsoever. Admittedly, scientists do not usually proceed in this way, but logically such procedure is possible; and this fact, it might be claimed, makes the logical value of my proposed criterion of demarcation dubious, to say the least.\"}} though he clearly distinguished falsifiable theories such as Newton theory and non falsifiable theories on this respect.<ref name=\"popperagainstceterispabirus\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> \n\nLakatos explains that Popper's solution to these valid criticisms against dogmatic falsificationism requires that we relax the dogmatic assumption that an observation can show a theory to be false<ref name=\"twomeanings\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>: {{Quote| If a theory is falsified [in the usual sense], it is proven false; if it is ''falsified'' [in the technical sense], it may still be true. | author=Imre Lakatos| source={{harvnb|Lakatos|1978|p=24}}}}\nMethodological falsificationism replaces the contradicting observation in a falsification with a \"contradicting observation\" accepted by convention among scientists, a convention that implies three decisions: the theory underlying the observation is correct, no auxiliary hypotheses explain this observation and the written form of the observation matches with an actual observation.<ref name=\"twootherdecisions\" group=\"upper-alpha\"> Lakatos add two other decisions. One of them is needed to accept statistical statements as falsifiable. The other allows even more falsifiable theories.</ref>\n\n===Away from naive falsificationism===\nNaive falsificationism is the claim that methodological falsifications can by themselves explain how we gain scientific knowledge. Very often we must deal with two or more competing theories which can both be non-falsified (say by not making the proper decisions). Considering only falsifications, we cannot explain why we pick one theory above the other. We cannot explain why often a corroborating experiment is seen as a sign of progress. Popper's falsificationism or critical rationalism use both falsifications and corroborations to explain progress in science.<ref name=\"poppernonnaive\" group=\"upper-alpha\" />  How corroborations and falsifications can explain progress in science was a subject of disagreement between many philosophers, especially between Lakatos and Popper.<ref name=\"popper01and2\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper clearly distinguished between the creative and informal process from which theories emerge and the logical and formal process where theories are falsified or corroborated.<ref  name=\"cleardistinctioncomplete\"  group=upper-alpha/><ref name=\"methodologydifferfrompurelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"Poppermethodbeyondlogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> The main issue is whether the decision to select a theory among competing theories in the light of falsifications and corroborations should be moved in the logical part as some kind of formal logic.<ref name=\"zaharonmaindivergence\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is a delicate question, because this logic could be considered as inductive: it selects a universal law in view of instances. The answer of Lakatos and many others to that question is that it should.<ref name=\"naivefalsificationism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"kuhncritic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> In contradistinction, for Popper, the creative and informal part is guided by methodological rules, which naturally say to favor theories that are corroborated<ref name=\"arulethatusescorroborations\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, but this methodology can hardly be made rigorous.<ref  name=\"splitlogicmethod\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Popper does not mention corroborations when he describes the purely logical part.<ref  name=\"poppernoapriori\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/>   \n\nPopper's way to analyze progress in science was through the concept of [[verisimilitude]], a way to define how close a theory is to the truth, which he did not consider very significant, except (as an attempt) to clarify a concept already clear in practice. Later, it was shown that the specific definition proposed by Popper cannot distinguish between two theories that are false, which is the case for all theories in the history of science.<ref name=\"verisimilitudenotsoanissue\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Today, there is still on going research on the general concept of verisimilitude.{{sfn|Fine|2019}}\n\n==Demarcation problem==\n{{main|Demarcation problem}}\nPopper's response to the problem of induction is simply that we do not need induction. He claims that we actually never use induction in science.  Instead, we conjecture the laws, test them and consider the results together with other aspects to decide which laws we apply in practice. In contradistinction, the logical positivism of the so-called [[Vienna Circle]], which included such philosophers as [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Otto Neurath]], and [[logical empiricism]] of [[A.J. Ayer]]. holds that a law must, in principle, be empirically verifiable in order that it be scientific. Here, ''empirically verifiable'' means that observations can show it to be true. To defend his approach against this verifiability criterion, which was at the time the accepted approach to demarcate science from non-science, Popper criticized its practical side. He also criticized the basic philosophical motivation of the logical positivists.\n\nOn the practical side, Popper's dissatisfaction with the general attitude associated with verificationism originated with his encounter with psychoanalysis in the years 1910. It did not matter what observation was presented, psychoanalysis could explain it. Unfortunately, the reason why it could explain everything is that it did not exclude anything also. For Popper, this was a failure, because it meant that it could not make any prediction. From a logical standpoint, if we find an observation that does not contradict a law, it does not mean that the law is true.  A verification has no value in itself.  But, if the law makes risky predictions and these are corroborated, Popper says, we have a reason to prefer this law over another law that makes less risky predictions or no predictions at all.   \n\nOn the basic philosophical side, Popper noticed that the philosophers of the Vienna Circle had mixed two different problems, that of meaning and that of demarcation, and had proposed in verificationism a single solution to both: a statement that could not be verified was considered meaningless and thus useless.  In opposition to this view, Popper emphasized that there are meaningful theories that are not scientific, and that, accordingly, a criterion of meaningfulness does not coincide with a [[demarcation problem|criterion of demarcation]].\n\nTo further support his solution to the demarcation problem, Popper had to establish his critical rationalism on the solid ground of logic.  A clean arena for logical falsification was needed, but he himself pointed out  issues such as the fact that observations are theory impregnated (see sections [[#Away_from_dogmatic_falsificationism]] and [[#Away_from_naive_falsificationism]] for this issue and other issues).\n\n==Controversies==\n===Kuhn===\n{{main|Thomas Kuhn}}\n[[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]] emphasized aspects of science that were not much considered by Popper. In particular, he analyzed what he calls periods of normal science as well as revolutions from one period of normal science to another, whereas Popper's view is that only revolutions are relevant.<ref name=\"watkinsonPopperVsKuhn\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>  For Popper, the role of science, mathematics and metaphysics, actually the role of any knowledge,  is to solve puzzles. In the same line of thought,  Kuhn observes that in periods of normal science the scientific theories, which are created under some paradigm, are used to routinely solve puzzles and the validity of the paradigm is hardly in question. It's only when important new puzzles emerge that cannot be solved by accepted theories that a revolution might occur. This can be seen as a viewpoint on the distinction made by Popper between the informal and formal process in science (see [[#Away_from_naive_falsificationism]]). In the big picture presented by Kuhn, the routinely solved puzzles are corroborations. Falsifications or otherwise unexplained observations are unsolved puzzles. All of these are used in the informal process that generates a new kind of theory.  Kuhn says that Popper emphasizes formal or logical falsifications and fails to explain how the social and informal process works.\n\n===Feyerabend===\n{{main|Paul Feyerabend}}\nPaul Feyerabend examined the history of science with a more critical eye, and ultimately rejected any prescriptive methodology at all. He rejected Lakatos' argument for ad hoc hypothesis, arguing that science would not have progressed without making use of any and all available methods to support new theories. He rejected any reliance on a scientific method, along with any special authority for science that might derive from such a method.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=}} Rather, he claimed that if one is keen to have a universally valid methodological rule, [[epistemological anarchism]] or ''anything goes'' would be the only candidate. For Feyerabend, any special status that science might have derives from the social and physical value of the results of science rather than its method.{{sfn | Broad | 1979 }}\n\n===Sokal and Bricmont===\nIn their book ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'' (from 1997, published in the UK as ''Intellectual Impostures'') the physicists [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] criticised falsifiability.  They include this critique in the \"Intermezzo\" chapter, where they expose their own views on truth in contrast to the extreme epistemological relativism of postmodernism.  Even though Popper is clearly not a relativist, Sokal and Bricmont discuss falsifiability because they see postmodernist epistemological relativism as a reaction to Popper's insistence on falsifiability, and more generally, to his theory of science.\n\n==Applications==\n{{Missing information|how falsifiability relates to fundamental concepts such as probability theory and the principle of parsimony required to discuss most of its applications|talksection=talksection|date=April 2020}}\n===Use in courts of law===\nFalsifiability has been used in the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case (in 1982), the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case (in 1993) and other cases. A survey of 303 federal judges conducted in 1998 revealed that  \"[P]roblems with the nonfalsifiable nature of an expert\u2019s underlying theory and difficulties with an unknown or too-large error rate were cited in less than 2% of cases.\"{{efn-ua |Surveys were mailed to all active U.S. district court judges in November 1998 (N &#61; 619). 303 usable surveys were obtained for a response rate of 51%.}}\n\n==== ''McLean v.

In his testimony, philosopher [[Michael Ruse]] defined the characteristics which constitute science as (see {{harvnb|Pennock|2000|p=5}} and {{harvnb|Ruse|2010}}):\n* It is guided by natural law;\n* It has to be  explanatory by reference to natural law; \n* It is testable against the empirical world;\n* Its conclusions are tentative, i.e., are not necessarily the final word; and\n* It is falsifiable.\nIn his conclusion related to this criterion Judge Overton stated that {{Quote|text=While anybody is free to approach a scientific inquiry in any fashion they choose, they cannot properly describe the methodology as scientific, if they start with the conclusion and refuse to change it regardless of the evidence developed during the course of the investigation.|sign=William Overton|source={{harvnb|McLean v.

Carmichael]]'', resulted in an amendment of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] (see {{harvnb|Rules of Evidence|2017|p=15|loc=Rule 702}} and {{harvnb|Rule 702 Notes|2011}}). The ''Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael'' case and other cases considered the original Daubert factors, but the amended rule, rule 702, even though it is often referred to as the [[Daubert standard]], does not include the original Daubert factors or mention falsifiability or [[testability]] and neither does the majority opinion delivered  by [[William Rehnquist]]  in the ''General Electric Co. v. Joiner'' case.}} These original Daubert factors have been cited in the ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'' case and in the ''U.S. v. PRIME'' case {{harv|United States v. Prime|2002}}.  In the Daubert case, Associate Justice [[Harry Blackmun]], delivering the [[majority opinion]] of the [[United States Supreme Court]], has cited Popper and other philosophers of science: {{Quote|text=Ordinarily, a key question to be answered in determining whether  a  theory  or  technique  is  scientific  knowledge  that will  assist  the  trier  of  fact  will  be  whether  it  can  be  (and has been) tested.

Confronting such evidence, some adherents make an [[Omphalos hypothesis|argument]] (called the [[Omphalos hypothesis]]) that the world was created with the appearance of age; e.g., the sudden appearance of a mature chicken capable of laying eggs.  This hypothesis is non-falsifiable since no evidence about the age of the earth (or any astronomical feature) can be shown not to be fabricated during creation.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Historicism===\nTheories of [[history]] or politics that allegedly predict future events have a [[logical form]] that renders them neither falsifiable nor verifiable. They claim that for every historically significant event, there exists an historical or economic law that ''determines'' the way in which events proceeded. Failure to identify the law does not mean that it does not exist, yet an event that satisfies the law does not prove the general case. Evaluation of such claims is at best difficult. On this basis, Popper \"fundamentally criticized historicism in the sense of any preordained prediction of history\"{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  and argued that neither [[Marxism]] nor [[psychoanalysis]] was science,{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  although both made such claims. Again, this does not mean that any of these types of theories is necessarily ''incorrect''. Popper considered falsifiability a test of whether theories are scientific, not of whether propositions that they contain or support are true.\n\n===Mathematics===\nLike all [[formal science]]s, mathematics is not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the [[Empiricism|empirical]] world, but rather, mathematics is occupied with the theoretical, abstract study of such topics as [[quantity]], [[structure]], [[space]] and [[Calculus|change]]. Methods of the mathematical sciences are, however, applied in constructing and testing scientific models dealing with observable [[reality]].

It is an [[action role-playing video game]] based on the [[anime]] series of the same title (''[[Magic Knight Rayearth]]'').  Though one of the first games for the Saturn, it became the last Saturn game released in North America, chiefly due to its prolonged [[internationalization and localization]]. The game was released in North America by [[Working Designs]] in 1998.\n\nThe game focuses on three characters who travel the world of Cephiro to rescue an abducted princess named Emerald.\n\n==Plot==\nThe overall plot is very similar to the first story arc in the [[Magic Knight Rayearth|manga and anime]], with eight-grade girls [[Hikaru Shidou]], [[Umi Ryuuzaki]] and [[Fuu Hououji]] finding themselves drawn from their respective field trips to the [[Tokyo Tower]] into the world of Cephiro. There, Master Mage Clef inform them that, in order to return to Tokyo, the three girls must become the Magic Knights and rescue Cephiro's current Pillar, Princess Emeraude (named as Princess Emerald in the English version), from her abductor, the high priest and antagonist Zagato (named as Zagat in the English version).\n\nAll of the characters from the first arc of the manga are present in the game, as well as anime-exclusive character Inouva. However, the game presents several new locations and characters, thus considerably expanding the overall plot. The player can also read each of the girls' journals, which receive new entries after key events in the game, providing their individual insights on the events.\n\nUnlike in the manga and anime, all of Zagato's minions die throughout the game, including Ascot, Caldina and Rafarga.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:Magicknightrayearth1.jpg|thumb|left|Screenshot depicting the three protagonists: Hikaru, Umi, and Fuu]]\n\nThroughout the game, the player controls a [[Party (role-playing games)|party]] of three characters. However, only one character can battle at a time; though the other two characters will follow behind the active character, they cannot attack and are unaffected by all enemy attacks and even environmental hazards. The player can instantly change the active character at any time.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Protos: Magic Knight Rayearth|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=99|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=October 1997|page=42}}</ref> In essence, the three characters confront the enemies, puzzles, and assorted threats of the game in a [[tag team]] fashion.\n\nUnlike most RPGs, [[Experience level|character upgrades]] and magic spells are mostly acquired upon progressing to certain points in the game, rather than by independent accomplishments. (The exceptions are [[Health (gaming)|maximum HP]] and [[Magic point|maximum MP]], which are increased by finding special items.) This is much like the Saturn's first RPG, ''[[Virtual Hydlide]]'', with the important difference that weapons and armor in ''Magic Knight Rayearth'' are upgraded as part of general level ups and do not exist as distinct gameplay elements.\n\nWhile the anime and manga both have the Magic Knights using color-coordinated swords, in the game only Hikaru uses a sword, while Umi uses a [[Foil (fencing)|foil]] and Fuu a bow and arrow.  Each of the three weapons has its own advantages and disadvantages. For instance, the bow works long range but requires precise aim, whereas the sword slices with broad strokes that make it easy to hit enemies but is short range only.

It is an [[action role-playing video game]] based on the [[anime]] series of the same title (''[[Magic Knight Rayearth]]'').  Though one of the first games for the Saturn, it became the last Saturn game released in North America, chiefly due to its prolonged [[internationalization and localization]]. The game was released in North America by [[Working Designs]] in 1998.\n\nThe game focuses on three characters who travel the world of Cephiro to rescue an abducted princess named Emerald.\n\n==Plot==\nThe overall plot is very similar to the first story arc in the [[Magic Knight Rayearth|manga and anime]], with eight-grade girls [[Hikaru Shidou]], [[Umi Ryuuzaki]] and [[Fuu Hououji]] finding themselves drawn from their respective field trips to the [[Tokyo Tower]] into the world of Cephiro. There, Master Mage Clef inform them that, in order to return to Tokyo, the three girls must become the Magic Knights and rescue Cephiro's current Pillar, Princess Emeraude (named as Princess Emerald in the English version), from her abductor, the high priest and antagonist Zagato (named as Zagat in the English version).\n\nAll of the characters from the first arc of the manga are present in the game, as well as anime-exclusive character Inouva. However, the game presents several new locations and characters, thus considerably expanding the overall plot. The player can also read each of the girls' journals, which receive new entries after key events in the game, providing their individual insights on the events.\n\nUnlike in the manga and anime, all of Zagato's minions die throughout the game, including Ascot, Caldina and Rafarga\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:Magicknightrayearth1.jpg|thumb|left|Screenshot depicting the three protagonists: Hikaru, Umi, and Fuu]]\n\nThroughout the game, the player controls a [[Party (role-playing games)|party]] of three characters. However, only one character can battle at a time; though the other two characters will follow behind the active character, they cannot attack and are unaffected by all enemy attacks and even environmental hazards. The player can instantly change the active character at any time.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Protos: Magic Knight Rayearth|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=99|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=October 1997|page=42}}</ref> In essence, the three characters confront the enemies, puzzles, and assorted threats of the game in a [[tag team]] fashion.\n\nUnlike most RPGs, [[Experience level|character upgrades]] and magic spells are mostly acquired upon progressing to certain points in the game, rather than by independent accomplishments. (The exceptions are [[Health (gaming)|maximum HP]] and [[Magic point|maximum MP]], which are increased by finding special items.) This is much like the Saturn's first RPG, ''[[Virtual Hydlide]]'', with the important difference that weapons and armor in ''Magic Knight Rayearth'' are upgraded as part of general level ups and do not exist as distinct gameplay elements.\n\nWhile the anime and manga both have the Magic Knights using color-coordinated swords, in the game only Hikaru uses a sword, while Umi uses a [[Foil (fencing)|foil]] and Fuu a bow and arrow.  Each of the three weapons has its own advantages and disadvantages. For instance, the bow works long range but requires precise aim, whereas the sword slices with broad strokes that make it easy to hit enemies but is short range only. The need to aim the bow is mostly removed once it is upgraded, since Fuu can then charge the weapon to make it \"lock on\" to the nearest target. However, unlike the sword and foil, the bow's attack power does not increase when it is charged up.\n\n==Development ==\n''Magic Knight Rayearth'' is based on the anime by [[Clamp (manga artists)|Clamp]] of the [[Magic Knight Rayearth|same name]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.maniac.de/extended/zelda-nein-danke-abenteuerliche-alternativen/|title=Zelda?

These genes are located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 2 at position 24.3 and code for the alpha subunit of the transmembrane sodium channel protein. A mutation in either of these two genes will cause an individual to develop dysfunctional sodium channels, which are crucial in the pathway for sending chemical signals in the brain, causing the phenotypic display of myoclonic epilepsy from the individual. A properly functioning channel would respond to a voltage difference across the membrane and form a pore through which only sodium ions can pass. The influx of sodium induces the generation of action potential by temporarily changing the charge of the cell. When the gene is mutated, the eventually translated protein improperly folds its pore segment within the cell membrane because it has different amino acid chemistry, which renders the channel inactive. It is also possible for a mutation to reduce the number of channels produced by an individual, which leads to the development of Dravet syndrome.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1535-7597.2005.05105.x |pmid=16059449 |pmc=1176321 |title=A Plethora of SCN1A Mutations: What Can They Tell Us? |journal=Epilepsy Currents |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=17\u201320 |year=2005 |last1=Wallace |first1=Robyn }}</ref>\n\nCurrently, the SCN1A gene is the most clinically relevant; the largest number of epilepsy related mutations characterized thus far occur in this gene.<ref name=\"GeneReview1\"/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sugawara T, Tsurubuchi Y, Agarwala KL, Ito M, Fukuma G, Mazaki-Miyazaki E, Nagafuji H, Noda M, Imoto K, Wada K, Mitsudome A, Kaneko S, Montal M, Nagata K, Hirose S, Yamakawa K | year = 2001 | title = A missense mutation of the Na+ channel alpha II subunit gene Na(v)1.2 in a patient with febrile and afebrile seizures causes channel dysfunction | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 98 | issue = 11| pages = 6384\u20139 | doi=10.1073/pnas.111065098 | pmid=11371648 | pmc=33477}}</ref> Typically, a [[missense mutation]] in either the S5 or S6 segment of the sodium channel pore results in a loss of channel function and the development of Dravet syndrome.

These genes are located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 2 at position 24.3 and code for the alpha subunit of the transmembrane sodium channel protein. A mutation in either of these two genes will cause an individual to develop dysfunctional sodium channels, which are crucial in the pathway for sending chemical signals in the brain, causing the phenotypic display of myoclonic epilepsy from the individual. A properly functioning channel would respond to a voltage difference across the membrane and form a pore through which only sodium ions can pass. The influx of sodium induces the generation of action potential by temporarily changing the charge of the cell. When the gene is mutated, the eventually translated protein improperly folds its pore segment within the cell membrane because it has different amino acid chemistry, which renders the channel inactive. It is also possible for a mutation to reduce the number of channels produced by an individual, which leads to the development of Dravet syndrome.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1535-7597.2005.05105.x |pmid=16059449 |pmc=1176321 |title=A Plethora of SCN1A Mutations: What Can They Tell Us? |journal=Epilepsy Currents |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=17\u201320 |year=2005 |last1=Wallace |first1=Robyn }}</ref>\n\nCurrently, the SCN1A gene is the most clinically relevant; the largest number of epilepsy related mutations characterized thus far occur in this gene.<ref name=\"GeneReview1\"/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sugawara T, Tsurubuchi Y, Agarwala KL, Ito M, Fukuma G, Mazaki-Miyazaki E, Nagafuji H, Noda M, Imoto K, Wada K, Mitsudome A, Kaneko S, Montal M, Nagata K, Hirose S, Yamakawa K | year = 2001 | title = A missense mutation of the Na+ channel alpha II subunit gene Na(v)1.2 in a patient with febrile and afebrile seizures causes channel dysfunction | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 98 | issue = 11| pages = 6384\u20139 | doi=10.1073/pnas.111065098 | pmid=11371648 | pmc=33477}}</ref> Typically, a [[missense mutation]] in either the S5 or S6 segment of the sodium channel pore results in a loss of channel function and the development of Dravet syndrome.
