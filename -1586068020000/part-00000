The [[George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]] was then appointed to negotiate a treaty with the King of France.  He was amazed by how smoothly it went.  This treaty closely followed the secret treaty just concluded, but the clause by which King Charles was to declare himself a Roman Catholic as soon as the affairs of his kingdom permitted did not appear; neither, therefore, did the stipulation that the attack on the Netherlands would follow his declaration.  This treaty was signed by all five members of the [[Cabal Ministry]] on 21 December 1670 and was made known to the public. However King Charles and the French knew it was a meaningless fake.<ref>Antonia Fraser, ''Royal Charles: Charles II and the Restoration'' (1979), pp. 275&ndash;276</ref><ref>Ogg, ''England in the Reign of Charles II'' vol 1 pp 346-48.</ref><ref>Tim Harris, ''Restoration: Charles II and his kingdoms, 1660-1685'' (2006) p 71.</ref>\n\n==Consequences==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2018}}<!--2 paragraphs without citations-->\nMilitary preparations took some time; Louis declared war on the Dutch on 6 April 1672, and Charles followed suit the next day. On 14 April 1672 under the Treaty of Stockholm, France paid Sweden subsidies to remain neutral, while also promising Sweden military support if it were threatened by [[Brandenburg-Prussia]]. This Franco-Swedish alliance completed in Louis\u2019 diplomatic encirclement of the Republic and ended the Triple Alliance.<ref>Roger Frost, ''The Northern Wars 1558\u20131721 p. 209.</ref>\n\nThe [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]] started badly for the Dutch. The French strategy was to invade the Dutch Republic along the line of the River [[Rhine]] where Dutch defences were weakest, outflanking the main defences on the Dutch Border with the Spanish Netherlands. Despite warnings about French intentions, the Dutch leader [[Johan de Witt]] mistakenly thought that the war against France and England would be decided at sea, and he prioritised equipping the Dutch fleet while neglecting the eastern frontier fortresses.{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=179-181, 185}} This lead to significant French successes and a near-collapse of the Dutch army, which was forced to retreat behind the inundations of [[The Dutch Water Line]]. The year 1672 is known to the Dutch as the ''[[Rampjaar]]'' or 'Year of disaster': the [[Orangism (Dutch Republic)| Orangists]] blamed de Witt who they forced to resign and later the brutally killed  him and his brother.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|p=81}}{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=193, 197-198, 220}} \n\nThe breathing space afforded by the Dutch retreat behind the inundations, followed by military reforms, recruitment of new troops and unofficial Spanish assistance, enabled them to hold the Dutch Water Line for the rest of 1672 and 1673. Louis was now involved in a war of attrition and faced growing opposition from other European powers. Despite his, Charles was short of money, despite French subsidies, and he faced increasing domestic opposition to the war.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|p=72}}\n\nThe costs of deploying the English fleet were much greater than expected, and the money sent by Louis to offset the costs did not come close to being sufficient. Furthermore, the Dutch, led by [[William III of England|Captain-General William of Orange]] put up a much better fight than expected. Desperate for funds, Charles was forced to call Parliament into session for the first time in over two years. He had hoped to keep it [[legislative session#Procedure in Commonwealth realms|prorogued]] in order to wage the war without its oversight.  In 1674, largely because of pressure put upon Charles by Parliament, England signed the [[Treaty of Westminster (1674)|Treaty of Westminster]] ending their involvement in the third Anglo-Dutch War.  The French would continue to fight for four more years before signing the [[Treaty of Nijmegen]].\n\nIn 1672, Charles issued a [[Royal Declaration of Indulgence|Declaration of Indulgence]] which suspended the penal laws against [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconforming]] Protestants and also relaxed (but did not suspend) the penal laws applying to Roman Catholics.  When Parliament reconvened that year, they denounced the Declaration and announced that the English monarch did not possess the power to issue proclamations that suspended penal laws passed by the Parliament. Furthermore, they refused to fund the ongoing [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]] until the declaration was withdrawn. Charles was forced to comply with Parliament's demands, thereby ending the chance offered by the treaty of reconciling England with the Roman Catholic Church.<ref>Ogg, ''England in the Reign of Charles II'' vol 1 pp 354-55, 365-68.</ref>\n\nThe treaty's reference to the possibility of \"new rights to the Spanish monarchy reverting to the King of France\" envisaged the possibility of the Spanish King [[Charles II of Spain|Charles]] dying childless, and of Louis then claiming the Spanish throne for the House of Bourbon. At the time of the treaty, the Spanish monarch was only nine years old, but his infirmity was already evident and well-known, casting doubt on his ever being able to beget children. However, by the time when it did happen - the King of Spain indeed dying childless in 1700 - the orientation of British foreign policy had completely reversed. Far from the King of England aiding the French one in \"maintaining his Spanish rights\", Britain went to a major war - the [[War of Spanish Succession]] - in order to block these French ambitions.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of treaties]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{citation | last = Ady | first = Julia | title = Madame, a Life of Henrietta, Daughter of Charles I and Duchess of Orleans |  publisher = Seeley & Co | place = London | year = 1894 | pages = 332\u201333 | url = https://archive.org/stream/madamealifehenr02adygoog#page/n354/mode/2up}}.\n* {{cite journal|last=Boxer|first=C.

The [[George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]] was then appointed to negotiate a treaty with the King of France.  He was amazed by how smoothly it went.  This treaty closely followed the secret treaty just concluded, but the clause by which King Charles was to declare himself a Roman Catholic as soon as the affairs of his kingdom permitted did not appear; neither, therefore, did the stipulation that the attack on the Netherlands would follow his declaration.  This treaty was signed by all five members of the [[Cabal Ministry]] on 21 December 1670 and was made known to the public. However King Charles and the French knew it was a meaningless fake.<ref>Antonia Fraser, ''Royal Charles: Charles II and the Restoration'' (1979), pp. 275&ndash;276</ref><ref>Ogg, ''England in the Reign of Charles II'' vol 1 pp 346-48.</ref><ref>Tim Harris, ''Restoration: Charles II and his kingdoms, 1660-1685'' (2006) p 71.</ref>\n\n==Consequences==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2018}}<!--2 paragraphs without citations-->\nMilitary preparations took some time; Louis declared war on the Dutch on 6 April 1672, and Charles followed suit the next day. On 14 April 1672 under the Treaty of Stockholm, France paid Sweden subsidies to remain neutral, while also promising Sweden military support if it were threatened by [[Brandenburg-Prussia]]. This Franco-Swedish alliance completed in Louis\u2019 diplomatic encirclement of the Republic and ended the Triple Alliance.<ref>Roger Frost, ''The Northern Wars 1558\u20131721 p. 209.</ref>\n\nThe [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]] started badly for the Dutch. The French strategy was to invade the Dutch Republic along the line of the River [[Rhine]] where Dutch defences were weakest, outflanking the main defences on the Dutch Border with the Spanish Netherlands. Despite warnings about French intentions, the Dutch leader [[Johan de Witt]] mistakenly thought that the war against France and England would be decided at sea, and he prioritised equipping the Dutch fleet while neglecting the eastern frontier fortresses.{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=179-181, 185}} This lead to significant French successes and a near-collapse of the Dutch army, which was forced to retreat behind the inundations of [[The Dutch Water Line]]. The year 1672 is known to the Dutch as the ''[[Rampjaar]]'' or 'Year of disaster': the [[Orangism (Dutch Republic)| Orangists]] blamed de Witt who they forced to resign and later the brutally killed  him and his brother.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|p=81}}{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=193, 197-198, 220}} \n\nThe breathing space afforded by the Dutch retreat behind the inundations, followed by military reforms, recruitment of new troops and unofficial Spanish assistance, enabled them to hold the Dutch Water Line for the rest of 1672 and 1673. Louis was now involved in a war of attrition and faced growing opposition from other European powers. Despite his, Charles was short of money, despite French subsidies, and he faced increasing domestic opposition to the war.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|p=72}}\n\nThe costs of deploying the English fleet were much greater than expected, and the money sent by Louis to offset the costs did not come close to being sufficient. Furthermore, the Dutch, led by [[William III of England|Captain-General William of Orange]] put up a much better fight than expected. Desperate for funds, Charles was forced to call Parliament into session for the first time in over two years. He had hoped to keep it [[legislative session#Procedure in Commonwealth realms|prorogued]] in order to wage the war without its oversight.  In 1674, largely because of pressure put upon Charles by Parliament, England signed the [[Treaty of Westminster (1674)|Treaty of Westminster]] ending their involvement in the third Anglo-Dutch War.  The French would continue to fight for four more years before signing the [[Treaty of Nijmegen]].\n\nIn 1672, Charles issued a [[Royal Declaration of Indulgence|Declaration of Indulgence]] which suspended the penal laws against [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconforming]] Protestants and also relaxed (but did not suspend) the penal laws applying to Roman Catholics.  When Parliament reconvened that year, they denounced the Declaration and announced that the English monarch did not possess the power to issue proclamations that suspended penal laws passed by the Parliament. Furthermore, they refused to fund the ongoing [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]] until the declaration was withdrawn. Charles was forced to comply with Parliament's demands, thereby ending the chance offered by the treaty of reconciling England with the Roman Catholic Church.<ref>Ogg, ''England in the Reign of Charles II'' vol 1 pp 354-55, 365-68.</ref>\n\nThe treaty's reference to the possibility of \"new rights to the Spanish monarchy reverting to the King of France\" envisaged the possibility of the Spanish King [[Charles II of Spain|Charles]] dying childless, and of Louis then claiming the Spanish throne for the House of Bourbon. At the time of the treaty, the Spanish monarch was only nine years old, but his infirmity was already evident and well-known, casting doubt on his ever being able to beget children. However, by the time when it did happen - the King of Spain indeed dying childless in 1700 - the orientation of British foreign policy had completely reversed. Far from the King of England aiding the French one in \"maintaining his Spanish rights\", Britain went to a major war - the [[War of Spanish Succession]] - in order to block these French ambitions.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of treaties]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite journal|last=Boxer|first=C.

They lived in makeshift huts called ''gunyahs'', hunted native animals such as kangaroos, fished in the Nepean River, and gathered local fruits and vegetables such as yams. They lived under an elaborate system of Law which had its origins in the [[Dreamtime]]. Most of the Mulgoa were killed by [[smallpox]] or ''galgala'' shortly after the arrival of the [[First Fleet]] in 1788. Early British explorers such as [[Watkin Tench]] described them as friendly, saying, \"they bade us adieu, in unabated friendship and good humour\".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mananura.com/aboriginal-history-dharugtx.html | title=The Dharug Story | author=Christopher Tobin | publisher=Mananura Aboriginal Centre | accessdate=18 May 2008 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929223218/http://www.mananura.com/aboriginal-history-dharugtx.html | archivedate=29 September 2007 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==European exploration==\nThe recorded history of Penrith began on 26 June 1789. Eighteen months after the landing of the [[First Fleet]], an exploring party led by [[Watkin Tench|Captain Watkin Tench]] set out to further discoveries made by Governor [[Arthur Phillip]] earlier in the month. In the daylight hours of 27 June, Tench and his party discovered the broad expanse of the [[Nepean River]]. Tench\u2019s party became the first Europeans to see the site of what is now the City of Penrith. Tench later wrote \u2018we found ourselves on the banks of a river, nearly as broad as the  [[Thames]] at [[Putney]] and apparently of great depth\u2019. Phillip later named the river after [[Evan Nepean]], the under-secretary of state in the Home Office, who had been largely responsible for the organisation of the First Fleet. From this point, European settlement began in earnest, firstly on the Hawkesbury River, and later southward up the Nepean.\n\n===European settlement===\nGovernor [[Phillip Gidley King]] began granting land in the area to settlers in 1804 with Captain [[Daniel Woodriff]]'s {{convert|1000|acre|km2}} on the banks of the river the first land grant in the area. The first government building in the district was the military depot built (at the present Penrith police station) by [[William Cox (pioneer)|William Cox]], in mid-1815 near the new Road ([[Great Western Road (New South Wales)|Great Western Road]]) on unassigned Crown land, set well back from the river. It represented the formalisation of law and order in the district. Its placement seems to have been a practical decision by Cox, placing it on flood-free Crown land on the new road to Parramatta, just east of Woodriff\u2019s Rodley Farm. Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]] paid Cox \u00a3200 for \u2018erecting a Depot for Provisions, Guard House, erecting necessary Enclosures for cattle and Garden Ground, Frame for a Well \u2026 on the new  near Emu Ford\u2019.  At this time, Emu Ford was one of the few locality names that would indicate the depot\u2019s position.\n\nIn 1816 Cox mentioned the lockup at \u2018Penryhn\u2019, among a list of expenses. There appears little doubt that he was referring to the depot that was later referred to as Penrith. The name for the new depot, Penrhyn, may have simply been misinterpreted by others.  Penrhyn was possibly named after the First Fleet ship that carried women convicts, the ''Lady Penrhyn''. There is no historical evidence to prove Macquarie's hand in naming the depot, especially considering he often endowed and recorded benefactors with that favour. Furthermore,  Macquarie would have ensured that a plan of the town would have been drawn up.  No documentary evidence has shed any light on Macquarie\u2019s  reasoning for the placement of this depot and its connection with his vision for a township at Castlereagh.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Penrith: The Makings of a City|last=Stacker|first=Lorraine|publisher=Halstead Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1-920831-76-9|location=Penrith City Library|pages=17\u201320}}</ref>\n\nWhat is clear is that the origin of the name, Penrith is steeped in mystery. Penrith was possibly named after [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]] in Cumbria by someone who knew the old town and who noted geographical similarities. By 1819, the name Penrith was in use with its first reference in the ''Sydney Gazette'' on 8 December 1821 appointing John Proctor as keeper of the new gaol and court house.\n\nThe lockup at Penrith placed government law and order in the centre of the Evan district. This group of buildings became the point of contact for local administration for anything ranging from issuing publican\u2019s licences, holding inquests and church services. Although a magistrate had been appointed to Castlereagh in 1811, the Penrith lockup increased in importance with its promotion to a court house in 1817. A bench of magistrates was appointed: [[Sir John Jamison]], the Reverend Henry Fulton, John McHenry and a military officer from the regiment stationed there. In 1814, [[William Cox (pioneer)|William Cox]] constructed a [[Great Western Highway|road]] across the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]] which passed through Woodriff's land at Penrith. Initial settlement in the area was unplanned but substantial enough for a courthouse to be established in 1817.<ref name=\"profile\">{{cite web|url=http://www.penrithcity.nsw.gov.au/index.asp?id=436|title=Local suburb profile \u2013 Penrith|publisher=Penrith City Council|accessdate=18 May 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614014522/http://www.penrithcity.nsw.gov.au/index.asp?id=436|archivedate=14 June 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe post office was established in 1828, the Anglican church, St Stephens, was opened and consecrated 16 July 1839<ref name=\"NINETY YEARS OLD\">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16549948 |title=Ninety Years Old |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=22 July 1929 |accessdate=7 November 2014 |page=11 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> followed by the Catholic Church, St Nicholas of Myra, in 1850.

In 1824, Sir John erected the colony's finest [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] mansion, [[Regentville]] House, near Penrith, on a ridge overlooking the Nepean River. Sir John established an impressive agricultural estate at Regentville and became a Member of the [[New South Wales Legislative Council]]. His grave can be seen in St Stephen's graveyard.

They lived in makeshift huts called ''gunyahs'', hunted native animals such as kangaroos, fished in the Nepean River, and gathered local fruits and vegetables such as yams. They lived under an elaborate system of Law which had its origins in the [[Dreamtime]]. Most of the Mulgoa were killed by [[smallpox]] or ''galgala'' shortly after the arrival of the [[First Fleet]] in 1788. Early British explorers such as [[Watkin Tench]] described them as friendly, saying, \"they bade us adieu, in unabated friendship and good humour\".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mananura.com/aboriginal-history-dharugtx.html | title=The Dharug Story | author=Christopher Tobin | publisher=Mananura Aboriginal Centre | accessdate=18 May 2008 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929223218/http://www.mananura.com/aboriginal-history-dharugtx.html | archivedate=29 September 2007 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==European exploration==\nThe recorded history of Penrith began on 26 June 1789. Eighteen months after the landing of the [[First Fleet]], an exploring party led by [[Watkin Tench|Captain Watkin Tench]] set out to further discoveries made by Governor [[Arthur Phillip]] earlier in the month. In the daylight hours of 27 June, Tench and his party discovered the broad expanse of the [[Nepean River]]. Tench\u2019s party became the first Europeans to see the site of what is now the City of Penrith. Tench later wrote \u2018we found ourselves on the banks of a river, nearly as broad as the  [[Thames]] at [[Putney]] and apparently of great depth\u2019. Phillip later named the river after [[Evan Nepean]], the under-secretary of state in the Home Office, who had been largely responsible for the organisation of the First Fleet. From this point, European settlement began in earnest, firstly on the Hawkesbury River, and later southward up the Nepean.\n\n===European settlement===\nGovernor [[Phillip Gidley King]] began granting land in the area to settlers in 1804 with Captain [[Daniel Woodriff]]'s {{convert|1000|acre|km2}} on the banks of the river the first land grant in the area. The first government building in the district was the military depot built (at the present Penrith police station) by [[William Cox (pioneer)|William Cox]], in mid-1815 near the new Road ([[Great Western Road (New South Wales)|Great Western Road]]) on unassigned Crown land, set well back from the river. It represented the formalisation of law and order in the district. Its placement seems to have been a practical decision by Cox, placing it on flood-free Crown land on the new road to Parramatta, just east of Woodriff\u2019s Rodley Farm. Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]] paid Cox \u00a3200 for \u2018erecting a Depot for Provisions, Guard House, erecting necessary Enclosures for cattle and Garden Ground, Frame for a Well \u2026 on the new  near Emu Ford\u2019.  At this time, Emu Ford was one of the few locality names that would indicate the depot\u2019s position.\n\nIn 1816 Cox mentioned the lockup at \u2018Penryhn\u2019, among a list of expenses. There appears little doubt that he was referring to the depot that was later referred to as Penrith. The name for the new depot, Penrhyn, may have simply been misinterpreted by others.  Penrhyn was possibly named after the First Fleet ship that carried women convicts, the ''Lady Penrhyn''. There is no historical evidence to prove Macquarie's hand in naming the depot, especially considering he often endowed and recorded benefactors with that favour. Furthermore,  Macquarie would have ensured that a plan of the town would have been drawn up.  No documentary evidence has shed any light on Macquarie\u2019s  reasoning for the placement of this depot and its connection with his vision for a township at Castlereagh.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Penrith: The Makings of a City|last=Stacker|first=Lorraine|publisher=Halstead Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1-920831-76-9|location=Penrith City Library|pages=17\u201320}}</ref>\n\nWhat is clear is that the origin of the name, Penrith is steeped in mystery. Penrith was possibly named after [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]] in Cumbria by someone who knew the old town and who noted geographical similarities. By 1819, the name Penrith was in use with its first reference in the ''Sydney Gazette'' on 8 December 1821 appointing John Proctor as keeper of the new gaol and court house.\n\nThe lockup at Penrith placed government law and order in the centre of the Evan district. This group of buildings became the point of contact for local administration for anything ranging from issuing publican\u2019s licences, holding inquests and church services. Although a magistrate had been appointed to Castlereagh in 1811, the Penrith lockup increased in importance with its promotion to a court house in 1817. A bench of magistrates was appointed: [[Sir John Jamison]], the Reverend Henry Fulton, John McHenry and a military officer from the regiment stationed there. In 1814, [[William Cox (pioneer)|William Cox]] constructed a [[Great Western Highway|road]] across the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]] which passed through Woodriff's land at Penrith. Initial settlement in the area was unplanned but substantial enough for a courthouse to be established in 1817.<ref name=\"profile\">{{cite web|url=http://www.penrithcity.nsw.gov.au/index.asp?id=436|title=Local suburb profile \u2013 Penrith|publisher=Penrith City Council|accessdate=18 May 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614014522/http://www.penrithcity.nsw.gov.au/index.asp?id=436|archivedate=14 June 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe post office was established in 1828, the Anglican church, St Stephens, was opened and consecrated 16 July 1839<ref name=\"NINETY YEARS OLD\">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16549948 |title=Ninety Years Old |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=22 July 1929 |accessdate=7 November 2014 |page=11 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> followed by the Catholic Church, St Nicholas of Myra, in 1850.

In 1824, Sir John erected the colony's finest [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] mansion, [[Regentville]] House, near Penrith, on a ridge overlooking the Nepean River. Sir John established an impressive agricultural estate at Regentville and became a Member of the [[New South Wales Legislative Council]]. His grave can be seen in St Stephen's graveyard. Regentville House burned down in 1868 but most of its stonework was salvaged and used for building projects in and around Penrith.\n\nThe first bridge, financed by local business [[James Tobias Ryan|James Tobias (Toby) Ryan]]<ref name=\"Ryan ADB\">{{cite AuDB |id2=ryan-james-tobias-toby-4529 |title=Ryan, James Tobias (Toby) (1818\u20131899) |first=B G |last=Andrews |access-date=6 May 2019}}</ref> was opened over the Nepean in 1856 and was washed away the following year in a flood.

Night-time temperatures are a few degrees cooler than Sydney on most nights of the year. In extreme cases, there could be a temperature differential of 10 degrees Celsius in summer, owing to [[sea breeze|sea breezes]], which affect coastal areas much more than areas further from the ocean and do not usually penetrate as far inland as Penrith.
