The [[Collapse of Communism|collapse of communism]] set in motion events that led to the withdrawal of the [[People's Army of Vietnam|Vietnamese armed forces]], which had established their presence in the country since the [[Khmer Rouge#Fall|fall of the Khmer Rouge]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usip.org/publications/2017/05/lessons-cambodias-paris-peace-accords-political-unrest-today|title=Lessons from Cambodia's Paris Peace Accords for Political Unrest Today|website=United States Institute of Peace|language=en|access-date=2018-06-14}}</ref> The [[Constitution of Cambodia|1993 constitution]], which is currently in force, was promulgated as a result of the [[1991 Paris Peace Agreements]], followed by [[1993 Cambodian general election|elections]] organized under the aegis of the [[United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia]]. The constitution proclaims a liberal, multiparty democracy in which powers are devolved to the [[Executive (government)|executive]], the [[judiciary]] and the [[legislature]]. However, there is no effective opposition to the Prime Minister [[Hun Sen]], who has been in power for over 35 years. His [[Cambodian People's Party]] won all 125 seats in the National Assembly in 2018 after the banning of opposition party [[CNRP]]. Furthermore, the governing charter declares Cambodia to be an \"independent, sovereign, peaceful, permanently neutral and non-aligned State.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xXQ6Od8xVMsC&pg=PA210&lpg=PA210&dq=independent,+sovereign,+peaceful,+permanently+neutral+and+non-aligned+State+cambodia#v=onepage&q=independent,%20sovereign,%20peaceful,%20permanently%20neutral%20and%20non-aligned%20State%20cambodia&f=false|title=Framing the State in Times of Transition: Case Studies in Constitution Making|last=Miller|first=Laurel E.|last2=Aucoin|first2=Louis|date=2010|publisher=US Institute of Peace Press|isbn=9781601270559|location=|pages=210|language=en}}</ref>\n\nExecutive power is exercised by the Royal Government, on behalf of and with the consent of the monarch. The government is constituted of the Council of Ministers, headed by the prime minister. The prime minister is aided in his functions by members of the Council such as deputy prime ministers, senior ministers and other ministers. Legislative power is vested in a [[Bicameralism|bicameral legislature]] composed of the [[National Assembly of Cambodia|National Assembly]], which has the power to vote on draft law, and the [[Senate of Cambodia|Senate]], that has the power of review. Upon passage of legislation through the two chambers, the draft law is presented to the monarch for signing and promulgation. The judiciary is tasked with the protection of rights and liberties of the citizens, and with being an impartial arbiter of disputes. The Supreme Court is the highest court of the country and takes appeals from lower courts on questions of law. A separate body called the Constitutional Council was established to provide interpretations of the constitution and the laws, and also to resolve disputes related to election of members of the legislature.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/Cambodia.html|title=Overview of the Cambodian History, Governance and Legal Sources - GlobaLex|website=www.nyulawglobal.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-14}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Cambodian People's Party]] has dominated the political landscape since the [[1997 clashes in Cambodia|1997 armed clashes]] in Phnom Penh.

The assembly adopted the basic principles and measures mandated under the [[1991 Paris Peace Agreements|Paris Peace Agreements]] into the text of the constitution.

The King is officially the [[Head of State]] and is the symbol of unity and \"perpetuity\" of the nation, as defined by Cambodia's constitution.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cambodia 1993 (rev. 2008)|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Cambodia_2008?lang=en#26|website=Constitute|accessdate=17 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nFrom September 24, 1993 through October 7, 2004, [[Norodom Sihanouk]] reigned as King, after having previously served in a number of offices (including King) since 1941. Under the Constitution, the King has no political power, but as Norodom Sihanouk was revered in the country, his word often carried much influence in the government.  While such views are not prevalent in Cambodia, his word was respected by his subjects. The King, often irritated over the conflicts in his government, several times threatened to abdicate unless the political factions in the government got along. This put pressure on the government to solve their differences.  This influence of the King was often used to help mediate differences in government.\n\nAfter the abdication of King Norodom Sihanouk in 2004, he was succeeded by his son [[Norodom Sihamoni]]. While the retired King was highly revered in his country for dedicating his lifetime to Cambodia, the current King has spent most of his life abroad in [[France]]. Thus, it remains to be seen whether the new King's views will be as highly respected as his father's.\n\nAlthough in the [[Khmer language]] there are many words meaning \"king\", the word officially used in Khmer (as found in the 1993 Cambodian Constitution) is ''preahm\u00e2haksat'' (Khmer regular script: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u1798\u17a0\u17b6\u1780\u17d2\u179f\u178f\u17d2\u179a), which literally means: ''preah''- (\"excellent\", cognate of the [[Pali]] word [[w:wiktionary:vara#Pali|vara]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sealang.net/api/api.pl?query=%E1%9E%96%E1%9F%92%E1%9E%9A%E1%9F%87&service=dictionary|title=Native orthography for \"\u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\", SEAlang Dictionary|website=sealang.net|access-date=2019-03-28}}</ref>) -''m\u00e2ha''- (from [[Sanskrit]], meaning \"great\", cognate with \"maha-\" in [[maharaja]]) -''ksat'' (\"warrior, ruler\", cognate of the Sanskrit word [[w:wiktionary:\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0924\u094d\u0930|k\u1e63atr\u00e1]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sealang.net/api/api.pl?query=%E1%9E%80%E1%9F%92%E1%9E%9F%E1%9E%8F%E1%9F%92%E1%9E%9A&service=dictionary|title=Native orthography for \"\u1780\u17d2\u179f\u178f\u17d2\u179a\", SEAlang Dictionary|website=sealang.net|access-date=2019-03-28}}</ref>).\n\nOn the occasion of King Norodom Sihanouk's retirement in September 2004, the Cambodian National Assembly coined a new word for the retired king: ''preahm\u00e2haviraksat'' (Khmer regular script: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u1798\u17a0\u17b6\u179c\u17b8\u179a\u1780\u17d2\u179f\u178f\u17d2\u179a), where ''vira'' comes from Sanskrit ''v\u012bra'', meaning \"brave or eminent man, hero, chief\", cognate of [[Latin]] ''vir'', ''viris'', [[English language|English]] ''virile''. ''Preahm\u00e2haviraksat'' is translated in English as \"King-Father\" ({{lang-fr|Roi-P\u00e8re}}), although the word \"father\" does not appear in the Khmer noun.\n\nAs ''preahm\u00e2haviraksat'', Norodom Sihanouk retained many of the prerogatives he formerly held as ''preahm\u00e2haksat'' and was a highly respected and listened-to figure. Thus, in effect, Cambodia could be described as a country with two Kings during Sihanouk's lifetime: the one who was the Head of State, the ''preahm\u00e2haksat'' Norodom Sihamoni, and the one who was not the Head of State, the ''preahm\u00e2haviraksat'' Norodom Sihanouk.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nSihanouk died of a pulmonary infarction on October 15, 2012.\n\n===Succession to the throne===\nUnlike most monarchies, Cambodia's monarchy is not necessarily [[hereditary monarchy|hereditary]] and the King is not allowed to select his own heir.  Instead, a new King is chosen by a Royal Council of the Throne, consisting of the president of the National Assembly, the Prime Minister, the President of the Senate, the First and Second Vice Presidents of the Senate, the Chiefs of the orders of [[Buddhism in Cambodia#Cambodian adaptations|Mohanikay and Thammayut]], and the First and Second Vice-President of the Assembly.  The Royal Council meets within a week of the King's death or abdication and selects a new King from a pool of candidates with royal blood.\n\nIt has been suggested that Cambodia's ability to peacefully appoint a new King shows that Cambodia's government has stabilized incredibly from the situation the country was in during the 1970s (see [[History of Cambodia]]).\n\n==Executive branch==\n[[File:Hun_Sen_(2016)_cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Hun Sen]] \u2013 [[Prime Minister of Cambodia|Prime Minister]]]]\n[[File:Seal of the Cabinet of Cambodia.svg|thumb|Seal of the Royal Government]]The [[Prime Minister of Cambodia]] is a representative from the ruling party of the National Assembly. He or she is appointed by the King on the recommendation of the President and Vice Presidents of the National Assembly.  In order for a person to become Prime Minister, he or she must first be given a vote of confidence by the National Assembly.\n\nThe Prime Minister is officially the [[Head of Government]] in Cambodia. Upon entry into office, he or she appoints a Council of Ministers who are responsible to the Prime Minister.  Officially, the Prime Minister's duties include chairing meetings of the Council of Ministers (Cambodia's version of a [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]]) and appointing and leading a government. The Prime Minister and his government make up Cambodia's [[executive (government)|executive branch]] of government.\n\nThe current Prime Minister is [[Cambodian People's Party]] (CPP) member [[Hun Sen]]. He has held this position since the criticized 1998 election, one year after the CPP staged a bloody [[coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]] in Phnom Penh<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cambodia.ohchr.org/Documents/Statements%20and%20Speeches/English/40.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-06-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070627054853/http://cambodia.ohchr.org/Documents/Statements%20and%20Speeches/English/40.pdf |archivedate=2007-06-27 }}</ref><ref>http://www.hri.org/docs/statedep/1997/97-07-08.std.html</ref> to overthrow elected Prime Minister Prince [[Norodom Ranariddh]], president of the [[FUNCINPEC]] party.\n\n==Legislative branch==\n{{update|section|date=December 2013 }}\nThe [[legislature|legislative branch]] of the Cambodian government is made up of a [[bicameral]] [[parliament]].\n\n* The '''[[National Assembly of Cambodia|National Assembly]]''' (''Radhsaphea'') has 125 members, elected for a five-year term by [[proportional representation]].\n* The '''[[Senate of Cambodia|Senate]]''' (''Protsaphea'') has 61 members.  Two of these members are appointed by the King, two are elected by the lower house of the government, and the remaining fifty-seven are elected popularly by \"functional constituencies.\"  Members in this house serve a six-year term.\n\nThe official duty of the Parliament is to legislate and make laws.  Bills passed by the Parliament are given to the King who gives the proposed bills [[royal assent]].  The King does not have [[veto]] power over bills passed by the National Assembly and thus, cannot withhold royal assent.  The National Assembly also has the power to dismiss the Prime Minister and his government by a two-thirds [[vote of no confidence]].\n\n===Senate===\n\nThe upper house of the Cambodian legislature is called the ''Senate''. It consists of sixty-one members.  Two of these members are appointed by the King, two are elected by the lower house of the government, and the remaining fifty-seven are elected popularly by electors from provincial and local governments, in a similar fashion to the [[Senate of France]]. Members in this house serve six-year terms.\n\nPrior to 2006, elections had last been held for the Senate in 1999. New elections were supposed to have occurred in 2004, but these elections were initially postponed. On January 22, 2006, 11,352 possible voters went to the poll and chose their candidates. This election was criticized by local monitoring non-governmental organizations as being undemocratic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4638406.stm|title=Ruling party wins Cambodia poll|author=|date=19 May 2018|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2006}}, the [[Cambodian People's Party]] holds forty-three seats in the Senate, constituting a significant majority. The two other major parties holding seats in the Senate are the [[Funcinpec]] party (holding twelve seats) and the [[Sam Rainsy Party]] (holding two seats).\n\n===National Assembly===\n\nThe lower house of the legislature is called the ''National Assembly''.  It is made up of 125 members, elected by popular vote to serve a five-year term.  Elections were last held for the National Assembly in July 2013.\n\nIn order to vote in legislative elections, one must be at least eighteen years of age. However, in order to be elected to the Legislature, one must be at least twenty-five years of age.\n\nThe National Assembly is led by a President and two Vice Presidents who are selected by Assembly members prior to each session.\n\n{{As of|2018}}, the [[Cambodian People's Party]] holds all 125 seats in the National Assembly.\n\n==Political parties and elections==\n[[File:Sam Rainsy (cropped).jpg|170px|thumb|right|Former opposition leader and CNRP President [[Sam Rainsy]]]]\n[[File:Norodom Ranariddh (2014).jpg|170px|thumb|right|Former First Prime Minister and FUNCINPEC President [[Norodom Ranariddh]]]]\n{{elect|List of political parties in Cambodia|Elections in Cambodia}}\n\n===2018 general election results===\n{{#section-h:2018 Cambodian general election|Results}}\n\n==Judicial branch==\n\nThe [[judiciary|judicial branch]] is independent from the rest of the government, as specified by the Cambodian [[Constitution]]. The highest court of judicial branch is the [[Supreme Council of the Magistracy]]. Other, lower courts also exist. Until 1997, Cambodia did not have a judicial branch of government despite the nation's Constitution requiring one.\n\nThe main duties of the judiciary are to prosecute criminals, settle lawsuits, and, most importantly, protect the freedoms and rights of Cambodian citizens. However, in reality, the judicial branch in Cambodia is highly corrupt and often serves as a tool of the executive branch to silence civil society and its leaders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2006/01/18/cambod12269.htm|title=Essential Background: Overview of human rights issues in Cambodia |website=Human Rights Watch|date=31 December 2005}}</ref> There are currently 17 justices on the Supreme Council.\n\n==International organization participation==\n[[Agence de Coop\u00e9ration Culturelle et Technique|ACCT]], [[Asian Development Bank|AsDB]], [[ASEAN]], [[United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific|ESCAP]], [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]], [[Group of 77|G-77]], [[International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]], [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development|IBRD]], [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]], [[International Criminal Court|ICC]], [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|ICRM]], [[International Development Association|IDA]], [[International Fund for Agricultural Development|IFAD]], IFC, [[IFRCS]], [[International Labour Organization|ILO]], [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], IMO, [[Intelsat]] (nonsignatory user), [[International Monetary Fund]], [[Interpol]], [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]], [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] (subscriber), [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]], NAM, [[Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons|OPCW]], [[Permanent Court of Arbitration|PCA]], [[United Nations|UN]], [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development|UNCTAD]], [[UNESCO]], [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization|UNIDO]], [[Universal Postal Union|UPU]], [[World Bank|WB]], WFTU, [[World Health Organization|WHO]], [[World Intellectual Property Organization|WIPO]], [[World Meteorological Organization|WMO]], [[World Trade Organization|WTO]], [[World Tourism Organization|WToO]], [[World Trade Organization|WTrO]] (applicant)\n\n=== International rankings ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The King is officially the [[Head of State]] and is the symbol of unity and \"perpetuity\" of the nation, as defined by Cambodia's constitution.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cambodia 1993 (rev. 2008)|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Cambodia_2008?lang=en#26|website=Constitute|accessdate=17 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nFrom September 24, 1993 through October 7, 2004, [[Norodom Sihanouk]] reigned as King, after having previously served in a number of offices (including King) since 1941. Under the Constitution, the King has no political power, but as Norodom Sihanouk was revered in the country, his word often carried much influence in the government.  While such views are not prevalent in Cambodia, his word was respected by his subjects. The King, often irritated over the conflicts in his government, several times threatened to abdicate unless the political factions in the government got along. This put pressure on the government to solve their differences.  This influence of the King was often used to help mediate differences in government.\n\nAfter the abdication of King Norodom Sihanouk in 2004, he was succeeded by his son [[Norodom Sihamoni]]. While the retired King was highly revered in his country for dedicating his lifetime to Cambodia, the current King has spent most of his life abroad in [[France]]. Thus, it remains to be seen whether the new King's views will be as highly respected as his father's.\n\nAlthough in the [[Khmer language]] there are many words meaning \"king\", the word officially used in Khmer (as found in the 1993 Cambodian Constitution) is ''preahm\u00e2haksat'' (Khmer regular script: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u1798\u17a0\u17b6\u1780\u17d2\u179f\u178f\u17d2\u179a), which literally means: ''preah''- (\"excellent\", cognate of the [[Pali]] word [[w:wiktionary:vara#Pali|vara]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sealang.net/api/api.pl?query=%E1%9E%96%E1%9F%92%E1%9E%9A%E1%9F%87&service=dictionary|title=Native orthography for \"\u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\", SEAlang Dictionary|website=sealang.net|access-date=2019-03-28}}</ref>) -''m\u00e2ha''- (from [[Sanskrit]], meaning \"great\", cognate with \"maha-\" in [[maharaja]]) -''ksat'' (\"warrior, ruler\", cognate of the Sanskrit word [[w:wiktionary:\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0924\u094d\u0930|k\u1e63atr\u00e1]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sealang.net/api/api.pl?query=%E1%9E%80%E1%9F%92%E1%9E%9F%E1%9E%8F%E1%9F%92%E1%9E%9A&service=dictionary|title=Native orthography for \"\u1780\u17d2\u179f\u178f\u17d2\u179a\", SEAlang Dictionary|website=sealang.net|access-date=2019-03-28}}</ref>).\n\nOn the occasion of King Norodom Sihanouk's retirement in September 2004, the Cambodian National Assembly coined a new word for the retired king: ''preahm\u00e2haviraksat'' (Khmer regular script: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u1798\u17a0\u17b6\u179c\u17b8\u179a\u1780\u17d2\u179f\u178f\u17d2\u179a), where ''vira'' comes from Sanskrit ''v\u012bra'', meaning \"brave or eminent man, hero, chief\", cognate of [[Latin]] ''vir'', ''viris'', [[English language|English]] ''virile''. ''Preahm\u00e2haviraksat'' is translated in English as \"King-Father\" ({{lang-fr|Roi-P\u00e8re}}), although the word \"father\" does not appear in the Khmer noun.\n\nAs ''preahm\u00e2haviraksat'', Norodom Sihanouk retained many of the prerogatives he formerly held as ''preahm\u00e2haksat'' and was a highly respected and listened-to figure. Thus, in effect, Cambodia could be described as a country with two Kings during Sihanouk's lifetime: the one who was the Head of State, the ''preahm\u00e2haksat'' Norodom Sihamoni, and the one who was not the Head of State, the ''preahm\u00e2haviraksat'' Norodom Sihanouk.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nSihanouk died of a pulmonary infarction on October 15, 2012.\n\n===Succession to the throne===\nUnlike most monarchies, Cambodia's monarchy is not necessarily [[hereditary monarchy|hereditary]] and the King is not allowed to select his own heir.  Instead, a new King is chosen by a Royal Council of the Throne, consisting of the president of the National Assembly, the Prime Minister, the President of the Senate, the First and Second Vice Presidents of the Senate, the Chiefs of the orders of [[Buddhism in Cambodia#Cambodian adaptations|Mohanikay and Thammayut]], and the First and Second Vice-President of the Assembly.  The Royal Council meets within a week of the King's death or abdication and selects a new King from a pool of candidates with royal blood.\n\nIt has been suggested that Cambodia's ability to peacefully appoint a new King shows that Cambodia's government has stabilized incredibly from the situation the country was in during the 1970s (see [[History of Cambodia]]).\n\n==Executive branch==\n[[File:Hun_Sen_(2016)_cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Hun Sen]] \u2013 [[Prime Minister of Cambodia|Prime Minister]]]]\n[[File:Seal of the Cabinet of Cambodia.svg|thumb|Seal of the Royal Government]]The [[Prime Minister of Cambodia]] is a representative from the ruling party of the National Assembly. He or she is appointed by the King on the recommendation of the President and Vice Presidents of the National Assembly.  In order for a person to become Prime Minister, he or she must first be given a vote of confidence by the National Assembly.\n\nThe Prime Minister is officially the [[Head of Government]] in Cambodia. Upon entry into office, he or she appoints a Council of Ministers who are responsible to the Prime Minister.  Officially, the Prime Minister's duties include chairing meetings of the Council of Ministers (Cambodia's version of a [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]]) and appointing and leading a government. The Prime Minister and his government make up Cambodia's [[executive (government)|executive branch]] of government.\n\nThe current Prime Minister is [[Cambodian People's Party]] (CPP) member [[Hun Sen]].

Two of these members are appointed by the King, two are elected by the lower house of the government, and the remaining fifty-seven are elected popularly by \"functional constituencies.\"  Members in this house serve a six-year term.\n\nThe official duty of the Parliament is to legislate and make laws.  Bills passed by the Parliament are given to the King who gives the proposed bills [[royal assent]].  The King does not have [[veto]] power over bills passed by the National Assembly and thus, cannot withhold royal assent.  The National Assembly also has the power to dismiss the Prime Minister and his government by a two-thirds [[vote of no confidence]].\n\n===Senate===\n\nThe upper house of the Cambodian legislature is called the ''Senate''. It consists of sixty-one members.  Two of these members are appointed by the King, two are elected by the lower house of the government, and the remaining fifty-seven are elected popularly by electors from provincial and local governments, in a similar fashion to the [[Senate of France]]. Members in this house serve six-year terms.\n\nPrior to 2006, elections had last been held for the Senate in 1999. New elections were supposed to have occurred in 2004, but these elections were initially postponed. On January 22, 2006, 11,352 possible voters went to the poll and chose their candidates. This election was criticized by local monitoring non-governmental organizations as being undemocratic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4638406.stm|title=Ruling party wins Cambodia poll|author=|date=19 May 2018|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2006}}, the [[Cambodian People's Party]] holds forty-three seats in the Senate, constituting a significant majority.

It is made up of 125 members, elected by popular vote to serve a five-year term.  Elections were last held for the National Assembly in July 2013.\n\nIn order to vote in legislative elections, one must be at least eighteen years of age. However, in order to be elected to the Legislature, one must be at least twenty-five years of age.\n\nThe National Assembly is led by a President and two Vice Presidents who are selected by Assembly members prior to each session.\n\n{{As of|2018}}, the [[Cambodian People's Party]] holds all 125 seats in the National Assembly.\n\n==Political parties and elections==\n[[File:Sam Rainsy (cropped).jpg|170px|thumb|right|Former opposition leader and CNRP President [[Sam Rainsy]]]]\n[[File:Norodom Ranariddh (2014).jpg|170px|thumb|right|Former First Prime Minister and FUNCINPEC President [[Norodom Ranariddh]]]]\n{{elect|List of political parties in Cambodia|Elections in Cambodia}}\n\n===2018 general election results===\n{{#section-h:2018 Cambodian general election|Results}}\n\n==Judicial branch==\n\nThe [[judiciary|judicial branch]] is independent from the rest of the government, as specified by the Cambodian [[Constitution]]. The highest court of judicial branch is the [[Supreme Council of the Magistracy]]. Other, lower courts also exist. Until 1997, Cambodia did not have a judicial branch of government despite the nation's Constitution requiring one.\n\nThe main duties of the judiciary are to prosecute criminals, settle lawsuits, and, most importantly, protect the freedoms and rights of Cambodian citizens. However, in reality, the judicial branch in Cambodia is highly corrupt and often serves as a tool of the executive branch to silence civil society and its leaders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2006/01/18/cambod12269.htm|title=Essential Background: Overview of human rights issues in Cambodia |website=Human Rights Watch|date=31 December 2005}}</ref> There are currently 17 justices on the Supreme Council.\n\n==International organization participation==\nACCT, [[Asian Development Bank|AsDB]], [[ASEAN]], ESCAP, FAO, G-77, IAEA, IBRD, ICAO, [[International Criminal Court|ICC]], ICRM, IDA, IFAD, IFC, IFRCS, ILO, IMF, IMO, Intelsat (nonsignatory user), [[International Monetary Fund]], Interpol, IOC, ISO (subscriber), ITU, NAM, OPCW, PCA, [[United Nations|UN]], UNCTAD, [[UNESCO]], UNIDO, UPU, [[World Bank|WB]], WFTU, WHO, WIPO, WMO, [[World Trade Organization|WTO]], WToO, WTrO (applicant)\n\n=== International rankings ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It was designed so it could cross churned-up countryside and trenches. A single prototype was built, and followed by an improved model (the [[TOG 2]]), but interest faded with the successful performance of another cross-country design, the [[Churchill tank]], and the mobile war that was being fought.\n\n==History==\nIn July 1939, the Special Vehicle Development Committee was drawn up for future tank designs suitable for [[Great War]] conditions under Sir [[Albert Gerald Stern]]; who had been on the original [[Landship Committee]] and head of the Tank Supply Depot during [[World War I]]. The committee included others who had been instrumental in the development of the tank during the Great War: former [[Director of Naval Construction]], Sir [[Eustace Tennyson d'Eyncourt]], General (retired) Sir [[Ernest Dunlop Swinton|Ernest Swinton]], engine designer [[Harry Ricardo]], the gearbox and transmission expert Major [[Walter Gordon Wilson]]. Unsurprisingly they got the nickname \"The Old Gang\" and the initials TOG were applied to their designs.\n\nTogether, they proposed the development of a ''heavy tank'' design, which they entrusted to another of the first tank's developers and builder of the first tank, Sir [[William Tritton]] of [[William Foster & Co Ltd|Foster's of Lincoln]].\n\nTheir specification was comprehensive. As well as being able to operate across ground broken up by shelling and waterlogged, it was expected to resist 47-mm anti-tank guns and 105-mm field guns or howitzers at {{convert|100|yd|m|abbr=on}}. Main armament would be a field gun mounted in the front - effective against {{convert|7|ft|m|adj=on}} thick reinforced concrete - and two 2-pounder guns, the latter in sponsons. For use against infantry, there would be [[Besa machine gun]]s covering \"all arcs\" - one firing forward, one in each [[sponson]], and one firing to the rear. To provide cover four {{convert|2|in|mm|adj=on}} smoke mortars were included.<ref name=CandE78/><ref>White, p66</ref>\n\nDesign work by Fosters began in December 1939 producing a wooden mock-up. Designed with trench crossing abilities to the fore and the capability to carry infantry as well, the design as built was a large hull with side doors supported on broad tracks, with a 2-pdr-gun-armed [[Matilda II]] infantry tank turret. The front plate of the hull carried the 75&nbsp;mm gun and mounting as used on the French [[Char B1]] tank.<ref>Chamberlain and Ellis p78</ref>\n\nIt was realised that running the track drive over the top of the hull was not necessary and work began on a follow-up design in June 1940. The prototype TOG I was delivered in October 1940. Due to the weight, electrical drive was used - the engine driving two generators connected to an electrical motor for each track. The steering wheel was connected to a [[potentiometer]] that varied the voltage to the track motors. This strained the drive and track. Due to these problems, it was converted to a [[hydraulic]] drive designed by Fluidrive Engineering, a process that took until May 1943 after which it was called TOG 1A. The fluid drive was not satisfactory either.<ref name=CandE78/> The prototype was sent to [[Chobham Common|Chobham]] and then seems to have disappeared into history.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n*White BT, ''British Tanks 1915-1945'' Ian Allan Publishing, London\n* {{Book-Fletcher-Great Tank Scandal}}\n*Chamberlain, P; Ellis, C ''British and American Tanks of World War II'' 1969.

It had a largely Muslim character; similarly, the other principal ethnic groups in Bosnia, the Serbs and Croats, also established ethnically based parties ([[Serb Democratic Party (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|SDS]] and [[Croatian Democratic Union|HDZ]]). The SDA won the largest share of [[1990 Bosnian general election|the vote]], 33% of the seats, with the next runners-up being nationalist ethnic parties representing Serbs and Croats. [[Fikret Abdi\u0107]] won the popular vote for Presidency member among the Bosniak candidates, with 44% of the vote, Izetbegovi\u0107 with 37%. According to the Bosnian constitution, the first two candidates of each of the ''three constitutient nations'' would be elected to a seven-member multi-ethnic rotating presidency (with two Croats, two Serbs, two [[Bosniaks]] and one Yugoslav); a Croat took the post of prime minister and a Serb the presidency of the Assembly. Abdi\u0107 agreed to stand down as the Bosniak candidate for the Presidency and Izetbegovi\u0107 became Chairman of the Presidency. {{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nBosnia's power-sharing arrangements broke down very quickly as ethnic tensions grew after the outbreak of fighting between [[Serbs]] and [[Croats]] in neighboring [[Croatia]]. Although Izetbegovi\u0107 was due to hold the presidency for only one year according to the constitution, this arrangement was initially suspended due to \"extraordinary circumstances\" and was eventually abandoned altogether during the war as the Serb and Croat nationalistic parties SDS and HDZ abandoned the government. When fighting broke out in [[Slovenia]] and Croatia in the summer of 1991, it was immediately apparent that Bosnia would soon become embroiled in the conflict. Izetbegovi\u0107 initially proposed a loose confederation to preserve a unitary Bosnian state and strongly urged a peaceful solution. He did not subscribe to the ''peace at all costs'' view and commented in February 1991 that ''I would sacrifice peace for a sovereign Bosnia-Herzegovina&nbsp;... but for that peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina I would not sacrifice sovereignty.'' He abandoned the [[Zulfikarpa\u0161i\u0107\u2013Karad\u017ei\u0107 agreement]] which would see BiH as a sovereign state in a confederation with Serbia and Montenegro, with 60% of [[Sand\u017eak]] ceded to BiH.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Jasminka Udovicki|author2=James Ridgeway|title=Burn This House: The Making and Unmaking of Yugoslavia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GuGe9fy4raoC&pg=PA204|date=31 October 2000|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-2590-X|pages=204\u2013}}</ref> By the start of 1992 it had become apparent that the rival nationalist demands were fundamentally incompatible: the Bosniaks and Croats sought an independent Bosnia while the Serbs wanted it to remain in a rump Yugoslavia dominated by Serbia.

It did not take effect until 7 April 1992, when the [[European Union]] and United States recognized the new country. Sporadic fighting between Serbs and government forces occurred across Bosnia in the run-up to international recognition. Izetbegovi\u0107 appears to have gambled that the international community would send a peacekeeping force upon recognising Bosnia in order to prevent a war, but this did not happen. Instead, war immediately broke out across the country as Serb and Yugoslav army forces took control of large areas against the poorly-equipped government security forces. Initially, Serb forces attacked the non-Serb civilian population in eastern Bosnia. Once towns and villages were securely in their hands, the Serb forces systematically ransacked or burnt down Bosniak houses and apartments, Bosniak civilians were rounded up or captured, and sometimes beaten or killed in the process. Men and women were separated, with many of the men detained in the camps. The women were kept in various detention centres where they had to live in intolerably unhygienic conditions, including also being raped repeatedly by Serb soldiers or policemen.<ref name=\"ICTY: Kunarac, Kova\u010d and Vukovi\u0107 judgement - Fo\u010da\">{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/icty/kunarac/trialc2/judgement/kun-tj010222e-5.htm#VC |title=ICTY: The attack against the civilian population and related requirements |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219012918/http://un.org/icty/kunarac/trialc2/judgement/kun-tj010222e-5.htm |archivedate=19 February 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIzetbegovi\u0107 consistently promoted the idea of a multi-ethnic Bosnia under central control, which seemed a hopeless strategy under the circumstances. The Bosnian Croats, disillusioned with the Sarajevo government and supported militarily and financially by the Croatian government, increasingly turned to establishing their own ethnically-based state of ''[[Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia]]'' in [[Herzegovina]] and Central Bosnia. The Croats pulled out of the Sarajevo government and [[Croat\u2013Bosniak War|fighting broke out in 1993]]. In some areas local armistices were signed between the Serbs and Croats.

However, the foreign volunteers became unpopular even with many of the Bosniak population, because the [[Army of Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian army]] had thousands of troops and no need for more soldiers, but for arms. Many Bosnian army officers and intellectuals were suspicious regarding foreign volunteers arrival in central part of the country, because they came from [[Split (city)|Split]] and [[Zagreb]] in Croatia, and were passed through the self-proclaimed Herzeg-Bosnia unlike Bosnian army soldiers who were regularly arrested by Croat forces. According to general [[Stjepan \u0160iber]], the highest ranking ethnic Croat in the Bosnian army, the key role in foreign volunteers arrival was played by [[Franjo Tu\u0111man]] and Croatian [[counter-intelligence]] underground with the aim to justify the involvement of Croatia in the Bosnian War and mass crimes committed by Croat forces.

The war between the Bosniaks and Croats was eventually ended by a truce brokered with the aid of the Americans in March 1994, following which the two sides collaborated more closely against the Serbs. [[NATO]] then became increasingly involved in the conflict with occasional \"pinprick\" bombings conducted against the Bosnian Serbs, generally following violations of ceasefires and the no-fly zone over Bosnia. The Bosnian Croat forces benefited indirectly from US military training given to the Croatian Army. In addition, the Croatians provided considerable quantities of weaponry to the Bosnian Croats and much smaller amounts to the Bosnian army, despite a UN weapons [[embargo]]. Most of the Bosnian army's supply of weapons was airlifted from the Muslim world, specifically Iran \u2013 an issue which became the subject of some controversy and a US congressional investigation in 1996.

The offensive came to a halt not far from the [[de facto]] Serb capital of [[Banja Luka]]. \n\nWhen the Croat and Bosniak forces stopped their advance they had captured the power plants supplying Banja Luka's electricity and used that control to pressure the Serb leadership into accepting a ceasefire.

The following May, the Bosnian Supreme Court conceded the point with an announcement that \"some of the actions of the accused did not have the characteristics of criminal acts\" and reduced Izetbegovi\u0107's sentence to twelve years.

It had a largely Muslim character; similarly, the other principal ethnic groups in Bosnia, the Serbs and Croats, also established ethnically based parties ([[Serb Democratic Party (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|SDS]] and [[Croatian Democratic Union|HDZ]]). The SDA won the largest share of [[1990 Bosnian general election|the vote]], 33% of the seats, with the next runners-up being nationalist ethnic parties representing Serbs and Croats. [[Fikret Abdi\u0107]] won the popular vote for Presidency member among the Bosniak candidates, with 44% of the vote, Izetbegovi\u0107 with 37%. According to the Bosnian constitution, the first two candidates of each of the ''three constitutient nations'' would be elected to a seven-member multi-ethnic rotating presidency (with two Croats, two Serbs, two [[Bosniaks]] and one Yugoslav); a Croat took the post of prime minister and a Serb the presidency of the Assembly. Abdi\u0107 agreed to stand down as the Bosniak candidate for the Presidency and Izetbegovi\u0107 became Chairman of the Presidency. {{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nBosnia's power-sharing arrangements broke down very quickly as ethnic tensions grew after the outbreak of fighting between [[Serbs]] and [[Croats]] in neighboring [[Croatia]]. Although Izetbegovi\u0107 was due to hold the presidency for only one year according to the constitution, this arrangement was initially suspended due to \"extraordinary circumstances\" and was eventually abandoned altogether during the war as the Serb and Croat nationalistic parties SDS and HDZ abandoned the government. When fighting broke out in [[Slovenia]] and Croatia in the summer of 1991, it was immediately apparent that Bosnia would soon become embroiled in the conflict. Izetbegovi\u0107 initially proposed a loose confederation to preserve a unitary Bosnian state and strongly urged a peaceful solution. He did not subscribe to the ''peace at all costs'' view and commented in February 1991 that ''I would sacrifice peace for a sovereign Bosnia-Herzegovina&nbsp;... but for that peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina I would not sacrifice sovereignty.'' He abandoned the [[Zulfikarpa\u0161i\u0107\u2013Karad\u017ei\u0107 agreement]] which would see BiH as a sovereign state in a confederation with Serbia and Montenegro, with 60% of [[Sand\u017eak]] ceded to BiH.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Jasminka Udovicki|author2=James Ridgeway|title=Burn This House: The Making and Unmaking of Yugoslavia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GuGe9fy4raoC&pg=PA204|date=31 October 2000|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-2590-X|pages=204\u2013}}</ref> By the start of 1992 it had become apparent that the rival nationalist demands were fundamentally incompatible: the Bosniaks and Croats sought an independent Bosnia while the Serbs wanted it to remain in a rump Yugoslavia dominated by Serbia. Izetbegovi\u0107 publicly complained that he was being forced to ally with one side or the other, vividly characterising the dilemma by comparing it to having to choose between [[leukaemia]] and a brain tumour.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=LZMp9ZfGfMUC&pg=PA174&dq=Izetbegovic+leukaemia+and+a+brain+tumour ''After the Peace'' by Robert L.

Initially, all three sides signed up to the agreement; Izetbegovi\u0107 for the Bosniaks, [[Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107]] for the Serbs and [[Mate Boban]] for the Croats. Some two weeks later, however, Izetbegovi\u0107 withdrew his signature and declared his opposition to any type of [[partition of Bosnia]], supposedly encouraged by [[Warren Zimmermann]], the [[United States Ambassador to Yugoslavia]] at the time.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/29/world/us-policymakers-on-bosnia-admit-errors-in-opposing-partition-in-1992.html|title=U.S. Policymakers on Bosnia Admit Errors in Opposing Partition in 1992|last=Binder|first=David|date=1993-08-29|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2017-02-04}}</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=es267LuAcAA YouTube]</ref>\n\n==Bosnian War==\n{{Main|Bosnian War}}\nIn February 1992, Izetbegovi\u0107 called an [[independence referendum]] on the European condition{{sfn|Burg|Shoup|2000|p=99}} for recognition of Bosnia and Herzegovina as an independent state, despite warnings from the Serb members of the presidency that it was unconstitutional{{sfn|Lauterpacht|Greenwood|1999|pp=140\u2013141}} and that any move towards independence would result in the [[Serb Autonomous Regions|Serb-inhabited areas]] seceding to remain with the [[Serbia and Montenegro|rump Yugoslavia]].

It did not take effect until 7 April 1992, when the [[European Union]] and United States recognized the new country. Sporadic fighting between Serbs and government forces occurred across Bosnia in the run-up to international recognition. Izetbegovi\u0107 appears to have gambled that the international community would send a peacekeeping force upon recognising Bosnia in order to prevent a war, but this did not happen. Instead, war immediately broke out across the country as Serb and Yugoslav army forces took control of large areas against the poorly-equipped government security forces. Initially, Serb forces attacked the non-Serb civilian population in eastern Bosnia. Once towns and villages were securely in their hands, the Serb forces systematically ransacked or burnt down Bosniak houses and apartments, Bosniak civilians were rounded up or captured, and sometimes beaten or killed in the process. Men and women were separated, with many of the men detained in the camps. The women were kept in various detention centres where they had to live in intolerably unhygienic conditions, including also being raped repeatedly by Serb soldiers or policemen.<ref name=\"ICTY: Kunarac, Kova\u010d and Vukovi\u0107 judgement - Fo\u010da\">{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/icty/kunarac/trialc2/judgement/kun-tj010222e-5.htm#VC |title=ICTY: The attack against the civilian population and related requirements |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219012918/http://un.org/icty/kunarac/trialc2/judgement/kun-tj010222e-5.htm |archivedate=19 February 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIzetbegovi\u0107 consistently promoted the idea of a multi-ethnic Bosnia under central control, which seemed a hopeless strategy under the circumstances. The Bosnian Croats, disillusioned with the Sarajevo government and supported militarily and financially by the Croatian government, increasingly turned to establishing their own ethnically-based state of ''[[Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia]]'' in [[Herzegovina]] and Central Bosnia. The Croats pulled out of the Sarajevo government and [[Croat\u2013Bosniak War|fighting broke out in 1993]]. In some areas local armistices were signed between the Serbs and Croats. Croat forces launched their first attacks on Bosniaks in central Bosnia in June 1992, but these failed.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} The [[Graz agreement]] caused deep division among Bosnian Croats and strengthened separatist Herzeg-Bosnia, and led to the [[La\u0161va Valley ethnic cleansing]] campaign against Bosniak civilians from May 1992 to March 1993.<ref name=\"ICTY: Bla\u0161ki\u0107 verdict - A.

Abdi\u0107's faction was eventually routed by the Bosnian army. By this time, Izetbegovi\u0107's government controlled only about 25% of the country and represented principally the Bosniak community. {{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nFor three and a half years, Izetbegovi\u0107 lived precariously in a [[Siege of Sarajevo|besieged Sarajevo]] surrounded by Serb forces. He denounced the failure of Western countries to reverse Serb ''aggression'' and turned instead to the Muslim world, with which he had already established relations during his days as a dissident. The Bosnian government received money and arms. Following massacres on Bosnian Muslims by Serb and, to a lesser extent, Croat forces, foreign Muslim volunteers joined the Bosnian army in the so-called [[Bosnian mujahideen]], numbering between 300 and 1,500.<ref name=\"SENSE tribunal\">SENSE Tribunal:ICTY \u2013 WE FOUGHT WITH THE BH ARMY, BUT NOT UNDER ITS COMMAND {{cite web|url=http://www.sense-agency.com/en/stream.php?sta%3D3%26pid%3D10225%26kat%3D3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214215330/http://www.sense-agency.com/en/stream.php?sta=3&pid=10225&kat=3 |archivedate=14 December 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref> They quickly attracted heavy criticism amplified by Serb and Croat propaganda, who considered their presence to be evidence of ''violent Islamic fundamentalism'' at the heart of Europe. However, the foreign volunteers became unpopular even with many of the Bosniak population, because the [[Army of Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian army]] had thousands of troops and no need for more soldiers, but for arms. Many Bosnian army officers and intellectuals were suspicious regarding foreign volunteers arrival in central part of the country, because they came from [[Split (city)|Split]] and [[Zagreb]] in Croatia, and were passed through the self-proclaimed Herzeg-Bosnia unlike Bosnian army soldiers who were regularly arrested by Croat forces. According to general [[Stjepan \u0160iber]], the highest ranking ethnic Croat in the Bosnian army, the key role in foreign volunteers arrival was played by [[Franjo Tu\u0111man]] and Croatian [[counter-intelligence]] underground with the aim to justify the involvement of Croatia in the Bosnian War and mass crimes committed by Croat forces. Although Izetbegovi\u0107 regarded them as symbolically valuable as a sign of the Muslim world's support for Bosnia, they appear to have made little military difference and became a major political liability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.islam.co.ba/razmisljanja/index.php?subaction=ostalo&id=1070747643|archive-url=https://archive.is/20121208130905/http://www.islam.co.ba/razmisljanja/index.php?subaction=ostalo&id=1070747643|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-12-08|title=Predrag Matvejevi\u0107 analysis}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, Izetbegovi\u0107 agreed to a peace plan that would divide Bosnia along ethnic lines but continued to insist on a unitary Bosnia government from Sarajevo and on the allocation to the Bosniaks of a large percentage of Bosnia's territory. The war between the Bosniaks and Croats was eventually ended by a truce brokered with the aid of the Americans in March 1994, following which the two sides collaborated more closely against the Serbs. [[NATO]] then became increasingly involved in the conflict with occasional \"pinprick\" bombings conducted against the Bosnian Serbs, generally following violations of ceasefires and the no-fly zone over Bosnia. The Bosnian Croat forces benefited indirectly from US military training given to the Croatian Army. In addition, the Croatians provided considerable quantities of weaponry to the Bosnian Croats and much smaller amounts to the Bosnian army, despite a UN weapons [[embargo]]. Most of the Bosnian army's supply of weapons was airlifted from the Muslim world, specifically Iran \u2013 an issue which became the subject of some controversy and a US congressional investigation in 1996. In September 1993, the Second Bosniak Congress officially re-introduced the historical ethnic name Bosniaks.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} The Yugoslav \"[[Muslims (ethnic group)|Muslims by nationality]]\" policy was considered by Bosniaks to be neglecting and opposing their Bosnian identity because the term tried to describe Bosniaks as a religious group not an ethnic one.<ref name=\"Imamovic\">Historija Bo\u0161njaka by Mustafa Imamovi\u0107 (1996), Sarajevo: BZK Preporod; {{ISBN|9958-815-00-1}}</ref>\n\n===Ending the war===\n[[File:DaytonAgreement.jpg|thumb|[[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]], Alija Izetbegovi\u0107, and [[Franjo Tu\u0111man]] initialling the [[Dayton Agreement]] at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio on 21 November 1995]]\nThe [[Washington Agreement]] in March 1994 ended the [[Croat-Bosniak War]] and divided the combined [[Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|ARBiH]] and [[Croatian Defence Council|HVO]] territory into ten autonomous cantons, establishing the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]].\n\nIn August 1995, following the [[Srebrenica massacre]] and the [[Markale massacres#Second massacre|2nd Markale massacre]], [[NATO]] launched an [[1995 NATO bombing campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina|intensive bombing campaign]] which destroyed Bosnian Serb command and control system. This allowed the Croatian and Bosniak forces to overrun many Serb-held areas of the country, producing a roughly 50/50 split of the territory between the two sides. The offensive came to a halt not far from the [[de facto]] Serb capital of [[Banja Luka]]. \n\nWhen the Croat and Bosniak forces stopped their advance they had captured the power plants supplying Banja Luka's electricity and used that control to pressure the Serb leadership into accepting a ceasefire. The parties agreed to meet at [[Dayton, Ohio]] to negotiate a peace treaty under the supervision of the United States.

Purple won and was featured for a limited time. To help the colors get votes, [[Ken Schrader]] and his [[MB2 Motorsports]] team, who was sponsored by M&M's at the time, ran four paint schemes during the [[2002 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|2002 NASCAR Winston Cup Series season]] representing the promotion (one for aqua, one for pink, one for purple, and another one with all three colors on the car). Specially marked packages of M&M's were released in Japan. Finding a bag of all purple M&M's entitled the customer to a prize of 100 million [[Japanese Yen|yen]] (equivalent to approximately USD $852,000).\n\nOn January 1, 2004, at the stroke of midnight, Mars removed all of the colors of M&M's and made them black-and-white on both their candies and the packaging. It coincided with a commercial parodying ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' where [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]] is home in bed and looks out of the window and sees what the colors of the four M&M's were. The goal was to help the M&M's find their colors in black-and-white packages of M&M's, in this order: brown, orange, red, green, yellow, and blue.

Consumers could vote by calling 1-800-FUN-COLOR. Ads for the new blue colors featured a plain and an almond blue M&M character as Red and Yellow take notice of trying to do takes in the commercial by painting themselves blue where they appear on stage with [[B.B. King]] singing the blues, but the filmmakers had to cut the scene as they were not the real blue M&M's; another featured Red and Yellow holding their breath to look like the new blue M&M's, where [[Steven Weber (actor)|Steven Weber]] sees the three M&M's, Red, Yellow, and Blue; and one more featuring Weber talking to the blue M&M if he had dived into the chocolate pool, but did not.\n\nIn 2002, Mars solicited votes in their first ever \"M&M's Global Color Vote\" to add a new color from three choices: [[aqua (color)|aqua]] ([[turquoise (color)|turquoise]]), [[pink]], and [[purple]]. Purple won and was featured for a limited time. To help the colors get votes, [[Ken Schrader]] and his [[MB2 Motorsports]] team, who was sponsored by M&M's at the time, ran four paint schemes during the [[2002 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|2002 NASCAR Winston Cup Series season]] representing the promotion (one for aqua, one for pink, one for purple, and another one with all three colors on the car). Specially marked packages of M&M's were released in Japan. Finding a bag of all purple M&M's entitled the customer to a prize of 100 million [[Japanese Yen|yen]] (equivalent to approximately USD $852,000).\n\nOn January 1, 2004, at the stroke of midnight, Mars removed all of the colors of M&M's and made them black-and-white on both their candies and the packaging. It coincided with a commercial parodying ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' where [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]] is home in bed and looks out of the window and sees what the colors of the four M&M's were. The goal was to help the M&M's find their colors in black-and-white packages of M&M's, in this order: brown, orange, red, green, yellow, and blue. After all of the colors have been found, the colored packaging returned, and began carrying the theme \"Chocolate is better in color\".{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nSince 2004, M&M's have been available online in 17 colors, with personalized phrases on each candy on the opposite side from the \"m\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mymms.com/|title=Custom Printed MY M&M'S|work=mms.com|publisher=[[Mars, Incorporated]]|accessdate=February 6, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211174015/http://www.mymms.com/|archive-date=February 11, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Released around Christmas, these custom-printed M&M's were originally intended for [[holiday greetings]], but are now available all year round.\n\nFor the 2008 [[Valentine's Day]] season, Mars introduced all-green bags of M&M's. This was due to common [[Urban legend|urban folklore]] that says green M&M's are an [[aphrodisiac]].<ref>{{cite news|title=M&M'S Chocolate Candies go green just in time for Valentine's Day|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/mnr/mars/31278/|publisher=PRNewswire|date=January 16, 2008|accessdate=August 14, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913095216/http://www.prnewswire.com/mnr/mars/31278/|archive-date=September 13, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> They were brought back for 2009 alongside the \"Ms. Green Heats Up Valentine's Day\" contest.\n\nIn October 2011, Mars released M&M's [[White Chocolate]] [[Candy Corn]] exclusively in the United States for [[Halloween]]. These candies come in three candy corn inspired colors: white, bright yellow, and bright orange.\n\nThe following is a summary of the changes to the colors of the flagship ([[milk chocolate]]) flavor of M&M's, the only filling manufactured continuously since the beginning of the brand.  From 1941 until 1969, each package contained M&M's in five different colors; when red M&M's were reintroduced in 1987, they were added as a sixth color instead of replacing any of the existing colors.\n<div class=\"center\">\n<timeline>\nImageSize = width:800 height:200\nPlotArea = left:50 bottom:60 top:0 right:50\nAlignbars = justify\nDateFormat  = yyyy\nPeriod = from:1940 till:2018\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\n\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:5 start:1940\n\nColors =\n  id:brown   value:rgb(0.32, 0.20, 0.18)\n  id:tan     value:rgb(0.57, 0.44, 0.22)\n  id:red     value:rgb(0.86, 0.08, 0.16)\n  id:orange  value:rgb(0.98, 0.30, 0)\n  id:yellow  value:rgb(0.95, 0.95, 0.05)\n  id:green   value:rgb(0.20, 0.70, 0.34)\n  id:blue    value:rgb(0.05, 0.15, 0.85)\n  id:violet  value:rgb(0.55, 0.27, 0.55)\n  id:purple  value:rgb(0.35, 0.25, 0.35)\nLineData =\n  at:1945 color:black layer:back\n  at:1955 color:black layer:back\n  at:1965 color:black layer:back\n  at:1975 color:black layer:back\n  at:1985 color:black layer:back\n  at:1995 color:black layer:back\n  at:2005 color:black layer:back\n\nBarData =\n  bar:mmbrown  text:\"Brown\"\n  bar:mmyellow text:\"Yellow\"\n  bar:mmgreen  text:\"Green\"\n  bar:mmred1   text:\"Red\"\n  bar:mmorange text:\"Orange\"\n  bar:mmviolet text:\"Violet\"\n  bar:mmtan    text:\"Tan\"\n  bar:mmblue   text:\"Blue\"\n\nPlotData =\n  width:10 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(10,-4)\n  bar:mmbrown  from:1941 till:end color:brown\n  bar:mmyellow from:1941 till:end color:yellow\n  bar:mmgreen  from:1941 till:end color:green\n  bar:mmviolet from:1941 till:1949 color:violet\n  bar:mmred1   from:1941 till:1976 color:red\n  bar:mmred1   from:1987 till:end color:red\n  bar:mmtan    from:1949 till:1995 color:tan\n  bar:mmorange from:1976 till:end color:orange\n  bar:mmblue   from:1995 till:end color:blue</timeline> 1940\u2012present\n</div>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|United States}}\n* Similar candies from other companies:\n** [[Smarties]]\n** [[Cadbury]] Gems\n** [[Reese's Pieces]]\n** [[Sixlets]]\n** [[Freia (chocolate)|Freia's]] Non Stop\n** [[List of products manufactured by The Hershey Company#Miscellaneous products|Hershey-ets]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|M&M's}}\n*[http://www.mms.com/ Official website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080910125635/http://us.mms.com/us/about/mmshistory/ The History of M&M's Chocolates] from us.mms.com\n\n{{Mars brands}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:MandM's}}\n[[Category:Mars confectionery brands]]\n[[Category:Candy]]\n", "name_user": "Kind Tennis Fan", "label": "safe", "comment": "Minor edit.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%26M%27s"}

Following the result of Inter, Juventus lost its game against [[Trieste]] and not won the game of Liguria. So, Ambrosiana remained over top in the last round with 39 points, followed by Juventus with 38 and Bologna. The squad clinched the title on final round, winning the match of [[Bari]]. \n\nWhen Ambrosiana beat Bari, Meazza scored five goals in a 9\u20132 victory<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/static/speciale/2010/sudafrica/nazionale/record.html|title=Record e Curiosit\u00e0|trans-title=Records and Trivia|publisher=La Repubblica|language=Italian|accessdate=6 May 2016}}</ref>.

Moody|Ivan Moody]] and guitarist John Stevens met at [[XM Radio]]. Ivan's band [[Motograter]], previously signed to [[Elektra Records]], were to perform live on-air, when John, an XM Radio producer, impressed with Ivan's vocals, thought he would be a good fit with the material he had written for his previous project.\n\nAfter several recording sessions, drummer Chris Binns of Motograter (Formally of Intrinsic) was recruited, along with electronics/keyboards/programmer Brett Davis and finally bassist Mike McLaughlin (Formally of Intrinsic).\n\nThe band released their self-titled debut album ''[[Ghost Machine (album)|Ghost Machine]]'' on July 26, 2005 via their own label Black Blood Records. The album was engineered and co-produced by Pete Murray ([[Lo-Pro]]).\n\nOn December 21, 2005, the band signed with [[independent label]], [[Corporate Punishment Records]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.corporatepunishment.com/news/page/12/ |title=Corporate Punishment Records |accessdate=21 December 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117123702/http://www.corporatepunishment.com/news/page/12/ |archivedate=17 January 2010 }}</ref>\n\nThe band's second album ''[[Hypersensitive]]'' was released on November 21, 2006.

When asked if he was going to work with Ghost Machine again, Ivan Moody said: \"I don't. Ghost Machine was something I did for fun. Lots of good friends involved.
