Black slaves were attendants to sea captains and ex-colonial officials, as well as traders, plantation owners and military personnel. This caused an increasing black presence in the northern, eastern, and southern areas of London. One of the most famous slaves to attend a sea captain was known as [[Sambo's Grave|Sambo]]. He fell ill shortly after arriving in England and was consequently buried in Lancashire. His plaque and gravestone still stand to this day.

At the time, there was no anti-discrimination legislation to prevent landlords from refusing to accept black tenants. A survey undertaken in [[Birmingham]] in 1956 found that only 15 of a total of 1,000 white people surveyed would let a room to a black tenant.

For many Caribbean immigrants, their first experience of discrimination came when trying to find private accommodation. They were generally ineligible for [[council housing]] because only people who had been resident in the UK for a minimum of five years qualified for it. At the time, there was no anti-discrimination legislation to prevent landlords from refusing to accept black tenants. A survey undertaken in [[Birmingham]] in 1956 found that only 15 of a total of 1,000 white people surveyed would let a room to a black tenant. As a result, many black immigrants were forced to live in [[slum]] areas of cities, where the housing was of poor quality and there were problems of crime, violence and prostitution.<ref name=Cloake>{{cite book|title=Multicultural Britain|first1=J.

Academic Robert Ford demonstrates that [[social distance]], measured using questions from the [[British Social Attitudes]] survey about whether people would mind having an ethnic minority boss or have a close relative marry an ethnic minority spouse, declined over the period 1983\u20131996.

The project also notes that the British school system \"has been indicted on numerous occasions for racism, and for undermining the self-confidence of black children and maligning the culture of their parents\". The MAR profile on African-Caribbeans in the United Kingdom notes \"growing 'black on black' violence between people from the Caribbean and immigrants from Africa\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/mar/assessment.asp?groupId=20005|title=Assessment for Afro-Caribbeans in the United Kingdom|publisher=Minorities At Risk Project, University of Maryland|date=31 December 2006|accessdate=28 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141122000240/http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/mar/assessment.asp?groupId=20005|archivedate=22 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThere is concern that murders using knives are given insufficient attention because most victims are black.

Archaeological evidence supports the existence of human settlement in the region around 1500 BC. The islands have long been known to sailors, as indicated by an anonymous reference from the first century AD to the region in [[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]. The islands were also mentioned in the Buddhist [[Jataka tales|Jataka stories]] of the sixth century BC. [[Islam]] was established in the region when Muslims arrived around the seventh century. During the medieval period, the region was ruled by the [[Chola dynasty]] and [[Kolathunadu|Kingdom of Cannanore]]. The [[Catholicism|Catholic]] [[Portuguese India|Portuguese]] arrived around 1498 but were expelled by 1545. The region was then ruled by the Muslim house of [[Arakkal kingdom|Arakkal]], followed by [[Tipu Sultan]]. On his death in 1799, most of the region passed on to the [[British Raj|British]] and with their departure, the Union Territory was formed in 1956.\n\nTen of the islands are inhabited. At the [[2011 Indian census]], the population of the Union Territory was 64,473. The majority of the indigenous population is Muslim and most of them belong to the [[Shafi'i|Shafi school]] of the Sunni sect. The islanders are ethnically similar to the [[Malayali]] people of the nearest [[Indian state]] of [[Kerala]]. Most of the population speaks [[Malayalam]] with [[Maldivian language|Mahi (or Mahl)]] being the most spoken language in [[Minicoy]] island. The islands are served by an [[Agatti Aerodrome|airport]] on [[Agatti Island]]. The main occupation of the people is [[fishing]] and coconut cultivation, with [[tuna]] being the main item of export.\n\n==History==\nOne of the earliest references to the region is by an anonymous author in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea.<ref name=thefreelibrary>{{cite web|title=Marine investigations in the Lakshadweep Islands, India.|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Marine+investigations+in+the+Lakshadweep+Islands,+India.-a065537229|publisher=thefreelibrary.com|accessdate=1 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927040024/http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Marine+investigations+in+the+Lakshadweep+Islands,+India.-a065537229|archive-date=27 September 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> There are references to the control of the islands by the [[Chera Dynasty|Cheras]] in the [[Sangam literature|Sangam]] ''[[Pati\u1e5f\u1e5fuppattu]]''.

Archaeological evidence supports the existence of human settlement in the region around 1500 BC. The islands have long been known to sailors, as indicated by an anonymous reference from the first century AD to the region in [[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]. The islands were also mentioned in the Buddhist [[Jataka tales|Jataka stories]] of the sixth century BC. [[Islam]] was established in the region when Muslims arrived around the seventh century. During the medieval period, the region was ruled by the [[Chola dynasty]] and [[Kolathunadu|Kingdom of Cannanore]]. The [[Catholicism|Catholic]] [[Portuguese India|Portuguese]] arrived around 1498 but were expelled by 1545. The region was then ruled by the Muslim house of [[Arakkal kingdom|Arakkal]], followed by [[Tipu Sultan]]. On his death in 1799, most of the region passed on to the [[British Raj|British]] and with their departure, the Union Territory was formed in 1956.\n\nTen of the islands are inhabited. At the [[2011 Indian census]], the population of the Union Territory was 64,473. The majority of the indigenous population is Muslim and most of them belong to the [[Shafi'i|Shafi school]] of the Sunni sect. The islanders are ethnically similar to the [[Malayali]] people of the nearest [[Indian state]] of [[Kerala]]. Most of the population speaks [[Malayalam]] with [[Maldivian language|Mahi (or Mahl)]] being the most spoken language in [[Minicoy]] island. The islands are served by an [[Agatti Aerodrome|airport]] on [[Agatti Island]]. The main occupation of the people is [[fishing]] and coconut cultivation, with [[tuna]] being the main item of export.\n\n==History==\nOne of the earliest references to the region is by an anonymous author in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea.<ref name=thefreelibrary>{{cite web|title=Marine investigations in the Lakshadweep Islands, India.|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Marine+investigations+in+the+Lakshadweep+Islands,+India.-a065537229|publisher=thefreelibrary.com|accessdate=1 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927040024/http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Marine+investigations+in+the+Lakshadweep+Islands,+India.-a065537229|archive-date=27 September 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> There are references to the control of the islands by the [[Chera Dynasty|Cheras]] in the [[Sangam literature|Sangam]] ''[[Pati\u1e5f\u1e5fuppattu]]''.
