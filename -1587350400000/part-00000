However, his performance in [[Sooraj R. Barjatya]]'s romantic dramedy ''[[Main Prem Ki Diwani Hoon]]'' (2003) earned him his first nomination for the [[Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor]], and he went on to win the award the following year for his performance in [[Mani Ratnam]]'s political drama ''[[Yuva]]'' (2004).\n\n=== 2004\u20132009 ===\n{{BLP sources section|date=December 2019}}\nBachchan better established himself in [[Hindi cinema]] playing a no-nonsense [[Mumbai Police|Mumbai police officer]] in the blockbuster [[action film|action]] [[Thriller film|thriller]] ''[[Dhoom]]'' (2004), which also starred [[Uday Chopra]], [[John Abraham (actor)|John Abraham]], [[Esha Deol]], and [[Rimi Sen]] in pivotal roles.

However, his performance in [[Sooraj R. Barjatya]]'s romantic dramedy ''[[Main Prem Ki Diwani Hoon]]'' (2003) earned him his first nomination for the [[Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor]], and he went on to win the award the following year for his performance in [[Mani Ratnam]]'s political drama ''[[Yuva]]'' (2004).\n\n=== 2004\u20132009 ===\n{{BLP sources section|date=December 2019}}\nBachchan better established himself in [[Hindi cinema]] playing a no-nonsense [[Mumbai Police|Mumbai police officer]] in the blockbuster [[action film|action]] [[Thriller film|thriller]] ''[[Dhoom]]'' (2004), which also starred [[Uday Chopra]], [[John Abraham (actor)|John Abraham]], [[Esha Deol]], and [[Rimi Sen]] in pivotal roles. His next two films were ''[[Phir Milenge]]'' (2004) and ''[[Naach (2004 film)|Naach]]'' (2004).\n\nBachchan's first release of 2005 was the crime comedy ''[[Bunty Aur Babli]]'', which featured him and [[Rani Mukerji]] as the titular con artist duo who perform several successful heists and fall in love along the way. The film emerged as the second highest-grossing [[Bollywood films of 2005|Bollywood film of 2005]], and earned him a nomination for the [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor]]. This film also marked his first professional collaboration with his father [[Amitabh Bachchan]], who played a police officer closely following the lead pair.\n\nBachchan was next seen in [[Ram Gopal Varma]]'s political drama ''[[Sarkar (2005 film)|Sarkar]]'', which was a moderate success at the box office.

Bachchan played the role of a man whose wife ([[Rani Mukerji]]) is unhappy with their marriage, and so begins an affair with a friend ([[Shah Rukh Khan]]) who is also unhappy with his marriage to his wife ([[Preity Zinta]]).\n\nBachchan then starred opposite [[Aishwarya Rai]] in the period romance ''[[Umrao Jaan (2006 film)|Umrao Jaan]]'', a remake of the [[Umrao Jaan (1981 film)|1981 film of the same name]] starring [[Rekha]] and [[Farooq Sheikh]] in the lead roles.
