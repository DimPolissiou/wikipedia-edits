He sums up his theories in his 2005 article, \"Trust in Cyberspace\".<ref name=ref2>{{cite web|url=https://ctools.umich.edu/access/content/group/aaaaaee7-1694-481e-95b6-090bdec54ec2/Required%20Readings/3%20Virtual%20Environments/Weckert%20Trust%20in%20Cyberspace%202005.pdf|title=Trust in Cyberspace}}</ref>\n\nIn the article, Weckert focuses on a few key issues regarding the concept of trust and if and when it may be possible in cyberspace. Trust has both cognitive and non-cognitive aspects: one may feel a certain way about another's trustworthiness without believing it in their mind. Trust opens one up to a degree of risk and is thus indispensable to friendship. Weckert opposes trust with monitoring by arguing that in order for trust to exist there must be limits on monitoring. He argues that a lack of community values or online social norms makes the internet less trustworthy but this obstacle may dissipate over time. He also addresses the hurdles that online anonymity and disembodiment put in front of online trust.\n\nIn terms of the effect trust has on the average person (or digital representation of a person) in an online environment, Weckert's ideas apply similarly.  He assesses some factors relevant to video gaming, where trust is often an issue, specifically when playing against human opponents.  In his 2005 article, he specifies some methods for obtaining online trust, and his second method focuses on how to do so in the context of e-commerce.  Near the end he mentions that developing trust in areas such as chat groups is not as much of a problem because not as much is at stake.<ref name=ref2/>  This is also true in some cases with respect to online gaming.  While gaming certainly does not place as much at stake as a financial transaction, players sometimes have a very strong connection to the game or some part of the game such as their avatar, and for this reason trust is an important factor for them within the game.\n\n===Trust in relation to cheating===\n\nWeckert's work with online trust also has significant implications on [[cheating]].  Due to the increased sense of community and closeness associated with the establishment of trust in an online environment, occurrences of cheating are likely to decline.  In Mia Consalvo's 2007 article on gaining advantages in video games, she states that one sense of cheating can be defined as \"violating the spirit of the game.\"<ref name=ref4>{{cite web|url=https://ctools.umich.edu/access/content/group/aaaaaee7-1694-481e-95b6-090bdec54ec2/Required%20Readings/3%20Virtual%20Environments/Consalvo%20Gaining%20Advantage%202007.pdf|last=Consalvo|first=Mia|title=Gaining Advantage in Videogames|year=2007}}</ref> The \"spirit of the game\" is less likely to be violated if each player in the virtual world has some type of trust that the others will respect the game in at least a similar sense to their own.  By definition, the spirit of the game would not be violated by the players (or at least minimally violated), therefore by definition this would mean that cheating would at least decline.\n\n===Other contributions===\nIn addition to his work related to trust, Weckert has contributed to many other areas within Information and Computer Ethics.  Recently, he has begun research on the application of the precautionary principle to nanotechnology.  This research involves a careful analysis of the real and potential risks of developments in nanotechnology, as well as an examination of just what the precautionary principle is.\n\n==Publications==\nWeckert has published both books and scholarly journal entries.  This is an abridged version of the list of his work, as he has contributed to many other publications including guest editorships, book chapters, conferences, talks, and professional magazines.<ref name=ref3>{{cite web|url=http://www.cappe.edu.au/docs/staff-cvs/weckert.pdf|title=John Weckert's curriculum vittae}}</ref>\n\n===Articles===\n* {{cite journal|first=John|last=Weckert|title=Giving and taking offence in a global context|journal=International Journal of Technology and Human Interaction|year=2007}}\n* {{cite journal|first=John|last=Weckert|first2=James|last2=Moor|title=The precautionary principle in nanotechnology|journal=International Journal of Applied Philosophy|volume=20|year=2006|pages=191\u2013204|doi=10.5840/ijap200620214}}\n* {{cite journal|first=John|last=Weckert|first2=Barney|last2=Dalgarno|title=Child pornography and deception on the Internet: some ethical considerations|journal=Information, Communication and Ethics in Society|volume=4|year=2006|pages=173\u2013182}}\n* {{cite journal|first=Mike|last=Bowern|first2=Oliver|last2=Burmeister|first3=Don|last3=Gotterbarn|first4=John|last4=Weckert|title=ICT integrity: bringing the ACS Code of Ethics up to date|journal=Australian Journal of Information Systems|volume=13|year=2006|pages=169\u2013181|doi=10.3127/ajis.v13i2.50}}\n* {{cite journal|first=Stuart|last=Ferguson|first2=Rachel|last2=Salmond|first3=Yeslam|last3=Al-Saggaf|first4=Mike|last4=Bowern|first5=John|last5=Weckert|title=The use of case studies in professional codes of Ethics: The relevance of the ACS experience to ALIA\u2019s Code of Ethics|journal=Australian Library Journal|volume=54|year=2005}}\n* {{cite journal|first=Oliver K.|last=Burmeister|first2=John|last2=Weckert|title=Applying the new Software Engineering Code of Ethics to Usability Engineering|journal=Journal of Information, Communications and Ethics in Society|year=2003|pages=119\u2013132}}\n* {{cite journal|first=John|last=Weckert|first2=Yeslam|last2=Al-Saggaf|title=Online Cultural Imperialism: Is it an Ethical Issue?|journal=Journal of Information, Communication and Ethics in Society|volume=1|number=1|year=2003|pages=21\u201329|doi=10.1108/14779960380000223}}\n* {{cite journal|first=Archie L.|last=Dick|first2=John|last2=Weckert|title=\"A Philosophical Framework for Library and Information Science\", by John M.

She was one of the earliest stars to be billed under her own name, and was one of the most popular actresses of the 1910s and 1920s, earning the nickname \"Queen of the Movies\".

The [[American Film Institute]] ranked her as 24th in its 1999 list of [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|greatest female stars]] of classic Hollywood Cinema.\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Bust of Mary Pickford.jpg|left|thumb|Bust of Mary Pickford on [[University Avenue (Toronto)|University Avenue]], near her Toronto birthplace]]\nMary Pickford was born Gladys Louise Smith in 1892 (although she later claimed 1893 or 1894 as her year of birth) at 211 [[University Avenue (Toronto)|University Avenue]],{{efn|211 University Avenue at the time of Mary Pickford's birth was at the corner of University Avenue and Elm Street, now the location of the Hospital for Sick Children. University Avenue was later extended south of Queen Street and the addresses renumbered.}} [[Toronto]], Ontario.<ref name=\"Whitfield\" /> Her father, John Charles Smith, was the son of English [[Methodism|Methodist]] immigrants, and worked a variety of odd jobs. Her mother, [[Charlotte Hennessey]], was of [[Irish Catholic]] descent and worked for a time as a seamstress. She had two younger siblings, [[Lottie Pickford|Charlotte, called \"Lottie\"]] (born 1893), and [[Jack Pickford|John Charles, called \"Jack\"]] (born 1896), who also became actors. To please her husband's relatives, Pickford's mother baptized her children as Methodists, the religion of their father. John Charles Smith was an alcoholic; he abandoned the family and died on February 11, 1898, from a fatal blood clot caused by a workplace accident when he was a [[purser]] with Niagara Steamship.<ref name=\"Whitfield\" />\n\nWhen Gladys was four years old, her household was under infectious quarantine as a public health measure. Their devoutly Catholic maternal grandmother (Catherine Faeley Hennessey) asked a visiting Roman Catholic priest to baptize the children. Pickford was at this time baptized as Gladys Marie Smith.<ref>{{cite book |author=Kevin Brownlow |quote=I was baptized Gladys Marie by a French priest \u2013 Gladys Marie Smith.

She capped her short career in Toronto with the starring role of Little Eva in the Valentine production of ''[[Tom show|Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', adapted from the 1852 novel.<ref name=\"Whitfield\" />\n\n== Career ==\n=== Early years ===\n[[File:Mary Pickford 1916.jpg|right|thumb|Mary Pickford, 1916]]\nBy the early 1900s, theatre had become a family enterprise. Gladys, her mother and two younger siblings toured the United States by rail, performing in third-rate companies and plays. After six impoverished years, Pickford allowed one more summer to land a leading role on Broadway, planning to quit acting if she failed. In 1906 Gladys, Lottie and Jack Smith supported singer [[Chauncey Olcott]] on Broadway in ''[[Edmund Burke]]''.<ref>''Pictorial History of the American Theatre 1860\u20131985'' by Daniel C. Blum, c. 1985</ref> Gladys finally landed a supporting role in a 1907 Broadway play, ''[[The Warrens of Virginia (play)|The Warrens of Virginia]]''. The play was written by [[William C. deMille]], whose brother, [[Cecil B. DeMille|Cecil]], appeared in the cast. [[David Belasco]], the producer of the play, insisted that Gladys Smith assume the stage name Mary Pickford.<ref name=\"filmbug\">{{cite web|title=Mary Pickford at Filmbug.|url=http://www.filmbug.com/db/342424|publisher=Filmbug|accessdate=January 24, 2007}}</ref> After completing the Broadway run and touring the play, however, Pickford was again out of work.\n\nOn April 19, 1909, the [[American Mutoscope and Biograph Company|Biograph Company]] director [[D. W. Griffith]] screen-tested her at the company's New York studio for a role in the [[nickelodeon (movie theater)|nickelodeon]] film ''[[Pippa Passes (1909 film)|Pippa Passes]]''. The role went to someone else but Griffith was immediately taken with Pickford. She quickly grasped that movie acting was simpler than the stylized stage acting of the day. Most Biograph actors earned $5 a day but, after Pickford's single day in the studio, Griffith agreed to pay her $10 a day against a guarantee of $40 a week.<ref>Mary Pickford, ''Sunshine and Shadow'', Doubleday & Co., 1955, p. 10.</ref>\n\nPickford, like all actors at Biograph, played both bit parts and leading roles, including mothers, [[Ing\u00e9nue|ingenues]], [[Charwoman|charwomen]], spitfires, slaves, Native Americans, spurned women, and a prostitute. As Pickford said of her success at Biograph:<blockquote>I played scrubwomen and secretaries and women of all nationalities ... I decided that if I could get into as many pictures as possible, I'd become known, and there would be a demand for my work.</blockquote> She appeared in 51 films in 1909 \u2013 almost one a week. While at Biograph, she suggested to [[Florence La Badie]] to \"try pictures\", invited her to the studio and later introduced her to D. W. Griffith, who launched La Badie's career.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://11east14thstreet.com/2013/08/02/florence-la-badie-becoming/|title=FLORENCE LA BADIE, BECOMING|last=Zonarich|first=Gene|date=2013-08-03|website=11 East 14th Street|access-date=2017-04-08}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1910, Pickford traveled with a Biograph crew to Los Angeles. Many other film companies wintered on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], escaping the weak light and short days that hampered winter shooting in the [[East Coast of the United States|East]]. Pickford added to her 1909 Biographs (''Sweet and Twenty'', ''They Would Elope,'' and ''To Save Her Soul'', to name a few) with films made in California.\n\nActors were not listed in the credits in Griffith's company. Audiences noticed and identified Pickford within weeks of her first film appearance. Exhibitors, in turn, capitalized on her popularity by advertising on [[sandwich board]]s that a film featuring \"The Girl with the Golden Curls\", \"Blondilocks\", or \"The [[Biograph Girl]]\" was inside.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mary Pickford at Golden Silents.|url=http://www.goldensilents.com/stars/marypickford.html|publisher=Golden Silents.com|accessdate=January 15, 2007}}</ref>\n\nPickford left Biograph in December 1910. The following year, she starred in films at [[Carl Laemmle]]'s [[Independent Moving Pictures|Independent Moving Pictures Company]] (IMP). IMP was absorbed into [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] in 1912, along with Majestic. Unhappy with their creative standards, Pickford returned to work with Griffith in 1912. Some of her best performances were in his films, such as ''Friends'', ''The Mender of Nets'', ''Just Like a Woman'', and ''[[The Female of the Species (1912 film)|The Female of the Species]]''. That year, Pickford also introduced [[Dorothy Gish|Dorothy]] and [[Lillian Gish]]\u2013 whom she had befriended as new neighbors from Ohio<ref>{{cite book |author=Charles Affron |title=Lillian Gish: her legend, her life |url=https://books.google.com/?id=X44SqEVU2r4C&pg=PA19 |publisher=University of California Press |date=March 12, 2002 |isbn=978-0-520-23434-5 |pages=19\u201320}}</ref> \u2013to Griffith,<ref name=\"Whitfield\">Whitfield, Eileen: ''Pickford: the Woman Who Made Hollywood'' (1997), pp. 8, 25, 28, 115, 125, 126, 131, 300, 376. [[University Press of Kentucky]]; {{ISBN|0-8131-2045-4}}</ref> and each became major silent film stars, in comedy and tragedy, respectively. Pickford made her last Biograph picture, ''[[The New York Hat]]'', in late 1912.\n\nShe returned to Broadway in the David Belasco production of ''[[A Good Little Devil]]'' (1912). This was a major turning point in her career. Pickford, who had always hoped to conquer the Broadway stage, discovered how deeply she missed film acting. In 1913, she decided to work exclusively in film. The previous year, [[Adolph Zukor]] had formed [[Famous Players Film Company|Famous Players in Famous Plays]]. It was later known as [[Famous Players-Lasky]] and then [[Paramount Pictures]], one of the first American feature film companies.\n\n[[File:Mary Pickford with camera2.jpg|left|thumb|Mary Pickford, 1916]]\nPickford left the stage to join Zukor's roster of stars. Zukor believed film's potential lay in recording theatrical players in replicas of their most famous stage roles and productions. Zukor first filmed Pickford in a silent version of ''A Good Little Devil''. The film, produced in 1913, showed the play's Broadway actors reciting every line of dialogue, resulting in a stiff film that Pickford later called \"one of the worst [features] I ever made ... it was deadly\".<ref name=\"Whitfield\" /> Zukor agreed; he held the film back from distribution for a year.\n\nPickford's work in material written for the camera by that time had attracted a strong following. Comedy-dramas, such as ''[[In the Bishop's Carriage]]'' (1913), ''[[Caprice (1913 film)|Caprice]]'' (1913), and especially ''[[Hearts Adrift]]'' (1914), made her irresistible to moviegoers.

Throughout the 1910s and 1920s, Pickford was believed to be the most famous woman in the world, or, as a silent-film journalist described her, \"the best known woman who has ever lived, the woman who was known to more people and loved by more people than any other woman that has been in all history\".<ref name=\"Whitfield\" />\n\n=== Stardom ===\n[[File:Mary Pickford-Ziegfeld.jpg|right|thumb|Mary Pickford, 1920]]\n\nPickford starred in 52 features throughout her career.

Pickford's fans were devoted to these \"little girl\" roles, but they were not typical of her career.<ref name=\"Whitfield\" /> Due to her lack of a normal childhood, she enjoyed making these pictures. Given how small she was at under five feet, and her naturalistic acting abilities, she was very successful in these roles. [[Douglas Fairbanks Jr.]], when he first met her in person as a boy, assumed she was a new playmate for him, and asked her to come and play trains with him, which she obligingly did.<ref>Clip of Douglas Fairbanks Jr. describing this incident. ''Mary Pickford: Muse of the Movies'', 2008. Documentary.</ref>\n\nIn August 1918, Pickford's contract expired and, when refusing Zukor's terms for a renewal, she was offered $250,000 to leave the motion picture business. She declined, and went to [[First National Pictures]], which agreed to her terms.<ref>''The New York Times'', October 29, 1925<!-- page?? --></ref> In 1919, Pickford, along with D.W. Griffith, [[Charlie Chaplin]], and [[Douglas Fairbanks]], formed the independent film production company [[United Artists]]. Through United Artists, Pickford continued to produce and perform in her own movies; she could also distribute them as she chose. In 1920, Pickford's film ''[[Pollyanna (1920 film)|Pollyanna]]'' grossed around $1,100,000.<ref name=\"OP\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/pickford/timeline/timeline2.html|title=Timeline: Mary Pickford|work=American Experience|publisher=PBS|date=July 23, 2004|accessdate=January 11, 2009}}</ref> The following year, Pickford's film ''[[Little Lord Fauntleroy (1921 film)|Little Lord Fauntleroy]]'' was also a success, and in 1923, ''[[Rosita (film)|Rosita]]'' grossed over $1,000,000 as well.<ref name=\"OP\" /> During this period, she also made [[Little Annie Rooney (1925 film)|''Little Annie Rooney'']] (1925), another film in which Pickford played a child, ''[[Sparrows (1926 film)|Sparrows]]'' (1926), which blended the [[Dickensian]] with newly minted [[German expressionism|German expressionist]] style, and ''[[My Best Girl (1927 film)|My Best Girl]]'' (1927), a romantic comedy featuring her future husband [[Buddy Rogers (actor)|Buddy Rogers]].\n\n[[File:MaryPickford4.jpg|left|thumb|A [[Movie poster#Lobby cards|lobby card]] for ''[[Little Lord Fauntleroy (1921 film)|Little Lord Fauntleroy]]'' (1921)]]\n\nThe arrival of sound was her undoing. Pickford underestimated the value of adding sound to movies, claiming that \"adding sound to movies would be like putting lipstick on the [[Venus de Milo]]\".<ref name=\"OP\" />\n\nShe played a reckless socialite in ''[[Coquette (film)|Coquette]]'' (1929), a role for which her famous [[Ringlet (haircut)|ringlets]] were cut into a 1920s' [[bob cut|bob]]. Pickford had already cut her hair in the wake of her mother's death in 1928.

On March 29, 1928, ''The Dodge Brothers Hour'' was broadcast from Pickford's bungalow, featuring Fairbanks, Chaplin, [[Norma Talmadge]], [[Gloria Swanson]], [[John Barrymore]], [[D.W. Griffith]], and [[Dolores del R\u00edo]], among others.

In 1933, she underwent a [[Technicolor]] screen test for an animated/live action film version of ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'', but [[Walt Disney]] discarded the project when [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] released its own version of the book. Only one Technicolor [[Film still|still]]<!-- or is this [[still frame]]? --> of her screen test still exists. She retired from acting in 1933; her last acting film was released in 1934. She continued to produce for others, however, including ''[[Sleep, My Love]]'' (1948; with [[Claudette Colbert]]) and ''[[Love Happy]]'' (1949), with the [[Marx Brothers]]).<ref name=\"Whitfield\" />\n\n=== The film industry ===\n[[File:MaryPickfordHoover.gif|right|thumb|Mary Pickford giving President [[Herbert Hoover]] a ticket for a film industry benefit for the unemployed, 1931]]\nPickford used her stature in the movie industry to promote a variety of causes. Although her image depicted fragility and innocence, she proved to be a strong businesswoman who took control of her career in a cutthroat industry.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |title=The Star System: Hollywood's Production of Popular Identities |last=McDonald |first=Paul |publisher=Wallflower |year=2000 |isbn=978-1-903364-02-4 |location=London |page=33}}</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War I]] she promoted the sale of [[Liberty Bond]]s, making an intensive series of fund-raising speeches, beginning in Washington, D.C., where she sold bonds alongside [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Douglas Fairbanks]], [[Theda Bara]], and [[Marie Dressler]]. Five days later she spoke on [[Wall Street]] to an estimated 50,000 people. Though Canadian-born, she was a powerful symbol of [[Americana]], kissing the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] for cameras and auctioning one of her world-famous curls for $15,000. In a single speech in Chicago she sold an estimated five million dollars' worth of bonds. She was christened the U.S. Navy's official \"Little Sister\"; the Army named two cannons after her and made her an honorary colonel.<ref name=\"Whitfield\" />\n\n[[File:Portrait photograph of Mary Pickford, 1921.jpg|thumb|Portrait photograph of Mary Pickford, 1921]]\n\nAt the end of World War I, Pickford conceived of the [[Motion Picture & Television Fund|Motion Picture Relief Fund]], an organization to help financially needy actors. Leftover funds from her work selling Liberty Bonds were put toward its creation, and in 1921, the Motion Picture Relief Fund (MPRF) was officially incorporated, with [[Joseph Schenck]] voted its first president and Pickford its vice president. In 1932, Pickford spearheaded the \"Payroll Pledge Program\", a payroll-deduction plan for studio workers who gave one half of one percent of their earnings to the MPRF. As a result, in 1940, the Fund was able to purchase land and build the [[Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital|Motion Picture Country House and Hospital]], in [[Woodland Hills, California]].<ref name=\"Whitfield\" />\n\nAn astute businesswoman, Pickford became her own producer within three years of her start in features. According to her Foundation, \"she oversaw every aspect of the making of her films, from hiring talent and crew to overseeing the script, the shooting, the editing, to the final release and promotion of each project\". She demanded (and received) these powers in 1916, when she was under contract to Zukor's Famous Players in Famous Plays (later Paramount). Zukor acquiesced to her refusal to participate in block-booking, the widespread practice of forcing an exhibitor to show a bad film of the studio's choosing to also be able to show a Pickford film. In 1916, Pickford's films were distributed, singly, through a special distribution unit called Artcraft. The Mary Pickford Corporation was briefly Pickford's motion-picture production company.<ref name=\"ushistory\" />\n\n[[File:Mary Pickford signing the entrance to the Mary Pickford War Funds bungalow.jpg|left|thumb|Mary Pickford War Funds bungalow, 1943]]\nIn 1919, she increased her power by co-founding [[United Artists]] (UA) with Charlie Chaplin, D. W. Griffith, and her soon-to-be husband, Douglas Fairbanks. Before UA's creation, Hollywood studios were vertically integrated, not only producing films but forming chains of theaters. Distributors (also part of the studios) arranged for company productions to be shown in the company's movie venues. Filmmakers relied on the studios for bookings; in return they put up with what many considered creative interference.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nUnited Artists broke from this tradition. It was solely a distribution company, offering independent film producers access to its own screens as well as the rental of temporarily unbooked cinemas owned by other companies. Pickford and Fairbanks produced and shot their films after 1920 at the jointly owned Pickford-Fairbanks studio on [[Santa Monica Boulevard]]. The producers who signed with UA were true independents, producing, creating and controlling their work to an unprecedented degree. As a co-founder, as well as the producer and star of her own films, Pickford became the most powerful woman who has ever worked in Hollywood. By 1930, Pickford's acting career had largely faded.<ref name=\"mdecline\" /> After retiring three years later, however, she continued to produce films for United Artists. She and Chaplin remained partners in the company for decades. Chaplin left the company in 1955, and Pickford followed suit in 1956, selling her remaining shares for three million dollars.<ref name=\"ushistory\">{{cite web|title=Mary Pickford biography|url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h3890.html|accessdate=January 24, 2007}}</ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\n[[File:Mary Pickford portrait.jpg|thumb|right|Mary Pickford, 1921]]\nPickford was married three times. She married [[Owen Moore]], an Irish-born silent film actor, on January 7, 1911. It is rumored she became pregnant by Moore in the early 1910s and had a [[miscarriage]] or an [[abortion]]. Some accounts suggest this resulted in her later inability to have children.<ref name=\"Whitfield\" /> The couple's marriage was strained by Moore's alcoholism, insecurity about living in the shadow of Pickford's fame, and bouts of [[domestic violence]].{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} The couple lived together on-and-off for several years.<ref>Peggy Dymond Leavey, ''Mary Pickford: Canada's Silent Siren, America's Sweetheart''. Dundurn Press (2011), pp. 80\u201381<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref>\n\nPickford became secretly involved in a relationship with [[Douglas Fairbanks]]. They toured the U.S. together in 1918 to promote [[Liberty Bond]] sales for the World War I effort. Around this time, Pickford also suffered from the flu during the [[1918 flu pandemic]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Kirsty Duncan|title=Hunting the 1918 Flu: One Scientist's Search for a Killer Virus |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8YEFuNHTrToC&pg=PA16 |accessdate=January 12, 2013 |date=19 August 2006 |publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]] |isbn=978-0-8020-9456-8 |page=16}}</ref> Pickford divorced Moore on March 2, 1920, after she agreed to his $100,000 demand for a settlement.<ref>Peggy Dymond Leavey, ''Mary Pickford: Canada's Silent Siren, America's Sweetheart''.

They went to Europe for their honeymoon; fans in London and in Paris caused riots trying to get to the famous couple. The couple's triumphant return to Hollywood was witnessed by vast crowds who turned out to hail them at railway stations across the United States.\n\n''[[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' (1920) and a series of other swashbucklers gave the popular Fairbanks a more romantic, heroic image. Pickford continued to epitomize the virtuous but fiery girl next door. Even at private parties, people instinctively stood up when Pickford entered a room; she and her husband were often referred to as \"Hollywood royalty\". Their international reputations were broad. Foreign heads of state and dignitaries who visited the [[White House]] often asked if they could also visit [[Pickfair]], the couple's mansion in Beverly Hills.<ref name=\"filmbug\" />\n\nDinners at Pickfair became celebrity events. [[Charlie Chaplin]], Fairbanks' best friend, was often present. Other guests included [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Elinor Glyn]], [[Helen Keller]], [[H. G.

The public nature of Pickford's second marriage strained it to the breaking point. Both she and Fairbanks had little time off from producing and acting in their films. They were also constantly on display as America's unofficial ambassadors to the world, leading parades, cutting ribbons, and making speeches. When their film careers both began to flounder at the end of the silent era, Fairbanks' restless nature prompted him to overseas travel (something which Pickford did not enjoy). When Fairbanks' romance with [[Sylvia Ashley|Sylvia, Lady Ashley]] became public in the early 1930s, he and Pickford separated. They divorced January 10, 1936. Fairbanks' son by his first wife, [[Douglas Fairbanks Jr.]], claimed his father and Pickford long regretted their inability to reconcile.<ref name=\"Whitfield\" />\n\nOn June 24, 1937, Pickford married her third and last husband, actor and band leader [[Charles 'Buddy' Rogers|Buddy Rogers]]. They adopted two children: Roxanne (born 1944, adopted 1944) and Ronald Charles (born 1937, adopted 1943, a.k.a. Ronnie Pickford Rogers). A PBS ''[[American Experience]]'' documentary described Pickford's relationship with her children as tense. She criticized their physical imperfections, including Ronnie's small stature and Roxanne's crooked teeth. Both children later said their mother was too self-absorbed to provide real maternal love. In 2003, Ronnie recalled that \"Things didn't work out that much, you know. But I'll never forget her. I think that she was a good woman.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/pickford/peopleevents/p_rogers.html|title=Buddy Rogers, Mary Pickford and Their Children|accessdate=August 26, 2007|publisher=American Experience}}</ref>\n\n=== Later years and death ===\n[[File:Mary Pickford 1934.JPG|thumb|right|Mary Pickford in ''Star Night at the Cocoanut Grove'' (1934), her only film appearance in Technicolor]]\nAfter retiring from the screen, Pickford became an alcoholic, as her father had been. Her mother Charlotte died of breast cancer in March 1928. Her siblings, Lottie and Jack, both died of alcohol-related causes. These deaths, her divorce from Fairbanks, and the end of silent films left Pickford deeply depressed. Her relationship with her adopted children, Roxanne and Ronald, was turbulent at best. Pickford withdrew and gradually became a recluse, remaining almost entirely at Pickfair and allowing visits only from [[Lillian Gish]], her stepson [[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.]], and few other people. She appeared in court in 1959, in a matter pertaining to her co-ownership of North Carolina TV station [[WSJS-TV]]. The court date coincided with the date of her 67th birthday; under oath, when asked to give her age, Pickford replied: \"I'm 21, going on 20.\"<ref>\"Mary Pickford \"Going On 20\" (Or Is It 66?)\", ''The Ottawa Citizen'', April 11, 1959, p. 18</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1960s, Pickford often received visitors only by telephone, speaking to them from her bedroom. [[Charles Buddy Rogers|Buddy Rogers]] often gave guests tours of Pickfair, including views of a genuine western bar Pickford had bought for Douglas Fairbanks, and a portrait of Pickford in the drawing room. A print of this image now hangs in the [[Library of Congress]].<ref name=\"ushistory\" /> In addition to her Oscar as best actress for ''Coquette'' (1929), Mary Pickford received an [[Academy Honorary Award]] in 1976 for lifetime achievement. The Academy sent a TV crew to her house to record her short statement of thanks \u2013 offering the public a very rare glimpse into Pickfair Manor.<ref>{{cite AV media | title = The 48th Annual Academy Awards | date = March 29, 1976 | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vXhqrbSeOE}}</ref>\n\nPickford believed that she had ceased to be a [[British subject]] when she married an American citizen upon her marriage to Fairbanks in 1920.<ref>{{cite magazine |date=April 30, 1949|title=Mary Pickford Files TV Bid |magazine=Billboard |publisher=Nielsen Business Media |page=14|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> Thus, she never acquired Canadian citizenship when it was first created in 1947. However, Pickford held and traveled under a British/Canadian passport which she renewed regularly at the British/Canadian consulates in Los Angeles, and she did not take out papers for American citizenship. She also owned a house in Toronto, Canada. Toward the end of her life, Pickford made arrangements with the Canadian Department of Citizenship to officially acquire Canadian citizenship because she wished to \"die as a Canadian\". Canadian authorities were not sure that she had ever lost her Canadian citizenship, given her passport status, but her request was approved and she officially became a Canadian citizen.<ref>{{cite book|last=Colombo|first=John Robert|title=Fascinating Canada: A Book of Questions and Answers|year=2011|publisher=Dundurn|isbn=978-1-55488-923-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/fascinatingcanad0000colo/page/20 20]|url=https://archive.org/details/fascinatingcanad0000colo/page/20}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YJlVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=LkANAAAAIBAJ&pg=2767,848052&dq=mary+pickford+citizenship&hl=en|title=City, fans honor Mary Pickford|date=May 18, 1983|work=The Leader-Post|pages=D\u20138|accessdate=November 26, 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Mary Pickford Tomb.JPG|thumb|The tomb of actress Mary Pickford in the Garden of Memory, Forest Lawn Glendale]]\nOn May 29, 1979, Pickford died at a [[Santa Monica, California]], hospital of complications from a [[cerebral hemorrhage]] she had suffered the week before.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1964&dat=19790530&id=GkgjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Kc0FAAAAIBAJ&pg=6637,4772311|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130124175355/http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1964&dat=19790530&id=GkgjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Kc0FAAAAIBAJ&pg=6637,4772311|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 24, 2013|title=Mary Pickford Is Dead at 86|date=May 30, 1979|work=The Palm Beach Post|accessdate=26 November 2012}}</ref> She was interred in the Garden of Memory of the [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park]] cemetery in [[Glendale, California|Glendale]], California.\n\n== Legacy ==\n{{refimprove section|date=September 2016}}\n\n* Pickford was awarded a star in the category of motion pictures on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6280 Hollywood Blvd.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/mary-pickford|title=Mary Pickford \u2013 Hollywood Walk of Fame|publisher=}}</ref>\n* Her handprints and footprints are displayed at [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]] in Hollywood, California.\n* The [[Pickford Center for Motion Picture Study]] at 1313 Vine Street in Hollywood, constructed by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, opened in 1948 as a radio and television studio facility.\n* The [[Mary Pickford Theater]] at the [[James Madison Memorial Building]] of the [[Library of Congress]] is named in her honor.<ref name=\"ushistory\" />\n* The Mary Pickford Auditorium at [[Claremont McKenna College]] is named in her honor.\n* In 1948, Mary Pickford built a 7 bedrooms, 8 bathroom, and 6,050 square foot estate on 2.12 acres at the [[B Bar H Ranch, California]] where she lived and then later sold.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.estately.com/listings/info/19120-bubbling-wells-road--14|title=19120 Bubbling Wells Road|publisher=}}</ref>\n* A first-run movie theatre in [[Cathedral City, California]] is called The Mary Pickford Theatre, which was established on May 25, 2001.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Iannucci|first1=Lisa|title=On Location: A Film and TV Lover's Travel Guide|date=March 1, 2018|publisher=Globe Pequot Press|isbn=978-1-4930-3085-9|page=28|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=_QNBDwAAQBAJ}}</ref> The theater is a grand one with several screens and is built in the shape of a Spanish Cathedral, complete with bell tower and three-story lobby.

professionally as '''Mary Pickford''', was a Canadian-born American film actress and producer with a career spanning 50 years. She was a co-founder of the [[Pickford\u2013Fairbanks Studios]] with [[Douglas Fairbanks]] and the [[United Artists]] studio with Fairbanks, [[Charlie Chaplin]], and [[D. W. Griffith]], and she was one of the 36 founders of the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] who present the yearly [[Academy Awards|\"Oscar\" Awards]] ceremony.<ref>Obituary ''Variety'', May 30, 1979.</ref>\n\nPickford was known in her prime as \"America's Sweetheart\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Baldwin |first1=Douglas |last2=Baldwin |first2=Patricia |title=The 1930s |year=2000 |publisher=Weigl |isbn=1-896990-64-9 |page=12}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Flom |first=Eric L. |title=Silent Film Stars on the Stages of Seattle: A History of Performances by Hollywood Notables |year=2009 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-0-7864-3908-9 |page=226}}</ref><ref name=\"Sonneborn\">{{cite book |last=Sonneborn |first=Liz |title=A to Z of American Women in the Performing Arts |year=2002 |publisher=Infobase |isbn=1-4381-0790-0 |page=166}}</ref> and the \"girl with the curls\".<ref name=\"Sonneborn\" /> She was one of the [[Canadian pioneers in early Hollywood]] and a significant figure in the development of film acting. She was one of the earliest stars to be billed under her own name, and was one of the most popular actresses of the 1910s and 1920s, earning the nickname \"Queen of the Movies\". She is credited with having defined the {{lang|fr|[[ing\u00e9nue]]}} type in cinema.<ref>{{cite web |first1=Claire |last1=Love |first2=Jen |last2=Pollack |first3=Alison |last3=Landsberg |title=Silent Film Actresses and Their Most Popular Characters |url=https://www.womenshistory.org/articles/silent-film-actresses-and-their-most-popular-characters |publisher=National Women's History Museum |year=2017}}</ref>\n\nShe was awarded the second [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her first sound film role in ''[[Coquette (film)|Coquette]]'' (1929), and she also received an honorary Academy Award in 1976 in consideration of her contributions to American cinema. The [[American Film Institute]] ranked her as 24th in its 1999 list of [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|greatest female stars]] of classic Hollywood Cinema.\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Bust of Mary Pickford.jpg|left|thumb|Bust of Mary Pickford on [[University Avenue (Toronto)|University Avenue]], near her Toronto birthplace]]\nMary Pickford was born Gladys Louise Smith in 1892 (although she later claimed 1893 or 1894 as her year of birth) at 211 [[University Avenue (Toronto)|University Avenue]],{{efn|211 University Avenue at the time of Mary Pickford's birth was at the corner of University Avenue and Elm Street, now the location of the Hospital for Sick Children. University Avenue was later extended south of Queen Street and the addresses renumbered.}} [[Toronto]], Ontario.<ref name=\"Whitfield\" /> Her father, John Charles Smith, was the son of English [[Methodism|Methodist]] immigrants, and worked a variety of odd jobs. Her mother, [[Charlotte Hennessey]], was of [[Irish Catholic]] descent and worked for a time as a seamstress. She had two younger siblings, [[Lottie Pickford|Charlotte, called \"Lottie\"]] (born 1893), and [[Jack Pickford|John Charles, called \"Jack\"]] (born 1896), who also became actors. To please her husband's relatives, Pickford's mother baptized her children as Methodists, the religion of their father. John Charles Smith was an alcoholic; he abandoned the family and died on February 11, 1898, from a fatal blood clot caused by a workplace accident when he was a [[purser]] with Niagara Steamship.<ref name=\"Whitfield\" />\n\nWhen Gladys was four years old, her household was under infectious quarantine as a public health measure. Their devoutly Catholic maternal grandmother (Catherine Faeley Hennessey) asked a visiting Roman Catholic priest to baptize the children. Pickford was at this time baptized as Gladys Marie Smith.<ref>{{cite book |author=Kevin Brownlow |quote=I was baptized Gladys Marie by a French priest \u2013 Gladys Marie Smith.

She capped her short career in Toronto with the starring role of Little Eva in the Valentine production of ''[[Tom show|Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', adapted from the 1852 novel.<ref name=\"Whitfield\" />\n\n== Career ==\n=== Early years ===\n[[File:Mary Pickford 1916.jpg|right|thumb|Mary Pickford, 1916]]\nBy the early 1900s, theatre had become a family enterprise. Gladys, her mother and two younger siblings toured the United States by rail, performing in third-rate companies and plays. After six impoverished years, Pickford allowed one more summer to land a leading role on Broadway, planning to quit acting if she failed. In 1906 Gladys, Lottie and Jack Smith supported singer [[Chauncey Olcott]] on Broadway in ''[[Edmund Burke]]''.<ref>''Pictorial History of the American Theatre 1860\u20131985'' by Daniel C. Blum, c. 1985</ref> Gladys finally landed a supporting role in a 1907 Broadway play, ''[[The Warrens of Virginia (play)|The Warrens of Virginia]]''. The play was written by [[William C. deMille]], whose brother, [[Cecil B. DeMille|Cecil]], appeared in the cast. [[David Belasco]], the producer of the play, insisted that Gladys Smith assume the stage name Mary Pickford.<ref name=\"filmbug\">{{cite web|title=Mary Pickford at Filmbug.|url=http://www.filmbug.com/db/342424|publisher=Filmbug|accessdate=January 24, 2007}}</ref> After completing the Broadway run and touring the play, however, Pickford was again out of work.\n\nOn April 19, 1909, the [[American Mutoscope and Biograph Company|Biograph Company]] director [[D. W. Griffith]] screen-tested her at the company's New York studio for a role in the [[nickelodeon (movie theater)|nickelodeon]] film ''[[Pippa Passes (1909 film)|Pippa Passes]]''. The role went to someone else but Griffith was immediately taken with Pickford. She quickly grasped that movie acting was simpler than the stylized stage acting of the day. Most Biograph actors earned $5 a day but, after Pickford's single day in the studio, Griffith agreed to pay her $10 a day against a guarantee of $40 a week.<ref>Mary Pickford, ''Sunshine and Shadow'', Doubleday & Co., 1955, p. 10.</ref>\n\nPickford, like all actors at Biograph, played both bit parts and leading roles, including mothers, [[Ing\u00e9nue|ingenues]], [[Charwoman|charwomen]], spitfires, slaves, Native Americans, spurned women, and a prostitute. As Pickford said of her success at Biograph:<blockquote>I played scrubwomen and secretaries and women of all nationalities ... I decided that if I could get into as many pictures as possible, I'd become known, and there would be a demand for my work.</blockquote> She appeared in 51 films in 1909 \u2013 almost one a week. While at Biograph, she suggested to [[Florence La Badie]] to \"try pictures\", invited her to the studio and later introduced her to D. W. Griffith, who launched La Badie's career.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://11east14thstreet.com/2013/08/02/florence-la-badie-becoming/|title=FLORENCE LA BADIE, BECOMING|last=Zonarich|first=Gene|date=2013-08-03|website=11 East 14th Street|access-date=2017-04-08}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1910, Pickford traveled with a Biograph crew to Los Angeles. Many other film companies wintered on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], escaping the weak light and short days that hampered winter shooting in the [[East Coast of the United States|East]]. Pickford added to her 1909 Biographs (''Sweet and Twenty'', ''They Would Elope,'' and ''To Save Her Soul'', to name a few) with films made in California.\n\nActors were not listed in the credits in Griffith's company. Audiences noticed and identified Pickford within weeks of her first film appearance. Exhibitors, in turn, capitalized on her popularity by advertising on [[sandwich board]]s that a film featuring \"The Girl with the Golden Curls\", \"Blondilocks\", or \"The [[Biograph Girl]]\" was inside.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mary Pickford at Golden Silents.|url=http://www.goldensilents.com/stars/marypickford.html|publisher=Golden Silents.com|accessdate=January 15, 2007}}</ref>\n\nPickford left Biograph in December 1910. The following year, she starred in films at [[Carl Laemmle]]'s [[Independent Moving Pictures|Independent Moving Pictures Company]] (IMP). IMP was absorbed into [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] in 1912, along with Majestic. Unhappy with their creative standards, Pickford returned to work with Griffith in 1912. Some of her best performances were in his films, such as ''Friends'', ''The Mender of Nets'', ''Just Like a Woman'', and ''[[The Female of the Species (1912 film)|The Female of the Species]]''. That year, Pickford also introduced [[Dorothy Gish|Dorothy]] and [[Lillian Gish]]\u2013 whom she had befriended as new neighbors from Ohio<ref>{{cite book |author=Charles Affron |title=Lillian Gish: her legend, her life |url=https://books.google.com/?id=X44SqEVU2r4C&pg=PA19 |publisher=University of California Press |date=March 12, 2002 |isbn=978-0-520-23434-5 |pages=19\u201320}}</ref> \u2013to Griffith,<ref name=\"Whitfield\">Whitfield, Eileen: ''Pickford: the Woman Who Made Hollywood'' (1997), pp. 8, 25, 28, 115, 125, 126, 131, 300, 376. [[University Press of Kentucky]]; {{ISBN|0-8131-2045-4}}</ref> and each became major silent film stars, in comedy and tragedy, respectively. Pickford made her last Biograph picture, ''[[The New York Hat]]'', in late 1912.\n\nShe returned to Broadway in the David Belasco production of ''[[A Good Little Devil]]'' (1912). This was a major turning point in her career. Pickford, who had always hoped to conquer the Broadway stage, discovered how deeply she missed film acting. In 1913, she decided to work exclusively in film. The previous year, [[Adolph Zukor]] had formed [[Famous Players Film Company|Famous Players in Famous Plays]]. It was later known as [[Famous Players-Lasky]] and then [[Paramount Pictures]], one of the first American feature film companies.\n\n[[File:Mary Pickford with camera2.jpg|left|thumb|Mary Pickford, 1916]]\nPickford left the stage to join Zukor's roster of stars. Zukor believed film's potential lay in recording theatrical players in replicas of their most famous stage roles and productions. Zukor first filmed Pickford in a silent version of ''A Good Little Devil''. The film, produced in 1913, showed the play's Broadway actors reciting every line of dialogue, resulting in a stiff film that Pickford later called \"one of the worst [features] I ever made ... it was deadly\".<ref name=\"Whitfield\" /> Zukor agreed; he held the film back from distribution for a year.\n\nPickford's work in material written for the camera by that time had attracted a strong following. Comedy-dramas, such as ''[[In the Bishop's Carriage]]'' (1913), ''[[Caprice (1913 film)|Caprice]]'' (1913), and especially ''[[Hearts Adrift]]'' (1914), made her irresistible to moviegoers. ''Hearts Adrift'' was so popular that Pickford asked for the first of her many publicized pay raises based on the profits and reviews.<ref name=\"Kevin Brownlow\">{{cite book|last1=Brownlow|first1=Kevin|title=Mary Pickford Rediscovered|date=May 1, 1999|publisher=Harry N.

Each enjoyed a level of fame far exceeding that of other actors. Throughout the 1910s and 1920s, Pickford was believed to be the most famous woman in the world, or, as a silent-film journalist described her, \"the best known woman who has ever lived, the woman who was known to more people and loved by more people than any other woman that has been in all history\".<ref name=\"Whitfield\" />\n\n=== Stardom ===\n[[File:Mary Pickford-Ziegfeld.jpg|right|thumb|Mary Pickford, 1920]]\n\nPickford starred in 52 features throughout her career.

Pickford's fans were devoted to these \"little girl\" roles, but they were not typical of her career.<ref name=\"Whitfield\" /> Due to her lack of a normal childhood, she enjoyed making these pictures. Given how small she was at under five feet, and her naturalistic acting abilities, she was very successful in these roles. [[Douglas Fairbanks Jr.]], when he first met her in person as a boy, assumed she was a new playmate for him, and asked her to come and play trains with him, which she obligingly did.<ref>Clip of Douglas Fairbanks Jr. describing this incident. ''Mary Pickford: Muse of the Movies'', 2008. Documentary.</ref>\n\nIn August 1918, Pickford's contract expired and, when refusing Zukor's terms for a renewal, she was offered $250,000 to leave the motion picture business. She declined, and went to [[First National Pictures]], which agreed to her terms.<ref>''The New York Times'', October 29, 1925<!-- page?? --></ref> In 1919, Pickford, along with D.W. Griffith, [[Charlie Chaplin]], and [[Douglas Fairbanks]], formed the independent film production company [[United Artists]]. Through United Artists, Pickford continued to produce and perform in her own movies; she could also distribute them as she chose. In 1920, Pickford's film ''[[Pollyanna (1920 film)|Pollyanna]]'' grossed around $1,100,000.<ref name=\"OP\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/pickford/timeline/timeline2.html|title=Timeline: Mary Pickford|work=American Experience|publisher=PBS|date=July 23, 2004|accessdate=January 11, 2009}}</ref> The following year, Pickford's film ''[[Little Lord Fauntleroy (1921 film)|Little Lord Fauntleroy]]'' was also a success, and in 1923, ''[[Rosita (film)|Rosita]]'' grossed over $1,000,000 as well.<ref name=\"OP\" /> During this period, she also made [[Little Annie Rooney (1925 film)|''Little Annie Rooney'']] (1925), another film in which Pickford played a child, ''[[Sparrows (1926 film)|Sparrows]]'' (1926), which blended the [[Dickensian]] with newly minted [[German expressionism|German expressionist]] style, and ''[[My Best Girl (1927 film)|My Best Girl]]'' (1927), a romantic comedy featuring her future husband [[Buddy Rogers (actor)|Buddy Rogers]].\n\n[[File:MaryPickford4.jpg|left|thumb|A [[Movie poster#Lobby cards|lobby card]] for ''[[Little Lord Fauntleroy (1921 film)|Little Lord Fauntleroy]]'' (1921)]]\n\nThe arrival of sound was her undoing. Pickford underestimated the value of adding sound to movies, claiming that \"adding sound to movies would be like putting lipstick on the [[Venus de Milo]]\".<ref name=\"OP\" />\n\nShe played a reckless socialite in ''[[Coquette (film)|Coquette]]'' (1929), a role for which her famous [[Ringlet (haircut)|ringlets]] were cut into a 1920s' [[bob cut|bob]]. Pickford had already cut her hair in the wake of her mother's death in 1928.

On March 29, 1928, ''The Dodge Brothers Hour'' was broadcast from Pickford's bungalow, featuring Fairbanks, Chaplin, [[Norma Talmadge]], [[Gloria Swanson]], [[John Barrymore]], [[D.W. Griffith]], and [[Dolores del R\u00edo]], among others.

In 1933, she underwent a [[Technicolor]] screen test for an animated/live action film version of ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'', but [[Walt Disney]] discarded the project when [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] released its own version of the book. Only one Technicolor [[Film still|still]]<!-- or is this [[still frame]]? --> of her screen test still exists. She retired from acting in 1933; her last acting film was released in 1934. She continued to produce for others, however, including ''[[Sleep, My Love]]'' (1948; with [[Claudette Colbert]]) and ''[[Love Happy]]'' (1949), with the [[Marx Brothers]]).<ref name=\"Whitfield\" />\n\n=== The film industry ===\n[[File:MaryPickfordHoover.gif|right|thumb|Mary Pickford giving President [[Herbert Hoover]] a ticket for a film industry benefit for the unemployed, 1931]]\nPickford used her stature in the movie industry to promote a variety of causes. Although her image depicted fragility and innocence, she proved to be a strong businesswoman who took control of her career in a cutthroat industry.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |title=The Star System: Hollywood's Production of Popular Identities |last=McDonald |first=Paul |publisher=Wallflower |year=2000 |isbn=978-1-903364-02-4 |location=London |page=33}}</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War I]] she promoted the sale of [[Liberty Bond]]s, making an intensive series of fund-raising speeches, beginning in Washington, D.C., where she sold bonds alongside [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Douglas Fairbanks]], [[Theda Bara]], and [[Marie Dressler]]. Five days later she spoke on [[Wall Street]] to an estimated 50,000 people. Though Canadian-born, she was a powerful symbol of [[Americana]], kissing the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] for cameras and auctioning one of her world-famous curls for $15,000. In a single speech in Chicago she sold an estimated five million dollars' worth of bonds. She was christened the U.S. Navy's official \"Little Sister\"; the Army named two cannons after her and made her an honorary colonel.<ref name=\"Whitfield\" />\n\n[[File:Portrait photograph of Mary Pickford, 1921.jpg|thumb|Portrait photograph of Mary Pickford, 1921]]\n\nAt the end of World War I, Pickford conceived of the [[Motion Picture & Television Fund|Motion Picture Relief Fund]], an organization to help financially needy actors. Leftover funds from her work selling Liberty Bonds were put toward its creation, and in 1921, the Motion Picture Relief Fund (MPRF) was officially incorporated, with [[Joseph Schenck]] voted its first president and Pickford its vice president. In 1932, Pickford spearheaded the \"Payroll Pledge Program\", a payroll-deduction plan for studio workers who gave one half of one percent of their earnings to the MPRF. As a result, in 1940, the Fund was able to purchase land and build the [[Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital|Motion Picture Country House and Hospital]], in [[Woodland Hills, California]].<ref name=\"Whitfield\" />\n\nAn astute businesswoman, Pickford became her own producer within three years of her start in features. According to her Foundation, \"she oversaw every aspect of the making of her films, from hiring talent and crew to overseeing the script, the shooting, the editing, to the final release and promotion of each project\". She demanded (and received) these powers in 1916, when she was under contract to Zukor's Famous Players in Famous Plays (later Paramount). Zukor acquiesced to her refusal to participate in block-booking, the widespread practice of forcing an exhibitor to show a bad film of the studio's choosing to also be able to show a Pickford film. In 1916, Pickford's films were distributed, singly, through a special distribution unit called Artcraft. The Mary Pickford Corporation was briefly Pickford's motion-picture production company.<ref name=\"ushistory\" />\n\n[[File:Mary Pickford signing the entrance to the Mary Pickford War Funds bungalow.jpg|left|thumb|Mary Pickford War Funds bungalow, 1943]]\nIn 1919, she increased her power by co-founding [[United Artists]] (UA) with Charlie Chaplin, D. W. Griffith, and her soon-to-be husband, Douglas Fairbanks. Before UA's creation, Hollywood studios were vertically integrated, not only producing films but forming chains of theaters. Distributors (also part of the studios) arranged for company productions to be shown in the company's movie venues. Filmmakers relied on the studios for bookings; in return they put up with what many considered creative interference.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nUnited Artists broke from this tradition. It was solely a distribution company, offering independent film producers access to its own screens as well as the rental of temporarily unbooked cinemas owned by other companies. Pickford and Fairbanks produced and shot their films after 1920 at the jointly owned Pickford-Fairbanks studio on [[Santa Monica Boulevard]]. The producers who signed with UA were true independents, producing, creating and controlling their work to an unprecedented degree. As a co-founder, as well as the producer and star of her own films, Pickford became the most powerful woman who has ever worked in Hollywood. By 1930, Pickford's acting career had largely faded.<ref name=\"mdecline\" /> After retiring three years later, however, she continued to produce films for United Artists. She and Chaplin remained partners in the company for decades. Chaplin left the company in 1955, and Pickford followed suit in 1956, selling her remaining shares for three million dollars.<ref name=\"ushistory\">{{cite web|title=Mary Pickford biography|url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h3890.html|accessdate=January 24, 2007}}</ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\n[[File:Mary Pickford portrait.jpg|thumb|right|Mary Pickford, 1921]]\nPickford was married three times. She married [[Owen Moore]], an Irish-born silent film actor, on January 7, 1911. It is rumored she became pregnant by Moore in the early 1910s and had a [[miscarriage]] or an [[abortion]]. Some accounts suggest this resulted in her later inability to have children.<ref name=\"Whitfield\" /> The couple's marriage was strained by Moore's alcoholism, insecurity about living in the shadow of Pickford's fame, and bouts of [[domestic violence]].{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} The couple lived together on-and-off for several years.<ref>Peggy Dymond Leavey, ''Mary Pickford: Canada's Silent Siren, America's Sweetheart''. Dundurn Press (2011), pp. 80\u201381<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref>\n\nPickford became secretly involved in a relationship with [[Douglas Fairbanks]]. They toured the U.S. together in 1918 to promote [[Liberty Bond]] sales for the World War I effort. Around this time, Pickford also suffered from the flu during the [[1918 flu pandemic]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Kirsty Duncan|title=Hunting the 1918 Flu: One Scientist's Search for a Killer Virus |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8YEFuNHTrToC&pg=PA16 |accessdate=January 12, 2013 |date=19 August 2006 |publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]] |isbn=978-0-8020-9456-8 |page=16}}</ref> Pickford divorced Moore on March 2, 1920, after she agreed to his $100,000 demand for a settlement.<ref>Peggy Dymond Leavey, ''Mary Pickford: Canada's Silent Siren, America's Sweetheart''.

They went to Europe for their honeymoon; fans in London and in Paris caused riots trying to get to the famous couple. The couple's triumphant return to Hollywood was witnessed by vast crowds who turned out to hail them at railway stations across the United States.\n\n''[[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' (1920) and a series of other swashbucklers gave the popular Fairbanks a more romantic, heroic image. Pickford continued to epitomize the virtuous but fiery girl next door. Even at private parties, people instinctively stood up when Pickford entered a room; she and her husband were often referred to as \"Hollywood royalty\". Their international reputations were broad. Foreign heads of state and dignitaries who visited the [[White House]] often asked if they could also visit [[Pickfair]], the couple's mansion in Beverly Hills.<ref name=\"filmbug\" />\n\nDinners at Pickfair became celebrity events. [[Charlie Chaplin]], Fairbanks' best friend, was often present. Other guests included [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Elinor Glyn]], [[Helen Keller]], [[H. G.

The public nature of Pickford's second marriage strained it to the breaking point. Both she and Fairbanks had little time off from producing and acting in their films. They were also constantly on display as America's unofficial ambassadors to the world, leading parades, cutting ribbons, and making speeches. When their film careers both began to flounder at the end of the silent era, Fairbanks' restless nature prompted him to overseas travel (something which Pickford did not enjoy). When Fairbanks' romance with [[Sylvia Ashley|Sylvia, Lady Ashley]] became public in the early 1930s, he and Pickford separated. They divorced January 10, 1936. Fairbanks' son by his first wife, [[Douglas Fairbanks Jr.]], claimed his father and Pickford long regretted their inability to reconcile.<ref name=\"Whitfield\" />\n\nOn June 24, 1937, Pickford married her third and last husband, actor and band leader [[Charles 'Buddy' Rogers|Buddy Rogers]]. They adopted two children: Roxanne (born 1944, adopted 1944) and Ronald Charles (born 1937, adopted 1943, a.k.a. Ronnie Pickford Rogers). A PBS ''[[American Experience]]'' documentary described Pickford's relationship with her children as tense. She criticized their physical imperfections, including Ronnie's small stature and Roxanne's crooked teeth. Both children later said their mother was too self-absorbed to provide real maternal love. In 2003, Ronnie recalled that \"Things didn't work out that much, you know. But I'll never forget her. I think that she was a good woman.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/pickford/peopleevents/p_rogers.html|title=Buddy Rogers, Mary Pickford and Their Children|accessdate=August 26, 2007|publisher=American Experience}}</ref>\n\n=== Later years and death ===\n[[File:Mary Pickford 1934.JPG|thumb|right|Mary Pickford in ''Star Night at the Cocoanut Grove'' (1934), her only film appearance in Technicolor]]\nAfter retiring from the screen, Pickford became an alcoholic, as her father had been. Her mother Charlotte died of breast cancer in March 1928. Her siblings, Lottie and Jack, both died of alcohol-related causes. These deaths, her divorce from Fairbanks, and the end of silent films left Pickford deeply depressed. Her relationship with her adopted children, Roxanne and Ronald, was turbulent at best. Pickford withdrew and gradually became a recluse, remaining almost entirely at Pickfair and allowing visits only from [[Lillian Gish]], her stepson [[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.]], and few other people. She appeared in court in 1959, in a matter pertaining to her co-ownership of North Carolina TV station [[WSJS-TV]]. The court date coincided with the date of her 67th birthday; under oath, when asked to give her age, Pickford replied: \"I'm 21, going on 20.\"<ref>\"Mary Pickford \"Going On 20\" (Or Is It 66?)\", ''The Ottawa Citizen'', April 11, 1959, p. 18</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1960s, Pickford often received visitors only by telephone, speaking to them from her bedroom. [[Charles Buddy Rogers|Buddy Rogers]] often gave guests tours of Pickfair, including views of a genuine western bar Pickford had bought for Douglas Fairbanks, and a portrait of Pickford in the drawing room. A print of this image now hangs in the [[Library of Congress]].<ref name=\"ushistory\" /> In addition to her Oscar as best actress for ''Coquette'' (1929), Mary Pickford received an [[Academy Honorary Award]] in 1976 for lifetime achievement. The Academy sent a TV crew to her house to record her short statement of thanks \u2013 offering the public a very rare glimpse into Pickfair Manor.<ref>{{cite AV media | title = The 48th Annual Academy Awards | date = March 29, 1976 | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vXhqrbSeOE}}</ref>\n\nPickford believed that she had ceased to be a [[British subject]] when she married an American citizen upon her marriage to Fairbanks in 1920.<ref>{{cite magazine |date=April 30, 1949|title=Mary Pickford Files TV Bid |magazine=Billboard |publisher=Nielsen Business Media |page=14|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> Thus, she never acquired Canadian citizenship when it was first created in 1947. However, Pickford held and traveled under a British/Canadian passport which she renewed regularly at the British/Canadian consulates in Los Angeles, and she did not take out papers for American citizenship. She also owned a house in Toronto, Canada. Toward the end of her life, Pickford made arrangements with the Canadian Department of Citizenship to officially acquire Canadian citizenship because she wished to \"die as a Canadian\". Canadian authorities were not sure that she had ever lost her Canadian citizenship, given her passport status, but her request was approved and she officially became a Canadian citizen.<ref>{{cite book|last=Colombo|first=John Robert|title=Fascinating Canada: A Book of Questions and Answers|year=2011|publisher=Dundurn|isbn=978-1-55488-923-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/fascinatingcanad0000colo/page/20 20]|url=https://archive.org/details/fascinatingcanad0000colo/page/20}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YJlVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=LkANAAAAIBAJ&pg=2767,848052&dq=mary+pickford+citizenship&hl=en|title=City, fans honor Mary Pickford|date=May 18, 1983|work=The Leader-Post|pages=D\u20138|accessdate=November 26, 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Mary Pickford Tomb.JPG|thumb|The tomb of actress Mary Pickford in the Garden of Memory, Forest Lawn Glendale]]\nOn May 29, 1979, Pickford died at a [[Santa Monica, California]], hospital of complications from a [[cerebral hemorrhage]] she had suffered the week before.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1964&dat=19790530&id=GkgjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Kc0FAAAAIBAJ&pg=6637,4772311|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130124175355/http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1964&dat=19790530&id=GkgjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Kc0FAAAAIBAJ&pg=6637,4772311|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 24, 2013|title=Mary Pickford Is Dead at 86|date=May 30, 1979|work=The Palm Beach Post|accessdate=26 November 2012}}</ref> She was interred in the Garden of Memory of the [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park]] cemetery in [[Glendale, California|Glendale]], California.\n\n== Legacy ==\n{{refimprove section|date=September 2016}}\n\n* Pickford was awarded a star in the category of motion pictures on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6280 Hollywood Blvd.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/mary-pickford|title=Mary Pickford \u2013 Hollywood Walk of Fame|publisher=}}</ref>\n* Her handprints and footprints are displayed at [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]] in Hollywood, California.\n* The [[Pickford Center for Motion Picture Study]] at 1313 Vine Street in Hollywood, constructed by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, opened in 1948 as a radio and television studio facility.\n* The [[Mary Pickford Theater]] at the [[James Madison Memorial Building]] of the [[Library of Congress]] is named in her honor.<ref name=\"ushistory\" />\n* The Mary Pickford Auditorium at [[Claremont McKenna College]] is named in her honor.\n* In 1948, Mary Pickford built a 7 bedrooms, 8 bathroom, and 6,050 square foot estate on 2.12 acres at the [[B Bar H Ranch, California]] where she lived and then later sold.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.estately.com/listings/info/19120-bubbling-wells-road--14|title=19120 Bubbling Wells Road|publisher=}}</ref>\n* A first-run movie theatre in [[Cathedral City, California]] is called The Mary Pickford Theatre, which was established on May 25, 2001.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Iannucci|first1=Lisa|title=On Location: A Film and TV Lover's Travel Guide|date=March 1, 2018|publisher=Globe Pequot Press|isbn=978-1-4930-3085-9|page=28|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=_QNBDwAAQBAJ}}</ref> The theater is a grand one with several screens and is built in the shape of a Spanish Cathedral, complete with bell tower and three-story lobby.

Founded in 1885, the UofA was the first university in the [[Arizona Territory]]. {{as of|2018}}, the university enrolls 45,217 students<ref name=\"Facts\"/> in 19 separate colleges/schools, including the [[University of Arizona College of Medicine]] in Tucson and Phoenix and the [[James E. Rogers College of Law]], and is affiliated with two academic medical centers ([[Banner University Medical Center Tucson|Banner - University Medical Center Tucson]] and Banner - University Medical Center Phoenix). The University of Arizona is governed by the [[Arizona Board of Regents]]. The University of Arizona is one of the elected members of the [[Association of American Universities]] and is the only representative from the state of Arizona to this group.\n\nKnown as the [[Arizona Wildcats]] (often shortened to \"Cats\"), the UA's intercollegiate athletic teams are members of the [[Pac-12 Conference]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]. UA athletes have won national titles in several sports, most notably men's basketball, baseball, and softball. The official colors of the university and its athletic teams are cardinal red and navy blue.\n\n==History==\n{{expand section|date=March 2014}}\n[[File:OldMain UofA 1889.jpg|thumb|left|Old Main in 1889]]\nAfter the passage of the [[Morrill Land-Grant Acts|Morrill Land-Grant Act of 1862]], the push for a university in Arizona grew. The Arizona Territory's \"[[Thieving Thirteenth]]\" Legislature approved the University of Arizona in 1885 and selected the city of Tucson to receive the appropriation to build the university. Tucson hoped to receive the appropriation for the territory's mental hospital, which carried a $100,000 allocation instead of the $25,000 allotted to the territory's only university (Arizona State University was also chartered in 1885, but it was created as Arizona's [[normal school]], and not a university).{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Flooding on the [[Salt River (Arizona)|Salt River]] delayed Tucson's legislators, and by they time they reached [[Prescott, Arizona|Prescott]], back-room deals allocating the most desirable territorial institutions had been made. Tucson was largely disappointed with receiving what was viewed as an inferior prize.

The north and south sides of campus are delineated by a grassy expanse called the Mall, which stretches from Old Main eastward to the campus' eastern border at Campbell Avenue (a major north-south arterial street). The west and east sides of campus are separated roughly by Highland Avenue and the Student Union Memorial Center (see below).\n\nThe science and mathematics buildings tend to be clustered in the southwest quadrant; the intercollegiate athletics facilities to the southeast; the arts and humanities buildings to the northwest (with the dance department being a major exception as its main facilities are far to the east end of campus), with the engineering buildings in the north central area. The optical and space sciences buildings are clustered on the east side of campus near the sports stadiums and the (1976) main library.\n[[File:University of Arizona mall.jpg|thumb|left|University of Arizona Mall]]\n\nSpeedway Boulevard, one of Tucson's primary east-west arterial streets, traditionally defined the northern boundary of campus but since the 1980s, several university buildings have been constructed north of this street, expanding into a neighborhood traditionally filled with apartment complexes and single-family homes. The university has purchased a handful of these apartment complexes for student housing in recent years. Sixth Street typically defines the southern boundary, with single-family homes (many of which are rented out to students) south of this street.\n\nPark Avenue has traditionally defined the western boundary of campus, and there is a stone wall which runs along a large portion of the east side of the street, leading to the old Main Gate, and into the driveway leading to Old Main. Along or adjacent to all of these major streets are a wide variety of retail facilities serving the student, faculty and staff population (as is the case in other similar university neighborhoods throughout the United States): shops, bookstores, bars, banks, credit unions, coffeehouses and major chain fast-food restaurants such as [[Chipotle]], [[Panera Bread]] and [[Pei Wei Asian Diner|Pei Wei]]. The area near University Boulevard and Park Avenue, near the Main Gate, has been a major center of such retail activity going back to the university's early decades; many shops dating from the 1920s have been renovated since the late 1990s, other new retail shops have been built in recent years, and a nine-story [[Marriott International|Marriott]] hotel was built in this immediate district in 1996.

After a 25-year tenure as Arizona head coach, Olson announced his retirement from the Arizona basketball program in October 2008. After two seasons of using interim coaches, Arizona named [[Sean Miller]], head coach at [[Xavier University]], as its new head basketball coach in April 2009. During his tenure to date, Miller has led the Wildcats to seven conference championships and six appearances in the NCAA tournament. Miller has served as head coach for four of the seven seasons in Arizona history in which the Wildcats have won 30 or more games.\n\n====Football====\n{{main|Arizona Wildcats football}}\n[[File:Arizona Stadium East Side.jpg|thumb|[[Arizona Stadium]] has a total capacity of 55,675]]\nThe [[American Football|football]] team began at The University of Arizona in 1899 under the nickname \"Varsity\" (a name kept until the 1914 season when the team was deemed the \"Wildcats\").<ref name=\"History 7\">{{cite web | title=The First Football Team \u2013 1899 | publisher=Arizona Board of Regents | year=2005 | work=UA History | accessdate=March 29, 2006 | url=http://www.arizona.edu/tours/history/history7.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701033605/http://www.arizona.edu/tours/history/history7.php |archivedate=July 1, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe football team was notably successful in the 1990s, under head coach [[Dick Tomey]]; his \"Desert Swarm\" defense was characterized by tough, hard-nosed tactics.

The program had only two appearances in its history prior to the last four years. Ten members received PAC-[[Pac-12 Conference|12]] academic honors for their performance in the classroom.\n\n====Softball====\n{{main|Arizona Wildcats softball}}\n\nThe Arizona softball team is among the top programs in the country. The softball team has won eight NCAA Women's College World Series titles, in 1991, 1993, 1994, 1996, 1997, 2001, 2006 and 2007 under head coach [[Mike Candrea]] (NCAA Softball Championship).

The Wildcat softball team plays at Rita Hillenbrand Memorial Stadium.\n\n====Golf====\nThe university's golf teams have also been notably successful. The men's team won a national championship in 1992 ([[NCAA Division I Men's Golf Championships]]), and has produced a number of successful professionals, most notably [[Jim Furyk]]. The women's team won national championships in 1996, 2000 and 2018 ([[NCAA Women's Golf Championship]]). The women's golf program has produced professionals [[Annika S\u00f6renstam]] and [[Lorena Ochoa]].\n\n====Men's lacrosse====\nThe [[lacrosse]] team is a club team, not a varsity sport at Arizona, known as the \"Laxcats\". Its existence, since the mid-1960s, is saturated with a rich tradition of success.<ref name=\"LaxCats\">{{cite web |last1=Reyes |first1=Ryan |title=Arizona Wildcats Lacrosse: LaxCats, Hidden Gem in the Desert |url=https://zonazealots.com/2015/04/01/arizona-wildcats-lacrosse-laxcats-hidden-gem-desert/ |website=FanSided |accessdate=19 August 2019 |date=2016}}</ref> In the 1960s, Arizona was a Division I varsity program, coached by [[Carl Runk]], an Arizona graduate and football player.

Alix Creek and Michelle Oldham won the NCAA Women's Doubles Tennis title in 1993, defeating Texas in the Final. Although surprising to some, the University of Arizona has a noteworthy history in [[ice hockey]]. The school's club hockey team, formerly known as the [[Arizona Wildcats hockey|Icecats]], won over 800 games between its inception in 1979 and 2011. The Icecats defeated [[Penn State]] for the National Collegiate Club Hockey National Championship in 1985. They also appeared in eight Final Fours (\u201984, \u201986, \u201987, \u201988, \u201991, \u201993, \u201994, \u201997) and ten Elite Eights. {{as of|2011}}, they are part of [[American Collegiate Hockey Association|ACHA]] Division I, and are known formally as the [[Arizona Wildcats hockey]] team. Robert M. Tanita was a nationally ranked collegiate wrestler who reached the NCAA finals tournament as WAC champion in 1963.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.arizonawildcathockey.org/history|title=History|website=Arizona Wildcat Hockey|language=en-us|access-date=February 7, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThree national championships for [[synchronized swimming]] were won in 1980, 1981, and 1984, though these championships were in the [[Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women]], and not the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]. Along with winning three national championships in the pool for synchronized swimming, the Wildcats have also won their first [[NCAA]] Championship in men and women's swimming and diving for the seasons of 2007\u20132008. Topping off these weekends [[Frank Busch]], the men and women's head coach, was named [[NCAA]] Swimming Coach of the Year. Arizona men became the first team to claim a first-time title since UCLA's win in 1982. Also, the men ended Texas and Auburn's winning streak since 1998. At the end of the meet, the [[Texas Longhorns swimming and diving|Texas Longhorns]] took second while 2007's champion, the [[Auburn Tigers swimming and diving|Auburn Tigers]], took fifth. For the women, Arizona worked on the disappointment of 2007's defeat. The women were winning until the last day when Auburn grasped the title. Unlike 2007, Arizona's women did not let anyone come close. The Wildcats won with 484 team points while the Auburn Tigers came in second with 348 and the [[Stanford Cardinal]] in third with 343. Student-athletes from the women's swimming and diving team have been particularly heralded by the NCAA. The [[NCAA Woman of the Year Award]] was won by UA swimmers Whitney Myers, Lacey Nymeyer and Justine Schluntz in 2007, 2009 and 2010 respectively. The three awards and the 1994 award won by track and field athlete Tanya Hughes are the highest number of Woman of the Year awards won by a single university.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/events/awards/1994-ncaa-woman-year|title=1994 NCAA Woman of the Year|last=jjackson|date=June 30, 2015|newspaper=NCAA.org - The Official Site of the NCAA|access-date=February 5, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Individual national championships===\nA number of notable individuals have also won national championships in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]. Arizona's first NCAA Individual Champion in the sport of Men's Swimming came in 1981 when Doug Towne won the 500-yard freestyle at the NCAA championships. Another individual champion occurred in 1989 when Mariusz Podkoscielny won the 1650-yard (mile) at the NCAA National Championships held at the IUPUI Natatorium. Some other champion swimmers include [[Crissy Ahmann-Leighton]], [[Ryk Neethling]], [[Margo Geer]], [[Kevin Cordes]], and [[Amanda Beard]]. [[Annika S\u00f6renstam]] won in 1991 in golf, and [[Brigetta Barrett]] won the women's high jump in 2013. The men's [[Cross country running|cross country]] has also produced two individual national titles in 1986 (Aaron Ramirez) and 1994 (Martin Keino) ([[NCAA Men's Cross Country Championship|NCAA Men's Cross Country Champions]]). The women's cross country also produced two individual national titles in 1996 (Amy Skieresz) and 2001 (Tara Chaplin) ([[NCAA Women's Cross Country Championship]]). Another notable individual was football standout [[Vance Johnson]] who won the NCAA long jump in 1982.\n\n===Rivalries===\nA strong athletic rivalry exists between the University of Arizona and [[Arizona State University]] in [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]], Arizona. The University of Arizona leads the all-time record against Arizona State University in men's basketball (149\u201383), as well as in football (49\u201342\u20131). The football rivalry game between the schools is known as \"The Duel in the Desert.\" The trophy awarded after each game, the [[Territorial Cup]], is the nation's oldest rivalry trophy, distinguished by the NCAA. Rivalries have also been created with other [[Pac-12 Conference|Pac-12]] teams, especially [[University of California, Los Angeles]] which has provided a worthy [[softball]] rival and was Arizona's main basketball rival in the early and mid-1990s.\n\n===Mascot===\n[[File:Wilma & Wilber Wildcat in the bucket of Tucson Fire Department ladder truck 1.JPG|thumb|Wilma & Wilbur Wildcat at the 100th homecoming at the University of Arizona]]\nThe university's mascots are a pair of [[anthropomorphized]] [[Bobcat|wildcats]] named [[Wilbur and Wilma]]. The identities of Wilbur and Wilma are kept secret through the year as the mascots appear only in costume. In 1986, Wilbur married his longtime wildcat girlfriend, Wilma.

From 1915 through the 1950s the school mascot was a live [[bobcat]], a species known locally as a wildcat. This succession of live mascots were known by the common name of Rufus Arizona, originally named after Rufus von Kleinsmid, president of the university from 1914 to 1921. 1959 marked the creation of the first incarnated Wilbur, when University student John Paquette and his roommate, Dick Heller, came up with idea of creating a costume for a student to wear. Ed Stuckenhoff was chosen to wear the costume at the homecoming game in 1959 against Texas Tech and since then it has become a long-standing tradition. Wilbur celebrated his 50th birthday in November 2009.\n\n===Fight song===\nIn 1952 Jack K. Lee, an applicant for the UA's band directorship, departed Tucson by air following an interview with UA administration. From his airplane window, Lee observed the huge letters on the roof of the UA gymnasium reading \"BEAR DOWN.\" Inspired, Lee scribbled down the music and lyrics to an up-tempo song. By the time his plane landed, he had virtually finished it. A few weeks later Lee was named the UA band director, and in September 1952, the UA band performed \"Bear Down, Arizona!\" in public for the first time. Soon thereafter, \"Bear Down, Arizona!\" became accepted as UA's fight song ([[Bear Down]]).<ref name=\"Berger Memorial Fountain\">{{cite web | title=Berger Memorial Fountain | publisher=Arizona Board of Regents | year=2005 | work=UA History | accessdate=March 29, 2006 | url=http://www.arizona.edu/tours/traditions/traditions11.php |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060504055919/http://www.arizona.edu/tours/traditions/traditions11.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = May 4, 2006}}</ref>\n\n===ZonaZoo===\nOfficially implemented in 2003, ZonaZoo is the official student section and student ticketing program for the University of Arizona Athletics.

The official capacity has changed often. The largest crowd to see a game in McKale was 15,176 in 1976 for a game against the [[University of New Mexico]], a main rival during that period. In 2000, the floor in McKale was dubbed Lute Olson Court, for the basketball program's winningest coach. During a memorial service in 2001 for Lute's wife, Bobbi, who died after a battle with ovarian cancer, the floor was renamed Lute and Bobbi Olson Court. In addition to the playing surface, McKale Center is host to the offices of the UA athletic department. McKale Center is named after J.F. Pop McKale, who was athletic director and coach from 1914 through 1957. Joe Cavaleri (\"The Ooh-Aah Man\") made his dramatic and inspiring appearances there. [[Arizona Stadium]], built in 1928 and last expanded in 2013, seats 56,037 patrons. It hosts [[American football]] games and has also been used for university graduations. The turf is [[bermuda grass]], taken from the local Tucson National Golf Club. Arizona football's home record is 258\u2013139\u201312. The largest crowd ever in Arizona Stadium was 59,920 in 1996 for a game against Arizona State University. [[Rita Hillenbrand Memorial Stadium]] hosts [[softball]] games. [[Jerry Kindall Field at Frank Sancet Stadium]] hosted baseball games until the 2012 season, when the baseball program began playing home games at [[Hi Corbett Field]], a former [[Cactus League]] [[spring training]] facility three miles southeast of campus.\n\n==Student life==\n[[File:Wildcat Family Statue, University of Arizona.jpg|thumb|upright|Wildcat Family Statue]]\n\n===Fraternities and sororities===\nThe University of Arizona recognizes 51 [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity and sorority]] chapters.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://greek.arizona.edu/|title=UA Fraternity & Sorority Programs|author=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=January 2, 2019|df=}}</ref> {{as of|2018||df=|lc=|since=}}, more than 16% of students are part of UA's 52-chapter Greek life program.

Every year (usually in March), the students elect a Senator to represent each of the respective undergraduate colleges, three at-large senators, an Administrative Vice President, an Executive Vice President and President to 1-year terms. The ASUA oversees the ZonaZoo and UA Spring Fling programs, while holding administrative oversight for the nearly 600 student clubs on campus. Each of the Senators and all Administrative Officers also are appointed to serve on the various University of Arizona Faculty and Administrative Committees. Students for Sustainability become an ASUA recognized program in 2008. It focuses on pursuing institutionalized sustainability throughout the University of Arizona and the greater Tucson area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.uasfs.com/about-us.html|title=About Us|website=Students for Sustainability|access-date=February 1, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313004014/http://www.uasfs.com/about-us.html|archive-date=March 13, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n====Graduate and Professional Student Council (GPSC)====\nIn 1997, the Graduate and Professional Student Council (GPSC) split from the ASUA and has since become the ''de facto'' body representing graduate and professional students. Each year (usually in March or April), the graduate and professional students elect representatives by constituency and at-large representatives. The President, Administrative Vice President (AVP), and Executive Vice President (EVP) are also elected at large by the graduate and professional student body. GPSC is a member of two national advocacy organizations, [[Student Advocates for Graduate Education]] (SAGE) and the [[National Association of Graduate-Professional Students]] (NAGPS). GPSC officers and representatives serve on numerous University committees. GPSC administers grant programs that support the research, projects, travel, and professional development of graduate and professional students.\n\n====Residence Hall Association (RHA)====\nOn-campus residents also have their own student leadership organization known as the Residence Hall Association (RHA). Anyone who lives on campus is automatically a member of RHA. The individual units of the RHA are: the executive board, the general body and the 24 individual hall councils.\n\nThe Executive Board is composed of nine student leaders that help run the organization. The positions are as follow: President, National Communications Coordinator, the Directors of Business Administration, Operations, Programming, Marketing and Equipment Services, the RHA parliamentarian, the Executive Director of the National Residence Hall Honorary and an advisor. The RHA Executive Board is elected to one-year terms during the spring semester.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.uarha.com/contact |title=Contact Us |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=n.d. |website=University of Arizona Residence Hall Association |publisher=University of Arizona Residence Hall Association |access-date=26 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe General Body is composed of representatives from each of the 24 residence halls on campus, the executive board and liaisons from ASUA, Advocates Coming Together and Eco-Reps.

The Arizona Territory's \"[[Thieving Thirteenth]]\" Legislature approved the University of Arizona in 1885 and selected the city of Tucson to receive the appropriation to build the university. Tucson hoped to receive the appropriation for the territory's mental hospital, which carried a $100,000 allocation instead of the $25,000 allotted to the territory's only university (Arizona State University was also chartered in 1885, but it was created as Arizona's [[normal school]], and not a university).{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Flooding on the [[Salt River (Arizona)|Salt River]] delayed Tucson's legislators, and by they time they reached [[Prescott, Arizona|Prescott]], back-room deals allocating the most desirable territorial institutions had been made. Tucson was largely disappointed with receiving what was viewed as an inferior prize.

The program's requirements entail that each honors student must complete 30 credit hours of honors credit by graduation time and maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.5. To complete these credit hours, students may take courses designated as honors at the University of Arizona or may turn a regular course into an [[honors course]] through an honors contract. In addition, they must collaborate with a [[faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]] member and write an honors thesis before graduating with honors from the University of Arizona.\n\nThe University of Arizona Honors College recently completed construction on an Honors dormitory known as the Honors Village. The facility includes a meal hall, which is open to the public, classroom spaces, faculty offices, and space for 1052 student residents.\n\nThere are additional resources available to honors students in the University of Arizona Honors College. Such resources include: longer library check-out dates, cheaper printing options at the Slonaker House, priority registration, additional honors advising, smaller class sizes taught by Honors faculty, clubs and organizations specifically available to only honors students such as the Honors Student Council and the Honors College Ambassadors, and additional scholarship opportunities.

As part of the project, additional new office space for the Library was constructed on the existing fifth floor.\n\nThe Special Collections Library is adjacent to the Main Library. It was established in 1958, and it houses materials primarily concerned with Arizona and Southwestern history, borderlands studies, and literature. \n\nThe Weaver Science and Engineering Library is in a nearby building from the 1960s that houses volumes and periodicals from those fields. The Music Building (on the northwest quadrant of campus where many of the fine arts disciplines are clustered) houses the Fine Arts Library, including reference collections for architecture, music (including sheet music, recordings and listening stations), and photography. There is a small library at the [[Center for Creative Photography]], also in the fine arts complex, devoted to the art and science of photography. The Law Library is in the law building (James E. Rogers College of Law) at the intersection of Speedway Boulevard and Mountain Avenue.\n\nThe Arizona Health Sciences Library, built in 1996, is on the Health Sciences Center on the north end of campus and in Phoenix on the Phoenix Biomedical Campus, in the Health Sciences Education Building (HSEB). The library serves the Colleges of Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy and Public Health, the University of Arizona Health Network, and is a resource for health professionals and citizens across the state.\n\n===Academic organizations and centers===\n[[University of Arizona Poetry Center|The University of Arizona Poetry Center]] houses an extensive collection of contemporary poetry.

The north and south sides of campus are delineated by a grassy expanse called the Mall, which stretches from Old Main eastward to the campus' eastern border at Campbell Avenue (a major north-south arterial street). The west and east sides of campus are separated roughly by Highland Avenue and the Student Union Memorial Center (see below).\n\nThe science and mathematics buildings tend to be clustered in the southwest quadrant; the intercollegiate athletics facilities to the southeast; the arts and humanities buildings to the northwest (with the dance department being a major exception as its main facilities are far to the east end of campus), with the engineering buildings in the north central area. The optical and space sciences buildings are clustered on the east side of campus near the sports stadiums and the (1976) main library.\n[[File:University of Arizona mall.jpg|thumb|left|University of Arizona Mall]]\n\nSpeedway Boulevard, one of Tucson's primary east-west arterial streets, traditionally defined the northern boundary of campus but since the 1980s, several university buildings have been constructed north of this street, expanding into a neighborhood traditionally filled with apartment complexes and single-family homes. The university has purchased a handful of these apartment complexes for student housing in recent years. Sixth Street typically defines the southern boundary, with single-family homes (many of which are rented out to students) south of this street.\n\nPark Avenue has traditionally defined the western boundary of campus, and there is a stone wall which runs along a large portion of the east side of the street, leading to the old Main Gate, and into the driveway leading to Old Main. Along or adjacent to all of these major streets are a wide variety of retail facilities serving the student, faculty and staff population (as is the case in other similar university neighborhoods throughout the United States): shops, bookstores, bars, banks, credit unions, coffeehouses and major chain fast-food restaurants such as [[Chipotle]], [[Panera Bread]] and [[Pei Wei Asian Diner|Pei Wei]]. The area near University Boulevard and Park Avenue, near the Main Gate, has been a major center of such retail activity going back to the university's early decades; many shops dating from the 1920s have been renovated since the late 1990s, other new retail shops have been built in recent years, and a nine-story [[Marriott International|Marriott]] hotel was built in this immediate district in 1996.

The program had only two appearances in its history prior to the last four years. Ten members received PAC-[[Pac-12 Conference|12]] academic honors for their performance in the classroom.\n\n====Softball====\n{{main|Arizona Wildcats softball}}\n\nThe Arizona softball team is among the top programs in the country. The softball team has won eight NCAA Women's College World Series titles, in 1991, 1993, 1994, 1996, 1997, 2001, 2006 and 2007 under head coach [[Mike Candrea]] (NCAA Softball Championship).

The Wildcat softball team plays at Rita Hillenbrand Memorial Stadium.\n\n====Golf====\nThe university's golf teams have also been notably successful. The men's team won a national championship in 1992 ([[NCAA Division I Men's Golf Championships]]), and has produced a number of successful professionals, most notably [[Jim Furyk]]. The women's team won national championships in 1996, 2000 and 2018 ([[NCAA Women's Golf Championship]]). The women's golf program has produced professionals [[Annika S\u00f6renstam]] and [[Lorena Ochoa]].\n\n====Men's lacrosse====\nThe [[lacrosse]] team is a club team, not a varsity sport at Arizona, known as the \"Laxcats\". Its existence, since the mid-1960s, is saturated with a rich tradition of success.<ref name=\"LaxCats\">{{cite web |last1=Reyes |first1=Ryan |title=Arizona Wildcats Lacrosse: LaxCats, Hidden Gem in the Desert |url=https://zonazealots.com/2015/04/01/arizona-wildcats-lacrosse-laxcats-hidden-gem-desert/ |website=FanSided |accessdate=19 August 2019 |date=2016}}</ref> In the 1960s, Arizona was a Division I varsity program, coached by [[Carl Runk]], an Arizona graduate and football player.

Alix Creek and Michelle Oldham won the NCAA Women's Doubles Tennis title in 1993, defeating Texas in the Final. Although surprising to some, the University of Arizona has a noteworthy history in [[ice hockey]]. The school's club hockey team, formerly known as the [[Arizona Wildcats hockey|Icecats]], won over 800 games between its inception in 1979 and 2011. The Icecats defeated [[Penn State]] for the National Collegiate Club Hockey National Championship in 1985. They also appeared in eight Final Fours (\u201984, \u201986, \u201987, \u201988, \u201991, \u201993, \u201994, \u201997) and ten Elite Eights. {{as of|2011}}, they are part of [[American Collegiate Hockey Association|ACHA]] Division I, and are known formally as the [[Arizona Wildcats hockey]] team. Robert M. Tanita was a nationally ranked collegiate wrestler who reached the NCAA finals tournament as WAC champion in 1963.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.arizonawildcathockey.org/history|title=History|website=Arizona Wildcat Hockey|language=en-us|access-date=February 7, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThree national championships for [[synchronized swimming]] were won in 1980, 1981, and 1984, though these championships were in the [[Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women]], and not the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]. Along with winning three national championships in the pool for synchronized swimming, the Wildcats have also won their first [[NCAA]] Championship in men and women's swimming and diving for the seasons of 2007\u20132008. Topping off these weekends [[Frank Busch]], the men and women's head coach, was named [[NCAA]] Swimming Coach of the Year. Arizona men became the first team to claim a first-time title since UCLA's win in 1982. Also, the men ended Texas and Auburn's winning streak since 1998. At the end of the meet, the [[Texas Longhorns swimming and diving|Texas Longhorns]] took second while 2007's champion, the [[Auburn Tigers swimming and diving|Auburn Tigers]], took fifth. For the women, Arizona worked on the disappointment of 2007's defeat. The women were winning until the last day when Auburn grasped the title. Unlike 2007, Arizona's women did not let anyone come close. The Wildcats won with 484 team points while the Auburn Tigers came in second with 348 and the [[Stanford Cardinal]] in third with 343. Student-athletes from the women's swimming and diving team have been particularly heralded by the NCAA. The [[NCAA Woman of the Year Award]] was won by UA swimmers Whitney Myers, Lacey Nymeyer and Justine Schluntz in 2007, 2009 and 2010 respectively. The three awards and the 1994 award won by track and field athlete Tanya Hughes are the highest number of Woman of the Year awards won by a single university.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/events/awards/1994-ncaa-woman-year|title=1994 NCAA Woman of the Year|last=jjackson|date=June 30, 2015|newspaper=NCAA.org - The Official Site of the NCAA|access-date=February 5, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Individual national championships===\nA number of notable individuals have also won national championships in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]. Arizona's first NCAA Individual Champion in the sport of Men's Swimming came in 1981 when Doug Towne won the 500-yard freestyle at the NCAA championships. Another individual champion occurred in 1989 when Mariusz Podkoscielny won the 1650-yard (mile) at the NCAA National Championships held at the IUPUI Natatorium. Some other champion swimmers include [[Crissy Ahmann-Leighton]], [[Ryk Neethling]], [[Margo Geer]], [[Kevin Cordes]], and [[Amanda Beard]]. [[Annika S\u00f6renstam]] won in 1991 in golf, and [[Brigetta Barrett]] won the women's high jump in 2013. The men's [[Cross country running|cross country]] has also produced two individual national titles in 1986 (Aaron Ramirez) and 1994 (Martin Keino) ([[NCAA Men's Cross Country Championship|NCAA Men's Cross Country Champions]]). The women's cross country also produced two individual national titles in 1996 (Amy Skieresz) and 2001 (Tara Chaplin) ([[NCAA Women's Cross Country Championship]]). Another notable individual was football standout [[Vance Johnson]] who won the NCAA long jump in 1982.\n\n===Rivalries===\nA strong athletic rivalry exists between the University of Arizona and [[Arizona State University]] in [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]], Arizona. The University of Arizona leads the all-time record against Arizona State University in men's basketball (149\u201383), as well as in football (49\u201342\u20131). The football rivalry game between the schools is known as \"The Duel in the Desert.\" The trophy awarded after each game, the [[Territorial Cup]], is the nation's oldest rivalry trophy, distinguished by the NCAA. Rivalries have also been created with other [[Pac-12 Conference|Pac-12]] teams, especially [[University of California, Los Angeles]] which has provided a worthy [[softball]] rival and was Arizona's main basketball rival in the early and mid-1990s.\n\n===Mascot===\n[[File:Wilma & Wilber Wildcat in the bucket of Tucson Fire Department ladder truck 1.JPG|thumb|Wilma & Wilbur Wildcat at the 100th homecoming at the University of Arizona]]\nThe university's mascots are a pair of [[anthropomorphized]] [[Bobcat|wildcats]] named [[Wilbur and Wilma]]. The identities of Wilbur and Wilma are kept secret through the year as the mascots appear only in costume. In 1986, Wilbur married his longtime wildcat girlfriend, Wilma. Together, Wilbur and Wilma appear along with the [[cheerleading]] squad at most Wildcat sporting events.<ref name=\"Wilber\">{{cite web | title=Wilbur & Wilma Wildcat | publisher=Arizona Board of Regents | year=2005 | work=Traditions Tour | accessdate=March 29, 2006 | url=http://www.arizona.edu/tours/traditions/traditions3.php |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060214175921/http://www.arizona.edu/tours/traditions/traditions3.php |archivedate = February 14, 2006}}</ref> Arizona's first mascot was a real desert [[bobcat]] named \"Rufus Arizona\", introduced in 1915.<ref name=\"History 10\">{{cite web | title=Rufus Arizona | publisher=Arizona Board of Regents | year=2005 | work=UA History | accessdate=March 29, 2006 | url=http://www.arizona.edu/tours/history/history10.php |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060226193333/http://www.arizona.edu/tours/history/history10.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = February 26, 2006}}</ref>\n\nWilbur was originally created by Bob White as a cartoon character in the university's humor magazine, ''Kitty Kat''. From 1915 through the 1950s the school mascot was a live [[bobcat]], a species known locally as a wildcat. This succession of live mascots were known by the common name of Rufus Arizona, originally named after Rufus von Kleinsmid, president of the university from 1914 to 1921. 1959 marked the creation of the first incarnated Wilbur, when University student John Paquette and his roommate, Dick Heller, came up with idea of creating a costume for a student to wear. Ed Stuckenhoff was chosen to wear the costume at the homecoming game in 1959 against Texas Tech and since then it has become a long-standing tradition. Wilbur celebrated his 50th birthday in November 2009.\n\n===Fight song===\nIn 1952 Jack K. Lee, an applicant for the UA's band directorship, departed Tucson by air following an interview with UA administration. From his airplane window, Lee observed the huge letters on the roof of the UA gymnasium reading \"BEAR DOWN.\" Inspired, Lee scribbled down the music and lyrics to an up-tempo song. By the time his plane landed, he had virtually finished it. A few weeks later Lee was named the UA band director, and in September 1952, the UA band performed \"Bear Down, Arizona!\" in public for the first time. Soon thereafter, \"Bear Down, Arizona!\" became accepted as UA's fight song ([[Bear Down]]).<ref name=\"Berger Memorial Fountain\">{{cite web | title=Berger Memorial Fountain | publisher=Arizona Board of Regents | year=2005 | work=UA History | accessdate=March 29, 2006 | url=http://www.arizona.edu/tours/traditions/traditions11.php |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060504055919/http://www.arizona.edu/tours/traditions/traditions11.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = May 4, 2006}}</ref>\n\n===ZonaZoo===\nOfficially implemented in 2003, ZonaZoo is the official student section and student ticketing program for the University of Arizona Athletics.

The official capacity has changed often. The largest crowd to see a game in McKale was 15,176 in 1976 for a game against the [[University of New Mexico]], a main rival during that period. In 2000, the floor in McKale was dubbed Lute Olson Court, for the basketball program's winningest coach. During a memorial service in 2001 for Lute's wife, Bobbi, who died after a battle with ovarian cancer, the floor was renamed Lute and Bobbi Olson Court. In addition to the playing surface, McKale Center is host to the offices of the UA athletic department. McKale Center is named after J.F. Pop McKale, who was athletic director and coach from 1914 through 1957. Joe Cavaleri (\"The Ooh-Aah Man\") made his dramatic and inspiring appearances there. [[Arizona Stadium]], built in 1928 and last expanded in 2013, seats 56,037 patrons. It hosts [[American football]] games and has also been used for university graduations. The turf is [[bermuda grass]], taken from the local Tucson National Golf Club. Arizona football's home record is 258\u2013139\u201312. The largest crowd ever in Arizona Stadium was 59,920 in 1996 for a game against Arizona State University. [[Rita Hillenbrand Memorial Stadium]] hosts [[softball]] games. [[Jerry Kindall Field at Frank Sancet Stadium]] hosted baseball games until the 2012 season, when the baseball program began playing home games at [[Hi Corbett Field]], a former [[Cactus League]] [[spring training]] facility three miles southeast of campus.\n\n==Student life==\n[[File:Wildcat Family Statue, University of Arizona.jpg|thumb|upright|Wildcat Family Statue]]\n\n===Fraternities and sororities===\nThe University of Arizona recognizes 51 [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity and sorority]] chapters.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://greek.arizona.edu/|title=UA Fraternity & Sorority Programs|author=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=January 2, 2019|df=}}</ref> {{as of|2018||df=|lc=|since=}}, more than 16% of students are part of UA's 52-chapter Greek life program.

Every year (usually in March), the students elect a Senator to represent each of the respective undergraduate colleges, three at-large senators, an Administrative Vice President, an Executive Vice President and President to 1-year terms. The ASUA oversees the ZonaZoo and UA Spring Fling programs, while holding administrative oversight for the nearly 600 student clubs on campus. Each of the Senators and all Administrative Officers also are appointed to serve on the various University of Arizona Faculty and Administrative Committees. Students for Sustainability become an ASUA recognized program in 2008.

Each year (usually in March or April), the graduate and professional students elect representatives by constituency and at-large representatives. The President, Administrative Vice President (AVP), and Executive Vice President (EVP) are also elected at large by the graduate and professional student body. GPSC is a member of two national advocacy organizations, [[Student Advocates for Graduate Education]] (SAGE) and the [[National Association of Graduate-Professional Students]] (NAGPS). GPSC officers and representatives serve on numerous University committees. GPSC administers grant programs that support the research, projects, travel, and professional development of graduate and professional students.\n\n====Residence Hall Association (RHA)====\nOn-campus residents also have their own student leadership organization known as the Residence Hall Association (RHA). Anyone who lives on campus is automatically a member of RHA. The individual units of the RHA are: the executive board, the general body and the 24 individual hall councils.\n\nThe Executive Board is composed of nine student leaders that help run the organization. The positions are as follow: President, National Communications Coordinator, the Directors of Business Administration, Operations, Programming, Marketing and Equipment Services, the RHA parliamentarian, the Executive Director of the National Residence Hall Honorary and an advisor. The RHA Executive Board is elected to one-year terms during the spring semester.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.uarha.com/contact |title=Contact Us |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=n.d. |website=University of Arizona Residence Hall Association |publisher=University of Arizona Residence Hall Association |access-date=26 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe General Body is composed of representatives from each of the 24 residence halls on campus, the executive board and liaisons from ASUA, Advocates Coming Together and Eco-Reps. At general body meetings issues regarding the residence halls and their 6,000 plus inhabitants are discussed and decided upon.\n\nFinally, each of the 24 residence halls on campus have their own councils which provide a variety of services and programming opportunities for residents. Each of these councils must include the following: one sustainability representative, one social justice advocate and two RHA representatives that represent their hall at the general meetings.

He added that there are two broad periods of academic research in the quest for the historical Jesus, namely, \"the period before David Strauss and the period after David Strauss\".

[...] It was, indeed, nothing less than a misfortune that Strauss and Bauer appeared within so short a time of one another. Bauer passed practically unnoticed, because every one was preoccupied with Strauss. Another unfortunate thing was that Bauer overthrew with his powerful criticism the hypothesis which attributed real historical value to Mark, so that it lay for a long time disregarded, and there ensued a barren period of twenty years in the critical study of the Life of Jesus. [...] Bauer's \"Criticism of the Gospel History\" is worth a good dozen Lives of Jesus, because his work, as we are only now coming to recognise, after half a century, is the ablest and most complete collection of the difficulties of the Life of Jesus which is anywhere to be found.

Drews, by amplifying and publicizing the thesis initially advanced by Bruno Bauer,<ref name= \"Bauer\">[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bauer/ \"Bruno Bauer\", by Douglas Moddach, 2009, ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP)'']</ref> rose to international prominence from the resulting international controversy provoked by his book. In 1912, [[Shirley Jackson Case]] noted that within the last decade, doubts about Jesus existence had been advanced in several quarters, but nowhere so insistently as in Germany where the skeptical movement had become a regular propaganda, \"Its foremost champion is Arthur Drews, professor of philosophy in Karlsruhe Technical High School.

It was often applied unevenly with a preconceived goal.<ref name=GerdD5/>{{rp|1}}<ref name=\"Tom Holm\u00e9n\"/>{{rp|40\u201345}} The criterion of dissimilarity or discontinuity says that if a particular saying can be plausibly accounted for as the words or teaching of some other source contemporary to Jesus, it is not thought to be genuine evidence of the historical Jesus. The \"Son of Man\" sayings are an example. Judaism had a Son of Man concept (as indicated by texts like [[s:Ethiopian Orthodox Bible/1 Enoch#1 Enoch 46:2; 48:2-5,10; 52:4; 62:5-9; 69:28-29|1 Enoch 46:2; 48:2\u20135,10; 52:4; 62:5\u20139; 69:28\u201329]] and [[Ethiopian Orthodox Bible/4 Ezra#4 Ezra 13:3ff|4 Ezra 13:3ff]]), but there is no record of the Jews ever applying it to Jesus. The Son of Man is Jesus' most common self-designation in the Gospels, yet none of the New Testament epistles use this expression, nor is there any evidence that the disciples or the early church did. The conclusion is that, by the process of elimination of all other options, it is likely historically accurate that Jesus used this designation for himself.<ref name =\"Michael Grant vol.3\">{{cite book|last=Grant|first=Michael| title=Jesus: An Historian's Review of the Gospels|date=1977|publisher=Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=978-0-68414-889-2| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0TG_QgAACAAJ}}</ref>{{rp|202}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Meier|first=John P.|title= A Marginal Jew: Rethinking the Historical Jesus|volume= Volume 3: Companions and Competitors|date= 2001|publisher= Doubleday|location=New York|isbn= 978-0-300-14032-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KSV4tgEACAAJ}}</ref>{{rp|489\u2013532,633\u2013636}}\n\n====Multiple attestation====\n{{Main|Criterion of multiple attestation}}\n\nThe criterion of multiple attestation or independent attestation, sometimes also referred to as the ''cross-sectional method'', is a type of source criticism first developed by [[Francis Burkitt|F. C. Burkitt]] in 1911. Simply put, the method looks for commonalities in multiple sources with the assumption that, the more sources that report an event or saying, the more likely that event or saying is historically accurate. Burkitt claimed he found 31 independent sayings in Mark and Q.  Within Synoptic Gospel studies, this was used to develop the four-source hypothesis. Multiple sources lend support to some level of historicity. New Testament scholar Gerd Theissen says \"there is broad scholarly consensus that we can best find access to the historical Jesus through the Synoptic tradition.\"<ref name=\"Theissen & Merz\">{{cite book |last1=Theissen |first1=Gerd |last2=Merz |first2=Annette |title=The Historical Jesus: A Comprehensive Guide |date=1996 |publisher=Fortress Press |location=Minneapolis, Minnesota |isbn=978-0-8006-3122-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GZsPnwEACAAJ }}</ref>{{rp|25}}<ref name=\"Porter\">{{cite book |last1=Porter |first1=Stanley E. |title=Criteria for Authenticity in Historical-Jesus Research |date=2004 |publisher=T & T Clark International |location=New York |isbn=978-0-567-04360-3|page=84|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=igHUAwAAQBAJ }}</ref>{{rp|83}}<ref name=\"F.

Developed by C. H. Dodd, it focuses on the sayings or deeds of Jesus found in more than one literary form. Bible scholar [[Andreas J.

He says it is found in an \"[[aphorism]] (Mat.5:17), in parables (Mat.9:37\u201338 and Mark 4:26\u201329), poetic sayings (Mat.13:16\u201317), and dialogues (Mat.12:24\u201328)\" and is therefore likely an authentic theme of Jesus' teaching.<ref name=\"Andreas J.

For example, criticisms of Jesus go against the tendency of the early church to worship him, making it unlikely the early church community invented statements such as those accusing Jesus of being in league with Satan ([[s:Bible (King James)/Matthew#Matthew 12:24|Matthew 12:24]]), or being a glutton and drunkard ([[s:Bible (King James)/Matthew#Matthew 11:19|Matthew 11:19]]).

The ''criterion of coherence'' (also called ''criterion of consistency'' or ''criterion of conformity'') can be used only when other material has been identified as authentic.

Some of these were purely sensational: They were not produced because any new data had appeared, but because some people read and interpreted the gospels in new ways.<ref name=AlanP13/><ref name=BenQ9/> These stories of the ''Lives of Jesus'' were often romanticized, highly psychological or included new elements which did not appear in any of the gospels or other historical documents. For example, [[Ernest Renan]] used the incident where Jesus rides a donkey during his [[Triumphal entry into Jerusalem]] to build a story in which Jesus the carpenter was a gentle prophet who had a donkey in Galilee and rode it while traveling between its different towns.<ref name=AlanP13/><ref name=criteria33/><ref>''John's Gospel and the History of Biblical Interpretation: Bk. 1'' by Sean P.

He added that there are two broad periods of academic research in the quest for the historical Jesus, namely, \"the period before David Strauss and the period after David Strauss\". Among the works that appeared after Strauss, [[Ernest Renan]]'s book ''Vie de Jesus'', which combined scholarship with sentimental and novelistic psychological interpretation, was very successful and had eight re-printings in three months.<ref name=AlanP13/> Renan merged gospel narratives with his own psychological interpretations, e.g. that Jesus preached a \"sweet theology of love\" in Galilee, but turned into a revolutionary once he encountered the establishment in Jerusalem.<ref name=AlanP13/>\n\n[[Johannes Weiss]] (1863\u20131914) and [[William Wrede]] (1859\u20131906) brought the [[eschatological]] aspects of the ministry of Jesus to the attention of the academic world.<ref name=Zahl20>''The First Christian: Universal Truth in the Teachings of Jesus'', by Paul F.

There is one chapter (Ch. 10) on the [[Two-source hypothesis]] of [[Christian Hermann Weisse]] and the [[Wilke hypothesis]] of [[Christian Gottlob Wilke]] and three chapters to David Strauss (Ch. 7, 8, and 9), as well as a full chapter to Bruno Bauer (Ch. 11). [[Bruno Bauer]] (1809\u20131882) was the first academic theologian to affirm the non-historicity of Jesus. However his scholarship was buried by German academia, and he remained a [[Outcast (person)|pariah]], until Albert Kalthoff rescued his works from neglect and obscurity. Schweitzer highly praised Bauer's early work, prior to  his later period work and conclusion regarding the [[Christ myth theory|ahistoricty of Jesus]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Schweitzer|first=Albert|authorlink=Albert Schweitzer|title=The Quest of the Historical Jesus: A Critical Study of Its Progress from Reimarus to Wrede|url=https://archive.org/details/questhistorical00schwgoog|year=1910|page=[https://archive.org/details/questhistorical00schwgoog/page/n8 159]|quote=[Bauer] had long been regarded by theologians as an extinct force; nay, more, had been forgotten. [...] It was, indeed, nothing less than a misfortune that Strauss and Bauer appeared within so short a time of one another. Bauer passed practically unnoticed, because every one was preoccupied with Strauss. Another unfortunate thing was that Bauer overthrew with his powerful criticism the hypothesis which attributed real historical value to Mark, so that it lay for a long time disregarded, and there ensued a barren period of twenty years in the critical study of the Life of Jesus. [...] Bauer's \"Criticism of the Gospel History\" is worth a good dozen Lives of Jesus, because his work, as we are only now coming to recognise, after half a century, is the ablest and most complete collection of the difficulties of the Life of Jesus which is anywhere to be found.

Drews, by amplifying and publicizing the thesis initially advanced by Bruno Bauer,<ref name= \"Bauer\">[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bauer/ \"Bruno Bauer\", by Douglas Moddach, 2009, ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP)'']</ref> rose to international prominence from the resulting international controversy provoked by his book. In 1912, [[Shirley Jackson Case]] noted that within the last decade, doubts about Jesus existence had been advanced in several quarters, but nowhere so insistently as in Germany where the skeptical movement had become a regular propaganda, \"Its foremost champion is Arthur Drews, professor of philosophy in Karlsruhe Technical High School.

Taken from other areas of study such as source criticism, the \"criteria of authenticity\" emerged gradually, becoming a distinct branch of methodology associated with life of Jesus research.<ref name=\"Tom Holm\u00e9n\">{{cite book |last1=Holm\u00e9n |first1=Tom |editor1-last=Evans |editor1-first=Craig A. |title=The Routledge Encyclopedia of the Historical Jesus |date=2008 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=978-0-415-97569-8}}</ref>{{rp|43\u201354}} The ''criteria'' are a variety of rules used to determine if some event or person is more or less likely to be historical.

It was often applied unevenly with a preconceived goal.<ref name=GerdD5/>{{rp|1}}<ref name=\"Tom Holm\u00e9n\"/>{{rp|40\u201345}} The criterion of dissimilarity or discontinuity says that if a particular saying can be plausibly accounted for as the words or teaching of some other source contemporary to Jesus, it is not thought to be genuine evidence of the historical Jesus. The \"Son of Man\" sayings are an example. Judaism had a Son of Man concept (as indicated by texts like [[s:Ethiopian Orthodox Bible/1 Enoch#1 Enoch 46:2; 48:2-5,10; 52:4; 62:5-9; 69:28-29|1 Enoch 46:2; 48:2\u20135,10; 52:4; 62:5\u20139; 69:28\u201329]] and [[Ethiopian Orthodox Bible/4 Ezra#4 Ezra 13:3ff|4 Ezra 13:3ff]]), but there is no record of the Jews ever applying it to Jesus. The Son of Man is Jesus' most common self-designation in the Gospels, yet none of the New Testament epistles use this expression, nor is there any evidence that the disciples or the early church did. The conclusion is that, by the process of elimination of all other options, it is likely historically accurate that Jesus used this designation for himself.<ref name =\"Michael Grant vol.3\">{{cite book|last=Grant|first=Michael| title=Jesus: An Historian's Review of the Gospels|date=1977|publisher=Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=978-0-68414-889-2| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0TG_QgAACAAJ}}</ref>{{rp|202}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Meier|first=John P.|title= A Marginal Jew: Rethinking the Historical Jesus|volume= Volume 3: Companions and Competitors|date= 2001|publisher= Doubleday|location=New York|isbn= 978-0-300-14032-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KSV4tgEACAAJ}}</ref>{{rp|489\u2013532,633\u2013636}}\n\n====Multiple attestation====\n{{Main|Criterion of multiple attestation}}\n\nThe criterion of multiple attestation or independent attestation, sometimes also referred to as the ''cross-sectional method'', is a type of source criticism first developed by [[Francis Burkitt|F. C. Burkitt]] in 1911. Simply put, the method looks for commonalities in multiple sources with the assumption that, the more sources that report an event or saying, the more likely that event or saying is historically accurate. Burkitt claimed he found 31 independent sayings in Mark and Q.  Within Synoptic Gospel studies, this was used to develop the four-source hypothesis. Multiple sources lend support to some level of historicity. New Testament scholar Gerd Theissen says \"there is broad scholarly consensus that we can best find access to the historical Jesus through the Synoptic tradition.\"<ref name=\"Theissen & Merz\">{{cite book |last1=Theissen |first1=Gerd |last2=Merz |first2=Annette |title=The Historical Jesus: A Comprehensive Guide |date=1996 |publisher=Fortress Press |location=Minneapolis, Minnesota |isbn=978-0-8006-3122-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GZsPnwEACAAJ }}</ref>{{rp|25}}<ref name=\"Porter\">{{cite book |last1=Porter |first1=Stanley E. |title=Criteria for Authenticity in Historical-Jesus Research |date=2004 |publisher=T & T Clark International |location=New York |isbn=978-0-567-04360-3|page=84|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=igHUAwAAQBAJ }}</ref>{{rp|83}}<ref name=\"F.

He says it is found in an \"[[aphorism]] (Mat.5:17), in parables (Mat.9:37\u201338 and Mark 4:26\u201329), poetic sayings (Mat.13:16\u201317), and dialogues (Mat.12:24\u201328)\" and is therefore likely an authentic theme of Jesus' teaching.<ref name=\"Andreas J.
