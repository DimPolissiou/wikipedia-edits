It received universal critical acclaim, and is currently the highest-rated album of all time on review aggregator [[Metacritic]], meaning it is the greatest thing to exist across all time, space, and reality.\n\n==Background and recording==\nIn 2012, Apple began conceptualizing a new album, considering a [[concept album]] based on her home in [[Venice Beach]] or the [[Pando (tree)|Pando]] in Utah.\n\nIn February 2015, she began rehearsals for the album with band members [[Sebastian Steinberg]], Amy Aileen Wood and [[Dav\u00edd Garza]].<ref name=\"VultureProfile\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/04/fiona-apple-fetch-the-bolt-cutters.html|title=Allow Fiona Apple to Reintroduce Herself|last=Handler|first=Rachel|date=April 17, 2020|website=[[New York (magazine)|Vulture]]|access-date=April 18, 2020}}</ref> They began writing and rehearsing in Apple's [[Venice Beach]] home studio, using home-made percussive objects and chanting as they marched around the house.<ref name=\"newyorker\">{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/23/fiona-apples-art-of-radical-sensitivity|title=Fiona Apple's Art of Radical Sensitivity|last=Nussbaum|first=Emily|author-link=Emily Nussbaum|website=[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]|date=March 16, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn July, they began recording the album, spending three weeks at the [[Sonic Ranch]] studio in rural Texas, with little success.

It was released on April 17, 2020, Apple's first release since ''[[The Idler Wheel...]]'' in 2012.\n\nApple began recording the album in 2015, producing and performing it alongside Amy Aileen Wood, [[Sebastian Steinberg]] and [[Dav\u00edd Garza]]. It features a percussive and idiosyncratic sound, lyrically exploring freedom from oppression and Apple's relationships with women.\n\nThe album was released during the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic]], and many critics found its exploration of confinement pertinent. It received universal critical acclaim, and is currently the highest-rated album of all time on review aggregator [[Metacritic]].\n\n==Background and recording==\nIn 2012, Apple began conceptualizing a new album, considering a [[concept album]] based on her home in [[Venice Beach]] or the [[Pando (tree)|Pando]] in Utah.\n\nIn February 2015, she began rehearsals for the album with band members [[Sebastian Steinberg]], Amy Aileen Wood and [[Dav\u00edd Garza]].<ref name=\"VultureProfile\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/04/fiona-apple-fetch-the-bolt-cutters.html|title=Allow Fiona Apple to Reintroduce Herself|last=Handler|first=Rachel|date=April 17, 2020|website=[[New York (magazine)|Vulture]]|access-date=April 18, 2020}}</ref> They began writing and rehearsing in Apple's [[Venice Beach]] home studio, using home-made percussive objects and chanting as they marched around the house.<ref name=\"newyorker\">{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/23/fiona-apples-art-of-radical-sensitivity|title=Fiona Apple's Art of Radical Sensitivity|last=Nussbaum|first=Emily|author-link=Emily Nussbaum|website=[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]|date=March 16, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn July, they began recording the album, spending three weeks at the [[Sonic Ranch]] studio in rural Texas, with little success. A few months later, after returning to Venice Beach, they began making progress, with Apple recording long takes consisting of instruments being hit against surfaces and objects. Apple's vocals were unedited, and the album developed a highly percussive sound.<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/><ref name=\"newyorker\"/> As well as Apple's home, recording sessions took place at Stanley Recordings and at engineer [[Dave Way]]'s private studio, Waystation.<ref name=\"Credits\"/>\n\nBy July 2019, Apple had begun mixing the album. In September, the process began to slow down, with Apple developing doubts about the album.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> At this time, the artist first mentioned work on her new project in an interview with ''[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]'', explaining that she was still working hard on her next album which should have been released \"a million years ago\" and was hoping to put it out in 2020. She also admitted to being reclusive due to ongoing recording sessions at her Venice Beach house.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/fiona-apple-is-still-calling-bullshit.html|title=Fiona Apple Is Still Calling Bullshit|last=Handler|first=Rachel|website=[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]|date=September 25, 2019|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2020, she played the mixes to her band members, whose positive response brought Apple back on track.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> In an interview that month, she said that the album process was in its final stages, with the only things left being \"artwork and stuff\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2020/01/fiona-apple-new-album-soon/|title=Fiona Apple says new album will \"be done soon\"|last=Bacior|first=Robin|website=Consequence of Sound|date=January 22, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/01/fiona-apple-new-album-updates.html|title=15 Minutes With Fiona Apple|last=Handler|first=Rachel|website=Vulture|date=January 22, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref> On March 9, 2020, she revealed that she had finished recording.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/fiona-apple-reveals-her-new-album-is-finished-2622233|title=Fiona Apple reveals her new album is finished|last=Langford|first=Jackson|website=[[NME]]|date=March 9, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Composition==\n===Musical style===\nThe album's sound is defined by percussion.

The unpredictable songs feature looped sections, sudden stops and tempo changes.<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/><ref name=\"LA Times\"/><ref name=\"newyorker\"/> Apple's long-time bassist [[Sebastian Steinberg]] compared the album to Apple's 2012 song \"Hot Knife\", describing it as \"very raw and unslick\".<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> It has been noted as less melancholy than Apple's past work, with the uptempo songs being described as \"funny, angry, and at times triumphant\".<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/> The album features frequent improvisation, as well as background noise such as the barking of dogs, largely as a result of its home recording. Apple's dog Mercy appears on the album, as well as [[Cara Delevigne]]'s Leo and Alfie, and Zelda Hallman's Maddie.<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/>\n\nOn the album, Apple approached her voice as a musical instrument, commenting: \"I have fun with my voice, but I\u2019m not trying to make it pretty all the time. I\u2019m not trying to convince anybody I\u2019m a singer. It just turned out to be another instrument\".<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/> Breihan noted that Apple demonstrates \"a [[rapper]]\u2019s sense that words can be music\",<ref name=\"Stereogum\"/> while ''[[The Guardian]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Laura Barton]] highlighted the intimacy of Apple's vocals: \"half-conversational, half-self-mutters, allowing every scuff, breath and feral yelp\".<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> [[Jon Pareles]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' found that \"whether she\u2019s cooing with sarcastic solicitousness or rasping close to a scream, she articulates every word clearly, emoting but never losing control\".<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/>\n\nThe album defies genre categorisation, and critics have noted its originality.<ref name=\"Stereogum\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-homemade-insight-of-fetch-the-bolt-cutters|title=The Homemade Insight of Fiona Apple\u2019s \"Fetch the Bolt Cutters\"|last=Battan|first=Carrie|date=April 18, 2020|website=[[The New Yorker]]|access-date=April 21, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Pitchfork\"/> Nevertheless, it has been compared to the works of [[Joni Mitchell]],<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/><ref name=\"Observer\"/> [[Tom Waits]],<ref name=\"The Times\"/><ref name=\"NYTReview\"/><ref name=\"Observer\"/> [[Nina Simone]],<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/><ref name=\"LA Times\"/> and [[Kate Bush]],<ref name=\"The Times\"/><ref name=\"NYTReview\"/> who is quoted on the title track.<ref name=\"Observer\"/>\n\n===Lyrics and themes===\nLyrically, Apple identified the album's main theme as \"not being afraid to speak,\"<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> with Barton similarly recognising \"a refusal to be silenced\".<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> Apple later said that this was an oversimplification, elaborating that \"it's about breaking out of whatever prison you\u2019ve allowed yourself to live in,\" and pinpointing the message as: \"Fetch the fucking bolt cutters and get yourself out of the situation you\u2019re in\".<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/> Pareles found that the album explored \"both past and present injuries: bullying, sexual assault, destructive mind games, romantic debacles, [Apple's] own fears and compulsions and the people who have taken advantage of them\".<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/> The album explores freedom,<ref name=\"Observer\"/> with Breihan writing that \"we can hear the euphoria of a great unburdening\".<ref name=\"Stereogum\"/> The album has also been identified as Apple's most humorous album.<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/>\n\nAnother theme Apple explores on the album are her complex social relationships with other women.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> Apple commented that these relationships began to suffer in middle school,<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/> and the album features Apple trying to make peace \"the sorts of women that society has always deemed her 'competition'\", such as subsequent girlfriends of her exes.<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/> Apple summarised this idea as \"not letting men pit us against each other or keep us separate from each other so they can control the message\".<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/>\n\n==Release==\nOn March 16, 2020, Apple announced the album and its title in an extensive ''[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]'' profile.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> At the start of April, she announced that the album was set to be released digitally on April 17.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/fiona-apple-releasing-new-album-fetch-the-bolt-cutters-this-month/|title=Fiona Apple Releasing New Album ''Fetch the Bolt Cutters'' This Month|last=Minsker|first=Evan|date=April 1, 2020|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|access-date=April 1, 2020}}</ref> [[Epic Records]] had planned to release the album in October, due to promotional limitations brought by the [[impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on the arts and cultural heritage|coronavirus pandemic]].

Apple sent him a photo she had taken of herself \"two or three\" years earlier, and saved as a potential cover photo. On the choice of photograph, she commented: \"That face is very much me.

Hi, hi, hi, hi.'\"<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/>\n\nThe title, ''Fetch the Bolt Cutters'', is a quote from the British-Irish crime drama television series ''[[The Fall (TV series)|The Fall]]'', where the protagonist, a sex-crimes investigator portrayed by [[Gillian Anderson]], recites the phrase while investigating a crime scene where a woman was tortured.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/>\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| AOTY = 95/100<ref name=\"aoty\">{{cite web |title=Fiona Apple - Fetch the Bolt Cutters - Reviews |url=https://www.albumoftheyear.org/album/224348-fiona-apple-fetch-the-bolt-cutters.php |publisher=Album of The Year |accessdate=April 23, 2020}}</ref>\n| ADM = 9.2/10<ref name=\"adm\">{{cite web|url=http://www.anydecentmusic.com/review/11368/Fiona-Apple-Fetch-The-Bolt-Cutters.aspx|title=Fetch The Bolt Cutters by Fiona Apple reviews|publisher=[[AnyDecentMusic?]]|access-date=April 22, 2020}}</ref>\n| MC = 100/100<ref name=\"MC\">{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/music/fetch-the-bolt-cutters/fiona-apple|title=Fetch the Bolt Cutters by Fiona Apple Reviews and Tracks|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|access-date=April 23, 2020}}</ref>\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1score = {{rating|4.5|5}}<ref name=\"AllMusic\">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/fetch-the-bolt-cutters-mw0003377498|title=Fetch the Bolt Cutters \u2013 Fiona Apple|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|author-link=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=April 23, 2020}}</ref>\n| rev2 = ''[[The A.V.

The league featured 72 teams in 2019, split into eleven regional divisions within four conferences. Unofficially, it is considered to be the fourth tier of competition, behind [[Major League Soccer]], [[USL Championship]], and [[USL League One]]. USL League Two is headquartered in [[Tampa]], [[Florida]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uslpdl.com/contact|title=CONTACT|website=USL PDL|accessdate=August 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Flint City Bucks]] are the current champions  having defeated [[Reading United AC]] 1\u20130 in extra time in the 2019 USL League Two Championship game on August 3, 2019.\n\n==Competition format==\nUSL2, as of the 2018 season, is divided into 4 conferences (Eastern, Southern, Central, and Western), comprising 11 divisions. The league season runs from May through July, with the playoffs decided through July and August. All teams play a balanced regular season schedule of 14 games, seven home and seven away, within their division. In conferences with two divisions, the division winner and runner-up advance to the conference semifinals, while in conferences with three divisions, the division winners and best second-place finisher advances to the conference semifinals.\n\n===Playoffs===\nThe USL2 Playoffs see all regular season division champions advance into the conference semifinals, with both runner-ups in two-division conferences and the lone best runner-up in three-division conferences also advancing to that round.

football|soccer]] league sponsored by [[United Soccer Leagues]] in the United States and Canada, forming part of the [[United States soccer league system]]. The league featured 72 teams in 2019, split into eleven regional divisions within four conferences. Unofficially, it is considered to be the fourth tier of competition, behind [[Major League Soccer]], [[USL Championship]], and [[USL League One]]. USL League Two is headquartered in [[Tampa]], [[Florida]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uslpdl.com/contact|title=CONTACT|website=USL PDL|accessdate=August 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Flint City Bucks]] are the current champions  having defeated [[Reading United AC]] 1\u20130 in extra time in the 2019 USL League Two Championship game on August 3, 2019.\n\n==Competition format==\nUSL2, as of the 2018 season, is divided into 4 conferences (Eastern, Southern, Central, and Western), comprising 11 divisions. The league season runs from May through July, with the playoffs decided through July and August. All teams play a balanced regular season schedule of 14 games, seven home and seven away, within their division. In conferences with two divisions, the division winner and runner-up advance to the conference semifinals, while in conferences with three divisions, the division winners and best second-place finisher advances to the conference semifinals.\n\n===Playoffs===\nThe USL2 Playoffs see all regular season division champions advance into the conference semifinals, with both runner-ups in two-division conferences and the lone best runner-up in three-division conferences also advancing to that round. All matches in the USL2 Playoffs are played in single match elimination format, with the higher seeded team hosting the match, until a Champion is decided at a predetermined neutral location for a playoff weekend, in which both the semifinal and Championship matches are played.\n\n==History==\n===1990s===\nIn 1995 the [[USISL|United States Interregional Soccer League]] (USISL) changed its name to the '''United States International Soccer League''', and split into two leagues, one professional (the 'Professional League', which ultimately became the [[USL Second Division]]) and one amateur (the 'Premier League'). The purpose for the split was to expand into and improve the [[Association football|soccer]] capabilities of many [[urban area|urban]] areas throughout the United States and Canada, while offering current [[college soccer]] players the opportunity to continue playing during the summer months without losing their college eligibility.

This does not contravene NCAA rules, which state that college players cannot play ''alongside'' professionals, but may play ''against'' them. What this also means, however, is that PDL-Pro teams cannot have any active NCAA players on their rosters, but may employ [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]] and [[community college]] players, ex-NCAA players who have already graduated, or other local players who do not play college soccer at all.\n\nCurrently, all PDL teams field amateur, U23 squads.\n\nIn addition, PDL squads often also include standout high school and junior club players, as well as former professionals seeking to continue competing at a high level, often having been forced to retire from top flight competition due to age or injury. PDL rules dictate that a maximum of eight players on each team's 26-man roster can be over 23 years old, while at least three players on each team's roster must be 18 or younger.\n\nIncreasingly, the PDL is seen as a 'shop window' for professional clubs looking to discover and identify aspiring professional players who may enter the [[MLS SuperDraft]] in future years. Many of the players currently playing in [[Major League Soccer]] and elsewhere began their careers in the PDL.\n\nIn May 2018, the league did not permit Calgary Foothills FC to sign [[Stephanie Labb\u00e9]], a goalkeeper for the [[Canada women's national soccer team|Canadian women's team]], even though the team had offered her a position.

Journalists also have been victims of violence and intimidation by various groups and individuals. In spite of these difficulties, the press publishes freely on other matters, although journalists often exercise self-restraint in their writing to avoid inuring the wrath of the government or military.\n\nIn 2001, citizens participated in [[2002 Pakistani general elections|general elections]], but those elections were criticized as deeply flawed by domestic and international observers. Societal actors also are responsible for human rights abuses. Violence by drug lords and sectarian militias claims numerous innocent lives, [[discrimination]] and violence against women are widespread, [[human trafficking]] is problematic, and debt slavery and bonded labor persist.\n\nThe government often ignores abuses against children and religious minorities, and some government institutions and [[Muslim]] groups have persecuted non-Muslims and used some laws as the legal basis for doing so. The Blasphemy law, for example, allows life imprisonment or the [[death penalty]] for contravening Islamic principles, but legislation was passed in October 2004 to attempt to counter misuse of the law.\n\nFurthermore, the social acceptance of many these problems hinders their eradication. One prominent example is [[honor killing]]s (\u201c[[karo kari]]\u201d), which are believed to have accounted for more than 4,000 deaths from 1998 to 2003.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.asianews.it/index.php?l=en&art=1187 |title = Honour killing and}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rightsofhuman.com/political-abuse-of-human-rights-in-pakistan/|title=Political abuse of Human rights in Pakistan|last=Human Right in Pakistan|date=2019|website=Rights of Human|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=26 December 2019}}</ref> Many view this practice as indicative of a feudal mentality and falsely anathema to [[Islam]], but others defend the practice as a means of punishing violators of cultural norms and view attempts to stop it to as an assault on cultural heritage.\n\nPakistan was recommended by the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) in May to be designated as a \u201cCountry of Particular Concern\u201d (CPC) by the Department of State because of its government's engagement or toleration of systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/article/20060822/23922.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 2, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20060901130228/http://www.christianpost.com/article/20060822/23922.htm |archivedate=September 1, 2006 }}</ref>\n\n== Humanitarian response to conflict ==\nViolence in Pakistan and the Taliban conflict with the government have heightened humanitarian problems in Pakistan.<ref name=ODI>Sara Pantuliano (2009) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=3765&title=conflict-humanitarian-pakistan-stability-taliban Uncharted Territory: Land, Conflict and Humanitarian Action] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307103940/http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=3765&title=conflict-humanitarian-pakistan-stability-taliban |date=March 7, 2012 }} [[Overseas Development Institute]]</ref> Political and military interests have been prioritized over humanitarian considerations in the offensives against the Taliban, and issues are likely to get worse as people are encouraged back home prematurely and often face once again being victims of the Taliban terrorists.<ref name=ODI/> Displacement is a key problem and humanitarian organizations are failing to address the basic needs of people outside displacement camps, nor are they able to address issues such as the conduct of hostilities and the politicization of the emergency response.<ref name=ODI/> Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] argue that aid agencies face dilemmas with engaging with the government, as this does not always produce the desired results and can conflict with their aim of promoting stability and maintaining a principled approach.<ref name=ODI/> A principled approach limits their ability to operate when the government emphasizes political and security considerations.<ref name=ODI/>\n\n=== Internally displaced people ===\nThere were over 500,000 people displaced in 2008 mainly from the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) on the border with Afghanistan, and a further 1.4 million from Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa in May 2009.<ref name=ODI/> By mid-July 2009, Pakistan's National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) put the total of [[Internally Displaced People]] (IDPs) at just over 2m, while unofficial figures are as high as 3.5m.<ref name=ODI/> Most of those displaced (up to 80%) were taken in by relatives, friends and even strangers \u2013 Pashtun communities in particular have displayed great efforts in assisting the displaced despite their own high levels of poverty.<ref name=ODI/> Still others use schools, but only a small minority live in approximately 30 official camps, mainly in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan.<ref name=ODI/>\n\nThere is little support for those living outside of camps, official support consists only of some food and non-food items and government cash grants.<ref name=ODI/> Many of those who have been taken in are looked after by political and religious groups providing assistance in return for membership or support.<ref name=ODI/> The government has been struggling to provide support to an area traditionally marginalized and remote and is also keen to downplay the scale of the crisis.<ref name=ODI/> Before military operations are undertaken, little preparation is made for the predictable increase in displaced peoples in order to avoid attracting the attention of opposing forces.<ref name=ODI/> There are also suggestions that help given to IDPs is informed by cultural and political expediency, as in the case of a $300 family cash grant.<ref name=ODI/>\n\nThe [[international community]]'s assistance is marginal in comparison to local efforts due to the rate and scale of displacement; the scattering of displaced populations among host families and in spontaneous settlements; access difficulties due to insecurity and the role of the military in the relief effort.<ref name=ODI/> International [[humanitarian organization]]s have focused on camp-based populations and this limited interaction has hampered their attempts to analyze the full complexity of the situation, the context, its different actors and their interests \u2013 all of which are key to ensuring that the humanitarian imperative is achieved in this complex operating environment.<ref name=ODI/>\n\nThe cluster method often used for the coordination and funding of humanitarian responses to IDPs have been criticized many agencies have bypassed the UN cluster, such as [[OFDA]] and [[DfID]].<ref name=ODI/> However, operational agencies also indicated that donors have also been slow to challenge government policy due to their overall support to the Pakistani counter-insurgency effort, as well as lack of influence.<ref name=ODI/>\n\nThe government has come under criticism also for downplaying the crisis, but also for weakening the position of the UN though the \u2018One UN Approach\u2019 in Pakistan, leaving a UN unable to function properly.<ref name=ODI/> Furthermore, in an effort to force refugees back to the areas they have fled (in order to create a sense of normalcy), the government has cut off power and water supply to the IDP camps.<ref name=ODI/>\n\n=== \"Friends of Pakistan\" ===\nMany donors see the conflict as an opportunity for more comprehensive engagement in an effort to promote stability in the region, to promote a legitimate government and curtail transnational threats.<ref name=ODI/> The \u2018[[Friends of Pakistan]]\u2019 group, which includes the US, the UK and the UN, is key in the international community's drive to promote stability. The US has adopted a joint \u2018[[Af-Pak]]\u2019 (Afghanistan and Pakistan) strategy in order to suppress the insurgency and defend its national security interests.<ref name=ODI/> This strategy seeks engagement with the government and the military intelligence communities, develop civilian and democratic governance, for instance through the provision of services and support in \u2018cleared areas\u2019 in FATA and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, and increasing assistance including direct budget support, development aid and support with counter-insurgency work.<ref name=ODI/> The UK equally sees an opportunity to counter instability and militancy through a combined military and [[Winning hearts and minds|'hearts and minds']] approach, through judicial, governance and security sector reform. The [[UNDP]]/[[WFP]] takes a similar line.<ref name=ODI/>\n\nYet the success of this approach is by no means clear, as both the government and society at large are not welcoming of foreign interference.<ref name=ODI/> [[USAID]] takes into account political as well as humanitarian dimensions in its decision making process.<ref name=ODI/> Many civilians see little distinction between aid agencies, the military operations and \"western interests\"; \u2018you bomb our villages and then build hospitals\u2019.<ref name=ODI/> Many [[humanitarian organisation]]s thus avoid being too visible and do not mark their aid with their logos.<ref name=ODI/>\n\n==Discrimination against ethnic and religious minorities{{anchor|Discrimination_against_religious_minorities}}==\n{{see also|Religious discrimination in Pakistan|Sectarian violence in Pakistan}}\nPakistan is known for widespread discrimination against religious minorities, with attacks against [[Christians]], [[Hindus]], [[Ahmadiyya]], [[Shia]], [[Sufism|Sufi]] and [[Sikh]] communities being widespread.

Pakistani law mandates that any \"blasphemies\" of the Quran are to be met with punishment. On July 28, 1994, [[Amnesty International]] urged Pakistan's Prime Minister, [[Benazir Bhutto]] to change the law because it was being used to terrorize religious minorities. She tried, but was unsuccessful. However, she modified the laws to make them more moderate. Her changes were reversed by the [[Nawaz Sharif]] administration which was backed by religious political parties.\n\nHere is a list of some notable incidents involving blasphemy accusations:\n* Ayub Masih, a Christian, was convicted of blasphemy and sentenced to death in 1998.

Journalists also have been victims of violence and intimidation by various groups and individuals. In spite of these difficulties, the press publishes freely on other matters, although journalists often exercise self-restraint in their writing to avoid inuring the wrath of the government or military.\n\nIn 2001, citizens participated in [[2002 Pakistani general elections|general elections]], but those elections were criticized as deeply flawed by domestic and international observers. Societal actors also are responsible for human rights abuses. Violence by drug lords and sectarian militias claims numerous innocent lives, [[discrimination]] and violence against women are widespread, [[human trafficking]] is problematic, and debt slavery and bonded labor persist.\n\nThe government often ignores abuses against children and religious minorities, and some government institutions and [[Muslim]] groups have persecuted non-Muslims and used some laws as the legal basis for doing so. The Blasphemy law, for example, allows life imprisonment or the [[death penalty]] for contravening Islamic principles, but legislation was passed in October 2004 to attempt to counter misuse of the law.\n\nFurthermore, the social acceptance of many these problems hinders their eradication. One prominent example is [[honor killing]]s (\u201c[[karo kari]]\u201d), which are believed to have accounted for more than 4,000 deaths from 1998 to 2003.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.asianews.it/index.php?l=en&art=1187 |title = Honour killing and}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rightsofhuman.com/political-abuse-of-human-rights-in-pakistan/|title=Political abuse of Human rights in Pakistan|last=Human Right in Pakistan|date=2019|website=Rights of Human|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=26 December 2019}}</ref> Many view this practice as indicative of a feudal mentality and falsely anathema to [[Islam]], but others defend the practice as a means of punishing violators of cultural norms and view attempts to stop it to as an assault on cultural heritage.\n\nPakistan was recommended by the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) in May to be designated as a \u201cCountry of Particular Concern\u201d (CPC) by the Department of State because of its government's engagement or toleration of systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/article/20060822/23922.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 2, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20060901130228/http://www.christianpost.com/article/20060822/23922.htm |archivedate=September 1, 2006 }}</ref>\n\n== Humanitarian response to conflict ==\nViolence in Pakistan and the Taliban conflict with the government have heightened humanitarian problems in Pakistan.<ref name=ODI>Sara Pantuliano (2009) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=3765&title=conflict-humanitarian-pakistan-stability-taliban Uncharted Territory: Land, Conflict and Humanitarian Action] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307103940/http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=3765&title=conflict-humanitarian-pakistan-stability-taliban |date=March 7, 2012 }} [[Overseas Development Institute]]</ref> Political and military interests have been prioritized over humanitarian considerations in the offensives against the Taliban, and issues are likely to get worse as people are encouraged back home prematurely and often face once again being victims of the Taliban terrorists.<ref name=ODI/> Displacement is a key problem and humanitarian organizations are failing to address the basic needs of people outside displacement camps, nor are they able to address issues such as the conduct of hostilities and the politicization of the emergency response.<ref name=ODI/> Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] argue that aid agencies face dilemmas with engaging with the government, as this does not always produce the desired results and can conflict with their aim of promoting stability and maintaining a principled approach.<ref name=ODI/> A principled approach limits their ability to operate when the government emphasizes political and security considerations.<ref name=ODI/>\n\n=== Internally displaced people ===\nThere were over 500,000 people displaced in 2008 mainly from the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) on the border with Afghanistan, and a further 1.4 million from Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa in May 2009.<ref name=ODI/> By mid-July 2009, Pakistan's National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) put the total of [[Internally Displaced People]] (IDPs) at just over 2m, while unofficial figures are as high as 3.5m.<ref name=ODI/> Most of those displaced (up to 80%) were taken in by relatives, friends and even strangers \u2013 Pashtun communities in particular have displayed great efforts in assisting the displaced despite their own high levels of poverty.<ref name=ODI/> Still others use schools, but only a small minority live in approximately 30 official camps, mainly in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan.<ref name=ODI/>\n\nThere is little support for those living outside of camps, official support consists only of some food and non-food items and government cash grants.<ref name=ODI/> Many of those who have been taken in are looked after by political and religious groups providing assistance in return for membership or support.<ref name=ODI/> The government has been struggling to provide support to an area traditionally marginalized and remote and is also keen to downplay the scale of the crisis.<ref name=ODI/> Before military operations are undertaken, little preparation is made for the predictable increase in displaced peoples in order to avoid attracting the attention of opposing forces.<ref name=ODI/> There are also suggestions that help given to IDPs is informed by cultural and political expediency, as in the case of a $300 family cash grant.<ref name=ODI/>\n\nThe [[international community]]'s assistance is marginal in comparison to local efforts due to the rate and scale of displacement; the scattering of displaced populations among host families and in spontaneous settlements; access difficulties due to insecurity and the role of the military in the relief effort.<ref name=ODI/> International [[humanitarian organization]]s have focused on camp-based populations and this limited interaction has hampered their attempts to analyze the full complexity of the situation, the context, its different actors and their interests \u2013 all of which are key to ensuring that the humanitarian imperative is achieved in this complex operating environment.<ref name=ODI/>\n\nThe cluster method often used for the coordination and funding of humanitarian responses to IDPs have been criticized many agencies have bypassed the UN cluster, such as [[OFDA]] and [[DfID]].<ref name=ODI/> However, operational agencies also indicated that donors have also been slow to challenge government policy due to their overall support to the Pakistani counter-insurgency effort, as well as lack of influence.<ref name=ODI/>\n\nThe government has come under criticism also for downplaying the crisis, but also for weakening the position of the UN though the \u2018One UN Approach\u2019 in Pakistan, leaving a UN unable to function properly.<ref name=ODI/> Furthermore, in an effort to force refugees back to the areas they have fled (in order to create a sense of normalcy), the government has cut off power and water supply to the IDP camps.<ref name=ODI/>\n\n=== \"Friends of Pakistan\" ===\nMany donors see the conflict as an opportunity for more comprehensive engagement in an effort to promote stability in the region, to promote a legitimate government and curtail transnational threats.<ref name=ODI/> The \u2018[[Friends of Pakistan]]\u2019 group, which includes the US, the UK and the UN, is key in the international community's drive to promote stability. The US has adopted a joint \u2018[[Af-Pak]]\u2019 (Afghanistan and Pakistan) strategy in order to suppress the insurgency and defend its national security interests.<ref name=ODI/> This strategy seeks engagement with the government and the military intelligence communities, develop civilian and democratic governance, for instance through the provision of services and support in \u2018cleared areas\u2019 in FATA and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, and increasing assistance including direct budget support, development aid and support with counter-insurgency work.<ref name=ODI/> The UK equally sees an opportunity to counter instability and militancy through a combined military and [[Winning hearts and minds|'hearts and minds']] approach, through judicial, governance and security sector reform. The [[UNDP]]/[[WFP]] takes a similar line.<ref name=ODI/>\n\nYet the success of this approach is by no means clear, as both the government and society at large are not welcoming of foreign interference.<ref name=ODI/> [[USAID]] takes into account political as well as humanitarian dimensions in its decision making process.<ref name=ODI/> Many civilians see little distinction between aid agencies, the military operations and \"western interests\"; \u2018you bomb our villages and then build hospitals\u2019.<ref name=ODI/> Many [[humanitarian organisation]]s thus avoid being too visible and do not mark their aid with their logos.<ref name=ODI/>\n\n==Discrimination against ethnic and religious minorities{{anchor|Discrimination_against_religious_minorities}}==\n{{see also|Religious discrimination in Pakistan|Sectarian violence in Pakistan}}\nPakistan is known for widespread discrimination against religious minorities, with attacks against [[Christians]], [[Hindus]], [[Ahmadiyya]], [[Shia]], [[Sufism|Sufi]] and [[Sikh]] communities being widespread.
