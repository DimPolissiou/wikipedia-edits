It also has an underground station (named '''Altona''') which is served by the rapid transit trains of the [[Hamburg S-Bahn]].<ref name=\"HVV plan\">{{Citation |author=Staff |publisher=[[Hamburger Verkehrsverbund]] |url=http://www.hvv.de/pdf/fahrplaene/usar/hvv_usar_regio.pdf |title=Rapid Transit/Regional Rail (Network plan, pdf) |accessdate=2009-01-24 |date=2008-12-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117074514/http://www.hvv.de/pdf/fahrplaene/usar/hvv_usar_regio.pdf |archivedate=2009-01-17 }}</ref> The station is managed by [[DB Station&Service]].<ref name =categories/>\n\n== History ==\nThe original Altona station was built by the [[Altona-Kiel Railway Company]] at the end of the [[Hamburg-Altona\u2013Kiel railway|line from Kiel]], some 300 metres south of the current station. It opened in 1844, at which time Altona was an independent city within the [[Duchy of Holstein]] (the old station is currently used as the present-day Altona borough's [[town hall]]).\n\nIn 1866 the [[Hamburg-Altona link line|link line]] was opened, allowing trains to run through to Klosterthor station (near the main train station) and on to [[Berlin]] or [[Hanover]]. In 1867 the [[Altona-Blankenese railway]] was opened to the towns on the right bank of the river [[Elbe]] (this line is today used by S-Bahn lines S1 and S11).\n\nIn 1898 ''Altona Hauptbahnhof'' (Altona main station) was opened at the current location. It was badly damaged during [[World War II]] but subsequently rebuilt. The building was finally demolished in the late 1970s during the construction of the [[City-S-Bahn]] despite protests; it was feared that the tunnelling would cause the structure to collapse. It was replaced by the current two-storey, low-rise precast concrete structure upon its opening in 1979.\n\n==Future==\nIn September 2009 the ''[[Hamburger Morgenpost]]'' and ''[[Die Welt]]'' revealed that [[Deutsche Bahn|Deutsche Bahn AG]] plans to close the long distance train station at Altona and to build a new station in the area of [[Diebsteich station]]. According to ''Die Welt'', the [[Government of Hamburg|city government]] had preliminary studies for the area to build flats and a park. Initially it was expected that the new station would open in 2016.<ref name=\"mopo2009\">{{cite news |url=http://archiv.mopo.de/archiv/2009/20090903/hamburg/politik/wohnungsbau_statt_sackbahnhof.html |title=Wohnungsbau statt Sackbahnhof |trans-title=Flats building instead of terminal |publisher=[[Hamburger Morgenpost]] |language=German |author=Thomas Hirschbiegel, Jessica Kr\u00f6ll |date=2009-09-03 |accessdate=2009-10-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910182429/http://archiv.mopo.de/archiv/2009/20090903/hamburg/politik/wohnungsbau_statt_sackbahnhof.html |archivedate=2009-09-10 }}</ref><ref name=\"welt2009\">{{cite news |url=https://www.welt.de/die-welt/vermischtes/hamburg/article4630907/Die-Bahn-legt-sich-fest-Fernbahnhof-Altona-wird-bis-2016-verlegt.html |title=Deutsche Bahn legt sich fest: Fernbahnhof Altona wird bis 2016 verlegt |trans-title=German Rail predefined: Long distance station Altona transferred until 2016 |language=German |newspaper=[[Die Welt]] |date=2009-09-26 |accessdate=2009-10-09 |author=Olaf Dittmann}}</ref>\n\n== Station layout ==\nRegional and long-distance trains start and terminate at the street-level bay platforms within the terminal.

It also has an underground station (named '''Altona''') which is served by the rapid transit trains of the [[Hamburg S-Bahn]].<ref name=\"HVV plan\">{{Citation |author=Staff |publisher=[[Hamburger Verkehrsverbund]] |url=http://www.hvv.de/pdf/fahrplaene/usar/hvv_usar_regio.pdf |title=Rapid Transit/Regional Rail (Network plan, pdf) |accessdate=2009-01-24 |date=2008-12-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117074514/http://www.hvv.de/pdf/fahrplaene/usar/hvv_usar_regio.pdf |archivedate=2009-01-17 }}</ref> The station is managed by [[DB Station&Service]].<ref name =categories/>\n\n== History ==\nThe original Altona station was built by the [[Altona-Kiel Railway Company]] at the end of the [[Hamburg-Altona\u2013Kiel railway|line from Kiel]], some 300 metres south of the current station. It opened in 1844, at which time Altona was an independent city within the [[Duchy of Holstein]] (the old station is currently used as the present-day Altona borough's [[town hall]]).\n\nIn 1866 the [[Hamburg-Altona link line|link line]] was opened, allowing trains to run through to Klosterthor station (near the main train station) and on to [[Berlin]] or [[Hanover]]. In 1867 the [[Altona-Blankenese railway]] was opened to the towns on the right bank of the river [[Elbe]] (this line is today used by S-Bahn lines S1 and S11).\n\nIn 1898 ''Altona Hauptbahnhof'' (Altona main station) was opened at the current location. It was badly damaged during [[World War II]] but subsequently rebuilt. The building was finally demolished in the late 1970s during the construction of the [[City-S-Bahn]] despite protests; it was feared that the tunnelling would cause the structure to collapse. It was replaced by the current two-storey, low-rise precast concrete structure upon its opening in 1979.\n\n==Future==\nIn September 2009 the ''[[Hamburger Morgenpost]]'' and ''[[Die Welt]]'' revealed that [[Deutsche Bahn|Deutsche Bahn AG]] plans to close the long distance train station at Altona and to build a new station in the area of [[Diebsteich station]]. According to ''Die Welt'', the [[Government of Hamburg|city government]] had preliminary studies for the area to build flats and a park. Initially it was expected that the new station would open in 2016.<ref name=\"mopo2009\">{{cite news |url=http://archiv.mopo.de/archiv/2009/20090903/hamburg/politik/wohnungsbau_statt_sackbahnhof.html |title=Wohnungsbau statt Sackbahnhof |trans-title=Flats building instead of terminal |publisher=[[Hamburger Morgenpost]] |language=German |author=Thomas Hirschbiegel, Jessica Kr\u00f6ll |date=2009-09-03 |accessdate=2009-10-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910182429/http://archiv.mopo.de/archiv/2009/20090903/hamburg/politik/wohnungsbau_statt_sackbahnhof.html |archivedate=2009-09-10 }}</ref><ref name=\"welt2009\">{{cite news |url=https://www.welt.de/die-welt/vermischtes/hamburg/article4630907/Die-Bahn-legt-sich-fest-Fernbahnhof-Altona-wird-bis-2016-verlegt.html |title=Deutsche Bahn legt sich fest: Fernbahnhof Altona wird bis 2016 verlegt |trans-title=German Rail predefined: Long distance station Altona transferred until 2016 |language=German |newspaper=[[Die Welt]] |date=2009-09-26 |accessdate=2009-10-09 |author=Olaf Dittmann}}</ref>\n\n== Station layout ==\nRegional and long-distance trains start and terminate at the street-level bay platforms within the terminal.

He hadn't attended the elite quarterback camps and wasn't a widely known prospect. His high school team didn't participate in many 7-on-7 camps because Josh and many of his teammates were busy playing baseball and other sports.

[[San Diego State Aztecs football|San Diego State]] made him an offer to [[Walk-on (sports)|walk on]], but Allen turned it down because Aztecs coach [[Rocky Long]] couldn't guarantee any playing time. In a 2017 story on Allen, [[ESPN]] journalist [[Mark Schlabach]] speculated on why Allen got so little interest out of high school:<ref name=\"Schlabach\" />\n<blockquote>At the time, Josh was about 6-foot-3 and 180 pounds. He hadn't attended the elite quarterback camps and wasn't a widely known prospect. His high school team didn't participate in many 7-on-7 camps because Josh and many of his teammates were busy playing baseball and other sports. He was the leading scorer on his basketball team and also pitched on the baseball team, reaching 90 mph with his fastball.</blockquote> [[Yahoo Sports]] writer Jeff Eisenberg added in another 2017 story,<ref name=\"Eisenberg\" /><blockquote>At a time when many scholarship-hungry families encourage their kids to specialize in one sport or to transfer to the school that will provide the most exposure, the Allens resisted both trends. They spurned overtures from more prominent [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] programs after Allen\u2019s breakout junior season and kept him at Firebaugh, living by the family mantra that \"you bloom where you\u2019re planted.\"</blockquote> Not only was Allen involved in multiple sports while in high school, he also regularly worked on the family farm and at the restaurant his mother operated in Firebaugh.<ref name=\"Eisenberg\" />\n\nAllen was a member of the [[National FFA Organization]] through his local chapter at Firebaugh High School.

I didn\u2019t understand it. I couldn\u2019t believe that nobody wanted him.\"<ref name=\"Eisenberg\" /> Allen did not play in the team's first three games in 2014, but in the next game he ran for four touchdowns after coming off the bench, and soon became the team's starter,<ref name=\"Schlabach\" /> throwing for 25 touchdowns with only 4 interceptions for the rest of the season.<ref name=\"Eisenberg\" /> By then, he had grown to 6'5\" and 210 pounds (1.96 m, 95&nbsp;kg), and his coaches at Reedley thought that he would soon receive many FBS scholarship offers.
