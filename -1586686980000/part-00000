The field of players is smaller than those of the other major championships because it is an invitational event, held by the Augusta National Golf Club.\n\nThe tournament has a number of traditions. Since [[1949 Masters Tournament|1949]], a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, although it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless he needs to be re-fitted with a new jacket).<ref>{{cite web |first=Brent |last=Kelley |title=Do Masters Champions Get to Keep the Green Jacket? |url=http://golf.about.com/od/majorchampionships/f/keep_jacket.htm |publisher=About.com}}</ref> The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by [[Ben Hogan]] in [[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in [[1963 Masters Tournament|1963]], legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot on the morning of the first round to commence play. These have included [[Fred McLeod]], [[Jock Hutchinson]], [[Gene Sarazen]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Byron Nelson]], [[Arnold Palmer]], [[Jack Nicklaus]], and [[Gary Player]]. Since [[1960 Masters Tournament|1960]], a [[Masters Tournament Par-3 contest|semi-social contest]] at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.\n\nNicklaus has the most Masters wins, with six between 1963 and 1986. [[Tiger Woods]] has won five. Palmer has won four. Five have won three titles at Augusta: [[Jimmy Demaret]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Gary Player]], [[Nick Faldo]], and [[Phil Mickelson]]. Player, from [[South Africa]], was the first non-American player to win the tournament, in [[1961 Masters Tournament|1961]]; the second was [[Seve Ballesteros]] of [[Spain]], the champion in [[1980 Masters Tournament|1980]] and [[1983 Masters Tournament|1983]].\n\nThe Augusta National course first opened {{Years or months ago|1933}} in 1933 and has been modified many times by different architects. Among the changes: greens have been reshaped and, on occasion, entirely re-designed, bunkers have been added, water hazards have been extended, new tee boxes have been built, hundreds of trees have been planted, and several mounds have been installed.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\">{{cite book |title=The Making of the Masters: Clifford Roberts, Augusta National, and Golf's Most Prestigious Tournament |first=David |last=Owen |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-684-85729-9}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:AugustaNationalMastersLogoFlowers.jpg|thumb|<center>Masters logo<br>at the club entrance</center>]]\n\n===Augusta National Golf Club===\n{{main|Augusta National Golf Club}}\nThe idea for Augusta National originated with [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]], who wanted to build a golf course after his retirement from the game.

In his first appearance at Augusta in 1981, he led during the second nine but ended up finishing fourth. In 1986, after birdieing holes 14 through 17 to tie Nicklaus for the lead, he badly pushed his 4-iron approach on 18 into the patrons surrounding the green and missed his par putt for a closing bogey.  In 1987, Norman lost a sudden-death playoff when [[Larry Mize]] holed out a remarkable 45-yard pitch shot to birdie the second playoff hole.

After making his final putt to win, he broke down sobbing at the hole and was consoled and embraced by his caddie.  In the post-tournament interview, Crenshaw said: \"I had a 15th club in my bag,\" a reference to Penick. (The \"15th club\" reference is based on the golf rule that limits a player to carrying 14 clubs during a round.)  Crenshaw first won at Augusta in 1984.\n\nIn 1997, 21 year-old [[Tiger Woods]] became the youngest champion in Masters history, winning by 12 shots with an 18-under par 270 which broke the 72-hole record that had stood for 32 years.<ref name=\"Hist\"/> In 2001 Woods completed his \"Tiger Slam\" by winning his fourth straight major championship at the Masters by two shots over [[David Duval]]. <ref name=past-results/> He won again the following year, making him only the third player in history (after Nicklaus and Faldo) to win the tournament in consecutive years,<ref name=past-results/> as well as in 2005 when he defeated [[Chris DiMarco]] in a playoff for his first major championship win in almost three years.<ref name=past-results/>\n\nIn 2003 the Augusta National Golf Club was targeted by [[Martha Burk]], who organized a failed protest at that year's Masters to pressure the club into accepting female members.

The green sport coat is the official attire worn by members of Augusta National while on the club grounds; each Masters winner becomes an honorary member of the club. The recipient of the green jacket has it presented to him inside the Butler Cabin soon after the end of the tournament in a televised ceremony, and the presentation is then repeated outside near the 18th green in front of the patrons. Winners keep their jacket for the year after their victory, then return it to the club to wear whenever they are present on the club grounds. [[Sam Snead]] was the first Masters champion to be awarded the green jacket after he took his first Masters title in 1949.\n\nThe green jacket is only allowed to be removed from the Augusta National grounds by the reigning champion, after which it must remain at the club. Exceptions to this rule include Gary Player, who in his joy of winning mistakenly took his jacket home to South Africa after his 1961 victory (although he has always followed the spirit of the rule and has never worn the jacket);<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=lukas/070405 |title=The real story behind the green jacket |last=Lukas |first=Paul |work=ESPN |accessdate=November 18, 2008}}</ref> [[Seve Ballesteros]] who, in an interview with [[Peter Alliss]] from his home in Pedre\u00f1a, showed one of his two green jackets in his trophy room; and [[Henry Picard]], whose jacket was removed from the club before the tradition was well established, remained in his closet for a number of years, and is now on display at Canterbury Golf Club in [[Beachwood, Ohio]], where he was the club professional for many years.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1995/04/10/8093250/master-teacher-nearly-forgotten-now-teaching-pro-henry-picard-was-a-big-star-when-he-won-the-1938-masters |title=Master Teacher: Nearly forgotten now, teaching pro Henry Picard was a big star when he won the 1938 Masters |first=Rick |last=Lispey |magazine=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=February 9, 2016 |date=April 10, 1995}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiogolfandtravelguide.com/ohio/golf-news/michael-kernicki-hosts-major-championship-at-canterbury-golf-club.html |title=Michael Kernicki hosts Major Championship at Canterbury Golf Club |publisher=GolfGuide.com |accessdate=April 10, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111083303/http://www.ohiogolfandtravelguide.com/ohio/golf-news/michael-kernicki-hosts-major-championship-at-canterbury-golf-club.html |archivedate=November 11, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nBy tradition, the winner of the previous year's Masters Tournament puts the jacket on the current winner at the end of the tournament.

For each [[Eagle (golf)|eagle]] a player makes he receives a pair of crystal goblets.\n\nIn addition to the green jacket, winners of the tournament receive a gold medal. In 2017, a green jacket that was found at a thrift store in 1994 was sold at auction for $139,000.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/golf/2017/04/10/masters-style-green-jacket-bought-for-5-at-toronto-thrift-store-sells-for-139k.html |title=Masters-style green jacket bought for $5 at Toronto thrift store sells for $139K |newspaper=Toronto Star |agency=Associated Press |date=April 10, 2017 |access-date=April 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Trophies====\nWinners also have their names engraved on the actual silver Masters trophy.

The first two rounds will be held at the Champion's Retreat club in [[Evans, Georgia]], with the final two rounds hosted by Augusta National (the final round will take place on the Saturday directly preceding the tournament). Ridley stated that holding such an event at Augusta National would have the \"greatest impact\" on women's golf. Although concerns were raised that the event would conflict with the [[LPGA Tour]]'s [[ANA Inspiration]] (which has invited top amateur players to compete), Ridley stated that he had discussed the event with commissioner [[Mike Whan]], and stated that he agreed on the notion that any move to bolster the prominence of women's golf would be a \"win\" for the LPGA over time.

Also, the current [[U.S. Amateur]] champion always plays in the same group as the defending Masters champion for the first two days of the tournament.\n\nAmateurs in the field are welcome to stay in the \"Crow's Nest\" atop the Augusta National clubhouse during the tournament. The Crow's Nest is {{convert|1200|sqft|-1}} with lodging space for five during the competition.\n\n===Opening tee shot===\nSince 1963, the custom in most years has been to start the tournament with an honorary opening tee shot at the first hole, typically by one or more legendary players. The original honorary starters were [[Jock Hutchison]] and [[Fred McLeod]]; this twosome led off every tournament from 1963 until 1973, when poor health prevented Hutchison from swinging a club. McLeod continued on until his death in 1976. Byron Nelson and Gene Sarazen started in 1981, and were then joined by Sam Snead in 1984. This trio continued until 1999 when Sarazen died, while Nelson stopped in 2001.

Since [[1948 Masters Tournament|1948]], its final round has been scheduled for the second Sunday of April, with several exceptions. It ended on the first Sunday four times ([[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], [[1958 Masters Tournament|1958]], [[1959 Masters Tournament|1959]]) and the [[1979 Masters Tournament|1979]] and [[1984 Masters Tournament|1984]] tournaments ended on April 15, the month's third Sunday.<ref name=\"Hist\"/> The first edition in [[1934 Masters Tournament|1934]] was held in late March and the next ten were in early April, with only the [[1942 Masters Tournament|1942]] event scheduled to end on the second Sunday.  The [[2020 Masters Tournament|2020]] event, postponed by the [[COVID-19]] pandemic, is slated to be held in the autumn, with it being the last major of the year.\n\nSimilar to the other majors, the tournament consists of four rounds at 18 holes each, Thursday through Sunday (when there are no delays). The Masters has a relatively small field of contenders, when compared with other golf tournaments, so the competitors play in groups of three for the first two rounds (36 holes) and the field is not split to start on the 1st and 10th tees, unless weather shortens the available playing time, such as the second round in 1983, fourth round in 2019, and is expected for all four rounds in 2020. The tournament is unique in that it is the only major tournament conducted by a private club rather than a national golf organization like the PGA.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\" />\n\nOriginally, the Masters was the only tournament to use two-man pairings during the first two rounds. It was also the only event to re-pair based on the leaderboard before Friday's round, as most tournaments only do this on the weekend. This practice ended in the early 2000s, when the Masters switched to the more standard three-man groups and the groups are now kept intact on Friday, with players sharing the same playing partners in both of the first two rounds.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAfter 36 holes of play, a cut-off score is calculated to reduce the size of the field for the weekend rounds. To \"make the cut\", players must be either in the top 50 places (ties counting), or within 10 strokes of the leader's score. These criteria have applied since [[2013 Masters Tournament|2013]].<ref name=cut>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/masters13/story/_/id/9156060/fall-tour-event-winners-get-masters-spot |title=Masters tweaks qualifications |first=Bob |last=Harig |work=ESPN |date=April 10, 2013 |access-date=April 16, 2013}}</ref> From 1957 to 1960, the top 40 scores (including ties) and those within 10 strokes of the leader made the cut. From 1961 to 2012, it was the top 44 (and ties) or within 10 strokes of the lead.<ref name=cut/> Before [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], there was no 36-hole cut and all of the invitees played four rounds, if desired.<ref name=\"Cut\">{{cite web |url=http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |title=Cut Information |publisher=www.masters.org |access-date=January 21, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119025225/http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |archivedate=January 19, 2008}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the cut, an additional 36 holes are played over the final two days. Should the fourth round fail to produce a winner, all players tied for the lead enter a [[Sudden death (sport)#Golf|sudden-death]] playoff. Play begins on the 18th hole, followed by the adjacent 10th, repeating until one player remains.

After the arrangement continued into 2004, the tournament reinstated sponsorships for 2005, with the new partners of ExxonMobil, IBM, and SBC.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/aug/28/sports/sp-masters28 |title=Masters Is Back to Commercials |last=Stewart |first=Larry |date=2004-08-28 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |access-date=2018-04-08 |issn=0458-3035 |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine |url=https://www.si.com/vault/2003/04/08/8104128/the-battle-of-augusta-hootie-vs-martha-a-chronology-of-developments-in-golfs-most-famous-feud-between-martha-burk-the-chairwoman-of-the-national-council-of-womens-organizations-ncwo-and-hootie-johnson-the-chairman-of-augusta-na |title=The Battle of Augusta Hootie vs. Martha: A Chronology of Developments in Golf's Most Famous Feud, Between Martha Burk, the Chairwoman of the National Council Of Women's Organizations (NCWO), and Hootie Johnson, the Chairman of Augusta National Golf Club  |last=Yen |first=Yi-Wyn |magazine=Sports Illustrated |date=April 8, 2003 |access-date=2018-04-08 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe club also sells separate sponsorship packages, which do not provide rights to air commercials on the U.S. telecasts, to two \"international partners\"; in 2014, those companies were [[Rolex]] and [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] (the latter of which replaced Mercedes-Benz upon that company's elevation to \"global sponsor\" status).<ref name=\"2014 sponsors\"/>\n\n===Radio coverage===\nWestwoodOne (previously [[Dial Global]] and [[CBS Radio Network|CBS Radio]]) has provided live radio play-by-play coverage in the United States since 1956.

After making his final putt to win, he broke down sobbing at the hole and was consoled and embraced by his caddie.  In the post-tournament interview, Crenshaw said: \"I had a 15th club in my bag,\" a reference to Penick.

Masters champions are automatically invited to play in the other three majors (the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], [[The Open Championship]], and the [[PGA Championship]]) for the next five years (except for amateur winners, unless they turn pro within the five-year period), and earn a lifetime invitation to the Masters.

It invites winners of the most prestigious amateur tournaments in the world. Also, the current [[U.S. Amateur]] champion always plays in the same group as the defending Masters champion for the first two days of the tournament.\n\nAmateurs in the field are welcome to stay in the \"Crow's Nest\" atop the Augusta National clubhouse during the tournament. The Crow's Nest is {{convert|1200|sqft|-1}} with lodging space for five during the competition.\n\n===Opening tee shot===\nSince 1963, the custom in most years has been to start the tournament with an honorary opening tee shot at the first hole, typically by one or more legendary players. The original honorary starters were [[Jock Hutchison]] and [[Fred McLeod]]; this twosome led off every tournament from 1963 until 1973, when poor health prevented Hutchison from swinging a club. McLeod continued on until his death in 1976. Byron Nelson and Gene Sarazen started in 1981, and were then joined by Sam Snead in 1984. This trio continued until 1999 when Sarazen died, while Nelson stopped in 2001. Snead hit his final opening tee shot in 2002, a little over a month before he died.\n\nIn 2007, Arnold Palmer took over as the honorary starter.

Officially known as the \"Masters Club\", it includes only past winners of the Masters, although selected members of the Augusta National Golf Club have been included as honorary members, usually the chairman.\n\nThe defending champion, as host, selects the menu for the dinner. Frequently, Masters champions have served cuisine from their home regions prepared by the Masters chef. Notable examples have included [[haggis]], served by [[Scotland|Scotsman]] [[Sandy Lyle]] in 1989,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.masters.org/en_US/course/landmarks.html#dinner |title=Masters Club |publisher=www.masters.org |accessdate=January 25, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109192302/http://www.masters.org/en_US/course/landmarks.html |archivedate=January 9, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and [[bobotie]], a South African dish, served at the behest of 2008 champion [[Trevor Immelman]]. Other examples include German Bernhard Langer's 1986 Wiener schnitzel, Britain's Nick Faldo's fish and chips, Canadian Mike Weir's elk and wild boar, and Vijay Singh's seafood tom kah and chicken panang curry. In 1997, 1979 champion [[Fuzzy Zoeller]] created a media storm when he suggested that Tiger Woods refrain from serving collard greens and fried chicken, dishes commonly associated with Afro-American culture, at the dinner. The 2011 dinner of [[Phil Mickelson]] was a Spanish-themed menu in hopes that [[Seve Ballesteros]] would attend, but he was too sick to attend and died  weeks later.<ref>[http://www.golf.com/tour-news/2017/03/15/masters-champions-dinner-everything-you-need-know Masters Champions Dinner: Everything you need to know]</ref>\n\n===Caddies===\nUntil [[1983 Masters Tournament|1983]], all players in the Masters were required to use the services of an Augusta National Club [[caddie]],<ref name=trcdatag>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WFcaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yiQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6177%2C1789683 |newspaper=Times-News |location=Hendersonville, North Carolina |title=Tour caddies at Augusta? |date=November 12, 1982 |page=14}}</ref><ref name=alctrbgd>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3LUSAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mvkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6774%2C1068214 |newspaper=Spokane Chronicle |location=Washington |last=Wade |first=Harless |title=Tradition bagged at Masters |date=April 6, 1983 |page=C1}}</ref><ref name=mcadcol>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xMksAAAAIBAJ&sjid=chMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6823%2C3348928 |newspaper=Sunday Star-News |location=Wilmington, North Carolina |last=Anderson |first=Dave |authorlink=Dave Anderson (sportswriter) |title=New Masters caddies collide |date=April 10, 1983 |page=6D}}</ref> who by club tradition was always an African American man.<ref name=\"nyt1990\"/> Indeed, club co-founder [[Clifford Roberts]] is reputed to have said, \"As long as I'm alive, golfers will be white, and caddies will be black.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Rick |last=Reilly |authorlink=Rick Reilly |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1997/04/21/225867/strokes-of-genius-overpowering-a-storied-course-and-a-stellar-field-tiger-woods-heralded-a-new-era-in-golf-with-an-awesome-12-shot-victory-in-the-masters |title=Strokes of Genius |date=April 21, 1997 |accessdate=February 9, 2016 |magazine=Sports Illustrated}}</ref> Since 1983\u2014six years after Roberts's death in 1977\u2014players have been allowed the option of bringing their own caddie to the tournament.\n\nThe Masters requires caddies to wear a uniform consisting of a white jumpsuit, a green Masters cap, and white tennis shoes.

Since [[1948 Masters Tournament|1948]], its final round has been scheduled for the second Sunday of April, with several exceptions. It ended on the first Sunday four times ([[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], [[1958 Masters Tournament|1958]], [[1959 Masters Tournament|1959]]) and the [[1979 Masters Tournament|1979]] and [[1984 Masters Tournament|1984]] tournaments ended on April 15, the month's third Sunday.<ref name=\"Hist\"/> The first edition in [[1934 Masters Tournament|1934]] was held in late March and the next ten were in early April, with only the [[1942 Masters Tournament|1942]] event scheduled to end on the second Sunday.  The [[2020 Masters Tournament|2020]] event, postponed by the [[COVID-19]] pandemic, is slated to be held in the autumn, with it being the last major of the year.\n\nSimilar to the other majors, the tournament consists of four rounds at 18 holes each, Thursday through Sunday (when there are no delays). The Masters has a relatively small field of contenders, when compared with other golf tournaments, so the competitors play in groups of three for the first two rounds (36 holes) and the field is not split to start on the 1st and 10th tees, unless weather shortens the available playing time, such as the second round in 1983, fourth round in 2019, and is expected for all four rounds in 2020. The tournament is unique in that it is the only major tournament conducted by a private club rather than a national golf organization like the PGA.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\" />\n\nOriginally, the Masters was the only tournament to use two-man pairings during the first two rounds. It was also the only event to re-pair based on the leaderboard before Friday's round, as most tournaments only do this on the weekend. This practice ended in the early 2000s, when the Masters switched to the more standard three-man groups and the groups are now kept intact on Friday, with players sharing the same playing partners in both of the first two rounds.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAfter 36 holes of play, a cut-off score is calculated to reduce the size of the field for the weekend rounds. To \"make the cut\", players must be either in the top 50 places (ties counting), or within 10 strokes of the leader's score. These criteria have applied since [[2013 Masters Tournament|2013]].<ref name=cut>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/masters13/story/_/id/9156060/fall-tour-event-winners-get-masters-spot |title=Masters tweaks qualifications |first=Bob |last=Harig |work=ESPN |date=April 10, 2013 |access-date=April 16, 2013}}</ref> From 1957 to 1960, the top 40 scores (including ties) and those within 10 strokes of the leader made the cut. From 1961 to 2012, it was the top 44 (and ties) or within 10 strokes of the lead.<ref name=cut/> Before [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], there was no 36-hole cut and all of the invitees played four rounds, if desired.<ref name=\"Cut\">{{cite web |url=http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |title=Cut Information |publisher=www.masters.org |access-date=January 21, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119025225/http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |archivedate=January 19, 2008}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the cut, an additional 36 holes are played over the final two days. Should the fourth round fail to produce a winner, all players tied for the lead enter a [[Sudden death (sport)#Golf|sudden-death]] playoff.

Her interactions in this program strengthened her motivation to find new vaccines and treatments. She studied the pathogenesis of [[HIV-1]] throughout her medical career. Her early research considered where [[HIV]] could infect other cells in the body than just blood, including the brain and lungs.<ref name=\":0\" /> She started working at Sanquin, a blood supply agency based in [[Amsterdam]], where she was made Clinical Immunology in 1998. In 1996, researchers at the [[Academic Medical Center]] had discovered [[Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy]] (HAART), a medical cocktail that can outsmart the evolving virus. Schuitemaker is involved with policy, and holds advisory positions on several vaccine charities. During the 2000s she held visiting positions at the [[La Jolla]] [[Scripps Research]] Institute.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecsj2017.com/profile/hanneke-schuitemaker|title=Hanneke

From 1983\u20131987 the events aired live on closed-circuit TV under the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA) banner. Beginning in 1987, the events started airing live on pay-per-view TV while still under the NWA banner. In November 1988 Jim Crockett Promotions sold its assets to [[Turner Broadcasting System]], which used them to rebrand the company as World Championship Wrestling. Beginning in 1991 and lasting until 2001, the pay-per-view events were promoted under the WCW banner. In 1998 and early 1999, PPV events were promoted using the WCW/[[New World Order (professional wrestling)|nWo]] brand.\n\nIn 2001, the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]], now known as WWE, purchased the assets of WCW, including the [[WWE Libraries|video libraries]] of all previous NWA and WCW pay-per-views, and the ownership rights of the names of these events. To date WWE has only promoted one pay-per-view event using the name of a former WCW PPV, [[The Great American Bash]], from 2004 until 2009. In 2012, it was rebooted as a live [[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]] special. In 2017, WWE revived the Starrcade name for a non-televised [[house show]].\n\nBeginning in 2014, nearly all NWA and WCW pay-per-view events were made available on the [[WWE Network]].\n\n==NWA (Jim Crockett Promotions) closed-circuit television events==\n===1983===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable succession-box\" style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n! width=8%| Date\n! width=14%| Event\n! width=14%| Venue\n! width=14%| Location\n! width=50%| Main event\n|-\n\n|November 24\n|[[Starrcade (1983)|Starrcade]]\n|[[Greensboro Coliseum]]\n|[[Greensboro, North Carolina]]\n|[[Harley Race]] vs. [[Ric Flair]]\n|}\n\n===1984===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable succession-box\" style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n! width=8%| Date\n! width=14%| Event\n! width=14%| Venue\n! width=14%| Location\n! width=50%| Main event\n|-\n\n|November 22\n|[[Starrcade (1984)|Starrcade]]\n|[[Greensboro Coliseum]]\n|[[Greensboro, North Carolina]]\n|[[Ric Flair]] vs. [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]]\n|}\n\n===1985===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable succession-box\" style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n! width=8%| Date\n! width=14%| Event\n! width=14%| Venue\n! width=14%| Location\n! width=50%| Main event\n|-\n\n|July 6\n|[[The Great American Bash (1985)|The Great American Bash]]\n|[[American Legion Memorial Stadium]]\n|[[Charlotte, North Carolina]]\n|[[Tully Blanchard]] vs. [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]]\n|-\n|November 28\n|[[Starrcade (1985)|Starrcade]]\n|[[Greensboro Coliseum]]<br>[[The Omni]]\n|[[Greensboro, North Carolina]]<br>[[Atlanta]]\n|[[Ric Flair]] vs. [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]]\n|}\n\n===1986===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable succession-box\" style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n! width=8%| Date\n! width=14%| Event\n! width=14%| Venue\n! width=14%| Location\n! width=50%| Main event\n|-\n|November 27\n|[[Starrcade (1986)|Starrcade]]\n|[[Greensboro Coliseum]]<br>[[The Omni]]\n|[[Greensboro, North Carolina]]<br>[[Atlanta]]\n|[[Ric Flair]] vs. [[Nikita Koloff]]\n|}\n\n==NWA (Jim Crockett Promotions) pay-per-view events==\n===1987===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable succession-box\" style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n! width=8%| Date\n! width=14%| Event\n! width=14%| Venue\n! width=14%| Location\n! width=50%| Main event\n|-\n\n|November 26\n|[[Starrcade (1987)|Starrcade]]\n|[[UIC Pavilion]]\n|[[Chicago]]\n|[[Ron Garvin]] vs. [[Ric Flair]]\n|}\n\n===1988===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable succession-box\" style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n! width=8%| Date\n! width=14%| Event\n! width=14%| Venue\n! width=14%| Location\n! width=50%| Main event\n|-\n\n|January 24\n|[[Bunkhouse Stampede (1988)|The Bunkhouse Stampede Finals]]\n|[[Nassau Coliseum]]\n|[[Uniondale, New York]]\n|[[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]] vs. [[Arn Anderson]] vs. [[The Barbarian (wrestler)|The Barbarian]] vs. [[Tully Blanchard]] vs. [[Ivan Koloff]] vs. [[Lex Luger]] vs. [[Road Warrior Animal]] vs. [[The Warlord (wrestler)|The Warlord]]\n|-\n|July 10\n|[[The Great American Bash (1988)|The Great American Bash]]\n|[[Baltimore Arena]]\n|[[Baltimore]]\n|[[Ric Flair]] vs. [[Lex Luger]]\n|}\n\n==NWA (World Championship Wrestling) pay-per-view events==\n===1988===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable succession-box\" style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n! width=8%| Date\n! width=14%| Event\n! width=14%| Venue\n! width=14%| Location\n! width=50%| Main event\n|-\n\n|December 26\n|[[Starrcade (1988)|Starrcade]]\n|[[Norfolk Scope]]\n|[[Norfolk, Virginia]]\n|[[Ric Flair]] vs. [[Lex Luger]]\n|}\n\n===1989===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable succession-box\" style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n! width=8%| Date\n! width=14%| Event\n! width=14%| Venue\n! width=14%| Location\n! width=50%| Main event\n|-\n\n|February 20\n|[[Chi-Town Rumble]]\n|[[UIC Pavilion]]\n|[[Chicago]]\n|[[Ric Flair]] vs. [[Ricky Steamboat]]\n|-\n|May 7\n|[[WrestleWar (1989)|WrestleWar]]\n|[[Nashville Municipal Auditorium]]\n|[[Nashville, Tennessee]]\n|[[Eddie Gilbert (wrestler)|Eddie Gilbert]] and [[Rick Steiner]] vs. [[Varsity Club]] ([[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]] and [[Dan Spivey]])\n|-\n|July 23\n|[[The Great American Bash (1989)|The Great American Bash]]\n|[[Baltimore Arena]]\n|[[Baltimore]]\n|[[Ric Flair]] vs. [[Terry Funk]]\n|-\n|October 28\n|[[Halloween Havoc (1989)|Halloween Havoc]]\n|[[Philadelphia Convention Hall and Civic Center|Philadelphia Civic Center]]\n|[[Philadelphia]]\n|[[Ric Flair]] and [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] vs. [[Keiji Mutoh|The Great Muta]] and [[Terry Funk]]\n|-\n|December 13\n|[[Starrcade (1989)|Starrcade]]\n|[[Omni Coliseum|The Omni]]\n|[[Atlanta]]\n|[[Ric Flair]] vs. [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]]\n|}\n\n===1990===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable succession-box\" style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n! width=8%| Date\n! width=14%| Event\n! width=14%| Venue\n! width=14%| Location\n! width=50%| Main event\n|-\n\n|February 25\n|[[WrestleWar (1990)|WrestleWar]]\n|[[Greensboro Coliseum]]\n|[[Greensboro, North Carolina]]\n|[[Ric Flair]] vs. [[Lex Luger]]\n|-\n|May 19\n|[[Capital Combat]]\n|[[D.C.

From 1983\u20131987 the events aired live on closed-circuit TV under the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA) banner. Beginning in 1987, the events started airing live on pay-per-view TV while still under the NWA banner. In November 1988 Jim Crockett Promotions sold its assets to [[Turner Broadcasting System]], which used them to rebrand the company as World Championship Wrestling. Beginning in 1991 and lasting until 2001, the pay-per-view events were promoted under the WCW banner. In 1998 and early 1999, PPV events were promoted using the WCW/[[New World Order (professional wrestling)|nWo]] brand.\n\nIn 2001, the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]], now known as WWE, purchased the assets of WCW, including the [[WWE Libraries|video libraries]] of all previous NWA and WCW pay-per-views, and the ownership rights of the names of these events. To date WWE has only promoted one pay-per-view event using the name of a former WCW PPV, [[The Great American Bash]], from 2004 until 2009. In 2012, it was rebooted as a live [[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]] special. In 2017, WWE revived the Starrcade name for a non-televised [[house show]].\n\nBeginning in 2014, nearly all NWA and WCW pay-per-view events were made available on the [[WWE Network]].\n\n==NWA (Jim Crockett Promotions) closed-circuit television events==\n===1983===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable succession-box\" style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n! width=8%| Date\n! width=14%| Event\n! width=14%| Venue\n! width=14%| Location\n! width=50%| Main event\n|-\n\n|November 24\n|[[Starrcade (1983)|Starrcade]]\n|[[Greensboro Coliseum]]\n|[[Greensboro, North Carolina]]\n|[[Harley Race]] vs. [[Ric Flair]]\n|}\n\n===1984===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable succession-box\" style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n! width=8%| Date\n! width=14%| Event\n! width=14%| Venue\n! width=14%| Location\n! width=50%| Main event\n|-\n\n|November 22\n|[[Starrcade (1984)|Starrcade]]\n|[[Greensboro Coliseum]]\n|[[Greensboro, North Carolina]]\n|[[Ric Flair]] vs. [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]]\n|}\n\n===1985===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable succession-box\" style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n! width=8%| Date\n! width=14%| Event\n! width=14%| Venue\n! width=14%| Location\n! width=50%| Main event\n|-\n\n|July 6\n|[[The Great American Bash (1985)|The Great American Bash]]\n|[[American Legion Memorial Stadium]]\n|[[Charlotte, North Carolina]]\n|[[Tully Blanchard]] vs. [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]]\n|-\n|November 28\n|[[Starrcade (1985)|Starrcade]]\n|[[Greensboro Coliseum]]<br>[[The Omni]]\n|[[Greensboro, North Carolina]]<br>[[Atlanta]]\n|[[Ric Flair]] vs. [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]]\n|}\n\n===1986===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable succession-box\" style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n! width=8%| Date\n! width=14%| Event\n! width=14%| Venue\n! width=14%| Location\n! width=50%| Main event\n|-\n|November 27\n|[[Starrcade (1986)|Starrcade]]\n|[[Greensboro Coliseum]]<br>[[The Omni]]\n|[[Greensboro, North Carolina]]<br>[[Atlanta]]\n|[[Ric Flair]] vs. [[Nikita Koloff]]\n|}\n\n==NWA (Jim Crockett Promotions) pay-per-view events==\n===1987===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable succession-box\" style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n! width=8%| Date\n! width=14%| Event\n! width=14%| Venue\n! width=14%| Location\n! width=50%| Main event\n|-\n\n|November 26\n|[[Starrcade (1987)|Starrcade]]\n|[[UIC Pavilion]]\n|[[Chicago]]\n|[[Ron Garvin]] vs. [[Ric Flair]]\n|}\n\n===1988===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable succession-box\" style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n! width=8%| Date\n! width=14%| Event\n! width=14%| Venue\n! width=14%| Location\n! width=50%| Main event\n|-\n\n|January 24\n|[[Bunkhouse Stampede (1988)|The Bunkhouse Stampede Finals]]\n|[[Nassau Coliseum]]\n|[[Uniondale, New York]]\n|[[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]] vs. [[Arn Anderson]] vs. [[The Barbarian (wrestler)|The Barbarian]] vs. [[Tully Blanchard]] vs. [[Ivan Koloff]] vs. [[Lex Luger]] vs. [[Road Warrior Animal]] vs. [[The Warlord (wrestler)|The Warlord]]\n|-\n|July 10\n|[[The Great American Bash (1988)|The Great American Bash]]\n|[[Baltimore Arena]]\n|[[Baltimore]]\n|[[Ric Flair]] vs. [[Lex Luger]]\n|}\n\n==NWA (World Championship Wrestling) pay-per-view events==\n===1988===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable succession-box\" style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n! width=8%| Date\n! width=14%| Event\n! width=14%| Venue\n! width=14%| Location\n! width=50%| Main event\n|-\n\n|December 26\n|[[Starrcade (1988)|Starrcade]]\n|[[Norfolk Scope]]\n|[[Norfolk, Virginia]]\n|[[Ric Flair]] vs. [[Lex Luger]]\n|}\n\n===1989===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable succession-box\" style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n! width=8%| Date\n! width=14%| Event\n! width=14%| Venue\n! width=14%| Location\n! width=50%| Main event\n|-\n\n|February 20\n|[[Chi-Town Rumble]]\n|[[UIC Pavilion]]\n|[[Chicago]]\n|[[Ric Flair]] vs. [[Ricky Steamboat]]\n|-\n|May 7\n|[[WrestleWar (1989)|WrestleWar]]\n|[[Nashville Municipal Auditorium]]\n|[[Nashville, Tennessee]]\n|[[Eddie Gilbert (wrestler)|Eddie Gilbert]] and [[Rick Steiner]] vs. [[Varsity Club]] ([[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]] and [[Dan Spivey]])\n|-\n|July 23\n|[[The Great American Bash (1989)|The Great American Bash]]\n|[[Baltimore Arena]]\n|[[Baltimore]]\n|[[Ric Flair]] vs. [[Terry Funk]]\n|-\n|October 28\n|[[Halloween Havoc (1989)|Halloween Havoc]]\n|[[Philadelphia Convention Hall and Civic Center|Philadelphia Civic Center]]\n|[[Philadelphia]]\n|[[Ric Flair]] and [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] vs. [[Keiji Mutoh|The Great Muta]] and [[Terry Funk]]\n|-\n|December 13\n|[[Starrcade (1989)|Starrcade]]\n|[[Omni Coliseum|The Omni]]\n|[[Atlanta]]\n|[[Ric Flair]] vs. [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]]\n|}\n\n===1990===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable succession-box\" style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n! width=8%| Date\n! width=14%| Event\n! width=14%| Venue\n! width=14%| Location\n! width=50%| Main event\n|-\n\n|February 25\n|[[WrestleWar (1990)|WrestleWar]]\n|[[Greensboro Coliseum]]\n|[[Greensboro, North Carolina]]\n|[[Ric Flair]] vs. [[Lex Luger]]\n|-\n|May 19\n|[[Capital Combat]]\n|[[D.C.

Sometimes the editing of these works without the approval of the author can lead to a court case.\n\nIt also appeals because it obviously works as a story; it has interesting characters, who say and do interesting things. This is particularly important when adapting to a dramatic work, e.g. film, stage play, teleplay, as dramatic writing is some of the most difficult. To get an original story to function well on all the necessary dimensions\u2014concept, character, story, dialogue, and action\u2014is an extremely rare event performed by a rare talent.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, especially for producers of the screen and stage, an adapted work is more bankable; it represents considerably less risk to investors, and poses the possibilities of huge financial gains. This is because:\n* It has already attracted a following.\n* It clearly works as a literary piece in appealing to a broad group of people who care.\n* Its title, author, characters, etc. may be a franchise in and of themselves already.\n\n==Film==\n{{main|Film adaptation}}\nWorks of literature have been adapted for film from the dawn of the industry.

For me she has taken on a heroic stature achieved by very few other people in history. To venture, as she did, into academia, a world almost no woman had yet explored, and to be consequently the object of curious scrutiny, while a doubting society looked on, half-expecting her to fail, took tremendous courage and determination. To achieve, as she did, at least two major results of lasting value to scholarship, is evidence of a considerable talent, developed through iron discipline.<ref name=\"rlc\">Roger L.

She herself used '''Sophie Kowalevski''' (or occasionally '''Kowalevsky''') in her academic publications.\n\n==Background and early education==\nSofya Kovalevskaya (''[[n\u00e9e]]'' Korvin-Krukovskaya) was born in Moscow, the second of three children. Her father, Lieutenant General Vasily Vasilyevich Korvin-Krukovsky, served in the [[Imperial Russian Army]] as head of the Moscow Artillery before retiring to Palibino, his family estate in [[Vitebsk Region]] in 1858, when Kovalevskaya was eight years old. He was a member of the minor nobility, of mixed (Bela)Russian\u2013Polish descent (Polish on his father's side), with possible partial ancestry from the [[Hunyadi family|royal Corvin family of Hungary]], and served as Marshall of Nobility for Vitebsk province. (There may also have been some [[Romani people|Romani]] ancestry on the father's side.<ref>{{cite web|title=Women mathematicians|author=Marie-Louise Dubreil-Jacotin|url=http://www.gap-system.org/~history/Extras/Women_mathematicians.html|publisher=JOC/EFR|accessdate=June 3, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607183749/http://www.gap-system.org/~history/Extras/Women_mathematicians.html|archivedate=June 7, 2011|author-link=Marie-Louise Dubreil-Jacotin}}</ref>)\n\nHer mother, Yelizaveta Fedorovna Shubert (Schubert), descended from a family of German immigrants to St. Petersburg who lived on Vasilievsky Island. Her maternal great grandfather was the astronomer and geographer [[Theodor von Schubert|Friedrich Theodor Schubert]] (1758\u22121825), who emigrated to Russia from Germany around 1785. He became a full member of the St. Petersburg Academy of Science and head of its astronomical observatory. His son, Kovalevskaya's maternal grandfather, was General [[Friedrich von Schubert|Theodor Friedrich von Schubert]] (1789\u22121865), who was head of the military topographic service, and an honorary member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, as well as Director of the Kunstkamera museum.\n\nKovalevskaya's parents provided her with a good early education.  At various times, her governesses were native speakers of English, French, and German. \nWhen she was 8 or 9 years old, she was intrigued by a foretaste of what she was to learn later in her lessons in calculus; the wall of her room had been papered with pages from lecture notes by [[Mikhail Ostrogradsky|Ostrogradsky]], left over from her father's student days.<ref>{{cite web|title=Best of Russia --- Famous Russians --- Scientists.|url=http://www.tristarmedia.com/bestofrussia/scientists.html|work=TRISTARMEDIA {{!}} Web Design, Web Development, Multimedia, Creative Web Solutions|accessdate=21 October 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903172506/http://www.tristarmedia.com/bestofrussia/scientists.html|archivedate=3 September 2011}}</ref> \nShe was tutored privately in elementary mathematics by Iosif Ignatevich Malevich.\n\nThe physicist Nikolai Nikanorovich Tyrtov noted her unusual\naptitude when she managed to understand his textbook by discovering for herself an approximate construction of trigonometric functions\nwhich she had not yet encountered in her studies.<ref>F.

Korvin-Krukovskii, \"Sofia Vasilevna Korvin-Krukovskaia,\" ''Russkaia Starina'', vol. 71, no. 9 (1891), p. 623-636.</ref> Tyrtov called her a \"new Pascal\" and suggested she be given a chance to pursue further studies under the tutelage of N. Strannoliubskii.<ref>Rappaport, Karen D. \"S. Kovalevsky: A Mathematical Lesson.\" The American Mathematical Monthly 88 (October 1981): 564-573.</ref> In 1866-67 she spent much of the winter with her family in St. Petersburg, where she was provided private tutoring by Strannoliubskii, a well-known advocate of higher education for women, who taught her calculus. During that same period, the son of a local priest introduced her [[Anne Jaclard|sister Anna]] to progressive ideas influenced by the \"[[Narodniks|Movement of the 1860's]]\", providing her with copies of radical journals of the time discussing [[nihilism#Russian nihilist movement|nihilism]].<ref>Sofya Kovalevskaya, ''A Russian Childhood'', translated, edited, and introduced by Beatrice Stillman ; with an analysis of Kovalevskaya's Mathematics by P.

For the nihilists, science appeared to be the most effective means of helping the mass of people to a better life.  Science pushed back the barriers of religion and superstition, and \"proved\" through the theory of evolution that (peaceful) social revolutions were the way of nature.  For the early nihilists, science was virtually synonymous with truth, progress and radicalism; thus, the pursuit of a scientific career was viewed in no way as a hindrance to social activism.  In fact, it was seen as a positive boost to progressive forces, an active blow against backwardness.<ref name=\"ahk2\">Ann Hibner Koblitz, ''Science, Women and Revolution in Russia'', Routledge, 2000.</ref>{{rp|2\u20134}} }}\n\nDespite her obvious talent for mathematics, she could not complete her education in Russia. At that time, women were not allowed to attend universities in Russia and most other countries.  In order to study abroad, Kovalevskaya needed written permission from her father (or husband). Accordingly, in 1868 she contracted a \"fictitious marriage\" with [[Vladimir Kovalevskij]], a young paleontology student, book publisher and radical, who was the first to translate and publish the works of [[Charles Darwin]] in Russia. They moved from Russia to Germany in 1869, after a brief stay in Vienna, in order to pursue advanced studies.<ref name=RCooke>Roger Cooke, ''The Mathematics of Sonya Kovalevskaya'', Springer-Verlag, 1984.</ref>\n\n==Student years==\nIn April 1869, following Sofia's and Vladimir's brief stay in Vienna, where she attended lectures in physics at the university, they moved to Heidelberg. Through great efforts, she obtained \npermission to audit classes with the professors' approval at the [[University of Heidelberg]].  There she attended courses in physics and mathematics under such teachers as [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] and [[Robert Bunsen]].<ref name=\"ahk1\"/>{{rp|87\u201389}}  Vladimir, meanwhile, went on to\nthe University of Jena to pursue a doctorate in paleontology.\n\nIn October 1869, shortly after attending courses in Heidelberg, she visited London with Vladimir, who spent time with his colleagues [[Thomas Huxley]] and [[Charles Darwin]], while she was invited to attend [[George Eliot]]'s Sunday salons.<ref name=\"RCooke\"/> There, at age nineteen, she met [[Herbert Spencer]] and was led into a debate, at Eliot's instigation, on \"woman's capacity for abstract thought\".  Although there is no record of the details of their conversation, she had just completed a lecture course in Heidelberg on mechanics, and  she may just possibly have made mention of the Euler equations governing the motion of a rigid body (see following section).  George Eliot was writing ''[[Middlemarch]]'' at the time, in which one finds the remarkable sentence: \"In short, woman was a problem which, since Mr. Brooke's mind felt blank before it, could hardly be less complicated than the revolutions of an irregular solid.\"<ref>George Eliot (Mary Ann Evans), ''Middlemarch'', Chapter IV, last sentence.</ref>   This was well before she made her notable contribution of the \"[[Kovalevskaya Top|Kovalevskaya top]]\" to the brief list of known examples of integrable rigid body motion (see following section).\n\nIn October 1870, Kovalevskaya moved to Berlin, where she began to take private lessons with [[Karl Weierstrass]], since the university would not allow her even to audit classes. He was very impressed\nwith her mathematical skills, and over the subsequent three years taught her the same material that comprised his lectures at the university.\n\nIn 1871 she briefly traveled to Paris together with Vladimir in order to help in the [[Paris Commune]], where Kovalevskaya attended the injured and her sister Anyuta was active in the Commune.<ref name=\"ahk1\"/>{{rp|104\u2013106}} With the fall of the Commune, however, both Anyuta and her common law husband [[Victor Jaclard]], who was leader of the Montmartre contingent of the National Guard and a prominent Blanquiste, were arrested. Although Anyuta managed to escape to London, Jaclard was sentenced to execution. However, with the assistance of Sofia's and Anyuta's father General Krukovsky, who had come urgently to Paris to help Anyuta and who wrote to Adolphe Thiers asking for clemency, they managed to save [[Victor Jaclard]].<ref name=\"ahk1\"/>{{rp|107\u2013108}}\n\nKovalevskaya returned to Berlin and continued her studies with Weierstrass for three more years. In 1874 she presented three papers\u2014on [[partial differential equation]]s, on the dynamics of [[Saturn]]'s [[Rings of Saturn|rings]], and on [[elliptic integral]]s\u2014to the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]] as her doctoral dissertation. With the support of Weierstrass, this earned her a doctorate in mathematics ''summa cum laude'', after Weierstrass succeeded in having her exempted from the usual oral examinations.<ref name=\"RCooke\"/>\n\nKovalevskaya thereby became the first woman to have been awarded a doctorate at a European university. Her paper on partial differential equations contains what is now commonly known as the [[Cauchy\u2013Kovalevskaya theorem]], which proves the existence and analyticity\nof local solutions to such equations under suitably defined initial/boundary conditions.\n\n==Last years in Germany and Sweden==\n[[File:Sofya Vasilyevna Kovalevskaya Bust.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Bust by Finnish sculptor [[Walter Runeberg]]]]\n[[Image:Sofia Kovalevskaya grave.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Kovalevskaya's grave, [[Norra begravningsplatsen]]]]\n\nIn 1874, Kovalevskaya and her husband Vladimir returned to Russia, but Vladimir failed to secure a professorship because of his radical beliefs. (Kovalevskaya never would have been considered for such a position because of her gender.)  During this time they tried a variety of schemes to support themselves, including real estate development and involvement with an oil company.  But in the late 1870s they developed financial problems, leading to bankruptcy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kochina|first=Pelageya|title=Love and Mathematics: Sofia Kovalevskaya|year=1985|publisher=Mir Publisher|location=Moscow}}</ref><ref name=\"ahk1\"/>\n\nIn 1875, for some unknown reason, perhaps the death of her father, Sofia and Vladimir decided to spend several years together as an actual married couple. Three years later their daughter, Sofia (called \"Fufa\"), was born. After almost two years devoted to raising her daughter, Kovalevskaya put Fufa under the care of relatives and friends, resumed her work in mathematics, and left Vladimir for what would be the last time.\n\nVladimir, who had always suffered severe mood swings, became more unstable. In 1883, faced with worsening mood swings and the possibility of being prosecuted for his role in a stock swindle, Vladimir committed suicide.<ref name=\"RCooke\"/>\n\nThat year, with the help of the mathematician [[G\u00f6sta Mittag-Leffler]], whom she had known as a fellow student of [[Karl Weierstrass|Weierstrass]], Kovalevskaya was able to secure a position as a ''privat-docent'' at [[Stockholm University]] in Sweden.<ref name=\"RCooke\"/> Kovalevskaya met Mittag-Leffler's sister, the actress, novelist, and playwright [[Anne Charlotte Leffler|Anne Charlotte Edgren-Leffler]].

He was a member of the minor nobility, of mixed (Bela)Russian\u2013Polish descent (Polish on his father's side), with possible partial ancestry from the [[Hunyadi family|royal Corvin family of Hungary]], and served as Marshall of Nobility for Vitebsk province.

Her maternal great grandfather was the astronomer and geographer [[Theodor von Schubert|Friedrich Theodor Schubert]] (1758\u22121825), who emigrated to Russia from Germany around 1785. He became a full member of the St. Petersburg Academy of Science and head of its astronomical observatory. His son, Kovalevskaya's maternal grandfather, was General [[Friedrich von Schubert|Theodor Friedrich von Schubert]] (1789\u22121865), who was head of the military topographic service, and an honorary member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, as well as Director of the Kunstkamera museum.\n\nKovalevskaya's parents provided her with a good early education.  At various times, her governesses were native speakers of English, French, and German. \nWhen she was 8 or 9 years old, she was intrigued by a foretaste of what she was to learn later in her lessons in calculus; the wall of her room had been papered with pages from lecture notes by [[Mikhail Ostrogradsky|Ostrogradsky]], left over from her father's student days.<ref>{{cite web|title=Best of Russia --- Famous Russians --- Scientists.|url=http://www.tristarmedia.com/bestofrussia/scientists.html|work=TRISTARMEDIA {{!}} Web Design, Web Development, Multimedia, Creative Web Solutions|accessdate=21 October 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903172506/http://www.tristarmedia.com/bestofrussia/scientists.html|archivedate=3 September 2011}}</ref> \nShe was tutored privately in elementary mathematics by Iosif Ignatevich Malevich.\n\nThe physicist Nikolai Nikanorovich Tyrtov noted her unusual\naptitude when she managed to understand his textbook by discovering for herself an approximate construction of trigonometric functions\nwhich she had not yet encountered in her studies.<ref>F.

During that same period, the son of a local priest introduced her [[Anne Jaclard|sister Anna]] to progressive ideas influenced by the \"[[Narodniks|Movement of the 1860's]]\", providing her with copies of radical journals of the time discussing [[nihilism#Russian nihilist movement|nihilism]].<ref>Sofya Kovalevskaya, ''A Russian Childhood'', translated, edited, and introduced by Beatrice Stillman ; with an analysis of Kovalevskaya's Mathematics by P.

For the nihilists, science appeared to be the most effective means of helping the mass of people to a better life.  Science pushed back the barriers of religion and superstition, and \"proved\" through the theory of evolution that (peaceful) social revolutions were the way of nature.  For the early nihilists, science was virtually synonymous with truth, progress and radicalism; thus, the pursuit of a scientific career was viewed in no way as a hindrance to social activism.

At that time, women were not allowed to attend universities in Russia and most other countries.  In order to study abroad, Kovalevskaya needed written permission from her father (or husband). Accordingly, in 1868 she contracted a \"fictitious marriage\" with [[Vladimir Kovalevskij]], a young paleontology student, book publisher and radical, who was the first to translate and publish the works of [[Charles Darwin]] in Russia. They moved from Russia to Germany in 1869, after a brief stay in Vienna, in order to pursue advanced studies.<ref name=RCooke>Roger Cooke, ''The Mathematics of Sonya Kovalevskaya'', Springer-Verlag, 1984.</ref>\n\n==Student years==\nIn April 1869, following Sofia's and Vladimir's brief stay in Vienna, where she attended lectures in physics at the university, they moved to Heidelberg. Through great efforts, she obtained \npermission to audit classes with the professors' approval at the [[University of Heidelberg]].  There she attended courses in physics and mathematics under such teachers as [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] and [[Robert Bunsen]].<ref name=\"ahk1\"/>{{rp|87\u201389}}  Vladimir, meanwhile, went on to\nthe University of Jena to pursue a doctorate in paleontology.\n\nIn October 1869, shortly after attending courses in Heidelberg, she visited London with Vladimir, who spent time with his colleagues [[Thomas Huxley]] and [[Charles Darwin]], while she was invited to attend [[George Eliot]]'s Sunday salons.<ref name=\"RCooke\"/> There, at age nineteen, she met [[Herbert Spencer]] and was led into a debate, at Eliot's instigation, on \"woman's capacity for abstract thought\".  Although there is no record of the details of their conversation, she had just completed a lecture course in Heidelberg on mechanics, and  she may just possibly have made mention of the Euler equations governing the motion of a rigid body (see following section).  George Eliot was writing ''[[Middlemarch]]'' at the time, in which one finds the remarkable sentence: \"In short, woman was a problem which, since Mr. Brooke's mind felt blank before it, could hardly be less complicated than the revolutions of an irregular solid.\"<ref>George Eliot (Mary Ann Evans), ''Middlemarch'', Chapter IV, last sentence.</ref>   This was well before she made her notable contribution of the \"[[Kovalevskaya Top|Kovalevskaya top]]\" to the brief list of known examples of integrable rigid body motion (see following section).\n\nIn October 1870, Kovalevskaya moved to Berlin, where she began to take private lessons with [[Karl Weierstrass]], since the university would not allow her even to audit classes. He was very impressed\nwith her mathematical skills, and over the subsequent three years taught her the same material that comprised his lectures at the university.\n\nIn 1871 she briefly traveled to Paris together with Vladimir in order to help in the [[Paris Commune]], where Kovalevskaya attended the injured and her sister Anyuta was active in the Commune.<ref name=\"ahk1\"/>{{rp|104\u2013106}} With the fall of the Commune, however, both Anyuta and her common law husband [[Victor Jaclard]], who was leader of the Montmartre contingent of the National Guard and a prominent Blanquiste, were arrested. Although Anyuta managed to escape to London, Jaclard was sentenced to execution. However, with the assistance of Sofia's and Anyuta's father General Krukovsky, who had come urgently to Paris to help Anyuta and who wrote to Adolphe Thiers asking for clemency, they managed to save [[Victor Jaclard]].<ref name=\"ahk1\"/>{{rp|107\u2013108}}\n\nKovalevskaya returned to Berlin and continued her studies with Weierstrass for three more years. In 1874 she presented three papers\u2014on [[partial differential equation]]s, on the dynamics of [[Saturn]]'s [[Rings of Saturn|rings]], and on [[elliptic integral]]s\u2014to the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]] as her doctoral dissertation. With the support of Weierstrass, this earned her a doctorate in mathematics ''summa cum laude'', after Weierstrass succeeded in having her exempted from the usual oral examinations.<ref name=\"RCooke\"/>\n\nKovalevskaya thereby became the first woman to have been awarded a doctorate at a European university. Her paper on partial differential equations contains what is now commonly known as the [[Cauchy\u2013Kovalevskaya theorem]], which proves the existence and analyticity\nof local solutions to such equations under suitably defined initial/boundary conditions.\n\n==Last years in Germany and Sweden==\n[[File:Sofya Vasilyevna Kovalevskaya Bust.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Bust by Finnish sculptor [[Walter Runeberg]]]]\n[[Image:Sofia Kovalevskaya grave.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Kovalevskaya's grave, [[Norra begravningsplatsen]]]]\n\nIn 1874, Kovalevskaya and her husband Vladimir returned to Russia, but Vladimir failed to secure a professorship because of his radical beliefs. (Kovalevskaya never would have been considered for such a position because of her gender.)  During this time they tried a variety of schemes to support themselves, including real estate development and involvement with an oil company.  But in the late 1870s they developed financial problems, leading to bankruptcy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kochina|first=Pelageya|title=Love and Mathematics: Sofia Kovalevskaya|year=1985|publisher=Mir Publisher|location=Moscow}}</ref><ref name=\"ahk1\"/>\n\nIn 1875, for some unknown reason, perhaps the death of her father, Sofia and Vladimir decided to spend several years together as an actual married couple. Three years later their daughter, Sofia (called \"Fufa\"), was born. After almost two years devoted to raising her daughter, Kovalevskaya put Fufa under the care of relatives and friends, resumed her work in mathematics, and left Vladimir for what would be the last time.\n\nVladimir, who had always suffered severe mood swings, became more unstable. In 1883, faced with worsening mood swings and the possibility of being prosecuted for his role in a stock swindle, Vladimir committed suicide.<ref name=\"RCooke\"/>\n\nThat year, with the help of the mathematician [[G\u00f6sta Mittag-Leffler]], whom she had known as a fellow student of [[Karl Weierstrass|Weierstrass]], Kovalevskaya was able to secure a position as a ''privat-docent'' at [[Stockholm University]] in Sweden.<ref name=\"RCooke\"/> Kovalevskaya met Mittag-Leffler's sister, the actress, novelist, and playwright [[Anne Charlotte Leffler|Anne Charlotte Edgren-Leffler]]. Until Kovalevskaya's death the two women shared a close friendship.<ref>McFadden, Margaret. ''Golden Cables of Sympathy: The Transatlantic Sources of Nineteenth-Century Feminism.'' University Press of Kentucky, 1999.</ref>\n\nIn 1884 Kovalevskaya was appointed to a five-year position as Extraordinary Professor (assistant professor in modern terminology) and became an editor of [[Acta Mathematica]]. In 1888 she won the ''Prix Bordin'' of the French Academy of Science, for her work \"M\u00e9moire sur un cas particulier du probl\u00e8me de la rotation d'un corps pesant autour d'un point fixe, o\u00f9 l'int\u00e9gration s'effectue \u00e0 l'aide des fonctions ultraelliptiques du temps\".<ref name=RCooke/><ref>Sof\u02b9ja Vasil\u02b9evna Kovalevskaja, ''[https://books.google.ca/books/about/M%C3%A9moire_sur_un_cas_particulier_du_probl.html?id=8r72rQEACAAJ&redir_esc=y M\u00e9moire sur un cas particulier du probl\u00e8me de la rotation d'un corps pesant autour d'un point fixe o\u00f9 l'int\u00e9gration s'effectue \u00e0 l'aide de fonctions ultraelliptiques du temps]'', IMprimerie nationale, 1894</ref> Her submission featured the celebrated discovery of what is now known as the \"[[Kovalevskaya top]]\", which was subsequently shown to be the only other case of [[rigid body]] motion that is \"completely [[integrable systems|integrable]]\" other than the tops of [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] and [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]].<ref name=cooke>{{Cite book| last = Cooke | first = Roger | title = The Mathematics of Sonya Kovalevskaya  | publisher = Springer | year = 1984 | page = 159| isbn = 9781461297666}}</ref>\n\nIn 1889 Kovalevskaya was appointed Ordinary Professor (full professor) at Stockholm University, the first woman in Europe in modern times to hold such a position.<ref name=\"ahk1\"/>{{rp|218}} After much lobbying on her behalf (and a change in the Academy's rules) she was made a Corresponding Member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], but she was never offered a professorship in Russia.\n\nKovalevskaya, who was involved in the vibrant, politically progressive and feminist currents of late nineteenth-century Russian nihilism, wrote several non-mathematical works as well, including a memoir, ''A Russian Childhood'', two plays (in collaboration with Duchess Anne Charlotte Edgren-Leffler) and a partly autobiographical novel, ''Nihilist Girl'' (1890).\n\nIn 1889, Kovalevskaya fell in love with [[Maksim Kovalevsky|Maxim Kovalevsky]], a distant relation of her deceased husband,<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Math and mathematicians : the history of math discoveries around the world|last=Bruno|first=Leonard C.|date=2003|origyear=1999|publisher=U X L|others=Baker, Lawrence W.|isbn=0787638145|location=Detroit, Mich.|pages=251|oclc=41497065}}</ref> but insisted on not marrying him because she would not be able to settle down and live with him.<ref name=\"rlc\"/>{{rp|18}}\n\nKovalevskaya died of [[1889\u20131890 flu pandemic|influenza]] complicated by pneumonia in 1891 at age forty-one, after returning from a vacation in Nice with Maxim.<ref name=\"ahk1\"/>{{rp|231}} She is buried in [[Solna Municipality|Solna]], Sweden, at [[Norra begravningsplatsen]].\n\nKovalevskaya's mathematical results, such as the [[Cauchy\u2013Kowalevski theorem]], and her pioneering role as a female mathematician in an almost exclusively male-dominated field, have made her the subject of several books, including a biography by Ann Hibner Koblitz,<ref name=\"ahk1\"/> a biography in Russian by Polubarinova-Kochina<ref>P.
