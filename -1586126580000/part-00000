The areas of Denmark and Norway remained under the same monarch until 1814, [[Denmark\u2013Norway]]. Beginning in the 17th century, there were several devastating wars with the [[Swedish Empire]], ending with large [[cession]]s of territory to Sweden. After the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Norway was ceded to Sweden, while Denmark kept the Faroe Islands, Greenland, and [[Iceland]]. In the 19th century there was a surge of [[19th century in Denmark|nationalist movements]], which were defeated in the [[First Schleswig War]]. After the [[Second Schleswig War]] in 1864, Denmark lost the [[Duchy of Schleswig]] to Prussia. Denmark remained neutral during [[World War I]], however, in 1920 the northern half of Schleswig became Danish again. In April 1940, a [[German invasion of Denmark (1940)|German invasion]] saw brief [[military]] skirmishes while the [[Danish resistance movement]] was active from 1943 until the [[Occupation of Denmark#Hardship and the end of the war|German surrender]] in May 1945. An industrialised exporter of [[Agriculture|agricultural]] produce in the second half of the 19th century, Denmark introduced [[Kanslergade Agreement|social and labour-market reforms]] in the early 20th century that created the basis for the present [[welfare state]] [[Nordic model|model]] with a highly developed [[mixed economy]].\n\nThe [[Constitution of Denmark]] was signed on 5 June 1849, ending the [[absolute monarchy]], which had begun in 1660. It establishes a [[constitutional monarchy]] organised as a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] democracy. The [[Politics of Denmark|government]] and [[Folketing|national parliament]] are seated in [[Copenhagen]], the nation's [[capital city|capital]], [[list of cities in Denmark by population|largest city]], and main commercial centre. Denmark exercises [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] influence in the [[Danish Realm]], [[devolution|devolving]] powers to handle internal affairs. [[Home rule]] was established in the Faroe Islands\nin 1948; in [[Greenland]] home rule was established in 1979 and [[2008 Greenlandic self-government referendum|further autonomy]] in 2009. Denmark became a member of the [[European Economic Community]] (now the [[European Union|EU]]) in 1973, but negotiated [[Opt-outs in the European Union|certain opt-outs]]; it retains its own currency, the [[Danish krone|krone]]. It is among the founding members of [[NATO]], the [[Nordic Council]], the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]], and the [[United Nations]]; it is also part of the [[Schengen Area]]. Denmark has close ties to its Scandinavian neighbours also linguistically, with the [[Danish language]] being partially [[mutually intelligible]] with both [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]].\n\nDenmark is considered to be one of the most economically and socially developed countries in the world.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/22/denmark-happiest-country_n_4070761.html|title=Denmark Is Considered The Happiest Country.

From the 16th century, Dutch and Flemish designers were brought to Denmark, initially to improve the country's fortifications, but increasingly to build magnificent royal castles and palaces in the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] style.\nDuring the 17th century, many impressive buildings were built in the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style, both in the capital and the provinces. [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassicism]] from France was slowly adopted by native Danish architects who increasingly participated in defining architectural style. A productive period of [[Historicism (art)|Historicism]] ultimately merged into the 19th-century [[National Romantic style]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitdenmark.com/irland/en-ie/menu/turist/inspiration/detkulturelledanmark/arkitektur/danish-architecture-an-overview.htm |title=Danish Architecture: An Overview |accessdate=19 July 2011 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719130528/http://www.visitdenmark.com/irland/en-ie/menu/turist/inspiration/detkulturelledanmark/arkitektur/danish-architecture-an-overview.htm |archivedate=19 July 2011 |df=dmy }}, ''Visit Denmark''.

Danish design is typically applied to industrial design, furniture and household objects, which have won many international awards. The [[Royal Copenhagen|Royal Porcelain Factory]] is famous for the quality of its ceramics and export products worldwide. Danish design is also a well-known brand, often associated with world-famous, 20th-century designers and architects such as [[B\u00f8rge Mogensen]], [[Finn Juhl]], [[Hans Wegner]], [[Arne Jacobsen]], [[Poul Henningsen]] and [[Verner Panton]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100522002856/http://en.ddc.dk/denmarkbydesign \"Danish by Design\"], ''DDC''.

[[Saxo Grammaticus]], normally considered the first Danish writer, worked for bishop [[Absalon]] on a chronicle of [[History of Denmark|Danish history]] (''[[Gesta Danorum]]''). Very little is known of other Danish literature from the [[Middle Ages]]. With the [[Age of Enlightenment]] came [[Ludvig Holberg]] whose comedy plays are still being performed.\n\nIn the late 19th century, literature was seen as a way to influence society. Known as the [[Modern Breakthrough]], this movement was championed by [[Georg Brandes]], [[Henrik Pontoppidan]] (awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]) and [[Jens Peter Jacobsen|J.&nbsp;P. Jacobsen]]. [[Romanticism]] influenced the renowned writer and poet [[Hans Christian Andersen]], known for his stories and [[fairy tale]]s, e.g. ''[[The Ugly Duckling]]'', ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'' and ''[[The Snow Queen]]''. In recent history [[Johannes Vilhelm Jensen]] was also awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]. [[Karen Blixen]] is famous for her novels and short stories. Other Danish writers of importance are [[Herman Bang]], [[Gustav Wied]], [[William Heinesen]], [[Martin Andersen Nex\u00f8]], [[Piet Hein (Denmark)|Piet Hein]], [[Hans Scherfig]], [[Klaus Rifbjerg]], [[Dan Tur\u00e8ll]], [[Tove Ditlevsen]], [[Inger Christensen]] and [[Peter H\u00f8eg]].\n\nDanish philosophy has a long tradition as part of [[Western philosophy]]. Perhaps the most influential Danish philosopher was [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]], the creator of [[Christian existentialism]]. Kierkegaard had a few Danish followers, including [[Harald H\u00f8ffding]], who later in his life moved on to join the movement of [[positivism]]. Among Kierkegaard's other followers include [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] who was impressed with Kierkegaard's views on the individual, and [[Rollo May]], who helped create [[humanistic psychology]]. Another Danish philosopher of note is [[N. F. S. Grundtvig|Grundtvig]], whose philosophy gave rise to a new form of non-aggressive nationalism in Denmark, and who is also influential for his theological and historical works.\n\n=== Painting and photography ===\n{{Main|Danish art|Photography in Denmark}}\n[[File:C W Eckersberg 1841 - Kvinde foran et spejl.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''Woman in Front of a Mirror'', (1841), by [[Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg]]]]\n\nWhile Danish art was influenced over the centuries by trends in Germany and the Netherlands, the 15th and 16th century [[church frescos in Denmark|church frescos]], which can be seen in many of the country's older churches, are of particular interest as they were painted in a style typical of native Danish painters.<ref>[http://www.panoramas.dk/kalkmalerier/ Wall Paintings in Danish Churches from Panoramas.dk] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128170607/http://www.panoramas.dk/kalkmalerier/ |date=28 November 2009 }}.

These include [[impressionism]] and the modernist styles of [[expressionism]], [[abstract painting]] and [[surrealism]]. While international co-operation and activity has almost always been essential to the Danish artistic community, influential art collectives with a firm Danish base includes [[De Tretten]] (1909\u20131912), [[Linien]] (1930s and 1940s), [[COBRA (avant-garde movement)|COBRA]] (1948\u20131951), [[Fluxus]] (1960s and 1970s), [[Junge Wilde|De Unge Vilde]] (1980s) and more recently [[Superflex]] (founded in 1993). Most Danish painters of modern times have also been very active with other forms of artistic expressions, such as sculpting, ceramics, art installations, activism, film and experimental architecture. Notable Danish painters from modern times representing various [[art movements]] include [[Theodor Philipsen]] (1840\u20131920, impressionism and naturalism), [[Anna Klindt S\u00f8rensen]] (1899\u20131985, expressionism), [[Franciska Clausen]] (1899\u20131986, Neue Sachlichkeit, cubism, surrealism and others), [[Henry Heerup]] (1907\u20131993, naivism), [[Robert Jacobsen]] (1912\u20131993, abstract painting), [[Carl Henning Pedersen]] (1913\u20132007, abstract painting), [[Asger Jorn]] (1914\u20131973, Situationist, abstract painting), [[Bj\u00f8rn Wiinblad]] (1918\u20132006, art deco, orientalism), [[Per Kirkeby]] (b. 1938, neo-expressionism, abstract painting), [[Per Arnoldi]] (b. 1941, pop art), [[Michael Kvium]] (b. 1955, neo-surrealism) and Simone Aaberg K\u00e6rn (b. 1969, superrealism).\n\nDanish photography has developed from strong participation and interest in the very beginnings of the [[history of photography|art of photography]] in 1839 to the success of a considerable number of Danes in the world of photography today. Pioneers such as [[Mads Alstrup]] and [[Georg Emil Hansen]] paved the way for a rapidly growing profession during the last half of the 19th century.

The areas of Denmark and Norway remained under the same monarch until 1814, [[Denmark\u2013Norway]]. Beginning in the 17th century, there were several devastating wars with the [[Swedish Empire]], ending with large [[cession]]s of territory to Sweden. After the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Norway was ceded to Sweden, while Denmark kept the Faroe Islands, Greenland, and [[Iceland]]. In the 19th century there was a surge of [[19th century in Denmark|nationalist movements]], which were defeated in the [[First Schleswig War]]. After the [[Second Schleswig War]] in 1864, Denmark lost the [[Duchy of Schleswig]] to Prussia. Denmark remained neutral during [[World War I]], however, in 1920 the northern half of Schleswig became Danish again. In April 1940, a [[German invasion of Denmark (1940)|German invasion]] saw brief [[military]] skirmishes while the [[Danish resistance movement]] was active from 1943 until the [[Occupation of Denmark#Hardship and the end of the war|German surrender]] in May 1945. An industrialised exporter of [[Agriculture|agricultural]] produce in the second half of the 19th century, Denmark introduced [[Kanslergade Agreement|social and labour-market reforms]] in the early 20th century that created the basis for the present [[welfare state]] [[Nordic model|model]] with a highly developed [[mixed economy]].\n\nThe [[Constitution of Denmark]] was signed on 5 June 1849, ending the [[absolute monarchy]], which had begun in 1660. It establishes a [[constitutional monarchy]] organised as a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] democracy. The [[Politics of Denmark|government]] and [[Folketing|national parliament]] are seated in [[Copenhagen]], the nation's [[capital city|capital]], [[list of cities in Denmark by population|largest city]], and main commercial centre. Denmark exercises [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] influence in the [[Danish Realm]], [[devolution|devolving]] powers to handle internal affairs. [[Home rule]] was established in the Faroe Islands\nin 1948; in [[Greenland]] home rule was established in 1979 and [[2008 Greenlandic self-government referendum|further autonomy]] in 2009.

The latter are due to the many protection laws and protected areas of significance within the country even though the EPI is not considering how well these laws and regulations are affecting the current biodiversity and habitats in reality; one of many weaknesses in the EPI.<ref>Nor does the EPI gauge how well the biodiversity is faring compared to a pristine situation.</ref> Denmark performs worst (i.e. highest ranking) in the areas of environmental effects of fisheries (128)<ref>This is 128 out of only 136 countries, as only 136 countries are represented in this area of the EPI report.</ref> and forest management (96).

[[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassicism]] from France was slowly adopted by native Danish architects who increasingly participated in defining architectural style. A productive period of [[Historicism (art)|Historicism]] ultimately merged into the 19th-century [[National Romantic style]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitdenmark.com/irland/en-ie/menu/turist/inspiration/detkulturelledanmark/arkitektur/danish-architecture-an-overview.htm |title=Danish Architecture: An Overview |accessdate=19 July 2011 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719130528/http://www.visitdenmark.com/irland/en-ie/menu/turist/inspiration/detkulturelledanmark/arkitektur/danish-architecture-an-overview.htm |archivedate=19 July 2011 |df=dmy }}, ''Visit Denmark''.

Danish design is typically applied to industrial design, furniture and household objects, which have won many international awards. The [[Royal Copenhagen|Royal Porcelain Factory]] is famous for the quality of its ceramics and export products worldwide. Danish design is also a well-known brand, often associated with world-famous, 20th-century designers and architects such as [[B\u00f8rge Mogensen]], [[Finn Juhl]], [[Hans Wegner]], [[Arne Jacobsen]], [[Poul Henningsen]] and [[Verner Panton]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100522002856/http://en.ddc.dk/denmarkbydesign \"Danish by Design\"], ''DDC''.

[[Saxo Grammaticus]], normally considered the first Danish writer, worked for bishop [[Absalon]] on a chronicle of [[History of Denmark|Danish history]] (''[[Gesta Danorum]]''). Very little is known of other Danish literature from the [[Middle Ages]]. With the [[Age of Enlightenment]] came [[Ludvig Holberg]] whose comedy plays are still being performed.\n\nIn the late 19th century, literature was seen as a way to influence society. Known as the [[Modern Breakthrough]], this movement was championed by [[Georg Brandes]], [[Henrik Pontoppidan]] (awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]) and [[Jens Peter Jacobsen|J.&nbsp;P. Jacobsen]]. [[Romanticism]] influenced the renowned writer and poet [[Hans Christian Andersen]], known for his stories and [[fairy tale]]s, e.g. ''[[The Ugly Duckling]]'', ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'' and ''[[The Snow Queen]]''. In recent history [[Johannes Vilhelm Jensen]] was also awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]. [[Karen Blixen]] is famous for her novels and short stories. Other Danish writers of importance are [[Herman Bang]], [[Gustav Wied]], [[William Heinesen]], [[Martin Andersen Nex\u00f8]], [[Piet Hein (Denmark)|Piet Hein]], [[Hans Scherfig]], [[Klaus Rifbjerg]], [[Dan Tur\u00e8ll]], [[Tove Ditlevsen]], [[Inger Christensen]] and [[Peter H\u00f8eg]].\n\nDanish philosophy has a long tradition as part of [[Western philosophy]]. Perhaps the most influential Danish philosopher was [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]], the creator of [[Christian existentialism]]. Kierkegaard had a few Danish followers, including [[Harald H\u00f8ffding]], who later in his life moved on to join the movement of [[positivism]]. Among Kierkegaard's other followers include [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] who was impressed with Kierkegaard's views on the individual, and [[Rollo May]], who helped create [[humanistic psychology]]. Another Danish philosopher of note is [[N. F. S. Grundtvig|Grundtvig]], whose philosophy gave rise to a new form of non-aggressive nationalism in Denmark, and who is also influential for his theological and historical works.\n\n=== Painting and photography ===\n{{Main|Danish art|Photography in Denmark}}\n[[File:C W Eckersberg 1841 - Kvinde foran et spejl.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''Woman in Front of a Mirror'', (1841), by [[Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg]]]]\n\nWhile Danish art was influenced over the centuries by trends in Germany and the Netherlands, the 15th and 16th century [[church frescos in Denmark|church frescos]], which can be seen in many of the country's older churches, are of particular interest as they were painted in a style typical of native Danish painters.<ref>[http://www.panoramas.dk/kalkmalerier/ Wall Paintings in Danish Churches from Panoramas.dk] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128170607/http://www.panoramas.dk/kalkmalerier/ |date=28 November 2009 }}.

These include [[impressionism]] and the modernist styles of [[expressionism]], [[abstract painting]] and [[surrealism]]. While international co-operation and activity has almost always been essential to the Danish artistic community, influential art collectives with a firm Danish base includes [[De Tretten]] (1909\u20131912), [[Linien]] (1930s and 1940s), [[COBRA (avant-garde movement)|COBRA]] (1948\u20131951), [[Fluxus]] (1960s and 1970s), [[Junge Wilde|De Unge Vilde]] (1980s) and more recently [[Superflex]] (founded in 1993). Most Danish painters of modern times have also been very active with other forms of artistic expressions, such as sculpting, ceramics, art installations, activism, film and experimental architecture. Notable Danish painters from modern times representing various [[art movements]] include [[Theodor Philipsen]] (1840\u20131920, impressionism and naturalism), [[Anna Klindt S\u00f8rensen]] (1899\u20131985, expressionism), [[Franciska Clausen]] (1899\u20131986, Neue Sachlichkeit, cubism, surrealism and others), [[Henry Heerup]] (1907\u20131993, naivism), [[Robert Jacobsen]] (1912\u20131993, abstract painting), [[Carl Henning Pedersen]] (1913\u20132007, abstract painting), [[Asger Jorn]] (1914\u20131973, Situationist, abstract painting), [[Bj\u00f8rn Wiinblad]] (1918\u20132006, art deco, orientalism), [[Per Kirkeby]] (b. 1938, neo-expressionism, abstract painting), [[Per Arnoldi]] (b. 1941, pop art), [[Michael Kvium]] (b. 1955, neo-surrealism) and Simone Aaberg K\u00e6rn (b. 1969, superrealism).\n\nDanish photography has developed from strong participation and interest in the very beginnings of the [[history of photography|art of photography]] in 1839 to the success of a considerable number of Danes in the world of photography today. Pioneers such as [[Mads Alstrup]] and [[Georg Emil Hansen]] paved the way for a rapidly growing profession during the last half of the 19th century.

He was raised in the [[Royal Borough of Greenwich|borough of Greenwich]] (Thamesmead), where he began [[performing arts]] at an early age of 8, meanwhile writing songs in his spare time. Fahd eventually focused on music & acting from he's a long-existing list of talents such as dancing, singing, sprinting and basketball. Before engaging in music, his primary school appointed him to weekly trumpet lessons. After a prolonged trip to [[Liverpool]], Fahd's family relocated to the county of [[Greater Manchester]] in a town called [[Wythenshawe]].\n\nKing-Fahd attended St Mary's, a catholic [[Independent school|private school]] in Ibn, and, later, Linton Mead Primary School in [[Thamesmead]]. Following the move to [[Manchester]], he transferred from The Halley Academy ([[The Halley Academy|Corelli College)]] to [[Manchester Enterprise Academy]], where he studies sports, musical theatre and business, while also representing his school in all school plays and few basketball & football games.\n\n==Music Career==\nFahd made his debut appearance on an [[Instagram]] freestyle called 'Run the streets down'. After reaching a respectable point of his old channel, Fahd made a new brand channel focusing on all his musical content. Fahd was expected to release a debut [[freestyle]] throughout 2019 \u2018Original Ends (0EnDs)\u2019 as he explained but instead released 2 [[Single (music)|singles]] on he\u2019s YouTube channel. A Christmas special \u2018Wishlist\u2019 and own version of SJ\u2019s \u2018Youngest In Charge\u2019 which both did well in terms of views but in terms of positive feedback, not so well. Shortly the singles were unavailable, deleted. His rebranded himself, changing his professional name from FahdHilfiger to Fahd. Fahd's debut single 'Left on read' blew up around his local area back in [[Wythenshawe]], where he gained attention for the [[Manchester|Mancunian]] youths, talent pages and young stars. 'Left on read' was a very controversial single, some saying it was good for a debut single, some claiming it's too repetitive and annoyingly catchy. The \u2018Left On Read\u2019 meme cooled down mid-February, currently looking to release a debut [[Extended play|EP]] before August 2020.\n\nEarly April Fahd's classmate and peer in [[drill music]] Dxxgz aimed at a rapper in he's [[KSI (entertainer)|Ksi]] #poppinchallenge verse saying, 'You can't rap', 'You man are a couple of p***ks' and 'You chat on snap'. Fahd took it to offence and sensed that it was directed at him, so he followed grime tradition and [[Diss (music)|sent]] for Dxxgz with an Instagram & Snapchat freestyle called 'my response'.\n\nJanuary 2020, Fahd premiered the official audio to his and HJ's (Harrison Johnson) single \"Livin' It\" on [[YouTube]], produced Hudson beats.

W. E. Johns'''. He was the creator of the fictional air-adventurer ''[[Biggles]]''.\n\n==Early life==\nJohns was born in [[Bengeo]], [[Hertford]], England, the son of Richard Eastman Johns, a fabric tailor, and Elizabeth Johns ([[Married and maiden names|n\u00e9e]] Earl), the daughter of a master butcher. A younger brother, Russell Ernest Johns, was born on 24 October 1895. Johns' early ambition was to be a soldier, and he was a crack shot with a rifle. From January 1905, he attended [[Richard Hale School|Hertford Grammar School]].<ref name=johns>{{cite web | url=http://www.wejohns.com/Biography/Biography1/ | title=A Brief Biography of Captain W. E. Johns  Part One | website=Wejohns.com | accessdate=17 October 2012}}</ref> He also attended evening classes at the local art school.\n\nJohns was not a natural scholar. He included some of his experiences at this school in his book ''Biggles Goes to School'' (1951). In the summer of 1907 he was [[Apprenticeship|apprenticed]] to a county municipal [[Surveying|surveyor]] for four years and in 1912 was appointed as a sanitary inspector in [[Swaffham]] in [[Norfolk]]. Soon afterwards, his father died of [[tuberculosis]] at the age of 47. On 6 October 1914 Johns married Maude Penelope Hunt (1882\u20131961), the daughter of the Rev. John Hunt, vicar of [[Little Dunham]], Norfolk.<ref name=johns/> Their only son, William Earl Carmichael Johns, was born in March 1916.\n\n==Military career and the First World War ==\nIn 1913, while living in [[Swaffham]], and working as a sanitary inspector, Johns enlisted in the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] as a [[Trooper (rank)|trooper]] in the [[Norfolk Yeomanry|King's Own Royal Regiment (Norfolk Yeomanry)]].  The regiment was mobilised in August 1914 and was sent overseas in September 1915, embarking on [[RMS Olympic|RMS ''Olympic'']].  The Norfolk Yeomanry fought (as infantry) at [[Battle of Gallipoli|Gallipoli]] until December when they were withdrawn to [[Egypt]].  In September 1916 Johns transferred to the [[Machine Gun Corps]]. While serving on the [[Macedonian front (World War I)|Macedonian front]] in [[Greece]] he was hospitalised with [[malaria]].  After recovering, he was commissioned into the [[Royal Flying Corps]] (RFC) in September 1917 as a temporary [[second lieutenant]]<ref name=\"LG 19 October 1917\">{{London Gazette |issue=30347 |date=19 October 1917 |page=10886 }}</ref>  and posted back to England for flight training.\n\nJohns undertook his initial flying training at the short-lived airfield at [[Coley Park]] in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], flying the [[Farman MF.11|Farman MF.11 Shorthorn]] aircraft. He was then posted to No.25 Flying Training School at [[Thetford]] in Norfolk, closer to where his wife Maude and son Jack were living.<ref name=cpabac>{{cite web | title = The Coley Park Aerodrome and CWS Jam Works | url = http://www.users.on.net/~kevros/coleypark/oc_aerocws.htm | publisher = Coley Park & Beyond (Kevin Rosier)|website=Users.on.net | accessdate =15 February 2008}}</ref>\n \nOn 1 April 1918, Johns was appointed flying instructor at [[Marske-by-the-Sea]] in [[Yorkshire]]. The aircraft of the time were very unreliable and he wrote off three planes in three days through engine failure \u2013 crashing into the sea, then the sand, and then through a fellow officer's back door. Later, he was caught in fog over the [[Tees]], missed [[Hartlepool]] and narrowly escaped flying into a cliff. Shooting one's own propeller off with a forward-mounted machine-gun with malfunctioning [[synchronization gear|synchronisation]] was a fairly common accident, and it happened to Johns twice. The Commanding Officer at Marske was a Major Champion,{{who|date=December 2018}} known as 'Gimlet', a name used later by Johns for the hero of a series of stories. During this time Johns's probationary commission was confirmed<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=30887 |date=6 September 1918 |page=10551}}</ref> and he served as a flying instructor until August 1918 when he transferred to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].\n\nHe performed six weeks of active duty as a bomber pilot with [[No. 55 Squadron RAF]], close to the average in the latter part of the war.<ref>H.A.Jones. ''War in the Air''. Naval and Military Press; New edition (8 Oct 2002)</ref> This squadron was part of the [[Independent Air Force]], a section of the Royal Air Force that had been formed for the purpose of bombing strategic targets deep inside Germany.\n\nOn 16 September 1918 he was piloting one of six [[De Havilland DH4]]s on their way to bomb [[Mannheim]] when his aircraft was hit by anti-aircraft fire and he was forced to drop out of formation. He jettisoned his single {{convert|250|lb|kg|adj=on}} bomb and turned for home, but was attacked by a number of [[Fokker D.VII]] fighters. During a lengthy but one-sided battle, Johns' observer and rear-gunner, Second Lieutenant Alfred Edward Amey, was badly wounded and the aircraft shot down. The victory was credited to [[Georg Weiner]], the commander of [[Jagdstaffel 3]].<ref name=\"Hart\" /> Johns and Amey were taken prisoner by German troops: Johns received a leg wound during the battle and was slightly injured in the crash, but Amey died of his injuries later that day.<ref name=\"Hart\">{{cite book | title=Aces Falling: War Above The Trenches, 1918 | publisher=W&N | author=Hart, Peter | year=2007 | page=278 | isbn=0297846531}}</ref><ref name=\"auction\">{{cite web | url=http://www.invaluable.com/auction-lot/medals-royal-flying-corps-biggles-observer-s-casu-1-c-h46sfkylnv | title=Bosleys 2005, Lot 556 | website=Invaluable.com | accessdate=16 October 2012}}</ref> <ref group=\"Note\">Amey's medals were sold at auction in the United Kingdom in 2005, in a lot that included a letter to his family from Johns, describing the circumstances of his death ''(see: Bosleys 2005, Lot 556)''.

His RAF commission had been extended a further four years and he had moved to [[Birmingham]], again working as a recruitment officer. In Birmingham  he met Doris 'Dol' May Leigh<ref name=johns2 /> (1900\u20131969), daughter of Alfred Broughton Leigh. They later moved to [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] when Johns was posted there. Although he never divorced Maude Hunt, Doris Leigh was known as 'Mrs Johns' until her death. Johns continued to pay for his wife and son's upkeep and for her nursing care (she suffered from acute arthritis).<ref name=johns2 />\n\nOn 15 October 1927, he was transferred to the reserves.<ref name=\"LG 11 October 1927\">{{London Gazette |issue=33319 |date=11 October 1927 |page=6402 }}</ref> Four years later, on 15 October 1931, he relinquished his commission.<ref name=\"LG 22 December 1931\">{{London Gazette |issue=33782 |date=22 December 1931 |page=8260 }}</ref>\n\n==Writing==\n{{see also|List of works by W. E. Johns}}\n<!-- Commented out: [[File:Biggles of 266 cover.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of ''Biggles of 266'']] -->\nW. E. Johns was a prolific author and editor. In his 46-year writing career (1922\u201368) he penned over 160 books, including nearly one hundred Biggles books, more than sixty other novels and factual books, and scores of magazine articles and short stories.\n\nHis first novel, ''Mossyface'',<ref group=\"Note\">Mossy Face was a name given by the Allies to [[Havrincourt|Havrincourt Wood]]: it is mentioned in some of the ''Biggles'' stories and in some pilot's memoirs of the period.</ref> was published in 1922 under the pen name \"William Earle\". After leaving the RAF, Johns became a newspaper air correspondent, as well as editing and illustrating books about flying. At the request of John Hamilton Ltd, he created the magazine ''Popular Flying'' which first appeared in March 1932. It was in the pages of ''Popular Flying'' that Biggles first appeared.\n\nThe first Biggles book, ''The Camels are Coming'' (a reference to the [[Sopwith Camel]] aeroplane), was published in August 1932 and Johns would continue to write Biggles stories until his death in 1968. At first, the Biggles stories were credited to \"William Earle\", but later Johns adopted the more familiar \"Capt. W. E. Johns\".

W. E. Johns'''. He was the creator of the fictional air-adventurer ''[[Biggles]]''.\n\n==Early life==\nJohns was born in [[Bengeo]], [[Hertford]], England, the son of Richard Eastman Johns, a fabric tailor, and Elizabeth Johns ([[Married and maiden names|n\u00e9e]] Earl), the daughter of a master butcher. A younger brother, Russell Ernest Johns, was born on 24 October 1895. Johns' early ambition was to be a soldier, and he was a crack shot with a rifle. From January 1905, he attended [[Richard Hale School|Hertford Grammar School]].<ref name=johns>{{cite web | url=http://www.wejohns.com/Biography/Biography1/ | title=A Brief Biography of Captain W. E. Johns  Part One | website=Wejohns.com | accessdate=17 October 2012}}</ref> He also attended evening classes at the local art school.\n\nJohns was not a natural scholar. He included some of his experiences at this school in his book ''Biggles Goes to School'' (1951). In the summer of 1907 he was [[Apprenticeship|apprenticed]] to a county municipal [[Surveying|surveyor]] for four years and in 1912 was appointed as a sanitary inspector in [[Swaffham]] in [[Norfolk]]. Soon afterwards, his father died of [[tuberculosis]] at the age of 47. On 6 October 1914 Johns married Maude Penelope Hunt (1882\u20131961), the daughter of the Rev. John Hunt, vicar of [[Little Dunham]], Norfolk.<ref name=johns/> Their only son, William Earl Carmichael Johns, was born in March 1916.\n\n==Military career and the First World War ==\nIn 1913, while living in [[Swaffham]], and working as a sanitary inspector, Johns enlisted in the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] as a [[Trooper (rank)|trooper]] in the [[Norfolk Yeomanry|King's Own Royal Regiment (Norfolk Yeomanry)]].  The regiment was mobilised in August 1914 and was sent overseas in September 1915, embarking on [[RMS Olympic|RMS ''Olympic'']].  The Norfolk Yeomanry fought (as infantry) at [[Battle of Gallipoli|Gallipoli]] until December when they were withdrawn to [[Egypt]].  In September 1916 Johns transferred to the [[Machine Gun Corps]]. While serving on the [[Macedonian front (World War I)|Macedonian front]] in [[Greece]] he was hospitalised with [[malaria]].  After recovering, he was commissioned into the [[Royal Flying Corps]] (RFC) in September 1917 as a temporary [[second lieutenant]]<ref name=\"LG 19 October 1917\">{{London Gazette |issue=30347 |date=19 October 1917 |page=10886 }}</ref>  and posted back to England for flight training.\n\nJohns undertook his initial flying training at the short-lived airfield at [[Coley Park]] in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], flying the [[Farman MF.11|Farman MF.11 Shorthorn]] aircraft. He was then posted to No.25 Flying Training School at [[Thetford]] in Norfolk, closer to where his wife Maude and son Jack were living.<ref name=cpabac>{{cite web | title = The Coley Park Aerodrome and CWS Jam Works | url = http://www.users.on.net/~kevros/coleypark/oc_aerocws.htm | publisher = Coley Park & Beyond (Kevin Rosier)|website=Users.on.net | accessdate =15 February 2008}}</ref>\n \nOn 1 April 1918, Johns was appointed flying instructor at [[Marske-by-the-Sea]] in [[Yorkshire]]. The aircraft of the time were very unreliable and he wrote off three planes in three days through engine failure \u2013 crashing into the sea, then the sand, and then through a fellow officer's back door. Later, he was caught in fog over the [[Tees]], missed [[Hartlepool]] and narrowly escaped flying into a cliff. Shooting one's own propeller off with a forward-mounted machine-gun with malfunctioning [[synchronization gear|synchronisation]] was a fairly common accident, and it happened to Johns twice. The Commanding Officer at Marske was a Major Champion,{{who|date=December 2018}} known as 'Gimlet', a name used later by Johns for the hero of a series of stories. During this time Johns's probationary commission was confirmed<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=30887 |date=6 September 1918 |page=10551}}</ref> and he served as a flying instructor until August 1918 when he transferred to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].\n\nHe performed six weeks of active duty as a bomber pilot with [[No. 55 Squadron RAF]], close to the average in the latter part of the war.<ref>H.A.Jones. ''War in the Air''. Naval and Military Press; New edition (8 Oct 2002)</ref> This squadron was part of the [[Independent Air Force]], a section of the Royal Air Force that had been formed for the purpose of bombing strategic targets deep inside Germany.\n\nOn 16 September 1918 he was piloting one of six [[De Havilland DH4]]s on their way to bomb [[Mannheim]] when his aircraft was hit by anti-aircraft fire and he was forced to drop out of formation. He jettisoned his single {{convert|250|lb|kg|adj=on}} bomb and turned for home, but was attacked by a number of [[Fokker D.VII]] fighters. During a lengthy but one-sided battle, Johns' observer and rear-gunner, Second Lieutenant Alfred Edward Amey, was badly wounded and the aircraft shot down. The victory was credited to [[Georg Weiner]], the commander of [[Jagdstaffel 3]].<ref name=\"Hart\" /> Johns and Amey were taken prisoner by German troops: Johns received a leg wound during the battle and was slightly injured in the crash, but Amey died of his injuries later that day.<ref name=\"Hart\">{{cite book | title=Aces Falling: War Above The Trenches, 1918 | publisher=W&N | author=Hart, Peter | year=2007 | page=278 | isbn=0297846531}}</ref><ref name=\"auction\">{{cite web | url=http://www.invaluable.com/auction-lot/medals-royal-flying-corps-biggles-observer-s-casu-1-c-h46sfkylnv | title=Bosleys 2005, Lot 556 | website=Invaluable.com | accessdate=16 October 2012}}</ref> <ref group=\"Note\">Amey's medals were sold at auction in the United Kingdom in 2005, in a lot that included a letter to his family from Johns, describing the circumstances of his death ''(see: Bosleys 2005, Lot 556)''.

In his 46-year writing career (1922\u201368) he penned over 160 books, including nearly one hundred Biggles books, more than sixty other novels and factual books, and scores of magazine articles and short stories.\n\nHis first novel, ''Mossyface'',<ref group=\"Note\">Mossy Face was a name given by the Allies to [[Havrincourt|Havrincourt Wood]]: it is mentioned in some of the ''Biggles'' stories and in some pilot's memoirs of the period.</ref> was published in 1922 under the pen name \"William Earle\". After leaving the RAF, Johns became a newspaper air correspondent, as well as editing and illustrating books about flying. At the request of John Hamilton Ltd, he created the magazine ''Popular Flying'' which first appeared in March 1932. It was in the pages of ''Popular Flying'' that Biggles first appeared.\n\nThe first Biggles book, ''The Camels are Coming'' (a reference to the [[Sopwith Camel]] aeroplane), was published in August 1932 and Johns would continue to write Biggles stories until his death in 1968.
