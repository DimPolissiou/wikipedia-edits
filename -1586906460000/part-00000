Retrieved 27 August 2012, from http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/249989/Guy</ref> was the supreme ruler of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], the [[Crusader state]] founded by Christian princes in 1099 when the [[First Crusade]] took the city.\n\n[[Godfrey of Bouillon]], the first ruler of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, himself refused the title of king, and instead chose the title \"Defender of the [[Holy Sepulchre]]\". Thus, the title of king was only introduced for his successor, King [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin I]] in 1100. The city of Jerusalem was [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|lost in 1187]], but the Kingdom of Jerusalem survived, moving its capital to [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] in 1191. The city of Jerusalem was  re-captured in the [[Sixth Crusade]], during 1229\u201339 and 1241\u201344. \nThe Kingdom of Jerusalem was finally dissolved with the  [[Siege of Acre (1291)|fall of Acre]] and the end of the Crusades in the Holy Land in 1291.\n\nAfter the Crusader States ceased to exist, the title of ''King of Jerusalem'' was claimed by a number of European noble houses  descended from  the [[kings of Cyprus]] or the [[kings of Naples]]. The (purely ceremonial) title of ''King of Jerusalem'' is currently used by [[List of titles and honours of Felipe VI of Spain|Felipe VI of Spain]]. It was claimed by [[Otto von Habsburg]] as Habsburg pretender, and by the [[King of Italy|kings of Italy]] until 1946.\n\n==Kings of Jerusalem (1099\u20131291)==\nThe [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] had its origins in the [[First Crusade]], when [[Godfrey of Bouillon]], after refusing a crown and the title of King \"upon the plea that he would never wear a crown of gold where his [[Jesus Christ|Saviour]] had worn a [[crown of thorns]]\",<ref name=Porter01a>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jSJaAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA18 \n|title=A History of the Knights of Malta|series=[https://www.google.ie/search?tbo=p&tbm=bks&q=bibliogroup:%22Cambridge+Library+Collection+-+European+History%22&source=gbs_metadata_r&cad=7 Cambridge Library Collection - European History]|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|author=[[Whitworth Porter]]|page=18\n| date=2013|isbn=9781108066228|accessdate=20 May 2014|quote=Refusing the title of King and the diadem which were offered him, upon the plea that he would never wear a crown of gold where his Saviour had worn a crown of thorns, he modestly contented him with the title of Defender and Advocate of the Holy Sepulchre.}}</ref> took the title ''Advocatus Sancti Sepulchri'' (Protector of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre|Holy Sepulcher]]) in 1099 and was inaugurated as ruler of Jerusalem in the [[Church of the Nativity]] in [[Bethlehem]].\n\nThe following year, Godfrey died. His brother [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin I]] was the first to use the title [[Monarch|king]] and the first to be crowned king in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in [[Jerusalem]] itself.\n\nThe kingship of Jerusalem was partially [[Elected monarchy| elected]] and partially hereditary. During the height of the kingdom in the mid-12th century there was a royal family and a relatively clear line of succession. Nevertheless, the king was elected, or at least recognized, by the [[Haute Cour of Jerusalem|Haute Cour]]. Here the king was considered a [[primus inter pares]] (first among equals), and in his absence his duties were performed by his [[officers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem|seneschal]].\n\nThe purpose-built royal palace used from the 1160s onwards was located south of Jerusalem's [[Tower of David|citadel]].<ref name=\"BoasJlm\">Adrian J.

The king personally held several [[fief]]s incorporated into the royal [[Demesne|domain]], that varied from king to king. He was also responsible for leading the kingdom into battle, although this duty could be passed to a constable.\n\nWhile several contemporary European states were moving towards centralized monarchies, the king of Jerusalem was continually losing power to the strongest of his barons. This was partially due to the young age of many of the kings, and the frequency of regents from the ranks of the nobles.\n\nAfter the fall of Jerusalem in 1187, the capital of the kingdom was moved to [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], where it remained until 1291, although coronations took place in [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]].\n\nIn this period the kingship was often simply a nominal position, held by a European ruler who never actually lived in Acre. When young [[Conradin|Conrad III]] was king and living in Southern Germany, his father's second cousin, [[Hugh of Brienne]], claimed the regency of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] and, indirectly, his place in the succession. The claim was made in 1264 as senior descendant and rightful heir of [[Alice of Champagne]], second daughter of Queen Isabella I, Hugh being the son of their eldest daughter. But was passed over by the Haute Cour in favour of his cousin, [[Hugh of Antioch]], the future Hugh III of Cyprus and Hugh I of Jerusalem.\n\nAfter Conrad III's execution by [[Charles I of Sicily]] in 1268, the kingship was held by the [[Lusignan dynasty|Lusignan]] family, who were simultaneously [[Kingdom of Cyprus|kings of Cyprus]]. However, Charles I of Sicily purchased the rights of one of the heirs of the kingdom in 1277.\n\nIn that year, he sent [[Roger of Sanseverino]] to the East as his [[bailiff]]. Roger captured Acre and obtained a forced homage from the barons. Roger was recalled in 1282 due to the [[Sicilian Vespers]] and left [[Odo Poilechien]] in his place to rule.  His resources and authority was minimal, and he was ejected by [[Henry II of Cyprus]] when he arrived from Cyprus for his coronation as King of Jerusalem.\n\nAcre was captured by the [[Mamluks]] in 1291, eliminating the crusader presence on the mainland.\n\n===Kings===\n\n===House of Boulogne (1099\u20131118)===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Baldwin II had no male heirs but had already designated his daughter [[Melisende of Jerusalem|Melisende]] to succeed him. Baldwin II wanted to safeguard his daughter's inheritance by marrying her to a powerful lord. Fulk was a wealthy crusader and experienced military commander, and a widower. His experience in the field would prove invaluable in a frontier state always in the grip of war.\n\nHowever, Fulk held out for better terms than mere consort of the Queen; he wanted to be king alongside Melisende. Baldwin II, reflecting on Fulk's fortune and military exploits, acquiesced. Fulk then resigned his titles to his son [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou|Geoffrey]] and sailed to become King of Jerusalem, where he married [[Melisende of Jerusalem|Melisende]] on 2 June 1129. Later Baldwin II bolstered Melisende's position in the kingdom by making her sole guardian of her son by Fulk, [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem|Baldwin III]], born in 1130.\n\nFulk and Melisende became joint rulers of Jerusalem in 1131 with Baldwin II's death. From the start Fulk assumed sole control of the government, excluding Melisende altogether. He favored fellow countrymen from Anjou to the native nobility. The other crusader states to the north feared that Fulk would attempt to impose the suzerainty of Jerusalem over them, as Baldwin II had done; but as Fulk was far less powerful than his deceased father-in-law, the northern states rejected his authority.\n\n[[File:FoulquesofAnjou-death.jpg|left|thumb|150px|The death of Fulk, as depicted in MS of William of Tyre's ''Historia'' and ''Old French Continuation'', painted in Acre, 13C. ''Bib. Nat. Fran\u00e7aise''.]]\n\nIn Jerusalem as well, Fulk was resented by the second generation of Jerusalem Christians who had grown up there since the First Crusade. These \"natives\" focused on Melisende's cousin, the popular [[Hugh II of Le Puiset]], [[count of Jaffa]], who was devotedly loyal to the Queen. Fulk saw Hugh as a rival, and in 1134, in order to expose Hugh, accused him of infidelity with Melisende. Hugh rebelled in protest and secured himself to Jaffa, allying himself with the Muslims of [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]]. He was able to defeat the army set against him by Fulk, but this situation could not hold. The [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch]] interceded in the conflict, perhaps at the behest of Melisende. Fulk agreed to peace and Hugh was exiled from the kingdom for three years, a lenient sentence.\n\nHowever, an assassination attempt was made against Hugh. Fulk, or his supporters, were commonly believed responsible, though direct proof never surfaced. The scandal was all that was needed for the queen's party to take over the government in what amounted to a palace coup. Author and historian Bernard Hamilton wrote that the Fulk's supporters \"went in terror of their lives\" in the palace. Contemporary author and historian [[William of Tyre]] wrote of Fulk \"he never attempted to take the initiative, even in trivial matters, without (Melisende's) consent\". The result was that Melisende held direct and unquestioned control over the government from 1136 onwards. Sometime before 1136 Fulk reconciled with his wife, and a second son, [[Amalric I of Jerusalem|Amalric]] was born.\n\nIn 1143, while the king and queen were on holiday in [[Akko|Acre]], Fulk was killed in a hunting accident. His horse stumbled, fell, and Fulk's skull was crushed by the saddle, \"and his brains gushed forth from both ears and nostrils\", as William of Tyre describes. He was carried back to Acre, where he lay unconscious for three days before he died. He was buried in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in Jerusalem. Though their marriage started in conflict, Melisende mourned for him privately as well as publicly. Fulk was survived by his son Geoffrey of Anjou by his first wife, and Baldwin III and Amalric I by Melisende.\n\n[[Baldwin III of Jerusalem|Baldwin III]] ascended the throne with his mother as co-ruler, in 1143. His early reign was laced with squabbles with his mother over the possession of Jerusalem, till 1153, when he took personal hold of the government. He died in 1163, without heirs, and the kingdom passed to his brother, [[Amalric I of Jerusalem|Amalric I]], although there was some opposition among the nobility to Amalric's wife Agnes; they were willing to accept the marriage in 1157 when Baldwin III was still capable of siring an heir, but now the ''[[Haute Cour of Jerusalem|Haute Cour]]'' refused to endorse Amalric as king unless his marriage to Agnes was annulled. The hostility to Agnes, it must be admitted, may be exaggerated by the chronicler William of Tyre, whom she prevented from becoming [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem]] decades later, as well as from William's continuators like [[Ernoul]], who hints at a slight on her moral character: \"car telle n'est que roine doie iestre di si haute cite comme de Jherusalem\" (\"there should not be such a queen for so holy a city as Jerusalem\").\n\nNevertheless, [[consanguinity]] was enough for the opposition. Amalric agreed and ascended the throne without a wife, although Agnes continued to hold the title Countess of Jaffa and Ascalon and received a pension from that fief's income. The church ruled that Amalric and Agnes' children were legitimate and preserved their place in the order of succession. Through her children Agnes would exert much influence in Jerusalem for almost 20 years. Almaric was succeeded by his son by Agnes, [[Baldwin IV of Jerusalem|Baldwin IV]].\n\n[[File:Maria Comnena and Amalric I of Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The marriage of Amalric I of Jerusalem and Maria Comnena at [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]]]]\n\nAlmaric's wives, [[Agnes of Courtenay]], now married to [[Reginald of Sidon]], and [[Maria Comnena, Queen consort of Jerusalem|Maria Comnena]], the dowager Queen, who had married [[Balian of Ibelin]] in 1177. His daughter by Agnes, Sibylla, was already of age, the mother of a son, and was clearly in a strong position to succeed her brother, but Maria's daughter [[Isabella of Jerusalem|Isabella]] had the support of her stepfather's family, the [[House of Ibelin|Ibelins]].\n\nIn 1179, Baldwin began planning to marry Sibylla to [[Hugh III of Burgundy]], but by spring 1180 this was still unresolved. [[Raymond III of Tripoli]] attempted a coup, and began to march on Jerusalem with Bohemund III, to force the king to marry his sister to a local candidate of his own choosing, probably [[Baldwin of Ibelin]], Balian's older brother. To counter this, the king hastily arranged her marriage to [[Guy of Lusignan]], younger brother of [[Amalric II of Jerusalem|Amalric]], the [[Officers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem#Constables|constable]] of the kingdom. A foreign match was essential to bring the possibility of external military aid to the kingdom. With the new French king [[Philip II of France|Philip II]] a minor, Guy's status as a vassal of the King and Sibylla's first cousin [[Henry II of England]] \u2013 who owed the Pope a penitential pilgrimage \u2013 was useful.\n\n[[File:BaldwinIV.jpg|thumb|right|200px|William of Tyre discovers Baldwin's first symptoms of leprosy (MS of''[[Estoire d'Eracles]]'' (French translation of William of Tyre's ''Historia''), painted in France, 1250s.''[[British Library]], London''.)]]\n\nBy 1182, Baldwin IV, increasingly incapacitated by his leprosy, named Guy as ''bailli''. Raymond contested this, but when Guy fell out of favour with Baldwin the following year, he was re-appointed ''bailli'' and was given possession of [[Beirut]]. Baldwin came to an agreement with Raymond and the [[Haute Cour of Jerusalem|Haute Cour]] to make Baldwin of Montferrat, Sibylla's son by her first marriage, his heir, before Sibylla and Guy. The child was crowned co-king as Baldwin V in 1183 in a ceremony presided by Raymond. It was agreed that, should the boy die during his minority, the regency would pass to \"the most rightful heirs\" until his kinsmen \u2013 the Kings of England and France and [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor]] \u2013 and the [[Pope]] were able to adjudicate between the claims of Sibylla and Isabella. These \"most rightful heirs\" were not named.\n\nBaldwin IV died in spring 1185, and was succeeded by his nephew. Raymond was ''bailli'', but he had passed Baldwin V's personal guardianship to Joscelin III of Edessa, his maternal great-uncle, claiming that he did not wish to attract suspicion if the child, who does not seem to have been robust, were to die. Baldwin V died during the summer of 1186, at [[Akka, Palestine|Acre]]. Neither side paid any heed to Baldwin IV's will.\n\nAfter the funeral, Joscelin had Sibylla named as her brother's successor, although she had to agree to divorce Guy, just as her father had divorced her mother, with the guarantee that she would be allowed to choose a new consort. Once crowned, she immediately crowned Guy. Meanwhile, Raymond had gone to [[Nablus]], home of Balian and Maria, and summoned all those nobles loyal to Princess Isabella and the Ibelins. Raymond wanted instead to have her and her husband [[Humphrey IV of Toron]] crowned. However, Humphrey, whose stepfather [[Raynald of Ch\u00e2tillon]] was an ally of Guy, deserted him and swore allegiance to Guy and Sibylla.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Monarch\n! Image\n!

None of these claimants, however, has actually ruled over any part of the kingdom:\n* Count [[Hugh of Brienne]] claimed the regency of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], and indirectly, his place in the succession in 1264 as senior heir of [[Alice of Champagne|Alice of Jerusalem]], second daughter of Queen Isabella I, and [[Hugh I of Cyprus]].  Hugh, although the son of their eldest daughter, was passed over by the [[Haute Cour of Jerusalem|Haute Cour]] in favour of his cousin [[Hugh of Antioch]], the future Hugh III of Cyprus and Hugh I of Jerusalem.  The Brienne claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem continued, but the family had afterwards next to no part in affairs in Outremer.\n* After the end of the kingdom, Henry II of Cyprus continued to use the title of King of Jerusalem.  After his death the title was claimed by his successors, the [[Kingdom of Cyprus|kings of Cyprus]].\n* The title was also continuously used by the Angevin [[Kingdom of Naples|kings of Naples]], whose founder, Charles of Anjou, had in 1277 bought a claim to the throne from [[Mary of Antioch]].  Thereafter, this claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem was treated as a tributary of the crown of Naples, which often changed hands by testament or conquest rather than direct inheritance.  As Naples was a papal fief, the Popes often endorsed the title of King of Jerusalem as well as of Naples, and the history of these claims is that of the Neapolitan Kingdom.\n* The [[House of Lorraine]] inherited the claim from the Angevin kings through [[Ren\u00e9 II, Duke of Lorraine|Rene II]], son of [[Louis II of Naples]] and pretender to the Neapolitan throne. After the merger of the House of Lorraine with the [[Habsburgs]] with the marriage of [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I Stephen]] to [[Maria Theresa|Maria Theresa of Austria]], the claim was inherited by the Habsburgs and remained  among the titles of the [[Emperors of Austria]] until 1918.\n\n===Potential claimants today===\nThere are several potential claimants of the title today:\n*The title is used by the [[List of titles and honours of the Spanish Crown|Spanish Crown]], currently held by [[Felipe VI of Spain]],\n*[[Karl von Habsburg]], current head of the [[House of Habsburg-Lorraine]]; Karl's late father [[Otto von Habsburg]] renounced all pretense to the Habsburg titles in 1958.\n*[[Victor Emmanuel, Prince of Naples]], pretender to the royal throne of Italy (House of Savoy){{cn|date=September 2016}}\n*[[Amedeo, 5th Duke of Aosta]], pretender to the royal throne of Italy (House of Savoy-Aosta){{cn|date=September 2016}}\n*[[Prince Pedro, Duke of Noto|Prince Pedro, Duke of Calabria]], pretender to the royal throne of Two Sicilies (House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies Calabria line){{cn|date=September 2016}}\n*[[Prince Carlo, Duke of Castro]], pretender to the royal throne of Two Sicilies (House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies Castro line){{cn|date=September 2016}}\n*[[Charles-Antoine Lamoral, prince de Ligne de La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle]], heir-general of Yolande-Louise of Savoy and the Brienne claims{{cn|date=September 2016}}\n\n===Lines of succession in several claims===\n{{or-section|date=October 2019}}\nItalics indicate individuals who did not themselves use the title of king of Jerusalem.\n\n==== Cypriot claimants ====<!-- This section is linked from [[Kingdom of Cyprus]] -->\n'''[[Lusignan dynasty|House of Lusignan]]'''\n*[[Henry II of Jerusalem|Henry II]] (1285) 1291\u20131324\n*[[Hugh IV of Cyprus|Hugh]] 1324\u20131359\n*[[Peter I of Cyprus|Peter I]] 1359\u20131369\n*[[Peter II of Cyprus|Peter II]] 1369\u20131382\n*[[James I of Cyprus|James I]] 1382\u20131398\n*[[Janus of Cyprus|Janus]] 1398\u20131432\n*[[John II of Cyprus|John]] 1432\u20131458\n*[[Charlotte of Cyprus|Charlotte I]] 1458\u20131485 (d. 1487) m. 1459 her cousin [[Louis of Savoy, Count of Geneva|Louis of Savoy]] (d. 1482).

Thus, the title of king was only introduced for his successor, King [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin I]] in 1100. The city of Jerusalem was [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|lost in 1187]], but the Kingdom of Jerusalem survived, moving its capital to [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] in 1191. The city of Jerusalem was  re-captured in the [[Sixth Crusade]], during 1229\u201339 and 1241\u201344. \nThe Kingdom of Jerusalem was finally dissolved with the  [[Siege of Acre (1291)|fall of Acre]] and the end of the Crusades in the Holy Land in 1291.\n\nAfter the Crusader States ceased to exist, the title of ''King of Jerusalem'' was claimed by a number of European noble houses  descended from  the [[kings of Cyprus]] or the [[kings of Naples]]. The (purely ceremonial) title of ''King of Jerusalem'' is currently used by [[List of titles and honours of Felipe VI of Spain|Felipe VI of Spain]]. It was claimed by [[Otto von Habsburg]] as Habsburg pretender, and by the [[King of Italy|kings of Italy]] until 1946.\n\n==Kings of Jerusalem (1099\u20131291)==\nThe [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] had its origins in the [[First Crusade]], when [[Godfrey of Bouillon]], after refusing a crown and the title of King \"upon the plea that he would never wear a crown of gold where his [[Jesus Christ|Saviour]] had worn a [[crown of thorns]]\",<ref name=Porter01a>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jSJaAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA18 \n|title=A History of the Knights of Malta|series=[https://www.google.ie/search?tbo=p&tbm=bks&q=bibliogroup:%22Cambridge+Library+Collection+-+European+History%22&source=gbs_metadata_r&cad=7 Cambridge Library Collection - European History]|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|author=[[Whitworth Porter]]|page=18\n| date=2013|isbn=9781108066228|accessdate=20 May 2014|quote=Refusing the title of King and the diadem which were offered him, upon the plea that he would never wear a crown of gold where his Saviour had worn a crown of thorns, he modestly contented him with the title of Defender and Advocate of the Holy Sepulchre.}}</ref> took the title ''Advocatus Sancti Sepulchri'' (Protector of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre|Holy Sepulcher]]) in 1099 and was inaugurated as ruler of Jerusalem in the [[Church of the Nativity]] in [[Bethlehem]].\n\nThe following year, Godfrey died. His brother [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin I]] was the first to use the title [[Monarch|king]] and the first to be crowned king in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in [[Jerusalem]] itself.\n\nThe kingship of Jerusalem was partially [[Elected monarchy| elected]] and partially hereditary. During the height of the kingdom in the mid-12th century there was a royal family and a relatively clear line of succession. Nevertheless, the king was elected, or at least recognized, by the [[Haute Cour of Jerusalem|Haute Cour]]. Here the king was considered a [[primus inter pares]] (first among equals), and in his absence his duties were performed by his [[officers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem|seneschal]].\n\nThe purpose-built royal palace used from the 1160s onwards was located south of Jerusalem's [[Tower of David|citadel]].<ref name=\"BoasJlm\">Adrian J.

The king personally held several [[fief]]s incorporated into the royal [[Demesne|domain]], that varied from king to king. He was also responsible for leading the kingdom into battle, although this duty could be passed to a constable.\n\nWhile several contemporary European states were moving towards centralized monarchies, the king of Jerusalem was continually losing power to the strongest of his barons. This was partially due to the young age of many of the kings, and the frequency of regents from the ranks of the nobles.\n\nAfter the fall of Jerusalem in 1187, the capital of the kingdom was moved to [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], where it remained until 1291, although coronations took place in [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]].\n\nIn this period the kingship was often simply a nominal position, held by a European ruler who never actually lived in Acre. When young [[Conradin|Conrad III]] was king and living in Southern Germany, his father's second cousin, [[Hugh of Brienne]], claimed the regency of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] and, indirectly, his place in the succession. The claim was made in 1264 as senior descendant and rightful heir of [[Alice of Champagne]], second daughter of Queen Isabella I, Hugh being the son of their eldest daughter. But was passed over by the Haute Cour in favour of his cousin, [[Hugh of Antioch]], the future Hugh III of Cyprus and Hugh I of Jerusalem.\n\nAfter Conrad III's execution by [[Charles I of Sicily]] in 1268, the kingship was held by the [[Lusignan dynasty|Lusignan]] family, who were simultaneously [[Kingdom of Cyprus|kings of Cyprus]]. However, Charles I of Sicily purchased the rights of one of the heirs of the kingdom in 1277.\n\nIn that year, he sent [[Roger of Sanseverino]] to the East as his [[bailiff]]. Roger captured Acre and obtained a forced homage from the barons. Roger was recalled in 1282 due to the [[Sicilian Vespers]] and left [[Odo Poilechien]] in his place to rule.  His resources and authority was minimal, and he was ejected by [[Henry II of Cyprus]] when he arrived from Cyprus for his coronation as King of Jerusalem.\n\nAcre was captured by the [[Mamluks]] in 1291, eliminating the crusader presence on the mainland.\n\n===Kings===\n\n===House of Boulogne (1099\u20131118)===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Baldwin II had no male heirs but had already designated his daughter [[Melisende of Jerusalem|Melisende]] to succeed him. Baldwin II wanted to safeguard his daughter's inheritance by marrying her to a powerful lord. Fulk was a wealthy crusader and experienced military commander, and a widower. His experience in the field would prove invaluable in a frontier state always in the grip of war.\n\nHowever, Fulk held out for better terms than mere consort of the Queen; he wanted to be king alongside Melisende. Baldwin II, reflecting on Fulk's fortune and military exploits, acquiesced. Fulk then resigned his titles to his son [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou|Geoffrey]] and sailed to become King of Jerusalem, where he married [[Melisende of Jerusalem|Melisende]] on 2 June 1129. Later Baldwin II bolstered Melisende's position in the kingdom by making her sole guardian of her son by Fulk, [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem|Baldwin III]], born in 1130.\n\nFulk and Melisende became joint rulers of Jerusalem in 1131 with Baldwin II's death. From the start Fulk assumed sole control of the government, excluding Melisende altogether. He favored fellow countrymen from Anjou to the native nobility. The other crusader states to the north feared that Fulk would attempt to impose the suzerainty of Jerusalem over them, as Baldwin II had done; but as Fulk was far less powerful than his deceased father-in-law, the northern states rejected his authority.\n\n[[File:FoulquesofAnjou-death.jpg|left|thumb|150px|The death of Fulk, as depicted in MS of William of Tyre's ''Historia'' and ''Old French Continuation'', painted in Acre, 13C. ''Bib. Nat. Fran\u00e7aise''.]]\n\nIn Jerusalem as well, Fulk was resented by the second generation of Jerusalem Christians who had grown up there since the First Crusade. These \"natives\" focused on Melisende's cousin, the popular [[Hugh II of Le Puiset]], [[count of Jaffa]], who was devotedly loyal to the Queen. Fulk saw Hugh as a rival, and in 1134, in order to expose Hugh, accused him of infidelity with Melisende. Hugh rebelled in protest and secured himself to Jaffa, allying himself with the Muslims of [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]]. He was able to defeat the army set against him by Fulk, but this situation could not hold. The [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch]] interceded in the conflict, perhaps at the behest of Melisende. Fulk agreed to peace and Hugh was exiled from the kingdom for three years, a lenient sentence.\n\nHowever, an assassination attempt was made against Hugh. Fulk, or his supporters, were commonly believed responsible, though direct proof never surfaced. The scandal was all that was needed for the queen's party to take over the government in what amounted to a palace coup. Author and historian Bernard Hamilton wrote that the Fulk's supporters \"went in terror of their lives\" in the palace. Contemporary author and historian [[William of Tyre]] wrote of Fulk \"he never attempted to take the initiative, even in trivial matters, without (Melisende's) consent\". The result was that Melisende held direct and unquestioned control over the government from 1136 onwards. Sometime before 1136 Fulk reconciled with his wife, and a second son, [[Amalric I of Jerusalem|Amalric]] was born.\n\nIn 1143, while the king and queen were on holiday in [[Akko|Acre]], Fulk was killed in a hunting accident. His horse stumbled, fell, and Fulk's skull was crushed by the saddle, \"and his brains gushed forth from both ears and nostrils\", as William of Tyre describes. He was carried back to Acre, where he lay unconscious for three days before he died. He was buried in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in Jerusalem. Though their marriage started in conflict, Melisende mourned for him privately as well as publicly. Fulk was survived by his son Geoffrey of Anjou by his first wife, and Baldwin III and Amalric I by Melisende.\n\n[[Baldwin III of Jerusalem|Baldwin III]] ascended the throne with his mother as co-ruler, in 1143. His early reign was laced with squabbles with his mother over the possession of Jerusalem, till 1153, when he took personal hold of the government. He died in 1163, without heirs, and the kingdom passed to his brother, [[Amalric I of Jerusalem|Amalric I]], although there was some opposition among the nobility to Amalric's wife Agnes; they were willing to accept the marriage in 1157 when Baldwin III was still capable of siring an heir, but now the ''[[Haute Cour of Jerusalem|Haute Cour]]'' refused to endorse Amalric as king unless his marriage to Agnes was annulled. The hostility to Agnes, it must be admitted, may be exaggerated by the chronicler William of Tyre, whom she prevented from becoming [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem]] decades later, as well as from William's continuators like [[Ernoul]], who hints at a slight on her moral character: \"car telle n'est que roine doie iestre di si haute cite comme de Jherusalem\" (\"there should not be such a queen for so holy a city as Jerusalem\").\n\nNevertheless, [[consanguinity]] was enough for the opposition. Amalric agreed and ascended the throne without a wife, although Agnes continued to hold the title Countess of Jaffa and Ascalon and received a pension from that fief's income. The church ruled that Amalric and Agnes' children were legitimate and preserved their place in the order of succession. Through her children Agnes would exert much influence in Jerusalem for almost 20 years. Almaric was succeeded by his son by Agnes, [[Baldwin IV of Jerusalem|Baldwin IV]].\n\n[[File:Maria Comnena and Amalric I of Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The marriage of Amalric I of Jerusalem and Maria Comnena at [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]]]]\n\nAlmaric's wives, [[Agnes of Courtenay]], now married to [[Reginald of Sidon]], and [[Maria Comnena, Queen consort of Jerusalem|Maria Comnena]], the dowager Queen, who had married [[Balian of Ibelin]] in 1177. His daughter by Agnes, Sibylla, was already of age, the mother of a son, and was clearly in a strong position to succeed her brother, but Maria's daughter [[Isabella of Jerusalem|Isabella]] had the support of her stepfather's family, the [[House of Ibelin|Ibelins]].\n\nIn 1179, Baldwin began planning to marry Sibylla to [[Hugh III of Burgundy]], but by spring 1180 this was still unresolved. [[Raymond III of Tripoli]] attempted a coup, and began to march on Jerusalem with Bohemund III, to force the king to marry his sister to a local candidate of his own choosing, probably [[Baldwin of Ibelin]], Balian's older brother. To counter this, the king hastily arranged her marriage to [[Guy of Lusignan]], younger brother of [[Amalric II of Jerusalem|Amalric]], the [[Officers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem#Constables|constable]] of the kingdom. A foreign match was essential to bring the possibility of external military aid to the kingdom. With the new French king [[Philip II of France|Philip II]] a minor, Guy's status as a vassal of the King and Sibylla's first cousin [[Henry II of England]] \u2013 who owed the Pope a penitential pilgrimage \u2013 was useful.\n\n[[File:BaldwinIV.jpg|thumb|right|200px|William of Tyre discovers Baldwin's first symptoms of leprosy (MS of''[[Estoire d'Eracles]]'' (French translation of William of Tyre's ''Historia''), painted in France, 1250s.''[[British Library]], London''.)]]\n\nBy 1182, Baldwin IV, increasingly incapacitated by his leprosy, named Guy as ''bailli''. Raymond contested this, but when Guy fell out of favour with Baldwin the following year, he was re-appointed ''bailli'' and was given possession of [[Beirut]]. Baldwin came to an agreement with Raymond and the [[Haute Cour of Jerusalem|Haute Cour]] to make Baldwin of Montferrat, Sibylla's son by her first marriage, his heir, before Sibylla and Guy. The child was crowned co-king as Baldwin V in 1183 in a ceremony presided by Raymond. It was agreed that, should the boy die during his minority, the regency would pass to \"the most rightful heirs\" until his kinsmen \u2013 the Kings of England and France and [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor]] \u2013 and the [[Pope]] were able to adjudicate between the claims of Sibylla and Isabella. These \"most rightful heirs\" were not named.\n\nBaldwin IV died in spring 1185, and was succeeded by his nephew. Raymond was ''bailli'', but he had passed Baldwin V's personal guardianship to Joscelin III of Edessa, his maternal great-uncle, claiming that he did not wish to attract suspicion if the child, who does not seem to have been robust, were to die. Baldwin V died during the summer of 1186, at [[Akka, Palestine|Acre]]. Neither side paid any heed to Baldwin IV's will.\n\nAfter the funeral, Joscelin had Sibylla named as her brother's successor, although she had to agree to divorce Guy, just as her father had divorced her mother, with the guarantee that she would be allowed to choose a new consort. Once crowned, she immediately crowned Guy. Meanwhile, Raymond had gone to [[Nablus]], home of Balian and Maria, and summoned all those nobles loyal to Princess Isabella and the Ibelins. Raymond wanted instead to have her and her husband [[Humphrey IV of Toron]] crowned. However, Humphrey, whose stepfather [[Raynald of Ch\u00e2tillon]] was an ally of Guy, deserted him and swore allegiance to Guy and Sibylla.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Monarch\n! Image\n!

None of these claimants, however, has actually ruled over any part of the kingdom:\n* Count [[Hugh of Brienne]] claimed the regency of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], and indirectly, his place in the succession in 1264 as senior heir of [[Alice of Champagne|Alice of Jerusalem]], second daughter of Queen Isabella I, and [[Hugh I of Cyprus]].  Hugh, although the son of their eldest daughter, was passed over by the [[Haute Cour of Jerusalem|Haute Cour]] in favour of his cousin [[Hugh of Antioch]], the future Hugh III of Cyprus and Hugh I of Jerusalem.  The Brienne claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem continued, but the family had afterwards next to no part in affairs in Outremer.\n* After the end of the kingdom, Henry II of Cyprus continued to use the title of King of Jerusalem.  After his death the title was claimed by his successors, the [[Kingdom of Cyprus|kings of Cyprus]].\n* The title was also continuously used by the Angevin [[Kingdom of Naples|kings of Naples]], whose founder, Charles of Anjou, had in 1277 bought a claim to the throne from [[Mary of Antioch]].  Thereafter, this claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem was treated as a tributary of the crown of Naples, which often changed hands by testament or conquest rather than direct inheritance.  As Naples was a papal fief, the Popes often endorsed the title of King of Jerusalem as well as of Naples, and the history of these claims is that of the Neapolitan Kingdom.\n* The [[House of Lorraine]] inherited the claim from the Angevin kings through [[Ren\u00e9 II, Duke of Lorraine|Rene II]], son of [[Louis II of Naples]] and pretender to the Neapolitan throne. After the merger of the House of Lorraine with the [[Habsburgs]] with the marriage of [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I Stephen]] to [[Maria Theresa|Maria Theresa of Austria]], the claim was inherited by the Habsburgs and remained  among the titles of the [[Emperors of Austria]] until 1918.\n\n===Potential claimants today===\nThere are several potential claimants of the title today:\n*The title is used by the [[List of titles and honours of the Spanish Crown|Spanish Crown]], currently held by [[Felipe VI of Spain]],\n*[[Karl von Habsburg]], current head of the [[House of Habsburg-Lorraine]]; Karl's late father [[Otto von Habsburg]] renounced all pretense to the Habsburg titles in 1958.\n*[[Victor Emmanuel, Prince of Naples]], pretender to the royal throne of Italy (House of Savoy){{cn|date=September 2016}}\n*[[Amedeo, 5th Duke of Aosta]], pretender to the royal throne of Italy (House of Savoy-Aosta){{cn|date=September 2016}}\n*[[Prince Pedro, Duke of Noto|Prince Pedro, Duke of Calabria]], pretender to the royal throne of Two Sicilies (House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies Calabria line){{cn|date=September 2016}}\n*[[Prince Carlo, Duke of Castro]], pretender to the royal throne of Two Sicilies (House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies Castro line){{cn|date=September 2016}}\n*[[Charles-Antoine Lamoral, prince de Ligne de La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle]], heir-general of Yolande-Louise of Savoy and the Brienne claims{{cn|date=September 2016}}\n\n===Lines of succession in several claims===\n{{or-section|date=October 2019}}\nItalics indicate individuals who did not themselves use the title of king of Jerusalem.\n\n==== Cypriot claimants ====<!-- This section is linked from [[Kingdom of Cyprus]] -->\n'''[[Lusignan dynasty|House of Lusignan]]'''\n*[[Henry II of Jerusalem|Henry II]] (1285) 1291\u20131324\n*[[Hugh IV of Cyprus|Hugh]] 1324\u20131359\n*[[Peter I of Cyprus|Peter I]] 1359\u20131369\n*[[Peter II of Cyprus|Peter II]] 1369\u20131382\n*[[James I of Cyprus|James I]] 1382\u20131398\n*[[Janus of Cyprus|Janus]] 1398\u20131432\n*[[John II of Cyprus|John]] 1432\u20131458\n*[[Charlotte of Cyprus|Charlotte I]] 1458\u20131485 (d. 1487) m. 1459 her cousin [[Louis of Savoy, Count of Geneva|Louis of Savoy]] (d. 1482).
