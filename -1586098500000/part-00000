It was named after George Washington Culver who was living in Ottawa County, Kansas in August 1868 when he was recruited to be a scout for Col. George Forsyth, following the first Spillman-Bacon Creek Indian raid. At daybreak on September 17, 1868 Forsyth's band of 50 civilian scouts was attacked by about 1,000 of Roman Nose's dog soldier warriors in northeastern Colorado Territory. This was known as Beecher Island. They took cover on a small sandy island in the middle of the Arickaree fork of the Republican river about 17 miles south of present-day Wray, Colorado. The next three days were spent fighting and by the time the fighting ended, the scouts were out of rations and living on horse and mule meat. About half of the scouts were wounded at the outbreak of the fighting. Culver was one of five scouts killed or mortally wounded.  Culver was buried at the battleground, later moved to Fort Wallace Cemetery and eventually to Fort Leavenworth National Cemetery. Before Beecher Island, during the Civil war he served as 2nd Lt, Co E, Second Colorado Cavalry. Following the Civil War, he worked for a time as a watchmaker in Junction City, Kansas, and shortly before his death was elected to public office in Ottawa County, Kansas. The town and township of Culver were named in honor of him.<ref>http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~lincolncounty/september2008.pdf</ref>\n\nA post office was opened at Culver in 1873 and remained in operation until it was discontinued in 1984.,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kshs.org/geog/geog_postoffices/search/county:OT |title=Kansas Post Offices, 1828-1961 |publisher=Kansas Historical Society |accessdate=22 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131009122953/http://www.kshs.org/geog/geog_postoffices/search/county%3AOT |archivedate=October 9, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nCulver is located at {{coord|38|58|10|N|97|45|35|W|type:city}} (38.969581, -97.759657).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|0.15|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, all of it land.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2012-07-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125061959/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=2012-01-25 }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|align=left\n|1910= 326\n|1920= 234\n|1930= 206\n|1940= 195\n|1950= 153\n|1960= 200\n|1970= 148\n|1980= 167\n|1990= 162\n|2000= 164\n|2010= 121\n|estyear=2016\n|estimate=118\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2016\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2016.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 9, 2017}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=[https://www.census.gov/prod/www/abs/decennial/ U.S. Decennial Census]\n}}\nCulver is part of the [[Salina, Kansas|Salina]] [[Salina micropolitan area|Micropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name =\"FactFinder\">{{cite web|title=American FactFinder|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212234628/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=2020-02-12|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-07-06}}</ref> of 2010, there were 121 people, 48 households, and 34 families residing in the city.

The estrogen level may fall after bleeding occurs during the menstrual cycle or when external sources of estrogen are no longer taken, like when a woman stops taking birth control pills or hormone pills in hormone replacement therapy.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nThe diagnosis of a menstrual migraine is made by keeping track of when the migraines occur for a period of at least three months. Menstrually related migraine attacks occur usually between 2 days before and 3 days after the start of menstruation in at least 2 out of 3 menstrual cycles (periods) in a row. Pure menstrual migraine and menstrually related migraine are both migraines without auras with one exceptionally rare case with aura reported in 2012.\n\nThe ''Menstrual Migraine Assessment Tool'' (MMAT) is a simple questionnaire with three questions, that has shown to be fairly accurate in diagnosing menstrual migraine (Tepper SJ, 2008).<ref>Stewart J. Tepper: The Cleveland Clinic Manual of Headache Therapy, Springer; 1st ed. 2011. pp. 15-16\n{{ISBN|146140178X}}</ref>  The three questions are:\n\n# Do migraines occur in the space of time 2 days before the beginning of a woman's period, until the third day after the start of the period. And does this happen in most months.\n# Do headaches that happen during this time become very severe.\n# Does the woman experience ''photophobia'' which is when a medical problem cause light to bother a person's eyes.\n\nThe answer to the first question has to be yes and there has to be at least one yes answer to either question 2 or question 3.<ref>{{Cite journal |pmid = 19076645|year = 2008|last1 = Tepper|first1 = S.

The estrogen level may fall after bleeding occurs during the menstrual cycle or when external sources of estrogen are no longer taken, like when a woman stops taking birth control pills or hormone pills in hormone replacement therapy.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nThe diagnosis of a menstrual migraine is made by keeping track of when the migraines occur for a period of at least three months. Menstrually related migraine attacks occur usually between 2 days before and 3 days after the start of menstruation in at least 2 out of 3 menstrual cycles (periods) in a row. Pure menstrual migraine and menstrually related migraine are both migraines without auras with one exceptionally rare case with aura reported in 2012.\n\nThe ''Menstrual Migraine Assessment Tool'' (MMAT) is a simple questionaire with three questions, that has shown to be fairly accurate in diagnosing menstrual migraine (Tepper SJ, 2008).<ref>Stewart J. Tepper: The Cleveland Clinic Manual of Headache Therapy, Springer; 1st ed. 2011. pp. 15-16\n{{ISBN|146140178X}}</ref>  The three questions are:\n\n# Do migraines occur in the space of time 2 days before the beginning of a woman's period, until the third day after the start of the period. And does this happen in most months.\n# Do headaches that happen during this time become very severe.\n# Does the woman experience ''photophobia'' which is when a medical problem cause light to bother a person's eyes.\n\nThe answer to the first question has to be yes and there has to be at least one yes answer to either question 2 or question 3.<ref>{{Cite journal |pmid = 19076645|year = 2008|last1 = Tepper|first1 = S.

Liu Yan had been previously defeated by D\u01b0\u01a1ng \u0110\u00ecnh Ngh\u1ec7 in 931.

He ordered Liu Hongcao to embark the army and sail to Giao.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}\n\nBy the time Liu Hongcao and the Southern Han expedition arrived in Vietnamese waters, Liu Hongcao's plan was to ascend the B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng River and to place his army in the heart of Giacannoto Chau before disembarking. The B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng was the major [[Maritime geography|riverine]] route into the [[Red River Delta|Red River plain]] from the north.\n\nNg\u00f4 Quy\u1ec1n anticipated this plan and brought his army to the mouth of the river. He had his men plant a barrier of large poles in the bed of the river. The tops of the poles reached just below the water level at high tide and were sharpened and tipped with iron. When Liu Hongcao appeared off the mouth of the river, Quyen sent out small, shallow-draft boats at high tide to provoke a fight and then retreat upriver, drawing the Chinese fleet in pursuit. As the tide fell, the heavy Chinese warships were caught on the poles and lay trapped in the middle of the river, whereupon they were attacked by Ng\u00f4 Quy\u1ec1n's forces.\n\nMore than half the Chinese drowned, including Liu Hongcao.<ref name=\"ZZTJ281\">''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', [[cmn:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377281|vol. 281]].</ref> When news of the battle reached Sea Gate, Liu Yan wept openly.

If low tide did not set in at time, Liu's boats would have easily sailed over the poles.

The B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng was the major [[Maritime geography|riverine]] route into the [[Red River Delta|Red River plain]] from the north.\n\nNg\u00f4 Quy\u1ec1n anticipated this plan and brought his army to the mouth of the river. He had his men plant a barrier of large poles in the bed of the river. The tops of the poles reached just below the water level at high tide and were sharpened and tipped with iron. When Liu Hongcao appeared off the mouth of the river, Quyen sent out small, shallow-draft boats at high tide to provoke a fight and then retreat upriver, drawing the Chinese fleet in pursuit. As the tide fell, the heavy Chinese warships were caught on the poles and lay trapped in the middle of the river, whereupon they were attacked by Ng\u00f4 Quy\u1ec1n's forces.\n\nMore than half the Chinese drowned, including Liu Hongcao.<ref name=\"ZZTJ281\">''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', [[cmn:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377281|vol. 281]].</ref> When news of the battle reached Sea Gate, Liu Yan wept openly.

Among these was Amado Carrillo Fuentes, who employed them as hitmen and transporters. Carrillo Fuentes ran the powerful Juarez Cartel and asked them to begin establishing drug trafficking routes stretching south to Colombia and north into the United States. \nThe BLO became allies of [[Los Zetas Cartel]], the former armed wing of the Gulf Cartel. The two organizations complement each other. The Zetas have their power base on the eastern U.S.-Mexico border and operate along the Caribbean coast through Central America. The BLO had its power base in the west, in Guerrero, Morelos and the State of Mexico. Combined, they had some of the more sophisticated and well-equipped paramilitaries in Mexico. However, there were also negatives. The two were allied for practical rather than ideological or family reasons. Their bond comes from their common enemy: the Sinaloa Cartel. Their alliance was therefore fragile.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wradio.com.mx/nota.aspx?id=800464 |title=Revela laptop operaciones de los Beltr\u00e1n Leyva |publisher=Wradio.com.mx |accessdate=2011-03-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=La Jornada |url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2008/05/10/index.php?section=politica&article=003n1pol |title=Sinaloa, en jaque por la violencia tras ser asesinado hijo del Chapo |publisher=Jornada.unam.mx |accessdate=2011-03-28}}</ref> Since February 2010 they fought along Los Zetas against all other Mexican cartels.<ref name='MexiData'/> The [[South Pacific Cartel]] is a branch of the splintered Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva Cartel.<ref>{{cite news | first = Justino Miranda | title = Arresto de \"El Ponchis\" exhibe vac\u00edos legales | date = December 4, 2010 | url = http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/primera/35971.html | work = El Universal | accessdate = 2010-12-06 | language = Spanish}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nThe Beltr\u00e1n Leyva clan was ruthless and ambitious. Their home municipality, Badiraguato, is the same that of as [[Joaquin Guzman Loera]], and there is some evidence they worked together as hitmen in the infamous Guadalajara Cartel.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Through marriage, the Guzman Loera and Beltran Leyva families became closer and more tightly aligned. This connection proved critical when Guzman was jailed in 1993. The Beltran Leyva brothers helped Guzman's brother, Arturo, maintain the business; they supplied cash to Guzman while in prison and helped him escape in 2001.\n\nGuzman's escape, the capture of his brother Arturo several months later, and the death of Carrillo Fuentes opened the door for the Beltran Leyva brothers. After several meetings in 2002 with Guzman and his partners, [[Juan Jose Esparragoza Moreno]], and [[Ismael Zambada Garcia]], the group formed what became known as The Federation, or the \"Alianza de Sangre\" (Blood Alliance); [[Alfredo Beltran Leyva]] is married to Guzman's cousin. Esparragoza married Guzman's sister-in-law. Guzman later married the niece of another partner, [[Ignacio Coronel Villarreal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/nacion/179403.html|title=El Universal - Naci\u00f3n - El c\u00e1rtel de Sinaloa, una \"alianza de sangre\"|date=July 10, 2015|work=El Universal|accessdate=April 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAs godfather to [[Amado Carrillo Fuentes]]\u2019 son, Esparragoza was also closely tied to the Carrillo Fuentes clan. That Juarez-based family was brought into the pact in the 2002, but it would not last. In 2004, Amado Carrillo Fuentes' brother, Rodolfo Carrillo Fuentes killed two of Guzman's operatives in Ciudad Juarez. Guzman had him assassinated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.noroeste.com.mx/publicaciones.php?id=409384|title=La muerte de Rodolfo Carrillo|publisher=|accessdate=April 23, 2016}}</ref> Faced with a choice, Zambada and Esparragoza picked Guzman's side, and the war between the Sinaloa and Juarez organizations has raged ever since.<ref>http://elorbe.com/seccion-politica/articulos/10/17/el-violento-retador-de-el-chapo.html</ref>\n\nIn the meantime, the Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva Organization (BLO) began to build their power. Guzman commissioned as his security team and armed wing to combat the rising power of their other rivals, the Gulf Cartel. A few years earlier, the Gulf Cartel had lured 31 special forces officers from the Mexican military to create a powerful, sophisticated and brutal armed wing that called themselves [[Los Zetas]]. The BLO recruited their own operatives. One operative, [[Edgar Valdez Villareal]] formed an armed wing, [[Los Pelones]], and began to match Zetas\u2019 brutality. Another allied armed group, [[Los Negros]], was led by a former police detective. At the top of the pyramid was [[Arturo Beltran Leyva]]. Arturo created his own unit which he called \"Arturo's Special Forces\" (Fuerzas Especiales de Arturo \u2013 FEDA). The war soon spread, as did the BLO's power and influence. By 2005, the BLO was reportedly operating in 11 states: Guerrero, Morelos, Chiapas, Queretaro, Sinaloa, Jalisco, Quintana Roo, Tamaulipas, Nuevo Leon, Mexico State and the Federal District (Mexico City).{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\nGuzman also tasked the Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva clan with penetrating the security and political forces, which they did with efficiency. In 2005, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) recorded a conversation between Nahum Acosta, a close advisor to the Fox administration, and one of the Beltran Leyva, presumably Hector.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4240561.stm |work=BBC News | title=Mexican aide held on 'drug links' | date=February 6, 2005}}</ref> Hector was responsible for payroll, which also allegedly included top members of the government's National Investigative Agency (Agencia Federal de Investigacion \u2013 AFI) and the country's drug czar, [[Noe Ramirez Mandujano]].<ref name=\"carlos captured\"/> Ramirez is in jail awaiting trial for allegedly receiving US$450,000 per month from the organization; Acosta was arrested but later exonerated.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/latinamerica/la-fg-bribe22-2008nov22,0,5384359.story | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Ken | last=Ellingwood | title=Mexico traffickers bribed former anti-drug chief, officials say | date=November 22, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe BLO, however, suffered from hubris. Their public profile steadily rose, as did their public appearances in extravagant parties in places like Cuernavaca where their domain was undisputed.  Added to this was a dispute over a distribution route in Chicago between the Sinaloa faction and the BLO. Tension boiled over when authorities arrested Alfredo Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva on January 21, 2008. After authorities released Guzman's son, Ivan Archivaldo, from jail on a technicality, Arturo Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva assumed that Guzman had provided the information leading to the arrest of his younger brother Alfredo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.borderlandbeat.com/2010/08/beltran-leyva-cartel.html|title=Borderland Beat: Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva Cartel|author=Buggs|publisher=|accessdate=April 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWar was declared, and one of the first victims was Edgar Guzman, Joaquin Guzman's son, who was killed when he left a Sinaloa shopping center with his bodyguards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.informador.com.mx/mexico/2008/10962/6/confirman-muerte-de-hijo-del-chapo.htm|title=Confirman muerte de hijo del Chapo|work=EL INFORMADOR|accessdate=April 23, 2016}}</ref>\nThe levels of bloodshed in Sinaloa increased. The BLO allied themselves with their former arch-rivals, Los Zetas. The Sinaloa Cartel reached working agreements with the Gulf Cartel and the Familia Michoacana, a ruthless group that had burst onto the scene in 2006. Throughout, Guzman, Zambada and Esparragoza remained aligned against the BLO.\nUsing their contacts in the federal government, the Sinaloa Cartel wore down the BLO. Dozens of operatives were arrested or killed in 2009. And in December, 2009, Mexican Marines killed Arturo Beltran Leyva after he\u2019d barricaded himself into an apartment in an upscale neighborhood in Cuernavaca.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lavozlibre.com/noticias/ampliar/29927/arturo-beltran-leyva-resucita-en-sus-fotos-mas-sangrientas|title=Arturo Beltr\u00e1n Leyva resucita en sus fotos m\u00e1s sangrientas|publisher=|accessdate=April 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe year 2010 was even worse for the BLO.

Among these was Amado Carrillo Fuentes, who employed them as hitmen and transporters. Carrillo Fuentes ran the powerful Juarez Cartel and asked them to begin establishing drug trafficking routes stretching south to Colombia and north into the United States. \nThe BLO became allies of [[Los Zetas Cartel]], the former armed wing of the Gulf Cartel. The two organizations complement each other. The Zetas have their power base on the eastern U.S.-Mexico border and operate along the Caribbean coast through Central America. The BLO had its power base in the west, in Guerrero, Morelos and the State of Mexico. Combined, they had some of the more sophisticated and well-equipped paramilitaries in Mexico. However, there were also negatives. The two were allied for practical rather than ideological or family reasons. Their bond comes from their common enemy: the Sinaloa Cartel. Their alliance was therefore fragile.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wradio.com.mx/nota.aspx?id=800464 |title=Revela laptop operaciones de los Beltr\u00e1n Leyva |publisher=Wradio.com.mx |accessdate=2011-03-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=La Jornada |url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2008/05/10/index.php?section=politica&article=003n1pol |title=Sinaloa, en jaque por la violencia tras ser asesinado hijo del Chapo |publisher=Jornada.unam.mx |accessdate=2011-03-28}}</ref> Since February 2010 they fought along Los Zetas against all other Mexican cartels.<ref name='MexiData'/> The [[South Pacific Cartel]] is a branch of the splintered Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva Cartel.<ref>{{cite news | first = Justino Miranda | title = Arresto de \"El Ponchis\" exhibe vac\u00edos legales | date = December 4, 2010 | url = http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/primera/35971.html | work = El Universal | accessdate = 2010-12-06 | language = Spanish}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nThe Beltr\u00e1n Leyva clan was ruthless and ambitious. Their home municipality, Badiraguato, is the same that of as [[Joaquin Guzman Loera]], and there is some evidence they worked together as hitmen in the infamous Guadalajara Cartel.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Through marriage, the Guzman Loera and Beltran Leyva families became closer and more tightly aligned. This connection proved critical when Guzman was jailed in 1993. The Beltran Leyva brothers helped Guzman's brother, Arturo, maintain the business; they supplied cash to Guzman while in prison and helped him escape in 2001.\n\nGuzman's escape, the capture of his brother Arturo several months later, and the death of Carrillo Fuentes opened the door for the Beltran Leyva brothers. After several meetings in 2002 with Guzman and his partners, [[Juan Jose Esparragoza Moreno]], and [[Ismael Zambada Garcia]], the group formed what became known as The Federation, or the \"Alianza de Sangre\" (Blood Alliance); [[Alfredo Beltran Leyva]] is married to Guzman's cousin. Esparragoza married Guzman's sister-in-law. Guzman later married the niece of another partner, [[Ignacio Coronel Villarreal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/nacion/179403.html|title=El Universal - Naci\u00f3n - El c\u00e1rtel de Sinaloa, una \"alianza de sangre\"|date=July 10, 2015|work=El Universal|accessdate=April 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAs godfather to [[Amado Carrillo Fuentes]]\u2019 son, Esparragoza was also closely tied to the Carrillo Fuentes clan. That Juarez-based family was brought into the pact in the 2002, but it would not last. In 2004, Amado Carrillo Fuentes' brother, Rodolfo Carrillo Fuentes killed two of Guzman's operatives in Ciudad Juarez. Guzman had him assassinated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.noroeste.com.mx/publicaciones.php?id=409384|title=La muerte de Rodolfo Carrillo|publisher=|accessdate=April 23, 2016}}</ref> Faced with a choice, Zambada and Esparragoza picked Guzman's side, and the war between the Sinaloa and Juarez organizations has raged ever since.<ref>http://elorbe.com/seccion-politica/articulos/10/17/el-violento-retador-de-el-chapo.html</ref>\n\nIn the meantime, the Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva Organization (BLO) began to build their power. Guzman commissioned as his security team and armed wing to combat the rising power of their other rivals, the Gulf Cartel. A few years earlier, the Gulf Cartel had lured 31 special forces officers from the Mexican military to create a powerful, sophisticated and brutal armed wing that called themselves [[Los Zetas]]. The BLO recruited their own operatives. One operative, [[Edgar Valdez Villareal]] formed an armed wing, [[Los Pelones]], and began to match Zetas\u2019 brutality. Another allied armed group, [[Los Negros]], was led by a former police detective. At the top of the pyramid was [[Arturo Beltran Leyva]]. Arturo created his own unit which he called \"Arturo's Special Forces\" (Fuerzas Especiales de Arturo \u2013 FEDA). The war soon spread, as did the BLO's power and influence. By 2005, the BLO was reportedly operating in 11 states: Guerrero, Morelos, Chiapas, Queretaro, Sinaloa, Jalisco, Quintana Roo, Tamaulipas, Nuevo Leon, Mexico State and the Federal District (Mexico City).{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\nGuzman also tasked the Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva clan with penetrating the security and political forces, which they did with efficiency. In 2005, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) recorded a conversation between Nahum Acosta, a close advisor to the Fox administration, and one of the Beltran Leyva, presumably Hector.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4240561.stm |work=BBC News | title=Mexican aide held on 'drug links' | date=February 6, 2005}}</ref> Hector was responsible for payroll, which also allegedly included top members of the government's National Investigative Agency (Agencia Federal de Investigacion \u2013 AFI) and the country's drug czar, [[Noe Ramirez Mandujano]].<ref name=\"carlos captured\"/> Ramirez is in jail awaiting trial for allegedly receiving US$450,000 per month from the organization; Acosta was arrested but later exonerated.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/latinamerica/la-fg-bribe22-2008nov22,0,5384359.story | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Ken | last=Ellingwood | title=Mexico traffickers bribed former anti-drug chief, officials say | date=November 22, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe BLO, however, suffered from hubris. Their public profile steadily rose, as did their public appearances in extravagant parties in places like Cuernavaca where their domain was undisputed.  Added to this was a dispute over a distribution route in Chicago between the Sinaloa faction and the BLO. Tension boiled over when authorities arrested Alfredo Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva on January 21, 2008. After authorities released Guzman's son, Ivan Archivaldo, from jail on a technicality, Arturo Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva assumed that Guzman had provided the information leading to the arrest of his younger brother Alfredo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.borderlandbeat.com/2010/08/beltran-leyva-cartel.html|title=Borderland Beat: Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva Cartel|author=Buggs|publisher=|accessdate=April 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWar was declared, and one of the first victims was Edgar Guzman, Joaquin Guzman's son, who was killed when he left a Sinaloa shopping center with his bodyguards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.informador.com.mx/mexico/2008/10962/6/confirman-muerte-de-hijo-del-chapo.htm|title=Confirman muerte de hijo del Chapo|work=EL INFORMADOR|accessdate=April 23, 2016}}</ref>\nThe levels of bloodshed in Sinaloa increased. The BLO allied themselves with their former arch-rivals, Los Zetas. The Sinaloa Cartel reached working agreements with the Gulf Cartel and the Familia Michoacana, a ruthless group that had burst onto the scene in 2006. Throughout, Guzman, Zambada and Esparragoza remained aligned against the BLO.\nUsing their contacts in the federal government, the Sinaloa Cartel wore down the BLO. Dozens of operatives were arrested or killed in 2009.

His father was from a prominent New England family and a successful businessman. His firm, J. B. Swasey Commission Company, had offices in Boston, London, and [[Melbourne]], Australia. Although the family was normally resident in Boston, William Albert was born in Melbourne where his parents were temporarily sojourning. He was educated at [[Boston Latin School]], followed by a brief stint at a military boarding school in Paris before enrolling at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] where he studied architecture. He graduated in 1882 and began working for C. C. Height in New York before moving to Chicago where he worked for [[Burnham and Root]] and [[Henry Ives Cobb]].<ref name=\"Garrison\" /><ref name=\"Toft\" /><ref name=\"ESL\" />\n\nSwasey moved to St. Louis, Missouri in 1885 where he entered into an architectural partnership Charles K. Ramsey. Two years later, Swasey opened his own firm. From 1890 he was one of the chief architects of the residential development of Westminster Place and [[Portland and Westmoreland Places]] and is credited with introducing the city to [[Colonial Revival]] architecture. However, several of the houses he designed for Westmoreland Place, such as the mansion for the banker Jacob Craig Van Blarcom, were in the [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Italian Renaissance Revival]] style. Between 1890 and 1904, Swasey's other work included apartment and office buildings in St. Louis and New Orleans, a church in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], and privately commissioned houses in Pennsylvania and Missouri. In 1890, Swasey married Irene McNeal of Memphis Tennessee. She was the daughter of Albert McNeal, a prominent jurist, and the  great granddaughter of [[President James K. Polk]]. The couple had one son, McNeal Swasey (1891\u20131946) who also became an architect with a career largely based in California. The couple later divorced. Swasey remarried in 1914 to Eleanor Hinton.<ref name=\"Hunter\" /><ref name=\"PCAD\" /><ref name=\"Toft\" /><ref name=\"NRHP1\" />\n\nIn 1904 Swasey received a contract from the developers of [[Parkview, St. Louis|Parkview]] in St. Louis for the design of 20 new houses. However, before the development began, Swasey abruptly cancelled the contract and moved his practice to New York City. Two young associates in his St. Louis practice took it over and implemented some of his designs, all of which were in the Colonial Revival style. Once established in New York, Swasey began designing new theatres or remodelling existing ones for the [[Shubert family]]. He also designed the rebuilding of  George C. Tillou's [[Steeplechase Park|Steeplechase Amusement Park]] at [[Coney Island]] in 1907 and the Lido Club Hotel at [[Lido Beach, New York|Lido Beach]] during the same period.<ref name=\"Gass\" /><ref name=\"Toft\" />\n\nWith the [[Great Depression]], new commissions dried up and Swasey found himself in financial difficulty. An article in the ''[[New York Times]]'' of 6 December 1932 recounted how Swasey had fallen seriously in arrears with the alimony payments to his ex-wife, Irene McNeal Swasey. He claimed that he and his son were living on less than $1 a day. Nevertheless, the court ordered his property to be sequestered. His collection of architectural books was sold at an auction in 1932, and many of his designs and records from his time in New York were lost in his frequent changes of residence during the Depression. Swasey spent part of his later years in Florida where he designed a few houses in the [[Mission Revival architecture|Spanish Colonial style]]. He died of cancer at the [[Calvary Hospital (Bronx)|Calvary Hospital]] in New York City in 1940, survived by his second wife, Eleanor, and his sons, McNeal Swasey from his first marriage, and Albert Swasey from his second. He was buried in [[Ferncliff Cemetery]].<ref name=\"NYT1\" /><ref name=\"Toft\" /><ref name=\"NYC1\" />\n\n==Domestic architecture in St. Louis==\nSwasey designed fourteen houses for [[Joseph Scott Fullerton]]'s real estate development in Westminster Place, including his own Colonial Revival-style residence at 4384 Westminster Place. He also designed the ornamental gates to the development. For Fullerton's development of Portland and Westmoreland Places and their adjoining streets he designed a further six houses, including a mansion on Lindell Boulevard for the industrialist James Green, and another for [[William K. Bixby]] at 13 Portland Place.<ref name=\"NRHP1\" /><ref name=\"Hunter\" /><ref name=\"Gass\" />\n<gallery class= mode=\"packed\" widths=150px heights=160px caption = >\nFile:James Green Residence.

His father was from a prominent New England family and a successful businessman. His firm, J. B. Swasey Commission Company, had offices in Boston, London, and [[Melbourne]], Australia. Although the family was normally resident in Boston, William Albert was born in Melbourne where his parents were temporarily sojourning. He was educated at [[Boston Latin School]], followed by a brief stint at a military boarding school in Paris before enrolling at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] where he studied architecture. He graduated in 1882 and began working for C. C. Height in New York before moving to Chicago where he worked for [[Burnham and Root]] and [[Henry Ives Cobb]].<ref name=\"Garrison\" /><ref name=\"Toft\" /><ref name=\"ESL\" />\n\nSwasey moved to St. Louis, Missouri in 1885 where he entered into an architectural partnership Charles K. Ramsey. Two years later, Swasey opened his own firm. From 1890 he was one of the chief architects of the residential development of Westminster Place and [[Portland and Westmoreland Places]] and is credited with introducing the city to [[Colonial Revival]] architecture. However, several of the houses he designed for Westmoreland Place, such as the mansion for the banker Jacob Craig Van Blarcom, were in the [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Italian Renaissance Revival]] style. Between 1890 and 1904, Swasey's other work included apartment and office buildings in St. Louis and New Orleans, a church in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], and privately commissioned houses in Pennsylvania and Missouri. In 1890, Swasey married Irene McNeal of Memphis Tennessee. She was the daughter of Albert McNeal, a prominent jurist, and the  great granddaughter of [[President James K. Polk]]. The couple had one son, McNeal Swasey (1891\u20131946) who also became an architect with a career largely based in California. The couple later divorced. Swasey remarried in 1914 to Eleanor Hinton.<ref name=\"Hunter\" /><ref name=\"PCAD\" /><ref name=\"Toft\" /><ref name=\"NRHP1\" />\n\nIn 1904 Swasey received a contract from the developers of [[Parkview, St. Louis|Parkview]] in St. Louis for the design of 20 new houses. However, before the development began, Swasey abruptly cancelled the contract and moved his practice to New York City. Two young associates in his St. Louis practice took it over and implemented some of his designs, all of which were in the Colonial Revival style. Once established in New York, Swasey began designing new theatres or remodelling existing ones for the [[Shubert family]]. He also designed the rebuilding of  George C. Tillou's [[Steeplechase Park|Steeplechase Amusement Park]] at [[Coney Island]] in 1907 and the Lido Club Hotel at [[Lido Beach, New York|Lido Beach]] during the same period.<ref name=\"Gass\" /><ref name=\"Toft\" />\n\nWith the [[Great Depression]], new commissions dried up and Swasey found himself in financial difficulty. An article in the ''[[New York Times]]'' of 6 December 1932 recounted how Swasey had fallen seriously in arrears with the alimony payments to his ex-wife, Irene McNeal Swasey. He claimed that he and his son were living on less than $1 a day. Nevertheless, the court ordered his property to be sequestered. His collection of architectural books were sold at an auction in 1932, and many of his designs and records from his time in New York were lost in his frequent changes of residence during the Depression. Swasey spent part of his later years in Florida where he designed a few houses in the [[Mission Revival architecture|Spanish Colonial style]]. He died of cancer at the [[Calvary Hospital (Bronx)|Calvary Hospital]] in New York City in 1940, survived by his second wife, Eleanor, and his sons, McNeal Swasey from his first marriage, and Albert Swasey from his second. He was buried in [[Ferncliff Cemetery]].<ref name=\"NYT1\" /><ref name=\"Toft\" /><ref name=\"NYC1\" />\n\n==Domestic architecture in St. Louis==\nSwasey designed fourteen houses for [[Joseph Scott Fullerton]]'s real estate development in Westminster Place, including his own Colonial Revival-style residence at 4384 Westminster Place. He also designed the ornamental gates to the development. For Fullerton's development of Portland and Westmoreland Places and their adjoining streets he designed a further six houses, including a mansion on Lindell Boulevard for the industrialist James Green, and another for [[William K. Bixby]] at 13 Portland Place.<ref name=\"NRHP1\" /><ref name=\"Hunter\" /><ref name=\"Gass\" />\n<gallery class= mode=\"packed\" widths=150px heights=160px caption = >\nFile:James Green Residence.
