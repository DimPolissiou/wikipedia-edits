Stabilizing social rhythms helps to protect against disruptions of biological rhythms; individuals are more likely to maintain a rhythm when other people are involved to hold them accountable. \n\nInterpersonal work can involve addressing unresolved [[grief]] experiences including grief for the lost healthy self, negotiating a transition in a major life role, and resolving a role dispute with a significant other. These experiences can be disruptive to social rhythms and thus, serve as targets of treatment to prevent the onset and recurrence of mood episodes seen in [[bipolar disorder]]. \n\n== Phases of Treatment ==\nIPSRT typically proceeds in four phases:<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\n# The initial phase involves a review of the patient\u2019s mental health history in order to elucidate patterns in the associations between social routine disruptions, interpersonal problems and affective episodes. [[Psychoeducation]] about BD and the importance of stable routines to mood maintenance is provided. Additionally, ''The Interpersonal Inventory'' is used to assess the quality of the patient\u2019s interpersonal relationships. One of four interpersonal problem areas is chosen to focus on:\n## Grief (e.g. loss of loved one, loss of healthy self)\n## Role transitions (e.g. married-to-divorced, parenthood)\n## Role disputes (e.g. conflict with spouse or parents)\n## Interpersonal deficits (e.g. persistent social isolation)  The ''Social Rhythm Metric'' (SRM) is used to assess the regularity of social routines. Target and actual time of the following activities are tracked on a daily basis: got out of bed; first contact with another person; started work, school, or housework; ate dinner; and went into bed. The intensity of involvement with other people is also rated: 0 = alone, 1 = others present, 2 = others actively involved, and 3 = others very stimulating.

This can also refer to grief for the loss of a healthy self (i.e., the person before the illness or the person one could have become, if not for BD). Strategies include encouraging expression of painful feelings about lost hopes, ruined relationships, interrupted careers, and passed opportunities. This is followed by encouragement to develop new relationships, establish new, more realistic goals, and focus on future opportunities.\n# ''Interpersonal role disputes'' \u2013 This refers to any close relationship in which there are nonreciprocal expectations, such as in marital conflict and arguments with parental figures. Strategies include learning how to be more patient, tolerant, and accepting of limitations in self and others<ref name=\":1\" />. This, in turn, can lead to fewer critical and argumentative instincts.\n# ''Role transition'' \u2013 This refers to any major life role change, such as new employment, graduation, retirement, marriage, divorce, and giving birth. This can also refer to the loss of previously pleasurable hypomania. Strategies can include noting the negative consequences of hypomania and encouraging the identification of rewarding life goals as suitable alternatives.\n# ''Interpersonal deficits'' \u2013 This refers to a long-standing history of impoverished or contentious social relationships, leading to an overall feeling of dissatisfaction. Strategies include identifying the common thread in the multiple disputes across one\u2019s life and possibly working to restore \u201cburnt bridges\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />.\n\n== Social Rhythm Strategies ==\nIndividuals with BD benefit from a higher level of stability in their sleep and daily routines than those with no history of affective illness<ref name=\":1\" />. It is important to identify situations in which routines can be thrown off balance, whether by excessive activity and overstimulation or lack of activity and under-stimulation. Once destabilizing triggers are identified, reasonable goals for change are established. Specific strategies include:\n\n# Encouraging proper sleep hygiene to introduce regularity to sleep-wake cycle\n## Establish a regular wake and sleep time\n## Avoid caffeine or other stimulants\n## Use the bed only for sleep and sex, not for watching TV, doing homework, reading etc.\n## Align sunlight exposure with wake time to help set circadian clock\n# Maintaining regular meal times throughout the day\n## Plan ahead by meal prepping the day before\n## Include snack times if needed to encourage consistent eating habits\n# Encouraging medication adherence and establishing a regular schedule\n## Use alarms on phone as reminders for when to take pills\n## Use daily pillboxes to keep track of which pills to take at certain times\n# Monitoring frequency and intensity of social interactions using ''Social Rhythm Metric''\n## Note time at which interactions happen and adjust accordingly to establish regularity\n# Minimizing overstimulation of social interactions\n## Avoid frequent parties or events\n## Use recovery days as needed\n# Addressing under-stimulation with [[behavioral activation]]\n## Engage in activities that are pleasurable and that give one a sense of mastery\n## Focus on small, manageable goals that can lead to engagement in other activities (e.g., start jogging to get in shape prior to joining a basketball team)\n# Identifying interpersonal sources of stabilizing and destabilizing influence\n## Spend time with those who are supportive and stabilizing\n## Reduce time with those who are disruptive\n\n== Evidence of IPSRT Efficacy ==\nIn a randomized controlled trial, those who received IPSRT during the acute treatment phase went longer without a new affective episode ([[Depression (mood)|depression]] or [[mania]]) than those who received intensive clinical management. Participants in the IPSRT group also had higher regularity of social rhythms at the end of acute treatment, which was associated with reduced likelihood of relapse during maintenance phase<ref name=\":2\" />.

Stabilizing social rhythms helps to protect against disruptions of biological rhythms; individuals are more likely to maintain a rhythm when other people are involved to hold them accountable. \n\nInterpersonal work can involve addressing unresolved [[grief]] experiences including grief for the lost healthy self, negotiating a transition in a major life role, and resolving a role dispute with a significant other. These experiences can be disruptive to social rhythms and thus, serve as targets of treatment to prevent the onset and recurrence of mood episodes seen in [[bipolar disorder]]. \n\n== Phases of Treatment ==\nIPSRT typically proceeds in four phases:<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\n# The initial phase involves a review of the patient\u2019s mental health history in order to elucidate patterns in the associations between social routine disruptions, interpersonal problems and affective episodes. [[Psychoeducation]] about BD and the importance of stable routines to mood maintenance is provided. Additionally, ''The Interpersonal Inventory'' is used to assess the quality of the patient\u2019s interpersonal relationships. One of four interpersonal problem areas is chosen to focus on:\n## Grief (e.g. loss of loved one, loss of healthy self)\n## Role transitions (e.g. married-to-divorced, parenthood)\n## Role disputes (e.g. conflict with spouse or parents)\n## Interpersonal deficits (e.g. persistent social isolation)  The ''Social Rhythm Metric'' (SRM) is used to assess the regularity of social routines. Target and actual time of the following activities are tracked on a daily basis: got out of bed; first contact with another person; started work, school, or housework; ate dinner; and went into bed. The intensity of involvement with other people is also rated: 0 = alone, 1 = others present, 2 = others actively involved, and 3 = others very stimulating. Finally, mood is rated on a scale of -5 to +5 at the end of each day.\n# The intermediate phase focuses on bringing regularity to social rhythms and intervening in the interpersonal problem area of interest.\n## ''Social Rhythm Metric'' is heavily used to assess amount of activity being engaged in and the impact of activity on mood. The regularity (or irregularity) of activities is examined, and the patient and therapist collaboratively plan how to stabilize the daily routine by making incremental behavioral modifications until a regular target time at which these activities are done is achieved.\n## Sources of interpersonal distress are explored, and individuals in the patient\u2019s life who destabilize routine, along with those who are supportive, are identified. Frequency and intensity of social interactions, as well as other social rhythms (e.g. time at which returning home from school/work and then interacting with family), are discussed.\n# The maintenance phase aims to reinforce the techniques learned earlier in treatment in order to maintain social rhythms and positive interpersonal relationships.\n## Discussion of early warning signs of episodes are reviewed.\n## Symptomatic and functional change is monitored at each session by asking the patient to rate their mood and note any shifts in routine using the SRM.\n# The final phase involves termination in which sessions are gradually reduced in frequency.\n\n== Interpersonal Strategies ==\nOnce the interpersonal problem area of focus is chosen, the following strategies may be used:<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Frank|first=Ellen|last2=Swartz|first2=Holly A|last3=Kupfer|first3=David J|date=2000|title=Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy: managing the chaos of bipolar disorder|journal=Biological Psychiatry|volume=48|issue=6|pages=593\u2013604|doi=10.1016/s0006-3223(00)00969-0|issn=0006-3223}}</ref>\n\n# ''Grief'' \u2013 This refers to symptoms resulting from incomplete mourning or unresolved feelings about the death of an important person. This can also refer to grief for the loss of a healthy self (i.e., the person before the illness or the person one could have become, if not for BD). Strategies include encouraging expression of painful feelings about lost hopes, ruined relationships, interrupted careers, and passed opportunities. This is followed by encouragement to develop new relationships, establish new, more realistic goals, and focus on future opportunities.\n# ''Interpersonal role disputes'' \u2013 This refers to any close relationship in which there are nonreciprocal expectations, such as in marital conflict and arguments with parental figures. Strategies include learning how to be more patient, tolerant, and accepting of limitations in self and others<ref name=\":1\" />. This, in turn, can lead to fewer critical and argumentative instincts.\n# ''Role transition'' \u2013 This refers to any major life role change, such as new employment, graduation, retirement, marriage, divorce, and giving birth. This can also refer to the loss of previously pleasurable hypomania. Strategies can include noting the negative consequences of hypomania and encouraging the identification of rewarding life goals as suitable alternatives.\n# ''Interpersonal deficits'' \u2013 This refers to a long-standing history of impoverished or contentious social relationships, leading to an overall feeling of dissatisfaction. Strategies include identifying the common thread in the multiple disputes across one\u2019s life and possibly working to restore \u201cburnt bridges\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />.\n\n== Social Rhythm Strategies ==\nIndividuals with BD benefit from a higher level of stability in their sleep and daily routines than those with no history of affective illness<ref name=\":1\" />. It is important to identify situations in which routines can be thrown off balance, whether by excessive activity and overstimulation or lack of activity and under-stimulation. Once destabilizing triggers are identified, reasonable goals for change are established. Specific strategies include:\n\n# Encouraging proper sleep hygiene to introduce regularity to sleep-wake cycle\n## Establish a regular wake and sleep time\n## Avoid caffeine or other stimulants\n## Use the bed only for sleep and sex, not for watching TV, doing homework, reading etc.\n## Align sunlight exposure with wake time to help set circadian clock\n# Maintaining regular meal times throughout the day\n## Plan ahead by meal prepping the day before\n## Include snack times if needed to encourage consistent eating habits\n# Encouraging medication adherence and establishing a regular schedule\n## Use alarms on phone as reminders for when to take pills\n## Use daily pillboxes to keep track of which pills to take at certain times\n# Monitoring frequency and intensity of social interactions using ''Social Rhythm Metric''\n## Note time at which interactions happen and adjust accordingly to establish regularity\n# Minimizing overstimulation of social interactions\n## Avoid frequent parties or events\n## Use recovery days as needed\n# Addressing under-stimulation with [[behavioral activation]]\n## Engage in activities that are pleasurable and that give one a sense of mastery\n## Focus on small, manageable goals that can lead to engagement in other activities (e.g., start jogging to get in shape prior to joining a basketball team)\n# Identifying interpersonal sources of stabilizing and destabilizing influence\n## Spend time with those who are supportive and stabilizing\n## Reduce time with those who are disruptive\n\n== Evidence of IPSRT Efficacy ==\nIn a randomized controlled trial, those who received IPSRT during the acute treatment phase went longer without a new affective episode ([[Depression (mood)|depression]] or [[mania]]) than those who received intensive clinical management. Participants in the IPSRT group also had higher regularity of social rhythms at the end of acute treatment, which was associated with reduced likelihood of relapse during maintenance phase<ref name=\":2\" />. Additionally, those who received IPSRT showed more rapid improvement in occupational functioning than those assigned to intensive clinical management.

He left initially for [[Algiers]], where he met [[Che Guevara]], [[Am\u00edlcar Cabral]] and [[Malcolm X]]. From there, he went to [[Cairo]], Rome, [[Geneva]] and [[Havana]], trying to unite the revolutionary movements of the [[Third World]] for the [[Tricontinental Conference]] meeting that was to be held in January 1966 in Havana. In a press conference, he claimed \"the two currents of the world revolution will be represented there: the current [that] emerged with the [[October Revolution]] and that of the national liberation revolution\".\n\nAs the leader of the Tricontinental Conference, Ben Barka was a major figure in the Third World movement and supported [[revolution]]ary [[anticolonialism|anti-colonial]] action in various states; this provoked the anger of the United States and France. Just before his disappearance, he was preparing the first meeting of the Tricontinental, scheduled to take place in Havana. The [[OSPAAAL]] (Spanish for \"Organization for Solidarity with the People of Africa, Asia and Latin America\") was founded on that occasion.\n\nChairing the preparatory commission, he defined the objectives; assistance with the movements of liberation, support for Cuba during its subjection to the [[United States embargo against Cuba|United States embargo]], the liquidation of [[US military bases|foreign military bases]] and [[apartheid in South Africa]]. For the historian Ren\u00e9 Galissot, \"The underlying reason for the removal and assassination of Ben Barka is to be found in this revolutionary impetus of Tricontinentale.\"\n\n==Disappearance==\nOn 29 October 1965, Mehdi Ben Barka was abducted (\"[[forced disappearance|disappeared]]\") in Paris by French policemen and never seen again.

French intelligence agents and the Israeli [[Mossad]] were also involved, according to the article. According to [[Tad Szulc]], Israeli involvement was in the wake of the successful Moroccan-Israeli collaboration in the 1961\u201364 [[Operation Yachin]]; he claims that [[Meir Amit]] located Ben Barka, whereupon Mossad agents persuaded him to come to Paris where he was to be arrested by the French police.{{sfn|Szulc|1991|p=275|ps=: \"By mid-1963, Operation Yakhin had become virtually routine. Colonel Oufkir, the new Interior Minister in Morocco, and [[Meir Amit]], the new chief of the Mossad, concluded a secret pact that year providing for the training of Moroccan security services by the Israelis and limited covert military assistance in exchange for a flow of intelligence on Arab affairs and continued free departures of Jews. In 1965, the Mossad rendered Oufkir the shocking and sinister service of tracking down Mehdi Ben-Barka, the leader of the leftist opposition in Morocco, whom both the king and his Interior Minister wished dead. Amit agreed to locate Ben-Barka, and Mossad agents persuaded him to come to Paris from Geneva under false pretenses. Near a restaurant, French plainclothesmen arrested Ben-Barka and handed him over to Oufkir\u2019s agents. They then took him to the countryside, killed him and buried him in a garden.

He said Ben Barka's body was then taken back to Morocco and destroyed in a vat of acid. Furthermore, he declared that this vat of acid, whose plans were reproduced by the newspapers, had been constructed under instructions from the CIA agent \"[[Colonel]] Martin\", who had learnt this technique to make corpses disappear during his appointment in the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah's Iran]] in the 1950s.\n\n===Ali Bourequat===\nMoroccan-French [[dissident]] and former [[Tazmamart]] [[prisoner of conscience]] [[Ali Bourequat]] claims in his book ''In the Moroccan King's Secret Garden'' to have met a former Moroccan secret agent in a prison near [[Rabat]] in 1973\u201374. The man, Dubail, recounted how he and some colleagues, led by Colonel Oufkir and [[Ahmed Dlimi]], had murdered Ben Barka in Paris.\n\nThe body was then encapsulated in [[cement]] and buried outside Paris, but his head was brought by Oufkir to Morocco in a [[suitcase]].

[[Defence minister]] [[Mich\u00e8le Alliot-Marie]] had agreed in 2004 to follow the recommendations of a national defence committee and released the 73 additional classified documents on the case. However, the son of Mehdi Ben Barka was outraged at what he called a \"pseudo-release of files\", insisting that information had been withheld which could have implicated the [[Service de Documentation Ext\u00e9rieure et de Contre-Espionnage|French secret services]] (SDECE), and possibly the CIA and the Mossad, as well as the ultimate responsibility of King Hassan II of Morocco\u2013who conveniently was able to put the blame on Oufkir after his failed coup in 1972.<ref>[http://www.lefigaro.fr/international/20060523.FIG000000128_affaire_ben_barka_driss_basri_chez_le_juge.html Affaire Ben Barka : Driss Basri chez le juge], ''[[Le Figaro]]'', 23 May 2006 {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\n===Driss Basri===\n[[Driss Basri]], Interior Minister of Hassan II and his right-hand man from the early 1980s to the late 1990s, was heard by the judge Patrick Rama\u00ebl in May 2006, as a witness, concerning Ben Barka's kidnapping.

In September, 1965 the King had allowed the Mossad to install electronic eavesdropping devices in \"all the meeting rooms and private suites of the leaders of the Arab states and their military commanders during an Arab summit in Casablanca\", giving Israel \"an unprecedented glimpse\" of the military and intelligence secrets of its greatest enemies, and of the mindsets of those countries' leaders. Information transferred to Israel from the Casablanca summit about the shaky state of the Arab armies was \"one of the foundations for the confidence felt by IDF chiefs\" when they recommended their government to wage war two years later (the 1967 [[Six-Day War]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4639608,00.html|title=The ghosts of Saint-Germain forest|date=2015-03-23|website=Ynetnews|language=en|access-date=2019-03-31}}</ref> But just one day after the Mossad had received the transcripts from this Arab summit, a top Moroccan intelligence service chief, [[Ahmed Dlimi]] requested - on behalf of King Hassan II - that the Israelis immediately repay the favor by assassinating Ben Barka.  According to Bergman's sources, the Mossad did not actually carry out the killing but played a key role in locating Barka and giving that information to Moroccan authorities so they could place him under surveillance; the Mossad created the plan for the kidnapping - which was to be carried out by the Moroccans themselves.  \"The Mossad supplied the Moroccans with safe houses in Paris, vehicles, fake passports, and two different kinds of poison with which to kill [Barka], as well as shovels and 'something to disguise the traces'\".

He left initially for [[Algiers]], where he met [[Che Guevara]], [[Am\u00edlcar Cabral]] and [[Malcolm X]]. From there, he went to [[Cairo]], Rome, [[Geneva]] and [[Havana]], trying to unite the revolutionary movements of the [[Third World]] for the [[Tricontinental Conference]] meeting that was to be held in January 1966 in Havana. In a press conference, he claimed \"the two currents of the world revolution will be represented there: the current [that] emerged with the [[October Revolution]] and that of the national liberation revolution\".\n\nAs the leader of the Tricontinental Conference, Ben Barka was a major figure in the Third World movement and supported [[revolution]]ary [[anticolonialism|anti-colonial]] action in various states; this provoked the anger of the United States and France. Just before his disappearance, he was preparing the first meeting of the Tricontinental, scheduled to take place in Havana. The [[OSPAAAL]] (Spanish for \"Organization for Solidarity with the People of Africa, Asia and Latin America\") was founded on that occasion.\n\nChairing the preparatory commission, he defined the objectives; assistance with the movements of liberation, support for Cuba during its subjection to the [[United States embargo against Cuba|United States embargo]], the liquidation of [[US military bases|foreign military bases]] and [[apartheid in South Africa]]. For the historian Ren\u00e9 Galissot, \"The underlying reason for the removal and assassination of Ben Barka is to be found in this revolutionary impetus of Tricontinentale.\"\n\n==Disappearance==\nOn 29 October 1965, Mehdi Ben Barka was abducted (\"[[forced disappearance|disappeared]]\") in Paris by French policemen and never seen again. On 29 December 1975, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine published an article titled \"The Murder of Mehdi Ben Barka\",<ref>{{cite news |title=The Murder of Mehdi Ben Barka |date=December 29, 1975 |work=Time |url=https://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,945444,00.html }}</ref> stating that three Moroccan agents were responsible for the death of Ben Barka, one of them former [[Interior Minister]] [[Mohamed Oufkir]].

French intelligence agents and the Israeli [[Mossad]] were also involved, according to the article. According to [[Tad Szulc]], Israeli involvement was in the wake of the successful Moroccan-Israeli collaboration in the 1961\u201364 [[Operation Yachin]]; he claims that [[Meir Amit]] located Ben Barka, whereupon Mossad agents persuaded him to come to Paris where he was to be arrested by the French police.{{sfn|Szulc|1991|p=275|ps=: \"By mid-1963, Operation Yakhin had become virtually routine. Colonel Oufkir, the new Interior Minister in Morocco, and [[Meir Amit]], the new chief of the Mossad, concluded a secret pact that year providing for the training of Moroccan security services by the Israelis and limited covert military assistance in exchange for a flow of intelligence on Arab affairs and continued free departures of Jews. In 1965, the Mossad rendered Oufkir the shocking and sinister service of tracking down Mehdi Ben-Barka, the leader of the leftist opposition in Morocco, whom both the king and his Interior Minister wished dead. Amit agreed to locate Ben-Barka, and Mossad agents persuaded him to come to Paris from Geneva under false pretenses. Near a restaurant, French plainclothesmen arrested Ben-Barka and handed him over to Oufkir\u2019s agents. They then took him to the countryside, killed him and buried him in a garden.

Furthermore, he declared that this vat of acid, whose plans were reproduced by the newspapers, had been constructed under instructions from the CIA agent \"[[Colonel]] Martin\", who had learnt this technique to make corpses disappear during his appointment in the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah's Iran]] in the 1950s.\n\n===Ali Bourequat===\nMoroccan-French [[dissident]] and former [[Tazmamart]] [[prisoner of conscience]] [[Ali Bourequat]] claims in his book ''In the Moroccan King's Secret Garden'' to have met a former Moroccan secret agent in a prison near [[Rabat]] in 1973\u201374. The man, Dubail, recounted how he and some colleagues, led by Colonel Oufkir and [[Ahmed Dlimi]], had murdered Ben Barka in Paris.\n\nThe body was then encapsulated in [[cement]] and buried outside Paris, but his head was brought by Oufkir to Morocco in a [[suitcase]]. Thereafter, it was buried in the same prison grounds where Dubail and Bourequat were held.\n\n===CIA documents===\nOwing to requests made through the [[Freedom of Information Act]], the United States government acknowledged in 1976 that the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) possessed 1,800 documents involving Ben Barka; however, the documents were not released.\n\n===French documents===\nSome secret French documents on the affair were made public in 2001, causing political uproar. [[Defence minister]] [[Mich\u00e8le Alliot-Marie]] had agreed in 2004 to follow the recommendations of a national defence committee and released the 73 additional classified documents on the case. However, the son of Mehdi Ben Barka was outraged at what he called a \"pseudo-release of files\", insisting that information had been withheld which could have implicated the [[Service de Documentation Ext\u00e9rieure et de Contre-Espionnage|French secret services]] (SDECE), and possibly the CIA and the Mossad, as well as the ultimate responsibility of King Hassan II of Morocco\u2013who conveniently was able to put the blame on Oufkir after his failed coup in 1972.<ref>[http://www.lefigaro.fr/international/20060523.FIG000000128_affaire_ben_barka_driss_basri_chez_le_juge.html Affaire Ben Barka : Driss Basri chez le juge], ''[[Le Figaro]]'', 23 May 2006 {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\n===Driss Basri===\n[[Driss Basri]], Interior Minister of Hassan II and his right-hand man from the early 1980s to the late 1990s, was heard by the judge Patrick Rama\u00ebl in May 2006, as a witness, concerning Ben Barka's kidnapping.

In September, 1965 the King had allowed the Mossad to install electronic eavesdropping devices in \"all the meeting rooms and private suites of the leaders of the Arab states and their military commanders during an Arab summit in Casablanca\", giving Israel \"an unprecedented glimpse\" of the military and intelligence secrets of its greatest enemies, and of the mindsets of those countries' leaders. Information transferred to Israel from the Casablanca summit about the shaky state of the Arab armies was \"one of the foundations for the confidence felt by IDF chiefs\" when they recommended their government to wage war two years later (the 1967 [[Six-Day War]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4639608,00.html|title=The ghosts of Saint-Germain forest|date=2015-03-23|website=Ynetnews|language=en|access-date=2019-03-31}}</ref> But just one day after the Mossad had received the transcripts from this Arab summit, a top Moroccan intelligence service chief, [[Ahmed Dlimi]] requested - on behalf of King Hassan II - that the Israelis immediately repay the favor by assassinating Ben Barka.  According to Bergman's sources, the Mossad did not actually carry out the killing but played a key role in locating Barka and giving that information to Moroccan authorities so they could place him under surveillance; the Mossad created the plan for the kidnapping - which was to be carried out by the Moroccans themselves.  \"The Mossad supplied the Moroccans with safe houses in Paris, vehicles, fake passports, and two different kinds of poison with which to kill [Barka], as well as shovels and 'something to disguise the traces'\".  After the Moroccans, \"with the help of corrupt French police officers\" tortured and murdered Barka in a Mossad safe house, a team of Mossad operatives took care of the disposal of the body, burying it in the [[Saint-Germain forest]] outside Paris, carefully scattering a chemical powder over the grave which would dissolve the body.  \"[A]ccording to some of the Israelis involved\" what was left of Barka's body was then moved again and buried either under the road leading to or under the headquarters of the [[Louis Vuitton Foundation]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Bergman |first=Ronen |date=2018 |title=Rise And Kill First: The Secret History of Israel's Targeted Assassinations |url=http://www.randomhousebooks.com/books/209254/ |location= |publisher=Random House |pages=86\u201394 |isbn=978-1-4000-6971-2 |author-link=www.ronenbergman.com}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nVictoria Brittain, writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', called Ben Barka a \"revolutionary theoretician as significant as [[Frantz Fanon]] and [[Che Guevara]]\", whose \"influence reverberated far beyond their own continent\".<ref name = \"Drenched\">[https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/jan/17/lumumba-50th-anniversary-african-leaders-assassinations Africa: A Continent Drenched in the Blood of Revolutionary Heroes] by Victoria Brittain, ''[[The Guardian]]'', January 17, 2011</ref> His writings have been collected and translated in French by his son Bachir Ben Barka and published in 1999 under the title ''\u00c9crits politiques (1957\u20131965)''.<ref>Mehdi Ben Barka, ''\u00c9crits politiques (1957\u20131965)'', Syllepse, 1999, {{ISBN|2907993933}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[France-Morocco relations]]\n*[[List of solved missing persons cases]]\n*[[Maxim Ghilan]]\n\n==Filmography==\n* ''[[I Saw Ben Barka Get Killed]]'' (2005) by {{ill|Serge Le P\u00e9ron|fr}}\n* ''Ben Barka \u2013 The Moroccan Equation'' (2002) by [[Simone Bitton]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frif.com/new2003/ben.html|title=Web Page Under Construction|website=www.frif.com}}</ref>\n* ''[[Plot (film)|Plot]]'' (1972) by [[Yves Boisset]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|50em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Ben Barka\n  | first = Mehdi\n  | authorlink = Mehdi Ben Barka\n  | title = \u00c9crits politiques\n  | publisher = Syllepse\n  | date = 1957\u20131965\n  | isbn = 2-907993-93-3 |language=fr}}\n* [[Ali Bourequat]] (1998), ''In the Moroccan King's Secret Gardens'', Maurice Publishers\n* ''L'indic et le commissaire'' [[Lucien Aim\u00e9-Blanc]] and [[Jean-Michel Caradec'h]].

{"title_page": "That's Too Much, Man! (BoJack Horseman)", "text_new": "==Plot==\n\nSarah Lynn is shown to have a more calm and positive life ever since veering down the path of sobriety. She is about to hit her nine-month sober milestone and get her nine-month chip when BoJack calls her and asks her if she wants to party. She immediately accepts and downs a bottle of vodka. With the abundance of drugs and alcohol, they then proceed to drink and do drugs, as they reminisce and watch old episodes of Horsin' Around. However, BoJack begins to experience blackouts. After a few blackouts, in which Sarah Lynn asks to go to the planetarium twice, only for BoJack to reject the idea. They end up at an AA meeting because Sarah Lynn wants to get her nine-month sobriety chip. He has another blackout and comes to driving a car recklessly. Sarah Lynn tells him that he shut down the AA meeting, because he bummed everyone out.\n\nSarah Lynn also tells him, to try the twelve-step program, and to make amends to make himself feel better and get a clean slate. BoJack decides to go around and make amends to people. His first stop is Diane Nguyen and Mr. Peanutbutter's house. They break in and raid their fridge while waiting for them to come home. While they're doing this, the real Diane and Mr. Peanutbutter get home. They offer to let the two of them sleep it off in their guest bedroom but in their high state, BoJack and Sarah Lynn then run off. As they do, they shove into Diane and break her wrist again. BoJack then tries to make amends to Todd, although he ends up mistakenly apologizing to a little boy, who resembles Todd.\n\nBoJack next visits Ana Spanakopita. He asks her why she left and why she won't give them a chance to be broken together. She begins to tell him a story about why they can't work as a couple, but BoJack has another blackout. He makes Sarah Lynn drive back two more times, so that he can hear the story again, but continues to blackout. Finally, he goes to Princess Carolyn's apartment building, and tries to make amends by standing outside her apartment building on the roof of his car and screaming that he's sorry. Princess Carolyn just sighs and goes back inside with her boyfriend Ralph Stilton. BoJack returns to Ana's once again to hear her story. He apologizes for bothering her so much that night, and Ana informs him she hasn't seen him in two weeks.\n\nShe tells him her lifeguard story again\u2014after her near-death experiences a teen, where she drives her car into a lake and almost drowned. She became a lifeguard so that she would never be weaker than water. On her first day of training, her instructor told her that there will be times she will see someone in trouble, and she'll want to rush in and do anything she can to help them\u2014but she must stop herself because there are people you can't save. Those people will thrash and struggle, and try to take you down with them. BoJack doesn't get what that whole story has to do with him.\n\nBoJack has another blackout, and wakes up in the car, driving to Ohio to make amends with Penny; and to see if he messed up her life. He demands Sarah Lynn to turn the car around, but they end up at her school library. They spot Penny using the computer and BoJack says that they should stop following her, although he blacks out again and it's now later at night, outside of a party Penny is attending. BoJack says that she seems fine and that maybe he didn't ruin her. He agrees to leave after he urinates but ends up bumping into a group of guys, thus alerting Penny. She begins to freak out and tells him that he can't be here, she then says \"I was seventeen, I didn\u2019t know any better!\" The people around them start to recognize Sarah Lynn and BoJack and begin to take pictures of them, so they leave as a frightened Penny disappears into the crowd.\n\nBack in the car, Sarah Lynn tells BoJack that Penny was probably doing great before they showed up and that they should've just left her alone; to BoJack's chagrin. On the car ride home, Sarah Lynn finds a pack of heroin nicknamed \"BoJack\" in Bojack's glove compartment. She tells BoJack that they should try it, with the caveat that having a drug named after you is a big deal. He says he doesn't want to shoot heroin. Later, after the two have returned to Sarah Lynn's house, BoJack says him and Sarah Lynn are gonna snort heroin, like sophisticated adults. After he snorts some heroin, BoJack blacks out again. During his blackout, he has a flashback to Thanksgiving 2007, at Cuddlywhiskers's house. Everything in the background is shaking around them. Cuddlywhiskers gets off the phone with the network executives, and they had told him the latest episode of The BoJack Horseman Show, had gotten the lowest ratings yet. He tells BoJack he still believes their show has an audience, and they should try to get a guest star to boost ratings, presumably Sarah Lynn. BoJack is uneasy about this, as she's \u201cthe world's biggest pop star\" and they hadn't spoken since Horsin\u2019 Around ended.\n\nBoJack wakes up. He then has a series of blackouts that transition him and Sarah Lynn to different locations. While this happens, he reminisces on their time together on Horsin' Around, and tells Sarah Lynn he feels like she's the only one who understands him. He elaborates, saying they can be friends because they're the only two people who knew each other before they were famous, and they like each other for who they really are. BoJack continues this speech, as the scene transitions, to the two of them laying on a bed in a hotel. BoJack says they don't want anything from each other, and he tells Sarah Lynn he loves her. She doesn't respond, and he panics, but she is apathetic about this and complains about being bored.\n\nShe turns on the TV and discovers the Oscars are on, to BoJack's surprise as he discovers how long they were actually on the bender. Sarah Lynn states she loves the glitz and glam of the Oscars. Sarah Lynn wins the Oscar for Best Original Song in absentia, which makes her ecstatic, but then regretful as she wasn't there to receive it. She tells BoJack if someone had told her as a kid she'd win an Oscar, she wouldn't have believed it, but now she has, and she cuts herself off. Sarah Lynn tells BoJack she doesn't like anything about herself. She says even her shirt came from a company who paid her $8,000 to wear it, despite her not needing the money, she just likes that someone still cared about her enough to want her to wear their shirt. BoJack tries to comfort her, but Sarah Lynn begins to panic, thinking she and everyone else is doomed. BoJack calms her down and finally agrees to take her to the planetarium.\n\nThe two are then in the planetarium watching a show. Sarah Lynn rests her head on BoJack's shoulder and says \"I wanna be an architect.\" The narrator says, their lives are but short flashes in a universe, that is billions of years old. BoJack tells Sarah Lynn there's nothing to worry about because it doesn't matter what you did in the past or how you'll be remembered, all that matter is this precious moment that they are sharing together. He asks if she agrees, but she doesn't respond. He nudges her and says her name multiple times, but Sarah Lynn doesn't respond, Signaling that she died.\n\n==References==\n\n\nEttenhofer, Valerie. \u201c'That's Too Much, Man!'
