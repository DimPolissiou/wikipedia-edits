He was a composer, pianist, conductor and teacher. After an early career as a performer and composer, he was an early member of the staff of the [[Royal Academy of Music]] in London, and became its principal in 1832, remaining in the post until 1859.\n\n==Life and career==\n===Early years===\nPotter was born in London to a musical family. He was the third son of the seven children of Richard Huddleston Potter (1755\u20131821), a flautist, violinist, and teacher, and his wife, Charlotte, ''n\u00e9e'' Baumgarten (1757\u20131837).

He began to fly in 1909, using an 8-cylinder 40 horsepower ENV 'D' engine and building the airframe in his studio; he rented a shed on Back Common Road, [[Turnham Green]] near his home to assemble the aircraft, which was a biplane with elevator in front of the wing, and a [[variable-pitch propeller]].<ref name=\"Manton 2006\"/> From September 1909 he tested the aircraft on a rented field in Ealing to the west of Masons Lane at what was then Hangar Hill Farm (not the same as the later Acton Aerodrome, which was on the other side of Masons Lane).<ref name=\"Manton 2006\"/><ref>Map and discussion of probable site: {{cite web |title=NORTH EALING: Private flying field |url=http://www.ukairfieldguide.net/airfields/North-Ealing |publisher=UK Airfield Guide |accessdate=9 November 2019}}</ref> He managed to get the plane airborne and fly \"a foot or two from the ground for a distance of a hundred yards or so.\"<ref name=\"Manton 2006\"/> However, on 3 December 1909 the aircraft and its marquee hangar were destroyed in a storm.<ref name=\"Manton 2006\"/>\n\n===Flying at Shoreham===\n[[File:Harold_Piffard's_Hummingbird_Biplane_at_Shoreham_1910.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.75|Piffard in his hand-built aircraft ''Hummingbird'' on the [[Shoreham-by-Sea|Shoreham]] field where he flew it, 1910<ref name=\"Manton 2006\"/>]]\n\nPiffard then co-founded (with George Wingfield, a lawyer) the Aviator's Finance Company, which took out a lease on land at [[Shoreham-by-Sea]] near his old school, [[Lancing College]], which already possessed a hangar. With Edouard Baumann and two assistants, they reworked the aircraft's design and had ''Hummingbird'' ready on 3 May 1910. It was able to take off in short hops, earning it the nickname of \"The Grasshopper\"; it frequently crashed because of the hidden ditches in the grass. In September 1910 he flew at a height of 30 or 40 feet for half a mile, managing to fly right across the field to a nearby hotel, The Sussex Pad \"in about 40 seconds\". He had not learnt how to turn the plane in the air, and the plane had to be wheeled back to the hangar, as there was no space to take off near the hotel, but he celebrated with champagne all the same.<ref name=\"Manton 2006\"/>{{cite web |title=The Clarion : Armistice Centenary Edition |url=http://www.smaaa.org.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Clarion-Armistice-Centenary-Edition-1918-2018.pdf |publisher=St Michael's and All Angels, Bedford Park |page=10 |date=2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Gage |first1=Bill (asst. county archivist) |title=Pioneer aviators helped develop Shoreham airfield |url=https://www.shorehamherald.co.uk/lifestyle/pioneer-aviators-helped-develop-shoreham-airfield-1-6690835 |date=17 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nA local cinematograph company asked to film a flight, and he confidently accepted; Colin Manton describes this as characteristic [[hubris]].<ref name=\"Manton 2006\"/> Ignoring warnings of a dangerous ditch, he tried to fly over it, destroying the aircraft in a \"comprehensive smash\" which was recorded on film.<ref name=\"Manton 2006\"/> The cameraman noted that Piffard still \"seemed in no way disappointed; in fact, I thought I saw a gleam of satisfaction in his eye\".<ref name=\"Manton 2006\"/>\n\nIn 1911 Piffard unsuccessfully tested a new aircraft, the ''Piffard Hydroplane'', which had floats as well as wheels, on Shoreham beach.

He began to fly in 1909, using an 8-cylinder 40 horsepower ENV 'D' engine and building the airframe in his studio; he rented a shed on Back Common Road, [[Turnham Green]] near his home to assemble the aircraft, which was a biplane with elevator in front of the wing, and a [[variable-pitch propeller]].<ref name=\"Manton 2006\"/> From September 1909 he tested the aircraft on a rented field in Ealing to the west of Masons Lane at what was then Hangar Hill Farm (not the same as the later Acton Aerodrome, which was on the other side of Masons Lane).<ref name=\"Manton 2006\"/><ref>Map and discussion of probable site: {{cite web |title=NORTH EALING: Private flying field |url=http://www.ukairfieldguide.net/airfields/North-Ealing |publisher=UK Airfield Guide |accessdate=9 November 2019}}</ref> He managed to get the plane airborne and fly \"a foot or two from the ground for a distance of a hundred yards or so.\"<ref name=\"Manton 2006\"/> However, on 3 December 1909 the aircraft and its marquee hangar were destroyed in a storm.<ref name=\"Manton 2006\"/>\n\n===Flying at Shoreham===\n[[File:Harold_Piffard's_Hummingbird_Biplane_at_Shoreham_1910.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.75|Piffard in his hand-built aircraft ''Hummingbird'' on the [[Shoreham-by-Sea|Shoreham]] field where he flew it, 1910<ref name=\"Manton 2006\"/>]]\n\nPiffard then co-founded (with George Wingfield, a lawyer) the Aviator's Finance Company, which took out a lease on land at [[Shoreham-by-Sea]] near his old school, [[Lancing College]], which already possessed a hangar. With Edouard Baumann and two assistants, they reworked the aircraft's design and had ''Hummingbird'' ready on 3 May 1910. It was able to take off in short hops, earning it the nickname of \"The Grasshopper\"; it frequently crashed because of the hidden ditches in the grass. In September 1910 he flew at a height of 30 or 40 feet for half a mile, managing to fly right across the field to a nearby hotel, The Sussex Pad \"in about 40 seconds\". He had not learnt how to turn the plane in the air, and the plane had to be wheeled back to the hangar, as there was no space to take off near the hotel, but he celebrated with champagne all the same.<ref name=\"Manton 2006\"/>{{cite web |title=The Clarion : Armistice Centenary Edition |url=http://www.smaaa.org.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Clarion-Armistice-Centenary-Edition-1918-2018.pdf |publisher=St Michael's and All Angels, Bedford Park |page=10 |date=2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Gage |first1=Bill (asst. county archivist) |title=Pioneer aviators helped develop Shoreham airfield |url=https://www.shorehamherald.co.uk/lifestyle/pioneer-aviators-helped-develop-shoreham-airfield-1-6690835 |date=17 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nA local cinematograph company asked to film a flight, and he confidently accepted; Colin Manton describes this as characteristic [[hubris]].<ref name=\"Manton 2006\"/> Ignoring warnings of a dangerous ditch, he tried to fly over it, destroying the aircraft in a \"comprehensive smash\" which was recorded on film.<ref name=\"Manton 2006\"/> The cameraman noted that Piffard still \"seemed in no way disappointed; in fact, I thought I saw a gleam of satisfaction in his eye\".<ref name=\"Manton 2006\"/>\n\nIn 1911 Piffard unsuccessfully tested a new aircraft, the ''Piffard Hydroplane'', which had floats as well as wheels, on Shoreham beach.

The family claimed descent from one [[Se\u00e1n M\u00f3r Seoighe]] (fl. 1680), a stonemason from [[Connemara]], [[County Galway]]. \n\n[[Robert Dwyer Joyce]] was a younger brother. Joyce was a native Irish speaker who started his education at a [[hedge school]]. He then attended school in [[Mitchelstown]], County Cork.\n\nJoyce started work in 1845 with the Commission of National Education. He became a teacher and principal of the Model School, [[Clonmel]]. In 1856 he was one of fifteen teachers selected to re-organize the national school system in Ireland. Meanwhile he earned his B.A. in 1861 and M.A. in 1863 from [[Trinity College Dublin|Trinity College]], [[Dublin]].<ref name=boy>{{cite book|last=Boylan|first= Henry |year=1998|title=A Dictionary of Irish Biography, 3rd Edition|page=198|location=Dublin|publisher= Gill and MacMillan|ISBN = 0-7171-2945-4}}</ref>\n\nHe was principal of the Training College, Marlborough Street, in [[Dublin]] from 1874 to 1893.

The family claimed descent from one [[Se\u00e1n M\u00f3r Seoighe]] (fl. 1680), a stonemason from [[Connemara]], [[County Galway]]. \n\n[[Robert Dwyer Joyce]] was a younger brother. Joyce was a native Irish speaker who started his education at a [[hedge school]]. He then attended school in [[Mitchelstown]], County Cork.\n\nJoyce started work in 1845 with the Commission of National Education. He became a teacher and principal of the Model School, [[Clonmel]]. In 1856 he was one of fifteen teachers selected to re-organize the national school system in Ireland.
