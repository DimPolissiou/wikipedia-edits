The console offered various hardware improvements and additional functions over previous Nintendo DS iterations, such as the inclusion of cameras. While many Nintendo DS titles released afterwards included features that enhanced gameplay when played on the Nintendo DSi console, most of these games retained compatibility with the original DS iterations sans enhanced features. However, a select few retail game titles were released that worked exclusively for the Nintendo DSi consoles for reasons such as requiring camera functions, and these titles have game cards with white-colored casings (all DSi-exclusive games are region locked). Examples of such game cards include ''[[Picture Perfect Hair Salon]]''. While these white game cards can be physically inserted into original Nintendo DS consoles, their software did not function due to the missing hardware features. These DSi-exclusive game cards are fully compatible with the Nintendo 3DS family.\n\nPrior to the release of the Nintendo DSi, Nintendo encouraged developers to release DSi-exclusive games as [[DSiWare]] downloadables instead of retail game cards that would not function on older Nintendo DS consoles.<ref name=\"Harris2009b\">{{cite web|url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/966/966301p1.html|title=GDC 09: DSi Hybrid, Exclusive Carts Soon|accessdate=23 June 2010|date=25 March 2009|author=Craig Harris|work=IGN|publisher=Fox Interactive Media|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327175846/http://ds.ign.com/articles/966/966301p1.html|archivedate=27 March 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Infrared support ===\nDespite all iterations of the [[Nintendo DS line]] lacking native [[infrared]] support, certain titles made use of this type of communication function using game cards with their own infrared transceivers.

The console offered various hardware improvements and additional functions over previous Nintendo DS iterations, such as the inclusion of cameras. While many Nintendo DS titles released afterwards included features that enhanced gameplay when played on the Nintendo DSi console, most of these games retained compatibility with the original DS iterations sans enhanced features. However, a select few retail game titles were released that worked exclusively for the Nintendo DSi consoles for reasons such as requiring camera functions, and these titles have game cards with white-colored casings (all DSi-exclusive games are region locked). Examples of such game cards include ''[[Picture Perfect Hair Salon]]''. While these white game cards can be physically inserted into original Nintendo DS consoles, their software did not function due to the missing hardware features. These DSi-exclusive game cards are fully compatible with the Nintendo 3DS family.\n\nPrior to the release of the Nintendo DSi, Nintendo encouraged developers to release DSi-exclusive games as [[DSiWare]] downloadables instead of retail game cards that would not function on older Nintendo DS consoles.<ref name=\"Harris2009b\">{{cite web|url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/966/966301p1.html|title=GDC 09: DSi Hybrid, Exclusive Carts Soon|accessdate=23 June 2010|date=25 March 2009|author=Craig Harris|work=IGN|publisher=Fox Interactive Media|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327175846/http://ds.ign.com/articles/966/966301p1.html|archivedate=27 March 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Infrared support ===\nDespite all iterations of the [[Nintendo DS line]] lacking native [[infrared]] support, certain titles made use of this type of communication function using game cards with their own infrared transceivers.

The song topped the Canadian ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' Top Singles chart for two weeks and the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Adult Top 40|Adult Pop Songs]] chart for ten weeks; it was not allowed to chart on the ''Billboard'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] at the time due to not receiving a physical release in the United States.

A [[supermarket]] is also shown. The video switches between color video clips and black-and-white still images. During the introduction and the third verse of the song, Thomas walks in the middle of the street with some construction signs and lights. During the third verse, a [[Pontiac Trans Am]] with a bare-chested man and a woman inside stops in front of Thomas. The man gets out, revealing a [[central venous catheter|catheter in his chest]], receives three cigarettes from Thomas and then gets back in the Trans Am. Finally, during the last two choruses, the band is shown playing their instruments (presumably in the lobby of a hotel or office building) as rain can be seen falling from a large window behind them.

Introduced to Athens in the 1950s by immigrants from Turkey and the Middle East, gyros was originally known simply as ''d\u00f6ner kebab''. It is typically served as a sandwich rolled in [[pita]] bread, or on a plate, with french fries and various salads and sauces such as [[tzatziki]]. Later in the 1960s, vendors also began selling dishes in the same style made with souvlaki, which resembles Turkish shish kebab, but is usually made with pork.<ref name=\"Street Foods\">\n{{cite book\n| title=Street Foods\n| author1-last=Matalas | author1-first=Antonia-Leda\n| author2-last=Yannakoulia | author2-first=Mary\n| editor1-last=Simopoulos | editor1-first=Artemis P.\n| editorlink1=Artemis Simopoulos\n| editor2-last=Bhat | editor2-first=Ramesh Venkataramana\n| chapter=Greek Street Food Vending: An Old Habit Turned New\n| chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QQgwVl22fXkC&pg=PA6\n| year=2000\n| publisher=Karger Medical and Scientific Publishers\n| isbn=978-3-8055-6927-9\n| pages=6\n}}\n</ref>\n\nAround the same time, the Greek word ''gyros'' replaced ''d\u00f6ner kebab'', and the Greek style of the dish spread to become popular, particularly in North America, and various other parts of the world.<ref name=\"The Food Timeline: history notes--sandwiches\">\n{{cite news\n| url=http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodsandwiches.html#gyros\n| title=The Gyro, a Greek Sandwich, Selling Like Hot Dogs\n| date=September 4, 1971\n| newspaper=The New York Times\n| pages=23\n| accessdate=February 22, 2016\n}}\n</ref>\n\nIn contrast to other areas of Greece, in Athens, both types of sandwich may be called ''souvlaki'', with the skewered meat being called ''kalamaki''.\n\nAlthough gyros is unquestionably of Middle Eastern origin, the issue of whether modern-day souvlaki came to Greece via Turkish cuisine, and should be considered a Greek styling of shish kebab, or is a contemporary revival of Greek tradition dating as far back as 17th century BC [[Minoan civilization]],<ref name=\"Greece Is\">\n{{cite web\n| url=http://www.greece-is.com/prehistoric-gastronomy-2/\n| title=Prehistoric Gastronomy\n| author=Tassoula Eptakili\n| date=2015-10-09\n| website=Greece Is\n| accessdate=February 21, 2016\n}}\n</ref> is a topic of sometimes heated debate, at least between Greeks and Turks.<ref name=\"David L.

It is an old northern tradition (probably originating in [[Tehran]]) that a raw egg yolk should be placed on top of the rice as well, though this is strictly optional, and most restaurants will not serve the rice this way unless it is specifically requested. \"Somagh\", powdered [[sumac]], is also made available and its use varies based on tastes to a small dash on the rice or a heavy sprinkling on both rice and meat, particularly when used with red (beef/veal/lamb) meat.\n\nAt Persian restaurants, the combination of one [[kabab barg]] and one [[kabab koobideh]] is typically called ''Soltani'', meaning \"sultan's feast\". The traditional beverage of choice to accompany kebab is [[doogh]], a sour yogurt drink with mint and salt.\n\nIn the old [[bazaar]] tradition, the rice (which is covered with a tin lid) and accompaniments are served first, immediately followed by the kebabs, which are brought to the table by the waiter, who holds several skewers in his left hand, and a piece of flat bread (typically nan-e lavash) in his right. A skewer is placed directly on the rice and while holding the kebab down on the rice with the bread, the skewer is quickly pulled out. With the two most common kebabs, [[Kabab barg|barg]] and [[Kabab koobideh|koobideh]], two skewers are always served.

The kebab is made of finely ground mince goat meat with spices and then charcoal grilled on a skewer. It is commonly served with Roomali Roti (a very thin bread), onion and a mint chutney (sauce).

They consist of small cubes of meat threaded onto a skewer ({{lang-es|pincho}}) which are traditionally cooked over [[charcoal]] braziers. Similar dishes in North Africa or other [[Muslim majority countries]] tend to be lamb-based, but pork and chicken are the most popular meats for the dish in Spain. Pinchitos are also extremely popular in Venezuela, due the heavy influence Spain had in Venezuelan cuisine during many years.\n\n===Shashlik===\n{{main|Shashlik}}\n''Shashlik'' is similar to, or sometimes a synonym for, shish kebab.

This is different from its use in the Middle East, where ''shish'' ([[Persian language|Persian]]/[[Mazanderani language|Mazandarani]]: \u0634\u06cc\u0634, {{lang-tr|\u015fi\u015f}}) is the word for skewer, while ''kebab'' comes from the word for grilling.<ref name=\"encyclopedia\" />\n\n===Doner kebab===\n[[File:Donner Kebab, Cologne, Germany (1057919169).jpg|thumb|A German-style {{lang|de|D\u00f6ner}}]]\n{{Main|Doner kebab}}\nEnglish speakers from countries outside North America may also use the word ''kebab'' generally to mean the popular [[fast food]] version of the Turkish d\u00f6ner kebab,<ref name=\"Cambridge English Dictionary\" /> or the related shawarma or gyros, and the sandwiches made with them, available from [[kebab shop]]s as take-away meals. This usage may be found in some non-English parts of Europe as well. In North America, the Greek variant gyros is most widely known.\n\nThe d\u00f6ner kebab originated in 19th century Turkey, but it became widely popular in the West only in the latter half of the 20th century. Many layers of meat are stacked onto a large vertical rotating spit; the outer surface is gradually cooked and sliced off, and typically served either mixed or topped with vegetables and sauces in a sandwich made with [[pita]] or other [[flatbreads]]. Certain regional variants also include cheeses. Sandwiches served in the same manner, but with other meats or cheese, may also sometimes be called a \"kebab\". It is available in most parts of Europe, and many other countries, though sometimes with different names or serving styles. In Germany, the highly popular sandwich, introduced by Turkish immigrants, is called a ''D\u00f6ner'', though Arab shops there serve ''shawarma''.<ref>[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/travel/destinations/2010-04-11-germany-doner-kebab_N.htm Doner kebab becomes Germany's favorite fast food], ''USAToday'', 4/11/2010</ref>\n\n==Similar dishes==\n{{main|Skewer}}\n{{col begin}}\n{{col break}}\n\n;Americas\n*[[City chicken]] (U.S.)\n*[[Spiedie]]s ([[New York State]])\n*[[Anticucho]]s ([[Andean States|Andean]])\n*Espetinho ([[Brazilian cuisine|Brazilian]])\n{{col break}}\n;Asia\n*[[Kkochi]] and [[jeok]] ([[Korean cuisine|Korean]])\n*[[Kushiyaki]] and [[kushikatsu]] ([[Japanese cuisine|Japanese]])\n{{col break}}\n;Europe, Caucasus, central Asia\n*[[Kebakko]] ([[Finnish cuisine|Finnish]])\n*[[Brochette]] ([[French cuisine|French]])\n*[[Espetada]] ([[Portuguese cuisine|Portuguese]])\n*[[Souvlaki]] (\u03a3\u03bf\u03c5\u03b2\u03bb\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9; [[Greek cuisine|Greek]])\n*[[Arrosticini]] ([[Italian cuisine|Italian]])\n{{col end}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Food}}\n{{Commons category|Kebabs}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Afghan Cuisine]]\n* [[Arab cuisine]]\n* [[Armenian cuisine]]\n* [[Azerbaijani cuisine]]\n* [[Iranian cuisine]]\n* [[Iraqi cuisine]]\n* [[Israeli cuisine]]\n* [[Levantine cuisine]]\n* [[List of barbecue dishes]]\n* [[List of kebabs]]\n* [[List of spit-roasted foods]]\n* [[Ottoman cuisine]]\n* [[Syrian cuisine]]\n* [[Turkish cuisine]]\n* [[Pakistani cuisine]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Cuisine of Turkey}}\n{{Cuisine of Iran}}\n{{African cuisine}}\n{{Cuisine of the Levant}}\n{{Barbecue}}\n{{Meat|state=expanded}}\n{{Street food}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2011}}\n\n[[Category:Kebabs| ]]\n[[Category:Herb and spice mixtures]]\n[[Category:Skewered foods]]\n[[Category:Spit-cooked foods]]\n[[Category:Street food]]\n[[Category:Ancient dishes]]\n[[Category:Afghan cuisine]]\n[[Category:Arab cuisine]]\n[[Category:Palestinian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Lebanese cuisine]]\n[[Category:Armenian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Assyrian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Australian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Azerbaijani cuisine]]\n[[Category:Bengali cuisine]]\n[[Category:Balkan cuisine]]\n[[Category:Iranian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Iraqi cuisine]]\n[[Category:Israeli cuisine]]\n[[Category:Jordanian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Kurdish cuisine]]\n[[Category:Levantine cuisine]]\n[[Category:Pakistani cuisine]]\n[[Category:Middle Eastern grilled meats]]\n[[Category:Omani cuisine]]\n[[Category:Ottoman cuisine]]\n[[Category:South Asian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Syrian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Types of food]]\n[[Category:Food Watchlist Articles]]\n", "name_user": "Msquared5991", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Misleading info)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kebab"}
