Records''' is an American [[jazz]] record company and [[record label|label]] established by [[Creed Taylor]] in 1960. [[John Coltrane]] was among Impulse!'s earliest signings. Thanks to consistent sales and positive critiques of his recordings, the label came to be known as \"the house that Trane built\".<ref>Ashley Kahn (2006) ''The House That Trane Built: The Story of Impulse Records'', W.W. Norton, {{ISBN|0-393-05879-4}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nImpulse!'s parent company, [[ABC-Paramount Records]], was established in 1955 as the recording division of the American Broadcasting Company ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]). In the 1940s and 1950s, ABC benefitted from the U.S. government's [[antitrust]] actions against broadcasters and film studios who were forced to divest parts of their companies. In the early 1950s, ABC acquired the [[Blue Network]] of radio stations from [[NBC]] and later merged with the newly independent Paramount Theaters chain, formerly owned by [[Paramount Pictures]].\n\nThe new recording division was located at [[1501 Broadway]], above the [[Paramount Theatre (New York City)|Paramount Theatre]] in [[Times Square]].<ref>Kahn, 2006, p.15-16</ref> Under the leadership of [[Leonard Goldenson]], the former head of Paramount Pictures, the company \"sought to establish itself as a cross-media force in television, theaters and sound recordings\".<ref>Kahn, p.&nbsp;16</ref> It enjoyed early success in TV with ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]'', a joint venture with the [[Disney]] corporation.\n\nTo market music from the successful TV show, ABC-Paramount established the Am-Par Record Corporation and the ABC-Paramount label in early 1955, appointing Sam Clark, a Boston record distributor, as president, with Larry Newton as sales manager and Harry Levine the A&R director. The new recording company enjoyed Goldenson's full support. Sid Feller, a producer and arranger, was the first salaried employee on July 15, 1955.<ref>Kahn, 2006, p.16</ref> The label achieved early success in [[pop music]] with [[Paul Anka]].\n\nIn 1960 Am-Par established a jazz subsidiary and hired [[Creed Taylor]], a producer and arranger who had worked with [[Bethlehem Records]]. Taylor became producer and A&R manager. He chose the name \"Pulse\" but then learned there was already a label with that name, so he added a prefix. In the mid-60s, Impulse!'s headquarters were moved to 1130 [[Avenue of the Americas]].<ref>Original liner notes to ''[[The October Suite]]''</ref>\n\n===Design===\nImpulse!'s albums are noted for their visual appeal. The black, orange, and white [[livery]] was devised by [[Fran Attaway]] (then known as Fran Scott), whom Taylor also credits with establishing the label's tradition of using cutting-edge photographers for its covers.<ref>[http://www.birkajazz.com/archive/impulse.htm Birka Jazz - Impulse jazz album covers]</ref> The color scheme was chosen for its brightness and because no other label used this combination.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://jazztimes.com/features/the-impulse-records-story-the-house-that-trane-built/|title=The Impulse Records Story: The House That Trane Built - JazzTimes|work=JazzTimes|access-date=2017-09-07|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe label's logo featured the Impulse! name in a heavy, sans-serif, lower-cased font, followed by an exclamation mark that mirrors the lower-case \"i\" at the beginning. For most of the 1960s, Impulse!'s album covers featured the logo in orange letters in a white circle, with black-and-orange exclamation marks above it, and the catalog number below it. One exception is the album ''[[A Love Supreme]]'', which used the design in black and white. In 1968 the circular front-cover badge was replaced by a one-color design featuring a simplified Impulse! logo and the ABC Records logo side by side within a divided rectangular border.\n\nAlbum covers often featured stylish, large-format photographs or paintings, usually in color, which were typically 'bled out' to the edges of the cover and printed on glossy laminated stock. Many of the best-known Impulse! covers were designed by art director [[Robert Flynn (graphic designer)|Robert Flynn]] and photographed by a small group that included [[Pete Turner (photographer)|Pete Turner]], who shot covers for Verve, [[A&M Records|A&M]], and [[CTI Records|CTI]]; [[Chuck Stewart]], [[Arnold Newman]], [[Ted Russell (photographer)|Ted Russell]], and [https://web.archive.org/web/20090323120015/http://www.bobdylanphotobook.com/ Joe Alper], who was known for his early '60s photographs of [[Bob Dylan]]) The sparse black-and-white back covers bore the slogan, \"The New Wave of Jazz is on IMPULSE!\". Most Impulse! LPs were issued in a gatefold sleeve, with photographs and liner notes, in some cases, multi-page booklets.\n\n===Early success===\nTaylor achieved early success by signing [[Ray Charles]], who had just ended his contract with [[Atlantic Records]]. Charles's ''[[Genius + Soul = Jazz]]'' gave the label its first hit and became the fourth-highest charting album of his career.<ref>Kahn, 2006, p.35</ref> Other early successes included ''[[Out of the Cool]]'' by [[Gil Evans]]. Taylor also signed [[John Coltrane]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-house-that-trane-built-the-story-of-impulse-records-mw0001996707|title=The House That Trane Built: The Story of Impulse Records - Various Artists {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2017-09-07}}</ref>\n\nAnother significant early release was ''[[The Blues and the Abstract Truth]]'' by [[Oliver Nelson]], who led an all-star group that featured [[Freddie Hubbard]], [[Eric Dolphy]], [[Bill Evans]], [[Paul Chambers]], and [[Roy Haynes]]. Nelson played an important role in the label's early years before relocating to Los Angeles, where he became an arranger for film and television.\n\nTaylor left Impulse! in the summer of 1961 after being approached by MGM to become the head of [[Verve Records]].\n\n===The Thiele Years: 1961-69===\n[[Bob Thiele]], Taylor's successor, produced most of the albums in the 1960s. He had worked for [[Decca Records]] and its subsidiaries, [[Coral Records|Coral]] and [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick]], where his production credits included [[Alan Dale]], [[The McGuire Sisters]], [[Pearl Bailey]], and [[Theresa Brewer]], whom he married. Despite resistance from Decca executives who were suspicious of rock and roll, Thiele signed [[Buddy Holly]] in 1957.<ref>Kahn, 2006, p.63</ref>\n\nThiele's first Impulse! production was Coltrane's ''[[Live! at the Village Vanguard]]'', released in March 1962. Although unfamiliar with the \"new jazz\" movement, Thiele backed his artists, afforded them unprecedented freedom in their repertoire, and gave leading acts like Coltrane ''[[blank cheque|carte blanche]]'' in the studio. Impulse! during the Thiele years is recognized as a key outlet for [[free jazz]] and the musical movement spearheaded by Coltrane, [[Freddie Hubbard]], [[Archie Shepp]], and [[McCoy Tyner]]. In addition to avant-garde releases, Thiele also produced collaborations between Coltrane and two of their mutual heroes, [[Duke Ellington]] and [[Coleman Hawkins]]. Other notable performers who recorded for Impulse! during this period included [[Charles Mingus]].\n\nAided by good promotion and ABC-Paramount's well-established distribution chain, Coltrane enjoyed the highest profile and the strongest and most consistent sales of any Impulse! artist. In addition to its artistic influence, Coltrane's 1965 LP ''[[A Love Supreme]]'' became one of the most successful jazz albums ever released, selling over 100,000 copies<ref>Kahn, 2006, p.5</ref> on its first release. By 1970 it had sold more than half a million. [[Roger McGuinn]] of [[The Byrds]] has stated that he listened to Coltrane extensively in this period, and that Coltrane's saxophone playing influenced his 12-string guitar playing on the hit \"[[Eight Miles High]]\".\n\nThiele severed his ties with Impulse! in 1969, setting up a short-lived deal to provide independently-produced recordings, before leaving the label entirely to establish his own imprint, [[Flying Dutchman Records]]. Thiele's departure was in part precipitated by the breakdown of his relationship with [[Larry Newton]], the president of ABC Records.\n\nOne of Thiele's last productions was the Louis Armstrong song \"[[What A Wonderful World]]\", which Thiele co-wrote and produced for ABC's pop division shortly before Armstrong's death. Although the musicians were apparently unaware of the drama, the recording session is reported to have been the scene of a clash between Thiele and Newton. When Newton arrived at the session he became upset when he discovered that Armstrong was recording a ballad rather than a '[[Dixieland]]'-style number like his earlier hit \"[[Hello, Dolly! (song)|Hello Dolly]]\". According to Thiele's own account, this led to a screaming match; Newton then had to be locked out of the studio and he stood outside throughout the session, banging on the door and yelling to be let in. The single was released with little promotion from ABC and it sold relatively poorly in the U.S.. In Europe, it sold more than 1.5 million copies and went to #1 in the UK. Demand from ABC's European distributor [[EMI]] for an album forced ABC to issue one, but they did not promote the album and it did not chart in the U.S. Twenty years later, it became the most successful recording of both Armstrong's and Thiele's careers, thanks to its inclusion on the soundtrack ''[[Good Morning, Vietnam]]''.\n\n===The 1970s===\nUnder the guidance of [[Ed Michel]], Thiele's successor, Impulse! continued to issue notable recordings, including the debut album by the [[Liberation Music Orchestra]], the first of four acclaimed collaborations between [[Charlie Haden]] and [[Carla Bley]]. The company also acquired LPs that [[Sun Ra]] had recorded for his private label, making them more widely available for the first time.\n\nIn the early 1970s ABC restructured its recording division, merging the ABC label with its other pop-rock subsidiary, [[Dunhill Records]], whose roster included [[The Mamas & the Papas]], [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]], [[Three Dog Night]], and [[Steely Dan]]. Impulse! was moved to share headquarters with ABC-Dunhill in [[Los Angeles]]. By this time pop-rock acts dominated the company's output, with Impulse! releases accounting for only 5 percent of total sales. It was also during this time that Impulse! became the first all-jazz label to release a rock album when it issued ''[[Trespass (album)|Trespass]]'', the second album by [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], in the U.S. in 1970.\n\nIn 1974, ABC acquired the [[Famous Music]] labels and catalog from [[Gulf+Western]], and subsequently, that company's jazz recordings were incorporated into the Impulse! catalog. New recordings from the label ceased in the late 1970s, but ABC reissued titles until the company was sold to [[MCA Records]] in 1979. It is now part of [[Universal Music Group]]'s jazz holdings, [[Verve Records|The Verve Music Group]].\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Impulse!

In the 1940s and 1950s, ABC benefitted from the U.S. government's [[antitrust]] actions against broadcasters and film studios who were forced to divest parts of their companies. In the early 1950s, ABC acquired the [[Blue Network]] of radio stations from [[NBC]] and later merged with the newly independent Paramount Theaters chain, formerly owned by [[Paramount Pictures]].\n\nThe new recording division was located at [[1501 Broadway]], above the [[Paramount Theatre (New York City)|Paramount Theatre]] in [[Times Square]].<ref>Kahn, 2006, p.15-16</ref> Under the leadership of [[Leonard Goldenson]], the former head of Paramount Pictures, the company \"sought to establish itself as a cross-media force in television, theaters and sound recordings\".<ref>Kahn, p.&nbsp;16</ref> It enjoyed early success in TV with ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]'', a joint venture with the [[Disney]] corporation.\n\nTo market music from the successful TV show, ABC-Paramount established the Am-Par Record Corporation and the ABC-Paramount label in early 1955, appointing Sam Clark, a Boston record distributor, as president, with Larry Newton as sales manager and Harry Levine the A&R director. The new recording company enjoyed Goldenson's full support. Sid Feller, a producer and arranger, was the first salaried employee on July 15, 1955.<ref>Kahn, 2006, p.16</ref> The label achieved early success in [[pop music]] with [[Paul Anka]].\n\nIn 1960 Am-Par established a jazz subsidiary and hired [[Creed Taylor]], a producer and arranger who had worked with [[Bethlehem Records]]. Taylor became producer and A&R manager. He chose the name \"Pulse\" but then learned there was already a label with that name, so he added a prefix. In the mid-60s, Impulse!'s headquarters were moved to 1130 [[Avenue of the Americas]].<ref>Original liner notes to ''[[The October Suite]]''</ref>\n\n===Design===\nImpulse!'s albums are noted for their visual appeal. The black, orange, and white [[livery]] was devised by [[Fran Attaway]] (then known as Fran Scott), whom Taylor also credits with establishing the label's tradition of using cutting-edge photographers for its covers.<ref>[http://www.birkajazz.com/archive/impulse.htm Birka Jazz - Impulse jazz album covers]</ref> The color scheme was chosen for its brightness and because no other label used this combination.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://jazztimes.com/features/the-impulse-records-story-the-house-that-trane-built/|title=The Impulse Records Story: The House That Trane Built - JazzTimes|work=JazzTimes|access-date=2017-09-07|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe label's logo featured the Impulse! name in a heavy, sans-serif, lower-cased font, followed by an exclamation mark that mirrors the lower-case \"i\" at the beginning. For most of the 1960s, Impulse!'s album covers featured the logo in orange letters in a white circle, with black-and-orange exclamation marks above it, and the catalog number below it. One exception is the album ''[[A Love Supreme]]'', which used the design in black and white. In 1968 the circular front-cover badge was replaced by a one-color design featuring a simplified Impulse! logo and the ABC Records logo side by side within a divided rectangular border.\n\nAlbum covers often featured stylish, large-format photographs or paintings, usually in color, which were typically 'bled out' to the edges of the cover and printed on glossy laminated stock. Many of the best-known Impulse! covers were designed by art director [[Robert Flynn (graphic designer)|Robert Flynn]] and photographed by a small group that included [[Pete Turner (photographer)|Pete Turner]], who shot covers for Verve, [[A&M Records|A&M]], and [[CTI Records|CTI]]; [[Chuck Stewart]], [[Arnold Newman]], [[Ted Russell (photographer)|Ted Russell]], and [https://web.archive.org/web/20090323120015/http://www.bobdylanphotobook.com/ Joe Alper], who was known for his early '60s photographs of [[Bob Dylan]]) The sparse black-and-white back covers bore the slogan, \"The New Wave of Jazz is on IMPULSE!\". Most Impulse! LPs were issued in a gatefold sleeve, with photographs and liner notes, in some cases, multi-page booklets.\n\n===Early success===\nTaylor achieved early success by signing [[Ray Charles]], who had just ended his contract with [[Atlantic Records]]. Charles's ''[[Genius + Soul = Jazz]]'' gave the label its first hit and became the fourth-highest charting album of his career.<ref>Kahn, 2006, p.35</ref> Other early successes included ''[[Out of the Cool]]'' by [[Gil Evans]]. Taylor also signed [[John Coltrane]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-house-that-trane-built-the-story-of-impulse-records-mw0001996707|title=The House That Trane Built: The Story of Impulse Records - Various Artists {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2017-09-07}}</ref>\n\nAnother significant early release was ''[[The Blues and the Abstract Truth]]'' by [[Oliver Nelson]], who led an all-star group that featured [[Freddie Hubbard]], [[Eric Dolphy]], [[Bill Evans]], [[Paul Chambers]], and [[Roy Haynes]]. Nelson played an important role in the label's early years before relocating to Los Angeles, where he became an arranger for film and television.\n\nTaylor left Impulse! in the summer of 1961 after being approached by MGM to become the head of [[Verve Records]].\n\n===The Thiele Years: 1961-69===\n[[Bob Thiele]], Taylor's successor, produced most of the albums in the 1960s. He had worked for [[Decca Records]] and its subsidiaries, [[Coral Records|Coral]] and [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick]], where his production credits included [[Alan Dale]], [[The McGuire Sisters]], [[Pearl Bailey]], and [[Theresa Brewer]], whom he married. Despite resistance from Decca executives who were suspicious of rock and roll, Thiele signed [[Buddy Holly]] in 1957.<ref>Kahn, 2006, p.63</ref>\n\nThiele's first Impulse! production was Coltrane's ''[[Live! at the Village Vanguard]]'', released in March 1962. Although unfamiliar with the \"new jazz\" movement, Thiele backed his artists, afforded them unprecedented freedom in their repertoire, and gave leading acts like Coltrane ''[[blank cheque|carte blanche]]'' in the studio. Impulse! during the Thiele years is recognized as a key outlet for [[free jazz]] and the musical movement spearheaded by Coltrane, [[Freddie Hubbard]], [[Archie Shepp]], and [[McCoy Tyner]]. In addition to avant-garde releases, Thiele also produced collaborations between Coltrane and two of their mutual heroes, [[Duke Ellington]] and [[Coleman Hawkins]]. Other notable performers who recorded for Impulse! during this period included [[Charles Mingus]].\n\nAided by good promotion and ABC-Paramount's well-established distribution chain, Coltrane enjoyed the highest profile and the strongest and most consistent sales of any Impulse! artist. In addition to its artistic influence, Coltrane's 1965 LP ''[[A Love Supreme]]'' became one of the most successful jazz albums ever released, selling over 100,000 copies<ref>Kahn, 2006, p.5</ref> on its first release. By 1970 it had sold more than half a million. [[Roger McGuinn]] of [[The Byrds]] has stated that he listened to Coltrane extensively in this period, and that Coltrane's saxophone playing influenced his 12-string guitar playing on the hit \"[[Eight Miles High]]\".\n\nThiele severed his ties with Impulse! in 1969, setting up a short-lived deal to provide independently-produced recordings, before leaving the label entirely to establish his own imprint, [[Flying Dutchman Records]]. Thiele's departure was in part precipitated by the breakdown of his relationship with [[Larry Newton]], the president of ABC Records.\n\nOne of Thiele's last productions was the Louis Armstrong song \"[[What A Wonderful World]]\", which Thiele co-wrote and produced for ABC's pop division shortly before Armstrong's death. Although the musicians were apparently unaware of the drama, the recording session is reported to have been the scene of a clash between Thiele and Newton. When Newton arrived at the session he became upset when he discovered that Armstrong was recording a ballad rather than a '[[Dixieland]]'-style number like his earlier hit \"[[Hello, Dolly! (song)|Hello Dolly]]\". According to Thiele's own account, this led to a screaming match; Newton then had to be locked out of the studio and he stood outside throughout the session, banging on the door and yelling to be let in. The single was released with little promotion from ABC and it sold relatively poorly in the U.S.. In Europe, it sold more than 1.5 million copies and went to #1 in the UK. Demand from ABC's European distributor [[EMI]] for an album forced ABC to issue one, but they did not promote the album and it did not chart in the U.S. Twenty years later, it became the most successful recording of both Armstrong's and Thiele's careers, thanks to its inclusion on the soundtrack ''[[Good Morning, Vietnam]]''.\n\n===The 1970s===\nUnder the guidance of [[Ed Michel]], Thiele's successor, Impulse! continued to issue notable recordings, including the debut album by the [[Liberation Music Orchestra]], the first of four acclaimed collaborations between [[Charlie Haden]] and [[Carla Bley]]. The company also acquired LPs that [[Sun Ra]] had recorded for his private label, making them more widely available for the first time.\n\nIn the early 1970s ABC restructured its recording division, merging the ABC label with its other pop-rock subsidiary, [[Dunhill Records]], whose roster included [[The Mamas & the Papas]], [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]], [[Three Dog Night]], and [[Steely Dan]]. Impulse! was moved to share headquarters with ABC-Dunhill in [[Los Angeles]]. By this time pop-rock acts dominated the company's output, with Impulse! releases accounting for only 5 percent of total sales. It was also during this time that Impulse! became the first all-jazz label to release a rock album when it issued ''[[Trespass (album)|Trespass]]'', the second album by [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], in the U.S. in 1970.\n\nIn 1974, ABC acquired the [[Famous Music]] labels and catalog from [[Gulf+Western]], and subsequently, that company's jazz recordings were incorporated into the Impulse! catalog. New recordings from the label ceased in the late 1970s, but ABC reissued titles until the company was sold to [[MCA Records]] in 1979. It is now part of [[Universal Music Group]]'s jazz holdings, [[Verve Records|The Verve Music Group]].\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Impulse!

His argument centers on the idea that predictive models are based on Plato's ''Theory of Forms'', gravitating towards mathematical purity and failing to take some key ideas into account, such as: the impossibility of possessing all relevant information, that small unknown variations in the data can have a huge impact, and flawed theories/models that are based on empirical data and that fail to consider events that have not taken place, but could have taken place. Discussing the ludic fallacy in ''The Black Swan'', he writes, \"The dark side of the moon is harder to see; beaming light on it costs energy. In the same way, beaming light on the unseen is costly, in both computational and mental effort.\"\n\nIn the second edition of ''The Black Swan'', he posited that the foundations of [[quantitative analyst|quantitative economics]] are faulty and highly self-referential. He states that statistics is fundamentally incomplete as a field, as it cannot predict the risk of rare events, a problem that is acute in proportion to the rarity of these events. With the mathematician [[Raphael Douady]], he called the problem ''statistical undecidability'' (Douady and Taleb, 2010).{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nTaleb has described his main challenge as mapping his ideas of \"robustification\" and \"[[antifragility]]\", that is, how to live and act in a world we do not understand and build robustness to black swan events. Taleb introduced the idea of the \"fourth quadrant\" in the exposure domain.<ref>Taleb, N. N. (2009). Errors, robustness, and the fourth quadrant. [http://econpapers.repec.org/article/eeeintfor/v_3a25_3ay_3a2009_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a744-759.htm International Journal of Forecasting, 25(4), 744\u201359]</ref> One of its applications is in his definition of the most effective (that is, least fragile) risk management approach: what he calls the 'barbell' strategy which is based on avoiding the middle in favor of linear combination of extremes, across all domains from politics to economics to one's personal life. These are deemed by Taleb to be more robust to estimation errors. For instance, he suggests that investing money in 'medium risk' investments is pointless, because risk is difficult, if not impossible to compute. His preferred strategy is to be both hyper-conservative and hyper-aggressive at the same time. For example, an investor might put 80 to 90% of their money in extremely safe instruments, such as treasury bills, with the remainder going into highly risky and diversified speculative bets. An alternative suggestion is to engage in highly speculative bets with a limited downside.\n\nTaleb asserts that by adopting these strategies a portfolio can be \"robust\", that is, gain a positive exposure to black swan events while limiting losses suffered by such random events.<ref>Taleb, ''The Black Swan'', pg 207</ref>{{rp|207}} Together with [[Donald Geman]] and [[H\u00e9lyette Geman]], he modeled the \"maximum entropy barbell\" which consists in \"to constrain only what can be constrained (in a robust manner) and to maximize entropy elsewhere\", based on an insight by E. T. Jaynes that economic life increases in entropy under regulatory and other constraints.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Geman | first1 = D. | last2 = Geman | first2 = H. | last3 = Taleb | first3 = N.

Instead of doing steady and moderate exercise daily, he suggests that it is better to do a low-effort exercise such as walking slowly most of the time, while occasionally expending extreme effort. He claims that the human body evolved to live in a random environment, with various unexpected but intense efforts and much rest.<ref>{{cite book |first=Nassim Nicholas|last=Taleb |year=2012 |title=Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder |publisher=[[Random House]]|title-link=Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder }}</ref>\n\nHe appeared as a special guest on ''[[The Ron Paul Liberty Report]]'' on May 19, 2017 and stated his support for a [[non-interventionist]] foreign policy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjVPQUv6xm4|title=Black Swans And Interventionistas ...

For the U.S. stock market, a single day, [[Black Monday (1987)|the crash of 1987]], determined 80% of the kurtosis. The same problem is found with interest and exchange rates, commodities, and other variables. The problem is not just that the data had \"fat tails\", something people knew but sort of wanted to forget; it was that we would never be able to determine \"how fat\" the tails were. Never. The implication is that those tools used in economics that are based on squaring variables (more technically, the [[Euclidean norm|Euclidean]], or [[norm (mathematics)#p-norm|''L''<sup>2</sup> norm]]), such as [[standard deviation]], variance, correlation, regression, or value-at-risk, the kind of stuff you find in textbooks, are not valid scientifically (except in some rare cases where the variable is bounded).

His argument centers on the idea that predictive models are based on Plato's ''Theory of Forms'', gravitating towards mathematical purity and failing to take some key ideas into account, such as: the impossibility of possessing all relevant information, that small unknown variations in the data can have a huge impact, and flawed theories/models that are based on empirical data and that fail to consider events that have not taken place, but could have taken place. Discussing the ludic fallacy in ''The Black Swan'', he writes, \"The dark side of the moon is harder to see; beaming light on it costs energy. In the same way, beaming light on the unseen is costly, in both computational and mental effort.\"\n\nIn the second edition of ''The Black Swan'', he posited that the foundations of [[quantitative analyst|quantitative economics]] are faulty and highly self-referential. He states that statistics is fundamentally incomplete as a field, as it cannot predict the risk of rare events, a problem that is acute in proportion to the rarity of these events. With the mathematician [[Raphael Douady]], he called the problem ''statistical undecidability'' (Douady and Taleb, 2010).{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nTaleb has described his main challenge as mapping his ideas of \"robustification\" and \"[[antifragility]]\", that is, how to live and act in a world we do not understand and build robustness to black swan events. Taleb introduced the idea of the \"fourth quadrant\" in the exposure domain.<ref>Taleb, N. N. (2009). Errors, robustness, and the fourth quadrant. [http://econpapers.repec.org/article/eeeintfor/v_3a25_3ay_3a2009_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a744-759.htm International Journal of Forecasting, 25(4), 744\u201359]</ref> One of its applications is in his definition of the most effective (that is, least fragile) risk management approach: what he calls the 'barbell' strategy which is based on avoiding the middle in favor of linear combination of extremes, across all domains from politics to economics to one's personal life. These are deemed by Taleb to be more robust to estimation errors. For instance, he suggests that investing money in 'medium risk' investments is pointless, because risk is difficult, if not impossible to compute. His preferred strategy is to be both hyper-conservative and hyper-aggressive at the same time. For example, an investor might put 80 to 90% of their money in extremely safe instruments, such as treasury bills, with the remainder going into highly risky and diversified speculative bets. An alternative suggestion is to engage in highly speculative bets with a limited downside.\n\nTaleb asserts that by adopting these strategies a portfolio can be \"robust\", that is, gain a positive exposure to black swan events while limiting losses suffered by such random events.<ref>Taleb, ''The Black Swan'', pg 207</ref>{{rp|207}} Together with [[Donald Geman]] and [[H\u00e9lyette Geman]], he modeled the \"maximum entropy barbell\" which consists in \"to constrain only what can be constrained (in a robust manner) and to maximize entropy elsewhere\", based on an insight by E. T. Jaynes that economic life increases in entropy under regulatory and other constraints.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Geman | first1 = D. | last2 = Geman | first2 = H. | last3 = Taleb | first3 = N.

Instead of doing steady and moderate exercise daily, he suggests that it is better to do a low-effort exercise such as walking slowly most of the time, while occasionally expending extreme effort. He claims that the human body evolved to live in a random environment, with various unexpected but intense efforts and much rest.<ref>{{cite book |first=Nassim Nicholas|last=Taleb |year=2012 |title=Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder |publisher=[[Random House]]|title-link=Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder }}</ref>\n\nHe appeared as a special guest on ''[[The Ron Paul Liberty Report]]'' on May 19, 2017 and stated his support for a [[non-interventionist]] foreign policy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjVPQUv6xm4|title=Black Swans And Interventionistas ...

For the U.S. stock market, a single day, [[Black Monday (1987)|the crash of 1987]], determined 80% of the kurtosis. The same problem is found with interest and exchange rates, commodities, and other variables. The problem is not just that the data had \"fat tails\", something people knew but sort of wanted to forget; it was that we would never be able to determine \"how fat\" the tails were. Never. The implication is that those tools used in economics that are based on squaring variables (more technically, the [[Euclidean norm|Euclidean]], or [[norm (mathematics)#p-norm|''L''<sup>2</sup> norm]]), such as [[standard deviation]], variance, correlation, regression, or value-at-risk, the kind of stuff you find in textbooks, are not valid scientifically (except in some rare cases where the variable is bounded).

This single-coil (size) stack consists of a row of paired single-coils stacked one on top of the other (compacted), so-as-to fit (incognito) into the same size width space as a regular single-coil pickup. This is to be contrasted with the original [[humbucking pickup]] design, which is a row of paired (opposite phase) single-coils double wide.<ref>https://www.proaudioland.com/news/noiseless-single-coil-electric-guitar-pickups/</ref>\n\nThe series includes models for electric guitars and bass guitars.\n\n==Vintage Noiseless==\nThe Noiseless pickups now referred to as '''Vintage Noiseless'''<ref>https://shop.fender.com/en-US/parts/stratocaster-parts/fender-vintage-noiseless-strat-pickups/0992115000.html</ref> were original equipment on the [[Fender American Deluxe Series]] [[Fender Stratocaster|Stratocaster]] instruments made between 1998 and 2003.

Samarium cobalt is a rare earth magnet that is more powerful than the Alnico 5 magnets traditionally used in pickup design. The SCN pickups were a standard equipment feature on the [[Fender American Deluxe Series|American Deluxe]] series [[Fender Stratocaster|Stratocaster]] from 2004 to 2010, and were available for the [[Fender Telecaster|Telecaster]] and [[Fender Jazz Bass|Jazz Bass]], but are no longer manufactured by Fender.

He was a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] from 1895 to 1897, and the [[List of Governors of New York|32nd Governor of New York]] from 1897 to 1898.\n\n==Early life==\nBlack was born near [[Limington, Maine|Limington, York County, Maine]] on March 8, 1853, one of eleven children born to Jacob, a farmer, and Charlotte B. Black. He graduated from [[Lebanon, Maine|Lebanon]] Academy in 1871, and taught school while attending [[Dartmouth College]], from which he graduated in 1875.\n\n==Start of career==\nAfter completing his education, Black moved to [[Johnstown (city), New York|Johnstown, New York]] to become editor of the ''Johnstown Journal''. A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and ardent follower of [[James G. Blaine]], also from Maine, Black changed the political stance of the paper while the Democratic owner was out of town, but was promptly dismissed upon the latter's return. He then moved to [[Troy, New York]], and worked for the ''Troy Whig'' and the ''Troy Times''. While working as a night reporter, he was a clerk in the Troy post office and [[reading law|studied law]] with the firm of Robertson & Foster. Black attained [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admission to the bar]] in 1879 and began to practice in Troy.\n\nIn 1888, Black campaigned for [[Benjamin Harrison]] for president. In 1892, he campaigned for Harrison's reelection, but Harrison was defeated by former President [[Grover Cleveland]]. In March 1894, an election day dispute between Republicans and Democrats in Troy culminated with the [[murder of Robert Ross]], a Republican. Black assisted in the prosecution of the defendants, Democrats Bartholomew \"Bat\" Shea and John McGough, who were convicted. McGough was sentenced to 20 years in prison, and Shea was executed.\n\n==U.S. House==\nLargely as a result of the Ross murder case, in November 1894, Black was elected to the [[54th United States Congress]], representing [[New York's 19th congressional district]]. He served from March 4, 1895 to January 7, 1897, when he resigned because he had been elected governor. During bhis Houe term, Black was a member of the Committee on Pacific Railroads and the Committee on Private Land Claims. He was a delegate to the [[1896 Republican National Convention]] and supported [[William McKinley]] for president.\n\n==Governor==\nBlack was elected governor [[New York state election, 1896|in 1896]] and served from January 1, 1897 to December 31, 1898. A highlight of his governorship was completion of construction on the [[New York State Capitol]], which had fallen far behind schedule and had been plagued with cost overruns.\n\nOne of Black's appointees to the Erie Canal Commission was found to have illegally spent a million dollars, which jeopardized Black's chances for reelection. As a result, Republicans replaced him as the gubernatorial nominee 1898 with [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who had recently attained hero status in Cuba during the [[Spanish-American War]].<ref>Edmond Morris, ''The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt '' (1979) p 666</ref> Roosevelt won the November general election by narrowly defeating Democratic nominee [[Augustus Van Wyck]].\n\n==Later life==\nAfterwards he resumed his law practice. Among the noteworthy cases in which he was involved, Black took part in the defense of Roland B. Molineaux in the famed ''[[People v. Molineux]]'' case. After Molineaux was convicted of murder, the conviction was overturned and he won an acquittal at retrial. The case was the source of the well-known \"Molineux rule\" which limits the ability of prosecutors to use prior crimes as proof that a defendant committed the crime with which he is charged. Black also took part in the defense of [[Caleb Powers]] for the assassination of Kentucky governor [[William Goebel]].\n\nBlack maintained his interest in politics even after leaving office. He was a delegate to the [[1904 Republican National Convention]], and nominated President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] for election to a full term.\n\n==Death and burial==\nBlack died from heart disease at his home in Troy on March 22, 1913.<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1913/03/22/100612163.pdf \"Ex-Gov Black Dies at His Troy Home\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'' March 22, 1913</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/47101597/frank-s-black-dies-of-disease-of-heart/ |title=Frank S.

A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and ardent follower of [[James G. Blaine]], also from Maine, Black changed the political stance of the paper while the Democratic owner was out of town, but was promptly dismissed upon the latter's return. He then moved to [[Troy, New York]], and worked for the ''Troy Whig'' and the ''Troy Times''. While working as a night reporter, he was a clerk in the Troy post office and [[reading law|studied law]] with the firm of Robertson & Foster. Black attained [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admission to the bar]] in 1879 and began to practice in Troy.\n\nIn 1888, Black campaigned for [[Benjamin Harrison]] for president. In 1892, he campaigned for Harrison's reelection, but Harrison was defeated by former President [[Grover Cleveland]]. In March 1894, an election day dispute between Republicans and Democrats in Troy culminated with the [[murder of Robert Ross]], a Republican. Black assisted in the prosecution of the defendants, Democrats Bartholomew \"Bat\" Shea and John McGough, who were convicted. McGough was sentenced to 20 years in prison, and Shea was executed.\n\n==U.S. House==\nLargely as a result of the Ross murder case, in November 1894, Black was elected to the [[54th United States Congress]], representing [[New York's 19th congressional district]]. He served from March 4, 1895 to January 7, 1897, when he resigned because he had been elected governor. During bhis Houe term, Black was a member of the Committee on Pacific Railroads and the Committee on Private Land Claims. He was a delegate to the [[1896 Republican National Convention]] and supported [[William McKinley]] for president.\n\n==Governor==\nBlack was elected governor [[New York state election, 1896|in 1896]] and served from January 1, 1897 to December 31, 1898. A highlight of his governorship was completion of construction on the [[New York State Capitol]], which had fallen far behind schedule and had been plagued with cost overruns.  One of Black's appointees to the Erie Canal Commission was found to have illegally spent a million dollars, which jeopardized Black's chances for reelection. As a result, Republicans replaced him as the gubernatorial nominee 1898 with [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who had recently attained hero status in Cuba during the [[Spanish-American War]].<ref>Edmond Morris, ''The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt '' (1979) p 666</ref> Roosevelt won the November general election by narrowly defeating Democratic nominee [[Augustus Van Wyck]].\n\n==Later life==\nAfterwards he resumed his law practice. Among the noteworthy cases in which he was involved, Black took part in the defense of Roland B. Molineaux in the famed ''[[People v. Molineux]]'' case. After Molineaux was convicted of murder, the conviction was overturned and he won an acquittal at retrial. The case was the source of the well-known \"Molineux rule\" which limits the ability of prosecutors to use prior crimes as proof that a defendant committed the crime with which he is charged. Black also took part in the defense of [[Caleb Powers]] for the assassination of Kentucky governor [[William Goebel]].\n\nBlack maintained his interest in politics even after leaving office. He was a delegate to the [[1904 Republican National Convention]], and nominated President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] for election to a full term.\n\n==Death and burial==\nBlack died from heart disease at his home in Troy on March 22, 1913.<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1913/03/22/100612163.pdf \"Ex-Gov Black Dies at His Troy Home\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'' March 22, 1913</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/47101597/frank-s-black-dies-of-disease-of-heart/ |title=Frank S.
