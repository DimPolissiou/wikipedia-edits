The history of Kasur is more than 1,000 years. Kasur region was agricultural region with forests during the [[Indus Valley Civilization]]. The [[Vedic period]] is characterized by [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]] culture that migrated from [[Central Asia]] and settled in [[Punjab region]]. The [[Kambojas]], [[Daradas]], [[Kekaya|Kaikayas]], [[Pauravas]], [[Yaudheya]]s, [[Malavas]] and [[Kuru (kingdom)|Kuru]]s migrated, settled and ruled ancient Punjab region. After overrunning the [[Achaemenid dynasty|Achaemenid Empire]] in 331 BCE, [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] marched into present-day Punjab region with an army of 50,000. The Kasur region was ruled by [[Maurya Empire]], [[Indo-Greek kingdom]], [[Kushan Empire]], [[Gupta Empire]], [[Hephthalite Empire|White Huns]], [[Kushano-Hephthalites]] and [[Shahi]] kingdoms.\n\nIn 997 CE, [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi]], took over the [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznavid dynasty]] empire established by his father, [[Sabuktigin|Sultan Sebuktegin]], In 1005 he conquered the [[Shahi]]s in [[Kabul]] in 1005, and followed it by the conquests of Punjab region. The [[Delhi Sultanate]] and later [[Mughal Empire]] ruled the region. The Punjab region became predominantly [[Muslim]] due to [[missionary]] [[Sufi]] saints whose [[dargah]]s dot the landscape of the Punjab region.\n\nThe [[Mughal Empire]] ruled Kasur for 200 years. After and during the decline of the [[Mughal Empire]], the [[Sikh]]s took over the Kasur District. The agriculture lands were given to leaders and supporters of the Sikh army. Most of the Punjab region was annexed by the [[East India Company]] in 1849, and was one of the last areas of the [[South Asia]] to fall under [[British Raj|British colonial rule]]. During the [[British Raj]], the irrigation canals were built that irrigated large areas barren lands of the Kasur District.\n\nThe predominantly Muslim population supported [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] and [[Pakistan Movement]].  After the [[Partition of India|independence]] of [[Pakistan]] in 1947, the minority [[Hindu]]s and Sikhs migrated to [[India]] while the Muslim refugees from India settled in the Kasur District.\n\n== Demography ==\nAccording to the 1998 census, [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] is the most widely spoken [[first language]]<ref>\"Mother tongue\": defined as the language of communication between parents and children.</ref> ({{sigfig|88.2|2}}%), whereas [[Urdu]] was the first language of 6.2% of the population. The district is unusual in that Urdu accounts for a greater proportion of speakers in rural (7.3%) than in urban areas (2.6%).<ref name=\"1998census\"/>{{rp|23\u201324}}\n\n== Development ==\nThe [[Bambawali-Ravi-Bedian Canal]] was built in Kasur district increasing the agricultural development of the area. There has been commercial and industrial development but the area remain mainly agricultural.

The history of Kasur is more than 1,000 years. Kasur region was agricultural region with forests during the [[Indus Valley Civilization]]. The [[Vedic period]] is characterized by [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]] culture that migrated from [[Central Asia]] and settled in [[Punjab region]]. The [[Kambojas]], [[Daradas]], [[Kekaya|Kaikayas]], [[Pauravas]], [[Yaudheya]]s, [[Malavas]] and [[Kuru (kingdom)|Kuru]]s migrated, settled and ruled ancient Punjab region. After overrunning the [[Achaemenid dynasty|Achaemenid Empire]] in 331 BCE, [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] marched into present-day Punjab region with an army of 50,000. The Kasur region was ruled by [[Maurya Empire]], [[Indo-Greek kingdom]], [[Kushan Empire]], [[Gupta Empire]], [[Hephthalite Empire|White Huns]], [[Kushano-Hephthalites]] and [[Shahi]] kingdoms.\n\nIn 997 CE, [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi]], took over the [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznavid dynasty]] empire established by his father, [[Sabuktigin|Sultan Sebuktegin]], In 1005 he conquered the [[Shahi]]s in [[Kabul]] in 1005, and followed it by the conquests of Punjab region. The [[Delhi Sultanate]] and later [[Mughal Empire]] ruled the region. The Punjab region became predominantly [[Muslim]] due to [[missionary]] [[Sufi]] saints whose [[dargah]]s dot the landscape of the Punjab region.\n\nThe [[Mughal Empire]] ruled Kasur for 200 years. After and during the decline of the [[Mughal Empire]], the [[Sikh]]s took over the Kasur District. The agriculture lands were given to leaders and supporters of the Sikh army. Most of the Punjab region was annexed by the [[East India Company]] in 1849, and was one of the last areas of the [[South Asia]] to fall under [[British Raj|British colonial rule]]. During the [[British Raj]], the irrigation canals were built that irrigated large areas barren lands of the Kasur District.\n\nThe predominantly Muslim population supported [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] and [[Pakistan Movement]].  After the [[Partition of India|independence]] of [[Pakistan]] in 1947, the minority [[Hindu]]s and Sikhs migrated to [[India]] while the Muslim refugees from India settled in the Kasur District.\n\n== Demography ==\nAccording to the 1998 census, [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] is the most widely spoken [[first language]]<ref>\"Mother tongue\": defined as the language of communication between parents and children.</ref> ({{sigfig|88.2|2}}%), whereas [[Urdu]] was the first language of 6.2% of the population.
