The series began on October 28, 2003 and ended on October 21, 2008.<ref name=\"vol6\"/>\n\n==Overview==\nThe ''Golden Collection'' series was launched following the success of the ''[[Walt Disney Treasures]]'' series which collected archived Disney material.\n\nThese collections were made possible after the merger of [[Time Warner]] (which owned the color cartoons released from August 1, 1948 onward, as well as the black-and-white ''[[Looney Tunes]]'', the post-Harman/Ising black-and-white ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' and the first H/I ''Merrie Melodies'' entry ''[[Lady, Play Your Mandolin!]]'') and [[Turner Broadcasting System]] (which owned the color cartoons released prior to August 1, 1948 and the remaining Harman/Ising ''Merrie Melodies''; most of these cartoons had been released as part of ''[[The Golden Age of Looney Tunes]]'' [[laserdisc]] series), along with the subsequent transfer of video rights to the Turner library from [[MGM Home Entertainment]] to [[Warner Home Video]].\n\nThe cartoons included on the set are uncut, unedited, uncensored and digitally restored and remastered from the original black-and-white and successive exposure [[Technicolor]] film negatives (or, in the case of the [[Cinecolor]] shorts, the Technicolor reprints). However, some of the cartoons in these collections are derived from the \"Blue Ribbon\" reissues (altered from their original versions with their revised front-and-end credit sequences), as the original titles for these cartoons are presumably lost. Where the original titles, instead of the \"Blue Ribbon\" titles, still exist, Warner has taken the \"Blue Ribbon\" titles out.\n\nA handful of cartoons in the first two collections and the bonus cartoons on Volume 6 have digital video [[Image noise reduction|noise reduction]] (DVNR) artifacting. The noise reduction process sometimes unintentionally erases or blurs some of the picture on certain scenes of the cartoons, which has caused controversy among some Looney Tunes fans. The most recent collections, however, lack such artifacting. Since August 2007, Warner Bros. Home Video has been quietly reissuing copies of the fourth disc of Volume 2 that lacks artifacting and interlacing because of numerous complaints by consumers.\n\nBeginning with Volume 3, a warning was printed on the packaging explaining that the collection is intended for adults and the content may not be suitable for children (except for Volume 6, which states that it ''isn't'' suitable for children). This goes along with [[Whoopi Goldberg]]'s filmed introduction in Volume 3 that explains the history of ethnic imagery that frequently appears in cartoons of the 1930s and 1940s. Beginning with Volume 4, a singular disclaimer text card similar to Goldberg's spoken disclaimer precedes each disc's main menu. This is seen on the ''[[Tom and Jerry Spotlight Collection]]'' discs and even on the back of the ''[[Woody Woodpecker and Friends Classic Cartoon Collection]]'' discs (though they are from Universal, not Warner Bros.).\n\nThe DVDs also feature several special features including interviews/documentaries of the people behind the cartoons such as [[Friz Freleng]], [[Bob Clampett]], [[Tex Avery]], [[Robert McKimson]], [[Chuck Jones]], musical conductor [[Carl Stalling]] and voice-artist [[Mel Blanc]], [[pencil]] tests, and audio commentaries by animation historians [[Jerry Beck]], [[Michael Barrier (historian)|Michael Barrier]] and [[Greg Ford]], as well as current animators [[Paul Dini]], [[Eric Goldberg (film director)|Eric Goldberg]] and [[John Kricfalusi]] and voice actors [[Stan Freberg]] and [[June Foray]]. In addition to the appearances by the above-mentioned, there is interview footage of Stan Freberg, June Foray, [[Noel Blanc]], [[Billy West]], [[Keith Scott (voice actor)|Keith Scott]], [[Mark Evanier]], [[Bob Bergen]], [[Joe Alaskey]], [[Bill Melendez]], Willie Ito, Corny Cole, [[Peter Alvarado]] and the children of the various directors: Robert McKimson, Jr., Ruth Clampett, Sybil Freleng and Linda Jones. Audio footage of Mel Blanc in recording sessions is heard as a bonus feature on several of the discs, as is an obscure audio clip of [[Arthur Q. Bryan]] rehearsing a line as [[Elmer Fudd]] in ''[[What's Opera, Doc?]]''. In total, there are 356 cartoons (18 more than ''The Golden Age of Looney Tunes'') spread throughout the six volumes.\n\nIn some regions, such as Regions 2 and 4, each disc in each volume is packaged (or re-packaged) separately.<ref>[http://www.michaeldvd.com.au/Reviews/Reviews.asp?ID=4523 Looney Tunes Collection-All Stars-Volumes 1 & 2 (2003)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Releases==\n\n===[[Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 1|Volume 1]]===\nVolume 1 (released on October 28, 2003) contains 56 cartoons (all in color) mostly from the 1950s with a smaller selection of shorts from the 1940s.

Warner Bros. stated the reason for this was that all post-1953 WB shorts were shown in matted-widescreen in theaters.\n\nOn December 1, 2010, animation expert [[Jerry Beck]] explained on the Shokus Internet Radio call-in talk program, ''Stu's Show'' that Warner aimed this series not at collectors, but at the mass market who expect it to fit on their widescreen TVs.

The series began on October 28, 2003 and ended on October 21, 2008.<ref name=\"vol6\"/>\n\n==Overview==\nThe ''Golden Collection'' series was launched following the success of the ''[[Walt Disney Treasures]]'' series which collected archived Disney material.\n\nThese collections were made possible after the merger of [[Time Warner]] (which owned the color cartoons released from August 1, 1948 onward, as well as the black-and-white ''[[Looney Tunes]]'', the post-Harman/Ising black-and-white ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' and the first H/I ''Merrie Melodies'' entry ''[[Lady, Play Your Mandolin!]]'') and [[Turner Broadcasting System]] (which owned the color cartoons released prior to August 1, 1948 and the remaining Harman/Ising ''Merrie Melodies''; most of these cartoons had been released as part of ''[[The Golden Age of Looney Tunes]]'' [[laserdisc]] series), along with the subsequent transfer of video rights to the Turner library from [[MGM Home Entertainment]] to [[Warner Home Video]].\n\nThe cartoons included on the set are uncut, unedited, uncensored and digitally restored and remastered from the original black-and-white and successive exposure [[Technicolor]] film negatives (or, in the case of the [[Cinecolor]] shorts, the Technicolor reprints). However, some of the cartoons in these collections are derived from the \"Blue Ribbon\" reissues (altered from their original versions with their revised front-and-end credit sequences), as the original titles for these cartoons are presumably lost. Where the original titles, instead of the \"Blue Ribbon\" titles, still exist, Warner has taken the \"Blue Ribbon\" titles out.\n\nA handful of cartoons in the first two collections and the bonus cartoons on Volume 6 have digital video [[Image noise reduction|noise reduction]] (DVNR) artifacting. The noise reduction process sometimes unintentionally erases or blurs some of the picture on certain scenes of the cartoons, which has caused controversy among some Looney Tunes fans. The most recent collections, however, lack such artifacting. Since August 2007, Warner Bros. Home Video has been quietly reissuing copies of the fourth disc of Volume 2 that lacks artifacting and interlacing because of numerous complaints by consumers.\n\nBeginning with Volume 3, a warning was printed on the packaging explaining that the collection is intended for adults and the content may not be suitable for children (except for Volume 6, which states that it ''isn't'' suitable for children). This goes along with [[Whoopi Goldberg]]'s filmed introduction in Volume 3 that explains the history of ethnic imagery that frequently appears in cartoons of the 1930s and 1940s. Beginning with Volume 4, a singular disclaimer text card similar to Goldberg's spoken disclaimer precedes each disc's main menu. This is seen on the ''[[Tom and Jerry Spotlight Collection]]'' discs and even on the back of the ''[[Woody Woodpecker and Friends Classic Cartoon Collection]]'' discs (though they are from Universal, not Warner Bros.).\n\nThe DVDs also feature several special features including interviews/documentaries of the people behind the cartoons such as [[Friz Freleng]], [[Bob Clampett]], [[Tex Avery]], [[Robert McKimson]], [[Chuck Jones]], musical conductor [[Carl Stalling]] and voice-artist [[Mel Blanc]], [[pencil]] tests, and audio commentaries by animation historians [[Jerry Beck]], [[Michael Barrier (historian)|Michael Barrier]] and [[Greg Ford]], as well as current animators [[Paul Dini]], [[Eric Goldberg (film director)|Eric Goldberg]] and [[John Kricfalusi]] and voice actors [[Stan Freberg]] and [[June Foray]]. In addition to the appearances by the above-mentioned, there is interview footage of Stan Freberg, June Foray, [[Noel Blanc]], [[Billy West]], [[Keith Scott (voice actor)|Keith Scott]], [[Mark Evanier]], [[Bob Bergen]], [[Joe Alaskey]], [[Bill Melendez]], Willie Ito, Corny Cole, [[Peter Alvarado]] and the children of the various directors: Robert McKimson, Jr., Ruth Clampett, Sybil Freleng and Linda Jones. Audio footage of Mel Blanc in recording sessions is heard as a bonus feature on several of the discs, as is an obscure audio clip of [[Arthur Q. Bryan]] rehearsing a line as [[Elmer Fudd]] in ''[[What's Opera, Doc?]]''. In total, there are 356 cartoons (18 more than ''The Golden Age of Looney Tunes'') spread throughout the six volumes.\n\nIn some regions, such as Regions 2 and 4, each disc in each volume is packaged (or re-packaged) separately.<ref>[http://www.michaeldvd.com.au/Reviews/Reviews.asp?ID=4523 Looney Tunes Collection-All Stars-Volumes 1 & 2 (2003)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Releases==\n\n===[[Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 1|Volume 1]]===\nVolume 1 (released on October 28, 2003) contains 56 cartoons (all in color) mostly from the 1950s with a smaller selection of shorts from the 1940s.

Warner Bros. stated the reason for this was that all post-1953 WB shorts were shown in matted-widescreen in theaters.\n\nOn December 1, 2010, animation expert [[Jerry Beck]] explained on the Shokus Internet Radio call-in talk program, ''Stu's Show'' that Warner aimed this series not at collectors, but at the mass market who expect it to fit on their widescreen TVs.

He was the son and successor of [[Pacorus II]] ({{reign|78|110}}).\n\nVologases III's reign was marked by civil strife and warfare. At his ascension, he had to deal with the usurper [[Osroes I]] ({{reign|109|129}}), who managed to seize the western part of the empire, which left Vologases III in control of its eastern parts. After Osroes I violated the [[Treaty of Rhandeia]] with the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] by appointing [[Parthamasiris of Armenia|Parthamasiris]] as the king of [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]], the Roman emperor [[Trajan]] ({{reign|98|117}}) invaded the Parthian lands, briefly seizing the Parthian cities of [[Seleucia]] and [[Ctesiphon]] and reaching as far as the [[Persian Gulf]]. These gains were short-lived; after Trajan's death in 117, all the Roman gains had been lost. Vologases III, whose eastern domains were untouched, took advantage of the weakened state of Osroes I to regain lost territory, and by 129 finally defeated him. Another contender named [[Mithridates V of Parthia|Mithridates V]] shortly appeared afterwards, but was also defeated by Vologases III, in 140.\n\nFrom 134 to 136, Vologases III had to face an invasion by the nomadic [[Alans]], while in the east, he sought to increase the political and military actions as a response to the enlargement of the [[Kushan Empire]]. Under the Roman emperor [[Antoninus Pius]] ({{reign|138|161}}), disturbance once occurred in Armenia due to the Romans appointing a new king in Armenia.

He was the son and successor of [[Pacorus II]] ({{reign|78|110}}).\n\nVologases III's reign was marked by civil strife and warfare. At his ascension, he had to deal with the usurper [[Osroes I]] ({{reign|109|129}}), who managed to seize the western part of the empire, which left Vologases III in control of its eastern parts. After Osroes I violated the [[Treaty of Rhandeia]] with the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] by appointing [[Parthamasiris of Armenia|Parthamasiris]] as the king of [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]], the Roman emperor [[Trajan]] ({{reign|98|117}}) invaded the Parthian lands, briefly seizing the Parthian cities of [[Seleucia]] and [[Ctesiphon]] and reaching as far as the [[Persian Gulf]]. These gains were short-lived; after Trajan's death in 117, all the Roman gains had been lost. Vologases III, whose eastern domains were untouched, took advantage of the weakened state of Osroes I to regain lost territory, and by 129 finally defeated him. Another contender named [[Mithridates V of Parthia|Mithridates V]] shortly appeared afterwards, but was also defeated by Vologases III, in 140.\n\nFrom 134 to 136, Vologases III had to face an invasion by the nomadic [[Alans]], while in the east, he sought to increase the political and military actions as a response to the enlargement of the [[Kushan Empire]]. Under the Roman emperor [[Antoninus Pius]] ({{reign|138|161}}), disturbance once occurred in Armenia due to the Romans appointing a new king in Armenia. Vologases III, however, did not protest, either due to not being powerful enough, or possibly because he did not want to put the thriving long-distance in jeopardy, from which the Parthian state was gaining hefty income from.

The original appointed commanding officer was [[Commodore (USN)#History|Commodore]] [[Thomas ap Catesby Jones]]. Funding for the original expedition was requested by President [[John Quincy Adams]] in 1828, however, Congress would not implement funding until eight years later. In May 1836, the oceanic exploration voyage was finally authorized by [[United States Congress|Congress]] and created by President [[Andrew Jackson]].\n\nThe expedition is sometimes called the \"U.S. Ex.&nbsp;Ex.\" for short, or the \"Wilkes Expedition\" in honor of its next appointed commanding officer, [[United States Navy]] Lieutenant [[Charles Wilkes]]. The expedition was of major importance to the growth of science in the United States, in particular the then-young field of [[oceanography]]. During the event, armed conflict between Pacific islanders and the expedition was common and dozens of natives were killed in action, as well as a few Americans.\n\n== Preparations ==\nThrough the [[lobbying in the United States|lobbying efforts]] of [[Jeremiah N. Reynolds]], the [[United States House of Representatives]] passed a resolution on May 21, 1828, requesting President [[John Quincy Adams]] to send a ship to explore the Pacific. Adams was keen on the resolution and ordered his [[Secretary of the Navy]] to ready a ship, the [[USS Peacock (1813)|''Peacock'']], while the House voted an [[appropriation (law)|appropriation]] in December Yet, the bill stalled in the [[US Senate]] in February 1829. However, under President [[Andrew Jackson]], Congress passed legislation in 1836 approving the exploration mission. Yet again, the effort stalled under Secretary of the Navy [[Mahlon Dickerson]] until President [[Van Buren]] assumed office and pushed the effort forward.{{sfn|Stanton|1975|pp=13\u201317}}{{sfn|Dupree|1988|pp=59\u201365}}\n\nOriginally, the expedition was under the command [[Thomas ap Catesby Jones|Commodore Jones]], but he resigned in November 1837, frustrated with all of the procrastination. [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Joel Roberts Poinsett]], in April 1838, then assigned command to Wilkes, after more senior officers refused the command. Wilkes had a reputation for [[hydrography]], [[geodesy]], and [[magnetism]]. Additionally, Wilkes had received mathematics training from [[Nathaniel Bowditch]], [[triangulation]] methods from [[Ferdinand Hassler]], and [[geomagnetism]] from [[James Renwick (physicist)|James Renwick]].{{sfn|Stanton|1975|pp=19, 35, 56\u201361}}\n\nPersonnel included [[Natural history|naturalist]]s, [[botanist]]s, a [[mineralogist]], a [[taxidermist]], and a [[philologist]]. They were carried aboard the [[sloop-of-war|sloops-of-war]] {{USS|Vincennes|1826|6}} (780&nbsp;tons), and {{USS|Peacock|1828|6}} (650&nbsp;tons), the [[brig]] {{USS|Porpoise|1836|6}} (230&nbsp;tons), the [[full-rigged ship]] [[USS Relief (1836)|''Relief'']], which served as a [[auxiliary ship|store-ship]], and two [[schooner]]s, [[USS Sea Gull (1838)|''Sea Gull'']] (110&nbsp;tons) and {{USS |Flying Fish|1838|6}} (96&nbsp;tons), which served as [[ship's tender|tender]]s.{{sfn|Stanton|1975|pp=43, 63\u201368, 73\u201376}}\n\nOn the afternoon of August 18, 1838, the vessels weighed anchor and set to sea under full sail. By 0730 the next morning, they had passed the [[List of lightships of the United States|lightship]] off [[Willoughby Spit]] and discharged the [[maritime pilot|pilot]]. The fleet then headed to [[Madeira]], taking advantage of the prevailing winds.{{sfn|Stanton|1975|pp=71\u201376}}\n\nCoincidentally, [[Commodore (United States)|Commodore]] [[George C. Read]] in command of the [[East India Squadron]] aboard the [[flagship]] frigate [[USS Columbia (1836)|USS ''Columbia'']], together with the frigate [[USS John Adams (1799)|USS ''John Adams'']], were at the time in the process of circumnavigating the globe when the ships paused for the [[Second Sumatran expedition|second Sumatran punitive expedition]], which required no detour.\n\n== Ships and personnel ==\nThe expedition consisted of nearly 350 men, many of whom were not assigned to any specific vessel.

The squadron arrived in the [[Madeira Islands]] on September 16, 1838, and [[Porto Praya]] on October 6.{{sfn|Stanton|1975|pp=86\u201387}} The ''Peacock'' arrived at Rio de Janeiro on November 21, and the ''Vincennes'' with brigs and schooners on November 24. However, the ''Relief'' did not arrive until the November 27, setting a record for slowness, 100 days. While there, they used Enxados Island in [[Guanabara Bay]] for an observatory and naval yard for repair and refitting.{{sfn|Stanton|1975|pp=88\u201389}}\n\n[[File:Charles wilkes part1.png|thumb|left|upright=1.75|Voyage route:&nbsp;1.&nbsp;[[Hampton Roads]]&nbsp;\u2013 2.&nbsp;[[Madeira]]&nbsp;\u2013 3.&nbsp;[[Rio de Janeiro]]&nbsp;\u2013 4.&nbsp;[[Tierra del Fuego]]&nbsp;\u2013 5.&nbsp;[[Valpara\u00edso]]&nbsp;\u2013 6.&nbsp;[[Callao]]&nbsp;\u2013 7.&nbsp;[[Tahiti]]&nbsp;\u2013 8.&nbsp;[[Samoa]]&nbsp;\u2013 9.&nbsp;[[Sydney]]&nbsp;\u2013 10.&nbsp;[[Antarctica]]&nbsp;\u2013 11.&nbsp;[[Hawaiian Islands|Sandwich Islands (via Fiji)]]]]\nThe Squadron did not leave Rio de Janeiro until January 6, 1839, arriving at the mouth of the [[R\u00edo Negro (Argentina)|R\u00edo Negro]] on January 25. On February 19, the squadron joined the ''Relief'', ''Flying Fish'', and ''Sea Gull'' in Orange Harbor, [[Hoste Island]], after passing through [[Le Maire Strait]]. While there, the expedition came in contact with the [[Fuegians]]. Wilkes sent an expedition south in an attempt to exceed [[Captain Cook]]'s farthest point south, 71\u00b010'.\n\nThe ''Flying Fish'' reached 70\u00b0 on March 22, in the area about 100 miles north of [[Thurston Island]], and what is now called [[Cape Flying Fish]], and the [[Walker Mountains]]. The squadron joined the ''Peacock'' in [[Valparaiso]] on May 10, but the ''Sea Gull'' was reported missing. On June 6, the squadron arrived [[San Lorenzo Island (Peru)|San Lorenzo]], off [[Callao]] for repair and provisioning, while Wilkes dispatched the ''Relief'' homewards on June 21.{{sfn|Stanton|1975|pp=91\u201396, 103\u2013111}} Leaving South America on July 12, the expedition reached [[Reao]] of the [[Tuamotu]] Group on August 13, and [[Tahiti]] on September 11. They departed Tahiti on October 10.{{sfn|Stanton|1975|pp=114\u2013116, 123\u2013131}}\n\nThe expedition then visited [[Samoa]] and [[New South Wales]], Australia. In December 1839, the expedition sailed from Sydney into the [[Antarctic Ocean]] and reported the discovery of the [[Antarctica|Antarctic continent]] on January 16, 1840, when [[Henry Eld]] and [[William Reynolds (naval officer)|William Reynolds]] aboard the ''Peacock'' sighted [[Eld Peak]] and [[Reynolds Peak]] along the [[George V Coast]]. On the January 19, Reynolds spotted [[Cape Hudson]]. On January 25, the ''Vincennes'' sighted the mountains behind the [[Cook Ice Shelf]], similar peaks at [[Piner Bay]] on January 30, and had covered 800 miles of coastline by February 12, from 140\u00b0 30' E. to 112\u00b0 16' 12\"E., when Wilkes acknowledged they had \"discovered the Antarctic Continent.\" Named [[Wilkes Land]], it includes [[Claire Land]], [[Banzare Land]], [[Sabrina Land]], [[Budd Land]], and [[Knox Land]]. They charted 1500 miles of Antarctic coastline{{sfn|Philbrick|2003|p= [https://archive.org/details/seaofgloryameric00phil/page/n21 xix]}} to a westward goal of 105\u00b0 E., the edge of [[Queen Mary Land]], before departing to the north again on February 21.{{sfn|Stanton|1975|pp=132, 142\u2013149, 155\u2013159, 171\u2013175}}\n\nThe ''Porpoise'' came across the French expedition of [[Jules Dumont d'Urville]] on January 30. However, due to a misunderstanding of each other's intentions, the Porpoise and [[French ship Astrolabe (1811)|Astrolabe]] were unable to communicate.{{sfn|Stanton|1975|pp=176\u2013177}} In February 1840, some of the expedition were present at the initial signing of the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] in New Zealand.{{sfn|Wilkes|1845|p=376}} Some of the squadron then proceeded back to Sydney for repairs, while the rest visited the [[Bay of Islands]], before arriving in [[Tonga]] in April. At [[Nuku'alofa]] the met King Josiah (Aleamotu'a), and the George (Taufa'ahau), chief of [[Ha'apai]], before proceeding onwards to [[Fiji]] on May 4. The ''Porpoise'' surveyed the Low Archipelago, while the ''Vincennes'' and ''Peacock'' proceeded onwards to [[Ovalau (Fiji)|Ovalau]], where they signed a commercial treaty with [[Tanoa Visawaqa]] in [[Levuka]]. [[Edward Belcher]]'s {{HMS|Starling|1829|6}} visited Ovalau at the same time.{{sfn|Stanton|1975|pp=180\u2013195}} Hudson was able to capture Vendovi, after holding his brothers Cocanauto, Qaraniqio, and Tui Dreketi ([[Roko Tui Dreketi]] or King of [[Rewa Province]]) hostage. Vendovi was deemed responsible for the attack against US sailors on [[Ono Island (Fiji)|Ono Island]] in 1836. Vendovi was to be taken back to the US after a brief trial on board.{{sfn|Stanton|1975|pp=199\u2013201}}\n\nIn July 1840, two members of the party, Lieutenant Underwood and Wilkes' nephew, [[Midshipman]] Wilkes Henry, were killed while bartering for food in western [[Fiji]]'s [[Malolo]] Island. The cause of this event remains equivocal. Immediately prior to their deaths, the son of the local chief, who was being held as a hostage by the Americans, escaped by jumping out of the boat and running through the shallow water for shore. The Americans fired over his head. According to members of the expedition party on the boat, his escape was intended as a prearranged signal by the Fijians to attack. According to those on shore, the shooting actually precipitated the attack on the ground. The Americans landed sixty sailors to attack the hostile natives. Close to eighty Fijians were killed in the resulting American reprisal and two villages were burned to the ground.{{sfn|Philbrick|2003}}\n\n=== Return route ===\n[[File:Charles Wilkes part2.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Return route:&nbsp;1.&nbsp;[[Puget Sound]]&nbsp;\u2013 2.&nbsp;[[Columbia River]]&nbsp;\u2013 3.&nbsp;[[San&nbsp;Francisco]]&nbsp;\u2013 4.&nbsp;[[Polynesia]]&nbsp;\u2013 5.&nbsp;[[Philippines]]&nbsp;\u2013 6.&nbsp;[[Borneo]]&nbsp;\u2013 7.&nbsp;[[Singapore]]&nbsp;\u2013 8.&nbsp;[[Cape of Good Hope]]&nbsp;\u2013 9.&nbsp;[[New York City|New York]]]]\nOn August 9, after three months of surveying, the squadron met off [[Macuata]]. The ''Vincennes'' and ''Peacock'' proceeded onwards to the Sandwich Islands, with the ''Flying Fish'' and ''Porpoise'' to meet them in [[Oahu]] by October. Along the way, Wilkes named the [[Phoenix Islands|Phoenix Group]] and made a stop at the [[Palmyra Atoll]], making their group the first scientific expedition in history to visit Palmyra.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wilkes |first1=Charles |title=Excerpt from United States Exploring Expedition, Vol XXIII |url=http://www.palmyraarchive.org/items/show/58 |website=Palmyra Atoll Digital Archive}}</ref> While in Hawaii, the officers were welcomed by Governor [[Kekuanaoa]], King [[Kamehameha III]], his aide [[William Richards (Hawaii)|William Richards]], and the journalist [[James Jackson Jarves]]. The expedition surveyed [[Kauai]], Oahu, Hawaii, and the peak of [[Mauna Loa]]. The ''Porpoise'' was dispatched in November to survey several of the [[Tuamotu]]s, including [[Aratika]], [[Kauehi]], [[Raraka]], and [[Katiu]], before proceeding onwards to [[Penrhyn (atoll)|Penrhyn]] and returning to Oahu on 24 March.\n\nOn April 5, 1841, the squadron departed Honolulu, the ''Porpoise'' and ''Vincennes'' for the Pacific Northwest, the ''Peacock'' and ''Flying Fish'' to resurvey Samoa, before rejoining the squadron. Along the way, the ''Peacock'' and ''Flying Fish'' surveyed [[Jarvis Island]], [[Enderbury Island]], the [[Tokelau]] Islands, and [[Fakaofo]]. The ''Peacock'' followed this with surveys of the [[Tuvalu]] islands of [[Nukufetau]], [[Vaitupu]], and [[Nanumanga]] in March, followed by [[Tabiteuea]] in April. Also in April, the ''Peacock'' surveyed the [[Gilbert Islands]] of [[Nonouti]], [[Aranuka]], [[Maiana]], [[Abemama]], [[Kuria (islands)|Kuria]], [[Tarawa]], [[Marakei]], [[Butaritari]], and [[Makin (islands)|Makin]], before returning to Ohau on June 13. The ''Peacock'' and ''Flying Fish'' then left for the [[Columbia River]] on June 21.{{sfn|Stanton|1975|pp=212, 217, 219\u2013221, 224\u2013237, 240, 245\u2013246}}\n\nIn April 1841, USS ''Peacock'', under Lieutenant [[William L. Hudson]], and USS ''Flying Fish'', surveyed [[Tabiteuea|Drummond's Island]], which was named for an American of the expedition. Lieutenant Hudson heard from a member of his crew that a ship had wrecked off the island and her crew massacred by the [[Gilbert Islands|Gilbertese]]. A woman and her child were said to be the only survivors, so Hudson decided to land a small force of marines and sailors, under [[William M. Walker]], to search the island. Initially, the natives were peaceful and the Americans were able to explore the island, without results. It was when the party was returning to their ship that Hudson noticed a member of his crew was missing.\n\n[[File:Map of the Oregon Territory by the U. S. Ex. Ex.png|thumb|upright=1.75|left|An 1841 map of the [[Oregon Territory]]. ''Narrative of the United States Exploring Expedition''.]]\nAfter making another search, the man was not found and the natives began arming themselves. Lieutenant Walker returned his force to the ship, to converse with Hudson, who ordered Walker to return to shore and demand the return of the sailor. Walker then reboarded his boats with his landing party and headed to shore. Walker shouted his demand and the natives charged for him, forcing the boats to turn back to the ships. It was decided on the next day that the Americans would [[Battle of Drummond's Island|bombard]] the hostiles and land again. While doing this, a force of around 700 Gilbertese warriors opposed the American assault, but were defeated after a long battle. No Americans were hurt, but twelve natives were killed and others were wounded, and two villages were also destroyed. A similar episode occurred two months before in February when the ''Peacock'' and the ''Flying Fish'' briefly [[Bombardment of Upolu|bombarded]] the island of [[Upolu]], Samoa following the death of an American merchant sailor on the island.{{sfn|Ellsworth|1974|pp=172\u2013174}}\n\nThe ''Vincennes'' and ''Porpoise'' reached [[Cape Disappointment (Washington)|Cape Disappointment]] on April 28, 1841, but then headed north to the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]], [[Port Discovery, Washington|Port Discovery]], and [[Fort Nisqually]], where they were welcomed by [[William Henry McNeill]] and [[Alexander Caulfield Anderson]]. The ''Porpoise'' surveyed the [[Admiralty Inlet]], while boats from the ''Vincennes'' surveyed [[Hood Canal]], and the coast northwards to the [[Fraser River]]. Wilkes visited [[Fort Clatsop]], [[John McLoughlin]] at [[Fort Vancouver]], and [[William Cannon (pioneer)|William Cannon]] on the [[Willamette River]], while he sent Lt. Johnson on an expedition to [[Fort Okanogan]], [[Fort Colvile]] and [[Fort Nez Perces]], where they met [[Marcus Whitman]].{{sfn|Stanton|1975|pp=253\u2013256}} Like his predecessor, [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] explorer [[George Vancouver]], Wilkes spent a good deal of time near [[Bainbridge Island]]. He noted the bird-like shape of the harbor at [[Winslow, Washington|Winslow]] and named it [[Eagle Harbor (harbor)|Eagle Harbor]]. Continuing his fascination with bird names, he named Bill Point and Wing Point. [[Port Madison, Washington]] and Points Monroe and Jefferson were named in honor of former United States presidents. [[Port Ludlow, Washington|Port Ludlow]] was assigned to honor Lieutenant [[Augustus Ludlow]], who lost his life during the [[War of 1812]].\n\nThe ''Peacock'' and ''Flying Fish'' arrived off Cape Disappointment on July 17. However, the ''Peacock'' went [[aground]] while attempting to enter the Columbia River and was soon lost, though with no loss of life. The crew was able to lower six boats and get everyone into Baker's Bay, along with their journals, surveys, the chronometers, and some of Agate's sketches. A one-eyed Indian named George then guided the ''Flying Fish'' into the same bay.\n\n[[File:Peruvian Andes2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''\"Andes near Alparmarca, Peru: Sketched from an Elevation of 16,000 Feet\"'' \u2013 [[Alfred Agate]]]]\nThere, the crew set up \"Peacockville\", assisted by [[James Birnie]] of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], and the American Methodist Mission at Point Adams. They also traded with the local [[Clatsop]] and [[Chinookan]] Indians over the next three weeks, while surveying the channel, before journeying to [[Fort Astoria|Fort George]] and a reunion with the rest of the squadron. This prompted Wilkes to send the ''Vincennes'' to San Francisco Bay, while he continued to survey [[Grays Harbor]].{{sfn|Stanton|1975|pp=247\u2013253, 259}}\n\nFrom the area of modern-day [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], Wilkes sent an overland party of 39 southwards, led by Emmons, but guided by [[Joseph Meek]]. The group included Agate, Eld, Colvocoresses, Brackenridge, Rich, Peale, Stearns, and Dana, and proceeded along an inland route to [[Fort Umpqua]], [[Mount Shasta]], the [[Sacramento River]], [[John Sutter]]'s [[New Helvetia]], and then onwards to [[San Francisco Bay]]. They departed September 7, and arrived aboard the ''Vincennes'' in [[Sausalito]] on October 23, having traveled along the [[Siskiyou Trail]].{{sfn|Stanton|1975|pp=259\u2013265}}\n\nWilkes arrived with the ''Porpoise'' and ''Oregon'', while the ''Flying Fish'' was to rendezvous with the squadron in Honolulu.{{sfn|Stanton|1975|p=267}} The squadron surveyed San Francisco and its tributaries, and later produced a map of \"Upper California\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bcn.boulder.co.us/basin/ditchproject/?Maps:Map_of_the_Upper_California%2C_1841:Explore_the_Map_of_the_Upper_California|title=Map of \"Upper California\"|publisher=|accessdate=February 18, 2018}}</ref> The expedition then headed back out on October 31, arriving Honolulu on November 17, and departing on November 28.{{sfn|Stanton|1975|pp=269\u2013272}} They included a visit to [[Wake Island]], and returned by way of the [[Philippines]], [[Borneo]], [[Singapore]], [[Polynesia]], and the [[Cape of Good Hope]], reaching New York on June 10, 1842.\n\nThe expedition was plagued by poor relationships between Wilkes and his subordinate officers throughout. Wilkes' self-proclaimed status as captain and commodore, accompanied by the flying of the requisite pennant and the wearing of a captain's uniform while being commissioned only as a Lieutenant, rankled heavily with other members of the expedition of similar real rank. His apparent mistreatment of many of his subordinates, and indulgence in punishments such as \"[[Cat o' nine tails#Flogging round the fleet|flogging round the fleet]]\" resulted in a major controversy on his return to America.<ref name=\"glory\">[[Nathaniel Philbrick|Philbrick, N.]], ''Sea of Glory'', Viking, 2003</ref>{{sfn|Stanton|1975|pp=219\u2013220}} Wilkes was [[court-martial]]led on his return, but was acquitted on all charges except that of illegally punishing men in his squadron.\n\n== Significance ==\nThe Wilkes Expedition played a major role in the development of 19th-century science, particularly in the growth of the American scientific establishment. Many of the species and other items found by the expedition helped form the basis of collections at the new [[Smithsonian Institution]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Adler|first=Antony|date=6 October 2010|title=From the Pacific to the Patent Office: The US Exploring Expedition and the origins of America's first national museum|url=http://jhc.oxfordjournals.org/content/23/1/49.abstract|journal=Journal of the History of Collections|volume=|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Nukufetauman1831.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nukufetau]] man by [[Alfred Agate]], 1841]]\nWith the help of the expedition's scientists, derisively called \"''clam digger''s\" and \"''bug catchers''\" by navy crew members, 280 islands, mostly in the Pacific, were explored, and over 800 miles of [[Oregon]] were mapped. Of no less importance, over 60,000 plant and bird specimens were collected. A staggering amount of data and specimens were collected during the expedition, including the seeds of 648 species, which were later traded, planted, and sent throughout the country. Dried specimens were sent to the [[United States National Herbarium|National Herbarium]], now a part of the Smithsonian Institution. There were also 254 live plants, which mostly came from the home stretch of the journey, that were placed in a newly constructed greenhouse in 1850, which later became the [[United States Botanic Garden]].\n\n[[Alfred Thomas Agate]], engraver and illustrator, created an enduring record of traditional cultures such as the illustrations made of the dress and tattoo patterns of natives of the [[Ellice Islands]] (now [[Tuvalu]]).<ref>'Follow the Expedition', Volume 5, Chapter 2, pp. 35\u201375, 'Ellice's and Kingsmill's Group', http://www.sil.si.edu/DigitalCollections/usexex/</ref>\n\nA collection of artifacts from the expedition also went to the [[National Institute for the Promotion of Science]], a precursor of the Smithsonian Institution.

Other contributions were three reports by [[James Dwight Dana]] on ''Zoophytes'', ''Geology'', and ''Crustacea''. In addition to shorter articles and reports, Wilkes published ''Western America, including California and Oregon'',<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|first=C.|last=Wilkes|title=Western America, including California and Oregon|year=1849|publisher=Lea and Blanchard|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9781297717482|url=https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/006568406}}</ref> and ''Theory of the Winds''. The [[Smithsonian Institution]] digitized the five volume narrative and the accompanying scientific volumes. The mismanagement that plagued the expedition prior to its departure continued after its completion. By June 1848, many of the specimens had been lost or damaged and many remained unidentified. [[Asa Gray]] was hired to work on the botanical specimens.{{sfn|Dupree|1988|pp=185\u2013195}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*{{cite book\n | ref        = harv\n | last       = Bagley\n | first      = C.

The original appointed commanding officer was [[Commodore (USN)#History|Commodore]] [[Thomas ap Catesby Jones]]. Funding for the original expedition was requested by President [[John Quincy Adams]] in 1828, however, Congress would not implement funding until eight years later. In May 1836, the oceanic exploration voyage was finally authorized by [[United States Congress|Congress]] and created by President [[Andrew Jackson]].\n\nThe expedition is sometimes called the \"U.S. Ex.&nbsp;Ex.\" for short, or the \"Wilkes Expedition\" in honor of its next appointed commanding officer, [[United States Navy]] Lieutenant [[Charles Wilkes]]. The expedition was of major importance to the growth of science in the United States, in particular the then-young field of [[oceanography]]. During the event, armed conflict between Pacific islanders and the expedition was common and dozens of natives were killed in action, as well as a few Americans.\n\n== Preparations ==\nThrough the [[lobbying in the United States|lobbying efforts]] of [[Jeremiah N. Reynolds]], the [[United States House of Representatives]] passed a resolution on May 21, 1828, requesting President [[John Quincy Adams]] to send a ship to explore the Pacific. Adams was keen on the resolution and ordered his [[Secretary of the Navy]] to ready a ship, the [[USS Peacock (1813)|''Peacock'']], while the House voted an [[appropriation (law)|appropriation]] in December Yet, the bill stalled in the [[US Senate]] in February 1829. However, under President [[Andrew Jackson]], Congress passed legislation in 1836 approving the exploration mission. Yet again, the effort stalled under Secretary of the Navy [[Mahlon Dickerson]] until President [[Van Buren]] assumed office and pushed the effort forward.{{sfn|Stanton|1975|pp=13\u201317}}{{sfn|Dupree|1988|pp=59\u201365}}\n\nOriginally, the expedition was under the command [[Thomas ap Catesby Jones|Commodore Jones]], but he resigned in November 1837, frustrated with all of the procrastination. [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Joel Roberts Poinsett]], in April 1838, then assigned command to Wilkes, after more senior officers refused the command. Wilkes had a reputation for [[hydrography]], [[geodesy]], and [[magnetism]]. Additionally, Wilkes had received mathematics training from [[Nathaniel Bowditch]], [[triangulation]] methods from [[Ferdinand Hassler]], and [[geomagnetism]] from [[James Renwick (physicist)|James Renwick]].{{sfn|Stanton|1975|pp=19, 35, 56\u201361}}\n\nPersonnel included [[Natural history|naturalist]]s, [[botanist]]s, a [[mineralogist]], a [[taxidermist]], and a [[philologist]]. They were carried aboard the [[sloop-of-war|sloops-of-war]] {{USS|Vincennes|1826|6}} (780&nbsp;tons), and {{USS|Peacock|1828|6}} (650&nbsp;tons), the [[brig]] {{USS|Porpoise|1836|6}} (230&nbsp;tons), the [[full-rigged ship]] [[USS Relief (1836)|''Relief'']], which served as a [[auxiliary ship|store-ship]], and two [[schooner]]s, [[USS Sea Gull (1838)|''Sea Gull'']] (110&nbsp;tons) and {{USS |Flying Fish|1838|6}} (96&nbsp;tons), which served as [[ship's tender|tender]]s.{{sfn|Stanton|1975|pp=43, 63\u201368, 73\u201376}}\n\nOn the afternoon of August 18, 1838, the vessels weighed anchor and set to sea under full sail. By 0730 the next morning, they had passed the [[List of lightships of the United States|lightship]] off [[Willoughby Spit]] and discharged the [[maritime pilot|pilot]]. The fleet then headed to [[Madeira]], taking advantage of the prevailing winds.{{sfn|Stanton|1975|pp=71\u201376}}\n\nCoincidentally, [[Commodore (United States)|Commodore]] [[George C.

The squadron arrived in the [[Madeira Islands]] on September 16, 1838, and [[Porto Praya]] on October 6.{{sfn|Stanton|1975|pp=86\u201387}} The ''Peacock'' arrived at Rio de Janeiro on November 21, and the ''Vincennes'' with brigs and schooners on November 24. However, the ''Relief'' did not arrive until the November 27, setting a record for slowness, 100 days. While there, they used Enxados Island in [[Guanabara Bay]] for an observatory and naval yard for repair and refitting.{{sfn|Stanton|1975|pp=88\u201389}}\n\n[[File:Charles wilkes part1.png|thumb|left|upright=1.75|Voyage route:&nbsp;1.&nbsp;[[Hampton Roads]]&nbsp;\u2013 2.&nbsp;[[Madeira]]&nbsp;\u2013 3.&nbsp;[[Rio de Janeiro]]&nbsp;\u2013 4.&nbsp;[[Tierra del Fuego]]&nbsp;\u2013 5.&nbsp;[[Valpara\u00edso]]&nbsp;\u2013 6.&nbsp;[[Callao]]&nbsp;\u2013 7.&nbsp;[[Tahiti]]&nbsp;\u2013 8.&nbsp;[[Samoa]]&nbsp;\u2013 9.&nbsp;[[Sydney]]&nbsp;\u2013 10.&nbsp;[[Antarctica]]&nbsp;\u2013 11.&nbsp;[[Hawaiian Islands|Sandwich Islands (via Fiji)]]]]\nThe Squadron did not leave Rio de Janeiro until January 6, 1839, arriving at the mouth of the [[R\u00edo Negro (Argentina)|R\u00edo Negro]] on January 25. On February 19, the squadron joined the ''Relief'', ''Flying Fish'', and ''Sea Gull'' in Orange Harbor, [[Hoste Island]], after passing through [[Le Maire Strait]]. While there, the expedition came in contact with the [[Fuegians]]. Wilkes sent an expedition south in an attempt to exceed [[Captain Cook]]'s farthest point south, 71\u00b010'.\n\nThe ''Flying Fish'' reached 70\u00b0 on March 22, in the area about 100 miles north of [[Thurston Island]], and what is now called [[Cape Flying Fish]], and the [[Walker Mountains]]. The squadron joined the ''Peacock'' in [[Valparaiso]] on May 10, but the ''Sea Gull'' was reported missing. On June 6, the squadron arrived [[San Lorenzo Island (Peru)|San Lorenzo]], off [[Callao]] for repair and provisioning, while Wilkes dispatched the ''Relief'' homewards on June 21.{{sfn|Stanton|1975|pp=91\u201396, 103\u2013111}} Leaving South America on July 12, the expedition reached [[Reao]] of the [[Tuamotu]] Group on August 13, and [[Tahiti]] on September 11. They departed Tahiti on October 10.{{sfn|Stanton|1975|pp=114\u2013116, 123\u2013131}}\n\nThe expedition then visited [[Samoa]] and [[New South Wales]], Australia. In December 1839, the expedition sailed from Sydney into the [[Antarctic Ocean]] and reported the discovery of the [[Antarctica|Antarctic continent]] on January 16, 1840, when [[Henry Eld]] and [[William Reynolds (naval officer)|William Reynolds]] aboard the ''Peacock'' sighted [[Eld Peak]] and [[Reynolds Peak]] along the [[George V Coast]]. On the January 19, Reynolds spotted [[Cape Hudson]]. On January 25, the ''Vincennes'' sighted the mountains behind the [[Cook Ice Shelf]], similar peaks at [[Piner Bay]] on January 30, and had covered 800 miles of coastline by February 12, from 140\u00b0 30' E. to 112\u00b0 16' 12\"E., when Wilkes acknowledged they had \"discovered the Antarctic Continent.\" Named [[Wilkes Land]], it includes [[Claire Land]], [[Banzare Land]], [[Sabrina Land]], [[Budd Land]], and [[Knox Land]]. They charted 1500 miles of Antarctic coastline{{sfn|Philbrick|2003|p= [https://archive.org/details/seaofgloryameric00phil/page/n21 xix]}} to a westward goal of 105\u00b0 E., the edge of [[Queen Mary Land]], before departing to the north again on February 21.{{sfn|Stanton|1975|pp=132, 142\u2013149, 155\u2013159, 171\u2013175}}\n\nThe ''Porpoise'' came across the French expedition of [[Jules Dumont d'Urville]] on January 30. However, due to a misunderstanding of each other's intentions, the Porpoise and [[French ship Astrolabe (1811)|Astrolabe]] were unable to communicate.{{sfn|Stanton|1975|pp=176\u2013177}} In February 1840, some of the expedition were present at the initial signing of the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] in New Zealand.{{sfn|Wilkes|1845|p=376}} Some of the squadron then proceeded back to Sydney for repairs, while the rest visited the [[Bay of Islands]], before arriving in [[Tonga]] in April. At [[Nuku'alofa]] the met King Josiah (Aleamotu'a), and the George (Taufa'ahau), chief of [[Ha'apai]], before proceeding onwards to [[Fiji]] on May 4. The ''Porpoise'' surveyed the Low Archipelago, while the ''Vincennes'' and ''Peacock'' proceeded onwards to [[Ovalau (Fiji)|Ovalau]], where they signed a commercial treaty with [[Tanoa Visawaqa]] in [[Levuka]]. [[Edward Belcher]]'s {{HMS|Starling|1829|6}} visited Ovalau at the same time.{{sfn|Stanton|1975|pp=180\u2013195}} Hudson was able to capture Vendovi, after holding his brothers Cocanauto, Qaraniqio, and Tui Dreketi ([[Roko Tui Dreketi]] or King of [[Rewa Province]]) hostage. Vendovi was deemed responsible for the attack against US sailors on [[Ono Island (Fiji)|Ono Island]] in 1836. Vendovi was to be taken back to the US after a brief trial on board.{{sfn|Stanton|1975|pp=199\u2013201}}\n\nIn July 1840, two members of the party, Lieutenant Underwood and Wilkes' nephew, [[Midshipman]] Wilkes Henry, were killed while bartering for food in western [[Fiji]]'s [[Malolo]] Island. The cause of this event remains equivocal. Immediately prior to their deaths, the son of the local chief, who was being held as a hostage by the Americans, escaped by jumping out of the boat and running through the shallow water for shore. The Americans fired over his head. According to members of the expedition party on the boat, his escape was intended as a prearranged signal by the Fijians to attack. According to those on shore, the shooting actually precipitated the attack on the ground. The Americans landed sixty sailors to attack the hostile natives. Close to eighty Fijians were killed in the resulting American reprisal and two villages were burned to the ground.{{sfn|Philbrick|2003}}\n\n=== Return route ===\n[[File:Charles Wilkes part2.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Return route:&nbsp;1.&nbsp;[[Puget Sound]]&nbsp;\u2013 2.&nbsp;[[Columbia River]]&nbsp;\u2013 3.&nbsp;[[San&nbsp;Francisco]]&nbsp;\u2013 4.&nbsp;[[Polynesia]]&nbsp;\u2013 5.&nbsp;[[Philippines]]&nbsp;\u2013 6.&nbsp;[[Borneo]]&nbsp;\u2013 7.&nbsp;[[Singapore]]&nbsp;\u2013 8.&nbsp;[[Cape of Good Hope]]&nbsp;\u2013 9.&nbsp;[[New York City|New York]]]]\nOn August 9, after three months of surveying, the squadron met off [[Macuata]]. The ''Vincennes'' and ''Peacock'' proceeded onwards to the Sandwich Islands, with the ''Flying Fish'' and ''Porpoise'' to meet them in [[Oahu]] by October. Along the way, Wilkes named the [[Phoenix Islands|Phoenix Group]] and made a stop at the [[Palmyra Atoll]], making their group the first scientific expedition in history to visit Palmyra.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wilkes |first1=Charles |title=Excerpt from United States Exploring Expedition, Vol XXIII |url=http://www.palmyraarchive.org/items/show/58 |website=Palmyra Atoll Digital Archive}}</ref> While in Hawaii, the officers were welcomed by Governor [[Kekuanaoa]], King [[Kamehameha III]], his aide [[William Richards (Hawaii)|William Richards]], and the journalist [[James Jackson Jarves]]. The expedition surveyed [[Kauai]], Oahu, Hawaii, and the peak of [[Mauna Loa]]. The ''Porpoise'' was dispatched in November to survey several of the [[Tuamotu]]s, including [[Aratika]], [[Kauehi]], [[Raraka]], and [[Katiu]], before proceeding onwards to [[Penrhyn (atoll)|Penrhyn]] and returning to Oahu on 24 March.\n\nOn April 5, 1841, the squadron departed Honolulu, the ''Porpoise'' and ''Vincennes'' for the Pacific Northwest, the ''Peacock'' and ''Flying Fish'' to resurvey Samoa, before rejoining the squadron. Along the way, the ''Peacock'' and ''Flying Fish'' surveyed [[Jarvis Island]], [[Enderbury Island]], the [[Tokelau]] Islands, and [[Fakaofo]]. The ''Peacock'' followed this with surveys of the [[Tuvalu]] islands of [[Nukufetau]], [[Vaitupu]], and [[Nanumanga]] in March, followed by [[Tabiteuea]] in April. Also in April, the ''Peacock'' surveyed the [[Gilbert Islands]] of [[Nonouti]], [[Aranuka]], [[Maiana]], [[Abemama]], [[Kuria (islands)|Kuria]], [[Tarawa]], [[Marakei]], [[Butaritari]], and [[Makin (islands)|Makin]], before returning to Ohau on June 13. The ''Peacock'' and ''Flying Fish'' then left for the [[Columbia River]] on June 21.{{sfn|Stanton|1975|pp=212, 217, 219\u2013221, 224\u2013237, 240, 245\u2013246}}\n\nIn April 1841, USS ''Peacock'', under Lieutenant [[William L. Hudson]], and USS ''Flying Fish'', surveyed [[Tabiteuea|Drummond's Island]], which was named for an American of the expedition. Lieutenant Hudson heard from a member of his crew that a ship had wrecked off the island and her crew massacred by the [[Gilbert Islands|Gilbertese]]. A woman and her child were said to be the only survivors, so Hudson decided to land a small force of marines and sailors, under [[William M. Walker]], to search the island. Initially, the natives were peaceful and the Americans were able to explore the island, without results. It was when the party was returning to their ship that Hudson noticed a member of his crew was missing.\n\n[[File:Map of the Oregon Territory by the U. S. Ex. Ex.png|thumb|upright=1.75|left|An 1841 map of the [[Oregon Territory]]. ''Narrative of the United States Exploring Expedition''.]]\nAfter making another search, the man was not found and the natives began arming themselves. Lieutenant Walker returned his force to the ship, to converse with Hudson, who ordered Walker to return to shore and demand the return of the sailor. Walker then reboarded his boats with his landing party and headed to shore. Walker shouted his demand and the natives charged for him, forcing the boats to turn back to the ships. It was decided on the next day that the Americans would [[Battle of Drummond's Island|bombard]] the hostiles and land again. While doing this, a force of around 700 Gilbertese warriors opposed the American assault, but were defeated after a long battle. No Americans were hurt, but twelve natives were killed and others were wounded, and two villages were also destroyed. A similar episode occurred two months before in February when the ''Peacock'' and the ''Flying Fish'' briefly [[Bombardment of Upolu|bombarded]] the island of [[Upolu]], Samoa following the death of an American merchant sailor on the island.{{sfn|Ellsworth|1974|pp=172\u2013174}}\n\nThe ''Vincennes'' and ''Porpoise'' reached [[Cape Disappointment (Washington)|Cape Disappointment]] on April 28, 1841, but then headed north to the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]], [[Port Discovery, Washington|Port Discovery]], and [[Fort Nisqually]], where they were welcomed by [[William Henry McNeill]] and [[Alexander Caulfield Anderson]]. The ''Porpoise'' surveyed the [[Admiralty Inlet]], while boats from the ''Vincennes'' surveyed [[Hood Canal]], and the coast northwards to the [[Fraser River]]. Wilkes visited [[Fort Clatsop]], [[John McLoughlin]] at [[Fort Vancouver]], and [[William Cannon (pioneer)|William Cannon]] on the [[Willamette River]], while he sent Lt. Johnson on an expedition to [[Fort Okanogan]], [[Fort Colvile]] and [[Fort Nez Perces]], where they met [[Marcus Whitman]].{{sfn|Stanton|1975|pp=253\u2013256}} Like his predecessor, [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] explorer [[George Vancouver]], Wilkes spent a good deal of time near [[Bainbridge Island]]. He noted the bird-like shape of the harbor at [[Winslow, Washington|Winslow]] and named it [[Eagle Harbor (harbor)|Eagle Harbor]]. Continuing his fascination with bird names, he named Bill Point and Wing Point. [[Port Madison, Washington]] and Points Monroe and Jefferson were named in honor of former United States presidents. [[Port Ludlow, Washington|Port Ludlow]] was assigned to honor Lieutenant [[Augustus Ludlow]], who lost his life during the [[War of 1812]].\n\nThe ''Peacock'' and ''Flying Fish'' arrived off Cape Disappointment on July 17. However, the ''Peacock'' went [[aground]] while attempting to enter the Columbia River and was soon lost, though with no loss of life. The crew was able to lower six boats and get everyone into Baker's Bay, along with their journals, surveys, the chronometers, and some of Agate's sketches. A one-eyed Indian named George then guided the ''Flying Fish'' into the same bay.\n\n[[File:Peruvian Andes2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''\"Andes near Alparmarca, Peru: Sketched from an Elevation of 16,000 Feet\"'' \u2013 [[Alfred Agate]]]]\nThere, the crew set up \"Peacockville\", assisted by [[James Birnie]] of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], and the American Methodist Mission at Point Adams. They also traded with the local [[Clatsop]] and [[Chinookan]] Indians over the next three weeks, while surveying the channel, before journeying to [[Fort Astoria|Fort George]] and a reunion with the rest of the squadron. This prompted Wilkes to send the ''Vincennes'' to San Francisco Bay, while he continued to survey [[Grays Harbor]].{{sfn|Stanton|1975|pp=247\u2013253, 259}}\n\nFrom the area of modern-day [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], Wilkes sent an overland party of 39 southwards, led by Emmons, but guided by [[Joseph Meek]]. The group included Agate, Eld, Colvocoresses, Brackenridge, Rich, Peale, Stearns, and Dana, and proceeded along an inland route to [[Fort Umpqua]], [[Mount Shasta]], the [[Sacramento River]], [[John Sutter]]'s [[New Helvetia]], and then onwards to [[San Francisco Bay]]. They departed September 7, and arrived aboard the ''Vincennes'' in [[Sausalito]] on October 23, having traveled along the [[Siskiyou Trail]].{{sfn|Stanton|1975|pp=259\u2013265}}\n\nWilkes arrived with the ''Porpoise'' and ''Oregon'', while the ''Flying Fish'' was to rendezvous with the squadron in Honolulu.{{sfn|Stanton|1975|p=267}} The squadron surveyed San Francisco and its tributaries, and later produced a map of \"Upper California\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bcn.boulder.co.us/basin/ditchproject/?Maps:Map_of_the_Upper_California%2C_1841:Explore_the_Map_of_the_Upper_California|title=Map of \"Upper California\"|publisher=|accessdate=February 18, 2018}}</ref> The expedition then headed back out on October 31, arriving Honolulu on November 17, and departing on November 28.{{sfn|Stanton|1975|pp=269\u2013272}} They included a visit to [[Wake Island]], and returned by way of the [[Philippines]], [[Borneo]], [[Singapore]], [[Polynesia]], and the [[Cape of Good Hope]], reaching New York on June 10, 1842.\n\nThe expedition was plagued by poor relationships between Wilkes and his subordinate officers throughout. Wilkes' self-proclaimed status as captain and commodore, accompanied by the flying of the requisite pennant and the wearing of a captain's uniform while being commissioned only as a Lieutenant, rankled heavily with other members of the expedition of similar real rank. His apparent mistreatment of many of his subordinates, and indulgence in punishments such as \"[[Cat o' nine tails#Flogging round the fleet|flogging round the fleet]]\" resulted in a major controversy on his return to America.<ref name=\"glory\">[[Nathaniel Philbrick|Philbrick, N.]], ''Sea of Glory'', Viking, 2003</ref>{{sfn|Stanton|1975|pp=219\u2013220}} Wilkes was [[court-martial]]led on his return, but was acquitted on all charges except that of illegally punishing men in his squadron.\n\n== Significance ==\nThe Wilkes Expedition played a major role in the development of 19th-century science, particularly in the growth of the American scientific establishment. Many of the species and other items found by the expedition helped form the basis of collections at the new [[Smithsonian Institution]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Adler|first=Antony|date=6 October 2010|title=From the Pacific to the Patent Office: The US Exploring Expedition and the origins of America's first national museum|url=http://jhc.oxfordjournals.org/content/23/1/49.abstract|journal=Journal of the History of Collections|volume=|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Nukufetauman1831.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nukufetau]] man by [[Alfred Agate]], 1841]]\nWith the help of the expedition's scientists, derisively called \"''clam digger''s\" and \"''bug catchers''\" by navy crew members, 280 islands, mostly in the Pacific, were explored, and over 800 miles of [[Oregon]] were mapped. Of no less importance, over 60,000 plant and bird specimens were collected. A staggering amount of data and specimens were collected during the expedition, including the seeds of 648 species, which were later traded, planted, and sent throughout the country. Dried specimens were sent to the [[United States National Herbarium|National Herbarium]], now a part of the Smithsonian Institution. There were also 254 live plants, which mostly came from the home stretch of the journey, that were placed in a newly constructed greenhouse in 1850, which later became the [[United States Botanic Garden]].\n\n[[Alfred Thomas Agate]], engraver and illustrator, created an enduring record of traditional cultures such as the illustrations made of the dress and tattoo patterns of natives of the [[Ellice Islands]] (now [[Tuvalu]]).<ref>'Follow the Expedition', Volume 5, Chapter 2, pp. 35\u201375, 'Ellice's and Kingsmill's Group', http://www.sil.si.edu/DigitalCollections/usexex/</ref>\n\nA collection of artifacts from the expedition also went to the [[National Institute for the Promotion of Science]], a precursor of the Smithsonian Institution.

Other contributions were three reports by [[James Dwight Dana]] on ''Zoophytes'', ''Geology'', and ''Crustacea''. In addition to shorter articles and reports, Wilkes published ''Western America, including California and Oregon'',<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|first=C.|last=Wilkes|title=Western America, including California and Oregon|year=1849|publisher=Lea and Blanchard|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9781297717482|url=https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/006568406}}</ref> and ''Theory of the Winds''. The [[Smithsonian Institution]] digitized the five volume narrative and the accompanying scientific volumes. The mismanagement that plagued the expedition prior to its departure continued after its completion. By June 1848, many of the specimens had been lost or damaged and many remained unidentified.
