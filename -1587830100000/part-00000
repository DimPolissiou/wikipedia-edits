population census since 1964. It was by far the most thorough and accurate census taken since 1949 and confirmed that China was a nation of more than 1 billion people, or about one-fifth of the world's population. The census provided demographers with a set of data on China's age-sex structure, fertility and mortality rates, and population density and distribution. Information was also gathered on minority ethnic groups, urban population, and marital status. For the first time since the People's Republic of China was founded, demographers had reliable information on the size and composition of the Chinese work force. The nation began preparing for the 1982 census in late 1976. Chinese census workers were sent to the United States and Japan to study modern census-taking techniques and automation. Computers were installed in every provincial-level unit except Tibet and were connected to a central processing system in the Beijing headquarters of the [[National Bureau of Statistics of the People's Republic of China|State Statistical Bureau]]. Pretests and small scale trial runs were conducted and checked for accuracy between 1980 and 1981 in twenty-four provincial-level units. Census stations were opened in rural [[production brigade]]s and urban neighborhoods. Beginning on 1 July 1982, each household sent a representative to a census station to be enumerated. The census required about a month to complete and employed approximately 5 million census takers.\n\nThe 1982 census collected data in nineteen demographic categories relating to individuals and households. The thirteen areas concerning individuals were name, relationship to head of household, sex, age, nationality, registration status, educational level, profession, occupation, status of nonworking persons, marital status, number of children born and still living, and number of births in 1981. The six items pertaining to households were type (domestic or collective), serial number, number of persons, number of births in 1981, number of deaths in 1981, and number of registered persons absent for more than one year. Information was gathered in a number of important areas for which previous data were either extremely inaccurate or simply nonexistent, including fertility, marital status, urban population, minority ethnic groups, sex composition, age distribution, and employment and unemployment.\n\nA fundamental anomaly in the 1982 statistics was noted by some Western analysts. They pointed out that although the birth and death rates recorded by the census and those recorded through the household registration system were different, the two systems arrived at similar population totals. The discrepancies in the vital rates were the result of the underreporting of both births and deaths to the authorities under the registration system; families would not report some births because of the one-child policy and would not report some deaths so as to hold on to the rations of the deceased.\n\nNevertheless, the 1982 census was a watershed for both Chinese and world demographics. After an eighteen-year gap, population specialists were given a wealth of reliable, up-to-date figures on which to reconstruct past demographic patterns, measure current population conditions, and predict future population trends. For example, Chinese and foreign demographers used the 1982 census age-sex structure as the base population for forecasting and making assumptions about future fertility trends. The data on age-specific [[fertility]] and [[mortality rate]]s provided the necessary base-line information for making population projections. The census data also were useful for estimating future [[Human resources|manpower]] potential, [[consumer needs]], and [[utility]], energy, and health-service requirements. The sudden abundance of demographic data helped population specialists immeasurably in their efforts to estimate world population. Previously, there had been no accurate information on these 21% of the Earth's inhabitants. Demographers who had been conducting research on global population without accurate data on the Chinese fifth of the world's population were particularly thankful for the 1982 breakthrough census.\n\n===Population control===\n{{See also|One-child policy|Two-child policy}}\n[[File:Birth rate in China.svg|450px|thumbnail|right|Birth rate in China]]\nInitially, China's post-1949 leaders were ideologically disposed to view a large population as an asset. But the liabilities of a large, rapidly growing population soon became apparent. For one year, starting in August 1956, vigorous support was given to the Ministry of Public Health's mass [[birth control]] efforts. These efforts, however, had little impact on fertility. After the interval of the [[Great Leap Forward]], Chinese leaders again saw rapid population growth as an obstacle to development, and their interest in birth control revived. In the early 1960s, schemes somewhat more muted than during the first campaign, emphasized the virtues of late marriage. Birth control offices were set up in the central government and some provincial-level governments in 1964. The second campaign was particularly successful in the cities, where the birth rate was cut in half during the 1963\u201366 period. The upheaval of the [[Cultural Revolution]] brought the program to a halt, however.\n\nIn 1972 and 1973 the party mobilized its resources for a nationwide birth control campaign administered by a group in the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]]. Committees to oversee birth control activities were established at all administrative levels and in various collective enterprises. This extensive and seemingly effective network covered both the rural and the urban population. In urban areas public security headquarters included population control sections. In rural areas the country's \"[[barefoot doctor]]s\" distributed information and contraceptives to [[people's commune]] members. By 1973 [[Mao Zedong]] was personally identified with the family planning movement, signifying a greater leadership commitment to controlled population growth than ever before. Yet until several years after Mao's death in 1976, the leadership was reluctant to put forth directly the rationale that population control was necessary for economic growth and improved [[living standards]].\n\nPopulation growth targets were set for both administrative units and individual families. In the mid-1970s the maximum recommended family size was two children in cities and three or four in the country. Since 1979 the government has advocated a one-child limit for both rural and urban areas and has generally set a maximum of two children in special circumstances. As of 1986 the policy for minority nationalities was two children per couple, three in special circumstances, and no limit for ethnic groups with very small populations. The overall goal of the one-child policy was to keep the total population within 1.2&nbsp;billion through the year 2000, on the premise that the [[Four Modernizations]] program would be of little value if population growth was not brought under control.\n\nThe one-child policy was a highly ambitious population control program. Like previous programs of the 1960s and 1970s, the one-child policy employed a combination of public education, social pressure, and in some cases coercion. The one-child policy was unique, however, in that it linked reproduction with economic cost or benefit.\n\nUnder the one-child program, a sophisticated system rewarded those who observed the policy and penalized those who did not. Through this policy, the increasing population got temperate after the penalties were made. Couples with only one child were given a \"one-child certificate\" entitling them to such benefits as cash bonuses, longer [[maternity leave]], better [[child care]], and preferential housing assignments. In return, they were required to pledge that they would not have more children. In the countryside, there was great pressure to adhere to the one-child limit. Because the rural population accounted for approximately 60% of the total, the effectiveness of the one-child policy in rural areas was considered the key to the success or failure of the program as a whole.\n\nIn rural areas the day-to-day work of family planning was done by [[Professional revolutionaries|cadres]] at the team and brigade levels who were responsible for women's affairs and by health workers. The women's team leader made regular household visits to keep track of the status of each family under her jurisdiction and collected information on which women were using [[contraceptives]], the methods used, and which had become pregnant. She then reported to the brigade women's leader, who documented the information and took it to a monthly meeting of the commune birth-planning committee. According to reports, ceilings or quotas had to be adhered to; to satisfy these cutoffs, unmarried young people were persuaded to postpone marriage, couples without children were advised to \"wait their turn,\" women with unauthorized pregnancies were pressured to have abortions, and those who already had children were urged to use [[contraception]] or undergo [[Compulsory sterilization|sterilization]]. Couples with more than one child were exhorted to be sterilized.\n\nThe one-child policy enjoyed much greater success in urban than in rural areas. Even without state intervention, there were compelling reasons for urban couples to limit the family to a single child. Raising a child required a significant portion of family income, and in the cities a child did not become an economic asset until he or she entered the work force at age sixteen. Couples with only one child were given preferential treatment in housing allocation. In addition, because city dwellers who were employed in state enterprises received pensions after retirement, the sex of their first child was less important to them than it was to those in rural areas.\n\nNumerous reports surfaced of coercive measures used to achieve the desired results of the one-child policy. The alleged methods ranged from intense psychological pressure to the use of physical force, including some grisly accounts of forced abortions and infanticide. Chinese officials admitted that isolated, uncondoned abuses of the program occurred and that they condemned such acts, but they insisted that the family planning program was administered on a voluntary basis using persuasion and economic measures only. International reaction to the allegations were mixed. The [[UN Fund for Population Activities]] and the [[International Planned Parenthood Federation]] were generally supportive of China's family planning program. The [[United States Agency for International Development]], however, withdrew US$10&nbsp;million from the Fund in March 1985 based on allegations that coercion had been used.\n\nObservers suggested that an accurate assessment of the one-child program would not be possible until all women who came of childbearing age in the early 1980s passed their fertile years. As of 1987 the one-child program had achieved mixed results. In general, it was very successful in almost all urban areas but less successful in rural areas.\n\nRapid fertility reduction associated with the one-child policy has potentially negative results. For instance, in the future the elderly might not be able to rely on their children to care for them as they have in the past, leaving the state to assume the expense, which could be considerable. Based on United Nations and Chinese government statistics, it was estimated in 1987 that by the year 2000 the population 60 years and older (the retirement age is 60 in urban areas) would number 127 million, or 10.1% of the total population; the projection for 2025 was 234&nbsp;million elderly, or 16.4%. According to projections based on the 1982 census, if the one-child policy were maintained to the year 2000, 25% of China's population would be age 65 or older by the year 2040. In 2050, the number of people over 60 is expected to increase to 430 million.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Du|first=Peng|last2=Yang|first2=Hui|date=2010|title=China's population ageing and active ageing|url=|journal=China Journal of Social Work|volume=3|issue=2\u20133|pages=139\u2013152|doi=10.1080/17525098.2010.492636}}</ref>\n\n===Population density and distribution===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2019}}\nChina is the most populated country in the world and its national population density (137/km<sup>2</sup>) is very similar to [[List of countries by population density|those]] of countries like [[Denmark]] (excluding Greenland) or the [[Czech Republic]]. However, the overall population density of China conceals major regional variations. In 2002, about 94% of the population lived east of the [[Heihe\u2013Tengchong Line]], which makes up only 43% of the total land area, which leads to much higher average density (about 280/km\u00b2, little less than [[demographics of Japan|Japan]]).\n\nBroadly speaking, the population was concentrated east of the mountains{{which|date=September 2019}} and south of the northern steppe. The most densely populated areas included the [[Yangtze River Valley]] (of which the delta region was the most populous), [[Sichuan Basin]], [[North China Plain]], [[Pearl River Delta]], and the industrial area around the city of [[Shenyang]] in the northeast.\n\nPopulation is most sparse in the mountainous, desert, and grassland regions of the northwest and southwest. In [[Inner Mongolia]] Autonomous Region, portions are completely uninhabited, and only a few sections have populations denser than ten people per km<sup>2</sup>. The [[Inner Mongolia]], Xinjiang, and [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]] autonomous regions and [[Qinghai]] and [[Gansu]] comprise 55% of the country's land area but in 1985 contained only 5.7% of its population.\n[[File:Population_density_of_China_by_first-level_administrative_regions(English).png|thumb|left|600 px]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:top; float:right;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\"|  || Area (km<sup>2</sup>) || Population  || Density\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\"| China || 9,650,000 (100%) || 1,300,000,000 (100%) || 134.7/km<sup>2</sup>\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\"| '''5 provinces'''|| 5,246,400 (54.45%) || 79,533,000 (6.12%) ||rowspan=\"6\"| 15.16/km<sup>2</sup>\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\"| || [[Inner Mongolia]] || 1,183,000 (12.28% ) || 24,051,000\n|-\n| [[Xinjiang]] || 1,660,000 (17.23%) || 20,952,000\n|-\n| [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]] || 1,228,400 (12.75%) || 2,842,000\n|-\n| [[Qinghai]] || 721,000 (7.48%) || 5,516,000\n|-\n| [[Gansu]] || 454,000 (4.71%) || 26,172,000\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\"| '''China proper''' || 4,403,605 (45.55%) || 1,221,000,000 (93.89%) || 277.27/km<sup>2</sup>\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\"| <small>Source: National Bureau of Statistics</small>\n|}\n{{clr}}\n\n==Vital statistics==\n\n===Table of births and deaths 1950\u20132019===\nChina's fertility statistics differ depending on the source.

Beginning in the early 1950s, [[Mortality rate|mortality]] steadily declined; it continued to decline through 1978 and remained relatively constant through 1987. One major fluctuation was reported in a computer reconstruction of China's population trends from 1953 to 1987 produced by the [[United States Bureau of the Census]]. The computer model showed that the crude death rate increased dramatically during the famine years associated with the [[Great Leap Forward]] (1958\u201360).\n\nAccording to Chinese government statistics, the crude birth rate followed five distinct patterns from 1949 to 1982. It remained stable from 1949 to 1954, varied widely from 1955 to 1965, experienced fluctuations between 1966 and 1969, dropped sharply in the late 1970s, and increased from 1980 to 1981. Between 1970 and 1980, the crude birth rate dropped from 33.4 per 1,000 to 18.2 per 1,000. The government attributed this dramatic decline in fertility to the ''w\u01cen x\u012b sh\u01ceo'' (\"\u665a\u3001\u7a00\u3001\u5c11\", or \"late, long, few\": later marriages, longer intervals between births, and fewer children) [[birth control]] campaign. However, elements of socioeconomic change, such as increased employment of women in both urban and rural areas and reduced [[infant mortality]] (a greater percentage of surviving children would tend to reduce demand for additional children), may have played some role. The birth rate increased in the 1980s to a level over 20 per 1,000, primarily as a result of a marked rise in marriages and first births. The rise was an indication of problems with the one-child policy of 1979. Chinese sources, however, indicate that the birth rate started to decrease again in the 1990s and reached a level of around 12 per 1,000 in recent years.\n\nIn urban areas, the housing shortage may have been at least partly responsible for the decreased birth rate. Also, the policy in force during most of the 1960s and the early 1970s of sending large numbers of high school graduates to the countryside deprived cities of a significant proportion of persons of childbearing age and undoubtedly had some effect on birth rates (see [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966\u201376)). Primarily for economic reasons, rural birth rates tended to decline less than urban rates. The right to grow and sell agricultural products for personal profit and the lack of an old-age [[Economic welfare|Welfare system]] were incentives for rural people to produce many children, especially sons, for help in the fields and for support in old age. Because of these conditions, it is unclear to what degree education had been able to erode traditional values favoring large families.\n\nToday, the population continues to grow. There is also a serious [[gender imbalance]]. Census data obtained in 2000 revealed that 119 boys were born for every 100 girls, and among China's \"floating population\" the ratio was as high as 128:100. These situations led the government in July 2004 to ban selective abortions of female fetuses. It is estimated that this imbalance will rise until 2025\u20132030 to reach 20% then slowly decrease.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sinoptic.ch/textes/articles/2007/2007_Projection.population.Chine.pdf |title=Pascal Rocha da Silva, Projection de la population chinoise 2000\u20132050, p. 9, cf. |accessdate=14 October 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130811020453/http://www.sinoptic.ch/textes/articles/2007/2007_Projection.population.Chine.pdf |archivedate=11 August 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nChina now has an increasingly [[aging]] population; it is projected that 11.8% of the population in 2020 will be 65 years of age and older. Health care has improved dramatically in China since 1949. Major diseases such as [[cholera]], [[typhoid]], and [[scarlet fever]] have been brought under control. [[Life expectancy]] has more than doubled, and [[infant mortality]] has dropped significantly. On the negative side, the incidence of cancer, [[cerebrovascular disease]], and [[heart disease]] has increased to the extent that these have become the leading causes of death. Economic reforms initiated in the late 1970s fundamentally altered methods of providing health care; the collective medical care system has been gradually replaced by a more individual-oriented approach.\n\nIn [[2018 in China|2018]], China had the lowest birth rate since [[1961 in China|1961]], with an estimated of 15.23 million babies being born. The birth figure was 11.6 percent lower compared with 17,23 million in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/the-number-of-births-in-china-hit-its-lowest-level-since-1961/ar-BBSwv6C|archive-url=https://archive.today/20190215195511/https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/the-number-of-births-in-china-hit-its-lowest-level-since-1961/ar-BBSwv6C|url-status=dead|archive-date=2019-02-15|title=The number of births in China hit its lowest level since 1961|date=2019-02-15|website=archive.fo|access-date=2019-02-15}}</ref> Officials had expected 21-23 million births in 2018, much more than the 15.23 that occurred.

The [[Xiangyang District, Jiamusi|Xiangyang district]] of [[Jiamusi]] city ([[Heilongjiang]]) has a TFR of 0.41, which is the lowest TFR recorded anywhere in the world in recorded history. Other extremely low TFR counties are: 0.43 in the [[Heping District, Tianjin|Heping district]] of [[Tianjin city]] ([[Tianjin]]), and 0.46 in the [[Mawei district]] of [[Fuzhou]] city ([[Fujian]]).

population census since 1964. It was by far the most thorough and accurate census taken since 1949 and confirmed that China was a nation of more than 1 billion people, or about one-fifth of the world's population. The census provided demographers with a set of data on China's age-sex structure, fertility and mortality rates, and population density and distribution. Information was also gathered on minority ethnic groups, urban population, and marital status. For the first time since the People's Republic of China was founded, demographers had reliable information on the size and composition of the Chinese work force. The nation began preparing for the 1982 census in late 1976. Chinese census workers were sent to the United States and Japan to study modern census-taking techniques and automation. Computers were installed in every provincial-level unit except Tibet and were connected to a central processing system in the Beijing headquarters of the [[National Bureau of Statistics of the People's Republic of China|State Statistical Bureau]]. Pretests and small scale trial runs were conducted and checked for accuracy between 1980 and 1981 in twenty-four provincial-level units. Census stations were opened in rural [[production brigade]]s and urban neighborhoods. Beginning on 1 July 1982, each household sent a representative to a census station to be enumerated. The census required about a month to complete and employed approximately 5 million census takers.\n\nThe 1982 census collected data in nineteen demographic categories relating to individuals and households. The thirteen areas concerning individuals were name, relationship to head of household, sex, age, nationality, registration status, educational level, profession, occupation, status of nonworking persons, marital status, number of children born and still living, and number of births in 1981. The six items pertaining to households were type (domestic or collective), serial number, number of persons, number of births in 1981, number of deaths in 1981, and number of registered persons absent for more than one year. Information was gathered in a number of important areas for which previous data were either extremely inaccurate or simply nonexistent, including fertility, marital status, urban population, minority ethnic groups, sex composition, age distribution, and employment and unemployment.\n\nA fundamental anomaly in the 1982 statistics was noted by some Western analysts. They pointed out that although the birth and death rates recorded by the census and those recorded through the household registration system were different, the two systems arrived at similar population totals. The discrepancies in the vital rates were the result of the underreporting of both births and deaths to the authorities under the registration system; families would not report some births because of the one-child policy and would not report some deaths so as to hold on to the rations of the deceased.\n\nNevertheless, the 1982 census was a watershed for both Chinese and world demographics. After an eighteen-year gap, population specialists were given a wealth of reliable, up-to-date figures on which to reconstruct past demographic patterns, measure current population conditions, and predict future population trends. For example, Chinese and foreign demographers used the 1982 census age-sex structure as the base population for forecasting and making assumptions about future fertility trends. The data on age-specific [[fertility]] and [[mortality rate]]s provided the necessary base-line information for making population projections. The census data also were useful for estimating future [[Human resources|manpower]] potential, [[consumer needs]], and [[utility]], energy, and health-service requirements. The sudden abundance of demographic data helped population specialists immeasurably in their efforts to estimate world population. Previously, there had been no accurate information on these 21% of the Earth's inhabitants. Demographers who had been conducting research on global population without accurate data on the Chinese fifth of the world's population were particularly thankful for the 1982 breakthrough census.\n\n===Population control===\n{{See also|One-child policy|Two-child policy}}\n[[File:Birth rate in China.svg|450px|thumbnail|right|Birth rate in China]]\nInitially, China's post-1949 leaders were ideologically disposed to view a large population as an asset. But the liabilities of a large, rapidly growing population soon became apparent. For one year, starting in August 1956, vigorous support was given to the Ministry of Public Health's mass [[birth control]] efforts. These efforts, however, had little impact on fertility. After the interval of the [[Great Leap Forward]], Chinese leaders again saw rapid population growth as an obstacle to development, and their interest in birth control revived. In the early 1960s, schemes somewhat more muted than during the first campaign, emphasized the virtues of late marriage. Birth control offices were set up in the central government and some provincial-level governments in 1964. The second campaign was particularly successful in the cities, where the birth rate was cut in half during the 1963\u201366 period. The upheaval of the [[Cultural Revolution]] brought the program to a halt, however.\n\nIn 1972 and 1973 the party mobilized its resources for a nationwide birth control campaign administered by a group in the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]]. Committees to oversee birth control activities were established at all administrative levels and in various collective enterprises. This extensive and seemingly effective network covered both the rural and the urban population. In urban areas public security headquarters included population control sections. In rural areas the country's \"[[barefoot doctor]]s\" distributed information and contraceptives to [[people's commune]] members. By 1973 [[Mao Zedong]] was personally identified with the family planning movement, signifying a greater leadership commitment to controlled population growth than ever before. Yet until several years after Mao's death in 1976, the leadership was reluctant to put forth directly the rationale that population control was necessary for economic growth and improved [[living standards]].\n\nPopulation growth targets were set for both administrative units and individual families. In the mid-1970s the maximum recommended family size was two children in cities and three or four in the country. Since 1979 the government has advocated a one-child limit for both rural and urban areas and has generally set a maximum of two children in special circumstances. As of 1986 the policy for minority nationalities was two children per couple, three in special circumstances, and no limit for ethnic groups with very small populations. The overall goal of the one-child policy was to keep the total population within 1.2&nbsp;billion through the year 2000, on the premise that the [[Four Modernizations]] program would be of little value if population growth was not brought under control.\n\nThe one-child policy was a highly ambitious population control program. Like previous programs of the 1960s and 1970s, the one-child policy employed a combination of public education, social pressure, and in some cases coercion. The one-child policy was unique, however, in that it linked reproduction with economic cost or benefit.\n\nUnder the one-child program, a sophisticated system rewarded those who observed the policy and penalized those who did not. Through this policy, the increasing population got temperate after the penalties were made. Couples with only one child were given a \"one-child certificate\" entitling them to such benefits as cash bonuses, longer [[maternity leave]], better [[child care]], and preferential housing assignments. In return, they were required to pledge that they would not have more children. In the countryside, there was great pressure to adhere to the one-child limit. Because the rural population accounted for approximately 60% of the total, the effectiveness of the one-child policy in rural areas was considered the key to the success or failure of the program as a whole.\n\nIn rural areas the day-to-day work of family planning was done by [[Professional revolutionaries|cadres]] at the team and brigade levels who were responsible for women's affairs and by health workers. The women's team leader made regular household visits to keep track of the status of each family under her jurisdiction and collected information on which women were using [[contraceptives]], the methods used, and which had become pregnant. She then reported to the brigade women's leader, who documented the information and took it to a monthly meeting of the commune birth-planning committee. According to reports, ceilings or quotas had to be adhered to; to satisfy these cutoffs, unmarried young people were persuaded to postpone marriage, couples without children were advised to \"wait their turn,\" women with unauthorized pregnancies were pressured to have abortions, and those who already had children were urged to use [[contraception]] or undergo [[Compulsory sterilization|sterilization]]. Couples with more than one child were exhorted to be sterilized.\n\nThe one-child policy enjoyed much greater success in urban than in rural areas. Even without state intervention, there were compelling reasons for urban couples to limit the family to a single child. Raising a child required a significant portion of family income, and in the cities a child did not become an economic asset until he or she entered the work force at age sixteen. Couples with only one child were given preferential treatment in housing allocation. In addition, because city dwellers who were employed in state enterprises received pensions after retirement, the sex of their first child was less important to them than it was to those in rural areas.\n\nNumerous reports surfaced of coercive measures used to achieve the desired results of the one-child policy. The alleged methods ranged from intense psychological pressure to the use of physical force, including some grisly accounts of forced abortions and infanticide. Chinese officials admitted that isolated, uncondoned abuses of the program occurred and that they condemned such acts, but they insisted that the family planning program was administered on a voluntary basis using persuasion and economic measures only. International reaction to the allegations were mixed. The [[UN Fund for Population Activities]] and the [[International Planned Parenthood Federation]] were generally supportive of China's family planning program. The [[United States Agency for International Development]], however, withdrew US$10&nbsp;million from the Fund in March 1985 based on allegations that coercion had been used.\n\nObservers suggested that an accurate assessment of the one-child program would not be possible until all women who came of childbearing age in the early 1980s passed their fertile years. As of 1987 the one-child program had achieved mixed results. In general, it was very successful in almost all urban areas but less successful in rural areas.\n\nRapid fertility reduction associated with the one-child policy has potentially negative results. For instance, in the future the elderly might not be able to rely on their children to care for them as they have in the past, leaving the state to assume the expense, which could be considerable. Based on United Nations and Chinese government statistics, it was estimated in 1987 that by the year 2000 the population 60 years and older (the retirement age is 60 in urban areas) would number 127 million, or 10.1% of the total population; the projection for 2025 was 234&nbsp;million elderly, or 16.4%. According to projections based on the 1982 census, if the one-child policy were maintained to the year 2000, 25% of China's population would be age 65 or older by the year 2040. In 2050, the number of people over 60 is expected to increase to 430 million.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Du|first=Peng|last2=Yang|first2=Hui|date=2010|title=China's population ageing and active ageing|url=|journal=China Journal of Social Work|volume=3|issue=2\u20133|pages=139\u2013152|doi=10.1080/17525098.2010.492636}}</ref>\n\n===Population density and distribution===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2019}}\nChina is the most populated country in the world and its national population density (137/km<sup>2</sup>) is very similar to [[List of countries by population density|those]] of countries like [[Danemark]] (excluding Greenland) or the [[Czech Republic]]. However, the overall population density of China conceals major regional variations. In 2002, about 94% of the population lived east of the [[Heihe\u2013Tengchong Line]], which makes up only 43% of the total land area, which leads to much higher average density (about 280/km\u00b2, little less than [[demographics of Japan|Japan]]).\n\nBroadly speaking, the population was concentrated east of the mountains{{which|date=September 2019}} and south of the northern steppe. The most densely populated areas included the [[Yangtze River Valley]] (of which the delta region was the most populous), [[Sichuan Basin]], [[North China Plain]], [[Pearl River Delta]], and the industrial area around the city of [[Shenyang]] in the northeast.\n\nPopulation is most sparse in the mountainous, desert, and grassland regions of the northwest and southwest. In [[Inner Mongolia]] Autonomous Region, portions are completely uninhabited, and only a few sections have populations denser than ten people per km<sup>2</sup>. The [[Inner Mongolia]], Xinjiang, and [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]] autonomous regions and [[Qinghai]] and [[Gansu]] comprise 55% of the country's land area but in 1985 contained only 5.7% of its population.\n[[File:Population_density_of_China_by_first-level_administrative_regions(English).png|thumb|left|600 px]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:top; float:right;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\"|  || Area (km<sup>2</sup>) || Population  || Density\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\"| China || 9,650,000 (100%) || 1,300,000,000 (100%) || 134.7/km<sup>2</sup>\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\"| '''5 provinces'''|| 5,246,400 (54.45%) || 79,533,000 (6.12%) ||rowspan=\"6\"| 15.16/km<sup>2</sup>\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\"| || [[Inner Mongolia]] || 1,183,000 (12.28% ) || 24,051,000\n|-\n| [[Xinjiang]] || 1,660,000 (17.23%) || 20,952,000\n|-\n| [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]] || 1,228,400 (12.75%) || 2,842,000\n|-\n| [[Qinghai]] || 721,000 (7.48%) || 5,516,000\n|-\n| [[Gansu]] || 454,000 (4.71%) || 26,172,000\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\"| '''China proper''' || 4,403,605 (45.55%) || 1,221,000,000 (93.89%) || 277.27/km<sup>2</sup>\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\"| <small>Source: National Bureau of Statistics</small>\n|}\n{{clr}}\n\n==Vital statistics==\n\n===Table of births and deaths 1950\u20132019===\nChina's fertility statistics differ depending on the source.

Beginning in the early 1950s, [[Mortality rate|mortality]] steadily declined; it continued to decline through 1978 and remained relatively constant through 1987. One major fluctuation was reported in a computer reconstruction of China's population trends from 1953 to 1987 produced by the [[United States Bureau of the Census]]. The computer model showed that the crude death rate increased dramatically during the famine years associated with the [[Great Leap Forward]] (1958\u201360).\n\nAccording to Chinese government statistics, the crude birth rate followed five distinct patterns from 1949 to 1982. It remained stable from 1949 to 1954, varied widely from 1955 to 1965, experienced fluctuations between 1966 and 1969, dropped sharply in the late 1970s, and increased from 1980 to 1981. Between 1970 and 1980, the crude birth rate dropped from 33.4 per 1,000 to 18.2 per 1,000. The government attributed this dramatic decline in fertility to the ''w\u01cen x\u012b sh\u01ceo'' (\"\u665a\u3001\u7a00\u3001\u5c11\", or \"late, long, few\": later marriages, longer intervals between births, and fewer children) [[birth control]] campaign. However, elements of socioeconomic change, such as increased employment of women in both urban and rural areas and reduced [[infant mortality]] (a greater percentage of surviving children would tend to reduce demand for additional children), may have played some role. The birth rate increased in the 1980s to a level over 20 per 1,000, primarily as a result of a marked rise in marriages and first births. The rise was an indication of problems with the one-child policy of 1979. Chinese sources, however, indicate that the birth rate started to decrease again in the 1990s and reached a level of around 12 per 1,000 in recent years.\n\nIn urban areas, the housing shortage may have been at least partly responsible for the decreased birth rate. Also, the policy in force during most of the 1960s and the early 1970s of sending large numbers of high school graduates to the countryside deprived cities of a significant proportion of persons of childbearing age and undoubtedly had some effect on birth rates (see [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966\u201376)). Primarily for economic reasons, rural birth rates tended to decline less than urban rates. The right to grow and sell agricultural products for personal profit and the lack of an old-age [[Economic welfare|Welfare system]] were incentives for rural people to produce many children, especially sons, for help in the fields and for support in old age. Because of these conditions, it is unclear to what degree education had been able to erode traditional values favoring large families.\n\nToday, the population continues to grow. There is also a serious [[gender imbalance]]. Census data obtained in 2000 revealed that 119 boys were born for every 100 girls, and among China's \"floating population\" the ratio was as high as 128:100. These situations led the government in July 2004 to ban selective abortions of female fetuses. It is estimated that this imbalance will rise until 2025\u20132030 to reach 20% then slowly decrease.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sinoptic.ch/textes/articles/2007/2007_Projection.population.Chine.pdf |title=Pascal Rocha da Silva, Projection de la population chinoise 2000\u20132050, p. 9, cf. |accessdate=14 October 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130811020453/http://www.sinoptic.ch/textes/articles/2007/2007_Projection.population.Chine.pdf |archivedate=11 August 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nChina now has an increasingly [[aging]] population; it is projected that 11.8% of the population in 2020 will be 65 years of age and older. Health care has improved dramatically in China since 1949. Major diseases such as [[cholera]], [[typhoid]], and [[scarlet fever]] have been brought under control. [[Life expectancy]] has more than doubled, and [[infant mortality]] has dropped significantly. On the negative side, the incidence of cancer, [[cerebrovascular disease]], and [[heart disease]] has increased to the extent that these have become the leading causes of death. Economic reforms initiated in the late 1970s fundamentally altered methods of providing health care; the collective medical care system has been gradually replaced by a more individual-oriented approach.\n\nIn [[2018 in China|2018]], China had the lowest birth rate since [[1961 in China|1961]], with an estimated of 15.23 million babies being born. The birth figure was 11.6 percent lower compared with 17,23 million in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/the-number-of-births-in-china-hit-its-lowest-level-since-1961/ar-BBSwv6C|archive-url=https://archive.today/20190215195511/https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/the-number-of-births-in-china-hit-its-lowest-level-since-1961/ar-BBSwv6C|url-status=dead|archive-date=2019-02-15|title=The number of births in China hit its lowest level since 1961|date=2019-02-15|website=archive.fo|access-date=2019-02-15}}</ref> Officials had expected 21-23 million births in 2018, much more than the 15.23 that occurred.

Hong Kong's population increases because of immigration from the mainland and a large [[expatriate]] population comprising about 4%. Like Hong Kong, [[Macau]] also has a low birth rate relying on immigration to maintain its population.\n\n===Total fertility rate===\nAccording to the 2000 census, the [[Total fertility rate|TFR]] was 1.22 (0.86 for cities, 1.08 for towns and 1.43 for villages/outposts).

The [[Xiangyang District, Jiamusi|Xiangyang district]] of [[Jiamusi]] city ([[Heilongjiang]]) has a TFR of 0.41, which is the lowest TFR recorded anywhere in the world in recorded history. Other extremely low TFR counties are: 0.43 in the [[Heping District, Tianjin|Heping district]] of [[Tianjin city]] ([[Tianjin]]), and 0.46 in the [[Mawei district]] of [[Fuzhou]] city ([[Fujian]]).
