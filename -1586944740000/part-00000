More often than not, the murder relates to inheritance problems, feud-settling, or to get rid of the wife, for instance in order to remarry. Human rights agencies in Pakistan have repeatedly emphasized that victims were often women wanting to marry of their own will. In such cases, the victims held properties that the male members of their families did not wish to lose if the woman chose to marry outside the family.<ref name=\"Pakistan rejects pro-women bill\">{{cite news | title=Pakistan rejects pro-women bill  | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4311055.stm | work=BBC News | date=2005-03-02 | accessdate=2010-01-01}}</ref>\n\nA 1999 Amnesty International report drew specific attention to \"the failure of the authorities to prevent these killings by investigating and punishing the perpetrators.\"<ref name=\"Amnesty International\">{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ASA33/018/1999|title=Pakistan: Honour killings of women and girls|publisher=Amnesty International|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123134208/http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ASA33/018/1999|archivedate=2015-01-23}}</ref> According to [[women's rights]] advocates, the concepts of women as property and honour are so deeply entrenched in the social, political and economic fabric of Pakistan that the government, for the most part, ignores the daily occurrences of women being killed and maimed by their families.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hassan|first=Yasmeen|title=The Fate of Pakistani Women|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/25/opinion/25iht-edhass.2.t.html?pagewanted=1|accessdate=April 25, 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=March 25, 1999}}</ref> The fact that much of Pakistan's [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas|Tribal Areas]] are semi-autonomous and governed by often fundamentalist leaders makes federal enforcement difficult when attempted.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gardi|first=Balazs|title=The Truth About Talibanistan|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1601850,00.html|accessdate=April 25, 2012|newspaper=Time Magazine|date=March 22, 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Terminology related to honour killing ===\nBoth Appiah and Jafri explain the historical significance of ''karo-kari'' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|\u06a9\u0627\u0631\u0648\u06a9\u0627\u0631\u06cc}}}}) within Pakistan.

Once a woman is labeled as a kari, family members consider themselves to be authorized to kill her and the co-accused karo in order to restore family honour. In the majority of cases, the victim of the attacks is female with her attackers being male members of her family or community.<ref name=\"Khan_A_1999\" />\n\n=== Cultural pressures for honour killing in Pakistan  ===\nPakistan is a collective, patriarchal society, and therefore social boundaries and community regard are based on honour; in this situation, honour is based on the behaviour of kin or members of a certain group.<ref name=\":0\" /> A Pakistani folk saying describes well the cultural importance of honour: \"'<nowiki/>''Daulat khonay pur kuch naheen khota, sihat khonay pur kuch kho jaata hai, ghairat khonay pur sub kuch kho jaata hai''' (When wealth is lost nothing is lost; when health is lost something is lost; when honour is lost everything is lost).\"<ref name=\":0\" /> In Pakistan, honour is focused more on the perception of the community versus actual evidence.<ref name=\":0\" /> Honour is important for both women and men to uphold; women protect honour by modesty and men by masculinity.<ref name=\":0\" /> The cultural perspective behind honour is that if a woman does something that the community perceives as immodest then the men in her family must uphold their masculinity and regain the family honour by killing the woman.<ref name=\":0\" /> If this action isn't completed the shame and dishonour can extend beyond the immediate family to the entire lineage, or even to the entire community.<ref name=\":0\" /> There are multiple other cultural characteristics that contribute to honour including a strong disdain for death.<ref name=\":0\" /> Due to this, the perpetrator of an honour killing is highly regarded in the community because of their courage and because what they had to endure through with killing another was worse than death itself.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Prevalence==\nAs in other countries, the exact number of honour killings is not known. The [[Human Rights Commission of Pakistan]] lists 460 cases of reported honour killings in 2017, with 194 males and 376 females as victims.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://hrcpmonitor.org/search/?id=5|title=HRCP Archive {{!}} Search News|website=hrcpmonitor.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-02}}</ref> Of these killings, 253 were sparked by disapproval of illicit relations and 73 by disapproval of marriage choice.<ref name=\":3\" /> Additionally, out of the known suspect relationship with victims, over 93% were family relationships.<ref name=\":3\" /> Although these are most likely only a sample of the actual honour killings that were completed during 2017, it still gives a glimpse into characteristics of honour killings in Pakistan. Sources disagree as to the exact number by year, but according to [[Human Rights Watch]], NGOs/INGOs in the area estimate that around 1000 honour killings are carried out each year in Pakistan.<ref>\"World Report 2017: Rights Trends in Pakistan\".

Another reason is that honour killings are occurring in cultural and social contexts which do not recognize the ''criminality'' of honour killings.<ref name=\"Goldstein 2002 31\"/> The very nature of honour killings reflects deeply entrenched notions of \"honour\" and \"morality\", in which the perpetrator is upholding justice and order when the victim commits deplorable social acts. Honour killings thus inverts the roles of \"right\" and \"wrong\". The perpetrator becomes the champion of justice while the victim becomes the perpetrator and accused of the criminal act. Furthermore, human rights advocates are in wide agreement that the reported cases do not reflect the full extent of the issue, as honour killings have a high level of support in Pakistan's rural society, and thus often go unreported.<ref>[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2004/07/24/2003180222 Pakistan's honor killings enjoy high-level support].

The [[Human Rights Commission of Pakistan]] lists 460 cases of reported honour killings in 2017, with 194 males and 376 females as victims.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://hrcpmonitor.org/search/?id=5|title=HRCP Archive {{!}} Search News|website=hrcpmonitor.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-02}}</ref> Of these killings, 253 were sparked by disapproval of illicit relations and 73 by disapproval of marriage choice.<ref name=\":3\" /> Additionally, out of the known suspect relationship with victims, over 93% were family relationships.<ref name=\":3\" /> Although these are most likely only a sample of the actual honour killings that were completed during 2017, it still gives a glimpse into characteristics of honour killings in Pakistan.

One reason is the reluctance to report honour killings to official bodies. Another reason is that honour killings are occurring in cultural and social contexts which do not recognize the ''criminality'' of honour killings.<ref name=\"Goldstein 2002 31\"/> The very nature of honour killings reflects deeply entrenched notions of \"honour\" and \"morality\", in which the perpetrator is upholding justice and order when the victim commits deplorable social acts. Honour killings thus inverts the roles of \"right\" and \"wrong\". The perpetrator becomes the champion of justice while the victim becomes the perpetrator and accused of the criminal act. Furthermore, human rights advocates are in wide agreement that the reported cases do not reflect the full extent of the issue, as honour killings have a high level of support in Pakistan's rural society, and thus often go unreported.<ref>[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2004/07/24/2003180222 Pakistan's honor killings enjoy high-level support].

Meeting within the regular rotation of classes during the academic day, students develop skills in written and spoken language, reading comprehension, mathematics, English as a foreign language, and study habits. Students' IIP is tailored to their interests and aptitudes, so students may pursue independent study, explore enrichment activities, or receive subject support.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rectoryschool.org/academics|title=Academics - Rectory School|website=www.rectoryschool.org}}</ref>\n\nThe School embraces creativity.  All students are involved in music, either in classes or private lessons.  Moreover, the performing and visual arts courses are enhanced by excellent facilities.  Everyone also takes part in sports on levels that test the skilled athlete and encourage the beginner.\n\nThe Rectory School is accredited by the Connecticut Association of Independent Schools (CAIS), the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC), and approved by the [[Connecticut]] State Board of Education. Memberships include the [[National Association of Independent Schools]] (NAIS) The Connecticut Association of Independent Schools (CAIS) and [[The Association of Boarding Schools]] (TABS).  Rectory is a member of [[New England Preparatory School Athletic Council]] (NEPSAC).\n\nNearly 20 years ago, Mr. Brad Seaward, jumped at the opportunity to combine two passions of his: basketball and community outreach.

The rest attend online classes from all over the United States and the world. \n\nRectory is located on [[Connecticut Route 169]] next to the [[Pomfret School]].\n\n==Academics==\nThe Individualized Instruction Program (IIP) was pioneered by Rectory School and benefits the students by daily, one-to-one or small-group assistance and enrichment. Meeting within the regular rotation of classes during the academic day, students develop skills in written and spoken language, reading comprehension, mathematics, English as a foreign language, and study habits. Students' IIP is tailored to their interests and aptitudes, so students may pursue independent study, explore enrichment activities, or receive subject support.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rectoryschool.org/academics|title=Academics - Rectory School|website=www.rectoryschool.org}}</ref>\n\nThe School embraces creativity.  All students are involved in music, either in classes or private lessons.  Moreover, the performing and visual arts courses are enhanced by excellent facilities.  Everyone also takes part in sports on levels that test the skilled athlete and encourage the beginner.\n\nThe Rectory School is accredited by the Connecticut Association of Independent Schools (CAIS), the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC), and approved by the [[Connecticut]] State Board of Education. Memberships include the [[National Association of Independent Schools]] (NAIS) The Connecticut Association of Independent Schools (CAIS) and [[The Association of Boarding Schools]] (TABS).  Rectory is a member of [[New England Preparatory School Athletic Council]] (NEPSAC).\n\nNearly 20 years ago, Mr. Brad Seaward, jumped at the opportunity to combine two passions of his: basketball and community outreach. The result was the School's Hoops for Hunger program.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n*[[Robert Ludlum]] - Author, best known for the [[Jason Bourne]] novels\n*[[Owsley (musician)|William Reese \"Will\" Owsley III]] - Musician known as [[Owsley (musician)|Owsley]]\n*[[Peter L.
