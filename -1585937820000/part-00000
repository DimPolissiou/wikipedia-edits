The changes in brightness are quite close to the error margin and could also be due to an ''irregular shape''.<ref name=\"Ortiz2004\" />\n\n== Orbit ==\n[[File:TheKuiperBelt Orbits 2002TX300 2003EL61.svg|left|thumb|Orbits of {{mp|2002 TX|300}} (blue), {{dp|Haumea}} (green), and [[Neptune]] (grey)]]\n[[File:TheKuiperBelt Orbits 2002TX300 2003EL61 PolarView.svg|left|thumb|Orbits of {{mp|2002 TX|300}} (blue), {{dp|Haumea}} (green), and Neptune (grey)]]\n\nThe adjacent diagrams show polar and ecliptic views of the orbits of the two cubewanos.

The present positions (as of April 2006) are marked with the spheres, illustrating relative sizes and differences in [[albedo]] (both objects appear neutral in the visible spectrum).\n\n{{mp|2002 TX|300}} is classified as a classical Kuiper belt object and follows an orbit very similar to that of {{dp|Haumea}}: highly [[orbital inclination|inclined]] (26\u00b0) and moderately eccentric (e ~0.12), far from [[Neptune]]'s [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbations]] (perihelion at ~37&nbsp;AU).

The proportion of highly processed organic materials ([[tholin]]s), typically present on numerous [[trans-Neptunian object]]s, is very low. As suggested by Licandro et al. 2006, this lack of [[irradiated]] mantle suggest either a recent collision or [[comet]] activity.\n\n== Origin ==\n{{Main|Haumea family}}\n\nCommon physical characteristics with the dwarf planet Haumea together with similar orbit elements<ref name=\"Pinilla\" /> led to suggestion that {{mp|2002 TX|300}} was a member of the Haumean [[collisional family]].

The proportion of highly processed organic materials ([[tholin]]s), typically present on numerous [[trans-Neptunian object]]s, is very low.

It was filmed on location on the island of [[Santorini]], [[Greece]]. The original music score is composed by [[Basil Poledouris]]. ''Summer Lovers'' featured \"[[Hard to Say I'm Sorry]]\", a No. 1 hit for [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], and \"[[I'm So Excited]]\" by [[The Pointer Sisters]].\n\n==Plot==\nAmericans Michael Pappas and Cathy Featherstone, a young couple from [[Connecticut]] who have just graduated from college, have known each other about 10 years and have been together about half that time. They vacation for almost the entire summer on the Greek island of Santorini. Michael sees it as a chance to enjoy one last crazy summer before going to work at his recently deceased father's business in the fall. When they visit a nude beach crowded with other young tourists, they are hesitant at first but find themselves getting caught up in the uninhibited energy that surrounds them.\n\nCathy reads a book of sexual techniques, then ties Michael to the bed and drips candle wax on his chest. She comments that everyone thinks she's \"such a [[The History of Little Goody Two-Shoes|Goody Two-Shoes]]\" but she wants a little more adventure.\n\nMichael, who says he has never been with another woman, keeps noticing Lina Broussard, a French archaeologist on temporary assignment at the nearby [[Akrotiri (prehistoric city)|Akrotiri]] excavation. One day, at the beach without Cathy, he gets his chance to talk to Lina and ends up starting an affair with her. He then feels so guilty that Cathy immediately notices something is wrong, and he admits what he has done, insisting that he still loves Cathy.\n\nCathy is naturally disturbed by this, but tells him to get it out of his system, which he takes as permission to return to Lina. Cathy then goes to a local bar intending to sleep with another man as a way to get revenge against Michael for cheating on her. But in the end she chickens out after getting picked up by an amorous local boy. When Michael comes home later after seeing Lina again, Cathy is angry.\n\nCathy goes to Lina's home to confront her. Lina assures Cathy that she does not intend to take Michael away from her, which seems to calm Cathy somewhat. Lina and Cathy end up spending several hours together getting acquainted, and find themselves fascinated by each other's work\u2014Lina's archeology and Cathy's photography.\n\nMichael is confused when he learns that the two women are developing a friendship, but he quickly recovers and the three of them spend a few days gradually getting closer. Cathy knows Michael is still sleeping with Lina from time to time, but seems to accept it, although she says it would be difficult for her to see them in bed together. Nevertheless, she tolerates increasing signs of affection between Michael and Lina in her presence.\n\nIn a very tense scene one evening, Cathy encourages Michael to kiss Lina. He gives Lina a light peck, but Cathy says it isn't convincing. He gradually turns up the heat while watching Cathy intently for her reaction. He then kisses Cathy, checking to see how this makes Lina feel. The three end up spending the night together. Lina moves in with them, and they continue enjoying the island paradise as a [[threesome]].\n\nJust as the [[fantasy (psychology)|fantasy]] seems to be a total success, the natural complications of domestic life, like who does the laundry or dishes, come to the foreground. The three work through these problems, but then Cathy's mother, Jean, appears on a surprise visit, snapping everyone back to reality.  The visit is particularly tense because Cathy's mother arrives to awaken Michael and Lina after a birthday party for Lina at which the three cover each other in olive oil. Cathy tells Jean she's never been happier in her life. Although Lina claims to be bad at relationships and prefers just \"screwing\", the three actually seem to be falling in love all around.\n\nFinding herself in an intense relationship, and uncertain about her future with them, Lina begins to fear getting hurt when the summer ends and the Americans return home. They tell her it doesn't have to end, but don't go into any details. To avoid getting too close to her new friends, Lina disappears with another young man, Jan Tolin, she met at the beach.\n\nCathy and Michael are distraught, and spend several days searching for Lina. Eventually they conclude they won't find her as long as she wants to remain hidden. But their memories of Lina loom over everything they try to do, and they can no longer enjoy their time on the island. They pack up to return home, even though they have three weeks remaining prepaid on their rental.\n\nLina finds her fears are outweighed by her feelings for the Americans, and returns to reunite with them, only to discover they have already gone. She races to the airport and intercepts them just as they are about to board the aircraft. Overjoyed at seeing her again, Cathy and Michael return to spend the last three weeks of their summer with her.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Peter Gallagher]] as Michael Pappas\n* [[Daryl Hannah]] as Cathy Featherstone\n* [[Val\u00e9rie Quennessen]] as Lina Broussard (listed as Valerie Quennessen)\n* [[Barbara Rush]] as Jean Featherstone\n* [[Carole Cook]] as Barbara Foster\n* [[Hans van Tongeren]] as Jan Tolin\n* Lydia Lenosi as Aspa \n* Vladimiros Kiriakidis as Yorghos\n* Carlos Rodriguez Ramos as Cosmo \n* Henri Behar as Phillippe\n* [[Rika Dialina]] as Monica\n* Andreas Filipidis as Andreas\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n''Summer Lovers'' with the screenplay by director Randal Kleiser was filmed during August\u2013October 1981 primarily on the Greek island of [[Santorini]].

The player controls a laser cannon that can scroll left or right along a flat plane in order to target falling objects, such as large or small meteors, large or small spinning bombs, and guided missiles, as well as a UFO that crosses the screen from time to time at higher levels.<ref name=\"WeissCHVG\" />  Low hills and stars are seen in the background.  Unlike in ''Space Invaders'', the player does not face direct enemy fire, cannot hide beneath bunkers, and the game does not end when targets hit the ground.<ref name=\"Astrosmash\"/>\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:AstrosmashGP.jpg|thumb|left|A laser cannon defends the Earth from a [[meteor shower]].]]\nThere are four types of targets, each of which may move at a range of speeds.  As the game advances, the range of speeds for each type of target increases.<ref name=\"Astrosmash Manual\">''Astrosmash'' Cartridge Instructions, [[Mattel]] Inc. (1981).</ref>\n\n*The bulk of the targets are meteors, which come in two sizes and various colors.  Both sizes fall vertically when entering the screen.  Large meteors may be destroyed with a direct hit, or may split into two smaller meteors, which fall diagonally in opposite directions.  Small meteors are destroyed with a single hit.\n*The player must also shoot spinning bombs, or spinners, which are white, come in two sizes, and spin while falling vertically.  Each spinner emits a loud whistling sound, which gradually lowers in pitch as it approaches the ground.\n*Guided missiles appear occasionally as white dots making a pulsing sound, and may fall diagonally toward the player's initial location, or track the laser cannon as it moves left and right.  If a missile reaches the ground, it may disappear, or it may continue to track left or right, and can only be avoided by entering [[hyperspace]].  The missile may change directions several times before disappearing.\n*UFOs may cross the screen occasionally, beginning at level 4, firing non-guided salvos aimed at the player's laser cannon.\n\nThe player loses a laser cannon each time it is hit by a falling meteor, a guided missile, a non-guided salvo, or by shrapnel from a nearby explosion, and any time a spinner reaches the ground, even if it does not strike the gun.  Each target hit increases the player's score; it decreases by half as much each time a meteor reaches the ground, or a laser cannon is destroyed.  An extra gun is awarded each time the player's peak score increases by 1,000 points.<ref name=\"Astrosmash Manual\"/>\n\nThe game has six levels, each of which features increased speed and scoring.  Each level is represented by a differently-colored background.  Level 1, up to 999 points, is black; level 2, from 1,000 to 4,999 points, is blue; level 3, from 5,000 to 19,999 points, is purple; level 4, from 20,000 to 49,999 points, is turquoise; level 5, from 50,000 to 99,999 points, is gray; and level 6, above 100,000 points, is black again.  Speed continues to increase along with the player's peak score, at 200,000, 500,000, and 1,000,000 points.<ref name=\"Astrosmash Manual\"/>\n\nThe player has the option of firing single shots by pressing the fire buttons, or switching to automatic fire at a rate of three shots per second.  The hyperspace option moves the gun to a random location, which may or may not be safer than the starting point.  The game can also be paused at any time.<ref name=\"Astrosmash Manual\"/>\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Intellivision - gi 1326971.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The Intellivision Master Component, with ''Astrosmash'' loaded and an ''Astrosmash'' overlay on the left controller.]]\n''Astrosmash'' was originally conceived when a game called ''Meteor!'', an ''Asteroids'' clone, did not fill up the ROM space of an entire cartridge.

The verses of \"Prayer\" are constructed of two successive measures of 4/4, a measure of 10/4 (using 4/4 + 2/4 + 4/4), and two final measures of 4/4.

Similar to the history of Warwick's double-sided hit, the Aretha Franklin version was intended for the B-side of the July 1968 single release \"[[The House That Jack Built (song)|The House That Jack Built]]\" but began to accrue its own airplay that August. In October 1968 \"I Say a Little Prayer\" reached number ten on the Hot 100 and number three on the R&B singles chart.<ref>{{cite book |title= Top R&B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942-2004|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=215}}</ref>  The same month the single was certified Gold by the RIAA. \"Prayer\" became Franklin's ninth and last consecutive Hot 100 top 10 hit on the Atlantic label. Franklin's \"Prayer\" has a special significance in her UK career, as with its September 1968 No. 4 peak it became Franklin's biggest UK hit; subsequently Franklin has surpassed that track's UK peak only with her No. 1 collaboration with [[George Michael]], \"[[I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me)]]\".\n\nIn February 1987, UK music weekly ''[[New Musical Express]]'' published its critics' top 150 singles of all time, with Franklin's \"I Say a Little Prayer\" ranked at No. 1, followed by [[Al Green]]'s \"[[Tired of Being Alone]]\" and Warwick's \"[[Walk On By (song)|Walk On By]]\".{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} (Franklin's \"I Say a Little Prayer\" did not appear in the magazine's in-house critics' top 100 singles poll conducted in November 2002.)  In Australia, \"I Say a Little Prayer\" and \"The House That Jack Built\" were assigned a joint chart ranking which saw the double-A-side hit reach No. 10 in November 1968. \"I Say a Little Prayer\" also gave Franklin a European hit with chartings in France (#12), Germany (#29) and the Netherlands (#4).\n\n==Charts==\n{{col-begin|width=67%}}\n{{col-2}}\n===Weekly charts===\n;Dionne Warwick\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1967\u201368)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n|Australia ([[Kent Music Report]])\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|77\n|-\n|Canada Top Singles ''{{small|([[RPM (magazine)|RPM]])}}'' <ref>{{cite web|url= |title=Item Display - RPM - Library and Archives Canada |website=Collectionscanada.gc.ca |date=1967-12-17 }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\n|-\n|US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] <ref>''Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955-1990'' - {{ISBN|0-89820-089-X}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\n|-\n|US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Top R&B Songs]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|8\n|-\n|US [[Cash Box (magazine)|''Cash Box'']] Top 100\n|align=\"center\"|5\n|-\n|US [[Record World (magazine)|''Record World'']] Top 100\n|align=\"center\"|3\n|-\n|}\n\n===Year-end charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1967)\n!

The screenplay concerns a coven of devil-worshipping necrophiles that moves to Los Angeles and sets up their base of operations out of a [[funeral home]].\n\n== Plot ==\nYoung, attractive [[Los Angeles]] heiress Lindsay Finch has a habit of dressing in mourning and attending [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]]s for men she never knew. When everyone else leaves, she kneels before the coffins and kisses the corpses passionately. However, at the many parties she holds at her house, she shows no interest in any of the (living) men. She is also fixated with her deceased father, frequently daydreaming about her childhood with him and putting her hair in pigtails to visit his grave.\n\nHer friend Wade Farrow is romantically interested in her, but she rejects his affections. Meanwhile, mortician Fred McSweeney notices Lindsay's attendance at the wakes and, although she won't admit to her secret passion, he recognizes her as a kindred spirit. Fred has a [[Satanism|Satanic]] coven that meets after hours in the mortuary for [[necrophilia|necrophilic]] orgies with the latest cadavers. At one point, Fred picks up a [[gay]] male [[male prostitution|hustler]] under the guise of wanting to engage in sex. Fred brings him to the mortuary where he straps him down and [[embalming|embalm]]s him alive by pumping him full of [[formaldehyde]]. Fred eventually coaxes Lindsay to join his group. When Wade follows her to the funeral home, he stumbles across one of the group preparing a body for the coming orgy, and is killed before being sexually ravaged by the cult.\n\nAt one of the wakes, Lindsay meets and finds herself drawn to the deceased's brother, art gallery owner Alex Martin. An intense romance begins, Lindsay's first real relationship. The two get married, but Lindsay can't bring herself to consummate the marriage, and Alex is confused and frustrated by his new wife's inability to return his affections. Alex sees Lindsay entering Fred's mortuary one afternoon and grows suspicious of her day-to-day activities. During a conversation with Miss Pritchard, the maid at Lindsay's home, Alex learns that Lindsay developed an unhealthy obsession with her dead father at a young age, and that Lindsay would have her drive her to his grave every day.\n\nAlex drives to the cemetery, and finds Lindsay in a childlike state, frollicking around her father's grave. His appearance there startles her, and Lindsay flees in her car. The following day, Alex attempts to confront her again over the incident, and they briefly become copacetic. They plan to go into the country to visit Alex's family for dinner, but Lindsay claims to feel ill, and encourages Alex to go alone. Before leaving, Alex opens a registered letter addressed to Lindsay from Fred's funeral parlor, notifying of a meeting that night.\n\nAlex attends the family dinner without Lindsay, but leaves early and drives to Fred's funeral parlor. He enters the building and stumbles upon Lindsay and the rest of the cult about to engage in sex with a male corpse. Upon seeing Alex, Fred stabs him to death. Lindsay is brought home by Fred, who gives her a sedative before telling her that he has \"prepared\" Alex, and that he is in the bedroom waiting for her. While Lindsay lies there, she remembers her inadvertent shooting of her father during her childhood, which resulted in his death.

Chris barely survived being shot in the head by one of the thugs. Now a 22-year-old grossly disfigured young man, he escapes from the asylum on Halloween after killing two orderlies who mock his wearing of masks that resemble those the thugs were wearing.\n\nHis old home is now inhabited by David Bexter's (Derek Osedach) family; Bexter hosts a Halloween party there with his girlfriend Shannon (Rebekah Kochan), his friends, and his schoolmates. Vale kills a party-goer named Todd (Nicholas Daly Clark) at a gas station, steals his costume and his car, and drives to the party.\n\nAt the party Vale is taken for Todd by everyone and starts a killing spree unnoticed. Meanwhile, David fakes a dispute with a friend who kidnaps Vale (who still is taken for Todd) with a gun, and another friend disguised as a police officer, who is forced to hand over the keys of his car. After escaping with the car, the kidnapper is murdered by Vale, who goes back to the party in it. Because someone at the party has called the real police, the angry officer ends the party by telling everyone to go home, leaving only David, the now disappointed Shannon, and some friends.\n\nVale enters the house again, kills several of the remaining people and ties up Shannon who is wearing the collar of his mother that was found in the house earlier. He breaks up a hole in the wall that was covered with boards where the corpse of his mother was hidden by his father before committing suicide.\n\nAs one girl escapes from the house in panic David begins to search for Shannon, finding her captured in the basement. After freeing her Vale knocks out David from behind but Shannon manages to grab a gun that Vale has lost shooting him twice, presuming the killer for dead.\n\nAs the police and ambulance arrives later David seems to have disappeared with the police searching for him. Suddenly a hooded person appears behind a police officer who is talking to Shannon. Shannon grabs the officers gun shooting and killing the hooded person, after removing the hood she is shocked to see that she killed David.\n\nIn the final scene Vale is seen hitch-hiking and picked up by a car-driver who presumes him to having a long Halloween party night. The film ends while the car leaves.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* Derek Osedach as David Baxter\n* [[Rebekah Kochan]] as Shannon\n* Scot Nery as Christopher Vale\n* Sean Durrie as Larry\n* Alicia Klein as Tracy\n* [[Erica Roby]] as Angela\n* Amanda Ward as Kendall\n* [[Jared Cohn]] as Daryll (as Jared Michaels)\n* Jay Costelo as Eddie\n* Michael Schatz as The Troll\n* Amelia Jackson-Gray as Jeanine\n* Nicholas Daly Clark as Todd\n* Tank Murdoch as Officer Connors\n* Stephanie Christine Medina as Kim\n* Jonathan Weber as Charlie\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Reception==\nCinema Crazed panned the movie, writing \"as a \"''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]''\" wannabe, it's horrible, but as a slasher film on its own merits it's horrible\".<ref>{{Cite web|title = Halloween Night (2006)|url = http://cinema-crazed.com/blog/2006/11/26/halloween-night-2006/|website = Cinema Crazed|access-date = 2016-02-07|last = Vasquez Jr.|first = Felix}}</ref> HorrorNews.net criticized some aspects of the film but also wrote \"You get what you signed up for and therefore should be satisfied with that fact alone.
