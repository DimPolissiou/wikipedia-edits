The city has been plagued by a series of brutal, ritualistic child murders. The first victim is a young boy found murdered in an abandoned movie theater. A man named Tom Lopez frantically phones in the discovery of the body, and claims the crimes are being committed by members of an Hispanic cult practicing a malevolent version of [[brujer\u00eda]]. Cal is appointed to examine Tom, who raves about the cult's powerful leader.\n\nA second victim is found eviscerated on a makeshift altar beneath a dock in [[Staten Island]]. Cal begins to inquire about brujer\u00eda to Carmen, his housekeeper and nanny, who practices a benevolent form of it, leaving protection charms in the apartment for Cal and Chris. The following day, Tom, paranoid and being followed by mysterious men, stabs himself to death in a diner. Later, Cal and his new girlfriend, Jessica, attend a party where a mysterious Caribbean man, Palo, attempts to steal a necklace from Jessica; shortly before, Jessica had left her compact in the bathroom, which became subject to a [[curse]] by Palo. When Cal returns home, he finds Carmen performing a ritual on Chris, and angrily throws her out of the house, despite the fact that she assures him she is attempting to protect him.\n\nChris accompanies his affluent Aunt Kate and Uncle Dennis on a trip to stay at their country home. Meanwhile, Cal and Jessica consult Oscar Sezine, a friend of Tom's, who believes the cult is planning a ritualized murder for the [[summer solstice]] four days away. Oscar performs a [[ritual purification|purification ritual]] in an attempt to ensure safety of Chris, whom he worries may be targeted as a [[human sacrifice|sacrifice]] for the solstice. The next morning, Jessica finds a [[boil]] on her face and falls ill. Before departing to reunite with Kate, Dennis, and Chris in the country, Cal receives a frantic phone call from police lieutenant Sean McTaggert. Cal arrives at McTaggert's apartment, finding it in disarray, and McTaggert seated with a gun, rambling in a paranoid manner. He shows Cal a photo and secret file he uncovered documenting elite businessman Robert Calder's ritual murder of his own son.\n\nCal leaves with the file at McTaggert's insistence. After he leaves, McTaggert commits suicide. Meanwhile, Jessica has a [[panic attack]] after the boil on her face bursts, revealing baby spiders\u2014a spider has apparently laid eggs in her skin. While Cal tends to Jessica in the hospital, Kate leaves him a voice message that she has changed her plans and is going to return Chris to him, but the message is cut short. Unaware Kate has called, Cal departs the hospital with his friend Marty, who drives him to Kate and Dennis's country house. Upon arriving, Dennis tells Cal Kate has gone to a 24-hour grocery store. In the living room, Dennis recounts he and Kate's travels to the Caribbean when Kate was a [[graduate student]], and how they witnessed the power of a human sacrifice. Palo and Colburn then enter the room, along with a number of other cultists, urging Cal to join, and stating that Chris has been predestined to become a sacrifice.\n\nCal flees the house through an upstairs window after finding Chris no longer in his room. In the boathouse, Cal finds Kate's dead body before he is knocked unconscious by Palo. Cal is driven to an abandoned warehouse, where Chris's ritual murder is to be carried out among the cult. Cal thwarts the sacrifice by stabbing Dennis to death, and Marty, who followed them to the warehouse, comes to Cal's aid, shooting various cultists to death from an upper landing. Colburn abducts Chris and the two ascend to the top of the warehouse in a freight elevator. Marty is incapacitated with a blowpipe dart by Palo, but not before he severely burns Palo's face, blinding him. Cal manages to chase Colburn into a storage room, stabbing him to death before retrieving Chris. A blinded Palo attacks Cal, but falls off the scaffolding when Chris coaxes him toward him, and is impaled to death below.\n\nSome time later, Cal, Jessica, and Chris go to vacation at a farmhouse. In the barn loft, Cal finds a shrine adorned with various sacrificed animals. He is approached by Jessica from below, who admits responsibility, telling him they will \"be safe now.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Martin Sheen]] as Cal Jamison\n* [[Helen Shaver]] as Jessica Halliday\n* [[Harley Cross]] as Chris Jamison\n* [[Robert Loggia]] as Lieutenant Sean McTaggert\n* [[Jimmy Smits]] as Tom Lopez\n* Malick Bowens as Palo\n* [[Elizabeth Wilson]] as Kate Maslow\n* [[Harris Yulin]] as Robert Calder\n* [[Lee Richardson (actor)|Lee Richardson]] as Dennis Maslow\n* [[Richard Masur]] as Marty Wertheimer\n* Carla Pinza as Carmen Ruiz\n* [[Janet-Laine Green]] as Lisa Jamison\n* [[Ra\u00fal D\u00e1vila]] as Oscar Sezine\n* Geoffrey Kellett as Paramedic\n}}\n\n==Analysis==\nBarna William Donovan notes that there were several Satanic-themed Hollywood films in the 1970s. Citing as examples ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' (1973) and ''[[The Omen (film series)|The Omen]]'' film series (1976-1991). But he also noted that Hollywood seemed to have lost interest in the subject by the 1980s. He cites ''The Believers'' as one of only two noteworthy films about [[Theistic Satanism|Devil worship]] created in the 1980s, the other one being ''[[Angel Heart]]'' (1987). Though he notes that ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'' (1984) also touched on the similar subject of a demon-worshiping cult, which abducts children and offers [[human sacrifice]]s.<ref name=\"Donovan\">Donovan (2011), p. 129-130</ref>\n\nHe points out that ''Angel Heart'' was a [[period piece]] set in the 1940s, and so fantastic that it limited its connections to the contemporary world of the 1980s \"and its fundamentalist [[paranoia]]s\", while ''The Believers'' was set in that contemporary world. The villains were not, however, worshipers of the [[Judeo-Christian]] [[Satan]]. Instead they were practitioners of [[Santer\u00eda]], the legitimate [[Afro-Caribbean]] religion depicted in the film as \"a cult of evil that condones human sacrifice\".<ref name=\"Donovan\"/> Neither film approached the subject of the 1980s hysteria over [[Satanic ritual abuse]], a [[conspiracy theory]] which generated [[Sensationalism|sensationalist headlines]] in this decade. Donovan concludes that Hollywood distanced itself from the subject matter, probably because [[child sexual abuse]] was deemed an unfit subject for popcorn entertainment.<ref name=\"Donovan\"/>\n\nAccording to [[John Kenneth Muir]], the message of the film is that [[yuppie]]s would do anything for success, including calling upon dark gods.<ref name=\"Muir\">Muir (2007), p. 558-559</ref> Muir points similarities to ''[[The Possession of Joel Delaney]]'' (1972), as both films fear ethnicity. For example, in ''The Believers'', a cleaning woman working for the Jamisons tries to protect Chris by using a benevolent version of Santeria. Cal fails to distinguish between good and evil magic and treats her as a threat.<ref name=\"Muir\">Muir (2007), p. 558-559</ref> The film depicts [[Manhattan]] as a place where alien cultures merge and the Christian white man has reasons to fear the pagans, who may come for his children. As such, it plays on a fear for the ethnic, racial, and religious [[Other (philosophy)|Other]].<ref name=\"Muir\">Muir (2007), p. 558-559</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] complained that most films about Caribbean religions tend to involve \"guys with blank eyes\" and [[animal sacrifice]], bloodthirsty cults, sadistic killers, and a quest for innocent blood; they never depict any positive aspect to these religions. He found this to be a prejudiced treatment.<ref name=\"Ebert\">Ebert (2000), p. 36-38</ref>  He also complained that the film makes use of multiple ritualistic details (such as circles of ashes, blood, and charms), without ever bothering to explain their meaning.<ref name=\"Ebert\">Ebert (2000), p. 36-38</ref> According to Mercedes Cros Sandoval, the film brought both public attention and negative publicity for [[Santer\u00eda]].<ref name=\"Sandoval\">Sandoval (2008), p. 366</ref>\n\nThe film is more typical of its decade in the negative depiction of the [[upper class]] of New York City. The cultists turn out to be members of this social class which literally sacrifice their children in exchange for \"fame, wealth, and power\". Their success and [[Social mobility|upward mobility]] is based not on business acumen, but their practice of Santeria. Muir sees this as a literal interpretation of a familiar phrase, [[Reaganomics|voodoo economics]].<ref name=\"Muir\">Muir (2007), p. 558-559</ref> \nMuir notes a few similarities with ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' (1968). An evil cult is depicted as active in a modern city, hiding in plain sight. And a couple of [[limousine liberal]] friends of the Jamisons are revealed to be cultists in their own right.<ref name=\"Muir\">Muir (2007), p. 558-559</ref>\n\nFor Muir, the highlight of the film involves the depiction of a [[Louisiana Voodoo|voodoo]]-like [[curse]]. Jessica Halliday ([[Helen Shaver]]) accidentally leaves her [[Compact (cosmetics)|compact]] in a bathroom while snooping around in Calder's office. By the time she retrieves it, it has become a cursed item. While using it, something \"gets under her beautiful skin\". It manifests as a [[boil]], which gets progressively redder and more inflamed. Finally it swells to capacity, and spiders start emerging from the boil's interior.<ref name=\"Muir\">Muir (2007), p. 558-559</ref>\n\n==Release==\n{{expand section|date=March 2019}}\n===Controversy===\n''The Believers'' was shown to have influenced the [[Santer\u00eda]]-based cult established by [[Adolfo Constanzo]] and supported by [[Sara Aldrete]] in [[Matamoros, Mexico]].<ref name=\"RS\">Rolling Stone (1989), p. 35-36</ref> \n\n===Critical response===\n{{expand section|date=March 2019}}\nOn review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''The Believers'' holds an approval rating of 35%, based on 17 reviews, and an average rating of 4.85/10.<ref name=\"rottomatoes\">{{cite web |title=The Believers (1987) - Rotten Tomatoes |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_believers_1987 |website=Rotten Tomatoes.com |publisher=Flixter |accessdate=November 21, 2019}}</ref>  \n\n[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film one and a half stars out of 4, denouncing the film as \"an awesomely silly, tasteless, and half-witted movie.\"<ref name=\"ebert87\">{{cite web |last1=Ebert |first1=Roger |title=The Believers Movie Review & Film Summary (1987) |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-believers-1987 |website=Roger Ebert.com |publisher=Roger Ebert |accessdate=28 February 2019}}</ref> Dennis Schwartz' from ''Ozus' World Movie Reviews'' awarded the film a grade C+, calling the film \"muddled\", and criticized the film's cheap scares, writing, and lack of a believable storyline.<ref name=\"schwartz17\">{{cite web |last1=Schwartz |first1=Dennis |title=believers |url=http://homepages.sover.net/~ozus/believers.html |website=Sover.net |publisher=Dennis Schwartz |accessdate=1 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nHowever, not all reviews of the film were negative.\nHal Hinson from ''[[The Washington Post]]'' gave the film a mostly positive review, writing, \"''The Believers'' is a bizarre, occult thriller about the implications of religious faith.

Donovan concludes that Hollywood distanced itself from the subject matter, probably because [[child sexual abuse]] was deemed an unfit subject for popcorn entertainment.<ref name=\"Donovan\"/>\n\nAccording to [[John Kenneth Muir]], the message of the film is that [[yuppie]]s would do anything for success, including calling upon dark gods.<ref name=\"Muir\">Muir (2007), p. 558-559</ref> Muir points similarities to ''[[The Possession of Joel Delaney]]'' (1972), as both films fear ethnicity. For example, in ''The Believers'', a cleaning woman working for the Jamisons tries to protect Chris by using a benevolent version of Santeria. Cal fails to distinguish between good and evil magic and treats her as a threat.<ref name=\"Muir\">Muir (2007), p. 558-559</ref> The film depicts [[Manhattan]] as a place where alien cultures merge and the Christian white man has reasons to fear the pagans, who may come for his children. As such, it plays on a fear for the ethnic, racial, and religious [[Other (philosophy)|Other]].<ref name=\"Muir\">Muir (2007), p. 558-559</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] complained that most films about Caribbean religions tend to involve \"guys with blank eyes\" and [[animal sacrifice]], bloodthirsty cults, sadistic killers, and a quest for innocent blood; they never depict any positive aspect to these religions. He found this to be a prejudiced treatment.<ref name=\"Ebert\">Ebert (2000), p. 36-38</ref>  He also complained that the film makes use of multiple ritualistic details (such as circles of ashes, blood, and charms), without ever bothering to explain their meaning.<ref name=\"Ebert\">Ebert (2000), p. 36-38</ref> According to Mercedes Cros Sandoval, the film brought both public attention and negative publicity for [[Santer\u00eda]].<ref name=\"Sandoval\">Sandoval (2008), p. 366</ref>\n\nThe film is more typical of its decade in the negative depiction of the [[upper class]] of New York City. The cultists turn out to be members of this social class which literally sacrifice their children in exchange for \"fame, wealth, and power\". Their success and [[Social mobility|upward mobility]] is based not on business acumen, but their practice of Santeria. Muir sees this as a literal interpretation of a familiar phrase, [[Reaganomics|voodoo economics]].<ref name=\"Muir\">Muir (2007), p. 558-559</ref> \nMuir notes a few similarities with ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' (1968). An evil cult is depicted as active in a modern city, hiding in plain sight. And a couple of [[limousine liberal]] friends of the Jamisons are revealed to be cultists in their own right.<ref name=\"Muir\">Muir (2007), p. 558-559</ref>\n\nFor Muir, the highlight of the film involves the depiction of a [[Louisiana Voodoo|voodoo]]-like [[curse]]. Jessica Halliday ([[Helen Shaver]]) accidentally leaves her [[Compact (cosmetics)|compact]] in a bathroom while snooping around in Calder's office. By the time she retrieves it, it has become a cursed item. While using it, something \"gets under her beautiful skin\". It manifests as a [[boil]], which gets progressively redder and more inflamed. Finally it swells to capacity, and spiders start emerging from the boil's interior.<ref name=\"Muir\">Muir (2007), p. 558-559</ref>\n\n==Release==\n{{expand section|date=March 2019}}\n===Controversy===\n''The Believers'' was shown to have influenced the [[Santer\u00eda]]-based cult established by [[Adolfo Constanzo]] and supported by [[Sara Aldrete]] in [[Matamoros, Mexico]].<ref name=\"RS\">Rolling Stone (1989), p. 35-36</ref> \n\n===Critical response===\n{{expand section|date=March 2019}}\nOn review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''The Believers'' holds an approval rating of 35%, based on 17 reviews, and an average rating of 4.85/10.<ref name=\"rottomatoes\">{{cite web |title=The Believers (1987) - Rotten Tomatoes |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_believers_1987 |website=Rotten Tomatoes.com |publisher=Flixter |accessdate=November 21, 2019}}</ref>  \n\n[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film one and a half stars out of 4, denouncing the film as \"an awesomely silly, tasteless, and half-witted movie.\"<ref name=\"ebert87\">{{cite web |last1=Ebert |first1=Roger |title=The Believers Movie Review & Film Summary (1987) |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-believers-1987 |website=Roger Ebert.com |publisher=Roger Ebert |accessdate=28 February 2019}}</ref> Dennis Schwartz' from ''Ozus' World Movie Reviews'' awarded the film a grade C+, calling the film \"muddled\", and criticized the film's cheap scares, writing, and lack of a believable storyline.<ref name=\"schwartz17\">{{cite web |last1=Schwartz |first1=Dennis |title=believers |url=http://homepages.sover.net/~ozus/believers.html |website=Sover.net |publisher=Dennis Schwartz |accessdate=1 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nHowever, not all reviews of the film were negative.\nHal Hinson from ''[[The Washington Post]]'' gave the film a mostly positive review, writing, \"''The Believers'' is a bizarre, occult thriller about the implications of religious faith.

With assistance from the mysterious Yost, Walker sets out to find Reese and recover his half of the heist: $93,000. Reese used all of the money from the job to pay back a debt to a crime syndicate called \"The Organization.\"\n\nWalker goes to Los Angeles where he bursts in on Lynne and riddles her bed with bullets, only to find Reese has long since disappeared.

Director Boorman claims to not have an opinion on the matter. \"What it is<!--not a mistake--> is what you see,\" responded Boorman. Steven Soderbergh has described ''Point Blank'' as \"memory film\" for Marvin. Boorman believes the film is about Lee Marvin's brutalizing experiences in World War II, which dehumanized him and left him desperately searching for his humanity.<ref name=Commentary/>\n\nCritic [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]] has written that the character of Walker is actually dead throughout the entire movie and the events of the film are a dream of the accumulating stages of revenge.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Thomson|first1=David|title=The Big Screen: The Story of the Movies|date=2012|publisher=Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=978-0-374-19189-4|page=406|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MeAkGAnNfJYC&pg=PA406&dq=point+blank+lee+marvin+ghost&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Bm-YVI3xCIWgyQSv84KgAw&ved=0CDYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=point%20blank%20lee%20marvin%20ghost&f=false|accessdate=22 December 2014}}</ref> Others have also considered this concept: Brynn White has questioned whether or not Walker is a mortal or a ghost, \"a vaporous embodiment of bitter vengeance barely clinging to Boorman\u2019s variegated frames\", and Boorman himself has commented: \"He could just as easily be a ghost or a shadow\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ruffles|first1=Tom|title=Ghost Images: Cinema of the Afterlife|date=2004|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson, NC|isbn=0-7864-2005-7|page=237|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=za8FamEz9wIC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=22 December 2014}}</ref> Some critics consider ''Point Blank'', \"a haunted, dream-like film that draws upon the spatial and temporal experiments of modernist European art cinema\",<ref>{{cite web|last1=Danks|first1=Adrian|title=A Man Out of Time: John Boorman and Lee Marvin\u2019s Point Blank|url=http://sensesofcinema.com/2007/cteq/point-blank/#b1|website=Senses of Cinema|publisher=Film Victoria, Australia|accessdate=22 December 2014}}</ref> especially the \"time-fractured\" films of French director [[Alain Resnais]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Erickson|first1=Glenn|title=Point Blank|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/2265/Point-Blank/home-video-reviews.html|website=TCM Classic Movies|accessdate=22 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Style==\n''Point Blank'' combines elements of ''[[film noir]]'' with stylistic touches of the European ''[[nouvelle vague]]''. The film features a fractured time-line, disconcerting narrative rhythms (long, slow passages contrasted with sudden outbursts of violence) and a carefully calculated use of film space (stylized compositions of concrete riverbeds, sweeping bridges, empty prison cells).<ref name=Applegate>Applegate, Tim (2002).

Retrieved 2011-01-19.</ref> Boorman credits Marvin with coming up with a lot of the visual metaphors in the film.<ref name=Commentary/> Boorman said that as the film progressed, scenes would be filmed monochromatically around one particular color (the chilly blues and grays of Acker's apartment, Dickinson's butter yellow bathrobe, the startling red wall in Vernon's penthouse) to give the proceedings a \"sort of unreality\".<ref name=Commentary/><ref name=Applegate/>\n\nTo establish Walker's mythic stature, Soderbergh noted in the commentary that the film cuts from a shot of Walker swimming from Alcatraz to a shot of him on a ferry overlooking the same island while a woman on the loudspeaker describes the impossibility of leaving the island. Soderbergh said that this contrast of the character's ease of escape with the loudspeaker's monologue makes the Walker character \"mythic immediately.\"<ref name=Commentary/>\n\n==Legacy==\n''Point Blank'' is hailed in the book ''[[1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die]]'' as \"The perfect thriller in both form and vision.\"<ref>Schneider, Stephen Jay (Editor) (October 1, 2008).

Souto was shot at [[point-blank range]]. Phrases such as \"Do bullets kill hunger?\", \"Old people in power, young people in coffins\", and \"They killed a student... what if it was your son?\" were written by protesters in the movie posters. The aftermath of Souto's death was one of the first major public protests against the [[Brazilian military government]].<ref>{{in lang|pt}} [http://www.esquerda.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=6807&Itemid=64 \"Brasil 1968: \"Mataram um estudante.
