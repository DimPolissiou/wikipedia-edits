It was a monetary reward paid in accordance with the [[prize law]] of a belligerent state to the crew of a ship belonging to the state, either a warship of its navy or a [[privateer]] vessel commissioned by the state. Prize money was most frequently awarded for the capture of enemy ships or of cargoes belonging to an enemy in time of war, either arrested in port at the outbreak of war or captured during the war in international waters or other waters not the territorial waters of a neutral state. Goods carried in neutral ships that are classed as [[contraband]], being shipped to enemy-controlled territory and liable to be useful to it for making war, were also liable to be taken as prizes, but non-contraband goods belonging to neutrals were not. Claims for the award of prize money were usually heard in a [[Prize Court]], which had to adjudicate the claim and condemn the prize before any distribution of cash or goods could be made to the captors.\n\nOther cases in which prize money has been awarded include prize money for the capture of pirate ships, slave ships after the abolition of the slave trade and ships trading in breach of the [[Navigation Acts]], none of which require a state of war to exist. Similar monetary awards include ''Military Salvage'', the recapture of ships captured by an enemy before an enemy Prize Court has declared them to be valid prizes (after such ships have been condemned, they are treated as enemy ships), and payments termed ''Gun money'', ''Head Money'' or ''[[Bounty (reward)| Bounty]]'', distributed to men serving in a state warship that captured or destroyed of an armed enemy ship. The amount payable depended at first on the number of guns the enemy carried, but later on the complement of the defeated ship. \n\nCertain captures made by armies, called ''Booty of War'', are distinct from naval prize because, unlike awards under naval prize legislation, the award of booty is only made for a specific capture, often the storming of a city; the award does not set a precedent for other military captures in the same war, and does not require adjudication by a prize court. When the British army and navy acted together, it was normal for instructions to say how any prizes and booty should be shared, and the shares allocated. In this case, combined naval and military force to be dealt with under naval prize law rules.  \n\nAlthough prize law still exists, the payment of prize money to privateers ceased in practice during the second half of the 19th century and prize money for naval personnel was abolished by thise maritime states that had provided it at various times in the late 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. \n\n\n==Origins==\nThe two roots of prize law and the consequent distribution of prize money are the mediaeval maritime codes, such as the [[Book of the Consulate of the Sea| Consolato Del Mare]] and [[Rolls of Oleron]], which codified the customary laws that reserved legal rights over certain property found or captured at sea, in harbour or on the shore for the rulers of maritime states,<ref name = \"Wright 16\"> Wright 16</ref> and the 16th and 17th century formulation of international law by jurists such as [[Hugo Grotius]].<ref name = \"Wright 23\"> Wright 23</ref>. These jurists considered that only the state could authorise war, and that goods captured from an enemy in war belong as of right to its monarch. However, it was customary for the state to reward those who that assisted in making such captures by granting them part of the proceeds.<ref name = \"Wright 21-23\"> Wright 21-23</ref>\n\nIn various 17th century states, the crown retained from one-tenth to one-fifth of the value of ships and cargoes taken by privateers but up to half of the value of those captured by the state\u2019s navy. Grotius also recorded the practices that, for a prize to be effective, the ship must either be brought to port or retained for 24 hours, and that no distribution of prize money or goods could made without due court authorisation.<ref name = \"Wright 22, 24\"> Wright 22, 24</ref>  \n\nMost European maritime states, and other maritime states that adopted laws based on European models, had codes of prize law based on the above principles that allowed for monetary rewards for captures. However, details of prize money law and practice are known for relatively few of these. They include [[England|English]] rules from the 17th century, which formed the basis for the rules for [[Great Britain]] and the [[United Kingdom]] in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, those of [[France]] from the 17th to 20th centuries, the [[Dutch Republic]], mainly for the 17th century, and the [[United States]] for the 18th and 19th centuries.<ref name = \"Wright 27\"> Wright 27</ref> The smaller navies of maritime states such as Denmark and Sweden, had little chance of gaining prize money because they had few opportunities to capture enemy ships in wartime, both because, after the [[Great Northern War]], they were rarely involved in naval wars and, when they were, their fleets were much weaker than their major opponents.<ref name = \"Wilson, Hammar & Seerup 5, 163-164\"> Wilson, Hammar & Seerup 5, 163-164</ref>    \n\n===Booty of war===\nBooty of war, also termed ''spoils of war'' is the movable property of an enemy state or its subjects which can be used for warlike purposes, in particular its soldiers' arms and equipment, captured on land, as opposed to ''prize'' which is hostile property captured at sea. It is legally the property of the victorious state, but all or part of it (or its value) may be granted to the troops that capture it.<ref name = \"Phillimore, 214-215\"> Phillimore, 214-215</ref> In British practice, although the Crown may grant booty and to specify its distribution, this was done by a special proclamation relating to a specific capture which did not set a precedent, not a general measure dealing with all captures made during a war, as were naval Prize Acts.<ref name = \"Van Niekerk, 123\"> Van Niekerk, 123</ref> Instances of it being granted include the [[Siege of Seringapatam]], 1799, the capture of [[Bordeaux]], 1814 and the [[Siege of Delhi]], 1857.<ref name = \"Phillimore, 214-215\"> Phillimore, 214-215</ref>. Although the United States and France had allowed their soldiers to profit from booty on a basis similar to Britain, they abolished the practice in 1899 and 1901 respectively.<ref name = \"Phillimore, 227-229\"> Phillimore, 227-229</ref>. The [[Third Geneva Convention]] now only allows the arms, military equipment and military documents of prisoners of war to be seized and prohibits the award of booty.\n\n==England to 1707==\n[[The Crown]] of England had, from medieval times, legal rights over certain property found or captured at sea or found on the shore. These included the rights to [[shipwrecks]], ships found abandoned at the sea, [[Flotsam, jetsam, lagan and derelict]], enemy ships and goods found in English ports or captured at sea in wartime and goods taken from pirates. At first, these were collectively known as [[Droit| Droits]] of the Crown, but after the creation the office of the [[Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom| High Admiral, later the Lord High Admiral, of England]] in the early 15th century, they were known as Droits of Admiralty, as the Crown granted these rights, and legal jurisdiction the property specified in them, to the Lord Admiral. This jurisdiction ceased in 1702, but the name Droits of Admiralty remained in use.<ref name = \"Holdsworth 559-560\"> Holdsworth 559-560</ref> \n\nEarly Prize Law made little distinction between financial rewards made to officers and men of the Royal Navy and to privateers (civilians authorised to attack enemy shipping by [[Letters of marque]] issued by the Crown), as the former did not exist as a permanent force until the 16th century. Mediaeval rulers had no administrative mechanism to adjudicate prizes or collect the royal share. <ref name = \"Wright 31-33\"> Wright 31-33</ref> The first [[Admiralty Court]] in England with responsibility for prize and prize money issues was created in 1483 and subordinate Vice-Admiralty courts were later set up in British colonies. Appeal from the Court of Admiralty was to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom| Privy Council]]. As the rights over enemy ships or goods are legally prerogatives of the Crown, there are few English or British statues that deal with naval prize money, other than the Prize Acts issued at the start of each war, authorising the Crown to issue orders or proclamations dealing with prize money, and these acts affirm rather than limit the Crown\u2019s rights.<ref name = \"Marsden 91-92\"> Marsden (1915) 91-92</ref>  \n\nFrom Elizabethan times, the Crown insisted that the validity of prizes and their value had to be determined by royal courts, and that it should retain a portion of their value. In some cases, an English ship failing to bring a prize for adjudication was confiscated. Beyond this, it was left to the discretion of the Crown, guided by custom, as to what should be allocated to those taking prizes, and how that prize money should be allocated between the owners, the officers and the crew.<ref name = \"Wright 45-46\"> Wright 45-46</ref>.  Generally, the Crown retained one-tenth of the value of prizes captured by privateers. By ancient custom, the common seamen, but not the officers, of navy vessels had the right of \u2018\u2019free pillage\u2019\u2019, the seizure of the enemy crew\u2019s personal possessions and any goods not stored in the hold.<ref name = \"Marsden 695, 697\"> Marsden (1909) 695, 697</ref> The [[Commonwealth of England| Commonwealth]] attempted to forbid the custom of pillage in 1652, but this rule was impossible to enforce, and the right to pillage was given statutory force after [[The Restoration]].<ref name = \"Wright 51\"> Wright 51</ref>\n\nSome rewards that were previously customary or discretionary for privateers became entitlements 1643, when an ordinance passed by the Commonwealth parliament allowed them to retain any ships and goods captured after adjudication in an Admiralty Court and payment of one-tenth of the value of the prize and customs duties on any goods. A further ordinance of 1649 relating to naval ships, which applied during the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]], entitled seamen and subordinate officers to half the value of a captured enemy warship and ''Gun money'' of between 10 and 20 [[Pound (currency)| pounds]] for every gun on an enemy warship that was sunk, and one third of the value of a captured enemy merchant ship. If a captured enemy warship were repairable at reasonable cost and suitable to add to the English fleet, the Crown might but bought it.<ref name = \"Marsden 37\"> Marsden (1911) 37</ref> However, until 1708, the purchase price was fixed by the Admiralty, whose agents were suspected of valuing them cheaply or inflating the cost of repairs.<ref name = \"Bromley 451\"> Bromley 451</ref> The 1643 ordinance also introduced two new measures: that part of the money not allocated to the ship\u2019s crew would go to the sick and wounded, and that English ships recaptured from an enemy were to be returned to their owner on payment of one-eighth of their value to the ship recapturing them. A further ordinance of 1650 applied these prize money rules to the capture of pirate ships.<ref name = \"Wright 50-51\"> Wright 50-51</ref> \n\nThe provisions of 1643, 1649 and 1650 on the distribution of prize money were repeated after [[The Restoration]] in an act of 1661, which also expressly allowed the custom of pillage, and allowed the Lord Admiral discretion over any money or goods not allocated to the crews. The right of disposing of captured prizes and pre-emption in acquiring their goods was also retained by the Lord Admiral.<ref name = \"Marsden 43-44\"> Marsden (1911) 43-44</ref> \n\n===[[Anglo-Dutch Wars]]===\nEven before the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] formally began, two steps were taken by the English government that that were liable to promote hostility between England and the Netherlands. Firstly, in 1663, the [[Navigation Acts| Navigation Act]], which aimed to restrict Dutch maritime trade, authorised the capture of English or foreign vessels trading in breach of that act as prizes, and allowed Vice-Admiralty Courts in the English colonies to adjudicate their value, and to award one-third of this value to the captor, one third to the colonial governor and one third to the Crown. These overseas Vice-Admiralty Courts were, from 1692, also able to deal with wartime prizes.<ref name = \"Marsden 43-44\"> Marsden (1911) 43-44</ref> Secondly, an [[Order in Council]] of 1644 increased the prize money due to the seamen of English ships that took prizes to 10 [[Shilling (British coin)| shillings]] for each [[ton]] comprised in their [[tonnage]], and gun money of at least 10 pounds a gun for any warship sunk or burned.<ref name = \"Fox 74\"> Fox 74</ref> \n\nAlthough neither [[Charles II of England| Charles II]] nor his brother James, Lord High Admiral since 1660, had been ungenerous to those Royal Navy captains and flag officers that captured enemy ships, giving them a fair allocation of the value of their prizes, the failure to set out a fixed scale of prize money for senior officers led to a scandal in 1665.<ref name = \"Fox 113\"> Fox 113</ref> [[Edward Montagu, 1st Earl of Sandwich| The Earl of Sandwich]] commanded an English fleet that, between 3 September and 9 September, had captured thirteen [[Dutch East India Company]] merchant ships of the [[East Indies]] spice fleet, and had also captured or sunk several of their escorts. Concerned that Charles\u2019s difficult financial position might make him less generous that before, and considering the great value of the cargoes captured, Sandwich, urged on by one of his flag officers, [[Sir William Penn]], agreed that he and Penn should take goods to the value of 4,000 pounds, and that each other flag officer and the three captains that held knighthoods should take goods worth 2,000 pounds, from the captured cargoes: nothing was provided for the untitled captains.<ref name = \"Fox 113-114\"> Fox 113-114</ref> \n\nThis seizure of goods was represented by Sandwich and Penn as a payment on account of their expected prize money, although it was in clear breach of the instructions issued in 1665 at the outbreak of the war that required ships and goods to be declared as lawful prizes by an Admiralty court before any goods in its hold could be removed. Marsden, (1911), pp. 44-45. Three of those officers offered 2,000 pounds of goods refused to take them, and the untitled captains complained against the arrangement. In the course of the removal of goods from the Dutch ships\u2019 holds, many English sailors joined in the plundering, and a large quantity of spices and other valuable goods were stolen or spoilt. The Earl of Sandwich lost his command, and the government lost goods and money that could have been used to send the fleet back to sea.<ref name = \"Fox 115\"> Fox 115</ref>\n\nEnglish privateers were very prominent at sea during the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]], attacking the maritime trade and fisheries on which the United Provinces depended, capturing many Dutch merchant ships. <ref name = \"Fox 69-70\"> Fox 69-70</ref> \n\n===[[War of the Spanish Succession]]===\nThe situation of ships\u2019 captains was remedied by a Prize Act of 1692. This act distinguished between captures made by privateers and by royal ships. Privateers were entitled to retain any ships captured and four-fifths of the goods, surrendering one-fifth of those to the Crown, and it was left to them how they sold their prizes and distributed the proceeds. However, in the case of captures by royal ships, one-third of their value went to the officers and men of the captor, and one third to the king, from which he could reward flag officers. The final one-third was to benefit those sick and wounded, as before, and for the first time was also used to pay dependents of crew members killed and to fund [[Greenwich Hospital]].<ref name = \"Wright 53\"> Wright 53</ref>\n\nThe 1692 act also abolished the ancient right of pillage, standardised gun money at 10 pounds a gun and provided for [[salvage]] to be paid by the owners of English ships recaptured from the enemy. <ref name = \"Marsden 90\"> Marsden (1915) 90</ref> Until 1692, the allocation of the one-third of the value of prize money due to the officers and men lad been a matter of custom, but it was then fixed as one-third (or one-ninth of the total prize money) to the captain, one-third to other officers and one-third to the crew.<ref name =\" Ehrman 129-130\"> Ehrman 129-130</ref>\n\nDuring this war, in 1701, the [[Admiralty]] had established a board of Prize Commissioners, who appointed local prize agents at British and some colonial ports, and were responsible for the custody of ships captured both by privateers and royal ships until these captures were either condemned or released. Although privateers were free to dispose of prize ships and goods after they were condemned and any duties were paid, the Prize Commissioners were responsible for the sale of ships and cargoes captured by royal ships, the valuation of ships or goods acquired for Royal Navy use, and the calculation and payment of prize money. As many naval actions in this war took place in the Mediterranean or Caribbean, some captains disposed of captured ships without bringing them before an Admiralty prize agent, often defrauding their own crews of all or part of their prize money entitlement. A Royal Proclamation of 1702 made captains that failed to act through prize agents liable to court martial and dismissal.<ref name = \"Bromley 449-450\"> Bromley 449-450</ref> If the Admiralty Court found that a seizure was unlawful, the ships and cargo was restored to its owner, and the captor would be responsible for any loss or costs arising.<ref name = \"Malcomson, 64-65\"> Malcomson, 64-65</ref>\n\n==[[Great Britain]], 1707 to 1801== \nAfter the [[Act of Union 1707]] between England and Scotland, the former English prize money rules applied to Great Britain. The War of the Spanish Succession continued until 1714. \n\nAn Act of 1708, generally known as the ''Cruisers and Convoys Act'' was designed to protect British maritime trade by allocating Royal Navy ships to protect [[Convoy|convoys]], by encouraging privateers to assist in protecting convoys and amending the prize rules to encourage naval ships to attack enemy warships, and both Royal Navy ships and privateers to attack enemy privateers and merchant ships.The two main changes to the made under this Act were the abolition of the Crown\u2019s shares in the value of merchant ships and their cargoes captured by naval vessels, and of goods captured by privateers, and the payment of ''Head money'' of 5 pounds for each crew member of a captured or sunk enemy warship, as far as these could be established, replacing gun money. As with other Prize Acts, this ceased to have effect at the end of the War of the Spanish Succession in 1714, although its provisions were largely repeated in subsequent Prize Acts of 1756, 1776, 1780 and 1793, issued at the outbreaks of conflicts or to include new belligerents.<ref name = \"Baugh 113-114\"> Baugh 113-114</ref><ref name = \"Wright 58\"> Wright 58</ref> Occasionally, if an enemy merchant ship were captured where it was difficult to take it to an Admiralty Court or prize agent, the captor might offer to ransom it for 10% to 15% of its estimated value.<ref name = \"Hill, 99\"> Hill, 99</ref>. In 1815, ransoming was prohibited except in case of necessity, for example where an enemy warship were nearby.<ref name = \"Malcomson, 68-69\"> Malcomson, 68-69</ref>   \n\nThe 1708 Act still required captured ships to be placed in the custody of Admiralty prize agents before adjudication by the Admiralty Court, and of paying [[Customs]] duties on captured cargoes. However, once they had paid these duties, Royal Navy captors were free to sell these cargoes at the best prices rather than having to sell them through Admiralty prize agents, as privateers had always been able to do so. The Act also allowed Royal Navy captains, officers and crews to appoint their own experts and prize agents to dispute the value of ships or goods acquired for naval use and collect prize money on their behalf.<ref name = \"Rodger, 128\u2013130\"> Rodger (1986) 128\u2013130</ref> Admiralty appointed prize agents were, however, now entitled to a fee of 2% in Britain and 5% abroad. The various changes brought in by this Act are regarded as the basis for the fortunes made from prize money in the 18th and early 19th centuries.\n<ref name = \"Bromley 451-452\"> Bromley 451-452</ref>.\n\n===Distribution===\nIn the Georgian navy, shares of prize money were based on rank. As there were few senior of\ufb01cers, their individual shares were larger than junior officers and very much larger than those of the seamen. The percentages of prize money granted to senior of\ufb01cers were generally higher in the 18th century than in most of the 19th century. Although shares varied over time, and captains within a \ufb02eet or squadron could agree alternative sharing arrangements, in the 18th century, an admiral could generally receive one-eighth of the value of all prizes taken by his fleet or squadron, and if there were more than one admiral, they would share that eighth. A captain usually received one-quarter of the value his prize, or three-eighths if not under the command of an admiral. The distribution for other officers and men was less detailed than it later became: other other of\ufb01cer shared another quarter and the crew shared the remainder. Any ships within sight of a battle also participated in the sharing of prize money, and any unclaimed prize money was allocated to [[Greenwich Hospital, London| Greenwich Hospital]].<ref name = \"Allen, 213\"> Allen, 213</ref>  \n\nDuring the [[Seven Years' War]], the crews of privateers operating from the British colonies in America and the Caribbean were often paid wages as well as a share of prize money, but the crews of those operating from British ports usually received no wages and the cost the provisions they consumed was deducted from their prize money. The owners of privateers generally took half the value of any prize and also charged a further 10% to cover prize agents' fees and other commissions. The captain received 8% of the value by custom, leaving 32% to be shared by the other officers and crew. It was common practice to divide this into shares, with the officers receiving several times as much as seamen, their relative shares being agreed at the start of the voyage.<ref name = \"Rodger, 97, 312\"> Rodger (1986) 97, 312</ref>\n\n===Notable awards, 1707 to 1801=== \nPerhaps the greatest amount of prize money awarded for the capture of a single ship was for that of the [[Spanish frigate Hermione|Spanish frigate ''Hermione'']] on 31 May 1762 by the British frigate {{HMS|Active|1758|2}} and sloop {{HMS|Favourite|1757|2}}. The two captains, [[Herbert Sawyer (1730\u20131798)|Herbert Sawyer]] and [[Philemon Pownoll]], received about \u00a365,000 apiece, while each seaman and Marine got \u00a3482 to 485.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hillsdalesites.org/personal/hstewart/war/Navy3/1762-Hermione.htm |title=Capture of The Hermione |accessdate=2008-08-04 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422014607/http://www.hillsdalesites.org/personal/hstewart/war/Navy3/1762-Hermione.htm |archivedate=April 22, 2009 }} </ref><ref name=hms>{{cite web |url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxoaXN0b3JpY2FsbWFyaXRpbWVzb2NpZXR5fGd4OjQ3NzRiYTAyMmRjNjFiOGM |title=Nelson and His Navy \u2013 Prize Money |publisher=The Historical Maritime Society |accessdate=2008-08-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23496 |title=How Britannia Came to Rule the Waves |author=W.

Each of the 42 naval captains present received \u00a31,600.<ref name = \"Rodger, 247-248\"> Rodger (1986) 247-248</ref>\n\nThe prize money from [[Action of 16 October 1799|the capture of the Spanish frigates ''Thetis'' and ''Santa Brigada'']] in October 1799, \u00a3652,000, was split up among the crews of four British frigates, with each captain being awarded \u00a340,730 and the Seamen each receiving \u00a3182 4s 9\u00bed or the equivalent of 10 years' pay.<ref name = \"Rodger, 524\"> Rodger (2005) 524</ref>\n\n==[[United Kingdom]] from 1801==\nAfter the [[Act of Union 1801]] between Great Britain and Ireland, the former prize money rules of Great Britain applied to the United Kingdom. The [[Treaty of Amiens]] of March 1802 ended the hostilities of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and those of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] commenced in May 1803, when the United Kingdom declared war in France.\n \nPrize Acts at the start of war with France and Spain repeated the provisions of the 1793 Act, which in turn largely repeated those of 1708.<ref name = \"Wright 59\"> Wright 59</ref> The basis of distribution under these acts is detailed in the next section. However, a proclamation of 1812 soon after the start of the [[War of 1812]] made a further revision to the rules on allocation, such that the admiral and captain jointly received one-quarter of the prize money with one-third of this going to the admiral, a reduction from their previous entitlement. The Master and lieutenants received one-eighth of the prize money, as did the warrant officers. The crew below warrant officer rank now shared one-half of the prize money. However, this group was subdivided into several grades, from senior petty officers down to boys, with the higher grades gaining at the expense of the lower ones. <ref name = \"Hill, 204-205\"> Hill, 204-205</ref> The Prize Act of 1815, issued after [[Napoleon]]\u2019s return from Elba, largely repeated the allocation below the flag officers\u2019 share into eight grades and, although it lapsed in the same year, its provisions were re-enacted in 1854 at the start of the [[Crimean War]].<ref name = \"Wright 60-61\"> Wright 60-61</ref>\n\nThe multiplicity of prize money grades survived until 1918, with some refinements to include new ratings required for steamships. The Naval Agency and Distribution Act of 1864 was a permanent Act, rather than one enacted at the start of a particular conflict, stating that prize money was to be distributed according to a [[Royal Proclamation]] or [[Order in Council]] issued when appropriate.<ref name = \" Lushington 106-107, 109-111\"> Lushington, 106-107</ref> This act made no provision for privateers as the United Kingdom had signed the [[Paris Declaration Respecting Maritime Law| Declaration of Paris]], which outlawed privateering by the ships of signatory nations.<ref name = \"Parillo 62-63\"> Parillo (2007), 62-63</ref> The [[Royal Proclamation]] on the division of prize money dated 19 May 1866 provided for a single admiral to receive, or several admiral to share, one-thirtieth of the prize money pool; a single captain or commanding officer to receive, or several share, one-tenth of the pool, and the residue to be allocated to officers and ratings in 10 classes in specified shares.<ref name = \" Lushington 109-111\"> Lushington, 109-111</ref>\n\nThe Prize Courts Acts of 1894 provided that regulations for setting up of Prize Courts and on prize money should in future be initiated at the start of any war only by an [[Order in Council]] and not by Royal Proclamation. The Naval Prize Act 1918 changed the system to one where the prize money was no longer paid to the crews of individual ships, but into a common fund from which a payment was made to all naval personnel. The Act also stated that no distribution until after the end of the war. The award of prize money in the two World Wars were governed by this legislation, which was further modified in 1945 to allow for the distribution to be made to [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) personnel who had been involved in the capture of enemy ships. The Prize Act, 1948 abolished the Crown prerogative of granting prize money or any money arising from Droits of the Crown in wartime. <ref name = \" O\u2019Hare 116-117\"> O\u2019Hare 116-117</ref>\n\nFor more on the Prize Court during [[World War I]], ''see also'' [[Maxwell Hendry Maxwell-Anderson]].\n\n===Anti-slavery===\nAfter the British abolition of the slave trade in 1807, an additional source of prize money arose when Royal Navy ships of the [[West Africa Squadron]] captured slave ships. Under an Order in Council of 1808, the government paid 60 [[Pound sterling| pounds]] for each male slave freed, 30 pounds for each woman and 10 pounds for each child aged under 14. This was paid in lieu of any prize money for the captured slave ship, which became the property of the British government, and it was allocated in the same proportions as other prize money. Between 1807 and 1811, 1,991 slaves were freed through the Vice-Admiralty Court of [[Sierra Leone]], and between 1807 and mid-1815, [[HM Treasury]] paid Royal Navy personnel 191,100 pounds in prize money for slaves freed in West Africa. Condemned slave ships were usually auctioned at Freetown and re-registered as British ships.<ref name = \"Allen, 213\"> Allen, 213</ref><ref name = \"Helfman, 1143-1144\"> Helfman, 1143-1144</ref> However, in 1825, the bounty for all slaves was reduced to a flat rate of 10 pounds, and it was further reduced to 5 pounds for each live slave in 1830. The decline in captures prompted an increase in prize money in 1839 to 5 pounds for each slave landed alive, half that sum for slaves that had died and one pound and ten [[Shilling (British coin)| shillings]] for each ton of the captured vessel\u2019s [[tonnage]].<ref name = \"Lloyd, 79-81\"> Lloyd 79-81</ref>. \n\n===Distribution===\n[[File:Warrantchart.png|thumb|Command structure of a Navy ship c. 1810, showing prize money groupings]]\nThe following scheme for distribution of prize money was used for much of the [[Napoleonic wars]] until 1812, the heyday of prize warfare. Allocation was by eighths. Two eighths of the prize money went to the [[Captain (naval)|captain]] or commander, generally propelling him upwards in political and financial circles. One eighth of the money went to the [[admiral]] or commander-in-chief who signed the ship's written orders (unless the orders came directly from the [[Admiralty]] in London, in which case this eighth also went to the captain). One eighth was divided among the [[lieutenant]]s, [[sailing master]], and [[Captain (land)|captain of marines]], if any. One eighth was divided among the  wardroom warrant officers ([[Ship's doctor|surgeon]], [[purser]], and [[chaplain]]), standing warrant officers ([[carpenter]], [[boatswain]], and [[Gunner (rank)|gunner]]), [[lieutenant|lieutenant of marines]], and the [[master's mate]]s.  One eighth was divided among the junior warrant and petty officers, their mates, sergeants of marines, [[captain's clerk]], [[surgeon's mate]]s, and [[midshipman|midshipmen]]. The final two eighths were divided among the crew, with able and specialist seamen receiving larger shares than ordinary seamen, landsmen, and boys.<ref name=\"lavery135136\">*{{cite book|last=Lavery|first=Brian|title=Nelson's Navy: The Ships, Men and Organization|year=1989|location=Annapolis, MD |publisher=Naval Institute Press|isbn=0-87021-258-3|oclc=20997619|url=https://archive.org/details/nelsonsnavyships00lave|url-access=registration|quote=Nelson's Navy Lavery.|accessdate=2009-05-19|pages=[https://archive.org/details/nelsonsnavyships00lave/page/135 135]\u2013136}}</ref><ref name = \"Rodger, 522\u2013524\">Rodger (205) 522\u2013524</ref> The pool for the seamen was divided into shares, with each able seaman getting two shares in the pool (referred to as a fifth-class share), an ordinary seaman received a share and a half (referred to as a sixth-class share), landsmen received a share each (a seventh-class share), and boys received a half share each (referred to as an eighth-class share).\n\nA notable prize award related to a capture in January 1807, when the frigate ''Caroline'' took the Spanish ship ''San Rafael'' as a prize, netting Captain Peter Rainier \u00a352,000.<ref name=hms />\n\n===Operational difficulties===\nFor much of the 18th century and until 1815, the main complaints about prize money concerned delays in its payment and practices that deprived ordinary seamen of much of what was due to them. Although the incidence of captains selling captured ships abroad and defrauding crews of prize money reduced greatly in the course of the century, payment was often by way of a promissory note, or ''ticket'' to be paid when the relevant naval department had funds. Although officers could generally afford to wait for payment, which was often made only in London and sometimes in instalments that might stretch over several years, most seamen sold their promissory notes at a large discount.<ref name = \"Bromley 474-476\"> Bromley 474-476</ref> Other seamen authorised another individual to collect their prize money, who did not always passed it on, or lost out when they transferred to a new ship, if their prize money were not forwarded. A final issue of contention was that the value of prizes assessed in overseas Vice-Admiralty courts could be reassessed in the Admiralty Court in Britain if the Admiralty appealed the initial valuation. Excessive valuations in Vice-Admiralty courts, particularly in the West Indies, arose because the courts charged fees based on the prizes' values.<ref name = \"Rodger, 317-318\"> Rodger (1986) 317-318</ref>This led to delays and possible reduced payments.<ref name = \"Malcomson, 65-66\"> Malcomson, 65-66</ref> \n\nTo some extent, delays arose from the time taken by Vice-Admiralty courts adjudicating whether captured ships were legitimate prizes and, if they were, their value. In the [[War of 1812]], the Vice-Admiralty courts at [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] and, to a lesser extent, [[Bermuda]] had to deal with many, often small, American ships captured both by privateers and naval vessels, leading to lengthy legal delays in adjudication. Once an adjudication was made, providing there was no appeal, the funds from the sale of a captured ship or its goods should have been available for payment within two years, but the whole process from capture to payment might take three years or more. <ref name = \"Malcomson, 63-64\"> Malcomson, 63-64</ref> \n\nUnder the so-called ''joint capture''rules, which did not apply to privateers, any Royal Navy ship present when a capture took place was entitled to share in the prize money. However, this rule led to disputes where, for example, three claimant ships had been pursuing the captured ship but were out of sight when another captured it, or where a squadron commander claimed a share in a prize captured by his subordinate in disobedience to that commander\u2019s orders. In order to minimise disputes, some captains and crews of ships on the same mission made time-limited agreements to share prize money.<ref name = \"Malcomson, 64-65\"> Malcomson, 64-65</ref> In the case of privateers, for one to claim a share of prize money, it had to give actual assistance to the ship making the capture unless there were a prior agreement between privateers to share prizes.<ref name = \"Van Niekerk, 119\"> Van Niekerk 119</ref>\n\n==Scotland and Ireland==\n\n===Scotland=== \nThe [[Kingdom of Scotland]] had its own [[Lord High Admiral of Scotland| Lord High Admiral]] from mediaeval times until 1707, except for the period 1652 to 1661. His jurisdiction over Scottish ships, waters and coasts, exercised through a High Court of Admiralty, was similar to that of his English equivalent.<ref name = \"Murdoch, 10, 237\"> Murdoch 10 237</ref> In 1652, the [[Royal Scots Navy| Scottish fleet]] that was absorbed into the Commonwealth fleet and, although a separate Scottish Admiralty was re-established in 1661, it had no warships designed as such until three relatively small ones were commissioned in 1696.<ref name = \"Murdoch, 230, 236\"> Murdoch 230 236</ref>\n\nHowever, as Scotland was involved in the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War|Second]] (1665\u201367) and [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]]s (1672\u201374) against the Dutch and their allies, the Scottish Admiralty commissioned a significant number of privateers after 1665 by issuing  [[Letters of marque]]. <ref name = \"Murdoch, 27, 238-240\"> Murdoch 27, 238-240</ref> At least 80 privateers operating from Scottish ports in these two wars have been identified, and contemporaries estimated as many as 120 may have operated against Dutch and Danish merchant ships, including some English ships operating under Scottish commissions.<ref name = \"Murdoch, 240-241\"> Murdoch 240-241</ref> Apart from ships of the [[Dutch East India Company]], many Dutch merchant ships and of its Danish ally were poorly armed and undermanned. Most of these engaged in Atlantic trade had to sail around the north of Scotland to avoid the English Channel in wartime, and the Dutch whaling and herring fleets operated in waters north and east of Scotland, so they were vulnerable Scottish privateers, who were particularly successful in the Second Anglo-Dutch War.<ref name = \"Graham, 69-70\"> Graham 69-70</ref> The owners of privateering vessels, were entitled to the greater part of the value of their prizes, as their ordinary seamen usually served for wages rather than a share of prize money.<ref name = \"Murdoch, 177\"> Murdoch 177</ref> \n\n===Ireland===\nAdmirals of Ireland were appointed in the later middle ages and from the late 16th century, these admirals became the Irish representatives of the Lord Admiral of England, and were sometimes referred to as the Vice-Admiral of Ireland, but had no control over the royal fleet in Irish waters. Ireland also had its own Admiralty Court, mainly staffed by English admiralty officials and with a jurisdiction was broadly similar to that of its English counterpart.<ref name = \"Appleby & O'Dowd, 229-300\"> Appleby & O'Dowd 229-300</ref> Much of its activities concerned the many pirates operating off the coast of Ireland during the late 16th and early 17th centuries. The Irish Admiralty had no ships of its own and no authority to issue Letters marque to privateers, but could seize and condemn pirate and enemy ships in Irish ports.<ref name = \"Appleby & O'Dowd, 307, 315-316\"> Appleby & O'Dowd 307, 315-316</ref> \n\nThe Irish Admiralty was granted permission to establish a prize court at the time of the Second Anglo-Dutch War, which was considered to be the equivalent of the Vice-Admiralty courts in British colonies.<ref name = \"Costello, 40\"> Costello 40</ref> At the outbreak of the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] in 1744, the Irish Admiralty Court managed to extend its powers and jurisdiction by obtaining independent prize jurisdiction and enhancing its status from that of a Vice-Admiralty to that of an independent court.<ref name = \"Costello, 23, 26\"> Costello 23, 26</ref>\n\n==France==\nIn France, prize jurisdiction lay with the Admiral of France until that office was suppressed in 1627. A commission of jurists, the Prize Council (''Conseil des Prises''), was established in 1659 to deal with the adjudication of all prizes and the distribution of prize money, although many French privateers tried to evade its scrutiny.<ref name = \" Cormack, 76\"> Cormack 76</ref> Cormack (2002), p.76. The Prize Council only functioned in times of war until 1861: it then became permanent until its dissolution in 1965.<ref>Archives du Conseil des Prises 1854 to 1965//https://francearchives.fr/fr/findingaid/f0164f7014d16d2cb68bc56607a6700eebf6c874</ref>\n\nAlthough officers and men of the French Navy were, in principle, entitled to prize money, and depriving men of prize money due to them was an established disciplinary measure, awards were relatively rare.<ref name = \"Cormack, 27\"> Cormack 27</ref> During the 17th and 18th centuries, French naval strategy alternated between that of ''Guerre d\u2019Escadre'', maintaining a fully-equipped battle fleet for control of the sea, and ''Guerre de Course'', sometimes using naval ships but more often privateers, including smaller naval warships leased to private individuals, to destroy an enemy\u2019s maritime commerce. Although these alternatives had a strategic basis, only Guerre de Course was viable when financial problems prevented the maintenance of a battle fleet.<ref name = \"Symcox, 3-5\"> Symcox 3-5</ref> Even when it was possible to equip a battle fleet, the French naval doctrine that a fleet must avoid any action that might prevent it carrying out its designated mission, prioritised defensive tactics which made captures and prize money unlikely.<ref name = \"Jenkins, 108, 342\"> Jenkins 108, 342</ref>\n\nWhen a policy of commerce raiding was adopted, the major warships were laid up, but many of the smaller warships manned by the officers and men of the French Navy, were leased by the French Crown to contractors, who paid the fitting-out and running costs of these ships, and agreed to pay the Crown one-fifth of the value of all captures.<ref name = \"Jenkins, 100-102\"> Jenkins 100-102</ref> Jenkins (1973), These ships were, however, regarded as privateers, and other privateers were entirely financed by private individuals: in both cases, the privateers operated as their owners and lessees wished, outside if government control. Privateering denied the French Navy of recruits who were experienced seamen, already in short supply in France.<ref name = \" Cormack, 25\"> Cormack 25</ref>\n\nUnder an ordinance of 1681, privateers, both those using their own ships and those leasing royal ships were required to register with an officer of the Admiralty and make a substantial cautionary deposit. Any prize obtained by a privateer was to be surveyed by representatives of the Prize Council, who would recover their costs out of the sale proceeds, and retain a tenth of the net proceeds as the Admiralty portion.<ref name = \"Vallan, 4-6\"> Vallan 4-6</ref> Officers and men of the French Royal Navy were entitled to share four-fifths of the value of a merchant ship captured, with one tenth of the proceeds retained by the Admiralty and a further tenth for sick and injured seamen.

The [[Lieutenant-Admiral]] of an admiralty generally received four times as much as the captain responsible for a capture, and the [[Vice-Admiral]] twice as much: in both cases, these flag-officers shared in all ships and goods taken by captains in their admiralties, even when not present at the capture.<ref name = \" Bruijn, 44, 104\"> Bruijn(2011) 44, 104</ref> In 1640, [[Maarten Tromp]], a Lieutenant-Admiral was owed 13,800 [[guilders]], mostly his share of prize money from the [[Battle of the Downs]] the previous year. \n\nBoth captains and flag officers in the Dutch fleet sometimes put the pursuit of prize money before discipline. In the [[Four Days' Battle]] of June 1666, several Dutch ships left the fleet either towing English ships they had captured or in pursuit of prizes, <ref name = \"Fox 212, 218\"> Fox 212, 218</ref> and [[Cornelis Tromp]] was extremely reluctant to burn {{HMS|Prince Royal|1610|6}} after it had run aground and been damaged, despite the orders of his commander, [[Michiel de Ruyter]].

In many cases, Dutch privateers attempted to evade the prize rules, by attacking neutral or even Dutch ships, failing to bring captures or their cargoes for adjudication and removing and selling cargoes to avoid paying duties.<ref name = \"Lunsford, 155-156\"> Lunsford, 155-156</ref> Privateers licenced by the two Dutch India companies were aggressive in attacking what they termed ''interlopers'' in their areas of operations, regardless of nationality, and both companies were active in privateering in the three Anglo-Dutch wars. .<ref name = \"Lunsford, 183-184\"> Lunsford 183-184</ref> \n\nDuring the [[Eighty Years' War]], the main targets of Dutch privateers were Spanish and Portuguese ships, including those of the [[Spanish Netherlands]]. Privateers licenced by the West India Company were very active against ships trading with Brazil. <ref name = \"Klooster, 43-44\"> Klooster 43-44</ref> The privateers that had attacked Portuguese shipping had to cease doing so after the 1661 [[Treaty of The Hague]], but many quickly transferred their activities to attacking English shipping after 1665 during the Second and Third Anglo-Dutch wars. <ref name = \"Bruijn, 145\"> Bruijn (2011) 145</ref>. However, there was relatively little Dutch privateering after the end of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], a consequence of the general decline in Dutch maritime activity. <ref name = \"Bruijn, 56\"> Bruijn (2008) 56</ref>\n\n==United States==\n===To 1814===\nDuring the Revolutionary War period, the [[Continental Congress]] had no navy and relied heavily on privateers who had been authorised by one of the states to capture British ships. Admiralty Courts for the state that had authorised the privateer adjudicated on the ownership of captured vessels and their value. <ref name = \"Mask & Mac Mahon, 477, 480\"> Mask & Mac Mahon 477, 480</ref> The [[Continental Navy]], formed in 1775 was small and outmatched by the Royal Navy, whereas American privateers captured about 600 British merchant ships in the course of this conflict. <ref name = \"Mask & Mac Mahon, 487\"> Mask & Mac Mahon 487</ref>  In 1787, the US Constitution transferred the right to grant [[Letters of Marque]] from the states to Congress. <ref name = \"Parrillo, 3\"> Parrillo (2007) 3</ref>  \n\nAt the start of the [[War of 1812]], the few larger US Navy ships were laid-up, while the Royal Navy had relatively few resources available in the western Atlantic, leaning the field free for privateers on both sides.<ref name = \"Kert, 7-8\"> Kert 7-8</ref> However, once the US Navy frigates were brought back into commission, they achieved some spectacular successes against weaker British frigates, with [[Stephen Decatur]] and [[John Rodgers (1772-1838)| John Rodgers]] both receiving over 10,000 dollars in prize money.<ref name = \"Kert, 114\"> Kert 114</ref> However, later in the war, the Royal Navy succeeded in blockading the US [[Eastern seaboard]] and capturing several US Navy vessels and a number of merchant ships, and also stifling American privateer activity, although single US Navy warships managed to avoid the blockade and attack British shipping in the [[Caribbean]] and off South America.<ref name = \"Kert, 115-116\"> Kert 116-116</ref> \n\nFrom the inception of its navy, the United States government granted naval personnel additional payments of two kinds, prize money, being a share in the proceeds from captured enemy merchant vessels and their cargo, and head money, a cash reward from the US Treasury for sinking enemy warships. From 1791, US Navy personnel received half the proceeds of a prize of equal or inferior force, and all the proceeds of a vessel of superior force. Privateers, in contrast, received all the proceeds of any prize, but had to pay duties that rose to 40% during the War of 1812, although they were lower at other times. Generally, half of the net amount went to the owners of the privateer, half to the crew.<ref name = \"Parillo 24\"> Parillo (2007), 24</ref> From 1800, US Navy ships that sunk an armed enemy ship received a bounty of twenty dollars for each enemy crew member at the start of the action, divided among the crew of that ship in the same proportions as other prize money.<ref name = \"Parillo 25\"> Parillo (2007), 25</ref>\n\n===Distribution===\nUnder United States legislation of 1800, whether the officers and men of the navy ship or ships responsible for the capturing a prize were entitled to half of the assessed value of the prize, or the whole value in the case of a capture of superior force, the prize money fund was to be allocated in specified proportions. The captain or captains of vessels taking prizes were entitled to 10% of the prize money fund, and the commander of the squadron to 5% of the fund. In the event that the captain was operating independently, he received 15% of the prize fund. Naval lieutenants, captains of marines and sailing Masters were to share 10%, increased to approximately 12% if there were no lieutenants of marines. Chaplains, lieutenants of marines, surgeons, pursers, boatswains, gunners, carpenters, and master\u2019s mates shared 10% of the prize fund, reduced to approximately 8% if there were no lieutenants of marines. Midshipman, junior warrant offices and the mates of senior warrant officers shared 17.5% and a range of petty officers a further 12.5%. This left 35% for the rest of the crew. Any unclaimed prize money was to be retained jointly by the Navy and Treasury secretaries to fund disability pensions and [[half-pay]].<ref name = \"Peters, 47-48, Articles V, VI, IX and X\"> Peters 47-48, Articles V, VI, IX and X</ref> \n \n===From 1815===\nFor most of the period between the end of the War of 1812 and the start of the [[American Civil War]], there was little opportunity to gain prize money. After the outbreak of the Civil War, the [[Confederate States of America| Confederate States]] granted some 30 commissions or Letters of marque to privateers, which captured between 50 and 60 United States merchant ships. However, a declaration by [[Abraham Lincoln]] that [[Confederate privateer]]s would be treated as pirates and the closure of the ports of European colonies in the Caribbean as venues for the disposal of prize vessels and cargoes encoraged their owners to turn to [[Blockade runner| Blockade running]].<ref name = \"Peifer, 98-99\"> Peifer 98-99</ref> \n\nFrom 1861, US Navy ships engaged Confederate privateers and [[Blockade runner]]s: as the 1800 legislation only applied to enemies of the United States, which did not recognise the Confederate States, it was unclear if prize money would apply. However, a revised statute of 1864 stated that \"the provisions of this title shall apply to all captures made as prize by authority of the United States\", allowing prize money claims to be made.<ref name = \"Library of Congress, 315, Section 33\"> Library of Congress, 315, Section 33</ref> Over 11 million dollars of prize money was paid to US Navy personnel for captures in the [[American Civil War| Civil War]] period. It has been calculated that about one-third of prize money due was payable to officers under the prevailing rules, but that approximately half of the money actually paid went to officers, most probably because of the difficulty in tracing enlisted men when payments were delayed.<ref name = \"Parillo 66\"> Parillo (2013), 66</ref>\n\nIn 1856, the [[Paris Declaration Respecting Maritime Law| Declaration of Paris]] was signed: this outlawed privateering by the ships of the 55 nations that signed it. However, the United States did not Spain sign the declaration, in part because it considered that, if privateering were to be abolished, the capture of merchant ships by naval vessels should also cease. Despite this, the United States agreed to respect the declaration during the [[American Civil War]], although [[Abraham Lincoln| Lincoln's]] cabinet did discuss the use of privateers against British merchant shipping in the event Britain recognised the Confederacy.<ref name = \"Parillo 63\"> Parillo (2007) 63</ref> \n\nA number of changes were made to the allocation of prize money to US Navy personnel in the 19th century in the last being in 1864. This preserved the awards 5% of the prize fund to commanders of the squadron, which now also applied to fleet commanders of fleet and of 10% to captains under the immediate command of a flag officer or 15% for those operating independently. It added new awards of 2% for a commander of a division of a fleet under the orders of a fleet commander and 1% for a [[Captain of the fleet| fleet captain]] stationed on the flagship. The most significant change was that the residue of prize money after making these awards was to be divided amongst the remaining officers and men in proportion to their rates of pay. This law also increased the bounty or head money for destroying an enemy warship in action, or any other enemy ship that it was necessary to destroy was increased to 100 dollars for each enemy crew member at the start of the action on a ship of less or equal force, or 200 dollars for each crew member of an enemy ship of greater force, to be divided among the officers and men of the US ship in the same proportions as other prize money.<ref name = \"Library of Congress, 309-301, Sections 10 & 11\"> Library of Congress, 309-301, Sections 10 & 11</ref>\n\nThe small size of US Navy meant that privateering would be the main way it could attack enemy commerce. In the Civil War, Lincoln's cabinet had discussed the use of privateers against British merchant shipping in the event Britain recognised the Confederacy, Until the early 1880s, American naval opinion considered that privateering remained a viable option, although subsequent increases in the size of the US Navy changed this view.<ref name = \"Parillo 4, 10-11\"> Parillo (2007) 4 10-11</ref> \n\nIn the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] of 1898, neither the United States nor Spain issued commissions to privateers. However, the US Navy was granted what were to be last payments of prize money made by the US Treasury for that war. These were to sailors that took part in the battles of [[Battle of Manila Bay| Manila Bay]] and [[Battle of Santiago de Cuba| Santiago]] and divided prize funds of 244,400 dollars and 166,700 dollars respectively, based on the estimated numbers of Spanish sailors and the value of ships salvaged at Manilla.<ref name = \"Knauth, 70, 73\"> Knauth 70, 73</ref>\n\n===Abolition===\nDuring the Spanish American War in 1898, the US Navy was seen by much of the United States population as seeking to profit from prize money and head money to an unacceptable extent, even though the amounts of granted were relatively modest. All awards of prize money and head money to US Navy personnel were abolished by an overwhelming vote of Congress in March 1899, shortly after the Spanish-American War conclded.<ref name = \"Parillo, 47, 308-309\"> Parillo (2013) 47, 308-309</ref> \n\nIt is sometimes claimed that the US Navy last paid prize money in 1947.<ref>Nofi, Al (20 July 2008).

The United States was not at war with Germany at the time, and after the war, the Odenwald\u2019s owners claimed that its seizure was therefore illegal. The Admiralty Court in Puerto Rico, however, ruled in 1947 that the crew\u2019s attempt to scuttle the ship, and then abandon, it meant that the Omaha\u2019s boarding party and salvage party that jointly brought the Odenwald to port had salvage rights, worth approximately 3 million dollars. It also ruled explicitly that it was not a case of bounty or prize.<ref> Justia US Law.

However, between 1775 and 1815, revenues declined sharply, largely because the probability of seizing a prize ship fell dramatically, partly owing to the increasing numbers of naval vessels competing for captures. As outfitting and manning ships for commerce raiding was expensive, privateering became less financially attractive.<ref name = \"Hillmann & Gathmann, 732, 740, 746-748\"> Hillmann & Gathmann 732, 740, 746-748</ref> \n\nThe Declaration of Paris 1856, by outlawing privateering by ships of signatory nations, would have made it politically difficult for non-signatories, which included the United States to commission privateers in a future conflict,<ref name = \"Parillo 63\"> Parillo (2007) 63</ref> and the privateering using metal-hulled steamships presented the additional problems of maintaining complex engines, the need for frequent re-coaling and to repair more complex damage than that experienced by wooden-hulled sailing ships. In addition, after 1880, many maritime countries paid subsidies so that liners and other fast merchant vessels were built with a view to conversion into [[Armed merchantmen | Armed Merchant Cruisers]] under naval control in wartime, which replaced the need for privateers, and no privateers were commissioned after the American Civil War.<ref name = \"Coogan, 22\"> Coogan 22</ref><ref name = \"Parillo, 76-78\"> Parillo (2007) 76-78</ref> \n  \n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n* {{cite journal| first1= J.C.|last1= Appleby |first2=M. |last2=O'Dowd| title = The Irish Admiralty: Its Organisation and Development, c. 1570-1640| journal= Irish Historical Studies| year = 1985| volume=24|issue=96| pages=299-326}}\n* {{cite journal|first= D.

It was a monetary reward paid in accordance with the [[prize law]] of a belligerent state to the crew of a ship belonging to the state, either a warship of its navy or a [[privateer]] vessel commissioned by the state. Prize money was most frequently awarded for the capture of enemy ships or of cargoes belonging to an enemy in time of war, either arrested in port at the outbreak of war or captured during the war in international waters or other waters not the territorial waters of a neutral state. Goods carried in neutral ships that are classed as [[contraband]], being shipped to enemy-controlled territory and liable to be useful to it for making war, were also liable to be taken as prizes, but non-contraband goods belonging to neutrals were not. Claims for the award of prize money were usually heard in a [[Prize Court]], which had to adjudicate the claim and condemn the prize before any distribution of cash or goods could be made to the captors.\n\nOther cases in which prize money has been awarded include prize money for the capture of pirate ships, slave ships after the abolition of the slave trade and ships trading in breach of the [[Navigation Acts]], none of which require a state of war to exist. Similar monetary awards include ''Military Salvage'', the recapture of ships captured by an enemy before an enemy Prize Court has declared them to be valid prizes (after such ships have been condemned, they are treated as enemy ships), and payments termed ''Gun money'', ''Head Money'' or ''[[Bounty (reward)| Bounty]]'', distributed to men serving in a state warship that captured or destroyed of an armed enemy ship. The amount payable depended at first on the number of guns the enemy carried, but later on the complement of the defeated ship. \n\nCertain captures made by armies, called ''Booty of War'', are distinct from naval prize because, unlike awards under naval prize legislation, the award of booty is only made for a specific capture, often the storming of a city; the award does not set a precedent for other military captures in the same war, and does not require adjudication by a prize court. When the British army and navy acted together, it was normal for instructions to say how any prizes and booty should be shared, and the shares allocated. In this case, combined naval and military force to be dealt with under naval prize law rules.  \n\nAlthough prize law still exists, the payment of prize money to privateers ceased in practice during the second half of the 19th century and prize money for naval personnel was abolished by thise maritime states that had provided it at various times in the late 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. \n\n\n==Origins==\nThe two roots of prize law and the consequent distribution of prize money are the mediaeval maritime codes, such as the [[Book of the Consulate of the Sea| Consolato Del Mare]] and [[Rolls of Oleron]], which codified the customary laws that reserved legal rights over certain property found or captured at sea, in harbour or on the shore for the rulers of maritime states,<ref name = \"Wright 16\"> Wright 16</ref> and the 16th and 17th century formulation of international law by jurists such as [[Hugo Grotius]].<ref name = \"Wright 23\"> Wright 23</ref>. These jurists considered that only the state could authorise war, and that goods captured from an enemy in war belong as of right to its monarch. However, it was customary for the state to reward those who that assisted in making such captures by granting them part of the proceeds.<ref name = \"Wright 21-23\"> Wright 21-23</ref>\n\nIn various 17th century states, the crown retained from one-tenth to one-fifth of the value of ships and cargoes taken by privateers but up to half of the value of those captured by the state\u2019s navy. Grotius also recorded the practices that, for a prize to be effective, the ship must either be brought to port or retained for 24 hours, and that no distribution of prize money or goods could made without due court authorisation.<ref name = \"Wright 22, 24\"> Wright 22, 24</ref>  \n\nMost European maritime states, and other maritime states that adopted laws based on European models, had codes of prize law based on the above principles that allowed for monetary rewards for captures. However, details of prize money law and practice are known for relatively few of these. They include [[England|English]] rules from the 17th century, which formed the basis for the rules for [[Great Britain]] and the [[United Kingdom]] in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, those of [[France]] from the 17th to 20th centuries, the [[Dutch Republic]], mainly for the 17th century, and the [[United States]] for the 18th and 19th centuries.<ref name = \"Wright 27\"> Wright 27</ref> The smaller navies of maritime states such as Denmark and Sweden, had little chance of gaining prize money because they had few opportunities to capture enemy ships in wartime, both because, after the [[Great Northern War]], they were rarely involved in naval wars and, when they were, their fleets were much weaker than their major opponents.<ref name = \"Wilson, Hammar & Seerup 5, 163-164\"> Wilson, Hammar & Seerup 5, 163-164</ref>    \n\n===Booty of war===\nBooty of war, also termed ''spoils of war'' is the movable property of an enemy state or its subjects which can be used for warlike purposes, in particular its soldiers' arms and equipment, captured on land, as opposed to ''prize'' which is hostile property captured at sea. It is legally the property of the victorious state, but all or part of it (or its value) may be granted to the troops that capture it.<ref name = \"Phillimore, 214-215\"> Phillimore, 214-215</ref> In British practice, although the Crown may grant booty and to specify its distribution, this was done by a special proclamation relating to a specific capture which did not set a precedent, not a general measure dealing with all captures made during a war, as were naval Prize Acts.<ref name = \"Van Niekerk, 123\"> Van Niekerk, 123</ref> Instances of it being granted include the [[Siege of Seringapatam]], 1799, the capture of [[Bordeaux]], 1814 and the [[Siege of Delhi]], 1857.<ref name = \"Phillimore, 214-215\"> Phillimore, 214-215</ref>. Although the United States and France had allowed their soldiers to profit from booty on a basis similar to Britain, they abolished the practice in 1899 and 1901 respectively.<ref name = \"Phillimore, 227-229\"> Phillimore, 227-229</ref>. The [[Third Geneva Convention]] now only allows the arms, military equipment and military documents of prisoners of war to be seized and prohibits the award of booty.\n\n==England to 1707==\n[[The Crown]] of England had, from medieval times, legal rights over certain property found or captured at sea or found on the shore. These included the rights to [[shipwrecks]], ships found abandoned at the sea, [[Flotsam, jetsam, lagan and derelict]], enemy ships and goods found in English ports or captured at sea in wartime and goods taken from pirates. At first, these were collectively known as [[Droit| Droits]] of the Crown, but after the creation the office of the [[Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom| High Admiral, later the Lord High Admiral, of England]] in the early 15th century, they were known as Droits of Admiralty, as the Crown granted these rights, and legal jurisdiction the property specified in them, to the Lord Admiral. This jurisdiction ceased in 1702, but the name Droits of Admiralty remained in use.<ref name = \"Holdsworth 559-560\"> Holdsworth 559-560</ref> \n\nEarly Prize Law made little distinction between financial rewards made to officers and men of the Royal Navy and to privateers (civilians authorised to attack enemy shipping by [[Letters of marque]] issued by the Crown), as the former did not exist as a permanent force until the 16th century. Mediaeval rulers had no administrative mechanism to adjudicate prizes or collect the royal share. <ref name = \"Wright 31-33\"> Wright 31-33</ref> The first [[Admiralty Court]] in England with responsibility for prize and prize money issues was created in 1483 and subordinate Vice-Admiralty courts were later set up in British colonies. Appeal from the Court of Admiralty was to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom| Privy Council]]. As the rights over enemy ships or goods are legally prerogatives of the Crown, there are few English or British statues that deal with naval prize money, other than the Prize Acts issued at the start of each war, authorising the Crown to issue orders or proclamations dealing with prize money, and these acts affirm rather than limit the Crown\u2019s rights.<ref name = \"Marsden 91-92\"> Marsden (1915) 91-92</ref>  \n\nFrom Elizabethan times, the Crown insisted that the validity of prizes and their value had to be determined by royal courts, and that it should retain a portion of their value. In some cases, an English ship failing to bring a prize for adjudication was confiscated. Beyond this, it was left to the discretion of the Crown, guided by custom, as to what should be allocated to those taking prizes, and how that prize money should be allocated between the owners, the officers and the crew.<ref name = \"Wright 45-46\"> Wright 45-46</ref>.  Generally, the Crown retained one-tenth of the value of prizes captured by privateers. By ancient custom, the common seamen, but not the officers, of navy vessels had the right of \u2018\u2019free pillage\u2019\u2019, the seizure of the enemy crew\u2019s personal possessions and any goods not stored in the hold.<ref name = \"Marsden 695, 697\"> Marsden (1909) 695, 697</ref> The [[Commonwealth of England| Commonwealth]] attempted to forbid the custom of pillage in 1652, but this rule was impossible to enforce, and the right to pillage was given statutory force after [[The Restoration]].<ref name = \"Wright 51\"> Wright 51</ref>\n\nSome rewards that were previously customary or discretionary for privateers became entitlements 1643, when an ordinance passed by the Commonwealth parliament allowed them to retain any ships and goods captured after adjudication in an Admiralty Court and payment of one-tenth of the value of the prize and customs duties on any goods. A further ordinance of 1649 relating to naval ships, which applied during the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]], entitled seamen and subordinate officers to half the value of a captured enemy warship and ''Gun money'' of between 10 and 20 [[Pound (currency)| pounds]] for every gun on an enemy warship that was sunk, and one third of the value of a captured enemy merchant ship. If a captured enemy warship were repairable at reasonable cost and suitable to add to the English fleet, the Crown might but bought it.<ref name = \"Marsden 37\"> Marsden (1911) 37</ref> However, until 1708, the purchase price was fixed by the Admiralty, whose agents were suspected of valuing them cheaply or inflating the cost of repairs.<ref name = \"Bromley 451\"> Bromley 451</ref> The 1643 ordinance also introduced two new measures: that part of the money not allocated to the ship\u2019s crew would go to the sick and wounded, and that English ships recaptured from an enemy were to be returned to their owner on payment of one-eighth of their value to the ship recapturing them. A further ordinance of 1650 applied these prize money rules to the capture of pirate ships.<ref name = \"Wright 50-51\"> Wright 50-51</ref> \n\nThe provisions of 1643, 1649 and 1650 on the distribution of prize money were repeated after [[The Restoration]] in an act of 1661, which also expressly allowed the custom of pillage, and allowed the Lord Admiral discretion over any money or goods not allocated to the crews. The right of disposing of captured prizes and pre-emption in acquiring their goods was also retained by the Lord Admiral.<ref name = \"Marsden 43-44\"> Marsden (1911) 43-44</ref> \n\n===[[Anglo-Dutch Wars]]===\nEven before the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] formally began, two steps were taken by the English government that that were liable to promote hostility between England and the Netherlands. Firstly, in 1663, the [[Navigation Acts| Navigation Act]], which aimed to restrict Dutch maritime trade, authorised the capture of English or foreign vessels trading in breach of that act as prizes, and allowed Vice-Admiralty Courts in the English colonies to adjudicate their value, and to award one-third of this value to the captor, one third to the colonial governor and one third to the Crown. These overseas Vice-Admiralty Courts were, from 1692, also able to deal with wartime prizes.<ref name = \"Marsden 43-44\"> Marsden (1911) 43-44</ref> Secondly, an [[Order in Council]] of 1644 increased the prize money due to the seamen of English ships that took prizes to 10 [[Shilling (British coin)| shillings]] for each [[ton]] comprised in their [[tonnage]], and gun money of at least 10 pounds a gun for any warship sunk or burned.<ref name = \"Fox 74\"> Fox 74</ref> \n\nAlthough neither [[Charles II of England| Charles II]] nor his brother James, Lord High Admiral since 1660, had been ungenerous to those Royal Navy captains and flag officers that captured enemy ships, giving them a fair allocation of the value of their prizes, the failure to set out a fixed scale of prize money for senior officers led to a scandal in 1665.<ref name = \"Fox 113\"> Fox 113</ref> [[Edward Montagu, 1st Earl of Sandwich| The Earl of Sandwich]] commanded an English fleet that, between 3 September and 9 September, had captured thirteen [[Dutch East India Company]] merchant ships of the [[East Indies]] spice fleet, and had also captured or sunk several of their escorts. Concerned that Charles\u2019s difficult financial position might make him less generous that before, and considering the great value of the cargoes captured, Sandwich, urged on by one of his flag officers, [[Sir William Penn]], agreed that he and Penn should take goods to the value of 4,000 pounds, and that each other flag officer and the three captains that held knighthoods should take goods worth 2,000 pounds, from the captured cargoes: nothing was provided for the untitled captains.<ref name = \"Fox 113-114\"> Fox 113-114</ref> \n\nThis seizure of goods was represented by Sandwich and Penn as a payment on account of their expected prize money, although it was in clear breach of the instructions issued in 1665 at the outbreak of the war that required ships and goods to be declared as lawful prizes by an Admiralty court before any goods in its hold could be removed. Marsden, (1911), pp. 44-45. Three of those officers offered 2,000 pounds of goods refused to take them, and the untitled captains complained against the arrangement. In the course of the removal of goods from the Dutch ships\u2019 holds, many English sailors joined in the plundering, and a large quantity of spices and other valuable goods were stolen or spoilt. The Earl of Sandwich lost his command, and the government lost goods and money that could have been used to send the fleet back to sea.<ref name = \"Fox 115\"> Fox 115</ref>\n\nEnglish privateers were very prominent at sea during the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]], attacking the maritime trade and fisheries on which the United Provinces depended, capturing many Dutch merchant ships. <ref name = \"Fox 69-70\"> Fox 69-70</ref> \n\n===[[War of the Spanish Succession]]===\nThe situation of ships\u2019 captains was remedied by a Prize Act of 1692. This act distinguished between captures made by privateers and by royal ships. Privateers were entitled to retain any ships captured and four-fifths of the goods, surrendering one-fifth of those to the Crown, and it was left to them how they sold their prizes and distributed the proceeds. However, in the case of captures by royal ships, one-third of their value went to the officers and men of the captor, and one third to the king, from which he could reward flag officers. The final one-third was to benefit those sick and wounded, as before, and for the first time was also used to pay dependents of crew members killed and to fund [[Greenwich Hospital]].<ref name = \"Wright 53\"> Wright 53</ref>\n\nThe 1692 act also abolished the ancient right of pillage, standardised gun money at 10 pounds a gun and provided for [[salvage]] to be paid by the owners of English ships recaptured from the enemy. <ref name = \"Marsden 90\"> Marsden (1915) 90</ref> Until 1692, the allocation of the one-third of the value of prize money due to the officers and men lad been a matter of custom, but it was then fixed as one-third (or one-ninth of the total prize money) to the captain, one-third to other officers and one-third to the crew.<ref name =\" Ehrman 129-130\"> Ehrman 129-130</ref>\n\nDuring this war, in 1701, the [[Admiralty]] had established a board of Prize Commissioners, who appointed local prize agents at British and some colonial ports, and were responsible for the custody of ships captured both by privateers and royal ships until these captures were either condemned or released. Although privateers were free to dispose of prize ships and goods after they were condemned and any duties were paid, the Prize Commissioners were responsible for the sale of ships and cargoes captured by royal ships, the valuation of ships or goods acquired for Royal Navy use, and the calculation and payment of prize money. As many naval actions in this war took place in the Mediterranean or Caribbean, some captains disposed of captured ships without bringing them before an Admiralty prize agent, often defrauding their own crews of all or part of their prize money entitlement. A Royal Proclamation of 1702 made captains that failed to act through prize agents liable to court martial and dismissal.<ref name = \"Bromley 449-450\"> Bromley 449-450</ref> If the Admiralty Court found that a seizure was unlawful, the ships and cargo was restored to its owner, and the captor would be responsible for any loss or costs arising.<ref name = \"Malcomson, 64-65\"> Malcomson, 64-65</ref>\n\n==[[Great Britain]], 1707 to 1801== \nAfter the [[Act of Union 1707]] between England and Scotland, the former English prize money rules applied to Great Britain. The War of the Spanish Succession continued until 1714. \n\nAn Act of 1708, generally known as the ''Cruisers and Convoys Act'' was designed to protect British maritime trade by allocating Royal Navy ships to protect [[Convoy|convoys]], by encouraging privateers to assist in protecting convoys and amending the prize rules to encourage naval ships to attack enemy warships, and both Royal Navy ships and privateers to attack enemy privateers and merchant ships.The two main changes to the made under this Act were the abolition of the Crown\u2019s shares in the value of merchant ships and their cargoes captured by naval vessels, and of goods captured by privateers, and the payment of ''Head money'' of 5 pounds for each crew member of a captured or sunk enemy warship, as far as these could be established, replacing gun money. As with other Prize Acts, this ceased to have effect at the end of the War of the Spanish Succession in 1714, although its provisions were largely repeated in subsequent Prize Acts of 1756, 1776, 1780 and 1793, issued at the outbreaks of conflicts or to include new belligerents.<ref name = \"Baugh 113-114\"> Baugh 113-114</ref><ref name = \"Wright 58\"> Wright 58</ref> Occasionally, if an enemy merchant ship were captured where it was difficult to take it to an Admiralty Court or prize agent, the captor might offer to ransom it for 10% to 15% of its estimated value.<ref name = \"Hill, 99\"> Hill, 99</ref>. In 1815, ransoming was prohibited except in case of necessity, for example where an enemy warship were nearby.<ref name = \"Malcomson, 68-69\"> Malcomson, 68-69</ref>   \n\nThe 1708 Act still required captured ships to be placed in the custody of Admiralty prize agents before adjudication by the Admiralty Court, and of paying [[Customs]] duties on captured cargoes. However, once they had paid these duties, Royal Navy captors were free to sell these cargoes at the best prices rather than having to sell them through Admiralty prize agents, as privateers had always been able to do so. The Act also allowed Royal Navy captains, officers and crews to appoint their own experts and prize agents to dispute the value of ships or goods acquired for naval use and collect prize money on their behalf.<ref name = \"Rodger, 128\u2013130\"> Rodger (1986) 128\u2013130</ref> Admiralty appointed prize agents were, however, now entitled to a fee of 2% in Britain and 5% abroad. The various changes brought in by this Act are regarded as the basis for the fortunes made from prize money in the 18th and early 19th centuries.\n<ref name = \"Bromley 451-452\"> Bromley 451-452</ref>.\n\n===Distribution===\nIn the Georgian navy, shares of prize money were based on rank. As there were few senior of\ufb01cers, their individual shares were larger than junior officers and very much larger than those of the seamen. The percentages of prize money granted to senior of\ufb01cers were generally higher in the 18th century than in most of the 19th century. Although shares varied over time, and captains within a \ufb02eet or squadron could agree alternative sharing arrangements, in the 18th century, an admiral could generally receive one-eighth of the value of all prizes taken by his fleet or squadron, and if there were more than one admiral, they would share that eighth. A captain usually received one-quarter of the value his prize, or three-eighths if not under the command of an admiral. The distribution for other officers and men was less detailed than it later became: other other of\ufb01cer shared another quarter and the crew shared the remainder. Any ships within sight of a battle also participated in the sharing of prize money, and any unclaimed prize money was allocated to [[Greenwich Hospital, London| Greenwich Hospital]].<ref name = \"Allen, 213\"> Allen, 213</ref>  \n\nDuring the [[Seven Years' War]], the crews of privateers operating from the British colonies in America and the Caribbean were often paid wages as well as a share of prize money, but the crews of those operating from British ports usually received no wages and the cost the provisions they consumed was deducted from their prize money. The owners of privateers generally took half the value of any prize and also charged a further 10% to cover prize agents' fees and other commissions. The captain received 8% of the value by custom, leaving 32% to be shared by the other officers and crew. It was common practice to divide this into shares, with the officers receiving several times as much as seamen, their relative shares being agreed at the start of the voyage.<ref name = \"Rodger, 97, 312\"> Rodger (1986) 97, 312</ref>\n\n===Notable awards, 1707 to 1801=== \nPerhaps the greatest amount of prize money awarded for the capture of a single ship was for that of the [[Spanish frigate Hermione|Spanish frigate ''Hermione'']] on 31 May 1762 by the British frigate {{HMS|Active|1758|2}} and sloop {{HMS|Favourite|1757|2}}. The two captains, [[Herbert Sawyer (1730\u20131798)|Herbert Sawyer]] and [[Philemon Pownoll]], received about \u00a365,000 apiece, while each seaman and Marine got \u00a3482 to 485.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hillsdalesites.org/personal/hstewart/war/Navy3/1762-Hermione.htm |title=Capture of The Hermione |accessdate=2008-08-04 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422014607/http://www.hillsdalesites.org/personal/hstewart/war/Navy3/1762-Hermione.htm |archivedate=April 22, 2009 }} </ref><ref name=hms>{{cite web |url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxoaXN0b3JpY2FsbWFyaXRpbWVzb2NpZXR5fGd4OjQ3NzRiYTAyMmRjNjFiOGM |title=Nelson and His Navy \u2013 Prize Money |publisher=The Historical Maritime Society |accessdate=2008-08-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23496 |title=How Britannia Came to Rule the Waves |author=W.

The [[Treaty of Amiens]] of March 1802 ended the hostilities of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and those of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] commenced in May 1803, when the United Kingdom declared war in France.\n \nPrize Acts at the start of war with France and Spain repeated the provisions of the 1793 Act, which in turn largely repeated those of 1708.<ref name = \"Wright 59\"> Wright 59</ref> The basis of distribution under these acts is detailed in the next section. However, a proclamation of 1812 soon after the start of the [[War of 1812]] made a further revision to the rules on allocation, such that the admiral and captain jointly received one-quarter of the prize money with one-third of this going to the admiral, a reduction from their previous entitlement. The Master and lieutenants received one-eighth of the prize money, as did the warrant officers. The crew below warrant officer rank now shared one-half of the prize money. However, this group was subdivided into several grades, from senior petty officers down to boys, with the higher grades gaining at the expense of the lower ones. <ref name = \"Hill, 204-205\"> Hill, 204-205</ref> The Prize Act of 1815, issued after [[Napoleon]]\u2019s return from Elba, largely repeated the allocation below the flag officers\u2019 share into eight grades and, although it lapsed in the same year, its provisions were re-enacted in 1854 at the start of the [[Crimean War]].<ref name = \"Wright 60-61\"> Wright 60-61</ref>\n\nThe multiplicity of prize money grades survived until 1918, with some refinements to include new ratings required for steamships. The Naval Agency and Distribution Act of 1864 was a permanent Act, rather than one enacted at the start of a particular conflict, stating that prize money was to be distributed according to a [[Royal Proclamation]] or [[Order in Council]] issued when appropriate.<ref name = \" Lushington 106-107, 109-111\"> Lushington, 106-107</ref> This act made no provision for privateers as the United Kingdom had signed the [[Paris Declaration Respecting Maritime Law| Declaration of Paris]], which outlawed privateering by the ships of signatory nations.<ref name = \"Parillo 62-63\"> Parillo (2007), 62-63</ref> The [[Royal Proclamation]] on the division of prize money dated 19 May 1866 provided for a single admiral to receive, or several admiral to share, one-thirtieth of the prize money pool; a single captain or commanding officer to receive, or several share, one-tenth of the pool, and the residue to be allocated to officers and ratings in 10 classes in specified shares.<ref name = \" Lushington 109-111\"> Lushington, 109-111</ref>\n\nThe Prize Courts Acts of 1894 provided that regulations for setting up of Prize Courts and on prize money should in future be initiated at the start of any war only by an [[Order in Council]] and not by Royal Proclamation. The Naval Prize Act 1918 changed the system to one where the prize money was no longer paid to the crews of individual ships, but into a common fund from which a payment was made to all naval personnel. The Act also stated that no distribution until after the end of the war. The award of prize money in the two World Wars were governed by this legislation, which was further modified in 1945 to allow for the distribution to be made to [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) personnel who had been involved in the capture of enemy ships. The Prize Act, 1948 abolished the Crown prerogative of granting prize money or any money arising from Droits of the Crown in wartime. <ref name = \" O\u2019Hare 116-117\"> O\u2019Hare 116-117</ref>\n\nFor more on the Prize Court during [[World War I]], ''see also'' [[Maxwell Hendry Maxwell-Anderson]].\n\n===Anti-slavery===\nAfter the British abolition of the slave trade in 1807, an additional source of prize money arose when Royal Navy ships of the [[West Africa Squadron]] captured slave ships. Under an Order in Council of 1808, the government paid 60 [[Pound sterling| pounds]] for each male slave freed, 30 pounds for each woman and 10 pounds for each child aged under 14. This was paid in lieu of any prize money for the captured slave ship, which became the property of the British government, and it was allocated in the same proportions as other prize money. Between 1807 and 1811, 1,991 slaves were freed through the Vice-Admiralty Court of [[Sierra Leone]], and between 1807 and mid-1815, [[HM Treasury]] paid Royal Navy personnel 191,100 pounds in prize money for slaves freed in West Africa. Condemned slave ships were usually auctioned at Freetown and re-registered as British ships.<ref name = \"Allen, 213\"> Allen, 213</ref><ref name = \"Helfman, 1143-1144\"> Helfman, 1143-1144</ref> However, in 1825, the bounty for all slaves was reduced to a flat rate of 10 pounds, and it was further reduced to 5 pounds for each live slave in 1830. The decline in captures prompted an increase in prize money in 1839 to 5 pounds for each slave landed alive, half that sum for slaves that had died and one pound and ten [[Shilling (British coin)| shillings]] for each ton of the captured vessel\u2019s [[tonnage]].<ref name = \"Lloyd, 79-81\"> Lloyd 79-81</ref>. \n\n===Distribution===\n[[File:Warrantchart.png|thumb|Command structure of a Navy ship c. 1810, showing prize money groupings]]\nThe following scheme for distribution of prize money was used for much of the [[Napoleonic wars]] until 1812, the heyday of prize warfare. Allocation was by eighths. Two eighths of the prize money went to the [[Captain (naval)|captain]] or commander, generally propelling him upwards in political and financial circles. One eighth of the money went to the [[admiral]] or commander-in-chief who signed the ship's written orders (unless the orders came directly from the [[Admiralty]] in London, in which case this eighth also went to the captain). One eighth was divided among the [[lieutenant]]s, [[sailing master]], and [[Captain (land)|captain of marines]], if any. One eighth was divided among the  wardroom warrant officers ([[Ship's doctor|surgeon]], [[purser]], and [[chaplain]]), standing warrant officers ([[carpenter]], [[boatswain]], and [[Gunner (rank)|gunner]]), [[lieutenant|lieutenant of marines]], and the [[master's mate]]s.  One eighth was divided among the junior warrant and petty officers, their mates, sergeants of marines, [[captain's clerk]], [[surgeon's mate]]s, and [[midshipman|midshipmen]]. The final two eighths were divided among the crew, with able and specialist seamen receiving larger shares than ordinary seamen, landsmen, and boys.<ref name=\"lavery135136\">*{{cite book|last=Lavery|first=Brian|title=Nelson's Navy: The Ships, Men and Organization|year=1989|location=Annapolis, MD |publisher=Naval Institute Press|isbn=0-87021-258-3|oclc=20997619|url=https://archive.org/details/nelsonsnavyships00lave|url-access=registration|quote=Nelson's Navy Lavery.|accessdate=2009-05-19|pages=[https://archive.org/details/nelsonsnavyships00lave/page/135 135]\u2013136}}</ref><ref name = \"Rodger, 522\u2013524\">Rodger (205) 522\u2013524</ref> The pool for the seamen was divided into shares, with each able seaman getting two shares in the pool (referred to as a fifth-class share), an ordinary seaman received a share and a half (referred to as a sixth-class share), landsmen received a share each (a seventh-class share), and boys received a half share each (referred to as an eighth-class share).\n\nA notable prize award related to a capture in January 1807, when the frigate ''Caroline'' took the Spanish ship ''San Rafael'' as a prize, netting Captain Peter Rainier \u00a352,000.<ref name=hms />\n\n===Operational difficulties===\nFor much of the 18th century and until 1815, the main complaints about prize money concerned delays in its payment and practices that deprived ordinary seamen of much of what was due to them. Although the incidence of captains selling captured ships abroad and defrauding crews of prize money reduced greatly in the course of the century, payment was often by way of a promissory note, or ''ticket'' to be paid when the relevant naval department had funds. Although officers could generally afford to wait for payment, which was often made only in London and sometimes in instalments that might stretch over several years, most seamen sold their promissory notes at a large discount.<ref name = \"Bromley 474-476\"> Bromley 474-476</ref> Other seamen authorised another individual to collect their prize money, who did not always passed it on, or lost out when they transferred to a new ship, if their prize money were not forwarded. A final issue of contention was that the value of prizes assessed in overseas Vice-Admiralty courts could be reassessed in the Admiralty Court in Britain if the Admiralty appealed the initial valuation. Excessive valuations in Vice-Admiralty courts, particularly in the West Indies, arose because the courts charged fees based on the prizes' values.<ref name = \"Rodger, 317-318\"> Rodger (1986) 317-318</ref>This led to delays and possible reduced payments.<ref name = \"Malcomson, 65-66\"> Malcomson, 65-66</ref> \n\nTo some extent, delays arose from the time taken by Vice-Admiralty courts adjudicating whether captured ships were legitimate prizes and, if they were, their value. In the [[War of 1812]], the Vice-Admiralty courts at [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] and, to a lesser extent, [[Bermuda]] had to deal with many, often small, American ships captured both by privateers and naval vessels, leading to lengthy legal delays in adjudication. Once an adjudication was made, providing there was no appeal, the funds from the sale of a captured ship or its goods should have been available for payment within two years, but the whole process from capture to payment might take three years or more. <ref name = \"Malcomson, 63-64\"> Malcomson, 63-64</ref> \n\nUnder the so-called ''joint capture''rules, which did not apply to privateers, any Royal Navy ship present when a capture took place was entitled to share in the prize money. However, this rule led to disputes where, for example, three claimant ships had been pursuing the captured ship but were out of sight when another captured it, or where a squadron commander claimed a share in a prize captured by his subordinate in disobedience to that commander\u2019s orders. In order to minimise disputes, some captains and crews of ships on the same mission made time-limited agreements to share prize money.<ref name = \"Malcomson, 64-65\"> Malcomson, 64-65</ref> In the case of privateers, for one to claim a share of prize money, it had to give actual assistance to the ship making the capture unless there were a prior agreement between privateers to share prizes.<ref name = \"Van Niekerk, 119\"> Van Niekerk 119</ref>\n\n==Scotland and Ireland==\n\n===Scotland=== \nThe [[Kingdom of Scotland]] had its own [[Lord High Admiral of Scotland| Lord High Admiral]] from mediaeval times until 1707, except for the period 1652 to 1661. His jurisdiction over Scottish ships, waters and coasts, exercised through a High Court of Admiralty, was similar to that of his English equivalent.<ref name = \"Murdoch, 10, 237\"> Murdoch 10 237</ref> In 1652, the [[Royal Scots Navy| Scottish fleet]] that was absorbed into the Commonwealth fleet and, although a separate Scottish Admiralty was re-established in 1661, it had no warships designed as such until three relatively small ones were commissioned in 1696.<ref name = \"Murdoch, 230, 236\"> Murdoch 230 236</ref>\n\nHowever, as Scotland was involved in the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War|Second]] (1665\u201367) and [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]]s (1672\u201374) against the Dutch and their allies, the Scottish Admiralty commissioned a significant number of privateers after 1665 by issuing  [[Letters of marque]]. <ref name = \"Murdoch, 27, 238-240\"> Murdoch 27, 238-240</ref> At least 80 privateers operating from Scottish ports in these two wars have been identified, and contemporaries estimated as many as 120 may have operated against Dutch and Danish merchant ships, including some English ships operating under Scottish commissions.<ref name = \"Murdoch, 240-241\"> Murdoch 240-241</ref> Apart from ships of the [[Dutch East India Company]], many Dutch merchant ships and of its Danish ally were poorly armed and undermanned.

During the 17th and 18th centuries, the each of these was responsible for  providing warships to the navy of the [[Dutch Republic]] and acting as prize courts for captures by both for their own warships and for privateers to whom they had given commissions, although these were formally issued in the name of the States General.<ref name = \" Bruijn, 5\"> Bruijn(2011) 5</ref> From the 1620s, the States General also delegated authority to the [[Dutch East India Company]] and the [[Dutch West India Company]] to issue Letters of marque valid within each company\u2019s area of operation. Lunsford, (2005), pp. 118, 182. In the 17th century, the greatest number of privateers operated under the jurisdiction of the [[Admiralty of Zeeland]], and its councillors based in [[Middelburg]] spent a great deal of time dealing with the complex business of adjudicating prizes. Prizes were normally sold by auction, and the large numbers captured in the 17th century wars against Spain, England and France depressed prices and restricted the prize money crews received.<ref name = \" Bruijn, 8\"> Bruijn(2011) 8</ref>\n\nAlthough prize money was an important supplement to the income of the officers of Dutch warships, there has been little research on how the five admiralties calculated the amounts of prize money distributed to the officers and men capturing prizes. The [[Lieutenant-Admiral]] of an admiralty generally received four times as much as the captain responsible for a capture, and the [[Vice-Admiral]] twice as much: in both cases, these flag-officers shared in all ships and goods taken by captains in their admiralties, even when not present at the capture.<ref name = \" Bruijn, 44, 104\"> Bruijn(2011) 44, 104</ref> In 1640, [[Maarten Tromp]], a Lieutenant-Admiral was owed 13,800 [[guilders]], mostly his share of prize money from the [[Battle of the Downs]] the previous year. \n\nBoth captains and flag officers in the Dutch fleet sometimes put the pursuit of prize money before discipline. In the [[Four Days' Battle]] of June 1666, several Dutch ships left the fleet either towing English ships they had captured or in pursuit of prizes, <ref name = \"Fox 212, 218\"> Fox 212, 218</ref> and [[Cornelis Tromp]] was extremely reluctant to burn {{HMS|Prince Royal|1610|6}} after it had run aground and been damaged, despite the orders of his commander, [[Michiel de Ruyter]]. Tromp attempted to claim compensation for its loss for many years. <ref name = \"Fox 240\"> Fox 240</ref> For ordinary seamen, prize money was rare, the amounts small and payment was often delayed.<ref name = \" Bruijn, 46\"> Bruijn(2011) 46</ref> In many cases, prize money was paid in installments over several years and crew members frequently sold advance notes for the later instalments at far below their face value, especially in the 18th century, when several of the Admiralties were in financial difficulties.<ref name = \" Bruijn, 119-120\"> Bruijn(2011) 119-120</ref> \n\nPrivateering was already established when the Dutch Republic broke away from Spain: it quickly developed in the late 16th century and expended further in the 17th century.<ref name = \"Lunsford, 118, 182\"> Lunsford 118, 182</ref>. In many cases, Dutch privateers attempted to evade the prize rules, by attacking neutral or even Dutch ships, failing to bring captures or their cargoes for adjudication and removing and selling cargoes to avoid paying duties.<ref name = \"Lunsford, 155-156\"> Lunsford, 155-156</ref> Privateers licenced by the two Dutch India companies were aggressive in attacking what they termed ''interlopers'' in their areas of operations, regardless of nationality, and both companies were active in privateering in the three Anglo-Dutch wars. .<ref name = \"Lunsford, 183-184\"> Lunsford 183-184</ref> \n\nDuring the [[Eighty Years' War]], the main targets of Dutch privateers were Spanish and Portuguese ships, including those of the [[Spanish Netherlands]]. Privateers licenced by the West India Company were very active against ships trading with Brazil. <ref name = \"Klooster, 43-44\"> Klooster 43-44</ref> The privateers that had attacked Portuguese shipping had to cease doing so after the 1661 [[Treaty of The Hague]], but many quickly transferred their activities to attacking English shipping after 1665 during the Second and Third Anglo-Dutch wars. <ref name = \"Bruijn, 145\"> Bruijn (2011) 145</ref>. However, there was relatively little Dutch privateering after the end of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], a consequence of the general decline in Dutch maritime activity. <ref name = \"Bruijn, 56\"> Bruijn (2008) 56</ref>\n\n==United States==\n===To 1814===\nDuring the Revolutionary War period, the [[Continental Congress]] had no navy and relied heavily on privateers who had been authorised by one of the states to capture British ships. Admiralty Courts for the state that had authorised the privateer adjudicated on the ownership of captured vessels and their value. <ref name = \"Mask & Mac Mahon, 477, 480\"> Mask & Mac Mahon 477, 480</ref> The [[Continental Navy]], formed in 1775 was small and outmatched by the Royal Navy, whereas American privateers captured about 600 British merchant ships in the course of this conflict. <ref name = \"Mask & Mac Mahon, 487\"> Mask & Mac Mahon 487</ref>  In 1787, the US Constitution transferred the right to grant [[Letters of Marque]] from the states to Congress. <ref name = \"Parrillo, 3\"> Parrillo (2007) 3</ref>  \n\nAt the start of the [[War of 1812]], the few larger US Navy ships were laid-up, while the Royal Navy had relatively few resources available in the western Atlantic, leaning the field free for privateers on both sides.<ref name = \"Kert, 7-8\"> Kert 7-8</ref> However, once the US Navy frigates were brought back into commission, they achieved some spectacular successes against weaker British frigates, with [[Stephen Decatur]] and [[John Rodgers (1772-1838)| John Rodgers]] both receiving over 10,000 dollars in prize money.<ref name = \"Kert, 114\"> Kert 114</ref> However, later in the war, the Royal Navy succeeded in blockading the US [[Eastern seaboard]] and capturing several US Navy vessels and a number of merchant ships, and also stifling American privateer activity, although single US Navy warships managed to avoid the blockade and attack British shipping in the [[Caribbean]] and off South America.<ref name = \"Kert, 115-116\"> Kert 116-116</ref> \n\nFrom the inception of its navy, the United States government granted naval personnel additional payments of two kinds, prize money, being a share in the proceeds from captured enemy merchant vessels and their cargo, and head money, a cash reward from the US Treasury for sinking enemy warships. From 1791, US Navy personnel received half the proceeds of a prize of equal or inferior force, and all the proceeds of a vessel of superior force. Privateers, in contrast, received all the proceeds of any prize, but had to pay duties that rose to 40% during the War of 1812, although they were lower at other times. Generally, half of the net amount went to the owners of the privateer, half to the crew.<ref name = \"Parillo 24\"> Parillo (2007), 24</ref> From 1800, US Navy ships that sunk an armed enemy ship received a bounty of twenty dollars for each enemy crew member at the start of the action, divided among the crew of that ship in the same proportions as other prize money.<ref name = \"Parillo 25\"> Parillo (2007), 25</ref>\n\n===Distribution===\nUnder United States legislation of 1800, whether the officers and men of the navy ship or ships responsible for the capturing a prize were entitled to half of the assessed value of the prize, or the whole value in the case of a capture of superior force, the prize money fund was to be allocated in specified proportions. The captain or captains of vessels taking prizes were entitled to 10% of the prize money fund, and the commander of the squadron to 5% of the fund. In the event that the captain was operating independently, he received 15% of the prize fund. Naval lieutenants, captains of marines and sailing Masters were to share 10%, increased to approximately 12% if there were no lieutenants of marines. Chaplains, lieutenants of marines, surgeons, pursers, boatswains, gunners, carpenters, and master\u2019s mates shared 10% of the prize fund, reduced to approximately 8% if there were no lieutenants of marines. Midshipman, junior warrant offices and the mates of senior warrant officers shared 17.5% and a range of petty officers a further 12.5%. This left 35% for the rest of the crew. Any unclaimed prize money was to be retained jointly by the Navy and Treasury secretaries to fund disability pensions and [[half-pay]].<ref name = \"Peters, 47-48, Articles V, VI, IX and X\"> Peters 47-48, Articles V, VI, IX and X</ref> \n \n===From 1815===\nFor most of the period between the end of the War of 1812 and the start of the [[American Civil War]], there was little opportunity to gain prize money. After the outbreak of the Civil War, the [[Confederate States of America| Confederate States]] granted some 30 commissions or Letters of marque to privateers, which captured between 50 and 60 United States merchant ships. However, a declaration by [[Abraham Lincoln]] that [[Confederate privateer]]s would be treated as pirates and the closure of the ports of European colonies in the Caribbean as venues for the disposal of prize vessels and cargoes encoraged their owners to turn to [[Blockade runner| Blockade running]].<ref name = \"Peifer, 98-99\"> Peifer 98-99</ref> \n\nFrom 1861, US Navy ships engaged Confederate privateers and [[Blockade runner]]s: as the 1800 legislation only applied to enemies of the United States, which did not recognise the Confederate States, it was unclear if prize money would apply. However, a revised statute of 1864 stated that \"the provisions of this title shall apply to all captures made as prize by authority of the United States\", allowing prize money claims to be made.<ref name = \"Library of Congress, 315, Section 33\"> Library of Congress, 315, Section 33</ref> Over 11 million dollars of prize money was paid to US Navy personnel for captures in the [[American Civil War| Civil War]] period. It has been calculated that about one-third of prize money due was payable to officers under the prevailing rules, but that approximately half of the money actually paid went to officers, most probably because of the difficulty in tracing enlisted men when payments were delayed.<ref name = \"Parillo 66\"> Parillo (2013), 66</ref>\n\nIn 1856, the [[Paris Declaration Respecting Maritime Law| Declaration of Paris]] was signed: this outlawed privateering by the ships of the 55 nations that signed it. However, the United States did not Spain sign the declaration, in part because it considered that, if privateering were to be abolished, the capture of merchant ships by naval vessels should also cease. Despite this, the United States agreed to respect the declaration during the [[American Civil War]], although [[Abraham Lincoln| Lincoln's]] cabinet did discuss the use of privateers against British merchant shipping in the event Britain recognised the Confederacy.<ref name = \"Parillo 63\"> Parillo (2007) 63</ref> \n\nA number of changes were made to the allocation of prize money to US Navy personnel in the 19th century in the last being in 1864. This preserved the awards 5% of the prize fund to commanders of the squadron, which now also applied to fleet commanders of fleet and of 10% to captains under the immediate command of a flag officer or 15% for those operating independently. It added new awards of 2% for a commander of a division of a fleet under the orders of a fleet commander and 1% for a [[Captain of the fleet| fleet captain]] stationed on the flagship. The most significant change was that the residue of prize money after making these awards was to be divided amongst the remaining officers and men in proportion to their rates of pay. This law also increased the bounty or head money for destroying an enemy warship in action, or any other enemy ship that it was necessary to destroy was increased to 100 dollars for each enemy crew member at the start of the action on a ship of less or equal force, or 200 dollars for each crew member of an enemy ship of greater force, to be divided among the officers and men of the US ship in the same proportions as other prize money.<ref name = \"Library of Congress, 309-301, Sections 10 & 11\"> Library of Congress, 309-301, Sections 10 & 11</ref>\n\nThe small size of US Navy meant that privateering would be the main way it could attack enemy commerce. In the Civil War, Lincoln's cabinet had discussed the use of privateers against British merchant shipping in the event Britain recognised the Confederacy, Until the early 1880s, American naval opinion considered that privateering remained a viable option, although subsequent increases in the size of the US Navy changed this view.<ref name = \"Parillo 4, 10-11\"> Parillo (2007) 4 10-11</ref> \n\nIn the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] of 1898, neither the United States nor Spain issued commissions to privateers. However, the US Navy was granted what were to be last payments of prize money made by the US Treasury for that war. These were to sailors that took part in the battles of [[Battle of Manila Bay| Manila Bay]] and [[Battle of Santiago de Cuba| Santiago]] and divided prize funds of 244,400 dollars and 166,700 dollars respectively, based on the estimated numbers of Spanish sailors and the value of ships salvaged at Manilla.<ref name = \"Knauth, 70, 73\"> Knauth 70, 73</ref>\n\n===Abolition===\nDuring the Spanish American War in 1898, the US Navy was seen by much of the United States population as seeking to profit from prize money and head money to an unacceptable extent, even though the amounts of granted were relatively modest. All awards of prize money and head money to US Navy personnel were abolished by an overwhelming vote of Congress in March 1899, shortly after the Spanish-American War conclded.<ref name = \"Parillo, 47, 308-309\"> Parillo (2013) 47, 308-309</ref> \n\nIt is sometimes claimed that the US Navy last paid prize money in 1947.<ref>Nofi, Al (20 July 2008).

Although the Odenwald was not a warship, it was sailing under the United States flag and claiming to be registered there, and also carrying contraband, either of which rendered the ship liable to arrest although not condemnation as a prize. After the Odenwald was stopped, its crew tried to scuttle it and took to the lifeboats. However, a boarding party from the Omaha managed to prevent the Odenwald from sinking and sailed it first to [[Trinidad]], then to [[Puerto Rico]]. The United States was not at war with Germany at the time, and after the war, the Odenwald\u2019s owners claimed that its seizure was therefore illegal. The Admiralty Court in Puerto Rico, however, ruled in 1947 that the crew\u2019s attempt to scuttle the ship, and then abandon, it meant that the Omaha\u2019s boarding party and salvage party that jointly brought the Odenwald to port had salvage rights, worth approximately 3 million dollars. It also ruled explicitly that it was not a case of bounty or prize.<ref> Justia US Law.

However, between 1775 and 1815, revenues declined sharply, largely because the probability of seizing a prize ship fell dramatically, partly owing to the increasing numbers of naval vessels competing for captures. As outfitting and manning ships for commerce raiding was expensive, privateering became less financially attractive.<ref name = \"Hillmann & Gathmann, 732, 740, 746-748\"> Hillmann & Gathmann 732, 740, 746-748</ref> \n\nThe Declaration of Paris 1856, by outlawing privateering by ships of signatory nations, would have made it politically difficult for non-signatories, which included the United States to commission privateers in a future conflict,<ref name = \"Parillo 63\"> Parillo (2007) 63</ref> and the privateering using metal-hulled steamships presented the additional problems of maintaining complex engines, the need for frequent re-coaling and to repair more complex damage than that experienced by wooden-hulled sailing ships. In addition, after 1880, many maritime countries paid subsidies so that liners and other fast merchant vessels were built with a view to conversion into [[Armed merchantmen | Armed Merchant Cruisers]] under naval control in wartime, which replaced the need for privateers, and no privateers were commissioned after the American Civil War.<ref name = \"Coogan, 22\"> Coogan 22</ref><ref name = \"Parillo, 76-78\"> Parillo (2007) 76-78</ref> \n  \n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n* {{cite journal| first1= J.C.|last1= Appleby |first2=M. |last2=O'Dowd| title = The Irish Admiralty: Its Organisation and Development, c. 1570-1640| journal= Irish Historical Studies| year = 1985| volume=24|issue=96| pages=299-326}}\n* {{cite journal|first= D.

It is set in the turbulent years towards the [[End of the Han dynasty|end]] of the [[Han dynasty]] and the [[Three kingdoms (China)|Three Kingdoms]] period in [[History of China|Chinese history]], starting in 169 AD and ending with the reunification of the land in 280.\n\nThe story \u2013 part historical, part legend, and part mythical \u2013 romanticises and dramatises the lives of feudal lords and their retainers, who tried to replace the dwindling Han dynasty or restore it. While the novel follows hundreds of characters, the focus is mainly on the three power blocs that emerged from the remnants of the Han dynasty, and would eventually form the three states of [[Cao Wei]], [[Shu Han]], and [[Eastern Wu]]. The novel deals with the plots, personal and military battles, intrigues, and struggles of these states to achieve dominance for almost 100 years.\n\n''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'' is acclaimed as one of the [[Classic Chinese Novels|Four Great Classical Novels]] of [[Chinese literature]]; it has a total of 800,000 words and nearly a thousand dramatic characters (mostly historical) in 120 chapters.<ref name=\"roberts940\">Roberts 1991, pg. 940</ref> The novel is among the most beloved works of literature in [[East Asia]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2892148|title=(Review) Historical China film lives up to expectations|last=Kim|first=Hyung-eun|website=Korea JoongAng Daily|date=11 July 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111225000000/http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2892148|archivedate=25 December 2011|quote=The ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'' is comparable to the Bible in East Asia.

Plaks also states, \"By [[Sung dynasty|Sung times]] several contemporary accounts inform us that there existed professional [[Oral storytelling|oral storytellers]] who specialized in the Three Kingdoms hero cycles.\"  The earliest written work to combine these stories was a [[Pinghua (storytelling)|pinghua]], ''Sanguozhi Pinghua'' ({{zh|t=\u4e09\u570b\u5fd7\u5e73\u8a71|s=\u4e09\u56fd\u5fd7\u5e73\u8bdd|p=S\u0101ngu\u00f3zh\u00ec P\u00ednghu\u00e0|l=Story of ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]''}}), published sometime between 1321 and 1323.<ref name=\"Plaks\">{{cite book |last1=Plaks |first1=Andrew |title=The Four Masterworks of the Ming Novel: Ssu ta ch'i-shu |date=1987 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton |isbn=9780691628202 |pages=368\u2013369}}</ref>\n\n===Expansion of the history===\n''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'' is traditionally attributed to [[Luo Guanzhong]],<ref name=\"taylor1998\">{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Literary Translation into English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C1uXah12nHgC&pg=PA1221|accessdate=2011-09-22|year=1998|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=1-884964-36-2|pages=1221\u20131222}}</ref> a playwright who lived sometime between 1315 and 1400 (late Yuan to early Ming period) known for compiling historical plays in styles which were prevalent during the Yuan period.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book| title = Romance of the Three Kingdoms| last = Lo| first = Kuan-chung| authorlink =Luo Guanzhong| publisher = Tuttle| others = C.H.

The text may well have circulated before either date in handwritten manuscripts.<ref>Moss Roberts, \"Afterword,\" in Luo, ''Three Kingdoms'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1991), pp. 938, 964.</ref>\n\nIn any case, whether an earlier or later date of composition, whether or not Luo Guanzhong was responsible, the author made use of available historical records, including the ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'' compiled by [[Chen Shou]], which covered events from the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] in 184 to the unification of the Three Kingdoms under the [[Jin dynasty (265-420)|Jin dynasty]] in 280. The novel also includes material from [[Tang dynasty]] poetic works, Yuan dynasty operas and his own personal interpretation of elements such as virtue and legitimacy. The author combined this historical knowledge with a gift for storytelling to create a rich tapestry of personalities.<ref>Roberts, pp. 946\u201353.</ref>\n\n===Recensions and standardised text===\nSeveral versions of the expanded ''Sanguozhi'' are extant today. Luo Guanzhong's version in 24 volumes, known as the ''Sanguozhi Tongsu Yanyi'', is now held in the [[Shanghai Library]] in China, [[Tenri Central Library]] in Japan, and several other major libraries. Various 10-volume, 12-volume and 20-volume recensions of Luo's text, made between 1522 and 1690, are also held at libraries around the world. However, the standard text familiar to general readers is a [[recension]] by Mao Lun and his son [[Mao Zonggang]].\n\nIn the 1660s, during the reign of the [[Kangxi Emperor]] in the [[Qing dynasty]], Mao Lun and Mao Zonggang significantly edited the text, fitting it into 120 chapters, and abbreviating the title to ''Sanguozhi Yanyi''.<ref name=\"roberts980\" /> The text was reduced from 900,000 to 750,000 characters; significant editing was done for narrative flow; use of third-party poems was reduced and shifted from conventional verse to finer pieces; and most passages praising [[Cao Cao]]'s advisers and generals were removed.<ref name=\"roberts965\">Roberts 1991, pg. 965</ref> Scholars have long debated whether the Maos' viewpoint was anti-Qing (identifying Southern Ming remnants with Shu-Han) or pro-Qing.<ref name=\"roberts967 71\">Roberts 1991, pp. 967\u2013971</ref>\n\nThe famous opening lines of the novel, \"[[Tianxia|The empire]], long divided, must unite; long united, must divide.

In addition, Mao also added [[Yang Shen]]'s ''[http://www.vincentpoon.com/the-immortals-by-the-river-----------------.html The Immortals by the River]'' as the famous introductory poem (which began with \"The gushing waters of the Yangzi River pour and disappear into the East\") (\u6eda\u6eda\u957f\u6c5f\u4e1c\u901d\u6c34) to the novel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vincentpoon.com/the-immortals-by-the-river-----------------.html|title=The Immortals by the River (\u694a\u614e \u81e8\u6c5f\u4ed9) \u6eda\u6eda\u957f\u6c5f\u4e1c\u901d\u6c34|website=Vincent's Calligraphy|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-08-02}}</ref> The earlier editions, moreover, spend less time on the process of division, which they found painful, and far more time on the process of reunification and the struggles of the heroes who sacrificed for it.<ref>Bojun Shen, translated by Kimberly Basio, \"Studies of Three Kingdoms in the New Century,\" in Besio and Tong, eds., ''Three Kingdoms and Chinese Culture'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=yhogHgTrzyEC&q=The+empire+long+divided+must+unite#v=snippet&q=The%20empire%20long%20divided%20must%20unite&f=false p. 154]</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nOne of the greatest achievements of ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'' is the extreme complexity of its stories and characters. The novel contains numerous subplots. The following consists of a summary of the central plot and some well-known highlights in the novel.\n\n[[File:Three Brothers (Bei, Yu, Fei).jpg|thumb|200px|''Three Heroes of Three Kingdoms'', silk painting by Sekkan Sakurai (1715\u20131790), depicting Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei.]]\n\n===Yellow Turban Rebellion and the Ten Attendants===\nIn the [[End of the Han dynasty|final years]] of the [[Eastern Han dynasty]], treacherous [[eunuch]]s and villainous officials deceived the emperor and persecuted good officials. The government gradually became extremely corrupt on all levels, leading to widespread deterioration of the Han Empire. During the reign of [[Emperor Ling of Han|Emperor Ling]], the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] broke out under the leadership of [[Zhang Jue|Zhang Jiao]].\n\nThe rebellion was barely suppressed by imperial forces led by the general [[He Jin]]. Upon Emperor Ling's death, He Jin installed the young [[Liu Bian|Emperor Shao]] on the throne and took control of the central government. The [[Ten Attendants]], a group of influential court eunuchs, feared that He Jin was growing too powerful, so they lured him into the palace and assassinated him. In revenge, He Jin's supporters broke into the palace and indiscriminately slaughtered any person who looked like a eunuch. In the ensuing chaos, Emperor Shao and his younger half-brother, the [[Emperor Xian of Han|Prince of Chenliu]], disappeared from the palace.\n\n===Dong Zhuo's tyranny===\nThe missing emperor and the prince were found by soldiers of the warlord [[Dong Zhuo]], who seized control of the imperial capital, [[Luoyang]], under the pretext of protecting the emperor. Dong Zhuo later deposed Emperor Shao and replaced him with the Prince of Chenliu ([[Emperor Xian of Han|Emperor Xian]]), who was merely a figurehead under his control. Dong Zhuo monopolised state power, persecuted his political opponents and oppressed the common people for his personal gain. There were two attempts on his life: the first was by a military officer, Wu Fu (\u4f0d\u5b5a), who failed and died a gruesome death; the second was by [[Cao Cao]], whose attempt went awry and forced him to flee.\n\nCao Cao escaped from Luoyang, returned to his hometown and sent out a fake imperial edict to various regional officials and warlords, calling them to rise up against Dong Zhuo. Under [[Yuan Shao]]'s leadership, 18 warlords formed a coalition army and launched a punitive [[campaign against Dong Zhuo]]. Dong Zhuo felt threatened after losing the battles of [[Battle of Sishui Pass|Sishui Pass]] and [[Battle of Hulao Pass|Hulao Pass]], so he evacuated Luoyang and moved the imperial capital to [[Chang'an]]. He forced Luoyang's residents to move together with him and had the city set aflame. The coalition eventually broke up due to poor leadership and conflicting interests among its members. Meanwhile, in Chang'an, Dong Zhuo was betrayed and murdered by his foster son [[L\u00fc Bu]] in a dispute over the maiden [[Diaochan]] as part of a plot orchestrated by the minister [[Wang Yun (Han dynasty)|Wang Yun]].\n\n===Conflict among the various warlords and nobles===\nIn the meantime, the Han Empire was already disintegrating into civil war as warlords fought for territories and power. [[Sun Jian]] found the [[Imperial Seal of China|Imperial Seal]] in the ruins of Luoyang and secretly kept it for himself. Yuan Shao and [[Gongsun Zan]] were at war in the north while Sun Jian and [[Liu Biao]] were battling in the south. Others such as Cao Cao and [[Liu Bei]], who initially had no titles or land, were also gradually forming their own armies and taking control of territories.\n\nDuring those times of upheaval, Cao Cao saved Emperor Xian from the remnants of Dong Zhuo's forces, established the new imperial capital in [[Xuchang|Xu]] and became the new head of the central government. He defeated rival warlords such as [[L\u00fc Bu]], [[Yuan Shu]] and [[Zhang Xiu (warlord)|Zhang Xiu]] in a series of wars in central China before scoring a decisive victory over Yuan Shao at the [[Battle of Guandu]]. Through his conquests, Cao Cao united central and northern China under his control. The territories he conquered served as the foundation of the state of [[Cao Wei]] in the future.\n\n===Sun Ce builds a dynasty in Jiangdong===\nMeanwhile, an ambush violently concluded Sun Jian's life at the [[Battle of Xiangyang (191)|Battle of Xiangyang]] against Liu Biao. His eldest son, [[Sun Ce]], delivered the Imperial Seal as a tribute to the rising [[pretender]], [[Yuan Shu]], in exchange for reinforcements. Sun Ce secured himself a state in the rich riverlands of [[Jiangnan|Jiangdong]] ([[Wu (region)|Wu]]), on which the state of [[Eastern Wu]] was founded later. Tragically, Sun Ce also died at the pinnacle of his career from illness under stress of his terrifying encounter with the ghost of [[Gan Ji|Yu Ji]], a venerable magician whom he had falsely accused of heresy and executed in jealousy. However, [[Sun Quan]], his younger brother and successor, proved to be a capable and charismatic ruler. With assistance from [[Zhou Yu]], [[Zhang Zhao]] and others, Sun Quan inspired hidden talents such as [[Lu Su]] to serve him, built up his military forces and maintained stability in Jiangdong.\n\n===Liu Bei's ambition===\n[[File:Dai Jin-Looking Three Times at the Thatched Hut.jpg|thumb|200px|Liu Bei recruiting Zhuge Liang, from ''Visiting the Thatched Hut Three Times'', a [[Ming dynasty]] painting by [[Dai Jin]] (1388\u20131462).]]\n\n[[Liu Bei]] and his oath brothers [[Guan Yu]] and [[Zhang Fei]] swore allegiance to the Han Empire in the [[Oath of the Peach Garden]] and pledged to do their best for the people. However, their ambitions were not realised as they did not receive due recognition for helping to suppress the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] and participating in the [[campaign against Dong Zhuo]]. After Liu Bei succeeded [[Tao Qian (Han dynasty)|Tao Qian]] as the governor of [[Xu Province]], he offered shelter to [[L\u00fc Bu]], who had just been defeated by Cao Cao. However, L\u00fc Bu betrayed his host, seized control of the province and attacked Liu Bei. Liu Bei combined forces with Cao Cao and defeated L\u00fc Bu at the [[Battle of Xiapi]]. Liu Bei then followed Cao Cao back to the imperial capital, Xu, where Emperor Xian honoured him as his \"Imperial Uncle\". When Cao Cao showed signs that he wanted to usurp the throne, Emperor Xian wrote a secret decree in blood to his father-in-law, [[Dong Cheng (Han dynasty)|Dong Cheng]], and ordered him to get rid of Cao. Dong Cheng secretly contacted Liu Bei and others and they planned to assassinate Cao Cao. However, the plot was leaked out and Cao Cao had Dong Cheng and the others arrested and [[Nine familial exterminations|executed along with their families]].\n\nLiu Bei had already left the imperial capital when the plot was exposed. He seized control of Xu Province from [[Che Zhou]], the new governor appointed by Cao Cao. In retaliation, Cao Cao attacked Xu Province and defeated Liu Bei, forcing him to take shelter under Yuan Shao for a brief period of time. Liu Bei eventually left Yuan Shao and established a new base in [[Runan Commandery|Runan]], where he lost to Cao Cao again. He retreated south to [[Jing Province]], where he found shelter under the governor, [[Liu Biao]].\n\n===Battle of Guandu===\nIn 200, Dong Cheng, an imperial relative, received a secret edict from Emperor Xian to assassinate Cao Cao. He collaborated with Liu Bei on this effort, but Cao Cao soon found out about the plot and had Dong Cheng and his conspirators executed, with only Liu Bei surviving and fleeing to join Yuan Shao in the north.\n\nAfter settling the nearby provinces, including a rebellion led by former Yellow Turbans, and internal affairs with the court, Cao Cao turned his attention north to Yuan Shao, who himself had eliminated his northern rival Gongsun Zan that same year. Yuan Shao, himself of higher nobility than Cao Cao, amassed a large army and camped along the northern bank of the Yellow River.\n\nIn the summer of 200, after months of preparations, the armies of Cao Cao and Yuan Shao clashed at the Battle of Guandu (near present-day Kaifeng). Cao Cao's army was heavily outnumbered by Yuan Shao. Due to a raid in Yuan's supply train, Yuan's army fell into disorder as they fled back north.\n\nCao Cao took advantage of Yuan Shao's death in 202, which resulted in division among his sons, and advanced to the north. In 204, after the Battle of Ye, Cao Cao captured the city of Ye. \n\nBy the end of 207, after a victorious campaign beyond the frontier against the Wuhuan culminating in the Battle of White Wolf Mountain, Cao Cao achieved complete dominance of the North China Plain. He now controlled China's heartland, including Yuan Shao's former territory, and half of the Chinese population.\n\n===Battle of Changban===\nSince 200, Liu Biao put Liu Bei in charge of [[Xinye County|Xinye]], where Liu Bei visited [[Zhuge Liang]] thrice and recruited him as an adviser. He also built up his forces in preparation for war against Cao Cao.\n\nFollowing his unification of central and northern China under his control, Cao Cao, having been appointed [[Chancellor (China)|Imperial Chancellor]] by Emperor Xian, led his forces on a southern campaign to eliminate Liu Bei and Sun Quan. \n\nIn 208, Although Liu Bei managed to repel two attacks by Cao Cao at Xinye, he was eventually forced to flee due to the overwhelming strength of the enemy forces. Cao Cao and his cavalry caught up to Liu Bei's congregation at Changban, Dangyang, and Liu Bei had to flee for his life, galloping away south with Zhang Fei, Zhao Yun and Zhuge Liang, while leaving his family and the populace behind. Cao Cao's forces captured most of the unarmed civilians and Liu Bei's baggage. In the chaos, Zhao Yun disappeared to the north, but he came back with Liu Bei's infant son Liu Shan along with Lady Gan. \n\nTurning east from Changban, Liu Bei and the remnants of his party had crossed the Han River to the east where Liu Qi, Liu Biao's elder son, still held control of Jiangxia Commandery. They met Guan Yu's fleet and over 10,000 men led by Liu Qi at Han Ford. Together, they sailed down the river to Xiakou.\n\nCao Cao did not follow up in immediate pursuit. The main objective of his drive to the south had been the base at Jiangling County, and he pressed on south to secure that base first. use code lazar in the FORNITE item shop\n\n===Battle of Red Cliffs===\nIn 208, After the Battle of Changban. Liu Bei sent Zhuge Liang to meet Sun Quan and discuss the formation of a Sun\u2013Liu alliance to counter Cao Cao. Sun Quan agreed and placed Zhou Yu in command of his army in preparation for war with Cao Cao. Zhuge Liang remained temporarily in Wu territory to assist Zhou Yu. Zhou Yu felt that Zhuge Liang would become a threat to Sun Quan in the future and attempted to kill him on a few occasions but ultimately failed and ended up having no choice but to cooperate with Zhuge Liang. The Sun\u2013Liu forces scored a decisive victory over Cao Cao at the [[Battle of Red Cliffs]].\n\n[[File:Chibi.jpg|thumb|200px|Traditional site of the Red Cliffs.]]\n\nSun Quan and Liu Bei started vying for control of southern [[Jing Province]] after their victory, but Liu won and took over the territories from Cao Cao's general, [[Cao Ren]]. Sun Quan, unhappy over having gained nothing, sent messengers to ask Liu Bei to \"return\" the territories to him, but Liu dismissed the messenger each time with a different excuse. Sun Quan was unwilling to give up, so he followed Zhou Yu's plan to trick Liu Bei to come to his territory and marry his sister, [[Lady Sun]]. He would then hold Liu Bei hostage in exchange for Jing Province. However, the plan failed and the newlywed couple returned to Jing Province safely. Zhou Yu later died in frustration after Zhuge Liang repeatedly foiled his plans to take Jing Province.\n\n===Liu Bei's takeover of Yi Province===\nRelations between Liu Bei and Sun Quan deteriorated after Zhou Yu's death, but not to the point of war. Following Zhuge Liang's [[Longzhong Plan]], Liu Bei led his forces westward into [[Yi Province]] and [[Liu Bei's takeover of Yi Province|seized control of the territories]] from the governor, [[Liu Zhang (warlord)|Liu Zhang]]. By then, Liu Bei ruled over a vast stretch of land from Yi Province to southern Jing Province; these territories served as the foundation of the state of [[Shu Han]] later. Liu Bei declared himself King of Hanzhong after defeating Cao Cao in the [[Hanzhong Campaign]] and capturing Hanzhong Commandery.\n\nAt the same time, Emperor Xian awarded Cao Cao the title of a [[vassal]] king \u2013 King of Wei \u2013 while Sun Quan was known as the Duke of Wu. In eastern China, Sun Quan and Cao Cao's forces fought in various battles along the [[Yangtze River]], including the battles of [[Battle of Xiaoyao Ford|Hefei]] and [[Battle of Ruxukou (217)|Ruxu]], but neither side managed to gain a significant advantage over the other.\n\n===Death of Guan Yu===\n[[File:Chengdu 2007 360.jpg|thumb|right|[[Shadow puppet]]s in the Sichuan Provincial Museum depicting [[Guan Yu]] and [[Zhang Fei]].]]\nMeanwhile, Sun Quan plotted to take Jing Province after growing tired of Liu Bei's repeated refusals to hand over the province. He secretly made peace and allied with Cao Cao against Liu Bei. While Guan Yu, who guarded Liu Bei's territories in Jing Province, was away attacking [[Cao Ren]] at the [[Battle of Fancheng]], Sun Quan sent his general [[L\u00fc Meng]] to launch [[L\u00fc Meng's invasion of Jing Province|a stealth invasion on Jing Province]]. Guan Yu was unable to capture Fancheng so he retreated, but was caught off guard by L\u00fc Meng and had already lost Jing Province before he knew it. With his army's morale falling and the troops gradually deserting, Guan Yu and his remaining men withdrew to Maicheng, where they were surrounded by Sun Quan's forces. In desperation, Guan Yu attempted to break out of the siege but failed and was captured in an ambush. Sun Quan had him executed after he refused to surrender.\n\nShortly after Guan Yu's death, Cao Cao died of a brain tumour in Luoyang. His son and successor, [[Cao Pi]], forced Emperor Xian to abdicate the throne to him and established the state of [[Cao Wei]] to replace the Han dynasty. About a year later, Liu Bei declared himself emperor and founded the state of [[Shu Han]] as a continuation of the Han dynasty. While Liu Bei was planning to avenge Guan Yu, Zhang Fei was assassinated in his sleep by his subordinates.\n\n===Battle of Yiling===\nAs Liu Bei led a large army to avenge Guan Yu and retake Jing Province, Sun Quan attempted to appease him by offering to return him the territories in southern Jing Province. Liu Bei's subjects urged him to accept Sun Quan's offer but Liu insisted on avenging his sworn brother. After initial victories against Sun Quan's forces, a series of strategic mistakes resulted in Liu Bei's calamitous defeat at the [[Battle of Xiaoting|Battle of Xiaoting/Yiling]] by Sun Quan's general, [[Lu Xun (Three Kingdoms)|Lu Xun]]. Lu Xun initially pursued Liu Bei while the latter retreated after his defeat, but gave up after getting trapped inside and barely escaping from Zhuge Liang's [[Stone Sentinel Maze]].\n\n[[File:Zhuge Liang.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An artist's impression of [[Zhuge Liang]].]]\n\nLiu Bei died in [[Baidicheng]] from illness a few months later. On his deathbed, Liu Bei granted Zhuge Liang permission to take the throne if his son and successor, [[Liu Shan]], proved to be an inept ruler. Zhuge Liang firmly refused and swore to remain faithful to the trust Liu Bei had placed in him. cao cao shall die s u b t o p e w d i e p i e\n\n===Zhuge Liang's campaigns===\nAfter Liu Bei's death, Cao Pi induced several forces, including Sun Quan, a turncoat Shu general [[Meng Da]], the [[Nanman]] and [[Qiang people|Qiang]] tribes, to attack Shu, in coordination with a Wei army. However, Zhuge Liang managed to make the five armies retreat without any bloodshed. He also sent [[Deng Zhi]] to make peace with Sun Quan and restore the alliance between Shu and Wu. Zhuge Liang then personally led [[Zhuge Liang's Southern Campaign|a southern campaign]] against the Nanman, defeated them seven times, and won the allegiance of the Nanman king, [[Meng Huo]].\n\nAfter pacifying the south, Zhuge Liang led the Shu army on [[Zhuge Liang's Northern Expeditions|five military expeditions]] to attack Wei as part of his mission to restore the Han dynasty. However, his days were numbered because he had been suffering from chronic illness and his condition worsened under stress. He would die of illness at the [[Battle of Wuzhang Plains]] while leading a stalemate battle against the Wei general [[Sima Yi]].\n\n===End of the Three Kingdoms===\nThe long years of battle between Shu and Wei saw many changes in the ruling Cao family in Wei. The influence of the Caos weakened after [[Cao Rui]]'s death and state power eventually fell into the hands of the regent Sima Yi and subsequently to his sons, [[Sima Shi]] and [[Sima Zhao]].\n\nIn Shu, [[Jiang Wei]] inherited Zhuge Liang's legacy and continued to lead another [[Jiang Wei's Northern Expeditions|nine campaigns]] against Wei for three decades, but ultimately failed to achieve any significant success. The Shu emperor [[Liu Shan]] also turned out to be an incompetent ruler who trusted corrupt officials. Shu gradually declined under Liu Shan's rule and was eventually [[Conquest of Shu by Wei|conquered by Wei forces]]. Jiang Wei attempted to restore Shu with the help of [[Zhong Hui]], a Wei general dissatisfied with Sima Zhao, but their plan failed and both of them were killed by Wei soldiers. Shortly after the fall of Shu, Sima Zhao died and his son, [[Emperor Wu of Jin|Sima Yan]], forced the last Wei emperor, [[Cao Huan]], to abdicate the throne to him. Sima Yan then established the [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]] to replace the state of Cao Wei.\n\nIn Wu, there had been internal conflict among the nobles since Sun Quan's death. The regents [[Zhuge Ke]] and [[Sun Chen]] consecutively attempted to usurp the throne but were eventually ousted from power and eliminated in coups. Although stability was temporarily restored in Wu, the last Wu emperor, [[Sun Hao]], turned out to be a tyrant. Wu, the last of the Three Kingdoms, was eventually [[Conquest of Wu by Jin|conquered by the Jin dynasty]]. The fall of Wu marked the end of the near century-long era of civil strife historically known as the Three Kingdoms period.\n\n==Historical accuracy==\n{{See also|List of fictitious stories in Romance of the Three Kingdoms}}\n\nThe novel draws from historical sources, including [[Chen Shou]]'s ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]''.

While the novel follows hundreds of characters, the focus is mainly on the three power blocs that emerged from the remnants of the Han dynasty, and would eventually form the three states of [[Cao Wei]], [[Shu Han]], and [[Eastern Wu]]. The novel deals with the plots, personal and military battles, intrigues, and struggles of these states to achieve dominance for almost 100 years.\n\n''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'' is acclaimed as one of the [[Classic Chinese Novels|Four Great Classical Novels]] of [[Chinese literature]]; it has a total of 800,000 words and nearly a thousand dramatic characters (mostly historical) in 120 chapters.<ref name=\"roberts940\">Roberts 1991, pg. 940</ref> The novel is among the most beloved works of literature in [[East Asia]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2892148|title=(Review) Historical China film lives up to expectations|last=Kim|first=Hyung-eun|website=Korea JoongAng Daily|date=11 July 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111225000000/http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2892148|archivedate=25 December 2011|quote=The ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'' is comparable to the Bible in East Asia.

The novel also includes material from [[Tang dynasty]] poetic works, Yuan dynasty operas and his own personal interpretation of elements such as virtue and legitimacy. The author combined this historical knowledge with a gift for storytelling to create a rich tapestry of personalities.<ref>Roberts, pp. 946\u201353.</ref>\n\n===Recensions and standardised text===\nSeveral versions of the expanded ''Sanguozhi'' are extant today. Luo Guanzhong's version in 24 volumes, known as the ''Sanguozhi Tongsu Yanyi'', is now held in the [[Shanghai Library]] in China, [[Tenri Central Library]] in Japan, and several other major libraries. Various 10-volume, 12-volume and 20-volume recensions of Luo's text, made between 1522 and 1690, are also held at libraries around the world. However, the standard text familiar to general readers is a [[recension]] by Mao Lun and his son [[Mao Zonggang]].\n\nIn the 1660s, during the reign of the [[Kangxi Emperor]] in the [[Qing dynasty]], Mao Lun and Mao Zonggang significantly edited the text, fitting it into 120 chapters, and abbreviating the title to ''Sanguozhi Yanyi''.<ref name=\"roberts980\" /> The text was reduced from 900,000 to 750,000 characters; significant editing was done for narrative flow; use of third-party poems was reduced and shifted from conventional verse to finer pieces; and most passages praising [[Cao Cao]]'s advisers and generals were removed.<ref name=\"roberts965\">Roberts 1991, pg. 965</ref> Scholars have long debated whether the Maos' viewpoint was anti-Qing (identifying Southern Ming remnants with Shu-Han) or pro-Qing.<ref name=\"roberts967 71\">Roberts 1991, pp. 967\u2013971</ref>\n\nThe famous opening lines of the novel, \"[[Tianxia|The empire]], long divided, must unite; long united, must divide.

The novel contains numerous subplots. The following consists of a summary of the central plot and some well-known highlights in the novel.\n\n[[File:Three Brothers (Bei, Yu, Fei).jpg|thumb|200px|''Three Heroes of Three Kingdoms'', silk painting by Sekkan Sakurai (1715\u20131790), depicting Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei.]]\n\n===Yellow Turban Rebellion and the Ten Attendants===\nIn the [[End of the Han dynasty|final years]] of the [[Eastern Han dynasty]], treacherous [[eunuch]]s and villainous officials deceived the emperor and persecuted good officials. The government gradually became extremely corrupt on all levels, leading to widespread deterioration of the Han Empire. During the reign of [[Emperor Ling of Han|Emperor Ling]], the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] broke out under the leadership of [[Zhang Jue|Zhang Jiao]].\n\nThe rebellion was barely suppressed by imperial forces led by the general [[He Jin]]. Upon Emperor Ling's death, He Jin installed the young [[Liu Bian|Emperor Shao]] on the throne and took control of the central government. The [[Ten Attendants]], a group of influential court eunuchs, feared that He Jin was growing too powerful, so they lured him into the palace and assassinated him. In revenge, He Jin's supporters broke into the palace and indiscriminately slaughtered any person who looked like a eunuch. In the ensuing chaos, Emperor Shao and his younger half-brother, the [[Emperor Xian of Han|Prince of Chenliu]], disappeared from the palace.\n\n===Dong Zhuo's tyranny===\nThe missing emperor and the prince were found by soldiers of the warlord [[Dong Zhuo]], who seized control of the imperial capital, [[Luoyang]], under the pretext of protecting the emperor. Dong Zhuo later deposed Emperor Shao and replaced him with the Prince of Chenliu ([[Emperor Xian of Han|Emperor Xian]]), who was merely a figurehead under his control. Dong Zhuo monopolised state power, persecuted his political opponents and oppressed the common people for his personal gain. There were two attempts on his life: the first was by a military officer, Wu Fu (\u4f0d\u5b5a), who failed and died a gruesome death; the second was by [[Cao Cao]], whose attempt went awry and forced him to flee.\n\nCao Cao escaped from Luoyang, returned to his hometown and sent out a fake imperial edict to various regional officials and warlords, calling them to rise up against Dong Zhuo. Under [[Yuan Shao]]'s leadership, 18 warlords formed a coalition army and launched a punitive [[campaign against Dong Zhuo]]. Dong Zhuo felt threatened after losing the battles of [[Battle of Sishui Pass|Sishui Pass]] and [[Battle of Hulao Pass|Hulao Pass]], so he evacuated Luoyang and moved the imperial capital to [[Chang'an]]. He forced Luoyang's residents to move together with him and had the city set aflame. The coalition eventually broke up due to poor leadership and conflicting interests among its members. Meanwhile, in Chang'an, Dong Zhuo was betrayed and murdered by his foster son [[L\u00fc Bu]] in a dispute over the maiden [[Diaochan]] as part of a plot orchestrated by the minister [[Wang Yun (Han dynasty)|Wang Yun]].\n\n===Conflict among the various warlords and nobles===\nIn the meantime, the Han Empire was already disintegrating into civil war as warlords fought for territories and power. [[Sun Jian]] found the [[Imperial Seal of China|Imperial Seal]] in the ruins of Luoyang and secretly kept it for himself. Yuan Shao and [[Gongsun Zan]] were at war in the north while Sun Jian and [[Liu Biao]] were battling in the south. Others such as Cao Cao and [[Liu Bei]], who initially had no titles or land, were also gradually forming their own armies and taking control of territories.\n\nDuring those times of upheaval, Cao Cao saved Emperor Xian from the remnants of Dong Zhuo's forces, established the new imperial capital in [[Xuchang|Xu]] and became the new head of the central government. He defeated rival warlords such as [[L\u00fc Bu]], [[Yuan Shu]] and [[Zhang Xiu (warlord)|Zhang Xiu]] in a series of wars in central China before scoring a decisive victory over Yuan Shao at the [[Battle of Guandu]]. Through his conquests, Cao Cao united central and northern China under his control. The territories he conquered served as the foundation of the state of [[Cao Wei]] in the future.\n\n===Sun Ce builds a dynasty in Jiangdong===\nMeanwhile, an ambush violently concluded Sun Jian's life at the [[Battle of Xiangyang (191)|Battle of Xiangyang]] against Liu Biao. His eldest son, [[Sun Ce]], delivered the Imperial Seal as a tribute to the rising [[pretender]], [[Yuan Shu]], in exchange for reinforcements. Sun Ce secured himself a state in the rich riverlands of [[Jiangnan|Jiangdong]] ([[Wu (region)|Wu]]), on which the state of [[Eastern Wu]] was founded later. Tragically, Sun Ce also died at the pinnacle of his career from illness under stress of his terrifying encounter with the ghost of [[Gan Ji|Yu Ji]], a venerable magician whom he had falsely accused of heresy and executed in jealousy. However, [[Sun Quan]], his younger brother and successor, proved to be a capable and charismatic ruler. With assistance from [[Zhou Yu]], [[Zhang Zhao]] and others, Sun Quan inspired hidden talents such as [[Lu Su]] to serve him, built up his military forces and maintained stability in Jiangdong.\n\n===Liu Bei's ambition===\n[[File:Dai Jin-Looking Three Times at the Thatched Hut.jpg|thumb|200px|Liu Bei recruiting Zhuge Liang, from ''Visiting the Thatched Hut Three Times'', a [[Ming dynasty]] painting by [[Dai Jin]] (1388\u20131462).]]\n\n[[Liu Bei]] and his oath brothers [[Guan Yu]] and [[Zhang Fei]] swore allegiance to the Han Empire in the [[Oath of the Peach Garden]] and pledged to do their best for the people. However, their ambitions were not realised as they did not receive due recognition for helping to suppress the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] and participating in the [[campaign against Dong Zhuo]]. After Liu Bei succeeded [[Tao Qian (Han dynasty)|Tao Qian]] as the governor of [[Xu Province]], he offered shelter to [[L\u00fc Bu]], who had just been defeated by Cao Cao. However, L\u00fc Bu betrayed his host, seized control of the province and attacked Liu Bei. Liu Bei combined forces with Cao Cao and defeated L\u00fc Bu at the [[Battle of Xiapi]]. Liu Bei then followed Cao Cao back to the imperial capital, Xu, where Emperor Xian honoured him as his \"Imperial Uncle\". When Cao Cao showed signs that he wanted to usurp the throne, Emperor Xian wrote a secret decree in blood to his father-in-law, [[Dong Cheng (Han dynasty)|Dong Cheng]], and ordered him to get rid of Cao. Dong Cheng secretly contacted Liu Bei and others and they planned to assassinate Cao Cao. However, the plot was leaked out and Cao Cao had Dong Cheng and the others arrested and [[Nine familial exterminations|executed along with their families]].\n\nLiu Bei had already left the imperial capital when the plot was exposed. He seized control of Xu Province from [[Che Zhou]], the new governor appointed by Cao Cao. In retaliation, Cao Cao attacked Xu Province and defeated Liu Bei, forcing him to take shelter under Yuan Shao for a brief period of time. Liu Bei eventually left Yuan Shao and established a new base in [[Runan Commandery|Runan]], where he lost to Cao Cao again. He retreated south to [[Jing Province]], where he found shelter under the governor, [[Liu Biao]].\n\n===Battle of Guandu===\nIn 200, Dong Cheng, an imperial relative, received a secret edict from Emperor Xian to assassinate Cao Cao. He collaborated with Liu Bei on this effort, but Cao Cao soon found out about the plot and had Dong Cheng and his conspirators executed, with only Liu Bei surviving and fleeing to join Yuan Shao in the north.\n\nAfter settling the nearby provinces, including a rebellion led by former Yellow Turbans, and internal affairs with the court, Cao Cao turned his attention north to Yuan Shao, who himself had eliminated his northern rival Gongsun Zan that same year. Yuan Shao, himself of higher nobility than Cao Cao, amassed a large army and camped along the northern bank of the Yellow River.\n\nIn the summer of 200, after months of preparations, the armies of Cao Cao and Yuan Shao clashed at the Battle of Guandu (near present-day Kaifeng). Cao Cao's army was heavily outnumbered by Yuan Shao. Due to a raid in Yuan's supply train, Yuan's army fell into disorder as they fled back north.\n\nCao Cao took advantage of Yuan Shao's death in 202, which resulted in division among his sons, and advanced to the north. In 204, after the Battle of Ye, Cao Cao captured the city of Ye. \n\nBy the end of 207, after a victorious campaign beyond the frontier against the Wuhuan culminating in the Battle of White Wolf Mountain, Cao Cao achieved complete dominance of the North China Plain. He now controlled China's heartland, including Yuan Shao's former territory, and half of the Chinese population.\n\n===Battle of Changban===\nSince 200, Liu Biao put Liu Bei in charge of [[Xinye County|Xinye]], where Liu Bei visited [[Zhuge Liang]] thrice and recruited him as an adviser. He also built up his forces in preparation for war against Cao Cao.\n\nFollowing his unification of central and northern China under his control, Cao Cao, having been appointed [[Chancellor (China)|Imperial Chancellor]] by Emperor Xian, led his forces on a southern campaign to eliminate Liu Bei and Sun Quan. \n\nIn 208, Although Liu Bei managed to repel two attacks by Cao Cao at Xinye, he was eventually forced to flee due to the overwhelming strength of the enemy forces. Cao Cao and his cavalry caught up to Liu Bei's congregation at Changban, Dangyang, and Liu Bei had to flee for his life, galloping away south with Zhang Fei, Zhao Yun and Zhuge Liang, while leaving his family and the populace behind. Cao Cao's forces captured most of the unarmed civilians and Liu Bei's baggage. In the chaos, Zhao Yun disappeared to the north, but he came back with Liu Bei's infant son Liu Shan along with Lady Gan. \n\nTurning east from Changban, Liu Bei and the remnants of his party had crossed the Han River to the east where Liu Qi, Liu Biao's elder son, still held control of Jiangxia Commandery. They met Guan Yu's fleet and over 10,000 men led by Liu Qi at Han Ford. Together, they sailed down the river to Xiakou.\n\nCao Cao did not follow up in immediate pursuit. The main objective of his drive to the south had been the base at Jiangling County, and he pressed on south to secure that base first.\n\n===Battle of Red Cliffs===\nIn 208, After the Battle of Changban. Liu Bei sent Zhuge Liang to meet Sun Quan and discuss the formation of a Sun\u2013Liu alliance to counter Cao Cao. Sun Quan agreed and placed Zhou Yu in command of his army in preparation for war with Cao Cao. Zhuge Liang remained temporarily in Wu territory to assist Zhou Yu. Zhou Yu felt that Zhuge Liang would become a threat to Sun Quan in the future and attempted to kill him on a few occasions but ultimately failed and ended up having no choice but to cooperate with Zhuge Liang. The Sun\u2013Liu forces scored a decisive victory over Cao Cao at the [[Battle of Red Cliffs]].\n\n[[File:Chibi.jpg|thumb|200px|Traditional site of the Red Cliffs.]]\n\nSun Quan and Liu Bei started vying for control of southern [[Jing Province]] after their victory, but Liu won and took over the territories from Cao Cao's general, [[Cao Ren]]. Sun Quan, unhappy over having gained nothing, sent messengers to ask Liu Bei to \"return\" the territories to him, but Liu dismissed the messenger each time with a different excuse. Sun Quan was unwilling to give up, so he followed Zhou Yu's plan to trick Liu Bei to come to his territory and marry his sister, [[Lady Sun]]. He would then hold Liu Bei hostage in exchange for Jing Province. However, the plan failed and the newlywed couple returned to Jing Province safely. Zhou Yu later died in frustration after Zhuge Liang repeatedly foiled his plans to take Jing Province.\n\n===Liu Bei's takeover of Yi Province===\nRelations between Liu Bei and Sun Quan deteriorated after Zhou Yu's death, but not to the point of war. Following Zhuge Liang's [[Longzhong Plan]], Liu Bei led his forces westward into [[Yi Province]] and [[Liu Bei's takeover of Yi Province|seized control of the territories]] from the governor, [[Liu Zhang (warlord)|Liu Zhang]]. By then, Liu Bei ruled over a vast stretch of land from Yi Province to southern Jing Province; these territories served as the foundation of the state of [[Shu Han]] later. Liu Bei declared himself King of Hanzhong after defeating Cao Cao in the [[Hanzhong Campaign]] and capturing Hanzhong Commandery.\n\nAt the same time, Emperor Xian awarded Cao Cao the title of a [[vassal]] king \u2013 King of Wei \u2013 while Sun Quan was known as the Duke of Wu. In eastern China, Sun Quan and Cao Cao's forces fought in various battles along the [[Yangtze River]], including the battles of [[Battle of Xiaoyao Ford|Hefei]] and [[Battle of Ruxukou (217)|Ruxu]], but neither side managed to gain a significant advantage over the other.\n\n===Death of Guan Yu===\n[[File:Chengdu 2007 360.jpg|thumb|right|[[Shadow puppet]]s in the Sichuan Provincial Museum depicting [[Guan Yu]] and [[Zhang Fei]].]]\nMeanwhile, Sun Quan plotted to take Jing Province after growing tired of Liu Bei's repeated refusals to hand over the province. He secretly made peace and allied with Cao Cao against Liu Bei. While Guan Yu, who guarded Liu Bei's territories in Jing Province, was away attacking [[Cao Ren]] at the [[Battle of Fancheng]], Sun Quan sent his general [[L\u00fc Meng]] to launch [[L\u00fc Meng's invasion of Jing Province|a stealth invasion on Jing Province]]. Guan Yu was unable to capture Fancheng so he retreated, but was caught off guard by L\u00fc Meng and had already lost Jing Province before he knew it. With his army's morale falling and the troops gradually deserting, Guan Yu and his remaining men withdrew to Maicheng, where they were surrounded by Sun Quan's forces. In desperation, Guan Yu attempted to break out of the siege but failed and was captured in an ambush. Sun Quan had him executed after he refused to surrender.\n\nShortly after Guan Yu's death, Cao Cao died of a brain tumour in Luoyang. His son and successor, [[Cao Pi]], forced Emperor Xian to abdicate the throne to him and established the state of [[Cao Wei]] to replace the Han dynasty. About a year later, Liu Bei declared himself emperor and founded the state of [[Shu Han]] as a continuation of the Han dynasty. While Liu Bei was planning to avenge Guan Yu, Zhang Fei was assassinated in his sleep by his subordinates.\n\n===Battle of Yiling===\nAs Liu Bei led a large army to avenge Guan Yu and retake Jing Province, Sun Quan attempted to appease him by offering to return him the territories in southern Jing Province. Liu Bei's subjects urged him to accept Sun Quan's offer but Liu insisted on avenging his sworn brother. After initial victories against Sun Quan's forces, a series of strategic mistakes resulted in Liu Bei's calamitous defeat at the [[Battle of Xiaoting|Battle of Xiaoting/Yiling]] by Sun Quan's general, [[Lu Xun (Three Kingdoms)|Lu Xun]]. Lu Xun initially pursued Liu Bei while the latter retreated after his defeat, but gave up after getting trapped inside and barely escaping from Zhuge Liang's [[Stone Sentinel Maze]].\n\n[[File:Zhuge Liang.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An artist's impression of [[Zhuge Liang]].]]\n\nLiu Bei died in [[Baidicheng]] from illness a few months later. On his deathbed, Liu Bei granted Zhuge Liang permission to take the throne if his son and successor, [[Liu Shan]], proved to be an inept ruler. Zhuge Liang firmly refused and swore to remain faithful to the trust Liu Bei had placed in him.\n\n===Zhuge Liang's campaigns===\nAfter Liu Bei's death, Cao Pi induced several forces, including Sun Quan, a turncoat Shu general [[Meng Da]], the [[Nanman]] and [[Qiang people|Qiang]] tribes, to attack Shu, in coordination with a Wei army. However, Zhuge Liang managed to make the five armies retreat without any bloodshed. He also sent [[Deng Zhi]] to make peace with Sun Quan and restore the alliance between Shu and Wu. Zhuge Liang then personally led [[Zhuge Liang's Southern Campaign|a southern campaign]] against the Nanman, defeated them seven times, and won the allegiance of the Nanman king, [[Meng Huo]].\n\nAfter pacifying the south, Zhuge Liang led the Shu army on [[Zhuge Liang's Northern Expeditions|five military expeditions]] to attack Wei as part of his mission to restore the Han dynasty. However, his days were numbered because he had been suffering from chronic illness and his condition worsened under stress. He would die of illness at the [[Battle of Wuzhang Plains]] while leading a stalemate battle against the Wei general [[Sima Yi]].\n\n===End of the Three Kingdoms===\nThe long years of battle between Shu and Wei saw many changes in the ruling Cao family in Wei. The influence of the Caos weakened after [[Cao Rui]]'s death and state power eventually fell into the hands of the regent Sima Yi and subsequently to his sons, [[Sima Shi]] and [[Sima Zhao]].\n\nIn Shu, [[Jiang Wei]] inherited Zhuge Liang's legacy and continued to lead another [[Jiang Wei's Northern Expeditions|nine campaigns]] against Wei for three decades, but ultimately failed to achieve any significant success. The Shu emperor [[Liu Shan]] also turned out to be an incompetent ruler who trusted corrupt officials. Shu gradually declined under Liu Shan's rule and was eventually [[Conquest of Shu by Wei|conquered by Wei forces]]. Jiang Wei attempted to restore Shu with the help of [[Zhong Hui]], a Wei general dissatisfied with Sima Zhao, but their plan failed and both of them were killed by Wei soldiers. Shortly after the fall of Shu, Sima Zhao died and his son, [[Emperor Wu of Jin|Sima Yan]], forced the last Wei emperor, [[Cao Huan]], to abdicate the throne to him. Sima Yan then established the [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]] to replace the state of Cao Wei.\n\nIn Wu, there had been internal conflict among the nobles since Sun Quan's death. The regents [[Zhuge Ke]] and [[Sun Chen]] consecutively attempted to usurp the throne but were eventually ousted from power and eliminated in coups. Although stability was temporarily restored in Wu, the last Wu emperor, [[Sun Hao]], turned out to be a tyrant. Wu, the last of the Three Kingdoms, was eventually [[Conquest of Wu by Jin|conquered by the Jin dynasty]]. The fall of Wu marked the end of the near century-long era of civil strife historically known as the Three Kingdoms period.\n\n==Historical accuracy==\n{{See also|List of fictitious stories in Romance of the Three Kingdoms}}\n\nThe novel draws from historical sources, including [[Chen Shou]]'s ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]''.

This suited the political climate in the Ming dynasty, unlike in the Jin dynasty when Cao Wei was considered the legitimate successor to the Han dynasty.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nSome non-historical scenes in the novel have become well-known and subsequently became a part of traditional Chinese culture.\n\n==Literary analysis==\n[[File:Pang De Portrait.jpg|thumb|200px|A depiction of [[Pang De]] at the [[Battle of Fancheng]], from a [[Qing dynasty]] edition of the ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms''.]]\n\nIn the introduction to the 1959 reprint of the [[Charles Henry Brewitt-Taylor|Brewitt-Taylor]] translation, Roy Andrew Miller argues that the novel's chief theme is \"the nature of human ambition\".<ref name=\":1\" /> to which Moody adds the relationship between politics and morality, specifically the conflict between the idealism of [[Confucianism|Confucian]] political thought and the harsh realism of [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], as a related theme.<ref name=\":1\" /> Other dominant themes of the novel include: the rise and fall of the ideal liege (Liu Bei); finding the ideal minister (Zhuge Liang); the conflict between the ideal liege (Liu Bei) and the consummate villain (Cao Cao); and the cruelties and injustice of feudal or dynastic government.<ref name=\"roberts940\" />\n\nThe opening lines of the novel, \"The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide.

One recent critic notes that the novel takes political and moral stands and lets the reader know which of the characters are heroes and which villains, yet the heroes are forced to make a tragic choice between equal values, not merely between good and evil. The heroes know that the end of the empire is ordained by this cosmic cycle of division and unity, yet their choices are moral, based on loyalty, not political.<ref name=Tung>Constantine Tung, \"Cosmic Foreordination and Human Commitment: The Tragic Volition in Three Kingdoms\", in Kimberly Ann Besio, Constantine Tung.

Despite this, many Jews did not embrace Zionism before the 1930s, and certain religious groups opposed it then, as some groups still do now, on the grounds that an attempt to re-establish Jewish rule in Israel by [[human agency]] was blasphemous. Hastening salvation and the coming of the Messiah was considered religiously forbidden, and Zionism was seen as a sign of disbelief in God's power, and therefore, a rebellion against God. Rabbi Kook developed a [[theology|theological]] answer to that claim, which gave Zionism a religious legitimation: \"Zionism was not merely a political movement by secular Jews. It was actually a tool of [[God]] to promote His divine scheme, and to initiate the return of the Jews to their homeland \u2013 the land He promised to [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]]. God wants the [[children of Israel]] to return to their home in order to establish a Jewish sovereign state in which Jews could live according to the laws of [[Torah]] and [[Halakha]], and commit the [[Mitzvah|Mitzvot]] of Eretz Israel (these are religious commandments which can be performed only in the [[Land of Israel]]). Moreover, to cultivate the Land of Israel was a Mitzvah by itself, and it should be carried out. Therefore, settling [[Eretz Israel|Israel]] is an obligation of the religious Jews, and helping Zionism is actually following God's will.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Torat Eretz Yisrael|first=David|last=Samson|author2=Tzvi Fishman |publisher=Torat Eretz Yisrael Publications|location=Jerusalem |year=1991}}</ref>\n\nReligious Jews also disapproved of the Zionists because many were secular Jews or [[atheist]]s, taking their cue from [[Marxism]]. [[Labour Zionism|Socialist Zionism]] envisaged the movement as a tool for building an advanced [[socialist]] society in the land of Israel, while solving the problem of [[antisemitism]]. The early [[kibbutz]] was a communal settlement that focused on national goals, unencumbered by religion and precepts of Jewish law such as [[kashrut]]. Socialist Zionists were one of the results of a long process of modernization within the Jewish communities of Europe, known as the [[Haskalah]], or Jewish Enlightenment. Rabbi Kook's answer was as follows:\n\n:''Secular Zionists may think they do it for political, national, or socialist reasons, but in fact \u2013 the actual reason for them coming to resettle in [[Eretz Israel|Israel]] is a religious Jewish spark (\"Nitzotz\") in their [[soul]], planted by God. Without their knowledge, they are contributing to the divine scheme and actually committing a great [[Mitzvah]].''\n\n:''The role of religious Zionists is to help them to establish a Jewish state and turn the religious spark in them into a great light. They should show them that the real source of Zionism and the longed-for Zion is [[Judaism]] and teach them [[Torah]] with love and kindness. In the end, they will understand that the laws of [[Torah]] are the key to true [[harmony]] and a [[socialist]] state (not in the [[Marxist]] [[Socialist mode of production|meaning]]) that will be a light for the [[goyim|nations]] and bring salvation to the world.''\n\n[[Shlomo Avineri]] explained the last part of Kook's answer: \"... and the end of those pioneers, who scout into the blindness of secularism and atheism, but the treasured light inside them leads them into the path of salvation \u2013 their end is that from doing Mitzva without purpose, they will do Mitzva with a purpose.\" (page 222, <sup>[[Religious Zionist Movement#References|1]]</sup>)\n\n== Organizations ==\n[[File:Bnei akiva logo.jpg|thumb|100px|left|[[Bnei Akiva]] youth movement, combining Torah and work]]\n\nThe first rabbis to support Zionism were [[Judah Alkalai|Yehuda Shlomo Alkalai]] and [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]]. They argued that the change in the status of [[Western Europe]]'s Jews following [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation]] was the first step toward redemption (\u05d2\u05d0\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4), and that, therefore, one must hasten the messianic salvation by a natural salvation \u2013 whose main pillars are the [[Kibbutz Galuyot]] (\"Gathering of the Exiles\"), the return to Eretz Israel, agricultural work (\u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05ea \u05d0\u05d3\u05de\u05d4), and the revival of the everyday use of the [[Hebrew language]].\n\nThe [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]] organization was established in 1902 in [[Vilna]] at a world conference of Religious Zionists. It operates a [[Zionist youth movement|youth movement]], [[Bnei Akiva]], which was founded in 1929. Mizrachi believes that the [[Torah]] should be at the centre of [[Zionism]], a sentiment expressed in the Mizrachi Zionist slogan ''Am Yisrael B'Eretz Yisrael al pi Torat Yisrael'' (\"The people of Israel in the land of Israel according to the Torah of Israel\"). It also sees Jewish nationalism as a tool for achieving religious objectives. Mizrachi was the first official Religious Zionist party. It also built a network of religious schools that exist to this day.\n\nIn 1937-1948, the [[Religious Kibbutz Movement]] established three settlement blocs of three kibbutzim each. The first was in the [[Beit Shean]] Valley, the second was in the [[Hebron]] mountains south of [[Bethlehem]] (known as [[Gush Etzion]]), and the third was in the western [[Negev]]. Kibbutz [[Yavne]] was founded in the center of the country as the core of a fourth bloc that came into being after the establishment of the state.<ref>\"Settlement clustering on a socio-cultural basis: The bloc settlement policy of the Religious Kibbutz Movement in Palestine,\" Yossi Katz, ''Journal of Rural Studies'', vol. 11, no. 2, pp. 161\u2013171, 1995</ref>\n\n== Political parties ==\nThe [[Labor Movement]] wing of Religious Zionism, founded in 1921 under the Zionist slogan \"Torah va'Avodah\" (Torah and Labor), was called [[Hapoel HaMizrachi]]. It represented religiously traditional [[Labour Zionism|Labour Zionists]], both in Europe and in the Land of Israel, where it represented religious Jews in the [[Histadrut]]. In 1956, Mizrachi, Hapoel HaMizrachi, and other religious Zionists formed the [[National Religious Party]] to advance the rights of religious Zionist Jews in Israel. Other parties and groups affiliated with religious Zionism are [[Gush Emunim]], [[Tkuma (political party)|Tkuma]], and [[Meimad]]. [[Kahanism]], a radical branch of religious Zionism, was founded by Rabbi [[Meir Kahane]], whose party, [[Kach and Kahane Chai|Kach]], was eventually banned for [[racism]]. Today, [[Otzma Yehudit]] is the leading wing of this school of thought.\n\n== Educational institutions ==\n:''See: [[Yeshiva #Israel]]; [[:Category:Religious Zionist yeshivot]]; [[List of Midrashot]].''\n[[File:Mercaz HaRav01.JPG|thumb|[[Mercaz Harav]], Jerusalem]]\nThe flagship religious institution of the Religious Zionist movement is the [[yeshiva]] founded by Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook in 1924, called in his honor \"[[Mercaz haRav]]\" (lit., the Rabbi's center). \nOther Religious Zionist yeshivot include [[Ateret Cohanim]], [[Beit El yeshiva]] and Yeshivat [[Or Etzion]], founded by Rav [[Haim Druckman]], a foremost disciple of Rabbi [[Tzvi Yehuda Kook]].\n\nThere are also approximately 90 ''[[Hesder]]'' yeshivot, allowing students to continue [[Torah study]] during their National Service (see [[#Military_service|below]]).\nThe first was [[Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh]], established in 1954; the largest is the [[Hesder Yeshiva of Sderot]] with over 800 students.\nOthers well known include [[Machon Meir|Yeshivat Machon Meir]], [[Yeshivat Har Etzion]], [[Yeshivat HaKotel]], [[Yeshivat Birkat Moshe]] in [[Maale Adumim]], [[Yeshiva Har Bracha|Yeshivat Har Bracha]] and Yeshivat Har Hamor.  \n\nThese institutions usually offer a [[kollel]] for ''[[Semikha]]'', or Rabbinic ordination. Students generally prepare for the ''Semikha'' test of the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]]; often for that of the [[posek]] R. [[Zalman Nechemia Goldberg]].\nTraining as a [[Dayan (rabbinic judge)]] in this community is usually through [[:he:\u05de\u05db\u05d5\u05df \u05d0\u05e8\u05d9\u05d0\u05dc|''Machon Ariel'']] (''[[Machon Harry Fischel]]''), also founded by Rav Kook, or [[:he:\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5_\u05d7\u05de\u05d3\u05d4_(\u05db\u05d5\u05dc\u05dc) |''Kollel Eretz Hemda'']].\n\nWomen study in institutions known as ''Midrashot'' (sing. [[Midrasha]]) - examples are [[Ein_HaNetziv#Education|Ein HaNatziv Women's Seminary]] and [[Migdal Oz (seminary)|Migdal Oz]]. Some also offer degree studies (and may then be known as a ''machon'').\n[[Nishmat (midrasha)|Nishmat]] trains women as [[Yoetzet Halacha|Yoatzot Halacha]]; see also [[Midreshet Lindenbaum]] and [[Matan Women's Institute for Torah Studies|Matan]], which similarly offer Talmud focused learning to women.\n\nHigh school students study at [[Education_in_Israel#Educational_tracks|''Mamlachti dati'']] schools, often associated with ''[[Bnei Akiva]]''. The first of these was at [[Kfar Haroeh]] established by [[Moshe-Zvi Neria]].\nFor degree studies, many attend [[Bar Ilan University]], which allows students to combine Yeshiva studies with university study; \n[[Jerusalem College of Technology]] similarly (which also offers a Haredi track).\nThere are also [[List_of_Israeli_universities_and_colleges#Colleges|several colleges of education]] associated with Hesder and the ''Midrashot'', such as [[Herzog College]] and the [[Lifshitz College of Education]]. These often allow specializations in [[Tanach]] and ''Machshava'' ([[Jewish thought]]).\n\n== Dress ==\nReligious Zionists are often called ''Kippot sruggot'', referring to the knitted or crocheted [[kippot|skullcaps]] (Hebrew ''kippa'', pl. ''kippot'') worn by many of the men. However, there are also men who wear other types of headcoverings, such as ''kippot'' in black velvet.\nAt prayer, members of this community often use the [[Koren Siddur]] or ''[[Rinat Yisrael]]''.\n\n== Politics ==\nMost Religious Zionists embrace [[right-wing]] politics, especially the religious right-wing [[Jewish Home]] party, but also support the mainstream right-wing [[Likud]]. There are also some left-wing Religious Zionists, such as Rabbi [[Michael Melchior]], whose views were represented by the [[Meimad]] party (which ran together with the [[Labor (Israel)|Israeli Labor party]]). Many Israeli [[Israeli settlements|settlers]] in the [[West Bank]] are Religious Zionists, along with most of the settlers forcibly expelled from the [[Gaza Strip]] in August and September 2005.\n\n== Military service ==\n{{unreferencedsect|date=November 2015}}\n[[File:IDF soldier put on tefillin.jpg|thumb|Second-Lieutenant [[From the Wilderness and Lebanon|Asael Lubotzky]], an [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] field commander during [[Second Lebanon War]], prays with [[Tefilin]]]]\nAll adult Jewish males in Israel are obligated to serve in the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]]. Certain segments of Orthodoxy defer their service in order to engage in full-time Torah study. Religious Zionist belief advocates that both are critical to Jewish survival and prosperity.\n\nFor this reason, many Religious Zionist men take part in the [[Hesder]] program, which allows military service to be combined with [[yeshiva]] studies. Some others attend a pre-army [[Mechina]] educational program, delaying their service by one year. 88% of Hesder students belong to combat units, compared to a national average of below 30%. \n\nWhile some Religious Zionist women serve in the army, most choose national service, known as [[Sherut Leumi]], instead (working at hospitals, schools, and day-care centers).\nIn November 2010, the IDF held a special conference which was attended by the heads of Religious Zionism in order to encourage female Religious Zionists to join the IDF. The IDF undertook that all modesty and kosher issues will be handled in order to make female Religious Zionists comfortable.\n\n== Notable figures ==\n* [[Yehuda Amital]]\n* [[Eli Sadan]] \n* [[Shlomo Aviner]]\n* [[Naftali Bennett]]\n* [[Yosef Burg]]\n* [[She'ar Yashuv Cohen]]\n* [[Haim Druckman]]\n* [[Effi Eitam]]\n* [[Mordechai Eliyahu]]\n* [[Moshe Feiglin]]\n* [[Shlomo Goren]]\n* [[Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog]]\n* [[Meir Kahane]]\n* [[Binyamin Ze'ev Kahane]]\n* [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]]\n* [[Avraham Yitzchak Kook]]\n* [[Zvi Yehuda Kook]]\n* [[Dov Lior]]\n* [[Rafi Peretz]]\n* [[Zevulun Orlev]]\n* [[Shlomo Riskin]]\n* [[Avraham Shapira]]\n* [[Shaul Yisraeli]]\n* [[Oury Amos Cherki]]\n* [[Bezalel Smotrich]]\n* [[Baruch Marzel]]\n* [[Michael Ben-Ari]]\n* [[Baruch Goldstein]]\n* [[Yisrael Ariel]]\n* [[Yehuda Glick]]\n* [[Aharon Lichtenstein]]\n* [[Yaakov Ariel]]\n* [[Jonathan Sacks]]\n* [[Hanan Porat]]\n* [[Zvi Thau]]\n* [[Yaaqov Medan]]\n* [[Haim Sabato]]\n* [[Nahum Rabinovitch]]\n* [[Robert Aumann]]\n* [[Uri Orbach]]\n* [[Meir Bar-Ilan]]\n* [[Shimon Gershon Rosenberg]]\n* [[Joseph B.

[https://mosaicmagazine.com/response/politics-current-affairs/2020/01/what-unites-people-of-faith-across-religions-and-divides-them-from-others/ \"What Unites People of Faith across Religions, and Divides Them from Others.\"] ''Mosaic''.  23 January 2020.  23 January 2020.</ref> To generations of [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora Jews]], [[Jerusalem]] has been a symbol of the [[Holy Land]] and of their return to it, as promised by God in numerous [[Bible|Biblical prophecies]]. Despite this, many Jews did not embrace Zionism before the 1930s, and certain religious groups opposed it then, as some groups still do now, on the grounds that an attempt to re-establish Jewish rule in Israel by [[human agency]] was blasphemous. Hastening salvation and the coming of the Messiah was considered religiously forbidden, and Zionism was seen as a sign of disbelief in God's power, and therefore, a rebellion against God. Rabbi Kook developed a [[theology|theological]] answer to that claim, which gave Zionism a religious legitimation: \"Zionism was not merely a political movement by secular Jews. It was actually a tool of [[God]] to promote His divine scheme, and to initiate the return of the Jews to their homeland \u2013 the land He promised to [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]]. God wants the [[children of Israel]] to return to their home in order to establish a Jewish sovereign state in which Jews could live according to the laws of [[Torah]] and [[Halakha]], and commit the [[Mitzvah|Mitzvot]] of Eretz Israel (these are religious commandments which can be performed only in the [[Land of Israel]]). Moreover, to cultivate the Land of Israel was a Mitzvah by itself, and it should be carried out. Therefore, settling [[Eretz Israel|Israel]] is an obligation of the religious Jews, and helping Zionism is actually following God's will.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Torat Eretz Yisrael|first=David|last=Samson|author2=Tzvi Fishman |publisher=Torat Eretz Yisrael Publications|location=Jerusalem |year=1991}}</ref>\n\nReligious Jews also disapproved of the Zionists because many were secular Jews or [[atheist]]s, taking their cue from [[Marxism]]. [[Labour Zionism|Socialist Zionism]] envisaged the movement as a tool for building an advanced [[socialist]] society in the land of Israel, while solving the problem of [[antisemitism]]. The early [[kibbutz]] was a communal settlement that focused on national goals, unencumbered by religion and precepts of Jewish law such as [[kashrut]]. Socialist Zionists were one of the results of a long process of modernization within the Jewish communities of Europe, known as the [[Haskalah]], or Jewish Enlightenment. Rabbi Kook's answer was as follows:\n\n:''Secular Zionists may think they do it for political, national, or socialist reasons, but in fact \u2013 the actual reason for them coming to resettle in [[Eretz Israel|Israel]] is a religious Jewish spark (\"Nitzotz\") in their [[soul]], planted by God. Without their knowledge, they are contributing to the divine scheme and actually committing a great [[Mitzvah]].''\n\n:''The role of religious Zionists is to help them to establish a Jewish state and turn the religious spark in them into a great light. They should show them that the real source of Zionism and the longed-for Zion is [[Judaism]] and teach them [[Torah]] with love and kindness. In the end, they will understand that the laws of [[Torah]] are the key to true [[harmony]] and a [[socialist]] state (not in the [[Marxist]] [[Socialist mode of production|meaning]]) that will be a light for the [[goyim|nations]] and bring salvation to the world.''\n\n[[Shlomo Avineri]] explained the last part of Kook's answer: \"... and the end of those pioneers, who scout into the blindness of secularism and atheism, but the treasured light inside them leads them into the path of salvation \u2013 their end is that from doing Mitzva without purpose, they will do Mitzva with a purpose.\" (page 222, <sup>[[Religious Zionist Movement#References|1]]</sup>)\n\n== Organizations ==\n[[File:Bnei akiva logo.jpg|thumb|100px|left|[[Bnei Akiva]] youth movement, combining Torah and work]]\n\nThe first rabbis to support Zionism were [[Judah Alkalai|Yehuda Shlomo Alkalai]] and [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]]. They argued that the change in the status of [[Western Europe]]'s Jews following [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation]] was the first step toward redemption (\u05d2\u05d0\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4), and that, therefore, one must hasten the messianic salvation by a natural salvation \u2013 whose main pillars are the [[Kibbutz Galuyot]] (\"Gathering of the Exiles\"), the return to Eretz Israel, agricultural work (\u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05ea \u05d0\u05d3\u05de\u05d4), and the revival of the everyday use of the [[Hebrew language]].\n\nThe [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]] organization was established in 1902 in [[Vilna]] at a world conference of Religious Zionists. It operates a [[Zionist youth movement|youth movement]], [[Bnei Akiva]], which was founded in 1929. Mizrachi believes that the [[Torah]] should be at the centre of [[Zionism]], a sentiment expressed in the Mizrachi Zionist slogan ''Am Yisrael B'Eretz Yisrael al pi Torat Yisrael'' (\"The people of Israel in the land of Israel according to the Torah of Israel\"). It also sees Jewish nationalism as a tool for achieving religious objectives. Mizrachi was the first official Religious Zionist party. It also built a network of religious schools that exist to this day.\n\nIn 1937-1948, the [[Religious Kibbutz Movement]] established three settlement blocs of three kibbutzim each. The first was in the [[Beit Shean]] Valley, the second was in the [[Hebron]] mountains south of [[Bethlehem]] (known as [[Gush Etzion]]), and the third was in the western [[Negev]]. Kibbutz [[Yavne]] was founded in the center of the country as the core of a fourth bloc that came into being after the establishment of the state.<ref>\"Settlement clustering on a socio-cultural basis: The bloc settlement policy of the Religious Kibbutz Movement in Palestine,\" Yossi Katz, ''Journal of Rural Studies'', vol. 11, no. 2, pp. 161\u2013171, 1995</ref>\n\n== Political parties ==\nThe [[Labor Movement]] wing of Religious Zionism, founded in 1921 under the Zionist slogan \"Torah va'Avodah\" (Torah and Labor), was called [[Hapoel HaMizrachi]]. It represented religiously traditional [[Labour Zionism|Labour Zionists]], both in Europe and in the Land of Israel, where it represented religious Jews in the [[Histadrut]]. In 1956, Mizrachi, Hapoel HaMizrachi, and other religious Zionists formed the [[National Religious Party]] to advance the rights of religious Zionist Jews in Israel. Other parties and groups affiliated with religious Zionism are [[Gush Emunim]], [[Tkuma (political party)|Tkuma]], and [[Meimad]]. [[Kahanism]], a radical branch of religious Zionism, was founded by Rabbi [[Meir Kahane]], whose party, [[Kach and Kahane Chai|Kach]], was eventually banned for [[racism]]. Today, [[Otzma Yehudit]] is the leading wing of this school of thought.\n\n== Educational institutions ==\n:''See: [[Yeshiva #Israel]]; [[:Category:Religious Zionist yeshivot]]; [[List of Midrashot]].''\n[[File:Mercaz HaRav01.JPG|thumb|[[Mercaz Harav]], Jerusalem]]\nThe flagship religious institution of the Religious Zionist movement is the [[yeshiva]] founded by Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook in 1924, called in his honor \"[[Mercaz haRav]]\" (lit., the Rabbi's center). \nOther Religious Zionist yeshivot include [[Ateret Cohanim]], [[Beit El yeshiva]] and Yeshivat [[Or Etzion]], founded by Rav [[Haim Druckman]], a foremost disciple of Rabbi [[Tzvi Yehuda Kook]].\n\nThere are also approximately 90 ''[[Hesder]]'' yeshivot, allowing students to continue [[Torah study]] during their National Service (see [[#Military_service|below]]).\nThe first was [[Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh]], established in 1954; the largest is the [[Hesder Yeshiva of Sderot]] with over 800 students.\nOthers well known include [[Machon Meir|Yeshivat Machon Meir]], [[Yeshivat Har Etzion]], [[Yeshivat HaKotel]], [[Yeshivat Birkat Moshe]] in [[Maale Adumim]], [[Yeshiva Har Bracha|Yeshivat Har Bracha]] and Yeshivat Har Hamor.  \n\nThese institutions usually offer a [[kollel]] for ''[[Semikha]]'', or Rabbinic ordination. Students generally prepare for the ''Semikha'' test of the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]]; often for that of the [[posek]] R. [[Zalman Nechemia Goldberg]].\nTraining as a [[Dayan (rabbinic judge)]] in this community is usually through [[:he:\u05de\u05db\u05d5\u05df \u05d0\u05e8\u05d9\u05d0\u05dc|''Machon Ariel'']] (''[[Machon Harry Fischel]]''), also founded by Rav Kook, or [[:he:\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5_\u05d7\u05de\u05d3\u05d4_(\u05db\u05d5\u05dc\u05dc) |''Kollel Eretz Hemda'']].\n\nWomen study in institutions known as ''Midrashot'' (sing. [[Midrasha]]) - examples are [[Ein_HaNetziv#Education|Ein HaNatziv Women's Seminary]] and [[Migdal Oz (seminary)|Migdal Oz]]. Some also offer degree studies (and may then be known as a ''machon'').\n[[Nishmat (midrasha)|Nishmat]] trains women as [[Yoetzet Halacha|Yoatzot Halacha]]; see also [[Midreshet Lindenbaum]] and [[Matan Women's Institute for Torah Studies|Matan]], which similarly offer Talmud focused learning to women.\n\nHigh school students study at [[Education_in_Israel#Educational_tracks|''Mamlachti dati'']] schools, often associated with ''[[Bnei Akiva]]''. The first of these was at [[Kfar Haroeh]] established by [[Moshe-Zvi Neria]].\nFor degree studies, many attend [[Bar Ilan University]], which allows students to combine Yeshiva studies with university study; \n[[Jerusalem College of Technology]] similarly (which also offers a Haredi track).\nThere are also [[List_of_Israeli_universities_and_colleges#Colleges|several colleges of education]] associated with Hesder and the ''Midrashot'', such as [[Herzog College]] and the [[Lifshitz College of Education]]. These often allow specializations in [[Tanach]] and ''Machshava'' ([[Jewish thought]]).\n\n== Dress ==\nReligious Zionists are often called ''Kippot sruggot'', referring to the knitted or crocheted [[kippot|skullcaps]] (Hebrew ''kippa'', pl. ''kippot'') worn by many of the men. However, there are also men who wear other types of headcoverings, such as ''kippot'' in black velvet.\n\n== Politics ==\nMost Religious Zionists embrace [[right-wing]] politics, especially the religious right-wing [[Jewish Home]] party, but also support the mainstream right-wing [[Likud]]. There are also some left-wing Religious Zionists, such as Rabbi [[Michael Melchior]], whose views were represented by the [[Meimad]] party (which ran together with the [[Labor (Israel)|Israeli Labor party]]). Many Israeli [[Israeli settlements|settlers]] in the [[West Bank]] are Religious Zionists, along with most of the settlers forcibly expelled from the [[Gaza Strip]] in August and September 2005.\n\n== Military service ==\n{{unreferencedsect|date=November 2015}}\n[[File:IDF soldier put on tefillin.jpg|thumb|Second-Lieutenant [[From the Wilderness and Lebanon|Asael Lubotzky]], an [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] field commander during [[Second Lebanon War]], prays with [[Tefilin]]]]\nAll adult Jewish males in Israel are obligated to serve in the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]]. Certain segments of Orthodoxy defer their service in order to engage in full-time Torah study. Religious Zionist belief advocates that both are critical to Jewish survival and prosperity.\n\nFor this reason, many Religious Zionist men take part in the [[Hesder]] program, which allows military service to be combined with [[yeshiva]] studies. Some others attend a pre-army [[Mechina]] educational program, delaying their service by one year. 88% of Hesder students belong to combat units, compared to a national average of below 30%. \n\nWhile some Religious Zionist women serve in the army, most choose national service, known as [[Sherut Leumi]], instead (working at hospitals, schools, and day-care centers).\nIn November 2010, the IDF held a special conference which was attended by the heads of Religious Zionism in order to encourage female Religious Zionists to join the IDF. The IDF undertook that all modesty and kosher issues will be handled in order to make female Religious Zionists comfortable.\n\n== Notable figures ==\n* [[Yehuda Amital]]\n* [[Eli Sadan]] \n* [[Shlomo Aviner]]\n* [[Naftali Bennett]]\n* [[Yosef Burg]]\n* [[She'ar Yashuv Cohen]]\n* [[Haim Druckman]]\n* [[Effi Eitam]]\n* [[Mordechai Eliyahu]]\n* [[Moshe Feiglin]]\n* [[Shlomo Goren]]\n* [[Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog]]\n* [[Meir Kahane]]\n* [[Binyamin Ze'ev Kahane]]\n* [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]]\n* [[Avraham Yitzchak Kook]]\n* [[Zvi Yehuda Kook]]\n* [[Dov Lior]]\n* [[Rafi Peretz]]\n* [[Zevulun Orlev]]\n* [[Shlomo Riskin]]\n* [[Avraham Shapira]]\n* [[Shaul Yisraeli]]\n* [[Oury Amos Cherki]]\n* [[Bezalel Smotrich]]\n* [[Baruch Marzel]]\n* [[Michael Ben-Ari]]\n* [[Baruch Goldstein]]\n* [[Yisrael Ariel]]\n* [[Yehuda Glick]]\n* [[Aharon Lichtenstein]]\n* [[Yaakov Ariel]]\n* [[Jonathan Sacks]]\n* [[Hanan Porat]]\n* [[Zvi Thau]]\n* [[Yaaqov Medan]]\n* [[Haim Sabato]]\n* [[Nahum Rabinovitch]]\n* [[Robert Aumann]]\n* [[Uri Orbach]]\n* [[Meir Bar-Ilan]]\n* [[Shimon Gershon Rosenberg]]\n* [[Joseph B.

He came to the poor and the battlers\".

The Pope said that AIDS could not be overcome through the distribution of condoms, which \"can even increase the problem\".

One witness said he had gone to \"Pell's presbytery\" in Ballarat to warn him about Dowlan. Pell submitted evidence that he did not live in Ballarat or in that presbytery at the time, and the counsel-assisting noted in her final submission that \"Cardinal Pell's evidence about his living arrangements and duties in 1973 and 1974 make it less likely that he was at St Patrick's presbytery late in the afternoon on a week day.\"<ref name=\"Case Study 28\" />\n\n====March 2014 appearance====\n\nIn 2014, the royal commission was told how lawyers representing Pell and the Archdiocese of Sydney incurred costs of A$1.5&nbsp;million against a victim of child sexual abuse. The lawyers, acting on the church's instructions, \"vigorously\" fought John Ellis through the courts despite warnings of his \"fragile psychological state\". The resulting [[New South Wales Court of Appeal]] ruling established the controversial \"Ellis Defence\", which confirmed that the church could not be sued as a legal entity and held liable for child sexual abuse committed by a priest in such matters.

In relation to the third ground, the court ruled that the requirement for the jury to be present during arraignment did not require physical presence and that presence via video link (as was the case here) was adequate to satisfy this requirement.<ref name=\"VCA dismissal\" />\n\n=== Acquittal ===\nOn 17 September, Pell sought special leave to appeal to the [[High Court of Australia]], the final court of appeal in Australia.<ref>There is no automatic right to appeal to the High Court; special leave is always required.</ref><ref name=\"HCA appeal lodge ABCNews\">{{cite news |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-09-17/george-pell-to-appeal-to-the-high-court/11437796 |title=George Pell seeks leave to appeal child sex abuse convictions in High Court |first=Sarah |last=Farnsworth |work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |date=17 September 2019 |access-date=17 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/choirboy-can-be-believed-and-pell-freed-cardinal-s-lawyers-say-20190920-p52t8f.html|last=Le Grand|first=Chip|title=Choirboy can be believed \u2013 and Pell freed, Cardinal's lawyers say|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=20 September 2019|accessdate=20 September 2019}}</ref> On 13 November, two justices of the High Court referred the decision on leave to appeal to a full court \"for argument as on an appeal\".<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-13/george-pell-appeal-in-high-court-what-happens-next/11700954 |title=Here's what happens now the High Court has agreed to hear George Pell's appeal bid |date=13 November 2019 |work=ABC News |access-date=7 April 2020 |url-status=live |language=en-AU}}</ref><ref name=\"HCA appeal grant\">{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/HCATrans/2019/217.html |title=Pell v The Queen [2019] HCATrans 217 (13&nbsp;November 2019) |website=High Court of Australia Transcripts |date=13 November 2019 |accessdate=13 November 2019}} This decision was made \"on the papers\".

Review after outcome of HCA appeal. -->\nOn the first ground of appeal, that the verdict was unreasonable, the court granted leave to appeal but dismissed the appeal by a majority (2\u20131) decision. Chief Justice Ferguson and Justice Maxwell dismissed the appeal. Ferguson stated that, for the appeal to succeed, the court needed to find that the jury ''must'' have had doubt as to the defendant's guilt, not merely that they ''could'' have had doubt. Justice Weinberg issued a dissenting judgment and would have allowed the appeal on the first ground.<ref name=\"VCA dismissal\" />\n\nWhilst Chief Justice Ferguson and Justice Maxwell stated that they \"did not experience a doubt\" in the case, the dissenting Judge Weinberg likened the case to that of [[Lindy Chamberlain]], which had seen wrongful conviction by a jury and appeal court based on faulty evidence:<ref>[https://www.msn.com/en-au/news/australia/dissenting-judge-used-lindy-chamberlains-case-to-dismiss-guilty-pell-verdict/ar-AAGa8h1 \"Dissenting judge used Lindy Chamberlain's case to dismiss guilty Pell verdict\"], www.msn.com, 22 August 2019.</ref><ref>[https://www.supremecourt.vic.gov.au/case-summaries/court-of-appeal-proceedings/george-pell-v-the-queen \"George Pell v The Queen\"], Victorian Court of Appeal.</ref> Weinberg wrote that \"there is, to my mind, a 'significant possibility' that the applicant in this case may not have committed these offences. That means that, in my respectful opinion, these convictions cannot be permitted to stand. The only order that can properly be made is that the applicant be acquitted on each charge.\"<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/21/he-was-a-witness-of-truth-why-the-judges-decided-cardinal-george-pell-was-guilty \"He was a witness of truth: why the judges decided Cardinal George Pell was guilty\"], ''The Guardian'', 21 August 2019.</ref><ref>[https://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/vic/VSCA//2019/186.html \"Pell v The Queen &#91;2019&#93;\"], VSCA 186, 21 August 2019.</ref>\n\nThe court unanimously refused leave to appeal on the second and third grounds. In relation to the second ground, Chief Justice Ferguson described the visual aid that Pell's lawyer sought to present in his closing address as tendentious, as potentially misleading or confusing and as including material that was unsupported by evidence in the trial record. The court ruled that the trial judge had been correct to exclude it. In relation to the third ground, the court ruled that the requirement for the jury to be present during arraignment did not require physical presence and that presence via video link (as was the case here) was adequate to satisfy this requirement.<ref name=\"VCA dismissal\" />\n\n=== Acquittal ===\nOn 17 September, Pell sought special leave to appeal to the [[High Court of Australia]], the final court of appeal in Australia.<ref>There is no automatic right to appeal to the High Court; special leave is always required.</ref><ref name=\"HCA appeal lodge ABCNews\">{{cite news |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-09-17/george-pell-to-appeal-to-the-high-court/11437796 |title=George Pell seeks leave to appeal child sex abuse convictions in High Court |first=Sarah |last=Farnsworth |work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |date=17 September 2019 |access-date=17 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/choirboy-can-be-believed-and-pell-freed-cardinal-s-lawyers-say-20190920-p52t8f.html|last=Le Grand|first=Chip|title=Choirboy can be believed \u2013 and Pell freed, Cardinal's lawyers say|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=20 September 2019|accessdate=20 September 2019}}</ref> On 13 November, two justices of the High Court referred the decision on leave to appeal to a full court \"for argument as on an appeal\".<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-13/george-pell-appeal-in-high-court-what-happens-next/11700954 |title=Here's what happens now the High Court has agreed to hear George Pell's appeal bid |date=13 November 2019 |work=ABC News |access-date=7 April 2020 |url-status=live |language=en-AU}}</ref><ref name=\"HCA appeal grant\">{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/HCATrans/2019/217.html |title=Pell v The Queen [2019] HCATrans 217 (13&nbsp;November 2019) |website=High Court of Australia Transcripts |date=13 November 2019 |accessdate=13 November 2019}} This decision was made \"on the papers\".
