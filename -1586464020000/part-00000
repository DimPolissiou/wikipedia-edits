exist for its diagnosis, as of October 2019.<ref name=SiegelJatlaoui2019/> Healthcare providers should evaluate for alternative diagnoses (e.g., cardiac, gastrointestinal, rheumatologic, neoplastic, environmental, or occupational exposures, or causes of [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]]) as suggested by clinical presentation and medical history, while also considering multiple etiologies, including the possibility of VAPI occurring with a concomitant infection.<ref name=SiegelJatlaoui2019/>\n\nAll healthcare providers evaluating patients for VAPI should consider obtaining a thorough patient history, including symptoms and recent use of e-cigarette, or vaping, products, along with substances used, duration and frequency of use, and method of use.<ref name=SiegelJatlaoui2019/> Additionally a detailed physical examination should be performed, specifically including vital signs and pulse-[[oximetry]].<ref name=SiegelJatlaoui2019/> Laboratory testing guided by clinical findings, which may include a respiratory virus panel to rule out infectious diseases, [[complete blood count]] with differential, serum inflammatory markers ([[C-reactive protein]] [CRP], [[erythrocyte sedimentation rate]] [ESR]), liver [[transaminase]]s, and urine toxicology testing, including testing for THC should be acquired.<ref name=SiegelJatlaoui2019/> Imaging, typically a chest [[X-ray]], with consideration for a chest CT if chest X-ray results do not correlate with the clinical picture or to evaluate severe or worsening disease should be obtained.<ref name=SiegelJatlaoui2019/> Consulting with specialists (e.g. critical care, pulmonology, medical toxicology, or infectious disease) can help guide further evaluation.<ref name=SiegelJatlaoui2019/> The

the diagnosis of VAPI.<ref name=CDPH-2019/> As of October&nbsp;2019, VAPI<ref name=nomenclature group=lower-alpha/> is considered a [[diagnosis of exclusion]] because no specific tests or markers exist for its diagnosis, as of October 2019.<ref name=SiegelJatlaoui2019/> Healthcare providers should evaluate for alternative diagnoses (e.g., cardiac, gastrointestinal, rheumatologic, neoplastic, environmental, or occupational exposures, or causes of [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]]) as suggested by clinical presentation and medical history, while also considering multiple etiologies, including the possibility of VAPI occurring with a concomitant infection.<ref name=SiegelJatlaoui2019/>\n\nAll healthcare providers evaluating patients for VAPI should consider obtaining a thorough patient history, including symptoms and recent use of e-cigarette, or vaping, products, along with substances used, duration and frequency of use, and method of use.<ref name=SiegelJatlaoui2019/> Additionally a detailed physical examination should be performed, specifically including vital signs and pulse-[[oximetry]].<ref name=SiegelJatlaoui2019/> Laboratory testing guided by clinical findings, which may include a respiratory virus panel to rule out infectious diseases, [[complete blood count]] with differential, serum inflammatory markers ([[C-reactive protein]] [CRP], [[erythrocyte sedimentation rate]] [ESR]), liver [[transaminase]]s, and urine toxicology testing, including testing for THC should be acquired.<ref name=SiegelJatlaoui2019/> Imaging, typically a chest [[X-ray]], with consideration for a chest CT if chest X-ray results do not correlate with the clinical picture or to evaluate severe or worsening disease should be obtained.<ref name=SiegelJatlaoui2019/> Consulting with specialists (e.g. critical care, pulmonology, medical toxicology, or infectious disease) can help guide further evaluation.<ref name=SiegelJatlaoui2019/> The diagnosis is commonly suspected when the person does not respond to antibiotic therapy, and testing does not reveal an alternative diagnosis.<ref name=CDPH-2019/> Many of the reported cases involved worsening respiratory failure within 48&nbsp;hours of admission after the administration of empiric antibiotic therapy.<ref name=DavidsonBrancato2019/> Lung biopsies are not necessary for the

2017|accessdate=February 10, 2018}}</ref> According to [[University of Virginia]] musicologist Karl Hagstrom Miller, Twenty One Pilots is a prime example of how modern bands are evolving from the guitar-bass-drums format, a staple of punk rock, to \"other configurations of musical collaboration.\"<ref name=\"Wilson\"/>\n\nDuring their songs, Joseph incorparates [[rapping]], singing, and sometimes screaming.<ref name=\"Wilson\"/> He utilizes a fast-paced style of reciting poetic lyrics that is a characteristic of rap music.<ref name=\"Sblendorio\"/> Music journalist Carl Wilson has noted that Joseph's style of rapping is often compared to that of [[Macklemore]], yet he wrote \"but among the ranks of post-Eminem white rappers, I find Joseph more probing, sardonic, and expressive.\"<ref name=\"Wilson\"/> However, Joseph doesn't consider himself a rapper.<ref name=\"Booth\"/> Joseph explains that he never intended to be a rapper, and simply finds the art form of rap the most effective way of trying to say something with his music.<ref name=\"Booth\"/> He realized how little the amount of lyrics are in a full song, because they're sung and words are drawn out by melodies.<ref name=\"Booth\"/> When attempting to write poetry he had written for the lyrics of a song, Joseph found there were way too many words to fit.<ref name=\"Booth\"/> He soon found himself just saying the poetry in [[tempo]] and realizing that he was rapping.<ref name=\"Booth\"/> His vocal performance, which sometimes also includes [[Screaming (music)|screaming]] lines, coupled with an earnest, patchy way of delivering [[wordplay]] atop Dun's drum rhythms is part of what allowed the duo to break out of the alternative scene.<ref name=\"Wilson\"/>\n\n===Lyrical themes===\n\nJoseph describes both his songwriting and himself as \"very dramatic.\"<ref name=\"Booth\"/> He writes lyrics that are [[psychodramatic]] in nature and usually based around his piano parts in songs.<ref name=\"Wilson\"/> Joseph is mostly inspired by [[chord progression]] and [[song structure]], and his lyrics come afterwards.<ref name=\"Booth\"/> He usually composes the music first because he has a small studio in his basement. Joseph is able to lay down thoughts musically in terms of chord progression, come up with a [[melody]] and then fit the lyrics into that song.<ref name=\"Booth\"/> Their music inspires song lyrics depending on what is being imparted most of the time. However, Joseph also likes to write poetry so sometimes he'll musically create a song and then fit the poetry.<ref name=\"Booth\"/> \n\nAlongside their mixture of musical styles, the band melds relatable rhymes with [[angst]]y lyrics.<ref name=\"musicfeeds\" /> Lyrically, Twenty One Pilots is conventionally [[post-emo]].<ref name=\"Wilson\"/> They coincide with a contemporary wave of [[emo revival]] fueled in part by [[millennial]] [[nostalgia]] for popular music from the [[2000s in music|early 2000s]].<ref name=\"Wilson\"/> Joseph's [[Confessional poetry|confessional]] lines convey personal turmoils and deeply rooted insecurities.<ref name=\"musicfeeds\"/> Their songs contain moments where personal despair connect to a universal context, often relating to that of faith, location or community. Thus making the band more accessible than other more insular [[emo]]-inspired artists.<ref name=\"Wilson\"/> Having been raised in Christian households, the lyrics of their songs rarely engage in profanity and [[shock value]]. The duo still identify as  Christians, and a significant portion of their fanbase interpret lyrics from their songs as an ongoing negotiation with [[God]]. From a more secular perspective, their words center on [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and [[anxiety]], with habitual direct reference to self-harm.<ref name=\"Wilson\"/> \n\nThe lyrical themes most prevalent on the band's major-label debut album ''[[Vessel (Twenty One Pilots album)|Vessel]]'' were introspection and fear.<ref name=\"Booth\"/> Joseph wrote from a very introspective perspective, offering an inside view of what he was going through at the time. He feels that music is a catalyst to getting your emotions going. While he acknowledges many who write songs about [[love]] do so because its widely believed love is the most powerful emotion there is, he disagrees with the sentiment. Joseph instead thinks the emotion of [[fear]] is equally as powerful, if not slightly more so. As a result, much of ''Vessel'' pertained to the power of fear as well as dealing with and trying to find hope, peace and redemption at the end of and inside of fear.<ref name=\"Booth\"/> Their next studio album, ''Blurryface'' was much like a [[concept album]] in that it was shaped by intimate themes regarding personal issues such as insecurity.<ref name=\"musicfeeds\"/> Due primarily to the [[childhood]] yearnings of their breakout single \"[[Stressed Out]]\", Twenty One Pilots have become emblematic of angst-ridden millennial entitlement.<ref name=\"Wilson\"/> The loose concept album is about Joseph attempting to defeat the [[alter ego]] of the titular monster-image representing his insecurities and self-hatreds.<ref name=\"Wilson\"/>\n\n== Band name, iconography, and fandom ==\nAccording to the band, their purpose for making music is \"to make people think\" and encourage them to find joy in what they come to believe in life.<ref name=\"About\" /> Twenty One Pilots derives their band name and philosophy from literary origins.<ref name=\"Lopez\">{{cite web|author=Lopez, Korina |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2014/02/10/studioa-video-meet-indie-rockers-twenty-one-pilots-930-club/5377971/|title=StudioA: Meet Indie Rockers Twenty One Pilots|work=[[USA Today]]|date=February 10, 2014|accessdate=February 10, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"BigNew\"/> \"Bicycle Thief\" and \"Chill Coat\" were among some of the rejected band names.<ref>{{cite web|title=Founding Twenty One Pilots member Chris Salih opens up about band|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/entry/twenty_one_pilots_chris_salih_interview_stream|website=Alternative Press|accessdate=October 29, 2017}}</ref> This goes back to college days, according to Joseph, when he was studying [[theater]] at [[Ohio State University]].<ref name=\"Campbell\">[http://woub.org/2012/03/14/interview-twenty-one-pilots Interview: Twenty One Pilots] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020073108/http://woub.org/2012/03/14/interview-twenty-one-pilots |date=October 20, 2014 }}; WOUB, March 14, 2012</ref> He got the band's name and meaning from reading the 1947 play [[All My Sons]] by American playwright [[Arthur Miller]].<ref name=\"Campbell\"/><ref name=\"Lopez\"/> In the story, the main protagonist is a war contractor named Joe Keller who crafts airplane parts for war planes.<ref name=\"BigNew\"/><ref name=\"Campbell\"/> Upon discovering some are faulty and would fail if used, he must decide whether to or not recall them.<ref name=\"Campbell\"/><ref name=\"Lopez\"/> Keller is forced to make a decision to either spend his money trying to repair the faulty parts or press forward and use them.<ref name=\"Campbell\"/> Though he wants to do what's right, Keller is afraid to lose money and needs to support his family, so he decides to send the parts anyway, to Europe during [[World War II]].<ref name=\"Lopez\"/><ref name=\"BigNew\"/> As a consequence towards his decision, twenty-one pilots perish.

Eshleman, a longtime friend of and creative director for Twenty One Pilots, created the band's logo by \"messing around with shapes\". Joseph found that the arrangement resonated with him.<ref name=\"Episode 09 - Chris Salih\">{{cite web|title=Episode 09 - Chris Salih|url=https://soundcloud.com/21pilotspodcast|website=The Twenty One Pilots Podcast on SoundCloud}}</ref> Regarding their logo, Joseph stated in an interview that:\n{{cquote|It means Twenty One Pilots, the logo does. Why it means Twenty One Pilots, is it really goes along with one of our songs called \"Kitchen Sink\". The whole concept of that song is that I feel that humans are always struggling all the time when it comes to purpose, trying to figure out what their purpose is, what purpose even is, what's the point, justifying your own existence. A lot of kids and people my age struggle with \"what's the point\", and with the logo, what it really means is it's an encouragement. When someone asks me what the logo means to me, the logo means something to me because I made it mean something to me. That's the point. The point is that I created something that only I understand and whether or not I decide to disclose the meaning of it, that's the beginning of purpose for me. The meaning of purpose for me, is by creating something, if it be by writing lyrics, painting a picture, by expressing yourself through art if it's photography or music or theater, or whatever it is. It doesn't have to be artistic, but if you create something and only you know the meaning of it, that's the beginning of purpose for you. When you're in the room by yourself trying to decide whether to stay alive, you can tell yourself \"I should probably stay alive because I'm the only one who knows the meaning of that thing\", so the logo is an encouragement for people to create.

Joseph explained that, \"If you were to look at those two logos that we had done in the past, and put it together, it would create a logo that is two upward slashes and two sideways slashes.

The band was formed in 2009 by lead vocalist [[Tyler Joseph]] along with Nick Thomas and Chris Salih, both of whom left in 2011. Since their departure, the line-up has consisted of Joseph and drummer [[Josh Dun]]. The duo is best known for the singles \"[[Stressed Out]]\", \"[[Ride (Twenty One Pilots song)|Ride]]\", and \"[[Heathens (song)|Heathens]]\". The group received a [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance]] at the [[59th Annual Grammy Awards]] for \"Stressed Out\".\n\nThe band independently released two albums, ''[[Twenty One Pilots (album)|Twenty One Pilots]]'' (2009) and ''Regional at Best'' (2011), before being signed by record label [[Fueled by Ramen]] in 2012. Their label debut, ''[[Vessel (Twenty One Pilots album)|Vessel]]'', was released in 2013. The duo achieved breakthrough success with their fourth album, ''[[Blurryface]]'' (2015), which produced the successful singles \"Stressed Out\" and \"Ride\" and became the first album in history on which every track received at least a gold [[Music recording sales certification|certification]] from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/8223671/twenty-one-pilots-blurryface-every-song-riaa-gold|title=Twenty One Pilots' 'Blurryface' Becomes First Album With Every Song RIAA-Certified Gold|last=Payne|first=Chris|date=March 1, 2018|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=March 1, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.riaa.com/twenty-one-pilots-blurryface-earns-unrivaled-gold-platinum-achievement-first-album-digital-era-every-song-riaa-certified/|title=Twenty One Pilots' 'Blurryface' Earns Unrivaled Gold & Platinum Achievement: First Album In Digital Era With Every Song RIAA Certified|date=March 1, 2018|work=[[Recording Industry Association of America]]|accessdate=March 1, 2018}}</ref> The release of the single \"Heathens\" also made the group the first alternative artist to have two concurrent top ten singles in the United States.

2017|accessdate=February 10, 2018}}</ref> According to [[University of Virginia]] musicologist Karl Hagstrom Miller, Twenty One Pilots is a prime example of how modern bands are evolving from the guitar-bass-drums format, a staple of punk rock, to \"other configurations of musical collaboration.\"<ref name=\"Wilson\"/>\n\nDuring their songs, Joseph incorparates [[rapping]], singing, and sometimes screaming.<ref name=\"Wilson\"/> He utilizes a fast-paced style of reciting poetic lyrics that is a characteristic of rap music.<ref name=\"Sblendorio\"/> Music journalist Carl Wilson has noted that Joseph's style of rapping is often compared to that of [[Macklemore]], yet he wrote \"but among the ranks of post-Eminem white rappers, I find Joseph more probing, sardonic, and expressive.\"<ref name=\"Wilson\"/> However, Joseph doesn't consider himself a rapper.<ref name=\"Booth\"/> Joseph explains that he never intended to be a rapper, and simply finds the art form of rap the most effective way of trying to say something with his music.<ref name=\"Booth\"/> He realized how little the amount of lyrics are in a full song, because they're sung and words are drawn out by melodies.<ref name=\"Booth\"/> When attempting to write poetry he had written for the lyrics of a song, Joseph found there were way too many words to fit.<ref name=\"Booth\"/> He soon found himself just saying the poetry in [[tempo]] and realizing that he was rapping.<ref name=\"Booth\"/> His vocal performance, which sometimes also includes [[Screaming (music)|screaming]] lines, coupled with an earnest, patchy way of delivering [[wordplay]] atop Dun's drum rhythms is part of what allowed the duo to break out of the alternative scene.<ref name=\"Wilson\"/>\n\n===Lyrical themes===\n\nJoseph describes both his songwriting and himself as \"very dramatic.\"<ref name=\"Booth\"/> He writes lyrics that are [[psychodramatic]] in nature and usually based around his piano parts in songs.<ref name=\"Wilson\"/> Joseph is mostly inspired by [[chord progression]] and [[song structure]], and his lyrics come afterwards.<ref name=\"Booth\"/> He usually composes the music first because he has a small studio in his basement. Joseph is able to lay down thoughts musically in terms of chord progression, come up with a [[melody]] and then fit the lyrics into that song.<ref name=\"Booth\"/> Their music inspires song lyrics depending on what is being imparted most of the time. However, Joseph also likes to write poetry so sometimes he'll musically create a song and then fit the poetry.<ref name=\"Booth\"/> \n\nAlongside their mixture of musical styles, the band melds relatable rhymes with [[angst]]y lyrics.<ref name=\"musicfeeds\" /> Lyrically, Twenty One Pilots is conventionally [[post-emo]].<ref name=\"Wilson\"/> They coincide with a contemporary wave of [[emo revival]] fueled in part by [[millennial]] [[nostalgia]] for popular music from the [[2000s in music|early 2000s]].<ref name=\"Wilson\"/> Joseph's [[Confessional poetry|confessional]] lines convey personal turmoils and deeply rooted insecurities.<ref name=\"musicfeeds\"/> Their songs contain moments where personal despair connect to a universal context, often relating to that of faith, location or community. Thus making the band more accessible than other more insular [[emo]]-inspired artists.<ref name=\"Wilson\"/> Having been raised in Christian households, the lyrics of their songs rarely engage in profanity and [[shock value]]. The duo still identify as  Christians, and a significant portion of their fanbase interpret lyrics from their songs as an ongoing negotiation with [[God]]. From a more secular perspective, their words center on [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and [[anxiety]], with habitual direct reference to self-harm.<ref name=\"Wilson\"/> \n\nThe lyrical themes most prevalent on the band's major-label debut album ''[[Vessel (Twenty One Pilots album)|Vessel]]'' were introspection and fear.<ref name=\"Booth\"/> Joseph wrote from a very introspective perspective, offering an inside view of what he was going through at the time. He feels that music is a catalyst to getting your emotions going. While he acknowledges many who write songs about [[love]] do so because its widely believed love is the most powerful emotion there is, he disagrees with the sentiment. Joseph instead thinks the emotion of [[fear]] is equally as powerful, if not slightly more so. As a result, much of ''Vessel'' pertained to the power of fear as well as dealing with and trying to find hope, peace and redemption at the end of and inside of fear.<ref name=\"Booth\"/> Their next studio album, ''Blurryface'' was much like a [[concept album]] in that it was shaped by intimate themes regarding personal issues such as insecurity.<ref name=\"musicfeeds\"/> Due primarily to the [[childhood]] yearnings of their breakout single \"[[Stressed Out]]\", Twenty One Pilots have become emblematic of angst-ridden millennial entitlement.<ref name=\"Wilson\"/> The loose concept album is about Joseph attempting to defeat the [[alter ego]] of the titular monster-image representing his insecurities and self-hatreds.<ref name=\"Wilson\"/>\n\n== Band name, iconography, and fandom ==\nAccording to the band, their purpose for making music is \"to make people think\" and encourage them to find joy in what they come to believe in life.<ref name=\"About\" /> Twenty One Pilots derives their band name and philosophy from literary origins.<ref name=\"Lopez\">{{cite web|author=Lopez, Korina |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2014/02/10/studioa-video-meet-indie-rockers-twenty-one-pilots-930-club/5377971/|title=StudioA: Meet Indie Rockers Twenty One Pilots|work=[[USA Today]]|date=February 10, 2014|accessdate=February 10, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"BigNew\"/> \"Bicycle Thief\" and \"Chill Coat\" were among some of the rejected band names.<ref>{{cite web|title=Founding Twenty One Pilots member Chris Salih opens up about band|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/entry/twenty_one_pilots_chris_salih_interview_stream|website=Alternative Press|accessdate=October 29, 2017}}</ref> This goes back to college days, according to Joseph, when he was studying [[theater]] at [[Ohio State University]].<ref name=\"Campbell\">[http://woub.org/2012/03/14/interview-twenty-one-pilots Interview: Twenty One Pilots] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020073108/http://woub.org/2012/03/14/interview-twenty-one-pilots |date=October 20, 2014 }}; WOUB, March 14, 2012</ref> He got the band's name and meaning from reading the 1947 play [[All My Sons]] by American playwright [[Arthur Miller]].<ref name=\"Campbell\"/><ref name=\"Lopez\"/> In the story, the main protagonist is a war contractor named Joe Keller who crafts airplane parts for war planes.<ref name=\"BigNew\"/><ref name=\"Campbell\"/> Upon discovering some are faulty and would fail if used, he must decide whether to or not recall them.<ref name=\"Campbell\"/><ref name=\"Lopez\"/> Keller is forced to make a decision to either spend his money trying to repair the faulty parts or press forward and use them.<ref name=\"Campbell\"/> Though he wants to do what's right, Keller is afraid to lose money and needs to support his family, so he decides to send the parts anyway, to Europe during [[World War II]].<ref name=\"Lopez\"/><ref name=\"BigNew\"/> As a consequence towards his decision, twenty-one pilots perish.

Why it means Twenty One Pilots, is it really goes along with one of our songs called \"Kitchen Sink\". The whole concept of that song is that I feel that humans are always struggling all the time when it comes to purpose, trying to figure out what their purpose is, what purpose even is, what's the point, justifying your own existence. A lot of kids and people my age struggle with \"what's the point\", and with the logo, what it really means is it's an encouragement. When someone asks me what the logo means to me, the logo means something to me because I made it mean something to me. That's the point. The point is that I created something that only I understand and whether or not I decide to disclose the meaning of it, that's the beginning of purpose for me. The meaning of purpose for me, is by creating something, if it be by writing lyrics, painting a picture, by expressing yourself through art if it's photography or music or theater, or whatever it is. It doesn't have to be artistic, but if you create something and only you know the meaning of it, that's the beginning of purpose for you. When you're in the room by yourself trying to decide whether to stay alive, you can tell yourself \"I should probably stay alive because I'm the only one who knows the meaning of that thing\", so the logo is an encouragement for people to create.

Joseph explained that, \"If you were to look at those two logos that we had done in the past, and put it together, it would create a logo that is two upward slashes and two sideways slashes. It's kind of a continuation of what we've been working on.\" He further explained that the extra slashes represent \"the feeling of being surrounded by something that's protecting you...

The insurance is administered by the federal employment agency and funded by employee and employer contributions. This in stark contrast to FUTA in the US and other systems; where only employers make contributions. Participation (and thus contributions) are generally mandatory for both employee and employer. All workers with a regular employment contract, except freelancers and certain civil servants, contribute to the system. Since 2006, certain previously excluded workers have been able to opt into the system on a voluntary basis.\n\nThe system is financed by contributions from employees and employers. Employees pay 1.5% of their gross salary below the social security threshold and employers pay 1.5% contribution on top of the salary paid to the employee. The contribution level was reduced from 3.25% for employees and employers as part of labour market reforms known as Hartz. Contributions are paid only on earnings up to the social security ceiling (2012: 5,600 EUR). The system is largely self-financed but also receives a subsidy from the state to run the Job centers.\n\nUnemployed workers are entitled to:\n* Living allowance known as unemployment benefit\n* Help in finding work\n* Training\n\nUnemployed benefit is paid to workers who have contributed at least during 12 months preceding their loss of a job.

It is viewed as a public problem shared by multiple roles of the society: parents, regional and local governments, non-profit organizations (usually churches) etc. Germany offers a wide range of child care programs for parents: [[Day care|day care centers]] (Krippe) for children up to age 3,  preschool programs ([[Kindergarten]]) for children from age 3 to 6, primary schools (Hort) for school-age children. Around ninety-eight per cent of German daycare is [[Nonprofit organization|non-for-profit]] and is heavily funded by the government. Ninety per cent of the costs are paid by state, regional and local governments through public taxes while the rest of the cost is paid by the parents.<ref>{{Cite book|jstor=10.3138/9781442672178.10|title=Canadian Family Policies|date=1995|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=9780802077868|editor-last=BAKER|editor-first=MAUREEN|series=Cross-National Comparisons|pages=189\u2013235|last1=Baker|first1=Maureen|chapter=Child care delivery and support}}</ref> In western Germany, regulations of day care are enforced by state youth office (Landesjugendamt) in each Land, which distributes funds to day care centers according to a certain amount. Even though the enforcement is in a relatively decentralized form, there is still high conformity on regulatory requirements of the day care centers among different Land. For example, child/staff ratios vary from 17/1 to 25/1; group sizes of 25 in kindergartens; and training requirements for teachers. German child care system values highly of the quality of teaching staffs. In every German Land, a teacher must complete four to five years of training requirements, usually composed of one to two years of [[Prakticum|praktikum]], two years of college, and one year of additional praktikum (berufspraktikum).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gormley|first=William T.|last2=Peters|first2=B.

And the high barrier to enter the market set by the government becomes one of the hinders.\n\nAlthough general condition of the child care system can be applied to most of the cases and regions in Germany, there are noticeably big regional differences, especially between west and east Germany. The regional variations in child care supply reflect the fact that regulations are being made at the local community level. According to Tietze, Rossbach & Roitsch survey in 1994, there are variations in the supply of day care services between rural and urban areas, with rural areas being at a disadvantage. In east Germany, there are much larger number of day care slots than in west Germany and higher rate of child care provision, as an inheritance from its former socialist [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]]. The opening hours of the day-care centers vary as well. In west Germany the opening hours of Kindergarten are short, only for half of the day; while in east Germany 97% of the kindergarten offers all-day care including lunch.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kreyenfeld|first=Michaela|last2=Hank|first2=Karsten|date=2000|title=Does the Availability of Child Care Influence the Employment of Mothers?

Even for women who have jobs, they usually stop working at the birth of the child because mothers are seen as the best child care providers. 3-year period of [[parental leave]] is provided by the government, with low cash benefits paid under the terms of health insurance.

As high as 85 per cent of adult women, including those with young kids, participate in labor market. For working mothers, there are several informal child care arrangements they could have. Usually they have their children to be cared for by grandparents or other close relatives. Others send their kids to day care centers. 60% of east German children under age 3 are cared for by the day centers and over 90% of children aged 3 to 6 attend full-day preschool program.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kamerman|first=Sheila B.|last2=Kahn|first2=Alfred J.|date=1979|title=Comparative analysis in family policy: a case study|jstor=23713548|journal=Social Work|volume=24|issue=6|pages=506\u2013512|doi=10.1093/sw/24.6.506}}</ref>\n\nApart from maternity leave, parents are also entitled to a paid leave if their children are ill at home.\n\n==Funding==\nThe social security system in Germany is funded through contributions paid by employees and employers.

The insurance is administered by the federal employment agency and funded by employee and employer contributions. This in stark contrast to FUTA in the US and other systems; where only employers make contributions. Participation (and thus contributions) are generally mandatory for both employee and employer. All workers with a regular employment contract, except freelancers and certain civil servants, contribute to the system. Since 2006, certain previously excluded workers have been able to opt into the system on a voluntary basis.\n\nThe system is financed by contributions from employees and employers. Employees pay 1.5% of their gross salary below the social security threshold and employers pay 1.5% contribution on top of the salary paid to the employee. The contribution level was reduced from 3.25% for employees and employers as part of labour market reforms known as Hartz. Contributions are paid only on earnings up to the social security ceiling (2012: 5,600 EUR). The system is largely self-financed but also receives a subsidy from the state to run the Job centers.\n\nUnemployed workers are entitled to:\n* Living allowance known as unemployment benefit\n* Help in finding work\n* Training\n\nUnemployed benefit is paid to workers who have contributed at least during 12 months preceding their loss of a job. The allowance is paid for half of the period that the worker has contributed. Claimants get 60% of their previous net salary (capped at the social security ceiling), or 67% for claimants with children. The maximum benefit is therefore 2,964 euros (in 2012).\n\n=== Unemployment benefit II ===\nIf a worker is not eligible for the full unemployment benefits or after receiving the full unemployment benefit for the maximum of 12 months, he is able to apply for benefits from the so-called Hartz IV programme, an open-ended welfare programme.

It is viewed as a public problem shared by multiple roles of the society: parents, regional and local governments, non-profit organizations (usually churches) etc. Germany offers a wide range of child care programs for parents: [[Day care|day care centers]] (Krippe) for children up to age 3,  preschool programs ([[Kindergarten]]) for children from age 3 to 6, primary schools (Hort) for school-age children. Around ninety-eight per cent of German daycare is [[Nonprofit organization|non-for-profit]] and is heavily funded by the government. Ninety per cent of the costs are paid by state, regional and local governments through public taxes while the rest of the cost is paid by the parents.<ref>{{Cite book|jstor=10.3138/9781442672178.10|title=Canadian Family Policies|date=1995|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=9780802077868|editor-last=BAKER|editor-first=MAUREEN|series=Cross-National Comparisons|pages=189\u2013235|last1=Baker|first1=Maureen|chapter=Child care delivery and support}}</ref> In western Germany, regulations of day care are enforced by state youth office (Landesjugendamt) in each Land, which distributes funds to day care centers according to a certain amount. Even though the enforcement is in a relatively decentralized form, there is still high conformity on regulatory requirements of the day care centers among different Land. For example, child/staff ratios vary from 17/1 to 25/1; group sizes of 25 in kindergartens; and training requirements for teachers. German child care system values highly of the quality of teaching staffs. In every German Land, a teacher must complete four to five years of training requirements, usually composed of one to two years of [[Prakticum|praktikum]], two years of college, and one year of additional praktikum (berufspraktikum).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gormley|first=William T.|last2=Peters|first2=B.

There is no big market for private day care in Germany. Only 4% to 10% of mothers employ [[Nanny|child minders]] (Tagespflege) in 1995.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kreyenfeld|first=Michaela|last2=Hank|first2=Karsten|date=2000|title=Does the Availability of Child Care Influence the Employment of Mothers?

And the high barrier to enter the market set by the government becomes one of the hinders.\n\nAlthough general condition of the child care system can be applied to most of the cases and regions in Germany, there are noticeably big regional differences, especially between west and east Germany. The regional variations in child care supply reflect the fact that regulations are being made at the local community level. According to Tietze, Rossbach & Roitsch survey in 1994, there are variations in the supply of day care services between rural and urban areas, with rural areas being at a disadvantage. In east Germany, there are much larger number of day care slots than in west Germany and higher rate of child care provision, as an inheritance from its former socialist [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]]. The opening hours of the day-care centers vary as well. In west Germany the opening hours of Kindergarten are short, only for half of the day; while in east Germany 97% of the kindergarten offers all-day care including lunch.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kreyenfeld|first=Michaela|last2=Hank|first2=Karsten|date=2000|title=Does the Availability of Child Care Influence the Employment of Mothers?

Thus it explains the fact that Germany aims to provide high-quality early education for children but set the opening hours of day care centers to be short and not convenient to the working parents.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ondrich|first=Jan|last2=Spiess|first2=C.

Having one of the lowest fertility rate among European countries, Germany has on average 1.38 children per woman in 2008 and it keeps on having high level of childlessness among parents. Women in Germany, as in many other countries, face the dilemma between work and family.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rossier|first=Cl\u00e9mentine|last2=Brachet|first2=Sara|last3=Salles|first3=Anne|date=2011|title=Family policies, norms about gender roles and fertility decisions in France and Germany|jstor=41342813|journal=Vienna Yearbook of Population Research|volume=9|pages=259\u2013282|doi=10.1553/populationyearbook2011s259|url=http://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/unige:31543}}</ref> In west Germany, female participation in labor market is low as German income tax system discourages women from labor market due to high unemployment rate. Even for women who have jobs, they usually stop working at the birth of the child because mothers are seen as the best child care providers. 3-year period of [[parental leave]] is provided by the government, with low cash benefits paid under the terms of health insurance. Women tend to stay as housewives when kids are young and return to part-time works after their children grow older. Full-time employment rates are even lower.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hank|first=Karsten|last2=Kreyenfeld|first2=Michaela|date=2003|title=A Multilevel Analysis of Child Care and Women's Fertility Decisions in Western Germany|jstor=3600025|journal=Journal of Marriage and Family|volume=65|issue=3|pages=584\u2013596|doi=10.1111/j.1741-3737.2003.00584.x|url=https://opus4.kobv.de/opus4-hsog/frontdoor/index/index/docId/978}}</ref> In east Germany, however, it witnesses one of the highest female labor participation rate among European countries. As high as 85 per cent of adult women, including those with young kids, participate in labor market. For working mothers, there are several informal child care arrangements they could have. Usually they have their children to be cared for by grandparents or other close relatives. Others send their kids to day care centers. 60% of east German children under age 3 are cared for by the day centers and over 90% of children aged 3 to 6 attend full-day preschool program.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kamerman|first=Sheila B.|last2=Kahn|first2=Alfred J.|date=1979|title=Comparative analysis in family policy: a case study|jstor=23713548|journal=Social Work|volume=24|issue=6|pages=506\u2013512|doi=10.1093/sw/24.6.506}}</ref>\n\nApart from maternity leave, parents are also entitled to a paid leave if their children are ill at home.\n\n==Funding==\nThe social security system in Germany is funded through contributions paid by employees and employers.

However some Manx is used to a very limited extent in official publications, street signs etc., and education in the Manx language is offered in schools. The Manx language knowledge of most people on the island is limited to a few words.\n\nHistorically, [[Old Norse]] was a North Germanic language spoken by inhabitants of Scandinavia and their overseas settlements, including the [[Kingdom of the Isles]], from about the 9th to the 13th centuries. Many place names on the Isle of Man have Old Norse derivations.\n\n==History and politics==\n{{Main|History of the Isle of Man|Politics of the Isle of Man|Isle of Man Government}}\nThe Isle of Man is one of the six [[Celtic nations]], and has been under [[Norsemen|Norse]], Scottish and English control for much of the past thousand years.\n\nThe earliest traces of people in the Isle of Man date to around 8000 BC, during the [[Mesolithic]] Period, also known as the Middle Stone Age. Small, [[nomad]]ic family groups lived in camp sites, hunting wild game, fishing the rivers and coastal waters and gathering plant foods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.im/mnh/collections/archaeology/mesolithic/ |title=Hunter Gatherers \u2013 Isle of Man Government Manx National Heritage: |publisher=Gov.im |accessdate=17 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316143121/http://www.gov.im/mnh/collections/archaeology/mesolithic/ |archivedate=16 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe Neolithic period was marked by important economic and social changes. By 4000 BC, people once reliant upon the uncultivated natural resources of the land and sea had adopted cereal growing and stock rearing, using imported species of grain and animals. Large scale clearance of natural woodland provided fields for crops and animal fodder.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.im/mnh/collections/archaeology/neolithic/ |title=First Farmers \u2013 Isle of Man Government Manx National Heritage: |publisher=Gov.im |accessdate=17 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108050257/http://www.gov.im/mnh/collections/archaeology/neolithic/ |archivedate=8 November 2012 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Iron Age]], Celtic influence began to arrive on the island. Based on inscriptions, the inhabitants appear to have used a [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] language; however, at some point, possibly c. 700 AD, it is assumed that Irish invasion or immigration formed the basis of a new culture, and the Manx came to speak Gaelic. This language has developed in isolation since, though it remains closely related to [[Irish language|Irish]], and [[Scottish Gaelic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.im/mnh/collections/archaeology/ironage/ |title=Celtic Farmers \u2013 Isle of Man Government Manx National Heritage: |publisher=Gov.im |accessdate=17 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316143141/http://www.gov.im/mnh/collections/archaeology/ironage/ |archivedate=16 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\nAt the end of the 8th century, [[Viking]] settlers began to arrive and establish settlements, eventually coming to dominate the island.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.im/mnh/collections/archaeology/vikings/ |title=The Vikings \u2013 Isle of Man Government Manx National Heritage: |publisher=Gov.im |accessdate=17 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112032532/http://www.gov.im/mnh/collections/archaeology/vikings/ |archivedate=12 November 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe Norse [[Kingdom of Mann and the Isles]] was created by [[Godred Crovan]] in 1079. The [[Norsemen|Norse]] had a major impact on the island, leaving behind Norse placenames, and influencing its distinctive political system, [[Tynwald]] (from [[Old Norse]], ''\u00deingv\u00f3llr''), which is one of the oldest parliamentary democracies in the world.\n\nIn 1266, under the [[Treaty of Perth]], Norway's King [[Magnus VI]] ceded the isles to [[Scotland]]. For more than a century the Isle of Man, during the Anglo-Scottish wars, passed between Scotland and England. During this troubled period the Island was captured by the Scottish army of Robert the Bruce in 1313. Later in the 14th century, when England once more seized the Island, the Lordship \u2013 indeed kingship \u2013 was given to the Montacute family, Earls of Salisbury.\n\nIn 1405, the Lordship was granted to Sir John Stanley, whose descendants (later the [[Earl of Derby|Earls of Derby]]) ruled the Isle of Man for over 300 years. The lordship passed through a female line to the [[Duke of Atholl|Dukes of Atholl]] in 1736, and was eventually [[History of the Isle of Man#Revestment|purchased by the British Crown]] in 1765.\n\nSince 1866, when the Isle of Man obtained a measure of [[home rule]], the Manx people have developed into a modern nation with an economy based decreasingly on agriculture and fishing and increasingly first on tourism and then on financial and other services.\n\nThe 20th century saw a revival of interest in Manx music and dance, and in the [[Manx language]], though the last native (first language) speaker of Manx died in the 1970s. In the middle of the 20th century, the [[Taoiseach]] [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] visited, and was so distressed at the lack of support for Manx that he immediately had two recording vans sent over to record the language before it disappeared completely.\n\nAs the century progressed, the Manx tourist economy declined, first because of the effects of the two world wars and later as tourists began to take advantage of cheaper air travel to take European [[package holiday]]s. The Manx government responded in the 1960s by promoting the island as an [[offshore financial centre]]. While this has had beneficial effects on the Manx economy, it has had its detractors, who have pointed to negative aspects such as the effects on local house prices, and perhaps also [[money laundering]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} The economic changes gave a short-lived impetus to Manx nationalism in the 1970s and 1980s, spawning [[Mec Vannin]], a nationalist group, as well as the now-defunct [[Manx National Party]] and {{lang|gv|[[Fo Halloo]]}} (\"Underground\"), which mounted a direct-action campaign of spray-painting and house-burning.

The largest proportion of the population was born on the island, but major settlement by [[English people]] and others has significantly altered the demographics. According to the 2011 census, 47.6% were born in the Isle of Man, and 37.2% were born in England, with smaller numbers born elsewhere: 3.4% in [[Scotland]], 2.1% in [[Northern Ireland]], 2.1% in the [[Republic of Ireland]], 1.2% in [[Wales]] and 0.3% born in the [[Channel Islands]], with 6.1% of the population having been born elsewhere in the world.\n\nManx people living in the UK were commonly grouped by the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 census]] under \"[[White British]]\". The extremely high ratio of \"come-overs\" to \"natives\" has brought with it changes in terms of culture, identity and speech. Manx people have also made a significant contribution elsewhere through migration.

However some Manx is used to a very limited extent in official publications, street signs etc., and education in the Manx language is offered in schools. The Manx language knowledge of most people on the island is limited to a few words.\n\nHistorically, [[Old Norse]] was a North Germanic language spoken by inhabitants of Scandinavia and their overseas settlements, including the [[Kingdom of the Isles]], from about the 9th to the 13th centuries. Many place names on the Isle of Man have Old Norse derivations.\n\n==History and politics==\n{{Main|History of the Isle of Man|Politics of the Isle of Man|Isle of Man Government}}\nThe Isle of Man is one of the six [[Celtic nations]], and has been under [[Norsemen|Norse]], Scottish and English control for much of the past thousand years.\n\nThe earliest traces of people in the Isle of Man date to around 8000 BC, during the [[Mesolithic]] Period, also known as the Middle Stone Age. Small, [[nomad]]ic family groups lived in camp sites, hunting wild game, fishing the rivers and coastal waters and gathering plant foods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.im/mnh/collections/archaeology/mesolithic/ |title=Hunter Gatherers \u2013 Isle of Man Government Manx National Heritage: |publisher=Gov.im |accessdate=17 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316143121/http://www.gov.im/mnh/collections/archaeology/mesolithic/ |archivedate=16 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe Neolithic period was marked by important economic and social changes. By 4000 BC, people once reliant upon the uncultivated natural resources of the land and sea had adopted cereal growing and stock rearing, using imported species of grain and animals. Large scale clearance of natural woodland provided fields for crops and animal fodder.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.im/mnh/collections/archaeology/neolithic/ |title=First Farmers \u2013 Isle of Man Government Manx National Heritage: |publisher=Gov.im |accessdate=17 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108050257/http://www.gov.im/mnh/collections/archaeology/neolithic/ |archivedate=8 November 2012 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Iron Age]], Celtic influence began to arrive on the island. Based on inscriptions, the inhabitants appear to have used a [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] language; however, at some point, possibly c. 700 AD, it is assumed that Irish invasion or immigration formed the basis of a new culture, and the Manx came to speak Gaelic. This language has developed in isolation since, though it remains closely related to [[Irish language|Irish]], and [[Scottish Gaelic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.im/mnh/collections/archaeology/ironage/ |title=Celtic Farmers \u2013 Isle of Man Government Manx National Heritage: |publisher=Gov.im |accessdate=17 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316143141/http://www.gov.im/mnh/collections/archaeology/ironage/ |archivedate=16 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\nAt the end of the 8th century, [[Viking]] settlers began to arrive and establish settlements, eventually coming to dominate the island.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.im/mnh/collections/archaeology/vikings/ |title=The Vikings \u2013 Isle of Man Government Manx National Heritage: |publisher=Gov.im |accessdate=17 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112032532/http://www.gov.im/mnh/collections/archaeology/vikings/ |archivedate=12 November 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe Norse [[Kingdom of Mann and the Isles]] was created by [[Godred Crovan]] in 1079. The [[Norsemen|Norse]] had a major impact on the island, leaving behind Norse placenames, and influencing its distinctive political system, [[Tynwald]] (from [[Old Norse]], ''\u00deingv\u00f3llr''), which is one of the oldest parliamentary democracies in the world.\n\nIn 1266, under the [[Treaty of Perth]], Norway's King [[Magnus VI]] ceded the isles to [[Scotland]]. For more than a century the Isle of Man, during the Anglo-Scottish wars, passed between Scotland and England. During this troubled period the Island was captured by the Scottish army of Robert the Bruce in 1313. Later in the 14th century, when England once more seized the Island, the Lordship \u2013 indeed kingship \u2013 was given to the Montacute family, Earls of Salisbury.\n\nIn 1405, the Lordship was granted to Sir John Stanley, whose descendants (later the [[Earl of Derby|Earls of Derby]]) ruled the Isle of Man for over 300 years. The lordship passed through a female line to the [[Duke of Atholl|Dukes of Atholl]] in 1736, and was eventually [[History of the Isle of Man#Revestment|purchased by the British Crown]] in 1765.\n\nSince 1866, when the Isle of Man obtained a measure of [[home rule]], the Manx people have developed into a modern nation with an economy based decreasingly on agriculture and fishing and increasingly first on tourism and then on financial and other services.\n\nThe 20th century saw a revival of interest in Manx music and dance, and in the [[Manx language]], though the last native (first language) speaker of Manx died in the 1970s. In the middle of the 20th century, the [[Taoiseach]] [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] visited, and was so distressed at the lack of support for Manx that he immediately had two recording vans sent over to record the language before it disappeared completely.\n\nAs the century progressed, the Manx tourist economy declined, first because of the effects of the two world wars and later as tourists began to take advantage of cheaper air travel to take European [[package holiday]]s. The Manx government responded in the 1960s by promoting the island as an [[offshore financial centre]]. While this has had beneficial effects on the Manx economy, it has had its detractors, who have pointed to negative aspects such as the effects on local house prices, and perhaps also [[money laundering]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} The economic changes gave a short-lived impetus to Manx nationalism in the 1970s and 1980s, spawning [[Mec Vannin]], a nationalist group, as well as the now-defunct [[Manx National Party]] and {{lang|gv|[[Fo Halloo]]}} (\"Underground\"), which mounted a direct-action campaign of spray-painting and house-burning. Nationalist politics has since declined and a number of its former proponents are now in mainstream politics.\n\nThe 1990s and early 21st century have seen a greater recognition of indigenous Manx culture, such as the first Manx-medium primary school, though Manx culture still remains on the margins of popular culture for the majority of Manx residents.\n\n===Manx political parties===\nMost Manx politicians are independents rather than [[List of political parties in the Isle of Man|party members]].

These numbers are generally believed to be due to the low number of testing at the time (about 100 tests per day in non-KRG areas), but since then testing capacity has increased and the number of cases are thought to get clearer over the coming weeks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/04/iraq-denies-coronavirus-news-report-suspends-reuters-licence-200403084708197.html|title=Iraq denies coronavirus news report; suspends Reuters' licence |website=www.aljazeera.com/news}}</ref>\n\nOn the '''''4th of April''''', the number of confirmed cases rose to 878, with 259 recoveries. 2 new deaths were also confirmed on the same day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/iraq/|title=Iraq Coronavirus: 878 Cases and 56 Deaths - Worldometer|website=www.worldometers.info|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\nOn the '''''5th of April''''', the number of confirmed cases saw a daily record increase of 83 new and thus' the total number of cases rose to 961, with 279 total recoveries. 5 new deaths were also confirmed on the same day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/iraq/|title=Iraq Coronavirus: 961 Cases and 61 Deaths - Worldometer|website=www.worldometers.info|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> The significant rise in cases were attributed to both the capital Baghdad, which saw a rise of 27 cases, and the KRG capital Erbil, which saw a rise of 18 case.
