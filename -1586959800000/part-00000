Affected crew members were evacuated and the ship was ordered to Guam. The captain, [[Brett Crozier]], wanted most of the crew to be removed from the ship to prevent the spread of the disease, but his superiors balked. After several days Crozier mailed multiple Navy officers begging for the ship to be largely evacuated because the virus could not be contained on board. The letter leaked to the press, and the next day the Navy ordered most of the crew to be taken ashore, but the captain was relieved of command by Acting Secretary of the Navy [[Thomas Modly]]. Modly's order was controversial and his later speech to the crew aboard the ''Roosevelt'', was critized. Modly resigned a few days later. By mid-April hundreds of crew members including Crozier had tested positive for the virus, and one had died.\n\n==Timeline==\nIn spring 2020, the [[United States Navy]] aircraft carrier {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71|2}} was on deployment in the Pacific.\n\n===March===\nOn 5 March, the ship made a four-day-long port call at [[Da Nang]], Vietnam.

coronavirus pandemic]], was detected on the aircraft carrier {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71|6}} in March 2020 while she was at sea. Affected crew members were evacuated and the ship was ordered to Guam. The captain, [[Brett Crozier]], wanted most of the crew to be removed from the ship to prevent the spread of the disease, but his superiors balked. After several days Crozier mailed multiple Navy officers begging for the ship to be largely evacuated because the virus could not be contained on board. The letter leaked to the press, and the next day the Navy ordered most of the crew to be taken ashore, but the captain was relieved of command by Acting Secretary of the Navy [[Thomas Modly]]. Modly's order was controversial and his later speech to the crew aboard the ''Roosevelt'', was critizied. Modly resigned a few days later. By mid-April hundreds of crew members including Crozier had tested positive for the virus, and one had died.\n\n==Timeline==\nIn spring 2020, the [[United States Navy]] aircraft carrier {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71|2}} was on deployment in the Pacific.\n\n===March===\nOn 5 March, the ship made a four-day-long port call at [[Da Nang]], Vietnam.

Additionally, many liner notes from the band's albums list attorney [[Bertis Downs]] and manager [[Jefferson Holt]] as non-musical members.  One of the first [[alternative rock]] bands, R.E.M. was noted for Buck's ringing, [[arpeggiated]] guitar style, Stipe's distinctive vocal quality, unique stage presence and obscure lyrics, Mills's melodic basslines and backing vocals, and Berry's tight, economical drumming, and backing vocals of his own. In the early 1990s, other [[alternative rock]] acts such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] and [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]] viewed R.E.M. as a pioneer of the genre. After Berry left the band in 1997, through some changes in musical style to include [[electronic music]] and [[pop rock]] sounds, the band continued its career in the 2000s with mixed critical and commercial success. The band broke up amicably in 2011 with members devoting time on solo projects despite having sold more than 85 million records worldwide and becoming one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|world's best-selling music artists]].\n\nR.E.M. released its first single, \"[[Radio Free Europe (song)|Radio Free Europe]]\", in 1981 on the independent record label [[Hib-Tone]]. It was followed by the ''[[Chronic Town]]'' [[Extended play|EP]] in 1982, the band's first release on [[I.R.S. Records]]. In 1983, the group released its critically acclaimed debut album, ''[[Murmur (album)|Murmur]]'', and built its reputation over the next few years through subsequent releases each year from 1984 to 1988: ''[[Reckoning (R.E.M. album)|Reckoning]]'', ''[[Fables of the Reconstruction]]'', ''[[Lifes Rich Pageant]]'', ''[[Document (album)|Document]]'' and ''[[Green (R.E.M. album)|Green]]'', including an intermittent b-side compilation ''[[Dead Letter Office (album)|Dead Letter Office]]''. With constant touring, and the support of [[campus radio|college radio]], following years of underground success, R.E.M. achieved a mainstream hit with the 1987 single \"[[The One I Love (R.E.M. song)|The One I Love]]\". The group signed to [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 1988, and began to espouse political and environmental concerns while playing large arenas worldwide.\n\nR.E.M.'s most commercially successful albums, ''[[Out of Time (album)|Out of Time]]'' (1991) and ''[[Automatic for the People]]'' (1992), brought it to the vanguard of alternative rock just as it was becoming mainstream. ''Out of Time'' received seven nominations at the [[34th Annual Grammy Awards]], and lead single \"[[Losing My Religion]]\", was R.E.M.'s highest-charting and best-selling hit. R.E.M.'s 1994 album ''[[Monster (R.E.M. album)|Monster]]'' continued its run of success. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three of the band members. In 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a reported US$80&nbsp;million, at the time the most expensive recording contract in history. The tour however was productive and the band recorded the following album mostly on soundchecks. The resulting record, ''[[New Adventures in Hi-Fi]]'' (1996) is hailed as the band's last great album and members' favourite one, growing in cult status in the years following its release. Berry left the band the following year, and Stipe, Buck, and Mills continued as a trio.\n\nAfter the electronic experimental direction of ''[[Up (R.E.M. album)|Up]]'' (1998) that was commercially unsuccessful, ''[[Reveal (R.E.M. album)|Reveal]]'' (2001) was referred as \"a conscious return to their classic sound\" which received general acclaim. In 2007, the band was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], in its first year of eligibility. In order to \"redeem themselves\" after the lukewarm reception of ''[[Around the Sun]]'' (2004), the band released the well-received albums ''[[Accelerate (R.E.M. album)|Accelerate]]'' (2008) and ''[[Collapse into Now]]'' (2011). R.E.M. disbanded amicably in September 2011, with former members having continued with various musical projects, and several live and archival albums have been released.\n\n==History==\n===1980\u20131982: Formation and first releases===\nIn January 1980, [[Peter Buck]] met [[Michael Stipe]] in [[Wuxtry Records]], the Athens record store where Buck worked.

Additionally, many liner notes from the band's albums list attorney [[Bertis Downs]] and manager [[Jefferson Holt]] as non-musical members.  One of the first [[alternative rock]] bands, R.E.M. was noted for Buck's ringing, [[arpeggiated]] guitar style, Stipe's distinctive vocal quality, unique stage presence and obscure lyrics, Mills's melodic basslines and backing vocals, and Berry's tight, economical drumming, and backing vocals of his own. In the early 1990s, other [[alternative rock]] acts such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] and [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]] viewed R.E.M. as a pioneer of the genre. After Berry left the band in 1997, through some changes in musical style to include [[electronic music]] and [[pop rock]] sounds, the band continued its career in the 2000s with mixed critical and commercial success. The band broke up amicably in 2011 with members devoting time on solo projects despite having sold more than 85 million records worldwide and becoming one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|world's best-selling music artists]].\n\nR.E.M. released its first single, \"[[Radio Free Europe (song)|Radio Free Europe]]\", in 1981 on the independent record label [[Hib-Tone]]. It was followed by the ''[[Chronic Town]]'' [[Extended play|EP]] in 1982, the band's first release on [[I.R.S. Records]]. In 1983, the group released its critically acclaimed debut album, ''[[Murmur (album)|Murmur]]'', and built its reputation over the next few years through subsequent releases each year from 1984 to 1988: ''[[Reckoning (R.E.M. album)|Reckoning]]'', ''[[Fables of the Reconstruction]]'', ''[[Lifes Rich Pageant]]'', ''[[Document (album)|Document]]'' and ''[[Green (R.E.M. album)|Green]]'', including an intermittent b-side compilation ''[[Dead Letter Office (album)|Dead Letter Office]]''. With constant touring, and the support of [[campus radio|college radio]], following years of underground success, R.E.M. achieved a mainstream hit with the 1987 single \"[[The One I Love (R.E.M. song)|The One I Love]]\". The group signed to [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 1988, and began to espouse political and environmental concerns while playing large arenas worldwide.\n\nR.E.M.'s most commercially successful albums, ''[[Out of Time (album)|Out of Time]]'' (1991) and ''[[Automatic for the People]]'' (1992), brought it to the vanguard of alternative rock just as it was becoming mainstream. ''Out of Time'' received seven nominations at the [[34th Annual Grammy Awards]], and lead single \"[[Losing My Religion]]\", was R.E.M.'s highest-charting and best-selling hit. R.E.M.'s 1994 album ''[[Monster (R.E.M. album)|Monster]]'' continued its run of success. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three of the band members. In 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a reported US$80&nbsp;million, at the time the most expensive recording contract in history. The tour however was productive and the band recorded the following album mostly on soundchecks. The resulting record, ''[[New Adventures in Hi-Fi]]'' (1996) is hailed as the band's last great album and members' favourite one, growing in cult status in the years following its release. Berry left the band the following year, and Stipe, Buck, and Mills continued as a trio.\n\nAfter the electronic experimental direction of ''[[Up (R.E.M. album)|Up]]'' (1998) that was commercially unsuccessful, ''[[Reveal (R.E.M. album)|Reveal]]'' (2001) was referred as \"a conscious return to their classic sound\" which received general acclaim. In 2007, the band was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], in its first year of eligibility. In order to \"redeem themselves\" after the lukewarm reception of ''[[Around the Sun]]'' (2004), the band released the well-received albums ''[[Accelerate (R.E.M. album)|Accelerate]]'' (2008) and ''[[Collapse into Now]]'' (2011). R.E.M. disbanded amicably in September 2011, with former members having continued with various musical projects, and several live and archival albums have been released.\n\n==History==\n===1980\u20131982: Formation and first releases===\nIn January 1980, [[Peter Buck]] met [[Michael Stipe]] in [[Wuxtry Records]], the Athens record store where Buck worked.

[[AllMusic]] stated, \"R.E.M. mark the point when [[post-punk]] turned into alternative rock.\"<ref name=\"allmusic\" /> In the early 1980s, the musical style of R.E.M. stood in contrast to the post-punk and [[New wave music|new wave]] genres that had preceded it. Music journalist [[Simon Reynolds]] noted that the post-punk movement of the late 1970s and early 1980s \"had taken whole swaths of music off the menu\", particularly that of the 1960s, and that \"After postpunk's demystification and New Pop's schematics, it felt liberating to listen to music rooted in mystical awe and blissed-out surrender.\" Reynolds declared R.E.M., a band that recalled the music of the 1960s with its \"plangent guitar chimes and folk-styled vocals\" and who \"wistfully and abstractly conjured visions and new frontiers for America\", one of \"the two most important alt-rock bands of the day.\"<ref>Reynolds, Simon.

''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' referred to the \"R.E.M. model\"\u2014career decisions that R.E.M. made which set guidelines for other underground artists to follow in their own careers. ''Spin's'' Charles Aaron wrote that by 1985, \"They'd shown how far an underground, punk-inspired rock band could go within the industry without whoring out its artistic integrity in any obvious way.

Initial development was done over four years from 2009 to 2013, by a team of four developers, lead by Michelle Boucquemont (michelle) and odakyufan. In 2007{{Clarify timeframe|date=November 2018}} most [[Abandonware|active development has ended]], as the main developer Michelle Boucquemont ended her active work. Despite the lacking developer support, around 2009 openBVE was capable of running most BVE Trainsim routes correctly and also supported additional features, including an exterior view, animated 3D cabs, and animated objects.\n\nTo end the stalled development in October 2015 a [[Fork (software)|continuation]] of OpenBVE was announced on ''BVEWorldwide'' by another group of developers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Initial Development Thread|url=http://bveworldwide.unlimitedboard.com/t1229-new-openbve-build-testers-please|website=BVE Worldwide|accessdate=5 December 2016}}</ref> The group transferred the development and codebase to a new repository on [[GitHub]].<ref>[https://github.com/leezer3/OpenBVE/ OpenBVE] on [[github.com]]</ref> To date (May 2017), numerous additions were made by the project: new parameters for animated objects and the plugin API,<ref>{{cite web|title=API and Compatibility changes|url=https://github.com/leezer3/OpenBVE/wiki/Compatibility-Notes}}</ref> several unfixed errata from the previous openBVE 1.4.3 errata fixed,<ref>{{cite web|title=Fixed Errata|url=https://github.com/leezer3/OpenBVE/wiki/Errata}}</ref> [[Dynamic lighting]] and backgrounds added,<ref>{{cite web|title=Dynamic Lighting & Backgrounds|url=http://bveworldwide.unlimitedboard.com/t1326-dynamic-lighting-backgrounds-based-upon-the-time-of-day}}</ref> and a basic [[package format]] has been added to make the installation of addons easier.<ref>{{cite web|title=openBVE Packages|url=http://openbve-project.net/packages/}}</ref>\n\n''OpenBVE'' was selected in September 2013 as \"HotPick\" by [[Linux Format]].<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/Linux_Format_174_September_2013/#page/n61/mode/2up/search/hotgames Linux Format 174 September 2013] page 60</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|title=This Is V-scale|first=Alfred|last=Barten|year=2006|url=http://www.virtualrailroader.com/v-scale.html|id={{Listed Invalid ISBN|1-4276-0738-8}} }}zwer\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.bvets.net/en/ BVE Trainsim website]\n* [http://openbve-project.net openBVE Project website]\n\n[[Category:1996 video games]]\n[[Category:Beta software]]\n[[Category:Train simulation video games]]\n[[Category:Windows-only freeware games]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox video game\n|title= BVE TrainSim\n|image= Bve trainsim logo.png\n|caption= \n|developer= Takashi Kojima (Mackoy)\n|platforms= [[Windows]]\n|released= BVE TS 1:<br />1996<br />BVE TS 2:<br />2001<br />BVE TS 4:<br />2005<br />BVE TS 5:<br />2011\n|genre= [[Train simulator]]\n|modes= [[Single-player]], [[Multi-player]]\n}}\n\n'''BVE Trainsim''' (originally '''Boso View Express'''<ref name=\"Lew\">{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/autopia/2007/12/best-free-train/|title=The Best Free Train Simulator|last=Lew|first=Alexander|date=2007-12-17|work=Autopia|publisher=[[Wired News]]|accessdate=2009-05-04| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090504084001/http://www.wired.com/autopia/2007/12/best-free-train/| archivedate= 4 May 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080801090112/http://simontonekham.wordpress.com/2008/06/01/bve-train-simulator/ BVE Train Simulator](archive), The Simon Tonekham Statesman blog</ref><ref name=\"trainsimmer\"/>) is a Japanese three-dimensional computer-based [[train simulator]].<ref name=\"trainsimmer\"/> It is notable for focusing on providing an accurate driving experience<ref name=\"trainsimmer\"/><ref name=\"cbsi\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/computer/doswin/review/R85301.html|title=Microsoft Train Simulator|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|date=2005-01-03|accessdate=2009-08-14|quote=BVE ... physics are comparable with the real trains. ...

Initial development was done over four years from 2009 to 2013, by a team of four developers, lead by Michelle Boucquemont (michelle) and odakyufan. In 2007{{Clarify timeframe|date=November 2018}} most [[Abandonware|active development has ended]], as the main developer Michelle Boucquemont ended her active work. Despite the lacking developer support, around 2009 openBVE was capable of running most BVE Trainsim routes correctly and also supported additional features, including an exterior view, animated 3D cabs, and animated objects.\n\nTo end the stalled development in October 2015 a [[Fork (software)|continuation]] of OpenBVE was announced on ''BVEWorldwide'' by another group of developers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Initial Development Thread|url=http://bveworldwide.unlimitedboard.com/t1229-new-openbve-build-testers-please|website=BVE Worldwide|accessdate=5 December 2016}}</ref> The group transferred the development and codebase to a new repository on [[GitHub]].<ref>[https://github.com/leezer3/OpenBVE/ OpenBVE] on [[github.com]]</ref> To date (May 2017), numerous additions were made by the project: new parameters for animated objects and the plugin API,<ref>{{cite web|title=API and Compatibility changes|url=https://github.com/leezer3/OpenBVE/wiki/Compatibility-Notes}}</ref> several unfixed errata from the previous openBVE 1.4.3 errata fixed,<ref>{{cite web|title=Fixed Errata|url=https://github.com/leezer3/OpenBVE/wiki/Errata}}</ref> [[Dynamic lighting]] and backgrounds added,<ref>{{cite web|title=Dynamic Lighting & Backgrounds|url=http://bveworldwide.unlimitedboard.com/t1326-dynamic-lighting-backgrounds-based-upon-the-time-of-day}}</ref> and a basic [[package format]] has been added to make the installation of addons easier.<ref>{{cite web|title=openBVE Packages|url=http://openbve-project.net/packages/}}</ref>\n\n''OpenBVE'' was selected in September 2013 as \"HotPick\" by [[Linux Format]].<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/Linux_Format_174_September_2013/#page/n61/mode/2up/search/hotgames Linux Format 174 September 2013] page 60</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|title=This Is V-scale|first=Alfred|last=Barten|year=2006|url=http://www.virtualrailroader.com/v-scale.html|id={{Listed Invalid ISBN|1-4276-0738-8}} }}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.bvets.net/en/ BVE Trainsim website]\n* [http://openbve-project.net openBVE Project website]\n\n[[Category:1996 video games]]\n[[Category:Beta software]]\n[[Category:Train simulation video games]]\n[[Category:Windows-only freeware games]]\n", "name_user": "210.205.230.72", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BVE_Trainsim"}

In OpenShift, such artifacts are considered first class Kubernetes resources upon which standard Kubernetes operations can apply. OpenShift's client program, known as \"oc\", offers a superset of the standard capabilities bundled in the mainline \"kubectl\" client program of Kubernetes.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Caban |first1=William |title=Architecting and Operating OpenShift Clusters: OpenShift for Infrastructure and Operations Teams |date=2019 |publisher=Apress |location=Chapter 2 |isbn=978-1-4842-4984-0}}</ref> Using this client, one can directly interact with the build-related resources using sub-commands (such as \"new-build\" or \"start-build\"). In addition to this, an OpenShift-native pod build technology called Source-to-Image (S2I) is available out of the box. For the OpenShift platform, this provides capabilities equivalent to what [[Jenkins (software)|Jenkins]] can do.\n\nSome other differences when OpenShift is compared to Kubernetes:\n# The v4 product line uses the CRI-O runtime - which means that docker daemons are not present on the master or worker nodes. This improves the security posture of the cluster.\n# The out-of-the-box install of OpenShift comes included with an image repository.\n# ImageStreams (a sequence of pointers to images which can be associated with deployments) and Templates (a packaging mechanism for application components) are unique to OpenShift and simplify application deployment and management.\n# The \"new-app\" command which can be used to initiate an application deployment automatically applies the ''app'' label (with the value of the label taken from the ''--name'' argument) to all resources created as a result of the deployment. This can simplify the management of application resources.\n\nOpenShift introduced the concept of routes - points of traffic ingress into the Kubernetes cluster. The Kubernetes ingress concept was modeled after this.\n\nOpenShift also provides value adds by bundling various software solutions - application runtimes as well as infrastructure components from the Kubernetes ecosystem. For example, for observability needs, Prometheus, Hawkular, and Istio (and their dependencies) are included out of the box.

Many dynasties and rulers dominated Vellore throughout its history, including the [[Pallava dynasty]], [[Medieval Cholas]], [[Later Cholas]], [[Vijayanagar]], the [[Rashtrakuta dynasty]], the [[Sambuvaraya|Sambuvaraya chieftains]], the [[Nawabs of the Carnatic]], and the administration of the [[British Raj|British]]. In the 18th century, Vellore was involved in the [[Carnatic Wars]] between Britain and France. It was situated close to several decisive battles, including those at [[Ambur]] (1749), [[Arcot]] (1751), and [[Vandavasi]] (1760). \n\n[[Vellore Fort]] is important to Vellore's history. Due to a lack of historical records, it is not known exactly when the fort was constructed, but estimates based on stone inscriptions suggests that the fort was most likely built during the rule of Chinna Bommi Nayak between 1526 and 1595. The fort is a good example of [[Architecture of Tamil Nadu|Tamil Nadu military architecture]], while the [[Jalakandeswarar Temple, Vellore|Jalakandeswarar Temple]] within the fort represents [[Vijayanagara architecture]].\n\n[[Christian Medical College & Hospital, Vellore|Christian Medical College & Hospital]], founded in 1900 by the American medical missionary [[Ida S. Scudder|Dr. Ida S. Scudder]], is another Vellore landmark. The hospital has grown into a medical institution of international repute.{{cn|date=March 2020}} \n\nThe central prison in Vellore, established in 1830, had imprisoned notable figures like [[C. Rajagopalachari]] and  [[Ramaswamy Venkataraman]]. Other landmarks include the Aruganthampoodi mausoleums, located close to the section of [[National Highway 48 (India)|National Highway 48]] between Vellore and Arcot, where the family members of [[Tipu Sultan]] were buried; and the Muthu Mandapam, a memorial on the banks of [[Palar River]] built by the Tamil Nadu Government to honor [[Sri Vikrama Rajasinha]], the last ruler of the [[Kingdom of Kandy]] in [[Sri Lanka]], who ruled from 1798 to 1815 and was imprisoned in Vellore Fort for 17 years until his death.\n\n===Vellore Fort===\n{{Main|Vellore Fort}}\n\nThe fort of Vellore was built around 1566 CE by the chieftains of Sadashiv Raya of the Vijayanagara Empire. In the mid-17th century the fort was owned by various parties. The Aravidus, the last dynasty that ruled Vijayanagara lost Vellore to the Bijapur Sultan before being captured by the Marathas after a siege that lasted four and a half months in 1676. The fort came under the charge of Dost Ali, the Nawab of Carnatic, before passing on to the British in 1760. Vellore Fort withstood Hyder Ali's siege from 1780\u201382, and would later become the base for Lord Cornwallis\u2019 march on Bangalore to defeat Tipu Sultan.\n\nWhen Tipu Sultan was killed at Sringapatam during the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War (1798-79 CE), his kingdom was handed back to the Hindu Wodeyar kings of Mysore and the British exiled Tipu's surviving sons, daughters, their families, and their entire entourage to Vellore Fort. They stayed in the palaces in the fort and participated in the Mutiny of 1806.\n\n===Vellore mutiny===\n{{Main|Vellore Mutiny}}\n\nIn 1805, the new Commander-in-Chief of the [[Madras Army]] of the [[British East Indian Company]], [[John Cradock, 1st Baron Howden|General Sir John Cradock]], began an ambitious reform of the army's disciplinary system. New, standardized regulations were approved for the Madras Army, which dictated how [[sepoy]]s should wear their uniforms and appear on duty. Under these regulations, Hindus were prohibited from wearing religious marks on their foreheads while on duty, and Muslims were required to shave their beards and trim their moustaches. One change that was especially problematic was a new headdress associated with Indian converts to Christianity, which included a leather [[cockade]]. This caused an uproar, as leather was a cultural taboo for the upper caste sepoys of the Madras Army. As a result, many sepoys believed that their British officers were conspiring to convert them to Christianity. \n\nIn May 1806, a few soldiers protested against these changes and were sent to [[Fort St. George, India|Fort St. George]] in Chennai, where they were publicly lashed and discharged from the army. With the levels of resentment towards the British already high, the sons of the deceased [[Tipu Sultan]] exacerbated the conflict by assisting the mutineers who revolted on 10 July. Under the pretense of attending the wedding of one of Tipu Sultan's daughters, mutineers gathered in Vellore Fort where the wedding was held and revolted. Raising the flag of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]], they declared Tipu Sultan's son Fateh Hyder king. The mutineers caused about 200 British casualties before their revolt was put down by British reinforcements under Sir [[Rollo Gillespie]], and many of the mutineers were either summarily shot, captured, court-martialed, and/or executed.\n\nAs a result of the uprising, the dress codes were retracted, and Cradock was dismissed. Although the mutiny took place before larger revolts in the 1850s, it was indicative of the simmering dissent in the Indian soldiery. The Vellore mutiny is considered to be the first large-scale Indian mutiny against the British, and a prelude to the much larger [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Sepoy Mutiny]] in 1857.\n\n==Economic, Social and Cultural Changes in Vellore in the 20th Century==\nThe economic condition of the district in the earlier stages was not sound with the absence of major industries. Industries like Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. Ranipet, Tamil Nadu Explosives Ltd., and Vellore Katpadi were established as the result of governmental police. There has been notable growth of small scale industries and tanneries in the district, which not only generated employment opportunities, but also contributed economic growth to farmers. Uzhavar Sandhai helped the rural poor improve the economy. Women-driven self help groups played an important role in building rural economy and teaching rural women to be self-reliant.\nVellore also changed socially as time went by. Increased social awareness and upward social growth marked the successful foundation of its districts. Literacy improved in part of the Arivoli Movement.\n\nDuring the first half of the 19th century, the town came under [[British rule in India|British rule]].<ref name=\"urbaninfra12\">[[#urban|Urban Infrastructure Report]] 2008, p. 12</ref>\n\n==Geography and climate==\n[[File:Night View City of Vellore.jpg|thumb|AnnaSalai]]\nVellore is at {{Coord|12.92|N|79.13|E}}, 220m above sea level.

Many dynasties and rulers dominated Vellore throughout its history, including the [[Pallava dynasty]], [[Medieval Cholas]], [[Later Cholas]], [[Vijayanagar]], the [[Rashtrakuta dynasty]], the [[Sambuvaraya|Sambuvaraya chieftains]], the [[Nawabs of the Carnatic]], and the administration of the [[British Raj|British]]. In the 18th century, Vellore was involved in the [[Carnatic Wars]] between Britain and France. It was situated close to several decisive battles, including those at [[Ambur]] (1749), [[Arcot]] (1751), and [[Vandavasi]] (1760). \n\n[[Vellore Fort]] is important to Vellore's history. Due to a lack of historical records, it is not known exactly when the fort was constructed, but estimates based on stone inscriptions suggests that the fort was most likely built during the rule of Chinna Bommi Nayak between 1526 and 1595. The fort is a good example of [[Architecture of Tamil Nadu|Tamil Nadu military architecture]], while the [[Jalakandeswarar Temple, Vellore|Jalakandeswarar Temple]] within the fort represents [[Vijayanagara architecture]].\n\n[[Christian Medical College & Hospital, Vellore|Christian Medical College & Hospital]], founded in 1900 by the American medical missionary [[Ida S. Scudder|Dr. Ida S. Scudder]], is another Vellore landmark. The hospital has grown into a medical institution of international repute.{{cn|date=March 2020}} \n\nThe central prison in Vellore, established in 1830, had imprisoned notable figures like [[C. Rajagopalachari]] and  [[Ramaswamy Venkataraman]]. Other landmarks include the Aruganthampoodi mausoleums, located close to the section of [[National Highway 48 (India)|National Highway 48]] between Vellore and Arcot, where the family members of [[Tipu Sultan]] were buried; and the Muthu Mandapam, a memorial on the banks of [[Palar River]] built by the Tamil Nadu Government to honor [[Sri Vikrama Rajasinha]], the last ruler of the [[Kingdom of Kandy]] in [[Sri Lanka]], who ruled from 1798 to 1815 and was imprisoned in Vellore Fort for 17 years until his death.\n\n===Vellore Fort===\n{{Main|Vellore Fort}}\n\nThe fort of Vellore was built around 1566 CE by the chieftains of Sadashiv Raya of the Vijayanagara Empire. In the mid-17th century the fort was owned by various parties. The Aravidus, the last dynasty that ruled Vijayanagara lost Vellore to the Bijapur Sultan before being captured by the Marathas after a siege that lasted four and a half months in 1676. The fort came under the charge of Dost Ali, the Nawab of Carnatic, before passing on to the British in 1760. Vellore Fort withstood Hyder Ali's siege from 1780\u201382, and would later become the base for Lord Cornwallis\u2019 march on Bangalore to defeat Tipu Sultan.\n\nWhen Tipu Sultan was killed at Sringapatam during the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War (1798-79 CE), his kingdom was handed back to the Hindu Wodeyar kings of Mysore and the British exiled Tipu's surviving sons, daughters, their families, and their entire entourage to Vellore Fort. They stayed in the palaces in the fort and participated in the Mutiny of 1806.\n\n===Vellore mutiny===\n{{Main|Vellore Mutiny}}\n\nIn 1805, the new Commander-in-Chief of the [[Madras Army]] of the [[British East Indian Company]], [[John Cradock, 1st Baron Howden|General Sir John Cradock]], began an ambitious reform of the army's disciplinary system. New, standardized regulations were approved for the Madras Army, which dictated how [[sepoy]]s should wear their uniforms and appear on duty. Under these regulations, Hindus were prohibited from wearing religious marks on their foreheads while on duty, and Muslims were required to shave their beards and trim their moustaches. One change that was especially problematic was a new headdress associated with Indian converts to Christianity, which included a leather [[cockade]]. This caused an uproar, as leather was a cultural taboo for the upper caste sepoys of the Madras Army. As a result, many sepoys believed that their British officers were conspiring to convert them to Christianity. \n\nIn May 1806, a few soldiers protested against these changes and were sent to [[Fort St. George, India|Fort St. George]] in Chennai, where they were publicly lashed and discharged from the army. With the levels of resentment towards the British already high, the sons of the deceased [[Tipu Sultan]] exacerbated the conflict by assisting the mutineers who revolted on 10 July. Under the pretense of attending the wedding of one of Tipu Sultan's daughters, mutineers gathered in Vellore Fort where the wedding was held and revolted. Raising the flag of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]], they declared Tipu Sultan's son Fateh Hyder king. The mutineers caused about 200 British casualties before their revolt was put down by British reinforcements under Sir [[Rollo Gillespie]], and many of the mutineers were either summarily shot, captured, court-martialed, and/or executed.\n\nAs a result of the uprising, the dress codes were retracted, and Cradock was dismissed. Although the mutiny took place before larger revolts in the 1850s, it was indicative of the simmering dissent in the Indian soldiery. The Vellore mutiny is considered to be the first large-scale Indian mutiny against the British, and a prelude to the much larger [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Sepoy Mutiny]] in 1857.\n\n==Economic, Social and Cultural Changes in Vellore in the 20th Century==\nThe economic condition of the district in the earlier stages was not sound with the absence of major industries. Industries like Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. Ranipet, Tamil Nadu Explosives Ltd., and Vellore Katpadi were established as the result of governmental police. There has been notable growth of small scale industries and tanneries in the district, which not only generated employment opportunities, but also contributed economic growth to farmers. Uzhavar Sandhai helped the rural poor improve the economy. Women-driven self help groups played an important role in building rural economy and teaching rural women to be self-reliant.\nVellore also changed socially as time went by. Increased social awareness and upward social growth marked the successful foundation of its districts. Literacy improved in part of the Arivoli Movement.\n\nDuring the first half of the 19th century, the town came under [[British rule in India|British rule]].<ref name=\"urbaninfra12\">[[#urban|Urban Infrastructure Report]] 2008, p. 12</ref>\n\n==Geography and climate==\n[[File:Night View City of Vellore.jpg|thumb|AnnaSalai]]\nVellore is at {{Coord|12.92|N|79.13|E}}, 220m above sea level.
