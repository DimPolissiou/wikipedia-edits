Although there was significant variation among these economies, Soviet-type planning and Soviet-type economies refers to the major structural characteristics common to these economies.<ref name=\"Gentry & Rogers 2008\">{{cite book|last1=Gentry|first1=Sammy|last2=Rogers|first2=Spencer|year=2008|title=Economic Development and Planning|publisher=Scientific e-Resources|pages=34}}</ref>\n\nSoviet-type planning is a form of economic planning involving [[centralized]] investment decisions, administrative allocation of economic inputs, [[Material balance planning|material balances]] to reach equilibrium between available inputs and targeted outputs, and to some extent the use of [[linear optimization]] to optimize the plans.<ref name=\"Gentry & Rogers 2008\"/>\n\n== Characteristics ==\n=== Institutions ===\nThe major institutions of Soviet-type planning in the Soviet Union included a planning agency ([[Gosplan]]), an organization for allocating state supplies among the various organizations and enterprises in the economy ([[Gossnab]]), and [[Enterprises in the Soviet Union|enterprises]] which were engaged in the production and delivery of goods and services in the economy.

This method of planning involved the accounting of material supplies in natural units (as opposed to monetary terms), which are used to balance the supply of available inputs with targeted outputs. Material balancing involves taking a survey of available inputs and raw [[materials]] in the economy and then using a balance-sheet to balance them with output targets specified by industry to achieve a balance between supply and demand. This balance is used to formulate a plan for the national economy.<ref>''Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century'', 2003, by Gregory and Stuart. {{ISBN|0-618-26181-8}}. \"Material Balance Planning\", (P.127)</ref>\n\n== Analysis of Soviet-type planning ==\n{{economic systems sidebar|by model}}\nThere are two fundamental ways scholars have carried out an analysis of Soviet-type economic planning. The first involves adapting standard [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] economic models and theories to analyze the [[Economy of the Soviet Union|Soviet economic system]]. This paradigm stresses the importance of [[Pareto efficiency|Pareto efficiency standard]].<ref name=Rosefielde>{{cite book |last=Rosefielde|first=Steven|title=The Russian Economy: From Lenin to Putin|year=2007|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Malden, MA|pages=9}}</ref> In contrast to this approach, scholars like Pawel Dembinski argue that neo-classical tools are somewhat inappropriate for evaluating Soviet-type planning because they attempt to quantify and measure phenomena specific to capitalist-based economies.<ref name=Dembinski>{{cite book |last=Dembinski|first=Pawel H.|title=The Logic of the Planned Economy: The Seeds of the Collapse|year=1991|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|pages=1\u20132}}</ref> They contend that, because standard economic models rely on assumptions not fulfilled in the Soviet system (especially the [[Rational choice theory|assumption of economic rationality]] underlying decision-making), the results obtained from a neo-classical analysis will distort the actual effects of STP. These other scholars proceed along a different course, trying to engage with STP on its own terms, investigating the philosophical, historical, and political influences that gave rise to STP, and evaluating its economic successes and failures (theoretical and actual) with reference to those contexts.\n\nThe USSR practiced some form of [[central planning]] beginning in 1918 with [[War Communism]] until it dissolved in 1991, although the type and extent of planning was of a different nature before imperative [[centralized planning]] was introduced in the 1930s. While there were many subtleties to the various forms of economic organization the USSR employed during this 70-year time period, enough features were shared that scholars have broadly examined advantages and disadvantages of Soviet-type economic planning. Soviet is not the same as [[economic planning]] in general \u2013 there are other theoretical models of economic planning, and modern [[mixed economies]] also practice economic planning to a certain extent, but they are not subject to all of the advantages and disadvantages enumerated here.\n\n=== Advantages ===\nFrom a neoclassical perspective, the advantages of STP are quite limited. One advantage of STP is the theoretical possibility to avoid [[inflation]].<ref name=Jeffries>{{cite book |last=Jeffries|first=Ian|title=A Guide to the Socialist Economies|year=1989|publisher=Routledge|location=London; New York|pages=8}}</ref> Complete price stability is achievable, not only because the state plans all prices and quantities, but also because the state has complete control over the [[money supply]] via the wages it pays as the sole employer. Therefore, to maintain a fixed currency value, all the state must do is balance the total value of goods available during a given planning period with the amount of wages it pays according to the following equation,<ref>Jeffries, 16.</ref> where <math>P</math> represents the general retail price level, <math>Q</math> accounts for the quantity of consumer goods and services, <math>Y</math> is total household income (wages paid), <math>\\mathit{TP}</math> is [[transfer payments]], <math>S</math> is household saving, and <math>T</math> is direct household taxes:\n<math display=block>P\\times Q=Y+\\mathit{TP}-S-T</math>\n\nHowever, the USSR arguably never realized this theoretical possibility.<ref>Jeffries, 16-17.</ref> It suffered from both open and repressed inflation throughout much of its history because of failure to balance the above equation.\n\nAnother advantage of economic planning from the neoclassical perspective is the ability to eliminate [[unemployment]] (with the exception of [[frictional unemployment]]) and [[business cycles]].<ref name=\"Jeffries, 12\">Jeffries, 12.</ref> Since the state is effectively the sole business proprietor and controls banking, it theoretically avoids classic financial frictions and consumer confidence challenges. Also, because the state makes labor compulsory and can run enterprises at a loss, full employment is a theoretical possibility even when capital stocks are too low to justify it in a market system. This was an advantage that the USSR arguably realized by 1930,<ref name=\"Jeffries, 12\"/> although critics argue that sometimes certain segments of Soviet labor exhibited zero productivity, meaning that though workers were on employment rolls, they essentially sat idle because of capital deficiencies; ''i.e.'', there was employed unemployment.<ref>Rosefield, 19.</ref>\n\nThose scholars who reject the neoclassical viewpoint consider the benefits of STP that the USSR itself adduced. One is the ability to control for [[externalities]] directly in the pricing mechanism.<ref name=\"Dembinski, 70\">Dembinski, 70.</ref> Another is the total capture of value obtained in STP which is neglected in market economies.<ref>Dembinski, 69.</ref> By this it is meant that while a worker might put in a certain amount of work to produce a good, a market might value that good at less than the cost of labor the worker put in, effectively negating the value of the work done. But, because in STP prices are set by the state, STP avoids this pitfall by never pricing an item below its labor value. While these do seem to be valid theoretical advantages to STP (especially under a [[Marxist]] framework), it has been argued by some that STP as implemented by the USSR failed to achieve these theoretical possibilities.<ref name=\"Dembinski, 70\"/>\n\nIt is claimed that centrally-planned economies also provide a better quality of life than market economies at the same level of economic development in nearly all cases.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cereseto|first=Shirley|date=June 1986|title=Economic Development, Political-Economic System, and the Physical Quality of Life|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume= 76|issue=6|pages=661\u2013666|pmc=1646771|pmid=3706593|doi=10.2105/ajph.76.6.661}}</ref>\n\n=== Disadvantages ===\n{{POV section|date=December 2017}}\nFrom a neoclassical perspective, there were many disadvantages to STP. They can be divided into two categories: [[macroeconomic]] and [[microeconomic]].\n\nMacroeconomic disadvantages included systemic [[undersupply]], the pursuit of [[full employment]] at a steep cost, price fixing's devastating effect on agricultural [[incentives]], and the loss of the [[Money|advantages of money]] because STP eschews money's classic role.<ref>Rosefielde, 19. Jeffries 7, 15, 19.</ref> Systemic undersupply was caused in STP because of the use of \"[[material balances]]\" (plans for the balanced production and consumption of goods and productive inputs), which are theoretically possible, but practically impossible to produce because planners cannot acquire enough [[perfect information|information]] to craft them accurately{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}. Additionally, planners had to aggregate many types of goods and inputs into a single material balance because it was impossible to create an individual balance for each of the approximately 24 million items produced and consumed in the USSR.<ref name=\"Jeffries, 15\">Jeffries, 15.</ref> This system introduced a strong bias towards underproduction, resulting in a scarcity of consumer goods. Another disadvantage is that while STP does allow for the theoretically possibility of full employment, the USSR often achieved full employment by operating enterprises at a loss or leaving workers idle. Therefore, there was always a Pareto superior alternative available to the USSR rather than full employment, specifically, the option to close some enterprises and make transfer payments to the unemployed.<ref>Rosefielde, 19.</ref>\n\nThe microeconomic disadvantages from a neoclassical perspective include:<ref>Jeffries, 8, 13-15, 22.</ref> \n* Encouragement of [[Black market|black-market activity]] because of fixed resource allocation\n* Low quality of Soviet goods induced by [[Trade barrier|shielding]] them from world markets \n* The neglect of consumer need because of the challenge in measuring good quality \n* The tendency of enterprise-level Soviet managers to understate productive capacity in fear of the \"[[ratchet effect]]\". This effect resulted from an enterprise overproducing in a given plan cycle. They would have to match their new level of higher production in the next cycle as the plan was \"adjusted\" to fit the new data.\n* An anti-innovation bias (also from fear of the [[ratchet effect]])\n* \"Storming\" (''[[shturmovshchina]]'') which was the hurry to complete the plan at the end of a planning cycle resulting in poor production quality\n* \"Scattering\" of resources (excessive spread, ''raspylenie sredstv''), where too many projects (esp. construction) would have been started simultaneously and it took much longer to complete because of a lack of available inputs on time\n\nScholars who reject the neoclassical approach produce a shorter list of disadvantages, but because these disadvantages are valid even from the Soviet perspective, they are perhaps even more damning of STP than those listed above. These scholars consider STP's inability to predict things like weather, trade, and technological advancement as an insurmountable drawback to the planning procedure.<ref>Dembinski, 71.</ref> Without exhaustive knowledge of those things, planning would (and did) systemically misappropriate resources{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}. Also, STP's use of coercive techniques (e.g. ratchet effect, [[Gulag|labor camps]], etc.), which are argued to be inherent to STP, on the one hand ensured the system's survival and on the other hand resulted in the [[information asymmetry|distorted information]] that made effective planning challenging if not impossible.<ref>Dembinski, 76, 80.</ref> And lastly these scholars argue that the semantic limitations of language made it impossible for STP planners to communicate their desires to enterprises in sufficient detail for planning to fully direct economic outcomes.<ref>Dembinski, 81.</ref> Enterprises themselves under STP still made a variety of economic decisions autonomously.\n\nOther scholars have argued following the collapse of the USSR argued that a central deficiency of Soviet economic planning was that it was not premised on final consumer demand, and that such a system would be increasingly feasible with advances in information technology.<ref>Mandel, E. 1986.

In 1913, prior to the revolution, the Russian Empire had a GDP per capita of $1,488 in 1990 international dollars, which grew 461% to $6,871 by 1990.

Taipei: Unitas Publishing Co., Ltd., 1997.\u2014A collection of short stories about Syaman Rapongan's life on Lanyu; the book marks the writer's constant struggles with himself and his family because he voluntarily went unemployed and devoted himself solely to the ocean as a bare-hand diver in order to explore Tao civilization and find the meaning of life.

Calling him-self a nomadic soul, Syaman Rapongan knows there may be no end to his battle. His course is a romantic one, without any definite plan. Nor will his beloved sea offer any answer or guidance. Nevertheless, consolation can be found in sweet solitude and family understanding.

Taipei: INK Literary Publishing Co., Ltd., 2009.\u2014Syaman Rapongan's second novel; highly praised and awarded (The Wu Lu-chin Prize for Essays, Chiu Ko Publishing Co. Annual Selection in 2006). Instead of following the previous semi-biographical direction, Syaman Rapongan focuses on three outcasts on his island, Ngalomirem, Tagangan and Zomagpit, whose pretty names fail to bring them pretty lives. Ngalomiren is regarded as a psychopath, Tagangan a miserable student though a brilliant octopus-catcher, and Zomagpit a hopeless drunkard. Through these figures, Syaman Rapongan portrays how Tao society stumbles between traditionality and modernity, and how broken the society has become in both material and mental terms as its humble and simple way becomes recognized again. In spite of a slight hope for reconciliation, this way back to the humble and simple Tao world is arduous, sometimes painful, and fully filled with regrets.\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons

In the early 1870s, [[William Campbell (missionary)|William Campbell]] saw the island from aboard the ''Daphne'', and wrote:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/sketchesfromtaiw00camprich/page/47|title=Sketches from Formosa|author=William Campbell|date=1915|pages=46\u201347}}</ref>\n\n{{quotation|We had a very stormy passage, so much so, that my servant boy and the Chinese preacher (Chiu Paw-ha) who accompanied me, were dead sick during the seven days we were at sea. While laboring off the Island of Botel Tobago, our mainsail was torn in pieces ; and, for several days, every other great sea we faced threatened to engulf us. I was sorry for the poor ship-hands, who had to work hard, and be content with mere snatches of time for food and sleep. It was only through repeated drenchings, and with firm holding on, that I succeeded in getting a good look at the land which came now and then into view.\n\nEvery one was interested as we approached Botel Tobago. The last European visit to it was by a surveying party from H.M.S. ''Sylvia'' in 1867. It stands about twenty-six miles out from the south-eastern end of Formosa, is seven and a half miles long, and densely peopled by an aboriginal race. We saw their huts, and could make out rows of little canoes or rafts drawn up on the beach.}}\n\n=== Imperial Japan ===\nDuring [[imperial Japan|Japan]]'s [[Japanese Taiwan|occupation of Taiwan]], its government declared K\u014dt\u014d Island an [[ethnology|ethnological]] research area off-limits to the general public.\n\n=== Republic of China ===\nAfter the [[Republic of China]] [[Retrocession Day|regained Taiwan]], the island was administered as the Hong-tou-yu \"[[township (Taiwan)|township]]\" of [[Taitung County]] after 19 January 1946 but the Japanese restrictions on visitors remained in effect.

The [[Lanyu Storage Site|plant]] receives nuclear waste from Taiwan's three nuclear power plants operated by state utility [[Taiwan Power Company]] (Taipower). Islanders did not have a say in the decision to locate the facility on the island.<ref name=\"orchis2002\" />\n\nIn 2002, almost 2000 protesters, including many residents and elementary and high school students from the island, staged a sit-in in front of the storage plant, calling on Taipower to remove nuclear waste from the island.

Taipower has for years been exploring ways to ship the nuclear waste overseas for final storage, but plans to store the waste in an abandoned North Korean coal mine have met with strong protests from neighboring South Korea and Japan due to safety and environmental concerns, while storage in Russia or China is complicated by political factors. Taipower is \"trying to convince the islanders to extend the storage arrangement for another nine years in exchange for payment of [[NT$]]200 million (about [[USD|$]]5.7 million)\".<ref name=\"orchis2002\" />\n\nFollowing years of protests by residents, more concerns arose about the facility after Japan's [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]] in 2011. A report released in November 2011 said a radioactive leak had been detected outside the facility and this has added to residents\u2019 concerns. In February 2012, hundreds of Tao living on Orchid Island held a protest outside the nuclear waste storage facility.<ref name=\"tt2012\" /> Chang Hai-yu, a preacher at a local church, said \"it was a tragedy that Tao children are being born into a radiation-filled environment\". Lanyu mayor Chiang To-li \"urged Taipower to remove nuclear waste from the island as soon as possible\".<ref name=\"tt2012\" />\n\nIn March 2012, about 2,000 people staged an anti-nuclear protest in Taiwan's capital [[Taipei]]. Scores of aboriginal protesters \"demanded the removal of 100,000 barrels of nuclear waste stored on Orchid Island, off south-eastern Taiwan.

Commissioned in 1982, the plant has a total installed capacity of 6.5 MW and is owned and operated by [[Taipower]]. Stipulated under Article 14 of the Offshore Islands Development Act, households on the island enjoy free electricity.

In 2011, the average annual electricity consumption per household in Lanyu was 6,522 kWh, almost twice the 3,654 kWh Taiwan average. In 2002, Taipower provided an equivalent of NT$6.35 million worth of electricity to the island, and in 2011 the amount rose to NT$24.39 million. Due to this suspected abuse, members of [[Control Yuan]] called for an investigation into the electricity subsidy to Lanyu Island in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/local/offshore-islands/2012/07/17/347845/Control-Yuan.htm|title=The China Post|website=The China Post}}</ref>\n\n== Tourist attractions ==\n[[File:The Lanyu Lighthouse in Orchid Island 2010-9-14.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Lanyu Lighthouse]]]]\n* [[Lanyu Flying Fish Cultural Museum]]\n* [[Lanyu Lighthouse]]\n* [[Lanyu Weather Station]]\n\n[[File:Lanyu Airport building front 2008b.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Lanyu Airport]]]]\n\n== Transport ==\nThe island is accessible by sea or air.

Taipei: Unitas Publishing Co., Ltd., 1997.\u2014A collection of short stories about Syaman Rapongan's life on Lanyu; the book marks the writer's constant struggles with himself and his family because he voluntarily went unemployed and devoted himself solely to the ocean as a bare-hand diver in order to explore Tao civilization and find the meaning of life. The book also marks the writer's initial identity transition from a Sinicized man to a real Tao who embraces the value of physical labor and learns to cultivate the art of story-telling. The book was the Annual Reading for 1997 by United Daily News.\n* Heise de Chibang \u300a\u9ed1\u8272\u7684\u7fc5\u8180\u300b (Black Wings). Taipei: Morning Star Publishing Co., 1999.\u2014Syaman Rapongan's first novel; it questions the future of Tao people through the characterization of four young men (Kaswal, Gigimit, Jyavehai and Ngalolog) Should they run rigorously after the tempting \u2018white body\u2019 on the land or wait patiently for the arrival of \u2018black wings\u2019 on the sea? Although this appears a rhetorical question, Syaman Rapongan reveals that the conflicts are severe and their impact profound. This novel won Wu Zhuo-liou Literary Award in 1999.\n* Hailang de Jiyi \u300a\u6d77\u6d6a\u7684\u8a18\u61b6\u300b (Memory of the Ocean Waves). Taipei: Unitas Publishing Co., Ltd., 2002.\u2014Another collection of short stories; divided into two parts, with the first on the countless ties between Tao and the sea (six stories), and the second on Tao's staunch fights against foreign influences. Experimenting boldly with different genre and languages, the writer combines verses with prose and juxtaposes Tao and Chinese languages. As another Taiwanese writer and critic, Song Ze-lai, points out, Syaman Rapongan deliberately defamiliarizes his language and syntax in order to praise traditional Tao values and to guide his readers, especially Tao, back to the original way of living, far from influences of Chinese culture and modern civilization.\n* Hanghaijia de Lian \u300a\u822a\u6d77\u5bb6\u7684\u81c9\u300b (The Face of a Navigator). Taipei: INK Literary Publishing Co., 2007.\u2014Also a collection of articles; it continues the oceanic theme but exposes more of Syaman Rapongan's personal battles with modernity or traditionality and his pursuit of prosperity or return to innocence. Calling him-self a nomadic soul, Syaman Rapongan knows there may be no end to his battle. His course is a romantic one, without any definite plan. Nor will his beloved sea offer any answer or guidance. Nevertheless, consolation can be found in sweet solitude and family understanding. Syaman Rapongan's first attempt at trans-Pacific navigation with a Japanese captain and five Indonesian crew members is also included here.\n* Lao Hairen \u300a\u8001\u6d77\u4eba\u300b (Old Ama Divers). Taipei: INK Literary Publishing Co., Ltd., 2009.\u2014Syaman Rapongan's second novel; highly praised and awarded (The Wu Lu-chin Prize for Essays, Chiu Ko Publishing Co. Annual Selection in 2006). Instead of following the previous semi-biographical direction, Syaman Rapongan focuses on three outcasts on his island, Ngalomirem, Tagangan and Zomagpit, whose pretty names fail to bring them pretty lives. Ngalomiren is regarded as a psychopath, Tagangan a miserable student though a brilliant octopus-catcher, and Zomagpit a hopeless drunkard. Through these figures, Syaman Rapongan portrays how Tao society stumbles between traditionality and modernity, and how broken the society has become in both material and mental terms as its humble and simple way becomes recognized again. In spite of a slight hope for reconciliation, this way back to the humble and simple Tao world is arduous, sometimes painful, and fully filled with regrets.\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Lanyu Township, Taitung}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090726225716/http://www.uga.edu/~asian-lp/jpn_html/yami/chpt.1.html Taiwan Aborigine Monograph Series 2]\n* [http://indigenous.pristine.net/perspectives/lanyu/index_en.html Taipei Multicultural Arts Group]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20101003155747/http://www.thewildeast.net/news/2010/06/cultural-survival-on-taiwan%E2%80%99s-orchid-island/ Cultural Survival on Orchid Island]\n* [https://lanyu.land/ Some information and pictures about the island]\n* [http://gptaiwan.yam.org.tw/english_version/nk_dump.html Taipower, North Korea strike accord on nuke waste storage]\n* [http://www10.antenna.nl/wise/index.html?http://www10.antenna.nl/wise/387-8/orchid.html Orchid Island: Taiwan's nuclear dumpsite]\n* [http://reading.udn.com/act/syaman/index-en.html Syaman Rapongan, Taiwan's Ocean Literature Writer]\n* [https://www.bbc.com/news/world-radio-and-tv-15182502 BBC News: Taiwan's paradise island fights to save its identity]\n* [http://www.erenlai.com/en/focus/2011-focus/the-pacific-culture-of-taiwan/item/4132-a-subaqueous-loner-syaman-rapongan.html A subaqueous loner \u2014 Syaman Rapongan]\n\n{{Taiwan Taitung divisions}}\n{{Townships in Taiwan}}\n{{Taiwanese aboriginal areas}}\n{{Taiwan Outlying islands divisions}}\n\n[[Category:Islands of Taiwan]]\n[[Category:Lands inhabited by indigenous peoples]]\n[[Category:Landforms of Taitung County]]\n", "name_user": "SciPunk", "label": "safe", "comment": "added source", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchid_Island"}

They came to Belgium in 1964 during a migration wave.<ref name=\"Frederix\"/> When Touzani was 8 years old, he and his parents took part in a demonstration against racism, which had a deep and lasting impact on him. He began to develop a strong interest in protest, political ideologies, forms of government and human rights. In this formative period, the Belgian-Moroccan dissident Mohammed el Baroudi had an important influence on the evolution of his ideas. He chose democracy and dialogue over violent resistance and authoritarianism.<ref name=\"Frederix\"/>\n\nHe discovered theatre, comedy and humour as a means to make people think, question their views and start necessary discussions about societal issues.<ref name=\"Frederix\"/> He read up on philosophy and [[psychoanalysis]], two ways of thinking which made him very critical of religion, and publicly renounce his Islamic faith at the age of 19.<ref name=\"Delputte\"/>\n\nAfter the [[November 2015 Paris attacks]], which were prepared in the Brussels municipality of [[Sint-Jans-Molenbeek|Molenbeek]], Touzani kept performing in Brussels, despite the heightened fears of new terrorist attacks and amid militarised security forces on the streets. He stated it was important not to give in to fear, and that he would maintain his 'sharp critique of Islamists, nationalists and extremists.'<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20151127_01994086 |title=\u2018Ik heb geen probleem met Allah, wel met zijn extreme fanclub\u2019 |author=Ruud Goossens |work=[[De Standaard]] |date=28 November 2015 |accessdate=6 May 2018 |language=nl}}</ref> His new show ''Les enfants de Dom Juan'', co-written by Ben Hamidou, was his response to the attacks, in which he demands the Muslim community to critically reflect on their beliefs and behaviour, that motivated some of its members towards radicalisation and terrorism.<ref name=\"Renard\">{{Cite news |url=http://www.knack.be/nieuws/belgie/sam-touzani-de-islam-is-de-meest-pornografische-van-alle-godsdiensten/article-normal-806385.html |title=Sam Touzani: 'De islam is de meest pornografische van alle godsdiensten' |author=Han Renard |work=Knack |date=25 January 2017 |accessdate=6 May 2018 |language=nl}}</ref> It also sought to break the taboo on homosexuality and apostasy within the Muslim community.<ref name=\"Delputte\"/> [[Parti Socialiste (Belgium)|Parti Socialiste]] politician [[Philippe Moureaux]] (former [[burgemeester]] of Molenbeek 1993\u20132012) banned Touzani from performing in the municipality for 10 years, and the show was boycotted by the inhabitants and associations of Molenbeek.<ref name=\"Renard\"/>\n\n== Views ==\nTouzani is an 'atheist', an 'ex-Muslim' and 'irreligious', but he doesn't like those terms because they indicate what he is not, while there are many things he does believe in, namely 'humanity, nature and humane laws.'

Neither does he want '[[regressive left|the politically correct left]]' to tell him how to behave, and he refuses to use the term '[[Islamophobia]]', \"not even a second; that concept is being used to make any criticism [of Islam] impossible, and silence the real debate.\"<ref name=\"Delputte\"/> Furthermore, he criticises [[cultural relativism]]: \"Our country emphasies ethnic-religious diversity and rights, while equality, citizenship and transparency come in second place. It should be the other way around.\"<ref name=\"Delputte\"/> According to Touzani, Islam is in desperate need of reform, similar to how the [[Catholic Church]] has implemented an ''[[aggiornamento]]'' at the [[Second Vatican Council]]; otherwise it will disappear due to its 'rigidity'.<ref name=\"Delputte\"/>\n\n== Theatrical shows ==\n* 2002: ''One Human Show'', one man show, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Poche (Brussels)<ref name=\"Frederix\"/>\n* 2003: ''Gembloux ! \u00c0 la recherche de l'arm\u00e9e oubli\u00e9e'', with Ben Hamidou and Sam Touzani, KVS and Avignon (about Moroccan soldiers during [[World War I]])<ref name=\"Frederix\"/>\n* 2004: ''Les Discours du XXi\u00e8me si\u00e8cle'', Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Poche (Brussels)\n* 2005: ''Contes \u00e9rotico-urbains'', by Thomas Gunzig, with Riton Liebman, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Poche (Brussels)\n* 2005: ''Ruben d\u00e9balle tout !'', one man show\n* 2005: ''Allah Super Star'', by Yassir Ben Miloud, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Poche (Brussels)<ref name=\"Frederix\"/>\n* 2006: ''Le Rapport des enfants sur l\u2019\u00e9tat du Monde'', by Stanislas Cotton, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Balsamine\n* 2006: ''Libert\u00e9 \u00e9galit\u00e9 sexualit\u00e9'', one man show by Bernard Breuse and Sam Touzani, KVS\n* 2010: ''Mozaik'', one man show, with Dhalia Pessemiers, Zuideperhuis, Antwerpen\n* 2010: ''Ruben refait le monde'', one man show, [[Francofolies de Spa|Festival of Spa]]\n* 2011: ''\u00c0 port\u00e9e de crachat'', by Taher Najib, with Sam Touzani, Espace Senghor\n* 2011: ''For the Beauty of Confusion'', musical spectacle, with Geike Arnaert, Le Botanique\n* 2012: ''Peur de rien'', one man show, with Richard Ruben, Centre culturel de Woluw\u00e9\n* 2014: ''Papier d\u2019Arm\u00e9nie \u2013 Sans retour possible'', by Caroline Safarian, with Sam Touzani, Espace Magh\n* 2014: ''Rwanda mais avant et puis apr\u00e8s'', by Sou\u00e2d Belhaddad, with Sam Touzani, Centre culturel de Schaerbeek\n* 2014: ''Je suis Belge... mais \u00e7a ne se voit pas'', with Richard Ruben, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Forum, Festival of Avignon\n* 2014: ''Les chaussures de Fadi'' or ''Les Souliers de Fadi'', by Caroline Safarian, with Ben Hamidou, Espace Magh\n* 2015: ''C\u2019est ici que le jour se l\u00e8ve'', by Sam Touzani and Rolland Westreich, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Le Public\n* 2016: ''Les enfants de Dom Juan''\n* 2017: ''Libert\u00e9-Egalit\u00e9-Identit\u00e9'', Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Le Public<ref name=\"Delputte\"/>\n\n== Filmography ==\n=== Films ===\n;Feature films\n* 1997: ''Le Bal masqu\u00e9'' by Julien Vrebos: Nico\n* 1999: ''Deuxi\u00e8me quinzaine de juillet'' by Christophe Reichert: M.

He played as a [[midfielder]] but could also play as a [[defender (association football)|defender]] between 1980 and 1997 notably for [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]], [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]. Webb also played for [[Reading F.C.|Reading]], [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]], [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]], [[Aldershot Town F.C.|Aldershot Town]] and Hong Kong side [[Double Flower FA|Instant-Dict]].\n\n== Club career ==\n===Reading===\nWebb joined [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] on leaving Little Heath School in 1979 and made his first-team debut in February 1980 at the age of 16. He became the youngest ever scorer for the [[Berkshire]] side.\n\n===Portsmouth===\nIn July 1982 he transferred to [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] for \u00a387,500. At [[Fratton Park]] he was a regular first-team player and helped them win promotion to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] (as [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] champions) in his first season, and over the next two seasons they came close to reaching the [[Football League First Division|First Division]].\n\n===Nottingham Forest===\nIn 1985, [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] manager [[Brian Clough]] paid Portsmouth \u00a3250,000<ref name=soccerbase>{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/players_details.sd?playerid=8366|title=Neil Webb - Football Stats - No Club - Age 54 - 1980-1997 - Soccer Base|website=www.soccerbase.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}</ref> for Webb. At Forest he developed into a top class [[midfielder (soccer)|midfielder]] with a strong goalscoring record. During his time on Trentside he won the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] in 1989 (scoring in the final against Luton) and became a regular member of the [[England national football team|England]] national team from 1987. Webb was one of the Forest players who had to cope with the horrors of the [[Hillsborough disaster]] during the opening minutes of their FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool.\n\nHis goalscoring record at Forest exceeded that of many strikers at the time. He managed 14 league goals in both of his first two seasons at the club, in [[1986\u201387 in English football|1986\u201387]] from just 32 games. This included a hat-trick against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in September 1986 that sent him to the top of the League's scoring charts.<ref>{{cite news|title=Two hat-tricks put Forest on top|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=i2spAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Y-YDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3995%2C4911865|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|page=50|date=22 September 1986|accessdate=20 October 2014}}</ref> He scored 13 times in the [[1987\u201388 in English football|1987\u201388]] league campaign, though his goalscoring totally was lower in [[1988\u201389 in English football|1988\u201389]] (six goals from 30 games) it did nothing to diminish his reputation as a first class midfielder.<ref name=\"sporting-heroes.net\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football-heroes/displayhero_club.asp?HeroID=44408|title=Football photographic encyclopedia, footballer, world cup, champions league, football championship, olympic games & hero images by sporting-heroes.net|website=www.sporting-heroes.net|accessdate=3 April 2018}}</ref> He scored for Forest against [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] in the [[1989 Football League Cup Final]] which they went on to win.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cloughs prove to be a dynamic duo: Luton Town 1, Nottingham Forest 3|newspaper=The Herald|location=Glasgow|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WDFAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QFkMAAAAIBAJ&pg=5145%2C2833477|date=10 April 1989|accessdate=20 October 2014|first=Ian|last=Paul|page=17}}</ref>\n\n===Manchester United===\nIn July 1989 he joined [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].

Webb scored on his league debut on 19 August 1989, when they achieved a 4\u20131 home win over defending league champions [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] on the opening day of the [[1989\u201390 in English football|1989\u201390 season]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.manchester-united-fans-site.com/manchester-united-results-1989-1990.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426175846/http://www.manchester-united-fans-site.com/manchester-united-results-1989-1990.html |archivedate=26 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nHe joined United at a time when they were entering their fourth season under the management of [[Alex Ferguson]], but had yet to win a major trophy under him in spite of heavy spending on new players \u2013 with Webb arriving around the same time as [[Danny Wallace (footballer)|Danny Wallace]], [[Mike Phelan]] and [[Gary Pallister]].<ref name=soccerbase />\n\nAfter just a few games at United, Webb snapped his [[achilles tendon]] while playing a match for England against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] in September 1989.<ref name = \"Webb returns\">{{cite news|title=Webb returns to first team duty|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KLJUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=apADAAAAIBAJ&pg=4594%2C4895477|newspaper=New Straits Times|location=Kuala Lumpur|date=31 March 1990|accessdate=20 October 2014|agency=Reuters|page=22}}</ref> Webb made his comeback for United as a substitute against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] on 24 March 1990, and made his first start since the injury the following Saturday, at home to [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]].<ref name=\"Webb returns\" /> Despite positive early indications - [[Reuters]] called him the \"most influential player on the pitch\" during a September 1990 clash with Luton Town<ref>{{cite news|title=Everton, Villa hope to overcome crisis|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4aNUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=F5ADAAAAIBAJ&pg=6726%2C1936682|newspaper=New Straits Times|location=Kuala Lumpur|date=7 September 1990|page=26|accessdate=20 October 2014|agency=Reuters}}</ref> - he never returned to his previous form, suffering from weight problems and other injuries.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Rice|first=Xan|date=9 May 2004|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/osm/story/0,,1210206,00.html|title=When the music stops: Part 1|work=Observer Sport Monthly|publisher=The Observer}}</ref> Webb was still a precise passer of the ball and was included in the England [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]] squad, having return to action during the second half of the 1989\u201390 season. He also helped Manchester United win the [[FA Cup]] in 1990, [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] in 1991, and [[Football League Cup]] in 1992.\n\nIn the 1990 FA Cup final, he memorably hit a clinical 50-yard pass to [[Lee Martin (footballer born February 1968)|Lee Martin]] who subsequently scored the winning goal in the FA Cup Final replay.\n\nHe played in 31 out of 42 First Division games for Manchester United in [[1991\u201392 in English football|1991\u201392]], but missed the final few games of the season due to a rift with manager [[Alex Ferguson]] \u2013 some fans even blamed United's failure to win the league title that season on Webb. He famously dawdled off the pitch after being subbed in a game v Forest on Easter Monday. Furthermore,  Webb would regularly feign injury when there was a forthcoming midweek England game.\n\nHe was also faced with stiff competition for a place in the centre or on the right of midfield - as well as Bryan Robson and three midfielders who had joined United in 1989, he was now faced with competition from [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] winger [[Andrei Kanchelskis]].\n\nWebb only played one more game before leaving United.\n\n===Return to Forest===\nHe returned to Nottingham Forest for \u00a3800,000 on 23 November 1992.<ref name=\"sporting-heroes.net\"/> His second spell at Forest was unsuccessful, as he could not win a regular first-team place because of the emergence of other players like [[Steve Stone (footballer)|Steve Stone]] and [[Lars Bohinen]]. He made just nine league appearances in [[1992\u201393 in English football|1992\u201393]] as Forest were relegated, but when manager [[Brian Clough]] retired and was succeeded by [[Frank Clark (footballer)|Frank Clark]], he had more first team opportunities, playing 21 league games and scoring three goals as Forest were promoted back to the Premier League as Division One runners-up.\n\nWebb never played league football for Forest again after the 1994 promotion, though he remained contracted to the club for another two years.\n\nHe had a spell on loan back at [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] in the [[1995\u201396 in English football|1995\u201396 season]] before finally leaving Forest for good in the summer of 1996.\n\n===Late playing career===\nHe signed for [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]].

Webb also played for [[Reading F.C.|Reading]], [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]], [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]], [[Aldershot Town F.C.|Aldershot Town]] and Hong Kong side [[Double Flower FA|Instant-Dict]].\n\n== Club career ==\n===Reading===\nWebb joined [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] on leaving Little Heath School in 1979 and made his first-team debut in February 1980 at the age of 16. He became the youngest ever scorer for the [[Berkshire]] side.\n\n===Portsmouth===\nIn July 1982 he transferred to [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] for \u00a387,500. At [[Fratton Park]] he was a regular first-team player and helped them win promotion to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] (as [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] champions) in his first season, and over the next two seasons they came close to reaching the [[Football League First Division|First Division]].\n\n===Nottingham Forest===\nIn 1985, [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] manager [[Brian Clough]] paid Portsmouth \u00a3250,000<ref name=soccerbase>{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/players_details.sd?playerid=8366|title=Neil Webb - Football Stats - No Club - Age 54 - 1980-1997 - Soccer Base|website=www.soccerbase.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}</ref> for Webb. At Forest he developed into a top class [[midfielder (soccer)|midfielder]] with a strong goalscoring record. During his time on Trentside he won the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] in 1989 (scoring in the final against Luton) and became a regular member of the [[England national football team|England]] national team from 1987. Webb was one of the Forest players who had to cope with the horrors of the [[Hillsborough disaster]] during the opening minutes of their FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool.\n\nHis goalscoring record at Forest exceeded that of many strikers at the time. He managed 14 league goals in both of his first two seasons at the club, in [[1986\u201387 in English football|1986\u201387]] from just 32 games.

The band made its breakthrough in the metal scene with its 2002 album ''Cold Black Piece of Flesh''. The second album ''Escaping the Stupor'' was released on [[Black Lotus Records]]. Their music combines melodic passages with old school death metal, and their lyrics deal with personal experiences and opinions from Christian point of view.\n\n==Biography==\nSacrificium has its roots in a band called Hardway, formed by Sebastian Wagner and Oliver Tesch. Musically, the band was [[pop rock]] oriented. That changed in 1991, when the session drummer Markus Hauth took the direction more towards [[hard rock]] sound. In 1992, Hardway performed at the reputive Steiger 14 club in [[Amsterdam]], the [[Netherlands]]. The band name was changed to Corpus Christi <small>(not to be confused with [[Corpus Christi (band)|Corpus Christi]] from [[Ohio]])</small> in 1993 and they began playing [[thrash metal]]. The style developed to death metal, and in 1994, after recording a demo, the name was changed to Sacrificium.\n\nAfter a few line up changes in 1996, Sacrificium recorded its second demo and in 1998 another demo titled ''Mortal Fear'' was released. Although the demos were well-received, the vocalist Roman Wagner left Sacrificium in 2000. After that, the band played concerts with bands such as [[Extol]], Dismember, Unleashed, The black Dahlia Murder or My Darkest Hate. The second guitarist, Claudio Enzler, started performing vocals, and the guitarist position was taken by Ulrike Uhlmann.\n\nIn 2002 Sacrificium was signed to Whirlwind Records, who published the band's debut ''Cold Black Piece of Flesh''. The album caught the attention of the press, and received positive reviews. For example, ''Rock Hard'' gave it 7.5/10 in its February 2004 issue. Afterwards they toured Europe with the band brain[faq].\n\nOn November 28, 2005, Sacrificium released its second album ''Escaping the Stupor'' on the Greek metal label Black Lotus Records.  The album features guest performances by Karl Walfridsson of [[Pantokrator (band)|Pantokrator]] and Simon Ros\u00e9n of [[Crimson Moonlight]].  ''Escaping the Stupor'' was well-received: ''Rock Hard'' gave it 7.5/10, Legacy 10/15 and Metalnews.de 6/7.\n\nThe band is currently working on new material and is updating its Facebook bulletin with pre-production demo takes and news.\n\nFounding Guitarist Oliver Tesch left the band in 2012, and was replaced by Wolfgang Nillies.\n\nGuitarist Matthias Brandt and bassplayer Thorsten Brandt left the band on October 30, 2015 and have been replaced later on by Fred Berger and former member Ulrike Uhlmann.\n\nOn January 6, 2019, it was announced that longtime Drummer Mario Henning was departing from the band.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://mauce.nl/site/long-time-sacrificium-drummer-mario-henning-leaves-band-statement-available/|title=Long-Time 'Sacrificium' Drummer 'Mario Henning' Leaves Band (Statement Available)|website=The Metal Resource|date=January 6, 2019|accessdate=January 10, 2019}}</ref> and therefore they had to cancel their Mexico tour which would have been in April 2019.\nAt the same time the band announced to release an EP ''The Avowal of the Centurion'' in early 2019 and a full-length record in 2020.

The band made its breakthrough in the metal scene with its 2002 album ''Cold Black Piece of Flesh''. The second album ''Escaping the Stupor'' was released on [[Black Lotus Records]]. Their music combines melodic passages with old school death metal, and their lyrics deal with personal experiences and opinions from Christian point of view.\n\n==Biography==\nSacrificium has its roots in a band called Hardway, formed by Sebastian Wagner and Oliver Tesch. Musically, the band was [[pop rock]] oriented. That changed in 1991, when the session drummer Markus Hauth took the direction more towards [[hard rock]] sound. In 1992, Hardway performed at the reputive Steiger 14 club in [[Amsterdam]], the [[Netherlands]]. The band name was changed to Corpus Christi <small>(not to be confused with [[Corpus Christi (band)|Corpus Christi]] from [[Ohio]])</small> in 1993 and they began playing [[thrash metal]]. The style developed to death metal, and in 1994, after recording a demo, the name was changed to Sacrificium.\n\nAfter a few line up changes in 1996, Sacrificium recorded its second demo and in 1998 another demo titled ''Mortal Fear'' was released. Although the demos were well-received, the vocalist Roman Wagner left Sacrificium in 2000. After that, the band played concerts with bands such as [[Extol]], Dismember, Unleashed, The black Dahlia Murder or My Darkest Hate. The second guitarist, Claudio Enzler, started performing vocals, and the guitarist position was taken by Ulrike Uhlmann.\n\nIn 2002 Sacrificium was signed to Whirlwind Records, who published the band's debut ''Cold Black Piece of Flesh''. The album caught the attention of the press, and received positive reviews. For example, ''Rock Hard'' gave it 7.5/10 in its February 2004 issue. Afterwards they toured Europe with the band brain[faq].\n\nOn November 28, 2005, Sacrificium released its second album ''Escaping the Stupor'' on the Greek metal label Black Lotus Records.  The album features guest performances by Karl Walfridsson of [[Pantokrator (band)|Pantokrator]] and Simon Ros\u00e9n of [[Crimson Moonlight]].  ''Escaping the Stupor'' was well-received: ''Rock Hard'' gave it 7.5/10, Legacy 10/15 and Metalnews.de 6/7.\n\nThe band is currently working on new material and is updating its Facebook bulletin with pre-production demo takes and news.\n\nFounding Guitarist Oliver Tesch left the band in 2012, and was replaced by Wolfgang Nillies.\n\nGuitarist Matthias Brandt and bassplayer Thorsten Brandt left the band on October 30, 2015 and have been replaced later on by Fred Berger and former member Ulrike Uhlmann.\n\nOn January 6, 2019, it was announced that longtime Drummer Mario Henning was departing from the band.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://mauce.nl/site/long-time-sacrificium-drummer-mario-henning-leaves-band-statement-available/|title=Long-Time 'Sacrificium' Drummer 'Mario Henning' Leaves Band (Statement Available)|website=The Metal Resource|date=January 6, 2019|accessdate=January 10, 2019}}</ref> and therefor they have to cancel their Mexico tour which would have been in April 2019\nAt the same time the band announced to release an EP ''The Avowal of the Centurion'' in early 2019 and a full-length record in 2020.
