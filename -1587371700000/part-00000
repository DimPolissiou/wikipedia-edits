To illustrate this, consider the following example.\n\nThere are three bidders with only two possible slots. The values of\neach bidders 1, 2, and 3 are $10, $5, and $3 respectively. Suppose that the first slot click\nthrough rate (CTR) is 300 and the second slot CTR is 290. If bidder 1 is truthful, he\nwould have to pay <math>p_1 = \\$5(300) = \\$1500</math> for a utility of <math>u_1 = \\$10(300)-\\$1500 = \\$1500</math>.\nHowever, if bidder 1 decides to lie and reports a value of $4 instead then his utility\nwould be <math>u_2 = \\$10(290) - \\$3(290) = \\$2030</math>. Notice that <math>u_2 > u_1</math> which makes GSP\nuntruthful and bidders have an incentive to lie.\n\n====Quality Variant====\nGoogle uses a minor variant of GSP to auction off advertisement slots. Potential\nadvertisements may be of varying quality. Suppose that there are two advertisements\nfor eggs. One advertisement simply fills its space with the word \u201cegg\u201d repeated over\nand over, while the other advertisement shows a picture of eggs, contains branding\ninformation, and mentions positive qualities about their eggs, such as cage-freeness.\nThe second advertisement may be thought of as having higher quality than the first\nadvertisement, being more useful to consumers, more likely to be clicked on, and more\nlikely to generate revenue for both the advertiser and Google. Advertisements that\nhave a history of high click through rates, are geographically targeted at the user, or\nhave a high quality landing page may also be thought of as having higher quality.<ref>Google AdWords, Check and understand Quality Score. support.google.com/adwords/answer/2454010</ref>\n\nGoogle assigns a numeric \u201cquality\u201d score <math>\\gamma_i</math> to each bidder <math>i</math>. Bidders, rather than\nbeing ordered purely by their bid, are instead ordered by rank, which is the product\nof their bid and quality score <math>\\gamma_1 b_1 \\geq \\gamma_2 b_2 \\geq \\dots \\geq \\gamma_n b_n</math> . Slots are still assigned in\ndecreasing rank order. Bidders are charged, rather than the bid of the bidder one rank\nlower (<math>p_i(b_i, b_{-i}) = b_{i+1}</math>), are charged the minimum price for which, if it was their bid,\nwould keep them in their current rank: <math>p_i(b_i, b_{-i}) = \\frac{\\gamma_{i+1}b_{i+1}}{\\gamma_i}</math>\n\n===Vickrey\u2013Clarke\u2013Groves Auction===\n[[Vickrey\u2013Clarke\u2013Groves auction]] (VCG) is a truthful auction optimizing social welfare.
